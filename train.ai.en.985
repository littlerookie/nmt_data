happy? I haven't been happy for ten years.
change the record. I'll play it as often as I want.
why couldn't we have had Cedric after Edmund instead of you?
even Harold would have been better by a whisker.
what will happen to this place when I go?
don't be so morbid. Morbid?
with my space already booked out there in that mausoleum?
quite an exciting life you lead, Emma says.
it has its moments.
I doubt it compares with being a fighter pilot.
that seems a long way back.
I fly a desk now for an insurance outfit.
dull isn't the word.
this must be a bit of a come-down for you.
it suits me very well. I've an aunt in Brackhampton.
a sweet old thing.
I thought I'd see her occasionally, if I have time.
I'll fetch the apple tart. Oh, and there's cheese.
and may I call my aunt?
of course.
the family were here on the 4th.
the day of the murder
where would someone with knowledge of the estate conceal a body?
where is Alfred's missing girlfriend Jacqueline Briggs?
that's what you must concentrate on.
it's in the next chapter, Miss Hartnell, but I won't spoil it for you
wait until the end. There's a very ingenious twist.
bye-bye
good night.
it's a shame it's so run-down.
I suppose with the war and sweets still on ration
Crackenthorpe Confectionary doesn't figure.
old Marcus sold it off.
Luther inherited this, but has to run it on the interest from a trust fund he shares with us.
in my case, through Alexander. It's pretty small change.
poor Emma won't see any of the fund when it pays out on Luther's death.
that's real bucks. How unfair.
she's a woman.
luther's hands are tied by his old man's crazy will.
they fell out. Family stuff.
well, can't he sell?
no.
Rutherford Hall has to pass to Alfred.
since Edmund died, he's the eldest son.
what's that? The mausoleum.
the last resting place of the Crackenthorpes.
Lucy! Lucy! Hide and seek, Lucy!
Lucy! Lucy! Hide and seek!
that's Miss Eyelesbarrow to you.
but she said we can call her Lucy.
didn't you, Miss Eyelesbarrow?
I didn't say you could scream it.
will you play with us? Please.
please. I'll do the sprouts.
Hooray! Hooray!
then bed.
100? Yes.
there's no fish-and-chip shop in St Mary Mead, so I thought it'd be a nice treat.
you always were a bad fibber.
I looked in your larder. I'll shop.
what would I see from my train where the railway curves along an embankment?
a large estate and a house?
Rutherford Hall.
now, that is interesting.
I heard a lecture at the history society.
now the place is cut off from Brackhampton, but that was the railway.
in 1838
the company offered the family ï¿¡900 for a slice of land, so the railway could keep going in a straight line, supposedly.
the representative got a biff on the nose and was sent packing.
so the track had to skirt the estate at great cost.
that acreage these days I hate to think what that's worth.
do you know the family?
the Crackenthorpes? No. The doctor's an acquaintance.
nice chap. I think he's quite keen on the daughter.
are you up to something, Miss Marple?
am I?
Lucy! Lucy! Coming!
I hope you don't mind my asking, Mr. Crackenthorpe, but...
did you never think to join in the family business?
I had a vision.
I saw my life unfolding before me, drowning in a sea of sticky toffee and pretending enthusiasm for a new line in coconut fudge.
no, thank you, Dad
I told him. "I have a soul, even if you don't
he was a spiteful man, cut me out of his will.
he made sure his wealth skipped a generation.
but at least I stood up to him.
was that before you were married?
Yes, but money didn't mean anything to Agnes.
she was a wonderful mother.
I stood up to him and she understood why.
I buried myself in my books and got the sort of liberal education he despised.
we were happy, believe it or not.
Mr. Crackenthorpe.
she's gone.
I'll never see her again.
Jacqueline?
Yes.
may I sit down?
tell me about her.
she wasn't what you'd call... beautiful.
but her eyes... One look, you know.
putty in her hands. Any man who ever met her.
what happened?
she wanted to finish it.
I begged her not to.
but she wouldn't listen.
I know I'm not a very good sort. I do know that.
look, it's never too late to face up to something terrible.
I can't.
I think you know what happened to her, don't you?
tell me.
she's...
she's...
run off with Councillor bloody Marchant!
wait. You mean...she's not dead?
dead? No.
I just hope none of them press charges.
none of whom?
none of the fat stupid, married pillars of Brackhampton society, who looked into Jackie's eyes in assorted hotel bedrooms and turned to putty.
just long enough for me to burst in and play the wronged husband, except she really fell for the last one.
Marchant.
that's dreadful.
heartbreaking.
it was a bloody good little earner.
Oh, excuse me.
I could do with some coffee.
black.
make it yourself, Mr. Crackenthorpe.

in MEMORIAM EDMUND LOST AT SEA
Edith EASTLEY DEAR WIFE AND MOTHER AGED 20
in FOND MEMORY OF AGNES CRACKENTHORPE
in MEMORY OF A DEAR HUSBAND AND FATHER LUTHER CRACKENTHORPE
miss Eyelesbarrow? Yes
detective lnspector Campbell, Brackhampton ClD.
he's taken to his bed again.
it's you I'm worried about.
the police are getting Harold and Alice to come. And Cedric.
he was supposed to be going back to Spain today, but they've called the airport.
what was Miss Eyelesbarrow doing in the mausoleum anyway?
you suffer from insomnia, and went for a midnight walk, then you looked in the mausoleum to see what it was like.
no. No?
that's what I told Miss Crackenthorpe, but...
I was looking for the body.
a friend of mine told me it was somewhere here.
why would he or she think there was a body at Rutherford Hall?
she. A friend of hers saw the woman murdered on a train.
I know it sounds improbable, but my friend is never wrong.
let me guess your friend's name.
Tom's father was the best village constable St Mary Mead ever had.
much missed.
I have a confession to make.
I did it.
I scrumped the apples from the Price-Ridley's orchard.
I know. It's obvious.
but you learnt your lesson, falling into the nettle patch.
the screams.
I had him down to his birthday suit and smothered every little bit of him in calamine lotion.
now, we have our victim, but we don't know who she is.
I wonder if these will help.
they're very commonplace.
if not to say common.
but thanks to Lucy, we know she wasn't Jacqueline Briggs.
the family didn't recognise the photos of the body or so they say.
we're holding back where she was murdered for the moment.
I'll keep my ears open.
miss Eyelesbarrow, you found the body and I'm very grateful.
but I can't let you go back. You could be in danger.
a victim without a murderer is like...
I don't know what it's like.
I hate to leave a job half done.
and I promised to work at Rutherford Hall so I can't let them down, can I?
do hurry up, Harold. And, you, be careful with that.
it's Dior.
it's a year's golf club membership and some good cigars.
lend a hand, will you?
what?
put my jacket on a puddle for her ladyship to walk over?
I've no wish to soil my shoes on your jacket, Alfred.
how long will we have to stay, Inspector?
we're expected for a Christmas house party in Suffolk.
well, that would depend on the progress of my investigation.
the sergeant will be showing you some photographs later of the body to see if any of you recognise the woman.
what does it say, Harold?
they think she died on Tuesday of last week.
I don't see how they can tell. Not from the look of her is doesn't say when she was placed in the mausoleum.
no idea who she is?
they're appealing for information.
Cedric, you've arrived. You know me.
can't resist a whodunnit.
hello.
haven't seen you before.
scrambled eggs? Rather.
I was about to board the plane when I was taken aside.
very dramatic.
they showed me those terrible photographs.
did you recognise her?
sadly, yes.
she was an ex-lover who never got over me.
pester, pester, pester.
so I done her in.
how very amusing.
I'm glad to see that you haven't lost your sense of humour
Alice, my sweet.
I'll thank you not to use that tone with my wife.
don't be so pompous, Harold.
# Here we are again, as happy as can be # All good friends and jolly good company
Oh, there you are! Dad.
it's all terrible. There's a flatfoot in the library.
can you tell me where you were between five and six o'clock on Tuesday 4th December?
I was here
how did you get here? I drove.
arrived early afternoon.
but the place seemed deserted.
had a drink or three.
and waited.
I drove up to take Emma to Brackhampton Christmas shopping.
she never gets out of the house.
boys were due on the Friday.
I knew I'd have my hands full then.
I can't remember which shops exactly.
Greenford's, I expect.
and Lyle and Swift. Bryan was with me the whole time.
we didn't get back till gone six.
my father was in one of his moods.
he doesn't much like my going out in the afternoons.
he shuts himself in his room and wouldn't speak to me.
was Alfred around when you arrived?
Yes. Yes, he was.
I believe he'd been here for some time.
I picked Lady Alice up from old friends of hers and we came on here.
alfred was drunk.
Ah, you're here at last.
How're the Hendersons?
at the time of the murder, I was in my studio.
touching up Two Senoritas and A Donkey.
which is the title of a painting that I have to finish for the next exhibition in January.
I lost track of the time, I missed the evening flight and I didn't arrive until the next day.
if it is from her! How do we know?
she didn't turn up anywhere, did she? Quite.
of course not. It's a put-up job. Is that Martine's letter?
they were just sitting chatting having coffee
rather a pleasant change.
I heard a huge row.
no idea what about.
there never has to be a reason.
Cedric or Luther is lying about the argument the family were having.
however, Alfred's the only one without a real alibi.
do you want me to watch him? I want you... to be careful of him.
you've got some erm...
that's better.
you, too.
Yeah.
use some gumption!
Ah, Miss Eyelesbarrow.
your sister's digging out red ribbon for the festive touch.
I've just been checking your references.
have you?
Yes, I spoke to Lord Leasely and Miss Van Moyson.
everything seems to be in order.
did you think I'd forged them?
I don't know what I thought, actually.
I saw you and the Inspector emerging from coal house earlier
Oh, yes. He was asking me some more questions.
Oh, no. You were far too furtive.
I must say, he's a man of taste.
was he indulging it?
Lucy?
everything OK?
Eastley.
keep away from him. Please.
I can look after myself, Bryan.
you bring out my protective side, that's all.
why is that?
because you're special.
and beautiful.
Oh.
well, that's something to think about, isn't it?
put it back.
david says we should tell the police.
you and your bloody doctor! No!
it would upset father too much.
have the fox fur and the compact yielded anything?
what about the clothes? It's on the cheap side.
nothing special. There were a few items with Spanish labels.
Spanish? And the compact is French.
I spoke to the manufacturer in Paris.
they don't export.
so she must have bought it in France.
perhaps she was French.
or Spanish.
or travelled widely.
come on, Stoddard-West.
will there be another murder?
we'll listen for clues down by the lake.
can't Bryan control those children?
it's giving me a headache.
bad enough being cooped up without having...
leave them alone.
they're looking for clues.
that inspector said the dead woman might not be British.
did he tell you that? No.
what, French?
he didn't say.
all I said was not British but Emma immediately assumed French.
she looks scared.
Yes, Aunt.
of course. But I am really rather busy.
goodbye. Goodbye.
what were the victim's feet like?
her feet?
Why? It may be nothing.
but it could be something.
I'll let you see the postmortem report.
there's Quimper now.
I told you he always pops in for a cup of tea after surgery.
David!
join us.
Hello, Tom.
this is Miss Marple.
Jane Marple, Dr. David Quimper.
nice to meet you, Miss Marple. Dr. Quimper.
I'm an old friend from childhood days.
his, not mine, of course.
are you visiting Brackhampton?
I'm staying at the most charming guesthouse.
seeing something of the town. Catching up with Tom and his doings.
and my niece at Rutherford Hall. I can see her too
your niece? Lucy Eyelesbarrow.
she found a body, you know.
I do yes
how's the investigation?
it's nowhere until we've made an identification. How's Emma?
taking it in her stride, as usual.
And? You and her?
pretend I'm not here.
but I do love the scent of romance in the air.
you're in luck, then, Miss Marple.
Emma and I are engaged.
I asked her the other day. Well done.
unofficial. We're not telling the family yet.
mum's the word.
have you known the Crackenthorpes long?
I just started my practice down here.
I saw Emma's mother out of the world.
it's only love that matters.
love, not money.
Agnes never lived to see Edmund's wife.
how tragic.
he brought her home just after she died.
she was so very beautiful - Martine.
and shortly afterwards, Edmund himself was killed in the ocean.
Martine? She was French.
what happened to her? Doctor?
the family don't know.
excuse me.
a rather demanding patient, I'm afraid.
nice to meet you.
the family does know.
or at least one of them does. Well, why would he lie?
I think you should ask Emma Crackenthorpe that.
if our body is Edmund's widow Martine, why would anyone want to kill her?
shall we fight over the last cream horn?
was it David who told you I'd heard from Martine?
no. In fact, he lied for you.
he said I should have shown it to you all along.
how did you find out?
it was...my intuition.
it arrived out of the blue a fortnight ago.
after Edmund was killed,
Martine cut herself off from us, until this.
she'd built a new life, she says.
but now she wants money to give her son their son some of life's advantages.
we had no idea there was a child.
no address.
she just announced she was coming here to meet everyone.
I telephoned the others as soon as it came.
she says she'll come on Tuesday. December 4th, yes.
the day you think this woman was murdered.
she has a son. The child is family.
if it is from her. How do we know?
she didn't turn up anyway, did she? Quite.
of course not. It's a put-up job.
we only met Martine once, ten years ago.
those awful photos.
if by any chance it was her, how could any of us tell?
why didn't you mention this?
my brothers didn't want a fuss.
they knew Martine was coming, but she never arrived.
not alive, at least, if it was her.
she wanted money.
the trust fund income would be more miserable if another share came out of it.
we'll clean the stove tomorrow.
no, honestly... A bachelor kitchen only goes so far, before it becomes quite unpleasant.
I remember the Brownlows' eldest boy - Cecil.
of course, he never married. That's another matter.
you will one day. pity your wife, Tom Campbell.
one day, perhaps.
what?
the eldest son. The real prize is Rutherford Hall.
that would be worth killing for.
if it was discovered that Edmund had a son it would go to him, the eldest son of the eldest son.
he's an unpleasant specimen, Alfred.
it would certainly give him a strong motive, if the body is Martine.
mm, I suppose it would.
such a pity I can't meet the family.
I've got the er...the pathologist's report for you.
lovely.
Oh, do you know...
I'll take it to bed with my cocoa.
Night-night.
Night-night.
thank you.
halfway through chapter one and they were off.
you, too.
Yes.
good night. Good night, Lucy.
Harry, my sweet!
dad, we've found a clue! We have, Mr. Eastley.
what's this? Look, Dad.
it's receipt for dress or something from Mrs. M Crackenthorpe
impossible.
who's Mrs. M Crackenthorpe?
where did you find this? Stuck in the holly bush.
can I have a look, old boy?
the police should see this.
all right, skedaddle, boys. Find me some more clues.
you'll have to tell Dad now. I can't!
let's get it out of the way before Christmas.
the way things are going, we'll all still be here.
em, if it was Martine then we're all under suspicion.
alfred has no alibi at all.
Harold has Alice to swear black is white for him, and I am lying through my teeth, as you well know.
then you're lying too, Em.
Bryan didn't take you shopping on the day of the murder.
Bryan arrived by train.
I picked him up from Brackhampton Station just before 6 o'clock.
he asked me to.
and asked you to lie about it?
Oh, I should have telephoned first, I know.
Lucy says you're all so kind.
I did... I did promise her mother
I'd keep an eye on her.
Oh! Is that a Gainsborough?
school of. Ghastly.
biscuit tin stuff.
who's that other G?
Gauguin.
Ah, now you're talking!
I'm afraid all his yellow makes me rather bilious.
this is my brother Cedric.
how do you do? How do you do?
of course you and Gauguin have something in common, don't you?
his talent flourished on an island.
aunt Jane?
what do you do, Mr. Crackenthorpe?
a bit of this, a bit of that.
precious little of either most of the time.
my family had a Marple once. Scullery maid.
interestingly, Lady Alice is from a very old family...
what does that mean? We all come from old families.
and I know an Angus Marple. Owns horses and a castle.
if you know someone who knows someone who owns horses and a castle, you're laughing.
my brother is.
job for life with his father-in-law's company.
whatever it is you do there.
Harold has a responsible position.
doesn't pay just quite enough, though, does it, Harry?
you get your bread buttered but it's spread damn thin.
Alfred!
money can be such a thing, can't it?
Hello, Tom. Are you on duty?
Yes. Meeting someone. You?
just delivered twins. I've a very lovely job sometimes.
David...
what do you make of Alfred Crackenthorpe?
he's a wreck
Why? Is he your suspect?
you know I can't answer that.
Emma says...
you asked them all their whereabouts between five and six.
well...I know where Alfred was.
I saw him in the King's Head.
he didn't tell me that.
he was with old Terry, the bookie's runner.
he'd hardly tell policeman he was doing some illegal betting now, would he?
thank you, David.
so nice to meet you.
I'm sorry my father wasn't up to seeing you.
I quite understand. Ooh, I met your Dr. Quimper yesterday.
what a charming man. My Dr. Quimper?
your family's.
Oh, yes.
Lucy, won't you introduce me to your aunt?
we haven't time, Mr. Eastley.
goodbye. Goodbye.
has he upset you? No.
he's very handsome, isn't he?
in an American sort of way, I suppose.
he's certainly very forward.
thank you, Lucy. What did you find out?
enough for now. What next?
Elspeth described the woman she saw strangled with her hair scraped back under a band.
bunions, according to the pathologist.
and soles like leather.
and her toenails were clipped short.
so where exactly are we off to?
remember little Elsie Elliot, from Church Lane, who won a scholarship to ballet school?
she showed me her feet once.
our victim had dancer's feet, and she travelled abroad.
and it's Christmas, Tom.
you could stay for dinner.
I've got a patient to visit.
are you still here? I was just going.
not changing, Cedric? No.
wish you could change, though. Bet Harold does, too.
I've told Dad about Martine.
I don't think he'll be down.
I'm sorry. I thought it was best, now that the police know.
well...
good night, everyone.
here, doc.
what do you charge for a consultation?
whatever it is, it's not enough.
good evening, brood.
I wonder if another body will turn up.
I hope not. I hope it won't be you. I like you.
thank you. Dad likes you, too.
I think what he needs is a... a proper home life.
he needs looking after.
smells good.
sorry we won't be able to eat it.
we have to return James to his mother.
she's just got back from abroad and seen the papers.
understandably, she wants him home.
can't I stay? It's curry. No, you can't.
keep James company
get your coat.
looks good, too.
Lucy.
it's the onions.
just go.
the INTERNATIONAL CHRISTMAS TOUR. BALLET MARITSKI. NOW BOOKING.
and...
Oh, no, no, no, no!
no, no, no! This is The Nutcracker, not The Carnival of the Animals.
you look like an elephant!
and then...
the arms like this. Lightness... With lightness.
and leger.
you're a fairy made of sugar, Cherie, not a dumpling.
be quiet, or I'll crack your nuts.
when I um...
when I telephoned you, Madame Joilet, you said this dancer Anna Stravinska left after the performance on December 3rd and you've never seen her since.
correct. Our last night at Little Hampton.
a modest venue, but a standing ovation.
the next night we opened in Southsea, but Anna never arrived.
to be frank, she was...getting on.
it's a short life as a dancer.
if she was a horse...
she would be...put out to grass?
no, no, Inspector.
I think you say the knacker's yard.
do you have any idea where Miss Stravinska might be now?
girls disappear, especially on tour.
it's not uncommon.
perhaps she got herself into trouble, if you understand.
but no. Not with Anna.
that's not likely.
she's a very good Catholic.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Catholic? From Russia?
Russia?
Oh, her name. No, no, no, no.
it's a fashion with ballet dancers. Anna is French.
do you know her real name? No.
she had an English husband, she told me.
had. Is he still alive?
all I know is she is no longer with him.
where did they marry?
london, I believe.
and er...did they have a son
impossible!
one cannot have a child and dance.
how was the curry? Excellent.
thank you.
there's nothing like plain, simple cooking, is there?
I'll cancel the Savoy, then. Harold!
stop bickering.
I thought the curry was delicious.
it was certainly hot, Miss Eyelesbarrow.
after you with the water. May I have some, too?
I'll fetch some more.
dad, please don't be upset. Why not?
I just found out I've got a grandson I've never seen and his poor mother's body ends up on my grounds.
shouldn't I be upset?
I'm seriously thinking of joining her.
perhaps grief would unite you. Not joy.
for God's sake, shut up!
you're so bloody boring, father.
sit down ! dad!
you're just as bad.
I thought I could trust you. Of course you can.
can I? Who hid the letter from me, then?
dad!
miss Eyelesbarrow, the curry!
Phone...Dr...Quimper!
Dr. Quimper. I've left the light on.
you will close the door behind you? Yes.
how are they? They're all sound asleep, probably best for them.
I'll be in...first thing, just to make sure.
good night. Yes. Good night, Miss Eyelesbarrow.
help! Help me!
Dr. Quimper!
help! Help!
that was Alfred.
he's dead.
I think it was arsenic.
it's unpredictable, even in small doses.
his system was weak.
alfred did drink more in a month than most of us manage in six.
how sure are you?
well, I kept some of the sample for your lab boys.
they're the experts.
I dropped it off at police station. Thank you, David.
you're next in line now...
till Harold gets it.
and then it'll be all mines.
stay here.
what happened?
Alfred's dead.
Lucy, what's the matter?
you're not serious? You're there when I was cooking.
you made sure Alexander went with you when you took James back to his mother.
why would I wanna kill Alfred, or anyone, for that matter?
why would you lie about where you were the day Martine was murdered?
you didn't drive here to go shopping.
you came by train. You met Emma once the shops were shut.
how do you know? I keep my ears open, Bryan.
did you include spying on your resume when you applied for this post?
in any case, I couldn't have killed Martine.
why not? I can't say.
it would mean breaking a confidence. How convenient.
you know what, have it your own way, then.
what about the others?
is any of them seriously ill?
they didn't need hospital. Unpleasant, though.
Quimper thinks it was probably arsenic.
he took some of the curry to test.
miss Marple, I have to get...
why would the whole family be poisoned?
to kill off the weakest member -Alfred.
Quimper said he was a physical wreck.
one of the family was prepared to poison himself to get the hands on the inheritance
or the murderer meant to poison Luther but killed Alfred instead.
possibly.
Lucy's sure she never left the kitchen.
only four people, apart from Alexander, came in.
mr Eastley was first.
looks good, too.
then Cedric appeared.
shall I put some of this in?
food colouring. A blue curry.
so avant-garde!
No!
she's not sure how long Harold was there, but...
but it was long enough.
any one of them could have poisoned the food.
even Alfred himself came in and propositioned her.
do you fancy a smart weekend away sometime?
I'm getting my hands on a nice little bit of cash soon.
no, thank you.
if you change your mind...
watch your head, Mr. Crackenthorpe.
low-flying pigs.
interesting.
perhaps Alfred was the poisoner but his plan backfired
Mr. Eastley left before dinner and wouldn't let Alexander stay behind.
Yes, but he wouldn't benefit Alexander's inheritance would be tied up until he came of age.
Harold's got most to gain.
there's the house as well as his share of the family trust fund.
Harold must be our main suspect now, Miss Marple.
Tom. What?
calamine lotion was a long time ago. My name is Jane.
I'll try.
sorry.
are we sure Anna Stravinska and Martine were... one and the same person?
Anna was French. She had an English husband.
she disappeared at the right time.
then there's that receipt the boys found.
I think it quite possible it was Anna Stravinska in the mausoleum.
but it's not the same as being certain, is it?
I can't stand it here any longer.
don't leave me here, please.
well, come, then.
I'm still not feeling well enough.
don't make a drama out of it!
Dr. Quimper says you're fine now.
that's what he said about Alfred, wasn't it?
please, Harry.
Yes, Mr. Crackenthorpe? Call me Harry.
are you a good comforter, Lucy?
my poor brother.
I have to get on
Yes, we all have to get on, don't we?
that's why I married Alice but some things you just can't...
with one's wife, I mean.
do you see?
you are so unspoiled, my dear.
so lovely.
come on!
stop it! Leave her alone!
get out!
there's something you need to know about Harold.
when Edmund brought his new bride back...
thank you very much.
Harold just couldn't help himself.
he was so jealous of his brother's happiness.
no.
I know what French girls are like. No!
I wasn't sure at the time.
she told me when we met again after Edmund's death.
I'm the only one who knows.
you still haven't told me why you lied.
which train were you on?
which train?
I don't know.
why can't you trust me? I want to.
just try harder, then, can't you?
he didn't say how long he kept in touch with Martine, just that he met her again after Edmund's death?
thank you, Lucy.
Alexander's chum James - what's his surname?
it's a cheat, really. Size of the glove.
easier than cricket by a long chalk.
you might tell me what we're waiting for.
what have you found out?
information Mr. Eastley should have volunteered but didn't, for some reason.
perhaps he lacks confidence in Brackhampton CID.
your chief suspect for murder gets murdered himself under your nose, for a start.
under your nose, to be accurate.
don't start blaming me.
have you questioned Harold again? Why?
isn't it obvious?
he killed Martine stop her telling the rest of the family what he tried to do to her all those years ago.
without Alfred, he inherits the Hall.
I'd keep a round-the-clock guard on Luther.
we don't quite stretch to round-the-clock guards.
I'd feel safer.
had that occurred to you?
you don't have to stay.
I'd have thought you needed all the help you can get.
we may not be the FBI, but we always get our man.
that's the Mounties. Or our woman.
not this one.
I didn't mean that. I hope not.
here they are.
this should make things a little clearer.
martine! What are you doing here?
Bryan.
good afternoon, Mr. Eastley.
we weren't properly introduced, were we?
lady Stoddard-West has kindly agreed to clarify a few matters.
I never ever thought I would set foot here again.
let's go in, Martine.
Bryan and Edith were so kind to me after I lost Edmund
I kept no contact with the rest of the family.
the memories were painful.
but they stayed in touch, and when Edith died, we became even closer.
l moved far away when I married my present husband,
lord Stoddard-Wess
but my son James stays often with Alexander for the holidays.
why didn't you tell me this, Bryan?
I made him promise not to tell anyone about me.
I swore I would never come here again.
but when James told me... I was going to call you, but then with the second murder...
just then Miss Marple telephoned me.
I was not sure, but erm...
when I heard James spoke impeccable French, and you'd met Edmund's widow after his death...
well...I was right.
lady Stoddard-West is alive and well.
luckily.
alfred shut me in there once, when I was six.
I still dream about it, actually.
a psychiatrist might say that made you an unpleasant man
I beg your pardon?
but I'm a policeman.
Martine was here. Martine?
then the body wasn't her.
I know what you did to her.
it's pretty disgusting!
your brother's wife and him about to go off and die for his country.
Yes.
they were so happy, so simply happy, like Mum and Dad.
I've...never been able to like women.
I may be disgusting, but I'm not a murderer.
no.
Harold!
I want you!
we're leaving. Does she know?
no.
take this man home.
inspector.
well, the victim wasn't Martine, so Harold's in the clear.
she must be Anna Stravinska.
but even if we know who she was we don't know who she was, do we?
sorry, do go on.
has Mr. Eastley explained to you where he was on the 4th?
or why he got Emma to cover up for him?
was he on the same train of the victim? Bryan couldn't kill.
even war heroes have been known to go off the rails.
what about Cedric? Have you checked on his alibi?
did he arrive back from lbiza the day after the murder?
I was intending to check his passport stamps.
that's a very sound idea.
thank you, Jane.
though I always think it best not to alert a suspect until one has the strongest basis for one's questions.
hm. Me, too.
3 DEC 1951. IBIZA
you could have come to me.
that's what Emma said.
I'd have understood.
would you?
no.
but I'd try.
I have to now
is that the overseas operator?
how exciting!
Yes, it's a number in Ceylon.
you don't think Uncle Alfred died because I said there's always another murder in books?
no, Alexander, I don't.
well, I expect you two have got heaps to discuss. Goodbye.
my subtle son.
he thinks you need a proper home life.
look, um... the day of the murder.
Yes.
I was in London with the bank manager.
one hell of a mess with school fees and pretty much everything as regards money.
I was going crazy about it all, took my eye off the road, shot a red light and crunched the car.
not serious, but I had to get the train here.
Emma picked me up. I didn't want Alexander getting wind of it
So...which train were you on?
what does your shrink say about your train complex?
l don't recall. I got into Brackhampton just before six.
I'll get you a train timetable for Christmas. Giftwrapped.
Bryan, I'm sorry... It's OK.
you're still special and beautiful.
Oh, and er...
I'm falling in love with you.
but that'll keep.
Yes, Miss Marple?
some more information?
Yes, let me guess.
timetables. Maps.
parallel railway tracks.
am I... No.
you... Don't come in. You don't have to come in.
I hope you won't think this insensitive but I've tickets for Noel Coward's cabaret opening tonight.
there'll be a party. It might take all our minds off things.
how did you get them? I worked for Mr. Coward briefly.
I'm not sure. How many did you get?
six. My aunt, of course, and I asked your father.
but he suggested you invite Dr. Quimper instead.
did he?
well, I could see, I suppose.
I suppose I might as well confess.
confess?
I didn't fly in the day after the murder.
it was the day before.
so you don't have an alibi?
Oh, I do.
I rather overegged my success as an artist.
I haven't sold anything for over two years.
and I'm not very good in the sun.
one can't be pale and interesting in Ibiza.
especially if one's not interesting.
Oh, Cedric, dear!
at the same time that woman was meeting her grisly end,
I was in London, sitting the Civil Service entrance exam.
sadly, though... Don't say it.
you flunked that, too.
Oh, no. Much worse.
a passsed top
I'll be pushing a pen in Whitehall now, instead of...
flourishing a brush in the Balearics.
poor Dad's heartbroken.
congratulations, Miss Crackenthorpe.
mum" was meant to be the word, Miss Marple.
Oh, yes.
david and I are engaged.
good for you.
finally.
how refreshingly patient of you, Doctor.
people do rush into things so, don't they?
did you make those sandwiches, Lucy?
Yes, fish paste.
I hope you went easy on the arsenic.
Oh, David.
don't be so silly, everyone.
scrumptious.
miss Marple?
a fish bone.
let me see.
excuse me.
Whoops. Don't panic. It's all right. Breathe normally.
breathe normally.
Yes! Yes!
that's him. Yes!
that's the killer!
alarm. PULL THE CHAIN PENALTY FOR IMPROPER USE ï¿¡25.
come on, Doctor.
david Quimper,
I'm arresting you for the murder of Alfred Crackenthorpe and of Suzanne Belene, also known as Anna Stravinska...
your wife.
David?
it's not true.
you were married in London on April 10th 1939, at St Luke's Church, Marylebone.
she was trained as a dancer. You had a practice in Camden Town.
you separated before moving to Brackhampton, but she was a Catholic and wouldn't agree to a divorce.
it wasn't patience that kept you from asking Miss Crackenthorpe to marry you.
you had to choose between bigamy and murder.
you silly old woman.
I'd like to seek a second opinion on that, Doctor.
Oh, you brute!
Oh, yes. That is the man I saw from the 4. 50 from Paddington on December 4th, strangling a poor, terrified woman to death!
No!
come on, David.
I did it for us.
budge up.
Elspeth McGillicuddy.
how was your flight? Only for you, Jane.
well, then?
I am so very sorry. I have to know.
I imagine it was money she wanted when she contacted him.
her career was coming to an end, after all.
perhaps she hoped for a reconciliation.
whatever the reason, he made his plans and invited her down to talk things over.
then he pushed her out.
later, knowing the family were inside, remembering Agnes, he took the body to the mausoleum.
he knew it would be discovered eventually, which is why he sent that letter, supposedly from Martine.
suspicion would fall on the family, not him.
why try to give Alfred an alibi, saying he saw him at the King's Head at the time of the murder?
he was really giving himself an alibi.
he knew Alfred would be dead by the time Tom checked up.
you mean it was Alfred he meant to kill when he poisoned us not Dad?
Oh, yes.
he had the greatest respect for both your parents.
he would have waited for you however long your father lived.
why kill Alfred?
I believe Alfred was blackmailing him.
he'd seen something which only made sense later.
he'd seen him plant the receipt he'd written with Martine's name on it a clue for the boys to find, now that the body had been discovered earlier than he had anticipated.
where did you find this? Stuck in the holly bush.
he said he was expecting money when he came into the...
I'm getting my hands on a nice little bit of cash soon.
but Quimper was never in the kitchen.
how did he get the arsenic into the curry?
he didn't. The police laboratory tested it.
he added the arsenic to the sample he took before he gave it to the police.
I'm just going.
it was the cocktail he poisoned with just enough to make everyone unpleasantly ill, so that he could administer the lethal dose to Alfred.
he couldn't have. I was there.
I heard Alfred shouting for him.
you heard Alfred shouting at him.
Quimper.
help me!
doctor Quim...per!
help me!
doctor Quimper! Help!
that's Alfred.
it's of no comfort.
but it was a crime born of love.
it's only love that matters.
have you booked your flight back?
I'll not bother. It's all a bit sticky.
Oh. How was Roddy? Thriving.
I met his new lady friend. She was a decent sort.
there's a girl who's spoilt for choice.
there's a girl who travels alone.
I'll take your bags.
no need. I can manage that, Mr. Eastley.
alexander said you needed looking after.
I guess I do.
then I...
I hope you find someone, Bryan.
truly.
but I'm not always right.
happy Christmas. Happy Christmas.
Jane. Tom.

morning, Johnnie. Morning.
morning, Johnnie. Anything for me? Just the one today.
thank you.
dear Mother, I have been missing you terribly...
Mrs. Dyas is selling a Sheraton sideboard.
second-hand motor mower for sale.
who'll be able to afford the petrol for one of those?
can you not suck your teeth, Mother?
it's not attractive.
well, all this lovely detail.
who's having to sell the furniture?
who's receiving a bequest?
little cryptic notes between lovers.
and the correspondence page is full of all the petty feuds and squabbles of village life.
we quite obviously haven't finished, Mrs Finch.
go back into your room.
you've got to be more polite, Edmund.
if Mrs Finch takes a dislike to me, she simply won't come.
sorry, Mrs Swettenham.
I wouldn't read that this morning, Tarquin.
they don't know the first thing about India.
probably never been there.
right.
do we need a new sideboard?
eh? No.
and we don't want a motor mower, either.
Hinch...
Hinch!
henhouse.
Hinch! Where are you?
henhouse!
listen to this.
Tarquin.
tarquin, listen to this.
a murder is announced.
a murder is announced and will take place...
a murder is announced and will take place on Friday, September 25th.
a marriage is announced and will take place on Friday, September 25th at Little Paddocks at 7.30pm. A what?
a marriage.
a murder. A murder!
and it's today. This is even more exciting.
friends please accept this the only intimation.
what do you think it means?
it means going round to Letitia Blacklock's and having bad sherry that's what it means.
then having to pretend to murder one of the neighbours.
and will the lights suddenly go out?
that's usually the form. Will there be screaming?
well, if you've got anything to do with it, yes, I expect so.
now Will you please go insideï¼
you've got your bedroom slippers on.
it seems a strange thing for Miss Blacklock to doï¼
don't you think?
a strange way to invite everyone.
she's normally so proper. And kind.
not at all frivolous.
Patrick, was this your idea?
no, indeed, Aunt Letty.
why should I know anything about it?
I thought it might be your idea of a joke.
nothing of the kind.
like when you put the hedgehog in Mitzi's bed.
I was only trying to cheer her up.
like this morning, you try to cheer me up when you tell me I can't boil an egg.
you do good work, Finch.
in my own country, I was at university. I was to be lawyer.
Julia. Of course not, Aunt Letty.
do you think...Mrs Haymes...?
I don't think Phillipa would try and be funny.
she hasn't smiled since Goebbels poisoned his children.
I suppose it's some sort of silly hoax. But why?
what's the point of it?
it seems a very stupid sort of joke, and in very bad taste.
don't work yourself up over it, Bunny.
you'll get one of your migraines.
it's just somebody's idea of humour.
it says today. Today at seven thirty.
what do you think's going to happen?
death. Delicious Death. Do be quiet, Patrick.
it's about the special cake Mitzi make.
you know, we always call it Delicious Death.
letty?
well, I know one thing that's going to happen, and that's, at seven thirty we'll have half the village up here agog with curiosity.
especially the old fogies. They love a good murder.
good morning. Madam.
excuse me.
Yes, madam?
may I change my last water treatment tomorrow morning from ten o'clock to eight thirty, as I'm hoping to catch the ten o'clock train.
I'm sure that won't be a problem.
have you enjoyed your staying here?
I have. Yes.
do you feel, erm...
Remunerated?
not in the slightest. But I do feel rejuvenated.
Yes, of course.
is there anything else I can do for you?
order tea for the lounge, cash a cheque, find you a newspaper?
may I have a pot of tea sent up to my room, please?
right away. Thank you.
you're worried, aren't you, Lotty? Dora, don't.
I'm sorry.
I've told you. But even if the notice was a joke, it seems to me there's...
there's spite in this joke.
it's not a very nice kind of joke.
maybe it is me they want to kill.
the Nazis.
or perhaps, this time, the Bolsheviks.
they find out I'm here.
these people have come around to my house before.
my dear child, if anyone wanted to murder you, they'd hardly advertise the fact in the paper, would they?
perhaps it is you they mean to murder, Miss Blacklock.
nonsense. Now, help me carry these things through, please.
after that, clean the silver in the dining room.
that will keep you out of the way if any fun should happen
you've had the central heating lit.
Yes, it's been so clammy and damp lately.
I got Evans to light it before he left.
the precious precious coke?
otherwise it would be even more precious coal.
I suppose there was once heaps of coke and coal for everyoody
Yes. And cheap, too.
now, Julia, can you and your brother move the table and the sherry tray round the corner into the other room?
after all, I'm not giving a party. I haven't invited anyone.
is there a party? No-one told me.
of course, Phillipa doesn't know.
the only woman in Chipping Cleghorn who doesn't.
Where's the paper? Has anybody seen it?
are you sitting on it? No.
I must go and shut up the ducks. They should be in by now.
I'll do it, Aunt Letty.
no, you won't. Tell Phillipa about the thing.
the last time someone offered to do it, they didn't latch the door properly.
where is it? On the other page.
Oh, yes. Look. Here.
evidently, there's going to be a murder.
here.
thank you.
seventeen POUNDS ONLY
excuse me.
may I see the manager, please?
Colonel Easterbrook.
good evening. Good evening.
good evening. Good evening.
I was just passing and I saw you had your central heating on.
well spotted, Colonel.Yes, it is.
and lovely, lovely chrysanthemums. And fresh violets.
thank you.
thank you, Mitzi.
Mrs Swettenham and her son, whose name I have completely forgotten. Edmund.
good evening, Miss Blacklock. Good evening.
you've got your central heating on.
Yes, they have. Have you started yours yet?
no. Neither have I.
sherry? Not yet.
Oh...that'll be somebody else.
do you think they'll have something to say about the central heating?
sorry.
anyone dead yet?
we were so worried we were going to miss it.
this is so exciting. Thank you.
none of you will know this, but before the war, there used to be lots of this sort of thing going on in the village.
one winter, my mother got murdered five times!
I've never been so thrilled.
I need a drink.
are you all right, Bunny? When's it going to start?
if it's going to happen, it's going to happen soon.
what do you mean, "If"?
well, I'm as much in the dark as you are.
Oh, it's beginning!
Edmund, where are you? Here, Mother.
Stick'em up!
Stick'em up, I tell you.
the lights! Who's near the switch?
that was a real gun. The lights!
Oh, my God.
Letty. Oh, my goodness.
get a doctor or something.
blood everywhere. Oh, Letty, it's only a flesh wound.
sit down. Sit down. I'm fine.
somebody get the lights on!
there's somebody out here.
idiot. People like that...
get up. Get up, I say.
Colonel! Tell him to get to his feet.
the fool!
he can't.
he's dead.
what?
he's been shot.
who is he?
hotel Employee Killed Attempting Robbery
inspector Craddock, Middleshire Police.
may I see the manager, please? Certainly, sir.
my dear boy!
are you all right? Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
all in the line of duty. Have you hurt your leg?
no. Thank you.
poor thing. Walk up and down. Try and walk it off.
no.
have you come to investigate the death of Rudi Scherz?
I'm here on police business.
I spoke to him only yesterday.
Swiss. I think.
don't forget to interview his young lady.
she's a waitress in the grill.
if you'd like to come this way, Inspector.
he'd been with us a little over three months.
quite good credentials.
references from good hotels in Switzerland.
all the right permits, et cetera. What exactly did he do?
well, as an idea, it wasn't without originality.
he got a lot of the locals curious got them in a room at the same time and then tried to relieve them of their valuables.
was it suicide or accidental?
don't know. Nothing to indicate either.
the gun went off as he fell.
did you find his work here satisfactory?
well, yes. I did, yes.
but there's someone I'd like you to meet who has something to say that might be of interest in this matter.
one moment. Take a seat.
inspector Craddock, this is Miss Jane Marple, who's been staying with us for two weeks.
and it's been a treat, it really has.
my nephew, Raymond, paid for it, Inspector.
my birthday is in July...
what is it?
it is a cheque. Rudi Scherz altered it.
please sit down, Miss Marple. I have it here.
it came yesterday, with my others from the bank, you see. It was for seven pounds and he altered it to 17.
very nicely done.
a certain amount of practice, I should say.
how can you be sure it's not your mistake?
it's the same ink.
it's the same ink because I wrote it at the desk.
and Inspector, a busy young mother or a girl who's having a love affair is the type who writes cheques of also different kinds, not an old lady who has formed habits.
for personal expenditure, I cash seven.
it used to be five, but everything has gone up so.
I'm afraid I was quite the wrong person to pick.
mr Scherz wouldn't have gone very far in crime.
which brings me to a thought...
thank you, Miss Marple. Thank you.
I have little time and a great many people I need to see before I leave.
like his young lady? Hm.
good. Because he may have told her who it was.
who what was? Oh, I express myself so badly.
who it was who put him up to it.
you think someone put him up to it?
well, he's a personable young man, who filches a bit here and there, sorts of petty theft, so he can dress well and take a girl about and then, suddenly, he goes off, with a revolver, holds up a room full of people and shoots at someone.
he'd never have done a thing like that.
it doesn't make sense.
he wasn't that kind of person.
well, perhaps we don't need to interview the waitress, Miss Marple.
perhaps you'll just tell us exactly what happened.
how can I do that?
there was an account in the paper, but it says so little.
one can make conjecture, but, oh, one has no accurate information.
I'll let you get on. Gentlemen.
well, at least that's her out of the way.
to the station, madam?
no. Chipping Cleghorn, please.
aunt Jane!
Hello, dear. How lovely to see you again !
I do apologise. It's at such short notice.
no. As I said on the telephone, it's delightful to hear from you.
all these promises on Christmas cards, at last one of us has managed to visit.
you look like your mother.
let me help you.
we've had a terrible tragedy in the village, Aunt Jane.
yesterday a man shot himself dead while trying to hold half the village up.
Oh... Well, the last thing you need at a time like this is a visitor.
I can easy go. Nonsense!
it's lovely to see you.
it'll be lovely to have an old friend around.
it was just the one circuit that went.
the drawing room and hall.
he couldn't have tampered with the fuse box, because that's out by the scullery and the maid would have seen him.
unless she's in it with him, of course, which is very possible.
why is it very possible? Well, they're both foreign.
who fixed it afterwards?
er...
Patrick Simmons.
he lives here. Some sort of relative.
have we found out how Scherz got in?
front door, I think. It's not locked till late.
he appears to have gotten here about seven o'clock on the bus from Meddenham.
that would tally with what his girlfriend said.
although she's hardly his girlfriend. She barely knew him.
this lot knew him.
it wasn't the first time he'd been here.
so, where had you met him before?
well, Sergeant, about three weeks ago,
Dora Bunner, who helps me round the house, and I, were having lunch at Meddenham Wells.
miss Blacklock, I know you from Switzerland.
I...I don't think I'm... Yes, it's definitely you.
I'm the son of the proprietor of the Hotel Des Alpes at Montreux.
I remember you and your sister very well.
Charlotte and I had spent a year at that hotel during the war.
it was there that my sister died.
did you remember Mr Scherz?
I had no recollection of seeing him before.
these boys behind reception desks all look the same.
but I was civil to him.
I entered into conversation with him.
you see, his father had been very obliging when my sister became ill.
but ten days ago, he turned up here.
he wanted money.
he said Letty was the only person he knew in England and that he needed to return home as his mother was very poorly.
but you didn't give him any, did you, Letty?
in case you think I'm hard-hearted, Inspector.
I was a secretary for many years to a big financier and one becomes wary of appeals for money.
I know all the hard-luck stories there are.
what surprised me, though, was that he gave in so easily, as though he never expected to get the money.
but he stole the meat. That was the day Mitzi had the good lamb stolen from the cold shelf.
it was he who took it.
he didn't go through to the kitchen, Bunny.
how could he have stolen it?
do you think coming here was a pretext to spy out the land?
Yes. In retrospect.
let me take those dead violets.
I'm sorry.
but you should have been here last night.
tables went flying. People barging about in the dark.
and someone put a cigarette down and burnt one of the best bits of furniture.
well, it all seems clear, sir.
the front door was open.
he'd already seen places in the hall where he could hide, cupboards and so on...and...
no, no. It's not clear, at all.
why should anyone go to all that trouble to burgle this house?
the most you could get out of us was costume jewellery and a couple of pounds.
he wanted to kill you, Latte, for not giving him that money.
Dora, don't get so upset.
the lights went out with a sort of crackling sound.
he found you with his torch and tried to shoot you.
and when he missed, he shot himself.
I'm certain that's the way it was.
I'm certain of it.
he shouted, "Stick'em up, please!
he did not say "please."
do you think the shots were fired blindly or aimed carefully at one particular person?
blindly. No, no, no. They were aimed at Letty.
Oh, Aunt Jane, it was so exciting.
but then it went quiet and the door closed by itself, it does, you know, with a whining noise, quite uncanny.
and there was blood dripping from...
that's quite enough, Amy.
I'm sure Miss Marple doesn't want to get all the gory details? Or she'll never sleep again.
sorry. It's all right.
Colonel Easterbrook has asked us over for lunch.
I do hope you'll come.
I think he wants to really pick over the carcass of last night.
imagery, Amy! Sorry!
there's a spare towel in the airing cupboard.
thank you, dear.
who is she?
she's an old friend of my mother's.
they drove ambulances together in the first war and always wrote.
well, I don't like her being here.
it's going to be fine.
we call her "Aunt Letty."
she's a distant cousin, really.
our mother is Letty's second cousin.
my brother was in the Navy during the war, and I was at one of the ministries based near Llandudno.
when the war was over my mother wrote and asked if we could come and stay.
as paying guests.
it suits us both very well.
I'm at the university in Middlehurst and Julia's training as a dispenser at the hospital 50 minutes away.
can you tell me about last night, Miss Simmons?
why are you wasting our time with this?
it was hardly a suspicious death, was it?
it was obviously an accident.
can you tell me where you were standing when the lights went out, just so I can get a picture?
well, I was on my guard.
next to Miss Hinchcliffe, who'd taken up a manly stance by the fireplace.
most of us were watching the clock as it chimed.
Mr. Simmons?
I was in the back getting the sherry.
I think Colonel Easterbrook had followed.
I don't know.
and Aunt Letty was getting the cigarettes.
did Miss Blacklock have to go to hospital?
no. It just caught her ear.
but, oh, there was so much blood!
and a pound of sausages, please.
there always is with ears.
Yes. I can remember when I was a child, fainting at the hairdresser's.
the man had just snipped my ear, but...
all at once there was this basin of blood.
all right, dear?
well, I can't give you the usual horse meat, can I?
I thought we'd have a little treat.
Oh, lovely.
there you are.
vegetable Marrows.
Congratulations. Thank you.
it's always been my intention that you should have some of them.
they're not quite ready, but they'll taste all right.
let me trade. No, no, no, no.
no, I was always planning to give you some.
they're a present.
thank you.
Mrs. Haymes?
there's an old gardener living in the cottage here, so Mrs Lucas asked me if I would billet at Little Paddocks.
when was this?
at the start of the school year.
I have an eight-year-old son boarding at Meddenham Wells, Inspector.
is there a Mr. Haymes?
he's dead.
he was killed at Monte Cassino.
I'm sorry.
can you tell me in your own words, Mrs Haymes, exactly what happened After you arrived home yesterday evening?
here we are. Very nice.
I'll give him a knock.
well, he said he'd be in, so...
Colonel!
Colonel!
put a stop to this now, do you understand?
or I call the police. It stops here.
miss Murgatroyd.
everything all right?
Yes. Yes.
we were just meeting to go over the events of last night. Edmund?
see if we could come up with something to help the police with this suicide.
sorry, I don't know your name.
Oh, Jane Marple, this is Colonel Easterbrook and Edmund Swettenham.
pleased to meet you. How do you do?
how do you do?
are you sure it was suicide, Colonel?
Yes. Where would he get a Luger like that?
half the soldiers who came back from Europe seemed to have a German gun in their knapsack.
Mr. Swettenham, guns like that are often impossible to trace.
it definitely wasn't suicide. It was an accident.
no, no
you've got to know your criminal.
you've got to use psychology.
now, why does this fellow put an advert in the newspaper?
he wants to advertise himself.
Why? What's he selling?
himself.
he feels despised, as a foreigner, at the hotel, passed over by this Englishwoman who wouldn't give him money.
what is the idol of the cinema nowadays? Hm?
the gangster! The tough guy.
I thought it was Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.
so, he dresses himself up, shoots his gun, to frighten Letitia in front of her friends, maybe with the intention of robbery, but then...
then he sees he's shot her.
perhaps killed her.
I see. Yes.
it's all up with him, and in a blind panic, he turns the pistol on himself.
you see? Psychology.
come on, girls.
has Dora Banner always lived with Miss Blacklock?
Oh, no. She's an old friend of Letitia's. When was it?
six months ago.
Yes. Six months ago, she wrote her a letter.
her health had given way. She was living in one room trying existing on a pension.
Letty, being Letty, smooth down, and gives her a place to live.
did you know that pigs are the closest animals to men?
did you know that, Miss Marple? No.
we've named all of ours after generals in the British Army.
Yes. There's Wellington.
Haig. There's Monty.
and there's Inspector Craddock.
you're the lady from the hotel.
nice to meet you again, Inspector.
what are you doing here in chicken peg run?
Oh, Miss Marple's an old friend of the family.
she's staying for a few days.
and when did she arrange this little trip?
well, this morning.
sergeant, would you accompany Miss Hinchcliffe and Miss Murgatroyd inside, please?
come along, please.
may I have a word? Of course.
I must emphasise, in the strongest terms, that I hope your visit here is a genuine one and you are not concerning yourself in police business.
of course, Inspector.
I'm glad that's clear.
but I must admit, it's been fascinating, listening to what people saw or thought they saw last night.
haven't you found that? Not... No.
because, in reality, they couldn't actually have seen anything, could they?
go on.
if I understand correctly there wasn't any light in the hall at Miss Blacklock's and not on the landing, either.
that's right.
so, if a man stood in the doorway and flashed a powerful torch, nobody could see anything but the torch, could they?
so, everything they saw they are really recapitulating from what they saw afterwards when the lights came on.
and this all fits in well, I think, with the assumption that Rudi Scherz was the erm...
isn't "fall guy "the expression Dashiel Hammett uses?
are you suggesting he was persuaded by someone to go out and take pot shots at a room full of people?
I think he was told it was a joke.
he was paid for doing it, of course.
paid for... I presume it was he who put the advert in the paper?
paid for going up and spying on the house and paid for throwing open the door shining a torch and shouting.
but...
he never had a gun.
but everyone says... No. They didn't see it, did they?
they heard. If he had a lamp in one hand and a door that swung shut in the other, he had no hands left to hold a gun.
I think...somebody came up behind him in the darkness.
and fired those two shots over his shoulder
it terrified him to death. He swung round and as he did so that other person shot him
and let the revolver drop beside him
but who would do that?
you'll have to find out from Miss Blacklock who wanted to kill her.
and if you find that out, you'll find out who killed Rudi Scherz.
go.
go back to bed.
SSH, ssh.
his face.
that poor...that poor man.
that poor...
the blood on his face
I'm scared, Bunny. I know.
I'm scared.
but thank God it wasn't you. It wasn't you.
now, sh, sh.
I'm going to go and make a cup of tea.
Sshh...
Oh... Don't do that, you'll give me a heart attack.
quinces. We've had a harvest and we've got far too many.
I don't want anything in return.
are you coming to church?
I mustn't be seen with you.
we talked about this and...
no. No, don't want to see you now
no.
what?
ever?
what's he said to you? Please.
please.
good morning. Morning.
morning, Miss Marple. Good morning.
do you know if Colonel Easterbrook is coming to church this morning?
erm... I believe he's ill, I'm afraid.
Oh. I'm so sorry.
this... This, erm, murder at...
miss Blacklock's, it's...preying on his mind.
if you'll excuse me.
you'd have thought, having been a soldier, he'd be the last person to let it prey on his mind.
how long have the Swettenhams been in the village?
a year. They arrived just before Archie Easterbrook.
Oh.
Insepctor, I have some information for you.
can I talk to you later, Miss Kosinski?
Yes. Yes, of course. I will know nothing, will I, Inspector?
I will not be able to tell you who I heard talking in the summerhouse with that dead boy the same day he came begging for money.
who?
Mrs Haymes.
you're sure it was Rudi Scherz that Phillipa Haymes was talking to?
I do not lie.
I see him leave and cross
and when I go outside I hear them talk
and I think, "So, this is how you behave, my fine lady.
but now I realise it was not love Phillipa Haymes planned with him.
it was to rob and murder Miss Blacklock, who has been so kind to her.
but, of course, you think I lie.
no. Yes.
you people!
you all think I lie.
miss Blacklock will be down in a minute.
Oh!
bunny, should we wait or should we walk on?
Oh, walk on.
walk on. Fine.
walk on.
what's this door, Miss Bunner?
Oh, I try and open it three times a week!
it's the dummy to the sitting room.
it was fastened when the two rooms were thrown into one.
nailed up or just locked?
Oh, locked and bolted. It hasn't been opened for years.
has it, Letty? Even though you keep trying.
did it used to have a table against it?
the hall table, yes. When was it moved?
Oh, recently.
about ten days or a fortnight ago.
Dora, dear, it's best you go.
we don't know how long the police will be.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry.
I'll walk slowly.
why was it moved?
I think Phillipa did a big vase of flowers and they were, well, they were really beautiful.
full of September colours.
but far too big for there so she moved them here.
is there a key? Yes.
Yes, there are keys in here.
it will be one of these, I shouldn't wonder.
let's see.
Ah, yes. It will be one of these.
thank you very much.
the hinges have been oiled.
Mm.
this door's not sealed.
it's been opened. Recently.
but why?
because I believe the person that tried to kill you...
was inside the room when the lights went out.
and this is how they got out behind Rudi Scherz.
not much longer.
just these few days.
but I'm not worth murdering, Inspector
at least, not yet.
what do you mean?
simply that, one day, I may be a very rich woman.
possibly quite soon.
but until then, I exist on a small annuity and my lodgers.
what money I had went the way of all German and Italian securities during the war.
then how will you come into money?
do you remember Randall Goedler, the financier?
by name, yes.
the millionaire?
several times over.
I was his secretary for over 20 years.
he died without children and left his fortune in trust to his wife and after her death to me.
the last ten years or so
I've had an excellent motive for murdering Mrs Goedler.
but that doesn't help you, does it, Inspector?
forgive me asking this, but did Mrs Goedler resent her husband leaving you his money?
I know what you're thinking, Inspector, but I was not Randall's mistress.
he was in love with Belle and remained so until he died.
no, I think it was...
it was gratitude on his part that prompted his will.
you see, in the early years, when Randall was still on an insecure footing, I...
well, I lent him a little money, which saved him from financial disaster.
after that, he treated me like his junior partner.
Oh, they were exciting days.
I only gave it up when my father died.
my sister was an invalid and I had to look after her.
I took her for treatment in Switzerland just before the war, where she eventually died.
I only arrived back in England 18 months or so ago.
how soon might you become a rich woman?
belle Goedler lives in Scotland.
she's a sweet woman. I haven't seen her for years, but we write Christmas and birthdays
she's also very sick. It may only be a few weeks
what happens to the money if you die before Mrs Goedler?
do you know I never thought.
I suppose it would go to the offspring of Randall's only sister Sonia.
Randall quarrelled with her, after she married a man he considered a crook.
what was his name now? He was very handsome, but a drunk.
and predatory around young women.
Fabricant! Alex Fabricant.
Randall Goedler cut his sister out of the will when she married?
they never spoke again. But there were children?
I think so. All I heard was that
sonia Fabricant as she became, wrote once after she married, to say that she'd given birth to twins and she was going to call them Pip and Emma.
how old would this brother and sister be?
I really don't know if Pip and Emma exist.
might I have a word please, Mrs Haymes?
I was told you had conversation with Rudi Scherz days before the hold-up.
who said that?
you were overheard in the summerhouse at Little Paddocks...
this is nonsense.
please remain in the car, Mrs Haymes.
who on earth told you this?
just answer the question.
it was Mitzi, wasn't it?
it sounds like Mitzi, who is a liar.
if you haven't worked that out by now, Inspector, you really ought to consider another profession.
sorry. And you should obviously not be considering another profession.
but Mitzi does make things up, if it's not a leg of lamb being stolen then it's something like this.
right.
right.
goodbye.
I'll find out for you, when you're in Scotland.
what?
if people are who they say they are.
because that's what's worrying you, isn't it?
and that's really the particular way in which this world has changed since the war.
in a place like this, everyone knew who each other was and if somebody new came, they brought letters of introduction.
now the country is like the town and all you know about your neighbour is what they say of themselves.
anybody who took the trouble could have a suitable identity card.
the only people who could oil that door would be those who lived with Miss Blacklock.
not necessarily. Haven't you noticed how no-one locks their door here?
and the little market of illegal bartering going on gives any neighbour an excuse to drop by.
all they would need to know is Mitzi's afternoon off and the times Miss Blacklock and Miss Bunner go out.
it would be as easy as...
stealing Mitzi's leg of lamb from the larder.
the lamb's not important, is it?
we don't know yet.
all we know is that if Miss Blacklock dies, there are at least two people in this world who would come into a large fortune.
but Pip and Emma may not exist.
or they may even be respectable citizens living somewhere in Europe.
or...
one or both of them may be in Chipping Cleghorn.
maybe even with one or other of their parents.
but if Sonia or Alex Fabricant were in the village, then surely Miss Blacklock would have recognised them.
people can change their appearance, inspector.
she would have known the Fabricants a long time ago.
try and get a photograph of them from Mrs Goedler.
and get your sergeant to trace everyone through the official records.
I will do what I can here.
if there's going to be another murder attempt, it'll happen quickly, before Mrs Goedler dies.
then hurry back.
Middleshire POLICE. STATEMENT OF WITNESS
the BLUE CAFE
I was so interested to hear that you were at school with the Miss Blacklocks.
mm, yes. Both of them.
yours is indeed an old friendship. Oh, yes, indeed.
very few people would be as loyal to their old friends as Lotty.
those days seem so long ago.
such a pretty girl, enjoyed life so much.
Oh, thank you.
Yes.
it all seemed so sad.
what was sad?
sad affliction, bravely borne.
I always think of that verse.
such courage and patience and it ought to be rewarded that's what I say.
money can do a lot to ease one's path in life.
money! Oh, no, Miss Marple, money is not the answer.
people will...
people take advantage of her, that's what they do.
some people...
I won't name names, but...
well, some people, like Patrick Simmons, they take advantage.
twice, to my knowledge, he has got money out of Lotty and twice he's run up a debt.
no, she is too trusting at times.
you and I know the world, Miss Marple we would not be as trusting, and, if you ask me, that Patrick knew that Swiss boy, that's what I think.
what makes you think that? Money.
and I think he fiddled with that lamp in the dining room, to make the lights go out, because I distinctly remember it was the shepherdess, not the shepherd and the next day...
good morning, Miss Marple, getting cold outside, isn't it?
good morning.
I haven't ordered for you, but I can order again.
have you been shopping?
excuse me. Someone's birthday.
may I have... Excuse me!
I think we should get Mitzi to bake a cake, don't you?
Oh, Miss Marple, you must come back with us.
Phillipa has done the most wonderful flower arrangement for me.
you must see it.
I had planned to meet Amy.
Amy can come, too. Oh, everyone must see it.
it's just marvellous!
Hello, is that the War Office? This is Middleshire Police.
I'd like to check the service record of a number of people, please.
Archie Easterbrook Patrick Simmons
thank you.
she said she used soothing colours to try and bring some calm to the house after all the trouble.
Oh, of course. She's so clever.
it must have been a terrible shock, Miss Blacklock.
do the police know how Mr Scherz broke in?
he walked in.
or was assisted. They've realised that the second door, the one that leads to the back of the room, well, that door.
Dora, I don't think the Inspector wants that talked about.
Oh, no, Lotty. I'm sorry.
well, we won't breathe a word.
is, erm, that where you were standing?
Yes, she was.
she had the vase of violets in her hand when the lights went out.
no, the cigarette box.
I was about to offer my guests cigarettes.
Oh, yes, you were.
well, if you'll excuse me, we seem to have run out of milk.
so that must be the Dresden shepherd lamp and what a beautiful table.
well, it was, but it's been ruined with a cigarette burn.
I mean, I know it was very frightening when he burst in, but, well, people should take more care with their cigarettes.
where did Phillipa find such late roses? Was it Dyas Hall?
no, no, in the garden. I'll show you.
Oh, yes.
excuse us.
Oh, I'm sorry. I came in search of the second Dresden lamp.
Dora said it was in here. Dora said it's wonderful.
Yes, it must be here somewhere.
a shepherdess, erm...
I'm disturbing you.
no, I was just thinking about Mitzi and what she must have gone through in Poland.
I wonder what's worse thinking you might die at any time in the war or thinking you might die at any time now.
because of a deliberate act.
well, this lamp must be here somewhere.
let's try the hall.
I've had those lamps for years.
Yes, and when you've had possessions a long time they get so full of memories, don't you think?
they're almost better than photographs.
which is another thing people don't do nowadays.
they put very few photographs around.
we'll have to ask Dora.
I have a lovely one of Amy, aged three holding a cat and squinting.
I expect you have many of your cousins and other relations.
not Julia and Patrick, no. In truth
I'd forgotten what my cousin's children were called, actually.
Oh! Or how many she had, until she wrote and asked me if they could stay.
I'd hoped the flowers would cheer you up.
at least persuade you to put your wig on.
we don't need that man, Mother, not you and me.
what else would he bring but unhappiness?
you don't know him at all.
I know enough to know that.
OK, you can cook another cosy Sunday roast for him, go for walks, play happy families.
but he's a drinker, and he'll always drink.
you know he'll always drink.
Oh, no, we're not getting dressed up for Bunny's party, are we?
well, I just thought we should make an effort.
Edmund Swettenham left a jar of honey for me in the hall this afternoon along with a card.
I don't know how he knew it was my birthday.
people are so kind.
Oh, no!
they'll look gorgeous.
you must look nice for your party tonight.
everyone wants to make a fuss of you.
Oh, thank you.
you're not royalty or anything else dubious are you, Miss Marple?
no.
it's just with Amy inviting half the village round for dinner it's as if you're on a state visit.
no, I live in a village much like this.
lucky you. I don't know why people live in places like this.
unless they're like Easterbrook.
there's too many ghosts in London from India.
at least, that's what he's told my mother.
evidently he has a daughter there, but she gave up on him some time ago.
is that why he doesn't keep any mementos of India round the house?
probably. Too much past.
it's unusual. Most former officers fill their homes with trophies and photographs and guns.
all of which have interminable stories behind them.
Does...London hold too much past for your mother as well, my dear?
Why? What have people said, Miss Marple?
nothing, I was...just wondering from what you just said.
good evening. How are you? Very well. Thanks.
I'm sorry. It's just that gossip's like acid in a place like this.
it's so corrosive. Hm.
# Happy birthday to you. #
# Happy birthday to you. #
# Happy birthday, dear Bunny. #
# Happy birthday to you #
hip, hip... Hooray!
delicious Death!
come on, Bunny.
one, two... Hang on, hang on.
Patrick!
three!
well done! Many happy returns of the day.
Mrs Goedler's strongest times are in the morning and after supper.
then she will talk, and enjoy talking, but, quite suddenly, her energy will go and she will drop.
she is, you see, kept almost entirely under the influence of morphia.
have you any old photographs, Mrs Goedler, especially of Sonia Fabricant and her family?
I believe she had at least two children.
no, I'm afraid there's nothing like that.
all our...personal papers and things were stored... with the furniture from the London house at the beginning of the war...
and then the storage depository was blitzed.
did you ever meet Sonia Fabricant's children?
no.
Alex Fabricant was a crook.
a real crook.
he had a criminal record.
Randall would have nothing to do with him.
nevertheless, he left his estate to Sonia's children, if Miss Blacklock predeceased you.
that was me.
Randall wouldn't countenance that man getting his paws on the money, so he agreed to Pip and Emma.
but who knows where they are? They may be dead.
or maybe not. Here's a brother and sister brought up somewhere in Europe.
their father's a criminal.
whatever happened to them during the war, maybe they turned up in England.
looked up their uncle's will to see what money was left in the family and if they... Don't let them hurt Blackie!
no.
Blackie's good. Really good.
you mustn't let them hurt her.
all right, all right. Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh.
calm yourself.
the police say the dummy door's been oiled? Yes.
then they must think the scheme was...
lights out.
yes? The wretched thing, the...
the hinges, the wood. The door?
the door opens with a flourish.
the Swiss fellow comes in with his torch.
yes? And then one of us sneaks out behind and while the rest of us are ogling the light this one of us...has the gun.
that's impossible.
so...
one of us shoots Letitia Blacklock?
Yes.
that's what the police must be thinking.
well, let's, er...
let's find out, huh?
let's find out now. Let's re-enact it!
I think we should all call it a night, don't you, Colonel?
get off me!
we could be finding out. All of us.
do you think this is a good idea?
well, I'm game, as long as he stops shouting.
come on. We'll do it here, in front of the window.
can I be Professor Plum?
just stand where you were standing when the lights went out!
I feel sick after that cake.
I haven't had anything that rich in years.
are you on the sauce, Bunny?
we've run out of aspirin, Lotty.
have you got a migraine?
Yes. I think I might retire early, if that's all right.
there's some more by my bed. Thank you.
it's the excitement. Mm.
asprin Tablets.
then I was definitely here.
no, you weren't.
where exactly were you, then, Colonel?
I was here, by Letitia.
this must be very boring for you. I'm sorry, Aunt Jane.
well, she can play the Swiss boy!
Yes, yes! Look why don't you come bursting through the door like a lunatic and then hurl yourself into a heap on the floor?
because those sort of days are behind me, Colonel.
Colonel Easterbrook, you really should drink more often!
where were you, Miss Murgatroyd?
I was over here, by the door
Yes, yes. Yes, you were! You were! Thank you.
and if you were there...
you would have been behind the light.
you wouldn't have been blinded by the torch.
yes?
Archie... Please, please, be quiet!
she could see us all, as the torch lit up the room.
she could see...
who wasn't there!
is that true? Amy, who wasn't there?
I don't... I can't remember.
Oh, come on, Amy, the door crashes open...
Stick'em up!
no.
you watched the light as it scanned across the room.
Stick'em up!
no, I had my eyes closed. Surely you peeked, you silly, sybaritic...thing!
Oh, don't be so pathetic!
you must have seen something!
No! I can't remember things. No.
would anyone like a cup of tea?
Yes. Yes, I'll make it.
Phillipa, may I have a word?
Yes, of course.
I er... I know you get anxious about your boy's education, that you worry about the future and that's why I want to tell you something.
things haven't been very settled lately, and I thought I would like to make a new will, in view of certain eventualities.
apart from Bunny's legacy what little there is going to you.
but I don't want it, really, I don't. Why me?
I'm thinking of your child.
I want to do this.
you're a dark horse.
did you hear that?
I think I was rather meant to, don't you?
but remember, if she's knocked off now, you're the number one suspect.
no. No, because the woman in Scotland is still alive...
so you know about Belle Goedler! You know all about that.
sure you don't want me to walk you home? Quite sure.
then I'm going for a quick drink.
Archie? Archie!
it was my gun.
it was my gun used to kill that boy.
what, the one in your desk?
someone's taken it.
I don't know what to do.
it is...
someone we know.
do you know who it is?
why haven't you been to the police?
because I have no licence...
and I don't...
I don't want the police digging over the trouble.
Oh, my love, it's all right.
No!
No! Come home to mine, hm? Come on !
up!
Sadie...
come on.
did you get some sleep on the train?
well, this will wake you up.
now, Patrick and Julia Simmons are who they say they are.
his naval record is genuine. Their mother confirmed that they are staying with Letitia Blacklock.
so they're not Pip and Emma. No.
Mrs Haymes? Oh, there's a lot about her.
it's all in there, but even more exciting is Colonel Easterbrook.
now, he was in India, all right, but he got drummed out of his regiment for drinking.
the final straw being when he took a shot at a fellow officer during a drunken brawl.
and he's the right age for Alex Fabricant.
does he have a family? I was tracing them and his record before the war, when we had a visitor.
he says he has proof that Easterbrook killed Rudi Scherz.
who is that for, Mitzi?
miss Bunner hasn't come down this morning.
I'll take it.
Dora Dora?
Oh, Bunny!
I need you to go through with it. Just don't abandon me now!
but she's dead! Patrick!
miss Blacklock, we are so very sorry to hear about Dora's death.
miss Hinchcliffe asked if I would leave these flowers.
I'm...
only a...stranger, I know, but...
miss Bunner seemed to me the nicest...
she was... She was the only link with the past.
I know. The only one who remembered.
and now...
and now she's gone.
is it yours, Colonel?
we know it's yours. Because you showed Edmund Swettenham it in your drawer two weeks ago.
he said you tried to impress him with some fanciful story about how you captured it
it's mine.
but I did not try and kill Letitia Blacklock.
I didn't know it was missing...
until I saw it lying there, next to the Swiss boy.
well, if you had nothing to hide, why didn't you come forward your first opportunity and tell us that the gun was yours?
no licence.
is this your daughter?
Yes.
miss Laura Easterbrook. Where is she now?
she lives in London, I think.
we are not in contact.
we are not in contact.
her mother divorced me because of the drink.
I have not seen Laura for ten years.
that is the truth.
Dora Bunner was found murdered this morning, having taken poison that had been meant for Miss Blacklock.
it was definitely poison.
she died within seconds.
this Easterbrook, he leaves it by Miss Blacklock's bed, hoping she will take it, but, like the shooting, it is an innocent who gets killed, like it's always the innocent.
Amy, it wasn't Archie, was it? What's this?
she was behind the door when the man burst in, the only one not blinded by the torch.
you saw Archie in the room the whole time, didn't you?
I don't know.
tell me you saw him in the room!
I don't know! Excuse me.
it's Edmund who's put the police onto him.
why has he done that?
because he's jealous and posssessive
Edmund's illegitimate.
there's never been a Mr. Swettenham, it's just been the two of us, and he resents me building a life for myself away from him.
he's... He's jealous of me getting a...
...a proper, respectable married name.
why is that too much to ask, hm?
Archie and I haven't committed any crime!
well...
except for one.
Mitzi, I feel very guilty about this.
it was me who stole your meat that day.
the lamb?
I wanted to treat Archie, I wanted to impress him.
it was your afternoon off.
I knew Miss Blacklock and Bunny would be at the shops.
that was the day the Swiss boy came begging?
no. No, it was your afternoon off.
I stole the meat from the safe and then I crept out into the front.
I nearly got caught red-handed because Letty came back early.
I only wanted to treat Archie.
if I had admitted to having the gun,
I would have been a suspect and you would have found out all this about me.
and I... I didn't want the village to know...
I'd been thrown out of the Army.
well, I didn't want her to know.
who?
Sadie.
I'd come here to escape all this...
...And...
and Sadie...
well, she is the best thing that ever could have happened. She is.
but if she ever finds out about my past, she would...
everyone in that room knew I had that gun!
everyone!
and any one of them could have taken it!
surely, somewhere, there's got to be a photograph of Sonia and Fabricant.
we've got to find out what this family looks like.
well, do you think he's Alex?
well... Well, what shall I do with him?
well, let him go. Trace his daughter, though.
find out where she is.
bunny and us.
Yes, that's Dora, bless her.
this looks about the right year.
europe. Here we go.
you'd have been working for the Goedlers by then, wouldn't you?
this isn't the way it was the other day when we rearranged the bookshelf, was it?
no.
all the photographs of Sonia have been removed.
they were definitely here, because we were teasing you about the clothes you were wearing, do you remember?
CLB. Is this your sister?
sorry.
dearest Charlotte, I wish you would make up your mind to see people.
your disfigurement is not nearly as bad as you think.
dear Charlotte, yesterday, Belle and Sonia went for a picnic.
Randall also took the day off. The Asvogel flotation...
may I take these?
what good can they do you?
there might be something description of Sonia's character, some incident to help build up a picture.
take them. Take them and then burn them.
they don't mean anything to anyone except me and Charlotte.
that's all gone now.
it's touching, really.
she pours out everything, in the hopes of sustaining her sister's interest in life, even suggesting new iodine treatments for her disfigurement.
and there's a clear picture of an old father in the background.
Dr. Blacklock.
a real pig-headed old bully, absolutely set in his ways.
what impression do you get of Sonia?
well, she's determined to get her own way, definitely.
strong.
and she had her own money, which is probably why this man married her.
sonia asks to be remembered to you.
she has just come in and is closing and unclosing her hands, like an angry cat sharpening its claws.
I suspect she and Randall have had another row.
you told us your husband had been killed in Italy.
Yes.
wouldn't it have been better to have told the truth?
he was a deserter.
do you have to rake everything up?
what are you going to do, tell everyone?
do you think that's really necessary, Inspector, or kind?
we expect people to tell the truth about themselves, Mrs Haymes.
edward doesn't know and I don't want him to know.
we meant nothing to his father and it's best kept that way.
to us, he went to war and never came back.
so when was the last time you saw him?
Oh, not for years.
are you sure?
it never seemed to me likely that you met Rudi Scherz in the summerhouse.
I suggest the man you actually met that afternoon was your husband.
deserters are often desperate men, Mrs Haymes, and commit many robberies.
he turned up. I hadn't seen him for years and he turned up wanting money.
and you supplied it.
what money do I have? No.
now that he's realised that,
I don't think I'll be seeing that man again, Inspector.
lamp
violets
iodine
severe Afflictoins
pearls
lambs
what's happened to the lights?
the fuse must have gone. I'll fix it.
heaven knows why you put the sheets out. It's going to rain.
well, we might get away with it.
I will see your snoopy old friend's not up yet then. No.
Oh, surely, she's scheduled some furtive little chat with the police this morning.
are you sure she's not spying on us?
of course not.
well, I think she is.
I think she's spying on all of us, that one.
will she be staying much longer?
no, I don't think so.
good.
she wasn't there.
she wasn't there.
she wasn't there!
Hinch! Hinch!
she wasn't there! She wasn't there!
Hinch, she...
Hinch, she...
Oh, Amy!
Amy! Amy! Amy!
No! No! Amy ! no, no !
I was in the pig run. I heard her come out of the house.
but it was raining .and she speaks such nonsense, really.
I didn't even look up.
what was she saying?
erm... Something about"she wasn't there" or...
who wasn't there?
had you been talking of the night of the shooting?
no.
did she say, "She wasn't there"?
or "She wasn't there"?
I don't know.
I just wanted to finish the feeding before the worst of the rain.
does it matter?
I think so.
I think she'd finally remembered who wasn't in the room.
Emma Masefeild British Passport
why do you bang like that? Am I deaf?
would you go through to the sitting room, please?
am I deaf?
inspector, am I deaf?
no, of course you're not deaf. Is Miss Blacklock in?
Ah, Inspector, I'm so pleased. I was just coming to see you.
I hope you don't mind, Miss Blacklock.
I've invited your neighbours round to see me here.
don't walk in here with your muddy shoes!
they're not muddy.
what is it, Inspector?
then what's that, then? And that?
look you are doing it again.
Amy Murgatroyd has been murdered. This morning.
can I see you in the sitting room, please?
before she died, we believe Amy Murgatroyd revealed the identity of a woman who was absent from this room during the shooting.
Yes, that's right.
a woman who was supposed to have been here the whole time.
in light of this,
I need to ask the women present to tell me where they were between half-past seven and half-past eight this morning when Amy was murdered.
then start with her, because she is Emma Fabricant.
her. Is this true?
this is her passport.
it says Emma Masefield, but...but it says Emma.
she's not Julia Simmons. She's not my cousin.
bunny. And now Amy.
and the boy.
is money so important to you? Why didn't you just kill me?
why did you have to kill Bunny?
my father changed his name from Fabricant when he split up with my mother.
Pip and I were about three.
and they split us up, as well.
I was his part of the deal.
Where's your father now?
I don't know.
he stopped contacting the last school I went to.
and then there was the war. When I landed up in London...
I looked up Randall Goedler's will and with the old lady in Scotland gaga on morphine,
I thought that Letty was my best bet.
I thought perhaps if I could get to know you, you might take pity on an abandoned child and make her, perhaps, a small allowance.
it's nothing sinister, Aunt Letty.
I know I oughtn't to have done, but...well, you see, we met at a party after I was demobbed and we got talking and I told her
I was coming here and then...
well, Julia, the real Julia, she knows nothing about this.
she's happy for Mother to think she's here with me, because she's living with a man she's not married to.
your job in Middlehurst?
it doesn't exist.
and is this not sinister? Is it not sinister that she's been weaving this tissue of lies to the police, after everything that's happened?
when Rudi Scherz was shot, you felt trapped, didn't you, Emma?
you realised you had a motive for killing Miss Blacklock and it would only be your word that you weren't involved.
you thought you would just sit tight and fade away when you could.
but they kept dying, didn't they?
she's been out walking this morning.
ask her where she's been...
ask her where she's been between seven and now
I was just walking across the fields.
in which direction? Towards Boulders!
is Pip in this room, Emma?
when did you realise it was Pip?
two days ago.
you all had her pegged as a boy.
I hadn't seen her since we were three.
I was going to come to the police this morning.
I haven't murdered anyone. I came here, like Emma, hoping to meet Miss Blacklock, hoping that if we became friends, she might help me.
why didn't you tell us who you were?
because it was too dangerous.
because I knew what the police would think,
that's exactly what you're thinking now, wasn't it!
you murdered her. What?
I told you what I heard in the shop.
I told you Miss Murgatroyd could have seen who wasn't there and you killed her! You killed her!
get her out of here!
it is always the innocent who die! Always the innocent!
come on, miss.
murderer!
are you all right?
can I get you a glass of water?
aren't you going to arrest her?
Yes.
well, arrest her now. She's a maniac!
no, Colonel, she's not.
no more than Pip and Emma are the murderers.
miss Marple.
thank you, Inspector. If you'll forgive me, Miss Blacklock,
I want to ask you about your sister, the one who died in Switzerland, who Rudi Scherz knew.
tell me about Charlotte.
she was a pretty girl, wasn't she?
Yes.
but she developed a disfigurement an enlargement of the thyroid gland, a goitre, an ugly swelling of the neck
it shattered her confidence.
Yes.
made her a recluse.
your tyrannical father was a doctor, who didn't approve of expensive operations.
he treated her himself with iodine and drugs and made her life a misery.
but after he died, you encouraged her to have the deformity removed.
that's why we went to Switzerland.
to the clinic of Dr Kuenzler, the world specialist on goitre, his removal of which leaves just a scar, that can easily be hidden.
the Blacklock sisters enjoyed their war in Switzerland, didn't they?
Charlotte was free to embrace life at last and, of course, Letty would soon be rich beyond their wildest dreams.
but then she became ill and died.
no, no.
Charlotte died.
no, no, no, no, no.
this is Charlotte.
the money was coming to the sisters, wasn't it?
they'd always regarded themselves as one.
why shouldn't it be that Charlotte had died and Letitia's still alive?
how easy, just to settle in a sleepy village where nobody knows you, and where everybody is reinventing themselves after the war, and wait for Belle Goedler to die.
this is rubbish.
but you should never have shown kindness to Dora and given her a place to live.
Dora had written to Letty and Charlotte.
Lotty responded.
there was no way in which you could keep your true identity hidden from such an old friend.
you told her why you were Letitia and she understood completely why she had to go along with it.
but her constant mistakes put you on edge.
you're worried, aren't you, Lotty?
Dora, don't.
and then the nightmare happened.
someone recognised you from Switzerland and knew which sister you were.
miss Blacklock! I remember you and your sister very well.
you see, it was such a vast sum of money and Randall Goedler so well known, your inheritance would have made the papers and you couldn't afford to risk anyone coming forward to reveal who you really were.
the money was an obsession, wasn't it?
justice for all the suffering life had inflicted on you.
life owed you.
and weak and kindly people are often the most treacherous.
does anybody believe this?
Blacklock, take off your pearls!
how much easier to arrange a hold-up like that when it's in your own home. No fire, for instance.
you've had the central heating lit.
that would have meant a light in the room.
and how easy it must have been to have oiled the door.
to have known when the house was empty.
but you had no idea that this had been witnessed, due to Mrs Swettenham's little theft.
she hadn't realised the significance of what she had seen but there you were coming through a door that wasn't known to open.
I think all that must have been fun.
fun suggesting the move of the table with Phillipa's flowers.
fun getting the revolver from the Colonel's study.
but, on the day of the hold-up
Dora had said you were worried, for then it was time for murder
Dora had also told me what you were holding just before the lights went out.
she had a vase of violets in her hand when the lights went out.
because previously you had frayed the cord of the shepherdess lamp and, as everyone was looking at the clock chiming, you spilt water from the violets and fused the lights.
I don't think...
Scherz realised for a minute that you were behind him.
you shot him. Nicked your ear with nail scissors or something and blood pouring down your dress when the lights came on making it certain you'd been shot at.
but why kill Bunny?
because Bunny, despite knowing nothing of your scheme, was, in her muddle-headed way, revealing it all.
I distinctly remember it was the shepherdess not the shepherd.
but Charlotte...
did love Dora, didn't she?
she tried to give her a "delicious death," tried to make her last day happy.
Oh, thank you.
but...
like Amy...
she could reveal too much.
take off your pearls.
Charlotte Blacklock, l'm arresting you for the murders of Rudi Scherz and Dora Bunner...
take them off! Take them off.
get her off me!
take them off!
I'm sorry, Bunny.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Bunny.
I am so sorry.
sir!
will she hang?
Yes.
she deserves to hang.
well, goodbye, Miss Marple.
goodbye, dear.
take care of your son.
and your sister.
surprise!
Alex. Do not interrupt me when I'm daydreaming.
when a zebra's in the zone, leave him alone.
come on, Marty. Just wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
Hey, man, thanks.
Hey, I got something stuck in my teeth.
it's driving me crazy. Can you help me? Please?
you came to the right place, my friend.
Dr. Marty, D. D.S. is in the house.
please hop on top of my sterilized examination table, if you may.
I don't see anything. - It's on the left.
Oh, sorry.
okay, just don't talk with your mouth full.
right here. What the heck is this doing in there?
happy birthday!
Aw, hey, thanks, man.
you put it in behind the tooth. You all right.
these aren't even on the shelf yet. Here. Check it out.
look at that. Ooh! Look at that. - Look at that. It's snowing.
ten years old, huh? A decade.
double digits. The big 1-0.
you don't like it?
no, no, it's great. - You hate it.
I should've gotten you the Alex alarm clock. That's the big seller.
no, no, no. The present's great, really.
it's just that another year's come and gone and I'm still doing the same old thing.
stand over here. Trot over there. Eat some grass. Walk back over here.
I see your problem. - Maybe I should go to law school.
you just need to break out of that boring routine.
how? - Throw out the old act.
who knows what you'll do. Make it up as you go along.
ad lib. Improvise. On the fly. Boom, boom, boom.
Really? - You know, make it fresh.
fresh, huh? Okay. I could do fresh.
works for me.
here come the people, Marty. I love the people.
it's fun people fun time!
let's go, Gloria! Up and at 'em. We're open!
what day is it?
it's Friday. Field trip day.
Yes, it's field trip day. Let's get up and go...
...in ten more minutes.
come on!
Melman, Melman, Melman! Melman, Melman, Melman!
wake up! Rise and shine! It's another fabulous morning in the Big Apple.
let's go.
not for me. I'm calling in sick. - What?
I found another brown spot on my shoulder. Right here. See?
right there. You see?
Melman, you know it's all in your head. Hm?
let's go! Come on!
Phil! Wake up, you filthy monkey.
Oh, I'm going to be fresh.
straight out the ground. Tasty fresh! Freshalicious.
ziploc fresh.
ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, the Central Park Zoo proudly presents:
show them the cat. Who's the cat?
the king of New York City.
Alex the lion.
it's showtime.
roar!
gather around, people. Big show about to start.
check out the zebra taking care of biz. That's right.
just smile and wave, boys.
smile and wave.
Kowalski, progress report.
we're 500 feet from the main sewer line.
and the bad news? - We've broken our last shovel.
right.
Rico, you're on litter patrol. We need shovels.
and find more Popsicle sticks. We don't want to risk another cave-in.
and me, skipper?
I want you to look cute and cuddly, private.
today we're going to blow this dump.
come here. Come here. Come on, penguin.
Yeah! You don't see that on Animal Planet.
Ha-ha.
well, show's over, folks. Thanks for coming.
I hope you thought it was fresh.
I'll be here all week.
in fact, I'll be here for my whole life.
three hundred and sixty-five days a year, including Christmas, Hanukkah, Halloween, Kwanzaa.
please don't forget to never spay or neuter your pets.
and tip your cabbie, because he's broke.
you, quadruped. Sprechen sie Englisch?
I sprechen.
what continent is this? - Manhattan.
Hoover Dam! We're still in New York.
abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.
Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute.
what are you guys doing?
we're digging to Antarctica.
Ant-who-tica?
can you keep a secret, my monochromatic friend?
do you ever see any penguins running free around New York City?
of course not. We don't belong here. It's just not natural.
this is all some kind of whacked-out conspiracy.
we're going to the wide-open spaces of Antarctica.
to the wild.
the wild? You could actually go there?
that sounds great.
Hey, hold up. Where is this place? Tell me where it is.
you didn't see anything.
right?
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry. No, sir.
for his final appearance of the day, the king of New York City.
Alex the lion.
roar!
thank you. Thank you very much.
you guys are great. You're a great crowd. Give yourselves a hand.
thank you. Oh. Thank you.
Oh! Well. Thank you.
Oh, that's too kind. Too kind.
underpants!
everybody get home safe. Hey! Check out my Web site.
twenty-four hour Alex Cam. Watch me sleep.
this is the life.
that's the spot.
Oh! I'm in heaven.
Ooh, it's Marty's birthday. - Just rip it open.
what is it? - Come on. Open it up. What you got?
a thermometer.
Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it.
I wanted to give you something personal. That was my first rectal thermometer.
mother... - I'll miss that bad boy.
get the cake. Melman, come on.
happy birthday to you
you live in a zoo
you look like a monkey
and you smell like one too
I say.
Aw, well, now, you guys are just embarrassing me.
and yourselves.
what? We worked on that all week.
let's go. Let's make a wish, babycakes.
What'd you wish for? - Nope. Can't tell you that.
come on. Tell.
no siree. I'm telling you, it's bad luck.
you want some bad luck, I'll blab it out.
but if you want to be safe, I'll keep my mouth shut.
would you just tell us? What could happen?
okay.
I wished I could go to the wild!
the wild?!
I told you it was bad luck.
the wild? Are you nuts?
that is the worst idea I've ever heard.
it's unsanitary.
the penguins are going. So why can't I?
the penguins are psychotic.
come on. Just imagine going back to nature.
back to your roots. Clean air, wide-open spaces!
I hear there's wide-open spaces in Connecticut.
Connecticut? - You got to go over to Grand Central.
then you got to take the Metro-North train... north?
so one could take the train? Just hypothetically.
come on. What would Connecticut have to offer us?
Lyme disease. - Thank you, Melman.
no, I just want...
there's none of this in the wild.
this is a highly refined type of food thing that you do not find in the wild.
you ever thought there might be more to life than steak, Alex?
he didn't mean that, baby. No, no, no.
doesn't it bother you guys that you don't know anything about life outside this zoo?
Nuh-uh. Nope. - Mm-mm.
well, I mean, come on. That's just one subject.
you got a little schmutz right there on your...
Thanks, guys. Thanks for the party. It was great.
really.
what's eating him?
maybe you should talk to him. Go over and give him a little pep talk.
Hey, I already gave him a snow globe. I can't top that.
I can see where this is going.
it is getting late. I guess I'm going to...
come on. He's your best friend.
all right, all right. Okay.
night, Marty. - Night, Glo.
what a day.
I mean, I tell you, itjust doesn't get any better than this, you know?
Ooh! Ltjust did. Even the star's out.
not going to find a star like that in the wild.
helicopter.
Marty. Buddy. Listen.
everybody has days when they think the grass might be greener somewhere else.
Alex.
look at me.
I'm ten years old. My life is half over.
and I don't even know if I'm black with white stripes...
...or white with black stripes.
Marty.
I'm thinking of a song.
Alex. Please. Not now.
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song. I think you're familiar with it.
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't. No, no, no.
I'm not listening.
start spreadin' the news
I don't know you.
I'm leaving today - We are a great big part of it - He's funny. Who is that?
come on. You know you know the words.
two little words.
new York.
new York
shut up, shut up, shut up! Hey, I'm sleeping here!
we're not all nocturnal, you know!
I'll knock your "turnal" right off, pal.
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?
you mess with him, you mess with me, Howard.
you're a bigmouth lion. - See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes.
we make a great team, the two of us.
we sure do. No doubt about it.
so, what are you going to do? Go running off to the wild by yourself?
no. - Good.
you and me. Let's go.
what? - The wild.
come on. You and me together.
it's a straight shot down Fifth Avenue to Grand Central.
we'll grab a train, we'll head north.
we can be back by morning. No one will ever know.
you're joking. Right?
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course I'm joking. Give me a break.
like we're going to get a train.
don't do that. You really had me worried there.
Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack.
Yeah, me too. I'll need to rest my voice for tomorrow.
it's Seniors' Day, you know. Have to roar extra loud.
give them a little jolt. You know?
good night, AllyAI.
they forgot to turn off the ambience again.
don't worry. It's cool.
you know, I got it.
much better.
come on, now, baby.
my little filet.
my little filet mignon with a little fat around the edges.
I like that. I like a little fat on my steak.
my sweet, juicy steak. You are a rare delicacy.
Alex. Alex. Alex!
what? What?
you suck your thumb?
what is it, Melman?
you know how I have that bladder infection and I have to get up every two hours?
I got up to pee and looked over at Marty's pen, which I usually don't do.
I don't know why, but I did. And...
what? What's going on?
it's Marty. He's gone.
gone! What do you mean, "gone"?
how long has he been working on this?
Marty!
Marty!
he wouldn't fit down there.
Marty? Marty! Marty!
this doesn't make any sense. Where would he go?
Connecticut! - He wouldn't.
Oh, no! What are we going to do?
I mean, we got to call somebody!
Hello? Get me Missing Animals. And hurry.
we've got a lost zebra probably on the way to Connecticut, and we need...
Hello? Hello? - Wait a second.
we can't call the people. - What the...?
they'll be really mad.
it'll get Marty transferred for good. Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Mm-hm, I know that's right.
we got to go after him. He's not thinking straight.
let's stop him from making the biggest mistake of his life.
he's probably out there lost and cold, confused.
poor little guy.
come on.
one of us should wait here in case he comes back.
not now. This is an intervention. We all got to go.
what's the fastest way to Grand Central?
you should take Lexington. - Melman!
okay. "We." We should take Lexington. - What about Park?
no, Park goes two ways. You can't time the lights.
I heard Tom Wolfe is speaking at Lincoln Center.
well, of course we're going to throw poo at him.
we should've taken Park.
you sure this is the fastest way to Grand Central Station?
I don't know! That's what Melman said.
Hey. Hey, you, guys.
that room has some nifty little sinks you can wash up in, and look!
free mints!
this isn't a field trip.
this is an urgent mission to save Marty from throwing his life away.
now, where's the train?
here it comes.
what did Marty say to you? I asked you to talk to him.
I did! I did! I don't understand. He said, "Let's go.
I said, "Are you crazy?" He says, "I'm ten years old.
and he has black-and-white stripes, and so then we sang and...
what you got to do is go straight back down West 42nd.
it's on your left after Vanderbilt.
if you hit the Chrysler Building, you've gone too far.
thanks a lot, officer.
Hey! Wait for the light.
freak.
did you say "zebra"? - That's right. A zebra.
right in front of me.
can I shoot it? - Negative.
then I'm going to need some backup.
Aw! Knicks lost again. - What are you going to do.
did that say "Grand Central Station" or "my aunt's constipation"?
this is it.
grand Central Station.
it's grand and it's central.
move aside. We have an emergency here. This is an emergency situation.
Hey, hey. Just chill out. It's not that big of an emergency.
upstairs, downstairs.
how do you like that?
lady! What is wrong with you?
Ow! Get a grip on yourselves, people.
you're a bad kitty.
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.
looks like I'll have to take the Stamford local.
I got him! I've got him!
he's got him!
he's got him! He's got him! He's got...
I got something for you!
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Whoa! What are you guys doing here?
I am so glad we found you. - We were so worried about you.
don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine. Look at me. I'm fine.
you're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.
you hear that? Marty's fine. That's good to know.
because I was wondering...
how could you do this to us? I thought we were your friends!
what's the big deal? I was coming back.
don't ever do this again. Do you hear me?
do you hear him? - Guys, we're running out of time.
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?
...do this again! Don't you ever, ever do this again!
come here.
we've been ratted out, boys.

cute and cuddly, boys. Cute and cuddly.
if you have any poo, fling it now.
it's the Man.
good evening, officers.
no. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay?
you're not good with the "putting words together and their coming out good" thing. You keep it "shh.
Hey! How you doing? You know what? Everything's cool.
we just had a little situation here. Little internal situation.
my friend went a little crazy. Happens to everybody.
the city gets to us all. Went a little cuckoo in the head.
don't be calling me cuckoo in the head.
just shush! I will handle this.
Oh! I got him!
go, go, go! Right here, please.
would you give a guy a break?
we'll take my little friend home and forget this ever happened. All right?
no harm, no foul, right?
Hey, it's cool. It's me, Alex the lion. From the zoo.
what's the matter with them?
I feel really, really weird.
I love you guys.
I love you so much.
last night's dramatic incident in Grand Central is an example of what animal rights wackos have been shouting for years:
animals clearly don't belong in captivity.
they are to be sent back to their natural habitat, where they will live their lives in the freedom they desire.
Hey. Little help? - He's awake! He's awake!
do something!
Oh, man.
Oh, my head.
what the...?
wait. Where? What?
I'm in a box! Oh, no. No, no! Not the box.
Oh, no, they can't transfer me. Not me!
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
darkness creeping in.
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
walls closing in around me.
so alone. So alone.
Alex! Alex, are you there? - Marty?
Yeah! Talk to me, buddy. - Oh, Marty! You're here!
what's going on? You okay? - This doesn't look good.
Alex, Marty, is that you? - Gloria!
you're here too! - I am loving the sound of your voice.
what is going on? - We're all in crates.
Oh, no!
sleeping just knocks me out. - Melman!
is that Melman?
are you okay? - Yeah. No, I'm fine.
I often doze off while I'm getting an MRI.
you're not getting an MRI. - CAT scan?
no CAT scan. It's a transfer. It's a zoo transfer.
zoo transfer?! Oh, no. No, no, I can't be transferred.
I have an appointment with Dr. Goldberg at 5: 00.
there are prescriptions that have to be filled.
no other zoo could afford my medical care.
and I am not going HMO.
take it easy, Melman. It's going to be okay.
we are going to be okizay. - No, we're not going to be okizay.
now, because of you, we're ruined!
because of me? I fail to see how this is my fault.
you're kidding, right, Marty? - You. You ticked off the people.
you bit the hand, Marty. You bit the hand.
I don't know who I am. I got to go find myself in the wild." Oh, please.
I did not ask you to come after me, did I?
he does have a point.
I did say we should stay at the zoo, but you guys...
Melman, just shut it.
you suggested this idea to him in the first place.
leave Melman out of this. - Thank you, Gloria.
besides, it's not my fault that we were transferred.
Melman, shut it. Does anybody feel nauseous?
I feel nauseous. - Melman, you always feel nauseous.

Oh, no.

Hey, anyone! Hello!
get me out of this thing. Somebody. Hello?
get me out of this thing right now!
Hello? Somebody?
Alex? Is that you?
Melman, I got you. Hang on! Hang on. I got you.
Melman! I got you, buddy.
wait a sec, Melman. Wait right there.
what are you doing? - I'm getting you out of the box.
relax. - Alex?

here goes nothing!
wait, wait, wait, wait. - Hold still!
wait, Alex. - Hold still.
no, come on. - Here I come!
look! Look! Look! Look!
it's Gloria. It's Gloria!
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.
Oh, my...
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.
Yeah! All right! That's right!
left! Left! Left. No, no, your left! Your left! Your left!
right here's good.
I don't have anything on me right now. I'll have to get you later.
to you too.
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.
hold up! - I'm going to kill you!
come here! Don't run away from me! - Calm down!
if you keep running, I'm going to just kill you more!
Oh, look at us.
we're all here together. Safe and sound.
Yeah, here we are.
where exactly is "here"?
San Diego.
San Diego?
white sandy beaches, cleverly simulated natural environment, wide-open enclosures.
I'm telling you, this could be the San Diego Zoo.
complete with fake rocks.
wow, that looks real.
San Diego? What could be worse than San Diego?
I don't know. This place is crackalacking!
Oh, I could hang here. I could hang here.
I'll kill you! - Take it easy!
strangle you! - Calm down.
then bury you, dig you up, clone you and kill your clones.
20-second timeout. - I'll never talk to you again.
now, look. We're just going to find the people, get checked in and have this mess straightened out.
Oh, great. This is just great. San Diego.
now I'll have to compete with Shamu and his smug little grin.
I can't top that. Can't top it.
I'm ruined! I'm done. I'm out of the business.
it's your fault, Marty! You've ruined me.
come on, Alex. Do you honestly think
I intended all of this to happen?
you want me to say that I'm sorry? Is that what you want?
okay, I'm...
he just shushed me.
Marty, look, you've got to be just a little bit more und...
don't you shush me. - Do you hear that? Don't you hear that?
I hear it now. - Where there's music, there's people.
go to the head honcho. - A sidewalk would be nice.
Yeah, what a dump.
they should call it the San Di-lame-o Zoo.
first they tell you, "We got this great open plan thing. Let animals run wild.
next thing, flowers in your hair, everybody's hugging everybody.
this place kind of grows on you. This way, guys! Come on!
what the...?
Oh, no!
okay, let's make a good impression on the people.
smiles, everyone. Let's get it together.
is that the best you can do? - Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas.
well, great. Let's make gas look good.
Wow! - It's not people. It's animals.
california animals. Dude.
this is like a Puffy party.
I like to move it, move it I like to move it, move it - Ya like to - Move it
I like to move it, move it I like to move it, move it

I just saw 26 blatant health code violations.
I'm loving San Diego. This place is off the chizain.

we should've brought chips and dip.
wait.
Where's Alex? What happened to him? He was right behind us. Wasn't he?
I don't know where he's at, but he's missing one heck of a party.
the fossa are attacking! Run for your lives!
fossa hungry. - Fossa eat.
I hate spiderwebs.
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.
thanks for waiting up. Really appreciate it.
Hey, hi. We just got in from New York, and we're looking for a supervisor.
because we've been sitting on that beach back there for hours, and nobody's even bothered to show up.
I don't know how things are normally run around here, but there's been some sort of major screwup, which is cool.
so if you could point us towards the administrative offices, we'll...
well, howdy-do.
spider! Spider! Spider on my back!
Maurice, did you see that?
he scared the fossa away.
come on, Gloria. Get it.
get it! Get it! Get it!
that's it! Smack it! - Get it, get it!
whip it! Whip it good! Where'd it go?
king Julien, what are they? What are they?!
they are aliens. Savage aliens from the savage future.
they've come to kill us. And take our women. And our precious metals.
get up, Mort. Do not be near the king's feet, okay?
we're hiding. Be quiet, everyone. Including me.
who's making that noise?
Oh, it's me again.
there it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!
enough! Enough with the stick. - I think she got it.
is it still on me? I hate spiders.
it's okay. It's gone.
they are savages.
tonight we die.
the feet. I told you... I told you to... I told every...
didn't I tell him about the feet?
he did tell you about the feet.
wait. I have a plan. - Really?
I have devised a cunning test to see whether these are savage killers.
hi there.
you let me handle it. Alex handles it. Marty does nothing.
hi there.
Oh, jeez. Sorry.
Oh, Alex, what'd you do? - Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's okay.
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion. Oh, jeez!
Aw, Alex! - Oh, you poor little baby.
did that big mean lion scare you?
he did? He's a big, bad old puddy tat, isn't he?
come on. Mama'll hold you. Awww, look at you.
they are so cute from a reasonable distance.
aren't you the sweetest little thing. I just want to dunk him in my coffee.
they're just a bunch of pansies.
I don't know.
there's something about that one with the crazy hairdo that I find suspicious.
nonsense, Maurice.
come on, everybody. Let's go and meet the pansies!
presenting your royal highness, our illustrious King Julien Xlll, self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs, et cetera. Hooray, everybody.
he's got style.
what is he, like, king of the guinea pigs?
I think it's a squirrel.
welcome, giant pansies.
please feel free to bask in my glow.
definitely a squirrel. - Yep. Squirrel.
we thank you with enormous gratitude for chasing away the fossa.
the "whossa"? - The fossa.
they annoy us by trespassing, interrupting our parties - and ripping our limbs off. - Good.
we're just trying to find out where the people are, so...
what big teeth you have. Man!
shame on you, Maurice. Can you not see that you have insulted the freak?
you must tell me, who the heck are you?
I'm Alex. The Alex. And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.
and just where are you giants from?
we're from New York and...
all hail the New York giants!
underworld
the war had all but ground to a halt in the blink of an eye.
Lucian, the most feared and ruthless leader ever to rule the Lycan clan...
...had finally been killed.
the Lycan horde scattered to the wind...
...in a single evening of flame and retribution.
victory, it seemed, was in our grasp...
...the very birthright of the Vampires.
nearly 6 centuries had passed since that night.
yet the ancient feud proved unwilling to follow Lucian to the grave.
though Lycans were fewer in number...
...the war itself had become more perilous.
for the moon no longer held her sway.
older, more powerful Lycans were now able to change at will.
the weapons had evolved, but our orders remained the same:
hunt them down and kill them off, one by one.
a most successful campaign.
perhaps too successful.
for those like me, a Death Dealer...
...this signaled the end of an era.
like the weapons of the previous century...
...we, too, would become obsolete.
pity, because I lived for it.
bloods!
lt's all right. lt's all right. You're gonna be okay.
you're acting like a pack of rabid dogs!
and that, gentlemen...
...simply will not do.
not if you expect to defeat the Vampires on their own ground.
not if you expect to survive at all.
Pierce! Taylor!
put some clothes on, will you?
we have a serious problem.
l'll have to run a few tests.
lt's definitely an irradiated fluid of some sort.
ultraviolet ammunition.
daylight, harnessed as a weapon.
you expect me to believe that a mangy animal...
...came up with a bullet specifically engineered to kill Vampires?
no, l'm betting it's military.
something they stole. Some sort of high-tech tracer round.
l don't care where they got these things.
Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel could still be out there.
let's gather the Death Dealers and go back.
absolutely not. Not now. Not for a random incursion.
the Awakening is a few days off, and this house is in unrest as it is.
random? They opened fire on us in full view of the public.
and from what l heard in that tunnel...
you said you didn't see anything.
l know what l heard, and l know what my gut tells me.
there could be dozens of Lycans down there.
who knows, maybe more. Hundreds.
we've hunted them to the brink of extinction.
Kraven's right, Selene.
there's not been a den of that magnitude for centuries.
not since the days of Lucian.
l know that, Kahn.
but l'd rather you prove me wrong by checking it out.
have your men tighten things up.
l'll have Soren assemble a search team.
no, l want to lead the team myself.
absolutely not! Soren will handle it.
hundreds, really?
Viktor would believe me.
l'd never treat you like that.
of course not.
now run along and make sure she's dressed and ready for her guests.
lt's a waste of time, you know.
what is?
l doubt Viktor would want you freezing in here, staring at his tomb for hours.
no, he'd want the Death Dealers out there, scouring every inch of the city.
Kraven. l'll never understand why Viktor left him in charge.
he's a bureaucrat, not a warrior.
we need to get you ready.
for what?
the party.
Amelia's envoy will be here any minute.
Oh, yes.
you should definitely wear this one. lt's perfect.
they were after you.
he's attractive...
...for a human.
who's attractive?
l planned to have you at my side this evening.
take Erika. She's dying to be at your side.
lf you ask me, you take this warrior business far too seriously.
you can't undo the past, no matter how many you kill.
and besides...
...What's the point in being immortal...
...if you deny yourself life's simple pleasures?
do you see this human?
what of him?
l'm beginning to think the Lycans...
blast!
put on something elegant and be quick about it.
Kraven, l'm serious. l think they were following him.
other than food, why would Lycans stalk a human?
any progress?
let's find out.
negative.
you heading home?
Yeah, Nicholas gave me a couple hours off.
by the way...
...he said you did a terrific job tonight with the surgery.
Yeah.
take it easy.
we were ambushed.
death Dealers, three of them.
and the candidate?
we lost him.
you lost him?
look at this mess.
ag rounds. High content.
prevented him from making the change.
no use in digging out the rest. Silver's penetrated his organs.
regeneration's impossible at this point.
let's take these out.
relax.
the Vampires didn't realize you were following a human...
...did they, Raze?
no.
l mean, l don't think so.
you don't think, or you don't know?
I'm not sure.
negative.
l really must have a look at this Michael.
must l do everything myself?
our noble houses may be separated by a great ocean...
...but we are equally committed to the survival of the bloodlines.
and when Amelia arrives to awaken Marcus...
...in just two days' time...
...we shall once again be united as a single coven!
we want to thank our hosts for their generous hospitality.
he comes in, he does his job and then he goes home.
other than that, I don't know what to tell you.
interns work around the clock. We don't have much of a life.
you know where we can find him?
no.
you can try him at home, or you'll have to wait till he gets back.
he's not in some kind of trouble, is he?
this is Michael. I'm not in right now. Please leave a message.
Michael, it's Adam. The police were just in the hospital looking for you.
they were convinced you were involved with a shootout.
I told them there's no way you'd be involved with that...
...but they're looking for you. Right now.
why are they after you?
shit!
Hello, Michael.
what the fuck is going on?
stop the car.
stop the car!
back off!
okay.
okay.
all right.
but you've lost a lot of blood.
lf you don't stop the car, you'll get us both killed.
l'm not screwing around!
neither am l!
shut up and hold on. l'll be fine.
shit!
a second escape. lmpressive.
perhaps Raze wasn't overstating matters.
raze didn't bring back this.
lf Michael is indeed The Carrier, the Vampires could...
relax, old friend.
l've tasted his flesh.
just two days till full moon.
soon, he will be a Lycan.
soon, he will come looking for us.
lt's a shame we don't have more.
positive.
lay still. Your skull's taken a good knock.
you've been unconscious for a while.
do you have any idea why those men were after you?
where am l?
you're safe.
l'm Selene.
so, for once, the rumors were true.
the whole house has been absolutely buzzing about your new pet.
are you going to try to turn him?
of course not.
so why did you bring him here?
he saved my life.
why are you here?
Kraven sent me.
he wants to see you. Now.
this is completely unacceptable!
you go against my orders and spend the night away from the mansion with a human? A human you've since brought back to my house.
as far as l'm concerned, this is still Viktor's house.
look, l don't want to argue.
understand that Michael is somehow important to the Lycans...
so now it's " Michael " !
would you just hear me out?
lt's beyond me why you're so obsessed over this ridiculous theory.
Lucian wouldn't be a bit interested in a human...
...Michael or otherwise.
wait a minute.
you're infatuated with him, aren't you?
now, that's a ridiculous theory.
ls it?
leave us!
l sure hope you never get pissed off with me.
hold on.
check this out.
go ahead. Squeeze off a few.
eject the mag.
you've copied the Lycan rounds. Silver nitrate.
a lethal dose.
they won't dig these out, like our usual rounds.
straight into the bloodstream. Ain't nothing to dig out.
tell me, Kahn.
do you believe Lucian died the way they say?
Kraven telling war stories again?
that's my point.
lt's nothing but an ancient story. His story.
there's not a shred of proof he killed Lucian, only his word.
l've never underestimated Kraven's lust for advancement...
...but Viktor believed him and that's all that matters.
where you going with this anyway?
nowhere.
engaging Death Dealers in public and chasing after some human...
...was not what l had in mind. You were told to set up shop and lay low!
calm yourself, Kraven!
the human doesn't concern you.
and besides, l've laid low for quite long enough.
just keep your men at bay, Lucian.
at least for the time being.
don't force me to regret our arrangement.
you just concentrate on your part.
remember, l've bled for you once already.
without me, you'd have nothing.
you'd be nothing.
of the scores of brave souls who entered Lucian's fortress...
...a single Vampire survived: Kraven...
...who was richly rewarded for not only setting the great blaze...
...but for returning with evidence of the Lycan master's demise...
...the branded skin, cut from Lucian's very arm.
l've been looking for you. He's been bitten.
your human, he's been marked by a Lycan.
did Kraven put you up to this?
no. l saw the wound with my own eyes, l swear it.
but what about the Covenant?
you know it's forbidden!
and ever since he bit me, l've been...
l've been having these hallucinations and these delusions.
all l know is, it feels like my skull is splitting in half.
okay, so a full-grown man bit you?
Jesus.
are you sure this wasn't a dog?
l said, it was a man. lt was a man.
okay, l got it.
he was after me.
and that woman from the subway...
what woman?
haven't you been listening to me? She took me hostage!
all right.
Just...Please...
l'll help you get this all sorted out, all right? l'll be right back.
let go, Michael.
let go.
just calm down, okay? l'm gonna be back in a minute.
that's a promise. All right.
please forgive me...
...but l desperately need your guidance.
kahn wants to see you.
to my knowledge...
...an Awakening has never been attempted by one such as myself.
the elders hold the power to organize their memories and thoughts...
...into a single, cohesive vision...
...a detailed record of their reign.
I can only hope Viktor will hear my plea.
please forgive me, but l desperately need your guidance.
l apologize for awakening you ahead of schedule...
...but l fear we may all be in grave danger.
especially you, my lord, if left in your weakened state.
for l believe that Lucian is alive and well.
here. Now. ln this very city...
...preparing to hit us during the Awakening ceremony.
even more disturbing...
...is that if l'm correct...
...it would mean that Kraven is in league with him.
what's so pressing?
take a look.
Selene!
I want to speak with Selene!
ls that Michael?
ls it Michael?
what the hell is going on?
what's happening to me?
I'm coming out.
lf you go to him, you'll never be welcome in this house again.
now that Viktor's awake, we'll see what he has to say about that.
get in.
look, l warned her. l warned her, but she didn't listen.
l should've told you sooner.
told me what?
her human, Michael...
...he's not a human at all.
he's a Lycan.
what?
what's this ruckus?
never come here again. They'll kill you.
Why? Who are you people?
leave us.
like it or not, you're in the middle of a war that's raged for 1 000 years.
a blood feud between Vampires and Lycans.
werewolves.
consider yourself lucky.
most humans die within an hour of being bitten by an immortal.
the viruses we transmit are deadly.
and if you bit me, l'd become a Vampire instead?
no, you'd die.
no one's ever survived a bite from both species.
by rights, l'd stop the car and kill you myself...
why are you helping me?
l'm not.
l track down and kill your kind.
my only interest is finding out why Lucian wants you so badly.
do you know why l've been awakened, servant?
no, my lord.
but l'll soon find out.
you mean when you find her.
Yes, my lord.
you must let her come to me.
we have much to discuss, Selene and l.
she has shown me a great many disturbing things.
things that will be dealt with soon enough.
this coven has grown weak, decadent.
perhaps l should have left someone else in charge of my affairs.
still...
...her memories...
...are chaotic.
there's no sense of time.
please, my lord, let me summon assistance.
you're in need of rest.
l've rested enough.
what you will do is summon Marcus.
but he still slumbers, my lord.
Amelia and the Council members are arriving tomorrow night...
...to awaken Marcus.
not you, my lord.
you've been awakened a full century ahead of schedule.
that bitch has betrayed me.
now he knows everything she's been obsessing about.
wait.
are you to be trusted?
of course.
meet me in my quarters in 20 minutes.
lt's time l filled you in on a few things.
l'm seeing these things, these hallucinations.
they're not hallucinations, they're memories.
you've been bitten. His memories have been passed to you.
this is one of the places we use for interrogations. lt should be safe.
we own it.
first there was synthetic plasma, now this.
once it's approved, it should be our newest cash crop.
lt's cloned blood.
what are these for?
Lycans are allergic to silver.
lf we don't get our bullets out quickly, they die during questioning.
what do you do with them after?
we put the bullets back in.
how are things progressing?
we're ready.
why do you hate them so much?
l've already told you, we're at war.
so you're just following orders?
why can't you just answer the question?
fine.
something was in the stable tearing our horses to pieces.
l couldn't have saved my mother.
or my sister.
their screams woke me.
my father died outside, trying to fend them off.
l stood at my door...
...about to run to my nieces' room when...
twin girls.
barely six years old.
butchered...
...like animals.
Jesus Christ.
the next thing l knew, l was in his arms.
the war had spilled into our house.
he'd been tracking the Lycans for days.
he drove them off and saved me.
who?
Viktor.
the oldest and strongest of us.
that night, he made me a Vampire.
he gave me the strength to avenge my family.
since then, l've never looked back.
l saw your pictures.
who is the woman? Your wife?
lt may be wise to keep a closer eye on our cousins.
l'll have Raze see to it immediately.
l'm afraid that l'm going to have to place my faith in you, my friend.
time is running short.
I tried to swerve, but he hit us anyway.
he sent us right into the oncoming lane.
when l came to...
...l realized that part of the engine was in the front seat.
and she was pinned there, 6 inches from me...
...in this horrible position.
l think she was in shock because she just...
...kept asking me over and over again if l was all right.
she was more worried about me.
you know, if l knew then what l know now, l could have saved her.
there's no doubt in my mind about that.
but instead she died right there...
...about two minutes before the ambulance arrived.
after that, l didn't see any reason to stick around.
l spent a summer here with my grandfather when l was a kid so...
after l got my degree, l just...
l took off.
l came over here to move on, to forget.
lt seemed like a good idea at the time.
and have you?
moved on?
have you?
l need you to keep what l'm about to tell you under the strictest confidence.
lt can wait.
who started the war?
they did.
or at least that's what we've been led to believe.
digging into the past is forbidden.
l should be heading back.
what about me?
Viktor will know what to do. l'll come back.
l won't stay alone.
you will if you want to live.
no. l want to go with you.
what are you doing?
when the full moon rises tomorrow...
...you will change, you will kill, and you will feed.
lt's unavoidable.
l can't leave you free to roam around. l'm sorry.
a single round won't kill you, but silver prevents transformation.
at least for a few hours.
lf l don't return in time, do yourself a favor.
use it.
yeah?
my lord. She's here.
how could you do this to me? Embarrass me like this?
the entire coven knows that l had plans for us.
there is no us!
you'll go before Viktor...
...and tell him exactly what l tell you to!
from here on out, you'll do as l say.
ls that in any way unclear?
come closer, my child.
outside.
come on, move it.
l've been lost without you, my lord.
constantly hounded by Kraven and his never-ending infatuation.
lt is the oldest story in the book.
he desires the one thing he cannot have.
now, tell me...
...why have you come to believe that Lucian still lives?
Yeah.
l've given you all the proof you need.
lncoherent thoughts and images, nothing more.
which is precisely why the Awakening is performed by an elder.
you do not possess the necessary skills.
but l did see Lucian. l shot him. You must believe me.
the chain has never been broken. Not once.
not in 1 4 centuries.
not since we elders first began to leapfrog through time.
one awake, two asleep. That's the way of it.
lt is Marcus' turn to reign, not mine.
there's been a complication.
but l had no choice.
the coven is in danger, and Michael is the key...
don't
Oh. Yes.
the Lycan.
please.
give me the chance to get proof you require.
fine.
I will leave it to Kraven to collect the proof...
...if there is any.
how could you trust him over me?
because he is not the one who has been tainted by an animal.
l love you...
...like a daughter, but you leave me with no choice.
these rules are in place for a good reason...
...and they are the only reason we have survived this long.
you will not be shown an ounce of leniency.
when Amelia arrives, the Council will convene and decide your fate.
you have broken the chain and the Covenant!
you must be judged!
you should've listened to me and stayed out of this.
now you'll be lucky if l can convince the Council to spare your life.
tell me.
did you have the nerve to cut the skin from his arm, or did Lucian do it?
mark my words.
soon, you'll be seeing things my way.
no one opens this door. Understood?
l can't afford to have my future queen run off with that Lycan again.
shit.
change of plans. Amelia will be picked up by Soren and his team.
that's our job.
not anymore.
why are you helping me?
l'm not. l'm helping me.
what's going on?
the perimeter sensor's been tripped.
we're locking down the mansion.
lt's Selene. She's escaped, to go to him, to Michael.
l want that Lycan's head on a plate.
we need to go.
get down!
go. Go.
jump.
are you fucking kidding me?
any luck?
false alarm.
the dogs would've been all over it if anything had gotten near that fence.
Amelia should have arrived by now.
Yes.
look, l want you to slip off the property and find out what's keeping her.
you've got it.
maybe we should pull over and dose him.
fuck him. He'll be all right. We're almost there.
Oh, shit. He's not gonna make it. Pull over. Pull over!
get the kit.
stick him. Stick him.
my lord.
Viktor wants to speak with you.
my lord.
l sent for Selene...
...not you.
she's defied your orders...
...and fled the mansion, my lord.
your incompetence is becoming most taxing.
lt's not my fault. She's become obsessed...
...thinks that l'm at the core of some ridiculous conspiracy.
and here's my proof.
now, l want you to tell them exactly what you told me.
all right, all right.
we've been searching for someone with a special trait.
a direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus...
...Hungarian, a warlord...
...who came to power in the early seasons of the fifth century.
just in time to watch a plague ravage his village.
he alone survived.
somehow, his body was able to change the disease...
...mold it to his benefit.
he became the first true immortal.
and years later, he fathered at least two children...
...who inherited this same trait.
the sons of the Corvinus clan.
one bitten by bat, one by wolf...
...one to walk the lonely road of mortality as a human.
lt's a ridiculous legend. Nothing!
that may be...
...but our species do have a common ancestor.
a mutation of the original virus...
...is directly linked to his bloodline.
there is a descendant of Corvinus lying there........
...not three feet from you.
Yes.
but he's already a Vampire. We needed a pure source...
...untainted. An exact duplicate of the original virus...
...which we learned...
...was hidden away in the genetic code of his human descendants...
...and passed along in its latent form...
...down through the ages...
...all the way to Michael Corvin.
for years, we tried to combine their bloodlines.
and for years we failed.
it was useless.
even at the cellular level, our species seemed destined to destroy each other.
that is, until we found Michael.
the Corvinus strain allows for a perfect union.
a triple-celled platelet...
...which holds unspeakable power.
there can be no such union.
and to speak of it is heresy.
we'll see.
once Lucian has injected himself with Michael's blood.
Lucian is dead.
according to whom?
l need you to do something for me.
l can assure you, my child...
...Kraven will pay with his life.
soon, this house will lie in ruins.
not before you.
no, No, No, wait. Wait.
you and you alone will know the truth of this.
lf Lucian was able to get his hands on the blood of a Pure-Born...
...a powerful elder like Amelia...
...or yourself...
...and inject it along with Michael's blood...
abomination.
Half-Vampire...
...half-Lycan, but stronger than both.
l need to speak with Kahn.
my lord...
...the Council members have been assassinated.
what of Amelia?
they bled her dry.
lt has already begun.
l'm sorry l doubted you.
fear not, my child, absolution will be yours...
...the moment you kill the descendant of Corvinus, this...
...Michael.
you've been given an enzyme to stop the change.
lt may take a little time for the grogginess to dissipate.
that's enough!
just go and see what's keeping Raze, will you?
l really must apologize.
he's in desperate need of a lesson in manners.
speaking of manners, where are mine? Forgive me.
l'm Lucian.
l need to go.
l need to get back.
there's no going back.
there's no going anywhere.
the Vampires will kill you on sight. Just for being what you are.
one of us.
you are one of us.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
bringing an end to this conflict.
your war, it has nothing to do with me.
my war?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No! No!
Sonja!
they forced you to watch her die.
Sonja.
that's what started the war.
l saw it happen as if l were there.
we were slaves once.
the daylight guardians of the Vampires.
l was born in servitude...
...yet l harbored them no ill will.
l even took a Vampire for my bride.
lt was forbidden our union.
Viktor feared a blending of the species.
feared it so much...
...he killed her.
his own daughter...
...burnt alive...
...for loving me.
this is his war...
...Viktor's...
...and he's spent the last 600 years...
...exterminating my species.
what are they gonna do to Selene?
we have company.
l thought we had a deal.
patience.
Kraven.
these are matters to be discussed in private.
please escort our guests downstairs.
the Council has been destroyed.
soon, you will have it all.
both great covens and an ironclad peace treaty with the Lycans.
who l trust will not be forgotten when the spoils are tabulated.
how do you expect me to assume control now that Viktor's awake?
there's no defeating him. He grows stronger as we speak.
and that is precisely why l need Michael.
lf Viktor were so easy to dispatch...
...you'd have done it yourself centuries ago.
exit shaft! Move it!
son of a bitch!
Oh, shit!
lt's Viktor.
Yes.
and if you had done your job, he'd still be in hibernation.
where the hell is Raze?
ls there another way out?
l guess it didn't occur to you that you'll have to bleed to pull off this coup.
don't even think about leaving.
silver nitrate. Bet you weren't expecting that.
come on! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!
Lucian.
Selene!
Selene!
not yet.
l have to get you out. Viktor's on his way.
and he won't be satisfied until every Lycan's dead.
they'll kill you too, just for helping me.
l know.
l know what started the war.
that's enough. You're coming with me!
l hope l live to see Viktor choke the life from you!
l bet you do.
but let me tell you a little something about your beloved dark father.
he's the one who killed your family.
not the Lycans.
never could follow his own rules.
said he couldn't abide the taste of livestock.
so every once in a while, he went out and gorged himself on human blood.
l kept his secrets...
...cleaned up the mess.
but it was he...
........who crept room to room...
...dispatching everyone close to your heart.
but when he got to you...
...he just couldn't bear the thought of draining you dry.
you, who reminded him so much of his precious Sonja...
...the daughter he condemned to death.
lies.
believe what you want.
now come on.
your place is by my side.
so be it.
bite him!
Half-Vampire...
...half-Lycan...
...but stronger than both.
what the hell are you doing?
you may have killed me...
...cousin.
but my will...
...is done regardless.
where is he?
Where's Kraven?
forgive me, my child.
lt wasn't the Lycans.
lt was you.
leave us.
how could you bear my trust...
...knowing that you'd killed my family?
Yes.
l have taken from you.
but l have given so much more.
ls it not a fair trade, the life l have granted you? The gift of immortality?
and the life of your daughter?
your own flesh and blood?
l loved my daughter!
but the abomination growing in her womb...
...was a betrayal of me and of the coven!
l did what was necessary to protect the species...
...as l am forced to do yet again.
No!
time to die.
though I cannot predict the future...
...the consequences of tonight will reverberate through the halls...
...of both great covens for many years to come.
two Vampire elders have been slain...
...one by my own hand.
soon, Marcus will take the throne.
and a tide of anger and retribution will spill out into the night.
differences will be set aside.
allegiances will be made.
and soon...
...I will become the hunted.
underworld
the war had all but ground to a halt in the blink of an eye.
Lucian, the most feared and ruthless leader ever to rule the Lycan clan...
...had finally been killed.
the Lycan horde scattered to the wind...
...in a single evening of flame and retribution.
victory, it seemed, was in our grasp...
...the very birthright of the Vampires.
nearly 6 centuries had passed since that night.
yet the ancient feud proved unwilling to follow Lucian to the grave.
though Lycans were fewer in number...
...the war itself had become more perilous.
for the moon no longer held her sway.
older, more powerful Lycans were now able to change at will.
the weapons had evolved, but our orders remained the same:
hunt them down and kill them off, one by one.
a most successful campaign.
perhaps too successful.
for those like me, a Death Dealer...
...this signaled the end of an era.
like the weapons of the previous century...
...we, too, would become obsolete.
pity, because I lived for it.
bloods!
lt's all right. lt's all right. You're gonna be okay.
you're acting like a pack of rabid dogs!
and that, gentlemen...
...simply will not do.
not if you expect to defeat the Vampires on their own ground.
not if you expect to survive at all.
Pierce! Taylor!
put some clothes on, will you?
we have a serious problem.
l'll have to run a few tests.
lt's definitely an irradiated fluid of some sort.
ultraviolet ammunition.
daylight, harnessed as a weapon.
you expect me to believe that a mangy animal...
...came up with a bullet specifically engineered to kill Vampires?
no, l'm betting it's military.
something they stole. Some sort of high-tech tracer round.
l don't care where they got these things.
Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel could still be out there.
let's gather the Death Dealers and go back.
absolutely not. Not now. Not for a random incursion.
the Awakening is a few days off, and this house is in unrest as it is.
random? They opened fire on us in full view of the public.
and from what l heard in that tunnel...
you said you didn't see anything.
l know what l heard, and l know what my gut tells me.
there could be dozens of Lycans down there.
who knows, maybe more. Hundreds.
we've hunted them to the brink of extinction.
Kraven's right, Selene.
there's not been a den of that magnitude for centuries.
not since the days of Lucian.
l know that, Kahn.
but l'd rather you prove me wrong by checking it out.
have your men tighten things up.
l'll have Soren assemble a search team.
no, l want to lead the team myself.
absolutely not! Soren will handle it.
hundreds, really?
Viktor would believe me.
l'd never treat you like that.
of course not.
now run along and make sure she's dressed and ready for her guests.
lt's a waste of time, you know.
what is?
l doubt Viktor would want you freezing in here, staring at his tomb for hours.
no, he'd want the Death Dealers out there, scouring every inch of the city.
Kraven. l'll never understand why Viktor left him in charge.
he's a bureaucrat, not a warrior.
we need to get you ready.
for what?
the party.
Amelia's envoy will be here any minute.
Oh, yes.
you should definitely wear this one. lt's perfect.
they were after you.
he's attractive...
...for a human.
who's attractive?
l planned to have you at my side this evening.
take Erika. She's dying to be at your side.
lf you ask me, you take this warrior business far too seriously.
you can't undo the past, no matter how many you kill.
and besides...
...What's the point in being immortal...
...if you deny yourself life's simple pleasures?
do you see this human?
what of him?
l'm beginning to think the Lycans...
blast!
put on something elegant and be quick about it.
Kraven, l'm serious. l think they were following him.
other than food, why would Lycans stalk a human?
any progress?
let's find out.
negative.
you heading home?
Yeah, Nicholas gave me a couple hours off.
by the way...
...he said you did a terrific job tonight with the surgery.
Yeah.
take it easy.
we were ambushed.
death Dealers, three of them.
and the candidate?
we lost him.
you lost him?
look at this mess.
ag rounds. High content.
prevented him from making the change.
no use in digging out the rest. Silver's penetrated his organs.
regeneration's impossible at this point.
let's take these out.
relax.
the Vampires didn't realize you were following a human...
...did they, Raze?
no.
l mean, l don't think so.
you don't think, or you don't know?
I'm not sure.
negative.
l really must have a look at this Michael.
must l do everything myself?
our noble houses may be separated by a great ocean...
...but we are equally committed to the survival of the bloodlines.
and when Amelia arrives to awaken Marcus...
...in just two days' time...
...we shall once again be united as a single coven!
we want to thank our hosts for their generous hospitality.
he comes in, he does his job and then he goes home.
other than that, I don't know what to tell you.
interns work around the clock. We don't have much of a life.
you know where we can find him?
no.
you can try him at home, or you'll have to wait till he gets back.
he's not in some kind of trouble, is he?
this is Michael. I'm not in right now. Please leave a message.
Michael, it's Adam. The police were just in the hospital looking for you.
they were convinced you were involved with a shootout.
I told them there's no way you'd be involved with that...
...but they're looking for you. Right now.
why are they after you?
shit!
Hello, Michael.
what the fuck is going on?
stop the car.
stop the car!
back off!
okay.
okay.
all right.
but you've lost a lot of blood.
lf you don't stop the car, you'll get us both killed.
l'm not screwing around!
neither am l!
shut up and hold on. l'll be fine.
shit!
a second escape. lmpressive.
perhaps Raze wasn't overstating matters.
raze didn't bring back this.
lf Michael is indeed The Carrier, the Vampires could...
relax, old friend.
l've tasted his flesh.
just two days till full moon.
soon, he will be a Lycan.
soon, he will come looking for us.
lt's a shame we don't have more.
positive.
lay still. Your skull's taken a good knock.
you've been unconscious for a while.
do you have any idea why those men were after you?
where am l?
you're safe.
l'm Selene.
so, for once, the rumors were true.
the whole house has been absolutely buzzing about your new pet.
are you going to try to turn him?
of course not.
so why did you bring him here?
he saved my life.
why are you here?
Kraven sent me.
he wants to see you. Now.
this is completely unacceptable!
you go against my orders and spend the night away from the mansion with a human? A human you've since brought back to my house.
as far as l'm concerned, this is still Viktor's house.
look, l don't want to argue.
understand that Michael is somehow important to the Lycans...
so now it's " Michael " !
would you just hear me out?
lt's beyond me why you're so obsessed over this ridiculous theory.
Lucian wouldn't be a bit interested in a human...
...Michael or otherwise.
wait a minute.
you're infatuated with him, aren't you?
now, that's a ridiculous theory.
ls it?
leave us!
l sure hope you never get pissed off with me.
hold on.
check this out.
go ahead. Squeeze off a few.
eject the mag.
you've copied the Lycan rounds. Silver nitrate.
a lethal dose.
they won't dig these out, like our usual rounds.
straight into the bloodstream. Ain't nothing to dig out.
tell me, Kahn.
do you believe Lucian died the way they say?
Kraven telling war stories again?
that's my point.
lt's nothing but an ancient story. His story.
there's not a shred of proof he killed Lucian, only his word.
l've never underestimated Kraven's lust for advancement...
...but Viktor believed him and that's all that matters.
where you going with this anyway?
nowhere.
engaging Death Dealers in public and chasing after some human...
...was not what l had in mind. You were told to set up shop and lay low!
calm yourself, Kraven!
the human doesn't concern you.
and besides, l've laid low for quite long enough.
just keep your men at bay, Lucian.
at least for the time being.
don't force me to regret our arrangement.
you just concentrate on your part.
remember, l've bled for you once already.
without me, you'd have nothing.
you'd be nothing.
of the scores of brave souls who entered Lucian's fortress...
...a single Vampire survived: Kraven...
...who was richly rewarded for not only setting the great blaze...
...but for returning with evidence of the Lycan master's demise...
...the branded skin, cut from Lucian's very arm.
l've been looking for you. He's been bitten.
your human, he's been marked by a Lycan.
did Kraven put you up to this?
no. l saw the wound with my own eyes, l swear it.
but what about the Covenant?
you know it's forbidden!
and ever since he bit me, l've been...
l've been having these hallucinations and these delusions.
all l know is, it feels like my skull is splitting in half.
okay, so a full-grown man bit you?
Jesus.
are you sure this wasn't a dog?
l said, it was a man. lt was a man.
okay, l got it.
he was after me.
and that woman from the subway...
what woman?
haven't you been listening to me? She took me hostage!
all right.
Just...Please...
l'll help you get this all sorted out, all right? l'll be right back.
let go, Michael.
let go.
just calm down, okay? l'm gonna be back in a minute.
that's a promise. All right.
please forgive me...
...but l desperately need your guidance.
kahn wants to see you.
to my knowledge...
...an Awakening has never been attempted by one such as myself.
the elders hold the power to organize their memories and thoughts...
...into a single, cohesive vision...
...a detailed record of their reign.
I can only hope Viktor will hear my plea.
please forgive me, but l desperately need your guidance.
l apologize for awakening you ahead of schedule...
...but l fear we may all be in grave danger.
especially you, my lord, if left in your weakened state.
for l believe that Lucian is alive and well.
here. Now. ln this very city...
...preparing to hit us during the Awakening ceremony.
even more disturbing...
...is that if l'm correct...
...it would mean that Kraven is in league with him.
what's so pressing?
take a look.
Selene!
I want to speak with Selene!
ls that Michael?
ls it Michael?
what the hell is going on?
what's happening to me?
I'm coming out.
lf you go to him, you'll never be welcome in this house again.
now that Viktor's awake, we'll see what he has to say about that.
get in.
look, l warned her. l warned her, but she didn't listen.
l should've told you sooner.
told me what?
her human, Michael...
...he's not a human at all.
he's a Lycan.
what?
what's this ruckus?
never come here again. They'll kill you.
Why? Who are you people?
leave us.
like it or not, you're in the middle of a war that's raged for 1 000 years.
a blood feud between Vampires and Lycans.
werewolves.
consider yourself lucky.
most humans die within an hour of being bitten by an immortal.
the viruses we transmit are deadly.
and if you bit me, l'd become a Vampire instead?
no, you'd die.
no one's ever survived a bite from both species.
by rights, l'd stop the car and kill you myself...
why are you helping me?
l'm not.
l track down and kill your kind.
my only interest is finding out why Lucian wants you so badly.
do you know why l've been awakened, servant?
no, my lord.
but l'll soon find out.
you mean when you find her.
Yes, my lord.
you must let her come to me.
we have much to discuss, Selene and l.
she has shown me a great many disturbing things.
things that will be dealt with soon enough.
this coven has grown weak, decadent.
perhaps l should have left someone else in charge of my affairs.
still...
...her memories...
...are chaotic.
there's no sense of time.
please, my lord, let me summon assistance.
you're in need of rest.
l've rested enough.
what you will do is summon Marcus.
but he still slumbers, my lord.
Amelia and the Council members are arriving tomorrow night...
...to awaken Marcus.
not you, my lord.
you've been awakened a full century ahead of schedule.
that bitch has betrayed me.
now he knows everything she's been obsessing about.
wait.
are you to be trusted?
of course.
meet me in my quarters in 20 minutes.
lt's time l filled you in on a few things.
l'm seeing these things, these hallucinations.
they're not hallucinations, they're memories.
you've been bitten. His memories have been passed to you.
this is one of the places we use for interrogations. lt should be safe.
we own it.
first there was synthetic plasma, now this.
once it's approved, it should be our newest cash crop.
lt's cloned blood.
what are these for?
Lycans are allergic to silver.
lf we don't get our bullets out quickly, they die during questioning.
what do you do with them after?
we put the bullets back in.
how are things progressing?
we're ready.
why do you hate them so much?
l've already told you, we're at war.
so you're just following orders?
why can't you just answer the question?
fine.
something was in the stable tearing our horses to pieces.
l couldn't have saved my mother.
or my sister.
their screams woke me.
my father died outside, trying to fend them off.
l stood at my door...
...about to run to my nieces' room when...
twin girls.
barely six years old.
butchered...
...like animals.
Jesus Christ.
the next thing l knew, l was in his arms.
the war had spilled into our house.
he'd been tracking the Lycans for days.
he drove them off and saved me.
who?
Viktor.
the oldest and strongest of us.
that night, he made me a Vampire.
he gave me the strength to avenge my family.
since then, l've never looked back.
l saw your pictures.
who is the woman? Your wife?
lt may be wise to keep a closer eye on our cousins.
l'll have Raze see to it immediately.
l'm afraid that l'm going to have to place my faith in you, my friend.
time is running short.
I tried to swerve, but he hit us anyway.
he sent us right into the oncoming lane.
when l came to...
...l realized that part of the engine was in the front seat.
and she was pinned there, 6 inches from me...
...in this horrible position.
l think she was in shock because she just...
...kept asking me over and over again if l was all right.
she was more worried about me.
you know, if l knew then what l know now, l could have saved her.
there's no doubt in my mind about that.
but instead she died right there...
...about two minutes before the ambulance arrived.
after that, l didn't see any reason to stick around.
l spent a summer here with my grandfather when l was a kid so...
after l got my degree, l just...
l took off.
l came over here to move on, to forget.
lt seemed like a good idea at the time.
and have you?
moved on?
have you?
l need you to keep what l'm about to tell you under the strictest confidence.
lt can wait.
who started the war?
they did.
or at least that's what we've been led to believe.
digging into the past is forbidden.
l should be heading back.
what about me?
Viktor will know what to do. l'll come back.
l won't stay alone.
you will if you want to live.
no. l want to go with you.
what are you doing?
when the full moon rises tomorrow...
...you will change, you will kill, and you will feed.
lt's unavoidable.
l can't leave you free to roam around. l'm sorry.
a single round won't kill you, but silver prevents transformation.
at least for a few hours.
lf l don't return in time, do yourself a favor.
use it.
yeah?
my lord. She's here.
how could you do this to me? Embarrass me like this?
the entire coven knows that l had plans for us.
there is no us!
you'll go before Viktor...
...and tell him exactly what l tell you to!
from here on out, you'll do as l say.
ls that in any way unclear?
come closer, my child.
outside.
come on, move it.
l've been lost without you, my lord.
constantly hounded by Kraven and his never-ending infatuation.
lt is the oldest story in the book.
he desires the one thing he cannot have.
now, tell me...
...why have you come to believe that Lucian still lives?
Yeah.
l've given you all the proof you need.
lncoherent thoughts and images, nothing more.
which is precisely why the Awakening is performed by an elder.
you do not possess the necessary skills.
but l did see Lucian. l shot him. You must believe me.
the chain has never been broken. Not once.
not in 1 4 centuries.
not since we elders first began to leapfrog through time.
one awake, two asleep. That's the way of it.
lt is Marcus' turn to reign, not mine.
there's been a complication.
but l had no choice.
the coven is in danger, and Michael is the key...
don't
Oh. Yes.
the Lycan.
please.
give me the chance to get proof you require.
fine.
I will leave it to Kraven to collect the proof...
...if there is any.
how could you trust him over me?
because he is not the one who has been tainted by an animal.
l love you...
...like a daughter, but you leave me with no choice.
these rules are in place for a good reason...
...and they are the only reason we have survived this long.
you will not be shown an ounce of leniency.
when Amelia arrives, the Council will convene and decide your fate.
you have broken the chain and the Covenant!
you must be judged!
you should've listened to me and stayed out of this.
now you'll be lucky if l can convince the Council to spare your life.
tell me.
did you have the nerve to cut the skin from his arm, or did Lucian do it?
mark my words.
soon, you'll be seeing things my way.
no one opens this door. Understood?
l can't afford to have my future queen run off with that Lycan again.
shit.
change of plans. Amelia will be picked up by Soren and his team.
that's our job.
not anymore.
why are you helping me?
l'm not. l'm helping me.
what's going on?
the perimeter sensor's been tripped.
we're locking down the mansion.
lt's Selene. She's escaped, to go to him, to Michael.
l want that Lycan's head on a plate.
we need to go.
get down!
go. Go.
jump.
are you fucking kidding me?
any luck?
false alarm.
the dogs would've been all over it if anything had gotten near that fence.
Amelia should have arrived by now.
Yes.
look, l want you to slip off the property and find out what's keeping her.
you've got it.
maybe we should pull over and dose him.
fuck him. He'll be all right. We're almost there.
Oh, shit. He's not gonna make it. Pull over. Pull over!
get the kit.
stick him. Stick him.
my lord.
Viktor wants to speak with you.
my lord.
l sent for Selene...
...not you.
she's defied your orders...
...and fled the mansion, my lord.
your incompetence is becoming most taxing.
lt's not my fault. She's become obsessed...
...thinks that l'm at the core of some ridiculous conspiracy.
and here's my proof.
now, l want you to tell them exactly what you told me.
all right, all right.
we've been searching for someone with a special trait.
a direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus...
...Hungarian, a warlord...
...who came to power in the early seasons of the fifth century.
just in time to watch a plague ravage his village.
he alone survived.
somehow, his body was able to change the disease...
...mold it to his benefit.
he became the first true immortal.
and years later, he fathered at least two children...
...who inherited this same trait.
the sons of the Corvinus clan.
one bitten by bat, one by wolf...
...one to walk the lonely road of mortality as a human.
lt's a ridiculous legend. Nothing!
that may be...
...but our species do have a common ancestor.
a mutation of the original virus...
...is directly linked to his bloodline.
there is a descendant of Corvinus lying there........
...not three feet from you.
Yes.
but he's already a Vampire. We needed a pure source...
...untainted. An exact duplicate of the original virus...
...which we learned...
...was hidden away in the genetic code of his human descendants...
...and passed along in its latent form...
...down through the ages...
...all the way to Michael Corvin.
for years, we tried to combine their bloodlines.
and for years we failed.
it was useless.
even at the cellular level, our species seemed destined to destroy each other.
that is, until we found Michael.
the Corvinus strain allows for a perfect union.
a triple-celled platelet...
...which holds unspeakable power.
there can be no such union.
and to speak of it is heresy.
we'll see.
once Lucian has injected himself with Michael's blood.
Lucian is dead.
according to whom?
l need you to do something for me.
l can assure you, my child...
...Kraven will pay with his life.
soon, this house will lie in ruins.
not before you.
no, No, No, wait. Wait.
you and you alone will know the truth of this.
lf Lucian was able to get his hands on the blood of a Pure-Born...
...a powerful elder like Amelia...
...or yourself...
...and inject it along with Michael's blood...
abomination.
Half-Vampire...
...half-Lycan, but stronger than both.
l need to speak with Kahn.
my lord...
...the Council members have been assassinated.
what of Amelia?
they bled her dry.
lt has already begun.
l'm sorry l doubted you.
fear not, my child, absolution will be yours...
...the moment you kill the descendant of Corvinus, this...
...Michael.
you've been given an enzyme to stop the change.
lt may take a little time for the grogginess to dissipate.
that's enough!
just go and see what's keeping Raze, will you?
l really must apologize.
he's in desperate need of a lesson in manners.
speaking of manners, where are mine? Forgive me.
l'm Lucian.
l need to go.
l need to get back.
there's no going back.
there's no going anywhere.
the Vampires will kill you on sight. Just for being what you are.
one of us.
you are one of us.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
bringing an end to this conflict.
your war, it has nothing to do with me.
my war?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No! No!
Sonja!
they forced you to watch her die.
Sonja.
that's what started the war.
l saw it happen as if l were there.
we were slaves once.
the daylight guardians of the Vampires.
l was born in servitude...
...yet l harbored them no ill will.
l even took a Vampire for my bride.
lt was forbidden our union.
Viktor feared a blending of the species.
feared it so much...
...he killed her.
his own daughter...
...burnt alive...
...for loving me.
this is his war...
...Viktor's...
...and he's spent the last 600 years...
...exterminating my species.
what are they gonna do to Selene?
we have company.
l thought we had a deal.
patience.
Kraven.
these are matters to be discussed in private.
please escort our guests downstairs.
the Council has been destroyed.
soon, you will have it all.
both great covens and an ironclad peace treaty with the Lycans.
who l trust will not be forgotten when the spoils are tabulated.
how do you expect me to assume control now that Viktor's awake?
there's no defeating him. He grows stronger as we speak.
and that is precisely why l need Michael.
lf Viktor were so easy to dispatch...
...you'd have done it yourself centuries ago.
exit shaft! Move it!
son of a bitch!
Oh, shit!
lt's Viktor.
Yes.
and if you had done your job, he'd still be in hibernation.
where the hell is Raze?
ls there another way out?
l guess it didn't occur to you that you'll have to bleed to pull off this coup.
don't even think about leaving.
silver nitrate. Bet you weren't expecting that.
come on! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!
Lucian.
Selene!
Selene!
not yet.
l have to get you out. Viktor's on his way.
and he won't be satisfied until every Lycan's dead.
they'll kill you too, just for helping me.
l know.
l know what started the war.
that's enough. You're coming with me!
l hope l live to see Viktor choke the life from you!
l bet you do.
but let me tell you a little something about your beloved dark father.
he's the one who killed your family.
not the Lycans.
never could follow his own rules.
said he couldn't abide the taste of livestock.
so every once in a while, he went out and gorged himself on human blood.
l kept his secrets...
...cleaned up the mess.
but it was he...
........who crept room to room...
...dispatching everyone close to your heart.
but when he got to you...
...he just couldn't bear the thought of draining you dry.
you, who reminded him so much of his precious Sonja...
...the daughter he condemned to death.
lies.
believe what you want.
now come on.
your place is by my side.
so be it.
bite him!
Half-Vampire...
...half-Lycan...
...but stronger than both.
what the hell are you doing?
you may have killed me...
...cousin.
but my will...
...is done regardless.
where is he?
Where's Kraven?
forgive me, my child.
lt wasn't the Lycans.
lt was you.
leave us.
how could you bear my trust...
...knowing that you'd killed my family?
Yes.
l have taken from you.
but l have given so much more.
ls it not a fair trade, the life l have granted you? The gift of immortality?
and the life of your daughter?
your own flesh and blood?
l loved my daughter!
but the abomination growing in her womb...
...was a betrayal of me and of the coven!
l did what was necessary to protect the species...
...as l am forced to do yet again.
No!
time to die.
though I cannot predict the future...
...the consequences of tonight will reverberate through the halls...
...of both great covens for many years to come.
two Vampire elders have been slain...
...one by my own hand.
soon, Marcus will take the throne.
and a tide of anger and retribution will spill out into the night.
differences will be set aside.
allegiances will be made.
and soon...
...I will become the hunted.
underworld
the war had all but ground to a halt in the blink of an eye.
Lucian, the most feared and ruthless leader ever to rule the Lycan clan...
...had finally been killed.
the Lycan horde scattered to the wind...
...in a single evening of flame and retribution.
victory, it seemed, was in our grasp...
...the very birthright of the Vampires.
nearly 6 centuries had passed since that night.
yet the ancient feud proved unwilling to follow Lucian to the grave.
though Lycans were fewer in number...
...the war itself had become more perilous.
for the moon no longer held her sway.
older, more powerful Lycans were now able to change at will.
the weapons had evolved, but our orders remained the same:
hunt them down and kill them off, one by one.
a most successful campaign.
perhaps too successful.
for those like me, a Death Dealer...
...this signaled the end of an era.
like the weapons of the previous century...
...we, too, would become obsolete.
pity, because I lived for it.
bloods!
lt's all right. lt's all right. You're gonna be okay.
you're acting like a pack of rabid dogs!
and that, gentlemen...
...simply will not do.
not if you expect to defeat the Vampires on their own ground.
not if you expect to survive at all.
Pierce! Taylor!
put some clothes on, will you?
we have a serious problem.
l'll have to run a few tests.
lt's definitely an irradiated fluid of some sort.
ultraviolet ammunition.
daylight, harnessed as a weapon.
you expect me to believe that a mangy animal...
...came up with a bullet specifically engineered to kill Vampires?
no, l'm betting it's military.
something they stole. Some sort of high-tech tracer round.
l don't care where they got these things.
Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel could still be out there.
let's gather the Death Dealers and go back.
absolutely not. Not now. Not for a random incursion.
the Awakening is a few days off, and this house is in unrest as it is.
random? They opened fire on us in full view of the public.
and from what l heard in that tunnel...
you said you didn't see anything.
l know what l heard, and l know what my gut tells me.
there could be dozens of Lycans down there.
who knows, maybe more. Hundreds.
we've hunted them to the brink of extinction.
Kraven's right, Selene.
there's not been a den of that magnitude for centuries.
not since the days of Lucian.
l know that, Kahn.
but l'd rather you prove me wrong by checking it out.
have your men tighten things up.
l'll have Soren assemble a search team.
no, l want to lead the team myself.
absolutely not! Soren will handle it.
hundreds, really?
Viktor would believe me.
l'd never treat you like that.
of course not.
now run along and make sure she's dressed and ready for her guests.
lt's a waste of time, you know.
what is?
l doubt Viktor would want you freezing in here, staring at his tomb for hours.
no, he'd want the Death Dealers out there, scouring every inch of the city.
Kraven. l'll never understand why Viktor left him in charge.
he's a bureaucrat, not a warrior.
we need to get you ready.
for what?
the party.
Amelia's envoy will be here any minute.
Oh, yes.
you should definitely wear this one. lt's perfect.
they were after you.
he's attractive...
...for a human.
who's attractive?
l planned to have you at my side this evening.
take Erika. She's dying to be at your side.
lf you ask me, you take this warrior business far too seriously.
you can't undo the past, no matter how many you kill.
and besides...
...What's the point in being immortal...
...if you deny yourself life's simple pleasures?
do you see this human?
what of him?
l'm beginning to think the Lycans...
blast!
put on something elegant and be quick about it.
Kraven, l'm serious. l think they were following him.
other than food, why would Lycans stalk a human?
any progress?
let's find out.
negative.
you heading home?
Yeah, Nicholas gave me a couple hours off.
by the way...
...he said you did a terrific job tonight with the surgery.
Yeah.
take it easy.
we were ambushed.
death Dealers, three of them.
and the candidate?
we lost him.
you lost him?
look at this mess.
ag rounds. High content.
prevented him from making the change.
no use in digging out the rest. Silver's penetrated his organs.
regeneration's impossible at this point.
let's take these out.
relax.
the Vampires didn't realize you were following a human...
...did they, Raze?
no.
l mean, l don't think so.
you don't think, or you don't know?
I'm not sure.
negative.
l really must have a look at this Michael.
must l do everything myself?
our noble houses may be separated by a great ocean...
...but we are equally committed to the survival of the bloodlines.
and when Amelia arrives to awaken Marcus...
...in just two days' time...
...we shall once again be united as a single coven!
we want to thank our hosts for their generous hospitality.
he comes in, he does his job and then he goes home.
other than that, I don't know what to tell you.
interns work around the clock. We don't have much of a life.
you know where we can find him?
no.
you can try him at home, or you'll have to wait till he gets back.
he's not in some kind of trouble, is he?
this is Michael. I'm not in right now. Please leave a message.
Michael, it's Adam. The police were just in the hospital looking for you.
they were convinced you were involved with a shootout.
I told them there's no way you'd be involved with that...
...but they're looking for you. Right now.
why are they after you?
shit!
Hello, Michael.
what the fuck is going on?
stop the car.
stop the car!
back off!
okay.
okay.
all right.
but you've lost a lot of blood.
lf you don't stop the car, you'll get us both killed.
l'm not screwing around!
neither am l!
shut up and hold on. l'll be fine.
shit!
a second escape. lmpressive.
perhaps Raze wasn't overstating matters.
raze didn't bring back this.
lf Michael is indeed The Carrier, the Vampires could...
relax, old friend.
l've tasted his flesh.
just two days till full moon.
soon, he will be a Lycan.
soon, he will come looking for us.
lt's a shame we don't have more.
positive.
lay still. Your skull's taken a good knock.
you've been unconscious for a while.
do you have any idea why those men were after you?
where am l?
you're safe.
l'm Selene.
so, for once, the rumors were true.
the whole house has been absolutely buzzing about your new pet.
are you going to try to turn him?
of course not.
so why did you bring him here?
he saved my life.
why are you here?
Kraven sent me.
he wants to see you. Now.
this is completely unacceptable!
you go against my orders and spend the night away from the mansion with a human? A human you've since brought back to my house.
as far as l'm concerned, this is still Viktor's house.
look, l don't want to argue.
understand that Michael is somehow important to the Lycans...
so now it's " Michael " !
would you just hear me out?
lt's beyond me why you're so obsessed over this ridiculous theory.
Lucian wouldn't be a bit interested in a human...
...Michael or otherwise.
wait a minute.
you're infatuated with him, aren't you?
now, that's a ridiculous theory.
ls it?
leave us!
l sure hope you never get pissed off with me.
hold on.
check this out.
go ahead. Squeeze off a few.
eject the mag.
you've copied the Lycan rounds. Silver nitrate.
a lethal dose.
they won't dig these out, like our usual rounds.
straight into the bloodstream. Ain't nothing to dig out.
tell me, Kahn.
do you believe Lucian died the way they say?
Kraven telling war stories again?
that's my point.
lt's nothing but an ancient story. His story.
there's not a shred of proof he killed Lucian, only his word.
l've never underestimated Kraven's lust for advancement...
...but Viktor believed him and that's all that matters.
where you going with this anyway?
nowhere.
engaging Death Dealers in public and chasing after some human...
...was not what l had in mind. You were told to set up shop and lay low!
calm yourself, Kraven!
the human doesn't concern you.
and besides, l've laid low for quite long enough.
just keep your men at bay, Lucian.
at least for the time being.
don't force me to regret our arrangement.
you just concentrate on your part.
remember, l've bled for you once already.
without me, you'd have nothing.
you'd be nothing.
of the scores of brave souls who entered Lucian's fortress...
...a single Vampire survived: Kraven...
...who was richly rewarded for not only setting the great blaze...
...but for returning with evidence of the Lycan master's demise...
...the branded skin, cut from Lucian's very arm.
l've been looking for you. He's been bitten.
your human, he's been marked by a Lycan.
did Kraven put you up to this?
no. l saw the wound with my own eyes, l swear it.
but what about the Covenant?
you know it's forbidden!
and ever since he bit me, l've been...
l've been having these hallucinations and these delusions.
all l know is, it feels like my skull is splitting in half.
okay, so a full-grown man bit you?
Jesus.
are you sure this wasn't a dog?
l said, it was a man. lt was a man.
okay, l got it.
he was after me.
and that woman from the subway...
what woman?
haven't you been listening to me? She took me hostage!
all right.
Just...Please...
l'll help you get this all sorted out, all right? l'll be right back.
let go, Michael.
let go.
just calm down, okay? l'm gonna be back in a minute.
that's a promise. All right.
please forgive me...
...but l desperately need your guidance.
kahn wants to see you.
to my knowledge...
...an Awakening has never been attempted by one such as myself.
the elders hold the power to organize their memories and thoughts...
...into a single, cohesive vision...
...a detailed record of their reign.
I can only hope Viktor will hear my plea.
please forgive me, but l desperately need your guidance.
l apologize for awakening you ahead of schedule...
...but l fear we may all be in grave danger.
especially you, my lord, if left in your weakened state.
for l believe that Lucian is alive and well.
here. Now. ln this very city...
...preparing to hit us during the Awakening ceremony.
even more disturbing...
...is that if l'm correct...
...it would mean that Kraven is in league with him.
what's so pressing?
take a look.
Selene!
I want to speak with Selene!
ls that Michael?
ls it Michael?
what the hell is going on?
what's happening to me?
I'm coming out.
lf you go to him, you'll never be welcome in this house again.
now that Viktor's awake, we'll see what he has to say about that.
get in.
look, l warned her. l warned her, but she didn't listen.
l should've told you sooner.
told me what?
her human, Michael...
...he's not a human at all.
he's a Lycan.
what?
what's this ruckus?
never come here again. They'll kill you.
Why? Who are you people?
leave us.
like it or not, you're in the middle of a war that's raged for 1 000 years.
a blood feud between Vampires and Lycans.
werewolves.
consider yourself lucky.
most humans die within an hour of being bitten by an immortal.
the viruses we transmit are deadly.
and if you bit me, l'd become a Vampire instead?
no, you'd die.
no one's ever survived a bite from both species.
by rights, l'd stop the car and kill you myself...
why are you helping me?
l'm not.
l track down and kill your kind.
my only interest is finding out why Lucian wants you so badly.
do you know why l've been awakened, servant?
no, my lord.
but l'll soon find out.
you mean when you find her.
Yes, my lord.
you must let her come to me.
we have much to discuss, Selene and l.
she has shown me a great many disturbing things.
things that will be dealt with soon enough.
this coven has grown weak, decadent.
perhaps l should have left someone else in charge of my affairs.
still...
...her memories...
...are chaotic.
there's no sense of time.
please, my lord, let me summon assistance.
you're in need of rest.
l've rested enough.
what you will do is summon Marcus.
but he still slumbers, my lord.
Amelia and the Council members are arriving tomorrow night...
...to awaken Marcus.
not you, my lord.
you've been awakened a full century ahead of schedule.
that bitch has betrayed me.
now he knows everything she's been obsessing about.
wait.
are you to be trusted?
of course.
meet me in my quarters in 20 minutes.
lt's time l filled you in on a few things.
l'm seeing these things, these hallucinations.
they're not hallucinations, they're memories.
you've been bitten. His memories have been passed to you.
this is one of the places we use for interrogations. lt should be safe.
we own it.
first there was synthetic plasma, now this.
once it's approved, it should be our newest cash crop.
lt's cloned blood.
what are these for?
Lycans are allergic to silver.
lf we don't get our bullets out quickly, they die during questioning.
what do you do with them after?
we put the bullets back in.
how are things progressing?
we're ready.
why do you hate them so much?
l've already told you, we're at war.
so you're just following orders?
why can't you just answer the question?
fine.
something was in the stable tearing our horses to pieces.
l couldn't have saved my mother.
or my sister.
their screams woke me.
my father died outside, trying to fend them off.
l stood at my door...
...about to run to my nieces' room when...
twin girls.
barely six years old.
butchered...
...like animals.
Jesus Christ.
the next thing l knew, l was in his arms.
the war had spilled into our house.
he'd been tracking the Lycans for days.
he drove them off and saved me.
who?
Viktor.
the oldest and strongest of us.
that night, he made me a Vampire.
he gave me the strength to avenge my family.
since then, l've never looked back.
l saw your pictures.
who is the woman? Your wife?
lt may be wise to keep a closer eye on our cousins.
l'll have Raze see to it immediately.
l'm afraid that l'm going to have to place my faith in you, my friend.
time is running short.
I tried to swerve, but he hit us anyway.
he sent us right into the oncoming lane.
when l came to...
...l realized that part of the engine was in the front seat.
and she was pinned there, 6 inches from me...
...in this horrible position.
l think she was in shock because she just...
...kept asking me over and over again if l was all right.
she was more worried about me.
you know, if l knew then what l know now, l could have saved her.
there's no doubt in my mind about that.
but instead she died right there...
...about two minutes before the ambulance arrived.
after that, l didn't see any reason to stick around.
l spent a summer here with my grandfather when l was a kid so...
after l got my degree, l just...
l took off.
l came over here to move on, to forget.
lt seemed like a good idea at the time.
and have you?
moved on?
have you?
l need you to keep what l'm about to tell you under the strictest confidence.
lt can wait.
who started the war?
they did.
or at least that's what we've been led to believe.
digging into the past is forbidden.
l should be heading back.
what about me?
Viktor will know what to do. l'll come back.
l won't stay alone.
you will if you want to live.
no. l want to go with you.
what are you doing?
when the full moon rises tomorrow...
...you will change, you will kill, and you will feed.
lt's unavoidable.
l can't leave you free to roam around. l'm sorry.
a single round won't kill you, but silver prevents transformation.
at least for a few hours.
lf l don't return in time, do yourself a favor.
use it.
yeah?
my lord. She's here.
how could you do this to me? Embarrass me like this?
the entire coven knows that l had plans for us.
there is no us!
you'll go before Viktor...
...and tell him exactly what l tell you to!
from here on out, you'll do as l say.
ls that in any way unclear?
come closer, my child.
outside.
come on, move it.
l've been lost without you, my lord.
constantly hounded by Kraven and his never-ending infatuation.
lt is the oldest story in the book.
he desires the one thing he cannot have.
now, tell me...
...why have you come to believe that Lucian still lives?
Yeah.
l've given you all the proof you need.
lncoherent thoughts and images, nothing more.
which is precisely why the Awakening is performed by an elder.
you do not possess the necessary skills.
but l did see Lucian. l shot him. You must believe me.
the chain has never been broken. Not once.
not in 1 4 centuries.
not since we elders first began to leapfrog through time.
one awake, two asleep. That's the way of it.
lt is Marcus' turn to reign, not mine.
there's been a complication.
but l had no choice.
the coven is in danger, and Michael is the key...
don't
Oh. Yes.
the Lycan.
please.
give me the chance to get proof you require.
fine.
I will leave it to Kraven to collect the proof...
...if there is any.
how could you trust him over me?
because he is not the one who has been tainted by an animal.
l love you...
...like a daughter, but you leave me with no choice.
these rules are in place for a good reason...
...and they are the only reason we have survived this long.
you will not be shown an ounce of leniency.
when Amelia arrives, the Council will convene and decide your fate.
you have broken the chain and the Covenant!
you must be judged!
you should've listened to me and stayed out of this.
now you'll be lucky if l can convince the Council to spare your life.
tell me.
did you have the nerve to cut the skin from his arm, or did Lucian do it?
mark my words.
soon, you'll be seeing things my way.
no one opens this door. Understood?
l can't afford to have my future queen run off with that Lycan again.
shit.
change of plans. Amelia will be picked up by Soren and his team.
that's our job.
not anymore.
why are you helping me?
l'm not. l'm helping me.
what's going on?
the perimeter sensor's been tripped.
we're locking down the mansion.
lt's Selene. She's escaped, to go to him, to Michael.
l want that Lycan's head on a plate.
we need to go.
get down!
go. Go.
jump.
are you fucking kidding me?
any luck?
false alarm.
the dogs would've been all over it if anything had gotten near that fence.
Amelia should have arrived by now.
Yes.
look, l want you to slip off the property and find out what's keeping her.
you've got it.
maybe we should pull over and dose him.
fuck him. He'll be all right. We're almost there.
Oh, shit. He's not gonna make it. Pull over. Pull over!
get the kit.
stick him. Stick him.
my lord.
Viktor wants to speak with you.
my lord.
l sent for Selene...
...not you.
she's defied your orders...
...and fled the mansion, my lord.
your incompetence is becoming most taxing.
lt's not my fault. She's become obsessed...
...thinks that l'm at the core of some ridiculous conspiracy.
and here's my proof.
now, l want you to tell them exactly what you told me.
all right, all right.
we've been searching for someone with a special trait.
a direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus...
...Hungarian, a warlord...
...who came to power in the early seasons of the fifth century.
just in time to watch a plague ravage his village.
he alone survived.
somehow, his body was able to change the disease...
...mold it to his benefit.
he became the first true immortal.
and years later, he fathered at least two children...
...who inherited this same trait.
the sons of the Corvinus clan.
one bitten by bat, one by wolf...
...one to walk the lonely road of mortality as a human.
lt's a ridiculous legend. Nothing!
that may be...
...but our species do have a common ancestor.
a mutation of the original virus...
...is directly linked to his bloodline.
there is a descendant of Corvinus lying there........
...not three feet from you.
Yes.
but he's already a Vampire. We needed a pure source...
...untainted. An exact duplicate of the original virus...
...which we learned...
...was hidden away in the genetic code of his human descendants...
...and passed along in its latent form...
...down through the ages...
...all the way to Michael Corvin.
for years, we tried to combine their bloodlines.
and for years we failed.
it was useless.
even at the cellular level, our species seemed destined to destroy each other.
that is, until we found Michael.
the Corvinus strain allows for a perfect union.
a triple-celled platelet...
...which holds unspeakable power.
there can be no such union.
and to speak of it is heresy.
we'll see.
once Lucian has injected himself with Michael's blood.
Lucian is dead.
according to whom?
l need you to do something for me.
l can assure you, my child...
...Kraven will pay with his life.
soon, this house will lie in ruins.
not before you.
no, No, No, wait. Wait.
you and you alone will know the truth of this.
lf Lucian was able to get his hands on the blood of a Pure-Born...
...a powerful elder like Amelia...
...or yourself...
...and inject it along with Michael's blood...
abomination.
Half-Vampire...
...half-Lycan, but stronger than both.
l need to speak with Kahn.
my lord...
...the Council members have been assassinated.
what of Amelia?
they bled her dry.
lt has already begun.
l'm sorry l doubted you.
fear not, my child, absolution will be yours...
...the moment you kill the descendant of Corvinus, this...
...Michael.
you've been given an enzyme to stop the change.
lt may take a little time for the grogginess to dissipate.
that's enough!
just go and see what's keeping Raze, will you?
l really must apologize.
he's in desperate need of a lesson in manners.
speaking of manners, where are mine? Forgive me.
l'm Lucian.
l need to go.
l need to get back.
there's no going back.
there's no going anywhere.
the Vampires will kill you on sight. Just for being what you are.
one of us.
you are one of us.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
bringing an end to this conflict.
your war, it has nothing to do with me.
my war?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No! No!
Sonja!
they forced you to watch her die.
Sonja.
that's what started the war.
l saw it happen as if l were there.
we were slaves once.
the daylight guardians of the Vampires.
l was born in servitude...
...yet l harbored them no ill will.
l even took a Vampire for my bride.
lt was forbidden our union.
Viktor feared a blending of the species.
feared it so much...
...he killed her.
his own daughter...
...burnt alive...
...for loving me.
this is his war...
...Viktor's...
...and he's spent the last 600 years...
...exterminating my species.
what are they gonna do to Selene?
we have company.
l thought we had a deal.
patience.
Kraven.
these are matters to be discussed in private.
please escort our guests downstairs.
the Council has been destroyed.
soon, you will have it all.
both great covens and an ironclad peace treaty with the Lycans.
who l trust will not be forgotten when the spoils are tabulated.
how do you expect me to assume control now that Viktor's awake?
there's no defeating him. He grows stronger as we speak.
and that is precisely why l need Michael.
lf Viktor were so easy to dispatch...
...you'd have done it yourself centuries ago.
exit shaft! Move it!
son of a bitch!
Oh, shit!
lt's Viktor.
Yes.
and if you had done your job, he'd still be in hibernation.
where the hell is Raze?
ls there another way out?
l guess it didn't occur to you that you'll have to bleed to pull off this coup.
don't even think about leaving.
silver nitrate. Bet you weren't expecting that.
come on! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!
Lucian.
Selene!
Selene!
not yet.
l have to get you out. Viktor's on his way.
and he won't be satisfied until every Lycan's dead.
they'll kill you too, just for helping me.
l know.
l know what started the war.
that's enough. You're coming with me!
l hope l live to see Viktor choke the life from you!
l bet you do.
but let me tell you a little something about your beloved dark father.
he's the one who killed your family.
not the Lycans.
never could follow his own rules.
said he couldn't abide the taste of livestock.
so every once in a while, he went out and gorged himself on human blood.
l kept his secrets...
...cleaned up the mess.
but it was he...
........who crept room to room...
...dispatching everyone close to your heart.
but when he got to you...
...he just couldn't bear the thought of draining you dry.
you, who reminded him so much of his precious Sonja...
...the daughter he condemned to death.
lies.
believe what you want.
now come on.
your place is by my side.
so be it.
bite him!
Half-Vampire...
...half-Lycan...
...but stronger than both.
what the hell are you doing?
you may have killed me...
...cousin.
but my will...
...is done regardless.
where is he?
Where's Kraven?
forgive me, my child.
lt wasn't the Lycans.
lt was you.
leave us.
how could you bear my trust...
...knowing that you'd killed my family?
Yes.
l have taken from you.
but l have given so much more.
ls it not a fair trade, the life l have granted you? The gift of immortality?
and the life of your daughter?
your own flesh and blood?
l loved my daughter!
but the abomination growing in her womb...
...was a betrayal of me and of the coven!
l did what was necessary to protect the species...
...as l am forced to do yet again.
No!
time to die.
though I cannot predict the future...
...the consequences of tonight will reverberate through the halls...
...of both great covens for many years to come.
two Vampire elders have been slain...
...one by my own hand.
soon, Marcus will take the throne.
and a tide of anger and retribution will spill out into the night.
differences will be set aside.
allegiances will be made.
and soon...
...I will become the hunted.
underworld
the war had all but ground to a halt in the blink of an eye.
Lucian, the most feared and ruthless leader ever to rule the Lycan clan...
...had finally been killed.
the Lycan horde scattered to the wind...
...in a single evening of flame and retribution.
victory, it seemed, was in our grasp...
...the very birthright of the Vampires.
nearly 6 centuries had passed since that night.
yet the ancient feud proved unwilling to follow Lucian to the grave.
though Lycans were fewer in number...
...the war itself had become more perilous.
for the moon no longer held her sway.
older, more powerful Lycans were now able to change at will.
the weapons had evolved, but our orders remained the same:
hunt them down and kill them off, one by one.
a most successful campaign.
perhaps too successful.
for those like me, a Death Dealer...
...this signaled the end of an era.
like the weapons of the previous century...
...we, too, would become obsolete.
pity, because I lived for it.
bloods!
lt's all right. lt's all right. You're gonna be okay.
you're acting like a pack of rabid dogs!
and that, gentlemen...
...simply will not do.
not if you expect to defeat the Vampires on their own ground.
not if you expect to survive at all.
Pierce! Taylor!
put some clothes on, will you?
we have a serious problem.
l'll have to run a few tests.
lt's definitely an irradiated fluid of some sort.
ultraviolet ammunition.
daylight, harnessed as a weapon.
you expect me to believe that a mangy animal...
...came up with a bullet specifically engineered to kill Vampires?
no, l'm betting it's military.
something they stole. Some sort of high-tech tracer round.
l don't care where they got these things.
Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel could still be out there.
let's gather the Death Dealers and go back.
absolutely not. Not now. Not for a random incursion.
the Awakening is a few days off, and this house is in unrest as it is.
random? They opened fire on us in full view of the public.
and from what l heard in that tunnel...
you said you didn't see anything.
l know what l heard, and l know what my gut tells me.
there could be dozens of Lycans down there.
who knows, maybe more. Hundreds.
we've hunted them to the brink of extinction.
Kraven's right, Selene.
there's not been a den of that magnitude for centuries.
not since the days of Lucian.
l know that, Kahn.
but l'd rather you prove me wrong by checking it out.
have your men tighten things up.
l'll have Soren assemble a search team.
no, l want to lead the team myself.
absolutely not! Soren will handle it.
hundreds, really?
Viktor would believe me.
l'd never treat you like that.
of course not.
now run along and make sure she's dressed and ready for her guests.
lt's a waste of time, you know.
what is?
l doubt Viktor would want you freezing in here, staring at his tomb for hours.
no, he'd want the Death Dealers out there, scouring every inch of the city.
Kraven. l'll never understand why Viktor left him in charge.
he's a bureaucrat, not a warrior.
we need to get you ready.
for what?
the party.
Amelia's envoy will be here any minute.
Oh, yes.
you should definitely wear this one. lt's perfect.
they were after you.
he's attractive...
...for a human.
who's attractive?
l planned to have you at my side this evening.
take Erika. She's dying to be at your side.
lf you ask me, you take this warrior business far too seriously.
you can't undo the past, no matter how many you kill.
and besides...
...What's the point in being immortal...
...if you deny yourself life's simple pleasures?
do you see this human?
what of him?
l'm beginning to think the Lycans...
blast!
put on something elegant and be quick about it.
Kraven, l'm serious. l think they were following him.
other than food, why would Lycans stalk a human?
any progress?
let's find out.
negative.
you heading home?
Yeah, Nicholas gave me a couple hours off.
by the way...
...he said you did a terrific job tonight with the surgery.
Yeah.
take it easy.
we were ambushed.
death Dealers, three of them.
and the candidate?
we lost him.
you lost him?
look at this mess.
ag rounds. High content.
prevented him from making the change.
no use in digging out the rest. Silver's penetrated his organs.
regeneration's impossible at this point.
let's take these out.
relax.
the Vampires didn't realize you were following a human...
...did they, Raze?
no.
l mean, l don't think so.
you don't think, or you don't know?
I'm not sure.
negative.
l really must have a look at this Michael.
must l do everything myself?
our noble houses may be separated by a great ocean...
...but we are equally committed to the survival of the bloodlines.
and when Amelia arrives to awaken Marcus...
...in just two days' time...
...we shall once again be united as a single coven!
we want to thank our hosts for their generous hospitality.
he comes in, he does his job and then he goes home.
other than that, I don't know what to tell you.
interns work around the clock. We don't have much of a life.
you know where we can find him?
no.
you can try him at home, or you'll have to wait till he gets back.
he's not in some kind of trouble, is he?
this is Michael. I'm not in right now. Please leave a message.
Michael, it's Adam. The police were just in the hospital looking for you.
they were convinced you were involved with a shootout.
I told them there's no way you'd be involved with that...
...but they're looking for you. Right now.
why are they after you?
shit!
Hello, Michael.
what the fuck is going on?
stop the car.
stop the car!
back off!
okay.
okay.
all right.
but you've lost a lot of blood.
lf you don't stop the car, you'll get us both killed.
l'm not screwing around!
neither am l!
shut up and hold on. l'll be fine.
shit!
a second escape. lmpressive.
perhaps Raze wasn't overstating matters.
raze didn't bring back this.
lf Michael is indeed The Carrier, the Vampires could...
relax, old friend.
l've tasted his flesh.
just two days till full moon.
soon, he will be a Lycan.
soon, he will come looking for us.
lt's a shame we don't have more.
positive.
lay still. Your skull's taken a good knock.
you've been unconscious for a while.
do you have any idea why those men were after you?
where am l?
you're safe.
l'm Selene.
so, for once, the rumors were true.
the whole house has been absolutely buzzing about your new pet.
are you going to try to turn him?
of course not.
so why did you bring him here?
he saved my life.
why are you here?
Kraven sent me.
he wants to see you. Now.
this is completely unacceptable!
you go against my orders and spend the night away from the mansion with a human? A human you've since brought back to my house.
as far as l'm concerned, this is still Viktor's house.
look, l don't want to argue.
understand that Michael is somehow important to the Lycans...
so now it's " Michael " !
would you just hear me out?
lt's beyond me why you're so obsessed over this ridiculous theory.
Lucian wouldn't be a bit interested in a human...
...Michael or otherwise.
wait a minute.
you're infatuated with him, aren't you?
now, that's a ridiculous theory.
ls it?
leave us!
l sure hope you never get pissed off with me.
hold on.
check this out.
go ahead. Squeeze off a few.
eject the mag.
you've copied the Lycan rounds. Silver nitrate.
a lethal dose.
they won't dig these out, like our usual rounds.
straight into the bloodstream. Ain't nothing to dig out.
tell me, Kahn.
do you believe Lucian died the way they say?
Kraven telling war stories again?
that's my point.
lt's nothing but an ancient story. His story.
there's not a shred of proof he killed Lucian, only his word.
l've never underestimated Kraven's lust for advancement...
...but Viktor believed him and that's all that matters.
where you going with this anyway?
nowhere.
engaging Death Dealers in public and chasing after some human...
...was not what l had in mind. You were told to set up shop and lay low!
calm yourself, Kraven!
the human doesn't concern you.
and besides, l've laid low for quite long enough.
just keep your men at bay, Lucian.
at least for the time being.
don't force me to regret our arrangement.
you just concentrate on your part.
remember, l've bled for you once already.
without me, you'd have nothing.
you'd be nothing.
of the scores of brave souls who entered Lucian's fortress...
...a single Vampire survived: Kraven...
...who was richly rewarded for not only setting the great blaze...
...but for returning with evidence of the Lycan master's demise...
...the branded skin, cut from Lucian's very arm.
l've been looking for you. He's been bitten.
your human, he's been marked by a Lycan.
did Kraven put you up to this?
no. l saw the wound with my own eyes, l swear it.
but what about the Covenant?
you know it's forbidden!
and ever since he bit me, l've been...
l've been having these hallucinations and these delusions.
all l know is, it feels like my skull is splitting in half.
okay, so a full-grown man bit you?
Jesus.
are you sure this wasn't a dog?
l said, it was a man. lt was a man.
okay, l got it.
he was after me.
and that woman from the subway...
what woman?
haven't you been listening to me? She took me hostage!
all right.
Just...Please...
l'll help you get this all sorted out, all right? l'll be right back.
let go, Michael.
let go.
just calm down, okay? l'm gonna be back in a minute.
that's a promise. All right.
please forgive me...
...but l desperately need your guidance.
kahn wants to see you.
to my knowledge...
...an Awakening has never been attempted by one such as myself.
the elders hold the power to organize their memories and thoughts...
...into a single, cohesive vision...
...a detailed record of their reign.
I can only hope Viktor will hear my plea.
please forgive me, but l desperately need your guidance.
l apologize for awakening you ahead of schedule...
...but l fear we may all be in grave danger.
especially you, my lord, if left in your weakened state.
for l believe that Lucian is alive and well.
here. Now. ln this very city...
...preparing to hit us during the Awakening ceremony.
even more disturbing...
...is that if l'm correct...
...it would mean that Kraven is in league with him.
what's so pressing?
take a look.
Selene!
I want to speak with Selene!
ls that Michael?
ls it Michael?
what the hell is going on?
what's happening to me?
I'm coming out.
lf you go to him, you'll never be welcome in this house again.
now that Viktor's awake, we'll see what he has to say about that.
get in.
look, l warned her. l warned her, but she didn't listen.
l should've told you sooner.
told me what?
her human, Michael...
...he's not a human at all.
he's a Lycan.
what?
what's this ruckus?
never come here again. They'll kill you.
Why? Who are you people?
leave us.
like it or not, you're in the middle of a war that's raged for 1 000 years.
a blood feud between Vampires and Lycans.
werewolves.
consider yourself lucky.
most humans die within an hour of being bitten by an immortal.
the viruses we transmit are deadly.
and if you bit me, l'd become a Vampire instead?
no, you'd die.
no one's ever survived a bite from both species.
by rights, l'd stop the car and kill you myself...
why are you helping me?
l'm not.
l track down and kill your kind.
my only interest is finding out why Lucian wants you so badly.
do you know why l've been awakened, servant?
no, my lord.
but l'll soon find out.
you mean when you find her.
Yes, my lord.
you must let her come to me.
we have much to discuss, Selene and l.
she has shown me a great many disturbing things.
things that will be dealt with soon enough.
this coven has grown weak, decadent.
perhaps l should have left someone else in charge of my affairs.
still...
...her memories...
...are chaotic.
there's no sense of time.
please, my lord, let me summon assistance.
you're in need of rest.
l've rested enough.
what you will do is summon Marcus.
but he still slumbers, my lord.
Amelia and the Council members are arriving tomorrow night...
...to awaken Marcus.
not you, my lord.
you've been awakened a full century ahead of schedule.
that bitch has betrayed me.
now he knows everything she's been obsessing about.
wait.
are you to be trusted?
of course.
meet me in my quarters in 20 minutes.
lt's time l filled you in on a few things.
l'm seeing these things, these hallucinations.
they're not hallucinations, they're memories.
you've been bitten. His memories have been passed to you.
this is one of the places we use for interrogations. lt should be safe.
we own it.
first there was synthetic plasma, now this.
once it's approved, it should be our newest cash crop.
lt's cloned blood.
what are these for?
Lycans are allergic to silver.
lf we don't get our bullets out quickly, they die during questioning.
what do you do with them after?
we put the bullets back in.
how are things progressing?
we're ready.
why do you hate them so much?
l've already told you, we're at war.
so you're just following orders?
why can't you just answer the question?
fine.
something was in the stable tearing our horses to pieces.
l couldn't have saved my mother.
or my sister.
their screams woke me.
my father died outside, trying to fend them off.
l stood at my door...
...about to run to my nieces' room when...
twin girls.
barely six years old.
butchered...
...like animals.
Jesus Christ.
the next thing l knew, l was in his arms.
the war had spilled into our house.
he'd been tracking the Lycans for days.
he drove them off and saved me.
who?
Viktor.
the oldest and strongest of us.
that night, he made me a Vampire.
he gave me the strength to avenge my family.
since then, l've never looked back.
l saw your pictures.
who is the woman? Your wife?
lt may be wise to keep a closer eye on our cousins.
l'll have Raze see to it immediately.
l'm afraid that l'm going to have to place my faith in you, my friend.
time is running short.
I tried to swerve, but he hit us anyway.
he sent us right into the oncoming lane.
when l came to...
...l realized that part of the engine was in the front seat.
and she was pinned there, 6 inches from me...
...in this horrible position.
l think she was in shock because she just...
...kept asking me over and over again if l was all right.
she was more worried about me.
you know, if l knew then what l know now, l could have saved her.
there's no doubt in my mind about that.
but instead she died right there...
...about two minutes before the ambulance arrived.
after that, l didn't see any reason to stick around.
l spent a summer here with my grandfather when l was a kid so...
after l got my degree, l just...
l took off.
l came over here to move on, to forget.
lt seemed like a good idea at the time.
and have you?
moved on?
have you?
l need you to keep what l'm about to tell you under the strictest confidence.
lt can wait.
who started the war?
they did.
or at least that's what we've been led to believe.
digging into the past is forbidden.
l should be heading back.
what about me?
Viktor will know what to do. l'll come back.
l won't stay alone.
you will if you want to live.
no. l want to go with you.
what are you doing?
when the full moon rises tomorrow...
...you will change, you will kill, and you will feed.
lt's unavoidable.
l can't leave you free to roam around. l'm sorry.
a single round won't kill you, but silver prevents transformation.
at least for a few hours.
lf l don't return in time, do yourself a favor.
use it.
yeah?
my lord. She's here.
how could you do this to me? Embarrass me like this?
the entire coven knows that l had plans for us.
there is no us!
you'll go before Viktor...
...and tell him exactly what l tell you to!
from here on out, you'll do as l say.
ls that in any way unclear?
come closer, my child.
outside.
come on, move it.
l've been lost without you, my lord.
constantly hounded by Kraven and his never-ending infatuation.
lt is the oldest story in the book.
he desires the one thing he cannot have.
now, tell me...
...why have you come to believe that Lucian still lives?
Yeah.
l've given you all the proof you need.
lncoherent thoughts and images, nothing more.
which is precisely why the Awakening is performed by an elder.
you do not possess the necessary skills.
but l did see Lucian. l shot him. You must believe me.
the chain has never been broken. Not once.
not in 1 4 centuries.
not since we elders first began to leapfrog through time.
one awake, two asleep. That's the way of it.
lt is Marcus' turn to reign, not mine.
there's been a complication.
but l had no choice.
the coven is in danger, and Michael is the key...
don't
Oh. Yes.
the Lycan.
please.
give me the chance to get proof you require.
fine.
I will leave it to Kraven to collect the proof...
...if there is any.
how could you trust him over me?
because he is not the one who has been tainted by an animal.
l love you...
...like a daughter, but you leave me with no choice.
these rules are in place for a good reason...
...and they are the only reason we have survived this long.
you will not be shown an ounce of leniency.
when Amelia arrives, the Council will convene and decide your fate.
you have broken the chain and the Covenant!
you must be judged!
you should've listened to me and stayed out of this.
now you'll be lucky if l can convince the Council to spare your life.
tell me.
did you have the nerve to cut the skin from his arm, or did Lucian do it?
mark my words.
soon, you'll be seeing things my way.
no one opens this door. Understood?
l can't afford to have my future queen run off with that Lycan again.
shit.
change of plans. Amelia will be picked up by Soren and his team.
that's our job.
not anymore.
why are you helping me?
l'm not. l'm helping me.
what's going on?
the perimeter sensor's been tripped.
we're locking down the mansion.
lt's Selene. She's escaped, to go to him, to Michael.
l want that Lycan's head on a plate.
we need to go.
get down!
go. Go.
jump.
are you fucking kidding me?
any luck?
false alarm.
the dogs would've been all over it if anything had gotten near that fence.
Amelia should have arrived by now.
Yes.
look, l want you to slip off the property and find out what's keeping her.
you've got it.
maybe we should pull over and dose him.
fuck him. He'll be all right. We're almost there.
Oh, shit. He's not gonna make it. Pull over. Pull over!
get the kit.
stick him. Stick him.
my lord.
Viktor wants to speak with you.
my lord.
l sent for Selene...
...not you.
she's defied your orders...
...and fled the mansion, my lord.
your incompetence is becoming most taxing.
lt's not my fault. She's become obsessed...
...thinks that l'm at the core of some ridiculous conspiracy.
and here's my proof.
now, l want you to tell them exactly what you told me.
all right, all right.
we've been searching for someone with a special trait.
a direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus...
...Hungarian, a warlord...
...who came to power in the early seasons of the fifth century.
just in time to watch a plague ravage his village.
he alone survived.
somehow, his body was able to change the disease...
...mold it to his benefit.
he became the first true immortal.
and years later, he fathered at least two children...
...who inherited this same trait.
the sons of the Corvinus clan.
one bitten by bat, one by wolf...
...one to walk the lonely road of mortality as a human.
lt's a ridiculous legend. Nothing!
that may be...
...but our species do have a common ancestor.
a mutation of the original virus...
...is directly linked to his bloodline.
there is a descendant of Corvinus lying there........
...not three feet from you.
Yes.
but he's already a Vampire. We needed a pure source...
...untainted. An exact duplicate of the original virus...
...which we learned...
...was hidden away in the genetic code of his human descendants...
...and passed along in its latent form...
...down through the ages...
...all the way to Michael Corvin.
for years, we tried to combine their bloodlines.
and for years we failed.
it was useless.
even at the cellular level, our species seemed destined to destroy each other.
that is, until we found Michael.
the Corvinus strain allows for a perfect union.
a triple-celled platelet...
...which holds unspeakable power.
there can be no such union.
and to speak of it is heresy.
we'll see.
once Lucian has injected himself with Michael's blood.
Lucian is dead.
according to whom?
l need you to do something for me.
l can assure you, my child...
...Kraven will pay with his life.
soon, this house will lie in ruins.
not before you.
no, No, No, wait. Wait.
you and you alone will know the truth of this.
lf Lucian was able to get his hands on the blood of a Pure-Born...
...a powerful elder like Amelia...
...or yourself...
...and inject it along with Michael's blood...
abomination.
Half-Vampire...
...half-Lycan, but stronger than both.
l need to speak with Kahn.
my lord...
...the Council members have been assassinated.
what of Amelia?
they bled her dry.
lt has already begun.
l'm sorry l doubted you.
fear not, my child, absolution will be yours...
...the moment you kill the descendant of Corvinus, this...
...Michael.
you've been given an enzyme to stop the change.
lt may take a little time for the grogginess to dissipate.
that's enough!
just go and see what's keeping Raze, will you?
l really must apologize.
he's in desperate need of a lesson in manners.
speaking of manners, where are mine? Forgive me.
l'm Lucian.
l need to go.
l need to get back.
there's no going back.
there's no going anywhere.
the Vampires will kill you on sight. Just for being what you are.
one of us.
you are one of us.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
bringing an end to this conflict.
your war, it has nothing to do with me.
my war?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No! No!
Sonja!
they forced you to watch her die.
Sonja.
that's what started the war.
l saw it happen as if l were there.
we were slaves once.
the daylight guardians of the Vampires.
l was born in servitude...
...yet l harbored them no ill will.
l even took a Vampire for my bride.
lt was forbidden our union.
Viktor feared a blending of the species.
feared it so much...
...he killed her.
his own daughter...
...burnt alive...
...for loving me.
this is his war...
...Viktor's...
...and he's spent the last 600 years...
...exterminating my species.
what are they gonna do to Selene?
we have company.
l thought we had a deal.
patience.
Kraven.
these are matters to be discussed in private.
please escort our guests downstairs.
the Council has been destroyed.
soon, you will have it all.
both great covens and an ironclad peace treaty with the Lycans.
who l trust will not be forgotten when the spoils are tabulated.
how do you expect me to assume control now that Viktor's awake?
there's no defeating him. He grows stronger as we speak.
and that is precisely why l need Michael.
lf Viktor were so easy to dispatch...
...you'd have done it yourself centuries ago.
exit shaft! Move it!
son of a bitch!
Oh, shit!
lt's Viktor.
Yes.
and if you had done your job, he'd still be in hibernation.
where the hell is Raze?
ls there another way out?
l guess it didn't occur to you that you'll have to bleed to pull off this coup.
don't even think about leaving.
silver nitrate. Bet you weren't expecting that.
come on! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!
Lucian.
Selene!
Selene!
not yet.
l have to get you out. Viktor's on his way.
and he won't be satisfied until every Lycan's dead.
they'll kill you too, just for helping me.
l know.
l know what started the war.
that's enough. You're coming with me!
l hope l live to see Viktor choke the life from you!
l bet you do.
but let me tell you a little something about your beloved dark father.
he's the one who killed your family.
not the Lycans.
never could follow his own rules.
said he couldn't abide the taste of livestock.
so every once in a while, he went out and gorged himself on human blood.
l kept his secrets...
...cleaned up the mess.
but it was he...
........who crept room to room...
...dispatching everyone close to your heart.
but when he got to you...
...he just couldn't bear the thought of draining you dry.
you, who reminded him so much of his precious Sonja...
...the daughter he condemned to death.
lies.
believe what you want.
now come on.
your place is by my side.
so be it.
bite him!
Half-Vampire...
...half-Lycan...
...but stronger than both.
what the hell are you doing?
you may have killed me...
...cousin.
but my will...
...is done regardless.
where is he?
Where's Kraven?
forgive me, my child.
lt wasn't the Lycans.
lt was you.
leave us.
how could you bear my trust...
...knowing that you'd killed my family?
Yes.
l have taken from you.
but l have given so much more.
ls it not a fair trade, the life l have granted you? The gift of immortality?
and the life of your daughter?
your own flesh and blood?
l loved my daughter!
but the abomination growing in her womb...
...was a betrayal of me and of the coven!
l did what was necessary to protect the species...
...as l am forced to do yet again.
No!
time to die.
though I cannot predict the future...
...the consequences of tonight will reverberate through the halls...
...of both great covens for many years to come.
two Vampire elders have been slain...
...one by my own hand.
soon, Marcus will take the throne.
and a tide of anger and retribution will spill out into the night.
differences will be set aside.
allegiances will be made.
and soon...
...I will become the hunted.
BUCKY: Mr. Fire versus Mr. Ice.
for everything people were making it out to be you'd think it was our first fight.
it wasn't.
and it wouldn't be our last.
man: And, in local news,...
violence between servicemen and zoot-suiters reached a new level tonight...
after the wives of two sailors were criminally attacked...
an order listing Los Angeles as a restricted area has not deterred the fighting,...
but the Los Angeles Police Department assures the public that it has the situation completely under control.
man: Hey, sawbuck on the private chasing that skinny one over there!
come on, private!
come on, private!
that spic's quick!
Hi! Jesus Christ!
double or nothing on that greaser!
you're on!
lee: Bleichert!
BUCKY: I already knew him by reputation, record down pat.
a regular attraction at the Hollywood Legion Stadium. Lee Blanchard.
bleichert!
43-4-2 as a heavyweight.
and he knew me, Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert.
light heavy, 36-0-0. Ranked tenth by Ring Magazine.
fighting no-name opponents in a no-man's-land division.
get out of here!
Hey, get back there.
in our first year at Central Division Station we never spoke.
to the Halls of Tripoli, shitbirds.
who's this?
officer Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos Santos.
BUCKY: You came all the way down here just to roust some Class B felon?
came down here, same as you, to keep from getting killed.
happened to see some jarheads beating on a good collar.
I'll take him in the morning. - This is nuts.
we'll never get him booked tonight.
woman: I'm English.
that's a nice left hook you got.
well, you know, old habits.
my girlfriend saw you fight a couple of times over at the Olympic.
said you were good.
said you were somebody.
big fish, small pond.
never made it up to the big boys' division like you.
my first 20 fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager.
lucky to survive.
there's a Jew-boy Deputy D. A. Over in Central Warrants, wets his pants for fighters, and he promised me the next spot he can wangle.
BUCKY: Warrants was local celebrity as a cop. Warrants was chasing real criminals not rousting winos and wienie waggers in front of some Midnight Mission.
officer: Hey, Bleichert. Bleichert. They want to see you upstairs. The D. A.'s office.
Jew-boy D. A. S with hard-ons for fighters. Transfers, promotions...
officer Bleichert.
back then, I told myself I didn't care.
gentlemen, Bucky Bleichert.
Bucky, this is Chief Ted Green. - Nice to meet you.
deputy District Attorney, Ellis Loew.
read that out loud, Dwight. That's running in the Sunday Times.
before the war, the City of Angels was graced with two local fighters, pugilists with styles as different as fire and ice.
lee Blanchard...
excuse me.
Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice never fought each other, but duty brought them to the Los Angeles Police Department.
blanchard cracked the Boulevard-Citizens Bank robbery case in 1939
and captured thrill-killer, Tomas Dos Santos.
bleichert served with distinction during the Zoot Suit Wars.
jump to the end. - Right, boss.
on Election Day, voters are going to be asked to vote on a bond proposal to upgrade the LAPD's equipment and provide for an 8% pay raise for all personnel.
keep in mind the examples of Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice.
vote "Yes" on Proposition B.
what do you think?
subtle.
prop B's a loser right now, but I think if we can drum up some publicity we can get it passed in next month's election.
Yes, sir. - LEE: Fire and Ice.
ten rounds, Academy Gym, three weeks from now, before the election, all gate to charity.
after that, we bring back the boxing team.
what do you say, Bucky?
you in?
Bucky.
BUCKY: Lee.
I'd like you to meet Kay Lake.
BUCKY: Hello.
hello.
lee: You beefing up?
you know.
I was just telling Kay here about our new hobby.
are you a fight fan, Miss Lake?
no, Lee used to drag me. I was taking art classes, so I'd sketch.
she made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn't want me doing the "Vegetable Shuffle.
I promise not to hurt you.
that won't make Loew very happy.
Oh, he's got money on me?
seems that way. You win, you get Warrants.
what's in it for you?
well, betting works both ways.
my girl's got a taste for nice things and I can't afford to let her down.
right, babe?
keep talking about me in third person. It sends me.
what do you think of all this, Miss Lake?
well, for civic reasons, I hope the LAPD is ridiculed for perpetrating this farce.
for personal reasons, I hope Lee wins.
and, for aesthetic reasons, I hope you both look good with your shirts off.
Papa?
[Speaking IN German]Guten Tag, Dwight.
english, Papa.
Hey, you haven't finished this plane yet.
can you finish that?
here, sit down.
if you could just come by and clean the place up, keep an eye on him for a week or so.
I know I still owe you.
guess what I hear is right.
you'll want to place this with Mickey Cohen's indie. He's got Blanchard, 2-1.
that confident, huh?
you done your homework?
Yeah. I've done my homework.
I'm not betting on me, Pete.
Blanchard's the hero here.
that's the way the story's supposed to go. I'm just the other guy.
well, at least he looks good with his shirt off.
Where's your sketchpad?
I was never any good. Ended up with a Master's in History.
education's an expensive habit.
lee paid for it.
he shouldn't have quit fighting.
I asked him to.
besides, police work gives him a sense of order.
do you have a girlfriend, Dwight?
I'm saving myself for Rita Hayworth.
BUCKY: So he quits fighting for you, puts you through school.
quite a guy. Quite a pair.
why aren't you married?
you know, shacking's against regs.
probably cost him a stripe. So where's the diamonds and the bassinets, huh?
well, you'd have to sleep together for that, Dwight.
BUCKY: The gym was packed to the rafters.
a wild crowd hungry to see what was in us.
I already knew what was in us.
ambition, pride, dissatisfaction at a life turned just the wrong way.
luck, Dwight.
referee: Keep it clean!
lee: Come on.
PETE: I feel it's my duty as a friend to tell you this, make it look good.
I lost a lot of things in life... Seven!
... but never a fight for money. Eight!
I was trading Warrants for a close-out on old bad debts.
the eight grand I was going to clear was enough to maintain the old man in a good, clean rest home for three years.
the late-round tank job, enough to convince myself I wasn't a complete coward.
box!
referee: You're out!
doctor: Give me a smile.
watching! Watching! Ok?
it's nice, isn't it, Papa?
what do you think?
lee: Hey! Canvasback!
Canvasback!
you going to hide in there another week?
ain't you bored yet? Nice chompers.
so, you want to work Warrants?
I lost. What about Loew's deal?
don't you read the papers? The bond passed yesterday.
you want the job?
Atta boy, Mr. Ice.
champ!
show them what's under the lip, boss.
right over here.
TIERNEY: Officer Bleichert, the men of Central Dicks, Homicide, Ad Vice, Bunco, et cetera.
I'm Captain John Tierney.
you and Lee are the white men of the hour, so I hope you enjoyed your ovation.
you won't get another one till you retire.
TIERNEY: Enough horse shit! Listen!
this is the felony summary report for the week ending November 14, 1946.
first, two liquor store stickups
Broadway and Seventh, and Hill Liquor in Chinatown.
that one comes with a pistol whipping, my personal favorite.
Russ Millard, Homicides.
Hi. How are you?
my wife and kids thank you for the raise, Officer.
officer Bleichert, I'm Bill Koenig. This is Fritz Vogel.
welcome aboard.
pleasure to meet you.
Lee, I heard something you ought to know.
I was over at County Parole, and Bobby DeWitt got an "A" number.
he'll be released to L. A. In late January.
Thanks, Russ.
who's Bobby DeWitt?
old beef.
pot roast tonight?
don't say anything about DeWitt. It'll upset Kay.
sure.
nice place.
fight stash.
KAY: Hello. Dwight. Glad you could make it.
how was your first day?
mostly backslaps and paperwork if I know those boys.
and look at that smile now.
well, this is nice, isn't it?
what?
you and Lee partners. It's nice. It couldn't have worked out better if you'd planned it, could it, Dwight?
well, I could've beat him.
except you didn't.
I don't know, sweetheart. Bucky was somebody back in the day.
and here we all are...
it's nice.
it's more than nice.
might even be worth those front teeth of yours, Dwight.
a toast to Proposition B.
to the Bleichert-Blanchard rematch, bigger than Louis-Schmeling.
to my supercops!
to us!
BUCKY: From November through the New Year, Lee and I captured 11 hard felons, 18 traffic warrantees and three parole and probation absconders.
after tours of duty, Lee and I would go to the house and find Kay.
sometimes she'd make dinner for us. Other times, the three of us would go out on the town.
always she'd be there never between us, always in the middle.
film: The Man Who Laughs, 1928
for New Year's, we headed downtown to a dinner club owned by Morrie Friedman, a friend of Mickey Cohen's who sometimes clued Lee in to L. A. Drug traffic.
all: Happy New Year!
it was the best time of my life.
MILLARD: Listen up! Gentlemen, thank you.
Raymond Junior Nash."Statutory rape, armed robbery, felony mayhem. "Texas State Prison. Alcatraz.
Mr. Nash pistol-whipped a little old lady at a stickup near Leimert Park, Tuesday morning.
she died last night.
anything common in the sex beefs?
Negro girls. Young ones.
all the complainants have been coloreds.
BUCKY: Junior Nash was an inbred Okie shit-kicker who came west and took all us locals for easy marks just because we prefer our cowboys to look like Gene Autry.
of course, I didn't care if he was a hard man or what he thought about anything.
he raped children and beat senior citizens to death.
he was a coward and I wanted to put him down.
I got a tip for the hophead who's going to be at Norton and Coliseum tonight.
Hey, partner, everything good to go?
Yeah.
Nash just got a fuck pad on Norton and Coliseum.
Scram! Get out of here! - Okay!
fine!
don't make me say it twice!
women: All right! We're going! MEN: Make some money, man.
Oh, my! Oh, help! Help me! Help, somebody! Please! Help!
stop! Stop the car! Please stop! Stop! Stop!
fitch: Listen. I'm broke.
woman: Baby, he's gonna cut us a real good deal on this. I have been knowing him for a long time.
you ain't got to worry about a thing, okay?
you ain't got to worry. I got this dirty cop.
Mmm-hmm. He's going to take care of me real soon. And I mean real soon.
dirty cop?
I haven't heard of a clean cop, Baxter.
I just want to go home. Why do you do this to me, huh? Why? Why this? Why? Why?
same reason why you do this to me. You know why I do this to you.
where is this guy? He's right there. We almost there. Come on.
come on, baby! Come on.
Oh, God, I got to follow you now?
come on.
listen, this is the last time.
Bucky, wake up.
Bucky, look out! Get down!
BUCKY: I was half-asleep, but Lee had his boxer's wits about him.
he felt the blow coming.
he saved my life.
get your motherfucking hands off me, man. I ain't done nothing!
Yeah, what do you call that shooting gallery back there?
fuck you, man!
Lee!
Lee!
well, that's about it. Thank you for your time, Detective, and for the good police work.
blanchard knew the white guy, I guess. Busted him once.
he snitched for Lee a couple of times.
Baxter Fitch. It's a busy neighborhood.
take a look at top billing.
all right, easy. Guys, guys. Please.
don't trample over everything, please.
easy. Secure the area.
all right, listen up. No reporters view the body.
you photo men, finish taking your pictures now.
coroner's men, put a sheet on the body as soon as they are done.
we set up a perimeter six feet back.
any reporter crosses it, arrest him.
now, gentlemen, before this gets out of hand, let's put the kibosh on something.
with publicity, you get confessions.
with confessions, you get crazies, liars and false leads.
so, we keep some things quiet. The ear-to-ear facial lacerations, disembowelment, you keep this information to yourselves. Not your wives, not your girlfriends, no other officers, and I mean no...
Bleichert, what the hell are you doing here? Where the hell's Blanchard?
he's right here.
Nash might be renting a room in that building over there.
I heard something on the radio about a shooting. Was that Nash?
no.
we had some trouble.
stand back! Get back of the line! Move back. Come on, boys. Get them back!
Hey, Raymond Nash, remember?
we need to go check out that room.
Nash didn't do this.
no.
but he beat a woman to death. That's why he's our priority warrantee.
MILLARD: All right! I need everybody right now!
KAY: Baby. What happened? - Nothing. I don't want to talk about it.
Lee, Baxter Fitch just happened to be there? What happened, Lee?
what do you know about it? - I know you, Lee.
I know you, Lee.
Lee...
he knew one of the guys, so...
Dwight, was it you or them?
he saved my life.
Hey, Kay, who's Bobby DeWitt?
I know he's an old beef of Lee's.
but he doesn't want to talk about it and he gets out in a week.
you know who he is?
I'm scared, Dwight.
I'll take care of it.
you don't know Bobby.
BUCKY: Bobby DeWitt.
who are these men who feed on others?
what do they feel when they cut their names into somebody else's life?
it was the case that made Lee's career.
he'd never said a word about it and I'd never asked.
one of Lee's snitches fingered Bobby DeWitt, a small-time pimp with a yard-Iong rap, as the brains behind the job.
Dewitt never spoke the entire trial, never coughing up the dough even after damning character testimony from some of his girls including one Katherine Lake, formerly of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and looking to go straight.
Dewitt got 10 to life in San Quentin.
lee got Kay or maybe it was the other way around.
we're supposed to be looking for Nash.
priority.
Yeah, priority for Homicide Division, not us.
nice white girl gets snuffed.
got to show the voters they did the right thing passing the bond issue. It's A-plus, Buck. We don't miss this.
maybe she wasn't such a nice girl.
maybe that old lady that Nash snuffed was somebody's loving granny.
maybe we let the Bureau handle this and we get back to our job before Nash snuffs somebody else.
got any other maybes?
Yeah, maybe we've had enough headlines.
with or without you, Buck.
with or without you.
therefore, we have created a special unit which will include a number of highly trained officers including Detective Russell Millard, our very own Mr. Fire and his partner, Mr. Ice.
female REPORTER: Mr. Loew, can you assure the public that you will find the murderer before he strikes again?
I can guarantee you.
Mr. Loew...
this killer will be caught.
you got us detached?
slow and easy, Buck. I gave Loew a memo saying Nash blew our jurisdiction.
you did what? Are you fucking nuts?
it's all right. The APB still stands. He's covered.
this is the main event. Nash is pure undercard. Just give me another week with this girl.
what's your problem with this?
letting Nash slip.
CORONER: On gross pathology, we have a female Caucasian between 16 and 30.
the cadaver is presented in two halves with bisection level with the umbilicus.
through and through lacerations of both mouth corners.
no visible bruising on the neck.
rectangular abrasions on the wing tips of the sphenoid bones.
and, oh! A puncture wound, here, in the palm.
on the palm of the right hand.
there. Investigation of upper half abdominal cavity reveals no free-flowing blood.
intestines, stomach, spleen, liver, all removed.
is it all right to smoke, Doctor?
she won't mind.
lower half of cadaver reveals removal of all reproductive organs.
both legs broken at the knee.
questions?
what's your best guess?
well, here's what she wasn't, she wasn't raped and she wasn't pregnant.
in terms of the nitty-gritty, the cause of death is either the mouth wound here or she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat.
what about her insides?
they came out posthumously.
I say then he drained the blood from the body and washed it clean, probably in a bathtub.
have you got a name yet?
Elizabeth Ann Short. Date of birth, July 29, 1924, Medford, Massachusetts.
cops popped her in '43. Santa Barbara.
underage drinking.
other than that, she's clean.
four sisters, parents divorced, her father's here in L. A.
Oh, and I hear he sold some old photos of her to the Herald.
I got an alibi just in case you think I did it.
tighter than a crab's ass, and that is airtight.
detective Bleichert, Mr. Short. This is Detective Blanchard.
we would like to express our condolences for the loss of your daughter.
Yeah, I know who you are.
neither of you'd have lasted a round against Jim Jeffries.
and as for Betty, she called the tune, she paid the piper.
you want to hear my alibi?
Yeah, since you're so anxious to tell it.
Johnny on the spot here at the diner.
twenty-seven straight hours at that grill.
twenty-seven straight, last 17 overtime.
you ask anybody here.
they'll alibi me up tighter than a popcorn fart and that's pretty fucking tight.
when was the last time you saw your daughter, Mr. Short?
Betty came west in '43, stars in her eyes.
I promised her three squares and a five-spot, she kept the house tidy.
she live with you then?
I gave her the boot in July.
moved to Santa Barbara. Sent me a postcard a couple weeks later.
"some soldier beat her up pretty bad." That's the last I heard from her.
waitress: I need three pigs in a blanket.
keep your fucking panties on.
was that soldier her boyfriend, Mr. Short?
boyfriend?
they were all her boyfriends.
as long as they wore a uniform.
see, Betty believed in quantity before quality.
lee: You calling your own daughter a tramp?
I got five daughters.
one rotten apple ain't so bad.
well, maybe this time she had a boyfriend.
maybe.
any names, Mr. Short?
look, Tom, Dick, Harry, it don't matter.
she said she was looking for movie work, but...
she just paraded Hollywood Boulevard in those black get-ups of hers.
we just got handed the entire U. S. Armed forces as suspects.
flip to see who writes it up?
I'm staking Nash's pad tonight.
see if we get any strange drive-bys at the murder scene.
do me a favor. Stop by and check on Kay, will you?
Yeah, sure.
Hello, Dwight.
how'd you know it was me?
lee stomps.
is Lee working late? - Mmm.
what's wrong?
he's all bent out of shape on this dead girl.
he's going a little squirrelly.
Benzedrine, I think.
did you read the papers?
she's being played up as the hottest number since the atom bomb.
Ellis Loew's looking to make a career on it. I think Lee's not far behind.
what about you?
what about me?
what's going to happen to us, Dwight?
the three of us, I don't know. - No, us.
just the two of us.
us.
Kay, there is no two of us.
he's my partner.
and that's everything.
he's done a lot for me.
he's done even more for me.
there's food in the fridge.
good night.
thank our friend Bevo Means at the Examiner.
see, Bevo's painting Betty in a black dress like some actress in that Alan Ladd movie, Blue Dahlia.
should triple our confessions.
great.
Hollywood will fuck you when no one else will.
Hey, Johnson, go get a smoke.
what do you want to do? - I want to go back to Warrants.
no dice. You're a bright penny, Bleichert, and I need you here.
these are Betty's last known residences and associates.
you go to University Station, pick up Bill Koenig. Fritzie's sick. - Lieutenant...
no. You call me Russ, and you get out of here.
BUCKY: So, how do you want to play this, Sarge?
Fritzie usually does the talking.
muscle job?
why don't you let me try and talk to her?
all right, first question, does a Lorna Mertz live here?
she used to.
she skipped town this morning.
but I'm holding this suitcase till she ponies up the back rent.
is this it?
miss Short moved around quite a bit, too, didn't she?
was anybody threatening her?
poor Betty.
her problem wasn't too many enemies. It was too many friends.
I gathered that.
okay, let's change the subject.
all right. How about the world of high finance?
how about the movies?
you girls are all trying to break in, right?
darling, I'm in.
Congratulations. How about Betty?
maybe once. Maybe not at all.
she came around last Christmas, bragging about getting her big break.
guess after all those screen tests, she finally got a part.
but, she had a tendency to...
stretch the truth?
no. She fucking lied.
do you know the names of any of her boyfriends?
what is it? You can tell me.
well, I do remember, before she split, her and Lorna...
Mertz?
Yeah. Her and Lorna Mertz.
I mean I don't want to tell any tales out of school, but I do remember them being up on Hollywood Boulevard speaking to this older woman.
and she, she was wearing a man's suit and had a man's short haircut.
but it was just that once.
miss Saddon, are you saying they were talking to a lesbian?
your driver's here.
Yeah. I got to go.
we're not done yet.
well, then, how about you arrest me?
because the truck don't wait!
why don't we take a look inside Lorna's bag, and then maybe you can go.
SADDON: That's her.
Christ, she's 15.
do you know what studios Betty tested at?
they weren't exactly studios.
man 1: Screen test, Elizabeth Short.
man 2: So, where are you from?
Boston.
how long you've lived here?
two years.
lost your accent. - Yeah.
you know, when in Rome. Why? Are you looking for a girl with an accent?
no, no. That's all right.
because I can just bring it back like that. Because I'm a whiz with accents and I basically do every accent in the world.
we don't really need an accent, thank you.
cause I can be from anywhere.
okay. Let's hear that Boston accent.
now?
Yes. - No, I can't do it now.
I would have to meet with my dialect coach, Milton Perl, who was introduced to me by David Selznick.
you know David O. Selznick?
I do.
he's been very, very, very kind to me.
he's taken me out to such beautiful dinners in fancy restaurants.
and he's treated me like a lady and with respect and guess what.
he was very, very, very impressed when I did my Scarlett for him.
man 2: You auditioned for Scarlett O'Hara?
no, I didn't audition for Gone With The Wind, but, the thing is...
gosh, I just love that movie so much that I decided that
I had to memorize all of Scarlett's dialog.
OK. Well, what ...
and I want to do it for you - because I think you're handsome. - No, no, I don't think we need that...
but I think you're handsome and I'm going to do it for you right now.
as God is my witness.
as God is my witness.
I will never go hungry again.
even if I have to lie, or cheat
or steal.
I'll never go hungry again.
lee: He hated her. Bad, and he wanted the whole world to know it.
Lee, you got to eat something.
get this off the table! God damn it!
Dwight, you got to do something. He's been like this since last night.
get some air. I'll take care of him.
Bucky, this ain't a random job.
he knew what he was doing every single step of the way.
you learn anything about our girl today?
nothing worth you doing this to yourself.
come on. Let's get out of here. - No, I'm staying here with her.
come on.
go learn something about our girl!
beverage Control?
LAPD Homicide.
who got snuffed?
seen either of them?
the Dahlia's a sister?
I don't know. You tell me.
never seen her except in the papers. And the schoolgirl twist,
I've never seen.
we don't truck with underage stuff, capisci?
never seen her, man.
don't fucking lie to me.
she's 15 fucking years old.
come clean or I'll slap a contributing beef on you and you'll spend the next five years serving raisinjack to bull dykes in Tehachapi.
a couple of times.
two or three months ago.
she used to get drinks off the sisters, though, she liked boys.
I'm sure, man.
not the Dahlia. Never.
excuse me, ladies. I'm sorry.
I was wondering if you've seen this girl.
have you? - No.
haven't seen her.
this girl?
BUCKY: Mr. Fire versus Mr. Ice.
for everything people were making it out to be you'd think it was our first fight.
it wasn't.
and it wouldn't be our last.
man: And, in local news,...
violence between servicemen and zoot-suiters reached a new level tonight...
after the wives of two sailors were criminally attacked...
an order listing Los Angeles as a restricted area has not deterred the fighting,...
but the Los Angeles Police Department assures the public that it has the situation completely under control.
man: Hey, sawbuck on the private chasing that skinny one over there!
come on, private!
come on, private!
that spic's quick!
Hi! Jesus Christ!
double or nothing on that greaser!
you're on!
lee: Bleichert!
BUCKY: I already knew him by reputation, record down pat.
a regular attraction at the Hollywood Legion Stadium. Lee Blanchard.
bleichert!
43-4-2 as a heavyweight.
and he knew me, Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert.
light heavy, 36-0-0. Ranked tenth by Ring Magazine.
fighting no-name opponents in a no-man's-land division.
get out of here!
Hey, get back there.
in our first year at Central Division Station we never spoke.
to the Halls of Tripoli, shitbirds.
who's this?
officer Bleichert, meet Senor Tomas Dos Santos.
BUCKY: You came all the way down here just to roust some Class B felon?
came down here, same as you, to keep from getting killed.
happened to see some jarheads beating on a good collar.
I'll take him in the morning. - This is nuts.
we'll never get him booked tonight.
woman: I'm English.
that's a nice left hook you got.
well, you know, old habits.
my girlfriend saw you fight a couple of times over at the Olympic.
said you were good.
said you were somebody.
big fish, small pond.
never made it up to the big boys' division like you.
my first 20 fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager.
lucky to survive.
there's a Jew-boy Deputy D. A. Over in Central Warrants, wets his pants for fighters, and he promised me the next spot he can wangle.
BUCKY: Warrants was local celebrity as a cop. Warrants was chasing real criminals not rousting winos and wienie waggers in front of some Midnight Mission.
officer: Hey, Bleichert. Bleichert. They want to see you upstairs. The D. A.'s office.
Jew-boy D. A. S with hard-ons for fighters. Transfers, promotions...
officer Bleichert.
back then, I told myself I didn't care.
gentlemen, Bucky Bleichert.
Bucky, this is Chief Ted Green. - Nice to meet you.
deputy District Attorney, Ellis Loew.
read that out loud, Dwight. That's running in the Sunday Times.
before the war, the City of Angels was graced with two local fighters, pugilists with styles as different as fire and ice.
lee Blanchard...
excuse me.
Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice never fought each other, but duty brought them to the Los Angeles Police Department.
blanchard cracked the Boulevard-Citizens Bank robbery case in 1939
and captured thrill-killer, Tomas Dos Santos.
bleichert served with distinction during the Zoot Suit Wars.
jump to the end. - Right, boss.
on Election Day, voters are going to be asked to vote on a bond proposal to upgrade the LAPD's equipment and provide for an 8% pay raise for all personnel.
keep in mind the examples of Mr. Fire and Mr. Ice.
vote "Yes" on Proposition B.
what do you think?
subtle.
prop B's a loser right now, but I think if we can drum up some publicity we can get it passed in next month's election.
Yes, sir. - LEE: Fire and Ice.
ten rounds, Academy Gym, three weeks from now, before the election, all gate to charity.
after that, we bring back the boxing team.
what do you say, Bucky?
you in?
Bucky.
BUCKY: Lee.
I'd like you to meet Kay Lake.
BUCKY: Hello.
hello.
lee: You beefing up?
you know.
I was just telling Kay here about our new hobby.
are you a fight fan, Miss Lake?
no, Lee used to drag me. I was taking art classes, so I'd sketch.
she made me quit fighting the smokers. Didn't want me doing the "Vegetable Shuffle.
I promise not to hurt you.
that won't make Loew very happy.
Oh, he's got money on me?
seems that way. You win, you get Warrants.
what's in it for you?
well, betting works both ways.
my girl's got a taste for nice things and I can't afford to let her down.
right, babe?
keep talking about me in third person. It sends me.
what do you think of all this, Miss Lake?
well, for civic reasons, I hope the LAPD is ridiculed for perpetrating this farce.
for personal reasons, I hope Lee wins.
and, for aesthetic reasons, I hope you both look good with your shirts off.
Papa?
[Speaking IN German]Guten Tag, Dwight.
english, Papa.
Hey, you haven't finished this plane yet.
can you finish that?
here, sit down.
if you could just come by and clean the place up, keep an eye on him for a week or so.
I know I still owe you.
guess what I hear is right.
you'll want to place this with Mickey Cohen's indie. He's got Blanchard, 2-1.
that confident, huh?
you done your homework?
Yeah. I've done my homework.
I'm not betting on me, Pete.
Blanchard's the hero here.
that's the way the story's supposed to go. I'm just the other guy.
well, at least he looks good with his shirt off.
Where's your sketchpad?
I was never any good. Ended up with a Master's in History.
education's an expensive habit.
lee paid for it.
he shouldn't have quit fighting.
I asked him to.
besides, police work gives him a sense of order.
do you have a girlfriend, Dwight?
I'm saving myself for Rita Hayworth.
BUCKY: So he quits fighting for you, puts you through school.
quite a guy. Quite a pair.
why aren't you married?
you know, shacking's against regs.
probably cost him a stripe. So where's the diamonds and the bassinets, huh?
well, you'd have to sleep together for that, Dwight.
BUCKY: The gym was packed to the rafters.
a wild crowd hungry to see what was in us.
I already knew what was in us.
ambition, pride, dissatisfaction at a life turned just the wrong way.
luck, Dwight.
referee: Keep it clean!
lee: Come on.
PETE: I feel it's my duty as a friend to tell you this, make it look good.
I lost a lot of things in life... Seven!
... but never a fight for money. Eight!
I was trading Warrants for a close-out on old bad debts.
the eight grand I was going to clear was enough to maintain the old man in a good, clean rest home for three years.
the late-round tank job, enough to convince myself I wasn't a complete coward.
box!
referee: You're out!
doctor: Give me a smile.
watching! Watching! Ok?
it's nice, isn't it, Papa?
what do you think?
lee: Hey! Canvasback!
Canvasback!
you going to hide in there another week?
ain't you bored yet? Nice chompers.
so, you want to work Warrants?
I lost. What about Loew's deal?
don't you read the papers? The bond passed yesterday.
you want the job?
Atta boy, Mr. Ice.
champ!
show them what's under the lip, boss.
right over here.
TIERNEY: Officer Bleichert, the men of Central Dicks, Homicide, Ad Vice, Bunco, et cetera.
I'm Captain John Tierney.
you and Lee are the white men of the hour, so I hope you enjoyed your ovation.
you won't get another one till you retire.
TIERNEY: Enough horse shit! Listen!
this is the felony summary report for the week ending November 14, 1946.
first, two liquor store stickups
Broadway and Seventh, and Hill Liquor in Chinatown.
that one comes with a pistol whipping, my personal favorite.
Russ Millard, Homicides.
Hi. How are you?
my wife and kids thank you for the raise, Officer.
officer Bleichert, I'm Bill Koenig. This is Fritz Vogel.
welcome aboard.
pleasure to meet you.
Lee, I heard something you ought to know.
I was over at County Parole, and Bobby DeWitt got an "A" number.
he'll be released to L. A. In late January.
Thanks, Russ.
who's Bobby DeWitt?
old beef.
pot roast tonight?
don't say anything about DeWitt. It'll upset Kay.
sure.
nice place.
fight stash.
KAY: Hello. Dwight. Glad you could make it.
how was your first day?
mostly backslaps and paperwork if I know those boys.
and look at that smile now.
well, this is nice, isn't it?
what?
you and Lee partners. It's nice. It couldn't have worked out better if you'd planned it, could it, Dwight?
well, I could've beat him.
except you didn't.
I don't know, sweetheart. Bucky was somebody back in the day.
and here we all are...
it's nice.
it's more than nice.
might even be worth those front teeth of yours, Dwight.
a toast to Proposition B.
to the Bleichert-Blanchard rematch, bigger than Louis-Schmeling.
to my supercops!
to us!
BUCKY: From November through the New Year, Lee and I captured 11 hard felons, 18 traffic warrantees and three parole and probation absconders.
after tours of duty, Lee and I would go to the house and find Kay.
sometimes she'd make dinner for us. Other times, the three of us would go out on the town.
always she'd be there never between us, always in the middle.
film: The Man Who Laughs, 1928
for New Year's, we headed downtown to a dinner club owned by Morrie Friedman, a friend of Mickey Cohen's who sometimes clued Lee in to L. A. Drug traffic.
all: Happy New Year!
it was the best time of my life.
MILLARD: Listen up! Gentlemen, thank you.
Raymond Junior Nash."Statutory rape, armed robbery, felony mayhem. "Texas State Prison. Alcatraz.
Mr. Nash pistol-whipped a little old lady at a stickup near Leimert Park, Tuesday morning.
she died last night.
anything common in the sex beefs?
Negro girls. Young ones.
all the complainants have been coloreds.
BUCKY: Junior Nash was an inbred Okie shit-kicker who came west and took all us locals for easy marks just because we prefer our cowboys to look like Gene Autry.
of course, I didn't care if he was a hard man or what he thought about anything.
he raped children and beat senior citizens to death.
he was a coward and I wanted to put him down.
I got a tip for the hophead who's going to be at Norton and Coliseum tonight.
Hey, partner, everything good to go?
Yeah.
Nash just got a fuck pad on Norton and Coliseum.
Scram! Get out of here! - Okay!
fine!
don't make me say it twice!
women: All right! We're going! MEN: Make some money, man.
Oh, my! Oh, help! Help me! Help, somebody! Please! Help!
stop! Stop the car! Please stop! Stop! Stop!
fitch: Listen. I'm broke.
woman: Baby, he's gonna cut us a real good deal on this. I have been knowing him for a long time.
you ain't got to worry about a thing, okay?
you ain't got to worry. I got this dirty cop.
Mmm-hmm. He's going to take care of me real soon. And I mean real soon.
dirty cop?
I haven't heard of a clean cop, Baxter.
I just want to go home. Why do you do this to me, huh? Why? Why this? Why? Why?
same reason why you do this to me. You know why I do this to you.
where is this guy? He's right there. We almost there. Come on.
come on, baby! Come on.
Oh, God, I got to follow you now?
come on.
listen, this is the last time.
Bucky, wake up.
Bucky, look out! Get down!
BUCKY: I was half-asleep, but Lee had his boxer's wits about him.
he felt the blow coming.
he saved my life.
get your motherfucking hands off me, man. I ain't done nothing!
Yeah, what do you call that shooting gallery back there?
fuck you, man!
Lee!
Lee!
well, that's about it. Thank you for your time, Detective, and for the good police work.
blanchard knew the white guy, I guess. Busted him once.
he snitched for Lee a couple of times.
Baxter Fitch. It's a busy neighborhood.
take a look at top billing.
all right, easy. Guys, guys. Please.
don't trample over everything, please.
easy. Secure the area.
all right, listen up. No reporters view the body.
you photo men, finish taking your pictures now.
coroner's men, put a sheet on the body as soon as they are done.
we set up a perimeter six feet back.
any reporter crosses it, arrest him.
now, gentlemen, before this gets out of hand, let's put the kibosh on something.
with publicity, you get confessions.
with confessions, you get crazies, liars and false leads.
so, we keep some things quiet. The ear-to-ear facial lacerations, disembowelment, you keep this information to yourselves. Not your wives, not your girlfriends, no other officers, and I mean no...
Bleichert, what the hell are you doing here? Where the hell's Blanchard?
he's right here.
Nash might be renting a room in that building over there.
I heard something on the radio about a shooting. Was that Nash?
no.
we had some trouble.
stand back! Get back of the line! Move back. Come on, boys. Get them back!
Hey, Raymond Nash, remember?
we need to go check out that room.
Nash didn't do this.
no.
but he beat a woman to death. That's why he's our priority warrantee.
MILLARD: All right! I need everybody right now!
KAY: Baby. What happened? - Nothing. I don't want to talk about it.
Lee, Baxter Fitch just happened to be there? What happened, Lee?
what do you know about it? - I know you, Lee.
I know you, Lee.
Lee...
he knew one of the guys, so...
Dwight, was it you or them?
he saved my life.
Hey, Kay, who's Bobby DeWitt?
I know he's an old beef of Lee's.
but he doesn't want to talk about it and he gets out in a week.
you know who he is?
I'm scared, Dwight.
I'll take care of it.
you don't know Bobby.
BUCKY: Bobby DeWitt.
who are these men who feed on others?
what do they feel when they cut their names into somebody else's life?
it was the case that made Lee's career.
he'd never said a word about it and I'd never asked.
one of Lee's snitches fingered Bobby DeWitt, a small-time pimp with a yard-Iong rap, as the brains behind the job.
Dewitt never spoke the entire trial, never coughing up the dough even after damning character testimony from some of his girls including one Katherine Lake, formerly of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and looking to go straight.
Dewitt got 10 to life in San Quentin.
lee got Kay or maybe it was the other way around.
we're supposed to be looking for Nash.
priority.
Yeah, priority for Homicide Division, not us.
nice white girl gets snuffed.
got to show the voters they did the right thing passing the bond issue. It's A-plus, Buck. We don't miss this.
maybe she wasn't such a nice girl.
maybe that old lady that Nash snuffed was somebody's loving granny.
maybe we let the Bureau handle this and we get back to our job before Nash snuffs somebody else.
got any other maybes?
Yeah, maybe we've had enough headlines.
with or without you, Buck.
with or without you.
therefore, we have created a special unit which will include a number of highly trained officers including Detective Russell Millard, our very own Mr. Fire and his partner, Mr. Ice.
female REPORTER: Mr. Loew, can you assure the public that you will find the murderer before he strikes again?
I can guarantee you.
Mr. Loew...
this killer will be caught.
you got us detached?
slow and easy, Buck. I gave Loew a memo saying Nash blew our jurisdiction.
you did what? Are you fucking nuts?
it's all right. The APB still stands. He's covered.
this is the main event. Nash is pure undercard. Just give me another week with this girl.
what's your problem with this?
letting Nash slip.
CORONER: On gross pathology, we have a female Caucasian between 16 and 30.
the cadaver is presented in two halves with bisection level with the umbilicus.
through and through lacerations of both mouth corners.
no visible bruising on the neck.
rectangular abrasions on the wing tips of the sphenoid bones.
and, oh! A puncture wound, here, in the palm.
on the palm of the right hand.
there. Investigation of upper half abdominal cavity reveals no free-flowing blood.
intestines, stomach, spleen, liver, all removed.
is it all right to smoke, Doctor?
she won't mind.
lower half of cadaver reveals removal of all reproductive organs.
both legs broken at the knee.
questions?
what's your best guess?
well, here's what she wasn't, she wasn't raped and she wasn't pregnant.
in terms of the nitty-gritty, the cause of death is either the mouth wound here or she was beaten to death with something like a baseball bat.
what about her insides?
they came out posthumously.
I say then he drained the blood from the body and washed it clean, probably in a bathtub.
have you got a name yet?
Elizabeth Ann Short. Date of birth, July 29, 1924, Medford, Massachusetts.
cops popped her in '43. Santa Barbara.
underage drinking.
other than that, she's clean.
four sisters, parents divorced, her father's here in L. A.
Oh, and I hear he sold some old photos of her to the Herald.
I got an alibi just in case you think I did it.
tighter than a crab's ass, and that is airtight.
detective Bleichert, Mr. Short. This is Detective Blanchard.
we would like to express our condolences for the loss of your daughter.
Yeah, I know who you are.
neither of you'd have lasted a round against Jim Jeffries.
and as for Betty, she called the tune, she paid the piper.
you want to hear my alibi?
Yeah, since you're so anxious to tell it.
Johnny on the spot here at the diner.
twenty-seven straight hours at that grill.
twenty-seven straight, last 17 overtime.
you ask anybody here.
they'll alibi me up tighter than a popcorn fart and that's pretty fucking tight.
when was the last time you saw your daughter, Mr. Short?
Betty came west in '43, stars in her eyes.
I promised her three squares and a five-spot, she kept the house tidy.
she live with you then?
I gave her the boot in July.
moved to Santa Barbara. Sent me a postcard a couple weeks later.
"some soldier beat her up pretty bad." That's the last I heard from her.
waitress: I need three pigs in a blanket.
keep your fucking panties on.
was that soldier her boyfriend, Mr. Short?
boyfriend?
they were all her boyfriends.
as long as they wore a uniform.
see, Betty believed in quantity before quality.
lee: You calling your own daughter a tramp?
I got five daughters.
one rotten apple ain't so bad.
well, maybe this time she had a boyfriend.
maybe.
any names, Mr. Short?
look, Tom, Dick, Harry, it don't matter.
she said she was looking for movie work, but...
she just paraded Hollywood Boulevard in those black get-ups of hers.
we just got handed the entire U. S. Armed forces as suspects.
flip to see who writes it up?
I'm staking Nash's pad tonight.
see if we get any strange drive-bys at the murder scene.
do me a favor. Stop by and check on Kay, will you?
Yeah, sure.
Hello, Dwight.
how'd you know it was me?
lee stomps.
is Lee working late? - Mmm.
what's wrong?
he's all bent out of shape on this dead girl.
he's going a little squirrelly.
Benzedrine, I think.
did you read the papers?
she's being played up as the hottest number since the atom bomb.
Ellis Loew's looking to make a career on it. I think Lee's not far behind.
what about you?
what about me?
what's going to happen to us, Dwight?
the three of us, I don't know. - No, us.
just the two of us.
us.
Kay, there is no two of us.
he's my partner.
and that's everything.
he's done a lot for me.
he's done even more for me.
there's food in the fridge.
good night.
thank our friend Bevo Means at the Examiner.
see, Bevo's painting Betty in a black dress like some actress in that Alan Ladd movie, Blue Dahlia.
should triple our confessions.
great.
Hollywood will fuck you when no one else will.
Hey, Johnson, go get a smoke.
what do you want to do? - I want to go back to Warrants.
no dice. You're a bright penny, Bleichert, and I need you here.
these are Betty's last known residences and associates.
you go to University Station, pick up Bill Koenig. Fritzie's sick. - Lieutenant...
no. You call me Russ, and you get out of here.
BUCKY: So, how do you want to play this, Sarge?
Fritzie usually does the talking.
muscle job?
why don't you let me try and talk to her?
all right, first question, does a Lorna Mertz live here?
she used to.
she skipped town this morning.
but I'm holding this suitcase till she ponies up the back rent.
is this it?
miss Short moved around quite a bit, too, didn't she?
was anybody threatening her?
poor Betty.
her problem wasn't too many enemies. It was too many friends.
I gathered that.
okay, let's change the subject.
all right. How about the world of high finance?
how about the movies?
you girls are all trying to break in, right?
darling, I'm in.
Congratulations. How about Betty?
maybe once. Maybe not at all.
she came around last Christmas, bragging about getting her big break.
guess after all those screen tests, she finally got a part.
but, she had a tendency to...
stretch the truth?
no. She fucking lied.
do you know the names of any of her boyfriends?
what is it? You can tell me.
well, I do remember, before she split, her and Lorna...
Mertz?
Yeah. Her and Lorna Mertz.
I mean I don't want to tell any tales out of school, but I do remember them being up on Hollywood Boulevard speaking to this older woman.
and she, she was wearing a man's suit and had a man's short haircut.
but it was just that once.
miss Saddon, are you saying they were talking to a lesbian?
your driver's here.
Yeah. I got to go.
we're not done yet.
well, then, how about you arrest me?
because the truck don't wait!
why don't we take a look inside Lorna's bag, and then maybe you can go.
SADDON: That's her.
Christ, she's 15.
do you know what studios Betty tested at?
they weren't exactly studios.
man 1: Screen test, Elizabeth Short.
man 2: So, where are you from?
Boston.
how long you've lived here?
two years.
lost your accent. - Yeah.
you know, when in Rome. Why? Are you looking for a girl with an accent?
no, no. That's all right.
because I can just bring it back like that. Because I'm a whiz with accents and I basically do every accent in the world.
we don't really need an accent, thank you.
cause I can be from anywhere.
okay. Let's hear that Boston accent.
now?
Yes. - No, I can't do it now.
I would have to meet with my dialect coach, Milton Perl, who was introduced to me by David Selznick.
you know David O. Selznick?
I do.
he's been very, very, very kind to me.
he's taken me out to such beautiful dinners in fancy restaurants.
and he's treated me like a lady and with respect and guess what.
he was very, very, very impressed when I did my Scarlett for him.
man 2: You auditioned for Scarlett O'Hara?
no, I didn't audition for Gone With The Wind, but, the thing is...
gosh, I just love that movie so much that I decided that
I had to memorize all of Scarlett's dialog.
OK. Well, what ...
and I want to do it for you - because I think you're handsome. - No, no, I don't think we need that...
but I think you're handsome and I'm going to do it for you right now.
as God is my witness.
as God is my witness.
I will never go hungry again.
even if I have to lie, or cheat
or steal.
I'll never go hungry again.
lee: He hated her. Bad, and he wanted the whole world to know it.
Lee, you got to eat something.
get this off the table! God damn it!
Dwight, you got to do something. He's been like this since last night.
get some air. I'll take care of him.
Bucky, this ain't a random job.
he knew what he was doing every single step of the way.
you learn anything about our girl today?
nothing worth you doing this to yourself.
come on. Let's get out of here. - No, I'm staying here with her.
come on.
go learn something about our girl!
beverage Control?
LAPD Homicide.
who got snuffed?
seen either of them?
the Dahlia's a sister?
I don't know. You tell me.
never seen her except in the papers. And the schoolgirl twist,
I've never seen.
we don't truck with underage stuff, capisci?
never seen her, man.
don't fucking lie to me.
she's 15 fucking years old.
come clean or I'll slap a contributing beef on you and you'll spend the next five years serving raisinjack to bull dykes in Tehachapi.
a couple of times.
two or three months ago.
she used to get drinks off the sisters, though, she liked boys.
I'm sure, man.
not the Dahlia. Never.
excuse me, ladies. I'm sorry.
I was wondering if you've seen this girl.
have you? - No.
haven't seen her.
this girl?
Hey, buddy. What's happening, babe? - What's up, Nick?
we've got a young fop here, man. - Yeah?
nice bike. Fast, huh?
Yeah. - Oh, yeah?
wanna bet?
ain't you got nothing better to do with your Sundays?
Yeah, I got 50 on Nick, man.
what do you say?
Yeah, sure. I'll take your Social Security.
take him, Nick.
you're a real fucking wacko, you know that, pal?
Nicky, it's me.
the school called again.
we're another month behind. That makes three.
I told them we'd send a check, okay?
Oh, I'm taking the kids to Mom's on Saturday.
you could have them the next Saturday.
listen, good luck today. Bye.
Hi. Nick Conklin? Barney Yudell, attorney.
do yourself a favor. Wear a jacket and tie today.
see you at 10: 00.
Hey. How are you, pal, huh? - Dad!
Hi, Dad. - Come here. Hi, buddy. Give me a kiss.
he got in trouble. He called Sister Elizabeth a name...
and she heard. - What did you call Elizabeth?
an ugly goose. - Ugly goose, huh?
I've heard you say worse things than that.
listen, honey, I want you to give this money to Mommy, okay?
okay. - I'm gonna see you in about two days.
have a good day at school. - Okay.
all right, pal, you hanging on tight? - Yeah.
you still want to go in the rain? Yeah? - Yeah.
all right.
Dale, Nicky. Okay?
right here. Right here.
what do you see, baby?
baby, I hope somebody's paying you to wear that goddamn suit.
almost. - Come on. Get on.
I don't want anybody seeing you walk around like that.
take me for a ride? - Let's go.
look out, Nicky.
got some new Bostonians. 85 bucks a pop, babe.
let's hope they threw in some socks with them.
ladies of the '80s are going for shoes.
yeah? Where did you hear that? - I read it in a magazine.
they say it's the second place they're looking.
listen, I was thinking.
I hear that when Internal Affairs comes to see you, it's not as bad as when you go to see them.
I don't know. I'll let you know when it's over.
here's the idea. - Yeah?
you dazzle the bastards. You go in uniform, you show them your breast bars.
I'm serious. A detective like you, you got commendations up the ying-yang.
they should be naming a wing in Attica after you.
go ahead.
Hey, Farentino, you ugly mug!
Hey, Vincent. Off and on. Let's go. Come on, huh?
grab your dick and count to infinity, babe.
fuck you.
where we meeting? Scalari's? Lunch on me.
we'll see how it goes, babe.
what do you mean, "We'll see how it goes"?
we'll see how it goes. - Conklin, if you don't show up, you're going to be in real trouble, Conklin, okay?
1300. Do or die. - You got it.
Hey, you watch your tail, cowboy. All right?
Yeah.
you guys ready? - Yeah, baby.
you'll walk, Nick, if you tell the truth and you keep your wits.
run your mouth and they'll screw you, man.
I got nothing to hide.
I hope not, for my sake.
Conklin. - Hey, Bobby. How you doing?
Hey, Nick. Hey, listen, good luck tonight.
Thanks, babe.
how's your lawyer? - Hardly know him.
let me tell you something, Nicky.
if these people get their way, you'll get to know him real well.
hell, you'll probably be sending his kids through college.
well, you're...
it's quite an impressive record.
a regular hero.
tell me about Monty Ronan.
good cop. He's... He's the kind of guy...
you want backing you up when the shit goes down.
that's what you think? - Yeah. Yeah, that's what I think.
he's dirt and you know it. - Oh, yeah?
well, you worked the streets with him, huh?
Hey, pal, we got 30 homicides a week, you know.
tell us about Patrick Donleavy.
all right, my client has no knowledge of any malfeasance on the part of that officer.
your client's in a good position to know.
28 June, 1988, your unit arrested three suspects.
cash was logged in at $65, 000 and change.
we have reason to believe there was over $73, 000...
in the vehicle you impounded.
says who? - There are sources.
well, now we're listening to the suspects instead of the cops, huh?
it depends on the cop.
I don't like heroes, Conklin. They think the rules don't apply.
Hey, look, I try to do my job, okay? It ain't easy out there.
and I'm clean.
well, Detective, you have, what? A couple of kids at St. John's, house payments, alimony, apartment.
that's a king-sized nut. I admire your thrift.
well, life's a bitch.
we did the math, hero.
you're at least 1, 000 a month in the hole.
you're into the shylocks. You're taking.
Hey, you want to charge me, okay, you charge me.
you want to jerk off, you go back to your office. - Knock it off.
we'll charge you. Someone will help us out.
nobody's got a softer center than a dirty cop.
you want dirt, huh? You go to City Hall, huh? Police Plaza.
I mean, the whole goddamn system's falling apart...
and you're busting my ass?
suits, man. - Come on.
you okay? - Yeah.
okay.
how's the girls in Japan?
what is the most important control exercised by the sergeant as a first-line supervisor?
a, cost control, B, manpower... - B, manpower control.
manpower control, my ass.
what are we going here for, sergeant or Supreme Court Justice?
if you want the braid, you gotta know the stuff. How'd it go?
how you doing, Joe? - Good, good.
give me a Scotch, will you? - Scotch?
that bad, huh?
they didn't know whether to shit or go blind.
Thanks, Joe.
Joe, I think you'd better melt a little cheese on that Scotch.
he's gonna be drinking his lunch.
to those gallant crime fighters, Internal Affairs Division.
fuck them. - Fuck them.
you ought to think about that, pal. - What's that? IAD?
ambitious guy like you, fast way to get to headquarters.
you never know, babe. - That's right. You never know.
you see Abolofia on the way in? - Yeah, I saw him.
he's importing Subarus now.
wise guys gotta eat, too, you know.
just my luck. I'm under investigation. I'm having lunch with the mob.
intelligence probably got this place wired.
yeah? Well, if you got a beef, all you got to do is talk into my left titty here.
Joe, what do you got for a special?
I got a special for you that's so hot, it's probably illegal.
look out!
what's going on?
don't even think about it.
it's done, babe.
what? What did you say? What?
sit down. Sit down.
relax. Relax.
it's all right. Let's eat. Mind our business over here.
just eat. Relax. Mind your business.
Joey, 911, babe. 911.
police! Everybody down!
police! Hold it there!
hold it!
get out of the way!
what's going on?
Hey!
watch it!
police! Get out of here!
get the fuck out of there! All of you!
police, guys.
guy came through here, where'd he go?
there.
all right, get out of here, all of you! Get out!
out! Out! Out!
go! Get out!
Nicky?
where are you, Nicky?
here, Charlie!
you see me? You okay?
you're getting up.
I got him. Up!
okay. Here we go. Nice and easy.
come on. Come on.
you little fuck. Come here!
come here, you little shit.
all right. I got him.
take him out of here. Get him out.
settle down, pal. - Get him out of here.
Yeah, yeah, just a second.
we got him. Come on.
you okay?
japanese mob.
well, our victims are certainly yakuza.
Yeah. The Bureau's sending down a guy to find out...
what the Jap mob and the mafia were doing sharing a bottle of Chianti.
so that means nobody knows nothing.
nobody knows dick.
what's that? The paper the box was in?
Yeah.
the famous box.
I'm gonna go down the stairs and give our little darling a talk.
I gotta make some calls.
Mr. Terauchi, thank you for coming. This is Mr. Izawa.
he's my interpreter during this interrogation.
our boy doesn't speak any English.
he ain't talking too much Japanese either.
who's this guy?
it's the Japanese embassy.
they want him first.
my collar, my case.
Hey, Captain,
I got two clean homicides in there, right?
I almost bought it.
now, if they want him, they can have him after 20 years to life.
what's this?
japanese embassy talks to the State Department,
state to Police Plaza, they to me and me to you.
shit rolls downhill. What can I tell you?
they want somebody to take him back. That's you and Vincent.
this is bullshit, man.
do you want them to keep hammering you, Nick, huh? - Bullshit, bullshit.
from what I hear, you already went off in their faces, which is exactly what they want.
take a breather, Nicky. Relax. Get a geisha. Do us both a favor.
here.
you give that to Internal Affairs.
as long as they're going to be in my apartment, they can water the fucking plants.
I'll stand behind you 100%, Nick, as long as you're right.
as long as you're right.
may I ask him a few questions?
fine, be my guest.
so what do you think it's costing the city to ship this asshole home, huh?
I don't know, but it ain't worth the cost of the dirt to bury him.
you know Ronan, right? - Ronan?
Yeah. - Yeah, I know Ronan.
good cop. - Yeah, he's a good cop.
he's a good cop.
he is a good cop. - All right.
busts his ass 14 hours a day, so he can end up in debt for the rest of his life.
I look at this asshole here.
man is wearing my house payments.
listen, just because Ronan was desperate and he got tempted...
doesn't make him less wrong, Nick.
that's bullshit, okay. You take something off the top of some dealer you locked up, you don't get crucified.
you wait till you get a family, pal.
start there with the private schools, the braces...
the man is just trying to get by.
what the fuck are you looking at?
madam, please fasten your seat belt.
excuse me, sir. Is your seat belt fastened?
what happened, Nick?
I don't know, man. I think he got a...
he bit his lip or something.
your seat belt tight, babe?
here we go, babe. We got the local heat.
you're looking for us.
detective Sergeant Conklin, New York.
welcome to Japan, gentlemen. - Thank you.
I am Inspector Nashida, Osaka Prefectural Police.
this is my partner, Detective Vincent.
Hey, do you got some paperwork for us?
Oh, yes.
would you sign here and here, please?
thank you.
this is all for you. - Thanks.
key, please. - He's got the key.
here you go.
thank you.
come on, Nicky.
off duty, Nicky. Off duty.
we're gonna be in and out of geishas like a Times Square pickpocket.
I wanna go to sleep.
remember, ladies, if you get bored, - Hotel Meiji, Hotel Meiji. - In your dreams.
detective Conklin,
I am Inspector Yamato, Osaka Prefectural Police.
son of a bitch!
they were dressed as officers.
it was in Japanese.
all right?
Yeah.
captain, look. They were wearing the uniforms, okay?
they got the paperwork. It's not like I'm giving them cab fare.
definite maybe. Definite maybes.
unseen. Definite no's.
Yeah, it ain't a hell of a lot of fun over here either, all right?
now, look, I went by the book, okay?
there's just no way to verify the ID. - Nicky.
maybe. I don't know. - Nine definite maybes.
chief, can I score some coffee? Coffee.
coffee?
coffee. - One?
no, two. - The paperwork's in Japanese.
what do you want me to do? A strip search?
I'm sitting here two hours, Captain.
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! How much more time?
no. We've got another no.
he does that one more time, I'm gonna cut it off.
nothing, Cap. - Nicky, look at this.
unbelievable. Identical strangers.
all right, all right, okay. But, listen, Captain, this is still an NYPD collar, right?
noodles? You're gonna hurt yourself.
let me just salvage the situation. I'll take care of it.
now, what the hell is that supposed to mean?
why don't you tell the fucking IAD suits to go kiss my ass.
enough of this bullshit.
we on?
Nicky? - What?
game time.
all right, we're on, we're on, Cap. I'll call you later.
action.
now, what did Ollie have to say? - You don't wanna know, Charlie.
this is bullshit having to wait this long.
you're gonna be nice?
Yeah. I'm gonna be nice. I'm gonna be nice, all right?
I just hope they've got a Nip in this building...
that speaks fucking English.
assistant Inspector Matsumoto Masahiro,
criminal Investigation Section, Osaka Prefectural Police.
and I do speak fucking English.
would you ask the superintendent...
were there any witnesses at the airport, please?
the superintendent said it's possible.
Yeah, it's possible. Manned space flight's possible.
manned space" what"?
am I missing something here? - Everything, kid.
he says he's tired from the flying. Jet lag.
can I get some coffee, please? You want...
two coffees. - Coffee it is.
we are wasting valuable time here, okay?
now, if you tell us who this Sayto guy is, what the meet was about in New York, then maybe we can help you with this airport thing.
did you translate every word? I want every word translated.
you understand? - Yes, I understand.
because of your negligence, a man we've wanted for a long time has been lost.
you do not have to drink tea, but you should apologize.
our negligence, huh?
did we let the people carrying your documents, wearing your uniforms, waltz into a secure area?
look, we'll take some of the heat for this, but we're not taking the rap.
rap? - The...
the bite, the fall. Come on, Charlie. - Try blame.
blame, blame, blame.
this document is an insurance policy.
the guy speaks English.
the police will find you a... - Very well.
superintendent Ohashi... - Hey, we are the police, Charlie.
you are foreigners, nothing more than interested observers.
go home, Detective.
you know, I'm about an uptown minute of throwing you an international incident...
that's gonna make your head spin.
until you sign off on this dickhead, his ass is mine.
so we either work on this thing together or I'm going to the press,
I'm going to the embassy... I'm gonna fire up such a shit storm...
you're gonna wish you never heard my name!
all right, gentlemen. You can stay. - Thank you.
by the way, you have to leave your guns.
Hey, Superintendent, we are police officers.
you are civilians here.
it is illegal for you to carry a gun.
that's bullshit. What are you... - We understand.
Nicky, the gun.
happy? - All your guns, gentlemen.
the wise guy.
all right, you assign us a cop who speaks English, knows his way around the streets and can find his ass with two hands.
what?
he wants to say he wants a tough motherfucker.
of course, Detective. - Good.
you will have one of our top officers. - Thank you.
we're in good shape here. Either that or he's working on the dinner menu.
it's been a gas, chief.
Hey, where's our cop?
it is my honor.
stay close, please, Detectives.
can we take... Can we take a look at him?
just a moment.
Yes, please.
this is one of the phony cops at the airport.
are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.
he's got no defensive wounds.
nice, clean, right-handed cut.
and he's a fresh puppy.
perpetrator could be wet.
look at this.
nice. Maybe he's got two fives for a ten.
superintendent thanks you very much. We should go.
wait, wait. Wait a minute. Wait.
you wanna tell us what's going on? I mean, fill us in.
sato doing his own guy or what? - Please, don't interfere.
I've been ordered to take you to your hotel.
I am not interfering. This is what I do for a job.
what do I look like, chopped liver?
Nicky, we're gonna get more from a quiet look around than a fight.
you are just observers.
I usually get kissed before I get fucked.
what did he say?
foreplay. He likes a little foreplay.
detective! - Mas, relax.
he's not gonna break anything he can't pay for.
you gotta put peroxide on that. That'll get rid of the bloodstain.
what are you? - Detective Sergeant Conklin,
homicide, New York.
so, how'd you get that blood?
the girls wanna know if you're the guy that lost Sato at the airport.
just off the plane, you make the evening news.
very impressive.
americans who are less than perfect, it's very amusing to them.
could I talk to you for a minute, please?
you still didn't tell me how you got the blood.
the girl who found the body was just a little bit upset.
so I put my arms around her.
wouldn't you? - Yeah.
you got a cigarette? - Sure.
where you from? You from Boston? - Chicago.
Where'd you learn how to speak Japanese?
Chicago.
so, did you know the victim?
a couple guys came in here for a drink and this is how it turned out.
how about the killer? Did you see the killer leave?
Yeah, sure, and he wrote his name and address down...
on the back of my dress and he asked me to give it to you.
anything else?
what are you busting my ass for?
cause you could get me killed, Detective.
you see, there's a war going on here and they don't take prisoners.
what are you talking about?
between Sato and an old-time boss, a guy named Sugai.
who knows about this?
counting you and me? - Yeah.
eleven million.
did that woman tell you anything, Detective Conklin?
why the hell would she tell me anything?
I'm an observer.
you tell Ohashi I'll report to him when he's ready to report to me.
I'm a police officer just like you, Detective.
bullshit. You're a suit.
go tell Ohashi one good hand job deserves another.
I don't understand.
mas...
Hey, Charlie, get your map out, will you, babe? Find the directions to the hotel.
don't you want a ride? - We'll walk.
what I want is a complete file on Sato, all right?
a full report on what the hell happened here tonight...
and all other relevant information to this case translated by 0900 tomorrow.
you got that, Matsumoto? - Very well.
well, thank you.
five blocks? - Let's go, Charlie. Come on.
you'll have a long walk home.
fine. If I get lost, we'll call a cop.
what?
I mean, I like the guy. I mean, I don't know why they wouldn't...
fill us in on a simple gang war, but I like the guy.
so, what's happening, baby?
tell me in four blocks, we're walking 20 minutes here.
now, wait a second, Mr. We'll-Walk-Home-To-The-Hotel.
what do I look like? I work at the fucking UN?
you got no idea where the goddamn hotel is.
Mr. Conklin, is this an appropriate time to ask you...
what's going down with Oliver?
Yeah, some suits back home think I cut a deal with Sato.
they're full of shit.
Hey, they're gonna believe what they wanna believe.
well, don't worry about it. I'll back you up.
what the hell's going on here?
what? What?
what's your problem?
I don't know, Nicky.
something tells me we should cut our losses...
and let the locals handle it around here.
I can't go back without him, Charlie.
sato Koji.
he started young and rose quickly, from street enforcer to minor boss.
he controlled some of the docks and some construction in Hawaii.
okay. Victim last night was one of Sayto's guys, right?
right. - Sato's.
sato, right.
and six hours earlier, he's suspected of putting a hit on this guy...
okada Genkuro, damascene maker. An artist.
he's an engraver.
forty-eight hours later, he's snapping caps at Scalari's.
Masa, who's the monkey here with Sayto?
Sato.
sato, Sayto.
Sugai Kunio, top oyabun.
like your mafia bosses.
construction, gambling, extortion.
what's Sugai doing with Sayto?
I don't know. - I don't believe...
wait, wait. Mas, wait one second.
look, even I know that Sayto used to be the lieutenant for Sugai.
now there's a war going on between the two of them.
I mean, they're knocking each other off left and right.
Oh, these goddamn suits, man.
mas, what's with the SWATs out here?
exercise.
exercise?
training, perhaps. - Come on, Mas.
you're gonna have to start cutting us in here.
the thing is, Charlie, I can't figure out...
what's in that box at Scalari's, you know?
this guy Sugai into drugs? - No drugs.
steel. Liquor. - Nicky.
horses. He owns part of Club Miyako.
matsumoto. - Yes.
what's going on outside?
they have a tip about Sato's last hide-out.
Oh, they have a tip. - They got a tip.
it's only a tip. - It's only a tip, Nick.
I promise I will keep you informed, okay?
you promise? - Yes.
that's good enough. - All right.
you got that file on Sato's guy...
Sekimitsu? Yes, sir. - Sekimitsu. Yes.
Yeah. - Good.
police observers!
it's okay! It's okay!
please. I need authorization.
no. It's only a tip, Mas. It's only a tip. Come on.
let's go! Let's all tip!
training exercise.
observers! - You got it.
observers! - Okay, okay.
isn't that the guy from the airport?
that's one of the guys, right? - Yeah, it's him.
easy, Nicky.
Hi, sweetheart.
you remember me, don't you?
so where's your boss?
Nicky, what are you doing?
I only wanna talk to the man... - What are you doing?
...for five minutes. That's all I wanna do.
it's not proper. It's not proper. You're a foreigner.
this isn't New York. We have rules here.
you have rules here, huh? Hey, look, pal,
I've seen Sato's work, okay? He ain't following your program.
you must learn patience. - Oh, fuck patience.
he was here.
I know it.
gentlemen, we have to go.
we're observing, Mas. Just observing.
can I take a quick look?
Charlie.
you get something? - Yeah, I got something.
we gotta share it with Mas. He's in deep shit with his boss.
okay.
you don't want to eat that shit, do you?
put it there. - Hand me that stick.
son of a bitch.
always said you're the best.
I owe you lunch, babe. - Okay, babe.
Where's Mas?
Hey! Mas!
we got good news for you, babe.
what the fuck's his problem?
I will have no more to do with you.
please get out.
look, what are you talking about? I know you took a little heat for taking us on the raid...
superintendent Ohashi is waiting for you.
we understand. We're gonna square you with Ohashi, Mas.
let us explain what happened.
you've dishonored me and our department.
you are a thief.
I saw you take the money.
you saw me take the money, huh?
you know what it's like trying to get something done around here.
I've informed Ohashi of your crime.
he has spoken to your captain in New York.
we know the kind of man you are.
you dumb fuck! You don't know one thing about me, all right? Listen!
it's you and your self-righteous bullshit, man, it's gonna cost me my goddamn job.
Hey! Hey! I'm talking to you!
if you pull it, you better use it.
all right. Watch this, okay?
I only want to do this once.
all right. Look at this. Come here. Look.
see how the impression part leaves the ashes?
it's because there wasn't enough pressure.
it should be higher.
now, this is good. This is as good as it comes, but this ain't money.
I don't know about the box at the club.
could've been samples, could've been plates, but you guys got a counterfeiting war going on.
and you, pal, should talk to your partner before you go to the suits, okay?
so, fuck you very much.
we were gonna cut you in on the deal, Mas.
don't say you never had a good time.
don't say you never had a good time with Charlie Vincent.
all right! Kanpai, guys!
Where's that American girl?
you know, the American girl that was here, you know, the one that was here. Is she around tonight? You know, the...
Mas!
come here, baby.
join us! Come on!
Oh, baby, what is it? It's still moving in my mouth.
good evening.
matsumoto the Mountie, huh?
I haven't taken the silverware, babe, all right?
so why don't you just go take a hike.
come on, Nicky, what are you doing? Mas, sit down. Join us.
superintendent Ohashi would like to see you in the morning.
superintendent Ohashi would like to see me.
give me a break.
mas, can you smoke a little peace pipe here, guys?
everybody was doing the right thing, right?
we're all partners now. Mas, please join us.
relax and have a good time. Please, sit down.
come on, Mas.
thank you.
masahiro Matsumoto, a famous detective!
famous detective!
Conklin, I did my duty.
these are the men I work for.
like I told you, pal, you talk to your partners first before you go to the suits.
okay? - Come on, Nicky.
perhaps you should think less of yourself and more of your group.
try to work like a Japanese.
listen. I grew up with your soldiers. You were wise then.
now, music and movies are all America is good for!
right? We make the machines.
we built the future. We won the peace.
and if there was one of you guys who had an original idea, you'd be so tight...
you couldn't even pull it out of your ass!
what the hell's going on here? What are you guys?
you got to argue all the time?
see you later. - Come on, Nicky.
what is this? A conspiracy to fuck up my evening?
what the hell's the problem here?
mas, what are you doing?
this is good-time time, Mas. Okay?
you know, kanpai time? - Kanpai.
up and down, huh? - Up and down! In and out!
okay, kanpai.
Joyce. - Can I talk to you, please?
Jesus.
all right, Chicago, look, I need some help, all right?
my tit's in the ringer. I don't speak the goddamn language.
so give me a couple minutes.
you see that woman down there?
you give her $50 and you go where she takes you.
then I'll find you.
Hey, babe!
can we get a little mercy here?
some people are trying to eat. Thank you very much.
you like this stuff, huh, Mas?
Yes. - Yes?
that's Amore. - That's Amore!
I was a teenager when it was new.
and I was a teenager when it was old, Mas.
if you're gonna hang around with the NYPD, Mas, - there's one thing you gotta do for me. - What?
you're gonna have to lose the Kmart tie, babe. It's a fire hazard.
I'm gonna give you a little gift, straight from the Big Apple.
from Charlie Vincent to you.
Thanks. - It's my honor.
I like you.
Top-drawer, yes!
Top-drawer, yes. Top-drawer, no?
Hey, meatball! What are you doing?
if you can't hit the note, throw your hat on it, babe.
you could do better? - I cannot tell a lie.
Yes, I could do better.
then put it up or shut it up.
for you, from me.
thank you.
don't quit your day job.
that quick?
what you talk in about?
Hey!
Hey, What'd I Say, babe!
look at me, Mas.
ray Charles! - Yes!
you and me!
detective, wait!
masahiro Matsumoto, ladies and gentlemen!
you and me, baby.
masahiro Matsumoto, ladies and gentlemen!
osaka Prefectural Police Department!
if you're looking for Sato,
I can't help you.
he hasn't been here in over a year.
who would he do regularly?
and what makes you think I pay attention?
honey, I think you'd recognize if one of your customers had a different tie on.
he had a different girl every time...
and I don't know who he's doing regularly.
if that's where you're heading. - Is that Sugai, - the one going at it with Sato? - Right.
and the girl with sequins had blood on her hands.
you did your homework. - All right. How do I get to him?
look,
I've been living in this country for seven years...
and I still can't read the headlines.
yes means no, maybe means never.
you didn't answer my question. How do I get to him?
let the police handle it.
no one's gonna help a gaijin. - Gaijin?
Yeah, a stranger, a barbarian, a foreigner.
me and you.
more you.
gotta go. - Chicago, wait. Hold on.
you know, they got lights out there, Wrigley Field now, you know?
Yeah. Mom told me.
did she?
she say it's not stupid to be scared?
but you just can't stand still, and sometimes you got to choose a side.
I did.
I'm on my side.
all right, drinks cost $125. - 125 bucks.
how about the fish? - 200 bucks.
200 bucks! Holy shit!
how much do you think it'd cost if it was cooked?
did you pay for it? - No.
assistant Inspector Masahiro Matsumoto...
signed it over to the Osaka Prefectural Police Department.
best thing they've done for us since we've been here.
we was owed.
you like this guy, huh?
Mas? - Yeah.
he's okay.
what the hell's this?
come on, baby.
I don't know, Charlie. I can't figure this place out.
come out, babe. You want to play? You and me. Come on.
come on. Right here. Come on. Come on.
that's it. That's it. Come on. Right here.
Hey! Fuck!
good, Charlie. - Fuck me.
good move, babe. - Hey! Hey!
real good, Charlie. - Okay, good. Come on.
bring it back. We'll go again.
you, bring it back.
did you see that? - Don't get fucking personal, all right?
Hey, fuck you! - Hey!
Hey, Charlie. - Fuck!
Hey, Charlie, come on, it's only a goddamn coat!
he's got my fucking passport!
come here, you little fuck! Come here! - Oh, Jesus Christ.
come here, you fuck. Come here! Come here!
Hey, Charlie! Charlie!
Charlie!
you little shit!
Hey, Charlie!
come here! Come here!
fuck!
Oh, you little shit!
stay there, you little shit! Right there!
stay right there!
Oh, you little shit!
Oh, oh, you fuck. All right.
come on, babe! Let's go!
shit!
come on! Come on! Come on!
come on.
come on! Who's first?
come on!
Charlie!
get out of there, Charlie!
get out of there! Get away!
Charlie!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
you fuck!
Charlie!
get out of there!
Charlie!
you better come with me. Come on.
he should have known better. He...
he was raised in the city and...
see, my job...
you kind of see things the way they really are.
you don't have to see a person whole one minute and...
he was 28 years old.
may I speak to Nick-san alone?
sure.
I'm very sorry for your loss.
I thought maybe you should know.
I made all arrangements for Charlie.
thank you.
I feel... I feel that...
if I had been with you,
Charlie-san would...
it would not have happened.
I'm very sorry.
Charlie's things...
we have a tradition.
when someone close to us dies, we keep something personal of his.
can we do this another time?
please, Nick-san.
this is for you.
I can take anything I want?
anything.
I wanna go back to Sato's hide-out, okay?
just you and me.
there's always something, Mas.
always something.
Yeah.
he had himself a real nice party.
you feel safe?
well, feel safe!
I'm here!
Nick-san, there's nothing here.
we should go.
Masa.
sequins.
okay, here we go.
how can you be so sure? It could be any girl's dress.
sometimes you gotta forget your head and grab your balls.
balls?
balls. - Balls.
come on, hot dog. You're going to lose her. Come on.
all right. Let's keep in touch.
all right. Masa, Masa, come in. - Roger.
I got her. She's on the other side of the market.
I want you to bring the wheels around.
good? - Oh, yeah. This is great. Yeah.
pepper?
Oh, yeah. Thanks, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
big shot from New York, huh?
Nick-san. - Yeah?
there's something...
maybe I should not ask.
what? What? You can ask me anything you want, Masa.
what do you wanna know?
these disturbing things I hear about you in New York.
a couple of guys I used to work with in the department...
took some money from some drug dealers.
it's no big deal.
they stole?
they... They liberated funds.
theft is theft. There is no gray area.
Hey, Masa, New York is one big gray area, okay?
did you take money?
Yeah, I took money.
I'm not proud of it, okay? You know, I...
I had a divorce, I got kids, bills...
did Charlie-san know?
no.
he was a policeman, Nick.
if you steal, you disgrace him and yourself and me.
Thanks.
Masa, rise and shine, babe.
we got action.
she just went into the store over there.
there she goes.
just a little morning walk.
is that her? - Yeah.
she's getting a cab. Mas, grab a taxi.
Taxi!
wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
that's the guy that set up Charlie.
that's the switch.
let's go. - Okay.
you each have one plate.
one for the front of the bill and one for the back.
sato, have you brought the plate with you?
it is my only insurance.
if I had brought the plate, I would be a dead man.
better get your cops.
I sent one of the plates to America...
to prove the quality of my engraver's work.
this traitor took it from my representatives...
and then murdered them.
look at him!
he knows nothing of loyalty and respect.
my men respect me, Sugai-san.
I want my own territory.
your methods are crude and disgraceful.
you liked my methods well enough when they served you.
you must return the plate, then we can discuss your future.
I want to be an Oyabun...
of equal standing to others...
and I want my own territory...
far away from you.
not one Oyabun in all Japan would listen to such absurd demands.
how old are you, Sato?
do you want to live a little longer?
not as long as you, old man!
hold it!
here I am, Nick!
here!
almost as near as when you let Charlie die, huh?
he's getting away!
Jesus! - I told you, no guns.
I thought we were working together, god damn it!
he went right past you!
right past you, he went! Jesus Christ!
look! The guy's getting away!
wait. What's going on?
we are going to put you on a plane.
should you return, you'll be arrested.
on behalf of Northwest Airlines,
I would like to welcome you onboard.
we anticipate an on time departure for this flight.
masahiro Matsumoto?
thank you.
Hey, Masa.
Nick-san.
excuse me. Shoes.
shoes. - Oh.
it's not possible. You are gone.
you know me. I don't go quietly, Masa.
Thanks.
I need your help.
I'm sorry, but you should not have come.
you have done enough to him.
please pardon my son.
he came to comfort me, but all he does is show his disappointment.
you never even told me you had a son, Mas.
it doesn't matter.
I have been suspended, Nick-san.
I am no longer an assistant inspector.
Oh...
Jesus Christ.
I'm sorry, man. I... - No!
I knew what I was doing.
well, it's not over yet.
we can get him, Mas, you and me.
I cannot help you.
Nick-san, look at me. - We can fix it, Mas.
you cannot fix everything.
I am not like you.
for a moment, I thought I could be.
you can, all right. You didn't do anything wrong, okay?
we kicked ass. - It was for nothing.
Oh, come on, Masa. Come... - Nick-san.
I belong to a group.
they will not have me anymore.
you're digging a hole for yourself, Mas.
sometimes you got to go for it.
get out.
please.
Yeah. Joyce. I want to speak to... Joyce. Joyce-san. Yeah.
Where's Sugai, Joyce?
can I find him in the bar?
here's your food. Here's some cash.
what about Sugai?
you wanna find Sugai, this is where you'll find him.
he loves golf. He's here three times a week.
you always try and get rid of me, you know, yet you're...
you're always there.
I think sometime we're going to have to try to figure that one out.
you said you wouldn't give me any more trouble, remember?
Joyce.
I know you took a risk.
good luck, Nick.
how you doing, pal?
I want to talk to your friend Mr. Sugai.
ask him to give Sugai this.
what, are we going in there?
you should be somewhere over the Pacific now, Conklin.
we should be rid of you.
do you have any idea who I am?
Yeah, I know who you are.
no.
if you did, you wouldn't have given me this.
good stuff.
this is an old bill, a prototype.
the new ones will be like everything we make...
perfect.
perfect, huh?
so, who's going to get the profits? You?
or Sato?
see, I know he's got the other plate.
that means you've got nothing.
he might as well be an American.
his kind respect just one thing, money.
so what are you into it for? Love?
I was 10...
when the B-29 came.
my family lived underground for three days.
when we came up, the city was gone.
then the heat brought rain, black rain.
you made the rain black...
and shoved your values down our throat.
we forgot who we were.
you created Sato and the thousands like him.
I'm paying you back.
Hey, you want the plate? You get me close to him.
you have no part in this.
I promised the other oyabuns...
there would be peace.
they don't have to know.
I'm bound by duty and honor.
if you had time,
I would explain what that means.
Sugai-san.
I am the solution to your problems.
I can take him out. Okay?
I'm nothing but a worthless gaijin...
and everybody knows he killed my partner.
Yeah.
right in front of you.
I'm not impressed.
you get me close, I'll hit the mark...
and you're going to be clean.
why should I trust you?
because you got nothing to lose.
four oyabuns will arrive here shortly...
with their bodyguards.
sato will also have a lieutenant.
but sometimes you have to go for it.
Thanks, pal.
this is not a farmer.
what?
this is one of Sato's men.
he's got his own double cross going on.
wonder how many of these other guys are his men.
okay, I'm going in. - What?
I'm going in. You cover the front, all right?
you can do it. Okay, Mas? You can do it.
sato, sit here.
you must learn to value our Yakuza code over your individual desires.
if I am granted the recognition I deserve...
my loyalty will set a new standard.
Where's the plate?
Where's the other plate?
in a safe place.
Sato.
first you must accept responsibility...
for your past deeds...
by making amends in the traditional manner.
if you refuse, there will be no truce!
now come sit beside me.
we will toast our truce.
take the cup.
I got him!
shit.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
so you made the news again. - Yeah.
you're a regular hero.
so, what did you decide? Are you going to stay here?
I don't know.
a love-hate relationship can last a very long time.
Yeah.
I want to thank you.
for what? - For choosing a side.
you're welcome.
hot pepper? - No, thanks.
...Flight 159 for Tokyo and Washington, D. C. now boarding at Gate 4.
come on, don't give me that sad look.
you know, they never found the plates.
not in the house, not in the road.
well, some lucky bastard, he's probably set for life.
I don't think I understand.
if you got the two plates and you know the right people, then all your problems are solved.
I mean, who's ever going to know?
this is final boarding announcement for Northwest...
I'm getting good at this, huh?
...Flight 26, service to Detroit and New York, please proceed to Gate 5.
I don't want you coming to the gate, okay?
Why?
because I know you. You're gonna... You're going to get sentimental.
it's embarrassing.
Nick-san.
what did you get me? A bento box?
I can eat it on the airplane instead of that American shit.
no. It's for your kids.
Thanks.
Oh, I got something here for you.
no, Nick-san.
good friends do this.
you watch your tail, cowboy.
Nick-san!
in China...
in the Portuguese island of Macao...
there lived, toward the end of the last century, an immensely rich merchant...
whose name was Mister Clay.
he had a magnificent house and a splendid equippage.
and he sat in the midst of both, erect, silent and alone.
amongst the other Europeans he had the name of an iron hard man and a miser.
clay bankrupted his own partner Louis Ducrot
clay quarreled, Ducrot tried to start up on his own.
but old Clay wouldn't hear of that.
Oh, no. He brought him to his knees.
ruined him, eh? - Ruined him?
him and his family were thrown right out onto the street.
it would be a little manner of 300 Guineas.
but Louis Ducrot couldn't pay...
and that was the end of it. - It was the end of Louis.
he committed suicide. - And his family?
well, there was a daughter some place but she ran away with a sea captain.
and, of course, old Clay had taken over the house. Poor Louis!
he'd been proud of that house. - Proud? The objects of art in it.
he smashed and burned up every one of them before he left.
he said that nothing meant for the embellishment of life would ever consent to live with the new master of that house.
except the looking glasses... the ones he brought from France.
those mirrors had reflected only happy and affectionate scenes
it would be his murderer's punishment, he said, to meet, wherever he went, the portrait of a hangman.
Mr. Clay sat down to dine in solitude.
face to face with his portrait.
he was not aware of any lack of friendliness in his surroundings.
the idea of friendliness had never entered his scheme of life.
it was only natural that things should be as they were because he had willed them to be so...
for Mister Clay had come to have faith in his own omnipotence.
when he was seventy, he had fallen ill with the gout.
he couldn't sleep at night. His head clerk would sit up with him and read aloud the bills, estimates and contracts of his business.
this brought back to Mr. Clay, the schemes and triumphs of the past.
but the nights were long.
we have read this one, too, Mr. Clay.
read twice before.
I have read to you all of the old account books twice over.
shall I start again?
there are other kinds of books.
haven't you heard of them? - Other kinds of books?
besides account books there are other things which people sometimes read.
I am accustomed to getting you the things you want, Mr Clay,
if these books exist, I must look out for them.
the night isn't over.
what's that?
in the party of Jews who took me with them fleeing from Poland there was a very old man.
before he died, he gave me this.
here, Mr. Clay, is something that I shall read to you.
"the wilderness and the solitary places shall be glad, "and the desert shall rejoice and blossom - "In synch even with joy ..." - That's not a book.
strengthen ye the weak hand ... - That's not a book at all.
it's what you have asked for. Something beside the account books.
"strengthen ye their weak hands and confirm their feeble knees"
Where'd you get it? - "say to them that are fearful hearted:
behold your God will come with a recompense.'
"then the eyes of the blind shall be opened ""and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped."
"then shall the lame man leap as a hart"
"and in the wilderness shall waters break out."
what was all that?
has it happened?
no.
is it happening now?
no.
who put that thing together? - The prophet Isaiah.
the prophet!
I don't like prophecies.
people should only record things when they've already happened.
this prophet of yours, when did he live?
Oh, about a thousand years ago, Mr. Clay.
say that again, about the lame man.
"then lame man shall leap as a hart"
"and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped."
is anybody doing anything to make these things happen?
this is a prophecy, Mr. Clay!
where are you going? - To get the account book, Mr. Clay.
you don't want me to read to you any more from the account books?
people can record things outside of account books, things which have already happened.
do you know what such a record is called?
a story. - Yes, Mr. Clay.
I heard a story once when I first came out here to China.
one of the sailors told the others about a thing which had happened to him.
he told them a story.
a sailor was walking by himself near a harbor when a carriage drove up and a rich old gentleman said to him.
"you are a fine looking sailor. Would you like to earn 5 Guineas"?
the sailor naturally answered "yes" and the rich old gentleman drove him to his house and gave him food and wine and said to him: "I am very rich.
"I'm very old and I don't trust the people ,""who will inherit what I've saved up all my life."
"three years ago I married a young wife."
"but she's been no good to me."
"I've got no child."
with your permission, Mr. Clay, I also can tell that story.
what's that?
the old gentleman led the sailor to a bedroom which was lighted with candlesticks of pure gold.
was it not so, Mr. Clay?
in the room there was a bed and in the bed there was a lady.
the old gentleman took from his purse a piece of gold.
a 5 Guinea piece, Mr. Clay, and handed it to the sailor.
how do you come to know this story? - I've sailed on many ships, Mr. Clay.
you can't have known the sailor on my ship.
these things happened to him many years ago.
he'd be an old man by now.
coming here to China, Mr. Clay, you travelled on only one ship.
so you heard the story only once.
what's that got to do with my story? - From Gravesend to Lisbon, there was a sailor on that ship who told the story.
on my way to Singapore, I heard another sailor tell that story.
the story they tell never happended and that's why it is told. It never will happen, Mr. Clay.
I don't like prophecies.
Yes, Mr. Clay.
Goodnight, Mr. Clay.
I don't like pretense. I don't like prophecies.
I like facts!
if this story has never happened, I'm going to make it happen now.
you think I can't do what I want to do?
Mr. Clay, I think you can do whatever you want.
I want the story which I told you to happen.
Yes, Mr. Clay.
I want it to happen in real life to real people.
Yes, Mr. Clay. To real people.
where do you want it to happen. - Here. In my own house.
I want to see it all with my own eyes.
I want to dine with the sailor in my dining room
I want to pick him out myself in the street by the harbor.
it will involve expenses. - Yes. It's going to cost us some money.
you remember there's a woman in the story.
the young miss, I shall not be able to get you.
I'm paying you to do this work for me...
and it will be part of your work to find me this woman.
Yes, Mr. Clay.
I shall have to think it over.
but he had already been thinking it over.
this old man, he thought, is going mad.
from this moment, he realized that he was indispensible to his master.
he did not intend to derive any advantage from this, but the idea pleased him.
this clerk might well have been a highly dangerous person except that ambition, desire, in any form had been washed and bleached and burnt out of him.
he had no yearning for love in him.
no fear. And no wish to fight.
he was like some kind of insect: hard to crush, even to the heel of a boot.
and yet, there were things not yet to be recounted which moved like big deep water fish in the depths of his dark mind.
he had only one passion: a craving to be left alone.
his soul was concentrated on this one request, that he might he might enter his little room and shut his door with the security that, here, no one in the world could possibly follow him.
by the next day, he had decided on the heroine for the story.
in the town, she was called Virginie.
she was the mistress of another clerk in Mr. Clay's establishment, - A young man named Simpson. - Charlie?
you remember, he asked me to buy you a shawl.
so I brought you some of them so you could choose the one you like.
Yes. Charlie didn't want to be seen in the shops buying such things for a woman.
word of that might have got back to his family in Europe. So he sent you.
I don't suppose you've got a family in Europe? What's your name?
Levinsky. Elishama Levinsky.
I won't ask you what you want of me. You can tell me when you feel like it.
if you know Charlie, I suppose you work with him at the office...
for the old American? - Yes, Miss Virgine.
how is he? The old man? I heard he was sick.
he's no well, Miss Virginie. He does not leave his house.
good. Is he going to die?
Oh, no.
at least he is strong enough to make up new schemes.
with your permission, I'll tell you one of them.
he dislikes pretense. He dislikes prophecies.
he likes facts.
facts? - Yes.
but 50 years ago, on a ship, he heard a story told.
a sailor was walking by himself near the harbor when a rich old gentleman drove up in a carriage and said to him:
"you are a fine looking sailor. Do you want earn 5 Guineas tonight"?
that was in Benin. - Yes?
not here in Macao.
I heard it from a friend of mine, an Englishman, merchant captain.
it happened to a sailor that he knew when he first went to sea.
miss Virginie, this is a story that lives on ships. All sailors have told it.
it might have been left on sea and never come ashore if it hadn't been for Mr. Clay.
he made up his mind to have it happen in real life to real people in order that one sailor in the world shall be able to tell it, from begining to end, as it actually happened to him.
if he wants to play a comedy, a comedy with the devil, it's a matter between the two of them.
what's it to me? - Yes! A comedy. I'd forgotten the word.
there are three people in Mr. Clay's comedy.
the old gentleman, he will play himself and the young sailor...
he will himself find by the harbor.
but if an English merchant captain has told you this, Miss Virginie, he will have told you that besides these two there's also a beautiful, young lady.
on Mr. Clay's behalf, I am now looking for this beautiful, young lady.
if she will come into this comedy and finish it for him,
Mr. Clay will pay her 100 Guineas.
old Clay has got some pretty strange ideas of a comedy.
in a comedy, the actors pretend to kill one another... or to die...
or to go to bed with their lovers.
they don't really do any of these things.
you're master's like the Emperor Nero of Rome who had people eaten up by lions.
yes? - Yes. Just to amuse himself.
but since then it hasn't been done. - And was the Emperor Nero very rich?
Oh... he owned all the world.
and were his comedies good? - He liked them himself, I suppose.
but nowadays, who would he get to play in them?
if he owned all the world, he would get people to play in them.
what does he pay you? 30 pieces of silver?
I am in Mr. Clay's employ. I cannot dare go anywhere but with him.
but you, Miss Virginie, you can go wherever you like.
Yes. I suppose so. - Yes. You suppose so.
but you have been able to go wherever you like all your life.
I was so angry with my life today that I was planning to end it.
but now you are angry with me.
miss Virginie,
Mr. Clay is prepared to pay 100 Guineas if on the night appointed by him, you will come to his house.
to his house? - Yes. To his house.
do you know what house that is? It's my father's house.
I played in it when I was a little girl.
that house was the only thing left me from the time when I was rich and pretty and innocent.
the heroine of Mr. Clay's story is rich, pretty, and innocent.
all of these years, whenever I walked past it,
I've dreamt of how I'd enter it once more.
you are to enter it again, Miss Virginie.
no.
I will not go into this house, Mr. Levinsky.
you've been here before. It's not very much of a place, is it?
no.
I shouldn't think you'd be used to much better.
I live by the harbor near the company quarters.
Mr. Clay's company!
it's true.
you're an important man - No! Miss Virginie.
you run the old man's office for him.
you have all of his affairs in your own hands.
you live in a house on the Praia Grande?
a room. - A room.
I wonder what it's like.
did you have a home when you were a child?
no. - - I thought so.
you knew him, didn't you? - No, Miss Virginie.
his name was Ducrot. He was my father.
it's not the name you use now, Miss Virginie.
your father died before I came to China.
he killed himself.
that's not my mother. It's the Empress Eugenia of France.
we used to talk, my father and I, of great, splendid, noble things.
he told me how the Empress wore her white satin shoes one single time only then made a present of them to the common schools for the little girls to wear to their first communion.
I was to have done the same thing.
Papa was so proud of my small feet.
the Empress made a great career for herself.
she said to the Emperor that the way to her bedroom ran through the cathedral of Notre Dame.
and the way to my bedroom?
lately, it's been through offices and counting houses.
we go where we are told, Miss Virginie.
what does he really want, the old man? - To demonstrate his omnipotence, to do the thing which cannot be done.
and yet, you said the Emperor of Rome owned all of the world.
but the people down there, going north, south, east, west,
how many would be going at all if they hadn't been told to go by Mr. Clay and the other rich merchants like him?
now, Mr. Clay has told you to go to his house and you will have to go.
I suppose that nobody could insult you even if they tried.
why should I let them?
and if I told you to get out of this house?
when I'd gone. you'd sit here and think of the things for which you sent me away.
didn't you say you had no family in Europe?
there was a pogrom, Miss Virginie. They were killed in the pogrom.
but you escaped and came to China? - I was in many places first:
frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Lisbon...
well, you're here now. - Yes, Miss Virginie.
I see now...
who you are.
I thought you were a small rat out of Mr. Clay's storehouse.
I travelled once, myself... for a while.
an English captain...
the one who told me your story.
he took me to Japan.
on our first night, there was an earthquake.
the earth trembled and shook at the loss of my innocence.
in the shawls, Miss Virginie - In the shawls?
Yes. In the other I once brought here for you to choose from...
in each, there is a pattern. A pattern in all of them.
only sometimes the line goes the other way from what you expect. As in a looking glass.
with money to travel with, you can make a career for yourself.
no less than the Empress of France.
only on this pattern, the road runs around the other way.
and, why not, Miss Virginie?
and you said you didn't know my father? Or anything about him?
this is the motto on our family's coat of arms:
that means, "Why not," Miss Virginie?
tell Mr. Clay for me that I won't come for the price he's offered me.
my price is 300 Guineas. That's the pattern.
or in terms he'll understand, the known debt.
is that your last word, Miss Virginie? - Yes.
your very last word? - Yes.
here is 300 Guineas.
he was sure to go mad at the end with all his sins.
rich traders and merchants, they're all mad.
in one way or the other, this thing will be the end of him.
yes? - Yes, Miss Virginie.
but now he may think that the pursuit of a story is even more interesting than the pursuit of money.
do you want a receipt?
no, Miss Virginie.
young sailor!
my master here in this carriage wishes to speak to you.
he says, would you like to earn 5 Guineas tonight?
come!
you're a fine looking sailor.
would you like to earn 5 Guineas tonight?
you're a fine looking sailor, my young friend.
would you like to earn 5 Guineas tonight?
Yes, I want to earn 5 Guineas.
I was thinking about it just now... in what way I was to earn 5 Guineas.
get into my carriage. I'll tell you more at my house.
no. Your carriage is too fine. My clothes are too dirty and tarred.
I shall run beside.
and I can go as fast as you can.
he's young, eh Levinsky?
he's full of the juices of life.
he has blood in him. I suppose he's got tears.
he longs... yearns for the things which dissolve people...
for friendship and love.
such things, a man's bones have dissolved.
once I broke with a partner of mine when I wouldn't allow him to become my friend.
it dissolved my bones.
do you think he's ever seen gold? - He will have heard of it.
hold out your hand.
that's what you're going to earn tonight.
it's a 5 Guinnea piece.
it's gold.
and gold, my young sailor: it's solid. It's hard.
it's proof against dissolution.
you're a poor sailor and I'm a rich old man.
my name in China is worth more money than you've ever heard of.
in America, when they name me they name a million dollars.
that million dollars, that's me...
myself... my days... my years.
my life.
and soon the time will come when one half of me must go and the other half, my million dollars, will live on.
but where?
it occurs to me that it might give me pleasure to leave my possessions to a child.
a child which I myself have caused to exist.
caused to exist as I've begotten my fortune.
the starving coolies in the tea fields, they didn't know they were contributing to the making of it.
for them, it was only the pain in their hands and the poor copper coins of their wages.
in my brain and by my will, many things were brought together to make up one single thing.
a million dollars.
I'm not just now in the habit of talking to rich old people.
to tell you the truth, old master, I'm not just now in the habit of talking to anyone at all.
a fortnight ago, when the Scooner picked me up,
I hadn't spoken a word for a whole year.
my own ship went down in a storm.
and, of all her crew, I alone was cast ashore on an island.
tonight, it's no more than three weeks since I walked down the beach of my island.
yes...
all of this must be a change for you.
Yes, this house is very different from my island.
well, I'll soon get used to talking again. I've talked before.
I'm not such a fool as I look. - No, my young friend.
I'm gonna tell you why I fetched you here.
I know.
I know what you're going to tell me old master. I've heard it beforeï¼every word.
it's hard on you being so old and dry.
but I shall know well enough what I'm doing.
he's very young, is he? - The sailor boy? Oh, yes!
Mr. Clay is highly satisfied with his catch on the behalf of Macao.
very likely, there's not another fish of just that kind to be caught there.
but if he stays until dawn, he'll see the truth on my face:
that it's old!
Mr. Clay and the sailor boy are making ready.
old and powdered and ruined - They are entertaining one another.
just as you are now preparing yourself for your own part.
the heroine's part in Mr. Clay's story. - Yes?
the story is making headway.
but one way or another, you said, it's going to be the end of him.
no man in the world can take a story which people have invented and told and make it happen.
do you think he's going to die tonight? In his malice?
add up a column of figures.
you start at the lowest figure and move left.
but if a man took it into his head to add up a column the other way, from the left, what would he find?
his total would come out wrong, Miss Virginie. Hmm?
his account books would be worth nothing.
Mr. Clay's total will come out wrong and be worth nothing.
these shells. I picked them up every morning along the shore.
I'm going to take them to Denmark.
they're the only things I've got to take home with me.
some are beautiful... perhaps even rare.
here, poor sailor. It's nothing to you that you're contributing to the fine bafflement of my relations in America who have been on the lookout all these years for the rich legacy from China.
may they sleep well on that!
were the nights long on your island?
as long as the days.
the days came, then the nights, then the days...
I had my knife with me.
I cut a mark with it in the bark of a big tree every time I saw a new moon.
there were nine new moons before they rescued me.
what did you think about at night?
of a boat, mostly. A good, strong, sea-worthy boat.
she needn't be big. No more than five per stage.
and when I met you tonight old gentleman and you asked me if I'd earn 5 Guineas, - that was why I went with you. - Didn't you think about women?
Yes.
on the ships I've sailed on, the others talked about their girls.
I know. I know very well what you're paying me to do tonight.
I'm as good as any sailor.
you'd have no reason to complain of me.
your lady waiting here for me. She would have no reason to complain of me.
all the same, I may as well now go back to my ship.
and you, my old gentleman, will take on another sailor for you job.
no. I don't want you to go back to your ship.
you... you've been cast away on a desert island.
you haven't spoken to a human being for a year.
I'd hate to think about that.
I'll take no other sailor for my job.
and your boat?
thank you, old master, for the food and the wine.
is there a boat you want to buy?
good night, old gentleman. - How are you going to buy it?
now you've given back your 5 Guinnea piece and going away.
that boat will never come to be launched.
it will never come to sail.
this was my father's bedroom.
I was allowed to play here on Sunday mornings.
he seems so far away, my father.
he's back with me tonight.
I've entered this old house with his consent.
I was a little girl the last time I looked in this mirror.
I used to ask it to show me what I'd be like in years to come.
I think for the first time in his life, Mr. Clay will be impressed - by a woman's beauty. - He mustn't look at me.
how can he help it? - I mustn't look at him.
it's the time for acting the story. He will be coming soon.
no, no. I dare not.
let me go. Please let me go.
he's paid you, Miss Virginie.
Mr. Levinsky!
my father...
on the last day of his life...
an hour or so, before he killed himself, he called me to him.
all our misery had risen from the moment he first set eyes on the face of Mr. Clay, so he bound me by a solemn vow, never... in any place or under any circumstance...
to look into that face again.
you will not have to look at it.
the downcast eyes of the heroine in the story will bear witness to her modesty.
who knows?
the prophet Isaiah may now have laid hands on his head and turned Mr. Clay into a child.
perhaps he's beginning to play with his story.
I may play with it, too.
how do you know I won't set fire to this house in the morning before I leave it again...
and burn your master in it?
I know this much:
I've been with him for seven years and now I'll lose my situation.
you're so sure that this comedy of his will be the end of him?
I'm sure of it, too.
he was my father's deadly enemy.
this night will bring about the final judgment.
my humiliation, my disgrace will provide the conclusive evidence against him.
you're the most beautiful girl in the world.
how old are you?
are you 17?
Yes.
then you and I are the same age.
you're young. Both of you... young.
you're in fine health. Your limbs don't ache.
you sleep at night because you move without pain.
you think you move at your own will.
not so.
you move at my bidding.
you're two young, strong and lusty jumping jacks in this old hand of mine.
I've got something to tell you.
never...
I've never 'til tonight slept with a girl.
I've thought about it often.
I've meant to do it many times.
but I've never done.
it wasn't all my own fault. I've been away for a long time.
in a place a long way off, where there weren't any girls.
what's your name? - Virginie.
when I was on that island far from here...
I sometimes fancied I had a girl with me who was mine
I brought her birds' eggs and fish and some big sweet fruits that grew there and she was kind to me.
we slept together in a cave that I found.
when the full moon rose, it shone into it.
but I couldn't think of a name for her. I didn't remember any girl's name.
Virginie...
Virginie...
Virginie.
for god's sake! Get up! We must get up. There's an earthquake.
don't you feel the earthquake?
no. It's not an earthquake.
tonight... in that room...
in that bed...
they, themselves, for that same young, hot blood in them...
it's all nothing but a story.
my story.
listen!
the birds are singing.
Yes, they're singing.
on the boats, I sometimes made a song.
what were your songs about?
about the sea and the lives of the sailors. ...and their deaths.
sing one of them to me.
"as I was keeping the middle watch, and the night was cold" , "three swans flew across the moon, over her round face of gold" .
gold!
a 5 Guinnea piece is like the moon and then not at all like her...
did you make other songs?
when the sky's brown and the sea yawns, three thousand fathoms down, "and the boat runs downward like a whale, "still Paul Velling will not turn pale.
then... your name is Paul? - Yes, Paul. It's not a bad name.
my father was named Paul and his father, too.
it's the name of good seamen, faithful to their ship.
my father drowned six months before I was born.
he's down there in the sea.
but... you're not going to drown, are you, Paul?
Oh, maybe not.
but I've many times wondered what my father thought of when the sea took him, at last, altogether.
do you like to think of that sort of thing?
Yes.
it's good to think of the storms on the high seas.
it's not bad to think of death.
I have to go back to my ship as soon as it grows light.
now there's one sailor who can tell his story from beginning to end as it actually happened.
but what about those other sailors?
what ever happened to them?
and why did they tell it?
maybe it's like that prophecy of yours.
how'd it go?
"in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert" , "the parched ground shall become a pool" .
he must have lived in a country where it didn't rain very much.
in England, where the ground is nearly always a pool they wouldn't appreciate it.
tell me the rest.
"behold your God will come with the recompense" , "and some in sighing shall flee away" .
prophecies! Get up a new financial scheme and you must prove on paper that the shareholders are gonna double their money or triple it.
that never happens but you've got to prove it or people aren't going to invest.
it's like that with the sailors.
they're poor, so they tell about a rich house.
they're lonely, so they tell about a beautiful lady.
that story couldn't happen.
but it's happened to them.
say that again.
about the lame man.
"then shall the lame man, leap like a hart" .
the eyes of the blind shall be opened.
prophecies!
you're coming home with me and we'll sleep together every night...
like tonight.
you can't do that. He's paid you.
what?
your man has paid you.
he paid you to go at dawn and you took his money.
you'll have your boat. - Yes, I shall have the boat.
was that what you said?
but you?
what is going to happen to you, my girl?
old gentleman, will you remember to do something for me?
she's got so many fine things, she would not care to have a lot of shells lying about.
but this one is rare, I think.
perhaps there's not another one like it in all the world.
it's as smooth and silky as a knee.
and when you hold it to your ear there is a sound in it.
a song.
you'll remember to tell her to hold it to her ear?
thank you, old gentleman.
and good bye.
now you can tell your story. - What story?
all that's happened to you from yesterday evening till now.
all that I've seen and done?
why do you call it a story?
you are the one sailor in the world who can tell the story truthfully as it happened to you.
to whom would I tell it?
who in the world would believe me if I told it?
I would not tell it for a hundred times 5 Guineas.
he's dead, Miss Virginie.
he's been waiting at sunrise to drink of the cup of his triumph but the cup has been too strong for him.
it's very hard on people who want things so badly that they can't do without them.
and if they can't get these things, it is hard.
and when they do get them, surely, it is very hard.
I have heard it before long ago.
but where?
this is great.
there's got to be 7 or 8 feet up there.
and 80 years of dust.
look at all this height.
with our bedroom upstairs we'd have all this space.
for what? Just space.
and 4?
and 5?
watch it. Watch it.
God this place is huge.
it's beautiful.
you guys it's absolutely incredible. Incredible.
a little paint you could sell this tomorrow and double your money.
Carl, you're obsessed. A little bit.
whoa, look!
Hey, it's an Indian head penny.
1898.
it's a good omen.
you're the good omen.
it's so great.
I had Rose move your 3:00 to 4:00.
Gary Allen called late yesterday.
he has to see you about the final painting bids for the loft.
3:00 is the only time he can make it.
Sam?
I'm sorry.
relax. This isn't brain surgery you're going into.
pitching these Japanese guys makes me so nervous.
sam...You're going to be great OK?
what am I supposed to say?
I can't tell them my Swedish pompom girl joke you know.
those are great. Where'd you get those?
nice, huh? Molly.
what do you think? Are they me?
man, look at that. A Testarossa.
whoa. Pay off your Mustang first.
how are you feeling? What did the doctor say?
he said it was contagious that it was really...
he said I shouldn't be coming in today.
what about the rash? The rash?
Mmhmm. The rash is also incredibly contagious.
he said they've both been spreading. No.
on your genitals again?
Yeah. Yeah, right on the genitals.
basically everywhere. He said that I shouldn't touch anyone.
excuse me. I'm sorry.
you're sick. I know.
morning, Paul. Morning, Carl, Sam.
morning, Mr. Wheat.
morning, Susan. You're looking good.
Sam? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
here it is.
Thanks.
morning, Sam. Morning. Listen the Kobiashi people. They're already here.
they're early. I know.
come here.
Andy Dillon called
how long have they been. About 10 minutes.
Andy Dillon called and says he needs $900,000 transferred to Albany by 10:00.
by 10: 00? Yes.
Carl?
bill, hold on
Dillon needs 900,000 in Albany by 10:00.
can you transfer it to his payroll account?
OK. I'll need your Mac code.
discretion, right?
got it. You bet. I'll do it right now. Thanks
bill, I'll call you back.
OK. OK. That's fine. That's fine. That's fine!
Aw, man. It's too far out.
can you get this, man?
where are you guys from. The New York City Ballet?
almost.
saved your life!
you shit. You scared me to death.
why'd you do that?
it's better than seeing this gorgeous body splattered all over the place.
look out.
Sam? Molly? You guys home?
did you invite Carl?
slave labor.
Carl? What?
hurry. Help. My God.
grab the bottom.
want this down here?
right here?
watch your toes.
where do you want this? Uh, in the bedroom.
God, this place looks great.
Yeah. You like it, huh?
like is hardly the word.
I didn't know it would be this beautiful.
Molly, what about her?
leave her there until we get the rest in.
what are these?
let me show you.
help me lift this up. Here?
Wow. What do you think?
it's fantastic. I love it.
Sam, what's this chair doing here?
what do you mean? I love that chair.
I know but we discussed this...
I've had it forever.
when I watch TV, I sit in it.
this chair is ugly.
so? And it doesn't go with anything.
it goes with me.
you're right. It does.
we'll paint it. We'll what?
are you OK? Mmhmm. I'm fine.
what's the matter? Nothing.
you worried about the promotion? No, not really.
then what? Is it moving in together? No.
I don't know. It's...a lot of things.
I just don't want the bubble to burst.
seems like, uh...
whenever anything good in my life happens
I'm just afraid I'm going to lose it.
I love you.
I really love you.
ditto.
the pilot first reported trouble when the number two engine blew
Jesus, another one?
don't watch that.
I should cancel my L.A. trip. These things always happen in threes.
Sam, get serious. Besides you lead a charmed life.
yeah? So did they.
it's amazing.
just like that. Blackout.
what are you doing?
I couldn't sleep.
I must have passed out.
what time is it? It's 2 a.m..
no. I hope it wasn't a masterpiece.
it's not now.
can I help? Yeah.
put your hands here and get them wet.
just let the clay slide between your fingers.
no.
what's the matter?
a glitch. What's up?
the Greenberg and White accounts I can't get in.
the Mac code isn't working.
I changed it. Why?
nothing. I want to nose around a bit.
is something wrong?
can you keep a secret?
Yeah, sure. What's up?
there's too much money in these accounts.
too much money? That's impossible.
Sam, this is going to take you hours. Let me do this.
it's already taken me hours.
let me figure it out.
no, that's OK. It's like a vendetta now.
thanks though. I appreciate it.
OK. If you start to go blind give a shout.
OK. Adios.
listen, what are you and Moll doing tonight?
we're going to the theater to see Macbeth.
she likes the guys in tights.
you want to go?
no, thanks. I want a full report though.
later. Yeah.
well, I loved it. I was spellbound the whole time.
I could tell. So could everyone else with that resonating snore of yours.
did I tell you what Melissa said?
Yeah, about six times.
it wasn't six times.
quit being so blase about this.
this is really important.
I'll have two pieces in her gallery.
the New York Times reviews her gallery all the time.
Molly,The New York Times is just some frustrated little critic with pimples on his ass who flunked art school.
who cares what they think?
about eight million readers that's who.
Nah, they're just reading the sports page.
your work is really beautiful. It really is.
Thanks. It shouldn't matter what anyone else thinks just what I think.
I want to marry you, Sam. What?
what? Yep.
I've been thinking about it.
I've been thinking about it a lot and I think we should just do it.
you're serious. Yeah.
what's that look for?
you never wanted to talk about it.
do you love me, Sam?
well, what do you think?
why don't you ever say it?
what do you mean? I say it all the time.
no, you say "ditto" and that's not the same.
people say I love you all the time and it doesn't mean anything.
you know sometimes you need to hear it.
I need to hear it.
let's go.
what should we do? Let me handle it.
what do you want?
your wallet give it to me!
Sam, just give it to him.
OK, just take the money. Just leave
no, Sam
you son of a bitch!
Sam, don't!
somebody help us!
somebody! Somebody help us!
Sam, just let...
Sam, stop it. Stop it, Sam!
Molly?
Molly, he got
Sam...
baby, hold on. You're going to be OK.
somebody? Somebody?
somebody help us!
my God, Sam. Come on. Hold on, baby.
someone's going to come.
you're going to be OK.
somebody! Somebody help me!
please, anybody!
help me. Please help me.
take it easy, all right?
we'll help you, OK?
Molly? Molly?
all right. All right.
what should we do?
what's happening?
what's...
is he breathing?
I don't know if he's breathing.
don't die, Sam. Hold on.
come on, man.
all right.
here we go.
come on, baby.
Sam, don't you leave me. Sam, hold on!
Sam...
Jesus...
miss Jensen, if you'll just step this way, please.
so, what happened to you? What?
you're new, huh? I could tell.
are you talking to me?
relax. It ain't like before. It's a whole new ball of wax.
who are you?
I'm waiting for my wife. She's in the cardiac wing. She's fighting it.
shot, huh?
that'll do it every time.
poor bastard.
you may as well get used to it.
you could be here for a long while.
come here. I'll tell you a secret.
doors ain't so bad.
zip zap they ain't nothing. You'll see. You'll catch on.
he ain't going to make it.
I've seen it a million times. He's a goner.
you see? Here they come.
lucky bastard. It could have been the other ones. You never know.
who are
No!
God help me.
God...help me.
I am sunk in the abysmal swamp where there is no foothold.
I have reached the watery depths. The flood overwhelms me.
I am wearied with calling.
as we say farewell to our friend Sam Wheat we are reminded of his kindness...his generosity his buoyancy of spirit.
all that we treasure our loved ones our friends our body our mind are but on loan to us. We must surrender them all.
we are all travelers on the same road which leads to the same end.
as our loved one enters eternal life let us remember that love too is eternal.
that although we will miss him our love will light the void and dispel the darkness.
I picked up your shirts today. I don't know why.
Mr. Reynolds told me to tell you hello.
I broke into tears.
it's like I think about you every minute.
it's like I can still feel you.
I'm here, Moll.
Floyd, what's the matter, kitty?
crazy cat.
Sam?
that's really stupid.
I love this picture.
it's great. Office.
let me see that.
it's, um... Sam's address book. Right.
Dave Brubeck. Newport '88. Should I toss them?
no. No? Molly, we hated that concert.
you wanted to save those?
Rolaids? Molly, what are you doing?
I just miss him, Carl.
me, too.
Carl? Yeah?
wait a minute. Wait.
what? Not that one.
which? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put that on there. That's OK.
Hey, Moll, why don't you come?
it's like summer outside.
no, I'm really not up for it.
just for a walk.
I don't want to.
you can't stay in all day.
it's not healthy.
Carl, I can't do it!
Molly, you're not the one who died.
I'm sorry. Don't apologize.
shit.
maybe you're right. Maybe just a short one. That a girl.
I'm sorry. Don't worry about it.
Molly!
what are you doing here?
you bastard.
you son of a bitch!
what do you want?
Molly? Molly, get out!
my God.
no, Molly! Look, no, no, please!
Molly! Molly, he's got a gun!
Hi, kitty. Hi.
you hurt her
shit!
is somebody there? Hello?
Hello?
my God!
let go! What are you doing?
like trains?
stay out! This is mine!
shit.
it's me. I couldn't get it. She came home.
give me a couple of days, man. I'll go back.
relax. I'll get it.
get what?
who are you? What do you want from us?
no. You stay away from her.
do you hear me? Stay away from her!
Rosa Santiago?
please be seated.
our sister will be with us soon.
sister Oda Mae grant us the gift of your all seeing presence.
appear before us now.
Mrs. Santiago?
buenos dias.
I'm Oda Mae Brown.
I understand you wish to contact your husband.
I believe he'll be with us today. Thank you.
but you know Mrs. Santiago, there's no telling about that other world so you've got to be a believer. Mrs. Santiago. Are you a believer?
Si. Si. I believe. I believe.
then let us begin.
I can't. I can't. It's too difficult.
I can't make contact. I don't feel his
no, wait!
I'm feeling something. Did he know someone by the name of Anna?

Sam Wheat!
Jesus.
Sam Wheat? Sam Wheat?
I swear no more cheating.
I'll do anything. I'll do penance but make that guy go away!
no way.
it's OK.
Yeah, you're all right.
my mother and my mother's mother both had the gift.
they always said I had it but I never did. I never had it.
they told me all about it.
but now that I got it I don't think I want it.
go away. Find somebody else.
somebody else? You're out of your mind.
I'm getting there fast.
she hit her head harder than we think.
she was talking to nobody before she hit her head.
sister can do that.
where exactly are you?
standing right beside you.
you're standing right beside me?
well, honey. We're right here.
are you white? What?
white?
you're white, aren't you?
know what I think? I'll call the doctor right now.
I knew it. A white guy. Why me?
listen, damn it. You're going to help me.
there's a woman named Molly Jensen. She's in terrible danger.
the man who killed me broke into our apartment and he's going to go back.
you've got to warn her.
what makes you think she'll listen to me?
it's just a phone call.
look...
you're all I've got.
now, I'm not leaving until you help me.
I don't care how long it takes 'cause I can talk forever.
Hello? Uh, hi. Is this Molly Jensen?
Yes. My name's Oda Mae Brown. I'm a spiritual reader and advisor.
a friend of yours gave me a message for you.
I know this sounds crazy but it's not. You got to believe me.
just don't be afraid.
who is this?
I got a message from Sam.
what?
Sam Wheat? He asked me to call.
I told you.
go there.
forget it. I'm not going anywhere. I don't care what you do.
second verse. Same as the first
second verse. Same as the first
all right! All right! Stop singing! I'll go anywhere you want to just don't sing anymore.
I can't believe this. I can't believe I'm doing this.
what am I doing down here? I never come downtown. I hate downtown.
she's probably not even there.
where are you?
which building is it?
uh, push 3.
see? Nobody's there. She's there. Just wait.
I did everything I said I'd do.
I pressed the button.
she's not there. I'm going.
take one down. Pass it around. Don't sing all right?
Shh! She can't hear you.
Hi, I'm Oda Mae. I called you about your friend Sam Wheat?
I told you.
Molly! Molly Jensen. I know you're up there. I know you hear me.
I'm down here. Sam wants to talk to you. This is for real.
remember the starfish in Montego Bay?
how would I know that if he wasn't here?
Hey, Molly. I know about the green underwear that you wrote your name on.
I'd never get over that I tell you that.
I know about the picture in Reno.
ask her about the sweater she knitted in the closet that's too big.
he asked me to remind you of the sweater in the closet that you knitted that's too big.
four sizes.
hey you hear me talking to you?
I hear you. Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.
ever hear of a phone? Want to kiss my butt?
I'm not staying down here all day. Thank God.
Aw, man, shut up.
Molly!
I'm going to count to 3 and I'm out of here.
1, 2, 3.
no. Oda, wait. No.
it's Molly.
Molly?
I'm Oda Mae Brown.
I don't know you or Sam but let me tell you what he did.
he kept me up all night singing I'm Henry The Eighth I Am.
that's how he got me to go out with him.
look, I'm sorry. I just I just don't believe in this life after death stuff.
well, tell her she's wrong.
he says you're wrong.
you're talking to him right now?
he just asked me to tell you that you're wrong.
so where is he?
I can't see him. I can only hear him.
I'm right here.
that doesn't help, Sam.
I'm holding her hand.
he says he's holding your hand.
what are you doing? What do you think you're doing to me?
if you think I'm here for my health you're crazy.
Sam's dead, OK? He's dead.
tell her I love her.
he says he loves you.
Sam would never say that.
say ditto.
what the hell is ditto? Ditto!
to tell you the truth I don't know how I'm doing this.
confidentially, nothing like this has ever happened to me before.
I mean nothing. Now I can't turn it off.
is this him? Is this you?
Yeah. Yeah.
huh. Cute. White but cute.
what I don't understand is why did he come back?
I don't know.
why is he still here?
he's stuck that's what it is. He's in between worlds.
you know it happens sometimes that the spirit gets yanked out so quick that the essence still feels it has work to do.
would you stop rambling?
I'm just answering her question.
he's got an attitude now.
I don't have an attitude. Yes, you do have an attitude.
we're having a little discussion.
if you didn't have a attitude you wouldn't have raised your voice.
God damn it. Oda Mae
don't you god damn me. Don't you take the Lord's name in vain.
would you relax? You relax. You're the dead guy.
want me to help? You apologize.
Jesus Christ! I'm leaving.
nobody talks to me like that you understand?
now you better apologize.
I'm sorry. I apologize. OK?
now would you sit down? Please?
he's apologized.
I need you to tell Molly what I'm saying but you have to tell her word for word.
word for word. Yes.
he wants me to tell you what he's saying word for word.
Molly, you're in danger.
you can't just blurt it out like that.
and quit moving around, will you? You're making me dizzy.
I'll just tell her in my own way.
Molly, you in danger, girl.
what are you talking about?
I know the man who killed me.
he knows who killed him.
his name's Willy Lopez. I know where he lives.
he's a Puerto Rican Willy Lopez. He knows where he lives.
write it down.
you write it down. I ain't no damn secretary.
just do it!
he's so testy.
what is it you want me to write?
it's 303 Prospect Place apartment 4D.
303 Prospect Place? Yeah.
that's my neighborhood.
Molly, he's got my wallet he's got my key and he was in here.
he's got his wallet and key and was here.
yesterday after your walk with Carl you talked to Floyd took off your clothes
all right, all right.
when you came in after your walk with Carl he saw everything.
go to the police. It was a setup.
I was murdered.
he says go to the police. He was murdered.
there's somebody else involved
I don not know whom forget it...
I don't want no more to do with this.
wait where are you go? What do you mean where am I go? I'm leaving
I did everything I said I'd do. And don't be following me.
I'm finished. I mean it.
a nice life. Have a nice death. Goodbye.
Molly, there is no one on earth besides you who wants this to be true more than me but you got to be rational about this.
Sam is no more in this room than
look, I understand the need to hang on to him I really do but this is absurd.
I know this seems absurd but it had to be real.
you believed some fortuneteller from Brooklyn who shows up at your door?
I watched her have a conversation with him.
I don't buy it. Moll, not for a minute.
what about the things she knew?
what things?
the photo Sam took of me on our trip to Reno.
Carl, we were alone.
and the green underwear that I wrote my name in.
she said Sam knew who killed him.
Yeah, that he was set up.
this is getting deranged. We're off the deep end.
she had a name and an address
Willy Lopez.
303 Prospect Place apartment 4D.
this is sick.
Carl.
this is really sick.
God.
Molly, I don't understand how you could you could...
swallow this crap. I mean...this guy may not even exist.
maybe she's just trying to use you to set someone up.
you're right.
you're absolutely right.
that's what I got to find out.
what do you mean find out?
she said Sam wants me to go to the police.
Sam wants you to go to the police?
Jesus. Moll. Are you out of your mind?
what are you going to tell the police?
that some storefront psychic has been communing with the dead?
do you know what that sounds like?
you're talking ghosts here for Christ's sake.
I'm sorry. This stuff just really gets to me you know? It's OK if you don't believe me.
I'm trying to, Molly.
if it'll make you feel any better I'll go check this out, OK?
I want you to try and get some sleep.
all right.
I'll call you in the morning. OK.
good night
be careful.
Carl.
what the hell are you doing here?
who you been talking to, Willy?
talking to? What the hell do you mean?
some woman knows all about you everything.
Where's she getting it from?
I haven't said a word to anybody.
she knows your name and where you live.
a lot of women know where I live.
this is not a joke.
she knows about the murder.
I want you to find this bitch whoever she is and I want you to just get rid of her, OK?
I've got $4 million stuck in a god damn computer.
if I don't get those codes if that money is not transferred soon...
I'm...dead. We're both dead.
why not tell them you only launder money the first of the month?
what the hell is wrong with you? Is everything a joke?
you killed a man. You were supposed to steal his wallet.
was that a joke? I did you a favor. That was a freebie.
look, these are drug dealers, OK?
just don't blow this for me. I've risked my job. I could go to jail.
$80,000 of that money is mine.
look, just...let me have the key to Sam's apartment.
I'll get the address book myself, OK?
you god damn bastard!
Why? Why? You were my friend!
I had a life god damn you. I had a life!
look, I don't even believe in this stuff myself.
but she was real.
you think I'd come down here if it wasn't real?
you know you told me if I had any new information that I should come. So here I am.
I know how this sounds.
I hear myself saying it and I want to cringe.
but this woman knew things she couldn't have known.
things Sam only said to me.
OK, according to this psychic lady there are ghosts and spirits all over the place watching us all the time? Huh?
hell, I'm never going to get undressed again.
excuse me. I got more important things to do.
the guy's name is Willy Lopez.
all I'm asking you to do is check it out.
OK. Wait here. Let me see if the guy's got a record, all right?
great.
what are you doing?
Where's the file on Willy Lopez? There isn't one.
he was probably some old boyfriend she was trying to get even with.
this psychic woman's got a record that goes back a long way.
1967 Shreveport forgery...
selling false I.D. served one year 1971
Baton Rouge arrested for fraud.
numbers racketeering served 10 months 1974.
look, this is impossible.
it goes on and on
she knew things, private things.
now how could she have known all that?
a lot of times they read the obits.
she just had to see the word "banker" boom.
hell, they even go through your...garbage to find things they can use letters old papers. It doesn't take much.
no. It was real.
she knew about a...a sweater I knitted.
and songs we sang. Our trip to Montego Bay.
I'm sorry. I know this is hard.
people want so much to believe.
they're grieving they're vulnerable...
and they will give anything for one last moment.
believe me. These people know what they're doing.
I know how you must feel but you know you can press charges.
no.
thank you.
God, let this be it.
Yes.
hello. Eddie? It's Carl Bruner.
what's up?
everything's fine. Just we're all set.
let me know what you want me to do.
want you to transfer the money from the 12 separate accounts into a single account under the name Rita Miller.
OK.
tomorrow at five minutes before closing 3: 55 p. m.
transfer the full account to the First Island Bank of Nassau registry number 4869580.
call us when it's done.
OK. I've got it.
just tell Mr. Balistrari that there won't be any more problems OK?
Yeah. I'll do that. Thank you.
good work, Carl.
Molly, why can't you hear me? I need you.
who is it? It's Carl, Molly.
no. Don't open it , Molly. He's a murderer.
Hi. I know it's late. I'm sorry to disturb you.
I've been thinking about you all day and I feel really lousy about what happened last night.
this supernatural thing just
don't worry about it. It's OK. No, it's not.
you needed me to hear you and I didn't.
I wasn't there for you and that was...that was wrong.
it's just I...
I just want you to know that I'm your friend.
Thanks, Carl.
you were never our friend.
that really means a lot to me. Me, too.
I brought you some Japanese apple pears. I know you like them.
Thanks. That's very sweet.
could I come in for a second?
it's just been one of those days.
maybe some coffee?
Yeah. Come on in.
no, Molly.
you seem a little tense. Are you OK?
no. I'm fine. It's just what can I tell you?
it's been tough. It just still hurts so much.
you lying snake.
and on top of it, it's stuff at work.
they've given me my own accounts which is good but I just haven't really had time to adjust kind of absorb everything.
it's no big deal.
Yeah. Can I have just a little more cream?
shit. Jesus. I can't believe I did that.
are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
let me throw that in the washer.
don't worry about it. It's OK. It's just...
you want another shirt? No. It'll dry. It'll just take a minute.
where were you today? I thought you were going to come into the bank and sign those papers?
I was supposed to but I didn't have time.
I went to the police.
you did? Wow. What did you tell them?
what did they say? It was awful.
I felt really stupid.
they brought out a file on this woman and
at least 10 inches thick.
a rip off artist, huh?
no, Molly.
you know the sad thing...is that I believed her.
Molly...
sometimes we need to believe.
Why? What's the point?
Molly, it's not easy to face the realities of life sometimes.
you got to give yourself that.
what you've got to remember is the love that you guys felt.
you got to remember how good Sam was.
you were everything to him Molly. You were his life.
I feel so alone.
you're not alone. OK?
you got your work. You're incredibly talented. You're young.
you're fantastically gorgeous.
I don't know what's real anymore.
I don't know what to think.
just think about Sam.
think about the time you guys had together.
how wonderful that was.
Yeah. Let your feelings out, Moll. It's OK.
life turns on a dime. You know?
I mean...people think that...
they're there forever that there's always going to be tomorrow but that's bull shit. Sam taught us that.
you have to live for now.
for today.
I can't. I'm sorry. It's OK.
I, I, I can't. It's just too soon. It's OK.
you've been great, Carl.
but I need you to leave. I understand totally.
please.
could we just have dinner tomorrow night? Just talk?
can I interest you in that?
Yeah. Sure. Great.
get off my train! No.
get off!
get off! Get off!
get off! Get out of here!
no. Show me how you do that. I'm not leaving till you teach me.
get off! No.
get off!
you stubborn asshole.
what are you doing? What the hell are you doing?
what am I doing?
you're trying to move it with your finger.
you can't push it. You're dead.
it's all in your mind.
the problem with you is you still think you're real.
you think you're wearing those clothes?
you think you're crouched on that floor?
bull shit!
you ain't got a body no more, son!
it's all up here! You want to move something you got to move it with your mind!
you got to focus! Do you understand?
how? How do you focus?
I don't know how you focus. You just focus.
how did you do that?
you got to take all your emotions all your anger all your love all your hate and push it way down into the pit of your stomach and let it explode like a reactor. Pow!
OK. OK.
don't laugh.
way to go, kid.
I did it. I did it.
way to go.
from your gut like I told you.
give it time. What else have you got?
how long have you been here?
since they pushed me.
someone pushed you? Yeah, someone pushed me.
who? You don't believe me?
you think I fell? You think I jumped? Fuck you!
it wasn't my time! I wasn't supposed to go!
I'm not supposed to be here!
I'd give anything for a drag.
just one drag.
are you all right?
who are you? Why are you hounding me?
who sent you?
who sent you?
leave me alone.
leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Yes! You need to concentrate 'cause if you concentrate you'll probably rouse him.
what's his name again? Orlando.
Orlando. Orlando. Is there an Orlando here?
I'm here.
he's here. Sam.
Oda Mae. Excuse me. I'm Orlando. The line's over there.
where did these ghosts come from?
you can hear them, too?
I hear them in the morning and the evening.
they're coming into the shower.
did you tell every spook you met about me?
I got spooks from Jersey coming in here.
there's stuff going on you wouldn't believe.
it's amazing. You're really doing it. I know.
can you hurry this up?
chill out. Chill out.
I need your help. There's something we need to do.
I'm not doing anything else with you, Sam.
you're holding on to a life that doesn't want you anymore.
it doesn't want you. Give up the ghost.
are you speaking to me?
does it look like it?
you're supposed to be concentrating, aren't you?
you going to try it?
thank you very much.
Sam, are you going to get out of here?
fine, then stay there.
excuse me. Excuse me. You ready now?
let's do it.
I got to talk to you now. I've got a plan.
all we got to do is we can...
Oda Mae?
Oda Mae.

orlando, you like it? It's autumn sunrise.
get out of me, you son of a bitch.
don't you ever do that to me again.
Orlando?
I can barely move.

what happened to Orlando? Where's the insurance policy?
are you deaf? I said everybody out!
everybody out! Get out! Get out!
get out. Everybody get out!

Willy.
Willy?

Oda Mae! Sister! Sister!
I'm all right. I'm all right.
we're in trouble so you got to help.
what do you mean we? You're already dead.
these people are trying to kill me.
and they'll be back.
why don't you just find a house to haunt?
get some chains and rattle them or something.
I have a plan and it will work but get some of your fake I.D.s.
forget it.
if you do this, they'll never bother you again.
Scout's honor.
all right. What do I have to do? What exactly do I have to do?
you got a nice dress?
I don't see what's wrong with what I'm wearing.
sorry. I made a joke. I love your shoes.
I don't know anything about banking.
Oda Mae, would you just relax?
listen, I'm nervous.
I'll get you through it.
your fake driver's license is great.
Sam. I don't think I should do this.

no. No. Endorse it.
if I endorse it then if I drop it somebody will get it.
I never said you were going to get the money.
it's blood money. I was killed for this money.
now endorse the check.
what are you going to do with it?
look over there. To your left.
you don't think I'm giving this $4 million
if you don't they'll track you down.
to a bunch of nuns. Get rid of it.
Sam, you're killing me! It's $4 million!
you'll go to heaven.
I don't want to go to heaven. I want to cash the check.
hello.
you'll thank me later.
how are you doing?
now, endorse it "Rita Miller." I know.
make it out to St. Joseph's shelter.
I can't believe you're making me do this.
now give it to her.
I want to feel it one more time.
give the lady the check. I will!
hand her the check. You can do it.
give her the check. I will!
bless you child. Bless you.
give it to her.
let go. Let go!

I'm proud of you, Oda Mae.
I don't care. Stay away from me from now on.

I thought we were having dinner.
I know, Moll. I'm sorry. I just forgot.
had trouble at the bank.
forgot? I wish you'd called. I've been really worried.
listen, Molly. I got to ask you about something.
Yeah. He needs to borrow $4 million.
when you said that you thought Sam was here that he was talking to you what did he say to you?
what does that have to do with anything?
just listen to me.
this psychic lady, I want to know what she told you.
stop this.
it doesn't matter. It wasn't real.
what the hell happened to you tonight?
does this have anything to do with her being at the bank today?
the bank? Yeah. Ferguson said she closed an account.
her name isn't even Oda Mae Brown. It's Rita Miller or something.
Carl, are you all right?
it's just my stomach. It's...
Jesus.
do you have any like some Pepto Bismol or something? Cyanide...
Yeah. It's upstairs. Sit down. I'll get it.
what's wrong? Does little Carl have a tummy ache?
what are you doing?
now do you believe in ghosts?
I'll set the place on fire I swear to God.
I'll cut her throat.
Carl.
I swear to God. I'll cut her throat.
I need that money and I want it tonight at 11:00.
if that psychic does not bring it here Molly is dead. OK?
Carl, who are you talking to?
nothing. Now, Molly, listen to me.
I can't explain this now but there's a problem OK?
something at the bank.
Carl, you're scaring me. I'm sorry.
I'll come back about 11:00.
Why? Why not now? Molly look I'll come back.
like 11:00, OK?
Molly, but it's important. Got to go.

I've always loved you.
ditto.
it's amazing, Molly.
the love inside...you take it with you.

my name is Lee Siusheung
when I was a child, I loved watching cartoons
every time when Ultraman appeared, I would be super excited
it was he who told me there was justice in this world
justice badge?
don't move, mind the pin
OK, there
however, after I was 8
I have never watched cartoons again
I don't believe in anything now
I only believe in my own fists
take out all your money quickly, you stupid
what a waste of time
you call it a 9-section iron chain just by joining some iron pellets?
why don't you chop off your fingers to make a 1 0-section iron chain?
come on,
I am not afraid of pain
you really believe you are the Captain of Earth Guard
Siu Sheung is the Captain
what?
I said Siu Sheung is the Captain, dude
to hell with Siu Sheung
today I delivered goods to Block 8
and bumped into 5 bastards from So Uk Estate 1 0 feet trod on my head
is your head that big?
not only that they even pinched my finger with a knife
but I knew I had to keep calm at that moment
I said to myself
thunder!
you are bullying me like this
you will have to pay for it!
and then I was so smart
I pretended to be scared, I yelled
kid, no need to be afraid
in fact that...
...was a signal
upon receiving my order, Siu Sheung rushed to the scene
the Captain of Earth Guard eventually turned out
I and Siu Sheung exchanged knowing glances
he told me
earth Guard cannot do without me at that moment, I was somewhat touched
then I retreated in order to advance, so as to coordinate with Siu Sheung
at last, the 2 of us defeated the 5 master-hands
Siu Sheung, you are marvellous!
sorry, sorry
I am destined to be in the company of righteous friends so I don't mind saying this once more
if you don't join Siu Sheung's and my Earth Guard,
I don't care
but the loss is ultimately yours
take your shower and shut up
sir, I hope your hands won't shake
they started the fight first
it doesn't matter that I go to the police station with you
put down your gun first
get on the van
how many times have you done this?
the damn cops started it first
of course I had to fight back
I won't bail you out again next time
Hey, don't be like that
I will treat you to chicken in glutinous rice
to hell with your chicken in glutinous rice
chasing the bad guys and the devils
we all dream big
I want the world to be peaceful and all evils be overcome
the army, navy and airforce launch a joint attack
the army, navy and airforce launch a joint attack
hurry up, the big combination!
Hey, didn't you say you would buy parts to fix the fan?
mommy, come on out quick! The big combination!
the big combination!
coming, coming!
I have to go fry the vegetables
dinner will be served soon
let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go!
God Sigma is waiting for you
I am coming!
daddy!
daddy
do you reckon Ultraman can defeat the 3-head monster?
it is indeed risky
it all depends on whether his hand can be combined
if so, that would be OK
if not, he may lose
then won't the earth be in great danger?
even our estate will be in trouble
you don't have to worry
our estate has always been guarded by Ultraman
Really? Who?
me
you are not even as good as Mommy
even Ultraman would occasionally lose to monsters
that's too bad
Siu Sheung, it's time to go home for dinner
it's time, let's go
daddy, that's the Ultraman sword I want
it's Mommy's birthday
daddy has to buy birthday present for Mommy
Ultraman sword...next month next month we will buy Ultraman sword
justice badge?
you have been yearning for it, right?
give it to me
be careful, mind the pin
good, let's put it here
stand against Ultraman
daddy!
daddy...
daddy...
brother Lone, trust me, Brother Lone
though I am not as good at fighting as Siu Sheung or the Masked Rider
I can still 400% protect you, Brother Lone
brother Lone, why are you laughing? Brother Lone
you are so educated, yet all you know is laughing?
brother Lone, how come you never trust me?
Wow! Siu Sheung, why are you sitting so high up there?
Siu Sheung, don't you know that...
...you return at the right time
come back to Earth Guard it's a bit exhausting that I am the only guard
too little good guy, too many bad guy
I have a dream!
after deep deliberation
I have painstakingly written this proposal for Earth Guard
I have reserved a place for you
take a look
save vulnerable groups, combat estate bullies and rascals
Hey, don't turn the page
Hey, take a look
the 1 0 Aims and 5 Principles of Earth Guard
I have also drawn all the patrol routes and have even designed the uniform
but don't you think...
it's a bit too sexy?
how much is the patrol charge?
and protection fee? How much?
what if we got injured?
killed in action?
who will take care of our family?
I have no family
but you are right
with family, you have to be more considerate
so this is crap
don't deny yourself so completely
you just let me deny myself completely for once
a man-to-man fight 2 iced milk teas
we are closed
I am in a big rush
what? For here or to go?
you two are just practising
how much are the broken glasses? I will compensate
money doesn't always talk $1 0, 000 each $50, 000
50000
you have exceptional skill, don't waste it
our group always welcomes talents
come if you are interested.
matsumoto Group Yim Tai Muk
mom
you're home? Yes
the boss says these super spicy noodles are left over and they cannot be kept overnight
no discount for mild spicy noodle, but super spicy ones are $3 cheaper
only $3
are you really that short of cash?
do you want to poison your mom with spice?
no
you have been worrying about the route change fee
saving $3 dollars means $3 saved
the route change fee is $30, 000
do you really think it's $3?
don't even think about it if you don't have $30, 000
here is $50, 000.
spend the remainder on gas
did you rob?
I have told you I can make money by fighting
are you engaged in underground boxing?
I am now the head of security
have I not been a security guard?
if it pays so well I don't have to drive a minibus
matsumoto Group
I have to wear a suit for work
Hey, where is daddy's suit?
I have to wear it tomorrow
is this your daddy's suit?
Yes, it's my daddy's
not many people can wear this nowadays
take it off
I don't want it torn during fighting
there is a glass of water, don't let anyone touch it
it's a good fight
but you couldn't protect the glass of water
then are you hiring me or not?
can you report for duty at 9am tomorrow?
sure!
miss, if those in your bag are counted, the total is $48. 5
Oh, you are so smart at calculating?
did you spy on me?
take them out or I will regard it as shoplifting
please include this pack of sanitary napkin
the total is $80. 5, including this
I will handle it, you go first
sir, short by 50 cents
sir
I don't need that pack, refund me
Mr. Hon
I have ordered congee with pork and preserved small fish
good
do you want to add a dish of vegetable?
yes
new colleague?
good morningï¼Come eat
fresh plain congee
plain congee again?
I can't survive without meat
let me introduce our new colleague
Wah Chiu, Tak Bun
call me Siu Ho
there's still one that hasn't arrived yet. I will introduce him to you later
brother Chiu, Brother Tak Bun, Brother Siu Ho
you don't have to call me brother, just Siu Ho is fine
plain congee again!
freshly cooked!
how do you want us to call you?
my name is Lee Siusheung
brother Siusheung, would you like tea or water?
just call me Siusheung please
I asked you if you would like tea or water
tea
pour it yourself OK
uncle Lui Good morning
brother Tongï¼ Brother Wing, good morning
take a seat
when the congee arrives, people arrive
let me drink a cup of tea first, I am so thirsty
good, congee. Pork liver congee
I abstain from eating meat today, no congee for me
give it to Lui
help yourself, I love congee
such big bowls. Don't stop, don't stop
you will get sick if you don't eat anything
of course
you will be senior superintendent if you get another promotion
do you know why you get promoted so fast?
don't ask the PCs to work next time
they will only make a mess of it, you will be implicated sooner or later
hello
right, this is our new colleague
Siusheung, Ah Nam
Hello? Hello?
as a formality, I need to tell you
Mr. Hon comes here for morning dim sum everyday
wherever he goes, we go
never do anything that would disgrace him
then do we have to fight?
we are security guards, we ensure the safety of our boss
we do not fight
then why do you have a knife on you?
smoking time
what are you staring at? You junior security guard!
never fight with your colleagues again
if not, nobody will help you when you get into trouble
I don't hire you because you are a good fighter
don't think that you excel at fighting
if you do a good job, you can stay.
if not, I will fire you
there's no difference between hiring you or another
don't think that you are outstanding
put on your jacket, come out
how much were the stuffs that day?
your shoplifting skill was poor
is that old dude your boss?
none of your business
I have been with him since I was very young
go
behind
go
is the lady with you?
don't wander around, wait for my call
OK
good morning, miss
good morning
you are up
good morning
what are you all doing?
you don't have to feel sorry
smile, everyone!
smile!
daddy
daddy, why do you look so dumb?
have a bowl of pork congee
I want plain congee with an egg
yes
my daughter
daddy,
I am a big girl now
is that so?
you are so fond of playing in the band why don't you return to Taiwan and I'll get Wu Bai to produce an album for you
I want Jay Chou to produce it for me
daddy, actually I don't really need to play in a band
moreover, I don't want to return to Taiwan
it's so boring
Mr. Hon Yu those idiots didn't target me they targeted you
you have to find out who did it, chop chop
it is I who should worry about you, instead of you worrying about me
having studied abroad really makes a difference
I will ask Shing to get someone to protect you
don't!
with a bunch of followers like that, it is in fact most dangerous
I feel perfectly safe walking around all by myself
nobody knows I am your daughter
how about Tai Muk?
he's both uncouth and weird
eating congee with fried egg? You weirdo
let's do it this way
you deploy this new guy to protect me
he's younger, so it's less gross
he looks dumb
is he OK?
your bodyguards were genuinely dumb
he was the only one who could catch up with me
Oh, he could catch up with you
what's wrong? What's wrong?
nothing
as a man, you are really pathetic
don't drive so fast next time
I don't know how to drive slow
Siu Sheung!
Siu Sheung!
Siu Sheung...
my beloved brother!
let's practise a little first
I have been missing you ever since you reported for duty
new teammate?
a man-to-man fight
your friend?
Annie, this is Big Bird
a man-to-man fight
OK, no need for words
as long as you are a new teammate recommended by Siu Sheung you are definitely eminent
have a drumstick first
wow, awesome! Drumstick!
what a glutton
but it doesn't matter. As our teammate
I won't allow you to starve
a man-to-man fight
OK
I will come back after delivering the drumstick...
...to have a man-to-man fight with you
here is your drumstick Awesome!
Hey, what is this "new teammate" you talked about?
earth Guard
I am 002, Siusheung is 001
earth Guard?
you mean those in uniform who carry out special missions?
right! Right!
we even have our uniform designed
wow, stylish!
but we haven't designed a uniform for female teammate yet
Hey, it doesn't matter, I can wear male uniform
Hey, how much is the enrolment fee?
I only got $1 0, 000
$1 0, 000?
no need for that much
we only charge $29
we don't have change for such a big bill
Hey, you aren't serious, are you?
I am serious. We will protect the earth
Hey, what is my number?
since you are recommended by Siu Sheung,
I will reserve 007 for you
good! What is your unique skill?
unique skill?
sure I have one
laser gun?
female teammates pay more attention to details
it turns out that we lack a logo
stop talking for the moment. Stand still if you want to look good
Yes, 007
done
let me see
wow, damn stylish!
Siu Sheung, come join us
crazy!
you come here
Hey, my eyes hurt!
my turn, my turn
Hey, you move over a bit. You move over a bit
move over a bit. Move over a bit
lower your armï¼a bit Lower
Hey, your legs Your legs
stretch your legs a bit
like me Like him, like Siusheung
hurry up. Come on
I am 007

and who are you?
what!? I am the owner of this flat
auntie, auntie, how do you do?
my name is Annie, the boss of your son
boss?
so young and you are a boss?
it's OK
where is Siu Sheung?
taking a bath
mom, finished work?
Hey, it's your turn
sit down
you two have reached such a stage so quickly?
with those spots on her face, she's kind of ugly
she's the daughter of my boss
I know
if she were not the daughter of your boss
I would strongly object to your relationship
imagine, when you have a baby in the future what will his face look like?
who will be look like?
he will look like me
wow, dinner!
awesome!
wow, it's worth drinking to now
what?
Hey, dig in, dig in
dig in Good, come on
spicy hot pot! Can you eat this?
awesome! I am Taiwanese
what a coincidence! I am also Taiwanese
Really? Really!
what a coincidence
Hey, let's drink a beer to this happy coincidence
good idea. Siu Sheung, get us a beer
beer!
where did you get it?
Cheers! Cheers!
auntie, you are pretty
Really?
many people say so
how do you keep up such a youthful appearance?
what brand of cream do you use?
I've heard about this wonderful mask. Have you tried it out?
it whitens and reduces wrinkles
so dramatic?
he dashed onto the stage and tried to draw his pistol so I bashed him with my guitar
gunmen are reckless they would shoot indiscriminately
I was so smart
I bumped him off, and I jumped out trying to attract attention so more people would come rescue me
great, what a heroine
then what happened?
then...
the first person who rushed to rescue me was...
your son
Siusheung?
right, he loved saving people when he was a kid
his favourite cartoon was...
what Stigma?
what 3 loyal warriors?
Oh, God Sigma!
Yes, God Sigma!
it was my favourite cartoon when I was a kid she also liked watching God Sigma
the theme song was sung by Leslie Cheung
Leslie Cheung didn't sing it well
my Siu Sheung does a better job singing it
Really?
when he was a kid, his singing was famous in our neighbourhood
his late father loved listening to him sing
Really?
I have a karaoke version of the song
great! Take it out
wow, you are really something
I am not that good
God Sigma rules the universe
the 3 loyal warriors
with courage and passion he is like a righteous big child
flying in the starry sky he discharges mysterious missions
looking at the home star afar which is so bright and beautiful
chasing the bad guys and the devils
Hey, I rarely see you so late
where are your wife and daughter?
traveling in Thailand
what happened outside?
it's too bad that I am so busy, otherwise I would have gone with them
that chap didn't die, what do you think?
which chap?
I saw Wah Chiu trying to do it.
you didn't see him?
the boss will take care of it
hon Yu's success...
is attributable to our efforts 10 years already!
now he has a business empire
money laundered, he is the chairman of a listed company
what are we doing now?
head of security?
if we didn't block off bullets for him, he would have died 9 times
who else is in it?
you should ask me why I revolt against him
search your heart
haven't you thought of taking over his position?
I haven't
I were not you,
I have
if need be, I kill. We are brothers, so what?
where is Wah Chiu? Call him now
Shing, you have followed me for years this is the first time you don't answer my call
there is an internal fraud in the Security Department
I need two days to take care of it
security Department?
does that include you?
Shing was not involved
did you hear it?
your men said you were not involved
despite being so experienced, you don't know about your men's revolt
tell me if I should still trust you
brother Hon
if we were to revolt, you would have fallen long time again
that means you want to revolt
you can't even protect your wife and daughter
you'd better shut up
we built the "society" together
I don't understand why we are still your lackeys
because you are incapable
this world no longer needs "societies
I cleared your names for you
I made Matsumoto a listed company
I want to let you know what is meant by morality and justice
revolt? You all!
if we were to revolt, you won't be standing here
no matter what...
Shing, learn how to be a man in your next life!
Siusheung
don't you think it's dangerous for Ultraman to fight with the monsters?
should be
if his hand cannot be combined, it will be dangerous
what should we do then?
no need to fear there are other Ultramen in the world
Really? Where?
me!
Hey, you are speeding again, I will throw up
the boat has arrived, are we leaving?
no matter what, we will die
either we die separately or we die together
I don't know what you want. Leave when there is a chance
hon Yu will not let us off
you fought so hard for a way out then you refused to leave
now you are back, you have no more choice
you can only kill me, take over my position then wait to be killed
this is your fate
daddy!
run!
daddy!
do not ask me why
because you have never treated me as a brother
how are they?
your son only suffers minor injuries
the man sent in with your son is in more serious condition
I've got it
sorry
don't say sorry every time you see me
it's not your fault
I am really sorry
don't claim responsibility for everything
if it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen
I did harm to you and your son
don't say that
you have never let go for so many years
I am all right
my husband and my son are the same
they would sacrifice their lives for justice
whatever.
I'd like to thank your son for saving Siusheung
please ask him not to protect Siusheung anymore
he spends his whole life protecting another person
that is not necessary
my son is no longer the old Lee Siu Sheung
it is he who decided to do that
he knew what happened to you and your son so he decided to protect Siusheung
because he thinks that is...
...the most basic duty of a policeman
mom...
mom...
you have woken up
go home if you are sleepy
are you hungry?
I...
I will never do it again
it's OK
sorry
don't cry
Really?
it's really OK
silly boy, don't cry
mom
have you seen Annie?
don't worry, she is safe
I brought the papers for you to sign. It's your father's last will
I want to sell them all
but, madam, that's gonna take a minimum of 2 weeks
no, I need it right now
what is Matsumoto Group?
who does Hon Yu think he is?
you have to help him
you scum.
you scum.
don't go!
it's none of your business
you think too highly of yourself.
this is your Achilles' heel
don't think of revenge
Shing is not someone you can handle
your father was a coward
I am not
if you don't forgive him, I can't do anything
but I have saved you, that makes you my friend
I don't need a friend like you
get lost!
do you want to lose your life?
you have already lost one hand. You can never defeat him
losing one hand is my own business
my life is mine, it's none of your business
your life is not yours alone
you can't even defeat me
if you just go out like that, how is it different from suicide?
when I was a kid, I thought you were superb
you had courage, passion...
and a sense of justice
you said you would beat the bad guys up
look at you, what a trash!
even my Daddy was cheated by you
don't you know you have fooled many people?
rubbish!
it's fine that you are like this
you will be sent to the landfill
you are better off than me
I am sitting here everyday doing nothing
you cannot be a hero anyway
let me give you a hand, so that you won't implicate other people
if you were Lee Siusheung will you forgive your father?
if I were Lee Siusheung
I will definitely not forgive a man...
...who turns a blind eye to my father's death
daddy
I have always respected you
I know you are a righteous man
since I was a child,
I have been able to tell people proudly...
...that my father is But Ching Mo
he is a good cop
I have learned something from Siu Sheung
if you think it is right persist in it till the end
what do you want?
I come to find out what you want
I really want to...
...help the world...
...create a new order
who do you think you are?
I have chips,
I can do whatever I want
you have no chips
you are not qualified to talk to me
uncle Choi
will you come to help Siu Sheung retaliate?
retaliate against whom so late at night?
to beat up the bad guys of South Group
are you nuts?
how dare you beat up the South Group guys?
I am not that stupid
Shing, come out!
you come out, Shing!
so you are Shing.
you look so gross
I am the Vice Captain of Earth Guard
you come out and let's have a man-to-man fight
are you afraid? A man-to-man fight!
what captain are you?
my name is Big Bird, the Vice Captain of Earth Guard
Siu Sheung is the Captain
I come here today to seek justice for Siu Sheung!
is the cripple not dead yet?
what are you talking about?
he is completely fine, just has a little flu
cut the crap.
let's have a man-to-man fight!
let him in
I am not afraid of you
although I personally can fight 10 people since you and I are on the same level
I now give you a chance to fight me one-on-one
that's really something
so I am forced to use my unique skill
the invincible...
triple rod!
come again!
Shing, finish fighting before you leave!
boss, do you have spicy hot noodle?
you two finish retaliation so fast?
come again!
come again! You have not won...
...as long as I am not dead
Shing, stop!
stop! Don't!
don't, Brother Shing!
don't! Let my friend off
No!
No!
big Bird!
no, Brother Shing!
I beg you
brother Shing, please don't!
I kowtow to you
sorry So you want to retaliate against me?
I won't retaliate, I won't retaliate
big Bird! Big Bird!
brother Shing, sorry
take the trash away
big Bird, let's go
you have to lick the ground clean first
if you want to be a hero, you should not have friends
big Bird, it's OK now
big Bird, we have arrived
big Bird...
Siu Sheung, I have brought you a big drumstick
look, I asked Uncle Choi to add more condiments
it's delicious
Hey, no need to worry
you just nurse your injuries here
I and my buddies will take care of your mom and Annie
your injuries are just minor
enough!
don't you know you are disgusting
get lost!
don't ever bother me again!
go!
no matter what,
earth Guard can't do without you
you will forever be the Captain in my heart
Hello, Professor? This is Annie
I need your help, as soon as possible ...you return at the right time
come back to Earth Guard it's a bit exhausting that I am the only guard
too little good guy too many bad guy
do you really believe there are Ultramen in this world?
Hey, don't belittle yourself
Ultramen are everywhere
big Bird's birthday party 7pm tonight, Rhododendron Restaurant
dear neighbours, Big Bird had a wish before his death which was forming Earth Guard
his plan was...
...to assemble the brothers from Blocks 9 and 1 0
plus our home delivery team, waiters and bartenders
then we can form an unified Earth Guard to ensure that justice is done
if you insist on justice justice will kill all the people around you
as a cop, I am prepared for death
Really?
the protective uniforms designed by Big Bird have arrived
we also have 5 delivery cars which were all fixed by Big Bird 4 of us can share 1 car
big Bird has done so much. His only hope...
...was more people could join our Earth Guard
someone will come for you
I want you to watch your rescuer die
how he dies for justice
do you believe there are Ultramen in this world?
big Bird said Ultramen are everywhere
I used to think he was so dumb
but now...
I believe
that Ultramen is everywhere in this world
let's go
where to?
I will go beat up the scoundrels
big Bird was killed by them
we used to beat him up too
that's right. We may die if we go
have you thought carefully?
have you thought about this
in our whole lives, have we ever been stylishly brave for once?
big Bird has always treated me as the Captain but I have never shouldered the responsibility of a captain
you have always loved fighting but not once was worthwhile
however, some people really have to be beaten up
do you remember the day my father died?
there is a price to pay...
if justice is to be done
he was willing to dash out like that for a stranger
today, I finally understand why he did that
because it is our responsibility
we are very old anyway
besides
besides, we have learned martial arts
if we just do home delivery, it would be a huge waste
shall we reserve a place for the boss?
are you ready to go?
tonight, Earth Guard eventually discharges its duty
I will bring Big Bird along...
...to rescue a person whom we believe is worth the effort
let's set off, friends!
what is the total cost of the uniforms?
get me 11 suits
run, son!
mom, I didn't fight because of this medal
I know, you want to punish the bad guys
Yes! Next time when I punish the bad guys
I will notify you
you can count me out
by the way,
I prefer...
daddy's badge
justice Set D 2 more bowls of beat-up-the-bad-guy noodle
big bad guy or small bad guy?
big, of course
here come the fresh pineapple buns!
sir, it's wrong to jump the queue
you will get your bun
but if you don't follow the rules we will use the Mantis Boxing on you
it was a good fight
but you couldn't protect the glass of water
God Sigma rules the universe
the 3 loyal warriors
with courage and passion he is like a righteous big child
flying in the starry sky
neighbours, here come the egg tarts!
great! Eat while it's hot
dear neighbours, how do you do?
help! Ghost!
this young man with such a hot temper must be Brother Siu Sheung
dear neighbours, you don't have to scream
in fact I am Big Bird's little brother
little Bird
Oh, Little Bird
I come to inherit my brother's post...
...as the Vice Captain of Earth Guard
look!
I have already put on the uniform
teammates, granny's pocket money has been stolen!
let's go!

first you meet somebody, then you have a relationship.
Oh, thank you, Dr. Ruth.

And?
he said, "I'll discuss it with Carly."
you cut too deep.
never show it to the authorbefore you give it to me first, okay?

I'm in 23B.
I'll take that for you. Thank you.
Hey, why are you walking here?
forgive me, I don't usually follow women around.
I'm not a dirty old man, really not.
are you certain? Sometimes I wish I were, but I'm not.
why do you wish you were? 'Cause it's boring when you're not.
you just really...Well, you look like someone.
someone you likeor someone you dislike?
Oh, no. I liked her a lot.
what's really strange is...
she was in 20B as well.
Naomi Singer.

she jumped out the window.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...I've never had much goddamned tact.
I tell you what. I'm about to go off to Japan.

have you grown tired of the Village?
Oh, I teach all aspects of it. Cameras, camcorders...
this way.
now, why don't you talkto Lynn Nesbit about him?
his last book didn't sell very well. Perhaps he's getting itchy at Random.
perhaps he's blaming their marketingand not the thinness of his characters.
perhaps you can convince Lynnto alert him to the inadequacies...
of their marketing department. Are we negotiating, Alex?
Oh, I wouldn't call it that.
he's an attractive man, isn't he?
Alex, I ask you for a raise, and you take me out to lunch...
and try to set me up.
Jack Landsford.
shred of Evidence, Flesh and Blood, police procedurals.
he hasn't written anythingin five or six years...
but he made so much off ofFlesh and Blood, he doesn't have to.
he's got a ranch in Montana.
and speak of the devil. Hello, Alex.
how are you? All right.
I'm the devil.
Carla Norris. Hello.
you look familiar to me.
maybe that's becauseI live in your building.
Oh, yeah.
Jack, Carly is a big fan of yours. She just loved Flesh and Blood.
Hey. I haven't read it.
I'm sorry.
here you are, sir. She hasn't read me.
Alex, why is it she hasn't read me?
everybody's read me. I'm easy to read.
well, I haven't.
she has better taste than I thought.
she'll read me, though.
what if she doesn't likewhat she reads?
Hi, Jack. You'll read me.
I know you'll read me. Because you have good taste.
you've lost her now, Jack. She likes being in control.
so do I.
see you around the neighborhood. Yeah.
Alex.
I spend seven years in a bad marriage, and you say I like being in control?
but you ended it, didn't you?
no. No way.
no.

Yeah, I know it's not fucking Vogue. So what?
well, it's your choice.
look, I'm hungry, I'm jetlagged, andI don't need this shit. Goodbye, Michael.
God, I'm sorry. I'm gonna get thoseright out of your way.
that's okay. I'm Vida.
Carly Norris. Hi.
I'll give you a hand. Thanks.
damn doormen. I really tip them well, too.
everybody does.
that's why they're never aroundwhen you need them.
you're right. You should see them at Christmas.
like flies on shit then.
Oh, yeah, this guy was here.
he left this for you.
you're all moved in, then? Oh, God, no. I hate it.
I know.
you know, you look like... Yeah, the girl that...
Naomi. Yeah.
somebody's already told you. I guess they would have.
were you friends? Well, sort of.
I mean, she was only here about a year.
and most of that time, I was in Milan.
Asspinching Italians.
I couldn't believe it, though.
I mean, she just didn't seem like the type.
were you here when she... Yeah.
she came overto borrow some coffee the night before.
I didn't have any. Caffeine withdrawal.
that would do it to me.
that's my agent. He's a slimy bastard.
just a goddamned second, all right, Michael?
Hey. Thanks.
right. So see you around.
if you ever needany coffee or anything...
just make sure you don't run out.
Mr. Brown. That's original. And where's he staying?
okay.
and what's his room number?
627, got it.
Yeah, well, they all saythey're producers or sheiks.
Hi, putz. I'm giving youyour last chance for Pavarotti.
Hey, isn't Pearl Jamsome sort of oriental sex thing?
yummy.
Carla, this is Zeke Hawkins calling.
I hope you remember me.
I live in the building, too.
we met in the lobby when you weremoving in last weekend?
anyway, listen, I was just callingto let you know that if you...

I'm at home most of the day. My number's 5553126.
all righty? Okay, bye.
Hi, it's Peter. We are moving upthe pub date on the Dean book.

Yeah, but what aboutthe appointment with Sony in Osaka?
11: 30 on Monday?
Oh, well, I'll do it anytime they will.
I mean, I have to see them. They're stateoftheart.
...defensive systemis extraordinarily developed.
acute schizophrenic, nonparanoid.
classic JekyllandHyde syndrome.
clearly a great danger to women.
no, no, no. It's so good to hear your voice.
...we could rent one.
well, that's an idea.
Hi, Zeke. It's Carla Norris.
thanks for your call. I...
if I ever get unpacked around here...
I was thinking of havinga cocktail party on Friday night.
sometime after 6: 00.
and I was wonderingif you'd like to come.
okay, I hope that you do. Byebye.
brother!
Oh, you think that was funny? Yeah.
I didn't think that was funny. You scared the shit out of me.
Yeah, yeah, I know. I know.
I'm sorry. You're right, it wasn't funny. I...
it was a real dumbass thing to do. Really, I'm sorry.
can we start over again? Huh?
what for? I really don't see the point.
Hey, did you get the books? Yeah.
did you read them? No.
Yeah, you did. You can't fool me.
I read a few pages of one of them.
you read both of them. You couldn't put them down.
I'm right, aren't l? Tell me I'm right.
you're wrong.
what?
you don't like sex and violence? It sells, you know.
it buys ranches in Montana, I'm told.
you've been checking on me. I like that.
thank you. For what?
for stopping.
now, how about gossip? About James Dean, for instance.
doesn't that sell?
you've been checking on me. I don't like that.
I hear you're very good at the tellalls.
I guess that comesfrom being married to a very boring guy.
you just like all the juicy talk.
fuck you. Would you like to?
I can try and make myself available. Hey, look...
come on, I'm a writer. People tell me their secrets...
and I just take notes. Like Truman Capote.
you could tell me your secrets. I don't have any secrets.
sure you do.
what secrets do I have?
I'd never tell.
did you send me the telescope?
telescope? Yeah.
why would I send you a telescope?
I can't keep up with you.
no, you can't.
Taxi!
excuse me, Officers, let her through, please. She lives here. Come on.
come on, Miss Norris. Come on.
do you live here? Did you know Mr. Hale?
how long have you livedin this apartment?
how do you feelabout all these accidents?
Yes, he was a lecturer at NYU.
he doesn't seem to have hadany family. That's about all I know.
miss? Miss?
are you a resident here? Yeah. Carla Norris...
what happened? The guy in 23B...
the professor, Gus Hale...
apparently he fell in the showerand broke his neck.
did you know Mr. Hale?
I talked to him. What about?
well, not that much, really. We talked about...
that he was going to Japan.
we talked about Naomi Singer. What did he say about Naomi Singer?
that they were friends, and...
that I look like her.
you do.
I don't remembergiving you an invitation.
I have a nosefor smelling parties in progress.
also, a bottle of Dom Perignon.
come on in, honey. I like you already.
you hold and I'll pop. Yeah.
Jack Landsford, I'd like to introduce you...
to Judy, of course.
Hi. Remember me? We met in the doorway?
and Peter. Hi. How are you?
Pete. Hey, Alex. Jack, how are you?
good. How you been? And you know Vida.
Hi, I'm Vida Warren. Hello. Jack Landsford.
I'm sorry. I thought you two knew each other.
say "cheese."
Jesus!
Oh, hey. Hello. Here you go.
is this Dom Perignon, too? California red.
Oh. I'm sorry.
now, this is very interesting.
it looks like Lalique, but it's not. It's a copy.
you're right about that, Alex.
nothing in the haunted houseis what it appears to be.
they've remodeled it completely.
who owns it?
I heard it was some law firm downtown.
no. That's a false front. I checked on that once.
I bet I could find out who owns it.
I know some people.
I could make a few callsif you really want to know.
Pete, don't.
it could be the Mob.
then what are we gonna do? Move out?
there's an idea.
thank you.
it's a great party. Thank you.
hey there. Can I get you something?
I'm fine, thanks.
so, how do you like the new place? Oh, yeah.
did you know Naomi Singer?
not really. I saw her around a few times.
I wonder why she did it.
Yeah. I don't know, I think I readsomething about boyfriend troubles.
Oh, they're doing it!
Oh, they are! I can't believe it!
something exciting happening.
I don't believe it. They are!
let me see. Let me see.
Oh, they sure are.
would you look at her? She's a voyeur. She can't get enough.
I am not. Yes, you are.
that's why you have this telescopeout here.
it's not even mine! You're a peeper! A peeper!
somebody gave this to me.
right. Everybody has a telescope.
I don't. I do.
thank you. I do, too.
I'm shocked. I'm truly shocked. You people are shameless.
you're all shameless. What is with you guys?
will you look at that? Come on, Alex.
hurry up, before they finish. Just a moment.
I wanna look, too.
Oh, my God!
it looks like they're being Rolfed.
Bye. Bye. Bye.
Goodnight. Thank you for coming. Thanks. Bye.
Goodnight. Bye.
Goodnight. And thanks for the wine.
sorry about the California red. I like California red.
Goodnight. Goodnight.
listen, do you work out?
you mean, like exercise bikes and stuff?
no, no. The real thing. Weights.
you want to check it out? Oh. No, thank you.
you would have a great time.
what do you think? Tomorrow morning, maybe?
you know, there are mirrorsall over those places.
there are no mirrors.
they're everywhere you look.
no mirrors. Promise.
what do you say? 10: 00? I'll call you?
I'll call you. Bye.
that was a great party.
I thank you.
you're welcome.
who knows, maybe next timeI'll even get an invitation, huh?
maybe. Oh, you got to be careful.
maybe means "yes"to an old exjournalist like myself.
the operative word being "ex."
Yeah.
but us investigative reportersnever lose the instinct...
to jump in at the slightest opening.
that would explain you jumping outat me in the park, then, I guess.
no.
that was a tactic I developedin junior high school to get the babes.
it didn't work then, either.
you don't go out much, do you?
I thought...
maybe in lieu of the gym...
you might want to go to dinner with me.
maybe.
I'll take that maybe as a yes.
Goodnight, Carla. Goodnight, Jack.
...should climb to about 69 degrees.
humidity levels slipping to about 15%.
clouds and rain to returnwith possible showers on Monday.

Hello?

what's the matter? Jesus!

I hear something in my office.
what the hell happened? I was...
the lights went out, and...
the door was jammed, and then I heard this sound. I just...
look, it must have jammed.
come on. I think all thishaunted house crap is getting to you.
I don't believe it. You're such a liar.
well, well, well. Looks like they musthave put up a few mirrors in here, huh?
Yeah, overnight, right?
come on. Come on. The locker room's right over here.
you conned me into this.
it'll be fun. Trust me.
okay. Your turn.
I can't do that. Oh, yes, you can.
come on. I'll teach you.
okay.
great. Great.
just want to keep your hips straight.
anyone ever tell youyou've got a very nice butt?
I already know you're a liar. You do.
nobody's told me that in a long time.
well, that's because the wrong peoplehave been looking at it.
that's true.
how often do you work out? Three, four times a week.
I'm starving. How about you?
Yeah.
how do you find the time?
I work at home. I design computer video games.
Oh, yeah?
you think I'm too young for you, don't you?
what?
you do, don't you? No.
I wasn't thinking about that. Liar.
Yes, you were.
I'm not.
you like it?
Yeah. I love it. I play it all the time.
so you really do have the beer. I told you it wasn't a ruse.
thank you.
what's that? A volcano.
I've always loved them.
I'd like to fly into one sometime.
Why?
I don't know. It sounds like fun.
don't you think?
I have to go.
please, I... It's okay.
you're so beautiful, Carly.
they'll see.
I want to see.
I want to see you.
it's okay.
it's okay. I'm here.
what are you worried about?
somebody's watching youlike you watch them?
why don't you come over herewith me and lie down?
Why? So you can talk dirty to mesome more?
please?
Oh, I have to go.
it's my building, Carly. I own it.
I even helped redesign it.
my father owneda bunch of hotels, so I...
I inherited a lot of money.
and I didn't want to be bothered with a lot of hassles...
so I just don't tell people that I own it.
did you tell Mrs. McEvoyto give me special treatment?
no.
but I did approveyour application quickly.
you had me all plotted out, huh?
I just thought we would like each other.
you're not angry with me, are you?
boy, have I got something to tell you. You're not going to believe it!
this is Judy. Will you call me?
where have you been? I've been trying to call you all day.
something's going on, I can smell it.
you've probably been havingmultiple orgasms.
you've probably beenfucking your brains out.
I have.
Carly, Alex is all over meabout the Dean book.
please, please work on itthis weekend. Bye.
Goodnight.
sleep tight, don't let the bedbugs bite.
you do look like you fuckedyour brains out. Look at you.
what are you smiling at? That damn eclair?
I'm just smiling. That's all. Tell me.
I want to know everything. Every little grunt. Every little wiggle.
there's nothing to tell.
you've been spending too much timewith your vibrator.
I certainly have. I'm getting a plastic yeast infection.
who is he? Do I know him? Tell me.
tell me. You met him.
I met him? And I didn't pin himto the wall and ravish him myself?
and you got him? Now I'm pissed. Who?
it's Zeke. You met him at my apartment.
that gorgeous, young, incredible...Oh, my God, I hate you.
I really hate you. How is he?
give me the goods. Is he insatiable? I bet he's insatiable.
they all are at that age. Lead pencils, that's what they are.
I hate you. I really, really hate you.
I mean, I go awaywith the other one, right...
for what I think is going to bea hot, steamy weekend...
and you're reloading a lead pencil.
I must have done something terriblein my past life.
wait. You went off with who? Jack Landsford.
who's not even a sharpened pencil, let me tell you.
we went to Montauk. Stayed in a cabin.
what happened? Nothing. Not a damn thing.
the earth definitely did not move.
all he did was ask about you. You know, you should go out with him.
just to find out for meif he's even got a pencil.
I'll bet it's something blue.
something intimate.
something lacy.
something whorish.
how did you get in here?
the door was open.
I've lived in New York for 10 yearsand I've never left my door open.
well, maybe you did this time.
maybe the super did. I don't think so. I want you to leave.
he was having an affairwith Naomi Singer.
maybe she smelt like flowers, too.
maybe you twouse the same spermicide.
I'm calling... She was seeing a shrink.
she told the shrink about your boyfriend.
and after Naomi was murdered, the shrink told the police.
he's not my boyfriend.
Oh? Well, what the hell is he, then?
the neighborhood florist? I saw you two in the lobby together.
I'm not blind.
my God, you really do look like her.
she died right here.
she went off that balcony.
you don't really knowwhat you're dealing with, do you?
he's fucked up.
he's so very, very sick.
you don't believe me, do you?
all right. Here.
you call Lieutenant Hendrix.
go on. Ask her.
your boyfriend owns the building.
I bet you didn't know that, did you?
I'll bet he didn't tell you, did he?
Yes, he did.
you know how difficult it wasfor the police to discover that?
this guy has more false fronts, more highpowered attorneys...
than Richard fucking Nixon!
you know what I think?
I think you can't write anymore.
and I think you're making this upto hide the fact that you can't.
I'm sorry for you, Jack.
I really am.
but if I ever find youin my apartment again...
I'm gonna have youthrown out of the building.
goodbye.
are you hungry?
I've already eaten. Liar.
you're afraid of me.
do I look like a girlwho would be frightened of you?
I did sort of come on strong yesterday.
well, I came on strong, too.
do you want to go out for some truffles?
truffles?
now? Yeah, why not? I love truffles.
I don't have anything to wear. Wear what I sent you.
meet me downstairs in one hour.
hurry. One hour.
Taxi! Did you think I wasn't coming?
no.
I knew you wanted me to thinkthat you weren't coming.
you look good enough to eat.
are you ready to order yet, sir? Not yet, thank you.
very well, sir.
your check, sir. Oh, thank you very much.
what? Nothing.
you like playing games, don't you?
I like playing gameswith people who like playing games.
what game do I like to play?
Scrabble?
I hate Scrabblebecause I'm awful at Scrabble.
I like poker, though. So do I.
would you like to play? Now?
right now.
the police came to see me today.
found out I owned the buildingand were asking all sorts of questions...
about the wiring.
I had such a terrible day, I couldn't get any work done.
are we playing poker now?
we're about to start.
did you like the bra and panties?
Yes.
are you wearing them?
maybe.
I think you are.
show me.
right here? Right here.
I'm sorry. I can't see that. I'm nearsighted.
can you see this?
Yes.
what about the panties?
panties?
Yes. The panties.
are you wearing the panties?
forget it.
I win, you lose, this game.
I can't tell.
I win, you lose.
this game.
are you ready to order yet, sir?
where are we going?
thirteen. It's an unlucky number.
it's an unlucky apartment building.
good night.
put these on.
I wouldn't want you to catch a draft.
I'm okay. I'm pretty warm down there.
see you soon.
Zeke?
Zeke?
Hello?
damn you. You left the door open.
you knew I'd come.
I thought we came together.
did you and Naomi come together?
I hardly knew her. I told you.
she told someoneyou had an affair with her.
that's crazy. She came on to me once.
maybe she fantasized.
I heard she had an affairwith your friend.
what friend? Your writer friend, Jack.
who told you that? Your neighbor Vida.
she told me at your party. No big deal.
if you stay, you could wake up in my arms.
we could kiss to start the day.
I could make you breakfast.
we could go for a walk in the parkand hold hands.
am I scaring you again?
I don't wanna get hurt.
Hi. This is Vida. Leave a message.
Vida? Vida, are you there? It's Carly Norris.
vida, I need to talk to youabout something.
can you give me a call?
it's really important.
Hello? Jack, it's Carly Norris.
Hi.
look, clearly this isnone of my business, but...
vida told me that it was you...
that was having an affairwith Naomi Singer.
that's bullshit.
vida tell you that?
no, I think your boyfriendtold you that, didn't he?
vida didn't tell you that, did she?
Hey, Vida.
Hi, I got your message. I'll call you tonight.
I've got a job and I'm really late.
I just...
I just wanted to...
look, I don't wanna get caught in there.
vida, I wanted to talk to you. Yeah, I'll call you later, okay?
well, okay.
shit.
fucking building.
you just lie there. Be still.
are you happy now? Are you happy?
Carly?
Oh, Jesus!
Carly, don't run!
did Miss Warren know Jack Landsford?
I think so.
because I saw Jack and Vidaon the street.
when was that? About a week ago.
Jack was giving her some money.
this isn't your knife, is it, Jack?
I don't think so.
Hey, Jack, you know Vida Warren?
no. I mean, yeah.
I met her once at Carly Norris' party.
you're somewhat of a player, aren't you, Jack?
with the ladies, I mean.
I date, sure. So do you, McCracken, you hump.
were you dating Vida Warren? No.
Oh, Jack. We got a problem.
we found these pictures of youall over her apartment.
those are my publicity photos. I keep them in my desk.
he set me up.
God damn it, he set me up! Who set you up, Jack?
Zeke Hawkins, the guy in 13A. You talked to him yet?
well, why would he wantto do that, Jack?
a woman.
a woman. What woman?
Naomi Singer. Remember her?
the suicide? Yeah.
you got any idea why this Singerwoman would wanna kill herself, Jack?
no. Hey, you guys know me. I'm trying to find out. That's my craft.
were you seeing her, Jack?
Yeah.
I mean, we got women dying all overthe place around you, don't we, Jack?
Hey, fuck you, McCracken. Hey, fuck you, Jack!
back off, McCracken, will you?
Mac. Take it easy, Jack.
Jesus Christ. You tell him to take it easy.
what's the matter with you guys? You know me. I didn't do this.
I want my attorney. All right.
you spent part of the yearup in Montana.
you got some kind of a ranchup there, Jack?
Yeah, so what?
what's the name of that place? The name?
Yeah, the name. The Flying L.
the Flying L, huh?
you parking your horsein Vida Warren's closet, pardner?
I want my attorney down here now. All right.
I want him now! You'll get him.
the D. A.'s gonna charge him.
he will make bail.
he's coming back here, isn't he?
we'll know it if he does.
how will we know? He could be there right now.
let's see if he is.
come on.
you know my mother was an actresson the soaps?
she used to spendmost of the year in LA.
I used to take a cab home from schooland watch her on TV.
that was just about my life with her.
I had it custombuilt in Osaka.
it cost me $6 million.
he's not there.
we'll know if he is, though.
tomorrow night. Yeah, I have to be in at 5: 00.
no, it's just me. Can you believe it? There must have been 600 girls there.
put my apartment on.
there's nobody home there, either.
aren't you gonna come meet us?
Yeah, we're gonna be there inabout a half hour, if I can get ready.
no, I think Henry will be there.
no, he just called me, like, 20 minutes ago.
what does that haveto do with anything?
my God, have you slept with her?
did you sleep with her? Simple question, Will.
you're making me do somethingI don't want to do.
I know.
you watch them?
you watch these people? So do you, Carly, with your telescope.
Oh, you... I just have better technology.
you want gossip? I'll give you real gossip. Real life, Carly.
it's better than any book. Better than any movie.
it's a soap opera. It's real life.
it's a tragedy, it's funny, it's sad, it's unpredictable.
look for yourself, Carly. It's wrong.
it's the same as your James Dean book.
only nobody gets hurt.
you ready? Yes...
they don't even know.
open the door, Zeke.
look, Carly, don't...
I love you.
give me a little bit more time, for God's sake!
you will ride with your dad, okay? That's it. No more.
he's not my father, and I'm not ridingwith him alone. I don't...
Jonnie, get back in here! Jonnie! Come here.
you be nicer to him!
he touches me. Stop it!
he puts his hands on me, Mom, every chance he gets.
don't start. I don't wanna hear it.
he is a decent, hardworking man.
I hate him! I hate him!
don't you... I hate you, Mom! I hate you!
the little girl's right. Every chance he gets.
I hate him, Pony, I really do. I hate him.
whenever the mother's not around, he's got his hands all over her.
why don't you give it a try? You just have to tap the touch screen.
would you like something to eat? I'm not hungry.
you haven't eaten anything all day.
you're like a kid with a new toy.
but it's not a toy, is it?
no.
are you the onethat sent me the telescope?
Yes.
why did you do it?
not now, honey.
what did the xray show?
some kind of shadow, that's all.
don't worry about it. It could be anything.
baby, please tell me everything. What did he say?
he said it might be a tumor. A tumor?
were you watching Vidawhen she got killed?
no. The lights had gone downin the stairwell.
what about the others?
I wasn't watching.
I did see Gus Haleon the floor of the shower, though.
I was the one who called the police.
do you tape these?
Yes.
did you tape us?
would you like to see?
Yes.
there's so much on this tape.
come on, where is it?
you see, sometimes I just let it runon record in one apartment for a while.
like my own little soap opera.
I don't even have the timeto watch most of what I record.
it's amazing what I've foundon some of these tapes.
good morning.
Oh, God. Are you all right?
Carly. I'm fine.
we've been so worried about you. Everybody's been calling.
Yeah, and to think I spent the weekendwith an impotent maniac...
hoping that he'd, you know...The police even talked to me.
Carly Norris.
Carly, will you come and see me later... It's Zeke Hawkins.
...and tell me the real skinny?
I wanna hear everything, darling.
Hello? Hey, guess what?
I called Ballinger at his office, you knowthe guy who can't keep his hands...off his stepdaughter?
I told him if he ever touched her again, I'd kill him.
what did he do? He panicked, that's what he did.
I just wish you could have heard him.
Hey, maybe we shouldstart wiring the whole town, huh?
that way we could see everything.
you there, Carly?
I don't know what to do.
just come home, you.
Bye. Bye.
don't you scream. Don't. I'm not gonna hurt you.
he set me up, Carly. Zeke set me up.
I believe you. I do, I believe you.
it's okay. Let me go. Let me go.
he's sick. That man is sick.
his mother died when he was 17. She was a soap opera actress.
do you know how she died? She fell.
she fell? She fell in the shower.
look! What?
look, Carly. Thea Manning. That's his mother, Carly.
who does she look like? Oh, she...
she looks like you, Carly.
Hello? Hi, it's me.
Hey, are you coming down?
why don't you come over here? Why? What's up?
well, because I have a surprise for you.
great. I'll be right there.
okay.
sit down. Okay.
Hey, you. Hi.
a little dark in here, don't you think?
he's got a gun! Sit down! All right, you bastard!
you tell the truth now, or I'll blow your brains out.
what the hell are you talking about? You killed Naomi Singer.
no, I didn't.
how'd your mother die, Zeke? My mother?
Yeah, she fell in the shower, wasn't that it?
she had an aneurysm and fell.
she fell in the showerthe way you killed Gus Hale.
Gus Hale? Yeah, and he killed Vida, too.
didn't you? Didn't you?
three now, Jack? I killed three people?
first of all, I didn'teven know Naomi Singer.
but you did, Jack.'Cause I saw you with her.
so I knowwhy you would want to kill her.
what do you mean, you saw us?
I also saw her give you a keyto this apartment, right, Jack?
is that how he got in herethis time, huh?
is it? You still have the key, don't you?
why don't you show it to us, Jack? What the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about the fact that youjust couldn't get it up, could you, Jack?
I saw that, too. Is that why you killed her, Jack?
is it? Is it? He's lying, Carly. He's lying.
Jack, I don't know what to believe.
just show me the key.
no, Jack! No.
Jack, let go! Jack. No!
Oh, my...
because he was already in this room, but I didn't see him.
and when he came out, I saw that he had a gun.
he started screaming at me.
and...
sorry.
then we wrestled aroundon the ground.
and...
the gun skidded across the floor there...
and I picked it up.
how did he get in?
your door wasn't forced.
he must have had a key.
I mean, it was just like before. He was already in here.
he had these in his pocket.
try them.
Jack Landsford's got a sheet with us. He's a known offender.
assaulted his exwife more than once. She dropped charges.
I wish she hadn't.
maybe we wouldn'thave two women dead.
he didn't get in with these.
you guys about done here? Finished.
where? Floor, next to the counter.
this yours?
no.
bingo.
well, that wraps it.
the D. A.'s gonna need to see you bothtomorrow morning...
down at the precinct. Say, 9: 30?
you know where it is.
let's secure it.
I don't...
I don't want to stay here tonight.
stay with me.
stay with me.
okay?
Jonnie, can we talk for a minute?
have you told anyone that I...
just Mom. You're sure?
Jonnie, I'm sorry.
it was just, I couldn't help myself.
it'll never happen again. I swear it. Never.
it's like playing God.
we'll only do good things. I don't want to do this.
I want my privacy. I want my own experiences.
Zeke, I want to have a real relationship.
Carly, I love you. You can have anything you want.
I want my tape.
if I have you, I don't need them, right?
hold on.
erased.
you okay? Yeah.
tired.
and hungry, I guess.
I'll go get something for us. What would you like?
anything.
you're so beautiful.
you're so beautiful, Vida.
you're so beautiful, Vida.
you smell so good.
you smell so good.
I love you, Naomi.
I love you. You smell like roses.
Carly.
come on. Come on, open the door! Let's go. Open up!
Hey, come on!
Carly...
you're watching me, aren't you?
are you looking at me?
you're looking at me. I can tell, I can feel it.
I love you, Carly.
Carly, let me in. Come on.
peekaboo. You see me.
come on, open the door. Now.
now, Carly! Open the fucking door!
come on, open this cocksucking door, now!
open up! Come on!
open up the fucking door, Carly, now!
you like to watch? Watch this.
Carly! No, stop!
those women meant nothing to me.
it was just sex, Carly.
I love you.
that was the past.
what we have is so powerful, Carly. Can't you feel it?
it feels so good.
you can feel it, can't you?
give me the gun, Carly.
I love you, Carly.
Carly!
Carly, please! Please don't!
Carly, please don't!
Carly!
get a life.
...whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend.
he traveled the land in search of worthy foes.
I see you like to chew. Maybe you should chew on my fist!
the warrior said nothing for his mouth was full.
then he swallowed. And then he spoke.
enough talk. Let's fight!
Shashabooey!
he was so deadly in fact that his enemies would go blind from overeXposure to pure awesomeness.
my eyes! - He's too awesome!
and attractive. - How can we repay you?
there is no charge for awesomeness.
or attractiveness.
kablooey!
it mattered not how many foes he faced.
they were no match for his bodacity!
never before had a panda been so feared! And so loved.
even the most heroic heroes in China the Furious Five bowed in respect to this great master.
we should hang out.
agreed.
but hanging out would have to wait.
because when you're facing the 10 000 demons of Demon Mountain there's only one thing that matters and that's...
Po! Get up!
you'll be later for work!
what?
Po! Get up!
Po. What are you doing up there?
nothing.
monkey! Mantis! Orane! Viper! Tigress!
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.
coming!
sorry Dad.
sorry doesn't make the noodles.
what were you doing up there? All that noise.
nothing. I just had a crazy dream.
about what?
what were you dreaming about?
what was I...?
I was dreaming about...
...noodles.
noodles? You were really dreaming about noodles?
Yeah. What else would I be dreaming about?
careful! That soup is sharp.
Oh happy day!
my son finally having the noodle dream!
you don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment.
this is a sign Po.
a sign of what?
you are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant!
as I took it over from my father who took it over from his father...
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.
dad Dad Dad it was just a dream.
no it was the dream.
we are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins.
but Dad didn't you ever want to do something else?
something besides noodles?
actually when I was young and crazy
I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.
why didn't you?
because it was a stupid dream.
can you imagine me making tofu?
tofu.
No! We all have our place in this world.
mine is here and yours is...
I know is here.
no it's at tables 2 5 7 and 12
service with a smile.
well done students... if you were trying to disappoint me.
Tigress you need more ferocity! Monkey greater speed.
Orane height. Viper subtlety. Mantis...
master Shifu. - What?!
it's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.
master Oogway you summoned me? Is something wrong?
why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?
so nothing's wrong?
well I didn't say that.
you were saying?
I have had a vision.
Tai Lung will return.
that is impossible! He is in prison.
nothing is impossible.
Zeng!
fly to Ohorh-Gom prison and tell them to double the guards double their weapons double everything!
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!
yes Master Shifu!
one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
we must do something! We can't let him march on the valley take his revenge!
he'll...
your mind is like this water my friend.
when it is agitated it becomes difficult to see.
but if you allow it to settle...
...the answer becomes clear.
the Dragon Scroll.
it is time.
but who? Who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power?
to become the Dragon Warrior?
I don't know.
excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.
watch it!
sorry. Suck it up!
sorry. A thousand pardons.
what?
master Oogway's choosing the Dragon Warrior! Today!
everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!
we've waited 1 000 years for this! Take the bowl!
this is the greatest day in kung fu history! Just go!
Po! Where are you going?
to the Jade Palace.
you're forgetting your noodle cart.
the whole valley will be there and you'll sell noodles to all of them.
selling noodles?
but Dad I was thinking maybe I...
yeah? - I was thinking maybe I...
...could also sell the bean buns. They're about to go bad.
that's my boy!
I told you that dream was a sign.
Yeah. Glad I had it.
I'm a kung fu warrior! - Me too!
there's spots at the top. - Let's go.
come on. Come on!
almost there.
what?
No! Oh no!
sorry Po. - We'll bring you back a souvenir.
no. I'll bring me back a souvenir.
it is an historic day.
isn't it Master Oogway?
yes and one I feared I would not live to see.
are your students ready?
yes Master Oogway.
know this old friend.
whomever I choose will not only bring peace to the valley...
...but also to you.
let the tournament begin!
let the tournament begin!
Yeah.
no no wait!
I'm coming! Wait wait!
Yes!
Hey! Open the door!

Oitizens of the Valley of Peace it is my great honor to present to you... Tigress!
Viper! Orane! Monkey! Mantis!
the Furious Five!
yeah the Furious Five!
warriors prepare!
wait. No. Oh peeky-hole.
ready for battle! - Yeah.
the Thousand Tongues of Fire.
look at that.
Hey! Get out of the way!
and finally Master Tigress!
and believe me citizens you have not seen anything yet.
I know!
master Tigress! Face Iron OX and his Blades of Death.
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.
Oitizens of the Valley of Peace
master Oogway will now choose the Dragon Warrior!
Oh no! No no wait!
Yeah.
Po!
what are you doing?!
what does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!
but I don't understand. You finally had the noodle dream!
I lied. I don't dream about noodles Dad.
I love kung fu!
come on son. Let's get back to work.
OK.
come back!
what's going on?
Where...?
what are you pointing...?
OK. Sorry.
I just wanted to see who the Dragon Warrior was.
how interesting.
master are you pointing at me?
him. - Who?
you. - Me?
the universe has brought us the Dragon Warrior!
what? - What?!
What?! - What?!
stop wait! Who told you to...?
master Oogway wait.
that flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to our problem.
you were about to point at Tigress and that thing fell in front of her!
that was just an accident!
there are no accidents.
forgive us Master. We have failed you.
no. If the panda has not quit by morning then I will have failed you.
wait! Wait wait wait! I bring a message...
...from Master Shifu.
What?!
double the guard?!
extra precautions?!
your prison may not be adequate?!
you doubt my prison security?!
absolutely not.
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.
I'll give you a message for your Master Shifu.
escape from Ohorh-Gom prison is impossible!
Lmpressive isn't it?
it's very impressive.
it's very impressive.
one way in one way out.
one thousand guards and one prisoner.
yes eXcept that prisoner...
...is Tai Lung.
take us down.
what are you doing?
Oh my.
behold Tai Lung.
I'm just gonna wait right here.
it's nothing to worry about. It's perfectly safe.
Orossbows! At the ready!
Orossbows?
hey tough guy did you hear?
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon Scroll and it's not gonna be you.
don't get him mad.
what's he gonna do about it? I've got him completely immobilized.
did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?
I'm good. I've seen enough.
I'll tell Shifu he has nothing to worry about.
no he doesn't.
I'll tell him that.
can we please go now?
dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!
wait a second!
I think there's been a slight mistake. Everyone seems to think that I'm...
the Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!
look at this place.
master Flying Rhino's armor with authentic battle damage!
the Sword of Heroes!
said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking.
the Invisible Trident of Destiny!
I've only seen paintings of that painting.
No!
the legendary Urn of Whispering Warriors.
said to contain the souls of the entire Tenshu Army.
hello.
have you finished sight-seeing?
sorry I should have come to you first.
my patience is wearing thin.
well I mean it's not like you were going anywhere.
would you turn around? - Sure.
how's it going?
how do you get 5 000... Master Shifu!
someone... broke that.
but I'll fiX it. Do you have some...
...glue?
a splinter.
so you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?
I guess so. - Wrong!
you are not the Dragon Warrior. You will never be the Dragon Warrior until...
...you have learned the secret of the Dragon Scroll.
so how does this work?
do you have a ladder or a trampoline or...?
you think it's that easy? That I'll just hand you the secret - to limitless power? - No I...
one must first master the highest level of kung fu.
and that is impossible if that one is someone like you.
someone like me?
yes look at you! This fat butt! Flabby arms!
those are sensitive in the flabby parts.
and this ridiculous belly.
and utter disregard for personal hygiene.
now wait a minute. That's uncalled for.
don't stand that close. I can smell your breath.
listen Oogway said I was...
the WuXi Finger Hold. Not the WuXi Finger Hold!
Oh you know this hold?
developed by Master WuXi in the Third Dynasty.
then you know what happens when I fleX my pinky.
no no! - You know the hardest part of this?
the hardest part is cleaning up afterwards.
OK OK take it easy.
now listen closely panda.
Oogway may have picked you but when I'm through with you
I promise you you're going to wish he hadn't! Are we clear?
yeah we're clear. We're so clear.
good.
I can't wait to get started.
let's begin. - Wait wait wait.
what?
now? - Yes now.
unless the great Oogway was wrong and you are not the Dragon Warrior.
Oh OK well...
I don't know if I can do all of those moves.
well if we don't try we'll never know will we?
yeah it's just maybe we can find something more suited to my level.
what level is that?
well I'm not a master but...
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.
no. There is no such thing as level zero.
maybe I can start with that. - That?
we use that for training children and propping the door open when it's hot.
but if you insist...
the Furious Five!
you're bigger than your action figures. EXcept you Mantis. You're the same.
go ahead panda. Show us what you can do.
are they gonna watch or should I wait till they get back to work?
hit it.
OK yeah. I mean I just ate. So I'm still digesting.
so my kung fu might not be as good as... later on.
just hit it.
all right.
what you got? You got nothing 'cause I got it right here.
you picking on my friends? Get ready to feel thunder.
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.
come on. I'm a blur. You've never seen bear style.
you've only seen praying mantis.
or monkey style.
or I could come at you snickety-snake.
would you hit it!
all right. All right.
why don't you try again? A little harder.
how's that?
that hurts.
this will be easier than I thought.
I'm feeling a little nauseous!
those are hard!
my tenders.
how did I do?
there is now a level zero.
there's no words. - No denying that.
there's no words. - No denying that.
what was Master Oogway thinking?
the poor guy's gonna get himself killed.
he is so mighty!
the Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky on a ball of fire!
when he walks the very ground shakes!
one would think Master Oogway would choose someone who knew kung fu.
yeah or could at least touch his toes.
or even see his toes.
OK.
great.
Hi. You're up.
I am now.
I was just...
some day huh?
that kung fu stuff is hard work right? Are your biceps sore?
I've had a long and rather disappointing day so...
yeah I should probably get to sleep now.
yeah yeah yeah. Of course. - OK thanks.
it's just... Man I'm such a big fan!
you guys were amazing at the Battle of Weeping River.
outnumbered a thousand to one but you didn't stop. You just...
sorry about that.
look you don't belong here.
I know. I know. You're right.
I don't have... I just...
my whole life I dreamed of...
no I meant you don't belong here. I mean in this room. This is my room.
property of Orane.
OK. Right right.
so you want to get to sleep.
Yeah. - I'm keeping you up.
we got big things tomorrow.
all right. You're awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.
what was that?
I didn't say anything.
OK. All right. Good night.
sleep well.
that seemed a little awkward.
master Tigress! I didn't mean to wake you.
you don't belong here. - Yeah of course.
this is your room.
I mean you don't belong in the Jade Palace.
you're a disgrace to kung fu and if you have any respect for who we are and what we do you will be gone by morning.
big fan!
I see you have found the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.
is that what this is? Sorry. I thought it was just a regular peach tree.
I understand. You eat when you are upset.
upset? I'm not upset. What makes you think I'm upset.
so why are you so upset?
I probably sucked more today than anyone in the history of kung fu.
in the history of China. In the history of sucking!
probably.
and the Five! Man you should've seen them! They totally hate me.
totally.
how is Shifu ever going to turn me into the Dragon Warrior?
I mean I'm not like the Five.
I've got no claws no wings no venom.
even Mantis has those... thingies.
maybe I should just quit and go back to making noodles.
quit don't quit.
noodles don't noodles.
you are too concerned with what was and what will be.
there's a saying:
yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift.
that is why it is called the present.
Oh no! - What's happening?!
to your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!
fire crossbows!
fire!
fire!
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.
not going anywhere! Neither is he! - Let go of me!
bring it up!
wait! Bring it back!
he's coming this way! - He won't get far. Archers!
we're dead. So very very dead.
not yet we're not. Now!
can we run now? - Yes.
I'm glad Shifu sent you.
I was beginning to think I'd been forgotten.
fly back there and tell them...
...the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
good morning Master!
panda!
panda!
wake up!
he's quit.
what do we do now with the panda gone? Who will be the Dragon Warrior?
all we can do is resume our training and trust that in time the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.
what are you doing here?!
Hi! Good morning Master!
I thought I'd warm up a little.
you're stuck.
stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?
Nah. This is one of my... Yeah I'm stuck.
help him. - Oh dear.
maybe on three. One two...
...three.
thank you. - Don't mention it.
no really I appreciate... - Ever.
you actually thought you could learn to do a full split in one night?
it takes years to develop one's fleXibility!
and years longer to apply it in combat!
put that down!
the only souvenirs we collect here are bloody knuckles and broken bones.
Yeah! EXcellent.
let's get started.
are you ready? - I was born re...
I'm sorry brother. I thought you said you were ready.
that was awesome! Let's go again!
I've been taking it easy on you panda. But no more.
your next opponent will be me.
all right! Yeah let's go!
step forth.
the true path to victory is to find your opponent's weakness...
...and make him suffer for it.
Oh yeah!
to take his strength and use it against him...
...until he finally falls...
...or quits.
a real warrior never quits.
don't worry Master. I will never quit!
if he's smart he won't come back up those steps.
but he will.
he's not going to quit is he?
he's not going to quit bouncing I'll tell you that.
I thought you said acupuncture would make me feel better.
trust me it will.
it's just not easy finding the right nerve points under all this...
fat? - Fur. I was going to say fur.
sure you were.
who am I to judge a warrior based on his size? Look at me.
I'm over here.
maybe you should look at this again.
Oh OK.
stop it. Stop!
I know Master Shifu is trying to inspire me and all...
...but if I didn't know better I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.
I know he can seem kind of heartless...
...but he wasn't always like that.
according to legend there was once a time when Master Shifu actually used to smile.
No! - Yes.
but that was before.
before what?
before Tai Lung.
we're not really supposed to talk about him.
well if he's going to stay here he should know.
guys guys I know about Tai Lung.
he was a student. The first ever to master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.
and then he turned bad and now he's in jail.
he wasn'tjust a student.
Shifu found him as a cub...
...and he raised him as his son.
and when the boy showed talent in kung fu...
...Shifu trained him.
he believed in him. He told him he was destined for greatness.
it was never enough for Tai Lung.
he wanted the Dragon Scroll.
but Oogway saw darkness in his heart and refused.
outraged Tai Lung laid waste to the valley.
he tried to take the scroll by force.
and Shifu had to destroy what he had created.
but how could he?
Shifu loved Tai Lung like he had never loved anyone before.
or since.
and now he has a chance to make things right.
to train the true Dragon Warrior.
and he's stuck with you.
a big fat panda who treats it like a joke.
that is it!
wait! My fault! I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.
and may have also stopped his heart.
inner peace.
inner peace.
Inner...
inner peace.
would whoever is making that flapping sound quiet down?!
Inner...
Oh Zeng.
excellent.
I could use some good news right now.
master! Master!
I have... It's... It's very bad news.
Shifu.
there is just news. There is no good or bad.
master your vision. Your vision was right.
Tai Lung has broken out of prison. He's on his way.
that is bad news...
...if you do not believe that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.
the panda? Master that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.
he wasn't meant to be here! It was an accident.
there are no accidents.
yes I know. You've said that already.
twice. - Well that was no accident either.
thrice.
my old friend the panda will never fulfill his destiny nor you yours until you let go of the illusion of control.
illusion?
Yes. Look at this tree Shifu.
I cannot make it blossom when it suits me nor make it bear fruit before its time.
but there are things we can control.
I can control when the fruit will fall.
and I can control...
...where to plant the seed.
that is no illusion Master.
Yes.
but no matter what you do that seed will grow to be a peach tree.
you may wish for an apple or an orange but you will get a peach.
but a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
maybe it can.
if you are willing to guide it.
to nurture it.
to believe in it.
but how? How?
I need your help Master.
no you just need to believe.
promise me Shifu.
promise me you will believe.
I will try.
good.
my time has come.
you must continue yourjourney without me.
what are you...? Wait!
master!
you can't leave me!
you must believe.
master!
yeah so I'm like "Fine you may be a wolf you may be the scariest bandit in Haijin Province..."
...but you're a lousy tipper.
Really? So how did you get out of there alive?
I mean I didn't actually say that...
...but I thought it...
...in my mind.
if he could read my mind he'd be like What?
order up! Hope you like it.
this is really good! - No come on.
try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup. He actually knows the secret ingredient.
what do you mean? This is amazing!
you're a really good cook. - I wish my mouth was bigger.
Tigress you've got to try this.
it is said that the Dragon Warrior can survive for months on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf and the energy of the universe.
I guess my body doesn't know it's the Dragon Warrior yet.
I'm gonna need a lot more than dew and universe juice.
what? - Nothing... Master Shifu.
never be the Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!
what is that noise you're making? Laughter? I never heard of it!
work hard panda and maybe someday...
...you will have ears like mine.
that's good.
ears. It's not working for you? I thought they were pretty good.
it's Shifu!
of course it's Shifu. What do you think I'm doing?
master Shifu!
you think this is funny?
Tai Lung has escaped and you're acting like children!
what? - He is coming for the Dragon Scroll and you are the only one who can stop him.
and I was saying you got no sense of humor.
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.
what? You're serious? And I have to...?
master Oogway will stop him like he did before.
Oogway cannot!
not anymore.
our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.
the panda? - Yes the panda!
master let us stop Tai Lung. This is what you've trained us for.
No! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung.
it is his!
Where'd he go?
you cannot leave! A real warrior never quits.
watch me.
come on.
how am I supposed to beat Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to the stairs.
you will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior.
you don't believe that. You never believed that.
from the beginning you've tried to get rid of me.
Yes! I was.
but now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine.
you're not my master. And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
then why didn't you quit?! You knew I wanted you gone yet you stayed.
yeah I stayed.
I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled it hurt but it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just being me.
I stayed because I thought if anyone could change me...
...could make me... not me...
...it was you.
the greatest kung fu teacher in all of China!
but I can change you!
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior! And I will!
come on. Tai Lung is on his way here right now.
even if it takes him a hundred years to get here how are you...
...gonna change this into the Dragon Warrior?
how?
how?
how?! - I don't know!
I don't know.
that's what I thought.
this is what you trained me for.
Tigress!
don't try and stop me.
we're not trying to stop you.
what?
we're coming with you!
what? I eat when I'm upset OK?
no need to eXplain.
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides his almond cookies on the top shelf.
don't tell Monkey.
look at you. - Yeah I know I disgust you.
no I mean how did you get up there?
I don't know. I guess that...
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.
yet you are ten feet off the ground.
and you have done a perfect spilt.
no this? This is just...
...an accident.
there are no accidents.
come with me.
I know you're trying to be all mystical and kung fuey...
...but could you at least tell me where we're going?
you dragged me...
...all the way out here...
...for a bath?
Panda...
...we do not wash our pits in the Pool of Sacred Tears.
the Pool of...
this is where Oogway unraveled the mysteries...
...of harmony and focus.
this is the birthplace...
...of kung fu.
do you want to learn kung fu?
Yeah!
then I am your master!
OK!
don't cry.
OK.
when you focus on kung fu when you concentrate...
...you stink.
perhaps that is my fault.
I cannot train you the way I have trained the Five.
I now see that the way to get through to you...
...is with this.
Oh great 'cause I am hungry.
good.
when you have been trained you may eat.
let us begin.
after you panda.
just like that?
no sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?
I vowed to train you and you have been trained. You are free to eat.
enjoy.
Hey!
I said you are free to eat. Have a dumpling.
Hey!
you are free to eat.
am I?! - Are you?!
I'm not hungry.
master.
cut it!
Where's the Dragon Warrior?
how do you know you're not looking at her?
you think I'm a fool?
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior. None of you!
I heard how he fell out of the sky in a ball of fire.
that he's a warrior unlike anything the world has ever seen.
Po? - So that is his name. Po.
finally a worthy opponent.
our battle will be legendary!
we've got this. Help her.
monkey!
go!
what was I thinking?!
Mantis!
now!
Shifu taught you well.
but he didn't teach you everything.
you have done well panda.
done well? Done well?
I've done awesome!
the mark of a true hero is humility.
but yes you have done...
...awesome.
guys? Guys?! They're dead!
no they're breathing. They're asleep? But their eyes are open.
we were no match for his nerve attach.
he's gotten stronger.
who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
he's too fast!
sorry Po.
I thought we could stop him.
he could have killed you.
why didn't he?
so you could come back and strike fear into our hearts. But it won't work.
it might. I mean a little.
I'm pretty scared.
you can defeat him panda!
are you kidding? If they can't?!
they're five masters. I'm just one me.
but you will have the one thing that no one else does.
you really believe I'm ready?
you are...
...Po.
behold the Dragon Scroll.
it is yours.
wait. What happens when I read it?
legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat.
Really? That's cool.
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.
you will feel the universe in motion around you.
can I punch through walls?
do a quadruple back flip? - Focus.
will I...? - Focus.
focus. - Oh yeah yeah.
read it Po and fulfill your destiny.
read it and become...
...the Dragon Warrior.
it's impossible to open.
OK. Come on baby. Come on now.
thank you.
I probably loosened it up for you though.
OK here goes.
it's blank. - What?!
here look. - No I am forbidden to look upon...
blank. I don't...
I don't understand.
OK. So like...
...Oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all.
no. Oogway was wiser than us all.
Oh come on! Face it he picked me by accident.
of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
but who will stop Tai Lung?
he'll destroy everything and everyone.
no.
evacuate the valley. You must protect the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.
what about you Master? - I will fight him.
what? - I can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.
but Shifu he'll kill you.
then I will finally have paid for my mistake.
listen to me all of you.
it is time for you to continue yourjourney without me.
I am very proud to have been your master.
we've got to get them out safely.
come little one. Let's find your mama.
viper gather the southern farmers. Mantis the north.
Orane light the way.
look it's the Dragon Warrior.
hey Dad.
Po!
good to have you back son.
good to be back.
let's go Po.
so for our next shop it's time to face it...
...the future of noodles is dice-cut vegetables...
...no longer slices.
also I was thinking maybe this time we'll have a kitchen you can actually stand up in.
you like that?
Po I'm sorry if things didn't work out.
itjust wasn't meant to be.
Po forget everything else.
your destiny still awaits.
we are noodle folk. Broth runs deep through our veins.
I don't know Dad.
honestly sometimes I can't believe I'm actually your son.
Po...
...I think it's time I told you something I should have told you...
...a long time ago.
OK.
the secret ingredient of my Secret Ingredient Soup.
come here. The secret ingredient is...
...nothing.
you heard me. Nothing!
there is no secret ingredient!
wait wait. It's just plain old noodle soup?
you don't add some kind of special sauce or something?
don't have to. To make something special you just believe it's special.
there is no secret ingredient.
I have come home Master.
this is no longer your home. And I am no longer your master.
Oh yes. You have a new favorite.
so where is this Po?
did I scare him off?
this battle is between you and me.
so that is how it's going to be.
that is how it must be.
I rotted in jail for 20 years because of your weakness!
obeying your master is not weakness!
you knew I was the Dragon Warrior.
you always knew.
but when Oogway said otherwise what did you do?
what did you do?!
nothing!
you were not meant to be the Dragon Warrior! That was not my fault!
not your fault?!
who filled my head with dreams?!
who drove me to train until my bones cracked?!
who denied me my destiny?!
it was never my decision to make!
it is now.
give me the scroll!
I would rather die.
all I ever did I did to make you proud!
tell me how proud you are Shifu!
tell me!
tell me!
I have... I have always been proud of you.
from the first moment I've been...
...proud of you.
and it was my pride...
...that blinded me.
I loved you too much to see what you were becoming...
...what I...
...was turning you into.
I'm...
I'm sorry.
I don't want your apology.
I want my scroll!
What?!
where is it?!
dragon Warrior has taken the scroll halfway across China by now.
you will never see that scroll Tai Lung.
never.
never.
stairs.
who are you?
buddy I am the Dragon Warrior.
you?
him? He's a panda.
you're a panda. What are you gonna do big guy? Sit on me?
don't tempt me.
no. I'm gonna use this.
you want it? Come and get it.
Finally!
that scroll is mine!
lightning!
the scroll has given him power!
No!
Finally! Oh yes.
the power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!
it's nothing!
it's OK. I didn't get it the first time either.
what?
there is no secret ingredient.
it's just you.
stop it!
I'm gonna pee.
don't.
don't! Don't!
you...
...can't defeat me.
you...
...you're just a big...
...fat...
...panda!
I'm not a big fat panda.
I'm the big fat panda.
the WuXi Finger Hold!
Oh you know this hold?
you're bluffing. You're bluffing. Shifu didn't teach you that.
Nope.
I figured it out. Skadoosh.
look!
the Dragon Warrior.
that's my boy! That big lovely kung fu warrior is my son!
Yes!
thanks Dad.
hey guys.
master.
master.
master?
master Shifu!
master!
Shifu are you OK?!
Po.
you're alive.
or we're both dead.
no Master I didn't die. I defeated Tai Lung.
you did?
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.
you are the Dragon Warrior.
you have brought peace...
...to this valley...
...and...
...and to me.
thank you.
thank you Po.
thank you. Thank you.
No! Master! No no no don't die Shifu please!
I'm not dying you idiot!
dragon Warrior...
...I am simply at peace. Finally.
so I should stop talking?
if you can.
want to get something to eat?
Yeah.
the distant future...
vampires rule the night, but their numbers are dwindling.
with huge bounties on their heads, a class of hunters has emerged, Bounty Hunters.
one hunter is unlike all the others. He is a Dunpeal; a half human half vampire.
at war with himself, feared by all, tortured and alone, he is...
it's not easy to ask him for this but it's something that must be done.
I'm sorry.
do you understand?
I understand your position, but ... ten million dollars is not enough.
what?
how dare you!
stop it, hold your fire!
I said stop!
I'll double the price.
I'll give you twenty million.
just bring her back one way or the other.
did you see a carriage go by here with four horses in front?
let me go, let me go
you're lying.
Oh, damn; we got company.
lots a company.
look out!
Oh, man. Is everybody OK?
Yeah.
do you believe that?
the place is overrun with them.
he must have been here already.
well, c'mon ready or not, here they come
it's zombie time.
Yeah, come and get it, zombies!
Amen to that.
Leila, are you there?
it won't take long, Grove.
Just...stay in the tank.
can't load!
not so fast, buddy.
and fire!
gotcha!
rest in peace, huh?
you hear that?
sounds like a horse.
it's moving...uphill
let me try.
right ...
right about ...
right there!
beautiful, just beautiful.
I applaud you, stranger.
tell me what you're doing here.
if we're in the same game, we should be friends.
tell me your name.
mine's Borgoff, Borgoff Markus.
Ah, so that's the guy, the dhampir hunter.
I've heard about him.
he's amazing.
wake up, Borgoff, he's the competition, not some buddy of ours.
C'mon, what are we doing here, we just helped him, think about it.
Yeah, he's right, I agree with him about that.
we help him too much and he'll take all the money.
if it wasn't for us, he'd be dead by now.
we do the work and he gets the reward.
Ah, you boys should relax.
we just did the famous dhampir a little favor is all.
a little favor we can't afford.
hey y'ever hear the one about the owl and squirrel?
squirrel works all summer storin' away stuff for the winter, all kinds of nuts and seeds works real hard.
then one day just before the first snow he goes outside for one last look around when all of a sudden this owl swoops down and grabs him, carries him off.
Ah, what a shame," says the squirrel " 'cause what's gonna happen to all that good food?"
Aw, that's a good one.
Yeah, hilarious.
you get it, you guys?
that stupid squirrel is all I can
Leila!
Hey, Leila, what's the rush?
what's with her?
so you're outnumbered, four to one; so what?
they do have a head start, but when the sun comes up, the heat will slow 'em down.
speaking of, ah, sun and heat, I know I don't need to remind you of your susceptibility.
it's called heat syndrome...
and the last time you ignored it, you almost
don't worry.
I hate it when you say that.
what...what are those ?
tracks let me see
Yes, oK! These are definitely that tracks, six hours old I'd say
OK.
I'm suffocating now.
Hey, how was that?
that's funny
I could have sworn I heard something.
quiet.
sand mantas, most likely.
sweet blasphemy, sand mantas galore!
they're filthy animals, y'know, they're just filthy!
well, I--I guess we better just turn back, it's a shame, really, 'cause you know, we could
no -- go back, man go back, now, c'mon you're crazy, c'mon, man -- please, let's' just go back
that -- that was good
OK, now, we survived that, could we stop?
did...did you ever hear the expression "too close for comfort"?
that--that was damn uncomfortable.
what is it ? a resting house?
I didn't think anybody had those any more.
they must be in there.
wow, it blends in nicely.
OK...oh, here we are.
I -- I see 'em.
how many are there?
Two...I think.
a man ... and a woman.
look out for the exit door.
no door ...
no door there ...
still no door...
no ...
are you sure ... about that door?
no ... no ...
what was that?
she's out of her mind!
door! Door!
you're dead!
I'm here for the young woman.
I wouldn't recommend it, dhampir.
taking on a vampire at night is a mission for morons and fools.
which are you?
she's here by her own choice, dhampir.
so unless you're the kind of man who would take a woman against her will for the money in it and I'm sure it's a lot
I would if I could believe you, Meier.
your credibility, however, is less than impeccable under the circumstances.
you kidnapped the girl.
Meier!
Oh, my nose, my nose!
what happened ?
what'd...what'd I miss?
she called out his name.
it may be true, what he said.
no, she's just ignorant she's a child.
she doesn't know him yet.
she doesn't know what he's capable of.
that poor girl she's...she's bleeding pretty bad.
I mean, she won't last long.
it's a shame really -- to waste all that good blood
I mean -- come on, admit it -- you're tempted.
I mean, I know you are!
M...Mother...
wait, I was just kidding, y'know.
C'mon, let's go.
we got work to do...
the money, c'mon; think of the money!
Hey, what did you do to me?
I bound your wound and stopped your bleeding. That's all.
Oh, I get it.
you think you can just go ahead and tear off the clothes of whoever you come across.
that's what you think, isn't it, dhampir.
you should go back home and nurse your wounds.
what are you, my mother?
you called out for your mother before
I thought you might be needing her.
hey
I see her.
when the last vampire is extinct, who will mourn our passing?
will she? will anyone?
can anyone understand this pain, this loneliness?
I told you so, didn't I?
I said, leave the girl alone she's trouble she's competition, y'know.
you aided and abetted the enemy.
I hope this is the right way.
trust me, I know how they think, these vampires.
when they're threatened, they all head for Barbarois.
they're so predictable.
barbarois, yeah
and I really hate that place.
it's full of lunatics and monsters, and that old crazy man, y'know.
does it hurt very much, Leila?
Leila?
huh?
your injury...does it hurt you?
Oh, no, it's fine.
I...
grove, you should lie down, you look tired.
you need to rest...don't worry about me.
Leila...
who dressed the wound? Was it him?
you can tell me.
it was him, wasn't it? The dhampir hunter.
Leila, I'm warning you he...he's trouble. He's against us.
I don't know why he did that.
grove, please don't tell anyone, oK?
he stopped there but what for?
let's find out.
nolt and Kyle, you come with me
Leila, you stay in here with Grove.
OK...is everybody ready?
always.
ready.
Yeah.
Hey, Nolt, see what's goin' on in there, willya?
it may be a trap.
Yeah, we'll cover you.
it'll be my pleasure, gentlemen
it's nothin' but a lousy piece of cloth.
what the hell ?
Bastard...unbelievable!
Hey...watch out!
so...
you dare to enter Barbarois
I assume it's arrogance and vast stupidity that brings you here, gentlemen or perhaps it's ignorance.
you're skillful hunters, I can see but you're no match for the Barbarois.
five thousand years of isolation have made us invincible!
huh?
what?
