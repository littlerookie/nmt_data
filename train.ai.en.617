wilber argues at length that this perspective is not antiecological, as it might appear at first glance.
wilber begins by drawing attention to our ecological crises.
wilber focuses on christianity, but similar confusion and ambivalence toward mysticism seem characteristic of other traditions which fix final authority in a historical text and are therefore embarrassed by breakthroughs of new mystical insights.
wilber pays particular attention to the evolution of gender relations and the human relationship to the environment at each historical stage.
wilber suggests that the great sigmund freud represents a paradigmatic example of this divorce of eros and agape.
wilber suggests that this self-transcendent drive is beginning to move increasing numbers of people beyond the conventional developmental level of rationality into transrational, transpersonal stages.
wilber uses the maps devised by cognitive developmental psychologists, such as jean piaget, to trace the psychological development of individuals--which he ties to social and cultural evolution from early hominids up to present society.
wilber wants to expand this view.
wilber was my son.
wilber, however, points to the power of a culture's techno-economic base in determining its social hierarchy, and argues that there is no guarantee that future technologies will necessarily foster equality, a concern which seems to have been largely overlooked by feminists.
wilberforce was a great british social reformer who fought for the abolition of the slave trade in the late 18th and early 19th century.
