but it also speaks about action.
but it also speaks to a wider breakdown of understanding between press and politicians.
but it also spells out, in its four-letter code of as, ts, gs, and cs, our direct relationship to the myriad of other living organisms on the planet everything from siberian tigers to mould.

but it hardly changes the nature of our collaboration.
but it hardly counts as the "big bazooka" investors want, if only because the banks are wary of taking losses on ever larger stashes of government debt.

but it has a mystical significance.
but it has a nitrogen - rich atmosphere which produces hydrocarbons...
but it has a point of view,
but it has a powerful demonstration effect.
but it has a powerful organising idea: take the latest technology, package it in a simple, elegant form and sell it at a premium price.
but it has a robust process for dealing with these centred on the committee on foreign investment in the united states, which vets deals that could compromise national security.
but it has a shape.
but it has a special design feature
but it has a terrible appetite.
but it has a very practical purpose,
but it has a very useful purpose. These jagged edges of the gear
but it has a weak spot
but it has adapted deftly to the evolving demand, now publishing about 150 titles a year, 70 percent of which come from outside mainland china.
but it has all gone horribly wrong.
but it has all the drama of the 7th game of the world series!
but it has all the essentials.
but it has already been paid.
but it has already defaulted on the expectations and dreams of many of its citizens.
but it has already had a wider impact, mainly in schools in america.
but it has already made customers think about computing in more economic terms, by asking what a given job is worth to them.

but it has also backfired.
but it has also become a thriving executive-jet centre.
but it has also become popular with vineyards in the rest of the world, including several in california.
but it has also brought risks.
but it has also chosen obfuscation over transparency in talking about the effects of these measures, just as it has manipulated statistics to make it look as if air quality has improved in recent years when in fact it has deteriorated.
but it has also contributed to the clean-up of abandoned rusty cars, farm machinery and disused construction materials as scrap dealers scoured the land for metal.
but it has also covered the government's stated intention of giving new weight to china's own culture, and the relative merits of observing traditional holidays rather than socialism's sacred labour day.
but it has also encouraged the growth of a market in women: poor peasant girls, kidnapped or lured from their homes by brokers, may be transported to distant provinces and sold as wives to men unable to find brides.
but it has also encouraged unscrupulous and frivolous litigants, and a legal industry that caters to them.
but it has also failed to return the country to solvency.
but it has also hugely exacerbated the inequalities between town and country and between china's prosperous seaboard and its hungry hinterland.
but it has also increased student-teacher ratios and eliminated some academic programs, like industrial engineering and dance, even as enrollment has surged.

but it has also made concessions, reducing the duration of the loathed military service, releasing the teenagers and announcing an investigation.
but it has also made redundant workers more expendable, and labor hoarding a thing of the past.
but it has also produced a ruling class increasingly remote from an increasingly bitter people.
but it has also shown me what is precious.
but it has also slowly but surely drained the groundwater.
but it has also started flexing its muscles to protect the key sea lanes further away that are the lifeblood of its economy, and which, incidentally, the u. s.has protected for almost 70 years.
but it has also started to call for more investment to support the economy, opening the door for growth-hungry local governments to unveil ambitious spending targets.
but it has also tackled its industry publicity problem more strategically, in a way that even more explicitly emphasizes the "google" component of "google news": it has ingratiated itself to the news industry iteratively, experimentally, and incrementally.
but it has also taken advantage of the "lite-sport" aircraft category introduced by america's federal aviation administration (faa) in 2004.
but it has also weighed down morgan stanley.

but it has been badly battered by falling demand for new office space during the past 18 months.
but it has been cold-shouldered by most scientists. Funding has dried up. What research there is, is conducted outside mainstream laboratories.
but it has been consistently delayed amid fears from those downstream that the dam would give punjab, pakistan's richest and most politically powerful province, an inordinate amount of control over the country's water resources.
but it has been declining against the euro.
but it has been disappointing in that the kind of genetic variation it detects has turned out to explain surprisingly little of the genetic links to most diseases.
but it has been disproved by events even more thoroughly than most of us expected.
but it has been easier than I thought.
but it has been eight months. Don't you think we need closure?
but it has been enormously successful at identifying previously unknown individual genes.

but it has been interpreted to mean that they must abide by every footling wildlife regulation on earth.
but it has been known to Tibetans for hundreds of years.
but it has been luckier than vesta-and almost every other asteroid-in avoiding collisions, and has thus not yielded a huge crop of meteorites for earth-bound scientists to examine.

but it has come to be an all-purpose label for a highly stylized and carefully choreographed manner of dealing with violence and physical action, everything from various kinds of martial arts to swordplay and gun battles.
but it has come to stand for much more than the average, slow-gestating technical standard.
but it has come under a rare spotlight since the world bank approved a loan worth$ 3.75 billion to south africa's state electricity utility, eskom, to be used mainly towards completing the vast medupi power station in the northern limpopo province.

but it has not doused a storm of criticism of the three gorges dam upriver, including allegations that it contributed to the disaster.

but it is also necessary to understand these problems holistically-to comprehend the systematic interrelationships that actions on one set of issues may have on other pertinent institutional investor problems.
but it is also non-negotiable.
but it is also partly because of falling demand for chinese goods from america, europe and the middle east, which has given china's manufacturers and local government a big incentive to work around the country's formidable export-promotion policies and to sell at home.
but it is also plain that the jobs mess is not just about demand: it cannot be solved with more stimulus alone.
but it is also politically unacceptable for trade-deficit countries, especially in the developed west, to accept the high unemployment consistent with leakage of demand to trade-surplus countries.

but it is also working to develop aircraft domestically.
but it is also worth acknowledging that these bumptious new economic powers have made the world more complicated for western policymakers.
