tottenham embark on the new season when manchester city visit on saturday at the identical juncture to chelsea when they claimed the first of their three premier league titles in 2004-5: 49 long years have passed since bill nicholson's legendary double winners last brought the championship to white hart lane.
tottenham finally managed a last-minute equaliser, after constant pressure throughout the majority of the game.
tottenham had beaten united earlier in the season following a fine display of direct dribbling and while vertonghen and mousa dembele had contributed to that, bale was clearly the man ferguson wanted to stop.

tottenham have not won any of their past 21 top-flight games against united, drawing five and losing 16 times they have also failed to score in 13 of those 21 games
tottenham have played the most attractive brand of football the premier league has seen this season, but their array of free-flowing attack-minded football has also come at a cost.
tottenham hotspur are also rumoured to be interested in the former portsmouth and udinese workhorse.
tottenham hotspur captain ledley king is recalled while leighton baines and ben foster are included along with west ham united forward carlton cole who made his england debut last month in seville.
tottenham hotspur lead chelsea on goal difference, with both clubs having won their first three matches, while arsenal are third, having won two out of two.

touch in the nicu: promoting infant well-being and family relationships.
touch is a form of redundancy, enfolding more sensory information into what we see and therefore what we read. It makes the words on the page richer in meaning and more multidimensional. It gives words a geometry.
touch is healing and extremely nourishing to your body.
touch is one of the most important ways for mankind to know about the environment, virtual reality will be depressed in immersion and imagination without touch feedback, and a vr merely including video and audibility is far from a perfect one.
touch is the most self-reflexive of senses, an insight affirmed by the german researcher david katz, who established the field of touch studies in the early 20th century based on his work with world war I amputees.
