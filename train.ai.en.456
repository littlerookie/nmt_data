timperley had, not surprisingly, developed close professional links with officials in the nationalist government during his work in china.
timperley helped to set up a neutral "safety zone" in shanghai with the support of local japanese friends, which provided refuge for thousands of chinese.
timperley is accused of creating a "massacre myth" in a new book by a japanese historian, kitamura minoru, who claims that he was an "agent of the chinese kuomintang"-the nationalist party then in government.
timperley left journalism to become an adviser to the chinese ministry of information in 1939, but continued to be consulted by the editor of the guardian, wp crozier.
timperley's book, far from being "commissioned" by the chinese intelligence service, as some japanese scholars now insinuate, was prompted by members of the "international committee" of foreigners in nanjing.
