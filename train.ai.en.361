hung-chien and hsin-mei dutifully remarked on how nice and well-fed the baby was and discussed whether he resembled his mother or his father.
hung-chien and jou-chia conversed politely with mrs. chao, and when hsin-mei came back in, they rose to say goodbye.
hung-chien and miss sun, neither of whom had slept the rest of the night, also rose and went outside for a breath of fresh air.
hung-chien asked him what he was inspecting.
hung-chien asked sheepishly, "could n't you add a bank p'o?
hung-chien asked who the playwrights were.
hung-chien browsed around for a long time, then to his surprise found a chinese translation of art outline of logic. He checked it out and went back to his room, as happy as t'ang san-tsang returning to ch'angan with the sutras.
hung-chien chuckled to himself over her lies and asked her the whereabouts of mr. shen.
hung-chien collapsed weakly into his chair. He felt cold and hot all over as though stricken with malaria.
hung-chien could not help defending his father, "he wasn't asking you to be a maidservant, merely urging you not to go out and work."
hung-chien could not help remarking, "I had my fortune told, too. My luck has been terrible this year. Aren't you all afraid of getting involved in my bad luck?"
hung-chien could only declare for the second time that he had not received the letter, feeling at the same time that his demotion to associate professor was already a blessing from above.
hung-chien couldn't help exclaiming, "bravo, bravo!"
hung-chien did n't understand. Ah ch'ou said, "did you have' 'relations'with eldest aunt at school
hung-chien felt as if her abuse had given him a heavy slap on his ear and in self-defense, he hung up the receiver. Miss su's voice continued to jar his consciousness.
hung-chien felt even more uncomfortable.
hung-chien felt in the end that her accent was not genuine. He himself had never been to america, but if chao hsin-mei were there, he could have detected it. Maybe she had immigrated to new york.
hung-chien felt it was a bad omen. They'd never get the money, and it would drag on and on uncertainly, while they were helpless to do anything about it. It was like running into a revolving door and having nothing to push against.
hung-chien felt rather nervous when he saw her, and his hands were continuously toying with the four-colored supernorma pencil on his desk which he had brought back from germany.
hung-chien followed him. Just as they had rounded the corner, miss sun rose from a bench to greet them.
hung-chien got gloomily into the car.
hung-chien got on rather well with mr. wang, so when he heard all these rumors, he went to ask him about them, and while he was there he showed him hsin-mei's letter.
hung-chien had had a cold for the last couple of days and his throat was filled with phlegm.
hung-chien had never expected miss su to call, and he was sure mrs. chou would quiz him about the call. As he bounded up the stairs to answer the phone, he heard hsiao-ch'eng remark in a loud voice, "I bet it's su wen-wan.
hung-chien had never studied logic before and had no reference books handy. Though he worked hard at preparing, he found no interest in it, and the students in his class were there for the credits only.
hung-chien had never thought that other people already knew about his case. Coloring slightly, he said, "my case was nothing special, but, mr. kao-i guess I learned a lesson."
hung-chien had not gone to bed yet.
hung-chien handed the child back, and while no one was watching, pulled out his handkerchief and wiped the already dried saliva from his face.
hung-chien hissed at him, and he ran off laughing.
hung-chien hurried down to meet his father and brought an old-fashioned pendulum wall clock into the room.
hung-chien ignored her. Jou-chia threw him a glance, but it didn't penetrate the newspaper. She then turned and left.
hung-chien is saving me from having to take out my pocketbook, so how can I not be pleased?
hung-chien knew he had spoken too harshly and inwardly regretted it, but for the moment he was not willing to give in.
hung-chien knew once he got his hands on the pencil it was condemned to death by decapitation and refused to give it to him.
hung-chien knew she was somewhat hostile toward hsin-mei, and so he ignored what she said.
hung-chien knew this was the lull before the storm.
hung-chien laughed at her for being such a sourpuss.
hung-chien limply implored miss su not to see him home.
hung-chien looked pleadingly at miss sun and said, "you really don't need me to keep you company?"
hung-chien merely said that hsin-mei had received an urgent telegram from home and that someone was ill.
hung-chien merely said, "I'm not worthy. I wouldn't dare aspire to it."
hung-chien noticed immediately that the french policeman was the one who had been on the same ship coming to shanghai with him. They had spoken a few times on the ship, and the frenchman still seemed to recognize hung-chien, for he waved hung-chien's rickshaw through.
hung-chien observed, "chicken and duck gizzards are never used in western dishes. In london I saw whole boxes of chicken and duck gizzards selling so cheaply they hardly cost anything. People bought them to feed their cats."
hung-chien only hoped he could conceal his scar in the dark recesses of his mind, like the infected eyes which shun the light or the torn flesh which fears the wind.
hung-chien pressed hsin-mei's shoulder in amazement and asked him why.
hung-chien quickly went out of his way to assure her how much he valued friendship.
hung-chien read all afternoon with deep interest, greatly broadening his knowledge. He learned that the chinese were square and honest by nature, so they said the sky was square. Foreigners were roundabout and cunning and therefore maintained that the earth was round;
hung-chien remarked that he had n't seen her since returning from kweilin and asked her how she had been spending her winter vacation.
hung-chien replied emphatically that he could not write poetry.
hung-chien replied that it would be at least half an hour.
hung-chien replied that when mama chang or mama sun had straightened up the room, he'd send one of them out to buy some, but now they were not to make a fuss. Whoever did would lose his popsicle.
hung-chien replied with a grating, scornful laugh and asked if his employment was terminated as of that day.
hung-chien returned to the rickshaw and dozed off from exhaustion. He was suddenly roused by a disturbance; gazing out wide-eyed, he saw a white path of light lying on the ground and heard li screaming.
hung-chien said it was just an occasion for everyone to get acquainted, and there was no special etiquette. His father just wanted them to pay respects to their ancestors.
hung-chien said resolutely, "I'll finish this one, but beyond that I won't touch another drop even if you kill me."
hung-chien said with a laugh, "I'm afraid I'll faint, too, so I'm not going up either," and he told the errand boy to run up, open the windows, and bring down the books.
hung-chien said, "I've already given it up, and miss sun doesn't smoke at all."
hung-chien said, "you were always telling me how smart your former teacher kao was. Now that I've come and seen him in action, I don't find him so brilliant at all."
hung-chien spitefully refused to eat them, but his greediness won out, and he ate them anyway, all the while cursing himself for being unable to do any better.
hung-chien spouted some nonsense to cover up, then showed his father the telegram.
hung-chien stared after him in astonishment.
hung-chien stayed a little longer; with no one in the mood for more conversation, he said goodbye and left before anyone else. Miss su did not try to keep him.
hung-chien suddenly felt that in this family atmosphere the war was something unbelievable, just as no one can think of ghosts in broad daylight.
hung-chien suddenly had the alarming suspicion that miss su was either a big idiot or a superb liar.
hung-chien suddenly realized that as he was leaving the teahouse, he had put on feng-i's gown by mistake. Both gowns belonged to feng-i and were of identical color and material.
hung-chien suggested that for their return trip, instead of taking the old route back, they should simply fly straight from kweilin to hong kong and avoid all the hardships. They could ask hsin-mei to help them get plane tickets.
hung-chien then realized he'd left her all alone for too long and hurried back to the hotel.
hung-chien thought to himself that those policemen on the boat were all from the french countryside and were leaving home for the first time, and everyone of them was pitifully poor.
hung-chien thought to himself, why do charming girls all have fathers?
hung-chien took some spare coins from the general funds to buy some unshelled peanuts for their breakfast. Hsin-mei warned him not to eat anything on the sly.
hung-chien walked on a few paces and then caught a whiff of the fragrant smell of roasted sweet potatoes. He breathed in as though quenching a powerful thirst, and his hunger immediately constricted his stomach even tighter.
hung-chien was about to get hsin-mei, but she said she had just come from hsin-mei's place, that the professors in the political science department were holding a conference there, and the room was filled with smoke. When she saw that they were all busy, she did not sit down.
hung-chien was alarmed, thinking it must have been his mother who had come over to admonish her. He had kept from her everything his mother had said last time. "Who?" He asked quickly.
hung-chien was already peeved at seeing him this way, and these last few remarks were more than he could take.
hung-chien was both startled and amused, thinking, it's been like that since ancient times. Mrs. shen shouldn't have to attend a women's conference now to find that out.
hung-chien was crowded up in front close to the bus driver, sitting on his small suitcase.
hung-chien was extremely tired and sleepy, but his mind would not settle down. Sleep gathered in on all sides but did not close up, like two halves of a window curtain that are about to join when suddenly the cord becomes stuck, letting through a thread of the outside world.
hung-chien was of a mind with dr. johnson of england in not distinguishing between the rank of a louse and a flea.
hung-chien was so astonished that he could not suppress a cry.
hung-chien was thinking, governments may be able to move their capitals, but I can't change my seat.
hung-chien was worried lest he get appendicitis.
hung-chien watched her crying piteously, but he would not pity her and only hated her all the more.
hung-chien went to the library to look for books. The library had fewer than one thousand books, most of which were old, battered, torn textbooks of chinese, relics of schools that had been suspended during the war.
hung-chien went with his wife to the suns first. Since the taxi was waiting and each second was being counted, his courtesy call to his in-laws was brief to the extreme.
hung-chien went with hsin-mei and there they saw ku, who was waving his arms and stamping his feet to call them down.
hung-chien wished he could have told her that it was quite enough if she'd just talk with her mouth and be careful not to twist herself in two.
hung-chien's emotions were like a whirlpool.
hung-chien's face flushed as red as a sick man with a temperature of one hundred three degrees.
hung-chien's heart gave such a heavy thump that it sounded like a package hitting the ground when cargo is being unloaded from a truck. He wondered how hsin-mei could not have heard it.
hung-chien's heart jumped with fright, but he could not bring his feet to a halt. The two students were completely still.
hung-chien's heart sank irretrievably. He mechanically took the key and thanked her.
hung-chien's lament over the pekingese was partly true.
hung-chien's not in. I'll have him call you when he gets back.
Hung-ehien said with a laugh, "what a good' uncle'he is!
