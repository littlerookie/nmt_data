I mean, it was my idea, remember? To appeal to the female demo.
I mean, it was my tip
I mean, it was nice of you to set it up and all. Thank you.
I mean, it was nice, but...
I mean, it was nighttime, so the kid probably -
I mean, it was no secret.
I mean, it was not that long ago that your wife left you.
I mean, it was nothing too kinky...
I mean, it was obvious how bad he wanted it.

I mean, it was original at least.
I mean, it was out of my control.

I mean, it was so obvious that she wasn't herself.
I mean, it was so simple,
I mean, it was so specific. No, it wasn't.
I mean, it was still me. - That is so sweet.
I mean, it was still too hot for me to even go near Vegas.
I mean, it was such a great day.
I mean, it was supposed to be me there, right?
I mean, it was supposed to happen, it was supposed to happen,
I mean, it was terrible and all - what, exciting at the same time?
I mean, it was the love potion talking.
I mean, it was the magazine, well, the mayor thought it would be good press.
I mean, it was the most shattering blow anyone could ever have inflicted on her.
I mean, it was the night before your wedding.
I mean, it was the same... Chemistry, the same connection.
I mean, it was the very last tally... Is from a place called defiance.
I mean, it was there when I went to bed.
I mean, it was there, and then it wasn't.
I mean, it was till I was dishonorably discharged for some bullshit.
I mean, it was too tight and I couldn't breathe, but...
I mean, it was totally humiIiating, too, 'cause they waIked in on me,
I mean, it was tough there for a while, supporting a family...
I mean, it was tough. I was nervous going into it honestly.
I mean, it was toying with me, it was
I mean, it was uncanny.
I mean, it was very chaotic the night we brought him in.
I mean, it was very hard to vote you guys out.
I mean, it was visual, it was captivating,
I mean, it was weird. Like all the game had vanished.
I mean, it was well - planned, well - executed,
I mean, it was what it was.
I mean, it was when I started,
I mean, it was when she was here with her boyfriend three hours ago.
I mean, it was worth every cent to see the last of that guy.
I mean, it was worth it though.
I mean, it was wrong of me to think you'd be stupid
I mean, it was years ago.
I mean, it was your first time.
I mean, it was your first time.
I mean, it was your gun.
I mean, it was your idea to meet the press after the big win.
I mean, it was your idea to meet the press after the big win.
I mean, it was' 02.
I mean, it was, it was -
I mean, it was, uh...
I mean, it was.
I mean, it was... I had a...
I mean, it was... It was all perfect. And then things took a bit of a turn for the worse.
I mean, it was... Just a kiss.
I mean, it was... Like making love with a wild animal.
I mean, it was... My pleasure.
I mean, it was... Stupid and - and too late, anyway.
I mean, it was... The industry was getting pretty stale, you know.
I mean, it was... The only way that I could get anyone to come look for my dad.
I mean, it was... You remember I mentioned it just kind of eased out.
I mean, it wasn't "bad" weird. You know?
I mean, it wasn't 'the notebook,
I mean, it wasn't awful, by any means. But it just wasn't special,
I mean, it wasn't better than that cheer leading outfit, but...
I mean, it wasn't creepy or nothing, you know.
I mean, it wasn't exactly a date, but...
I mean, it wasn't keystone Kops, like I tripped and the gun went off or nothing.
I mean, it wasn't like I was wasted or anything,
I mean, it wasn't like I was wasted or anything,
I mean, it wasn't like you could bring them home as pets or...

I mean, it wasn't really a fight, it was just...
I mean, it wasn't really a fight, it was just....
I mean, it wasn't something he bragged about.
I mean, it wasn't supposed to be like this.
I mean, it wasn't that big of a deal.
I mean, it wasn't that kind of kiss.
I mean, it wasn't that long ago
I mean, it wasn't too weird,
I mean, it wasn't until I read your poem...
I mean, it went from, "Rita's everything
I mean, it will be once we get inside, of course.
I mean, it will be splendid enough?
I mean, it will help... The restaurant.
I mean, it will take them some time to adapt,
I mean, it won't kill you, but it delivers enough hurt.
I mean, it won't kill you, but it delivers enough hurt.
I mean, it won't kill you.
I mean, it won't kill you.
I mean, it worked for me.
I mean, it worked great with these two. Whenever they'd throw fits,
I mean, it worked out now,
I mean, it worked this time, but it's a dangerous game.
I mean, it worked.
I mean, it works for you and mom. Oh, thanks.
I mean, it works.
I mean, it works. My technologyi - is the vanguard.
I mean, it would actually be funny if it wasn't so just... Not funny.
I mean, it would be a big change in your life.
I mean, it would be a terrific waste of manpower,
I mean, it would be an amazing gift if you guys both went.
I mean, it would be an amazing gift if you guys both went.
I mean, it would be different if they were reled.
I mean, it would be difficult for us with our equipment to get
I mean, it would be easy to check his handwriting.
I mean, it would be great if you got a job.
I mean, it would be if he were black, but he's not. That's just the reality.
I mean, it would be just like the first time, you know,
I mean, it would be kind of nice
I mean, it would be kind of nice to have someonewho could actually be there.
I mean, it would be like
I mean, it would be like me telling you I had bunions.
I mean, it would be nice to hang with her in pants I don't care about.
I mean, it would be nice.
I mean, it would be one thing if I was a bad mother,
I mean, it would be one thing if they actually had remorse...
I mean, it would be perfect if it wasn't so damn sad.
I mean, it would be potentially catastrophic.
I mean, it would be so cool.
I mean, it would be the respectful thing to do.
I mean, it would be understandable.
I mean, it would be very romantic for one, but it could lead to resentment, which could lead to anger,
I mean, it would be very romantic for one, but it could lead to resentment, which could lead to anger,
I mean, it would be weird.
I mean, it would cost me more
I mean, it would cost the state over $100 million to try them separately.
I mean, it would disrupt your entire life.
I mean, it would give me nightmares digging up a dead body.
I mean, it would have been great if you'd gotten to know him,
I mean, it would have been one thing
I mean, it would have workedfor us 20 years ago.
I mean, it would hurt, right?
I mean, it would make sense that he would carry it out in the same place.
I mean, it would mean a lot to have your support on this thing.
I mean, it would mean a lot to have your support on this thing.
I mean, it would pain me, ma 'am. I...
I mean, it would probably be fun.
I mean, it would've been a sweet gesture,
I mean, it would've been okay either way, but...
I mean, it would've been okay if it was 50 points
I mean, it would've been okay if it was 50 points or even ten points, but one?
I mean, it wouldhave never have happened if we hadn'thad our talk today.
I mean, it wouldn't be bad if we, the army,
I mean, it wouldn't be hard to find her. I mean, she's a beautiful girl.
I mean, it wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have such an abnormally large head.
I mean, it wouldn't get you any answers.
I mean, it wouldn't hurt to hedge my bets and try to find a partner.
I mean, it wouldn't kill you to remove
I mean, it'd be a shame to miss your junior junior prom.
I mean, it'd be different if I could find someone
I mean, it'd be different if I could find someone I could have a normal conversation with.
I mean, it'd be different if we were married and I owed you something,
I mean, it'd be fine for, for, um,

I mean, it's one of the main ways I keep an eye on my probationers.
I mean, it's one thing for her to give me the key back,
I mean, it's one thing for her to give me the key back, but...
I mean, it's one thing for me to live my crappy life, but making you do it, too, is just cruel and unusual.
I mean, it's one thing for me to talk technical shit
I mean, it's one thing to be in love with your brother,
I mean, it's one thing to break my heart,
I mean, it's one thing to forgive bad behavior.
I mean, it's one thing to forgive bad behavior. It's another thing to reward it.
