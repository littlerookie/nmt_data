here, switch with me. I'll row.
sit down.
Hanna! Where are you?
do you think Caleb's here?
come on, let's just go back.
we are not going anywhere.
let's just forget the sign.
okay, I'm getting really cold. I just want to go back.
can you please turn this around?
Hanna, answer me! - Don't answer that.
Lucas, will you please just turn this around?
damn it, Hanna, this is hard enough for me to do, and I need to do this right now.
forget the fireworks, forget the sign, forget everything.
okay, if I asked too much, if I took advantage of you, I'm sorry...!
this is not about the stupid fireworks, Hanna!
I can't see anything. Can you see anything?
no, I can hear things, and that's enough.
Hanna! Answer us!
let's get in the car. They're probably at the pier.
no, Emily, it's a winding road. By the time that we get around- - Well, we have to do something, okay?
Hanna, answer us!
I'm calling the police.
go inside. Go!
Hey, there, it's Ezra.
can't talk, but you can, soon as you hear the...
Hi, it's me.
so, I still don't know what to say about my dad, but...
I think that my mom might be coming around.
she stopped my dad from calling the cops. That's-- that's a good sign, right?
this is not a goodbye call, this is just a please be patient call. I miss
Hey. What's up?
well, your father and I invited Holden and his family over for dinner Sunday.
great.
I was actually just on the phone with Holden.
Really? - Yep.
did he call you? - No. I called him.
we were just thinking about maybe getting together and seeing a movie or something.
but if I'm still grounded...
well, let me talk to your dad about it.
it it's Holden, you know, it might be okay.
a couple were missing, they said.
Oh, look! - Who's out there?
Oh, my God! Han, what happened?
Hanna, come here. Are you okay?
Where's Lucas? - Where's Lucas?
somebody get a blanket! Hurry!
I've got you. - Is she okay?
she swam back!
what's going on?
why is everybody out here?
where were you? We took a dip.
what?
nice night for it.
is Lucas still out there?
what's going on?
surprise.
Oh, my gosh.
no, look, look, look.
the bank loan came through. In a lasagna box?
this is our lifeline, and I will pay it all back.
if the bank finds out about your unauthorized loan, that's like a felony, right?
it's only a felony if they find out.
you're not the only one who's got stuff they wanna keep from their parents.
you busy next Friday?
Jenna, no, wait, don't hang up.
damn it!
you just gotta stop working on these videos. They're dangerous.
especially since the people that we're talking about are in this town watching me.
what are you- Hanna!
you are out of the phone tap business.
Ezra, meet me tonight at 8: 00.
if you come, it means that there's still a chance for us.
I hooked up with someone when I was away.
you said it was over, right?
it looks like he won't take no for an answer.
training a horse is an art.
you have to work with the animal, taking all the fight out if it until it truly is broken.
that's how you're gonna feel when I'm through with you.
we're moving back to rosewood.
we? - Me, Isabel, and Kate.
Kate's going to be in rosewood?
what do you mean, she destroyed the flash drive?
I kept a copy of the files, and I'll keep working on them, too, if we keep it a secret from Hanna.
check this out. - What is it?
it's just some old box. That's weird.
turn the volume up.
can you make the view full screen?
maybe make it lighter. The picture seems really dark.
all right, that's it. I've officially stopped taking requests.
can you guys like back up a little bit?
we're not even standing that close to you.
Really? Then how do I know you had a cheeseburger for lunch?
um, haven't we already seen this before?
Yeah, but look here.
it's the box Jason gave me of Ali's.
I still can't see what's inside of it, though.
just give me a second.
it's Hanna.
we may be able to get a clear shot if I - Hanna.
if I play it out frame-by-frame, Uh, I can maybe blow up the image, but then
guess we know who's low man on the totem pole.
Yeah, I can't take this anymore.
Hey, Hanna. - Hey, Spencer. What are you up to?
not much.
Oh, well, great. Do you wanna watch a movie?
Oh, come on, I'll even watch one of those artsy foreign ones you like, where all they do is stare out windows.
I'm sorry, Hanna, I really can't right now.
I'm just with my family.
Emily! - You guys, shut up!
sorry, Hanna. I really have to go.
uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. I get it.
say Hi to your family for me.
you're kidding me.
I'm sorry, she was
Hey! Ladies.
is that a driver's license? - Yeah.
is that Melissa? - I don't know.
it could be Jenna. It's just kinda hard to tell.
hold on.
it's Ali. But Ali already had a fake I.D.
and it definitely wasn't this one.
why would she need an I.D. That didn't even look like her?
God, it's so weird seeing Ali with dark hair.
I can't even look at that anymore.
sorry, guys, I gotta go.
I'm meeting up with Maya, but I'll see you tomorrow.
Bye, em. - Bye.
wait, do you have to go, too?
I was hoping that you could sleep over.
I thought maybe we could both use the company.
I'd like that, but I already made plans with Holden.
I thought you were only gonna hang out with him so you could see Ezra.
well, I was, but we actually started to become friends.
so have you heard from Ezra? - No, I haven't.
I just can't believe that he never showed up and he never called you.
Yeah. How about you? Have you talked to Toby?
no.
I didn't see his truck outside.
no, I drove it back over to his parents' house.
I just sat in it for a while and, um...And I listened to the radio.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know how you're holding it together.
believe me, I'm not as put together as I seem.
okay. You have to tell me the truth.
I feel like I'm the reason that we're lying to Hanna.
did I push us into doing this?
no, of course not.
there are just certain situations where you have to lie to your friends, even if you hate doing it.
Yeah.
are you okay? - Yeah, I just... I don't know.
you seem kind of distracted. - I am.
look, lying to my parents was one thing, but lying to my friends is really hard.
Aria, I'm not asking you to lie to your friends.
well, it's not my friends that I don't trust.
it's... other people.
I've been burned before.
I thought you said your mom was warming to the idea of us being a couple.
she's... Thawing.
and your dad?
how fast do glaciers melt? - Not very.
that's why they call it the ice age.
well, you know what that means.
it just means we have to generate more heat.
so are your friends coming over? - No.
I told you. They're being annoying.
what does that mean? - Never mind. It's not a big deal.
okay, can we talk about the elephant in the room?
Kate is not an elephant, she's a snake, and she's going to my school.
mom, my life is completely ruined.
it's not ruined, it's just gonna be an adjustment.
the only thing she's adjusting are her plans to take me down.
I spoke to your dad and he said he made it clear to Kate that there' ll be serious consequences if
Oh, please, she's not gonna listen to him.
look, Hanna...I'm not exactly looking forward to running into Isabel at the super market, but if we don't take the high road, we're gonna be the ones who end up looking like trash.
so just promise me that you will do everything you can to make Kate feel welcome tomorrow.
fine. I promise.
Hey, guys. - Hi.
how was the movie? - Pretty good. - Great.
you know what, you guys? Can you hang tight for just a sec?
I gotta get some cash out of the ATM. - Okay.
I am so sorry.
you sure know how to make a guy sweat.
no, I know. We tried to take this shortcut, and then we ended up
don't worry about it. Okay, so...
dinner. You had the pasta with pesto, and I had linguini with meat sauce.
okay, great. Did we get any sides?
Aria, your dad's not gonna ask if we ordered sides.
Oh, trust me, he will.
my mom's got him on this low-cholesterol diet, and he's living vicariously through everyone else' s meals.
okay, then... Uh, garlic bread?
sure. With extra butter.
so are we still on for tomorrow? - Yeah, sure.
what?
I just realized that this will be the third time we've gone out this week.
what are people gonna think?
let's keep 'em guessing.
so... What did you guys have for dinner?
so what' d you guys do last night?
Oh, we studied for a chem test.
we went to Spencer' s for help.
so today is doomsday, huh? - why?
did you see her? - Han, maybe Kate wants to start fresh.
the last time I gave her the benefit of the doubt, I ended up blowing chunks on my chunky heels.
Oh, my God! Is that her? - What?
never mind.
Hanna, come on, you need to relax.
I would be if you guys were doing a better job keeping a lookout.
Hanna, I never got a good look at Kate to begin with.
the only time I've ever seen her was across a crowded church.
what is hanging out under your sweater?
is that a dude's undershirt? - Maybe.
it's Toby's.
you guys, do not look at me like I'm one of those dogs with wheels for legs, okay?
em, when is your mom coming? - Tomorrow.
I'm really excited.
welcome to rosewood high. - Thanks.
Hi, I'm Kate. We haven't officially met yet.
Hey, I'm Aria.
Emily.
Spencer.
so, I got my schedule, and first period, I have history with Mr.Barocas.
Oh, yeah, Mr. Barocas. He's easy. Everybody likes him.
um, I can show you where it is. I'm actually in that class, too.
Yeah, Kate, um, have we actually met before?
you're right, we have, at the wedding.
it's nice to have met you all. Bye.
thanks for doing this.
I wouldn't have blamed you if you decided to make me fend for myself.
Yeah, don't worry about it.
are you okay? - Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's just my mom, wondering what time I'll be home for dinner.
who knows what she needed it for.
she was seeing Ian. Maybe they used it to go out together.
so maybe Ali found a loophole, a way to fly under "A's" radar.
what, by being someone else?
Yeah, the brunette on the I.D.
I was never his number one fan, but I can't even look at him now that he's with Jenna.
he's been going through girls in this school like they're Kleenex.
who cares that he's a player? He's "A's" new eyes.
it's so frustrating.
he and Jenna are always just out of reach.
if we could just get close enough to - Wait.
what if Ali wasn't trying to get away?
what if she was trying to get closer?
what do you mean?
by creating an alter-ego so she could get close enough to investigate, maybe even to expose "A."
Where's the monster?
who? - Kate.
Oh, she's at orientation, and she's being freakishly nice to me.
so why do you look like that?
do you think that Caleb still has that video file somewhere?
because "A" thinks he does.
what are you talking about?
I got a text saying to call off my techno-boy-toy.
a maybe just got their wires crossed.
Yeah, maybe they're just like a step behind or something.
since when is "A" ever a step behind?
where are you guys going?
uh, we have chem.
um, we'll talk to you later, okay?
look, Hanna, I know it's not great timing.
where are you going? To hang out with your family?
what?
Spencer, I used to be a member.
I know you guys are pissed at me for destroying the flash drive, but you can't just shut me out.
I did this to protect Caleb, and I would do it for any one of you if I could.
it just feels so weird watching them all celebrate and not being a part of it.
what can I do? Steal their swimsuits?
no, no, no, drain the pool. No, no, no, I got it, I got it.
fill their shampoo bottles with nair.
talk to me.
no, making them bald would actually give them an edge on the competition.
trust me, I've already considered it.
what? I'm kidding. But thanks for offering.
it's my mom.
so... She's coming tomorrow? - Yeah.
I've been missing her a lot lately.
does she still hate me? - She never hated you.
she hated me liking girls, but she's fine with that now.
you sure about that?
cause the last time I your mom, she was getting me hauled off to druggie boot-camp.
okay, she didn't know that your parents were gonna send you there.
besides, she's a completely different person now.
I'll believe it when I see it.
so you moved here from Baltimore?
Yeah, so I can still go home on weekends and visit my friends.
that's nice.
do you have any family in Maine, by any chance? - Nope. No, all in Maryland.
have you ever been to Maine?
the northeast harbor area? - Nope.
so, Kate, will you be joining any clubs or sports teams?
Yeah, I was actually thinking - Debate!
orchestra.
sorry, I thought I must've seen you at a debate.
are you sure that we haven't met before? - Pretty sure.
so I'm gonna head to class early and introduce myself to the teacher.
I will see you all soon.
Bye.
what are you doing?
I know her. I know I know her. I just don't know where I know her from.
can you back off? I'm not gonna let her complain to my dad that my friends are giving her the fourth degree.
it's the third degree. - Whatever. Just stop giving her degrees, okay?
so did you?
mom!
look how gorgeous you are! I feel like I haven't seen you in ages!
it's only been a couple weeks.
now wait a minute. Are you getting taller, or am I just getting shorter?
shorter, and early. I thought you weren't getting in until later tonight.
I know, but I wanted to surprise you.
chocolate macadamia? - Yes.
and don't eat it yet, because I made us an early reservation at the grille.
Hey, do you wanna invite the girls?
I think they have plans tonight, but...
is there someone else you'd like to invite? Someone special?
maybe someone new?
in a way. It's Maya.
we started seeing each other again.
is she going to school here? - No, Radford.
her family moved to Radford, so she's going to school there.
well, why don't you ask her if she wants to join us for dinner.
Really? I know you weren't crazy about Maya.
honey, there was a lot going on back then.
I feel like I really never gave her a chance and it'd be nice to have another opportunity.
Hey, come on, you guys. Let's go.
Hanna, come on.
Spence, you coming?
uh, yeah, I'll see you guys in there.
having trouble?
it'll come to me.
you know, it's funny.
I can remember every single locker combination I've ever had, going all the way back to middle school.
impressive.
but ultimately useless.
but that's why I knew I'd eventually get it.
Shekomeko horse ranch, summer of 2006.
I don't know what you're talking about.
my sister Melissa was a junior counselor that year, and you were in her bunk.
fine. You win.
we went to camp together, and, yes, I'm her. I'm exactly who you think I am.
so what is it gonna take?
what do you mean?
for you to keep this to yourself.
do you want money?
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
but just so you know, Melissa sent me a bunk photo that year.
so if you being nice to Hanna is just an act, you'd better keep it up.
why are you giving me a break?
because judging from the way that you treated Hanna, everybody's gonna see how ugly you are without any help from me.
if you have any trouble with the app, just give me a call.
I put my digits in there. - Cool, thanks.
Hi, Maya. It's great to see you.
you look beautiful.
you know what they say about clean living.
well, whatever you're doing, it's working for you.
Thanks.
I'm just gonna let her know that we're ready, okay?
so when did Noel become your phone repair guy?
Oh, he saw me struggling and offered to help.
he's really sweet.
no, he's not.
but his smile takes up half his face, so I see how you could be confused.
all right, ladies, I think our table's ready.
nice work, Pam. You say jump and they say how high, huh?
okay, so my dad said that he'd pick us up at 11: 00.
do you wanna meet back here at quarter till?
sounds good. - Great.
well, have a good night. - You, too.
Thanks.
actually, my plans kinda got cancelled.
so I was just gonna wait here till you got back.
you're kidding.
no, it's fine, really. I brought magazines.
I just didn't wanna bail on you.
I didn't wanna bail on you. My plans got cancelled, too.
Seriously?
well, why didn't you tell me?
I don't know. Why didn't you tell me?
because I didn't wanna ruin your night. - Same here.
okay, well, should I call my dad and have him pick us up early?
look, seeing as we were both gonna kill time here anyway, you wanna order a large to split?
I don't know. I'm not really
I'll even get half plain, half green peppers.
your favorite, right?
I cannot believe that you actually remember that.
you know what else I remember?
you, uh, used to be kind of a mean player.
still got the chops?
I kinda just wanted to sit and read.
Oh, so you don't.
okay, let's go. You're on.
you're dead, by the way.
so, mom, Maya joined the jazz band at her new school, and they're really good.
wonderful. Thank you.
you know, actually, when I was in college, I had a huge poster of Miles Davis right over my bed.
I absolutely worshipped that man.
Really?
that's surprising.
Really?
I mean, what kind of music would you think I would have been listening to?
Oh, I don't know.
classical music, I guess.
something very sophisticated.
well, I think jazz is sophisticated.
the notebook.
um, I'm actually trying to wean myself off of that one.
right, no, we don't have to watch that one.
you know what? - No, let's watch it.
I'm just really glad that you came over.
so I'm not in the doghouse with you guys anymore?
no, you never were.
well, good, because I really don't need to stress out about that on top of all this Kate crap.
Hanna, I really don't think that you need to worry about Kate.
she's been nothing but nice to you, right?
Oh, yeah, but it's a trap.
do you remember in bio we learned about those animals that can change their appearance to look harmless and then they lull their prey into a false sense of security and then they just bite their heads off?
that's Kate.
Hanna, do not lose sleep over this girl.
no, it's those fish! What are they called?
Fangblennies. - Yes.
Kate is a fangblenny. - No.
she's a boil and baggy.
I don't remember that one. Is that like a blowfish?
I am showing you this to prove that you have nothing to worry about.
did you hear me?
what are those? They're bug bites.
God, it looks like something laid eggs on her face and then exploded.
I want more.
Melissa said everyone felt sorry for her for like a minute, and she was the one with the skin condition, but she treated everyone else like lepers.
what's this? - It's an I.D.
how did you get it?
Caleb came over after you destroyed the flash drive, and he offered to help us as long as we kept it a secret.
from me?
no, please, just let me explain - No, don't even try to apologize.
Hanna, no, come on, stay and talk to me.
I am such an idiot!
this whole time I'm worried about Kate backstabbing me, I didn't even realize that you were holding a knife.
is there a menu? - No, thank you. We're fine.
okay. I'm gonna go find our waiter and get the bill.
what the hell was that?
I thought we could get a brownie to split.
stop. Why were you acting like that?
you're the one who's been freezing me out for the last 30 minutes.
because you completely torpedoed dinner.
how do you see that?
you kept making jokes about weed.
I made one joke and every time I tried to changed the subject, you brought it back to true north.
I asked you to start over with my mom.
and that's what I was doing.
I was trying to be honest.
being honest is fine.
you were trying to get a rise out of her.
why else would you bring up dating that guy?
I finally got my mom to come on board with me dating girls and you bring that up?
it's confusing for her.
is the fact that I dated a guy confusing for your mom...or for you?
all right, we're all set.
I'm glad you could join us.
thank you for inviting me. It's an honor.
no, it's a bunch of boring old farts discussing dead authors.
but it's nice to have some young blood in the mix.
I'll admit, I have an ulterior motive for dragging you here.
I've recommended you for an associate dean's position at the new Hollis satellite school.
I don't know what to say. I had no idea. It's an honor.
if the board approves, and I can't see why they wouldn't, you would need to be in Louisiana by the beginning of the month.
I assumed that the extension program was in Philadelphia.
no, it's in New Orleans.
we're participating in a grant program set up to revitalize the city.
well, I think I'll need a few days to think about it.
Ezra, I'll be candid.
you weren't on the short-list for this position.
it's only because Byron Montgomery insisted you were perfect for the job that I even considered it.
I don't get it.
you knew how long it took me to trust you again.
why would you ruin that?
I didn't think you'd find out.
wrong answer.
just let me finish, okay?
I didn't think you'd find out until I solved whatever it is you guys are trying to solve.
I don't need that. I needed you not to go behind my back.
Hanna, I know that you were trying to protect me, but I was worried about you.
you're not the only one I'm trying to protect, Caleb.
last year, it was really bad for me and my mom.
what do you mean?
no one really even knew because...I was still wearing the same clothes and driving the same car, but we were totally broke.
what's broke?
it might mean something completely different for you than it does to me.
we almost lost our house.
my mom got money from the bank to tide us over.
do you still need - No.
that's not why I'm telling you.
my mom didn't borrow money from the bank.
she stole it.
I've never told anyone that, not even my friends.
thank you for trusting me.
I promise I won't tell anybody.
but someone else knows.
and they're holding it over me.
who? Who? Is it Jenna?
I don't know who it is.
but it's their phone that you're working on.
winning really brings out the nerd in you, huh?
okay, I'm gonna ignore all of your hostility right now because I know that it comes from a place of shame.
how about some soda? - That's cool. I got.
so what happened to that theatre guy?
uh, he couldn't make it tonight.
how long have you two been, uh...
we don't need to talk about that.
rematch?
gonna massacre you again.
what were you doing? - Just knocking on the door.
who were you looking for? - Jenna.
have you seen her? - No, not for a while.
what do you wanna see her about? - That's between me and her.
well, if you're looking to get your old job back, it's too late.
she found someone else. - No.
actually, I came by to tell her to stop threatening Hanna and her friends.
you better be a lot scarier than that if you want Jenna to take you seriously.
I'm gonna go now. - Yeah, you do that.
look out for and that see you in don't slam the door in my face.
I wasn't going to.
what I did, it wasn't an act of betrayal.
it was an act of desperation.
we've all been desperate. That's not an excuse.
okay, I know.
it's just that "A" has taken everything from me.
please, I can't lose you, too.
you haven't.
so my dad just texted, and he's almost here.
sorry, man.
are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
what is that from? - Oh, it's nothing. I play touch football.
so does my little brother, and I've never seen a bruise like that on him before.
please don't say anything.
Holden, that's a serious bruise.
promise me you won't say anything.
I was so stupid.
I thought if we could use the phone to nail "A" once and for all, it'd be worth the risk.
makes sense.
I don't know.
we got nothing from the I.D.
it was a complete dead end.
I'm not so sure.
I didn't tell you this earlier 'cause I was mad, but I've seen Ali with dark hair before.
you have? - Yeah, about two years ago.
Vivian, listen to me. It's fierce.
can you please get miss Darkbloom a cup of coffee?
it's your first time here, isn't, honey?
Yeah. Okay.
you want cream or sugar, Vivian?
no thanks, I don't like it sweet.
what are you doing here? - My mom made me an appointment.
I didn't know you came here. - Your hair looks great.
I didn't even recognize you.
just trying something new, testing the waters.
here's the thing. I'm pretending to be someone else, so play along.
okay... But why?
because I'm bored. I do it a lot.
you should try it some time.
I mean, aren't you just sick and tired of being you?
I guess I never told you guys before because I thought it was just typical Ali weirdness.
what is it?
it's the name on the I.D.
Vivian Darkbloom. It's gotta be.
now if we can only find out where she used it, maybe we can figure out why.
"Vivian Darkbloom" gets over 300, 000 hits.
is that good or bad?
"Vivian Darkbloom" is a pseudonym for Vladimir Nabokov.
it's an anagram of his name.
speak English.
there were like ten big words in there I didn't understand.
he's an author. He wrote Lolita.
is that the book with the heart-shaped glasses on the cover?
Yeah. How did you know that?
I stole it... From Ali. - What? Why?
I didn't really steal it, I borrowed it, but I kept seeing her with it, and I was curious.
I was supposed to give it back to her, but I never got the chance.
Hey, sorry I missed your call.
it's kind of early.
I know. I wanted to talk before school.
the thing is...
I do have a problem with you dating that guy, but not for the reasons you think.
I have a problem with you dating anyone but me, and knowing you're into guys and girls, it just doubles the amount of people I have to compete with.
trust me, you have no competition.
and you were right. As much as I'd like to be zen about it, I'm still mad at your mom for busting me.
so now what? - Can I show you something?
I started working on this last night.
can I open my eyes now? - Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.
this is so beautiful.
my way of saying sorry for ruining dinner.
if the sharks won't let you back in the water, I'll bring the water to you.
I can't believe you would do all this for me.
I admit, I like to live life in the grey area, but the way I feel about you is crystal clear.
I love you, Emily.
I love you, too, Maya.
Hello, J&L.
Hey, you guys are open. - Yeah.
I just found my claim ticket. It's a little bit crazy. It's from a really long time ago.
what's the number? - 0421.
all right, hang on a sec.
it's a miracle, but I actually still have it.
when would you like to pick it up, miss Darkbloom?
miss Darkbloom, are you still there? Hello? - Yes, I'm here.
Thanks, Marin.
you made my day.
what?
what the hell were you thinking? - About what?
if that's taking the high road, what's the low road?
did you have a stroke? You promised you wouldn't say anything.
Hanna, why would you do this? You're gonna be in so much trouble.
can one of you guys please tell me what I did?
I didn't do this.
where would I have even taken that picture?
it looks like it was taken in the girls' locker room.
no, I did not send this to you guys.
Hanna, you didn't just send it to us. You sent it to everybody in your address book.
if you didn't send this- Do we even have to ask
that's what you got from from Ali's claim ticket?
check it out. - What is that?
it's a phone number. - Let's call it.
I don't want to do this on the phone. Will you meet me?
are we still on for Saturday?
I just don't know if I can handle it if you're hurting yourself.
what does the DiLaurentis family have on us?
it's complicated.
my dad, is he your father too?
let's go home. - Where's home? That's a joke.
you just gotta stop working on these videos. They're dangerous.
especially since the people that we're talking about are in this town watching me.
take this home and burn it.
is it page five?
there's nothing left that could link us to that night.
our championship Rosewood Sharks are running a little behind but they'll be here any minute.
I thought you couldn't get online in this cave.
I've got a hotspot in my pocket.
Yeah, I know, but what does that have to do with computers?
I am the WiFi. Koo-koo-katchoo.
where are they?
I told my mom we'd be studying at the library so that's covered. - Good.
you sure you wanna do this tonight?
Yeah, are you kidding?
we have to find out what this guy knows about Ali.
and why his number was in Ali's- - Vivian's coat.
and we finally got this meeting set, so it's gotta be tonight.
look, we're gonna have your back the whole time. - I know.
so my mom talked to your mom.
you know it wasn't just one sleepover, Spence.
it's been a whole week.
my mom just wants to know why you're not going home.
I just-- I can't deal with my family right now.
Yeah! Yeah!
Hi.
I know, the sign's kinda nerdy.
the sign's beautiful.
way to go, champ! - Hey!
em, my mom said that we could have the team party at my house.
that's great! - Yeah.
Caleb Rivers? I got a court order here to impound your laptop.
what for? Someone's been hacking into secure school files.
I traced them back to your IP address.
you think if I did something like that I'd be stupid enough to leave a trail?
we'll find out. Come on. Hand it over.
any passwords we're gonna need?
court order says you can take the machine. It doesn't say anything about what's in my head.
what was that about? - Don't worry about it.
don't worry about it? - He took your computer.
they couldn't get into it with a can opener.
be right back.
what just happened? - Garret took Caleb's computer. Court order.
why aren't you more freaked out about this?
because I think you're freaked out enough for the both of us.
Hey. I didn't do what they think I did.
they're just fishing. They made it up. There's nothing on my laptop.
what about the information from the phone we gave you?
I keep it on flash drives. Ii back it up online.
besides, if there was shady stuff on my computer, it still wouldn't matter.
Yes, it would. It does.
no, they couldn't get through my firewall. Not without my help.
Caleb, you know how I was worried about something bad happening to you?
if you kept decoding the stupid phone? - Yeah.
well, this is it.
someone broke into your computer and put those stolen files on your hard drive where you wouldn't be able to find them.
and I think that someone might be Garrett.
how do you know that? - I just do.
so can't you just go online and do that magic thing where you remotely hack into your computer and erase all the scary, bad stuff?
it's a real thing, right? - Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.
Holden, I told you.
I can't cover for you unless I know what it is that you're doing and why it involves these baggies filled with
I do Tang Soo Do. - What?
it's a martial art. It's Korean.
I compete, and my parents don't like it.
they forbid me to keep training.
everyone's got teeth.
Holden, I'm serious.
that bruise was pretty intense. - All better.
those pills were just some pain meds I never even used.
it's really not a big deal.
and there's a tournament coming up.
it's a big one, and tomorrow night's the qualifiers. I-- I can't miss it.
so, please. This is really important to me.
okay. All right. It's a date.
all the letters are initials of cities where I grew up in the order that I lived there.
so, Seattle, Wilmette, etc.
I also alternate capital letters.
1105? What's that? - Nothing. Just a number.
it's good to use numbers in your password.
just a number? There was an exclamation point after it.
Yeah, well, it's good to use punctuation too.
once I'm logged in, I can search and destroy all of the files I want.
crap! - What?
what's wrong? - I can't connect.
well, don't you have your hot thing? - Spot. Yeah, but the problem is on the other end.
either they haven't even tried to mess with my computer yet, or they're smart enough to keep it off line.
why are you having drinks with Noreen?
why do you think?
aria needs a ride into the city. - Holden?
when did that happen? - About 15 minutes ago.
well, I hate Noreen.
I know, that's why I didn't invite you.
that one goes to the book fair.
you know, if you were open to letting Aria take the train, I wouldn't have to find ways to kill time in Philadelphia.
or, Aria and Holden can just do something right here in town.
Byron, when are we gonna loosen the leash a little?
hasn't she won back some of our trust?
I mean, she stopped seeing Fitz, she's dating a nice kid we've known since pre-school.
second guessing her every move is starting to feel a little extreme.
no, dating your English teacher is extreme.
all right? We are being parents.
we're being- - I'm sorry.
I'm just not ready yet. Okay?
I'll come back for the other box.
I've been looking for you. Your office is closed.
Yeah, I only work a couple hours a day.
getting the place up and running again.
did your father send you? - No, I haven't talked to him.
you still don't believe it.
I believe it, that's why I haven't talked to him.
I haven't talked to anybody about this.
well, you better talk to your dad.
no, I'm talking to you.
look, I didn't come back here to get between you and your father.
well it's a little late for that.
I'm sorry. I really am.
this was never about hurting you.
well, what is it about?
please, Jason.
you left town the night that I was arrested.
so what made you come back now?
it was another one of those boxes Ali liked so much.
I found it under the floorboards of a room at my grandmother's.
why hide things that stay hid?
something Ali used to say.
there were letters to my mom from your dad.
love letters? - Couple of those.
then I'm born, and he starts sounding like a lawyer.
in light of recent events. "Under the current situation. - " That's my dad.
there was something else in that box.
$15, 000 in cash.
in envelopes. $5, 000 in each one.
where would Ali have gotten that kind of money?
think about it.
she found those letters and figured out what they meant and then she blackmailed my father to keep from blowing up both families.
I know. It's hard to believe when you say it out loud.
Yeah, but if anybody had the nerve to do something like that it was Ali.
so, you're a friend of Vivian's. - Yeah.
how much money does she owe you?
Vivian owes you money?
she owes me a lot more than money.
she owes me a job and she almost owes me a girlfriend thanks to you calling that number.
you said that she cost you a job. What did she do?
I worked at Allegheny Cellular. Human resources.
your friend came in asking for a job, but she didn't want a job, she wanted information, and she said she'd pay for it.
what kind of information? - I get it. You're Alison.
Vivian told you about Alison?
she said she had a friend named Alison that was getting texts from somebody.
the number was blocked and she wanted to know where they were coming from.
she'd pay to find out. - Did you find out?
Yeah, I found out.
then I made the mistake of telling your pal before I had the money in my hand.
she dropped off the map and I got fired for accessing restricted information.
what did you find out about the person that was sending those texts?
are you listening? I did not get paid. I want what she owes me.
how much does she owe you? - $2, 000.
$2, 000 dollars? - That's the price today.
but it could go up depending on market conditions.
don't ever use that number again.
if you wanna do business, call me here.
Oh, who do I ask for when I call?
tell 'em you wanna talk to Jonah.
I think he felt I was Ali.
that means he doesn't know she's dead.
and if he finds out there won't be enough money in the world to make him talk.
if this Jonah had real information, Ali might've known who "A" was.
and that's why she was killed.
we have to find out what he told her about those messages.
what are we supposed to do? Throw a bikini car wash?
even if we talked Prudence Finn into a tube top, we wouldn't raise enough money.
Spencer?
my account's been on lock down since we were arrested.
so where are we gonna get the money from?
do have any idea when I can get the thing back?
because I'm a high school student. I've got papers to write and homework to do.
Plus, they cost a lot of money. Plus, it's mine.
Caleb, was that the cops? What'd they say?
they said I could get my laptop back today.
Really? - Yeah, if I cooperate.
What're you going to do?
so, we're on for tonight. I worked things out on my end.
good, 'cause we really gotta talk about that interview.
I need to get back to Shaffer tomorrow at the latest.
Yeah, we'll talk about it. I know this is a huge opportunity for you.
no, that's not what matters. It's what your dad thinks if I don't take it.
Yeah, well, maybe he should just move to New Orleans.
we should have this conversation face to face, but I just don't really know where.
I do. There's this tiny, hole in the wall vegan place that just opened up, center city.
wait, a restaurant? - Lower your expectations. It seats two.
Oh, so it's bigger than your apartment. What's it called? - Chez Mirabelle Vegan Bistro.
french food? Wow, you must really like me.
Aria, it's French vegan food. I must really love you.
tempting, isn't it?
the I. T. guys say not to open it.
it could connect to the wireless.
your, uh, your guys have any luck getting in? - Not yet.
might have to send it to Pittsburgh.
I-- I bet we could get the kid to talk.
so, Alison DiLaurentis murder investigation turned up a new piece of evidence.
it has to do with the missing page of the autopsy report.
tell me what you think is going on in this photo.
can't we get him a lawyer or something?
I know you wanna help. But Caleb's got a family now.
if he needs legal help- - He won't ask them.
he doesn't want them to know. He's barely talking to me about it.
Hello?
I come bearing fruit.
great. Something wrong?
um, can we talk? - Sure.
I'll be down in a minute. - Okay.
Hey, Maya. - Hey.
put down the icing. We've been invited to the police station.
what do you mean it was an old joint?
old, as in, pre-getting busted and packed off to camp straight and narrow.
where did your mom find it?
we've been getting stuff out of storage.
boxes from when we lived in the DiLaurentis house.
I even found a box of Ali's stuff.
it was in junk from my dresser.
half an old, dried-up joint.
you explained that it was from before, right?
they don't believe me.
em, my folks are gonna send me back to True North.
we'll go talk to your parents. We'll explain it.
I mean, they can't just ship you off again.
Emily-- - No!
I'm not gonna say goodbye to you again.
never.
how you been, Ashley? - Fine.
it's been a while.
doesn't feel that way to me.
I called you in to talk about Alison's murder investigation.
copies of a particular page of her autopsy report have been stolen.
we've been looking into it. And we found this.
this is from a security camera outside the morgue.
anything you can tell me about that photo, Hanna?
okay. Almost have them giving me my own parking space.
and why weren't Emily and Spencer and their parents called in as well?
you may not have to answer his questions, but you're sure as hell going to answer mine.
what were you doing in those outfits?
we put them on as a joke.
a joke.
we dared Spencer to go in the morgue.
I didn't know there were files in there.
I already told you I know when you're lying.
we did not take that page.
mom said that Spencer just left. She go home? - No, to Hanna's.
em's throwing a victory party for the swim team.
so, where are you and Holden headed off to this time?
some new arcade.
they're supposed to have all these really cool vintage games.
ms. PacMan, Pinball... - Oh, that sounds fun.
Yeah. - And, uh, what time is Mom taking you?
uh, now-ish.
and you'll be home...? - At 11: 00, Dad.
you meeting any other friends there? - Nope. It's just me and Holden.
and some nerdy gamers with very creative facial hair.
are you holding her up?
no, she's-- she's all yours.
um, So maybe it's time you and Holden started hanging out a little closer to home.
Holden just likes going into the city.
there's a lot more to do there.
museums and street fairs. There's more than just one restaurant.
Yeah, but from the way his mom talks, I mean
I'm surprised they're okay with him being that far away all the time.
far away? It's an hour.
you know what I mean. She's worried about him.
and if something happens- - What?
mom, what would happen?
honey, he has a heart condition. He's talked about that with you, hasn't he? - Yeah. No, yeah, yeah. Of course he has.
okay. Well, you know. Think about it.
the cops called them down there?
which cops? - I don't know.
there was a note on the counter when I came downstairs with Maya.
I'm going upstairs trusting you to keep an eye on everything down here.
okay. - Hey.
what's going on with Caleb? - I don't know.
that's not why we were called down there. Wilden's back.
he still thinks we had something to do with Ali's murder.
there's a photo of the three of us outside the coroner's office looking for page five.
a was following us? - No. Security cameras.
there's an investigation going on; He said the copies of that page are missing.
copies? As in every copy?
if the cops don't have it then it had to have been an inside job.
officer two-face is gonna open that laptop.
I mean, what if Caleb goes to jail?
it's gonna be all my fault.
it's not gonna happen.
What're you doing?
Jonah knows something that could help us figure out what really happened to Alison.
Wilden is just gonna keep on coming after us.
so we need to find out who killed Alison so we can prove it wasn't us.
okay, unless you found $2, 000 while I was out-- Where are you going?
home.
there was some weird energy in that car.
is your mom starting to wonder? - No. No, they're clueless.
okay, well I'm this way and I'm gonna be late.
you know where you're going? - Yeah.
this tournament, is it dangerous?
I get it. You're still on that bruise.
don't worry. I got a rematch against the guy who gave it to me.
it's gonna be epic.
wish me luck. - Bye.
I'm glad you came home.
your mother and I were both getting our Degrees.
she was in Boston.
Ken and Jessica had an apartment on Willoughby.
then what happened?
what happened is, I made a series of very poor decisions.
you make it sound like a business deal.
this wasn't a bad investment.
you cheated and you got somebody else's wife pregnant.
that's what happened. - Yes.
and she kept the baby. - She kept the baby.
she lied to her husband, they moved to Atlanta.
I married your mother.
just like nothing happened.
then they moved back. - Yeah, right next door.
you were five.
first time I saw Jason, he was in front of that house.
just riding his bike.
and how did that make you feel?
why did they come back? - I never asked.
I was afraid she might tell me.
Jason thinks that Alison knew about you long before he did.
I guess that's possible. I don't know.
Really? You sure that you don't know?
what's that supposed to mean?
it means that Jason found some money and letters from you.
so did Ali ever ask you for money? - For what?
to keep her quiet?
Spencer, wai-- Look, I know I don't have a lot of credibility with you right now.
but you have to listen to me.
I never gave money to anyone in that family for any reason.
um, do you mind if I sit over there?
Thanks.
thank you.
I hope your mom got Paige coming off the platform. She was like a rocket.
Hey. You okay?
I guess I'm not in a party mood.
can we go someplace?
after the party? Sure.
em! You're missing it!
go ahead. I'm okay. Go.
what? And you believe him? - Yes, I do.
he must've been really convincing.
I think that he was telling me the truth.
if he didn't give Ali this money, then who did?
well, where is it now? The money.
does he want you to get it back? - No.
I already told you he didn't give it to her.
just because you believe him doesn't mean I have to.
if Ali was blackmailing somebody- - Not somebody, Spencer. It was your father.
well, what if it wasn't?
it has to be him.
you don't want it to be someone else.
you want it to be him so that you can keep on being angry.
Yeah. You were raised by lawyers.
where are you? I thought you'd be here an hour ago.
that actually might be a while.
well, where are you right now? - Police station.
what, you're going to talk to them?
I don't think I have any choice.
so you said Garrett knows how to get in anyway?
I don't know. I think so.
Hanna, listen to me.
I'm in a really hot spot right now.
I know, Caleb. - Hanna, I need your help.
this way.
right!
come on!
What're you doing here?
what's wrong with your heart?
excuse me?
my mom says that you have some kind of condition.
What're you doing? Is this some kind of death wish?
just keep your voice down.
now what exactly did your mom tell you? - It doesn't matter. I wanna hear it from you.
okay, I wanna know exactly what I'm supposed to say when you don't make it back at the end of the night because somebody kicked you in the chest.
that's not gonna make my heart stop, Aria.
I have an abdominal aortic aneurism, okay?
wh-- tell me what that means.
it means that I gotta live with it.
it could rupture whether I'm out doing what I love or I'm at home playing apples to apples with my parents.
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life sitting in front of a TV.
especially when there's a decent chance it's gonna be shorter than everyone else's.
but not telling your parents that you're doing this, it's really, really messed up, Holden.
okay, and I know that I'm lying to mine too, but it not's like I'm taking my life into my own hands.
look, sometimes what people believe is best for you is not what is actually best for you.
gentlemen, line up. Turn, face the table.
to your positions.
fight stance.
we're glad we didn't have to contact any of your family in California.
I know that would've been hard on you the way this sort of thing looks.
you don't have to call them.
I didn't do anything wrong.
you asked me to come in, here I am.
I wanna watch you login.
make sure there's no funny business. - Okay.
you sure you want me to show him what's on here?
start typing.
Hey. I got your SOS. What's wrong?
please tell me you know how to hack into computers.
uh, no. That's what Caleb was for.
well, Caleb is at the police station right now cooperating with this whole investigation.
unless we figure out how to hack into his hard drive and delete all the files "A" planted, he's screwed.
okay. Do you know his password? - I did.
that wasn't an old joint your mother found.
it wasn't a new joint, it just wasn't that old.
why would you lie to me?
I'm a guest in this house and my teammates- - Oh, God, please.
no more about the teammates.
what's wrong with them? - Nothing, nothing. They're perfect.
Maya. - You're better at fitting in than I am.
I thought you didn't care about that.
Yeah, well, I'm pretty convincing.
listen, we can still talk to your parents.
I won't go back to True North.
we'll work it out.
no way I'm going back there.
I've got friends in San Francisco.
you can't just run away.
you could come with me.
I can't do that.
not even for me?
no, I guess you couldn't.
not with the team counting on you.
okay, it's the first initials of every city he's ever lived in.
in that order? - Yes.
Oh, and he alternates capital and lower case letters.
wow this is almost as mmplicated as my password.
any punctuation? - Yes!
an exclamation point after the last four numbers.
last four numbers? There are four more numbers?
okay, what are they?
ready. Go!
that is point this side.
ready
stand over there. Go.
what else could it be? - I don't know!
we only have one more try until we're locked out of the system.
just think, Hanna! - I am thinking! This is me thinking!
and molting!
you said, 1, 1, something, 5.
1, 1, something, 5.
1, 1, something- - That is not helping!
is it a-- a code? Is it a date? Or part of a phone number?
is it a birthday? Is it an anniversary? Or
Oh, my God! We're in!
we did it!
Hanna? - Yes?
what do we do now?
break!
break!
go on.
fall! Point, this side.
ready, go!
there are million files on here.
it's like looking inside of his brain.
which one is it?
it's gotta be hefty.
that bitch. This is it.
Ssocial Security number, credit card information. Student records.
Spence, how much is on here?
somebody who really wants Caleb out of their way.
break!
break!
I said break!
all right?
judges' call, right hand.
the folder's clean Try the next one.
be sure to check out my video selection.
we're taking too long, Hanna. Just Control, A.
I'm going as fast as I can!
it's not fast enough, Hanna! Just Control, A.
control, A!
what the hell do youthink I'm trying to do?
no, hit Control, A on the keyboard!
why are the files disappearing? - What'd you do?
nothing! I just clicked on it!
you must've done something.
typed in a code, or, or- - I told you. I was hacked.
probably got a virus or something.
back to the line.
ready, and bow!
winner, red side!
you stayed.
didn't you have a date? - We rescheduled.
I'm not used to having an audience. It's nice.
maybe you can come to the next- - No. Thank you.
you were amazing.
I still think you're an idiot though.
look, I get not wanting to rot in front of the TV, but this...
this can't be what the doctor ordered.
no, he recommended gardening. This is better.
dad. Hey, what's up?
Yeah, yeah, I'm just at the arcade with Holden.
Yeah, I know, sorry. It's kind of loud in here.
um, sure.
he wants to talk to you.
Hi, Mr. Montgomery.
Yeah, I-- I'm sorry to bother you.
Ella just thought she lost your mom's number.
Thanks. Okay.
Yeah, you too, Holden.
did it. What? - 1105? November 5th?
you couldn't have just told me that it was the night that we-- you know.
Hanna, there's an exclamation point.
let's get out of here. - No.
let's throw it in his face a little longer.
he's not here. - I know.
I checked for his car. I wanted to talk to you.
look, if I screwed up before, I am sorry.
I don't really have an etiquette book for how people in our situation are supposed to treat each other.
I'm the one who's sorry.
you are?
because you were right, Spencer.
I don't wanna find out Ali was blackmailing someone else.
I want it to be him. - Because?
because that would make things so much easier.
but there's really nothing easy about this, is there?
no, not so far.
you know why we act like this, don't you?
why the two of us always seems to be facing off?
because we're wired the same.
I think I know why Ali needed that money.
at least a part of it. - Why?
she was looking for someone.
someone that she was afraid of.
who?
I think that I can find that out, but I'm going to need you to trust me, a lot.
a lot? - $2, 000 worth.
Maya, we have to fix this.
I feel sick about fighting with you. Please call.
okay. Don't do anything until we talk.
I love you.
you said you knew who dug up Ali' s grave?
I didn't kill Alison.
what was snatched from her grave would have proved it.
people lie. Medical records don't.
are those teeth?
it wasn't enough to steal her bones, we're gonna get pieces of her delivered to us?
you have made my life a nightmare! You owe me!
I lost my accompanist for next week's assembly, and I thought of asking you to play with me.
did you study for this?
I did the best I could.
there's a lot riding on this for her. Maybe if. She could take it again.
there's no need for her to take it again.
Lucas. What is he doing out so late? Shh!
real teeth or not, that was definitely stolen from Ali' s grave.
I can't talk. My new attorney made me promise.
I remembered. She was driving that night.
bitch can see!
God, what a performance.
can you imagine faking it for so long?
what do you think she's planning?
that's what you have to find out.
she trusts you.
or at least she wants you to think that she does.
great. That... That's awesome.
Hey, I'll trade you Mona for Jenna. - No, thanks.
I think I felt safer when Mona wasn't talking. - There she goes.
we should push a table in front of her and see what happens.
God, Hanna, you have all the subtlety of a hand grenade.
thank you.
has your mom said anything to you about taking Garrett's case?
not yet. But Melissa's coming home tomorrow, so she'll probably tell both of us at the same time.
cause that's how it works in my family... We keep the one-on-ones to a minimum.
you're not helping yourself, Mr. Gottesman.
this all goes on your permanent record!
why is vice-principal Hackett so mad at you?
I'm supposed to give this to my parents.
it looks like I've lost my "positive attitude."
negatively impacting my social interactions and grades.
Impacting?
"Impacting." That's not even a word.
are you okay? - Yeah.
yeah... I'm just fine.
no... Lucas, what are you doing?!
stop!
what the hell is going on?!
Caleb, look, we've gotta get out of here.
he'll be fine.
Lucas used to he'll bebe so sweet.
Hanna, the last word a guy wants a girl to describe him with sweet.
well, now he's a sour patch kid.
he's just... making up for lost time.
going through all the bad boy behavior he saved up for senior year.
you think so? You still talk to him?
not much since I moved out of his house.
will you talk to him? For me? Please?
I guess.
but I need you to do something for me. - Name it.
I want to make sure that you're clear on this other situation.
Caleb, Mona's not dangerous anymore.
she's under lock and key. - Keep it that way.
you don't owe her anything.
okay!
"okay" meaning you won't go out there anymore?
you're sweet.
so what made you change your mind about playing with me?
um, I guess I was just intimidated by the whole idea of playing in front of an audience.
stage fright. - Yeah.
there's only one way to deal with that: you face it.
you look it in the eye.
uh, yeah.
come over after school. We'll practice.
sounds good.
look it in the eye? - That's what she said.
that opens a whole new dimension of creepy.
Toby found her eye drops, and Garrett's in jail.
maybe she's getting careless about hiding things.
Yeah, like that other earring.
if you find that, case closed.
Jenna is working with this "A."
it's not just the earring that we have to worry about.
whoever opened Ali' s grave found all the other things we put inside that coffin.
we're gonna sort it out, em.
I can snoop and play the keyboard at the same time.
maybe this is a trap.
I'm also pretty good at running.
do you remember when she knocked over that beehive?
it's your mom. She posted the grades for that makeup test.
might as well get that over with.
wait a minute. You knocked over that beehive.
Yeah, but it's a better story if she did it.
no, this can't be right.
I got a 94 on the test.
I wish I was pulling nineties.
em, don't go all Spencer on your grades.
excuse me. - No, I couldn't have gotten that.
I didn't even finish the test. - So it was a mistake.
but you don't think it was a mistake.
the last thing I need right now is people thinking I cheated.
wait, Em. You think that someone went into the school computer - and boosted your grade? - Someone in particular?
wait. Are we getting a little paranoid right now?
you're not paranoid if someone's really out to get you.
is there something I can help you with?
dude, you tried to set fire to my girlfriend.
Yeah, sorry about that. I was being ground down by a trivial bureaucracy.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but is there something that you want to talk about?
what I want is for you to mind your own business.
something I'm usually pretty good at, but there are other people involved.
Hanna's worried about you. - Yeah, like you worry about pet.
tell her to save her energy. She's got bigger problems.
I know all about Mona being "A." Hanna told me.
it's the tip of the iceberg.
lots more under the surface.
ancient history. - More like current events.
you know, ripped from today's headlines?
what headlines are we talking about?
icebergs turn over. Did you know that?
they just... roll over and bring up all of that buried junk.
you don't want to get too close when that happens.
is that a threat?
it's an observation.
Mrs. Montgomery? Can I talk to you?
of course.
I wanted to ask you about the makeup test.
I saw my grade, and I think there's something wrong.
I don't think it's... Well, are you sure it's accurate?
very sure.
I got a 94.
I know.
how could I get a 94 on a test I didn't complete?
I think somebody did something to the test paper before you graded it, and I just want you to know I had nothing to do with it.
Emily, it's all right. The test was completed.
Yeah. I don't think you understand.
if it was completed, it wasn't completed by me.
I do understand, and now I want to you to understand.
the grade is accurate.
everything's all right, I promise.
just keep working.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
not a problem. Mom's not here yet. Dad called.
how was Washington? - Muggy.
you okay?
tired.
but you had a good time?
relatively.
mom. - Hi, honey.
Spencer, I need to talk to you.
both of you.
this is gonna become public knowledge soon, but I wanted you to hear it from me first.
we've discussed this at the firm, and I've decided to defend Garrett Reynolds.
Why?
I spoke to his mother.
I know what it's like to have a child accused of something they didn't do.
the police have evidence.
maybe they do. I'd like to see what it is.
so you're doing this out of curiosity?
I'm doing this because everyone deserves a strong defense.
mom, he has a lawyer. - I know his public defender.
Hector is competent to handle you for disturbing the peace, but he's out of his league with this.
he couldn't even get a change of venue.
okay, then have somebody else do it.
there must be a hundred other lawyers who can.
I'm sure there are. I don't know any that would take the case pro Bono.
you're doing this for free?
that's very generous of you.
okay, so you talked to his parents. Have you spoken with Garrett?
Yes. I found his story to be credible.
what story is that?!
all I can say is that. He convinced me of his lack of guilt as pertains to the charges.
mom... What are you doing?
okay? This is the man who killed my best friend.
he killed the girl that Emily was in love with. - Accused of killing them.
will you say something?
what do you want me to say?
this does involve you.
any interest I had in any of this ended three months ago.
Yeah. I'm pretty sure that's what she was telling me.
why would she do that? - I don't know.
she feels sorry for me? Everybody feels sorry for me?
it's not just you.
my mom's protective instincts have been in overdrive since the divorce.
she's... She's compensating.
well, I just wish she'd compensate on somebody else.
at least it's not "A" messing with your grades, right?
no, but it's a secret, and "A" attracts secrets like a mean girl magnet.
and that mean girl is locked up at Radley. This is somebody else.
somebody who digs up graves.
I can't believe that we are talking about "A."
I thought we were done with this when they grabbed Mona.
we're right back in the same place.
no, we're not.
you're right.
it's different.
listen, we did not go through all of that. To crawl under somebody else' s thumb.
I am way more angry than I am scared now.
can I borrow some of that?
any time.
when you tell mom, be accurate.
this is my second, not including lunch.
that's none of my business.
that is correct.
I do want to ask you something, though.
how do you really feel about mom defending Garrett?
how I feel? I'm completely indifferent.
Yeah, I don't really buy that.
I think that somehow you convinced her to do it.
why would I do that? - I don't know.
but I know that you and he got awfully tight just before he was arrested.
you have a lurid imagination.
my imagination is nothing compared to the facts, Melissa.
you were on that video in Ali' s bedroom, and when he walked out of that bedroom, he killed someone.
will you just stop?
for once in your life stop trying to be the smartest person in the room.
climb out of Spencer world long enough to see.
some people have lost everything everything.
Melissa... When you called back in June from the hospital, when you...When you were there, I asked mom if I could come up and see you. I Did.
and she said no.
I didn't want to see anybody else.
I woke up in that room a hundred Miles from here... And I knew something was wrong.
I just wanted mom.
I'm sorry you lost your baby.
you know, I hope she does get him off... Guilty or not.
Why? - Because of all the men I've had to deal with, he is the only one who's always told me the truth.
I figured it out too late, but I figured it out.
am I putting you to sleep?
No! No, no, no. I... I'm just a little rusty on this part.
we can take a break.
okay.
so, how's Emily?
when I hear her, she sounds strong, but, um, it's hard to tell when you can't see her face.
she's fine. Like you said, she's strong.
but the heart can only take so much... the heart and the mind.
case in point, poor little Mona.
it's a little hard to think of her as "poor little Mona" under the circumstances.
Yeah, I suppose.
the circumstances worked out well for you, didn't they?
it's not that tidy. Somebody did open Alison's grave.
but no one thinks that you had anything to do with that.
do they?
I bet those cookies are cool enough now.
you need any help?
no, I can manage.
a - Earplugs? - That's what it said.
okay, tomorrow's Wednesday. - If it means this week.
I wish people would be more specific with their clues.
I'll put it in the suggestion box. - What do we do about this?
I want to know where Jenna is tomorrow at 4: 15.
she asked about you, Em. - What did she want to know?
how you were holding up.
she wants to know if you can remember being in the car with her.
she just can't come out and say it. - This is crazy.
it's like trying to read a book and someone keeps ripping out the pages.
em, we'll put it together, all right?
Yeah. We know that somewhere between being with us and getting to Alison's grave, you were with Jenna.
we just have to find out how you got in the car and where you went, and we'll be that much closer to figuring out what happened that night.
mom. Hey.
have you spoken to your mom?
Yeah. She gave a prepared statement.
and then she declined to answer any questions.
why is she doing this? - Melissa made her do it.
I know. I just... I don't know why.
is she afraid of something Garrett could say?
I had a thought about Garrett and Melissa.
what kind of thought?
a pretty nasty one.
okay, now you have to say it.
what if Garrett and Melissa got together?
I mean, he went to the hospital with her to get her ultrasound.
where are you going with this?
I'm saying, what if Ian's not the father of Melissa's baby?
wait. If Garrett got Melissa pregnant, why wouldn't she marry him?
well... My parents might not have liked Ian, but he still had it over a civil servant.
Garrett was talking about medical records... We though he was talking about Jenna's.
Jenna's medical records wouldn't have changed your mother's mind, but...Melissa's...
so, my mom can't drive me to Philadelphia tomorrow.
he has to speak with the vice-principal.
about what?
I-I don't know. She didn't say.
there was a time when a man would have wait weeks for a rejection to come by mail.
now the Internet delivers big, concentrated blobs of disappointment with the click of a mouse.
so... there's no point in me coming over there.
and trying to make you feel better?
no, but... It's important to keep up appearances.
what?
have you ever helped out a student?
is that a trick question?
well, like, they underperformed on a test or something, but you knew that they knew the information, so you helped out their grade a little bit.
I get the feeling this isn't a hypothetical discussion.
Emily thinks that my mom helped her... Changed her grade on a test.
did Emily talk to your mother about this? - Yes.
and my mom basically said that that's what she did.
well, what you think?
I...I think that my mom's been through a lot.
my stuff and you-and-me stuff, and all that on top of a divorce?
I can see why she'd want to help out Emily.
you don't look surprised.
surprised that your mother would want to help a student? No.
the vice-principal wants to talk to my mom about this.
are they gonna fire her?
I drink a lot of water.
my mouth is always really dry. It's the pills.
really dry. So I drink a lot of water.
sort of like a cleanse. Do you want some water?
um, no. No, I'm fine, thank you.
me too.
you seem really different from the last time I was here.
they changed what I was taking.
what I'm taking now is different.
but it makes my mouth really dry.
and they won't let you have gum.
what is the deal with that?
so, do you have many visitors? - My parents.
mostly they just sit and look at me like they don't quite know who I am.
awkward.
but even when I was quiet, I knew you were here.
it helped. Really.
I mean, let's be honest, we've had our ups and downs, and I've had to forgive myself for a lot of that.
but how are you, Hanna banana?
what's the news of the boulevard?
I'm not here to talk about the boulevard. Or the water, or the gum, all right?
we thought you being in here was the end of it, and it's not.
and you know that.
the question is, how do you know?
Oh... I'm sorry somebody's giving you such a hard time.
you have to be so careful these days.
it's like you can't trust anybody. Not even family.
but don't worry. You'll always have me.
I'm not gonna forget any of you.
so, tell me, did they ever find what's left of Alison?
hello.
hello.
so you've discovered my other office.
this is where I see some of the students that I've started tutoring.
are we going to have a turf war?
no, no, I don't think so.
I want to talk to you about Emily.
Emily talks to Aria, and Aria talks to you.
that's our brave new world.
why does Hackett want to talk to you?
it's nothing for you to be concerned about.
I'm not just a spectator here.
he wants to ask me about my grading practice.
okay. Why?
the office received a note from a student who thinks I might be showing favoritism... Altering test scores.
which student? - It was anonymous.
I've done a very foolish. And shortsighted thing.
you did a very human thing.
how are you gonna handle it?
I'm going to handle it the way that Emily handled it when she found out...I'm going to tell the truth. Or... I could blame you.
maybe if you'd come into the classroom a little bit earlier, I wouldn't have done it.
that's an interesting approach, but if it works for you, go for it.
you know, with everything else going on in my life, I thought I was okay at work... That I had perspective.
I was wrong.
it's not easy to keep things separate.
no, it's not.
are you following me? - No.
that would mean I didn't know where you were going, and I was pretty sure of that.
do you want a ride back to town?
I thought that we had a deal about you not coming out here.
why can't you just trust me on this?
I do trust you, okay? I just don't want you coming out here to visit madhouse Mona.
do not call her that. - I call 'em like I see 'em.
there is another Mona in there...
the one I grew up with, the one who stuck with me, not the one who tore up your letter or tortured my friends. And ran me over with a car.
whoa, whoa, spool back.
when did she hit you with a car?
she is the one that ran you over?
no. You know what, I went over the car, not under it.
why didn't you say something? - What was I supposed to tell you?
the truth? - You make it sound like it's so easy.
you want to know the truth, well, boom! Here it is.
it's like a big bowl of spaghetti that's all tangled.
have you ever untangled spaghetti? - No.
well, there you go.
Hey, you know what, I need to talk to you. - About what?
you were visiting Mona. - Maybe.
I could have a lot of emotionally disturbed friends.
I saw you go in the day room.
okay, fine. I was visiting Mona. So what?
Why? Same reason you've been visiting her...
to see if she's really mental. - That's not why I'm here.
no? You didn't even consider that she might be faking?
that was pretty stupid, Hanna.
why would she be faking it? - Better than going to jail.
and safer. - Safer for who?
it's better for a lot of people if Mona stays crazy. Right?
what time is it?
uh, four o'clock.
do you think Cobb is coming to her, or is she going to him, her, whatever.
I couldn't tell from the note. It just said "Cobb, 415," and "earplugs."
earplugs?
I do not need things to get any weirder.
Hi. My name is Melissa Hastings, and I was an emergency room patient there back in June.
I was just wondering if I could get a copy of my records.
for the insurance company.
Mail' ll connect you to patient services. - Thank you.
Ezra knows what your mom did?
we danced around it a bit, but he finally came out and said it.
I wish I had a teacher like that. - Hanna.
this is a bad thing. My mom needs this job.
sorry! She was just trying to help out poor em.
Yeah, I think poor em is getting a little tired of being called "poor em."
are you sure? It would have been June tenth.
I was staying at the Hanover, and then I came in through the E.R.
it was a miscarriage.
I'm sorry, miss Hastings, we have no record of you being in this facility.
well, I was.
I-I might have given you my husband's name, Thomas.
could you look that up? It's the same social security number.
just a moment.
I should have just come out and asked him.
Lucas, you were at the masquerade with Jenna. Who were you talking to?
who was the black swan?
you would have asked him that in front of Caleb?
I couldn't make things worse with Caleb if I tried.
well, has he asked you anything else about Mona?
about the hit-and-run or anything?
no. He didn't say a word the whole drive back to town.
honestly, I think he's scared to ask me anything.
no Hastings, no Thomas... I'm sorry, there's no record of you being here.
well, I... suppose I might have gone to another hospital.
if you were staying at the Hanover, this is where they would have sent you.
the next closest emergency room is three towns over.
thank you.
I guess we're going for a ride.
Hanover resort. Good afternoon.
Hi. My name is Melissa Hastings, and I was a guest at your resort this summer.
I have a question about my bill.
I can help you with that. Let me pull it up.
so my credit card statement shows me leaving on June tenth.
does that match your records?
miss Hastings, I show you staying three days beyond the tenth.
are you sure? - I have restaurant and spa charges. As well as the additional room.
additional room? - For Veronica Hastings, arriving June tenth.
you used the same credit card for both rooms.
and check out together on the thirteenth.
the thirteenth.
Emily... What are you doing here?
I'm gonna talk to the vice-principal with you.
no. No, you're not. This was my misjudgment, not yours.
tell me you would have done this for anybody else.
that's not the point.
Mrs. Montgomery, I'm really grateful that you did this, but you don't know what you've done.
Mrs. Montgomery, look who came back for a visit.
Mrs. Montgomery. Emily.
Mr. Fitz. - Ezra.
uh, Mr. Hackett, you wanted to see me.
I did, but the matter has been resolved.
it has? I told Mr. Hackett about my going to your class. After Emily's makeup test.
I guess I just got a little overinvested in being your tutor.
happens to the best of us.
I also confessed to getting you to grade her test in front of me.
to see how she did, and I realized that might look like
I was trying to get her preferential treatment.
nonsense. Just a little professional courtesy.
to help the system work better.
well, anyway, I feel better getting it off my conscience.
a medical building?
all this for a crummy doctor's appointment?
Seriously? What a rip.
let's just go over there, look at the directory, and see what kind of doctor Dr. Cobb is.
give her a minute to get out of the lobby, then we'll go.
look.
Oh, my God, it's Jenna!
call Spencer and em!
Spence, call Emily, tell her we're following Jenna.
you know, you'd think I would have remembered.
this thing owes me a lot of quarters.
when did you become friends with Arthur Hackett?
I'm not, but I know how much he hates conflict.
almost as much as he hates making a decision, so I thought if I offered him a way out, he'd take it.
and he did.
Yeah.
so now we've both lied for Emily.
Yeah. Some role models we are.
and why did you do this?
this has nothing to do with Aria and me, if that's what you're thinking.
then why? - Because I knew why you did what you did.
I'm a teacher.
and we used to be friends.
thank you for the soda.
she went in there.
a gunstore? What is she doing at a... frickin' gun store?!
Duh. Can you say "target practice"?
that's the car, isn't it?
that's the one.
Spence, did you call the hospital?
Yeah, I called.
are they... are they sending the records?
there aren't any records. - What's that supposed to mean?
it means that Melissa didn't lose her baby in June.
there she is.
Hanna, stop. Stop.
no, Spencer, I'm sick of this.
we're lying to everybody, everybody's lying to us... no mas.
Han... you... - Let her go.
wow, Jenna. What a sight for sore eyes.
my Uncle Ned taught me solitaire.
he said as long as I had a deck of cards, I'd never be bored.
but I like klondike the best.
I like the way it looks. Don't you?
Yeah.
you're big on games. - It helps pass the time.
till what?
maybe I believe this, and maybe I don't... But get this straight...Do not mess with Hanna.
that is the one thing that I came here to say, and I've said it.
you two make a lovely couple.
you're laughing at all of us in there, in your head.
aren't you?
well, here's the real joke.
I get to walk out of that door.
but you... Aren't going anywhere.
you... are a lousy kisser.
No! No! No! No!
No! No! No! No! No!
all this time you could see. From the very first operation.
Yes.
how could you lie about this?
it was the only protection I had. - Protection from what?
someone tried to burn down our house with me in it, remember?
if people think that you're blind, they get careless.
you see what they don't think you can see.
and you never told Toby.
he was safer if he didn't know.
God, you are so twisted.
I wonder how I got that way?
I was in your car that night.
Yes, you were. - Where were you going?
I was just driving.
you think I enjoyed carrying that cane?
at least at night I could get out of town, get out of rosewood, and not worry about anybody seeing me.
Yeah, but somebody did see you.
dead of night, edge of town, and Emily was just standing there...In the middle of the road. I almost hit her.
you were drunk and crying, talking about Maya.
I couldn't just leave you there.
Yeah, she might tell someone she saw you.
witnesses can be a bitch.
she was so messed up that I thought that she wouldn't remember, and if she did, who would believe her?
so I put you in the car and I was going to take you home, at least to the end of your street, but you freaked out when I stopped at the light and jumped out of the I couldn't take any more chances.
what time was this?
about twelve, twelve-thirty.
you have to promise not to tell.
that you can see? - Are you kidding?
I am still a target. - For who?
if I knew that, then I wouldn't have to hide.
you have to do this for me!
I mean, you owe it to me, right?
all of you.
hello. - Oh, hello, honey.
what's all this?
Hector sent everything over from the public defender's office.
I was right. Once they had Garrett in custody, they went through every open case they had looking for a hook.
and they found some.
Yeah, enough to charge him with arson and with killing Maya.
it's mostly circumstantial.
and knowing the way the Rosewood police handle evidence, I'm sure I can get everything thrown out.
I'm so glad you're enjoying yourself.
he's innocent until proven guilty.
that is so good, mom. Did you come up with that yourself?
you can't speak to me like that, Spencer.
I'm sorry. No matter how we feel, we can't let this man be railroaded by a sloppy investigation.
you know what, mom? I've been doing some investigating of my own, and do you know what I found?
when Melissa was alone in Hanover. And she got sick and she lost her baby, she didn't go to a hospital.
there were no records. She just stayed at the resort.
which is where you went to go meet her.
did Melissa tell you this?
No! Mom, Melissa wouldn't tell me if my hair was on fire!
she went up there looking pregnant, and you brought her back down not pregnant.
she was faking. So did you know that before you went up to see her?
is that why I wasn't allowed to come?
I didn't know before I got there.
I had some suspicions, but I didn't know.
you had some suspicions?
mom, when did Melissa lose her baby?
you'll have to ask your sister.
no, mom, I am asking you.
Hey. I was just about to get something to drink.
how about you? - In a minute.
I need to talk to you.
it was bad enough when Mrs. Montgomery finished that test for me, but now she has you lying about it.
Mrs. Montgomery had nothing to do with that.
that was completely my idea. - Why?
no. Don't tell me. I know.
you felt sorry for me.
that's not what I need from my teachers. - You're right.
and I don't think you would have done it if you weren't with Aria.
I've been thinking a lot about that, and honestly, I don't know if I would have.
I do know you got caught in the middle of something, and I'm sorry if Ella and I made things worse instead of better.
Yeah. I hate to sound ungrateful, but I am really getting tired of everybody treating me like I was made out of glass.
same course, different test.
pass it now.
I'll get your usual.
there was a hoodie watching us.
what if "A" put Garrett's mom in the hospital to get Garrett out of jail?
I'm done, Hanna. - Are you breaking up with me?
aka
Spencer, you were right. I'm withdrawing the reward.
the truth always comes out, Jason.
meet me in the parking lot in 15 minutes.
we know that somewhere between being with us and getting to Alison's grave, you were with Jenna.
we just have to find out what happened that night.
my boss volunteered the bank staff to help out at a rummage sale at the church.
em, I just found the gray jacket from that night.
it just came out of a donation box.
are you here without an assistant?
if you know anyone who's interested... - I'm interested.
he's writing a note for the flowers.
his mom is in a coma. She's not doing a lot of reading.
Hanna, slow down.
you almost tripped over a catheter back there that was still attached to someone.
312, 312...
there it is.
we need to have a plan.
we have a plan. Exposing "A.
inside voice. - Okay.
what is the plan exactly?
we're going to replace Garrett's note with a fake note that we wrote.
I know that part. I came up with it, remember?
I was wondering why you were asking me that.
but we still need a place to lead "A.
rosewood church, by the organ in the main sanctuary, tonight.
how did you come up with that?
I have been living there since my mom signed me up to sort through spandex shorts and granny panties.
but won't the church be locked?
that's the point. It's deserted at night.
so when Lucas shows up... - it's not gonna be Lucas!
Yes, it will, han, he had the pills. - Fine!
then I'll show up with a paddle and finish what I started at the lake.
what happened to the girl who wouldn't get out of her sweats?
she traded them for fatigues. I'll write that.
are you sure you know how? - Yes.
I've been forging my mom's signature since seventh grade in p. E.
this is really good.
yell if you see anyone, all right?
are you sure that you want to do it?
this "A" broke me and Caleb up, do you understand?
they're gonna have to pay for that.
Mrs. Reynolds?
blue team to I. C.U. Blue team to I. C.U.
go! Go! Go go go! Come on!
blue team to I. C.U. Blue team to I. C.U.
aka
it's on the border it's the first exit.
Yeah, I found it.
why aren't you going with Laurel?
she's just weird about driving with strangers.
you're not a stranger, you're her assistant.
what's up?
laurel was just double-checking that I had the right address.
how bad do you think it would be if I canceled?
canceled on your first day of work?
I don't think you'd get a second.
Yeah. That's what I figured.
I don't understand. Why would you want to do that?
I thought you were excited about this job.
I am. I really am. It's just...
Hanna's still really torn up over Caleb, so we were all gonna get together tonight to try and cheer her up.
your friends know it's a great opportunity for you.
besides, we gotta pool our resources together.
I think we're on our last package of ramen.
what is this really about?
you wouldn't have been hired if she didn't think you were up to the task.
Hey, look up. - Don't.
boom. - Ezra, seriously.
okay, your turn. - What?
I want to remind you that you know what you're doing.
so come on, take a picture of me.
are you happy?
no. Keep going.
the thinker.
gorgeous. Okay, come on. You gotta give me something else.
running in place? - You gotta give me more.
so I went and showed her the place, and she said she loved it.
I think I did a good job.
once I finish putting the beams in the loft, she said they'd be interested for them. Ng some custom work that's great.
she even gave my name to an architect she knows.
aka
that... that's great.
Spencer. You're doing it again.
I'm sorry.
I know that I've been a little bit distracted recently.
I just... I have so much on my plate.
I have this project that's due on Monday... - okay. Okay.
I'll let you work. - Thank you.
I'll just sit next to you and I'll watch you type.
I'll be very quiet.
okay.
I...
that's not...Distracting at all.
just do you know.
Hi! Dad! How was your run?
it was fine.
I miss the days when you ran with me.
I guess...I guess I'll take off.
I'll call you later, okay?
Where's mom?
she, uh, had to work today.
on what case? - She got called in early.
time-sensitive issue.
dad, you didn't answer my question.
don't needle me, Spencer. I'm not the one working on it.
so it is Garrett's case.
I know how crazy you get about this stuff.
so what happened?
I shouldn't have brought it up. - I brought it up.
you're gonna read about it in the papers anyway.
turns out the physical evidence that the police had on Garrett Reynolds, well, it... It can't be re-tested.
why not?
they either don't have enough of it or what they do have has been tainted.
something along those lines.- Why do they even have to re-test it?
if it tested positively the first time...
all I know is that your mother is pushing for the judge to rule the evidence inadmissible, and it looks like she's gonna get what she wants. As usual.
but if they can't use it...
isn't the prosecution relying on this evidence?
without it they won't have a case!
that's what your mother's hoping.
where are you going? - Out!
Thanks.
Hey. Did you get my text?
I haven't had time to sneeze.
how'd it go? Did Spence replace the note? - No. I did it.
but you're scared of old people.
Yeah, and apparently they're scared of me too.
I touch the woman and she nearly croaked.
what happened? - Look, I came to give you this.
it's the pick-up location of the bag that your jacket came from.
is this even in rosewood?
no, but I thought we'd go tomorrow and check it out.
why not today?
because after you're done working we're going straight to the church.
meet me at home? - Yeah, I'll see you later.
so what's up?
I need to talk to you about Garrett. His case.
then you know... about the evidence.
so it has been thrown out?
not yet, but it will be.
look, I think I might have a way to make sure that Garrett's case doesn't fall apart.
but I'm at a dead end, and at this point the only person who might be able to help me is you.
what can I do?
do you know somebody named April rose?
so you've never heard of her?
would you believe I used to wear a pair just like these?
with a suede French vest.
wanted to look like cat Stevens.
well, if find a hat with a squirrel tail on it, I'll let you know.
um, that's Davey Crockett, and I'd be wearing a raccoon cap.
looks like you've got an interesting system going.
Oh. Yeah, I'm organizing them into seasons.
we have fall, winter, spring, summer...
resort. - Oh. How innovative.
is your mom coming today?
no, she can't. She had to take the car in.
well, I guess I'll see you at the party tonight.
what party?
I made an announcement about it like 15 minutes ago.
the council throws it for the volunteers as a way of saying thanks.
well, thanks but no thanks. I'm busy.
too bad. You haven't partied until you've partied in the church rec room.
wait.
the... the party's tonight?
here? At the church?
wanna change your plans now, don't you?
but to be honest, there were so many girls hanging around us at the time
I could have met her and not even known it.
and by "us," you mean...
Garrett, Ian and I.
right. The n. A.T. Club. - How'd you know about that?
do you think that she could have been one of the girls that you filmed?
well, I didn't film any of those videos.
Yeah, but you watched them. Didn't you?
how did you get that honor without doing any of the grunt work?
it was my idea.
look, like I said before, I was messed up.
high school was just one big blur.
do you think she could have been in one of the videos?
it's possible.
or maybe she was just one of their "employees.
what does that mean?
I think Ian and Garrett were paying girls to set up their friends.
I don't know. At that time I had kind of walked away from it all.
so were you guys the only members?
officialy Yeah. But Ian had help.
there's no way he could have filmed it all on his own.
at times, I even thought maybe he was filming it for someone else.
I'll catch up with you later. - Yeah.
Hey, ezra, I'm gonna have to run.
wait... right this minute?
not so fast. At least give me a proper goodbye.
Bye.
Bye.
I can't believe you asked him that.
we have to find this girl, and if anybody knows who she is, it's Jason.
well, he doesn't.
he might not have recognized her name, but he could recognize her by a picture.
I wonder if April was the type of girl who pimped out her friends.
I don't know. All I know is that the prosecution's case is crumbling, and we have to get to this girl before "A" does.
whatever Garrett wants destroyed could be the only thing left that keeps him in jail.
do you think Maya found those tapes with Ali's stuff?
it's possible. Maybe that's what Garrett was after all along.
maybe April rose has a tape.
maybe that's what Garrett wants "A" to destroy.
what I don't get is why would "A" take direction from Garrett?
it might be the other way around.
Garrett might have done whatever "A" told him to and that's how he wound up behind bars.
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
finally. I'm starving. - Me too.
do you want to split some cheese fries? - No, I want my own.
so, the plan's changed for tonight.
it's not a plan, it's a suicide mission.
the church is gonna be crawling with people, so we're not gonna be able to figure out who "A" is.
Emily and I are gonna hide behind the organ and just see who shows up.
I don't think that you should...
Spencer, it's not about confronting, okay?
I just want to see who it is so I'll know how to plan a real attack.
we." When we attack.
just be careful. And wear sensible shoes.
Hey, I wear three inches or I wear nothing.
Oh, and order me a side salad. To soak up the cheese.
what's with you? You're acting like a pod person.
Oh. I...I was just trying to remember how much reward money Jason offered.
$50, 000. Why?
and that was cash, right? - Yeah.
did he just have all that money lying around his house?
well, I doubt it.
but if someone did, would that be weird?
if you had that much cash lying around, you'd probably also have a bomb shelter and like five years' worth of dehydrated meat.
or you're a criminal.
I do want my own cheese fries.
need to talk to you. It's about Spencer.
Jason. Please, leave her out of this.
I need her energy focused on her future, not this trial.
maybe you should tell your wife that.
Jason, you're wrong about Veronica.
she didn't take this case out of spite. She doesn't hate you.
well, no, I don't think she hates me. I think she hates you.
look...
I don't want my daughter's life derailed any further.
she needs to find a way to, you know, put this behind her.
the trial, your sister...
which sister exactly are you talking about?
because as it turns out, I had more than one.
finally. Let's go.
Hey, let me introduce you to the art of conversation.
Hi! How was your day?
my day was fine. How was yours?
I'm sorry. I just want to leave.
I should say hi to Ted.
uh, can we not? That goober is literally trying to be my best friend.
Hanna, being kind and decent doesn't make Ted a "goober.
I know. It's the fact that he says "howdy"and wears clothes made of roadkill.
what is up with you?
well, now that you mention it, I'm goober's date tonight.
what? When did this happen?
he called this morning. - And you said yes?!
no. Mom. I... I'm sorry, you can't go.
why not?
because I'm going to be there, and that'll be weird.
Hanna, you're not ten years old, we don't need to hold hands.
but I thought it might be nice if we could drive together.
no, we can't, because...Toby's picking me up.
he's taking me to the dance.
why is Spencer's boyfriend taking you to the dance?
is this about you wanting to hurt Caleb?
no, it's...
there's this... Guy, another volunteer, and he just won't take no for an answer, so I thought if I take Toby, then maybe he'll finally leave me alone.
is this something I should be concerned about?
no. He's just some do-gooder creep. He's harmless.
it's actually called "the thank you dance"?
who cares what it's called, Spencer.
can you get Toby to come with me or not?
han, it's bad enough that I canceled a date with him without forcing him to go on one with you.
I don't want him involved.
involved? He just has to stand there and eat chips.
I don't understand though. Why couldn't you just come up with a better lie?
I'm sorry. I panicked, all right?
it was like my mouth was talking before my brain could catch up.
you can make fun of me all you want, but this whole plan is falling apart!
you don't think that I'm taking this seriously?
I've spent every waking moment searching for this April girl.
I've been in the library so much I am on a first-name basis with the homeless guy that sleeps next to the microfiche.
what is this? - Police academy rosters.
I thought maybe April and Garrett went through training together.
you think that another cop could help him get away with murder?
like wilden?
I don't know.
han, I thought that we were done with all this.
Yeah, me too.
you know, last year...
when things got really bad I used to fantasize about what my life would be like if I had never met Ali.
my biggest concern right now would be where I wanted to go to college.
I've had that fantasy too.
Yeah, but every time I go down that road,
I have to remind myself that if I hadn't met her, then I wouldn't be friends with you.
so what time should Toby pick you up?
seven-thirty.
okay. Now go, so I can keep looking through all this.
we'll get there, okay?
we've stopped Mona, and we can stop this person.
it's now or never.
I know. It's the "never" part that I'm afraid of.
more coffee? - I'm done, thanks.
she don't look so good. Better get her home before she passes out.
found April rose.
did you talk to her? - It's not a "her.
it's an "it.
aka
you want some punch?
Oh, no thank you.
I don't drink anything that's not shrink-wrapped.
so who am I here to scare off?
what? The creep that's been bothering you...?
Oh! Right. Um...
Yeah, it's that guy over there.
Hi, sweetie. - Hey.
Hi, Toby. - Hi, Ms. marin.
Toby, this is Ted.
Howdy. - Nice to meet you.
you too. - You're a very lucky man.
What?! No. No, we're... we're not... um, yeah.
we're just friends.
what do you say we try to find the grown-up beverages?
don't kill the messenger, but they're not serving alcohol.
Oh. Right. Church.
maybe we should find someone with a beard who can do that whole turning-water-into-wine thing.
if not, would you settle for a root beer?
do you think it will ferment if we let it stand long enough?
Toby, come on.
Hi. - Good evening.
good evening, folks. I'm getting ready to close.
how can I help you?
we just came in to pick up something that might have been set aside?
were you asked to hold anything? - Half this shop.
but I'm not holding my breath anybody's coming back.
well, you see, a friend of ours dropped something off and asked us to pick it up.
but we don't know exactly what it is, and our friend can't be reached.
okay, so we can go classic with "when Harry met Sally,
we can watch "the notebook" for, like, the millionth time.
I don't care. You can decide.
that's really pretty.
don't you love finding new places to wear jewelry?
I'm never taking it off.
who gave it to you? - No one special.
just another one of the nameless, faceless revolving door of boyfriends who adore you?
no. Just a friend.
I...Am going out.
are you kidding?
my friend has a guy who can get us I. D.'S.
I'm going to a party to pick him up, and then I'll be back.
this is so typical.
every time we make plans, if something better comes along, you totally ditch me.
why are you spazzing? I'm making sure we have the best summer ever.
instead of languishing at the kiddie table, we'll be mixing up on futons with frat boys.
I gotta go. My friend's here.
which friend? - You don't know her.
you're sure this is it? - I'm positive. She never took it off.
uh, how much do you want for this?
I don't know. I've never seen that before.
I just found it on this mannequin.
must have been brought in here in the past couple of days.
and you don't happen to know who dropped it off?
it's...
there's no code, no tags.
I can't sell it to you folks. It's a display piece.
how about if I give you a hundred dollars?
it's not my decision to make.
will two hundred make it your decision?
four hundred.
Hi. - Where are you?
I'm sorry, I got held up.
well, get here. I can't face "A" alone.
Toby's getting suspicious, and wilden is hovering.
Wilden's there? Okay, I'm leaving in five.
here you are.
do you want to dance?
no, thanks.
all right, then.
wait. Toby.
when you reach the summit, all you can hear is the wind whistling through the rocks.
sounds... Incredible.
I'd love to take you.
if... You're interested.
how about next Sunday?
well, Sunday's kind of a busy day for me.
okay. Sunday after that?
Ah, the thing is, I'm busy every Sunday.
I thought Hanna must have told you. I'm a pastor?
well, an associate pastor.
no. She didn't.
more root beer? - Yeah.
Hanna... Why am I here?
I told you. That guy...
I know, you told me. But that kid is scared of his own shadow, and he's definitely scared of yours. So why am I here?
why are you?
I told you. I wanted to go to a party.
Hanna, I have had naps more exciting than this party, and so have you.
does this have to do with Caleb? - No.
in a way.
Hanna. I need to talk to you for a second. Now.
I'm really sorry, Toby. I'll be right back, okay?
Hey. Can you call me?
I'm about to leave this church... Thing.
and I need to know why you and Hanna lied to me.
why didn't you tell me Ted was a pastor?
he is?
Hanna, I have just replayed the last hour in my head, and I am this close to crawling under a pew.
Oh, my gosh. You really like him.
it's too late. I blew it.
no, you didn't.
I made that joke about them not serving booze.
you like your wine. - I wore a dress with cleavage!
mom, that is practically a turtleneck.
Hanna, all it takes is one glance at my resume to know that I am no angel.
who is?
Hey, holden.
so, uh, is your whole crew coming tonight?
no. Just me and Hanna. Have you seen her?
Yeah, she's, uh...Around here somewhere.
Hey, relax. Have a cupcake.
when did you get that tattoo?
Oh, it's not a...
is that for a club?
not a club so much as a party.
it changes venues.
you know, I...actually, I used to see your friend there sometimes.
W-what friend?
your girlfriend? - Maya?
Hey, I gotta go.
Oh, there you are.
sorry. Just wanted to check on Hanna.
and how is she? - She's good.
so, do you want to dance?
I'd love to, but word of warning, my dance moves start at "the running man" and end at the "Roger rabbit.
Hey, there, Ashley.
pastor. - Detective wilden, right?
that's right, but I'm off the clock.
so am I. It's Ted.
I'm happy to see you here, if a little surprised.
that's funny, I was just about to say the same thing to Ms. marin.
you two know each other?
sure. We haven't seen each other in a while.
detective wilden was an important part of the Alison dilaurentis case.
Hanna was a good friend of hers. So our paths have crossed.
and they'll probably cross again.
anyway, have a good evening.
now, where were we?
Oh, that's right. I was just about to humiliate myself on the dance floor.
I'm sorry, Ted. I just got hit with a searing headache.
can I get you some aspirin?
no.
then maybe we should sit down for a little...
thank you...I think I should just go home.
uh, sure. Let me walk you to the car.
Hey, can you call me? I'm about to leave this church... Thing.
and I need to know why you and Hanna lied to me.
Hey. How did it go?
as well as it could, I guess.
I told 'em I got an anonymous tip and they seemed to believe me.
so when will we know when...
he didn't say.
what do we do now? - Now we wait.
do you still have those letters?
the ones that helped you figure out that my dad is our dad.
Yeah. - May I see them?
Oh, Spencer. You don't want to do that.
it'll just.Hurt.
what?
nothing. I was...
just thinking about how different you are from Ali.
I mean, the reason that you don't want me to see them is the very reason that she would want me to.
I wonder what kind of person she would have turned into.
I mean, I see it with the kids I work with, and at first they're all attitude, but you peel back the layers and you usually find a person underneath.
Yeah, but with Ali, I'd keep peeling, I just...
always seemed to find new layers.
Emily. Where have you been?
I just had the weirdest conversation with holden.
what? When were you with...
I remembered something from that night, and it might have something to do with Maya.
Holden seemed to know, but he walked away.
well, let's find him. - I don't know where he went.
just go wait by the side door, okay? I want to get there before "A" does.
don't lie to me, Hanna.
a nurse found this, and wisely handed it over to the police.
I don't know what that is.
don't tell me you're here for some peace and quiet.
I was looking for someone. - Who?
why are you helping him?
I don't know who you're talking about yeah, you do, but I'll play along.
all that fuss you girls made, pointing the finger at Ian.
was that all for Garrett's sake? - I have nothing to do with that.
I don't get it, Hanna. Why are you in his corner?
my mom's downstairs. - Your mom left.
you know, I bet when she was your age she caused a lot of problems.
but... She knows how to get rid of problems.
all you do is create 'em.
I've gotta go.
there's people he has to answer to.
you always stand up for him, don't ya?
did everything go okay at work today?
Yeah.
no. Not at all, actually.
I dropped two light meters, I switched out a wrong lens and I punctured her mounts.
Really? - Yeah.
what happened?
well, I was a little distracted...
by what I found in your sock drawer.
it that why you ran out of here today?
I didn't know what to say.
I can see how that might look... Pretty bad.
Ezra, where did that money come from?
I sold a car my grandfather left me. A sixty-seven jag.
I was hoping to restore it one day, but now someone else has it and I have a sock drawer with no socks.
and they paid you in cash?
Yeah, I let the guy pay me in cash so he could have a break on taxes.
um, o-okay. Why didn't you just tell me that?
well, I didn't think you'd be going through my sock drawer.
I wasn't going through your sock drawer...
because it's embarrassing. Okay?
six months ago I was a Professor, and now I'm answering want ads for webzines and...
and reusing coffee filters.
can I join you?
when you're loyal to a man, hewie, you're loyal to everything about him...
even his faults...
even his son.
good morning.
is it?
I wanted to talk to you.
Yeah. I figured you and mom would want to have a chat.
your mom's already left.
an important piece of evidence in the Reynolds case was turned in last night.
but I imagine you already knew that.
now, Spence, the police have been looking for that anklet for two years.
I didn't know that.
they didn't tell the family, and they kept it out of the press.
but you and Jason managed to find it.
I don't know how, but there it is.
the anklet had trace amounts of blood still on it...
Alison's and someone else's.
that blood has been ruled out as belonging to Garrett Reynolds.
what... what do you mean?
they don't know whose it is, but they know it's not his.
that's... that's not possible.
Spencer, the judge threw out the case.
I'll take you to school.
we have new evidence in the DiLaurentis case, and we need you to come in for a blood sample.
my blood is not on your evidence. - Then why do you look so scared?
I spoke to your father this morning. - You're seeing him?
we made lunch plans. I guess I have you to thank for that.
move over! - Why?
because this never happened.
we found your vehicle near the scene of an accident.
we've been here all night, detective. I picked her up after work today.
is this yours? - There's still something in it.
I told the doctor how little I had to drink, and he wanted to do a tox screen...there were traces of milizopam in my system.
a code? - It's this stupid thing she made back when we were friends.
Maya's away, sleeping sweet...
until Garrett's all rosy, count on me.
I don't suppose crazy slipped you the password as well.
Mona's trying to help us. Why else would she give us this?
Emily's still on the phone.
she seemed to take it okay, didn't she?
what, like we should be used to hearing from ghosts by now?
Spencer, why can't you admit that she trying to help us?
Hanna, did you ever stop to think why Mona would want to help us?
because she's afraid of something...just like we were afraid of her.
I don't know. - Yeah, you don't know...
but the cops are still after my blood. - I told you, my mom will handle that.
I hate needles. - Okay, look...whether this if fake or not, we've got to figure out what's on that site.
it was Nate. - What did he want?
I promised to hike up with him to the old boat house.
told him it was Maya's favorite spot in Rosewood.
you're not... Gonna, like, tell him about this, are you?
if I did that, I'd have to tell him how we know about it.
em, what do you... want us to do about this?
do you mind if we try and break into Maya's site?
we have to.
okay. Um, well, - How do we get past the password? - It's just a password...there are ways of cracking it.
thought I had an idea of what it was.
guess I don't know her as well as I thought I did.
it's okay.
will you be home for dinner? - Yeah.
well, Mike's got a game, we'll be back by six.
if you could start the salad...
I can do that. - Good.
Meredith got the job.
the job at Rosewood high. - Yes.
are you gonna be okay with that?
well, who gets to tell mom?
I will tell your mother.
I gotta go.
home by six?
I'll start the salad.
I taught her how to make these little origami boats.
we'd come out here at night with paper and birthday candles, make them by the dozens...Then light the candles and watch them float away.
we used to do the same thing. With... Paper balloons.
air, water, fire...
Maya liked all the elements.
you see her all the time, don't you? - Almost.
in this place it's really strong.
your friend Jenna stood me up.
I'm sorry.
gave her a day to call and explain, - then I called her. - What did she say?
she said she was sorry, but a situation came up.
sounded like she thought she was through with someone, but she wasn't.
that happens.
weren't you scared to come out here at night?
I wasn't alone... I was with Maya.
I never understood how somebody could do that...kill somebody. Then I saw Garret in the hospital...
and I realized...Yeah... I could kill that guy...kill him with my bare hands. - It wouldn't change anything.
he'd be dead. It's a pretty big change.
don't talk like that, not here. Okay?
I didn't mean to scare you.
you didn't. - Good.
I wouldn't want you to be afraid of me.
okay, marine, drop and give me twenty!
hello. - Hello.
Aria, come in and meet my... mother.
it's such a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Fitz. - Fitzgerald.
Ezra likes to truncate the name for some reason, but call me Diane.
Diane. I'm Aria. - Yes, you are.
I'm so glad to finally meet the mysterious girl with the lyrical name.
mysterious? - Well, elusive.
Ezra' s kept you to himself all this time, I didn't want to pass up this opportunity.
there's a benefit at the Osgood museum, and my mother is honorary trail boss.
Oh, that's great. - Yes, it is.
there's a reception tomorrow night at the museum. I'd love it if you both could come.
that's kind of short notice, mom. - Indulge me.
I love the Osgood.
the women have you outnumbered.
okay. - Perfect.
I'll leave an invitation at the desk. So glad I caught you.
Oh, do you have to go? We can have some coffee.
actually, we've got that thing. Do you remember?
right. I completely forgot about that.
I don't want to disturb your Sunday. We'll talk tomorrow night.
well, it's nice to meet you. - You too.
I will see you tomorrow night. - Yeah. Bye.
"Fitzgerald," huh?
if you want to be a writer, you don't want an albatross like that around your neck.
right. And what if your last name was Hemingway?
then I would be Ezra Hem.
sounds like you're clearing your throat.
you know, you don't have to go to this thing tomorrow night if you don't want to.
are you kidding? I do. I mean, the Osgood and your mom?
did you notice how she never sat down? - I noticed her diamonds.
well, in the divorce she got custody the jewelry.
what does she know about us?
well... She knows that I love you.
that's a good start. What else?
I told her that we didn't start seeing each other until after I left Rosewood high.
you lied to your mother.
wasn't the first time.
I thought you said you can crack it. - I can, okay?
I just have not done it yet.
none of the regular work-arounds are working.
so when do you give up? - That is completely the wrong attitude.
I can't just whack at it with a stick!
okay, I think that I need help.
what kind of help?
I-I heard that Caleb was back from California.
I haven't seen him, but... Yeah, I know he's back.
he wouldn't even have to know what this was for.
I could just ask him for some tips on how to get around a tough password.
Yeah. You know what, go ahead.
at least one of us might be able to be in the same room as him.
okay. I'll talk to him tomorrow at school.
do you know where he is?
Hey, Toby. - Hanna.
where... Who is? - Jason.
um, can you... Wait upstairs?
we'll be finished in a couple minutes. - Yeah.
what do you mean,"where is he"?
I mean, I was just at his house and he's gone.
the house is locked, his car isn't in the garage.
OK. So maybe he's just out.
he's not driving around with a busted-up front end.
that car is evidence. He's not out, he's gone.
across the state line, paying cash to fix his car.
you covered for him, I covered for you, and you left us both lying to the cops.
I was just trying to protect him.
I think that you're the one that needs protection.
he's my brother, Toby. - And the people you really need protecting from are the ones you're related to. Before you talk to him, you're gonna listen to me.
Toby, please... - I'm not gonna ask you to explain anything, because you won't... you just say that I have to trust you.
Mona's locked up, Garrett is locked up...
but you still jump every time your phone rings.
it's... - I know, it's complicated.
so I'll make easy on you... I'll find out for myself.
Toby, please...
Hey. I rang the doorbell.
my folks are in Scranton.
haven't seen you at school.
I missed a few days.
are you okay?
I felt pretty bad for a while, but I'm better now.
okay, we have to talk about this. - No. We don't.
you got sick because you drank from my flask.
I have to explain who that happened, or at least try explain.
we can forget about the whole thing. Honestly, em.
you deserve to know the truth.
can we go someplace and talk?
I can't today.
tomorrow? After school?
please.
okay.
okay.
so what couldn't you tell me over the phone?
frankly, I shouldn't be telling you anything at all, you're not immediate family.
but I know how invested you are in Mona.
did something happen to her? - Not yet.
but they're gonna move her to a different facility. - Where?
near Saratoga. In New York. - No, they can't!
her attending physicians think she needs a more intense treatment program.
frankly, I think they're worried about liability more than Mona's health.
they want her under high security. - Why?
for one, Mona's outburst in the day room, and they realize she hasn't been taking all her meds.
they think she's been smuggling them out with a visitor.
what visitor? - Not you.
but Mona's surprisingly popular.
they can't send her away. What about her parents?
they're still in denial. They'll go along with whatever the board recommends.
well, talk the board out of it! - What?
talk them out of moving her.
tell them in your expert opinion you think she's gonna get much better right here in Rosewood.
my expert opinion might not mean much.
these are the men who wrote the textbooks. - I don't care about the books.
I can't promise anything, but I'll talk to them.
you can do it.
your confidence in me is bracing.
essentially misplaced, but bracing.
excuse me.
this is very impressive.
my mom doesn't use it much since the accident, so she let me take it.
you drove it back from California?
I have a lot of thinking to do. Driving helps.
Yeah. I get it.
um, listen, I have sort of an abstract computer question.
I was wondering if you could help me out with it.
what's the question?
I was wondering what's the best way to get around really tough password protection.
that's about as abstract as a brick wall.
Yeah, okay. Maybe we are talking about a real password.
maybe?
there's a particular site that I cannot get onto.
whose site is it?
what should I wear?
I have to look insanely sophisticated for this.
how about a... Hello Kitty T-shirt?
help me, please. This is Ezra' s mom.
so what's she like?
diamonds and Chanel on a Sunday morning.
I think you're in Spencer territory.
that's a good idea.
so, Ezra' s family has some money.
Yeah, his mom does.
what?
you just said he's been scrambling for work.
I have been with the boy who gets a fat allowance.
it's like having the parent on the date with you.
Yeah, but if he really needed help, don't you think he'd ask her?
if it is real, I have no idea how Mona got it.
but if it's fake, it's an insanely cruel thing to do to Emily.
I know that we've asked you to do something like this before, - So I get it if you don't... - No, I'll do it.
look, whatever happened, Hanna's important to me.
so if I have a chance to crush the Mona monster, I'm in.
after school? - Yeah, after school.
Mona's almost gone?
gone where?
the doctors at Radley want to send her to another hospital...
one with thicker bars. - How do you know that?
Wren told me. - He did?
what does he have to do with any of this?
he thought I should know, and he said that Mona's been passing her meds to a visitor.
Lucas? - You're saying that the pills that Aria found in his bag might be for Mona?
I don't know. Wren didn't tell me, so I didn't ask. - And Hanna's next.
I don't want to give anyone any of my blood. I need all I got.
my mom is handling it. - Wait a second.
if they send Mona away, we're not gonna find out why she gave us Maya's site.
if it really is Maya's site.
you're sure your mom can stop this court order on Hanna's blood?
what did you want to borrow?
I want something classy but not frumpy.
not that you have frumpy.
mom?
Spencer, she's gonna know you went through there.
I can get in and out without leaving a trace.
Ooh, jackpot.
Garrett's file?
Yeah. The works.
get out your phone. We're taking pictures.
that drug that made you sick...it didn't come from anybody at the party. It was in my flask.
you know that, don't you? - I guess I figured that out.
when I gave it to you, I didn't know it.
I swear, I would never do that to you.
but somebody did that you.
Yeah, somebody did it to me.
who? - I don't know.
do you know when it happened?
it was the night that somebody dug up Ali' s grave.
I drank from the flask and I lost time.
I was at Spencer' s, and then I wasn't at Spencer' s, and I'm trying to find out what happened to me.
you were with me. Part of that night... You were with me.
Maya wasn't just strangled. by a pipe or a metal bar. Or a policeman's nightstick.
lividity indicates the victim was killed at the scene.
lividity? - It's the way blood settles in the body when the heart stops.
it means that Maya was killed right there in Emily's backyard.
look at this.
Maya was killed the same night that Garrett was arrested at my house.
between 10 P.M. and 2 A.M.
which means that he had plenty of time to kill Maya and meet with Melissa.
poor Maya.
she was just out there in the backyard the whole time?
well, the tenants had moved out, and Emily hadn't moved back in.
the house was empty.
says that there was no personal property found at the scene.
so if she had a bag, somebody took it with them.
what's this? - The prosecution witness list.
look at that. - Bart Comstock?
break him and it falls apart.
my mom is gonna go after this guy.
he must know something or have seen something.
Yeah, something bad about Garrett.
and she thinks that if she can break him, she could win.
the address is in Rosewood. Do you want to go there?
Caleb's gonna be here any minute.
I'll go on my way home.
are you sure? - Mm-hmm.
I'm just gonna see what's there.
you're not gonna tell Caleb about these, are you?
no. It's strictly need to know.
okay, bye.
it was about eleven o'clock, I think. My folks were out.
I heard something on the front porch.
you were sitting on my steps.
you were drunk. I thought you were drunk.
do you remember me taking you into the house?
I don't remember.
I was holding you up.
then I wasn't holding you...
you were holding me.
you kissed me.
maybe you thought I was someone else,
I think I knew that, but I didn't stop you.
I didn't want to stop you. It was... Like a dream.
and then what happened?
the dream ended.
I went into the kitchen to get you a glass of water, and when I came back you were gone.
I tried to call your phone, but you didn't answer.
somebody called me at eleven.
then at school, I could tell you didn't remember. Or you didn't want to remember.
no, I didn't remember. I don't remember!
why wouldn't you have told me this sooner?
I convinced myself that what I did was okay. It wasn't.
you were there, and I just got... Greedy.
it was bad enough when I thought you were drunk, but when I found out about the flask, I felt... Worse than awful.
please, Emily, you have to understand, I didn't...
I'm afraid you're much more impressed with my opinion than the board.
I couldn't say anything to change their minds.
when do they send her away?
it's just a matter of paperwork now.
look, Hanna, we may have been going about this the wrong way.
I'm not the person to speak to them on Mona's behalf.
you are. - Me?
Yeah. You've been visiting her for months. You're her friend.
you want me to talk to a bunch of doctors?
not the whole board, just her primary physicians.
there's an advocacy hearing tonight.
explain it to them the way you explained it to me.
no. I can't talk to them the way I talk to you.
then you better be prepared to say good-bye to Mona.
Oh. We're not open.
first show's at six-thirty.
Oh. I was just coming by for a schedule for the film festival.
sure. Yeah.
some... Great stuff coming up.
lots of that's not on DVD. - Thanks.
it's funny, I've been coming to this theater my whole life, and I never thought of it as having an address or a number.
you just say,"I'm going to the movies,"and everybody knew what you meant.
Yeah. Like when you say you're going to church.
Yeah, I guess so.
anything else I can help you with?
I'm usually pretty good figuring out passwords.
that's because most people don't want good passwords...they want password.
passwords keep you from going in the front door.
I like to look for an open window, something that allows you to get into the system and unlock things from the other side.
like a burglar. - That's the idea.
that's a nice machine.
your folks?
my mom.
hmm. New car, new computer...
she just lent me the car.
okay, she didn't lend you that sweater.
no, it's a rental.
what? Do you just want me to admit that my mom bought me new clothes?
that not just clothing.
that is $400 worth of sweater you have there.
so I should probably wash it on "gentle" then, right?
No! You should dry clean it!
if you wash this, you will end up with a sweater for a shih tzu.
I have never been a dry cleaning kind of guy.
that was then, and this is now.
Yeah, I know who you're talking about.
I remember those two girls.
that is a couple you don't forget.
how's your friend doing?
it's hard.
and the roughest part was that we all had to talk to the police.
Yeah. I know. Listen, they talked to me.
why would they talk to you?
well, like I said, I remembered her, so that's how I recognized her.
recognized her where?
well, it was late, I was up on the marquee changing the bill, and I saw her get in the cop car with the guy who killed her.
Maya got into a police car with Garrett Reynolds?
Yeah, right up the block. The night he killed her.
she probably thought she was safe. I mean, how could she know that the cop was crazy?
just can't trust anybody.
Yeah, that's for sure.
these are so deadly.
put the pretzel down and cross your fingers.
we're in.
you're kidding.
but at my back I always hear time's winged chariot hurrying near.
Andy Marvel...what a Marvel...
talking to his coy mistress about how they shouldn't waste any time.
like you're doing listening to me.
Oh, my God. I cannot believe that you got us in!
this is where I'm going to put things to keep from losing them.
I'm always losing things.
so this really is Maya's site.
Yeah. It is.
if you're looking at me, beware...this site is cursed.
it is completely real.
did you find anything? - Yeah, that guy Bart Comstock, he saw Maya get into a police car with Garrett the night he killed her.
h-he told you that?
that's why your mom wants to squash him.
I'm gonna try Emily again. - Okay, just...Please let me know when you get a hold of her.
okay. - Bye.
look, it's not too late to ditch this and find a miniature golf course.
Lyle and Frances Springer.
Yeah. My grandparents.
as in Springer preservation fund?
Springer endowment for the arts?
guilty.
Ezra. All of this stuff belongs to your family?
Yeah.
your family doesn't have money, your family has money.
look...I should have figured out a way to tell you about this, but it's kind of hard to work into a conversation.
you were cutting off a lot more than a name when you went from Fitzgerald to Fitz.
all this stuff, it used to be in my grandparents' house, and the only people that ever saw it were my family and people they paid to clean up after them.
and they were fine with that. But I'm not.
I just always thought that you never talked about your family because you didn't want them knowing about me.
I wasn't keep you away from my family. I was keeping my family away from you.
are you angry?
no...
no, I don't think so.
but I think that you owe me something for all those ramen noodles.
I think we can negotiate that. - Okay.
it's okay.
sorry. I didn't think there was anyone here.
I wanted to see what it was like at night.
yesterday was your first time back here since she died...
wasn't it?
Yeah.
I upset you... Making you come out here.
no. It's not that.
you sure? - Yeah. I'm...I'm glad you made me come back.
"made me come back." That doesn't sound so good.
I wanted to. You just helped me make up my mind. - All right.
that was yesterday. How about tonight?
do you think it's possible to do something without knowing you're doing it?
I mean, without knowing why you're doing it?
no.
I think we're always who we are.
okay, but suppose you were drunk.
people drink to cover up what they want.
it's like when you do things in a dream and it frightens you because you didn't think that's who you are.
but it's you.
even in a dream, it's still you.
you cold? - Yeah, a little.
Thanks.
you looked lonely over here.
Oh, I'm fine.
these a amazing.
Ezra said that they belonged to your mom and dad.
that's right.
he hasn't told you very much about himself, has he?
well, we're still learning. - Yes. Well, you certainly know about the dedicated teacher, the struggling writer.
you fit right into that world... you get to be the Muse.
Oh, no, I wouldn't pretend to be that.
don't diminish yourself. You have a very important role in this.
I just... I don't think of myself as playing any role with Ezra.
no, I don't suppose you do.
what do your parents think about Ezra?
well, my mom likes him a lot more than my dad.
fathers and daughters... that can be tricky.
Yeah. - New man coming along to take away daddy's little girl.
your parents are divorced, aren't they? - Yeah. Yeah, they are.
recently?
guess you could say that.
as recently as when you started seeing Ezra?
seeing him... Romantically, I mean.
you ask questions like you already know the answers.
it's really very easy to find out what you need to know about people.
Oh. All... all due respect, but my family's not really any of your business.
Oh, but it's such an interesting family.
your brother's arrest record, your romance with a former teacher, the way your mother moved out over your father's infidelity.
excuse me.
you act as if I've hurt your feelings.
it was unintentional.
I just want to make sure that I'm being clear.
I may not agree with the way Ezra lives his life, but I'm not gonna stand by and let you ruin him.
I love him.
Oh, yes.
it's all romance and sacrifice in your little Paris garret.
except you determine what gets sacrificed, not him.
you're the one that made it impossible for him to stay at your little high school.
you're the one who got him tossed out of Hollis.
I want to make sure you understand your own motives.
I-I don't have any motives.
everyone has motives.
maybe in your world.
it's not too late for us to have a practical discussion.
there can be real-world compensations in your ending this.
Compensations?
I've got your attention at last.
I thought I might.
what did you say to her? - What did I say to whom?
I can't find Aria.
Ohoh. Is she gone?
she was talking to you the last time I saw her.
maybe it's past your bedtime?
it's astounding that you can do things like this and still not understand why I want nothing to do with this family.
I really don't know what you think I've done.
I had a lovely chat with the girl.
I don't know, maybe she just felt out of place.
you can endow all the museums you want, but you're not fooling anybody.
there's not a generous bone in your body.
I believe it would be very therapeutic for Mona to stay at Radley.
she needs the continuity of clinical environment so important to fully integrate the socially challenged teen back into the peer community.
look, Mona did some terrible things.
she did some of them to me, and I'm her best friend.
I-I don't know how she could, but I think I understand how angry she was.
Mona and I are very, very close, I mean, we're like the same person.
we started out at the same place.
and we were so close to becoming those girls who would sit at a table and guard purses while the hot girls were on the floor dancing.
but Mona made sure we didn't disappear...
and I owe her for that.
look, I see her in that robe and those slippers, and I realize that could be me in there.
and if it was me, Mona would be sitting here asking all of you to not send me away.
so please don't.
don't send her to Saratoga.
she doesn't know anyone in Saratoga.
there will be no one there to hold her hand.
so please.
I'm sorry.
it wasn't your fault.
I shouldn't have let it happen.
it was wrong.
if I ever find out who put that stuff in your flask, I swear I'll kill them.
don't say that. - I mean it.
I don't want you to say it, I don't want you to mean it.
I want you to listen.
I haven't been with anyone since Maya.
I haven't even thought about it.
or at least I didn't think I was thinking about it.
I was drunk that night, and I got lost.
only I didn't really get lost.
I was looking for something.
I was looking for somebody...
and I came here.
don't look away.
I heard you come in.
Yeah, I got home a little while ago.
are you okay?
did I ruin Ezra' s life?
what are you talking about?
I know that you think he's wrecking mine, but am I just really screwing things up for him?
am I responsible?
am I... am I just destroying everything that I touch?
no. You couldn't.
you would never hurt anyone.
and no one could ever be harmed by having you in their life.
I screwed up, didn't I?
they're probably gonna send her to Mars now.
you did the opposite of screwing up.
based on your testimony, the board has decided to delay any decision to transfer Mona.
she gets to stay? - She gets to stay.
Oh, my God!
I thought you'd be pleased.
I am. Thank you. - You're welcome.
you're making me laugh.
I'm trying to eat.
we should not be watching this. - Stop it.
there are hundreds of videos, and you don't know what they are until you open them.
everything's jumbled up.
Yeah, it's more of a junk drawer than a journal.
Yeah, but this is real.
Mona gave us the genuine article.
how? - Why?
to help us.
how much of this did Caleb see?
he didn't want to see any of it once he realized what it was, but he got us in there.
I think Emily's got a very old soul.
I feel it when I kiss her.
I can hear clocks all over the world running backwards.
I'm so out of my comfort zone.
Hanna, don't... - just one more.
I'm such a coward. I know that.
I have to face my fears.
I can't hide forever.
I can't keep being afraid. - Call her. - Her phone is off.
well, call her again. Now.
we can't watch this without her.
at least it's on this time.
just looking at you in that hoodie makes me shiver.
I guess summer's really over.
I may not agree with the way Ezra lives his life, but I'm not gonna stand by and let you ruin him.
I also made my dad a collage, and there was a picture of her on a boat.
that's the one. Ce told you she didn't know him? - Why did she lie?
I haven't told you guys the truth.
what truth? - Toby and I broke up.
are you okay? - I'm about to meet my son.
Mona sent you, didn't she?
Spencer, she recognizes self-destructive aggressive behavior.
and who's looking crazy now, Spencer? - Die!
stay at my place. - No.
Yes. You'll sleep on our couch.
you can make that jump.
No!
the patient in bed three, Jason Dilaurentis, where'd he go?
how you holding up, em?
I don't think I'll be taking an elevator any time soon.
any word from Jason?
no. Nothing.
okay, so now that the whole N.A.T. Club is out of Rosewood, do you think that "A" will retire? Or just have more time for us.
way to think positive, Spence.
I just doubt suddenly everything's gonna be lilacs and daffodils.
guys, let's focus.
ce lied about knowing Wilden, and then we find a picture of both of them with Ali.
Yeah, a picture that's gone now.
new rule. Next time we see anything that might be important to us down the road, it goes in the phone.
okay, so is it possible that cece is...
what are we calling her, red coat?
I never saw a face.
Yeah, me neither.
what do you think, Spencer?
blonde? Red coat? Captain of the "A" team?
maybe it's Cece.
pay attention. We need this brain trust firing on all cylinders.
what happened tonight with you and Wren?
it's nothing. I...Mona and I had a... Moment, and, uh, he saw, that's all.
a moment that might make her try and cut Emily in half?
no. No, you guys, this wasn't Mona.
we were in a different county.
well, then who do you think it was?
we're closed.
you're here. - I have the keys.
Yeah, and drinking coffee's not a crime.
what are you doing here?
looking for you girls.
wait, you were following us?
Jason Dilaurentis has been saying some nasty things about me.
like what?
don't play dumb, Hanna.
it wouldn't be the first time you made up a story.
well, I don't know what you're talking about.
so why don't you just leave us alone.
it's just a question. No need to get so defensive.
why don't you ask Ce Drake? - Hanna.
we know about the little boat ride you two took with Alison.
it's late.
we were just leaving.
care for a ride?
it's not safe this time of night. - We're good.
Oh, and Hanna...See you around.
is Caleb having fun with his dad?
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
Wow. After all the hurdles you went through to get them together, I thought you'd be more enthusiastic.
they're just stripping fixtures at his aunt's house...Copper pipes are not that exciting.
am I missing something? - No.
look, mom, you're gonna be late for work.
just get in the car.
what is going on? What?
Hanna, what's going on?
nothing.
that wasn't nothing.
I-I just know the girl who got in his car.
that doesn't explain the look he just gave you.
I-I don't know, mom, all right?
Wilden's a freak. He hates us.
Hanna, did he talk to you again without me being there?
because Veronica Hasting said he wasn't allowed - No, it's fine.
okay. I'll talk to him myself then. - No!
you're not giving me a choice.
well, you can't.
we're just trying to figure out why he's always after us.
okay.
so we were thinking that maybe Wilden and Ali had a relationship.
what kind of relationship?
Oh, my God, Hanna.
why did you even go there?
mom, I told you it was a dumb theory.
no wonder he's upset.
you can't go around saying those things about people, no matter how much you don't like them.
well, don't worry about it.
it all started when that girl got in his car, and I already told Wilden.
so it's over.
how do you even know this person?
she was friends with Ali.
she's a one-woman rumor factory.
all right, well, I don't want you associating with her anymore, okay?
okay. Never again. Gladly.
I have to go meet Emily.
Oh, my God. You're still in bed?
mom and dad called.
I didn't tell them you've been skipping school.
any idea how much longer I'll be covering for you?
if they call again, I'm telling them the truth.
you told your mom?
don't worry about it. We're fine. I covered for us.
what were you thinking? You can't tell her something like that.
I was distracted by Cece and Wilden, okay?
it doesn't make sense. I thought she was protecting him.
well, what if we were wrong, and I just set Ali' s killer on her tail?
why would she lie about knowing him?
we have to find out the truth... confront her.
where? In Wilden's trunk?
he wouldn't grab her in broad daylight if he was gonna hurt her.
probably.
have you heard from Jason?
he texted. He's laying low at a friend's place in Virginia for a while.
I kinda wish he took me with him.
did you tell Paige that she almost got two Emilys for the price of one?
are you kidding?
she's worried enough about me as it is.
do you think Paige and Caleb have told us everything?
I mean, with them digging into Mona, do you think they found out something that we could use?
"a" almost killed me. I am not exposing Paige to that.
no, of course not.
but would it hurt to find out if she picked up anything useful?
Yeah, I-I guess we could go and talk to her after school.
how is Caleb, anyway?
everything go okay with the reunion?
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.
what part isn't?
I don't know. This weird thing happened.
I put a five dollar bill in the church collection box, and it had some dice drawn on it.
and later that day, Caleb' s dad had it.
you gave money to a church?
Emily, I'm serious.
do you know how much money has writing on it?
george Washington has dreadlocks on like half my tips.
Yeah, I know, but what if it was the same one.
the guy's an ex-con.
Hanna, do you really think he would steal from the place that just hired him?
we need to find out the truth.
Hey, Wes.
look, I think that we should talk
Hey.
when did you get back?
about 3: 00 this morning.
I crashed as soon as I got in.
I just woke up.
I haven't been sleeping much the past few weeks.
Yeah, me neither.
I guess I'm just a little confused on why you never called me on one of those sleepless nights.
Aria, my life turned upside down.
I need some time to think about things.
things like us?
for one.
I mean, not about my feelings for you, obviously.
obviously.
what is that supposed to mean?
it's given me nothing to do but fear the worst.
that you'd moved on. - No.
Aria, no. If-if anything, I was trying to be fair to you and not drag you into the middle of this.
I already am and I feel terrible about that.
because this isn't-- this isn't what you signed up for.
that's not your decision to make, it's mine.
you're right.
you're right. I'm sorry.
I shut you out, and that was wrong.
how was your trip?
surreal definitely comes to mind.
but, uh...Malcolm's amazing.
he's smart, lively, really artistic.
did Maggie ever tell you why she kept it a secret?
she did.
my mother paid her to keep quiet.
that's disgusting.
sorry.
no, no, you're right, and believe me, I gave her an earful over the phone.
I never would have said this prior to meeting you, but I've actually been craving vegan takeout.
I want you in my life, Aria. Every part of it. if you're willing.
I just missed you.
I missed you, too.
what happened with Wes?
when you came in, you were on the phone. Said you needed to talk.
Oh, right, yeah. No, nothing. We, um...
he helped me with a shoot the other night, and we messed up some stuff at Cece's store.
it was nothing.
okay.
I'm gonna be late for school.
okay.
Hey. Sorry.
I just wanted to spend my free period in the quiet.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
Yeah. Bad week.
I understand if you don't want me in your classroom.
no, it's okay. I don't mind.
do you feel like talking?
well, I guess you've heard...about Mona.
Mrs. Horowitz wanted you suspended, but Mona said it was just a misunderstanding.
Spencer, I've known you most of your life.
and you've always been the kind of person who would bounce back from disappointment.
I've never seen you this down.
Yeah, well, people change.
I'm sorry.
no, don't apologize.
break-ups are terrible. I get it.
I should probably get going.
if you wanna spend any more of your free periods here, my door is open.
Thanks, miss Montgomery.
what's up?
just heading home.
rosewood costume shop?
Yeah, I-I thought I'd check in with Shana about those queen of hearts costumes on the way.
you said you were done with this.
I know. I am.
liar.
I'm following up.
she said the inventory could take a few weeks.
great. We'll come with Emily, no.
the whole point of this is that I'm protecting you, not the other way around.
no. Doing things alone is what gets us in trouble. Let's go.
are you this hard on Caleb?
Seriously? You're looking for sympathy from the girl who's boyfriend took a bullet in the gut?
is everything okay?
I know that you're in there.
I'm fine.
come on, open up the door.
Ezra's back.
I know that you don't want a friend right now, but that doesn't mean that your friends don't need you.
I still don't understand why you care about this costume.
some girl wore it on the train.
we kinda tangled, and I wanna know who it was.
I'm Shana, by the way.
Paige forgot her manners.
Oh, so it's you in the flesh.
I'm Hanna.
about that costume...
Yeah, I checked. We can't give out that information.
you didn't think to mention this on the phone?
must have slipped my mind.
I didn't realize you'd be bringing your girlfriends.
do you have a restroom?
in the back.
Thanks.
so where are the queen of hearts costumes, anyway? I wanna see what all the fuss is about.
over here.
this is really pretty.
what is this, silk?
try polyester.
I'm really into fashion.
okay, I'd love to chat, but - no!
wait. Um...what's this?
little boy blue.
Yeah, I really, really love this color.
I have to get that.
while you're with a customer?
what is wrong with you?
costumes.
let's go.
Mrs. Fitzgerald. I wanted to thank you.
whatever you said or did, it worked.
Wesley's come home.
he's going to be finishing the year at Dillard.
Oh. Uh, I didn't do anything.
well, in any event, he's back where he belongs.
do you mind if I sit?
I know we didn't get off on the right foot, but your generosity toward my son in the midst of all this does mean something.
Yeah, well, Wes need a place to stay.
I wasn't gonna leave him out on the street.
I meant Ezra.
Wes stayed with you?
I take it you've spoken with Ezra.
I really don't wanna get into the middle of this.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but I was acting in Ezra's best interest.
he was in high school. Just think of yourself, Aria.
how would you feel waking up to that kind of responsibility?
my parents respect me enough to involve me in the decision.
I'm sure they do.
I must admit, I admire your courage staying with Ezra while his life turns upside down.
it will change things, to say the least.
especially for someone like Ezra.
you know he'll make Malcolm the center of his life. And there's Maggie...
well, I won't keep you.
I love you, too.
Caleb's gonna try and I.D. the credit card numbers when he gets back from his aunt's house.
what's wrong?
do you think Toby would ever cheat on Spencer?
wait, what?
it's the only thing I can think of that might explain how upset she's been.
Toby is as loyal as a labrador. I don't think he'd cheat. and neither would paige.
who said anything about Paige?
uh, your face.
I was only worried about it when I saw her with Shana.
there was some serious tension in that room.
look, I know, and it's all my fault.
I should have never put that thought in your head.
are you even sure Shana's gay? She barely looked at me.
that's the criteria? - I'm just saying.
you should have seen those chicks fighting over me at the bar.
anyway, it's like me and Caleb's dad. Just because we've all gotten in the habit of thinking the worst of people doesn't mean it true.
is everything okay?
Ezra's back.
and so is miss Fitz scary.
Oh, I didn't order that.
I did.
boyfriend busy?
I am not gonna discuss my personal life with you.
I'm just trying to make small talk.
yet something tells me I should have my lawyer present.
no, there's no need to make it official.
all right. You wanna talk? Talk.
don't get upset. I'm here as a friend.
but we're not friends.
we have a history.
a history that's ancient, as far as I'm concerned.
listen, I know my record isn't spotless, especially with you, but I take my job very seriously.
I don't want anything to get in the way, especially something outrageous.
outrageous?
teenagers aren't aware of the ramifications of what they say.
if it's outrageous, why do you seem so nervous?
in a town like this, an accusation like that would be the end of me.
is there any truth to it?
of course not. What do you think?
I think you bought a glass of wine for the wrong person.
do you mind if I join you?
no.
I was hoping we could discuss our little road trip.
look, I was wrong.
you wanted to help me and I used you to get at Mona.
I'm sorry.
you shouldn't be. I deserved to be used.
look, I'd be lying if I said I came to you purely in the name of mental health.
Mona had told me about your break-up, and I think...I think that part of me hoped that with Toby out of the picture, that I finally stood a chance.
but it was wrong of me to try and swoop in so quickly.
I let feelings cloud my judgment. And I'm sorry.
Thanks.
your anger toward Mona...Is she the one who came between you and Toby?
Yeah, you could say that.
forgive me. It's none of my business.
I'll leave you.
Wren, wait.
it may have been about Mona, but something good came out of it. it was nice. being with you.
I'm glad I'm not the only one of us who thought so.
do you fancy taking another stab at dinner?
anywhere but Lewisburg?
since when do you care what that hose-beast thinks?
she wasn't wrong, Han.
now with Malcolm and Maggie in the picture, everything's gonna be complicated.
God, how did this even happen?
I mean, I'm actually having a conversation about my boyfriend's son.
and now-now I have to go to his apartment and have dinner with him and act like everything's okay.
okay, Aria, take a deep breath.
Yeah, you have to give it more than ten minutes.
you guys have been through so much.
I know.
okay, but don't you think it's a little weird that he didn't call?
I mean, Wes even thought that was strange.
hold up. His little brother?
Aria, is there something that you're not telling us?
what? No.
okay, yes, fine, maybe I went there for like 2.5 seconds, but no.
no, I just missed Ezra.
it seems like you're talking to everyone in that family except for the one that matters.
it was this beautiful crystal paperweight, with these lavender petals suspended inside.
I never would have pegged you as a thief.
well, I was a terrible one.
I felt so guilty, as soon as I got home from my Na' s house, that I actually I buried it in the backyard.
it's probably still there.
I hate to cut the night short, but I promised a colleague I'd cover his shift for him.
Oh, go. Save some lives.
I had a lovely night.
Yeah, I did, too.
I'm sorry.
I hardly think that's fair.
I'll be on my way.
are you sure you don't want to tell Aria about how hiding my son from me was in everyone's best interest?
best interest. That's what you called it, right, mom?
Malcolm's every need has been seen to.
Oh, god. you're unbelievable.
I can go... - No, no, no. Stay, stay.
we can continue this another time.
like when I'm alone? So you can try to manipulate Aria out of my life again?
Ezra, it's okay.
no, it's not okay.
I'm so sick of this.
I'm not going to apologize for loving you.
and I'm sure as hell not going to let you swoop into my son's life and pretend the past seven years never happened.
well, you've made your feelings perfectly clear.
you're forgetting something.
the key. I know you had one made.
I am so sorry that you had to see that.
any idea why Shana got in trouble for emailing confidential information?
I need to find out who rented those costumes.
so badly you're willing to risk somebody's job?
it's complicated, okay? - Try me. There's more to this than you're letting on.
is it something about mona?
did she kill Garrett?
I don't know!
look, I know you and Caleb are trying to bust her, but this might be bigger than Mona, okay?
she could be working for someone.
someone like who?
that's what we're trying to find out.
at first we thought it was Ce, but now--now we don't know what to think.
why didn't you tell me this?
cause I was being protective.
same as you and Caleb.
now it's your turn.
Shana? - em...
no, we can't be half honest. I saw the way you two looked at each other.
we dated...this summer, while you were working in Haiti.
three weeks.
if it was over, why would you lie about it?
because I didn't wanna hurt you.
Emily, believe me. It's over.
she was a substitute, at a time when I never thought I'd get the real thing.
I love you.
Hey, Hanna. It's me.
I just saw Wilden.
we need to talk about what you told me earlier, okay?
call me as soon as you get this.
love you. Bye.
What'd it take to get you out of bed?
I... Just need some fresh air.
I know it's none of my business, but no company is better than bad company.
what's that supposed to mean?
I bought Wren that Cologne.
don't you wanna give that to goodwill or something?
knowing my mother, there's probably is a tracking device on that.
does malcolm know that you're his dad?
not yet.
it's a big step, but we're trying to ease him into the idea.
well, whatever you decide, I'm here for you.
thank you.
so if my memory serves me correct, I'm pretty sure that I won the last movie night coin toss, which means that we are watching anything but Chinatown.
one of these nights you are going to stay awake through the entire movie.
one of these nights is not tonight.
I'm gonna make popcorn.
Hey, what's up?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down, slow down.
no.
no, it's okay. I got time. Um...
it's Maggie. - Is everything okay?
uh, I don't know, uh, but we will figure something out.
what's wrong?
my mom owns Maggie's condo, and she's selling it. - What?
no, no, no, no. Look, that's not gonna happen.
look, you got rights and nothing nothing's gonna happen overnight.
is there a problem?
have you been drinking?
what are you doing?
just answer the question.
you know very well I haven't.
I know you had a drink at the table.
please step out of the car.
where are you going with this?
are you refusing an order from an officer of the law?
step out of the car please.
we need to talk about Hanna.
can you keep Hanna quiet or not?
if you wanna continue this discussion, call my lawyer.
I'm not the only one with secrets.
you talk, I talk, and you could lose a lot more than your boyfriend.
don't threaten me.
hey... - let go of me!
this is nothing compared to what I'll do if Hanna talks.
I wonder how your lieutenant will respond when he hears you're threatening a child.
he's not going to.
think this through, Ashley.
how do you live with yourself?
Hey, we're not done here!
get out of my way!
I can't let you go!
get out of my way!
either you shut Hanna up, or I will!
where are you going?
anywhere. Fast.
is this about Wilden?
you think?
Emily, I thought you could keep a secret. Is there anyone in this town that you didn't tell?
I saw a picture of you, Wilden, and Ali on a sailboat.
Yeah, she thought he was cute, so she asked him if he'd take us for a ride.
then why lie about it? - I don't have time to talk about this!
you're not the only one that's scared, okay?
please. If there's something I need to know...I thought Wilden got Ali pregnant and killed her to keep it a secret.
so is it true?
I don't know what's true.
Wilden's sure going out of his way to deny it, and if there's one thing Ali could do, it's tell a good lie.
if you thought he killed her, why not turn him in?
Oh, to who? One of his pals on the force?
I didn't know who I could trust.
Jason said he saw you at his house the night Ali disappeared.
he told you that?
God, this is so messed up.
why were you there?
ali called.
she was freaking out about some videos.
everyone wanted them.
Spencer's big sister more than anyone.
when I showed up, she begged me to talk to Ali.
so I did. Then Ali left to go get them.
next day... She was missing.
who took that picture?
you three on the sailboat. Who took it?
help! Melissa!
somebody, please!
Melissa! Can you hear me?!
Melissa, please!
please!
somebody, please!
what happened?
what happened?
God, mom! You almost gave me a heart attack!
mom, what's wrong?
I think I might have killed detective Wilden.
I'm gonna stay with you tonight.
thank god I got your text.
this was revenge.
for what happened with Mona?
for hooking up with Wren.
you...? - it's a long story.
why would Mona care about you and Wren?
can you call Hanna and Emily?
I need them to come over.
sure. Why?
I know who's helping Mona.
there.
I don't want you seeing this.
look, I'm not letting you do this alone.
Mom...Where's Wilden?
I don't know.
you are the last man whom I could ever marry!
do you think any consideration would tempt me?
your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain for the feelings of others!
my opinion of you was decided when I heard Mr Wickham's story of your dealings with him.
well at least in that I may defend myself.
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?
to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose conditions in life is so below my own?
you are mistaken, Mr Darcy.
your declaration merely spared me the concern
I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.
who's there, Fitzwilliam?
Darcy! We'd quite despaired of you!
is that my nephew?
where have you been? Let him come in and explain himself!
no. You will forgive me.
you'll forgive me.
Darcy, you are unwell?
I'm very well, thank you, but I have a pressing matter of business.
you'll forgive me.
make my apologies to Lady Catherine, Fitzwilliam.
to Miss Elizabeth Bennet.
be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, that it contains any repetition of those sentiments or offers which were this evening so disgusting to you.
in particular those relating to Mr Wickham, which if true, would indeed be grievous, but are wholly without foundation, and which I can only refute by laying before you his connection with my family.
mr Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had the management of our estates.
my own father was fond of him and held him in high esteem.
we played together as boys.
after his father's early death, my father supported him at school and at Cambridge, and hoped he would make the church his profession.
but by then George Wickham's habits were as dissolute as his manners were engaging.
my own excellent father died five years ago.
his attachment to Mr Wickham was to the last so steady, that he desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it was vacant.
mr Wickham declined any interest in the church as a career, but requested, and was granted, the sum of 3, 000 pounds instead of the living.
he expressed an intention of studying the law.
I wished, rather than believed him to be sincere.
thank you.
I'm most exceedingly obliged.
all connection between us seemed now dissolved.
Georgiana.
being now free from all restraint, his life was one of idleness and dissipation.
how he lived, I know not.
but last summer our paths crossed again, under the most painful circumstances, which I myself would wish to forget.
my sister, Georgiana, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of Colonel Fitzwilliam and myself.
about a year ago, she was taken from school to Ramsgate, and placed in the care of a Mrs Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived.
and thither also went Mr Wickham, undoubtedly by design.
she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.
she was then but fifteen years old.
a day or two before the intended elopement, I joined them unexpectedly.
unable to support the idea of grieving a brother whom she looked up to almost as a father, she acknowledged the whole plan to me at once.
you may imagine what I felt and how I acted.
mr Wickham left the place immediately.
come.
mr Wickham relinquished his object, which was of course, my sister's fortune of 30, 000.
a secondary motive must have been to revenge himself on me.
had he succeeded, his revenge would have been complete indeed.
this, madam, is a faithful narrative of all my dealings with Mr Wickham.
you do look pale, Lizzy.
why don't you have some breakfast?
I'm sure it will do you good.
I am well, Charlotte.
I've stayed indoors too long. Fresh air and exercise is all I need.
the woods around Rosings are so beautiful at this time of year.
miss Bennet!
mr Darcy.
I've been walking the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
will you do me the honour of reading this letter?
this, madam, is a faithful narrative of my dealings with Mr Wickham, and for its truth I can appeal to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who knows every particular of these transactions.
I know not under what form of falsehood Mr Wickham imposed himself on you, but I hope you'll acquit me of cruelty towards him.
I found that I'd better not meet Mr Darcy.
scenes might arise, unpleasant to more than myself.
the other charge levelled at me, is that regardless of the sentiments of either party,
I detached Mr Bingley from your sister.
I have no wish to deny this, nor can I blame myself for any of my actions in this matter.
I had not long been in Hertfordshire before I saw that Bingley admired your sister, but it was not until the dance at Netherfield that I suspected a serious attachment.
his partiality was clear, but though she received his attentions with pleasure,
I did not detect any symptoms of peculiar regard.
the serenity of her countenance convinced me that her heart was not likely to be easily touched.
insufferable presumption!
I did not wish to believe her to be indifferent.
I believed it on impartial conviction.
very impartial!
you've missed the two gentlemen! They came to take their leave!
mr Darcy came here?
he went away directly, but the Colonel waited for you over half an hour!
now they are gone abroad!
I dare say we shall be able to bear the deprivation.
as to my objections to the marriage, the situation of your family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison with the total want of propriety so frequently betrayed by your mother, your younger sisters, and even occasionally your father.
that will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.
now there will be a great marriage!
my friend left Netherfield for London on the following day.
there I pointed out to him the certain evils of his choice of your sister as a prospective bride.
it was not difficult to convince him of your sister's indifference to him.
I cannot blame myself for having done thus much.
for destroying all her hope of happiness?
Yes, I'm sure you do not blame yourself. Hateful man!
there is but one part of my conduct in the affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction.
astonish me!
that I concealed from him your sister's being in town.
perhaps this concealment was beneath me.
it was done, however, for the best.
on this subject I have nothing more to say, and no other apology to offer.
insufferable!
Lizzy! - Charlotte, we will be late!
Lizzy!
I have endeavoured to count the times
lady Catherine has invited us since your arrival.
I believe it may be as many as ten invitations!
eleven, counting this one! - Eleven!
there! You have indeed been favoured with peculiar condescension.
do you not agree, Miss Elizabeth?
Oh... yes!
how could anybody think otherwise?
and this is your last invitation, on this visit, at least.
it is truly a very cruel deprivation.
I hardly know how I'll bear the loss of her ladyship's company!
you feel it keenly!
Yes, of course you do, my poor young cousin.
they were such fine young men, and so particularly attached to me!
they were excessively sorry to go, but so they always are!
the dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably, but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely.
his attachment to Rosings certainly increases.
you are very dull this evening, Miss Elizabeth Bennet.
you have scarce spoke two words together. Are you so out of spirits?
no indeed, madam.
of course you are, to be going away yourself.
who indeed would not be sad to be deprived of Rosings, and indeed of the gracious...
you will write to your mother and say you wish to stay longer.
surely she could spare you for another fortnight.
but my father cannot.
he wrote to hurry my return.
your ladyship is very kind, but I believe we must leave as planned on Friday.
your father may spare you if your mother can.
daughters are never of much consequence to a father.
and if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take you as far as London myself, in the Barouche box!
for I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.
it is highly improper!
I am excessively attentive to all those things.
my uncle is to send a servant for us when we change to the post.
your uncle! He keeps a manservant, does he?
I'm very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things.
where will you change horses?
at Brom... - Bromley, of course.
mention my name at the Bell and they will attend you.
your ladyship is very kind.
indeed, we are all infinitely indebted to your ladyship's kindly bestowed solicitude...
Yes, yes, but this is all extremely vexing!
I'm quite put out.
what are you doing?
I thought the trunks went outside before breakfast.
lady Catherine was so severe about the only right way to place gowns, that I couldn't sleep, and I'm determined to start afresh!
Maria, this is your trunk and your gowns.
you may arrange them in any way you wish. Lady Catherine will never know!
my dear sister, you'll have much to tell your father...
bring that one round here.
well, cousin...
you have seen for yourself now the happiness of our situation.
our intimacy at Rosings is a blessing of which few could boast!
indeed they could not. - Indeed.
now you have seen our felicity.
perhaps you may think your friend has made a fortunate alliance.
perhaps more so than...
but on this point it will be as well to be silent.
you are very good.
only let me assure you that I can, from my heart, most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage.
Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking.
we seem to have been designed for each other!
Oh, Lizzy! It seems but a day or two since we first came!
and yet how many things have happened!
a great many, indeed.
we have dined nine times at Rosings!
Oh, how much I shall have to tell!
how much I shall have to conceal.
you must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.
Lizzy!
to see your faces when you looked up!
you didn't expect we'd come to meet you.
no, we did not.
there! Is not this nice?
cold ham, and pork, and salads, and every good thing!
we mean to treat you, but you must lend us money, we spent ours. Look!
it's not pretty, but I thought I'd buy it anyway.
it's vile, isn't it?
very ugly. What possessed you to buy it?
there were two or three much uglier!
I shall pull it to pieces and see if I can make it up any better.
it doesn't signify what anyone wears, for the regiment will be at Brighton the whole summer!
our hearts are broken!
and papa refuses to take us to Brighton.
I'm glad to hear it.
shouldn't you like to go to Brighton?
I should not. - She would.
she would love it, when she hears the news about a certain person we know!
shall we tell her?
Yes, and see if she blushes!
you may go. We'll call if you're needed again.
very good, miss.
Wickham is not to marry Mary King after all!
she's been taken away to Liverpool and Wickham is safe!
perhaps we should say Mary King is safe.
was there a very strong attraction between them, do you think?
not on his side! I shouldn't think he cared three straws about her.
who could about such a nasty freckled little thing?
don't look at me like that, Lizzy.
you think just as ill of her! Pass the celery, Kitty.
glad we came to meet you? It'll be merry on the journey home.
Kitty, you're squashing my bandbox!
you should have put it on the roof!
if you don't lollop about there is room.
I don't lollop, you do!
mr Darcy proposed! I can scarce believe it!
not that anyone admiring you should be astonishing.
but he always seemed so severe, so cold, apparently.
and yet he was in love with you all the time! Poor Mr Darcy.
I cannot feel so much compassion for him.
he has other feelings which will soon drive away any regard he felt for me.
you do not blame me for refusing him?
blame you? Oh, no.
but you do blame me for speaking so warmly of Wickham?
no. How could you have known about his vicious character?
if indeed he was so very bad.
but I cannot believe Mr Darcy would fabricate such dreadful slander, involving his own sister too.
no, it must be true.
perhaps there has been some terrible mistake.
no, Jane. That won't do!
you can't make them both good!
there is just enough merit between them to make one good sort of man.
and for my part I'm inclined to believe it's all Mr Darcy's.
poor Mr Darcy.
poor Mr Wickham! There is such an expression of goodness in his countenance.
Yes. I'm afraid one has all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it!
but Lizzy, I am sure that when you first read that letter, you could not have made so light of it as you do now.
indeed I could not.
I was very uncomfortable. Till that moment I never knew myself.
and I had no Jane to comfort me.
Oh, how I wanted you!
there is one point on which I want your advice.
should our general acquaintance be informed of Wickham's true character?
surely there can be no occasion to expose him so cruelly.
what is your opinion?
that it oughtn't be attempted.
mr Darcy has not authorised me to make it public, especially as regards his sister.
as for the rest, who would believe it?
the general prejudice against Mr Darcy is so violent, and Wickham will soon be gone.
I believe we should say nothing at present.
Yes, I agree.
perhaps he is sorry now for what he has done, and is anxious to re-establish his character.
we must not make him desperate.
Oh, Jane!
I wish I could think so well of people as you do.
won't you speak to papa, Lizzy, about our going to Brighton?
you know he listens to your advice.
you flatter me, Lydia. In any case,
I shouldn't attempt to persuade him.
I think it's a very good thing that the regiment is removed from Meryton, and that we are removed from the regiment.
Oh, Lizzy, how can you say such a thing?
very easily, ma'am.
if one company causes such havoc in our family, what would a whole campful of soldiers do?
a whole campful of soldiers!
I remember when I was a girl.
I cried for two days when Colonel Miller's regiment went away.
I thought I should have broke my heart!
I shall break mine.
and I!
there, there, my dears. But your father is determined to be cruel.
I confess I am.
I'm sorry to be breaking hearts, but I have no intention of yielding.
I shall not break my heart, papa.
the pleasures of Brighton would have no charms for me.
I should infinitely prefer a book.
Mrs Forster says she plans to go sea-bathing.
I am sure I should love to go sea-bathing!
a little sea-bathing would set me up forever!
and yet, I am unmoved.
well, well.
I'm glad you are come back, Lizzy.
I'm glad you are come back, Jane.
I want to go to Brighton!
you are not happy, Jane.
it pains me to see it.
it is just that I did...
I'm afraid I still do prefer Mr Bingley to any other man I've met, and Lizzy, I did believe he...
well, I was mistaken, that is all.
I am resolved to think of him no more.
there. Enough.
I shall be myself again, as if I had never set eyes on him.
truly, Lizzy, I promise. I shall be well.
I shall be myself again. I shall be perfectly content.
well, Lizzy, what do you think now about this sad business of Jane's?
I cannot find out that she saw anything of Bingley in London.
well.
an undeserving young man! And I don't suppose there's any chance of her getting him now.
if he should come back to Netherfield, though.
I think there's little chance of that, mamma.
Oh, well. Just as he chooses.
no one wants him to come!
I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill!
if I was her, I would not have put up with it.
my comfort is, she will die of a broken heart, and then he'll be sorry for what he's done!
so, the Collinses live quite comfortable, do they?
I only hope it will last.
and I suppose they talk about having this house too when your father is dead?
they look on it as quite their own, I dare say?
they could hardly discuss such a subject in front of me.
I make no doubt they talk about it constantly when they're alone!
if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better!
I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed upon me!
mamma, mamma! Lizzy!
guess what! You never will, so I'll tell you.
Mrs Forster has invited me, as her particular friend, to go with her to Brighton.
Colonel Forster is to take a house for us!
I'm so happy!
what an honour, to be singled out!
is it not unfair, Lizzy?
Mrs Forster should have asked me as well.
I may not be her dearest friend, but have as much right to be asked!
and more too, for I am two years older!
I'll buy her a present, I dare say.
there's no call to be in a miff because Mrs Forster likes me best.
before you crow too loud, remember papa has not given you permission to go.
nor is he like to.
Papa won't stop me. Not when I'm invited by the Colonel to be his wife's particular companion!
I need new clothes, for I've nothing fit to wear, and there will be balls and parties!
of course you shall have new things!
we wouldn't see you disgraced in front of all the officers!
Woo! All the officers!
I understand your concern, my dear, but consider:
Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place, and here is an opportunity for her to do so, with very little expense or inconvenience to her family.
if you were aware of the very great disadvantage to us all, which has already arisen from Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner, you'd judge differently.
already arisen? Has she frightened away some of your lovers?
don't be cast down, Lizzy.
such squeamish youths are not worth your regret.
Oh come, Lizzy.
indeed you are mistaken.
I have no injuries to resent.
I speak of general, not particular evils.
our... position as a family, our very respectability, is called into question by Lydia's wild behaviour.
I must speak plainly. If you do not check her, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment.
she will become the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous!
you know that Kitty follows wherever Lydia leads.
don't you see that they will be censured and despised wherever they are known?
and that they will involve their sisters in their disgrace.
Lizzy, come here.
don't make yourself uneasy, my love.
wherever you and Jane are known, you must be respected and valued.
and you will not appear to any less advantage for having a couple or...
.I may say, three very silly sisters.
we shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton.
Colonel Forster is a sensible man.
and luckily she's too poor to be an object of prey to a fortune hunter.
leave it now, Lizzy. I believe all will turn out well.
we are so desolated, Colonel, that the regiment is to leave Meryton, but words cannot express what we feel about your kindness to our dear Lydia.
well, ma'am, it appears that Mrs Forster cannot do without her.
lord knows what they find to talk about.
but anything to keep the ladies happy. What do you say, Wickham?
I say amen to that, sir.
there's one lady I shall be very loath to part from.
we must try to bear it. You are for Brighton,
I'll be touring the Lakes with my aunt and uncle.
I dare say we'll find ample sources of consolation and delight... in our different ways.
perhaps. How did you find Rosings?
interesting. Colonel Fitzwilliam was there with Mr Darcy.
are you acquainted with the Colonel?
I...
to some respects, yes, in former years.
a very gentlemanly man.
how did you like him?
I liked him very much.
his manners are very different from his cousin's.
Yes.
but I think Mr Darcy improves on closer acquaintance.
indeed?
in what respect?
has he acquired a touch of civility in his address?
for I dare not hope he is improved in essentials.
no. In essentials, I believe he is very much...as he ever was.
Ah.
I don't mean to imply that either his mind or his manners are changed for the better.
rather: my knowing him better improved my opinion of him.
I see.
Wickham. Wickham.
come here. - At your service, ma'am!
Yes, go, go.
I would not wish you back again.
goodbye, papa. Goodbye, mamma.
Lydia, my dear, we shall miss you most cruelly!
I shall write every day of what I'm doing and make you wild with envy.
I can't help it!
I shall not envy her a jot!
I must go. Goodbye, Jane. Goodbye, Lizzy!
if I see any eligible beaux for you, I'll send word express!
Lord, what a laugh if I should fall and break my head!
I wish you would!
Oh, my dear girl. Take every opportunity of enjoying yourself!
Bye! Bye!
never mind, Kitty. I dare say, in a year or two you'll have got over it tolerably well.
if anyone should ask for me, I shall be in my library, and not to be disturbed.
Hello! I can see, I can see Alicia. Look how she has grown!
you must be so tired.
you have all grown! I think you've all grown since we last said goodbye!
and very pretty too! Come into the house, then.
such a sweet, steady girl!
well, Lizzy!
we bear you bad tidings.
not too grievous though, I hope.
the guilt is mine. My business won't allow me time away to visit all the Lake country.
we shall have to content ourselves with Derbyshire.
Oh.
but Derbyshire has many beauties, has it not?
indeed. To me Derbyshire is the best of all counties.
you will judge for yourself whether Chatsworth is not the equal of Blenheim.
and surely these southern counties have nothing to compare to the wild and untamed beauty of the Peaks.
nature and culture in harmony, you see, Lizzy.
wildness and artifice, and all in the one perfect county!
I was born here, so I should never disagree with that!
where?
at Lambton, a town of no consequence, but to those fortunate enough to have lived in it.
I think it the dearest place in the world!
then I shall not be happy till I have seen it.
it has one further claim on your interest:
it is but five miles from Pemberley, and owes much of its prosperity to that great estate.
so near?
not that I or anyone of my acquaintance enjoyed the privilege of intimacy with that family.
we moved in very different circles.
a hit! Acknowledged. Very good, sir!
enough, sir?
enough. Thank you, Baines.
will you come again tomorrow, sir?
no, I have business in the North.
I'll come tomorrow week.
very good, sir. Bid you good day, sir.
thank you, Baines. Good day.
I shall conquer this. I shall!
Elizabeth, be careful!
how could I face your father if you took a fall?
beautiful!
thank you, Hannah.
you're welcome, sir.
I should be quite happy to stay my whole life in Derbyshire!
I'm happy to hear it. What do you say to visiting Pemberley tomorrow?
it's not more than a mile or two out of our way.
do you especially wish to see it, aunt?
I thought you would, having heard so much about it.
the associations are not all unpleasant.
Wickham passed all his youth there, you know.
we have no business there.
I should feel awkward to visit the place without a proper invitation.
no more than Blenheim or Chatsworth. There was no awkwardness there.
I shouldn't care for it myself, Lizzy, if it were merely a fine house, richly furnished.
but the grounds are delightful.
they have some of the finest woods in the country.
how far is Pemberley, my dear?
not more than five miles, sir.
the grounds are very fine, are they not?
as fine as you'll see anywhere, ma'am.
my oldest brother is an under-gardener there.
is the family here for the summer?
no, ma'am.
well?
perhaps we might visit Pemberley after all.
I think we've seen woods and groves enough to satisfy even your enthusiasm for them, Lizzy!
I confess I had no idea Pemberley was such a great estate.
shall we reach the house itself before dark?
be patient. Wait.
there!
stop the coach!
I think one would put up with a good deal to be mistress of Pemberley.
the mistress of Pemberley will have to put up with a good deal, from what I hear.
she's not likely to be anyone we know.
how do you like the house, Lizzy?
very well.
I don't think I've ever seen a place so happily situated.
I like it very well indeed.
drive on!
a pity then, its owner should be such a proud and disagreeable man.
Yes, a great pity.
perhaps the beauty of the house renders its owner a little less repulsive, Lizzy?
Yes, perhaps.
perhaps a very little.
well, shall we apply to the housekeeper to see inside the place?
that's where Mrs Darcy used to write her letters every morning.
it was her favourite room.
this is the music room.
charming! - What a lovely room!
delightful!
and there's a fine prospect from that window down towards the lake.
look at this, my dear.
it's quite magnificent!
of all this I might have been mistress.
this piano has just come down.
it's a present from my master for Miss Georgiana.
your master is from home, we understand.
Yes, but we expect him here tomorrow, sir.
he is coming with a large party of friends and Miss Georgiana.
this portrait was painted earlier this year, for her sixteenth birthday.
she is a very handsome young lady!
Oh, yes! The handsomest young lady that ever was seen.
and so accomplished. She plays and sings all day long!
Lizzy!
look at this picture.
it reminds me very much of someone we know!
this one, ma'am?
that young gentleman was the son of the late Mr Darcy's steward, Mr Wickham.
he is gone into the army now. But he's turned out very wild.
very wild indeed, I'm afraid.
and that's my master. And very like him too.
it's a handsome face, but I've never seen the original.
is it like him, Lizzy?
does this young lady know the master?
Yes, a little.
and he is a handsome gentleman, is he not, ma'am?
Yes, very handsome.
I'm sure I know none so handsome.
nor so kind. - Indeed?
aye, sir. I've never had a cross word from him, and I've known him since he was four years old.
I've observed that they that are good-natured as children, are good-natured when they grow up.
his father was an excellent man.
he was, ma'am. His son will be just like him.
the best landlord, and the best master.
ask any of his tenants or his servants.
some call him proud. I fancy that's only because he don't rattle away, like other young men do.
now if you will follow me, there's a finer, larger portrait of him in the gallery upstairs.
this way, sir, if you please.
this fine account of Darcy is not quite consistent with his behaviour to poor Wickham.
perhaps we might have been deceived there.
that's not likely, is it?
magnificent!
there!
would you not like to ride him, sir?
no, take him back to the stables.
mr Darcy.
miss Bennet. I...
I did not expect to see you, sir.
we understood the family were from home, or we should never have...
I returned a day early.
excuse me, your parents are in good health?
Yes, they are very well. I thank you, sir.
I'm glad to hear it.
how long have you been in this part of the country?
but two days, sir.
where are you staying?
Lambton Inn.
Yes, of course.
well, I'm just arrived myself.
and your parents are in good health? And all your sisters?
Yes, they are all in excellent health, sir.
excuse me.
the man himself, I presume!
as handsome as in his portrait.
though perhaps a little less formally attired.
we must leave here at once!
of course, if you wish.
Oh, I wish we'd never come!
what must he think of me?
what did he say?
nothing of consequence. He enquired after my parents...
miss Bennet.
allow me to apologise for not receiving you properly.
were you leaving?
we were, sir. I think we must.
I hope you are not displeased with Pemberley?
no, not at all.
then you approve of it?
very much. I think there are few who would not.
your good opinion is rarely bestowed, and therefore more worth the earning.
thank you.
would you introduce me to your friends?
certainly.
mr and Mrs Edward Gardiner, Mr Darcy.
Mrs Gardiner is my aunt, Mr Darcy.
my sister Jane stayed at their house in Cheapside when she was in London.
delighted to make your acquaintance, madam, sir.
you're staying at Lambton, I hear.
Yes, sir. I grew up there as a girl.
delightful village. I ran to Lambton as a boy almost every day in the horse-chestnut season.
there was one very fine tree there.
on the green, by the smithy!
mr Gardiner, do you care for fishing?
indeed I do, when I get the chance.
you must fish in my trout stream. There are carp, tench and pike in the lake, for coarse fishing.
I'll gladly provide you with rods and tackle, show you the best spots. Let's walk down now.
follow us to the lake. My man will show you.
there's a place down there where we...
is this the proud Darcy you told us of?
he is all ease and friendliness. No false dignity at all!
I'm as astonished as you are.
I can't imagine what has affected this transformation.
can you not?
do you... - I...
pray continue.
I was going to say again, sir, how very unexpected your arrival was.
if we had known you were to be here, we should not have dreamt of invading your privacy.
the housekeeper assured us you would not be here until tomorrow.
do not make yourself uneasy. I had planned it so myself, but I found I had business with my steward.
I rode on ahead of the rest of the party.
they will join me tomorrow.
and among them are those who claim an acquaintance with you.
it's Mr Bingley and his sisters.
Oh.
there is the other person in the party who more particularly wishes to know you.
will you allow me to...
do I ask too much to introduce my sister to you, during your stay at Lambton?
I should be very happy to make her acquaintance.
thank you.
thank you.
I hope we shall meet again very soon.
good day, Mr Gardiner. Mrs Gardiner.
good day, Miss Bennet.
this is for you.
it's what you need to read before your meeting with Brenda McGowan.
lee's going to help you with college.
Hey, what's this song?
it's not a song that Tippy's singing, it's a phone number.
where is this area code, anyways?
York county.
did Ali know anybody from there?
there was a college there, I just saw it. Cicero. - Yeah, look.
I gave the R. V. to "A" for nothing.
I think "A" gave you something real.
we've got to find Dr. Palmer.
will you tell her to stay away from that girl?
what girl? - That blonde girl.
are you Brendan? - Yeah.
if you want, I could go through some of these schools with you.
I didn't think that you were the type of person who would lead somebody on just to get what you wanted.
what did you say to mom to make her change her mind about Europe?
the only reason you want her to go so bad is so you could start boffing your teacher again.
that was Mrs. Grunwaltz, our former house mother.
legend has it she was fired.
apparently you couldn't get anything past that bitch.
detective Wilden, he's dead.
Hanna's worried that they're going to try to pin it on her mom.
they are both going to need help.
I keep a gun locked in my desk.
it's missing.
it's the gun. At least I think it is.
why do you have that? - They found it in my mom's closet. I have to get rid of it.
hold it! Don't move.
you won't say why you had the gun.
or where you got the gun.
or why it appeared you were burying the gun on a college campus.
you want some?
Hanna, you don't need a lawyer to tell me whether or not you'd like a cup coffee.
no, thank you.
how about I tell you what I know?
you were carrying a concealed firearm without a license.
the gun is a 38 caliber revolver.
yours holds six bullets, but you had only four.
straightaway you gotta wonder where the other bullets went, right?
you could be looking at a third-degree felony charge for carrying a concealed weapon.
that's up to a seven-year sentence.
Hanna, I do not want to see that happen to you.
neither do you. Neither do your parents.
but I need you to think about who you're trying to protect and why.
how do you know I wasn't just protecting myself?
a hunch.
that'll be your mom.
Hanna, we're going.
her bail's been paid and her lawyer's on the way. Come on.
I will walk you out.
they called you?
they're keeping the gun. For testing.
what kind of testing?
dad.
the kind that determines whether your dad's gun was used to kill a police officer.
I'll be in touch.
well, I thought maybe you'd be at school today.
are you okay? What's going on?
there's no school until the D. A. calls.
I could get seven years...
seven years? For what?
carrying a concealed weapon, attempting to destroy evidence.
murder. I don't know, whatever they find.
you're not a murderer.
well, I'm ruining my mom's life, so that's gotta count for something.
Hanna, listen to me.
"a" planted your mom's cell phone in Wilden's casket.
"a" fished that car out of the lake.
and two days ago,"A" called the cops on you.
this is a set up.
God, was that just two days ago?
maybe this is it, Hanna.
I think you have to tell your parents about "A."
no. Em, none of that matters if my mom pulled the trigger.
she's the one who lied about where she was the night.
Wilden died, and she's the one with a gun in her closet.
Hey, Emily.
em? Are you there?
I need to call you right back, okay.
what are you doing here? And why are you wearing that?
I'm on the team. As of today.
you go to Rosewood now? - Yeah.
so, you just switched schools mid-semester? Why?
better swim team, better chance of a scholarship.
Plus, I didn't like private school.
I never really fit in.
I'm sorry about your shoulder.
must suck to be off the team.
I know how much it meant to you.
you don't know anything about me.
Jenna's told me a few things.
looks fun. Too late to sign up?
I need to know exactly what you told the cops.
word for word.
I didn't tell them anything.
I said nothing about your gun, I didn't say a word.
Yeah, well, you're gonna tell me.
where you found it, and why the hell you took it to that college.
what were you thinking?
I was trying to protect mom.
protect mom? Hanna...
if you took that gun from my office... - I did not take the gun.
I found it in mom's luggage from New York.
shut that thing off, and come downstairs.
when you called me back from that sorority party,
I thought you were gonna tell me that you'd found the person Ali was talking to, not that...
Hanna got arrested. - Yeah. Not that.
Where's Emily? It's not like her to be late.
I don't know, maybe she got a hold of Hanna.
Yeah, or she could be avoiding me.
all right, well you need to apologize or get over it or do whatever you have to do, okay?
I don't care who said what to who, but we need all brains on board and we're already down one. You got it?
aye aye, Captain.
Ugh. Taste this. It's disgusting.
no, you just spit in it.
Hey, em.
you talk to Hanna? Is this mine?
Yeah, but don't.
how is she?
freaked out. She's waiting to hear back from the D. A. About the charges.
meanwhile, the cops are running tests on her dad's gun to see if it was used to kill Wilden.
they can actually do that?
Yeah. It's called ballistics.
when you fire a gun, the barrel leaves grooves on the bullet. Like a pattern.
and if the pattern of that barrel matches the bullet that killed Wilden, then bam, that's the murder weapon.
and there's more.
Shana's back. Permanently.
she enrolled at Rosewood high, and took my spot on the swim team.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about the girl who may have tried to set us on fire, run you over, sitting next to us in social studies.
but why? What does Shana have against us?
well, Mona said Shana was in love with Jenna.
and that they were both afraid of Melissa...
who moved to London.
so, Melissa moves out; Shana moves in.
and Jenna gets a new seeing eye dog at Rosewood high.
on top of everything, guess who's in charge of training the new guy and running the open mic night tomorrow?
Hey, let me help.
just sit down, settle in, okay?
I'll deal with it, my brother knows him.
Hi. First day?
that obvious?
you're Connor, right? You play lacrosse with Mike. - Yeah.
well, at least you're better on the field.
I just wish that I could erase everything from that night.
I'm sorry, too. I should have told you the real reason why I was there.
well, how could you? I bulldozed over every opportunity that you had.
I bulldozed over you.
I bulldozed over Hanna when she tried to tell me about the gun.
and now I'm bulldozing over your apology.
I'm really sorry.
so, you excited for your game on Saturday? Guilford, right?
Yeah. Mrs. Welch is making me redo this essay,
I got to get at least a B or I'll be sitting the bench.
maybe you could help.
Mike says you're, like, some writing genius.
maybe you could just look it over? Make sure it's in English?
Yeah, sure. I could do that.
she found the gun in your bag, Ashley. In your closet.
Hanna, how could you say that?
because it's true.
let her talk.
I'm sorry, okay?
I was looking for your shoes and then...
they were ruined. I threw them out.
this isn't about what she was looking for.
it's about what she found.
you took my gun.
Tom, you have no idea what happened.
well, please, tell me!
I didn't kill anyone and I did not bring a gun into this house.
then who did, Ashley?
I don't know. I am telling the truth. I don't know!
if it turns out that my gun was used to kill a police officer...
someone is setting me up! - Who?
who would do that? - I don't know.
I... - do you know crazy this sounds?
guys.
Ugh. Mo' Mona, mo' problems.
can I talk to you?
where the hell have you been?
I'm sorry; that wasn't a question.
I need to talk to you. Alone.
you said we were in this together, and then you just disappeared.
whatever you have to say to Spencer, you can say to all of us.
have it your way.
I've been tracking down my missing R. V.
that's where I've been.
Toby took it. He gave it to "A," but Spencer already knew that.
she's been covering for him.
you're lying.
I'm really not.
then you'd better have proof.
look, I'll take heels over a hoodie any day of the week, but just 'cause I'm not "A" anymore, doesn't mean I can't recon your asses when I need to.
so, yeah, I have proof.
Spencer, say something.
it's true.
Mona may not be "A,"but she's definitely still a "B."
did you see that smirk on her face?
I just can't believe that Spencer would keep that from us.
you know there was a reason Toby did this.
I mean, there has to be.
reason or not, I can't help thinking Hanna wouldn't be in this mess if we still had that R. V.
what if Mona had something that could prove that Hanna's mom was innocent?
proof that somebody else wanted Wilden dead.
a video, a photo, anything.
my parents took my cell phone, so don't call it.
okay.
her parents took her phone.
look, Hanna, we have to tell you something.
well, can it wait? They could pick up any minute.
Yeah, yeah, of course.
you have to tell her to talk to her parents.
"a" is framing my mom, all right.
she didn't kill Wilden, she didn't put the gun in her overnight bag.
"a" did. I walked right into the trap.
all right, what Emily thinks...
I know what Emily thinks, but I can't say anything to them.
because "A" is threatening to take down my mom and my dad if I say one thing about my mom being framed.
one word, one freaking letter, my whole family's locked up.
Tom, don't...
don't call her.
she needs to know this. - She already does.
she doesn't want us to do anything to help.
are we gonna listen?
damn it, Tom, he threatened me. He threatened Hanna.
I couldn't come up with the kind of money he wanted to get him to leave town, so I took the gun for protection.
you have no idea what we've been through.
no, you can't just show up here... - you came to me for money, and you left with my gun.
don't act like I'm not involved.
I was scared, okay?
I took the gun because I didn't know what was gonna happen.
he grabbed the gun out of my hands, and I ran.
I swear to God, I did not shoot him.
Hey. - Hello, Caleb.
are you okay? I've been trying to reach you.
look, I know you're worried about Hanna, but you cannot be here right now.
no, you need to leave. Now.
no, dad, stop... - Hanna, please.
she's in a lot of trouble.
the less people she speaks to the better.
I am not here to question her. I'm here to help.
you can't right now. Caleb, we will call you if anything happens.
just please, go.
I knew that this would happen.
now, instead of finding out from us, they found out from Mona.
if we just tell them the truth, I know that they'll understand.
if we tell them, it's over.
I'll never know what happened to my mom.
Why? Why would you say that?
I went back to Radley.
I talked to Eddie lamb.
I asked him all about what Dr. Palmer said.
about the blonde girl. All of it.
and what did he say? Did he mention Ali? - No.
he knows something, but he's not gonna tell me.
neither will my dad.
you spoke with your father about this?
I tried to.
it didn't go well.
look, I've run out of leads, Spence.
but "A" still knows something.
"a" is the only chance I have of finding out what really happened to my mom.
Spencer, what are you doing?
look, I'm not gonna force you to change your mind, but I have to fix this, with or without you.
who are you calling? - I've got to earn back some trust.
Hi, my name is Spencer...
I can't believe you copied the cliff's notes.
well, it was the only thing that made sense.
and I used proper citation.
Yes, I see that. It's right next to the footnote for Wikipedia.
what are you doing here?
I'm helping him with his English paper. You going out?
Yeah, what's it look like?
okay, well when are you going to be back? - Later.
did you talk to mom today?
Hey, have fun.
all right, so...
page three. Just because Faulkner used run-on sentences, does not mean that you get to.
is he cool with me being here?
Yeah, it's not about you.
I can't believe that they let you in.
my dad practically threw Caleb out the door.
I brought an excuse.
homework.
thank you.
wait, I'm not in physics.
I was counting on your parents not knowing that.
must be weird having your dad here.
I haven't really found a word for it yet. But yeah.
how are you? Really.
I'm in purgatory.
a condition of temporary punishment and suffering, from which I may never leave. I looked it up.
along with everything I could find on prosecuting minors and state minimums for third-degree federal offenses.
that was before they took away my Internet.
if your mom didn't...
do it, then it may not be the gun, Hanna.
okay, we don't know for sure.
"a" can't tamper with ballistics evidence.
we don't know what "A" can and cannot do.
the sooner we accept that the better.
look, I'm not just here for fake homework.
I want the dash cam footage that Mona gave you.
the one from Wilden's car.
no. Hell no.
you don't even know what I want it for.
I don't care. Emily, my mom is in that video hitting Wilden with a car, all right.
I should have just listened to Mona and burned it the second that she gave it to me.
but you didn't.
the first half of the video looks bad for your mom, but the second half proves that Jenna and Shana are connected to Wilden.
they carried him off the road in the middle of the night and no one reported anything.
the cops need to see that.
it could look like they were hurting him, and not helping him.
and at the very least, it adds in two more suspects to the mix.
look, anything I do backfires.
if I say one word about "A," my dad goes down. Do you get that?
that's if you say something, Hanna, not me.
please, Hanna. This could be your only chance.
and the cops never have to know where it came from.
I really appreciate this.
Mrs. Welch is a freak about references.
I'm happy to help.
this was fun.
I told you Faulkner wasn't all that bad.
I meant you. It's nice hanging out with you.
Thanks.
Yeah, next time we ought to do this over burgers instead of books.
Oh, no. You don't need that much help. You'll do fine.
Oh, but have a great game Saturday.
I'm sorry, I'm not interested like that.
you trying to burn the house down?
it's fine. I'm fine.
no, you're not fine.
what did Veronica say?
they don't know anything yet.
what else?
the fact that we haven't heard anything, not about Hanna, not about the gun...
it's not a good sign.
Oh! Damn it!
just leave me alone, all right?
just leave me alone for two seconds.
just, hold onto this.
just tell me it was self-defense.
people could believe that.
I could believe that.
believe what you want, Tom.
I already told you what happened.
Hanna wanted me to give you this.
she also wanted me to cop a feel on her behalf, but...
her parents said they would call me if anything happened, but I haven't heard anything.
well, maybe that's a good thing.
we have the truth on our side this time.
thanks for this. - Yeah.
Hey, Emily.
I've been looking for you. I know who Ali was calling.
at least I think I do.
I was talking to all of these sorority girls, and they didn't know anything about a hidden room, - but a couple years ago, there was this housemother - the Grunwald.
Yeah. Exactly. And she would disappear for hours at a time, and then all of the sudden, poof, she would reappear as if she'd never left the house.
what if Mrs. Grunwald was using that hidden room?
what if that's who Ali was calling?
I don't think the Grunwald wore board shorts.
okay, so we got that part wrong.
but this is our chance to get it right.
Mrs. Grunwald could know who was after Ali. It could be "A."
it could be the same person who's framing Hanna's mom.
look, you wanna help Hanna, right?
so, let's go talk to Mrs. Grunwald today, okay? You and me.
Spencer, stop. Having Mona's R. V. could've helped Hanna.
and I'm not going on another wild goose chase with you just so you can clear your guilty conscience.
look, I want to explain everything, but I just can't. Not yet.
I know you're trying to protect Toby, but I really wish you'd think about the people you were hurting.
Hey.
Hi. What's up?
how could you do that?
do what?
hook up with Connor last night!
what?
where did you hear that?
where do you think? I was just in the locker room.
and you can't...
excuse me. Hi, I need to talk to you.
she can't get enough, can she?
all right, in case you or any of your friends are confused, you tried to kiss me, and I pushed you off, and then you left.
all right? That's what happened.
that's all that happened, okay?
you can quit the innocent virgin act.
what are you talking about?
everyone knows you and Mr. Fitz weren't just scrabble buddies.
excuse me?
how many points for the word "slut"?
ms. Montgomery, you shouldn't be in here.
you still okay on gas?
Yeah.
is she expecting you? Mrs. Grunwald?
no.
I'm sorry, Spencer.
I know.
are you okay?
what happened in there?
before I came in.
Aria, those guys are jerks.
you can't just let some stupid rumor get to you...
it's not "some stupid rumor" if there's some truth to it, Ezra.
look, you cannot be the guy that helps me feel better anymore.
don't you get that?
just stay away from me. Please.
do you see a street sign anywhere?
no. Nothing.
excuse me.
sorry, I think we're lost.
do you know if saw mill road is up ahead?
let's get out of here.
Mona. We need to talk.
we're talking now? - Tell me what "A" has on Toby.
okay? I need to know.
don't we all? - Mona, please. I want in.
on what? - On whatever it is you have going on.
you tracked down your R. V.
you found out about Spencer and Toby.
you've got the fast track on "A," while the rest have nothing.
I'm not the one pulling the strings anymore, Emily.
all I have is an empty R. V.
everything bad that I've done, everything you've done,"A" has proof.
one wrong move and we all go up in flames.
maybe this time, we don't get out of them.
are you sure this is the right place?
Yeah, this is the address.
excuse me?
Hi. We were hoping to speak with Mrs. Grunwald. Is she home?
it's important.
there's no one here but me.
and I only deal with the master of the house.
well, we must have the wrong address.
I'm starving. Let's grab something to eat.
I'm not hungry. I mean, I have a large pit in my stomach, but I'm not hungry.
you definitely need to eat something.
I'm not driving back to Rosewood with low-blood-sugar Spencer.
that's worse than no-caffeine Spencer.
wow, your girlfriend sounds awesome.
Mrs. Grunwald?
it was 3 summers ago.
it was all over the news.
well, I must have missed it.
well, my friends and I aren't really sure that she's gone.
maybe you still know this person.
I didn't know her alive. I certainly don't know her dead.
maybe you only spoke with her on the phone.
she might've gone by the name Vivian.
she thought that somebody was after her, so maybe she was asking for help, or a place to stay.
I'm sorry, it doesn't ring a bell.
the girls said you disappeared everyday for hours at a time and then you would suddenly reappear as if you'd never left.
so, I know that it was you on that phone.
and then one day you were gone. Isn't that right?
were you running some kind of business?
I'm very sorry about your friend, really.
but I can't help you.
I'm not who you think I am.
excuse me.
go away.
Hey, can I talk to you?
Mike, just leave me alone, please.
look, I'm sorry your whole team thinks I'm a slut.
I'm sorry about mom going away. I'm sorry, okay?
I messed up.
I should've known that Connor was making that stuff up.
look, I'm your brother.
I'm supposed to watch out for you.
stand up for you.
I'm gonna make it up to you, okay?
okay?
where you been?
I didn't do anything. I just needed some air.
you know, I took the old footpath behind the Mendez house.
the one that leads to the pond.
you used to take me skating there when I was little.
now it's all dried up.
that happens this time of year.
but it'll fill up again.
this is all my fault.
it's my fault that mom ever got involved with Wilden.
it's my fault the police found the gun.
God, how could I be so stupid?
I mean, I try to fix things. And it just...
it just gets worse.
Hanna, I wish you'd come to me.
Yeah.
well, the way Caleb described it...
honestly, dad...
I didn't think you wanted me to.
she would rather fry the hair off her head than talk to me.
she could be telling the truth.
she's not.
I know you don't want to go back home empty-handed, but we have to face facts.
you're following a lead that came from a bird.
maybe it was never a real clue.
maybe Alison's grandmother called that number instead of Ali.
you have to learn when to let go, Spencer.
me? I need to learn when to let things go?
I might be trusting a bird, but you're trusting "A"
I'm gonna go see what they have across the street.
you sure you don't want anything?
Spencer, what is it?
Shana's here. I just saw her.
that's Jenna's car.
come on.
get in, get in! - Go, go, go, go, go, go.
what was that?
what the hell was that?
Oh, my God.
chocolate or raspberry?
okay, you can stop with the sympathy food.
chocolate. Obviously.
look, if I could've had anyone else working tonight, you know I would have.
no, it's fine. Really.
and plus I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
says my suddenly wise younger brother.
well, if it makes you feel better, I did put him on garbage duty.
huh, it does. Thank you.
any chance you're still talking to me?
Yeah.
how was the Grunwald?
she said that she didn't know Ali.
but I think that Shana got to her first.
you think or you know?
I saw her there. Shana. In creepy-ville.
what is lieutenant Tanner doing here?
maybe she's into slam poetry?
lieutenant Tanner, hi.
did my mom tell you about the event tonight?
I saw a flyer up at the station.
but I'm not here for the music.
can you get someone to cover you for you for a moment? - me
um, yeah. Sure.
good. I need you at the station.
alone. It won't take long.
is this supposed to be you?
I don't know.
someone saw you here this morning putting up a flyer.
an hour later I find this on my desk.
I didn't write this.
there's a mother's day card on your mom's desk.
handwriting's a match.
did she see this?
not yet.
let's say you didn't put this on my desk.
who did?
it's probably someone's idea of a prank.
some prank. Framing someone for murder.
okay. I'm coming.
we're gonna have to continue this later.
first Hanna, now Emily.
don't say it like that. - Like what?
like one of us is next.
tell me about Shana.
there's not that much to tell, really.
I saw her in that town, and then she jumped in Jenna's car and she drove away.
we tried to follow, but we lost her.
no, you didn't.
Hey, stop! Stop, that's my car.
what are you doing?
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney, if you... - she didn't do it!
one will be appointed to you... - you have to believe me.
you can't do this. She didn't do it.
mom! Come on, tell her that you didn't do it.
that gun was used to kill Detective Wilden, and your mother's fingerprints are on the bullets.
I need you to look after Hanna.
whatever she needs. Whatever happens to me, please...
mom...
I love you.
if you please, ma'am!
there are two gentlemen and a lady waiting upon you in the parlour.
one of them is Mr Darcy.
thank you. Tell them I shall come directly.
mr Darcy.
I hope that you have not been waiting long.
not at all.
may I introduce my sister Georgiana?
georgiana, this is Miss Elizabeth Bennet.
how do you do?
I'm very pleased to meet you, Miss Darcy.
I've heard so much about you.
and I about you.
mr Bingley is here with us, and very desirous to see you as well.
he insisted on accompanying us.
may I summon him?
of course! I should like to see him very much.
I understand that you are fond of music, and play very well.
Oh, no. Not play very well.
I mean, but I am very fond of music.
I should dearly love to hear you play and sing.
my brother has told me he has rarely heard anything that gave him more pleasure.
well, you shall. But I warn you, your brother has grossly exaggerated my talents.
no doubt for some mischievous reason.
Oh, no. That could not be so.
my brother never exaggerates.
he always tells the absolute truth.
except that sometimes I think he is a little too kind to me.
an ideal elder brother, then.
Yes! I couldn't imagine a better or a kinder one.
you make me feel quite envious.
I have no brothers at all. Only four sisters.
I should have liked to have a sister.
miss Bennet!
I was so delighted when Darcy told me you were not five miles from Pemberley!
how do you do?
I see you are well.
very well, thank you.
good, good, excellent! And your family?
very well, sir.
yes?
pray, tell me. Are all your sisters still at Longbourn?
all except one. My youngest sister is at Brighton.
Ah.
it seems too long...
.it is too long, since I had the pleasure of speaking to you.
it must be several months.
it is above eight months at least.
we have not met since the 26th of November, when we were dancing together at Netherfield.
I think you must be right.
I don't think I can remember a happier time than those short months I spent in Hertfordshire.
miss Bennet, my sister has a request to make of you.
miss Bennet, my brother and I would be honoured if you and your aunt and uncle would be our guests at Pemberley for dinner.
would tomorrow evening be convenient?
thank you, we shall be delighted.
I can answer for Mr and Mrs Gardiner.
we have no fixed engagements.
and shall we hear you play?
if you insist upon it, yes, you shall.
absolutely marvellous!
will you not play again?
you played that song so beautifully.
not very beautifully, not faithfully at all.
you must have seen how I fudged and slurred my way through the difficult passages.
it's a beautiful instrument, though.
my brother gave it to me.
he is so good. I don't deserve it.
I am sure you do.
your brother thinks you do, and as you know, he is never wrong.
now, it's your turn. Oh, I absolutely insist!
in front of all these people?
I will play, but please don't make me sing.
if you like.
pray, Miss Eliza, are the Militia still quartered at Meryton?
no, they are encamped at Brighton for the summer.
that must be a great loss for your family.
we're enduring it as best we can, Miss Bingley.
I should have thought one gentleman's absence might have caused particular pangs.
I can't imagine who you mean.
I understood that certain ladies found the society of Mr Wickham curiously agreeable.
I'm so sorry. I'm neglecting you.
how can you play with no one to turn the pages.
there, allow me.
how very ill Eliza Bennet looked this evening!
I've never seen anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.
quite so, my dear.
she is grown so brown and coarse.
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should hardly know her.
what do you say, Mr Darcy?
I noticed no great difference.
she is, I suppose, a little tanned.
hardly surprising when one travels in the summer.
for my part, I must confess, I never saw any beauty in her face.
her features are not at all handsome.
her complexion has no brilliancy.
her teeth are tolerable, I suppose, but nothing out of the common way.
and as for her eyes, which I have sometimes heard called fine,
I could never perceive anything extraordinary in them.
and in her air there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which I find intolerable.
I think...
when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find her a reputed beauty!
I particularly recall you, Mr Darcy, one night after they had been dining at Netherfield, saying: "She a beauty?"
I should as soon call her mother a "wit"!
but afterwards she seemed to improve on you.
I even believe you thought her rather pretty at one time.
Yes, I did. That was only when I first knew her.
for many months now I have considered her one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.
no, no, the green one.
Yes, that will do.
good. No, never mind that.
if you please, ma'am. The post's just come.
thank you, Hannah.
a good girl, that. Very obliging.
two letters from Jane. At last!
I had been wondering why we hadn't...
this one was misdirected at first.
no wonder, for she wrote the direction very ill, indeed!
would you be angry if I beg you to postpone our outing?
not at all! Of course you want to read your letters.
we will walk to the church and call back in an hour.
thank you, you're very kind!
my dearest Lizzy, I hope your journey has been as delightful as you anticipated.
we all miss you.
our father most of all, I believe.
I have hardly had time to write.
my nephews and nieces have taken almost every moment!
but they are such dear children.
our mother indeed finds their exuberance a little trying for her nerves.
Mamma...
she spends much of the day above stairs in her room, or with Mrs Philips.
dearest Lizzy, since writing the above, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature.
but I'm afraid of alarming you.
be assured we are all well.
what I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
Lydia!
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed.
mr Bennet, what is it?
are we to be murdered in our beds?
the letter was from Colonel Forster, to inform us that Lydia was gone off to
scotland with one of his officers.
to own the truth... with Wickham.
Oh, Lydia!
Oh, Mr Bennet, we are all ruined!
you will imagine our surprise and shock.
to Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected.
I am very, very sorry.
so imprudent a match on both sides!
but I'm willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
I wish I could believe it.
his choice is disinterested at least.
he must know that our father can give him nothing.
Yes, that is true.
but how could he do this?
she is silly enough for anything.
but Wickham to love Lydia? Marry Lydia?
there is one lady I shall be very loath to part from.
we expect them soon returned from Gretna, man and wife.
I must conclude. I cannot be away from our poor mother long.
I shall write again as soon as I have news.
my dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what to write, but I have bad news!
imprudent as a marriage would be, we now fear worse:
that it has not taken place.
that Wickham never intended to marry Lydia at all!
great God, I knew it!
I cannot think so ill of him.
I can. Poor Lydia.
poor stupid girl!
Colonel Forster said he feared that
Wickham was not to be trusted.
she was then but fifteen years old.
they were traced as far as Clapham.
father has gone with Colonel Forster to try to discover them.
I cannot help but beg you all to come here as soon as possible!
Oh, yes! Where is my uncle?
if you please, ma'am.
miss Bennet, I hope this...
I beg your pardon. I must find Mr Gardiner.
on business that cannot be delayed.
good God! What is the matter?
of course I will not detain you, but let me go, or let the servant go and fetch Mr and Mrs Gardiner.
you cannot go yourself.
I must...
come. I insist. This will be for the best.
hello there!
have Mr and Mrs Gardiner fetched here at once.
they walked in the direction of the church.
Yes, sir, at once.
you are not well. May I not call a doctor?
no. I am well. I am well.
is there nothing you can take for your present relief?
a glass of wine? Can I get you one?
truly, you look very ill.
no, I thank you. There is nothing the matter with me.
I am quite well.
I am only distressed by some dreadful news, which I have just received from Longbourn.
I am sorry. Forgive me.
no, no.
I have just received a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news.
it cannot be concealed from anyone.
my youngest sister has left all her friends, has eloped, has thrown herself into the power of Mr Wickham.
they have run away together from Brighton.
you know him too well to doubt the rest.
she has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him.
when I think that I might have prevented it!
I, who knew what he was!
had his character been known, this could not have happened.
but it is all too late now.
I am grieved, indeed. Grieved, shocked.
but is it certain? Absolutely certain?
Oh, yes.
they left Brighton together on Sunday night.
they were traced as far as London, but not beyond.
they are certainly not gone to Scotland.
what has been attempted to recover her?
my father has gone to London.
and Jane writes to beg my uncle's immediate assistance.
I hope that we shall leave within half an hour.
but what can be done?
I know that nothing can be done.
how is such a man to be worked on?
how are they even to be discovered?
I have not the smallest hope.
she is lost forever, and our whole family must partake of her ruin and disgrace.
I'm afraid you have long been desiring my absence.
this unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister from having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley today.
Oh, yes.
be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy.
say that urgent business calls us home immediately.
and if you would be so kind... as to conceal the unhappy truth as long as possible.
I know that it cannot be long.
you may be assured of my secrecy.
but I have stayed too long. I shall leave you now.
Yes. Thank you.
goodbye.
I shall never see him again.
even if what you say of Wickham is true,
I still cannot believe this of Lydia.
ever since the militia came to Meryton, there's been nothing but love and officers in her head.
we must not assume the worst.
it may yet be that this is all a misunderstanding.
or just a passing folly that her friends can hush up and will in time be quite forgotten.
it is possible, Lizzy!
indeed it is.
why would any young man form a design against a girl who is not unprotected or friendless, and who is staying in the Colonel's family?
look at it in any way you like.
the temptation is not worth the risk.
not perhaps of risking his own interest.
but I do believe him capable of risking everything else!
you are very quiet this evening, Mr Darcy.
I hope you're not pining for the loss of Miss Eliza Bennet.
what?
excuse me.
there she is! Mamma, mamma! Did you bring us anything?
Lizzy! I am so glad to see you.
has anything been heard?
not yet, but now that our uncle has come,
I hope all will be well.
father left for town on Tuesday, and we've only heard that he has arrived in safety.
mamma has been asking for you every five minutes.
how is she?
she has not yet left her room.
and you look pale.
Oh, Jane, how much you must have gone through!
I am so happy to see you, Lizzy. Come.
Oh!
Oh, Lizzy!
Oh, brother!
we are all ruined forever!
if only Mr Bennet had taken us all to Brighton, none of this would have happened!
I blame those Forsters!
I am sure there was some great neglect on their part, for she is not the kind of girl to do that sort of thing, if she had been properly looked after!
mamma.
and now here is Mr Bennet gone away.
I know he will fight Wickham, and then he will be killed, and then what is to become of us all?
those Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave!
and if you are not kind to us, brother,
I don't know what we shall do!
sister, calm down. Nothing dreadful will happen!
I'll be in London tomorrow, and we will consult as to what is to be done.
Yes, yes, that is it! You must find them out, and if they be not married, you must make them marry.
above all, keep Mr Bennet from fighting!
mamma, I am sure he does not mean to fight.
Oh yes, he does!
and Wickham will kill him for sure, unless you can prevent it, brother!
you must tell him what a dreadful state I'm in!
how I have such tremblings and flutterings.
such spasms in my side and pains in my head and beatings at my heart, that I can get no rest either night or day!
sister, calm yourself.
and tell Lydia not to give any directions about wedding clothes till she's seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses!
this is the most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
Yes, thank you, Mary.
I think we have all apprehended that much.
we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into each other's wounded bosoms the balm of sisterly consolation.
Mary, pass the potatoes to your aunt Gardiner.
I beg your pardon?
never mind. I will.
thank you, Kitty.
that's the first kind word I've had from anyone since Lydia went away.
it is most unfair, for I have not done anything naughty!
and I don't see that Lydia has done anything dreadful either.
Kitty, please!
unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we must draw from it this useful lesson:
that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable.
my dear Mary, this is hardly helpful.
for a woman's reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful.
therefore we cannot be too guarded in our behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.
yes... thank you, Mary.
now, Jane... tell me everything about it that I have not already heard.
what did Colonel Forster say?
had they no apprehension about anything before the elopement took place?
Colonel Forster did own he suspected some partiality on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm.
Lizzy, I feel I am to blame.
I urged you not to make Wickham's bad conduct known.
now poor Lydia is suffering for it.
no one else suspected him for a moment.
I am, I am to blame!
you are not to blame! No more than I, or Mr Darcy or anyone else deceived by Wickham.
you have nothing to blame yourself for.
others are culpable, not you.
she wrote a note for Mrs Forster before she went away.
'my dear Harriet, you will laugh when you know where I am gone, "
"and I can't help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning, as soon as I am missed. "
I'm going to Gretna Green, and if you can't guess with who, I'll think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love.
don't send them word at Longbourn of my going.
it will make the surprise all the greater, when I write to them and sign my name Lydia Wickham!
what a good joke it will be.
I can scarcely write for laughing!
thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!
what a letter to have written at such a moment.
but at least she believed they were to be married, whatever he might persuade her to afterwards.
our poor father! How he must have felt it.
I never saw anyone so shocked.
he couldn't speak for ten minutes.
mother was in hysterics, and the house was in confusion.
lady Lucas has been very kind, offering her services.
she had better had stayed home!
assistance is impossible, and condolence insufferable.
let her triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied!
that is unkind.
I am sure she meant well.
Yes, perhaps she did.
I am sorry. It's just that I can't help but be...
Oh, Jane.
Jane, do you not see that more things have been ruined by this business than Lydia's reputation?
I have stayed too long. I shall leave you now.
come in!
I thought you would not be in bed yet.
I have been thinking about what you said this afternoon.
that it is not only Lydia's reputation that has been ruined.
I was angry and upset. I should not have said it.
it does no good to dwell on it.
you meant, I suppose, that you and I, and Mary and Kitty, have been tainted by association.
that our chances of making a good marriage have been materially damaged by Lydia's disgrace.
the chances of any of us making a good marriage were never very great.
and now I should say, they are non-existent.
no one will solicit our society after this.
mr Darcy made that very clear to me.
mr Darcy?
does he know our troubles?
he happened upon me a moment after I first read your letter.
he was very kind, very gentleman-like...
.but he made it very clear he wanted nothing more than to be out of my sight.
he will not be renewing his addresses to me.
he'll make very sure his friend doesn't renew his to you.
I never expected Mr Bingley would renew his addresses.
I am quite reconciled to that.
surely you do not desire Mr Darcy's attentions, do you?
no, no. I never sought them.
but you do think he was intending to renew them?
you think he is still in love with you?
I don't know.
I don't know what he was two days ago.
all I know is that now he, or any other respectable man, will want nothing to do with any of us.
Lord! Look who's coming!
who is it, Kitty?
mr Collins, of course.
I'm not going to sit with him for anyone!
I had hoped to condole with your poor father and your mother.
father is still in London, and mother is not yet well enough to leave her room.
Ah. Ah.
I feel myself called on, not only by our relationship, but by my situation as a clergyman, to condole with you all on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under.
thank you, sir.
it has often been said that a friend in need is a friend, indeed, sir.
Yes.
be assured, ladies, that Mrs Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you in your distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, proceeding from a cause which no time can remove.
the death of your sister would have been a blessing in comparison.
and it is more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose, my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your sister has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence, though I am inclined to think that her disposition must be naturally bad.
now, howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied...
we are very grateful, sir, for your...
.In which opinion I am joined by Lady Catherine de Bourgh and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair in full.
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one sister must be injurious to the fortunes of all the others.
'for who " , as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, " will connect themselves with such a family? "
who, indeed, sir.
now, perhaps, in view of that consideration, you may feel it would be unwise to stay any longer.
well, perhaps you are right.
Yes, perhaps you are right, cousin Elizabeth.
I always feel that a clergyman cannot be too careful.
especially one so fortunate as to enjoy the condescension and patronage of Lady Catherine.
I am very, very sorry for you all!
insufferable man!
I suppose he means well.
you suppose wrongly, Jane.
his purpose was to enjoy our misfortunes and congratulate himself on his own happy situation!
I think it kind of him to condole with us.
is he gone? - Yes.
good! - Forever, with any luck.
here's aunt Philips!
she can tell us the news from Meryton.
I doubt there's much we care to hear.
mother will be pleased.
well, girls, here's a to-do.
does your mother still keep to her bed?
no, but she keeps to her room.
well, well, the less the servants hear the better, I dare say.
come, let me to her, Jane, though Heaven knows I have no glad tidings for her.
every day I hear some new bad tale of Mr Wickham!
Oh, Mr Wickham, that everybody praised to the skies!
mr Wickham, that half the town was mad in love with.
all the time a villain!
a very demon from hell sent to ruin us!
I have heard he's run up debts with every reputable tradesman in the town.
Oh, sister!
I have heard tales of gaming debts!
Oh, sister!
of drunken routs, in which more things were broken than heads and furniture, sister!
Oh, sister, stop!
Debauches, intrigues, seductions!
they say there's hardly a tradesman in the town whose daughters were not meddled with!
now he's meddling with our dearest girl.
the foul fiend!
he shall be discovered and made to marry her!
I have to say, sister, that I always distrusted his appearance of goodness.
aye, sister, so did I, and warned the girls!
but would anybody listen to me?
and now we are all, all ruined!
Oh, my poor girl. My poor, poor Lydia!
when shall we travel into Hertfordshire, my love?
come away from the window, dear.
when I have settled my business affairs.
these things always take longer than one thinks they will.
you're not unhappy, surely?
Lord, no!
just that I can't wait to see my mother's face!
and my sisters'. Kitty will be so envious!
how I shall laugh!
I hope we shall be married from Longbourn.
then all my sisters will have to be my bridesmaids.
Oh, I do wish we could go out into the town, and be seen at plays and assemblies.
all in good time. Be patient, dear.
Lord, it makes me want to burst out laughing when I think that I have done what none of my sisters has.
and I the youngest of them all!
mother! Here is a letter from my uncle Gardiner!
father is coming home today!
does he bring Lydia?
no. He and my uncle have not yet discovered where she is.
my uncle will continue his enquiries alone.
coming home without poor Lydia?
who will fight Wickham and make him marry her, if he comes away?
Oh, Jane, Jane, what is to become of us?
Oh, oh, fetch my smelling salts!
I feel my faintness coming upon me again!
not now, Jane. Not now, Lizzy.
Mrs Younge.
should I go and get father?
he has had nothing to eat since he came home.
let me. You take mother her tea.
well, Jane.
Elizabeth.
Mary, Kitty.
you look so tired, father.
it must have been a dreadful time for you.
say nothing of that.
who should suffer but myself?
it has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it.
Oh, papa.
you must not be so severe upon yourself.
let me, for once in my life, feel how much I have been to blame.
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
it will pass away soon enough.
do you still suppose them to be in London, sir?
Yes, where else can they be so well concealed?
Lydia always wanted to go to London!
she is happy, then. And her residence there will probably be of some duration.
Lizzy.
I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me in May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind, I think.
I must take mamma her tea.
she still keeps her state above stairs, does she?
good. It lends such an elegance to our misfortune!
another time I'll do the same.
I'll sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and I'll give as much trouble as I can.
or perhaps I may defer it, till Kitty runs away.
I'm not going to run away. If I should go to Brighton,
I would behave better than Lydia.
you go to Brighton? I wouldn't trust you as near it as East Bourne.
not for fifty pounds!
no, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it.
no officer is ever to enter my house again.
or even to pass through the village!
balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters!
and you are never to stir out of doors until having spent ten minutes every day in a rational manner.
well, well, well, don't make yourself unhappy, my dear.
if you are a good girl for the next ten years,
I'll take you to a review at the end of them.
Oh, dearest, shall we not go out tonight?
can we not go to the theatre?
Lord! What in the world is he doing here?
what?
what a joke! - Who is it?
you'll never guess! - Who is it?
mr Darcy.
come in.
thank you, Hill.
hill, what is it?
is Mrs Bennet asking for us?
no, ma'am.
I beg your pardon, but did you know an express come for master from Mr Gardiner?
when did it come, Hill?
Oh, about half an hour ago, ma'am.
well, Lizzy?
Papa, what news?
what news from my uncle?
Yes, I've had a letter from him.
what news does it bring? Good or bad?
what is there of good to be expected?
perhaps you would like to read it yourself.
read it aloud, Lizzy.
I hardly know what to make of it myself.
'my dear brother, at last I am able to send tidings of my niece and Mr Wickham. I have seen them... "
it's as I hoped! They are married!
'they are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so, "
'but if you will perform the engagements I have ventured to make for you, they will before long. "
what engagements? - Read on.
"all that is required is to assure your daughter her equal share of the 5, 000 pounds she will inherit,"
'and also allow her, during your life, 100 pounds per annum. "
so little? What about Wickham's debts?
read on.
'Mr Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. "
there! - Read on, Lizzy!
'there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece. "
I cannot believe it. - Read on.
'we've judged it best that my niece should be married from this house. I hope you approve. "
Kitty will be disappointed not to be a bridesmaid.
'send back your answer as soon as you can, with the explicit financial settlement. Yours, " etc...
how can it be possible he will marry her for so little?
he must not be undeserving, as we thought.
he must truly be in love with her, I think.
you think that, Jane, if it gives you comfort.
have you answered the letter?
no, but I must - and soon.
and they must marry. Yet he is such a man.
Yes, they must marry. There's nothing else to be done.
there are two things I want to know:
one is, how much money your uncle laid down to bring this about;
and the other, how am I ever to repay him?
I wish I had never spoken of this to Mr Darcy.
dear Lizzy, please do not distress yourself.
I'm sure Mr Darcy will respect your confidence.
I'm sure he will. That is not what distresses me.
what, then? - I don't know!
how he must be congratulating himself on his escape!
how he must despise me now.
you never sought his love!
nor welcomed it when he offered it.
if he has withdrawn his high opinion of you, why should you care?
I don't know!
I can't explain it.
I know I shall probably never see him again.
I cannot bear to think that he is alive in the world...
and thinking ill of me.
I knew it would come out right in the end!
my dear, dear Lydia! She will be married.
my good, kind brother!
I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything!
Oh, but the clothes! And of course she must be married from Longbourn.
this is all nonsense about her being married from Cheapside!
she must be married in Longbourn church, where her friends can see her.
that is not possible. You must see that.
I do not see that! Why should I see that?
why should that be?
she's been living with Mr Wickham in London.
if she were to arrive home unmarried still...
I suppose it must be, if you put it like that!
but it is all very vexing.
your uncle has been most highhanded!
why should he take so much upon him?
mamma, we're greatly indebted to Mr Gardiner.
he must have laid out a great deal of money to pay off Mr Wickham's debts.
more than we can ever repay.
why should he not?
who else should lay out money, but her uncle?
mother!
Oh, well! I am so happy!
a daughter married. And only just sixteen.
'mrs Wickham " . Oh, how well that sounds!
Oh, but the wedding clothes!
Lizzy, go down to your father and ask how much he will give her.
Oh, Jane, as soon as I am dressed
I shall go to Meryton and tell my sister Philips!
ring the bell for Hill!
an airing will do me a great deal of good, I'm sure.
and I shall call on Lady Lucas and Mrs Long.
Oh, Jane!
Papa.
Jane, it's such wonderful news!
Oh, where is Hill?
Oh, Hill, have you heard the good news?
shut the door, Lizzy.
and you shall have a bowl of punch to make merry at...
someone, at least, finds pleasure in these events.
but considering what we thought only a few hours ago, it's not so bad, is it?
do you think my uncle paid out much money?
I do.
Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than 10, 000 pounds.
10, 000 pounds!
heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?
I wish I had laid by an annual sum to bribe worthless young men to marry my daughters, but I have not, I confess.
the reason was, of course, that I intended to father a son.
the son would inherit the estate, no part of which would be entailed away, so providing for my widow and any other children.
by the time we had abandoned hope of producing an heir, it seemed a little late to begin saving.
you could not have foreseen this, father.
I should have taken better care of you all.
the satisfaction of prevailing upon one of the most worthless young men in Britain, might then have rested in its proper place.
as it is, the thing is done with extraordinary little inconvenience to myself.
when you take into account what I shall save on
Lydia's board and pocket allowance,
I am scarcely ten pounds a year worse off.
I am heartily ashamed of myself, Lizzy.
but don't despair, it will pass...
.and no doubt more quickly than it should.
where is everyone?
dearly beloved.
we are gathered here in the sight of God.
mr Wickham is to resign from the Militia and go into a northern regiment.
happily some of his former friends are willing to assist him in purchasing a commission.
I have written to Colonel Forster to request that he will satisfy Wickham's creditors in Brighton, for which I've pledged myself.
"perhaps you will be so good as to do the same for his creditors in Meryton, "
"of whom I enclose a list according to his information. "
"I hope, at least, he has not deceived us " .
let us all hope so.
"as soon as they are married, they will journey directly to join his regiment in Newcastle, "
"unless they are first invited to Longbourn. "
Oh, yes, my dear Mr Bennet, of course they must come here!
I long to see my dear Lydia!
and dear Wickham, too, of course.
but it is shocking that poor Lydia should have been sent away from Brighton.
such a favourite among all the officers!
there were several young men there that she liked very much.
they will miss her as much as she will miss them.
these northern officers may not be so pleasant.
dear Mrs Bennet, I'm sure our youngest daughter will find friends as silly as she in Newcastle.
she has a talent for making a spectacle of herself wherever she goes.
if they are to leave Brighton, they should come to Hertfordshire and reside in the neighbourhood.
haye Park might do, if the Gouldings would quit it.
or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-rooms were larger.
or Purvis Lodge.
Oh, no dear, not Purvis Lodge!
the attics are dreadful!
Mrs Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, let us come to a right understanding.
into one house in the neighbourhood they shall never have admittance.
mr and Mrs Wickham will never be welcome to Longbourn.
Lord! It seems an age since we were at Longbourn.
here you all are, just the same!
my dear, dear Lydia, at last!
Oh, I do believe you've grown! Oh, how we have missed you.
we've been far too merry to miss any of you!
here we are! Haven't I caught myself a handsome husband?
indeed you have, my love! You are very welcome, sir.
you are all goodness and kindness, ma'am, as always.
Oh, let me give you a kiss, then!
well, shall we go in?
no, Jane. I take your place now.
you must go lower, because I am a married woman!
'mrs Wickham " !
Lord, how droll that sounds!
how do you like my husband, Lizzy? I believe you envy me.
was he not a favourite of yours once?
not at all.
a pity we didn't all go to Brighton.
I could have got husbands for all my sisters!
thank you, but I don't particularly like your way of getting husbands.
isn't my husband a fine horseman?
Colonel Forster said he has as good a seat as any officer in the regiment.
I wished he could wear his red coat at the wedding, and have a guard of honour, but the officers could not be spared from duty.
there was no one there but my aunt and uncle and Mr Darcy.
mr Darcy?
mr Darcy was at your wedding?
Oh, yes. Someone had to be groomsman.
I had much rather it had been Denny or one of our friends...
Oh, Lord!
Oh, Lord, I forgot.
I wasn't to say a word!
and I promised them so faithfully.
what'll Wickham say now?
it was supposed to be a secret!
my dear Aunt, pray write and let me understand how he should have been there.
unless you, too, are bound in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary.
my dear niece, I must confess myself surprised by your letter.
if you are in ignorance of the part that
mr Darcy played in bringing about the marriage, let me enlighten you at once.
mr Darcy paid us an unexpected visit...
.and so, my dear Lizzy,
mr Darcy would brook no opposition.
he insisted on doing everything himself and bearing the entirety of the expense.
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself.
your uncle, instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, had to accept having the credit of it.
I must be allowed to insist on this.
the fault is mine, and so must the remedy be.
it was through my mistaken pride that
mr Wickham's character has not been made known.
had I not thought it beneath me to lay my private actions open, his character would have been exposed.
mr Darcy, I really believe you take too much upon yourself.
I must insist on this, sir.
I assure you that in this matter, argument is fruitless.
the responsibility is mine. I must have it, sir.
I shall not give way.
my dear sister!
I'm afraid I'm interrupting your solitary reverie.
you are, indeed.
but it doesn't follow that the interruption must be unwelcome.
I should be sorry if it were.
you and I were always good friends.
true.
then shall we take a turn together, sister?
I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month.
we passed each other several times.
I wonder what he could be doing there.
perhaps preparing for the wedding...with Miss de Bourgh.
Yes. Yes, perhaps.
must have been something particular, to take him there this time of year.
Undoubtedly.
did you see him while you were at Lambton?
I understood from the Gardiners that you had.
Yes. He introduced us to his sister.
did you like her?
Yes, very much indeed.
well, I have heard that she is uncommonly improved within this last year or two.
when I last saw her, she was not very promising.
I'm glad you liked her. I hope she'll turn out well.
I dare say she will. She has got over the most trying age.
did you go by Kympton?
I don't recollect...
I mention it because it was the living
I should have had.
how should you have liked making sermons?
exceedingly well.
I did hear that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as at present.
that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and were compensated accordingly.
well.
Oh come, Mr Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know.
let us not quarrel about the past.
Oh, Lydia, when shall we meet again?
not these two or three years, perhaps.
not these two or three years. Oh, what shall I do?
and Mr Bennet is so cruel as to refuse to take us into the North Country!
I should refuse to go in any case.
hold your tongue, girl!
Oh, Lydia! You will write to me often, won't you?
I don't know. We married women don't have much time for writing.
my sisters may write to me.
they will have nothing better to do.
Oh, Lydia! Mr Wickham, take care of my girl!
I shall, ma'am, to the very best of my ability.
and thank you, ma'am, and to you, sir, for your continued kindness and hospitality.
and to you, my dear sisters-in-law.
and now as dear to me as sisters ever could be.
but, the carriage awaits.
duty and honour call me to the North. So, come, my dear!
let us say not farewell, but as the French have it: Au revoir!
he's as fine a fellow as ever I saw!
he simpers and smirks, and makes love to us all.
I am prodigiously proud of him.
I defy even Sir William Lucas to produce such a son-in-law.
sister! Sister! Have you heard the news?
mr Bingley is coming back to Netherfield, and the whole town is talking about it!
I do assure you, this news does not affect me, truly, Lizzy.
I am glad of one thing. That he doesn't bring any ladies.
if it is merely a shooting party, we shall not see him often.
not that I am afraid of myself...
but I dread other people's remarks, Lizzy.
then I shall venture none however sorely I am tempted.
it is hard that the man can't come to a house he's legally rented, without raising all this speculation.
that is just what I think.
then we shall leave him to himself.
Yes.
stop it, Lizzy.
three days he has been in the neighbourhood, and still he shuns us!
I say it's all your father's fault!
he would not do his duty and call, so you shall die old maids, and we shall be turned out by the Collinses to starve in the hedgerows!
you promised last year that if I went to see him, he'd marry one of my daughters, but it all came to nothing.
I won't be sent on a fool's errand again!
mamma! Mamma, look! I think he is coming!
is it really him? I believe it must be!
he is come, Jane! He is come at last.
put on your blue gown. No, stay where you are!
who's with him?
I don't know, dear. Some acquaintance, I suppose!
it looks like that man who used to be with him before. Mr...
you know, that tall proud one.
mr Darcy!
I believe it is.
well, any friend of Mr Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure.
but I must say I hate the sight of him!
but I am determined to be civil.
if only because the man is a friend of Bingley's, but no more than civil. Sit up straight, Jane!
pull your shoulders back.
a man could go a long way without seeing a figure like yours, if you'd make the most of it.
mr Bingley and Mr Darcy, ma'am.
mr Bingley, you are very, very welcome.
how do you do, Mrs Bennet. I...
it's far too long since you were here, and very kind of you to call.
mr Bennet, of course, would have paid his addresses before this, were it not...
well, here you are! I am delighted!
and Mr Darcy, you are welcome, too.
we began to be afraid you would never come back.
people did say, you meant to quit the place by Michaelmas, but I hope that is not true.
ring the bell for tea, Kitty.
a great many changes have taken place since you went away.
miss Lucas is married.
and one of my own daughters!
you've heard of it or read it in the papers?
Yes, indeed...
it was not put in properly. It only said:
"lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet " , without a syllable said about who her father was, or where she lived!
now they are gone to Newcastle, and there they are to stay.
I don't know how long.
I expect you've heard he's gone into the regulars.
thank Heaven he has some friends, though perhaps not as many as he deserves!
do you mean to stay long in the neighbourhood on this visit?
our plans are not yet firmly settled, but I hope, I hope we shall stay some weeks.
I hope very much we shall stay a few weeks.
at the very least.
when you've killed your own birds,
I beg you would come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr Bennet's manor.
I'm sure he'll be happy to oblige you!
I suppose you may bring your friends, if you will.
now that this first meeting is over,
I feel at ease.
good!
now I know my own strength, and I shall never again be embarrassed by his coming.
we shall be able to meet now as...
common and indifferent acquaintances.
Yes, very indifferent! Jane, take care.
don't think me to be in any danger now, Lizzy.
I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.
you tell me now that she was in London all those months?
and you concealed it from me?
Yes. I can offer no justification.
it was an arrogant presumption, based on a failure to recognise your true feelings and Miss Bennet's.
I should never have interfered.
it was wrong of me, Bingley, and I apologise.
you admit that you were in the wrong?
utterly and completely.
then... I have you blessing?
do you need my blessing?
no. But I should like to know I have it all the same.
then go to it.
bring me my horse at once. Quick, man!
Jane!
Jane! Oh, my dear Jane!
mamma, what's the matter? - He is come!
who is come? - Mr Bingley, of course!
make haste, make haste, hurry down!
Oh, gracious, you are not half dressed!
hill! Hill!
Oh, where is Hill?
never mind, Sarah. You must come to Miss Bennet this moment!
come along and help her on with her gown!
mamma! Mamma!
where is my new locket that Lydia brought me?
Mary, have you seen it?
I shouldn't know it if I saw it.
I care nothing for such baubles.
Oh, never mind your locket, girl!
Jane, stir yourself. He is here, he is here!
we will be down as soon as we can.
let Kitty go down, she is forwarder.
hang Kitty! What has she to do with it? Jane, be quick!
where is your muslin dress?
hill! Hill! Where is Hill?
so Mr Darcy is gone to town?
Yes, ma'am. He left quite early this morning.
what's the matter, mamma?
why do you keep winking at me?
what am I to do?
wink at you? Why should I wink at you, child?
what a notion! Why should I be winking at my own daughter, pray?
but now you ask, it puts me in mind.
I do have something I would speak to you about.
come, come with me.
and you, Mary. Come!
miss Elizabeth...
you're needed upstairs.
please let me go to Jane.
I promised I would stay with her.
stay where you are. Five more minutes will do the trick.
Oh, I am so sorry.
no. No, don't go, Lizzy.
well?
Oh, Lizzy!
I'm so happy! It is too much!
it is too much! Why can't everyone be as happy as I am?
he loves me, Lizzy. He loves me!
of course he does!
he told me he loved me all the time. He didn't believe...
I must tell mamma. He is gone to papa already!
Oh, Lizzy, could you believe things would end in this happy way?
I could, and I do!
I must go to my mother.
Oh, Lizzy!
to know I shall be giving such pleasure to all my dear family!
how shall I bear so much happiness?
come back tomorrow, sir, if you can bear to.
come and shoot with me, if you will.
there are few men whose society I can tolerate well.
I believe you may be one of them.
thank you, sir. I shall be very happy to.
very well, very well. Get along with you.
till tomorrow, then!
Jane, congratulations. You will be a very happy woman.
thank you, father.
I believe I shall.
well, well, you're a good girl.
I've no doubt you'll do very well together.
you're each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on.
Papa!
so easy that every servant will cheat you!
no, indeed!
so generous that you will exceed your income.
exceed their income! What are you talking about?
don't you know that he has 5, 000 a year?!
Oh, my dear, dear Jane! I am so happy!
Oh, I knew how it would be!
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing.
he is the handsomest man that was ever seen!
Oh, Lizzy. If only I could see you as happy.
if there were only such another man for you.
if you were to give me forty such men...
.I could never be as happy as you.
till I have your goodness,
I can never have your happiness.
but... perhaps if I have very good luck,
I may in time meet with another Mr Collins!
mamma, Lizzy, come and look!
the most enormous carriage has arrived.
what an extremely small hall!
if you'll wait here, your ladyship,
I'll tell my mistress you're here.
no, I will not wait!
where is she? Is this the drawing-room?
lady Catherine de Bourgh.
that lady, I suppose, is your mother.
Yes, she is. Mamma, this is Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
and that, I suppose, is one of your sisters.
Yes, ma'am. She is my youngest girl but one.
my youngest of all is lately married.
you have a very small park here.
and this must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in summer.
why, the windows are full west.
indeed, they are, your ladyship, but we never sit in here after dinner.
we have... - Miss Bennet.
there seemed to be a prettyish kind of little wilderness on one side of your lawn.
I should be glad to take a turn in it...
if you would favour me with your company.
you can be at no loss to understand the reason for my journey, Miss Bennet.
you are mistaken, madam.
I'm quite unable to account for the honour of seeing you here.
miss Bennet, you ought to know I am not to be trifled with.
but however insincere you choose to be, you shall not find me so.
a report of an alarming nature reached me two days ago.
I was told, not only that your sister was to be most advantageously married, but that you, Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would be soon afterwards united to my nephew Mr Darcy!
though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood,
I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, to make my sentiments known to you.
if you believed it to be impossible,
I wonder what your ladyship would propose by coming here?
at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted!
your coming to Longbourn will be taken as a confirmation of it, if such a report exists.
this is not to be borne. Miss Bennet,
I insist on being satisfied!
has my nephew made you an offer of marriage?
your ladyship declared it to be impossible.
it ought to be so, but your arts and allurements may have made him forget what he owes to himself and the family.
you may have drawn him in!
if I had, I should be the last to confess it.
miss Bennet, do you know who I am?
I have not been accustomed to such language as this.
I am almost the nearest relation he has, and I am entitled to know all his nearest concerns.
but not to know mine, nor will such behaviour as this induce me to be explicit.
let me be rightly understood.
this match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place.
mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter.
now, what have you to say?
only this: that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he'll make an offer to me.
the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind.
from their infancy they have been intended for each other.
it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as hers.
while she was in her cradle, we planned the union.
and now to be prevented by the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections or fortune? Is this to be endured? It shall not be!
your alliance would be a disgrace!
your name would never even be mentioned by any of us.
these would be heavy misfortunes, indeed.
obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you.
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment!
that will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable, but it will have no effect on me.
I will not be interrupted!
if you were sensible, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up!
lady Catherine, in marrying your nephew I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere.
he's a gentleman, I'm a gentleman's daughter.
so far we are equal.
but who was your mother? Your uncles and aunts?
do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.
if your nephew does not object to my connections, they can be nothing to you.
tell me once and for all, are you engaged to him?
I am not.
and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?
I will make no promise of the kind, and I beg you not to importune me any further on the subject.
not so hasty, if you please!
I have another objection.
your youngest sister's infamous elopement.
I know it all!
is such a girl to be my nephew's sister-in-law?
are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?
you can have nothing further to say.
you have insulted me by every possible method.
I must beg to return to the house.
you have no regard then, for the honour and credit of my nephew?
unfeeling, selfish girl!
you refuse to oblige me?
you refuse the claims of duty, honour, gratitude?
you are determined to ruin him, and make him the contempt of the world!
I am only resolved to act in a manner which will constitute my own happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.
and this is your final resolve?
very well. I shall know how to act!
I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet.
I send no compliments to your mother.
you deserve no such attention.
I am most seriously displeased. Drive on!
Lizzy, Lizzy! I was going to look for you. Come into my room.
I received a letter this morning, which has astonished me exceedingly.
from Mr Collins.
what can he have to say?
he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, but I shan't sport with your intelligence by reading his remarks on that topic.
Ah, yes. Here, here, here.
'your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, "
'after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate "
"may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in the land. "
can you guess who he means, Lizzy?
now it comes out.
'my motive for cautioning you is as follows: "
'his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye. "
mr Darcy, you see, is the man. Mr Darcy of all men!
who never looks at a woman except to see a blemish!
are you not diverted?
Yes.
mr Darcy, who probably never looked at you in his life before!
this is admirable!
but Lizzy, you look as if you didn't enjoy it.
you're not going to be Missish now, and pretend to be affronted by an idle report?
Oh, no, I am excessively diverted.
it's all so strange.
what said Lady Catherine de Bourgh?
I suppose she came to refuse her consent?
what do we live for, but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn?
true True
mr Bingley and Mr Darcy, ma'am.
good day to you! - Mr Bingley.
this is a fine day.
should we perhaps all walk to Meryton?
Lizzy!
do you mind if I run to call on Maria Lucas?
no, not at all.
mr Darcy.
I can go no longer without thanking you for your kindness to my poor sister.
ever since I have known of it,
I've been most anxious to tell you how grateful I am, for my family and for myself.
you must not blame my aunt for telling me.
Lydia betrayed it first, and then I couldn't rest till I knew everything.
I know what trouble and what mortification it must have cost you.
please let me say this, please allow me to thank you, on behalf of all my family, since they don't know to whom they are indebted.
if you will thank me, let it be for yourself alone.
your family owes me nothing. As much as I respect them,
I believe I thought only of you.
you're too generous to trifle with me.
if your feelings are what they were last April, tell me so.
my affections and wishes are unchanged.
but one word from you will silence me on this subject forever.
Oh, my feelings...
my feelings are...
I am ashamed to remember what I said then.
my feelings are so different.
in fact, they are quite the opposite.
lady Catherine told me of her meeting with you.
I may say that her disclosure had quite the opposite effect to the one she had intended.
it taught me to hope, that I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before.
had you absolutely decided against me, you would have acknowledged it openly.
Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that!
after abusing you so to your face,
I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations.
what did you say of me that I did not deserve?
my behaviour at the time was unpardonable.
I can hardly think of it without abhorrence.
your reproof I shall never forget.
'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner " .
how those words have tortured me!
I had no idea of their being taken such a way.
I can easily believe it.
you thought me devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure.
the turn of your countenance I shall never forget.
you said I could not have addressed you in any way that would have induced you to accept me.
do not repeat what I said then!
no, I have been a selfish being all my life.
as a child I was given good principles, but was left to follow them in pride and conceit.
and such I might still have been, but for you.
dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!
engaged to Mr Darcy!
no, you are joking. It is impossible!
this is a wretched beginning!
if you don't believe me, I'm sure no one else will.
indeed, I am in earnest.
he still loves me, and we are engaged.
it can't be true. I know how much you dislike him!
no, it is all forgotten!
perhaps I didn't always love him as well as I do now.
but... in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable.
dearest Lizzy, do be serious.
how long have you loved him?
it's been coming on so gradually, I hardly know.
but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley!
Lizzy!
are you out of your senses to be accepting this man, Lizzy?
have you not always hated him?
Papa...
I've given him my consent.
he's the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything.
but let me advise you to think the better of it.
I know your disposition, Lizzy.
my child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life.
he is rich, but will he make you happy?
have you objections apart from your belief in my indifference?
none whatever. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man, but this would be nothing if you really liked him.
I do. I do like him.
I love him.
indeed, he has no improper pride.
he is perfectly amiable.
if you only knew his generous nature.
I didn't always love him, but I love him now so very dearly.
he is truly the best man I have ever known.
well, my dear, if this be the case, he deserves you.
I could not have parted with you to anyone less worthy, Lizzy.
dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman...
and this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honourable estate, instituted by God in the time of man's innocency, signifying unto us the mystical union that is between Christ and His church, and therefore is not by any to be enterprised lightly, or wantonly, to satisfy man's carnal lusts and appetites, but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of God, duly considering the causes for which matrimony was ordained.
first, it was ordained for the procreation of children.
secondly, as a remedy against sin, and to avoid fornication.
thirdly, for the mutual society, help and comfort that the one ought to have of the other, both in prosperity and adversity, into which holy estate these persons present come now to be joined.
three daughters married!
Oh, Mr Bennet, God has been very good to us!
Yes, so it would seem.
tastes like more.
table near the wall needs three ciders, please. - you sure you're not gonna get in trouble?
for what?
Jane's boyfriend's little boy is in a school play tonight.
it's ten minutes long.
you blink, and you'll miss it, and I'm not gonna spend the whole night facing off with matt's ex-wife to watch a ten-minute play about how hippos learn to share.
and plus, you need me here.
I'm working, right? - you're working?
I've been waiting since the damn earth cooled. - there's that missing chick again.
her husband is pleading for her safe return.
Claudia ward is 5'7," blond hair, green eyes, with a tattoo of a butterfly on her left wrist.
Hey, janie, she looks kind of like you, if you'd smile ever, and 20 years younger.
Thanks, iggy. you just keep hitting that bowl of peanuts like there's diamonds at the bottom-how about that?
I'm only kidding you. - I'm sorry, sir. what would you like to drink?
this is a robbery, okay? okay? everybody, hands on the bar!
hands on the bar! - okay, calm down.
hands on the bar, everybody! put your hands on the bar!
the register. the register!
sure, sure, sure. it's just money, all right?
the bottom one, too. - got it. of course.

I wouldn't try to trick you, all right? are we good?
all right, now get back from around there. come on, get from behind the bar!
everybody, empty your pockets!
empty your pockets!
what do you want to do? - nothing.
I don't have my gun on me, plus we don't know if he has a partner outside, so let's just try to keep him calm and not get anybody shot. - shut up!
Y- you're all right, evelyn. - sure she is.
Hey, everybody, why don't you just give the gentleman what he wants so he can go- does that sound good?
come on, that's my last 20, you
everybody in the back, now! everybody in the back!
come on! move it! - come on, everybody.
everybody move to the back now!
hurry up!
all right, stay here- 30 minut.
anyone who comes out sooner gets shot.
well, thank god there was a cop in the bar.
I don't have my gun on me.
and what were you thinking mouth off to a guy who had one in your face?
that necklace was a priceless family heirloom.
that necklace was a prize from a box of cereal, evelyn.
you're talking out of your hole now. oh, for the love of
who is that? - me.
what's everyone talking about now? - nothing, malachi.
why would you not have your gun on you? i was a cop, i'd never not have the gun on me.
what did you dummies want- the-the damn showdown at the o. k. corral?
you're alive, aren't you?
you're welcome.
all right, so it was a gold chain- we got that.
very expensive, though. every expensive gold chain.
I understand. - did you write that down?
I did. it's right there, ma'am.
that's a pretty woman right there. - I'm happy are you.
we'll have somebody look at that, okay?
you just hang in there. i'm gonna go talk to these guys.
thank you.
detective rivera.
extra-hot latte. - oh, look at that.
Thanks. my fat ass thanks you. - that ass is not fat.
well, look at it while i walk away and then decide.
Hey, thanks for waiting. i'm detective rivera, robbery.
she's homicide- jane timoney.
Oh, yeah, sure. nice to finally meet you.
Gerry matthews gonna be here? - nah, he's taking his kids to the shore this week.
can i ask you some- - what about reed?
he's working the wolf pack robbery, and machado's in court, and boyd's in court, and jackson's working overnights, but i'm here.
can i ask you some questions?
of course. - i can just, uh
I can just tell you. he's about 6'1," 170.
where were you guys in the bar? was anyone between you and the robber?
you're seriously gonna do this by the manual? why don't i just tell you?
because sometimes our witnesses get confused.
I'm a detective, detective. - no matter who they are.
extra-hot latte, right?
you what? - extra-hot latte?
Oh, really? that's so sweet.
Thanks.
you got two lattes. - yeah. you want one?
you going home? - uh-uh.
I'm gonna go to the dorm and try to sleep for a couple of hours before my shift.
I'm really sorry, dad.
Yeah. next time wear the gun.
you know what?
why didn't you have your gun? cause i never not have my gun.
well, you're an inspiration to us all.
okay, we got a 20-something female, blond.
worker named montoya found her this morning. you're looking a little tired.
you look tired means "you look old."
you look short. how's that feel?
Hello, there. you're mr. montoya?
I'm detective timoney. this is detective calderon.
I almost ran her over. she looks bad.
well, it's a good thing you found her, mr. montoya, 'cause now we can do our job. that's a good thing.
I just never saw a dead body before.
Hey, look at me. mr. montoya, it's all right.
it's gonna be all right. just tell me this
this section of the dump is from soho.
is that correct? - yeah.
Yeah, that's right. - all right, guys...
pull any of the magazines or mail you found around the body, anything with an address
see if we can figure out which dumpster the body came from.
and, uh...
and show me her left arm, please.
this is claudia ward, the missing woman.
the body ?
police say they are now investigating and looking for possible suspects.
you are more beautiful than the stars.
she was tenderized, huh?
are you as sweet as your eyes are? - what do you think, iris?
what he said- somebody pounded her like a skirt steak.
if i help yo learn english. - what the hell is this, iris?
I'm going to paris this spring.
so, murder weapon? - don't know.
there's no imprint pattern. could've just been fists.
both cheekbones are fractured.
the bridge of her nose is collapsed. both eye orbits are fractured.
well, somebody was pretty pissed off at her.
we're gonna bring the husband in to i. d. her.
you want me to get a blanket or something?
no, i want to see how he reacts. - well, what if he didn't do it?
then i make lou here tell him we're sorry.
Oh, dear god, my sweet girl.
is this your, uh, wife, mr. ward?
is this claudia? - could you
could you- could you please cover her?
iris, thanks. - what-what happened?
who did this to her? - it's okay, mr. ward.
I'm so sorry. i know you're upset.
but could you come down to the squad with us, please? - yeah, of course.
could i-could i just use the bathroom, please?
Yeah, sure. we'll wait right here for you. - i'll show you where it is.
he's a good crier. i'll give him that.
it-it was through my volunteer work.
sh-she was only 17 when we met.
and what do you do, mr. ward?
I'm an interpreter for companies who do business in japan, but i sometimes volunteer at a youth shelter.
she was a ward there.
how old were you?
I know. i know. but nothing happened for years.
but then we-we fell in love.
she was the sweetest woman i ever met.
okay.
so, tell us about the night she disappeared.
she had a class
art history. and, um, we always met for dinner after at grey cat.
but, um, missing persons found out that the class had been canceled. so, um...
she must've decided to-to do some shopping or... i don't know what.
I- i went to the restaurant the same time as usual.
she texted me. she said she was running late but that she would be there soon.
what time did that text come in?
a- a-at around 7: 00, i...
I called her again, but it went right to voice mail.
and did you hear from her again after that?
no. a-a-at 7: 30, i- i left the restaurant, and i went home, 'cause i thought maybe that i'd misunderstood her and that she would be there instead.
and you know the rest.
you know, i-i-if you want to...
search our home or my office or
that's-that's-that's fine. all you have to do is ask.
thanks so much, but we're done here for now, sir.
you know, in a case like this, it helps uto get to know the victim.
so... we're gonna take you up on your offer
look around your place. - let's go now.
actually, we have a couple of things to do first on the case, but, uh, we'd like to stop by later, if that's all right.
okay. yeah, whatever- whatever you guys need.
I just-i want to find out who killed claudia.
so do we.
well, i guess he didn't kill her at their place or the office, then, right?
I love to know where the crime scene isn't.
what are these names again? - agnes bledsoe...
keep looking! - you know what?
if i find a dead baby in here, i'm going home.
listen, we got to pinpoint this address, okay? it's important.
I talked to the people upstairs.
didn't see nothing. didn't hear nothing.
so she couldn't have been killed here. someone would have seen or heard it.
well, it's a good spot to dump her, though
no cameras, a lot of windows. it's well planned...
smart.
Malcolm ward seemed smart. - he does, right?
Yeah. - guy knows japanese and crap.
let's talk to him again. we're done here. come on.
wait. what, "we're done here"?
then why exactly am i rooting around in this dumpster amongst the cat turds?
will someone please explain that to me?
Yeah, why are you doing that, augie? i was wondering the same thing.
Hey! lou said that you asked me to.
I thought it was funny.
Mr. ward, the dumpster that claudia's body was left in is in soho, and the text that she sent you came from the same area.
is that all you have? - i keep on coming back to the class being canceled.
now, it's odd that she didn't mention it to you.
maybe it was canceled at the last minute. - the professor said it was on the syllabus.
well, i just assume that she forgot. - well, e-either way, she didn't have class, so why would she want you to think she did?
she had an affair. - what?
six months ago, she had an affair. - excuse me.
and you didn't tnk this was worth mentioning the first time we talked?
seems like it's an important piece of information.
look, i didn't want to drag her name through the mud, okay?
it's our private business. we're private people.
and now that she's gone, i just-i don't want to remember stuff like that.
okay. so what was the name of this individual
the one she had the affair with? - david...
hollister. david hollister. - he built this dining-room table.
do you know where david hollister lives, sir?
no, i don't, but i know where he works
investigators' search for the killer is intensifying.
Yeah. yeah, we, uh- we had a thing.
she broke it off six mohs ago.
is that the last time you saw her? - yep.
were you angry at her? - why are you asking that?
because someone beat her till she died and then threw her in a dumpster about a half a block from here, and i was wondering if you were angry enough at her to do that.
where were you last friday?
I was here... working- i make furniture.
anybody see you making this furniture?
I don't know, you know. they heard me. i, uh...
I turn up the music loud, so, uh
so i don't bother the neighbors. - mm-hmm.
why don't you guys talk to her husband?
she was terrified of him. i used to worry he hit her.
Really? do you have any proof of that?
no. - i got to tell you something
this sounds like a made-up story to me, david.
look, i was here.
great. so hopefully your neighbors can verify that, because i got enough here to get a warrant to search this place, easy.
so did he do something? what did he do?
did you see mr. hollister last friday night, ma'am?
I didn't see him, but i heard his stupid music.
can you tell him the music is worse than the power tools?
we'll be sure to pass that along.
the hair and fingerprints could be from when they were banging.
which is exactly what even a crappy lawyer would say.
where was that woman killed? please tell me that.
well, what are you going to club med for? you don't have kids.
that's like going to a dog park without a dog. - hey, reg.
did you get the boyfriend's credit card statements?
I'm serious, brian.
you're gonna be miserable, not to mention the pool
full of baby piss. so enjoy that. - i need those statements, please.
well, don't say i didn't warn you, all right? - unbelievable.
all right, thanks a million, brian. appreciate it, man.
Hey, sunblock.
with all due respect, reg, and i sincerely mean this, i have sweeney breathing down my back to get this thing done.
and could you just maybe just do your job?
that was the head of security at american express- old buddy of mine.
Yeah.
I find that a lot of police work is about building relationships.
you know, you'd be surprised what simple politeness can accomplish in this world.
page three- guy says he never goes t to dinner, and yet there's a big charge a week before claudia gets murdered.
nice little romantic italian place on bond
wine bottle, candleholders, soulful glances, bric-a-brac
maybe you should check it out. don't bother thanking me. no, really...
don't thank me.
could you please, uh, get the ward's property records next?
I still don't have a crime scene.
Hey, jane...
I, uh, brought over some mug shots for you to look at. - actually, this is not a good time.
sorry. - yeah, sorry about last night.
I never had a cop as a witness before. - oh, i got that.
and maybe i was a little intimidated. you kind of have a reputation
a good one, but, anyway...
I narrowed down the pictures so it would be easier for you.
I'll look at them later, all right?
right now i'm trying to close a homicide.
I'm trying to close a robbery- your dad's, actually.
you a little tired, or you always act like this?
Reg! oh, my god, reg!
Oh, hey, sexy! how you doing? and you're wearing red.
Oh, i didn't know if you'd be here or not.
I'm good. how have you been? let me see you.
let me see you. - you have been working out.
Nah, nah, that's just there- all genetic, baby.
excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. uh, have we met?
Augie blando. nice to meet you. - hi.
Lou calderon. how are you? - hey.
evrard velerio. - hi.
Yeah, it's nice to meet you. - this is carolina rivera.
me and jay took her under our wing when she was just a baby d. t. back in robbery.
Hey, you know what? let's go out and get drunk...
for jay. - oh! i got to go to court.
how about later? let me get you my new cell number.
excuse me. - yeah.
Oh! - oh, wait, wait. i got it.
officer down.
hold on. - hey.
there you go. now, you can keep that.
Thanks. - here, i got you another pen.
nice meeting you. - take care.
calderon? calderon? - yeah?
a second?
since you apparently lost the pen race, would you, um, mind checking out a restaurant tip on our murder case, for the love of god?
thank you.
so why'd you lie, david? why did you say you hadn't seen her for months?
because i knew what you'd think.
that you're the one that beat claudia to death, right? you dumped her body.
that's exactly what we're thinking. - waitress said you made her feel real uncomfortable.
she didn't even want to come to your table.
so you want to tell us what you and claudia were fighting about so hard?
she came to my place that night, all right? out of the blue. we had sex.
and then she wanted to go eat at this place we always went to, and i thought... you know, i don't know what i thought.
and i said something dumb about us being back together, being happy.
and then she said it was all just to say go-bye
like, forever.
how did you feel about that?
how'd you feel about that- her leading you on like that?
bad.
I mean, i loved...
loved her.
I didn't want her to leave.
she wanted to leave you.
that's why you killed her, right?
you know, we found claudia's, uh, hair and fingerprints at your place. - because she was there.
you killed her there.
I didn't- - you killed her.
I didn't kill her!
I loved her, and the last thing she ever heard me say to her was that i hoped she'd never come back.
are you gonna arrest me, or can i go?
you just let him go- like, free?
Yeah. right out the door have a nice day, murderer.
come in.
sit down.
Thanks. - why'd you let the boyfriend go?
I thought he was looking good. - ay.
he's a dumb lug with fists like hams and no confession, no witnesses, no physical evidence, no scene.
Plus, i haven't closed the loop on the husband yet either.
so? what about the husband?
he cried. but he's creepy.
and no confession, no witnesses, no physical evidence, no scene, plus an alibi.
we arrest the wrong guy, we don't get a mulligan.
you have to be sure. - i know.
all right, who do you think it is?
I don't know. i
I mean... the husband?
even while he was crying, like...
some people want you to watch them grieve, you know?
so you could see him beating a woman to death with his hands by himself? - listen, i can see anyone doing anything if they get mad enough.
so, yeah, i could see him doing this, but right now it's just a feeling.
no, no, no. it's never just a feeling.
it's always coming out of experience or...
who knows?
it may not lead you right tohe killer every time, but it is never just a feeling.
I mean, if somebody...
was to put a gun to your head, who would you say it was?
the husband. - cheers.
with the investigation into who killed claudia ward seemingly at a standstill, police are under increased pressure to arrest a suspect.
so why are we going back to see the husband again?
cause i want to see his face when i tell him that we're arresting the boyfend.
only you're not arresting the boyfriend. you let him go.
I'm aware of that, augie. thank you.
Hey, is that detective rivera coming back anytime soon?
why do you care? - right. what do i care?
beautiful woman, doesn't have a chip on her shoulder, great smile, laughs at people's jokes.
you're right. it's awful. it's disgusting.
you know what else is awful? - huh? - steak...
porn.
stay here. - what? why?
cause you're bugging the crap out of me is why.
just so you know... - huh?
you have the worst personality of anyone i've ever met in my entire life.
detective timoney...
what can i do for you? - hello, there, mr. ward.
I hope you don't mind me dropping in on you like this.
of course not. no, please come in. - thank you.
I don't think i told you before, but you have a beautiful home.
Oh, thank you. probably gonna have to move soon.
there's too many memories. - sure, i get it.
Oh, no, thank you. i actually just wanted to stop by and let you know that, uh, we're close on david hollister.
that's great news.
Oh. at least i...
I think it's great news. i thought it would make me feel better.
did you know that he and claudia saw each other about a week before she died? did she tell you about that?
no.
because as far as you knew, it was over between them, right?
that's right.
is it unusual for a woman to be a homicide detective?
not for me. - huh. you have kids?
Nope. - why not?
busy, i guess. lucky.
may-maybe you haven't met the right guy yet.
who would that be, you think? - oh, i don't know. i don't know you.
no, you don't. i'm a real catch.
and i'll let you know when we make the arrest, okay?
so i looked into the past relationships of both these clowns.
all the boyfriend's exes say the same thing-great guy, romantic, charming.
probably a gentle lover, probably...
washes your hair.
what about malcolm? - couldn't find anything
no exes.
but you asked me to look into property.
he's paying rent on an apartment in queens...
for someone named susan whitney.
mistress? - maybe.
just texted you the address. - okay.
umreg? - yeah?
I really appreciate this.
what?
what the hell is that supposed to mean? are you being sarcastic or something?
I was being nice!
Malcolm ward pays rent on an apartment in queens.
let's go see what the hooker looks like.
this is a very nice... uh, place.
does malcolm pay the rent? - w-what?
sorry. does malcolm pay the rent here?
I don't see that that's any of your business.
but, yes. he's a wonderful son.
when i sold my house, he found me this place.
is that right? so your last name is whitney.
well, that was my second husband. he died of throat cancer.
does malcolm visit you often?
he comes to visit me every sunday. - that's very nice.
a man should visit his mother.
do you like cats, young man?
love.
well, this one's pregnant.
leave me your card, and you can have first pick.
that is so nice. - thank you.
so did you spend a lot of time with claudia and malcolm?
did they seem happy together?
Malcolm just came over, mostly by himself.
she was allergic to cats, but, yeah, he seemed happy enough
as happy as a man can be married to a whore.
excuse me?
she didn't appreciate anybody or anything.
Oh, i liked kasey much better.
kasey- who's kasey?
and then suddenly, poof, she's gone, and he and the whore are getting married.
and she wanted me to toast them at the rehearsal dinner.
wait. the-the whore is claudia.
I toasted, all right. i said, "here's to kasey,"
and how this should've been her.
ma'am, did kasey have a last name?
I'm sorry your tongue hurts, but you still have to clean your room.
Hey, there. kasey monrad?
I'm detective timoney. may i come in?
sure. - thank you.
I'm not sure what there is to know.
I saw on tv about his wife, but i haven't seen malcolm in years.
so why did you guys break up?
we just didn't have a lot in common. i mean...
I was only 16 when we met.
that's the same as claudia.
do you know how she died?
the news didn't say. - she was beaten to death.
okay.
does that surprise you?
why would it?
honey...
why would it surprise you that claudia got beaten to death?
are you that afraid of this guy still?
what's he gonna do to you now? he-he's not a super criminal or an unstoppable force of nature.
he's-he's an expensive suit with a bad haircut and a psycho mom that belongs in a horror movie.
he's a runt.
and he likes to beat up runaway girls with daddy issues.
you hear me?
how'd you get away?
I got pregnant, and i h-had an abortion.
no way was i gonna have his baby.
I don't blame you.
but after, ias bleeding, and i ended up needing him to take me to the emergency room, so he found out then.
he waited until i got better first, and then when i came home, he beat me so bad, i thought i was gonna die.
but then after, it's...
it was like i was dead to him.
so i didn't get away.
he let me go.
I'm not gonna testify. i hope you know that.
I hope you know you won't have to.
you know, i think i chipped a tooth on one of those old gargoyle's damn cookies.
pecan sandie, my ass- more like pecan razor blade.
I don't care. he did it. - did kasey just tell you that?
no, i mean, i know he did it now.
let's go back and look at that alibi-really look at it.
Hey, duffy, can you do me a favor, please?
Yes. go back and check susan whitney's properties now.
no, i still don't have a crime scene. thank you.
what- why aren't we driving? - i don't know where we're going.
the restaurant, the grey cat.
he signed in at 6: 32?
Yeah. he, uh, said he'd wait at the bar till his wife got here.
so he didn't start a tab till 6: 57?
you usually let people sit at your bar for 25 minutes without ordering?
cause i don't understand that business model.
he signed in at 6: 32. - okay, listen...
so all malcolm's really got is the text.
could he drive from here to the dumpster and back in 25 minutes is the question.
across town, soho rush hour?
hell, no. - i agree.
could he have run it?
smart.
so he's got claudia's phone. - uh-huh.
he talks to the hostess. he checks his coat with his phone in it.
right. - right.
and then he runs to the dumpster, and he calls himself from her phone.
right. - yes.
and he drops her phone in a sewer or whatever he does with it.
he runs back to the restaurant, goes into the bar to wait.
get it?
all that in 25 minutes? - yep.
I guess it's doable.
why don't we find out? here...
careful with the hat.
time me.
you ready? - yeah.
set...
go!
all right, this is gonna be interesting.
she runs like an oompa loompa.
it ain't happening.
what- - oh, my...
Oh, my god.
I don't even know what to say about that!
Oh, my god. wait. she's hurting.
you need me to call you an ambulance?
new plan!
you ready? - yeah.
and go!
jeez.
what is -a kenyan?
well, are kenyans seeded in the new york city marathon?
cause lou was. - new plan.
okay, average augie...
let's see something completely mediocre.
all right. lou, call it. - all right. ready?
go!
he looks pretty mediocre to me.
Malcolm's alibi is dead...
with a three-minute cushion to go back in the bar and order a commemorative bourbon old fashioned.
thank you very much. - can we do that?
Oh, my god.
you know how to get rid of those?
lemon wedge, angostura bitters, sugar
you hold it in your mouth. it shocks your system.
do that. no, do it. 'cause you're gonna keep on hiccuping until you puke.
it's really good. - do it.
how do you even know this works? - i grew up in a bar. i know everything.
timoney. - where are you guys?
M. e.'s office.
well, tell her to shake those cocktails a little quieter.
I can't hear you so good.
how's malcolm's alibi holding up?
it's not. it's him.
so he used to beat his ex-girlfriend, and he sent himself that text from claudia's phone.
what else? - nothing else. that's it.
well, not to armchair-quarterback you, but the d. a. is gonna want more.
I want more. - so get more.
evrard's got the phone records from the ward's house here
that's when you're done talking to the m. e. of course.
What'd he say? - he said we should finish our drinks.
can we get a check?
wake up. - ow. - there was a call from the university of michigan admissions department to the ward house lasting eight minutes the morning claudia died.
apparently claudia was enrolled for next semester.
you look like crap, by the way.
I haven't slept, and there were some drinks earlier.
so what do you think? do you think malcolm knew about the university of michigan?
he answered the phone.
the admissions officer said he kept asking if she was sure she had the right claudia ward.
she was getting aw. she was gonna leave him, right?
you still got my pen? - still got your wife?
I'm gonna look at the database, i swear.
actually, i was in the building, and i wanted to run something by you.
you got a sec? - uh-oh. - yeah, well...
three days before you dad's bar gets hit, there's a robbery in the east village, similar description
african-american, about 6', 170.
then the next night, another bar uptown gets hit- again, similar description.
then three hours before you dad's place gets hit, another bar in the village gets robbed- same description.
same type of gun? - same snub-nosed. 38.
uptown, then the village, and repeat like that. i think it's a pattern.
but not getting any support from my squad, though.
it sounds good to me. you should pursue. excuse me.
Susan whitney's got a storage unit.
stuff from her old house and what looks like a rack of claudia's clothes.
did you get a, uh- - yes, i got a warrant.
Yes, i executed it. yes, crime scene is with me.
Yes, you should come.
down there, detective.
ammonia much?
this guy tried to clean up. - yeah, he tried. didn't do a very good job, though.
I figure he steps aside, lets her go in first.
then he...
he hits her from behind. she goes down.
he's probably kicking her. she's crawling, trying to get away, but...
there's nowhere to go. but this...
so he's pounding her...
slamming her head on the floor.
she put up a fight.
at some point, he either picks her up, or she gets up, and he smashes her face into this.
what's his ex-girlfriend's name-kasey?
Yeah.
I hope she knows how lucky she is.
sometimes history doesn't exactly repeat itself, but
he's here. you ready?
Hey, maybe you ought to hit the head first.
Yeah, i could pee.
go get him. - kill it, skip.
did you pee?
Hey, there, malcolm. how you doing? - i'm-i'm fine. w- w-what's going on?
they said you have some new information. - yes. i'm happy to say that we do.
but would you mind talking down the hall?
it's very crowded in there tonight and not very private. - sure. fine.
right here.
would you care for some chocolate? it's good. - no, thanks. i'm-i'm fine.
come on, live a litt.
you're at your fighting weight. i can tell.
right here. come on in. have a seat.
what is this?
Oh, that's your wife, malcolm.
I just wanted to tell you that, uh, we found the crime scene.
you did? - yes.
your mother's storage unit.
well, i mean, claudia had keys to that unit.
she kept clothes there- spillover from her closet at home.
she was alwa saying how her closet was too small.
she went there all the time.
I- i don't know why she would take david there, though.
right. i also wanted to tell you we're no longer looking at david. he's been cleared.
well, do you have any other suspects? i mean, have you checked out the guys at the storage place?
Yeah. no.
Hey, did you know that your, uh, wife was going to grad school in-in michigan next semester?
Yes. of course i knew that. - you didn't think you should tell us?
I didn't see what it had to do with the-with the case.
Oh, i forgot. i forgot.
we talked to one of your ex-girlfriends
she told us how you used to beat her up pretty bad back in the day.
you remember her, don't you? - of course i do.
look, i'm not gonna go into a whole thing here, but kasey has a history of mental illness.
so forgive me, but consider the source.
God, you guys are really grasping at straws here, huh?
God, that poor girl. you-you show up at her house, and-and you start making her think that she knows something.
Claudia had a little more spunk than kasey is what i think.
kasey would've never had the guts to, uh, fool around on you, but david hollister
that was an act of full-on revolution.
he must've been amazing...
for her to risk getting caught.
although a guy like him after a guy like you, that must've been like a cold beer on a hot day.
you can't stop once you start.
all i know is that she came back, and i forgave her, okay? it hurt. it wasn't easy, but i forgave her.
you get a new one at the shelter?
did you pick one out already? claudia, kasey.
how old's this one-14, 15?
Oh, and i talked to your mother. did she tell you that?
Yes, she mentioned something about it.
Yeah, did she? good. what a lovely woman she is.
and she loves you.
she is in your corner all the way. and you know what?
when my mom was around, she was in my corner, too, just like your mom- swinging at anything that could hurt her little malcolm. but he's a big boy now.
I don't need her in my corner. - don't you?
I guess you don't. you don't need anyone to fight your battles for you, especially, uh, a woman, because you fight your battles against women, right?
you know what i've been wondering?
what if you guys had had a daughter instead of a son?
what would've happened then?
I mean, how would've you felt about that?
would you have ended up beating your little girl, too?
what are you talking about? - the baby.
you knew claudia was pregnant.
no?
so...
Claudia finds out she's pregnant, and she wants to have it- not like kasey.
so she plans for herself and the baby to get away from you, but you find out, and you know what you do?
you beat her to death, and you throw her body in a dumpster near david hollister's place, so it looks like he did it.
12 weeks old, definitely yours!
you can't really tell from the picture, but the m. e. said that it's definitely a boy.
you killed your son, malcolm!
don't you tell me what i did! - hey! sit down!
sit down!
bitch!
whose sonogram was that?
an admin aide upstairs in warrants.
she was actually four months along with a girl, but she was happy to do it when i told her why.
hail mary, but it worked.
good thinking. - thank you.
you're welcome.
for the love of god. - whoops.
I'm not gonna bug you with any more questions.
all right?
me and Detective Duffy, we just want to make sure you know that you're safe now.
and if there's anything you want to tell us, anything at all, we want to hear it. No matter what it is.
okay?
it's okay. You're okay.
Amanda, this is Sarah. Sarah's a doctor.
she's talked to a lot of kids who have...
she's talked to a lot of kids.
I'm gonna sit here with you while these guys go right outside for a minute, okay?
Thanks, doc.
you can make it as loud as you want.
nothing to housekeeping who found her, nothing to the E. M.T. s who checked her over, nothing to me, nothing to you.
maybe she'll talk to the doc.
I don't know.
she was where, downstairs?
Where's that claw game she was playing?
the lobby, left of the elevators.
desk guy said he gave her quarters for dollars.
far as we know, she played the game, couldn't grab any of the cheap, crappy toys with the claw, and ran out of money.
she came back up here and found them.
so... father stabbed in the chest.
mother's throat cut, what else we got?
family checked in this morning.
visiting from Pellum Lake up near Albany.
now they said something about taking the kid to the Broadway show.
crime scene says we're looking at a big knife.
maybe 15 inches.
that's it?
you want to give us a second?
all you had to do was talk to some kid who wasn't talking back to you.
Where's the luggage, they not have any?
it's in the bathtub.
I think they read that article where that's how to avoid getting bedbugs.
if you want to avoid getting bedbugs, I wouldn't sit on that chair.
credit cards, I. D. but no cash.
still doesn't smell like a robbery to me.
well, maybe it started as a push in, you know.
and then uh, one of them mouths off, robber gets angry, and starts stabbing everybody.
Hey, Reg, Jane, come on.
every camera crew in the city is in the lobby right now.
so we need to be thinking about getting her out of here before those ghouls find out that there is a her.
that's all we need.
guy who killed her parents who thinks he got away with it seeing her on tv or in the paper.
what about the service elevator?
Nope, service elevator and the stairs lead down to the back of the lobby.
that's where you're saying the camera crews are, so even with a blanket over her head, they're still gonna know she's a kid.
so, ideas?
wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
one at a time!
one at a ti... again sir, as I said, we're not going to be making a detailed statement.
but uh, rest assured, we're going to be talking to anyone that has any direct information about the crimes that were committed at this hotel.
okay?
so thank you very much and as soon as I have something more to give you, I will.
thank you.
all right, fellas, time to play maybe.
Oh, I'm a son of a bitch at maybe.
Oh, yeah? - Yep.
then maybe Louis and I should go grab a beer while you solve this case then.
go right ahead.
why'd the killer use a knife and not a gun?
cause he's Puerto Rican. - Watch it.
or maybe because a knife is quiet.
so this is a careful guy? - Careful guys wear gloves.
careful glove guy gonna come in here, knifes these two, goes down in an elevator?
not likely.
maybe it's crowded.
so maybe he takes the stairs.
which leads out to a lobby.
careful glove guy's not strolling through the lobby with no blood gloves on, Augie.
okay, he takes the gloves off. - He maybe takes them off.
Yeah, but not in here because we didn't find any gloves.
right.
takes them off in the stairwell.
with his bare hand and maybe leaves a print.
maybe.
they call it single-blow trauma.
like a car accident or a hurricane.
or experience it in whatever way she did.
walking in to find them.
so this single-blow trauma gives a timeline for when she's gonna talk again?
so that's it?
you can't do nothing for the poor kid?
I just got off the horn with Amanda's aunt, the mom's sister.
yeah?
let's talk about if uh, the kid's okay to travel.
it'd be good to get Amanda back somewhere she feels safe.
when can the aunt get down here?
she can't. You're gonna drive her back up to what's it, uh... What's it, uh...
Pellum Lake. - Yeah.
that's nice. - I'm doing it?
Yeah, yeah, you and Jane.
sidebar.
I need to sidebar on this topic.
denied. Remember to gas up the car.
uh, excuse us.
if this is about, um, you needing a woman, then maybe you should take Shorr.
because she's very good with the little people.
that's a good idea, Shorr can do it.
she's always yammering on about going up to the beach.
you two were her first points of contact.
if she's gonna feel comfortable with any of us, it's gonna be you.
so go voucher for food and incidentals and get on the road already. All right?
excuse us.
this is a double-homicide...
thank you. - Yeah, thanks.
which is why when you get Amanda home, you're gonna do the victimology, the personal history, the background, the associates, y...
Pellum Lake local cops can do that.
I want to work this end.
get on the road.
you know how to use this thing?
no?
here's the volume, okay.
here's the playlist.
my friend Evrard, I'm so sorry, but he loves Merengue.
there's other songs on there too.
but seriously, Merengue's not so bad.
so... okay.
you're not even gonna bring a change of clothes?
not gonna be there long enough to need it.
really, you just pretty much guaranteed that a car part's gonna break and they'll have to order one from the next county over and we'll be there for a week...
since when do you smoke?
when I drive. - No you don't.
I've been in the car with you a bunch of times, and you do not do that.
on car trips longer than three hours, you better believe it.
you think you're driving?
Yeah, know why I think it? - Why?
putting your blinker on once as you switch lanes is not signaling.
that guy needed to be made an example of.
you shouldn't get to make an example of anyone.
you drive with your right foot on the gas and your left foot on the brake.
why would they have egg salad?
a burger joint with egg salad is weird.
that's gross.
should have taken an antacid first.
thank you for the food we eat.
thank you for the world so sweet.
thank you for the birds that sing.
thank you, God, for everything.
she uh, didn't say anything until then.
till she said grace.
that seems like a good sign, huh?
even though she hasn't said anything since?
well, guess the hotel wasn't very nice, was it?
looked okay on the website.
Amanda was really excited.
she was hoping there'd be a pool.
so do you know uh, what your sister and her husband were doing in New York, exactly?
the took Amanda to see Wicked on Broadway.
what was I gonna say?
what did you want to say?
they didn't have the money.
I mean, Rick hasn't worked in 18 months and Molly's the cashier at a pharmacy.
did you notice anything different about them lately maybe?
no, they're just regular people. - Hmm.
why would you ask that?
they've just been robbed at a hotel.
why would you ask if they've been asking...
we have to look at everything.
can't rule it out unless we've looked into things.
no, we really need your permission to go through Molly and Rick's stuff if you don't mind.
I'll get the key.
thank you.
better call the local constabulary.
let them know that city folk with guns are poking around.
we've got to go out for a little bit.
you want me to get you anything from your house?
okay.
well, we'll come by on our way out and uh, say goodbye.
right?
Yeah, I was wondering that myself.
I served them with foreclosure papers a couple of weeks ago.
Ooh, and how'd they react?
well, they were embarrassed mostly, I'd say.
you a hunter, detective?
I've murdered plenty of fish.
meat, I buy.
how much is this worth?
3, 400.
Hey, Reg?
looks like someone broke in here.
and took what, exactly?
ring, phone, come on, call me back.
come on, ring, dummy. - Ring, ring, ring.
as you might have guessed, gentlemen, I got a whole mess of latent prints off the stairwell doorknob up at the girl's hotel.
worth a shot.
Oh indeed, 'cause there's only one print that's got a little blood smeared on it.
we're looking to match it.
what you guys doing?
the girl's dad's cell phone log had seven missed calls from the same number yesterday.
no messages, local number.
so I call it, right?
and a guy picks up and he says, "Do you have the stuff?"
to which I reply, "Yeah. Oh, I got the stuff."
whatever the stuff is.
to which he says, "All right, I'm gonna call you back and tell you where to meet me," but he hasn't called yet.
that's 'cause you spooked him.
see you should have let me do the talking.
okay?
you should have let me do the talking.
okay, 'cause we know that I'm the only authentic one.
excuse me? The only authentic what?
the only authentic detective?
come on, come on.
listen, I pick up the phone I sound like the guy that's got the stuff.
okay, no matter what the stuff is, I sound like that guy.
compared to you.
first of all, we don't even have the stuff.
all right, what we have is a phone.
and our victim is from cow country, not the Bronx.
so he's supposed to sound white?
um, you are white. - Oh...
I'm Puerto Rican. - Guys, shush!
Hello?
Oh yeah, I got it right here with me.
Yeah, oh I know where that is.
Yeah, okay.
I'll see you there.
Oh, I'll see you there. - See, that's what I mean.
I told you. - I'm the authentic one.
I'm the only one... You owe me an apology.
told you.
1899/12/31 0: 03: 00
it's pretty quiet out here in the sticks.
I can hear my thoughts. That's not my favorite thing.
the woods are full of raccoons.
they got little hands, I don't like that.
so what about this dead couple, huh?
they're broke, but they go on this trip.
they're killed in their hotel room.
but the perp leaves the credit cards there.
and their house is broken into, but all this valuable stuff is still sitting around.
well, we'll pull the bank records and phone logs tomorrow and maybe...
hold on.
timoney.
the real reason that Rick and Molly Patterson took this trip is 'cause they got a suitcase full of pain pills that they were trying to sell.
oxycodone.
huh, but it wasn't in the hotel room.
right, but they never hooked up with the guy they were trying to sell it to.
and where'd they get it?
sounds like they brought it with them.
you guys tell us.
all righty.
get this.
the Pattersons had a suitcase filled with pills they were gonna sell.
oxy.
the guy they were gonna sell them to, they never hooked up with, and we don't have a suitcase.
didn't the aunt say that Molly was the cashier at the pharmacy?
can't be that easy, can it?
you get a ride with the sheriff.
I need the car.
what?
why, what for?
because before I try to talk to Amanda about how her parents were drug dealers, I need to go get you and I a couple of motel rooms because obviously we're gonna be sticking around for a while.
don't you wish you had packed a bag now?
come on.
thank you.
what are you, a giraffe?
Hey, I have that seat right how I like it.
if you move it, you better know how to move it back.
I'm serious.
you better know how to move it back.
man, short people.
they don't need to be next to each other, all right?
they don't even need to be clean.
they just need to be not the same room.
okay, well, one of them has two twins instead of a king size.
and the other one doesn't have a fridge.
okay, I don't really care. Can I just pay you, please?
here you go. Okay.
check out time... noon.
pool closes at 11: 00 P. M.
pool, you say?
around back.
I know someone who will like that.
I always wanted to go swimming when I was a kid.
my dad used to take me to this place, Jones Beach, in the summer sometimes.
and one year, there were these jellyfish everywhere.
they were like those see-through kind.
you'd get out of the water and they'd be draped all over you, and sting you and it was really gross.
you know how to hold your breath?
competition?
I'm really good at it.
on the count of three, ready?
one.
yeah?
one, two...
three.
you won. Guess I'm not that...
why did that happen?
to my mom and dad?
why was it them?
I don't know.
I saw him.
he left the room door open.
the man.
when he came out after...
I didn't want him to see me.
and then he went down the stairs.
and then I went in.
it's okay, buddy.
you're all right.
can she describe him?
she's pretty vague.
how vague?
"a guy walked out of the room" vague.
that is not a lot.
well, she literally just started talking again.
so I'm trying not to jinx it.
what about you guys?
well we got a partial print.
trying to match it, but right now that's all we got.
we got nothing. It's cold here.
Siberia.
well, we all better try to do better.
because I'm not telling this kid that we choked it.
okay? - All right.
Bye.
I don't know.
I have no clue how she got those pills.
uh, I barely even talked to h...
Andy, come on. You know something.
now you gotta talk to this guy.
so this dead woman, your employee, gets her hands on a grunt load of oxy and you have no idea how that could have happened.
Andy. - What?
look, stop trying to make this guy think you're a hardass, all right?
this is how it sits, okay?
either you and the Pattersons were dealing oxy together and you're wetting yourself 'cause you're about to be in big trouble.
or, Molly Patterson stole the oxy from you.
and then I have to wonder why you didn't call the cops.
I couldn't.
I couldn't report the pills stolen because I...
I'm not supposed to have them.
and there it is.
please continue.
I'm only allowed a certain amount of oxycodone a month.
but I got people in pain.
what am I supposed to tell them?
"too bad, suffer"?
so you bought a suitcase full of pills from someone. Who?
well they bring them down from Canada.
the uh, off the books.
I- I-I dropped the money off, I- I picked up the pills,
I didn't see anybody. I didn't kill anybody.
who brought them down from Canada?
"Mark"? You know the guy?
Yeah, he's on my radar.
I'm not surprised he's the one.
I'm surprised you didn't think this was worth your while telling me till just now. Or am I?
am I surprised? No, never mind.
let's go.
you ever actually arrest anyone up here, or are you mostly writing parking tickets?
I'm sorry, that's not fair.
you also do foreclosures.
listen, Slick... - Yes, Gilligan?
it's only me, my deputy, and three part-timers.
takes the Staties almost an hour to get here, if they feel like it.
I do my best to lock down this town, okay?
and when I have to pull strings to expedite phone records for some obnoxious out-of-towner's case, I do my best at that too.
thank you, sheriff.
now, are you two going to be able to work on the drug-running suspect together while I check out these phone records and wait for Amanda's Aunt Peggy to come, or no?
tell me now.
thank you for the entertainment.
doesn't leave me a ton of options.
how you doing?
Mr. Morgan, right?
detective Duffy, N. Y.P. D.
this is Sheriff Lawson. I'm sure you've met.
uh, we just wanted to talk about a few...
Nope.
you don't wanna know what about?
because two people were murdered.
Rick and Molly Patterson.
this is a small town. I know you probably know them.
do you?
they were killed down in New York City with a big, huge knife.
and something about a lot of oxycodone.
now I know you know about that.
you need to get out of here, okay?
you and him, get back in your car, - and get off my land. - Wait.
we seem to have started off on the wrong foot here.
let's try again.
how you doing?
this is not a knife.
this is a Glock 19.
and this... is a camera.
say "cheese."
I'm gonna show you a picture right now, all right?
I don't want you to think about anything except if it looks familiar, all right?
okay, here.
no?
are you sure?
okay.
thanks for your time.
so should we stop him? What if he's taking off?
Amanda says it's not him.
so we're not gonna do anything?
he's your drug trafficker, not our murderer.
so if something needs to be done, it needs to be done by you.
hold on.
be right back.
I picked Amanda up some ice cream.
it's got bubble gum in it.
that's the kind my kids used to like.
very nice of you.
aunt Peggy not here yet?
no, she's still at work, and she needs to pick her kids up on the way here.
and Amanda's absolutely sure Mark Morgan wasn't the guy?
Sh-She's never seen him before.
and I-I was watching her... Her face, her eyes, nothing.
call logs give you anything?
Yeah, a headache.
otherwise, no. - Man.
that partial better turn out to be something.
if that kid eats ice cream after all the chips and candy I crammed in her today,
I'm gonna take her to Coney Island and enter her in a hot dog eating con...
quick
what the hell's going on?
she's been hit!
Oh, God, buddy.
how bad? - Bad!
sheriff, hit the lights!
you okay?
he's got us pinned in. Call 911!
Duffy, my gun! It's in the top drawer.
you're all right.
we're moving you.
stay awake for me. Sally!
there's a situation at the Starbright.
what's your favorite subject? - Math.
I gotta get all the guys and I gotta get the Staties here. We're getting shot at!
no, I'm not kidding!
get over here, sheriff.
let me see if we can get out the back.
Oh, God.
Duffy, grab me a towel, it's bleeding through.
here.
hold this. We're going out the back window.
what? It's too small. - Well, not for me, it's not.
and we're not moving her until it's safe.
then what? What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna flank him to get his attention off this damn room!
sheriff, get over here! Get down.
all right, Amanda. Hold on there.
I get there, I yell, you cover me. Got it?
I got it. Hey.
don't be stupid. - Whatever.
there you go, breathe.
you okay?
fine. How's she?
bullet wound to the side, I need all hands on deck.
everybody with the day off has gotta come in, Lisa, do you hear me?
heavenly dove with light and comfort from above.
what are you saying?
Oh, nothing.
it's something that dad used to say to me when I was a little girl.
it's okay. Gracious spirit, heavenly dove with light and comfort from above.
be our guardian, you our guide.
stay close by this sweet child's side.
we got you. - It's all right, buddy.
go.
keep your eyes open. It's gonna be all right.
you hear me? It's gonna be all right.
me too.
it's the adrenaline.
here, sit.
whiskey, bourbon, whatever you got around here you're not supposed to.
so the shooter you nailed...
there's no way he's our doer?
Amanda said no, and we believe her.
you're sure? Yeah.
and Morgan had an alibi.
and the pharmacist, Whittaker, does too, so...
why was Morgan trying to kill our girl then?
Morgan's muling oxy from Canada, supplying it to the pharmacist who sells it all over town.
so if it's not them, there must be a third guy, an accomplice.
the one that Amanda saw, the one that doesn't want her talking, so...
hold on. - What?
uh, just, uh, everyone I've got is on their way.
we got the State Troopers en route too.
uh, look, I-I was thinking that, uh, maybe we could go tear apart Morgan's place.
maybe we could find something that would help us... Would help you.
Yeah. This.
Hey. So where are you guys?
we're waiting on a match for the, uh, bloody partial print.
they're gonna tell us in the morning.
Oh, yeah? I'll tell them something different.
get me the name and number of who you talked to.
Jane, are you at the hospital now? Uh, yeah.
Amanda's in surgery, her aunt was terrified, and she wouldn't leave her other kids.
and you heard Duffy went to toss Morgan's place.
no one else is here, so...
I wanna be here, I guess.
are you okay? I'm good.
I hate it up here. Did I tell you that?
how is she? Uh, don't know yet.
state Troopers are on the way.
Yeah, Lawson told us already. Thanks.
what the hell are you doing with that thing anyway?
sheriff's orders.
you know what? If you don't mind me saying...
your boss is kind of the king of too little too late.
Hey, how is she?
through and through, it looks like.
don't think it even nicked anything on the way, but we're gonna take her down to X-Rays, make sure we're not missing anything.
she gave you a real good scare. Yeah.
Hey, buddy. We'll go with you, okay?
radiation's in the basement of the South wing.
hope you got your hiking boots on.
how you doing there, Roy?
good, Nance.
Yeah. - Yeah, we got a match on your bloody print off the hotel door knob.
only it's not off a criminal record...
a hit came back.
Otreego County employee database.
ready for this?
deputy Roy Green.
come on, Jane. Come on.
what? What is it? - Shut up, shut up!
spooky, huh?
Yeah, there used to be 90, 000 people in the tri-county area.
now there's, what? 40?
since the financial cutbacks, this place has been slowly falling apart.
hello there, you've reached Jane Timoney leave a message, please...
pick up, Jane! Pick up, pick up!
son of a bitch.
how you doing there, buddy? - Good.
soon as we get out of here, I'm gonna get you such a big Shirley Temple with those huge Maraschino cherries.
you like them? I don't like them much.
taste like chemicals and stuff.
know what I mean?
just down in the basement.
all aboard.
what are you doing?
he's the guy who killed Amanda's parents.
what... Roy is?
Yes, listen to me, Nancy.
no, listen to me. I'm clocking out of here, all right, in half an hour, and my family... look, I got nothing to do with this.
whatever this is, I got nothing to do with it.
I understand, Nancy. Calm down, okay?
just stay right here.
hold on, okay? W- w-wait.
okay, can you pick her up?
cause I can't shoot and pick her up at the same time.
please.
it's going to be all right.
Nancy knows the way out, don't you?
keep... just...
put your arms around here.
okay, I've got you.
okay, which way?
this way. - This way?
hold on. - Okay.
that's it, that's it, that's it.
Oh, help me, God, oh, my God.
okay, it's okay.
okay, let's go.
this way.
where? - Right down here.
right here, right here.
okay.
right here, right here.
okay.
my God.
it's okay. - Shh.
it's okay.
okay. Is there another exit?
there's an emergency exit down the hall.
Yeah, let's go.
come on.
let's go.
he's here.
let's go.
hurry.
they kept saying they were going to put a lock on the door to keep kids from coming up here to get drunk.
so where is there... - Okay!
so where is there another way out?
back to where we came from.
you're kidding me.
look, I didn't make this place, all right?
we want out, we gotta go back.
okay, ready? Go.
Yes, you can, come on.
no, I can't.
Yes, you can! Keep going.
I wasn't even scheduled to work today, you know that?
I'm just covering for that bitch Lisa.
know how to use this?
I'm from Newark.
good girl.
shoot at anything that moves, all right?
except for me and her.
come on, buddy.
come on.
all right.
give me your phone.
give me your phone. Go ahead.
stay!
Hey, listen, some people come back, and I'm one of them. Okay?
okay.
don't shoot.
it's over. Okay, it's over.
I really need to start exercising.
okay, okay.
all right.
okay, buddy. All right.
let's go get that X-Ray.
okay.
your deputy. It was all his operation.
me and Mark just worked for him.
Yeah, all I did was be their front.
Roy said if I didn't help, then he'd report me to the D. E.A.
for doing it anyway, and that I'd go to jail.
I could listen to this all day.
how about you, Duff?
naive, small town, "What, wait, who, me?"
I love it.
get him out of here.
listen, uh...
I'm really sorry about all of this.
sorry, huh?
you've any idea the paperwork we're in for?
not to mention the firearms discharge review.
don't forget the Grand Jury inquiry.
and the psych eval.
those are fun, Reg.
Yeah, so...
sorry's not cutting it, sheriff.
all right, well...
any time you two want to leave is fine with me.
are you leaving?
are you trying to get rid of me?
hmm, not this second.
but soon.
you know what, you were an awfully brave girl last night.
and that's a good thing, 'cause you're going to have to keep doing that, okay?
guess what? - What?
I didn't tell you this before, but um, my mom died too, when I was just a little older than you.
and gosh, I was mad.
and I missed her, and then, some days I completely forgot about her, and that really made me feel awful.
and when I felt awful, I felt mad again.
so...
there's no right way to feel about something this terrible happening.
okay?
the right way is however you feel.
you know, like now, I feel sad.
I feel a little sad.
cause I don't like many people.
especially little people.
but I like you.
I like you a lot.
I like you too.
I don't know why.
you know what?
I am not going to get up here very often, even though it's been so much fun, and there's so much to do...
but here's my card.
see, there's my phone number?
see that there?
Mm-hmm. - Yeah.
you call me any time.
I'll always answer. Okay?
okay.
okay.
can I call you tonight?
I wish you would.
see you, buddy.
how you doing, sweetie?
my first foot post was in East Harlem.
I got 20 something years on the job, shot people, but I never killed no one.
I leave the city for one day, two bodies.
Yeah, and if we don't leave here right now, there's going to be a lot more.
I'll tell you that.
I'll shoot every leaf-crapping tree in this place if I could.
let's get the hell home, right?
I'm gonna drive so fast, the transmission's gonna explode, which will not make me stop.
Nope, don't stop.
don't even slow down when we reach my apartment.
I'll just roll out.
I'll be fine.
better than here.
I like your shirt, by the way.
Yeah. Souvenir.
we're gonna see your daddy soon.
aren't we, Jake?
he's been on a big aeroplane up in the sky...
but he'll be landing...God! Any minute!
come on!
road works again.
what's going on, Jake?
we have to tell Cutter.
but Caroline hated Rex.
that's why she took him, Connor.
and to get back at you for dumping her by text.
why isn't she giving him back?
maybe she's still crazy about me.
and she gonna hold him hostage until I get back together with her.
Really?
maybe not.
don't tell Cutter yet, OK?
I'll get him back, I promise.
Hey.
so what's this secret meeting all about?
I don't know - it's a secret, ain't it?
do you wanna put that down?
he's told us to meet him here.
I wanted it to be somewhere we wouldn't be overheard.
Wow! Advanced paranoia or what?
a necessary precaution.
come here.
now, someone is working against us.
someone who has access to the Detector and probably the same person who stole the headset in the Silurian.
someone?
OK, I know that we all have our own ideas about who that might be but this time, we have to find out for sure.
OK, so how are we gonna do that?
mummy!
mummy!
mummy!
mum!
mummy!
it's OK, Jake.
Hey, are you OK?
I can't get out.
my legs are trapped. My little boy
what's his name?
Hi, Jake.
I'm Ed.
OK, hang in there, little guy.
the cavalry's on the way.
I've got a crowbar in my car.
I'll be right back. OK?
it's OK, Jake. The nice man's gonna get us out of here.
my worst nightmare in one sentence.
a mammoth on the M25!
a Colombian mammoth. The flavour is immaterial.
colombian is a hairless species, sir.
look, I don't care if it shaved its legs and got a bikini wax.
it's on a motorway in broad daylight.
it's not gonna be enough.
no. We're gonna need a bigger gun.
what are you doing here?
I needed to see you.
get down!
I...left the gun inside. I'll catch you up, yeah?
what are you playing at?
talk to me, Stephen.
you were right.
cutter knows about the conspiracy.
you come with me. We can't wait any longer.
Nick can cope.
every second you delay makes Lester's position stronger.
all right.
we're here. OK. Don't worry now.
Hi. I've shut down the motorway at the next two junctions, shut down the mobile networks and there's a no-fly zone in place and the eyewitnesses have been debriefed.
and all that with your skirt tucked into your tights. Well done
I'm not gonna look. Mammoth, go.
Oh, you beauty.
it's the biggest elephant that ever lived.
they were still running around North America until about 8, 000 years ago.
he's a herd animal.
can't smell its mates.
please help me! Please!
we've got to get her out.
no, if we go near her, it will make things worse.
the mammoth's panicking because she's making too much noise.
the first thing we've got to do is get her to shut up.
get Jenny to put you through to the Highways Agency.
tell them we've got to get an urgent message.
I'm on it.
no, we're gonna need more fire power.
Oh, jeez, where the hell is Stephen?
we'll need proof.
files, photographs, video footage.
a complete record of the entire anomaly operation.
you know Lester will kill you if he has to.
you'll have to tell the press everything.
could get ugly. That's not all.
we have to give Cutter another chance.
what? - We're gonna tell him what we're doing
give him the choice.
you can't tell him, Stephen.
I'm not going to.
you are.
all right.
if you think Nick'll listen to reason, you're wrong.
Oh, he'll listen. It's not personal.
come on.
shut Up!
tactful
it's what you said, innit?
I can't wait any longer.
what are you gonna do?
this.
come on.
right, can you move?
I'm trapped. Please help Jake.
don't worry.
mum - It's OK. I'll look after her.
take him.
mum!
it's OK, Jake.
take him.
Connor, help Abby!
come on, Jake.
what's going on?
we have to get the mammoth back through the anomaly.
I have an idea.
look after him, Connor. I won't be long.
what about Dumbo?
distract it.
distract it?
distract it.
any ideas? - Na-uh!
me neither.
car, car, car, car...
Yes!
darling, I've got to get this steering column off your legs.
Now...look at me.
this is gonna hurt a little.
but please try and be quiet.
listen to me. Try and keep your legs straight.
don't look! Don't look!
come on. We're getting in.
keys. Gotta find some keys.
keep pressing it. It's working. Keep pressing it, mate.
it's out!
...25 is still blocked in
come on. Out you get.
come on.
stand up. OK.
head down. You'll be OK.
and Jake? - He's safe.
what about you?
I'll be fine.
what's this?
female elephant urine.
it's gonna wanna follow the scent.
from the safari park, one junction down.
Yes. Brilliant.
come on now.
sniff this!
the anomaly!
Connor's in that truck.
Connor, pull up the ramp!
which button's the ramp, mate?
press 'em all!
pull up the ramp!
press every button you can see.
we caught a mammoth.
I think we did it, mate.
high five.
I've never seen an elephant like that.
it was a monster.
and there was that strange light.
what do you think it is exactly?
Hey!
who are you? -Mick Harper, "Evening News."
what's going on?
Dina, we have to talk about what happened.
talk about what exactly?
you'll need to go to hospital.
I've seen the pictures. That thing is too big to be an elephant.
do you know what? You're right. It's actually a mammoth.
I could do without the wind-up.
then stop asking stupid questions.
there's something strange going on down here.
and, one way or the other, I'm gonna find out what it is.
come on, Jake. Let's find your mum, eh?
so where the hell have you been?
we could have been killed. - You weren't.
not this time.
are you just gonna ignore me, Nick?
is she with you?
not in the way you think.
you've been seeing her.
Yeah, a couple of times but, look...
this is important.
you're fired.
she can help us.
if you think Helen's here to help, then you're madder than she is.
just listen to me!
are you still in love with her?
is that why you trust her?
do you know what? I don't care. Do what you want.
I tried to warn you.
don't get attached. You can't keep him.
did you know their trunk was five times more dextrous than an elephant's?
why is everyone telling me facts about mammoths today?
do I look interested?
still, those tusks might be worth a bit.
you wouldn't!
Eurgh! Have a word with him about personal hygiene, would you?
be careful, Lester.
he'll attack predators if he senses danger.
Hey!
that's not something you see every day.
pity you missed him in action.
I'm sorry about that.
what about you, Abby? Do you think what we're doing here is right.
keeping all this a secret?
Yeah.
I do.
look at the way we treat animals now, Stephen.
every day, a new species disappears.
what would people do to creatures they don't understand?
this isn't just about the creatures. This is about our future.
bottom line...
whatever Cutter decides...
.I'm with him.
we don't have the right to decide what people should know.
whatever argument you may have had, you lost any credibility when you hooked up with her.
she predicted this.
said that you wouldn't listen.
that you were too arrogant to face reality.
reality? You have no idea what that word even means any more.
the world changed.
it's always your way or nothing.
that works for me.
no wonder she turned to me.
that's made everything simple.
Connor, come with me.
is anybody looking?
nobody knows what we're doing, Connor.
they've got no reason to be suspicious.
so relax
and stop feeling so guilty.
sorry.
Ooh, my hands are shaking.
this thing with Stephen - Don't go there.
I just thought it was a bit harsh.
I mean, he's still our friend, ain't he?
and he's nothing to do with me.
at least I can tell Abby I tried.
it's done. Both parts.
no-one's gonna know about this until it turns round and bites 'em.
OK.
let's see where this trial leads.
he actually hit you.
and you find that funny?
Yeah. Don't you?
after everything I said about not caring any more, my husband is actually jealous.
and that's what's important to you?
no.
no, Nick doesn't matter now.
you and I matter.
our project.
Yeah. - What we are going to achieve together.
he shouldn't have hurt you.
my poor Stephen.
I'll sign for that.
you never can be too careful.
I thought a dramatic setting might be appropriate.
why, were you hoping for divine intervention?
you'd better pray Caroline doesn't hurt Rex.
Why...does Caroline know about Rex?
the thing is, me and Caroline - They broke up.
she's stolen him.
what?
what kind of girl steals your lizard when you split up?
she doesn't actually know how...unusual he is.
well, what if she gives him to somebody who does?
you're right.
Yeah. So get him back.
OK.
should be any minute now.
can someone tell me why we're here?
Connor reset the anomaly Detector.
a false alarm went off exactly 15 minutes ago.
there hasn't been an alarm.
that's because it was diverted first to the person who's been sabotaging the Detector.
they'll be coming here, right now, expecting an anomaly.
the next person through the door's our traitor.
sorry I'm late.
I had a few loose ends to tie up.
I know what a difficult job it is to pretend to enjoy someone's company.
so er...well...
.I hope this makes up for it.
Connor's not going to get hurt, is he?
you mean you actually care?
I'm not...
I'm human.
yes you are.
I hear you've got a present for me.
excellent.
Undistinguished, but he can serve his purpose.
what purpose is that?
why are you so interested in these...these things?
look, if you really want to know, I can show you.
your choice.
it's Jenny.
so where is it, then?
you! - Where's the anomaly?
there isn't one.
then why are we here?
that's a good question.
I give you 10 seconds to answer it.
I knew you were odd, but this is extreme, even by your standards.
the alarm was false.
the only way that you could've known is if you created a diversion between the Detector and your own computer.
now, who are you working for?
I must ask you to lower your weapon!
now, what do you want?
I don't know what you're on about.
all I know is I was told to bring as many men as possible to this address to deal with an anomaly.
who told you that?
I'm not very good at talking with a gun in my face so put it down and we'll discuss this!
I said: Who sent you!
this is your last chance.
you're gonna get us both killed.
sir, lower your weapon!
lower your weapon at once!
last chance.
it was Leek who sent me.
we've got to get back to the Arc.
Hello?
anybody there?
you are on your own, James.
there's no-one there but you.
leek, what the hell are you doing?
now, I want you to feel what it's like to be on the wrong end of your grand disdain.
the little man looking up at the big boss.
security!
I want security in here now!
they've all gone, James.
either off on Cutter's wild goose chase, or dead.
now...
.I'm going to hunt you.
you're never gonna make me beg for my life, so let's just end it now.
all right, if you insist.
goodbye, James.
one more thing.
yes?
you really are a tiresome little man.
come on.
good boy.
good mammoth.
why would Leek go to so much trouble to try and kill me?
I think that's the icing on the cake.
there's something bigger than just you going on here.
I see, First I'm a traitor, now I'm insignificant.
you're gonna hurt my feelings.
if Leek wanted to kill you, he could've pushed you down a lift shaft but he didn't.
he studied the anomalies. He worked out how to control the future predator.
doesn't sound like just a petty grudge.
so what does he want?
I don't know.
my kids are really pestering me for a pet.
if you can't find a home for it...
you're still cross with me, aren't you?
you held a gun to my head.
I set a trap
and you walked into it. I mean, what was I supposed to think?
you could've trusted me.
I had overwhelming evidence that you were a traitor.
your evidence was wrong.
I really don't know what you're complaining about.
nobody got hurt. The plan worked.
in a roundabout kind of way.
what are you doing?
trying to track down Leek. There's got to be a clue in his personal files.
obviously know your way around.
hack into him regularly, do you?
Oh, yeah.
you'd be amazed how much Lester gets paid.
what's my middle name?
you told me that once though, right?
no.
keep out of my personal information, Connor.
Oh, look.
got it!
password?
no.
predator.
mother's maiden name?
they always use that.
anomaly.
it's way too obvious.
well, just try it.
Oh, look. We're in.
it's a bomb.
everybody get out now.
get OUT!
not you.
leek knew we'd come after him, so he's booby trapped the file.
why are we still here?
because, if this bomb goes off, we lose the Arc and everything in it
the Detector, our research...everything.
we've got to stop it.
OK.
we can do this.
we can do this.
pliers.
which wire?
which wire do I cut?
red one.
always the red one.
count it down.
what?
count slower.
7...Please don't leave me here.
he was using the battery as a power source.
if there's no battery in, there's no bomb.
never a dull moment.
you did what?
a bomb?
of all the crass, misconceived ideas, Oliver...
do you want me to finish this now?
because I can walk away at any time and, without me, you're nothing.
do you understand?
you realise this is going to make Nick more determined to find you.
what is it?
my guess is that it's some kind of neural clamp.
it was surgically implanted in the skull of the predator.
it must be how Leek was controlling it.
the clamp is linked to the central nervous system and it's operated by remote radio signals.
I've never seen anything this advanced.
leek isn't this smart.
you mean he hotwired his brain by remote control.
which is where he's made a mistake.
any incoming radio signals are picked up by the Detector, right?
Yeah.
mso all we have to do is track where this signal is transmitted from
.and that's where we'll find Leek.
I'm on it.
should we call Stephen?
Stephen's made his bed. Let him lie in it now.
you make a crude little joke like that again you'll regret it.
who was that?
a journalist.
someone from the old days. I've arranged a meeting.
I'll come with you.
not this time. He's an old friend. I'll be better on my own.
won't he be surprised to hear from you?
you're supposed to be dead.
exactly, which is why it'd be easier if I see him on my own. It's...
there's a lot of explaining to do.
if you get everything ready, I'll be back soon.
will do.
OK.
I put a trace on the signal Leek was transmitting to the future predator.
there's no chance of making a mistake?
I don't do mistakes...
...often. Not in this case.
that's definitely the location.
come on, then. - Where do you think you're going?
well, where do you think?
this operation's no place for a civilian.
the military will handle it.
under my supervision.
look on the bright side.
at least you're safe here.
I'm supposed to be out there doing something.
I can trace her.
what? Who?
you wanted me to get Rex back.
I could trace Caroline's mobile through the Detector.
Connor, that's an illegal use of government property!
I'm not looking.
is that her? - Yeah.
well, that's where her phone is, anyway.
come on. She'd better still have him.
we've found her!
we're gonna go get Rex back.
I'll come with you!
they'll probably only lose him again anyway.
you can't. Lester said
Lester said that we couldn't go with him. He didn't say that we had to stay here.
Oh, what the hell?
this is it.
are you sure about this?
it doesn't look the kind of place Caroline would hang out in.
maybe it's some kind of retreat.
she was always very er...spiritual.
or maybe you just messed up.
no, this is the place.
OK, gents, body cameras on.
they're here.
this is Caroline's bag.
approaching the door now, sir.
hold your fire. Hold your fire.
entry team, standby. This is the door.
wait!
they're behind this door.
I wondered who was gonna come.
and I was hoping it was gonna be you.
bad LUCK
it's almost like they knew we were coming, sir.
Nick, are you all right?
it's OK.
I'm sorry.
I told them not to hurt you.
what are you doing here?
you're behind this!
Helen has been very helpful. But, please, give a little credit where it's due.
what's going on?
all those creatures! Why are they here?
what are they gonna do with them?
I intend to be very, very powerful.
people are dying and many more will die unless you do something.
I've had enough of this.
there's a whole army of predators out there.
they're too powerful. There's nothing you can do!
then we're all gonna die.
Stephen, open the door!
picking up a very strange signal.
what just happened?
??Losing electrical power.
something's interfering with the systems.
sir, I have an unidentified sonar reading, bearing 20, designate Sierra 155.
it's some sort of...
animal.
can't be affecting systems??
sir, it's big and whatever it is, it's coming straight for us.
sound the collision alarm. Blow all tanks! Take her up!
helmsman, give me full tilt.
I logged into Prospros property portfolio.
And?
last year Philip bought a de-commsioned power station.
tell me what that's about.
can we talk to Connor?
I don't think we can risk that.
if he knew Helen was in any way with Philip, he'd have nothing more to do with him.
you're letting your emotions cloud your judgment.
like you did with Emily?
Emily was a low blow, sorry.
forget about it.
Matt, I did some research.
I found out what happened to her.
I don't want to know.
Emily made her way home and that's all that matters, ok?
Hey. - Hey.
I just have to finish something here, quickly.
what you working on?
I thought the date and calculations were all signed off.
Oh, this is um... this is...
one of those things,
I can't talk about.
sorry.
it's just... It's gonna be good though.
you are coming out with the team though, right?
Yeah, of course. This is part of me job too.
no Connor, this is your other job.
Matt and I have had to cover for you lately.
people are starting to notice.
do you know what? Your right.
I'm sorry, my bad.
okay.
just gonna...
no running in the corridors!
Cordinates: 56: 21. 9, 2: 48. 8
that's a new one. - That's the middle of the North Sea.
Jess speaking.
it's for you, it's the Admiralty.
there was a marine animal caught up on the bridge when we surfaced.
could that have been what attacked your boat?
too small.
it's not like any creature I've seen before.
so where's the body now? - On board.
I'm not happy about this.
captain, we've both got our jobs to do, so let's just get ahead and do them, yeah?
and I don't get how specialist your weapons are, there're not coming on board my boat.
if there's a need for firearms we have a more than adequate armory.
this is all scientific equipment, there's no weapons here.
feel free to make an inspection if you want.
that won't be necessary.
there, an class electrical- diesel boat.
how'd you know that?
I read...
I watch all the movies don't I?
"das Boat."
K-19, "The Widow Maker."
you know, death by drowning, suffocation, radiation poisoning.
gentlemen.
sir.
thank you Shaw.
he's a great little asset .
as good as the Trafarlgar class for sensors and armament.
I thought we'd sold them all off.
no, no, we keep a couple for training exercises.
you know your submarines?
I was in the Royal Marines. Spent a bit of time underwater.
you were army.
the navy would have been my first choice.
take her away gentlemen, forward 13.
aye Captain.
sir.
give me 10 degrees plane. - Aye Captain.
Yes??
Hey.
can I just uh... Can I ask a quick question?
do you get seasick on submarines cause...
I've really got a tendency to uh...
only on the surface.
underwater there's little sensation of movement.
that's good. - Yeah.
good thing.
this is Midshipman Leonard, my sonar officer, Officer Neal, and Officer Shaw.
whatever you're here to do has been classified "Top Secret"
and I'm only permitted a skeleton crew.
sorry about that Captain, you just get us to our station and we'll do our bit.
I've no engineers, no weapons operators and no kitchen staff.
so "your bit" may well involve a mop and bucket in the galley.
we will do whatever it takes.
captain.
I would like to see the creature now please.
aye Captain.
sorry. That hurt.
first thing you learn about life on board a submarine...
think small and thin.
you'll be all right.
it's aft.
right - This way.
we're going to need access to your torpedo bay too.
Why?
captain, like I said, we've got a job to do so just let us get it done and you can drop us on shore in the morning, yeah?
there you go.
now what...
is that?
some kind of theropod, a juvenile.
Thero... what?
pod.
we think some species could swim, not extensively but...
enough to move between islands.
she must have been in the water, sucked through the anomaly.
what's an anomaly?
Oh, that's classified.
but it's a dinosaur right?
a real live, dead, dinosaur.
you were right the first time. - Uh... it's alive?
the North Sea's much colder than she's used to.
she's gone into a state of shock.
we have to keep her that way, can we secure this freezer?
well there's an electrical lock. - Ok good, give me a hand.
she won't bite, unless we don't get her in there fast enough.
thank you.
so this torpedo is going to fire an electronic charge onto the anomaly on impact.
it's basically a mobile underwater locking device.
that's very clever. - Thank you very much.
lock it.
gently.
good work.
listen Matt, umm...
I know I've not really been in the game lately.
it's just this work with Philip, it's... it's exciting and ??
I hope you understand.
I understand.
I know it must be difficult, cause...
I know how Abby feels about Philip.
tell me about it.
you know if you ever want to talk about anything that you can't talk to Abby about you can...
tell your crew that they're not to unlock that freezer under any circumstances, ok?
yes sir.
mum
small theropod, swimmer, still alive.
what? - It's ok, she's secure, she's unconscious.
so how long until we get there?
well the Captain's still charting a course, umm...
it'll be a few hours at least.
you should rest while you can. - Thanks.
it's good to go.
submarines and his commander are here.
Oh, perfect.
Admiral. Welcome to the Anomaly Research Center.
professor Lester.
the Minister briefed me about your little unit several months ago.
I hope your people know what their doing.
I hope yours do too.
if you'd like to step this way, we've established a command center.
I need a dedicated line to the admiralty and another one to Whitehall.
you can establish coms to H. M.S. Garthside, I presume?
of course, their scheduled to send us a signal as soon as they reach the site of the anomaly.
H. M.S. Garthside should be in position anytime now.
this is all rather routine for us these days, why don't you get some sleep.
we'll alert you when the situations resolved.
I'll take a pot of coffee.
us too. Mine with cream, no sugar.
how do you take yours Jess?
frothy, thanks very much Admiral.
I understand your man intends to seal this anomaly by firing a torpedo rewired to pass an electromagnetic charge through it.
that's correct. - Why don't we just blow it up?
we do things different in our "Little Unit."
this man, Connor Temple, he's an elite operative, of course?
Yes. Yes indeed, the very highest caliber.
Connor. - What?
you're doing it again.
I'm not doing anything me feet are down.
she's brilliant.
it's kind of like we're all camping out.
thought you two would have had enough camping in your year in the Cretaceous.
does anybody want to hear a ghost story?
what? It's not like we've got anything to do until we get to the anomaly.
fine.
we're over station Captain.
all stop, two thirds. It's drifting there.
officer Neal, get some coffee on. - Yes sir.
Sam, release the sonar array, let's report our position.
aye Captain.
I sent our position sir.
anything else to add?
it's happening again.
electrical interference. - What the hell is that?
Hey. - Hey.
pull.
We'vd lost primary power... and the Captain.
H. M.S. Garthside. This is the Arc, are you receiving me? Over.
what just happened?
H. M.S. Garthside transmitted their last position, then the coms link went down when I tried to acknowledge.
they're not responding to the radio transmission.
I'll try a data uplink.
they're headed straight for the anomaly.
I'm getting nothing. They're completely out of contact.
suffered a major electrical failure.
the backup systems kicked in but the juice is needed primarily for oxygen supply and emergency lighting.
OK, where's Mr. Neal?
he went to make coffee, I haven't seen him.
Mr. Shaw could you try to find Mr. Neal, thanks.
Sam, get me a damage assessment.
Abby how is he?
he has a bad concussion. He could be out for a while.
we have limited instrumentation, basic navigation but something's jammed the propeller.
right now we're just drifting.
a big metal tube somewhere in the vicinity of a magnetized anomaly.
anyone else see where this is going?
I'm picking up a very strange signal heading straight for us.
it's not heading for us. - We're heading for it.
Where'd...
Where's my submarine?
that's impossible.
we've gone from 150 feet of water to a depth of 120.
we've gone through the anomaly.
could be Jurassic. - Jurassic!
we've no power or steering.
well unless everyone wants to go and swim we better think of something fast.
where in the hell are we? What just happened?
just calm down officer, ok?
well the Jurassic Era, that was like thousands of years ago.
well 200, 245 million years ago if you're gonna be...
what I'm just telling him.
we've just done some freaky time travel thing.
that's what anomalies are.
who are you people?
we're the people who deal with this sort of thing and we're going to need your help.
I'm just a sonar officer.
Sam your senior officer is disabled, that makes you the ranking officer.
OK the first thing we need to do is restore power.
now I need the ships wiring plan, ok, Captain?
good man.
this is the primary electrical grid. I have a hard copy.
right, can you show me the wire that leads to the mainframe power source?
this one.
it's a daisy chain that feeds through four junction boxes throughout the ship.
one maybe more fuses are fried.
OK, this is good, let's check the fuses, repair any damage.
what about the propeller?
we lost signal from the sonar array when we were attacked.
my guess is the cable's got trapped around the propeller.
I'll go. We've got a mini-submersible that I can deploy.
no. I need you here. You're the only person can start this ship again.
it takes two crew. One to steer and one to operate the cutting equipment.
I'll come then. - No. Definitely need you here.
you need to sort this wiring out.
let's get the Captain into a bunk. Me and Abby'll go.
what about the creature that attacked us.
it could have followed us through the anomaly.
it could still be out there.
if we stay close to the sub we may not register.
we may look like another large creature.
ready? - Let's go.
I have absolute faith in my team.
if they decided to enter the anomaly they did so for a good reason.
no.
they've had their chance.
get in touch with the Admiralty and H. M.S. Frost.
move the Vanguard into position.
Vanguard... isn't that a nuclear submarine?
what are you doing?
that anomaly is smack bang in the middle of one of the busiest submarine vectors on the planet.
the Russians, the Americans, the Chinese all sneak around playing hide and seek in in those waters.
can you imagine what would happen if one of their nuclear subs disappeared off the coast of Britain?
could start World War III.
don't worry, it'll take them hours to get the Vanguard into position.
what do you think he's got in that briefcase?
not his sandwiches, that's for sure.
we just have to hope the team reappear before the Admiral opens his Pandora's box.
Sam, I found the first box, three of the fuses are fried and the trip switch is popped, but I... I can fix this.
has Officer Shaw found our missing crewman yet?
officer Shaw please respond.
officer Neal.
officer Neal.
I'll hold this steady and you feed the cable.
OK.
that wasn't me.
Sam was that Shaw?
I think so.
it came from the coms in the storage room. Where that creature was.
what was that?
can't see.
OK, Sam where's the armory? We might need weapons.
only Neal and the Captain have access. I'm just a midshipman.
OK.
seal yourself in the Con.
whatever happens you get Abby and Matt back on board.
OK.
just one more piece to go. Get ready to pull out.
OK.
what the...
come on, come on.
OK, got it.
pliosaur.
pliosaurs.
I'll check outside, see if we're food.
OK, cut the power. - What?
cut the power we're going to play dead.
get ready.
full reverse thrust, ok?
OK.
go.
thank you.
H. M.S. Frost will be on station in 10 minutes to resolve this.
10 minutes?
you've had it on standby all along.
I had a hunch that your people couldn't pull this off.
not underwater... and I was right.
initiate firing control procedures. - Yes sir.
anomalies are my jurisdiction.
national security is mine.
this operation is now under Naval command.
nuking an anomaly won't work.
nuking anything works.
look. All you need to seal this anomaly is to pass an EM pulse through it.
my armament will do that.
and have you considered the implications to the earth's timeline of detonating a nuclear device in a prehistoric era?
we could cease to exist or be turned into pond life.
the Admiralty deemed it an acceptable risk.
have we alerted Washington, Moscow, Shanghai?
you told them about the anomaly.
no. We've told them there's been an accident aboard one of our nuclear submarines and asked them to remove all their personal from the area.
young lady.
I need secure coms to H. M.S. Frost.
those pliosaurs are not going to ignore us for long.
Hey.
any sign of Mr. Shaw? - No.
all right we have to assume the creatures got him.
how do I talk to Connor?
propellers good to go.
there's a pod of pliosaurs out there waiting to get at us.
how you gettiin' on with those fuse boxes?
one more left to find.
OK watch your back. Abby and me are going after the theropod.
Abby you're gonna take the lower deck.
OK.
take this.
here.
serious? - Yeah.
Thanks, what about you?
I'll improvise.
good luck.
can you show me the way? - Come on.
this is great isn't it.
creatures outside where we can't see 'em.
creature inside where we got no lights and no exit.
got to be honest,
I prefer hunting dinosaurs on dry land at least you can see 'em coming.
Connor have you found that final box yet?
well... I'm definitely in the right place, but it looks like someone's relocated the junction without updating the schematic which is... useful.
well hurry up. Without power we can't get back through the anomaly.
really.
OK... Cause there was I thinking we could just all stick our arms out of the portholes and paddle our way back to the 21st century.
uh... sorry, just find it ok?
finding 'em, finding it.
we're taking on water.
Connor! The attack is just going to get more and more sustained.
you need to find that fuse box and fix it... Now!
H. M.S. Frost from Admiral Marsden.
you are authorized to deploy nuclear weapons on target vector 651 Delta.
initiate firing code procedures.
James Lester, I'd like to speak to the Minister please, it's urgent.
Connor. - Uh. Yeah. Friendly Connor.
harmless Connor. Get that spanner out of me face Connor.
you all right? - Yeah.
you find the final fuse box? - No.
not yet.
there's only one last compartment where all the critical wiring runs to and that's down there.
go on then.
thanks very much.
I see.
Thats...
yes Minister, of course.
well... have a good apocalypse.
you're already , you won't notice the difference.
five minutes till they fire.
this part of the sub must have taken the brunt of the attack.
OK.
there it is.
do this, get on the box. - What?
on the box, out of the water.
snarling thing right.
snarling thing.
good work.
all right Matt, we've found the final fuse box.
and captured the theropod.
she's alive.
coms back on?
Yes. - Good.
it won't take much more of this.
how long till we've got enough power to reach ??
not long. At this rate we'll never make it though in one piece.
we're going to have to distract the pliosaurs.
you said you could flood or vent any compartment at any time including the torpedo room, right?
in an emergency, yes.
I think this is an emergency.
Abby. Connor. Take the to the torpedo room, I'll see you there.
t minus 4 minutes.
this is a disproportionate response Admiral.
my people will be dealing with the problem.
your people are long ago and far away.
we have no choice.
killing four of your team, three of mine?
irradiating God knows what era.
I'm sorry Mr. Lester, but this is a matter of global security.
someone has to take these decisions.
regretfully... that's me.
this way.
OK.
no way she's going to fit in there.
she'll have plenty of help. Room fills up with water, pressure sucks her out.
there's too much damage to get more than 30% power but the propellers working again.
t minus 1 minute.
ever considered a sports car.
you know... that whole extension of masculinity thing.
I've got "Dr. Strangelove" on Blu-Ray if that helps.
we need to get out of here. - Sound the engine fire control alley.
Abby, Connor, you can steer the ship. Come on.
come on Matt.
now what do we do? - Full astern.
english please, nobody speaks navy.
backwards.
let's everybody pretend video game, right?
Abby, that is us right there.
that area is the anomaly. You've got to uide us right through the middle, ok.
OK. - Sam.
we're going to go through the anomaly backwards and then you're going to take the war shot, ok.
understood.
distance to the anomaly? - 500 feet.
hold steady.
let's feed these fishes, yeah?
be my guest.
hold it steady you'll be ok.
it's working.
their taking the bait.
come on.
good work everybody but stay in present course and state.
nearly there.
torpedo away.
their back!
and the nuke is heading straight for them.
disarm that torpedo.
H. M.S. Frost, this is the Arc, I have an Admiral Marsden for you.
abort, Abort now.
congratulations Admiral.
you just fired a nuclear weapon in peacetime at one of your own submarines.
depth, 160 feet.
we did it.
OK, Sam, stand by with Connors torpedo.
we're going to seal this anomaly.
what's that? - Incoming torpedo.
planes down 10 degrees. Hard port.
D468won't be taking the shot.
turn left, dive, dive.
it's going to hit them.
what happened there.
they got out of the way.
Yeah, but the nuke is still heading towards the anomaly.
it's heading straight for the anomaly, what shall I do?
we're going to stick with the plan.
let's stop this anomaly.
you two, straight forward.
you ready?
fire!
torpedo away.
there's a second torpedo.
it's Connors.
he's trying to close the anomaly.
H. M.S. Frost I need confirmation of that abort order.
impact!
OK.
good shooting Captain.
bet you're glad I made you play all those video games now.
Yeah.
they did it, the anomaly's locked.
well.
well was the nuke disarmed in time?
they uh... They think so.
well that's reassuring, isn't it?
if not, I think we know what caused the mass extinction of the dinosaurs.
hello.
speaking.
Yes, of course, one moment.
Admiral. - Yes.
it's for you. - Me.
it's the Prime Minister.
yes Prime Minister.
I-I can explain everything.
it's good to breathe fresh air again.
Yeah, I should call Philip.
Hey, no, we're back safe and sound. Listen, I've got an idea.
what's up?
Connor called him as soon as we got back on dry land.
when we started working together, for a moment there it was like it used to be.
Yeah, I know, they should be fine. Yeah, I...
he's full of secrets.
Hey.
come on.
coming home?
listen Abby, I-I I really want to get this finished so...
what's up?
you know how much I believe in you.
and I'm really happy you're enjoying your new work.
But? - But...
there's something not right about Philip.
I don't trust him Connor.
Abby... - You trust my instincts, you always have, and right now my gut is telling me you need to pull away from this.
listen, I-I understand the reasons why you feel the way you do about Philip
I-I totally get it.
the menagerie thing that's - It's not about the creatures.
you just gotta trust me on this.
how bout you trust me?
Philip's a good man.
and what we're working on, it's important and if it all works out the way we want it to, it's...
it's gonna be so important.
I'll see you at home.
Abby, I promise you, when this is all finished you'll be proud of me.
I was already proud of you.
you ok? - Yeah.
look... I know your mission is more important than any of us.
but it's not the only thing that matters.
what's this.
you want to know what happened to Emily.
I know you do.
can I just, you know, look at it for a minute?
you're an artist, Sid.
you're telling me you're just gonna walk out of here and I'm never going to see it again.
there's a good chance of that, yes.
most guys, you know, for the first one, they start with something small.
"mom," girlfriend's initials, something like that.
not you.
you get a full set of sleeves, all in a couple of months.
takes guys a few years to get the ink you got.
I don't have a few years.
wish to hell I did.
the vault. Open it.
we can't. The branch manager's not here.
where is he?
it's lunchtime.
he's at White Castle.
white Castle?
it's a fast food restaurant.
I know what it is. those little squ
I'm not playing games.
open it.
sir, you have a half a million dollars cash in your bag.
don't you think it would be better...?
man: This is the police.
you are completely surrounded.
put down your weapon.
put down your weapon now.
judge: Rarely in the case of armed robbery do we hear a plea of no contest.
are you sure about this, Mr. Scofield?
I'm sure, Your Honor.
your Honor, we'd like to recess if we could. My client's a bit confused at the moment.
I'm not, Your Honor.
he is, Your Honor.
perhaps you should heed your representation's advice, take some additional time to consider your response.
I've already done that, Your Honor.
I'll retire to my chambers to determine sentencing.
court's recessed until 1: 30.
come on, Let's go.
uncle Mike?
I didn't want you to come.
go home, LJ.
I didn't want you to see this.
na take this well.
can you blame him? He's your nephew.
he's beginet that anybody he attaches himself to is gonna end up in prison...
and he's not the only one who's starting to feel that way, Michael.
will you give us a minute?
one minute.
don't you understand?
and she's gonna lob it at you like a grenade.
justice and punishment are the same thing to her.
I know.
then will you please tell me what's going through your head?
we've been over this.
I've known you my entire life.
you don't have a violent bone in your body, and I know you didn't need the money.
why won't you let me help you?
you've been good to me.
my whole life, you have...
but you've gotta let me deal with this.
okay?
given your lack of prior criminal conduct,
I am inclined toward probation.
however, the fact that you discharged a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime suggests malice to me.
for that reason, I find it incumbent that you see the inside of a prison cell, Mr. Scofield.
it says here that you've requested to be incarcerated somewhere near your home here in Chicago.
I'm willing to honor that.
the closest level one facility to...
level one?
that's maximum security, Your Honor.
I would ask counsel to refrain from interrupting me.
as I was saying, the closest level one facility would be Fox River State Penitentiary.
as for the term of your sentence, I'm setting it at five years.
you'll be eligible for parole in half that time.
sentence to be carried out immediately.
man: All right, people, step inside the door and check yourself for bugs.
when you hear the knock, step out.
keep the line moving.
we ain't got all day to get this done.
let's go. Move it. No more talking in line.
move it. You got less than five minutes to take a shower.
keep the line moving. Keep it moving.
move it. Right now. Let's go. Move, move. Next!
next down in the banks, dress.
let's go.
name and back number.
are you a religious man, Scofield?
never really thought about it.
good, 'cause the Ten Commandments don't mean a box of piss in here.
we got two commandments and two only.
the first commandment is you got nothing coming.
what's the second commandment?
see commandment number one.
gotcha.
you talking out the side of your neck?
come again?
I said, are you being a smartass?
just trying to fly low, avoid the radar, boss.
do my time... and get out.
there isn't any flying under my radar.
good to know.
Hey, can a brother get some air conditioning up here, coach?
it's hotter than a crack ho's mouth, man.
to hell with the A. C. man.
give me the crack ho.
come on!
yo, Fish!
what you looking at?
you look kind of pretty to be up in here, man.
I suggest you take a seat, Fish.
ain't nothing to do ain't nobody gonna serve it for you.
welcome to Prisneyland, Fish.
you wanna talk about it?
no, it's not worth talking about.
if it's keeping you up, it is.
Oh, it's just...
it's nothing, you know.
Michael's case.
you did the best you could.
Yeah, but he didn't.
he just sort of rolled over.
he didn't put up a fight.
it's not like him.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about him.
Hey, if it's on your mind, it's on your mind, right?
good night.
man: All wings, guard coming out.
all wings, guard coming out.
Trey Street Deuces got the hoops.
Nortenos got the bleachers.
woods got the weight pile.
the C. O.s got the rest.
I'm telling you, the guards are the dirtiest gang in this whole place.
the only difference between us and them...
is the badge.
who's the pet lover?
he'll deny it, but he's D. B. Cooper.
parachuted out of a plane 30 years ago with a million and a half in cash.
doesn't look like the type.
who does?
Hey! What up, Wholesale?
you okay?
gonna be greater later.
Yeah.
what you doing with this fish, man?
he's my new cellie.
Wholesale's got it wired up out of commissary.
anything you want, he can get it for you.
you keep handing out my jacket,
I swear I'm gonna bust your grape.
man, you couldn't bust a grape in Napa with a set of cleats on.
what are you talking about?
man, you want to bump your gums.
Oh, no, no. Now you're talking, talking, talking...
I'm looking for someone.
guy named Lincoln Burrows.
that what they're calling him now?
Yeah.
as in, he'll come at you with everything but the kitchen... Snowflake.
where can I find him?
SUCRE: Man killed the vice-president's brother.
and in a month, he's getting the chair, which means no one up this river is more dangerous than him, 'cause he's got nothing' to lose now.
what are they gonna do? Kill him twice?
there a way I can get to him?
Oh, no. The only time those boys get out is for chapel and P. I.
prison Industry.
the guys that get along, get to work.
you know, painting, scrapping, making mattresses, you name it.
I wouldn't get excited, though, if I were you, Fish.
you sniffing' none of P. I.
Why's that?
cause John Abruzzi runs it.
why you wanna see Burrows so bad anyhow?
because he's my brother.
may 11. That's the date, man.
that's the date they, uh... you know...
execute me.
I know.
I didn't kill that man, Michael.
the evidence says you did.
I don't care what the evidence says.
I didn't kill him.
swear to me.
I swear to you, Michael.
but how did they get it wrong then?
the courts, the appeals...
don't know. Don't know.
all I keep thinking, looking back on it is, uh...
I was set up.
and, whoever it was that set me up wants me in the ground as quickly as possible.
what's another word for "love"?
what's the context?
Oh, you know.
the "I love you so much "I ain't never knocking over "a liquor store again" context.
except, you know, classy.
Mmm.
I'm proposing to my girl, if you gotta know.
in a letter?
you got a better way?
face-to-face works pretty good.
this place ain't exactly he romantic spot.
I'm gonna have her go get on the Staten Island Ferry.
then, once she can see the Empire State Building, she opens Ex that I won't be there. ikng there
try "passion."
Ooh! Ooh! "Passion. Passion" That's dope.
passion.
how do you spell that?
is it "pash..."? Uh-uh.
no "h"?
LJ, hold up.
hold up.
I don't think I can go through with this.
everything's going to be fine.
trust me.
we understand each other, then?
Yeah. Friday.
not Saturday. Not Sunday. Friday.
totally understood.
I don't want hundreds, I don't want fives, I don't want ones.
I know, I know.
tens and 20s only.
it's on.
police!
Abruzzi, I need you to hire me a P. I.
beat it.
maybe you ought to hear what I got to say.
you got nothing I need.
wouldn't be too sure of that.
my mistake.
just what I need... a duck.
a P. I. Abruzzi.
you might find I can be of more assistance than you think.
mull it over.
come find me when you're ready to talk.
all right, guys, pick it up!
I want to get home tonight!
yeah? So?
that's the son of a bitch that fingered Abruzzi.
that's Fibanacci?
I thought the punk was gone forever.
evidently, somebody found him.
somebody messing with us?
this you're not going to believe.
what is it?
tattoo looks fresh. Hold that.
I guess, being a diabetic, you don't mind needles.
I'm Michael, by the way.
Scofield. I read your report.
and you are?
Dr. Tancredi will do.
Tancredi like the governor?
you're not related, are you?
huh. Wouldn't think you'd find the daughter of Frontier Justice Frank working in a prison.
as a doctor, no less.
I believe in being part of the solution, not the problem.
Mmm. "Be the change you want to see in the world."
what?
nothing. That was just my senior quote.
that was you?
this whole time, I was thinking it was Gandhi.
you're very funny.
sit tight. Put direct pressure on that.
I'll be back in a sec.
so, how do we play this?
you hook me up with a few weeks' supply?
nice try. No hypos on the floor.
I'm the farthest thing from a junkie. Trust me.
I got news for you, Michael.
trust me" means absolutely zero inside these walls.
the only way you're getting that insulin is if I'm administering it.
guess we'll be seeing a lot of each other, then, huh?
I guess so.
we're all clear on the Burrows execution.
good. Except for one thing.
Bishop McMorrow is not in the fold.
he's got a lot of influence with the governor.
they went to prep school together, apparently.
look, the closer it gets, the more I'm worried that the bottom is going to fall out of this whole thing.
well, maybe it's time you arranged a visit with the good bishop then.
look, in one month, it'll all be over.
the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and, the third day, rise again.
and they remembered his words, and so should you.
good day, gentlemen.
may God be with you.
guard: Let's go, let's go, let's go.
guard: Let's go. Come on, man. Keep moving.
keep moving. Move. Come on.
Why?
I'm getting you out of here.
Burrows, roll it up. Happy hour's over.
it's impossible.
not if you design the place that isn't.
too formal.
too greeting card.
make a decision sooner or later, you know.
, actually.
I mean, at some point, we got to pull the trigger on this thing.
I don't want to rush this.
we're only going to do it once.
we have to get it right.
honey, can I ask you something?
of course.
are you putting this off?
what do you mean?
I... I mean, are you having second thoughts?
no. Honey, no.
I'm not.
I don't know.
I just can't help thinking this is about... Not.
I love you...
and I want to be your wife.
SUCRE: Passion?
what were you thinking?
Hey, you went for it.
she probably thinks I went sissy up in here.
"passion." Got more than one syllable, too much talking.
that's me from now on.
one-syllable Sucre.
Yes. No. Love. Hate. Love.
give it time.
are you kidding?
I proposed to her.
that doesn't take time.
si or no.
one syllable, man.
she's supposed to come around for a conjugal on Tuesday.
she's always calling me beforehand, letting me know she's coming.
this time, man, I ain't heard a peep.
you spooked her.
get it together.
Pope wants to see you.
no good, Fish.
no one gets an audience with the Pope.
not unless he's real interested in what you got going on.
pope: Top of your class at Loyola.
magna cum laude, in fact.
I can't help wondering what someone with your credentials is doing in a place like this.
took a wrong turn a few months back, I guess.
you make it sound like a traffic infraction.
like all you did was turn the wrong way up a one-way street.
everyone turns up one sooner or later.
the reason I called you here...
I noticed in your I-file, under occupation, you put down 'unemployed.'
that's not true, now, is it?
I know you're a structural engineer, Scofield.
shah Jahan built the Taj Majal as a monument to his undying love for his wife.
my wife is quite fond of the story.
it appeals to the romantic in her.
being married to someone in Corrections... terrible job.
wouldn't wish it on anyone.
and yet, in 39 years my wife has never complained.
and the worst part about it is, I've never thanked her.
so, because I couldn't say it,
I thought, you know, I could build it.
come June, it's our 40th anniversary.
but here, look...
you see, the problem is...
I build anymore, it's all gonna come down like a house of cards.
that's where I was hoping you could be of assistance.
for the favor, I can offer you three days of work a week in here.
and it'll keep you off the yard.
I can't do it.
son, it's better for me to owe you one in here than it is for you to owe me one, I can promise you that.
I'll take my chances.
then we're through here.
guard!
two pounds of pot?
what were you trying to do, set a record?
it's not funny, LJ.
you could be going to jail.
it's pretty obvious to me you need some guidance.
Hey.
Thanks.
from who, old Daddy Warbucks?
give him a chance. He's a good man.
we got nothing in common.
where is this coming from, LJ?
last semester you were getting almost all A's and now...
it's your father, isn't it?
I don't have a father.
it wasn't an immaculate conception, honey.
maybe it's time we went and saw him.
mom...
ma...
don't.
I'm about as excited by the prospect as you are, but something's gotta give.
you have got too much potential to be screwing up your life like this.
what if they'd sent you to Taylorville or Marion and not here?
I think I'd be doing the same thing I'm doing here.
eating Jell-O, drinking Kool-Aid...
I know what you're doing.
it's not luck of the draw that you're in here with Lincoln.
you forget I know you.
both of you.
you two have the most dysfunctional idea of love I've ever seen.
what, he beats you up to keep you off the streets, so you get yourself tossed into Fox River with him?
to what?
I deserve to know.
I loved him as much as you did.
past tense for you, maybe.
not me.
I gave him a shot when I got back from college.
I did everything I could to make it work.
and he threw it away.
you ever think maybe he was hurt that you left in the first place?
don't do this.
whatever it is you're doing, don't do it.
there's a better way.
I'm already appealing your case.
I told you to leave...
I've gotten in touch with the diocese about Lincoln. The bishop...
that won't stop it.
it'll only delay it.
you want to do something?
you find out who's trying to bury him.
nobody's trying to bury him.
the evidence was there.
the evidence was cooked.
man: Visiting hours are now over.
take care of yourself.
someone wants him dead, Veronica.
something more is going on here.
this is desperation, Michael.
you're grabbing at straws.
you're in denial. Maybe.
but I can't watch him die.
I won't do that.
gentlemen...
what is it about the Burrows situation that I can help you with?
it's our understanding that you have great influence with the governor.
I wouldn't say it's great or influence.
we're friends.
it's also our understanding that you oppose thnalty.
I'm a man of God.
how could I not?
in this case, we're hoping you'll suspend that position.
at least temporarily.
if the inmate appeals to me for intervention, how can I turn my back on him?
you have a habit of answering a question with a question.
and you have a way of asking questions that beg more questions.
are you saying you won't do it?
I'm not a man to equivocate.
you're what... 62 years old now,
your Excellency.
that's right.
I would assume, then, that you'd be well-versed in how our government's tax system works.
taking personal capital gains under the church's tax shelter...
well, that would be fraud, wouldn't it, Your Excellency?
I will not be cowed into forsaking my beliefs.
not by you or anyone else.
admirable.
good day, Excellency.
Mr. Kellerman...
what is it about this case that the Secret Service is so interested in?
the man killed the vice-president's brother.
What'd he say?
you heard me.
someone found Fibanacci.
I'm looking at the photos right now.
son of a bitch has a beard, sunglasses...
witness Protection, if I ever saw.
who was this someone?
Oh, there's no return address on the envelope.
just... this folded-up bird made of paper.
like origami?
Yeah, like that.
like origami.
you're Charles Westmoreland, right?
do I know you?
I knew your wife before she passed.
you knew Marla?
you mean Anne?
how'd you know her?
we talked together in Boston.
east Farmington.
you mean West Wilmington?
no more tests.
I promise.
seems you know everything about me.
who are you?
how'd you get it in here?
first off, she's not an it.
she's Marilyn and she's grandfathered back from the days when prisoners were allowed a creature comfort or two.
I heard you were D. B. Cooper.
every new fish comes in here, first thing they hear, is that Charles Westmoreland is D. B. Cooper.
I'll tell you like I tell them...
you want the Cooper story?
I can't give it to you, 'cause I'm not him.
it's too bad.
sort of wish it was true.
the man's a legend.
nowhere near as much as I wish it was true, friend.
I'd have a million-five waiting for me on the outside.
I'd put some grass under them if I were you.
this thing would go a whole lot easier if you'd just hire me.
what is this all about?
say you were able to get outside those walls?
would you have the people in place to make sure you disappeared forever?
what do you care?
just curious.
Where's Fibanacci?
that's not the way it works.
they come at me, John... I'm coming after you.
I doubt it.
prisoners: Fight, fight, fight...
I totally misjudged you, Scofield.
I didn't think you were agitating type.
behavior like that will not be tolerated in my prison.
90 days in the SHU!
that ought to be enough time to convince you of that fact. 90 days.
that's right.
something you want to say?
it's just...
I'm not of much value to you in the SHU.
value?
Hm-mm... the Taj.
it'd be a shame if the eighth wonder of the modern world collapsed because the stress is improperly propagated.
improperly propagated?
improperly propagated.
the joints are overloaded.
they won't provide anywhere near the sheer strength the completed structure will need.
ch work are we talking?
you want it by when, in June?
Yes.
then we'd better get started, wouldn't you say?
who's there?
Bishop McMorrow was killed last night.
someone shot him while he was sleeping.
I thought you'd want to know.
Thanks.
michael was right.
sink, you got a visitor.
（uzzes)
he was arrested.
possession F of marijuana.
I figured he could use some fatherly advice before it's...
didn't mean that.
I know you didn't.
Thanks, Lisa.
sit down.
using or dealing?
what's the difference?
then what, you, uh, think it gives you ocred?
you got a piece so take advantage.
look, I get it.
the whole thing.
she drags me in here, you give me a big speech, I walk away a changed man.
straight "A's.
Harvard.
grow up and be a dentist.
it's better than being here.
you got to realize who's getting punished when you're doing the things you're doing.
you think it's me; it's you.
I did the same thing
punished the old man，'cause he was gone.
look where it got me.
I'm not asking you to love me.
I already screwed up that chance long ago.
I'm asking you to love yourself.
you can still put the brakes on this thing.
so, that's what fatherly advice is like.
where are you going?
I got homework.
they're putting me to death, LJ.
in a month's time, I'll be dead.
you get that?
you're already dead to me.
Yes.
w-what? You mean yes yes?
: Yes!
Oh, there's just one thing.
of course.
mama wants us to wait till you get out.
of course, mi amor.
Oh, and we have to get married in a church.
okay. Esta bien. A Catholic church.
wouldn't want to mess with the Catholic roots, would we?
you went to Loyola.
you've been checking up on me.
I like to get to know my patients.
I went to Northwestern.
graduated two years after you did.
maybe we met before-- you know, drunk, out at a bar somewhere.
I would have remembered.
that a compliment?
no.
hmm.
what?
your blood glucose is at 50 milligrams per deciliter.
so? That's hypoglycemic.
your body's reacting to the insulin like you're not a diabetic.
you're sure it's Type One diabetes you've got?
ever since I was a kid.
all right.
you're not experiencing any tingling sensation, cold sweats or...
infirmary.
Yes.
Yeah.
I did.
no, I did and I do; I need them.
okay. Um, great, well, I'll call him after lunch, then.
thanks; I'm with a patient. Okay.
I'd like to run some tests next time you're in.
last thing I want is to be administering insulin to a man who Yeah; sure.
okay.
how'd you get here, by the way?
Oh, you know.
I don't; that's why I asked.
: you know. Hector.
What?!
I didn't have any money for the bus, so he offered me a ride.
he was really sweet.
honey, he's just a friend.
no, he's not "just a friend."
I know Hector; I know men.
men and women can't be friends.
a guy doesn't drive a girl 500 miles across state lines because he wants to be friends.
guard: Casanova, wrap it up.
Hey, you got nothing to worry about, okay?
it's you I'm marrying.
it's not you I'm worried about.
16 more months.
I love you.
be easy, son, all right?
sucre tells me you're the local pharmacy.
what you need, man?
I only speak English, white boy.
it's an insulin blocker.
standard over-the-counter variety.
you can get it at any pharmacy.
you can get that at medical then.
I can't get it at medical.
why not?
because they're already giving me insulin shots.
you're one mixed-up cracker, you know that?
can you get it for me, or not?
only if you tell me why it is that you want to keep going back up to medical to get a insulin shot for which you don't need.
I like the ambiance.
Uh-huh.
we in business?
man: All personnel, Facility Two lockdown in 20 minutes.
facility One lockdown in ten minutes.
Scofield. I don't know what you did, but Abruzzi wanted me to give you this P. I. card.
Congratulations.
you just joined the ranks of the employed.
kudos, Fish.
you got spine.
all right, cons, break it down!
move it, guys.
saw Veronica came by yesterday.
still engaged to that guy?
Yup.
could have been me.
if you hadn't estruc?
I was just being stupid.
hurt.
shouldn't have pushed her away, though.
you pushed everyone away.
I'm an anchor.
all I'll do is drag him down with me.
why did you hire him?
keep your friends close and your enemies closer.
you mean what you said earlier?
I'm not here on vacation; trust me.
getting outside these walls, that's just the beginning.
you're going to need money.
I'll have it.
and people on the outside
people that can help you disappear.
I've already got them.
they just don't know it yet,
look, whatever you got going on, fill me in, 'cause I'm in the dark here.
chaparral Associates got the contract to retrofit this place in '99.
$4 million contract.
head partner couldn't crack it.
so, he subcontracted out-- an under-the-table sort of deal with a former associate.
that guy was one of the partners in my firm.
we basically ghost-wrote the whole plan
crossed the "t's," dotted the "i's," grouted the tiles.
you've seen the blueprints.
better than that.
I've got them on me.
are you kidding me?
I didn't kill that man, Michael.
if you didn't kill Terrence Steadman, how the hell did someone make it look like you did?
I'm getting you out of here.
that's impossible.
not if you designed the place, it isn't.
better be open, bro.
you're asking me to break the law.
I'm asking you to make a mistake; forget to lock up.
we're in.
who killed Terrence Steadman?
nobody.
Terrence Steadman's still alive.
Hello, Terrence.
sound the alarm!
what's going on?
Hey!
No!
No!
what do we do now?
we run.
the escapees, who were they?
got a list right here.
read it to me, if you could.
michael Scofield, structural engineer, five years for armed robbery.
former U. S.Army, eight years for possession of stolen goods.
don of the crime family of the same name.
life without parole for conspiracy to commit murder.
60 years for second-degree murder.
five years for aggravated robbery.
five years for grand larceny.
life for six counts of kidnapping, rape and first-degree murder.
scheduled to die next week for the murder of president Reynold's brother.
how long has it been since they got over the wall?
8: 00 last night.
Scofield-- he and Burrows were brothers.
that's right.
and he's the mastermind of this whole thing.
that's what they're saying.
I want everything they've got on him.
where are they?
what the hell is that?
let's go.
all we got to do is make it to the other side.
what?
make it to the other side.
come on, guys!
pick it up!
the thing is gaining speed, man!
it's going too fast!
go through!
what?
go through!
Freeze!
I will gun you down, Scofield!
Where's the aerial and the others?
they're back on the ground refueling.
son of a bitch.
< Manhunt >
sir, media's ready.
I'd like to, uh, talk about John Wilkes Booth for a moment if I could, abraham Lincoln's killer.
12 days, that's how long it took to find him.
in his journal during this period, he wrote that the shadow was his friend, the night his domain.
he acknowledged that whatever neuroses drove the criminal to commit the original crime is compounded, magnified by flight, by the sounds of dogs at his heels.
fear becomes paranoia, paranoia ultimately psychosis.
I bring this up, because, in 140 years, the fundamental mind of the escaped man has not changed.
the escaped man is still human.
he is still afraid, and he will stop at nothing in his attempt at flight.
fortunately for us, while our quarry has shadow and night as his ally, we have something far greater:
television.
I would encourage everyone who is watching, everyone in this country to take a good look at these faces.
these men right here are now the eight-most-wanted men in America.
I thought I thought this out.
you saw all those guys back there?
the key is they're back there, and we're up here.
Yeah, and how long is that going to last?
Yeah, especially since we don't have a pot to piss in thanks to Abruzzi's magically disappearing jet.
Hey, you were never going to be on that plane, brother.
and don't think I don't know where you were going either, Scofield.
where am I going?
Oh, I don't know. Utah?
when were you planning on telling us about the money, man?
what money?
$5 million that westmoreland planted in the desert in Utah.
you don't know what you're talking about.
you wish I didn't know.
wait, wait. What money?
warden?
it's a little early for the FBI to be showing up, don't you think?
look, I get it.
it's still your investigation, but once those criminals cross state lines, it'll become a federal matter.
Yeah, well, that is not going to happen.
I hope you're right.
that's why I was going to suggest that we cut through any interagency politics from the outset.
full transparency.
Absolutely.
good.
then maybe you can tell me about dr. Tancredi.
there's nothing to tell.
from what I'm hearing, she may have abetted the escapees;
opened the door that allowed them to get out.
like I said, there's nothing to tell.
you're not being very transparent, warden.
look, I don't discuss my staff.
maybe you should, because she may be the key to this thing.
we need to speak with her.
right now, Mr. Mahone, she's not going to be talking with anyone.
how are we doing?
well, the ivs are hydrating her.
we got her on a naloxone infusion, half milligram per hour.
what do you think the chances are?
well, we've done everything on our end. It's really up to her.
either she fights and lives, or she quits and dies.
Hey! What do you think...
do whatevething you got to do, man.
Oh, and...
boy...
you call the cops, I will put this thing right here in your eye.
thank you.
structural engineer, huh?
not the kind you'd expect to get that much ink.
not the kind at all.
how long do you think it'd take to get something like that?
hundred hours...
200
tattoo artist who gave it to him must have spent a lot of time on him then.
I'll find out who it was.
Mr. Bellick.
don't talk to me.
fine, but it's going to make collaboration kind of hard.
collaboration?
I got men out here in harm's way, and you're giving press conferences.
the press is a tool.
it'll bring those men back quicker than bloodhounds will.
we don't need you.
we're hot on these guys' trail, and it's just a matter of time till we nail them.
the problem I find with being on a trail is that by definition you'll always be behind your prey.
we'll see about that.
[BLACKFOOT. MONTANA]
I'm not armed.
you'll have to excuse me if I'm a little short on trust at the moment.
I assure you, young woman, I'm the furthest thing from a threat.
I think the percocet pretty much ensures that.
good, then you won't mind if I capture this moment for posterity.
won't do you any good.
you don't care that soone's going to be executed for your murder while you're just sitting here.
I'm not the one choose Lincoln Burrows as the fall guy.
who did?
your sister, the president?
you don't understand. I'm a prisoner to all of this.
Oh, come on. You could have come forward.
you could have stopped this thing before it even got started.
no, I really am a prisoner.
and now, you are, too.
the moment you let that door shut behind you.
didn't it strike you as curious that there wasn't any security out there? The doors only open from the outside.
the glass is two inches thick, bulletproof.
there's no getting out of here, young woman.
we got to dump them now.
can't.
they know about Utah.
all the more reason to dump them.
if they get caught, they FEDs will know exactly where we're going.
they'll tell them.
we just got to make sure they stay afloat until we're off in utah, doing what we got to do.
you really think the money's going to be there?
Charles might have had a flexible relationship with the truth, but at the end...
at the end, there'd be no reason for him to lie about it.
I figure once we bag it, we cross over into Mexico, take a whole bunch of mpy second-class bus rides till we hit Panama.
you really got a fix on this dive shop thing, huh?
Yeah.
right now, I wouldn't mind swinging in a hammock for the next ten or 20 years.
we got half the country after us. We ain't making it to panama or utah.
not without help.
Veronica can't help us.
how can you say that?
we don't have money, clothes... -I already got all that.
I thought the plan was Abruzzi's jet.
Abruzzi's jet was plan A.
then we got... -everything we need.
where?
storage.
Scofield designed the tattoo, not you?
he brought the entire thing in, every element.
I mean, look at it; it's the Freakin' sistine chapel.
I knew the guy was an engineer or whatever, but man, his skill as an artist was unbelievable.
what else? What can you tell me about him as a person?
he was cool, you know.
but talk about a detail nazi.
everything had to be perfect, exactly as he drew it.
I always sort of had the feeling that the whole thing was some sort of inside joke that only he was in on.
we have your number, right?
I may be calling you.
thank you.
what was the name of that long road we took to get to the prison?
and out in front of the prison, the two streets that intersect with it?
Fitz and Percy. Why?
thank you.
saddle up.
where we going?
somewhere where we can stop being cons and start being civilians.
you know, why don't you cut out all the riddles, snowflake, and just give it to us straight.
what?
Hi.
little one.
what are you doing?
we're just fishing.
with no poles?
we like to fish with our hands.
Yes, eh...hand-fishing.
I think the question is, what are you doing out here?
hunting. -Gracie?
get away
Gracie, get away.
get back
you're those guys from Fox river.
don't-don't any of you move a Freakin' muscle.
get away from her.
get away from her!
okay, okay, just.
relax, relax.
sir...
you stay where you are.
no
put the gun down.
let her go. -Right now.
you let her go!
let go of the girl.
shut up!
John, put the girl down.
drop the gun
drop the gun!
drop it now.
put the gun down.
one.
I'll pull the trigger.
two!
good boy.
good boy
get the gun.
pick it up!
don't you hurt her, don't you...
you're going to be all right.
run to daddy.
I ain't going to say anything, to anybody, man.
you are not get hurt, so just calm down
Where's your car?
up on the road.
keys.
you're being considered an accessory to this;
you know that, don't you?
I know very little right now.
you opened the door to the infirmary that allowed Scofield to escape, didn't you?
did you have a sexual relationship with Scofield?
no.
but you had feelings for him.
seven other men got out, you know.
who?
I am sorry, sir.
it's saturday; we're not open.
that's sort of the point.
sorry, sir?
see,
I'm going to need some work done, and I'm going to need it done privately.
I'm sorry, you said you needed the work done?
this is a medical clinic, isn't it?
of course it is, sir, but for animals.
man, what happened to you?
you need medical attention.
sir, listen...
hold up.
I'm going to get an ambulance.
nobody's going to be doing any calling here, doctor.
fine.
wh-what do you want?
you know what?
that's it.
I want eye-tie out of the car right now, man.
that was a little girl!
don't you have a heart?
God! I have a daughter.
I have a little girl!
I got one, too.
but if I hadn't done what I had to do, we wouldn't be on our way to see 'em right now, would we?
turn right up there.
hold on.
where we going?
that's west, man.
we need to go east.
my family's back in Chicago.
and you think the cops don't know about it?
you think they're not just sitting there, waiting for you to come running back home?
what's the matter with you?
what about New York?
what about I my girl's pregnant, bro.
understand your love is your weakness right now, and they know about it.
doesn't mean it has to stop you.
you just got to be smart about it.
get to Oswego.
Oswego was not on the way, snowflake.
it's not where Oswego is.
it's what's in Oswego.
captain, Scofield's credit card transaction history.
spent a lot of money here in Will county before he was incarcerated?
exactly.
he was from Chicago.
why does a guy from Chicago come all the way out here and spend north of eight grand in all these places in little over a month?
car wash, voice mail, storage, car rental...
we got guys looking into it.
good.
captain, what about the FEDs?
should we tell them?
what do you think?
captain Bellick?
we got something.
hunter up by tamarack just ran into five of the cons.
so this is where Scofield lived?
up until about two months ago when he was incarcerated.
mother's dead, father's a deadbeat.
you got nothing in the whole world but your brother.
so you plan.
and you scheme for months...
till you get it right.
every single element.
and then you destroy all the evidence.
I want divers down in the river.
you won't get cell coverage.
we're in the middle of nowhere.
digital carriers don't have cell towers way out here in western montana.
how about shutting up, Terrence?
just trying to save you some effort.
they're like a web, these people.
the harder you struggle, the worse it gets.
sounds to me like a coward trying to justify himself.
if I stay out of the way and stay quiet,
I stay alive.
that's what they said; that's what they told me.
and you're willing to live like this, in a hermetically-sealed box while everything out there goes to hell?
self-preservation is a strong motivator.
so is the truth.
don't.
young woman?
do not don't
how you doing, buddy?
I'm pretty freaked out, that's how I'm doing.
they took your car, didn't they?
1978 grand Cherokee.
which way did they go?
up that way north toward Oswego.
pardon me.
Scofield's paperwork- get it, jimmy.
the credit card stuff.
right here, captain.
of course.
where is he going to put all the crap you need to disappear?
we're going to Oswego, boys.
you have a visitor
thank U.
Thanks.
you look disappointed.
no. I thought you were going to be my father.
you heard from him?
his office.
brought you a change of clothes.
figured, you know...
Thanks.
and your purse.
you left it in the infmary.
I'm in a lot of trouble, I think.
I,
I need to apologize to you.
they threatened my job if I didn't talk, and...
no, no, no, no.
no.
one thing you learn when you're walking the steps is that you never outsource a blame that belongs in your own backyard.
you're not the first correctional worker that fell for a con, trust me.
he never cared.
not one bit.
what are you thinking about?
mistakes.
you had to do it.
not like I did.
I ruined her life.
there's nothing you can do about it now.
that's not true.
you fell for her, huh?
Where's Oswego?
half mile maybe good.
what are you going to do, Terrence, shoot me?
blow my guts all over this house?
then what?
you can't leave, remember?
you kill me, you're stuck with me.
I'm safe here.
you're a prisoner here.
but I'm still breathing.
if I go outside one step,
I won't be.
you look at me...
like I'm the devil.
I gave up my family.
my teeth.
I eat percocet all day just to dull the pain of my miserable existence.
you have no idea what I've been through.
what you've been through?
this isn't about you, Terrence
don't.
Blackfoot Sheriff's department.
hello.
Blackfoot Sheriff's department
my name's Veronica Donovan.
I need you to send a unit to the house at the end of light road as soon as possible.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but are you calling to report a crime?
by the president of the united states.
send the car.
I'm sorry, sir,
I-I don't think I can do this.
there are nerves...
Llook, you need a specialist, okay?
I don't...
you-you need somebody who knows what they're doing.
I don't have the ly of choice here, doctor.
my hand has been in that box for hours now.
it is dying.
sir, I am not capable of doing this.
I only have one hand, but I could stick this in your neck before you get to that door.
now, if that's not incentive enough for you,
I see that you have a Mrs. Gudat out there.
with a name like that in a county like this, old Mrs. Gudat would not be too hard to find now, would she?
fine.
I can promise you nothing.
story of my life.
I'll have to put you under.
do I really look that stupid?
sir, I cannot do a procedure like this without an anesthetic.
I have to cut away dead flesh.
nobody can undergo a procedure like this without an anesthetic!
I ain't nobody.
schweitzer was the plumbing company that made the toilet Scofield took off to get out of his cell.
allen Boltas the fitting.
it's all here, isn't it?
it's amazing.
there a place in the vicinity with that name?
got someone looking into it.
doc's moving on a storage facility in Oswego.
captain, manager says that Scofield's got a lease on unit 164.
it's still active.
we got guys on 8th street, 3rd street, then the alley.
if they're in there, captain, we got 'em boxed.
we push right up the gut, then.
any one of them makes a threatening move, put a hole in 'em.
you got it.
officer...
this is my collar, smart guy.
back the hell off.
close the door.
still nothing on this place?
Nope. They're coming back with nothing.
no place by that name anywhere in this country.
or any other country, for that matter.
let's go.
son of a bitch set us up.
not one word.
officer...
nothing.
Oh.
Oh, that kid's clever.
it's not a place, it's a name.
your pda, you got it?
Yeah.
bring up the census of this county.
far back as it goes.
somebody's going to see us.
keep digging.
we're gonna go to hell, guys.
swear to god, we're gonna go to hell.
help me out.
you are one sick cat, you know that?
what are you looking for?
we got to go to the cemetery.
now.
originally, this was supposed to be a week's worth of clothes for me and Linc.
but, uh, figured you all need just as much help as we do, so...
you're just doing this out of the goodness of your heart, fish?
that's right, John, the heart.
you remember what that is, don't you?
damn, snowflake, this is tight, man.
it's like I said, we got to stop being cons start being civilians.
nice.
trousers are a little bit too short, don't you think?
chop your feet off. You're good at that.
this jacket ain't exactly the best thing, you know what I'm saying?
you want variety, hit target.
what do we got?
money, passports...
pre-paid phone cards.
Archie Ryan? - Did you see mine?
these?
keys to a car that's waiting for us a couple hundred yards from here.
that a two-of-us or five-of-us?
that's a two-of-us.
they know?
not yet.
Guy-guy-guys, we got company.
guys, we got to roll.
how did he know?
we're civilians; remember that.
civilians.
I'm sorry, uh.
do you know what time it is?
no, sorry.
I can't go outside.
they'll kill me as soon as I show my face.
you're wrong about that.
as soon as you show your face, this whole thing is gonna be over.
you can have your life back, Terrence.
promise?
I promise.
hello.
V, it's me.
lync --We're out.
thank god you're okay.
I saw the news. You got to stop.
I need you to turn yourself in.
what?
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc. He's alive.
you're going to be exonerated.
come in.
what are you talking about, you found Steadman?
Terrence, come on, let's go.
afternoon. -Veronica.
the police are here.
look, Ied you to stay where you are.
ma'am.
I don't want to lose you.
ma'am, put the phone down.
what?
Mr. Steadman, take a few steps back.
Oh, my god.
I thought you knew that all calls to the local station are routed through us.
this is federal land, remember?
and, uh, as for your little toy here, it's contraband.
you gonna tell us how you got it in there?
I brought it when I got here.
whatever for?
to protect myself.
that's what we're here for, remember?
in less than a day, the trail has gone cold in the pursuit of what are now being called...
Yeah, it's fine
stay on top of it, all right?
doc's still doing a sweep of Oswego, but the guys have basically vanished.
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Mr. Lves.
I don't know how you can be so confident.
it's not like these guys left a map where they're going.
actually, that's exactly what they did.
Scofield had the entire thing on his body
how to get out of that prison, how to disappear afterward.
it's all there.
I promise you that it's only a matter of time before we know everything that is in Scofield's head
where he plans to run to, how he plans to get there.
so when the time comes that he does get there, we'll be waiting for him.
I didn't kill that man, Michael.
if you didn't kill Terrence Steadman, how the hell did someone make it look like you did?
I'm getting you out of here.
that's impossible.
not if you designed the place, it isn't.
better be open, bro.
you're asking me to break the law.
I'm asking you to make a mistake; forget to lock up.
we're in.
who killed Terrence Steadman?
nobody.
Terrence Steadman's still alive.
Hello, Terrence.
sound the alarm!
what's going on?
Hey!
No!
No!
what do we do now?
we run.
the escapees, who were they?
got a list right here.
read it to me, if you could.
michael Scofield, structural engineer, five years for armed robbery.
former U. S.Army, eight years for possession of stolen goods.
don of the crime family of the same name.
life without parole for conspiracy to commit murder.
60 years for second-degree murder.
five years for aggravated robbery.
five years for grand larceny.
life for six counts of kidnapping, rape and first-degree murder.
scheduled to die next week for the murder of president Reynold's brother.
how long has it been since they got over the wall?
8: 00 last night.
Scofield-- he and Burrows were brothers.
that's right.
and he's the mastermind of this whole thing.
that's what they're saying.
I want everything they've got on him.
where are they?
what the hell is that?
let's go.
all we got to do is make it to the other side.
what?
make it to the other side.
come on, guys!
pick it up!
the thing is gaining speed, man!
it's going too fast!
go through!
what?
go through!
Freeze!
I will gun you down, Scofield!
Where's the aerial and the others?
they're back on the ground refueling.
son of a bitch.
< Manhunt >
sir, media's ready.
I'd like to, uh, talk about John Wilkes Booth for a moment if I could, abraham Lincoln's killer.
12 days, that's how long it took to find him.
in his journal during this period, he wrote that the shadow was his friend, the night his domain.
he acknowledged that whatever neuroses drove the criminal to commit the original crime is compounded, magnified by flight, by the sounds of dogs at his heels.
fear becomes paranoia, paranoia ultimately psychosis.
I bring this up, because, in 140 years, the fundamental mind of the escaped man has not changed.
the escaped man is still human.
he is still afraid, and he will stop at nothing in his attempt at flight.
fortunately for us, while our quarry has shadow and night as his ally, we have something far greater:
television.
I would encourage everyone who is watching, everyone in this country to take a good look at these faces.
these men right here are now the eight-most-wanted men in America.
I thought I thought this out.
you saw all those guys back there?
the key is they're back there, and we're up here.
Yeah, and how long is that going to last?
Yeah, especially since we don't have a pot to piss in thanks to Abruzzi's magically disappearing jet.
Hey, you were never going to be on that plane, brother.
and don't think I don't know where you were going either, Scofield.
where am I going?
Oh, I don't know. Utah?
when were you planning on telling us about the money, man?
what money?
$5 million that westmoreland planted in the desert in Utah.
you don't know what you're talking about.
you wish I didn't know.
wait, wait. What money?
warden?
it's a little early for the FBI to be showing up, don't you think?
look, I get it.
it's still your investigation, but once those criminals cross state lines, it'll become a federal matter.
Yeah, well, that is not going to happen.
I hope you're right.
that's why I was going to suggest that we cut through any interagency politics from the outset.
full transparency.
Absolutely.
good.
then maybe you can tell me about dr. Tancredi.
there's nothing to tell.
from what I'm hearing, she may have abetted the escapees;
opened the door that allowed them to get out.
like I said, there's nothing to tell.
you're not being very transparent, warden.
look, I don't discuss my staff.
maybe you should, because she may be the key to this thing.
we need to speak with her.
right now, Mr. Mahone, she's not going to be talking with anyone.
how are we doing?
well, the ivs are hydrating her.
we got her on a naloxone infusion, half milligram per hour.
what do you think the chances are?
well, we've done everything on our end. It's really up to her.
either she fights and lives, or she quits and dies.
Hey! What do you think...
do whatevething you got to do, man.
Oh, and...
boy...
you call the cops, I will put this thing right here in your eye.
thank you.
structural engineer, huh?
not the kind you'd expect to get that much ink.
not the kind at all.
how long do you think it'd take to get something like that?
hundred hours...
200
tattoo artist who gave it to him must have spent a lot of time on him then.
I'll find out who it was.
Mr. Bellick.
don't talk to me.
fine, but it's going to make collaboration kind of hard.
collaboration?
I got men out here in harm's way, and you're giving press conferences.

it'll bring those men back quicker than bloodhounds will.
we don't need you.

you think they're not just sitting there, waiting for you to come running back home?
what's the matter with you?
what about New York?
what about I my girl's pregnant, bro.
understand your love is your weakness right now, and they know about it.
doesn't mean it has to stop you.
you just got to be smart about it.
get to Oswego.
Oswego was not on the way, snowflake.
it's not where Oswego is.
it's what's in Oswego.
captain, Scofield's credit card transaction history.
spent a lot of money here in Will county before he was incarcerated?
exactly.
he was from Chicago.
why does a guy from Chicago come all the way out here and spend north of eight grand in all these places in little over a month?
car wash, voice mail, storage, car rental...
we got guys looking into it.
good.
captain, what about the FEDs?
should we tell them?
what do you think?
captain Bellick?
we got something.
hunter up by tamarack just ran into five of the cons.
so this is where Scofield lived?
up until about two months ago when he was incarcerated.
mother's dead, father's a deadbeat.
you got nothing in the whole world but your brother.
so you plan.
and you scheme for months...
till you get it right.
every single element.
and then you destroy all the evidence.
I want divers down in the river.
you won't get cell coverage.
we're in the middle of nowhere.
digital carriers don't have cell towers way out here in western montana.
how about shutting up, Terrence?
just trying to save you some effort.
they're like a web, these people.
the harder you struggle, the worse it gets.
sounds to me like a coward trying to justify himself.
if I stay out of the way and stay quiet,
I stay alive.
that's what they said; that's what they told me.
and you're willing to live like this, in a hermetically-sealed box while everything out there goes to hell?
self-preservation is a strong motivator.
so is the truth.
don't.
young woman?
do not don't
how you doing, buddy?
I'm pretty freaked out, that's how I'm doing.
they took your car, didn't they?
1978 grand Cherokee.
which way did they go?
up that way north toward Oswego.
pardon me.
Scofield's paperwork- get it, jimmy.
the credit card stuff.
right here, captain.
of course.
where is he going to put all the crap you need to disappear?
we're going to Oswego, boys.
you have a visitor
thank U.
Thanks.
you look disappointed.
no. I thought you were going to be my father.
you heard from him?
his office.
brought you a change of clothes.
figured, you know...
Thanks.
and your purse.
you left it in the infmary.
I'm in a lot of trouble, I think.
I,
I need to apologize to you.
they threatened my job if I didn't talk, and...
no, no, no, no.
no.
one thing you learn when you're walking the steps is that you never outsource a blame that belongs in your own backyard.
you're not the first correctional worker that fell for a con, trust me.
he never cared.
not one bit.
what are you thinking about?
mistakes.
you had to do it.
not like I did.
I ruined her life.
there's nothing you can do about it now.
that's not true.
you fell for her, huh?
Where's Oswego?
half mile maybe good.
what are you going to do, Terrence, shoot me?
blow my guts all over this house?
then what?
you can't leave, remember?
you kill me, you're stuck with me.
I'm safe here.
you're a prisoner here.
but I'm still breathing.
if I go outside one step,
I won't be.
you look at me...
like I'm the devil.
I gave up my family.
my teeth.
I eat percocet all day just to dull the pain of my miserable existence.
you have no idea what I've been through.
what you've been through?
this isn't about you, Terrence
don't.
Blackfoot Sheriff's department.
hello.
Blackfoot Sheriff's department
my name's Veronica Donovan.
I need you to send a unit to the house at the end of light road as soon as possible.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but are you calling to report a crime?
by the president of the united states.
send the car.
I'm sorry, sir,
I-I don't think I can do this.
there are nerves...
Llook, you need a specialist, okay?
I don't...
you-you need somebody who knows what they're doing.
I don't have the ly of choice here, doctor.
my hand has been in that box for hours now.
it is dying.
sir, I am not capable of doing this.
I only have one hand, but I could stick this in your neck before you get to that door.
now, if that's not incentive enough for you,
I see that you have a Mrs. Gudat out there.
with a name like that in a county like this, old Mrs. Gudat would not be too hard to find now, would she?
fine.
I can promise you nothing.
story of my life.
I'll have to put you under.
do I really look that stupid?
sir, I cannot do a procedure like this without an anesthetic.
I have to cut away dead flesh.
nobody can undergo a procedure like this without an anesthetic!
I ain't nobody.
schweitzer was the plumbing company that made the toilet Scofield took off to get out of his cell.
allen Boltas the fitting.
it's all here, isn't it?
it's amazing.
there a place in the vicinity with that name?
got someone looking into it.
doc's moving on a storage facility in Oswego.
captain, manager says that Scofield's got a lease on unit 164.
it's still active.
we got guys on 8th street, 3rd street, then the alley.
if they're in there, captain, we got 'em boxed.
we push right up the gut, then.
any one of them makes a threatening move, put a hole in 'em.
you got it.
officer...
this is my collar, smart guy.
back the hell off.
close the door.
still nothing on this place?
Nope. They're coming back with nothing.
no place by that name anywhere in this country.
or any other country, for that matter.
let's go.
son of a bitch set us up.
not one word.
officer...
nothing.
Oh.
Oh, that kid's clever.
it's not a place, it's a name.
your pda, you got it?
Yeah.
bring up the census of this county.
far back as it goes.
somebody's going to see us.
keep digging.
we're gonna go to hell, guys.
swear to god, we're gonna go to hell.
help me out.
you are one sick cat, you know that?
what are you looking for?
we got to go to the cemetery.
now.
originally, this was supposed to be a week's worth of clothes for me and Linc.
but, uh, figured you all need just as much help as we do, so...
you're just doing this out of the goodness of your heart, fish?
that's right, John, the heart.
you remember what that is, don't you?
damn, snowflake, this is tight, man.
it's like I said, we got to stop being cons start being civilians.
nice.
trousers are a little bit too short, don't you think?
chop your feet off. You're good at that.
this jacket ain't exactly the best thing, you know what I'm saying?
you want variety, hit target.
what do we got?
money, passports...
pre-paid phone cards.
Archie Ryan? - Did you see mine?
these?
keys to a car that's waiting for us a couple hundred yards from here.
that a two-of-us or five-of-us?
that's a two-of-us.
they know?
not yet.
Guy-guy-guys, we got company.
guys, we got to roll.
how did he know?
we're civilians; remember that.
civilians.
I'm sorry, uh.
do you know what time it is?
no, sorry.
I can't go outside.
they'll kill me as soon as I show my face.
you're wrong about that.
as soon as you show your face, this whole thing is gonna be over.
you can have your life back, Terrence.
promise?
I promise.
hello.
V, it's me.
lync --We're out.
thank god you're okay.
I saw the news. You got to stop.
I need you to turn yourself in.
what?
I found Steadman.
I'm with him now, Linc. He's alive.
you're going to be exonerated.
come in.
what are you talking about, you found Steadman?
Terrence, come on, let's go.
afternoon. -Veronica.
the police are here.
look, Ied you to stay where you are.
ma'am.
I don't want to lose you.
ma'am, put the phone down.
what?
Mr. Steadman, take a few steps back.
Oh, my god.
I thought you knew that all calls to the local station are routed through us.
this is federal land, remember?
and, uh, as for your little toy here, it's contraband.
you gonna tell us how you got it in there?
I brought it when I got here.
whatever for?
to protect myself.
that's what we're here for, remember?
in less than a day, the trail has gone cold in the pursuit of what are now being called...
Yeah, it's fine
stay on top of it, all right?
doc's still doing a sweep of Oswego, but the guys have basically vanished.
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Mr. Lves.
I don't know how you can be so confident.
it's not like these guys left a map where they're going.
actually, that's exactly what they did.
Scofield had the entire thing on his body
how to get out of that prison, how to disappear afterward.
it's all there.
I promise you that it's only a matter of time before we know everything that is in Scofield's head
where he plans to run to, how he plans to get there.
so when the time comes that he does get there, we'll be waiting for him.
this is not your island.
this is our island.
they've attacked us, sabotaged us, abducted us, murdered us.
we're not the only people on this island, and we all know it!
they came the first night, took three of us, then they came back and took nine more.
they're smart, and they're animals.
you're coming with us.
I burnt my hand...and my muffins.
still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet?
it's a work in progress.
it's not even literature. It's popcorn.
and why isn't it literature, adam?
I'm dying to know.
there's no metaphor.
it's by the numbers, religious hokum-pokum.
no metaphor? It's science fiction.
now I know why Ben isn't here.
excuse me?
I know the host picks the book, but seriously, Julie, he wouldn't read this in the damned bathroom.
well, Adam, I am the host, and I do pick the book, and this is my favorite book, so I am absolutely thrilled that you can't stand it.
silly me for sinking so low as to select something that Ben wouldn't like.
here I am, thinking that free will still actually exists on...
in the doorway.
you see where the tail landed?
Yeah, probably in the water.
you run, you can make that shore in an hour.
Ethan, get up there to that fuselage.
there may actually be survivors, and you're one of them.
a passenger--you're in shock.
come up with an adequate story if they ask.
stay quiet if they don't.
listen. Learn. Don't get involved.
I want lists in three days.
go.
so I guess I'm out of the book club.
hey can you hear me?!
rise and shine, Kate.
where am I?
you don't really think I'm going to answer that, do you?
where are Sawyer and Jack?
I'll tell you what.
why don't you just take a nice hot shower?
wake yourself up.
wash the day off you and start fresh.
it's a nice clean towel, shampoo, soap-- I'm not showering in front of you.
you're not my type.
where are we?
who the hell are you?
Oh, you ain't gonna talk to me?
what, you got more important things to do?
warning.
warning.
I wouldn't do that.
I want your advice, I'll ask for it.
son of a bitch!
told you.
stop that.
Hi, Jack.
I'm Juliet.
Hi. Yes?
uh, I'm Jack Shephard.
I'm here for the-- where's your lawyer?
you look pretty.
Where's your lawyer?
I fired him.
I'm sorry...for--for pushing us to this place.
I...
I know that I
excuse me. I'm sorry.
yeah?
Oh, not yet.
he--he just got here.
Oh, I'll call you when I get out.
Jack, I'm gonna say this as simply as I can-- What's his name?
Jack, stop it. I'm not gonna stop it.
I'm gonna keep asking you that until you tell me.
well, I don't ask you what you're doing with your-- just tell me what his name is.
I wanna know who he is.
look, you can have everything-- the cars, the house.
I don't care. I just...
I just wanna know the name of the man that is with my wife.
can you hear me in there?
is that a yes?
where are my friends?
come down from the table first.
you want me to come down, come in here and get me down.
if you wanna talk, I'm happy-- tell me where my friends are!
I will...if you let go of the chain.
you think I'm stupid?!
I don't think you're stupid, Jack.
I think you're stubborn.
where are my clothes?!
wear this come on, Kate.
he's waiting.
sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to put those on, Kate.
and if I don't?
then you don't get any coffee.
a little tighter.
please?
what did you do with Sawyer and Jack?
now why Sawyer?
why Sawyer what?
he's the first one you asked about-- "What did you do with Sawyer and Jack?"
you don't know me.
of course I don't.
I want my clothes back.
we burned them.
why did you bring me here?
why did you make me put on this dress?
why are you feeding me breakfast?
I brought you here so you'd look out at the water and feel comforted that your friends were looking out at the same ocean.
I gave you the dress so you'd feel like a lady, and I wanted you to eat your food with a real live fork and feel civilized.
I did all those things so that you'd have something nice to hold on to.
because, Kate...
the next two weeks are going to be very unpleasant.
Yeah, hi.
I met a woman on the train--sarah-- and, uh, she dropped her cell phone, and I don't even know her last name, but your number was in her phone, so I was just wondering...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Forget it.
just give me a minute, dad.
I asked you to give mea minute here.
what's this?
why are you dialing all the numbers on sarah's cell phone?
because one of them is him.
you gotta stop this, Jack.
it's over.
not until I know his name, where he works, where he lives.
when they first kissed.
I wanna know what it is about him.
Mrs. Owens, call the operator.
Mrs. Owens, call the operator, please.
why is Sarah calling you, dad?
I think it's time that you let this go.
why is she calling you?
because she was afraid...for you. dad...
I wanna know exactly why the hell she would call you.
she could see tha tyou were slipping.
you were losing your grip. My grip is not the problem here.
which is exactly what's happening here.
Jack! Come
I think I know a little something about being obsessive.
no, being a drunk is not obsessive.
let it go, Jack.
What?!
if you're trying to talk to me, I can't hear you!
let it go, jack.
I know you're hungry.
I brought this for you.
this is how it will work.
you sit there, across from the door, back against the wall.
I open the door and leave the tray.
can I trust you to do that, Jack?
I don't want your food.
well, it's a delicious sandwich
I want you to tell the guy who's trying to talk to me through that intercom that he can give it up!
maybe you're hungrier than you think.
that intercom hasn't worked in years.
what's that for?
the button--what it's for?
it's for emergencies.
who's watching me?
are you going to sit against the wall so I can open the door?
it's...just off the frying pan.
you can have it.
what do you do, Jack?
what's your profession?
I'm a repo man.
you know, when people don't pay their bills, I go in for the bank, and I collect their possessions.
I'm a people person, so I really love it.
are you married?
no.
I never saw the point.
what about you?
what's your job, besides making sandwiches?
Oh, I didn't make it.
I just put the toothpicks in.
when your plane crashed, where were you flying from?
Sydney.
what were you doing there?
I was bringing my father home.
why would you go all the way to Australia just to-- because he was dead.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you are.
Thanks.
you can trust me, Jack.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
what the hell is going on here?
how long would it take to get to your camp?
what, you're talking to me now, chachi?
from where they got you, how long a walk was it-- day? Two days?
Hey, what are the people like--from your plane?
Oh, they're just awesome.
last one of you boys came for a visit got tortured by our iraqi.
he tortured me, too.
well, hell, he don't know any better.
subject escape.
subject escape.
subject escape.
how'd you get out of there?
subject escape.
subject escape.
you run that way.
hold on-- you run that way!
subject escape.
subject escape.
subject escape.
say it.
say it, karl.
I'm...Sorry.
sorry I involved you in my breakout attempt.
the drugs we gave you when we brought you here have a fairly serious side effect--dehydration.
your head is probably sore.
your throat is raw, and if you don't eat or drink something soon, you're going to start hallucinating.
so you're a doctor, huh?
no.
I'm a repo woman.
no strings attached.
you don't have to answer any questions.
you don't have to do anything but sit with your back upagainst the far wall.
let me open that door, put the plate down and leave.
I know it feels like you're giving up, like you're losing if you do anything that I ask you to.
but you're not.
you need to eat.
what do you say?
thank you, Jack.
let's take out the epidural catheter and get him started on a P.C.A.
excuse me just a second.
you sure he's ready toself-administer his pain meds?
Hello?
Dr. Shephard?
give me your cell phone.
what? I wanna see it. Now.
look where you are, Jack.
just look around you, please.
okay?
give me the phone.
this is not the place for this.
you must be jack.
why don't you, uh, grab a chair and join us?
you...
you know me?
Yes.
your father's told us all about you.
Oh, yeah? What's he told you about me?
What'd you tell 'em about me, dad-- that your--your son never really had it?
not like the old man.
I didn't have the will to make it work-- my--my life, my job, my marriage?
What'd you tell 'em about my marriage, dad?!
you know how he manages his marriage?
a bottle of scotch every night before dinner.
your father has been sober 50 days now.
we're very proud of that.
wow, dad.
I wonder what--what helped you turn that corner?
you think maybe it was, uh, a new lady friend?
you think maybe that's what it was-- I will not let you talk to me
I will not let you sleep with my wife.
wow, Jack.
Jack, I'm your father.
Jack, please, just let it go!
which way out?
don't do this, Jack.
don't.
don't.
open the door. No, I can't. I can't, Jack.
I do that, we die. You're lying to me.
I'm not. I'm not.
open the door! I can't! I swear I can't!
she's telling the truth, Jack.
I swear to god...
I will kill her.
okay.
have her open the door, and she dies anyway.
we all do.
over here!
the button!
What?! The yellow button! The button!
warning.
gotcha, Doc Brown!
reward!
reward!
Oh, come on.
unbelievable.
keep movin'.
stick your hands out through the bars. I'll take off your cuffs.
they scratched you up pretty bad, didn't they?
I'll bring you some antiseptic later.
how about you bring me an ottoman?
while you're at it, I could use a blow-dry.
you got yourself a fish biscuit.
how'd you do that?
I figured out your complicated gizmos, that's how.
only took the bears two hours.
how many of 'em were there?
you okay, freckles?
Yeah.
you?
just swell.
I requested that cage, but whatever.
nice dress.
they made me wear it.
are you hungry?
it's an aquarium.
excuse me?
this thing's for what...sharks?
dolphins, too.
we're underwater, aren't we?
Yes.
is this one of their...
Stations-- the--the dharma initiative?
they called it the hydra.
so you people are just...
whatever's leftover of them?
well, that was a long time ago.
it doesn't matter...
who we were.
it only matters who we are.
we know exactly you who are, Jack Shephard.
you don't know anything about me.
we know that you're a spinal surgeon based out of st. Sebastian's hospital in Los Angeles.
I know that you went to Columbia, and you graduated school a year faster than anyone else.
I know that you were married only once and that you contested the divorce.
I know your father died in Sydney.
I know this because I have a copy of his autopsy report.
how...
how did you get-- We got it.
what is that?
this, Jack...
is your life.
do you...
is it just about me, or is it about my family, too? My...
my friends?
it's pretty much about everything.
do you know about my...
about my ex-wife?
Yes, Jack.
we know all about her.
what would you like to find out?
get it ready for lockdown.
Shephard, someone posted your bail.
how'd you, uh...
your dad told me you were here.
I called you a cab.
so, um...
good-bye.
what?
is that him?
what difference does it make? It just does.
it's not gonna change anything. Look, I wanna know!
I need to know who he is.
it doesn't matter who he is.
it just matters who you're not.
your father...
when he called me...to help you...
he was so drunk, I could hardly understand him.
look at the bright side.
now you have something to fix.
what would you like to find out?
is she...
is she happy?
Yes, Jack.
she's very happy.
now I'd like to bring you some food and water, but this time I need to know that you'll behave.
can I trust you, Jack?
put your back against the wall, please.
good work, Juliet.
thank you, Ben.
I got nothing against you, kid.
what are you doing, man?
but they do.
your pal manche told me all about your little treasure hunt for westmoreland's stash.
we're going to Utah.
fooled you.
hands behind your back.
make yourself at home. Sure.
your father got a call from the white house.
they withdrew his nomination.
according to them, his confirmation was going to be a problem.
my father is not a suicidal man.
governor Tancredi, not part of our plan.
anyone who knows anything has got to be dealt with.
if someone's a liability, they go.
Tancredi was becoming a liability.
so was his daughter.
wait, what?
Burrows is scheduled to be released from the klipton detention center in kingman, arizona tomorrow morning.
LJ is out there; I'm going to get him.
take care.
God bless you and your wrinkled old sack.
it's all here.
Where's Sucre?
drop the bag.
no one's going anywhere.
what the hell are you doing, man?
whatever it is you want... I want the money, all of it.
what, are you robbing us?
the money was never yours to begin with.
this is about business.
$5 million worth of business.
so this is how it's going to go down, huh?
after everything.
once a thief, always a thief.
you just figuring that out?
the backpack.
now!
don't do this, buddy.
yo, take a look around you, Papi.
it's three of us, it's one of you; you are outnumbered, man, and we will come after you.
it'll be the last thing you do, my brother.
what, are you going to shoot at all of us?
probably not.
but I will get two.
now...
which two is it going to be?
that's what I thought.
Adios, amigos.
I don't believe this.
we have come all this way and done all of this work.
thought you was compadres, tattoo?
so what are we going to do now, man?
the police are going to be here any second.
ain't no way I'm letting that-that dunderpate ride off with five...
it's your choice.
it's all right.
all right, I'm going to give you this, and, uh...
you should be able to cut yourself free in about an hour.
so what's the plan, man?
well, you can do what you want.
I let that psychopath t-bag loose once.
I'm not going to do it again.
make a nice little present for the police when they get here.
where is he?
I don't know, man, look, I got to, I got to go.
uh, good luck.
they're going to get you.
ms. Tancredi.
I didn't mean to startle you.
what the hell are you doing in my house?
no reason to be frightened.
I used to work with your father.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
my father didn't commit suicide.
what are you doing?
making sure it doesn't look like I did!
well, then.
what if they don't find her?
in an apparent attempt to avoid jail time, the governor's daughter skips bail and disappears.
we're talking about your last minutes, Ms. Tancredi.
please don't do this.
that stuff on that table is premium.
it's grade "A."
do yourself a favor, go out on a high.
look, I'm begging you here.
one last ride.
Oh, god!
Adios, amigos, huh?
what?
too much?
you were great.
this thing is freaking heavy, dude.
won't be so bad after we split it up.
three ways: Me, you and linc. Four.
we're going to send a share to charles's daughter, with her father's love, just like we promised.
what about c-note?
I feel kind of bad about the whole thing.
there's no way to know if we could trust him.
once we get down to panama, we'll send something up to his family, make sure he's taken care of.
five million dollars.
I can't believe I'm going to be...
where the hell is the money?
where the hell is the money?
the backpack...
now!
Kingman, Arizona mr. Burrows?
merry christmas from the state.
here's a list of options available to you.

any questions you might have about your immediate future?
no.
well, the number on there is toll-free.
if you encounter any problems, you can call there 24-7.
Thanks.
wait a second. You know what?
why don't you tell me where you need to go, and I'll make sure you get there.

thank you.
kid didn't bite.
he's on foot. All right.
have your men follow. Remember, it's the father we want.
we can't go back.
you said it, without the money, we're screwed.
we can't... just let me think.
maybe it's still back... just let me think! Let me think.
maybe it's still back at the house.
the money's not back at the house unless t-bag is.
he must've switched the packs.
wh-what do we do...
what do we do now?
we still got the five grand we took when we pocketed the money.
it's not gonna be five million, but it might be enough to get us where we're going.
all units be advised.
escaped convicts from fox river have been positively id'd at 1131 monterey lane.
we have dogs being dispatched to the location.
I want every road in or out of town blocked off.
I don't care if it's on wheels, rails or hooves.
I want it stopped and searched.
I thought you said we would have a head start.
it was the gunshot, buddy.
one of the neighbors must've heard.
how fast can that thing go?
I don't know. Both of us, it could probably...
we're never gonna get out of here on the roads.
we need to find another way.
Chicago, Illinois FBI Filed Office
he's in your office.
I can't believe they're calling me back here when my escapees are out there.
I want to know who this guy is.
said his name was Sullins.
son of a bitch.
let me know if anything breaks on the convicts.
Alex. Thanks for coming in.
you want to tell me why internal affairs is pulling me out of the field in the middle of a manhunt?
it's been a while since we've had a sit-down, hasn't it?
not since the Shales escape, am I right?
Yeah, yeah. What's going on, Richard?
well...
that's precisely what I'm here to find out.
and you're not getting out of here until I do.
lyman, Wyoming
Oh, my god. Civilization.
what can I get for you boys?
you tell me.
two waters, then.
and the use of your phone, if you'd be so kind.
don't worry, it's a local call.
first thing I do, we get home: Clean underwear.
then what?
I guess go back to that liquor store, beg for my job back.
we had it.
we were so close.
I can still taste that money right there in the back of my throat.
well, nothing that a couple of keystones, a hungry man salisbury steak dinner and a night in front of the tv won't take care of.
Hey, mom, it's Brad.
Hey, listen, me and roy, we ran into some car trouble and...
we were wondering if you could come pick us up.
I don't know, hold on.
what the hell town is this?
thought you said this was a local call.
Hey, bradley, check this out. Wait, mom.
these individuals were reportedly the prisoners who escaped from the fox river penitentiary in illinois just a couple of days ago.
what were they doing all the way out here in Tooele, Utah?
well, Jeanette Owens, whose garage they dug up, has her own theory.
they pretended that they were some kind of workers from the power company, and that they had made a mistake and they'd have to do some digging.
Hey, mom, on second thought, uh, can you wire us some extra scratch?
turns out, we ain't done yet.
hello.
Bruce, I need your help.
Bruce, my father didn't commit suicide, okay?
okay, just calm down. Where are you?
he was looking into the burrows case and I think that he found something that they didn't want him to know.
and now, I think that they think that I know it, too.
all right, I want you to listen to me.
I'm gonna send someone over to pick you up.
I'll bring you back here, and we'll sort all of this out, I promise.
just tell me where you are.
uh, I don't know, I'm at a pay phone on...
third and harper.
do you have your cell in case I need to reach you?
uh, I do, but I-I thought it would be tapped.
I don't know.
all right, someone's on their way.
just stay right where you are.
thank you.
I'll give you 80 bucks for them.
come on, man, they're worth...
worth a lot more to the person they actually belong to.
these are ladies clubs, doctor.
I'm guessing they're hotter than a monkey's jockstrap.
80 bucks.
throw in the cooler, and you got a deal.
we got to lose the bike.
no way.
the roads are sealed.
it's the only way we're gonna make it out of here.
I can't, bro. I promised petey...
you're not getting that thing across the river.
and every minute we spend trying is a minute we don't have, okay?
I'm sorry.
we got to move.
I've heard about these kinds of places.
they got leeches, you know.
I'll take the leeches in here over the handcuffs back there.
I don't know, papi.
sort of depends on where the leech leeches, you know what I'm saying?
stop kidding around.
are you all right, buddy?
I can't...I can't move!
you feel like you broke anything?
no, I don't think so.
can you get it? Can you get it off me?
this thing's not going anywhere.
I'm gonna check your foot.
I'm sorry, buddy.
it's stuck.
you, call 911.
Kelli, my name is Sara. I'm a doctor.
you're gonna be okay. Can you hear me?
you'll be all right. Take some deep breaths and...
it's gonna be okay, right?
I mean, if you can get eight people out of prison, you can get my puerto rican ass out of this, right?
can't you?
come on!
damn it!
do you hear that?
I know that sound.
there's a dam up river.
it's a signal.
it means they're opening the locks.
that means the water level's gonna rise, and when it does, the log will just float right off.
yeah?
canine units at the scene have multiple scents and are spreading out into the field.
trail's fresh. These guys can't have gotten very far.
there were six cons back at that house.
they'll be tracking us in every direction.
it'll take an hour just to make it over this far, and by that time, the water level will rise, we'll be long gone.
are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
I'm sure.
ask any of the 20 cops there, John Abruzzi was armed.
John Abruzzi drew his weapon...
he never should have been allowed to get that far.
Richard, let's be clear.
if you knew how things needed to be handled in a manhunt, you'd be out there running one instead of hamstringing the men that are.
the FBI's primary objective in investigating fugitive matters is to affect the swift location and capture of the fugitives.
you have two dead bodies, Alex.
I've got two dead felons, richard.
now, maybe that doesn't play well from a public relations standpoint, but from a public safety standpoint, Abruzzi and Apolskis were by the book.
shooting of an unarmed kid at point-blank range is by the book?
come on.
incident report, David "Tweener" Apolskis.
you know, I'm curious, was he cuffed during transport?
says in here he somehow managed to grab your primary weapon.
you carry that in a shoulder holster? Hip.
left, right? Right, left?
left. Left.
I'm sorry, I get confused sometimes.
so just so I've got this right, you were driving along alone with a cuffed prisoner, and somehow he reaches forward across your chest and grabs your weapon.
it's too bad you didn't react that quickly with Apolskis.
maybe he'd still be alive.
there's a plan to make all of this right
what does an origami bird have to do with any of this?
michael Scofield sent it to her.
and since your brilliant plan to eliminate Sara Tancredi from the equation failed so completely
I wouldn't say it failed completely at all. There's a dead woman in a phone booth.
civilian.
a certain number of bodies you can sweep under the rug.
president's rug is getting so full, you can hardly stand on it.
so what do you suggest we should do?
you ever go fishing, Bill? Just make your point.
there's two ways to catch a fish.
you cast out a big net and hope you get what you're looking for.
or you choose the right bait and guarantee that you do.
it's a simple strategy, plays across the board.
LJ will lead us to burrows.
Sara will lead us to scofield.
and how do you intend to follow Sara, when the only lead you've got is an origami bird with an out of service phone number?
maybe it's not a phone number.
what do you have?
junior's on the move, but still no sign of Burrows.
sir, the guy's in hiding, maybe he doesn't even know his kid's out.
the cop that was held hostage in Utah has Burrows splitting off from the rest of the group just after word of lj's release hit the wire.
he knows.
now if we want to know for sure if he's there, we need to do something to draw him out.
Hey, you mind sparing some change?
no.
come on.
no, I'm all tapped out. You got something.
I'll take whatever you got.
look, seriously, I just got out of lock-up.
sorry.
I see, you think you're better than me, huh?
I don't think I'm better than you.
yo, where you running, little man?
I'm not running anywhere.
this isn't how it's supposed to go.
the whole reason I went along with the break was to have a life with Maricruz and my baby.
and now what?
get some two-bit job?
always be looking over my shoulder?
what kind of life is that?
you can come with me and linc.
to panama.
start over.
the longer you stay here, the more chance there is you'll never make it to Panama.
you've got other people to think about.
your brother, your nephew.
she's meeting you down there, isn't she?
I don't know.
we never talked about it.
but you're hoping.
just give it a rest, will you.
the dogs are locked in. We've got two trails merging.
they were definitely here.
they've headed east towards drucker ranch. They've gone off-road.
any additional units, we need to setup a one-mile perimeter and then start closing in.
it's getting deeper.
so how come this freaking thing ain't moving yet?
let me check you all right?
Hey, Michael...
I understand if you have to keep going, you know.
don't say that. I'm not going anywhere.
no, but, look, just think about it. You know, if I leave you drown.
no, I know, but just...
the water level's getting higher, Sucre.
how many seconds can you hold your breath?
that's how long you've got to live if I take off.
how long do you have if you stay?
how long till the dogs lead the cops here?
what you're suggesting is not an option.
look, I ain't trying to be a hero or nothing.
we both know there are only two things that can happen now.
leave me here...
or we both get caught.
I know we said not to use this number, but I just needed to know you were okay.
my driver said he went to pick you up and the place was a crime scene.
Yeah, the woman that he saw, the woman by the pay phone, that was supposed to be me.
and-and I had to leave her there. I didn't know what to do.
Bruce, who are these people?
they knew exactly where I was going to be standing.
they knew where I was going to be...
it was you.
what are you talking about, Sara?
I just need to know where you are. Oh, my god.
city memorial hospital emergency
excuse me, we'd like to check on a friend of ours, LJ Burrows?
he's getting some stitches.
we just want to make sure he's all right.
and you can see him when he's through.
it's policy.
you don't get it.
I get that that kid defended himself.
you going to tell us why you attacked him in the first place?
I told you man.
I know, some guy paid you. Some guy paid me to do it.
excuse me. FBI.
what do you mean somebody paid you?
what the hell does it sound like, man?
some dude gave me 50 bucks to give the kid a beat down.
it's Burrows. He's here.
how you feeling, son?
dad?
we got to move.
well, there's not much you can do, you know.
excuse me, ladies.
I need to ask you a few questions.
I'm on the, uh, follow-up investigation team.
excuse me.
uh, we're just curious.
did you see if the convicts actually found what they were digging for?
no. But sure sounded like they did.
the spaniard, he took off with one of my daughter's camping packs and he left the other ones in a real tizzy.
sounded like he screwed 'em over something fierce.
and-and they just let him leave?
well, they weren't happy about it, but, yeah.
he took off on his motorbike, and then they left a few minutes later.
together? No.
the pretty one and the black fellow, they left first, and then that dirty southerner...
he snuck out the back.
but he was moving kind of slow, you know, the weight of that backpack and that disability that...
wait a minute, he had a backpack, too?
Yes.
he came back in and slipped this into my brassiere on his way out.
he said it was to cover the damages.
um, we're going to need to keep this as evidence.
thank you for your time.
get the car.
seven, three, six, space.
three, three, nine, space.
and what exactly are you looking for?
a pattern.
a code.
anything.
result for number: 7363398687
what? What are you trying to tell me, Michael?
they say...
people come into your life for a reason.
maybe my reason was to help you get out of fox river.
you know, to help you save your brother.
no.
it's okay, papi.
let me go.
we're a quarter mile up the river below the dam.
it's now or never, Michael.
I want you to hold your breath. Okay?
Why? Just do it.
I'll be right back, I promise.
what the hell are you doing?
all units to the river.
I want you to go under.
and then stick your arm up, above the water, high.
all right.
and then when you start running out of air, wave it back and forth so I can see it.
and I'll come back and get you. Okay?
all right, give me your hand.
come on.
come on!
talk to me.
well, there is one possibility, but it's almost too rudimentary.
we know we're not looking at a phone number, but maybe we're not looking at numbers at all.
what's important are the letter that correspond to that number.
three dots, third letter
three possibilities per number.
that's thousands of letter combinations.
but only one of them's going to be right.
rendezvous pendextoup
she was right.
#1799 a real beauty
Hey.
what are you in the market for?
four wheels and a gas pedal.
Hey, Petey. Uh, it's me.
uh, listen, I-I got something to tell you.
Yeah, well, I was wondering when you were gonna call.
Yeah, um, a-a lot has come down since we last talked, and, uh...
gee, I know, I heard.
you ruined it.
Yeah.
you heard already?
well, brother, everybody's heard, man, and let me tell you something, man.
Hector is pissed.
what does hector have to do with it?
it was his wedding.
wait, man.
what are you talking about? Your bike.
what are you talking about? The wedding.
what about the wedding?
well, you know the part where, uh, you say,"I do"?
Maricruz said,"I don't."
she did?
left homeboy standing at the altar holding his spam in his hand, if you know what I'm saying.
what were you telling me about my bike?
all right.
I'll go get your keys.
I got a couple stops to make.
first is this place called Blanding.
then we'll meet up with Lincoln in a couple days.
I can't go.
she said no, papi.
Maricruz told that son of a...
she told him no.
can you believe that?
that's great. I know.
now, I just...
no. Go on. Get your girl.
what about Panama? We said that we were gonna...
some other time. Panama's not going to go anywhere.
this is, uh, in case you run into trouble down the road.
in the river...
I told you to leave me behind.
Yeah, well, I tried, but, uh, then I got tangled up in the rope, so...
okay, here you go.
Thanks, and, uh, we'll need another car.
do you really think the diaper sniper got all of it?
only one way to find out.
if you were bagwell, and you just got your hands on $5 million, where would you go?
you think you're the only one who feels betrayed?
I'm gonna get out of here some day.
and when I do, don't think I won't remember what your front steps look like.
let me get this straight.
you-you paid that meth-head to whoop my ass?
Yup.
feds were waiting for me to come get you. It was the only way.
it worked, didn't it?
Yeah, it got me four stitches.
adds character.
here, take that.
there's some ice in there. Put it on the eye.
keep the swelling down.
I've been in a few fights in my day, too.
too many.
rendez vous sundown/hot
there's one more.
clean it.
every surface, like she never came home.
you know, waiting for your flight from Utah, I had a little extra time for due diligence, so I decided to dig a little deeper on your history, or rather lack of one.
starts off simple enough.
poor family. Mom leaves, cites spousal abuse.
somehow your dad holds onto custody, and by the look of these pediatric meds, he beats you like a harp seal for the next four years.
big shock-- poor, abused kid, not a lot of options-- he joins the military.
will there be any actual questions, or is this just a show-and-tell?
okay, I got one.
how does a guy go from infantry grunt with less than stellar marks to the gulf 1, special ops, to the federal bureau of investigations, leading the largest manhunt this country's ever seen?
I have all these dots.
and there's just no way to connect them.
looks like you need to work on your clearance level...Dick.
or maybe I just work on you.
you want to do this?
I will chain you to this desk until I get some answers I cannot fertilize my lawn with.
you sure you want to do this?
I know what they tell you to do overseas, Alex, and let me make it perfectly clear-- we do not do it on American soil.
sir, uh, there's a phone call for you.
I'll take it later.
uh, sir, you're gonna want to take this now.
Yeah.
Yes, sir.
I, uh...
I'm with him now.
Yes, sir.
okay.
where you going, Rick?
I thought we were really starting to get somewhere.
let's go.
you got something for me?
open it.
the numbers correlate to the letters on a phone.
only on this one, none of the possible combinations make sense.
we think it's a location, a rendezvous point for Michael Scofield.
you find it, you find him.
you know, you could have gotten me out of there sooner.
you know, even we have to go through certain channels to make things appear on the up-and-up.
you know all about that, don't you, Alex?
keeping up appearances.
good.
I was just making sure that we're still clear on the directive of this manhunt.
you know, I understand the, uh, reasoning behind Burrows and Scofield, but these other men-- criminals that they may be
there's nothing in their profiles to suggest... you've been hired to do a job.
the reasoning does not concern you.
don't ask any questions about us, and maybe we'll continue to make sure no one asks any questions about you.
are we clear?
they all die.
they all die.
Sona's a one-way street.
what goes in... never comes out.
they got me and Sara.
LJ and Sara will be traded for Whistler.
are we clear?
I'll tell you the plan when you tell me who you are.
I'm a fisherman.
Really?
my life is in your hands.
how's Lj? How's Sara?
she's dead, Michael.
I lied to you.
I'm James Whistler's girlfriend
you are breaking out of this prison, Mr. Scofield, and you're taking me with you.
four more days.
if I'm out of here by then, I can still do it.
there have been two escape attempts in the past two days.
say good-bye to sona, Mr. Scofield.
right there, leave us
my predecessor, Colonel Escamilla, wasn't an effective leader.
he's been replaced.
I am General Zavala.
sit.
a drink of water?
with all due respect, general, I had nothing to do with what happened here today.
I always conduct a thorough investigation, and there are too many unanswered questions here.
it is my job to find those answers.
if you help me do my job, I'll help you.
the helicopters.
you alone couldn't be responsible for that.
you certainly weren't flying a helicopter, were you? - No.
who was? - I don't know.
but you know who sent them. - No.
again, be advised-- telling the truth is in your best interest.
I am.
let's go for a walk.
I understand your fears, but the Republic of Panama cannot allow this sort of activity.
if you wish to talk, now is the time.
I would... if there was anything left to say.
then you give me no choice.
this way
this isn't good.
they're putting him in the hot box.
things are gonna get much harder for you.
there's no way to win.
you must cooperate.
confess to this escape and face your punishment by law, or face a far greater punishment in the panama sun.
it's up to you.
he's done.
he's finished.
I hope my brother's all right.
does it hurt?
it's fine.
I'm gonna get to the prison.
I was watching the news in the waiting room.
they identified a few bodies, but... it wasn't them.
I'll find out when I get there.
you want to come?
I don't, I don't know.
after everything that's happened, I don't know what to think anymore.
what more is there to think about?
James has an answer for everything, and nothing ever makes sense.
you need to stop asking questions and just look at the facts.
I wanted to believe everything he was saying, and I still want him to get out.
I want him out as well.
trust me, I've been working on this every single day.
lincoln, I really appreciate everything you have done.
you saved my life.
you didn't have to help me like that.
Yeah. I did.
get in the car.
come on
everywhere I go, there you are.
go home, Sofia.
part of me wanted to drive right past this gate, Alex.
you don't deserve to be here.
actually, if you take all things into consideration... I do.
thank you.
wait.
don't.
my father worked in a mine for 30 years, he took this into work with him every day.
kept him safe till the day he retired.
then he gave it to me.
I can't take this.
give it back when you get out.
take care of yourself, Alex.
Yeah.
what? You ain't got the guts to do it yourself?
Hey.
this is for you, so shut up before I change my mind.
after yesterday, you may be doubting my ability to make good on our agreement.
I need to keep you motivated.
you have one minute.
dad!
LJ. Lj, thank god you're alive.
no, forget about it. There's nothing you can do.
there's always something. - No, dad.
these guys are thorough.
they follow you everywhere.
trust me.
that bitch is crazy.
she cut Sara's head off.
I was there.
I closed my eyes, but I heard it.
you listen to me.
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, all right?
the next time you see me, don't take your eyes off me.
I'll tell you what to do. All right?
minute's up.
me and your uncle, we know what we're doing.
we're gonna get you out of this.
I love you. - I love you, dad.
looks like things didn't go so well.
you should be gone.
so should you.
what happened?
it's still happening.
I feel bad for Michael, but we have a way without him.
you should get some rest.
what's the way?
I'll rest. I'll rest. I'll rest when I'm out.
I won't go without you.
you have my word.
now get some rest.
you see Scofield out in that redneck sauna?
let's see if he has the tattoo to get out of that one.
you were in on it, right?
I see you guys lurking around Lechero.
Scofield's gotta have a plan to escape.
if so, I know none of it.
Yeah, I bet you don't.
too many cocktails out on the lido deck.
here comes trouble.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.
you heard what I said.
I told you to do something.
now do it.
cleaning up chunks ain't in my job description anymore.
Oh, things changed.
you see, you answer to us now.
Hey, caveman, you don't scare me.
go bug someone else.
what are you doing here?
I have a special delivery.
I need to get it in real quick.
how much?
I gave you ten grand.
ten grand was the last one. How much for this one?
no grand.
then no thanks.
I think you might want to reconsider
take this water to the prisoner.
why should I? He doesn't deserve it.
I'll do it.
Hi, brother.
remember me?
this isn't gonna work.
come on, papi, drink this.
don't let anything happen to Lj, okay?
it's okay.
he's doing much better than you.
come on. Drink this. You need it.
I'm sorry about Sara.
I'm gonna try to sneak more into the prison next time, okay?
I want you to quit.
I can't.
we all have to quit sometime.
no, Michael.
you're here in a chicken coop-- you need all the help you can get.
don't need your help. Just go, and don't look back.
not after everything you've done for me.
go
so you tried to catch a flight out of here yesterday?
I had to do what I had to do.
Yeah, but you went back on our deal.
I was saving my own ass.
I'm sure you're familiar with the strategy.
now, you watch it.
I'm still boss here.
who cares about who's boss?
do you want to get out of here, or do you want to keep talking about it?
it's okay.
we just need to brace it.
no. We need the engineer.
move it.
let's get out of here before sammy gets back.
98 degrees in the shade, 125 in the box.
let's go inside.
we'll have a chat in the air conditioning.
tomorrow is going to be hotter, the next day, even hotter.
the day after that, you'll be dead.
you don't understand.
if I thought you could help me...
I can.
you're unaware of the influence I have in this province.
you'd rather I be your ally than your enemy, wouldn't you?
you don't know these people.
we can't stop them-- not you, not me.
there was a man-- a drug kingpin-- the most powerful man in Panama.
a ruthless killer with an army of thugs and thieves behind him.
he killed judges and policemen, anyone who stood in his way.
they said he couldn't be stopped either, but now Lechero is in prison, and I'm in power.
I decide whose life is at stake, and right now, it is yours.
from the moment I got here...
I've been planning my escape.
he's talking.
how do you know?
you can't get out of the box any other way.
the people who sent the helicopters, they're the same people who framed my brother back in the U. S.
the same people who wanted me here in sona.
in order for you to break out another inmate?
Yes.
who are these people?
I don't know, but they have my brother's son.
they like to keep collateral.
I could be putting his life in danger as we speak.
if what you told me is true...
...you would be saving him.
I would call my troops and order a search for the boy immediately.
but this story... it's fiction.
it's true.
it's what you wanted. It's the only thing I have left to give.
please.
his name is Lj.
he's only 16 years old.
what's that smell?
Armandos.
these things cost money.
somebody gave them to me- I don't even smoke those things.
who?
this guy I ran some stuff into the prison for, man.
you ran some stuff into the prison? Like what? Drugs?
I don't know. Who cares? He paid me.
you should have quit that job, I...
I know, okay? I need some cash for my kid.
Maricruz doesn't have insurance, all right?
listen. I... I just saw Michael.
he's in solitary confinement.
what?
they put him in a box out in the middle of the yard, all by himself.
he can't do anything.
it's going to be okay.
it's not going to be okay.
I don't know what to do, man.
everything's just fallen apart.
what you lookin' at?
the view.
I can't help but notice you and Lechero made friends.
he's been hanging out with a lot of white boys lately.
got a problem with that?
no. But sammy does.
see, I've been looking close, like I always do.
and I know you all would be a lot better off if sammy were no longer around.
wouldn't have to worry about his snout poking in your business.
and you're suggesting...?
you and I both know it needs to happen.
there aren't many men in Sona who would take out Sammy.
I have one particular man in mind.
a man who owes me.
but if I pull through, I'm in the club, guaranteed.
you're gonna see to it.
I assume you have the power to make this deal.
I do. Agreed.
right.
well. Thank you, sir.
look, I've been thinking about what you told me and, uh... but I can't quit my job.
do whatever you want to do.
well, I would if you could kick me a few bucks, you know.
are we gonna do this again? I told you.
I don't have any cash.
what do you expect me to do?
do whatever you want.
you could use my help, right?
you're gonna start charging me now for your friendship?
I got a kion the way!
and I got a kid I may never see again.
Yeah, get me Gretchen.
much to my surprise, there seems to be some degree of truth to your tale.
everything I told you is true.
that's for me to determine.
what more can I say?
this inmate.
the one who you've been sent to free.
he should be able to verify what you've told me.
he should but... I don't know if he will.
tell me his name.
these people won't hesitate to kill my nephew.
I need to know you're gonna do everything you can to find him.
I will, but I need a name.
I need your word.
you have it.
I'll find the boy.
now, the name.
Hi.
what's wrong?
why don't you tell me?
I went to that apartment, your apartment.
and this woman showed up like she knew you.
and then I found a passport.
who's Gary Miller?
that apartment, that passport, it's all for us.
it's how we're gonna get away.
when I get out of this place, I'll be working on a way for us to be together.
remember how we always talked about France?
Yeah.
our plan to be together.
James, how... how can I believe you?
how can I believe anything anymore?
and just know, just know that I love you.
you're facing some serious charges.
michael Scofield told me there are some people out there who are very determined to get you out of here.
what's he talking about?
you know nothing about this?
no.
Scofield's a smart man but, uh, he's got a rabid imagination.
so you're calling him a liar?
more or less.
I've been able to verify the story.
I already know everything, Mr. Whistler, in detail.
I just need a name.
who's in charge on the outside?
we can end this right now if you can provide it.
what are you talking about?
what's going on here?
now, start over.
there you are.
and here I am, without my bag of goodies.
I was afraid you were gone for good.
party would not be the same without you.
I'm glad you're back, cause I need a favor.
it involves you, a chicken foot and a man who's got it comin'.
what man?
now, you get well, and you get him out there in that ring, and you do that one, that... neck thing.
in exchange, I'm gonna cover all your medical expenses.
I'll tell you what. You take your time.
I'm gonna go get my bag right now, put you out of this misery.
you're the best cock in the fight, Alex.
please don't let me down.
maybe now you'll feel more comfortable telling me the truth.
are you working with Scofield?
are you working with scofield?! - Yes! Yes, I'm working with scofield.
but there's no one else involved.
as they say in America, we're gonna get this story straight.
I told him the truth.
I suggest you do the same.
I have.
he's confirmed nothing!
ask him about that woman he's been meeting with.
huh?
that's not what you think.
doesn't matter what I think; it matters what you know, and you know her name.
and the fact that he won't admit it tells me that he's no innocent bystander in this.
you know I am.
prove it.
cause that's the only way we're getting out of here.
Michael, this is suicide- they'll kill Sofia.
and they'll kill your brother's son.
this is the man who can help us, and he can't do anything without a name, so tell him!
James... we don't have a choice.
it's over.
I don't know where she lives, I don't know how you find her.
that's all I know, her name.
two more of those, please.
I'm gonna get going.
no, he'll stay.
relax... Fernando, is it?
I just want to talk a minute.
alone.
this right here is as alone as we're gonna get.
I heard about your argument with Lincoln.
you people are everywhere, huh?
now, you know him better than I do, but from personal experience, Burrows can be hard to handle.
that man does not like to be told what to do.
he sure likes bossing everyone else around.
you have to start looking out for yourself, Fernando.
level the playing field.
all you have to do is go back, apologize, tell him that you'll stay on a few more days for free.
and tomorrow or the day after, I'll call you, and you'll meet me for a drink.
in exchange, I'll pay.
50 grand.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not asking you to do anything that doesn't help everyone in the long run.
I don't see how this is helping.
Lincoln causes as many problems as he solves.
he needs to get out of his own way, and I think you can assist him.
I stay one step ahead, and you get 50 grand.
I don't know.
I think you do.
where do I find this Gretchen Morgan?
she's somewhere here in Panama city.
Aw, that's not much help in a city of a million people.
it could take days, weeks.
I've told you.
I only know her name.
I have no idea. - I do.
but I'll need to use your phone.
what phone are you on?
just listen to me.
I need to know where and when your next meeting with Susan is.
Garfield-Price building downtown in an hour. Why?
Garfield-Price, one hour.
can you give her a message for me? - Yeah.
tell her everything is going as planned.
what the hell's going on, Michael?
just give her the message, Linc.
I'll see you soon.
you should have listened.
are you going to throw down a chicken foot over a puddle of puke?
you should have mopped.
stumpy, wait your turn, man.
excuse me.
what you want to see him about?
I got one of these from him, and I didn't do nothing.
he don't listen.
the fight goes on as planned-- after we eat lunch.
you issue a fight? - Yeah.
what about it?
it's not your right.
it's not your place.
well, maybe it should be.
general: She's arrived?
I'm on my way.
you'd better be right.
what happened?
it worked.
it did? - Yeah.
she came up to me just like you said and offered me a bunch of cash to talk behind your back.
so we stick with the plan, right?
Yeah. - Cool.
I'm going to see her right now.
it's okay.
I came back for you.
come on, now, everything's gonna be okay.
you can't deprive yourself like this.
G-get out of here.
you don't mean that.
yeah... yeah, I do. I do.
talk straight.
you're not talking straight.
withdrawals are the worst way to die.
you're going to shake, and you'll sweat until you evaporate into nothing.
it's a long bumpy road to hell.
is that what you want, Alex? Or do you wanna live?
see you on the other side.
when you're up all night with diarrhea running down both your legs and vomit is in your hair...
...don't come crawling back.
it's been a long day.
let's just get this over with.
I got a message from my brother.
everything is going ahead as planned.
Really?
I would think you'd be facing a major setback.
you know Michael.
always has things worked out.
no, I don't.
seems to me he keeps screwing things up.
he's getting things done a whole lot faster than you.
Whistler's out by tomorrow, all right?
Zavala: Gretchen Morgan?
Yes.
general Zavala, Panamanian national police.
come with us, please.
Why? What's this all about? - Llevenla.
no, I don't understand. I don't understand. Wait!
I had nothing to do with this.
I had nothing to do with this! Nothing!
you're denying that you are involved with escape attempts at Sona prison.
I have never been here before in my life.
and you've never met any of the men incarcerated here?
No!
James Whistler?
no.
you know what I've been told?
from prisoners?
I can only imagine.
I've been told that you are the mastermind behind a prison escape and that you've kidnapped a boy as collateral.
Really?
am I an alien?
did I shoot JFK?
sir, I have no idea who this James Wilson whistler is!
I'm just here to relax before I have to go back to another year of teaching social studies to freshman idiots.
you're a tourist here?
no, not a tourist, S.
I like to think of myself as a "student of life."
"a student of life"?
what did he say?
turn on the hose.
I'm going to give you one chance.
did you order the escape from Sona penitentiary?
yes or no?
Zavala: Yes or no?
you seem concerned for her.
she holds our entire future in her hands.
Yeah, I'm concerned.
yes or no?
No!
you've proven one thing.
this is not your first time.
come with me.
do you know either of these men?
I've never seen them before.
that's a lie.
I've never seen them before in my life.
where and when have you seen her?
she came to see him in visitation, isn't that right?
is this the woman you work for?
did she order the prison escape?
yes or no?
Yes.
all right, all right.
you're the one in charge?
no.
I don't know anything about a prison escape.
I'm just the baby-sitter.
I watch the kid.
where is he?
near Paloma.
Highway 2.
I can take you.
take them back to my office.
put the girl back in the car.
we're going on a drive.
was it you?
did you kill Sara?
I have no idea who you're talking about.
I'm coming for you.
Congratulations.
you're a regular buster douglas, aren't you?
Hey, what is this?
how'd you get that up there, huh?
right there. Right there. He's in there.
in here?
I'm so sorry.
I am so sorry.
: I hope he's all right.
pick me up.
I'm at the shack.
bring towels.
Hi, Lincoln.
good to see you.
Yeah, thanks for the cigars.
you didn't open the package?
I didn't get around to it today.
you need to make a choice.
Lechero's days are numbered.
you agree?
then you know what you need to do.
you've done a good job so far.
now is the time to make a move.
prove yourself.
go back in and open the package.
what are they doing in here?
they were here for questioning
come on. Let's go.
what happened to the General?
the General was found dead this morning off highway 2.
you're going back inside.
I'm sorry to hear that.
he seemed like a nice man.
what you doing back here?
if you still want to get out of here, I need your phone.
go inside.
what?
how's Lj?
he's fine. You know what?
Susan's not.
he's fine? Are you sure?
Yeah.
I just got off the phone with him.
why didn't you tell me what was going on?
he could have died because of what you did.
we've still got Whistler.
as long as we do, we're okay.
I got to go.
Hey, did you see Blanco?
s walking around like the landlord.
I thought you said Lechero was going to take care of it?
he will.
how long has he been saying that?
look if you and Lechero want to go around like an old married couple, fighting this way or that... maybe you like it in the kitchen.
Hey, you be careful.
then do something!
or the next thing you know, you're gonna be taking orders from Scofield.
some people stop at nothing, huh?
uh... yeah. Whatever.
at least we're back inside.
which of course is exactly what you wanted.
isn't it?
what are you talking about?
you let the fox into the henhouse.
the only reason you gave up Gretchen's name was so she could come in and pull you out of the fire.
you wanted me to give up her name.
you know it doesn't end with her.
Yeah, I do.
the question is how do you?
how does a simple fisherman seem to know so much about the company?
when she comes back, and she will... ...
what am I gonna say?
you gonna do this or not?
you can tell her the answer is yes.
but once we're out, I consider you collateral...
nothing more.
my name is michael scofield.
I am a fugitive.
three weeks ago, I was incarcerated in a panamanian prison.
while I was there, I was approached by the company...
a corrupt organization involved in all levels of industry and government.
they gave me two options:
break one of their men-- james whistler-- out of that prison...
or they would kill the only woman I ever loved-- dr. Sara tancredi.
I held up my end and broke whistler out.
the company...
they killed sara anyway.
I don't know why the company wanted james whistler out of prison, but I've tracked him here to los angeles.
he's with an agent I know only as gretchen...
the same agent who murdered sara.
it ends today.
I will seek the justice that I now know the system cannot provide.
so if you're reading this letter, you'll know I died avenging sara's death.
you get the data card.
we drop it off in the racing form, and we get the hell out of there.
who's the contact we're leaving it for?
the company wants the card back, period.
all you need to worry about is getting this rig the hell out of there in a hurry.
Oh, I'll be getting it out of there. Don't you worry about that.
you worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time.
if you pull this off, you can come up to my room later and the word "no" won't be in my vocabulary.
just make sure we get paid.
in and out.
good to see you again.
you, too.
didn't hear from you for a while.
started to wonder if you were still interested.
I am, very much so.
well, I needed to approach this carefully.
I'm sure you understand.
who you buying it for?
a competitor? A foreign country?
Jason, you know I can't get into that.
now, we've been negotiating this for months.
I've jumped through all your hoops.
I've agreed to meet you here.
do you want to sell the card to me or not?
be right back.
that's a lot of secrets on a little piece of plastic.
let me give you a little bit of advice
and this is on the house-- watch your step with that thing.
the company will do anything to get it back.
don't I know it.
Yeah. - What the hell are you doing? We got to get out of here.
I need to hide the gun.
take the gun with you!
where is she?
Michael, you don't understand.
call gretchen, get her in here now.
you have to trust me.
I'm not your enemy, michael.
we need to leave.
you know, despite everything...
if sara could weigh in right now, she'd tell me not to kill you.
that's the kind of person she was.
that's the kind of person you took from me.
James, didn't you tell him?
he walked in five... - shut up!
Gretchen, look at me.
this is for sara. - I never killed sara.
I wouldn't expect someone like you to take this with dignity.
I swear to god she's alive.
don't. Don't insult me and don't insult her.
she escaped.
we knew if you found out we wouldn't have any leverage.
I fabricated the whole thing.
my brother saw...
a head in a box! From a cadaver.
you ask lincoln what he really saw.
listen to her, michael.
don't lie to me. - I'm not lying to you.
Lincoln bought it, you bought it, it worked.
then where is she?
I'll tell you when we get outside.
right now, we need to get out of here.
they found the bodies.
give me the gun.
she's lying. - Is she?
if you pull that trigger, you'll never know.
kill him, james. - Shut up.
where is she? Where is sara?
Michael, if you don't give me that gun, I'm going to shoot you in the head.
let's go.
we got a double homicide at the roosevelt hotel.
do you know the difference between a perfectly executed operation and a failed mission?
sir?
it's small unit leadership.
the allies spent two and a half years planning the invasion of normandy, but on d-day it came down to a handful of men on a strip of beach to decide the fate of the world.
what I'm getting at, gretchen, is even the best plan is only as good as the moving parts on the ground executing it.
general, we got your card-- what's the problem?
we have nothing. It's a duplicate.
almost flawless, but a duplicate. - That's impossible. I saw...
you know how important the retrieval of this card is to me, gretchen.
you know that this is a security breach that could have catastrophic ramifications for the company.
the only thing I can think of...
there was a blind spot when whistler was hitting the target.
maybe he made a duplicate and he still has the original.
you hired him.
you kept him at the tip of the spear.
you insisted that we get him out of sona.
we had to.
he had already made contact with the target.
at that point, it was him or no one, sir.
what's your stake in all of this?
I had nothing to do with it. Whistler acted on his own. I swear to you.
general, I can fix this.
you trained me.
not well enough, apparently.
you...
please.
I have a bank account in dubai left over from a slush fund from cobra ii. It's yours.
no, please, please...
panama CITY, PANANA hello.
Hey, it's me.
where are you, man?
Los angeles.
you okay, michael? - No, I'm, I'm safe.
thank god, thank god.
how's lj and sofia?
Yeah, they're, um...
I'm staring at them right now in fact. They're fine.
you hear about sona?
what about it?
burned down three days back. The inmates-- they rioted.
no sign of bellick, t-bag, or sucre.
he got popped-- I don't know how.
I mean, the papers listed the names of the inmates, and he was in there when it went down.
I found whistler and gretchen...
and, uh...
Gretchen said...
she said sara is still alive.
what did you see, linc?
what do you mean what did I see, michael?
I need you to tell me exactly what you saw.
Michael, sara's gone.
well, you said it was in a garage, right? So it was dark.
Yeah, it was dark.
but if you're asking me if I picked up the head to check to see if it was sara, no, michael, I-I...
LJ said he...
he only heard them kill sara, right?
you just got to come back, please. Come back. Let's just...
let's just start a new life.
tell sofia I said hi. And tell lj...
tell him his uncle loves him.
Michael, don't do this, please.
Arizona DESERT 5 MILES FROM...
out, out!
you need some better ventilation back there, amigo.
don't worry about it. Gracias.
Where's your mom?
she'll be here.
what do you mean she'll be here? We're-we're running out of time. I got to be up there.
don't worry. My mom wouldn't let me down.
at least, she hasn't yet.
Bradley! Over here!
mom! Mom! I told you!
don't worry, you'll make it there!
what is it called? - Europeangoldfinch. Net.
it's what we can all use to communicate.
Ms: I have info on Sara. Behind the Santa...
don't worry, I'm alone.
it's good to see you.
so where's your new best friend?
well...
I don't know about that, but whistler's not who you think he is.
we're working together against the company.
yeah? - Yeah.
and what about gretchen? She working with you?
he needed her to further his plan.
look, if the guy was company, he'd have shot you dead back at that conference like she wanted him to.
do you have any information about sara or not?
let's go somewhere a little more private.
I want you to tell me right now.
I want you to tell me right now, right here!
or we can get gretchen on the phone.
Gretchen's dead.
she never showed up.
come and talk to me, please.
Whistler and I were at that conference to get a data card.
it's like the company's black book.
and it lists all their agents, all their operations.
they refer to it as "scylla.
Whistler's got it.
Alex, talk to me about sara.
that's all I care about.
I understand that. I want nothing more than to get home to my wife and my son.
but that's not gonna happen for either of us with the company out there trying to kill us.
you don't know anything about sara, do you?
Whistler does. He tells me he does.
and he wants to tell you.
but he wants something in return. - What? What does he want from me?
to talk to you.
I'm sorry about all that the other night.
if i had more time, I would've explained myself better.
sure.
what are we doing here?
Alex told you about scylla?
Yes.
I have it.
there's one last step involved in order to read the data.
and that step involves breaking into a secured structure.
so now you need my help.
Yeah.
my book, the bird book, the one I lost in sona contained information that would've helped facilitate the break-in, but it can still be accomplished, with your help.
Where's sara?
the only thing I know for sure, a week ago, some information came through the wire.
Sara may have bought a bus ticket in santa fe.
headed where?
Chicago.
Michael, if sara's out there, she's not safe-- none of us are.
the company knows we still have the original card, and that's why gretchen was the first to go.
I think we're done here.
we...
have a chance for once to get scylla to people that want to take the company down.
I don't want to run anymore.
we won't have to run anymore.
I spent the last month thinking sara was dead and that it was my fault.
if she's out there, I'm gonna find her.
that's all I care about.
this can be done within a week.
less.
at least let me show you...
Oh, I'm gonna miss these gams, girl.
don't go.
this ain't no home for a white boy from alabama.
the bags are packed.
you kept your word to me.
you're the first that's ever done that. Gracias.
why must you go after this man?
you could choose not to.
where I come from, there's something called a blood feud.
Comprende?
Yes.
michael scofield left me for dead one too many times, as it turns out.
what is spanish for "little angel"?
Adios, angelita.
is this legit?
for the money you're paying, first class, all the way.
so these are coyotes one could trust.
VAMANOS.
as you've seen, what you're entering into is quite serious.
m I realize that.
you're responsible for this now.
you have nothing to worry about.
we'll talk sooN.
it's time to clean up now.
thoroughly.
everyone who was close to whistler: Scofield, mahone, burrows.
Burrows is still in panama.
clean up.
hello.
Hi, pam.
where...
where are you?
uh, you know.
in the middle of it, as usual.
panama still?
no.
no.
are you okay?
definitely.
are you?
Yes.
and cameron?
he's fine.
I have to tell you, pam, you know, I had a plan for all of us to be together.
and...
I'm not gonna stop working on it.
why do you need a plan if you want to be with someone?
you just be with them.
don't say that unless you mean it.
cause I'll turn this world upside down to get back to you.
so don't say it unless you mean it.
I mean it.
okay.
come on, babe.
I-I hate plantains, you know that.
I try your chili burger.
Chili-chili burger?
you loved the chili burger.
okay, I'm gonna make them with my mom's special recipe.
your mom's special recipe?
you'll love it.
Really? - Yeah!
it's delicious.
let's get out of here.
drop 'em.
let's go. - Give me your hand.
Yep - Let's go - Lincoln - Come with me
what's going on?
dad
we're safe now.
relax. - No.
I saw someone.
looks like company, I'm sure of it.
let's just go, okay?
let's go.
We'll-we'll be fine.
all right, all right. - Yeah.
get back.
dad!
dad, we have to run.
go.
get out of here.
run!
I'm looking for alex.
I don't know where he is.
no?
no.
uh, we've been divorced for almost two years now.
we haven't had contact in months.
I would think that might change now that he's back in the U. S.
I am so sick of you people-- what are you a fed?
- Thinking that you can keep on harassing...
I'm not with the government, pam.
mom, could you come here?
we're done talking...
Bruce bennett.
do you know who this is?
I do.
I'm looking for sara, and right now, you're the only person I can think of who can help me.
hold on.
where are you?
back in chicago.
have you heard from her?
meet me in front of the drake hotel in a half hour.
please just tell me...
is she alive?
are you michael scofield?
are you michael scofield?
Yes, I am.
hands on your head.
special agent don self, homeland security.
were you there when james whistler was killed?
I didn't kill him.
I know you didn'T.
he was an independent contractor who worked for the company for about ten years.
he was assigned to retrieve scylla once it went missing.
do you know what scylla is?
it's the company's little black book.
so he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me.
what do you want from me?
you're looking at major time.
you know that, right?
so how would you like to walk away from it all...
not do a day? - In exchange for...
Scylla.
all right.
Sara tancredi, last seen in panama, if you help me find her, maybe we've got a deal.
then go find it yourself.
to perform the operation, michael, that would require signatures from about 20 different department heads.
do you want to bet at least one of them is company?
the only way this is going to work is via freelancer, off the books.
it sounds complicated.
I'll take a pass.
I'm giving you an opportunity to avoid 15 years in jail, not to mention the time that your brother's facing.
what are you talking about?
the company tried to take him out in panama.
he, um...
reacted, apparently.
but I just made a deal with the panamanian authorities for him to serve out his time in the U. S.
he should be touching ground any time now.
you recognize this handwriting?
this is your father'S.
he spent the last two years of his life going after this very thing.
do you believe in fate, michael?
I think I'd like to talk to my brother.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
what's going...
stop!
stop!
you don't want to go in there.
you don't want to go in there.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
God, she'S...
Lilah maria sucre.
she gave her my name?
soy tu papa.
you're setting me up?
Sucre, you can't keep bringing maricruz down.
you can't do this to her anymore.
it's OK. - Wait.
don't...
Sucre, don'T...
go! Go!
Oh, boy.
we're screwed.
you know why scofield gets all twisted up when he's around me?
we're the same, and he just can't stand it.
drives his ass crazy.
we got the same brilliant mind, the same natural-born leader tendency, the same one-in-a-million-type charisma, yes?
he just gonna look down his nose at me?
how you gonna find him?
this.
you're both into birds?
no, no.
it's either gonna take me to him, or he to me.
I just know it.
if I was you, I'd forget about this scofield.
you have plenty of money. See? I mean...
how much money you have in that bag?
why don't you just mind your own beeswax, huh?
you just keep pointing this jalopy northbound, all right?
get me back to the land 'o cotton.
of course.
ready.
only a few people in government will know of the operation.
it has to stay that way, or people's lives will be in danger, mine included.
taking down the company sounds a little bigger than a two-man job, no?
I'm going to get you help.
I thought you said, you couldn't trust anybody.
Yeah, but maybe you can.
all right, two of your cohorts- fernando sucre, and brad bellick were arrested, they're both facing time, and alexander mahone is in a colorado jail cell.
good, let him sit there.
you're going to need mahone if you want to make this happen.
he was working with whistler.
and you'll have me. Okay?
whatever you need, I'll provide.
Whistler also said something about a second step, something about a break-in.
Yeah, the card has all the data on it, but it's encrypted.
once you get your hands on it, you're going to need to find a way to break into the company's headquarters.
it's the only way to unlock what's on the card.
Where's the building? - L. A.
where in L. A? - I don't know.
so, we've got a data card, which could be anywhere, and we've got to break into a building, the location of which has yet to be determined.
simple enough.
you've broken out of two penitentiaries.
I'm thinking, uh, breaking into a building isn't too far outside your wheelhouse.
how do you know our dad?
he heard from contacts that I could be trusted.
your father was a good man. - Why now?
look, I've been going after the company for five years. Okay?
when whistler was killed yesterday, the plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation.
but, uh... I convinced my superiors to give it one more chance.
so this is like job security for you? - What's that?
well, when we go out there and risk our necks, you can collect your pension.
no, no, no, lincoln.
okay, some people still care about their job.
some people still fight for this country.
maybe you've been a little too distracted boosting car stereos and breaking heads to remember that.
if we do this deal, after it's done, you can look for sara...if she's alive.
if we take this deal, we'll both be dead long before I get the chance, linc.
you guys must have some big-time friends.
what are you talking about?
somebody just posted a significant amount of bail for both of you.
who?
I don't know, but they're outside.
you're free to go.
here, take your dad's file. My number's inside.
we ain't doing this. - Just take it anyway.
this file, it means nothing to me anymore.
let's go for a drive.
Thanks.
I thought I'd never see you again.
I have something for you.
okay.
you left this behind.
is that what this is about?
you just getting me my rose back?
Yeah. I guess I'm done now. I can retire.
how much time are you looking at?
they're saying 15 years.
I have to find out for sure.
I heard lincoln say something about a deal.
no jail time.
in exchange for taking down the company.
how?
exactly.
I love you.
that's all I know right now.
will you not yield to the immortal gods?
that nightmare cannot die. Eternal evil itself.
there is no fighting her, no.
no power that can fight her.
now, listen to me- it's up to you now.
all that avails is flight.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm sorry.
6ant to talk about it?
it's not your fault. It's not.
tell me what happened.
it's just the company.
it's just what they do.
it wasn't just me. God, it was you and lj and-and lincoln.
and they won't stop, and I don't know how to deal with that.
Hey, come here.
come here. Come here.
let's go!
are you okay?
I can't believe they found us so fast.
should I call... should I call bruce and-and get some place safe?
no place is safe.
they're not gonna stop unless we stop them. Linc?
you thinking what I'm thinking?
let's end this. But I'm not gonna leave you behind again.
yeah?
we're in.
hey - Hey, papi.
I can't tell you how grateful I am for you including me.
well, sucre vouched for you, bellick.
he said you came through for him down in panama.
you ready for this? - Yeah. I am.
so I hear whistler's bird book has details about what we need to steal.
Yeah. - You know who's got it, right?
please. We'll die out here.
thanks for the cash, gringo.
first class all the way.
do we have any idea where t-bag is?
that snake could be anywhere.
when we're in L. A. We can think like convicts, we just can't act like them.
if we do, we're done.
it goes without saying- this is your last chance to back out, 'cause first on the list of things I cannot guarantee you is your safety.
we're all a long way from where this started.
but what I can guarantee you is that if we do this thing right, we'll be close to where it ends.
freedom. Finally.
you two- let's go.
Hey, mike?
what about sara?
Sara's in.
all right, we're heading out tomorrow.
I have to finalize a few things before we go.
no games and no stunts.
otherwise, I promise, you're gonna see a whole different side of me.
likewise.
fake ids. It's a good start, but there are some things you can't fake, and there are some things you can't hide.
know what I mean?
how high is your threshold for pain?
you sure you don't want a sedativ we're gonna go into the night.
how do you feel? - Lighter somehow.
look, I don't know how we're gonna take them down.
I don't even know who they are, but I do know one thing
the company's gonna pay for what they did to you.
let's go.
you sure you're up for this?
if we can do it together, um... yeah.
OK. - Absolutely.
a c-130? What do they want... want us to parachute out of this thing?
this guy called in a favor to the air force.
it's not like we can be flying commercial, you know?
if you're successful with obtaining scylla, you'll not only avoid jail time, but you can take great pride in knowing you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat to its own democracy.
if you're killed while doing so, a proper funeral will be provided.
but if you try to escape, you will have no funeral.
you will have nothing, and you will be apprehended and buried where we find you.
I sincerely hope we understand each other.
you better hold up your end of the deal.
let's go!
if you're successful with obtaining scylla, you'll not only avoid jail time, but you could take great pride in knowing you helped dismantle this country's greatest threat to its own democracy.
if you're killed while doing so, a proper funeral will be provided.
Gretchen has the rest of the pages.
we can't go any further until she gives them back.
why are we doing this again?
it's an insurance policy.
you flake out on me again, d these aren't the only set of prints I'll be copying.
Mike! Michael, what's wrong? Talk to me! Michael?
I want syclla out of los angeles by the end of the day tomorrow.
Brad, get out of there!
push it! Don't do this!
if anything should happen, call my mom in Chicago.
nothing's going to happen.
Where's Brad's body now?
we got it on its way to the morgue, and it's in the cooler at Homeland Security where nobody can find it.
that ain't part of the deal.
you said if anything happened to us, that we'd be returned to next of kin.
no. That's not exactly what I said.
no, that is exactly what you said. - No, it isn't exactly what I said, okay?
and he needs to stay a John Doe until I say otherwise. Okay?
I'm dealing with enough stuff already, and I've had my ass chewed out...
he's got... He's got a mother, you know.
if you want Scylla, and I assume you still do, Brad Bellick's body goes home to his mother.
all right, all right.
all right, I'm gonna take care of the body.
but you guys need to get out of mourning.
okay, we need to get back to work.
you need to pack Brad's stuff up, and we need to get back to work.
and Fernando, my friend, let me tell you something.
if you ever put your hands on me again, I promise you, okay, there's gonna be two bodies in the fridge.
but I need results.
Yeah, well, I need to see those missing pages.
so, what's it gonna be?
I heard you were dead.
who told you that?
a little bird.
that's awfully generous of you.
it's all a matter of timing.
the Company is moving Scylla to a bunker in Pennsylvania.
when? - Tomorrow.
you want to make sure to mention that on the phone right away, as soon as...
you know, for an ex-employee, you sure seem to know an awful lot about current Company business.
don't get paranoid.
I'm keeping one ear to the ground for your benefit, which is a really good reason to work with me and not against me.
all right, you know what? We got our pages. Let's go.
that's Enzen from transpo.
he's responsible for the power transfer.
and you know Powell.
he's supervising the security override.
it's a big job.
perhaps we should call in David Baker.
just to be safe.
that won't be necessary.
we can do this all in-house, huh?
and Scylla will be gone by morning.
I promised Brad I would call his mom if anything happened.
I'll do it if you want.
no, it's okay. I'll do it.
look at this.
he kept a badge from the police benefit.
when he was a CO in Fox River, he-he failed the test to get into the academy five times.
these are right, right?
this is a map of the Company's basement, right?
I don't know. It looks too simple.
I assumed it would be a lot more complicated than this.
these symbols-- they're...
they don't make any sense, and the letters, uh...
there's just something wrong.
this letter C-- it usually designates some kind of heating vent.
the M designates a meter.
this is some sort of condensing unit. This is a plumbing part.
it's called a P-trap. They're all completely dissimilar items.
logical design dictates they'd never be installed that randomly. It just, um... It doesn't make sense.
C... M... E. That's "See me."
these letters don't make any sense if you think of them as symbols, but they do if you think of them literally.
"do you see me?" He's asking if you see him.
where? - Here.
Yeah, but who besides you two, would come up with something like that, huh?
I mean, what's the point?
I don't know, but we're never going to figure this blueprint out if we can't find the person who drew it.
we need David Baker.
Hello, darling.
good morning. Here is your coffee-- one sugar, two creams.
and those fingerprints you ordered.
Gretchen's?
Yes. Gretchen Louise Morgan.
how did you pull off a thing like that?
I have a friend who works with the CHiPs.
but don't get too excited. There's not much there.
3-29-77, Johnstown, West Virginia.
her sister lives in Riversi. Daddy deceased.
award-winning equestrian. Iraqi war vet. I'll be damned.
clean-cut chick. At least on paper.
but I don't see any evidence that she's related to Chinese organized crime.
no husband in Beijing? No prior arrest for extortion?
Nope.
no mention of any of our friends?
I checked. No Scofield, no Burrows, no Whistler.
Whistler? How do you know that name?
James Whistler? I heard Scofield mention him one day.
what day?
the day that I met him.
in what context?
I-I don't remember. Why? What's the big deal? Who is he?
nobody. That will be all for now.
here's another one-- DavidAllenBaker.
he's an advisor to the city planning commission.
won an award for designing low-income housing.
wife is named Elaine, and there's the address.
I'll print a map.
all right, we still need that sixth card, all right?
Really? - All right.
we've got at least 30 more yards to go past the water main before we get to the Company building.
Michael, Michael, see that?
that looks like it could be some sort of obstruction in the tunnel.
whatever it is, whatever it takes, we got to get through that in the next few hours.
I want you guys to go down there and get started.
Sara and I will go and look for, uh... for David Baker.
and Bellick gets back to his mom.
Yeah, and when we get Scylla, we're walking away from this crap.
Absolutely.
I'm okay.
you got him. - Where you gonna take him?
hospital.
come on, guys, let's not freak out, all right? Calm down.
this is my decision, and not yours, and we're going to the hospital.
well, what's wrong with him?
I'll go. I'll find him.
listen, don't forget to use your fake ID at the hospital, though.
shut the door. - Okay.
Mr. White?
if you'd allow me to be nosy, how long has Trishanne been part of the organization?
temp agency sent her over about a week before you got here.
if you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at her application.
I always make a point of checking out the background of anyone who deals with my personal affairs.
I understand. I'll talk to HR. - Thank you.
Hey, uh, Cole, you know what?
um, today around noon, I really need you to step in for Andrew Blauner. Host an intro.
new franchises from Idaho. We got to knock 'em out.
I'd like to see some of that Cole Pfeiffer magic.
abracadabra.
excuse me, sir? Are you a salesman?
Yes, indeedy I am. What can I do for you?
well, I can see that you're busy, but I didn't want you to be the last to know.
Scylla is moving.
come back?
don't worry. We're gonna stick to our original plan.
what exactly is the plan?
we wait.
wait? - Yes.
okay, have you ever heard of noodling?
I don't believe so.
well, then, what kind of hillbilly are you, really?
I'll explain it to you.
Noodling... is when a foolhardy bastard swims to the bottom of a muddy riverbed and he sticks his hand down into the deepest, darkest hole.
he's looking for a prize catfish.
now, sometimes the catfish does live there, and the noodler pulls it out with his bare hand and he drags it ashore, but sometimes, he reaches in that hole and he finds a snapping turtle.
bites his hand clean off.
Scofield's a noodler.
Yes, and if he reaches into the Company hole and he finds Scylla, we take it and we sell it to Feng.
if he gets a turtle, well... Not our hand.
the contractors are here.
what the hell are you doing here? - I'm a client.
you're a client, huh? - Just keep it down; keep it down.
it's all part of the ruse.
we need some help.
I'm already providing my services, white-collar style, all right?
Where's, where's Pretty and the Fatman?
Bellick's dead.
if you joke about it, I'll rip your tongue out. Let's go, Linc.
sorry to bother you, but I'm an internist and I brought my husband in.
he's in and out of consciousness and he's got some symptoms that concern me.
I'd be really grateful if we could see a neurologist.
does he have insurance?
uh, yeah. I don't have the card, but, um, I have his I. D.
no, just fill this out. - Okay, thank you.
Mr. Freling? Mr. Freling.
Yes, that's... that's me.
is it always low?
a little.
has anyone in your family ever suffered from epilepsy, stroke, TIAs, any neurological disorder?
my mom. - Okay.
Jimmy, take this gentleman back to bay four.
why are we relocating?
the Scylla's security is the foundation of this entire organization.
I realize that, but have you thought about the ramifications?
if we lose critical access, it could compromise our timeline on stage two.
the plates and the facility are ready to print as much currency as we need at any time.
when will Scylla be installed in Pennsylvania?
Lisa, what's our timeline?
actually, there's been a bit of a problem.
dismantling the security surrounding Scylla is a bit tricky.
it may take longer than we thought.
how much longer?
I can make this happen right now.
go get David Baker.
yes?
uh, hello, I'm, uh, I'm looking for a Mr. David Baker.
he's not taking any new projects right now.
actually, I had some... some questions about something that he worked on a few years ago.
are you familiar with a project called Scylla?
I'm working!
this man would like to talk to you about Scylla.
you're Company?
Yes, sir.
I'm in logistics, and I'd like to ask you some questions about your original design.
it's been a long time since I thought about that.
be lucky to remember anything.
looks like you're pretty busy.
do you mind if I take a look?
you know, Bellick saved my life. - What?
back when we were in prison in Panama.
t-bag went crazy, he, he went nuts.
what happened?
he lit Sona on fire, told everyone to run.
they can't shoot us all, he said.
it was a stampede, bro, I...
I was down getting trampled.
I, I couldn't get up, I couldn't breathe, I thought I was going to die...
but then something pulled me back to my feet.
it was Bellick.
he saved my life.
that wall's got to come down?
unless you got a better idea. - Okay.
what was that?
I don't know. I think I stepped on something.
what's going on, Linc?
I don't know, man.
it's some kind of explosive.
explosive? Then shouldn't I be dead?
if you move, you will be.
they're underground. You're not going to be able to reach them.
right.
you know what? They'll be fine without you.
right.
you ever heard of Fox River?
maybe we could talk about it over dinner.
I got a gift card to the Red Lobster over off the interstate.
I never thought the guys would be so sad for Brad Bellick.
a lot of things have changed since Fox River.
you know you can't control this. Yeah?
it's funny, I was just about to tell you the same thing.
whatever it is, we can manage it.
we just need to know what we're dealing with.
what if I don't want to know?
should only take a few minutes. You ready?
I'm ready.
my goal is to build one city that entirely self-sustains, depending on no outside resources.
a community living entirely in harmony.
how close is it to becoming a reality?
well, that's a matter of opinion.
people look at something like this and they think it's impossible.
in reality, I could make it happen tomorrow.
like what they built in Dubai.
exactly-- grand ideas brought into reality.
this won't just serve the rich.
how long have you been working for them?
too long. I came in in '94.
I was never good at collecting a paycheck. Always freelance.
partially retired all the time.
I like to finish a job and then move on.
put it in the past.
do you always leave your name behind, instead of the correct specifications?
only on the Scylla project.
well, we're considering modifications and...
I was hoping that you could help me figure out what should really appear on those blueprints.
as of right now, they don't mean much.
didn't you read the legend?
sure.
but we still had a lot of trouble.
you're not Company.
what should I do?
stay calm. - Calm? You just said I'm standing on a bomb!
we'll work it out.
you think Gretchen set us up?
the lessons taught by our founder, Mister Harvey Hall.
pathway to personal freedom.
do people actually buy this nonsense?
let go of me.
you're coming with me or through that glass. Choose.
place of business.
gate allows us to find the pathway to personal freedom.
define our boundaries.
see past them.
let me tell you a story about the founder of this great program.
you know, I'm gonna tell you a better story about captivity than the regular old spiel.
years back, I was providing volunteer leadership in a local penitentiary.
I worked with the head guard, a big, burly, bowlegged brat.
mean as the devil.
all the prisoners were afraid of him, even the murderers.
and one day, Brad said to me,"Cole, I want you to get out of here."
I want you to get out of here right now,'cause I can tell you're a man who loves freedom.
and I said, "Well, what about you, Brad?"
what about you?
he said,"Oh, yeah, I'm...I'm..."
I'm gonna be free someday when I retire.
I recently got the news that he had passed away.
and where was he?
still in that prison.
still in the captivity of negativity.
sorry, folks.
Nah...
old Brad.
as my pa used to say, "Stand by, your glasses steady,"and drink to your comrade's eyes."
here's a toast to the dead already, and hurrah for the next to die.
I need to make sure that I would have access to your test results, so I told the triage nurse that I was your wife.
has a nice ring.
are you Kevin Freling?
Yes, I am.
I'm Dr. Malden.
I'm a neurologist. And you're...
cameron Eberline. I'm a...an internist.
do you have the results?
it's gonna take a little while.
uh, looking at the family history, I'd like to admit you here.
we're working on a room.
just for now, until we get the test results back.
I don't think that'll be necessary, but thank you.
it would be best if you could rest where you could be monitored.
after that, we'll determine what the best course of action is.
Agreed?
I think we have to go. I'm sorry.
hold on, hold on-- how long...
how long will it take to get the results?
couple of hours.
but we'll get you in a room before then.
just wait here.- Thank you.
you know what happens?
they take over your life.
you don't own it anymore.
that is not what happened to me.
then, somehow you stayed out of trouble.
you did what they told you to do.
maybe that's why you stuck around, huh?
right here in Los Angeles.
in my case, they had something on me, and they used it and they never let me go.
they've killed hundreds, thousands of people in the pursuit of power, you know that.
we lost a good man yesterday trying to stop them.
they hurt a lot of people, David.
look...
I stay out of the politics.
it was a job.
I specialized in security engineering.
the Scylla project was a choice assignment, so I took it.
they told you what it was, didn't they?
they told you what it was, and now you wish that you never helped them, but you're trapped.
you're trapped like I was.
you talk like it's all in the present.
it is!
I know you want to move on.
look at what you're doing. Are you trying to make up for something?
forget the charitable city of the future, and worry about the world that you live in right now, David.
what they did-- what they're doing-- is not my fault.
you put your name in there for a reason.
you wanted someone to find you, and if you tell me what I need to know, I can do something for both of us.
where is your husband?
he went to run some errands-- he should be right back.
that's his car in the driveway, isn't it?
just a moment. I'll call him on his cell.
excuse me!- Backup requested, southeast door.
you knew about this, didn't you?
first of all, I have no idea why the Company would want to put an explosive device of any kind under their own building.
we're under the courtyard.
and you know what, I honestly had no idea that any of this was even here.
that being said...
these look a lot like JZ33 anti-personnel blast mines.
back in Fallujah, the Muj used to bury them outside their firm base.
get rid of them.
I'm no expert, but I have an idea.
what's beeping?
it beeps!
wow, you must've stepped on this just right.
your weight is evenly distributed across the pressure plate, and you haven't engaged the firing pin.
you can't move an inch.
we know. What's your idea?
well, my idea is that he moves an inch.
that way, I can get to the hole, and I can dismantle the firing pin.
right now, he's standing on it, and I can't do anything.
no, no, no, Linc.
what?- Call your brother, please.
you-- you stay here.
fine.
it's my brother.- Michael...
let's go.
you're not leaving, are you?
you have our number.
and who are you again?- He prefers to wait at home. I'm monitoring him.
he's leaving AMA in a potentially fragile condition.
look, I'm not stupid.
I know who you are, and I'm not gonna turn you in.
my concern is for what's going on with your health.
they aren't here for you, and I'm telling you, in your condition...
thank you, Doctor; I appreciate your help.
please do call us.
can I help you?
I messed up.
what do you mean?
today, I was working with Bagwell.
he's been compliant as hell.
I thought that I would make him happy.
he wanted to talk about Gretchen Morgan.
right, and what happened?- And I slipped up.
I mentioned Whistler.
this one is tough, I'm telling you.
Bagwell, Gretchen Morgan-- they're thugs.
I have been face down with a gun to the back of my head more than once.
all right.
look, I don't want you to do something that you don't want to do.
you're a good agent-- we could reassign...
no, no, that is not it.
look, I can handle this.
I'm just...
I'm just kicking myself.
I could find something else for you to do, okay?
this thing has gotten way out of hand.
dallow is on my back, and the Company is moving Scylla...
no.
I'm fine.
are you sure?
I really think we can do this, Don.
we can bring the Company down.
ego is the only reason I coded my name into those blueprints.
I don't feel guilty about anything.
I gotta take this. I'm sorry.
Hello?
Alex, we...
got a problem.- There's a damn minefield down there.
Hello, I can't hear you.
sucre's in trouble.
he's standing on a mine.
we need to deactivate it.
Linc, I gotta go. I'll call you back.
they're here, David.
what do they want from me?
they're moving Scylla, protecting it
everything you did for them, they want you to do it again.
you think you can stop them?
I know all about you.
I've known about you for six months-- ever since somebody stole those plans from the Company.
it will never work.
you won't get past the first wall.
what about the first wall?
what's gonna stop me, huh?- The minefield?
please don't tell 'em.
we've got him. Sweep the area.
there's a dirt road at the bottom of the hill.
it will take you out.
your husband...- Just go. He won't help you; that will.
lincoln, go call him again.
Linc, go call him.
Linc, go call him!- What will Michael know about this?
I mean, it's not exactly within his realm of expertise.
we're wasting time.
I gave you a semiprofessional assessment.
what's wrong?
you don't trust me, Fernando?
why should he?
because we all want the same thing: Scylla.
and I'm not gonna let a giant pack of firecrackers stand in our way.
or would you like me to call the bomb squad?
look, I am offering to do you a massive favor here.
if that thing blows while I'm pulling the pin, he loses a leg - I lose a face!
now, don't worry, Fernando.
I'm known for my steady hand.
take a deep breath, okay?
keep your weight even.
and I need you to shift slowly, very slowly
one inch to your left, so I can get to the pin.
Oh, no, I can't...I can't, I can't do it.
are you all right?
have you, uh, heard anything?
they have to deactivate.
I got a key.
a legend to the blueprint.
Baker gave you this?
no. His wife gave it to me. They came for Baker.
all right, well, this makes more sense.
these, uh, these symbols aren't for p-traps, they're...
they're microphones.
and the letter "V" isn't for vacuum, that's a generator.
this is a line of JZ33 land mines buried 80 millimeters underground, about seven feet from the outer wall
that's must be what - Linc was talking about.
it says,"Manual override only."
all conventional attempts to dismantle the JZ33 will activate the Scylla alarms.
this isn't just a land mine.
this is, uh...this is an alarm.
we can't sit here all night.
okay?
you ready?
Hey, it's Linc.
you know what to do.
what are you doing?
stop!
stop!
don't move. Don't move.
don't move.
you can't dismantle the land mine without setting off the alarm.
so I either set off the alarm or blow up and die.
no.
there's a manual override.
it'll cut the power long enough for you to step off without removing the pin.
how do you know for sure?
I found David Baker.
sucre. Step off.
you can do it. You only have 20 seconds. Come on.
I can't... - yes, you can. yes, you can.
michael and I figured it out.
step off right now.- No, no, you guys all go.
I'll-- we all don't have to die.
I'll do it alone.- Nobody's gonna die today!
step off!
step off.
what's behind this wall?
Scylla.
when do you find out?
the doctor is supposed to call, uh.
any minute.
look, um...
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you today.
don't worry about it.
you know, what Gretchen did for Sucre made me realize we could use her.
I asked for the sixth key.
What'd she say?
she's on it.
you all right?
all right.
we're about to go to the airfield. We're gonna ship Brad's body off to his mother.
Sucre: Got his things here.
where is he?
over here.
his mother will appreciate that.
Sucre: Mrs. Bellick.
this is fernando sucre.
great job today.
I'm sorry to hear about your friend.
but that's, um, admirable work, volunteering with a bunch of criminals like that.
we're all the same, really.
here's the application you requested for the desk girl.- Thanks.
you have a good night, Cole.
you, too. Thanks.
Hello? Hello?
okay We will. Thank you.
as we've all learned the hard way, there's an electronic alarm barrier around the perimeter of the foundation.
unfortunately, that is scylla's most primitive line of defense.
the wall itself is fortified with steel fiber.
the good news is, on the inside here, there are no cameras.
the company doesn't want any visual evidence that scylla exists.
the bad news is that there are both weight and microphonic sensors here and here that will alert company security to the presence of any breathing human being that weighs more than two pounds.
as far as I can tell, the first challenge is getting around that wall.
and then we can worry about crossing the floor.
Sucre: Without touching it.
Mahone: In silence.
it's complicated.
but, uh, I'm already working on something.
Brad didn't die in vain.
we can make this work.
that was the neurologist.
you have a hypothalamus hamaratoma.
it's really rare. You were probably born with it.
um, things have changed- it's been growing, which is why you've been experiencing your symptoms.
and the doctor feels that you need surgery.
two days.
that's, uh, that's what I need.
no. Tomorrow.
otherwise you could die, and there's no alternative.
this is Sylla
you are not even close to get out of here.
dad, it's me. - Lisa?
I'm at gun point. It's Tancredit
she says if you don't let Michael and the others leave with Scylla, she'll kill me.
don't!
I'm leaving. - No, Mr. White!
turn around!
gentle now, sugar.
that's Special Agent Miriam Holtz to you, sugar.
we have it!
they got it.
I never thought you'd make it this far.
I was wrong.
what now?
this is all your transfer paperwork.
I need to get to Dallow, ASAP.
what happened to Gretchen?
she got away.
he screwed us.
self can't do that.
he's government. He can do what he pleases.
the vans are coming. They're just late.
he ain't coming back!
you don't know that, Linc! They're coming!
what do we do now?
call Homeland.
see how much they know about Self.
herb, it was Scofield and Burrows.
are you at the Senator's office?
I think I'm shot!
I'm shot!
Miriam's, gone, okay?
what's your position?
you were right about this whole operation.
no. Burrows, Burrows!
no, no no no.
I need to find Gretchen.
you gonna help me?
or you gonna make me shoot you in the face?
help.
department of Homeland Security.
I'd like to talk to Don Self's superior, please.
one moment, please.
we gave this guy something worth $100 million.
is he even with Homeland? Did we see a badge?
we were given guns and flown out on a C-130.
he didn't work for the DMV.
that doesn't make him the law.
no, it don't.
what if Homeland was in on this from the beginning?
this is Herb Stanton. Who the hell's this?
Hello?
Hello!
the way Self played this, I don't know.
he kept himself too insulated.
that's why, that's why he hesitated with official authorizations on behalf of our mission.
he kept saying it was because he didn't want the Company to find out.
in actuality, it's because he didn't want to get caught, - the son of a bitch! - He kept the circle tight.
left the rest of us holding the bag.
if Homeland knows where we're at, sooner or later they're coming for us.
let them come we didn't do anything wrong. We have deals.
no, we have paper. That's what Self left us.
that's what we have.
we can't leave. Michael needs surgery.
I'm not talking about running.
I'm talking about surviving.
what I want is to see the Company burned to the ground and you in prison.
we did this to you. We did this to you.
they're ready for you downstairs, sir.
today marks a critical juncture in our endeavor.
do we have a bead on Scylla yet?
our security, our future stands at a great precipice.
it's a yes-or-no question, Jonathan.
and we don't need a soliloquy.
Howard, why don't you wait in my office?
no.
I'm in here making sure this operation isn't fumbled as well.
out... now.
what's your plan, Jonathan?
that's what we're all here for, right?
you tried to move Scylla over our better judgment, and it backfired, so spill it.
any further questions?
very well.
you have your assignments.
access your assets and retrieve Scylla today.
Yeah, well, a lot of people that believed in me in the last few months, Agent Self, not all of them are alive today.
I can't shake that line.
all that avails is flight.
come on.
here, take that.
Sara's right.
we need to get you to a hospital now.
we were so close to the finish line, Linc.
so close.
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
listen, I, uh, I spoke to LJ yesterday.
told him this was almost over.
I'm keeping my word to my son, Michael.
I should have seen this coming.
no, no, it's no one's fault.
self played all of us.
we gotta get out of here.
this is our last option.
Yeah.
take upstairs.
clear!
it's clear.
now we know where we stand.
let's go.
hello.
Yes.
herb Stanton, Department of Homeland Security.
we want to talk.
can you please come back to the warehouse?
all right, but first we're gonna need some assurances.
what kind of assurances?
look, we held up our end of the deal, so we're gonna need you to honor the terms of our agreements.
well, I'd have to take another look at those terms, but I'm fairly certain it didn't include stealing Scylla or killing two federal agents in cold blood.
what are you talking about?
here are the new terms I'm prepared to offer.
come back, turn yourselves in...
wait a minute! Self set us up!
don't, and I'll hunt you down like animals.
we did what they said.
I ain't going down on some trumped-up murder charge.
self pinned two murders on us.
what are you doing, Linc?
if Homeland Security comes...
then we'll handle it.
you know what?
there's gotta be a point where you draw the line.
now's the time to draw that line.
don't be stupid. You can't fight off all of Homeland.
stupid is listening to the government.
I ain't going back to death row.
we can still hold onto our deals.
all we have to do is flush Self out, prove he has Scylla.
how are we gonna do that?
we have to devise another strategy.
we should start devising a plan that can get us a hundred miles across the Mexican border.
that's what we should do.
my cousin Petey can hook us up.
we're not running.
we can't.
negative on Scofield, Burrows and Mahone.
tdz think that Self may be using a bakergrip to mask his cell phone signal.
place a tactical team around Homeland.
if Self or any of those other bastards show up, make damn well sure they don't get near the building.
I can't go back to living in and out of motels, constantly looking over my shoulder.
nothing changes. We take down the Company.
we finish what we started.
who are you calling?
a doctor.
Sara, not now.
when?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, listen.
Cole Pfeiffer, an employee of GATE, a downtown wellness organization, and his yet-unidentified-female accomplice both seen here in police sketches.
detective say the pair... - and then ???
have our people at DOT monitor every traffic camera from San Diego to the Bay Area.
I can't believe you shot him.
knowing when to sever a cancerous limb to preserve the rest of the body...
he was one of your most trusted advisors - When I brought you in - and confida...
I told you that a cardholder has certain responsibilities.
if you can't handle what we're doing here, it's time you let me know.
ceo Gregory White who was shot and killed in the standoff.
police are trying to determine whether revenge or robbery was the motive.
Cole Pfeiffer was a recent addition...???
maybe we weren't the only ones left hanging, huh?
if we're gonna flush Self out, how do you think he intended to unload Scylla?
he's got to sell it.
tell me when I'm getting warm.
you hand-picked Michael Scofield and the bunch, trucked them all out here on Uncle Sam's dime, to do your bidding, and now they're standing right in the crosshairs for what you did.
I gotta hand it to you Don, if that ain't the Mona Lisa.
I always said cops are more crooked than criminals.
let me guess-- a little, little slice of heaven, is that what it was for?
gambling debt?
maybe you're a... a geologist of the rock candy variety?
the information you got from Gretchen's prints
you sure it's the right address?
right as rain. - Good. Now, shut up or I'm gonna shoot you.
understand me?
Oh, I, I... - Shut your mouth. I ain't...
I know when Shut your mouth. to shut my...
be quiet.
how long does it take to find a pay phone in this city?
they'll be back.
okay.
same deal as before.
no physical duress for the next eight hours.
here's the thing.
you need help.
and running around trying to track down Self isn't safe.
we could be in Mexico in a few hours.
there are doctors there that I trust.
and you've been taking care of all of us. I think it's really okay if we take care of you.
surgery or no surgery...
I'm never gonna be able to live with myself unless I find a way to take these people down.
it's that simple, and, uh... I get it.
I'm not gonna demand that you feel the same way.
I'm telling you, we can't trust anyone-- government, law enforcement...
which is all the more reason we should consider getting out of here.
no. We deal with this now.
I want this guy as much as you do, but we're scrambling here.
I mean, I don't know how long Self has been planning this thing and from the looks of it, it's pretty air-tight.
I hope you're calling me to tell me where Scylla is, Lincoln.
you don't know? - I don't know.
what's going on?
self double-crossed us and he took Scylla.
you know where he could be?
if I'm Self, I'm looking for a new buyer.
a new buyer?
you know what?
if you're playing me, I'm gonna split you in half.
Yeah.
I want him just as badly as you do. Where are you? I'm coming to you.
grand Hope Park. One hour.
what?
sis.
it's... Emily. She's, um...
been in an accident.
I want you to tell whoever's got that gun pointed at you to grow a set and get on the phone.
she wants to talk to you.
what's up, Gretchen?
time to come home now.
are we really gonna keep trusting that bitch?
Gretchen and T-Bag were waiting at GATE with machine guns, guys.
you think they just wanted to provide cover?
this chick's a mercenary.
she'll do whatever it takes to get what she wants, and right now we just happen to want the same thing.
we are taking precautions, but...
one way or the other, Gretchen's gonna get us to Self, and right now that is all that matters.
we don't stand a chance.
our photos aren't plastered all over the TV.
homeland's keeping it in-house.
we have a chance.
senator?
we sponsored this operaton with the best of intentions, but the secretive manner in which we've handled it
I now fear is working against us.
how so? - We're in the middle of a manhunt, and it's just you and a couple of agents out there trying to rein in these cons. It's madness.
what we initally sponsored didn't pan out..
that doesn't mean that the boat is taking on water.
no one knows.
that's the way it's going to stay.
come in!
good afternoon.
richard Sooter, US Marshals Service.
I've been sent at the request of Deputy Director Esmar to get to the bottom of the Scofield/Burrows Supermax story once and for all.
I'm hoping you gentlemen can help.
guys, if there's a reason you're keeping secrets... just fill me in here. I can help.
how strong is your stomach?
very.
he's working with Donald Self.
we got a record of all incoming and outgoing calls from Homeland today.
Stanton received a call lasting approximately one minute that was connected to no one.
no one we could identify.
self's phone.
D. O.T. has a positive ID on Gretchen from a traffic cam. She's still in Los Angeles.
Chris is on the phone from Johannesburg, looking for an update.
I'll call back.
now, about this Mr. Stanton...
Alex, how are you doing?
no sign of Gretchen yet.
no sign of Gretchen.
she ain't here yet, bro.
all clear.
all right, here we go.
that's far enough.
Ah...
that's far enough.
I'm sorry, Rita.
I promise everything is going to be okay.
Yeah, we're all friends here, Rita.
don't worry about a thing.
you know, sending Feng after me almost cost me my life, and it did cost me my plan, which is why you're here, Gretchen.
you're going to help me find a new buyer for Scylla.
you've been talking to Scofield and the boys, huh?
Yeah, how are they?
good and pissed.
Yeah, where are they?
gee, Don, I don't know, I'm not their mother.
you're not their mother, but...
she looks just like you.
doesn't she? She's...
got those big blue eyes.
I'm supposed to meet them in a half an hour.
get ready to phone in a tip to homeland.
where at?
where?
to perform the operation, Michael, that would require signatures from about 20 different department heads.
the only way this is going to work is via freelancer
I should be thanking you.
