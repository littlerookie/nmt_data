you must've felt it. it shook the whole lab.
no, uh, we didn't, uh, feel anything.
none of our instruments recorded any seismic activity.
that's why G. D. was built here.
there are no strike-slip faults,
no volcanic activity.
this here is stable.
you, I'm not so sure.
what?
I mean, they do let me carry a gun.
and I know what an earthquake is.
what else knocked over those jars?
well, it was probably you.
I mean, the lab is full of fumes.
maybe you just got dizzy.
and could you please get cleaned up?
you're dripping mucus on my floor.
runny nose?
no, I'm fine. I'm not light-headed.
that's good to hear.
how's the Fifi situation?
the late biomimetic dog?
Oh, um, Fifi.
Yeah, that was, uh, sad.
I mean, kind of fun-- no--but sad.
so what's the status on the investigation?
uh, there isn't one.
I mean, it's not my job to investigate malfunctioning toys.
Carter, they are hardly toys.
the eureka dog show has led
to some incredible breakthroughs.
artificial skin for burn survivors.
compact neural computers.
nasal spray that allows soldiers to sniff out explosives
based on canine nose chemistry.
the dogs themselves are a great marketing potential.
just imagine a dog that never eats,
never urinates, and never dies.
Fifi died.
well, the owner thinks that it was sabotage,
and I need you to find out.
I've got some corporate R&D people coming to the show,
and they don't want to invest in dogs that fall apart.
excuse me.
could anything be a bigger waste of my time?
I need carter. The answer's yes.
did you get the data on the seismic motion scan?
unclear.
those are the details I need to go over with him.
okay.
all right, what do you want to know?
there was a weird light, and everything started to shake.
shut up, Carter. there was no earthquake.
Jo was 50 feet from you. She would've felt it too.
I need a favor.
and that's how you ask?
who raised you?
Oh, man, what a-- wow!
Yep, the brains of global dynamics.
the computer core.
logic diamond processors
connected with tantalum beams.
if you networked every computer made in the last 30 years,
it wouldn't come close to the power in this room.
Dr. Stark, it's-- it's so great to see you.
usually no one comes down here unless there's a problem.
here, let me show you my radial upgrades.
actually, I'm just here for the clearances.
Oh, yeah, that.
Douglas fargo was supposed to bring the paperwork.
I assume he-- yeah, I'll go find him.
I didn't know that they use diamonds in computers.
Mm-hmm. yeah.
the aligned carbon-14 allows hyper-dense qubit storage
in an optical quantum processor.
diamonds can store tons of data
and transmit it super fast.
Oh, cause I had no idea.
Yeah. No one does
because they keep them all locked down here.
fargo, all ready for the dog show?
don't even start with me, Tracy.
so who are you helping this year?
jackson's poodle? It could use a bigger brain.
no, I'm actually sitting this one out.
a little too competitive.
I see. Interesting.
what am I doing here, anyway?
well, Dr. Fox is kindly giving me one of her logic diamonds.
they're strictly regulated,
but being science director does have its privileges.
I just need a law enforcement signature
to take it out of the building.
all right.
big experiment, I'm assuming.
something hopefully disfiguring.
actually, it's just a wedding gift for ally.
a singular diamond for a singular woman.
it's, uh, very beautiful, Dr. Stark.
um, thumbprint right here.
thank you, Dr. Fox.
Thanks, Carter! sure.
Hey, I heard about Fifi. Tragic.
guess the field's wide open this year.
actually, I'm investigating the earthquake.
Yeah, there, uh
there are no earthquakes in eureka.
uh, so I'm told.
well, if you want a second opinion,
you can always ask Dr. Hood.
he's retired, but he used to be the top dog in seismology,
Vulcanology, geology.
pretty much anything dirty, and he was in it.
all right, thanks. nice to meet you.
Dougie fargo? that wild man?
did he tell you about the time
we were running those columbian drugs?
uh, no. -yeah.
columbia med school wanted to make mineral-based vaccines.
so Doug and I trekked all over Alaska
Gatherin' Eriochalcite for those yahoos.
crazy times.
so what can I do you for?
well, uh, I was at a farm near the lake.
and, uh, there was an earthquake,
but nobody felt it but me.
is that possible?
depends, how drunk were you?
I'm sorry, man.
it's really not very likely.
Yeah, because there aren't any earthquakes in eureka.
this place is rock solid.
I'm having trouble finding someone who believes me.
I can relate.
I spent the last year of my career being the guy
no one believes.
anyway, where are we talking?
around here.
all right.
Nope. sorry.
nothing going on down there.
dead as Toledo on a Saturday night.
the next time I feel the ground shake
and see the northern lights inside,
I'll just leave the bar.
never mind.
I gotta get back to the case of the dead fake dog anyway.
never mind.
northern lights, huh?
Fifi's owner still won't release the remains.
she's afraid we're going to steal
her doggie-building secrets.
well, that case gets better and better.
she still thinks Dr. Young sabotaged her entry.
so you think you wanna talk to Dr. Young?
no.
you wanna ask around?
see if anybody else's dogs malfunctioned?
no, because this is stupid.
there isn't a crime.
those people waste thousands of dollars
millions.
millions of dollars making something
they're giving away for free in every pound in America.
people need hobbies, Carter.
I used to collect handcuffs.
and meanwhile, there was an earthquake
which no one felt but me, which is impossible.
because there are no earthquakes in Eureka.
Dr. Hood?
sheriff, you were right.
there's somethin' brewin' down there
and she's fixing to blow.
it's just a hole. just a hole.
stay to the left.
Carter. -Yeah, oh, no,
I already spoke to him.
he understands. He, uh, is really sorry.
sorry? he could've killed somebody.
Dr. Hood!
haven't we talked
about your using the tunneler?
well, talk to him.
he's the one that told me about the triboluminescence.
The--the-- colored lights.
rocks under seismic stress
can sometimes release visible electromagnetic energy.
so I dove down. you ready?
all my readings indicate there's a pressurized
komatiite melt under this town.
somewhere. -Wait. ho, ho, stop!
There--there's something melting under the town?
like what--what, like a volcano?
not like a volcano. And it could erupt at any time.
and it's not linked to any known fault system.
that's why your quake was so localized.
a pocket of magma developed spontaneously?
that's impossible.
did impossible cover my friend with mucus?
he's got a point.
okay. I'll have the geo lab look into it.
you stay above ground.
so what, uh, should we start talking evacuation?
uh, maybe hospitalization.
Carter, there is no magma chamber.
Dr. Hood is unstable.
uh, not so much. Seems like a smart guy.
look, five years ago,
hood predicted a 9. 6 on the Reelfoot fault.
we evacuated Memphis.
was there an earthquake in memphis?
no. Hood cracked under the pressure.
he left right after that
because he kept seeing things that just weren't there.
Carter, please,
I need you to keep your eye on him.
don't let him do any more damage.
okay. I'll see you later.
Oh. Appreciate it. Bye.
acoustic physics is a challenging class, Zoe.
don't beat yourself up about it.
it's very complicated stuff.
let's go back to the beginning.
there's two main sections
what are you guys doing?
rayl Wave Dynamics.
um, careful, Jack.
it's an Acoustic Pressure Wave.
she's trying to figure out the frequency
to melt copper ore.
so you can really, um,
melt metal with, uh, sound.
Yeah, I don't even understand it well enough to explain
why I don't understand it.
do you want coffee?
uh, no, thanks.
um, I got something
I really don't want to do.
I can relate.
Yeah. As can I.
hmm. what are you avoiding?
Oh, just some troubling errand
I can no longer ignore.
see ya later. yeah.
Zoe, could you, uh, clear table number five, please?
why not?
I'm gonna fail this class anyway.
but, uh, that's how diamonds are made, right?
well, not unless you crack under the pressure.
Hey! You are going to have to clean that!
what are you doing, Dr. Hood?!
I'm dropping a shear wave probe!
you want a turn? It's a blast!
No! I'm good!
can you shut it off, please?!
Dr. Hood.
you can't drill in here.
I need to measure P-Waves if I'm gonna find this magma pocket.
this is the best spot
to crack through the igneous uplift.
you sure there's really anything to find?
Oh, sure. I'm sure.
I can hear the roaring, I just haven't seen the tiger.
Oh, you've talked to Allison.
there's something happening here, sheriff.
this isn't like Memphis. -Maybe.
but I still want you to pack it up and go home.
okay? Just let Global handle this.
and I need your, uh, tunneling car thingy
off the road.
do you mind if I tow her home?
all above ground. I promise.
I just want to wash her up
before she gets rusty.
sure. Sure.
okay. thanks.
that's too bad.
it was fun getting dirty again.
this, uh, this map
has gotta be, what, 70 years old?
what is it you-- you're gonna build here?
a hotel.
our corporate visitors are used
to a certain level of service.
this spot is perfect.
but I found records
that showed some traces of radiation.
well, you know,
radiation is like penny candy.
it comes in all different kinds of flavors.
you think you can scan something for me, correct?
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. You know.
but a wide-spectrum survey
is a very complicated process.
you're my man. -Absolutely.
okay.
she's a liar!
she actually accused me of sabotage?
uh, your name came up.
I wouldn't touch her crappy stuffed animal
with a ten-foot pole.
but you're happy
Fifi's out of contention?
are you joking?
this was my year to finally crush her in front of everyone.
my dog is perfect.
Yeah, he's--he's-- he's a champ.
you should see him run.
it's like Seabiscuit.
here. toss him one.
all right.
Hey, buddy. you wanna run?
you wanna run?
I'm telling you right now,
he's a winner.
what can you say?
he's such a great competitor.
Yeah. And the second one to blow.
I sent Fifi to G. D.
uh, take what's left of Thunder
and see what you can find.
Wa--wait. I get to look inside?
Yeah. I want a complete dogtopsy.
thank you.
Oh, no.
Just--and down, Fargo.
hello. Is everything okay in there?
I can't believe you convinced me
to try this on.
no one wears a big white dress their second time around.
but tell me you don't love it.
it's fabulous for an Amazon.
honey, you can't tell anything without a fitting.
I don't have time for a fitting.
I have a job, and it's not
planning a wedding.
it'll just take a second.
and presto.
aren't you the beautiful bride?
Ca--can I, uh,
try it on next?
was that an earthquake?
no, a tunnel-drilling lunatic.
just get me out of this.
it's--it's not working.
Triboluminescence must've shorted the circuit.
Ugh, forget it.
you called?
you have something to tell me?
I do.
hood has been tunneling again.
I told you to keep an eye on him.
I am. He promised me he wouldn't do it any more.
promised? promised?
okay, let me be perfectly clear here.
I need him to stop.
all right. uh, Dr. Hood!
we gotta pack it up.
Allison.
a little fancy for the afternoon,
but you pull it off.
do you know why I'm in this dress?
laundry day?
because you knocked out half the circuits on main street.
there was a temblor?
I knew one was coming. When exactly?
ten minutes ago.
uh, and you knew because you've been tunneling again?
no. I was here ten minutes ago.
that quake was the real deal.
pressure's building.
there is no magma pocket under eureka.
please take the nice doctor home.
Hey, vera wang, you want proof?
I'm out here tracking a vent, it's ready to pop.
come on, give me 30 seconds.
you look pretty.
thank you.
a little princessy, but I like the neckline.
okay, your time's up.
Ah, come on, a little grace period?
I'm trying to nail a fumarole eruption
down to the second here.
Oh, no. What's a fumarole?
a mud volcano.
you see that?
I'm back in the game, baby.
all right, you.
you go that way and then meet me...
I like the neckline,
but not so crazy about the color.
we're sinking zero-balance
p-wave detectors all along the ridge.
I re-tasked the geo satellites to look for ground deformations.
sounds good, what's all that gonna tell us?
nothing, we just like sounding smart.
no, the fumarole proves
that there's pressurized magma down there.
now we have to find out exactly where it is
and how big of a problem we have.
maybe Hood's our problem.
sure made quite a prediction,
and seems like he likes being top dog again.
Really?
you think he could cause this?
well, that's what the instruments are gonna tell us.
hopefully before they reach critical mass.
Carter. Yeah, look, Fargo, I
fine.
gotta go.
Thorne's, uh... doggy dissection.
let me know if your probing produces anything.
fargo, I have a lava problem right now.
I don't have time to worry about fake dogs.
Ooh, well, do you have time
to worry about national security?
logic diamonds.
that's how these dogs always won.
they were juicing.
but the neural nets couldn't handle the load.
I thought all these diamonds
were supposed to be locked in a vault.
exactly, so not only are they cheaters,
they broke federal law.
have fun in gitmo, ladies.
relax. I'll talk to them.
I already tried that.
they said they have no idea
how the diamonds got into the dogs.
likely story.
okay, first, leave the interrogations to me.
and second,
if they both have diamonds,
we need to go to the source.
it looks like a logic diamond.
Yes! j'accuse Fifi!
I thought all the diamonds were under your supervision.
these aren't from our lab.
the manufacturing facility in pensacola
puts a code on every diamond they make.
the inventory's continually checked.
so someone else can make these?
there's several countries with covert programs.
china, north korea.
I'll check with intelligence,
see if they know of any missing stones.
all right, let me know as soon as you get an answer.
stupid.
can't find the zipper?
Oh, yeah.
I got an M. D. And two PhDs, and I can't get myself out of this stupid dress.
Thorne wants to see me five minutes ago.
can you, um
Yeah, can you help? thank you.
used to be pretty good at this.
the micro lock is damaged.
you just need to-- yeah, it's like
super-velcro. I-I know.
so-- I should have believed you
when you told me about the earthquake.
no, you didn't feel it. I know it sounds crazy.
no, lean back.
coming from you, I should have listened.
I don't know, it's just the pressure.
I feel like I've got a million things Pushing in on me.
Yeah, a little more. It's like I can't breathe.
like-- like you're trapped in a wedding dress?
a little more.
okay, it's just-- yeah.
there. Got it. You got it?
Oh, thank--Thank you.
so is this why you called?
no, I, um
we haven't been able to pinpoint
the magma pocket yet.
but the resonance indicates that it could be manmade.
you're thinking by a disgraced geologist
looking to fix his reputation?
well, pressure makes you do crazy things.
there is this remarkable jumble of radiation.
I mean, here, where you want to put your hotel,
there's everything from x-rays all the way up through gamma.
I mean, I'd love to know why it's there,
but it's very powerful,
and the source is right here.
interesting.
and I'll give you all the specific frequencies once I've run the samples.
Oh, that's not necessary.
you've given me all the information I need.
it seems that my hotel project's
gonna have to go back to square one.
wait.
that's it?
Oh, that's it.
all this clean-up is gonna cost billions,
and my intention is to make money,
not waste it.
so I'm just gonna have to find an alternate site.
and henry, property development can get very contentious.
so can we keep this between us?
for now?
Yeah, don't worry.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
how's it going?
we could get some nasty lava bombs.
it'd be easier to predict if I could find the pocket.
Yeah, unless you already know where it is.
Allison thinks it's manmade.
by some old volcano man who wants one last ride
on the ferris wheel?
I'm just doing my job.
some things you don't mess with.
well, somebody did.
take a pretty fancy machine to liquefy bedrock.
Ah, this town loves its fancy machines.
Yeah, no joke.
these guys build dogs,
they could probably figure out how to light a volcano.
well, they both explode.
some of the owners have been cheating with logic diamonds.
I got dogs exploding all over town.
that's a dog show I could get into.
have you tried finding out where the diamonds were mined?
uh, yeah, yeah, no luck so far.
well, I could shoot yours
through the old gas-liquid chromatograph.
only take a second.
might tell you where they're from.
all right. All right.
every mine in the world produces diamonds
with a unique molecular structure.
like a fingerprint?
Yeah, or a really expensive snowflake.
so it looks like our little friend here
is all the way from...
something's messed up here.
it says that the carbon signature is from eureka.
is there a diamond mine here?
no.
but they used to mine coal.
we've been down here an hour.
if we're looking for diamonds,
shouldn't we be in a spooky, old diamond mine?
you mean instead of a spooky, old coal mine?
Yeah, but the system told us
it came from this anthracite vein.
it's weird, I know.
sheriff, look at this.
that's not coal.
raw diamonds.
but they're not natural.
someone's transforming the anthracite
into isometric-hexoctahedral carbon-14.
someone's cooking logic diamonds.
watch out.
doc!
doc!
doc.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
it's just my arm.
what was that? a security system?
no, I'm an idiot.
it's an acoustic wave generator.
they're using intermittent bursts.
we just happened to get caught.
somebody's growing these diamonds
with rayl pressure waves.
and they're doing it on a massive scale.
hold on. Rayl waves?
Zoe was studying with one of those things today at cafe diem.
and it could melt metal.
could it melt rock?
I'm with you, sheriff.
I'm not.
the diamond oven is shooting waves into the ground.
and rayl pressure waves can melt iron ore
in the rock strata.
melted rocks make magma,
and where the magma's under pressure
there's a volcano.
but who's cooking diamonds?
I talked to Dr. Zedler at the pensacola facility.
there are only six people in the world
who know how to make logic diamonds,
and they're all on his team.
all right, so they're all 3, 000 miles away from here?
Yes. Confirmed by D.O.D. security.
you think your people are gonna turn up something
from one of the other programs?
what other programs? You know. I don't know.
north korea, china.
Carter, no one else has a logic diamond program,
not even in the theoretical stages.
we are 30 years ahead of the world on this.
I gotta see your personnel files.
you spent three years in pensacola
while the neural core was being designed.
Dr. Zedler said you asked a lot of questions
about how to grow logic diamonds,
said you became a real expert.
you spend your entire career
creating something amazing,
and when you finally succeed, they just lock it all away.
are there any more diamond farms?
I only grew them because I didn't want to steal them.
don't you see?
these diamonds could change the world.
but the D.O.D. just wanted to use them to make better weapons.
G. D. is a science facility, not a weapons factory.
it's a top-secret lab.
I could never test my diamonds.
that's why I put them in the dogs.
to test them?
those dogs have
the most advanced neural processors around.
mimicking a biological organism is the best way
to test the diamonds
under real-world conditions.
I was helping out a few of the entrants.
I just built the diamonds into the circuits.
I had no idea they would overload.
or that you'd caused a volcano?
pardon?
even though we've shut down
the generator in the mine,
the seismic activity is continuing to increase.
that magma's under incredible pressure.
if it blows, eureka could be scattered over four states.
there could be thousands of casualties.
we should begin evacuation.
no, it could explode at any time.
I don't want people out on the street.
it'll be much safer if they're inside.
could you drill in and relieve the pressure?
you know,
just lance the puppy.
well, we have no idea where this puppy is.
thermal energy travels along the rock strata until it finds a pocket.
it could be anywhere.
wait a minute.
what if we cut a tunnel?
get close to the pocket, bore straight to the lake.
then use remote explosives
to fracture the containment rock.
that would divert the magma?
and we still have to find it.
well, you guys have got to have a gizmo
in this building that can help.
right? start knocking on doors.
just put a note in the elevator.
Yeah, carter,
there's no gizmo for sniffing out magma 2, 000 feet below the earth's surface,
but maybe we can get the director on that.
well, I'm not talking about sniffing
Or-I-I got an idea.
just tell me if it's incredibly stupid.
Yes.
is it possible?
this technology can help soldiers sniff out explosives.
we can fix Fifi to help us.
it's similar technology.
but real dogs can't sniff out magma.
if we reprogrammed her
and jacked up the sensitivity.
that would take weeks.
with this.
it's, uh, Dr. Mendel's artificial mucus.
it could supercharge Fifi's nose.
I think...
Fifi...
was born to be a hero.
heroine.
don't you?
smell the lava.
good girl. Smell the lava.
Oh, good girl!
smell the lava, right there.
good girl, good girl. Smell the lava.
good girl.
I hate to interrupt puppy school,
but the seismic pressure is building.
I think Fifi's almost ready,
although I don't think she's that thrilled
about carrying live explosives into a volcano.
I know, but you're gonna need them
to release the magma.
can't we just poke a hole in it,
relieve the pressure?
sure, if you want to be a charcoal briquette.
the magma's 3, 000 degrees.
it's gonna break through and fire down the tunnel
to the lake at 80 feet per second.
you want to be long gone when that happens.
all right. All right.
breaking through, bad. Running away, good.
got it.
all right, Fifi. let's go!
in you go!
all right, Fifi. Ready for this?
Yeah, she's got a new nose.
it's topped off with mucus.
Ready...to find...some lava.
it's not lava.
which way, girl?
here goes nothing.
Carter?
Nathan, what's the status down there?
I think carter's dog has us chasing our tails.
Fifi.
don't make me stop this tunneler, Fifi!
we have methane vents popping all over town.
nice, big ones!
still nothing.
Wait--wait, we might have something.
all right, Fifi.
come on, come on!
let's go find some lava.
magma.
it's magma.
it's lava when it's above ground,
magma when it's below.
what, you think I'm confusing the dog?
well, you're exhausting me.
we got heat.
all right, let's just set these explosives
right by the melt...
we're not gonna need them.
come here, Fifi. Come here!
magma's breaking through-- run!
Fifi!
didn't you say we should be long gone when this happens?
Yes, I did! drive, Carter, drive!
the pressure's dropping.
did you find something?
Oh, you could say that!
Hey, where's the lake?
I can't get a bearing.
these instruments are all over the place.
smack it.
Seriously? Smack it.
all right! I got a bearing.
turn right 15 degrees.
should be straight ahead.
should be?
next time, Fargo's driving.
they made it through.
so what do you want to do tomorrow?
Vincent, iced coffee, please.
on the way.
steamy out there tonight.
well, get used to it.
that magma's gonna be venting for days.
I think, technically, it's lava.
so you guys did good work today.
you should team up more often.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm thinking this town should buy you boys a drink.
well, you know,
it was kind of fun.
and besides almost dying, I can see why you miss it.
honestly, I don't.
I like the quiet life.
living with that kind of pressure
isn't for me anymore.
Hey, Carter, good driving today.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I'm the king of the world!
Hey, congratulations,
robot dog show champ.
thank you, thank you.
I'd like to thank everyone who made this possible.
mostly, myself.
Yeah, well, nothing like a gracious winner.
I gotta tell you.
he's absolutely amazing.
come here, buddy. Yeah.
it's so real.
I thought fake dogs don't, um...
Yeah, um, I'll see you later.
Oh, that's nice.
interested in a game?
Nah, I should go home and change my pants
because Fargo is a cheater.
Sparky? Aw.
well, you know, pressure can be a very destructive force.
did, uh, you ever finish
that troubling errand?
I certainly did.
how was thorne?
you're very perceptive, Jack.
I do know the type,
and they don't do good deeds.
she had me run a, uh
radiation survey outside of town.
now, have you ever heard
of baryogenetic radiation?
no.
well, that's because it doesn't exist.
it's only a theory.
at least I thought so... until today.
you found some?
just a trace.
Wh--great, great.
uh, is it dangerous?
I have all the data in my garage.
I'll run you through it tomorrow.
great. all right.
thanks... hey, Henry.
thanks for being on my side with this.
I do not keep secrets from my friends.
anymore.
sheriff carter, you planned to do aerobic exercise tonight
from 8: 00 to 9: 30, followed by bill paying.
Yeah, I'm taking the night off.
good idea.
stress is america's number one health problem.
Oh, drop dead.
followed closely by sarcasm.
Hey! You want some chips?
I was just gonna sit down and watch the game.
no, I had a powerbar at the library.
I'll see ya.
whoa, whoa, whoa. Where you going?
to study.
um, there's a physics quiz tomorrow
and, ugh, I really, really, really want to get an a.
okay.
just...do your best,
Thanks.
you need some help?
sure.
how much you know about calculating electron mass?
nothing.
but I do know that everything's a little easier if you're having some pizza.
so, um, sit down.
crack the books and I'll order.
okay.
I'm proud of you.
uh, extra mushrooms, right?
you know me so well.
awesome.
I have a new puzzle for you to solve.
this complex is massive.
Prewar. What, late '30s?
I believe.
that's before Eureka was built.
what's down there?
Mrs. Thorne, ever since you got to this town, you've been looking for something.
tell me what's going on.
no.
I have to what?
oversee the mayoral election.
this is the official polling place.
it's not a big deal, Carter.
well, now why can't Jo do it?
because Jo's not your lackey.
well, the town charter says that voting security falls on the highest ranking law enforcement officer.
that would be you.
unless you promote me or become otherwise incapacitated.
the mayor's seat has been open for over a year.
the town needs a voice.
this is a very important service card.
well, how important can it be?
I mean, my daughter's backing her 17-year-old boyfriend for the job.
Eureka doesn't discriminate.
some of our smartest citizens are teens.
so instead of working, I have to sit here and count ballots for some doogie mayor?
no, actually, your sister volunteered for that job.
um, it's a bad idea.
Lex becomes really obsessed with politics.
and her mood swings are already out of hand.
actually, she's really into it.
and you know what, you should be a little more sensitive.
your sister's pregnant.
I'm Mr. Sensitive. Like.
what--paper ballots?
digital voting machines are way too easy to tamper with.
and campaigns get really competitive around here.
okay.
I'll do it.
I'm--I'm - thank you.
Mr. Sensitive though.
Oh, my goodness.
what a beautiful baby.
love that shirt.
there we go.
uh, more vinspresso?
remember, vote Vincent.
you're doing great.
they love you!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I hate politics.
we're the glue that holds this town together, Vincent.
it's time we had a voice.
smile.
thanks - All right.
now back to kissing babies.
a vote for lucas is a vote for youthful innovation.
Oh, here's his ten point plan.
Kylie, can you help me pass out some more buttons, please?
then can we work on our lab project?
what's more important, Kylie, homework or changing the world?
I don't know, zoe.
I've never been much of a leader.
which is why you have me.
that baby face of yours promises idealism and hope for all the minors of the town.
and I am going to help you deliver it.
you mean manipulate it.
Tomay-to. Tomah-to.
sheriff Carter.
halo Herrera.
nephrologist, concerned citizen, and future mayor of Eureka.
well, you don't see that combo platter.
well, I'd like to talk to you about getting your endorsement.
I'm getting coffee.
Oh, hey, could - not your lackey.
well, um, I-- Mr. Herrera is it?
I would love to endorse somebody, but - but he's already promised his endorsement to my candidate, right, sheriff?
actually
Eureka needs a mayor who understands how a company town works.
Why? So your boss can have some global dynamics puppet to sell out the town?
I mean, how many people is thorne gonna fire?
which is why Vincent is the best candidate because he's out nurturing the community and
guys! I just want my coffee.
Vincent, get sheriff Carter a vinspresso on the house.
it's already on the house and bribery is a crime.
Yeah.
nice try, Fargo.
do we amuse you, Herrera?
watch and learn, kids.
folks, would everybody follow me outside?
I have something that will entertain and amaze you.
okay.
I'm done.
now can we talk about our project?
I've got some damage control to do here, Kylie.
why don't you just get it started?
but we're supposed to work together.
and we will after you've had a chance to show me what you've got.
so you're letting me take lead?
that's right.
now get to work, partner.
leave professional politics to the professionals.
told you it gets competitive.
that's just wrong.
big news, guys.
Yeah, what's up?
those ancient security cameras we saw in the bunker,
I pulled the negatives before thorne locked the place up again.
it's 35 millimeter.
we just have to find someone old enough to develop it.
what?
the latest next gen technology Zane's been developing for our sponsor.
over engineered to keep you cool in the hottest situations.
it's amazing what the greatest scientific minds and a big old corporate check can buy you.
too bad we can't buy the next mayoral election.
just kidding, Allison.
I would, however, like you to endorse Dr. Herrera.
well, won't that be seen as global dynamics taking sides?
maybe.
but on the other hand, having someone to smooth ruffled feathers during the next round of cutbacks isn't a bad idea.
well, I prefer to make up my own mind.
you should also think about what's best for global.
we need a personal relationship with the town.
one that shows that we're all on the same team.
are you and I on the same team, Eva?
of course.
I'd like to think we're also friends.
good.
so why don't you tell me what's in the bunker under tesla.
we found bariogenic radiation.
Zoe and her friends are very lucky that they weren't infected.
our first obligation is to the town.
excuse me.
make sure you vote.
this is Allison Blake.
I need some records from the archive.
what a time suck this is.
how did we live before digital?
I never knew you had an artistic side, Carter.
I'm a man of many facets.
check out the date stamp.
1939.0
I thought Eureka wasn't founded till 1950.
well, it wasn't.
what were they doing down here?
well, whatever it was, they tried to bury it for good.
look who we have here.
Sarah.Lights.
certainly, sheriff.
that was yesterday?
Thorne's been looking for something ever since she came to Eureka.
how much you wanna bet it's in this room?
what is she up to?
that's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.
the debate's about to begin.
you prepare your opening remarks?
what opening remarks?
hello.
is this on?
Hi, everyone.
uh, welcome to debate night.
uh, I'm sheriff Carter and I'll be
cut to the chase!
we want issues, not filler!
thank you, Lexi, for your wildly inappropriate enthusiasm.
so without further ado, I give you your candidates.
and if elected, I'll bring the same principles to the mayor's office as I do to cafe diem.
in short, you want it, I got it!
I promise to bring a voice to the pre-teen prodigy that the establishment too often sees as just another pretty brain.
times are changing and Rureka must change with it.
I will protect the tenets on which this town was founded and help usher in a new day for Eureka.
it's a new day all right.
just another day in Rureka.
well, it's a mini sun.
Really?
took you brainiacs all night to come up with that?
no. It took us all night to rule out any G. D. experiments as the cause.
so now we have two suns.
just like Tatooine.
Tatu-what?
geek speak.
the good news is it's stable holding its position at about 1, 000 feet.
so we're not lighting up the entire state.
Yeah, the last thing we need is a spotlight on the town the whole world can see.
well, agree.
but it's 6: 00 a. m. and 90 degrees.
how do we turn it off?
I'm not sure yet.
it has to be some kind of fusion reaction.
sounds dangerous.
no, not necessarily.
based on its containment, I'd--I'd say it's deliberate.
who'd want to make a second sun on purpose?
maybe the guy who was trying to make a big bang at the debates.
Eva wanted me to endorse him.
such a hidden agenda.
what do you mean?
um, zane found some security photos of her sneaking around the facility.
what's down there anyway?
well, nothing for long.
she ordered a thermal cleaning.
can--can we stop it till we get inside?
no, she's forbidden access.
the whole place is classified.
something's going on.
you go talk to Herrera.
I'll look into it.
Yes, Allison Blake.
she asked for me?
O--o--okay.
I'm on my way.
hot enough for you?
Yeah.
what's with the umbrellas?
he likes to be prepared?
did that just come from inside?
that would be yes.
Hey, sheriff.
you change your mind about that endorsement?
uh, not really.
what is this?
this is the end to drought, which we may be needing sooner than later.
welcome to my cloud farm.
cloud farm?
Yeah, that's-- that's what he said.
I'm taking cloud city to a whole new level with nanotech hydration.
cumulus, stratus, cirrus, I can create them all.
Oh, like you did with the--with the, uh, cloud gag yesterday.
nice, huh?
I found a way to hydrogenically infuse the atmosphere so I can literally sculpt clouds.
the commercial applications are limitless.
well, I'm--I'm more concerned about your sun stunt.
sun? No, no, no.
I'm strictly a cloud guy.
not that I don't mind the bump in the polling numbers.
people love a spectacle.
Yeah, but you have to admit the timing was suspicious.
have anyone from global come and review my record.
my life is an open book, sheriff.
I'm be holden to my constituents.
gotta admit, it's a hell of a show.
just the man I'm looking for.
save your breath, Fargo.
I already know who I'm voting for.
I'm offended. You think I'm only here to get your vote?
you're not? - No.
I also want a favor.
it is roasting out there.
a candidate has to project cool confidence under the most extreme conditions.
I hear through the grapevine you're beta testing something that can help with staying cool.
Yeah, I might be.
give me enough to get through the election and if--when Vincent wins,
I'll name a park bench after you.
tempting, but no.
I don't do politics.
but good luck with that.
based on these sun scans, I'd say your competition's definitely heating up.
I was testing the voting machines and I got dizzy.
I know you're not an obstetrician.
not really a fan of western medicine.
but I trust you.
well, I'm flattered.
I'm sure you have much bigger issues to deal with.
Yes, and I have people to deal with them.
so let's put your mind at ease.
so Carter says you've always been interested in politics.
he said I'm obsessed, didn't he?
no.
Jack thinks the system is broken.
but I think it's up to us to make the system work.
well, this little guy's system is working perfectly.
here. Want to take a look?
it's amazing.
what, is something wrong?
I think I figured out why your hormones are so out of whack.
you're getting a double dose.
Lexi, you're having twins.
both boys.
two sons?
two suns.
why didn't I think of that?
because it's crazy.
it's brilliant.
Lucas, I don't think you appreciate what's at stake here.
I mean, the mayor's office oversees city hall.
so?
so.
that includes the sheriff's department.
I mean, you could be my dad's boss.
and I thought he hated me now.
it's time to step up our game.
when the world hands you suns, make sunscreen.
iced mocha, folks.
stays cool as Vincent will be when he takes the oath of office.
suits?
it's over 100 degrees out here.
some candidates can handle the heat better than others.
nice gimmick.
we're just helping the voters stay refreshed so they can make a cogent decision at the polling booth.
Yeah, and we're just trying to protect voters from harmful UV rays so they won't be blinded by indecision.
iced mocha!
get it while it's cold.
sunscreen, people.
vote Lucas and say no to premature aging.
Zoe, I've had a small issue with our class project.
bigger priorities at the moment, Kylie.
here, grab a box.
no.
I think this is something you're really gonna want to see.
this better be good.
okay, Fargo, what's the big emergency?
the corruption of the democratic process.
everyone knows Herrera's in Thorne's pocket.
and now she's harassing my candidate.
look.
what are you talking about?
it's my wall of fame.
Thorne took it.
she redacted all the photos of Eureka's founders.
she just doesn't want the voters to see how connected Vincent is to this town's history.
why would she do that?
Why?
herrera checked out.
there's nothing in his background having to do with solar energy or fusion power.
great.
so we got two suns and no suspect.
and now apparently no air conditioning.
you get anything off Herrera?
other than a creepy politician vibe, no.
no, nothing. What did you find?
well, I ran some scans.
the sun has all the properties of a main sequence dwarf star.
the big question is its energy source.
well, I might be able to shed some light on that.
I ordered copies of all records having to do with the hidden facility under tesla.
now, of course, Eva's either had them redacted or they don't exist.
but she forgot one thing.
accounting.
Oh, somebody messed up their lunch receipt.
so I thought I'd see where they were spending in 1939.
check out the stuff they were ordering.
deuterium. Tritium.
these are heavy hydrogen atoms.
Yeah, and the essential elements in building fusion bombs.
so thorne dug up an old bomb testing facility?
Allison, we gotta get into that room before Thorne does her, uh, thermal cleaning thing.
to do what exactly?
to figure out whether something down there is causing what's up here.
hurry up.
it's over here.
Kylie, it's a billion degrees out.
I don't have time to play house.
excuse me.
I'm nine and I'm a junior.
I don't play house.
then what are we doing here?
take a look.
Kylie, can you remind me what our assignment was?
build a working model of the solar system.
took that a bit literally, did you?
how'd you get all the planets to orbit like that?
they are not the problem.
the sun's a little off.
we are so getting an A.
one small issue.
I can't make it stop.
so we're not getting an A?
Yeah, not so much.
you know what, a controlled fusion reaction like this takes real talent.
well, it wasn't even that hard.
take a gravitron field generator, surround it in a little reactor plasma, heat and serve.
served up kind of a big helping, don't you think?
well, we're a little off on the plasma density.
we?
Oh no, no, no.
see, I didn't do this.
um, and I'm gonna need you to resign from the campaign.
we can't afford the scandal.
thanks for the support, partner.
Henry, I got a town full of cranky people who need some sleep.
you got any ideas?
Yeah, make it do what it's supposed to do.
it should've started to dissipate by now.
well, it's--it's getting some fuel from somewhere.
chances are it'll-- it'll burn itself out.
but in the meantime, I'm gonna go back to my garage and research just how fast.
okay. Thanks. Let me know what you found.
can I come? I want to help.
Oh, I think you helped enough already today, don't you?
I tell you what, you can take atmospheric readings, okay?
great.
great.
so what convinced you?
Oh, Eva had all the old photos removed from cafe diem.
add that to the mass redaction of old G. D.Records
and making Jo shut down the eureka museum.
and having me and henry dig up this place.
they're all windows into eureka's past.
windows thorne seems to want shut.
let's find out why.
focus on our constituents.
no swag for seniors.
we're on a budget.
Hey, um, Kylie, look, about earlier.
you mean when you sold me out?
you made a second sun.
you told me to take the lead.
I was being nice.
like all politicians, you'll say whatever it takes to get what you want.
now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.
the radiogenic detection field reads negative for fusion products.
that good or bad?
it means we're not being radiated.
rats.
Oh no, that's definitely a good thing, Carter.
no, I mean, literally.
rats.
you got somethin' you want to say?
no.
okay, come on.
Henry said that the second sun was getting fuel from somewhere.
is it down here?
well, if it is, I'm not finding it.
I can't believe this place has been under us all these years.
it's like a door into Eureka's past.
look at this.
that's the door we saw in the security photos.
all right, let's unlock it.
my specialty.
how long do you need?
this long.
these old school locks are no match for a 20 zettahertz processor.
okay.
this is a bit of a let down.
why order a thermal cleaning of an empty room?
good point.
maybe it wasn't always empty.
can I see, uh, the light scanner thingy?
one biotelemetric dispersion scanner.
Yes. Okay. Coming up.
this baby reads patterns of movement left behind by organic materials.
all right, let's see who's been in here.
look at that.
the dust layer means that these prints are old.
but these high heels are definitely new.
so are the military boots.
looks like they were moving stuff out.
like what?
like them.
Oh, my god.
are those - bodies?
Carter, hand me the scanner.
these bodies were removed in the last 24 hours.
we have to find out who they were and what they were doing down here.
and why Thorne was trying to hide them.
this facility is classified and scheduled for thermal cleaning.
yet here you are violating direct orders.
I'd except this kind of insubordination from you, sheriff.
thank you.
but from you two.
I've always had a bit of trouble with authority.
as far as I'm concerned, this just became an active crime scene.
Oh, this is out of your jurisdiction, sheriff.
I'd be happy to have the D. O.D.
remind you of that.
and I'd be happy to tell them why.
you trying to bluff me?
no, he's not because he's leaving.
we all are.
no, actually.
we're not.
Carter, we crossed the line.
let's not make it any worse.
you sure about this?
sorry.
okay.
I can't believe allison backed down.
Yeah, me neither.
now Thorne has all the evidence.
I wouldn't say all the evidence.
I yanked the data chip from the dispersion scanner before they took my stuff.
we can see images of everything we scanned.
nice.
that's definitely not good.
Really?
based on my initial data, it should've burned itself out hours ago.
that doesn't look like it's burning out.
it looks like it's getting hotter.
I'm melting.
it's midnight and 110 in the shade.
people are getting pretty testy.
Yeah, me included.
it reminds me of tornado weather.
I have a really bad feeling about this.
well, um, just keep everybody calm and preferably indoors.
Roger that.
kylie is gathering atmospheric data.
I should know something soon.
all right.
Zane's working on it too.
and in the meantime, thorne's wiping out any evidence that connects her to these bodies.
any idea who they were?
I'm getting conflicting information.
how so?
from the surveillance photos, their approximate age is somewhere between 35 and 45 when they entered the room in 1939.
all right. With you so far.
the organic residue that you scanned establishes that they also died in 1939.
so they were buried there for 70 years?
Yeah, well, here's the really puzzling thing.
common sense says they were around 40 when they died.
but based on these readings, their biological age is somewhere around 80.
I want someone posted outside that facility at all times.
nobody comes in until after the thermal cleaning.
let's get the bodies ready for transport.
transport?
to where?
I'm afraid that's classified information, Allison, as is everything in this room.
and I'd really appreciate it if you leave now.
you said that you considered us to be friends.
I do too.
so why don't you just tell me who those men are?
I know what it looks like from where you stand, but it's not what you think.
these were good men who gave their lives for this town.
and it could've been prevented.
you make it sound as if you knew them.
it's time for you to go now.
why are you doing this?
because I have to.
Dr. Deacon, there's something I think you're really gonna want to see.
well, please tell me you didn't make another sun.
no, I've been trying to figure out how to extinguish the first one.
you mean the second one.
semantics?
really, sheriff?
could we just-- what?
Kylie, what did you find?
well, I've been doing readings all over town and the upper air is saturated with excess hydrogen.
is that bad?
well, uh, not by itself.
but mixed with Kylie's project,
well, how whopping are we talking?
well, depending on the source and how much is left, big.
look, I don't know where this hydrogen is coming from but I promise I didn't do it.
that's okay.
I have a pretty good idea who did.
there's no way my clouds caused this.
well, it's not the clouds themselves.
it's what's inside of them.
there's a lot--it's a whole lot of hydrogen, right?
well, not that much.
maybe 1, 000 liters at standard temperature and pressure.
well, you've been outside.
it's plenty.
how was I supposed to know someone'd be creating a stellar fusion reaction in their club house?
hello.
you live in Eureka.
I guess this means I won't be getting your endorsement.
well, it's-- just stick to the problem.
is this how you deliver the nanos to make your clouds?
Yep.
a single stage booster that fuels the cold accelerant mixer for better saturation and heat dispersion.
nice.
we gotta fix this.
can you reverse it?
you mean exsanguinate the excess hydrogen from eureka's lower atmosphere?
Yes.
no.
I mean, I can make any shape you want, but once the clouds have seeded, natural hydration processes take over.
I say we enjoy the extra sunlight while we can.
it'll burn itself out soon enough.
you were saying?
it should've extinguished itself.
but it didn't.
that's because Kylie's sun-- ingenious though it is
has evolved from a dwarf star and is developing into a red super giant.
uh, which means?
instead of burning out, it's blowing up big time.
not my fault entirely.
and it's not stopping there.
the sun flares are just the beginning.
and we only have a few hours before it goes critical.
okay, what are our options?
if we can get close enough to launch a dispersion module, a concentration of iron atoms fired directly into the sun's core should cause it to implode.
and imploding's a good thing?
Yes. Once the sun's incapable of fusion reaction, then, uh, we'll all be safe.
what if it doesn't work?
we all get front row seats to a supernova way bigger than hiroshima.
and Eureka becomes a mile deep crater.
that's too risky.
we need to evacuate now.
Jo's already started.
but this is also the most advanced research complex on the planet and we have an opportunity to save it.
and I'm already developing a compound to trigger the implosion.
and I'm working on a delivery system.
towns can be rebuilt.
people can't.
which is why we're evacuating the people while we're trying to save the town.
we're multitasking.
sheriff, you might be comfortable risking lives, but I'm not.
make sure everybody gets out while there's still time.
Eva, we have a chance to save decades of research.
that wasn't a request.
it's like she wants to see the place go up in flames.
I think she might.
well, what now?
let's go, people!
move! Move!
shuttles are waiting outside.
let's go!
you know, Jo, after the election, we'll have quite the influence around here.
maybe I can up your pay rate.
don't make me use the stun gun.
you heard her, Fargo.
keep moving.
everybody move.
but we're just making sure his constituents are safely away first.
how come you two aren't drenched like the rest of us?
Oh, a worthy candidate is always cool under pressure, sheriff.
and it's classified.
however, I could be convinced to share my secret for, say, your endorsement.
this is mine.
both of you on the bus.
go.
everybody move!
keep going!
sounds like we're using sunscreen to beat injustice.
just smile and look pretty.
Zoe, what are you doing?
you gotta go.
guys, please.
not yet.
latest election polls only show Lucas down by two points.
Lucas, you want to score points with the voters or with your girlfriend's old man?
no contest, sir.
that'll work.
vote Lucas!
all right, everybody's cleared out.
any luck?
we're locked and loaded, sheriff.
XRT online and ready.
it'll take two people to get the module in position for launch.
I can do that on my own.
no.
I'll go with you. I know this baby best.
okay. All right.
you three get to an evacuation site.
and Kylie, nice work.
Thanks.
be careful.
Thanks.
Hey, could you keep an eye on, uh, lex and zoe?
of course.
just come back safely.
Thanks.
all right, we're at a safe distance from town.
we can move everyone quickly if we need to, but with ten evac camps for 2, 600 people.
things are gonna get crowded.
how are you feelin'?
I just wish someone would do something about the heat.
I hear your pain.
this town needs a mayor who can be cool in a crisis.
and if I'm elected, I promise I won't sleep until darkness falls again on eureka.
Oh, please.
you don't need stale campaign promises.
you need ideas that are fresh as baked bread, which by the way, vincent also provides twice daily.
say no to half-baked science and overbaked bread.
Lucas is your man.
he can't bake his way out of a paper bag.
Oh yeah, like cloud makers.
what is wrong with all of you?
Eureka was founded to protect the greater good.
you're worried about votes.
you should be worried about lives.
you cannot be a leader if there is no town to lead.
so I suggest you get your priorities straight.
that was beautiful.
having fun yet?
Oh yeah, cause driving headlong into a fiery death is everybody's idea of a good time.
sometimes I think it's his.
Carter, could we have a minute?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sure.
Jo, you're supposed to be miles away at an evac camp by now.
I should risk my life more often.
I prefer you didn't.
come on, Josefina, don't go all serious on me now.
it's too late.
sheriff.
I thought we agreed to evacuate.
we did.
so what are you still doing here?
none of your business.
don't play games.
I'm not.
I think Zane's device is going to work.
probably.
if you don't die first.
that is part of the job.
and the men in that bunker would know that.
sheriff, whatever it is you think you know about what you found or about me, it's wrong.
maybe.
but I'm just getting started.
if there's one thing I've learned in life is that nobody should be left behind, no matter what the reason.
and that includes you.
Mrs. Thorne, I'm duty bound to enforce this evacuation.
Jo, make sure she gets out of town safely.
and no, that's not a request.
that looks pretty bad.
you sure the rocket can handle it?
and untested delivery system aimed at an out of control mini sun.
what could go wrong?
ready?
it's fried.
call Allison.
okay, carter, what's wrong?
it's Zane's module. The electronics are fried.
do you have any spares lying around?
okay, G.D. has plenty of short range booster assemblies.
we just need to adapt them to the XRT's specifications.
we'll never make it back in time.
there is another way.
Dr. Herrera's hydrogen seeding device.
it uses similar boosters to the XRT.
but my greenhouse is too close to that sun.
and there's no way they'll ever survive the heat.
well, hold on.
maybe there is.
what are you thinking?
well, like Fargo said earlier.
we just need to stay cool under pressure.
I've been working on this heat protection formula for weeks.
sure that'll work?
it's a prototype.
but it's overengineered to respond to increased body heat and adrenaline.
well, taking on a supernova so we should have plenty of both.
all you gotta do is slather it on.
we should have a good 10, maybe 15 minutes before we combust.
fantastic.
we're getting awful close.
then why are you slowing down?
I'm not.
you smell burning rubber?
we're gonna have to run for it.
dude, it's like 2 zillion degrees out there.
okay, I'm game.
you do anything normal for fun?
I play a wicked game of yahtzee.
put that gel on thick if you know what's good for ya.
you ready?
I feel like a lobster in here.
temp's climbing.
if we stay long, we'll boil.
find the rocket.
it might help if I could see anything.
keep looking!
got it!
got it!
Yep!
right!
no.
this way.
Yeah.
and.
set.
I know. We only get one shot at this.
I don't want to miss.
using GPS to target?
I was gonna eyeball it.
Oh, stellar.
uh, Carter, whatever happens, it's been fun.
no, it hasn't.
push the button.
take a look at that, huh?
that is quite a sunset.
so you managed to pull it off.
you sound disappointed.
someone cancelled the thermal cleaning.
I wonder who.
you may have the backing of the D. O.D.But these people still work for me.
and you work for me.
not without an explanation.
those bodies - are my concern.
you're asking me to trust you, but you're giving me nothing.
well, I'll give you some advice.
history has a way of haunting you no matter how far you run.
this is part of mine and I'm putting it to rest.
so you stay out of my way.
Hey.
listen, um, whoever wins, it was nice doing battle with you.
after all this, I don't even care who wins anymore.
Yeah.
as long as one of us buries that guy.
Amen to that.
Hey, partner.
thanks for the save.
fiery death not popular with voters.
I caused it.
it's the least I could do.
it was my fault too.
I got so caught up in everything when I should've been helping you.
I'm sorry.
this time I'll make it up to you.
this time?
well, we have to make a new model.
and someone should make sure I don't destroy the universe.
so.
partners?
glad to see you're okay.
me too.
look, a--about before - it's cool, Jo.
it was a crisis.
you were caught up in the moment.
no, I-I-I wasn't.
sheriff.
so how's the.
itchy.
hope that means it's healing well.
listen, what, uh, you and Zane did was a brave-- mythic.
maybe selfish.
I'm growing attached to the town.
well, this town, you know, is fortunate to have you to protect it.
well, I'm just doing my job.
and, um, Thorne?
I'm working on it.
may I have your attention, please?
scuse me.
scuse me.
everyone, can I have your attention, please?
everyone.
Hello!
quiet!
thank you.
okay.
all the ballots are in.
it was a very close race.
but after a late night surge at the polling booths, our new mayor elect is.
Mr. Henry deacon.
No!
no.
Yes!
Seriously?
um, no.
no, wait.
I wasn't even on the ballot.
I kinda started a write-in campaign.
and, uh, someone gave you their official endorsement.
you're welcome.
I-I-I don't know.
what to say.
say that you'll take the job because Zoe's boyfriend is the runner up.
clearly this is a-- a surprise.
I'm not one for making campaign promises.
but, um, I will say this.
what makes Eureka special is not the ideal behind it, but you.
this community.
this family that I'm very proud to be a part of.
and it's this family that I promise to protect no matter what.
thank you.
see.
sometimes the system does work.
come on, Josephine don't go all serious on me now.
it's too late.
Thorne dug upan old bomb-testing facility?
what's down there anyway?
nothing for long, she ordered a thermal cleaning.
she redacted all the photos of Eureka's founders.
Oh, my god, are those...
bodies?
history has a way of haunting you.
this is part of mine, and I'm putting it to rest, so you stay outta my way.
so...
party at Pilar's tonight?
doubtful. My morning shift felt like a double.
in fact, I'm about as energetic as this dish rag.
which is why you need some fun.
I'll just, uh, I will just sit here till you are finished.
why do dads ruin everything?
cause they're men, and men are ruiners.
uh, Zane drama?
fear.
okay, never date a coward.
I put myself out there, commitment-wise, and he froze.
we haven't talked since.
well, here's your chance.
Hey, Jo.
you, uh, eat yet?
I-I thought maybe we could, you know, we could eat a bite.
a bite.
you got something to say?
I already did.
and you couldn't handle it.
Hi, ruiner.
you know, if we're ever gonna find out why Thorne moved those bodies, we're gonna have to search the bunker.
stopping a thermal cleaning didn't slow her down.
she's pulled in an outside contractor.
what kind of outside contractor?
I'm not sure. His name is Hendrix.
he's set himself upin a trailer near the bunker.
that's all I could find out.
and she's moving those bodies.
we have to autopsy those bodies in order to discover their cause of death and I. D.
well, I.D.'Ing them is gonna be difficult.
even the ones that were on that wall.
why would anybody want photos of scientists and founders of Eureka?
well, we're never gonna know without those photos.
or a...photo of a photo.
Hey, Vince.
remember the day of the campaign speeches?
you were taking photos in front of that wall, right?
Yeah, you mean the ones where I look like sasquatch?
Yes! Those are the ones.
Thanks. I think Fargo has them.
great. Um...okay. I'll talk to Fargo.
I'll get Jo to check on Thorne's guy.
and, Allison, we have to have those bodies.
okay.
all right, Dr. Hendrix, you sure you have enough material?
trust me, Miss Thorne. I'm very good at what I do.
that's why I called you in.
how long before everything's in place?
as long as it takes.
look, this bunker is massive,
I'll be happy to give you any help you need.
this isa delicate operation.
I would preferto do it myself.
we only have one shot.
take it quickly.
Dr. Hendrix, it's the police.
I need to speak with you.
Thanks, Carter. That was pointless.
ha. Found you.
how'd you get here?
I rode my bike.
and just so you know, this passive-aggressive thing is really annoying.
you wanna try just aggressive?
uh, no.
not really.
I didn't think so. See ya.
Hey, could you come here for a second?
Why? So you can hit me with that?
well, not until you tell mewhat it is first.
please?
anodized aluminum with a trap valve.
okay.
and that means...
it's a pressurized containerof some kind.
it's got a remote trigger.
for what?
to set it off at a distance.
you wouldn't want to be anywhere
you could pack a hell of a lot of something
how much could you pack? Some of us actually work for a living, you know.
Yeah, I didn't wanna do this on the G. D. System.
well, you owe my lunch hour.
and you mind turning around?
I have some personal photos on here.
all right, let's see.
Ooh! Not it.
Ooh, not it.
not it.
Ooh, definitely not it.
that's a good one.
what about personal don't you understand?
all right. Okay, here we go.
great. Um, can you zoom in on the photos
not on this dinosaur.
and since I can'tdo it at G. D.
fargo, this is important.
you're gonna have to go home now.
Dr. Blake won't like me bending the rules like this.
Ah, you'd...be surprised.
Oh, great.
ms. Thorne wanted me to double check the delivery addresson the shipment from the morgue.
one sec.
great. Thanks.
I'll never make fun of aunt Lexi again.
I feel like I'm pregnant with twins.
Oh, don't ever say the "p" word in front of your dad.
he'll lock me up and throw away the key.
I feel like he's always watching me.
if I weren't so tired,
I'd tell you stop being so paranoid.
unidentified intruder.
see? Always watching.
initiating detention procedure.
Aah!
Zoe and I walked in and S. A. R. A. H. Went insane.
because the unidentified intruder is not Zoe.
system off!
manual override engaged.
honey, you okay?
I think so.
did you set a trap for Lucas?
no. There's just something wrong with S. A. R. A. H.
Yeah, what's wrong is living in a house that can taser you.
Yeah.
no, she didn't hurt me.
I just got really dizzy.
well, I think you should go to the infirmary.
no, dad, really, I'm fine.
I've just been run down.
it's no big deal.
is S. A. R. A. H. dead?
Mm...
uh, no, we just powered her down.
Fargo's gonna run a full system check.
and Zoe and I are gonna go to cafe diem till he figures out why she turned on us.
okay.
you sure you're okay?
are you sure you didn't zap my boyfriend?
Ahh...she's fine.
nice job getting those bodies out of G. D.
Yeah, uh, you know that eva's gonna be able to track your I. D. off that scanner.
which is why we need to hurry.
all right, let's find out about our friends.
ho, ho, you all right?
um...
since when are you the squeamish sort?
I'm not, I'm just, um...
I'm just worn out.
really, I'm fine.
let's just get started.
that one's almost empty,
it's some kind of cement.
well, so you know what Hendrix is doing with about a thousand of 'em?
no idea.
why don't you ask him?
and while you're at it, find out why it has a remote trigger.
there's also a manual release.
I see.
I'm stuck.
Yeah. We're stuck.
together.
I'll find Hendrix.
thank you.
perfect.
Hi.
uh, busy day?
Yeah, yeah.
there's not much time to talk.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Oh, uh, sheriff Carter.
I thought accessdown here from the highway was supposed to be blocked.
Yeah, I had to take the scenic route.
okay. Is there something I can help you with, sheriff?
well, it's just thatI don't know you, and you've--you've closed down a road, this is an authorized military operation.
y-yes, I know, authorized by Eva Thorne.
I-I know.
look, you seem like a really nice guy, but I can't tell you anything.
fair enough.
how 'bout I tell you things then?
there's an abandoned underground facility.
you're loading in about a thousand canisters of that stuff, and all with America's sweetheart behind it.
you're very perceptive.
she's a piece of work, that one.
but I think she's gonna take a few pieces outta me if I tell you what I'm doing.
okay. Um...
could you tell me when you're gonna be done doin' it?
just so I know when the road's gonna be clear.
Oh, yeah, I think we'll be done end of work day tomorrow.
great. Thanks.
Oh, um...one more thing.
wh-what if someone made the very understandable mistake of, um, opening one of the canisters...
and then someone else got their feet caught in your super goo?
it's called instantanium.
it's a nano-polymersyntactic foam.
you know what that means?
uh...
well, no.
but, uh, how do weget 'em out?
you get a saw.
great. So you can just cut through it.
no. You, uh, cutthrough their legs.
Ah!
Yes.
son of a...
don't you look at me in that tone of voice.
this isn't my fault.
okay.
Dr. Bonehead's lab.
let me guess--you two are still stuck together.
just tillI can reach my gun.
What'd you find out from Hendrix?
it's called instantanium, some sort of hardening foam.
no, uh...nano...lastic foam.
Nano-polymer syntactic foam?
Yes!
Wow.
what, wow?
Nanoparticlesare bound together at a molecular level.
did Hendrix have any idea how to get out of it?
uh, one, but you're not gonna want to try it.
I've slept in tee-pees, huts, yurts...
I'd take a bed of nails right now.
okay, I know why I'm tired. I'm sleeping for the boys.
what's your excuse?
I think I'm coming down with something.
every bone in my body aches.
is this what it feels like to be 30?
okay, I'll forgive you for that in 15 years.
you do look a little pale.
Hey. Smart house is up and running.
everything's fine.
for the house that occasionally takes you hostage?
it was an honest mistake.
Zoe's DNA didn't match the sample on S. A. R. A. H.'s data base.
well, it's not like I went out and changed it.
well, maybe it wasa memory glitch.
either way, I reset her, and it won't happen again.
so we get to sleep in real beds now? Yep.
with real pillows?
you're all set for the house.
Oh, and tell your dad it took me a while to enhance them, but I am a photoshop god, so I got those old pictures he wanted.
I love old pictures.
the sheriff was interested in which ones?
he has this one with Mickey Mantle, and I always promised I'd get it restored, so...
Thanks, Fargo. I'll pick 'em up later.
okey.
so can I buy yousome ice cream?
I'm pressed for time now.
Oh, you're checking on that Hendrix guy down in the bunker.
that's a big job you gave him.
that's classified.
Yeah, that's what he said.
he said it's some part of some big military project.
that's right.
Oh, and I checked with Mansfield, and he said that it isn't a big military project.
you spoke to the general?
Yeah, he usually doesn't take my calls, but I used your name, and he picked right up.
it was awesome. I hope you don't mind.
I mind just about everything you do, sheriff, especially when you stick your nose into somebody else's business.
well, dead bodiesare always my business.
anyway, the general says hi, and he can't wait to be briefed about the underground facility.
seems he didn't even know a thing about it.
well, apparently, he does now.
Yeah.
ms. Thorne,
I'm just looking for the truth.
sometimes the truth needs to be left alone.
but you've made that impossible now, haven't you, sheriff?
Yes, I have.
Henry, tell me you found something.
Yeah, I found something all right.
these men did not die of natural causes.
awesome!
uh, not for them...
well, definitely not for them.
their death was accelerated brutally.
rapid aging.
every cell in their body went through an entire life cycle in a compressed period of time.
something was introduced to their system that killed them in a month.
you think they were poisoned?
could be. I don't know.
I'm trying to identify the elemental base of the pathogen.
it's something I've never seen before.
look at that-- 40 to 90 in a month.
now, does that look natural to you?
Henry, if you can prove that they didn't die of natural causes, then I can investigate.
and if I can investigate, then I can stop Thornefrom sealing the bunker.
I can try. All right.
God, what if I have to go to the bathroom?
why do you think I'm working so fast?
I had four cups of coffee this morning.
this isn't so bad.
Hey, guys. You got a china pattern yet?
no, wait, hold on.
I need jo for a second.
I'm kind a busy right now, and that means that...
my job is less important than yours?
well, that depends. Can you do it with one leg?
good times.
I have an array of exotic flavors for you to choose from.
I chose them specifically based on the regions you've traveled.
the fact that a house can actually try to suck up to me is almost as disturbing as a housetaking my niece hostage.
I'm still indicating that her DNA has changed.
aunt Lexi?
great. Just when she's finally getting some sleep.
yeah? Here.
aunt Lexi, are you there?
Yeah, I'm right here.
are you okay?
there's something wrong with my eyes.
I can't see.
all clear. No one left inside.
good.
you really know how to work a man.
so I've been told. Everything set?
this place will bean instantanium fortress
every entrance 5 feet thick with the stuff.
now, the facility itself will stay clear like you asked.
with you rushing me, though,
I can't promise a smooth detonation.
Meaning?
look, an underground job like this needs to be calibrated precisely so the geological foundation of the place isn't disturbed.
now moving the operation a day up on me...
you might feel a few little quakes.
you sure it'll be impossible to open once it's triggered?
nothing breaks my instantanium.
thank you, Dr. Hendrix. I'll take it from here.
well, you're not going back in there.
I just have a few things to take care of.
if Hendrix seals the facility before we get a warrant, we're screwed.
it's a big place. There's gotta be a weak spot.
guys, can I just get my...
exactly, so if we find out where it is and protect it... we can get in later.
can we just...
okay, take a closer look right over here, right?
there's an air shaft just there.
I think it goes down to the second level.
cataracts are easy to get rid of nowadays especially with our, our prototype.
she's gonna be as good as new.
Wow. You're gonna be ableto see again soon.
how did this happen? S.A.R.A.H.'s lasers.
really bad for the eyes. Can I talk to you for a second?
sure. Sure.
it wasn't lasers, Henry.
you get cataracts when you're old, not when you're 17. Yes.
tell me it doesn't have anything to do with how those three men died.
S.A.R.A.H. was right.
Zoe's DNA has changed.
every cell in her body is beginning to age rapidly.
now, if she has the same thing as those men, there's only one place she could have gotten it.
the bunker.
Yes.
okay, um...
she hurt her ankle when she was down there.
she slippedin some purple liquid. Could that be it?
I need a sample.
alright, I'll get you a sample.
you mind staying with her?
sure, listen, G.D.'s done a lot of work on arresting cell degeneration.
I've even put a team together.
so try not to worry.
Yeah.
sheriff, I have that picture
now's not a good time.
no, no, you need to see this.
that's impossible.
well, sometimes impossible answers a lot of questions.
Don't...touch the pretty metal canisters.
sheriff? You need to get out of here now.
sure.
if you tell me what's going on.
what?
that stuff you're trying to hide...
it killed those three men, and now Zoe's been exposed.
that's not possible.
she slipped in it when she was lost down here.
now it's changedher DNA.
my god.
if that's true, we've gotta get out of here as fast as we can.
Nice...try.
but I spoke to Hendrix.
he's not sealing this place until tomorrow.
no, no! You called Mansfield.
I had it accelerated.
we've gotta get to the air shaft!
that was our only way out.
crap.
so you knew this was gonna happen.
why are you down here?
I wanted to end it. All of it.
including me.
I should have done it a long time ago, but I didn't have the courage.
what are you talking about?
courage to...
what? To...to...
courage...
to cover up how those men died.
Yeah.
what did you do to them?
I didn't do anything to them.
they died 70 years ago.
I wasn't even born.
well...
try again.
this is one of the pictures you took out of cafe diem...
that's you.
you were here in 1939 with them.
I was.
but I didn't hurt them.
I just couldn't help them.
s-so...
I'm 107 years old.
why didn't you die like them?
I don't know.
I'm the only one.
well, now you have a chance to fix this.
I mean, Zoe's not lucky like you.
she's like them, and she's gonna suffer unless you tell me everything that you know!
I know, but we're stuck here.
well, I'm not dead yet, and neither are you.
so we're gonna find a way.
we're not letting Zoe die.
here ya go.
Wow. Good eats in this town.
glad you think so.
you'll be staying a while longer.
we set off the first atomic bomb here.
n-no, first atomic bomb was, uh...
Los Alamos?
they learned from our mistakes and went with plutonium.
we used a rare element found only in certain meteorites.
the first test was flawless.
but it created a certain...
unique by-production the blast chamber.
the, uh, purple stuff.
the--the stuff Henry couldn't identify.
element X.
they asked the team to study it.
there were only four of us exposed.
but nobody knew its effects until it was too late.
So...why did they ageand you didn't?
DNA hadn't even been discovered yet.
but Jimmy knew that, genetically,
I was one in a million.
sorry. Jimmy is...
Perkins. He was the team leader.
along with Blackman and Ross.
and you.
well, I was a lab assistant.
the best a girl could hope for in those days.
but Jimmy insisted that I keep my exposure a secret...
so I wouldn't have to do what they did.
bury themselves down here.
Yes. They locked it all away.
the element. The whole project.
and they were so close to a cure.
how do you know that?
I read their paperwork.
they worked on it every day for the rest of their lives.
28 days.
2-28 days?
Zoe was exposed to this stuff seven days ago.
this place is amazing.
you got the right dissolving chain here, but you're gonna need francium 227ac, and there's less than an ounce of that on earth.
Yeah, except for the stash here at G. D.
you're kidding, right?
I'll order it up.
but we'll only be able to make up a few milligrams.
we're getting a series of small earthquakes around the underground facility.
any idea why?
Hey, I told her that would happen if she rushed the job.
you mean you've already sealed it?
Yeah, about an hour ago.
Oh, Carter...
I put all their papers in here.
what am I looking for?
notes, papers, journals.
anything that can help Henry save Zoe.
Hitler was already marching across Europe.
imagine if he'd gotten his hands on our bomb research.
Oh, there'd be volkswagens everywhere.
so why come back?
why not just keep it all hidden?
I tried to move on, have a life.
but things changed for women.
I made something of myself.
fate catches up with you...
no matter how far you run.
I did so well,
I became the best personfor the job at G. D.
I've spent a lifetime trying to forget this place.
I needed to know.
because your name isn't Eva Thorne.
it's Mary Perkins.
Jimmy was my brother.
if I had known that Zoe would have found her way down here,
I never would have opened this place up again.
don't worry about it. We're gonna help her.
well, even if wefind the cure, we can't get out of here.
well, you believed in your team.
I believe in mine.
so next step, we need some of that liquid.
well, there's a storage pool in the cooling chamber.
great. Follow me.
this solvent might work.
just fyi--there's a chance of a slight explosion.
no, wait--explosion?
just do it.
thank god!
Oh, look, it worked. You're free!
Yes, in another five minutes,
I would have chewed off my own leg!
your mouth is probably big enough.
how much longer, Fargo?
the bunker's computers are 70 years old.
it's like teaching Lincoln how to use an iphone.
just get us a signal down there.
we need to know if Carter's okay.
easier said than done.
how's Zoe?
uh, tired, but stable.
I was able to identify the DNA marker that that purple element affects.
I just need more of it so that I can test a reversal process.
but there is gonna come a point of no return, where her body won't be able to bounce back from whatever aging she's already experienced.
Henry, listen, I have been feeling exhausted, not your normal kind of tired.
I was down there, too, you know.
well, then, I want you tested.
this room would have been buried if you hadn't cutthe wire.
Yeah. What is all this stuff anyway?
it was too dangerous to enter the cooling chamber.
so we had a video system installed to monitor the liquid level.
we were working with atom bombs for the first time, so we didn't want the radiation to seep into the groundwater.
is, is thisthe storage pool?
Yes.
it looks like the instantanium's has cracked the base of the storage pool.
it's leaking out underneath.
if it reaches the groundwater and gets into the Eureka drinking system...
Eureka's gonna get very old...very fast.
even if we do make it out of here, Henry doesn't have any purple stuff to make a cure.
we need to save your daughter.
Yes.
we do.
I've had this for a long time.
my brother thoughtI might need it one day.
Zoe needs it more.
what about you?
I'd rather save somebody now than hold onto it for a lifetime.
we have to figure out how to get it outta here.
look, I know this wasa rush job, but I did seal the entire facility.
well, every fortifie dposition has its weak point.
I'm thinking yours is down at the bottom of that ventilation shaft.
you might know that, but how does Carter know that?
we looked at the same schematic.
when two people really know each other, then they're in sync, and when they're partners
I get it.
could you just drive the car, please?
I can't believe this shaft was here all along.
Yeah, labeled on every map as a capped well.
why are we still in this room?
I think it's our best bet.
no offense, sheriff, but nobody has any idea what's going on down here.
Lupo and I looked at the same plans.
we identified the same weak points, and this was the weakest.
that's why you tried to clear all the canisters in this room.
Yeah, but I missed one.
one canister or not, that material's invulnerable.
so everyone keeps telling me.
do you... hear something?
good afternoon!
my name is Joe Lupo, and I'll be savingyour ass today.
someone oughta promote you.
so how is she?
she's hanging in there.
well, Henry's pulled uphalf the departments at G. D.
and Eva's doing everything she can to help.
great.
the solution that Henry's working on
we're all gonna need it soon.
so it made it into the groundwater?
our monitors registered contamination in over a million acre-feet of the aquifer.
you guys are lucky you don't have a boss.
otherwise, he'd come down here, he'd kick your-- Allison Blake.
where is she?
Eva Thorneis currently aiding Dr. Deacon in trying to get a dangerous situation under control.
you said Eva Thorne is the dangerous situation with bodies, and underground facilities, and cover-ups.
Yeah, sir, the situationhas changed since I called you.
Yes. It's gotten worse.
you've allowed a breach of security in a deactivated facility turn into a potential town-wide catastrophe.
I want you to arrest her.
sir, it's imperative that thetesting of Eva Thorne continue.
well, you can test her after she's been arraigned.
sir, on a personal note, my daughter was exposed to whatever stuff that is down there, and the testing can help her.
but we need to do it now.
all right.
when this is over, Thorne belongs to me.
thank you.
we're hoping to create a counter-reaction using non-baryogenic radiation to counter the baryogenic radiation that she was exposed to.
it's, uh, like using x-rays to treat cancer.
it'll work. It has to.
Well...we'll know in a few hours.
I can't.
it took all of Thorne's sample just to make enough for Zoe.
I know my brother would have been working right up to the end trying to find a way to neutralize the element.
all I can find here are designs for some kind of a bomb--a big bomb.
they spent their last days on earth working on a dooms day weapon?
not my brother. He was looking for a solution.
maybe the bomb was the solution.
does it say anywhere that the bomb created a lot of, uh, non, uh, bary
non-baryogenic radiation? Yes.
Yeah, they were talking20, 30 kilotons.
that's enough to irradiateten square miles.
could that fix the town?
well, a range like that would certainly reachthe aquifer.
I mean, it might work.
sure, if they actually built the thing.
it doesn't say how far they got.
well, they had a month.
they wouldn't have wasted the time.
sure this is the right room?
the only peak on our particle scan is located 12 feet directly behind you.
signal's hot. I think I'm close.
is there anything down there?
Yep.
a really big bomb.
so how far did they get? Pretty far.
time to finish what they started.
give me a couple hours and I'll let you know.
all right, baby, all you have to do is neutralizea radioactive water table and we're good.
the bomb's primed and ready to go.
it's hot-wired into the timing circuits down here.
great work, Zane.
that wasn't me. It was all Jimmy.
it's set up so you can start the countdown remotely.
as soon as you're clear.
okay.
just got one more thing to do.
we've evacuated the area above the facility.
are you sure there's enough instantanium left to handle a nuclear blast?
cause if it shatters, all the force will go up, not down.
it'll never reach the aquifer.
but it will reach us.
I told youI double-covered that area.
your little firecracker won't even make a dent.
it's fascinating, you know.
you've created a problem so big the solution is to detonatean atomic bomb.
I know, right? How cool is that?
should I...
come with you guys?
automated countdown sequence initiated.
detonation in...
the sensor's into the water table.
it'll take a few seconds to get the reading.
and let us know if we're all gonna die.
pretty much.
well, no matter how it turns out...
it's been a fun day.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, I guess it was.
Oh, nice to end the relationship on a high note.
so what's the verdict?
the explosion's completely neutralized the baryogenic radiation in the aquifer.
the groundwater's safe.
well, good for us.
I, uh,
I should, uh, call Allison.
Yeah.
Hey, um, after that call, if you, um, maybe wanna gofor a, you know, break-up dinner?
no.
how 'bout a...a make-up dinner instead?
guess it's not so bad being stuck together.
Allison Blake, please.
Hi.
Hey, Jack.
I'm really glad I came to stay here.
and I'm glad uncle Jack is gonna be around for the boys.
me too.
if you guys hug, I know I'm dead.
well...
Hi, lazy.
how you feeling?
17, I hope.
well, we have that Thorne lady to thank for that.
I came here thinking I couldn't trust anyone.
boy, was I wrong.
I wish I could have done more.
you made sure that nobody would have to go through what my brother went through--that's enough.
and I still wanna work on a cure for you.
it worked for Zoe. That's what's important.
and I can leave here thinking about my future instead of my past.
that's quite a gift.
where will you go?
I'm quitea resourceful gal.
whoever I become next,
I'll be well taken care of.
good-bye, Henry.
thank you for giving me a new life.
are you sure that Mansfield doesn't know that we have the remains?
I convinced him that they were destroyed down in the bunker along with most of their research.
and I promised Eva that I would lay them to rest.
Hmph.
we are laying it all to rest.
Henry, I
I've been kind of afraid to ask you this, but was I...
exposed? No. Oh, no.
Oh, okay.
no, the resultscame back negative.
good. I just, um,
I guess I just need some rest.
Although...I did find something else.
So...party at Pilar's tonight?
you sure you're feeling up to it?
I'm feeling up to a lot of things.
good thought to hold onto.
I'm not gonna look.
I'm--I'm not gonna look, okay?
I shouldn't have looked.
you're a good dad.
well, I don't know.
glad things are back to normal.
you know, as normalas they get.
getting excited about being an uncle?
Yeah, I guess.
I-I'm--you know, never really had boys around.
well, they'll need a role model.
true. I can finally coach little league.
you would bea great coach.
I was kind a hoping, um...
you'd be mine.
okay. You gonna...
take up t-ball, or...
no, my, uh...
my birthing coach.
I'm pregnant.
how?
the usual way.
I got the...drill.
wow, so--so it's--Nathan's.
you okay?
Oh, general Mansfield.
you sure don't make my job easy, do you, Carter?
Where's Thorne?
general, I can explain.
Dr. Blake, I have no evidence that you've been insubordinate.
don't give me any.
uh, sir...
she's not so much a fugitiveas a victim, and
your job is to enforce the law, not to make judgments.
Yes, sir.
you're a good man, but you disobeyed a direct order, and this time, I can't look the other way.
Eureka no longer requires your services.
you are fired, Carter.
s. A.R. A.H. have you seen my phone?
great.
morning, Dr. Blake.
good morning. - Morning.
good morning, Dr. Blake.
is anyone else gonna come out of there? - It's a closet, not a clown car.
okay, what were you guys doing in there?
they were both servicing me. - I'm sorry that I asked.
well, with Holly's essence in S. A.R. A.H.'s computer,
I thought it might be nice to display her in a holographic form.
I mean, we're just working out the final details.
how do I look? - Exactly like you.
I asked for bigger boobs.
you were perfect before your untimely interruption, - and you are perfect now. - Aww. Air kiss...
I can't actually touch anything...
Yes, Holly, I'm familiar with the concept of holograms.
fargo, when was the last time that you slept or...bathed, or weren't here?
my love can neither sleep nor bathe nor leave.
so I shall do none of these until she can.
and don't worry, I have plenty of sick days accrued.
and I'm giving Dr. Fargo tips on dating a non-traditional entity.
Yes, because one of you dating my house wasn't non-traditional enough.
where is my phone? - Mom, I told Dre we'd give him a ride to school today, so we have to go.
okay, well, if I could find my phone or anything else around here.
dungeon master, where were we?
approaching a subterranean river in the caverns beneath the orc-infested keep. - You know ???
I can use that 50-foot pole I have stored in my portable hole.
has anyone seen my phone?
I... I think I found it.
where? - There it is.
it... shocked me.
mine did too. What's going on?
what? What?
happy Feynman Day.
great. Feynman Day.
and a fine day for a Feynman Day it is.
you have no clue. - No. Remind me.
global's version of April fool's day.
richard Feynman was a Nobel prize-winning physicist famous for his practical jokes.
so a bunch of science nerds playing pranks on each other.
what could go wrong? - Yes.
I have to go inspect the medical equipment for the new marine lab before it opens tomorrow.
a day alone in an empty underwater lab is exactly what I need today.
you mean a day alone with your fiance is what you need now. - Well...
it is not my fiance that I'm avoiding.
I think I'll avoid G. D. today myself.
Henry wants to talk about the bachelor party anyway.
yeah? Well, good luck.
on that note, any chance we could maybe, uh...
nail down a date for the wedding?
it's on my list of things to do.
great, 'cause I spoke to Zoe, and she's really excited.
and if you look on the calendar, I've actually marked off...
I saw the calendar, and I will, uh, let my family know about the wedding as soon as I...
can. - You haven't... You haven't...
told your family about the wedding?
please don't get that look.
I... look, I've just been really...
you know what, I don't want to get into it right now. Okay?
okay. - I gotta go.
okay.
hey Boss. If you're not busy, I'm gonna head out.
actually, I think I might have an assignment for you.
you know how Fargo's been living on my couch and spending every second with his sort of dead girlfriend?
it's not healthy.
I don't imagine it's very good for your pre-marital bliss either.
no, there is that.
so I'm wondering, in your loveable and tactful way, if you could maybe...
kick him to the curb? - Glad we understand each other. Thank you.
invisible barrier, pre-approved.
magnetized pants, pre-approved.
stop! Let me down!
guys? Guys!
foam party in the detergent lab not approved!
who is responsible for this? - I didn't do that.
I'm just here about my brachiopods. I can't find them.
dinosaurs. Okay, tell me you're kidding.
no, uh, not brachiosauri.
artemia salina, to be precise.
very tiny, very harmless. Just not where they should be.
missing who-zits... Not on my list.
people, what part of "pre-approved" do you not understand? - Relax, Jo.
try embracing spontaneity for once.
see, you say spontaneity, and I say reckless disregard for consequences.
I have 1, 000 reconstituted lungfish in the estivation lab.
the thermodynamics wing is now a sauna.
and the cafeteria floor is a trampoline.
you're Kinda missing the point of Feynman Day, aren't you?
you mean there's a point to all of this idiocy?
Yes. Some of the greatest innovations in history were the result of a really cool prank.
how do you think we discovered antimatter and velcro?
Seriously? - Well, no.
but it's possible, and you're kinda squelching that potential.
damn straight!
okay, the next one of you eggheads to pull an unapproved prank will be subjected to unapproved discipline. Spread the word.
what?
it looks like someone treated your clothes with nanofibers from the meta-materials lab.
bring on the unapproved discipline.
get outta here!
what the hell?
seriously, you drank the coffee I sent you? You're a dumb-ass.
just chill. I just messed with the speech center of your parietal lobe a little bit.
you'll un-beaker in a day or two.
well, three, tops.
congratulations, you've been promoted to head of section five...
dumb-ass.
this is your idea of payback.
nice try. You know what? You're right.
you know, you wouldn't have the stones, so why don't you tell Lupo to leave the pranks to professionals, okay?
nice touch, but I'm still not going anywhere near section five.
sweet silence.
computer, status?
initiating mobile lab detachment.
what? No, no, no. No detachment.
computer, override. - Override unauthorized.
prepare for airlock seal.
what? No. Remain docked. Remain docked!
help! Help!
is anyone out there?
is anyone up there?
damn it.
mobile lab launch successful. - Yeah, depends on your point of view.
surprise!
you pulled a prank on me?
well, I wouldn't so much call it a prank as a surprise! - I hate surprises.
how do you not know that about me? - Well, I didn't think it was a bad surprise.
my God, one moment alone. Is that so much to ask for?
come on down. Just...
think you're gonna like this one.
there you go.
Oh My God.
come... sit.
I'm virtual Vincent, and I'll be your tour guide through each delectable course of my feast d'amour as well as through your undersea cruise through the enchanting Global Dynamics aquafarm.
enjoy.
so...
this took a lot of preparation,
Yeah.
well, that wine isn't gonna pour itself.
no. Thank you.
little Help, please! Anybody?
check this out.
no, no! Not approved!
Larry, stop!
you almost unleashed a flood.
where is your P. A? I am ending this right now.
listen up, Global. Feynman Day is over.
anyone perpetrating a prank, authorized or not, will be spending the night in lockup.
as grand Poo-Bah of section five, I demand to be amused.
let the section five pranks continue. - Mr. Donovan...
and by the way, - you're looking smokin', Lupo. - What?
Really?
Holly rolls a 20! - Head shot...
that eliminates the last of the orc combatants.
do you wish to proceed deeper into the keep?
guys, here's a thought. You know how college roommates have a sign to let the other one know they're getting busy inside?
a," my college experience did not involve a lot of "getting busy.
and, "B," does the compound word non sequitur mean anything to you?
I'm going somewhere with this.
seeing as how we're both romantically involved with this house, to one degree or another, perhaps we should have a similar system. Like today, for example.
we could pretend that I put out the sign, and you have to go.
I'm not going anywhere.
but to be fair, you have been monopolizing all of her time, and...
you and S. A.R. A.H. have an eternity to spend together. Holly and I might only have...
wait, might only...
s. A.R. A.H? S. A.R. A.H. where did she go? Is she okay?
I am unable to answer those questions with any degree of certainty.
as you know, Dr. Fargo, maintaining Holly's existence...
just get her back as soon as you can... get her back!
have what?
only have until the end of this campaign until I have to go back to work.
s. A.R. A.H. we're going deeper.
nice...
if Zane wants discipline, I will give him discipline.
not approved!
this salad is really delicious.
every ingredient in your kelp salad was organically grown right here in Eureka's own aquafarm, the largest manmade saltwater ocean habitat in the world.
Alli... how could you not tell your family?
Jack, please, can we just enjoy this meal?
here's an interesting tidbit.
lake Archimedes is home to over 10, 000 forms of aquatic life.
when I'm excited about something in my life...
for instance, my wedding day...
I like to share it with my loved ones.
and I'm going to tell them. - Okay, when?
cause it feels like you're stalling.
this from the guy who took four years to ask me out?
I mean, what is the big rush? - Let's just take a breath.
a breath for what? - And remember, there's no need for you lovebirds to be shy around virtual Vincent.
what happens in the mobile obser...
lights.
maybe we should just do this another time.
maybe we should.
what do you mean?
well, what to you mean?
I meant lunch. - Right, that's what I meant too. Lunch.
all right.
Henry told me how to take it out of autopilot.
I've just gotta remember the sequence.
Jack. - Hold on, I...
I did it with a song. It was...
what... yeah...
that doesn't look like it's on the programmed tour.
okay, number sequence. Right, it's... it's, uh...
seven. The... the...
four... uh... the... - Go on!
Yes! Watch it!
gotta say I was expecting something a little worse.
auxiliary power activated. - Okay, well, whatever it was, it fried the power.
propulsion, navigation, communication... they're all down.
all right. Now what?
we drift down to the bottom of the lake, and we brace for touchdown.
brace, brace, brace.
again, not so bad.
that's bad!
don't move. - Okay.
what the hell are those?
automatic safety shields. - Okay.
Jack, we are not on stable ground.
if we go over the edge, this lab was not built to take that kind of fall.
okay, can, uh... Can we drop anchor?
secure to the lake bed?
it's okay. - We don't have an anchor.
all right, can we, uh...
maybe fire torpedoes?
Jack, this is a marine lab, not the Red October.
how 'bout fire a...
like a... like... Like a grappling hook thing...
Seriously? - Well, at least I'm trying!
wait a minute, the lab does have a couple sample probes.
if I could bypass the electronic trigger,
I could... I could manually launch all the probes towards the trench at once, and maybe the reaction will push us backwards onto stable ground.
Yeah, that's different from firing torpedoes.
and now an explosion in the alkali metals lab?
seriously, if undermining my authority wasn't enough, someone could have really been hurt.
Jo, come on. I didn't blow this place up.
are you going to deny these assorted acts of "spontaneity" too?
all right, well, that one was me, but you've gotta admit it was kind of funny.
okay, Zane... - Okay, wait, wait, wait.
there is a common denominator to a bunch of these, but it's not me, it's water. They're all water-based. Look at this.
steam in thermodynamics, reconstituted lungfish.
Fishbowling Fargo's office, the avalanche of lather.
Yeah, and alkali metals, which don't exactly play well together.
watch.
the reaction's so violent that it ignites the liberated hydrogen gas.
all right.
Rubidium... water...
you might want to stand back a little bit.
okay.
you ready?
multiply that by a couple thousand grams... - And you get fireworks.
Yeah. Not exactly the spirit of Feynman Day.
maybe this wasn't a prank. - What do you mean?
do you hear that? - What?
I think it's... Behind here.
a broken down sprinkler? - No.
the lab uses a halon fire suppression system.
so where's the water coming from?
Henry, I was just headed your way.
okay, so G. D.'s water systems are in the clear.
no leaky pipes, no overflows. Nada.
Where's this water coming from? - Lake Archimedes.
okay. Wasn't expecting that.
Yeah, you and me both. I analyzed the water from the pranks, and the high content of artemia salina was the same in each.
it's from our lake, no question. - Who... back it up. Arti who?
artemia salina. Tiny brachiopods?
whatever it is you're doing, does it have to be done on the tippy side of the boat?
do you really think I arbitrarily just picked a spot to bypass the electrical system?
if my weight hasn't put us over the brink.
I don't think a few more minutes is likely to make a difference.
likely" is the word I'd like to focus on.
well, I am going to focus on my plan to move us back from the edge of oblivion.
your plan... Which is based on my plan.
Yes, Jack, you are the genius.
wait, that's it, isn't it?
that's what? - Why you haven't told your family.
I don't measure up against the geniuses you brought home.
come on, you have to know, after all these years, the differences in our I. Q. don't mean anything to me.
Aha! So you admit there's a difference!
of course there's a difference.
what are the odds that we would be exactly the same?
well, I don't know. I'm not bright enough to figure it out!
you know what, Jack, this is your issue, not mine.
what do you think, I go around comparing your I. Q. with my previous husbands'?
I do now.
you know what? Me and my genius I. Q. are gonna go back to saving our lives.
at least we survived the descent. - Yeah.
so we're good?
Yeah, we're great.
that's not what I...
never mind.
you know, when we don't get back on time, Jo will know what to do.
she's built for this sort of rescue.
great. Maybe she'll wear her sexy cat suit for the occasion.
I saw you two in the corner at G. D. this morning whispering together.
we were whispering about this.
she's the one who helped me pull it off.
well, look how great it's turned out.
you're... You're still hung up on her?
that was a fake relationship between a fake her and a fake me in a fake computer world!
a fake computer world designed to follow a plausible course of events!
if you think that I spend my day comparing computer-world Jo to you, that's your issue, not mine.
Jack, what are we doing?
is that a trick question? Because I'm not very bright, so...
we never used to be like this.
I mean, our life is becoming nuts. - I hadn't noticed.
I guess it's always nuts.
but we have always been able to get through anything together.
Jack, I'm not worried about Jo, or even the differences between us.
I'm worried about losing what we have.
and you really think that's gonna happen? - I think that it's already happening.
we've gotten so caught up in the romance of things, we haven't stopped to think about reality.
the merging of our households, our family.
the chaos of it all.
Jack, our kids will become our kids.
what if things don't work out?
I never thought about it not working out. Yeah, well, there's a lot at stake here.
I mean, it's... It's something that we have to consider.
what you and I have built together is sacred to me.
and if we do this...
and it doesn't work out...
we will never be able to go back to the way things were.
before.
at this moment, you'll get a remarkable view of the famous Archimedes trench.
but you wouldn't want to take the plunge into that abyss.
that thing... Is crazy deep!
Fowler, I found your missing brachiopods.
Yeah, along with a cubic ton of lake water that you neglected to mention.
well, the water's not important.
well, Dr. Fargo might feel differently when he's swimming to his desk.
do you know how many labs, how many projects you've destroyed today?
I was trying to fine-tune my targeting system before the marine lab opens tomorrow.
look, it seems that particle entanglement is more, or perhaps less entangled than I originally anticipated.
and Dr. Fargo's recent redaction of my recent redaction is contingent upon proof that my matter relocator has practical applications, hence the brachiopods.
okay, less "why," more "how.
okay, I have been attempting to transfer a sample of artemia salina from lake Archimedes all day.
now, my readouts show that it's been both taken and deposited, but...
but you flooded G. D. instead.
you know, I bet someone's Feynman Day antics are responsible for scrambling my directional signal, not to mention my job security.
okay, listen, I'm gonna deal with the pranksters, but in the meantime, I want this machine kept off.
someone left the faucet on?
no, someone left Feynman Day on.
would you please go and shut down any section five pranks still in play?
look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but those guys aren't gonna listen to me.
whether you believe it or not, you're head of section five.
so just stop acting like a 12-year-old and man up.
okay.
but if this is a prank... - Zane...
I'm not interested in stooping to your level.
my level. Real... ly?
does that look like a chunk of the new submersible to you?
to me it looks like a key section of the digital integrated circuitry that powers every operating system on board.
worse than chunk. - Yeah, a little bit.
the mobile lab's not too mobile anymore.
how'd that get here?
Fowler relocated it.
Henry, please answer.
and the paladin rolls another 20!
it's not very fair, your being able to control your roll so precisely and all.
Yeah, but he's on our team, so sha-bam!
head shot!
hold on.
I'm taking a sick day, Jo. This better be important.
fargo, we have an emergency search and rescue. We need you at G. D.
when you say emergency, is that with a little "E"?
Doug, go. - Yeah, but we're...
it's not like I won't be here when you get back.
don't worry, Dr. Fargo, I'll watch after your girl for you.
I'll call you if anything happens.
okay.
my turn?
tell me you found them. - Yeah, we're working on it.
Jack and Allison did not take the programmed route.
well, what about communications? - No go. We've got rescue divers combing the water.
they're doing high and low-resolution sonar sweeps of the lake.
sweeps complete.
no hits. How's that possible? - Okay, they're down there somewhere... we missed them.
impossible, unless... - The Archimedes trench.
it's more than a mile deep, and that lab will not survive the pressure for very long.
how do we get to them? We can borrow a submersible from the nearest naval base, but that'll take hours to prep and transport.
how much oxygen do they have? - Nine hours, maybe more.
if that capsule's still intact, we'll get 'em back.
I trust you're both enjoying the "lobster du love."
this succulent invertebrate is one of lake Archimedes' most voracious bottom feeders - and is a denizen of the aquafarms you're now passing on the right. - Really?
one thing works down here, and it's gotta be him.
every seafood lover has had a bite of one of these succulent creatures.
any seafood lover wouldn't have it any other way.
you... - Enjoy... And I'll be back...
can you please stop banging?
it's clearly not working.
clearly.
okay, listen.
I'm sure everyone's working hard to find us, so while we wait, can we please not fight?
or bang things.
okay.
who's in the mood for something sweet?
the pressure! - Go! Go!
go!
my God.
come on!
what's the point of an airlock if it's not airtight? Can we seal this?
Jack, I don't think we can stop this lab from filling with water.
don't mean to be a buttinski, but might I suggest a dessert wine?
sure! What goes good with a watery grave?
I'd have to check the Cafe Diem database and get back to you in a jiff.
Jack, wait!...
if he can connect to an outside database, then he has or had a super wi-fi connection.
I realized it just as it left my hand.
okay, we might have lucked out.
if I can get this thing working again...
okay...
Mayday! MayDay!
Vincent, what are you... - Hello? Anyone there?
can you hear me? Okay, we need help.
we just got vortexted... Or something.
my God, it's Jack! They're using virtual Vincent's super wi-fi connection to communicate.
we need to open up a two-way signal and lose the visual.
then we fell into a trench, and now we're in the airlock, which, by the way, is not as safe as it sounds!
all right, Jack, it's Henry. - Henry!
we have a submersible on the way. It'll take a few hours, but even in the airlock, you shouldn't be in any danger of losing oxygen.
we're gonna drown before we run out of oxygen.
Henry, we're gonna be underwater in less than ten minutes.
there's gotta be another way to get down there.
Fowler. Turn that thing back on.
what? - Now!
okay, he can relocate them. He brought up a piece of the lab earlier.
it doesn't work. - Zane, you shut down all the pranks, right?
Yeah. Although none of them utilize an energy spectrum that would have messed with Fowler's system.
that's because it wasn't a prank. What?
I did some tinkering since we last spoke, and it turns out my targeting system is faulty.
even if we had their precise location, I couldn't pinpoint them.
well, Zane, you've been targeting me all day. How?
I programmed this baby to lock onto your DNA, making you the bulls-eye for an infrasonic meta-material changing frequency.
that's... That's kinda brilliant. - Yeah, I can pleather her at will.
no, for saving Carter and Allison. We have their DNA on file.
if we can program Zane's DNA target system into Fowler's matter relocator, then maybe we've got a shot.
Jack, it's a long shot, but we're gonna use Fowler's device to relocate you and Allison back to G. D.
I know it sounds risky, but it's all we've got.
Allison, we're trusting our lives to this thingy that relocated a slab of beef into Oblivion?
what if it mixes our DNA with, like, fish, and then we end up like mer-people? I mean, do they even think about stuff like that?
Jack! We have to stop worrying about what might happen and start focusing on what we can do right now.
all right, good idea.
Yeah.
so what do you want to do? - Okay...
okay, okay... - Okay...
okay, listen. The pressure is crushing the lab like a tin can.
right. - Okay...
if we can manually disengage while there's still enough air in here...
right, oh! Then we can float.
well, we can hope for neutral buoyancy at best, but we should be able to get enough separation to stop the lab's collapse from sucking us in.
okay. Okay. How do we do it?
okay, there are four emergency release levers under us.
you have to pull them all to disengage. - Okay, I got it.
I'm on it. Okay?
I got it.
okay... It won't budge.
I think it got damaged during the fall. - Okay, then...
did you get it? - DNA on demand.
where do you want it? - Right here.
God!
the matter relocator will be operative in a few minutes, so just sit tight.
all right. So we wait.
okay. - Okay.
there's just one more thing. - What?
I've settled on a date. - What?
marry me, Jack. Right now.
are you sure?
I mean, I pictured something a little different.
and, of course, once we do this, we can't go back.
I don't want to go back.
okay. Henry, uh...
you ready for some on-the-fly officiating?
I don't know. I was kind of looking forward to being best man. - Yeah, great. You can be both.
well, Allison's gonna need a maid of honor. - I'm talking to her now.
all right, then. Dearly beloved...
we are gathered here today...
Henry, how about the cliffsnotes version?
right. Do you, Jack Carter, take Allison Blake to be your lawfully wedded wife, for richer or for poorer, for as long as you both shall live?
I do. - And do you, Allison Blake, take Jack Carter to be your lawfully wedded husband so long as you both shall live?
I do. Then, if there are no objections...
hold on.
what? - Just... I mean, you're not...
we're not just doing this because... I mean, we're...
we're really doing this, right? - I love you, Jack.
good answer.
bring us home, Henry!
then I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.
Jack, Allison, can you hear me? Jack?
Jack, Allison, can you hear me? - I have a lock on their DNA signatures.
hit it. Hit it! - Okay.
may I present doctor and mister Jack Carter!
Jack, we're married. - How's it feel?
wet.
okay. Here you go. - Thank you.
thank you.
by the way, you owe me a buck. - What?
you bet against the wedding?
l-I didn't think you'd actually go through with it.
well, you proved me wrong, so congrats, Carter. - Well, thank you.
we're still going through with that bachelor party, though, right? - Well, I think it-it...
it's something we can discuss.
you guys, that was so exciting.
Fowler, you're fired.
I kinda figured.
so thanks for helping Jack with my surprise today...
and for being my maid of honor.
well, I... I was the only girl here, so...
no. You really are my maid of honor.
you can cry now. - Thank you.
chicks. Whatcha gonna do?
okay.
don't waste a second with her. Not one.
congratulations, Carter.
Thanks, Fargo.
Jack, go be with your wife. - Right.
so what's the deal with me running section five? - It was my idea. You like?
I... I... yeah. But why?
because you deserve it.
no, no, I-I don't.
everyone knows I'm a maturity-challenged screw-up with little to no capacity for leadership.
that's what everyone knew about me too.
it took a time-line shift to throw me into the deep end, but I swam. So will you.
I'm thinking something small. Your family and my family...
Yeah, I don't know. - You want to talk about it?
I'm...
it's about Holly.
you're here bright and early.
gotta make a good impression on my subordinates.
look, Zane, I may have been a little too uptight about Feynman Day.
I was wrong.
that's okay.
I would apologize for your wardrobe malfunction, except your butt just looked so damn good in that outfit.
but I get it. It's your job to make sure everyone's safe.
and you take it seriously. I can respect that.
I lobbed you a softball, and you took the high road.
fargo picked the right man for the job.
Yeah. Well, I hope you're right.
because I just gave myself an assignment that I can't screw up.
fargo gave me his trust, and I'm gonna give him something back.
what's that?
she's dying again.
we were hoping S. A.R. A.H.'s processors could handle her, but... - Is there a computer that can?
no. Whatever Holly is now, she's more than just information as we know it.
sustaining her is gonna take a breakthrough in computer programming that... - That only you can do.
exactly.
identity confirmed. Welcome, Mr. Donovan.
I'm sure your butt looks pretty good too.
morning, boss. Mrs. Boss.
don't worry, I'm not staying... I just thought you might want somebody to drop off the kids today.
Andy, that's very thoughtful of you.
and I'm gonna take Jenna to the new animation exhibit after school.
you know, to give you guys a few more hours of alone time. - Thanks.
Yeah, I'm gonna get out of your hair too.
you guys have been more than patient, and I can't keep ignoring my responsibilities.
I am thinking of keeping the beard, though.
I'm not sure that's a good idea, necessarily.
and I can't technically leave, heh, but I can go into sleep mode to give you privacy as long as you want. You just...
okay... stop.
nobody's going anywhere.
fargo, in light of Holly,
I think maybe your responsibilities can wait.
and, Andy... Why don't you take a sick day?
you're playing hooky today.
so you guys really want to deal with total chaos on your first full day as husband and wife?
you bet we do.
our life is total chaos, and we wouldn't want it any other way.
so... come on.
what's this game we're playing? - A fantasy role-playing game.
we can always add a few more party members to the quest.
all right. Can I be sheriff?
might he be under a fighter class?
I would say paladin, because he's a good fighter, right? That's it.
no?
come on, it's fun.
add some yogurt to it. - No!
hello.
you woke up...
no playing Game Boy! - Yes!
come on, we're making ice cream! - No!
everything alright? - Yes.
what?
it suits you very well.
maybe your uncle will call you more often now.
what's so awful about me?
listen, if you can't stand someone, me for example, it's not all that bad.
it's only bad if you don't tell me. Because then I don't even know if...
if it's something I can change or not.
answer me, I want to know why you think I'm so awful.
you know what? - What?
just say, "I hate you. "
I hate you.
Louder! You can do it much louder, "I hate you!"
"I hate you!" - And now, - "I detest you." - "I detest you！"
and now quietly and really mean, "Never call me again " .
never call me again.
right, and now shoot me dead.
everyone ELSE
I forgot to strip your bed, those sheets are ours.
come on, I'll take them with me.
who knows when I'll see you again? Rebecca will flip out.
sorry.
Bye. - Bye.
we have to discuss our sex life.
I can't manage it anymore.
so I've called for reinforcements.
Hi, who are you?
you sure are small! - "So that's Gitti..."
" she's as hot as you said, Chris, really. "
stop groping me!
what?
Hey, he's...
he's saying something. Can you hear him, too?
Schnappi wants to know what a penis actually is.
because he'd like to be one, but needs a bit more information.
I told him that he's much too small in the first place, and that he shouldn't be so dirty.
do you hear him, too, or is it just me?
I hear him, too.
but he said something else to me. - What?
that you should shut up when I'm reading.
no, he didn't say that. - Yes, he did.
don't move.
Hello!
Yoo-hoo!
what are you doing?
who was that? - "Wine-Heinz," our neighbor.
man, for a second I thought...
Hans had found out where we are and I look like a transvestite...
it's not a vacation if I have to see him. - Who?
Hans. - We don't have to see anyone.
that would've been so "him." Hans is such a "coincidental guy " .
he coincidentally comes by when something coincidentally happens, and he coincidentally meets someone who introduces him...
like with "documenta," when he was called by accident.
did you see his work there?
Yeah, it was really good.
it's very "in" without being stupid.
rebellious architecture.
pity.
that's how you like me, as a girl.
yes...
it somehow suits you.
do you think I'm masculine?
Yeah. - Right.
no, I'm laughing at the question.
I always thought it'd come naturally, with age.
but nothing's happening.
except for my hair falling out. - Your hair's falling out?
no, I think you're completely beautiful.
and sexy.
you don't have to be masculine!
what do you mean by that?
then do something masculine and see if I notice.
God, I can't think of anything.
I just have to win the competition. - Exactly.
you just feel a bit unsuccessful.
man, I never wanted to be unsuccessful.
you're not unsuccessful.
did I tell you that I called them? - No.
the guy knew our proposal right away.
I promise it'll work out. I know it.
why are you laughing? - Because you're such a terrible actor.
what?
with your arm.
you've never done that before.
but I wasn't acting!
and did they announce the runners-up?
same old story...
it wasn't too complicated.
Philip, that isn't true.
it wasn't too complicated.
Hey, don't be sad.
Yes, see you, bye.
And?
hasn't been decided yet. They need more time.
pity.
but maybe that's a good sign, right?
it's no sign at all. - How's Philip?
good.
my TV time's over, right?
you don't even understand anything. You're just staring!
are you crazy, forbidding me to watch TV?
are you sad? Hey.
no, just tired.
you looked sad.
can I ask you something? - No.
do you hate me sometimes?
what kind of question is that?
for example, in the living room just now.
there was something in your eyes.
that was hate.
I hate you sometimes... - I didn't ask you.
but I hate when you... - I didn't ask you!
please lie on top of me.
with all of your weight.
so, are we going to a disco? Please?
no. - Please, please.
it's Friday, please, let's go dancing. I'll take you to a disco.
please! - No, everything's closed.
everything's open.
please, come dancing. - No.
please, please, please... - No, I don't want to...
please, Chris, please.
are you nuts?
what?
what does that mean?
I said you look great.
you don't want to go.
can you please speak German?
your mother is really quirky. - Look, disco!
lots of action here...
it's usually packed.
maybe we're too early.
and how is the music?
great, let's go straight to the dance floor.
come on, show me what you've got!
be the dancing bear!
come on.
this sucks. - Do it.
you're so stupid!
can't we do it without one? It's much nicer.
it's much nicer without one.
I love you.
I love you.
no, don't always answer like that.
you make me so happy, Gitti.
I'm so lucky to have met you.
you were the most beautiful woman in the whole disco.
I love you.
what's there to reconstruct here? It's already perfect.
I don't think I'll reconstruct anything. This is a renovation, not a reconstruction.
I'd do it. It'd be fun, something different.
you can't really mean that.
so...
the owner wants a lounge area here with a curving bar.
all with a Japanese touch.
no more country style.
and I'll rent an SUV, drive up to the site and yell at the Italians.
and if you really earn so much money, I'll come and help you.
get serious. You don't want me to pick out curtains for this place.
no, I just thought you could really make it great.
why not try something new? - Because it has nothing to do with me.
I would do it.
let's take a nap. - I don't think I can get a hard-on here.
my father thinks I could make some contacts.
if you win the competition, you won't have the time to do it anyway.
or could you do both?
let's go hiking before it gets too late.
they should just knock down the whole thing.
my God.
shit, you're bleeding all over.
shit, I bled all over. Grab something to wipe it up.
who closed the door?
we're going to the hospital. - I want to go hiking.
you're crazy, we're going to the hospital!
right.
have a nice flight.
Yes, have fun. Bye.
still feeling sick? - Yes, a bit.
who was that anyway? - The guitarist from The Shames.
the Shames...
why do you let them depend on you? Anyone can book a flight.
well, I guess they like me.
what a Schnappisaster.
a Schnappilemma.
a...
Schnapptastrophy.
one Schnappucino, please. - Schnappussy!
are you schnapped up?
you're the Schnappussy.
you're still lying there! - Where have you been the whole time?
we're invited on a motorboat trip.
by whom?
two Germans. I met them in a café.
but why?
because they have a boat and I said we'd like to go for a ride.
and who are they? What do they do?
I don't know what they do, something normal. They're really nice.
nice?
'Authentic people" like Ingrid and Rainer from the ferry, whose mobile home you found so very fascinating?
don't be so arrogant!
pretending to be like them is arrogant, too.
look, I brought you a piece of pie.
and then,
I bought something for myself.
which I don't really like.
stand up straight!
I don't like it, I feel so bourgeois.
looks good, you can wear that.
what happened to Schnappi?
we banged heads.
what did you do the whole time?
lie there?
in that tragic pose...
I was thinking.
about what?
about everything.
about myself.
about yourself?
what's there to think about... - Can't we talk normally?
Yes, sorry.
what were you thinking about?
I don't know what to do.
everything seems so silly to me.
us? - I'm not talking about us, now listen!
you're not listening! - Yes, I am.
what's so silly?
what we all do.
how I live.
my work.
were you thinking about the villa?
I think you have to take a risk. You're too afraid.
you're so afraid of committing to something.
maybe that's idealistic, but it's not very brave, either.
I don't mean just your work. I mean everything, you don't even notice it!
you can't take 14 days for one decision.
or endlessly consider inviting two people to dinner.
that's total standstill!
you're so desperately intent on not letting anything restrict you or distract you from your ideals.
sure, theoretically you're free to go anywhere you want, but then you really have to do it.
it's always, "I should do this or that, no, this, no, that..."
then you don't do any of it!
because you're attached to your studio, bikes and books like people are to their children.
then you show off your independence, forcing Philip to tell you how much he misses his freedom because of his family.
but what you don't see, and he probably doesn't admit, is how nice it is to come home to where his children are sleeping.
he's free to leave the apartment again.
but maybe he'd rather just lie in bed with his girlfriend.
why not take a risk?
if it doesn't work out, so what?
I'd like to live with you.
we could try it out.
you can have your room with some hay and a light bulb so you feel at home.
sorry that I talked so much, but I've wanted to tell you that for a long time.
why do you think you know me so well?
I wanted to talk about something completely different.
set the table.
will I never find out what you wanted to tell me?
sometimes I want so badly to be different for you.
Why? How do you want to be?
sometimes it could be a woman in the street or in a restaurant.
then I picture you two being a couple and it seems to fit better.
the women are mostly very different from me.
then I can't stop thinking I should be different for you.
or at least I'd wish to be, because I think.
I'd make you much happier if I were different.
and sometimes I think I should show you more often that I admire you.
how much I love you.
because I love everything about you.
you don't have to. - But I do.
and then I think that if I were different, I could get to know you in another way.
that's my saddest thought, that I can't get to know you in that way.
sometimes I'd really like to be different.
that's pretty immature, I guess.
no, I've had such thoughts, too.
I always think I'm too boring for you.
when I first met you, I always pictured myself entering a room where you are, and you'd say something to me, and I'd just jump out of a window to surprise you.
but that's sad.
Yes, no, I wouldn't die,
I'd just casually fly out like Batman.
that's not very consistent.
you should die for me.
what's that? We don't need that. - Schnappi needs it.
Schnappi eats what Schnappi gets!
there.
sorry, can I pass?
sana, wait, they have light beer here.
are you out of your mind?
come here!
what is it? - It's Hans.
what should we do?
Oh, God, Hans! What should we do?
over there!
Hi.
quietly!
Wondrascheck!
I got you!
I can't believe it,Hans!
what a coincidence!
look, Gitti, I coincidentally ran into Hans. - No, how funny!
what a coincidence! Hello, I'm Gitti.
has your vacation turned that bad already? - Yes, right.
sana, come here!
look who I caught up with. - What a coincidence!
nice to see you! - My wife.
nonsense!
what happened to you?
it's not that bad. I hit myself with something.
the glass door wouldn't see it like that.
at last we meet! I always bore Hans so quickly.
we definitely would've called you. - I doubt that.
definitely. We didn't know you were already here.
I don't believe a word.
but you can't escape me. I instinctively strolled around the corner.
we've never met, right? - No, we haven't.
sorry, I meet so many people. Good that you know for sure.
now to my offer.
we bought some great lamb, you'll come right over and we'll barbecue.
Oh, yes.
actually, we're going on a boat trip.
maybe we can miss that.
we could bring them, too. - We don't know those people.
come over!
it's pretty impolite of us not to show up, isn't it?
are you still talking? - Yes.
I didn't know you knew him so well. The way you hugged...
he's always like that.
I thought they'd be even worse.
why are you taking that off? It hasn't even healed.
are you taking it off because of them?
let's secretly turn around and go on the boat trip!
relax.
no, no! - I'm not sick!
here. - You want me to get really fat, right?
right.
I have to tell them.
sana is pregnant.
Congratulations! - Yes, congratulations.
can't even see it. - Yes, you can!
I hope I don't become too fat. - We've been playing "parents," too.
Chris' sister was here with her children, but we weren't very successful.
Really? - Yes.
it belongs to a painter friend of ours, Ulrich Wulff, - the guy with the noses. - I don't know him.
take a seat.
and over there, she picked the apple naked.
you can open that. - Okay.
your parents chose a very special island.
you'll have to give us some tips. - Yes, sure. No problem.
is Hans reading that?
no, Hans wouldn't. I'm reading it.
this is from a nearby farm, really delicious.
delicious. - Come on...
have you been to Sardinia often? - No, it's my first time.
it's a great island.
I always say, "Great, great, great."
"great island. Great in Sardinia..."
we opened the champagne for you? - Yes, I thought we'd have a toast.
you're the first ones we've told.
Really? Great!
then here's to you. - Yes, good luck.
my girlfriend has a dress by you. She guards it with her life.
I also think your stuff is great.
I just can't afford it.
I can't either.
sana is so successful, I had to impregnate her to balance things out.
finally the truth comes out!
you think that suits me, being a father?
sure, it suits everyone. - I don't know...
well, we don't know each other that well.
we don't? We know each other pretty well.
sure we do, but we're not really...
a friend of yours could judge that better.
Gitti, he talks about me a lot, doesn't he? - Yes, every single night!
just what I imagined. - Just what I thought...
you're my only friend.
maybe you could become friends.
exactly.
am I just pregnant or do you two have crazy dreams here, too?
I don't dream much. - I had such a funny dream.
last night, I dreamt that Larissa, the artist, and I had adopted a giraffe.
we were sitting on a little hill, drinking coffee, waiting for the giraffe.
and when they brought the giraffe to us,
I realized the hill was exactly as high as the giraffe.
we were so stressed out and I was so afraid!
suddenly, Hans showed up.
and he touched the giraffe confidently, like a pro, as if he'd never done anything else in his life!
that was so comforting. Hans greeted the giraffe so calmly.
he was the only one who could really handle the giraffe.
what could that mean?
I don't think it's very subtle.
that's what's so embarrassing!
it's not embarrassing not to have profound dreams.
you're right.
Chris, tell us what you're doing.
don't be so secretive.
all kinds of things.
I might do something here on the island, reconstruct a villa.
And? Something good?
it could be. We'll see.
and what are you up to?
I've been working too much.
I need to collect my thoughts.
we worked for the "documenta" for 18 months.
built a new orangery.
I'm a bit clueless right now.
I'm here to recover and lose weight so I don't look so bad when the baby arrives.
but was it fun? - Of course, it was great.
that guy should do something like that. - What guy?
your boyfriend.
he's really good, but he's a romantic. - Why's he a romantic?
because he believes in a world that doesn't exist.
that's a bit too mystical for me. I don't know what you mean.
if you win a cool competition and don't see it through just because your design is combined with another, it's not idealistic, it's stupid.
it bothers me, too, but I have some red wine and cheese with the people, act like my ideas are theirs, and in the end I have my way.
why are you talking to me when he's sitting here?
because I'm talking to you.
Chris knows what I think and that I'd always help him.
with old-fashioned clichés and lectures? He doesn't need them.
he didn't mean it like that. - Of course he did. You're annoyed, too.
come on. - "Come on!"
I find you a bit too patronizing. - Well, that's how I am.
I don't care how you are! - Stop it now!
that's enough! - Hello, this is silly.
we all think, especially Hans, that Chris does great work.
I'll get you all a grappa to calm things down.
I've never called anyone but Chris a genius.
it's true. I don't know anyone who can design such complex things - in a simple, intelligent way. - You're doing it again.
what?
you judge everything so generously!
I don't need to talk to you about this.
you really are a Brunhilde. - Yes.
constantly defending her man.
I'm not a Brunhilde, I just don't want to listen to everything.
we don't have it easy, do we？
you're so embarrassing.
Voilà.
you're not angry, are you? - Nonsense!
I just want to see you do something.
what are you up to? Still working with Philip?
Yes, that's really good.
we complement each other perfectly.
but he's getting nervous. He thinks our designs are too expensive and complicated.
he has two children...
I recently saw your cool row-house design.
Yes, unfortunately it wasn't built either.
do you know the Lowa Competition people?
Yes, they all used to work at Hausmann.
totally conservative assholes.
we submitted something in a rush, but it didn't work out.
yeah...
we submitted something, too, but unfortunately it didn't work out either.
our design was really good.
they just give each other awards.
you didn't tell me that.
no.
I don't even want to know who's going to do that cool museum.
you failure.
Thanks.
what is that? - What?
this? My new backpack.
you're not taking that. - Yes, I am.
what's inside? - I can't say.
No! - I'm not walking with that.
you don't have to.
I won't carry it.
Oh, Chris.
it's a surprise.
tell me what's in it.
it's a paraglider.
you don't know everything about me. I used to do it a lot.
I want to fly into the valley with you.
really, I want to do it with you.
really!
sorry.
sorry, but you totally believed me!
not at all.
Yes, you did.
sorry.
sorry, I'm really sorry.
stay on the path. - Why?
they converge up ahead.
is it still far? - What?
the spot you're looking for.
are we even on the right mountain? - Yes, I know that.
great...
don't look!
champagne?
I think I know where it is now, up there a bit.
we can go there if you're sure.
I'm sure, but let's just stay here.
look at all that stuff.
I'm not getting drunk here.
I'll make you a plate.
why didn't you tell me about the competition?
I don't know, there wasn't the opportunity.
the whole week?
sorry it didn't work out.
I understand that people don't want to say things sometimes.
I just wanted to say that you're doing everything right, and it's great how you think about things...
Yes, and I don't care if you're successful or anything.
you know that, don't you?
let's move on.
it's great that we can still get lost.
we're not lost.
why don't you trust me? - Because we're lost!
I can't walk another five hours.
do you have to run like a maniac?
you're such an asshole!
haven't you noticed that I can't walk anymore?
do you need to be faster than I am?
there you are.
Thanks.
I'm driving to the city to have a drink with Hans.
but I can't stay here alone.
why can't you stay here alone?
because I'm afraid. - Right.
why don't you take me with you?
I want to come with you.
but I don't want you to come with me. - Why not?
because you can't behave normally.
what does that mean?
I don't want to relive a situation like the other night.
then just tell me what you want and how you want me to be.
just watch how other people act. - But I don't want to act like everyone else.
do you want a Sana?
Oh, the giraffe only trusted Hans.
all you do is exaggerate.
I'm much more normal.
let me go. - No, I'm much more normal!
Oh, I'm so normal, unbelievably normal!
Yes, I'm much more normal!
are you insane?
think someone's going to strangle you?
why are you awake so early?
I woke up.
was it that bad?
I didn't sleep very well.
why are you so wet?
drunken Hans threw me into the pool. - Into which pool?
I spontaneously showed Hans the villa.
Thanks.
what did Hans think of the villa?
interesting.
possibly...
are you going to do it now?
Yes, maybe. I'm going to meet the owner first.
I made it clear to him that I won't make any compromises.
good.
I'm going to bed, I'm tired.
do you still like me?
but you do still love me?
I'm going to the villa tomorrow morning to measure something.
okay.
I can do something else.
what a coincidence!
I was just thinking.
I know him from somewhere...
what are you doing here?
I wanted to exchange the dress.
then I suddenly liked it.
then I took a walk.
take a seat.
sure.
I didn't know you were meeting in the city. - We weren't, I was just hungry.
did you buy something? - Yes.
for your mother.
Why?
to thank her for the house. You'll think it's ugly.
show it to me.
it's cute, she'll definitely like it.
the meeting was really nice. - Yeah?
you might have a very rich boyfriend soon.
he was really excited about my work.
and he's interested in architecture, or at least he acts like he is.
I considered trying to get him to build something new.
Really?
I'm really happy for you.
no, thanks.
is it good?
I want to meet Hans and Sana again.
I can meet them alone or we can invite them over.
no, let's invite them over.
think you can handle that?
Yes.
I think it's a good idea, too.
I told them Saturday.
I can cook something.
Hello, Gitti?
I wasn't sure it was you.
my boyfriend...
Hi, I'm Sandra. - Hi.
Hello, we're the Petersens.
Yes, I'm sorry. We didn't show up.
Yes, we noticed that. - I'm sorry.
I forgot we had a previous engagement.
Oh, you're the ones with the boat. - Exactly.
we're sorry, we coincidentally ran into a fellow student of mine - and just couldn't say "no." - The offer still stands!
definitely, but I have so little time, I'm working on the island, a reconstruction.
Chris is an architect. - Interesting!
I really didn't recognize you, nice dress. - Thanks.
maybe it's just the makeup. - No, it's everything.
I really wasn't sure of myself!
the offer still stands! - That's totally nice of you.
I would've loved to go on a boat trip again.
well then...
Bye. - Bye.
what are your ideas for the villa?
I have 1, 000 ideas.
I thought I'd tear it down and ask him afterwards how he wants it.
I'll be finished in a minute.
I'm so afraid of losing you.
don't answer like that.
how should I answer?
I love you?
I'd do anything for you.
I'll never leave you.
something like that?
Yes.
what are you doing?
I want them to be afraid of what we're going to do with them.
what's that?
it's spooky.
nobody would understand this.
but we understand it.
it's somehow not funny.
please.
I don't think it's funny.
Hans wants to name her Basmati if it's a girl.
Brunhilde!
we were thinking of inviting the neighbors...
we're so sorry, we just couldn't find it.
you look good!
here's a small gift. - Thanks.
that looks just like the other bunker.
nonsense, it's a hillside location. I'm worried about you.
it's nice to see you again.
Yes.
it suits you well.
Thanks.
man, was I drunk! If you told me we were here, I'd believe you in a second.
did you talk to him again? - Yes, we're negotiating.
I hope I gave you good advice in my drunken state.
make sure you don't get lost in the architecture scene here, okay?
it could be really interesting. - Really?
the guy's not that bad.
it's totally cute here.
you went to a lot of trouble.
that looks really good.
Thanks.
it's really good!
a perversely good sauce!
you can really cook!
come into my wigwam, wigwam. And relax with me!
rainbow Johnny, Rainbow Johnny. Let's be happy together!
rainbow Johnny, Rainbow Johnny. Don't ever leave me again!
that's why I love him!
enough!
sure, a little piece.
this is our official reconciliation. You've done well.
it tasted great.
where did you learn that?
maybe I can send Sana there, too.
what's your profession? We didn't ask you and have been speculating for days.
I work for Universal, the music label, in public relations.
I mediate between bands and journalists.
Gitti's dealing with The Shames. - Who?
the Shames, a young band. - Shames...
right, you told us about that...
sana bet you're a photographer.
I bet "kindergarten teacher" after my experience with you.
Gitti would be an unconventional kindergarten teacher.
do you want to tell it? About Rebecca?
how should I tell that?
Gitti taught my sister's daughter how to shoot someone.
Rebecca wanted nothing to do with us, but we had to take care of her, so Gitti was fed up and told her you have to tell someone when you hate them.
first she taught her to say, "I hate you."
then Gitti let Rebecca shoot her.
she told her to use a pistol and then fell dead into the pool.
my sister was totally horrified.
cute.
unconventional indeed.
now what have you been hiding from us?
wow, it's totally wild here!
I want a tour of the house! - Hans...
what are you doing?
and this is your pleasure grotto?
your parents' bedroom? And you sleep here?
Yes.
I always wanted one of these.
Gitti changes behind that.
my therapist told me not to overdo it and said that I should use a sheet for the hard stuff.
what in heaven's name is that?
my mother collects this crap.
don't be so mean.
what's mean about that?
not that, Chris. - Why? My mother loves showing this.
my mother's paradise!
wow, how enchanting!
crazy.
they're made of glass, right? - That's perverse, isn't it?
Hans, come over with your ax some day...
goodness, how sweet!
No!
my God! - Don't touch!
open it up.
there's something in every one!
read it aloud.
"life isn't enough," said the butterfly.
"you need freedom, sunshine and a little flower."
Hans Christian Andersen. - I'm going to throw up.
it's so touching, I feel like crying.
it's so full of yearning here.
and what does she do here? - Daydream...
cool stereo.
Oh, no, come on.
it's Grǒnemeyer!
I used to be a total Grǒnemeyer fan!
goodness.
I'm sorry, people, but this is torture.
can I help you? - No.
are you crazy?
I have the feeling you'll fly in tonight. - I don't think so.
you'll see, my love. You haven't swum all day.
you'll fit in there perfectly.
I didn't know your parents were so rich.
they're not. They just chose the wrong pool size.
I'm a bit envious that you can work here.
Yes, you've said that already.
pregnant women are so boring!
don't you dare, stop it. - Here's dessert.
you're overdue, honey.
come on, let's eat dessert.
no, stop it... I'm pregnant...
no, Chris. Please don't!
you're assholes.
what assholes.
so, do you have a towel for me?
know what?
go upstairs and tell them you're sick because you're pregnant and you want to go home.
well, Gitti, thanks for the delicious roast.
you definitely have to give Sana a cooking class.
Bye, see you soon.
take care.
thanks a lot for the nice invitation.
sure. Thanks for coming.
I'm sorry.
I'm going inside.
there you are.
aren't you cold? - No.
wait.
I love you so much.
I don't want to go to the beach, I'm tired.
you can sleep on the beach.
go ahead, I'll be there in a bit.
come on, it's beautiful there.
no, I'm going back.
Yes, he told me that, too.
right.
just call me later a couple of times and say you need me urgently next week.
I'll tell you later.
Yes, you'll have to tell me all about it.
then call me tomorrow when you know more, okay?
Bye.
who was that? - Daphne.
they're stressed out and will probably need me sooner.
they'll call me back tomorrow.
that's not what you just said.
I don't love you anymore.
I'm flying home.
can you talk to me?
what were you trying to pull on the phone?
why don't you love me anymore?
no reason.
I don't believe you.
because you're a weakling.
that doesn't hurt me.
then why did you sleep with me without a condom?
don't worry, I won't have a child with you.
you want me to pretend to be a guy who reconstructs villas and invites you to dinner? How courageous!
you want your life to be easy and fun!
you tell me to take risks?
you sit there in your damned sweatpants and give me clever advice!
what are your ideals, anyway?
you only watch me or change your clothing style.
don't you think you're desperate, too, when you hop about like Sana?
I just wanted to see if you liked it. - I don't like it.
I know you love me.
I'm sorry that you think that.
there are tears in your eyes.
because I feel sorry for you!
you really think I'm that ridiculous? - Yes.
if I'm such a pitiful guy, you should really leave.
what is this?
Gitti, is everything alright?
what's wrong?
stop jerking me around.
I don't know what you're trying to tell me.
yes?
Hi, Daphne, this is Chris.
no, she's not here. She's at the beach.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Yes, she will.
Bye.
that was Daphne, she wants a return call.
but you already know that.
can you please stop?
can you stop this show?
what is this crap?
look at me.
but why, Mi-young?
don't whine! Let's not be melodramatic, okay?
listen to me.
I know I'm not the kind of guy most girls dreams of.
I'm not rich and don't have a flashy future ahead of me, but...
that's what I hate!
I want a rich man with a great future.
Mi-young, don't do this.
you know how much I love you.
I've never cheated on you.
that doesn't help.
am I the only girl on earth?
Mi-young, please...
tell me what you want. I'll change.
my heart has changed.
you just don't excite me anymore.
should I cheat to excite you?
come on, don't overdo it.
if you leave me...
I will kill myself.
go ahead! You call yourself a man?
Bye!
Mi-young...
you really broke up? - Yes!
he begged me to stay.
you're the one who cheated. Why should he beg?
because he was the one who didn't want to break up.
when will you stop breaking hearts?
when I find a man to break mine!
you're unbelievable, Mi-young.
you're way too picky.
that's shopping, not love.
shopping isn't love. But love is like shopping.
you shop around for a deal.
sometimes you have to try it on before you purchase it.
you're still a virgin, aren't you, Sun-young?
Hey!
for a 27-year-old girl, virginity isn't just a decoration.
there's no age limit, is there?
how will you ever find love?
you need a man for that, but you never date.
love comes...
love comes like thunder, or like a thief?
when will the thunder rumble? When will the thief break in?
still waiting for a prince on a white horse?
princes don't like your type.
take Snow White, Cinderella...
... and Sleeping Beauty.
snow White was a tramp, fooling around with 7 dwarves.
Cinderella crashed a party to hook up with a prince.
and Sleeping Beauty met one while sleeping in the woods.
it's not some prince I want.
but...
Yes, a thrill!
the nerve cells coming alive...
and all the senses converge into one part of the body...
you know what that's called?
what?
an orgasm!
come on!
what's this?
a mushroom.
what does it look like?
like a mushroom.
you know what else it looks like?
look.
going in and out like this...
it takes the impurities out of a girl's body.
sex is good for a girl's cleanliness.
that's nonsense!
I read it in the paper.
sexless girls...
they run a higher risk of getting uterine cancer.
Really? -Yes!
so it's unhealthy to live without sex like you do.
smells great!
mom.
isn't this mushroom soup?
that's right. - What?!
what's wrong with you? So lewd!
lewd?
why is soup lewd?
of all soups, you had to make mushroom soup?
what's wrong with it?
whatever!
I'm not eating it.
why so bitchy this morning?
you'd rather eat clam soup?
what clam...
has she started her period?
no.
everybody Has Secrets
not a single hottie tonight.
Where's my Mr. Hunk?
too cheesy.
Wow!
he has style.
he's cute and sexy.
he's perfect. Just my type.
Hey, get away from him!
I saw him first.
ready to order?
the singer takes orders too?
it depends.
here's the menu.
what the heck is he doing?
I'm ashame
is he one of those wine-sipping stuck-ups?
be a man and go for tequila.
a bottle of tequila please.
Oh, you like tequila?
anything to go with it?
what do you recommend?
we have great steaks. Very juicy.
fruit please.
how'd he know I hate yes-men?
only the last love of a woman can satisfy the first love of a man." - Balzac
I should go work on him.
here.
leaving? - Yes. I had a good time.
can I have your business card?
so I can invite you when we throw parties.
hold on.
Mr. Naive, huh?
that's my number.
Thanks. - Bye.
you're a good singer.
Thanks.
Bye.
sun-young, it's the feeling.
I knew he was the one the moment I saw him.
you say that about every guy that you meet.
it's real this time!
he's on his way.
here? - Yeah, he's picking me up.
wow, yummy!
my mother liked these.
so I got some for you.
nice to meet you.
su-hyeon, right? - Yes.
let me introduce my family.
Jin-young, my first daughter.
how are you? - Pleased to meet you.
her husband. He's a doctor.
Hi, I'm Choi Su-hyeon. - Good to meet you.
good thing you're a doctor. I've been needing a checkup.
I'm a gynecologist.
she's Ye-sul, my granddaughter.
Hi. - Hi.
su-hyeon, I'll be right back. - Okay.
you have beautiful eyes, Ye-sul.
you too.
I do?
Thanks.
su-hyeon, come here. - Okay.
Dae-young, my youngest child.
sun-young, my second daughter. She's a bookworm.
Su-hyeon
mom, where's Su-hyeon?
sorry to keep you waiting. - No problem.
are you ready? - Let's go.
see you later.
Bye, Mom. - Come by anytime.
it was nice meeting you.
he's gorgeous, isn't he?
Yeah.
nothing like those guys you usually date.
he's not just different.
he's like a character in a novel.
I think he reads a lot too.
like what?
he quoted Ko Jung-hee.
when did you guys talk?
while you were upstairs.
not many know that poet.
gosh, he's cute and intelligent.
isn't he too perfect?
he seems very nice, but...
you know what? Don't trust him too much.
why not?
guys all seem nice at first.
but as time goes by, they change.
no way!
I like him more each day.
all I am saying is...
not everything is what it seems.
sun-young, are you jealous?
give me a break. Why would I be jealous?
she's not even capable of jealousy.
what if she finds out that I'm in love like a lightning bolt?
am I going to see some love this time?
I don't know.
by the way, how about you?
what?
is sex still good?
you know what he says?
no sex with a wife.
he says it feels almost like committing incest.
he looks at naked women all day at the hospital.
I bet he doesn't want to see one at home.
want to come in? - No, I have to go.
go ahead. - Okay. Bye, Jin-young.
Su-hyeon.
Mi-young. - Huh?
I don't want to hide my feelings any more.
don't. You shouldn't.
honestly...
I want to have you.
but only when you're ready.
I was just playing innocent. - Whenever...
keep going!
wherever you want it.
heartbreaking
what's wrong with him? He's so moody.
everything's wrong with him.
he doesn't know how to win a girl's heart.
Mi-young.
what? - You know what?
you don't have to come back to me.
but can't you be nicer to me?
it'll only make things worse for you.
I know. I really do.
but it's just so hard.
please, warm my heart.
please.
are you sure?
warm now?
God... hot...
Jin-young, you just got home?
did Su-hyeon leave?
Hi, Mi-young.
Hi, Su-hyeon.
what were you doing?
I was about to leave
I'm almost done here. Can you pick me up?
OK, coming soon
okay.
can you believe it?
I've never felt this way about anybody before.
you know what we did last weekend?
great date?
I was kidnapped.
Oh my Godness
what's going on?
su-hyeon, where are we going?
it won't be fun if I tell you.
I'll take care of you today. To the right.
taken somewhere blindfolded...
I was so excited!
get in.
watch your legs.
feeling the speed with my eyes blindfolded...
it was awesome!
like having an orgasm, my whole body tingled.
I was going crazy!
the place he took me...
it was a beautiful cottage overlooking the sea.
so romantic, isn't it?
what girl would say no in such a situation?
he didn't just give me love.
for the first time...
he made me feel destined to love.
thank you!
I have my whole family here tonight.
it's my mom's birthday.
thank you.
to me, she's my best friend.
I'm wondering what to get her for her birthday...
Hey. - What?
chicks like jewelry and clothes, don't they?
not our boss, moron.
she's been a widow for 1 0 years.
what she needs is a young stud.
a young stud?!
I've decided to present her with a new family member.
see that good-looking man sitting by my mom?
she's crazy about him.
and so is he about her.
with a 10-year widow...
he's done for.
he's the man I'm in love with.
she's giving her mom her boyfriend?
they must be real close, sharing a guy.
wait, wait.
I haven't asked him yet.
but I will now.
Su-hyeon.
will you marry me?
she's an lndian giver!
that's what happens when they share guys.
Oh, I see.
you don't know shit!
no, this isn't right.
shouldn't I be the one proposing?
Mi-young, will you marry me?
"love appears like thunder and disappears like fog." - Doppler
Hi.
Hi.
I've heard a lot about you.
you have?
ingeborg Bachmann, right?
what?
he knows her?
if you like Bachmann, you must like Ko Jung-hee, too.
you know her, too?
I love her poems.
"Invocation of the spirit of a deceased" Spring in Mt. Jiri
everything that disappears leaves emptiness behind
few people know those poems.
you're a lover of poetry?
Yes.
have you read any plays by Bachmann?
my favorite is...
the Good God of Manhattan.
I heard you're writing your Master's thesis.
I'm working on it.
what's it going to be about?
the periodical characteristics of poems.
but I haven't decided on the period yet.
better yet...
why don't you focus on one thing?
like brothel literature.
brothel...
you mean prostitutes?
but all they wrote about was men and their...
some lived provocative and sexually active lives.
like who?
it's your job to find out.
use your imagination.
that imaginative power of yours that nobody knows of.
mom, where's Su-hyeon?
sorry to keep you waiting.
are you ready? - Let's go.
see you later.
Bye, Mom. - Come by anytime.
it was nice meeting you.
what's he doing here?
what am I doing?
I didn't do anything wrong.
sun-young?
Hi.
Hi.
what are you doing here?
that book we talked about...
what?
the Good God of Manhattan.
I heard this library carries it.
I see.
you're here for your thesis?
I come here often.
what? - I meant yes!
you were... gone like the wind.
my father liked this song.
una Furtiva Lagrima.
it's an aria from L'Elisir d'Amore by Donizetti.
Thanks.
when I was eleven...
I caught my father crying, listening to this.
you're confused, aren't you?
I was very much so back then.
he was a sentimental person.
when I turned 1 8...
he told me to get a driver's license.
so I did.
when I came home with my license, this car was there...
but my father was gone.
what?
gone where?
he'd disappeared.
without...
without a word...
I... I miss him so much.
don't cry.
not a word from him since.
he must've died somewhere alone.
that makes me sad.
I miss my daddy too!
you stole my heart like a thief.
do you realize that?
come on, he's not a thief!
su-hyeon, join our family and...
fool!
what are we, the mob?!
you wetly drenched my heart like streaks of rain...
God, it's so corny!
it failed me.
my brain failed me.
have you gone insane?
huh?
stop eating my soup. Eat yours.
you have to stop reading books. Get a date or something.
see how happy Mi-young is with Su-hyeon.
should I set you up with my friend's son?
he's a neurologist.
you mixed rice in the soy sauce!
he smokes pot and dances with the phantom of his dead lover?
I never knew classical ballet could be so twisted.
marijuana is just a device to portray the suppressed desires...
and the sufferings resulting from them.
you don't get it?
Yeah, too deep for me.
what the... since when?
been a while.
you're gonna smoke that? - No way.
it's just for show.
Oh my God!
my professor is here!
what should I do?
I'll be back.
professor?
Oh, you're early. - Yes.
the topic of your thesis changed dramatically.
I was quite surprised.
you don't like it?
that's not it.
I was wondering what made you change your mind.
the shifting of one's thoughts being like thunder...
... or like a thief.
when Nikiya gets bitten by a poisonous snake...
she refuses to love the Brahman in return for the antidote.
what do you mean it's a prearranged choice?
loving a man she shouldn't, she risks her life.
to liberate her suppressed ego...
she chooses death, giving up her physical body.
look.
that's what makes her love so beautiful.
that's an amazing interpretation.
only by becoming truthful to her desire for love...
does she achieve true love.
sun-young!
wait!
what do you think?
so pretty.
will he be okay with it?
it's quite revealing.
he won't be okay with the price.
sun-young! - Yikes!
I just saw Su-hyeon.
where?
he went upstairs, but he's coming back down.
he gestured that he would.
that's good. I haven't seen him for a while.
wait.
why isn't he coming?
he must be busy shopping.
he said he'd come right down.
why are you fidgeting?
why isn't he coming?!
sun-young!
you're standing in the way.
let go.
what's wrong with you?
what's going on?
he told me he'd come down!
I can't believe him!
where the hell is he?!
sun-young!
you know, Su-hyeon is...
him again?
doesn't he seem to have a sad past?
like Werther or Hamlet...
he's a man of a pure soul...
Iiving in his sorrow.
well, I think... - I'm right!
you're married and incapable of feeling such sentiment.
when he cried...
he looked so sad.
he cried?
you saw him crying?
no... I'm just guessing.
you met him, didn't you?
What?!
you think I'm seeing him behind Mi-young's back?
why are you getting upset?
did I say you did?
but it sounded like...
... you did.
just eat, okay?
what are you doing? - God!
Hey!
why so surprised?
where are you manners? You should've knocked!
I'm your sister. I can't come in without knocking?
it's called "privacy'!
stop yelling at me.
who were you talking to?
why does that concern you?
to the dog next door, so what?!
why do I always have to yield to you?
food, clothes...
I even have to use the bathroom after you!
what's wrong with you?
I won't yield anymore.
sun-young!
what's wrong? What did you say to her?
nothing.
I was just going to tell her that it's raining.
what's her problem?
Hello?
sun-young?
how'd you know it was me?
I've been waiting for your call.
you saw me at the department store, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
what happened?
you gestured you would come down.
where are you?
it's not important!
it is.
can you come over now? - What?
it will keep you warm.
I don't drink.
have some tea then.
I'll drink it.
I think a lot about you.
Really?
once...
never mind.
what is it?
no, I shouldn't tell you.
come on!
tell me.
you'll think badly of me once I do.
I won't. Tell me what it is.
I promise I won't, okay?
please tell me what it is.
we're cool, aren't we?
you can tell me anything.
I mean it!
making love to Mi-young...
I wished she'd been you.
see? I shouldn't have said it.
wait a second. - Sure.
believe it or not...
I've never done it before.
but...
we can kiss some more.
sleep well?
good morning!
you feel better now? - Sure.
sorry about last night.
I'm glad you are.
Mi-young, are things good with Su-hyeon?
I think so.
but he's been strange lately.
Why? Has he changed?
that's not it.
I often find him lost deep in thought.
and he sometimes stares at me without saying a single word.
keep your eyes on him. He might cheat on you.
you know he'd never do that.
this is it. - Right, he'd never do that.
Mi-young, this is reality.
try to embrace it.
Su-hyeon doesn't love you any more.
you can drink this.
Oh God...
sun-young, eat! - Jesus!
okay!
aren't you eating?
no way!
where are you taking me?
it won't be fun if I tell you. To the right.
I will take care of you today.
I'm so curious.
watch your legs.
are you good?
su-hyeon, where are we going?
where are you? Are you there?
I can't wait.
tell me where we're going. Don't keep me guessing.
if you don't answer me now, I'll take this off.
let's go.
where are we going?
see that good-looking man sitting by my mom?
she's crazy about him.
so is he about her.
he's the man I'm in love with.
wait, wait.
I haven't asked him yet.
Su-hyeon.
will you marry me?
no, this isn't right.
shouldn't I be the one proposing?
Mi-young, will you marry me?
don't do this, Sun-young.
go.
you should be with your fiancee.
Sun-young. - Everything's clear now.
I love you, but you're marrying Mi-young.
I'm left with a broken heart.
you're an asshole!
Sun-young.
what was I thinking?!
after you stepped into my life, everything got mixed up.
it's a total mess!
Sun-young.
calm down and listen.
do you think you can love only one person?
Solor marries Princess Gamzati.
so he doesn't love Nikiya?
this isn't some novel.
this is reality.
do you love Mi-young?
I do.
let me ask you one thing.
answer me carefully.
did you want to marry me?
were you just having fun with me?
I had to say what I said.
but what really counts is...
it's my heart.
leaving Mi-young alone...
I'm with you at this very moment.
can't you see that?
are you...
sun-young!
I'll do it.
what's next?
should I turn off the light? - No!
don't.
I can wait. We'll do it when you're ready.
turn off the light.
relax. Loosen up.
okay.
Oh God!
what?
do I have to do this?
you're supposed to?
I think so.
it gives guys pleasure.
says who?
I read it in a book.
come here.
you were fantastic.
Really?
really!
you liked it?
did you?
was it the same as described in the book?
are you making fun of me?
forget about the book. Follow your feelings this time.
again?
too much sex isn't good for men.
the book says so? - Yes.
when guys ejaculate, they lose protein.
ejaculating is like running a lap around the track...
or playing hoops for 1 5 minutes...
Sun-young.
you don't have to do it every time we have sex.
Oh... I don't?
what?
Sun-young.
not coming?
what do you think makes life fun?
it's just fun, and it's raining!
mi-young didn't come home the other night.
she didn't?
this guy she's been seeing took her to an island.
to an island? Why?
isn't it obvious? What do you think they did?
that's all you think about. You're like a pervert.
come on, it's not a crime. They're adults.
so are we.
no way.
no sex before marriage. Never!
we live in the 21 st century.
virginity isn't a big deal anymore.
don't even think about it!
what?
nothing.
problems with your girlfriend?
God, you're good!
you like her, don't you?
sure, absolutely.
but...
can I call you "brother"?
after you zip up your fly.
when I suck on her neck...
her legs shake like crazy.
like a dog wagging its tail when you touch its neck.
and when we were alone the other day...
she let me touch her tits.
that was it.
nothing more.
she wouldn't let me touch her down there.
so I told her in such a romantic way.
romantically...
Eun-mi, I love you.
l wanna show you my love... in every possible way.
that's a good line, isn't it?
you're bad.
how about this?
although I want to show you my love...
I'll wait until your heart opens.
better, isn't it?
what if it never opens?
then...
l can wait for eternity.
I'm just happy being with you.
that will do it.
can you write that down for me?
better yet, help me get laid.
wash your hands.
you'll help me, won't you?
here you go.
when did you learn to cook?
you're so cool.
here.
I'm not much of a drinker.
you call yourself a man? Finish it!
God!
you know how I like it. Fill it up please.
I'll sleep on the couch.
that's right! You like sleeping on the couch.
I totally forgot.
let me get you a blanket.
brother...
am I a monster?
or...
do I smell that bad?
she'd rather sleep on the couch than in the bed with me.
can you believe that?
but she seems to like you as much as you like her.
you think so? - Yes.
what's her problem then?
be patient. You can't force her into it.
love is a delicate thing.
you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.
abraham Lincoln.
good analogy!
you've got a better shape than I thought.
your chest is so muscular.
you've got six-pack abs... Not.
geez, what's up with this?
you're attractive.
ack, I'm getting a semi-stiffy.
so tight.
only the brave win the beauty.
am I becoming gay? Oh God!
I think I'm going to bed.
want to drink some more with me?
no, I'm beat.
you're a bed hog. I like sleeping on the edge.
sleep tight, Dae-young.
see! Come sleep closer to this side.
I'm okay. I like sleeping on the floor.
sorry, Eun-mi...
I think I love someone else.
crazy wench! What a flatter!
that bastard!
he turned me gay
Daeyoung I didn't know you were that sweet.
why didn't you tell me?
what?
Su-hyeon told me everything.
I never knew how much you cared for me.
I think I'm ready...
... to open my heart to you.
it's okay. It hurts the first time.
I did it!
you have something to tell me?
it's nothing serious, but...
any problems with my sis?
problems...
like what?
do you guys keep things from each other?
is there a couple on earth without secrets?
Why?
nothing.
let's drink.
Hi. - Where's my mom?
she's out, but will be back soon.
"Oh, Freedom! What sins are done in your name!" - Rolland Romain
what do you think?
so pretty.
will he be okay with it?
it's quite revealing.
he won't be okay with the price.
Hello? - lt looks good on you.
who's this?
you have a beautiful neck. Stop wearing turtlenecks.
who is this?!
I'm sorry. This is Choi Su-hyeon.
who?
Su-hyeon. Ring a bell?
Oh, Mi-young's boyfriend?
how'd you know I was here?
I'm here too, watching you as we speak.
from where?
it looks great on you. Buy it.
su-hyeon, wait.
Jin-young! - Yikes!
I just saw Su-hyeon.
where?
he went upstairs, but he's coming back down.
he gestured that he would.
that's good. I haven't seen him for a while.
wait.
how long was he watching me?
I have a beautiful neck?
Hi.
you showering at night scares me.
but wearing a perfume in bed? That's worse
come on!
I bought this for the party. What do you think?
isn't it too revealing?
I was told it looked good on me.
it lets my neck stand out.
don't let it go to your head.
the sales person just wanted to sell you that dress - And Su-hyeon... - What?
why so surprised?
I didn't hear you.
that means you're getting old.
did you clean your ears?
you're so disgusting.
what about him?
Su-hyeon is...
I think he's pretty loaded for his age.
ask him to invest in my hospital.
the shower?
aren't you doing it?
is she in bed?
let me go check on her.
this is Su-hyeon's gallery.
it's nice.
do you want to come in? - No, I have to go.
go ahead. - Okay. Bye, Jin-young.
Wow!
who are you?
are you my wife?
drunk already?
what's wrong with me? You look so hot tonight.
let's get it on.
stop it. They're right there!
stop drinking!
honey, let's do it tonight.
pull yourself together!
"no sex with a wife," remember?
that's right. I wasn't myself for a moment.
guess I'm drunk.
sorry, ma'am.
bored, aren't you?
no, I'm having fun.
did you buy that dress?
you have a perfect body for it.
come on, moms don't have perfect bodies.
I mean it. You're the sexiest of the three.
I know you're joking.
I hear you're going to a party on Friday.
should I baby-sit Ye-sul?
what?
no, you don't have to. - It's okay.
Ye-sul and I are friends now.
any problems?
no, no problems.
are you coming with Mi-young?
she sings at the club on Fridays.
I wanted to come early for you.
but the party dragged on.
su-hyeon, let's drink. Just you and me.
get some liquor...
heavy, isn't he?
he becomes talkative when he's drunk.
he's just a sociable person.
want some coffee?
sure.
I'll get it.
no. - Sit. I'll get it for you.
Where'd it go?
you can't see it?
what's wrong with me?
why is my heart racing?
if I turn around, will you look away again?
what?
why do you always do that?
is it that important to you what others think?
of course.
I'm married and have more to protect.
does that make you happy?
what do you mean?
I'm simply asking what makes you really happy.
when you're married...
you get to put other things before your own happiness.
Ye-sul is quite pretty, like her mom.
the time will come for her to meet a nice guy and get married.
and like her mom...
she will start forgetting how lovely she is...
unable to look into the eyes of a guy that she likes.
is that what you want?
it's none of your business. Stop it.
you have a beautiful neck.
and prettier eyes.
don't hide your beauty. Let it show.
Hello? - It's me, Jin-young.
Hey, Mi-young.
you just got home?
right.
did Su-hyeon leave?
no, he's here. Hold on.
Mi-young. - Hi, Su-hyeon.
what were you doing? - I was about to leave.
I'm almost done here. Can you pick me up?
sure, I'm on my way.
okay.
Su-hyeon.
will you marry me?
shouldn't I be the one proposing?
Mi-young, will you marry me?
Hello?
Ye-sul, play for 2 hours at the daycare, okay?
Sun-young.
not coming?
what do you think makes life fun?
it's just fun, and it's raining!
it's the unexpected that makes it so exciting.
you're wearing that to go hiking?
I'm not going.
let's go get some fresh air.
I said I'm not going!
why are you yelling at her?
mom.
should I call off the marriage?
what are you talking about?
you guys got into a fight?
I don't know!
mom.
do you think I love Su-hyeon?
I know you do. A lot.
sorry. I'm just...
nothing. I'll stay home.
what's wrong with her?
she's been sensitive lately.
right.
Thanks, Professor.
okay.
how's your thesis going?
it's been published.
professor Uhm is so supportive...
that others are going easy on me.
Oh my...
so pretty!
you're so beautiful. - lsn't she?
how about? - You're gorgeous.
Jin-young, it's so weird.
what?
I feel so nervous and edgy.
someone's here to see the bride.
I'll go.
Oh God, Sang-il!
Hi.
I have something for Mi-young.
you do?
Thanks.
I'll make sure she gets it.
can l...
can I give it to her in person?
that's...
she's kind of busy right now.
I'm sure.
but it won't take long.
that's not a good idea. I'll give it to her, okay?
but - Bye.
it's the necklace that you've always wanted.
you had to do this, didn't you?
I can't believe you got me a wedding present.
why don't you wish me a good marriage too?
be happy.
I know you will.
Mi-young...
I ran into him at the pool.
and we drank a little together.
forget it.
it's not like you slept with him. That's no big deal.
I did.
your hair!
and...
I loved it.
Mi-young, calm down.
listen carefully.
do you love Su-hyeon, or not?
I do.
what about Sang-il?
I think I love him too.
the thing is...
I don't love him the same as I love Su-hyeon.
but it's definitely love.
what should I do?
which one do you want to marry?
you can love both, but you can't marry both.
I have no idea.
if you don't, who does?
I don't know!
but I know I will regret it if I marry Su-hyeon today.
I should tell him.
are you crazy?!
it's not something you can discuss over the phone.
right, calm down first.
I really don't know.
your hair!
women & Sex
can we talk?
come on in.
is it a disease, loving more than one person at a time?
because you've given it to Mi-young.
you slept with Sun-young, too, didn't you?
want some tea?
you love both Mi-young and Sun-young?
what about coffee?
tell me what you have to say!
do you want to kiss me?
open up!
Oh God!
what have I done?!
you're not even dressed?
Hey.
I was going to take a shower.
hurry up!
you don't wanna be late for your wedding - Thanks for coming. - Hi.
is Han Sun-young here?
she's my sister.
I see.
Hi, I'm Professor Uhm, Sun-young's academic adviser.
Oh, I've heard a lot about you.
I'll take you to her.
okay.
your professor is here.
how are you?
good. How about you?
I'm good, too.
Jin-young, hold on.
what? - Something's on your back.
odd, what was that doing there?
Mi-young!
I can't believe this!
mom! - Let me talk to her.
Mi-young!
Jin-young, I can't marry him.
you can't do this now.
I can't make up my mind.
it's your wedding day!
let me talk to her.
Mi-young, look at me.
Su-hyeon. - Yes?
I have something to tell you.
frankly...
I have a secret.
I really... - Wait.
you don't have to tell me.
who doesn't have secrets?
you think I don't?
but...
there's no rush here.
follow your heart.
wherever that secret of yours may lead you...
the marriage comes after that.
Thanks, Su-hyeon.
everybody has secrets.
they don't make you happy, but you can have them to be happy
I gave each of them a secret to keep, and they became that much happier
it's over. We're breaking up.
honey, but why?
don't whine! Let's not be melodramatic, okay?
what don't you like about me? I can have it fixed.
what do you have left to fix?
you had your whole face done. Eyes, nose, mouth, and jaw!
aren't I pretty enough for you?
no.
I'm very concerned about the children I'll have.
don't worry about it.
we'll have him or her fixed too.
my hospital will give us 50% discount
easier said than done!
find a guy in your league.
know your place!
let's find a cosy spot where no one can see.
just us...just we.
we've missed an awful lot what bliss it'll be!
Oh gee!
what are your charms for?
what are my arms for?
use your imagination!
just you...just me.
we'll tie a lover's knot just say you love me.
just he...
just she.
and what a perfect plot...
just say you love me.
Oh gee!
Oh my!
it's finally springtime, birds-on-the-wing time, and what a lovely day for love.
just me...just you.
just you...just me.
a bit of paradise...right here for us two.
just you...
just me.
let's find a cosy spot, where no one can see.
just us...
just the two of us...
just we...mighty few of us.
we've missed an awful lot what bliss it'll be!
just you...just me.
we'll tie a lover's knot just say you love me.
that's my sister Skylar and her boyfriend Holden.
and that's me.
I'm Djuna: D-J-U-N-A.
everyone calls me DJ.
I'm gonna level with you.
we're not the typical family from a musical comedy.
for one thing, we got dough.
and we live on Park Avenue in a penthouse apartment.
dad's a lawyer. I mean, I call him 'Dad', but really he's 'Stepdad.'
because there's original Dad, right...? who married Mom, and they had me.
and then there's Stepdad, who had 2 kids with his first wife...
okay, look, maybe this is getting confusing for you.
you see, there's Lane and Laura.
my half-sisters. They're great.
a little twitty at times, but...
we love each other and have a million laughs together.
and my stepbrother Scott, who's very smart, but he's in trouble with the family because he's a Republican, which made my stepfather have a stroke, since we're Democrats.
how do you expect people on welfare to develop initiative?
you mean someone who can't work should just be discarded?
welfare does not work. It's the same liberal fantasy world as not allowing school prayer and coddling criminals.
I can't believe I'm having this talk with my own son.
unless Republican pods in the basement took over your body.
not pods, Dad.
ideas. Virile, modern ideas.
a strong America. The right to bear arms.
arms? Guns?
are you crazy? What's up with you? I just don't understand you!
relax.
excuse me. Steffi, bring down a copy of my will and an eraser.
if Dad's a Liberal Democrat, then Mom's even more extreme.
she's a guilty Liberal Democrat.
he grew up poor and knows what it's like to work like a dog.
mom came from money and luxury and spends all her time doing volunteer work for everybody.
she's with the Civil Liberties Union and Save the Whales, and raises dough for the Whitney museum and the hospital...
and she's always doing something...
like throwing some chic soirée to help the N. Y. Philharmonic.
lane and Laura go to Nightingale, a ritzy school on 92nd street.
white truffles are so much better than dark truffles.
my God!
my God, there he is!
he's so gorgeous. - Who is he?
we don't know. We always see him round here.
she's in love from afar.
we'll find a way to get her to meet him.
please, no humiliating schemes.
my mom is in with a patient.
Claire's their best friend. Her mom's a shrink.
years ago, Claire drilled a hole in the wall.
we get our kicks after school by tuning in on her clientele.
I've been having these fantasies about other men and...
it makes me feel...bad, and...guilty.
I had that elevator dream again, and...
I'm in the elevator and it just keeps going up and up and up.
now you must meet Grandpa, 88 years old.
found him at Grand Central. He thought he was in the park.
you must watch him.
last year he wandered out in a towel and got in line in Times Square.
we sent Frieda to get him back.
she's our maid. I think she was Hitler's maid at Berchtesgaden.
but she's the only one who can handle Grandpa.
I found your arch supports in the stew. How did they get there?
finally, there's my dad, who lives in Paris, but visits a lot.
he and my stepdad are great friends.
I think he still loves Mom, though they've been divorced for years.
they're all friends, and they come to each other with their problems.
I can't believe it. Giselle left me.
look at this face.
she suddenly left me with my best friend.
no warning?
nothing. The two of them... Did you ever see anyone so...?
I'm so distraught, over this, I can't tell you.
I'll kill myself.
I'll go back to Paris and jump off the Eiffel Tower. I'll be dead.
if I get the Concorde, I could be dead 3 hours earlier.
or, wait a minute...
with the time change...
I could be alive 6 hours in New York, but dead 3 hours in Paris.
I could get things done, and also be dead.
you didn't see the signs. She must have given you some signs.
you think I'm an idiot?
what kind of signs? Finding his photo in her underwear drawer?
or saying his name as she climaxed?
I don't mean that. - No, that's what happened.
I just couldn't put it together.
I'm glad you didn't marry her. I told you, "Don't do it."
I'd have been happy to.
I'm really glad. Want some wine or something?
anything. I must have a drink.
you know what's sad?
I thought everything was going well, that things were...
you always pick the wrong women.
I picked you. - We got divorced.
you were impossible to live with.
I was impossible? I love this!
you couldn't decide whether to be a psychoanalyst or a writer.
so I compromised. I became a writer and a patient.
wail find you someone. We know a lot of people.
I've been trying since we got divorced to find him someone.
someone to match his personality.
but I'm begining...Honey, bring another glass!
I'm wondering if the world female population isn't too limited.
thank you. -Well! I mean that...
you've had rotten luck. - No, he hasn't.
he makes rotten choices.
but does he want to spend his golden years with someone?
why my golden years?
you must think about those things.
men age different to women. 2 more years, I'll look like your son.
that was so mean!
don't you laugh.
that's not funny. - She's got me in a home already.
look, what about Madeline, after me?
she was an archaeologist. She was fabulous.
she was a nymphomaniac.
okay, she had a problem with fidelity.
I didn't happen to see it. But she was brilliant.
what about Carol? What was her last name?
Carol was a poet and a member of Mensa.
she was a heroin addict.
Yes, but I thought it was insulin!
you know what the problem is? Listen.
this is the problem!
he's still in love with you. I always said this.
who can blame him? Of course he is.
that's the problem. - Come here, my two men.
I'm pining after Giselle.
wail find someone.
I don't know if we will.
we will. I know. - This is the problem.
what's all the secrecy? Why Harry Winston's?
I want you to help me pick an engagement ring for Skylar.
Congratulations.
you want an engagement ring.
right, we're getting married. Or I am, not to her.
I see. What size did you have in mind?
what size?
well, I know she's not huge.
she's not bony, either.
something simple but elegant? - That's it.
simple but elegant. Exactly. I told you he was the guy.
like this one.
God, that's beautiful.
it's perfect.
it's the most beautiful ring I ever saw.
what would that cost? I like it.
$55, 000
$55, 000, you said?
let me take it off then, because I don't think...
actually, as I look at it...it's not to Skylar's taste. It's tacky.
she's not a Mafia bride. Help me.
here's a lovely one.
that is pretty.
what'll it cost me? $1, 500? $2, 000?
8000.0
it's more in the ballpark, in the right neighbourhood.
not my neighbourhood, but... - It's a better neighbourhood.
what the hell, right? We're getting married.
let's do it.
I think it's an absolutely exquisite ring.
my baby don't care for rings or other expensive things.
my baby just cares for me.
my baby don't go for big Rolls-Royces.
there's sometimes a doubt about her choices.
my baby don't care to own some 14-carat stone.
she's sensible as can be.
my baby don't care who knows it.
my baby just cares for me.
he's so happy since the day he fell in love in a real big way.
and the big surprise is someone loves him too.
it's difficult for us to see just what she could possibly see in he.
but it simply goes to prove what love can do.
his baby don't care for shows.
his baby don't care for clothes.
my baby just cares for me!
nobody else will do!
his baby don't care for furs and laces.
his baby don't care for races or high-toned places.
my baby's not much for sports... - Gets out of sorts.
like running round tennis courts.
I must say I'm glad that she...
he's glad to say that she has made such a fine selection.
my baby just cares for me!
my baby just cares for me!
his baby just cares for...
my baby just cares for me!
Mrs Holden Spence.
Skylar Spence. I love it.
he's taking her to Le Cirque tonight.
no kidding? - I think he's going to propose.
and I introduced them.
we've heard it, Dad.
I did. He came to work at our law firm.
the first day I said: This kid's great. His feet are on the ground. He's perfect for her.
frieda, the pasta has no sauce.
Bavarian pasta doesn't need sauce.
italian pasta needs sauce. The italians were weak.
fine. Give me some pepper.
your solution to rampant crime is just to let criminals go free?
no. Charles Ferry deserves a parole.
you want someone like this out on the streets?
armed robbery, assault, attempted escape.
he was an abused child. - Have some compassion.
he went to prison for life because of his horrible childhood.
something you know nothing about.
then one mistake... - Are you kidding?
a bad trial, corrupt judges...
calm down, both of you.
I don't want to discuss this. - I can't listen to this.
I need my wallet. - Where're you going?
the Polo Grounds. Giants and Cardinals are playing.
you can't go out. If you want to take a walk, go with Frieda.
but they're playing today, Labour Day.
it's June, Grandpa.
the Polo Grounds closed years ago.
rained out? - Take him for a short walk.
no, I'm not going with Frieda.
no, no, not with her. I don't need a German Shepherd.
take a nice walk.
you know what the kids say?
they think Holden's giving a surprise to Skylar tonight.
if you keep gossiping about it, it won't be a surprise.
I told you not to tell.
I'm going out. If Minnie calls, tell her I'm at the Polo Grounds.
Minnie's been dead 20 years.
I'm not arguing that. But if she calls, I'll be home later.
21 is too young to get married.
if this was anyone but Holden, I'd be against it.
no way I'm getting married till I'm 35.
then I'll probably live with a woman.
why do you make these jokes?
you like Holden, right?
the problem is Skylar. She's a romantic twit.
Holden's not romantic enough for her.
so what? She's going to marry him, right?
I hope so. I want her room when she does.
she should leap at this guy.
Skylar suffers from white knight syndrome.
since her hormones kicked in, she's hoped for some charismatic guy to sweep her off her feet.
so Holden is that young Lochinvar, all right?
he's a young schnook.
he's a schnook, but he's a loveable schnook.
what an endorsement! I'm never bringing a guy home.
in the first place, he's not a schnook.
I'm a dreamer...
aren't we all?
just a dreamer...
aren't we all?
in my dreams, each night it seems my sweetheart comes to call.
he's so charming, strong and tall.
it's alarming howl fall.
he's ideal.
but then he isn't real and I'm a fool.
but aren't we all?
can I tell you how I see us?
how?
we get married and we live by my parents in Sharon.
I could never leave New York.
we leave my parents in Sharon, right? We live in New York.
it's just that we may want more space if we have 4 kids.
I want two children.
two is perfect.
two is perfect for me...
because four is really a lot and you'll stay at home...
no, I'll be working.
when not working full-time. You'll have a career. Journalism.
architecture.
architecture? Since when?
I don't know, just some thoughts I've had.
I mean, you majored in journalism, but...
the important thing is that we agree on just about everything, it seems.
shall I bring the dessert, sir?
it's time for dessert? Yes, it is.
excuse me a second. I'll just tend to a small matter.
it's ready, just as you wished.
think it'll work?
that's perfect, Umberto.
glad you like it, sir.
let me show you my end of the deal.
that's a honey, huh?
set me back a bit, I don't mind saying.
I'm sure. A brilliant idea. Very romantic.
that's the kind of guy I am.
I can see that.
here we go. I'm just going to lay that right there.
will that knock her socks off?
shall we?
go ahead. I'm relying on you.
good luck.
everything okay?
no problem.
shall we order dessert? - I did.
you did?
you like take-charge guys, and I'm coming through for you.
it's not like you.
anything for you. Umberto, will you do the honours?
my God, it's delicious!
peach, my favourite flavour.
it's delicious. - What are you doing? Stop!
Where's the rest of it? - What?
the cream and the cherry!
I ate them. - You ate the ring?
what?
I bought you a diamond ring. - You did?
at Harry Winston's.
where is it?
it was on the dessert.
Why?
I thought it'd be romantic! - To put a ring on ice cream?
it wasn't my idea, it was DJ's.
she said it would give it dramatic flair.
I ate a diamond ring?
I turn round for 2 seconds and $8, 000 goes down your throat.
Oh, my God!
stay calm.
how big was it?
it was a big rock.
I swallowed what, a carat? - A karat-and-a-half.
you'd like two carrots? -I'm dying!
you're not. -Something wrong, sir?
just swallowed a little jewelry, it's all right.
how could you? - Enjoy your dinner.
how could I? Most people look at their food before plunging into it.
let me check your mouth.
this isn't much of a problem.
it's in an accessible place.
it's an absolutely beautiful ring.
a brilliant choice.
congratulations, girl.
it is beautiful.
look, she got engaged.
what is it, two karats?
One-and-a-half.
white gold?
solid platinum.
that's good.
Harry Winston's. - How much?
8000
I can get the same ring for you for 6 from my brother-in- law.
you're paying for the name. -He's a wonderful man.
am I going to scar?
doctors look at X-rays but they seldom grin.
I'm always on the outside looking in.
maybe that's why I see the funny side...
when I see a fallen brother take a bride.
weddings make a lot of people sad.
but if you're not the groom...
you're not so bad.
another bride, anothergroom...
another sunny honeymoon.
another season...
another reason for making whoopee.
a lot of shoes...
a lot of rice...
the groom is nervous...
he answers twice.
it's really killing that's he's so willing to make whoopee.
picture a little love nest down where the roses cling...
picture the same sweet love nest...
think what a year can bring.
he's washing dishes and baby clothes.
he's so ambitious...
he even sews.
but don't forget folks...
that's what you get, folks, for making whoopee.
just for making whoopee.
he's washing dishes and baby clothes.
he's so ambitious...
he even sews.
but don't forget folks...
that's what you get, folks...
summer came, and Lane and Laura got jobs at the Met, and spent weekends at the beach.
mom organised a petition for Charles Ferry's parole.
her new pet cause.
she even visited the prison and was appalled by the conditions.
what we need are open prisons.
space where the damaged human spirit can heal.
give them an opportunity to decorate their own cells with their own personal decorators.
and better cuisine.
european menus.
as for me, over the years I was used to splitting summers up...
july with Mom in New York, and August with Dad in Europe.
usually it was Paris, but this time he took me to Venice.
I think he wanted to get over memories of losing Giselle.
all I can say is if we're talking about romantic cities...
they've got the most gorgeous guys there...
and they can't keep their hands off you. It's great.
the first week was just heaven for me. Having a ball...
sailing on gondolas.
but Dad just seemed to hang around the hotel.
Giselle was still haunting him.
I'm through with love.
I'll never fall again.
said 'adieu' to love.
don't ever call again.
for I must have you or no-one.
and so I'm through with love.
I've locked my heart...
I'll keep my feelings there.
I've stocked my heart with icy frigid air.
and I mean to fall for no-one...
because I'm through with love.
I feel so guilty.
you should have fun. - I am.
I still can't figure out what went wrong with Giselle.
I always thought she was a little flighty.
want a drink? I'll have a beer.
a Bellini.
let me give you this advice.
when a relationship breaks up, and I hope they don't...
better to be the leaver than the leavee, bcause the leaver leaves.
but the leavee is left.
it's terrible.
the worst that happens to the leaver is a little survivor guilt.
survivor guilt is the worst thing that should ever happen to you.
tomorrow i'll spend with you.
it's not necessary, really.
don't turn round. That couple!
don't turn round. - Who?
I told you about her. I saw her check in the other day.
she's lovely, but I think she's married.
isn't she?
Oh, my God!
beautiful, right?
I know who she is.
you're kidding.
why didn't I think of it? She's perfect for you.
how can she be? She's married.
not happily married. You'd love her.
who is she? How'd you know her?
my friend's mother's her shrink. I know everything about her.
what's her name? - I don't know.
what do you mean?
what's wrong with you? Stop teasing me.
she's an art historian, and she's here to see the Tintorettos.
know what I'm thinking?
you've got that look on your face.
she jogs every morning. You can bump into her.
no thanks. She's married.
I'm telling you, not happily married.
complete mismatch. The guy is some actor.
he won't interfere tomorrow, he sleeps late. No problem.
you can meet her. She'll be alone. I know it for a fact.
I'm out of shape. I can't jog.
I haven't touched my treadmill in weeks.
572 weeks, that's 11 years.
stop looking at me like that. I won't do it.
we're going to get you some jogging clothes. Tomorrow...
she is really something.
you're going to jog.
sorry, are you okay?
Yes, are you all right?
do you know where the Hotel Gritti is?
I think it's that way.
over there? Because I... jogging in Venice is so...
labyrinthine.
you okay?
Yes, I'm fine. You must keep in shape. I jog every day. You?
I do.
you're American?
it's a great country.
the mountains and the prairies...
the oceans, you know, white foam and everything...
are you okay?
sit down. - No, I'm okay.
just a chest pain radiating down my arm, but...
that's your heart.
no, it's stress. I get it every other day.
what's your name?
here you are.
I was giving him directions. You okay?
you wanted to do 3 miles.
you okay?
Yes, I'm fine. - Just breathe. Breathe.
I nearly died. Couldn't breathe. Then her husband showed up.
her husband came? That's rare.
so is coronary thrombosis in our family.
did you get her name?
Von. Vonnie.
she's passionate about Tintoretto. She's writing a book about him.
she's obviously here to visit the Scuola Grande di San Rocco.
I don't know what this means. Why all these art books?
she'll be at the Scuola. He won't. They have nothing in common.
you bump into her. The groundwork's been laid. You say...
didn't we meet jogging?
the guy with the stroke. She'll remember.
then you impress her with your knowledge of her favourite painter.
you're kidding.
my art knowledge is limited to Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh.
what do I know about this?
trust me. Before we leave Venice, your lips will be pressed to hers.
unfortunately I left my Chapstick in New York.
what is this?
the rapidity of his brush strokes...
chiaroscuro.
outbursts of colour.
I told Dad everything I knew about Von.
he studied his Tintoretto book.
I told him her likes, her dislikes, her deepest feelings...
everything from her passion for Bora-Bora and Mahler's 4th to her favourite flower, the African Daisy.
I mean, everything.
when he went to the museum that day, he could've given a course on the subject.
hello again.
goodness!
you lived. How are you? I was concerned.
no, no, I was fine. I went back to the hotel and had the concierge oil my pacemaker and, you know, I...
incidentally, my name's Joe Berlin.
vonnie Sydell.
a funny coincidence. I see you here, two New Yorkers...
jogging in Venice and we bump into each other.
how'd you know I was a New Yorker?
no, I didn't. I just assumed...
but you're completely correct to ask that question.
it's a good question. You shouldn't be ashamed of it.
I live on 84th and Riverside. Where in New York do you live?
in Paris. I was a New Yorker but I settled in Paris.
but I come back to New York all the time. I love it there.
what brings you here?
I wouldn't come to Venice without checking out the Tintorettos.
because he's my favourite master in the world.
I just adore his work. I'm crazy about it.
he was a deep genius.
the deepest.
the rapidity of his brush strokes...
Chiaroscuro...
outbursts of colour...
his capacity for controlled gesture...
born in 1519, only to die again in 1594...
but that's the way it happens to most of us.
you have a real appreciation of his work.
how could I not appreciate a man who was short in stature but with a proud and obstinate nature...
who painted outside the the academic conventions of 16th century Venice?
what do you do?
call me Joe.
I'm a writer. A novelist, mostly.
Joe Berlin...
I saw one of your books.
I remember it had a very sexy cover.
it was at the stalls on 5th Avenue, the 99 cent bin.
you know, probably the get-acquainted price.
they'll do that.
in the United States I'm considered controversial...
but in Paris, where they have an ear for literature...
they were quick to recognise the genius of...
Poe and Faulkner and myself.
basically, you see, I'm a simple guy.
my idea is just to live in Paris and maybe...
you know, fall in love and...
take walks in the rain and...
listen to music like...
particularly maybe Mahler's 4th.
this could be me talking.
could it?
mahler's 4th, no question.
see, I'm not a...
what you'd call a technology guy.
I hate it.
I know, I can tell.
I still work on one of those old-fashioned portable typewriters...
so you haven't succumbed to the computer age?
I like the simple life. I like to sit at home in Paris and write...
maybe visit New York a certain amount, and in summer...
maybe spend some time some place romantic, like Bora-Bora.
I love Bora-Bora. Since I first went, I still think about it.
naturally, it's beautiful.
at night, the stars are so luminous you can practically read by them.
read by them, yes.
are you okay?
you got a...a little...
mist appeared in your eye then.
I thought you were going to cry, I swear.
no, I'm okay.
is something wrong?
what's wrong?
nothing's wrong. Something's exactly so right.
wait here. I'll be right back.
all my life......
I've been waiting for you.
my wonderful one.
I've begun living.
all my life...
all my love has been waiting for you.
my life is sublime...
now that I'm giving...
all my love...
I got you a present.
an African Daisy. My favourite.
what are you doing tonight?
I think Greg and I have plans.
how'd it go?
she was great. Whatever you told me was right on the money.
I feel guilty.
Why?
because I made her cry. She said she felt close to me.
so? You've established a beachhead. Now win the battle.
remember to blow between her shoulder blades. She goes crazy.
I won't do it. What's between her and her shrink is private.
are you going to give me a map of her erogenous zones?
are you seeing her tonight?
no. She's married.
listen, I don't know Bora- Bora from Walla-walla.
what do I know about Tintoretto?
I can't tell the difference between chiaroscuro and spaghetti sauce.
remember to blow between her shoulder blades.
I won't do it. Plus, I use a word processor, not a typewriter.
I hope you have something great to wear. There's a party tonight.
party?
I want to introduce you to someone.
dad...
this is Alberto.
nice to meet you.
hello. Who are all these people?
venetians. Friends, guests in town.
enjoying your stay in Venice?
it's the best. She'll tell you.
dad, you should be the first to know.
we're getting married.
wonderful. Tell me what century and i'll rent a tux.
this January.
pardon me?
this January.
you're joking.
I'm in love with Djuna.
we all love her, because she's adorable, but you are...
this is a jest.
january 15th, to be exact.
it's his mother's birthday.
a joke, am I right?
not at all.
excuse me a second.
come. I want to talk a minute.
what are you talking about? -Sorry.
tell me it's a joke, or there'll be carnage.
we're crazy about each other.
how can you be...? You met this guy 5 days ago.
so?
are you having a breakdown?
why, because I'm in love?
what do you mean, in love? What does he do?
he's a gondolier.
one of the guys with a striped shirt and a hat?
no hat.
what do you mean? - He doesn't wear a hat.
this is crazy! What are you gonna...
talk to me. You're talking about getting married?
that's insanity!
Why?
because you're going to school, to Columbia.
you're going to major in journalism or law, not rowing.
people have dropped out of Columbia before.
you're not going to run off with a guy you just met...
and who's a gondolier.
he's a poet.
a poet?
know what rhymes with gondolier? No Lira. Okay?
so forget it.
hello again. God, what a coincidence.
this is Joe Greg.
how are you?
the one with the heart attack? - That was me.
is Bernardo Bertolucci here?
I wouldn't recognise him. - I have to meet him.
mind if I go on?
it's a madhouse. - I'Il get you a drink.
incredible. - Is it?
have you seen this place?
it's unbelievable.
the whole thing is like an old palazzo.
and it's really beautiful. But it's frantic in there.
you look great.
don't say that.
Why?
I can't take a compliment.
you're terrific. Why not? I'm sorry.
no, it's my problem.
Why? Does it make you feel guilty?
maybe. I don't know. You've got all the answers.
I think it makes you feel guilty.
you must have fantasies of...
maybe someone coming along that...
you probably have dreams about boats or ships maybe, or even...
an elevator that...
you're on an elevator that goes higher and higher to the top floor.
and then it doesn't stop, it just goes...
through the roof and...
it sort of flies you over the ocean...
I think I'm going to faint.
I do.
are you okay?
I'm a little overwhelmed and...
I'm glad you're leaving tomorrow.
next morning, we left Venice.
dad flew to Paris, I went to New York.
I couldn't wait to tell Mom about marrying Alberto.
he was so beautiful, so sensitive.
my plan was to leave Columbia and go to Italy after the fall.
excuse me, that's mine.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. It's not mine.
we both shop at 'Hunting World.'
that's where I got it.
now I know it's mine.
I'll give you a hand.
bra, underwear.
Petrarch's sonnets.
what do you do?
depends on the guy.
no, just kidding.
I work for the Columbian drug cartel.
I gift-wrap the cocaine.
why am I so nervous? I study at Columbia.
is that right? My uncle teaches there.
math department. I'm Ken Grisley.
Djuna Berlin.
do I want to spend my life making pasta and riding in gondolas?
the truth is, those canals are awfully polluted.
alberto was cute, but Ken was...
hot.
cuddle up...
a little closer.
lovely mine.
cuddle up...
and be my little clinging vine.
like to feel your cheeks so rosy.
like to make you comfy-cosy.
because I love you from head to toesy.
lovely mine.
while i'd been away, an awful lot had happened.
mom bought Skylar a drop-dead wedding dress.
Holden's father and my father made friends.
they discovered a common interest - horse racing.
so they chipped in and bought a thoroughbred.
and Lane and Laura had a great summer at the beach.
but one hot weekend, with everyone else out of New York...
they found themselves in town.
we're probably the only ones in the city.
we usually go to Southampton, but we have tickets to a show.
I love the city when it's empty.
me too.
me too.
to make a long story short, they've all become close.
his name, if you can believe it, is Jeffrey Vandermost.
he's heir to the Vandermost millions.
they both love him and one of them'll have a broken heart.
fall was especially beautiful this year.
I like it better than spring.
and with October comes Mom's birthday.
this year we invited Holden's parents to celebrate.
but just before they arrived we had an unexpected visitor.
happy birthday!
these are from my biological father, all the way from Paris.
look, everybody! - Know what it is? Caviar!
could you put this on ice, Frieda?
are you expecting a Mr Ferry? - I am, yes.
you are?
he just got out of prison. He has no family...
but we can be his friends.
you're letting a criminal in our house?
he's paid his debt to society.
he has not paid... - Don't start.
society forgave him his debt, he didn't pay his debt to society.
how'd I get a kid on the other end of the political scale? I failed.
you didn't fail.
if I was you, i'd hide the silverware.
don't be rude. He's coming for just a drink.
you guys have everything.
mr Ferry, hi. I'm Bob Dandridge. This is my wife, Steffi.
Hello, Mr Ferry. Welcome to our home.
I'd like you to meet my daughter, Skylar.
this is Skylar, and her fiancé, Holden.
I'm the fiancé. - Can I get you something?
nobody gets behind me.
right, sure. Can I get you a drink?
vodka.
right, well, maybe on the...? Or just...?
straight up.
honey, Mr Perr...Ferry. Sorry, he's lived among vicious killers.
you said it. - No wonder he's skittish.
a lot of times a guy'll come up behind you and swish.
you must get your blade out quick. Stick him or you're dead.
God! Have you stuck a lot of inmates, Mr Ferry?
enough.
the doorbell.
excuse me, I need to get in front of you here.
would you like another?
Hi. Hello. How are you?
happy birthday, Steffi.
thank you, Lynn. Thanks for coming.
I have someone I want you to meet, Mr Ferry.
this is my good friend, Lynn.
and Arnold. This is my friend.
mr Ferry is just out of prison.
parole came through, but i'd have got out anyway.
Really? - What do you mean?
ice the guard. No pictures, sister.
what do you mean?
ice him, and get out through the air shaft.
get behind him with a box cutter, rip out his carotid artery.
may I have a glass of white wine?
we have some inside.
you must be careful though.
guy on Cell Block 4 tried it and didn't have the angles figured.
got his tit caught in the wringer.
take him on the terrace. - I need to sit down.
Yes, the terrace. Big, wide-open spaces.
you sure this guy is rehabilitated?
he was in prison, not a finishing school.
you know my sentiments, but very happy birthday.
a birthday song for Steffi.
looking at you while troubles are fleeing...
I'm admiring the view...
because it's you that I'm seeing.
and the sweet honeydew of well-being settles on me.
what is this light that shines when you enter...
Iike a star in the night?
and what's to prevent her from destroying my sight...
if you centre it all on me?
looking at you, I'm filled with the essence of the quintessence of joy.
looking at you, I hear poets telling of Lovely Helen of Troy.
darling, life seemed so grey...
I've wanted to end it.
till that marvellous day, you started to mend it.
and if you'll only stay...
then i'll spend it with you.
sweetie.
I'm gonna get some drinks. Want anything?
no thanks, but can you get Steffi's present from the car?
here.
enjoying the view?
I like any view after years in that stinking rat hole.
very vividly put. Sweetly honest.
you know what solitary's like?
no, I can't say I do.
I went to NYU. I didn't live in the dorm.
been a long time since I smelled perfume.
do I have too much on?
you smell like what I think heaven would smell like.
well, thank you. Very nice.
when you shook my hand, I thought my heart would stop.
Oh, that's sweet.
but remember, you've been deprived of female contact.
I used to lie in my cell and dream of someone like you.
I took a Criminology course at college. Very insightful.
you got very sensual lips.
it's a part of me I rarely think of.
can I smell your hair?
smell my hair? Okay.
you know what? it'll be gone soon. I'm thinking of cutting it.
Holden might like that.
if you were my girl...
it's a little chilly outside.
I'd make love to you in every room in the house.
on every bed.
on every rug.
on every tabletop.
we also have some lovely Early-American chandeliers.
let's go for a drive.
I don't think it's such a good idea.
I haven't seen the ocean or been to Harlem or Chinatown in years.
no, it's out of the question.
okay, but you can't blame me for trying.
no, I think we should go inside before...
before what?
before you break your parole.
if I took you in my arms and kissed you, would you dime on me?
dime?
turn me in.
let's not find out.
how was it?
very interesting.
I've never been kissed by a sociopath before.
I kissed you the best I could. The only practice I had in 10 years is with Vincent 'The Thumb' Adatto.
Vincent 'The Thumb' doesn't know what he's missing.
can I see you again?
you know I'm getting married.
I could show the world how to smile.
I could be glad all of the while.
I could change the grey skies to blue.
if i had you.
I could leave the old days behind...
leave all my pals, i'd never mind.
I could start my life all anew.
if i had you.
I could climb the snow-capped mountains, sail the mighty ocean wide.
I could cross the burning desert.
if i had you by my side.
I could be a king, uncrowned...
humble, poor, rich, renowned.
there is nothing I couldn't do.
if i had you.
he's en route to New York now, and he's wonderful.
it's been like...
a chance meeting after all these years with a true soul mate.
he senses my every need. Like he knows what I'm thinking.
it's your fantasy come true.
it is. I still can't believe it.
you know, it's not that he's tall or handsome, but he's magical.
and he feels me in a way no man ever has done before.
he's romantic and sexy and...
I had this dream...
that I was in bed with him...
and he was kissing my earlobes...
and then he started stroking my shoulder blades.
and I nearly had an orgasm.
I had a lot of neat stuff to tell Dad.
he'd really made a big score with Von.
but now i've got to stop for a minute...
because no matter how we humans like to think we control things...
that's not how it works.
suddenly, with no warning...
grandpa died.
it was in his sleep, peaceful, with no suffering...
but it made philosophers of us all.
when your number is up, your number is up.
that's why it's important that...
we cherish each moment of our lives.
and not smoke.
smoke?
pop smoked for 70 years, you know?
he never exercised. He ate cholesterol and fatty foods.
he died at a healthy, ripe old age.
I haven't had steak for so long. I love steak.
that's disgusting.
I'd kill for some marbleised meat.
now they say 6 cups of coffee a day prevents colon cancer.
last week it was bad for you.
what's it all about? I mean, what...?
what are we doing? We're rushing!
that's right.
where are we going?
into the void.
the void. - That's it.
I never believed in God. - Oh, come.
no, I didn't, even as a kid. I remember I used to think...
even if He exists, He's done such a terrible job...
it's a wonder people don't file a class action suit against Him.
you shouldn't say that.
we're not here just because of the new physics.
you must believe in something.
the dignity of man.
the flat tax, the right to bear arms and school prayer.
if nobody's out there, who're they praying to?
don't start arguing in front of Grandpa now.
I can't believe you.
one moment. He wasn't an atheist or a Republican, or a Democrat.
he must've been something.
he was a foot fetishist.
the only group I remember he belonged to.
that's true. - It drove your mother crazy.
pop, is that you?
I have one message for you.
you work and work for years and years...
always on the go.
you never take a minute off, too busy making dough
someday, you say, you'll have your fun when you're a millionaire.
imagine all the fun you'll have in your old rocking chair.
enjoy yourself...
it's later than you think.
enjoy yourself...
while you're still in the pink.
the years go by as quickly as a wink.
enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself...
it's later than you think.
another birthday's here and gone, you've turned another page.
suddenly you realise that you've reached middle age.
think of all the fun you've missed, makes you kind of sad...
it's better to have had your wish than to have wished you had.
enjoy yourself...
it's later than you think.
enjoy yourself...
while you're still in the pink.
the years go by as quickly as a wink.
enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself...
it's later than you think.
that was unbelievable.
just every thing you did and all the things you did.
absolutely perfect.
actually, it wasn't perfect.
at one point I stroked when I should have hick eyed...
but you know, I apologise.
I feel limp.
you know, I'd really love you to come to Paris with me.
I'm serious.
Paris?
and then Bora-Bora?
well, yes. Bora-Bora, but Paris first and then...
we'd work our way down to at least one of the Boras.
we can live in your garret.
technically, when I say garret, it is a garret, yet...
and drink wine and eat snails till the dawn comes up.
snails?
remember? You said you also loved waking up in the night drinking wine and eating snails
I said it was such a coincidence.
well, they're molluscs.
I love a good mollusc.
what? The wedding's off?
exactly. I gave back his ring.
Why?
there's someone else I can't get out of my mind.
but you're in love with Holden.
no. At least, I'm not sure.
and I can't cheat on him while I decide.
cheat? He's going to be your husband!
in November. I'll show you the receipts from the caterers.
calm your denial mechanism.
Holden is wonderful, but someone else came into my life.
I must see where it goes. It'd be unfair to Holden if not.
now we've bought the wedding dress...
tell us who this new Prince Charming is.
you don't know him. Well, you do, but not like I do.
I'm sick.
my oesophagus is in spasms.
go have a drink of water.
look what you're doing to your father.
who has come between you and Holden?
well, he's bright and charming.
rough on the outside, but that can change.
who is it? Will you tell us, or is this like a game show?
you remember Charles Ferry?
pardon me?
for a minute I thought she said Charles Ferry.
now my oesophagus is starting to move.
the escaped convict?
ex-convict. He has a college degree.
this is a psychotic episode.
you need shock treatment, or industrial-strength Prozac.
mom, you understand.
he's incredibly animalistic.
so we turn him over to the zoo.
and yet, he's a child.
okay, we'll make it the children's zoo.
he's a criminal!
I'm shocked. You've been singing his praises for months.
as a social symbol, not as a person to be with my child...
how are you going to go out with this man?
you can't get behind him. He won't let you.
you scratch his back, he'll knife you.
under all that veneer is a very soulful young attorney.
I was hoping you'd find a place for him in your firm.
sure, as treasurer. With Holden.
speaking as a woman, Holden can be very animal, too.
Yes, Mom, but it's of the gerbil family.
as your father, I forbid you to see this man Charles Ferry!
you will marry Holden!
as head of this house, I command it! I decree it!
thou shalt wed thy intended!
okay, let's get a drink.
you sound tiresomely Biblical.
tiresomely BiblicaI? Is this Noel Coward with hockey?
I won't let her waste her life. - She's a grown woman.
you!
you got him out of jail!
this is my fault now?
honey, what's wrong?
jeffrey Vandermost asked Lane out, not me.
my God! How will I face Arnold and Lynn Spence?
is that all you're thinking about?
we bought a racehorse together. He'll want to cut it in half!
we both liked him, and today he asked if we could talk alone so I got all excited.
then he asked me if I thought Lane would go out with him to a dance in Connecticut.
he has a mad crush on her.
these things happen.
feelings are feeling and sometimes...
I'm through with love.
I'll never fall again.
what are you saying? You're 14! You'll fall again.
look, guys, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be happy for me. I hope in time you understand.
I'm through with love. I'll never fall again.
what are you singing about? You're not in love with Holden!
I'm through with love.
I'll never fall again.
said "adieu" to love...
don't ever call again.
incidentally, while Skylar was breaking up with Holden I broke up with Ken, the one I met at the airport.
because I met this rap singer.
this guy is just so talented and sexy and...
he just says it all.
I'm through with love and through with all you motherfuckers.
feeling mad shitty? Burn down the city!
take it over for the brothers.
burn it up! Come on! Blow it up!
your eyes of blue...
your kisses too.
I never knew what they could do.
I can't believe that you're in love with me.
I love the country. The air smells so fresh.
Charles...
where did you get the money for everything, and the car?
you know. Loans.
it's a great idea to take a walk here. It's beautiful.
Yeah. What time is it?
four o'clock.
Oh, good.
just thought you'd want to walk around and see the fall leaves.
they are stunning.
amazing what you miss in the joint. No seasons. A grey nothing.
what are your plans? Not to work in the restaurant forever.
you're right. Work all day for a few lousy bucks? I got big plans.
like pursuing a law career?
what?
a lawyer?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
you hear something?
a bird?
here they come. Timing's perfect.
I'm running as fast as I can.
move it!
gotta get out of here!
I'm going!
back in action!
way to go, Ferry! - Got anything lined up?
who's she?
she's a friend.
why'd you shoot? He was emptying the register.
take it easy! I got nervous!
just let me out at the corner of Park and 93rd.
let me out! I want out of this car!
shut up!
I'll be quiet! Just let me out!
shut her up, or I shut her up.
get out!
by October, Von had gotten up the nerve to leave Greg.
she got a ticket on Air France and took the first plane to Paris.
dad had given up his flat on the Left Bank moving into a place he knew would be Von's Parisian fantasy.
he began guitar lessons and even exchanged his word processor for an old typewriter.
I'm so happy to see you.
God, look at your place!
this is out of a movie. Or a... This is like my dream.
this is my dream apartment. My dream view, right here.
back in New York, it was Halloween.
that's my favourite holiday.
all the kids in the building come trick-or- treating and...
they all just look so great.
what a little moonlight can do.
what a little moonlight can do to you!
Chinatown, my Chinatown, where the lights are low.
in some secluded rendevouz...
I'm Chiquita Banana and I've come to say bananas have to ripen in a certain way.
when they're flecked with brown and have a golden hue, bananas taste the best and are the best for you.
you can put them in a salad.
you can put them in a pie...yie-yie!
any way you want to eat them.
it's impossible to beat them!
but bananas like the climate of the very tropical equator.
so you should never put bananas in the refrigerator.
no, no, no, no!
that was great. Terrific.
would you like some candy?
what a banana!
I'm so happy to see you!
I wasn't sure. I was worried.
Holden, I'm so sorry.
it doesn't matter.
I behaved terribly. - It was me, too.
no, it was me. - I missed you.
me too.
I brought you some Cracker Jack.
he was so in love with my sister...
that it didn't matter that she'd given him a hard time.
and Mom and Dad were so glad to see them reunited.
he gave her back the ring, but he wanted to be romantic.
so he put it in the CrackerJacks and she swallowed it again.
the rest of fall was normal for us.
the only glitch was on Thanksgiving.
just after dinner...
Scott suddenly collapsed.
everybody panicked.
there's no cause for alarm.
there was a blockage in the artery, but it's been dissolved.
there's no problem?
no, he's fine. 100% .
our scan indicated that the condition began some time ago...
so if he's shown any kind of strange or weird behaviour...
it's because his brain wasn't getting enough oxygen.
but as soon as his brain started functioning properly, Scott resigned from the Conservative Republican Club and started espousing left-wing Democratic philosophy.
dad was overjoyed. Just as proud as can be.
remember I said New York was most beautiful in fall?
I meant the winter.
at least, when it snows. Because Under a blanket of snow, New York is truly gorgeous and surprisingly peaceful.
but when Christmas comes...
we're not the kind of family that sings carols...
and we don't have a goose or anything.
what we do is head for Paris, to spend Christmas at the Ritz.
put your finger here.
he has a fever...it's a cold.
should have put on dry clothes after you fell in the fountain.
I'm okay. Go without me. I'll be all right.
we don't want to go without you. You love the Marx brothers.
I just need some sleep. I'll be fine.
I'm so excited.
I'm meeting this guy named Guy... or this guy named Guy.
I brought you some tea.
it won't keep me awake, will it?
no, it's herbal. It's peppermint.
I'd say hello, but I'm sick and you always catch everything.
what happened? - What's wrong?
I'm not going tonight.
I knew it!
nobody's going? - Von left me.
what happened?
I have no idea, but she's on her way back to New York.
when she first came, everything was perfect.
she said it was like a dream had come true for her.
and then, suddenly...
this morning...
I want to go back home to Greg.
Really?
I don't know what's up with me.
since when?
I don't know.
Why?
I don't know how to explain it exactly.
just tell me. You know, just...
it's not that I don't think you're great.
I think you're great.
just for years i've been married to Greg.
and he can be difficult, and we've had our ups and downs...
certainly.
since when...?
look, I don't know. It's just...
I've always had this fantasy, that one day i'd meet the perfect man...
and he'd fulfil my dreams and I would have a perfect life.
and that fantasy...
I think, always sort of, was part of this dissatisfaction I had with Greg and my life.
and then you came along...
and you seemed to know every secret thing about me.
let me put it this way...
I have seen my dream come true...
and my fantasy no longer tortures me.
I can deal with it.
but that's so neurotic.
I know.
I'm crazy.
but suppose I said to you that none of this was really true, that this is all a surface? A surface i've been putting on.
that somehow I had access to your deepest feelings, needs and thoughts...
and that I've been playing this character just to win you over, to get you to like me, make you happy?
if that's what you told me, then I'd say you were crazy.
so that's exactly why I'm not going tonight.
I plan to go to Napoleon's tomb. To lie down next to him.
that'll be my Christmas Eve. - That's so sad!
the women you pick!
no, you're going out. Someone's got to take Mom.
you're too sick?
he looks terrible. - I'm fine if I don't move my eyes.
he has a 101 temperature. You're not going anywhere.
I'm not in a Groucho mood.
it's Christmas Eve, it's Paris. There's a ball that you helped organise.
I'll go for a couple hours. -Enjoy yourself.
I must stay here, but there's no reason you don't go.
it's later than you think.
remember our first Christmas in Paris, the month before we married?
I do, because that was when I knew that someday I would have to live there
I remember it like it was yesterday.
I don't want to panic you, but that was decades ago. Decades.
I know. I know it was decades ago.
remember that café we used to go to?
Café Terèse or whatever, with the cats. Remember?
now i'll tell you the truth.
I hated that cat.
maybe that's why you were scratching yourself all night.
was I scratching myself?
that's what you noticed? - I certainly did.
I hated that cat.
I couldn't stand it...
but now that café is round the corner from my home.
you're joking!
why would I joke about something like that?
you want to have a drink there?
why not? - Because we're drinking here.
why would I want to go?
we can take our moustaches off.
you're having a nostalgic...?
I'm having a thing. Sue me. I just thought it'd be fun.
we can't...
come on, we'll take our moustaches off, no problem.
that I'd like to do. - Me too.
never thought I'd hear you say, "Take my moustache off."
please.
wail go.
I feel good. I've had 3 glasses of champagne.
let's go see this place.
you want to sneak out?
I do. We snuck out before, remember?
remember that boring party we went to with the Wainwrights?
Yes, I remember, because we left through the toilet window.
a guy was singing, "Climb Every Mountain."
and you knocked over the punch bowl, if I remember correctly.
Yes, but you let out the shriek that got us caught.
remember how we made love? Do you remember?
you dropped your cigar. - I know.
I dropped the cigar and I...
you're so drunk.
I remember us making love.
remember the candles?
I remember the candles, the hotel, but not you.
unless you were the one under me.
now you're in character. - I don't know where I am.
I'm lost. - Come on. Let's go.
our coats are in the car. - Forget it.
it's a warm night. Come on. Pretend you're young.
I could do for you.
you're better off without her.
how do you know? You never met her.
I know you.
so what does that mean?
a good psychiatrist that listened to you would think every time I'm with a woman, you get jealous.
why are you laughing?
I just wish you'd pick someone who'd make you happy.
like who?
I made you happy.
I didn't say you didn't. - I made you very happy.
when we weren't at each other's throats.
does this ring a bell? This is why I took you here.
does this mean anything?
is this where we...?
this is it, yes. That's why I dragged you all over town.
my God!
you remember this? - We stayed up all night here.
I know. I held you in my arms till the light came up.
remember the song?
I do. - I still sing that song.
I learned it from you. That was the first time. Remember?
I'm through with love...
I'll never fall again.
said 'adieu' to love...
don't ever call again.
for I must have you...
or no one.
and so I'm through with love.
I've locked my heart.
I'll keep my feelings there.
I have stocked my hear with icy frigidaire.
and I mean to care for no one...
because I'm through with love.
why did you lead me to think you could care?
you didn't need me...
for you had your share of friends around you...
to hound you and swear...
with deep emotion...
devotion to you.
goodbye to spring and all it meant to me.
it can never bring the things that used to be.
for I must have you, or no one.
and so I'm through with love.
I wonder what would've happened if we'd stayed together.
that's something we'll never know.
we've managed to produce a fabulous daughter.
she is unbelievable.
she's got your looks, fortunately, and my magic personality.
she is wonderful.
and you've been very happy with Bob, so that's good.
he's wonderful.
you couldn't have done better. - No.
there have been a few times, you'll admit...
you did call me in an emergency and I had to come bail you out.
I know.
two major fights with Bob, and...
one disgusting lump that turned out to be benign...
though you were in a panic.
you were there for me.
and you for me.
and I appreciate it.
I think we've been better friends than husband and wife.
Yeah, we probably have.
but nobody made me laugh the way you did.
I love Bob with all my heart, it isn't that.
it's just that you could always push that button in me.
so why is that so important?
I don't know.
maybe we're crazy.
that girl that dumped you today, did she make you laugh?
I don't know.
I have to put that behind.
funny how life goes.
it's amazing. Amazing.
let's go. It's late.
it's definitely late.
Christmas Eve, and late.
let's go.
everyone says "I love you..."
the cop on the corner and the burglar too.
Christmas Eve in Paris.
what a year!
and that sort of brings us to the end of our story.
I told Skylar someone should write it up as a movie.
she said "Better be a musical, or no one will believe it."
by the way...
that night I met a terrific guy.
I mean, talk about sexy!
rule number one, know your products.
okay, whether it's a PC or a piece of paper; know how it works.
number two, know your customers.
learn everything you can about them.
listen to what they want and what they don't want.
rule number three, go the extra yard, okay?
if you don't have the answer; find it. it's that simple.
okay, let's go get those numbers up.
Hi, Nick. -Hey, Gary.
solid presentation there. -Thank you.
same one you gave last month, right?
how'd it go in Houston?
great. It went great.
how's the wife? -She's fine, thank you.
kids? -Kids?
I don't have kids.
Oh, right. Yeah. You don't have kids.
so listen, Nick.
the company has decided to make a change.
my numbers are as solid as they've ever been.
it's not about numbers anymore. -I've done everything the company has asked me to do.
I promised that my drinking would be under control, and it is.
not in Denver, apparently.
I made this office into a major player. My record reflects that.
you want to talk about your record, Nick?
1998, one month paid leave for alcohol counseling.
2000, another 30 days. 2001, accused of assault.
it was a softball game. The guy was blocking the plate.
2003, DUI.
2005, destruction of corporate car.
I've given 16 years of my life to this company.
and the company has rewarded you very well for your loyalty.
Mr. Goodson and the rest of the higher-ups wanted you to have this as a token of their appreciation.
you can keep the corporate car until the end of the month.
you can keep your health benefits, too, which is good.
your files are all corporate property, of course, but you can take three file boxes with you containing your personal items.
that should just about cover it.
and one of those cherry Slurpees, too.
this guy. I don't know. -I got it. I got it.
Hey, bro, I'll give you 10 bucks for that twack right there.
aren't you a little young to be drinking beers?
aren't you a little old to be drinking that Slurpee there, gray balls?
is that what they teach you in school, little shit?
what?
Hi. Are you in there?
if you are, can this happen another day?
Hi, it's Nick. I'm back.
I got your letter.
I really want to talk to you, okay?
I 'll just be getting some of the stuff off the lawn and getting it out of here if that's all right with you.
when you're ready, we can talk.
and you probably already heard,
I lost my job today. So...
okay, bye.
Oh, great.
Hey, Elliot. You're home early.
well, benefit of being the boss, I guess.
you know, having all that stuff on your lawn is gonna destroy your root system.
Yeah, I'm sorry about the mess.
I'll have it cleaned up by tomorrow. -Great.
listen, Nick. You know me, I try to keep out of people's way.
but if I'm honest, I saw this coming a mile away.
thanks for warning me.
no problem.
come on.
I like your bumper stickers.
right, I probably should have taken them off before I hit Texas, right?
here, let me help you. -Thank you.
I'm Nick. My wife Catherine and I live across the street.
Samantha.
you can just put that in there with the others.
okay.
so are you getting rid of your old stuff?
Yeah. Just a little spring cleaning.
you a photographer? -Yeah. Photography teacher.
Really? Where do you teach? -New York.
my husband... Well, we are relocating for work.
I lived in Newark for two years.
Westchester County.
well, welcome to Arizona.
thank you.
Hey, could I ask you a favor? Would you mind watching my stuff?
I just need to run to the store real quick. -Sure, yeah.
you know, no, I can't. I have to go meet my new doctor.
sure. Sure, I understand.
I'm sorry. It was nice to meet you.
Yeah, likewise. I'll see you around.
Yeah.
can I help you?
do you live around here?
my mom takes care of the lady down the street.
why aren't you at work?
I got the day off.
why'd you get the day off?
personal stuff.
with your wife?
why do you say that?
I saw her yesterday.
some dudes came over, too.
what dudes?
like a locksmith guy, an alarm guy, and, like, some movers.
she say anything?
she was screaming a lot.
and crying.
what's your name?
Kenny Loftus.
listen, Kenny, are you hungry?
if you stay here and watch my stuff, I'll go buy us some food, huh?
how's that sound?
here's 5 bucks. Okay?
you just can't leave. And don't touch anything.
where are you going? -I don't know, the liquor store.
what about the mini-mart? -Yeah, I can go to the mini-mart.
if I go to the mini-mart, will you stay here and watch my stuff?
I'd like some beef jerky and a Diet Coke.
okay.
Oh, shit.
what are you looking for? -My car keys.
you want to borrow my bike? -No, I'll find them.
sorry, dude, it didn't go through.
can you just swipe it again, please?
it didn't go through, Mr. Halsey.
Really? -Nope.
something's probably wrong with the machine.
can you just call it in? -I can't call it in, man.
how much is it? -$37. 50.
Hey, honey, it's Nick.
I just tried to buy some things with the credit cards and they didn't work.
look, I'm gonna need them to pay someone to move stuff off the lawn.
so if you can just call me back and we can possibly work this out,
I'd really appreciate it. Okay? Thank you. Bye.
Mr. Halsey, I checked the ATM it's working fine.
okay. Well, that doesn't make any sense. There's $45, 000 in that account.
the money's still there.
but apparently someone put a stop on that account.
but that's my account.
technically, it's a joint account and either you or your wife can put a stop on it.
who authorized that?
you did. Your signature is right here, sir.
next to your wife's.
your service has been temporarily suspended.
for an emergency, dial 9-1-1.
can I help you?
Yeah, this is my car.
this car belongs to Office Expo Inc.
Really? Well, that's my stuff right back there.
if it's inside the car, it belongs to the company now.
so you're gonna have to take it up with them.
Hey. Hey, look.
I don't want any problems, okay? I just want my stuff.
excuse me. Hey. Hey, hey!
this is my car.
those are my golf clubs. Those are my golf clubs.
why didn't you try to stop him?
he said it was his car.
did you get my jerky?
Yeah.
Where'd you get that?
that? -Yeah.
in the pile. -I told you not to touch anything.
Why?
cause some of it, like this, is worth a lot of money.
you know what this is?
a baseball?
a baseball signed by the entire '78 world champion Yankees.
Reggie Jackson?
thurman Munson?
Ron Guidry?
never mind.
we have a good team at my school.
yeah? Do you play?
I tried out last year, but I didn't make it.
well, there's always next year.
look, I've got work I've got to do here. So...
isn't your mom worried about you?
she'll be gone till Miss Cooper dies.
she just leaves you alone?
my sister comes around at night.
Kenny, I'm gonna try the direct approach with you, okay?
I need you to leave. Now.
I found your keys.
571 Xray. Yeah, we're out here. Code 4 for now.
afternoon. -Hi.
can I see some identification, please?
I left it in my car.
and where's your car?
it's gone. Even though, technically, it wasn't mine.
you want to tell me what you're doing out here?
Yeah, I would. I'm just organizing some of my things.
Why? Is there a problem?
Yeah, we've gotten some complaints about someone living on their lawn.
Really? Who complained?
I can't tell you that, sir.
well, this is my lawn. And this is my house.
and I'm pretty sure I can do whatever I want on my property.
how much have you had to drink?
in my opinion, not enough.
you know there's a law against having open containers in public, right?
there's a law that says I can't drink a fucking beer on my front lawn?
sir, you're gonna have to come with me.
I can't leave my stuff.
your things will be fine. Let's go. Turn around.
571 Xray. Yeah, why don't you...
Hey, stop talking into that thing.
stand by. -Just listen to me.
call Detective Frank Garcia, okay?
you want me to call Detective Garcia?
Yeah, call him. Call him. He'll fix all of this.
he wasn't violent, right?
no, man, he's just been drinking. He asked me to call you.
Thanks, man. I got it from here.
I came as soon as I could. I had a double homicide.
Thanks, Frank.
did you talk to her?
no, I think it's worth giving her a little time on this one.
she changed all the locks, you know?
garage code.
how do you change the garage code?
you haven't tried to break in yet. I'm impressed.
last time I broke in, you arrested me.
that's right.
you know that the moment that you even thought about having a drink you should have just called me.
well, let's see.
yesterday, what happened?
I got fired from my job and my wife left me.
so somehow calling you slipped my mind.
I got it. I got it.
you know, they say that the dining room is the least utilized room in the house.
I think it's the front lawn.
it's starting to look good, don't you think?
I don't care how it looks. You can't stay here. it's illegal.
I paid for this house, for her fish, for this lawn.
this is my house.
what's your point? -My point?
this is my corner. Okay? I'm not leaving my stuff.
all right. I'll call dispatch and make sure nobody comes by tonight.
but slow down on the beer, yeah? Get some rest.
we'll figure this out tomorrow.
she's coming up on a year.
I know, Nick. We still go to meetings.
Hey, Frank. -Yeah?
you're a good sponsor, you know?
actually, Nick, I'm not. I'll see you tomorrow morning.
it's a great rug.
Yeah, it was my mom's.
I got you some coffee and cigarettes.
I quit smoking.
Thanks.
you need any help moving today?
no, I'm good.
Really? Not planning to leave anytime soon?
well, since I don't have any money or car or phone,
I was just thinking about just staying here.
do you honestly think that this is how you're gonna get her back?
I'm just living day to day.
right. Right.
how many days you think it's gonna take to get your shit together?
you're gonna make me leave?
I'm not gonna tell you what to do because we both know that doesn't work.
but if it takes you sitting here and making an idiot out of yourself to get cleaned up, then so be it.
the city of Arcadia allows a property owner to hold a yard sale for no more than five consecutive days.
this buys you three days.
I don't want to sell my stuff.
sell your crap, don't sell your crap. I don't care.
but after this, you move on.
I got you some pens and some paper to make signs.
I got to make signs?
that was a joke. -Don't make an ass out of me, Nick.
no, it was a funny joke.
you have three days to get your shit together.
if not, I'm gonna have to haul your ass off to jail.
right. Mount Rushmore.
grand Canyon.
that's nice.
Hey, Kenny. -Hey.
I'm sorry about yesterday. -It's cool, man.
how's your penmanship?
pretty good.
I was thinking, seeing as you're not doing anything but riding your bike all day, you might want to come work for me.
what Kind of work?
make some signs. Maybe sell a couple of things.
what are you offering?
discussing salary and responsibility upfront, smart, very smart.
I'm thinking 4 bucks an hour, okay?
if I have to leave, you stay here, watch my stuff, act tough.
I'll feed you, give you bathroom and cigarette breaks as required by state law.
I don't smoke.
good. Great. So do we got a deal?
Arizona minimum wage is $7. 25.
okay, $7. 25 it is.
what? It's a good deal.
I want to learn to play baseball.
you want me to teach you how to play baseball?
Yeah, I don't know.
I see all your trophies and stuff on the lawn.
Yeah, I know. That's from high school.
why do you want to learn to play baseball?
my mom says I need the exercise.
okay, I could see that.
and my dad played.
okay.
now we got a deal?
deal. -Okay.
start making some signs. This is the sign area right here.
no, I haven't met the neighbors yet.
Yes, there's grass.
what about these clothes?
keep.
put them in that top, left-hand drawer.
what about these?
Yeah, those.
think I want to hold onto those.
they're actually pretty valuable. You'd be surprised.
you can put 'em in that same drawer.
I'll know that they're there in case I want to look at 'em.
so when are you coming?
well...
okay. Okay, Well, when will you know?
can I help you? -How much?
I'm sorry, the shoes are not for sale. They shouldn't be over there, actually.
how much for the chair?
you know, it's not for sale, either.
how much for this?
you want to buy that? -How much is it?
50 CENTS.
I'll give you 25 cents.
Yeah, I just can't do that.
hold on, hold on. Let's keep it at 50 and let's see.
I'll throw in some floss.
great. Have a good one.
rule number eight, always give 'em a little something extra.
there's your take.
can we work on baseball now? -I'm beat.
why don't you go hang some more signs or something and we'll call it a day?
I don't know why I'm hanging signs if you're not gonna sell anything.
I sold some mouthwash.
okay.
thank you. -Sure.
where do you want this? -I guess, just...
you can just leave it over there somewhere.
so is this your first time for a yard sale?
Yeah. Yeah, it is, actually.
watch out for the pros on Saturday.
they'll try to beat you up on price.
do you go to a lot of them?
Yeah, they're good for finding old cameras.
once you get rid of all that stuff, you're gonna feel great.
Yeah, I think so. -Yeah.
Hey. I was gonna order Chinese food.
it's not New York, but...
you know, I have a lot of stuff to do before my husband gets here.
right. No, I understand.
but thank you for the offer. -Sure.
could I use your phone?
to order?
Hey.
Hey. -Hi.
I saw you got your food and I thought you could use something to eat with.
here. -Well, thank you.
you're welcome.
can I... Do you want... Can I make you a plate?
Yeah, sure. -Why not?
right. Thank you. -Great.
no.
do you mind if I look through? -Go ahead.
God, these are incredible.
Yeah.
wish I still had mine.
can't believe you still listen to vinyl.
I don't. They were my father's.
he was a DJ. -Yeah?
the Late Night Mix with Glen Halsey on KZOV.
Wow. -Please, sit here if you want.
no, no, I'll use this. This is fine, don't worry.
there you go.
Yeah, he played jazz, country, rock, Tejano, all kinds of crazy stuff.
he sounds like an interesting guy.
Yeah, no. He was more of a drunk who occasionally did interesting things.
so you're a teacher, huh?
I guess I should say I'm a photographer, but teaching takes up most of my time.
have you ever had any shows of your work?
Yeah, I've sold some pieces.
not enough to get rich, but...
actually, I sold one to my husband. That's how we met.
okay.
so what do you do for work? -Well, as of yesterday, I was regional vice president at a very large corporation.
sorry. -Don't be.
look, I made good money. I bought this house.
we've been to Europe, the Caribbean, Japan twice.
Wow. -Yeah. So...
does he have a name yet?
Yeah.
Yeah, my husband wants to call him Jack.
that's his name, my husband.
I think it's a little ridiculous naming a child after yourself.
do you have kids? -No.
no, we don't.
we have fish.
the gold one here...
Asagi. -Asagi.
Yeah.
she had the breeders shipped over in those special containers from Japan.
a grand each.
this used to be our swimming pool.
but it's not anymore. You know?
so what's the music for?
she'd read that it improves breeding.
you know, it's okay. You can...
you can ask me.
ask you what?
about all that out front.
I mean, you just moved here and you have to look at it.
look, I'm sure whatever it is, you can work it out.
I was sober for six months.
I had a couple of slipups, you know, here and there.
nothing major. But I was trying, you know?
and, well, I was on a business trip and we completed this very big deal.
so I took everyone out to celebrate.
there was this new girl, Sharon, from the Denver office.
so she got champagne for everyone.
I figured, "I'll have a glass, right?" You know?
just to toast.
we must have gone through six or seven bottles.
and then it was just us, in her room, you know, keeping the party going.
so what happened?
in the morning, she was gone.
and then there were lawyers, and investigations and interviews.
and, you know...
did you do it?
whatever they said you did?
I don't know. I don't know.
I should go.
here, let me take your plate.
let me walk you home.
it's fine. I can walk across the street.
wait. Wait. Hold on.
don't forget this. Fortune cookie.
Thanks.
good night.
Hey.
Hey.
I like it. I like it.
are you listening to me? Pour some wine.
come on, pour it. -Come on, bring it.
that's it. -Put it in! Put it in!
put it in! -Bark for me.
come on, bark.
Yeah. Yeah, bark. Bark for me.
Oh, I like that. You're a dog, aren't you?
you're a great big dog. Nice puppy.
take it out! Take it out! Take it out! I want some more wine.
keep barking, baby. Keep barking.
you're a nice puppy.
Yes, Nick?
I'm interested in that rotisserie over here.
the rotisserie? -Yeah, the rotisserie.
one second.
Nick.
Hey, that guy wants to buy the rotisserie 5 bucks.
what am I gonna cook with?
you got the Foreman.
okay, tell him I'll sell it, but that I'll only take $10, all right?
he's not gonna do it.
well, tell him why he should buy it, right? Focus on the benefits.
go ahead. If you have to take $7, that's okay.
he won't accept the $5.
but I'll let you know the rotisserie is brand new.
he's only used it twice. You can cook anything with it.
he wants $10, but I'll take $7.
$7 is good. -Thank you.
good sale.
you got the gift.
Kenny, take a seat.
look, you've been busting ass. I just want you to know I appreciate it.
all right? You know what? This company needs a shake-up.
we need a little less "me" and a little more "we.
like this, not like this.
don't do that. Do that.
are you sure you're left-handed?
Yeah, I'm sure.
why don't you want to play football? -My mom won't let me.
that's a shame, Kenny, 'cause you're a born left tackle.
big, fast, smart.
how about soccer?
black people don't play soccer.
whole continents of black people play soccer.
Pelé. You heard of him?
Yeah, try not to be afraid of the ball.
you know what? Why don't you practice a little bit on your own?
how do I do that? -Just throw it up in the air and catch it.
Hey. -Hey.
I found this. Used to be my mom's.
Wow. -I don't Know if it still works.
let me see.
Oh, God, it's beautiful.
is there film in it? -I don't know.
smile.
Yup. -Yeah.
Wow. -Keep it.
no, I couldn't take it. That's sweet, but... -No, please.
Really? -Yeah. Yeah, I want you to have it.
can I pay you for it? -No. No. No. No, my gift to you.
unless you want to play first base.
but I figured probably not.
thank you.
okay, that's good.
see? Wasn't that helpful? -I guess.
let's do some grounders.
what's a grounder? -I'll show you. Throw it to me.
ready? Hands on your knees.
when the ball comes, glove on the ground, watch it into your glove. All right?
there you go.
how's Miss Cooper doing?
my mom says she's gonna die soon.
but I guess she's not suffering.
I'm glad she's not suffering.
she's definitely got a nice pool.
Hey, what does it mean when it says, "Make it easy to buy"?
well, it can mean a number of things, getting rid of extra paperwork, displaying things in a way that are appealing to people, explaining how products work.
you actually interested in that stuff? -Yeah.
if you read all that, you'll know more than me.
what? -Nothing.
no, go ahead.
are we friends?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.
remember when I told you I tried out for the baseball team?
Yeah.
I lied. I don't play sports.
why not?
they make you change in the locker room. -So?
the other kids make jokes.
what kind of jokes?
they say, "You're so fat you got shocks on your toilet seat.
you're so fat if your arm broke, gravy would be coming out.
that's mean.
you heard this one?
your mama's so fat she heard it was chilly out, she ran inside and got a bowl.
your mama's so fat she has to shower at a car wash.
your mama's so fat she has 101% body fat.
you mama's so fat you have to roll her in flour then dive for the wet spot.
do you know what that means?
no.
Yeah, maybe don't tell that one.
Kenny, look, you can't worry about what other people think about you.
you just got to fight back.
is that what you're doing?
what? -Are you fighting back?
Yeah, I'm fighting.
who are you fighting?
Hi, Lynette. It's Nick.
Yeah, sure, I'll hold.
Hey, Gary.
I know. I know it was stupid. Yeah.
Yeah, you're right. You're right, I am an asshole.
Yeah, Gary, I know. I know it was fucking stupid to leave the knife.
Yeah. Hey, Gary. Gary.
listen, why don't I come in?
why don't I come in and we'll sit down and we'll talk about this?
what? Gary?
Gary!
Hey, Kenny.
let's put this in the for sale pile.
what about these books?
is that you?
Yeah.
you look happy.
I was, I guess.
what happened?
what do you mean, what happened?
life happened.
work happened. Marriage happened.
Hi, this is Nicholas Halsey.
I went to high school with your daughter Delilah.
thank you, ma'am. Yes. You, too.
listen, I'm on the high school reunion committee.
we're trying to get in touch with Delilah.
just wondering if you'd have an address or a phone number where I could send her some information.
just a minute. Can I help you?
delilah? -Yeah.
it's Nick.
Nick Halsey.
Nicholas. Wow.
God, hey. -Hi.
what are you doing here?
I was just in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by.
how'd you find me?
I called your old number and your mom gave me your address.
okay. -Yeah.
what a nice surprise. -Yeah.
I'm just getting some dinner ready for my kids.
of course. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I just wanted to stop by and say hello.
you know what? I'm gonna give the kids dinner outside.
and if you just wait, I'm gonna bring the food out and you and I are gonna catch up, okay?
great. -Sound good?
Yeah. -Okay. it's gonna be great.
all right. Hey, you guys. Dinner outside.
no, I actually went out to LA to study acting.
Yeah, I got a couple of decent jobs. I got to do a TV commercial with Brad Pitt.
Really? -It was fun.
Yeah. -It was for Japan, so nobody here got to see it of course.
it was cool. We were in the desert at an old gas station.
and there were tumbleweeds going by and we're drinking beers, which, of course, is why you could never see it in the US.
sure. -And these Japanese tourists pull up and they have one of those star maps and they're asking directions.
I mean, this sounds dumb but I got to say, "Y'all look lost.
and then Brad kind of smiles at them, you know.
and he takes the star map and he points to his own house.
I see.
so, it was cool.
he was a real sweetheart.
what an experience.
then I had Lizzy and my husband left.
so we came back here.
and it's a good place for kids to grow up. You know, it's safe.
so what about you?
are you married, or... -Yes. Yes, I am.
and you have kids? -No. We're...
we're waiting for the right time, you know.
there isn't one, trust me.
Yeah, how do you handle all this?
all What?
the responsibility.
you know, raising them by yourself, supporting them.
I don't really have a choice, right?
my dad always said to me, "Good without the bad ain't no good at all.
so we just make it work, right, missy?
you're a natural.
Hi.
wow, it was great to see you. -Yeah. You, too.
is there something else you wanted to say to me?
I'm sorry.
but when we were in high school, you wrote this.
Oh, my gosh. Look at us.
you're a diamond in the rough.
that was 20 years ago.
I know.
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
it's stupid.
Hey. No, I mean, we weren't really friends.
exactly. It's stupid. I'm so sorry.
it was really great to see you.
Hey, you remember those crazy parties at Brian Sever's house?
Yeah. Well, I showed up with bright pink hair once 'cause I was going through a phase.
and the guys were super drunk, especially Brian.
and he decided he was gonna try to dunk my hair in the pool to get the pink out.
and everybody just thought that was super funny.
I was really embarrassed and scared.
and you came over and tried to stop him.
and he wouldn't, so you punched him and knocked him into the pool.
then you gave me a ride home while your girlfriend hung out at the party.
don't you remember that?
no.
well, I do.
you have a good heart, Nicholas. That doesn't change.
so when you get yourself together, you should call me and we'll go have some coffee.
sure.
Nicholas, are you gonna be all right?
Yeah. Yeah.
what's up, man? -Hey.
how you doing? -Good.
that's all? -That's it.
$6. 50, man. -Yeah, I don't have $6. 50.
can I just get this?
I can't do credit on this, man. You know that.
Really? -Yeah.
on a six-pack? -You're here all the time.
I know, I've been coming here all the time. So can you just spot me?
not at all, man. I'll lose my job. I can't do that.
can you just give me one beer? -No, not even one -'cause it's a whole case right here. -You being serious right now?
I'm being serious right now. -Really? For real?
can't you just tell?
I should fucking call the cops on your ass for that.
you better leave. Yeah, run.
Hey, I don't mean to bother you, but can I get a beer from you?
can I get one of your beers?
I just need a drink.
these are Valium.
they'll help.
you feeling any better?
Thanks.
you know, you need some help.
I've tried help.
Yeah, well, maybe it wasn't the right kind.
you know, there's new medications, new therapies.
I don't need medication.
well, you can't live like this.
why not?
cause it's not normal.
normal?
what's normal?
that guy Stanley what's-his-name, down in the blue house, his wife blew her brains out last month 'cause her daughter didn't make cheerleading.
Kenny practically lives by himself, you know?
Elliot and Kitty, I can't even tell you what they do.
I'm no different than any of you. I just don't hide in my house, okay?
what does that mean? -What?
any of you.
nothing. Nothing. I'm just saying...
no, you said "any of you.
never mind.
no, go on. I'm a big girl. Say it.
I don't want to do this right now.
say it.
what's his name?
who? -Your husband. John? Jeff?
Jack. -Jack.
he started out in a regional office, right?
Yeah.
he impressed some people who moved him up to the big leagues.
how many years? -Two.
two years? Yeah.
now he's back at the regionals.
you're sacrificing your promising career as a photographer for him.
so?
I figured you out in five minutes.
he drinks.
they transferred him out here 'cause he fucked something up.
you probably thought it was a good idea to come out here.
might even save your marriage.
for better or for worse, right?
right.
I just want to know one thing.
what kind of man lets his wife, his pregnant wife, move alone across the country?
and what kind of woman stays with a man like that?
what kind of woman? What, so it's my fault?
you must be really good at your job, you know, just reading people so easily, figuring out what bullshit to sell 'em.
Hey. -God, what?
you need to put up some curtains.
Why? So I don't have some drunk staring at me all day?
no, so you don't have to look at your future.
jeez.
fuck you! Fuck you!
light up your life. Stop living in the dark.
Hey. -Hey.
how long have you been here? -A couple of hours.
where did the tables come from?
the tables? -Yeah.
your neighbor Elliot.
you got price tags on everything.
how'd you do that?
market research. I'm making it easy for the customer.
nice work, Kenny. -Thanks.
really nice work.
Hey, how's it going? -Hey. Good. Good.
just thought I'd stop by a little, check up on you.
Thanks.
so you're letting some of this stuff go, huh?
Yeah. I'm gonna sell it, you know, everything I can.
I'm proud of you, bud. -Thanks.
Yeah, Catherine, we can...
I can work this out.
this is a good first step. It is.
why don't you stop by the station when you're done?
okay. Yeah, I'll be there.
thanks for stopping by. -No problem.
excuse me. How much for the chair?
the chair? -Yeah.
$2 and I'll throw in the macramé. -All right.
thank you.
that actually works.
same taste in tapes, man.
that's right, throw it on the grill there.
you ever fish the lower Salt?
no.
at sunset with the water like glass, it's religious.
sounds nice.
I'm sorry, I've never fished the lower Salt. I've never even gone fishing before.
I've never been fishing in all my life.
that looks really good on him. -Yeah, isn't it cute?
really cute. Old school.
I'm not sure. -Your girlfriend is.
all I know is I bought this for $125.
I'm not gonna do $125.
I'm not asking you to. -Okay.
I'm asking $25. -I'll do $15.
what about $22? -$20. - 20
$21 -Okay.
how much is this? -$10.
Hey, that should be $15. I got engaged in that suit.
I saw you checking out the blender.
I could do both for $25.
all right, deal.
rule number one, always have power so people can test appliances.
that's a good rule.
Hey, just wanted you to know everything's going pretty good.
and I'm selling it, all my stuff.
all my crap. And it feels pretty good.
I'm getting rid of everything, Catherine.
anyway, call me when you're ready.
on Kitty's phone, I guess.
I miss you. Bye.
made in China, even though it's supposed to be Japanese, so...
you know What? I'll give it to you for $25.
and I'll throw in this wolf and polar bear.
okay, let's show 'em, ladies.
hustlers. You're all hustlers. You hustled me.
all right, another hand like that and I'll be buying the table from you.
who's deal? Sherry, your deal?
all right. -Right here. Here we go.
Yeah, you don't have to shuffle.
so, yeah, you can cook anything on it.
you can cook hot dogs. You can cook bacon.
you can cook burritos.
who's in first? -I'm in for $10.
$10'? -I'm in for $15.
$15'? -I'm in for $15 as well.
okay, that's already too rich for my blood.
I don't have that kind of money. -You want to borrow a chip?
you know what? I'm all in, plus the cat ashtray.
okay?
yours sticks. -Yeah.
that's good luck. -The high-level players can do this.
how we looking? -Take a look.
okay, good.
I can't hardly even find this stuff anymore.
how much for these? -I'm sorry. They're not for sale.
come on, man. What do you want for 'em?
no, no, I really can't. -Seriously?
I think you'll be happy with either.
what do you think, green or blue? -Go with blue.
all right, thank you very much.
how's that mouthwash treating you?
how much for the chair?
can I ask why you want it?
I need a new chair.
what happened to the old one?
I got a new color TV over at a sale in Gilbert. I need a new chair.
you know what? Why don't you take it?
I want you to have it.
Yeah.
Samantha?
please, I know you're in there.
nice house.
I just wanted to apologize for last night.
no, look, really, it's fine. I shouldn't have pushed.
I don't know you. I don't know your husband.
Yeah, well, I called him last night.
I told him I was going to leave him.
he said he was coming tomorrow.
so you're right.
maybe you don't know people so well after all.
are you gonna go back to New York?
I don't know.
well,
I don't think it's right to make a decision like that without having authentic Mexican food.
have you had an authentic Mexican meal in Arizona?
no.
well, Kenny and I, we're gonna go celebrate. He's buying.
so...
sounds nice.
great. Good.
cause we need a ride anyway.
of course.
lively. -He likes it.
maybe. Or really doesn't like it.
are you ready for him? -Yes.
no.
I can't figure out what color to paint the baby's room.
I don't know why, but somehow it seems really important.
it is important. Every color has a specific effect on people.
what are you thinking? Come on, it's what I do for a living.
you pick colors for a living?
no, I pick colors to make people buy things.
I like yellow. -That makes people anxious.
Yeah. -That's not good.
how about blue?
blue is soothing. Color of communication. -That's good.
Yeah. Green is good, also.
well, then I guess it's blue.
or green.
here's to blue or green.
to blue or green.
Nick.
Wow.
what brings you downtown?
dinner with friends. You?
drinks with the boys from the office.
how's everything at work?
things are good. They're good. Nothing new, really.
we filled your position.
Yeah, some kid straight out of business school.
he's good. He's not as good as you, but he's young and he's cheap.
right.
pretty good ballplayer, too, from what I understand.
think he even played in the Minors.
they got rid of that Sharon girl.
Really?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, it turns out she threatened to sue two other guys at her last job at Kittredge.
total bullshit.
wow, kind of makes you think, doesn't it?
if you hadn't stabbed my Mustang, probably could've gotten your job back.
sued for wrongful termination, even.
Yeah. Well, I'll see you around, man.
it's the kind of thing you kind of feel like you want to touch, but you're not really sure.
think you forgot that.
Hey, can you drop me off somewhere?
Yeah, sure. -Okay, thanks.
where are you going?
that's none of your business where I'm going.
I'm a grown man.
I'll buzz you in.
glad you had the time. -Yeah, I know.
just ate at that place over on 60th. -Yeah?
and the sale?
great. -Good. So listen, -I've got to check up on a statement. -Okay.
you good? Want anything to drink? -No, I'm good. Yeah.
I'm glad you're here. -Good to be here. Thanks.
Frank? Frank, it's Catherine.
I'm back at your place.
call me back if you can hear me.
Frank? Frank, are you...
can I stay at your house tonight?
why don't I just get you a hotel room?
no, I think it would be better if I stayed with you.
well, you know you can't do that.
she didn't have anywhere to go.
she could have stayed with her sister.
she wanted a drink, so she came to me, bud.
she came to me. I'm sorry.
we always joked about this, you know?
yeah? What? -Yeah, the 13th step.
come on, man. -First you teach them the 12 steps.
then you get them into bed for the 13th.
it wasn't like that, bud.
she came to me for help.
look, I'm sorry. I... -Shut up, Frank!
look, let's go get some coffee and talk.
she deserves better, you piece of shit. She deserves better.
okay. Okay. No. No. No.
I got it. -You all right? Stay there.
do you know the success rate for a marriage when one person gets sober and the other one doesn't'?
is it higher than the suicide rate for cops?
it's almost zero.
I know this because I go to the meetings. I do the work.
you know, she came to me about six months ago.
I told her to leave you.
but she wanted to give you another chance, said she still loved you.
but then you go out and you get drunk and you have sex with another woman.
I mean, it would be perfect if it wasn't so damn sad.
can I ask you a question?
how long since you guys slept together?
how long since you asked her if she was happy?
you know what? Stop the car.
let me just take you home. -No, just pull over.
Catherine wants a divorce.
and she wants the house, too.
I was gonna tell you tonight.
here are the papers.
the keys to the house are inside. There's some spending money in there.
she wants to keep it amicable.
so just sign the papers and you'll get your share.
I want you to know that Cate and I, we haven't given up on you.
if you want a new sponsor, I could recommend somebody.
Frank...
tell my wife I'm sorry.
Hey. -Hey.
so how are you doing?
fine.
here.
what's this? -The money we made.
I plugged the record player in in case you wanted to listen to music.
nice job, Kenny.
there's your take.
this is too much. -Take it.
I was skimming your profits for beer money.

Oosterkerke, 31 January 1953
Julia, I don't have anything to wear.
I'm going like this.
no. - I am.
Julia, You can't! Wear this.
you really don't have anything I can wear?
well. Is that better? - It is.
may I wear this?
can I borrow this? - Very well.
little Ernest...
...did it wake you?
you want Mum?
here's Mum.
I feel like dancing.
you won't forget to feed her at eight? - Make sure you're home on time.
Julia, really! Henny's coming at 8: 30.
if you're not back, I'll leave. - It's no weather for a party.
father wants you to stay home.
we won't blow away. We're not candyfloss.
it's awful out.
it's not just that...
Emma, 8: 30 remember?
can't we give her a lift? - No.

brass Band - 25th Anniversary
very unseemly!
it's party time!
go on, say it!
you're a whore!
that's no name for a dog: "Gouda"? - Yes, Gouda. Just watch!
just watch this.
sausage...
cheese.
you see? Gouda!
sorry. - What's the use of that?
I'll take it to the cleaner's for you. - Others always pay for your foolishness.
you mean that dress that no longer fits you?
at least I don't disgrace my family. - You're too busy disgracing others.
Emma, you were going to look after Ernest!
mum's babysitting. - You know I don't want her to.
she said it was okay. - You don't understand!
I say! Julia.
Julia!
Yes, drop it.
it's out of hand!
is the phone working? - What?
your phone!
den Helder Naval Base
lieutenant Hendrickx.
what?
telephone... It's your brother.
hey kid... - Hi. I'm back...
that's great... Where are you now?
in the harbour... - The harbour?
things are getting out of hand... - Out of hand?
the storm. Bert thinks we can't cope.
Koos? Been drinking? That dike's lasted 100 years...
I've never seen it like this. I'm going to mother...
...but I wanted to tell you. In case it really goes wrong...
Julia.
Julia...
wake up, wake up!
come on.
behind you!
it's out of hand.
the water...
Ernest, it's all right!
it's stopped... it's stopped.
where is father?
he was close to the dike...
Julia, watch out!
Julia!!
give me your hand.
we're engaged, aren't we?
more or less?
I still feel sick.
five weeks later? - Yes.
you haven't heard anything?
nowhere in Zeeland? No calls for help?
from the North Sea... for the coastguard.
wait.
the private phone is in the hall.
Aldo, see you next week.
Theo!
are you flying back? - If I can take off.
can you make a detour? - Why?
come on. - What's up?
I'm worried about my brother. - Why?
Zeeland has gone...
we have to go back. - Please go south.
no one knows this...
we have to go back. - Believe me.
we're near my mother's house. Please...
here...
here...!
there! There is it.
our house is still there!
that's her! My mother!
go down... - What are you doing?
go down, closer!
hey...
hold on!
what are you doing? - We have to warn people.
shut the door.
maybe it's better to stay home, Julia.
but it's Christmas!
there's enough disgrace on this family.
wait! There!
I can see someone!
close the door!
wait a second.
she won't make it. - Wait, I have to descend.
No!
Julia.
press hard...
come on. Good. You can do it.
...uncircumcised in heart and ears...
...ye do always resist...
...the Holy Ghost...
...as your fathers did. - It's a boy...
I don't think they'll come, Julia.
WOENSDRECHT AlRBASE
madam...
you'd be better off in bed.
come on, I'll take you back.
doctor...
...she won't listen.
no... No... - Calm...
come on. Come.
unfortunately we need all the pilots we have.
report to Captain Mulder right now and if you fail to obey an order...
...I'll haul you in front of a court marshal myself.
do I make myself clear, Lt Helmers? - Yes, sir.
I can't decide your fate, Lt Hendrickx. Alas.
I won't bother to say what I think of your insubordination.
I talked to your superior, who mentions mitigating circumstances.
...a state of emergency declared.
a car is waiting for you. Report to your base for further orders.
Yes, sir.
wait!
I'm sorry it's necessary... - Wait.
Julia! - She's in shock...
can they let you free?
give me a few minutes. I know her.
it's okay.
stop or you'll be sedated for a week.
Ernest... my baby...
there's little chance of reaching your house.
you have something against me?
I didn't do anything to you? - You could have saved him.
I didn't see it. I had no idea where you were going.
you could have thought. - I saw you drowning...
...and you'd die if I didn't get you to a doctor.
could you give me a hand?
I can't move it.
grab it...
one, two, yes...
keep it straight.
sorry, I have to get on.
you can't.
there's nothing left.
stop!
stop! Please! Julia.
have you gone mad!? - I have to go back!!
you can't! There's nothing left! - I have to!
Julia...
mind the step.
look!
are you okay?
come and sit down.
Krelis, I knew you'd make it.
I nearly didn't. - Your wife and daughters?
I don't know...
I think this old man needs a tot?
I don't have any money. - I didn't ask that.
I'd like one too.
two... - Two gins.
the dry tables and chairs can be taken upstairs, okay?
let's get as much as possible upstairs.
sir...
you can't neglect that.
it needs to be cleaned.
there's still some milk...
...but we have to save it for the children.
and your husband isn't here?
he...
there was a car crash...
...three weeks ago.
he died...
I'm sorry.
he's all I have left...
Hey, neighbour.
did you pass my farm?
did you see...?
there's only water, Krelis...
you did your best.
what was that?
was that an apology? - Watch out!
there!
Hey, get out of my boat!
I have to go to Oosterkerke.
you're crazy. There's nothing left.
are you deaf? - It's an emergency.
it's all emergencies today.
it's up to you. I won't bring you back.
if we don't keep calm... Reverend... Ladies...
please everyone, if you don't... Please don't push. We have so little.
one slice of bread...
sir, let the little boy go first.
are you charging restaurant prices, Guus?
my family has to eat. - I'll make sure you get paid.
you shouldn't worry about profits though.
the hotel isn't charity... - We didn't do that in the war?
I have a right to...
Reverend, will you lead us in prayer?
the hair of my flesh stood up...
...and I feared your judgement.
come on. Keep rowing to the dike.
keep rowing.
have you seen my brother?
Koos Hendricks? - No.
come on. We have to go back.
I thought he'd be safe...
...warm and dry...
it's dry!
it's dry!
so it didn't tip over.
he can't climb out, so...
maybe someone came and rescued him.
it's possible. - They must have.
otherwise he'd still be here. - You don't know what happened to it.
the lid was shut. The lid was shut.
come on.
he must have been crying.
someone heard him.
if you're right, your baby is safe.
and we can leave here. Okay?
I know...
I know where he is.
you won't drag it around. If it's not your child...
...you'll take it to a dry spot as soon as possible.
where there's food... and mothers.
where do you want to go? - To the hotel.
we're going to the pumping station! - That's okay!
it's close by there.
we're taking them to the pumping station.
they were hand-in-hand.
could you help?
we're being flooded...
sorry! I didn't mean it like that.
it's better to keep busy, don't you agree?
no nappies.
but maybe you can use something here.
you have grandchildren?
I hope his grandpa, my father, is safe.
he lives in South Beveland.
don't you want to see your grandson?
I don't have a grandson.
there you are. Can you give me a hand?
I can't... - You can.
no Stien, I won't. - I'll help you.
we have to take things to the attic.
Yes, yes. Come on.
you have to get warm, Julia. - lndeed. Indeed.
I realise you think God punished you more than others...
...but remember, he tests those dear to him...
...most severely.
we can't give up hope.
we'll always be here for you. In times like these, all Christians...
we're one big family.
we can only hope and pray that God will mercifully spare us.
has a little baby being brought here?
your mother...
and Emma? - No...
I'm still looking for Ernest...
...your grandson...
...if you're interested.
has anyone seen my baby?
has a baby been brought in?
has anyone seen my baby?
I already asked.
you have to rest... it's already dark.
there's nothing else you can do.
is there some way she can sleep? - Stien?
I suppose so. But I don't know where.
there isn't a spot in the hotel? - Maybe in the attic, up those stairs.
Ouch! - I'm sorry.
here, come and sit down.
go away. This spot is mine.
sorry.
what great solidarity!
some people think I'm the devil's daughter.
I expect I'll be blamed for this disaster.
God's punishment...
I look for some food and dry clothes...
your attention please.
I have two lists here.
fill your name in on one. The other list is the missing.
I'll hang them up here.
there's no contact with the outside world.
from now on food is rationed. That was it.
aren't you the brother of Koos Hendrickx?
that's right. Aldo.
is Julia all right?
I wanted to thank you... for helping her.
I'm terribly sorry about your family.
it's God's will.
God's will...
I'm sorry, women and children first.
everyone's already eaten? - No.
not yet. Food is now rationed.
you'll have to wait.
okay. Just for Julia then. - You'll have to wait.
you saw her. She has to eat!
I'm sorry.
serve it!
Communist!
you don't want any?
I already had some.
thank you.
you said that already.
for everything.
I shouldn't have saved you, should l?
that's true.
you must be tired.
if Ernest was found by someone without a boat...
...then he can't get here.
tomorrow we'll get a boat and find him.
it's a reminder...
...that men can't be trusted.
that's what I thought.
it was always difficult for me too, with my father.
he was always so certain and was good at everything.
you'll see, if you persevere...
...it'll work out with your daughter.
God, in his mercy, will help you...
God is going to have his hands full.
you'll see. I'm convinced.
that's sweet of you.
we're going to sleep.
Ernest?
Dammit... - You startled me.
Hey, what are you doing? - Get lost.
stop it, now. Stop it...
go away.
stop that.
quiet.
quiet. It's a misunderstanding.
get lost. - She suffered. Tomorrow we'll...
tomorrow you're out of here!
he's here. He's here. I'm not crazy.
no. He's here, I'm sure. I heard him.
I know. Quiet.
tomorrow we'll look when it's light. All right?
think first, before you interrogate everyone.
MlSSlNG:
Ernest, 5 five weeks, dark hair.
no. He's here!
you can't check all babies. You'll be lynched by the mothers.
what then?
keep looking. - No. He's here!
everyone has their own worries.
no one would take a crying baby and hide it from you.
little brother...
and mother? - Safe.
that's why you came!
what do you mean?
found what you were looking for?
Julia... A baby was found...
...in a chest...
I heard it on the way. Job found a baby in a chest.
how far away? - It's quite a way.
about two hours if we're lucky.
why are you angry? Because I looked for my own brother?
you were lying to me all along. And I believed you.
I almost forgot: You helped Koos to flee!
that's what you think? - lsn't it true?
didn't you get him work as a sailor?
I was in the merchant navy.
cape Town, Singapore, Sidney...
I always thought about you wherever I was. And about...
...about our child.
I was stupid.
Yes.
I thought maybe...
...that you and l...
can it wait?
high tide is in an hour and we're only halfway.
where does Job live?
by the locks. It's a cottage with a windmill.
thank you.
it's hard enough without a girl getting hysterical.
everyone's complaining.
she's your daughter.
you have to intervene.
that girl brought disgrace on you. - That's enough.
you don't understand me. I'm under great pressure here.
who from?
people shouldn't interfere in everything.
so you'll do something?
I can't cope. I just renovated the hotel. I lost everything.
she lost her mother, sister and child. And you complain about money?
I wasn't just talking about money. - Listen. I've had enough.
if anyone complains, send them to me.
understood?
yes... - Fine.
here.
clean nappies. - Shall I wash Wiebeke?
I did it myself. - Okay.
how old is he?
two months...
keep a close eye on him.
Why?
weren't you here this morning?
Krelis Verschoor's girl. She lost her baby.
that must be terrible.
it was her own fault. - What do you mean?
didn't you know?
no, I lived in Assen... - Unmarried.
and she acts as if it's normal...
the whole village was up in arms. It's no surprise she paid the price...
I don't know.
I think God is merciful.
I'm sorry, I have to go.
I don't want you to come along.
you don't even know his name. What's his name?
he's my son, not yours.
go back and find a nice fisherwoman. Get yourself a life.
what would you do?
Koos, that's irrelevant.
are you going on?
we won't make it before high tide. - That's quite possible.
and you carry on?
is that so?
well?
what are you doing here?
you can't imagine, can you?
what? - That you might be wrong.
everyone deserves a second chance. - Are you talking about Koos or yourself?
you had two. You lied to me. And you helped Koos to flee.
I didn't lie! Koos never told me you were pregnant!
why didn't you say so?
because I know how Koos feels about you.
but I didn't know what you felt for him.
I thought maybe you two... - You thought wrong.
you have no idea what it's like to be alone and pregnant.
the whole village looks at you. - Julia! I'm not Koos.
I don't need anyone.
Julia, we won't make it. The water is rising too fast!
Julia, stop! We have to go back to the dike.
maybe we can carry on that way.
what's the point if your baby's alive but you're dead?
you go ahead!
job!
job!
job?
job!
there's a tin behind you.
Julia, you have to bail out, otherwise we'll be swimming.
did you look at the list?
there's a missing baby on it. Five weeks old.
it could be him. - I don't think so...
my baby is older, Stien. At least two months...
your baby is dead...
...after that terrible accident.
Felix is dead.
Krina...
Felix is dead.
I know it's like a gift from God and I would...
...be very happy for you if you can keep the baby...
... but you do have to ask.
I know.
I know.
you're a gift...
I have to go back.
you're crazy. The dikes will burst. - The polder is already flooded.
I know it's hard.
but Gouda is waiting for me. I can't leave the dog.
I was just planning... It's cold here.
don't you worry.
she'll be back. I know she will.
I would have gone with her...
...but she'd already left.
there were two men with her, weren't they?
two boys...
they must know what they're doing.
Where's Julia?
she didn't want me to go... - Where is she?
going to Job Bakker's house. - You left her there?
aldo is...
dammit. If she doesn't come back...
dammit!
listen.
job found Ernest and took him somewhere. Or gave him to someone.
Yes.
and you only give a baby to someone who can get away safely.
of course. That's logical.
but we can't row around Zeeland forever.
we have to get to the mainland to where refugees are taken.
if Job gave the baby to someone, that will get recorded.
we're going back to the hotel. He's there.
you're so stubborn.
shall I row?
God bless you and have a safe trip.
hurry. The men's boats leave first. - The army's here!
men in the inflatables.
women have to wait for the sloops. Only men to the inflatables.
only one piece of baggage per person. Nothing heavy.
nothing heavy.
are you full?
you can't take that.
your boats can arrive any minute.
no women and children in inflatables. - Why not?
three have sunk. There's barbed wire everywhere.
check all the babies. - You can't.
they'll give you a straitjacket. - Straitjacket?
I want to see all the babies.
everyone is known. No one can steal your baby.
go aboard. The boat's leaving.
I'm staying.
the evacuation is not voluntary. - I'm staying too.
that's impossible.
I'm Lt Hendrickx. We have our own craft. I take responsibility.
as you wish.
we do have our own boat?
not anymore.
Stien...
may I have the list?
I just want to look...
the sloops. The sloops are here!
all go outside.
no heavy things, only babies.
what can we do when everyone's gone?
ernest has either been evacuated or...
...or he's dead.
I can't leave here.
I won't know what happened.
maybe he's been taken somewhere else. - Come on. Let's go.
we lost everything...
can you hold her?
it's a girl.
it wasn't him.
it was a girl.
I was sure I heard him...
it's not strange for you to hear him... in your head.
I'm crazy...
we can take you if you want.
it's your decision.
low tide is in an hour or two.
we could carry on searching.
no.
we're going.
she can't go with us! - She can't be trusted.
what? - Rubbish.
I vouch for her.
I don't agree.
how dare she!
I wouldn't have made it without you.
Krina... Krina... Did you ask? - He's not hers.
she saw him, Stien.
she came and tore him from my arms.
really, it was terrible.
ask anyone who... if you don't believe me...
I think she's really confused.
today, during the opening of the Haringvliet Dam...
...it is apt to honour those who were so brave in times of great danger...
...and who's great courage and vigour, in the 1953 disaster...
...helped with their bravery to save many...
...from drowning, hypothermia, hunger and thirst.
it's thanks to these people that many of you can be here today...
thank you, on behalf of the Queen. - Thank you.
thanks on behalf of the Queen. - Thank you too.
thanks on behalf of the Queen. - Thank you.
I didn't think you were coming? - Surprise.
are you all right, Mum?
I don't know if you remember me...
I never apologised for that incident with your daughter.
my mother doesn't have a daughter.
you're mistaken.
no, I'm sure.
how old are you? Eighteen?
may I speak to your mother alone?
tell me...
I...
I was very confused...
my...
...my husband, my child...
I'd just lost them... in a car crash.
I didn't know it was your child.
I didn't know any more.
I forgot. - Stop it!
I forgot.
I didn't know.
what's your name?
Felix.
Felix.
can I talk to him?
and she knew... all that time.
you have to ask her.
and... what now?
I don't know.
it was 18 years ago...
...and now you're a man.
she's been your mother all your life.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what I can do.
what's my real name?
Ernest.
Ernest? That sounds serious.
it was serious.
and is he...?
no.
but you brought us together.
I'll tell you some other time.
I really have to...
sorry...

I know how to get there.
I need you to slow down.
her office is right up here. I've been there before.
sir, you don't have clearance to walk here unescorted.

it's okay. I got it.
come with me.

Walter is at the hotel.

I still feel bad about what happened to you.
but the truth is, you don't need me here.
that isn't the truth. - It is.

strange things that need investigating, that connect somehow to the insane work that walter was doing way back when, but he's the one with the answers.
you need him. I'm just a babysitter.

no, not any more. Anybody can do that.

you're telling me that if the federal government wants to get walter bishop out of a mental institution, they can't do that without the consent of his son?
it's your father.
he's made it very clear that if you leave, he won't cooperate with our investigations.
I don't believe it.
he would rather go back to st. Claire's than work here without you.
he said that more than once.

good morning. Hello. Hello. Morning.
yesterday, there was an explosion at a construction site in williamsburg, brooklyn.
a crane collapsed.
left three dead, two dozen injured.
the public was told that it was a gas main explosion, which, technically, is the truth.
it's what caused the explosion I want you to see.
we had it transported here late last night.
we've got nsa and cdc gathering data.
but dr. Bishop, I wanted you to see this as soon as possible.
what is it? - It's why you're here.
we don't know.
it just fell from the sky?
it came from underground.
the thing blasted through an unused subway tunnel into a gas main.
underground.
came to rest right on the surface.
as if someone had carefully placed it there.
solid iridium.
we think so, yes.
subsonic vibrations?
at two megahertz, and then again at four.
this thing is vibrating?
Dr. Bishop, do you have an idea what this may be?
an idea, yes.
do you feel like sharing?
no. It's too early.
Colonel jacobson was in charge of the investigation.
spoke to him myself this morning.
he's expecting a visit.
said he's looking forward to seeing you again.
what do you wanna do?
what kind of man would take off on you the minute a can of magic space soup arrives?
who says it came from space? - It's a joke, walter.
thank you for staying.
this is the last one, olivia.
then I'm gone.
we need to get this back to the lab.
we can't risk transferring this to the university. We'd rather you st

he was at his post at the marine base on the night of june 22.
his job was to watch the motion sensors, perimeter security, to ensure that there was no breach at the base.
except on that night, the sensors went nuts.
what we found was this.
metallic cylinder, 24 inches tall, 12 inches in diameter.
he assumed it fell from the sky.
that perhaps it was a piece of a satellite.
except it wasn'T.
stranger still, although it seemed to be a solid piece of hard metal, it was vibrating.
at two megahertz.
then again at four.
there's another?
where is this one?
still at quantico?
I was called in to investigate.
we determined it was transmitting something.
a signal that we couldn't decode.
48 hours after we found it, there was an explosion unlike anything I'd ever seen.
it went through the floor to the basement below.
it exploded down.
and was gone.
I'll give you my files, whatever you need.
but this was a weird one, olivia.
and if it's happening again, as a friend,
I'd ask you to stay as far away from this thing as you can.
harvard UNIVERSITY
and what exactly is this?
in time, my dear.
Hello, sir, can I help you?
code red, code red. We have a breach in sector eight.
you.
where is it?
agent dunham.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
dispatch.
this is agent dunham. 7-18-6-22-7-9.
I need a call traced from my cell.
it just came in.
please hold.
we have no record of any calls in the last three hours.
I'm sorry.
okay. Thank you.
harvard UNIVERSITY
the precision with which this object was constructed is inspiring.
down to the molecular bonds.
I sure hope that a gigantic metallic suppository is not the pinnacle of human achievement.
what is it?
let me ask you a question.
if I tried reverse psychology, like, if I just said to you right now, "walter, don't tell me what that is," would that work?
many years ago, I worked on project thor.
the department of defense wanted a subterranean torpedo, a missile which could, in theory, be shot from anywhere in the world through the earth's core and hit its target on the other side.
I know for a fact that that is ridiculous.
open your mind, son, or someone may open it for you.
even that doesn't make any sense.
the cylinder could be any number of things, none of which I am prepared to discuss.
great, well, I am glad I stuck around for this.
I don't believe it.
what?
look.
it's one of the photos from jacobson's file. Him. Remember?
the bald guy.
no, who is he?
that's the point.
Olivia, you're starting to sound like walter.
there are many things I'm not good at, too many, but one thing I can do, that I've always been able to do, that game, concentration.
memory. Connecting things. Putting them together.
see. Two weeks ago at the hospital.
that's him.
no way.
can I help you?
still photograph from the crime scene at quantico, 1987.
look. He was there. Look at this.
less than two weeks ago at the hospital in quincy. It's the same guy.
and he looks the same. And he was there with us.
what?
come with me.
excuse us, please.
it took us a year to spot him.
you did it in three weeks.
who the hell is this guy?
that is one excellent question.
you've run him through every database? - Of course.
and there's nothing on him? Nothing at all?
no positive id.
we've recorded him at over three dozen scenes, all of which relate to the pattern.
how? Why? What is he doing?
what it looks like he's doing.
he's watching. Observing.
which is why we refer to him as the observer.
but what he wants and why he's there, we don't know.
and he was there the other day?
in new york at the construction site?
when did it happen?
okay, turn it on.
what is that?
it's called sound.
I know that, thank you. What's the point?
I need to compare the numbers, confirm my suspicions.
compare them to what? Suspicions of what?
I'll explain later.
no, I want you to explain right now.
I want to know what the hell this tin can is.
Peter? It's olivia.
Hello?
there's been an attack, peter.
the team at the warehouse is dead.
what? Who did it?
I don't know, but we're moving that thing to a secure facility.
I'm on my way. - Got it.
Walter, whatever the hell that thing is, you should have never brought it here.
why do you say this?
has someone come for it?
why would you ask that?
have they? - Yes.
then we need to keep this safe.
we need something-- something very important. - What?
aluminum foil. - Why?
trust me.
no, thank you. - Damn it!
must you always be such a smart ass?
I need the aluminum foil right now to shield the frequencies of the cylinder.
your life depends on it.
all our lives depend on it. Go now.
I'm gonna go get you your aluminum foil, and then when I get back, you're gonna tell me what the hell it is you think that thing does.
while you're out, if you see a chance to get me a root beer float, that would be wonderful.
I'll see what I can do.
would you be a lamb and get me that syringe?
sure.
thank you.
I got the tin foil!
Astrid! Astrid! Are you okay? Astrid, look at me, astrid.
Hey, focus, focus for a second. Where is walter?
someone came to you.
think about her.
I know you were there. The last time.
and she's come to you now.
think about that woman
don't play with me.
now you tell me now, or I'll do that again. Think.
see? That was easy.
bless you.
I haven't had a root beer float in 17 years.
And? How is it?
heavenly.
and earthly at the same time.
quite the connoisseur.
do you want some?
no, thank you.
I wouldn't taste much anyway.
17 years.
that's a long time to go without something you love.
where I've been, you lose track of time.
so much now to make up for.
thank you for hiding the beacon.
I can't touch it myself.
I know you have questions.
soon you'll have answers.
of course.
Dr. Walter bishop, I'm forwarding his photo right now.
I want surveillance posted outside his last known residence.
this is getting annoying.
please do not stand there and tell me that you have no idea where your father
you're assuming I have any understanding of how that man's addled brain works.
you gave us the impression that you could handle him.
Hey, let's get something straight. I didn't promise you anything.
I warned you from the word go.
agent dunham.
thank god. Where?
we'll be right there.
Walter just got picked up, walking the median of I-95.
thank you.
if it's possible, I would very much like my own clothes back.
let me explain how this works to you, walter.
you can't inject a federal officer with sedatives, steal government property, and then escape from protective custody, and then ask to be not treated like a criminal.
this isn't about me.
maybe it is, peter.
you took the cylinder. Do you remember that?
Yes, of course.
what would you like to know about it?
where is it?
I can't tell you that.
but I can tell you that someone is coming to seek the cylinder. Thus, I had to hide it.
and I don't recall where or from whom.
we need you to remember.
it may be dangerous, and we need to help keep people safe.
tell me what it is.
if I--if I attempted to explain it, you--you might think me mad.
don't worry. There's no chance of that happening.
I believe there are only another four hours in which I must keep the cylinder from thosewho are trying to get it, a theory I have discussed with my friend, who agrees with me.
your friend? Um, he's a tall fellow, right? Pink, big fuzzy ears.
no, he's a man. Quite nice.
albeit extremely bald.
no eyebrows either.
it's disturbing, but you get accustomed to it.
you talked to him.
do you really think it's a good idea to feed into his delusions at this point?
Walter, who is he?
where can we find him?
Oh, you won't be able to find him.
Oh, of course not,'cause he's in the seventh dimension.
he's shy.
though he wouldn't be any use to you.
he just observes.
Walter, you haven't talked to this man.
you've seen him in olivia's photographs, so cut out the gibberish and just tell us where the cylinder is.
must you always be so small-minded?
damn it, don't be like her. Like your mother.
questioning my judgment. I am not a child.
I will not be babied.
thank you for that.
that's exactly what I needed.
guilt relieved.
Olivia, I am very sorry, but I think you'll understand why I don't want to hang around any longer.
I upset him, didn't I?
where are we?
I couldn't tell you. Walter's hiding something.
he's being as cryptic as ever.
he says he had to keep the cylinder safe.
that someone is looking for it.
welcome to the joys of walter bishop.
where did he take it?
you'll have to ask walter. He won't tell me.
apparently, he had a meeting with a man matching the description of our friend.
the bald guy.
well, I know a lot of bald guys.
the observer.
are you saying walter's saying he knows him?
I'm saying he's not cooperating.
I'm saying I'm confused.
Hey, man. Thanks for calling me back so fast.
look, don't start with me right now, okay?
well, guess what, I'm calling this time to ask for a favor too.
Nah, I need some work.
well, I don't really care. As long as it puts some money in my pocket.
anywhere but boston.
okay.
agent dunham?
agent farnsworth is on the phone.
I don't know. About an hour ago?
when he left, he was pretty upset with walter.
maybe he just finally left.
no, there was a struggle here.
I'll check it out. Thanks, astrid.
call harvard campus security.
there's a closed-circuit camera outside countway library aimed at the kresge building.
I need footage going back two hours.
you don't work for big eddie, do you?
look, I think you got the wrong guy.
what I'm saying is...
whatever it is you want, I don't think I'm gonna be able to give it to you.
no, no!
you have something I need.
tell me where it is.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer honestly.
what's the most pain you've ever felt in your life?
this was taken outside your lab.
have you ever seen this man before?
I don't believe so, no.
something's happened, yes? Something unfortunate. What is it?
I believe this man may have abducted peter.
that's not-- no.
Peter will lead him to it. - To what?
the cylinder? - Yes.
how? Did you tell him where you put it?
no, of course not.
I don't need to.
you and your colleagues had the cylinder last. Where is it now?
I have no idea.
and even if I did, you're the last person I would tell.
but you just did tell me.
your father hid it. Where?
and yes, to answer your question, when this is over, I just might kill you.
it depends on a few things.
when was the last time your father kissed you?
I think that's your lamest question yet.
yeah?
think about your father.
good.
now think about a time before he was sent away to the institution.
a happy time, a time when you still believed that your father loved you.
beside his car in your old house, does your father have any other hiding places?
answer the question. Does your father ha
thank you. You just told me where the cylinder is.
come with me.
shame you never met him.
come on.
dig.
careful.
Hey, olivia. Over here.
are you okay? - Yeah. He went that way.
go. He's got a gun.
departure on schedule.
who the hell are you?
what is the cylinder?
you know what it is, don't you?
why is it here? Why now?
who are you?
apples, bananas, rhinoceros.
I want to hold your hand.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
do you really know my father?
did you talk to him this afternoon?
are you his friend?
Peter. Is he all right?
he's fine.
he has a mild concussion, but he's gonna be fine.
thank you. That's wonderful news.
come on. I'm gonna take you back to your hotel.
if you don't mind, there's something I'd like to do first.
what I did to you was very untrustworthy of me.
I never intended to harm you.
I was simply doing what was necessary to protect us all.
if it would help you feel a sense of retribution, I would tell you to inject me too.
but I'd most likely enjoy it.
Hi, peter bishop, he was brought in about an hour ago.
excuse me.
are you okay?
Yeah. I'm fine.
so did we recover the cylinder?
we dug out the hole, but there's no sign of it.
as soon as the sun comes up, we'll bring in an excavator, but somehow,
I don't have an expectation we'll find it.
so it just disappeared.
we I. D.'D the shooter. John mosley.
wanted for a double homicide in seattle last month.
a few drug-related felonies before that.
Seattle.
came a long way to try and get that thing.
I should get back.
as you can imagine, there are some interagency fires to quash.
NSA considered that device their personal property.
they're looking for an explanation.
so I'll see you tomorrow?
Yeah.
you ready to get out of here?
something happened out there tonight, olivia.
the pattern that broyles refers to, I always thought it was nonsense.
inexplicable things happen every single day.
it does not mean that there's any deeper significance.
I know this is gonna sound insane.
Yeah, I know it sounds insane, but that man out there in the woods, he knew me.
and I don't know how, but he was inside my head.
he knew what I was going to say before I said it.
the man I shot?
no, the other guy, the bald guy. From your photos. Mr. No brows?
Peter, I didn't see anyone.
what if this is just the beginning?
listen, you took a pretty bad blow to the head.
you think I did this to myself?
no, I just-- I was wrong to-- to demand that you stay here.
Walter is not your responsibility.
as you've always said, this was just supposed to be temporary.
you have your life.
Olivia, did you hear what I just said?
I mean, I'm a fairly open-minded guy, but there are things happening here that I can't even begin to explain.
and I am not going anywhere until I can.
in that case, you might want this.
your credentials have been approved.
civilian consultant to the department of homeland security.
does this mean I don't need an escort to come into the federal building anymore?
Yeah.
will it get me out of speeding tickets?
maybe.
so let me tell you about my day, walter.
I was abducted, tortured, had two wires shoved up my nose that were connected to a machine I've never seen before.
but maybe the strangest part of the day is that somehow, without talking,
I was able to answer a question that I didn't have the answer to.
where I buried the capsule?
how did I know that, walter?
I didn't know that.
you know it, son, because I know it.
no, I didn't know because you didn't tell me.
I didn't have to.
you must adjust the way you consider communications, ideas.
ideas can be absorbed through osmosis.
through proximity.
do you remember the night of the accident when you were young? I was driving
of course, I remember. - Your mother was at home.
of course, I remember. Thanksgiving dinner.
she was anxious for us to get there, join everyone.
when the car went off the road, the ice was so thick that it held the vehicle for what must have been two minutes.
what does this have to do with what happened today?
I regained consciousness, I saw your body...
contorted horribly, and I reached for you.
but the ice broke.
and we sank into that dark water.
and then you swam to shore and saved us both. I know.
no.
I was unable to control my limbs in that icy water.
it wouldn't respond.
I was incapable of saving you. Or myself.
we were dead, peter, you and I.
until someone grabbed me.
and we were going up.
we were saved, both of us, by a man that I had never met.
a man that shouldn't have been there at all.
he pulled us to the shore.
I remembered that he was bald, that he had no eyebrows.
and as he set us down in the snow, I recalled his stare, standing there in his suit soaking wet, seemingly indifferent to the cold.
it was as if he knew my thoughts before I did.
as if he were inside my head.
without speaking, he made it clear that he would need me one day.
a return favor, so to speak.
and this is it.
today, what happened with the capsule,
I'm not sure how I knew about the vibrations, the composition.
but then when I tested it myself, heard the vibrations, felt them, it was as if an envelope had been opened and I could finally read my instructions.
instantly, I knew I had to protect the capsule. For him.
who they are, what they want-- as a man of science,
I share your frustration in not having these answers.
but what I know is that you are sitting here now...
my son... alive.
I know you must think me insane.
not nearly as much as you might think.
Hello, liv.
keep everyone back. Never were much to look at.
Oh, to us maybe. For all we know, this one's a prime specimen, the Brad Pitt of skitter world.
porter says we have to try to communicate with this thing.
figure out how it thinks, we can figure out how to beat it.
you actually think you'll figure a way to talk to it?
I get it in a controlled environment, give it a shot.
a lot depends on what it's got underneath the hood.
I wouldn't underestimate them. See the eyes?
it's studying us as much as we're studying them.
I mean, even if he wanted to chat, vocalizations could extend above or below the range of human hearing. I mean, for all we know, he could be cussing us out right now.
I can almost guarantee it.
get that damn thing in the cage!
all right, get that thing in the cage! Get him in!
get him in there!
Yeah.
I remember you, too.
well, uh, it seems to have settled for now.
might want to keep your distance.
I might.
time for our patient's morning fix.
meet me in the command post in five.
this bike shop, right? Anyway, she calls me up.
she's like, "hey, Johnny, you want a new ride?" I'm like...
captain.
Pope tells me there's a motorcycle shop near somerville.
it's well off the main highway, so there's a chance it's not picked clean.
I want you to take a team, check it out.
wait, what?
you're sending me after bikes? No.
my team's ready to get Ben. Porter gave us permission.
he gave you permission to rescue one kid.
that kid turned out to be Rick.
doesn't change what I need to do. I understand that.
I also understand that Mike's son is a work in progress and Harris is going through the last of our heavy drugs on the detox. So we'll get more.
Yes, we will.
and it will be a hell of a lot easier when we have more bikes.
one objective leads to the next.
first the bikes, then the drugs, then your son.
all right.
so, when do we leave? You don't.
Pope knows where it is. He could draw me a map.
if I'm doing this, I'm doing it with people I trust.
it's your call, but I scored my last ride from this place.
I know the layout. I know the streets.
and I can't draw for crap.
we're down one rider since we lost Karen.
I talk, you listen, and no weapon.
you go unarmed.
unarmed? What am I, Canadian?
good luck. Thank you.
no congestion.
his lungs are completely clear.
I know this is gonna sound weird, but are you sure Rick had cystic fibrosis?
five specialists in three states" sure.
before the invasion, he could barely breathe.
I had to put him on a nebulizer twice a day just to clear his lungs.
Why?
I'm no expert, but full remission like this is extremely rare.
meaning what?
that...thing that he had on his back cured him?
I don't know.
when's he gonna wake up?
Dr. Harris said later today.
how is Rick? We're weaning him off opiates.
24 hours and we should know if we have him back.
look, I totally understand if you're holding back with Mike, but I really want to know everything. So how dangerous is this?
as surgery? Not very.
as long as we have enough drugs to counteract the harness, it's basically cutting steel.
I'm sorry you couldn't get Ben.
I know. Mike is torn up about what happened.
Yeah, well, it's just a man trying to save his son.
so this morning's attitude was for Harris.
I noticed he couldn't get away from you fast enough.
I appreciate your concern over my state of mind.
I am your doctor.
I, uh...
Harris told me that he saw my wife die, and it's hard for me to look at him and not remember that.
Oh, God.
I'm sorry.
at least she was with a friend.
Yeah.
um, I got to go.
sir, they're back. You were due back two hours ago.
recon takes longer when you're on foot.
the transportation issue's being addressed. What's your report?
I saw some harness kids being led into that hospital off of route 2.
same hospital you saw before?
it looks like they're still using it as a home base.
and one of your fighter jocks thought they saw Mason's kid.
any sign of Karen? Didn't see her.
right. Dismissed.
captain, I don't mind taking orders, but I'd appreciate it if you'd tell your fighters I'm not the enemy.
you had them keeping tabs on me, didn't you?
I did. You were found with Pope.
I was in his vicinity. I wasn't with him.
if it weren't for me, you wouldn't have a second-in-command.
those convicts trusted you with a gun.
that whole time you were with them, you never thought about using it before?
Yeah, every second of every day.
on myself at first.
and then on them.
what about now?
I'm just taking it a day at a time.
all right? Yep.
we ready? Ready.
dad.
Matt, what are you doing here? You should be in class.
I ditched when I heard you were leaving.
I want to come with you. Sorry, shrimp.
you got to be that tall to ride.
but I mean it. I want to help. You are helping by going to class, keeping an eye on things while Hal and I are gone.
but I can fight, too.
some of the other kids are learning how to load guns, even shoot.
well, that's the other kids. But, dad... Matt, I said no.
we'll be back soon. Go on. Go back to class.
Scott, will you take him? Yeah, come on. Come on, Matt.
you're not doing your boy any favors, you know.
skitter's come knocking, the kid should at least have a chance to defend himself.
if I want any parenting advice from an ex-con,
I'll ask for it.
you know, Pope's got a point.
Matt deserves a childhood.
one day, when you have kids, you'll understand.
me? Kids?
dream on.
I will.
how much farther? Half a mile or so.
what the hell you grinning about?
I'm just enjoying the air.
didn't mean to piss off the company gangbanger.
black man with a gun... that's your default?
I just call them as I see them.
so, what were you?
blood? Crips? Slytherin?
actually, Mr. Pope,
I was part of the biggest gang in the world.
I was Boston P. D. Thought I smelled a little ham.
you know what?
you know, you laugh that up, convict. Okay?
because one of these days when we don't need you anymore, me and you... we're gonna have a little talk about my friend Click.
being awfully quiet.
I got nothing to talk about. Well, if you want to talk...
look, dad, I just got some things to think about, okay?
but thank you.
this thing with Karen... it must be rough.
Oh, it's gonna be rough for a while.
when you see him like this, like a soldier, it's easy to forget that he's only 16.
he's holding it all in.
well, he's his mother's son.
with me, it was always kind of like talking to a brick wall, but Rebecca...
she kind of always knew the right thing to say.
Yeah.
time like this, I miss her a lot.
what do you think she would have told him?
I don't know, but it would have been perfect.
maybe I'm lucky.
I didn't have anyone when they hit.
I see you worry about them... Hal, Matt.
wouldn't want that.
Oh, I worried about them before the invasion, too.
trust me... Hal with a set of car keys is just as frightening as a mech.
same worries, higher stakes.
Hey, come on, guys. Let's hurry it up!
sooner we get those bikes, sooner we can go after Ben.
W-what are you doing?
um, saying a prayer for the missing.
it's just something I like to do.
you think it helps them?
it helps me. You don't know any of these people.
you're not even from Boston.
I heard you talking to Hal one night about how you grew up in Mexico city.
well, my mom and dad bought a house here when I was 10, and my dad would go back and forth for business while I went to school.
I was freshman pre-med at Wellesley when they attacked.
Wellesley's not in Boston. It's in Wellesley.
okay, 617 snob, my parents' house was in J. P.
is that Boston enough for you?
W-what part of J. P?
the part where people lost their faith.
earth. This planet.
so, this is your game plan? Our planet.
show it pictures, hope it says the word in skitterese?
our galaxy.
stars.
outer space.
well, you know, if that doesn't work, you can try exchanging recipes.
no curiosity, no fear, no remorse.
maybe that's why it's so easy for them to kill us.
believe what you want.
but I think it's scared out of its mind.
I wonder what it sees when it's looking at us.
are we as hideous to it? As strange?
Yeah, that's a good question.
I got an idea.
this the radio you wanted to show me?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I made it out of an old fallout-shelter survival kit
I found in the basement. Doesn't need a battery?
no, you just crank up the handle to power it up.
you could listen to the Red Sox game.
the other regiments will be working on their radios.
we need to monitor the frequencies, see if they're up and running.
but I don't want it to take you away from making explosives.
that's what I was thinking, which is why I brought along a very capable volunteer.
come on.
see, all he has to do is wind the handle and slowly turn the dial.
he's looking for something to do.
right.
guess what.
I just made you the communications officer.
cool.
we need to stay inside the tree line.
Pope! I knew I smelled something.
Skitters.
you'll wake 'em.
so, they fly across the universe and wipe out mankind and they sleep like bats.
at least they're sleeping and not having skitter group sex.
I didn't think they slept during the day at all.
they're not nocturnal.
I'm guessing they catch a pile of shut-eye whenever and wherever they can.
just like soldiers anywhere.
Mechs... north and South. Active?
sleep mode.
what the hell are you waiting for?
let's hose 'em! As much as I love to kill skitters, as soon as we open up on them, those mechs are gonna open up on us.
engaging them is not the mission.
let's go.
they're like fish in a barrel.
can we get around them?
stick to the trees, go past, double back.
only adds a half mile.
water?
are you thirsty? Want some water?
it's okay.
get your damn hand out of there.
what are you doing?
I thought we might try to provoke it with a little visual stimuli.
Hey, chief.
you remember that skitter that Pope and his boys killed.
watch this. Remember this guy?
what was that?
static.
I know.
it wasn't there a moment ago.
lock! No!
want a friend? Get a dog.
and may we be truly thankful.
in the name of the father, of the son, the holy spirit.
what?
you're lucky you still believe in something.
did I hear right?
Mason and his crew are taking Pope on this motorcycle raid?
you got a problem with that?
no, I don't. But they will.
this place didn't get hit like they did down...
watch out there... didn't get hit like they did downtown, but the, uh, the cooties...
I tell you, they sure as hell made their presence known.
actually, I scored one of my first rides from this place.
all right, let's check the tanks.
probably empty, but you never know.
mi Negra Amor. And just the off-roads.
we don't need any recliners on wheels.
professor, you have no sense of style.
is that the kind of bike you bought here, Pope?
Oh, I never bought a bike here. I said I got a bike here.
I sure as hell didn't buy it. Hell, I didn't even need it.
I was just trying to impress a lady. It worked, too.
pretty proud of your criminal past, aren't you?
I was good at it.
they're all empty. There's a repair bay back here, couple of bikes in pieces, tanks of gas.
all right, take Pope, see if you can find another empty gas can we can fill and take back with us.
let's put some gas in these things, see if we can start them up.
it's Dai, right? What do they call you for short?
if there's anything else you think we could use back there, grab it.
well, this is gonna suck.
Karen would have loved this.
what would Karen have loved?
she's no girly girl, at least not since we knew her, probably never was, but...
she'd have taken this.
we can leave an I. O.U.
Nah.
we're not giving up on her. Oh, I know.
I just...Can't help think about what's happened.
well, I don't think Karen would want you to blame yourself.
she's a high-school senior, dad. She's not a soldier.
she should have never even been put in that situation.
well, we all wish that had gone differently.
listen, Karen knew how dangerous it was, and she came anyway because she knew how much getting Ben back means to us.
so, that's it? We should move on?
I think...
your mom might have said to...
hold on to the memory and let the rest of it come.
actually, she would have said "suck it up.
Really?
and I'm sorry, but if that was your attempt at parental advice, that was pretty lame.
she was always better at that than me.
Yeah, she was.
come on.
let's go see if we can help Anthony with those bikes.
you can't cut into it. It's a living creature.
it's a skitter. It's not a human being. At most, it's vivisection.
you can't tell me you got a problem with vivisection or you never would have made it through med school.
our job is to communicate with it, not just make it scream.
how's pumpkinhead doing with his abcs?
if there's a way that we can figure out what it wants and learn about our enemy...
we know what it wants. It wants to exterminate us!
look, they killed my family.
I would like nothing more than to take an ax and cut that thing's head off.
but Porter's orders were clear. We need to attempt communication.
I believe he's right.
that's a very noble speech. That's very noble.
but it's my call.
I'm not gonna be second-guessed by a pediatrician.
who are you?
it's me. It's dad.
who are you?
I'm...
I'm your father.
father?
father.
so...
that boy in there... he's my son.
he's everything to me, the only thing that kept me going.
and when he woke up just now, he didn't know me.
but he's here, and he's healthy, probably because of the harness you put on him.
that's why you get this chance to live or not.
Hey, Annie.
you guys hungry? Is something wrong?
you usually only seek me out when you need advice on a personal problem.
I've been busy. You've been hiding.
Annie, sweetheart, you can keep pretending that everything's all right, but after what you've been through...
you're alive right now because they want to know if you're capable of communicating with us.
I want you to talk to me.
explain yourself.
we're gonna start simple.
all you got to do is point one of your fingers at any picture here and make a sound.
how did you find our planet?
what made you decide to attack us?
so, maybe you didn't understand me.
or you need some motivation.
I didn't... I didn't touch it.
it's nice to hear static again.
Yeah, we've been hearing these short bursts every now and then, but... This low wash just...
just happened a minute ago.
what's causing it?
I haven't the faintest idea.
I'm not gonna shoot you. Now we're getting somewhere.
point at a picture and make a sound.
don't you look at my son!
you look at the pictures and make a sound.
point and speak.
I said speak!
I was just trying to make it talk.
by sticking a gun in its mouth?
our skitter's breathing and heart seem fine.
so why'd it just collapse?
uh, well, in dissections, I found a nerve bundle located just above the soft palate. Could be a pressure point.
there's no bone to separate the brain from the soft palate, so you probably gave it a concussion.
you knocked it out. So, it's vulnerable.
well, yeah, I suppose, but if you're close enough to put a gun in its mouth,
I suggest pulling the trigger.
so, this just happened five minutes ago?
you wanted to see me?
Dr. Glass wants to go in for a treasure hunt inside the skitter's skull.
Why? Is this the skitter that Mike attacked in the lab?
no. This is the one that Pope and his boys shot.
we're gonna open him up. I-I'm not sure I follow.
tell Dr. Harris how you heard those loud bursts of static on your radio.
okay, well, there was, uh, one right around lunch.
Yeah, and the second burst...
Mm...Well, you were with me.
Yeah, it's the same time Mike was sticking a gun in the skitter's mouth.
she thinks the static may be caused by the skitter's reaction.
you're not saying that the skitters have radios in their heads?
Oh, yeah, that's exactly what she's saying.
so what should I be looking for here? Tubes? Transistors?
subwoofer? No?
well, there's one.
all right, let's see what else we can get started.
this thing's drier than a nun in west Texas.
you got all there is? Let's go.
what happened? I don't know. Guess he clocked me.
great. No wonder he wanted to help us with the motorcycles.
he was planning on bolting the whole time.
one less mouth to feed. You all right? Yeah, I think so.
rise and shine.
that wasn't good.
what is that? - It looks like Pope's work.
that's gonna draw some attention.
find anything?
the corpse is too old.
it was mush in there.
Oh, well, there's your proof right there.
of what? What? That the skitter and the static are unrelated.
it's not being provoked. We're all in here.
it's alone.
I mean, unless it's out there hanging itself right now. Ricky's in there.
no, no, no, no! Get back! Hold him, hold him, hold him!
get that thing off of him!
what do you want from us?
you want to hurt me.
we just want to know why you're here.
what the hell does he think he's doing?
he thinks he's talking to the skitter.
so, what do you want?
let me go.
no, I can't do that.
this child is one of ours.
not anymore. We cut off his harness.
then I'll be punished. - We're gonna help you.
help me? We're gonna help you, Ricky.
shut up. He's not your son.
how can we help you?
kill me. Stop it, stop it!
he put the harness on.
he wanted to wear it.
how could he do that to himself?
did you find Pope? Only what he left behind.
he blew up that skitter nest. Where's your bike?
I ditched it after I saw what's coming up the road.
kids, harness kids, heading our way.
Oh, man.
what do we do, dad? Hold your fire!
there must be a skitter nearby, guiding them, giving them orders.
Aah! Come on, come on!
you okay? I've been better.
what are we gonna do?
I don't know.
I know it's horrible... And I hate it, but...
No!
look, man, we got to defend ourselves.
we're not shooting kids!
look for the skitter controlling them.
if we stop it, maybe we can stop them.
they move together.
they seem to only shoot when there's a target.
you all right? Still with me? Oh, yeah.
I think we found your skitter.
what about those kids?
next time.
Skitters have mechs, superior weaponry.
why do they need to harm children? Human shield.
we've been doing it for thousands of years...
psychological warfare.
it worked.
you couldn't shoot them. No one would be able to.
well, we'll figure it out. There's a silver lining.
I'm not seeing it. Well, the more that we get to know them, the more we see they're not so different from us, which means we can understand them, which means we might be able to gain them back.
we figure out how, we got a good shot at beating them.
we're a long way from figuring that out.
well, we know a hell of a lot more about them today than we did yesterday.
you know, your optimism's starting to get a little annoying.
would it help if I was a pessimist?
Hey, captain, tomorrow, I'm gonna start looking for the drugs we need for those operations, and then I'm gonna go get Ben and as many kids as I can grab.
permission granted.
if mine were still out there, nothing on this earth could keep me from going after them.
I didn't know you still had this. It's the last one, right?
deathly hallows." Yes.
we were halfway through it when the attack happened.
I figured I'd hang on to it.
we could finish it when we get him back.
he was a huge fan.
he came to me one time and told me he wished he was nearsighted so that he could have glasses like Harry.
Yeah.
I think we both knew that he was getting a bit old for his dad to be reading him stories.
we made an exception for Harry.
think he'll be all right when we get him back?
Yeah, I do.
Hey, dad...
I have a feeling that Ben might be a little different now.
I mean, you've seen him.
well, I've seen him with a harness on.
I mean, you heard what Harris said.
they're pumping drugs and God knows what else into those kids.
Yeah, yeah.
after we get it off of him, I'm sure he's gonna...
I-I hope so.
but when he took Karen, he was staring at me, and it wasn't our Ben staring back.
dad.
I know my son.
he's stronger than you think.
he's gonna be fine.
don't forget to eat, huh?
the good news is the radio transmissions aren't very strong.
otherwise, our skitter would have signaled his friends, and they would have attacked us already.
that is good news.
aside from that, just a quiet day at the shop, huh?
Yeah, other than that.
Oh, Matt got a job. A job?
uncle Scott's assistant.
that's perfect.
he's been needing something to do.
I know.
he really misses you en you're not here.
we all do.
dinnertime. What are you doing?
right now? I'm starving.
don't you dare put weight on that leg.
Unh-unh-unh. I'm gonna get you a crutch.
I'll meet up with you later. Okay.
what are you thinking?
I hear you're scouting pharmacies. Word travels fast.
well, everything within a 20-mile radius is picked clean.
then I'll go 30.
there's, uh, there's another option.
Hey, dad, check this out. Is that real bread?
I haven't tasted fresh-baked bread in months.
Yeah, it's a farewell gift from Pope.
he's a liar and a deserter, but the son of a bitch can cook.
come on. Dad.
it smells good. Hey, I heard you got a job.
dear God, we thank you for this meal and for this safe place we live in.
we know not everyone is as lucky as we are tonight.
really think we're lucky?
Yeah, I think we can still appreciate what we have in our life, even now.
I'm thankful for the motorcycles and the chance we have of bringing back the people we love.
and I'm grateful we found each other so we don't have to go through these times alone.
well, I'm grateful for this bread, even if it did come from Pope.
how about it, Dai? Worth a trip to the chow line?
Yeah, it was.
dai is high as a freaking kite. He is loving this bread.
dai speaks about himself in the third person now?
Yes, Dai does.
did you get some of that bread, captain?
I will.
not bad.
you should say something again.
heavenly father, for everything you've given us and especially for our connection to each other...
may we be truly thankful.
in the name of the father, of the son, and of the holy spirit, amen.
Amen.
batteries.
why don't they just come?
what are they waiting for?
Godot.
okay.
what letter comes next?
march, April, May, June, July,
august, September, October, "n" -- November.
who's chasing you, man?
batteries. - Oh, right. Here you go.
try this one, Einstein.
I'm looking for a word.
the first two letters indicate a male, the first three a female, the first four a great man, the whole word a great woman.
what's the word?
tricky.
if I wanted to go to school, I would've stayed home.
nice talking with you.
got it -- he, her, hero, heroine.
Yeah, that's way too easy.
I thought the bubbleheads put up a safety net around Charleston.
that's why God made people like you, Craze -- not to think.
what I'm trying to say is, if they did, why is it necessary for Mason to have us practically living out here?
she's got a point.
what the hell do you think's gonna happen if we get invaded while those bubbleheaded bastards are over there roasting wienies in their compound, huh?
we all get scorched.
I'm not taking any chances.
maybe the Professor's wrong. Maybe the fishheads aren't coming.
Oh, they're coming.
you can throw out a mosquito net the size of Texas. What happens, huh?
one always gets through. That's why we're here.
they are coming. If not today, tomorrow.
and if not tomorrow, the day after that.
and when they do get here, I am gonna fry me some fishhead ass.
little man, what do you got for me?
all the good stuff. - Yeah?
Yeah.
I got you some cinnamon buns. - Cinnamon buns, huh?
coffee.
all right.
you're gonna make one hell of a thief one day, kid.
Thanks.
Oh, this is great. Where'd you get all this stuff?
he looks like Frankenstein.
at least he's walking without crutches.
Yeah, I thought he'd be happier about it.
I'm happier about it.
how are you, Maggie?
long day.
looks like my day is just beginning.
what I'm saying is, is outside the military, there's maybe four people that know exactly how this place runs.
what are you worried about?
what am I worried about?
I'm worried about picking somebody strong enough to stand up to them if anything should happen to me.
any of the guys you're considering can do the job, but unless you're planning on being impeached or getting a stroke,
I don't think we have to worry about it.
in the last two years,
I've been kidnapped, tortured, shot, implanted with an eye worm.
last week, I was almost torn apart by a harnessed kid and contaminated by a nuclear reactor.
I think we can count on something happening, don't you?
I thought I was supposed to have Anthony's report on that investigation on my desk yesterday.
I talked to him this morning. You'll have it by the end of the day.
thank you.
Jeanne? We gonna be ready by tonight?
8: 00, right?
unless the world falls off its axis.
we'll be ready.
you know, when you first pitched me this idea, I wasn't too sure about it.
but now I see what you're going for.
the tree of life.
the tree of life.
the tree of...Liberty. Liberty Tree.
Yeah. The Liberty Tree. I like that.
this is good. Carry on.
I'm gonna have to make a speech.
I'm gonna need some kind of speech.
here -- it's boilerplate, but it'll give you something to work with.
Hey, where you going? - I got to hit the bushes.
take your snow tires.
all right.
she's old enough to be your grandmother, kid.
I heard that!
I wasn't talking to you.
Ah, give the kid a break, pope.
it's probably the most exciting thing he's ever seen.
that true? - Pretty much.
Oh, man. That is sad.
you stay down, kid. You hear me? Down.
path clear?
I'm on it! Go!
I got this!
craze? - What's going on?
what's going on is this stupid vest just saved your ass.
son of a bitch! Come on, look. We got to move!
Pope! Pope! I can't see. - Let's go!
don't move, okay? I'll be right back.
No! Don't leave me!
craze, you fell on a piece of rebar.
it's sticking into the back of your head. You can't feel that?
no.
I'm gonna get some -- I'm gonna get some help, okay?
I will be right back. You do not move.
Tector! - Go!
I need a hacksaw.
what's up? - We're taking fire on the perimeter, Tom.
how bad? - I'm not sure.
right now, it seems to be confined to the northern sector.
the 2nd Mass is out there -- Ben, Matt.
could be an advance. Could be a probe.
or it could be the Espheni offensive the rebel Skitters have been warning us about.
I got to get up there.
Mr. President, you being out there isn't gonna change a damn thing till we know what we're dealing with.
you'll be here, right?
where else would I be?
then you don't need me.
all right.
you seen your brother?
came by, changed our batteries, and headed out.
what do we got? - Ghosts. Lots of firepower.
harnessed kids? - Don't know.
how many? - At least six, maybe more.
on me, Tom!
cover me!
cover me.
Dan, please tell me that's not a human being.
what the hell?
Where's he from? - I don't know.
if he's the real deal, he could be an expeditionary force or he could be some nut job who ransacked an army-surplus store.
we should try and talk to them, let them know we're on the same side.
he's right. If they were interested in talking, they would've approached us before they attacked us.
listen, we can't afford to be having this fight right now, not with the Espheni invasion hanging over our heads.
I don't like the idea. - I don't like it, either.
Ben! If anybody comes for this guy, we want them alive!
Yes, sir!
Tec? That you?
no. It's just the kid, Craze.
come on. Come on down here. I need your help.
I need you to hold her head, all right?
very firmly, but very gently, okay?
move her hair back.
what's wrong?
nothing.
then why did you stop?!
would you shut your cake hole for two seconds and let me do this?
just pull it out!
stop moving!
okay. Okay.
don't.
mommy.
I'm going crazy.
Anne, hey. What happened?
I'm okay. I'm fine.
like you were "fine" the other night?
Anne...Talk to me. W-what's going on?
I want to help.
I was trying to take her blood.
and she said, "don't," and pulled her foot away.
then, when I was examining her blood in the microscope, she said, Mommy.
and when I turned around, she was standing there in the crib...
looking at me, Lourdes.
just looking at me.
W-w-why were you taking her blood? Is something wrong with her?
it's not normal, Lourdes.
whatever it is, whatever's going on with her, it is not normal!
okay. Okay. I believe you.
I'm just trying to help.
you seen my son?
he's next door with Pope.
Matt?! - Dad?!
stay where you are! - I got him, Professor.
what do you got? - Library. Upper right side.
you sure? - Yeah.
I saw the muzzle flash. He's there.
that's where I'd be.
so, what are we up against, Professor?
I'm not sure -- human beings.
what the hell they got against us?
that's the $64 million question.
Medevacs are in.
WESTERN sector reports two Humvees moving out across the Cooper River bridge.
okay.
if he's in there, he just lost his ride home.
you ready?
Hey! We're humans over here!
stop shooting! We want to talk!
can you hear me?!
so much for talking.
he...
she is still alive.
we can't question her if she's dead.
this bitch shot Craze.
killing her won't change that, son.
you sure this is gonna work?
just hold her still, okay?
Yeah. Don't distract him, kid. He might cut off your fingers.
I had this dog when I was a kid.
man, that dog could do tricks.
I'd put a treat on her nose, and she'd just sit there for, like, five minutes.
she could smile, too.
she had the most beautiful smile.
what was her name?
Sounds...regal.
Yeah.
Yeah, she was.
till her hind legs went out and she started pissing all over the house.
then, one day... she just won't eat anymore.
that's a real uplifting story, Craze.
shut up. I'm trying to make a point here.
what's your point?
my point is...
her time had come, you know?
time for what?
Pope knows.
we're gonna get you out of here.
I'm not gonna let you die in this hole, okay?
I promise.
keep sawing.
Oh, I didn't know you were back. - Cancel my afternoon meetings.
Tom, can I talk to you? - I'm sorry, Lourdes.
I don't really have time right now. - It's about Anne.
thank you.
I found her in the lab with Alexis this morning.
she was doing a blood workup on the baby.
so, you're worried about Alexis?
no. Anne.
she's not in good shape, Tom.
I think it's possible she's suffering from postpartum depression, maybe even psychosis.
she believes the baby is talking to her and standing up and behaving in ways that just aren't possible for a 3-week-old infant.
I, uh, appreciate you letting me know.
Tom. I did all the routine tests on Alexis when she was born.
they were normal. There's nothing wrong with her.
has Anne talked to you about any of this?
where you going?
I'm leaving.
I don't understand.
God!
what is going on with you?!
you know how you accused me of holding something back, keeping secrets from you?
I was right, wasn't I?
those dreams I've been having aren't dreams.
I've been going to see Karen.
she implanted something in me.
she controls me... or part of me.
all I know for sure is that I've been going to see her.
okay.
so...we get it out -- the bug.
it's too late for that, Maggie. - No, it's not too late.
we'll go to the infirmary. - Maggie, would you listen
we'll talk to Anne! - just -- just listen to what I have to say!
I am the President's son.
I have access to information, and Karen wants information.
we have a mole.
do you understand what I'm saying? - Hal, you're not the mole!
and if you think I'm letting you out there where Karen is, you're crazy.
I have to go.
fine.
every relationship I've ever been in has ended just like this.
something happens that I don't like, and my head explodes, and I bail.
but not this time.
I'm not giving up on you, Hal Mason.
I don't care what that bitch has done to you or what she's made you do.
we're gonna undo it, okay?
you hear me?
I'm not gonna let her win.
I'm sorry.
what for? - For being an ass.
this job, it's, like, 25 hours a day, 8 days a week, and I don't think I realized the toll that it was taking on us.
with this invasion hanging over our heads, I've been...
more than preoccupied. I've been neglectful, and I'm sorry.
you knew what you were getting into when you said yes to this job.
Lourdes came to see me.
listen, you don't have to go through this alone, whatever it is.
we're in it together.
I know that I haven't really been doing my part, but that's gonna change.
from now on, I'm gonna be there for you.
you have no idea what you're talking about, Tom.
okay, you're right.
why don't you tell me what's going on with you?
you're not gonna like it.
I'll keep an open mind.
I don't think she's human.
the rebar runs proximately across the middle cerebral artery.
the dark color here is blood because the artery has been ruptured and she's hemorrhaging.
is that why she can't see? - No.
the occipital lobe here controls sight.
and the rebar went through that, ended up over here, missing the temporal lobe, which is in front.
that's why she's still able to talk.
we're not pulling that thing out, are we?
right now, the rebar is the only thing keeping her alive.
it's acting like a cork.
so, as soon as we... - I got it.
the key is the fold.
it's all in the fold.
so, you want to tell me what happened today?
your mom says that you've been talking up a storm and standing around in your crib, staring at her.
what's next, the 100-yard dash?
you know you're not supposed to be doing any of that, right?
see, this is where the wings come into play.
you just fold it over like that...
and pin.
see? It's all in the fold.
I'm not crazy.
I know.
but have you looked at her lately?
I don't mean through a microscope. I mean, have you really looked at her?
she's beautiful.
10 fingers. 10 toes.
no claws. No scales.
she's perfect.
they've taken almost everything from us.
don't let them take her. Don't
don't do that.
I am not crazy, Tom.
you're going through something, though.
I'm not a doctor. I don't know what it is.
dad, sniper's regained consciousness. - Wait for me outside, please.
I love you.
and I'm here.
I'll see you later.
she say anything?
uh, name, rank, serial number, and a few choice words for my spikes.
why were you firing on my soldiers?
what are you doing here? What are you looking for?
Katherine Fisher. First Lieutenant.
serial number 02-- - 022487.
Yeah, I heard you the first time.
unless you want to get out the water board, I don't see her telling us much.
well, I hope it doesn't come to that, Colonel.
figure of speech, sir. Figure of speech.
you hungry?
did you offer her any water?
she hasn't asked for any.
Ben. - Yep.
tell you what.
since you don't feel like talking, how about I guess what I think happened, and if I'm wrong, you can feel free to disagree?
you're wasting your time.
maybe, but I got five minutes.
I think you've been out there checking us out.
maybe for a day, two.
maybe more.
I think you saw us working with Skitters, spiked kids.
I think you saw aliens you hadn't seen before.
and you probably thought that you'd stumbled into an alien compound filled with human collaborators. Am I right?
the world has changed, Lieutenant.
we are no longer fighting the Espheni by ourselves.
the Skitters that you saw are rebels fighting with us.
and the aliens you saw are a race called the Volm, also our allies.
you really want to know what I think? - Yes.
I think the only good alien's a dead alien.
Colonel, who the hell is this bozo?
you best not let your mouth overload your tail there, soldier, or this could go south real quick.
that man is the President of the new United States, and you'd do well to show some respect.
you think something's funny about that?
I work for the President, sir
the real President, Benjamin Hathaway.
who do you think sent me here?
if it is the case, I guarantee you her squad is, hightailing it back to whatever hole the President is hiding in.
they're gonna tell him we're collaborating with the enemy, and he's not gonna look kindly upon us.
unless she's making it all up.
she could be spinning a fairy tale about President Hathaway.
well, if she isn't, they'll be back in force.
if she is, then we need to get to the President, tell him what the hell we're doing here.
professor, we're on high alert, anticipating an Espheni strike any day.
every man, woman, and child who can fire a weapon or fill a sandbag is spoken for.
we can't afford to be sending anybody out on a wild goose chase right now.
we can't afford not to, General.
you really want to be fighting this war on two fronts
against the Espheni and ourselves?
if Benjamin Hathaway is alive, we don't know where he is.
unless we take the gloves off, that sniper's not gonna tell us.
Hey. - Hey.
I thought you might be hungry. And thirsty.
that must've set you back.
I'm sorry about this morning.
I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. I'm sorry.
that's okay.
how you feeling?
I'm fine.
I'm not fine. I don't know.
I mean, looking at her now, she's everything I could've wanted Tom's and my child to be.
But?
but I stopped believing in Santa Claus two years ago.
you want to know what I think?
thank you.
I think for two years, all we did was run.
we survived by doing things we never thought we'd be capable of.
and now that we're settled down in Charleston, it's catching up to us.
we're all suffering on some level.
I just... I can't afford to fall apart right now.
you know? - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I don't have to be back at work until tomorrow.
I can stay here all night if you need me to.
thank you.
wait.
did Tom send you here?
he doesn't even trust me with my own baby.
he trusts you, Anne. - Just leave.
leave, Lourdes! Now! - I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I...
Tom asked me to stay until he got home.
honor TO HIM
how you doing, Bear?
Hi, Dad.
I brought you some hot chocolate.
Mmm, hot. Thank you.
I like this. This is... this is good.
I-I think people are gonna like it, yeah.
if anyone lives to see it.
the Espheni are coming, Dad.
we all know it.
that makes what you're doing here unimportant, a waste of time?
no, sweetheart.
this is...
we're all gonna die.
Yes. Someday. Someday, I surely plan to.
I mean at their hands.
maybe.
but as long as we're here, we can't stop doing what we do, being who we are.
otherwise, we're just already dead -- dead on our feet, and what good is that?
how do you stay so optimistic?
if I'm optimistic, it's because I got something worth dying for.
Hey. - Hey.
I heard about what you did out there.
I'm proud of you.
sometimes the best thing that we can do for people is just to be there for them as a witness...
when they leave.
you could be a real pain in the ass, you know that?
but you could fight like a banshee.
thank you.
nice words, Professor, but as usual, too little too late.
Pope. - That's all right, Dan. Let him speak his mind.
she never should have been out there.
hell, she was dead on her feet long before that shot rang out.
man, you got half my Berserkers working on your top-secret bubblehead project, and the other half are on the frontlines just in case the fishheads get hungry.
there's no rest. There's no explanations.
we don't even know what the hell it is we're helping them build. Do you?
you don't -- you don't care. Not really.
lee's lying in there with a hole in her head not because of them
because of you. Mr. President.
you.
you're right.
Pope, is that you? - It's me.
I'm right here.
Where's the kid?
Where's Matt?
he took a break.
he's coming. He's coming back.
you know his name, huh?
Yeah, sweetheart?
when we get out of here, take me someplace, okay?
sure.
where you want to go?
Disneyland.
Disneyland? - Yeah.
Yeah, we could steal a car.
no, not just any car...
a nice car.
just me, you, and the kid.
I can't go to Disneyland, Craze.
they won't let me in.
why not?
I got into a fistfight with Goofy.
last time I was there. I'm banned for life.
just my luck, huh?
Hal, listen to me.
people died because of the information the mole gave Karen.
the Vice President was murdered.
do you remember killing him?
do you remember telling Karen anything that would've gotten people killed?
does it matter? - Yeah, it matters, because she made you do those things.
whatever it is you did, if anything, you're not responsible for.
tell that to the people who died.
listen to me.
this is treason we're talking about, all right?
murder.
do you have any idea what's gonna happen to you if you turn yourself in?
you have any idea how amped up people are about this?
they'll hang everything on you whether you did it or not.
not even your father's gonna be able to save you.
you better be sure about this, Hal, before you say anything to anybody.
I'm sure.
I pushed the meeting with Adam Nye to tomorrow.
water and Power and the Housing Authority can wait till the end of the week.
and I've set the follow-ups with the V. P. candidates - for first thing in the morning. - No need. I've already made my decision.
who? - You.
me?
wh-- I-I don't know if I can -- but it's not -- I'm not
you'll be fine.
president Clinton once said that there would always be a place in our collective memory for those who've willingly given their lives so that we could live ours.
two years ago on this day, our lives changed forever.
many of us lost our families, our friends, our neighbors, but as I look...
the truth is as I look around here this evening, nothing much has really changed.
we're still fighting, still losing loved ones, still living under fear, still searching for...hope.
in fact, as I look around here this evening, it's really hard to look at what we've built and not compare it to what we've lost.
I lost a friend today.
and her sacrifice is an all-too-familiar reminder that every single day matters.
every single one of us matters.
every single one.
tonight, we will inscribe on the leaves of this tree the names of your loved ones who have fought and fallen, those who have died and deserve our remembrance.
and so, like my friend, they'll live here, on the Liberty Tree, forever.
and though the branches will undoubtedly grow, because the cost of freedom is high, this memorial means that no matter how much time goes by, no matter how hard living gets, we will remember.
we will remember that it's not about how long we live but how we live and what we leave behind.
and we will remember my friend, Lee Tedeschi, and all the others and why they fought...
...and why we do.
take cover! - Everybody, come on!
man your defensive positions!
fire!
Hey, let me fight!
let's go! Let's go!
we're here.
this is where the rebel leader said to meet.
can I ask you a question, Dad?
always.
after we find Anne and Alexis, will we go back to Charleston?
I don't know, Ben.
I'm not sure there's much of a future for us there.
Why? Do you want to?
uh, made some friends there, you know?
people I'll -- people I'll miss.
like Denny?
she won't have a problem with the fact that my sister's a half-alien, but the others?
Lexie will be treated like a freak.
like you were.
I was, uh, old enough to deal with it.
but a small child?
I-I don't want her to have to go through that.
neither do I.
so, uh, if we don't go back, what will we do?
we keep moving. Keep fighting.
honestly, I haven't really thought that far ahead.
first task is to get to Mechanicsville, find Anne and Lexie.
their new leader -- he seems pretty full of himself.
Yeah, he makes me nervous when I'm channeling him.
it's different than Red Eye? -Very. He's more...
aggressive? -Impatient.
completely loyal to the cause, though.
he and the others almost treat Red Eye like a God.
reaching out to humans that took a lot of risk. Took a lot of
they're coming.
who's coming? - Enemy patrol.
they're searching for you. You must divert.
which way are they coming from?
which way are they coming from?
you're probably too young to remember that camping jag mom and dad were on.
talking about every other weekend, we'd head out to the berkshires, set up camp, dad would get to cooking bacon, eggs, biscuits.
I kind of remember that.
yeah? Well, I hate to say it, but we have oatmeal and grits, a little bit of coffee.
food always tastes better when you're starving.
I guess.
it's weird, you know?
what's that, buddy?
it's like the war never happened here.
Yeah, I know. Right?
especially after everything we've been through.
it makes you wonder what would have happened if we had just come up here.
but I suppose dad would have never let me shoot a gun, huh?
that's for sure.
but when we find Anne and Lexie, I don't know.
maybe dad will want to come back here.
or someplace where there aren't any Skitters.
maybe.
they're back.
come on, boys! We got to get going!
Skitters and Mechs on their way!
all right, get that stuff. Let's go. Pack it up.
the good news is business is booming, profits are up.
the bad news is so what?
well, we got more credits than we know what to do with.
that's my whole point, right?
what the hell am I gonna do with all that pieces of paper, right?
get myself a new tube of toothpaste?
Yeah, but someday...
the future's not ours to see, Lyle.
it's carpe diem.
grab what you can and grab it fast.-Yep.
what we need is someone or something to trade with another community or something.
maybe like the one where President Hathaway was.
actually, that's an almost-brilliant idea.
the hell do you think you're doing?
getting ready to tow this...thing.
no, you are not. -No, I am, Pope.
in fact, this whole area is being cleared out.
cleared out, my ass.
on whose orders?
by order of the President of the new United States, Pope.
so I guess it's true what they say, huh?
absolute power corrupts absolutely.
refugees keep pouring in every day.
housing below the city is at maximum capacity.
ms. Peralta wants to make room, and Pope Town, including your bar, is the most logical choice.
it's the worst possible choice, Cap.
people need a place to blow off steam.
you can't keep that kind of pressure building up.
keep your powder dry, Pope.
you're not being closed. You're just being moved.
where? Timbuktu?
listen. If Tom Mason was here, you know it wouldn't
medical evac team needed on the perimeter immediately!
medical evac team needed on the perimeter immediately!
go! Go!
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
get to the perimeter now!
please, hurry.
the President is in need of immediate medical...assistance.
nobody moves... Nobody dies.
Hey. What you got there on the back of your neck?
it's acne.
acne?
drop your weapons! Now!
friend, I always tell my boys it's best to look before leaping.
what do you want with us?
right now, I want you to get off your horses, lay your weapons on the ground.
do it quick!
if we wanted to kill you, you'd be dead half a mile back.
we just want your horses and your supplies, then we'll be on our ways.
y'all just be smart now. Do exactly as you're told.
no one needs to get hurt.
up against the truck.
move! -That's it.
easy, now.
you folks been living out here since the invasion?
we just came from Charleston.
I guess you haven't heard.
heard what?
that there's thousands of survivors, just like you, gathered there.
Why?
we're helping each other.
planting crops. We got livestock.
nobody's going hungry.
even formed a government.
and an army.
army?
who you planning to fight, little man?
the aliens.
is that so?
that is so.
friend, you're out of your ever-loving mind.
Hyah!
Hyah!
what do we do now?
we're gonna go after them, get our stuff back.
damn straight we will. We got to be smart about it.
we got to be fast about it. We got to get to Anne and Lexie.
we attempted to contact your headquarters through the frequency you gave us, Mr. President, but so far have had no luck.
well, keep trying, Colonel. They will answer eventually.
Yes, sir.
in the meantime, all of Charleston is at your disposal.
thank you, Ms. Peralta. Your name sounds familiar.
weren't you in Jim Webb's office?
Yes. I was his chief administrative assistant.
I knew it, yeah.
"Feisty" he called you, as I remember.
he used to say, "you don't want to have Marina barking up your tree."
the senator did have a way with words, sir.
he didn't make it?
no. I'm afraid not.
but you did, Mr. President
twice, and that is nothing short of a miracle.
the miracle is standing right here beside me.
I did nothing more than shield President Hathaway from the impact when the airplane crashed.
how is that possible?
volm bodies are adapted genetically for combat.
and, consequently, we can withstand much greater levels of stress.
Cochise tells me that the Volm weapon is almost complete.
even with the delays, I assure you we will be ready to attack the Espheni defense grid in less than two weeks.
I'm not so sure about that.
what do you mean?
there are some serious unanswered questions.
according to my science advisor, your device will deliver far more power than the weapon you described to us.
that is true.
unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to give you any more information at this time.
as you well know, there have been security leaks within Charleston's command structure.
if you're referring to the Espheni spy, that issue has been resolved.
in what way?
by removing the Espheni probe from Hal Mason.
we no longer have a security leak.
pardon me for saying so, but that is a dangerous supposition.
the Espheni are far too clever to rely on just one strategy.
so the intricacies of our device must remain confidential at this time, Ms. Peralta.
Mr. President -- -The outcome of the war depends on the completion and deployment of that weapon.
there can't be any further delays.
even if we don't know what this thing does?!
Colonel?
well, sir, it's hard to argue against the benefits we've gained by allying ourselves with Cochise and the Volm, but I've always believed that this should be a human-led operation with the Volm providing support.
I agree with Ms. Peralta that less-than-complete disclosure is not in the spirit of true cooperation.
noted. And thank you for your candor.
but the mission must go ahead as scheduled.
and perhaps it would be best if I were to inspect this weapon with my own eyes.
as you wish.
can you take these saddles off, Boo?
it's not a bad haul for half a day's work, huh, Dad?
sorted and shelled in 20 minutes, boys.
Yes, sir.
bet these guys are thirsty.
then fetch them some water, girl.
come on, now, boys. - You know the pump's stuck.
you're the one who stuck it. -Bibs?
that might work.
here.
so, you want to talk about it?
talk about what?
about everything.
I wouldn't know where to start.
you know, when we took your harness off,
I figured I knew what you were going through.
but, quite frankly, I'm a little embarrassed by some of the advice I gave you.
I just can't stop thinking about the fact that there I was, sleeping right next to Maggie every night.
and she stuck with me.
had no idea I had that...thing inside of me for months, and, I mean, there's just no telling what I could have even done to her.
is that why you -- you didn't let her come with us?
we don't know what we're getting into.
you know, I've already put her through enough.
what's up?
they've stopped moving. We're getting closer.
or they've reached their home base.
okay, everybody move as quietly as they can.
come on.
lazy jerks.
don't make a sound, okay? Okay.
marinara sauce with meatballs. Sounds delicious.
don't even try it.
don't move.
drop it!
in your dreams, son!
Hal? -I'm okay.
what did you do that for?
Colonel, this was support to carry fresh troops out, to the perimeter an hour ago.
all of our mechanics called in sick.
and this is the third vehicle to "break down" today.
but it's not just the motor pool.
the same thing happened in the armory.
we've got weapons piling up that need to be repaired, sir.
are you saying there's some kind of organized work slow-down going on around here?
well, I'm not big on conspiracy theories, but Pope has a mighty smug look on his face.
afternoon, Colonel.
what the hell are you up to, Pope?
absolutely nothing, sir.
just having a friendly chat with a couple of citizens here from Charleston, S. C. reminding them they, in fact, do have some rights, if this is still a democracy, as it purports to be.
if we're short vehicles, weapons, and soldiers on the front line when the enemy attacks, we're gonna lose a lot of people.
you really want that on your conscience?
sir, if throwing a wrench into the works improves Ms. Peralta's hearing, then hell yes, I do.
this is no time for shenanigans.
no disrespect, Colonel. This is exactly the right time.
first the Volm -- they turn us into their monkey-boys. Now this?
Colonel, this is a bad road.
I just think it'd be time for a nice... change of pace -- a new vision.
what you're talking about is not only foolish, it's dangerous.
and when Tom comes back
Tom Mason is not coming back, sir.
he's smarter than all of us put together.
he knows when to abandon a sinking ship.
you pull your dogs off this bone now.
truth's a bitch, ain't it, Colonel?
Yes, sir. Truth is one squirrelly bitch.
come on.
help me get his jacket off.
okay. We need to stop the bleeding.
some soap and water, some -- some clean towels.
come on.
this is how you treat people?
you come into my house, you try to kill my brother?
I wouldn't be in your house if you hadn't robbed us.
we're just trying to survive, same as you.
we don't rob people.
you can see we're not exactly living the high life here.
I got kids, same as you.
the aliens kidnapped the rest of my family, and every minute I spend with you is one less minute I spend looking for them.
we've come for what's ours and that's it -- we're gone.
so, where's our stuff?
next to the shed, last I saw.
Matt, go check on our gear and come right back.
sure, Dad.
they expect us to work for them -- with the bubbleheads.
no questions, no -- no complaints.
right? - Yeah.
and the whole time deny us our simple pleasures.
I say until they rescind that order to take what is ours
o confiscate our property -- we don't work for them, and we sure as hell don't fight for them.
Yes!
Pope's right.
Colonel, welcome.
we all need a place to unwind. I recognize that.
and Ms. Peralta recognizes that.
but there is no place in my vision of democracy for wanton disregard of the law...
especially when it threatens the safety of this community and the progress of the war effort.
is that clear?
Pope, you're under arrest.
what charges?
civil disobedience and general unruliness.
you have the authority, sir, but you do not have the right.
drink up and return to your quarters.
starting tomorrow, all shifts on the Volm project will continue uninterrupted.
good night.
how did you find this place?
this farm's been in my family for three generations.
I was born in this house same as my brother, same as all my children.
so you just stayed up here? Even after the invasion?
those things never came up here.
they're not interested in us.
I seen the spaceships, explosions.
I heard the stories.
you think he's gonna make it?
I don't know.
from what I saw, though, -he's a fighter, so -he's got a chance.
you're damn right he's a fighter.
uncle Gil's too mean to die.
what are those things on the back of your neck?
it's a long story.
the aliens put a parasite on my back to control me.
we -- we tried to cut it off, but the pieces are still inside me.
that's nasty.
everything about them is nasty.
they -- they killed a lot of my friends, murdered my mother.
Hey, my mom was murdered, too.
thought you said you only saw the aliens from a distance.
it wasn't aliens. It was people.
after the invasion, a group of men came by.
they said they'd been on the run for a few days.
so we brought them in and fed them.
then they tried to rob us, so...
shot my mom before we could stop them.
you saw her die?
anyway, after that, dad said this is the world we live in now
eat or be eaten.
Charleston's not like that.
people look after each other. You should check it out.
dad would never go for that.
you're not from around here, are you?
you're not from Charleston, neither.
from Boston originally. -Ah. Boston.
we've been fighting them since they arrived -- my boys and I.
I suppose that's a legitimate choice.
we figured our chances were better right here.
sure, so long as there's plenty of victims traveling the road.
which ain't often.
you can't blame a man for trying to keep his family alive, now, can you?
you have managed to do that so far.
something to be said for that.
so far.
it's only a matter of time before the aliens find you.
so we just should follow you to your Shangri-la?
I understand your anger.
if that was my brother laying up there, or one of my sons, I'd be angry, too.
you don't know the first thing about what I'm feeling right now.
mister, you don't know who you're talking to.
those stories you heard are about people like us.
aliens killed my wife.
I think I know a little something about loss.
and regret.
it's with me every morning when I wake up and every night when I close my eyes.
and every hour and every minute in between.
your mountain isn't high enough, and there isn't a hole deep enough.
there is no hiding.
the only chance that you have -- that any of us have is to stand together against them.
dad!
what is it, son?
it's Uncle Gil. He's dying.
my brother is dying.
now you -- you give me a chance to get up there and see him.
dad, we can't trust him.
you gonna let him die without seeing his kin?
what kind of man are you?
you promise you won't try anything?
mister... I give you my word.
Gil, it's Duane. Can you hear me?
you got to fight, brother.
Hey, we're all here -- all of us.
huh? You can hack it.
you just got to hang on, yeah?
okay.
no, don't!
leave the gun on the ground.
leave it down.
finger off the trigger. Finger off the trigger!
hands above your head.
up against the wall, left-hand side, boys.
come on, over there.
up against the wall! Left-hand side!
up against the wall!
you gonna kill my kids? That's who you are?
it's your own damn fault! You had to come after us!
now, if we let them go, they will come back.
your kids are gonna remember this moment for the rest of their lives.
you're gonna turn them into killers?
no.
dad. -Easy, Boo.
it's a harsh world, mister.
my boys and my girl -- they need to get tough to survive.
you don't want to do this. You're not gonna do this!
you shot my brother!
now turn around, face the wall!
Duane, you do not want your kids to watch you stop being human!
put the gun down!
no, sir. I'm gonna shoot you.
now, you say your goodbyes to your kin.
do it now before I send you on your way.
if you're gonna shoot me, you better have the guts to look me in the eye when you do it!
no, we're not monsters.
we're just a family -- a family trying to survive.
No! -It's all right, boo.
Hey!
it's all right. It's all right. It's all right.
Duane, tell Luke to put the gun down!
nobody gets hurt.
no, sir. No, sir.
think about it -- Luke shoots me,
Hal shoots Luke, and Ben shoots you.
and then what? What happens to gil?
what happens to the kids?
take your finger off the trigger, son.
no.
put down your arm, son. Do as your daddy says!
calm down, boy. You done good.
you done good. Shh, shh, shh, shh.
it's all right. It's all right.
impressive.
sufficient for the task at hand.
will your troop ship make it before the Espheni activate their defensive grid?
most unlikely.
then why the hurry?
can't the ship just orbit until we can create a breach in the defensive system?
well, as I have explained, the Espheni grid will create an energy force that will surround the Earth.
and that, by destroying one of the towers, we'll temporarily disrupt the grid, allowing your ship a window for entry.
correct.
but long-term effects of the grid will irradiate the surface of the Earth to such levels that...
...it will destroy all organic life-forms within three months.
that's a nice piece of information to leave out.
and what about the fishheads?
will it cook them, too? Unfortunately not.
the Espheni have biologically engineered themselves and their harnessed slaves to fully withstand the effects of the radiation.
I conveyed all this information to Professor Mason, and he agreed it would only create undue panic and worry to reveal it to the general population.
and I agreed when Cochise told me, as well.
therefore, Ms. Peralta, the excess power Dr. Kadar identified is actually to destroy the grid by feeding an enormous energy burst back into the grid, causing it to overload.
and this couldn't have been explained to me in the first place?
there is great risk involved.
if the grid is not destroyed, feeding that much power back into it could accelerate the process.
life as you know it on this planet will cease to exist.
leave it unlocked.
evening, constable.
got a moment?
well, I'm a little booked up today, but I think I'll make an exception for you.
boy, the state of the union must be in complete turmoil if you've come all the way down here to chat with the likes of me.
when I wanted to throw you out on your ear,
Tom convinced me that having someone who doesn't do the acceptable thing can be essential.
we might be headed for a time when that's true.
and here I figured that you and our ersatz President had it all figured out.
a little trouble in paradise there, Colonel?
I might need your help, Pope.
need my help?
you shut me down.
you put me out of business. You locked me up.
something's going down where none of that's gonna matter, Pope.
you might be right about the Volm.
is that it? That's all you're gonna give me?
till you need to know more.
now get out of here.
no more riling up the civilians.
thought you were locked up.
Yeah, I was liberated.
just when I thought things were looking sunny.
say, listen -- word to the wise, there's some stuff coming down the pike.
what kind of stuff? -Can't exactly say.
meaning you don't know.
no, but the source is unimpeachable.
so why are you telling me?
just figured without the Mason brood around, you might just need a friend.
a friend? I'm fine. Thank you.
then for old time's sake.
there were never any old times, Pope.
not the way I remember it.
the way I remember it is I rescued you from near death.
you kidnapped me and fed me to your gang.
all you had to do was say something, and I would have done something about it.
you knew, you lying bastard, and you did nothing.
just like you lying about your traitorous, eye-wormed boyfriend.
and what did you do?
what did you do, Maggie? You did nothing.
get off your high horse, Maggie. We're no different.
you do what you got to do. At all costs, we survive.
I may have my faults. I got a list of sins 20 miles long.
but I call it the way I see it. And that you can count on.
you are so full of
there will come a time -- sometime soon I suspect when this little pantomime of yours, it's all gonna come to an end.
and when it does...
you're gonna come crawling back to me.
and that's the truth.
Mr. President.
Hey, Doc.
how are you feeling?
Oh, I've been beat up worse by Congress a few times.
I'll live.
I just need to change your I. V. if now's a good time.
you're here.
so, how long have you been a doctor?
well, I was pre-med at Wellesley when the invasion happened, and everything I know now I learned from Dr. Glass since.
Uh-huh. And where's he?
she.
I'm sorry.
this damn war. - Yeah.
you know what I think?
I think Dr. Glass was very lucky to have such an apt pupil.
which makes me lucky, doesn't it?
thank you, sir.
you know, it's young people like you, Doctor, who are gonna rebuild our world when the aliens are gone.
my faith in that is what keeps me going.
thank you, Doctor.
anything else?
no, sir.
Dr. Delgado.
yes?
the President's been shot.
at least he didn't suffer.
first shot killed him instantly.
the shooter was in the room directly below this one.
he had to have used a Volm-modified weapon to shoot through the concrete.
same gun killed Manchester.
the same type, anyway.
so, if you're right, Hal Mason wasn't the mole.
we still have a traitor roaming the streets of Charleston.
we got to find that mole. Focus exclusively on this case.
recruit as many people as you need.
whatever it takes. - Yes, sir.
I want to be briefed at the end of every day on your progress.
let's catch this bastard.
I'll get on the shortwave and notify the President's people.
no. Not until we have more information, Dan.
I don't want a bunch of outsiders pouring into Charleston subjecting our citizens to a witch hunt.
the people of the United States deserve to know that they've lost their leader.
you have your orders.
ma'am.
you have yours, Colonel.
not now, Pope.
probably don't need to point out the obvious, do I, Colonel?
you mean that Ms. Peralta got her comeuppance after the President arrived, and less than 24 hours later, he was assassinated by the mole?
no, you do not need to point that out.
still, it's worth noting that the reins of power have gone right back into her hands, don't you think?
I'm starting to think this Charleston is starting to feel less like a fledgling democracy - and more like a Roman palace. - Then...
I suggest you watch your back, lest you find a dagger in it.
you, too.
once we get clear of this trail, it should be about 15 miles to Mechanicsville, Anne, and Lexie.
and you can bet Karen will be waiting for us.
wouldn't have it any other way.
wait. Mechs. Which way?
there. All right, off the trail.
I don't see anything. You sure -- oh, no. Wait.
Mega-Mechs.
I got them. There's two of them.
right down there.
probably some Skitters, too.
how many?
maybe about half a dozen.
scouting in front of the main body.
it's probably the same ones those rebels were telling us about. - Yeah.
dad, they're headed right for the Picketts.
they'll never stand a chance. That's tough luck.
so, we're just gonna turn our backs, ride off, and leave them to the aliens?
those people were gonna shoot us.
Yeah, but they didn't.
I'm not sure they were going to.
dad, what about Anne and Lexie?
we already lost a lot of time -- too much time.
I know. But if all we care about is our own family, then we're no better than them.
we're with you, Dad. -Yeah.
not this time.
listen, Anne and Lexie -- that's your job.
you guys get to Mechanicsville. Don't stop for anything.
recon the situation. I'll meet you there.
dad?
I need you to do this for me, buddy.
can you do it?
Yes, Dad.
okay. Good luck.
is anybody here?
all right, bring it, you bastards!

he was my friend, okay?
sure, he was a jerk, but deep down...
all I'm saying is, you're gonna find him, right?
the...the guy who did it.
we'll find him.
how's your head, then?
Oh, yeah, it's okay. Aches still, but...
you try that hot dish?
Oh, yeah. Real good.
Yeah.
so, you know, Kitty and I were talking, and we think you should move in here for a while.
just stay with us, you know, until you get the house cleaned up or sold.
why the heck would I sell the house?
Oh.
I'm not saying you have to go that way.
just, you know, stay a few days until we get it cleaned up.
cops left a real mess.
Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm.
Yeah, the crime scene and all, really turned the place upside down.
looking for clues, I suppose.
1961. 9. 28 - 2006. 1. 20
how are you doing? All right?
thank you. - Okay.
you don't have to do that.
they're piling up.
Vern told me this story once.
when he was a rookie, had a boss couldn't tell his shoe from his foot.
got killed by a hail stone.
just standing in the parking lot of the Dairy Queen, having a milkshake, hail stone comes down, size of a softball, crushes his skull.
what flavor?
strawberry, I think.
I was thinking about when my dad got shot.
traffic stop, yeah?
Yeah. Hmm.
he pulled over the fellas that robbed Callihans and stole the snow plow.
they came to tell me at school.
I was in algebra.
and he's okay, you know?
got the limp, of course, but they caught the guys, so...
the little one, he even got probation.
convinced the jury it was a stockholm syndrome deal, you know.
okay, we got now a list of who'll come by when and do what.
this is on the due date, you know.
get you to the hospital, bring you home, so you're covered.
say, Bill, I was thinking, we should talk to Lester Nygaard first thing.
Lester? Well, he already made a statement back at the hospital.
Yeah, I know, I read it, but see, thing is,
Vern was on his way to Lester's house to talk to him about Hess' murder, you know, how possibly Lester was involved.
went to high school with Lester.
had to dissect a mouse in Mrs. Knutson's class, and poor Lester fainted.
Oh. Yeah, okay, but...
girl had her monthly once in gym class, there goes Lester, fainting again.
right, so he doesn't like blood, but still...
Plus, this Hess murder, got to believe that's about the cutthroat world of regional trucking.
Yeah.
so it's just coincidence, you're saying?
hess gets killed, and then the massacre at Lester's house the next day?
exactly.
see, I'm thinking this is home invasion.
you know, it's a drifter or some such.
drug related maybe, but not, you know, Lester Nygaard.
am I right, Ida?
you're not not right.
but on these high-profile deals, Bill, it never hurts to talk to the eyewitnesses yourself.
take control of the facts.
that's what Vern always used to say.
okay. Okay, good.
we go see Lester, but I do the talking.
Heya, Lester.
Mr. Nygaard, we got some questions we'd like...
this is Molly. - Deputy Solverson.
sure, nice to meet ya.
like I was saying, we got some questions, so...
how you holding up, Lester? How's the head?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it hurts.
I got a little...
double vision still.
jeez, well, you know, if now's not a good time...
no, I was just about to...
I want to help, you know, it's just, there's so much work to do.
Yeah, sure, it'll only take a second.
all I got's grape juice. Hope that's okay.
pearl says it reminds her of being a kid.
sad.
remember that gum?
that grape gum that they had when we were kids?
heck... What was that called?
uh, so we got your statement from the hospital.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I was real thorough with those fellas.
I mean, what I could remember. Doctor says I got a concussion.
says if I was hit any harder, my brain could've swole up and leaked right out my ears.
thank gosh that didn't happen.
in your statement, you said that you came home and found your wife, that... that she was already dead.
Uh-huh, downstairs, yeah. I heard the washer going...
spin cycle, and I...
well, you know, she was on the floor, you know, and there was a lot of...
I never even heard the guy. Uh, just one minute, I'm...
uh, looking at her, and the next...
so, uh, you don't remember Chief Thurman coming to the house, then?
Oh, no. No, I feel sick about that, really.
I guess he saw the guy breaking in.
uh, no, Mr. Nygaard.
chief Thurman came to talk to you about a man you may have met in the emergency room the day previous.
hmm, you don't say?
look, Lester...
if this is too hard for you, - you can just give us the bare bones... - We got a witness says that, uh, she saw you and this other fella arguing about Sam Hess.
who?
you remember Sam...he used to beat you up in high school.
what?
Oh, yeah, Sam had a thing for ol' Lester here.
used to chase him around the schoolyard till one or the other ran out of gas.
you remember... Big kid.
what was that name he called you?
uh, Lester Nig... - Oh, yeah. Yeah, Sam.
Yeah.
that was a long time ago.
but you were talking about him in the emergency room, so what's the story there?
well, I, uh...
hmm, it's real fuzzy, but I might have said, "My face is a mess."
"mess" sounds like "Hess." Probably, your...
the witness just misheard.
Yeah, that's possible.
can you describe the fella?
height, eye color that kind of thing?
you know, the last few days, they're real fuzzy.
reason we asks is, we got an operating theory, okay?
this being the work of a drifter, or drifters, possibly drug-related.
see, I'm thinking this fella you met at the hospital, - maybe he followed you home. - That's not...
we don't both share that theory.
I-I'm a little, uh, scrambled right now.
I-I got a concussion. I'm not sure if I said that.
so, yeah, thi-things...
things are kind of fuzzy.
well, you know what?
I'm satisfied.
I've actually...I got a few more quest...
Yeah, thanks for the grape juice, Lester.
takes me back, I tell ya.
and I'm gonna look up the name of that gum when I get home.
Bubba Bubba, yeah. Yeah, Hubba Bubba.
we used to crack up about that.
do you remember Hubba Hubba? - No.
if you need anything, Lester, you give us a call, 'cause I'll tell you what, this is a tragedy.
straight-up, dyed-in-the-wool tragedy.
she was a good woman, you know.
good wife.
I-I just keep asking myself, "Who could've done a thing like this"?
good morning, young fella.
you have a package for me.
all righty, what's your name?
Why?
so I can find the package.
I'm sorry?
the package is addressed to "Duluth."
that's a city. I need your name.
I told you my name.
your name's "Duluth"?
well, I'll need to see some I. D.
no.
what?
you heard me.
I can't give you your mail if you don't show I. D.
sure, you can.
all you gotta do is look through those packages over there, find the one addressed to "Duluth," and then hand it to me.
look, son, we're in Duluth, so, technically, all the mail is addressed to "Duluth."
am I gonna need to come back there and find it myself?
sir?
o-okay.
this is highly irregular.
no, highly irregular is the time I found a human foot in a toaster oven.
this is just odd.
I'm a minister, apparently.
sir?
you have a blessed day.
missed a spot.
you're looking at the supermarket king of Minnesota, La Mercado Rey.
29 markets in 15 counties, and it all started right here in this office.
next quarter, we're expanding into Wisconsin and the Dakotas.
by this time next year, rule the whole goddamn midwest.
you see my mangos?
straight from Ecuador, kiwis too.
that's what makes my stores so goddamn superior.
I got mangos in goddamn January.
and the back of a 90-year-old woman.
God damn it.
who's the fire hydrant?
head of security.
you an oilers fan?
Wally here is 1992 Farm League M.V.P.
knocked 138 heads career-wise, ain't that right, Wally?
our mutual friend said something about a blackmail letter.
found this on my windshield last week.
what does this mean, "I know about the money"?
what it means don't matter.
it's blackmail.
I didn't bring you here for what it means.
I brought you here to make it stop.
Semenchko said, "Don't do it." He said, "Let me handle it."
but you don't get to be La Mercado Rey without knowing when to delegate, comprende?
it's a pretty specific number, $43, 613.
hell, maybe he wants to pay off his student loans, I don't know.
what matters is, can you find the guy?
Hey, dad. Got a good one for ya.
Oh, sorry.
don't you know closed door means "Keep out," boy?
or at least knock, for shit's sake?
you'll like this.
what's a karate expert's favorite beverage?
Kara-tea. Get it?
Kara-tea.
it's--it's tea.
son, get the hell out.
nice to meet ya.
look, I can find the guy.
the question is, what do you want done with him once he's found?
send him packing.
isn't that what they say?
who says that?
in the movies.
I don't watch movies.
you don't watch movies.
look, this ain't complicated.
you don't get to be the supermarket king of Minnesota without making a few enemies, all right?
start with my damn wife.
you think your wife's blackmailing you?
you ever nail a greek woman?
after 40, their pussies grow teeth.
and she ain't my wife, she's my soon-to-be ex-wife, and she is suing me for 50%.
except now I'm starting to think maybe 50% ain't enough for her.
this is kind of embarrassing, but, uh...
would you sign a copy of my book?
I'd be delighted.
you--you want something personal?
Yeah, could you put "To Frank Peterson, thanks for nailing my blackmailer."
I'm just kidding. Anything you want. You're the writer.
in addition to the victims in the basement
that's Nygaard, Mr. And Mrs.
we're hearing the chief of police was shotgunned in the foyer.
that means "Entryway."
no description yet of the suspect or suspects, but I told the new chief over in Bemidji we'd be on high alert for anything that connects.
that means suspicious persons or jailhouse snitches saying they know a thing.
okay, let's get to it.
animal-control guy called in sick again--you're on duty.
Yes, sir.
I got "Aurora borealis." What about you? Over.
I just put "Northern lights." Over.
my dad's home with dinner. Over.
what's it tonight? Over.
looks like burgers. Over.
and chicken nuggets.
and chicken nuggets. Over and out.
did you get the dipping sauces?
extra, even.
good day?
Yeah.
we, uh-- we had an assembly, and the principal talked about bullying and how bullying was wrong, and if we saw somebody getting bullied, we should say something or stop it, and I raised my hand, and I asked what you're supposed to do if the bully is, like, a lot bigger than you are or has a knife or something.
and what did he say?
that if the bully has a knife, then you should tell a grown-up.
well, that's good advice.
Yeah, but what if there's no time? I mean, you're the police.
if you saw somebody doing something, you'd stop 'em, right?
well, you know, sometimes there's more than one right thing.
what does that mean?
it means...
I got you, and I am responsible for you, and sometimes I might be in a situation where
and this hasn't happened, and it won't
but a situation where if I try to stop a guy from doing a bad thing,
I could get hurt.
or worse.
and then who would take care of you?
but it's your job.
well, I got two jobs, and the first, the most important, is being your dad.
well, if I saw somebody doing something, I would stop 'em.
I believe you would.
every cooperation, obviously.
if you want girl, you want drug, just ask.
you know who we are.
I told the police,
I couldn't see the guy on account of the blood being in my eyes.
we got a description of a man.
5'10," brown hair, big bruise on the forehead.
does it ring a bell at all?
could be Lenny.
who's Lenny?
comes in here a lot.
drink pretty heavy.
I heard him say a few things over the years about guys like Hess.
money in the pocket, think they're tough shit.
that's him at the bar, with the band-aid on his head.
well, the Russians, they used to send dogs up into space, which is stupid, because what's a dog gonna do in space?
at least with a monkey, they can operate the, uh
the equipment or something.
Hi. My friend would like an orange soda, and I'll have just a cup of hot water with lemon.
what are you supposed to be, some kind of circus act?
Oh, my friend was wondering, how'd you hurt your head?
Oh, is your friend looking for a date?
cause you know this is a place for dicks who like pussies, not pussies who like dick.
no, seriously, h-h-how'd you hurt your head?
screw.
I ain't afraid of a dink and a lepton.
you like playing with knives?
Oh, you keep talking, big boy, you're gonna find out.
that the guy?
can you take off the tape maybe?
God damn you little bastards! I'll kill the lot of you!
Hey, now, look, okay?
I'm sorry for what I said to you before about the dink and the lepton.
I don't think it's him.
delicious. Just a few more.
What'd you say your name was again, handsome?
Frank Peterson, ma'am.
I work for Mike, your divorce attorney.
Oh. Charmed, I'm sure.
Oh, sorry. Just bronzed.
he's a pig. You smelled his hands?
have I smelled your husband's hands?
they smell like feet.
your ass looks amazing, darling. Keep it up.
so, anyway, I've been tasked to put together a complete record of your husband's assets.
we want to get you the biggest divorce settlement possible.
now, I've got your husband's net worth estimated at $10 million.
more.
$15?
okay, sweetie, let's do a cool down, yeah? Five minutes. There you go.
ma'am, can you confirm that your husband started his first grocery with a loan from his uncle, like it says in the book?
that's the story.
but you don't believe it?
stavros had two uncles.
one of 'em was a drunk who lived in a barn, and the other died in a fishing accident when he was ten.
so where did the money come from?
Hey, ma.
Oh, yeah, from the store.
Hey, I got one for you.
what kind of bone will a dog never eat?
chicken?
a trombone.
Oh, yeah!
that's a good one. A trombone.
my dad'll like that one.
your dad, your dad.
your dad's screwing us, mister.
mommy.
what? I'm just being honest.
he's a hard-on, your father, and you're too trusting.
well, he's my dad, and you're my mom, and everything's gonna work out, okay?
aren't they just the sweetest pair?
Yeah, I-it's me. It's Lester.
uh, she's, uh...my wi-- my wife, she's, uh, aw, hell, um...
I think I, uh...
she's in the basement dead and, uh...Look.
I'm freaking out here. I don't know what to do.
Yeah, yeah, I-it's me. It's Lester.
uh, she's, uh...my wi-- my wife, she's, uh, aw, hell, um...
I think I, uh...
she's in the basement dead and, uh...Look.
I'm freaking out here. I don't know what to do.
Lester, have you been a bad boy?
jeez
Oh! Sorry. Just bronzed.
the hammer and, uh... look
can you come over? I'm on Willow Creek Drive. Number 613.
please! Please?
sure, Lester. I'll be right there.
this place is a shithole.
okay, nut sack, here's the drill
you're gonna pack up your shit and blow.
I'll tell Stavros you couldn't find the guy, and in return, I won't bust your head.
you hearing me, asswipe?
I did some digging on you, made some calls, you get me?
and we don't need you and your big-city connections coming here and showing us what time it is.
I'm the guy.
you understand? Me.
20 years I worked for the king.
you know what that makes me? The goddamn prime minister.
so give me the letter, pack up your shit, and
what the hell you doing?
that's disgusting.
okay, slick, I got your number.
I'm on to ya.
just remember, you were warned.
Semenchko warned you.
uh, hey, Molly.
Yeah, chief?
so just want to make sure we're on the same page about everything.
I want you to center it.
same page about what?
just... about Lester and the case, you know.
just want to make sure you know to focus on the break-in angle.
maybe call some other town, see if they had a similar problem.
no, higher.
similar to three murders, including the police chief?
not, you know, literally.
just ruffians and the like.
right there, perfect.
look, chief, I know you don't think Lester
maybe call the staties, you know?
see if they effected any car stops.
suspicious types where the driver had a head wound, and the like.
Yeah. Yeah, but I think
just... leave poor Lester alone, will ya?
you'll be in Gordo's room.
he's on the sofa, which is-- don't worry.
his dad built him a fort. He loves it.
baby, it's cold outside!
but here at Phoenix farms, it's always summer.
real good peas, hon.
Yeah, mom, real good.
how's your dinner there, Lester?
Oh, yeah. Real good.
I was thinking of going hunting this weekend.
told Gordo I would take him shooting.
you interested?
now, hon, I don't think your brother wants to be around all that guns and violence, not after what happened.
Oh, shot, I'm sorry. - No, no, - it's fine. - I can be a real ass sometimes.
language. - No, no, no, I-- it sounds
you know, bag a deer or something.
so I've been thinking, maybe I should sell the place, you know?
get a-- what do you call it, a fresh start?
yeah?
that's great.
I'll call Jimmy.
it's a fine market right now he says-- real good.
it is the right choice, sweetie.
too many bad memories in that old house.
both Chaz and me think so.
Oh, jeez!
Oh, I am so sorry.
it's okay.
I'm sorry. - It's fine.
Hi.
what can I do for you, son?
well, I got a
I need something for a wound, I guess you'd call it.
are we talking pain pill or something more topical?
it's--I guess something to keep it from getting infected.
okay. That'd be an anti-bacterial.
all right. - I got some in the back.
Mr. Nygaard?
yeah? Ooh, hiya.
Hi. Deputy Solverson again. I just have a few more questions.
is now a good time?
n-not really. I'm kind of in the middle of
sure, yeah, no, I understand. Yeah, it won't take a second.
um, so, listen, going back to the emergency room,
that first visit, that was for a broken nose, is that right?
shoot. I-I just remembered.
um, sir
you know, I got to be honest, I-I-I'm starting to feel a little harassed here.
now, that's not-- - Sir, your unguent!
sir!
I think he means you.
you know, you're asking about a fella that I might've talked to at the hospital when you should be out there looking for the animal that killed my wife.
with all respect, sir, Your wife's not the only victim here.
a friend of mine was killed, plus, you know, Sam Hess.
Yeah--I told you, I haven't seen Sam since high school.
I'm not sure this is your car, Mr. Nygaard.
what?
Oh, no, I-it's-- it's my wife's.
mine's in the shop.
well, sir, it's just--it's hard to believe is all, you know?
I mean, you're saying this is all some big coincidence,
you know, you knowing Sam and all.
and it's a quiet town, and suddenly, we got four victims in 24 hours, yourself included.
and then there's this witness saying that you were talking about sam hess the day he died, and, you know, then it turns out you and he had differences in the past, so...
you know, all I'm saying is, just...
help me understand what happened.
look, I answered all your-- just ask Bill, huh?
your boss, he said he was satisfied.
and I-I got-- look at me.
my wife...
is dead, and you're harassing me.
I'm not harassing you, sir.
talk to Bill!
he'll tell you, this--this was a break-in.
you're wasting time talking to me.
watch your feet, now.
so how's it going?
well, it turns out Lester and Hess went to high school together and Hess used to beat him up.
a learned detective might consider that a clue.
Yeah, that's what I said, but Bill's a big believer in coincidence, apparently.
well, what he lacks in common sense, he makes up in self-esteem.
Yeah.
bill have a theory?
Oh, yeah, he says that it was a spree, you know?
a drifter or "Gang of drifters."
you know, like it's 1942.
like, uh, drifters are a national threat--hobos.
well, he's chief now, so he sets the agenda, same as always.
Yeah, I know, it's just
I mean, you know, here we get this car crash with this dead man in frozen panties nearby, and the driver has a head injury and maybe went to the emergency room where he talked to Lester about Sam Hess, and then within 24 hours, Hess is dead, and then there's the fracas with, you know, Lester's wife and Vern.
not sure if you remember, but when you were five, they had to put you under anesthesia to fix your teeth.
gave you that mask.
gas that smelled like tutti frutti. - Yeah.
my soft little girl in a hard world of drills and needles.
I'm 31, dad. I carry a gun.
I know.
but it's relative, you know?
there's the kind of things a schoolteacher gets exposed to--truancy and the like
and then there's the stuff a cop sees murder and violence and general scofflawery...
and then there's the kind of deal you're looking at now.
which is?
which is, if I'm right...
savagery, pure and simple.
slaughter, hatred, devils with dead eyes and shark smiles, and...
one day, you're gonna get married...
and have kids, and when you look at them, their faces, you need to see what's good in the world, 'cause if you don't, how you gonna live?
you talk a lot, you know that?
it's always been a problem.
Lou. - Chief.
Molly could I have a word?
Yeah, sure.
pull up a chair. You want some coffee or
Yeah, no, uh...
Lester Nygaard called me, yeah, and he's super upset.
well, yeah, you know, I thought he might do that.
Yeah, we talked about this and all, and I thought we were-- I thought I was clear that we were gonna focus on the drifter angle and not, you know, harass the victim.
well, I'm not, you know,
I didn't harass him.
I just--I got questions, you know.
Yeah, well, I'm the chief now, and I got to everyone's got to line up behind me, you know, toe the line.
sure, yeah. Yeah, I know.
Yeah, we talked about this, and now I got to take you off the case.
well, we all know how you felt about Vern.
I mean, heck, who didn't? But...
maybe it's best if you just
it--and this could be good for you career-wise, because, uh, I'm gonna make you head of inquiry on that frozen fella, the naked one.
Yeah, I'll make you lead on that.
bill, Listen, I-- - Yeah!
so that's my decision.
take care.
well, okay, then.
see you for dinner. - Yup.

learn it. Know it. Live it.
whoa. - He's the full hot orator.
Linda, did I show you this? He gave me his card.
Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.
maybe we should get a frame for this, and put it up on the wall.
Linda, you're the one who told me I was gonna get a boyfriend at the mall.
do you think he'll call this week? - Why don't you call him?
I can't. - You can. Guys love that sort of thing.
Really? - Yes!
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're 15 years old.
I did it when I was 13. It's no huge thing. It's just sex.
he was hot, wasn't he? - If I didn't have a fiance in Chicago, I'd go for it.
Hey, how you doin'? Welcome to Ridgemont.
will it look okay?
well, she was an American girl Raised on promises - Do you know where U. S. History is? - Down the hall and turn left.
somewhere else. She was an American girl.
Hi, Bradley.
grown up. Lookin' good.
another year joined at the lips.
Hi, Brad! - Denise. I'd make you see God.
Brad!
big Cruising Vessel! - Bradley!
thank you.
six more payments, gentlemen, and this beautiful...
blue, four-door, luxury sedan is all mine!
I'll give you four tickets in the fifth row...
for the low price of $140.
see that car? Some alumni gave Jefferson that car... for playing football when he was a sophomore.
helped him pick it out. - Slick car.
we go way back, you know.
Hey, Charles, how you doin', buddy? Car looks great. I mean really terrific.
you're really keeping it up wonderfully.
don't fuck with it!
shit! That's my man.
Brad?
Arnold! What's happening? - Can I talk to you a minute?
sure, man.
I really hate Bronco Burger.
ever since they started with the chicken nuggets, everything went downhill.
you have to fry all their greasy food, and you have to polish things.
and the manager's an asshole. I was just wondering...
Arnold, do you want to work at All-American Burger?
Yeah, well, um...
I can probably get you in. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
all right! - Okay.
wait. Did you hear the bell ring?
what bell? - We're here.
Aloha.
my name is Mr. Hand.
I have but one question for you.
can you attend my class?
it is for your own good. And if you can't make it, I can make you.
we have a 20-question quiz every Friday.
your grade is the average of all your quizzes, plus the midterm and final which counts for one-third.
got it?
also...
there will be no eating. E-A-T-l-N-G.
no eating in this class!
you get used to doing your own business on your own time.
that's one demand I make.
just like you wouldn't want me to come to your house...
and discuss U. S. History on your time, understand? - Yes, sir.
this guy's been stoned since the third grade.
yes? - Yeah, I'm registered in this class.
what class? - This is U. S. History.
I see the globe right there. - Really?
Hey. May I come in?
Oh, please!
I get so lonely when I hear that third attendance bell ring...
and all my kids are not here.
sorry, I'm late. It's just like this new schedule's totally confusing.
I know that dude!
Mr. Spicoli.
that's the name they gave me.
you're ripping my card! - Yes.
Hey, bud, what's your problem?
no problem at all.
I think you know where the front office is.
you dick!
I have taken the time to print up a complete schedule...
of class quizzes and the chapters they cover.
please pass them to the desk behind you.
back, back, back.
did you hear about this surfer guy who pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning?
Oh, no! He just called him a dick.
a dick? Oh, God. People exaggerate so much here.
Linda, that girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
I know. Wait. There are three girls at Ridgemont...
who have cultivated the Pat Benatar look.
Chanel Semlar,
Mary Ann Zlotnick in the red tights.
do you think guys find that more attractive?
Stacy, please, give me a break! You are so much prettier!
Yeah, I know, but do you think they'd be better in bed?
what do you mean? You either do it or you don't.
no. There are like... variables that I might not be good at.
like what variables? - Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
what's the big deal?
I never did it. - You've never given a blow job?
never? Stace, there's nothing to it. It's so easy.
check it out.
relax your throat muscles.
don't bite.
and slide it in.
try it again.
good. Push it slowly in and out. You got it.
okay.
can I ask you something and you promise not to laugh? - Sure.
okay. When a guy has an orgasm, how much comes out?
a quart or so.
no, I'm just kidding.
just practice.
I'm not going to a morgue. I'll get my mom to write a note.
nobody's getting me into a room with a bunch of dead guys.
you have to go. I hear it's part of the final.
I hear it's really disgusting. Do you know what they do?
have you heard? - What?
the bodies are dissected and Mr. Vargas...
pulls out parts of the dead body and holds them up.
you mean, he reaches in and pulls this stuff out?
like stomach and tumors or something? - Yeah, stomach, tumors, entrails.
good day, everyone. My name is Mr. Vargas.
look. I'm a little slow today.
I just switched to Sanka, so have a heart.
all right, now.
the World of Life. That is the name of the textbook we will be using.
I'm in love.
see the mustache comin' in, Rat?
you can almost cross it out.
I'm in love. - You are a wuss. Part wimp, part pussy.
what do you mean wuss? This girl is my... exact type.
Where'd you see her? - In my biology class.
did you get her number? - No.
did you get her name? - No! No! It's too soon.
it's never too soon, Rat.
a girl decides how far she's gonna let you go in the first five minutes.
what am I supposed to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class...
and say, "Hello. I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me"?
I would.
I can see it all now. This is gonna be just like last summer.
you fell in love with that girl at the Fotomat.
you bought $40 worth of fuckin' film, and you never even talked to her.
you don't even own a camera!
you tell me, Mike. What should I do?
this is what you do.
start from the minute you walk into biology.
I mean, don't just walk in. Move across the room.
and you don't talk to her.
you use your face. You use your body.
use everything.
that's what I do.
I mean, I just send out this vibe...
and I have personally found that women do respond.
I mean, something happens.
naturally something happens.
you put the vibe out to 30 million chicks, something is gonna happen.
that's the idea, Rat. That's the attitude.
the attitude? - Yeah.
the attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays or prays.
whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'.
now, when you got that... then you have the attitude.
good night, Stacy. - Good night, Mom.
just look at that girl with the lights coming up in her eyes. She's got to be somebody's baby. She must be somebody's baby - You look beautiful. - Thanks. So do you.
where do you feel like going?
I don't know.
how 'bout The Point? - Okay.
all right! The Point it is.
she's got to be somebody's baby. She's so fine. She's probably somebody's only light. Gonna shine tonight. Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight. She's gonna be somebody's only light. Gonna shine tonight Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight.
that's a really nice jacket.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
it's warm. - Yeah, it is. It's really warm.
I wonder how long it will last.
so...
am I gonna get to first base?
are you really 19? - Yeah, yeah, I am. I'm really 19.
she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight. I try to shut my eyes but I can't get her out of my sight. I know I'm gonna know it but I gotta get over my fright. I'm just gonna walk up to her. I'm gonna talk to her tonight. Gonna shine tonight. Make her mine tonight?
Yeah, Gonna shine tonight Make her mine tonight.
so tell me, do you like Ron?
I like Ron, but it hurt so bad.
don't worry. Keep doing it. It gets a lot better. I swear.
it better.
raised on the radio. Just an all-American boy. I got my favorite toy. I was raised on the radio. Yeah, I was raised on the radio. Remembering when times were bad. Love is all we need and love was all we had - Mom says to clean the pool. - Why can't you do it?
your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
your friends use the pool too. - I take out the garbage!
Brad!
Brad, have Mom and Dad seen these? - They're not home yet.
Brad? - What?
what would you say if I asked you to put these...
in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them?
I'd say, "Who the hell is Ron Johnson?" - Please.
thank you very much.
Lisa's great! - Yeah.
I don't understand why you want to break up with a girl like that.
me and Lisa have been going together for two years. I love her and all.
I mean, she's great in bed.
it's just that... I'm a single, successful guy.
and this is my last year in school. This could be the best year of my life!
I just feel like I need my freedom now, you know?
okay, here's your preparation stuff.
you got your sliced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, secret sauce.
what's the secret sauce? - Thousand Island dressing.
what's the secret sauce at Bronco Burger?
ketchup and mayonnaise. - Gotcha.
order for you, Bradley.
were those flowers really for me? - Of course!
how much did they cost? - Don't worry about it.
want to go to The Point tonight?
what's there to do at The Point?
what do you mean? We've been going out together for two years.
I don't want to have to use sex as a tool, Brad.
tool? Tool for what? We've been going together for two years!
I don't want to talk about it here. - I wanna talk about it!
Brad? - Lisa!
Brad!
you gotta flip 'em, or they'll burn. Great.
three weeks we've been talking about the Platt Amendment.
what are you people, on dope?
a piece of legislation was introduced into Congress by Senator John Platt.
it was passed in 1906.
this amendment to our Constitution...
has a profound impact upon all of our...
where is Jeff Spicoli? I saw him earlier today near the first floor bathrooms.
is he still on campus? Anyone? Yes, Desmond?
I saw him by the food machines.
how long ago? - Right before class.
okay. Bring him in.
what is this fascination with truancy?
what is it that gets inside your heads?
there are some teachers in this school who look the other way at truants.
it's a little game that you both play.
they pretend they don't see you. You pretend you don't ditch.
now, who pays the price later? You!
wait a minute. There's no birthday party for me here!
Hola, Mr. Hand.
what's the reason for your truancy?
just couldn't make it on time.
you mean, you couldn't or you wouldn't?
it was like a full crowd scene at the food lines.
food will be eaten on your time.
why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli?
why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
I don't know.
I like that.
I don't know." That's nice!
Mr. Hand, will I pass this class?
gee, Mr. Spicoli, I don't know!
that's nice. I really like that. You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm going to leave your words on this board for all my classes to enjoy.
giving you full credit, of course, Mr. Spicoli!
all right.
sleigh bells ring are you listening - Mommy! - In the lane - Oh, no! - Snow is glistening. A beautiful sight. We're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland.
how fucking long do I have to wait?
Christmas sucks. I hate it.
you gotta get used to working holidays. People are always screaming.
I have to quit this job. I'm gonna get so fat...
no one's gonna want to take me out. - Ron hasn't called, huh?
not since November. - What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman.
What'd you wanna do, marry him? Have kids with him?
have this guy come home 50 years old and bald?
and have that little Pacific Stereo sign on? Come on, Stace.
Hey, it's his loss.
got any Blue Oyster Cult?
no, I don't have any Blue Oyster Cult.
I ate 34 pairs last time. Where were you?
I was that close to working at 7-Eleven, you know.
what?
all right! Play me? - Totally.
you got quarters?
when are those Earth, Wind and Fire tickets comin' in?
earth, Wind and Fire? Geez, I haven't heard anything.
the minute I do, I'll let you know.
I'm plannin' on taking my little brother over here.
is that your little brother? He's a good-lookin' kid.
great. Charles Jefferson...
for Earth, Wind and Fire and little brother.
I'll let you know when they come around, okay?
Wow! Does he really live here? I thought he just flew in for games.
shit! He knows where to come when he wants some tickets.
go on. Get outta here. You're messing up my business.
come on, Rat. Let's go get you a woman.
Wow.
you ready for your moment of truth?
Damone, I noticed I was starting to get a pimple this morning...
rat, the shyness routine is really starting to aggravate me.
I mean, who is she, anyway? She's a waitress in a pizza parlor.
look at her. Look at you. A member of the Honor Roll.
assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.
rat, if this girl can't smell your qualifications, then who needs her, right?
right. - All right. How do you feel?
I feel good. - Do ya? All right.
now stop fucking around and go get her.
Hey, Rat, you gotta ace that jacket.
yeah? - Yeah. All right, that's cool.
you look good. All right? Go get her.
$1. 10, and you get five cents back.
Thanks.
Hi! Don't I know you from biology class? - Yeah!
what can I do for you? - I had a couple of questions. I was curious.
what do you do with the jackets people leave here?
we keep 'em. - You keep 'em?
in case they come back. You can look through it if you want.
no, that's cool. It would take too long to look through all that.
I'll pick up a new one.
what was your other question?
Oh, my other question is...
can I have your phone number so I can ask you out sometime?
do you have a pen? This one's out of ink. - Yeah.
Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy. My name is Mark Ratner.
I've gotta go.
Lisa, I have something to tell you.
look, I'm a senior now.
I'm a single, successful guy.
and I've got to be fair to myself.
Lisa... I think I need my freedom.
Oh, don't do that.
please, please don't do that. - Brad!
can you cover me on register two? - Okay.
may I help you? - Ah, yes.
this is not the best breakfast I ever ate and...
I'd like my money back. - Okay. I believe you have to fill out a form.
no. I'd like my money back now.
I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way. I have to fill out a form.
well, you ate most of it already so...
see that sign? It says "100% guaranteed.
you know what the meaning of guarantee is? Did they teach you that here?
sir, if you'd just wait a minute.
look. Just put your little hand in the cash register...
and give me my $2. 75 back, please, Brad.
sir, if you'd just give me a minute. I'll find the forms. I'll take care of everything.
I don't have a minute. You've made me late enough.
I am so tired of dealing with incompetence.
it says 100% guaranteed, you moron!
mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Ah, is there a problem here? Can I help you, sir?
you bet you have a problem. Your employee used profanity and threatened me with violence.
I'm surprised. I eat here all the time and usually have good service.
all I wanted was my money back on this breakfast. It was a little under-cooked.
and he threatens me with violence. I'm gonna call your super...
I can take care of it.
Mr. Hamilton, did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
uh... he insulted me first. He called me a moron, Dennis.
answer me! Did you threaten this customer or use profanity?
Yes. - You're fired.
I'm very sorry, sir. I'll refund your money right now.
I hope you won't hold this against us.
you know how these young kids are these days.
here we are. Perhaps another breakfast?
I hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold!
the world's finest surfers showed up today to do battle...
with what's turned out to be the biggest waves to hit this coast since 1946.
hello. I'm Stu Nahan, and I'd like you to meet this young man.
his name, Jeff Spicoli. Jeff, congratulations.
things looked rough out there today.
I'll tell you, Stu, I did battle with some humongous waves.
just like I told the guy on ABC, "Danger is my business.
a lot of people expected Mark "Cutback" Davis, or Bob "Jungle Vet" Gerard...
would take the honors this year. - Those guys are fags!
let me ask you. When you get out there, do you ever fear for your life?
Stu, surfing's not a sport. It's a way of life. It's no hobby.
it's a way of looking at that wave and saying, "Hey, bud, let's party! "
Where'd you get this jacket?
from the network. Let me ask you, what's next for Jeff Spicoli?
headed over to the Australian and then the Hawaiian Internationals.
then me and Mick are gonna wing on over to London and jam with the Stones.
you guys are invited too.
Jeff! Jeff!
Jeff, Dad says you have to get up.
leave me alone. - Dad says you're gonna be late again, you butthole!
leave me alone! - Dad says you're gonna be late again, you booger!
dad, Jeff threw his snorkel at me!
we just want to say that we're not Spirit Bunnies anymore.
we always hated that name. It bugged the heck out of Dina and me.
it's just such a put-down! - Really!
we know you've got a lot of spirit, everybody, right?
and we're gonna destroy Lincoln next week! All right!
you know, it takes a lot of courage to get up here...
and do something that you know people will make fun of.
Yeah. - Man...
I'm never gonna talk to those guys again.
I'm the one who got Arnold and Dave their jobs there in the first place.
if you'd apologize to Dennis, I'm sure he'd take you back.
fuck Dennis Taylor! I'm not gonna apologize to that wimp.
I'm just glad we're still together...
because a lot's happened, and I really need you this year.
look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this.
we're almost out of school. It's our last year.
and I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, to go out with other people.
I still want to be friends.
what do I say to her once we get in the car?
no problem, Rat. What you need is my special five-point plan.
come on, Damone, I need real help.
What'd you mean? Men have died...
trying to obtain this valuable information.
but I'll give it to you for free. - What's your five-point plan?
all right. Now, pay attention.
first of all, you never let on how much you like a girl.
Oh, Debbie... hi.
two. You always call the shots.
kiss me, you won't regret it.
three. Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.
isn't this great?
four.
when ordering food, find out what she wants, then order for the both of you.
it's a classy move.
the lady will have the linguine in a white clam sauce, and a coke with no ice.
and five.
now, this is most important, Rat.
when it comes down to makin' out, whenever possible, put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV.
this is a nice car. - Yeah. It's my sister's.
yeah?
do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She's pretty good. - Yeah, she is pretty good.
have you decided? - Um, yeah.
I'll have the knockwurst.
excellent.
you work at Cinema Four, right?
that must be great. You get to see all those free movies.
you get free popcorn.
are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
would you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Oh, no, go ahead.
are you ready to order here?
she will have the knockwurst.
and you?
I'll have the same. - Anything to drink?
coke. - Two Cokes.
okay. Thank you.
I'll be right back. - Okay.
Hello? - Mike, it's Mark.
what happened to your date? - It's happening right now. Everything's fine except...
I left my wallet at home.
why don't you go home and get it?
no, I can't! I'm here. The food's coming and everything.
look, would you do me a favor?
just borrow your mom's car, drive to my house, get my wallet and bring it here.
Hello? Mike?
Mike?
geez, I'm really kinda busy, Rat.
just do me this one favor.
I swear I won't ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other.
but just please do this for me. - You owe me for this one.
okay, thanks. Thanks a lot. Thanks.
beaver, are you all right? - What happened?
are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
do you want another Coke?
um... okay.
two more Cokes.
two more Cokes.
Hey, Mark, is that you? - Yeah, hi.
you come here? - Yeah. I come for the strudel. It's great.
Hey, listen, I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Oh, wow! Yeah. I was looking for this.
Oh, Mike, you don't know Stacy Hamilton.
Stacy, this is Mike Damone. - Hi.
Hi. - Nice to meet you.
see you later.
right. Gotta be goin'. See you later.
you wanna go?
um... yeah.
I had a really nice time tonight. - Me too.
I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
I never thought it would've happened at such a fancy place.
I know. You want to come in for a sec?
okay, sure. - Good.
Where's your brother? - He's out tonight with some friends.
can I get you something to drink? - No, that's... that's okay.
Oh. Well, would you mind if I change?
no.
okay. Could you get this for me? It always sticks.
Thanks.
where are your parents?
my parents are out of town for the weekend.
Brad and I are watching the house.
this is a really nice picture of you. - Thanks.
you can come in my room if you want.
so, what do you want to do?
I don't know.
um, you want to look at a photo album?
I keep a lot of pictures from when I grew up and stuff.
it's kinda stupid, huh? - Sure! Yeah.
yeah? Great.
photographs.
this is the one that Brad took.
it's like double-image type thing, you know. It's like a mirror.
this is me being stupid.
and this is my dog Gypsy, and my cat Tullio.
they're dead now. - Remember him? Mr. Degan?
you had Degan?
he always wore the same suit! - The same suit!
he must've had 500 of those suits. - He was terrible!
no, I think it was one.
so you go out there and you get one too. Love rules Ohh, love rules Love rules. Yeah, love rules - You know, I just thought of something. - What?

no. Look, l... She gets crazy.
her car is her baby.
I better be going. - Really?
I'll call you. Well, I'll see you in class. Okay?
Bye.
love rules. - Mark Ratner doesn't like me. - Mark Ratner doesn't like you? You're crazy!
no, he shows absolutely no interest in me.
mark Ratner is definitely somebody you'd have to make the first move with.
Linda, I did. I made the first move, I made the second move.
I made a complete jerk out of myself, is what I did.
what do you care about Mark Ratner for?
he's a 16-year-old usher in the movie theater.
you have dated older guys. You work at the best food stand in the mall.
and you are a close personal friend of mine.
Yeah. But I was really beginning to like him.
yeah? If that's true, you better find somebody else fast.
seen the new Playboy? - Good?
Bo Derek's tits! - All right!
I like sex.
people on ludes should not drive.
Hey, this is my brother's car!
you said he was outta town. - And he is.

he's got this ultimate set of tools. I can fix it!
you can't fix this car, Spicoli!
I can fix it. - Ha.

I'm giving you $50... - No, no, no!
that means if you win I give you $25.
if I win, you give me $5.
you can't lose. - All right.
I'll put you down for $5.

Fourteen-point sp...

Jefferson's gonna really make Lincoln pay for this.
that guy's gonna totally destroy them.
annihilate. You know what I mean?

Linda, did I show you this? He gave me his card.
Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.
maybe we should get a frame for this, and put it up on the wall.
Linda, you're the one who told me I was gonna get a boyfriend at the mall.
do you think he'll call this week? - Why don't you call him?
I can't. - You can. Guys love that sort of thing.
Really? - Yes!
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're 15 years old.
I did it when I was 13. It's no huge thing. It's just sex.

Hey, how you doing? Welcome to Ridgemont.

Hey, Charles, how you doing, buddy? Car looks great. I mean really terrific.
you're really keeping it up wonderfully.
don't fuck with it!
shit! That's my man.
Brad?
Arnold! What's happening? - Can I talk to you a minute?
sure, man.
I really hate Bronco Burger.
ever since they started with the chicken nuggets, everything went downhill.
you have to fry all their greasy food, and you have to polish things.
and the manager's an asshole. I was just wondering...
Arnold, do you want to work at All-American Burger?
Yeah, well, um...
I can probably get you in. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
all right! - Okay.
wait. Did you hear the bell ring?
what bell? - We're here.
Aloha.
my name is Mr. Hand.
I have but one question for you.
can you attend my class?
it is for your own good. And if you can't make it, I can make you.
we have a 20-question quiz every Friday.
your grade is the average of all your quizzes, plus the midterm and final which counts for one-third.
got it?
also...
there will be no eating. E-A-T-l-N-G.
no eating in this class!
you get used to doing your own business on your own time.
that's one demand I make.
just like you wouldn't want me to come to your house...
and discuss U. S. History on your time, understand? - Yes, sir.
this guy's been stoned since the third grade.
yes? - Yeah, I'm registered in this class.
what class? - This is U. S. History.
I see the globe right there. - Really?
Hey. May I come in?
Oh, please!
I get so lonely when I hear that third attendance bell ring...
and all my kids are not here.
sorry, I'm late. It's just like this new schedule's totally confusing.
I know that dude!
Mr. Spicoli.
that's the name they gave me.
you're ripping my card! - Yes.
Hey, bud, what's your problem?
no problem at all.
I think you know where the front office is.
you dick!
I have taken the time to print up a complete schedule...
of class quizzes and the chapters they cover.
please pass them to the desk behind you.
back, back, back.
did you hear about this surfer guy who pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning?
Oh, no! He just called him a dick.
a dick? Oh, God. People exaggerate so much here.
Linda, that girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
I know. Wait. There are three girls at Ridgemont...
who have cultivated the Pat Benatar look.
Chanel Semlar,
Mary Ann Zlotnick in the red tights.
do you think guys find that more attractive?
Stacy, please, give me a break! You are so much prettier!
Yeah, I know, but do you think they'd be better in bed?
what do you mean? You either do it or you don't.
no. There are like... variables that I might not be good at.
like what variables? - Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
what's the big deal?
I never did it. - You've never given a blow job?
never? Stace, there's nothing to it. It's so easy.
check it out.
relax your throat muscles.
don't bite.
and slide it in.
try it again.
good. Push it slowly in and out. You got it.
okay.
can I ask you something and you promise not to laugh? - Sure.
okay. When a guy has an orgasm, how much comes out?
a quart or so.
no, I'm just kidding.
just practice.
I'm not going to a morgue. I'll get my mom to write a note.
nobody's getting me into a room with a bunch of dead guys.
you have to go. I hear it's part of the final.
I hear it's really disgusting. Do you know what they do?
have you heard? - What?
the bodies are dissected and Mr. Vargas pulls out parts of the dead body and holds them up.
you mean, he reaches in and pulls this stuff out?
like stomach and tumors or something? - Yeah, stomach, tumors, entrails.
good day, everyone. My name is Mr. Vargas.
look. I'm a little slow today.
I just switched to Sanka, so have a heart.
all right, now.
the World of Life. That is the name of the textbook we will be using.
I'm in love.
see the mustache coming in, Rat?
you can almost cross it out.
I'm in love. - You are a wuss. Part wimp, part pussy.
what do you mean wuss? This girl is my exact type.
Where'd you see her? - In my biology class.
did you get her number? - No.
did you get her name? - No! No! It's too soon.
it's never too soon, Rat.
a girl decides how far she's gonna let you go in the first five minutes.
what am I supposed to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class...
and say, "Hello. I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me"?
I would.
I can see it all now. This is gonna be just like last summer.
you fell in love with that girl at the Fotomat.
you bought $40 worth of fucking film, and you never even talked to her.
you don't even own a camera!
you tell me, Mike. What should I do?
this is what you do.
start from the minute you walk into biology.
I mean, don't just walk in. Move across the room.
and you don't talk to her.
you use your face. You use your body.
use everything.
that's what I do.
I mean, I just send out this vibe...
and I have personally found that women do respond.
I mean, something happens.
naturally something happens.
you put the vibe out to 30 million chicks, something is gonna happen.
that's the idea, Rat. That's the attitude.
the attitude? - Yeah.
the attitude dictates that you don't care whether she comes, stays, lays or prays.
whatever happens, your toes are still tapping.
now, when you got that then you have the attitude.
good night, Stacy. - Good night, Mom.
just look at that girl with the lights coming up in her eyes. She's got to be somebody's baby. She must be somebody's baby. - You look beautiful. - Thanks. So do you.
where do you feel like going?
I don't know.
how about the Point? - Okay.
all right! The Point it is.
she's got to be somebody's baby. She's so fine. She's probably somebody's only light. Gonna shine tonight. Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight. She's gonna be somebody's only light. Gonna shine tonight. Yeah, she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight.
that's a really nice jacket.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
it's warm. - Yeah, it is. It's really warm.
I wonder how long it will last.
so am I gonna get to first base?
are you really 19? - Yeah, yeah, I am. I'm really 19.
she's gonna be somebody's baby tonight. I try to shut my eyes but I can't get her out of my sight. I know I'm gonna know it but I gotta get over my fright. I'm just gonna walk up to her. I'm gonna talk to her tonight. Gonna shine tonight. Make her mine tonight?
yeah Gonna shine tonight Make her mine tonight
so tell me, do you like Ron?
I like Ron, but it hurt so bad.
don't worry. Keep doing it. It gets a lot better. I swear.
it better.
raised on the radio. Just an all-American boy. I got my favorite toy. I was raised on the radio. Yeah, I was raised on the radio. Remembering when times were bad. Love is all we need and love was all we had. - Mom says to clean the pool. - Why can't you do it?
your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
your friends use the pool too. - I take out the garbage!
Brad!
Brad, have Mom and Dad seen these? - They're not home yet.
Brad? - What?
what would you say if I asked you to put these...
in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them?
I'd say, "Who the hell is Ron Johnson?" - Please.
thank you very much.
Lisa's great! - Yeah.
I don't understand why you want to break up with a girl like that.
me and Lisa have been going together for two years. I love her and all.
I mean, she's great in bed.
it's just that... I'm a single, successful guy.
and this is my last year in school. This could be the best year of my life!
I just feel like I need my freedom now, you know?
okay, here's your preparation stuff.
you got your sliced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, secret sauce.
what's the secret sauce? - Thousand Island dressing.
what's the secret sauce at Bronco Burger?
ketchup and mayonnaise. - Gotcha.
order for you, Bradley.
were those flowers really for me? - Of course!
how much did they cost? - Don't worry about it.
want to go to The Point tonight?
what's there to do at The Point?
what do you mean? We've been going out together for two years.
I don't want to have to use sex as a tool, Brad.
tool? Tool for what? We've been going together for two years!
I don't want to talk about it here. - I wanna talk about it!
Brad? - Lisa!
Brad!
you gotta flip them, or they'll burn. Great.
three weeks we've been talking about the Platt Amendment.
what are you people, on dope?
a piece of legislation was introduced into Congress by Senator John Platt.
it was passed in 1906.
this amendment to our Constitution has a profound impact upon all of our.
where is Jeff Spicoli? I saw him earlier today near the first floor bathrooms.
is he still on campus? Anyone? Yes, Desmond?
I saw him by the food machines.
how long ago? - Right before class.
okay. Bring him in.
what is this fascination with truancy?
what is it that gets inside your heads?
there are some teachers in this school who look the other way at truants.
it's a little game that you both play.
they pretend they don't see you. You pretend you don't ditch.
now, who pays the price later? You!
wait a minute. There's no birthday party for me here!
Hola, Mr. Hand.
what's the reason for your truancy?
just couldn't make it on time.
you mean, you couldn't or you wouldn't?
it was like a full crowd scene at the food lines.
food will be eaten on your time.
why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli?
why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
I don't know.
I like that.
I don't know." That's nice!
Mr. Hand, will I pass this class?
gee, Mr. Spicoli, I don't know!
that's nice. I really like that. You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm going to leave your words on this board for all my classes to enjoy.
giving you full credit, of course, Mr. Spicoli!
all right.
sleigh bells ring are you listening. - Mommy! - In the lane - Oh, no! - Snow is glistening. A beautiful sight We're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland.
how fucking long do I have to wait?
Christmas sucks. I hate it.
you gotta get used to working holidays. People are always screaming.
I have to quit this job. I'm gonna get so fat...
no one's gonna want to take me out. - Ron hasn't called, huh?
not since November. - What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman.
What'd you wanna do, marry him? Have kids with him?
have this guy come home 50 years old and bald?
and have that little Pacific Stereo sign on? Come on, Stace.
Hey, it's his loss.
got any Blue Oyster Cult?
no, I don't have any Blue Oyster Cult.
I ate 34 pairs last time. Where were you?
I was that close to working at 7-Eleven, you know.
what?
all right! Play me? - Totally.
you got quarters?
when are those Earth, Wind and Fire tickets coming in?
earth, Wind and Fire? Geez, I haven't heard anything.
the minute I do, I'll let you know.
I'm planning on taking my little brother over here.
is that your little brother? He's a good-looking kid.
great. Charles Jefferson...
for Earth, Wind and Fire and little brother.
I'll let you know when they come around, okay?
Wow! Does he really live here? I thought he just flew in for games.
shit! He knows where to come when he wants some tickets.
go on. Get outta here. You're messing up my business.
come on, Rat. Let's go get you a woman.
Wow.
you ready for your moment of truth?
Damone, I noticed I was starting to get a pimple this morning...
rat, the shyness routine is really starting to aggravate me.
I mean, who is she, anyway? She's a waitress in a pizza parlor.
look at her. Look at you. A member of the Honor Roll.
assistant to the assistant manager of the movie theater.
rat, if this girl can't smell your qualifications, then who needs her, right?
right. - All right. How do you feel?
I feel good. - Do ya? All right.
now stop fucking around and go get her.
Hey, Rat, you gotta ace that jacket.
yeah? - Yeah. All right, that's cool.
you look good. All right? Go get her.
$1. 10, and you get five cents back.
Thanks.
Hi! Don't I know you from biology class? - Yeah!
what can I do for you? - I had a couple of questions. I was curious.
what do you do with the jackets people leave here?
we keep 'em. - You keep 'em?
in case they come back. You can look through it if you want.
no, that's cool. It would take too long to look through all that.
I'll pick up a new one.
what was your other question?
Oh, my other question is...
can I have your phone number so I can ask you out sometime?
do you have a pen? This one's out of ink. - Yeah.
Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy. My name is Mark Ratner.
I've gotta go.
Lisa, I have something to tell you.
look, I'm a senior now.
I'm a single, successful guy.
and I've got to be fair to myself.
Lisa... I think I need my freedom.
Oh, don't do that.
please, please don't do that. - Brad!
can you cover me on register two? - Okay.
may I help you? - Ah, yes.
this is not the best breakfast I ever ate and...
I'd like my money back. - Okay. I believe you have to fill out a form.
no. I'd like my money back now.
I'm sorry. It doesn't work that way. I have to fill out a form.
well, you ate most of it already so...
see that sign? It says "100% guaranteed.
you know what the meaning of guarantee is? Did they teach you that here?
sir, if you'd just wait a minute.
look. Just put your little hand in the cash register...
and give me my $2. 75 back, please, Brad.
sir, if you'd just give me a minute. I'll find the forms. I'll take care of everything.
I don't have a minute. You've made me late enough.
I am so tired of dealing with incompetence.
it says 100% guaranteed, you moron!
mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
Ah, is there a problem here? Can I help you, sir?
you bet you have a problem. Your employee used profanity and threatened me with violence.
I'm surprised. I eat here all the time and usually have good service.
all I wanted was my money back on this breakfast. It was a little under-cooked.
and he threatens me with violence. I'm gonna call your super...
I can take care of it.
Mr. Hamilton, did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
uh... he insulted me first. He called me a moron, Dennis.
answer me! Did you threaten this customer or use profanity?
Yes. - You're fired.
I'm very sorry, sir. I'll refund your money right now.
I hope you won't hold this against us.
you know how these young kids are these days.
here we are. Perhaps another breakfast?
I hope you had a hell of a piss, Arnold!
the world's finest surfers showed up today to do battle...
with what's turned out to be the biggest waves to hit this coast since 1946.
hello. I'm Stu Nahan, and I'd like you to meet this young man.
his name, Jeff Spicoli. Jeff, congratulations.
things looked rough out there today.
I'll tell you, Stu, I did battle with some humongous waves.
just like I told the guy on ABC, "Danger is my business."
a lot of people expected Mark "Cutback" Davis, or Bob "Jungle Vet" Gerard would take the honors this year. - Those guys are fags!
let me ask you. When you get out there, do you ever fear for your life?
Stu, surfing's not a sport. It's a way of life. It's no hobby.
it's a way of looking at that wave and saying, "Hey, bud, let's party!
Where'd you get this jacket?
from the network. Let me ask you, what's next for Jeff Spicoli?
headed over to the Australian and then the Hawaiian Internationals.
then me and Mick are gonna wing on over to London and jam with the Stones.
you guys are invited too.
Jeff! Jeff!
Jeff, Dad says you have to get up.
leave me alone. - Dad says you're gonna be late again, you butthole!
leave me alone! - Dad says you're gonna be late again, you booger!
dad, Jeff threw his snorkel at me!
we just want to say that we're not Spirit Bunnies anymore.
we always hated that name. It bugged the heck out of Dina and me.
it's just such a put-down! - Really!
we know you've got a lot of spirit, everybody, right?
and we're gonna destroy Lincoln next week! All right!
you know, it takes a lot of courage to get up here...
and do something that you know people will make fun of.
Yeah. - Man...
I'm never gonna talk to those guys again.
I'm the one who got Arnold and Dave their jobs there in the first place.
if you'd apologize to Dennis, I'm sure he'd take you back.
fuck Dennis Taylor! I'm not gonna apologize to that wimp.
I'm just glad we're still together...
because a lot's happened, and I really need you this year.
look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this.
we're almost out of school. It's our last year.
and I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, to go out with other people.
I still want to be friends.
what do I say to her once we get in the car?
no problem, Rat. What you need is my special five-point plan.
come on, Damone, I need real help.
What'd you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this valuable information
but I'll give it to you for free. - What's your five-point plan?
all right. Now, pay attention.
first of all, you never let on how much you like a girl.
Oh, Debbie... hi.
two. You always call the shots.
kiss me, you won't regret it.
three. Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.
isn't this great?
four.
when ordering food, find out what she wants, then order for the both of you.
it's a classy move.
the lady will have the linguine in a white clam sauce, and a coke with no ice.
and five.
now, this is most important, Rat.
when it comes down to makin' out, whenever possible, put on side one of Led Zeppelin IV.
this is a nice car. - Yeah. It's my sister's.
yeah?
do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She's pretty good. - Yeah, she is pretty good.
have you decided? - Um, yeah.
I'll have the knockwurst.
excellent.
you work at Cinema Four, right?
that must be great. You get to see all those free movies.
you get free popcorn.
are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
would you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Oh, no, go ahead.
are you ready to order here?
she will have the knockwurst.
and you?
I'll have the same. - Anything to drink?
coke. - Two Cokes.
okay. Thank you.
I'll be right back. - Okay.
Hello? - Mike, it's Mark.
what happened to your date? - It's happening right now. Everything's fine except...
I left my wallet at home.
why don't you go home and get it?
no, I can't! I'm here. The food's coming and everything.
look, would you do me a favor?
just borrow your mom's car, drive to my house, get my wallet and bring it here.
Hello? Mike?
Mike?
geez, I'm really kinda busy, Rat.
just do me this one favor.
I swear I won't ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other.
but just please do this for me. - You owe me for this one.
okay, thanks. Thanks a lot. Thanks.
beaver, are you all right? - What happened?
are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
do you want another Coke?
um... okay.
two more Cokes.
two more Cokes.
Hey, Mark, is that you? - Yeah, hi.
you come here? - Yeah. I come for the strudel. It's great.
Hey, listen, I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Oh, wow! Yeah. I was looking for this.
Oh, Mike, you don't know Stacy Hamilton.
Stacy, this is Mike Damone. - Hi.
Hi. - Nice to meet you.
see you later.
right. Gotta be going. See you later.
you wanna go?
um... yeah.
I had a really nice time tonight. - Me too.
I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
I never thought it would've happened at such a fancy place.
I know. You want to come in for a sec?
okay, sure. - Good.
Where's your brother? - He's out tonight with some friends.
can I get you something to drink? - No, that's... that's okay.
Oh. Well, would you mind if I change?
no.
okay. Could you get this for me? It always sticks.
Thanks.
where are your parents?
my parents are out of town for the weekend.
Brad and I are watching the house.
this is a really nice picture of you. - Thanks.
you can come in my room if you want.
so, what do you want to do?
I don't know.
um, you want to look at a photo album?
I keep a lot of pictures from when I grew up and stuff.
it's kinda stupid, huh? - Sure! Yeah.
yeah? Great.
photographs.
this is the one that Brad took.
it's like double-image type thing, you know. It's like a mirror.
this is me being stupid.
and this is my dog Gypsy, and my cat Tullio.
they're dead now. - Remember him? Mr. Degan?
you had Degan?
he always wore the same suit! - The same suit!
he must've had 500 of those suits. - He was terrible!
no, I think it was one.
so you go out there and you get one too. Love rules. Ohh, love rules Love rules. Yeah, love rules. - You know, I just thought of something. - What?
my sister is crazy when it comes to her car.
it's gotta be back by 11: 00. - Want to call her?
no. Look, l... She gets crazy.
her car is her baby.
I better be going. - Really?
I'll call you. Well, I'll see you in class. Okay?
Bye.
love rules. - Mark Ratner doesn't like me. - Mark Ratner doesn't like you? You're crazy!
no, he shows absolutely no interest in me.
mark Ratner is definitely somebody you'd have to make the first move with.
Linda, I did. I made the first move, I made the second move.
I made a complete jerk out of myself, is what I did.
what do you care about Mark Ratner for?
he's a 16-year-old usher in the movie theater.
you have dated older guys. You work at the best food stand in the mall.
and you are a close personal friend of mine.
Yeah. But I was really beginning to like him.
yeah? If that's true, you better find somebody else fast.
seen the new Playboy? - Good?
Bo Derek's tits! - All right!
I like sex.
people on ludes should not drive.
Hey, this is my brother's car!
you said he was outta town. - And he is.
all right. Then don't hassle it.
are you crazy, Spicoli? That light was red!
it was yellow a minute ago. - You're gonna scratch my brother's car.
no, I'm not.
look, I'm driving. You navigate.
where is this party?
make a right, right here. Here! Here! Here!
my brother's gonna kill us! He's gonna kill us!
he's gonna kill you. He's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us!
Hey, man, just be glad I had fast reflexes.
my brother's gonna shit! - Make up your mind, dude.
is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
first he's gonna shit, then he's gonna kill us.
relax, all right? My old man is a television repairman.
he's got this ultimate set of tools. I can fix it!
you can't fix this car, Spicoli!
I can fix it. - Ha.
Hey!
I'm giving you $50... - No, no, no!
that means if you win I give you $25.
if I win, you give me $5.
you can't lose. - All right.
I'll put you down for $5.
now, don't forget about the 14-point spread.
Fourteen-point sp...
I don't believe those guys at Lincoln did this to Jefferson's car!
they totalled it. I can't believe it.
Jefferson's gonna really make Lincoln pay for this.
that guy's gonna totally destroy them.
annihilate. You know what I mean?
shit, he is pissed off.
Yes! - Hey! Was that a goal?
no, just checking if you're awake.
smart aleck!
bad enough getting all the dirty work.
Frank, do you hear me?
Yeah, what's up?
see anything on the monitors?
no. Why? Is there a problem?
no, it's just... I must have been dreaming, sorry.
Oh, Dom! Dom, you were right.
there's someone behind you! Do you hear?
right behind you! - Where?
there's no one behind me.
the dirty scoundrel!
he's on the top floor! I'm on my way! We'll get him!
perfect! We'll corner him!
where are you precisely?
not very far. And where are you precisely?
a Cat in Paris .
Ooh, Zoe, what a fright! I didn't hear you come in.
what is it? A new present from Dino?
Waow! Another lizard!
you lucky girl, that cat really spoils you!
well then... It makes a change from sweets and toys.
cat presents.
Yes. No. Listen, Lucas, we'll discuss it tomorrow at the office.
I need a few hours off, do you understand?
I promised my daughter.
either way, I need that report on my desk by tomorrow.
you'll manage! I can't always be there.
but, what's that about?
she had something to show you.
something? What was it?
Oh, nothing really. You know how kids are.
she's very sensitive, and she was waiting for you.
I'm getting everything wrong. I'm so exhausted.
it's been very tough, just me and Zoe.
if only her father was still here.
I miss him so much.
please don't cry, Madame, or you'll have me in tears too.
Zoe,
may I come in?
I'm so sorry for earlier.
I've got a lot on at work right now.
and sometimes I can't help bringing it home with me.
anyway, I'm glad it's going well with Claudine.
I really like her, apart from that perfume of hers!
so what was it you wanted to show me, Zoe?
Oh dear, what a horror!
was it Dino again?
Zoe, this really has to stop!
all these dead creatures in your room, it's unhygienic.
look, I have to take this call.
Hello?
no. I'm at home, guys.
just ask Lucas! I'm sure he can help you out.
do you need me for anything else? Can I go?
Yes, Claudine, that's fine.
thanks again for all your help.
Bye, sweetie.
good evening, Claudine. - Good night, Madame. See you tomorrow.
I'm sorry for telling you off earlier but I can't stand creepy crawlies.
little girls shouldn't play with spiders and dead lizards, especially inside the house, don't you agree?
I know who you're thinking about.
since he left us, I feel like nothing's right between us anymore.
there's nothing worse than a girl losing her father.
but sadly, nothing will bring him back.
we just have to go on without him.
it would make me so happy if from to time, you called me Mum.
take your time, I can wait.
forever if need be.
now let's forget about all this.
how about going to see a film on Sunday?
we haven't been in ages.
Ah, looks like it's time for our terrible Tom to go out on the prowl.
I wonder what that naughty creature gets up to every night, don't you?
Rufus! Be quiet!
shut up!
hello there, Mr Cat.
I thought you weren't coming, so I started without you.
get your strength up for tonight's expedition!
you'll like what I've got in store for us tonight.
come on, old boy, let's go. There's work to be done.
are you coming?
you show-off.
Hey, don't rush off so fast!
I've got something to show you. Look!
not bad, huh?
what does Mr. Fish-lover say to that?
stay if you want, you're not bothering me.
I'm always alone anyway, so...
Zoe, you've been going through my briefcase again!
you know I don't like you doing that!
Yes, darling, that's the man who shot your father.
but I'm on his trail, you know.
soon I'll catch him, we'll throw him in prison, and we'll never hear of him again. That's a promise!
you're my special treasure, my wonderful little girl.
never forget how much I love you.
morning. - Hello, superintendent.
nearly done, 10 more minutes.
leave it to one side. I need you to do something for me.
OK. No problem.
remember the serial jewellery burglaries?
Yes. - I just got the lab reports back.
cat paw prints were found every time.
cat paws?
the boss wants results.
it's your case. I want something new within 24 hours, OK?
no problem. As usual!
right, got to go. I have a meeting with the boss.
I'm supposed to arrest a cat?
that's what ten years on the force gets you.
get out of here, you filthy beast!
go on! Get out! Now!
get out, I don't want you here. Out, I said!
go on, off with you!
I'm going to suck you right up!
there you go! Good riddance!
your attention, please.
this is the Colossus of Nairobi.
a priceless piece, not shown in public for over 30 years.
it's scheduled to be transported to the museum next Friday.
Victor Costa requires no introduction from me, you all know this city's Public Enemy No. 1.
he'll be out to get the Colossus by any means possible.
last time he almost succeeded, and, as you know, that cost...
it cost the life of a police officer.
what's up with her? - The guy who got killed was her husband!
no need to tell you to be careful, the man is a raving lunatic, who's extremely dangerous!
let's take a look at the route the van with the Colossus will be taking.
I'm convinced that's when Costa will try to strike.
that's all for this morning. See you at target practice.
look, guys, I've dreamt of this since I was just a toddler.
my mother stuck this photo above my cradle.
this Colossus! It has to be mine! Do you hear?!
here he is, he's back...
what took you so long?!
the queue was endless and there wasn't that much choice.
ham? - Over here, hand it over Bob!
the hot dog's for me.
eat up, we haven't got all day!
what about my sausage sandwich?
they don't do sausage.
I got you chicken instead. - You trying to kill me?!
feathered stuff brings me out in a rash. I wanted a sausage sandwich.
it's not my fault they don't have sausage.
so you decide to poison me!
cool it, Jack! I'll swap you my hot dog.
deal! Hand it over.
Hey, I'm the one he offered it to!
what is yours anyway? - Hey, it's my hot dog!
boss, sure you're not hungry? Not even for a quiche?
you mean a quiche with bacon?
Yes! With melted cheese on top!
and cream? Is there cream in it too?
Oh yes, boss, loads of cream, you'll love it.
so I look like a quiche-eater to you?
Quiche-eater: A man who is effeminate or who lacks some putative masculine virtue .
well, no... I don't know.
you were asking: Cream, no cream?
no copping out now!
I look like the kind of guy who's into quiche! That's what you're saying?
had you going there, didn't I?
you had your knickers in a twist, there.
dammit, you had me scared, Boss!
you're very good!
you want to know how I like my cream quiches?
drive, you idiot, before I get really annoyed!
Zoe, what's this?
no, no, I don't mean the drawing,
I mean the bracelet! Where does it come from?
you mean Dino brought it you?
Zoe, sweetie, listen, I'm glad Dino's not bringing you those horrible creatures any more, but you can't keep wearing something that valuable.
look, there's a diamond in it.
darling, there's someone out there who's really unhappy at losing their bracelet.
we'll have to find them and give it back to them.
I'm very proud of you, Zoe.
my cat picked this bracelet up in the street.
don't ask me how, I don't have a clue.
check if there's a link with the break-in on Rue Mouffetard.
OK then. See you later.
the break-in on rue Mouffetard.
well, my love, I'm going now, I have to work tonight.
Claudine's staying.
now, you try to get off to sleep straight away, OK?
sleep well, little Zoe.
stop it!
stop it!
Rufus, stop it.
stop it, Rufus! Every night the same thing!
Aaargh! Rufus!
you asked for it!
Rufus, are you going to shut it, once and for all?!
Ah, there you are!
you're late tonight!
what happened?
I was about to leave without you, old boy!
have you looked at me? I'm not a potato!
I know you're not, that's not the point.
I've told you, they're just code names.
Yeah, I know, code names, but "Potato" is ridiculous!
you think I like being called Mister "Baby"?
shut it! That's enough, alright?!
you are Mister Frog.
you, Mister Baby.
you, Mister Hulot.
and you are Mister Potato. Understood?
Yes, yes, fine! OK, boss.
and what's your code name, boss?
I'm the Colossus, the Colossus of Nairobi!
that's a really good name!
that's enough! We're wasting time.
so, anything new, my lovely?
keep your voice down. Here, this'll make you happy.
it's the transfer date of the Colossus, but staying around this area, it's risky.
be a bit patient. - I'm running out of patience.
go through her papers, her computer, her dustbins.
I need the security van's route.
you don't want my cover blown, do you?
what's going on? - It's the kid! She heard everything!
don't let her get away! Get her, guys! Quick!
do we go in after her? - You think we can go in there?
get out the way, you idiots!
search the place and bring me the kid. Right now!
OK, boss!
I know you're here, little girl.
hiding in the back of one of these cupboards.
great cupboards, aren't they? Well laid out and very comfy?
you're Zoe, aren't you?
I know about all sorts, you see!
not too dark in there for you, eh?
you know what gets on my nerves?
in films, the victim always hides in the last cupboard.
Where's the suspense in that?
I'm counting to three, little piggy, and then I'm going to blow your house down.
one... Two... Three...
boss, come and look, it's amazing!
you've found the kid?
better than that, Mister Costa!
why don't you shout out my address, whilst you're at it?
the code names, not real names, you stupid ass!
sorry, boss, but come and look!
so, where's the kid?
there, look!
look where? There's no kid here!
the dartboard! - Are you winding me up?
please wake me up from this nightmare!
wait a minute, just take a look at the dartboard!
I'll take the dartboard and... - No, no, no.
wait, Hulot's going to throw a dart.
how about that!
ali Baba's cavern. And I found it!
when he sees a dart game, he can never resist.
that takes the biscuit!
I've stumbled on to someone's stash!
but whose place is this?
so, little snoop, proud of yourself?
what am I supposed to do after this?
calm down, you little pest! - Hum, Hum. Sorry to disturb you.
what are you doing in my house? - It's the girl's fault.
she's a real tearaway. I spend my time chasing after her.
don't mind her, she's a bit retarded. Come along, Zoe!
wait! I don't think she wants to go with you.
who are you? Her mother?
Zoe, come! We're going!
I think you should let her go.
colossus!
problem! The owner's come back!
don't move, we're coming!
you wouldn't dare hit a woman!
Ouch!
nasty beast!
I'll hurt my shoulder!
it won't budge. Forget it.
I know! We need a thingamy to lever it.
trust me! Climb on to my back and hold on as tight as you can.
or else we pull... or we could... - Stop rabbiting!
just break this damn door down!
they're climbing up the roof! Over there, look!
guys, help me! I'm slipping!
come and help me! I'm gonna break my neck!
Thanks, Boss, phew! Colossus.
er... is it Colossus when it's just us two, or only when there's other people around?
shut it!
look, Zoe, you see that hedge over there? Behind it is the zoo.
you go with the cat, he'll take you to my place.
I'll create a diversion, then come and find you.
go now!
over there! That's him! - There he is!
Hmm! Smells like fresh meat!
what's up, boss?
never mind. She's had it.
we've got her!
look. I told you. She can't go very far.
come on, hurry up!
yes? What is it?
evening, Madam. Police.
Ooh, what have...? - No need to worry, madam.
I just have a little question.
a cat living in the brick house over there, mean anything to you?
Oh yes, I know that cat, a real piece of work.
every night of the week he sets the neighbour's yappy little dog barking.
it drives me mad.
Yes, but do you have any idea where this cat goes?
well, he certainly doesn't go very far.
he leaves from there, makes the nasty little dog bark, and disappears into the house opposite.
every night it's the same routine.
so are you going to do something about it, officer?
Hello?
what?
you've got a lead on the cat-burglar?
where are you?
near my place?! How come? OK, I'm on my way.
I can't go on, I can't go on.
come on, make an effort!
he's going to get away!
I didn't digest the sandwich.
think how angry Colossus will be if we don't catch him!
need a lift, guys?
looks like the tables have turned, eh?
it doesn't work! - Stop it!
you think he's dead?
believe me, after a fall like that you'd have a bit more than a bump on the head.
if you had a head left at all!
go on, Mr. Frog. Get her! I'm stuck in the mud!
Yeah, but there's no boats left.
remind me what your codename is, you idiot!
Mr. Frog.
so you're already half way there.
go on! Get going. Hop in.
Yeah, but... "Frog" is only a nickname.
I don't give a damn!
your name is Frog, and frogs swim, so get moving and jump in!
d'you mind telling me what you're up to, you idiot?
well, I can't go in with my clothes on, can I?
okay, I'm going, boss.
Oh, it's really freezing!
that's better!
hey you there, you horrible little brat! Playtime's over!
I don't believe it!
OK, let me guess: You can't actually swim, can you?!
nobody ever taught me, boss. What about you, can you?
mind your own business, you fool!
colossus of Nairobi, why have you abandoned me?!
Zoe?
Zoe?
Ah! There you both are.
I see you found the old swing.
it's on its last legs, you know.
with everything that's just happened, we haven't even talked.
I haven't even told you my name: Nico.
so, are you going to tell me what happened?
do you not want to talk to me?
cat got your tongue, eh?
well, you don't talk but at least you can laugh.
now, can you tell me where your parents are?
you do have a mum and dad, don't you?
what's up?
did I say something wrong?
I see. Anyway, we can't stay here, they may come back.
I know a place we can hide for the night, but first I'll have to get the key, okay?
stay here, I'll only be a minute.
Zoe?
police! Don't move!
Oh no! No! - I said, don't move!
I was right, Superintendent, this is the burglar we've been after.
and it looks like your cat's his accomplice.
you don't understand!
it's not what you think! It's just I was there when...
let's go. You can tell the judge all about it.
in case you didn't know, you kidnapped my daughter.
a cop's daughter.
you've just landed yourself in a whole load of trouble.
calm down, Zoe. There's nothing to be scared of now.
come on, head down!
your game's up!
Ooh, I'll have you too! It's the animal pound for you!
Oh, my little sweetie! You've no idea how scared I was!
I don't understand what's going on. Explain it to me!
it's that crook there!
he got into the house, to burgle us.
when he saw me, he panicked and grabbed Zoe from her bed and ran off with her.
who is that woman?! - Mind your own business.
listen to me! It's not me, - it's that woman who wants to harm the girl! - Shut it, okay!
car 17, we've got news for you.
Lucas. I'm listening...
it's all over, my princess.
there, there.
let's go home.
I'll stay with you all night.
superintendent, I know this really isn't the moment, but if I don't warn you straight away.
what is it now?
the night watchman at the zoo was attacked by some kind of thug.
he photoidentified him. It's our man, Costa!
Costa! - There's a chance we can catch him.
listen to me, Zoe,
I'm going to say the exact opposite of what I just promised.
I have to leave.
it's very important for both of us.
it's the man who killed your daddy.
I can't let him get away!
do you understand, Zoe? - Don't worry, madame, the poor thing's in shock but I'll calm her down.
let me take her home.
Yes, thank you.
Zoe, I'll be back really soon! I promise!
don't worry, I'll take care of everything.
Mmm... Mmmmu... Mu...
mum!
you've left it a bit late to find your voice, you little brat!
when you arrested me I was in the process of saving your daughter.
it's a well-known fact: All kidnappers are actually saviours.
I can't believe you're completely unaware that your nanny's in cahoots with Costa!
you can stop the fairy tales, they're getting boring...
but it's the honest truth!
and all the money we found in your bag?
that's for good works in the community, I suppose?
it's the same with all of them, they always have a story.
be careful!
I can't see the road! - The brakes, Lucas! Break!
Dino, stop! Let go of him!
now you're going to listen to me!
you're making the biggest mistake of your life.
believe what you want, but if I were you, I'd go back home immediately.
your daughter Zoe is in terrible danger!
he's an odd one, that one.
I'm missing something and it's making me uneasy.
what if he's right?
come on, Lucas, we're going to my home to check.
Zoe?
Claudine?
Zoe?!
I have a bad feeling about this.
