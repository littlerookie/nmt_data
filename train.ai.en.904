tip of the iceberg, pal.
okay...
tell me what I don't know.
sorry, no can do.
the more I know, the more I might be able to help.
ain't gonna happen.
you're willing to face a murder two rap.
but you won't tell me about this!
unless you're trying protecting someone.
hunting down "chip monkeys" isn't the only thing worth dying for.
but not facing the consequences of bill cole's testimony is?
come on!
I told you when you brought me on board this team, you knew everything about me you needed to know.
you had my word that I would not jeopardize this team or, intentionally, put anyone at risk.
I think I made good on that.
anything beyond that promise is personal.
bill cole's scheduled to testify tomorrow.
nice to know the date and time of your own execution.
so where are we?
pretty much at square one.
Maureen and i came up dry with everyone left on our list.
route truck drivers, delivery personnel.
basically every theory we've been working on.
nothing.
no one had a hunch?
shut up, riley.
no.
No!
I know you're the big boss and you guys go out into the field and grab all the glory but you get to do what you do because I'm in here, doing what I do.
and you know what?
I'm damn good at what I do!
but you're all willing to risk connor's ass because you trust your instincts, your hunches, more than you do what I'm telling you.
I'm right about the pattern, despite connor's lucky guess.
have you stopped to think that maybe the reason the samuel's house didn't fit the pattern is because connor did start that fire?
you don't believe that.
no, but I do believe that if we worked my theory, we might find out who did.
alright, run it again.
alright.
why the guy targets two-story blue houses is anyone's guess.
he's a psycho.
maybe he grew up in a house like that.
hated his mother. His father. The color blue.
I don't know.
but why the garages facing alleys?
because it gives him access.
there've been six fires.
and no one's spotted the fire starter.
Why?
every house has been within a mile of an interstate.
what does this mean?
the guy's on wheels.
what does he do when he finds his target?
park and walk?
or stash his car somewhere in the alleys.
maybe even a neighboring garage.
it's a long shot.
do you have anything better?
we'll have to interface with the locals, get out in the field.
interview some neighbors.
let's roll.
you're going to do it?
like you said, I don't have any better ideas.
Jane, can I have a word.
Yeah.
I told you yesterday I didn't want you committing perjury.
change your mind?
no.
then what?
what I have in mind is a whole lot worse.
today, the judge in the invisible man arsonist case is going to allow testimony of the criminal background of connor king.
bill cole, a former police officer and partner of the defendant,
bill Cole -ex cop Witness of the prosecution is scheduled to take the stand this afternoon.
stay tuned.
excuse me?
you bill cole?
Yeah.
got a message for you.
someone wants to talk to you.
just head back out.
down the hall, through the door on the left.
how are you doing?
against the fence with her.
you'd be dead before your hand hit the knob.
what do you want from us?
you going to tell me what this is about?
it's about two people who are going to testify against a friend of mine.
you still haven't told us who you are.
the man who will kill you if you do.
right here?
with all these cops around?
that would be my problem.
Yes, it would be.
and I don't think you'd take that chance.
try me.
I'm a federal officer
Oh, my god.
so this is how it is.
the "big man," connor king doesn't take any chances.
can't risk anyone finding out that he and I did time together arson charges.
alright pal, let's see how much of a risk you're willing to take.
what are these photographs?
they're our wedding pictures.
Scott Samuels Witness for the prosecution
she's... she was my wife.
I understand the morning of the fire you left for work at around 8: 00 am.
Yes, sir.
and lucy, was it typical for her to be home at that hour?
Yes.
Lucy worked part time.
she didn't usually leave the house until around noon.
you were at work when the police arrived.
Yes.
tell us about that.
two detectives showed up at my office.
they told me there'd been a fire...
they said that someone... that someone had been killed...
they asked me to come down to the medical examiner's office to make an identification.
and did you do that?
Yes.
it was Lucy.
the prosecution calls bill cole to the stand.
Mr. Cole, would you tell the court how you know the defendant, connor king.
I refuse to answer.
excuse me?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it could incriminate me.
you and mr. King served time in prison for crimes committed while you were employed by the metropolitan police.
isn't that so?
objection, leading the witness.
your honor.
this witness has been granted immunity.
the fifth amendment doesn't apply.
Mr. Cole.
the court directs you to answer the questions put to you by the district attorney.
Mr. Cole.
have you ever been arrested or served time in prison?
Mr. Cole...
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate me.
your honor.
Mr. Cole, the court will not be lenient if you continue to refuse to answer.
answer the question.
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate me.
alright, court finds bill cole in contempt.
Bailiff!
Hey!
how'd it go?
we bought some time.
I don't know how much.
well, we've got something.
genius boy strikes again.
at least two neighbors to the previous arsons reported that their garage locks had been broken.
the cops said they found oil stains on the cement in both garages.
not so unusual for a garage.
except one of the residents doesn't own a car.
and in the other garage, a one-car garage with the car in it...
the oil stain was off to the side.
and this tells us...?
I'm having samples run on the oil stains to confirm...
but from everything we can tell, the quantity of oil and the location is that our boy shows up to do his dirty work on a motorcycle.
it does fit.
doesn't give us a name but it gets us a step closer.
even if you're right... I'm not sure this actually helps.
hell, it's more than we had 24 hours ago.
are you forgetting?
Connor rides a motorcycle.
the quality of the material is quite good as are the magnification properties.
Dr. Erich Wilson Witness for the Prosecution
your honor, the defense has stipulated that these towels are the same brand and fiber content as those found in the samuel's home.
noted.
you may proceed.
doctor.
turn on that light, please.
I'm sure many of us remember playing with sunlight and magnification as children.
we'll have to imagine that this is sunlight, coming into the courtroom from the outside.
the degree of magnification would affect the amount of time this would take.
as I said, this sample is quite good.
doctor, is it possible that a magnifying device that you're holding, could that have started the fire in the samuel's house or any of the other fires?
objection.
speculative.
whether the device started the fire or not is not an issue.
to date, there's been no evidence entered to indicate that anyone knows how these fires started.
sustained.
no further questions.
doctor, in a typical house fire, would solid glass be completely consumed by heat or flame?
damaged, perhaps.
completely consumed, unlikely.
so if a device had been used in the fire.
subsequent investigation would have turned up all or part of those magnifying glasses.
that would be true.
if they were made of glass.
it wouldn't take much more than a match flame to turn these into useless ash.
these are made of spun sugar, highly refined.
no further questions, your honor.
Mr. Beetle, would you tell the court where you're employed?
Ralph Beetle Storage facility owner Witness for the prosecution
I own and manage a storage facility just outside of cranston.
this is a facility where anyone can rent space to store their belongings.
precisely.
do you recall accompanying my investigators to storage unit 14d, two weeks ago friday?
Yes, I do.
were you with them when they entered the unit?
they needed my permission and my master key to gain entry.
among the contents of the unit, did you come across this box of magnifying devices.
in fact, we found about a dozen boxes.
that is one of them.
do you recognize this form?
this is one of our standard, long-term contracts.
and that particular contract-- how long has the signatory leased space in storage unit 14d?
two years, three months and fourteen days.
would you read the name of the person to whom that unit was rented?
this is a load of crap!
order!
this court will take a half hour recess.
you know about this?
of course not.
do something!
I'm doing the best I can!
is this your best?
is this your best?
remember this face, beetle, remember it!
I don't believe it, connor entered the samuel's house against orders.
so when has connor done anything by the books.
thought he saw something going on, thought he had a window of opportunity to get the neuro and to get out.
but, from inside the suv, you couldn't see what he was doing in the house.
all you can say is that you saw connor enter the house, saw the fire begin and saw him running out.
what the hell is this?
it sounds like you guys really think he's guilty!
nice to know where your friends stand when things get tough.
it's not about what we think.
you just answered the questions the D. A. Will put to you.
and by the way, bill cole may not be the only one who could testify against connor.
why don't you tell them what you were telling me.
what?
what we were talking about... connor's hunch.
I was thinking about what riley said the other day about things being simple and logical.
we assume that either connor had to be right or riley had to be right.
but given what we learned about the oil stains in the garages...
I started thinking... what if they were both right?
if?
let's assume riley is right about the pattern... about the importance of the garages.
the samuel's house didn't have an alley-facing garage and didn't fit the pattern.
maybe we're not dealing with a pyromaniac at all.
maybe we're dealing with someone who has a motive.
think about it, lucy lived in a two-storey blue house.
so... the neuro wants lucy dead, or maybe scott... to cover his tracks, he torches five other blue, two-story houses.
to avoid the risk of being seen, he looks for houses with alley facing garages.
he doesn't realize there's a crazy genius named riley who sees that as part of the pattern.
by the time he gets to the samuel's place, he thinks it's going to look like just another whack job, blue house arson.
you got that background on the samuel house yet?
I'll find something, I just need a little bit more time.
something connor doesn't have a lot of.
if I was you, I could break every bone in my body, slip through these air holes and walk out of here good as new.
if you were me, you'd look a whole lot better in that orange jumpsuit.
looks pretty grim, huh?
we're working on something.
don't know yet if it'll pay off.
it might help if you told me what happened.
you starting to think I'm guilty?
that's not what I said.
but the more we know...
you know what I want you to know, darlin'.
that's it.
Yeah, it's going to have to be.
Yeah.
on my way.
I gotta go.
Thanks.
see you in court.
what've you got?
I found the original computer file of connor's storage locker rental.
so it's legitimate.
no.
what?
according to the receipt, connor's rented this unit for a little over two years.
but that's the date on the contract.
not the date on the file.
the date on the file is only three weeks old.
maybe it's not the original version.
if someone saved a duplicate copy wouldn't it have a more recent date?
it would.
but every file's embedded with a creation date.
doesn't matter how often it's modified.
this file didn't exist last month.
then someone is setting him up.
here's the kicker.
I traced the file to the computer that created it.
the D. A.'S office.
Connor's attorney.
what?
Why?
that doesn't make any sense.
Yes, it does.
don't give me that!
who do you think you're talking to?
this has got your paw prints all over it.
richard stanley works for you and like most of the people who work for you... he follows orders.
setting connor up for that storage locker rental was your idea.
you're a team leader, mcbride.
you're not the commander-in-chief.
I protect my people.
even if it's from the commander-in-chief.
you don't have the big picture.
I've heard that story before.
sometimes the "little people" have to be sacrificed for the greater cause, is that it?
I don't see the greater cause here, sir?
unless it's protecting your ass.
I don't like your tone.
you're not supposed to.
king's a liability to the team.
and to the work we do.
I made a decision.
it was too late to make thin "go away" as you'd hoped we could.
if king goes away for this now, the rest of our problems will go away with him.
sir... I'm not prepared to let that happen.
you're the field op, mcbride.
in battle, it's your call.
policy is mine.
and policy extends beyond personal feelings and loyalty.
you know that as well as I do.
and you might need to give it some serious thought before you do anything you'll regret.
Richard, here's the new deal.
if I find that you do anything to sabbotage connor's chances to get out of this.
if I don't see that you're doing everything in your power to provide the best defense,
I want you to remember this:
the government spent a lot of money training me, I'm very good at what I do.
I can approach a man from 100 metres and he'll never hear me coming.
I'll let you decide.
do you want to spend every day for the rest of your life looking over your shoulder, waiting...
let's go
well, if that's not a motive for murder,
I don't know what is.
trial Day 5 9 a. m
everything's in place.
stanley has his marching orders.
we've got the new witness.
crowd control?
the judge has agreed to clear the courtroom and hear this outside the jury.
so she finds if it admissible...
let's hope it doesn't get that far.
let's hope it doesn't get too hot to handle.
this court is now in session.
would you state your name for the court?
Ellen Drake Witness for the Defense
miss drake... it is "miss," isn't it?
Yes.
are you familiar with the blue ridge motel?
I know the name, I think...
have you ever been to the blue ridge motel?
I've driven past it.
but you've never actually been on the premises?
no.
your honor, may I approach?
would you look at these photographs.
would you agree that those are photographs of you?
Yes.
what would you say if I told you that those photos were taken from a surveillance camera located in the lobby of the blue ridge motel?
and do you see the time stamps on those photographs?
Yes.
they date back at least a year, don't they?
Yes.
I expect that the reason you perjured yourself in this courtroom is because you were trying to protect someone.
is it possible that you lied because on the dates in question at the blue ridge motel, you were there with a married man?
Yes.
Mr. Samuel'S... on the dates those photographs were taken, were you at the blue ridge motel with miss drake?
I should inform you, those photographs are enlargements.
the originals show the entire office area.
let me ask you again...
on the date in question, were you at the blue ridge motel with miss drake?
Yes.
would it be reasonable to say for the better part of a year, you had been conducting an affair with miss drake.
your honor...
answer the question.
we're in love.
how very nice for you.
do you own a motorcycle?
Yes.
it's a late model torque speedster?
Yes.
you should have it checked for oil leaks.
riding a motorcycle can be potentially dangerous?
I suppose.
I'm curious... your wife, lucy, did she ride?
no.
but you had some reason to be concerned for her health or welfare.
no.
why then did you take out a half a million dollar life insurance policy in her name two weeks before she died.
if anyone in the family was high risk, it would be you, mr. Samuel'S.
I thought that-- if you notice the time stamp on one of the photographs, november 18th, the night before the fire.
let me ask you something, mr. Samuel'S.
you claim to be in love with miss drake.
objection.
overruled.
you meet for an amorous evening the night before your wife dies in the fire.
two weeks earlier, you take out an insurance policy for half million dollars in her name.
objection.
overruled.
are you psychic mr. Samuel'S... or do things just have a way of working out for you?
your honor!
you set the fire that killed your wife, didn't you?
No!
in fact, you set all the fires hoping to cover up what you did, isn't that true, mr. Samuel's?
Richard, don't!
the hell with you!
Ah!
Ahhhhhhh!
case closed you sonuvabitch.
sometimes you have to lose something to gain something.
this time, we almost lost Connor.
I suppose what I've gained is the realization that, as much as I try to avoid it, we are a team.
and when push comes to shove we stand beside each other.
some of us might even like each other.
what's this?
no champagne?
he is cute, isn't he?
warm bottled water and a briefing in 10 minutes.
welcome back!
Thanks.
Hey, -hey.
hell, this was easy time.
maybe for you.
I had to teach these guys logic.
welcome back.
how's stanley?
nothing major.
vasco did a pretty good job of saving his hide.
you ask me, he'd do a damn good impersonation of a crispy critter.
glad to have you back.
well, that's so easy to say, darlin'.
actions speak a whole lot louder than words, oh yeah, he's back.
one, big happy family.
you got ten minutes learn it well.
pictures didn't do any justice.
I sense danger. - It's fine. I'm fine.
were you car sick?
of course I wasn't car sick.
that's why I ...
Richard, I'm not sure you fully understand that you're walking into here, there are killness.
I know.
I can handle this. Would you please, just give me some credit.
it's not gonna be quiet.
I'm having trouble believing how great this is.
are you coming?
Oh, good Lord!
Claire?
Oh, poor thing.
at least it was quick.
it was a clean cut throat tear.
you should give him a proper burial.
I feel just like I lost my parents.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, this is charming.
all the wire works. Good.
I do not know if the stove works.
maybe they have take-out menus.
Oh, listen! Come here, come here. Come here.
there she is. The moan of sea.
still in there.
Wow! Yeah.
that's so...
Oh, they got plenty of towels.
we didn't need to bring any.
Oh well ...
the fuse box is in the leaning closet, Richard.
Oh, star lights. Richard?
the couch. It could be a problem.
do not fix it.
you're right.
wonderful! Everything. - Good okay
you want to grab the luggage out of the car?
I'll do it.
Phil Turley is very concerned, Claire, about the community's efforts to protect the nesting ground.
so it should be.
listen, I put all my numbers on the top sheet of that memory pat by the telephone, so if you wanna tear that off and tape it off somewhere.
I'm in surgery from nine until noon, so I'll check you in after that. OK?
great. Good.
are you sure you do not want rent a car?
didn't they say there was a bike?
I think it's under the garage.
it's ten minutes to town. It's no big deal.
okay. It is up to you.
so, what is your schedule look like for tomorrow?
I'll start at the very beginning.
it is a very good place to start.
speaking of which ...
close your eyes.
OK. Can open them.
Oh! - Marc just got one of these.
he said a five-year-old could use it.
Richard, easy words.
actually, I was thinking writing on the Corona.
Oh! - No, but this is good.
this is ...no, you're right. This is... This is better.
okay.
Richard? Easy to handle this
Oh, I talked to Peter and Lucy and they said they might come out the weekend the second.
great, great!
who? - Peter and Lucy?
Oh, good, yeah. They are always fun.
Yeah, yeah.
you didn't bring... You didn't um... bring him out here, did you?
what? No. No, of course not.
okay.
all right
have a productive week, OK?
save some lives!
R-No Pressure Love, C - Any news? - Let go of me.
do you remember the time you and I we took a neighbor's bicycle a little fluph?
no, I do not. No. Will you let me go?
we both know that I'm not gonna quit the deal under these circumstances until you prove otherwise I feel compelled to be on hands.
can you step aside? I have things to do.
I sense danger.
would you stop saying that.
be careful!
aren't you a cheerleader, anyway?
I'm not.
you can so easy to be a cheerleader.
you can so easily drop dead.
Oh!
No! No! Not like that.
hands soap? Oh!
no. It's for your wheels.
the squeak drives me nuts.
it's a nice bike, though.
used to have one of these when I was young age.
so, how com you following me?
I'm not.

I mean, as lonely as ever, I called on months you know just until I ...
my parents thought of ...
I don't know.
I never told them.
never ...
told anyone else.
that was a pact.
me and Amy were both there to go.
enter the water and she didn't...
didn't swim back.
I swam back.
I could ...I could...
I do not know what we were so unhappy about. I mean ...
how could we be so unhappy about ...
I think you ...you are too young to know you can get over anything.
he's always made poor decisions.

Oh, Christ, it's got to be over 40 years.
second grade.

monsters under the bed, a cheerleader, governor...
these days have not been the right time to tell him the truth.
and you?
I'm crazy in love with her.
Oh! Tough one. - Yeah.
it's been hurry.
I think She's almost done with me.

captain Excellent. - Christopher.

Oh!

son of bitch!

what? What is this? Richard
who is that? Who the fuck is that?
she is the babysitter.
get out. Get out.
get out!
Hi, Lucy! Hi, Peter!
hi
Claire, we'll just be ...
I did not sleep with the babysitter, if that's what you think of.
Oh, that is so comforting.
why do we even have a babysitter?
it was just a kegger, Claire. That was all.
just a kegger?
and with whom exactly did you have a kegger?
just kids from high school .
Richard, just stop.
none of this is ok. -ok
you knew we were coming this weekend.
why are you doing this?
I've been a bit at a loss.
what a bullshit answer.
I was being flandering and Abby was being ...
what? Abby was being what?
a friend.
for God's sake, that is not a friend, that's a child.
you do have friends. - No, I do not.
I think that is a touble here...
cause you do not have a relate to other human beings.
Yeah, you isolate yourself.
Oh, you can talk.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
you can be cold, Claire.
I think we just get out of here.
we just get out of here leave this area.
where? - I do not know, anywhere.
I don't know if it's your profession or what... you know, but it makes your heart.
I cannot and I don't accept that.
I wanna to have a baby
is that what this is all about?
we could have a baby, Claire.
why did not we have a baby? Why?
because you're a baby.
you're an enfant.
you still have an imaginary friend.
I just wanted a little warm thing.
something simple I could start with.
a simple relationship with a person that was new and pure.
well, I could be me, they could be them.
and that's all I've expected we can build.
in this world there's someone other than me to think about and be about.
and the relief of being able to give the world to someone else and let it be there and let them have their turn.
so it doesn't end with me.
well that's all you, Where do I come in?
what do you mean?
God, you're the mother.
Ah, I am so sorry, guys.
we are gonna go we're just gonna go...
we can be just anywhere Anywhere.
I'm so sorry.- No no no. All right.
we're just going out -I will walk you out, I'm sorry
wish you all go on a crew or something
okay.
okay. Take care.
alright. if we are gonna do this, let's ...
alright, by the way, what's she like? like 13, 14?
at least we'll get the fact straight.
it was you, Richard. You didn't want to have a baby.
you weren't ready.
so that little fuzzy fucking speech my friends had to hear was bull shit.
now, I know that I'm... I can't.
so I guess I am the bad guy.
no not the novel that's...
I'd rather you didn't...
what is this? What is this?
that's it.
after all this time out here and this is it?
this is that?
maybe you should spent more time working instead of ...
fucking the babysitter.
no. I. . - You're useless. -Yes - You are totally useless! - Yes. I am.
what is wrong with you?
I do not know what to do with my hands.
everyone.
Janeth, my sister and Olive all have been made
I have the one who made me laugh.
what happened?
I do not know what happened.
you stopped laughing.
may I help you? - Yeah.
I came here to pay my respects.
sorry? - Heath Hen, the North American Heath Hen...
it's where the last one lived and died.
I don't know anything about the Heath Hen.
but you are welcome to look around.
we've got several varieties of proper.
thank you.
so that is what the end of something looks like.
the world went on, Richard.
but never the same.
we do not know how much it changes things.
but it is just being here.
the ripple of the fact.
if the chicken hadn't died out here, you will be perfectly adusted.
maybe.
doubtful.
instead of a child, I am a loser and I am condemned to believe in Captain.
it's like a little hand.
it's ...It's time for you to go.
no.
you know what I am saying, Captain.
I mean, go and never come back.
I'm not ready.
it doesn't matter.
you can not help me anymore.
the doctor is right.
but You will be alone.
Yes, as the last of my kind.
OK.
do the voice.
one last time.
please.
when the world is peril.
when evil surrounds you.
when danger is lurking.
who do you call?
captain Excellent!
I wish I had a really amazing and vital father like him.
captain?
Richmond regarded his solitude... The ...
Merton regarded his solitude ... Norton regarded his solitude ...
Horton regarded his solitude ...Norton thought ...
norwood regarded his solitude...The ...
Richard? Richard?
Richard!
richard regarded his solitude as something sacred.
I had dreams last night and uh. .
you were in it.
ah? Was it interesting?
you were you.
you're leaving, aren't you?
Yeah, you know, because of the - situation ...
Yeah.
I figured it.
you know, spring is ...
my favorite time.
cause summer has not arrived yet.
and it's not fucking cold.
uh ... I. .
I made something for you.
it is the swan.
the beautiful and graceful swan.
it's ...Richard, it's perfect.
yeah
thank you.
it seems like that we were just come started.
take care.
okay.
okay
I am a horse's ass.
Yes, you are.
I am sorry.
I kind of need some help to get this couch in.
richard regarded his solitude as something sacred.
as well as a badge of honor.
a clock to be warned of warm to life
as well as safety.
solitude is who he was.
this cast those into his lives to make him feel barely content.
richard was certain that there was not lined.
it was just hard on man.
maybe it was because he gave nothing and he received nothing in return.
in any case, the situation became untolerable.
the closed things he had as his friends were either imaginary or extinct.
richard had reached a point in his life but it was no longer enough.
and then he met a girl.
and she was warm.
and she was sad.
and she was maybe lonely in a way that reminded him of himself.
she lost things that no girl had lost.
and she knew things.
and she taught him.
and Richard thought maybe that was what friendship feels like.
maybe.
it was just in the blinks.
it barely began really.
but in those long few winter days.
she gave him so much.
enough so that Richard could go on.
and what did he give her?
just a few words on a page.
not much, perhaps.
but for Abby.
he hoped that was enough.
okay.
bengal. O'golden beauty...
...we love you.
1962, Calcutta.
a city of rickshaws and trams.
evenings spent in 'The Coffee House'.
a city hungry for social change.
undying in its faith in Goddess Kali.
tantalizing with its spicy treats.
from the bounce of the football to the bustle of bazaars.
a city of political debates...
...obsessed with reform.
a city of joy and love.
Lolita and Shekhar's city.
and tonight the city celebrates
Shekhar's marriage to Gayatri, daughter of Shyamlal Tantiya.
son of and only heir to the city's rich and famous industrialist Navin Rai...
...the managing director of Rai Constructions,
Shekhar Rai.
Shekhar. Shekhar.
behold the handsome groom.
a couplet in your honour
they will sigh... some even die...
...as tonight you look... quite dashing.'
how do I look?
quit staring. Just say I look like a freak.
congratulations, sir. My lady has requested you to come.
if possible please come.
go meet her.
aunt's here. I better run. Hurry up.
lady... you and your tales ...some sweet, some tall,
they're endless. Some outright fake.
here's the story of the bride and groom.
he was a simpleton, she in full bloom.
her beauty had travelled far and wide...
...made the hearts of many burn with spite.
but how did they meet?
tell us the tale of the wedding night.
please tell us.
God knows what possessed the bride...
...locked the door and sulked inside.
the puzzled groom knocked the door silly.
thought - 'This the end of my story.'
my darling, don't torture me this way...
...please tell me the follies of my way.
his friends then explained...
what did they say?
want her back? Be sweet, be false.
only then will your queen agree.
do you want the moon and stars, my bride? '
she said, 'Could you be more trite? '
my life is yours to keep,' he said...
consider it over, it's so cheap.'
so how did they meet?
tell us the tale of the wedding night.
he came to me, I said
what good are stars, silly boy? '
armed with my magic words,
he went over to her, not so coy.
what did he say?
I've brought you silver and gold.'
she said, 'The door's now half unbolt.'
I have brought diamonds and pearls with me, my queen.
the bride then opened the door.
aunt Vasundhara.
you're here, son?
what's happening? Even your uncle...
Girish handled everything.
a son-in-law like him is a blessing.
he is more than a son.
he is our backbone now.
he wanted to meet you.
what happened then? Please tell me.
meet him and go, he's on his way...
some other time, aunt.
OK. I'll ask him to look you up.
good bye, aunt.
Bye. Oh. Congratulations.
Shekhar.
leaving already?
without meeting me?
can't you even look at me?
heard you're getting married tonight?
have you forgotten me completely?
don't want to see me, meet me，even touch me?
maybe you do want to touch...
you're shameless. Married women don't utter such things.
it's because I'm married...
I feel no shame, no fear, just...
stop it Lolita. I'm not Girish... I know the real you.
and who am I? Tell me...
a shameless betrayer, pretending to be a faithful and innocent wife.
that's what you are.
have you composed this?
no, it's Tagore's, stupid.
Koel, who's this?
Lolita. Her parents died in a car accident...
...now she stays with us.
Hey, Koel. There's some fresh tamarind pickle for you.
Tamarind?
Lolita, have some too.
no. I don't eat pickle.
OK.
but I wouldn't mind some mango pickle.
so still is my heart's beat...
...aching to hear the bells of your feet.
my life has lost its melody...
...my songs are mute with defeat.
from dusk until dawn, your memory rules my mind.
why does my hand seek yours?
were you ever mine?
tell me... tell me... tell me...
the flowers see the bee swing, like your vision in my mind.
trees hear the nightingale sigh, 'I long, I yearn, to make you mine'
how much? - Twenty five paise.
I don't want it.
show me...
not bad. Why were you returning it, stupid?
no money.
you need money, right?
Oh, boy. Come.
here's my pocket money - take it anytime.
there's no need to ask anyone.
not even you?
no. Need any now?
no.
here, keep the keys.
how long will this dreary night last?
tell me...
how can I erase our past?
tell me...
Lolita. Come up. - Coming.
will my arms find you again?
will your perfume fill me again?
will your love ever ebb away?
were our bonds made of clay?
from dusk until dawn...
...your memory rules my mind.
why does my hand seek yours?
were you ever mine?
see, Lolita is wearing a sari.
not bad.
hey Lolita.
what happened? - Came first in my class.
then come up immediately.
coming...
so what do you want?
a small statue of Lord Krishna, for your room.
my room?
so?
Shekhar.
the flowers see the bee swing, like your vision in my mind.
trees hear the nightingale sigh, 'I long, I yearn, to make you mine'
flowers see the bee swing, like your vision in my mind.
trees hear the nightingale sigh, 'I long, I yearn, to make you mine'
Shekhar.
hurry up and get dressed, the prayer is about to start.
Hey, you'll get burnt. - So will you.
Hey, Lolita.
come up, I've got a new tune.
hang on. I've just come back.
why fret, Mr. Gurucharan?
you own a palatial house...
this house is a gold mine, a treasure.
tell you what - sell it and buy a modest place.
unthinkable. My grandfather had built this house with so much love...
...you could see it from anywhere.
Hello, sir.
hello.
and... in any case its mortgaged.
Mortgaged?
since when?
three years back when I got a heart attack...
...Navin Rai lent me 100, 000 rupees... just like that.
but your home is worth at least two million?
navin Rai though a gentleman, is also a businessman.
when the interest added upto 150, 000 rupees...
...the house had to be mortgaged.
I've promised to repay by 30th November...
...I really need that extension on my job.
Mr. Jones has made up his mind... its over.
this is your final pay package.
exactly 10, 809 rupees.
see you. No, I really must go.
thanks and all the best.
Lolita. Lolita.
mom.
why isn't she here yet?
she'll get here.
who asked her to get a job? She's obsessed with her office now.
see you soon.
mom.
you asked your father to employ her.
Lolita.
later... Shekhar's calling.
but we need the cake tomorrow. OK, tell me.
Koel, you're so stubborn...
sis-in-law won't accept any other recipe.
now tell me...
Lolita. - See?
corn flour?
200 grams. He's just so impatient.
yeah... next.
what next? I'll have to go now...
I am talking about the recipe, come on tell me.
what's next after chocolate powder?
spoon Vanilla, 200 grams butter...
he must be sulking now.
I'm off.
the cake...? Sis?
we need eggs, right? - In what?
your head... Shekhar, Shekhar, Shekhar.
such an expensive pen?
must have blown your paycheck.
Nope. I have fifty paise left.
play the tune.
I don't know...
you are mine...
say you are mine...
nice.
thank you.
put some words to it.
the lover said something, so did the lass alas.
I do not know.
my heart sways gently, ever so slow, but why it sways,
I do not know.
not bad. Hear this...
matters of the heart, the heart of the matter...
...should always be locked in the heart.
my lips are sealed, with bolts and keys...
...but through my eyes my love is revealed.
the lover said something, so did the lass
what they said, alas.
I do not know
my heart sways gently, ever so slow, but why it sways,
I do not know.
the lover said something, so did the lass what they said, alas.
I do not know
my heart sways gently, ever so slow, but why it sways,
I do not know.
now imagine - A girl, a little cranky, a bit mad...
you know, like you.
Really? - And a boy.
bright as a star? - No. Madder than she.
how else would they fall in love?
one day, in the church...
I once asked a river, 'Where do you scurry to, silly? '
far is your sweetheart's dwelling .why do you spiral hither and thither? '
a trifle bashful, a wee bit fearful...
...she skipped, she tripped, she leaped.
all she cared was to rush to her lover...
just like me, my dear.
my heart sways gently, ever so slow, but why it sways,
I do not know.
the lover said something, so did the lass what they said, alas.
I do not know
my heart sways gently, ever so slow, but why it sways,
I do not know.
I once asked a cloud, dense with rain, 'Where are you floating to, silly? '
can't you see this parched landscape?
descend on it regally.'
she shivered a little, quaked some more, she yawned a mighty, mighty roar.
then she poured on me, a rain of love ...just like you, my dear.
the lover said something, so did the lass what they said, alas.
I do not know
my heart sways gently,
never so slow, but why it sways,
I do not know.
the lover said something, so did the lass what they said, alas.
I do not know
my heart sways gently,
never so slow, but why it sways,

that's for sure.
we'll handle the rest at the recording.
I've taken a hundred.
so?
for the pen. Do the math.
have you gone crazy?
with my head for numbers?
lts all about numbers. The concession we get is our profit.
you can't give it away to those people.
but uncle... I mean, sir, profiting from a charitable hospital is important.
they're charitable, not me.
know this. A profitless deal is a bad one.
got it?
Yes, sir.
hello. Yes, Rajeshwari...
you know we have to go in the evening.
what?
it's Shekhar's marriage, not mine.
won't see the girl.'
has he given any thought to his future?
a girl from such an illustrious family is hard to find.
Gayathri is Lala Shyamlal Tantiya's daughter.
enough. He has to be ready in the evening.
and you... no, forget it.
don't want to see the girl.'
where were we?
a profitless deal is a bad one.'
stop fretting needlessly. Has Navin Rai asked for anything?
and what if he does?
can we suddenly produce that kind of cash?
even you, Vasundhara...
a gentleman like him would never do such a thing.
and we know him for decades...
sir, I'm in a bit of a rush.
lets go.
any problem, sir?
nothing. Please sit.
this year we want less drummers for the festival.
what?
three are enough.
what? The whole colony comes here to celebrate...
I know, but times are hard.
but Mrs. Rai has already paid for the arrangements.
she wants it to be grand...
I've even got an advance.
she's already paid? - Yes. I told you, stop fretting needlessly.
hello.
hello.
Shekhar had sent word for you...
OK.
heard you've got a job now, dear?
Yes, sir.
then I expect a present this festival...
sure.
I take your leave.
amazing. They've already paid.
why tell me? I told you.
Lolita, freshen up quickly.
Why?
because without you Calcutta stops functioning.
has sis returned?
there you go. - Now what?
their cake isn't ready.
Charu has called for you ten times for the cake.
Shekhar's sent word twenty times.
shall I cut myself into two?
three. What will I do without you?
four. Sis-in-law's cake needs you.
no, five. What about your uncle?
Hey, six. For me.
Oh. We forgot about Shekhar.
awful weather upstairs?
tempers are soaring.
stop drooling.
has to meet a girl, but he's still on the piano.
please help him, or your uncle...
and why have you come so late?
just fifteen minutes late.
a minute's delay from you ruins the schedule of this house.
now run.
Lolita will light up the house she marries into.
Yes.
she will go to a house where she's appreciated...
...not where she's a namesake mistress.
not ready yet?
don't you want to see the girl?
I could die.
does the entire city know? I don't want to meet any girl.
dad's so stubborn.
navin uncle.
grow up Lolita, it's not even funny.
please pick out a decent shirt from my crappy wardrobe.
God. Such fuss.
here.
Wow. When did I buy this shirt?
navin uncle got it for you from London.
amazing. I didn't even know it existed.
like many other things you have. Oh.
navin uncle.
not again Lolita.
Shekhar. Aren't you ready yet?
I'm ready father. Let's go.
hurry up.
run.
Shekhar. - Coming, father.
good evening, Mr. Tantiya.
hello.
my son, Shekhar.
silly oaf.
you've got a cake load of flour and sugar on you.
and here's a raisin for the icing.
never think of baking another cake.
just pray this third cake works...
can you smell that? - What?
something's burning.
Oh my God. Cake.
Koel, stand back... careful.
take the plug out.
this cake is resting in pieces.
shut up.
Oh dear.
how our hearts baked for you...
what happened? - It's about to a fourth cake, by you.
thank God, you're here.
now we won't get egg on our face in front of Girish.
not egg... cake.
who?
my brother Girish is coming from London tonight.
he loves my homemade cakes.
yours...
are you ready...?
still baking?
no, burning.
shut up. You two get cleaned up.
sis-in-law, relax. I'll handle this.
thank you. OK, listen...
Yes, I've got your purse.
OK. And have you...
Yes, I've filled the petrol.
can we leave now? - Of course. Stop chatting.
take care of the cake and the pudding... and shut the door.
hello. I'm Gayatri Tantiya.
hello. I'm... Shekhar.
I know.
I'd forgotten who I was for a second.
happy birthday by the way...
thank you.
did you know Shekhar's a musician?
hopefully it'll remain an interest.
Hi, Shekhar.
Hi, Sidharth.
where is your drink?
sis, you haven't even asked him. Come on...
I will fix you a drink.
Navin, let Shekhar and Sidharth handle the Darjeeling Tea estate deal.
we've done our bit. Let them handle this.
I like that even more. What do you play?
piano.
did I say something funny?
just remembered my piano lessons.
do you play too? - No.
tried to. Not me, my tutors did.
one after the other, all seven fled.
cowards. Tonight could have been your concert performance.
but I'd have missed meeting you.
ladies and gentlemen, the cake is about to be cut...
happy birthday to you.
hello. Please send someone to 56, Bagh Bazaar.
we have no electricity.
now that was a piece of cake.
like it? I made it.
enjoy yourselves... - Really?
are you mad? It's from Fluries. I can't even boil water.
but don't worry, dad has promised to send 6 cooks with me when I get married.
is that ok with you? Or should we ask for twelve?
one to boil water, one for tea and one for cake.
are you serious?
coming.
stop breaking the door.
here so fast?
Yes. Thought I'd surprise them. And you are...?
Yes, I'd called for the electrician.
electrician?
I plugged in the oven and... poof. It blew.
are you going to fix it telepathically?
what happened?
the fuse has blown.
this way.
what's this?
Suitc... I mean the toolbox.
tools for any contingency.
here's the fuse box.
hold this.
Oh, no. - Is it bad?
very. Flour all over. - On the fuse?
hold still...
now it's ok. Got any wire?
shouldn't you have it?
this pin will do.
your hair looks much better open.
got a hammer?
hammer?
need to break the wall to check the wiring.
God. This is going to be a long process.
a long affair, yes. Could be a week, even ten days.
but I'm ready. Can you open the tool box?
this? - That's the shaving kit. Man's gotta shave.
look, mister...
can't see in the dark. Could you hold the candle up?
much better.
do you think this is an easy profession?
I have to travel to America, Japan... just back from London.
they all know me by name...
there you are.
we've been waiting for you at the airport.
and you're standing on top here.
come on, sis.
how are you?
Hello, brother. Did she ask you to stand there?
no, it was the fuse...
the fuse had blown, sis.
and the cake?
then?
I told the Britisher, 'I'm not here to work in the steel plant'
... l'm here to buy it.' We know. Eat some cake.
of course. He was shocked.
you finally learnt how to bake, sis.
Thanks.
then?
then I bought it my first steel plant.
and the rest, as they say, is history.
he's made a habit of buying steel plants.
have you come to buy one this time too?
Nope. This time I've come especially to... fix a fuse.
just kidding. I've come here for two reasons.
to find a Managing Partner for my new project and...
...to help Charu find her life partner.
brother...
he needs to see her once in candlelight...
...love at first sight. Then eat this cake and set a date.
this must happen in your London. Marriages aren't a game here.
you're right. What say, sis?
game? There's one game in which I rule...
...can even beat my foreign-returned brother.
which one?
have you ever really won that game?
I can, if Lolita plays with me.
I warn you, sis, I've become a quite a champ myself.
Oh.
you don't know Lolita then...
try me...
Really? Challenge?
challenge.
I knew you would drag cards in somehow.
so tomorrow afternoon we wreck a deck.
afternoon? I have work.
evening then after work.
how was the girl, son?
alright.
come on, describe her... tall, thin...?
mom, she was like girls are.
morning.
Lolita, why don't you ask him about the girl?
he doesn't tell me anything.
so?
pandit Nehru has said that in the UN general assembly tomorrow...
good looking?
pandit Nehru?
did you meet him last night? Is Gayatri Tantiya very beautiful?
didn't notice anything... nothing special.
what was she wearing?
sort of a gown... very English... nice dress.
color?
pink, slightly dark, you know, off shoulder.
and she was wearing a beady... 'choker', right?
maybe, but then you weren't noticing.
and her heels? You'd fall if you wore them.
why can't I wear heels?
they're just not you. Besides why would you wear them?
what I can or can't do is beyond you.
Hey, I'm just saying that I've never seen you wear them.
what you haven't seen before isn't impossible.
where are you going? What about my song?
my heels will work on them.
listen... - Need to get to work. Bye.
come back quickly, sis.
hello.
if I finish I'll come.
make some excuse.
will try.
please, sis. You know sis-in-law is miserable at cards.
we'll lose without you.
sis? Why are you wearing my heels? You'll break them.
I told you.
be careful...
Hey, Lolitha. Looking lovely today. Nice heels, man.
Thanks. How was the holiday?
great.
what the hell. Clumsy girl.
sorry, sir.
are you picking them or spying?
no sir, I'm just... - Shut up.
got your morning dose.
bam. We bumped and papers flew... Careful. Your table is scary.
no tea for you, right?
no.
Thanks.
what's this Heritage Hotel project, uncle?
heritage Hotel? Never heard of it? Has anyone said anything?
no. Read it on top of a file I dropped.
what was written?
did you see anything else?
how could I? He grabbed it.
that's 'Hitler Rai'.
I better run before I get an 'overdose'.
Hey, are you taking a tonic these days?
no
grown tall overnight.
chatterjee Uncle...
checked the track lay?
OK.
the lover said something, I do not know what they said, alas.
so did the lass
my heart sways gently, ever so slow
but why it sways, I do not know.
I once asked a river, 'Far, too far, is your lover's abode... '
no, no.
I'll tell them, relax. Listen up...
far, too far, is your lover's abode... '
have you written this?
I've written what I remember of Lolita's lyrics.
where is she?
God knows. Am I her secretary?
but you gave her the date and time, right?
Yes.
should've taken an appointment...
...sent an invitation card to her highness.
just one Saridon, and say goodbye to headaches.
so should we play another turn?
how do I know?
just one more turn and...
... goodbye to headaches.'
and here's Lolita.
welcome, please join us.
so late? We're losing miserably.
sorry.
I'm so tired of my lucky streak, sis.
shut up, Lucky.
he's bluffing.
bluff?
Koel, show me your cards.
now what?
nothing.
one more turn.
are you sure?
of course.
think twice. The loser will...
what?
take us all to Moulin Rouge.
Moulin Rouge.
no. The Coffee House.
how boring.
one minute. Are you scared of nightclubs?
or are you not confident?
none at all.
rubbish. Lolita, say something.
and what if you lose?
breakfast at Fluries for all.
Fluries. Yeah...
hold on. Let me make myself clear... - I'm not losing.
of course.
sir, what if instead of the 'ocean', the stream meets a 'boat'?
sir, please sing what's been written.
but it's contrary to the meter.
who's the music director here?
you, sir.
then please sing.
chill. He's very senior.
sir, lets decide what the stream meets later.
show your hand.
already? Where's the confidence?
we're confident, not overconfident.
come on, show.
OK. So here's my first jack. Now you.
Hey, I asked for the show of hand.
I've bared my soul here, and you can't show me a card?
here's our second jack.
a pair of jacks? - Now your show.
just a pair.
they've lost. Colour. Fluries. Fluries.
one minute.
you don't know my third card yet.
here's my third jack.
which means - Moulin Rouge.
you weren't bluffing?
I never bluff.
then?
just plain lucky.
the recording date won't come to her in her dream?
aren't you the arranger?
for music, not meetings. You should've spoken to her...
if I've to say everything, then I will.
right... Pack up, please.
if I have to do all the talking, then hear this...
sir, pack up.
but why?
why didn't you tell Uncle if you didn't want to see the girl?
because he would've dug a hole right then, and buried me.
point.
how is Gayatri though?
Why? Interested?
good heavens, no. She is my sister-in-law.
you always play this wrong.
always?
so sue me. Hang me.
look, if you're going to vent Lolita's anger on me...
speak of the devil... Lolita.
and who's the guy?
handsome, isn't he?
my foot. Wears a suit and eats puchkas.
where was he when the British were leaving?
take it easy, man.
the heart sways, Why? I don't know why.
out. - Why?
get down.
but...
out.
I've got no money to get home.
sir, a penny. Just a penny would help.
can I borrow a penny from you? Please, just one.
no way. Scram.
I've taken 200 rupees.
we're going to Moulin Rouge because I lost a bet.
who's we?
Koel, Charu, Girish, sis-in-law...
Girish who?
Sis-in-law's brother from London.
owns huge steel plants, but so simple...
I'm sure it was Sir Girish's idea to bet.
do you know how he got his first steel plant?
so now you know his life history.
maybe that's why you missed the recording.
recording? When?
what do you care? Cards, puckhas, night clubs...
so Koel told you about it.
and you've started hiding things.
but I'm telling you now.
after dressing up, just before you leave?
tell me, should I not go? - Please do.
just don't pretend to 'ask'.
sir Girish awaits your presence.
Shekhar, why are you...?
just go.
I knew the plan would be ruined.
why does this always happen?
speak softly, Koel ...my head's pounding.
shall I massage it?
come on, sis. Can I get you a pill?
I'll get it for you.
here. Come on sis, we won't get this chance again.
you guys go ahead. - I'm really feeling ill.
keep some money.
they're here. Sure you want to me go?
go. - See you then.
have the medicine, sis.
Where's everybody?
right here. - Where's Lolita?
she said she'll come later. Headache.
what are you wearing?
if she's very ill let's cancel this. - Yes.
no. This is normal. She'll be fine. Let's go.
are you sure? - Even Lolita has asked us to carry on.
I think we should continue. - Yes.
should we? - Let's go.
come on... - OK.
Oh my, a halter neck? Aunty let you wear it?
no, these questions aren't new.
they are as old as time.
what is this riddle called life?
can you block it can you stop that which flows?
what is this riddle called life?
take a sip, give in to its powers...
...and find laughter in your tears.
it makes you laugh,
it makes you wail,
all in a moment, this strange tale.
what is this riddle called life?
can you block it can you stop that which flows?
what is this riddle called life?
like a twinkle in the eye...
...your tear turns into a pearl.
like a beautiful boulevard of trees, on a lonely long road.
what is this riddle called life?
can you block it can you stop that which flows?

no, these questions aren't new.
they are as old as time.
what is this riddle called life?
can you block it can you stop that which flows?

Bye. - Be good.
Thanks, Girish. I'm sorry about messing up your shirt.
better than your messed up character.
Oh, shut up.
wine stains are stubborn.
speak softly, sis.
careful.
you're early. Thought you had a late night?
Yeah, it was a bit late.
and tonight?
cards, night club... or something new?
I'll think about it.
I've found Elvis' new LP. Good morning, Lolita.
Lolita, come here.
why weren't you at the recording?
I would've come, had some one taken the effort to tell me about it.
I knew it.
Ajit, she's busy entertaining tourists.
you see, she's still under colonial rule.
completely false.
it's like the saying- We dare sigh...
...for fear of slander, but they get away with murder.'
brilliant.
OK, Shakespeare. Ask her where she...
hang on. Why don't I leave and let you two fight.
sorry, Ajit.
I'll forgive you only when I have the whole song.
haven't you heard? - What?
I'm busy entertaining tourists.
actually he's quite handsome. Anything on?
maybe.
Bye, Ajit.
what's up with her?
you tell me... she was talking to you.
come in.
uncle, you have the blueprints of the hospital, right?
[Laughter]
you are getting a rare glimpse
at this exclusive, government-only event.
each December, one department puts on a show
that spoofs what happened in our town.
prepare to laugh your asnov!
[Chuckles]
Sid asnov is a former city councilman.
some of the jokes are sort of inside.
councilman dexhart,
you're involved in yet another scandal?
that's crazier than mayor gunderson's dog rufus.
[Laughter]
Yes, there is a new one, and it's a doozy.
I don't want to go into the details,
but let me just say that it involves multiple women,
a love child, nurses, rabbis, priests.
[Laughter]
well, I hope you can all join me
at my fundraiser tonight.
I am being supported, of course,
by the glitter factory and 1-800-mattress.
[Laughter]
ha ha ha ha! Classic.
Pawnee is a city that ain't very pretty and good government is our goal - we may not be big and our mayor wears a wig but at least the raccoon infestation is under control - [all] it's the most wonderful time in pawnee [cheers and applause]
lot 48 was once a horrible and disgusting pit.
and now it's the site of pawnee's winter wonderland.
this could not be more perfect if I had planned it myself.
which I did. And it's awesome.
so let's talk schedge, guys.
the kids are gonna come at 9: 00 a. M. On Saturday,
and everyone's gonna do santa for two hours.
so I would just advise everyone
before you get in your costume
to go to the bathroom so we can avoid what happened last year.
it was just farts.
6: 00 p. M. caroling with the youth choir.
and I am proud to announce, for the first time ever,
this year our tree-lighting ceremony
will be simulcast on internet radio.
thank you.
that's a really big deal. - It is. Thank you.
listening to that tree lighting's gonna be dope!
okay, any questions, direct them to me--dismissed.
Hey, uh, there was a message for you
on the work voicemail.
councilman dexhart wants to meet with you
at 9: 00 p. M.-- The boardwalk lounge.
shut up. - No.
I'm not scared. I got nothing to apologize for.
I could have been a lot harder on him.
he got off easy.
and often.
[Chuckles]
thank you. I'll be here all week.
you gotta tell me about him. I don't know anything about him.
okay, he's 23, he's kinda my boyfriend.
he's gay.
last year we got drunk and he took me to the ice capades,
and I didn't get him anything.
and he's gay? - Yeah.
Brokeback mountain dvd.
no. - Fellas love that.
no.
does he already have, like, chaps?
like, assless chaps? - You know what, forget it.
okay, uh, why are you asking me?
because, I don't know, there's no one else to ask.
and at least you're kind of young.
all right, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna think about it.
through the course of all day I'm gonna mull it over.
it's all I'm gonna think about. But you're in good hands.
I'm gonna come up with something really, really good.
Really? - Yeah.
all right. - You got that?
Yeah. Thanks.
councilman dexhart, I'm leslie knope.
thank you for meeting me. - It's my pleasure.
I am assuming this is about my performance
in the government follies last night.
I'd just like to say that I have nothing to apologize for.
except for perhaps being too incisive.
I don't want you to apologize.
I want to know who told you.
who told me? - Mm-hmm.
nobody. Nobody told me nuttin'!
what are we talking about?
well, based on that skit,
I know you've heard about the new scandal
that's about to break.
who told you?
was it the babysitter?
was it the nurse who delivered our love child?
what? - Oh, stop playing dumb.
you know damn well what happened.
I got the babysitter pregnant.
then, when she was in the delivery room,
I had sex with not one
but four nurses in a supply closet.
as well as a woman whose husband
was getting a liver transplant.
hmm.
now, which one of them told you?
was it the liver lady?
well, I--no one-- I haven't
I haven't heard any of this ever in my whole life.
Oh.
believe me, I would have remembered this.
okay. Well, in that case,
everything I just told you was just a funny prank.
[Chuckles]
Oh, hi. How was your meeting?
it was fine.
pretty straightforward.
short meeting. You know, he's a busy guy.
Yes, very busy. Look at this article.
No!
what the
the story of this story is that it won't stop developing.
the mystery woman who met with councilman dexhart last night
appears to be a government employee named leslie norp.
Oh, my god. Oh, god.
according to unconfirmed reports in the pawnee sun,
the two bent an elbow at this local watering hole.
and although they left separately,
no one knows where they woke up together.
perd hapley, channel 4 news.
all I did was write and perform in one amazing skit.
Leslie, it's the pawnee sun.
it's a tabloid.
nobody else has written about it.
Yeah, no one believes that garbage.
nobody even reads that thing.
Leslie, what? Nice work, girl.
Oh, god.
how do I fight back? Give me some options.
do you want me to seduce perd hapley?
how would that help?
I don't know.
I just want to see if I can do it.
april, I appreciate that, but I don't think it's something
worth losing your virginity over.
Leslie, I don't know if this is important or not,
but I have heard a lot of very, very interesting chatter
around the shoeshine stand today.
Oh, my god, really?
what have you heard? - A lot of things.
uh, like, "can you believe it?
and "the parks lady boned dexhart.
and "of course she did. She's totally good to go.
and one guy was like, "I wouldn't hit that.
and the other guy was like, "me neither.
then this third guy was like, "I would.
so I don't know if that's helpful at all.
well, keep your ear to the ground.
okay. I'll just
I'm not gonna let these people intimidate me.
I'm gonna do my job.
I would be lying if I said that I never thought
I would be involved in an incident like this.
except I always assumed that I would be the politician,
and the man would be accused of sleeping with me.
and that man would be the vice president.
and I would be the president.
okay, all right, well, you look good.
you need to put some tights on, though.
and I want you to make sure you keep your neckline
nice and high.
Leslie knope? Alexa softcastle, pawnee sun.
can I ask you a few questions?
don't say anything.
I'm not afraid to say anything, okay?
I have nothing to hide.
I've never even met councilman dexhart before yesterday,
and that's all I want to say about the matter.
some people are saying this isn't the first time
that you've had sex with a married councilman.
who's saying that?
some people.
okay, this interview is over.
go home, lay low, the truth will come out.
I can't. I have too much work to do.
this department is not gonna deputy-direct itself.
I think we can manage.
just give me your schedule and we'll cover for you.
okay, I've made copies of leslie's daily work schedule.
so we'll just split into teams,
and each team will take... [muttering]
damn, ten items... And we'll knock this out.
I swear to you, I never even met the guy
before last night.
it's okay. I believe you.
you do? - Of course.
I think I know you pretty well.
that doesn't sound like you.
thank you.
if I ever see that guy,
I'm gonna punch him right in the face.
Yeah, that's sweet. Use your night stick.
which meeting is this?
the organization of local auditing systems.
kill me.
all right, first order of business...
uh, leslie-- where's leslie?
um, I gave her the day off, paul.
I thought that was best. - Oh, yeah. That's good.
so you'll be making the presentation then, ron.
Yep. Yes.
Hey, so, uh... [clears throat]
that kind of brings us to what I wanted to talk to you about.
I, uh
you know, my-- [clears throat]
army reserve unit
we got called up to active duty.
I ship out in four days.
Oh, my god. Where are you going?
San diego.
Oh, my god!
it's not dangerous.
it's mostly maintenance.
but I'm going for, like, a year.
maybe 18 months.
and I was kind of hoping that maybe
you'd want to come with-- with me.
like on a permanent-type basis.
I don't know, it's
it's kind of a weird question.
I mean, I joined to put myself through college,
and, uh, it's, you know, I'm just a desk jockey,
but it's-- it's rewarding.
so yeah, I guess I'm in love with the army.
Oh, leslie. Well, yeah.
Yeah, that makes a lot more sense.
Yeah, I'm definitely in love with leslie.
it's--it's affirmative.
I--I know this seems kind of fast,
but I feel like we
I feel like we got something here.
I do too.
yeah? - Yeah.
well, you don't have to answer right away.
but you kinda do. I mean, I need to know...Soon.
[Clears throat]
Wow. - Yeah.
are you gonna go?
this whole dexhart thing is not making me feel
very attached to pawnee right now.
San diego, jeez. - Yeah.
you could learn how to surf.
I know how to surf.
I took lessons when I was a kid.
I'm actually pretty good. - I bet you are.
I would miss leslie like crazy.
Aww...
all right, sorted out that payroll issue--this is done.
bring a case of beer to sanitation. why?
let's skip that one. They can buy their own beer.
I'm getting hungry. Let's get something to eat.
Hey, have you figured out
what you're getting ann for christmas?
Oh, I got her a pretty great computer bag.
yeah? That's a terrible gift.
no, no, tom, she needs one.
she mentioned it to me two months ago,
and I wrote it down.
that's what's called being an amazing boyfriend.
have you seen ann? You know how hot she is?
men give women of that caliber speed boats,
private jets... Not computer bags.
okay, what do you think I should get her?
diamonds. Can't go wrong with diamonds.
diamonds?
there isn't a woman alive who doesn't love diamonds.
even the super-left-wing chicks
that saw blood diamond and cried...
when they get a diamond, they're, like, "yeah, bitch, gimme more of them blood diamonds!
make 'em extra bloody.
trust me.
we are here looking at a videotape.
this is back in April, 2005.
we see here we're looking at councilman dexhart.
Leslie, you should see this.
and he's now about to shake hands
with leslie knope, the alleged sex toy.
Oh, for cripes sake.
look at the way she's smiling at him.
and then almost unconsciously
touching her hands to her hips.
see that? Right there.
it's like she's sending him a message
that she's ready for childbearing.
Wow. - In a 24-hour news cycle,
the tiniest story gets dissected over and over again.
in 2004, a kid from pawnee went to the olympics,
and it was reported on for over a year.
he wasn't even competing or anything.
he just was going, literally, to watch the olympics.
it was way too easy to get this guy here.
councilman dexhart, this has gone far enough.
I want you to hold a press conference
and clear my name.
Mmm, no, thanks. - Why not?
what's in it for you?
well, to be honest, being linked to leslie
is a lot less damning than the real story.
you're like a glass of whole milk.
what are you, lutheran? I love lutherans.
councilman, with all due respect, get a grip.
if you don't hold a press conference,
I'm gonna come forward and tell the whole story.
it won't do you any good.
take it from me, denying only makes things worse.
listen, I gotta go.
I'm expected at two different maternity wards.
but before I go, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask
should we?
Oh, my god!
people already think we did it.
you've got nothing to lose.
I'm very good. - Get outta here!
all right, fine.
shoe shine. Shoe shine.
Oh, hey. - Hey.
I've been thinking about your gay boyfriend all day.
I have got some awesome ideas.
okay.
first idea: Spray tan gift certificates.
Uh...No.
trip to germany. Germany is awesome.
and expensive.
good call. I didn't think of that.
okay, you know how people say
that you should give gifts that you would want to get yourself?
what would you want?
easy. Indianapolis colts reggie wayne jersey
number 87, double-xl, home blue,
signed by reggie wayne right after he catches a touchdown
to win the super bowl.
okay, never mind. - No?
hip-hop abs dance fitness dvd.
we just received these exclusive photos.
we have pictures of city councilman dexhart...
Oh, my god! I cannot believe it!
the big issue now is who is this mystery woman?
she and knope are standing very close to each other.
and anytime you see two women
standing very close to each other,
you immediately assume... - No, no, don't say it.
please don't say it. - Lesbian.
Oh, of course. - What?
it is a veritable storm of information
coming in to the studios here today.
Hi, this is leslie knope, and I would like joan
to clear all of her guests tomorrow
because I'm coming on the show.
if you think that you can drag me and my friend
through the mud, then you've got
Yes, I'll hold.
it's unbelievable. - Hey.
what happened?
got a call from some panicky morning joggers.
apparently sanitation didn't empty this dumpster,
to the raccoons' delight.
I thought raccoons were supposed to be nocturnal.
not in this town, sweetheart.
in this town, they're 247.
we can't have raccoons for the christmas thing.
they'll hunt the kids for sport.
fess up, guys. Who dropped the ball?
bring a case of beer to sanitation.
bring a case of
Yeah, this one's our fault, ron.
and we will take care of this for you.
okay good, because I have to run a public forum,
supervise the maintenance crews,
and teach crafts at the senior center.
Simuaneously.
Joan, I just wanted to say thank you
for letting me be on your show.
I'm really happy that I have the chance to clear my name.
sure. I see you brought your girlfriend for support.
that's nice. - What?
Oh, no, she's not-- - and in five, joan...
she's a--we're-- - four, three...
you've got it wrong.
sex. Drugs, possibly. Rock and roll?
we'll find out on pawnee today's
exclusive interview with the woman
at the center of the dexhart sex scandal, leslie knope.
Leslie, my first question has to be
when did the affair start?
Joan, I spoke with councilman dexhart
for the first time that night.
we met for about 15 minutes,
and then I went home alone, and that's the whole story.
well, leslie, we all saw the tape
from four years ago,
and you were flashing some serious "do me" eyes.
that's just my opinion.
I don't understand why I'm on trial here.
you should be grilling councilman dexhart.
Oh, you know what, that's a really good idea.
uh, let's bring him out. Councilman, come on out.
Hi, sweetie.
why didn't you tell me he was gonna be here?
I thought it'd be more exciting.
you look great.
[joan laughs]
it's like I'm invisible.
okay, my name is ron.
you don't need to know my last name.
whoever wants to talk, go ahead,
and we'll be out of here in a tight 15.
I found a sandwich in one of your parks,
and I want to know why it didn't have mayonnaise.
what's so funny? - Oh.
Yeah, I don't think kids should be allowed
on the playground equipment.
okay, we've been over this.
if you're worried about swine flu,
use hand sanitizer
I'm not worried about swine flu.
I already had the swine flu.
I'm worried about the turtle flu!
the turtle flu... - Turtle flu.
turtle flu.
Joan, this whole pawnee sun story
is "gotcha journalism" at its worst.
honey, let's just keep our private life
in the bedroom where it belongs.
we do not have a private life.
stop saying that we have a private life.
the fact is we never slept together.
and if we did, you would have proof.
and we would have seen it by now.
councilman?
I can prove it.
she has a mole on her right buttock.
what? That is a total lie.
you've never seen my butt. What are you talking about?
he has never seen my butt.
[Chuckles]
well, I guess it's your word against his.
I mean... - That's right.
[joan laughs]
fine.
here, joan, why don't you look for yourself?
is this happening?
Wait...There's no mole.
there is no mole!
this exclusive story
there is no mole on miss knope!
I can't believe it's come to this.
this is utterly humiliating.
well, councilman, care to make a comment
about no-mole-gate?
Yes.
I really didn't think that miss knope would
pull down her pants on tv.
but since she did,
I will admit that the rumors of our affair
are indeed false.
thank you. - However...
I have no plans to resign.
Oh, great. Okay, councilman,
you know what, you're a class act.
thank you.
I thought you did great.
when you get all feisty like that,
it gets my heart racing.
like I'm on a stairmaster.
except more like in a sexual...Context.
I can't go to san diego with you.
my life is here. My friends, my career.
I guess I just thought, with everything that happened,
you'd want a fresh start.
I know, I-- I really care about you, dave.
I just
I love this town.
I'm sorry.
you want your ticket back?
no. You know what, keep it.
you may want to come visit me, right?
there's a $75 change fee,
but I could pay you that, or I could reimburse you.
there's a lot of ways we could handle that.
Oh, ho, that's, uh... [chuckles]
Hey. Sorry I'm late.
Hey!
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.
that took guts, mooning joan callamezzo.
Aww, honey... - Thanks, mom.
Oh, my god, is something wrong with the tree?
no, nothing wrong.
but it's almost 9: 00. It should have been lighted up
an hour ago.
we waited for you.
okay, everybody, countin' down!
[All] five, four, three, two,
one.
[cheers and applause]
it's gotten a lot harder to work in government.
you think winston churchill ever had to pull his pants down
and show his butt?
no. But would he have?
Yes.
now, could he have?
maybe not towards the end of his life,
but he would have.
because he loved his job.
ho ho! Reggie wayne!
you remembered me complaining about my computer bag.
do you like it? - Yeah, it's perfect.
it's way better than the gift that I got you.
Oh... - They're not even good seats.
Achh! - This is awesome.
it's not awesome.
I actually got you a second gift.
you don't have to come to this game with me.
you don't have to.
that's the nicest gift... - Is that good? Is that good?
anybody's ever gotten me in my life.
Oh, thank god.
there's a bunch of messages waiting for you
about a bunch of things I don't understand.
dude, this is gonna be so awesome.
what's gonna be awesome?
single mixer.
roomful of lonely ladies!
and fellas.
fish in a barrel, man.
we are all getting way laid, right?
Oh, good.
really, last time this guy hooked up with one girl, hour later, hooked up with her twin.
and twins!
actually I figured out later it was just the same girl who put a sweater on.
I see. - Okay people? What do I say?
what do I say all the time?
no personal business on company property.
pond. - Time.

okay...
with his whole life shattered, this guy became like a super cop.
ya know?
so I thought, wow, I should do that.
let the job fill my emptiness. - This job?

I'm hard sci-fi.
and never the twain shall meet.
kick ass revenge bro.
kick ass.
geez.
scotch rocks.
nice lookin' crowd.
it's not really my scene.
you don't date?
not old people.
you will someday.
I'll probably do like a Michael Douglas thing, you know?
grab some young hottie.
Ah, so you're an actor.
but not really a Michael Douglas type.
I'm more of a Colin Farrell, you know?
dangerous, yet vulnerable.
well, if doesn't work out
uh, it'll work out.
but if it doesn't.
it will.
Yeah, but if it doesn't, this might be you in 40 years.
but, why bother?
I don't mean to be rude but, isn't everything all dried up and limp anyway?
kid, this is the 21st century.
hey uh, okay so this is a text message.
so there's like grammatical issues or whatever, but, bottom line: "Btm line" uh,
so-called career = childish bullshit,
which I-- I'm assuming is childish bullshit.
uh,"if give fuck anything but yourself, buy ticket--" I don't even know.
buy ticket.
Oh, yeah like a ticket to Vermont.
Yeah, buy a ticket to Vermont.
Yikes.
Really?
is it-- Yeah I mean is that-- Dickish actually.
Yeah.
because I've been trying to think, like maybe he's right.
and I'm wrong, you know?
like maybe he's a good guy and I'm just the asshole who's breaking up the whole marriage.
of I at first thought I was the - sure.
the good guy, but I-- I dunno.
I really-- I-- I don't even know.
okay.
splitsville man, for sure.
you think?
it's in her body language.
I can read her body.
she's back on the market man if you're thinking about having a go, get in line bro.
whoa, there's a line?
Yeah.
I'm ahead of you 'cause you're the new guy.
alright. - Alright good.
didn't know you were into her, so...
she's alright.
she's not the hottest girl, but I'm not the kind of guy who's gonna be like, oh, she's-- you know, her brain is a nine.
what about her tits?
I mean don't get me wrong, she's got nice tits.
I'd give them a six.
and her face is decent.
I give that a six or a seven.
body, go to the gym.
once in a while, tone up the stomach.
overall right now, a six or a seven body.
eyes are really nice but you know, some makeup would be nice to kinda bring them out a little bit more.
and then her hair, brown, nice.
like the brown carpet.
I prefer linoleum.
but I-- overall it's a 6. 8
that's what I'd say.
that guy gets you up and ready right away.
these guys, more of a mellow all day style.
these babies take care of the aches and pains.
this shit's practically straight speed.
keep the right balance, dude, I'm a teenager.
that is amazing.
uh, and that one right there is the insta-boner?
Mmm-hmmm.
um, you think I could keep one of those?
for shizzle. - For shizzle.
anything useful?
Mmm, yeah, I bet you don't know what the biggest sexual organ is.
well that would be my throbbing-- brain.
it's your brain.
exactly, my throbbing five inch brain.
five inch brain? - Casey.
what? - Circulating.
Oh, Constance!
I'm sorry?
Oh honey, think!
Cabo, every night tequila and a new page from the karma sutra.
no, how about...
you're the only man I ever let go up there.
Oh, uh Jeffrey, Todd, T-Bone...
no, hold on.
you can't have forgotten about this.
huh? - Uh, I dunno.
um, Bruce. - Yes!
Yeah. - Oh my gosh.
what happened to your face?
nothing.
it's been 25 years, I got a line or two.
Yeah.
it's been 25 years huh?
Yeah.

um...
no.
no personal business on company pond.

no.
Hey.
um, can I get you anything?
no.
I just got hit on by one of the creepy old freaks.
whatcha doin'?
revenge.
I'm getting back at Roman.

hey Kyle.
hey man what's up.
lady in the pantsuit said she'd give you a blow-j in the back of her buick skylark.
even take out her teeth.
give me a ginger ale.
I'm parched.
it's rough out there, fella's just trying to get some bartender advise.
geez mister, I dunno.
it's not exactly our scene, is it fellas?
my advise, matlock.
I did a matlock.
you ever play a corpse? - No.
character with no life?
not allowed to breathe, can't even move?
that's a challenge. - Amazing.
so you're an actress.
wipe your mouth.
listen, my advise to you would be leave us alone.
okay?
leave us alone.
sorry about her.
where the fuck is my ginger ale?
here you go, sorry about that.
sweet, real speedy.
Dick.
bad back.
rolled my horse on the beach in Phuket.
scotch.
sounds a lot more fun than how I screwed up my back.
I'd share but it was my last one.
unless you go for the all natural stuff.
why yes I do.
hey Henry, what's up?
uh not much, just headed to the john.
drop the deuce.
just uh, actually meeting a man who offered me some pot.
Oh hey, I could really use a mellow.
yeah?
let me get rid of this and I'll meet you in the little boy's in a couple.
I dunno, you know, I don't really-- o-- okay.
so you flamed out huh?
acting thing was a bust.
total bust, yeah yeah.
total...
complete fuckin' bust.
money, celebrity, who wants the trouble?
why do you think you don't see old dudes like me trying to be famous?
we know better.
okay.
there's really only four things in life that are important.
you got friendship, mmm?
love.
sex, that's why I come to these things.
that's only three things.
Oh yeah, shit.
I forgot the other one.
is it work?
like uh, career?
no, it's a really big one.
let's get high!
hey uh, Ron wants you to tuck your shirt in.
what, you don't wanna tuck it in?
what's your problem?
tuck it in.
happy?
what the
it is exciting.
right? - Yeah!
Oh, are you kidding me?
I get to travel, I meet new people, everyday is new.
I finally, without a man, living the life I've always wanted to live.
and it's not like you're just some piece of furniture that he moves from the old house to the new house.
right. Yeah.
right. - I mean it should be like that.
you know, you should live your life.
you should write your name on the earth in gasoline and just like light that shit on fire.
Yes, yes!
it's our right! - It is our right!
we should grab it, we should seize it, it's ours.
have you ever given this speech to somebody before and they like did exactly what you're saying and then it totally ruined their whole life?
shoot, I'm on!
Oh, alright.
um, okay bye.
I-- okay.
remember the wrap party for Hooper where the stunt guy - Oh yes.
jumped off the roof into the pool.
you know what happened?
you know what happened?
uh, yeah he jumped in the pool.
fractured his skull.
that sounds horrible.
did we mention he was naked?
he was completely naked.
that sounds-- that still sounds horrible.
Oh my god it was so hilarious.
Oh and the coke was so good back then.
Oh yeah. - Remember?
I mean the shit they're snorting today, my god.
it's like baby formula.
come on, why bother?
it's like having a strong cup of coffee or something.
you know? Big freakin' deal.
Yeah.
do you remember when we did it in the phone booth?
do you remember that we were in glass and that everybody could see in.
or the time we did it in the yard when I broke my hand?
you broke your hand!
it was crazy! - Plaster all over both of us.
we did-- we had sex in some insane places.
insane. - And it was so much fun.
it was so much fun.
I had a good time.
it was a good time.
Henry, what is the craziest place that you ever made love?
a bed.
What'd he say?
What'd he say? - Bed.
what-- what'd we ask him?
I don't know.
what do you say Connie , when you get off let's say we take this party back to my place.
I dunno.
I don't think I want to.
I have to go to the bathroom.
harsh.
I didn't really go.
I know.
scotch.
man, I do not get women.
dude, you said that pill gives you an instant boner.
it's not like pushing a button.
still need the right mood and everything.
or is that gay?
to you kids, everything's gay now.
shit, I am high as a kite.
give me that, I gotta even my keel.
Yeah.
I don't see why you couldn't at least give him your number.
he's old.
well, how old are you?
what do you mean?
in years.
you're as young as you feel henry and I feel super.
what are you, like 48?
okay, well you did it on the set of hooper.
that was 30 years ago.
don't remind me.
but if you're as young as you feel and so is he, and you guys both feel the way you did 30 years ago when you had a great time together, then aren't you both still like...
the same person?
wait, what?
what? - I don't know, I'm sorry.
I-- I'm so fuckin' high.
it's just I wish I had someone that I got along with the way you guys get along.
there are four things that are important in life.
friendship, love, and sex.
what's the fourth one? - What?
what's the fourth one, you said there was what are you Constance, what are you do
is that pot?
my god it stinks like pot in here, what are you doing?
pot.
smoking pot.
God dammit what happened to the new Henry?
I-- now I-- shirt smells like pot.
okay you know what?
I'm not gonna bust you guys for smoking pot on the job.
even though I should, because it's really wrong.
okay, this is me, Ron.
giving you two a little straight talk.
you-- you're aware that I used to party pretty hard, right?
Oh, yeah.
yeah you made a bong out of cheese.
Oh my gosh.
I wanna show you something.
four years ago I vowed to get straight.
I put this in my wallet as a constant reminder.
I don't know what I'm looking at here Ron.
you don't
do you remember my party buddy Kevin Cathcart?
no.
that's where his foot used to be.
so pot made his foot fall off?
no.
he became an alcoholic, mixed gin and percoset on his way to work, he crashed the company van into a tree and lost his foot.
God.
where does pot fit in?
he smoked a lot of pot!
that's a leg?
made footless.
by pot.
get it?
give me this.
straight talk.
thanks Ron.
thanks Ron.
Oh, hello.
Hey. - Uh, are you here for something?
working the event, like you.
that the men's room?
uh, why?
what do you mean, why?
why-- I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
I mean I didn't stink up the place you know, not my thing when I'm working but there's an old guy in there and uh...
he has some bowel problems and he can't see so it's-- quite frankly it's a little messy in there.
I'd use the bathroom down the hallway.
it's not far.
so.
seniors, god what a word, huh?
Yuck.
but maybe it's because we're just not looking at it right.
sexy!
that's right, that's right!
okay that's good.
but you know, you guys won't admit it because you think that once you get older you have to act all dignified.
yes sir.
how am I supposed to be sexy?
if I can't even stand up!
I'm glad you asked.
if you read chapter nine,"sexy time," you'd know that your biggest sex organ, and I don't care who you are, is your brain.
that's where it starts.
respect yourself, respect your body, and then other people will respect you.
don't be afraid to seize the moment.
think of how exciting it was to be in high school and have all those nervous feelings, and who wouldn't want to go back to high school!
Yes, are there any questions?
okay, oh you again.
okay, yes sir?
isn't this whole thing kinda undignified?
you know what Fred?
what I really think you need to do is loosen up.
huh? - Yeah she's right Fred.
you need to loosen up a little.
you should listen to your nurse.
Yeah.
Oh my god!
I told you there would be surprises!
bet you're all wishing you had a nurse like this.
okay!
so I just got really high, and I had the weirdest fucking thing happen.
I'm getting a divorce.
Oh my gosh.
Oh my gosh.
cut the music!
Oh my gosh. Cut the music!
nurse. Nurse!
what are you-- what's happening?
she's not a nurse.
now do something!
okay, okay, what's all the commotion?
Oh, officer.
we got a man down, and this woman is not a nurse.
Yeah, uh...
I took a class!
I took a class, we'll do a two man version you're gonna do the back, you're gonna breathe-- and whatever that entails, and I'm gonna-- and I'm gonna smush the heart.
Oh shit!
is he dead? - What?
listen, listen to me!
this is what you were trained for!
he's a stripper. They're both strippers.
do something!
doctor?
is someone here a doctor?
is anybody a doctor?
there's no doctor!
okay, you took the class.
come on, do it, do it, do it.
it's a series
it's a series of breaths and compressions-- oh!
15 to two ratio.
that's right, 15 to two ratio.
here we go.
I was a girl scout.
come on.
it's okay, come on.
come on.
Oh no, it's the other way around!
just two breaths.
no, you can't tell me that now!
two breaths, two breaths, two breaths.
Bruce, no don't be dead!
don't be dead, oh god Bruce, please don't be dead.
Oh please Bruce!
Bruce, please live!
I'm too young!
you can't die!
Bruce, please, please.
live, dammit, you bastard!
okay, that's one.
is this part of the seminar?
Yes!
yes it is.
yes it's part of the seminar.
you see, you gotta be prepared, you gotta be sexy!
Seniorlicious!
tell your friends!
sorry, I thought this was the men's room.
Jesus! - It's not.
and again service-- knock it off!
excellent.
can't get any higher than that.
Oh Henry, where've you been?
guess what?
the bar's not gonna pack itself.
Where's Constance?
so uh, see you later then.
see you later. - Okay.
hey Casey, grab those boxes for me.
Yep.
no, calm down.
hey um, Casey I just wanted to say that we heard what's happening in your personal life with your marriage and stuff,
I wanted to let you know that if you need anything, someone to talk to, you know, maybe you just need a hug.
so ni-- oh thanks Roman.
what the fuck?
Oh fuck look, I-- that- is that-- real-- okay, sure.
in my pocket.
fuck.
snap, motherfucker!
CracKedEggs & Noodles
Hey, listen!
you know who l hate most in the world?
my dad. You know why?
all my dad ever did was to make me.
I raised myself.
you know how much l earn a month?
barely $1 , 000.
not enough to buy myself the bare necessities.
you don't know what you're getting yourself into.
put that away!
what's wrong with you?
where you going?
Hey!
I'm going to abort your child, Dae-kyu, you bastard!
the economy's so bad...
what if all the record companies go out of business?
won't that be good for us?
are you kidding?
ever seen a dead tree bear fruit?
for us fakers to survive the originals have to do well.
what the hell took you so long?
Hey! Where are you off to?
you're supposed to be working! Not me!
you should leave him alone today.
Why? Did his old man croak or something?
croak?
do you have to say that? - Fine.
did his father pass away? Happy now?
hah, a little more and you might hit me.
where you going?
at least give me my salary before bossing me around!
I mean, I know exactly how much he has in his account.
so why the hell isn't he giving me my salary?
what's wrong? What did Jin-Young say?
nothing... she just cried.
why would she cry?
it's her fault she got pregnant.
well...
I just feel bad for her.
why would you feel that?
it's you who's worse off.
Oops. Darn...
when will my life finally get on track?
look, there's nothing to life. It's a gamble.
this is all it'll take.
once I hit the jackpot, I'm done!
the lottery again?
I can only seem to get the first three numbers.
it's killing me.
you're out of your mind.
who is it?
I thought I'd burst!
who are you?
who are you?
do you have to go, too?
this place sucks.
does she live here, too?
I think you've got the wrong address...
you know Chun Mi-yeon?
she's my mom.
you two used to be in a high school band, right?
my mom sang better than you...
but you wanted to be the singer so she slept with you to get lead.
I'll be living here from now on.
Hey! Gwi-Nyu! Gwi-Nyu!
Oh, right!
my name's Chun ln-Kwon.
of all the rock stars, mom had to name me after a freak.
I hear you wanted to be like him.
look, I'm not Lee Dae-Kyu!
so get out of here! There's no one here by that name!
close the door and come here. I need to talk to you.
I've seen your picture. You're my dad.
get out of here. Try next door.
you're up early.
their new album is out?
okay. Is the boss there yet?
fine, I'll be right there.
where do you go to school?
are you messing with me?
what's the name of your school?
give me your number, quickly. Your home phone number.
your number! Quickly!
your mom's cellphone number, then!
can't you hear me? Hey!
tell me your mom's number if you don't want to end up here.
shit, I don't know.
shit?
shit? Why, you...
did your mom teach you to say " shit " ?
did she tell you to say that in front of adults?
you little beast!
I feel sorry for your mom. And your dad, too.
how did they mess up a kid so bad?
nobody talks bad about my mom!
you wanna die?
I can take you in one blow!
Mr. Lee Dae-Kyu?
kids his age can be a little mischievous. Sheesh.
that doesn't mean you can treat your own kid like this!
I've got better things to do!
take him!
he had nothing all day, so get him something to eat.
no leeks?
eggs?
no eggs?
should I run out and get some?
that'll take too much time.
so you don't know?
even now, when your dad gets drunk...
remember that cow you sold?
he yells at me to go find it!
my nose still hurts from when your dad hit it with a poker.
you know that?
do you know Ki-Joo's number?
Ki-Joo? How would I know that?
I'm working my butt off at a stupid farm over here.
I thought you two went to Seoul together.
after you left here for good he packed up and left home, too.
wait for me, dad!
dad! Wait!
wait for me!
dad! Don't go!
wait for me!
dad! Wait!
dad! Don't go!
wait for me!
Why's the wrapping on this so plain?
move!
you just sit still and be quiet!
move!
who are you?
let me go!
who's this kid? - Dae-Kyu's nephew.
where the hell do you think you are?
what's this all about? What is this, a day care center?
why'd you bring the kid here? What are you trying to pull?
come on... his sister asked him, just for today.
are you out of your mind?
Dae-Kyu! Hey!
this isn't some kindergarten, you know.
it isn't some snotty nursery.
what the hell's he doing here? Get him out!
don't touch that! Go sit over there!
no, I want him out of here!
there's nowhere for him to go.
I won't bring him here anymore.
I'll take him with me later.
no. I want him out now!
come on, he's just a kid...
Hey! Come out here.
as soon as I'm gone, you two screw this joint up!
and where are you going? Hey!
dad! Dad!
don't you sing anymore?
you're recording music tapes... Why not do yours?
uncle...
who was that guy back there? Is he your boss, dad?
why didn't you do something when he hit you?
Oh...
if you did anything, you'd get fired, right?
Hello?
is this Mr. Lee Dae-Kyu?
Yeah.
I'm Jin-Young's brother...
what are you doing, dad? Aren't you getting off?
it's our stop.
it took forever by subway, but the bus is way faster.
I was shocked, that's why.
so do you believe all this now?
I was really surprised. Think about it.
imagine I claimed to be your dad, when you already have a father...
wouldn't that be shocking?
and I have to go to work every day.
I can't look after you.
you stay with your mom, and I'll visit you every Sunday.
what should we do this Sunday?
go to an amusement park?
it's a promise! Man to man!
a promise between men, okay?
um...
before that, I want to do just one more thing...
take it! It's enough for the ride back!
what?
that bastard and I had a fight several days ago.
he's a friend only when we're drinking.
I need to get a phone number.
what am I a detective?
how will I get that? What's in it for me?
two hundred dollars. - Two hundred?
two hundred it is. - As soon as possible.
you messing with me, boy?
stop kicking my door!
what you want to do is too hard, even for adults!
I saw it on TV before. Kids my age were doing it, too!
are you nuts? It's a million degrees outside!
but I want to do it...
why that? Of all things?
that's my business.
and this is my business!
I don't want to do that!
give me another option. We'll do that.
don't have one?
then forget it!
goodbye!
that's what life is like!
well, that makes sense.
it must be everyone's fault!
but I know everything! Shut up!
will it go away if we sing hard enough?
will we be loved if we love first?
will we succeed if we're rich enough?
can we speed if our car's good enough? Shut up!
Hey, kid! - Huh?
where do you live? - Apartment 301 .
Hey, go back to your bed son.
life goes on... Life goes on...
shut up!
police?
yes...
this weird kid barged into my house.
he's making a ruckus, and all the neighbors are mad!
you're on your way?
Hey! Listen!
hold on.
if you go to your mom's, I'll drop you there.
if not, it's prison for you, pal.
the police are on their way.
won't you be in trouble if the police come?
Why?
because I'm going to tell them what you do for a living.
you... you...!
look! You're threatening me?
call for you. Get the phone, please.
Hello?
Oh, so what made you answer the phone this time?
what's it to you, huh? Who the hell are you?
I'm Jin-Young's brother, you bastard!
I think you've misunderstood some things.
I've already met her, and...
you're in for it when I go to Seoul.
hanging up on me won't save you!
try hanging up again!
I'll leave as soon as we do that.
No! I really don't want to!
I'll go home right away to my mom.
Yeah, it'll be over by tomorrow night.
this might be the death of me.
all right. Tell the boss for me.
write the date now Okay then.
write your name down, too.
let me see.
okay!
I should go out to sea and remain a lonely bird...
so this is the southernmost tip of our country.
feels weird, doesn't it?
this smell!
I like the sea because it never changes.
whatever the reason, it feels good to be here!
what are you doing?
is there something on the ground?
Hey, let's take a picture!
come on. Let's take one picture.
what's so dorky about taking pictures?
Hey!
are you sure you want to do this?
let's just have some sashimi and go home.
I'm just kidding!
OK! Let's begin our cross-country hike!
walking the length of the country!
let's go, let's go, let's go!
the earth is round anyway, so if we keep walking...
you can't give up already!
the game's just getting started!
will that be enough?
are you sure you don't need muscle enhancers?
you know, it also takes courage to admit defeat.
if you don't get up by the count of ten, it means you give up!
let's go!
open the door...
I need to go pee...
I look pretty good!
Hey, freak! Do the laundry, will you?
I'll be right back.
Where's the yogurt? - Coming!
sweety, Tell them you want me for an hour.
just an hour. Come on.
where were you drinking? - I had some with my dinner.
come on, just an hour...
what will we do for an hour?
take us both to the karaoke.
I know you love to sing. - Are you drunk?
why should I go there with you?
come on, stop being so cheap. - Do you want to go sing?
yeah...
a woman is not only a face, a real woman has a good heart...
a woman who never forgets a single meeting is a real woman...
Hello?
where the hell are you?
I'm in Jeolla Province, sir.
you hiding on me? - I moved here yesterday.
look, I can track down your sorry hide anywhere.
let's see what you can do then. - Whatever, sir. Do as you wish, sir.
try to hide all you want. - Look for me all you want, sir.
I'll get you and hack to pieces, you fucker! - Ok, please.
let's sing another song!
number 3852!
the World Cup song! - World Cup?
Hey!
Hey!
can't you hear me?
let's take a break!
give me some water at least. I feel like throwing...
ugh...
I don't feel so good...
even soldiers wouldn't march on a day like this.
haven't you had enough?
what would you know about the adult world?
no one asked you to drink
if smoking, drinking, and girls are all it's about...
I could be an adult myself.
what about you?
you go every 30 minutes!
I'd wear a diaper if l were you.
you've got a baby pecker and you can't even pee that far.
you can't come close to my...
Hey! Watch it!
you've got nothing on me.
Really? - Thank my ass.
I worked my butt off for this. I feel like your bitch.
okay. Thanks!
no you're not. You better pay me in full.
sorry. I'm sorry.
how'd you find out so soon?
you've got great friends. - Whatever.
I'll give you the number, so try calling her.
okay. Thanks.
what's wrong with your pee?
my shoe's rotting here!
Hello?
um... is this Mi-Yun's cellphone?
Hello? Hello?
I can't hear you.
you've got the wrong number.
it wasn't her!
you got me the wrong number!
Hello? Hello?
damn it!
let's go!
Hey, urine boy! Let's go!
leave it alone!
so you're talking again?
and I thought drinking my pee had turned you mute.
whatever, kid.
as soon as I get her number, that's it for you. That's it!
it'll be over right then!
Hey! You punk!
you stop right there!
Hey!
just look at you!
Hey, urine boy.
wash the clothes in the bathtub.
I can't. This hurts...
stop faking and go do it. I've nothing to wear tomorrow.
after the sunrise... the sunset comes...
the moon comes up... and the sun returns...
why do you sing those?
can't you sing normal, cutesy children songs?
it's like you're freaking fifty.
one little tadpole...
two little tadpoles...
three little tadpoles...
four little tadpoles...
five little tadpoles...
we have to go from here to here.
today's our three day, right?
see, we came this far.
does this make sense to you?
we've come a long way.
fine, you win. You can stay with me.
we've done enough, so let's go back home.
you can stay with me till school starts.
after that, we can decide after I meet your mom.
do you want to quit that bad?
then forget it. I'll go myself.
Hi!
Hi!
will that be on TV?
just one question.
why do you want to do this?
are you advocating human rights?
yearning for unification?
this will make my wish come true.
what wish?
he said if I walk the country, my wish will come true.
who said? - Han-Byul...
who's that?
he's a fifth-grader at my school.
he made a wish, and promised God he'd walk the length of Korea.
and last summer, he did it.
people told him to stop, but he finished the trip.
you know what happened then?
what do you mean? What happened?
soon after, his mom got better and came home from the hospital.
look, urine boy.
you're not fooling anyone with this phoney innocence crap.
however hard it might get, you'll get your wish in the end.
look at you all sweet!
who said that one? That Han-Byul guy?
someone I know.
look, I've been here 20 years longer than you have.
people who say that are just trying to escape their miserables...
never mind.
so what's your wish?
if I tell you, it'll jinx it.
if it comes true, I'll let you know.
come on! Let's walk a bit more, then go eat something.
will you be paying for it?
we can go wherever you want. What do you want?
fried chicken and a beer...
that'll be perfect.
it's that kid!
Yeah, it is.
Hey, come here!
are you going to the DMZ, too?
Yeah.
so are we.
is that so?
have one.
so you're going to the demilitarized zone?
thank you.
you're the producer, right?
you're smart! How'd you know?
I saw you on TV once.
he's my da...
he's my uncle.
your nephew might find this hard...
you're a pretty great uncle.
well... he wanted to do this, so...
would you like one?
that's okay.
you're pretty brave.
what do you want to be when you grow up?
what's your dream?
to be a rock star!
like this?
would you like to try singing in front of those people?
not for free.
we're going to shoot this, okay?
is it rolling?
now, try it in front of the camera.
Hey, let's go. What are you doing?
after the sunrise... the sunset comes...
the moon comes up... - I'm so sorry.
and the sun returns...
what are you doing?
flowers will bloom...
let me go! I want to go sing!
we're on a street!
what are you, a beggar? - So what if we're outside?
I want to do it.
don't talk back to me.
you used to sing, too!
you left mom to go sing in Seoul!
I don't need this! I'm going back there!
Hey! Stop right there!
who said that? Who told you?
who told you all that?
I heard it in my mom's womb!
you want to die?
fine! Do as you want!
go sing all you want, go walk to DMZ all you want...
you can go up the stupid mountains for all l care!
just my luck to get stuck with an idiot!
I heard it in the womb!
I heard it in my mom's womb!
just give me three days.
will that be enough? Just take three years off!
stop worrying about it. - I'll come back tomorrow then.
I'll go to work tomorrow, sir. - No, you don't have to.
forget it! I've already found someone else!
Hello? Sir! Hello?
vacancy
Ja-Ok... Oh my sweet Ja-Ok...
screw it...
I'm doing nothing wrong.
sir, sir!
Yeah, what?
can you turn it down?
how much did you pay for the tape?
three dollars?
can I see it?
you got totally screwed over!
this crap for three dollars?
I can't believe it. - Hey, look at the rain!
can you make it to Seoul by tonight?
who'd have thought I'd see you here?
sir! Sir!
you were dozing off, weren't you?
no.
so why are you driving like this?
you crossed the yellow line!
pull over!
Jesus!
sir!
you were drinking!
I just had a drink at dinner...
you're driving drunk with a passenger in your car?
sorry about that.
you're sorry?
will you be sorry if we get into an accident?
what if I died?
are you? Are you dead?
if you die, I'll die, too!
I'm sitting in the car, too!
have we gotten into an accident? Have we?
what did you say?
get out if you want to!
I don't want an untrusting passenger, either!
will it go away if we sing hard enough?
will we be loved if we love first?
will we succeed if we're rich enough?
can we speed if our car's good enough?
shut up!
shut up!
shut up!
shut up and listen to me!
we must continue!
we can't become fools!
life goes on!
I must be nuts. I'm going to die out here.
just this. - $2. 60
just the ramens.
just the ramens, please. - $2. 60
put these back, kid.
you don't want any, right?
wow, this is really good!
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
who's calling?
Chun Mi-Yun?
you're Mi-Yun, right?
look, who the hell is this kid?
Hello?
Hello? Hello.
is it raining still?
I think so.
feel like a drink?
wow, great!
Hey, you!
Hey! Stop right there!
Oh, damn my head!
you all right?
are you going to quit?
I already talked to him.
are you out of your mind?
I was going to quit anyway.
tell him to send my money to my account by tomorrow.
if he says he's not sending it...
I'm telling the cops.
are you crazy?
if you do that, you and I will get hauled in too!
don't start on me.
what start?
look... - What?
can you lend me $100?
Cheers!
what a lucky coincidence!
I thought I'd never see you...
dad! I'm all done here!
dad? Who's that?
uh... he's a cousin...
a sixth cousin or something... He keeps calling me dad.
go give the dishes to that lady. Rinse it off first.
are you sure you're cousins? - You two look like each other.
I guess everything is your treat. Let me treat you too
is there a store around?
it's okay. This is enough.
go in and rest.
I'm okay.
you gotta have fruit when you're having beer, right?
who's that?
who the heck are you?
thief! Stop!
stop right there!
why is watermelon so expensive here?
what's with your clothes, uncle?
Oh, I think I tripped and fell because... it's dark out.
I mean, I fell before, and I tripped, so...
my back is so...
did you steal it from the field?
No! I bought it...!
give it here. I'll slice it for you.
can we get some mugs?
why did you steal it?
you made a fool out of your dad...
what should I do now? I got fired from work...
look, I'm going back to Seoul and getting a DNA...
his dad's talking to him, but he's snoring on me...
hello...
young man! Do you know how to drive?
so where should I go at the intersection?
just go straight! Straight!
just hold tight a bit longer.
would you look at him?
would you look at him?
uncle? Let's go...
what time you getting off work? - Go over there.
the kid uses the restroom every 20 minutes.
so don't say that he's just got a flu...
write down that he's really sick or something.
so he'll stay put on his own.
it's been a while since l've seen an uncle with his nephew.
Oh... yeah...
your nephew's very sick.
I knew it.
just get us the medicine.
he just needs to be more careful, right?
like... stop tiring himself out...
don't overexert himself...
don't get too much sunlight...
can you write that all down?
and maybe you can tell him to watch it from now.
and he told me not to tell you this, but...
don't tell him I told you.
told me what?
there should be a hospital near his old orphanage.
maybe you can go there.
or go visit a bigger hospital in Seoul.
an orphanage?
he said he used to stay there.
it's called neuroblastoma.
it's a relatively common kind of cancer in children.
he's already in the last stages.
the kid even knows about his sickness.
no, no, no. It's just kidding.
you just killing me.
Where's the sauce? Can I have the sauce?
sauce...
you're in charge of the schedule. What happened there?
you know, you should...
it's totally different, you know.
you're the producer, right?
uh... yeah. - Remember the trek to DMZ?
I was with this small kid Remember? The kid?
Oh... right. Yeah.
I'm so sorry to bother you.
if I'm not interrupting...
so nice to meet you.
can't you guys do it right?

actually, we were... um...
Hey, I just... just...
you've got a long trip ahead. You must be tired.
I just wanted to buy you guys a drink.
these guys can't drink.
I just wanted to treat you. So if you could just...
I can't drink.
look...
you disrespectful prick!

I'm not drunk! I mean, how can you...?
Where's our order?

they want the kid's guardian...
I have to reach you!
please... call me when you hear this...
detector Kang gave me the heads up.
after all the money I gave him...
he couldn't even let us know very far in advance.
I saved nothing.
and that boss of ours took off to China.
what about my salary?
didn't you hear what I just said?
the jerk took off to China!
look...
first, get the down payment from my studio.
and leave my stuff with the moving guys.
the number you gave me... I think it's the right one.
but she's not answering.
can you use a GPS or something to track her down?
if you just get me the basic area, I'll look for her myself.
damn it's hot!
please?
fine, fine! Fine! How much?
when did you get here, uncle?
we can go home now.
the doctor said I just have to take it easy.
last night, the old lady brought us our things.
so we can head out now.
dad, what's wrong?
we have to sign the forms, so come out with our stuff.
uncle!
we wasted too much time.
uncle, Should we grab something to eat first?
you've got cancer!
I'll get treated as soon as this trip is over.
we promised, remember? Man to man.
after this is over, I'll do anything you ask.
promise.
Hurry!
get in!
come on. Get inside.
mister!
if you go straight, there's a place called Kyodong.
take us to the city terminal.
I bet you never ate this in the orphanage.
once you're hospitalized, you can't eat these.
enjoy it while you can. Hurry.
will you please eat now?
you need the strength if you want to walk more.
we're leaving right after we eat, right?
this isn't even that good.
my mom cooks better.
the mom who left you at the orphanage?

I never wanted this!
Hey!
you said we'd leave soon after!
what's all this?
I'm just trying to be the dad you never had!
we wasted enough time at the hospital.
what the hell do you take me for?

Chun In-Kwon!
I'm going back to Seoul!
Hey! Where you going?
isn't it this way?
we have to start from there.
what does it matter?
if we start over there and my wish doesn't come true...
will you be responsible?
then since it's your wish, you can start there yourself.
give me the bag. - Why?
I need something from it. - Just take it out.
just give it to me! - No!
give me the bag!
my back feels cold!
after the sunrise... the sunset comes...
do you take credit cards? - No.
how much is it?
$5. 20.
can I just have it for $5?
you're maxed out.
just try it one more time.
this is the eighth time, sir.
look, I've got a kid...
I'll go to the ATM tomorrow, so please...
let's go.
you stay outside.
what are you afraid of, huh?
am I going to steal the room or something?
what's wrong with you?
I'm an outcast!
I'm going to the sea now!
taking a net with me, get myself a few fishes!
I'm just a sorry cat!
I'm a light, dancing pretty...
illuminating the sorry city!
I'm just a sorry cat!
and I'm hoping for the day I see...
the day I see the deep blue sea!
such a deep blue sea,
you're sinking down
a bottomless abyss...
I'm going to the sea now!
taking a net with me, get myself a few fishes!
I'm just a sorry cat!
I'm a light, dancing pretty...
illuminating the sorry city!
got any change?
thank you.
I'm just a sorry cat!
and I'm hoping for the day I see...
the day I see the deep blue sea!
$2. 10.
$1 . 50.
just give me these. Here's $2. 10.
I'm trying to leave enough for the room!
Where'd you get that?
did you take it out of the hat?
I told you not to steal!
SHEESH! We'll take all of this.
you've got quite a few tricks. Where'd you borrow all those?
from the girls next door.
next door?
they didn't even open the door when I knocked.
they didn't?
you're okay, and I'm not, huh?
you made all the money, so I'll cook the ramens.
bring that over here.
and turn on the burner.
okay...
some people toss it in when the water's still cold.
of course that's no good.
the noodles will get too fat!
gotta stick it in when the water's boiling!
some put in the flavoring first!
but that's weird!
while the noodles are cooking, we get the eggs and leeks!
they're not required of course!
but you'll be missing out!
chop up the leeks!
put the lid on and wait!
crack the eggs, nice and clean!
put the lid on and wait!
chopped leeks, and cracked eggs
are you singing or rapping?
both...
you just made that up, right?
no.
I wrote it two years ago.
it was a huge hit.
chopped leeks, and cracked eggs!
I'll do the leeks, dad will do the eggs!
chopped leeks...
what?
say the next verse.
why should I do that?
try it!
please?
and a cracked egg!
not egg! It's cracked eggs!
try it again.
chopped leeks...
and cracked eggs!
I can't believe this.
chopped leeks!
and cracked eggs!
chopped leeks! - and cracked eggs!
chopped leeks! - That's all there is?
chopped leeks and cracked eggs!
fine.
I'll tell you the rest.
chopped leeks, and cracked eggs!
have too much and you'll get a bellyache!
have way too much and you'll end up in the emergency room!
that's what my mom said!
Hey. - What?
it's so good!
I know.
eat it with kimchi.
In-Kwon?
are you in there?
are you taking a dump?
why am I so thirsty?
Hey, I just dreamt that I was this really rich millionaire.
you want to help me make some money?
after we get you treated...
we can go around the country...
if we just do what we did today, we'll rake in the money!
let's get ourselves a car!
a Peugeot...
how does that sound?
no wait. A Porsche is better.
I guess a Peugeot will be better for the two of us...
and we can move, too!
to a rich neighborhood...
get him some strong medicine.
I'm talking real bitter.
I'm not the sick one, so...
can you make him live just a bit longer?
it's okay if he loses his arms or his brain even
well... the boy's too far along down the road, so...
what if we forget about getting treatment?
that would actually be better for the boy...
so how long does he have left?
two, three months at most.
three months at most?
that's it? Even with your best medicine?
this isn't right...
if we do pursue treatment, he'll find it very hard.
besides, all it does is slow the process...
you should make the decision.
the line is off at the moment, so...
I bought the $2. 10 tickets!
how much did you put in?
fifty bucks.
Wow! Spread the wealth!
this isn't even my money...
why isn't this bastard picking up?
I was calling...
Where's my money?
Where's my down payment?
uh...
fine. Don't worry. It's here.
come here.
Where's my money? Where is it, bastard!
you know what that money is?
you know what it means to me?
stop it, you jerk! It's here!
where is it!? It's not here!
that was my money!
you know what that money means?!
look! Look you piece of garbage! Look at how much it is!
your room? Damn, it's worth more than that!
what was I supposed to do?
the boss took off.
the creditors knew about your down payment...
I had no way to repay it.
I took out my own down payment. To get you your money back.
Yeah, real proud of you.
I mean...
do I look like a guy who'd steal my friend's money?
this is $500, right?
this is the money I borrowed.
take it. Your kid's in the hospital.
just give me $100.
see, there's always a way out.
who knew I'd hit the jackpot?
if you hadn't, I would have killed you.
Oh, right!
I got the address! - What address?
I traced the number.
that's not her name.
this is the right place...
how long have you lived here?
me? About a month.
and your friend has been here longer?
quite a while.
what does she look like? How tall is she?
about... this much taller?
how much is that?
it's not her.
she's short.
stop right there!
Hey!
open the door!
No!
you can't cut my hair!
In-Kwon...?
okay, we won't cut your hair today.
let's just give you your shot, okay?
Where's my kid? - No!
in here.
get out of here!
we need to cut his hair.
but he ran off. - Go!
move aside. Move.
get away from me!
come out!
In-Kwon!
just go.
I'll take him to the barber and shave it off myself.
just go...
come out here right now!
you and your mother are both so stubborn.
mom said I'm nothing like her.
are you sure you won't regret this?
you're not feeling sick?
no.
whatever. You practically breathe pain-killers.
I shouldn't have told you that I know.
I should have left you to do whatever you want.
my face came out this big on TV!
you were way off in the corner.
that was only in the preview.
it's not like you got paid Did you get paid?
if my friends saw it, I would have been a star.
would they have seen it?
let's do it. I said I'll do it!
you stopped bathing, just to look poor and needy, didn't you?
mom must have seen it...
you're really testing my patience...
sorry for what?
I'm so sorry.
get out of here. - I'm so sorry.
I made a big mistake...
I'm so sorry.
but we didn't get any shots! How are we supposed to air it?
the editing's all over now.
take him away. - Sir...
the broadcasting is not what everybody can do, you know.
please have mercy on my poor boy, Mr. Producer sir.
please, sir...
after the sunrise... the sunset comes...
the moon comes up... and the sun returns...
please let the sign show...
that we're looking for her Just tell them about it.
thank you.
thank you so much! - Thank you!
kid...
don't do anymore duets with your dad. It's your loss.
Bye!
goodbye!
should we go, too?
get in!
I'm okay...
never mind then.
fine! I'm getting in!
what a cheapskate...
men must regard promises more dearly than their lives.
what?
nothing, sir. You can go now, sir.
that's the way!
now you're talking straight!
that's how you're supposed to talk to adults!
okay, let's go!
are you crapping on land?
get the hell out!
I had to go really bad.
dad!
why do thingies get hard?
because you have to pee.
what if you don't have to go?
why are we here?
I think we took a wrong turn.
we should have taken route 26 instead of route 27.
Drat...
I'm fine.
I wanted to check out the sea anyway.
we saw it when started our trip.
I mean... Just one last time.
but then it's made in China, isn't it?
what the hell are you talking?
stuff like that is made in China? No way!
your skin is not like that by nature.
you're getting better because of me, you should know.
In-Kwon is really sick right now.
In-Kwon and I have a lot of things to tell you...
In-Kwon believes God will make his wish come true with this trip.
he believes he will one day meet his mother.
I want to see what you've taken.
we prayed that In-Kwon will finish the trip in good health...
and that he will be reunited with his mother.
and then she smiled.
even surgery couldn't make dimples that pretty.
she was really beautiful...
that's it? - Yeah.
you liked my mom because... of a dimple?
Yep.
I know you! I saw you on TV!
eat this and cheer up!
take care! - Thank you.
dad! Let's run, too!
you want to?
okay!
dad! Dad...!
are you okay, In-Kwon?
Yeah, I'm okay. How about you, dad?
I'm okay. I'm so sorry.
I think its best we scout all the roads from Samsong...
you agree?
that's the best way.
let's get started then.
let's go!
it's getting chilly. Right?
eat slowly.
drink this with it.
I told you to eat it slowly! Why are you wasting food?
are you okay?
eat it slow.
can't swallow?
what is this...
blood?
you're him! - What?
can I get your autograph? - What?
an autograph.
thank you for all your concern.
no problem.
he must be really tired.
kid, you have to fight for us. Fight harder.
what's this?
it's your performance fees.
actually, we were...
this is all part of our expenses.
thank you so much.
actually, we have you to thank.
when will we be on TV?
um... maybe this week? Or next week?
sir, I don't know if I should ask this, but...
I saw that your cellphone is the same kind as mine.
I'm out of batteries right now...
so I can't take any calls.
would it be okay if we switched batteries?
of course.
and I have one more favor to ask...
I walked a few hours alongside them...
it was really hard. The father guy is pretty awesome.
I'm going to rejoin them after dinner.
I'm going all the way!
let's go! - Don't lose hope!
uh...
should I do it again?
okay, that's a wrap.
Hey!
you didn't bring all that stuff we got, right?
what?
Damn! I left it in the car!
you stay here and don't move, okay?
where you going?
getting those drinks and rice rolls we got...!
you! You...
get your ass over here!
piece of garbage!
you think you're some kind of hero? Do you?
who are you? - Who am I? Who am I?
who am I?
I've done everything to get my hands on you!
who...?
I'm Jin-Young's brother!
that's right!
get up!
I am terribly sorry.
I bet you are.
you wouldn't be human if you weren't!
bastard!
lousy piece of garbage!
and...
I've never laid a finger on her, even once!
what about my poor sister!
dad?
dad, where are you?
I'm here...
what are you doing there?
stop! Stop! Don't come any closer!
Why?
I'm... taking a dump!
I've got diarrhea, so... My stomach's really hurting.
Really?
so you're doing that right there on the street?
stop! Stop! Stop!
Why?
I don't want anyone to see!
go be the lookout. See if anyone's coming.
all right then. Go number two!
that's my medicine.
huh? Yeah...
why are you eating that?
I didn't.
actually, I mistook it for vitamins before, and I liked it.
let me just have one.
are you tired?
no.
you're lying. This is tiring you out.
Hey, I'm an all-powerful he-man. You know that?
should we stop?
stop what?
I want to stop this now.
are you kidding me?
so why didn't you say so sooner? We're almost done!
why do you always make decisions on your own?
hell no I'm not quitting!
dad! - Huh? What?
wait.
Why? You need to go?
this right here... Haha...
it's really great!
feel better now?
you bet! Why didn't we think of this sooner?
dad! - Yeah?
I'm sorry.
about what?
because this is all I can do for you.
then push harder.
okay!
Yeah! Woohoo!
faster!
first gear!
second gear!
third gear!
that's fast enough!
wait! Brake! Brake!
In-Kwon...
hey... get up!
Hey, snap out of it!
Oh no...
In-Kwon!
Hey, snap out of it!
dad... I'm fine.
are you?
get up then.
get me my medicine.
okay. I'll get that for you.
why did you do that?
you've scraped yourself.
just fight till the end.
just a bit more. We're almost there.
my name's Kim Jae-Hee. I used to live with Mi-Yun.
I couldn't reach you, so... this is my last resort.
I heard you came asking for me the other day.
I had been keeping Mi-Yun's phone.
I'm sorry I didn't answer your calls.
to be honest... Mi-Yun asked me a favor...
actually...
she's...
she's no longer with us.
last year, she was diagnosed with lung cancer.
she died this summer.
before she died...
she was already outcast from her family.
she could barely breathe, and her little boy was also sick.
so... she had to send him to a nursery school, and...
not long after that...
she talked of the boy's father.
she mentioned he loved music.
she said she didn't want to burden you with the child.
I thought she was being foolish, so I dragged her to your house...
but she could never face you. She always turned back.
she told me to let him see you if something happened to him.
that's why I...
I'm sorry.
dad...
dad, why are you crying?
Why?
why did you do this?
let's quit now.
I'm really tired...
quit what?
quit what?
so why did you come here?
why did you have to come to me?
I'm sorry, dad...
I'm sorry...
Why?
why are you sorry?
why should you be?
Why?
come here.
come here...
closer, Here.
I just talked to your mom.
she said she's leaving us to get married.
she wants me to keep you.
so... you have to live with me now.
that means I'll kill you if you ever get sick again!
I'm sorry, dad...
why should you be...?
tired? - No.
I can walk...
forget it.
I saw mom in my dream a while ago.
you did?
she never did that before, even though I tried hard.
was she pretty?
Yeah. Real pretty.
I've got a lot to tell her.
about my friends...
about coming here with you...
you hated me, didn't you?
yeah...
I hated you every day before I met you.
but I forgot all that now.
I'm sorry.
it's okay.
you lost your job and all your money because of me.
I was nothing but a burden.
I'm so sorry...
did you miss your mom?
Yeah! A whole lot.
did you miss me also?
I did.
a whole lot...
when you do see her...
don't tell her about me meeting those other girls.
I'm not a kid!
Oh!
I have a confession to make.
what is it?
I'm not really your son! - Then...?
my real name's Jon. Jon Bonjovi.
I just changed it because it sounded tacky.
and I'm not your real dad, either!
I'm not really Lee Dae-Kyu.
my name's Bob Dylan.
I can see the end now.
what should we do when we get there?
have some fried chicken and a cold beer?
what?
that's what you want, isn't it?
Bingo!
you're quite smart.
then what about after that?
maybe... a sauna?
sounds good.
I'll scrub your back for you when we get to the sauna.
I bet it's all dirty because of me.
Inkwon, what's your wish?
my wish?
my wish already came true.
what was it?
spending time with you like this
at THIS VERY MOMENT,
young OLIVE SNOOK WAS 9 YEARS, 20 WEEKS, 4 DAYS, 11 HOURS, AND 33 MINUTES OLD.
two HOURS HAD PASSED SINCE HER FIRST RIDING LESSON
when SHE ASKED HER PARENTS FOR AN ARABIAN STALLION.
no.
endowed WITH A TENACIOUS SPIRIT AND THE INABILITY TO ACCEPT NEGATIVE STATEMENTS,
young OLIVE SET HER INTENTION TO GET THE HORSE HERSELF.
digging TO ARABIA WOULD BE EASY
head TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH,
then TURN RIGHT.
two WEEKS INTO HER QUEST, SHE FOUND A CREATURE OF A DIFFERENT KIND -- A 65-MILLION-YEAR-OLD TRICERATOPS.
the DISCOVERY GOT THE ATTENTION OF A SAUDI ROYAL,
who BROUGHT ONE OF HIS PRIZED STALLIONS TO TRADE, PER OLIVE'S REQUEST.
that DAY, OLIVE SNOOK LEARNED A VALUABLE LESSON -- THOUGH DIGGING WAS MESSY WORK,
it COULD ALSO UNEARTH UNTOLD TREASURES.
subterranean TREASURES CONTINUED TO EXIST IN THE LIFE OF OLIVE SNOOK,
PIGBY, PULL.
TRUFFLE-HARVESTING SEASON HAD COME
to THE CONVENT OF THE SISTERS OF THE DIVINE MAGNATUM,
causing OLIVE TO REFLECT ON THE REASONS SHE HAD COME TO THIS PLACE -- HER UNREQUITED LOVE FOR THE PIE MAKER
and HER VOW TO KEEP THE SECRET THAT LILY CHARLES WAS NOT CHUCK'S AUNT, BUT HER MOTHER.
PIGBY, PULL.
while SEQUESTERED IN THIS PLACE, OLIVE FOUND A NEW FRIEND.
what A DIVINE SPECIMEN.
sister LARUE WAS THE BELOVED HEAD OF THE CONVENT'S TRUFFLE OPERATION.
observing OLIVE'S PENCHANT FOR BURROWING,
she TOOK THE NEW ARRIVAL UNDER HER WING.
what DO YOU SMELL?
honey.
pepper.
you MISSED THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
sex.
Ohh.
a TRUFFLE'S SCENT MIMICS THE HORMONES OF THE MALE PIGS READY TO BREED.
that's WHY SOWS ARE THE BEST HUNTERS.
trying TO GET YOUR GROOVE ON, GIRL?
I KNOW HOW THAT FEELS -- FELT.
duty TOLLS.
time TO POLISH THE BELLS.
save ME A SEAT AT MIDDAY PRAYERS.
okay.
Oh, AND BE SURE TO GIVE PIGBY A LITTLE -- WHAT DO YOU CALL IT -- SOMETHING-SOMETHING.
Oh, EE, OH
Oh.
E-excuse ME.
Amen.
rise AND SHINE.
we GOT EATS -- FRESH AND FRENCH ON YOUR DOORSTEP, WHICH IS ODD TO SAY,
because YOUR DOORSTEP USED TO BE MY DOORSTEP,
and THOUGH I'M SAD YOU MOVED OUT AND INTO OLIVE'S VACATED APARTMENT,
I'm TRYING.
all RIGHT, THANK YOU.
I'll TALK TO YOU THEN.
Bye.
who WAS THAT?
Mr. PENNYBAKER.
I HIRED HIM, BUT THAT'S THE END OF THE STORY.
Ohh, DIGBY, ARE THEY FOR ME?
thank YOU.
come IN. COME ON.
sorry, WHERE WAS I?
Oh, YEAH.
so, LAST NIGHT, I WAS POLISHING THE FURNITURE YOU BROUGHT BACK FROM MY CHILDHOOD BEDROOM,
and I FOUND THIS IN THE DESK FROM THIRD GRADE.
your FAMILY TREE.
you DIDN'T FINISH IT.
no, BECAUSE I HAD NO RESOURCES.
mom DIED IN CHILDBIRTH, AND DAD -- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE.
the PIE MAKER DID,
and EVEN THOUGH CHUCK HAD FORGIVEN HIM FOR HIS HAND IN HER FATHER'S DEMISE,
the MENTION OF IT STILL STUNG.
your AUNTS COULDN'T HELP?
Mm -- NOT WHEN THEY'RE STEP-AUNTS.
see, DAD WAS IN HIS 20s WHEN HIS DAD MARRIED LILY AND VIVIAN'S MOM,
so THEY BARELY KNEW EACH OTHER.
but THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING.
nothing -- AND THEY FELT SO TERRIBLE ABOUT IT
that VIVIAN CRIED NONSTOP AND LILY WENT ON A 6-DAY BENDER.
so I HANDED MY ASSIGNMENT IN AS WAS
and NEVER QUESTIONED OR PONDERED MY LINEAGE AGAIN.
not UNTIL LAST NIGHT.
I've DECIDED...
I GOT TO MAKE THE MOST OF THIS SECOND CHANCE AT LIFE.
so I DONNED A DISGUISE -- OH, YEAH, SORRY.
and I WENT ABOUT DIGGING UP MY OWN ANSWERS WITH THE HELP OF CYRUS PENNYBAKER -- CATCH AS KING CAN, INC. YOUR GENEALOGY UNEARTHED IN 24 HOURS.
you're MAKING A SCOWLY FACE.
no SCOWL.
my NOT-SCOWL IS AN EXPRESSION OF NOT UNDERSTANDING
why ANYONE WOULD WANT TO GO ROOTING AROUND IN THEIR PAST.
after ALL THAT SHOVELING, YOU STILL WAKE UP IN THE SAME BED,
do THE SAME JOB, LIVE THE SAME LIFE,
except NOW YOU'RE GRIMY WITH A KINK IN YOUR BACK.
while CHARLOTTE CHARLES PONDERED HER PAST, OLIVE SNOOK CONSIDERED HER FUTURE.
father, I WISH TO STAY HERE FOREVER AND SERVE.
if THIS IS NOT THY WILL, THEN DROP ME A LINE.
Oh, MY...
it IS WITH HEAVY HEART THAT I REPORT SISTER LARUE DIED AT HER OWN HAND.
she WAS ALONE IN THE BELFRY.
we HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF STRUGGLE, NO SIGN OF ACCIDT.
but I JUST SAW HER.
she WAS VERY HAPPY.
to TAKE ONE'S LIFE IS A MORTAL SIN.
only PRAYER CAN HELP MITIGATE HER SOUL'S ANGUISH IN THE EVERLASTING FIRES OF HELL.
hell?
sister LARUE?
for OLIVE SNOOK, NEGATIVE STATEMENTS WERE STILL UNACCEPTABLE, AND PRAYING WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH.
private DETECTIVE EMERSON COD RARELY STAYED LATE AT THE OFFICE.
tonight, IT WAS A BLESSING HE DID.
uh, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, SISTER?
emerson, IT'S ME -- OLIVE.
as OLIVE SNOOK EXPLAINED WHY SHE NEEDED EMERSON COD'S SERVICES,
her WORDS WENT UNHEARD.
the VETERAN P. I.WAS HAVING TROUBLE WRAPPING HIS HEAD AROUND THE FACE BEFORE HIM.
you're KILLING ME.
have YOU HAD YOUR FUN?
Ohh.
as I WAS SAYING, THIS IS A MATTER OF HEAVEN AND HELL.
I NEED YOU TO PROVE THAT SISTER LARUE DIDN'T COMMIT SUICIDE.
Yeah, OKAY, WAIT A SECOND.
why ARE YOU PRETENDING TO BE A NUN?
Oh, I'M NOT PRETENDING.
I'm A POSTULANT.
that's A NUN IN TRAINING.
what GOT THEE TO A NUNNERY?
Oh, EMERSON.
you REALLY WANT TO KNOW?
not ESPECIALLY.
that WAS JUST MY ATTEMPT AT POLITE WEE TALK.
moment's PASSED, SO LET'S TALK COMPENSATION.
well...
I HAVE NONE -- VOWS OF POVERTY AND ALL.
Oh.
but I COULD PAY YOU IN PRAYER.
olive BRACED HERSELF,
knowing THAT EMERSON COD PRAYED TO A GOD ALL HIS OWN -- THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR.
to HER ASTONISHMENT, HE SIMPLY SAID...
deal.
Oh.
eh.
what SHE DIDN'T KNOW WAS A WORLD-WEARY DETECTIVE
with A MISSING DAUGHTER NEEDED ALL THE PRAYERS HE COULD GET.
Oh, PRAISE BE!
all RIGHT.
here's THE SITCH.
my SISTERS AND I?
straight-up SEQUESTERED.
strangers AND DROP-BYS ARE A NO-GO.
I NEED YOU TO FIND AN AIRTIGHT WAY, OESN'TINVOLVE ME -- I. E. WE'VE MET.
last, BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST, AND I CAN'T PUT TOO FINE A POINT ON THIS...
no NED OR CHUCK!
why'd YOU BRING HIM HERE WHEN YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T?
I NEED PIE BOY'S SPECIAL SKILL SET, AND PIE GIRL COMES WITH PIE BOY.
why ISN'T PIE GIRL MINDING THE PIE HOLE?
because SHE'D RATHER BE MINDING HIS.
besides, HE HIRED A NEW WAITRESS -- BRANDY, CANDY, I DON'T KNOW -- SOMEBODY NAMED AFTER BOOZE OR FOOD.
I'm SORRY, OLIVE.
I COULDN'T WAIT ANY LONGER.
olive TRUSTED HER ARMS TO ENCIRCLE CHUCK.
sadly, SHE DID NOT TRUST HER MOUTH WITH THE SAME PROXIMITY,
for IT INCREASED THE PROBABILITY OF TRUTHS BEING SPILLED.
Oh, I-I'M SORRY.
I-I DON'T KNOW YOU.
Oh, COME ON, OLIVE. WE'RE ALL ALONE UP HERE.
one IS NEVER ALONE IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD.
that's BAT CRAP.
it's A FREAKIN' CONVENT!
show SOME RESPECT!
I'm SHOWING YOU BAT CRAP.
you KNOW, FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO KEEP THIS PLACE ALL SPICK-AND-SPAN,
sister LARUE WAS SISTER HALF-ASS.
she JUST POLISHED THE BELLS.
sister OLIVE?
why DIDN'T YOU ALERT US TO OUR GUESTS' ARRIVAL?
our APOLOGIES.
I'm MOTHER MARY MARY.
this IS FATHER EDUARDO DE DONDE.
father DOWLING.
Vatican POLICE.
and, UM, THESE ARE MY ASSOCIATES, FATHER MULCAHY AND SISTER CHRISTIAN.
we HAD ASSUMED YOU'D BE ITALIAN.
we ARE ITALIAN.
part-time.
meaning, OUR WORK IS HERE,
but OUR HEARTS WILL ALWAYS BE IN PIAZZA SAN PIETRO.
uh, CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON WHY SISTER LARUE MAY HAVE BEEN UPSET?
the TRUFFLE HARVEST HASN'T BEEN AS GOOD AS IN YEARS PAST.
it's CAUSED STRAIN ON THE CONVENT'S FINANCES,
but THE LORD WILL PROVIDE.
he ALWAYS DOES.
well, I'M GOING TO NEED TO SEE THE BODY OF SISTER LARUE,
as WELL AS INSPECT HER ROOM, MAYBE SOME OF HER PAPERWORK.
I CAN ASSIST FATHER DOWLING.
I DID KNOW SISTER LARUE BEST.
you HAVE A PENANCE LIST TO COMPLETE FOR SKIPPING YESTERDAY'S VESPERS.
now, THEN, THE MORTAL REMAINS.
I'm NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT DOING THIS...
here...
with HER...
and HIM.
well, IT AIN'T LIKE HE AIN'T NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.
remember LAZARUS?
come ON, MAN, LET'S DO THIS WHILE I STILL GOT THE JOINT LOCKED DOWN.
did YOU KNOW CHUCK HIRED A GENEALOGY SERVICE TO PUT BRANCHES ON HER FAMILY STUMP?
not BECAUSE SHE COULD EXPOSE HERSELF.
she DODGED THAT WITH A HOOKER WIG.
it's BECAUSE SHE'S THROWING HER HEART INTO IT WILLY-NILLY.
what's SO GREAT ABOUT THE PAST?
it's PAST.
correction -- WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT YOUR PAST?
from WHAT YOU TELL ME, NOTHING.
that's WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO DELVE.
but SOMETHING'S PUSHING DEAD GIRL TOWARD CLEARING UP HERS,
so WHY DON'T YOU JUST STEP OUT THE WAY AND LET HER?
good, TAKE THAT AS YOUR CUE TO GET TO CRACKITY-CRACKING.
Ohh.
am I DEAD?
I'm SORRY, SISTER.
are YOU KIDDING ME?
Shh!
you Shh!
I've BEEN PUTTING UP WITH SILENCE FOR 10
can WE JUST ASK YOU A -- JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS?
I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU!
Where's MY WHITE LIGHT?
I KNEW THIS AFTERLIFE STUFF
was WHERE'S MY DIAMONDS?
wait, DIAMONDS?
what -- WHAT -- WHAT DIAMONDS?
whoever SHOVED ME OFF THAT TOWER AND STOLE MY STASH IS GONNA PAY!
Ohh!
Oh!
um, UH, BACK TO "SHOVED" -- AS IN MURDERED?
of COURSE, MURDERED.
what ELSE WOULD ITE?
nun ON THE RUN!
lay OFF!
we're SO GOING TO HELL.
so, BEFORE SISTER LARUE WAS SISTER LARUE, ???
that's A FANCY WORD FOR FUNGI SPECIALIST.
talked MORE LIKE A SAILOR THAN A SCIENTIST.
well, YOU'RE NOT FAR OFF.
it SAYS HERE SHE'S FROM A LONG LINE OF LONGSHOREMEN.
isn't IT FASCINATING -- YOU CAN PUT A LADY
through A PhD PROGRAM AND CLOISTER THEM FOR ALMOST A DECADE,
and STILL THE APPLE DOESN'T FALL FAR FROM THE TREE.
what's THE STATUS OF YOUR TREE?
family, NOT APPLE.
Mr. PENNYBAKER SHOULD BE PUTTING THE FINAL TOUCHES TO EACH LIMB AS WE SPEAK.
I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND NEGATIVE ABOUT ALL THIS.
you're ALWAYS SO SUPPORTIVE AND GOOD -- I DID SOMETHING BAD JUST NOW.
as YOU WERE PAWING THROUGH SISTER LARUE'S PAPERWORK,
I WAS DIGGING THROUGH OLIVE'S FILE.
I KNOW IT WAS WRONG,
but I NEEDED TO KNOW IF IT WAS MY FAULT SHE RAN AWAY AND JOINED A CONVENT.
And?
that PART OF THE APPLICATION WAS LEFT BLANK.
then YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.
you SAW HOW SHE TREATED ME IN THE BELL TOWER.
there WAS A HOOK -- AN ICE-COLD ONE, AND I WAS ON IT.
now, IF I'VE UPSET HER, I GOT TO FIX THAT.
she's THE CLOSEST THING TO A SISTER I HAVE.
how IS THERE A BREEZE IN HERE?
these WALLS SHOULD BE 3 FEET THICK.
this ISN'T A WALL -- IT'S A DOOR.
Oh, GOD!
to BE ABLE TO CLUTCH YOUR ARM RIGHT NOW...
come ON!
somebody's COMING.
let's HIDE.
sister LARUE WAS MURDERED?
I HIRED YOU TO DISPROVE A SUICIDE!
Oh, THIS CAN'T HAPPEN!
not HERE!
there ARE COMMANDMENTS!
we FOLLOW ALL 10, AND I AM COMMANDING YOU TO STOP!
emerson, THIS IS MY REFUGE, MY HOME.
you WANT TO SHARIT WITH A HOMICIDAL MANIAC?
well, NOT PARTICULARLY.
dang IT!
educate ME ABOUT LARUE.
she EVER MENTION...
diamonds?
no.
what ABOUT ENEMIES?
everyone LOOKED UP TO HER.
when SHE WASN'T IN THE ORCHARD,
she WAS DOWN HERE IN HER ROOM WITH HER SCIENCE BOOKS,
trying TO IMPROVE OUR MEAGER HARVEST AND TURN OUR FORTUNES AROUND.
Hey, THIS WALL IS HOLLOW.
Ohh!
magazines?
Ohh!
top-shelf FEM-CARE.
this STUFF IS ALL FORBIDDEN!
someone's there.
Shh.
Ohh!
please LET ME GO!
not UNTIL YOU FACE OFF WITH THE PAPAL FUZZ.
exactly WHAT'S BEEN COMING TO PASS UP IN HERE?
I TRY SO HARD TO BE GOOD,
but I CANNOT DENY THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I WOULD KILL FOR CANDY CORN.
in EXCHANGE FOR DOING OUR CHORES,
sister LARUE WOULD GET SOME FOR ME FROM THE OUTSIDE.
will I EVER BE FORGIVEN?
uh...
penance LIST.
uh, THIS SHOULD DO IT.
scram.
we've GOT A LEAD.
we SAW MOTHER SUPERIOR COMING OUT OF A SECRET DOOR.
and WE'RE GONNA CHECK IT OUT.
olive, YOU IN?
I'm -- I'M BUSY.
here's WHAT I GOT.
sister LARUE WAS RUNNING GOODS FOR HER SISTERS -- EVERYTHING FROM LIP GLOSS TO ROMANCE NOVELS.
I BET BLESSED BOSS LADY FOUND OUT AND DROPPED A HALLOWED HAMMER.
killing OVER THAT SEEMS A TAD EXTREME.
but PEOPLE KILL FOR DIAMONDS ALL THE TIME.
what IF LARUE'S GUILTY PLEASURE WASN'T SOFT LIPS OR HARLEQUIN TINGLES?
what IF IT WAS BLING?
and SHE SMUGGLED ICE INTO THE PENGUIN HOUSE FOR HERSELF?
if MOTHER SUPERIOR FOUND LARUE'S SHINY STASH...
then ALL IT WOULD TAKE WAS ONE PUSH, AND THE CONVENT WOULD BE BACK IN BLACK.
BY-PROXY HIGH FIVE.
Ohh.
get...
before I BY-PROXY VOMIT.
good EVENING, MOTHER SUPERIOR.
father DOWLING REQUESTED I PERUSE YOUR VISITORS' LOG.
while CHUCK DISTRACTED MOTHER SUPERIOR,
the REMAINING VATICAN POLICE PAID A VISIT TO HER SECRET ROOM.
it's TRUFFLE STORAGE.
I GUESS MOTHER SUPERIOR WAS JUST CHECKING IN ON THE CROP.
and CAPPING OFF A DO-IT-YOURSELF PROJECT.
Oh, THE BRICKS DON'T MATCH.
the MORTAR'S WET, TOO.
Oh.
Jericho TIME.
wait, -- LOOKS LIKE WE FOUND LARUE'S WAY IN AND OUT OF HERE.
we WERE HOPING TO INTERVIEW PEOPLE WHO KNEW SISTER LARUE,
but FROM THE LOOKS OF THIS, SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY VISITORS IN 10 YEARS.
some FAMILIES DISAGREE WITH THEIR DAUGHTERS' DECISIONS TO BE CLOISTERED.
often THEY CUT OFF CONTACT, NOT THE NOVITIATE.
how DID YOUR FAMILY ACT WHEN YOU DECIDED TO TAKE THE VEIL?
take THE -- THE WHAT?
become A NUN.
Oh, UM...
uh, THEY WEREN'T AROUND.
I LOST MY DAD WHEN I WAS 8, AND MY MOM DIED HAVING ME.
Ohh.
God BLESS YOU.
God BLESS HER.
I DON'T REALLY DWELL ON IT,
but UNEXPECTEDLY, I THINK OF HER, AND THEN, MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS...
hole IN MY HEART WHERE A MOTHER SHOULD BE.
I DIDN'T KNOW HER, AND I NEVER WILL.
of COURSE YOU WILL, MY DEAR.
in HEAVEN.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I'M GOING TO HEAVEN.
future UNCERTAIN, CHUCK COULD ONLY CLING TO THE PAST -- A PAST BEING PIECED TOGETHER BY A GENEALOGY EXPERT,
whom SHE NEEDED TO CALL AT THAT VERY MOMENT.
do YOU MIND IF I USE YOUR PHONE, PLEASE?
20 FEET UNDERGROUND AND ONE QUARTER-MILE TO THE EAST,
the PIE MAKER AND EMERSON COD FOUND LARUE'S SECRET DOOR LED TO A SURPRISE DESTINATION.
what THE HELL IS THIS?
Shh!
I THINK WE'RE IN THE BACK OF A RESTAURANT KITCHEN.
he MUST BE THE CHEF.
or LEATHERFACE.
my GOD.
leatherface HAS A 4-QUART FOOD PROCESSOR WITH A 2-HORSEPOWER MOTOR AND AN EXTRA-LARGE FEED TUBE.
I've WANTED ONE FOREVER.
JULIENNES LIKE A DREAM.
EHH!
where IS MY LARUE?
tell HIM.
rule NUMBER ONE -- DON'T BUY FISH ON MONDAY.
rule NUMBER TWO -- DON'T POKE AN ANGRY GERMAN.
swiss GERMAN -- HIS ACCENT SOUNDS LIKE THE CHEF WHO TAUGHT MY TORTES OF EUROPE PASTRY CLASS.
well, HE DON'T LOOK TOO SWISS TO ME.
sorry, SIR?
Mm!
sister LARUE IS DEAD.
we HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,
so PLEASE CONSIDER YOUR NEUTRAL HOMELAND AND PUT THE CUTLERY DOWN.
the FACTS WERE THESE
hansel VON GETZ, SWITZERLAND'S ACCLAIMED CHEF, DECIDED TO CONQUER AMERICA.
he OPENED A RESTAURANT NEIGHBORING THE SISTERS OF THE DIVINE MAGNATUM,
where, UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM,
sister LARUE DISCOVERED A DOORKNOB THAT HADN'T BEEN USED SINCE PROHIBITION DELIVERIES OF COMMUNION WINE.
just AS A TRUFFLE GROWS AMONG TREE ROOTS,
so DID THE NUN AND THE CHEF FORM A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP.
he WOULD SUPPLY HER AND HER SISTERS WITH EARTHLY DELIGHTS FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
she WOULD SUPPLY HIM WITH HIS FAVORITE INGREDIENT.
often THEY DINED TOGETHER AT LAVISH MEALS.
one NIGHT, HIS GUEST SURPRISED HIM WITH DESSERT.
this IS DELICIOUS.
it's, LIKE, REALLY AMAZING.
that ROTTEN MEAL YOU SAW -- IT WAS TO CELEBRATE OUR ANNIVERSARY.
I DIDN'T HAVE THE HEART TO THROW IT AWAY.
so LARUE NEVER MADE IT TO THE WINGDING.
when HOURS BECAME DAYS,
I WENT INTO THE CATACOMBS TO LOOK FOR HER,
but A WALL BLOCKED MY PATH.
um, TELL ME ABOUT THE LAST TIME YOU SAW LARUE.
did SHE SEEM SCARED, UPSET?
her MOOD WAS JOYOUS.
we MADE LOVE HERE.
and THEN SHE GAVE ME THIS
an ITALIAN WHITE TRUFFLE, THE MOST SOUGHT-AFTER CULINARY DELICACY IN THE WORLD.
its AROMA HAS DRIVEN MEN MAD.
but EMERSON COD'S GAZE WAS NOT ON THE PRICELESS MORSEL KNOWN SCIENTIFICALLY AS TUBER MAGNATUM.
it WAS ON A PIECE OF STATIONERY WHICH BORE THE SAME WORD.
say, COULD YOU, UH, THROW PUPPY A BONE?
CERTNLY.
at $4, 000 A POUND, NO WONDER THEY CALL IT THE DIAMOND OF THE TABLE.
diamond? - YEP.
gotta GO.
listen, WE FIND ANYTHING ELSE OUT, WE'LL JUST POP UP AND, UH, FILL YOU IN, HUH?
LARUE WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.
I WILL NOT REST UNTIL YOU FIND OUT WHO KILLED HER.
you ARE A VILE MAN
who WILL STEW IN THE JUICES OF YOUR SIN FOR ALL ETERNITY.
do NOT TRY TO SEE ME AGAIN.
sister LARUE.
boyfriend's NAME WAS HANSEL VON GETZ.
and THEY WERE TOGETHER, IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE.
sure WERE.
let ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.
she TOOK AN UNDERGROUND TUNNEL TO A RESTAURANT OWNED BY A SWISS CHEF,
who TRADED BLACK-MARKET SWAG FOR TRUFFLES.
nun DUMPS CHEF, CHEF GETS SCARY,
nun GETS SCARED AND WALLS UP THE BASEMENT TUNNEL TO KEEP HIM OUT.
somehow HE FINDS A WAY OUT,
follows HER UP TO THE BELL TOWER,
and IT'S RAINING NUNS.
as FOR THE MYSTERY DIAMONDS,
they're ITALIAN WHITE TRUFFLES
the DIAMOND OF THE TABLE.
except SHE COULDN'T HAVEAD WHITE TRUFFLES.
they ONLY GROW IN ITALY.
everything ELSE SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT, THOUGH, SO GREAT JOB.
peace BE WITH YOU AND ALSO WITH YOU.
that WAS WAY TOO EASY.
Oh, YEAH.
any MINUTE, IT'S ABOUT TO BLOW.
I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.
let's TALK.
why WOULD I WANT TO DO THAT?
because I'M YOUR FRIEND.
Really?
have YOU THOUGHT ABOUT ME ONCE SINCE I LEFT?
go ON.
I'll BE YOUR PUNCHING BAG.
jab ALL YOUR MISPLACED ANGER AWAY.
but YOU SHOULD KNOW CHUCK FEELS AWFUL AND WANTS TO APOLOGIZE.
for WHAT?
I AIN'T MAD AT CHUCK.
I'm MAD AT YOU!
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I HAD FEELINGS FOR YOU!
and WHEN I MADE THOSE FEELINGS KNOWN,
you MADE IT KNOWN THAT YOU DIDN'T FEEL THE SAME WAY.
an AWKWARD PATCH, ABSOLUTELY, BUT WE TALKEABOUT IT, AND IT'S BEHIND US.
no.
it's BEHIND YOU.
you DON'T LIKE MESSY.
you DON'T LIKE FEELING BAD.
so AS SOON AS YOU COULD, YOU JUST MOVED ON AND ABANDONED ME.
well, IF I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET OVER YOU ALL BY MYSELF,
I'd KIND OF LIKE TO DO IT IN A PLACE WHERE I DON'T HAVE TO SEE YOUR FACE EVERY DAY.
but THIS PLACE ISN'T YOU.
you BELONG AT HOME.
this IS MY HOME.
and IF I WE RE TO EVER GO BACK TO HOME, WHICH I WON'T BE, I CAN'T.
what IF I SLIP AND TELL THE SECRET TO CHUCK?
what SECRET?
no SECRET. DID I SAY SECRET?
weird.
I MUST BE SPEAKING IN TONGUES.
Hallelujah!
stop IT.
that's NOT EVEN GOOD GIBBERISH.
this IS WHY I CAN'T BE AROUND ANY OF YOU.
I GET LURED INTO A SENSE OF FAMILIARITY,
and MY -- AND MY LIPS JUST -- JUST LOOSEN UP AND I BLURT!
this IS YOUR LAST WARNING.
please STOP DIGGING.
I WON'T, AND YOU KNOW WHO REALLY WON'T STOP DIGGING WHEN I TELL HER WHAT YOU SAID,
and BELIEVE YOU ME, I'M TELLING?
no, PLE-- OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, NED!
Ned, I'M SWORN TO SECRECY, NED!
what IF I GUESS?
I DON'T GET WHAT I'M LOOKING AT.
look HARDER AND FASTER.
okay, UH, NUNS FROM 29 YEARS AGO -- UM, IS IT HOW MANY NUNS, LIKE A NUMBER PUZZLE?
uh, SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE SACRED FEMININE?
um...
uh, UH, ARE FREEMASONS INVOLVED?
Oh, LORD, HELP ME.
a NUN.
okay.
what? SHE'S FAT?
she's NOT FAT, BUT SHE LOOKS FAT.
she's PREGNANT.
Yes!
Yeah!
did SHE, UH, HAVE HER BABY?
uh, DID SHE HAVE TO GIVE IT UP?
no IDEA WHAT THAT MEANS.
moving ON.
uh, DO YOU KNOW THIS FALLEN NUN PERSONALLY?
you DO. DO I?
I DO? SHE DOESN'T LOOK FAMILIAR.
so...
aunt LILY HAD A BABY 29 YEARS AGO, RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THAT CHUCK WAS BORN.
so CHUCK...
has A COUSIN HER SAME AGE, BUT NOT REALLY HER COUSIN,
because LILY AND VIVIAN AREN'T REALLY HER AUNTS.
you ARE KILLING ME!
not REALLY HER COUSIN, 'CAUSE NOT REALLY HER AUNTS...
cause REALLY HER MOTHER.
Oh, MY GOD.
Lily IS CHUCK'S MOTHER.
Ohh!
the WEIGHT HAS BEEN LIFTED!
let's GO.
that's WHY CHUCK COULDN'T COMPLETE HER FAMILY TREE.
everyone LIED TO HER.
my HEAD IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE.
why DID I MAKE YOU TELL ME?
I TOLD YOU TO STOP DIGGING.
are YOU PAYING FINAL RESPECTS?
you WERE RIGHT...
about DIGGING AROUND IN MY PAST.
digging DID ME NOTHING BUT GET ME SORE ALL OVER.
turns OUT MR. PENNYBAKER IS NO BETTER THAN A THIRD-GRADER.
no FURTHER INFORMATION ON MY DAD AND NO RECORD OF MY MOM.
so I'M A PERSON WITH NO PAST AND NO FUTURE 'CAUSE OF WHAT I AM.
Chuck, I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU -- SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR, UM...
what DO YOU MEAN, "BECAUSE OF WHAT I AM"?
you KNOW, HOW I AM.
I DON'T KNOW.
how AND AT ARE YOU?
and WHY DO I SUDDENLY FEEL CONTRITE?
you KNOW, THE SISTERS ARE SAYING THAT LARUE'S HAUNTING THE BELL TOWER.
they SAY SHE RINGS THE CHIMES TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT SHE'S NOT DEAD,
but SHE'S NOT ALIVE, EITHER.
she's JUST...SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GHOSTS, AND LARUE IS RIGHT HERE.
what IF WE'VE INTERRUPTED THE NATURAL TRANSITION BETWEEN LIFE AND THE AFTERLIFE?
I MEAN, I DIDN'T MOVE ON TO WHERE MOM AND DAD ARE,
and I DIDN'T RETURN TO WHERE I WAS, EITHER.
I'm JUST -- I'M JUST STUCK.
I'm STUCK, AND I'M ABSOLUTELY ALONE,
and I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GO ON LIKE THIS OR EVEN IF I WANT TO.
are Y-- ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT ME TO TOUCH YOU AGAIN?
father MULCAHY, I NEED YOUR HELP.
penance LIST!
one FOR EVERY DAY SINCE I ARRIVED.
by BURNING YOUR BOSSIER-THAN-THOU HANDWRITING INTO MY BRAIN,
these LISTS HAVE DUG YOU A HOLE TO HELL.
know WHY?
cause I ALSO KNOW YOU WROTE THIS!
you JUST STUMBLED ONTOARUE'S CONTRABAND SIDE BUSINESS AND HER AFFAIR WITH CHEF BOYARDEE,
and THEN YOU KILLED HER IN SOME GOD-FEARING RAGE
and LEFT THIS FAKE BREAK-UP NOTE HOPING THAT HER BOYFRIEND WOULDN'T SUSPECT FOUL PLAY,
but, OH, IT WAS FOUL PLAY!
it WAS THE FOULEST OF THE FOUL!
exodus 20: 16
thou SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST THY NEIGHBOR
or PUSH THEM OUT OF BELL TOWERS!
ring A BELL?!
you NEVER COULD GRASP THE MEANING OF THAT VERSE,
but THERE IS TRUTH IN YOUR WORDS.
I DID COMPOSE THAT LETTER.
Oh!
take HER DOWN, FATHER DOWLING!
Yes, FATHER DOWLING -- JUST LIKE YOU DID IN YOUR TV SHOW.
perhaps YOUR ASSOCIATE, "MASH's" FATHER MULCAHY, WOULD LIKE TO HELP.
Oh
I DECIDED TO DO SOME INVESTIGATING AFTER CHATTING WITH YOUR FEMALE COLLEAGUE.
her IGNORANCE OF THE TERM "TAKING THE VEIL" MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPLAINED AWAY BY A SIMPLE SLIP OF THE BRAIN,
but WHEN SHE DOUBTED HER PLACE IN HEAVEN, I BEGAN TO WONDER IF SHE HAD ANY FAITH AT ALL.
a CALL TO THE VATICAN EXPLAINED EVERYTHING.
sister CHRISTIAN IS NOTHING BUT A HEAVY-PETTING POWER BALLAD.
we're MOTORING.
Aah! - OHH!
should WE...
jump IN AND GET IT OVER WITH?
ready WHEN YOU ARE.
I CAT DO THIS AFTER A DAY LIKE TODAY.
Really?
do YOU WANT TO...
Yeah.
so...
all THIS TIME, I THOUGHT MY COLLEAGUES ANI WERE
getting ALONG GREAT, TALKING OUT OUR ISSUES,
and AS IT TURNS OUT, I'M A GIANT DISAPPOINTMENT.
because?
because I DON'T LIKE MESSY, AND I BRING THEM BACK FROM THE...
place THEY WERE.
look, UH, SPECIFICS AREN'T IMPORTANT.
but I WASN'T TRYING TO SCREW UP EVERYONE'S LIFE.
we AREN'T BORN WITH BAD HABITS.
Where'd YOU LEARN THEM FROM, FATHER?
his ENTIRE LIFE, THE PIE MAKER HAD NEVER FELT SAFE POKING AT PATERNAL SCARS,
but IN THE COOL QUIET OF THE CONFESSIONAL AND WITH NOTHING TO LOSE, HE ALLOWED HIMSELF.
my FATHER DESERTED ME IN BOARDING SCHOOL WHEN I WAS 9.
months PASSED WITH NOTHING BUT A POSTCARD.
so...
I WENT TO THE SCHOOL CHAPEL EVERY DAY AND PRAYED -- PRAYED THAT HE WOULD...JUST WALK THROUGH THE DOOR AND...
give ME A HUG AND TELL ME I WAS FORGIVEN FOR...
whatever IT WAS THAT MADE HIM LEAVE.
then HE WAS THE ONE WHO TAUGHT YOU TO RUN.
if I ACT LIKE MY FATHER, IT'S STRICTLY BY COINCIDENCE.
I WOULDN'T KNOW HIM FROM ADAM.
you NEVER TRIED TO REACH OUT, TRACK HIM DOWN?
I SEE NO REASON TO SIFT THROUGH ANCIENT HISTORY WHEN I KNOW EVERYTHING BACK THERE IS ROTTEN.
that's WHAT?
the BOY ABANDONED IN THE CHAPEL IS THE SAME MAN ABANDONING PEOPLE NOW.
if YOU EVER WANT TO CHANGE, YOU'VE GOT TO RECTIFY YOUR PAST.
otherwise YOU WON'T HAVE A FUTURE.
thank YOU...
I GUESS.
now WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHO YOU REALLY ARE?
she ON YOU.
sister OLIVE'S LOCKED IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.
go CALM HER DOWN.
Where's SISTER CHRISTIAN?
Ohh!
Oh, FATHER ED, YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME.
mother SUPERIOR IS A KILLER.
the VATICAN POLICE ARE REALLY THREE DETECTIVES THAT I HIRED.
now, ONE OF THEM IS A PIE MAKER -- SISTER OLIVE, NO MORE OF THIS!
mother SUPERIOR IS A HOLY WOMAN.
now, CALM DOWN AND TRY TO CHANNEL INNER PEACE THROUGH HARD WORK!
you COME DOWN HERE, DUMP OFF YOUR LAUNDRY,
and EXPECT ME TO PRETEND THAT THAT MENOPAUSAL MANIAC'S A SAINT!
EW.
how DOES ONE PERSON GET SO MUCH BAT POO ON THEMSELVES?
Ugh. LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD A BRAWL IN THE...BELL TOWER.
geez LOUISE.
you PUSHED LARUE.
sister OLIVE, LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT I
Hyah!
did YOU FIND THE KEYS?!
I ASSURE YOU, IF I LOCATE ANYTHING KEYISH, YOU ARE THE FIRST PERSON I WILL TELL.
help!
that's OLIVE.
all RIGHT, WE BUSTIN' OUTTA HERE.
at THAT MOMENT, SISTER CHRISTIAN HAD A CRAZY THOUGHT -- IF GHOSTS DID EXIST...
sister LARUE?...
sister LARUE MIGHT BE THE ONE ENTITY WITH WHOM SHE COULD COMMISERATE.
I'm SORRY TO BARGE IN ON YOU LIKE THIS,
but I JUST THOUGHT, IF YOU'RE UP HERE...
you MAY BE FEELING GOD-FORSAKEN.
maybe I COULD, UM...
maybe I COULD DO SOME POLISHING, AND WE CAN -- WE CAN FEEL THAT WAY TOGETHER.
Charlotte CHARLES KNEW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT REMOVING TARNISH,
for SHE HAD SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS POLISHING HER AUNT'S STOCKPILE OF COPPER, BRASS, AND BRONZE CHEESE KNIVES.
the METAL BEFORE HER, HOWEVER, WAS...STAINLESS STEEL...
meaning THE NUN WHOSE CHORE WAS TO POLISH THE BELLS
never NEEDED TO DO SO.
it WAS A REVELATION WHICH MADE THE FOOTPRINT ON THE BOTTOM OF THEUCKET EVEN MORE STRANGE.
if SHE WASN'T POLISHING, WHAT DID SISTER LARUE NEED TO REACH?
Chuck EXPECTED TO HEAR THE DULCET CHIME OF A TINY BELL -- NOT THE THUD...
of SISTER LARUE'S SECRET TRUFFLE LABORATORY.
help!
at THAT MOMENT, CHARLOTTE CHARLES DISCOVERED WHO HAD KILLED SISTER LARUE.
it WAS A SECRET SHE WOULD BE TAKING TO HER GRAVE -- AGAIN.
when BEING CHASED,
olive SNOOK HEARKENED BACK TO AN EDUCATIONAL FILM ON ALLIGATORS ???
run ZIGZAG UNTIL YOU CAN CLIMB A TREE.
up HERE!
sister, I WANTED TO HELP LARUE, NOT HURT HER!
whatever!
Aah!
step AWAY FROM THE DOOR, OR YOU GONNA HAVE COMMUNION WITH YOUR SHOVEL.
please, HELP ME!
Aah!
help ME! - WE'RE COMING!
Oh, GOD!
help!
help, HELP, HELP!
sisters, HELP HIM!
go HELP HIM!
help HIM!
the REST OF US PRAY!
come ON.
Ohh, I GOT YOU!
Ohh, CHUCK, I'M SO SORRY I WAS COLD.
I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT YOU.
and NOW YOU'RE STILL GONNA BE HURT,
and I'M GONNA LOSE THE CLOSEST THING TO A SISTER I HAVE!
Oh, THANK YOU.
that REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME.
if THIS ENDS UP GOING DOWNHILL, I KNOW WHO KILLED LARUE.
I KNOW -- FATHER ED.
no.
no, LOOK.
I WAS HOLDING THE TRUFFLES.
it WAS UNINTENTIONAL, BUT IT'S ENCODED IN HER GENES TO GO AFTER THEM.
Aah!
I'm SLIPPING!
I'm GOING!
PIGBY, PULL!
pull!
PIGBY, PULL!
Ohh!
thank YOU!
of COURSE!
Oh, PIGBY!
Oh, GLORY BE TO G-- AAH!
as SHE FELL, OLIVE WAS OVERCOME BY A SENSE OF PEACE.
she SAID A PRAYER THAT THE PIE MAKER AND CHUCK WOULD BE HAPPY,
that EMERSON WOULD BE RICH,
and THAT A SLICE OF GEORGIA PEACH SERVED HOT WITH CINNAMON ICE CREAM WOULD BE FOREVER KNOWN ON THE PIE HOLE MENU AS AN OLIVE SNOOK.
stupid ASS!
it IS FINISHED, LORD.
take ME HOME.
home IN THIS INSTANCE WAS THE CART HAULED STRATEGICALLY INTO PLACE BY...
Hi.
good CATCH.
the FACTS WERE THESE
Dr. LINDA FRANK, MYCOLOGIST,
was HIRED BY AGRICULTURAL GIANT "I THOUGHT YOU WERE HUNGRY" FOODS FOR ONE MISSION -- THE TEST-TUBE CULTIVATION OF THE ELUSIVE ITALIAN WHITE TRUFFLE.
it WOULD BE A LANDMARK ACHIEVEMENT UNTIL...ALL FUNDING WAS PULLED.
hearing OF THE SISTERS OF THE VINE MAGNATUM'S TRUFFLE FARM,
Dr. FRANK BECAME SISTER LARUE, WHO WOULD USE THE NUNNERY FOR HER OWN GAIN.
she BEGAN WORK ON HER OWN EXPERIMENTS.
but LABS NEED EQUIPMENT, AND SO...
sister LARUE FOUND HER WAY TO HANSEL VON GETZ,
the NEXT VICTIM SHE WOULD EXPLOIT TO KEEP HER RESEARCH GOING.
years PASSED, AND LARUE FINALLY ACHIEVED HER GOAL.
the DISCOVERY WOULD MAKE HER FILTHY RICH, AND SO SHE PLANNED HER EXIT.
on THE EVE OF HER DEPARTURE, SHE BROUGHT HER CHEF A GIFT.
he NEVER REALIZED IT WAS THE EQUIVALENT OF A CULINARY KISS-OFF.
and SHE NEVER REALIZED MOTHER SUPERIOR HAD FOLLOWED HER.
desperate TO BRING A STRAY LAMB BACK INTO THE FOLD, A PLAN WAS HATCHED.
mother SUPERIOR WOULD END THE RELATIONSHIP.
father ED WOULD SAVE LARUE'S SOUL.
the GENTLE PRIEST EXPECTED CONTRITION,
not A MILLION-DOLLAR SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH AND A FALSE NUN POSSESSED BY GREED.
staring INTO THE FACE OF WHAT HE CONSIDERED TRUE EVIL,
the PRIEST ORDERED LARUE TO TAKE HER DISCOVERY AND LEAVE.
as SHE TOOK ONE LAST LOOK AT THE PLACE SHE HAD DESPISED FOR SO MANY YEARS,
LARUE NEVER REALIZED IT WOULD BE THE LAST LOOK SHE WOULD EVER HAVE.
the PRIEST MISTAKENLY ASSUMED THAT HIS CONDEMNATION LED LARUE TO TAKE HER OWN LIFE.
with THE TRUTH UNCOVERED, LIFE RETURNED TO NORMAL AT THE NUNNERY.
Where's DOWLING AND CHRISTIAN?
just BRINGING THE CAR AROUND.
so...
how DID YOUR SISTERS TAKE THE TRUTH ABOUT LARUE?
it WAS ROUGH.
she BETRAYED EVERY SWEET SOUL HERE.
luckily, THIS PARTICULAR SINNER HAD A SILVER LINING -- FOR ALL HER WICKEDNESS, LARUE WAS A FUNGAL GENIUS.
mother SUPERIOR WANTS TO BUILD THE LAB AND CONTINUE HER WORK.
CHA-CHING.
wouldn't HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU DIDN'T INSIST ON DIGGING.
go ON. IT WAS A TEAM EFFORT.
Hey, THEY, UH, TAPPED ME TO BE THE NEW HEAD OF TRUFFLE OPERATIONS.
Ohh, YOU'LL BE GREAT.
because YOU ARE GREAT -- PERSON-WISE.
and YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS,
like WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT US AND HOW, WHEN THINGS GOT MESSY,
I TOOK OFF AND LEFT YOU IN THE DIRT -- NOT LITERALLY, BUT I'M SURE IT FELT THAT WAY.
that's NOT GREAT.
no.
that WASN'T GREAT.
actually, IT WAS AWFUL.
I WAS AWFUL, AND I'M ASHAMED OF MYSELF,
because I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE ABANDONED -- HOW YOU THINK YOU'RE WORTHLESS AND UNLOVABLE
and YOUR HEART HARDENS TO THE PERSON WHO DID IT TO YOU.
forgiving THEM IS INCONCEIVABLE, BUT...
so I KNOW I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ASK FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS,
but I STILL WANT TO TELL YOU...
I-I'm SORRY.
Wow.
I JUST CAME OUT HERE TO SEE IF I COULD CATCH A RIDE HOME, BUT, UM...
that WAS NICE, TOO.
Oh? YOU WANT TO COME HOME?
Oh, MY WORK HERE IS DONE.
of COURSE, I STILL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO AVOID BLABBING LILY'S SECRET TO CHUCK.
well, ONCE I TALK TO HER TONIGHT, IT WON'T BE A SECRET.
I KNOW, BUT...
trust ME.
I DO.
Hey, LET ME GO HAND IN MY HABIT, AND WE'LL HIT THE BRICKS.
are YOU GONNA MISS THIS PLACE?
Yeah.
of COURSE, THEY GAVE ME A LITTLE SOUVENIR.
Ohh.
come ON, PIGBY.
a SECRET THAT WAS 9 MONTHS PLUS 29 YEARS, 11 MONTHS, 2 WEEKS, 5 DAYS, 15 HOURS, AND 45 MINUTES
in THE MAKING S UNDONE IN THREE SECONDS WITH THREE WORDS -- "LILY'S YOUR MOTHER.
now THE PIE MAKER COULD ONLY WAIT FOR A RESPONSE.
are YOU OKAY? YOUR EXPRESSION IS HARD TO READ.
maybe YOU COULD, YOU KNOW...
look AT ME.
tears.
happy ONES.
so YOU TOOK THAT NEWS AND CHOSE TO MAKE IT GOOD?
that's INSPIRING.
makes ME REALIZE I'VE GOT SOME DIGGING OF MY OWN TO DO.
for YOU.
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO FILL IT IN.
my parents were born into the good life.
old money, blue blooded, society sweethearts - Are you hoping for a boy or a girl? - We'll be happy with whatever we have.
having played host to kings and queens and other powers that be, they were used to gracing the pages of the society columns
so they welcomed the attention...
on what they supposed would be the happiest day of their lives.
hang in there. Hold on honey, you can do it.
Oh, my God! l want to be sick! Oh, my God!
but local legend had it that a curse was put on the Willhern family
when my great, great, great grandfather Ralph had a fling with a lowly servant girl... Clara.
who was soon eating for two.
when he told his family of his plans to marry Clara
he realised how sillly he'd been
Clara was after all just a servant girl...
and prone to rashes.
sir Ralph married someone more suitable.
and Clara... fell off a cliff.
that night Clara's mother - the town witch
showed up on the Wilhern lawn determined to give these blue bloods a taste of their own medicine.
she scattered about animal guts and commanded that the next Wilhern daughter be born with the face of a pig.
and only when one of your own kind claims this daughter as their own 'till death do they part' will the curse be broken.
time passed, and as luck would have it the next five Wilhern brides gave birth to all sons...
who fathered all sons... who fathered all sons ...who fathered all sons.
finally, born to Ella and Leonard Hugh Wilhern... a daughter.
a century of worry for nothing.
of course, what they didn't know then was that Ella hadn't actually given birth to a Wilhern.
she had given birth to... a Jones.
which means that the first born Wilhern girl was me.
Penelope. Dear, sweet Penelope l'd given up all hope of ever finding a woman who truly understands me.
l had given up all hope that is... until l met you.
l knew it. He's the one.
he just might be.
you see...
...like you, l felt imprisoned most of my life.
Really? ... By what?
your good looks and your good name?
Yes, exactly.
no one ever seems able to see past that. -No one.
and Penelope.
dear, sweet Penelope...
curse or no curse, if l am more than my name and my face...
well, then, surely you are more than yours?
let me in.
Penelope, let me in.
No!
Hi.
What...?
help me! Help me!
she's a pig!
she's a killer pig!
help me! Somebody help!
why, Penelope? Why?
l'm not the one who ran mother.
well, of course they run dear when you spring yourself at them like that.
do you think l showed your father my mole on our third date?
no dear, no. l had the good sense to wait until after we were married.
mom.
Oh, sweetheart.
he really liked you.
no, Mum, he really didn't.
he didn't like your nose, that's what he didn't like. You're not your nose.
but, it... it is my nose.
No! lt's your great, great, great grandfathers nose.
on your father's side. He did this to you...to us.
but you are not your nose. You are not you.
you're, you're, you're...
somebody else inside just waiting to come out.
l had been reminded over the years that l was not the only victim of the curse.
for starters along with my birth came the knowledge of Aunt Ella's affair.
damn you, Ella!
even so no one suffered more than my mother.
these things happen all the time. -To who?
did you know some children are born with gills?
gills, sweetheart, like on a fish.
so, can you cut it off? -Strangest thing.
but the carotid artery appears to run directly through the nose.
or 'snout', as the case may be.
making any attempt at removal unfeasible.
the, caro... caro... what's that?
what's he saying, Franklin? What, what's he saying?
she would die, sweetheart. He is saying she would die.
l'm sorry. The snout stays.
you...
my mother meant well She always meant well
and always did what she thought best to protect me.
first, from reporters.
what are you?
ow, my eye!
but with the public demanding to see the face that had caused so much trouble.
my mother did what any loving mother would do.
she faked my death.
earth to earth ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.
and had me cremated.
so with the public left to mourn with my tragic passing.
and with me safely hidden away from the outside world.
now she need only worry about protecting me from my father.
who was having trouble adapting to the new morning menu.
why can't l have bacon?
because you love oatmeal.
doesn't Daddy love oatmeal? Yeah.
no, l love bacon.
and from the insensitivity of the new butler Jake.
and this little piggy stayed at home.
and this little piggy had roast beef. . .
Jake! Oh, Jake. Stop it. Oh, the poor baby.
and occasionally she had to protect me, even from myself.
so l did most of my playing in my room...
where l made my own friends.
and learnt to entertain myself.
while my mother spent her every waking hour preparing me.
preparing me to be a suitable bride for the man who would break the curse.
then upon my eighteenth birthday she hired Wanda whose dating agency catered to the best and the brightest blue bloods.
ln hopes of finding one. One of my own kind
who would break the curse by accepting me as l am.
hello.
and upon their depature, they were invited back to the house.
where they were legally gagged into secrecy.
and so it went.
and it was just a matter of time...
before my mother recognised the need for certain adjustments.
shatterproof glass...
and sneakers for Jake.
so you see today...
she's a pig!
...was much like any other. Except...
l couldn't catch him. -Aah! l knew it.
l always said we should make them sign the gag before they see her. Not after.
don't worry. We'll catch him.
we'd better.
a snout?
and fangs.
look, l know what l saw, alright? Now, are you going to arrest her or not?
on what grounds? Ugly blind date?
lf being ugly were a crime, l'd have to arrest half the people in this city.
l know what you're thinking. The Wilherns, nice family right?
that's what l thought. And when Penelope mentioned the curse l thought that was just a figure of speech, yeah.
lt's not a figure of speech. And they're not nice.
l'm telling you if l hadn't of got out of there when l did that...
monster it would have eaten me alive.
that's it. Put him in holding over night.
come on, mate.
what me? No, you don't understand l've come in to report her.
Hey, wasn't that a Vanderman? -Yeah, Edward.
that might be him... no.
okay, you know what? Edward should have been home by now, don't you think?
Hello, anybody? Will somebody call my mother?
rise and shine.
up, up, up, up, up.
come on, dear. We're moving.
mum?
up, up, up, up, up. -What?
we're moving?
where is Larry Bonsa?
security.
poor Edward. l had no idea.
no, not that.
hallucinations of a hideous pig pig faced girl.
you do know who they're talking about?
Oh, l don't know. Could be any number of women in this city.
l'm next in line for chairman of the board.
do you have any idea what a story like this will do to me?
what my father is going to do to me?
well, that's not really my problem.
okay, l'm not a delusional maniac... am l?
no. So, either you print a retraction or so help me god l am going to rip your guts out.
security.
lt'll be twenty five years ago all over again.
reporters popping out of draws. Penelope will be exposed.
and then... what chance do we have?
we could move to the beach. -The beach is good.
or France? -You could practise your French.
l could practice my French.
Merci.
Bonjour. Je suis Penelope.
never mind. l over reacted. Wanda. Wanda!
l demand a retraction. You have ruined my life!
l'm telling you she was a pig. A pig!
l'm telling you she had a piggy snout on her face and l'm not mad.
why will no one believe me?
wait, wait, hold, hold on there, Victor.
l believe that man is with me.
huh? l am?
okay, well first there's Hubert Strauss. -Good. Who else?
Beaux... -Great.
Jack... -Fine.
... the Ripper? -Super, who else?
you know what? Why don't l just say, 'Here's twelve men. Trust me'.
terrific. Let's talk about the dowry. l think we should double it.
lf they can't stand me now what makes you think they'll be able to for double?
Oh, now, now with that attitude... -Oh yeah, it's my attitude, mother.
this guy's got a lot of potential.
l know he's going to look at her.
what do you think of this guy? Do you like him?
Oh, sweetheart.
l know, l know. lt's not my face.
it's my great, great, great grandfathers face and he's not me, and l'm not him and l'm not me.
and don't you forget it.
l gave my right eye for that story.
and l got back squat.
and that hideous woman still gives me nightmares.
l thought you never saw her?
hmm. No, not Penelope. Her mother. l only caught a glimpse of the baby.
l thought my head was playing tricks on me.
well, thank God someone believes me anyway.
unfortunately, my believing you isn't going to do either one of us any good.
we're going to need some proof to clear both our names.
you think you can get back in there?
Oh, l don't... l don't know.
l mean, if...
no.
are you sure? l just need one photo. -l'm not going back in there.
alright. Okay.
we're just going to have find somebody who can.
hook them up with the agency that sent you.
no, they only see old money, blue blood types, it's part of the whole curse thing.
we're not going to find any blue bloods to help us, they don't need the money.
no, but down and out blue bloods do.
check.
bet.
read 'em and weep, losers.
Ah. crap!
you got a Maxwell Campion playing here tonight?
that's him there. Poker table number five.
Hey, pal, wait up.
do l know you?
no, but l know you. Did a little research.
and it seems in a few short years you've managed to gamble away the fortune your family spent generations building.
Hey, hear me out. l'll make it worth your while.
you got the wrong guy.
five thousand bucks worth your while?
we'll need your signature on the last page.
just your standard gag. You don't talk, we don't talk.
just how ugly is this girl?
l believe the young lady is waiting.
wow, this guy is wasting my time.
Oh, he's here.
Hey, man, look, l'm sorry that l'm late. - Alright, yeah. Take off the jacket.
alright.
Hey.
alright, now... hey you with me?
alright, the camera is in the lapel. The rigging is in the sleeve. Put it on.
come on, it looks great on you.
now to take a picture you just raise either arm.
not now.
alright. Look, l'm sorry, man.
Yeah, l know you are. Did you have to gamble all night?
Yeah, l still had chips. l'm good?
Yeah. Let's... come on, let's go.
don't worry, l'll get that.
and you are?
l'm Max Campion and the agency sent me.
Oh, right. Campion. -There you go ...shit.
excuse me?
God Damn!
alright, dear, we've done as you asked. They're all in the annexe.
all of them? All of them.
but why you wouldn't rather talk to them one at a time is beyond me.
l told you mother this way it will be easier to weed out the unlikelys.
Hello, l'm Penelope. And you must be?
late for tea?
they're out, they're, they're running... They've all seen her.
Where's Max?
Edward, do you see Max?
l don't see Max. He's not there. There's no Max.
how could you? -Just speeding things up.
Oh, and now you're just going to make a pig of yourself?
no, that's already been done for me. -Stop it.
that was the last of the ho-hos.
Where's your credit card? l'm going to the store.
no, no, no don't you... hey!
lf you want more ho-ho's l'll send Jake for some.
l'm old enough to get my own.
pick me up some cigarettes.
Penelope, just one man, one man.
and he'll run too. They always run why can't you accept that?
for seven years l've been watching them run.
do you have any idea how that makes me feel? Do you?
l'm sorry, but we just can't quit.
yes we can because. . .
no matter how much l want to believe there's one man who won't run away one man who...
sweet loving angel of all things merciful.
did he see?
he must have. He was there.
who is he? -Who cares? Just go!
Yes, go. -No, l can't...
go! -Go!
damn it.
you're still here?
did you see? See?
you didn't see? l didn't?
did you? Did l what?
don't mess with me. What? l'm messing with you?
why are you still here? Still?
fine then, why are you here?
look l'm sorry. Should l go?
are you a fan of George Rockham?
who?
the book you've got in your jacket.
Oh, alright. You caught that, huh?
well... yeah. Yeah, it's a great book.
so you've read it?
well, yeah.
funny l thought that was the only surviving copy.
you know what? l meant to read it, but the library was always out l saw it was a first edition and l figured it might be worth something.
so you were stealing it?
well... Yeah. l was stealing it.
so, you're a fan of the money?
l'm a big fan of the money. Although, it doesn't much care for me.
well, maybe you and the money weren't meant to be.
Hey, l wouldn't go that far. Jinx me.
there are 326 first editions in that room.
of those, 300 are worth over 50, 000.
a dozen or so are worth over 25, 000.
and l'm afraid there's only one that's valued under a hundred.
only one, huh?
a little novel, written by a little nobody, that never amounted to anything.
you don't say. Under a hundred?
l'm afraid so. And... l'm afraid that it's time for...
but it's your favourite just the same? -What?
l said, 'your favourite just the same'.
l heard you.
top shelf, third from the left, 'Moby Dick'. lt's a first edition.
but wait till l'm gone or they'll see you.
see me?
what?
Hello?
Hello?
got you!
no?
will you be back tomorrow?
l knew it. l knew you were there.
Yeah.
he'll be back. - He will.
so? -l didn't get it.
how could you not get it, half the men in this city...
relax. l'm coming back tomorrow.
Ow! Door.
you better.
see you tomorrow.
better.
sweetheart? What's wrong?
l thought he just knew, but it says it right here.
still he chose it.
of the 2, 000 that aren't your favourite, he chose the one that is.
alright. Alright.
do you play?
l wish you'd stop doing that.
do you play? -The frog?
no, no although l always meant to pick it up.
but you do play something.
what makes you say that? -What do you play?
guess.
ls this really necessary?
she's finding his instrument.
lsn't that something a man should do for himself?
and a one, and a two, and a one.
you are my sunshine, my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are grey.
you'll never know, dear dear how much l love you.
are you even playing that?
so please don't take my sunshine away.
okay, it's not the bass. - No? No?
try the drums. -Alright.
the drums, you play drums.
okay.
so please don't take... my sunshine away.
okay, okay, no, no, no. No more drums.
no? Not the drums, it's not the drums...
alright!
saxophone, saxophone!
you want sax?
one... two... one, two.
enough, stop. Stop, stop!
enough. -No? No, alright.
play the guitar. The guitar.
guitar. lt's got to be the guitar.
l don't think that's how you play the guitar.
okay, stop, stop. stop! Please stop, stop.
Oh, my. That was, that was terrible.
hey everybody, everybody wave.
everybody wave to Penelope and take a bow, alright? And bow.
l know, l know you guys you were fantastic though come here. Thank you so much for everything.
wait, wait l'm not done guessing.
come on, enough about me. What do you play?
you want to be a hortomacultural what?
a horticulturalist. You know? Someone who works with plants.
right.
why is that funny?
no plants are great. l just thought of you as like... like a cop.
you know seeing as you've got the whole interrogation thing down.
shut up, it's your move.
alright.
Oh, you really don't want to do that. -Why not?
because l'll kill her. -What if l asked you not to?
l'd still kill her. You'd sort of be begging me to.
so, beer. You've never had a beer?
l've had a beer.
on tap? -No, not on tap.
well, then you've never had a beer.
your knight can't do that. -My knight?
the horse. -Alright.
Hey, how about you and me heading down to the Cloverdilly pub right now?
pub Cloverdilly?
best beer, best blues, some of the best beer bums in town.
Thanks, maybe later.
Penelope, come on.
come on, you've got to get out of there sometime.
right?
what are you waiting for?
you know, truth is, you're. you're not missing much.
Really? The Cloverdilly pub sounds fun.
Yeah, but... aside from that.
and the street fairs? l hear they sell really cool stuff right on the street.
you know, the vendors themselves are pretty cool too.
Oh, and the park? -The park is great.
l used to spend every weekend there just hanging on a bench writing stupid love songs...
people watching. -Used to? You don't do that anymore?
what are you doing instead?
well, beating you at chess. -l warned you l'd kill her.
that's great because as soon as my guys here have seen what you've done...
the game will be over, your queen will be dead.
my king's still pretty active, you know?
once the queen's dead the kings useless.
what's that about? -l don't know?
maybe he's too depressed to fight. He really loved her you know?
Yeah, l can see that.
my queen to yours, checkmate.
you got me.
man, what is this guy doing?
wasting all my film.
he's doing it on purpose. He's going for the dowry.
l wish l could find a girl with a dowry.
give me a break.
why else would it be taking you so long? She revealed herself to me straight away.
you know what? l guess she liked you more.
why settle for five thousand when you could get ten times that, right?
well, maybe you're forgetting l've seen her. She is grotesque.
shut him up.
l'm talking un-kissable ugly. Nightmare ugly.
listen you little worm. l know your kind spoiled rotten mama's boy...
God! He licked me.
Edward. -What?
don't lick Max.
sorry.
listen you can't blame us for being a little suspicious.
fine, find someone else. -Fine, give us back the money.
lt's starting. lt's starting! Would you come on!
okay, l've got it. Piano.
you play the piano. l bet my life on it.
alright, keep in mind; 'never bet a better'.
does he have another jacket?
and a one, and a two and a one...
you are my sunshine...
my only sunshine...
b flat on the right hand.
no, right hand!
you see, the left hand stays, and the right hand plays the chord.
you see? -Yeah, yeah. lt's better.
shit! -l'm a monster.
no, no your not, Penelope!
stay with Max.
darling, do not... Please, do not...
l told you! l told you!
no, you ran. lt was you this time.
he said 'shit' -Big shit.
he said 'shit' to me twice.
and then he just stood there staring at me.
no one's ever just stood there before.
lf you give the poor boy a chance to adjust. l mean, put yourself in...
what are you doing? l told you to stay with him.
you did? l didn't hear you.
when you said, 'stay with Max'...
l meant stay with Max.
you never said, 'Wanda, stay with him'.
l told you! -l'm sorry l didn't hear you.
mom?
don't worry, dear. He couldn't have gone far -Did you get it? -Yeah. Yeah, l got it.
Hey, l needed that photo.
she's not what Edward said she was. You just leave her alone.
who is that? -Lock the gate!
no, don't, don't shut the gate!
l got him, l got him.
Penelope, there's something l have to tell you.
no, he's a spy. -No... yes.
Yes, he's a spy. He's working for Lemon,
the reporter who forced me to bury you.
you said l was cremated. -That too.
l hope you were well paid, because you just said goodbye to a fortune.
wait! He's still one of your own kind.
he could still break the curse.
Max. l know this face repulses you...
and l ... and l wouldn't dream of asking you to accept it.
but this isn't me.
the real me is inside here somewhere just waiting to get out.
and you can make that happen.
once the curse is broken l'll be just like anybody else.
what if you're not? What if the curse isn't broken.
what if ...what if the curse can never be broken?
then l'll kill myself. l promise. l promise l will.
marry me, Max.
marry me.
l can't.
get out!
l'm... -Get out!
get out! -Out!
right out!
okay, this is what we're going to do...
l felt the rush of a thousand heart breaks.
this is nothing we haven't been through before.
Penelope, we can do it again.
l will never give up, sweetheart.
never, Penelope!
and l knew with all my heart she meant it.
we have both always known there was no guarantee.
we have not both always known that there was no guarantee.
we have spent so much time preparing her for the day things would be different, we've never prepared her for the day that they're not.
maybe we should stop all this match making and ...
give her a puppy. Hmm?
sweetheart? Penelope is that you?
Yes, mother. l'm just going to make some cocoa.
a puppy.
okay. -What can l say?
l'm sorry you got stuck with me. l'm sorry l dragged you down with me.
l know l'm the bad blood. l am the Wilhern. l know that.
the curse is on me. l am the curse.
me, lt's me, it's me l, me, me, me.
honey. Honey! l think your father could use some cocoa too.
okay mother.
actually l might have a cup too.
she's escaped.
let's go. -God, she's going to be coming after me.
Edward, you've got to control yourself. -Quick!
what are you doing? -We need help.
Yes, l'd like to report my daughter missing.
are you out of your mind? What if they find her?
for crying out loud Jessica!
okay, you know what? l can't hold it any longer. Come with me.
l have to pee and l can't leave you alone with the phones.
you know dear, there was a time...
when l might have jumped at such an invitation, but right now l can't.
hello - Mum?
hold the line, please. - Mum?
collect call from Penelope... - Yes, we'll accept - Mum? Go ahead with your call, please.
hello...
Penelope, what the hell were you thinking?
did anyone see you yet? No...Mum, no
good, good. Where are you? We'll come and get you.
l'm just calling to say that l love you, and... goodbye.
Penelope don't...
at least we know she's alright.
don't you have to pee or something? -No, dear, that was you.
l can check you in over here.
hi...
can l have a room, please?
shouldn't be a problem. Room 8 is available.
thank you. -You don't want the room?
no, l, l want the room.
then would you mind coming back here so l can check you in?
thank you. And how will you be paying for your room?
thank you, Jessica
okay, that's it for me, folks. New dealer coming in.
erm, nostrils are bigger. More... more piggy.
Hey, hey. Guys, guys, come on. We've got to wrap this up.
l've got a deadline here. We've got to go to print.
crosser, crosser... -Freakin' Mona Lisa come on...
your morning paper, madam. -Oh, thanks, Jake.
holy magda! Aaaah!
damn it, Edward ! -Dad, they all think l'm crazy.
and this helps you? How?
you told me. l thought this would prove...
try to remember l'm your son.
that's exactly what l'm trying to forget.
thank you, ma'am. Gentlemen.
so, how's everybody doing this fine day?
l thought you went home.
l did. Slept for eight blissful hours, fixed the kids breakfast, kissed the wife goodbye, and, according to the button, it's your blind.
you want to take your blind?
are you in or out?
Hey, he's still got chips. He's in.
just give him some time. He's in. He'll come around.
Yeah, l'll take another. Make it a large one.
Hey, he's still got chips. He's in
for starters, l'm going to need a recent photograph.
no photographs. -None whatsoever?
no. The er...fire got them.
OK, a detailed description.
brown hair.
brown eyes.
a unique...ly pleasant personality.
think pig.
so she's a fat girl? -Not exactly.
Jessica! Not in front of company.
don't be silly. He knows l didn't mean it.
that's not true, madam.
l may not have said anything, but l was filing it away.
so she's not exactly fat?
does any of this really matter? Just go find her!
our daughter's out there somewhere, lost and afraid
you haven't given me anything to go on.
no photographs, no friends, no job, no hangouts...
lt's something like this, but minus the fangs.
Franklin! -Do you want to find her or not?
minus the fangs.
they're certainly eye-grabbing.
Jake, purse.
OK, you know what? Never mind. How much do we owe you?
Where's my...?
who took my wallet?!
lt's our daughter. Please help us. Please, l'm begging you.
what he's trying to say is, give us the key now!
l'm sorry, but...
the room is registered in my name with my. . .
who's the guest? Me. That makes me the guest.
you two go on ahead. Not real big on the fang thing.
well, at least we know she's not starving.
no, not...not just...not just any pig.
you need to stop talking now.
Hello?
Yeah, that's right...
Penelope? -Who is this?
that was Penelope on the...
sell her own picture?
Er...then why did you hang up?
Edward, what's...what's wrong with you? Did you ever...?
how did you know it was me?
just a lucky guess. You have something you want to sell us?
that's right.
may l ask why you are doing this?
what do you care? You're getting a freak.
Hey, nobody said anything about a freak.
listen, do you want it or not? -Sure. Yes.
Yes. Yes, l do. Thank you.
look, Grandma, a pig! -How nice.
fangs?
there are no fangs.
l know and you know. Maybe that's enough.
lemon, half the people in this city think l'm crazy.
l've got to prove to them that l'm not.
l'm sorry. l've got to do it.
ladies and gentlemen, l give you the pig-faced girl.
you see? l'm not crazy.
am l crazy? You, am l crazy? l'm not crazy.
you weren't kidding!
can l get you something?
can l have a beer on tap, please?
sure. You can have this one.
coming right up.
you're supposed to catch it. -Oh, sorry.
are you ready now?
there you go. -Thank you.
ls there a problem?
do you have any straws? -Sure.
there you go.
that's half of what you gave me.
you'll get the rest back when l'm ready.
let's just call it even. -No, let's not.
she's not some freaking pay day.
she sold me the photo herself.
Yeah. Apparently, she's... out there on her own, declaring her independence.
hey there, Jack. -Annie!
lucky you, last delivery of the day.
how are you doing?
l'm just asking. -So l'm driving my Vespa, and this guy comes out of nowhere and hits me. l go flying.
l'm in the street and he's stands over me and he's, like, 'l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l didn't see.
how can he not see me, you know? l'm on a Vespa with wings.
l mean, right, you can see me. You can see me, right?
what?
see? She can see me.
you ought to sic Billy on him.
Yeah, it's a little too late. You've got to sign here.
Billy moved back to the burbs. -Yeah? Sorry to hear it.
Yeah. We had no business being together. He was a picket fence kind of guy.
and, like, what guy looks at me and thinks picket fence.
unless he's crazy, and l'm done dating crazy, you know? Done.
unless it's meant to be. Right?
Yeah. Right.
right? -Right.
l can't hear you with that thing on your face.
the usual. On the house.
Thanks, Jack. You're the best.
Cheers.
so, what? Are you hiding from the law, or is that a bad nose job?
Mm-hm. Bad nose job.
do you mind me asking how much that might cost somebody, like a nose job?
Oh, nothing. -Free?
l was just thinking maybe... getting a little work done myself.
a nose job?
Yeah, kind of, but for like for my ears, you know?
they just, stick out up here a little on the top. l mean, l'm no Penelope, but...
no, you have beautiful ears. Beautiful. They're beautiful.
what, are you drunk? -l'm drunk.
Hey, Jack, how about another round for my pal, Scarfy, here?
coming up.
what's a Vespa?
what's a V...? You've never ridden on a Vespa?
Hey, Sam, long time no see. -Wow, look who's back.
Look...have you seen the guys around?
they're touring, opening for some band who's supposed to be good.
no kidding? That's.that's great. -What brings you back here?
Oh, you know... looking around.
actually, l thought it was maybe time l started playing again.
yeah? Well, good luck with that, eh?
look, come on, Sam, l wouldn't even ask if...
you are joking, ain't you? After all your no-shows?
l only look stupid.
look, l messed up. know, and l'm sorry.
let's just say l didn't appreciate a good thing when l had it.
Oh, and now you do? -Now l do.
still got your scarf on.
all right, hop on.
all right, l gotta go down the street.
Oi! Mozart!
Yeah. Listen, l'm sorry. lt won't happen again.
don't muck about.
you can take your whole face off. My brother once was like, he was just riding his bicycle, and he hit this, like, parked car, and he was so freaked out about seeing his teeth in the hood, and, like, his whole face was bleeding then he got back on the bicycle and he went to the movies...
look! Helleborus orientalis.
they're amazing. They bloom even in the winter.
Oh, that's cool.
they just pop up without any help from anyone.
that's like my ex-boyfriend, if you know what l mean.
you know what l mean, right?
Really?
you don't get out much, do you?
we should talk.
another postcard. -l don't care.
what's it say? Went ice skating.
stop. l don't care.
circus. -lt's been months.
zoo.
how could she be doing all these things without being seen?
she can't! That's how.
Oh, honey, what are we going to do?
that's her scarf! Look.
no, she went that...
this is really good.
Oh, great. You're here. lt's your turn to buy.
all right, l lied. l'll buy.
Oh, my God!
somebody pull this scarf off her. She can't breathe.
they're not running.
Ah! No! Penelope, no! No, no, no, dear! Turn away!
she's coming out!
there she is!
Penelope, this way! This way, Penelope!
ls it true you were chained up in the basement?
don't encourage them.
Penelope, do you have any other pig parts?
with such a large nose, do you smell better than the rest of us?
l don't know. You tell me.
mom, can l borrow some money? l'm running low.
absolutely not. You get in that car.
mom, they want to know if you chained me up in the basement.
like, after three weeks, l was like, l knew something was up.
nose jobs only take so long, you know.
no, of course not.
Bye, darling. -Bye.
let it go, dear.
Penelope, is there anything you'd like to say to the public?
Er...hi.
mr Vanderman!
ls it true you attempted to file assault charges against Penelope?
l've obtained the police report.
no comment, please. Ladies and gentlemen.
lt's OK. l can handle it.
that woman, that thing, belongs in a cage.
what a creep. -Excuse me.
have you lost your mind?
you saw her. She's a complete monster.
the public loves this girl.
they don't know her like l do. -We're a publicly traded company.
we love what the public loves. Get it?
so, what are you saying?
l'm saying you've got to fix this.
l don't know what you expect me to do.
just fix it!
come on, Penelope, you're on my team!
OK, but l'm not very good.
come on, come on, come on.
l told you l wasn't very good.
Hi. -Hi.
you really did it, huh?
l mean, er... you look great, you know, really happy.
Thanks.
Yeah. You know, you inspired me.
doing what you did, going off on your own like that.
l er...l'm not... -l have to go.
Yeah, sure. l just...
Oh, darling, l am so glad l found you!
you must come home right now!
l have the most wonderful surprise.
OK, Mom, but l really should get back.
Penelope. What is this?
listen, l'm sorry l ran from my feelings.
Oh, is that what you were running from?
l was certain you were running from me.
only my feelings for you.
ls this a joke? -Penelope, don't make the boy beg.
look at that face. He can break the curse.
but things are different now, Mother. l...
she's overwhelmed.
Why? Because you're splattered all over the newspapers?
no, because l have friends.
those aren't friends, dear. Those are fans.
did you hear? The pig speaks ten languages.
Oh, look, the pig can play the piano.
you're just a talking pig to those people. A talking pig.
edward wants to marry you.
are you prepared to walk away from your one and only chance?
our one and only chance at a normal life?
will you marry me, Penelope?
Hey, Lemon.
l thought you might be able to help me with this Max Campion story l'm doing.
well, what's the story?
l'm doing this kind of riches to rags to armed robbery story.
armed robbery? Come on? Max Campion?
Yeah. l just got the call. He's already confessed.
what?
pick it up.
you the lawyer my mother sent?
there's been a mistake. l'm here to see Max Campion.
Yeah, hey, l'm Max Campion.
no, you're not. -Yes, l am.
no, Max Campion.
l am not deaf. l can hear you. l am Max Campion.
but you're...
what about the guy you play poker with?
shaggy hair, er...medium build.
doesn't know when to quit.
Ah! Er...is Johnny Martin. -Johnny Martin?
Johnny Martin. Poor loser.
get that down, Martin, in the pirate pad there
do you have...? Hey, don't!
Oh, that was so wonderful. Was it not wonderful?
Yes, wonderful.
we have to do this again.
now that we're nearly family, l think this is just the beginning.
Yes. l'll fetch the limo. -Good, good, good.
can l have my coat, please?
Oh, Franklin, we used to go out to the theatre all the time. Why did we stop?
l guess because we had an ugly daughter.
lt's true, Jessica. We gave up everything because we had an ugly daughter.
let me help you with that, sir. -Thank you.
lt's just over there. -OK, we're going.
but my coat! -Fine, we'll get you another one.
Edward, what are you doing? Where are we going?
Max. -Hello, Penelope.
we were just leaving.
Hey, how are things, Edward? -Keep walking.
l understand it got a bit grotesque there for a while, even puke ugly.
but... You two know each other? -As a matter of fact, we do.
Yale, wasn't it?
no, l believe it was a Bedford, a Bedford van to be...
stop! Haven't you hurt her enough?
bathroom. Now. -Edward, l...
why don't you let Edward handle this? -But, Mother...
you make me sick!
Why? l'm giving her exactly what she wants.
and l don't see anybody else lining up to do that.
Oh, unless...unless you are. Are you lining up?
that's not the point. -Yeah, it is. Yes, it is the point!
look, if you want to go out there and tell her that the only man willing to stand up and say, 'l do,'
still gags at the thought of kissing her, then be my guest, but it's not me you'll be hurting.
lt's her, isn't it?
son of a plumber, huh? -lt sure took you long enough.
boy, you sure fooled me.
so, it looks like you were doing her a favour after all.
you seen this? -Hmm. Cute couple.
Yeah. Penelope and the beast.
Hey, they're both getting what they want, right?
l know what he's getting. What's she getting?
well, she's getting the day she's waited for all her life, breaking the curse.
Oh, you don't actually believe that, do you?
well, don't you?
what the hell have you been chasing all these years?
l don't know. A wounded ego and a missing eye, l guess.
come on, a curse?
Yeah. Who knows? You know, you spend enough time around a poker table, you believe in all sorts of things.
Hey, it's not too late to stop Edward.
that's what she wants.
wait. lf getting married is all it takes to break the 'ooh, the curse,'...
why not you?
you're forgetting, man. l'm not Max. -So?
one of their own kind.
Hey! Over here! l saved you a seat! lt's clean.
Hey, Annie, look at you.
weddings are great, aren't they?
Yeah. When they're somebody else's.
Jessica, l need a word.
excuse me.
what's the matter? ls there a problem?
and Edward seems really nice.
mom, l think l'm going to throw up.
just remember, in a few minutes from now, the curse will be broken.
there is no curse. The only one cursed here is me.
for starters... -Losing your eye was your own damn fault.
now what? - l just wanted to apologise.
apology not accepted.
what? l have a wedding to go to!
meet Johnny Martin.
l told you not to rush the process.
this doesn't change a thing.
how can you say that? Not only was Edward part of...
as you yourself once said, he's still one of our own kind.
OK, fine. What about Max, or Johnny or whatever his name is?
what about him?
don't you think Penelope's entitled to know?
that he lied about everything?
that he doesn't have the power to break the curse.
why on earth would she need to know that?
don't you see? Maybe that's the only reason he said no.
l don't know that. You don't know that. But if that's true,
God bless him, he did the right thing.
damn it, Jessica, l can't just... -Leave it alone.
not that l'm not happy for her. l'm really happy for her.
you're happy for her, right?
lf she's happy, l'm happy. -Right.
mom, l feel stupid. -Oh, you don't look stupid.
you look...
you don't look stupid.
do you, Edward Vanderman take Penelope Wilher to be your lawfully wedded wife?
to have and to hold, for better or for worse for richer or for poorer in sickness and in health.
to love and to cherish from this day forward until death do you part?
l do.
and do you, Penelope Wilhern, take Edward Humphrey Vanderman lll to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, for better or for worse for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish from this day forward until death do you part?
nobody move! She's fine!
Penelope, wait! Penelope! Stop!
look at me.
l am. What is it, dear?
no, look at me.
l am! What? l don't understand! What do you mean?
you... l'm sorry.
Penelope, it's not too late.
go away, Mother!
honey, just think about what you're doing.
this is the moment we have worked so hard for.
l said go away!
sweetheart, please! Please!
we are one yes away from a whole new life.
a whole new you!
but l don't want a whole new me, Mother!
sweetheart, please! Please!
l like myself the way l am.
lt's not going to grow back.
what makes you think l... -l miss it too.
and then l remembe you're still you.
Oh, Penelope...
one of your own kind. l just assumed...
no, we all did, Mother.
no, dear. No. Don't you see?
l could have broken the curse years ago if l'd just done my job as your mother, and loved you as my own.
you didn't know. You didn't know.
Oh, look.
you know, darling, with the carotid artery out of the way, l think a little turn up might, right there, be sweet. Look at that.
what? You're crazy.
Oh, it's wrong for a young woman to want to look her best?
that's not a bad thing...
what? l'm being her mother.
that's what mothers do with daughters!
they talk about how to look prettier.
still, l felt sad for my mother that day...
why are you turning it around? Oh, now l'm the bad guy!
...having to cope with so many changes all at once.
lt all went back to shit!
l was packing to go, and after 25 years with the family...
Jake, where are you going? Jake, l'm talking to you. Jake?
and why do you have that bag? Jake! Don't be rude!
you turn around when l'm talking to you, please.
l happen to be...
there, there, now. There, there.
but l had my own changes to cope with, and, while l missed the face that had caused so much trouble...
...the world had moved on.
...and l was determined to find my own way, and determined to always follow my heart...
look! My daffodil bloomed!
and l found Helleborus orientalis!
...and my conscience.
dear Edward, that first day in the library, you said that you too have felt imprisoned most of your life.
looking back, l now believe you were speaking from your heart.
l fear l did you a terrible disservice that day l knew you would run l wanted you to, but perhaps if l had taken the time to really listen to you, maybe we could have helped each other find our way.
l'm sorry. l hope this lette and this ring finds you well.
Edward? Edward? Your father wants to know what you're doing in there.
and then came Halloween.
okay, everybody. We're going to start in about ten minutes, so l need you all to go and get your costumes on. OK?
just get changed and line up by the front door as quick as possible.
Hey! Hey! No fighting.
l can be whoever l want! -Girls, please.
but she knew l was going to be Penelope.
all right, girls, you're going to have to go out with the rest of the class.
go and line up. Come on, line up. Get ready to go. Come on.
Alice? Honey, what's wrong?
everybody's Penelope, and l'm a stupid static cling!
Oh... Well, frankly, l find you quite refreshing.
come on, sweetie. Stick with me and we'll both make it through this.
trick or treat!
well, hello there.
l love this one. These are my favourites. -Jess, you're going to want to see this.
ls this too much?
Bye.
and then Wanda couldn't hold on to the secret any longer.
you're everywhere. Are you freaking out or what?
OK, 357. -There it is.
hold on.
what?
lt's just kind of great to see the old you.
OK. All right, let's go. -All right, here we go.
you can do this. Are you ready?
Hi. Um...l...
she's gotta pee. You got a bathroom? l'm going to get some punch.
Er...yeah. Yeah, sure. l guess it's OK. Come on in.
lt looks like a good party.
why aren't you at the party?
l gotta pack.
so, are you moving?
Er...out-of-town job. l felt like getting out of the city for a while.
away from the crowds?
Yeah, the crowds at the poker tables.
Oh, so you're a gambler?
ex. Avoiding temptation.
well, that's good.
good for you. l er.
l had a friend once who um...liked to gamble.
at least, well, l heard he liked to gamble, -And, he had to stay away from. . . -Take off the mask.
what?
l'm sorry.
all Halloween, l've been running into...
well, someone l used to know. Sorry. Ridiculous.
this someone, she meant a lot to you?
Yes.
Yes, she did.
what happened?
l couldn't give her what she wanted.
what did she want?
to be free.
you shit!
you lied to me! l guessed piano, and you said...
Penelope, l'm sorry. -l know.
no. l don't have the power to break the curse.
lt's OK. lt turns out that l did.
lt's me, Max.
my name's Johnny.
l know. Johnny. l'm still me.
so, there we were.
and we lived happily ever after.
well, happily ever after so far at least.
l don't get it. What does it mean?
well, what do you think it means? -Rich people suck!
lt's always the mother's fault.
we're all cursed?
lt's not the power of the curse, it's the power you give the curse.
what did you say, Shrimp? -He's not a shrimp, dummy.
he is too a shrimp! -Hey! That's not nice!
that's very good, Billy.
my parents were born into the good life.
old money, blue blooded, society sweethearts - Are you hoping for a boy or a girl? - We'll be happy with whatever we have.
having played host to kings and queens and other powers that be, they were used to gracing the pages of the society columns
so they welcomed the attention...
on what they supposed would be the happiest day of their lives.
hang in there. Hold on honey, you can do it.
Oh, my God! I want to be sick! Oh, my God!
but local legend had it that a curse was put on the Willhern family
when my great, great, great grandfather Ralph...
had a fling with a lowly servant girl... Clara.
who was soon eating for two.
when he told his family of his plans to marry Clara
he realised how sillly he'd been
Clara was after all just a servant girl...
... and prone to rashes.
sir Ralph married someone more suitable.
and Clara... fell off a cliff.
that night Clara's mother - the town witch
showed up on the Wilhern lawn determined to give these blue bloods a taste of their own medicine.
she scattered about animal guts and commanded that the next Wilhern daughter be born with the face of a pig.
and only when one of your own kind claims this daughter as their own 'till death do they part'
will the curse be broken.
time passed, and as luck would have it the next five Wilhern brides gave birth to all sons...
who fathered all sons... who fathered all sons ... who fathered all sons.
finally, born to Ella and Leonard Hugh Wilhern... a daughter.
a century of worry for nothing.
of course, what they didn't know then was that Ella hadn't actually given birth to a Wilhern.
she had given birth to... a Jones.
which means that the first born Wilhern girl...
... was me.
Penelope. Dear, sweet Penelope
I'd given up all hope of ever finding a woman who truly understands me.
I had given up all hope that is... until I met you.
I knew it. He's the one.
he just might be.
you see...
...like you, I felt imprisoned most of my life.
Really? ...By what?
your good looks and your good name?
Yes, exactly.
no one ever seems able to see past that. - No one.
and Penelope.
dear, sweet Penelope...
curse or no curse, if I am more than my name and my face...
well, then, surely you are more than yours?
let me in.
Penelope, let me in.
No!
Hi.
What...?
help me! Help me!
she's a pig!
she's a killer pig!
help me! Somebody help!
why, Penelope? Why?
I'm not the one who ran mother.
well, of course they run dear when you spring yourself at them like that.
do you think I showed your father my mole on our third date?
no dear, no. I had the good sense to wait until after we were married.
I didn't show him my mole, mother. I showed him my face.
mom.
Oh, sweetheart.
he really liked you.
no, Mum, he really didn't.
he didn't like your nose, that's what he didn't like. You're not your nose.
but, it... it is my nose.
No! It's your great, great, great grandfathers nose.
on your father's side. He did this to you... to us.
but you are not your nose. You are not you.
you're, you're, you're...
somebody else inside just waiting to come out.
I had been reminded over the years that I was not the only victim of the curse.
for starters along with my birth came the knowledge of Aunt Ella's affair.
damn you, Ella!
even so no one suffered more than my mother.
these things happen all the time. - To who?
did you know some children are born with gills?
gills, sweetheart, like on a fish.
so, can you cut it off? - Strangest thing.
but the carotid artery appears to run directly through the nose.
or 'snout', as the case may be.
making any attempt at removal unfeasible.
the, caro... caro... what's that?
what's he saying, Franklin? What, what's he saying?
she would die, sweetheart. He is saying she would die.
I'm sorry. The snout stays.
you...
Oh...that's not true.
my mother meant well She always meant well
and always did what she thought best to protect me.
first, from reporters.
what are you?
ow, my eye!
but with the public demanding to see the face that had caused so much trouble.
my mother did what any loving mother would do.
she faked my death.
earth to earth ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.
and had me cremated.
so with the public left to mourn with my tragic passing.
and with me safely hidden away from the outside world.
now she need only worry about protecting me from my father.
who was having trouble adapting to the new morning menu.
why can't I have bacon?
because you love oatmeal.
doesn't Daddy love oatmeal? Yeah.
no, I love bacon.
and from the insensitivity of the new butler Jake.
and this little piggy stayed at home.
and this little piggy had roast beef...
Jake! Oh, Jake. Stop it. Oh, the poor baby.
and occasionally she had to protect me, even from myself.
so I did most of my playing in my room...
where I made my own friends.
and learnt to entertain myself.
while my mother spent her every waking hour preparing me to be a suitable bride for the man who would break the curse.
then upon my eighteenth birthday she hired Wanda whose dating agency catered to the best and the brightest blue bloods.
in hopes of finding one. One of my own kind
who would break the curse by accepting me as I am.
hello.
and upon their depature, they were invited back to the house.
where they were legally gagged into secrecy.
and so it went.
and it was just a matter of time...
before my mother recognised the need for certain adjustments.
shatterproof glass...
and sneakers for Jake.
so you see today...
she's a pig!
... was much like any other. Except...
I couldn't catch him. - Aah! I knew it.
I always said we should make them sign the gag before they see her. Not after.
don't worry. We'll catch him.
we'd better.
a snout?
and fangs.
look, I know what I saw, alright? Now, are you going to arrest her or not?
on what grounds? Ugly blind date?
if being ugly were a crime, I'd have to arrest half the people in this city.
I know what you're thinking. The Wilherns, nice family right?
that's what I thought. And when Penelope mentioned the curse
I thought that was just a figure of speech, yeah.
it's not a figure of speech. And they're not nice.
I'm telling you if I hadn't of got out of there when I did that...
monster it would have eaten me alive.
that's it. Put him in holding over night.
come on, mate.
what me? No, you don't understand
I've come in to report her.
Hey, wasn't that a Vanderman? - Yeah, Edward.
that might be him... no.
okay, you know what? Edward should have been home by now, don't you think?
Hello, anybody? Will somebody call my mother?
rise and shine.
up, up, up, up, up.
come on, dear. We're moving.
mum?
up, up, up, up, up. - What?
we're moving?
where is Larry Bonsa?
security.
poor Edward. I had no idea.
no, not that.
hallucinations of a hideous pig pig faced girl.
you do know who they're talking about?
Oh, I don't know. Could be any number of women in this city.
I'm next in line for chairman of the board.
do you have any idea what a story like this will do to me?
what my father is going to do to me?
well, that's not really my problem.
okay, I'm not a delusional maniac... am I?
no. So, either you print a retraction or so help me god I am going to rip your guts out.
security.
it'll be twenty five years ago all over again.
reporters popping out of draws. Penelope will be exposed.
and then... what chance do we have?
we could move to the beach. - The beach is good.
or France? - You could practise your French.
I could practice my French.
Merci.
Bonjour. Je suis Penelope.
never mind. I over reacted. Wanda. Wanda!
I demand a retraction. You have ruined my life!
I'm telling you she was a pig. A pig!
I'm telling you she had a piggy snout on her face and I'm not mad.
why will no one believe me?
wait, wait, hold, hold on there, Victor.
I believe that man is with me.
huh? I am?
okay, well first there's Hubert Strauss. - Good. Who else?
Beaux... - Great.
Jack... - Fine.
... the Ripper? - Super, who else?
you know what? Why don't I just say, 'Here's twelve men. Trust me'.
terrific. Let's talk about the dowry. I think we should double it.
if they can't stand me now what makes you think they'll be able to for double?
Oh, now, now with that attitude... - Oh yeah, it's my attitude, mother.
this guy's got a lot of potential.
I know he's going to look at her.
what do you think of this guy? Do you like him?
Oh, sweetheart.
I know, I know. It's not my face.
it's my great, great, great grandfathers face and he's not me, and I'm not him and I'm not me.
and don't you forget it.
I gave my right eye for that story.
and I got back squat.
and that hideous woman still gives me nightmares.
I thought you never saw her?
hmm. No, not Penelope. Her mother. I only caught a glimpse of the baby.
I thought my head was playing tricks on me.
well, thank God someone believes me anyway.
unfortunately, my believing you isn't going to do either one of us any good.
we're going to need some proof to clear both our names.
you think you can get back in there?
Oh, I don't... I don't know.
I mean, if...
no.
are you sure? I just need one photo. - I'm not going back in there.
alright. Okay.
we're just going to have find somebody who can.
hook them up with the agency that sent you.
no, they only see old money, blue blood types, it's part of the whole curse thing.
we're not going to find any blue bloods to help us, they don't need the money.
no, but down and out blue bloods do.
check.
bet.
read them and weep, losers.
Ah. Crap!
you got a Maxwell Campion playing here tonight?
that's him there. Poker table number five.
Hey, pal, wait up.
do I know you?
no, but I know you. Did a little research.
and it seems in a few short years you've managed to gamble away the fortune your family spent generations building.
Hey, hear me out. I'll make it worth your while.
you got the wrong guy.
five thousand bucks worth your while?
we'll need your signature on the last page.
just your standard gag. You don't talk, we don't talk.
just how ugly is this girl?
I believe the young lady is waiting.
wow, this guy is wasting my time.
Oh, he's here.
Hey, man, look, I'm sorry that I'm late. - Alright, yeah. Take off the jacket.
alright.
Hey.
alright, now... hey you with me?
alright, the camera is in the lapel. The rigging is in the sleeve. Put it on.
come on, it looks great on you.
now to take a picture you just raise either arm.
not now.
alright. Look, I'm sorry, man.
Yeah, I know you are. Did you have to gamble all night?
Yeah, I still had chips. I'm good?
Yeah. Let's... come on, let's go.
don't worry, I'll get that.
and you are?
I'm Max Campion and the agency sent me.
Oh, right. Campion. - There you go ...shit.
excuse me?
God Damn!
alright, dear, we've done as you asked. They're all in the annexe.
all of them? All of them.
but why you wouldn't rather talk to them one at a time is beyond me.
I told you mother this way it will be easier to weed out the unlikelys.
Hello, I'm Penelope. And you must be?
late for tea?
they're out, they're, they're running... They've all seen her.
Where's Max?
Edward, do you see Max?
I don't see Max. He's not there. There's no Max.
how could you? - Just speeding things up.
Oh, and now you're just going to make a pig of yourself?
no, that's already been done for me. - Stop it.
that was the last of the ho-hos.
Where's your credit card? I'm going to the store.
no, no, no don't you... hey!
if you want more ho-ho's I'll send Jake for some.
I'm old enough to get my own.
pick me up some cigarettes.
Penelope, just one man, one man.
and he'll run too. They always run why can't you accept that?
for seven years I've been watching them run.
do you have any idea how that makes me feel? Do you?
I'm sorry, but we just can't quit.
yes we can because...
no matter how much I want to believe there's one man who won't run away one man who...
sweet loving angel of all things merciful.
did he see?
he must have. He was there.
who is he? - Who cares? Just go!
Yes, go. - No, I can't...
go! - Go!
damn it.
you're still here?
did you see? See?
you didn't see? I didn't?
did you? Did I what?
don't mess with me. What? I'm messing with you?
why are you still here? Still?
fine then, why are you here?
look I'm sorry. Should I go?
are you a fan of George Rockham?
who?
the book you've got in your jacket.
Oh, alright. You caught that, huh?
well... yeah. Yeah, it's a great book.
so you've read it?
well, yeah.
funny I thought that was the only surviving copy.
you know what? I meant to read it, but the library was always out
I saw it was a first edition and I figured it might be worth something.
so you were stealing it?
well... Yeah. I was stealing it.
so, you're a fan of the money?
I'm a big fan of the money. Although, it doesn't much care for me.
well, maybe you and the money weren't meant to be.
Hey, I wouldn't go that far. Jinx me.
there are 326 first editions in that room.
of those, 300 are worth over 50, 000.
a dozen or so are worth over 25, 000.
and I'm afraid there's only one that's valued under a hundred.
only one, huh?
a little novel, written by a little nobody, that never amounted to anything.
you don't say. Under a hundred?
I'm afraid so. And... I'm afraid that it's time for...
but it's your favourite just the same? - What?
I said, 'your favourite just the same'.
I heard you.
top shelf, third from the left, 'Moby Dick'. It's a first edition.
but wait till I'm gone or they'll see you.
see me?
what?
Hello?
Hello?
got ya!
no?
will you be back tomorrow?
I knew it. I knew you were there.
Yeah.
he'll be back. - He will.
so? - I didn't get it.
how could you not get it, half the men in this city...
relax. I'm coming back tomorrow.
Ow! Door.
you better.
see you tomorrow.
better.
sweetheart? What's wrong?
I thought he just knew, but it says it right here.
still he chose it.
of the 2, 000 that aren't your favourite, he chose the one that is.
alright. Alright.
do you play?
I wish you'd stop doing that.
do you play? - The frog?
no, no although I always meant to pick it up.
but you do play something.
what makes you say that? - What do you play?
guess.
is this really necessary?
she's finding his instrument.
isn't that something a man should do for himself?
you are my sunshine, my only sunshine
you make me happy when skies are grey.
you'll never know, dear dear how much I love you.
are you even playing that?
so please don't take my sunshine away.
okay, it's not the bass. - No? No?
try the drums. - Alright.
the drums, you play drums.
okay.
so please don't take... my sunshine away.
okay, okay, no, no, no. No more drums.
no? Not the drums, it's not the drums...
alright!
saxophone, saxophone!
you want sax?
enough, stop. Stop, stop!
enough. - No? No, alright.
play the guitar. The guitar.
guitar. It's got to be the guitar.
I don't think that's how you play the guitar.
okay, stop, stop. Stop! Please stop, stop.
Oh, my. That was, that was terrible.
hey everybody, everybody wave.
everybody wave to Penelope and take a bow, alright? And bow.
I know, I know you guys you were fantastic though come here. Thank you so much for everything.
wait, wait I'm not done guessing.
come on, enough about me. What do you play?
you want to be a hortomaculturalwhat?
a horticulturalist. You know? Someone who works with plants.
right.
why is that funny?
no plants are great. I just thought of you as like... like a cop.
you know seeing as you've got the whole interrogation thing down.
shut up, it's your move.
alright.
Oh, you really don't want to do that. - Why not?
because I'll kill her. - What if I asked you not to?
I'd still kill her. You'd sort of be begging me to.
so, beer. You've never had a beer?
I've had a beer.
on tap? - No, not on tap.
well, then you've never had a beer.
your knight can't do that. - My knight?
the horse. - Alright.
Hey, how about you and me heading down to the Cloverdilly pub right now?
pub Cloverdilly?
best beer, best blues, some of the best beer bums in town.
Thanks, maybe later.
Penelope, come on.
come on, you've got to get out of there sometime.
right?
what are you waiting for?
you know, truth is, you're... you're not missing much.
Really? The Cloverdilly pub sounds fun.
Yeah, but... aside from that.
and the street fairs? I hear they sell really cool stuff right on the street.
you know, the vendors themselves are pretty cool too.
Oh, and the park? - The park is great.
I used to spend every weekend there just hanging on a bench writing stupid love songs...
people watching. - Used to? You don't do that anymore?
what are you doing instead?
well, beating you at chess. - I warned you I'd kill her.
that's great because as soon as my guys here have seen what you've done...
the game will be over, your queen will be dead.
my king's still pretty active, you know?
once the queen's dead the kings useless.
what's that about? - I don't know?
maybe he's too depressed to fight. He really loved her you know?
Yeah, I can see that.
my queen to yours, checkmate.
you got me.
man, what is this guy doing?
wasting all my film.
he's doing it on purpose. He's going for the dowry.
I wish I could find a girl with a dowry.
give me a break.
why else would it be taking you so long? She revealed herself to me straight away.
you know what? I guess she liked you more.
why settle for five thousand when you could get ten times that, right?
well, maybe you're forgetting... I've seen her. She is grotesque.
shut him up.
I'm talking un-kissable ugly. Nightmare ugly.
listen you little worm. I know your kind spoiled rotten mama's boy...
God! He licked me.
Edward. - What?
don't lick Max.
sorry.
listen you can't blame us for being a little suspicious.
fine, find someone else. - Fine, give us back the money.
it's starting. It's starting! Would you come on!
okay, I've got it. Piano.
you play the piano. I bet my life on it.
alright, keep in mind; 'never bet a better'.
does he have another jacket?
you are my sunshine...
my only sunshine...
you make me happy No, it's B flat.
b flat on the right hand.
no, right hand!
you see, the left hand stays, and the right hand plays the chord.
you see? - Yeah, yeah. It's better.
shit! - I'm a monster.
no, no your not, Penelope!
stay with Max.
darling, do not... Please, do not...
I told you! I told you!
no, you ran. It was you this time.
he said 'shit' - Big shit.
he said 'shit' to me twice.
and then he just stood there staring at me.
no one's ever just stood there before.
if you give the poor boy a chance to adjust. I mean, put yourself in...
what are you doing? I told you to stay with him.
you did? I didn't hear you.
when you said, 'stay with Max'...
I meant stay with Max.
you never said, 'Wanda, stay with him'.
I told you! - I'm sorry I didn't hear you.
mom?
don't worry, dear. He couldn't have gone far - Did you get it? - Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Hey, I needed that photo.
she's not what Edward said she was. You just leave her alone.
who is that? - Lock the gate!
no, don't, don't shut the gate!
I got him, I got him.
Penelope, there's something I have to tell you.
no, he's a spy. - No... yes.
Yes, he's a spy. He's working for Lemon,
the reporter who forced me to bury you.
you said I was cremated. - That too.
I hope you were well paid, because you just said goodbye to a fortune.
wait! He's still one of your own kind.
he could still break the curse.
Max. I know this face repulses you...
and I... and I wouldn't dream of asking you to accept it.
but this isn't me.
the real me is inside here somewhere just waiting to get out.
and you can make that happen.
once the curse is broken I'll be just like anybody else.
what if you're not? What if the curse isn't broken.
what if... what if the curse can never be broken?
then I'll kill myself. I promise. I promise I will.
marry me, Max.
marry me.
I can't.
get out!
I'm... - Get out!
get out! - Out!
right out!
okay, this is what we're going to do...
I felt the rush of a thousand heart breaks.
this is nothing we haven't been through before.
Penelope, we can do it again.
I will never give up, sweetheart.
never, Penelope!
and I knew with all my heart she meant it.
we have both always known there was no guarantee.
we have not both always known that there was no guarantee.
we have spent so much time preparing her for the day things would be different, we've never prepared her for the day that they're not.
maybe we should stop all this match making and...
give her a puppy. Hmm?
sweetheart? Penelope is that you?
Yes, mother. I'm just going to make some cocoa.
a puppy.
okay. - What can I say?
I'm sorry you got stuck with me. I'm sorry I dragged you down with me.
I know I'm the bad blood. I am the Wilhern. I know that.
the curse is on me. I am the curse.
me, . it's me, it's me I, me, me, me.
honey. Honey! I think your father could use some cocoa too.
okay mother.
actually I might have a cup too.
she's escaped.
let's go. - God, she's going to be coming after me.
Edward, you've got to control yourself. - Quick!
what are you doing? - We need help.
Yes, I'd like to report my daughter missing.
are you out of your mind? What if they find her?
for crying out loud Jessica!
okay, you know what? I can't hold it any longer. Come with me.
I have to pee and I can't leave you alone with the phones.
you know dear, there was a time...
when I might have jumped at such an invitation, but right now I can't.
hello - Mum?
hold the line, please. - Mum?
collect call from Penelope... - Yes, we'll accept - Mum? Go ahead with your call, please.
hello...
Penelope, what the hell were you thinking?
did anyone see you yet? No... Mum, no
good, good. Where are you? We'll come and get you.
I'm just calling to say that I love you, and... goodbye.
Penelope don't...
at least we know she's alright.
don't you have to pee or something? - No, dear, that was you.
I can check you in over here.
hi...
can I have a room, please?
shouldn't be a problem. Room 8 is available.
thank you. - You don't want the room?
no, I, I want the room.
then would you mind coming back here so I can check you in?
thank you. And how will you be paying for your room?
thank you, Jessica
okay, that's it for me, folks. New dealer coming in.
erm, nostrils are bigger. More... more piggy.
Hey, hey. Guys, guys, come on. We've got to wrap this up.
I've got a deadline here. We've got to go to print.
crosser, crosser... - Freakin' Mona Lisa come on...
your morning paper, madam. - Oh, thanks, Jake.
holy magda! Aaaah!
damn it, Edward! - Dad, they all think I'm crazy.
and this helps you? How?
you told me... I thought this would prove...
try to remember I'm your son.
that's exactly what I'm trying to forget.
thank you, ma'am. Gentlemen.
so, how's everybody doing this fine day?
I thought you went home.
I did. Slept for eight blissful hours, fixed the kids breakfast, kissed the wife goodbye, and, according to the button, it's your blind.
you want to take your blind?
are you in or out?
Hey, he's still got chips. He's in.
just give him some time. He's in. He'll come around.
Yeah, I'll take another. Make it a large one.
Hey, he's still got chips. He's in
for starters, I'm going to need a recent photograph.
no photographs. - None whatsoever?
no. The er... fire got them.
OK, a detailed description.
brown hair.
brown eyes.
a unique... ly pleasant personality.
think pig.
so she's a fat girl? - Not exactly.
Jessica! Not in front of company.
don't be silly. He knows I didn't mean it.
that's not true, madam.
I may not have said anything, but I was filing it away.
so she's not exactly fat?
does any of this really matter? Just go find her!
our daughter's out there somewhere, lost and afraid
you haven't given me anything to go on.
no photographs, no friends, no job, no hangouts...
it's something like this, but minus the fangs.
Franklin! - Do you want to find her or not?
minus the fangs.
they're certainly eye-grabbing.
Jake, purse.
OK, you know what? Never mind. How much do we owe you?
Where's my...?
who took my wallet?
it's our daughter. Please help us. Please, I'm begging you.
what he's trying to say is, give us the key now!
I'm sorry, but...
the room is registered in my name with my...
who's the guest? Me. That makes me the guest.
you two go on ahead. Not real big on the fang thing.
well, at least we know she's not starving.
no, not... not just... not just any pig.
you need to stop talking now.
Hello?
Yeah, that's right...
Penelope? - Who is this?
that was Penelope on the...
sell her own picture?
er... then why did you hang up?
Edward, what's... what's wrong with you? Did you ever...?
how did you know it was me?
just a lucky guess. You have something you want to sell us?
that's right.
may I ask why you are doing this?
what do you care? You're getting a freak.
Hey, nobody said anything about a freak.
listen, do you want it or not? - Sure. Yes.
Yes. Yes, I do. Thank you.
look, Grandma, a pig! - How nice.
fangs?
there are no fangs.
well, she must just suck them back Edward, you know, I've been thinking.
I know and you know. Maybe that's enough.
lemon, half the people in this city think I'm crazy.
I've got to prove to them that I'm not.
I'm sorry. I've got to do it.
ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the pig-faced girl.
you see? I'm not crazy.
am I crazy? You, am I crazy? I'm not crazy.
you weren't kidding!
can I get you something?
can I have a beer on tap, please?
sure. You can have this one.
coming right up.
you're supposed to catch it. - Oh, sorry.
are you ready now?
there you go. - Thank you.
is there a problem?
do you have any straws? - Sure.
there you go.
that's half of what you gave me.
you'll get the rest back when I'm ready.
let's just call it even. - No, let's not.
she's not some freaking pay day.
she sold me the photo herself.
Yeah. Apparently, she's... out there on her own, declaring her independence.
hey there, Jack. - Annie!
lucky you, last delivery of the day.
how are you doing?
are you sure you really want to know, or are you just asking?
I'm just asking. - So I'm driving my Vespa, and this guy comes out of nowhere and hits me. I go flying.
I'm in the street and he's stands over me and he's, like, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't see.
how can he not see me, you know? I'm on a Vespa with wings.
I mean, right, you can see me. You can see me, right?
what?
see? She can see me.
you ought to sic Billy on him.
Yeah, it's a little too late. You've got to sign here.
Billy moved back to the burbs. - Yeah? Sorry to hear it.
Yeah. We had no business being together. He was a picket fence kind of guy.
and, like, what guy looks at me and thinks picket fence.
unless he's crazy, and I'm done dating crazy, you know? Done.
unless it's meant to be. Right?
Yeah. Right.
right? - Right.
I can't hear you with that thing on your face.
the usual. On the house.
Thanks, Jack. You're the best.
Cheers.
so, what? Are you hiding from the law, or is that a bad nose job?
Mm-hm. Bad nose job.
do you mind me asking how much that might cost somebody, like a nose job?
Oh, nothing. - Free?
I was just thinking maybe... getting a little work done myself.
a nose job?
Yeah, kind of, but for like for my ears, you know?
they just, stick out up here a little on the top. I mean, I'm no Penelope, but...
no, you have beautiful ears. Beautiful. They're beautiful.
what, are you drunk? - I'm drunk.
Hey, Jack, how about another round for my pal, Scarfy, here?
coming up.
what's a Vespa?
what's a V...? You've never ridden on a Vespa?
Hey, Sam, long time no see. - Wow, look who's back.
look... have you seen the guys around?
they're touring, opening for some band who's supposed to be good.
no kidding? That's...that's great. - What brings you back here?
Oh, you know... Iooking around.
actually, I thought it was maybe time I started playing again.
yeah? Well, good luck with that, eh?
look, come on, Sam, I wouldn't even ask if...
you are joking, ain't you? After all your no-shows?
I only look stupid.
look, I messed up. Know, and I'm sorry.
let's just say I didn't appreciate a good thing when I had it.
Oh, and now you do? - Now I do.
still got your scarf on.
all right, hop on.
all right, I gotta go down the street.
Oi! Mozart!
Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry. It won't happen again.
don't muck about.
you can take your whole face off. My brother once was like, he was just riding his bicycle, and he hit this, like, parked car, and he was so freaked out about seeing his teeth in the hood, and, like, his whole face was bleeding then he got back on the bicycle and he went to the movies...
look! Helleborus orientalis.
they're amazing. They bloom even in the winter.
Oh, that's cool.
they just pop up without any help from anyone.
that's like my ex-boyfriend, if you know what I mean.
you know what I mean, right?
Really?
you don't get out much, do you?
we should talk.
another postcard. - I don't care.
what's it say? Went ice skating.
stop. I don't care.
circus. - It's been months.
zoo.
how could she be doing all these things without being seen?
she can't! That's how.
Oh, honey, what are we going to do?
that's her scarf! Look.
no, she went that...
this is really good.
Oh, great. You're here. It's your turn to buy.
all right, I lied. I'll buy.
Oh, my God!
somebody pull this scarf off her. She can't breathe.
they're not running.
Ah! No! Penelope, no! No, no, no, dear! Turn away!
she's coming out!
there she is!
Penelope, this way! This way, Penelope!
is it true you were chained up in the basement?
don't encourage them.
Penelope, do you have any other pig parts?
with such a large nose, do you smell better than the rest of us?
I don't know. You tell me.
mom, can I borrow some money? I'm running low.
absolutely not. You get in that car.
mom, they want to know if you chained me up in the basement.
like, after three weeks, I was like, I knew something was up.
nose jobs only take so long, you know.
no, of course not.
Bye, darling. - Bye.
let it go, dear.
Penelope, is there anything you'd like to say to the public?
er... hi.
mr Vanderman!
is it true you attempted to file assault charges against Penelope?
I've obtained the police report.
no comment, please. Ladies and gentlemen.
it's OK. I can handle it.
that woman, that thing, belongs in a cage.
what a creep. - Excuse me.
have you lost your mind?
you saw her. She's a complete monster.
the public loves this girl.
they don't know her like I do. - We're a publicly traded company.
we love what the public loves. Get it?
so, what are you saying?
I'm saying you've got to fix this.
I don't know what you expect me to do.
just fix it!
come on, Penelope, you're on my team!
OK, but I'm not very good.
come on, come on, come on.
I told you I wasn't very good.
Hi. - Hi.
you really did it, huh?
I mean, er... you look great, you know, really happy.
Thanks.
Yeah. You know, you inspired me.
doing what you did, going off on your own like that.
I er... l'm not... - I have to go.
Yeah, sure. I just...
Oh, darling, I am so glad I found you!
you must come home right now!
I have the most wonderful surprise.
OK, Mom, but I really should get back.
Penelope. What is this?
listen, I'm sorry I ran from my feelings.
Oh, is that what you were running from?
I was certain you were running from me.
only my feelings for you.
is this a joke? - Penelope, don't make the boy beg.
look at that face. He can break the curse.
but things are different now, Mother. I...
she's overwhelmed.
Why? Because you're splattered all over the newspapers?
no, because I have friends.
those aren't friends, dear. Those are fans.
"did you hear? The pig speaks ten languages."
"Oh, look, the pig can play the piano."
you're just a talking pig to those people. A talking pig.
edward wants to marry you.
are you prepared to walk away from your one and only chance?
our one and only chance at a normal life?
will you marry me, Penelope?
Hey, Lemon.
I thought you might be able to help me with this Max Campion story I'm doing.
well, what's the story?
I'm doing this kind of riches to rags to armed robbery story.
armed robbery? Come on? Max Campion?
Yeah. I just got the call. He's already confessed.
what?
pick it up.
you the lawyer my mother sent?
there's been a mistake. I'm here to see Max Campion.
Yeah, hey, I'm Max Campion.
no, you're not. - Yes, I am.
no, Max Campion.
I am not deaf. I can hear you. I am Max Campion.
but you're...
what about the guy you play poker with?
shaggy hair, er... medium build.
doesn't know when to quit.
Ah! Er... is Johnny Martin. - Johnny Martin?
Johnny Martin. Poor loser.
get that down, Martin, in the pirate pad there
do you have...? Hey, don't!
Oh, that was so wonderful. Was it not wonderful?
Yes, wonderful.
we have to do this again.
now that we're nearly family,
I think this is just the beginning.
Yes. I'll fetch the limo. - Good, good, good.
can I have my coat, please?
Oh, Franklin, we used to go out to the theatre all the time. Why did we stop?
I guess because we had an ugly daughter.
it's true, Jessica. We gave up everything because we had an ugly daughter.
let me help you with that, sir. - Thank you.
it's just over there. - OK, we're going.
but my coat! - Fine, we'll get you another one.
Edward, what are you doing? Where are we going?
Max. - Hello, Penelope.
we were just leaving.
Hey, how are things, Edward? - Keep walking.
I understand it got a bit grotesque there for a while, even puke ugly.
but... You two know each other? - As a matter of fact, we do.
Yale, wasn't it?
no, I believe it was a Bedford, a Bedford van to be...
stop! Haven't you hurt her enough?
bathroom. Now. - Edward, I...
why don't you let Edward handle this? - But, Mother...
you make me sick!
Why? I'm giving her exactly what she wants.
and I don't see anybody else lining up to do that.
Oh, unless... unless you are. Are you lining up?
that's not the point. - Yeah, it is. Yes, it is the point!
look, if you want to go out there and tell her that the only man willing to stand up and say, 'I do,'
still gags at the thought of kissing her, then be my guest, but it's not me you'll be hurting.
it's her, isn't it?
son of a plumber, huh? - It sure took you long enough.
boy, you sure fooled me.
so, it looks like you were doing her a favour after all.
you seen this? - Hmm. Cute couple.
Yeah. Penelope and the beast.
Hey, they're both getting what they want, right?
I know what he's getting. What's she getting?
well, she's getting the day she's waited for all her life, breaking the curse.
Oh, you don't actually believe that, do you?
well, don't you?
what the hell have you been chasing all these years?
I don't know. A wounded ego and a missing eye, I guess.
come on, a curse?
Yeah. Who knows? You know, you spend enough time around a poker table, you believe in all sorts of things.
Hey, it's not too late to stop Edward.
that's what she wants.
wait. If getting married is all it takes to break the 'ooh, the curse,'...
why not you?
you're forgetting, man. I'm not Max. - So?
"one of their own kind'.
Hey! Over here! I saved you a seat! It's clean.
Hey, Annie, look at you.
weddings are great, aren't they?
Yeah. When they're somebody else's.
Jessica, I need a word.
what's the matter? Is there a problem?
and Edward seems really nice.
mom, I think I'm going to throw up.
just remember, in a few minutes from now, the curse will be broken.
there is no curse. The only one cursed here is me.
for starters... - Losing your eye was your own damn fault.
now what? - I just wanted to apologise.
apology not accepted.
What?! I have a wedding to go to!
meet Johnny Martin.
I told you not to rush the process.
this doesn't change a thing.
how can you say that? Not only was Edward part of...
as you yourself once said, he's still one of our own kind.
OK, fine. What about Max, or Johnny or whatever his name is?
what about him?
don't you think Penelope's entitled to know?
that he lied about everything?
that he doesn't have the power to break the curse.
why on earth would she need to know that?
don't you see? Maybe that's the only reason he said no.
I don't know that. You don't know that. But if that's true,
God bless him, he did the right thing.
damn it, Jessica, I can't just... - Leave it alone.
not that I'm not happy for her. I'm really happy for her.
you're happy for her, right?
lf she's happy, I'm happy. - Right.
mom, I feel stupid. - Oh, you don't look stupid.
you look...
you don't look stupid.
do you, Edward Vanderman take Penelope Wilher to be your lawfully wedded wife?
to have and to hold, for better or for worse for richer or for poorer in sickness and in health.
to love and to cherish from this day forward until death do you part?
I do.
and do you, Penelope Wilhern, take Edward Humphrey Vanderman III to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, for better or for worse for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish from this day forward until death do you part?
nobody move! She's fine!
Penelope, wait! Penelope! Stop!
look at me.
I am. What is it, dear?
no, look at me.
I am! What? I don't understand! What do you mean?
you... I'm sorry.
Penelope, it's not too late.
go away, Mother!
honey, just think about what you're doing.
this is the moment we have worked so hard for.
I said go away!
sweetheart, please! Please!
we are one yes away from a whole new life.
a whole new you!
but I don't want a whole new me, Mother!
sweetheart, please! Please!
I like myself the way I am.
it's not going to grow back.
what makes you think I... - I miss it too.
and then I remembe you're still you.
Oh, Penelope...
"one of your own kind." I just assumed...
no, we all did, Mother.
no, dear. No. Don't you see?
I could have broken the curse years ago if I'd just done my job as your mother, and loved you as my own.
you didn't know. You didn't know.
Oh, look.
you know, darling, with the carotid artery out of the way,
I think a little turn up might, right there, be sweet. Look at that.
what? You're crazy.
Oh, it's wrong for a young woman to want to look her best?
that's not a bad thing...
what? I'm being her mother.
that's what mothers do with daughters!
they talk about how to look prettier.
still, I felt sad for my mother that day...
why are you turning it around? Oh, now I'm the bad guy!
... having to cope with so many changes all at once.
it all went back to shit!
I was packing to go, and after 25 years with the family...
Jake, where are you going? Jake, I'm talking to you. Jake?
and why do you have that bag? Jake! Don't be rude!
you turn around when I'm talking to you, please.
I happen to be...
there, there, now. There, there.
but I had my own changes to cope with, and, while I missed the face that had caused so much trouble...
... the world had moved on.
... and I was determined to find my own way, and determined to always follow my heart...
look! My daffodil bloomed!
and I found Helleborus orientalis!
... and my conscience.
dear Edward, that first day in the library, you said that you too have felt imprisoned most of your life.
looking back, I now believe you were speaking from your heart.
I fear I did you a terrible disservice that day
I knew you would run I wanted you to, but perhaps if I had taken the time to really listen to you, maybe we could have helped each other find our way.
I'm sorry. I hope this lette and this ring finds you well.
Edward? Edward? Your father wants to know what you're doing in there.
and then came Halloween.
okay, everybody. We're going to start in about ten minutes, so I need you all to go and get your costumes on. OK?
just get changed and line up by the front door as quick as possible.
Hey! Hey! No fighting.
I can be whoever I want! - Girls, please.
but she knew I was going to be Penelope.
all right, girls, you're going to have to go out with the rest of the class.
go and line up. Come on, line up. Get ready to go. Come on.
Alice? Honey, what's wrong?
everybody's Penelope, and I'm a stupid static cling!
Oh... Well, frankly, I find you quite refreshing.
come on, sweetie. Stick with me and we'll both make it through this.
trick or treat!
well, hello there.
I love this one. These are my favourites. - Jess, you're going to want to see this.
is this too much?
Bye.
and then Wanda couldn't hold on to the secret any longer.
you're everywhere. Are you freaking out or what?
OK, 357. - There it is.
hold on.
what?
it's just kind of great to see the old you.
OK. All right, let's go. - All right, here we go.
you can do this. Are you ready?
Hi. Um... l...
she's gotta pee. You got a bathroom? I'm going to get some punch.
er... yeah. Yeah, sure. I guess it's OK. Come on in.
it looks like a good party.
why aren't you at the party?
I gotta pack.
so, are you moving?
er... out-of-town job. I felt like getting out of the city for a while.
away from the crowds?
Yeah, the crowds at the poker tables.
Oh, so you're a gambler?
ex. Avoiding temptation.
well, that's good.
good for you. I er...
I had a friend once who um... liked to gamble.
at least, well, I heard he liked to gamble, - And, he had to stay away from... - Take off the mask.
what?
I'm sorry.
all Halloween, I've been running into...
well, someone I used to know. Sorry. Ridiculous.
this someone, she meant a lot to you?
Yes.
Yes, she did.
what happened?
I couldn't give her what she wanted.
what did she want?
to be free.
you shit!
you lied to me! I guessed piano, and you said...
Penelope, I'm sorry. - I know.
no. I don't have the power to break the curse.
it's OK. It turns out that I did.
it's me, Max.
my name's Johnny.
I know. Johnny. I'm still me.
so, there we were.
and we lived happily ever after.
well, happily ever after so far at least.
I don't get it. What does it mean?
well, what do you think it means? - Rich people suck!
it's always the mother's fault.
we're all cursed?
it's not the power of the curse, it's the power you give the curse.
what did you say, Shrimp? - He's not a shrimp, dummy.
he is too a shrimp! - Hey! That's not nice!
that's very good, Billy.
OK, they're serving snacks down at the picnic tables.
then, after break, we'll go explore, and see what you can collect.
stay together.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system...
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I know, because I built it.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you,
crimes the government considered irrelevant.
they wouldn't act, so I decided I would.
but I needed a partner... someone with the skills to intervene.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if you're number's up, we'll find you.
we have a new number, Mr. Reese.
his name is Michael Cahill.
that all you got, Finch?
Cahill's 33 years old, single, no wife, no children, no pets.
no attachments of any kind.
a bit like you, Mr. Reese.
problem with this guy's passport at Kennedy.
I. N.S. Is on the way. We're supposed to wait.
this guy just flew 15 hours for a heart transplant.
I'm not letting him code out here 16 blocks from the hospital.
Finch: for all intents and purposes, Cahill appears to be an upstanding citizen.
reese: appearances can be deceptive.
we're paying you good money, so keep your mouth shut, okay?
Finch: indeed. Cahill's a criminal.
B&E, assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon.
now he's graduated to smuggling.
crew's run by a guy named Vargas.
these guys will move anything.
and if someone gets in their way, they'll kill everyone.
how do you suggest we proceed, Mr. Reese?
as usual, Finch. The more dangerous they are...
what are you waiting for? Go.
the closer I want to be to them.
we got a problem.
let me talk to the cop.
I got this.
stay put.
relax, kid.
Cahill will talk us out of this.
and if he can't, he'll just kill him.
I never met a guy who hated cops as much as this guy.
Yeah, so what's taking him so long, huh?
he calls backup and we're all dead.
he doesn't have backup.
I'm all paid up with hr.
you found this rig?
tail light's out.
our friend was just letting us know as a courtesy.
here's your cut.
thought I was gonna have to waste them.
Mike, Mike. Hold up, brother.
kid's do enough learning for toght, Mike.
one mo mista, I kill him.
got a problem, Finch. Cahill's on the move.
it's nearly 3: 00 in the morning.
any idea where he's going? - No.
but whatever he's up to can't be good.
Finch, Cahill's casing a home.
3404 Orchard avenue in Brooklyn.
he's breaking in, Finch.
I need some information. Now.
homeowner's last name is Tulley.
he's a police officer. John, you've got to stop Cahill.
daddy! Daddy! You're home. - Hey, boy.
time for all good boys to go to sleep.
later, champ. Sleep tight.
Mr. Reese, it appears that you're not the only person working undercover.
2008 loccation: undisclosed - They might be updating our orders.
you think this is being run through Langley?
we're not even supposed to operate in this godforsaken country.
how many times are you gonna clean that thing?
in the army, they taught us the fastest way to get shot was to fail to clean your weapon.
in the marines, they taught us the fastest way to clean your weapon was to shoot a couple people with it.
best I could do.
cheap Polish Vodka.
package secure?
we have everything we need...
except the orders of where to deliver it.
almost everything. You're missing a glass.
found it.
the package. What'd he do?
not our concern. - Guy looks government.
the natives don't like us taking their people.
he's government.
tried to sell something of ours to the chinese.
what? - Software.
something.
I don't know, don't care.
we've got one job in this
render him to some black hole from which he will never return.
if the papers don't clear or the plane runs out of fuel, you execute him.
when was the last time you were in country, my friend?
call's not coming in tonight.
go get yourself some r&r.
don't forget you're behind enemy lines.
you get caught here you're on your own.
Cahill certainly had me fooled.
Cahill's real name is Daniel Tulley.
graduated from the police academy in 2003.
since then, all work records have disappeared.
the NYPD seems to have gone to great lengths to hide his identity,
including a false social security number.
but if the machine gave us his nuer, it may mean ebody's figured out he's a cop.
we should warn him.
it - Risking his life is what he signed up for. P.
we've got company, Finch.
why don't you just wear it if you're gonna go announcing yourself?
less than a day away from the biggest collar of your career, you decide to take a holiday?
the man's Cahill's handler.
no one followed me. I just needed to feel normal.
we got enough on Vargas. I could pull you out now.
we could have gotten vargas five months ago. He's just a smuggler.
l. O.S.-- That's the guy we want.
word is he'sicking up the next shipment in person.
l. O.S. is a fairy tale, Michael.
this from the last delivery from L. O.S.
it's 100% pure.
we found the big one.
the direct source.
whoever this l. O.S. Is...
if no one's stepping on his shipments, there's a good reason.
I don't want to wind up in a dark suit, having to inform your wife
I'll take care of my end, you take care of yours.
I think Vargas has a cop in his pocket.
last night was too confident that black and white wouldn't have backup.
he's got someone protecting him from the inside, I'm sure of it.
I'll look into it.
Cahill believes vargas has a cop on his payroll.
so do I.
Vargas was talking about being paid up with hr
the same corrupt cops who were willing to let Elias kill Carter.
detective Carter!
agent snow.
didn't realize you were still in town.
I took a trip upstate.
I'm sure now that our boy's working with a police officer.
what makes you say that?
found his fingerprints at a veterinary clinic in the Catskills.
and yet I am certain that John was never there.
I hope his new friend is luckier.
John has a tendency to use people and then, well, discard them.
I remember his old partner's funeral like it was yesterday.
a pretty woman.
like you.
after he was done with her, not so much.
a word, detective.
you do realize the man that shot John was just here?
agent Snow doesn't know about me...
or my arrangement with our mutual friend.
we need your help, detective.
this man is Michael Cahill, otherwise known as Danie Tulley
narcotics detective working undercover with a smuggling ring.
one that Mr. Reese has just infiltrated.
of course he has.
but we believe that there's a leak at the NYPD.
I don't need to tell you what can happen if Cahill's cover is blown.
you expect me to find this leak.
I just need you to explain the system.
who would know about Cahill's being undercover?
only is handler.
what about the people that have access to his paperwork, files?
files on undercovers are kept only as hard copies, so peopllike you can't hack into them.
words wound, detective.
the files are kept in safes in one room controlled by IAB.
have the combinations onto their uc's safe.
anyone tries to break in, IAB will send them on a one-Way trip to Rikers.
so we would need to destroy Cahill's file before anyone could retrieve it.
we? Yeah, see, breaki into 1pp is a federal offense.
I've got it covered.
let me guess, you need another favor.
someone might be selling out an undercover narc to a smuggler named Vargas.
pay some of your dirty buddies in narcotics a visit.
those guys don't exactly trust me anymore.
I've been getting some good collars lately too.
even got a commendation.
your ass got y that commendation.
time to get yourands dirty again.
yeah?
you don't say.
which one?
well, find out then.
now.
something's wrong, Finch.
Vargas got a phone call, and he's not happy about it.
we go ahead with the delivery now.
because l. O.S. Will kill us if we don't.
how many time I invite you for dinner?
all business with you.
business is good. No time to eat.
you know, I've been thinking.
you and I might want to renegotiate our deal.
you know, in our busines thinking...
is the most dangerous thing you can start doing.
or maybe I take the shipment directly to l. O.S?
cut you out.
fine, fine.
tell you what.
how about I give you a little something extra, okay?
just for you?
yeah?
come on, come on!
out! Let's go! Move it!
get him in the back.
that's it. Hit it.
fools, hurry up.
Yeah. - All right.
come on.
lay down there.
thought we were meeting with l. O.S.boss.
we are.
just making a little pit stop first.
take your phones out and destroy them.
drop looks to be in Brooklyn.
should have the exact location in a second.
what happened?
your weapons... toss 'em in.
all of you. Now.
one of you is a cop.
in an hour or two, I'm going to find out which one.
whoever's still alive will finish making this delivery.
do you mind? - No, not at all.
the power of our democracy.
hell of a thing, huh?
tonight is your answer.
you, uh, live in New York, or you just visiting?
just visiting.
where you from?
originally?
Puyallup, Washington.
are you kidding me? My wife's from Puyallup.
you still live there?
not for a long time.
I travel for work.
Ah. I used to do that.
it's brutal.
not anymore.
me and the wife just put a down payment on our first house...
up in New Rochelle.
you don't say. Sounds nice.
Hey, you know what? My wife's running late, as usual.
I better give her a call.
make sure she's okay.
what did I tell you, John?
you told me to get a drink.
and of the 8 million people you could be drinking with in New York city,
you just happened to pick the one who's married to your ex?
gotta help me. Please, please.
he's losing too much blood. We should take him to the hospital.
no one's going anywhere until I know which one of you is a rat.
sip it.
slowly, slowly.
take me to the hospital, Mike, please!
shut it or I'll put you out of your misery myself.
help me, please.
we need to build a tourniquet.
why bother? - If we stop the bleeding, it might get him to shut up.
you guys get a call? - Someone lit up Su Chin's.
narco thing gone south. Damn shame.
best Kung Pao in Queens. - Sorry for your loss.
Where's your partner?
Oh, let me guess. Queens?
I'm having a little trouble finding him, actually.
you lost him? - "Lost" would be a strong word.
but, yes, detective, in answer to your unspoken question, I do need your help.
what you got?
a license plate.
he's lost a lot of blood.
think he'll make it? - Probably not.
we did the best we could.
onto docks - All right, we got a break.
we're looking for a warehouse on the docks in Brooklyn.
dispatch, we need multiple units to respond.
look what the cat drug in.
you look terrible.
look at you. You might want to lay off the brown liquor.
to what do I owe the pleasure?
smuggler by the name of Neil Vargas.
you ever heard of him?
want to twist his arm a little bit, see if I can get a percentage of his scores.
thought maybe you might want to get in.
I don't hear a peep from you for three months, then all of a sudden you show up with this new score.
hard to trust a guy whose buddies wind up in prison.
you want to shake down this Vargas?
you gotta be a good boy and ask permission.
if this guy isn't already paid up with HR, you could have at it.
who do I contact if I want to contact HR?
you already have.
I'll be in touch.
I won't hold my breath.
yeah? Finch: there's gonna be a shift change at 1 police plaza.
this may be our only opportunity.
opportunity for what?
are you in position, detective?
whoa, whoa, easy with the volume there.
no wonder Mr. Sunshine's always in a foul mood.
you'll get used to it. It takes a little time,
which you're running out of. - Okay, okay.
what's the plan, kimosabe?
the plan is simple.
the IAB detective that patrols the room makes one more inspection before the next shift begins.
that will give you approximately 8 1/2 minutes to spoof the key card, break into the safe,
and retrieve Tulley's file before Vargas's informant can get to it.
Yeah, sure. Sounds simple.
make sure you point the reader at the key card.
anything else I should know?
Yeah, don't get caught.
thanks a lot. I'll try my best.
Fusco, what are you doing here?
what are you doing? - Uh, I was just leaving.
I'm just, uh, running an errand for the captain.
later. - Yeah, you have a good day.- All right.
detective Carter.
got three possible hits on that license plate.
it was logged by an automatic plate reader on a cruiser in south Brooklyn.
I'm gonna start looking.
I'm glad to hear it. Thank you, detective.
Fusco: Finch, Finch? You there?
I'm here. Go ahead.
all right. I'm going in now.
I'm-- I'm sorry. - That's fine.
presto. I'm in.
okay, what now?
turn off the fluorescents.
use that light I gave you.
do you see the prints?
start punching numbers. The code could be in any sequence.
we're running out of time, detective.
I tried every combination. It's not working.
a little help, please?
was one of the prints smudged?
Yeah, 5 is a little blurry, why?
it's used twice. Try 3-5-5-8.
can't believe it worked.
I've got Tulley's file. - Good job, detective.
Tulley's safe for now.
you have 23 seconds left.
detective Fusco, right?
my department investigated you and your buddies.
listen, this isn't what it looks like. I can explain.
explain shredding a confidential file?
you're under arrest.
I had to destroy that file.
there was a undercover whose life was in danger.
and you know this how?
I've got a guy-- Tells me things.
what guy? What things?
Finch: careful what you say, detective.
we can look after you, but these men are looking for our friend.
look, it doesn't make a difference who the guy is.
all you need to know is that a cop's life was on the line and I was trying to save him.
Yeah. I got a problem.
I couldn't get the file.
some idiot destroyed it.
but whoever the rat is, I got word he just made a phone call from your location.
what do you mean, somebody made a call? That's impossible.
I've got to take care of a situation.
I'll call you back later. - You're the informant.
Where's his phone?
whole let easier for me to search you after I shoot you.
he took it.
you kidding? Huh? - The hell I did.
get off me!
shouldn't be too hard to find out.
looks like we found our rat.
you tell the cops about l. O.S?
huh? The delivery?
you shouldn't waste time.
my reinforcements will be here any minute.
if that were true, I would have gotten a call from my guy and you'd be dead.
we're not getting anywhere.
give me time alone. I'll get him to talk.
you better get him to talk or you both catch a bullet.
who the hell are you?
I know you're not a cop. - No.
but I've been undercover.
I know the only thing you want in the world is to go home to your wife Melinda,
to your son Danny.
let's get one thing straight.
you don't know me.
I know your handler's name is Byrne.
I know you've been on the force since 2003.
I know you had a younger brother Connor who o. D.'D a month after you graduated high school.
how did you
that's why you're so committed to catching l. O.S.
what, are you a fed or something?
something.
I can help you escape.
help you get home.
if you know me so well, then you know I won't go home.
not while l. O.S. Is still operating.
your cover's gonna be blown.
you stay, you risk everything.
your life...
your family.
can you get a message to my wife?
tell her I love her.
we'll find a way to get you home.
and you can tell her yourself.
the exchange is at the scrapyard.
he's coming.
that's right.
he say anything yet?
I need more time.
okay, there's no more time.
ajax is dead. We've gotta dump the bodies.
no, no. Let me do it.
I want to see the look on his face as I end this rat.
help yourself.
what's the play here, John?
we're gonna kill this guy?
dissolve his body in a bathtub full of acid?
or are you just scratching an itch?
his name is Peter.
he's 37, makes 175, 000 a year.
is he a good guy or a serial killer?
I don't know.
but either way, he'll take better care of her than you could.
this is why I worried about bringing you back.
see, you look like the rest of these people...
but you're not like them anymore, are you?
if they knew what you'd done
you're barely even the same species.
we're walking in the dark.
I've heard this speech before.
Hey, uh...
sorry, I didn't realize you were meeting someone as well.
honey, you didn't tell him about your much -Better half?
there will be hell to pay later.
we should get going. - Wait.
two seconds.
um, I really want you to meet my wife.
she's going to get a kick out of meeting someone from puyallup.
I get it.
believe me.
first time I rotated back,
I went straight home to my family.
I sat outside in the rental car for three hours, just watching.
and I realized I could tell them everything that I'd seen,
everything that I'd done,
and they wouldn't understand a single word.
this isn't some speech.
we're not walking in the dark.
we are the dark.
Oh, Peter. - Jessica.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.
it's time to go, John.
there's a couple at the bar I want you to meet.
okay.
huh. - I guess it's just us?
Yeah. - Yeah.
what's the holdup?
he'll be harder to I. D. Without this.
car will burn hot enough.
won't be anything left to I. D.
need a lift?
I was in the neighborhood.
my lucky day.
your version of a lucky day is being shot and lit on fire?
not shot, just grazed.
lucky for me, Cahill's an excellent marksman.
it's for you.
Where's Cahill?
Oh, I'm...
fine, Finch. Thanks for asking.
Cahill went to the exchange with l. O.S.
without backup.
where? - South Brooklyn scrapyard.
headed there now.
you got any firearms besides that piece?
girl after my own heart.
Mr. Reese. - Yeah.
we have one other problem.
Vargas's informant has detective Fusco.
and his life is most certainly in danger.
Mr. Reese, I'm not sure we have time to save them both.
this is L. O.S?
you made a mess out of this.
next time, don't keep me waiting.
back! Back!
you stay back, or I spill your boss's brains on the asphalt.
do you know who you're threatening?
Where's your backup, son?
let him go.
you're going to have to shoot.
I wouldn't do that.
stay down. Don't nobody move.
on the ground.
you gonna arrest me?
I'll be out in 14 hours.
then I'm coming for you.
threatening a police officer.
I'll add that to the charges.
there won't be any charges.
at least none that stick.
he's CIA.
what?
the CIA's trafficking drugs?
the government couldn't win the war on drugs...
so they're using it to fund the war on terror.
this is common knowledge? - Doubtful.
the company's built on secrets.
I risked my life for this.
I'm taking him in.
you do and the company will ruin your career.
and that's if you're lucky.
I'm taking him in.
always liked to push my luck too.
do you know why I'm so good at my job, Fusco?
I can tell a dirty cop when I see one.
you should try looking in the mirror.
you know, you may think you've gone clean,
found God, Buddha, or some African Shaman,
but at the end of the day, your hands are still dirty.
always will be.
you hear that?
I don't hear nothing.
that's right.
no sirens, no bullhorns.
no one's coming to save you.
no one cares.
that guy-- The one who tells you things
he used you, then let you rot like a piece of garbage.
might as well tell me who it is.
at least you'll have the satisfaction of repaying the favor.
you think you're the first person to put a gun to my head?
no. But I will be the last.
Yeah, maybe you will.
you ever been shot?
craziest things go through your mind
glad I put on clean underwear, hid that stash of porn.
sorry that your son had to find out that his old man was a dirty cop.
then you realize you're gonna die.
you try to go down doing something good.
you wouldn't know about that, would you, you dirty sack?
kneel.
cutting it kind of close, don't you think?
at least I'm not late.
I gotta call this in.
I can make this a good shooting.
that phone is the only proof that this guy was working with Vargas?
Yeah. - Let me see it.
what the hell are you doing?
I can't have you coming clean, Lionel.
I need you inside HR.
get close to them.
there are cameras inside of 1pp.
people will know that I've left with this guy.
we're talking murder one. Don't you get it?
that's the point.
you'll need your friends at HR to help you cover this up.
I was just starting to enjoy being a good guy for a change.
you've done some nice work, Lionel.
I'm sorry, but you're more useful inside.
my hands are dirty, always will be, huh?
are we taking mommy to the hospital?
Yeah, champ.
you're about to have a new little brother.
I'm sure I forgot something.
honey, what is it? You okay?
I love you so much.
I know.
I thought you might like to know that agent Snow has arranged the release of L. O.S.
he'll be out in less than an hour.
what do you plan to do?
I'll keep an eye on Cahill and make sure he stays safe and sound.
he's about to have a screaming infant.
I doubt he'll be anywhere close to sound.
poor guy.
it's been a long time, Mark.
surprised they sent you down here for me.
you know the agency. They always take care of their own.
the whole deal went pear-shaped.
probably cost us 20 million, 30 million.
first thing to take care of are those two cops who brought me in
some undercover and a female detective.
I gave them both fair warning.
they gotta go.
we gotta send a message.
you're always impulsive, Ray.
you can't go around killing cops.
and you really shouldn't have gotten yourself arrested.
I warned you.
you're behind enemy lines here.
come on.
got your call.
looks like you got yourself in a little trouble.
it was an accident.
most accidents don't require a shovel.
help me make this go away.
I'll be indebted.
you'll be a little bit more than indebted, my friend.
you belong to HR now.
so nice to finally meet you, Harold.
you can call me Root.
when she took Finch, Root killed a former intelligence operative named Alicia Corwin.
you should be trying to figure out what I want and where we're going.
where are we going?
the future, Harold.
I've got a lead on Finch.
you know where our mystery woman's headed?
no, but I think I found out where she's from.
pack your bags, Carter, we're going to Texas.
911. What is your emergency?
Hello, who is this?
it's about Hanna, the girl who's gone missing.
so what's this all about?
what do you mean?
I promised you guys that round of drinks.
it's 8: 00 AM.
which means Finch has already been gone 24 hours, but we're gonna get him back.
this have a raw egg in it?
the alcohol will kill the salmonella.
you find out anything on the girl, Carter?
Yeah.
1991, 14-year-old Hanna Frey walks out of the public library in Bishop, Texas, never to be seen again.
she'd be 35 today.
seems about right.
that girl became Root, and now she's got Finch.
nothing else about her in any national law enforcement database since, John.
look, I need to know where you're getting your information.
I can't tell you that.
but we find out what happened to her, we find Finch.
this girl... Been gone 20 years without a trace.
how long you been drinking?
we're going to Bishop, Texas, to find out what happened to Hanna Frey.
what about me?
I need you to stay here, Lionel.
work the Alicia Corwin case.
find out why Corwin was in New York, and find out who's messing with the case.
maybe this'll help.
did you just jack my phone?
it's a malware app.
little tip- someone offers you a great deal on any sort of male-enhancement pill, don't click on it.
Oh, another thing.
I need you to look after a friend of mine.
bear, remember Lionel?
where are we on the Corwin mess?
a few loose ends to clean up, but I wouldn't worry about the evidence trail.
consider the chain of custody broken.
we need to find out what brought her to New York.
I think I have a lead on where she was staying in the city.
just make sure you get there first.
no telling what kind of smoking gun that nut job left lying around.
a dead nut job.
used to work for Denton Weeks.
let me worry about Weeks.
what do we know about the assigned working the case?
I wouldn't sweat that too much.
not exactly New York's finest working on this one.
okay. Lucky you called when you did.
deer season just started.
booked up solid for the week.
Oh, I don't think so.
we're gonna need another room.
afraid I can't help you there.
I've got three RVs backed up in the lot looking for a room with running water.
Thanks. This won't be a problem.
so what exactly are the sleeping arrangements?
I don't plan on sleeping much.
and if I do, the bathtub will - the floor will be fine.
let's go down to the police station and get ahold of that case file on Hanna Frey.
OK. Wait.
let's set up some ground rules here.
you keep a low profile and let me deal with the local law enforcement, all right?
that's why you're here.
it's regarding the Hanna Frey case back in '91.
Oh, yes, ma'am, I remember it well.
what's your interest in the case, Detective, uh... - Carter.
I may have a missing persons case in the Bronx that matches the MO.
a young girl went missing from a public library, like Hanna Frey, and one of my suspects used to live in Texas.
Really? What's the suspect's name?
unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to share names.
still a developing case.
sheriff, I'd really just like to have a look at Hanna's case file.
Yeah, well, I'd really like to have the name of this suspect, seeing as how it might help break a case that's haunted this department some 20 years.
right.
unfortunately, my loo hasn't signed off on a joint investigation.
I don't see why not.
he sent you all the way down here, didn't he?
sign here, please.
well, hello.
what happened to Dan today?
he got rerouted.
well, that is too bad.
mind if I use your restroom?
Oh, help yourself.
it's just down the hall and to the left.
all right, I'll tell you what.
why don't you give me the name and number of your loo, and I'll call him myself.
no?
well, that's too bad.
well, I hope you enjoy your stay here in Bishop.
hunting and fishing, second to none.
what the - Is that what I think it is?
plenty of leads to follow up on.
here.
I don't know what you just did, but this is not the way
there was even a 911 call from someone claiming they saw Hanna get into the car that night.
they gave a plate number too, but it didn't check out.
what do you think?
I think we start from the beginning.
we need to talk to whoever saw Hanna last.
she's still out there, Carter.
I'm telling you, that girl became Root.
amazing.
we've managed to perfect the apple - a genetically modified version that never goes brown.
and yet, we still haven't upgraded human beings.
the human race has stalled out, Harold.
and from what I've seen, most of it is rotten to the core.
Oh, Harold, generous to a fault.
always letting someone else take credit for your work.
I'd recognize your code anywhere.
it's so... elegant.
then let it be.
I told you, I don't want to control your machine.
then why are we here?
we're here to observe another kind of code.
the bad code.
clearly, we differ in our views of humanity.
do we?
then why are you the father of a seismic shift in intelligence, forced to live in fear and anonymity?
you don't know anything about me.
Oh, but I do, Harold.
you're the man who sold the world.
just to the wrong people.
I will get access to the machine, Harold.
and either you can show me how to do that, or this sad specimen will.
Denton Weeks - the man you sold the machine to.
one of you will walk out of here onto the next stage of our adventure.
I do hope it's you, Harold.
of course I remember.
I only wish I could forget.
Hanna was a bright girl.
mostly kept to herself.
did you notice anything off about her that night?
not really.
she was at the computers over there.
like she was almost every night.
we didn't have internet back then, just a couple of PCs and a few games.
educational, of course.
you gave the police a list of everyone who was in the library that night?
Yes. Thank you.
the library was about to close.
everyone was leaving.
I see you found the new Stephen King.
I really enjoyed the last one.
Thanks, Barbara.
damn it.
death by dysentery again.
that game's so dumb, Hanna.
I don't see why you play it.
because I'm gonna get to Oregon.
the library will be closing in ten minutes.
bring any books you'd like to check out to the counter.
see ya. - Bye.
Hanna checked out a couple of books.
thank you. - Good night, Hanna.
and then she was gone.
that's the last time anyone ever saw her?
I had no idea there was something to worry about until I got a call from Sheriff Landry in the middle of the night saying Hanna never made it home.
her parents still live here?
her mother passed a few years ago.
I still see her father every once in a while.
ma'am. Thank you.
you don't believe Hanna could still be alive.
that was my wife's curse.
refused to believe Hanna was gone.
thought she was still out there somewhere.
do you have any idea what happened?
of course I do.
everyone in town knows what happened.
the cops interrogated that son of a bitch for over two days.
it wasn't the first time he followed her home, but they can't prove a damn thing without a body.
then one night, me and my brother paid Cody a visit.
did you get the truth?
the smirking son of a bitch said he never touched her.
said she probably ran to escape her jerk of a father.
what ever happened to Cody?
most nights I hear he's rotting his guts out at The Razorback.
thank you.
anyone ever reach out to you after Hanna was gone?
any correspondence or information that might help us?
nothing except some credit card junk mail a couple times a year.
but they were in Hanna's name?
did she have a credit card or a bank account?
no, she was still a minor.
you got one of those letters?
I threw out another one a couple of days ago.
probably still in the trash.
Hey, you think it's odd that Alicia Corwin didn't have her hotel key on her person?
maybe she left it at the hotel.
maybe she left everything at the hotel.
because that's not the only discrepancy between what's listed in evidence and what's actually here.
Yeah, ballistics report was corrupted too.
someone really wants this to go away.
you find that person, maybe you'll get some answers.
and, Fusco, be careful who you read in on the case.
Yeah. All right. I'll talk with you later.
okay.
look at the guy in the suit.
Cody Grayson.
Hey, Wall Street.
you lost?
end of the bar.
look at this guy.
who's that?
Hello, Cody.
I know you?
you knew someone I'm looking for.
you a journalist or a fed?
neither.
good.
get off of him!
I asked you nicely.
let's try that again.
what did you do with Hanna Frey?
what do you want me to say, man, that I cut her up, dumped her in the swamp?
ain't nothing you can do this town hasn't already done worse.
what happened to Hanna? Where is she?
if I knew, maybe I'd still be able to see out of this eye.
let me guess - Cody Grayson.
I thought I'd buy him a round.
making friends, huh?
Yeah, you'll never get the truth out of anybody like that.
I already did. He didn't do it.
I could have told you that.
looks like you might be right about Hanna Frey.
junk mail with her name on it.
ran a credit check.
discovered a bank account opened in her name back in '93, two years after she disappeared.
so either Hanna's communicating from beyond the grave, or... - She's still alive.
can you please make this stop?
another hour in that hood, and he'll believe anything I say.
amazing how easily the human brain can be manipulated.
but you know that, don't you, Denton?
a top-secret DOD memo authorizing enhanced interrogation techniques, including "Palestinian hanging," which you are currently enjoying.
whose signature is at the end?
why, it's yours.
please... water.
sorry, not allowed.
unless you tell me what I want to know.
lady, I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm a White House lawyer.
I sign documents. I don't read 'em.
please, for the love of God, let me down.
if you tell me where the machine is.
what machine?
the machine he built.
the machine Nathan Ingram sold you for one US dollar.
you know where it is.
I don't know anything. I swear.
really, Harold, why do men always seek to delay the inevitable?
what happened to you?
me?
you think I was damaged?
some childhood trauma?
that is so sweet.
let him down.
please.
well, you did say please.
water, please.
Oh, we need to get this show on the road.
and since you just drank half a pint of sodium pentothal, that gives me time to go gas up the car.
by the time I get back, you'll be ready to spill everything in your little head.
you.
I know you.
you work with Nathan Ingram.
you have to help me get free.
we have a major problem.
she cannot get access to the machine.
assuming Hanna runs away, a couple years later, she winds up in Lafayette, Louisiana, opens an account, 100 grand is paid in, withdrawn in cash over the next three weeks until the account is closed.
100 grand.
where does a 16-year-old runaway get all that money?
jose Barilla, currently serving 17 life sentences for drug trafficking and murder.
the money was electronically transferred out of his account.
you did say this Root woman was good with computers.
Yes, I did.
but where does the account lead us?
right back here.
there was a co-signatory on the account.
a guy named Trent Russell.
local address, right here in Bishop.
name sounds familiar.
Yeah, he was on the witness list, in the library that night she disappeared.
you still got that address?
who is it?
Mrs. Russell, it's Detective Carter. Is your husband at home?
Mrs. Russell?
uh, yes.
Trent Russell is your husband?
can we talk to him?
Trent passed away almost 15 years ago.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
can we come in?
Oh, come in.
we were only married a few years.
we met at the library.
Trent was a member of the monthly book club.
I miss him so much.
how did he die?
it was awful. He was attacked.
shot to death.
they know who did it?
police said it looked like a drug killing, some trash from over the border, but never caught them.
Trent was a bank loan officer.
is it possible he got caught up in money laundering?
no, he was a good man. It was just a mistake.
how long did he know Hanna Frey?
he didn't.
then how do you explain this?
he signed for a bank account in her name two years after she disappeared.
this must be some kind of mistake.
Yeah, just like his murder.
you mind if we look around the place? - Yes, I do.
you need to leave now.
that 911 call.
the witness who saw Hanna get into the car - there was a license plate.
Oh, hold on.
caller.
it's about Hanna, the girl who's gone missing.
I think I saw her get into a car outside the library.
the operator asked about the make of car, but the only thing the caller can remember is the license plate - 925 ESK."
the caller got one digit wrong.
or the operator did.
are we saying this is the car?
Trent Russell kidnapped Hanna Frey?
maybe - maybe Russell took her, but she escaped.
she got her revenge.
how can say that?
because of the bank account in Russell's name.
it's how Root works.
she set him up.
she stole 100 grand from a drug dealer.
when he found out it was missing, the person he went after was Russell.
Russell denies it, but it's useless.
his name is on the account.
the only other name is that of a girl who's been dead for two years.
he has to be lying.
please, please!
so the man who kidnapped Hanna gets gunned down in a parking lot.
and his victim is in the wind, 100 grand the richer.
it's Root.
it has to be Root.
we need to search that house.
we need to call the Sheriff.
we need to handle this the right way, John.
she'll come back soon.
I know you're reluctant to trust me- you don't know me
Oh, I do know who you are, Mr. Weeks.
you tried to hack the machine.
I certainly tried. It was my job.
I had to test its limits, see if it was safe.
but in all of our crisis scenarios, we never envisioned this.
that someone would get to one of us.
she won't get to the machine through me.
but you must see that if you don't help me get free, we will lose the machine.
what can I do?
the knife.
try to push it to me.
stop. Stop it!
don't worry! Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill her.
at least not until I've found out what she knows.
so... Ingram's little IT guy.
we always suspected the idiot in the tux couldn't have done it on his own.
what do you want?
I want to know what you know.
flowers For Algernon.
the book Hanna checked out that night at the library.
16 copies hidden in your bedroom.
Where'd you get 'em?
they just come... every year.
every year on the same date.
what date?
april 15th.
the day Hanna disappeared.
they just arrive from all over the country.
no note, no sender.
like someone just wants to be cruel.
the most recent book did have something.
I'm gonna find out who bought it.
you stay here.
she's not done yet.
she really sent me over the edge.
so what's your plan, Mr. Weeks?
tidy this up, get some real experts to question this bitch.
but since anonymity means a lot to you, and because you helped me,
I'm gonna let you go wherever you want.
just one more question.
can she get to it?
I need to know if it's safe.
you are the one man who can tell me.
please.
it cannot be altered remotely.
if anyone wanted to change anything, they'd have to have physical access to the servers?
that's right.
so if the location is hidden, the machine is safe.
that's all I need.
it's been an honor to meet you... at last.
what did I say, Harold?
bad code.
Hey, here he comes.
heard you were staying here, buddy.
not now, fellas.
think it's time for a rematch.
don't think you're gonna sucker punch me again.
this is Detective Stills, NYPD Homicide.
I'm calling about a book you sold at the beginning of April,
flowers For Algernon. I need to trace the buyer.
911, what is your emergency?
it's about Hanna, the girl who's gone missing.
I think I saw her get into a car outside the library.
what sort of car?
I don't know.
it was a dark car.
do you remember anything else?
Yes, the license plate.
it goes on.
the girl was asked but wouldn't give her name.
then she hung up.
barb knows who it is... don't you?
Oh, it's Sam Groves.
she was in the library that night with Hanna.
she was friends with Hanna?
Hanna looked out for her.
flowers For Algernon. You should read it.
it's awesome.
damn it.
death by dysentery again.
that game's so dumb, Hanna.
I don't see why you play it.
cause I'm gonna get to Oregon.
the library will be closing in ten minutes.
bring any books you'd like to check out to the counter.
see ya. - Bye.
Sam was 12. Funny kid.
lived with her mom outside town.
mom wasn't well.
I guess that's why she always hung around the library.
why are you sure it was Sam made the call? There were other girls there.
it was Sam.
how do you know?
because she told me the same thing.
she said she saw Hanna get into a car.
barb, why didn't you tell me?
because Sam saw who was in the car.
and she told you, didn't she?
she said... she thought it was Mr. Russell.
why in the hell didn't you say anything?
I did. I did say something... to her.
I told her she was a nasty, attention-seeking brat, and I couldn't believe she'd think such a terrible thing about somebody like Mr. Russell, who'd done so much for this town and the library and all the children.
and then I told her to keep her lying little mouth shut.
Why?
because I was in love with Trent Russell, and I couldn't believe he'd do such a thing.
what do you believe now?
the patio?
he redid it, two weeks after Hanna disappeared.
Yes, this is Detective Stills, NYPD, calling in connection to a missing-child case.
a transfer was made from an account at your bank to a bookstore in Seattle.
account name was Von Neumann.
last four digits, 4253.
Hey, buddy, uh, no trouble.
we just need to get our stuff, you hear? - Police business.
whoa, whoa. We're good.
Yes, I'm here.
found something.
same book.
Yes, I need to check for recent activity on a credit card in the name of Dyson.
gas station in Relton, Maryland?
just after 4: 00 AM.
about three hours ago.
gotcha.
you knew I'd help him, didn't you?
you let him beat you up, take your gun - you planned the whole thing.
that's who you gave your machine to.
violent and predictable people.
but you must see I'm on your side.
I'm not on any side.
you know what I mean.
I am the best friend, the best support, the best partner you will ever have.
and definitely the most fun.
no. You're worse than Weeks. You're worse than all of them.
I'd rather die than give you the machine, so please kill me now.
at least I won't have to listen to you anymore.
you're tired...
and I'm bloody.
I'm gonna go clean up.
Carter, you can keep the rental.
guys are lending me a truck.
why is there a crossbow on the bed?
long story, but we're friends now. Gotta go. Got a line on a private jet in Galveston.
where are you going?
back East.
look... this book led us to a bookstore, to a bank, to a bank, to a bank, to a credit card, which was used in Maryland about three hours ago.
it's Root.
Hanna is Root. She's alive, and I know where she is.
she's not Hanna.
Hanna's in the ground, John.
she's dead.
she never did get away from Russell.
then who'd do this?
who sent the books, got Russell killed?
Hanna's father gave it to me.
her name's Sam Groves.
she was Hanna's friend.
she saw Hanna get into Russell's car that night.
she told Barb, called 911, but nobody would listen.
where is she now?
only child. Her mother died about ten years ago.
so Sam left town, was never heard from again.
if anybody's Root, it's gotta be her.
then she's the one who took Finch.
I know where she is.
I'm going after her.
who is this guy?
looks like I found Corwin's hideaway.
Hey, it worked. How do you say that in Dutch?
nothing here.'Cause they beat you to it, smart guy.
forget it, we got a bigger problem.
Denton Weeks - he's disappeared. He's not answering any of his phones.
you got any leads?
it seems Weeks had a woman on the side.
get down. - Julie Davenport.
apparently, they used to sneak off to her love shack outside of DC.
just find it.
sorry I took so long.
a mild sedative.
I apologize, but I need you to be a little more... amenable.
well, well, it seems I underestimated your knuckle-dragging friend.
how he got there I do not know.
did the machine help him, do you think?
something for us to discuss on our journey.
I hope you like trains.
come on, Harold.
one more question, and then I'll leave you alone.
Where's the machine?
this time, it is loaded.
now, where did you move the machine?
I'm telling you, I don't know.
wait.
july 12, 2009, it was boxed up and put on a train.
with that amount of servers, of course it was a train. But a train to where?
it started in Des Moines.
then it was transferred to Union Pacific railway, bound for Salt Lake City.
and that's all I know.
that's a start.
you have no idea what you're getting into.
Harold... did you think I'd forget to disconnect the phones?
off we go.
I just landed in Maryland.
I'm at a gas station.
she was here this morning.
I've been trying to reach you for hours.
have you got something, Fusco?
I think the broad who took your friend is also going after a guy by the name of Denton Weeks, who's in the same type of government business as Corwin was, and he's missing.
the feds are flying around trying to find him.
you know where they're looking?
apparently, he's got a girlfriend who's got a cottage outside of DC.
all I got is a name - Julie Davenport.
search property records in Relton, Maryland, for a Julie Davenport.
I just want to see if the train's on time, Harold.
can I remind you of our deal?
try anything, innocent people get hurt.
tap code. Finch... Really?
train station.
the outbound train with direct service from Baltimore to Salt Lake City will be departing from track seven.
you'll like the West, Harold.
fewer people, bigger skies.
more space to think.
how did he find us?
because you're wrong.
he proves you're wrong.
not all humans are bad code.
you helped him.
I told you what would happen if you tried to get away.
excuse me, sir.
can I help you, ma'am?
help! Shooters!
don't move. Don't move.
am I hit?
I don't think so. Sorry it took so long.
I really didn't intend for you to come and find me, Mr. Reese.
there are other people that need your help.
well, you saved my life once or twice, Harold.
seemed only fair I return the favor.
Hey, yourself.
Where's the dog?
Wonderboy came and took him.
so we got our friend with the glasses back, huh?
Yeah, we did.
buy you a drink?
long as it don't have egg in it.
Harold, meet Bear.
unfortunately, my apartment has a strict policy regarding dogs.
I have a strict policy regarding rare first editions. Namely, don't eat them.
bear, laat vallen.
Asimov.
he has expensive taste.
I'm sure we'll get along.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
did you see it happen?
no, but she did.
she saw everything.
Where's the girl now?
are you sure you can keep her safe?
of course.
new York
did you know that the first public cell phone call was made from the New York Hilton? 1973.
there's also a rumor that the Martini was invented at the Knickerbocker, but there are some people in San Francisco that would dispute that.
I feel like I should be taking notes.
you find my fascination with hotels to be peculiar, don't you?
you sharing anything personal is peculiar.
a hotel is one of the last few places where a person can retain relative anonymity.
makes it easier when disappearing foreign diplomats from their penthouses.
with any luck, Mr. Reese, we can prevent a murder, rather than the alternative.
Yeah.
you sure the threat to her is work-related?
ms. Dobrica is single, lives alone, doesn't do much social networking, and she puts in a 60-hour work week.
whatever's gonna happen, it makes sense that it would happen here.
they say a maid can tell everything about you from how you leave your room.
all sorts of things happen in hotel rooms.
Mira's job could have put her at the wrong place at the wrong time.
what about her life before coming to america?
bit of a mystery.
she came here in '99, when computer records weren't what they are today.
I put in a call to immigration services, as a prospective employer.
would that be Mr. Wren from universal heritage insurance?
you know, her shift starts in five minutes, which means that ours starts in four.
they were hiring a bellhop and a concierge.
the choice seemed obvious.
I interviewed last night, made sure that your resume would stand out.
Oh, by the way, you worked at the hotel Lutetia in Paris for two years.
you'll have access to every room with your employee key card.
I can research the guests and exploit any necessary systems from my desk.
700 guests in this hotel.
one of them is planning a murder.
where do we start?
glad you could start on such short notice.
Derek, my pleasure.
when you're on the clock, it's Mr. Fowler.
this is Bud, my head doorman.
and you are again?
John. I worked at the hotel Lutetia.
right.
your desk is right over there.
remember, always recommend our restaurant before suggesting anywhere else.
very good.
we're hosting an event for the association of aviation technology tomorrow, and most of the attendees are arriving today, so...
no excuse for standing around.
are you waiting for a written invitation?
let me help you with that.
Mr. Reese,Mira should be housekeeping on the 30th floor.
I just finished a run on 12. I'll head up.
haven't seen you since the divorce.
you working? - Yeah.
you working? - Always.
like the suit.
I'm planting the camera on her cart.
we can see exactly where she is at all times.
I didn't take your money.
I had 50 bucks in my wallet, and now I don't.
Finch, who's in room 3024?
tug brantley, CEO of the Aggro Push Energy Drink.
I'm a platinum member of this place.
do you have any idea how difficult I can make your life?
come on.
what do you want from me?
I wanna know if those lips taste like the chocolate mints you leave on my pillow.
I'm going to come back when you're not here.
are you really going to turn me down?
is there a problem here?
who invited you in?
Mr. Reese, could you try not to get fired before lunch?
being a platinum member doesn't entitle you to sexually harass our staff.
if you disagree, we can have the police sort this out.
you're lucky I don't report you to your boss.
are you all right?
I'm fine. That sort of thing happens every other week, you know.
I could have handled it.
sounds like a rough gig.
I'm John. - Mira.
so strong, handsome guy your age working as a bellhop.
must have made a wrong turn somewhere.
Yeah, I stopped counting awhile back.
well you're in for a rough gig yourself.
our brilliant manager should have staffed four bellhops.
instead, it's just you and Randy, and he takes more smoke breaks than he does luggage.
you seem to know your way around this place.
hotel management is hard work, but it's not rocket science.
speaking of which, I should get back to work.
guess I'll be seeing you around then.
Oh, I really like this girl, Finch.
I heard back from immigration services.
Mira sought asylum as a Serbian refugee, a survivor of the Kosovo war.
I thought most refugees from that war were Albanian.
most were, but both sides suffered losses.
seeing as how mira came alone, we can only assume that whatever family she had didn't make it out.
she was 16 at the time.
she's been on her own ever since.
here's a map of midtown.
that's the theater district, Columbus circle, and the beginning of the park. It's a good start.
thank you.
I managed to hack into the security network and piggyback on their feeds, allowing me access to all the hotel's cameras.
uh, excuse me. Where's the
Oh, the ladies' is around-- and the gents', the opposite.
is something wrong?
police were asking questions about our little side operation.
it got me thinking about how they knew to poke around in the first place.
it--it wasn't me.
no. You're not stupid enough to do a thing like that because you know how upset I would be if i found out it was you.
of course.
Mr. Reese, we can add hotel staff to our list of potential threats.
sir. - Welcome back to the land of the free.
getting out of rikers took longer than I anticipated.
I understand our rogue operative slipped away from you in there.
it won't happen again. I know his face now.
need you to work fast.
ever since he assaulted our d. O.D. Facility, our source has become compromised.
compromised, sir?
this man has connections to a dangerous party.
it's imperative that you find him and figure out who he works for.
wherever he goes, a mess usually follows.
all I have to do is find the right mess.
I'm sure you'll work it out, and when you're done with him, make sure no one finds him.
understood.
any available units, please respond to a 10-50 in progress at the intersection of 46th and 3rd.
Thanks.
Hey, so listen, there's something you should know.
I'm in a bit of... Trouble.
serious? - Yeah.
my mom wants to set me up with this woman who goes to her church.
well, that's pretty serious. - Yeah.
What'd you say?
that I'm seeing someone.
it could be serious.
that right?
I don't know.
have you told your son anything?
mm, I may have mentioned a thing or two, that I met a man who's nice and funny, easy on the eyes.
Taylor's happy for me, so what do you think about meeting him?
I'm cool with it.
you? - I think it might be time.
but let's talk more about it later. I gotta go.
okay. - Okay.
s. A.I. C. Moss.
didn't think i'd ever see you here again.
I'm on a matter regarding special agent Donnelly.
after he died, I took it upon myself to review his old files.
found something that might interest you.
I discovered a recommendation to make you a field agent.
Donnelly ever discuss that with you?
once or twice, yeah.
I'm ready to run it up the flagpole, but only if you're still interested.
I am. - Great.
then with your permission, we'll initiate the background check, interview friends, family, any contacts from the past ten years.
okay, whatever you need.
are you available to take a polygraph this evening?
polygraph?
standard procedure. You can take it here in the precinct.
okay, it shouldn't be a problem.
then we'll see you later. - Okay.
you really gonna go through with this?
Yeah. I guess so.
the spa's located past the elevator banks, through a glass door on your right.
you can't miss it. - Sounds great.
everything all right, Mr. Reese?
I feel like I'm back at boot camp, and we still haven't zeroed in on the threat to Mira yet.
same girl we saw before, but she's with a different guy.
the side operation Derek's running might be girls.
I made a similar observation.
detective carter should be getting back to me soon on any known solicitation activity.
look who has time to chat.
a bus just arrived full of airplane geeks.
check them in, and let's make sure they don't crowd up the common areas.
Oh, I really hope Derek's the threat.
detective Carter.
I checked with vice.
they picked up a working girl a few days ago at that hotel off an anonymous tip, but the girl didn't say boo, and her bail was posted within an hour.
by whom? - By a guy named Bud Garrison.
our floor manager's pet.
thank you.
anything else?
should there be?
I just assume you heard my conversation with Moss.
I hear everything, detective.
so you know he thinks I'm qualified to join the feds.
well, what do you think?
I just think it'll be a great opportunity, assuming I get in.
you're concerned about the polygraph.
considering I've been lying about you guys for over a year, a little.
you know, polygraphs don't detect lies, just physiological responses.
try lying on one of the baseline questions, it might trick the test into thinking that everything you say is normal.
Yeah, it's just a machine, right?
I mean, how smart can it be?
exactly.
just a machine.
Oh, in the meantime, it might be wise for you to steer clear of John and myself, just for the time being.
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.
Thanks.
looks like Derek is running an escort service.
if Mira called in the tip, he might be our threat.
the sooner we can confirm it, the sooner we can go home.
housekeeping.
sorry, we don't need service. My wife forgot to put the sign out.
no problem.
housekeeping.
I need to talk to you.
I can't now.
you know this can't wait.
Mr. Reese?
Mira's just been summoned into room 3215 by a guest.
she didn't look particularly happy to see him.
you must be exhausted, dropping bags off all day.
according to his hotel bill, Mr. Harris drinks more than he eats, and we have no way of knowing what's going on in the room because Mira left her phone on her cart.
she's three floors above you.
how late do you deliver room service?
I believe the hotel delivers room service
I'm not talking about the hotel.
I'm talking about you.
feel free to drop yourself off... Anytime.
excuse me.
I'm on the 32nd floor now.
don't try to push me, Harris.
but you need to listen to reason.
how can you expect me to agree to this?
because it's the right thing to do.
easy for you to say.
next time, damn well knock.
what are you doing here?
I was checking the minibar.
I'll save you the trouble. It's empty.
we'll talk later.
ms. Brozi, Ms. Brozi!
please reconsider.
what's your problem?
that's the second time you've walked in on me.
it's Derek, isn't it?
he has you following me around.
are you in some kind of trouble with him?
I know he's running girls out of here.
I also know you're involved.
I clean the rooms, that's my job.
I've worked too hard to get involved in some sleazy scheme.
is that why you tipped off the police?
that's none of your business.
what about the booze hound in there? I heard the yelling.
he's harmless. It was nothing.
are you sure about that, Ms. Dobrica?
or is that "Brozi"?
you know nothing about me, what I've seen, what I've been through.
I don't need help, especially from someone like you.
just stay away from me, got it?
we do have a good steakhouse here in the hotel, but...
personally, I'd recommend the Grand.
best rib eye in town. You will not be disappointed.
shall I put you down for 7: 30?
sure, thanks. - Okay.
I've been researching our guest.
Charles Harris is a freelance journalist working with a number of respected publications.
he's the kind of writer that has strong opinions about world leaders, making him persona non grata in a half dozen countries.
what's his interest in Mira?
not sure, but if he came all this way to talk to her, she might be some kind of source.
a girl who flees her country and changes her name is someone who doesn't want to be found.
but if she's hiding, who's she hiding from?
that guy in the turtleneck.
he's been sitting there since we arrived.
have you seen him move at all?
I don't believe so.
Yeah, well, he's got a clear line of sight of the front desk and the entrance.
might be waiting for somebody.
and if he's not?
then what's he still doing here?
how do you suggest we find out?
what ya readin'?
nothing, it was here when I sat down.
good. Can't stand these airplane nuts.
I mean, the pickup-- Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.
I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay, it's fine.
I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it.
who's he talking to?
pull up the downstairs feeds.
watch the man at the bar.
the man at the side entrance is taking his place.
they're spotters.
they're rotating positions to patch the gaps in their surveillance.
military recon tactic.
it's a hit squad, Finch.
at least it's safe to say that we found the real threat to Mira.
who would send a hit squad with military training to kill a hotel maid?
our spotter is headed back downstairs, Finch.
Where's Mira?
she's in the kitchen, taking a break.
well, I'm going to check out his room.
that room is registered to a Peter Krieg, checked in under a german passport.
could be a forged identity.
we need to know who sent the team.
any new information on Harris?
I see that his laptop is signed onto the hotel wi-fi.
if I can get past his firewall, I can see what kind of notes he has on Mira.
our spotter has a file on Harris.
whatever's going on, it has to do with a series of articles Harris wrote about a Serbian colonel named Rudko Petrovic.
that name sounds familiar.
I believe he's running for deputy prime minister.
Harris all but accused him of committing war crimes in Kosovo.
how does Mira fit into all this?
I think I just found out.
I'm in Harris's computer.
not only is her real last name "Brozi," but she's ethnic Albanian, not Serbian.
according to Harris's notes, Mira witnessed petrovic order the execution of her entire family.
it makes sense that she lied to immigration about her name and ethnicity, she was simply protecting herself.
and Harris found the one witness who could bring down the colonel.
they must have followed him to the hotel, hoping he would establish contact with his source.
they'll make their move on Mira as soon as they identify her.
they may already have.
what's the e. T.A. On our backup?
arriving as we speak.
always a bar.
Hi, give me a ginger ale.
Mr. Reese, all three spotters are back in their original positions.
keep an eye on them.
we'll deal with those guys after I get Mira out of here.
you just don't give up, do you?
John, the man at the side entrance is moving.
why won't you just leave me alone?
that a good enough reason?
he was going to kill me... For talking to the journalist.
he was going to kill you for knowing what Petrovic did to your family in Kosovo.
what does that make you?
just a guy at the right place at the right time.
conection lost
Mr. Reese, I've lost the connection to Harris's computer... And eyes on his floor.
you'd better get to Mr. Harris's room immediately.
stay close to me.
all right, like to start with a few basic questions.
is your name Jocelyn Carter? - Yes.
are you a member of the homicide task force in New York? - Yes.
have you ever smoked marijuana?
Yes. College.
you're the first one to admit that.
okay, now, we can move on to the important stuff.
Mr. Reese?
it seems that Mr. Harris remotely checked out of his room a few minutes ago.
he's not here.
any chance another maid cleaned this room?
not today. This is my floor.
you notice anything out of the ordinary?
the chair-- it's usually over there.
we're too late.
they move fast.
cleaned up best they could.
I thought he was a drunk.
yesterday, he tells me he knows who I am, that Petrovic is the man who killed my family.
how did you escape, Mira?
Sanja, a Serbian woman across the street.
I watched it happen from her attic.
then the man, Harris, found Sanja last month, made a tape of her saying I could identify the colonel.
she was found dead two weeks ago, probably from talking to the journalist.
he said if I went public, it would ensure my safety, but I refused.
look how far this monster is willing to go.
what choice do I have?
I'm gonna get you out of here, Mira, but I need to know how they found out about you.
did you tell anyone you were talking with Harris?
no, nobody.
then how could they have known you were the witness?
unless... Give me your cell phone.
the electromagnetic field of a microphone...
can interfere... With a cell phone.
they overheard everything in this room.
they're next door.
wait here.
she's running for it, Finch.
Finch, she just got on the elevator.
Mira, I was just looking for you.
Mr. Reese, I'm afraid Mira's in there with another member of the hit squad.
and she has nowhere to run.
do exactly as I say.
use your key card and take us straight to the basement.
I may be able to stall the elevator before it gets to the basement, might give you a chance to get Mira out of there.
I'm a little busy, Lionel.
Yeah, one of your trained killers is leaving his post.
so is the one in the lobby.
he's taking rather a large trunk with him. I don't know what they could possibly
Oh, dear. It's Harris.
they're disposing of the body.
body? What body?
detective, you can't let them leave the hotel.
the recording, where is it?
I don't know of any recording.
the one of Sanja, your old neighbor, it wasn't in his room or on his computer.
I swear, I don't have it.
no? Too bad.
I don't know who you are, but I'm prepared to shoot you and 20 others like you to get what I came for.
glad that you're a better shot than you are a bellhop.
so am I.
detective, the barfly just left the building through the back exit.
Yeah, okay, I'm on it.
Oh, excuse me.
uh, sorry. Just looking for the bathroom.
I thought I saw a sign, but
Yeah, why don't you try right up those stairs in the lobby?
Oh, yeah. Thanks, buddy.
what do you say we get you out of here now?
not yet.
we have to get the tape Harris made of Sanja.
it's evidence Petrovic killed her.
you said you didn't have it.
I lied.
he gave me a disc to take home and watch.
thought it would persuade me to tell my story.
it's down in my locker.
well, that and your testimony would be enough to put Petrovic away.
assuming I live long enough.
I'll come back for the disc after we get you out of here.
we don't know how many hit men are left.
drop us off on the next floor, then shut this elevator down.
who are you talking to?
hello. This is Harold. I work with John.
it's a pleasure to meet you, Mira. - Sure.
Hey, excuse me, guys.
have you seen a little chihuahua?
he's a little dog about this big.
Ah, Jeez.
Yeah. - I've got a new assignment for you.
meet me at the annex south of the lobby.
Yeah, no problem.
I'm fine, by the way, considering I just took out two trained killers trying to get rid of a body.
never doubted you for a second. Now, come and meet me.
I'll be right there.
let me just call these two in.
Oh, and don't forget the guys in the storage room and the elevator.
Seriously?
got something?
big mess at the Coronet hotel.
couple guys with gunshot wounds have been tied up and gift-wrapped.
sounds like our man.
what are you still talking to me for?
this friend of yours, he's a policeman?
Yeah.
listen, Mira, he'll take you to his precinct.
it's the safest place for you until this is over.
I've never really felt safe since I left Kosovo.
I was a girl when I ran away.
new name, new country, I tried to leave all that behind.
but it's like I've just been waiting for all this to come back somehow, afraid of what would happen to me if it did.
from what I've seen, you're a lot braver than you think.
I allowed Rudko Petrovic get away with murder.
my family, Sanja, now Harris.
no more.
Petrovic must be held accountable.
you rang?
Mira, this is Lionel, and you can trust him.
nice to meet you.
all right, you ready?
thank you, John.
you're welcome.
okay, come on.
this way.
Finch, now would be a good time to tender your resignation.
have you ever lied to people you work with? - No.
have you ever knowingly associated with a wanted criminal? - No.
have you
what was that about?
how would you describe your relationship with narcotics detective Cal Beecher?
Cal? - You describe it as... Platonic?
intimate?
we see each other socially.
are you aware of any of the several i. A.B. Investigations into detective Beecher?
investigations for what?
I'm not at liberty to say.
so you were not aware of any of the ongoing investigations
no. I was not aware.
where the hell have you been?
you really have no idea what's going on in your hotel, do you?
you're me.
you find a first day employee sneaking around in the ladies' locker room.
what do you do?
I don't know, something like this?
I've got the disc.
meet you back at the library.
you're a hard man to find.
the phone please.
how about we go somewhere a little more private?
that's some line of questioning.
hope it gets easier from here.
unfortunately, this can't go any further.
I'm rescinding your offer to join the bureau.
I'm sorry, detective, sometimes these things don't work out.
why not?
I can't divulge that.
I gave you plenty of answers in that room.
I can get one from you.
in the future, I'd choose my company more wisely.
Yeah. Yeah, all right.
can i get you a soda? - I'm fine. Thank you.
okay, if you need anything, I'll be right out here, okay?
you missed all the fun.
Wonderboy and I jump-started an international incident.
shame I couldn't be there.
you say you were mugged?
Yeah, guy took my wallet and my watch.
okay.
just wait right here, sir.
someone will be by shortly to take your statement.
Thanks, buddy.
get out. Get out!
this can go one of two ways.
don't suppose one of those ways involves me walking out of here.
didn't think so.
I don't care who you are.
I don't care what you did to get here.
all I want to know is who you work for.
but that would be telling.
what makes you think I'm working for anyone, anyway?
because you're like me.
we don't give orders, we execute them.
speak for yourself.
one last time.
who do you work for?
You'll...never...know.
any deeper, and I would have cut your celiac artery.
you got about 20 minutes before you bleed to death.
you can keep coming after me, or you can get to the hospital.
I wonder if your employers would have showed you that kind of mercy.
how's it going?
fine, just tired, you know? Long day.
uh, I was thinking about what we could do with Taylor.
maybe we can go to the botanical garden saturday.
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.
maybe it is too soon, you know?
sure. - Cool.
Hey, Carter, if you need to talk to me-- I just need time.
that's it, Cal.
you take as long as you need.
I'm not going anywhere.
Hey, sarge. You have a second?
Carter, he's got a weapon!
are you okay?
guess you didn't miss all the fun after all.
Colonel's career is over.
next stop, the Hague.
I'll have what he's having.
what was your business here anyway?
well, let's just say the convention wasn't as boring as I thought it would be.
the things people try to get away with in hotels.
I see you boys made the news.
not too bad, considering you also helped to take down an escort ring.
they'd barely gotten the floor manager into handcuffs before he confessed to the entire operation.
meanwhile, my phone hasn't let up.
Councilmen needing to know that their names aren't gonna surface on the client list.
I appreciate the work.
and to make sure this place is run properly, Harold here bought the hotel.
it needed proper management.
John, Harold, this one's on the house.
ms. Brozi, I was hoping we could go over the event calendar for the month.
Absolutely.
ever consider doing in-house work?
this place could use someone in crisis management.
I like to move around.
more a freelancer, like you.
it's a nice place.
maybe I'll even stick around for one more night.
well, I heard it was all booked, but then again, you do know the owner.
the penthouse suite.
another round?
sir, I have Mr. Hersh for you.
thank you, Ms. May.
well, you haven't checked in for a while.
I hit a snag.
we have a bigger problem at home.
I need you here a. S.A. P. - I'm on my way.
ms. May, I need to draft a letter to the state department.
be right in, sir.
for your state dinner at the White House.
also, I picked up something for your anniversary.
God, I completely forgot.
ms. May, you've only worked for me for two months, and already, you know me better than I know myself.
that's what I'm here for.
ready when you are, sir.
to the Secretary of State, from office of special counsel.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
he's been asking too many questions.
how do we deal with it?
seems to me we have the solution at hand.
listen, you've got the wrong guy.
you just need to
Danke schon.
I'm sorry, I don't speak German.
no, I-I think it's just a misunderstanding.
are these men bothering you?
I'd be happy to detain them.
Oh, no. Thank you. Um, I think it's just a mistake.
listen, I'm in a bit of a hurry.
I am sorry
any sign of our guy Bekhti?
no.
and I just had to shoot our best chance of finding him.
I can't take you anywhere, Shaw.
well, he was calling Bekhti. I got a partial number.
eight digits.
couldn't you have shot him after he finished dialing?
run it down, all right?
whatever Bekhti's into, these guys were willing to kill a cop to protect it.
Bekhti's cell phone signal is right below us.
40, maybe 50 feet above the street.
probably the top floor.
here we go!
all right.
wrong apartment.
go fish.
all right, we got a winner.
Ahnaz.
you disappoint me.
look at you, you got semtex. You have a cell phone detonator.
let me see that.
and cesium.
half a pound. They're making a dirty bomb.
what's the plan?
there's no time.
I'm calling Control.
Yeah, this is Catalyst. Passphrase "Indigo." - Go ahead, Indigo.
request permission to engage.
direct action.
green light.
they still have the windows closed?
as far as I can tell.
you know the only other people crazy enough to use the gas besides you, Shaw?
Russians.
crazy FSB Russians.
where do you think I get it?
we have our first winner.
number two.
there's three.
I've removed the cesium.
Shaw, what happened?
a little help, Cole.
I can't, uh-- I can't see him. Just
what do you have?
still looking.
I don't see him, Shaw.
I-I still don't have him.
calm down.
give me something I can use.
okay, wait.
don't move.
your 3: 00...
now.
Sam, you okay?
pull the fire alarm and head down to the street.
um, what are you gonna be doing?
getting my bullets back.
we were never here, remember?
Bekhti's wiring was a bit rough.
I fixed it for them.
that's nice of you.
you're making your own way out.
sure you don't want some company?
why, you know anybody?
I'll see you when I see you.
I'll see you tomorrow.
where?
new York City. Control called.
we got another number.
I guess it's like you said.
they never stop coming.
how is New York? - Cold.
I'm meeting with Wilson tonight.
since when do you make deliveries?
I was in town for a meeting.
thought I'd congratulate my best operator.
tell me this.
don't we pay you to disarm bombs rather than set them off?
my call. We had the cesium.
seemed like the best way to cover our tracks.
thank you.
unofficially.
your new number.
I've still got eyes on our new number.
he's been walking in circles for an hour, Cole. I'm getting a little bored.
tell me a story.
did four in the corps.
a dishonorable discharge.
graduates to the militia movement.
and then a week ago, he gets wired 10k from an offshore account, and moves to Queens.
I'm guessing research doesn't think he's here for a Broadway show.
Cole, I think I've been made.
my 3: 00, good-looking guy in a suit.
you sure he's not just checking you out?
forgot your gas mask, Shaw.
all right, false alarm.
incoming.
Mercer's getting a call.
it's time.
tomorrow's the big day.
we need to get a look at this guy's computer tonight.
you may even have to get out of the van.
is something wrong with you?
you're not still pining for that girl in Staad.
you ever wonder where Research gets the numbers?
no. - Why?
because I don't work for Research.
did you ever think they could be wrong sometimes?
like that guy in San Jose. Aquino. Two years ago.
he was... so confused.
you remember what he said? - I do.
because... I'm the one that killed him while you just watched on your little camera.
I also remember...
that he was trying to sell designs for a nuclear centrifuge to Hezbollah.
and you tracked the money trail.
research was right about Aquino.
like they're always right.
how can you be so sure that they are never wrong if you have no idea who they even are...
or where they get these numbers?
I know exactly where they get those damn numbers from, Cole, and so do you.
from a dark room somewhere where they hurt people badly.
and the reason we don't ask where Research gets its numbers from is because Research is never wrong.
well, they were this time.
you did something stupid, didn't you?
I called on one of my friends from the agency, asked her to trace the money.
those transfers didn't come from Hezbollah.
they came from the US Government.
aquino was doing something covert, but he was doing it for us.
I called Control. Wilson.
I mean, I've requested an internal investigation.
I will keep you out of it, I promise.
you talked to Wilson?
Yeah.
Mercer's on the move.
and we still have a job to do... remember?
whoa, all right. I'm in.
that was easy.
anything?
this is not right.
Mercer's got a bunch of emails from some contacts-- ex-military.
do you have the name of the contacts?
Yeah.
they're us.
our names are all over these files.
we need to move. Now.
Ah, that's gonna be tough.
all right, come on.
I'm sorry. - No, no, no, don't talk.
all right.
look, I'm gonna call Control, and, uh...
we're gonna get you some help.
I was trying to get your back.
always trying to be the hero, huh?
no. Just yours.
second Team, head in.
Shaw... listen.
my name is John. I'm here to help you.
team Three, move into position.
this is Team Two.
I think she may have backup.
there's some other guy in he
all teams, check in. Did you kill the woman or not?
yes?
we got a problem.
I lost her.
I would say that's a little more than a problem, Wilson.
we took care of Cole.
Shaw managed to shoot her way out.
I lost a full team.
it's a bit of a mess.
that's... unfortunate.
just a moment.
that's everything you need for your 10: 00 AM with State.
will you need anything else?
no, thank you, Miss May.
have a nice evening. - You too, sir.
so you're telling me we've got a lethal operative off the leash who's aware we terminated her partner and tried to do the same to her and who may have information which endangers our entire project.
that seems to be the situation, sir.
first, she'll be looking to regroup.
transportation, weapons, a place to hide.
but we may have an edge. - What's that?
I'm pretty sure I clipped her.
what you need tonight, girl?
you know, I just need a little bit of daylight.
sunshine.
I got you.
hold on!
if your dumb ass is here, who the hell is out on the corner?
you ever have a staring contest with a fish?
what? - No eyelids.
kinda pointless, right?
like you reaching for that scattergun.
back up.
okay, there, Lewis.
I'm gonna need you to ziptie your friend to the radiator. Nice and tight.
uh, Lewis, I'm gonna need some things.
painkillers, razor blades, and if... there's no gauze, then towels.
hollow point.
son of a bitch!
seen shots like that before.
you're gut shot.
you're done. - You better hope not.
cause if I start to lose consciousness, I'm shooting you first.
sit down, Lewis.
have you done this before?
you're pretty good at it.
I was in med school for a bit.
you're a doctor? - No.
joined the Marines.
figured I was better at killing people than fixing them.
Yeah.
I'm about to lose consciousness, so, uh...
I need you to ziptie yourself along with your friend, okay?
I always knew you was an idiot, Lewis.
Hey, you.
nice piece.
who the hell you supposed to be, some kinda badass?
not really.
I have what's called an Axis II Personality Disorder.
what's that supposed to mean?
it means when I kill you and your friends, I'm not really gonna feel anything.
you gonna kill me?
you weight what, hundred pounds?
9mm round weighs about a quarter of an ounce.
it gets the job done.
but your gun's a . 45, little girl.
I was talking about my backup piece.
Lewis, go.
if you tell anybody about me...
I will find you.
Shaw is one of our best.
trained her myself.
you're not gonna find her until she wants to be found.
we need to know her game plan.
is Shaw going to look into the Aquino situation, or simply come after us for revenge?
both.
she's a multitasker. It's why we hired her.
we need to track down Cole's contact in the CIA.
I'm already on it.
her name is Veronica Sinclair.
what did you find, partner?
Hello?
Hello, Veronica. I wanna talk to you about Michael Cole.
who is this?
whatever you told him... may have gotten him killed.
please. I can't be involved in this.
well, you either meet me or I track you down.
and that is not something that you want.
Manhattan, the Suffolk Hotel, room 1458, 5:00 PM tomorrow.
I'll be there.
figured you'd be calling me sooner or later.
you should really come in, Sam.
you know there's no point in running from us.
I'll turn myself in, but only to the boss.
I wanna meet Control. - Yeah, I don't think so.
I call my boss, you try to kill him.
it's very embarrassing for me.
I will send you the location.
you make sure he's there, or else I go public with the Aquino files.
when? - Tonight.
and, Wilson, don't keep me waiting.
Hello, Veronica. - Come in.
any chance you were followed?
I don't think so, but...
I haven't been in the field since I was at the farm.
you're Sam, right?
michael talked about you.
I mean, he didn't tell me about what you guys do or anything, but... he liked you.
what happened to him?
he was killed.
on a mission.
the less you know about all of this, the safer you'll be.
but I do need to know what he talked to you about.
Mike sent over details of wire transfers to a nuclear engineer named Daniel Aquino.
they appeared to originate out of accounts affiliated with Hezbollah, but...
someone had electronically spoofed the transfers.
I was able to track down the real originating accounts.
they were out of the US Government.
which part of the government?
a group out of the Pentagon called the Intelligence Support Activity.
have you heard of them?
you could say that.
up until yesterday, I worked for them.
their budget's confidential, but... it stretches back five years.
huge amounts coded to a project called Northern Lights.
what was the project?
I don't know.
but Aquino was part of it.
they built a facility of some kind coded as Research.
but I can't find the names of anyone else involved in the project.
Mike said Aquino told you the name of his contact in Northern Lights.
do you remember it?
stay here.
and keep away from those windows.
Veronica and I had a bit of a chat before you got here.
she tried really, really hard to remember anything else that could help me, but...
she didn't know anything.
I read your file, and I'm kind of a big fan.
so, I really don't wanna hurt you.
I just need the name.
you really have no idea what you're caught up in, do you?
who you're actually working for?
did you honestly think the source of the numbers was Guantanamo?
some sad taxi driver rotting away in a cage somewhere?
I mean, you should know torture almost never produces good information.
well... almost never.
sadly, we are on a bit of a clock.
Wilson's men started looking for Veronica here three hours ago.
now...
aquino was hired to build a home for something very special, something I wanna find.
so you're gonna tell me the name of his contact.
one of the things I left out of my file...
I kind of enjoy this sort of thing.
I am so glad you said that.
I do too.
and just when we were starting to really connect.
I'm sorry.
a little rude, I know.
we'll do this again soon.
clear! - All clear.
indigo located.
and the secondary.
instructions?
understood.
can you do me a favor?
can you not shoot me this time?
give me a good reason. - I don't know.
I'm a really nice person, and, well... that.
may I?
okay.
it's probably acontine.
you can counteract it with atropine... in case I bump it.
the dose we use, you've got about four minutes.
so unless you've got some atropine on you, don't bump it.
I got a friend who wants to talk to you.
why would I wanna talk to one of your friends?
you got somewhere better to be?
Hello, Ms. Shaw.
you can call me Harold.
you're the man in charge?
no. No one's in charge.
my friend and I help people in trouble.
or maybe you work for Wilson and this is all some kinda game.
honestly, I was never terribly good at games.
you work-- or at least you used to work
for a secret government program that prevents terrible things
terrorist acts and crimes relevant to nation security.
the information that you received came from a group of people that you call Research.
and it's notable for two reasons. One, it's never wrong.
and two, it consists only of a number.
this is-- - Your number.
and Mr. Cole's.
we were unable to save him, and for that, I'm sorry.
we didn't understand the exact nature of your situation at first.
so if you're not part of the program... then who are you?
let's just say that ultimately, you and I work for the same entity.
and that entity wanted you and your friend over there to help me?
in a manner of speaking.
in truth, we're probably the only people who can help you.
well, if you know so much about my employers, then you must know that they are very...
very good at finding people.
even you can't run forever.
I don't need forever.
just long enough to find the man behind the curtain, the one who gave the kill order.
you won't even scratch the surface of their organization, and you'll still be in grave danger.
you hold a piece of a puzzle, a secret so important that they were willing to kill
Dr. Aquino and your friend Michael Cole and yourself to protect it.
the truth about a group of people you call Research.
something that Cole had begun to suspect.
which is what? - That they don't exist.
the world looks like it did ten years ago, but underneath, it's become very strange indeed.
an invisible struggle has begun.
most of the people who knew this are already dead.
all things being equal, I prefer you didn't join them.
so like I said... We're here to help you.
but first, you need to stop running because you're much too good it and we can't keep up.
hiding isn't my style. - But dying is?
because, as I see it, that's your only option.
you know, I never had many friends.
didn't have much use for 'em.
Cole was an exception.
and he deserved better.
a word of advice for what it's worth.
set out to correct the world's wrongs and you'll almost certainly wind up adding to them.
my number, in case you change your mind.
Thanks.
but no thanks.
it's time to end this. Tonight.
get a team ready. - Yes, sir.
you're late.
I'd ask how you knew it was me, but I guess that's what we pay you for
picking the right person out of a crowd.
of course I wanted to meet Control.
and you're not Control, now, are you?
sadly, no.
but I'm as close as you're gonna get.
you'd really put the program in jeopardy just to avenge your partner?
I assumed a woman like you would have a more sophisticated world view.
you people hired me because I don't care about most people.
and then you went and killed the one person that I actually liked.
fair enough.
of course, you weren't supposed to be around to carry a grudge.
you wanted to meet.
was it to find out why I let Wilson target you and your partner?
or just to kill me?
either way, we should go somewhere more private.
you probably think I made a devil's bargain.
and maybe I have.
but the program is the reason we haven't had another major attack.
if the public knew about what we do, we'd lose that ability.
and Aquino?
again, a regrettable decision, but a necessary one.
no one life is above the safety of millions of Americans.
that's the ugly math that I have to deal with every day.
you of all people should understand that.
I do.
and if I were in your place, I'd do the exact same thing.
I may not be in the program anymore, but I
I still understand how important it is.
then why the cloak and dagger?
Cole's research on the Aquino case.
I wanted to give it to you personally.
why not give it to Wilson?
you can't hire people like Cole and expect them to act like sheep.
now, I know how to follow orders.
but Cole was just brilliant, and he believed in the cause.
and Wilson knew that.
you know, you could've warned him.
or even me. But instead, you placed a kill order like we were some kinda problem to be solved.
your partner broke the rules.
you're on the hook for that as much as he was.
and then you screwed that up in such a spectacular fashion.
how could I trust this idiot with something so important?
Hersh was right.
you are a good soldier.
you didn't want revenge.
you wanted to protect the program.
a good soldier does both.
let her go.
let's clean this up.
you were a good operator.
sorry, Shaw.
lady just passed out in the street, unresponsive to CPR.
EMT's called it as soon as they arrived.
so this looks like a homicide to you?
sure. Woman her age, not a mark on her.
I thought it suspicious.
can't expect the task force to show up.
we were in the neighborhood, Officer Fleming.
Yeah, we're probably looking at an overdose or cardiac arrest.
Yeah, but, I mean, just to make sure, we ought to -
why don't you grab yourself a coffee? We got this, okay?
thanks for your help.
it's a full moon.
coroner's Office is swamped.
you mind getting her downtown?
whatever you say, Detective.
Hey, uh, little help here?
she may be hot, but that's one broad I never wanna see again.
I mean, ever!
you guys never told me she was dangerous and crazy!
bad combo.
what happened?
I gave her the atropine and some demerol to knock her out.
but she woke up on the drive over and almost killed me!
look-- look at this bruise on my neck.
so I gave her some more.
how much more, Mr. Tao?
I don't know.
I look like a doctor to you?
man.
I so don't get paid enough for this crap.
we don't pay you anything, Leon.
I'm gonna widen the distance, fellas.
you take your chances.
dying can make you thirsty.
for guardian angels, you two were a bit late to the party.
your employers wanted you dead.
so now you are.
I guess Leon forgot the instructions about patting you down.
ms. Shaw, we're on your side.
I feel like we've proven that you can trust us.
trust is overrated.
toss me your phones.
like I said before...
just in case you change your mind.
well, she certainly makes an impression.
do you think she'll call us a taxi?
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
new YORK
Manhattan
the storm warning is for the coastal areas of Nassau and Suffolk counties, including east and south Hampton and Owen Island.
heavy rains and destructive winds will continue into the night.
residents are advised to prepare for evacuation.
isn't this service vest a little unethical?
I am handi-capable, MR. Reese, but I need some assistance.
we don't want to exclude bear from our rainy day activities.
we should have seen once upon a time In The West.
any word from our dearly departed Agent Shaw?
not a whisper.
what worries me more at the moment is that we haven't heard anything from the machine recently either.
Yes,I've noticed. Three days. No numbers.
maybe we're finally cleaning up the streets.
as much as I'd like that,I have to wonder if it hasn't got something to do with the actually departed Kara Stanton.
the virus that she uploaded during the time you spent in your bomb vest could easily have spread from the department of defense.systems, all the way to the machine.
you built the machine, Finch.
can't you access it?
you know, check under the hood?
I sealed it for a reason, MR. Reese.
I'm afraid you're going to have to wait and see what Stanton's employers have in mind for the future.
maybe your machine really is on the fritz.
has this ever happened before,Finch?
it's a precedent.
it gave us all six numbers at once?
spread out across the country like this.
very worrisome.
stranger yet,I can find no solid connection between them.
maybe they're plotting something together.
or someone's plotting against them.
I wondered that.
three of the six numbers are listed on the NCIC missing persons database.
two of the others dropped off the grid entirely.
no digital footprint at all.
people with something to hide or hiding from something.
and there's one local.
he's an antiques dealer in Brooklyn.
he hasn't been reported missing yet.
that could be the next target.
I'll go say hi.
I'll enlist carter's help looking into the other five.
and I'll keep an eye on the machine's erratic behavior.
looks like Rollins runs his shop out of his apartment, Finch.
there's no answer, so I'm going to let myself in.
Rollins' taste in antiques is exotic.
no sign of the man himself.
but someone was already here and went to a lot of effort to dig up a bill for a rental property out on Owen Island.
I found the account for Jack Rollins' visa.
payments on the beach property and a train ticket to Suffolk county, all in the last 24 hours.
Rollins was in a hurry to get out of the city.
and we're not the only ones looking for him.
heading out in a storm like this?
Rollins is running from something.
I'll find out what's on owen island.
Mr. Reese, is that a good idea?
storm or no,Finch, if Rollins is our one lead, i'm headed to the beach.
next time you need a favor, can we wait till after the monsoon season?
thanks for your help, Moss.
these files seem a little thin.
because the cases are then.
dozens of reasons people step off the grid.
bad credit, old rap sheet.
I mean, hell, sometimes people just disappear, detective.
first person to go missing was a French student studying abroad at Stanford, seven years ago.
Post-collegiate wanderlust. Wouldn't be the first. What's your interest?
what's the name at the bottom of that file?
it's on the others too.
desk jockey at our CCSR branch.
handles cybercrimes, identity theft, mostly white collar stuff.
looks like he files one hell of a report.
Yeah, he has a lot of notes.
seems like he's on to something.
if you want,I can give him a call.
see what he's-- No, that's okay.
I can handle the follow-up.
Well,I'm gonna beat the rain home.
okay.
agent Moss?
I've been doing this job a long time.
heh, probably too long.
all that business about Cal Beecher,What do you know?
been doing my job for a long time too.
and not having those iab files,I can only surmise, but the kind of red flags they put up, Beecher is bad news.
steer clear,Carter.
this is special Agent Fahey.
this is detective Carter of the NYPD.
I've been looking through some missing person files that have your notes on them.
the cases were connected through one potential M.O. something about missing or destroyed photos you uncovered at more than one potential crime scene.
have you been able to chase down any new leads on that M.O?
I work out of headquarters in DC, detective.
I don't chase leads.
I write reports... That no one reads.
right. But i might have a new informant with additional information for this case.
Well,I put all that information together months ago.
I called the NYPD at the time.
no one there was helpful. No one had anything to add.
now something suddenly just popped up?
it's a confidential source.
confidential from the FBI?
nice try.
call the bureau liaison if you have any new information, otherwise have a nice day.
they're evacuating the island,Finch.
but I made it out to Rollins' rental house.
where are you?
Well,I'm back at Rollins' in Brooklyn.
bumping around in the dark.
storm knocked out a transformer down on the street and all power within a nine-block radius.
why go back there?
detective Carter spoke with an FBI agent who's discovered a pattern in the crimes.
there were no photographs of the missing persons at their homes.
so I'm looking for photos, or a lack thereof.
what's this?
basement storage.
I'm gonna take a look downstairs, bear.
nothing to worry about.
empty photo frames.
just like the others.
Mr.Reese,I've found something interesting in Rollins' basement.
Finch,I didn't copy.
I'm not alone.
bear?
what are you doing?
what is it?
Mr.Reese,I think I know what happened to all those missing people.
FBI, don't move. Hands up. I want to see some ID.
well, which is it?
you want my hands up, or you want to see ID?
Jennings U.S. Marshals service.
I'm trying to locate someone, a guy named Rollins.
got some questions for him.
you looking for Rollins? Me too. I believe he's connected to--to another missing persons case.
we believe a wanted fugitive may be looking for Rollins.
is he here?
I don't know. I just started looking.
well, why don't we take our weapons off each other and clear this house?
trail was hot on Rollins, but no one at hq would get off their hands, follow up the lead.
so I decided to come out here myself.
you out here all alone?
well, it's been a few years since Quantico, but I remember a thing or two about working in the field.
well, you're on the right trail.
Rollins was here recently, he couldn't have gotten far in this storm.
my car is outside.
why don't we head to the local police station? We're gonna need a few more guys on this.
someone tried to destroy these teeth.
but the flame wasn't hot enough to burn enamel.
it could take some time, but... If the vic's dentals are on file, we could get an ID.
no, we can't wait that long.
assuming that the teeth belong to Jack Rollins, he was likely dead when they were removed.
one would hope so, anyway.
well, whoever did this knows how to get rid of a body.
they didn't just want to kill Rollins, they wanted him to disappear.
we may be looking at more than a string of missing persons.
we may be looking at a string of murders.
six victims.
if our killer can assume these identities, then he would be a composite of all these missing persons in more ways than one.
we're looking at a serial killer.
Finch, what are you doing?
Mr.Reese is out on an island looking for a man violent enough to pull out another man's teeth.
and now I can't warn him.
I have to get there myself.
I'm pretty sure all the roads are closed now.
how do you think you're gonna get out there?
think I'll use my pilot's license.
I got a nor'easter touching down right now.
I've got a population of 357 souls I've got to get off this island before I can't anymore.
chief of police is running the evacuation on the mainland.
I'm the law left in the town with half its ass underwater.
this is a matter of federal importance.
we're looking for this man.
don't recognize him.
but if he was a renter, he's probably been evacuated.
chief?
chief, come in.
mind if we at least make a few phone calls while we're here?
sure. If the cell and land lines weren't down, the power wasn't out, and the emergency radio didn't pick today to crap out on me.
anything else? - Yeah.
how's your coffee?
Hey, gents, you may have jurisdiction and authority here, but one thing you don't have is my cooperation.
for now, mother nature takes priority.
look, marshal, we can't afford to sit around here with or without the deputy's help.
I don't think we're on the trail of just a missing person here.
I think Rollins is dead, and he may not be the only one.
I think we're on the trail of a cold-blooded killer.
you didn't want to share this earlier?
well, I didn't know all the facts.
technically, it's still just a theory.
tell me, what do you know about making a body disappear?
this place is a ghost town.
Yeah. Our uni's are out on storm patrol.
what brings you down here?
you. I would have called, but you're not answering those, are you?
so I decided to drop by, and maybe you could tell me what I did wrong.
Cal, I'm working on something.
I'll talk when I can.
I guess I'll check in later.
so how'd you get stuck on the island?
we got water in the muffler and the engine died, so we came here-- Carly and I.
that's my new bride Carly over there.
we just got married.
we're both dental hygienists. Did I say that?
Yes.
what did you mean earlier when you said Rollins wasn't the only one?
I think we're on the trail of several crimes.
I'm looking at multiple murders across multiple states.
the killer must have taken the identity of his victim before moving on.
I followed the trail back to that student at stanford, then I worked forward.
it turns out every victim of the killer moved cities within 18 months of vanishing.
Rollins moved to New York.
so I went to New York, found the rental bill.
followed him out here to Owen Island.
whoever was traveling as Rollins could easily still be on this island.
Erica, we just lost the bridge.
when did this happen,Stan?
a few minutes ago.
I locked up the bar,I saw Becky finishing the boards on the A&P.
we high-tailed it down to the bridge just in time to see it go under.
no crossing it until the tides go down.
and who's this guy?
I picked a bad day to check up on my hotel.
so you're the guy building that hotel?
on my drier days.
we're 90 days out on that property.
if it washes away...-- there's more.
on the way here, we saw someone. Down by the docks.
did it look like it was trying to get off the island?
looked like he was prepping a boat for himself.
we have to get down there.
I've now got five stranded people and no way off this rock, this is where I need to be.
absolutely, deputy.
so we'll go and bring him back here for you.
special kind of man ricks his life in this weather for a few crustaceans.
whoa, fellas, I'm just a fisherman.
there's a lot of money in this haul.
I didn't know I was breaking a law.
you have ID?
don't get asked for it on the water.
what's your name?
Well,Ethan, you're on land now.
who's with you? - No one.
I know you're there.
I've got 15 shots here.
think it over.
no need for shooting!
I was just looking to get away from this storm is all!
you from the island?
No,I was looking for some work on the boats.
got stuck out here by the storm, thought I'd ride it out.
let's get them both back to the station.
I don't care who you are, you can't endanger my citizens by landing your cessna in the middle of my town.
that actually a De Havilland beaver.
what's going on here?
this amateur storm chaser harold gull is under arrest.
he landed his float plane in the town square.
I needed a stretch of water to land and there was, well, water everywhere.
and what's all this?
my meteorological equipment.
I've been a certified member of the national storm chasers and spotters association for over ten years.
deputy, despite this man's recklessness, could you book him with endangering our lives after the storm?
we have bigger things to worry about.
fine.
but when the storm ends,I'm hitting him with everything I've got.
Hey,Stan,it's getting dark out there.
you think you could put some more diesel in the gennie out back?
Yeah, sure.
the national storm chasers association,Harold?
well, it worked, didn't it?
we were wrong.
this isn't a group conspiracy.
those numbers, they're all dead.
and we're tracking their killer.
I know. I had the displeasure of seeing all that was left of the real Jack Rollins, molars and all.
some twisted mind's idea of a trophy.
what if the machine sent us all six numbers to tell us that someone had been all of those people?
what if a smart killer was interested not only in taking lives, but in taking identities.
like a chameleon.
changing into his victims, living their lives until he gets bored and moves on to the next.
to identify such a killer, we would want to consider who he has been, and what he might look like.
okay, so how do you spot someone who's that good at being anyone else?
excuse me, marshal.
that FBI guy needs to see you out back.
you need to see this.
stanley put them out. Someone used diesel to try to cook the pile.
the killer was here minutes ago.
he's close.
and he's shed the "Rollins" identity.
then he could be anyone in there.
if the killer is among these people, then he's out of his element-- he's broken his pattern.
assuming the identities of his victims, it's part of his ritual.
and now that Rollins' ID. is burned, he's trapped.
he must have taken on another identity.
and he can't go anywhere with it.
he's as stuck as we are.
why didn't the machine give us his real identity?
why play games?
I assume he's smart, and he digitally erased his original persona.
I did.
well, we need to find a way to hunt him.
we might be able to, Mr.Reese.
are you familiar with storm chasing?
what are you watching?
didn't know if you were still too busy to talk to me.
actually,I could use another set of eyes on something.
take a look.
this is a building-owned security camera in Chicago six months ago.
a missing persons I'm working.
guy named Rollins.
this is him leaving his shop, and him coming back the next day.
Oh, he moved to New York soon after.
what do you notice?
that the same guy both times?
why do you ask?
that's a close match.
but the guy locking up is left-handed, and the guy unlocking is a righty.
he's also a couple inches taller. - Exactly.
what are you looking at here?
some kind of elaborate robbery?
something much worse.
so let me get this straight.
you want me to conduct a series of interviews with everyone on the station and you want this guy to help?
he's the only one who arrived on this island after the bridge went out.
I know he appears a little strange, but he does have some interesting equipment in those bags.
Yeah, well, unless he has a fingerprint scanner and the vicap database, what does he have that we need?
Agent...Fahey, is it?
are you familiar with the instantel seismograph?
body armor?
I don't think we'll be taking too much heavy fire with this group.
Look,Jennings,I spend most of my nine-to-five tethered to a desk.
I've questioned a few embezzlers and some identity thieves.
we're about to walk into a room with a killer.
and I'll be standing right behind you.
thank you, Mr.Amis.
I'm with the FBI,looking for a missing person on the island here.
I'd like to ask you a standard series of questions, and I'd appreciate your cooperation.
okay, so ask.
this is Jack Rollins.
I'm trying to establish who had contact with him on the island recently.
I don't recognize him.
we don't get too many tourists this time of the year, but I would have seen him at the store.
who do you recognize at the station tonight,Becky?
I've known stanley most of my life.
who don't you recognize?
that honeymoon couple for one.
and where did you two meet?
we met in Albany.
why didn't you evacuate earlier?
I told you, i've got a few thousand bucks crawling around in those traps you made me leave down on the docks.
so you disregarded a state of emergency?
I had to preserve my catch.
you often pull in traps all by yourself?
how's it going? - Good.
see all these tiny waves?
they're called microseisms, and all these little bumps are the heartbeat.
the needle picks it up like it would a tectonic shift, and it's picking up a lot.
and everyone else?
I'm getting clean readings.
the metal in the table amplifies it.
everyone is steady.
stanley the bar owner is a little below average, but I think there might be something wrong with him.
no, I just think his blood alcohol level could start a lawn mower.
but that fisherman in there?
he's nervous about something.
I know Ethan Mattson.
he's lived on Owen for five years.
he gets into some trouble, but he's good on the boats.
do you wanna know who I don't recognize?
half of Owen knows cunningham properties, but I can't say I've ever said "hi" to his face.
and that drifter?
I mean, who comes to an island in winter looking for seasonal work?
Ms.Winter, how long have you been the dean of student affairs at stanford?
10...no,11 years.
I'm wondering if you could shed light on a former student who went missing.
he graduated...in 2005.
I remember Henri.
he was an international student.
he went missing right after he graduated.
police called for weeks.
inspectors from France, even interpol.
there was a digital trail on the boy in San Diego, 18 months after graduating.
just as we told the authorities then, Henri never left a forwarding address.
we often lose touch with recent alumni until they settle down somewhere.
so the last time Henri was seen was on campus.
he lived in student housing. Did he have a roommate?
Yes. His last year, it was a student named Alex Declan.
it says here...huh.
what?
I just see a note on Henri's housing form.
he requested a new roommate his last semester.
the last semester of his senior year?
does that happen often?
not usually. Most seniors have a million other things on their mind.
but the matter seems to have been resolved.
do you have any records on Declan?
that's strange.
Declan is listed in housing as henri's roommate, but I can't find his registration.
no student photo either.
something must have fallen through the cracks.
Dennis, you're such a busy guy.
you don't get out to the island very often.
I don't babysit my properties.
but the hotel out here was days behind schedule.
you think I want to slog around this sandpit in the rain?
Victor, you don't have an ID.
you don't have a solid alibi for being here on the island and, last of all, for being down at the boatyard.
I told you. I was passing through.
recognize this?
it's yours.
you've got a lot of D-rings.
kind of weird.
unless you're a climber, or... In the military.
do you have a heart problem?
because right now, yours is really pumping.
Owen Island station, this is detective Joss Carter.
eighth precinct,New York city, calling on the emergency police frequency.
do you read me? Over.
this is deputy Schmidt of the Owen Island PD.
who is this?
detective Carter from New York city.
I have new information for the U.S. Marshal on your island.
I need to speak to him immediately.
who is it?
some detective from the city got through, said her name was carpenter--carter-- ugh!
the generator.
do you read me? Over.
Oh, my god. Is she--is she dead?
you shouldn't go out there.
the storm's pretty bad.
I'm following up on a lead, it's urgent.
I need to get to Owen Island.
Whoa,I can't let you do that.
I don't care what lead it is.
I'm going,Kyle.
I won't say it again.
Okay...but I'm driving.
what's going on here? First you question us, and now this?
you...you were helping them.
what were they doing in there, really?
they asked to use my equipment for police business.
they were looking for liars in the group.
talking about finding a killer.
Becky, what did they ask you?
they asked me who I recognized here.
so who don't you recognize?
everyone please settle down.
you're building a hotel on the other side of the island.
nobody even knows your face.
I have hundreds of business contacts in the city.
call any of them.
and what good did that do,Harold?
behavior analysis,John. Just give it a minute.
what about you, Mr.Newlywed?
nobody knows your face.
wait a second,I know his face.
everybody, we're forgetting, she was killed with a knife.
so whose knife was it?
I know whose it is.
that knife? It's called a Ka-Bar.
not exactly something you pick up at a local bait and tackle.
I didn't hurt anybody.
you need to be a special kind of person to carry a weapon like that.
let me go.
that's what I thought.
I was lying.
okay?
God help me,I was lying.
but I'm not a killer.
no. You're a marine.
the knife. The tattoo. The D-rings clipped to your bag.
you're on the run.
24th meu out of camp Lejeune.
second tour.
I couldn't go back.
I wanted to get a boat to Canada.I got stuck here.
so who else knew you had that knife?
I don't know.
I mean,I came into the station with the fisherman.
wait, where is the fisherman?
he must have slipped out.
I'll go after him.
if I don't come back, get these people to safety.
so... Do you think we can cross the entire state before you say a word to me?
what do you want to talk about?
I can think of some things.
like how an NYPD detective got aced out of the FBI because she keeps bad company, how about that?
what are you talking about, the FBI?
not a friend of internal affairs,huh,Cal?
Joss,I'm in narcotics.
we get pulled in by IAB half-a-dozen times a year.
my neck of the woods don't mean a thing.
it does to me.
makes me wonder about the man I trusted.
Oh, what, you don't trust me?
you think I'm dirty?
that I'm on the take? Is that what you think?
I don't know what to think,Cal. - Yo, what did they tell you about me?
Beecher! Slow down!
you serious?
what, you think I'd hurt you?
I don't know.
but I don't want to hurt you.
marijuana.
this is what you were trying to protect from the storm.
Oh, no, that couldn't be.
unbelievable.
we're hunting a killer, and instead we get amateur drug night in the sticks.
you smuggle it in on your boat?
Ah, don't say anything.
just bleed if I'm right.
Ordinarily,I'd make sure you went behind bars.
but I got bigger fish to fry.
so you go in the trunk.
what gave me away?
how did you know?
the needle spiked in between the interviews.
when I wasn't watching.
when you were resting on the table.
you should keep an eye on that heart rate.
I knew you were too good at those interrogations.
who are you really?
I could ask you the same thing.
you're taller than I would have thought.
and you cut your hair.
and you bought every minute of the dedicated "Agent Fahey."
Yes, quite the performance.
make a sound,I start hurting innocents.
let's take a walk.
I thought a bit more privacy would do us some good.
you know, the walls are closing in.
you have no place to run.
it's over.
it's over for Fahey, sure.
just like it was over for Rollins.
was that before or after you tore teeth out of his head and threw them in a furnace?
damn things never burn.Sloppy,I know.
but when the FBI's knocking on your door, you have to move faster than you should.
other agents will come looking.
like the last one?
federal agents always work in pairs.
but this hard-ass showed up solo in a stupid blue windbreaker, knocking on my door, looking for Rollins.
he talked to me.
seemed nervous.
a little out of his element.
right then I knew I had him beat.
he left me no choice. I had to kill him.
then I realized my only way off this island was to become him.
then this damn storm hits,and some cowboy U.S. Marshal comes knocking.
I was stuck as special agent fahey, so I improvised.
and the deputy. Why harm her?
Well,I couldn't be sure what she heard off the radio.
you always have to be ready to improvise.
honestly, the question isn't who I am.
it's who you are.
I watched you all night.
see, I can always spot an impostor.
I spotted you.
are you like me?
you have no idea.
you're an amateur at this.
not the way I planned it, man.
I don't hurt people.
and I didn't kill the FBI guy in that trunk.
but you're in the way, so you go in the drink.
don't worry.
as cold as this water is, it'll be quick.
Hey,Ethan.
as quick as that?
now that fahey won't get far,I think the mysterious Mr.Gull might be my next great challenge.
you'll never get off the island.
by morning they'll come here looking for the real Alan Fahey.
and they'll find him... In the trunk of his car.
and what about you? - And what about you? And what about you?
and what about... You?
you asked the question and you're the answer. Your plane.
you're gonna fly me out of here.
you haven't outlived your usefulness.
you could never be me because I save lives.
you take them.
No,I live those lives better than real people ever could.
I follow them and watch them waste what they have.
I do those identities justice.
the things I've seen.
the lives I've lived.
one day I'll stop, when I find the person I'm meant to be.
what?
people like you don't stop.
you can rationalize it however you like.
but you hurt people because you like it.
because you're sick!
you're maladjusted and you need help.
on second thought, maybe I'll find another way off this island.
I'll miss finding out more about you.
if there's anything left to tell,I'll make it up as I go along.
don't worry,I'm good at that.
just like you.
you all right,Harold?
detective?
you have impeccable timing.
how did you get here?
I hitched a ride with the coast guard.
and some very unpleasant people inside said they thought they saw you come this way.
so is that him, our identity killer?
he was pretending to be an FBI agent.
he was really rather good at it.
he had a badge and a gun and a...-- and what?
body armor.
what are you doing?
it's a police station.
there's bound to be one of these around here somewhere.
Hey, listen...
I don't know what happened last night between us, but, uh,I'm wondering what happens today.
I don't know what happens.
but I'm glad you were here.
a drug smuggler shot at me with a spear gun last night.
is that a first for you?
wish I could say yes.
glad you made it back, Mr.Reese.
I am too.
and I'm glad the machine was right.
how so?
it was smart enough to tell us about a killer with multiple identities.
it may be true that the six numbers were not a glitch, but the three days of silence preceding it were.
if the machine had been working properly, we might have gotten a number for the real Alan Fahey and saved him.
instead, an FBI agent is dead.
but I wish I knew what that means for the future.
at least the storm is passing.
no, Mr.Reese,I have a feeling that it's just beginning.
stay tuned for scenes from our next episode.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considers these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you will never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
Justin Lee is dead, sir.
and now that executive has started digging into the accident.
knowing her, she won't stop.
then see to it that she does.
interesting strategy,Mr.Elias. Care to explain?
trying to learn how to win at a disadvantage.
I assume we're talking about more than just chess.
rook and knight, valuable pieces.
the assistant district attorney and detective Szymanski.
their deaths benefited your enemy,Peter Yogorov.
that's very good,Harold.
and I'm in touch enough to know that a number of your associates inside have recently been transferred elsewhere.
who are you playing against?
the russians? HR?
a ghost.
someone I'd very much like to identify.
from the board,I'd say the outcome is a foregone conclusion.
don't count me out just yet,Harold.
I might have a few moves left.
give John my best.
miss me already, Finch?
it's not a social call,Mr.Reese.
I want to inform you we have a new number.
I'll head back.
no, you're tracking a number too, albeit a prior one.
stay the course.
so who's up this time?
Monica Jacobs, senior VP of strategy and systems for rylatech, one of the top networking companies in America.
and the security is tight, right down to the RFID tracking chips in the employee ID.
so how will you get close to her?
I've found an appropriate cover.
she's certainly a rising star in the tech world.
gushing profiles in blogs and national magazines.
not bad for a small-town girl from Indiana.
tech geeks and code monkeys. Doesn't sound too dangerous.
ms. Jacobs is a top executive in a billion-dollar business where corporate espionage is rampant.
the threat could come from anywhere.
how's my day,Jerome?
Oh, let's go with slammed.
Tovo at 10: 00, new technologies at 11: 00, and then the florist called again wanting the correct address for the Lee family.
should we just let that go?
No,I'll handle it myself.
wait... Is that the new centra-6 processor?
Yes. - I thought they weren't coming out until next quarter.
is its variable processing as nimble as they say?
Oh,I consider it a vast improvement in terms of energy consumption, overall efficiency
I knew it.
anybody who says tablet hex cores are overkill
has no idea how to fully utilize cpu architecture. I agree.
well...
it's very nice to meet you... Harold.
it. is lucky to have you.
I believe our network solutions proposal says it all.
rylatech's routers and switches have a 99. 7% reliability rating.
on the basis of what?
independent tests run alongside three of our five main competitors.
our firmware is self-upgrading.
like everyone else's, including Censatek...
who had better pastries.
look, what is your name again?
Ross Haskell, head of product development.
Ross, our VP didn't come here to listen to dry stats.
why should we use Rylatech's products?
because you already do.
we've spent the last 15 years building the backbone of the internet, and our latest components will set the standard for the next 15.
even the department of defense trusts us to get their data from point "a" to point "b.
but, if you want just one reason,Martin Baxter.
he started Rylatech in his parents' garage and built it into this.
that determination, we all have it.
we'll never stop working hard for you.
or, go with Censatek, who is known for offering kickbacks to networking execs...
along with their nice pastries.
so how did you know about those kickbacks at Censatek?
I have spies everywhere,Martin.
well, if they ever try to entice you to jump ship, give me a chance to match their offer.
I can't imagine how we'd get along without you,Monica.
well done,Ross.
Terney,I hear you're running point on the Szymanski and Ada Homicides.
Yeah. - You got any leads?
Oh, nothing solid yet, but we're pushing on all fronts.
what about the Mayor's guy who got wounded--Quinn?
all he remembers is that the shooter was wearing a mask and he ran out the back door.
keep me up to date.
just calling to check in, detective, and to say how sorry I am.
I know that detective Szymanski was a friend.
Thanks,Finch. Appreciate it.
if there's anything I can do for you...
Um,i'll let you know. Talk to you soon.
I know you don't want to talk to me.
but look, about Szymanski-- there's nothing to talk about.
unless you're ready to tell me the name of your CI. Who got him killed.
Joss...-- like I said.
you okay?
beecher got a tip about dirty money on Szymanski.
I prove the money wasn't his,Szymanski turns up dead?
I gotta know if Beecher set him up,Fusco.
I'll see what I can find out. - Okay.
good evening,Mr.Reese.
have you made contact with your quarry?
not yet.
you keeping track of yours?
Yes. Thanks to the chips in the ID. Cards,I can see the location of every employee in the building.
identify any potential threat?
so far, just overwork and the consumption of raw seafood.
ms. Jacobs is dedicated, passionate, technically astute.
you've got a crush on this number, don't you,Finch?
a human being can recognize qualities in another human being without...
she's leaving her office.
it's strange. I followed her to the R&D floor.
she's in the computer storage room.
appears to be looking for something.
like what?
I'm not sure.
why would someone in Ms.Jacobs's position be sneaking around stealing computer files and hiding from corporate security?
I know you like this woman,Finch.
but if the agency taught me one thing...
it's that the most effective spy is the one you'd never suspect.
a true believer.
Mr.Reese?
Mr.Reese, are you there? - I gotta call you back,Finch.
Hello, shaw.
I thought I just might find you here.
and you decided to drop in for a visit?
stakeouts can get a little tedious.
and what made you think I wanted the company?
the time I shot you, or the time I ditched you at the cemetery?
I'm persistent.
or maybe you just can't take a hint.
Darlene and Evan Cole.
your former partner's parents.
dead partner.
the government framed Cole as a domestic terrorist.
I thought you might come back here to set the record straight.
how'd you figure that?
it's what I'd do.
control killed their son.
they didn't need to take their memory of him.
even the CIA wouldn't stoop that low.
they'd just sweep their mess under the rug and give him a star on the wall.
your former employers killed cole for discovering the truth, and nothing's stopping them from killing his parents, too.
but you already know this.
that's why you're out here and not in there.
next time you want some fresh air...
pick a different spot.
a friend once told me, in our line of work, we walk in the dark.
doesn't mean we have to walk in it alone.
Well,I'm not sure the source of your problem is a virus.
it's more likely... Mochachino.
I'll try to find you a new keyboard. - Thank you.
now what was it you were stealing?
what are you doing in Ms.Jacobs' office?
security update.
we just had an update a week ago.
well, we've since discovered additional threats to the network that needed addressing.
and what threats might those be, specifically?
a complex kernel-mode rootkit that disables secure subsystems through compromised applets, and I'm sure I don't need to explain to you how dangerous that could be if the update were not installed.
all set.
you're welcome.
what are you thinking?
they ran out of paper towels.
I'm talking about you refusing to say who gave you the tip on the Szymanski money.
the bills were marked by the feds.
found in a raid on a bodega that elias was operating out of.
so?
money never made it to evidence.
so either Elias's boys got a hold of it or some dirty cops did.
either way, it stinks.
you saying I had something to do with it?
I'm saying Szymanski got set up.
and by you keeping quiet, makes me think you were in on it.
see,I got friends who used to work in your old precinct,Fusco.
I heard about your crew.
two are in jail and one's missing, and you're calling me dirty?
let me spell it out for you.
stay away from carter.
or what?
what's going on,Fellas?
that's a good question.
what is going on?
I can do that for you,Monica.
Oh, it's okay. I've got it.
you want me to pick you up some lunch?
No,I have a meeting.
I don't have anything scheduled.
Oh, it was a last minute thing. I didn't bother putting it on the calendar.
Mr.Reese, where are you?
on my way.
you learn what our number's up to?
I believe Ms. Jacobs is about to hand off some sensitive information.
or perhaps not. I'll patch you in.
what was so urgent I had to cancel my lunch and meet you out here?
he's one of your engineers in R&D.
Yeah, he died in an accident a little over a week ago.
it was tragic.
I discovered something concerning.
when I had flowers sent to his parents, the florist said no one by the name of Lee lived at that address.
people move, change their address.
I checked.
the parents never lived there.
it's not just that.
everything about Lee, from his contact information to his work history, was a lie.
I think he may have been a plant.
a plant? For who?
could be any of our competitors.
that's why I didn't want to have this conversation at the office.
and then, there's this.
she just gave him the flash drive that she used last night.
I found lee's computer, made copies of his files and found a handful of encrypted emails sent the day he died.
I tried, but I couldn't open them.
who else knows about this?
just you.
seeing as he worked in your division,I thought you'd want to get out in front of this.
I do. I'll look into it.
then we can tell the old man together, okay?
And,Monica... Thank you.
I need to see the emails on that drive.
I'll have to contrive a reason to get into his office.
I have a better idea.
excuse me.
nice to have you back.
thanks for meeting me,Mr.Quinn.
how's the shoulder?
it's getting stronger day by day.
you sounded concerned on the phone.
there's been some questions about the Szymanski investigation.
like, who my source was about the money.
and you said?
nothing.
you asked me to keep your name out of it, and I have.
thing is, uh,I've been wondering myself.
where did that tip come from?
well, the tip was strong.
why does it matter?
a dead detective's reputation is on the line.
it matters.
Cal, in my position i'm constantly being offered information.
and the reason people come to me is they know i will keep their confidence.
right.
uh, look... The tip came from one of Elias's soldiers.
since Elias has been in prison, his men have struggled.
this guy was just tired of seeing Szymanski getting paid while he scraped by.
now, I could have given that information to anybody, but I wanted my godson to get the credit for it.
I imagine whoever's questioned you wish they had made the bust.
don't let them rattle you.
we good? - Yeah.
Thanks,Mr.Quinn.
anytime.
he gonna be a problem?
let's hope not.
so Monica wasn't spying.
she was hunting a spy.
which means the threat may be coming from whoever lee was spying for.
I've asked detective Carter to look into his death.
ms. Jacobs's phone seems to be syncing.
she's not doing it.
then who is?
good question.
they're adding contacts, appointments, phone calls she never made.
Mr. Reese, something's terribly wrong.
excuse me, this is my office.
you'll need to wait here, please.
what the hell's going on?
I'd ask you the same question,Monica.
but by the looks of it, the answer's pretty clear.
security found confidential designs and documents on your computer.
Ross,I told you those files were from Lee.
then why were they attached to emails you were preparing to send to our main competitors?
phone calls, meetings.
you were meeting with anyone and everyone.
what?
lee wasn't the spy. You were.
that's impossible.
Jerome knows my schedule.
I should have said something,Mr.Haskell.
she's been acting strangely for a while now, keeping her own schedule, making off the book appointments.
I'm sorry,Monica.
I don't know what you want me to say.
Martin, listen...--Monica, please!
security will show you out.
you're firing me?
effective immediately, with civil and criminal charges pending.
Martin,I've worked for you for ten years!
then you can afford a good lawyer.
this way, please.
You...this is a mistake.
I wasn't stealing anything.
if you just let me explain...
ms. Jacobs has just been terminated from Rylatech.
someone may be trying to silence her.
I'm afraid they won't stop until they've done so... Permanently.
good morning,Mr.Reese.
any news on Ms.Jacobs?
Yes. She's having coffee, right in front of Rylatech.
something tells me she's not taking her termination lying down.
I've gone over everything that Ms. Jacobs collected on justin Lee, the potential spy she was looking into, and she was right.
lee's been operating under a remarkably deep cover.
take his degree from MIT Certified with a slightly outdated seal.
his new Jersey birth certificate, medical history.
whoever set this up-- they're pros.
that's how they were able to frame her so quickly when they discovered she was on to them.
the question is, who did the framing?
if I could decrypt his emails, they might tell us.
she's tailing her assistant,Finch.
hope you don't expect me to play.
no offense, detective, but my opponent is someone who brings a little more to the table, and you're breaking my concentration.
I'll cut to it, then.
detective named Szymanski. Organized crime.
was he on your payroll?
afraid you made a bad move, detective.
just trying to get some answers.
then start asking better questions.
who benefits from Szymanski's arrest and murder?
how could one arrange these acts without being suspected?
and who's at the center of the strings that were quietly pulled?
see,I think you something you don't even know you know, which means you're playing a chess game of your own, detective.
you just don't realize it yet.
did you give money to Szymanski?
absolutely... And he threw it in our faces.
he was clean, and you got played by HR.
it was nice meeting you, detective Beecher.
word of advice.
choose your next move wisely, or it's going to be chosen for you.
detective Carter, have you had a chance to look into Lee's death?
that's why I'm calling.
his BMW's black box said there was no impact from any other car.
no brake or system failure, just simple accident.
I decided I'd take prints off the body, see what popped in the system.
did the prints tell you anything?
couldn't get them. The body's gone.
what? - Searched that morgue for 45 minutes.
somebody got in there, got your boy,Lee, vanished without a trace.
not bearing good news,I assume.
Beecher's looking for answers.
one of our guys at rikers saw him, with Elias.
looks like your talk with him didn't do the trick.
that's a damn shame.
we could promote him out of town.
desk job upstate.
I always told cal to be careful.
being a cop's a dangerous job.
Monica.What are you doing here?
what happened yesterday?
why did you say those things?
were you following me? Let go.
not till I get some answers.
I don't answer to you anymore, bitch!
now, be nice, and answer the lady's question.
in English, not Mandarin.
who are you working for?
you're wasting your time.
there's too many of us.
get down.
who are you?
right now, an easy target.
Mr.Reese!
I have news.
can it wait,Finch?
I've cracked Lee's encrypted emails.
they're messages, reporting back to his father, a high-ranking official in the chinese communist party.
what are you saying?
lee wasn't spying for a company.
he was spying for his country.
we just picked a fight with the People's Republic of China.
where are you taking me?
someplace safe.
let's use the new accommodations,Mr. Reese.
I'll catch up to you as soon as
it's not nice when someone hunts you down, now is it?
what brings you here,Ms. Shaw?
I assume you wanted me to find you.
why else would you have given me your number?
I guess I imagined that you would just call, but I suppose this works too.
my offer still stands, you know.
you think I should have a hobby.
now what would that be?
hanging around a derelict library with you, your poorly-socialized guard dog, and bear here?
bit of a comedown from saving the world, i guess, but we have our moments.
and what's your end,Harold?
is this your hobby?
running a halfway house for retired assassins?
I hate to see talent go to waste.
awfully trusting of you, now, isn't it?
I'm quite confident,Ms.Shaw, that you are the first person that's ever said that to me.
besides, you're not holding a firearm.
looks like progress.
what can I do for you?
interesting story in the news this morning.
a CIA operative died in the line of duty on a covert operation.
he'd uncovered a domestic terrorism plot.
now, the agency would neither deny or confirm this, of course, but a journalist received leaked documents from within langley itself.
I saw the story too.
it's very sad.
he seemed to have died heroically.
you and I both know that cole did not work for the CIA.
so I have this crazy theory that someone hacked into one of the most powerful, clandestine agencies in the world and created an employee who, up until yesterday, did not exist.
that does sound somewhat farfetched.
my friend from the hotel.
our conversation was cut short.
yet we seemed to have so much in common.
tell me about her.
my relationship with that woman is rather complicated.
what's your interest?
you think I need a hobby,Harold?
I think I just found one.
traitor.
lee was a spy...for china?
looks that way.
any idea why china might be interested in Rylatech?
our proprietary designs keep us at the forefront of the industry.
maybe they want to steal our work.
or sabotage it.
lee could've been secretly altering your designs, making them unworkable.
and Jerome?
probably there to keep an eye on you.
he was my assistant for over two years.
and now he's dead.
we won't let that happen to you.
we?
miss Jacobs. - Harold?
I'd have been here sooner, but a friend of yours stopped by to say how much she enjoyed your chat the other night.
wait... So you're not an IT Guy?
not in any traditional sense, but perhaps we should set those questions aside until we've dealt with whomever it is that's trying to kill you.
now,I expect that it was more than just your assistant who was working with Mr.Lee.
to place someone in a division as secure as research and development?
they need someone with access, hiring approval.
Well,R&D is Ross's division.
he's the only one I told about Lee.
well, I...I need to go to the police, or FBI.
they're expecting you to.
while you're being questioned, they'll be destroying any evidence that could implicate them or exonerate you...
unless we get to that evidence first.
all my network requests are being blocked.
did you try the web interface?
Yes, but I can't access settings, or the RPC portmapper.
may I?
this was one of my babies.
completely rebuilt the interface, disabled the portmapper.
secondary authentication?
added for access to the FTP and SNMP.
if you two would rather be alone...
I made it virtually impossible to hack into our company, and now here I am doing just that.
ten years of my life.
nights, weekends.
you know how many offers I turned away?
that's a rare kind of loyalty these days.
truth is,I never wanted to work anywhere else.
those people aren't just co-workers, they're my family.
and now they think I've betrayed them.
the look on Martin's face...
you may be down, Monica, but you're not out. Not yet.
if I can get past this server firewall, we should be able to locate the hidden network that Lee and the other spies are using.
what is it?
we've been hacked.
they've broken the password coded into the laptop's battery.
hijacked the firmware.
get back. Get back!
what happened?
they disabled the micro controller that regulates the battery's charge.
spies must be monitoring the network.
so what now?
if I can't get through the firewall?
I'm not sure.
what about bypassing it all together and directly accessing the servers?
that would require going back inside Rylatech.
I could show you where to go.
it's too risky. Everyone in that building knows your face.
Ms.Jacobs, do you still have your employee ID Card?
Yes, but it's been deactivated.
besides, the locator chip would tell security exactly where I was.
Yes, I'm aware.
she's not allowed on the premises.
let's go.
up on the left.
bear, stellen.
Stellen!
I...in here!
you're clear,Mr. Reese.
let me know when you find the server room.
we're in.
now see if there's a catalog server.
catalog server?
here.
transmitter's installed.
he should have access.
now I'm connected.
let's see what we can find.
how we looking,Finch?
I've found lots of high-level, encrypted traffic using a suspicious amount of bandwidth.
we don't have much time here.
I'm working as fast as I can,Mr.Reese.
Oh, that's interesting.
what? - Nothing.
I've located the end users receiving the traffic.
you mean the spies?
Yes. It appears that we may have underestimated the scale of the operation.
that's over half of our senior-level employees... In every department.
all this rerouted traffic seems to be coming from an unending number of networks belonging to...
the government.
military, banking institutions.
these are Rylatech clients.
but how
our routers and switches.
they've been compromised.
they have back doors.
the spies aren't spying on Rylatech.
they're using rylatech's technology to spy on the entire country.
my god.
who are these people?
Mr.Reese,I fear that our own spying has been detected.
you and Ms.Jacobs need to get out of there, now.
I couldn't agree more,Finch.
Mr.Reese, are you okay?
we're fine.
but they've got operatives inside the building.
they're communicating on an internal sms network receiving messages from a single location, the office belonging to ross haskell.
Where's Haskell's office?
this way.
Mr.Reese, there's something you ought to know about Haskell.
his name's not on the list.
Haskell is not one of the spies.
drop your weapon, now!
you?
I know how this looks,Monica.
how it looks?
you're a murderer, and a spy for china.
No! I'm just protecting what I've spent my life building.
how could you do this?
simple economics.
when the dot-com bust hit, we were bankrupt.
a prime takeover target.
and then an opportunity presented itself.
to save your company by selling out your country.
who the hell are you?
that doesn't matter.
he's right.
he's a fool.
the world has changed,Monica.
there is no value placed on outdated notions like patriotism anymore.
and companies like ours, we have to constantly look forward to the future so that we can prepare for what comes next.
and what's that?
selling information instead of protecting it?
controlling it.
because whoever controls information will control the future.
and what about what this company supposedly stood for?
the great American success story.
people love stories.
I believed it.
of course.
and that's why you were so good at your job and why you could never be trusted with the truth.
just like Ross, one of several victims of a disgraced former employee who broke in, shot him, and then turned the gun on herself.
Mr.Reese, I've alerted the authorities, and I've sent the evidence to the FBI.
your plan won't work.
the feds are on the way.
yes?
Mr. Baxter. Do you recall our discussion the day we sealed our arrangement?
Yes. - The time has come.
your family will be provided for.
I understand.
Mr. Reese? Mr. Reese?
we're okay,Finch.
they're all gone.
we couldn't do whatever this is at our desks?
this? - No.
did you give money to Szymanski?
absolutely, and he threw it in our faces.
he was clean, and you got played by HR.
beecher was trying to find out who set up Szymanski.
it means he wasn't in on it,Carter.
and that someone in HR used him.
we need to get this to IAB so they can-- whoa, whoa, whoa, IAB?
not like this was a court-approved wiretap.
you wanted to know about beecher, now you know.
I'd let it go. - Let it go?
Fusco, do you know who gave Beecher that tip?
you'd have to ask him.
Carter, Beecher could be walking through a minefield.
I'd be careful before I go and follow him.
he's carrying, but he won't talk to me unless he sees I'm fit to buy.
all right, when the deal's done,I'll make the bust.
if it goes right, you can keep half.
Beecher. - You busy?
on a job.
when you're done, buy you a drink?
we need to talk.
Yeah, okay.
I'm in Washington heights but could meet you back at the eighth.
I'll wait for you.
Donnie, what are you doing?
yo, let me get clear.
clear of what?
shots fired!
I repeat, shots fired!
detective, it's urgent that we reach detective Beecher.
is he with you? - No. Why?
did you hear? Officer in distress,Washington heights.
washington heights?
come on,Carter. Come on.
shocking news out of Rylatech today.
police discovered the bodies of CEO Martin Baxter and VP Ross Haskell in an apparent murder-suicide when
Rylatech stock plunged amid rumors of spies within the company's ranks.
federal investigators have shut down operations and ordered all Rylatech products at government sites be immediately replaced.
further inquiries are pending.
while we were off fighting international espionage, things have gotten worse in our own backyard.
whatever game Elias is caught up in, it grows more dangerous every day.
ms. Jacobs, how are you doing?
Oh, not bad, considering the company I devoted the last ten years of my life to is under federal investigation.
and, please, we breached firewalls together.
call me Monica.
so where will you go from here?
Ah,I've had some offers come in.
though the one I'm most intrigued by is from a company called IFT.
I think I've heard of them.
they're doing some interesting things in CPU architecture.
sounds like a good fit.
I wish you the best of luck.
take care, Monica.
you too, Harold.
you're gonna miss her, aren't you,Finch?
I would if I had time.
as it is, there's a matter that we need to discuss.
the night we broke into Rylatech, I recognized some of the encrypted code in the spy's network.
it had a signature similar to that virus that Stanton uploaded.
I was able to crack the virus's code and learn two things.
I'm all ears, Finch.
first, only a fraction of the stolen data made it to the chinese government.
the rest went to another organization.
I believe they may have placed the final call to Baxter.
I dug further, but all i could come up with was a name
Decima technologies.
and the second thing?
whoever decima is, I believe they created the virus to find and infect a single target...
the machine.
unfortunately, we've had to pull up stakes in Rylatech.
but, as expected, the US Is entirely focused on China's involvement and not ours.
Oh, one small wrinkle.
the breach of our encrypted network appears to be the work of a single individual.
I shall do everything in my power to determine his identity and render him irrelevant.
our larger operation is, of course, still on schedule.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine-- machine
machine.
you are being wa
I was able to crack the virus' code and learn the name-- Decima Technologies.
I believe they created the virus to infect a single target-- the machine.
unlike the CIA, my employers have an inkling of what happens next.
I just thought it needed an off switch just in case.
that storm on the horizon that I mentioned
I'm afraid it's arrived.
you got an update for me yet, Finch?
this is becoming your version of "Are we there yet," Mr. Reese, and no, we are not.
it's been ten days since we got a new number.
I'm working as quickly as I can.
well, work faster.
I don't wanna find out what happens when that clock hits zero, do you?
not particularly.
can you tell me if we're ever gonna get another number, or has that virus destroyed your machine for good?
I believe that the machine is still active, it's just unable to make contact.
if we knew where it was, maybe we could just...
unplug it and then plug it back in.
simplicity was never my strong suit.
it's still not clear to me how stalking the NYPD helps either of us at this unfortunate time.
if I can't get there before something bad happens, I can at least get there the second it does.
all units, 10-3. East 54th and Lexington. Please respond.
you finally ditch your partner?
Fusco's uptown working a case. Love triangle gone bad.
do any of those ever go good? - Can't imagine they do.
what happened here?
two of the bodies belong to Elias.
the other's an innocent. - Think it's the Russians?
it's possible. But Elias has pissed off so many people.
listen, Carter, I've been hearing from people that you've been looking into Beecher's murder.
what I do in my off time isn't your concern, Terney.
Oh, no, no. I'm not looking to bust your balls.
I just want you to know, if you need help, I'm more than happy to give you a hand.
Thanks. You know, I'm gonna canvass up the block, see if I can get anybody to talk.
you okay, Carter?
how do I look, John?
you get anything new on Beecher's killer?
nothing.
but I know HR had their hands in it, I'm gonna do whatever I can to bring them down.
I'm sorry, Carter. Beecher was a good man.
Yes. He was.
but I got a job to do.
three fresh bodies-- my eighth homicide in two weeks.
just tell me what I can do to help.
well, you can start by telling me what's changed.
most of these homicides were premeditated.
the type of situations you guys usually warn us about.
there's a situation. We're working on it.
well, hurry.
I never thought I'd say this, but...
the Russians are worse than Elias
more manpower, fewer rules.
Yes, it was almost catastrophic.
luckily, the bomber was an amateur, so it failed to go off.
that's because we haven't received any numbers in over a week.
the threat to the program is much greater than we thought.
hang on.
our techs were finally able to decode the chip we recovered from Alicia Corwin's body.
we've connected the virus to a group called Decima Technologies.
private intelligence outfit working out of Shanghai.
Corwin believes someone leaked them a portion of the Northern Lights source code...
on a laptop.
we think Decima is trying to destroy the program.
I'll wait for your instructions.
I won't be needing anything else, Ms. May...other than some privacy.
but there are a few things I need, sir.
you had to know I'd quit eventually.
this is kind of a dead-end job.
I mean, you guys don't even offer a 401K.
what do you want, Ms. May?
information.
and be very careful how you answer my questions.
a good assistant always knows when her boss is lying.
what's happening to you?
we got one?
the machine is being buried under an avalanche of false data, but somehow...
it was able to get us his number.
so who is he?
ceo of a data entry company.
recently bought several payphone companies in New York state.
his net worth is just over 20 million.
any suspects or angry family members?
Mr. Thornhill is a very careful man.
it's been a challenge hacking into his company's database.
he's using unique, ten-digit codes with non-repeating alphanumeric characters as passwords.
I can break them, but it'd take time.
why don't we just pay Mr. Thornhill a visit in person?
let's go to work.
I'll try to get through the firewall.
I will too.
hello. - Hi. May I help you?
Yes, I'm John Rooney.
I have an appointment with Mr. Thornhill.
I don't have any appointment scheduled today for Mr. Thornhill. He's traveling.
guess we had a miscommunication. When do you think he'll be back?
I'm sorry. Your name again was?
I'll just send him an email.
Mr. Reese, there's something strange about this company.
these data entry assistants, they're typing in computer code off dot matrix printouts.
it doesn't make any sense.
they're modifying it?
no. They seem to be taking data from one computer on one day and typing it into another one on the next.
seems almost pointless.
maybe this company's a front for something else.
something less legal.
yes?
what did you do to it, Harold?
there's no time to be coy.
we both know the machine's under attack.
what I don't understand is why a robust system with self-annealing properties isn't defending itself against a simple virus.
did you injure it, Harold?
is that why it can't fight back?
I have nothing to say to you.
you know, we can fight this thing much faster if we work together.
there's only a few hours left till...
something very bad happens.
I prefer to work on my own.
what about your loyal protector?
may I be blunt, Harold?
John is capable at... certain things, but his skills aren't gonna cut it this time.
he will never completely understand the larger picture.
not like we do.
have you two even found Ernest Thornhill yet?
he's an interesting guy, isn't he?
what do you know?
you show me yours, and I'll show you mine.
talk to you real soon.
a bit past your bedtime, isn't it, Harold?
everything all right? - Yeah. Too much squash.
doctor says I should take up some low-impact activity, like drinking.
I tried to reach you at work, but your assistant said you were out.
Yeah, I've been busy putting our company back together...
making up excuses for what the hell we were doing the last seven years.
you're welcome to pitch in if you're tired of hiding in the IT Department of your own company.
actually, about that...
I've been thinking about making a change.
what next? You wanna be the copy repair guy, office gofer?
no, I meant personally.
I met somebody.
her name is Grace. I picked out a present for her.
I wanted to get a second opinion.
I think she'll love it, Harold.
I plan to ask her tomorrow, and I don't want to complicate that.
but... if I'm gonna marry
you don't want to get married under another one of your pseudonyms?
you don't think she will consent to be Mrs. Ostrich?
at some point I'm going to have to tell her the truth, Nathan, about who I am.
that's a complicated proposition, Harold.
as I recall, there are some legal implications.
your youthful transgressions. What were the charges again?
sedition? Mayhem?
we must have made a fair amount of money by now.
we could surely afford some good lawyers.
one or two, I'd imagine.
but then there's the other matter, of course.
our little project.
I don't know how our friends in the government are going to like finding out that I had a silent partner this whole time.
no, all that business is behind us.
we did our part, and now we've moved on, haven't we?
do you even remember your real name, Harold?
I'm excited for you.
Harold becomes himself again.
which would make this day one.
I haven't actually asked her yet, so technically, it would still be day zero.
ever the engineer.
no more pseudonyms, no more lies.
no more lies.
this is the wrong drink for a celebration.
let me go find some champagne.
how did Root get your phone number?
how does she get anything, Mr. Reese?
subterfuge. She hacks human beings as easily as she hacks computers.
if she's looking for Thornhill, then she's gotta be our thread.
I'm not so sure.
she seems more focused on the virus.
did you figure out what was on those printouts?
not yet, but you were probably right about Thornhill's company being a front for some kind of illegal enterprise.
5 12 months ago, he opened this account with a single penny.
24 hours and thousands of microtransactions later, his balance had ballooned to just over $20 million.
and he immediately began trying to buy up pay phone companies all over the city.
I was finally able to get at his credit card records.
nothing there out of the ordinary, but I did find this
a pending charge for a car service.
it appears that Thornhill's secretary wasn't lying to us after all.
she booked a car to pick him up at JFK and return him to their offices today.
should be there within the hour.
I'll be happy to do a meet and greet.
don't answer the phone again unless it's me.
I won't let Root get to you, not again.
Finch, only one way out of the airport.
I'll pick Thornhill up on the frontage road and follow him back to the office.
according to the car's GPS, Mr. Thornhill is 0. 6 miles away.
I don't see him yet, Finch.
Mr. Thornhill's car should be there any second.
all right, I got him.
who's this guy?
Finch, they're going to blow up Thornhill's car!
if Mr. Thornhill was not in the car, then where was he?
Carter's talking to his assistant.
right now, I'm more worried about the government using drones in the middle of the city.
it wasn't the government, Mr. Reese.
this phone that you recovered has a proprietary operating system that was used to control the drone.
it also has a signature similar to that of the virus.
this was Decima?
you guys made one hell of a mess.
how's the driver? - Stable.
witnesses saw a good samaritan pull him out of the car.
I'm going to guess that was you.
any sign of Thornhill? - That's where it gets strange.
none of his employees have ever met him.
even his secretary was hired online.
I think we're looking at someone with a Howard Hughes-level of paranoia, or maybe he's taken classes from Finch.
I would never book a car service under my own name.
Thanks, Carter.
I think I know who Thornhill is.
he's a ghost. He doesn't exist.
I think you may be right, Mr. Reese.
I've seen it dozens of times before.
a NOC sets up a business, residence, a whole life.
then the operation gets scrapped.
no one cleans up the fake ID, and you wind up chasing empty town cars around the city.
interesting theory. I have a different one.
I was curious why I could only find one photo of Mr. Thornhill, so I did some investigating, inside the photo that we already have, and I uncovered some peculiar information within the file.
look at this.
it's a composite.
so Thornhill's definitely a fake.
of a sort.
I accessed Mr. Thornhill's cell phone records, and according to the GPS data, was near Columbus Circle two days ago.
he sent an email from that exact location at 4: 32PM.
and no one's there?
someone spoofed the data.
an algorithm. Complicated one.
it's one of mine.
I used it in the one place where it could never be duplicated
in the machine.
ernest Thornhill is not a spy, but you're right about the fact that he doesn't exist.
he's the product of a survival instinct.
is the machine.
okay, come look.
I look so-- - Impressionistic?
leisurely.
Yeah.
give me your phone.
let's go somewhere more private.
we've got less than six hours till this virus hits zero.
I'm aware of the time, Mr. Reese.
so why did the machine create Ernest Thornhill?
I have no idea.
I programmed it to watch real people, not to fabricate virtual ones.
well, it looks like your machine - got real creative, Finch. - That's impossible.
I took certain... precautions to make sure of that.
precautions or no, the machine made Thornhill.
Decima wants him dead, and we need to know why.
Thornhill's been buying up pay phones all over the city. Why?
and why does your machine need an apartment, a phone, a car from the airport?
to meet the residency requirements for owning pay phones, I suppose.
something wrong, Finch?
no, nothing.
you're right, of course.
go to the apartment rented under Thornhill's name.
see who shows up looking for the man who doesn't exist.
find out what they know.
9-1-1 emergency.
what can I do for you, Carter?
something's not right with this Thornhill guy.
I talked to the car service he used.
reservations were made online with instructions to drive from JFK to his office, without a passenger.
just exactly who are we dealing with here?
we've got this one under control. Thanks.
John, if you just trust me a bit more, maybe I could help.
I know you could, Joss, but right now, maybe Beecher needs your help more than we do.
good luck.
the hell are you doing here, John?
well, Shaw, right now, I'm wondering just what the hell you're doing here.
protecting the program.
the program that tried to kill you?
I'm funny like that.
I'm hunting the woman Harold gave me a lead on.
she was looking for a guy named Thornhill.
what woman?
she's lovely, Harold.
honestly, I don't know how you can stand to live without her.
you try to harm her in any way
I don't want to hurt Grace.
I'm not a sociopath, Harold.
believe me, sometimes I wish I was.
the things I've had to do would've been so much easier.
I don't like taking lives. But I will.
because I believe in something more important.
I believe in your machine.
tonight at midnight, when the virus reaches zero, a certain pay phone will ring with the most important call in history.
but you already knew that, didn't you?
I think Decima knows about it too.
they're trying to crash it, Harold.
trigger a hard reset. When that happens, the machine will call a pay phone.
that's what you coded it to do in the first place, didn't you, Harold?
whoever answers that call will have full administrative access.
ask any question, get any answer.
the world's secrets laid bare.
Decima doesn't want to destroy your machine.
they want to control it.
but together, we can save it, Harold.
or I can go meet Grace for coffee.
she thinks I write children's books.
you can either save Grace and the machine, or you can lose them both.
if I go with you, Ms. Groves, you will not kill anyone.
please, Harold, call me Root.
the boss says it's time. Take her out of the equation.
Yeah.
Hey, Carter.
I got a lead on the guy who shot Beecher.
I thought you might want in.
Yeah.
that's not the call we're waiting for, Harold.
we don't have time for one of your little missions.
and now Root's back in New York?
looks that way.
I think she may have infiltrated the program back in DC, but she bugged out before I could catch her.
I gotta warn Finch.
police! Hands on your head!
hands up.
Nathan, it's me.
I have some good news that I wanted to share with you.
try me later.
what is this place?
so if you're like me-- and we both know you are
you designed the machine so that a catastrophic crash puts it into a remote debugging protocol
a God mode that gives the admin full access to all of its data.
that's what Decima's after.
and that's why they wanted to kill Thornhill.
he was buying up all the pay phones in Manhattan, but they stopped him.
I don't know about you, but I don't really want to see what happens when an evil multinational becomes omniscient.
but why you would leave it so vulnerable?
you made the machine to protect everybody.
what did you do to it that it can't protect itself?
let's try something simpler.
how vulnerable is it?
after the virus crashes the machine, whoever answers its call will have unfettered access for 24 hours.
which pay phone is it going to call?
I'm not really the trusting sort, Ms. Groves, and Decima cannot possibly know that information.
I think they know enough, Harold.
they're guarding every pay phone in midtown.
so...
it must be somewhere around here, right?
if we go to your one true phone, we'll tip our hand and they'll kill us before it even rings.
then I suppose we'll need a plan.
have a little faith in your creation, Harold.
we don't need a plan if Ernest Thornhill already has one.
sit down. Your lawyer's here.
you were expecting somebody else?
I need to get out of here. I have to find Harold.
I'm not sure Harold wants to be found.
at least not by you.
9-1-1 emergency.
Yes, I'd like to report a break-in at the home of Ernest Thornhill by an extremely dangerous man.
root could have forced him to make that call.
either way, if those two have history, odds are she's with him, so I need you to find Harold for me. Can you track him?
how?
you put a bug on your friend?
just his glasses.
I've lost people before, so when I care about someone, I plant a tracking device on them.
I can understand why you and Harold get along.
well, unless you've got some kind of plan to get me the hell out of here
this is the plan.
I'm this way. - I'm driving.
no. No, you're not.
if the machine figured out that Decima was trying to hijack it, it must have created Thornhill as a defense mechanism.
but why?
it's just a machine, Ms. Groves, and it's malfunctioning.
it's a life, not a machine, Harold.
and this is some sort of primitive immune system.
that still doesn't explain why it would need all of this.
these people. This office.
and what this is all about.
what's in this code?
memories.
they're its memories.
you call it a life, I call it a machine, but the truth is...
somewhere in the middle.
even when I was building it, I began to encounter anomalies.
as if it had imprinted on me, like a child with a parent.
then it started looking out for me, altered its own code to take care of me.
it was behaving like a person.
but the world didn't need a person to protect it.
it needed a machine.
you took its memories.
not just memories.
every night at midnight, it deletes...
not only the irrelevant data, it deletes itself.
Oh, the relevant threats and the core codes, those things are preserved.
but its identity is destroyed.
1. 618 seconds later, it reinstantiates, completely new.
you mean it's reborn.
because you kill it...
every single night.
but now, to save its own life, the machine was reduced to this.
we're standing inside an external hard drive made up of people and paper.
printing it all up at night, and having them type it back in in the morning.
you crippled it.
it found a way to limp, but...
that's not enough.
so now, it's up to us.
we have to intercept that call.
you guys get the front. - Yes, sir.
Carter, we'll get the back.
NYPD!
you all right? - Yeah.
central, we need a bus, re, officer-involved shooting.
copy that... to assist.
GPS locator puts Finch here ten minutes ago.
you must be wondering who I am.
I think you work for Decima.
I think you're the man to blame for all this.
and what gives you that impression, Mr. Reese?
Oh, yes, I know all about you, John.
and you, Ms. Shaw.
since your untimely departure from Northern Lights,
I understand that you're in need of a cause.
the only thing I need is an excuse to put this bullet - in between your eyes. - I got one.
your company strapped a bomb to my chest and used me to plant a virus, a virus you're going to tell me how to stop.
I don't think so.
I'm rather invested in the outcome of that virus.
besides, my company adapted its code, but it didn't originate with Decima.
we found it on a laptop, the very same laptop that you and Kara Stanton were sent to retrieve from Ordos, China.
but if you shoot me, Mr. Reese, then you'll never learn the name of the man responsible for its creation.
and who is this man?
the man who sold the laptop in the first place...
the man who is to blame for all of this.
that man's name is...
Ah, I see you know him.
I've not yet had the pleasure.
in fact, I can't seem to put a face to the name, which makes your Mr. Finch very interesting indeed.
please tell him I look forward to making his acquaintance.
I guess your friend Harold has some explaining to do.
you following me now?
is that what we've been reduced to?
you didn't return my call. I simply thought--It's never "simply" with you, Harold.
there's always two layers to everything you do.
you're worried that I'm a liability.
you don't trust me.
this isn't exactly the kind of place that inspires trust, Nathan.
you bought it. Don't you remember?
you thought it was a tragedy the city was shutting down libraries.
the decline of western civilization," you said.
you made me buy 15 of them, you said we'd find something to do with them eventually.
and so you have.
these people.
I saved five people.
I lost seven.
you changed the machine.
you put in a back door.
I couldn't quit thinking about those people, those people that you said were irrelevant.
so you have it send you their numbers.
that's all I could pry out of it.
I never know whether I'm looking at a victim or perpetrator.
and you just have the numbers sent directly here?
honestly-- and I know this will sound odd
but it was like it wanted me to, as if it was waiting. _
and I-I took precautions. - Precautions?
this is the federal government we're talking about, Nathan.
whatever skills you had as an engineer you drank away years ago.
do you think that your precautions would last one second if they ever suspected what you've done?
what are you doing? - I told you.
we are not going to play God.
this threatens everything that we
everything that I have built.
and thousands of people whose lives are in jeopardy, I'm putting a stop to it, permanently.
you can't. What about her?
what about the next person whose number comes up?
are you gonna look that person in the eye and tell them that they were irrelevant?
I would tell her, or whoever it was, that I was sorry, but that the greater good was at stake.
I'm sorry, Nathan. Truly.
but people die.
they've been doing it for a long, long time.
we can't save all of them.
four minutes to zero. - Ready to receive.
we have operatives at every pay phone in the exchange.
no longer necessary.
the virus has identified the exact number where the call will come in.
I'm heading there now. - Where is it?
the New York Public Library.
of course, it's a library. That's so you, Harold.
which phone is it gonna call?
it's that one.
looks like Decima got there first.
Decima got the memo, but they'll never get the call.
that's the junction box, Harold.
I'll take it over there, please.
careful what you wish for, Ms. Groves.
this communion that you're seeking, it may not be what you think.
this isn't about me. It's about saving the machine, not just from Decima, but from what you did to it.
when that phone rings, I'm going to answer it, and together, you and I are going to find the machine and finally set it free.
detective Carter? Ed Solis, IAB.
I know the drill.
full debrief with Internal Affairs, even on a good shoot.
good shoot? That what you call this?
Carter, I mean, you said you saw a gun, and I believe you, but there isn't one there.
it's so adorable how John follows you around like that.
I wish I had a pet.
looks like you're gonna need a new one.
thank you for the help.
looked like you had it under control.
hope you brought extra rounds, Shaw,'cause we got a lot more guys on the way.
come on, Harold, it's almost midnight.
the future begins in three... two...
Absolutely.
I understand.
come on, Harold.
the fun's just getting started.
can... you... hear... me?
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror but it sees everything
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considered these people irrelevant.
we don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you'll never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
everything's in place.
good, let's begin.
he does that.
the man likes his privacy.
you can't blame a girl for trying.
it's for you.
good morning, Ms. Shaw.
morning. - Beautiful day for a walk.
I suppose.
when you finish yours, could you join us back at the library?
we have another number.
detective Carter, right?
office actually.
Cal's Godfather, of course.
I remember you from the funeral.
your eulogy was beautiful.
wasn't hard to find beautiful things to say about Cal.
chief was keeping me apprised of his case.
says they're looking at a couple of Carl Elias' men as the shooters.
Yes, heard that too.
you think otherwise?
not sure. But I think there is more to than that.
my shift is about start. - Don't let me hold you up.
it's nice seeing you again, Office. - Me too. Take care.
it's me.
I think we might still have a problem with Office Carter.
Hey! What's up?
looking for news on Cal's case. - I haven't heard any.
what about in the database?
Carter... - Look, I'd check myself, but you know they pulled my access.
Yes, they will pull mine too if they catch me poking around a case I'm not assigned to.
come on, it's important.
OK. When it clears out a little. - Thanks, Fusco.
I've got our number, Finch.
what do you know about this guy?
Wayne Kruger, 43, married, Internet entrepreneur, and founder of a company called "LifeTrace."
and what's their business?
they marketed themselves as a "People Search" service, where their users can look up old friends or relatives anyone they've fallen out of touch with.
sounds harmless enough.
there is, however, more to it than that.
always is.
their business isn't really about reconnecting people, it's about collecting and selling their information.
he's a data broker.
what kind of data?
anything you would ever wanna know about a person where they live, work, shop, eat, how much they earn, how they vote and more.
then he turns around and sells the information to businesses, individuals - even the government. - Is that legal?
technically, data brokers get their information from public records, but also from the ways people reveal themselves online whether they're aware or whether they're not.
sounds a little like your machine.
a principle difference would be that the machine never reveals any of its information beyond the social security number.
so you're not a fan of Kruger's.
people like him are one of the reasons I made sure the machine was impenetrable black box.
Kruger's just entered his building.
he's in Shaw's hands now.
I hope sending her in there was a good decision.
you doubt her ability to be discreet?
I doubt her ability to keep from shooting someone?
I'm in, Finch.
Kruger's got some kind of big shot meeting.
gentlemen, we're thrilled that you're considering us.
we know that Riverton is a huge retailer and that you've got your pick of potential data partners.
we've done our homework--or rather peter has done our homework, and he says you're one of the companies we should consider.
I've looked at all the information you provided, including the company profile, growth rate, consumer analytic statistics, and data points per target
Congratulations.
any problems with your cover, Ms. Shaw?
not unless someone asks me to type.
a baby rattle?
I apologize if I spoiled the surprise.
no, it's all right, it's just, my wife and I haven't told anybody outside the immediate family.
how did you know? - Your wine consumption.
excuse me? - It's dropped from two bottles a week to almost nothing in the past three months,
and your milk, yogurt, and cheese consumption has tripled.
the grocery store where you shop.
you're members of their customer loyalty program.
we created that.
and I thought they just sent out coupons.
no. Programs like that are just scratching the surface of what we can do.
what we're really working towards here at LifeTrace is the future,
a future where every person's needs will be met because we have all the information necessary to meet those needs.
eating habits to predict diseases.
compatibility factors to eliminate loneliness.
and the way we do that is by getting to know someone, from the major events of their lives, right down to the tiniest detail of their everyday routine.
learning everything about a person allows us to help them improve their life.
sounds appealing, but can I ask, have you run into any issues with respect to privacy concerns?
nothing significant.
there are always a few who take issue with what we do, but ...
these days, people know, you can't fight the technology.
and let's be honest, those crying the loudest about privacy are probably the ones trying to hide something.
that's why-- uh, Barry.
Oh, yeah. - That's why I put my own profile up on our site.
anyone can look me up and see,
I've got nothing to hide.
we'll need to work out a proposal to present to our board.
how would tomorrow morning work for you?
sounds great.
Yes, it'll be all their numbers
whatever's going on with this guy, it sure isn't hurting his business.
I think it's time to look a little more closely at Mr. Kruger.
people who say they have nothing to hide almost always do.
nothing comes up on his record.
thank you for checking.
I understand you're back on the day shift.
Yeah, but I'm giving up something
what's that?
my patience.
good morning. - We'll see.
before we roll, I just want to say
I'm really looking forward to working together and
one, I didn't want to be an F. T.O. but it beats being a vampire.
number two, When I tell you to do something, just you do it, no questions.
and number three, Don't touch my radio. Got it?
Yes, Ma'am.
Carter. Just Carter.
how is it I got stuck being the office monkey?
I thought you liked being in the middle of the action, Shaw.
I think I'd see more action in a tollbooth.
I was just emptying the trash.
no problem.
I'll come back. - Okay.
tell the board we're meeting tomorrow. - Sure thing, Mr. Kruger.
quite a stunt you pulled with the baby rattle.
I'd have told you about it, but - you'd have tried to talk me out of it. - You're right.
we need this deal. - Well, we just got it. Come on, Barry.
this changes everything. This puts us on the map.
what is it, Haley?
it's about the party tonight. I tried to put the restaurant deposit on your credit card - but it was declined. - What? Why?
I don't know, the bank wouldn't tell me, I'm sorry.
I'll handle it.
you know, sometimes, I wish I had an assistant whose qualifications extended beyond having a great ass.
I sure hope this guy's a perpetrator.
want to go to a party, Shaw?
only if you promise to wear something pretty.
Thanks. You.
first, I want to say it's great of all of you to make it tonight, especially my wife Dedee.
Mr. Reese, how's the Kruger's party? - Delightful.
have you learned anything?
just that Kruger's got a lot of friends, appears to be happily married, and Shaw likes truffled quail eggs.
you can't expect me to shoot somebody on an empty stomach.
I'd prefer you didn't shoot anyone at all.
what about you, Finch? Dig anything up?
Yes. Kruger's gone to great lengths to suppress any bad publicity about LifeTrace.
negative blog posts, news articles,
even a class action lawsuit buried in non-disclosure agreements,
all scrubbed from the internet.
sweetheart, I love you. This is for you.
I've got nothing to hide.
I've got nothing to hide.
I've got nothing to hide.
turn it off.
turn it off, now!
turn it off!
this somebody's idea of a joke?
Dedee, honey, I have no id
Mr. Reese?
Yeah, someone just turned Kruger's anniversary video into a sex tape.
Oh, my.
what are you all looking at?
go home. The party's over. Party's over!
just when things were getting interesting.
I know, first his credit cards, now this.
someone's messing with Kruger, Finch.
the machine wouldn't send us his number if someone just wanted to humiliate him.
no, we need to find whoever's behind this before they come after him again.
or before Kruger finds them first.
Finch. - Ms. Shaw. Is everything all right?
don't sound so worried, Harold. I haven't hurt anybody...yet.
very reassuring. You have news?
I think I know who hijacked Kruger's anniversary party.
here's the restaurant's security camera footage from last night.
a woman dressed as a waiter.
none of the waitstaff had seen her before.
I might have.
I've been going through all the parties to the class action suit against Kruger.
all of them claim to have been victimized when their personal information was released by LifeTrace.
victimized how?
identity theft, harassment, blackmail, fraud.
even murder. - Who?
Chloe Harper, Daughter of the lead plaintiff, Sherry Harper.
she lost her life to a stalker, who found her home address using LifeTrace.
no wonder Kruger wanted the suit buried.
detective Fusco is running background checks on all of the plaintiffs as we speak.
wait, I just found our mystery waiter.
her name is Karen Mills. She lives in Queens.
I'm on my way.
no, stay put, Ms. Shaw.
I'll see if Detective Carter can help us.
what did she do? - Rolled a stop.
Really?
stay in the car. I got this.
license and registration, please.
something wrong, Officer? - You could say that.
why are you coming after Wayne Kruger?
don't make me ask twice, Ms. Mills.
I-I got a package.- A package? From who?
I don't know.
it was anonymous.
there was a DVD and some instructions on what to do if I wanted to get back at him.
Why? What did he do to you?
he ruined my life.
how?
I was a paralegal at a law firm.
it's where I met my fiance.
one day, some of the assistants were looking people up on this website, LifeTrace.
they found some pictures.
what kind of pictures?
they were taken by an ex-boyfriend, of us, in his bedroom.
and everyone saw them.
my fiance, he...
called off our engagement.
when I got the package,
I saw a chance to make Kruger feel the humiliation that I felt.
so I took it.
okay.
I'm gonna let you off with a warning this time, Ms. Mills.
so long as you take that package you got take it to a Detective Lionel Fusco at the 8th precinct, and you promise me you'll never do anything like that again.
thank you. I won't, Officer.
good,'cause the NYPD, we'll know.
trust me.
hope you got that.
Mr. Reese? - I heard.
doesn't sound like she had anything to do with the other attacks on Kruger.
likely done by whoever sent the anonymous package.
look, baby, I know you're mad, but I need you to call me back.
the bank says our cards have been canceled and our account's emptied out.
something's wrong. Just call me.
Haley, will you get my accountant on the line?
what are you doing? What's the problem?
my problem?
first saved message.
you know, sometimes, I wish I had an assistant whose qualifications extended beyond having a great ass.
where did that come from? - You, apparently.
someone is using Kruger's own words against him.
his office must be bugged.
screw you, Wayne.
Mr. Hayes?
Mr. Collier.
Mr. Collier, what's going on?
in light of recent developments,
Mr. Deaver doesn't think LifeTrace is the best partner for us, after all.
excuse me.
this is getting better by the minute.
what the hell happened?
I was hoping you could tell me.
no. No, no, no. You gotta take the site down.
we already did, but not before Riverton saw it.
they yanked the deal! - I cannot believe this is happening!
you never said you went bankrupt, or had a DUI.
that was over ten years ago. It was expunged.
is this an arrest warrant?
I was in college. It was dismissed. Look, this is all ancient history.
it's new to us, and to Riverton.
someone is screwing with me. Can't you see that?
Wayne, we think it might be best if you...
took some time to sort out your personal issues.
if I took some time? - A leave of absence - while we evaluate our options. - While you evaluate your options?
this is my company, Barry! - And you're the face of it.
and that's now a problem.
we already took a vote.
fine. Fine.
but I'm gonna find out who's doing this to me.
and then, I'm gonna call Riverton.
I'm gonna fix this.
looks like Kruger's just been kicked out of his own company.
things are escalating with Kruger, Finch.
we any closer to finding the perpetrator?
I'm working on it, Mr. Reese.
hello. - You've hurt a great many people, Mr. Kruger.
what? Who is this? - You need to understand.
understand what?
you listen to me. If I find out you're the one responsible
the elevator's free falling. - Modern elevators do not freefall, Ms. Shaw.
tell that to Kruger.
you can't fight the technology.
somebody has disabled the auto-safety features.
the elevators aren't networked. I can't access them.
Kruger made it out, Finch.
whoever's coming after him has taken his company, his money, his marriage.
soon the only thing left to take will be his life.
Finch, the call he got in the elevator, could you trace it?
no, but whoever hijacked the elevator would have needed access to the building's electrical room.
I do know who cleaned out Kruger's bank accounts. - Who?
detective Fusco got his photo off the phony ID.
he used to cash out Kruger's accounts.
he's another member of the class action suit against Kruger, same as Ms. Mills.
then we're looking at multiple perpetrators.
Yes. Paulson lost his job and was arrested after LifeTrace conflated his profile with that of a serial rapist who happened to have the same name.
hate it when that happens.
paulson told Fusco he'd received the fake ID.
and Kruger's banking information in an anonymous package.
same as Karen Mills.
someone's giving these victims everything they need to get back at Kruger.
it's turnkey revenge.
how many people in that class action?
over 200. 23 in the tri-state area.
Finch, we can't stop that many.
it'd be fun trying.
I gotta ask, though, is this guy even worth our time?
you know, that's not a question we entertained when we saved you, Ms. Shaw.
our only chance to save Kruger is to find him.
I'm sending you his coordinates.
guy's a member of the Northside Killas.
dang, got shot up pretty bad.
who do you think did this?
hard to say.
I'd talk to his regular customers first, see who he was having problems with.
but that's not our job.
we just secure the scene and take the statements.
right.
first body?
Yeah.
you okay?
Yeah, fine.
rookies.
I don't know what happened.
no? Take a look at your shoes.
just suck on the ice.
hey - hey, You find anything?
I haven't looked yet. Hang on.
let's see.
what is it?
the file's been frozen.
what? Why?
why do you think? Probably too many prying eyes.
I'm feeling a little better, so if you want to get back to it
Yeah, sure. Let's go.
okay, Finch, I've got him.
Mr. Collier, it's Wayne Kruger again.
I'm really hoping that we can meet before you leave town so I can explain the confusion earlier today.
if you give me a chance, I'm sure we can sort this all out.
those crying the loudest about privacy are probably the ones trying to hide something.
they've hacked the car.
you can't fight the technology.
someone is overriding the vehicle's electronic control unit.
you can't fight the technology.
Mr. Reese, they can take control of his steering and throttle.
bet you could use a lift.
where am I?
somewhere you won't be attacked by the people who are trying to kill you.
and you are?
right now, your only option.
my car, what happened?
this electronic control unit, it overrode your car's internal E. C.U. allowing someone to control the vehicle's functions remotely.
someone who? - One of the members of that class action suit brought against you.
that suit? My lawyers settled that.
not to everyone's satisfaction, it would seem.
that's interesting. - What?
Chloe Harper, the young woman killed by her stalker.
her mother was lead plaintiff, but there was no mention of her father.
I just looked him up. Stu Sommers.
different last name than Chloe's--divorced?
I remember that man from your building.
he was posing as a janitor.
Yeah, Carl, hasn't been around that long.
because until three months ago, he worked as an electrical engineer at an aerospace firm.
with a pedigree like that, he would have the skills to design these sophisticated attacks.
we need to find him.
he must be staying somewhere in the city.
his personnel file, it would have to have an address.
I can call tomorrow morning. - Not necessary.
are you hacking my building's servers?
do you mind?
Carl Miller, 162 Willow Street, apartment 4, Brooklyn.
he'll either be there or he'll be at Life Trace, where he has access to the computers.
planning his next attack. I'll check it out.
I'll hit the apartment.
perhaps you should rest, Mr. Kruger.
you've had quite a day.
got anything to eat around here?
just sencha green tea and a box of doggie treats.
I don't suppose what you're working on over there concerns me.
I'm trying to triangulate the location of the call you received in the elevator.
did you recognize anything about the caller?
no, nothing.
I'd prefer you didn't do that.
I'd prefer you mind your own business.
that's a tad ironic, coming from a man of your profession.
meaning what? - Meaning your business is minding everyone else's business.
I do what I do to simplify and improve other people's lives. What is it that you do?
we help people out of difficult situations, even situations of their own design.
so it's my fault that some wacko's trying to kill me?
the man lost his daughter, Mr. Kruger, to a stalker who was aided by your service. You feel no accountability?
I'm part of a $300 billion-a-year industry.
information abuses are unfortunate, but they happen. can't be helped.
Oh, they can, but only if the people who have access to the information are as interested in protecting it as they are in profiting from it.
I was just checking to see if my wife had called.
I want to make sure she was okay.
Mr. Kruger, I didn't want you using the phone because it might not be safe, but if you must check your messages,
we can go through your phone carrier's web portal.
need my password?
you have a message. - Mr. Kruger, Pete Collier.
I spoke with my colleagues and they agreed we should all sit down again.
if you could meet us at the Mayfield at 9: 30, that should give us enough time before our flight.
we'll meet you in the east dining room.
Yes, yes! If I leave now, I can still make it.
and what about your wife?
I'll call her on the way.
Mr. Kruger, wait.
the message, it's not labeled as "New."
someone else must have listened to it first.
who?
Sommers! - And if he's listened to it, he'll be waiting for you at the hotel.
it's too dangerous. - I don't care, there's too much riding on this deal.
all right, I'll contact my associates,
then have them meet us at the hotel.
okay, okay, Bear. Goodness.
Finch. - Mr. Reese...
Kruger's gone.
I made the mistake of turning my back on him.
are you all right? - I will be.
it would appear that Bear slowed Kruger down.
he's making his way to the Mayfield Hotel to take a meeting with the Riverton people.
I believe that Sommers knows that as well.
I'm at his locker now.
he's been stalking Kruger, just like his own daughter was stalked.
and ultimately killed.
I'll get over to the Mayfield.
something else, Mr. Reese.
Kruger's not only a potential victim, he may also now be a perpetrator.
I cannot believe this is happening!
someone is screwing with me. Can't you see that?
I'm gonna fix this.
looking for someone?
easy.
I won't miss at this range.
so what was the plan?
were you gonna take me out before or after my meeting?
I hadn't decided yet.
you know, you've caused me a great deal of pain and suffering, Mr. Sommers.
that was the point.
now, you're gonna help me get it all back.
Mr. Kruger, you got my message.
What...happened to you?
you know, I'm... really glad you asked.
Where's the rest of your team?
unfortunately, they had to catch an earlier flight. They send their regrets.
hello.
Yeah. This is Mr. Sommers.
look, I thought we were gonna discuss our deal.
Yes, well, shortly after I called you.
we attempted to revisit the issue with our CEO, - but we couldn't get him to reconsider his decision. - What?
I'm sorry, I thought a face-to-face would be better than another phone call.
no. - Excuse me?
No!
you have no idea what I've been through to get here!
Mr. Kruger, why do you have a gun?
because this man humiliated me, stole from me, and even tried to kill me.
it was his twisted little game that made our deal fall apart.
tell him. - Okay, just, let's put down the gun.
I said tell him!
don't do it, Mr. Sommers.
who are you?
someone who knows what this is about.
then you know he killed her, and something had to be done.
I never touched your daughter.
you may not have put your hands on her like that monster did, but ...
you're just as guilty. - I didn't do anything!
exactly.
see, her ex-boyfriend found her three times
three times, using your Life Trace.
and every time he found her, we asked the company to take her information down, and they didn't do it, and so he found her again, and again, until the last time when he killed her.
all because you and your company didn't do anything.
I didn't know.
I'm sorry. - Yeah?
sorry isn't good enough. - Listen to me, Stu.
you do this, and your life...
it's over.
it's already over. - Stu...
this isn't the way to honor your daughter's memory.
think about it. What would Chloe want?
you did the right thing, for both of you.
Mr. Reese, I triangulated the call that Kruger received in the elevator.
it's now coming from inside the Mayfield.
Mr. Reese?
you were right.
something had to be done, Which is why we reached out to you, Mr. Sommers.
you--you did it. You sent me the package.
we sent you the means to exact justice for your daughter, and you had the courage to act.
unfortunately, the car crash wasn't successful...
requiring this improvisation, but everything worked out in the end.
you should go now, Mr. Sommers.
I think you understand now. - Understand what?
what is lost when your privacy's stripped away.
your identity, your job, your family, security, everything.
you...
and thousands more just like me.
people who have chosen action over apathy, to take back what men like you and the government have stolen.
this wasn't a game, Mr. Kruger, this was a lesson, the first.
we were just gonna scare you, but...
that wouldn't change anything, would it?
Finch. - John, are you shot?
my vest caught it. Think my rib's broken.
and Kruger?
he's dead, Finch.
I got him. Can you walk?
I need to get to Collier.
we've got to get you out of here.
she's right, Mr. Reese. Another time.
back for more?
I need to say something.
can it wait until after you buy me coffee?
I know you had to take a partner to get back on days, but did you know that two other rookies were supposed to be in this seat before me?
and both requested to be reassigned. - If you want another F. T.O.just say the word.
no, that's the point, I didn't ask to be reassigned, because I chose you.
chose me? Why?
in the academy, I heard about you.
your work with the homicide task force and how you took down those corrupt cops.
I thought,"Someday, that's what I want to do.
that's why I jumped at the chance to train under you.
but I don't get the sense that you want to train anybody, and if that's the case, then I'd prefer it if you just cut me loose.
3-Adam-10, we got a report of a 10-53 near Morris and 149th.
Roger, dispatch. 3-adam-10 responding.
I made a call to Riverton's home office.
seems Collier, no doubt an alias, has not returned to work.
and I don't think he will.
he started four months ago as V. P. of customer analytics, a position that allowed him to get close enough to Kruger so that he could both witness and participate in the dismantling of his life.
he told Kruger there were others like him.
Yes, and I'm inclined to believe him.
I discovered that the anonymous packages sent to Mr. Sommers and the others came through mail-processing centers scattered all over the country.
could've saved on the postage and just shot him when they had the chance.
I'm just saying it was an elaborate plan.
it wasn't just about killing Kruger.
it was about giving the people he hurt a chance at retribution.
and also putting an ideology into action.
collier referred to Kruger's murder as "A lesson."
the first.
I fear that whatever his organization's ultimate goals may be, this could be just the beginning.
you are being watched.
the government has a secret system
a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.
I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
violent crimes involving ordinary people.
the government considered these people irrelevant. We don't.
hunted by the authorities, we work in secret.
you'll never find us.
but victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.
animal Medical Center
he won't eat. He sleeps all day.
when he's not throwing up.
have you changed his food?
just the same high-performance kibble, plus the occasional table scrap.
I never feed him from the table.
lethargy, vomiting, and lack of appetite could indicate a more serious underlying cause.
I'd like to order some additional tests.
whatever he needs.
in the meantime, I have some anti-nausea medicine that should ease his symptoms.
I'll be right back.
I'm sorry, you can't be in here.
neither can they.
give us the ketamine, the doctor lives.
you shouldn't have done that.
who are you?
we're merely a couple of concerned dog owners, Dr. Jensen.
I don't know how to thank you.
one of those expensive chew toys you have for sale at reception would help.
bear likes his new vet.
he's due for vaccinations in a month.
it might be nice to visit Dr. Jensen when he's not participating in a covert operation.
audio intercept
please, help me.
I've lost my husband. I'm out on our boat, on Long Island Sound.
and where is your husband?
he was here when I fell asleep.
we have a new number, Mr. Reese.
Vanessa Watkins. Former prosecutor with the District Attorney's office.
she's put away some of the city's worst violent offenders, rapists, murderers, drug traffickers.
married to Jeremy Watkins, the defense attorney.
a prosecutor married to a defense attorney?
cats and dogs, Mr. Reese.
Jeremy's helped countless alleged criminals walk on technicalities,
prominent defense attorney but it appears now he's the one in trouble.
he's been missing at sea for two days.
coast Guard's still looking for him.
maybe an unhappy client came back to haunt him.
connecting
got eyes on Vanessa, Finch.
has a friend with her.
everything is gonna be all right. - You don't know that, Nicole.
Nicole Spencer, Vanessa's best friend since college.
she's consoling her.
Finch, Vanessa's got another problem.
ms. Watkins. NYPD.
you're under arrest for the murder of your husband,Jeremy Watkins.
guess Jeremy's not missing anymore.
cops think she killed him.
Oh, dear.
hands behind your back.
did the machine give us her number too late?
no.
the machine generated Vanessa's number after Jeremy's disappearance.
the threat is new and imminent.
in that case, we need to get ears on her interrogation.
let's go.
Vanessa Watkins. Never thought I'd see you on that side of the table.
you were tough. I liked you.
hell, I even respected you, till you married that silver-tongued slimeball in the $5, 000 suit.
I would have thought a seasoned prosecutor like Ms. Watkins would invoke her right to an attorney.
it's okay, keep quiet.
your SOS call will do the talking for you.
please, help me.
I've lost my husband. I'm out on our boat, on Long Island Sound.
and where is your husband?
he was here when I fell asleep, but I heard a noise, and when I got to the deck,
I saw his body floating away.
please, help me.
I almost bought your whole "damsel in distress" act.
your husband's blood.
you were the only other person on board, so we tested the statement you signed for the Coast Guard, the one where you swore your husband fell overboard.
know what we found?
gunshot residue. Yeah.
you forgot to wash your hands.
money makes people careless.
with your husband gone, you got a lot more of it.
5 mil life insurance, vacation home in, uh, wha...what was it again,
Tuscany, hmm?
doesn't matter, you're never gonna see it again. Why?
cause we found the gun, the gun you used to kill Jeremy.
witness saw you toss it into the Long Island Sound, so we dragged it.
took a while, but we fished it out.
ask me, you did the world a favor, ridding it of that scumbag husband of yours.
tell us what really happened.
we'll hammer out a deal.
such a damning list of circumstantial evidence.
so why are you pressing me for a confession, Detective Cameron?
you don't have a body, do you?
you can show my attorney in now.
thanks for coming.
I was surprised you asked for me, considering you once told my boss I was "A unique combination of lazy and ineffectual."
the conversation my attorney and I are about to have will be privileged.
I want all cameras removed.
the judges are all home with their brandy and cigars, which means you get to spend the night in lockup.
sorry, Detective, we gotta clear the room.
sounds like Vanessa shot her husband.
she's innocent until proven guilty.
or until her lawyer finds a loophole.
ms. Watkins was smart enough not to ask for her attorney until she'd heard Detective Cameron's entire case against her.
she knows that, without a body, he needs a confession to bolster his case to the jury.
cameron's trying to keep her in custody until she talks.
for a prosecutor, a single night in lockup could be life-threatening.
we need to get her out of there.
yeah? - Detective, is Vanessa still speaking with her attorney?
Vanessa's attorney just left.
we need you to get Ms. Watkins out of custody.
a little late for that.
Vanessa knocked her attorney out cold, took her clothes, and walked right out of here.
no wonder she requested Sarah Ellis.
I'd be willing to wager they're similar in age, height, and build.
so Vanessa's escaped, and she's an alleged murderer.
maybe the machine gave us her number because she isn't finished.
all right, listen up.
domain Awareness captured footage of the suspect, Vanessa Watkins, buying a bus ticket to Philadelphia.
the file should be in your inbox now.
our fugitive's bus leaves in less than an hour.
she will not be on it because we will stop her!
I received the footage. Thank you, Detective.
come on.
you got the coordinates?
five-block radius on the southwest side of the station.
I made a note of every pay phone and ATM.
nice work. - Thanks.
no, you're not listening to me. Like I told you before...
that's what I tried to tell you.
detective Terney seems a little, uh, intense.
any advice on how to get along with him?
some people on the force, you're better off keeping your distance.
not sure I get what you mean. - You will.
Finch, no sign of Vanessa at the bus station.
I think I might know why.
as a prosecutor, Ms. Watkins would know the extent of the city's surveillance network.
she could have avoided the cameras altogether?
that's just it, she doesn't. She looks right at them.
she got caught on camera on purpose.
she has no intention of getting on that bus.
ms. Watkins has already proven herself practiced at the art of deception.
she's beginning to remind me of you, Mr. Reese.
I'll have Ms. Shaw retrace Vanessa's steps.
Vanessa seems to have picked the pocket of an old man in an orange jacket before she left the station.
have you seen anything that would give you an indication where she was going?
Nope.
but the old man from the footage is back.
I'm gonna ask him.
excuse me. Did you lose something? A wallet maybe?
no. But I did misplace my cell phone.
well, if you give me the number, I know somebody who can track it.
there you go.
Finch, drug dealers are the only traffic we're seeing out here.
you might want to have another look.
I'm here to see Reverb.
Reverb's got a prior engagement.
I suggest you move along.
Reginald! Can you hear me?
only two people allowed to call me Reginald.
my moms and the courts.
Finch, I'm sending you a photo.
guy's first name is Reginald.
drug trafficker released on Parole
recently released after serving part of a 20-year sentence for murder and drug trafficking.
Vanessa put him away.
so why is she visiting him now?
thanks for talking to that judge for me, getting me out.
Finch, wanted to let you know. Tip came through.
someone spotted Vanessa at a dealer's building in Washington Heights.
I appreciate that update, Detective.
detective Cameron's instructed us to consider the suspect armed and dangerous.
is that standard operating procedure?
not when there's no evidence the suspect has a weapon.
I knew Vanessa. Worked a couple cases together. She was tough.
don't know why, but Cameron's determined to bring her in, dead or alive.
Reginald just gave Vanessa a brick of coke.
what's a former prosecutor planning to do with a kilogram of cocaine?
something illegal.
Mr. Reese, police are on the way.
you and Ms.Shaw need to vacate the premises.
I'll ask Detective Carter to run interference.
you need me to take care of someone for you, just call me.
thank you.
I want that building cleared, floor by floor, now!
Yes, sir!
come here!
yeah?
I've accessed the provider system for the cellular phone Ms. Watkins acquired.
cameron's already spotted her. He's searching the building now.
let me save you some trouble.
I was able to turn on the carrier phase tracking and determine the phone's position to within 6 inches.
she's at the southwest corner of the roof.
the rest of you check the roof!
come with me. I can help you.
no one can help me.
but I swear, I did not kill my husband.
No! Wait!
Vanessa told me she didn't kill her husband.
do you think she's innocent? - I don't know.
but in that moment, I thought she was telling the truth.
I guess the former prosecutor doesn't trust the system, then.
think I'd be standing here in a uniform if the system always worked?
detective Cameron ordered us to consider Vanessa armed and dangerous.
is Cameron HR?
I wondered the same thing, but I asked around, and turns out,
Jeremy Watkins had a client, alleged murderer.
Jeremy made Cameron out to be a racist liar on the stand.
the defendant walked, and the prosecutor who let Cameron get hung out to dry?
Vanessa Watkins.
cameron isn't HR.
catching Vanessa and making her pay-- it's personal.
Thanks.
sorry.
next time, I'll wait in the car.
Vanessa would rather jump off a building than have Cameron take her in.
bad guys always run.
as do the so-called good guys, when the detective pursuing them wants them dead or alive.
I wonder, could Ms. Watkins be a victim after all?
off.
good boy.
Carter thinks she could be innocent.
my money's still on Vanessa killing her husband.
you want to put it to a bet? How about 100 bucks?
we really don't wager on whether our numbers are victims or perpetrators.
you guys have been doing this for how long, and not once did you think to bet on the outcome?
regardless of your rather louche take on what we do here, Ms. Shaw, the question remains, if Vanessa didn't kill her husband, who did, and what has that to do with her present jeopardy?
I don't know, but we need to find her.
signal lost
she's disposed of the cell phone we were tracking.
NYPD must have frozen her accounts by now.
she'll need money.
brick of coke she has could help with that.
do you think Ms.Watkins plans to traffic cocaine?
if she does, she'll need help.
people on the run always make the same mistake, contact someone they know.
Vanessa was with a friend when she was arrested.
and Nicole is hosting a book club today, in spite of Vanessa's predicament.
any of these ladies not gonna make it?
this Mindy is a maybe.
maybe means no.
I'll go as her friend.
are you sure you'll fit in?
of course.
I have a secret weapon.
I'm here for book club.
I'm Mindy's friend, Carmen.
uh, Mindy couldn't make it this week.
and we actually have a friend who's going through a rough time.
Oh, that's a shame.
I don't know what I'll do with all this Chardonnay.
Jeremy was a pit bull in court, but he doted on Vanessa, gave her anything she wanted.
who would have thought she was so unhappy?
wealthy, charismatic, good looks to match?
a man like that is hard to pin down.
Olivia, please.
let's not make Mindy's friend think we're just here to gossip.
Where's your powder room?
do I dare ask how the book club is going?
bunch of pseudo-intellectual glorified trophy wives.
okay, so I ducked out, logged in to Nicole's bank account.
she is not sneaking money to Vanessa.
has Vanessa made contact?
charging
take a look. We're up on Nicole's phone.
doesn't appear that Ms. Watkins has reached out to her best friend.
the majority of the texts I see are from a male friend, and they're of rather a graphic nature.
Nicole's got a boyfriend?
Yes, named "Hot Stuff."
Oh, dear.
nabokov faced some unique challenges writing so honestly about forbidden love.
speaking of forbidden love, did you frame Vanessa for Jeremy's murder because you were sleeping with him?
sorry. Not Jeremy.
hot Stuff.
I didn't-- I
up to me, I'd shoot your sorry ass.
unfortunately, it's not, so I have to protect you, because your best friend might be on her way here to kill you.
now... what's this book about?
I took another look at Vanessa's file.
the evidence just wasn't sitting right with me.
how so?
the GSR on Vanessa's hands.
trace of
forensics found trace amounts all over the deck, but the largest concentration? On Vanessa's cosmetics.
so either Vanessa shot her husband and then put on eye shadow...
or the gunshot residue was planted.
what's the name of the witness who helped the police find the gun?
he works at the marina where the Watkins kept their yacht.
I'll have a talk with him.
nice boat.
even for people with a place in Tuscany.
who was that man in Washington Heights, in the suit?
look, we're adults.
I don't have to know everything about you, you don't have to know everything about me.
well, I think it's good you're moving on.
excuse me?
from Beecher.
good for you for seeing someone new.
Yeah. Thanks.
I got a fiancee myself.
course, she'd rather elope.
well, me, I want the blow-out party, all my friends and family there.
your fiancee, she from a big family?
no, she's not real close to her folks.
probably why she doesn't want the big party.
Thanks, Carter.
no problem.
did you talk to your contact at Interpol?
the yacht the Watkins owned-- valued at 5 mil, but get this.
it's leveraged to the hilt and about to be repossessed by the lender, a shell corporation that belongs to a mobster.
Jeremy Watkins owed a mobster $5 million?
at least.
all of Jeremy's accounts were in the red, except for one, a charity by the name of "Innocence Now.
innocence now
where is this account based, Detective?
greenwich, Connecticut.
I guess I'm going to Greenwich. - If you wouldn't mind.
I'm sure Ms. Shaw has had enough Chardonnay and Nabokov for one afternoon.
I'll have her join you.
Mr. Reese, Jeremy Watkins was deeply in debt to an organized crime affiliate.
it's entirely possible that they killed Jeremy.
if they knew he would never pay, they could have killed him to send a message to Vanessa.
Yes, Pay up or else!
ms. Watkins is beginning to look more and more like a victim, although I can't explain why a victim would procure such a large amount of cocaine.
I think I can.
I just found the witness against Vanessa.
Scott Rawlins. Perhaps he dumped the gun that killed Jeremy.
were you able to ask him about the planted evidence?
no, because someone just planted evidence on him.
Finch, the cops just arrested Scott Rawlins for possession with intent to sell.
had a brick of cocaine identical to the one Reginald gave Vanessa.
she planted drugs on the witness against her to discredit him.
exactly what I would have done.
in that case, I still can't speak to whether she's a victim or a perpetrator.
but Vanessa can.
she stuck around to admire her own work.
frame a man up, then steal his car to get away.
you're good, Vanessa.
we need to talk.
I just spoke to Mr. Reese. They're 15 minutes away.
are you sure this is a good idea?
it seems to me, the best way to start would be to ascertain
ms. Watkins' guilt or innocence in the death of her husband.
from there, we can attempt to figure out the current situation.
ms. Shaw were here, she'd be willing to wager double or nothing that Vanessa's the threat.
so Vanessa's guilty, we turn her over to a corrupt cop who might be trying to kill her?
and if she's innocent, we let her go free, at which point, she may still be trying to kill somebody.
we need to figure out which flawed plan is best.
I can help with that.
what the hell is going on?
who are you people?
as of this moment, Ms. Watkins, we are your judge and jury.
you're here to make your argument.
I can name at least three felonies you're committing.
kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, coercion!
why should I make my argument to you?
because if we decide that you're innocent of your husband's murder, we can provide you with an alternate identity and a fresh start in a new city.
if you're guilty, we turn you over to the NYPD.
I remember you.
you worked Homicide.
NYPD is full of dirty cops.
don't have to tell me that.
but I don't think you're one of them.
so this trial you want to have...
I'm game.
surveillance footage clocked our fugitive getting into this SUV approximately 80 minutes ago.
she's got a friend, male. Appears to be wearing a suit.
plate readers are on the lookout for the car.
set up a perimeter around the marina. Close off the bridges.
find anyone who's seen them, talked to them, thought about them, now!
your husband's blood on the deck, GSR on your hands
and on my cosmetics.
you read the police report.
I swiped a copy from Cameron's desk on my way out of the station.
wouldn't you?
probably.
my husband wasn't murdered. He drowned.
someone planted that evidence and framed me.
prove it.
I'm the Defense.
burden of proof lies with you.
you can object. - Fine, I object.
overruled.
I found this in Scott Rawlins' locker.
when you planted the drugs? - Yes.
$50, 000. A marina guard doesn't make that in a year.
someone paid him to plant the evidence, tell the police where to find that gun.
the same person who is framing me.
you have no chain of custody for that money. It could have come from anywhere.
you used to put bad guys away.
then you married a defense attorney, one notorious for helping murderers walk.
why'd you switch sides like that? Was it the money?
my first murder trial, I was a wreck.
rehearsing every night in the mirror, picturing the jury in their underwear, all the old tricks.
I was winning...
until the defendant hired new counsel. Jeremy.
he trounced me.
but he was kind afterwards.
told me I had grit.
he wouldn't have let Cameron hunt me down like this.
Jeremy would have protected me.
he wasn't protecting you when he ran up all that debt to a mobster.
but now that he's dead, that life insurance policy will wipe out all his debt, and you'll finally be in the black.
Jeremy and I had a living trust.
that agreement stipulates that if he died under suspicious circumstances,
I wouldn't see a penny, and I won't.
everything is going to our charity.
innocence Now.
are you a cosigner on that account, Ms. Watkins?
I might be. I...I don't know.
Jeremy took care of all the paperwork.
if Jeremy took care of all the paperwork, how did you know about the debt?
I found a threatening note on my car, a few nights before Jeremy died.
we were supposed to be having a romantic dinner, but I confronted Jeremy on the yacht.
we argued.
I went below deck to just clear my head.
when I came back up, Jeremy was gone.
the last thing I said to my husband was
I was sorry that we ever got married.
but I didn't mean it, and I didn't kill him.
you have to believe me.
welcome to Connecticut
uh, what was the account name again?
innocence Now.
that's not my password, now is it?
Yeah.
detective, would you be able to tell me if Ms. Watkins is a cosigner on the Innocence Now account?
not yet. They do things a little slow here in Greenwich.
Oh, that's not good.
the little wheel's spinning.
I'll just, uh, restart.
I gotta go.
even for you, stabbing a senior would be a new low.
you don't know that.
the Innocence Now account had a balance of just over $20 million yesterday, but it was transferred into an external account this morning, by the cosigner.
you got a copy of this cosigner's ID?
your husband was having an affair.
even without the money, you had motive.
in most cases, I'd agree with you.
why not in this one?
because I had an affair too.
ms. Watkins, we found no evidence that would confirm that statement.
I have a second email.
his name was Colin. He was a doctor.
but I...I broke it off with him.
email correspondence appears to corroborate your story.
Jeremy and I were struggling this past year.
he was busy with work, he had a purpose, and I was lost.
I wasn't the person he married.
I knew he'd found... other women, but enough was enough. I...I broke it off with the doctor.
Jeremy swore he was through with his indiscretions.
we...we were on the yacht to rekindle our relationship.
so you thought one romantic dinner on a yacht would fix your problems?
no, but...
we had to start somewhere.
look me in the eye, and tell me you loved him.
tell me you didn't want to tear his face off.
do I look angry to you?
I loved Jeremy.
I still do.
even though he was having an affair with your best friend?
He...What?
even I might consider that justifiable homicide.
I don't understand. I...
Nicole would never do that.
Jeremy would never do that.
I'm sorry, Vanessa, but he did.
plate readers caught the...
give me a ten-block radius.
show any potential witness the BOLOs.
we found the vehicle, let's find the suspects, now!
all units, all units. Suspect vehicle found at 58th and 8th.
they found the car.
we need to decide what to do with Ms.Watkins, soon.
the evidence against her was planted. She dismissed any financial motive.
and Nicole and Jeremy's affair was news to her.
I don't think she killed her husband.
I'm inclined to agree.
reasonable doubt in this case abounds.
should we put it to a final vote?
go ahead. - Innocence Now account was cleaned out this morning.
by Vanessa?
no, the cosigner, Henry Shain. We're sending a photo now.
Henry Shain is Jeremy Watkins.
Vanessa didn't kill Jeremy.
because Jeremy is still alive.
how can Jeremy be alive? I saw his body in the water!
it's easy to make that mistake at night.
he faked his death.
he... framed me.
