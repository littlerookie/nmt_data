jam the warheads! I'm trying.
can't find their frequency. Drop a swallow.
got two left.
damn it. Come on!
Ah. frak! What?
check the scReen ahead. Oh. Guess we found the main fight.
[ beeping ]
missile lock! - We got one left.
[ groans ]
we're hit! Oh. really?
Helo-- Hey!
are you okay? Present!
stay with me.
okay, we have a fuel leak. We have to put down and repairit.
nearest world is Caprica. - Lot of company between us and there.
Yeah.
[ engine DeceleRates ]
so we're cruisin'?
best way to avoid attracting attention.
no power signature. go in a straight line.
unless somebody actually gets close enough to see us, wejust look like a chunk of debRis on the sensoRs.
I think we have enough inertia to make it to Caprica's ionosphere.
then we power up and find a place to land.
nice. Nice thinking there. [ Panting ]
preliminary reports indicate...
a thermonuclear device in the 50-megaton range...
was detonated over Caprica City 30 minutes ago.
nuclear detonations have been reported...on the planets Arilon, Icon,
sagittarian and Geminon.
no Reports of casualties, but they will be high.
how many people in Caprica City alone?
seven million. - Mourn the dead later.
right now the best thing we can do is get this ship into the fight.
yes? Excuse me.
um. one of the passengers has a shortwave wireless.
they've heard a report that Caprica has been nuked.
it has. hasn't it?
Caprica and three other colonies.
I guess I. uh
I should go make an announcement or something.
I'll do it. I'm a member of the political cabinet.
it's my responsibility.
while I'm doing that. I would ask that you...
contact the Ministry of Civil Defense and see what we can do to help.
including the colonies of Caprica. [ PassengeRs Gasp ]
Picon. [ Woman ] Oh, my God.
what about Trevor? What about Geminon?
anything on Geminon? My kids are on Geminon!
okay. stop. stop! Please. stop!
please. I'm trying to reach the government right now to get more information.
in the meantime. we should all be prepared for an extended stay aboard this ship.
so. uh. you. please. and you. uh.
take an inventory of the emergency supplies and rations.
Hey. wait a minute. Who put you in charge?
well. that's a good question.
the answer is no one.
but this is a government ship. and I am the senior government official. so that puts me in charge.
so why don't you help me out and go down into the cargo area...
and see about setting it up as a living space.
everyone else. please. uh-- please try and stay calm. Thank you.
all right. this is the passenger manifest.
are you all right? Yeah. yeah.
my parents moved to Picon two months ago...
to be closer to my sisters and their families...
and their grandkids and
madam Secretary. we've got your comlink.
[ man ] Thank God you're not here, Laura. Thank God.
Jack. I've never seen anything like it.
where is the president? Dust in the air, thousands of people wandering the streets.
where is the president. Jack?
is he alive? I don't know. I think so.
we heaRall kinds of things.
have the Cylons made any demands? Do we know what they want?
no. No contact. I'm pretty sure about that.
has anyone discussed
has anyone discussed the possibility of surrender?
has it been considered? After Picon was nuked.
the president offered a complete unconditional surrender.
the Cylons didn't even respond. - Colonial Heavy 7 98.
where? - [ Beeping ]
what should we do?
uh. copy that. The Cylons have found us.
there's an inbound missile. - Where the hell did our escort go?
this is Apollo to Colonial Heavy 798.
I'm declaring an emergency. Flight systems are off-line.
need assistance.
that's six.
how you comin' on that fuel line? - Almost there.
we'll be airborne pretty soon.
okay, that should do it. Sharon.
grab your side arm.
Helo-- Just stand your ground.
captain. are you all right?
captain. are you all right?
I'm fine.
uh. my name's Aaron Doral. I met you before.
took some publicity photos with you and your father.
what are these things? Electric pulse generators from the Galactica.
Really? That's interesting. Captain. I can't tell you how glad I am to see you.
Oh? Why is that?
personally. I'd feel a lot better if someone qualified were in charge around here.
is something wrong with your pilot? No.
it's just that he's not the one giving orders.
this is. uh-- It's a bad situation. isn't it. sir?
Yes. it is. Right.
what if we transfer the "L " containers from bay three to bay four?
then we would have one. two and three for passengers. Yeah. that's doable.
that's a lot of heavy lifting without dock loaders.
a little haRd woRk is just what the people need Right now.
captain, good to see you again.
likewise. Thanks for the lift. [ Chuckles ] You should thank her.
start the cargo transfer and prep bay three for survivors. - Yes, ma'am.
I'm sorry. Survivors?
as soon as the attack began. the government ordered a full stop on all civilian vessels.
so now we've got hundreds of stranded ships in the solar system.
some are lost. some are damaged. some are losing power.
we have enough space on this ship to accommodate up to 500 people.
and we're going to need every bit of it.
but we don't even know what the tactical situation is out there.
the tactical situation is that we are losing. right. Captain?
right. So we pick up as many people as we can, we try to fiind a safe haven to put down.
captain. I'd like you to look over the navigational charts...
for a likely place to hide from the Cylons.
that's all.
lady's in charge.
that"s as close as you get, okay? Let"s just settle down heRe.
settle down and no one gets hurt.
I've gotta get on board. I'll give you 50. 000 cubits.
we"re not taking money! Sixty thousand!
this isn't a rescue ship. This is a military vessel. and we're not taking money.
[ woman ] Please! You've gotta take my nephew! We are not taking money.

all right. we can take three more people. - Three?
that's the maximum load if we're gonna break orbit.
who chooses the three, you? - No one chooses. No one.
lottery.
everyone gets a number. We put the numbers in a box, take out three.
that's it. No arguing. no appeal. How can we trust you?

Hello! Hi.
I'm not interested in such things.
I don't know what role I should play in the company.
but I just wanna work in a Japanese company.
I am glad to know my fellows.
I decide to remember all files in the employee bulletin by heart to work conveniencely.
the employee bulletin even contains the information of the home members.
it's common to do such jobs in Japanese company.
in this way I can know what drink a sir may want in different time.
such as Fubuki, she want a tea at 9, and a black coffee at 12.
and tea at 15, then a cup of coffee at 19.
mr Omochi is receiving an important delegation.
coffee for thirteen men.
hurry.
you did well!
thank you for inviting us.
please help me with some coffee.
it will be us that invite you next time.
excuse me
sugar of milk?
it's the report of the achievement in these two years.
please
coffee
Where's the girl from?
what's up?
why she speak Japanese?
stop right now!
follow me
our guests are very unhappy.
your job is to fill the coffee.
but you, always try to remind them that you got perfect Japanese
but...
manger
I speak Japanese...
don't talk back!
they are important clients of our company.
how can a secret meeting be held in front of a foreigner that knows Japanese?
you shouldn't speak Japanese any more!
what?
you don't know Japanese at all for now on! Clear?
but just because I know Japanese the company employed me.
it's not fair to me!
it's me, your boss, give the order.
from now on, you don't know Japanese any more.
impossible
no one will obey such order.
you should.
WESTERN people's brains should make more clear.
japanese brains is able to force yourself to forget the language.
at least, dress up your look.
it's the order from your boss.
Undrstand?
I've never been sad like this
it cost me so much to learn Japanese
and in Japan,
it's a shame if I was fired so quick.
how I can follow Mr Saito's order?
if it's wrong that a foreign learns Japanese
why the japanese go to learn French?
what he talked to you?
he ordered me to forget Japanese.
you used Japanese when you held the coffee. right?
I hate Mr Saito.
stupid, idiot.
no. You are wrong.
obviously, you are too kind that you have never seen the bad side.
so, Mr Omochi is also a fool!
mr Omochi is a very very special man.
but he's the vice chairman of the board. We have no way.
can we tell it with chairman Haneda?
what kind of man he is?
Outstanding! Very bright, a nice man.
but I don't think it's a good choice to tell him.
you can only appeal with your dircet boss
that means, it's me.
thank you, Fubuki
I understand.
you can not help me.
what does your name mean?
blizzard.
blizzard!
Fubuki means blizzard?
a great name!
I was born in a blizzard.
Oh
you were born in a beautiful day
the beauty in the sky fell into the earth
there are countless bells in the great Nara city.
how you know I am from Nara?
shukugawa, near the mountain Kabuto.
we are very happy.
both of us are from Kansai.
it's the place where the traditional Japanese heart beats.
also where my heart beats.
I have my happy childhood there.
I was in Kansai before 5 years old.
me too. It's also my hometown.
now go back to work.
I have such good fellow like Fubuki
Fubuki became my port against the blizzard.
I continue serve for the fellows. Polite and careful
but I am still twiddling my thumbs.
I take the job of sending mails without asking anyone else's opinion.
your mail
your mail, Mr shiranai.
your pet Yoshiro is three years old today.
happy birthday.
you made bold to do the job without your boss permission?
the self-assertion is a big mistake!
in afternoon the mailman almost got crazy
he thought that he had already been fired.
I'm really sorry.
it's an ill behavior to rob other's job.
is it?
can I go to applogize?
go back and do your job!
manager?
few of the calendars in office is right
are you tired? The job is boresome.
terrible! I go on with vitamin.
thank you.
it's you that asked me to correct the calendars.
it's not the point.
you, never show again.
you made the stuff scatterbrained.
copy these things.
they departure from the centre.
do it again!
still departure from the centre.
not like this!
what?
how you talk with your boss?
sorry.
but I've always been there. They got no problem.
they shouldn't be like this.
can you see it?
I say yes, it's yes.
you use the copy key? Yes.
let me explain it. You cant use that bacause it will be not enough careful.
but...I would take many hours by this way.
Yes, you got it. You can never do anything well.
finally I completed what Mr Saito required.
it's Mr Saito's golf information.
many senseless and frivolous things.
suddenly the history of Fubuki's family came to my mind.
good evening, I am Mr Tenshi
you take charge of the department of milk product.
Yes, but, you...
Yes, I have to copy these by myself. It's too late.
nobody is in my office.
head yourself
you don't use the copy key?
it's Mr Saito's order.
I understand.
great. I have a plan that has much to do with your country.
you can help me.
do a research?
a Belgian cooperation invented a new way to distill tallow.
I know that. The foreground of defatted tallow is perfect.
so do I.
can you come to meet me tomorrow?
mr Saito asked you to do it again because they departured.
he shouldn't have seen them.
I measured one by one and took many hours just for his golf club.
rules
he's torturing you.
don't worry, I am Ok.
Fubuki...
you are so kind
I am happy you can stand with me.
I need a integrated report. The detailed the better.
you can use Mr saitama's office.
he went on errands.
he's not only among the top at home but also studied abroad by himself
such able man is seldom seen in Japan.
you have the data?
about the new diet habits of Japanese?
Yes, I got.
as you have seen, the consumption of butter is increasing.
patients with adiposity are our market.
it's much better, but still not perfect.
do it again.
amelie, your report is so nice. Very acute.
should I tell them you are the writter in the meeting?
you are helpful for me, do you think Mr Saito will be angry?
oppositely, you will find that...
he will be happy to shake me off.
would you be unhappy?
if I can be the writter of your report
I will not be unhappy at all. It's my honor.
finally I got back my self-confidence.
some days later, my dream broke up.
I saw Mr Tenshi there.
but I don't know what can I do.
I must do something.
you, Tenshi
you just wanna wreck our company
mr tenshi is not what you said! It's me that prompted him.
it's my fault.
you dare to argue? No.
I should be punished.
you dare to protect the malicious woman?
you should not do this.
to punish Mr Tenshi is a big fault.
you said what I said was fault?
you can't imagine the rudeness.
no.
I just pray for you not to blame him.
in fact, you have no excuse.
I really made a big mistake.
but I still wanna stress the good of Miss Amelie's report and the rapid speed of the completion.
it's not the point. It should be Mr saitama's job.
but he has went on errands. So you should wait for him.
not only we but also many other companies wanna take this project.
it would be late if we just wait for Mr saitama's back.
you dare doubt his job?
of course not.
but He don't know French and have never been in Belgium.
Amelie got more advanced qualifications.
shut up!
stupid pragmatism!
it's the production of the western. I am sorry.
I hate such western production.
I am sorry that you've been involved.
no...
I will never forget your kindness in my life.
thank you for your encourage.
but
you should have said that the report was written by me.
I didn't say it.
do you still remember our talk?
I tried to talk with Mr Haneda privately.
the damned bastard!
don't call his name.
don't think in that way.
it's not him that spilled our guts.
I saw the spitball on Mr Omochi's table.
and I know it immediately.
who wrote it?
mr saitama? No.
you really want to know?
sure.
it's Miss Mori's name.
Fubuki?
it's impossible.
I can't believe it.
she wouldn't do such things.
the harm to you is bigger than mine.
you will lose the chance to promote in a long time.
Fubuki is my friend.
yes...
when your job is only to correct the calendars and copy golf rules.
that's why?
why she had to blow upon me?
miss Mori has taken many years to achieve her position
she can't bear that you can be promote only ten weeks after your come.
I cannot believe it.
she's too squalid.
miss Amelie...
do you know if a girl is still single when she's 29 years old in Japan,
what it illustrates?
she has been working hard for seven years.
because she's too busy,
she lost the golden age to get married.
why she aimed at you is deeply from her heart.
I have to talk clearly with her.
you have to do this?
there's no way to solve the problem if we don't communicate.
you talked with Mr Omochi just now and was reviled.
you really believe that it can solve the problem?
there's no way to solve the problem if we don't communicate.
as for me
can I have a talk with you?
I used to think that we are friends. I don't understand
what is up? Can you deny that you blew the gab?
I have no need to deny. I just followed the rules.
the rules are more important than our friendship?
friendship?
so funny.
I won't.
you are defing.
you made a big mistake.
it's strange. You are fond of weasel.
in a country that advocates honor
do you think you are qualified to teach me a moral class?
what do you think is the reason I am willing to talk with you.
I don't know.
for pacification?
OK, apologize to me.
you looks smart.
why can't you understand?
don't be so arrogant.
you are easy to be lassoed.
now you know my anger?
I understand.
if I have the chance,
it won't harm you a bit.
I have been in my position for only one year.
but I had been struggling for it for many years.
you wanna take the same position with me within weeks?
it's the reason.
you wish me to be painful?
infant.
what about you?
do you think you are mature to get the problem grievous like this?
I am your boss.
you dare to say to me so rudely?
I admire you.
I, I am not dissappointed.
I have no respect for you.
you don't change your department, but you will do the fiscal job.
I do the fiscal job?
I'd better to be a player.
accountant, it's meaning is broad.
I don't think you can turn to a accountant.
these are the invoices of last several weeks.
here is the register book of the elevn departments.
an easy job, right?
you sort the invoices by date and department.
then you put the registered invoices in the drawer.
I don't use the computer? No.
mr Unaji will take the invoices each month.
he only needs to repeat your job.
it save a lot of time.
Reming Ltd, what's it?
non-iron metal, in MM department
and what's this?
chemical production, in CP department
curious!
Ahh!
what's up?
GMBH's invoice, the date is...
you said GMBH?
a branch
fool!
in German it means CO. Ltd.
you mixed the irrelevant companies.
do you think we have business deal with all CO. Ltd?
how long can you correct your mistakes?
but the German "GMBH" is very strange
very bold!
you wanna owe your fool to the German mistake?
calm down. I am only not clear about it.
is it? Your country is the neighbor of Germany!
and though we are far far away from it but we still know it.
don't stand there.
what the hell you did?
there are four zeros here. It cannot be worse.
you always add or lessen a zero.
look
how long would you need to correct your stupid mistakes?
too much zeros...
shut up!
I am terribly sorry.
no, you are not really sorry. Do you think you can trick me?
you indeed want to revenge against me.
I swear I don't.
I know you do.
you want me to be mocked because I blew upon you!
it's me that's mocked, not you!
who assigned the job for you? Me.
you are clear that I have to answer to your behaviour.
you show your madcap in western way in spite of our company's interest.
you even destroy the company's accounts for revenge.
I didn't intend to do it. Go.
I know you are not smart enough.
nobody would make such low-class mistakes.
no, no, I... Don't argue any more.
you did intended to do it.
I swear with my honor.
I don't thinke I am that stupid.
maybe.
choose, either a betrayer or a stupid man.
somebody is not good at data.
there's no such man in Japan
who dare disprove the superior in Japan?
if you are a idiot, you should tell us earlier.
I am not.
I wont do this job any more.
a strange idiot.
to copy data don't needs brightness.
the brain will be blunt if you dont inspire it.
you wanna inspire your brightness?
curious!
it's common.
OK.
let me think which job can inspire your brightness.
irrelevant. This job can inspire your brightness.
it's Mr shiranai's cost list.
check it.
it should be calculate in Yen while the invoice is in Mark.
you have to calculate the exchange rate.
don't forget that
the exchange rate changes every day.
you will get used to it.
it's very simple, look.
I calculate the total amount of Mr saitama's cost in Yen.
how many have you completed?
don't forget that it must be completed by the end of the month.
I begin to work now.
the number made me headachy.
the files piled like a mountain.
I got very very tired after only a few files.
my hands began to not to follow my command.
they became soft like the potato mud.
I was doing my job carefully not to make big mistake.
my right hand is already numb.
many...
many......
people in your country is like you?
you are the first Belgian that I've seen.
the Belgian is not like me.
Oh, that's good.
do you think it's funny?
do you know that to call another one idiot is very insulting?
I know.
it's a part of my psychic problem.
I want to apply to stay here tonight.
your brain will get more clever?
I hope so.
OK. One night is enough?
of course not. Till the end of the month.
I did and did without a stop but I got no achievement at the first night.
then
I could not gather my attention here.
I could not be a accountant!
I hated these!
I made countless mistakes
the beauty of Fubuki made me numb.
what are you looking at?
I am thinking that in Japanese "hair" is the same word with "God"
also "paper." Get back to your work.
I am sorry. I am sleepy.
and my name is rain in Japanese.
yours is snow.
mine is rain.
but they're both water in hands.
you take me to compare with you?
what would you wanna be when you are a child?
Toxophily champion.
I am sorry
I am here
I am with you
what are you doing there? What do you want?
don't be angry. I only want to comfort you.
shut up! Get out!
I am late.
miss Mori was galled.
she wants to keep her face and she won't cry before us.
no one has seen her crying.
what you did just now was the most venomous revenge.
add oil!
I have a new job for you. Come with me.
you first.
come in.
all puts here.
lock it well.
use this tool in this way.
any problem?
who I replace to do the job?
nobody.
all the ladies who do such jobs were fired?
no, they just come at night. It's not enough.
once in a while there's no bumf.
or the closestool is dirty.
the infection is not so good.
especially when the guest from outside come.
thanks to you we won't have such troubles.
I wanted to be tough when I was young.
I thought I could bear anything.
I was intending to be a translator in a Japanese company.
however I turned to be a accountant.
and I was considered to be disabled at any aspect.
all these made me tremble with fear.
it's nice to have a job?
soon I found I was antipathetic.
this time I should be fired.
no matter whom.
but it's a exception in Japan.
I signed a one-year contract.
I hoped I could stick it out.
I hope to be a Japanese.
I felt I was humiliating.
I began to doubt my preserve from my childhood.
when I was little the beauty in Japan touched me much.
the feeling was still deeply in my head nowadays.
such rules drove me into another dimensionality beyond imagination.
Fubuki knows my situation clearly.
I must retaliate.
if you want to complain come to me
I am not complaining
miss Amelie...
again, the outstanding Tenshi found a very pretty method to help me.
to express his discontentment for my punishment
he incited men in the 44th floor not to go to the toilet.
I thank Mr Tenshi very much.
besides, the movement indeed brought many inconvenience to the men in the company.
misters had to go to the toilet downstairs.
the stuff wasted their work time.
it's not a little business in Japan.
it would considered to be lazy.
two tooch-brush every day.
she thought it can daunt me in this way.
but I was still excited.
nasty, racialism
two targets stared at each other, filled with animosity.
gradually
few man came to the man's toilet of the 44th floor.
misters don't dare to the toilet in this floor.
they pay much more time to other floors.
your being let them feel embarrassed.
I am not playing here. Don't chicanery.
if you have a little self-pride, it won't be like this.
how I can have self-pride in that place?
if you stare at the misters just like how you are staring at me now,
their attitudes are reasonable.
take easy. I won't pull you in.
I never stare at them.
then, why don't they go there?
it's Ok.
they feel nervous when a woman is beside them.
how don't you draw the conclusion?
what conclusion? Never be on the scene.
I keep away from the man's toilet?
Oh, thanks.
I've never said it.
I don't know whether the man's toilet is empty or not.
at least...
what?
you should set a video-camera in the man's toilet
then when I in the woman's toilet I can get the situation in the other side.
a camera in toilet?
you don't use your head?
if Misters don't notice it
shut up
you are really a fool.
if you give the job to...
are you answering me?
you cannot put me to a lower position.
take care.
you cannot imagine
what will happen.
tell me
you, be careful.
there's still few men that came to the man's toilet
the toilet downstairs that they often went still had lots of people.
the method I treat against authority works abroad.
it also work in other places. But in my company it didn't work.
the refused to express and only to obey
you cannot have any opinion.
the only thing you have to do is to repect your boss and obey their orders.
besides, I am thinking
if the company could employ some foreigners in some important jobs, it would be of much good.
I happened to quit the job.
it should be have a better solution.
this time I could deeply taste the feeling Fubuki had for the last time.
now I also suffered.
it would be nice if I have a privilege.
so I can made the choice again.
several months
I even completed the job what the toilet cleaners should do.
it helped me to be determined.
I won't sign the contract any longer.
I decided to follow the tradition.
I must talk clearly with every boss.
of course the first one is Fubuki.
it's the last chummy talk between us.
no bumf, no bumf.
have you seen the movie "Furyo"?
Yes.
you like it? The music is great.
but it's a pity that it's not a real story.
I think it's metaphor.
metaphor about what?
the relationship with others.
for example you and me.
we have also similar relations between us.
just like sakamoto and his prisoner David Bowie.
the differences between the east and the west.
you are not like David Bowie.
my contract expires.
I want to tell you that
I am sorry
I cannot continue to sign.
Ah, why?
the company gave me many opportunities to prove my ability.
I will be grateful forever.
but I can't achieve my anticipative goal.
right.
what do you think?
I have no the ability of the intellectual.
WESTERN people's brains are not as good as Japanese's.
it indeed exists, but it should not be overdrew.
coarseness
you don't find that you have some bugs with your brain?
sure.
at the begining, I thought you would try to destroy.
swear that you are not intended to be so silly.
I swear.
have you realized your disadvantage?
Yes.
the company help me realize them.
so
the company gave you a lot of help.
to the company until I die.
now what's your plan?
I want to teach French.
you, to be a teacher?
do you think it's Ok?
you are right.
I have not realized that my ability is limited.
certainly.
what job can you do in fact?
do you think the only job I can do is to pick rubbish?
Oh, yes.
my contract expires.
I want to tell you that I am sorry.
I cannot continue to sign.
the company gave me many opportunities to prove my ability.
Errr...
what are you talking about?
I am really sorry
as fro...
but...
mr Saito, You are nothing!
do you have your plan?
don't worry, I will find a good job.
miss Amelie!
my contract expires.
I want to tell you that
I am sorry
I cannot continue to sign.
chocolate!
it's pawpaw chocolate.
it's Hokkaido's speciality. Very nice!
authentic japanese flavor.
here, try.
no thanks.
do me some favor.
no thanks.
eat! No!
eat! No!
you are still in contract.
why do you want me to have chocolate?
too arrogant! Obey!
give me
delicious!
chocolate from Mars. Is it good?
the company gave me many opportunities to prove my ability.
I will be grateful forever.
but I cannot achieve my anticipative goal.
miss Amelie!
be seated.
I am listening.
my contract expires.
I want to tell you that
I am sorry
I cannot continue to sign.
of course, I understand.
I will be grateful forever.
but I cannot achieve my anticipative goal.
it's not like this.
you are outstanding with Mr Tenshi.
you are just unlucky.
you came here not at a right time.
I allow you to leave.
but...if one day you change your mind,
please come back.
I am sure I am not the only one that will express the regret to your leaving.
thank you for your efforts. Thank you.
night, February 7th
I felt is a very difficult thing to say byebye to Fubuki.
when I thought back how stupid I was at that time.
help her with some documents in advance, considering to make some mistakes.
the window is the bound that links the sky and the truth.
it stands for freedom
I flied far far away from here
therefrom I came back to my country.
Belgium.
february 14th, 1991
I began with my first novel.
feb 17th, I joined the anti-Iraq war pageant
feb 18th, in the other side of the planet, Fubuki was 30 years old.
her husband stands beside her.
my first novel was published in 1992
it made me very happy.
it's from Fubuki who write it in Japanese.
Amelie
congratulations...
Fubuki Mori

without doubt, these figures messure up
just small discrepancy
it will rain 40 days and 40 nights after plenilune
that's tomorrow night!
the rain will pour down, water in the rivers rises
soon it will go up to the bank
then it will be the terrible flood
water continues to go up
do you hear?
that's another Niagara
my god
who wants the last egg cookie? I eat enough
me, too
so do I, thank you, Juliette
can you play guitar for us? Good idea
just like last time, let me digest first
no, now, grandpa!
you will sleep later
grandpa!
play, Ferdinand
so they can sleep
you two want me to play for you?
let me sing "old sea house" for you
we left Porto Rico in the evening of Saint-Malo
there was 8 people in the ship
our leak tub
tides up, tides down
what do we take?
barrels of Rum and bags of Coco
we set off from San Diego
straits is low and plain
do you hear?
they, they have no other way
damn
they are dying, like others
we can warn them
how can they trust us? We are just frogs
look, Tom! Grandpa's enemy
who are they?
potato pesticide Why does one ride on another?
they are making love. Can't you see?
what's "make love"? I'm not your sex abecedarian
ask your mother, go, wait!
brave! My beetle
I still have feeling, I'm not dead
do you wound? No, I'm alright
well done. What did you say?
well done, I want to...
can you speak? Are you surprised?
Yes, a bit
let's talk about something else. Wait, little guy
I have something important to tell you
I don't believe! A speaking frog?
wait! Come back!
I told you, it's no use
stop! Tom, don't be silly
come on, you will see it
they can speak, I heard them talking
poor Tom
speak, or she will regard me as cheater
OK, we speak, listen
do I cheat you? No, they can speak
listen!
it's nothing
catastrophe is coming
the following 40 days and nights
flood? Yes, flood
it's no difference for us, but you...
if you don't act fast, you all will die
die? We dp, so do you and other people
flood will drown animals, forests and farms...
it will drown all the city, the toppest mountain
is it drown the sky?
Yes, drown the sky
everything drown No time
what shall we do?
Oh, I have no idea
can you help us?
sorry, we can't, we are just frogs
but we can forecast weather
hurry, I can't help you
now it's your problem
we must tell grandpa, come on, Tom!
come on! Don't hide here
grandpa!
mom! Juliette
you are safe!
we succeed!
anger of heaven quiets down
I don't know you, but...
you said!
when shall we eat? I'm hungry 40 days isn't long, who believes it, captain?
Roger that! We look after you
don't expect any miracle
but things on the tub can help us get through it
let's wait for it, stand aside!
be careful!
how is it?
28 tons of potato!
potato! Potato!
incredible, we are saved in such a tub
can we eat the potato the old man mentioned?
of course, I like it most
but I'm so hungry that I can eat a brick now
if you say so
Ah, nausea!
you should make it cooked! You cooked it and then eat?
which cave do you dig?
if someone ask, you don't know
OK, Ok, Ok, lumme
do you see the two bacons behind us?
am looking
I'm thinking what will they react to it
we certainly should pay attention to them
excuse me, captain
herbivore like potato, they are happy
but for us, carnivore, how could we eat potato?
is there anything for us on the menu?
I'm thinking about the problem. Let me think
sheep are shivering in front of wolves
when cats prey, rats shiver
creeping animals like to eat hoptoads
they live together
it's not easy
everything must be changed or our lives will be deteriorated
if you don't oppress your aspirations then we no longer exist
we can't survive
if you don't oppress your aspirations
for carnivore, it's natural
to eat Herbivore
it's standard rule
if you deny, you are madman
before the flood
it's unblamable
but now everything must be changed Or lives will die out
we can't survive
wait, captain!
you mean we can't eat meat?
nor a piece of chicken?
nor a piece of chicken!
I know potatoes are difficult for you, but it's the only way
we all need to survive
be patient
blood won't last long
we are the only survivors, just like Noah's Ark?
I'm not clear, I can't see anything else
if nobody remains on the earth, whom will you marry with?
I won't tell you even if I know the answer
you are so...
I know whom I will marry with
there is something strange there
where? A black thing on the water
you are right
a wood or something
no, wait chelonian! Are you sure?
a large chelonian!
I go to tell grandpa!
hurry, she is in the wrong direction
what's up? She saw chelonian
grandpa! Tom! Hurry
she grasps the life buoy!
I bet they will get it on the ship
what's up? You know!
you are allergic to chelonian, by the way
can't you move there?
it's fine there! How can I?
no space
if that's your opinion I just explain it
don't you see I'm blocked? What a bad mood are you today!
I'm sorry
I think we are too late
poor grandpa, is she really dead?
look...
she has no film
somebody attacked her
little chelonian, open your eyes
open your eyes
she isn't dead, she is still alive
she is still alive
stand aside
give her some fresh air
where am I? We save you You are in our ship
what's matter with you?
crocodile...
everywhere
I just left
I'm too tired
can't you see she is hungry?
bring her something to eat, come on
you saved me
let her stay alone She need rest
when shall we find the continent, grandpa?
no one can tell
it takes some time to absorb the water
I hate this. So do I
I can't wait the absorbability
can't you try some spells, Juliette?
I like it, but never use it
a falling star, make a wish, Tom
I know, I hope flood retreat earlier
idiot, it's no use when you say it out
where does falling star come from?
you know it, my child
space is not empty
there are many gravels and rocks floating around the earth
some are large, others are small
they are called meteorite
sometimes
when the earth cross them
falling stars are very fast
they rush to the space, abrade and fire
just like a match
so they radiate? Smart child...
no, these falling stars have a secret
billions years ago
when the first falling star cross the universe arrive in our planet
some strange things happened
just like space is making love with the earth
these maculas were produced
bring us the first seed
that's how it begins
we are all off springs of the great falling star
are you feeling better?
Yes, I come back
we shouldn't leave you alone like that
you are so kind, dear, how old are you?
me? I'm 9
and you?
you are very old, aren't you?
not too old what are they talking about, mom? No...
they are talking about me
don't be nervous, I will cut your ears
done
you can go now
don't look at these foxes
just look at him when he passes by
in low rock
whose claws is the strongest?
it's us, carnivore
who are the gangsters in the ground? The guys over there
calm down
who can provide it to you?
all the tigers and men
is it you, Tom? Yes
where is Lili? She has new friend
she doesn't play with me any more
sometimes, girls need a space for themselves
they need to talk about something we don't care about
my god! It's so small
the sky is low
pass me the two-handed hammer.
here you are, Grandpa
thanks
come in, ok?
where, now still
breakfast is ready, come and eat!
potato again
only potato
can I eat yours? Be my guest!
nor do you
what's the matter?
we all have potatoes
are you just wasting them?
you all do that, I can't believe it
I just don't believe it
I really don't believe it
as you know, after all, they are only carnivore...
carnivore maybe not
they do according to what we said or we all eat
be happy, Lili So are you
the potatoes are so delicious
my ancestor...
what are she doing? Want to become a bake meat
spirit of the earth
small potato...
she just cries Is that bake meat?
curse
wrong again
I really don't know why It never works
I just have no power
usually it's so funny...
when your magic is wrong
don't laugh at me
it was useful at my grandma's time
I feel your way of doing it
I hate crocodile too
they kill all my family
I'm the last survivor
look! That's what I remain
three small eggs
I took them away
before the damned crocodile eat them
it's really a nightmare
these food make them mad
destroy all the movable things
even if there is human on the ship
really horrible, they are mad
really incredible, I decide to go away
luckily, I find a life buoy
you know those news
some people are still on the ship
my papa! My mom!
what's up?
I see
I know your feeling
cry
come on, cry , Lili
many people died of the flood
maybe we are just wandering survivor
but... I think...
poor little thing, poor us
I feel too bad
come on, come on...What have we become?
don't cry in front of the children
come on, we talk about it in another place
Louise...Lini...They are all kind people
what remains in our world?
what do we have, what will we dream of?
nothing! Nothing
you can't say that, the world won't end
just think for a while...
how long will our nightmare be?
1 year, 10 years, 100 years!
no one can tell it
time is lapsing
but I believe, one day
the flood will go away
flood goes away, then our lives restart
are you sure? No
I can't ensure anything
Yes, I can ensure one thing
that is: I love you forever
our lives will never end
Roger?
have you ever thought of...?
sometimes, in the morning
what do you think of? Death, idiot!
death...
why do you want me to think now?
do you hear they said we are the only survivor
the only survivor?
what do you think it is after someone is dead?
after death?
how could I know? What a question! I'm not soldier!
make sure those things Say, flood retreats...
flood retreats? It's over then!
what do you mean?
we are waiting
what can I say? Nothing!
I just say, flood retreats
when you find something funny, tell me
isn't the flood retreat funny?
Oh, my head...
when shall we go to the same ship as the idiot stays?
what did I do?
is that a problem? No, I find out
you know, my parents are dead, too
I was too young
I think it was in a war
I can't remember now
anyway he adopted me
I knew his parents They were in the same ship as his father
so Juliette and I decided to adopt the little sailor
will you adopt me?
do you remember we have promised to your parents to look after you we will keep the promise
will you keep the promise, too, Grandpa?
I look after all the people who call me Grandpa
it's my honor
even if I hope these people don't call me like that
ferdinand, seems your family is becoming larger
I use the rear teeth to eat these potatoes
they burn like fires in my stomach
I feel so terrible!
do you want your stomach to continue aching?
you will die without meat There are many on the tub
nobody will miss one or two chick
no matter who are you, you forget one thing...
that's the rule of captain
we have no right Who do you think are you?
can he change the natural law?
when do you see that carnivores don't eat meat?
shut up!
pass me a piece of barbecue
better half-cooked
do you think can you? Of course, see my great work
engine's power will drive the shovels
then we can move!
am I smart?
at that time, it is a real ship! Real one
my papa is deft, too?
he is the high-class mechanical
compare with him, I'm an outsider
I always see on the bridge
but he is already with engine
he is very familiar with his things
he can disassemble a engine in minutes
help!
what's the matter?
don't do that! Let me go!
what's the matter?
they want to eat her!
let her go right now!
my hoof, I can't beat them
ain't you mad? Ain't you crazy?
I really can't believe! You want to destroy each other?
no, captain Do you know why, we are hungry!
we need meat, that's it
deep fry potato...We can't afford it
whatever. Do you need pea to improve your intelligence?
we lived through relying on miracle
now you want to destroy anything!
want to destroy our chance of survival!
unless I'm dead!
enough!
we've got so many troubles I will put you into prison in the tub
be careful of your leg, too
I hate you! You are ruffians, selfish people
who let me lose it? He should pay for it
they will rebel
the space is much larger now. Are you dreaming?
I'm not dreaming How could you say that? Idiot
I do say you are dreaming How can?
my god! Don't speak, you make me nervous!
poor guy, you are scared
I never scare
the appearance of grandpa is in time. Right
I will lose my life if it's late
these bastards! We need to be care of them
little goat, set your teeth
are you ok? Yes
I'm more lucky than you I've heard about your parents
Yes, they are dead
like others
when shall we attack?
be careful! You can't badger with captain
let me get rid of him first
do you still remember what are we looking for?

they bring you in, Bernard
we meet in their home and love each other there
isn't that meatless?
of course not
I never guess
do you know what do I bring?
do you assume they treat your cat like that, too?
Yes...No...
you are right
for centuries, human has persecuted us
we tortoises
they hunt up our shell our eggs, our body and meat
look, what remains in my arm?
we are cut bit by bit
day after day, then head...
before crabs and gnawer see bird eat us up...
we suffered for weeks like a live food warehouse
all the family died
so that they can use our shell to make combs
we endure it silently
we don't say a word
we all shut up our mouths
but it's over
over
flood makes my dream come true
listen to the curse:
revenge
I will kill you all
all of you
with flashlight...
crocodile will come, too
no one will survive
perfect weapon
my small nuclear bomb
I'm really sorry about you
one more thing...
eggs
they are not mine
they are crocodiles'
they are crocodiles' last ones
these idiot can't lay eggs in the water
they need dry earth
the flood makes no dry earth
I stealed their last eggs
they will vanish forever

hope Basti go to heaven! What's that?
that's our barn! Our ship
attention
here
here
they are ramming toward us
I can't hold any more, you are too heavy
what do you see downside?
they are behind us
I can't grasp it, the ship shakes too much
it will explode
it's bad. We've found the reason
party is here
continue, crocodiles
now they are all yours It's they who steal your last eggs
your children, your offspring
Falderal
you are here now, of course you will lie
to fool you
think a way out, she needs help
you know I'm allergic to tortoise
I can't believe
that's what you are worrying about? Called pachyderm?
OK! obey you If I have spots, don't complain
your eggs are all here I can help you find them
but at first, eat up all the dog meat in the ship
let me go, you idiot! Let me go my shell

nonsense! They are my eggs
they come from my ovary
I'm the mother
don't you see? She has penis
she is male
she cheats us!
Yes, actually, for tortoise...
male tortoises lay eggs
impossible. Only female can lay eggs that's girl's job
think other things Guy. It's impossible
she just want to deal with us! Wait
I can explain Then explain
OK, female tortoises lay eggs
but my situation is...

how could we do others? You are beyond redemption!
who gives you the power?
come on, tell me are you judge?
death penalty? Come on, explain to me!
they are right, let it be
don't do that, it's complicated enough
you idiots, look at yourselves
your answers are just brutality and violence
what do you get from it? A cut of slug?
you are nothing!
captain, what do we want to say is... sorry
we don't know what's wrong with us
your apology is the last thing I need
do you know who are you? Yes
pilgarlic You are weak!
consider it for yourself!
look, how fool you are! make all the things messy!
thanks god, nobody dies!
actually...
what? Actually?
the chicken problem...
which problem? Which chicken?
we are very hungry... I don't believe
I don't believe! abhorrent!
you really bring the cookie What else can I say?
what can I say?
I have nothing to say I have nothing to say!
there are not many people on the ship
now we won't see hen, cock, chick and eggs any more
our chances of living become smaller and smaller
life is weak
we need each other How can we let them believe this?
it's that chelonian, papa she is evil
she actually is very evil
she feed crocodiles with us She said it's revenge
nothing can prove revenge is right
seems they are crazy!
when you light up the fire of violence...
you never know how to extinguish it He isn't wrong!
it's a worse thing Thanks
don't forget this forever, children
do you see the trailer, papa?
I could drive it very well before You are smart
I am also good without your help

good night, papa
Papa...it's the second time

I must get used to it

my lovely son
when the sun rises from my sail
morning wind blows on my face gently
telling me a beautiful...
tale of sea sailor
if I have a son...
a lovely boy to cherish, that will be so good
if I have a son...
a child who lives for love
a child who lives for love we get along with each other, don't we, Lili?
Yes, Tom Whom will you marry with?

Brown-skinned.

his rituals.
She...she
her!
passion runs loose
the Virgin of Holy Lust
she Kill Franco...
franco must be killed.
don't walk over the mopped part.
a while ago a damn whore muddied up the hall.
it ain't fair...
Where's Gardenia?
they told me he was here.
I gave them a big wad of bills so they'd tell me.
get out of here.
if you're found here, I'll get heat.
how'd you stay in here?
and Gardenia? -You were told wrong.
whores only pass through here before working.
no, no, not this one, It's the boss's.
he marks the level. He notices everything.
his name's Gardenia,
don't play dumb.
the masked wrestler? -Exactly...
you're after a sissy?
a faggot, well, a queer.
I say it because it's common knowledge:
when he enters the ring, he wears braids and a little girl's dress.
that sissy you're talking about, fucked me like no one ever has.
never before, not now, never again.
so much so that I won't forget him.
I have him stuck to my pussy, and to my heart.
for once...
for once I get here early and I'm given a nasty surprise.
phony, fraud, hypocrite...
how well you pretend when I get here later.
you gave her my aged brandy.
I smell it, idiot, I smell it.
one who was born with a siIver spoon in his mouth, has a fine sense of smell.
Solera de la Reina's your favorite.
your fucking mother is my favorite...
my favorite...is the brandy that I say is my favorite.
you told me your favorite was... -Shut your trap.
shut it, you damn bastard, phony, son of a bitch, half-breed.
you're such a peasant.
and if she threw up...
you're both going straight to jaiI.
Yeah, accused of stealing and...
and embezzlement.
Embezzlement? -Embezzlement, idiot...
embezzlement and anything else I feel like.
if you want to vent your anger, I'll give you the excuse.
I'll just throw up on you.
that way you take it out on me since I deserve it.
he's got nothing to do with it. -Come here you.
don't just stand there.
don't go. Come here.
come here.
let go! Bastard!
get in there!
lock it. -Open the door.
let me out!
I just found her here. -I know.
when will you ever have the dough for a foreign whore?
then why do you take it out on me?
I pay you, I take it out on you.
but look...
I'm calm, I'm calm, so I won't take it out on you.
mop the brandy stain...with soapy water.
if not, it'll dry out and stink badly.
the Ofelia is a cafe for conversation and cultured people.
what about her? -I'll screw her...
with the police? -No, for real.
she can pay the bribe with two blowjobs.
better yet, I'll talk to Immigration.
they're serious people.
she'll be in Salina Cruz tomorrow.
destination: China.
listen, Don Lazaro -And you know why?
for being a republican.
they love to be martyrs but as far as working, forget about it.
this one must have left Spain when she smelled defeat, and came running.
get dressed!
she's just odd.
how do you know she's Spanish?
because I'm Spanish. I have the same blood.
you were born here. -Yeah, yeah, I was born here, but my blood's from there.
OK, enough chitchat.
know what?
one day I'll throw this damn ball in the garbage.
this is a cafe, not a dive. Why are you staring at it?
I look at it and it feels like Christmas.
the Indian's become a poet.
no wonder Cortez bought your souls with trinkets and glass.
shiny things dazzle you.
damn fatso, you have Indian blood just like me.
real Indian blood.
the boss is a real bastard.
he's calling Immigration.
he doesn't mess around and he's set on it.
says it's because you're a republican and he supports Franco.
I want to see Gardenia.
that's all I want. To see Gardenia.
that he see me die.
that way, I'll be stuck in his memory.
and he'll love me a little, just a bit.
don't let me leave without Gardenia, without getting him in my soul.
life's funny...
to come to die in a garbage pit, fucking life.
fucking truth, huh?
because I'm going to die in this pit, stuffed with opium and booze.
the Chinese revenge.
the yellow danger.
touch, touch, touch...
feel my death.
a death that caught me without him, without Gardenia,
without his cock...
tell fatso that I'm dying.
that I'm dying here on him...
to fuck up his life, -to give him bad Iuck. -Be quiet.
you're dying, but you don't shut your mouth.
get out of here.
if Immigration comes, the least they'll do is deport you.
they enjoy what they do to women.
to die somewhere else...
as it should be.
each with his own sorrow...
thanks anyway.
go to 210...
it's a door with white glass.
stay there untiI your soul settles.
what if it leaves me?
if you feel bad, talk to Raquel. She's next door.
she'll take over.
tell her I sent you.
are you bringing me Gardenia, Nacho?
anything you want, but go upstairs.
because in cases like this, Don Lazaro warns and delivers.
anything?
anything I ask of you?
you'll give me anything I ask for?
now you're trapped.
didn't I tell you that life's a bitch?
it's a bitch, and it's fucked, like it should be.
I told you. It's fixed.
excuse me...
he already made a deal, the guys are going to have a surprise.
of course. -No doubt there was money invoIved...
it's post time.
I'm treating Senator Horcasitas and his friends.
bring my brandy, the one from the decanter.
to your health. -Thanks, Don Lazaro.
half rum, half Brandy.
all cats are grey in the decanter.
Hey!
Where's your jacket? -It's stained.
that sIut? Who else could it be?
serve this and get another one.
can't go through life reaping pity.
did you call the police?
what?
do I look like an informer or a son of a bitch?
go on.
excuse me...
there, little girl...
there.
there... calm down...
you'll look for him?
you'll bring me Gardenia?
she won't be a burden.
I left her sleeping.
she won't wake untiI tomorrow.
she's sick.
sick, that's what they call sloshed now.
I'm not mixing in your affairs.
they're full of bad habits.
you're leaving?
what if the police comes looking for you?
I'm hungry...
and all you could think of was locking me up.
some skinny-ass came with smeared shit for me to eat.
she said, "Eat like us or starve"
I've never starved, not for her nor anyone else.
so I said, let's go out and eat like people do.
don't like chilies. They burn my throat.
come here.
come here.
my boss has things that you'll like.
he's your countryman.
come on!
have some bread. -No.
I prefer tortillas.
the world is wide and strange...
and tastes shatter types, and he isn't my countryman.
you...talk like a Spaniard. -Yes, but I'm not.
I lived there. Accents come easy.
good with accents, no way.
you'd talk like here.
how do you think Don Lazaro talks with us in the kitchen?
like here.
he's who he is...
and I'm who I am.
feels like Christmas,
one of those nights when you expect presents, and you shut up in the kitchen to eat.
you eat to make the night shorter, or to sleep in, if there weren't any gifts.
when there were no gifts,
I'd get into bed and close my eyes.
I'd swallow my tears and say, today isn't today.
today is tomorrow, and that was it.
all soIved.
as if I'd had gifts, pudding, everything.
did I tell you I lived in a big house when I was small?
aImost a palace?
a Russian palace.
you'd love it.
I'm Russian.
I'm a countess...and a revoIutionary.
what happened to the palace?
the revoIution happened.
first the Mensheviks, then the BoIsheviks and everyone else.
I drove them wild. They adored me.
I was the toast of Berlin.
the most desired woman in Germany.
you were Russian.
practically German.
I was raised there.
I was a circus performer.
I rode a Cossack horse in the famous Petroff Circus.
bareback and naked.
I moved to trapeze in Berlin.
a siIver trapeze with diamonds.
I was naked.
that's my trademark.
the plot was hatched there.
I, who'd been raised in a summer house in San Sebastian, with an English nanny and a private beach in la Concha, had to go kill Franco.
I was betrayed when I got to BiIbao.
and go figure,
I wound up here, in Veracruz.
kill Franco...
coming or not?
what are you looking at?
what are you looking at?
am I a monkey...a circus freak?
how long have you been there? Hours?
I've respected you. I swear I've respected you.
respected? Don't respect me, as you say. I don't need it.
I don't need it nor do I like it.
I don't care if I do you for a breakfast or someone else for spare change.
you see?
I'm wet.
I get wet from everything and everyone.
go on...
that way I repay you and we're even.
I don't like owing people favors.
no, not like this.
then how the hell?
smell...
it smells like sex, right?
with you or some other guy.
I'm like that, and I like it that way.
and don't look at me with that lousy face.
throw me out, get rid of me while you can.
later, it'll be too late.
I'll have no choice but to break your soul.
that's how I am, and that's how you are.
I'm eviI and a whore, you're an idiot and poor.
Oh well, what can you do?
you asked for it.
you asked for it.
lick it.
you notice nothing.
she's brainwashing you.
I can smell it... don't play dumb.
did you take sulfanimide?
take some. Don't be a nerd.
they may pretend to appear virginal but they're all worse than a bitch in heat, and have crabs in the crotch.
before you go and have sow your oats,
before you go and sow your oats,
who'd of thought it?
and I had you down as a faggot.
just the dress?
and the Spanish tiara?
don't tell me you couldn't find it.
no doubt to save a couple of measly cents.
I brought you this.
what about the blood sausage from Burgos that I told you about?
he noticed stuff missing.
screw the greasy fatso.
my hair, like this or down?
if I had a Spanish tiara...
but you didn't get one.
I wore it like that in Bangkok.
did I tell you about Bangkok?
I was carrying the ransom money.
I had it tied to my dress.
a Chinese dress like this, purple.
that explains the whim. I got nostalgic and asked you for it.
I'll tell you. You'll love it.
it's a really, really long story.
long, long...
if I tell you, it'll be untiI eight or eight thirty a. m.
behave and you'll know my life.
it's like having all of me.
I'll tell you...
but no nodding off.
I work tomorrow.
fuck work.
it's work that's got you trapped in this tiny, shitty world.
look what I'm going to do, look.
I'm going to help free you.
look, your slave's jacket.
I free you, I break your chains.
I give you liberty. -Enough. Stop it. You're crazy.
crazy...
but not a slave. Crazy, but you're dying for me.
you melt like slime sliding down a wall to touch me.
that's all you want.
I tell you my secrets, you scorn 'em.
I offer myself, and you just want to be fatso's slave.
you're not going to lick me with the same tongue you lick his ass, and the soles of his shoes.
look what I'm going to do with those shoes that you shine so much.
the kiss-ass shoes!
the puppet's, the wretch's shoes!
go on, get them!
crawI for them like a bug, like a worm!
he's got me here and he hasn't even touched me!
not even the hem of my dress, just so you all know!
and I'm dying for a cock!
gardenia WiIson's cock, not some sad waiter's cock!
that's how I am, no matter what you do.
don't say I didn't warn you.
didn't I warn you?
my problem is that I can't lie.
not even a miserable white lie.
pity, it'd all be easier if I could.
I'm coming for you, Gardenia!
I've got business with you!
I'm looking for you, Gardenia!
it's me, Ignacio Jurado!
the Mikado!
a wrestler like you!
without a name or fame but with skill, with strength.
I train daily at home.
Gardenia, this is a matter between you and me, the Mikado!
I knew it.
signed,
she left.
it's my bad Iuck to bring you the bad news, mate.
such is life.
go on pal, go on.
at this stage, that just makes me nostalgic.
Jeepers!
where? -Upstairs.
check them out, boss.
it's obvious they're posh. Leather armchair.
there's been activity in 215 for weeks.
hand it over, son.
they were scattered downstairs.
we sneaked in through the hole. It's been abandoned for ages.
don't tell me they're yours, boss.
they're total beaver shots to get rosie palm pumping.
they say they're mounting a press.
we'll see...
take them up some coffee and a basket of sweet rolls.
except for the chilindrinas...
they're a purely Mexican taste.
and tell them that we deliver.
since when?
since today, airhead, since today.
since I fucking feel like it.
I thought you didn't like your countrymen.
me?
for being reds and republicans.
and how the hell do you know if they're reds or not?
they smell of ships.
only republicans come here now.
why would the franquistas come if they won?
go on, be a smart-ass, you half-breed, you peasant.
people leave their country not just for political reasons.
peasants with hunger clinging to their spine also leave from there.
go on, take them their coffee.
then, like a real man...
you'll explain your treacherous slander to me, and those faggot songs that you sing.
because we don't give deviants work here. That's right.
Kiss-ass...
butt-licker, servile wretch.
I have your mid-morning coffee.
we didn't order any. It's a mistake.
and close the door. We're busy.
don Lazaro sends it on the house.
just don't leave it if you don't want it.
since Splendor closed down, there are rats around here.
they'll get into all our rooms.
we're in 215 here, not in the damn Splendor.
but they're connected.
behind the screen...
there's a hole that the owner made during the strike,
I go down this hole, to get his things out.
the only things you get from here now are rats.
what about the strike?
what about it? It went to hell.
it was like this when I arrived...
and it's going on seven years.
that's what happens with little, shitty, restrained, bratty strikes.
excuse us boss, but we're going to bust your ass.
the place is shut down, and that's that. Fuck it.
so your soIution is a couple of Molotovs and martyrs by the handful?
I'm fed up with martyrs. Fed up with you and your martyrs.
and you...
don't worry about rats.
to avoid hearing Gimeno, even the rats move out.
good afternoon. -Good afternoon.
aIways save them that table.
for the republicans?
Yes, since they think they're such libertarians...
they'll want to use the table as an ashtray.
and only serve cheap brandy.
these refugees get off the boat without a dime.
good afternoon.
what can I get you?
a glass of water.
two.
it's not like that, it's badly focused.
buy a new lens.
it's not like that. -It is. Just like your...
you should've stayed in Madrid.
what the fuck did you do? AIways in the rearguard.
or are we back to the same topic of if Franco this, if Franco that.
untiI when?
untiI they feel like it.
it'll be like Madrid. A long sojourn.
gentlemen...
I've instructed my assistant to keep the place open untiI dawn if need be.
a fellow countryman's hospitality. Anything for our country.
countrymen? You speak like a Mexican.
I was raised here.
so you're a Spanish wetback.
the ideal Spanish wetback. Direct heir to the conqueror.
not us. We just got here, unstained and sinless.
Thanks, and don't listen to Gimeno. He's a joker and a bore.
a joker? He's an anarchist of the worst ilk.
one more joke and they'll throw us out on our ass.
you're in charge.
keep good track of the tab.
I know my countrymen.
and none of your faggy Mikado songs.
give a good impression.
recently defeated,
we cross the ancient sea,
only our memories are left,
our loved ones stayed behind,
left behind, a wounded country,
and we dream of it,
but those dreams will be,
the wings with which we'll return,
Oh, when the tyrant falls,
Oh, when Franco dies.
to my country that they destroyed,
they now ask for asylum,
now it's their turn to be fucked,
and live a loaned life,
all they've left is their desires,
they're screwed.
Damn! It's three in the morning.
what's eating at you?
her?
I'm moping around.
I'm haunted by images.
Nachito, you've always been a dreamer.
Jesus, tell him the truth already.
that she's at the Chinese dens.
stuffed with opium.
she's dead meat. The reaper has sucked her blood.
over there?
there.
give me your foot.
give it, sIut. That's what I pay you for.
it tickles too much.
enough. I'm not playing. You didn't say it was an extra rate.
goddamn it, I only get fucking crazy perverts.
excuse the delay with your photos, let's say it was a proletarian expropriation.
the gloves are a gift for the universal right to bad habits.
the owner's.
what is it?
spanish bean stew.
it tastes of there.
it tastes of there, of home.
one good deed deserves another.
we want to, we need to,
we're going to kill Franco.
for our honor,
for our pain,
we're going to kill,
we're going to kill Franco.
now, explain that bourgeois democracy thing.
it's an anarchist invention...
they stay really late...
don't buy anything, it's not fair.
take note of what proletarian politics is.
you have a date. Go!
we're not going to rob you. We rob your boss...
when you go in the kitchen to jerk off.
this is class war. Understand? Class war.
you're humiliating him. Shit, Madariaga.
if you have a date, go. Ignore his jokes.
not jokes, shock politics.
to wake hate for the boss in the exploited.
keep on picking on him and you'll be toothless.
fuck you and your family.
apologize on your knees...on your mother's and my mother's graves.
see you tomorrow. -Bye.
see you later.
so it's true that you have a free night.
the fight will be over if you're going.
sometimes people lose their wits.
don't listen to him.
don't listen to us. We're just consumed by anger.
it's not easy being the loser.
you want revenge from whoever crosses your path.
and then...
an unthought of generosity appears, unexpectedly.
take Toledano.
he had me...before the firing squad.
I was already worm food.
now you live in his printing press.
you found Splendor there and stole my hideout.
and if we share your hideout?
you have your times and I'll have mine.
your hideout will be my photo studio
I'm an artist of photography.
well, that's what I was untiI the war.
the war came...
and all I got was a bullet hole, although it was a glorious bullet.
stick a finger in.
not that one, your thumb.
feel it.
feel it, damn it! Feel it!
go on, go. You've got your own problems.
and let me make it clear, the war, not age...
turned me into an irreverent old man.
sleep well...
leave, or you'll pay dearly.
I'm looking for Lola.
fair skinned.
all made-up.
Mikado...
meet me at our hideout.
death to the ruling class.
signed, the Mikado.
asshole.
ingrate.
weren't we pals?
take your gags and jokes and go to hell.
the class thing upset you?
the Mikado thing. Some call me that.
how did you know?
because you sing it all the time. Why else?
and because when I was in Russia, in Vladivostok, my comrades in the Red Army called me Mikado.
I'd sing it and sing it, all day long I'd sing it.
it was my battle name. Mikado.
because I like it and I fucking feel like it.
in this life, everything that you fucking feel like doing, is worth it.
go figure.
you really could've been the Mikado.
not me.
if I sing a little bit of it, they lay into me.
that I'm a fag, that I'm queer.
but not anymore.
Enough's enough.
I'll bust anyone's face who lays into me or the Mikado.
that's the way to talk...with bravado.
here's my secret.
I'm not just a common photographer.
I'm a revoIutionary artist.
anarchist, deist, and visionary.
I'm doing "The Autarchist World History" according to Bakunin...
sit.
a gem.
look...
moses and the Hebrews.
moses and the Hebrews,
Spartacus's rebellion, corruption of the papal Curia,
Pope Borgia,
the CiviI War, the freeing of the slaves, the United States.
I'm also preparing the fall of Tenochtitlan.
it's easier here because of the natives.
everything with a libertarian view, of course.
the whores and market porters...come as my models.
the Fall of the Bastille.
since it deals with the masses,
I gave it my libertarian interpretation.
naked prisoners?
economic censorship, the bourgeois weapon.
but we're all equal naked.
I'm behind for lack of time, of money.
damn, how it ruins everything.
sometimes...
I have "cochon" photo sessions.
dirty.
that's why I borrowed your tittie photos.
I took photos of your photos and that's that.
I also shoot wrestlers.
I haven't found a stand-in for that.
I haven't shown anyone.
you're the first.
the others don't understand.
they'd be arguing all day about the flags, the Second International...
meanwhile, I make my evocative montages, and fiIm them with this small camera.
I reset history. "The Autarchist World History."
I'll use Eisenstein's editing technique.
that way, I'll screw both the BoIsheviks, and Indalecio Prieto once and for all.
why are you telling me?
I need someone to sew costumes.
me?
who else?
and it does me good...to talk to someone who doesn't have a cIue about the Fifth Regiment.
I'll do the costumes.
you're sure you want to help me? -Yes.
to shoot wrestlers doing their bit,
I only do it for the money.
human scum disgusts me.
don't say that. My Imelda also goes to matches.
when she goes, she quits whoring.
she likes wrestling.
when blood starts flowing, she says, See? It's not just life that busts our ass.
one can also do it to others.
that's what I like about you, Raquel, your egalitarian spirit.
what about you Nacho? -Gardenia WiIson.
OK, place yourselves...
and smile slyly. You look like angels.
fix his mask. It's crooked. He looks blind.
he's unkempt and he shouldn't be reaping pity.
let me. It's like you understand nothing.
and I mean nothing.
there, that's better.
be still.
smile.
what?
what do you want?
what you looking at?
do I have two heads or are you following me...
cause you fell for the story that I'm a fag?
because I'll show you real fast that it was a publicity stunt.
I come because of Lola.
Jesus, Jesus, free me from the deviI!
it was like getting rid of scabies.
Lola? -She followed me everywhere.
she spied on me. She took it badly.
I've never liked women that beg.
must be that foreign women never had a Mexican mother.
man to man, don't even look for her, because you'll find her.
and if you do, you'll never be rid of her.
OK buddy, leave. It's time to take off my mask.
what?
what?
you want to see my face to see if I'm macho.
I am, and I'm reliable. When I perform, I perform.
look at her.
the days that I serviced her, I serviced her good...
Scram!
gerardo from the cafe.
and fuck Stalin because the son of a bitch had Durruti killed.
you'll see when Franco dies.
go to hell. Communists don't shoot you in the back.
we'll deal with the traitors when Franco dies.
so now, to screw the anarchist comrades, you have to vindicate Franco.
no, it's not that.
the only thing to be done is to go kill Franco.
a long road awaits,
awaits, until Franco's death,
Charles...
...isn't this great?
Yeah.
good afternoon.
Hi.
what wouldn't I do to get my hands on her.
get your hands on who?
the Challenger. $20-million airplane.
What'd you think I was talking about?
come on, Charles. -Charles, you coming?
Mr. Morse, your assistant asked me to give you this.
Charles Morse?
the billionaire? My God, is that who you are?
Yeah.
I've taken the liberty, sir of talking to the pilot of the amphibian.
I've checked the engine log. Plane seems to be in good shape.
I would not advise you to fly under any low ceiling, bird strike, or ice.
what's bird strike? -Flocks of birds. Hit, we're dead.
Yes, especially this time of year.
any questions, I'll fly you in and out myself.
we'll be fine. -I told you you'd have a good time.
when will you require a plane back? -Bob?
they want the film in New York, 36 hours. I'd say 8 tomorrow night.
8.00 tomorrow night.
Yes, sir. -Thank you.
can't handle northern weather?
I'll be all right.
is that a new watch?
Yeah. Dual time zone. T ells the time in two places.
what for?
if I'm in L. A. and want the time in New York, I don't have to add 3.
you built this place by yourself.
Yes, ma'am. Been building it all my life.
okay, right this way, folks.
you don't have to worry about keys, because we got no locks.
IKitchen is always open. You can fix whatever you like.
the bedrooms and outhouses are upstairs.
we want you to relax, kick off your shoes...
...and just get down-home comfortable.
Hey, Stephen.
this is what l' m talking about.
see? That's what I want for tomorrow.
an unsentimental photograph.
t o get a truly unselfconscious photograph...
...you have to go back to the 1 9th century.
how old is that?
took it last fall.
that's Jack Hawk. A friend of mine.
you took the photo?
I took the photo. He took the bear.
I'd be hunting with him now, you weren't here...
...and I had my rifle sighted in.
you interested in books?
Yeah. Why can't you?
what?
why can't you get your rifle sighted in?
I need to rig up a bench rest.
an ironing board makes a good bench rest.
no disrespect...
... I' m surprised you know what a bench rest is.
Charles knows what everything is. Got a question, ask him.
take a mighty accomplished man to claim that.
I don't claim anything.
ask him. See if I'm wrong.
bet you can't stump him.
bet you I can.
I'll tell you what...
... I will give you $5...
...you can tell me what's on the other side of this blade.
it's a rabbit smoking a pipe.
a rabbit smoking a pipe.
why in the world would that be, Charles?
it's a symbol of the Cree lndians. On one side, there's a panther...
...on the other, his prey, the rabbit.
he sits ... unafraid.
he smokes his pipe.
it's a traditional motif.
why is he unafraid?
because he's smarter than the panther.
sir...
...you impress me.
thank you.
amazing accomplishment.
no, it's not an accomplishment.
it's a freak. -ls that so?
Yeah.
I seem to retain all these facts...
... but putting them to any useful purpose is another matter.
Hey, listen up, folks.
we got a problem with bears around here.
now, never leave food uncovered, even in the lodge.
Never!
you see a bear near you...
...stand still.
let him know that you know that he sees you.
then back up...
... real slow.
anybody's in trouble...
...get my attention.
I'll be on it like a duck on a June bug.
now make yourselves comfortable.
on that note, I'm going to bed.
shut up.
Lord, I'm bushed.
new book?
it's about surviving in the wilderness.
you're always reading something.
my secretary gave it to me. Do you know why?
do you know why she gave me the book?
that guy gave me the creeps, with all that ...talk about the bear.
why she gave you the book?
you' re the salt of the earth.
is that so?
you' re a most excellent man.
that's why I married you.
you' re the only woman I've ever wanted.
then see what a lucky guy you are?
Yes, I do.
this is a special day for me. You know that?
I know it is.
I'm really glad you came away with us.
you got to get away more often.
can you go and get me a sandwich?
of course.
did I ever tell you you're an angel?
no.
everything but the wings.
the sandwich.
surprise!
Oh, my God. Charles, are you all right?
Charles, are you all right?
Jesus! I' m sorry!
I' m so sorry.
are you all right?
I' m fine.
are you sure?
happy Birthday. -So you didn't forget.
I could never forget you.
I could never forget.
champagne for Charles.
blow out the candle, Charles.
may I have your attention, please?
can I get serious for a moment? Charles...
...thank you for your...
...Good nature...
...your intelligence...
...your generosity...
forgive us for this charade.
and, in short, happy birthday.
happy birthday. -Thank you.
t o a good companion and a good sport.
and a very brave man.
here.
thank you.
Mickey, that's beautiful!
there's an engraving inside.
what's it say?
it says, "T o my beloved husband...
...on his birthday...
...from the luckiest woman in the world."
this is a superb present. Thanks.
may you wear it in good health.
here you go.
here you go, birthday boy.
thank you.
what is it?
look at that! Nice, I like that. -It's beautiful.
you got to give the donor a coin.
old superstition.
Yes. Thank you. Here.
give him a coin?
if someone gives you a knife you should give him a coin in return...
...or it cuts the friendship.
thank you, Bob.
getting late. Work day tomorrow.
let's pack it in. -Yeah, to bed!
happy birthday.
happy birthday.
Thanks. Thank you.
good night.
happy birthday, Charles. -Sleep well.
happy birthday to you. -Thank you.
nice looking lady.
your wife?
Yes.
why do you ask?
just like to know who everybody is.
hold on, it's flaring.
got it!
and, let's go.
really beautiful. Great!
that's great!
could you lift that up? -My God.
give me the 1 80.
excuse me.
okay, great. One more, let's go.
we'll do one more roll. One more.
officer.
can I sunbathe on this beach nude?
sorry, it's against the rules.
but I have a divine right.
your left ain't bad either.
let's go. Check it, please.
IKodiak bear.
he'll kill you as he'll look at you.
and the ones that killed a man, manhunter for the rest of his life.
nothing he'd rather eat. Got the taste of human flesh.
a man-killing machine.
let's get the boy's shoes polished.
do I need to walk you through this? -It's just the shoes.
scrap the shoes for God's sake.
what is this? Brain surgery? It's a fucking pair of shoes!
let's get James down here. -Robert, he's sick.
he's sick, the shoes look like shit and things I ask...
this is really fucking lame.
the inside of a banana peel will shine shoes.
come with me.
a fount of information. A banana. You should know that!
he's sick, Bob. James is sick.
how sick is he?
he'd have to get better to die.
that guy!
that guy. He's the guy for my photograph.
excuse me, where is this guy?
he's your friend, right? Where is he?
this is the guy we want. Not some fucking model.
where is he?
Jack Hawk? Cabin up north. 80 miles.
does he have a phone?
no phone. No radio. Any case, he'll likely be out hunting
then we'll just go and find him. That's what we'll do.
you can make a compass out of a needle.
God.
that's a new one on me.
do you spend much time in the woods?
no. I' m afraid most of my knowledge is theoretical.
such a... perfect spot.
such a privilege.
it's a shame...
...everyone can't enjoy it.
it is remote and...
true.
you think this spot is so remote that only the few can enjoy it.
but I got a plan.
I got a scheme to develop this lake and I think you could appreciate it.
no need for you to look at these things.
you can envision this better than these folks can draw.
but I want you to look at these things.
now here's the interesting part.
for only 30 or 40 million dollars you can
I beg your pardon?
I thought for a moment you were just being courteous.
what do you mean?
nothing. It's fine.
just leave it to me. -Let's get him. We lose the light
we lose the light at 4. 1 8.
this is the guy we should've shot all along. He has character in his face.
what's the matter?
what?
it's nothing.
he's jaded, that's what it is.
that's it. I'm jaded.
we' re going on an impromptu adventure. You come too.
Charles on an adventure?
that's right. What do you say, Charles? We'll be back in 2 hours.
go. Get some air under your wings.
Yeah. Okay.
behold the mighty hunter. Come on.
Hello!
that's just great.
my model's gone bear hunting.
how butch of him.
Where's he going?
big Bass Lake?
it's about 20 miles northwest!
and we're left here taking a picture of sweet Fanny Anne.
what do you say?
what?
should we chance it? -Be careful.
careful of what?
it's a deadfall.
what's a deadfall?
it's a pit to catch bears. -What' re we being careful of?
it's a pit. They cover it up. Should we press on?
should we be bold? -You really need to find this guy?
I need to get that film. A good plan today is.....better than a perfect plan tomorrow. What do you say?
okay, let's be bold.
there's the spirit that beat the Japanese.
weather coming in from the north. Snow, maybe.
can I tell you something?
if you like.
I admire the way you took that joke.
handled well.
embarrassing. You handled it well.
thank you.
tough row to hoe if you think about it.
what would that be?
all that money.
all the responsibility.
never knowing who your friends are. Never knowing......what people value you for.
it must be tough.
never feel sorry for a man who owns a plane.
what do you value me for, Bob?
I'll tell you what, I like your style...
...and I think your wife's cute too.
Yes.
so...
... how are you planning to kill me?
fuck! Hold on!
what's happening?
goddamn it!
get him up.
get him up. Let's get him up. Come on.
I got him.
Oh, God.
anyone got any matches?
any matches?
help me up.
Oh, my God.
we'll make a fire. Right here.
make a fire.
that's better.
come on.
Oh, God.
come on.
that's it.
Oh, God, no.
damn.
I' m cold.
let's stop fucking about, shall we, and get the guy warm.
Hey, come on. We need those.
we need them.
come, Stephen, be near the fire. Come on, come here.
I'm afraid I let the fire burn out.
we only got a few flares left.
shouldn't we keep them for signaling?
what we need is...
what we want is wood, stacked. For a signal fire.
so when they come they'll see the smoke.
why would they come for us?
they know we went to the cabin.
when they go to the cabin, they'll see the note.
we're in for a bit of a walk.
what does that mean, "We're in for a bit of a walk"?
what the fuck does that mean! What!
I once read an interesting book.
it said that most people lost in the wilds...
...they die of shame.
what?
they die of shame.
what did I do? How did I get into this?
and so they sit there and they......die.
because they didn't do the one thing which would've saved their lives.
and what is that, Charles?
thinking.
look.
Steve, look.
all right, here's the lodge.
here's the hunter's cabin.
this is where we did go, through this pass......the mountains, the river.
they'd be looking for us in the south.
if we can get back south of this pass by tonight...
...we can use the flares.
how do we find it in the woods?
head south.
then we head south. Which way is south?
look.
point the hour hand at the sun...... halfway between the hour hand and 1 2 is south.
this is broken. Give me your watch.
give me your watch.
mine's busted too.
it's lost.
I'll tell you. The birds will be flying south. We'll follow them.
what if we can't see the birds? -I'm sorry I got us into this.
stop that! Stop it!
just stop it!
Where're you going?
going to make a compass.
all right, you take a needle...
... rub it on silk...
... magnetize it...
...and...
... place it on a leaf. Here.
you have a compass.
a needle? Who travels with a needle?
here.
shit!
see, it works.
it works.
that peak is south.
what if it isn't?
it is. It's drawn by the earth's magnetism.
I know how a compass works.
good, then you know...
...that's south.
what do we do when we get to that peak?
we take another sighting.
that doesn't feel south, Charles.
just because you're lost doesn't mean your compass is broken. It's south.
come on.
you know the Vikings would steer their ship with a rope.
how did they do that?
they'd have two set points on the land they'd left behind or sailed from.
and they'd line them up and that would be their bearing.
and then they'd trail this long rope behind their ship......pointing it at those two points there...
might want to conserve your breath. -Say what?
we must get through by nightfall.
come on.
what are the odds that they'll see the flares?
damn fine. Damn fine.
you think so?
I don't know if I think so or not, but I have to say so.
city boy.
is it my diseased imagination or did you say.
how were you planning to kill me?
did you say that?
Yeah.
what did that mean? Why would I want to kill you, Charles?
for my wife.
for Mickey?
Yeah.
that's bizarre. I want to kill you to get next to your wife.
I've seen you with her.
I've seen the way you are.
no offense, but I get my own girl...
...if you noticed, while we've known each other.
you' re a powerful guy. Why would I antagonize you?
why would I want to do that?
t o get the money.
the money.
now it's the broad, now it's the boodle and nothing is safe.
rich man.
all they want is to take something from you. Badly enough to kill you.
you know something, Charles?
the rich are different.
Charles, how far do you think it is?
it can't be more than about 1 0 miles.
shit. -What?
got a stitch in my side.
find a round stone.
find a round stone. Spit under it.
an old lndian remedy?
Yeah, that's right.
you think I'm a fool, don't you?
a fool? No. Old lndian remedy makes sense.

needing people. Isn't it a bitch?
who're we talking about? -Fanny Farmer.
the Mother of Level Measurement.

it's good of you to notice.
IKnows all, tells all. Shall we?

Oh, God!
I lost the flares.
we'll get by without them.
how?
I've got......six matches left.
we'll make a signal fire.
we'll make a signal fire. We'll use a match. The plane will see us.
snap out of it! -It's going to be fine.
it's going to be fine. Which way is it?
it's up there.
come on. -Let's go, Charles.
you okay?
you saved me.
I need you to navigate. -You saved my life.
I couldn't kill you then. I'd have to kill Stephen too.
he knows how I like my coffee.
you saved my life.
buy me something when we get home.
how do you like your coffee?
like I like my women.
bitter and murky.
I lost the bloody flares.
you told me why people die in the woods.
Yeah, they die of shame.
take a lesson from it.
you want to get up. T op of that rise. High as possible.
let the plane see the fire.
why do we think they'll come looking for us?
he's a billionaire. you know what happens when you misplace one.
going to make some story to tell when we get home.
quite a change from, That cab driver was so rude to me!
you see anything?
no.
come on, let's go.
my, God!
shit!
okay, let's see.
maybe it was the buckle that threw it off.
what are we going to do?
it's all right.
we're going to die! -Look here!
we don't know what the hell we're doing here!
what are we gonna do? We' re going to die!
nobody knows where we are! We got nothing to eat!
all right, Steve. Look.
look here.
this is what we're gonna do.
you see this?
going to make a spear, all right?
you want me to make a spear?!
we need you to make one for fishing.
go on, take it.
good. Fine.
you can do that.
they'll never find us.
they will find us. And even if they don't, we'll walk out of here.
you do as I say now, okay?
I'll make a fire.
get on with it!
it's going to be okay.
what is he gonna do, make a spear?
is he going to fish for our dinner?
I wanted to give him something to do.
are they gonna come for us? You are an important guy, right?
right?
Lookit, I'm talking to you!
what would you like to do?
should we lay down and die?
do we lay down and die, Bob?
there's nobody here but us.
have I missed something?
you're right.
you're right, I'm sorry.
shit!
shit!
all right, give me your hands.
God!
t ake your hands away. -What have I done?
what have I done?
Jesus.
it's deep.
I' m not going to lose my leg?
you'll be all right.
press down.
put your hands there.
keep them there.
I'll pull this as tight as you can take it.
bury this.
start building the fire.
you're going to be all right.
ls that all right? Not too tight? -No, it's just great.
good.
it's a clean cut.
I think it bled clean.
if we change the...... bandages regularly...
...it should knit up fine.
guess l' m no lumberjack.
you' re doing fine, Steve.
you'll be fine.
you know something? -What?
you' re all right.
am l?
no, I mean it.
very thoughtful man.
thank you.
and I appreciate it.
it's my pleasure.
so are we gonna get out of here?
Yes, we are.
how are we gonna get out of here?
you see this...
you see that constellation?
Cassiopeia.
the big W?
the right edge of the W points to the North Star.
north Star......is north.
tomorrow we walk......south to the river.
the river will take us home.
it's gonna work better than that compass?
Yeah.
I hope so.
why do people die in the woods?
they die of shame.
it puts things in perspective.
what's that?
out here.
different from the fashion world.
different from snorting coke off the girls' hip bones.
in what way?
you're starting to loosen up.
you think so?
that's my report.
so...
...what?
he's not that badly hurt.
then what are our chances when all is said and done?
we can walk out and probably die, or stay here and he'll certainly die.
I think our chances are good.
seriously.
Yeah! Better than good.
we know that that's north. And that's...
I said we had to bury those.
what difference does it make?
we have to get them down. -Why?
they put the smell of blood in the air, that's why.
I'm not going to climb up a tree in a thunderstorm!
we must get it down!
you climb up the goddamn tree!
give me a hand.
Oh, shit!
Jesus!
Charles, stay back!
stay back!
for God's sakes, Charles!
come on, Charles.
Steve!
Oh, God.
come on!
come on!
so, we navigate by the stars.
we travel by night if there's a moon.
we can't live out the winter up here.
Oh, my God.
we have to fix this.
we will.
I will.
I love you, Christina.
I love you, too, Jesse.
Hey, Sleepy.
rise and shine. It's a beautiful day.
couldn't bring myself to cover it up. Striking, isn't it?
in all these years, whenever there was any trouble, whenever you called
the bad boyfriends, the accidents-- I've always come.
and why is that, Ben?
we grew up together.
we were friends. - No, no.
you got off on playing my white knight.
God, if I hadn't picked someone else in high school...
what? We'd be together now?
you don't get it?
I love Meg. - And I do, too.
she's a sweetheart. A darling, fragile, little dear.
you know, Ben, you really ought to take a look at this little savior complex you got going on.
you're changing colors.
what?
you want to hit me again, huh?
make it two for two.
I... didn't hit you. You fell.
what do you want? What can you possibly gain...
I want you to tell the truth.
I want to hear it.
what we've always known.
just say it and all of this goes away.
go to hell.
so... last night you sort of disappeared on me.
and now you look... not so good.
or is this none of my business?
no, Judy, it is. That's the problem.
it's like my whole messed-up life is now messing up yours.
what have you messed up? - Are you kidding?
your boat burned down last night.
okay, Christina, you looked really hot in that sea aiden outfit, but... not that hot.
you think you're bad luck or something.
or something.
your dad hasn't called back yet, has he?
how is that even possible?
are you sure he's not somewhere where he can't be reached or...?
I just wish I could talk to him.
maybe he could tell me what's wrong with me.
what do you mean what's wrong with you?
not that he would actually say anything if I asked. I mean, my dad and I hardly talk.
never about family stuff.
mom left us." That's all he'll say.
it's okay. It's nothing new.
no, Christina. That sucks.
except for the part where you're here, staying with us.
I hope that doesn't change.
okay, good morning, everyone.
my name is Sarah, and on behalf of the Point Pleasant Historical Society,
I would like to take you on a walk through the fascinating history of our town.
Sarah. - Mr. Boyd.
it's good to see you again.
really good.
I'm working.
I know, I know, but...
that moment we had just now. That-that spark. That's nothing to be ashamed of.
there was no moment. There was no spark.
don't let your husband's issues make you feel bad about a little harmless sexual tension.
that's ridiculous.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have a tour to give.
of course. Just tell the truth, Sarah.
that's what they want. Just tell it.
it will set you free.
come along, everyone.
missed his breakfast, too.
father David hasn't missed a morning meal since the Pope came to Newark.
dear Lord, please deliver Father David back to the fold, safe and...
thought we were praying.
I'm sure Father David is fine.
right. Me, too.
...hardship and adversity defined the lives of the first Puritans who settled here.
though the severe weather claimed the lives of some, the pluck and spirit of the settlers enabled them to get through that first winter.
but it... well...
well, the real danger they faced was the syphilis that was devouring Adlai Coulter's brain.
for weeks he heard voices calling to him from the woods, telling him to butcher his neighbors.
and then one night, he listened.
he took an ax and killed 18 people in their sleep.
which is not normally part of the tour.
I guess I just thought you should know.
well, we shouldn't. - Yeah, we should.
what's syphilis?
it's me.
listen, I know you're busy. Uh, I have to...
where are you?
you're supposed to call, right?
when my ship goes down and I almost die?
daddy, I'm really scared, okay?
I know you can tell me what's happening.
tell me what I am.
I'm all alone with this.
I want...
I just want to...
I want to come home.
mom, will you please tell me how you got that thing? Cut the drama queen crap.
Paula... don't be a bitch.
it's too early.
look, don't worry. The person who did this won't be getting away with it, okay?
I'm going to talk to Sheriff Parker as soon as I get back to the office.
you're calling Jesse's dad?
mom, wait.
if this is another gin-and-tonic accident on the staircase and you tell Logan some story, he's not going to believe you; he'll see right through you.
listen, don't you tell me about Logan Parker, honey. We grew up together, remember?
me, Logan, the Kramers, and about half the damn town
we have history. - Mom, please...
did it ever occur to you that maybe I'm the victim here?
huh? I mean, has that thought ever crossed your mind?
Yeah. It came in a distant second.
Judy, Can I check a message on your machine? I think it might be my dad.
go ahead.
you have one new message. Received Sunday, 8: 15 p. m.
Dr. Kramer, this is Father David.
this is something that can't wait.
Ben, I don't mean to be alarmist, but I think you may be in some danger.
Hey, I was thinking, we should go by the beach and see Jesse.
or... not.
am I being a total bad influence?
Judy, I'm sorry. I can't go.
is it your dad? Did he call?
no, actually it was Father Thomas. He said he found something... about my mom.
that's great. Do you want me to drive?
why are you calling me?
I told you we're done with you. You're not her father anymore.
tell that to Christina.
she won't stop calling. She says she wants to come home.
don't worry, she'll stay.
what makes you so sure?
she's getting attached.
the Kramers. - That's the trick.
make her love and lose, again and again.
eventually the world will feel her pain.
then they'll feel nothing at all.
I swear my mother's living in a soap opera.
want to take a break?
find a nice spot underneath the pier?
Terry will watch over the fort, right, Terry?
wow, Paula, sounds like a plan.
listen, first day crush is on. I'm kind of buried. Sorry.
my mother is going off the deep end, and she's pulling me down with her.
I need my lifeguard. - I really can't right now. Sorry.
but we'll talk later, okay? I've got to gas up the boat.
what's up with him? - I don't know. He's been like that all day.
but listen, Paula...
if you still need a lifeguard... - Just drop it, okay?
Hi, Blanche. Amber Hargrove here.
listen, is Sheriff Parker in?
that's fine. I'll hold. Thanks.
what the hell... - Don't do it.
you make this call, stir up the law, you're going to be mired in the battle of reputations.
and no offense, but you kind of got this glass house thing going on.
what are you talking about, Boyd?
business, mainly.
your business, in this case.
but really I dropped by to discuss the future of our business.
are you spying on me?
not really. No, I've just been looking into you.
which is standard practice when this much capital is involved.
capital?
Amber... I love Point Pleasant. Always have, always will.
so, what, do you want me to help you buy a house?
don't you already own one? - I want you to help me buy the town.
broken?
no. High season gets going, you got four times the traffic, so got to adjust the settings for the increase.
Jesse Parker. Gassing the boat.
gassing up the boat that was three-quarters full already.
hiding from anybody I know?
she knows something's up, brother.
how come I didn't?
I'm a little messed-up about stuff.
Paula and me
I know people say that I don't see what she's like, the games, the diva crap.
I see it.
she was still the best and most exciting thing that ever happened to me in this town.
until Christina.
we have this...
thing.
it's more than just sex. - Just sex?
there was sex, and then more than sex?
no, no, we just kissed, but... - Dude, this is crazy.
I thought I had it all figured out.
stay here, maybe join the force, marry Paula.
but now...
it's like we're made for something.
she's just a girl, man.
don't give her too much power.
Dr. Kramer, this is Father David. I think you may be in some danger.
Judy?! Judy, are you okay? Talk to me.
Judy? Talk to me.
Garrett, scare back this crowd, will ya?
I don't know how much. I don't know.
it's pretty messed up.
Blanche, I want you to send Holden over to pick up Meg and Ben and meet us at the Med Care Clinic. I'm not sure they can take this and drive straight.
Judy, are you okay? Talk to me, please. - What happened...?
God, my head hurts. - I said I'm fine, damn it.
officer, I had the green...
Mr. Hodges, you're going to go back there, you're going to sit down and let the EMTs look you over.
my car is trashed.
she pulled out in front of me.
you better not lie about this!
don't make me say it twice, sir. - Screw you.
and you'd better have insurance. I mean it.
who's that guy? - I am not...
Oh, God. I'm injured. I'm bleeding.
check, please.
point Pleasant's old lighthouse has stood all along as a shining beacon of hope for storm-tossed ships and weary crews.
as it has for all of us...
of course, that is just a load of metaphoric crap.
they don't use lighthouses to navigate anymore. It's all satellites.
as far as the town goes, well, its history seems to be a laundry list of disaster
cruelty, madness, and betrayal...
okay, everybody, please come inside for some sugar cookies and enjoy our gift shop.
God.
veered off the material a little bit there in the end, don't you think?
I don't know what is wrong with me today. I just...
I just spent the entire tour telling all these horrible stories.
I mean, they're all true.
Sarah, I saw you today standing down on Main Street with him.
what, Lucas Boyd again?
he's nobody.
Logan, don't do this. - You think I like this?
I don't know, do you?
what? - You want to talk about this?
let's talk about this, okay.
I had sex with someone, Logan, before you.
I hurt you, and the guilt nearly killed me.
but that was 20 years ago.
I have made my peace with God.
you need to find yours.
or you're going to lose me, and Jesse.
how you doing? - I don't know.
bad.
I said "Ow!
shouldn't somebody give me drugs?
Oh, Judy! - God, here we go.
baby. - Hi. Guys, I'm sorry.
sweetheart, I want you to try to watch my finger with your eyes.
dad, they already did that. They do that here.
Ben, can I borrow you for a second? I just need you to fill out some forms.
excuse me. Sure.
what happened?
well, Judy's stable.
I like her signs, but there is some inflammation around the brain.
hemorrhaging?
maybe. I'd like to keep her here overnight just to watch her.
if the swelling doesn't go down, then we'll have to move her to New Brunswick right away.
you mean cranial surgery?
I don't know how we get through something like that, George.
I mean, Meg's just coming up for air.
how about you? How are you holding up?
I'm okay. It's not me I'm worried about.
I heard Judy Kramer's never going to walk again.
we should sue that bastard.
good luck. I heard his dad owns Rhode Island.
okay, so you've got my attention...
I'm listening to the crickets.
I'll tell ya, somebody's going to have to teach these rich bastards a lesson.
Amen to that.
Amen, indeed.
so... how's your love life?
any prospects on the horizon?
how can you have that face
those... eyes-- and still make me sick to my stomach?
butterflies?
you mentioned a business deal.
right you are.
amber, you and I are going to turn Point Pleasant into a time-share Mecca.
we're going to build something-- something that lasts, that matters, that changes people's lives.
I'm listening.
but first...
I want you to get all your emotional ducks in a row.
now, stop me if I'm wrong, but when Dr. Kramer did this to you, it was an accident, right?
Ben is not your enemy.
is he?
that's right.
he's your goal.
see, this is a targeting problem.
now, your enemy...
is the person that keeps you apart from your goal.
it's nothing personal.
meg's a nice enough person. She just happens to be in the way.
now I think any successful scenario starts with this...
don't you?
wow, a Paula Hargrove visit. I must be dying.
Hey, Jude. Dr. Kramer.
I just drove Jesse here.
he's the one who actually cares about people.
Oh, and I thought my mom's shiner was bad.
Oh, hey, guys.
thank you.
uh, I'm going to... be right back.
so... who wants to look at my X rays?
uh, no reception. I'm gonna step outside and try to call Terry again, okay?
are you hiding from me? - No.
Yes.
it's me. It's my fault.
no. You know what I don't do? This.
I shouldn't have let this happen. - I don't mess around on Paula.
I know. I'm sorry. - But, see, I'm not.
I am when I'm not around you, but then...
I feel like I'm going crazy.
I mean, my God, how can I miss you if I don't even know you?
I miss you, too.
I can't breathe...
I don't know what this is.
Hey, guys. Sorry.
she left, Jess.
I told you, Dad.
some medical tests for the insurance.
some stupid townie, I don't know.
wanna bet she's faking this whole injury thing?
Yeah. I'm that girl's golden ticket out of this craphole town.
so are you sending a...
an innocent will come here to serve the beast.
father Thomas?
I think I know what the mark means.
so do I.
I need help, Father. I need someone to talk to.
I think Father David is dead.
but I didn't kill him. I didn't even know him.
I can feel when I make something happen. I have to want it.
but then there's somebody else in town-- a man-- and...
I've never seen him before, but...
he knows me.
I think he hurt Father David.
I think he wants to hurt all of us.
Christina, I can't help you. Not now.
you told me to talk to God, Father. Help me talk to God.
ask Him what we're supposed to do.
please, Father, just pray with me.
father?
get out!
get out!
daddy?
us, People, In Touch.
this is Judy's kind of waiting room.
Meg, she's going to be okay.
this'll be a story for her to tell at college, that's all.
and as for you...
I just want you back.
I just want us, the way we were before...
Amber? - Hey, guys.
I came straight over when I heard. How's Judy?
what are you doing here? - Well, I...
she's going to be okay.
thanks for these.
I just... we didn't expect... I mean, we just... we wouldn't have thought...
I've been a crappy friend lately, I know.
but it's always something like this that brings a person around.
you can see it, can't you? My black eye.
no use trying to hide it.
look, uh... I had a fight with my garage door.
it was broken, there was a stepladder... long story, really.
I love this on you.
it's so smart.
Thanks.
Ben bought it for me.
takes a brave man to buy clothes for a well-dressed woman.
you got my message?
Yes.
you wanted to talk.
I didn't even know if you were in the country.
my own dad.
don't you think there's something wrong with that?
with us?
it doesn't matter what I think.
it never has.
what's wrong with me?
you know, don't you? - Christina...
you have to help me.
I need you to tell me what I am. I need you to be my father.
I can't.
I can't be that for you.
that's what I came to tell you.
you need to grow up now.
Chris, don't fight it. You'll get hurt.
lots of people will if you try to stop it.
No!
you can't just kick me out of your life!
you'll never want for money. I've taken care of that.
I don't want your money. - It's the only thing I can give you.
daddy, please! - I'm sorry.
she's strong.
you have no idea.
it's not going to be easy; burning the goodness out of her.
who are you rooting for, Kingston?
if I don't win her over, your ass is slung over a pit right next to mine.
honestly?
I don't care anymore.
that's handy.
but you don't matter anymore.
getting cold out here?
no.
so...
I want to help you get through this.
this jealousy thing.
and I had an idea.
what if you and I had a baby?
yours and mine.
you know, our own.
I never really wanted kids in the first place.
I never really wanted anything...
but you.
till you came back from the city that summer, and suddenly you were a package deal.
you accepted me, anyway.
you gave me a life I love.
you gave Jesse a father.
we lied to him. - No, we didn't. We told him we are a family, and we are.
I still see you looking at him like he's taking something away from you.
like you're jealous of him.
well, it's hard not to be.
you act like you think the kid is touched by God or something.
I don't think-- I know.
it's not just me. Everyone's felt it.
since he was born.
I'm not done.
well, I am.
how can I give you my kid, when you already have a saint?
I just need one word before I go.
what are you doing here? Really.
I'm trying to apologize, I guess.
my behavior has been appalling. I know that.
just walk a mile in these heels, you'd be crazy, too.
Ben, I... I don't want to hurt you. Honestly.
you've been good to me.
and I thought you should know. I mean, it's... all over town.
what?
the guy that hit Judy, Preston Hodges... - Yeah?
his family is very well-connected at the state house.
he's coming after you with a civil suit.
you better get your lawyer on the phone.
Ben, please.
I've seen brats like this destroy people.
how could he do this?
I need some air.
what's wrong, Christina?
what kind of a man does that?
I don't know.
if you're a father, you're supposed to protect your kid, no matter what, right?
I'm trying. I am.
do it, Daddy.
protect us.
do it, Daddy.
stay away from my girls!
somebody call the police!
stop it! Ben, you didn't want this.
I did, and I put it all in you.
please, stop!
I have money. I'll give you whatever.
Ben! No!
please. Don't let this happen.
no.
Ben, it's Christina.
I know how free you are right now.
no fear...
no love...
nothing.
it's called evil.
and you have to give it back to me.
where are we?
come on.
I know the way back.
stay away from them.
Hey. Wow. Dad, that was a long walk.
Yeah, I know.
you're dressed.
Ben. There you are.
I talked to George, and he said the swelling went down, so we can take her home.
I know. Great. Much with the drama. What a night, huh?
well, thank you, Ben.
I think it is my color.
father Thomas.
listen, I didn't mean to scare you back at the church.
I think it was more the other way around.
you don't need to worry.
I don't want to cause any trouble here.
I'm leaving in the morning. - I wish you wouldn't.
I thought I understood what you are. The symbol, your power.
what is it?
what am I?
I think you know.
the symbol means one thing.
you're his child.
and there are things that I'm supposed to put in place.
a protocol... to destroy you.
but when you took my hands and we prayed at the church...
what? - I felt...
love.
I felt closer to God than I ever thought was possible.
you were in pain, Father. Your eyes were gone.
I can't explain it.
it was so big.
it scared me, and so much of it was coming from you.
so much of what? - Goodness, Christina.
God's love.
I get why you want to get out of here, but what I know about your fate, the fate of this town, is that the final fight is here.
the darkness may be present...
but so is God.
I...
I felt something like that...
earlier this evening at the lighthouse.
grace can win.
it can win in Point Pleasant and it can win in you. I believe it.
I'm afraid I'll hurt someone if I stay.
or...
you'll save them.
Christina... - I won't let you destroy these people.
not much for small talk, are you? - I'm serious.
I know, and I think it's cute.
cute?
Donald?
Catherine...
...this just isn't working out, right?
...Sculpture or computer generated graphics.
it doesn't matter what style you chose to work in.
whether it's primitivism, ...romantic realism, postmodern deconstructivism.
the same rules apply.
everything is governed by the laws of nature.
nowhere is this principle more perfectly manifested than in the human form.
excuse me.
ehm, is this the, eh...
light study?
wait a minute, don't tell me, let me guess.
Lily Leonetti.
two weeks and 30 minutes late.
sorry. Family emergency.
it's alright, come on in.
let's get you setup over here.
I don't think Catherine's coming back.
alright, let's stay focused, folks.
we were talking about learning the rules before you break them.
specifically, perspective and proportion as it relates to the human body.
which brings us back to Isabel.
so, see if you can discover the hidden truths of shadows and the light.
translate what you see through your arms and finger tips on to the page.
is this 508 Alta?
I'm Gredin.
Lily.
I know.
thank you.
follow me.
the entrance is in the back.
I'm Lily, the new room mate.
Oh, you're here.
I'm Tanya, by the way.
anything in this cupboard is mine.
and the living room is off limits
and the living room is off limits because that's where I practice.
Bridgette, Lily.
english major, right?
no, art.
painting.
that's funny, I would never have guessed.
well, I can see we're off to a good start.
Hi.
is she always like that?
unfortunately yes.
what about that guy, Gredin?
Gredin is really cool and an amazing sculptor.
and that's Robert.
a major talent.
well, here we are.
it's not exactly the Beal Air.
in fact it's not even The Ramada.
it's nice.
where did you say you were from again?
Michigan.
first time to L. A?
first time anywhere, really!
well, the world of bytes is calling.
I gotta run.
how's L. A. kiddo?
hi dad, it's good.
it's nice.
well, this place feels pretty empty without you.
hold on, your mum wants to talk to you.
OK.
hi mum.
did you like your surprise?
hold on a sec.
what is it?
it's just a little something to remind you of us.
you know, I don't know why you had to go all the way to L. A.
to be an artist.
we could have bought you a car if you wanted to stay.
Mary Jane you know, Catherine's daughter she went to state and she's very happy making all sorts of arts and crafts.
mum, do we have to have this conversation again?
Where's daddy?
Bob!
Oh, he's gone off somewhere.
I gotta go.
go? We just got on?
mum, I'm gonna be late for class?
OK, will we see you at Thanksgiving?
I don't know yet, mum. I haven't looked up my schedule.
I try, OK?
fine, don't forget to call me!
that's Peter, performance artist.
or as he likes to refer to it:
self as show.
some day with any luck somebody will put him out of his misery.
look at her, Lily.
what do you see?
I see...... a face.
and a body.
and what else?
I see a naked woman.
right.
the whole naked woman, not just parts.
not just the head.
soft skin.
cloaked breast.
and a waist.
legs, the whole thing.
get it all on the page.
keep going over again and again and eventually
technic will give way for expression.
thank you.
or expression will give way to expression.
you have some thoughts you'd like to share with us?
me?
thought? Share?
no, I couldn't possibly.
I'm here to listen and learn.
copy and conform.
from the masterpiece you just created,
it's obvious you have transcended all need for traditional form.
this, my fellow students was created
out of no other tradition
without form.
this this is an A plus.
this is a perfect example of a 100 percent surrender to the process of tradition.
it is so lifelike you can almost fuck it.
you through?
will you get back to work?
Jack ass.
you OK?
can I come in?
no, I'm not dressed.
I'm sorry about earlier.
it had nothing to do with you.
january 28th.
it's late and I'm wide awake.
burning up, bored.
feel like dancing.
having some fun.
like turning someone over.
tease, taunt...
... twist him around my little finger.
taking him to places he never knew he wanted to go.
bad places.
dark places.
great places.
february 1st. Selfportraits.
to expose it all.
to see myself the way a lover would.
no shame, no fear.
not a fear in the world.
nothing hidden, no secrets.
nothing hidden...
... no secrets.
with you I'm so foolish it hurts.
the mouth wants to speak but only knows the wrong thing to say.
without you there is no flower and nothing good grows in the garden of my heart
I understand you are looking for a babysitting job?
Bridgette! Shut that shit off!
I'm gonna kill her.
you wanna help? Good!
I was thinking fat pills.
she's always saying if she gains one more pound she's gonna kill herself.
suicide? Very good.
thank you.
I got a job!
doing what?
babysitting.
how totally sweet!
she hates me.
I'm a little sensitive now.
you two know each other?
we do but she might not wanna know me now.
tell her I'm not half bad, Tanya.
I wish I was half as good as you, Gredin.
come on, I'll make it up to you.
nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?
I got carried away with Donald
I shouldn't have put you in the middle of it.
no, I probably overreacted.
I can sometimes be hypersensitive.
you shouldn't be, you got it.
the only person in class
whose hand the teacher has to hold.
well, Falk has a thing for his female undergraduates.
especially when they look like you.
what is this?
this is my magical craft.
I'm sort of hoping it will win me at Guggenheim.
you'll get it.
you psychic?
no. You deserve it.
so where were you the first two weeks?
well...
... When I applied
I never thought I'd get accepted.
and I was... I just freaked.
no big family emergency.
just my little private one.
that's all.
that's enough.
you see that hill over there?
that's Beverly Hills. That's my home.
might as well be Timbuktu.
my father and I we don't talk any more.
what are you thinking?
making a wish.
what do you wish?
that I could just...... open my eyes and be different.
silly of me.
Hey, listen.
you're beautiful.
no, I'm not.
Yes, you are.
you're sweet.
you're beautiful.
and different.
march 1st.
how do you know what you can do until you do it?
how do you know who you can have until you've had them?
I didn't know him from Adam.
but I knew exactly what he needed.
what he needed was me.
a dark club.
loud music.
a corner to ourselves.
anonymous. Shameless.
no past. No future.
valeria Andrews: What's Come Over Me
tease.
taunt.
twist him around my little finger.
no shame. No fear.
without a fear in the world.
looking good.
that guy's a loser.
besides, I have a lot more to offer than just a fine young body.
I have it up here.
that's too bad.
all I'm really interested in is your body.
same time, same place?
maybe.
hey there.
well, what do you think?
it's...... intense.
there's something very tragic and terribly exciting that has happened in your life.
see, women only change their hair if it's one of the two.
I don't know.
I think I was just bored.
Oh, come on, I bet it was something exciting.
like what?
I confess, I'm not really a fortune teller.
you've such a pretty face, you shouldn't hide it behind that new hairstyle.
Donald?
thought I'd find you here.
Lily, meet Angela, my wife.
Angela, this is Lily, our new babysitter.
nice to meet you, Lily.
12 Mississippi.
13 Mississippi.
14 Mississippi.
15 Mississippi.
I'm ready!
16 Mississippi.
Lily, hurry up!
Daphna?
got you!
I must say, Daphna you are a great hider.
thank you!
you're welcome.
those are pictures of daddy's paintings.
he doesn't like to paint anymore.
Why?
mama says it's because painting makes him crazy.
Daphna, where are you?
I'm gonna hide again.
hi baby!
what you've been up to?
I did the portrait.
great!
Angela's getting back to her photography.
she always said she'd give Daphna four years but lucky Daphna got a full seven!
right.
why don't you take Lily home?
Hello, I'm hiding but no one's coming to find me!
so...
so, why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself, Lily?
where was it you were from?
you'll laugh.
Kalamazoo, Michigan.
born and bred.
well, that's a big move, huh?
all the way out to California by yourself?
I was really scared at first.
I think I made the right decision.
definitely.
can't afford to be afraid at your stage of the game.
right up here?
Yeah, that's it.
I guess I better let you off.
thanks a lot.
your bag!
Thanks.
listen, if you wanna show me some of your other works sometime
I'd love to see it.
like when, right after class?
Yeah, I'm in the studio every afternoon.
back of the faculty building.
Yeah, maybe I'll do that.
june 1st.
Ivy's philosophy, number 21.
never fall in love.
for as long as I can break somebody's heart that's love enough for me.
how do you know what you can do until you do it?
how are you?
good, and you?
I'm good.
thirsty?
sure.
you don't like it?
I think you look incredibly sexy!
I'm glad you like it.
did Donald like it?
I saw him dropping you off.
seems like you're becoming a regular teacher's pet.
no, just his babysitter.
do you still think that I'm different?
beautiful?
may I?
may I?
valeria Andrews: Aching for You
there I was again.
going out into the unknown, just because.
do you remember me?
take me with you!
I can't.
you didn't think I'd come, did you?
I wasn't sure.
bring it here.
great Midwest.
looks nice.
Thanks.
good student.
student?
well... Still very cautious.
careful.
you know, it's ...
... it's sort of funny to me the way you can teach and judge
and yet you yourself no longer paint.
you think that's funny?
no, actually I think it's bullshit.
what do you propose to do about it?
I don't know.
see...
... being an artist ...
... in order to be a serious artist you have to be willing to sacrifice everything.
you have to confront your demons.
go into battle with them.
that's what I want.
I'm ready for that.
Really?
I lost a few battles along the way myself.
that's why I stopped painting.
well then, maybe
I can help you face your fears?
and you can help me face mine?
you sure?
sit down.
do it.
take off your clothes.
does that prospect frighten you?
Yeah, a little.
then all the more reason to do it, right?
Simone Shook: Deeper
see ya.
tomorrow?
I'm really late for work.
you know, you make me feel like one of those seduced and abandonded cases.
this isn't a boy-girl thing, Gredin.
this is a work thing
are you sure?
don't be so insecure.
Hi, this is Lily. I can't get to the phone so leave your message after the beep. Thanks.
got you!
we're having a party tonight.
it's gonna be pretty loud so
I just thought I'd let you know.
fuck her.
yo, over here!
Hey, you beautiful man!
stop pushing to me!
my god, it's so high.
why put a sculpture all the way up here?
here's beer.
you better not dance with anybody but me tonight.
you're so sexy!
fuck him.
Oh, there's gonna be so much fun.
Fuck'em all.
are you out of your mind?
why would you wanna do something like that?
self expression?
wait a minute, first you cut off all your hair
then you pierce your belly button
and now you're smoking?
what the hell's going on with you?
Tanya, don't you have a super highway you need to get on?
why don't you go out and have some fun?
I was just leaving.
guess I won't introduce you to Roxanne.
what should I have?
how about an Ice breaker?
and what exactly is an Ice breaker?
turn around and I'll show you.
don't move.
ice breaker it is.
Thanks.
dance with me.
Oh， my god.
no one's safe with you around!
Yeah, you've got a problem with that?
Hi, this is Lily, I can't get to the phone so leave me a message after the beep.
Thanks.
Lily, it's your mum.
Lily, we're worried about you.
your dad want's to talk to you.
hey kiddo, how you doing?
please call home, darling your mother's driving me crazy.
Hey, we'll see you at Thanksgiving, right?
God.
is that the time?
I'm late for Donald's class.
so we're late for professor Falks class?
what's the big deal?
I wanna go. That's what the big deal is.
so go.
what do you think I'm trying to do?
what are you doing for Thanksgiving?
I don't know yet.
Bridgette, Tanya and Robert are gonna go home.
it's gonna get rather lonely around here.
what about you? What are you gonna do?
who was that on the phone?
I don't know.
somebody who obviously didn't want to talk to me.
you know, there seem to be a whole lot of "I don't know."
don't.
what's the matter?
what did I do?
you tell me.
what are you doing?
I wanna know, Lily.
I really can't have this conversation right now because I'm late for class.
I don't know who you are anymore.
I don't know who I'm making love to anymore.
if this is some kind of contest, Lily...
... I don't wanna compete.
I thought you wrote these.
what a nice surprise!
thought you might be hungry.
as a matter of fact I am, thanks.
since when do you lock the door?
since last ...
you're painting again?
delicious honey, thanks!
can I have a look?
no, you don't have to ask.
when I have something to show you, I'll show you.
you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Why?
so you're painting?
no one in particular.
OK, fine.
what do you want me to do, stand in front of my class for the rest of my life
and nag about stuff I don't have the guts to do anymore, like a hipocrite?
that's not what we're talking about.
I don't want to lose you again.
and especially not to some 21 year old undergraduate who looks up to you as a god as poses between fucks.
you and Daphna are my life.
and I love you very much.
the last time nearly killed us, Donald.
right.
well, where were you today?
what do you mean?
you weren't in class, neither was Gredin.
any connection between the two?
you know, I'm gonna go...
wait, wait, just tell me.
were you with him?
wait.
don't go.
I don't want you to go.
can't let you go.
can't stop thinking about you.
that painting is the first one I've made in years and it's because of you.
I've never felt this way before in my life.
help me overcome my fear.
big scary cat.
love you for it.
Donald, what are you doing?
kissing you.
falling in love with you.
don't.
Why?
just don't.
come here.
what?
beauty scares me.
terrifies me.
wait, wait.
who is it?
it's Diana.
not right now, OK?
alright, I come back.
it's alright.
stay.
I'm really sorry about the way I've been acting lately.
this is just a really hard transition for me and I...
I've been confused.
but I'm not confused anymore.
please don't give up on me.
don't just stand there, Donald. Invite them in.
this is Gredin, he was kinda homeless so I invited him.
I hope you don't mind.
no, not at all. Hi Gredin.
you two know each other?
Yeah, he's in my class.
Oh.
wow, it feels great in here. Can I do anything?
you can set a plate for Gredin.
Hi, Lily!
can I ask you something?
is Gredin your boyfriend?
is that you?
Yeah. Yes, it is.
Donald painted that a long time ago.
that's me.
come in.
I'll show you around.
very good.
very nice.
why didn't you tell me you were inviting Lily?
thought I did.
you didn't.
all set.
good idea.
Thanks.
will be good with this one, Lily.
please.
will you bring the cranberries for me?
Lily, grab the mineral water, would you?
it's in the fridge.
I'm glad you're here.
what's up, where are you going?
into the other room.
where do you think I'm going?
wait just a second.
don't.
let me just look at you.
why did you bring him?
because he's my boyfriend.
so, Gredin, why don't you sit over here?
Lily, next to Gredin.
Daphna, you're here beside Lily.
Donald, you're over here next to me.
do you have a cake for Johnny?
of course.
I'm finished mum. I'm gonna hide.
fine honey, you go ahead.
so, Lily tells me you're a photographer.
I used to be. Making a comeback.
and you're a painter?
I'm a sculptor mostly.
an amazing sculptor.
a diversion of life study.
that's not entirely true.
really, used to be.
me and Donald agree on a couple of things.
like your beauty, for example.
I've never seen your work before.
it's good.
it's amazing what you can do with the right subject.
Donald's painting again.
first time in a long while.
I'll get some more wine.
he's really serious about it.
it's a secret.
so, ehm ...
... how did you and Donald meet?
I wanted to do a life study class.
I heard about this single, brilliant, good looking professor and weazled my way into his class.
and the rest is history.
bit of a cliche, I know.
some more?
Thanks.
angela was just telling us how the two of you met.
for God's sake, let's not bore them with out trivia.
I never actually thought of it as trivia, Donald.
Where's Daphna?
sound asleep.
she should be in bed, shouldn't she?
come on sweety, let's go.
I'll take her.
no, I want daddy and Lily to take me.
well...
good night.
let me give you a hand.
Yeah, thank you.
there you go.
sleep tight, beautiful.
good night, little girl.
good night, big girl.
what are you doing?
what does it feel like I'm doing?
are you fucking crazy?
I'm fucking crazy about you.
what was that?
I cut myself.
here.
right here?
will you fuck me right here?
you don't love me.
let go of me.
love me.
Lily, love me.
get off me.
don't you dare touch her!
shit.
don't you dare touch her!
calm down.
911, state your emergency.
mama?
fuck you, Ivy.
shit.
Daphna's gonna be fine.
I don't know if you care.
and you?
am I fine or do I care?
I can't let you go, Lily!
not after everything we've been through.
it's over, Donald.
don't fight me, Lily.
don't shut me out.
I can't let you go, Lily.
I love you too much, I ...
get off!
I'm not gonna hurt you Lily, just let me in.
the police are on their way.
I never meant to hurt you.
you'll have to believe me.
what are you doing?
go, baby.
go, go.
I know it's pointless to ask you to forgive me.
OK, well. I just gotta talk.
then you won't have to deal with me anymore.
my whole life
I've felt like a freak.
you know, back home in Michigan
I wasn't accepted because I was different and then I come here
I'm not different enough.
so
I decided to become someone else.
someone tough and infallible.
beautiful and sexy.
fearless.
and it worked.
for the first time in my life I was accepted.
and I became intoxicated by the freedom of it all.
until it was too late.
it's too late, isn't it?
well ...
for what it's worth...
I love you.
I love you.
you gave T. J. money for that nightclub, didn't you?
I thought that if he had something that he was proud of that...
he could stay clean this time.
we had a deal. We had a deal, and you can't even go... - Stop.
...one day without getting high.
I am considering running for president again.
it's crucial nothing leaks out before we're ready.
nobody takes me seriously.
you want to be taken seriously? Take yourself seriously.
this is how it works, Douglas.
you help me by giving me everything I need to know about your mother's plan.
I owe you now.
those of us in the Republican Caucus are united, and we'll camp out in the House Chambers over Christmas if we have to, but we're not gonna make the American people pay for a huge new entitlement they don't want.
what a putz.
I think he's very attractive.
Yeah, he is.
and he's smart, too. Graduated summa cum laude from Stanford.
how do you know that?
he had that spread in Vanity Fair.
"best abs on the Hill," or something like that.
if only his political opinions were as toned as his six pack.
eight pack.
is that even possible?
Yep. Oh, yeah, sweetheart.
you know, it doesn't take a summa from Stanford to see that child poverty in this country is a tragedy.
that douche bag Reeves is the worst.
I'm not Garcetti's biggest fan, but it shows how truly screwed up this country is when a first-termer like Sean Reeves can just stick his finger in the eye of the President.
as far as I'm concerned, he can put it wherever he wants.
T. J.look at this. Do you remember?
you made this in, uh, Ms. Bea's third grade art class.
I've got to get going.
but we just got started.
I have the N. A. meeting.
okay.
I am so proud of what you're doing.
I love you, Mama.
I love you, too.
I love it when you play.
God, I can't stay.
we reconvene in an hour. Still deliberating?
what are you holding on for?
the bill goes way too far.
it gives municipalities carte blanche to take kids away from their parents without enough judicial review
that's child endangerment, not child protection.
either you just made me want to switch parties, or have sex again.
well, there'll be plenty of time for that.
we could be here through Christmas...
my wife
she's pretty.
bet you and her were king and queen of the prom.
Oh, God, no.
we were nerds.
couple of corn-fed, football loving Methodists.
was it love at first sight?
I didn't know what love at first sight was... till you.
flirting with me at a grocery store.
you were shameless... I had a wedding ring on.
extra point.
besides... I knew you were checking me out.
don't you have to leave?
they can start without me.
last December... that's the last time I was really happy.
six months clean.
today
longest period of time I'd gone without using since I was a kid in the White House.
the fishbowl, you know?
as they call it... The bubble around the President's family.
all the eyes, the judgments, the expectations... made me feel very alone.
my twin brother could handle it, but me, not so much.
so... booze, weed, pills... made me feel a lot better.
and then I found coke.
and then everything fell by the wayside.
so my life's... been pretty much a blur.
highs... and lows.
mostly lows.
I know there's no cure for this thing, but there's recovery.
good share, man.
I didn't know you had kids.
it's my sister's place.
I just locked her in her bedroom.
figuratively.
she's infatuated with you.
remember when you were on the cover of People?
she had that taped to her mirror for way too long.
you live with your sister?
it's temporary.
don't ask, okay?
so... the run for the White House.
right.
you do all the asking.
catch me up on the campaign.
fundraising, your father's potential involvement... - What campaign?
in the last three weeks we've flown over 25, 000 miles, crossed every time zone.
my mother's schedule has included almost everything except campaigning for the Presidency.
well, that was exciting.
can we go home now?
is Garcetti finished keeping me on ice?
our primary strategy... three days after we touch down, we will be up and running.
I'll start rounding up high-level donors, give us the leverage to jump into the primaries on our own schedule.
let's go home.
I'll need that list of donors.
and about your father, was it your decision to hire him a publicist?
word is she was brought in to help rehabilitate his image as a reckless womanizer.
let's be honest, there's only one... Elaine Barrish.
and she was...
...and she still is the love of my life.
next question.
if half my clients stuck to the script like that, I would be one happy publicist.
you got so choked up, misty-eyed.
who knew you had it in you?
mark my words, Mr. President, there will be a tear bump.
a "tear bump?" Christ sakes.
I'm the man who looked the Russians in the eye, and convinced them to get rid of 5, 000 nuclear warheads.
about your son's club opening this weekend...you're not going.
I have to be there for him.
and one picture of some drunk coed with her arm draped around you, and everything we've worked for goes to shit.
now it is your job to be a good, little boy, Mr. President.
and it's my job to show the world what a good boy you can be.
so is your father going?
to your brother's club opening?
of course. Whole family's going.
you don't think that's bad press waiting to happen?
T. J.'s under supervision.
I got him a 24-hour chaperone to keep him on the level.
who's keeping you on the level through all this?
she's, uh, a real trooper.
she must be.
she agreed to sit down with Georgia Gibbons to do a puff piece on her company.
georgia is the journalist... - I know who she is.
listen, I will hold my nose, and slip you a few political details, but stop prying into my family life.
that wasn't part of our deal.
"Yeah... "Somebody has to put our family first, we can't take another run.
full access means full access.
unless you want me to tell your mother how you betrayed her by coming to me in the first place.
you need the full story or else you already would have run the scoop.
why you want it so badly, Ms. Berg, I don't know, and I don't care.
now what I do know is whatever deal we have, whatever this is... you need me as much as I need you.
morning, Zulu time, Naval Station Coronado intercepted an emergency distress call from the Chinese nuclear submarine Gui-Lin.
the signal faded quickly, and 38 seconds later, the station's hydrophones heard this...
she bottomed out hard.
13 nautical miles off San Diego.
not surprising really.
the Chinese are spying on us every way they can.
how many men aboard?
about 100, sir.
so 100 men are trapped in a sub at the bottom of the ocean, getting slowly cooked by nuclear radiation?
so good to have you back, Elaine.
the whole country just about fell apart while you were overseas.
forget the crew.
it's San Diego we should be worried about.
how fast can the Chinese dispatch a rescue?
in all likelihood, they won't.
the distress call was sent from depth.
it makes the signal weak.
such that we can hear it 13 miles away, but the Chinese can't.
and even if they did...
chinese can't send surface ships that close to our shores without giving themselves away.
we have to tell them. - Tell them? In hell. We wait.
getting our hands on that sub will be a major victory for counter-espionage.
we are talking about 100 of their men dying slowly from radiation poisoning, and you think letting that happen is the proper course of action here?
Elaine... - Ethics aside, the Chinese are the world's second superpower.
our relationship with them is the key global partnership of this century.
now their boys are in trouble and we know about it.
I'm sure they'd appreciate a heads up. - Thank you, sir.
Elaine, you run back channel on this, but be cautious.
you'll be telling them we know they were spying.
who are you?
I'm, uh, Gunner Cox. T. J.'s sober partner.
keeping him on the straight and narrow.
in my day we'd call you a party pooper.
this place is amazing.
it's like it's right out of a magazine or something.
that's because it's right out of a magazine.
Oh, this is... Gunner.
please to meet you.
it's very reassuring to us that you're here.
I'm all right. Sorry, my phone's been on fire with the opening night.
okay, so here's the plan.
we're all gonna convene here and shuttle over to the club together.
we'll do the whole red carpet thing, and then we'll have dinner around 10: 00.
first of all, Mother and I don't eat at 10: 00.
there's not enough Maalox in the whole world.
which is why I spoke to Martin. So he's gonna set up a buffet here for everybody.
Oh, Jesus.
sorry, I got to get this.
things fall apart when I'm not there!
hello.
that is a whole lot of pep.
what's going on? Fred said he needed me.
we might have had a breakthrough on the House vote.
the Child Protection Bill. I thought that was dead.
uh, could you folks, uh, give me and the secretary a moment?
Yes, Mr. Vice President.
Elaine, have a seat, please.
uh, look, uh, we're gonna get the votes, uh, just not the way we wanted.
we're gonna turn Sean Reeves, who turns a dozen other Republicans our way.
how?
well, uh, it would seem that the congressman from Ohio is a...
homosexual, and neither his constituents nor his wife would react very well to that news.
Fred, your tactics disgust me.
when the president hears about this... - Please. You think he doesn't know?
look, it just dropped in our lap, and you know they'd do the same to us if they had us by the short hairs.
we're supposed to be better than they are.
our party has been trying to pass a bill like this for two decades!
you have a lot of your own blood, sweat and tears in it.
and I'm keeping my distance now.
you're already involved.
congressman Reeves is having an affair with your son, Thomas.
I know your son has had some problems in the past.
hate for him to get caught in some kind of scandal, not that it has to come to that.
I just, uh... Thought you should know.
li Bao. - Madam Secretary.
so good to see you.
forgive me for putting you out of a job for just a few minutes, but my old friend and I speak several languages, and it's fun to practice them.
Yes, it is.
and then you say, uh,"It sounds better in English.
you must let sleeping dogs lie.
always so good to see you, Madam Secretary.
your trip was very much appreciated.
this is the first time I've seen you nervous.
who are you trying to impress?
you, Gunner.
I've been hot and bothered all day thinking about your balls tickling my thigh.
so, listen, can you just park it out in the car for a few? Calm down.
it's not... I'm gonna do blow in the lobby of the Wrigley.
how long has it been going on?
six months.
he's married, T.J. - I know that, Mom.
so, what were you thinking?
I wasn't thinking anything.
it just kind of happened.
you're gonna let them do this?
come after us like some kind of witch hunt?
I think what they're doing is the lowest form of politics, but the congressman created this situation for himself.
it's-it's not a situation.
whatever it is, you have to stop it.
no.
Yes. Because if you think coming out in the White House was tough...
Oh, don't.
...wait till the press gets a hold of this.
they will string you up for every right-wing weirdo in the country.
right. - That's the last thing you need right now.
this is cause Sean's a Republican. How about that? - Oh, come on!
if he was a hot young Democrat congressman they were after...
that's ridiculous. - ...you would have destroyed them.
you are having an affair with a closeted married man.
that is what concerns me.
you don't know him.
he's trapped in his marriage, in his life.
he's gonna leave her.
he's a politician.
if he was going to leave her, he would have done it.
this is my territory.
I was married to your father, remember?
I'm in love with him, Mom.
I never thought this was gonna happen to me.
I feel like a different person when we're together.
and I haven't been high in six months. Not even an aspirin.
you are tying your sobriety to this asshole.
you are in so much trouble.
then help us.
you can't let them threaten him like this.
you got to stop them. - Oh, come on.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I can't, and I won't.
you're the most important woman in the world, and you can't help me?!
I'm trying to help you.
that is what I'm doing.
you just can't see it!
uh, you...
you look... great.
thank you. Yeah.
Hey, I,um... I heard some things.
I was a little concerned.
total rumors.
well, mostly.
Yeah, well, I-I wish we could talk more, but... No.
I'm slammed, too.
I'm opening a nightclub.
Oh, you know, I,um... I read about that.
you should come.
Yeah, I'd-I'd like that.
I'll... I'll have my secretary call for details.
I always knew you'd be running this town one of these days.
listen, thanks for trying, Elaine.
we've done everything we can.
we can rescue them ourselves... - The president's decided to respect the wishes...
we can't just give up on a hundred lives.
a what?
come on.
you're planning to unseat us.
it's been obvious since you forced the president's hand on Iran just to rehabilitate your philandering husband.
my ex-husband, Fred, and I don't have to stand here and listen to this crap.
you think we don't know about his little trip to Jubal Jacobs?
now he's on TV blubbering like a baby?
come on, Elaine.
we're not idiots.
well... I thought you might have the decency to resign first, but no.
you want to attack us from inside the gates.
it's sedition.
what Fred is responding to is the idle chatter around town, so I'll chalk up his accusation to loyalty to you.
it's out of the same loyalty that I am here reminding you of how strongly you feel about saving these men.
well, I'm glad that's settled Your loyalty.
listen, Elaine, it's done.
those boys are now a Chinese problem.
and if they're dropping it, I think we should, too.
all my experience was in Southern California...
...so it... it took me a while to adjust to Washington's more traditional aesthetic.
right. Well, D.C. is certainly discovering you.
you were just hired by RG3, the Redskins' rookie quarterback.
8, 600 square feet to be completed by the fall and the start of the NFL season.
how would that conflict with your fianc? schedule?
Oh, he already works all the time.
Yeah.
his hours as his mother's chief of staff must be pretty grim, huh?
Yeah.
the campaign's only gonna make it worse, right?
times ten.
so, will your wedding take place before or after the formal announcement?
what announcement?
Elaine's campaign for president?
which you just said will make Douglas even busier.
would you like to see my designs for Robert's home theater?
no, I want to talk about how your future mother-in-law plans to run for president in the Democratic primary.
I shouldn't have said...
whatever I said.
uh, I would like to make that off the record.
that's not how it works.
you have to call "off-the-record" before you say something.
but don't worry. No one will find out. I won't use your name...
if you just nod "yes" or "no" when I ask a simple question.
okay. Has Elaine Barrish discussed with her family her intentions to run for president in the upcoming primary?
she got it on record?
look, she tricked me, Douglas.
I didn't even know what I was saying until I'd already said it.
but it's on record?
look, I... I tried to take it back, okay?
I should have never talked to her.
your mom's gonna hate me even more than she already does.
my mother does not hate, you, okay, and this is not your fault, Annie.
it's that bottom feeder's.
listen, hey.
I know how to fix it.
you do?
now, go get ready for T. J.'s opening, and please put on that sexy, green dress that makes me want to tear it off you.
where are you? - My apartment.
nice elephants.
Thanks. Listen... - Sure you don't want to give me the full Skype tour?
georgia got Anne to spill the beans about my mother's run for the White House.
Jesus, Douglas!
I warned you.
georgia ambushed her, okay?
it was a very sophisticated line of questioning.
georgia doesn't even know how to spell sophisticated.
well, it's done, okay?
and now you need to stop it, or else, we're both screwed.
make yourself at home, Bud.
I'm here for T. J.'s dinner.
Admiral Taft was right.
you look fantastic for a woman who's just been around the world, not to mention getting called into the sit room your first day back.
Yeah, I just assumed.
no, why else would you be rubbing elbows with the commander of the Pacific fleet?
you know the rules, Bud.
heard you paid a visit to the Chinese embassy, too.
I saw the DCM.
Oh, a back-channel meeting between the Chinese DCM and the American secretary of state.
whatever is going on must be as delicate as an ass pimple.
please tell me we didn't sink one of their ships.
we didn't sink one of their ships.
but one of their ships went down.
so, the only reason a downed Chinese vessel would matter-- if it was close to our waters.
chinese got a downed sub near our shore. Holy son of a bitch.
you are something.
God forbid one of their sons was stuck down there.
crew's still alive?
not for long.
baking in nuclear radiation.
and Garcetti won't lift a greasy finger.
this is perfect.
to get your campaign out of the barn, you need a reason to leave that administration.
all right, now, with Elaine Barrish in charge,
america is a country that saves lives, even if they are Chinese.
now, that could be the narrative of your exit.
no, it can't.
the situation is classified, Bud.
Yeah, well, these things have a way of leaking out.
no one can know about this, Bud, I mean it, and you've done enough leaking for this week.
Oh, you saw that, huh?
honestly, I can't remember the last time I saw you cry.
who is she-- this flack you must have hired?
no man alive could get you to cry on national television.
has to be a woman, obviously someone you're sleeping with.
Ah, she swears I'll get a bump out of it.
bud, first rule of D. C.
never hire anyone from L. A. Is this because Jubal said you can't be involved in my campaign?
no, it doesn't matter what the polls say.
we're still divorced.
we always had our ups and downs.
are you that desperate to get back in the White House?
I told you I wasn't giving up on you, and I will follow you wherever you go, Sugar.
T. J. will be home soon.
Congratulations.
it's an angle no one else thought to take.
good work.
how do you know about that?
I'm deep inside the Hammond camp. Have been for weeks.
what I hear you have is too thin to run.
I have enough, Susan. - See, that's the problem.
it's my story, not yours.
I have a prior claim.
I'm, I'm light-years ahead of you.
now, if that were true, you'd have published already.
journalism is about quality, not speed.
people come to this paper, they read at length about something important to American political life.
takes them all of breakfast to get through it, and when they're done, they are better informed citizens of a democracy.
300, 000 people read this paper.
when I post, I'll get ten million direct views.
Elaine Barrish is running, and I broke it.
and you'll be a blogger who broke a headline, not a journalist who reported a story.
you'll get views, of course, but neither you nor this paper will get an ounce of prestige from it.
a story takes effort, time.
it takes reporting.
look, I can include the Anne stuff in my piece.
you'll have contributed.
I'll have contributed to your glory maybe.
that's not good enough.
there is nothing to stop me from running this story right now.
I'll get Alex to give you an additional reporting credit.
no. You'll bring me in on it completely.
no way.
you teach me the longer game, and when we publish, we split the credit 50-50.
I get half the byline.
that's not going to happen.
so you'd rather I just upload that tonight, then?
tell you what.
saturday's dead for traffic.
I'm much better off posting this first thing Monday morning.
Anne, be careful getting out of the limo， cause those photographers love to get a beaver shot.
Thanks, Margaret.
you know, I'd like to argue, but in fact she's probably right.
I am.
would you make me another martini, please?
sure. - Mother.
well, he's on payroll.
as a sober partner.
happy to.
just don't sen me for oxycodone.
that was my beast.
Oh, charming.
chill it till my teeth hurt, huh?
guys, I just, um... I just want to tell you guys how much tonight means to me.
I know you all had doubts, but...
I really feel like this is the beginning of a whole new, good chapter of my life, so...
about tonight, son, I'm afraid I can't go.
Mindy Meyer got you crying on Letterman tonight?
well, this has nothing do with her.
I wouldn't anymore attend this thing than I'd watch someone toss a baby seal into the jaws of an orca.
that's about as much chance as T. J. has, keeping straight in a nightclub.
tell me, when did you decide to write me off?
you have a serious problem, son, and you just keep adding fuel to the fire.
Oh, well, maybe if I was a pussy-hound like you, then I'd get a little compassion.
you never believed in me.
ever since I came out, ever since...- Oh, w-what?
you think I care who you sleep with?
T. J. you could have married your childhood sweetheart and done it missionary style for 50 years.
you'd still be an addict.
okay, Bud, you've made your point.
you are not going.
now, if you'd just stuck with the piano...
with this club, I finally have something that's mine.
yours?
you couldn't squeeze the money from me or your mama, so you went running to Dougie.
so much for our little secret?
could I just say something?
Oh, Jesus. Bad idea, sweetie.
now, these past three weeks,
T. J. has been really committed to his sobriety and he's doing an excellent job with the club.
I think you guys would be really impressed to see the guest list that are coming tonight, and it's all because of your son.
well, and who, pray tell?
Henry Kissinger, Desmond Tutu?
um, what's-his-name - from The Voice, uh, the congressman from Ohio.
no, oh, Gunn-- oh, no.
Yeah, that-that's him.
Really?
that's what all this is about?
that's why you're buzzing 100 million miles an hour?
are you two together?
of course not.
just let me explain. I...
no, I think this once I agree with your father.
going tonight is a really terrible idea.
wow, you, you always manage to abandon me when I need you the most.
when did this become my fault?
he's the one who cheated on his wife behind her back.
he's the one who said he loved you and then disappeared when it got tough.
I'm the one who found you... ...barely alive.
I hope you're not expecting me to thank you for that.
because I never will.
all right, well, I think it's time that we all head out.
no, no, no, no, stay, all of you.
no one really gives a shit.
come on.
every time I have stood by and lifted you up and made excuses for you, and it hasn't worked, not once.
I'm done, sweetheart. I am spent.
I hope tonight is a huge success.
holy shit.
just stay out of any TV shot, okay?
okay.
how could they do this-- your mother's cronies?
this is my life, my career, anything I've ever cared anything about.
I mean, God, they're destroying everything.
Sean, I know it sucks, but this is an opportunity for you to finally b-be free.
there's no more sneaking around, no more being hidden.
Hey, I know, I know this is a scary thing.
I went through the same thing.
Oh, come on.
you came out as a kid.
you weren't blackmailed into it.
you had your, your mother, your father, the whole country rallying around your courage.
you think this country is gonna applaud me for breaking my wife's heart, huh, for lying to everyone?
you can do this, Sean, I promise.
we can do this together.
come here.
don't touch me!
Yeah, we had sex, T.J. Big deal.
I was lonely, and, yeah, it felt good, especially if I kept my eyes closed and it was fine while it was happening, but I always left here feeling disgusted with myself.
no, y-y-you don't mean that.
I'm not like you, all right?
I've got a life, a career.
I'm not some pathetic American punch line.
this life of yours-- or whatever you want to call it-- may be okay for you, but I want more.
if it ain't the man of the hour.
good-looking on the VIP pass.
please, you're my guest of honor.
all right.
but you been out of the game.
might want to take it slow.
georgia Gibbons won't back off the story.
she's determined to break your mother's run for the presidency.
isn't she your second source?
not for the kind of reporting she does.
I'll have to run my story first
not the piece I wanted, but at least it will appear in an actual newspaper.
what do I tell my mother?
tell her to draft her letter of resignation.
otherwise, Garcetti's gonna read about it in the Globe.
that girl is smarter than she lets on.
she actually tried to bully me into sharing a byline.
and you said no?
uh, yeah.
are you kidding me?
you... you'd rather kill my mother's campaign than share a credit?
you would be derailing a woman's first real shot at the presidency.
aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself here?
my mother can win.
okay? I've seen how her numbers stack up against Garcetti's.
if you can just keep a lid on this long enough for us to build an organization.
why would I do that?
because... you want her to win.
you want her to win!
you could've killed her campaign weeks ago.
because after all those years of tearing her down, she has finally become the politician that you want her to be.
Jesus, Douglas, I'm gonna blush.
you don't just want her to win for noble reasons.
you live with your sister.
look at all you sacrifice for your career.
and for what?
so that you could have some ancient Pulitzer collecting dust in the lobby of the Globe?
tell me you don't want a shiny new one to place right next to it.
you want it as bad as I want to be White House Chief of Staff, and like it or not, in order for our dreams to come true, my mother's have to come true first.
it's a rocket ship.
come here, buddy.
it's way past your bedtime.
do me a solid, okay? - Okay.
get your mommy to tuck you in? - Okay.
kiss?
all right. I love you. - Good night, Trevor.
good night.
you want to talk to me?
come on in.
it's been obvious for some time that I am out of step with this administration.
and what happened today made that even more clear.
I am running against you.
I've reached out to a few donors and done some polling, and I will resign in 48 hours, after... we have saved those men together.
the president who leaves those sailors on the ocean floor deserves to be dethroned, and you know that better than anybody.
the people chose you to lead this country, not Collier, not me.
you.
I ought to fire you right on the spot, you know that?
you won't.
knowing you're gonna run against me, that gives me a hell of an advantage, Elaine.
and don't for one minute think I won't use it.
good.
I want you at your fighting weight when I thrash you.
get Samson and her team up here, the Joint Chiefs and Admiral Taft.
wake them up if you have to.
don't you look dashing.
my boy's new club.
tonight's the big red-carpet shindig.
I told you that was a bad idea.
Yeah, well... you also said there was gonna be a "tear bump," Mindy, and, uh,
I saw those new favorability numbers that your office sent over, and they look a lot like my old numbers.
bud, I can't help you if you're not gonna follow my advice.
Yeah, well... I wasn't planning on it anymore, so...
I think we should call it quits, professionally... and personally.
now, look, you're a doll, and I'm sure you're very good at what you do, but in my experience, the American people have a pretty good nose for sniffing out the truth, and...
if I'm going to, uh... rehabilitate myself and lose my image as a womanizer, it's best I stop being one first.
sorry, honey.
that means you're off the menu.
been looking all over for you.
Jesus, T.J. Three weeks under your belt.
Ah... T. J. T. J.come on, I'm getting you out of here.
Oh, is that really what you want to do, Gunnie?
Gunnie the druggie from Appalach-ey who stole his grandma's oxy to dull the trailer-park tedium?
that's the last thing in the world that you want to do right now is leave.
that's just the drugs talking.
is it?!
I bet there's a hundred girls down there you'd give your left arm to sleep with, huh?
this ain't no fairy tale, brother. This is the real thing.
you don't have to turn back into some backwoods hick.
and I'm gonna need a right-hand man when this club takes off, but my guy can't be a boonie, he's got to be an A-lister.
so who do you want to be for the rest of your life, Gunner?
you want to be the guy who babysat T. J. Hammond until he got sober?
or do you want more?
congressman Reeves, how do you explain voting for a bill you and your party swore you'd block?
well, politics is all about compromise.
and thanks to compromise, 25 million impoverished children just got the Christmas gift they deserve.
now, if you'll excuse me, there are two children in Akron who just asked Santa to bring their daddy home.
because I love this newspaper and I will do everything in my power to postpone its demise,
I'll give in to your blackmail, as despicable as it is.
and I might have even done the same thing at your age.
I consider that a compliment.
I would've been wrong, too.
so... partners?
if you want to share a byline with me, you better be ready to earn it.
every word you type will be true.
okay.
show me your notes.
Hey, Gunner, where's my son?
where is my son？!
Sam! Find him!
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
somebody help me!
Sam, call an ambulance!
Aw, geez...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, son.
holy son of a bitch.
so 100 men are trapped at the bottom of the ocean, getting slowly cooked by nuclear radiation?
I am running against you, and I will resign after we have saved those men.
this is how it works,
you help me by giving me everything I need to know about your mother's plan.
you came to me, now, let's remember.
there is a tsunami of bullshit that comes with being in my family.
we're gonna turn Sean Reeves.
your tactics disgust me.
you're already involved.
congressman Reeves is having an affair with your son, Thomas.
you have a serious problem, and you just keep adding fuel to the fire.
Sam, call an ambulance!
the winches are lowered now, and we believe the salvage teams are about to arrive at depth.
these divers are from the Navy's elite Mobile Unit One out of Hawaii.
tonight, they risk their lives for 100 Chinese strangers, stuck in 600 feet of water, 13 miles off the coast of San Diego.
the waiting's almost over now.
it's not just the lives of our Navy divers and the Chinese crew...
I think we all know what's at stake here.
approaching with cable number one.
ten meters and closing.
five meters.
4 3
2 1
they want to keep him sedated, until all the cocaine's out of his system.
I think they gave him too much.
mother!
like I don't have enough anxiety just with the overdose.
dad, Mom... can I talk to you for a second?
uh... So between the security guards and the three EMTs, there's a total of six witnesses that we know of.
I spoke to Gary at the press office...
he's already getting calls. We cannot cover this one up.
now, he'll know what to do.
we are not hiring a fixer.
between phone videos and pictures, or some hospital flunky wanting to release his medical records...
call Susan Berg.
mom, that is... - Tell her we want to meet.
I don't have time to argue with you about this, Douglas.
just do it.
he's my twin brother. I'd like to be here when he wakes up.
and I would give anything to do the same thing, but you and I have to help him in other ways.
I'll stay with him.
now, you do what you gotta do, but I'm gonna be right here by his side.
they're going to release him in a day or so... I want him to move in with us.
would you and Anne set up the guest room for him and get the house ready?
we'll make his room perfect.
she meant dump the booze.
I mean get his room ready.
and yes, get rid of whatever... substances.
just like last January, after rehab.
Yeah, a lot of good that did.
little shit's never gonna learn.
an allergic reaction?
Yes.
to an antibiotic that they prescribed for T. J.and he went into anaphylactic shock.
so they rushed him to the ER, and, uh, got some fluids in him, some epinephrine...
thankfully, he's doing much better now.
okay... Are the hospital records available?
those are confidential.
you two don't really expect me to believe this.
it's not important that you believe it.
what's important is that you write down exactly what I'm telling you.
I don't transcribe press releases.
it's my job to discern the truth, and what you just said doesn't have a whiff of it.
Susan, I would like you to write it anyway.
I... won't use my reputation or that of my paper to quell the speculation surrounding T. J.
I just... I... I won't do it.
and if I were willing to breach National Security... - Mom...
...and give you a story in exchange for this?
I'm listening.
I want you to know that as Secretary of State...
...I would never do anything to deceive the American public.
but as a mother... I would do anything to help my son.
there is a Chinese submarine lying on the floor of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego.
the Chinese are pretending it's not there-- that they weren't caught spying on us
and they're willing to let their own men die.
president Garcetti is doing everything he can to rescue them.
Douglas is headed out there now.
there's room on the plane, and you would be the only press person on the ground with unlimited access to the rescue operation.
didn't know you were all here... - Annie, babe.
you, um, you remember Susan Berg, right?
we've met.
nice to see you again.
Hi, Annie.
Hey, what are these?
Oh, stuff for, um, T.J.'s room.
sorry... I feel like I'm interrupting something.
you're not interrupting.
Douglas and Susan were just getting ready to fly to San Diego, isn't that right?
cool.
Hi, Alice... Well, did he say when or where?
okay... Yeah. No, I'll tell her.
um, DCM Han. He wants to meet with you immediately.
he's on his way over.
I asked you not to get involved, Madam Secretary.
and you do the opposite.
you said you could not get involved, Lee Bao.
we are saving your men.
you're making a mistake.
your government must cease all rescue operations.
the hardware is too valuable.
we cannot have the CIA poking around our technology.
your hardware is your priority, Lee Bao?
the truth is, Elaine... orders have been communicated.
if you try to rescue them, the crew will be forced to scuttle the ship.
you mean, releasing the nuclear material off of California?
22 million people live along that coastline.
are you insane?
there is nothing I can do.
you can get Tong on the line.
now. You are not setting off an underwater dirty bomb off our coast.
this is above Tong.
who is above your President?
navy Intelligence.
the only way to avoid catastrophe is for the United States to stand down.
you had a productive morning.
got my piece?
it's amazing, isn't it?
uh... the sub story is, it's amazing.
a nuclear-powered Chinese warship marooned off the California coast, lives hanging in the balance-- this is gonna be everywhere, and, you know, we had it first.
in fact, maybe it's such big news, that no one will notice the story about Thomas Hammond's "adverse reaction to antibiotics.
I'm your editor, though.
it's my job to notice.
spit it out. I'm in a hurry.
right... Hopping on a State Department jet with Douglas Hammond.
I have access. I have a vantage-point on a huge international incident no other reporter has.
I never thought I would have to accuse you of being in the back pocket of the Hammond family.
then don't.
you're saying these stories have nothing to do with one another?
don't over-think it, Alex.
you bitch about losing eyeballs... I just brought a few more back to our dear, old Globe.
and I'll bring even more when I report the submarine being raised.
so just keep your eye on the inbox.
...President Hammond is a dog, and only a fool "would fault a dog for rooting in the trash."
but a First Lady wielding an intellect, drive "and individuality unlike any before her "ought to know better.
what sort of example does she set?
standing by her dog husband with a sculpted smile, "responding to the parade of finger-pointing bimbos with her craven trill of 'no comment' after 'no comment'...
this is not opinion. It's judgment.
the First Family is phony good-old-boy-ism and empty "women first" chatter...
this... is very clever.
it is also... very mean.
you're better than this.
because it isn't worthy?
or because a female opinion gets different scrutiny?
bullshit.
there are eight opinion columnists at this paper, all men.
you'll have to excuse me now.
the long-term damage to the maritime industry ONE could reach easily into tens of billions of dollars.
and for the population along the Western Seaboard, health effects are hard to predict, but nevertheless certain.
that's a hell of a thank you for trying to rescue their men.
Mr. President... We agree that the threat is a bluff.
collier: Even if they meant to bluff, they've said it now.
the Chinese have to follow through to save face.
can we all just agree that the rescue attempt is off the table?
chinese Naval Intelligence is not in charge of the Chinese military.
and I get the sense that President Tong needs to reassert control over these Admirals...
you get the sense?
they were caught spying off our shores.
we're attempting to do the humane thing by rescuing their crew...
and now we're expected to stand down because this bunch of thugs
who are not even in charge-- are threatening us.
we didn't pick this fight.
the Chinese did.
I'm sure they don't want to let their Admirals start a Third World War just to save face.
no. Elaine's right.
we tell them now-- and in no uncertain terms-- that this will not stand.
Mr. President... - Fred, I appreciate your opinion, but this is exactly the type of decision people elected me to make.
keep the rescue ships in place. - yes sir
Barry, schedule an address from the Oval in the next hour.
Yes, sir.
Elaine... I'd like you to help me write the speech.
Yes, sir.
you're sure fond of that bathroom.
what's that mean?
Oh, nothing.
Regularity's the first thing that goes when you age.
so enjoy it while you can.
okay, you do the extreme room makeover and I'll case the place for drugs.
you think really think T. J. keeps drugs inside the Secretary of State's house?
well, of course he does, he's an addict.
I wouldn't be surprised if somewhere in here he hasn't hidden a go-go boy.
Oh, let me help you with that.
Oh, yeah, thanks.
"Grass-fed filet"?
the spaghetti alla panna's better.
your whole life has been like this, hasn't it?
first class, chauffeurs and private chefs.
bodyguards and bomb-sniffing dogs, paparazzi at my junior prom.
okay, I get it.
yeah? Did someone film you dancing to the Backstreet Boys before you were old enough to realize tuxedo shorts weren't cool?
I remember that video.
Saturday Night Live did a great spoof.
what was it like... growing up in the White House?
thank you.
this is starting to sound a little reportery.
no, I'm just curious, personally.
I mean, I,we, every reporter in DC spent those eight years peering into your family, trying to figure out what made your parents tick.
what makes your parents tick?
I... - Exactly.
when you're a kid, they're all you know. So who knows?
I can tell you this much.
all the stuff that people obsessed about over them, all the good things people wrote, all the nasty shit, all the movies, the insider tell-alls, none of it captured them.
you least of all.
Lester just called.
I think you know what he said.
you questioned my integrity. I wanted a second opinion.
I thought that you wanted to be a journalist, not a noisemaker.
he's a pig, Hal.
and she's his willing accomplice.
all the men in this town are afraid to write the truth about her because they don't want to be labeled anti-feminist.
well they won't be afraid to write about her anymore.
let the Elaine Hammond pile-on begin.
your piece runs tomorrow, first page of the Op-ed.
Lester's running it?
congratulations, Susan.
you got what you wanted.
I hope you're ready for it.
I have no idea where these hands came from.
not my hands.
mine are Pa's.
they're not your mother's either.
I'm not sure who they belong to.
I remember that first year in the White House was the worst year of my life.
everything I always dreamed of, the job I'd coveted ever since I was a young man, I finally had it.
and I was miserable as hell.
a fourth of my term had passed and I hadn't accomplished a single thing that I'd set out to do.
and I used to walk the halls at night, stare up at the faces of my predecessors and think to myself,"Every one of them is a better man than me.
and then one night, out of the East Room...
I hear this most glorious sound.
I poke my head in, and there you are, eight years old, playing some kind of classical piece so effortlessly.
you turned around when you heard me, and you let out a crazy laugh, and you went skipping off down the hallway.
and after that,
I used to hide around the corner from the East Room just to listen to you play.
it was something so simple, but it brought me so much peace.
I don't know why I never told you that.
these hands.
they're not my hands, T.J. They're yours.
you do not come spying in our backyard and make threats.
it's tempting to soft-pedal, but speeches don't come bolder than this.
and your words should match it, sir.
history will judge me by this.
if this goes south, my entire presidency just... melts away.
if it goes well, you'll be a hero... and you'll be unbeatable.
either way, it's the right thing to do, Mr. President.
you know, Elaine... Thank you.
...this moment, this is why I asked you to run with me in the first place.
you wouldn't have been elected.
you needed the conservative votes in our party, which Collier brought.
good luck, Mr. President.
thank you.
ten seconds, sir.
in five, four, three...
my fellow Americans, as many of you know, a Chinese nuclear submarine lies 13 miles off the coast of Southern California.
as of last night, on my orders, a Navy salvage group is headed there to rescue the 100 Chinese sailors aboard.
however, we have since learned that the crew were given orders to destroy their own ship;
and the released radiation would wreak havoc upon the entire Western seaboard.
let me be clear, we would consider it nothing less than an act of war against the United States.
you do not come spying in our backyard and make threats.
when I was your age, I was the original girl gone wild.
dancing on tabletops in clubs all over town.
why did you settle down?
it was my second husband.
it was Elaine's stepfather, Dale Barrish.
he treated me like a queen, but he was just boring as shit.
you didn't love him?
well, there's all kinds of love, isn't there?
I mean, I loved his kindness and I loved what he did for Elaine...
he taught her the preamble to the Constitution before she was five.
he just saw abilities in her that I just wasn't capable of seeing.
but it just wasn't the head-over-heels love kind of thing, you know?
that cushion you're sitting on, I bet there's a zipper on it.
Yep, sure does.
that little shit.
Oh, my God, that filet it could turn vegetarians.
you leaving all that?
knock yourself out.
maybe just a little.
really good.
what's so funny?
watching you down my food.
Annie loves to eat, too.
it's just, uh, well, now she's gotta worry about...
what, squeezing into a wedding dress?
Yeah. - Not really on my radar.
so you and your boyfriend...? - Split up.
he's back to being just my editor now.
so... tell me more about Anne.
like what?
what do you think after having been under that magnifying glass your whole life?
it must be tough to be a journalist sometimes, acting like you're someone's friend one minute, and the next you've got them over a barrel.
Oh, you put yourself over that barrel.
do you ever stop playing people?
you're talking to me about playing people?
your mother lied to my face, said she wasn't running for president.
you know what? Don't take it so personally.
you've had it out for her for the last 15 years.
you've made a career out of trying to drive her name into the ground.
and now you're riding her coattails to the White House.
when I became a journalist, I was taught that my job was to keep politicians honest.
and who was keeping you honest?
I think it's best if we want to make it to San Diego without some sort of double-homicide situation to declare your mother off-limits.
sure I can't interest either of you two in a glass of wine?
sure. - Me, too.
here, cocaine.
dump it.
these look like they have little signs on them.
are those bunnies?
uh, I think they're unicorns.
dump them.
now, this... I can think of a more interesting way to get rid of.
you're joking.
some of my friends in California get this from their doctors.
I mean, it can be therapeutic.
all right, I... I haven't smoked since college.
I'm not doing it now with my fiancs' grandmother.
you know, sometimes after the show, somebody would give us a tip of a couple of reefers.
us girls would stay up all night drinking, smoking, sexually experimenting.
this is a terrible idea.
Anne, sweetheart, you could stand a couple of terrible ideas.
more wine, sir?
no, thank you. I think we're all good here.
I have enough trouble holding my tongue when I'm sober.
we're off the record.
say whatever you want.
listen, the way that I came at you before-- way out of line.
it's only fair.
I should be able to take character impeachment as easily as I give it, right?
honestly, though, there was a part of me that loved some of what you wrote.
the stuff about my dad-- how it used to drive him bat-shit crazy.
I campaigned for him in college, you know?
drove four hours to see him speak.
it was one of the most inspirational moments of my life.
and you know what the best part was?
your mom.
it opened my eyes that a woman could be that strong and independent and still be...
I don't know, a wife and mother.
what was yours like? Your mother.
she died a few years ago.
breast cancer.
uh... why?
you may know more about my own mother than I do, and I don't seem to know anything about yours.
it just doesn't seem right.
she didn't care for my columns about your mom.
I thought I was being principled.
she thought I was just doing it to set myself apart from the world.
she may have been right.
I thought I was being principled when I told you about my mother's run.
we all make mistakes.
I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.
we need to make an emergency stop in Dallas to wait out some thunderstorms.
but we promise to get you back in the air to San Diego as soon as possible.
bright side.
we can finish this bottle.
thank you.
I know it's a shoe box, but there's lots of glass.
and, uh, I'm the youngest staffer with four walls.
like Virginia Woolf said,"All a writer needs is a room of one's own." Right?
well, I'm happy for you, sweetheart.
are you?
I came here to celebrate your new office, so I... Let's not do this.
mom, please just...
say whatever the hell you're thinking so I don't have to spend all of lunch trying to decipher it.
I'm proud of you.
uh, you've accomplished a great deal.
But?
I just don't think that Elaine Hammond is the ogre that you present.
no, and it seems naive that someone still in their 20s, someone not yet married, uses the infidelities of someone's marriage as a lightning rod.
now, I think, once you've learned how much work it takes, you'll be less...
I am the only woman with an op-ed column at this paper.
Yes, well, you'd never know it by the way you shred Elaine Hammond.
do you really hate her that much, or is she just an easy mark to get this?
what a spiteful thing to say.
this is resentment.
you cut your career short, so how dare I become successful in mine.
no, I left medicine to have a family.
and if I hadn't done that, I think it's fairly unlikely you would be here today.
I'm sorry. I-I... I didn't come into town for this.
I came to see you and to have a nice lunch.
so let's go. Please.
I'm supposed to meet Liz at 2: 00.
you scheduled a half-hour for us to eat?
she's painting the townhouse.
she asked me to come by and take a look.
I mean, second-year residents can't make their own schedule.
go eat with Liz.
talk shop.
Oh, Suse.
no. Really.
well, okay.
I wish my mother were here.
she at least would have had the sense to smuggle in a flask.
come on. You've done everything you could, sugar.
now it's up to God and the doctors...
and the Chinese, all of whom-- let's face it-- work in mysterious ways.
I don't think I ever fully realized until today how much pressure you were under.
well, after spending the last 12 hours watching over T. J.
I could say the same thing to you.
he wouldn't be lying here if we had given the same devotion and passion to his well-being that we gave to our political careers.
apples and oranges, sugar.
as soon as he started to go downhill in high school, I should have packed up and left DC.
we've been through this.
no, we made a choice, Bud.
we put our goals for this country ahead of the well-being of our child, and that is a decision we have to live with for the rest of our lives.
Hey, that, uh, congressman, Sean Reeves, uh, you got pretty upset when his name came up last night.
is he the one that changed his vote on the Child Protection Act?
right around Christmas, as I recall.
he and T. J. were having an affair.
what?
Sean ended up going back to his wife, and it broke T. J.'s heart.
someone found out they were seeing each other and threatened to out Sean if he didn't change his vote.
so he did.
who was it?
a Democrat.
one of our own, if you can believe that.
tell me who it was, sugar.
you know, just so if I see him at a cocktail party, I can spill a glass of wine on him.
okay, hold on a minute.
you actually have a Backstreet Boys playlist?
Ooh, I don't know if anybody told you, but, um...
I still got those dance moves.
I might even have my tuxedo shorts somewhere.
you should wear them to your wedding.
Yeah, uh, I don't know if Annie would like that so much.
she's a designer, so God forbid that I clash with the table settings.
um... I showed you mine.
now you show me yours.
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
uh, let's see.
deadline" playlist.
Um,"Treadmill" playlist.
Insomnia" playlist.
Yes. Sorry. That is my life.
who's Alex, and why does he get his own playlist?
your ex.
sorry.
we were living together, and, um, he had an affair with a woman we both work with, so I moved out.
I tell you a secret?
I think that you're a little drunk, so watch yourself.
drunk secrets are the best.
I had sex on this plane the last time I was on it.
with my dad?
Jesus, no.
with another journalist.
I was trying to get over my ex, but, of course, it made things worse.
I know she doesn't like me.
Oh... She's never liked me.
she doesn't think that I am good enough for her... precious prince-of-the-world son.
do you know what she talked about the first time we met?
douglas's ex-girlfriend.
the Lauren bitch.
Lauren's a Rhodes Scholar.
no wonder she loved her. She was a carbon copy of her.
you know, I like this Anne-- she's my kind of gal.
you ought to let her out more often.
and the phone calls.
she calls him at 3: 00 in the morning just to chat.
they don't think it's weird.
I mean, I don't care where they work.
that's weird.
well, now, don't get carried away.
that's my grandson you're talking about.
she will always be number one on his speed dial.
I'll have to live with being number two.
no, absolutely not.
you can't settle for that.
are you kidding me?
you got to say to him,"I am number one."
now, say that.
I'm number one.
no, louder.
and stick your boobs out when you say it.
I am number one.
I am number one.
there you go. There's hope for you yet.
now, will you please stop bogarting that thing?
nice to see you've redecorated.
president Turner was one tasteless son of a bitch.
Plus, he tore out my bowling alley.
never trust anyone who doesn't enjoy bowling.
how are you, Mr. President?
Mr. President.
welcome home.
thank you.
have a seat, please.
thanks for setting this up, Fred, on such short notice.
sure.
listen, Bud, I should probably tell you before you even get started
whatever information or insight you have into our current situation, it's not likely to change my mind.
about the Chinese sub?
go rescue it. It's what I'd do if I were still in the chair.
you said you had intel.
I do, Fred, and it's important.
you'll see.
generally speaking, Paul, and with all due respect,
I think you're slick, uncommitted and opportunistic.
you lack the backbone to be a great leader, but you're not without your principles.
I guess this is the part where I say,"Thank you, Bud."
old Fred here, on the other hand, well, I'll be damned if I know what makes him tick.
then again, having run the CIA as long as you did, I guess any sort of principles, any kind of human compunction, would just get in the way.
you have any idea what I was doing while you were dodging the draft in the Coast Guard?
I served this country with honor for over three decades.
you wouldn't know honor if it sucked your cock and stroked your balls, Fred.
that's a beautiful metaphor.
bud, why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
the Child Protection Act.
last December, when you were teaching your boy to ski, he turned Congressman Sean Reeves by threatening to disclose the man's sexual orientation, which is not as publicly advertised.
just fell in our laps.
well, would you swear that on oath before a House Oversight Committee?
he used your name, Mr. President.
he told folks that the scheme was your redheaded stepchild.
he's just pissed because his queer son was having an affair with Reeves.
or were you going to just leave that part out, Mr. President?
no, I was getting there.
Yeah. But I wanted to do this first.
you son of a bitch!
I'll kick your... - Fred.
Jesus. - Son of a bitch!
guys, that's it. That's enough. That's enough!
you harm my family again, and I swear to ever-loving God I will wipe your existence from the face of this Earth.
probably ought to get some ice on that.
drunk secret.
I, uh... proposed to Anne while we were on Ecstasy.
okay.
that beats joining the mile-high club.
and we've been planning our wedding for two years because I'm not really sure either one of us is ready to commit.
do you love her?
Yeah, totally.
but...?
it's like... it's like you put on this, um, expensive, tailored suit, right, and everybody tells you how great you look in it, but it doesn't really fit quite right unless you stand perfectly still.
love has never fit quite right for me.
I was always certain about my job-- maybe too certain-- but not with love.
you never settled, you know?
that-that takes courage.
you have never compromised in your writing, so why should you compromise in your personal life?
there's a flip side no one tells you about.
you wake up one day...
and you realize that while you were busy being brazen, making a name for yourself, everyone made a life.
and then you're not uncompromising; you're just sad.
bullshit.
you... are gorgeous.
you're smart.
you are...
a bitch who makes a living ripping other people's lives to shreds in public?
Yes. And...
sexy.
I-I wish that I had some of your courage.
look at you, Douglas.
you're the youngest chief of staff in State...
wait.
mom.
Oh, sweetie.
where... where am I?
you're in the hospital.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
I-I didn't mean for this to happen.
I wasn't... I wasn't trying to hurt myself.
don't worry about any of that.
go back to sleep.
it's all going to be okay.
how is he?
what happened to you?
Oh, nothing.
he just woke up for a second.
right.
I'll stay with him now.
you need to get back to the Situation Room.
won't be long before they make contact with that sub.
you know, it's freezing in here.
they either need to bring him another blanket or turn up the temperature.
right, right.
and ask the nurses to have something for him to eat when he wakes up, you know?
Yeah. He needs to get some solid food in him.
that's all right. Just leave him with me.
now, go. Go on.
now, most people, when they get high, they get the munchies.
I get the drunkies.
no, no, I didn't mean to say that.
that was wrong. I get the drinkies.
okay, what exactly is this?
it's delicious.
it's Turkish delight.
the Turkish ambassador sent it over.
he's got a crush on Elaine.
it's a little on the nose if you ask me.
don't do it, honey.
don't do it to yourself anymore.
I'm just using the bathroom.
Hey, who you talking to? Huh?
I was a showgirl.
you think I don't know what some of the girls had to do to fit into our skimpy costumes?
you think I don't notice you getting up halfway through every meal and coming back from the ladies' room light-headed and reeking of breath mints?
there's a lot of looking the other way in this family, babe, but not by me.
I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding.
okay.
you don't have to come clean to me, but you got to talk to Dougie about it.
you know, let him get you some help.
the waiting's almost over now.
it's not just the lives of our Navy divers and the Chinese crew.
I think we all know what's at stake here.
unit One, you're clear for attach.
repeat-- clear for attach.
approaching with cable number one.
ten meters and closing.
five meters.
three.
two.
one.
cable one attached, Topside.
cable two attached.
command, this is Topside.
we're getting a pulsed message from the sub, but it makes no sense.
send it through, Topside.
what is it, code?
it's alphabetized Chinese.
it means,"Xie xie.
thank you.
cable four attached.
all points secure, Topside.
pull her up.
this? You know, when I was fighting over that game room.
Oh, is that scar from a knife?
Yeah.
I wonder what it's like being stabbed.
have you ever stabbed anyone?
I'm no different from the rest.
what does it feel like? Stabbing?
feels like shit.
you're not yourself when you do it.
Yeah. I can't imagine it.
that's why you shouldn't look into their eyes...
if you do, it will haunt you for the rest of your life.
nobody will understand...
I can't get it out of my mind.
Hey, who did you stab?
what's wrong with you today?
this is the bird's eye view of the apartment complex.
the total sales profit will be around 451.8 billion won and the cost of land, construction, and selling...
all those will be replaced by beautiful apartments.
a shopping mall over there and a subway line there.
imagine the scale of money selling 1, 500 units.
we'll get at least five hundred if everything works out well.
five hundred units? I can't imagine it, boss.
it could be more.
but it won't be easy driving out the locals.
the landlords probably heard about the development by now.
they'll expect compensation.
there are some defrauders.
you think you can handle it?
Yes, I'll do it, boss.
good.
if you help me dig those grounds,
I'll give you fifty units.
really, boss? - Of course.
I'm here because of you.
I'll make sure it happens.
your scenario was good. Why didn't you do it sooner?
pardon me?
what happened? I guess all those interviews paid off.
the characters seemed real and the story's good.
Oh, really?
let's do it.
what? - Let's get the actors together and start tomorrow.
thank you, sir. Thank you.
her beautiful mind caressed my heart.
lady, sell it.
shit, you're holding up our construction business.
should we come by at night and bury her?
boss, let's do that. I know a good mountain for digging.
things will only get worse.
we'll pay you some extra.
how many times do I need to tell you. I can't sell it.
I lived here for 30 years and it's all I've got for my sons.
so your second son is a senior in high school?
excuse me?
boss, we couldn't find the owners of the five houses.
they're probably hiding.
that 5 area,
I think the Serpents' got them.
I guess they want a part in this too.
the matter's serious if it's the Serpents though.
my boys will find those five landlords soon.
as long as we find one, the rest will come out easy.
do it quietly. An all-out war isn't easy.
Yes, boss.
your guest has arrived.
Hey, Min-ho. Come here. - Hello, director KIM. Welcome.
Hi, nice to meet you.
I'm sorry to ask you to come when you must be so busy.
it's no problem.
I heard a lot about you from Byung-doo.
he seems very proud of you.
Really?
how's it coming along?
we'll go into shooting soon.
first of all, congratulations. - Thank you.
and thanks for casting my daughter.
she's good for the role.
Plus, Byung-doo helped me so much, it's the least I could do.
it'd better be a big hit.
Thanks.
you can count on me, boss.
make a blockbuster, Min-ho.
fighting!
she runs away when I approach her,
looks away when I glance at her.
time keeps passing by while.
I wonder if she knows how I feel she swifts by me, and though I try to ignore it, she flows me like the river, she's a rainbow over my heart.
I could run, I could fly if you come into my heart.
may I help you?
do you know where Ms. KANG Hyun-joo is?
she didn't come to work today.
I'm a friend of hers. Could you give this to her for me?
she's sick, so she's taking some days off.
Hyun-joo! Open the door. I said open the door!
come out!
open the door.
you'd better open the door or I'm gonna break in.
Hyun-joo!
is she okay?
the doctor will be here soon.
why didn't you call home if you were this sick?
I must say this is excellent although I made it.
I used to get beat to get the recipe right for this.
try it.
try just a bite then, for my sake.
why are you crying? Eat so you can recover.
what the...
I'm tired of waiting, Digger - Digger - Tired of waiting, Digger - Digger.
I'm so lonely tonight.
this is expensive, you know. 100% natural honey...
man, it's sweet!
it's sweet, ain't it?
there are lots of ants and digger bees in this mountain.
won't it be nice to see happens for a few days?
huh?
Where's are they?
good afternoon, boss.
did we get everything?
things got complicated, boss.
Why?
I was just working on those five and it seems Serpent's got the papers himself.
what? Serpent has them?
fucking son of a bitch.
what shall we do, boss?
kill them until they tell you where Serpent is.
Yes, boss.
who are you?
Mr. KIM, it's not polite to mess with others' business.
who the fuck are you?
your mother seemed ill.
who are you?
and isn't it danerous after dark for a pretty girl like your sister?
Byung-doo, what's wrong?
what's going on?
Sun-ok, hurry up and pack. We're leaving right now.
mom says she's not going. - What's happening?
I'll explain later. Stay at uncle's place for a few days.
Where's Byung-sik? - He hasn't come home in a couple of days.
hurry, what are you doing?
I'm not leaving my house.
what did you do this time?
it's not what you think. Just listen to me this once.
I can't deal with this anymore.
first it was cops, now we have to hide from gangsters?
we can manage on our own, go hide by yourself.
your bad example messed up Byung-sik as well.
shit!
who's gonna take care of Byung-sik and Sun-ok?
stop shouting at mom.
I won't ask you to take care of us, so get out!
okay, I'll leave, so do whatever you want.
where are they, boss?
call Jong-soo and tell him to send some boys over to my house.
Yes, boss.
Yes, boss. We'll take care of them.
Yes, boss.
we'll bury them as soon as we find out where they are.
okay, boss.
what did the boss say?
to finish everything tonight.
okay.
since they love land so much, we'll bury them.
we'll do what they did to our boys, when we find them.
of course. Can't believe we're going through all this trouble for Axe.
he shouldn't have got caught by them.
boss, won't we get something for rescuing all of them?
I'm sure we will as soon as the boss gets things settled.
you know, Axe is a fucking psycho.
remember when we went to collect money from Royal Billiards? Axe forgot to undig him afterwards.
fuck!
lighter, lighter.
when we went back the tide water had already reached right below his eyes. He could've died.
isn't he a dumb ass, boss?
it gets even better. When we got there, he looking up at me with these sad pleading eyes.
I was kind of hesitating to kill him.
then all of a sudden a stream of water shot out of nowhere.
you know what it was?
Eui-jung was pissing on him.
isn't that something?
he must've been pissing in his pants himself.
I'm sure he was, boss.
all those Mok-po bitches are in the past, boss.
you lying bitch...
stop the car!
fuck!
fucking, where's Serpent?
motherfucker!
stay still, bitch.
hurry, get him in the car.
this is Serpent's and these are the rest of the landlords'.
the land is open for construction now.
good job. You're ruthless.
what about the Serpents? They're resolved for good?
of course, boss.
after the authorization, we're set for good.
don't forget about my share, boss.
of course, you'll get your share.
cut! - It's a cut.
everybody, gather here. What's up with your jump?
it's very different from real life.
I know, boss.
hold on. - Practice!
everything nice and all, but actions seem too sophisticated.
can't we get it a bit more realistic?
realistic? How?
maybe you can take out that jumping round kick.
you said it was okay on the first round.
you should've said it earlier then.
now we have to change the whole routine.
this just isn't the type of action I was thinking of...
OK then, no jumping round kick.
what else?
I don't know what you want so tell me specifically.
Min-ho. - Yeah.
he's the martial arts choreographer?
Yeah, why?
Hi, I was just watching.
I'm sorry to butt in, but the fight doesn't seem real.
Yes.
Min-ho. Real gangsters don't fight like this.
Yeah.
Hey, Jong-soo! Come over here.
Yeah!
hurry up. - Yes, boss.
stand right here.
you see, a punch should always fly low.
keep it low and give it a sting at the end.
like this.
this is how you do it.
I'm fine but the crew seems to feel a bit uncomfortable.
I guess I made a mistake.
I was only trying to help.
I know, but they're all really sensitive right now with stress.
Yeah, then I'll head off.
I'm sorry. I'll call you soon when it's all over.
Yeah, good luck with the rest of the shooting.
Min-ho!
make something with a real Gangster spirit.
see you.
see you.
you're off early today.
Hey, it's been a while.
Yeah, how were you? You feel better now?
Yeah, I'm much better now.
good.
Hey, you don't seem happy to see me.
here, people are watching, hurry, take it.
actually, I went the book shop several times to see you.
but I couldn't say hi to you.
thought you'd feel uncomfortable.
but I'm glad you look better.
Oh yeah, thank you for the other day.
you're a good cook.
Yeah, then get sick again.
so I can cook for you again.
how do you like this place?
it's really nice to be out after working inside all day.
it's like another world, another life in there.
I'll take you to a better place next time.
I saw you wearing new shoes.
does it fit?
how did you know my size?
just an eye measurement.
I'm always receiving things from you.
what is it? What's the event?
nothing. I just wanted to celebrate something.
enjoy your cake.
what did you want to celebrate?
you remember you sent me a Lucky tree?
it blossomed today.
Really? That's really rare.
yeah I know, but it did.
if something good really happens, it's because of you.
I had fun today. Getting some fresh air...
you're a good conversationist, and smiled a lot too today.
you helped me.
I haven't had such a good time in a while.
Really?
Yeah. Next time, I'm buying.
OK!
cool. Won't you invite me for a cup of coffee?
coffee?
it's too late tonight. I'll make it for you next time.
okay. Man, I can't believe it's time to go already.
drive safely. And thanks for the flowers.
Yup.
Hyun-joo, hold on.
Hyun-joo, can I like you?
you still hate me?
no, it's just... I'm not sure...
Hyun-joo, if you want,
I can quit being a gangster.
to tell you the truth, I've never liked anyone but you.
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.
Congratulations. Seems like a hit. - Hey, thanks.
Min-ho.
you're here. - You did a great job.
everybody's talking about how good the movie it.
it's good. It's a good piece of work.
Really? You must work with me next time then.
thank you.
director! - Hey, Ji-ae. - Hello, Director. -Hi.
Congratulations. - Thank you for coming.
did Ji-ae cause you trouble?
no, she was great. It was tough for her too.
director, I think it's a hit.
everyone's talking about it.
Yeah.
I wish you best of luck. - Yes, thank you.
by the way, didn't you invite Byung-doo?
Oh, yes. I tried calling him, but he wouldn't pick up.
right, he's so busy these days with work.
I see.
I'll see you after the movie. Let's have a drink sometime.
sure.
have more.
I hope you like it.
it tastes exactly like when I had it in elementary.
I'm glad.
take some home with you. She's made plenty.
it's not worth taking home. Hyun-joo, come over often.
okay.
a tip for my sister-in-law, it tastes better with salt and suger.
Hey, you're embarrassing her.
it's my wishful thinking.
Byung-doo, you'd like that too.
you've become a different person ever since you've been dating her.
no I haven't.
your brother always talks about how pretty and smart you are.
Really?
I'm so happy you're with him.
he has a good heart.
always bringing all sorts of medicine.
you need to get well soon.
Yes, boss.
where are you?
I'm having dinner with my family.
so oblivious... - Pardon?
are you alright?
what kind of driving is that?
I'm sorry, I had a small drink...
I'm sorry.
what? You're driving drunk?
let me see your license.
I don't have one.
then let me see your ID.
I don't have that either.
no ID? What kind of person would drive without a license?
you know who I am?
I sure do.
Hello, attorney Choi!
long time no see.
who did you do it to?
go ahead and tell me.
Min-ho.
I took my boss.
Why? There must've been a reason for taking him.
you wouldn't do that to your boss for no reason.
you can't tell anyone about this...
how far does he know?
I didn't mention anything about you.
trust me, boss.
are you out of your mind?
how could you tell him?
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.
why did Sang-chul end up that way?
what will happen if your friend went about telling everyone?
he won't do such a thing, boss.
how can you be sure?
you did it, you clean it up.
look over here, good.
you're doing well. Okay, once more.
now, hold your fists, pose like a gangster.
smile a little more, a little more, good!
your characters are very real.
did you interview real gangsters?
not, especially.
I watched a lot of gangster movies like THE GODFATHER and SCARFACE.
I usually get inspiration from that movies.
I'm sorry, I should've called you.
why did you do that?
I trusted you when I told you that.
you shouldn't have done it if you considered me your friend.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, but...
sorry? What if this ruins me?
you don't give a fuck, do you?
Hey, listen to me. - Listen to what?
I thought hard about it and I figured it would be harmless.
everyone knows about the case and anyone could've done it.
you've watched it too. It's not about you.
I made it up.
think about it.
kim Min-Ho.
okay, let's say it was my mistake.
but gangsters can do anything to cover their mistakes.
you wondered what it'd be like being stabbed.
let me say just one thing...
shut up for the rest of your life. Okay?
can you do that?
Yes. I'll take it to my grave.
if something happens, I'm not going down alone, got it?
you trust him?
I don't.
he even made it into a movie.
I said I got it under control.
stop talking about it.
and start gathering boys for the model house.
if you can't do it because he's your friend, I'll do it.
what?
leave it up to me.
you son of a bitch, you stay out of this.
what do you mean, stay out of it, boss?
it's my business so you can stay out of it!
boss, this isn't just about you.
our whole family's on the line.
why are you covering for that fucking bastard?
will you take care of us, if we all get fucked up?
you son of of a bitch!
son of bitch!
I'll fucking shut you up.
didn't I say I got it under control, huh?
don't you ever mention that in front of me again.
long time no see, boss.
stop.
Yeah.
boss, how could you?
unlike our boss,
I don't know you very well,
ain't that so you pussy.
sorry to worry you, boss.
I got everything under control now.
don't make another mistake.
Yes, boss.
model house and sales start next week, so be prepared.
Yes, boss.
our boss saved you this time.
but we'll be watching you.
better keep your mouth shut.
we're on the same boat now.
Congratulations.
thank you for your help.
it's doing well. - Yes, I'm glad.
what was the competition rate for sales contract until yesterday?
it was 50 to 1 until this morning.
boss! - I knew it would do well.
we brought more boys.
Really? Set them over there to lift the atmosphere.
okay. - Okay, boss.
okay!
Mr. HWANG, the competition is now 70 to 1.
the banks are panicking. They running out of applications.
good, keep checking!
Yeah.
congratulations, boss. It's a huge success.
you did a lot of work.
prepare a big feast for the employees tonight.
let's go in.
Hey, Myung-goo! What is a family?
it's a mouth that eats from the same table.
that's right. Our family will go all the way!
I can't trust you.
I can't! I can't!
you must grow up. - You must!
you must!
it's no use explaining, but, your heart is good.
today it's chrysanthemum.
tomorrow it's rose.
you'll fall asleep tired from flirting!
everybody!
I'm tired of waiting, Digger!
I'm tired of waiting, Digger!
I'm so lonely tonight.
lonely, so lonely.
you're a digger, I can't help it
you're a digger, I have to cry.
I'm so lonely tonight.
lonely, so lonely.
I enjoyed your movie.
I was so realistic.
so, why did you call me?
is something troubling you?
your little help will be courage poor people.
let's help poor people. Let's give them love the end of the year.
your little help will be courage poor people.
Hey!

not here, come with me.
I'm busy right now. How about after work?
I can't wait that long.

Freeze!

Jong-gyu, step outside for a while.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry boss.
so what is your plan?
you're gonna hide forever?
I'll clean up the mess since I caused it.
I'll take Min-ho.
what?
I'll finish him and I'll leave the country too.
he's big now. Things can get more complicated.
I can do it, boss.
just make sure you give me my share.
it's all my family can depend on.
just in case, things go wrong, I won't mention your name.
the movie broke the record and sold five million tickets.
thank you again.
now let me introduce director KIM Min-ho.
Hello, I'm KIM Min-ho, the director of the movie.
I'm happy to meet all of you.
thank you for watching our movie.
there were some difficult moments in making this movie, but I never dreamed a day like this would come.
Yeah, Jong-soo. - Boss, I just arrived here.
I'll be right there.
wow, it was crazy going into that theater.
I'm glad we hired those bodyguards.
Thanks, detective!
why do you look so down?
you should cheer up on a day like this.
let's have a drink.
come on, director!
let's drink! - I don't want to ruin this, but I should leave now.
you can't leave! - No you can't, director!
what are you talking about? We're going clubbing after this.
come on!
I feel ashamed...
leting you guys down...
I should've listened to you.
that was my biggest mistake.
what good is it to regret the past, boss?
we just need to try solving it.
after this, while I'm gone, you guys live quietly for two years.
and be a good boss to the boys while I'm gone.
okay, boss.

Oh no, I'm fine.
I met him when I went to the station.

Yes, hello? - Director, where are you?

Bye.

Yes, sir.

I haven't decided yet.
how about my past love story?
excuse me?

Oh, I see...
let's meet often to talk about it.
if you like the story, you don't need to worry about the money.
since you're good at making up stories, I think you'll do it well.
Oh, no... no. Really...

Yup, a fiction will always be a fiction.

thank you, boss.
and congratulations for winning the award.
Yes.
lets forget the past and start fresh. Cheers!
this is one of my favorite songs. The lyrics are good.
Hey, Min-ho.
make something with a real Gangster spirit.
see you.
what's your bIood type?
and your star sign?'
women these days aIways ask that.
isn't that just pathetic?
how can aII the women in the country beIieve in the nonsense that personaIity's related to blood type?
even when drinking wine, they drink according to their blood type.
on pubIic transits, when you hear girls talKing with that nasal voice,
doesn't it reaIIy get to you?
I mean, they are not kids so I don't understand why adults talk like that.
the internet ruined everything!
why, you ask? 'Cause they don't read.
they don't buy a newspaper but read celebrity scandals on the web.
same old pictures. The same old photos.
and what eIse?
talking nonsense as usual about love, about life.
they just sloppily leave a one-liner copied from some lame quotations.
Hahaha. Totally touching. 'Ditto.'
Yeah, right.
now, do I have to become immature and do all that?
I'd rather stay single. Don't you think so, doctor?
am I the weird one?
my Scary Girl
park Yong woo
Chol Kang hee
Cho Eun ji
it's all right. You don't have to help.
don't worry about me.
why don't you put it down for a while?
I can't. I can't lift it back up if I do.
I see...
it's just that I've got a bad back.
no worries.
my back's not any better. - I see...
I'm aII right. I am. Don't you worry. Just go on up.
I won't fall down, I won't fall down, I won't fall down, I won't fall down.
I told you I was fine with it.
I...
who are you?
I live upstairs.
I... uh... that was...
excuse me, sir! Sir!
who is it?
I don't know.
he was looking through my stuff when I came out.
what? Me?
well, I...
this is a misunderstanding.
what's wrong with that old man!
the reason that a pretty guy is addictive.
I'll afford Bangkok, Bali, wherever. Bring all of your friends.
then, we pay nothing, right?
of course! Instead, we go together.
no way!
business is really bad, you know.
but how come you're so happy? - What?
what's your secret? - What secret?
you're always laughing and chatting with girls.
and patting them... So what's the secret?
nothing much.
women just talk to me. Then, I talk back.
and then, they ask questions. And I answer them back.
it's just like that.
so, what is it that you talk about?
Why? You want to date now?
huh, me? - Hey!
what brings you here, Dae-woo?
umm, because...
wasn't your pubIishing company in Yeoksam area?
Oh, we moved here 2 weeks ago.
it's the office right opposite this one.
Really? Why didn't I know that? - I told you before.
you did? - Yeah, you asked me.
do I have to cherish and remember everything that you say?
so, how's your back?
I heard that it's totally busted.
want me to introduce you to a proper acupuncturist?
who said such crap. My back's all fine now.
gotta go. I'm busy.
and my back's all fine, you asshole.
Oh, my legs.
Oh, my back.
why do my back and leg hurt so much?
the pain's killing me.
I have a bit of a bad back, really.
it'd be a load off if only my back was hurting.
my whole body's in pain! How it's killing me.
my legs
what a nice young man.
you know, the other day... - I heard from the delivery man.
I see... - Why didn't you explain back then?
I didn't think he'd just leave like that.
he lives in our building.
what kind of work do you do?
you see, I live with her.
since we'll be seeing each other why don't we say hello?
so, what do you do?
I lecture at a university.
lecture what? - English Literature.
that's nice.
what is it... you want to say?
how about going to the coffee shop? - Just say it here.
what is it?
baby, what you doing outside?
Dae-woo!
Hey! Dae-woo!
Hey! Hwang Dae-woo! Hwang Dae-woo!
Hey, you! Hwang Dae-woo!
open the door! Hey! Dae-woo!
although I'm over 30 years old, I was never romantically involved.
I've never been to the cinema with a girl.
nor have I ever kissed.
still, I've been able to get by until now.
I thought it better to stay single than to be with someone I don't fancy.
seeing my friends dating seemed so immature to me. But!
for a couple of months now, I feel strange.
it's only a little back pain and I don't why, but...
I feel it'd get better if somebody could just softly rub it a bit.
now I reaiiy want to date but I have absolutely no clue as to how.
even if I like someone, I haven't got a clue what to say.
I don't know...
I can't even speak because I'll get embarrassed.
please help me, doctor.
how can it be all depression!
depression for the housewife! Depression for the prep school student!
and depression for not being in love!
Dae-woo, hey, Hwang Dae-woo!
did you listen to me or what?
all right, all right. Back off.
whoever she is, if she's the one then you can just say that one line.
what did I tell you before? - I said back off!
come on. Try saying it now.
would you like to go to the movies with me tomorrow?
do you want to go with another guy? Try saying it out louder!
would you like to go see a movie with me tomorrow?
Yeah! Have some confidence! Be confident!
there aren't many girls who'd refuse you.
wouldn't you like to go see a movie with me tomorrow?
where you going at this hour? - To Daejeon. To get my stuff.
when will you come back? - In a couple of days.
so much dust... - Hello?
HeIIo.
you asked to go to the movies? - What?
I'd like to. - Ah, yes, good bye.
what's your number? - What?
Ah! My number. My number? 016.
Ah! I see.
and your name is? - Wang the man... no...
hwang Dae-woo, Hwang Dae-woo
wang the man is a nickname. Anyone can tell, right?
um... yes, hello?
I'll have to call you back 'cause I'm busy right now...
Oh! To give me your number!
Bravo! Oh, my.
and your name is? - Lee Mina.
let's get in touch tomorrow. We'll decide on the movie, then.
try to get into the casual mode of speech.
by calling her Miss Lee and asking 'would you' or 'could you'...
how can you get past the first base? - How can I when it's not been that long?
you have to make the transition natural so she can feel comfortable about it.
but still, that's a bit... - And yeah!
in the beginning, you have to make them laugh.
in surveys, guys with a sense of humor are always the first place.
but why does the man always have to be funny?
why can't the woman be funny?
listen carefully.
what's he like? 'Oh, he's really funny' And...
what's she like?' 'Oh, she's a laugh' So?
isn't it a bit better that the guy's the funny one?
so you're going to the language institute for your studies overseas, right?
what will you study in Italy?
design.
it's not easy to be starting something new at this age.
but since I have been drawing all my Iife.
I don't think it'd be so hard.
Oh, art school. You went to.
I thought you were in the arts 'cause I saw the picture books.
you really had many books.
no matter how busy I am I try to make time for some reading.
I don't think there's any future in people who don't read.
Yes, of course.
I always thought the same, too.
I'm a bit funny, huh? - Yes, you are.
you read many books haven't you?
are there any books that you'd like to recommend to me?
excuse me?
what meaning did the 20th century have for you?
what?
there was a re-run of BBC's 'What is 20th Century to Humanity?'
while watching it, I asked myself this question.
didn't you listen to what I said? - Sorry?
what... what did you say?
it doesn't matter.
I have to go to the bathroom. - Yes! Yes!
today was great, man. Call ya tomorrow!
what did you say? - What?
why are you talking like that? - I'm sorry.
and today wasn't great, you know.
I'm sorry.
today was great. Great, man.
man.
l hope you'll like it. Hwang Dae-woo.
I need to explain.
I asked you before what meaning the 20th century had for you.
then I expected you to ask me this, while tilting your head to one side 'Well, what does it mean to you?'
then, I planned to answer like this
since I didn't meet you then I'd just trash it down the 'shithole!'
how funny and romantic is that?
isn't that funny?
and when I ran into you at the bathroom, it was all planned.
what I planned to say at that moment was 'Oh! I was temporarily blinded because you're so radiant'.
it's the best! You can't get any funnier!
but you frowned right then, so...
I didn't want to burden you, so...
I purposely put it in your bag without you knowing about it.
I'm not the kind who expects such expensive gifts.
one flower is enough.
you're rater cute.
can't we do it some more?
mina, time out.
actually, Mina,
I can't breathe well through my nose because of empyema.
I just didn't have the time to get the operation done.
good night.
Yes, right.
Hey! What are you doing there?
go on home to sleep.
how can you sleep when the full moon is so bright?
are you the werewolf? Why can't you sleep on a full moon?
sir, am I cute?
what? Looks normal to me.
sir, have you ever kissed?
I kissed today!
you did?
then you'll do it until the end of time.
Oh, dear...
the moon's so bright...
jin Do-hee's best films.
what's this?
tongue... Don't like it? Take it out?
no, don't take it out. Don't! I like it so much.
tongue's the best.
mina?
mina?
mina. I was worried since you didn't answer the phone...
excuse me. I think I'm at the wrong house.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
isn't this the house?
Mina!
I don't want to justify myself.
Yes. He's my ex-boyfriend.
I think you should turn the heater up in the living room.
I mean, I was worried that he might catch a cold being naked like that.
why are you being so childish?
well, I am the most childish person in Asia.
I was childish so I went to childcare center and I almost got arrested for being too childish.
favorite poet, Chaucer. Favorite playwright, Chekhov.
favorite flower, cherry blossoms. And many more besides that.
I broke up with him a year ago.
but I don't know how he found me here.
I'II take care of it.
so please could you be understanding?
you must be thrilled. - About what?
well, this huge thing... huh?
my, My, My
I thought it was a bowling pin.
what?
what do you have against the bowling pins?
you go first. I need to rest.
instead, I know this great place so let's have a drink.
I have to get back to school.
you said there wasn't any afternoon lectures.
there's a seminar next week and I have a presentation to do.
I think I'll have to work on it for couple of days in school.
are you talking about that one at some hotel by the East Coast?
guess you'll have plenty of sashimi.
blah blah blah blah blah blah...
I'll wait until you sort things out with him.
I'm not that uptight.
but I like you.
because I like you so much that...
why do you like me?
I like you because...
you're pretty, elegant, intelligent, and kind.
he left.
don't worry about it now. - Mina.
fuck. The internet made this country into a porn republic.
doing it on the streets like that.
Hey, mister! Mister!
you dig doing it on the street? Do you?
Yes! It's great!
shame on you guys tagging along each other.
just go and get yourself a girl, quick! Morons!
are you crazy?
Oh, yeah?
stop the porn, and let's shoot some action!
come and get me. - Get him! Go!
I Iove you! I Iove you!
elegant and intelligent...
it's a bit difficult to hire someone right now.
can't you send anyone quickly?
don't you know that every day the news is filled with reports about some body found in the mountains or in reservoirs?
that's because it was buried by an amateur.
why did you have to kill him when you could've just held out.
I didn't kill because I wanted to!
I almost got killed.
who is this Hong-Kyu and how did he know about that place?
is he the one you ran away from before? - Yes, he is.
I think it was Jang-mee who called him.
why would Jang-mee do that?
she's not blabbering about the money, is she?
I'll take care of her.
by the way, how do you take the blood out of the wallpaper?
just get it all done again.
I can't do it alone. And I can't hire anyone.
wait.
what would the intellectuals on Naver say?
how do you take blood out of the wallpaper?'
she's like an angel with so much understanding.
I didn't believe in fate before but,
I think I didn't meet anyone else because I was meant to meet her.
Yeah, well, that's...
do you stick your tongue into the mouth when you kiss, too?
Really? Yeah, I did. A while ago.
well, this is the last one. Jang-mee really has lots of clothes.
why did you offer to pay for the taxi?
well, I didn't know she'd ride it all the way from Daejeon.
on top of that, a deluxe taxi.
I'm sorry but let's have a raincheck on your cooking for me.
no, don't. Let's go out and eat together with Jang-mee.
she might be a bit tired. - Let's go out.
please let me make a good impression on your friend.
is the meat not good?
she sure seems comfortable cutting it. - Sorry?
Oh, nothing. I'm not that hungry.
Hey, Mina. You really have a good appetite, don't you?
stabbing yesterday, slicing it today.
is it that good?
wow, you really drink well.
wouId I order another glass? - No, that's all right.
you should stop drinking.
the bathroom...
please excuse me, Jang-mee.
such cheesy drama manners!
why should I excuse him when he's going for a piss.
so you can really communicate with this university lecturer?
well, it's not such a big deal that he's teaching at the university.
why don't you stop drinking and read some books like me
and talk in a cultured way.
Yeah, you sure killed him in a very cultured way.
now that you mention it.
what made you contact him?
you should've been with him and not that academic type.
your lovable meat-chewing lips were making me crazy for a kiss.
later.
I wiII.
Yes.
this is just crazy. You're forgetting who you are.
Yes, honey.
why the hell am I your husband, you crazy bitch!
are you seeing that Kye-dong again?
are you crazy to call him like that? He's not even your friend.
Hey! When will you get rid of that? I got no place to hang my clothes.
I'm looking for someone to take care of it, so wait.
get it out, now!
I hate seeing that bastard's face every morning.
I'll just cover it up later. - And the smell?
if you really hate it, then switch rooms.
why should I switch? Just move it into the bathroom, then.
it's too small in there. - Well, then, do something!
how can I move such a heavy thing in downtown Seoul?
just get a car and go bury him in the mountains.
you know I don't have a license.
if you don't have the license then why did you kill? Why?
just get it out of my room today!
of course.
what Kimchi fridge wouldn't store meat?
if you store at the optimum temperature of -3 degrees.
then it won't freeze up for 15 days.
it doesn't matter if it does...
do you have any that's not divided? I want to store it in one piece.
how many liters are you thinking?
about 72, 73 kilos?
now, this is a past model that came out for both home and business.
it's uniquely made in one piece. This will be enough for you.
it looks a bit small. - No, it doesn't.
it's not small at all. - It looks a bit small.
I'm 70 Kilos. Would you believe me only after I go in there myself?
Yes. - Excuse me?
please get inside it for me.
Oh, I like it.
did I call you too late? - No.
did you take good care of what you had to do in the evening?
Yes, I was really busy today.
Ah, you were busy. I see.
Mina!
you know when I first asked you out.
do you remember the friend that I was with in the elevator?
I do. - He really wants to meet with you.
so tomorrow, him and his girlfriend, the four of us,
we agreed to meet. Is that okay with you?
since tomorrow's a holiday, you don't have any classes, do you?
I have to go to Dae-jeon tomorrow. I'll be coming back late in the afternoon.
then we can meet for dinner.
all right. - All right. Okay.
we can meet for dinner. Okay. Hooray.
tell me.
well, you know that friend I just told you about?
he's running a small travel agency.
he says business is bad these days
so he calls me day and night and begs me to go on a package tour.
well, he says Singapore is really nice
and it'll be fully booked soon. But why will it, if business is bad?
I really don't understand. - So?
well, it's hard to just pass by but it's still difficult to just decide...
would you like to go with me?
well, we can book separate rooms.
it can be arranged like that.
well, I wonder if he'll ask me again tomorrow about it...
why book separate rooms? It's not like we're strangers.
mina...
give me your tongue.
will you get out so that I can get changed?
no, I don't want to.
he seemed liked a genuine guy so why don't you stop right there.
you're not serious about him, are you?
you're a murderer. A murderer.
what's love to you when you've killed someone?
isn't it true? I mean, if you had some common sense.
how would this love affair make sense?
in a while, you have to escape out of the country.
are you going to take him with you?
are you?
Nah, you guys don't match.
maybe with me...
now that I mention it, should I try and seduce him?
wait a bit longer for the corpse to get taken care of.
the professional guy in this field just can't be reached these days.
you'll be staying for dinner, right?
I have to go back because I have a dinner appointment.
what appointment? Who do you know in Seoul?
just some friends from the language institute...
you shouldn't be mingling with other people.
you should stay quiet until you go.
well, I guess you'd know what's best for you.
would you like a drink?
guys are all the same.
how?
you just looked. - I didn't look.
Yeah, you did.
I didn't know it was there.
Yeah, all right. You didn't see anything.
Hey, what are you doing?
just stay still. I want to watch the TV.
please wait a minute.
Hey! Why did you change your pants?
please go, Jang-mee. - Man, He's a real dimwit!
there's only Mina for me so please leave now.
how could a friend do this kind of thing?
compared to me, what's so great about that bitch?
that bitch?
that bitch...
I don't understand why Mina hangs around people like you.
get out. Out! Now!
how strong you are for a girl! Out!
Hey! You!
you'll flip if you knew what she is really like.
art major, studying in Italy, they're all lies!
shut up, you alcoholic!
shit.
why'd you do that, huh?
why'd you brush me off on the web?
I was really happy when you said hello to me on the web.
but Sae-jung told me to never say it back to you, so...
you think Sae-jung's scary and you think I'm not?
and you think it's just about getting brushed off on the web?
I just think you're essentially without any manners.
you get what I'm saying?
later on, I saw that you quit the membership.
so I felt bad because I thought it was because of me.
I was going to, anyway. You shithead.
the phone...
Hey, Paek Jang-mee. Didn't I tell you not to call me?
what are you rambling on about, you little shit!
I mean, did I ever ask for anything else?
what?
what are you saying?
Yeah. What?
Hey, I'm not getting the whole picture.
where you at? Yeah, all right.
I get it. Yeah, I'm on my way.
Yeah, I'm here, now.
which apartment? Yeah, okay.
Yes, I wanted to pick you up at the terminal.
please wait inside a coffee shop or something. I'll be right there.
Oh, I know who that is.
the building with the chicken soup place on the first floor.
that grandpa who came and went. - Yeah, that's the one.
the 2 villas behind that are his and he even had some property.
but, hey...
what kind of a relationship did she have with him that she's inheriting them?
remember me? - Yes, of course.
I was drunk then so I didn't realize what a beautiful woman you are.
Oh, and Jung-hwa works at a publishing company.
Jung-hwa, Mina really loves to read so, please give her your company's books.
what books are you publishing these days?
we're always doing the Russian literature series.
do you like Russian novels?
why doesn't this come undone?
wait a minute. - You scared me.
so, she hit the jackpot in 6 months. How much is she getting?
3 billion or 300 million...
what's the right amount? It's 3 billion, right?
I'm really bad with numbers.
but 3 billion is probably right.
she wouldn't have killed for just 300 million. - She killed?
you said it was a heart attack? - Fuck.
crime and Punishment...
don't you know Dostoyevsky?
I guess she didn't read many because of her art major.
Yeah, she must've been busy drawing.
how could she have the time to read, right?
and dosto or toasto, I mean, how many would have read it?
she said she read many books before.
Jung-hwa! Why don't you stop talking about books, now.
even if you work at a publisher, how can you keep talking about them?
by the way, Mina. I wonder if you like them.
like Mondrian and Kandinski.
at a 20th Century Abstract Painting... - Yes, I think I read them before.
so, you read them...
even I should go around and see some paintings but the only paintings I know are only of Van Gogh.
and isn't Van Gogh easy, right?
I aIso like Van Gogh. I think he's so touching.
becoming insane in the name of his own art, no matter what.
van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853.
wow, you really know your major. How do you know all that?
aries aren't born artistic but
van Gogh was a bit unique in that way.
you see, I'm a Pisces.
so that's why I'm so sensitive and I crave for art more than others.
you believe in star signs? - Actually, I don't really.
it's all for fun. - Yes, of course! It's for fun.
it's because my blood type's AB. AB people don't really believe in them.
in fact, star signs aren't that scientific than blood types.
what's scientific about that! That's all bullshit!
bullshit?
it's a theory that started from eugenics that said Caucasians are superior race.
a Japanese student in Germany brought it back.
Germans themselves disposed of it.
but later, one Japanese writer researched about 2, 300 people around him.
and he published a book and we're just scrounging on it.
from all over the world, only Japan and Korea believe in it.
what's going on? - Did I do something wrong?
all irrelevant answers to all the important questions.
talking about things like blood types and star signs.
do you really not know who Dostoyevsky is?
crime and Punishment?
well, if you didn't read it, then at least you would've heard the name.
I think I saw it on MBC broadcast...
the sufferings of Koreans in Soviet Union...
that was the drama Kareiski starring Kim Hee-ae.
why are you remembering that, now?
and if you're an art major then why haven't you heard of Mondrian?
I wasn't very good in my major studies.
the painting in your living room. That is Mondrian! Mondrian!
studying in Italy is a lie, right? - I'm going to Italy!
which design school will you go to? - I haven't decided, yet.
is it true that you really did draw before?
you lied, right?
the picture books at home are just for decoration, right?
where are you going? - Let me go!
if you go alone, what would it make me look like?
let go!
you're blood type A, right? - What?
you're definitely type A! Type A, for sure!
type A always likes to argue and they're so suspicious!
what?
well, who have we here? Did you have dinner?
can't you be a bit happier to see me in a long time?
and as for the ramen, you have to boil the noodles aside and eat it after draining out the oil.
they say Kim Hae-soo eats like this.
and if possible, it's best if you don't eat it at all.
she's all boozed up so come an chat with me.
about what? - About money, of course.
I heard about your jackpot, from an old man with a bad heart and short life.
Yeah, you should live to the full. So how did you kill him, huh?
did you switch the medicine? No, wait...
the pillow? Or you suddenly surprised him?
stop talking nonsense. - Just shut my mouth up...
with the wad.

Mr. Lim!
I heard that your daughter's sword dance is wonderful.
could I see her dance?
that's just a groundless rumor.
I don't think so.
no matter how busy I am,
I'd never make that up.
for the sake of this meeting,
I'd like to see her dance.
what do you think everyone?
directed by JO Jin-kyu
don't move!
my WIFE IS A GANGSTER 3
boss!
is it true that Mr. Lim's daughter killed my husband?
ma'am, We've had trouble with the Hwabaekryun Gang.
there will be a war soon.
you should leave Hong Kong for a while.
you have something up your sleeve, don't you?
don't worry. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
I swear.
I'll take my revenge on them.
Mr. Lim. I heard that your daughter is involved in this incident.
nobody can be sure of it yet.
JWA Guk Choong is the actual leader of the Black Dragons.
he is a man of great ambition.
have a meeting to clear up their misunderstanding.
it's too late when the elders of the Black Dragons lose power.
you're right.
since I also share the blame for my daughter,
I'll meet them to settle things.
things don't look so good.
the Black Dragons believe that your daughter did it.
to take over the Black Dragons, Jwa Guk Choong will use her as a victim.
a storm should be avoided. That's the proper means to take.
but...
find a place for her in America.
if it's only for my safety, there's no need.
it's not that simple.
you know it's not only about you.
leave Hong Kong for a while.
you know what? You're always like this.
you get rid of your problems.
just do what I'm telling you.
fine.
you can send me away, but I'll decide the place.
where do you think she'll go?
boss, I'm here!
someone is coming from Hong Kong tomorrow.
want me to bury him?
you idiot!
don't overreact.
Yes, boss. Then how about breaking his legs?
it's idiots like you who make people hate gangsters like us!
you can speak Chinese, right?
Yes, boss...
I traded with the Chinese three years ago.
what do you mean by 'trade'? It's smuggling.
so what did you smuggle?
lots of things, - like perilla oil, sesame... - I see.
Viagra. - That's enough.
ginger. - Shut up!
since only you can speak Chinese, you take charge.
Yes, boss!
so all I need to do is scare him off in Chinese?
it's not like that.
you're receiving a guest, so be a good host.
come on, boss.
that kind of job isn't right for me.
come on! This puts me down. Plus, I'm not some guide.
come on, boss.
you've gotten real big now.
so you're not going to do it? - No, I will, boss.
flight OZ 333, 15: 00 Name: Lim Aryoung
go ahead and eat.
what did Big Boss tell you?
you don't look so good.
for ten years as a gangster,
I've been humiliated into a guide.
what's a 'guide'?
idiot. Don't you know what 'guide' is?
haven't you ever gone on a trip?
I've been on the run lots of times.
who are you going to guide anyway?
a Chink from Hong Kong.
big Boss wants me to guide him.
maybe the guy who's coming is a big gun.
I heard that Big Boss is planning to extend the business.
I bet that guest is a part of it.
this could be your big chance.
take it.
heroes adore girls.
how about attaching a girl to him?
know of a good one?
I'll find a nice girl who can speak Chinese.
let's eat!
what's taking him so long?
Hey, is this the right gate? - Yes, boss.
idiots!
who are you?
I can't believe this girl.
what's with you?
do you like me or something?
sorry but I'm busy now.
I'm Lim Aryoung.
what?
are you Lim Aryoung?
boss, was the guest a girl?
how old are...
damn it.
what the hell!
they know me as The Meanest Man in Bulgwang district'.
Hey!
Freeze!
how...
how old are you?
shit, she's completely ignoring me.
Hey! Don't you hear my boss?
what a bad-tempered bitch.
boss, she's quite pretty, and looks to be from a good family.
why don't you work on her?
Hey! Don't you know my taste?
boss doesn't like Chinese food.
I eat everything, though.
are you out of your mind? - Stop!
take it easy. She's our guest.
she's driving me crazy. - Hey, calm down.
I have an idea.
boss. Are you ready? - Ready for what?
you son of a bitch! Are you trying to kill me?
bastard.
what a bitch.
good afternoon, sir.
screw you and your afternoon.
who the hell is she?
from Hong Kong. - Hong Kong?
hong Kong girl. - She came here to see Big Boss.
shut up, idiot!
they're talking now, so wait.
take it back. - Please take a look at it once.
it's information for you about the real estate at Yeoju.
I said take it back.
I've grown up under you.
so help me stay polite to you.
he said that they're talking now.
she's so hot-headed. I said wait!
Hey!
I'm sorry, boss.
let's go.
I'm here to see Mr. Yang.
Oh, you've arrived.
I'm in a meeting now, so could you wait for a moment?
you seem to be busy, so I'll leave for now.
please think it over. You have one week.
I hope I'll see you nice and healthy even after a week.
Oh yeah.
they say that Yeoju is a great place to retire.
the air is very clean there.
bastard.
how is Mr. Lim?
fine.
I would've liked to put you into a nice hotel, but your father asked me not to do so.
that's okay.
you will find your place a bit uncomfortable.
if you have any problems, tell him.
he's not so smart, but good enough to order around.
is he abnormal or something?
little bit stupid, but not that abnormal.
you little...
we got a lot of bills again.
it's so damn heavy.
Hey. Come here.
this is your room.
small but comfy, huh?
No! Not this room!
this is humiliating.
does she like her room?
she's such a brat.
she has to suffer to learn.
catfish, did you see her face?
Hey, you! What are you doing?
hey...
are you a pervert or something? I can't believe this!
brat.
catfish. I got this ominous feeling. Doesn't our future look dark?
we need to show her who's the boss.
I'll take care of it, boss.
are you okay? - Son of a bitch!
Hey! - Hey!
stop it! - Calm down, man!
it was just a mistake.
my head almost cracked open, asshole!
what are you doing?
boss!
good morning, boss.
what are you doing? Running a circus or something?
we're scaring that Chinese witch.
think that'll work?
boss, think this will work? In my opinion...
believe the proverbs.
beat on girls and sandbags every three days.
but why do we have to get beaten? - It's just make-believe, idiot.
all we need to do is set the mood to show her what we're made of.
here we go... - Did we get hit?
you bastards! Wham!
get it right! Wham!
wham!
how many times did I tell you?
boss.
you pigs!
don't move, you bastards! Don't move your asses!
boss, what's the matter? - Shut up!
back into position! - Yes, boss!
back in place! Don't move!
please boss.
is that what I taught you?
no, boss. Please forgive us.
back in place. Back in place, you bastards!
have mercy! - You're too relaxed!
did I teach you to be like that?
bastards.
you don't know how to hit yet.
if you hit like this, it makes a big sound but no pain.
it doesn't hurt.
but if you hit another way, it makes great pain.
you're one evil bitch.
does it hurt?
there are techniques and tricks for impact.
boss, she's lost her mind.
this exercise is good for the back muscles.
look!
hello.
I heard you're looking for a translator.
sorry.
I think I've found the wrong house.
no, it's the right one.
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do this.
Hey!
put this in my room.
I'll use it right when the time comes.
Hey. What did you just say?
I'll do this job with all my heart.
translate this to her.
if you're a guest, act like a guest. Translate.
you seem to have gotten hurt earlier. Are you okay now?
it's nothing.
she said it is because Korea is unfamiliar to her.
why did you come to Korea? Translate.
why did you come here?
none of your business.
she came here to eat new food, make new friends, and go around places to gain many new experiences.
her answers are really short, but it's got some meaning.
who do you think we are?
translate automatically.
who do you think we are?
I don't care.
she said you look like businessmen.
close, but we live a bit rougher than that.
you don't have to translate that.
can I help you out of here?
no, I have no place to go.
how about the police?
no need. They're idiots.
what? - Hey!
no girl-talk in my place.
there's nothing that I can't solve.
if you have any problem, tell him.
find the woman in that picture.
she wants you to find a woman.
if you fail, you're dead.
she kindly asks for your help, and will reward you plenty.
see? Catfish? This is why conversation is important.
this job is for you.
Yes, boss.
there must've been some misunderstanding.
here.
be nice to us, and you'll be fine, okay?
he said they'll do their best, so don't worry.
if you want to live, you better find her.
what's that? - She said you're very handsome.
she finally gets it now.
Hey, why aren't you laughing?
what's this? - Pot.
Rice-pot. - Stone-pot.
cook the rice in this pot, - and the side dishes are... - Wait.
I'm only here for the translation.
there are two healthy women in this house.
think it makes sense that I keep cooking?
gender doesn't matter...
Hey! - ...these days.
I thought you were a nice girl, but now I'm changing my mind.
listen. Can you live without money?
think the world will revolve?
look. Can you find any girls on these bills? No?
king Sejong? Of course not.
look, this is the law of the world.
go cook the rice!
mother, I will escape this place alive.
will boss like her food? - Probably better than yours.
I'm so tired! Boss! Food is ready!
something smells delicious.
what's this soup? - Bean-sprout soup!
yeah? It looks good. Let me taste it.
you crazy...
Hey, that's seat for the boss. Get up.
it's okay. Easy, easy.
she's our guest.
she's a guest only when she behaves like a guest.
time to eat.
but why do I have a disposable spoon?
there are no extra spoons left. Please eat.
if something like this happens again, we'll go on a picnic together.
got it?
do you like it?
not bad.
by the way, what's your name?
Yeon-hee. - Yeon-hee.
where from?
Kilrimsung.
aren't you afraid?
please be careful.
Hey!
you seem to be insulting us.
no, not at all. - Your eyes...
what's that on the wall?
she asked what those letters mean.
are you really Chinese? Decipher it.
it's our motto.
it means that a man isn't a man.
it means that a man isn't a man until he is a true man.
until he is a true man.
she's got a bag full of tricks.
come on Mr. Noh. You're putting us in a tight spot.
take it easy and please drink this.
damn it.
what the hell are they doing here?
so are you going to pay up or what?
why are you shouting? You'll give me a heart attack.
want me to do more than talk?
don't you think we should get out of here?
don't Worry. They're nice.
don't you see what they're doing?
look at their eyes. They're fools.
please watch your mouth. It could get me into trouble.
okay.
don't expect us to be nice! - Come on!
Oh! Hi there!
mandarin Fish, long time no see.
what are you doing here? - To collect money.
collect money?
showing off in front of the girls?
how humiliating.
what? Do you want to fight?
Hey, boys.
keep them alive.
collecting the debts is being delayed.
they seem to be avoiding us.
what about the casino? - It's steadily growing.
but Chopper stepped into our collecting area.
it's not for me to say, but this is definitely a mutiny.
mutiny? Think we're on a boat, idiot?
boss, are you going to just sit there?
this is absurd. I could never forgive the...
shut up! Watch your mouth here!
let's drink!
why aren't you eating? Aren't you hungry?
Oh, hello boss!
Hello, boss. - Sit down.
I've been so busy. Sorry I'm late for dinner.
no, not at all. - Huh?
Hey! Translate!
he said he's sorry for being late.
it disgusts me when a man's late.
she likes a busy man.
what's with her?
we've been educating her. - Really?
so she's matured now, huh? Great.
have any problem with these guys?
Hey, translate.
if I could just chew him up, it would make me so happy.
she said none. - Are you sure?
then when you see Big Boss later, tell him just that.
that it's hard to find good men like us.
filth like them lures filth.
you must be really upset.
she said you're all so wonderful.
you're really straightforward.
okay, let's toast to us! - Cheers.
Hey, don't you know how to toast?
bottoms up! - I can't drink at all.
you can neither cook nor drink.
how about this?
what is this?
something very soft...
something very soft?
eating hot fried pork and vomiting is really painful.
are you all right, boss?
boss.
we fought Parrotfish Boss's boys today.
they looked down on us.
don't call him boss.
anyway, something's strange.
think we're with the right side?
Hey, boy. Once you start, you keep going.
look at me.
we're men, and I, Han Ki-chul...
once I start, I go forever!
Oh! Girls! - Parrotfish, what are you doing here?
you assholes, did you hit my boys?
no, I didn't.
hey meatheads. Still don't know what's going on?
get out.
she said to leave.
what a coincidence! It's the Hong Kong girl.
we meet too often. Don't you think so?
did you see that?
she's really fun.
you better leave here now.
if you attack her again, she'll rip you apart.
do you want to die?
you bitch.
damn it.
boss!
what's this smell?
what is it? - Boss, that chic...
I mean Miss Lim Aryoung. - Miss who?
it was maybe ten seconds, I think. Anyway, really fast.
what are you talking about?
she beat up Parrotfish with just one swing.
he must be drunk out of his mind.
no, trust me this time.
she threw these chopsticks and they stuck to their foreheads.
about ten of them fell down at a time.
then Miss Lim jumped into the air.
stop drinking for a while.
I know I like to exaggerate a bit, but...
shut up.
get a grip on yourself.
what's with your face?
I'm sorry.
who was that?
at a pub last night, Ki-chul...
Ki-chul?
Ki-chul's girl from Hong Kong... - So you let a kid beat you?
sorry.
the world works on two things.
one is through the fist, and the other is through the head.
call Big Boss.
Yes, boss!
I told you to lay low.
but What's all this noise? - What?
boss, there must be a misunderstanding.
Yes, sir.
what's wrong, boss?
big Boss said I beat up Parrotfish last night.
remember anything?
nothing happened when I was there.
you beat Parrotfish Boss?
I don't think so. - Me, neither.
it's strange.
are you looking for Aryoung's mother?
mother?
the woman in the picture is her mother?
Yes, I have a feeling she is.
what's the progress?
I found her address, but she moved away and nothing more.
anyway, do we have to do this, boss?
don't you think you're being irresponsible?
are you crazy?
she's right.
a man has to be responsible for what he said.
ask Detective Kim for a favor.
he's an expert at finding people.
I may be out of place, but my mother left home when I was a boy.
is it impossible to find people who left home on their own?
what did you just say?
who else could help her but us?
what the hell's wrong with you?
she's her mother! It's not like she's an aunt!
shut up.
the one who'll find her is Detective Kim, not you.
you're right, boss.
bribe, I mean, give Detective Kim enough commission to find her.
Yes, sir.
if you don't hurry, don't blame me for what happens to you.
be careful!
very careful!
what?
why isn't there any order in this place?
Yeah. I couldn't get this girl out of my mind.
and why Big Boss would put her on Ki-chul.
the stocks of Hong Kong Casino belong to a man named Hwang So-myeong.
isn't she something like a proxy? - Proxy?
she wasn't a normal girl.
how do you know that? - Because I was beaten by her.
beaten by her? - I'm sorry, boss!
a gangster was beaten by a girl?
can you believe that?
I'm sorry, boss.
I can't believe it, either.
no, I didn't mean that.
it's quite fun.
let's go meet them.
flatfish Boss, what are you doing here?
chopper Boss wants to see you. - Why?
because you beat Parrotfish.
there must be a misunderstanding.
I didn't beat Parrotfish Boss.
if you don't come, your men will die.
Hey, you go home with her.
wait. Chopper Boss invited the Hong Kong girl, too.
why her?
she has nothing to do with this.
Yes, she does. Ask her.
he wants to take you away.
it's etiquette to respond to an invitation.
Hey! What's wrong with her? Does she like him?
she's just responding to the invitation.
I can't stand her fucking personality!
I'll wait for you at the house. - What?
Hey! Hey!
I can't talk to her without you.
I'm sorry, boss.
there seems to be a misunderstanding.
please let my boys go.
nobody is holding on to them.
have a drink.
you boys okay?
sorry, boss.
no, I got drunk and raised havoc, so it's my fault.
that's not what happened.
ashamed of being beaten by Aryoung, Parrotfish lied to Chopper Boss.
what?
what did she do to him?
parrotfish couldn't even lay a finger on her.
why didn't you tell me that?
I told you last night, didn't I?
boss, the translator also saw it all.
then why did they beat you two?
we don't know that, either. - Yeah!
Hey! Stop the greetings, and come on over here.
you all are really blind about what's going on.
Ki-chul, I like you.
let Big Boss take a rest in peace.
if you work for me, you can save their lives.
let's be a team.
boss.
you should be careful from now on.
you bastard. - Hey.
who knows that one of them...
...will burn your home down some day?
fire! It's hot!
fire...
what should I do?
I know it's been hard working under a thug with no sense of duty.
I won't fight you one by one.
come at the same time.
no, no. You want to fight me, don't you?
if I don't beat you down until he smokes this up, you win. Satisfied?
don't butt in.
I'm scared. - Shut up!
let's get out of here.
hurry. - Let go of me.
going out for the Olympics?
what are you waiting for?
do what you want, but don't touch her.
if you touch her, you're dead.
this is your last warning.
don't touch her.
I won't tell you this again.
don't make me mad!
sons of bitchs.
back off. Hide yourself behind me.
don't worry about me.
this is the end of the war.
if you get on my nerves again, I'll kill you.
don't touch them.
if you bother them once more, you, your family, cousins, pets, will be ripped into pieces.
let's go.
even if they're hit by a car or struck by lightening, it's still your fault.
welcome!
what would you like?
boss, how about some noodles?
noodles, please. - Coming right up.
you have a strong punch, boss.
if the opponents exceed you in number, beat the leader and it's all over. You saw what happened, right?
anyway, if it wasn't for you, Aryoung would've been in danger.
Yeah.
whatever, you chicken shits.
Ki-chul!
Yes!
let me know if anyone bothers you.
don't get your asses kicked around, you chicken shits.
do you want anything else, boss?
Hey, this isn't right. - Hey!
shit!
well...
you see... - Actually...
actually...
what?
what?
never mind, you can't speak Korean.
he can't speak Chinese anyway.
did you find about the woman I asked about?
what? I didn't look at anything.
you didn't?
you've got something to hide, don't you?
please trust me. I'm not that kind of man.
you promised me. Don't you remember?
what?
are you cursing me out in sign language?
Oh brother.
I swear I saw nothing.
promise me that you'll find her.
I swear by the moon.
you don't have to go that far.
you smiled.
see? You look prettier when you smile.
Cheers! - Cheers!
well...
what?
your lips.
what do you mean?
what's that?
wipe your lips like this.
now?
Yes, lick it up.
this is unbelievable.
wait, I'm not ready yet...
it's gone. Good night.
is she implying we kiss inside?
it hurts bad.
does it hurt?
how old is she?
I heard she's twenty.
I heard she's ineriting everything.
of course, she's the only family that's left.
I heard she's looking for her brother.
then her brother gets the ineritance, too?
there are things that I see which can't be seen,
the people around me,
their eyes on me are cold,
colder than the snow,
the whole world is cold like this,
where am I?
what hope do I have to live on?
I don't need anything,
love ME NOT

Hello, Julian.
give me a cigarette. - Yeah.
How've you been?
been great.
Where's Ryu Jin?
he's in the car.
Where's my car?
well, it got smashed.
it got into an accident.
I swear I didn't do it. It was Jin.
well, it's been a few days.
at that intersection by the club. Jin took the car out.
he dodged an approaching car.
but that crazy bastard crossed the median.
so he tried to avoid it, but wham.
Oh that? That's Ryu Jin.
I told you he was in the car.
people get small like that after they die.
Julian?
Yes, it's me.
how come I can't reach you? - I was out of the country.
Really? - Yeah.
how have you been? - Fine, and you?
I'm fine as always.
you missed me, didn't you? - Of course.
what are you doing today?
I'm sorry. I didn't know you'd go to jail.
forget it.
he said he was going to take care of everything.
I didn't do it.
well, all women are the same.
I'll make the IOU for six months.
thanks for this.
don't do this.
Julian.
don't go. You know how much I love you.
I don't need love.
is this Ryu Jirs cell phone?
it's mine now.
let's go to the club.
I got lots of money!
Julian!
Julian! - Julian!
Where've you been?
so handsome.
Julian, look at me.
I love you everyone. Cheers!
Cheers! - Cheers!
Julian, Julian.
my club's number one host, Julian.
you've been through a lot.
but you know what?
I found out about it all while you were in prison.
so you wanted to go independent after swindling money from rich girls?
you know that bad rumors get around in this town.
shut up!
don't try to play games with me.
look at me straight in the eyes.
even your wonderful piece down there is through now.
what a cool breeze.
but I smell a womars groin in the wind.
shit, this isn't right.
people have misunderstood one thing about me.
a guy like me can never fall.
you got that right!
the king of Adonis Club will never fall.
so how about we go independent now as you planned.
your fan club will be waiting in line all across the country.
I'll do my best to help.
shit!
you bastard.
you crazy bastard!
get out of the truck! You're a real wisecrack.
get out right now.
long time no see. - You're a really funny guy, with that big car of yours.
Hey! You!
you two know each other?
damn it!
what the hell is this?
huh?
do you know how to drive?
this is crazy.
you look really beat.
Yes, I sure am.
I have a problem.
I know.
I heard you went straight to the club.
that's why I came to you right away.
you know? Really?
please help me out.
let's see.
total, 2. 87 million dollars.
Plus, the 6-month interest on the loan.
sorry.
one month.
this clock is ticking on your behalf.
the world is unpredictable.
fun, isn't it?
Hey! Wait.
wait.
2. 87 million dollars in one month?
come on.
that's crazy!
then, shall we make it three days?
when you were a big shot, you were the one who demanded 500, 000 dollars in three days.
so you should know the rules.
you should've lived with modesty.
and don't forget the one who made you what you are.
it's Julian.
call me at this number.
shit.
why'd you bring that bastard here?
Ji-hyae!
you've got no manners. - Why the fuck are you cursing?
go away!
Yes, it's Julian. - Where do you think you are?
no way, so what happened?
so there was no other choice.
in that tiny basement,
I spent that winter with my insane alcoholic father.
what a rotten mother.
how could she have abandoned you?
don't know.
he looked at me...
with a very sad face one day.
and then he caressed his hand on my face.
I really hated it.
his hand was damp and smelled strange.
and the moment he lit the cigarette in his mouth, he burned.
in flames.
he burned in front of my eyes.
half of his body was burned to a crisp.
that's nonsense.
it's a lie again, right?
of course it's a lie.
come on.
it was true?
come here,
I'll hug you.
no, I have a meeting at three.
here you are.
you're such a lovely woman.
six months for the IOU?
I told you, it's my present.
money, money.
what? Only one grand?
what bad manners.
it's enough for just a pair of shoes.
dom Perignon Vintage, please. - Yes.
who keeps calling a hundred times a day?
one of Ryu Jirs clients, I bet. Listen to the message.
there's probably no password.
you know the saying, your girl is my girl, and my girl is yours.
or... regulars follow wherever the famous chef goes.
how much?
my name is Park Ki-young, Your father's lawyer,
what does it say? You can tell if they're rich...
I'm calling you to talk about your ineritance,
your father has passed away,
I feel really bad for the guy.
he said he went through a lot when he left home after his parents divorced.
his parents are all dead and now their son.
only thing left is the money.
whether you're rich or a host, you're all the same when you die.
don't you agree?
Oh yeah, he said once that he's got a younger sister.
then she'll get all that money.
this is his younger sister?
Yeah, she's twenty.
he wrote letters to her everyday.
everyday?
Yes, everyday.
crazy bastard.
play this. - Okay.
let's go at least.
we'll hand over the ashes, and offer our grievances.
tell them how sorry we are and shed some tears.
that way we'll get compensated with some money.
he's rich.
Jin, what do you want? - Rice,
anything,
nothing hard about it.
we're the only ones who can give this to Jirs family.
let's go.
what if you can't pay him back in a month?
he'll kill me.
what? Then he won't get his money.
I don't want to die, that's why I pay him back.
damn it, it's raining.
it's pouring.
what a house. - Hop out.
look at that house.
it's a huge mansion.
what is your name?
Micky. Cute and fun Micky.
not that, your real name.
kim Tae-ho?
Yes, Tae-ho.
from now on, forget about Julian and Micky.
you're Kim Tae-ho, Ryu Jirs secretary.
what?
there's also a woman in that house.
hold on.
who is it? - Ryu Jin.
you're going to impersonate him?
you're no Ryu Jin.
I'm not going. I'm scared.
you'll go to jail again if you get caught.
trying to take me to jail with you?
I'm scared.
thank you for coming.
I'm Park Ki-yong, the one who called you.
she's been taking care of this house for 15 years.
this is Ms. Lee.
and Mr. Oh here has been running your father's company after his death.
pleased to meet you.
this is my secretary, Kim Tae-ho.
and my sister?
Mr. Park. - I know it's a formality, but we need to make sure about your background, so...
so?
check my identification?
mother loved the clock on that wall.
but it's not here anymore.
it used to hang there.
that...
mother picked a picture herself, and hung it here.
it's all been changed.
was it that bastard again?
I didn't come here for this.
so is that why the apple tree in the yard was thrown away?
there was such a thing?
the apple tree that Mother raised!
we came to this house after you and your mother had left...
it was there!
mother and I raised that tree ourselves!
Where's Min?
huh?
min.
min!
who are you to yell in here?
min, it's me, your brother.
don't let any strangers into my house.
min, it's raining outside!
my sister can't see?
actually, I was going to tell you.
min, wait!
min, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
min!
it's been so long. My only image of you as a kid...
Jin!
min!
I'm sorry, Min.
from now on, I will...
go back!
you and mom died 16 years ago.
I've never once forgotten about you.
you know that. It was all in the letters.
letters?
there were letters?
no, we didn't receive any letters.
Mr. Park.
compensate him and send him away.
in your father's will, your brother is also entitled to the ineritance.
you must sign first for the ineritance - to be settled. - I told you he's dead!
why do I need to sign for a dead person?
okay, you take care of it.
because I don't need that money.
then get out of here right now.
min!
we're the only two left.
I can't leave you alone and go.
if you smile...
if you smile like you once did, then I'll leave.
until then,
I want to be with you.
now are you satisfied?
leave.
min, my love for you...
I don't need love.
cerebral thrombosis?
she fell sick when she was 13, and totally lost her sight at 15.
what did that father of ours do at the time?
he did the best he could for Min.
he took her to all the famous hospitals.
he even took her overseas many times.
although she was in a critical state, she survived thanks to him.
you'll find it comfortable for your stay here.
I'll clean up the room on the third floor.
you can move your belongings in there.
don't worry about me.
I have to go overseas soon for an important business.
this is the room.
Bye. - Thank you.
have a good rest. - Yeah.
I was scared out of my wits.
we would've been dead if it wasrt for this ball.
that girl's got a serious temper. She takes after her brother.
is your face alright?
go pack my stuff and bring them here.
there's a fine for every inch ripped even on a pool table.
so imagine scratching Juliars face. It's a crime.
so my life is in her hands.
he's different from what I had imagined.
as you know, people are influenced by the environment they're raised in.
I'm telling you, it was unreal.
I could feel his mastery.
that teary-eyed acting of his.
I should've recorded that stuff and study it.
but I didn't bring the camera.
Hey!
do it right.
you missed the nail.
I'm sorry.
you can't get anything right.
you know exactly what an ineritance is?
study that instead. Think you'll get the job done?
you two are hopeless anyway.
a Ferrari.
nice.
delicious.
thank you for the meal.
there's still some left.
it's bad manners not to finish.
min usually doesn't eat much.
then put your dishes away.
usually, I... - Ms. Lee, I wasrt talking to you.
min!
it's etiquette to take your dishes at least.
saw that?
a blind person can't do this.
Ryu Min!
please stop.
there are many people who can do this even though they can't see.
min!
I'll help you. Let's go downstairs.
I get scared if you suddenly grab me!
you do? Sorry, I didn't know.
but...
but Ms. Lee can't always be by your side.
so let's put in an effort together so that you can do things yourself.
is that what you wanted to say?
don't worry about trivial stuff like that.
money can handle everything.
I feel the same way.
min.
can you hear me?
the most important thing in the world is that can't be bought with money.
don't weigh money and your heart on the same scale.
understand?
min gets scared when many people are around.
she particularly dislikes outsiders coming here.
if something happens, how will you...
who did this?
I did not permit this!
min, shall we play, too?
ms. Lee.
Yes, I'm here, Min.
send everyone out.
send them out this instant!
you're being too mean to the kids.
who cares? If I don't like it, that's it.
yeah?
then you leave.
don't lock yourself in, just because you can't see.
min...
don't interfere. This is a family matter.
be careful on your way out.
ms. Lee, what's the best way to grab on to a blind person?
here, grab on to this.
I thought you've never been outside alone.
I'll help you.
careful, careful.
even the smell of the grass is nice.
all I smell is cigarette smoke.
fine.
I know that you had a hard life.
but I'm here now.
there's only the two of us.
us two have to live together.
so can't you open your heart a bit?
Oh yeah, you said money is all you need?
sure you do.
but you think the world will be easy on a blind girl?
never. It doesn't work that way.
min.
I'll take care of everything from now on.
just trust me and follow me.
let's make a new start.
I know how you feel.
I'll never leave you.
you know how I feel? - Let me finish!
how do you know how I feel?
know how it feels to gradually lose your sight?
min! - Let go!
know how it feels to lose the memories you want to cherish?
it would've been better if I was just born blind.
I want you to remember exactly how cruel you've been to me.
I was doing well forgetting.
but now, you're making me remember everything.
will the stone turn into a lump of gold?
I think you've picked up the wrong stone.
Jin.
kill me.
Tae-ho,
I got a favor to ask.
are you sure?
don't ask.
I ordered it from a trustwon'thy website.
but aren't you going overboard?
who'd give a deadly pill to someone as a gift?
but it does seem possible.
people, you see, don't die so easily.
so what does this cane have to do with it?
a present for my sister,
a mascot of fortune?
what?
a gift?
min, what are you going to do today?
there are things that you see which can't be seen.
want to go with me?
anyway, what's in this?
Oh, that?
drugs.
drugs?
drugs that will make you die.
I thought you wanted to die.
don't be scared.
it was a joke.
if you say you're going to die again, you'll get a beating, okay?
it'll relieve all your stress!
come this way!
grab the trigger and hold the gun like this.
and then shoot.
I'll aim for you and you just shoot, okay?
I can't.
Yes, you can.
shoot again.
it was close.
what a great couple!
let me take your picture.
I'll capture a wonderful memory.
min, wait here. I'll be right back.
what are you doing? You were doing great.
she'll hate you again.
sadness follows happiness.
when it comes, it's very painful.
right?
you feel like dying.
min!
sorry, I got caught up on my way.
it's okay.
since you promised to protect me anyway.
in your awkward Braille letter.
show me something fun again.
a witch appeared.
the witch tries to kill the princess, but the prince appears.
that sound's from somewhere else.
I know. Just get the explanation right.
but that witch is really ugly.
very ugly.
and her cheeks are loose.
stay still, let me see your face.
it's different from the face I had imagined.
Yes, her temperature has gone down.
doctor, I did as you told me.
Yes.
I understand.
good-bye.
will she be alright?
it's nothing serious, but she'll need to go to the hospital tomorrow.
then I'll send the car to her first thing in the morning.
Mr. Oh, you seem to look after Min very much.
I'm sorry, I haven't told you yet.
they'll get married soon.
why haven't you told me before? I almost mistook them.
it's getting late. You should get going.
I'll take her to the hospital tomorrow.
hello.
so is this Ryu Jin?
nice to meet you. I should've greeted you sooner.
sorry we had to meet the first time like this.
what are you talking about?
pardon?
I'm sorry.
I don't remember at all.
do I know him?
of course.
but why can't I remember?
since when have you known our family?
I must've aged a lot.
think back carefully.
my family also knows you very well.
no, I'm sure I don't remember.
stop it, Jin.
don't be mean to the Doctor.
forget it. It's okay.
he could've forgotten. It's been a long time.
whether it's 10 or 100 years, I remember everything.
Mr. Ryu Jin.
now, let's go up.
where are your manners?
I guess we take after each other.
call me. I'll be outside.
no, please go on with your business.
we have some other things to tend to.
okay.
pretty, huh?
but she has no brains.
what happened?
I thought you two were going to the hospital.
I don't like that family.
Why? Something wrong?
they disgust me.
why are they having a fit over her getting a cold?
she's no paper doll.
they're better than a fake brother.
Yeah.
better than a fake.
Mr. Mustache is here again.
I told you she's the wrong stone.
tell me the truth.
you like being her brother, don't you?
min, try on this wedding dress.
it's in a V-neck.
there's a ribbon here. It's a high waist style.
this is a silver ring.
there's a small diamond inside.
you picked the clothes yourself for the first time.
I just wanted to wear them.
a rich girl can't help being tacky, either.
I should've followed my dad to the driving range instead.
think the driving range will help you improve your swing?
once this job is a done deal,
I'll take you to Saipan.
you need to play golf there to get better.
you're taking me, right?
stop the bullshit.
just pay my money back.
Where's that lady going?
to the bathroom?
who'd go to the bathroom with her bags?
min!
righteous TIES
the rain to the wind said, "You push and I'll pelt."
robert Frost
take the stab. I'm in a hurry.
so... You're doing me?
no kid wants to do this shit these days.
some go to the army...
some take refuge and don't come out.
seven stabs on the thigh?
so, that's not enough?
stab only half way just under the stomach.
I won't dig up like the kids do.
you meddle with the wrong parts...
I die.
do it nice and easy.
shit, this ain't no surgery!
you want an anesthesia or what?
what the hell are you doing?
just let me send a text message.
shit, man.
do I have to wait for you?
noisy town, huh?
shit face. You came to stab me?
do you hear that?
that's the cops coming to protect me.
what guys doing? Stand up.
drop to your knees and beg, assholes.
before you get kicked in jail for life!
that's a sudden change of attitude.
I'll kill you, you stupid idiot.
it's a fire truck, sir.
there's a fire across the street.
should've sent the text message when you could have, asshole!
Jung Jae-young
Jung Joon-ho
Ryu Sueng-yong and MIN Jee-han
four previous convictions, and now attempted murder.
how long should I put you in for?
please show some mercy.
first time being interrogated by a prosecutor?
Yeah.
mercy is no word to use in front of a prosecutor.
just try to make a deal.
Dong Chi-sung. Right-hand man of KIM Young-hee. Right?
Yeah.
you guys follow orders.
and you even disobey orders and do someone because you're the right-hand man.
so you say you've done it on your own.
then I'll get you life imprisonment.
then the judge'll give you 20 years.
you go through all sorts of appeals, and you'll still get 15 years, as simple as that.
you want to stay 15 years in jail?
now, let's consider this. Say KIM Young-hee gave the orders.
say you're indebted to him, and you just did what he told you to do.
you're his right-hand man, dammit.
4 years ago I tried to bring in KIM Young-hee.
he asked me whether I knew how to fit an elephant into a fridge.
I said, 'Open the fridge.
fit in the elephant. Close the fridge.'
you know what the asshole told me?
I tell my right-hand man to do it.'
I dunno anything about the elephant story.
shit, cut the crap!
Hey, after the IMF period, when all the criminals blamed for the economic downfall were brought in by the bunches, that's what you fellas got a break simply because there was no room to put you in.
that was a real break you guys got, but it's different now.
15 years, I tell you.
what'll you do 15 years from now?
run a couple of bars?
help me out here, I'll give you five years.
sir.
you don't know me that well, do you?
the decision was made.
he got seven years.
did my name pop up during the trial?
not once.
Oh shit. Oh shit.
what a fucking bastard... - Hey, hey!
Oh man. Oh man!
let go!
where is this guy...
hey asshole!
how come you're still alive?
Oh man!
fuck...
my father. When did he die?
winter last year.
must've been tough trying to dig the grave.
frozen soil and all.
he was cremated. Ashes spread at the swamps at Yeosu.
I got there the wrong time at low tide.
so I waited six hours till the high tide arrived.
I have never been with my father that long.
Thanks.
you must resent us for not helping you out with the death penalty.
things were bad then, both for you and the boss.
don't you recognize him?
who?
that guy with the glasses.
he used to have some power in the government.
but he's been pegged as a communist and ended up here for life.
that guy beside him is the serial killer who killed 13 at Daejeon and Chunan.
Ah, back in the old days?
after having been given the death sentence, I was on the waiting list.
but the government got soft on me and I'm still living.
I'm close to those two guys, the two closest mates in here.
they'll be together till the moment they die.
if you watch those two closely, you'll see that they're not looking for much.
that's why they look so peaceful.
I'm no different.
resentment and remorse,
I don't have any.
let's eat.
they say you're a slasher.
faster hands.
I'll see you tomorrow.
he's the head of your room.
Oh. I, uh...
eat up.
how long did you get?
seven years.
that's a handful.
so, you'll stay here for 7 whole years?
I plan to leave next month.
want to get out together?
shut up and eat.
this guy here and him over there.
we're all in the same room.
get acquainted.
I heard a dumbass got in.
you look fine.
a sailor type, you.
he's in our room.
Soon-tan's friend, so take care of him.
good for you. Meeting a friend before you get fucked up.
and you car thief.
you eat and you pay, you sleep and you pay the rent.
what do you think this is, a sanitarium?
it's coming in this week,
I'll give it to ya.
how could I forget?
Yeah, yeah.
let's go eat.
I swear I'll get him and serve a couple more years.
you've gone through hard times.
I told the bastard to talk to you, and he starts a bloodshed.
I locked him up in jail, so no hard feelings, huh?
have you come to finish me off?
and the thing you developed recently.
I heard about it and it sounds interesting.
it sure does.
why, you want to take a cut?
it's about time I retire.
to old to be a gangster these days.
I need insurance, and it should work for the benefit of our region too.
I want you to do me a favor then.
my bowels hurt as hell.
I've been stabbed, you know.
that guy that stabbed me...
I want to live longer than him.
we'll have to settle this before next month.
our company's going through tough times.
we'll have to think hard about this.
that old bastard counts the days he'll live.
he sounds serious enough.
how long has Chi-sung worked with us?
your birthday next month marks a decade.
this is where Chi-sung is held.
it's nearby, so go visit him when you can.
no need.
bastards.
you make a living with a knife, you end up pretty much like the ones you stab.
Hey, lady.
you think we do this to make a living? Huh?
huh?
it's passion.
we hold knives right now, but see what we hold later on!
Hey, go! You're pissing me off.
those bastards get a shitload from me, and they still hang around.
is that being dumb or deaf?
stupid girl! Just wanted to help out...
Hey, come here! Come here and talk, come on!
come here!
what's come? - Hurry!
Oh! Brother.
we're here!
you look good! - Boss, it's you!
and Han-wook too. - Yeah.
don't worry about the company.
you'll be out in no time.
it's seven years, boss.
what? How do you bare seven years?
we'll talk to the right people, you'll cough a couple of times, and come out in no time.
we get kids out from the army like that too.
don't worry.
to us, there's Independence Day, and Christmas for special pardons.
in the old days it was humiliation, but that's the norm these days...
sir,
Soon-tan's alive.
Soon-tan. Remember him?
he isn't executed, and is still alive.
aren't you surprised?
he's still a dead guy to me.
it was good to see him in person.
relieves the pressure, you know.
I've bid farewell, so take care of him.
can't believe JUNG Soon-tan's still alive.
Hello, anybody home?
Hello, anybody home?
Hello?
Oh, you're there. How've you been?
Joo-jung.
I heard you've moved.
had a hard time looking for you.
how come the house is all wrapped up?
it's warm inside with the wrap.
is there adequate ventilation?
the boss knows. Since Chi-sung is behind bars,
he'll get a good place for you to stay.
a small apartment or something.
ain't taking money from a ganster.
an apartment, not money.
ain't got much to provide.
all this is good. It's delicious.
did you get insurance from our cousin?
Yeah, two.
why would a gangster need life insurance?
no one calls us gangsters.
we're businessmen.
we even get employment insurance.
Oh my, it's salty.
even medical insurance.
eat up.
if you go see Chi-sung, tell him this.
that we won't go visit him.
tell him to come out rehabilitated.
you sure don't sound like you're his folks.
you can all live in peace these days.
it was war in the past.
did Chi-sung have fast hands since he was a kid?
Hey, hey! We all had fast hands back then.
you guys must've heard about it, about Soon-tan.
the three of us were pals since the old days.
at the time we went all the way to Mokpo to beat up on the bad guys.
Oh, so JUNG Soon-tan's your friend too?
I heard he was a master with the knife.
I heard he did a big-time guy and got life sentence.
heard he's dead already.
give me a shot.
I heard he's still alive.
what?
Soon-tan. I heard from the boss when we went to visit Chi-sung.
that Soon-tan's still alive.
so what if he's still alive?
counting days before he gets executed.
and his whole family blew it, so he's got no one to take care of him.
who says the family blew it?
Han-wook told me.
the old geezer blew it, and almost had the boss end up in jail with a murder charge.
you're a loud mouth, aren't ya?
Bravo!
drink up everyone!
those bastards sure are loud.
are the bastards firemen or what?
what did you just say?
have you guys rented this place?
don't know which boyscout you guys are from, but you can just shut the fuck up and drink.
huh? Does the fucking gangster not care that we are from the Korean Air Force?
I just touched ground to find some idiot talk shit to me.
why beat someone up shouting bravo?
the asshole called me a gangster.
you are a gangster.
Oh man. I've been to the army.
I've got no tattoos on me.
I'm even a member of the Soon-chun UNESCO, and donate every month to the Doctors without Borders.
do I look like a gangster to you?
Bravo, bravo.
can't fucking believe this bastard's talking bravo again.
wait.
when a day comes,
I'll be around, so remember.
fucking bastard.
unpack and make yourself at home.
what the? The guy just disappeared!
it's okay. It's just a fridge we've got.
bring along the soju, too.
you're pretty.
you fucking bastard!
fucking asshole's crazy!
die, asshole!
so you guys are still digging?
Yeah, when time permits.
ut we've come across something hard, so we're taking a break.
we'll have to find something sharp to drill it.
by the way, did you do Kwang-ju's SUNG Bong-shik back in 2000?
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
wow, must've been a real highlight...
you work out in a gym or something?
dumbass. Fighting ain't learned in a gym.
who do you think will win if a taekwondo black belt fights a street fighter?
do you think a taekwondo guy can do SUNG Bong-shik?
I didn't do him.
just shoved it on his leg. We call it 'seven shoves on the thigh'.
we let him live. But with a bad leg.
we stab it seven times counting out loud.
I'm a taekwondo black belt, by the way.
kicking is my specialty.
what's up with the face?
Hey, I just want to do this guy and die in here.
can't believe they still have hazers around here.
I got beat pretty bad daring at him.
that shithead over there?
you just watch. I'll kill him.
must be hurting bad.
does it hurt?
are you serious?
Yeah.
he's been here a couple of days and already in solitary confinement?
sir, they say we can't visit Chi-sung.
he's in solitary for a mishap.
they say PARK Moon-su is still unconscious.
how did he do that in such short time?
I was so glad when I heard that.
it ain't just you, man.
Dong Chi-sung's really something.
a slasher famous in this region?
he did a couple of guys like a butcher.
they say he's a 'slasher faster than a gun'.
so he's the big guy around here now?
I heard he took care of a dozen at the subway in Mokpo.
I didn't know they had subways in Mokpo.
what the heck?
knock on the left wall.
what's on this side?
you're the psycho killer?
then you're the communist geezer?
what?
you want me to pass your words to this guy over here?
shit, you think I'm a messenger or what?
are you two guys dating each other?
you can talk in daytime.
that's all you guys do during the daytime.
what is this, Starbucks?
pass the words, bullshit.
fuck it.
why did I end up in a shithole like this?
Hey, going back to what you guys were talking about during the day.
what his grandson said is right.
he thinks so too. So an adult should learn from the younger ones.
Hehehe. Shit,
I ain't doing this no more.
you can talk tomorrow! Go to sleep!
this serum has been extracted from plants originating in Japan. You smell it, and you die.
but the chemicals that I developed neutralize the poison, which then becomes a terrific hallucinogen.
even made into gum or jelly for the cream of the crop.
so we can sell them at the convenience store.
excellent. Good job!
but I don't think you've done your part of the job.
it's being dealt with. Wait.
bullshit, man.
I ain't heard of fists that strong.
you're so funny.
so those trees got pulled out,
and everyone else got a licking from pops.
all the villagers ran away,
and the remaining folks threatened with spears.
the last battle was against a typhoon.
fighting against the rain and the wind, how could a man withstand that?
it's nature he was fighting against, you see.
I don't see the little kid.
someone came to visit him.
didn't know anyone would visit the fella.
you see Chi-sung often?
we're disappointed in him, if you know what I mean.
he's up to something.
we need someone like you around in times like this.
you're in there, you know.
think what you can do for us in there.
mark my words.
that guy you're familiar with... ain't the guy we know anymore.
sit down.
we should have some coffee together.
so, you were saying.
let's cut the crap and get to the point.
since when do slashers deal drugs?
what is this, a conglomerate?
I take a couple of years off after my leg got bad, and things have turned wild around here.
if age is coming on ya, take off.
it seems like our brother SUNG still has something to settle.
I know our Chi-sung has done bad things to you, and I should have visited you to apologize, but I was busy, ya know.
as I was saying, if age is coming on ya, take off.
why get advice from a crippled guy like me?
shit, I haven't heard the whole story, but who the hell are you?
a veteran from Vietnam?
stay out of this.
another hot temper, besides DONG Chi-sung, huh?
who're you?
I'm the right-hand man.
I think I just heard war, and from a ragpicker too.
hey asshole!
enough.
I thought DONG Chi-sung was the right-hand guy.
already a replacement?
I'm the right-hand guy.
Dong was the left-hand guy.
I'm left handed. - Sir.
so now that we've cleared which side is which, it's about time to clear the seats.
that car with the disabled sticker on, I would think that's yours.
should I get my people to start the engine?
I'm SUNG Bong-shik from Gwang-ju.
I got stabbed seven times on my thighs by DONG, and became crippled.
you guys stab on the legs when doing someone.
we start with the arms.
we went to see DONG's folks last night,
and you could be next, right-hand guy.
take care.
I'm leaving.
no... no... no...
Oh Fuck!
how did you come about?
I work nearby.
huh. I feel a little awkward.
so you're still caddying at the club?
they say it's bad for your skin, you know, pigeon layer or something gone bad.
it's ozone.
yeah...
so what's up?
Chi-sung.
Yeah.
listen carefully.
your father...
no, your father and mother... both of them...
they got stabbed, and they're in the hospital.
that fucking temper. Shit I hate it.
say that again?
hear me out clearly the first time I say it!
they got stabbed?
but my folks ain't gangsters...
Soon-tan.
do you get stabbed even if you're not a gangster?
I can't...
...see you.
so pull it out and go.
open up the gates!
Hurry!
who the fuck did it?
who fucking did DONG Chi-sung on his back, I'm fucking going to kill you!
let go, asshole!
my friend, who fucking stabbed him?
I'm fucking going to kill him!
let go, I say!
the poor bastard gets stabbed the day his folks get done!
I'll kill the fucking asshole before the wound heals!
let go! I'm JUNG Soon-tan!
I'm waiting for the day I die, dammit! I'm JUNG Soon-tan!
park Moon-su. Come out.
it ain't me.
I ain't done it.
I ain't stabbed anyone.
I didn't do it, man.
come on, give me a break!
sir!
I heard Chi-sung's at the hospital. Did you know?
hey asshole! He's been stabbed, and the one that did it is someone that we both know.
did you know?
I think the boss did the right thing.
the big guy taking care of the rest should be serene but wise.
let's just think that he did it for the sake of the company.
soon-tan getting death penalty. Was that also a wise decision?
the company's in a bad state, so you and I will get stabbed as well?
this isn't allowed, you know.
5 minutes. Period.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
did you see my dad?
he's on and off.
sung Bong-shik did it?
I know what really ticks you off.
I'm confused too.
do you know? Really?
your father gets hit.
so what's the company doing?
sung Bong-shik did the stabbing.
so why stab on your back too?
go and tell them.
anyone related to my name.
I'll go see them. Go tell.
the bastards that know my name, or have called my name even once,
I'll go see them all.
go tell.
this...
would not be the worst you've faced in your life.
do you really have to do that?
Yeah,
Chi-sung's still unconscious.
he's a vegetable now.
saw him myself.
let's get the machines going.
is that resent I sense?
doing your closest friend?
why didn't you ask me?
how could I watch someone else do my friend?
you should've had me to do it.
you always asked your right-hand guy to do it.
Soon-tan, or Chi-sung. That's why they're in jail.
I'm your right-hand guy now, so you should've told me to do it.
hello Sir!
hello Sir!
sung Bong-shik did this?
did a couple of tables and fled.
he must've taken care of the brewery too.
we're not getting any booze at the bars near the rotary.
the bastard! This means war!
they're not registered.
we won't have any problems as long as we don't hold them when we're caught.
we're outnumbered, and we don't know what else will come at us?
times sure have changed.
now we won't have to train the kids no more.
I'll go on a workshop with the top-tier guys.
they'll need to learn how to use this.
air Force fighters will be training at midnight.
don't panic because of the noise.
tell you again.
air Force fighters will be training at midnight.
don't panic because of the noise.
Chi-sung's back.
it's Chi-sung. He's back!
the condemned criminal above is to be executed...
how do you feel?
it hurts.
How've you been?
that tastes great.
you're going? Tonight?
life's a promenade anyway.
I regret doing this...
I know it wasn't easy on you in here, me being a young guy in charge and all.
in your next life, be a good man.
even if you do sin, be a clever man and don't get caught.
not knowing when I'll follow suit,
I wish to go clean.
draw the most virtuous and beautiful picture on me.
no one can punish me, so no one can forgive me.
I wish to forgive myself...
and be reborn.
I want to die that way.
I'm reborn.
let's get out of this place.
plans can change according to who's in or not.
excavating can't be done in a day or two,
through the ventilation tubes, we'll head to the sewerage.
the sewerage will be complicated.
can we make it out?
I've called on my guys. Don't worry.
my father? - He's fine.
mother? - Fine as well.
my brother at Miari? - As usual.
did Suk-ja give birth? - Yeah, twins.
how's my uncle? - Fine too.
and my aunt's store? - Earning tons.
brother-in-law?
got married again last week.
what happened to my sister?
getting married again next month. - Oh. Okay.
it's the air base runway on this side.
we can't go that way.
and... the army base on this side.
let's go back.
what, we're turning back?
how come does army guys are around here when the DMZ's up there?
shit, man.
Hey, Chi-sung. You gonna take the boss out when you're outta here?
he said he was just gonna ask why he got dumped.
shit, you can give him a call to find that out.
Hey, you've got the date set to die, so you've got nothin' to lose.
I've got my reasons.
I have to see my wife.
make it easier and have her come visit you.
we don't really have to head out.
only three years left.
making a family tree. Ain't it awesome?
we'll make up a new family like this!
bullshit.
you like being a gangster?
no, I just hate being a car thief.
it's Ionely, and not an easy job, you know.
don't get the wrong impression.
there's no good gangster anywhere.
knights, justice... It's all bullshit.
a gangster is just a gangster.
Ditto for car thieves.
fuck!
what is this?
I heard you were doing something intriguing?
hey Chi-sung. I got four years left.
I can't wait for that.
can you... count me in?
let's go the simple way.
tear down the walls.
50 meters left of the main entrance, they rebuilt it last year.
they mixed sea sand on the concrete, so it's pretty weak, besides it's only two meters deep, and will go down if fifty of us rammed it
Hey, the World Trade Center went down because they used sea sand!
new York's by the sea.
will fifty people do?
should I gather a hundred?
go, go, go!
february 9, 2000 Morgue, U, S, Army Base - Yongsan, Korea
Mr. Kim.
I hate dust more than anything.
I'll... I'll clean again.
you don't have to clean up now.
why don't you dump this first?
that's formalin.
formaldehyde, to be precise.
to be even more precise, dirty formaldehyde.
every bottle is coated with layers of dust.
pour them into the sink.
excuse me?
just empty every bottle to the very last drop.
it's just... they are toxic chemicals and the regulation states that...
pour them right down the drain, Mr. Kim.
if I pour them in the drain, they'll run into the Han River.
that's right.
let's just dump them in the Han River.
but, you know, this is not just any toxic chemical...
the Han River is very broad, Mr. Kim.
let's try to be broad-minded about this.
anyway, that's an order.
so, start pouring.
june 2002, Han River
what the heck is this?
what?
that's pretty gross.
is it a mutation?
is it dead?
no, it moved a second ago.
yeah? Wait...
my cup!
that was close.
my daughter gave me this cup.
look, it's swimming away.
how many tails does that thing have?
you got me. Makes your skin crawl.
Mr. Yoon! - Sir! October 2006, Han River Bridge
what the hell are you doing?
don't do it!
No! No!
did you guys see that?
underneath...
in the water!
something dark in the water...
you really didn't see it?
what the hell are you talking about?
morons, to the very end.
have a good life.
the HOST
welcome, what would you like?
how much is this? - 75 cents.
Ah... Not again... Lift your head.
one, two, three... Here you are.
daddy!
Hyun-seo? Hyun-seo...
wait for me!
now that you're awake...
three squids for mat #4, roast them quickly.
gosh, how much sleep can a body take?
director BONG Joon-ho
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
here you are.
Oh, that hurts.
did your uncle do a good job?
he came, at least.
I was worried.
I was the only one whose uncle came to parents' day.
that's why I kept calling, but you didn't answer.
why didn't you answer?
you think this phone can receive signals?
I'm too embarrassed to use it in public. You take it.
what's wrong with it?
Oh, and about uncle...
I could smell alcohol on him when he stood in the back of class.
that punk, getting drunk at this hour.
Hasrt it started, Grandpa?
what?
today's Nam-joo's competition, aren't we gonna watch?
Oh, Nam-joo! Right...
why isn't it on?
you know what this is? - What?
I'm saving up to get you a new phone.
there's a lot, huh?
they're all dimes! That'll never be enough.
there are some quarters, too...
what's this penny doing here?
this is all from the change box, huh? I'll tell Grandpa.
go ahead, tell the geezer. - Geezer?
it's a dead body.
today morning, Han river in Seoul That's gross.
today morning, Han river in Seoul Why aren't they showing the game anyway?
today morning, Han river in Seoul Turn to 505. The sports channel.
Oh, there it is!
I made that for her. Aunt!
a bullseye every time!
park Nam-joo! - Grandpa!
the old man has to run the shop, let's watch it ourselves.
what do you mean? We all need to support her.
grandpa!
let the geezer roast some squid.
a straw...
let's have a cold one. Here.
this is alcohol!
you're in middle school now.
what? Are you really my father? - When your daddy was in middle...
alright! The semi-finals!
Wow. She looks tough.
it's bitter!
go, Park Nam-joo!
who else could take so long to take a shot? Park Nam-joo, Kyungki, Suowon city hall - Oh, it started. - Nam-joo is on. You gonna watch?
gold medal time!
I can't watch my daughter's matches, I get too nervous.
gold medal this time!
Gang-du.
yeah? - Come outside.
I have to watch this. - Come on out.
now!
I received a complaint from mat #4.
their squid had only nine legs.
did you eat one?
no...
don't deny it! Why touch other people's things?
think of it from the customer's perspective. A squid...
the torso tastes delicious, but the legs.
especially the longest one, has got something special, right?
from a paying customer's perspective, it's important.
take this to mat #4. Tell them it's on the house.
mat #4, - I've brought your order. - Oh, put it down there.
what are you looking at?
there's something there. Come on.
there, under the bridge. - See it?
do you see it? - How long has it been there?
it's been a while. - I told you.
Ah, it's construction equipment.
something they hung...? - No.
don't think so. It's moving.
Yeah, it just moved. Did it?
bullseye!
she's amazing!
I'm not just saying that because she's my daughter.
how could she hit the exact center like that?
right!
I can't believe it!
let's close the stand today.
it's going in.
it's huge
God, it's huge
did you see that? He ate the can!
maybe, it's dolphine. - All in one gulp.
have some beer nuts too!
it swam off.
it's gone now.
it's an amazonian river dolphin for sure.
this time there are ten legs. Mister.
this time there are ten legs. Count them yourself.
run away! Everyone run away!
in Kyung-boo high way has little bit of traffic jam, the traffic is going slow from Soowon to Dongjak bridge,
the way of Pusan,
open up!
Young-Ho!
my son must be in there.
someone help, please!
there are people in there. I gotta go help.
Hey, mister, my kid...
Donald, don't go. Come on, Donald. Come back!
you're gonna get hurt. Donald!
Hey, hey, hey!
let me help! Let me help!
Hey, man! Hey, man! You're not gonna get this door open.
Hey!
Donald! Where're you going?
Donald! Come Back!
faster! Let's go!
throw it hard!
Donald!
semi-finals, - Shoot!
this is the last shot of the semi-finals,
Ooh, now is not the time to lower her bow,
shoot!
because if she goes over the clock,
shoot!
Oh no! The clock!
you could have just let go.
park's Achilles'heel is taking too long to release,
and today it cost her the title,
she shouldn't have done that, She wasted much time,
at this point, Park can only hope Yoon Ock-hee, Kyungbook Yecheon county office advanced to the final of individual woman for the bronze,
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo! - Hey, come back!
Gang-du!
Hyun-seo! - Hold anything!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
sir!
sir!
you have ten minutes to clear the area!
please take care of your things and evacuate.
restricted Area
come on.
Nam-joo.
Hyun-seo!
it's bronze. Bronze.
your aunt brought you a bronze medal.
Hyun-seo, it's your aunt...
Hyun-seo...
Hyun-seo...
Hyun-seo, your uncle came.
thanks to you, we're all together...
Hyun-seo!
let go of me!
what are you taking pictures of?
what's so goddamn interesting? Fuck off!
stop taking pictures!
calling the owner of a Hyundai car, plate # 2487!
hey lady, how could you park your car there?
so you screwed up?
I heard everything.
you grabbed some other girl's hand?
you left Hyun-seo on the ground?
your own daughter!
you call yourself a fucking father?
you son of a bitch!
I thought it was Hyun-seo's hand...
she's so pretty in that photo.
she looks just like her mom in that photo.
do you think her mom even knows that she died?
not a chance.
it's been 13 years since she popped out the baby and ran off.
I'd run away too, dammit.
are you sleeping? Huh?
Nam-il...
you can sleep at a time like this?
what are you doing to your brother?
her birth was an accident...
and so was her death...
old people have always said, that an animal which kills a human should be torn limb from limb.
that it's a humars duty to do so.
until I slit that beast's stomach and at least find Hyun-seo's body,
I'll never leave this world in peace.
attention please!
ladies and gentlemen, those of you present at the river incident...
there are probably a lot of you here...
this is an important matter of life and death.
those who were at the scene...
or those who have come in contact with these people!
raise your hands!
this isn't something you should hide.
raise your hands.
if you go home, it might affect your families. Raise 'em high!
Hey, mister.
what the hell is going on here?
fuck, shouldn't you start by explaining what's happening?
yeah - Explain!
an explanation should be appearing on the TV news now.
to save time, we'll let the news serve as explanation.
okay, the news... the news...
take off that shit and speak! ...isn't on now.
shit...
anyway, from this moment.
you fall under our control, so start moving!
this is for your own safety.
we have transport buses waiting outside now.
okay, please move toward the buses in an orderly fashion.
that's right. Watch your children.
Oh, did anyone here touch or come into direct contact with the creature?
um... I didn't touch it.
but some of its blood got sprayed in my face.
don't move! Tell him to freeze!
grab him! Grab that one!
please remain calm, people.
what are you doing? My son didn't touch anything!
let go!
why are you doing this?
Gang-du! Get out of there! - Dad!
don't go! - Dad!
Gang-du, don't worry. I'm coming with you.
stop that! Hey, number 31! Stop!
this is a news flash,
it now appears that the creature, which disappeared after its attack, on surprised parkgoers today, is far more dangerous than previously assumed,
U, S, Army Sgt, Donald White, who fought bravely with the creature, and lost an arm in the process, is now undergoing treatment at a U, S, Army hospital,
after a thorough examination, U, S, Army medical staff have identifed, an unknown virus, primarily in body parts, that came into contact with the creature,
I can't give any of that inform ation without the approval of the United States, which confirmed that the creature from the Han River, as with the Chinese civet wild cat and SARS, is THE HOSTof this deadly new virus,
all military units sent to pursue and capture the creature, have been recalled due to the risk of infection,
only special forces trained in biological warfare, and disinfectant units are allowed access to the Han River area,
damn, they made a fuss dragging us in here!
what is this shit?
where are all the guys in yellow?
look!
the doctors aren't even wearing masks.
Hello, sir!
when might we be allowed to go home?
you can't go home. - What? We can't?
dad, am I dying?
don't say that!
just do what the doctors tell you.
but Dad, my back feels itchy and weird. Like something's moving.
Ah, shit...
it's a squirmy feeling, like something's there.
it's because you never take a bath, it's okay.
attention! Numbers 25-40, raise your hands. Quickly!
this group, move to room 904 now.
not again!
don't tell anyone about the blood on your face, okay?
Mr. Park Gang-du? - Yes?
you need to take a lot of tests, so don't eat until tomorrow morning.
what? Don't eat anything?
don't feed him anything! No food!
Hello?
Hello?
my battery is, Hello?
it's me, Hyun-seo!
dad, can you hear me? Please answer me!
is this Hyun-seo?
dad, listen to me! I can't get out!
you're alive? Where...?
it's like a big sewer, Really big and deep,
where? Hello?
Hyun-seo...
come quick! - Hyun-seo
is it Hyun-seo?
what is it?
did you see that?
what? - Wait a minute.
sweet!
Hey!
Hey, don't go near the water.
be careful!
let's go. I'm starving.
it's okay, get back in.
mister! Mister!
try to turn...
your daughter, Park Hyun-seo, a seventh grader at Dangsan Middle School.
she's on the deceased list.
Yes, she goes to Dangsan School...
she's deceased, but she's not dead.
I mean, she died, but she's still alive.
now you're talking in circles.
so, she's on the list...
wait, shut up.
at any rate, there was a call. - Right.
so shouldn't you be able to trace the call or something?
trace the call?
that's not something we do for just anyone.
are you even aware of how complicated that is?
just anyone' is that what you said?
stop it! Step back!
what the...
please, officer, let's talk like reasonable people.
they're just kids, don't... - What are you doing?
no, I mean...
your daughter never called you in the first place, okay?
your son had a dream, but it was so real that...
you don't believe anything we said?
now you're obstructing an officer in the line of duty...
step back, Nam-joo.
officer, should I explain it again?
the way it happened was...
I know, I know. You yourself saw your daughter die.
but she called you in the middle of the night?
does that make any sense? That's completely ridiculous!
a servant of the people, talking back like that?
then what's your problem? - Just a moment...
stop!
this is...
this is my daughter Park Hyun-seo. My daughter...
I'm the creature.
I ate her... Okay? And then...
it happened like this. This is the sewer.
you don't understand?
he's received psychological treatment?
he's not a bad man, but he's in shock. We should understand.
Hey. - I knew it!
officer! My daughter is alive in the sewer!
officer? - Cut it out!
your putting on a damn show doesn't help!
my friend's nephew's husband's brother-in-law is a cop, maybe we should contact him...?
right, I'm sure he'd bend over backwards for us.
you're a college graduate, can't you even persuade a cop?
what's college got to do with it?
I put you through school selling cup ramen, and you...
dad. - Huh?
how long's it been since she's eaten? Down in the sewer?
what's there to eat down there?
you over there!
hey blondie, stop!
run!
out of the way!
catch them!
out of the way! Quick!
this way! Hurry up!
Gang-du, hurry up!
which floor? - Close the door! Quick!
I'm coming down, but I'm in the elevator, so...
where is he?
what did I just say?
A3. Where's A3?
there it is!
stop! Catch that car.
Hurry! Open the door!
go! Step on it!
Nam-joo! - Hurry up!
where is Nam-joo?
where is she?
did they catch her?
Oh, shit. - Where?
where?
there, there! - Where?
over there.
that idiot!
how could you leave your only sister?
we can pick her up! - Pick her up then!
she's always been slow... - Mister, can you stop here?
hurry up!
what a dimwit!
hurry it up, will you? - Quick! Quick!
Hey, family! Everyone stop. Stop the van.
Hey, stop!
just close it! Close!
did we make it?
that does it.
this won't do.
the basic fee for pickup and the items you ordered is 7, 400 dollars.
including the Han River sewer map.
Plus, we brushed off a cop in the parking lot, and two police cars on the road.
anyway, including hazard fees, the total is 11, 400 dollars.
one of the escaping family...
wow, Gang-du on TV!
that's my citizen ID photo.
it's from one of those subway photo booths?
Hey, we should tape this and show it to Hyun-seo. Daddy on TV...
Jesus...
we don't accept these. If you're short on cash, we accept cards.
we'll just take the card.
the blonde one, who made direct contact with it,
he's the stupidest of all,
that bitch! Listen to the mouth on her.
he pounced on me and slammed me to the floor,
I think he gave me arthritis, I'll need treatment, I'm sure,
that's what he's like,
I know who she is.
like we can't recognize her through that voice disguiser?
but they keep reporting on us.
the superior archer who escaped In addition, the daughter among the escaped family members
the superior archer who escaped is confirmed to be Park Nam-joo, national bronze medalist in archery,
what the hell? How come there's nothing about me?
there's nothing special about you.
plenty of unemployed university grads these days...
I sacrificed my youth for the democratization of our country, and those fuckers won't even give me a job.
the passwords are all 4989?
there's a white truck outside.
it's a disinfection truck, you can take it.
expressed concern that Korea is not adequately quarantining, - the infected, The U, S, also, - Come on, let's go.
that's the truck?
does it really work?
this is what you got after spending all your assets?
this gun is... Fuck, we're not boy scouts.
and why only two disinfectant suits?
so two of us should just creep around hiding?
dad, shouldn't this be yellow?
if it's not yellow, they're bound to catch us.
wow, this map is the topping on the cake.
the red circles indicate sewers?
you spent 500 dollars on this?
Really?
but... I got it from a civil servant who knows the sewer system.
it's photocopied on the back of used paper.
Hey, a guard post. Get down!
cover up, quickly! Your blonde hair is showing.
get down quickly!
whatever, you two handle it.
biohazard
what? If that's their attitude, why even bother?
bunch of lazy bums.
quiet! Stop.
Mr. Park?
Mr. Bacteria?
lower your mask.
this definitely a Daesung disinfectant truck.
but are you Daesung people?
Yes, but we're a different team.
Oh, really?
I'm Manager Cho from the district office.
don't you know who I am?
you know that 14 different companies are doing the fumigation on shifts?
but Daesung just barged in at the end.
to the other companies, it seems odd.
so I spoke with President Kwak yesterday...
not this! No!
let go...
manager Cho, this is all I have with me right now.
sorry, I'll see you later.
Hey, Gang-du.
Hyun-seo. It's your Dad.
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
park Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
Hyun-seo!
why does he have to do that? He's not a kid.
let him be.
he wants to disinfect himself.
he's worried he'll pass the virus on to Hyun-seo.
virus...
all of us are fine, why do they keep going on about a fucking virus?
if the government says so, we have to accept it. What can we do?
is it the virus that's making me so sleepy?
Hyun-seo...
look on the ground for footprints.
Hey, did Hyun-seo describe any special traits of the sewer?
special traits?
we need some kind of hint here.
Hyun-seo said it was a big sewer. Look how big this is.
Yes, it seems we'll find something.
Yeah, sure! Wandering blindly through the sewers...
we need to think of a better way.
stop complaining! Put your time into searching another sewer instead.
hey tortoise! Just try to keep up. Slow-ass bronze medalist.
you wanna die? - Wait!
Hyun-seo! Hyun-seo!
turn it off.
something moved there.
move!
it's this way!
get down!
what is this?
it's just water!
God damn it!
how typical of you.
sorry, Dad.
did you pee?
because of the bangs, a little.
why are they going around shooting?
wow, this cave really does lead to the Han River!
it's not a cave, it's a sewer.
they're all connected like this.
gosh, it's hard to make a living.
do we really have to go?
so you're not hungry?
no, I'm hungry!
if we do this once, we'll eat well for a whole month.
don't you know that? - I do.
wow, there's money too.
don't touch it.
why not? I'm taking it.
if we take that too, it's theft.
put it back now, okay?
we're stealing from this place anyway.
Se-joo, this is not theft.
we're now doing 'seo-ri'.
like melon seo-ri at a farm.
Hey, do you even know what seo-ri means?
no? The generation gap is pretty big.
it's an old borrowing game kids play. So, seo-ri is a right of the hungry.
run!
to the world and to the potential jury pool, you are the man who murdered his pregnant wife and unborn son.
I need you to start demonstrating the zeal that comes with defending an innocent man.
daddy!
Hey, baby!
your client murdered my sister, Ms. Frutt.
I won't be cooperating much with his defense.
do you think your mom killed herself?
I know my dad didn't kill her.
he loved her.
so I think she must have committed suicide.
Alan, What's up?
something came up at Carruthers I left.
now I'm looking for new employment.
what exactly came up at Carruthers, Alan?
I embezzled. Allegedly.
I'm going through an enormous character growth.
just the same.
and I need a break.
this is the agreement that you had me type up?
tantamount to insurance fraud.
is that wrong?
why are we whispering?
she has a headache.
she?
God.
she gets headaches?
and cramps.
explains a lot, don't you think?
I want you to allow me to settle this case.
no.
assuming you do hear God's thoughts, persuading a jury of that reality will be difficult for me.
I win my cases.
I had the highest winning percentage of any litigator in my firm.
they had no right to fire me.
sometimes we need to forgive those who trespass against us.
not.
we're on Day 3 of Bradley Stanfield's double murder trial.
it's not known when the prosecution is going to rest.
sources say . . .
Hey, damn it!
cause of death: cyanide poisoning.
and the cyanide entered Mrs. Stanfield's system how, Doctor?
ingestion.
traces found in coffee.
now, Doctor, are you aware that a suicide note was found?
ridiculous.
I'm sorry?
cyanide poisoning.
violent death.
nobody commit suicide that way.
doctor, did the cyanide come in liquid or solid form?
powder.
powder.
so one way for it to have gotten into the coffee would be for somebody to simply pour it into her cup.
right, Doctor?
Yes.
and another way, somebody could have put it into the coffee grounds.
isn't that correct, Doctor?
could happen.
so the poison could have been put into the coffee long before - perhaps days before - it was bought and consumed by the victim.
isn't that right, Doctor?
could happen.
doctor, what can you tell me about Molly Stanfield's personality?
nothing.
not psychologist.
well, Doctor, suicide goes very much to the psychology of the victim.
you're up here trying to rule out suicide and you know nothing about Molly Stanfield.
you can't rule out suicide, can you, Doctor?
the cause of action is wrongful termination under the state's Employment Practices Act.
we already filed to the MCAD to no avail.
when were you fired?
june.
we have a settlement conference scheduled for 11 o'clock.
failing settlement . . .
excuse me. Can I just stop you for a sec?
surely.
Jimmy, I don't mind your looking at me.
in fact, I'm even flattered.
but would you mind keeping each stare to 8 seconds total in duration?
anything longer than that is just an invasion of my privacy.
eight seconds or less, Jimmy. Okay?
sure.
now, if we don't settle,
I'd like to have you second-chair the trial.
your "plain folks" style could be an asset.
a lot of jurors today relate to the phonetically-challenged.
excuse me?
I mean that as a compliment, Jimmy.
you're the "Every Man."
I'm not a simple person.
I'm very deep.
Yes.
and what I'd be looking for is for you to go to your depths, and say to the jury, "Not fair."
can you do that?
one, two, three.
a drug overdose is one thing. But cyanide?
why not? It's quick.
and violent.
there are headaches, vomiting, possible suffocation.
it's an ugly death
it's not possible Molly Stanfield wanted to die ugly?
I suppose it's possible, but as I said, I've never seen it.
also, the note.
when people leave notes, typically it's to provide explanation or to say goodbye.
here we have, "I do not choose to live" - typed, unsigned.
you think the note was a fake.
Yes, scripted by somebody who wanted us to think it was a suicide.
sounds like whoever did this was pretty sloppy.
certainly unconvincing.
or maybe very clever.
maybe the victim made it look like a phony suicide, hoping the police would suspect her husband of murder.
I beg your pardon?
this marriage was marked by a lot of anger, Doctor, if not hatred.
isn't it possible Molly Stanfield decided to check out, and take her husband down in the process?
is that what you think happened?
or somebody else killed her, knowing the police always look to the spouse.
can you positively rule that out?
that somebody else killed her?
let me put it this way:
who besides my client did you investigate?
you can't be willing to take this to trial.
Oh, but we can.
she was terminated for a disability. That's against the law.
she was terminated for not being able to fulfill the function of the job.
one such function being client relations.
she claims God talks to her, for God's sake!
she claims bald men access her thoughts.
you seem upset.
I am upset!
we're wasting valuable time here.
how can you be willing to go forward with this?
she will be publicly revealed as a loon.
which you are, Sheila!
may I speak off the record?
as recently as five months ago, you, Mr. Lambert, and my client had rather vigorous sexual relations.
do you recall that, Mr. Lambert?
do you, Sheila?
vividly.
what is this? An extortion attempt?
Oh, extortion is a very bad thing.
I would never . . .
however ...
umm, one of my favorite words, however.
don't you like that word?
love it.
however.
I would have to introduce this carnal episode as an admission on Mr. Lambert's part that he considered my client to be both competent and sane.
how do you figure that?
well, Mr. Ginsberg, certainly if he had relations with a person who, to his mind, lacked capacity to consent to said relations .
what's the word I'm looking for now?
heavens?
rape.
in Massachusetts, having sex with the incompetent . . .
was it heavens?
rape.
right.
you're now using the threat of a criminal trial to advance a civil claim. Mr. Shore that's grounds for disbarment.
I don't believe I did that.
but why don't you go report me?
see how it all unfolds.
two point six million dollars, gentlemen - that's your "out."
I want to see my niece.
when the meeting is over, they will come out . . .
I am that child's guardian.
actually, her father is still the legal guardian, and it's my understanding you want him convicted.
if you interfere with our defense, what you'll be doing, is giving him grounds for a new trial.
I don't think you want that.
now, please.
sit over there and wait, while I check on your niece.
all right.
first, this Shore guy is totally corrupt.
second, the client is nuts.
she thinks God talks to her.
excuse me?
she also thinks bald men access her thoughts.
and if you stare at her more than 8 seconds, you invade her privacy.
and Shore?
he just tried extorting the lawyer.
he's a crook.
come on, honey.
Christine?
listen, I know you're not sympathetic to our case, here.
you're using a ten-year-old girl as a trial prop.
how could anyone be sympathetic to that?
if you try to interfere with Emma's involvement, we will assert our rights against you.
come on, honey.
you calling the daughter?
I don't know.
all she has to say is his mother seemed sad.
we're thinking about accusing Christine.
her? The sister?
she has no alibi.
they didn't get along.
basically, we've got nothing else.
I think I can sell it.
are you out of your mind?
it's called "Plan B."
we use it on occasion when Plan A is sure to fail.
what about Emma's testimony? She'll support suicide.
none of us feel Emma will help us.
in fact, we think trying to exploit her further could even hurt.
well, my testimony . . .
and we don't think you should testify, either.
there's too much to impeach you with.
right now, your domestic assault isn't in evidence.
if you testify, Bradley, it comes into play.
what is our defense?
reasonable doubt.
all we need to show is that it's possible somebody else did it including possibly, your sister-in-law.
we know it's desperate.
we're not kidding ourselves. But it's something, Bradley.
we do not commit blackmail in this firm.
we do not resort to extortion or any other criminal offenses to settle our claims.
Eugene, I give you my word.
I would never get caught.
I will report you to the bar myself.
Jimmy, I brought you in on this case because I sensed a connection between us.
you brought me in because you think I'm simple.
simple would be speaking directly with the person you have issues with, Jimmy.
going behind my back -
that makes you complicated.
you're no longer invited to play on my team, Jimmy.
my sister was a devout Catholic.
suicide is considered against God.
she also was not a woman to indulge in self-pity.
nothing kept that woman down, no matter what the setback.
could she have privately been unhappy?
no.
if anything, she seemed happier lately.
she was in love.
in love with . . ?
she had a boyfriend.
I didn't approve, but I was at least hopeful that it would get her out of her involvement with him.
him? You observed your sister with him?
Yes.
it was increasingly more and more angry to the point that I felt that it was extremely unhealthy for Emma.
clearly it turned out to be unhealthy for Molly as well.
you said she was a devout Catholic.
are you?
Yes, I am.
is it possible, knowing how opposed you were to suicide, that your sister concealed her plans to take her life?
this was not a suicide, and I am finding this repulsive.
you seem angry.
I am.
you and your sister often got angry with each other, didn't you?
we had our differences - primarily over the war zone that they subjected Emma to.
just out of curiosity:
where were you the day your sister died?
I beg your pardon?
I don't mean to be rude, but if my client should be convicted of this murder, he'd be disqualified from inheriting, and you'd get more of your sister's money, wouldn't you?
are you suggesting I killed my sister?
I'm just suggesting that you had keys to her house, that you knew her coffee-drinking patterns.
did the police ever investigate you?
no, they did not.
a year ago, you tried to get custody of Emma, because you considered your sister to be an unfit parent.
I considered them both unfit because of the way they fought continually in front of Emma.
you love Emma very much.
like a daughter. Yes, I do.
and if your sister dies, and your brother-in-law gets convicted of this crime, you would get custody of Emma wouldn't you Christine?
everything would work out.
you are disgusting!
one dollar?
Yes, Mr. Shore.
that is our offer.
one dollar - and it's final.
we were offended by your little extortion attempt yesterday, and we're perfectly willing to go to trial on Thursday.
and when we do, it's going to get out that your client is insane.
her peers are going to learn that she is deeply, deeply deluded, and she will likely be unemployable forever.
so, go ahead, Mr. Shore -
advise your client to move forward with this claim.
counsel her that it is in her best interest to do so.
and you?
why don't you just talk it over with God.
let me tell you something.
Mr. Ginsberg, what you've done, unwittingly or not, is turn the matter personal.
when a case becomes personal to me, Mr. Ginsberg my priorities shift.
my goal becomes not so much to vindicate, but rather to avenge.
my mission now is to get you.
the meeting is over.
you may go.
blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the land.
blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice, for they will get their fill.
rest?
what about my testimony?
we agreed you shouldn't testify since . . .
I never agreed.
you agreed.
if you take the stand, your domestic assault comes into evidence.
and if I don't go up there, we have no defense.
our case is reasonable doubt.
it's burden of proof.
we've already established the possibility of suicide.
we've established the possibility of somebody else killing her.
that's the best we can do here.
no, it isn't.
if you take the stand, you are guaranteed a guilty . . .
you listen to me!
from my perspective, I've already bought the guilty verdict.
I do not want to rest.
if you get . . .
I'm talking.
like you said from the start, everyone thinks I'm guilty.
I'm the sick bastard who killed his pregnant wife and unborn child.
well, people need to hear from me now.
my daughter needs to hear from me.
then do it behind closed doors.
I will do it in that room!
I have made a life of being liked, Ellenor.
look at my face.
every job I've gotten, every woman . . .
it's 'cause I'm trustworthy.
I'm sympathetic, I make a favorable impression.
Brad, I agree with Ellenor.
you testifying would not be a good idea.
I will take that stand, and I will make a favorable impression.
I will tell my story, and they will cry for me.
you understand me?
we understand you perfectly.
I'm actually really excited about the trial.
there's no greater rush of adrenaline.
and I'm looking forward to working together again - you and me - too.
I thought we gelled perfectly at that first settlement conference.
you know, our rhythms weretogether, it was kinda like . . . sex.
what do you think about me presenting the open?
there's no better way of showing off my skills as a litigator.
did you get a message just then?
from God?
as a matter of fact, I did.
Why?
I was just wondering.
so what do you think about me opening?
I think it sounds good.
okay.
listen, I need to meet with your doctors tomorrow.
Why?
to prepare their testimony.
why would we be calling doctors?
we're basing our claim on disability law, so I'll need to present evidence of . . .
my disability. I have none, Alan.
when I try cases, Sheila,
I don't like surprises.
therefore, I would like to meet with your doctors.
why don't I give you all the surprises right now?
I have no doctors.
you're not being treated by anybody?
why should I be?
because God speaks to me?
that doesn't make me ill, and it doesn't make me any less of a lawyer.
I thought I'd have meat.
I'm on the Atkins diet, so let's bring on the protein.
in what certainly promises to be the most dramatic moment of the trial,
Brad Stanfield will sit in the witness chair and presumably deny that he killed his pregnant wife, Molly, and their unborn son, Michael.
you called, Eugene?
Yes.
I wanted to meet our new client.
Ahh!
why is she hiding behind you?
you're bald, Eugene.
you can access her thoughts.
may I have a word with you, please, Alan?
certainly.
are you serious about tryin" this case?
quite.
the woman thinks God speaks to her?
she does.
as senior partner, I'm directing you to either settle or enter your withdrawal.
this firm cannot and will not proceed to court with that cause of action.
may I respond?
please.
the client merely thinks you can access her thoughts because of your baldness, Eugene.
but if I'm not mistaken, you're not bald -
you shave your head. If I may?
just as I thought.
nubs.
it's all a big misunderstanding.
I'll let her know.
you do not amuse me.
I sense that.
it wasn't a perfect marriage.
I had an affair once.
turns out, she was having one.
but, still, you didn't want a divorce?
no. We had a daughter.
for both Molly and me,
Emma was everything.
and, uh . . .
and what, Brad?
and despite our battles, my love for Molly was as strong as ever.
I resisted the divorce simply 'cause I...
I couldn't imagine life without her.
that may make me weak but uh, it's the truth.
did you kill your wife, Bradley?
no. I didn't.
uh, she - she was pregnant with my son - a son I had dreamed of.
the idea that I could take a life - any life - but to accuse me of killing Molly?
or Michael?
you heard it mentioned that your sister-in-law, Christine, might have had both motive and opportunity.
I can't believe Christine could be capable of this. I . . .
she and Molly had battles, and I know she wanted custody of Emma, but this was her own sister.
did Molly have any other enemies?
I mean, obviously she had secrets -
I didn't know about the affair - but no enemies that I knew of.
Brad, you have to understand why you're a suspect.
you have a troubled marriage, your wife wants to leave you, and she's suddenly found poisoned to death in your home with no signs of anybody else being there but you.
I would never be capable of taking a human life.
I could never hurt the woman that I love more than life.
you could never hurt her.
a year ago, the police were called to your house once because you hit her.
once, during an argument, I lashed out.
I'm ashamed of that.
you're ashamed.
and when the police questioned you after finding her dead, you didn't tell them of your affair, did you?
no, I - I was . . .
ashamed.
objection.
the police asked if you and your wife had any domestic problems.
you answered,"No."
that was a lie, wasn't it, Mr. Stanfield?
I didn't imagine that I was a suspect at the time of that question that . . . I thought my marriage was a private matter.
I see.
you also told the police that you tried to revive your wife.
Yes, after I found her,
I performed chest compressions, mouth-to-mouth . . .
Yes. You said you tried to breathe air into her lungs.
and yet, we found no traces of your saliva on her mouth.
in fact, there was no smudging even of her lipstick, Mr. Stanfield.
did you not touch her lips as you performed mouth-to-mouth?
I thought I did.
you thought you did.
the night before Molly's death, the neighbors heard you and your wife screaming at each other from inside your home.
what was the fight about, Mr. Stanfield?
we argued a lot in our marriage. I said so.
that particular argument . . .
she complained that I worked too much that I was a . . . an absentee husband.
that's what the fight was about?
Yes.
one neighbor - Martin Reed, who is seated right there -
he heard you screaming at your wife, "Do you love him?"
did she love who, Mr. Stanfield?
I do not recall saying that.
you stated to the police and testified again today that you didn't learn of your wife's affair until after her death.
and yet, the night before, you were heard screaming, "Do you love him?"
as I said before, I don't remember saying that.
I knew nothing about her affair.
not good.
how bad?
all six voted guilty.
unequivocally.
uh, what are you talking about?
I hired a focus group to monitor the trial.
they found your testimony unconvincing and unanimously rejected it.
all right.
look. I would like to explore murder two.
absolutely not!
that is a life sentence, Ellenor!
with the possibility of parole.
I - I don't know what to tell you. We are going to lose, here.
we are dead!
daddy, let me tell!
Emma, please. Be quiet.
daddy, you said you . . .
tell what?
nothing. Could . . .
could I have a moment alone with my daughter, please?
Hey.
Hey! I'm working on my opening. Do you wanna hear it?
in a second.
I need you to listen to me, Sheila.
the reason I so readily took this case, aside from my tremendous affection for you, is because I know, your eccentricities notwithstanding, you've always been a fierce and brilliant litigator, and I have never, ever known you to be "off" on the law.
but I'm concerned, Sheila, because now you are "off" on the law.
how so?
the basis of our claim lies in employment discrimination.
massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 151 - you drafted the complaint, Sheila.
we must, as a matter of law, make a showing that you're handicapped within the meaning of the statute.
we will need a doctor to testify that you have a mental illness, because you do.
and if we cannot make a showing, that you're mentally ill, we cannot win this lawsuit.
what are your thoughts?
talk to me.
please don't abandon me, Alan.
I won't.
I was initially diagnosed with schizophrenia.
I had excellent pre-morbid functioning.
I was later re-diagnosed with a non-bizarre delusional disorder -
delusional, and not schizophrenic because the voices were within my head and not from external sources.
I was treated with anti-psychotic medication, the voices remitted.
I went off the medication, and . . .
she came back.
there you have it.
I'll make the doctors available to you, though I haven't been treated in over two months.
I'll let you get back to your opening.
I need you to win this case for me.
can you win it for me, please.
done.
we know you love your dad very much, and he loves you.
we're his lawyers, and all of his secrets are safe with us.
are you the person who poisoned your mother?
I told you I don't really want to talk about it right now.
Emma, I don't think you really want your dad to live the rest of his life in prison.
there may be a way for us to help him and to protect you at the same time, but we need to know the truth, Emma.
did you poison your mother?
can you tell us why?
she was ruining everything.
she's lying to protect me.
I don't think so.
where is she?
she's with Tara. Listen . . .
I killed Molly, all right?
Emma's just trying to protect me, leave it at that.
Oh, so now you're suddenly saying that you did it?
you've been protecting your daughter.
this doesn't help her.
she's 10.
she'll be destroyed.
she'll most definitely be destroyed if she's locked up.
that doesn't have to happen.
there's probably an insanity defense -
she's 10.
Plus, for God's sake, if she's ever to have any chance of psychological or emotional health, she's going to need you on the outside.
you accepting guilt for her crime . . .
I accept guilt because I'm at fault, Ellenor.
she was raised in an environment of hatred.
her mom and I fought.
whatever caused her to do this, I absolutely accept fault.
let us try to work this out.
just make the deal on murder two.
I'll take it.
we're not allowed to do that.
as Emma's legal guardian, I am directing you to hire independent counsel for her.
that you have to do.
she's is a gifted attorney, and I mean, gifted.
she has the highest winning percentage of all our litigators.
but God speaks to her.
she claims bald men access her thoughts.
as much as we adorec Sheila Carlisle - and we do she's ill, and her delusions simply shake client confidence in our firm.
now you'll hear lots of evidence during this trial from many people documenting her illness, and you'll understand our position, but you'll truly come to appreciate it,
I'm afraid, once you hear from Sheila.
imagine being considered insane for endeavoring to communicate with God.
I've been so ostracized by my firm these days.
God was the only one who'd talk to me.
you talk to her, Margaret, every night.
and even though you think she's a he, that's okay.
and, Ward, I know you don't believe in Her, but when your wife survived cancer, you were heard to mutter, "Thank God."
wha - what is going on here?
I'm giving my opening remarks, and I'd appreciate being allowed to finish.
and this . . . is fraud.
Objection!
agnostic, Mitchell?
shame!
ms. Carlisle! Chambers - now!
just as well. Shirley has to pee.
obviously she managed to find personal data on the jurors.
this is unethical . . .
where did you get this information, Counsel?
God.
I'm not fooling around, Ms. Carlisle.
if you have access to the clerk's office - if you gained access to the files . . .
this is the probably why she relates so well to juries.
she gets inside information, which she . . .
you're absolutely right, Albert.
if you'd like a mistrial, fine.
we can do this over and over again.
my source will always be there.
all right.
regardless of where you get your information, it is improper for you to have personal contact with jurors.
I haven't.
Yes, you have.
the fact that you had it in open court doesn't change things.
this is a mistrial.
she told me that you'd do that, but I wouldn't listen.
Mr. Ginsberg.
given you don't know her source, and that she might be more subtle the next go-around,
I seriously suggest you think about settling this.
your wife would be happy.
you could take that trip to Mexico.
they're in a rut.
the cyanide came from her mother's photo lab.
evidently, it's used in developing pictures.
it explains the simple suicide note, written by a ten-year-old.
I need to talk to her.
I can't allow that.
look, you're going to have to help me out here, otherwise . . .
I'm assigned to help the girl, not you.
trust me. She's not talking.
and if I were to subpoena her?
she'll plead the Fifth - unless, of course, you'd like to grant total immunity.
well, if I can't speak to her, I have no new evidence, and therefore . . .
actually, you do.
jamie and I are witnesses, as is Tara Wilson, our assistant.
we heard the girl confess.
and I'm to take your word?
you represent the guy!
no, actually we would have to recuse ourselves now, because we've become witnesses.
look: I pull a lot of stunts.
in this trial alone, pointing the finger at the sister - it was a tactic, a part of the game.
but as an officer of the court, I am here before you now - as is Jamie - telling you, this was not a stunt.
thank you for coming in.
I understand you've had opportunity to talk to your niece.
ms. Shepard, I need you to be a friend of the court, and I . . .
hold on a second.
ms. Singleton, you represent the girl, not the aunt.
this is improper, your Honor.
well, that's my call, not yours, and I'll thank you to be quiet.
ms. Shepard, none of us wants the wrong person convicted here.
did your niece indicate to you that she poisoned your sister?
I asked you a question. I would like you to answer.
I am not going to incriminate my niece.
but I'll say, it appears Mr. Stanfield did not commit the crime.
members of the jury:
new information has come to light.
as a result of this new information, the District Attorney feels he is duty-bound to withdraw the complaint.
the charges against Bradley Stanfield are, therefore, dismissed.
the defendant is free to go.
the minor, Emma Stanfield, will be taken into custody.
and we are adjourned.
please try to be brave, sweetheart.
I will, Daddy. I will.
they're not taking you back.
what?
they can't be forced to employ you, Sheila. You know that.
well, then, let's not settle.
five is not enough.
you don't need them.
being alone is not good for me, Alan.
I need voices on the outside to balance .
being alone is not good for me.
let's not settle.
nobody's gonna hire you.
except maybe me.
you?
here?
why not?
do you even have the authority to hire people?
no. I'll figure it out.
you're a good friend, Alan.
how did you learn the identities and backgrounds of all those jurors?
you got a second?
sure.
Emma's lawyer - is she qualified?
well, she was assigned by the courts.
her reputation is good.
can you take over?
Oh, I - I suppose, but . . .
good. I wanna move quickly.
I don't want her to be locked up.
she's going to be locked up.
she committed murder. There's . . .
actually, she didn't, Jamie.
she just said she did.
all right. Look.
I'm embarrassed to say I haven't been truthful with you.
I killed Molly.
I maintained otherwise for obvious reasons - I didn't want to spend my life in jail.
as the case went south, Emma and I devised a back-up plan a Plan B of our own, I guess you'd call it.
it involved manipulating you - getting you to think that she did it, in the hope that you'd find a way to right an apparent travesty of justice - which you did, and I'm grateful.
now, we need to help her.
assuming double jeopardy will prevent me from being re-tried, one strategy might be for me to come forward now, and admit my guilt.
is that right?
do I assume correctly, Ellenor?
you killed your wife?
Yes.
and I'm not proud of using my daughter to secure my freedom.
actually, you two gave me that idea.
anyway, the mission now is to fix things, and get her out.
so, we all need to get on-board.
again, I totally apologize for manipulating you.
I thought that was the only way.
when can we proceed?
you're going to have to give us a little time to absorb all of this.
but let's not waste any time, okay?
an innocent ten-year-old girl is in jail.
we need to help her.
whatever we choose to do, by the way - it cannot involve me going to jail.
that is not an option.
okay.
thank you.
I think he could be sick.
we need to figure out a way to take him down.
how?
there's double jeopardy, privilege . . .
Jamie, he just used us as puppets to defraud the court.
we need to take him down.
assuming you do hear God's thoughts, persuading a jury of that reality will be difficult for me.
I had the highest winning percentage of any litigator in my firm
they had no right to fire me.
you can't be willing to take this to trial.
Oh, but we can.
she was terminated for a disability. That's against the law.
she will be publicly revealed as a loon.
which you are, Sheila!
listen, I need to meet with your doctors tomorrow.
I have no doctors.
you're not being treated by anybody?
why should I be?
because God speaks to me?
we will need a doctor to testify that you have a mental illness, because you do.
please don't abandon me, Alan.
I won't.
being alone is not good for me
let's not settle.
nobody's gonna hire you.
except maybe me.
do you even have the authority to hire people?
no. I'll figure it out.
to the world and to the potential jury pool, you are the man who murdered his pregnant wife and unborn son.
I need you to start demonstrating the zeal that comes with defending an innocent man.
daddy!
Hey, baby!
do you think your mom killed herself?
I know my dad didn't kill her.
he loved her.
so I think she must have committed suicide.
you stated to the police that you didn't learn of your wife's affair until after her death.
and the night before, you were heard screaming,"Do you love him?"
as I said before, I don't remember saying that.
I would like to explore murder two.
that is a life sentence, Ellenor!
I - I don't know what to tell you. We are dead.
daddy, let me tell!
Emma, please. Be quiet.
daddy, you said you... -Emma...
did your niece indicate to you that she poisoned your sister?
it appears Mr. Stanfield did not commit the crime.
the District Attorney feels he is duty-bound to withdraw the complaint.
the charges against Bradley Stanfield are, therefore, dismissed.
I killed Molly.
as the case went south, Emma and I devised a back-up plan
it involved manipulating you -
getting you to think that she did it,
now, we need to help her.
you killed your wife?
Yes.
and I'm not proud of using my daughter to secure my freedom.
the mission now is to fix things, and get her out.
so, we all need to get on-board.
there's nothing you can do.
I can't accept that, Eugene.
well, you have to.
I am sorry, there are... - She's ten years old!
listen to me! Both of you!
we represent him, not her.
she arguably thought I was her attorney when she confessed.
falsely confessed
Ellenor, all you can do is ask the client to cure his perjury.
if he refuses... - Sheila works here?
what?
that cuckoo bird?
the woman who talks to God. She works here?
no. She doesn't work here.
well, she thinks she does.
she says Alan Shore hired her.
she's out there organizing her desk.
excuse me.
did you hire her?
I don't have the authority to hire her, Eugene.
she's here. Look at her.
Yes. I said, "Come practice law with us on a temporary basis," and...
you were temporary.
she's totally nuts.
thank you, Jimmy.
I never figured you for the type who liked to weigh in.
what's that supposed to mean? -Undo this.
he just called me fat.
first of all, I would never say that.
second, you are fat. And third, you should...
we are not hiring. And if we were hiring, we would not be hiring her.
I've got to keep this woman close to me until I can persuade her to get back on her medication.
the best means for that is to employ her.
trust me.
when she functions as a lawyer, her insanity is displaced by legal acuity.
as I said, it's only temporary, and I will watch her. Please.
sync: Vine
so she works here?
temporarily. She, like Mr. Shore, will work here on a trial basis.
she will not draw a salary, and most importantly, we are not to give her clients. Ever.
then why is she here?
I'm sorry. Do paralegals speak at staff meetings?
that's not acriticism, Tara, I'm just trying to get a sense of policy.
you know what...
keep it personal now.
Hello, all.
sorry I'm late. Eugene, I was wondering if we could start at 9: 15.
I have my Feldenkrais appointments at 8, and they're murder to reschedule.
did I miss the breathing?
they don't breathe here, Sheila.
what?
miss Carlisle, we're running late...
every day should begin with ten deep breaths.
it oxygenates the brain, which gives you clarity and optimism, which is the greatest source of energy.
let's hold hands.
let's go.
everybody.
here we go.
let's suck in life's juice deep into the diaphragm.
in.
Jamie, let's go.
in.
let's go see Brad Stanfield; take our best shot.
Yeah, like that'll work.
uh, may I help you?
Yes. I'm Roland Huff, and I'd like to meet with an attorney.
do you have an appointment?
it's temporary, Jimmy.
it doesn't matter. She's a loon. -No, I'm afraid not.
okay, Roland, if you wouldn't mind taking a seat,
I'll be with you in a moment.
thank you.
you're smart enough to know, whatever your reality is, Sheila, it's folly . . .
to impose it on others.
got it. Give me a criminal.
I'm sorry?
I'm not asking for a murderer - just give me somebody clever. Give me an embezzler.
I'm an embezzler. We'll get lunch.
Sheila, it's important at the beginning that you keep a low profile here.
these people are very reticent.
just give me a case to work on.
I don't like to be alone with my thoughts.
confess?
well, wasn't that your plan anyway?
you can't be re-tried; you're free.
why not save Emma?
well, I could be prosecuted for perjury, Ellenor.
I did testify that I didn't do it, remember?
if I was to come forward now and say that I was the killer...
certainly, you're not going to allow your daughter to stay locked up.
my thinking was: Let's see how Emma's trial goes.
she probably has a legitimate temporary insanity defense.
ten years old?
she figures to be very sympathetic.
you're going to let her stand trial?
I'll testify on her behalf.
I'll talk about how troubled she was.
Brad, I don't think that's going to work.
I got myself off.
now I'll get Emma off.
you keep forgetting how persuasive I can be.
in my bed. The two of 'em. I since learned, it's been going on for six years.
how long have you been married?
seven.
Roland, Massachusetts is a "no-fault"state, which basically means that your wife's infidelity is a non-issue.
that's what I've been told, but this was...
she didn't just cheat on me, Miss Wilson;
she - she did so with my best friend!
he was... he was best man at our wedding.
it just seems so wrong.
I have two young kids.
for me to come home and find out my wife ... my children's mother?
... To learn it's been going on for six years?
Roland, it is horrible what your wife has done, but unfortunately, in a "no-fault" state, you have no remedy at law for which...
I'll represent you, Roland.
and I don't think we should just file claim against her,
I think we should prosecute that best man, as well.
I want you to continue giving the facts to... Tara, and after that, we'll file a claim in Superior Court.
we can expect a motion to dismiss;
but surviving that, discovery should be short, and we'll be in court in three months.
and we can win?
Roland, look at me.
there's a reason you happened to walk into this law office after all those other lawyers turned you down.
I win my cases.
not some of them, not most of them - every single one of them.
and I shall win this case.
I realize that I'm only a third-year law student, but . . .
even I know that public policy won't let you litigate domestic disputes.
you need to appreciate on a deeper level that you are only a third-year law student.
you see, every law can be bent, folded or manipulated, so long as it conforms to fairness.
so, instead of taking issue, perhaps you would like to seize the opportunity to learn.
you see, Tara, I will win.
aren't you just fascinated to see how?
all you need is one more drink, and we're havin' a pool party.
I'm not that drunk.
we can fix that right up.
although I did see you sort of stumble out of the cab.
not that I don't welcome you to stumble on over whenever you feel the urge.
what are you doin" here?
you know, I have freed murderers, rapists, and I usually end up sleeping at night because I know my role in the system.
you know, I'm the defense attorney up against the police state and all.
I sleep.
I never have trouble sleeping.
But?
how do I let a ten-year-old girl spend her life in juvenile hall, when I know that makes me...
you know what I am, Alan?
drunk.
a monster.
if I can let a - a child...
then I have to wear the badge, that I am a monster.
this is a beautiful, blossoming girl!
she's - she's a child.
she's the future of our country.
maybe we're both going to need another drink.
you know, I'm a terrible drinker, because I never drink.
you'll stay here tonight.
Alan, I am not having sex with you.
that's hurt.
did you bring any friends?
come on. It's late. Let's get you inside.
Ellenor Frutt: I just wanted your advice.
I'm not sure that I can keep my mouth shut.
I don't want to be disbarred. Oh!
W - we're going to court now?
I filed for a temporary restraining order.
injunctive relief gets you right in.
now, I expect them to file their motion to dismiss.
I don't mind waiving notice on that, as long as...
Ah, are they going to be there?
who?
my wife, uh, and Richard.
they might.
will that be a problem?
it's hard for me to see them.
I... don't know if I'm ready to see them.
I'll handle things.
you just stand there, and look as sad as you can.
I said, no clients.
I couldn't stop her.
you should've come and got me!
and you - you said you'd be watching her!
she already filed a complaint.
Yes, and she thinks that she's gonna win. She even...
ho - ho - hold on a second. She said that? She thinks she'll win?
Yes.
what's the problem?
if Sheila says she's going to win, she wins. No exceptions.
did you hear the cause of action?
I don't care what the cause is.
if she promises victory, you've won.
Tara, come with us. You need to learn.
don't talk to me. Ever.
if you have something to say, just put it in a note.
just a guess, but I'd say she got looped and fell in the pool.
I want you in court, backing Sheila, now.
I've got an appointment.
Tara'll be there. Eugene, she doesn't need help.
not in that room.
this is a domestic dispute.
we're in a " no-fault " state.
this is a rift between a husband and wife.
your Honor, he's telling you things you already know.
I'd ask that he respect the robe and value your time.
you're the one taking my time, Counsel, with this untenable claim.
the restatement of torts recognizes a valid claim against one who by extreme and outrageous conduct intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to another.
there is no immunity for married people.
no exception for domestic disputes.
your Honor, the court of law is a hallowed forum to litigate serious legal-judicial disputes.
Oh, yes - the "Hallowed Forum" Defense.
oprah was sued for criticizing meat.
mcdonald's was sued and lost for serving coffee that was too hot.
the "Hallowed Forum" entertains any claim that is valid, as is the one that is before you today.
all right.
the TRO nonsense is dismissed.
on the underlying claim, I want to hear from Mr. Huff.
your Honor!
you're asking me to throw this out, Counsel.
I want to conduct a short evidentiary hearing before I do so.
two o'clock.
well, progress.
breathe life's juice;
don't let it go.
he didn't tell me about you.
well, maybe he didn't even know I'd be coming.
maybe he thought it would be Ellenor or Jamie who I work with.
I know about the little plan, and may I say I admire you?
what a wonderful daughter you must be to protect your dad like this.
you're a true hero.
but now, in preparation for your dad to protect you, we have to get our statements exactly right to protect you both against perjury.
so, here's your dad's statement, and I need you to look it over, and tell me how it's going to compare to yours.
did you trick this girl?
I persuaded her to tell the truth.
I might have used a little trickery.
and this is my statement.
it's hearsay, since Mr. Stanfield didn't confess to me directly, but I think you'll find that...
hold on just a second, would you, please?
this would be privileged.
y - you're a member of Miss Frutt's firm?
anything she told you...
I haven't even gotten to the good part.
since Mr. Stanfield accomplished his mistrial through fraud, double jeopardy does not attach.
you can try him all over again on double murder, and this time, you'll have my testimony.
Mr. Shore, I will give you the opportunity to take this all back because...
it's not going to happen.
I have no choice but to report you to the bar.
that's fine. But you will use this.
you'll probably lose your license.
I've always wanted to farm apples.
Cortlands, not Macintosh - they make for a much tarter crisp.
there's a little girl in a juvenile facility, Mr. Campbell.
send for her, then send for Mr. Stanfield.
then you can have the bar send for me.
in a stunning development, we've now learned Brad Stanfield has been re-arrested for the murder of his wife and unborn son.
sources say Mr. Stanfield's own lawyers provided information leading to the arrest.
I did nothing. I swear.
the defendant is scheduled be arraigned at two-thirty.
you may remember, earlier charges against Brad Stanfield were dismissed by the prosecution.
I didn't say anything.
Hello!
did I miss something interesting?
Alan, did you talk to the D.A. about Stanfield?
I might've mentioned he confessed.
please come to my office.
you don't really know me, Mr. Shore.
Eugene, I know you don't want me here.
and now I've given you a perfect reason to fire me.
Ellenor would certainly understand.
I would appreciate the courtesy of my discharge being a reflective decision, however.
so, if you could at least wait until your anger subsides, I'd be grateful.
he's not looking well at all.
what's going on, Roland?
I wasn't prepared for seeing them like that.
how it'd make me feel.
I don't know if I can testify in some big public thing. I - I don't know.
take my hand, Roland.
I - I just don't like the way I'm feeling now.
why don't you just speak directly to me.
tell me your story. Pretend I'm the only one in the room.
seeing the two of them sitting together like that.
I'll tell you what.
you just look at me. Tell me your story.
I think the worst part was, I thought everything was wonderful.
were you two having sexual relations?
no. 'Cause she...
Roland? Look at me, please.
she said she couldn't have sex because she had a fibroid condition, and I accepted it.
how did you learn of your wife's affair with Mr. Ward?
came home from work early one day;
tried to surprise her.
I had a plan - I was going to take her out to dinner.
and when I got home, I saw Richard's car parked out in front.
I didn't think anything of it. He comes over all the time.
he's my best friend.
I figured he came over to borrow something.
I went in and I heard music coming from upstairs.
actually, it was my very, very favorite song: Peppermint Twist.
and so, I headed up.
other sounds got louder as I got closer and when I went in, I saw 'em -
richard and my wife were having intercourse in my house, in my bed.
and then what happened?
well, they looked at me, they stopped, and they started up again.
right there, with you in the room.
Yes. Yes.
they didn't even have the decency to stop.
anything said to Mr. Shore by the other lawyers would be an extension of privilege.
this was not state action, your Honor.
any breach committed by Mr. Shore is actionable against Mr. Shore civilly.
we should not, however, be banned from using the information.
this would violate every principle of fairness for my client to be re-tried.
counsel, if this information is true, your client conspired to let his ten-year-old daughter take the fall for a double murder he committed.
I don't think you mean to play the fairness card.
I see Attorneys Frutt and Stringer.
I'll see you and counsel in chambers - now. Mr. Stanfield, you'll stay in custody.
does Mr. Shore report the facts correctly?
privilege prevents me from either confirming or denying Mr. Shore's allegations.
ms. Frutt, we have a serious problem here.
if that little girl took the stand and decided on her own to lie, then double jeopardy attaches, and Mr. Stanfield goes free.
if he conspired to commit the fraud, however, double jeopardy does not attach, and he can be re-tried.
we understand that, your Honor, but...
you stepped outside your role as advocates, and stood before me as officers of the court!
which we deeply regret.
I am not interested in remorse.
your Honor...
I'm not speaking to you, Mr.King.
without asking you to reveal privilege, I would like you to either confirm or deny to me what you said to me as officers of the court.
all I will say:
we believed our representations to be true.
whether we continue to believe them to be true, privilege prevents us from saying.
Mr. King, it is my finding: the mistrial was procured by fraud.
double jeopardy will, therefore, not attach.
your client will be re-tried.
Mr. Campbell, get the girl out of jail.
ms. Frutt, tell Mr. Shore that I am recommending him for immediate disbarment.
why does she get to testify?
I mean, why - why does she get to tell her story?
it's a good sign that the judge wants to hear from her, Roland.
it means they're considering our case.
you know, I don't even know if I want to do this anymore.
I thought it would make me feel better, but it's only makin" me feel worse.
I - I'm getting very angry feelings, and I don't like it when I feel this way!
big breath, just...
I don't want to suck life's juice.
Roland, I think that you wanted to do this because you felt victimized.
and that could be what's been making you feel angry.
now, you can certainly quit now, but it might end up making you feel even more angry.
Alan? You betrayed me.
did I? Sorry.
don't be flip.
I came to you in distress, in confidence, because I had a problem that I...
which I shared.
you couldn't live with a child being falsely imprisoned; neither could I.
you should have come to me.
in which case, you might be facing disbarment.
perhaps you could say, "Thanks for the insulation."
but you didn't insulate her.
what you did goes to this firm - our reputation, and it's damaged.
you're right, Jimmy.
I'm sorry. How "bout a hug?
I'm gonna pop this guy, I swear. I'm just gonna hit him. -Aw, stop this, guys. This is serious.
what time's the hearing before the Bar?
ten A.M.
have you retained counsel?
I'll represent myself.
and what are you going to say?
exactly what I feel at the moment.
your conduct speaks to the integrity of this firm.
you need to "get" that.
got it.
I'm not proud of it, but I fell in love.
it happens, sometimes, in marriage. People have affairs.
I'm sorry I hurt Roland, and, of course, my children, but I fell in love.
but when Roland came into the room, did you really continue to have relations?
you know, I don't really don't believe we did, but...
this is embarrassing to talk about, but when you're about to climax, you're not completely in control of your faculties.
all I can say...I never meant to hurt Roland.
he's a dear man. I love him.I just...
fell in love.
quickly, I might add.
after about a year of being married to this man, . . .
...having children, you were having an affair with his best friend.
Yes.
best friend?
Yes.
why not get a divorce?
why have children, if you were in love with somebody else?
that was probably not a wise decision, but...
you made it when you were about to climax.
Objection!
getting a divorce would have cost you a lot of money, right, Nance?
roland had lots; you had none, and the best man was unemployed.
this was never about money.
no, simply love, just all about love.
tell me something, Nance, how did you not get caught for six years?
Wow! Six years - that's a really long time to pull off a lie.
Objection!
six years. She screwed his best friend in his bed.
Objection!
your Honor, why are you not ruling on my objections?
Oh, all right. Sustained.
dial it back, Ms. Carlisle.
people fall in love, Nancy.
I "get" that.
fall victim to passion.
but this?
this was six years of careful planning to avoid detection.
this was reflective, orchestrated, premeditated deceit.
don't you dare clump that under the banner of love!
this was evil.
you are an evil person.
objection.
your Honor, God would like to apologize to the court.
she says she's terribly over-extended, and sometimes, when she's spread too thin, people like Nancy happen.
he wants to see me?
and only you.
what's going on?
Brad Stanfield asked to see me.
you...you can't. I mean, he's represented by counsel, and...
well, he waived it.
Sheila, Judge Brown's office called. She's ruling at ten.
okay.
how's she doing?
fabulous.
only she got a little religious at the end of her cross.
I couldn't tell.
the problem with this lawsuit:
every husband will start suing his ex-wife as a way to circumvent alimony.
we may get to the point where husbands even entrap their wives into having affairs, so they can avoid losing their houses.
this is why we have " no-fault,"
why the court doesn't even want to go there, asking who's to blame.
however, divorce law should not be used to shield a person when he engages in egregious, outrageous conduct to the emotional detriment of others.
six years with his best friend?
ms. Huff!
I'm sorry.
a jury might throw this out, but I won't.
the motion to dismiss is denied.
I don't believe it.
we've got a long way to go.
we have three months minimum on discovery, you've got to decide if you want to settle, but the leverage is ours, Roland.
you think you've won, Roland.
you're represented by counsel, Ms...
I don't care. Drop this now, Roland, or you'll lose the kids.
I don't think that's your call, Nance.
you think you know everything?
certainly not; just a little more than most.
little news flash, Roland: The kids aren't yours. They're Richard's.
what?
Yeah. So drop this case, Roland, or you'll never see "em again.
it wasn't a master plan, Roland.
it - it just happened.
didn't you even wonder why they don't look like you?
not even slightly.
all right. Talk time's over.
you're not looking so smug anymore.
come on, Richard.
all right.
I want you to drop by the office, Roland, and we will figure out your legal options.
Tara, Want you to do some research.
done.
ROLAND: Look at me.
I told you in the beginning, I'd take care of you, and I will.
you turned in your own client?
I did.
do you have any defense?
no.
that's all you have to say to us? No?
well, I thought if I save time, you might go easier.
Mr.Shore, if you find this amusing...
I find it preposterous, your Honor.
a ten-year-old girl climbs into the witness chair to declare herself the killer - the daughter of the defendant.
what happens? The judge says mistrial.
the child goes to jail and the only thing horrifying you is that I revealed the double murderer's secret.
Yes, Mr.Shore. Because privilege...
privilege is fundamental to the system.
problem is, Judge, the system is a disaster.
we have over ten thousand wrongful convictions...
you're not helping yourself.
and who might you be helping, Judge?
your Honor?
may I be heard?
who are you?
my name is Eugene Young.
Mr. Shore is a member of our firm, and as such, I believe I have standing to address this tribunal.
Mr. Shore was doing so well without you.
I, like this tribunal, believe lawyer-client privilege to be sacrosanct, and that there could be no greater violation to this process than the breach of that trust.
but your Honors, in order for there to be a breach, there has to be an underlying trust to begin with.
here there wasn't.
Brad Stanfield lied to Ellenor Frutt and Jamie Stringer.
he deceived them for the express purpose of defrauding the court.
the fact that they couldn't trust him doesn't mean that he wasn't trusting them.
well, I would submit a fiduciary relationship has to be somewhat mutual.
beyond that, Alan Shore had the legal right to reveal Mr.Stanfield's secret.
and how do you get that?
well, directing the court's attention to the rules of professional conduct.
rule Number One Point Six B One.
in one state in this country, a lawyer may break client privilege to prevent the wrongful incarceration of another.
that state is Massachusetts.
Mr. Young, that is an obscure exception, which to my knowledge has never been relied upon ever...
but, it's there. It is written.
the fact that Mr. Shore's the first to invoke it does not undermine its validity.
technically, Alan Shore acted legally.
and moreover, your Honor, he acted morally.
he did the right thing.
the three of you speak of prioritizing trust.
wh - what about the public trust in our profession?
what about the erosion of respect for who and what we are?
alan Shore is an honorable man.
he saw an unspeakable wrong - a child imprisoned for something she didn't commit - and he acted to right it.
he acted within both the technical bounds of the law and the moral bounds of decency.
accordingly, he should neither be suspended nor expelled from practice, because he is just.
he is just.
and your Honors, you need to reach into yourselves like Alan Shore did, and do what is right.
sure the whole town's applauding for you right now.
probably want to buy you a - a gold watch or something like that.
I didn't rat you out, Brad.
neither did Jamie.
it was another lawyer in our firm.
are you tellin'me you had nothing to do with this?
Oh, I would love to claim I did.
I wish I had the courage to throw away my career, but somebody else did the dirty work for me.
you're a fan of dirty work, aren't you?
I'm glad you're enjoying this.
I am.
but you need to remember two things, Ellenor.
first, I will walk away from the second trial, just like I walked away from the first.
because you make such a favorable impression. People like you.
and second, when I do walk away, I'll be looking you up.
is that a threat?
of course not!
I don't believe you had nothing to do with this, Ellenor.
I'm in here now, but I won't be for long.
keep talking. I am free to repeat it all.
we're in each other's lives, Ellenor.
and the story's just beginning.
we've done some research, and it's not the end of the world.
don't handle me!
even if they're not your biological children, they are still yours.
any child born into a marriage is presumed . . .
I wanna hurt her now.
Roland, I need you to listen to me.
she can't take away your kids.
even if they are Richard's biologically, legally we still think that they're yours.
there are estoppel arguments to be made against Richard, and under current adoption laws...Is he listening to me?
I don't think he's listening to me.
we're going to win this lawsuit, Roland.
we're going to try to get you full custody.
this is going to backfire on them.
promise me that. Please, promise.
we can't promise, Roland, but...
Yes, we can.
I promise, Roland.
I'll win this for you.
we are not persuaded that Mr.Shore did the moral thing when he blatantly broke privilege.
we don't think that he was just at all when he betrayed his own client.
Mr. Shore, in our view, you have offended the very essence of what it means to be a criminal defense attorney, but, technically, under Rule One Point Six B One, a rule which you probably weren't aware of .
...were you?
Absolutely. I read it twice.
under this obscure provision, which will undoubtedly be erased now that someone has actually invoked it, you're covered.
we don't have the grounds to suspend you, however much we might like to.
we deeply hope that you will give us another chance soon.
we're adjourned.
what do you know?
Eugene, thank you.
I did it for the firm.
don't mistake it for affection.
Yes. Thank you.
what's going on? Are you all right?
bedroom. I think I need a lawyer.
bedroom?
I need a lawyer.
I need help.
let's go. Come on.
Mary, Mother of God.
our Father Who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy Name.
thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done.
lead us not into temptation.
deliver us from evil.
for Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory, forever.
Amen.
mom!
Wilden was obsessed with trying to pin Alison's murder on my friends.
Mona made a full confession.
did you girls put her up to this?
thinking it would somehow help Ashley?
what makes you so sure that she didn't do it?
things she said in her confession contradict some of the evidence.
you weren't listed as his father on his birth certificate.
I don't... have any rights?
not until you establish paternity.
we have to face facts.
3000 miles is a long way.
we're not gonna be together next year.
Dr. Palmer said to watch out for the blonde girl.
any chance that he meant Cece?
you can't leave the house unless it's for a court date or a medical appointment?
that... tracks where I am. - Oh, my God!
did somebody push her in?
think somebody hit her first.
feel safe when I'm with you.
I still think we should dip into those candy-striper outfits one more time.
what difference would that have made?
well, we could've talked to Jenna instead of getting turned away at the visitor's desk.
guys! Can you keep it down, please?
whole point was to sneak back.
I think Mr. Facinelli noticed that our entire row was missing.
Well...I'd still like to graduate.
Oh, news flash...
honey, none of us are graduating.
okay, I still think that Spencer to get back to Shana and see if she'll say more.
what? Why? - Because...!
if Cece drowned Jenna, then she must know the reason.
and why exactly do we trust Shana?
all right, well I don't trust anybody, and you guys are about as quiet as a monster truck rally. Now shut up.
fine. I'm going to the source.
the source"?
Cece's been A. W.O. L.Since Wilden was alive.
you're not just gonna find her folding peasant skirts at the diva dish right now.
well, then I'll... I'll search every hipster boutique until I do find her.
no friggin' way.
what? What's wrong? - Is it an "A" text?
worse. It's my mother.
Mrs. DiLaurentis has offered to let us stay with her.
in Ali's house?
you're gonna sleep in Ali's old bed?
No! Hell no. I'm not moving in there.
Yes, you are.
em, you have to.
it might be our best chance to find Cece.
you could've been a little more sensitive. She's homeless right now, and you just convinced her to stay in our dead friends' room.
Yeah, well our friend is close with Cece.
maybe there's something there that can help us track her down.
that room is freaky.
Ali's mom turned it into a shrine.
Kay, you wanna talk about "freaky"?
look at the guy who hangs out at the ice machine at Emily's motel.
he crushes ice with his armpit.
she should just ask her mom if she can come stay with us.
I don't think my mom's taking any guests at the moment.
she's having a hard enough time getting dressed in the morning.
would a guest be a good distraction?
as much as she loves Emily, I don't think she wants to cry in front of her.
let's talk later, okay? - Okay.
Hey. Do you want me to give that a try?
actually picked a few locks in my time.
no. No, thanks.
I-I'll just go back down to the janitor's office.
was hoping to avoid that.
second time I've done this today.
Mr. Fitz?
yeah?
here.
thank you. - Yeah.
so does that forwarding address belong to Cece?
I'm... I'm not sure yet.
how are you not sure?
it's a box at the post office, Hanna.
she's not gonna jump out like a girl in a birthday cake and yell,"boo.
so what did you find?
I tracked down an unpaid cable bill that was sent to that P. O. Box.
how'd you do that?
do you really wanna know?
I mean, it's gonna involve me talking about firewalls and code.
okay, no. I don't.
that cable bill is attached to a physical address in Philly.
where Cece may or may not be watching SportsCenter right now?
it's a long shot, but it's worth a try.
these action shots are sick.
you made me look like I know what I'm doing.
this one's my favorite.
Thanks.
thank you.
I wish I could use one of these for the match tonight.
the picture I gave 'em was so old, I look...
like an altar boy.
what... what match tonight?
it's no big deal.
um, it's a fight that requires a headshot.
it sounds like a pretty big deal to me.
it's regional championships.
well...
it makes it sound like it's impressive, which it's not.
it's a bunch of fold-out chairs and a gym that smells like feet.
no, I love it. Can I come?
it's taking a train to Philly to watch guys make zoolander faces at each other.
you... You really wanna go?
well, are you gonna be there?
Yeah.
then yes, I wanna go.
Mona, would you please tell me your emotional response to this picture?
it's a family on a farm.
the sun is shining and they're smiling.
it's a happy picture.
so, how does that make you feel?
happy.
what's your response?
tell your artist to take a class, because this looks like Norman Rockwell sketched it with his teeth.
that's not a feeling. That's an opinion.
I'd like to know how you feel.
about farm animals? - About what you say you've done.
look, those girls... Used to make me feel bad.
but recently, I realized that...
we're on the same side.
I wanted to make up for all the things I'd done.
Wilden was bothering them, so I got rid of him.
and I'd do it again.
I don't think you got rid of anybody.
that's my response.
let's take a break.
like you to think about whether you're gonna be honest with me.
why would I ever be honest with you?
used to be.
well that was before I realized where your loyalties were.
I'm not sure what that means.
but I thought we'd done a good job of establishing a sense of trust while you've been a patient here.
that was before I realized that you were keeping secrets from me.
by the way, you forgot the "g" in "diagnosis.
you're the one who's been keeping a secret.
and you're smart enough to know I was gonna figure it out.
figure what out?
you stopped taking your medication.
I...
I-I can't stay here.
look at this. It's like a...a museum.
Ah... I know I promised Hanna, but I can't do this.
okay, Emily, just try to relax for a second.
look, when you think about it, putting back her room is really not that strange of a reaction.
I'm... I'm serious.
in the 19th century, when children died, their parents would sometimes pose them for lifelike photos as mementos.
not helping.
not helping at all.
okay, well just try to remember that this is an opportunity.
you know, you could find some stuff in here that could be really useful to us.
just not thrilled being here by myself.
wait, your mom's not gonna be here with you? - No.
she has a hearing with the police department disciplinary committee.
she doesn't come back from Harrisburg until tomorrow.
what about Paige?
can she come over?
we're not exactly in the best place right now.
found everything you need?
um... Yeah.
I'm sorry it's so chilly.
furnace is acting up.
I've called someone to come over and have a look at it.
can I get you girls anything?
I have those vanilla wafers that you all used to like.
um... No, thanks. I should unpack.
I'll get you some hangars.
you know, I...
I don't really wear things that need to be hung up.
there are fresh towels in the linen closet, and...
I made extra keys.
I really want you to make yourself at home here, Emily.
I know that you and your mom have been through a lot.
Thanks, Mrs. D.
it's so nice to see you girls back in this room.
it's like you never left.
Hey. - Hey.
Oh, I thought you and carbs weren't friends anymore.
we're not. It's for my mom.
she hasn't really eaten anything today.
where is she?
shut up in her room.
if it wasn't for the phone calls from Mrs. Hastings, she probably wouldn't even get out of bed.
well, then, do you wanna go check out this address in Philly?
I mean, there's a train that leaves in, like, 40...
actually, uh, Aria's gonna do that.
she's already gonna be out there. So...
um, I was wondering if...
maybe you'd help me get into Radley.
why would you wanna do that?
this wouldn't happen to have anything to do with the fact that Mona has been moved there, would it?
she's the only person who Cece's reached out to.
they're doing a psych evaluation for a reason, Hanna.
Mona is helping my mom. She's...
no, first, "A" used a sedan as a wrecking ball on Emily's house.
and then Jenna shows up in a lake looking like soggy bread, and now you wanna go to Radley and ring the bell jar?
so you're not coming with me?
Hanna, listen to yourself, okay?
you are so desperate that you're willing to go to the enemy for help.
Mona is not the enemy anymore.
you don't know that for sure.
Hanna, I think it's time that you went to your parents and the cops, and you told them that "A" is back.
no.
no. There's no way I'm doing that! Telling them will only make it worse.
it can't get any worse.
God, just...
give me some time to think this over.
I'm gonna take this to my mom.
Hey!
Hi.
how have you been?
sorry. Stupid question.
I'm a little fuzzy. I've been working 72 hours straight, and this is my first break.
Yeah. The nurse told me.
Oh, so this isn't us running into each other so much as... - I hunted you down.
well, then. How can I help you?
if you could just please let me in to see Mona...
Hanna... - I don't even have to see her.
I just wanna talk to her. - Hanna, you know I can't.
in fact, given your mother's situation, I probably shouldn't be talking to you.
but it's not about Mona.
I'm just wondering about Cece.
has she contacted you?
or... - why would Cece contact me?
Spencer said that you let her in once before to see Mona, and I was wondering if she thought that you would... do it again.
what's wrong?
no, nothing.
it's just the nurse said someone tried to see Mona last night, and when she described a young blonde, I thought it was probably you.
it wasn't.
did she get in to see her?
no, she was turned away.
well then why are you so worried?
between you and me, ever since our budget was cut, the hospital's been a little short-staffed.
what are you saying? - I'm saying things have been missed. That's all.
okay, well you have security cameras, right?
I mean... uh...
can't you see if it was her, right?
Hanna, I don't want to get involved. - Please.
please do this for me. It's important.
I'll see what I can do.
thank you.
Hi. We have a problem.
I'll take care of my end.
you take care of yours.
leave the lamb alone and go for the lion.
So,"A" is telling you to ditch Eddie Lamb and go for Dr. Palmer.
but what's the deal with the sheet music?
I recognized it as soon as I saw it.
you did?
my mom used to play this song all the time.
I remember her playing it.
maybe...
there's some...there's something about my mom's connection to the music that's important. - Yeah.
something that she shared in her sessions with Dr. Palmer.
will you come with me to see him?
Why?
I mean, you don't... you don't need me.
you've already met him once before.
because you're the only person that I can talk to about this.
okay, well what do you want me to tell Emily?
cause I promised her that I'd go back to that house...
you can't... you can't tell her anything.
if you do, the faucet turns off, and "A" isn't going to give me anything else.
and when does this end?
what do you mean?
I mean how much longer do you need me to keep this a secret?
until I find out what happened...
what really happened to her.
looking for something, dear?
Yeah, I...
I was just gonna go and get something to eat.
well let me make you something. Have a seat.
just pass that stuff out of the way.
my husband has decided to divorce me.
I'm fine, really. I'm just...
dealing with the initial shock of it.
open it.
what is it? - Open it.
don't be afraid. You already know the truth.
I'm the one that's... Late to the party.
what are you talking about?
I saw a lawyer to start the process of getting my name - put on Malcolm's birth certificate. - Ezra, how could you do that?
I didn't want you to take my son away from me. - I can't believe that you would go behind my back.
Oh, what do you care?
this doesn't amount to much more than shadow boxing.
does it?
you knew I wasn't his father.
um, I thought you were helping your mom the rest of the day.
I am. I just went to go drop some papers off at Spencer's mom's office.
Caleb, what were you doing going into Veronica's office building?
I don't know how to protect you anymore.
so you were gonna tell her?!
you were actually gonna tell her?! - Yes, I was.
okay, I would rather you hate me and be safe than the other way around.
and you think telling her about "A" is gonna keep me safe?
at the end of the day, she can do a lot more for you than I can.
you know, if some punk comes up to you in the street, I'm gonna do whatever I can to lay him out.
but this enemy...
this enemy is everywhere and... and nowhere at the same time.
I keep...
I keep taking swings in the dark, and I'm missing.
I'm just... I'm not enough to keep you safe anymore.
Yes, you are.
just tell him to push back the meeting a half-hour.
I had to pick up files from home.
Thanks, Anya.
Bye.
now what can I do for you?
look, I know my history with the Hastings has been a bit... Rocky.
I'm not going to debate that.
but regardless of whether you like me...
like you?
you broke my daughter's heart and took every piece of goodwill this family extended to you and flushed it down the toilet.
why are you here, Wren?
I'm here to warn you...
about Mona.
I don't know why she's confessed to this murder, but... you should be careful.
let me explain something to you.
I'm a defense attorney. I don't care why Mona's confessed.
whether she did it or not, she's helped my case by giving me an alternate explanation for the crime.
so... - and she may have done.
but she's going to turn the tables on you.
she's a dangerous person.
and she hasn't forgiven your daughter or her friends, despite what she says.
she wants to see them hurt, as well as the people closest to them...
like Ashley Marin.
you know you could lose your medical license for telling me this?
she's still your patient, isn't she?
she is.
but if I hadn't made such a mess of things...
you were once going to be my family.
we'd been fighting a lot...
over dumb stuff.
and you were gonna be leaving for school at the end of summer...
so... what? It's my fault?
no.
I was mad at you.
I went to a party with some friends, had too much to drink...
I made a mistake.
so what are you trying to say?
that you... Didn't know?
you may have been confused then, but you haven't been confused for seven years, Maggie. - I knew it was a question.
but I decided to answer it myself, and I gave myself the answer that I wanted.
no, I-I can't feel bad for you right now. I won't.
I'm not asking you to.
you let me believe he was my child.
I've taken him to the movies, to baseball games.
I've helped him with his homework.
we...we have inside jokes.
I know that he...he hates too much milk in his cereal.
and I know the names of every single one of his stuffed animals.
and I know exactly which one he needs when he wakes up in the middle of the night.
you made me believe he's my...he's my child.
I'm sorry.
you let me fall in love with him.
I'm sorry.
I-I really am.
okay, well, if I don't get back soon, he's gonna think that it's weird.
I mean, gone with the wind took less time than this fro-yo run.
trust me, Jake will still be kicking when you get back. - Fine.
Oh, but can you please check in on Emily and see how she's doing?
Spencer said she was pretty creeped-out when she left.
Yeah. Sure. - Thanks. I'll talk to you later.
Oh! Excuse me. Sorry.
you from the management company?
I'm here to... - because I told the lady on the phone
I'll move out, but as far as...
no, no... I'm here looking for someone named Cece Drake.
well if you find her, let me know.
we grieved differently.
Ken boxed up all of Ali's things and put the house on the market, and I...
felt her presence everywhere.
I even started seeing her.
what do you mean?
I was jogging in the park and I saw this young woman ahead of me.
it was Ali.
I could've sworn.
the hair, the walk... it was her.
I started running after her.
I practically tackled that poor girl.
so it wasn't Ali?
I lose a piece of her every day.
that's why I did the room.
if it were up to Ken, he'd just lock that bedroom door and throw away the key.
you think you know somebody so well, but then...
something that you both counted on changes, and...
you find out who they really are.
just wish it hadn't taken me 24 years to learn that.
I don't expect you to understand.
no, I do.
I'm going through it, myself.
someone I'm dating.
we're becoming different people, but...
keep trying to ignore that.
well what does he think?
actually, I...
I-I wasn't sure if you knew, but I guess not.
I'm with a girl.
I realized that's who I want to be with, and that's who I am.
I'm very proud of you, Emily.
Mrs. DiLaurentis, I want you to know that you're not the only one who's seen Ali.
I have, too.
of course you have.
you loved her as much as I did.
I wish that Ali could've returned those feelings.
I couldn't have asked for a better person to love her than you.
when Cece dropped out of UPenn and left for L. A.she was still paying rent.
at least, I thought she was.
she dropped out, or...
she was kicked out?
how'd you know about that?
I thought you said you weren't really "girls" with Cece.
uh, I wasn't, but my friend Alison was.
so you're one of Alison's friends?
you want the spot?! Move a box!
well, then you know.
I'm sorry... know what?
Alison got her kicked out.
at least, that's what Cece claimed.
uh, she could've been lying.
true, but having met Alison, I could see that chick shoving someone down the stairs.
what?
you were at that frat party.
W-which one are you?
in Alison's crew?
Cece always said there were four other she-devils.
"She-devils"?
well I-I hardly even knew Cece, and that...
party was like three years ago. I barely even remember anything.
well, it stayed pretty fresh in Cece's mind.
she assumed you were all in on it. And she hated you for it.
Hello?
Mrs. DiLaurentis?
Hello?
Mrs. DiLaurentis?
Dr. Palmer?
why, yes.
hello.
um, this is Spencer. - Hi.
it's a pleasure and I don't know if you remember me...
I'm Marion Cavanaugh's son.
that's right.
I-I came to visit you not that long ago, and we talked about my mother.
I was, uh, hoping that we could talk about her some more.
I'd be happy to talk with you about her.
can you take a look at this?
Ah, that's a good one.
Oh, unfortunately, um...
I don't play.
Hello, Mrs. Hastings.
how did you get in here?
isn't there someone at the front desk? - Yes, there is.
Oh, I guess you must've made friends with the nurses when your daughter was here.
I wanted to have a little chat with you, off the record.
may I?
Hey, Aria.
I'm, uh... Up in five.
awesome! I'll... I'll be right there.
I just... I need to take this.
why are you throwing yourself on the sword?
I get the feeling that you make a lot of people nervous.
am I right?
well you know what? So do I.
I can be pretty scary, myself.
and if I find out that you're going to use this stunt against my daughter and her friends, you'll find out just how scary.
the only person who messed with your daughter and her friends was Wilden.
and he's dead now.
okay. Have it your way, Mona.
but if you continue to screw with my family or this case, I have ways to see to it that you rot in a cell until your hair turns gray.
you understand me?
do you remember my mother talking about music?
I would be happy to talk with you about music.
you know, I adore opera in particular.
uh, sir, I'm not talking about...
Oh, Marion.
that's lovely.
is Toby coming today?
no.
no, Dr. Palmer, he's not.
well I-I-I think it would mean a lot to him to hear you play.
he's... he's heard me before.
Yes, but not since you've been here.
I think it would give him a great deal of comfort to know that you're enjoying your music once again.
don't you think he need to see that?
um, Dr. Palmer, could you tell me again about the blonde girl?
the one that I should steer clear of?
what blonde?
y-you talked to me about her. You said that she was dangerous.
Yes.
that's right.
Oh, looks like our time is up.
I will see you next session.
w-was it Cece Drake?
Dr. Palmer, was her name Cece Drake?
can you please show Mrs. DiLaurentis to my office?
he said,"DiLaurentis."I'm positive.
how can you be positive?
you said it was Toby that was there, not you.
no... it was.
Kay... what was Toby doing in an old folks' home?
I-I don't know, okay.
it had something to do with Nigel's phone.
you guys are focusing on the wrong details, okay?
she was there. Ali's mom was at Radley at some point.
he has dementia.
the name "DiLaurentis" has been everywhere.
maybe he just got it stuck in his head.
well, I think it's worth it to find out.
so what?
you're just gonna ask her?
Yeah, why not?
um, because she's going through a divorce, and she's a little fragile.
I can't talk about this anymore.
I'm late for work.
Emily, is that you?
uh, actually, Emily left for work.
Oh, and I was hoping you girls would stay for dinner.
you could even sleep over if you like.
I still have the trundle bed upstairs.
you know, it's chilly in here right now, but the furnace guy is on his way.
no, it's... um, another time.
Yeah.
Mrs. DiLaurentis, do you happen to know a Dr. Palmer?
the name rings a bell.
what kind of doctor is he?
a psychiatrist from Radley.
this is your doctor?
uh, no, no.
uh, he's retired.
I was just wondering...
I was wondering if he was yours.
why would you wonder that, dear?
because he mentioned you.
well, if it's the guy I'm thinking of, I only met him the one time.
but he wasn't my psychiatrist.
was he Ali's?
no, he wasn't.
where are you?
I'm in here. Duh.
aren't you impressed? I guess all your nagging finally paid off.
Oh, my God!
you almost took off my frickin' fingers!
you think that's funny? The stunt you pulled?
that some sort of sick joke to you? - You seriously almost took off my limbs.
is that what the two of you do when you're not braiding each other's hair?
figure out ways to scare the hell out of me?
why are you having a full-on hemorrhage?
don't you speak to me that way. - I don't even know what you're talking about!
I get a phone call this afternoon... "we have your daughter here,"they tell me.
we think she may be a danger to herself.
she wants to stay here.
so I run about three stop signs.
I'm trying to get your father on the phone.
I'm... I'm terrified that you've hurt yourself.
then I get there... she's dressed head-to-toe in your clothing, but it's not my daughter sitting in Radley.
it's Cece Drake.
I can't believe that crazy bitch actually did it.
go to your room.
go to your room, because I can't be held accountable for what happens.
I didn't even know that she was actually gonna do it.
well, you enjoy it, because it's the last game that the two of you are going to play together.
even the doctor I spoke to agreed that this friendship is toxic.
so are a lot of things.
that girl is no longer welcome in this house.
had they ever done anything like that before? - No.
but even from the beginning, something about their relationship was wrong, obsessive.
what? Like...
wearing each other's makeup?
clothes?
more like wearing each other's personalities.
that's pretty messed-up.
Yeah, but it makes sense.
remember, that guy Hector said that Ali wanted masks of her face made so that her friends would look more like her?
I thought that was a dig at us.
so did I, but apparently she was talking about Cece.
Hi.
Hi.
I wasn't sure if you'd be home for dinner.
Oh, no, I thought we could just order a pizza.
okay, sure.
honey, have you spoken to your mom lately?
uh, not since earlier. Why?
I... you should probably head home.
Mrs. Hastings, what's going on?
someone made an anonymous complaint to the court.
they're accusing me of obstruction of justice.
What?!
they're alleging that I bullied Mona into... Giving her confession.
that's crazy.
I know. And the charges won't hold water for long, but unfortunately, the damage is done.
what damage?
in order not to hurt your mother's case, I have to recuse myself.
what does that mean?
it means...
right now, your mother doesn't have a lawyer.
I didn't know it was gonna go so...
late.
it's okay.
and just so you know, my plan wasn't to brown-bag it on a stoop.
my plan was to take you somewhere nice. - Hey, it's fine.
fine. - Like steak or... or something. It...
I...Don't eat meat.
at all.
well, I'm glad I didn't do that.
what, that sauce a little too spicy for you, sport?
excuse me?
I love spicy food.
no, it's just, uh, this scratch doesn't.
gimme that. Give it to me.
Lemme see.
sorry, it's just...
so tiny I can't really see it in this light. - All right, all right.
no kidding, though...
that guy got me right in the jaw.
my mouth hurts just movin' it.
h-how is a total badass like you, who won his match tonight, acting like such a baby?
so...
think I'm a badass?
no, not at all. I think you're a faker.
you're grinning from ear to ear right now.
doesn't seem to be hurting at all.
I can't help it.
you're here with me on a stoop...
eating a vegetarian burrito.
I can't help but smile right now.
does this hurt?
try again.
how about this?
Hi, Mrs. DiLaurentis.
Hi. How was work?
fine. Fine.
what are you knitting?
what was going to be a scarf for my husband, but now I guess it'll be a tight sweater for me.
by the way, you can call me Jessica.
the circuit breaker was blown.
Ah, so, I replaced it, and it should start to warm up in here in about 20 minutes.
great. Thank you so much.
Yeah, um, I don't exactly know how to say this, but... Looks like you have a bigger problem.
you said so yourself... this isn't true.
won't this all just blow over?
the prosecution still might try to use it in the trial.
and we just can't risk that.
Oh, I need to take this.
I have to go home. I have to go see my mom. - Okay, I'll join you.
Hanna, just calm down. Everything's gonna be all right.
Kay... no it's not!
okay, an anonymous tip? Who do you think called that in?!
Hey, take a breath.
no, I have to go home.
I know. It's very upsetting.
well a real lapse in judgment.
well I was beginning to suspect the confession was coerced, but yeah I was shocked when I learned it was my former mother-in-law.
almost mother-in-law.
guess I dodged a bullet there.
well, just goes to show...you can't trust anyone.
over there.
he's right.
it definitely looks like somebody used this as their temporary home.
Oh, should we...
maybe call the police?
I'm sure they're long gone.
my guess is they moved out before Jason moved back in.
unfortunately, they left us quite a mess.
maybe I can get the gardener to clear that out.
Hey, I'm gonna heat up some lasagna.
you must be starving.
the perfect hideaway. An empty bed and breakfast.
I think we should go check it out.
you stopping?
no, I'm not doing anything. The engine stopped working.
Maggie is trying to prevent me from seeing Malcolm.
I didn't know that you wanted that.
sorry.
maybe we should give this a little more time.
I'm Officer Holbrook.
my partner and I are investigating the murders of Officer Reynolds and Detective Wilden.
you can have this place. It could be our secret.
I took pictures of some of the stories in Ali's journal before "A" got it.
ali wants to meet me tonight. - Well, you're not going alone.
that's the only way she'll meet me.
did you tell anyone about this?
I can't believe you followed me here.
she can trust you but not the rest of us?
she's trying to divide us.
you're doing a really good job of that all on your own.
I'm sorry. - Don't!
well, I missed, like, half the movie.
that dude that was sitting in front of us kept making sales calls.
sales calls? I thought he was breaking up with somebody.
he was. His car.
I swear, if Spencer was there, she would've pegged him with her jelly beans.
okay, I'm sorry.
but seriously. You cannot hold onto this.
Spencer was just trying to protect you.
no, she was trying to control the situation. Like she always does.
Emily, look, she thought that you were making a mistake.
I did. By trusting her. - Em...
no, I was this close to finding out from Alison what happened that night she disappeared.
and now we'll never hear from her again.
Mike? What the hell is this?
dad said I could have a few friends over.
this is not a " few friends.
Aria, chill. - No, I'm not " chillin " !
dad left me in charge for the weekend, and I don't wanna spend the next two days peeling pepperoni off the walls.
uh, hello? This is somebody's desk.
move it!
okay, people are still eating.
well, tell them it's take-out. I'm going upstairs, okay?
you have ten minutes to clear all this people out of here. All right?
come on, Em.
yeah?
Hey, in Ali's story about her date with an older guy, are they talking about "novels and travel" or "shovels and gravel"?
Uh-huh.
I'm trying to piece this together. Her handwriting is so sloppy.
it's like doing mad libs in reverse.
but Ali on a date with a mystery dude, it seems kind of important.
okay, well, the "mystery dude" we should be focusing on is Patterson.
Patterson? Isn't that that kid in world history who's always sniffing his fingers?
no, James Patterson, the author.
this guy just gets the criminal mind.
okay, first of all, when were you interested in anybody born before 1989?
think about it.
the person who tried to kill Alison dumped some random into a hole and tried to make her look like Ali.
maybe we shouldn't refer to the dead girl as a "random.
look, if we follow the trail of "A's" cover-up, it could lead us right back to "A.
Spencer, this guy's a genius.
it's the third book of his I've read this week.
is Travis reading them to you?
no. I'm not seeing him anymore.
I decided not to rush into anything.
wait, so you stayed home to read a book instead of going to that chick-flick with Aria and Emily?
well, I wasn't invited.
Why? - Why?
because Emily is so pissed at you that she's pissed at me for not being pissed at you.
where is your dad anyway? - He's teaching in Syracuse.
I swear, the next time he's out of town, I am so staying at your place.
hello there.
what are you doing here?
using the restroom facilities.
I don't have a toilet in my bedroom, Mona.
what are you doing in my house?
I was invited here. By Mike.
Mike invited you? Here? Why?
this may come as a shock to you, Emily, but some people don't tuck 'n roll every time I walk into a room.
love your wallpaper, by the way. It's so you.
what's up?
can you come in for a sec?
look, I promise I'm not trying to be a hard-ass, okay? We just...
we haven't really had a chance to talk about last night.
I'll finish cleaning after school.
wait.
what's the deal with Mona?
uh, we met in a group at school.
and we have a lot of friends in common.
what group?
it's a discussion group. In the counseling center.
we meet up after school and talk about stuff.
like what? Terror-tactics?
Mr.Fazelli knows Mona's past.
Fazelli retired.
there's a new counselor and he's actually cool.
well, I'm not cool with you cozying up to someone who spent junior year torturing me.
I mean, seriously. Was Mona here to poop or snoop?
all right, I've gotta go.
Mona is a very dangerous person, Mike.
she wasn't sent to Radley for spa treatments.
are you finished? - Mona broke up our parents, all right?
she's the one who wrote to mom about dad and Meredith.
our parents broke themselves up, Aria.
maybe it's time you let go of that and stop judging.
how am I... - People make mistakes, okay?
I've done a lot of crap that I'm not real proud of myself.
and I'm sure someone's standing right now in another bedroom, talking smack about me.
there's no comparison. Mona tried to destroy our family.
well, if you've forgiven dad, why can't you forgive the messenger?
Hey, sweetie.
I went and I spoke with the mechanic myself.
did he say why it stopped?
well, he said it was some kind of computer glitch.
but I drove it home and it runs fine.
dad, it was working fine that night.
then suddenly the GPS had, like, a stroke or something and the engine stopped.
well, he said something probably triggered the anti-theft device and shut it down from a remote location.
baby, you're just driving it to school.
I think if you stay close, it'll be fine.
I'll take my bike.
I'm not shaken up.
Emily, a car plowed into the living room, almost killing you and your ma.
and the fact that the police don't know who was driving...
it has nothing to do with the accident.
well, something's not right.
you're not eating, you're acting jumpy.
it's called senior year, okay?
I don't know what school I'm going to.
there's a lot of questions.
I'll get through it.
okay. I'd still like you to drive to school.
they say it's gonna rain later.
I'm taking my bike. Thanks.
so what exactly was the problem?
the landlord's being a jerk because I broke the lease.
he's withholding my deposit till I give back all the keys.
maybe I could pick up Malcolm early while you deal with the landlord.
Malcolm's not here. He's at home.
as in Seattle?
Yes, as in Seattle. That's home.
I thought you were bringing him back.
I changed my mind.
I'm just here to deal with the lease and ship back some boxes I left in storage.
so, what're you saying, Maggie?
that I'm not gonna have a connection to Malcolm unless it's through an attorney?
Oh, um...I'll just come back later.
no, we're done. I was just leaving.
I'm sorry, I didn't know that she was here.
no, that's okay. That was not going to a good place.
how can she talk to you like that after everything that she's...
flying off the handle isn't gonna help anything, Aria.
people get what they deserve. Eventually.
that's a keeper.
if you like that series, you should really check out some of the Swedish authors.
for some reason, they do meatballs and crime novels better than anyone else.
I hate their meatballs.
I...I really came over to apologize.
my job, it isn't easy.
but it is especially hard when you realize that you've turned innocent people into collateral damage during an investigation.
what I'm trying to say is, I hope that you and your mom are okay.
we're okay. - Good.
here.
get this. You won't regret it.
em, I just got your text. What did your dad say?
it's what he didn't say.
a" killed my car in the woods last week.
what's next?
we don't know that for sure. We need more proof.
do we? Come to The Brew later.
you can watch "a" program the cappuccino machine to melt my face off.
Emily... - No, I don't even feel safe in my own house anymore!
look, if "A" did hack into your car, wouldn't he own up to it by now?
the sociopathic mind feeds on intricate patterns.
Hanna, please stop reading. OK. You're not a detective.
every rock you turn over gets picked up and hurled at Alison.
you can pass that on to Spencer, too.
can you please bury the hatchet with her?
I'm sick of taking sides. - No one's asked you to.
em, I've been through this with my parents, okay?
it sucks and nobody wins.
um, Emily, can I please just say one thing?
okay, stop.
What're you up to? - Excuse me?
drop the cougar-crap and tell me why you're after a 10th grader.
what turns you on? The fact that he shares my DNA or that you have full access to my bedroom?
okay. Jesse warned me that this would happen.
who's Jesse?
the new guidance counselor that's the best thing that's happened to this friggin' school since we got a coffee cart.
he sees through the bull and he has a gift of bringing together people who need each other.
Oh, so you're gonna tell me that Jesse made this little love-connection?
Mona, when it comes to me and my friends, you always have an agenda.
no, you and your friends are the ones with the agenda, Aria.
after I helped Hanna's mom get out of jail, I was burned off like a wart.
that's not exactly what happened.
Really? Then tell me. What happened?
why was I iced out after the charges were dropped?
why did the inner circle squeeze me out again?
right.
well, I'm tired of being yoyo'ed, and I am hanging out with a different crowd now.
so suck it up, Aria.
Oh, hey, Andrew. - Ladies first.
Oh, no, it's fine. I'll come back later.
wait up, killer.
wanna quiz each other on the way to class?
quiz each other for what?
you serious?
did you space on the physics test?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
I'll take that as a " yes.
um...Yeah, I'm just gonna wing it.
this isn't winging material. I've been up all night cramming.
if you've been up all night, how come you don't look like...Me?
sleep is overrated.
okay. Um...you know what?
actually, could you cover for me?
and then if you're not too busy after school, maybe you could come by and give me your physics notes.
Yeah. - Thanks.
Mr.Fitz?
you wanted to see me?
Yes, I did. Please come in.
and close the door.
Whoa! Where's my book? Okay, it was right here.
please tell me you didn't throw it away. I'm on the last two pages!
thank you.
last two pages, huh? I'm impressed.
Oh, well, I always read the endings first.
what? Of a mystery? That's crazy.
no, it's not. How else am I supposed to know what clues to look for?
all right, go back. You've gotta read the middle.
it's the big twist. You're missing the best part of the book.
well, so far, all I'm missing is a reindeer sighting and a canoe trip down a fjord.
what? How do you say it?
you were close.
all right, so what's the twist?
no way, uh-uh.
I'm not into giving spoilers.
Oh, come on. You owe me.
all right.
all I'll say is that it has to do with the dental records.
the ones they used to I.D.the body?
it always comes down to teeth, doesn't it?
Hi. Are you Jesse?
I am. Did we schedule an appointment?
no, I was just dropping by to...
Oh, well, let's not talk in the doorway. Please, come in.
okay.
what's your name?
aria Montgomery. I'm Mike's sister.
Wow. Mr. Fazelli is definitely gone.
do you miss him? - What? Oh, no.
he was kinda old school.
his head sweat a lot. Like a cheese.
Aria, please. Have a seat.
I was just a little curious about Mike's group.
can anyone join or did you handpick the students yourself?
it's open to everyone.
I did reach out to certain individuals who I know have been through some rough patches. Why?
well, it's just...my little brother has, um...
he's befriended this certain individual who's bad news.
bad news? - Yeah.
can you be more specific?
you're referring to Mona.
well, at least you agree.
I didn't say I agreed. But I made an educated guess.
so how can I help you?
look, how do I say this without sounding rude?
try. - Mona's the devil.
and I would really, really appreciate it if you didn't encourage them being together.
sounds like you still have some unresolved issues. With Mona.
if I started, we'd be here till Friday.
well, let's start on Tuesday.
sounds like you could really benefit from joining our group.
Oh, no, you don't understand. This isn't about me.
Aria, it's a safe place.
it's a place where you can explore your anger.
I'm not angry!
I'm just concerned.
and this individual's history supports it.
well, I don't discourage friendships.
if two students bond, it's because they've found common ground.
right.
okay, well, thanks for hearing me out.
any time.
there's been a setback, re: Alison.
Mr. Fitz?
Mr. fields, Emily didn't tell me you were back in town.
I asked my C.O. for a little personal time.
given all the things that have been happening here on the home front.
Yes, well, it's been an eventful couple of months for Emily.
has it affected her schoolwork?
I don't think so.
I mean, senior year can be quite...
rough, yeah, that's what she says.
honestly, I think it's something more than that.
staying at the DiLaurentis house, that may've been a mistake.
my wife tells me that Alison's mother, well...
she acts as if her daughter is gonna walk through the door again.
and Emily stayed and slept in her dead friend's bedroom, and I think it took a toll on her.
Yes, well, I imagine it would.
how can I help?
well, you seem to be one of the few teachers she feels connected to.
I think she really trusts you.
and, well, I'm wondering if you might be able to help get her back on track.
well, I could give her some sort of extra-curricular project.
something she can really throw herself into after school.
I think that might do her a world of good.
well, I'm happy to be here for her.
I do appreciate it.
take care. - You, too.
so one misconception is that a net force is required to keep a body in motion, when in fact it's needed to change whatever current state of motion the body is in.
did you get that?
uh, yeah, I think I did.
nice room. Lot of ribbons.
jumping, dressage...
all these medals from riding?
Yeah. I've got everything in here but the horse.
how many hours would you say you studied for this? In a row?
I don't know, like, seven.
so you're gonna need to know a lot about Newton for this.
I didn't ask you here to study, Andrew.
you didn't?
I've been watching you.
you have?
you're the Captain of the decathlon team, you're a starting forward, and summa cum laude.
it's time to share, Andrew.
okay.
I'm just...I'm not interested in your notes, okay?
I want some of your study aid.
you know, the kind with the childproof cap?
I need to stay up for a while.
I don't have any of that. - Andrew, come on.
I'm your study-buddy for, like, three classes.
Plus, once I showed you my side boob.
I have a legit prescription.
I can give you a few but...
I just need enough to get through the week.
I knew something was up. - What?
since when does Spencer Hastings trust anyone's notes but her own?
why'd you come here then?
I don't know.
I thought maybe you were done with that carpenter.
Thanks.
dad?
Oh, my God! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
are you all right?
it's okay. It's okay.
we're at a college bar. The Hart and Huntsman.
he likes to take me there. But he doesn't like to call them 'dates.
so what do you think about my stories?
you have a strong voice.
but...? - But nothing.
it's only gonna get more distinctive as you grow up.
grow up? - You know what I mean.
mature. - Oh.
so you don't think that I'm mature enough?
I didn't say that.
I just think all great literature boils down to two themes: "Love and death.
whatever.
I don't know why I'm taking advice from someone who doesn't know how to order.
who eats boysenberry pie with beer?
don't knock it till you try it.
I should write a story about you.
maybe I'll write one about this moment...right now.
you're lucky my mom finished her box of Chardonnay.
do you know how loud you were?
you weren't answering your phone.
Spencer, do you know what time it is?
no, I never went to bed. - It's four.
look, who cares, okay? I finally got a lead.
it's the Hart and Huntsman.
what? - It's this pub.
it's a bar outside of Hollis college, where Ali's mystery man took her for pie and beer.
do you wanna come with me?
now? I'm not wearing any underwear.
no, after fifth period. - No. No, I can't.
I scheduled a cleaning at the dentist.
you're gonna pass up finding the person who's after Ali to get your plaque scraped?
Spence, don't you get it? Ali went to the same dentist.
the police used dental records to prove that body was Alison's, and we know it wasn't.
so someone switched the x-rays to match whoever was in that grave.
okay.
if I find out who was in that office after they found the body, we're that much closer to finding out who "A" is.
so you think that "A" went in there as a patient?
it's better than breaking in.
and I know where they keep those records.
I used to file them. - Okay.
okay, so you go to the dentist, and I'll go to the pub.
should we update Aria and Emily about any of this?
no, Emily will lose it if she thinks that we're hunting down clues again.
I don't think I can make her any angrier than she already is.
Spence, this isn't forever.
once we find out who "A" is, all will be forgiven.
Yeah.
hey there. - Oh, hi.
um, it's okay if I park here, right?
well, it depends. How long do you plan on staying?
just as long as it takes me to mail this.
then that's it? Then you're out of here for good?
I think so. Why?
you know how badly Ezra wanted to see Malcolm.
so coming up here without him was a really nasty thing to do.
Aria, it's really none of your business.
Oh, really?
well, it sure was when you asked me not to tell Ezra that Malcolm was his kid.
if you'll excuse me... - No.
no, there is no excuse for someone to lie about something like that and screw up someone's life.
and if you count Malcolm, that's two people.
I didn't realize that you and Mr. Fitz were still so close.
he's lucky to have a student who's so protective of him.
well, Mr. Fitz is too much of a gentleman to kick you to the curb.
but somebody needs to.
I'm guessing that you've done some lying yourself when it comes to Mr. Fitz.
Yeah, but it's not the kind that includes blackmailing his family into paying for a three bedroom house and a fancy summer camp.
well, that's rich, coming from a kid who maintains her grade point average by sleeping with her teacher.
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. - Just leave it.
you ran away? - No. I walked. Fast.
I basically just made things worse for Ezra.
she'll make sure that he never sees Malcolm ever again.
it's not like he asked you to confront her.
it happened in the moment. - It doesn't even matter.
once she tells him...
Aria, you were acting as his friend, okay?
he's not gonna be that mad.
Plus, it's not like you're still seeing him.
all right, well, if I skip his class, will you cover for me?
just in case he asks.
I'll try. I'll be seeing Fitz out of class, too.
my dad drafted me to co-direct the spring play with him.
what? Why?
my dad thinks I'm a basket-case.
because you won't drive your car?
because I tried to stab him with scissors.
your dad? What...
I gotta go.
Sean's coming home from boarding school soon.
he made quite a splash there. Especially with the ladies.
looks like I missed out.
file room
you have a loose filling in number 29.
Dr.Ackard's gonna have to take a look at that.
today? How long is that gonna take?
Why? Are you in a rush? - No.
tooth decay leads to heart disease, Hanna.
didn't you learn that when you worked here?
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Well, then I'm just gonna go back to the waiting room.
Oh, no, you're fine right here, hon. Just sit tight.
Mr. Fitz?
sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
no, it's okay. I just didn't expect to see you in this setting.
have you been here before?
no. No, I never have.
that looks good. What is it?
boysenberry.
or actually it might be BlackBerry. I don't know.
I'm going off a recommendation from the waitress.
Oh, excuse me, could I actually cancel the rest of my order?
I didn't realize how late it was and I actually need to get going.
no problem. - Great.
sorry to run out on you.
are you meeting someone here?
Yeah, I am.
great. Well, it was great running into you.
try the pie. It's pretty great.
Yeah. Yeah, so I've heard.
Hey, it's me.
I was just wondering if Maggie had called.
look, I didn't mean to go off on her like that.
she's probably already called her lawyer and told her that you're involved with some violent psychotic freak.
I don't know what came over me.
I think I'm just so angry and...
just call me when you can. Or not. Bye.
okay, Hanna...
Dr. Ackard, it looks like Hanna Marin couldn't wait.
so I'll call her tomorrow to schedule a follow-up.
she was the last on the books, so I'm going to head out.
I'll see you in the morning.
labor DAY
thank you.
how's it going?
Hey. Good.
been at it for a while over there, huh?
Yeah, it's a history paper, so there's a lot of reading.
I wanted to ask you, have you given any more thought to joining our group?
Um...no.
look, Jesse, I'm not totally clueless.
I know that there's some things that I need to work through.
I just need an outlet, like... - Roller derby?
you have a group for that, too?
no, but I got basketball. Saturday morning pick-up games.
I'll pass. - Fair enough.
well, I want you to know I'm always available for a one-on-one meeting.
my door is always open.
all right.
thank you.
I just...
I really don't want to lose my brother.
would you like to sit down?
what? No.
no, I gotta go. Thanks.
Hey, Dr. Ackard. You know, I think it's really great that Sean's coming back.
I feel bad that we lost touch.
I hope he's not mad at me for...
what's this?
he already paid for it, so I figured why not?
but if anyone asks, I checked your I. D.
boysenberry pie and beer? That's what he ordered?
I know, kinda gross, right?
Yeah. Thanks.
so what do you think about my stories?
you have a very strong voice.
but... ? - But nothing.
it's just going to get more distinctive as you grow up.
grow up?
you know what I mean.
more... mature. - Oh.
so you don't think that I'm mature enough?
no, I never said that.
I just think that all great literature boils down to two themes: Love and death.
whatever.
I don't know why I'm taking advice from someone who doesn't know how to order.
who eats boysenberry pie with beer?
do not knock it until you try it.
I should write a story about you.
maybe I'll even write one about this moment...
right now.
Mr.Fitz?
Mr.Fitz, is that you?
dad? Dad, are you there?
I need you to come to the school and pick me up.
act normal, bitch!
Mr. Fitz isn't here, and I don't want to be here by myself because...
anyway, as soon as you get this message, please come to the school and pick me up immediately.
I'm here. I'm in the back hall.
dad! Dad, I'm up here!
come on!
dad,
dad, I'm up here! Dad, I'm up here!
I'm coming, baby!
dad, you have to get me out!
Oh, yeah! Get me out of here!
there's somebody in here!
come on! Dad, hurry!
come on!
there's somebody in here! He's trying to get me!
Oh, yeah!
the entrance! - I'm coming!
okay, okay. I got you.
we need to get out of here!
we have to go!
hurry up!
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have panicked, but when the lights went out...
dad! Dad!
Oh, my God!
should we call mom back?
no, let's wait till we get to the hospital, yeah?
dad... - Emily, it's gonna be okay, all right?
this is all my fault. - No.
listen, you were locked in a room. The lights went out.
I understand why you panicked.
I don't know how much more I can take of this.
princess, I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to worry about me.
tell me what? What's going on?
Emily, I didn't just come home to check up on you and your mom.
I had some tests done.
I didn't want them done on the base.
what's wrong? Are you sick?
we don't have any results back yet.
it's my heart.
it's just stress.
I'll get it under control.
you have something wrong with your heart?
why...why would you keep this from me?
because I ain't going anywhere.
do you hear me?
you're stuck with me for the long haul, kid.
Hey, come on.
you should take me back. - Em, your mom's right.
you don't want to sleep in a hospital room.
your dad's in great hands and your mom's with him.
a" almost killed him tonight.
Yeah, but "A" couldn't have known that your dad...
you don't know that! He almost died trying to save me! From who?
we're still not any closer to figuring out who this animal is!
what? Who is it?
it's Spencer. I texted her about your dad.
Hey.
please don't send me away.
Oh, my God.
Hanna? - Thank God.
where have you been?
I was at the dentist, and I think that I got treated by "A.
what? You've been at the dentist this whole time?
I thought your appointment was at 4: 30.
Yeah, I know.
and I stole those appointment pages from that September...
you got them? Show them to us. - No, I don't have them.
look, when I woke up, I was in a dentist chair, the lights were off, and my jaw hurt.
I still feel like half of my lip is frozen.
wait a second. You think that "A" froze you?
that "A" stuck a needle in your gums? - I don't know.
all I know is I feel like I've been chewing on a sewing kit for the past hour.
this is crazy.
do we think the same person who hunted me down at school tonight spent the afternoon operating on Hanna?
Oh, my God. Who is this monster?
one of you just please look inside my mouth.
do you see anything? - Stop moving.
it hurts.
Aria, give me the tweezers.
I'm sorry.
okay, okay, okay. Hold on.
okay, okay...
what is that? - I have no idea.
that was in my mouth?
Oh, my God.
what does that say? - I can't read it.
here.
I told you: Dead girls can't smile. Stop looking. - A
Hey, Board Shorts.
miss me?
I came over to apologize.
I hope that you and your mom are okay.
I have a message for you.
ali wants to meet me tonight.
did you tell anyone about this?
I can't believe you followed me here.
what's the deal with Mona?
we met in a group at school.
there's a new counselor and he's actually cool.
Mona is the devil, and I would really appreciate it if you didn't encourage them being together.
it's time to share, Andrew.
I want some of your study aid, the kind with the child-proof cap.
dad! - I'm coming, baby.
dad.
who eats pie with beer? - Mr. Fitz?
a boysenberry pie and beer, that's what you ordered?
the police used dental records to prove that body was Alison's and we know it wasn't.
I was at the dentist and I think that I got treated by "A.
one of you just please look inside my mouth.
I told you. Dead girls can't smile. Stop looking.'A.'
I need it. There's no other choice.
I know I told you to avoid her but you'll have to get in touch with her.
and when you do...
Yes. That is exactly what you say, nothing more.
she can't know yet.
do you think you can get to it? - I'll be careful.
I'll call you back on this phone and tell you where to take it.
your friends just walked in.
Shana, tell me you can get it. - I have to go.
guys.
have you heard her from since?
can we trust her now?
if Ali does, I guess that means we should try.
Shana has too many faces to trust.
I've been keeping count and running out of fingers.
we all got a finger you can use.
it's not the nice kind.
so is your dad going to be okay?
they'll monitor his heart for a while to make sure, but in the long run, he should be fine.
except the part where Shana gave him a heart attack.
it wasn't a heart attack.
the doctors said his chest pains were caused from anemia.
besides, I don't think it was her.
I mean Shana led me to Ali.
why would she turn around and punish me for trying to find "A"?
and we know that "A" is a dude.
maybe Shana's helping this dude.
wasn't she seen sneaking around Wren's apartment shipping boxes to Melissa?
sure, but let's say it's not Shana, you know.
could be somebody else?
maybe it's somebody who's working on the play with Mr. Fitz.
I was the first crew member he brought on.
and he asked you to meet him after school, right?
Yeah, he asked me to copy audition scenes while he was out running an errand.
he said he'd come by if he could.
what about you, Aria? - What about me?
I was just wondering if maybe since you and Jake broke up...
Yeah, that doesn't mean we're back together.
look, look, I've been taking some time for myself.
Ezra and I haven't talked in a really long time.
do you think you could ask him?
no. No asking, no following, no taking a look.
a" gave us an order in my mouth.
I'm just trying to help Emily figure out who was chasing her.
Yeah, but Emily already said that Ezra wasn't there.
I don't know what kind of help he would be.
Yeah. You're right.
I'm cutting you off. You're over-caffeinated.
what? It's herbal tea.
Spencer, I'm about to have a breakdown, okay, and your floppy foot is gonna push me over the edge.
so go sit over there, okay. We're all really tense.
tense?
a" knocked me out, shot me up and played post office between my teeth.
dead girls can't smile.
if we don't keep trying to help Ali, she'll never be able to come home.
Yeah, and the longer that she's out there on her own, the easier it is for "A" to get to her.
we're not doing anything.
we're just gonna wait for her to contact us again.
Yeah, if she contacts us.
I mean I might have biffed that one permanently.
we don't know that for sure.
can we just all agree on this to keep us safe?
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, absolutely.
need help studying. Meet before 1st period?
sorry. All out.
good morning.
is Dr. Griggs in? This is Veronica Hastings.
thank you.
a break-in? Like with robbers or something?
no, no, nothing was stolen.
but I got a chance to chat with the sheriff's office last week.
they said it was most likely a vagrant looking for shelter or kids looking for a place to party.
I mean it's an empty cabin. What do you expect?
so I have to go up there this weekend.
can you get away? Come with me?
it's been a while since we've been up there.
my dad's going up to Syracuse and I can't leave Mike.
is there any way your brother could stay with a friend?
maybe we could drive back and check on him?
just tell him and my dad that I'm staying at Hanna's or something.
Aria, I really need to save the whole weekend.
and I thought we were going to actually be able to use this cabin.
I'd like to spend some time alone with you.
okay, you know what, I'll figure something out with Mike.
when do you want to leave?
okay, this is the last of it. Where do you want it?
I want what's in them.
I checked.
everything that we seized from your house has been accounted for.
I've missed you.
I helped an old lady find her missing cat once.
I don't think she was half as happy.
I finally feel like I have feet again.
so how did those books work out for you?
you finish the one about the teeth?
you know, they kind of creeped me out.
I mean, I feel like I have to floss like crazy so I don't have to go to the dentist anytime soon.
I'm sorry to hear that.
well, if you're looking for another...
actually, I'm giving up on mysteries for a while.
you know, I was gonna sell them back to the store used, but you can have all of them if you want.
no, no, I'm up to my holster in all things CeCe Drake these days.
funny thing about fugitives, they generate a lot of paperwork.
can't skip to the end, can you?
I wish.
interviews, official reports, even a false sighting, it's all worth going through with a fine-tooth comb.
you get details about habits and routines, personality traits.
it's the little things that are infinitely the most important.
sir Arthur Conan Doyle said that.
was it her on the phone last night?
I don't know what you're talking about.
how is she? Is she okay?
if she wanted to give you an update, she'd reach out to you.
Oh, wait, she did and you screwed it up.
Hey, can we not do snide, Shana?
I want us to help each other help Alison.
how? Start a "Friends of Ali" club?
make collages and write fan fiction?
I'm going to be late.
next time you talk to her, can you tell her that I'm sorry?
I'll see what I can do.
so what's up with Spencer? Did you notice her last night?
all jittery and caffeine bug-eyed?
that's pretty much Spencer most days.
she's probably just studying for something.
she was drinking herbal tea.
that girl is strictly espresso.
she's not studying, she's investigating.
sounds like you're investigating.
I'm just observing details.
I was talking to Gabe and...
who? - Holbrook.
and he was telling... - Wait, wait, wait.
detective Holbrook?
are you guys, like friends now?
friends? No.
okay, I didn't even know that he had a first name and now you're calling him Gabe?
is he into fashion or something? - No, Aria.
well, I'm just trying to figure out what you two would be connecting on.
we're just like book club buddies without the monthly meetings.
anyway, he just told me something that I think Spencer might be...
Hanna, she asked a few questions.
she was trying to figure out who went after Emily that night in school.
she's not telling us the truth, Aria.
can we just spend some time with her this weekend?
talk some sense into her before she pisses "A" off?
um, I'm visiting my dad.
he's lecturing in Syracuse and he wants me to look at the campus, so...
well, he goes there like every weekend.
can't you just say next time?
well, I kind of need a break from Mike and Mona too.
they're just a constant barrage of slow jams and lip balm.
I'm sorry, Hanna, I really wish I could, but...Don't worry about it.
I'll figure it out.
I'm so sorry.
Bye, guys.
Hey, Brenda, can I grab you for a second?
so my dad's away on business and the prescription is in his briefcase.
you're still taking them, right?
indeed I am. Just two, are you sure?
you know what, I should probably make it five.
just in case he forgets on Monday and then, you know,
I have got a couple of these tests coming up, so...
it's 50.
I mean, I was just kind of hoping you could spare them.
don't haggle, Spencer. It's tacky.
fifty for first-timers, repeat customers get a discount.
like at the hoagie shop?
do I get the tenth one free?
fifty? Okay, I can do that.
here.
come see me next week if you need more.
you know, in case your dad forgets.
you got a minute?
I just finished reading your essay on Shirley Jackson's short story.
is something wrong with it?
it's sub-par. It's unusual for you.
in fact, you've practically lifted an entire paragraph from Wikipedia.
how bad is the grade? - It's not about the grade.
I'm just wondering what's been keeping you so busy lately.
I've just really been swamped.
what, you thought you'd take a shortcut?
and more importantly, you thought I wouldn't figure out what you've been up to.
I'd like to see you after school.
no normally I wouldn't make this exception, but I think in your case...
I'll take the grade.
you sure? - Yeah.
you know, Spencer, sloppy work leads to consequences.
I'd hate to see you suffer.
Oh, sorry. You were just on your way out.
just about to get a refill. It can wait.
what's going on? - You were right.
I might be a little bit angry but it's not at my brother.
I think the truth is I'm just angry at myself.
is it okay if we talk?
Ezra Fitz Ravenswood address
Hey, Spence, me and Emily are outside your house. Open up.
Hey, Hanna, I'm at the library.
no, you're not. I can see your car in the driveway.
I walked.
um, look, so the police gave me back my shoes finally and I was wondering
no exact matches to your search if you could come over and help me make my closet all neat-freaky.
I would really like to, but Fitz is making me redo this essay, so...
well, come over later?
Yeah, maybe. I really got to go.
Ezra Fitzgerald Ravenswood PA
Mike's experiences with Mona, they are different than mine.
so I have to respect that, I guess.
I guess I'm just confused.
when you came in here, you said you were angry with yourself.
did you want to get into that, or...?
Yeah, yeah, it's...
I mean, I just don't even really know who I can talk to anymore.
I'm lying to my boyfriend.
I'm lying to my friends about my boyfriend.
sounds lonely.
you want to start with the boyfriend?
well, this guy and I, we've had a really long history.
so my friends just might not be very supportive if they knew that we were back together.
and why do you feel your friends would disapprove?
you know what, my brother doesn't have practice today.
I just realized that. I'm sitting here talking to you.
okay, well, I'm glad you stopped by, Aria.
Yeah, thank you. Well, he's probably waiting, so...
this feels like a stakeout.
well, there are no coffee or donuts. Ergo, no stakeout.
it's not the menu, Hanna.
it's the fact that we're parked outside Spencer's house trying to figure out what she's doing and why she just lied to you.
what if she really is at the library?
well, did she take her grandfather clock?
I could hear it clanging through the phone.
is that Shana?
what is she doing at the DiLaurentis's house?
get down.
okay, this right here, this feels like a stakeout.
this doesn't make sense.
last night at the Brew, I'm pretty sure Shana was talking to Ali.
and the next day, she gets in touch with Alison's mom?
does Mrs. DiLaurentis know everything?
does she know who's bones are in Ali's grave or was Shana over there telling her?
or they were they talking about peaches and parasols and Scarlet O'Hara.
you said they knew each other from Georgia.
I know I said we should trust Shana, but I think we should follow her.
no. We are not following anybody."A" said that...
but it's okay if it's one of us?
should we stop by Aria's next and dig through her trash?
maybe you were right, Hanna.
what if Shana really is manipulating all of us?
I don't give a flying crap about Shana.
I care about you.
so if you think this has anything even remotely to do with Alison, just please leave it alone.
let's get out of here.
medication for ADHD. Doctor's note on file with School Nurse
and this is not the teacher's lounge.
man, I keep doing that.
two doors down to the right.
student counseling office. We haven't met yet.
I'm Ezra, English department.
Fitz. Right. I'm still making the rounds, putting all the names to faces.
I hope I didn't interrupt you.
no, no, I was just pulling a file.
I'm having an academic issue with one of my seniors.
just hoping to get some background.
well, if you want to get to the bottom of it, you've got to get them talking, you know.
do they talk?
Yeah. You'd be surprised how much students are willing to reveal about what's going on in their lives, especially when they feel like they have no one else to talk to.
right. It was great meeting you, Jesse.
you too. See you around, Fitz.
Yeah.
I need your help.
okay. How can I help you?
not here. Inside.
if you want my help, you're gonna have to answer some questions.
I'm an open book.
so what about Paige? Was that on purpose?
did you date her to get to me?
when I met her at swim camp,
I didn't know you were the one she was still mooning over.
when I got to town, I put it all together.
you've always acted like you want to come between us.
I saw a button and I pushed.
it let me know what I needed to know.
which is?
you're loyal, fiercely protective, emotional but not a fool.
just like Alison said.
great. So you were spying on us too? For Alison?
not spying, just taking a look around, trying to get to know you.
is that what you were doing in Wren's apartment?
trying to get to know him? - He placed an ad.
hired me to ship and pack some boxes in a hurry.
when he found out I go to Rosewood High, he asked me to be discreet.
be careful with that. It's...
it belonged to Alison's grandmother.
ali said it was a gift for someone special.
wouldn't tell me who. Now I know.
Emily, I saw you and Hanna today at Alison's house.
I figure you're probably going to ask about that too, so why don't we just lay it on the table?
okay.
could you sit? You're making me nervous.
I was trying to get something for Alison, but I never got a chance.
her mother was so happy to see me, I never got a second alone.
does she know Ali's still alive? - No.
are you sure you didn't tell her?
Alison doesn't trust anyone but you.
what were you there to get?
that's where you come in.
there's a poster in Alison's room, some French thing with twins.
Hi, it's Aria, leave a message.
Hey, Aria. I know it's early, but something's been going on and I really have to tell somebody about it.
I really have to tell you about it, but if I'm right then, then that would just break your heart, and if I'm wrong then you're gonna hate me forever.
and that would really, really break my heart.
So...if you could just.
give me a call when you get this message...

Hi, it's Aria, leave a message.
coffee smells great.
how long have you been up?
I didn't really sleep so well.
you want a cup?
no.
Ezra, I think that you need to take me home.
are you still nervous about being up here?
no, I'm not nervous. I'm tired.
you didn't sleep well last night.
no, I am tired of lying to my family and my friends.
I don't even know how many different tales I had to spin just to come up here to be with you this weekend.
look, I know that you have to stay up here, but is there a bus station or a train nearby that.?
Aria, have you ever thought that maybe this feeling you have of being torn between me and your friends is maybe not such a bad thing?
is it supposed to be a good thing?
maybe. I know it feels like you're growing away from them, but maybe this feeling is you and me growing closer.
right, but I want to be able to share that with my closest friends.
and I agree with you.
and I think we're past the point in our relationship where we have to hide.
but if what we have is going to last, you have to start thinking me as the person you're closest to, the person that you want to share everything with.
and I have to do that with you.
maybe this was a bad idea.
starting again and bringing you up here.
I'm so sorry I didn't mean to put any pressure on you, Aria.
no, you didn't.
okay. Why don't you think about it while I take a shower?
and if you still want to go, I can drive you.
wait.
no, I want this.
Yeah, I really want it to work.
Hanna, I'm sorry, I'm just...
Hanna, come on.
I know you were home yesterday.
I heard that stupid clock. Why are you ignoring me?
I'm sorry, okay. It was wrong of me. I just...
whatever it is that you're... - It's nothing.
it doesn't look like nothing.
it looks like you haven't been sleeping.
I just really have a headache, okay.
and so and we were out of aspirin... - And you're lying again.
I just saw you coming down that street, okay.
you did not go to the pharmacy.
I was just in there earlier. - God! Lying!
Hanna, would you back off me?
Hey, you two always fight like that?
no, not really.
I got the impression she was the levelheaded one.
she usually is.
this is the last place I remember seeing it.
it was a stud in a white gold setting.
I've dusted in here weekly since you and your mother left.
I haven't come across a diamond earring.
I borrowed it from my mom without asking.
why don't I go check the guest bathroom?
don't worry, dear, we'll find it. - Thanks.
I found it. - Oh, thank goodness.
now your mother will never have to know it was gone.
Oh, you're back.
I didn't think you'd be gone so long.
Yeah, I just took a walk around the cabin, took a couple of pictures.
Mmm, what smells so good?
a vegetable tagine minus the actual tagine.
and there's no lamb in it. I'm actually using chickpeas.
Oh, a night in Tunisia. So exotic.
dammit, I forgot the chickpeas.
Oh, I can run down to Seymour's.
are you okay? I mean, it's like an hour there and back.
Yeah, yeah.
I actually wanted to take some pictures of that covered bridge on the way.
keys?
by the door. - Bye, babe.

I can't come to you, okay? I'm at work.
what time does your meet start?
half an hour. Do you have it?
it's money, Shana, a lot, and a piece of paper.
you weren't supposed to look.
well, I did. Where does it lead?
look, we don't have time for this.
do you have a locker, some place it will be safe?
no, I mean we keep our stuff under the counter.
don't just leave it sitting around for someone to steal.
where am I supposed to hide five grand?
I'm gonna come by after my meet.
excuse me?
Hi. - Hi. Refill?
Hey, Mrs. Hastings, is Spencer home?
she's just not answering her cell.
did she say where she went?
no, no, no, um, she just borrowed some nail polish and I need it back.
could I stop by?
great. Thank you.
Thanks, Mrs. H. I'll just be a minute.
board Shorta Ale
Ezra in Ravenswood?
where are you going with this, Spencer?
sorry - Hello. - Hi.
I have a flower delivery.
Spencer, you shouldn't be here.
look, I don't want to fight. - Are you on drugs?
what? No, I'm not.
you've got to be on crack if you think Ezra is "A.
I went through your computer.
you should really use a password if you want to keep things private, especially when you're following some crazy theory.
look, one of Alison's stories kept on sticking in my brain and I finally figured it out and I went to "The Hart and Huntsman
and Ezra was there and he was eating the pie.
okay. You're not making sense.
the pie and the beer, Hanna, from the story, okay.
it's called "Board Shorts Ale.
and that's exactly what Fitz ordered when he was there.
and don't you get it? That's where Alison must have got the nickname.
everything's all jumbled up in Ali's stories.
what if you're connecting the wrong dots?
well, come inside. Either I prove it or I'm wrong.
are you coming?
if Ezra comes home and finds us here...
I've been watching the place all day. He hasn't been in or out.
I think he must be out of town. - What are we even looking for?
primarily, a key. Move.
I think Ezra may have rented that apartment in Ravenswood.
if I can find something that puts him there, I'll have proof.
you're really serious about this, aren't you?
wait, let's just say that you're right.
if there's anything that ties him to Ravenswood, he's not keeping it here.
walk away, Spencer.
you know, you're probably right. - That was easy.
I think we're being watched. Don't look.
just follow my lead.
Yeah, I have not been sleeping well lately.
with all this stuff about Ezra in my head,
I don't even know what I was thinking.
sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
where were you when I woke up?
I forgot to lock the back door.
were you up late reading?
Yeah, yeah, for a little bit.
what's wrong? Why couldn't you sleep?
are you worried about us?
I know that I was in a strange place earlier.
and you were right about this not working unless we tell the truth.
are you okay? - Yeah.
I'm just really glad you stayed.
me too.
wait. He has a surveillance camera?
what if the building manager put it there?
it was hidden.
and most honest people put up a sign saying you're being recorded.
who else do we know who likes to hide cameras and spy on people?
but Mr. Fitz? Mr. Fitz isn't...
you're saying that you think he's "A"?
I know. My head feels like it's full of hot ice cubes.
I mean, he was so sweet to me when my mom was in jail.
he helped me with my college essays.
he was probably trying to get close so we'd let our guard down.
have you called Aria? We have to call Aria.
no, not yet.
I don't think we should tell her until we're 100% sure.
well, she's in Syracuse with her dad. So she's safe for now.
Oh, thank God you brought coffee.
here, do you want me to make some?
Yes, but not with that. - That's for Shana.
what does Shana want with a bag of beans?
and why are you still talking to her?
she needed me to help her with this.
Shana give you this?
no. It belongs to Alison.
Shana was supposed to meet me at the Brew, but she never showed up.
there's contact information there, maybe for other peoplewho are helping her or places to stay.
all I know is that Alison's running out of money and Shana's the only one who knows how to reach her.
if she can't deliver it...
ali can't keep on the move. And she's vulnerable.
when was the last time you talked with Shana?
this afternoon. Why?
you said that Ezra never came home today.
do you think he's got her?
I think maybe he wants Shana to lead him to Alison so he can finish what he started.
Shana, do you have it?
I was...I'm... - Shana, do you have it?
do you have the money?
I don't...I'm not sure where I am.
don't COME BACK AGAIN - Shana? - I have to hang up now.
what do you mean? - I'm sorry I have to go.
Shana, what happened to the money? - I don't have it.
what am I supposed to do? - I have to go.
maybe you did it, maybe you didn't.
Sam says you didn't kill her, and I've known Sam a long time.
I've got a lot of faith in Sam. That's why I took this job.
if I had thought you were a professional killer,
I wouldn't have any part of it.
I'm cutting you off, you're over caffeinated.
Hey, Brenda, can I grab you for a second.
come see me next week if you need more.
I signed the agreement.
my dad manipulated you into signing it.
my mother didn't kill herself.
it's over.
all I know is that Alison is running out of money and Shanna is the only one who knows how to reach her.
I'm tired of lying.
you have to start thinking of me as the person you're closest to.
Oh, A Night in Tunisia. - Forgot the chickpeas.
Oh, I can run down to Seymour's.
are you okay, I mean, it's like an hour there and back.
Mr. Fitz.
want to go right, Spencer.
I think we're being watched.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
you think she started up with Ezra and didn't tell us.
had she told you? - Told me what?
found his journal.
you're saying that Ezra left that book for us to find.
which means he knows we know. We have to tell Aria.
Spencer? Are you alright?
how long have you been here?
I don't know.
did you sleep here?
I don't know... I...I came in here.
Hey, take it easy. Let's talk for a second.
I'm fine. I'm just really tired, that's all.
we both know what's going on here.
I think it's time we address the issue... don't you?
the path you've been going down is very dangerous.
I got to go.
Hey. - Hey.
what are you wearing?
it's nothing, I...I had to change.
and this is all I had in my gym locker.
did you? Did you have an accident?
what? No.
or are you going to?
what's up with those shower shoes?
can you just forget about the outfit, okay.
we have an emergency situation here.
is that why you called me at 4 A. M.?
wait, what?
okay, I thought that after we saw Aria liplocking with the devil went home to calm down and crash.
I...I must've just hit dial while I was asleep.
look, okay, I know we said we were going to talk to Aria after school, but I really think we need to tell her about Ezra sooner.
like, now. - What?
Spencer, we can't tell her now.
the longer we wait, the more dangerous it becomes.
and you think it's any less dangerous to drop a bomb like that while she's going into class?
we can't do that to her.
do what? Protect her?
Ezra spoke to me this morning and I could barely maintain eye contact.
meanwhile, for all we know right now,
aria is hooking up with him in some janitor's closet.
how does that not make your skin crawl?
it does. Look, I know you don't want to keep her in the dark.
okay, but this isn't going to be easy.
she's in love with him and she has given up a lot to be with him.
I mean, it's going to be difficult enough for her to believe he's even capable of this.
you had a question about the...the reading assignment for the week?
Oh, yeah.
I was just wondering how much information we have to turn in for the exam.
Hey. - Hi.
I know you have history right now, but I can write you a late pass...
that's okay. What's up?
have you talked to Spencer today?
no. No. Why?
I feel a little strange coming to you with this.
did something happen?
certain things have started to...pile up.
the homework Spencer's turning in is sloppy and rambling, she walks in every morning with circles under her eyes,
I mean, when she's in class, she's either hyper alert or she's a total zombie.
Yeah, I mean, I've noticed that she's been little out of it lately.
but she's had a lot to juggle.
and you know Spencer, she's a total stress-case.
a garbanzo bean in the wrong salad bin is enough to make her her wig out.
right. I think it's more than that.
like what?
she has a problem with amphetamines.
and I'm worried it's become a crutch.
what? Ezra, that's crazy.
well, people think it'll improve their academic performance, but when it's overused...
Ezra, come on, Spencer?
she's got everybody fooled, Aria.
your friend is a ticking time bomb.
and when she explodes I don't want you to get hit by the shrapnel.
I'm sorry, I can't believe it.
you really think that she's on drugs?
I don't think it. I know it.
look.
I wasn't going to show you this.
I guess I'm willing to break the rules if it means helping Spencer.
Aria, I'm not trying to be the bad guy here.
Hey, you.
these are Hanna's clothes. So long story.
you want to tell me about it while we go for a ride?
I would love to, but I've this quiz right after lunch on the French succession of popes.
and right now the only thing I know about them is that they wore pointy hats.
I brought us some food.
are you still mad at me for taking the money?
no. No, I was never mad at you.
disappointed.
I was, maybe a little.
well, I don't think my mom would have been disappointed.
I think she would have wanted me to live my life.
find a way to make it full and share it with the people I love.
you want to start by sharing a sandwich?
Yeah, sounds good.
are you gonna eat that?
Yeah, I told you that like five seconds ago.
just take it. - Thank you.
sorry. I just get...I just get extra hungry when I'm nervous.
I thought it was sad.
I get sad when I'm nervous.
look, I've been avoiding Aria all day.
like I haven't. I finished my Spanish homework in a toilet stall.
are you sure this a good idea?
I mean, what if we tell Aria, Ezra's "A" and then she hates us?
what choice do we have except to prepare for things to get ugly?
finally.
is there some cellular dead-zone that you can know about in the school?
what do you mean?
well, I've texted you both like five times.
whatever, where's Spencer?
I haven't seen her.
okay. Well, we need to find her and talk to her right now.
what about?
right, I think we all know that Spencer's been a little...extra-intense lately.
and I'd just chalked it up to stress, but she's not distressed.
she's strung out.
you guys, Spencer has a serious problem.
all right, and this isn't the first time that has happened.
two years ago it was enough of an issue that her parents had to ask the school for help. Look.
is that okay?
I'm just really tired.
why don't you come over tonight?
I'll get us take out from Bucali's. Rent a movie.
maybe even throw a massage in there if you're good and you finish all your lasagna.
that sounds amazing, I just...I can't tonight.
then tomorrow.
we need some time together. - I know.
that's okay. I got that. - Thank you.
I'd almost forgotten your smell.
see you later. - Okay.
okay. Two diets and a regular, right?
Oh my God.
you guys did it already, didn't you?
did what? - Nothing.
we're not here to talk about that.
we're here to talk about...something else.
Spence, we're concerned.
Yeah, I know. We're concerned.
no, we're worried about you.
me? Why?
are you a speed freak?
Hanna. - What
Spencer. Have you been taking pills to stay awake?
where is this coming from?
what the hell is happening right now?
we care about you.
Yeah, would you and that's why we're here.
right, this is kind of like an intervention.
Yeah, I know. Yours. - Spencer, stop.
we know this has been problem for you before.
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
Where'd you get this?
Ezra. He's worried about you.
you're kidding me, right?
and you two didn't tell her?
he's "A," Aria! Ezra is Board Shorts.
he tried to kill Ali and he's been torturing us ever since.
Spencer, can we please stick to the subject of you for right now.
how can you not see what's happening right now.
he's trying to undermine me. He's being "A"!
please tell me you see what's happening here.
Ezra said that he found you passed out in school today.
that you were barefoot, you were in your pajamas, and you didn't even know where you were.
Spencer, is that true or is it not true?
Spencer? Talk.
Yes. Okay. I slept walked.
to school? - Yes.
and I've taken a couple of pills a few times.
and it's not great, I know, but it's not that big of a deal.
and Ezra is just trying to make it into a bigger deal than it is because he's trying to get the focus off himself because he's freaking "A"!
Oh, my God. This is brilliant.
all right, I know that you're feeling cornered.
Oh, God, Aria. Will you wake up?
this is exactly the kind of deer in the headlights behavior that almost got you shot in the back of a night club.
what night club?
I mean...I am...
okay, I'm confused, but the point is that I'm not crazy, okay.
you just don't see.
how can you guys not see what's happening.
I can't deal with this right now.
Wren? - He's your hook-up?
why did you just swipe the pad?
it's not mine.
I've never even seen that before.
I bet you were a cute baby. - Oh, not really.
I had to start wearing corrective lenses when I was still teething.
Yeah, that sounds adorable. - No, it really wasn't.
no, I cannot believe I admitted that.
I must really like you.
like?
I was...was kind of hoping you'd say that other word.
the one that rhymes with glove?
I didn't mean to go there.
I think the candlelight is getting to me.
so do you want to split the steak and fries or were you more into the chicken?
a steak. Steak sounds great.
I'll be right back. I just...
I have to talk to Mr. Fitz about a reading assignment.
Hello, Mona.
what are you doing here?
I'm getting something to eat.
look. I can't help you anymore.
Why's that?
it's gotten too complicated.
it's always been complicated, Mona.
that's a little too late to back out especially now, when I need your help.
Ezra? - That's me.
thank you.
enjoy your dinner.
so did Aria text you?
Yeah. She said she's staying in.
can we believe her?
Why? You think she's going to go see Ezra?
Spencer may have an addiction, but so does Aria.
love is a drug too.
and who says Ezra doesn't put Aria in a...what do you call it?
altered state. - Yeah, exactly.
I think Aria kept her habit a secret, too.
it's a classic druggie move.
so what are you saying? You still think that Ezra is "A"?
there's too much evidence against him.
we found the Book of Revelations in his desk.
Yeah, but what if that was a plan from the real "A," trying to make Fitz look guilty."A's" does that.
can I come in? Please.
that's all of them.
I don't need them anymore.
are you sure? - Yeah.
look, I know that my credibility with you guys kind of got decimated today, but Ezra is "A."
I'm sure of it.
maybe you are. But we're not.
I know that.
and all I'm asking is for the chance to prove it to you.
I've been studying all the changes.
and I think "A" is trying to cover up the place where he used to meet Ali.
the Hart and Huntsman? - No. Somewhere else.
a place where they can meet and not be seen. See this?
still thinking of Ambrose Pearson.
right, but that's not what it used to say.
originally it said "still thinking of Ambrose Pavilion.
a" changed it so that would sound more like a person's name so that instead of looking for a location, we'd be searching for a guy.
Yeah, some weirdo named Ambrose.
right. So Ambrose Pavilion is in Norristown Zoo.
so how does that prove that Ezra is "A"?
it doesn't. But "A" already knows that Ali's still alive.
and "A" knows that she never got that money in the coffee bag that she needed from Shana.
so all we have to do is convince him that Ali's going to meet us at Ambrose Pavilion to get it.
and you think the person showing up will be Ezra.
Yeah, I could do dinner if it's on the early side.
okay, great.
I'll be leaving in five minutes.
all right, bye.
have you been in your room all day?
Yeah.
it started out as a nap.
I'm leaving to play a round-robin with Tricia and Joan.
wish me luck. - Good luck.
are you still going to join us at the club for dinner?
Oh, I'm totally spaced.
Toby really wants me for dinner at his place tonight.
okay, fine.
but at least come up with a better excuse for me to give next time.
okay.
love you. - Love you, too. Good luck.
Emily We're still doing this tonight right?
Hey, it's Toby. Leave message.
Hi. It's me. Change of plans.
my mom is forcing me to go to dinner with her country club cronies tonight so.
I might be able to make it by after, gonna be on the later side.
I mean, she was just so desperate.
at first she totally denied it, and then she just completely flew off the handle.
when I was getting my teaching certificate, they had us practice confrontations, that could be really difficult, people become really defensive.
defensive?
no, she slid past defense and went straight to offense.
she attacked me, she attacked Emily and Hanna, and she even went as far...
she went as far as to say what?
