well, I mean, I thought I did. I just wasn't too sure.
well, I mean, I thought of it, like the other night.
well, I mean, I was kind of planning on going anyway, so...

well, I mean, after I saw you,
well, I mean, after football practice,
well, I mean, after football practice,
well, I mean, all I wanted to do by coming out here was
well, I mean, all fairness, I did ask you first.
well, I mean, all last week you were ripping on ginger kids and now you are one.
well, I mean, all the other fathers,
well, I mean, all we did was make out.

well, I mean, how far did you go? There's...
well, I mean, how often does someone come along
well, I mean, how will I know? Can you find out?
well, I mean, how's it going with her birth mother?
well, I mean, if - if you like it, then we should go with that one.
well, I mean, if I look at it that way,
well, I mean, if he has a problem with it, he'll let us know, right?
well, I mean, if he...

well, I mean, it breaks my heart to see dad the way he is...
well, I mean, it can't be too serious.
well, I mean, it couldn't hurt, could it?
well, I mean, it doesn't have to be out of the toilet, but, yeah, that's the idea.
well, I mean, it doesn't make any sense.
well, I mean, it doesn't seem like they knew each other.
well, I mean, it is J. J.'s. - yes!
well, I mean, it is a little unusual, don't you think,
well, I mean, it is a milestone, and actually, I am taking stock of my life
well, I mean, it is a milestone, and actually, I am taking stock of my life
well, I mean, it just seems strange that a new boy on the squad
well, I mean, it seemed like you wanted to...
well, I mean, it takes a pretty special woman
well, I mean, it was last night.
well, I mean, it was last night.
well, I mean, it was probably just, you know, an allergic thing.
well, I mean, it wasn't really like a party party. I just had some people over.
well, I mean, it wasn't really like a party party. I just had some people over.
well, I mean, it won't all be over.
well, I mean, it would be the first time in his life
well, I mean, it'll be a challenge, yeah.
well, I mean, it's a lot like quitting anything else, really.
well, I mean, it's a punishing schedule, that's for sure.
well, I mean, it's a... It's a pretty big company.
well, I mean, it's been a month now, right? Dad's already in Barbados with that girl he's known like...
well, I mean, it's for charity.
well, I mean, it's frightfully kind of you.

well, I mean, it's just one question, and the seminar isn't for a few hours...
well, I mean, it's kind of a good thing
well, I mean, it's like a vicarious thrill.
well, I mean, it's none of my business.
well, I mean, it's not exactly how I planned it.
well, I mean, it's not just for anything. It's 500 bucks.
well, I mean, it's not like I ever tried to keep in touch.
well, I mean, it's not like Paris Hilton or Lindsay Lohan hang around the joint, right?
well, I mean, it's not like you were going anywhere.
well, I mean, it's not really mine.
well, I mean, it's not that simple.
well, I mean, it's obvious
well, I mean, it's only a six - month probation.
well, I mean, it's the fairly obvious question, right? If there is a rift,
well, I mean, it's too amazing.
well, I mean, it's us, so -
well, I mean, it's, uh...
well, I mean, its not like
well, I mean, it's got to be at least a couple feet.
well, I mean, just - do you really want him standing beside you on the biggest day of our lives?
well, I mean, just learn to live with it.

well, I mean, maybe that we - you could - because when - when I -
well, I mean, mostly 'cause you know a lot about music and the industry,
well, I mean, no matter what, it'll be better than prom.
well, I mean, no. Like I thought you were, but... And then...
well, I mean, not anything.
well, I mean, not exactly in those...

well, I mean, not literally.
well, I mean, not more than any average kid.
well, I mean, not necessarily.
well, I mean, not one that works.
well, I mean, not only that she likes you,
well, I mean, not primarily, but a little bit, yeah.
