jou-chia asked coolly, "doesn't she know you're about to get engaged, uncle chao?"
jou-chia could only admit that she was not returning from abroad but merely exiting from the interior.
jou-chia forgot all about crying; hung-chien stared at the servant in amazement like a child seeing some strange creature in the zoo.
jou-chia gave the excuse that she was very busy.
jou-chia had already gone to work. Usually hung-chien didn't go to the newspaper office until after breakfast.
jou-chia had already left, and there was no way he could get mama li to understand that young women dressed differently from men. Women had only to put on a heavier overcoat and could then wear unpadded clothes on into winter.
jou-chia had considered telling her aunt everything about the fangs herself. Fortunately, she hadn't let anything out; otherwise, hung-chien really would have raised cain.
jou-chia heard him cry out "ai ya" in pain, and when she saw the spot where the comb had struck him immediately redden and swell up from the blood underneath the skin, she regretted having gone too far, but at the same time she was frightened, expecting him to retaliate.
jou-chia kept a blank face, pretending not to have heard.
jou-chia loved hearing her reminisce, so jou-chia became the sole recipient of her affection.
jou-chia muttered, "she's nicer to me than you are. And the people in my family are nicer than the ones in yours."
jou-chia protested with a smile, "uncle chao, you mustn't call me that. I'm not worthy."
jou-chia stared hard at hung-chien. Hung-chien again tightly gripped the armrest of the chair.
jou-chia stepped stiffly onto the carpet without showing the least intention of kneeling down. Hung-chien, together with jou-chia, bowed three times and was done.
jou-chia then asked her what food she had bought that day and said with relief, "oh, very good, but you should have let mrs. fang take a look at them so she wouldn't think we are starving her son."
jou-chia took his hand in lieu of a reply.
jou-chia tried to get her aunt to like her husband more by always having hung-chien take the dog out to relieve itself, something which did nothing to improve hung-chien's feelings for it.
jou-chia was wearing her new clothes today, and her courage was high. Besides, she was a little curious.
