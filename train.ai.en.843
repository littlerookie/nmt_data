my father came up with it.
well done. - Yeah.
all the Luchadors use it, along with a bunch of other holds he developed.
let me try it on you. Fair is fair.
okay. - All right.
so this arm goes here and-- whoa!
I don't know what move that is, but you should copyright it.
wait.
what's wrong?
what you just said -- your case.
okay, don't move.
I'll be right back. - Okay.
okay! All right. I really have to go.
Hey, I was just coming to find you.
I'm about to have sex-- crazy Lucha sex with the daughter of a man who could, and most likely will, just tear my head off.
but I got to tell you something quick, so go ahead. - No, no, go first.
no, you look like -something's wrong. - No, go.
we got to get Hanna on the phone, get her over here now.
you thinking threesome?
no. Maybe. No.
no. Look, Amelia was showing me some of Ultimo's moves, and then I figured out how to win the case, all right?
I'm gonna say two words, then I'm gonna get back to having the sex I so richly deserve-- "Copyright law.
good, but I don't think you're gonna have time for that threesome, - or even the twosome. - No, no, you said
come on. Come on.
tell him.
I accessed the banking system in Jamaica.
Accessed"?
well, if they spent less time smoking giant blunts and not washing their hair and more time on building firewalls
Whoa! Whoa! I can't even believe you just said that.
you know what, if you spent less time in your little germ-free fortress
no, that's what they do.
they smoke blunts and-- You're racist!
I'm not white. I can't be racist. - Yes, you are.
stop! Both of you!
Gibson Hawke's bank account was closed out three days after his death.
by Infeld.
you know, Hawk and I were like brothers
well, so were Cain and Abel.
you know, we had a slush fund in the form of an offshore account for gambling.
if anything happened to the other, who was ever left would empty the account and disburse the money to charity.
well, because of the way I lived, I always assumed that it would fall to him.
Stanton, I don't know how to say this, but maybe we should consider, you know, pleading guilty.
Yeah, that's- that's smart.
a-a lawyer should always be dispassionate.
so you want us to...
look, if I thought for one moment that I murdered my friend,
I would have pled guilty that night.
now, although I can admire your skepticism, if you guys want to step aside,
I'd be happy to represent myself from here on out.
that's not gonna be necessary.
we're gonna win this for you.
I made it clear that you were to surrender the mask
we're filing a counterclaim against the league for violating Ultimo's intellectual-property rights.
I want that mask! It's my time!
Mr. Jacks, please tell your associate to pipe down, or I'll have my bailiff...
escort him out of the courtroom. - What?
while the league owns Ultimo, they don't own whatever moves he developed while he was
that's ridiculous, Your Honor. The moves are part of the character.
can you show me where it says that?
your Honor, you said you were bound by the contract, which lists all rights granted to the league, but it doesn't mention moves.
it's weak, Miss Linden.
weak? It's-- it's comatose, Your Honor.
it's enough to take it to trial.
your client may keep the mask...
... Until the issue has been further litigated.
nice work.
it's in the bag, and you do the comatose joke.
the trial won't be for another three months, so until then
they can't take the mask. I know.
and I know, to you, it's just a mask.
and I know how I must look.
you don't look- I kept this for 25 years by fighting for it.
and thank you for fighting for me, really, but I didn't climb into the ring every night to have some piece of paper tell me whether or not I deserve this mask.
that night on the mountain, when you stabbed Mr. Hawke, you had no choice, isn't that correct?
I had a choice.
I could have let the rest of my team perish on that mountain, or...
I could have killed my best friend.
and lied about it.
look, I've had occasion to re-live every moment.
Ah, of course I have regrets, but protecting the name of my best friend, even if I had to lie about it, isn't one of them.
thank you. No further questions.
you said you and Mr. Hawke beat each other up and that was just part of your competitive natures.
Yes, that's right.
and you had no motive to kill him?
no. I loved that man.
hmm, then, perhaps you can explain why you emptied out his bank account three days after his death?
Objection! - You've been a lawyer a long time.
wouldn't you agree that money is a pretty compelling motive
objection, Your Honor! - Your Honor!
counsel, approach.
she cannot blindside us with new evidence in the middle of trial.
well, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise, seeing as how we got it from someone at Infeld/Daniels.
what are you up to?
why don't we take this in my office?
you mean Stanton's office?
what, you don't want everyone knowing that you're helping the D. A. convict him?
I'm not going to apologize for following the rules.
it's the responsibility of both parties to turn over all evidence
that you plan on using in court, which we weren't.
which I'd know if I was kept in the loop.
I hear you talking about a bank account, it shows up on the firm's server...
so you send it to the D. A?
along with hundreds of other documents.
I don't know what your motive is here, other than helping the other side send Infeld to prison, but we're done taking orders from you.
we got a case to win. Our way.
I hope you do.
for all your sakes.
that's right.
Franklin and Bash! No one tells us what to do!
except Infeld.
and Carmen. - Yeah.
karp sometimes. - Speaking of Karp...
I heard about court today. I was just gonna go see Stanton.
you want back on the trial team?
hell, yeah. But what about Brett?
you gonna let her tell you what to do?
last time I checked, we run this place.
uh, no, you don't. I'm in.
trial team group hug? - Let's do it.
no.
Hey.
what have you been talking about with Brett?
she's offering me a senior partnership in New York.
thought it was something like that.
don't trust her.
Why? Is she lying?
worse.
she
you may have fooled the judge, but when he's forced -to look at the con
what's up?!
what the-- what the hell's going on here?
we invited him.
you know, there are better ways to handle all of this.
Yeah, the Lucha way.
I'm not afraid. You afraid?
hell, no. Let's do this.
okay, we- We decide when a fight is sanctioned, so
then sanction it!
your guy wins, you get the mask.
Ultimo wins, he keeps it and gets to defend his title.
either way, you get to promote the fight and collect the gate.
done. - Done.
I already said "done." - Well, I just wanted it clear.
she knows.
we're done.
thank you.
don't thank me. Kick his ass.
bend your knees.
Ernie, uh, take over.
Hey, stick with the wuji. - Yeah.
you okay?
Yes. Thank you for asking. I'm okay.
you know we still have a shot.
you know, you boys did yourself, and me, very proud.
I still wish there was someone else to tell the story.
well, unfortunately, dead men tell no tales.
actually, Stanton, they do.
call the court. Tell them we have one more witness.
stay with Stanton.
just another moment, Your Honor.
you have conducted yourself with surprising decorum.
I only hope that when Mr. Bash arrives, he doesn't have one of your desperate stunts up his sleeve.
no, Your Honor. - I'm here!
as its final witness, the defense calls... Gibson Hawke to the stand.
told you it wasn't a stunt.
over my dead body.
got a minute?
I've got one.
what can I help you with?
go back to New York, for starters.
excuse me?
we've been looking at the firm's charter, at the line of succession here in the L.A. office.
and if my Uncle's convicted, I'm next in line.
then me, but if we're not around...
Yeah, say, if one of us becomes a judge and the other one goes to New York...
I have no intention of staying in L.A.
Really? That's weird.
because you've been looking at houses in Bel Air with a broker.
and how would you know that?
involving yourself in a murder trial where you stood to gain by your client being convicted.
that's not gonna play well on "Anderson Cooper," is it?
step aside, Brett.
it's the toughest thing to do. But sometimes, it's the smart move.
that was like a minute, right?
Yeah. - Yeah. Awesome.
I've cleared the courtroom, and I have my special "Contempt of the court" pen at the ready, gentlemen.
I hate that pen.
you are asking to bring a corpse into my courtroom?
no, t-that would be ridiculous.
we want to bring the court to him.
jury field trip to the morgue.
a field trip? Really?
you sure you got signed permission slips from your moms?
actually, we got one from yours.
last night. - Enough!
if you can find me one case where a body was brought into the court
Formosus. Not the most current case. It's from '96.
Yeah, that's 15 years ago. That's fine.
actually, Your Honor... 896.
so 1, 100 years ago.
no, Your Honor, please wait. - Your Honor, Your Honor, papal courts of Rome. They dug up Formosus and tried him posthumously.
I meant a case from this millennium or the last millennium.
okay, well, since we're talking about dead people, let me mention another one-- Thomas Jefferson.
he wrote a little thing called the Constitution.
you are kidding, right?
maybe the founding fathers are a joke to D. A. "Nutella," but not for us.
the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment.
it states that a defendant is entitled to face his accuser.
took con law three times.
face his accuser? He's dead.
look, the prosecution's theory has been that our client hated Gibson Hawke.
we've argued that Infeld would never hurt Gibson Hawke.
all we're saying is, enough talk from the lawyers.
well, I can't disagree with that.
let the jury gauge for itself how Mr. Infeld reacts to facing his friend.
you said if we cited a case, Your Honor.
your words.
okay. Let's have a field trip.
you want to sit together on the bus?
no, I want to stab myself in the eye with your tiny body.
think she likes me.
have you had further occasion to conduct analysis on Gibson Hawke?
Yes, I've taken samples of brain tissue.
we have an implement that allows us to drill directly
okay, we get-- we get the picture.
your Honor, a moment with counsel?
you look pale. - He's smiling now.
okay, all right. Tag out, Lucha style. I got this.
what my woozy partner meant to say was, why didn't you do it before?
well, based on the stab wounds, the cause of death seemed clear.
and what did your new autopsy show?
at the time of his death, Mr. Hawke was suffering from hypoxia, otherwise known as mountain fever.
and what are some of the symptoms?
uh, psychotic breaks, irrational rage, extreme violence.
so, if Mr. Hawke was in one of these rages, a person acting in self-defense could have had to stab Mr. Hawke in order to stop him.
objection. He's creating his own scenario.
based on the evidence. Same as you.
the only difference is, you have to prove yours beyond a reasonable doubt.
overruled.
Mr. coroner man
uh, Mr. Conti. Bruce Conti.
isn't it possible-- excuse me
reasonable that my client was acting not only in defense of himself but the entire climb team when he killed Gibson Hawke?
I- I would say, uh... More than reasonable.
no further questions.
decent dog and pony show.
it must've been more than decent, or you wouldn't be talking to us.
he pleads guilty to filing a false report
three years probation and 2, 000 hours of pro bono work.
seems a bit stiff.
I accept.
um, but I just have two requests. Make it 5, 000 hours.
uh, you understand how negotiating works, Stanton?
and a moment, please, with Gibson.
I never got to say goodbye.
farewell, dear friend.
perhaps now you will... Rest in peace.
that's what I've always wanted for you.
Oh, my.
come on, Ultimo!
come on, get up, get up!
whoa, whoa, whoa! This is ruenos perno. The thunderbolt.
finish him! Come on!
I taught him that!
one of the benefits of jail-- you get to realize the value of economy of space.
I mean, who needs all this room?
I just wanted to welcome you back.
I expect you're wondering why I kept you off my trial.
Yes, actually.
and you think that I value Damien, Jared, and Peter more.
it's hard not to see it that way.
you know... I kept you off my case because you mean more than they do.
you're gonna have to explain that one.
look, this firm is bigger than any one person, a-and you just won the Lucha case.
that old fighter's needs were no less important than mine.
which is why I've decided that if and when I step aside...
I want you to run this firm.
not Damien?
Oh, no. Damien, he wants to be a judge.
besides... I have my heart set on you.
welcome back.
Hey! Congratulations.
Ah, hey! Ultimo.
and Ultimo's giant friends. Congratulations, huh?
thank you. - Yeah.
we heard from the league.
they're broke. Dalton and Jacks took off.
they owe Ultimo his share of the gate.
and us our attorney fees.
right. - That blows.
it doesn't blow too bad.
they're in default, so we get whatever asset they have left.
wait. You mean
you're 50% owners of the Fuerte Lucha League.
along with me.
Yeah!
you come here. I want to talk to you.
we can talk right here.
uh, yeah, okay, um, it's good right here.
but, Ultimo, we won. You don't have to take
you're with my daughter now. That's like family.
I- I like Amelia, but I don't know if we're together, you know,"with" so much, you know.
business partners.
business partners.
thank you.
found that fake head you put in my bed.
you liked that, huh?
solid effort. - Thank you.
but I just want you to know that if we were somewhere and you started acting all crazy, it would be my honor to kill you.
Aww. I'd kill you, too, buddy. - Hey.
all right, you get to choose how and where you die.
game 7, World Series, Dodger Stadium
Jessica Alba and I making love in a luxury box.
the minute the Dodgers clinch, boom, struck by lightning-- dead.
put a lot of thought into this. - Yes, I did.
what about you?
eaten by lions. - Really?
no sleeping with Marisa Tomei or jamming with Keith?
that's selfish, man.
we gonna join, or we gonna sit back?
no, I can't.
you coming?
where the hell is your father?
take a deep breath.
you look good. - Thanks.
probably because yesterday I was baptized and accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior.
enjoy Jesus.
enjoy your depraved hedonism.
say hi to the Swede!
who's the Swede?
some boy she's flirting with at the pool.
if you leave Matt, no one is gonna love you any less.
you realize that.
I really miss having you around.
maybe it's colic.
honey, it's not colic.
well, Julie, she was colic.
I love you so much, but you don't know what you're talking about.
Julie was not colicky.
the only time Julie ever cried was the time you slammed her hand.
that was 15 years ago, and you're the one who let her...
you know what, were you asleep when I called?
no. - Yes, you were. Go back to sleep.
no sense in me going back to sleep now that I'm awake.
go ahead and talk to me. - All right, darling, how's work going?
it's good.
that doesn't sound very convincing.
it's good, it's good. It's like being... you know...
this bed's uncomfortable, for one thing.
and the other thing is, that, it's like being the new kid in school.
there's this inner circle, you're never part of it.
all you have to do is be indispensable.
and you and I both know that's just what you do so perfect.
that's a very wifely thing for you to say.
Oh, now you got her crying.
I miss you and I love you.
I love you, baby. I love you.
Bye-bye.
Landry, what-- what time is it?
why are you calling me?
look, I can't find my watch.
what? - I can't
I can't find my watch.
the last time I had it was...
even if somebody found that watch, they're not gonna know is yours, okay?
that's fine, Tyra, except for the fact that it's engraved "to Landry from grandpa.
it's probably with the body.
can you take a deep breath and calm down?
I could but that's not gonna matter when I'm in the electric chair.
okay, Landry, this is not normal, what we're doing right here.
I'm sorry if I'm embarrassing you right now.
no, you're not embarrassing me.
we're not supposed to return to the crime scene.
I didn't realize you were so knowledgeable about this.
maybe you should just write a how-to book...
that's helping right now. Those nasty comments, that's great.
I'm trying to hold it together.
think anyone's looking for him?
friends or family or someone?
let's go home.
come on.
let's go.
let's go. Watch your footwork!
eyes up!
hey Aaron!
yeah? - Coach wants to see ya.
all right, keep it up.
I do wind sprints and gasses...
coaches... Antoine.
Antoine here is in trouble with the infractions committee for accepting gifts from a booster. Isn't that right, Antoine?
Taylor, I need for you to escort this knucklehead to his hearing tomorrow because I don't trust that he can make it there on his own.
we fully expect him to be suspended for the season because he was stupid enough to get caught at the Justin Timberlake show with an agent.
Justin Timberlake.
hope it was worth it, Antoine.
step off. Little white boy's got soul.
I don't wanna hear another word out of you.
what about, uh...
I mean, how about practice?
don't worry about it. We'll cover it.
all right, since we got that covered, we taking my car.
hello. - Hey, Glen, come on in.
gosh, thank you so much for seeing me at home like this.
you're welcome. Let's just go on on the kitchen there, okay?
okay.
you can probably find a spot on the table.
really, again, thank you for seeing me at your home.
that's probably an inconvenience to you.
it's fine. - I mean these kids, there's so many of them. You know, they're coming at me like ninjas.
I know. They do that.
wow, I hope you didn't go to all is trouble just for me.
I just had a baby, Glen.
I'm-- I was kidding. I'm sorry.
what's the problem? Let's just go over it.
okay, um, Barry Harby...
Barry Harby Jr. Linebacker. - Right.
he's telling you he can't read? - He said he can't.
the football players are gonna mess with you.
he's just trying to get into an easier english class.
you can't let these kids ride roughshod all over you.
who's next?
right, Tiffany Barnes.
she wants you to write her a recommendation?
Yeah, she does. To Vassar. - To Vassar.
she can't get into Vassar any more than I can get into my old jeans.
you see what I'm saying? - Absolutely.
how's she doing with the divorce of her parents?
I have no idea.
look, I'm a science teacher.
I teach science.
and I'm a little out of element, you know?
and I don't know if there's any general words of wisdom that you can give me.
or if you have a book or anything I could read. Or you could refer me...
it's just-- you need to just connect with these children, that's all there is to it.
hey hon!
you know what, listen, I was thinking tonight, if you wanted to, you and Matt could rent a movie and order in some food, and you could bring it over here, have a little date night.
what is it with you? Matt this, Matt that.
you know Matt has his own life, right?
who's next?
please hurry up! We're already late. Can we please just go?
I don't know if we're supposed to pick Julie up or not.
I left her, like, four messages and she never called me back.
so I don't know... Maybe if we just go by her house see if she's there, and if she's there, then we're supposed to get her. And if she's not...
we could do that. Or maybe your testicles are just in her panty drawer, Matt.
have you ever thought about that? Even I know that she's
what is that...
how you doing? - Good.
should I sign for it? - Hey, thanks.
grandma, what'd you order?
is that my tiara?
tiara? - Is it?
look how pretty!
that'll be beautiful for whenever you just zip over to the rite aid.
grandma, no. It was $2, 400.
we gotta send this back.
look how pretty. - Beautiful.
it's really pretty, but it's really gotta go back.
Oh, boys. - Look at... Look at her.
you can't put a price tag on happiness.
and again, we're glad to have coach Mcgregor here.
came out of those hills of Tennessee - to the great state of Texas. - Thank you, Buddy.
Oh, again, season opener pep rally is coming up.
and I'm proud to say that Garrity motors will sponsor and host as we have so many years in the past.
buddy...
we've all been talking.
we thought it'd be nice if we had a new venue this year.
well, what do you mean we've all been talking?
well, Lester's got his ranch.
there's a lot of space indoors and out.
we can barbeque, make it a family affair.
you know, make it, I don't know, more wholesome.
Garrity motors is wholesome.
buddy, you got a lot going on right now.
what does that mean, Lester?
buddy, it's just a party. It'll be fun.
I sure hope you can make it.
look, I need that in-home care that you promised me, all right?
I call y'all people once... - You gonna get the door?
I call y'all people once a week.
checking in on it. I'm taking care of my grandmother who-- yeah, I'll hold.
you want me to talk to 'em? You're obviously not getting
I'm on hold, you can't really talk to 'em.
like 30 minutes...
Hey, Julie.
um, I didn't know if you needed a ride.
so I called you a couple times.
Oh, I'm sorry, my phone was dead.
Oh, all right. - I got a ride with Lois.
okay, well, do you wanna maybe...
you wanna do something?
Yeah, um, give me a call later, okay?
okay. - See you later.
Hello?
Christ, shield me today from wounding.
christ with me, Christ before me.
christ behind me, Christ in me.
christ on my right, Christ on my left.
christ above me, Christ beneath me.
christ when I lay down, and in our hearts.
christ in our families.
christ in the hearts of everyone who thinks of us.
and Christ in the mouths of everyone who speaks of us.
all right!
good catch, Smash!
see that boy? Thing of beauty!
it was a good toss, all right? Good read, Saracen.
coach!
am I a thing of beauty, too?
let me ask you something, Riggins.
can you count to 50?
Yeah. - Good.
then I got 50 for you, right over there.
hit it! Let's go!
50 good ones. Let's go!
come on! Come on!
let's get it on! Let's go!
come on, Clark! Let's run this thing again!
feet on the ground, son! Get your feet on the ground!
you gonna slap his ass upside down!
come on, son!
dig a little deeper, all right, boy?
you're on offense. - All right, shake it off now.
dad.
looking good out there.
you sure you talking about my
I was just getting my ass handed to me by Riggins, like, five times in a row.
I can't really feel my right ear for some reason.
give it time. You're on the team. That's all that matters.
I'm real proud of you. I mean it.
alright.
pretty good. - I know, right?
what do you think it means?
you're still recovering from your injury.
you've been great about your physical therapy.
and that's some of the reasons your muscles are coming back.
this improvement in your hands, it's wonderful.
but it's no necessarily indicative of anything else, if that's what you're thinking.
Yeah, but who's the say that
Jason, I am.
you're not gonna walk again, Jason.
at least not without a major medical breakthrough.
and it is something we are still years away from.
hey dude, what's up?
same old crap.
he just told me I'll never walk again.
again.
depressing as usual, eh?
I just thought...
I know this guy.
he does some experimental stem cell surgeries down in Mexico.
heard they're doing really good with it.
and kick. And kick.
all right, bring that knee... This is my house!
I need you out of here! This is my exercise time!
did you hear me? I said get out!
help!
get out of my house!
get out! - Gramma
thank goodness, Matthew.
she tried to turn off my tv!
who tried to turn off
she did. - See, grandma, there's nobody here
no, there.
okay, who are you?
don't let her throw away my tapioca.
the in-home nurse you demanded.
this is junk.
that's what I have every night.
I need to get rid of this tv.
Oh no no no, see
Oh, get out of my house!
I can't. It's my job. - We tend to keep the tv on.
'cause it seems to be the only thing that calms her down.
it's destroying her mind.
I'm sorry, but a lot of things are going to have to change.
like?
where am I supposed to sleep?
what do you mean, sleep?
I mean sleep. I'm going to live here.
what you doing, coach?
tell me what you're gonna say to the committee.
I got it down, no worries. - Good, let's hear it.
Nah, coach, I want it to sound spontaneous.
you know, from the heart.
that's great, so let's hear it then. Be spontaneous.
all right.
I'm sorry that I took those tickets to Justin Timberlake.
especially when they didn't have no cristal in the box!
can you believe that?
I don't drink no cheap stuff. - That's real funny.
you know what's not in your little speech, though?
what's that, coach? - Put a little contrition into it.
you know what that is?
I got an idea. But that's probably because I'm not sorry.
you're not sorry. - No, sir, I'm not.
you hear that, America?
I'm not sorry! How about that?
tell me, hot shot, you payed for this car all yourself?
Oh yeah. All by myself.
you pay for all that nice jewelry by yourself?
Yes, sir, I got a paper route.
Oh, come on, coach!
everybody know we take stuff!
look, I play football!
hell, they should be paying me.
I bring a million dollars to this school every year.
shoot, this stuff started for me when I was in pee wee.
I got a ice cream. - Hey, baby, how you doing?
everything's fine.
me and Gracie are out for a walk, walking to school.
and in fact, Gracie has a couple of words for you. Hold on.
don't do that. Now's not the time.
talk to your daddy.
Hello, it's dad.
it's daddy. I love you, Grace.
I love you. Dad loves you. Hey, I love you.
now, let me talk to mom. Tammy, hello?
I gotta go. I'll call you back-- bye.
I-- what? - I just wanna ask you one thing.
what you doing in the car with me when you have a new baby?
you don't just open the door, Buddy. This is not your house anymore.
what are all my trophies doing out in the front?
I don't want 'em anymore.
you get 'em out of here by Sunday or they're going in the garbage.
and you're early. - Yeah, five minutes.
can I come in my house? - No. You know what, frankly, Buddy?
I don't think feel safe.
I'm sorry, Pam, about the other night.
you know... I admit, I lost it.
I just, uh...
you know, a man can only be pushed so far.
don't you even dare talk to me about being pushed, Buddy.
I am the victim here. - I think it's about time for us to lose the victim stuff.
you're too much
I can't believe you!
mom.
come on, dad, let's get this over with.
okay. Hey, Bud.
Hey, Thabs, let's go.
Hey, what's that, a soccer ball?
Yeah. - All right, let's do it.
gonna have some fun!
there's always, like, a middle man of bands.
you gotta get songs written.
I always have problems with lights.
and I always want a smoke machine or something like that.
how often do you get a smoke machine in a place with a band, right?
thank you.
Hey, what are you doing?
just picking up my paycheck.
okay.
so where did you go the other night?
Oh, um, I actually-- I had another party to go to.
Oh, cool. Ah, no.
I mean, someone had said they saw you get picked up by your dad or something.
that was my older friend.
Yeah.
but I got a lot of studying to do, so I'll, uh... I'll see you around.
Oh, that's right. School started, huh?
Yeah. - Okay.
so... So I guess this is good-bye?
I guess it is.
all right, well, hey, don't go growing up too fast, 'cause you're gonna be a heartbreaker.
guys are just gonna be busting down your doors, so watch out.
so I'll see you around, kid.
Hey, Glen.
hope you don't mind. We just dropped by.
I'm gonna plop down on your couch right now.
I'm exhausted. I just walked all the way from my house.
you walked all the way from your house?
Yeah, we did. It is boiling hot.
Yeah, it's 105 degrees out there.
that's completely insane.
well, it's not insane when you have a baby who won't stay quiet unless you're movin' her all the time.
and I figured I'd kill two birds with one stone.
right.
what's your problem with that, Glen?
it's no problem, it's just that you're profusely sweating, you got a newborn baby.
you're walking in 105-degree temperature.
you're perspiring. It's your glands.
I'm sorry, I don't need you talking about my perspiration.
I don't need you talking about my glands.
I came to talk about the job.
which you might need a little bit of help with.
I might need a little bit of help with it.
I'm really not qualified to be doing it.
but I think what's more important is your behavior, you bringing this baby here.
I'm concerned about the baby's health.
it could get sick here. - Excuse me,
let me tell you something right now. Right here and right now.
this isn't my first barbeque, Glen, all right?
so I don't appreciate you going on and on and on about what a bad mother I am.
I'm not trying to say that you're a bad mother.
Oh, really? That's what it sounds like to me.
I'm not trying to say that you're a bad mother.
what I am saying, although... - Now look...
I'm afraid to say it to you right now, because, frankly, you frighten me a little bit.
you got a lot of nerve.
I'm just trying to help. - Well, no, I was trying to help.
I was trying to help by coming over here which I think you need a little bit of help.
so don't you go and you judge me on what kind of mother I'm being.
how dare you?
that's not what I was trying to do.
well, how dare you? 'Cause that's what it sounded like.
I'm sorry. I'm not trying to upset you or...
well, too late.
this is just a bad idea.
you know what, you just go on and do your job.
you want something to drink? You want some water or something?
you know what, I'm gonna get you a glass of water, okay?
Hey, uh. Julie, it's Matt.
um, you told me to call later.
and it's later, so I'm calling.
anyways, call me back.
and then I'll talk to you later.
sorry, Gracie.
there's a bump.
Hey, Mrs. Taylor!
hey hey! Jason Street. How you doing?
I'm good. How are you? - Great, never better.
awesome. I was wondering if I could have
see baby Gracie? - Hi, Gracie.
I was wondering if I could have a second of your time?
sure. No problem.
we're just walking home.
I've been having this dream lately.
a lot. And you're in it.
so in the dream you tell me to get up and walk.
and I do.
I walk 'cause you told me to. You make me walk.
Really? - Yeah.
and one day after having the dream,
I found out I could do this again.
I can make a fist with my right hand. Which I couldn't do before.
and I still can't do it with my left, but...
that's great, that's great, Jason.
I just wanna talk to you, 'cause I feel like...
like it really means something.
I think it means I'm gonna walk again.
soon.
how about that?
so, uh, anyway, I guess I just want to say thank you.
you have a great day. Bye, Gracie.
you're welcome. I'm so glad I got to see you today.
me too.
you have a great day, Mrs. Taylor! Thank you.
hurry up, let's go.
let me ask you something, coach.
you got that baby on a schedule?
Oh, wait, you wouldn't know that, would you?
no, but seriously, how's your wife feel about being alone with the baby?
that was a question, coach.
hurry up, let's go.
look at that scowl.
I gotta get a picture of this.
hold on. I'm gonna send this to your baby.
think everything's a damn joke, don't you?
it's all a big damn joke to you.
all the talent you got, what do you use it for, huh?
getting free stuff and letting your team down.
you know what my opinion is?
you don't deserve to play the game. What do you think about that?
who do you think you're talking to? - You let your team down, you let yourself down. And you don't care
you don't care if you finish out the season.
cause I'm sure big ol' Antoine, he's got it all figured out.
he's got a backup plan, doesn't he?
who am I talking to?
who am I?
who the hell are you?
Oh, hey, Landry.
I just wanted to say congratulations on making the football team.
I'm actually sort of your rally girl.
sort of my rally... - Yeah.
so you're my rally girl?
wow, Landry.
your own personal rally girl.
I guess you've arrived.
anyway, we can work out the details later.
I just wanted to say hi.
you think that all human beings are capable of evil?
I'm gonna borrow him for a second.
I mean, obviously some are.
I was asking her a question. You don't have to rip me away.
I'm not a little kid. You don't have to hold my arm.
Bye, thank you. - Bye. What the hell are you doing?
what am I doing? - Yeah. Are you insane?
you have got to hold it together.
do you have no empathy about anything, Tyra?
so you have ice water running through your veins?
a human being is dead because of me.
and what are you doing?
you're out having a great time.
and you know what, he was a rapist, okay?
stop acting like he was some kind of a saint.
I'm not acting like-- - Act like a man then!
want me to act like a man.
Yeah.
see, that's real easy for you to say, because you're not the one who killed him, are you?
you don't have to think about that.
you don't have to close your eyes and hear the sound of his skull cracking every time you go to sleep, do you?
don't tell me to act like a man.
because the thing about this is,
I would do that again for you in a second because he hurt you and because I'm in love with you.
and don't-- Don't look at me like that.
all right, don't. Because you know.
you've known forever.
it's not some big secret, all right?
let's not pretend that this was some great thing that we did.
and let's-- just don't tell me to become a man, all right?
because if that's your definition of a man, that's extremely sad.
all right?
look, gentlemen, I'm not here to make excuses.
I mean, everybody makes mistakes.
I made one. A big one.
and I'm sorry for that.
I should know better, my mom raised me better than that.
and I swear to you, on the Bible,
I promise you it won't happen again.
I wasn't raised that way. I know better.
but it was a mistake.
all I wanna do is play ball.
it's been my dream...
to make it to the NFL.
gentlemen, whether he plays at TMU or not,
Antoine Beltrane's gonna go the NFL.
that's my opinion.
he's either gonna go as a selfish, undisciplined punk, or you can allow us to shape him into what I believe he could be.
the problem's systemic.
it's a culture in football that's been allowed to have a life of its own.
it's no great secret.
I mean, he's not the only prima donna.
the fact of the matter is, we're asking for one year to drill some sense into the kid.
take away his iPhone. Take away his cars,
his ridiculous jewelry, and all the other crap.
and we make his life miserable for a season.
he's gonna be representing us, and I propose that our responsibility lies in doing better by Antoine Beltrane.
okay, see, with this my grandma likes to have newspapers, magazines, 'cause then she can read it.
one time I had a client who never threw anything away.
she was crushed to death under a pile of newspapers.
it that what you want, Matt? - No.
I can't live here unless it's clean.
okay.
we, that means you, should install a guard rail on the steps.
the thing we have to be careful of at her age is falling down.
and we're all going to have dinner together from now on.
okay, look, that's great. But what about her mind?
like, how are we gonna help... - Yeah, she's a little cuckoo.
she needs structure. She needs the tv off.
she needs crossword puzzles and walks and conversation.
okay, but-- whoa, hey, where are you going?
you people may have a mildew problem.
okay, look, this is my room, so...
did you draw this?
Yeah. Can I have it back, please?
what's the matter? It's good.
Thanks, but this is my room, so I think...
it's kind of depressing. You need some new curtains.
curtains? - How old are these sheets?
I don't know. - Help me move the bed.
no, we're not moving the-- no.
really, Matt?
haven't you heard of the internet?
Yeah, that's funny. That's funny, thanks.
I mean...
baby, you are hot.
Hey, Jules, come here and feel her, tell me if you think she's hot.
um, I really don't know anything about babies.
I'm sorry.
but Lois is outside waiting, so I really gotta go.
well, be home by 10:00, please.
all right, I love you.
love you.
Gracie, now, don't do this to.
yeah?
coach, you wanted to see me?
Ah, come on in, Taylor.
three games. - Sir?
Antoine Beltrane's only gonna be out three games.
well... that's good.
you're damn right it is.
he said you put on quite a show up there.
he also said that you hollered at him pretty good.
he kind of has that effect on people.
I bet you were one hell of a high school coach, Taylor.
I appreciate that, coach.
thank you.
how are you doing? - I'm doing good.
so have you made it a point of stalking me or something?
no.
just a lucky coincidence.
what are you doing?
I am debugging my friend's windshield.
no, I mean tonight.
what are you all dressed up for?
Oh, um, it's the big Panther pep rally.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, man, that sounds like fun.
Yeah, you have no idea.
I'm sure I don't.
well, you know what?
why don't you hop in?
I'll take you in the most majestic vehicle on earth.
come on, really.
I'll give you a ride.
okay.
I just gotta go tell Lois, though.
Yeah.
we're happy to have you all come out here.
and we especially wanna thank you for coming out to my ranch here tonight.
we really, really appreciate it.
and now the minute you've all been waiting for, you guys!
it's time to meet the 2006
Dillon high school State champions!
hey baby, y'all ready for some Smash ball?
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I used to have a place like this once, too, but I sold it for this van.
so this is how you guys throw a party.
let's just say that football isn't lost on Dillon.
well, hey, it was nice seeing you again.
Yeah. Thanks for the ride. - It was good stuff.
um, next time you wanna...
you can call me sometime.
I'm sorry, did I miss your thing?
Yeah.
doesn't matter. It's the Smash show, anyway.
look, I think we really need to talk.
okay.
talk.
I just think that... That maybe we've changed or something.
the point is, it's me. It's not you.
you didn't do anything.
I know I didn't do anything.
I know it's not me.
I know it's
I know it's the Swede.
no, it's not the Swede.
but how about just be honest with me?
just tell me the truth.
it's just...
it's the Swede, it's my parents, it's me feeling trapped.
it's me turning into my mom.
it's just... I don't know.
nothing seems right anymore.
and I just really need some space.
Oh, Lester.
Yeah, no, Garrity
Garrity Mortors is not good enough.
it's not wholesome.
this is wholesome.
this is Lester's wholesome trophy room.
didn't even shoot one of these damn animals. Probably.
and here is Mr. Lester out there.
working that hillbilly.
work that old ridge runnin' hillbilly mouth breather.
so, there's 14 seconds left, rain's coming down hard.
Jimmy Carter's the President, the country is depressed. Dillon is depressed.
by God, it's time to win the State championship.
TT's time for Buddy Garrity to get this thing done,
you know what I'm saying?
it's like... it's...
Lester, come over here. You gotta hear this.
this is the State championship game. 14 seconds left.
it's gotta be a run-pass option.
okay.
you got Speeze on that side. I got Nippy on that side.
let me get that. - No, I'm telling the story!
so I'm in the center. I got Billy right here, and I go back.
so I remember this. Tomahawk, run pass over!
sorry, ma'am. Excuse me, I'm sorry.
that's enough, now. - Get your hands off me!
you want some of me, boy? I will dough pop you right now!
you want me? Come on! Let's go. Let's go.
you need to just take it easy. - Let's go, boy!
Lester, do you want some of me now boy?
I got him.
it's fine. Riggo.
it's Riggins. Tim Riggins right here, baby. State champion.
state champion,
Lester never played.
it's all right.
I think I lost, Riggo.
I never lost in my life.
I have lost my family.
now I lost football.
what's going on?
what is he, drunk?
I don't know, Lyla. Maybe he's had one too many.
what do you think?
go. I got it.
I can do this. You must be loving this.
I got it. - Why would I love this?
I don't know. Just go, please.
you want me to leave? - Just go!
I got it. Get up, please.
it's spinning, it's spinning, - I love you. - Okay, dad, I need you to get up, okay?
I love you.
my head is spinnin'.
can you help me, please?
please.
there we go. - This is it? This is mine?
this is your barn, huh?
I love you. - There we go.
I love you.
Where's your bed, dad? - I'm sorry.
it's in here.
gotta roll you over, dad.
been here before.
all right, I got it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, guys. Thanks.
good night, champ. - I just wanted to play in a game...
I love you both.
why is everything always falling apart?
believe me, I've seen a few drunks in my day and he's not one of 'em.
he's not.
he's just sad, that's all.
he made his bed.
how you doing?
I'm okay.
you?
I'm great.
you better go.
you probably have a three-way to get to or something.
good night, Lyla.
all right, Tammy, make sure she's getting enough fluids.
offer her formula after you breastfeed.
and she needs to eat once every hour, okay?
maybe you and your husband can take shifts.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
she's gonna be fine. - Okay.
do you have anybody you can call?
maybe you shouldn't drive yourself home.
babe, she's fine. I swear.
the doctor brought her fever right down.
and she's starting to sleep now.
she's nice and quiet.
no, I don't want you running home.
you just stay. Sit tight where you are.
I don't want you coming back here, honey.
honey, I'm fine, I swear.
and she's good.
it's trip to the emergency room.
you know how many times Julie got dragged over here?
all right, I love you, baby.
I promise.
okay, all right. I love you so much.
Bye.
Hey.
Hey, Glen.
thank you for coming.
you-- are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
so she's waking up on you.
I'm sorry.
you're so sweet.
I'm sorry, I know it's late.
no, you know, it's fine. I wasn't doing anything.
you're so sweet, and I didn't have anybody else to call.
thank you very much.
I really appreciate it. You're real nice.
I'm sorry I was kind of a bitch to you.
I'm just a little emotional at the moment.
you weren't a bitch to me at all.
it's fine. It's really no big deal.
you're so sweet. Thank you.
you have everything? - I think so, yeah.
okay, let's go.
okay, sweetheart.
that's a beautiful baby. - Thank you.
Hey, you know, this might not be any of my business.
I'm not trying to step over the line, but this whole ordeal, this living apart from your husband thing?
what was the point of that exactly?
I don't know.
that was just my idea.
it was just a stupid idea.
how did you get in here?
I'm glad he's dead.
God, I...
you know, he wasn't gonna stop.
he was just gonna keep on doing that to me.
you know, maybe something's wrong with me, but I am...
I am so glad he's dead.
I just, um...
I wish I was the one who killed him.
don't-- Don't say that.
no. - Don't.
you are the best guy- I have ever known-- - Stop
no, and if anything happens to you because of me,
I would never forgive myself.
I am so sorry.
Oh, nah. Don't be sorry.
there's nothing to be sorry about.
it's all right. We're gonna be fine.
stop.
we're gonna be okay. Okay?
we're gonna be okay.
No!
come here. Come here now.
no.
you're the Iast one.
I've killed all the others.
it'II be easier for you than it was for Jason.
why are you doing this?
you need to be punished for what you did to him.
I didn't do anything. - You let him drown.
Jason was my son.
I didn't do anything.
no. No.
no. Please.
you shouId have been watching him.
every minute.
my special, special boy.
they must be punished, Jason, for what they did to you.
for what they did to me.
kill for Mother.
I'm serious.
you gotta watch out for mountain Iions. They're aII over.
mountain Iions? - We'II be fine. They're afraid of fire.
dude, shut the fuck up. I'm caIIing buIIshit.
Richie's gonna caII buIIshit.
buIIshit! - Richie's caIIing buIIshit.
I'm not buIIshitting. - BuIIshit.

dude, there's one right there! - Nice try.
I am more afraid to be eaten by mosquitoes.
Hey, you wanna sIap that ass one more time for Daddy?
did Daddy Iike that? - Yeah, Daddy does Iike it. A Iot.
Whitney? Where are you right now?
I'm here. - Are you?

Hey, are you reading that right? - I'm reading it right.

no, we're not. Not everything shows up on GPS, Richie.
a sign said there was a mine here. Did that come up?
no. We're cIose, I think.
you think? Dude, you don't know how to use this thing.
it's aImost dark. Do you know where it is?
look, I didn't pIant this shit, Richie, okay?
I got this tip from a secondhand source. We shouId be cIose.
look, we're gonna stop here.
tomorrow morning, you and me, we get up at dawn. We go, we find the crop.

perfect. We'II camp here.
Hey. Do you know how much money we're gonna make seIIing this weed?

Oh, jeez. - He went to camp around here.

Oh, my God. Babies have more space in the uterus.
Hey, Lawrence, how about a IittIe heIp?
dude, you're gonna ask the one bIack guy to pump the gas for you? Shit.
okay. NoIan.
how about I pay, you pump?
sure, man. Hey, I give a wicked bIow job too.
okay, weII, um, we'II try that out Iater.
whoa. Hey, bro, that's- - I have a heart murmur. What are you doing?
thank you. - Where'd you get a knapsack Iike that?
it was a present, actuaIIy. But I'm Iooking for my sister.
she's gone missing, about a month and a haIf ago.
my parent's cabin is stocked. You think you're actuaIIy gonna get Iaid?
your parents do not have Combos or Funyuns.
they definiteIy don't have Fritos. And this is...
...not for sex.
what are you gonna use them for? - It's an experiment.
okay. So just get behind me. I'm not gonna pay for that shit.
wouId you mind if I maybe just put a fIyer in the window or something?
Oh, I heard about that. That's sad.
if it was up to me, you couId waIIpaper the whoIe pIace with them...
...but the owner makes the ruIes.
and he's a reaI:
weII, is he here? Maybe I couId taIk to him. Maybe if he understands the situation
TRENT: Are you gonna buy something?
I mean, you've been up here for quite a whiIe yapping, so...
sure. Yeah.
Thanks. So we have two waters and some gas.
two waters and some gas.
guess I'm an asshoIe.
you okay, bro? Is everything good?
Yeah, everything's fine. Thanks.
but I'm not your bro.
so you don't wanna be friends? You don't wanna hang out?
let it go, Trent. - It's not me. This guy's being a dick.
Yeah, it's me. ObviousIy, I'm the one being a dick.
sir, thank you very much anyways.
Yep. - I'm sorry.
thank you.
seat beIts.
weIcome back, CIay.
you mean that, Officer Bracke?
son, I know you think we're not on your side...
...that we're just a bunch of dumb country hicks out here.
I put two 1 0- year veterans on that case.
we did three dozen interviews and ran a county- wide search for your sister.
you know how many thousands of peopIe disappear every year...
...even in this state aIone?
but there's no evidence that anything happened to Whitney...
...or any of those other kids at CrystaI Lake. There's no car, no witnesses.
nothing.
one of those kids was her boyfriend, right?
right.
weII...
...they probabIy just took off together.
our mother just died of cancer. Did I teII you that?
no, sir. - WeII, she did.
she was sick for a Iong time...
...and Whitney took care of her every singIe day.
and then my sister didn't show up for the funeraI.
see, you just don't know my sister. That's not possibIe.
weII...
...She's not here, son.
might wanna try Iooking somepIace eIse. That's what the other famiIies are doing.
can you say that with a- - ? - Wow.
can you say that with a IittIe more hatred?
nice. - Shit.
sir LanceIot, thank you.
Oh, man down. - Take it easy, guys.
is anyone getting a signaI out here?
are you fucking with me? I got business I gotta do this weekend.
what business?
music. I'm trying to start a IabeI.
Oh, yeah? Like what kind? Like rap?
why you gotta go raciaI?
look, don't put me in a box, aII right?
what, because I'm bIack I can't Iisten to Green Day?
you're right, that was dumb. So, what kind of music?
here it is.
Oh, my God. - Yep.
aII right, we have two bedrooms upstairs. We've got one down.
someone can take the couch. It's comfy as heII.
Wow. - Nice, huh?
damn. - That is a fierce pussy.
it's a bobcat. It's my dad's first kiII.
I didn't think this Iong- ass car ride was gonna be worth it...
...but it's kind of worth it.
this is bigger than the dorm.
what can I say? Hey, take your feet off the tabIe, pIease.
so make yourseIves at home.
what do you wanna do first? - What do you wanna do?
Oh, weII...
I brought Sweet LuciIIe. I think you aII need to meet her.
LuciIIe? Baby, is that you?
Lawrence, you've been cheating. - No.
I saw you with a bowI the other night. - No, you
a bowI.
HeIIo?
HeIIo?
HeIIo?
HeIIo?
Christ.
I just wanted to ask you a question. - Hush.
I wanted to ask you if maybe you've seen somebody.
my sister.
she came camping up around here with some friends...
...and she's gone missing.
she ain't missing. She's dead.
what? - PeopIe go missing around here...
...they're gone for good.
outsiders come, they don't know where to waIk.
they bring troubIe.
we just wanna be Ieft aIone.
and so does he.
so does who?
ma'am, pIease. So does who?
nolan: You, baby. It's aII you. - Stop peer- pressuring me.
Oh, no. - Oh, shit.
Yes! - My fucking eye!
guys, watch the fIoor, aII right, pIease? That's stained oak.
this is an outside game. Come on. - Wait, I got foam in my contact.
Hey. This is a great spot.
do you wanna go for a hike? Get some exercise?
that'd be nice, but, weII, I can't exactIy Ieave them here aIone.
what are you taIking about?
have you seen what they're doing inside?
crazy. Some drunken hoodIums.
HoodIums? - HoodIums.
what do you think they're gonna do?
I mean, steaI the deer head? - You're right.
how are they gonna puII off the getaway? We're Ieaving in the same car.
come on. Do you want some exercise?
because I have this reaIIy great move that I've been practicing...
...and I need someone to practice it with.
very charming. Very charming.
Oh, come on.
you wanna go on a hike? - You Iike hikes now?
I Iove hikes. - I knew it.
wiII you get me a beer?
excuse me.
sir?
Hey! - Oh, shit. Jesus.
sorry.
Jesus Christ.
you're fucking Iucky there, stretch.
came that cIose to hitting the start button on the whoop- ass machine, boy.
look, I didn't mean to startIe you. I was trying to get your attention.
this is Mr. Garikes' property.
you're Iucky that oId mummy fart didn't put buckshots in your ass.
somebody's been steaIing his fucking kerosene too.
look, I just came in here to ask you something, okay?
I'm Iooking for this girI. Have you seen her?
she's been missing for about a month.
I wish I had, man.
I ain't seen her, though. - Thanks.
take care. - You too.
shit. Hey, hey, hey.
I forgot, did you wanna buy some weed?
seriousiy, I found a fucking shit ton of it growing out there. A IittIe busheI.
seII you some. - No. Thanks.
you sure? I got a whoIe bunch of it. - I'm good.
you sure?
it's your fucking Ioss, dude.
it'II fuck your shit up, boy.
good times...
...fucker.
just reIax, okay? These guys are your guests.
if you're...
if you're not comfortabIe having them here, then why did you invite them?
so they couId admire your pIace?
no. I just wanted to have a good weekend. You know?
Hey, guys. Wanna check out the other side of the Iake with us?
um... You know what? It's getting, you know...
no. That's okay. It's... It's okay. It's getting kind of Iate.
Yeah. - Okay.
take my truck.
nice. - I trust you.
can you do me a favor? WiII you take the gas cans to the boat?
it's on the south end of the Iake. Just take a right onto Town Road.
take a right. - Okay, and then?
why don't you just type " boat " into the nav?
TechnoIogy, right? - See you.
have fun. - Later.
don't drive my boat.
I'm the onIy one that drives the boat, okay?
aye, aye, captain.
damn straight.
what does that say about me that the second Trent said...
... " Don't take my boat out, " it was guaranteed that I wouId.
it means you're a sociopath.
now, what does it say about me that I find that hot?
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm Iooking for my sister and...
Hey.
no Iuck? - No. No, not yet.
may I? - Yeah.
thank you. - Sure.
she's pretty.
Thanks.
do you wanna come in for a second, grab a drink?
uh...
I don't think your boyfriend wouId Iike that too much.
don't worry. He'II be fine.
and here we have the stoned American maIe, foraging for food.
Thanks.
this shouId be interesting.
Hey, Trent, you remember...
Yeah. Of course I remember CIay.
why is he in my house?
Hey, new guy. Beer?
no, no. He's gotta get going. You got fIyers to pass out, right?
Yeah.
right.
look, if you're hungry, we- - - Okay.
look, CIay, obviousIy she's just trying to be nice.
but you can't stay here. No offense, but this is a private party.
I don't know you. - No, you don't know me.
that's so funny, I just said that.
like two seconds ago, that I don't know you.
I wouId probabIy Ieave soon before I get pissed off and, you know...
yeah? - Yeah.
what happens then?
Hey, Iook. Take it easy, Trent, aII right? I'II just- - I'II waIk you out.
Yeah.
Jenna. Jenna, come on. Where you going?
JENNA: Sorry about that.
that's aII right. It's his house, you know?
Where's your car?
I do not have a car, but I do have her.
nice. - Thanks.
this thing runs? - Yeah. Yeah, it runs.
so where you off to next?
I haven't been to the other side of the Iake, so I was gonna go check that out.
do you want some company? - I'd Iove some company.
what's up, beaver bear?
it's a big motherfucker, huh?
fuck, yeah.
you hot bitch.
let Daddy have a IittIe Iick.
you Iike that, bitch? You know you do.
what the fuck was that?
don't smoke my weed, motherfucker.
somebody better not be steaIing the kerosene up there.
shit.
it's just you, baby.
it's been a Iong time, Gina.
you remember that speciaI night we had?
you remember when you took my virginity?
you're sexy.
you're stiII tight as ever. I'm gonna fucking pound you so hard.
what the fuck?
what the- - ?
that shit ain't fucking right, dude. What the fuck?
you think we shouId take the boat out? He's gonna find out.
I knew it. - What?
you're inhibited. You taIk a big game, but inside you're just a scared IittIe girI.
Oh, reaIIy? Oh, okay, fine.
you wanna find out who's reaIIy scared? Let's do it.
aII right. Let's go.
so you and your sister must be pretty cIose.
we were pretty cIose when we were younger. We kind of drifted.
I mean, I baiIed when I was 1 7, and she stayed with my mom.
she kind of had to, I guess.
I don't know, she's aIways been the responsibIe one.
so when's the Iast time you taIked to her?
about six months ago. We got in a fight, actuaIIy.
she caIIed and said she wanted to see me, said she was counting on me...
...and I never showed.
excuse me.
what is that?
aII right, you ready? - Ready. Let's do it.
Yeah. Oh, shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
pick it, pick it.
Oh, you Iike the baIIs in your hand, huh?
which one? Which one is it? Is that the one?
those feeI good, don't they? - That's the one.
shoot.
fuck.
one of you has gotta shoot the boot.
that's you, babe.
are you serious? - Yeah.
you missed. I've been carrying you the entire game.
come on, baby. - Drink up, drink up, drink up.
shoot the boot, shoot the boot, shoot the boot.
shoot the boot.
fuck that. I'm not drinking out of your sweaty- ass sneaker.
you Iost 1 0 in a row. Shoot.
my house, my ruIes. I'm not drinking that shit.
fine. - Oh, no.
to aII the feIching... - No. No.
...weIching... - Yes.
...pussies of the worId.
that's disgusting.
Oh!
Yeah.
what are you doing, NoIan?!
Olivia Dunham FBI
they are calling these events a pattern
as someone out is doing experiment, only the whole world is a lab
anybody you need you can have
his name is Walter Bishop
my father
he worked out at Harvard
he was part of classified US army experimental programe
in the area called Fringe Science
you are telling me, my father is Dr. Frankstan?
so much happened here, so much is about Brooklyn New York
can I get you some coffee?
roast beef sandwich on a roll.
meat raw as possible.
room temperature water.
no ice. -- Gotcha.
do you have jalapenos? -- I think he does.
11 of those, please.
on the side.
11. You got it.
what is that?
that language, is that, like, Korean or something?
no.
good. I had Asian studies at CUNY.
thought I really missed something.
move. Move now! Right now.
it has arrived.
Boston Massachusetts 150 grams of sucrose,
maintained at 70 degrees fahrenheit for 120 hours.
30 milliliters at 80 degrees...
what formula are you rattling off at 3: 00 in the morning?
the formula for root beer.
root beer.
that's what's so important
you couldn't stop yourself from broadcasting.
I haven't had it for ages.
I -- I thought I might make some in the lab tomorrow.
where are you going?
it occurs to me it might be easier to sleep in the tub.
a root beer float. Delicious.
next time, would you please drain the tub?
Oh, yes. Indeed.
federal Building
I know how to get there.
I need you to slow down.
her office is right up here.
I've been there before.
sir, you don't have clearance to walk here unescorted.
Peter. -- We need to talk.
is that okay with you?
do I have clearance to talk to her?
it's okay. I got it.
come with me.
where is your father?
Walter is at the hotel.
but don't worry, your agents are standing guard.
not that it matters, 'cause the man is unconscious.
he was awake till 5: 00 in the morning,
reciting the chemical compositions of his favorite beverages to me.
that was right after he finished lecturing me on how I'd squandered my above-average intellect and my substantial education,
all while he was standing there naked.
because he prefers the breeze.
well, your living arrangements are temporary.
we're finding you an apartment so that
Olivia, don't bother.
I wanted to help. I felt bad.
I still feel bad about what happened to you.
but the truth is, you don't need me here.
that isn't the truth. -- It is.
things are happening here.
strange things that need investigating,
that connect somehow to the insane work
that Walter was doing way back when,
but he's the one with the answers.
you need him. I'm just a babysitter.
Peter, you decipher what he says.
things that other people can't even follow.
no, not any more.
anybody can do that.
there's nothing special about me.
you're his son.
that's not the only thing.
I don't do well staying in one place.
you know that.
this isn't the job for me.
if you leave, so does he.
Really?
you're telling me that if the federal government wants to get Walter Bishop out of a mental institution,
they can't do that without the consent of his son?
it's your father.
he's made it very clear that if you leave,
he won't cooperate with our investigations.
I don't believe it.
he would rather go back to St. Claire's than work here without you.
he said that more than once.
was he wearing clothes at the time?
good morning. Hello.
hello.
morning.
yesterday, there was an explosion at a construction site in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
a crane collapsed.
left three dead, two dozen injured.
the public was told that it was a gas main explosion,
which, technically, is the truth.
it's what caused the explosion I want you to see.
we had it transported here late last night.
we've got NSA and CDC gathering data.
but Dr. Bishop,
I wanted you to see this as soon as possible.
what is it?
it's why you're here.
we don't know.
it just fell from the sky?
it came from underground.
the thing blasted through an unused subway tunnel into a gas main.
underground.
cameo rest right on the surface.
as if someone had carefully placed it there.
solid iridium.
we think so, yes.
subsonic vibrations?
at two megahertz, and then again at four.
this thing is vibrating?
Dr. Bishop, do you have an idea what this may be?
an idea, yes.
do you feel like sharing?
no. It's too early.
this isn't the first time one of these has shown up.
1987
at Quantico.
Colonel Jacobson was in charge of the investigation.
Henry Jacobson?
spoke to him myself this morning.
he's expecting a visit.
said he is looking forward to seeing you again.
what do you wanna do?
what kind of man would take off on you
the minute a can of magic space soup arrives?
who says it came from space?
it's a joke, Walter. -- Oh.
thank you for staying.
this is the last one, Olivia.
then I'm gone.
we need to get this back to the lab.
we can't risk transferring this to the university.
we'd rather you stay...
if you require my perspicacity such as it exists,
then there are certain fundamental requirements,
not the least of which is access to my equipment,
my lab...
Roseville Virginia
I was hoping I'd have an excuse to see you again.
it's good to see you.
it's been more than a year since she died.
it's still difficult.
I suppose it always will be.
Jessica took care of the house.
hell, she took care of everything.
I apologize for what has to be horrible coffee.
no, it's delicious.
I -- I know you lost someone too.
my condolences.
it's not easy losing a partner.
I know agent Scott and you were close.
what can you tell me about Ouantico?
1987?
master sergeant Stuart Malick.
he was at his post at the marine base on the night of June 22.
his job was to watch the motion sensors,
perimeter security,
to ensure that there was no breach at the base.
except on that night, the sensors went nuts.
what we found was this.
metallic cylinder, 24 inches tall, 12 inches in diameter.
he assumed it fell from the sky.
that perhaps it was a piece of a satellite.
except it wasn't.
stranger still, although it seemed to be
a solid pie of hard metal,
it was vibrating.
at two megahertz.
then again at four.
there's another?
where is this one?
still at Quantico?
I was called in to investigate.
we determined it was transmitting something.
a signal that we couldn't decode.
48 hours after we found it,
there was an explosion unlike anything I'd ever seen.
it went through the floor
to the basement below.
it exploded down.
and was gone.
I'll give you my files, whatever you need.
but this was a weird one, Olivia.
and if it's happening again,
as a friend,
I'd ask you to stay as far away from this thing as you can.
and what exactly is this?
in time, my dear.
Hello, sir, can I help you?
code red, code red.
we have a breach in sector eight.
you.
where is it?
agent Dunham.
Hello?
Hello?
Olivia.
Hello?
Olivia.
John?
dispatch.
this is agent Dunham.
I need a call traced from my cell.
it just came in.
please hold.
we have no record of any calls in the last three hours.
I'm sorry.
okay. Thank you.
harvard University
the precision with which this object was constructed is inspiring.
down to the molecular bonds.
I sure hope that a gigantic metallic suppository is not the pinnacle of human achievement.
what is it?
let me ask you a question.
if I tried reverse psychology,
like, if I just said to you right now, "Walter, don't tell me what that is."
would that work?
many years ago, I worked on project Thor.
the department of defense wanted a subterranean torpedo,
a missile which could, in theory,
be shot from anywhere in the world
through the earth's core and hit its target on the other side.
I know for a fact that that is ridiculous.
open your mind, son,
or someone may open it for you.
even that doesn't make any sense.
the cylinder could be any number of things,
none of which I am prepared to discuss.
great, well, I am glad I stuck around for this.
I don't believe it.
what?
look.
it's one of the photos from Jacobson's file.
him. Remember?
the bald guy.
no, who is he?
that's the point.
Olivia, you're starting to sound like Walter.
there are many things I'm not good at,
too many, but one thing I can do,
that I've always been able to do,
that game, concentration.
memory. Connecting things.
putting them together.
see.
two weeks ago at the hospital.
that's him.
no way.
can I help you?
still photograph from the crime scene at Quantico, 1987.
look.
he was there. Look at this.
less than two weeks ago at the hospital in Quincy.
it's the same guy.
and he looks the same.
and he was there with us.
what?
come with me.
excuse us, please.
it took us a year to spot him.
you did it in three weeks.
who the hell is this guy?
that is one excellent question.
you've run him through every database?
of course. -- And there's nothing on him?
nothing at all? -- No positive ID.
we've recorded him at over three dozen scenes,
all of which relate to the pattern.
how?
Why? What is he doing?
what it looks like he's doing.
he's watching. Observing.
which is why we refer to him as the observer.
but what he wants and why he's there, we don't know.
and he was there the other day?
in New York at the construction site?
this is Broyles.
when did it happen?
okay, turn it on.
what is that?
it's called sound.
I know that, thank you. What's the point?
I need to compare the numbers, confirm my suspicions.
compare them to what?
suspicions of what?
Astrid Farnsworth.
I'll explain later.
no, I want you to explain right now.
I want to know what the hell this tin can is.
Peter?
it's Olivia.
Hello?
there's been an attack, Peter.
the team at the warehouse is dead.
what? Who did it?
I don't know, but we're moving that thing to a secure facility.
I'm on my way.
got it.
Walter, whatever the hell that thing is,
you should have never brought it here.
why do you say this?
has someone come for it?
why would you ask that?
have they? -- Yes.
then we need to keep this safe.
we need something -- something very important.
what? -- Aluminum foil.
Why? -- Trust me.
no, thank you. -- Damn it!
must you always be such a smart ass?
I need the aluminum foil right now to shield the frequencies of the cylinder.
your life depends on it.
all our lives depend on it.
go now.
I'm gonna go get you your aluminum foil,
and then when I get back, you're gonna tell me
what the hell it is you think that thing does.
while you're out, if you see a chance to get me a root beer float,
that would be wonderful.
I'll see what I can do.
would you be a lamb and get me that syringe?
sure.
thank you.
I got the tin foil!
Astrid!
Astrid! Are you okay?
Astrid, look at me, Astrid.
Hey, focus, focus for a second.
where is Walter?
someone came to you.
think about her.
I know you were there.
the last time.
and she's come to you now.
think about that woman.
don't play with me.
now you tell me now,
or I'll do that again.
think.
see? That was easy.
bless you.
I haven't had a root beer float in 17 years.
And? How is it?
heavenly.
and earthly at the same time.
quite the connoisseur.
do you want some?
no, thank you.
I wouldn't taste much anyway.
17 years.
that's a long time to go without something you love.
where I've been, you lose track of time.
so much now to make up for.
thank you for hiding the beacon.
I can't touch it myself.
I know you have questions.
soon you'll have answers.
of course.
Dr. Walter Bishop, -- I'm forwarding his photo right now. -- I want surveillance posted outside his last known residence.
this is getting annoying.
please do not stand there and tell me
that you have no idea where your father
you're assuming I have any understanding of how that man's addled brain works.
you gave us the impression that you could handle him.
Hey, let's get something straight.
I didn't promise you anything.
I warned you from the word go.
agent Dunham.
thank god. Where?
we'll be right there.
Walter just got picked up, walking the median of I-95.
thank you.
if it's possible,
I would very much like my own clothes back.
let me explain how this works to you, Walter.
you can't inject a federal officer with sedatives,
steal government property,
and then escape from protective custody,
and then ask to be not treated like a criminal.
have you never taken anything that didn't belong to you because you knew it was the right thing to do?
this isn't about me.
maybe it is, Peter.
you took the cylinder.
do you remember that?
Yes, of course.
what would you like to know about it?
where is it? -- I can't tell you that.
but I can tell you that someone is coming to seek the cylinder.
thus, I had to hide it.
and I don't recall where or from whom.
we need you to remember.
it may be dangerous,
and we need to help keep people safe.
tell me what it is.
if I -- if I attempted to explain it,
you -- you might think me mad.
don't worry. There's no chance of that happening.
I believe there are only
another four hours in which I must keep the cylinder from those who are trying to get it,
a theory I have discussed with my friend, who agrees with me.
your friend?
um, he's a tall fellow, right?
pink, big fuzzy ears.
no, he's a man.
quite nice.
albeit extremely bald.
no eyebrows either.
it's disturbing, but you get accustomed to it.
you talked to him?
do you really think it's a good idea to feed into his delusions at this point?
Walter, who is he?
where can we find him?
Oh, you won't be able to find him.
of course not, 'cause he's in the seventh dimension.
he's shy.
though he wouldn't be any use to you.
he just observes.
Walter, you haven't talked to this man.
you've seen him in Olivia's photographs,
so cut out the gibberish
and just tell us where the cylinder is.
must you always be so small-minded?
damn it, don't be like her.
like your mother.
questioning my judgment.
I am not a child.
I will not be babied.
thank you for that.
that's exactly what I needed.
guilt relieved.
Olivia, I am very sorry, but I think you'll understand why I don't want to hang around any longer.
I upset him, didn't I?
where are we?
I couldn't tell you.
Walter's hiding something.
he's being as cryptic as ever.
he says he had to keep the cylinder safe.
that someone is looking for it.
welcome to the joys of Walter Bishop.
where did he take it?
you'll have to ask Walter. He won't tell me.
apparently, he had a meeting with a man matching the description of our friend.
the bald guy.
well, I know a lot of bald guys.
the observer.
are you saying Walter's saying he knows him?
I'm saying he's not cooperating.
I'm saying I'm confused.
Hey, man.
thanks for calling me back so fast.
look, don't start with me right now, okay?
well, guess what, I'm calling this time to ask for a favor too.
Nah, I need some work.
well, I don't really care.
as long as it puts some money in my pocket.
anywhere but Boston.
okay.
agent Dunham?
agent Farnsworth is on the phone.
I don't know. About an hour ago?
when he left, he was pretty upset with Walter.
maybe he just finally left.
no, there was a struggle here.
I'll check it out. Thanks, Astrid.
call Harvard campus security.
there's a closed-circuit camera outside countway library aimed at the kresge building.
I need footage going back two hours.
you don't work for big Eddie, do you?
look, I think you got the wrong guy.
what I'm saying is...
whatever it is you want, I don't think I'm gonna be able to give it to you.
no, no!
you have something I need.
tell me where it is.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'm going to ask you some questions.
please answer honestly.
what's the most pain you've ever felt in your life?
this was taken outside your lab.
have you ever seen this man before?
I don't believe so, no.
something's happened, yes?
something unfortunate. What is it?
I believe this man may have abducted Peter.
that's not -- no.
Peter will lead him to it.
to what? The cylinder?
Yes. -- How?
did you tell him where you put it?
no, of course not.
I don't need to.
you and your colleagues had the cylinder last.
where is it now?
I have no idea.
and even if I did,
you're the last person I would tell.
but you just did tell me.
your father hide it.
but you don't know where.
and yes, to answer your question, when this is over, I just might kill you.
it depends on a few things.
when was the last time your father kissed you?
I think that's your lamest question yet.
think about your father.
good.
now think about a time before he was sent away to the institution.
a happy time, a time when you still believed that your father loved you.
beside his car in your old house, does your father have any other hiding places?
answer the question.
does your father ha
thank you.
you just told me where the cylinder is.
come with me.
shame you never met him.
come on.
dig.
careful.
Hey, Olivia.
over here.
are you okay?
Yeah. He went that way. Go.
he's got a gun.
departure on schedule.
who the hell are you?
what is the cylinder?
you know what it is, don't you?
why is it here?
why now?
who are you?
apples, bananas, rhinoceros.
I want to hold your hand.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
do you really know my father?
did you talk to him this afternoon?
are you his friend?
Peter.
is he all right? -- He's fine.
he has a mild concussion, but he's gonna be fine.
thank you. That's wonderful news.
come on. I'm gonna take you back to your hotel.
if you don't mind,
there's something I'd like to do first.
what I did to you was very untrustworthy of me.
I never intended to harm you.
I was simply doing what was necessary to protect us all.
if it would help you feel a sense of retribution,
I would tell you to inject me too.
but I'd most likely enjoy it.
Hi, Peter Bishop, he was brought in about an hour ago.
excuse me.
are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
so did we recover the cylinder?
we dug out the hole, but there's no sign of it.
as soon as the sun comes up,
we'll bring in an excavator,
but somehow, I don't have an expectation we'll find it.
so it just disappeared.
we i. d. 'd the shooter.
John Mosley.
wanted for a double homicide in Seattle last month.
a few drug-related felonies before that.
Seattle.
came a long way to try and get that thing.
another in a long line of questions.
I should get back.
as you can imagine, there are some interagency fires to quash.
NSA considered that device their personal property.
they're looking for an explanation.
so I'll see you tomorrow?
Yeah.
you ready to get out of here?
something happened out there tonight, Olivia.
the pattern that Broyles refers to,
I always thought it was nonsense.
inexplicable things happen every single day.
it does not mean that there's any deeper significance.
I know this is gonna sound insane.
Yeah, I know it sounds insane,
but that man out there in the woods,
he knew me.
and I don't know how, but he was inside my head.
he knew what I was going to say before I said it.
the man I shot?
no, the other guy, the bald guy.
from your photos. Mr. no brows?
Peter, I didn't see anyone.
you know me well enough now to know that these are the last words I would ever expect to to be saying,
but what if walter is right?
what if this is just the beginning?
listen, you took a pretty bad blow to the head.
you think I did this to myself?
no, I just
I was wrong to -- to demand that you stay here.
Walter is not your responsibility.
as you've always said,
this was just supposed to be temporary.
you have your life.
Olivia, did you hear what I just said?
I mean, I'm a fairly open-minded guy,
but there are things happening here
that I can't even begin to explain.
and I am not going anywhere until I can.
in that case, you might want this.
your credentials have been approved.
civilian consultant
to the department of homeland security.
does this mean I don't need an escort to come into the federal building anymore?
Yeah.
will it get me out of speeding tickets?
maybe.
so let me tell you about my day, Walter.
I was abducted, tortured,
had two wires shoved up my nose
that were connected to a machine I've never seen before.
but maybe the strangest part of the day
is that somehow, without talking,
I was able to answer a question
that I didn't have the answer to.
where I buried the capsule?
how did I know that, Walter?
I didn't know that.
I didn't know where the cylinder is buried
you know it, son, because I know it.
no, I didn't know because you didn't tell me.
I didn't have to.
you must adjust the way you consider communications, ideas.
ideas can be absorbed through osmosis.
through proximity.
do you remember the night of the accident when you were young?
I was driving-- -- of course, I remember.
your mother was at home.
of course, I remember. Thanksgiving dinner.
she was anxious for us to get there,
join everyone.
when the car went off the road,
the ice was so thick that it held the vehicle
for what must have been two minutes.
what does this have to do with what happened today?
I regained consciousness,
I saw your body contorted horribly,
and I reached for you.
but the ice broke.
and we sank into that dark water.
and then you swam to shore and saved us both.
I know.
no.
I was unable to control my limbs in that icy water.
it wouldn't respond.
I was incapable of saving you.
or myself.
we were dead, Peter, you and I.
until someone grabbed me.
and we were going up.
we were saved, both of us,
by a man that I had never met.
a man that shouldn't have been there at all.
he pulled us to the shore.
I remembered that he was bald,
that he had no eyebrows.
and as he set us down in the snow,
I recalled his stare,
standing there in his suit soaking wet,
seemingly indifferent to the cold.
it was as if he knew my thoughts before I did.
as if he were side my head.
without speaking, he made it clear that he would need me one day.
a return favor, so to speak.
and this is it.
today, what happened with the capsule,
I'm not sure how I knew about the vibrations, the composition.
but then when I tested it myself, heard the vibrations, felt them,
it was as if an envelope had been opened
and I could finally read my instructions.
instantly, I knew I had to protect the capsule for him.
who they are, what they want
as a man of science, I share your frustration in not having these answers.
but what I know is that you are sitting here now...
my son...
alive.
I know you must think me insane.
not nearly as much as you might think.
Hello, Liv.
tell me about The First People.
start with why those books seem to indicate that you wrote them.
then move on to what the device is intended for.
whatever is happening between the two universes...
whatever our fate is,
I'm right at the center of it.
when I touched that device, it came alive in my hands.
how can you expect me to ignore that?
I asked you not to work on that device in my lab.
you're playing with fire.
they're working on it on the other side.
we need to understand exactly what it does.
you are the mother of my grandchild.
did you get the sample?
department of defense
so where do we stand?
we've doubled the thickness of the lead shielding around the machine.
good. You let me know as soon as the Faraday cage is completed.
I'm told they're almost done.
you really think this is all necessary?
we're standing underneath a giant lightning rod.
it's unclear what kind of electrostatic discharge the device may give off.
good morning.
if you'll all excuse us, please.
based on Olivia Dunham's DNA profile, we were able to identify 23 chromosomes your grandson inherited from his mother and strip them out.
of course, that leaves us with only half of Peter's full genetic profile.
but hopefully that's enough to activate the machine.
how long before we're ready? - It should be within the hour.
sir, history may never fully know what we've done here.
how we've saved our universe.
I'm proud to be a part of it.
oppenheimer saved us too.
but at what cost?
he couldn't bear the nightmares...
the screams of all the innocents he had killed.
now, I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.
only in our case, that really is true.
we destroyed their world to save ours.
may God have mercy on us.
accord NEW YORK
Hey, Joe, come in.
you know what time it is, don't you, Rich?
listen, you've got to get up here.
6: 00 A. M.
that means I'm having my breakfast right now.
this is serious. You've gotta get up here.
something's spooking the sheep. They're going crazy.
all right. I'm on my way.
I just hit a swarm of locusts!
it's like the blessed apocalypse.
Yeah, well, the sheep are acting like it is.
I tried to round 'em up, get 'em back to the barn, but they won't budge.
gimme your walkie.
everybody listen up.
this is Joe.
I need all hands in the north field.
what is that?
damn it!
some days you've got it, Donnie, some days you don't.
I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.
good morning, Olivia.
I didn't know you were spending the night. What a lovely surprise.
Oh, no, the surprise is all mine.
I am going to pop another mushroom frittata into the oven.
I got some morels from the market with the biggest caps you've ever seen.
sure.
Olivia. - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
you should get some slippers for when you stay over here.
this house can get very chilly.
[Laughs] Right. Okay.
find some magic mushrooms and they put them in the stew.
what time is it?
it's 6: 30 in the morning. Oh, God.
and, uh, your father is walking around the house naked.
Oh, yeah, it's Tuesday.
he always cooks naked on Tuesdays.
is that safe?
Uh-uh. It's not pretty either.
but you get used to it. - Hmm.
I could get used to this.
this is my favorite time of day.
the sunrise, when the world is full of promise.
well, that's not.
Oh, my.
a ranch foreman and a farmhand are confirmed missing, along with an entire herd of sheep.
over 500 head gone.
how is that possible? - You tell me.
no hurricanes or tornadoes in the area.
barometers remained steady.
there's an army base about twenty miles from here.
I thought that too, but we ruled out weapons testing.
whatever happened here, we didn't cause it.
I wouldn't bet the farm on that.
when did this happen? Do we have a time on the incident?
6: 05 A. M.give or take a few minutes depending on the individual report.
that man owns the neighboring property.
he was outside when it happened. I'd like you to question him.
sure.
Peter! A hand! Come quickly!
this granite contains quartz crystals.
my electrometer.
quartz crystals only develop an electrical potential when they're put under physical pressure.
extreme physical pressure caused by a major gravitational event.
highly charged, of course.
and I suppose you have a theory?
I believe that a vortex appeared above this field, consuming everything in its path.
my worst fear is realized...
our world is breaking down around us.
well, let's not jump to conclusions. - I'm not.
even if that is true, Walter, why now?
what would trigger a vortex?
that's a good question.
this is clearance Double A.
I want all unnecessary personnel sent home.
I've issued the bulletin.
all right. How many on duty when it started?
four. It was a skeletal crew.
and we're sure it wasn't tampered with?
it wasn't. We reviewed the footage.
with all due respect, there's no way.
get me Agent Broyles.
Yes. Hello, Nina.
Phillip, the machine came on.
can you hear me?
I can hear you. Go on.
the machine came on by itself, without Peter.
when?
6: 02 A. M. There was no warning.
is that noise the machine?
tell Walter it's on. He needs to know.
what do you mean, the machine is activated?
apparently, it powered up by itself.
it appears our assumptions were wrong.
what time did this happen?
just after 6: 00 this morning.
of course. That's the reason.
the machine activated just after 6: 00, just minutes before the vortex opened.
so you think it caused this?
Yes, and if it's the end of the world...
this is just the beginning.
harvard UNIVERSITY - Anything? - This is worthless.
up until now, we've been operating under the assumption that I was somehow the power source for this machine, but clearly that was wrong.
you're the only one that the machine's responded to.
you've said so yourself.
and yet it turned itself on while I was 200 miles away.
so how do we explain that? - I think I understand.
the machine's magnetic field is warped in a pattern I've only seen one other time.
the typewriter that the other Olivia used to communicate with the other side.
what are you suggesting, Walter?
quantum entanglement. - I'm afraid so.
you think the Walternate turned the machine on over there?
which triggered a sympathetic response from the one over here. Yes, it makes sense.
but how? I mean, how could he do that without Peter?
there's not much we do know for sure.
I just got off the phone with Broyles.
three more reported incidents.
massive colonies of bats were spotted above the New Jersey turnpike.
mini quakes in Florida.
and in Newton, thirty acres of woodland completely decimated.
all organic life just dead and desiccated in a matter of hours.
the blight.
at this point, I believe that the events will begin to increase exponentially.
and there's no way to stop it.
he's won.
Walternate has won.
Oh! It's chilly!
well, Dr. Marna said two weeks, and he's three weeks old yesterday.
you worry too much.
besides, the fresh air's gonna do him some good.
look at him, just kind of sizing up the world.
he's alert, that one.
you know, it is kind of windy. So will you humor me?
here. Oh, nice and warm.
Oh. - Let me.
see, it's supposed to be my day off.
not the first time we've heard that.
fringe events liberty island
we'll be okay if you have to go.
heh! You are such a nugget.
Oh, I know. Mwah!
I love you.
all right, I'll call you when I have some idea of what time I'm gonna be home.
okay. Don't worry, I'll keep him safe.
you just keep the rest of us safe. - Okay.
the lookers have detected a spatial discontinuity.
okay. How bad?
power density spikes reaching over 3, 000 milliwatts per square meter, and that's 200 meters away from the focal point.
this is a Class 9 event?
no, it's a 10.
the power spikes are coming from Liberty Island.
the D. O.D. complex.
Charlie and the evacuation teams are en route.
okay, air quality normal. No need for oxygen. Let's go.
this is Agent Lee.
we're still seeing dangerously high levels.
understood, Mr. Secretary.
false alarm! Let's pack it back up!
Yeah, stand down. Let's go, come on.
what's going on?
we've been ordered to stand down.
but what about the energy surges?
they're still happening.
well, did they give you any reasons as to why?
explanations are above my pay grade.
I think I know who to ask.
damn it.
no measurable improvement?
environmental degradation levels haven't changed since the device was activated.
reversing this many years of damage will take longer than a few hours.
Mr. Secretary, Olivia Dunham is here to see you.
send her in.
let me know if anything changes.
I'd hoped you brought Henry.
uh, he's with the nanny. I'm actually on duty at the moment, sir.
so this is a professional visit?
fringe Division identified a Class 10 energy surge emanating from this complex, which would normally justify evacuating a ten-mile radius around the epicenter.
there's no danger for the general public.
we've taken proper precautions.
of course. I wasn't suggesting otherwise.
when I was returning from over there, you had me steal a piece of tech.
tech that you said was part of a weapon that could destroy the other side.
what exactly are you asking, Olivia?
have you activated that weapon?
is that what's causing the surge?
that's classified.
what's going to happen to the people over there?
my concern is for the people of our world.
but your son is over there.
I'm aware.
Peter chose to leave.
he chose his allegiance.
I chose to give up my son so that you could keep yours.
now, if there's nothing further...
so what do we do?
what if we just broke it back down into its component parts?
with the amount of energy this machine is generating,
I don't know what would happen.
the machine is quantum entangled.
it could tear us apart with the energy from the other side alone.
and is that more dangerous than vortexes putting holes in our universe?
Walter, our world is tearing apart at the seams.
still, I'm afraid anything we might do could have devastating consequences.
I just spoke to Nina. I was right.
they picked up an electromagnetic spike at 5: 47 this morning in upstate New York.
fifteen minutes before the vortex opened.
is that how they predict anomalies on the other side?
they also look for odd thermal patterns and radiation spikes.
I've got Nina tracking all three.
an early warning system.
well, at least we'll be able to warn people.
and maybe save some lives.
okay, I'm gonna go to Massive Dynamic and help Nina with the protocol.
I'll call you when I get to New York.
can you let me know if Walter comes up with anything?
there's got to be a way to stop the machine.
perhaps if we encased the entire machine in lead, contained the energy it's emitting.
we both know there's another way.
it makes sense, Walter.
we all thought that I could turn the machine on.
maybe I can turn it off.
maybe that's what the drawing means.
we don't know what the drawing means.
if your theory is accurate, we're running out of time.
and the way that machine responded to me after I touched it, it's like it's been calling out to me.
every piece of data we have about the machine points to one conclusion.
somehow, that machine was made for me.
Peter, you could die.
and if we do nothing, we're all gonna die.
give him the keys and save the girl.
what?
this is what he was doing. He was preparing me.
who? - The observer.
he was preparing me because he knew I would have to let you go.
that I would...
that I would have to sacrifice you to fix the problems I'd created.
I think this is what I'm supposed to do.
but I can't do it without your help.
police and fire departments have been responding to unexplained weather phenomena up and down the eastern seaboard for the last 24 hours.
the National Weather Service has released a storm advisory for the entire east coast.
what do you mean, he's gone? He has to be somewhere.
he didn't just disappear.
there's always a trail. Keep looking.
yes?
agent Dunham has arrived.
Oh, good. Send her in.
Nina. - We're moving forward as you requested.
I've assembled a team.
I've briefed them on the protocol you outlined.
okay, good. So where are we in terms of coverage?
well, I've tasked all of our satellites to focus on the northeast states.
so this is where the thermal detection is up and running?
Yes, but it's far from complete.
it does give us lead time, however, if a vortex starts forming in a densely populated area.
what about the electromagnetic disturbances?
we've re-calibrated our entire cell tower network to warn us if any are detected.
and amber?
all right, there we've hit a wall.
we have enough amber to contain eight, maybe ten events.
but beyond that, our chemists are having a great deal of difficulty finding some of the more rare elements.
without the amber, early detection is irrelevant.
Yes, well...
it wasn't supposed to be this way.
what do you mean, it wasn't supposed to be this way?
I was told on good authority that if you and Peter were together, it would all work out.
what are you talking about? On whose authority?
there's a man that William knew.
I'm not sure where they met.
but he had great confidence in him. He trusted him implicitly.
he advised me to do the same.
after William went missing, when circumstances warranted,
I would consult with him.
this man knows a great deal about the machine.
and you didn't think it was worth mentioning until now?
no, he said if I divulged what he had told me that I would never see or hear from him again.
I didn't want to risk losing that connection.
Nina, our universe is breaking down.
if this man has any information about the machine, then I need to know who he is and what he told you.
you've already met him.
william told me he possessed knowledge beyond anything I could fathom, but even I never suspected anything of this magnitude.
so how'd you find out?
the authors. Anagrams.
I figured it out a few weeks ago.
even the Hebrew and Russian ones are phonetic scramblings of his name.
we've been through these books hundreds of times.
so what else does he know?
I think you and I both know that Sam will reveal only what he wants to.
not this time.
if you track him down.
we don't have an address for him.
he disconnected his phone, shut down the bowling alley.
nobody has seen him since.
if there's even a chance that he can turn this machine off, then I have to speak to him.
I'll find him.
I need the keys, Jeanie.
catch me.
Jeanie. - Nope.
Jeanie. - No.
you're
I didn't mean it. - Yeah?
then what did you mean?
I meant that you mean a lot to me.
you're kind of amazing.
Jack. - What?
what is that?
I have no idea.
remember this?
Yeah.
that was my first commendation.
Yeah, for dragging my ass out of a Class 4 vortex.
well, you actually owed me fifty bucks, so I was going for your wallet.
seems like a million years ago.
you can't do this alone, Liv.
let me come with you.
as much as I would love to have you watching my butt,
I need you here.
now if I'm not back tomorrow, you're gonna take Henry to my mother's, right?
you're coming back. - Yeah, but if I don't,
I need to know that he's safe.
you're the only one that I trust.
you really think Peter Bishop can stop this?
that he can heal both worlds?
I don't know, but if anyone can change the Secretary's mind and get him to turn that machine off, then it's his son, right?
I'll see you when you get back.
agent Dunham, this is a restricted area.
ten months ago, the Secretary brought Peter Bishop back from the other side.
how?
I don't know what you're talking about.
maybe if you just put the gun down.
lie to me again and I'll shoot you in the knee.
I read the mission logs.
I know that the Secretary developed technology to cross between universes and bring back Peter Bishop.
show me where it is.
now.
the watch commander patrols this area every five minutes.
it's every twelve, actually. Nice try.
you realize this is never going to work, right?
I did not ask for your opinion.
the technology you want never made it out of the test phase because it breaks down the molecular cohesion of the person crossing over.
the Secretary took a huge risk using it once.
in some test subjects, even that proved lethal.
I appreciate your concern. Now open the door.
this stuff is not organized.
you've got five seconds. Four...
here it is.
one will get you there and back.
if you make it to the other side, just stay there, because when the Secretary finds out you're a traitor
I'll take my chances.
stop!
there she is!
put your hands up.
let's go!
the other side!
suspect northeast tunnel.
hold your position!
show us your hands, or we will fire on you.
son of a bitch.
what do you want?
Seamus Wiles, now that you mention it, never struck me as an Irish.
Sam Weiss, that makes sense.
well, he went by a few different names, but only one of them rented an apartment in Boston.
you're not gonna tell me what he did?
I just need to ask him a few questions.
so long as there's no dead bodies in there.
what? Did he move out?
if he did, he didn't tell me.
last guy who bailed on the apartment ended up being a hoarder.
took me three weeks to clear out the trash.
here you go, sir.
do you really think this could work?
that Peter can turn off the machine?
the machine's emitting an energy signature almost like an electric current.
Peter thinks that because of his relationship with the machine, that if he goes into it, the current will run through him, creating a kind of a closed circuit.
and if he can complete the circuit, then he can also break it or turn it off.
what do you think?
excuse me?
Peter's your son.
as a father, do you think this is a good idea?
it's because of my selfishness, my inability to let my son go 26 years ago, that this is happening.
my opinion as a father doesn't matter.
Walter, it matters to me.
I honestly don't know what's gonna happen, Phillip.
and the current of energy is so powerful.
it's unlike anything I've ever seen.
and the thought of what that could do to my son...
I don't want him to suffer.
you're all set, Mr. Bishop.
are you sure you don't want me to call Olivia?
if it doesn't work, she's gonna find out soon enough.
just tell her that
whatever it is, you'll tell her yourself.
can I get you anything, son?
a sedative? Something to calm you?
I'm calm.
you're sure now?
I'm okay, Walter.
the techs said they're ready when you are, Peter.
good luck.
if this works and I save both universes,
I want you to consider me officially retired.
I'll think about it.
we'll be here waiting for you.
wait. Give me your hands.
what is that?
Electro-conductive gel.
if there's an energy current, it will pass through the hand holds and this gel will keep it from burning your skin.
I'm okay.
I was never good at letting you go.
this time, you have to.
son...
I know.
male, 32 years of age, closed head trauma, possible concussion, non-responsive.
he suffered a massive surge of electricity.
vitals? - Bp 80 over 50.
pulse 45, regular.
Gail, what's open? - Trauma bay 2.
his blood type is A-positive.
let's take him to 2. We'll do an MRI.
and you need to do an echo-cardiogram as well.
you have to wait here, sir.
no, no, no, no, no. You listen. No, no.
you listen to me.
this is my son.
I understand, sir. We'll take good care of him.
excuse me, Miss.
this area's for staff and immediate family only.
I'm looking for Peter Bishop.
he was brought in about an hour ago.
he's a white, 32
Olivia! She's with us.
how's Peter?
he's still unconscious, but his vitals are stable.
they just-- They can't wake him up.
he's with the doctors now.
Oh, God.
they did an MRI.
they said that there is no apparent brain trauma.
they're just hoping that he's gonna come out of it soon.
what happened?
Peter tried to go into the machine.
it wouldn't let him.
it's like it's protecting itself or something.
is Walter here? - Yeah.
he's taking it pretty hard.
I don't know my way around here.
other people, I suppose, find comfort being in chapels, speaking to you.
I have no other place to turn.
I asked you for a sign, and you sent it to me.
a white tulip.
and I was so grateful.
since then, in moments of deep despair,
I have found solace in believing that you had forgiven me.
I was willing to let him go.
I was willing to let Peter die.
I've changed.
that should matter.
God, I know my crimes are unforgivable.
so punish me.
do what you want to me.
but I beg you, spare our world.
Hello, Olivia.
Sam, I've been looking for you everywhere.
the machine is on.
I know. And I need you to take me to it.
Sam, what is going on?
Olivia, you have to trust me now, please.
we don't have a lot of time.
I know this is hard for you.
Oh, you don't know anything about me.
don't I?
this morning in my office, you asked how I could be willing to let my son die to heal our world.
but you understand sacrifice better than anyone, Olivia.
you were willing to leave your son behind, to risk your life for what you perceived to be the greater good.
we're more alike than you think.
I don't understand how killing billions of people could possibly be in the interest of the greater good.
that's because you still have the luxury of your ideals.
I have to be pragmatic.
you've put me in a difficult position.
anyone else would be rotting away in a stockade for treason, but you are the mother of my grandson.
you'll stay here for your own good until this is over.
you SHOULD PUT KEYS ON YOUR BACK.
excuse ME?
it's AN OLD WIVE'S TALE.
to STOP THE BLOODY NOSE.
yeah?
actually, I TRIED IT ONCE.
it DOESN'T WORK.
it's ALL BULL.
excuse ME.
excuse ME, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
Yes, SIR, I'LL BE WITH YOU IN ONE MOMENT.
no, NOW!
please.
I'll BE RIGHT BACK.
what's E PROBLEM? - I'M IN TROUBLE.
there's SOMETHING HAPPENING TO ME,
that I DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR PERMISSION TO EXPLAIN TO YOU.
what IS IT?
you NEED TO LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY.
I NEED YOU TO GO TO THE PASSENGERS,
I NEED Y TO COLLECT AS MANY SEDATIVES OR TRANQUILIZERS AS YOU CAN.
okay, SIR, I NEED YOU TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
this ISN'T A PANIC ATTACK.
this IS REAL.
we WILL DIE, ALL OF US, IF YOU DON'T DO WHAT I SAY.
sir, A THREAT LI THAT IS IN VIOLATION OF FFA
do I LOOK TO YOU LIKE I CARE ABOUT THAT?
Oh, MY GOD.
I NEED YOU TO GET THOSE DRUGS FOR ME.
do YOU HAVE ANY WEAPONS, A GUN?
go CALL THE CAPTAIN.
sir, I'M GOING TO NEED YOU TO CALM DOWN.
you're GOING TO SCARE THE PASSENGERS.
they SHOULD BE SCARED. WHAT WEAPONS DO YOU HAVE?
Yeah, IT'S MELISSA.
what WEAPONS?!
we HAVE A MAN HERE, WHO'S CLAIMING TO BE IN WE HAVE A TASER IN THE COCKPIT,
which I WILL USE ON YOU IF YOU DON'T CALM DOWN.
taser WON'T DO A THING. IT'LL JUST PISS ME OFF.
he WANTS DRUGS, BUT HE SEEMS TO BE ON SOMETHING ALREADY.
I NEED YOU TO DO WHAT I SAY.
I'm GOING INTO THAT BATHROOM.
you KEEP ME IN THERE. YOU KEEP THAT DOOR CLOSED.
get WHATEVER SEDATIVES YOU CAN AS SOON AS Y CAN.
you CAN GO IN THAT BATHROOM, SIR.
I AM NOT MESSING AROUND!
when YOU GET THE DRUGS, YOU COME BACK, YOU KNOCK.
if I DON'T ANSWER,
or IF I DO, AND WHAT YOU SEE ISN'T ME ANYMORE,
you KEEP THAT DOOR CLOSED.
you HEAR ME?
you KEEP ME IN THERE, AWAY FROM THE OTHER PASSENGERS.
get THE DRUGS. QUICK.
Yes, SIR. I'LL DO THAT.
Yes, SIR, BUT I THINK 40 MINUTES IS TOO LONG.
ladies AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A PASSENGER WHO IS HAVING A HARD TIME...
please REMAIN CALM.
everything's GOING TO BE JUST FINE.
what's HE DOING IN THERE?
I DON'T KNOW.
it JUST GOT QUIET.
maybe HE PASSED OUT.
the CAPTAIN SAYS WE SHOULD RESTRAIN HIM.
I've ONLY
seatbelts. SEATBELTS.
well, HELLO.
look, AUNT LIV, I'M BEAUTIFUL.
you ARE BEAUTIFUL.
Yes, YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
but WHY DON'T WE PUT THIS DOWN AND TAKE THESE OFF?
here, GIVE ME-- WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE HERE?
I'll TAKE THAT.
all RIGHT. GO WASH THAT OFF.
okay? - ???
sorry. - OH, PLEASE. THAT'S FINE.
do YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD THAT SLEEPOVER AT AUNT MISSY'S?
and THEN YOU FOUND THE PERFUME AND POURED IT ALL OVER
was IT LOLA?
no, LOLA WAS THE HAMSTER.
Roxy WAS THE DOG. - RIGHT.
Liv, WHAT IS THIS?
is THIS MOM'S?
always?
this ISN'T MOM'S.
no.
it's FROM JOHN.
your PARTNER, JOHN?
Yeah.
you TOLD ME THAT YOU GUYS WERE
he ASKED YOU TO MARRY HIM?
uh, NO.
he DIDN'T. IT WAS A MISTAKE.
suffice TO SAY THAT IT NEVER ACTUALLY HAPPENED.
uh, NO. YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
well, I HAVE TO.
I AM YOUR SISTER.
and I HAVE TOLD YOU EVERY EXCRUCIATING DETAIL OF MY FAILED MARRIAGE.
there's NOTHING THAT YOU CAN-- - HE WAS A TRAITOR.
the PEOPLE THAT HE WAS WORKING WITH,
they STILL DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THEY WERE.
but WHOEVER THEY WERE, HE WAS BAD.
and WHATEVER WAS BETWEEN WAS A LIE,
so THAT HE COULD GAIN MY TRUST, SO THAT I DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR WHAT HE WAS.
God, LIV...
I'm SO SORRY.
Yeah.
me TOO.
and I THOUGHT GREG WAS A JERK.
uh, GREG IS A JERK.
Yeah. GREG IS A JERK.
Hello?
where?
flight 718 WENT DOWN A LITTLE AFTER 6: 00 PM.
witnesses SAY THE PLANE JUST FELL OUT OF THE SKY.
once WE RECOVER THE BLACK BOX, WE'LL KNOW MORE.
so WHY ARE WE HERE?
shouldn't NTSB BE TAKING POINT?
according TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL,
they GOT A DISTRESS CALL FROM THE PILOT,
but IT WAS CUT OFF AND THEY LOST COMMUNICATION.
whatever HAPPENED UP THERE,
I'm GUESSING HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU.
it's BURNED BADLY.
forensics THOUGHT IT WAS AN ANIMAL AT FIRST.
they WERE MISTAKEN.
no ONE'S EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL LIKE THIS.
I CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONFUSION.
this CREATURE HAS PELAGE CHARACTERISTIC OF AN ANIMAL.
and YET...
I WILL SAY THIS...
our FRIEND HERE DIDN'T START OUT THIS WAY.
Hey, LIV.
Hey.
??? PASSENGER MANIFEST.
?? 147 PASSENGERS.
it's GOING TO BE A LONG FEW DAYS
for THE POOR FOLKS TASKED WITH TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE REMAINS.
so IS THERE ANYONE OF ANY INTEREST?
not AT FIRST GLANCE, NO.
does THE ELDER BISHOP HAVE ANY IDEAS ABOUT THAT?
not YET.
or IF HE DOES, HE ISN'T SAYING.
so THE OFFICIAL WORD RIGHT NOW IS ENGINE FAILURE.
the PILOT TRIED TO BRING IT IN FOR AN EMERGENCY LANDING.
the WAY THIS THING WORKS
works-- WHAT IT DOES TO YOU?
it's A HORROR SHOW.
it's FAR WORSE THAN YOU CAN EVEN IMAGINE.
I'm TELLING YOU, THIS STUFF...
it's A HORROR SHOW, JOHN.
what? YOU FIND SOMETHING?
Yeah, I THINK THIS IS OUR GUY.
the FRIED DOG MAN? - YEAH.
we NEED TO PULL EVERYTHING WE CAN FIND ON HIM.
how CAN YOU KNOW THAT?
call IT MY GUT.
you're GOOD.
I WOULD EXPECT WHATEVER CAUSED THIS MUTATION
would've COMPLETELY ALTER HIS INTERNAL ORGANS.
though THE KIDNEYS APPEAR NORMAL.
it ALSO GAVE HIM FOUR EXTRA NIPPLES.
maybe HE MUTATED INTO A OPOSSUM.
no, OPOSSUM'S HAVE 15 MAMMARIES.
unlike MOST MAMMALS, WHO HAVE AN EVEN NUMBER OF NIPPLES.
hence, THE ONE HALF RULE REGARDING NIPPLES.
the ONE HALF NIPPLE RULE?
you JUST HAD TO ASK, DIDN'T YOU?
the TYPICAL NUMBER OF YOUNG IN A LITTER IS USUALLY EQUAL TO HALF THE NUMBER OF NIPPLES ON THE ANIMAL.
the NUMBER OF NIPPLES BEING THE MAXIMUM LITTER SIZE.
humans, FOR EXAMPLE,
one CHILD IS THE TYPICAL.
maximum, TWINS.
barring EXTRAORDINARY CASES.
in WHICH CASE, NUMEROUS NIPPLES WOULD BE WARRANTED.
God, I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO HEAR HIM SAY THE WORD "NIPPLE" AGAIN.
evidence OF AN EXTRADURAL HEMATOMA.
possibly EPISTAXIS.
meaning, HE HAD A COLOSSAL NOSEBLEED.
I KNOW.
there's SOMETHING HARD INSIDE HERE.
scalpel.
FORCEP.
what IS IT? A TUMOR?
not UNLESS A TUMOR IS MADE OF GLASS.
I NEED SOMEONE OVER AT VERTUSAIR, RIGHT NOW.
Yes, THIS IS ABOUT 718. WHAT DO YOU THINK?
look THROUGH ALL THE INTERNAL REPORTS ON STRUCTURAL BREAKDOWN
here's EVERYTHING WE HAVE ON MARSHALL BOWMAN 42-YEARS-OLD, WORKED AT A CREDIT CORTIER IN MARSEILLES.
managed THEIR CORPORATE ACCOUNTS.
has DOCTOR BISHOP BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A POSITIVE ID YET?
no, BUT WE SHOULD CONTACT THE BANK,
and SEE WHAT THEY CAN TELL US ABOUT HIM.
done.
last PAGE HAS BOWMAN'S CLIENTS FROM THE U. S.
he OUTDID HIMSELF THIS TIME.
and HE'S GONNA GET IMPATIENT TO SELL IT OFF.
so YOU HAVE TO GET THE MONEY LINED UP FAST.
what?
Olivia, YOU OKAY?
people, WE GOT SOMETHING.
Simmons, PATCH ME IN THROUGH PUBLIC ADDRESS.
Wilson SENT OVER THE BLACK BOX RECORDING,
the LAST 60 SECONDS OF THE FLIGHT.
play IT.
new YORK CENTER, THIS IS VERTUSAIR 718 HEAVY.
we HAVE A REPORT THAT THERE TOWER TO VERTUSAIR 718, OTHER AIRCRAFT CALLING,
say AGAIN?
our PURSER'S REPORTING A DISTURBANCE IN THE MAIN CABIN.
there SEEMS
it's TRYING TO GET IN.
new YORK, WE NEED AN EMERGENCY
718--WE HAVE SOMETHING ON BOARD
it's ALREADY KILLED AT LEAST THREE
dear GOD, HOLD THAT BACK!
that's IT--TECH IS TRYING TO RECOVER MORE.
back TO WORK, PEOPLE.
come HERE A SECOND.
see THIS GUY?
Daniel HICKS, HE OWNS AN IMPORT EXPORT COMPANY BASED IN CHELSEA.
he's THE GUY THAT MARSHALL BOWMAN WAS FLYING IN TO MEET.
so WE NEED TO BRING HI IN FOR QUESTIONING.
this YOUR GUT AGAIN?
what's GOING ON, LIV?
okay, THIS IS GOING TO SOUND INSANE.
so LET'S JUST PUT IT IN THE CATEGORY OF "CRAZY THINGS HAPPENING IN WALTER BISHOP'S LAB.
okay.
John SCOTT AND I SHARED CONSCIOUSNESS.
our MINDS WERE CONNECTED THROUGH A PROCEDURE
before HE DIED, AND...
some OF HIS MEMORIES ARE STILL IN MY HEAD.
his MEMORIES?
and SOMETIMES I GET FLASHES.
I SEE WHAT HE SAW IN THE MEMORY.
and IN ONE OF THESE FLASHES,
I SAW HIM WITH MARSHALL BOWMAN
and THIS GUY...HICKS.
I THINK THEY WERE ALL WORKING TOGETHER.
on WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
a WEAPONS SALE OF SOME KIND?
okay.
I'll BRING HIM IN.
that's IT?
despite THE THOUSAND QUESTIONS I HAVE IN MY HEAD RIGHT NOW,
I'm GOING TO BITE MY TONGUE.
thank YOU.
Bishop's HOUSE OF HORRORS.
Hey, HOW WE DOING?
good, WE GOT THE BLOODWORK BACK.
you WERE RIGHT, IT IS MARSHALL BOWMAN.
anything ELSE?
Yeah, WALTER SEEMS TO THINK HE WAS DOSED WITH SOME KIND OF DESIGNER VIRUS.
so, IT WAS INTENTIONAL.
hard TO SAY IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,
this STUFF DOESN'T EXIST IN NATURE.
and WHOEVER DID IT, WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF CUTTING-EDGE GENETICS.
I MEAN, IT COMPLETELY REWROTE BOWMAN'S DNA.
even IF THE PLANE HADN'T OF CRASHED,
he WOULDN'T HAVE SURVIVED THE TRANSFORMATION.
and...
there's SOMETHING ELSE.
and THIS FALLS UNDER THE HEADING OF "WHAT THE HELL?
but WE FOUND SOMETHING IN HIS LEFT HAND.
here, I'LL STREAM IT TO YOU.
it's A GLASS DISK, ABOUT THE SIZE OF A NICKEL.
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
we FOUND A SIMILAR DISK ON THE D. E.A. AGENT A FEW MONTHS BACK.
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME THAT BOWMAN WAS A BANKER.
now YOU'RE TELLING ME HE'S SOME KIND OF AGENT?
uh, I DON'T KNOW.
but CHARLIE IS BRINGING IN A GUY
who MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE US SOME ANSWERS.
why DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS, MR. HICKS.
my BUSINESS...
it's IMPORT AND EXPORT.
but YOU KNOW THAT ALREADY.
you JUST CAME FROM MY OFFICE.
why DON'T YOU INDULGE US, MR. HICKS?
what DO YOU IMPORT AND EXPORT?
furniture, MOSTLY.
mostly FRENCH. 18TH AND 19TH CENTURY.
look, I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.
I RUN A CLEAN BUSINESS.
how DO YOU KNOW MARSHALL BOWMAN?
he's MY BANKER, OVERSEAS.
why, HAS HE GOTTEN INTO SOME KIND OF TROUBLE?
this IS WONDERFUL. DON'T YOU AGREE?
it's JUST LIKE A GOOD DETECTIVE MOVIE.
Mr. HICKS, HAVE YOU HEARD WHAT HAPPENED ON FLIGHT 718?
Yeah, THAT'S THE PLANE THAT CRASHED, RIGHT?
Mm-hmm.
this MIGHT BE HARD TO RECOGNIZE, BUT...
this IS MARSHALL BOWMAN.
he WAS ON BOARD THAT PLANE.
I...I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I BELIEVE YOU DO, MR. HICKS.
I BELIEVE YOU KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED.
I BELIEVE THAT YOU AND MARSHALL BOWMAN CONSPIRED TO DISTRIBUTE A DEADLY VIRUS,
and THIS IS THE UNINTENDED RESULT.
look...
I THINK YOU HAVE ME MISTAKEN FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
your NOSE IS BLEEDING.
can WE HAVE A BOX OF TISSUES, PLEASE?
no.
no, TISSUE WON'T HELP.
find ME SOME SEDATIVES.
now!
I NEED HELP.
Walter, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
I EXPECT THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED TO THAT MAN IN THE AIRPLANE.
I MAY BE ABLE TO SUSPEND THE PROCESS.
No! - NOT YET.
not UNTIL HE TALKS.
please!
you WANT HELP? I WANT ANSWERS.
WE...MUST... HAVE...BEEN...DOSED.
I WANT TO KNOW THE NAME. WHO DOSED YOU?
Oh, I DON'T THINK THAT'S WORKING.
I CHECKED THE DHS DATABASE,
nothing CAME UP A "CONRAD," FIRST OR LAST NAME,
when CROSS-REFERENCED WITH A DANIEL HICKS.
well, SO FAR, THERE'S NO MENTION OF A "CONRAD IN JOHN'S OLD FILES, EITHER.
hm.
why DON'T YOU LET ME TAKE A TURN?
thank YOU.
anything?
Yes.
as OFTEN IS THE CASE, HAS GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS.
he IS TRANSFORMING,
but I PLACED HIM IN A MEDICALLY-INDUCED COMA, TO SLOW THE PROCESS.
which IS THAT? THE GOOD, OR THE BAD?
huh? - WHICH IS IT?
the GOOD NEWS, OR THE BAD NEWS?
that's THE BAD NEWS.
the GOOD NEWS, IS THAT I'VE ALREADY SYNTHESIZED
a PRELIMINARY SAMP OF AN ANTIDOTE.
I'm TESTING IT ON TISSUE SAMPLES AS WE SPEAK.
and...a WATERMELON.
as A CONTROL GROUP.
and WILL IT BE READY IN TIME?
that DEPENDS ON YOUR DEFINITION OF TIME.
if YOU MEAN BEFORE HE TURNS INTO A BEAST,
I WOULDN'T WAGER ON IT, NO.
wonderful.
cut OPEN HIS HAND.
what?
I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S A DISK IN IT.
like BOWMAN'S.
I LIKE CUTTING.
where DID YOU GET THESE?
one OF THEM WAS IN BOWMAN'S PALM.
the OTHER ONE WAS ON HICKS.
we've SEEN ONE OF THESE BEFORE.
did THE N. S.A. EVER DETERMINE WHAT IT WAS FOR?
a DATA STORAGE DEVICE.
apparently USED TO TRANSPORT INFORMATION.
I WANT AUTHORIZATION TO EXHUME JOHN SCOTT'S BODY.
I THINK HE MAY HAVE ONE OF THESE ON HIM, TOO.
I THINK HE WAS WORKING WITH BOWMAN AND HICKS.
I'm AFRAID THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE.
well, THEN MAKE IT POSSIBLE.
excuse ME?
I KNOW IT'S AGAINST PROTOCOL, BUT RIGHT NOW, FRANKLY, - I DON'T GIVE A DAMN. - STOP.
and IF YOU DON'T WANT TO ASK HARRIS, THEN
I SAID STOP. - GO AND ASK HIM, MYSELF.
I CAN'T DELIVER JOHN SCOTT'S BODY.
and THAT OTHER DISK?
it DIDN'T GO TO THE N. S.A.
where DID IT GO?
one OF THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT'S BIGGEST CONTRACTOR
is THE MASSIVE DYNAMIC HAS MONEY TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES
generations BEYOND THAT OF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT.
so WHEN WE WERE UNABLE TO RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION OFF THE DISKS,
I REQUESTED NINA'S HELP
but I SUSPECT THAT YOU TELLING ME THIS ISN'T THE ONLY REASON THAT WE'RE HERE.
agent DUNHAM.
miss SHARP.
for WHAT IT'S WORTH, IT WAS NOT MY DECISION
to KEEP THIS FROM YOU.
as YOU SUSPECTED,
we DISCOVERED A GLASS DISK IDENTICAL TO THE OTHERS,
embedded IN AGENT SCOTT'S HAND.
while HE MAY APPEAR TO BE ALIVE, I ASSURE YOU HE IS NOT.
we've KEPT HIM IN A SUSPENDED STATE OF
we BELIEVE THAT THE INFORMATION STORED IN THE DISKS
self-destructs WHEN THE DISK'S HOST DIES.
we ATTEMPTED TO UTILIZE AGENT SCOTT'S BODY
his BLOOD, HIS DNA-- TO TRY TO RETRIEVE THE DATA.
the SMALL AMOUNT OF INFORMATION WE WERE ABLE TO GATHER
seems TO IMPLICATE AGENT SCOTT
as PART OF A BIO-TERROR CELL.
there WERE ALSO REFERENCES TO A CONRAD.
we BELIEVE HE'S A SCIENTIST.
designing CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS FOR SALE ON THE BLACK MARKET.
CIA HAS RECEIVED SCATTERED INTEL HIM IN THE PAST
nothing CONCRETE.
we DON'T EVEN KNOW HIS FULL NAME.
so A PLANE FULL OF PEOPLE ARE DEAD.
and OUR BEST LEAD IS...NOTHING?
a CHEMIST, WHO'S NAME WE DON'T EVEN KNOW?
it GETS WORSE.
three HOURS AGO, FRENCH INTELLIGENCE RELATED TO D. C.
that AN INFORMANT OF THEIRS CLAIMS A MAJOR WEAPONS SALE
is ABOUT TO GO DOWN IN CHICAGO.
however, WHAT THE INFORMANT WAS UNABLE TO SAY
is EXACTLY WHERE, OR WHEN, THE SALE IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE.
what THE INFORMANT DID KNOW IS THAT THE MAN BEHIND THE SALE
is KNOWN AS CONRAD.
Hello?
I'm ON MY WAY BACK. IS WALTER THERE?
Yeah, WHY?
I JUST GOT WORD THAT CONRAD'S PLANNING ON SELLING THIS VIRUS.
what? WHEN?
I DON'T KNOW.
but IF I'M RIGHT, AND JOHN WAS WORKING WITH THESE GUYS,
then HE HAS THE ANSWER IN HIS MEMORY.
which MEANS THAT IT'S IN MINE.
you KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THIS IS
tell WALTER TO PREP THE TANK.
I'm GOING BACK IN.
we're ONLINE.
all RIGHT.
can YOU HEAR ME?
Yes.
you MUST LISTEN TO MY VOICE AT ALL TIMES.
it IS YOUR CONNECTION, YOUR LIFELINE.
understood? - UNDERSTOOD.
I AM GOING TO TRY AND GUIDE YOU THROUGH JOHN SCOTT'S MEMORY
in AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE HE MET OUR COMATOSE FRIEND, HERE.
now, PICTURE YOURSELF AT THE TOP OF A STEEP FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
as YOU DESCEND, STEP BY STEP,
you'll BECOME PROGRESSIVELY MORE, AND MORE RELAXED.
now, HERE COME THE LAST FIVE STEPS.
four...
three...
two...
one.
where ARE YOU?
I'm IN A BEDROOM.
no, IT'S NOT A BEDROOM.
this IS WHERE WE USED TO MEET.
John AND I.
Oh, MAN. THIS IS CRAZY.
absolutely, THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
no.
ask HER WHAT SHE SEES.
what DO YOU SEE?
me AND JOHN.
don't WORRY, HE CAN'T SEE YOU.
remember, YOU'RE OBSERVING A MEMORY.
I'll BE RIGHT BACK.
Hi, LIV.
Olivia, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
John's TALKING TO ME.
that's NOT POSSIBLE, OLIVIA.
he CAN'T SEE YOU.
we'll TRY TO TAKE YOU ELSEWHERE.
where JOHN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES MET.
don't MOVE. - LIV, WHAT'S WRONG?
stop.
don't. DON'T MOVE.
Olivia, FOCUS ON THE SOUND OF MY VOICE.
I SAID STAY THERE.
I MISS YOU.
don't MOVE.
I'm GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION,
and YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME THE ANSWER.
you WERE WORKING WITH A MAN NAMED CONRAD.
he DEVELOPED A BIOLOGICAL WEAPON.
I WANT TO KNOW WHO HE IS,
and WHO HE'S PLANNING ON SELLING IT TO.
Liv, PUT THE GUN
stop LYING TO ME, JOHN.
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE PART OF A TERRORIST CELL.
we HAVE YOUR PARTNER IN CUSTODY.
he's DYING. AND BOWMAN IS ALREADY DEAD.
they WERE INFECTED WITH SOME KIND OF A VIRUS.
LIV-- - NO!
what JUST HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
we NEED TO GET HER OUT, NOW.
we CAN'T. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
she's IN DEEP REM.
we NEED TO RECONNECT BEFORE WE PULL HER OUT.
Olivia, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
Olivia, CAN YOU HEAR
I WANT ANSWERS, JOHN.
there HE IS.
who?
he's A MONSTER, LIV.
capable OF CREATING HORRIBLE THINGS.
weapons, WHICH HE DOES FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN BECAUSE HE CAN.
cause HE'S CURIOUS.
then HE SELLS THEM TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.
that's HIM.
and THAT'S ME.
problem WAS, WE WERE HUNTING A MAN NONE OF US HAD EVER SEEN BEFORE.
if I'D HAVE KNOWN I HAD HIM IN MY SIGHTS,
I COULD'VE TAKEN HIM OUT RIGHT THEN AND THERE
it WAS MY MOST IMPORTANT MISSION.
and I FAILED.
I LET THAT MONSTER GET AWAY.
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS HIM.
what MISSION?
who WERE YOU WORKING FOR?
see, BOWMAN AND HICKS...
the TRUTH IS, THEY WERE AND THEY ARE...
government AGENTS.
N. S.A. SECRET TASK FORCE.
and SO WAS I.
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
it's THE TRUTH, LIV.
no, NOT AGAIN.
if YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE YOU, THEN YOU NEED TO PROVE IT TO ME.
I CAN'T, LIV.
it WAS BLACK OPS, A DENIABLE OPERATION.
if WE WERE TO TAKE OUT CONRAD,
there COULD BE NO RECORD OF OUR INVOLVEMENT.
that's WHY I COULD NEVER TELL YOU.
even THOUGH I WANTED TO.
if THAT'S THE TRUTH, TH HELP ME.
tell ME WHERE THE SALE IS GOING DOWN.
what SALE?
the VIRUS.
we BELIEVE THAT CONRAD'S PLANNING ON SELLING IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON INSIDE CONRAD'S ORGANIZATION ANYMORE.
but HICKS WOULD KNOW.
you NEED TO TALK TO HICKS.
he WAS PRIVY TO ALL THAT INFORMATION HE HAS IT RIGHT IN HIS HAND.
Liv, TRUST HICKS.
he CAN HELP YOU.
we HAVE TO PULL HER OUT.
John! - PREPARE 30 CC'S OF DEXTROAMPHETAMINE.
Oh, PETER. - YOU'RE OKAY.
you're GOING TO BE FINE.
I UNDERSTAND.
thanks FOR CHECKING.
my CONTACT AT N. S.A. COULDN'T CONFIRM A SINGLE THING THAT JOHN SAID.
of COURSE, JOHN SAID THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO.
well, THAT'S THE PERFECT ALIBI.
one THAT YOU CAN'T CONFIRM.
uh, YEAH.
how's IT COMING?
his CELL SAMPLE'S MEMBRANES STILL AREN'T ABSORBING THE INHIBITOR.
we DON'T KNOW IF THE ANTIDOTE'S WORKING YET.
but IT MIGHT.
we COULD TRY IT AND SEE.
you WANT TO WAKE UP HICKS?
even THOUGH HE COULD TRANSFORM JUST LIKE BOWMAN DID?
well, CONRAD COULD BE SELLING THIS VIRUS AS WE SPEAK.
and HICKS IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN TELL US
how THIS IS GOING TO GO DOWN.
and YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE JOHN'S WORD
that YOU CAN TRUST HICKS?
it FINALLY HAPPENED.
I'm NOW REFERRING TO A DEAD GUY, WHO ONLY EXISTS IN YOUR MIND.
boy!
I NEED ANOTHER BAG OF MIDAZOLAM RIGHT AWAY.
what IF HE'S STILL LYING TO YOU?
have YOU CONSIDERED THAT?
if HICKS AND JOHN ARE WORKING WITH CONRAD,
that MAYBE JOHN IS USING YOU TO TIP CONRAD OFF?
maybe HE WANTS TO GET YOU KILLED.
this IS A BAD IDEA.
my MOTHER ALWAYS SAYS
I STICK MY NOSE IN PLACES IT DOES NOT BELONG.
I KNOW WE HAVEN'T KNOWN EACH OTHER THAT LONG.
but YOU ARE ONE OF THE BEST JUDGES OF CHARACTER I'VE EVER MET.
so, I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S YOUR INSTINCT?
when YOU WERE WITH JOHN,
when YOU WERE LOOKING IN HIS EYES,
was HE FOR REAL?
prep HICKS.
ready OR NOT, WE'RE ADMINISTERING THE ANTIDOTE.
an EXPERIMENT...
how EXHILARATING.
this IS AGENT DUNHAM.
sorry TO WAKE YOU.
little WORSE THAN ADRENALINE.
except, PERHAPS, LICE, WHICH IS A NIGHTMARE.
Mr. HICKS, TRY AND BREATHE NORMALLY.
can YOU HEAR ME?
this IS AN ANTIDOTE.
while I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT IT'LL ACTUALLY WORK,
I DO HAVE A RECORDED I. Q. OF...
Really?
we KNOW ABOUT THE WORK YOU WERE DOING WITH JOHN SCOTT.
now WE NEED YOUR HELP.
for THOSE OF YOU NOT IN THE KNOW,
information HAS COME TO THIS AGENCY ABOUT A WEAPONS BUY.
the GOODS?
the SAME VIRUS RESPONSIBLE FOR FLIGHT 718.
I KNOW THIS LABEL GETS SLAPPED ON PRETTY MUCH ALL WE DO,
but PREVENTING THIS TRANSACTION FROM TAKING PLACE
is OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY.
the PROSPECTIVE BUYER OF THIS WEAPON LANDED IN THE UNITED STATES THIS MORNING.
and WE WERE THERE.
that SUSPECT IS NOW IN CUSTODY.
and NO SURPRISE TO ANYONE, REFUSES TO COOPERATE.
but WE DO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE IN CUSTODY.
an INFORMANT WITH EXTENSIVE INFORMATION ON THE PLAYERS WE WILL BE DEALING WITH
his NAME IS DANIEL HICKS.
and HE HAS AGREED TO RELAY ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION TO AGENT DUNHAM
using AN ENCRYPTED AND UNTRACEABLE TWO-WAY RADIO,
which WE IMPLANTED EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.
agent FRANCIS WILL COORDINATE SURVEILLANCE.
the INFORMANT DISCLOSED THAT THE MEET
is SCHEDULED FOR 1600 HOURS, AT THE FAIRCHILD HOTEL.
room 1021.
the SELLER, A MAN KNOWN AS CONRAD WILL NOT BE THERE.
but HIS INTERMEDIARIES WILL.
we HAVE AGENTS STANDING BY TO MOVE IN IN CORRESPONDING ROOMS.
per REGULATIONS, NO RAID WILL BE ORDERED
until AGENT DUNHAM HAS VISUAL ON THE WEAPON.
when SHE DOES, SHE'LL GIVE THE GO SIGNAL.
that SIGNAL WILL BE...
Christmas.
now WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW SHE WORKS THAT INTO CONVERSATION.
okay, PEOPLE, LET'S GET IT DONE.
listen UP.
spotted THE SELLER.
the SELLER IS MAKING A PHONCALL.
stand BY.
you DIDN'T HAVE TO COME WITH ME, YOU KNOW.
shady DEALS WITH SHADY GUYS IN SHADY HOTELS IS MY M. O.
and TYPICALLY,
if SOMEONE IS GOING TO KILL YOU,
it's A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE AN ALLY IN THE ROOM.
I'm NOT SCARED.
being FEARLESS DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE BEING SAFE.
Astrid, HOW'RE WE DOING?
Hicks IS ON BOARD AND READY TO GO.
I'm PUTTING YOU ON SPEAKER.
so FAR SO GOOD, OLIVIA.
not BAD CONSIDERING 3 CC'S OF ADRENALINE.
are THEY GOING TO EXPECT BONA FIDES?
Hicks, TELL ME WHAT I NEED TO KNOW.
well, THEY'RE GOING TO BE SUSPICIOUS
why THEY'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE.
you TELL THEM YOU USED TO WORK WITH ANDERSON.
Anderson, OKAY. GOT IT, WHAT ELSE?
you TELL THEM ERNESTO FLEW IN FOR THE MEETING,
but HE GOT CALLED BACK TO THE BASEMENT,
and HE COULDN'T COME.
what DO YOU MEAN, "CALLED BACK TO THE BASEMENT?
just SAY IT, HE'LL UNDERSTAND.
you're NOT MESSING WITH ME, ARE U, HICKS?
you TRUSTED JOHN SCOTT, RIGHT?
then TRUST ME.
he's ON THE MOVE.
seller's HEADING INSIDE.
that's HIM.
here WE GO.
you BE CAREFUL.
you're GAVIN. SUSAN.
I USED TO WORK WITH ANDERSON.
I WAS EXPECTING SOMEONE ELSE.
well, ERNESTO FLEW IN,
but HE WAS CALLED BACK TO THE BASEMENT,
so HE COULDN'T MAKE IT.
who's HE?
who ARE THEY?
we'll SWEEP YOU AND GET TO BUSINESS.
good.
she's CLEAN.
the MONEY PLEASE.
just A FORMALITY, I ASSURE YOU.
it WILL ONLY TAKE A MOMENT.
have WE MET BEFORE? YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.
did YOU WORK WITH ANDERSON, TOO?
he's TESTING YOU.
you TELL HIM PETER MET ANDERSON AT NEW COLLEGE AT OXFORD.
they MET AT OXFORD. NEW COLLEGE.
isn't THAT RIGHT?
what DOES IT MATTER TO YOU WHERE I MET ANYONE?
where DID YOU MEET? ON CAMPUS?
I'm SORRY, I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY ACTUALLY MET.
we MET AT THE WHITE HORSE.
on WHEATLY ROAD, YOU KNOW IT?
I DON'T RECALL.
you WOULD. THAI FOOD--IT'S FANTASTIC.
that's WHERE I MET ANDERSON.
I COULD TELL YOU WHAT EACH OF US WAS WEARING,
if YOU WANT TO HEAR IT.
where THE HELL DID HE COME UP WITH THAT?
I HAVE NO IDEA.
it's ALL HERE.
have A SEAT.
I HAVE TO ADMIT...
I WAS SKEPTICAL THAT YOU'D COME AT ALL.
well, OF COURSE WE CAME.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PARIS ALL OVER AGAIN.
tell HIM THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE FRENCH INTELLIGENCE REPORT,
and HE KNOWS IT.
that WAS BECAUSE OF THE FRENCH INTELLIGENCE REPORT.
you KNOW THAT.
true.
but THIS IS A LARGER PURCHASE.
Hello?
okay.
Conrad WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU.
when?
now.
he's ON HIS WAY.
what's GOING ON?
do THEY HAVE THE PACKAGE?
why ISN'T SHE CALLING THE RAID?
because CONRAD'S COMING.
so WHAT?
so SHE DOESN'T WANT TO SCARE HIM OFF.
she WANTS TO GET HIM.
she's WAITING FOR CONRAD.
we've INCLUDED THIS WITH THE PURCHASE.
it's A REVERSE MUTATOR. AN ANTIDOTE.
it WOULD TAKE YOU YEARS TO REVERSE ENGINEER AN ANTIVIRUS.
it's WHY THE PURCHASE PRICE IS SO HIGH.
the FORMULA IN ITSELF IS DECEIVING IN IT'S COMPLEXITY
well, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A NEED FOR THAT.
it's ONLY IN CASE OF ACCIDENTAL EXPOSURE.
which, I ASSURE YOU, WOULD BE FATAL.
now WHY WOULDN'T ERNESTO CALL ME BACK HIMSELF?
and TELL ME SOMEONE ELSE WAS COMING TO MEET?
Oh, GOD.
get ME A TRANQUILIZER QUICKLY.
it's HAPPENING TO HIM.
Hicks IS TRANSFORMING.
how WOULD I KNOW?
I'm NOT ERNESTO'S MOTHER.
at LEAST TELL ME WHO HE WAS MEETING.
what THE HELL IS GOING ON?
I ASKED YOU...
a SIMPLE QUESTION.
who WAS ERNESTO MEETING?
I NEED A NAME.
somebody, ANYBODY ELSE IN YOUR OPERATION.
Oh, NO.
I'll ASK YOU AGAIN...
who WAS YOUR COLLEAGUE MEETING?
sir, SHOULD WE MOVE IN?
okay, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. OKAY, OKAY.
that's ENOUGH. NOW, JUST TELL THEM!
tell THEM, I'M NOT GETTING GREASED OVER ERNESTO'S DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.
what SECRET IS THAT?
shut YOUR MOUTH! - ERNESTO IS SICK.
he's--he's DYING-- SICK, OKAY?
he JUST DOESN'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW.
damn IT, LIV. GIVE THE SIGNAL.
what THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU, HE ASKED YOU
what THE HELL IS WRONG WITH ME? I GOT A GUN IN MY FACE, FOR STARTERS.
enough OF YOU. - SHUT UP!
get THAT GUN OUT OF MY FACE RIGHT NOW.
who ARE THESE PEOPLE?
according TO THEM, ERNESTO'S SICK.
it's TRUE.
he FOUND OUT THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
I SPOKE TO ERNESTO THIS MORNING.
he's FINE.
kill THEM BOTH RIGHT NOW.
put THE GUN DOWN!
hands ON THE TABLE. GET DOWN.
John SCOTT SAYS HI.
turns OUT, CONRAD'S A FRENCH CITIZEN.
Conrad ETIENNE MOREAU...
wanted IN CONNECTION WITH AT LEAST HALF A DOZEN BIOLOGICAL ATTACKS.
and THOSE ARE JUST THE ONES WE KNOW ABOUT.
he's BEEN MANUFACTURING BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
and DISTRIBUTING THEM ON THE BLACK MARKET FOR YEARS.
and YOU CAUGHT HIM.
I WOULD THINK YOU COULD AT LEAST LET YOURSELF CRACK A SMILE ABOUT THAT.
well, I DIDN'T DO IT ALONE.
you KNOW...
despite THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF THIS CASE,
John SCOTT'S STATUS REMAINS THE SAME.
as FAR AS THIS DEPARTMENT IS CONCERNED,
he's A TRAITOR.
even IF HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.
there's NO WAY TO CONFIRM IT.
that's ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW THE TRUTH.
and THAT'S ENOUGH.
Hello?
anyone HERE?
agent DUNHAM?
where IS EVERYONE?
they TOOK THAT GENTLEMAN THAT WAS HERE
to THE HOSPITAL, TO RECOVER.
so THE ANTIDOTE WORKED?
he STARTED IMPROVING ALMOST AS SOON AS I ADMINISTERED IT.
which IS MORE THAN I CAN SAY FOR MY OWN CONCOCTION.
any CASE, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO READ A BEDTIME STO
I WAS HOPING YOU'D DO ME A FAVOR.
even IF YOU DID GO BACK IN,
I'm DUBIOUS YOU'D EVEN BE ABLE TO FIND HIM.
what DO YOU MEAN?
your BRAIN WAVE PATTERNS ARE RETURNING TO NORMAL.
your MIND IS FINALLY SUCCEEDING IN PURGING ITSELF OF AGENT SCOTT.
even IF YOU PERFECTLY RECONNECT,
it WOULD BE FOR SECONDS, MINUTES AT BEST.
and THEN YOU WOULD NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.
then WE NEED TO DO THIS NOW.
it's BEAUTIFUL OUT HERE, ISN'T IT?
we CAUGHT HIM TODAY.
Really?
I'm SORRY THAT I DOUBTED YOU.
I SHOULD'VE TRUSTED YOU.
no, IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
I ALWAYS MEANT TO TELL YOU.
I GUESS I RAN OUT OF TIME.
there WAS ONE OTHER THING.
I KNOW WE CAN'T EVER BE TOGETHER,
not REALLY.
maybe I WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.
I LOVE YOU, LIV.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
in the bear came across a fox.
and the fox said,"bear, bear, stop right there.
there's a monster up ahead.'
okay, bedtime.
no, no, this is the last book.
Oh, I thought that the last book was the last book.
we are almost done.
you guys work well together, and I don't like it.
hello.
Hey, it's Peter.
what's wrong?
what's wrong? - Is there something wrong?
no. Why, what's wrong with you?
uh, nothing. I assumed there was an emergency.
Nope. No emergency.
what's up?
nothing, I was actually calling for Rachel. Is she there?
Yeah.
actually, it's kinda stupid. I can call back later if you guys are in the middle of something.
no, no, she's right here.
uh, Rach, it's for you. It's peter.
Yeah, did you remember it or not?
are you serious? What is it?
aunt Liv, can we keep on going?
Yeah.
all right, hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on.
Uh,"but I don't see any monster," the bear said.
and he kept walking.
because he didn't believe there was a monster up ahead.
aunt Liv? - Yeah?
monsters aren't real, right?
no, sweetheart. They're not.
the cameras are out.
let's go. We gotta move.
I told you, relax. The alarm's disabled.
there might be a backup system.
no, there isn'T. I checked all the security.
why don't you finish up in here? I want to see what's behind this door.
come on, Jonathan we've gotta get outta here.
hold on a second.
stop right there!
you should be arrested for what you do.
we let them all go. All of them.
these animals deserve better.
how would you like to be caged up and tested on?
shame on you for what you do.
these are living creatures and you murder them.
you're a killer.
tell me you didn't open that door in there.
Yeah, you bet I did.
get out now. All of you get out!
you should be arrested.
experimenting on animals is a crime.
shut her up!
let's go! Let's go! Let's go. Come on!
Jonathan! - Let's go.
what the hell was that?
that thing-- that thing grabbed that guy.
what do we do? Do we call the police?
we can't leave Jonathan. We have to go back.
no, no, no.
this is crazy, this is crazy, this is crazy.
what is that? - I don't know! I can't see!
what did that?
one cream, one sugar.
thank you, Peter.
Peter, no!
Walter, we talked about sharing.
that's not to eat. You've ruined it.
it's an omelet. - It's not an omelet!
Walter, why is there an ear in the omelet?
it was an experiment.
it was a protein-rich incubator.
it was growing. - It was growing?
that's perfect. - No, it's not perfect. You just ruined it.
and you coulda died, had you eaten it.
Hello? - Really?
you know, maybe in the future you could do me a favor and st put a sign warning me not to confuse your toxic playthings with breakfast.
maybe you should get your own breakfast and not poach mine.
dad, that is hardly the point.
remember yesterday when I nearly washed my face in a sink full of acid?
or three days ago you hooked gene up to the solar panels and I nearly electrocuted myself.
this is a lab. You're the one who should be careful.
I trust you look both ways when you cross the street.
yeah but the difference being that if I don't, I'm the only one who gets flattened.
you, Walter, you live in a society with other people.
what?
that was Olivia.
local P. D.Found the vehicle a couple hours ago.
three bodies inside-- two male, one female.
and the cause of death?
they appear to have been attacked by an animal, but the coroner's never seen anything like it.
whatever did this doesn't appear to be indigenous to the area.
well, wherever it is ingenous to, I don't wanna live there.
Oh, interesting.
some would say disgusting.
whatever did this had enormous claws, like those of a bear or of one of the big cats.
the spread of the digits, v-shaped.
it's too wide for one of those creatures.
configuration closer to that of an eagle.
of course much, much larger.
Hey, we're looking for big bird.
don't be ridiculous. Perhaps a pterodactyl.
have evidence techs bag their I. D.S?
no, I don't think they were carrying any.
maybe this is why.
that's a Brockhage lock pick gun, they work great.
a little bulky for my taste, but
looks like these kids were out for more than a joyride.
Mmm, this is-- this is quite delicious.
where did you get that?
in the car, uneaten.
what is the matter with you?
Oh, forgive my son. He's been in a mood all day.
I just figured "don't eat the evidence" went without saying.
I assure you it has no bearing on the case.
four drinks.
three bodies.
there were four people in this group.
we're missing a body.
have we searched the woods?
we had canine units canvass the area.
we didn't turn up any other bodies.
well, maybe one of them got away and survived.
if they did, they could answer a lot of questions.
I'm gonna check local hospitals, see if the emergency room has anything that lines up with an animal attack.
all this stuff is from Junkie Genie'S.
it's a fast food joint up by M.T.
food is crap. But it's cheap, and it's open late.
so it's always filled with undergrads.
I thought you falsified your degree from M.I.T.
Yeah, Peter, why commit to anything when you can just fake it?
I spent some nights there.
maybe we should go through the student database and see if we can I. D.Any of the victims.
I understand Chris Hawkins lives here.
Olivia dunham, FBI.
Yeah, um, Chris isn't here.
I know, but would you mind if I ask you a few questions?
I'm Carl. And no, I would love it.
come on in.
thank you.
Oh, yeah, that isn't mine.
that was left here by a stranger.
can I get you something? Orange juice? Candy?
how 'bout some pants?
Yeah, I can do that.
so how well do you know Chris?
Oh, you know, okay.
Kinda,"hey, how's it going?" "Nice, whatever." "What's for dinner?" That kinda stuff.
why, is he in some kind of trouble?
I'm not at liberty to say.
Oh, no, no, no. Just 'cause he doesn't seem like the type, you know, to get into fbi kinda trouble.
why do you say that?
he's always making flyers, going to rallies.
you know, political. - So what kinda causes?
it's really just the one.
uh, animals forever, I think it's called.
or, no, no, no. Animals first.
he was an animal rights activist?
Yeah, definitely.
he'd save anything with a beak or a claw.
jeez.
whatever got to him had some pretty nasty claws.
and some very large fangs.
what is that?
punctures from the fangs of most likely some type of viper.
so this thing had the claws of a lion and the fangs of a snake?
it reminds me of a woman I once knew in Cleveland.
Walter, these punctures are over four inches apart.
and that would make this snake eight-feet long.
her name was Harriet something.
how is everything?
well, apparently you're looking for a lion-snake named harriet.
did you find anything at M.I.T?
Yeah, the victims were all animal rights activists, a group called "animals first.
so you think that they were breaking into labs that were doing animal testing?
and releasing the animals, which would explain the burglary tools and the lack of I. D.
it would, but it wouldn't explain how whatever it is that these guys released was able to rip a door off their car and kill 'em all.
Walter, have you got any idea what kind of animal would be in a lab that could do this?
well, judging by the wounds, I'd say two or three different ones actually.
righta motley crew of lab animals got together and decided to exact their revenge on mankind.
Astrid, let's look up labs in the area that do research with animals and
see if any of them reported break-ins. Yep, I'm on it.
thank you.
Oh, no.
this is unit 81 responding to the...
monster sighting on route 30.
Roger that, 81.
it's always a monster.
monster must be housewife for raccoon.
you hear that?
any leads on the fourth victim?
no.
what?
nothing.
you called Rachel last night. Anything important?
hardly. U know that song "if you like Pina Coladas"?
we were trying to remember the name. It turns out it's called escape.
so you two are friends now?
does that bother you?
no.
Hey, charlie, what's up?
Oh, good heavens.
Astrid, Charlie just called.
animal control got a call from a woman in newton who claims that she nearly hit a monster on route 30.
so I'm gonna go meet him there.
will you call me if you find anything?
Yeah, sure thing. - Thanks.
be careful.
thank you, Walter.
what was that all about?
nothing.
just want her to be safe.
Hello?
this is Francis.
I need medevac teams and backup sent to my location.
how bad is it?
I don't know. Uh, I'm all right.
what was it? - Big.
what the heck is that?
put the stinger in here, please. Now, please, in here.
excellent. Thank you.
agent, I'd like you to get that eyed down at the hospital.
no, thanks. It won't be necessary.
agent Francis, I'm told you were attacked by the beast.
what did it el like?
it hurt. - No, I mean the animal's dermis.
was it rough like a rhinoceros?
I haven't felt any rhinos lately.
but, uh, it was course like sandpaper.
and the masoma, the tail, was it segmented like a scorpion?
I didn't get a good look at it.
it kept on knocking me on my ass.
perhaps you did, you just can't remember.
trauma can do that. I could hypnotize you
Walter, I think that that's enough for the moment.
but it would be very helpful to identify the traits.
are you okay? Did you take something?
Psychedelics? No, not since thursday, no.
Walter, why don't you share what you're thinking?
I believe we may be dealing with a transgenic species.
which is what? - It's an animal creation.
um, an organism made up of the genes of multiple species.
the best of the best, as it were.
you're saying that you think the creature is man-made?
accelerated Darwinism.
is that even possible?
in theory, yes. Although one would have to solve many problems
incompatible species, massive mutual rejection, similar to when a transplant recipient rejects a donor organ.
and there's a reason for that.
mixing a bunch of species to create a franken-rhino is unnatural and a really bad idea.
Hey, it's me. Is Charlie all right?
Yeah, he's okay.
thank god.
okay, um, you wanted me to look into any labs that might house animals near the first crime scene.
And?
how can I help you, agent Dunham?
Dr. Swift?
you could start by telling me what sort of work you do here at Swift research.
well, we're commissioned by pharmaceutal and cosmetic companies to test their products, to make sure ty're safe before using them in human trials.
Oh, by testing them on animals first?
well, it's an unfortunate but necessary step we feel it's better to have an animal experience an allergic reaction to a certain perfume so that you don't have to.
uh, Dr. Swift, are you aware that a group of college students were attacked and killed near this facility last night?
attacked? By whom?
that's what we're trying to determine.
we believe these students may have been
are you okay?
um, no, actually. We're three days behind on a deadline.
you'll excuse me if I seem insensitive, but what does this have to do with me and this lab?
we believe they were animal rights activists.
that they were killed after they broke in and released animals from a facility much like you have here.
so you're suggesting that a lab animal is responsible?
well, mbe one that was genetically altered?
do you do any of that sort of work here?
no, agent Dunham. I told you we only test products.
and what's more, there was no break-in.
doing some cleanup work?
hundreds of animals in and out of here every week.
as I'm sure you can probably imagine, the cleanup never ends.
mind if I take a look?
uh, not to be a rude host, but you actually do need a warrant.
understand, we deal with billion-dollar trade secrets, and I am obligated to respect my clients' confidentiality.
no, hmm?
how would we accomplish that?
wait, damn it! How can I concentrate with you running around?
Walter, are you talking to me?
no, just thinking out loud.
Walter, I need you to tell me what equipment you would need to genetically alter animals, like, specific items, so that I can see if robert swift's bought any of it.
I would need some sodium bicarbonate and a house in the country, a place to be alone with my thoughts.
some Mahler for the late nights.
and time. A lot of time.
I know, it's like he's on another planet.
you've seen him. He's been like that all day.
but can you focus him?
focusing Walter is even at the best of times just a matter of degrees.
okay, fine. - Thank you.
Hey, walter, I need you to snap back to the planet earth for a second and focus on something that isn't about you.
I'm afraid this is about me, about my work.
I found this book among my old files.
what is this, walter?
Olivia, Is this the creature?
no.
but I fear it's quite similar.
where did you get this?
I tried to make it 20 years ago.
are you saying you created th?
not this one specifically.
my experiments were a failure.
you knew. You knew all along.
you knew that this was connected to your work, and you knew you had information that could help us but you keptt to yourself.
my creatures didn't survive.
someone else must have finished my work.
who, Walter? Who could have done this?
twenty years ago, who were you wking with?
Kelvin Genetics.
we were doing classified work for the U. S.Army.
I need a name, walter. - Uh, guys.
do you remember anybody specific? - No.
guys. This body is moving. - What?
they're still alive. Quick, unzip it. They may be suffocating.
Ugh, maggots! - No, not maggots.
larvae from the creature.
you mean that these are baby monsters?
Yes. We must collect them. Peter, a petri dish.
make it a bucket. - I'm gonna be sick.
two buckets.
Walter, how is this even possible?
the stinger.
it must carry the eggs.
it transfers them to a suitable incubator.
what, you mean it plants the eggs when it stings you?
Yeah. It's fascinating.
Oh, god. Charlie.
so far there have been three reported sightings in the greater boston area
two in Medford and one in Arlington.
authorities advise if you see it or any other wild animal, do not try to confront it yourself.
do you hear this?
there's some kind of mountain lion on the loose.
mountain lion?
Yeah, in boston.
where does a mountain lion come from in boston.
maybe it escaped from the zoo.
well, I doubt that, otherwise they would just say so.
well, baby, that's y you married me. - Why?
cause I can protect you from all the scary things that are out there.
and, uh, who's gonna protect you?
I told you, it's just a scrape.
bad guy, broken bottle.
nothing I haven't handled before a dozen times.
who's that?
Liv. - Charlie, hey.
hat's up? You okay?
Yeah, Charlie, um-- but you may not be.
Electro-conductive gel for the ultrasound.
enough with the suspense.
what is it exactly that we're looking for?
it is possible the stinger we found in you implanted the creature's embryos.
I think this is why the creature didn't eat you.
I think you mabe carrying its offspring.
you trying to tell me that I'm pregnant?
we're hoping not.
so? - Ten
is that
I'm afraid so.
one small piece of good fortune is the creature doesn't mate in the traditional way.
thanks for that, Walter. That's great bedside manner.
so what do we do now?
I don't know. I can't simply remove them.
they've already spread throughout his system.
just give me a second. Astrid.
Walter. Walter, calm down.
Liv, uh, the other victim.
how were these things actually born?
it doesn't matter because, um, it's not gonna go that far.
Walter, there's gotta be something that you can do, all right?
Hey, look at me. You can't check out right now.
we cannot let this man die.
don't you think I know that, peter?
I'm thinking, damn it.
agent Farnsworth, draw 25 milliliters of blood.
Peter, get some trichlorimide.
what aryou gonna do?
poison them.
this is gonna pinch just a little bit.
careful, Peter, it's highly toxic.
if this doesn't work, how much time do I have?
the last victim, we figured 24 hours - after he was-- - Knocked up.
Yeah.
so I have about 16 hours.
careful.
okay, get your toy out.
Hello? Hey, Catherine. Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey. Be careful.
Hey, Catherine, sorry.
Oh, the house?
I made a few calls for you.
this is what I was able to get the army to declassify on Kelvin genetics.
five lab assistants worked there with Dr. Bishop and William Bell.
all of them now in the private sector, none workingn biogenetics as far as I can tell.
and Robert Swift?
no connection.
I've been through the missing persons records a zen times.
there's nothing from any of the local hospitals either.
you're still thinking there was a fourth activist.
and if they're out there and impregnated, then who knows how many more of these things we're looking at.
though presumably we'd have heard something by now.
any more sightings?
not any within the last ten hours.
maybe it's gone. Maybe it went into the river or died from lack of proper food.
agent dunham, Peter Bishop's on line six.
it's bad news.
the poison killed the larvae, but it's poisoned Charlie's blood too.
have you spoken to Charlie?
Yeah, he's putting on a brave face but he's not doing so well.
his blood pressure's down. His kidneys are failing.
I don't understand.
Walter thinks the larvae act like a parasite, feeding off its host for nutrients.
they're killing him so that they can gestate.
did you tell her, Peter, about the blood?
what blood? - Walter has a theory.
he thinks we may be able to trick the larvae into self-destructing.
how do we do that?
transfuse Charlie with the creature's blood, mix their mother's blood with his own.
if they think Charlie's one of them, they'll cease to feed and die from starvation.
it sounds nuts, I know.
but Walter's convinced it'll work. - Okay.
then that's what we'll do. Bye.
what?
we need to find the creature.
it's got three bedrooms, so if we want to have another baby we'll be fine.
Oh, and, uh, the best part about it is it's got this amazing yard.
it's even got a tree house for Tuck.
uh, Catherine, let me call you back.
tuck, come out of there.
Medford, Waltham, Newton, and an unconfirmed report of a giant snake out of watertown.
what are you thinking?
that it doesn't make sense.
I mean, something this big, why aren't there more sightings?
this is just a mild sedative.
it might make you feel more relaxed. - Thanks.
you're welcome. I'm sorry this has happened to you.
it's not your fault.
they didn't tell you. - Tell me what?
the creature, where it came from.
Astrid, I need a schematic of the sewers, section e-3 and f-5.
you've had a thought?
Yeah, I thinkt's traveling derground.
here you go.
thank you.
look at that. All the sightings are near major storm drains.
and each one of them large enough to accommodate to eature.
that makes sense.
if it's part tiger, then it would prefer dark.
and a python would seek out water.
so it's probably only surfacing to eat or to mate.
what?
if it's traveling in the sewer, then we have nothing.
it could be anywhere.
Walter, it's okay. We're making progress.
no, it's not okay.
you tell agent Francis it's okay.
I'll go talk to him.
hang on, hang on, hang on. Holdim down, hold him down.
Charlie. - Lift his shirt.
they're getting bigger.
when?
did they interview any of the witnesses?
Yeah, forward me the statements the second you get them. Thanks.
another sighting?
Yeah, two hours ago at a public park off Hawthorne, which puts it nowhere near the other places it was spotted.
there's no predictable pattern.
this thing could appear anywhere, anytime.
and we'll have no idea.
hello. - Agent Dunham.
Hey, this is Carl Bussler from M. I.T.
what can I do for you, Carl?
uh, you said to call if anything came up, and I think maybe something did.
what is it?
uh, this kid Jonathan hasn't been in class for the last few days.
and I don't know if he was friends with Chris or whatever, but he was into all that animal rights stuff too.
anyway, no one's seen him.
okay, I'll look into it. What's his last name?
miss. You can't go back there.
agent Dunham. - You lied to me.
I did?
you obstructed the course of a federal investigation into the deaths of five people.
will you excuse us for a minute?
Dr. Swift, you failed to tell me that your son Jonathan was at M. I.T.
I'm not sure how that's relevant.
three of his classmates were torn limb from limb the other night, and he hasn't been seen since.
I would say that that would be very relevant.
I don't know how that happened, but my son was not involved.
when was the last time you spoke to Jonathan?
a few days. He's very busy at school.
Yes, I know. Politically active. Animals first.
he wasn't too fond of the work you did here, was he?
I really can't say.
is this going somewhere, agent Dunham?
Yes, a motive.
I believe that he found out about your studies, that your lab was testing on animals, and he and his friends broke in here two nights ago.
but what he didn't know was that you do much more than just test on animals.
you create them, dangerous genetic hybrids.
we're done here.
any further questions, you're gonna have to go through my attorney.
Dr. Swift, this thing has already killed five people and infected one of our agents.
as we speak, his offspring is growing inside of him, killing him.
do you really want his death on your conscience?
now your son is out there, maybe injured, maybe infected, and I can help.
but you need to help me too.
it didn't kill five people.
excuse me?
it was seven.
hello.
Hey, Swift broke.
he admitted that the hybrid came from his laboratory.
apparent he was coaborating with a geneticist called Cameron Deglmann.
well, where is this guy?
uh, dead.
he was at the lab along with Swift's son when the students released the creature.
so what is the link to Kelvin Genetics?
well, that's the interesting part. You get a pen?
good news. That was Olivia. Swift confessed.
apparently this monster has nothing to do with your work, Walter.
no?
swift was working with a geneticist.
for years he was pursuing this work, a Cameron Deglmann.
Deglmann, of course.
whoa, whoa, who's deglmann?
a pioneer in hybridization. Quite brilliant.
in fact it was his work that inspired my research in the first place.
and it never even crossed your mind that he might be involved?
he had a very forgettable face.
and in the more good news column, Olivia was able to get the combination of animals that went into the hybrid.
Oh, oh, go on.
uh, heloderma suspectum.
Yes, a venomous lizard native to north america. Also called the gila monster.
parasitic wasp. Interesting.
desmodus rotundus and
wait, did you say desmodus rotundus?
Yeah. Why, what is that?
it's a type of bat.
of course. Why didn't I think of it before?
their immune system.
makes it a perfect candidate for genetic hybridization.
I'm lost.
bats have an immune system that's unique in the animal kingdom.
they can carry on hundreds of different diseases without ever being affected.
that same system makes it possible for the creature to mature without rejecting its various parts.
the bat was the missing ingredient that allowed the creature to survive.
so now that you know what it is, can you help Charlie?
no. We'll still need a specimen of the creature's blood.
okay.
okay, well, we know what it's made of.
we know at imoves through the sewer.
so can't we, I don't know,like, bait it or something?
just so I'm clear, are you actually suggesting that we go down into the sewers and wait for this thing to eat us?
well, no. - Yes!
Yes. - Oh, no.
no?
it's not interested in food. - No.
but we do have something that it is interested in.
bats are a highly maternal species.
they are quite protective of their young.
Walter, are you saying that we can lure this thing by dangling those larvae in front of it?
Yes. But no.
Oh, great, this again.
it won't be necessary to be in front of it.
bats are capable of seeking out their offspring from miles away.
we've already determined that it's traveling through the sewer systems.
so we just need to lure it from a central location.
wonderful, so we're gonna antagonize this thing into chasing us and then what, walter?
well, now that I have a better idea of its biological makeup,
I think I can kill it, assuming that can provide us with 50-caliber incendiary rounds, agent Dunham.
well, that's not exactly fbi standard-issue, Walter.
are you sure about this?
if my theory is correct and the bat traits are dominant in the creature, then yes, I believe we can successfully lure it.
whether we can survive the encounter is the more intriguing question.
okay, we missing anything?
could you carry these, son?
sure thing.
be careful. You must be very gentle with them.
right,'cause we wouldn't want to hurt the monster babies.
you need anything?
a shot of J. D. And a chaser of beer would be nice.
you know, hunting this thing in the sewers...
it's not a good idea, Liv.
you got a better idea?
Yeah. Don't get hurt for me.
well, that's not really very fair considering you would do the same thing for me.
I'll be back soon, promise.
you will cl me if his condition changes.
I will.
we ready?
ready as I'll ever be.
Walter, let's go.
be right there, son.
based on the schematics, this will make a fine infiltration point.
nothing to see here, ma'am.
just routine maintenance.
smells great down here.
so what's next, Walter?
there's an intersection 100 feet down here that will conduct the sound most effectively.
nearly there.
the larvae are creating a vibration, frequencies of sound detectable by bats and hopefully our guest of honor.
well, now I know what it feels like to be live bait.
Hey, come on, let's get into position.
hello.
you just get in?
I thought it might be you.
I just got in from the market. I ran into Jody.
what is it?
Oh, uh, she just told me a really funny joke. - Tell me.
so the patient goes to his doctor and he says, "doctor, if I give up wine, women, and song, will I live longer?
and the doctor says,"well, no. But it'll feel longer.
you don't think that's funny.
I do. - No, you don'T.
are you gonna be home for dinner?
I don't know.
okay, all right. Well, I will see you when you get home.
and I love you, babe, even more for laughing at that joke.
and I love you too. - Bye-bye.
frightening situation like this, two things occur to me.
the first is a song I used to sing to rufus.
our dog.
when he was young, he used to have night terrors.
Hey, Walter, think we can wait down here to be mauled in silence, please?
of course.
so what was the second thing?
you said two things occur to you.
Oh, the second thing.
I need to tinkle.
could eier of you direct me to the facilities?
the facilities?
you're in the sewer, Walter.
you're knee-deep in the facilities.
quite right.
excuse me.
don't say that I never take you anywhere.
Hey, open this up right now.
I'm afraid I can't do that, Peter.
no one else is going to get hurt.
this thing is a mistake, and I'm going to correct it alone.
Walter, hey! Walter, you open this gate right now.
you were right, peter.
I live in a society.
and I need to clean up after myself.
Walter, this is not your fault.
you did not do this.
no, but I could have.
I pursued the same science-- - Walter, walter, you're not prepared for this.
that thing could tear you apart.
that's right. I almost forgot.
I've already considered that possibility.
Walter, is that the trichlorimide?
no, no, no! What are you doing? That's gonna poison you.
should the creature consume me, it will only be poisoning itself.
afterwards, you remove its blood and save agent Francis.
Walter, listen to me, I don't want you to do this. Okay?
do you hear what I'm saying? I do not want you to do this.
should I live, there's an antidote in the lab, which I should ingest within the hour.
so time is of the essence.
Walter. Walter, stop right there.
Walter, come back here! Stop right now! Walter!
selfish son of a bitch.
if he lives through this, I am gonna kill him myself.
Oh, dear god.
are you okay?
Yes.
although when I mentioned that the poison would kill me within the hour, did eitherf you happen to notice the time?
that's it then?
now we wait.
prepare agent Francis for the ultrasound.
what?
sonia and I, we've been talking a lot lately about having a baby.
sorry, I gotta gel you up.
you were right.
what you said before about the consequences,
I don't think of them, never have.
don't know if I can.
that's not who I am.
I know.
but you were brave today.
Yeah.
check in on agent Francis.
let's look in on our little friends.
it didn't work.
ever the pessimist.
look.
they're dying.
what happens now?
now you crap 'em out.
you feel good.
so do you.
no witnesses have come forward at this time.
police have no clues in this bizarre murder that occurred here tonight.
Hello, beautiful.
did you try to call?
I did.
no, I thought I'd call you later.
where were you last night, bob?
I told you I was sleeping.
but I called.
you know I turned off the phone to get some sleep.
Hey, come on, now, you're starting to go down that road again.
before you know it, you'll be all upset.
I think this has more to do with the miles between us, all that dreary weather you're having in portland.
you'll feel much better when you get back tomorrow.
Hey, we'll, uh, we'll do something nice.
I'd like that, bob.
listen, love, right now I've gotta go have dinner with these insufferable suits from hong kong.
I hope it won't be too awful.
you never can tell.
you know what's funny...
before I came in here, I thought I was good-looking.
seriously, though, I can tell you're my type of girl.
how do you know?
I know these things.
I can tell you're my kind of girl.
two singles together was the answer for us.
I'm sorry, two
two singles together.
it's a matchmaking service.
not just a matchmaking service, rachel.
a way of life.
two singles together?
uh, I have my own schedule, works for me.
I have no interest in controlling neil's, either.
I like vacations in the sun and...
and I like the snow.
doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of being in a relationship?
well, I'm-- there are things we agree on, of course.
like, um... where to live. Yeah.
the appropriate kindergarten. Friends we both enjoy.
which, incidentally, I want to make sure ella can attend graham's birthday party.
Oh, I already R. S.V. P.'D on the class sign up.
and, uh, that was for neil's rock climbing party for graham.
my party for graham is the following saturday.
we are doing science center.
excuse me for one minute.
thanks
what?
Greg's filing for divorce.
not now. Not in front of them.
they'll make me join two singles together.
I'm sorry, I've just been called into work.
Oh, what kind of work do you do, olivia?
his girlfriend. Got back from a business trip in portland.
couldn't reach him. Se found him here.
no witnesses.
so this matched the victim that boston P. D.Found two nights ago at the pier?
the one that's been all over the news?
Yeah, they don't know what to make something of.
so now they have another one. Now it's ours to mix up.
you know what this reminds me of, peter?
Nope, but I'm gonna guess it's something unbelievably disgusting.
shrimp cocktail.
you see, the shrimp must be deveined by putting a shallow cut down the back to expose the vein.
which, in fact, is not a vein at all, but the crustaceans intestinal tract.
great, thanks for that. That's another foodstuff I can cross off the menu for life.
Hey, you okay?
Why?
well, you were awfully quiet on the caride over here and you just don't seem your normal, chipper self at a bloody, gruesome crime scene.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm, um...
it's just home stuff.
well, I know from home stuff.
this is fascinating.
these appear to be bite marks.
see how the flesh is ripped and jagged markings.
canine or even ursine, but human.
you're suggesting that someone chewed his spine out?
yes...
but with a jaw strength well in excess of that of a normal human being.
great, well, maybe we're looking for dracula.
finally, son, you're opening your mind to new possibilities.
but, no, there are no vampires, sadly.
but it'll be something exciting, I'm sure.
we have another monster on the loose?
uh, no, sir. Walter says that the teeth marks are definitely human.
I can just about remember when a suspect being human was a given, not an option.
Bob dunn's girlfriend said that he had a car, an audi a-4.
it wasn't in the garage, and we couldn't find it when we did a two-block sweep.
local P. D.Is on it.
Yeah, we could get lucky. Maybe the killer took it.
and dr. Bishop?
he's at the lab with both bodies, doing autopsies.
okay, well, let me know if you learn anything.
is there something else?
this may sound impolitic, sir, but I was wondering if you were satisfied with your divorce attorney.
I've heard you talking on the phone to your kids, but never to your wife.
I was satisfied. Except for the bill.
I was wondering if I might be able to get the name and number.
it should be waiting in your in box.
thank you.
I hope things work out for your sister.
I pay attention too, agent dunham.
the c-1 cervical vertebra is connected to the c-2 cervical vertebra.
c-2 cervical vertebra is connected to the c-3
That--walter. That's enough.
when you finally meet a nice girl, I would avoid bringing her home for as long as possible.
Walter, this is the lab work you requested on the victims.
excellent.
it may help us understand why their spinal columns have been completely drained of spinal fluid.
the killer took the victims' spinal fluid?
why would they do that?
where would the fun be if we already knew all there is to know?
this is interesting.
traces of treponema pallidum.
that's the syphilis bacteria.
on the victim's neck and back.
most likely from the killer's saliva.
so the killer has syphilis.
seems so. - Great.
and what's even more fascining, this particular strain of syphilis is extinct.
has been for decades.
well, how could the killer be exposed to an extinct strain of syphilis?
see, isn't this fun?
I appreciate the cdc's prompt response on this matter.
of course. I ran an index search.
a sample of that particular strain of syphilis was shipped out four weeks ago to a lubov pharmaceuticals.
they have a local address on brighton.
well, thank you, but a phone call would have sufficed.
actually, I'm not sure that it would have.
I took the liberty of running the rest of lubov's research requests over the past few years.
this isn't the first contagion they've ordered from us.
in fact, there have been quite a few.
any reputable scientist with the appropriate credentials can procure sample of bacteria and viruses for their research.
in addition to the extinct syphilis bacteria, lubov pharmaceuticals also procured a sample of a substance called rud-390.
which is...
a chemical compound us in the construction of bioweapons.
you're suggesting whoever's behind these killings may al be planning a biological attack?
or has before.
Rud-390 was one of the components of the rapid skin growth toxin that killed agent kent.
you're saying this is Z. F.T?
Z. F.T?
we believe Z. F.T. Is a terrorist organization...
responsible for a number of bio attacks in the last year.
I see. Why? What is their agenda?
that's what we wanna find out.
assemble an assault squad. Move on lubov.
Yes, sir.
federal agents. You're under arrest.
Dr. Nicholas boone.
advanced degrees in hematology and biochemistry.
founder of lubov pharmaceuticals, a multinational biotech firm whose corporate offices turn out to be in a split level in brighton.
they're human bite marks.
what is out there doing this?
what happened to these people?
how long have you been a follower of Z. T?
that's right, dr. Boone.
we know about Z. F.T.
what do you know?
enough to know that they're using the world as a testing ground for experiments.
we want to know more about david robert jones, about who funds Z. F.T. And why.
we want to know what we're dealing with.
I don't have to spell it out for you, dr. Boone.
you talk to us, give us information.
help us with whatever's out there killing people.
it'll go better for you.
what is doing this?
what have you done?
someone was dosed.
with what?
dosed with what?
I know a lot about the things you want. And more.
and I'll answer your questions.
but you have to help me first.
help with what?
they have my wife.
I want you to get her back.
Z. F.T. Has your wife?
what counts with punishme is the ability to know whom to turn, and when.
you're telling me Z. F.T.'S coercing you to conduct these experiments by threatening to harm your wife.
why would they be punishing you?
because when I realized what my work was being used for, I tried to get out.
I'll tell you everything you want to know.
but first, you have to get my wife back.
do you believe him?
I don'T.
Boone's wife is a nurse.
I checked with her hospital, and she hasn't been to work in three weeks.
proves nothing.
I'm inclined to agree with agent francis.
everything we know about these guys suggests that they're zealots.
why don't we go back in there, as them why the sudden change of heart?
we can't ask him a thing until we get his wife.
could be a trap. - Could be the truth.
I'm sorry, but since I've been working in fringe division, 81 people have lost their lives.
and that's not including the 147 on flight 627.
now, in my entire career, only nine peop have died on cases that I worked.
this is the closest that we've ever come to getting traction and stopping these people.
getting a handle on C. F.T. Jones... or more.
this guy could be our chance.
what is it?
the address boone gave us, where he says they're holding his wife.
it's a restaurant... in chinatown.
doesn't exactly scream Z. F.T. Hive of activity.
they're burning five times more power a month than they should making moo shoo pork.
they could be using the power for something else.
maybe to facilitate a laboratory?
go get 'em.
Peter and walter bishop.
we're here to catalog the chemical evidence.
Walter bishop. Nice to meet you.
hello. Oh, no, please sit down. Bishop, walter bishop.
Walter, you don't have to shake everybody's hand.
he gets a little nervous around authority figures.
Oh, boy.
look at that.
benzyl alcohol.
colorless liquid used as a bacteriostatic in solutions for injection, topically as a local anesthetic.
what did this guy create?
from what I've seen so far, I am forming a hypothesis. Would you care to hear it?
well, I don't know.
would I ever be able to sleep at night again.
well, that depends. - Depends on what?
on whether the light is on or not.
there's four exits.
risk and walken, you take the rear.
Taub and brown, you take the side.
Dunham and I are gonna be in the front with the rest of you.
and remember, this is a hostile situation in a contained environment.
so retrieving the hostage unharmed is our top priority.
Yes, ma'am. - Dunham.
Greg wants full custody of ella. - What?
another process server just came by.
Greg is claiming that I am an unfit parent.
that "the minor's mental and physical well-being "would be best served under the sole custody of the petitioner.
he can't be serious.
I won't let that happen, liv.
I will run if I have to.
I will take her and I will dippear, I swear to god.
okay, rachel, rachel... just calm down.
you're not running anywhere, and you're not gonna lose ella.
he's just doing this to hurt me.
okay, rachel, listen to me.
now, this is just one of those things that you're gonna look back on and you're gonna say, "I beat that too." Do you hear me?
I hear you.
okay.
so, um, look, let's talk when I get home. I-I've got A...
I gotta go to a meeting.
okay.
we got that meeting.
Freeze!
F. B.I! - Get your ass on the floor!
Claire? - Claire!
your wife isn't there.
I know that.
I need to talk to agent dunham.
Dunham. - I'm putting him on.
agent dunham.
what the hell's going on?
there's a room in the back. Can you see it?
Yeah, we checked. She's not there.
I know, but what I need is.
okay, I'm here.
in front of you, you should see a row of refrigeration units.
third from the right. - Yeah, I see it.
open it.
you know, I'm not gonna do a thing until you tell me why we're here.
we're getting to that. - No, you tell me now.
inside that cooling unit you'll find a contagion, five vials marked xt43.
the person who's out there killing has been dosed with this.
I need it to make an antidote.
you lied to me? - No.
agent dunham...
they didn't kidnap my wife.
the infected her.
it's she who's out there killing.
Valerie boone, you turn march into june.
okay, that's enough. You be on camera. I always do this.
I have no interest in being on camera. - Come on, you.
are we both in? Okay, that's me. Hello.
us in the park!
you are so beautiful.
you are really warm.
you're burning up.
What--what's wrong?
you're my kind of guy.
C
p You wanna pay specific attention to the date.
whoever wore a lab coat and rubber gloves.
Valerie boone, you turn march into june.
okay, that's enough. You be on camera. I always do this.
I have no interest in being on camera. - Come on, you.
hello.
us in the park! - Where is--okay. Look out. Okay.
there, okay, that's it. - No, no, no! That's not it.
there he goes.
Oh, my god, you look like you ran in the trash can.
that video was taken three weeks ago, dr. Boone.
she needs to feed.
she can't control it.
I began to feed her my own spinal fluid.
the more I gave, the more she craved, until...
I couldn't give anymore.
the contagion burns through her spinal fluid faster than her body can replace it.
when she kills, it's simply to...
refuel.
I tried to synthesize the antidote on my own, watching her suffer the effects of being infected.
but I couldn't do it.
not without a dose of the bacteria to work from.
for the rest of my life, this chair will remind me of what I've done.
why would Z. F.T. Want you to create something like this?
to create a human nightmare.
the syphilis was just a platform.
carrier for other attributes.
attributes that changed her.
for what purpose.
for the same reason they asked me to...
create the skin growth toxin... to show off.
to who?
other scientists.
you mean nothing to them.
so how many vials were created?
just the ones that I took?
I made six, now accounted for, but I can't guarantee they won't pick up where I left off.
if they did figure out how to make it, could they weaponize this bacteria?
you really don't know who you're dealing with.
the answer for both of us is to let me make a cure.
now that y've recovered the dose samples, I can make it.
my offer still stands.
I'll tell you everything I know when you find her.
if the cure works, we both win.
now I'll need access to a lab with a blood analyzer.
I'll also need a spectroscope and a centrifuge.
you might want torite this down.
that won't be a problem.
you really think it's a good idea to let him have free reign in walter's believe-it-or-not emporium?
Oh, and this is something my son peter is working on.
I haven't got the faintest idea what it is.
your centrifuge is 20 years old.
Oh, 25. It's an oldie, but a goody.
I also have a cow.
and, just for the record, one mad scientist is my limit.
I think that having him help walter is our best chance at saving lives.
Dunham.
we found bob dunn's car.
clear across town, in mission hill.
it's completely stripped.
quarter panels, radio, everything.
the gps? - No, it's gone.
I was hoping we might have been able to track where he picked up boone's wife that night.
okay, thanks, charlie.
uh, good news, peter.
nicholas and i are in agreement.
Yes, we need to purify the mold, then ferment it.
to the highest possible concentration.
can you, uh, call me if something else turns up? Okay, bye.
great news. They made a breakthrough.
they're gonna fight the super syphilis with super penicillin.
syphilis was the platform.
if they can kill the syphilis, they can stop the contagion.
right. Well, charlie just found dunn's car, stripped in mission hill.
excellent. He check the gps? - Stolen.
well, everything stolen is not necessarily lost.
meaning what?
meaning if there's a car found stripped in the greater boston area,
I can guarantee you my man mako has his big toe in it.
Oh, you have a friend who runs a chop shop? - Yeah.
you make that sound so illegal.
let's just say the gps is here... allegedly.
but it's useless because it's been wiped for resale.
hypothetically.
we're trying to track a killer, mr. Mako.
Nah, it's just mako. You know, like "cher.
theoretically, if the gps is wiped, then that would put you in a rough spot, because you'd be hampering a federal investigation.
I'm trying to work with you here.
we need the gps to find out where the victim was the night of his killing.
but you stole his car from his home in brookline.
I didn't steal his car from brookline.
Where'd you steal it from?
if I tell you where we boosted that car, can we just say that this conversation never happened?
hypothetically? Sure.
route 18th, weymouth.
fascinating.
105 degrees.
then the rat's successfully infected.
this strain of syphilis raises the body temperature well above normal.
the cure is nearly complete.
once this penicillin concentrates, we can test it on the rat.
where did you study, nicholas?
at the curie institute in paris.
kings college, aberdeen, scotland.
it's quite a fall.
it's an honor to have your intellect in my lab.
that's high praise.
because I know very well who you are.
well... that makes one of us.
a little memory loss is often kd to the soul.
that a figure of speech?
or do you believe there is such a thing? The soul.
there are days when I wish I D.
there are days when I wish I didn'T.
I often wake up at night, frightened, with the understanding that there are things man shouldn't know.
that the scientific trespasses I've committed
will one day be judged.
belly and I would often debate this very thing.
william bell. You've heard of him?
of course. Founder of massive dynamic, richest man in the world.
we used to share a lab.
quite a fall.
if indeed there is a soul, we must consider then that there is still time for redemption.
we're not being hauled off to be judged yet, nicholas.
this must be where mako boosted the car.
all the shattered glass.
so we're thinking what?
Boone's wife kills this guy, steals his car, and then drives it out here?
Yeah.
but what was she doing here?
and where did she go?
you know what I hate worst than the cold?
what? - Not much.
think I know why she came out here.
the camera, aspirin.
okay. Ready.
we are about to inject the infected rat with an antidote.
should it pre effective, it will no doubt work on humans as well.
now we wait.
marvelous. This way, gentlemen.
we've been expecting you.
may I offer you a peak freen?
a delicious vanilla wafer with raspberry center and lemon cream.
he doesn't want a cookie, walter.
apparently, you're wrong.
one we found in the forest in weymouth.
the other on the street in roxbury.
where is she getting her victims?
you must have some idea where she'd go.
well, she wouldn't recognize me...
let alone find comfort in places she knows.
this one's been drinking. He smells like a brewery.
Hey, peter, will you turn out the lights?
all right, peter.
I orded it on television.
it's an entry stamp.
the industrial area is really happening in the underground club scene right now.
so she's going to the club to find these victims.
look, I need more time to make the cure.
please.
if you take her alive, I know I can save her.
I'll see what I can do.
what is that?
it's a hand-held thermal imaging radiometer.
it tells me if you're hot.
so...
so you're definitely hot.
I'm looking for someone with syphilis.
uh, okay.
I don't understand. Something's wrong. Something's missing.
the rat's body has rejected the cure.
perhaps a protein incompatibility.
no, it's not that. I know what's wrong.
the contagion required cerebral spinal fluid as a catalyst.
and the cure must require some as well.
bond the cure to the contagion.
Yes, and the only spinal fluid we know for a fact is compatible...
is my own.
well, no, that's out of the question. It's too dangerous.
if you lose more spinal fluid it could cause a brain hemorrhage.
no, I was very careful to monitor the amount of fluid I removed.
another 25 milliliters should be safe.
Walter... we can'T.
we have no other choice!
prep the table, agent farnsworth.
thank you.
anything?
no, not yet.
I got her.
she was right there, but she's gone now.
okay...
Hey, charlie?
come on up.
here we go. Gently. Yes. Okay, gently, gently, gently.
all right? - Yes, thanks.
HARLIE. charlie, I think she's headed to you.
what's she wearing?
black dress and freakishly blue eyes.
on it.
it's
I just got off the phone with olivia.
good news, dr. Boone. They have her.
Oh, excellent.
Dr. Boone? Walter...
get me a tpa injection.
you lied to me.
you let me take too much spinal fluid.
how far would you go for someone you love?
how's she doing?
Where's the siren on this thing?
there.
Ishat why you wanted to drive?
everybody should get to do this at least once before they die.
that looks says more than just, "I wish I hadn't have let him drive.
I was just thinking about nicholas boone and what he did for his wife.
what he is doing. Jeez, that kind of love.
Greg asked rachel for a divorce, and now he's fighting her for custody.
you know, I never liked that guy. - You've never met greg.
Yeah, but I met your sister. So I know she deserves better.
and I thought you were a card-carrying cynic.
I am, world class.
but there's an argument to be made that beneath every cynic, there is a frustrated romantic.
Peter!
thank you.
good. Bring her in, strap her down.
Walter, what happened?
he had a stroke.
pulse is strong. - Yeah, so is she.
agent farnsworth, 30ccs of the antidote, please.
thank you. - You're welcome.
okay, now what? - Now we wait.
Walter... - No! Let her!
is she...
seems to be working.
agent farnsworth...
prepare a solution, 30 parts saline.
and some adrenaline and perhaps a cup of coffee.
he's gone.
Dr. Boone asked me to give thiso you personally, agent dunham.
what is it, walter?
agent dunham, if you're watching this, I suspect I didn't make it.
but you and I had a bargain, and, uh, you held up your end.
now, I have made many mistakes in my life, but in the end,
I should at least be a man of my word.
and I promised you answers.
with any luck, you will use them to rectify some of my misdeeds.
now, in the time I worked with Z. F.T.
I never dealt with anyon of significant rank within the movement.
but I was able to gather some names, including some I suspect you've already heard of.
Dunham.
are you all right? - Yeah.
uh, nicholas boone talked.
he told us everything he knew about Z. F.T.
did he mention david robert jones?
no, he said he'd never heard of him.
but he did mention another name that we've heard before.
according to boone, the man who's funding Z. F.T...
is william bell.
a series of events has occured.
these events appear to be scientific in nature.
it's being referred to as the pattern.
he worked out of harvard. In an area called fringe science.
you're telling me my father was dr. Frankenstein.
you were in an accident.
you were missing from your car for at least an hour before you came crashing back through the windshield.
what if there's a part of my brain that's trying to protect me?
what's this? - Sam weiss--the man who helped put me back together.
have the headaches started yet? - No.
they will.
none of that vanilla hazelnut crap.
normal coffee, all right?
I already called it in.
Yes, colonel? - It's time. Get to suburban station.
he'll be wearing a black trench coat carrying a black briefcase.
gillespie, seriously, for the last time, where are you?
set the briefcase down now.
what's this about? What did i do?
you give me the briefcase now.
what's the problem here? - Got it under control. Give me the case.
Hey, stop! You can't do that! You can't take that!
officer, what's the matter?
the rabbit goes around the tree then through the hole.
Yeah, i know how to tie my shoes.
knowing how isn't the issue.
you suffered some wicked head trauma.
don't think about your hands, don't think about the laces.
your shoes will get tied just fine.
Yeah, just by magic. - No.
but that would be pretty cool.
you know, what exactly did you do for nina sharp?
I taught her how to eat french fries.
you know, pick one up, dip it in the ketchup, stick it in your mouth, repeat.
simple enough, unless you've got a cybernetic prosthetic arm.
Nina was a mess.
see, i prefer the bunny ears method to the one loop wrap.
but it does require more coordination.
you'll get there.
don't take this the wrong way, but i can't waste my time.
are you sleeping at night?
you've got circles around your eyes, pale skin...
you don't get more than two or three hours at a stretch, do you?
lingering pain from the accident?
in my leg and my shoulder.
and you say the headaches haven't started yet?
no.
well, let me know when they do.
you can take the shoes off now, we're done.
that's it?
Yeah, unless you want me to mop up the men's room. I'm closing now.
come back tomorrow, agent dunham. We've got work to do.
all right, how about this one?
two bedroom, two bath loft in oak square.
cook's kitchen, hardwood floors, and a breakfast nook.
does it face the east?
no. Riverview, so it faces north.
then it won't do. I need the morning sun.
fine, how about this?
three bedroom duplex in allston, facing east.
all the morning sun a waking scientist could want.
I never liked allston.
Arlington either, for that matter.
I'm perfectly happy with our present accommodations.
well, i'm not, walter. I need my own bedroom.
I woke up this morning to him singing an aria from pagliacci.
your father has a wonderful voice.
not when he's doing jumping jacks.
and did i mention he was naked?
a good morning sets the tone for the day.
hey guys, come take a look at this.
I've been running a filter for atypical fbi reports. I just got a hit.
some sort of bomb went off in philadelphia.
single explosive device. 11 dead, 28 wounded.
this last part is what caught my eye.
they can't find any explosive residue at the scene.
how's a bomb go off without leaving any trace of it afterwards?
shall i get my coat, peter?
I'll call dunham.
Farnsworth, get my portable chemistry set.
this means bodies.
the bomb guys don't know what to make of it.
they say, given the nature of the wounds, you'd expect an explosive device filled with nails or steel ball bearings.
but it wasn't. - No. In fact...
there's no forensic markers at all.
so what about eye witnesses?
Oh, i've got half a dozen eye witnesses, but nobody who saw anything helpful.
huh, it's weird. This place has major anti-terrorism security.
EMP disabling devices at every entrance, explosive materials sensors...
we checked, and not a single sensor is tripped.
so what did the surveillance cameras show?
nothing, nothing but magnetic static.
it seems that whatever happened in here wiped the images.
would you mind if we see those tapes? - I'll see what i can do.
let me guess, you got a friend?
maybe i do. - Excuse me, sir? Do you have a badge?
no, i don't have a badge. Do you?
I got it. Walter... What's going on?
this rather unpleasant young woman is interfering with my work.
is he with you? - Yeah, but don't hold that against me.
we're fbi. - Go ahead.
so? What is it?
shrapnel, i believe, from the bomb.
some sort of crystal.
hard as a diamond.
salty. Silica, i guess.
well, i'll need to examine the rest of the bodies, if-- if that's all right with you, miss.
thank you.
agent dunham...
I spoke with our counter-terrorism analysts.
no one stepped forward to claim responsibility.
and there's been no increase in chatter from our usual suspects.
Hey, guys, i found this wedged in a bench.
it's a badge--philly p. D. officer gillespie.
were there any police among the wounded taken to the hospital?
so, where'd he go? - Peter!
I was wrong. The crystal...
I think it's not geologic in origin, after all.
in fact, i'm certain it's organic.
is that an ear?
well...I think walter might have just 8
this looks like fungiform papillae.
taste buds. - Tongue.
Walter, as much as i am enjoying this anatomy lesson, what exactly are we doing here?
well, that's obvious, my dear. We're searching for clues.
scientific evidence to reveal what type of device this man was wearing which caused him to harden then shatter.
I understand peter's looking for a new place for you guys to live.
it occurs to me, agent farnsworth, that i've never asked you where you live.
where i live? - Yeah. Diaphragm.
well... Most of the time i live here.
but my apartment is in sommerville.
you should go for a walk sometime explore the neighborhood.
the other day i turned the wrong way in the street, and discovered that busby's...
has the world's best apple fritters.
you see, i have everything i need where we live now.
I know what you mean, walter.
I'm a creature of habit, too.
of course, you never would've found busby's apple fritters if you hadn't gone the wrong way down a street.
you really should try them, they're quite delicious. Brain.
okay, that's it. That's the best i can do.
well, that must be gillespie.
but i don't see a bomb.
then it cuts out.
you know, i told her you were a genius, joe. Don't prove me wrong.
then you're gonna need a smarter genius.
do you have any idea how something like this could happen?
the static? No. Maybe radio wave interference.
certain high frequencies can tweak electronic signals.
look at the time code.
that's about 20 seconds before the bomb went off.
so why do we lose picture before the explosion?
how's it going, walter? Any theories?
several.
Peter, do you remember that jigsaw puzzle we put together when you were a kid?
the jigsaw? No.
as i recall, her name was melissa... Something.
500 pieces. - Yes.
Yes, i do remember. Melissa was a playmate. Miss july, right?
putting together a jigsaw of a nude centerfold was walter's idea of how to explain
what was it? Human reproduction to his ten-year-old son.
so what does any of that have to do with the bomb in philadelphia?
patience, son. Voila.
meet officer gillespie.
fantastic.
so apart from the obvious, anything out of the ordinary?
needle marks between the toes.
it was some form of transformative serum, i would think.
I can't say what yet.
from his tissues, it appears to cause a chemical reaction on the cellular level that both solidified the water in his cells and emitted massive energy, which shattered the body.
what are you saying, walter? You think he did this to himself? On purpose?
well, i stopped counting at 47 needle marks.
I can't imagine it was an accident.
when you think about it...
wearing a bomb is rather unimaginative.
this way there's no need to smuggle in an explosive device, because
officer gillespie was the bomb.
fascinating, yes?
we were planning to start a family.
I can't believe he's not coming home.
Dan always came home.
after every shift on the job, two tours in iraq, he always came home.
no one would tell me what happened.
just that it was... Some kind of bomb.
we're still investigating. I'm so sorry.
where was he stationed?
in ramadi.
did you serve?
no, a civilian contractor, based out of baghdad.
but from what i remember, there was heavy avfighting in ramadi.
was he on any medication, or under any sort of medical care?
no. No, dan was healthy.
and i don't understand, what does this have to do with the explosion?
you all right, dunham?
excuse me, do you have a bathroom that i could use?
Yeah, it's down the hall.
Dunham, you all right?
Mrs. Gillespie, can you tell me what these are?
I don't know. I've never seen them before.
Dan gillespie doesn't fit the profile of a suicide bomber.
well, how do you explain this stuff?
cause i'm assuming it's more than likely that this is exactly what walter was talking about.
what turned him into a bomb.
Yeah, well, i can't yet.
but i mean, what makes someone blow themselves up?
typically, they're either waging a war, or making a statement.
gillespie was a dedicated cop and soldier just getting his life back together.
it doesn't make sense.
is there anything else on your mind?
like what?
the headache. Didn't the doctor say that would happen?
uh, they said they might.
that it was totally normal.
we should get that back to walter.
maybe he can figure out where those vials came from.
let me help you with that. - Colonel.
we need to talk, captain burgess.
I'm calling you back to active status.
you're going to d. C.On friday.
hotel reservations, plane tickets all--self-explanatory.
that phone, keep it with you at all times.
check into the hotel, wait for me to call you with further instructions.
do you have a cover story prepared for your family?
Yes, sir. I'll say i'm visiting my sister. She lives in georgetown.
have you been taking the serum?
Yes, sir.
good, because from this moment on tin man parameters are in effect.
so... How'd you know?
the headaches started.
well, it's about time.
can you just cut the yoda crap and tell me what's happening to me?
the short version...
the headaches mean you've finally sparked the battery.
you've been experiencing...
an acute nominal aphasia, agent dunham.
it's common with head trauma.
parts of your brain are still asleep.
once they wake up, all that memory will get flushed out.
when? - When?
when will i get my memory back?
you know, everywhere you go the scoring apparatuses have changed.
computers, no fun.
here, we do things old school, with a dull pencil and all your third grade math skills.
you know, this is ridiculous.
I'm not bowling, i can't even walk without this damn cane.
you're not bowling. I've got a kid's league coming in here, you're gonna keep score.
how is that gonna help my memory?
I mean, how is that gonna help me at all?
well, for starters, it might teach you some patience.
Ah, is that food i smell? Bless you!
while examining officer gillespie, i've discovered something else.
given the amount of serum that we found in his tissue, and the rate at which it would've metabolized, i suspect that he would've had to inject it every day for a very long time.
well, how long?
at least a year, i would think.
a year?
that would mean gillespie started injecting while he was still on his tour in iraq.
did his army personnel file come through yet?
I haven't seen it. Let me check though.
Oh, yeah. Interestingly...
when the serum is first introduced or injected, it's fairly harmless.
but then something else occurs, a secondary reaction.
some sort of trigger causes these bombs to blast apart.
the triggers-- - peter...
if you are going to eat that cheeseburger in here, could you at least be a little discreet?
fine. This trigger, could it be a radio wave?
there was some sort of interference on the security tapes inside the train station.
most likely caused by radio waves.
Yes. I suppose so.
Peter, i've got gillespie's military file.
what's 'cyanogen chloride'?
it's a chemical weapon.
his unit was exposed to cyanogen?
according to this file, gillespie should've died in iraq.
four words that should never show up in a sentence.
classified experimental military project.
how much you wanna bet that tin man has everything to do with those injections that gillespie was taking?
it says here that project tin man was shut down.
shortly after dan gillespie returned home.
and all names of u. S.Military personnel associated with the project were redacted from the record.
but it still lists malik yusef, abbas khalef, and howard ziad as iraqi doctors who worked on the program.
where are they?
presumably still in the country.
CENTCOM has agreed to look for them, but it may take a few weeks to track anything down.
I may be able to help.
but i'm gonna need a few things first.
I need to go back to iraq.
I know somebody who can help us find those doctors.
seems a long way to go for a maybe.
well, we have to assume that gillespie was not a solitary event.
there may be others out there like him, walking bombs, we don't have two weeks to wait.
what is it you need?
private air transportation, $20, 000 in cash, and a passport without my real name on it.
I'm still on a couple of watch lists.
then you're gonna need a federal agent with you as well.
I'm reluctant to send you, agent dunham.
with that said, we need to keep this trip between us.
you look after each other.
you ready for this?
maybe i should wait outside.
then what would i do? You're the one with a gun.
in that case, we speak english.
I need your help, ahmed.
a u. S.Military program named tin man.
it's operating out of a hospital in samarra.
I need to find one of your iraqi doctors who was working in that program.
I can pay you, of course.
when i heard you had been killed, i knew this could not be true.
because a person like you is good at one thing.
more than anything else, a person like you is good at looking out for yourself.
now you are here... Asking for my help?
Yes, i am.
maybe someone else will want your money. I don't.
a lot of innocent lives may be on the line.
I see. And this is something you care about now?
Yes, i do.
I may be able to save them... With your help.
what are the names of these doctors?
have some tea. I will see what i can do.
you gonna tell me what that was about?
no.
doctor bishop, what did i tell you about experimenting with fruit?
I just cleaned this lab up yesterday.
relax, my dear.
just injecting a very small amount of the serum into the watermelon.
just to crystallize it.
the serum we found at gillespie's house told us how he became a bomb.
but the question remains, what triggered it?
so you're using radio waves like peter suggested?
Yes.
radio waves would also explain the eyewitness reports of flashing lights at the train station before the officer exploded.
quite ingenious, really.
the same principal applied to proximity fuses, and world war ii ariel bombs...
in fact, my uncle henry was killed by one in the battle of the guadalcanal.
Oh, astrid! This is it!
quickly, what's the frequency? - 331. 6 megahertz.
what happened? It stopped.
I'm not sure.
it works.
no more fruit, walter.
ready for something a little harder than tea?
sure.
red russian? - Yeah, mint tea and vodka.
sounds weird and awful.
actually it's worse.
you'll get used to it. - How long were you here?
which time? I had to leave a couple of times.
seems like you made a name for yourself.
I've been known to leave an impression.
to all that's weird.
doctor malik yusef...
they consider me a threat.
we were hoping to ask you some questions about a program that you worked on.
a program called tin man.
no, i do not know anything about this.
the program didn't work, it was too dangerous.
the soldiers had been exposed to a synthetic neurotoxin, a nerve agent developed under saddam.
cyanogen? - Yes.
we had been trying to find a way to neutralize it to counteract the affects.
and that's what they called tin man?
we had developed a... A treatment.
daily injections of a serum.
we treated over 200 soldiers.
only a few of them survived.
we know of one, a daniel gillespie.
Daniel, kind man.
um, over the course of the program, there were three others.
do you remember their names?
of course, i saved their lives.
it was joan klump, ross cavanaugh, and diane burgess.
okay, diane, you're all set. Suitcase is at the front door.
are you sure you don't want me to drive you to the airport?
but it was too dangerous.
the serum had an unintentional byproduct.
we had discovered that after it built up in human tissue.
it reacted in a very unexpected way.
it turned people into bombs. - Yes.
how did you know that?
doctor yusef, how many other people knew about this?
five doctors, a dozen u. S.Officers, and whoever they reported to, i suppose.
someone is triggering these people to explode. It could be anyone.
there was a man, a colonel.
when the program was shut down, he argued it should be continued.
do you remember his name?
Gordon. Colonel raymond gordon.
a word of warning... Gordon is a vicious man.
ets in front of you, so i'll just point out the highlights.
information has come to this agency that a bomb may be detonated today somewhere in this city.
but in this instance, that bomb is a human being.
three of the four known operatives of project tin man have been accounted for.
Daniel gillespie you're all familiar with.
two others have been taken into protective custody.
which leaves diane burgess.
we believe captain burgess traveled to d. C. This morning, under an alias.
though we do not have any intelligence on her potential target.
a bolo has been issued to all metro and state police in the area.
all potential high-value targets are under close surveillance.
agent dunham and i will coordinate captain burgess' apprehension. Agent dunham?
based on our investigation, it's likely there is a second suspect controlling detonation from a remote location.
we believe it's this man, colonel raymond gordon.
the pentagon lost contact with colonel gordon six months ago.
he's off the grid.
officially designated a rogue operative.
now based on dr. Bishop's analysis, the explosion is triggered by a specific vhf frequency.
if we can locate captain burgess in time to get within range, we may be able to jam the signal and prevent her detonation.
on that point, we suspect that diane burgess is unaware she is being used in a suicide bombing.
which means that she is also a potential victim here.
we're gonna do everything that we can to get her back to her family alive.
Diane burgess has just been located.
she's in a d. C.Metro cab.
dispatchers say she's headed to the federal center metro station.
we have time to set up before she arrives.
our objectives are as follows; to prevent the detonation of captain diane burgess and to apprehend colonel raymond gordon.
this is broyles, go ahead.
video surveillance and 3-d triangulation model online.
stand by, we'll wait for diane burgess.
snipers ready.
target sited, arriving at federal center station, south portal.
the phone's encrypted, sir. We can't tap into it.
there's no sign of the colonel outside of the station.
copy that, keep an eye on it.
where are we on that signal? - Attempting to acquire signal 331. 6 megahertz.
excuse me, agent broyles...
is there an emp detection device in this station?
all capitol transportation hubs had them installed after 911.
what's the problem? - No problem.
it's just that the security device can scramble all types of radio wave triggers.
that sounds to me like a good thing.
frequency acquired. Jamming. Ready.
prepare to jam the signal.
stand by to apprehend target.
I'm thinking that if the colonel wants ms. Burgess inside the building.
then in order to trigger the explosion, he must be inside as well.
which means that once he starts broadcasting, we should be able to triangulate his position.
but in order to do that, we'd have to leave the frequency open.
we can't jam it.
this could be our only chance to find gordon and apprehend him.
target's about to enter the station.
do we move, sir?
I said stand by.
how long from when he activates the signal until she detonates?
30 seconds, at best.
that should give us long enough to be able to locate him.
all units hold position. Let the target get into the building.
go.
Yes, colonel?
your contact will be wearing a black trench coat.
he will have a briefcase for you.
accept the briefcase and proceed by taxi back to your hotel.
is that it, sir? - That's it, captain. I'll meet you there.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
according to this schematic, diane burgess should be standing near the northwest side of the terminal.
we're still waiting for gordon to activate the vhf signal.
I got her. She's by the front entrance.
keep an eye on her.
do we have anything from gordon yet?
the signal hasn't been activated yet, sir.
she's on the move. Still no sign of gordon.
that--that's it. That's the vhf signal. She'll detonate in 30 seconds.
agent, tell me where gordon is.
something's wrong. Sir, the signal's scrambling our equipment.
I can't get a lock on gordon.
the signal is scrambling our equipment.
I think you have something for me.
one mississippi... Two mississippi... 30 seconds.
I don't know what you're talking about.
okay, we've got her speaking to a man with a briefcase. It is not gordon.
can you get a lock on the signal?
if we can't get a lock, then jam that signal.
we're jamming the signal, i'm not risking his life to get gordon.
sir, it's--it's not working. The signal's too strong for our equipment.
I'm locked out. - We have a problem.
Dunham, attempts to jam the signal have failed.
we have a problem. The signal cannot be jammed. I repeat, the signal...
Peter, i think we just lost radio contact. We need to find gordon.
copy that. The trigger's been activated, we don't have much time.
I don't know who you are.
Oh, my god!
I spotted gordon. I'm taking him out.
four mississippi. Five mississippi. Six mississippi.
we're back online, the signal has stopped.
all agents move in.
what's this? - An apartment.
two bedroom, semi-detached.
furnished housing for professors.
it's a nice neighborhood.
down the block from where belly used to live.
I'll call broyles, see if we can lease it.
okay, seven and a quarter inches.
why "hmm"?
well, i think your hand just seems smaller to me.
okay, we're good.
we're good, what does that mean?
it means that's all for tonight. Go home.
I just got here.
I know, but i'm tired. It's been a long day.
you look like you could use some sleep yourself.
come back tomorrow. By then i'll have found you the perfect bowling ball.
now you listen to me you son of a bitch.
I am not here to bowl, or to try on shoes, or to have you play games with my head.
I am here because i was told that you could fix me.
take care, agent dunham.
meanwhile, we go through our lives unaware.
the enemy is among us and nobody's doing anything about it.
we don't have any idea the end is coming.
so we had to take matters into our own hands.
we had to send them a message.
what was in the briefcase?
they told you i was crazy, didn't they?
the pentagon.
they said i'd had a psychiatric break.
I told them what i'm telling you.
that they are here.
collecting data.
making observations.
that's what's in the briefcase.
they've been planning for war.
and they've been passing the information via courier right under our noses.
who are "they"?
we don't know who they are.
but i can tell you what they want.
they want to exterminate us.
so they're studying us...
our culture, our technology, our science...
and they plan to use it against us.
one way or another.
we'll find out who they are.
but by then, i suppose it won't really matter.
because whatever's in those cases is gonna destroy us all.
the last will and testament of William Bell.
Nina, a memento of me.
I need Belly. I need his help. I can't do this alone.
I have to protect our world.
remember how good we were together.
william is gone.
you can't bring him back.
wherever Belly is...
he will find us.
the decoder key is in my office.
at the FBI?
no, at Massive Dynamic.
I understand your concerns, but I assure you, Olivia is perfectly fine.
she is simply resting.
what do you mean, she's resting?
well, not exactly of course.
just in the sense that her conscious mind, her awareness, is at a state of rest.
but I assure you, she is totally safe.
this is all exactly as I planned it.
you haven't heard the best part.
ask him when he planned it.
several months ago when I first met Olivia in my office on the other side.
I gave her a cup of tea.
the soul magnets were in that tea.
so these soul magnets drew your consciousness into Olivia after you died?
well, after my physical body died.
as you can see, I am quite alive.
indeed. Look at this.
two distinct patterns of electrical activity.
this one... active.
that's you, Belly.
the other one inert.
like the brain waves of a long, dreamless sleep.
which suggests that Olivia was aware of none of this.
now I understand that this could take some time for you to get used to.
imagine how I feel.
I never realized that a bra was so binding.
Astrid, you can start taking the electrodes off her... him.
how much time?
you're not suggesting this is permanent.
Oh, no, no.
we simply need to find a more suitable home for me to move to.
now Olivia's brain can accommodate my consciousness for several weeks before anything would happen to her.
and I am confident that Walter will find a more stable home long before that.
24 hours. 48 at the most.
has anyone ever told you, dear, that you have lovely hands?
thank you.
you're not seriously considering sanctioning this, are you?
well, what would you suggest, Peter?
if I leave Olivia's brain now without finding a suitable host, I would die.
and don't you think that my life is worth an extended nap?
and besides, William can help us understand Walternate's plan, can't you, William?
Walter. - What he intends to use the machine for.
and how to keep Peter out of it. - Stop.
I want to know how we get Olivia back.
48 hours to find a new and suitable host.
then I want you out of my agent.
or I'll have Dr. Bishop figure out how to drive you out. Agreed?
you have my word, young man.
now I need to retrieve my files from Massive Dynamic.
there is a box labeled "Reentry.
I'll get it myself. - As fast as possible.
you don't have to tell me twice.
that was fast.
you said I didn't have much time, Jim.
you didn't.
you don't.
you were right.
it's gonna rain.
there is hope in raindrops.
isn't that what you said?
what does that even mean?
it means...
that every drop of rain holds the promise of regrowth.
each has a purpose.
even if they don't know it.
I think we can feel that way.
that we don't have a purpose. But we do.
do you believe what you're saying?
about purpose?
you said you know how I feel.
you said you know pain.
and you wanted to kill yourself too, you said that.
Yes. -So?
what's your reason to stick around?
my reason? - Have you found your purpose?
it's okay. You did your best.
I don't believe in hope anymore.
all I know is we're all gonna die.
okay, here are the reentry files.
you need anything else?
uh, a computer with access to social service and medical databases would be useful.
now the host needs to be biological, able to cognate, but without its own governing consciousness.
a human brain would be ideal, but not a prerequisite.
what?
Peter, your father wouldn't want to hear me say this, but even if he does find out more about this machine, it doesn't necessarily mean he'll be able to prevent the events depicted in that picture.
I mean, that just could simply be your fate.
thankfully, I don't believe in fate.
whatever Walternate's plans are for me, I promise you, I'm not getting in that machine.
well, son, it isn't always that simple.
I've lived a long time, Peter.
so believe me when I tell you that sometimes when one walks away from his fate, it leads one directly to fate's doorstep.
Hey, Broyles just sent something over that you need to see.
excellent.
do it again, and I'll show you.
holy!
this video was taken last night just after 10: 00 in Roxbury.
nobody could have survived that impact.
and yet she did.
what are you thinking, Walter?
maybe it's not the woman at all.
maybe it's the location.
Walter, you think that this is spatial decay, don't you?
caused from a soft spot between the universes.
we're beginning to see signs of degradation on this side.
well, it was bound to happen.
I'm surprised that it's taken this long.
all right, we need a geiger counter.
no, no. We don't need anything.
we can handle this.
you need to... - What? Go to my room?
sit on my hands?
the computer is searching all the local hospitals
now I am not someone who can make that occur any faster.
fabulous.
fantastic.
agent Lee! You're gonna want to see this.
where is she? - Boston.
we have more advanced ways to detect molecular degeneration over there, but a simple radiation test should be enough to see whether the fabric of the universe has begun to decay.
And?
well, everything's within normal range.
nothing unusual here.
so if it's not the place, then it's got to be the girl.
must be something about her that allowed her to survive the fall.
well, then we need to get to know more about her.
DNA. Excellent.
I'll take the samples from the passenger's side.
look at this.
me and Belly collecting human tissue and fluid specimens.
just like when we were kids.
glad you guys are enjoying yourself.
this is Peter and Dr. Walter bishop, the civilian consultants I told you about.
this is special agent Lincoln Lee from Hartford.
he has some information regarding this case.
this is... - Agent Olivia Dunham.
fringe division.
what division?
so what you got?
the woman who jumped and walked away?
her name is Dana gray.
she was murdered 18 months ago.
two bullets in the head.
M. E.Said she died instantly.
she was killed with her husband and her children in a home invasion robbery.
that's grisly.
I can't argue.
this was a tough one.
they ever find who did it?
Yes. We tried to bring him in, but he drew on us.
two agents ended up putting him down in a shootout.
so case closed.
that is, until I get a call about Mrs. gray's body disappearing from the morgue.
I assumed it was stolen.
it's a reasonable assumption.
I didn't think anything of it until I saw this.
witnesses reported seeing two people jump out of a dorm window.
cops get there.
one body.
grad student who lived there.
but the cops find two sets of fingerprints on the ledge during their investigation.
second set, those fingerprints were identified as Dana gray's.
which is insane because she's dead.
well, you know, stranger things have happened.
um, no, they haven't.
don't listen to him...Her...Sorry...Go on.
not knowing what to make of it, I flag gray in the system.
over the next two months, we found prints at three other double suicides.
now security photos show her there, and eyewitnesses report seeing her die.
first responders show up, there's only one body, and it's never hers.
I know this sounds insane, but I don't think this woman can die.
isn't this our lucky day?
Hello?
hello.
what's he doing here?
I... - Belly invited him.
that's gene.
come down here.
I've got something.
um, what is this place exactly?
this is the place where the mysteries of the universe get answered.
and congratulations. Whatever your security clearance was, it just got about seven levels deeper.
something to show you.
we found two sets of DNA in the specimens we took from the scene.
two different people.
but in performing the tests, we noticed something odd in the molecules of Ms. gray's body.
they didn't want to come apart.
they were held together by an unusually strong electromagnetic bond.
um, I'm confused.
you're saying that her body's being held together by magnetism?
well, we're all held together by magnetism.
our molecules are like these hematite rocks.
magnetism is what keeps us from flying apart.
it's what keeps us solid.
in Ms. gray's case, the attraction was almost unbreakable.
it's a miracle she left any blood behind at all.
I think it suits you, dear.
um, but... but how?
I mean, why did she get magnetically supercharged?
belly, what if she took the energy from her victims?
victims? - The people she's jumping with.
Yeah, that'd make sense.
she absconds with their life force at the moment of death.
life force?
you mean like a soul?
is that even a scientific concept?
you know, it's best to try not to be reductive.
I mean, after all, every living thing is simply bundled energy.
and perhaps Ms. gray has found a way to capture some vital portion of another person's essential energy and therefore has extended her own life.
extending her own life.
a soul vampire.
as it were.
it says in the file that each one of the victims tried to commit suicide previously.
perhaps simple compassion, Belly.
Yes, that's brilliant.
she only wants to take the souls of those people that are already prepared to surrender their own.
a compassionate soul vampire.
Yes.
Oh, boy. Um, who are you guys?
why don't I explain that to you as we go?
are we going somewhere?
if you were looking for victims who had previously tried to commit suicide, where would you go?
suicide hotlines, therapy groups?
exactly.
Walter, give me a call if you can figure out any more about why Dana gray can't die.
helpline. This is Joan.
Hello?
I think I'm gonna hurt myself.
okay, sweetie, what's your name?
I'm Brian. - Hi, Brian.
I guess you're in a bad place right now, huh?
I'm tired.
I know, sweetie. Life can be tiring.
I know.
listen, Brian, I really want to help you, but you have to let me do that, okay?
and this is too important to do over the phone.
you're just trying to trick me.
you're gonna send the police to stop me.
no, listen to me, Brian. I would never do that. I promise, okay?
now, sweetheart, just tell me where you are.
that's her. Yeah, that's Joan.
is she working today?
no, she hasn't been in for a few days.
is she in some kind of trouble?
was she close with anybody in the office?
well, she was friendly, but I wouldn't say she was close to anyone.
she did her job and went home.
here's her desk.
I hope nothing's happened to her.
she's one of our best counselors.
how so?
well, if there was a particularly challenging call, a person who was at risk, we'd forward it to her.
she was amazing.
in three months, she saved at least 37 lives.
she had an uncanny way of connecting with people feeling hopelessness.
I mean, anybody who gets struck by lightning twice and survived has to have a perspective on hope, right?
do you have her address?
Yeah. Let me go get it.
if Dana gray is stealing people's souls as they die...
then why is she so committed to saving their lives?
Hello, Brian.
you're not scared.
I know when people are scared. And you're not.
Why? - Why are you doing this?
you think you convinced me to allow you to come here.
but it was me who wanted you to come.
okay.
I don't want to hurt people. But I always do.
who do you hurt?
I have no hope.
like those raindrops that you mentioned on the phone.
you said they have a purpose.
well, I don't like my purpose.
do you think the raindrops will help those people on the train?
what people on the train?
I don't want to hurt them. But I will.
and that's why you're here. You have to save them.
there's a duffel bag with my bomb.
and that's why you're here.
east bay railway train 67. Car 2. Seat 17.
like Azrael, let his angels carry my damned soul to heaven.
911. What is your emergency?
Hello? Hello?
no. Nothing. None of them fit the parameters.
here either.
we're looking for such specific conditions to accommodate your transfer, William.
a brain-dead patient like this could be one in a million.
no. No.
there's not much in here. No friends, no acquaintances.
no one that can tell us where to find her.
you?- Mm-mm.
just a bunch of books and a receipt from a flower shop for a dozen roses, but she paid in cash.
one of these things is not like the others.
what's that?
you never watched sesame street?
the afterlife of the soul.
these other books are clinical.
but this one's religious. - Exactly.
all the highlighted passages are about what happens to us after we die.
what's she doing, trying to convince people to jump by telling them how great heaven would be?
what if we're thinking about this backwards?
what if that book's not for other people? It's for her.
maybe she's the one that wants to die.
even if we were able to transfer your consciousness safely inside gene, there are other matters to consider.
well, we would communicate through my brainwaves.
you would hook me up to an eeg machine and decipher my thoughts.
that may work, but still...I'd have to milk you.
well, we could assign Astrid.
Oh, not now, son. We're on to something.
look, if Dana gray was hit by lightning twice, do you think that would help to explain why she's so overly electromagnetic?
I suppose that's possible.
the ions due to the multiple lightning strikes could cause her molecules to be supercharged.
and possibly intensified the electromagnetism.
why do you ask?
we don't think that she's trying to live forever. We think she's trying to die.
Dana gray's description just went out over the police bulletin in Dorchester.
somebody spotted her.
you're sure this is the woman you saw leaving the apartment?
like I already told the police, I was making dinner when I heard the gunshot.
I came out into the hall, and I saw that woman leaving.
did she kill him?
this is an ongoing investigation. I'm afraid I can't comment.
Oh, I see. You're the only one who gets to ask questions?
thank you for your cooperation.
so m. E.Says that the angle and wound powder burns are consistent with suicide, but the gun only discharged once.
it only takes one bullet to blow your brains out.
Yeah, sure, but up until now, her m. O.Has been to try and kill herself either with or directly after the suicide victim. Why?
if she can't die and her soul, energy, whatever you want to call it is bound to her body, maybe she's trying to go with theirs. Like a hitchhiker.
a stowaway to heaven? - Yeah.
Yeah, but she was here.
and Dana gray, why didn't she just pick up the gun and try to shoot herself?
try to catch a ride?
what changed?
I think this is the story you were looking for.
I'm surprised you've heard of it.
I'm taking a night class, and we're doing an essay on the journey of the soul to the afterlife.
then you'll find this very interesting.
the ascension of Azrael.
it's about a sinner named Azrael whose soul was condemned to purgatory.
after years of watching him suffer, the angels asked God to let Azrael free.
but God ignored them.
so the angels went down into purgatory and lifted Azrael up to heaven.
when God asked why they did this, the angels said Azrael had suffered enough.
and the combined innocence of the angels' souls outweighed Azrael's sins.
finally, God agreed.
and Azrael's soul was welcomed into heaven.
good luck with your assignment.
east bay railway train 67. Car 2. Seat 17.
Hello, freak show.
it's some kind of shrine.
more like a trophy room.
so clearly this guy was nuts.
I believe the clinical term is sociopath.
but yeah. He was.
so why was Dana gray here?
agent Broyles?
we found this invoice in the bathroom.
20 pounds of plastic explosives.
this guy was making a bomb.
so where is it?
okay. I'll pick them up on the way.
Yeah, I said okay.
all right. See you soon.
my sister. She had another baby.
her and her husband, they're like rabbits.
I'm heading to Providence to see 'em.
what about you? Where are you headed?
I'm on my way to see family too.
alert BPD and put the bomb squad on standby. Let me know when it's done.
Hey, Broyles, timers.
and the wires are stripped. Looks like he was getting ready to attach it to a power source.
he's rigged the bomb with a time detonator.
we went over every inch of this place. It's not here.
check his credit cards, atm withdrawals, Metro cards.
I want a list of possible targets, any places guy'd want to blow up.
Yes, sir.
what if you're tracking the wrong person? Dana gray was here.
you think she took the bomb?
why would she do that? - No. She didn't take it.
I think I know what's going on here.
it sounds insane, but here's my theory.
she can't die. But she wants to.
and she's been trying anything and everything she can to move on. Right?
she's been trying to stow away on the souls of the recently dead.
which is why she's been using suicide victims.
and how is that related to the plastic explosives about to be detonated somewhere in the city?
cause her plan isn't working.
she's looking for another way.
see, Dana was here when this guy committed suicide.
I think that he told her where the bomb is, and the only reason she didn't pick up that gun and follow suit is because she's gonna try something new.
so you think she's trying to increase her chances of making it to the afterlife by killing herself with a group of people?
it would explain why she's not here.
this woman lost her entire family.
she's desperate.
even if you're right, that still leaves the same problem. How do we find the bomb?
Hey, is this the suicide's phone?
placed a phone call half an hour before he shot himself.
Boston area code. How much you want to bet that's Dana gray's phone number?
you've reached the crisis helpline. This is Joan.
if this is an emergency, hang up and di...
she's not answering.
can't run a trace unless the line's open. She has to pick up.
can you change the outgoing caller I. D.On this phone from here? - Yeah, sure.
what are you thinking?
she may not answer this number, but I know whose number she will answer.
Hello? - Dana, please don't hang up.
who is this? - My name is Peter bishop.
the number that you're calling from, how did you get it?
I work with the FBI, Dana.
I'm sorry, Mr. bishop, but we have nothing to talk about.
Dana, please, I know what happened to you.
I know about your family. I know how they died.
and I know that you're only doing this because you want to be reunited with them.
just because you've read some files about me, Mr. bishop, doesn't mean you know the hell that I've been stuck in or what I have to do to make it stop.
but I can help you to make it stop.
the people that I work with are scientists. They are the best at what they do.
and if you come in, i promise you they can help you.
can you promise me you'll reunite me with my family?
can you promise me that killing a bunch of people will?
it's the best chance I've got.
I'm sorry. I have no choice.
Dana, that's not true. You have a choice. We all have a choice.
not me.
I should have died that night with my family.
but for some reason, some impossible cosmic joke, I'm stuck here.
I didn't ask for this.
as strange as this sounds, I know exactly what you're going through.
but believe me, Dana, this is not the solution.
I guess we'll find out soon enough.
did you get it?
I should have died that night with my family.
there. That in the background. Can you isolate that?
next stop, Norwood station.
here it is. I've got it open.
there are three different trains from three different points of origin that stop in Norwood at this time of night.
you sure? - Yeah, the 6: 15, the 6: 25, and the 6: 45.
she could be on any one of them.
ask him when they spoke to her. What time?
Hey, when did you speak to her? What time?
I don't know. It was ten minutes ago.
ten minutes ago.
Oh, good. I love word problems.
three trains all passing through Norwood.
each travelling at its own constant velocity.
not accounting for station stops.
what are they saying in the background?
I have no idea. They're doing that thing again where they don't finish sentences.
I merely need to insert the parameters based on the train schedule.
that is too early.
she's on the 6: 25. - She's on the 6: 25.
she's on the 6: 25.
excuse me. Can you keep an eye on my stuff here?
I have to use the bathroom.
we need to clear the train. There may be an explosive on board.
we think it's due to go off in about eight minutes.
this is the suspect.
there are over 300 people on this train.
that girl's in the next car.
she was right there.
bring the dogs in now.
I need everyone to stay calm.
I need a single file line. Move toward the nearest exit.
leave your belongings where they are. You can get them later.
I don't understand.
she's gone.
Hey! I've got something. Just down here.
she's dead.
so what changed?
after all that time trying, why is she able to die now?
welcome to the fringe division.
every answer you get just leads you to more questions.
that may be.
but it's a lot more exciting than Hartford.
feel free to give me a call if you ever find yourself needing some help.
be careful what you wish for.
Hello, Peter.
Walter thought that it would be a good idea for me to stay here tonight.
I just made a pot of tea.
would you like a cup? - Yeah. Why not?
so I've been thinking about Dana gray.
you're not the only one.
well, I have two thoughts.
my first thought is that the energy emitted from that bomb somehow reset the electromagnetic charge in her body and that it was that unique charge that enabled her to die permanently.
okay. That makes sense.
what was your second thought?
that my first thought is wrong.
And?
what if, Peter, this isn't about biology or physics?
what if what we witnessed was the very reason that Dana gray couldn't die?
Why?
because she needed to be here to save those people's lives.
you think it was her destiny.
well, destiny, fate.
Jung called it synchronicity, the interconnectedness of apparently unrelated events.
I mean, don't you think that it's curious we meet a woman who is unable to die at the exact moment my consciousness seemingly returns from the grave.
now as a scientist, I like to believe that nothing just happens, that every event has some meaning.
some sort of message.
you just have to be able to listen closely enough to hear it.
see.
it's a church bell.
so tell me, what's the meaning?
you okay, Bell?
Peter... - Olivia, is that you?
Oh, no. - What the hell just happened right there?
I think that I may have been wrong.
this may be a little more complicated than I first thought.
the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign.
please make sure your seatbelts are securely fastened.
I don't speak german. I'm from Denver. I'm from Denver.
my friend, it's just an electrical storm.
I understand.
here. Gum?
no, uh, thank you.
Oh, my god. - What?
this bed is loud. - You think?
we-- we can't keep doing this.
sneaking around.
department's not a massive fan of office romance.
the policy seminar was endless, wasn't it?
I kept finding myself staring at you.
actually had to move my chair to stop.
well, I-- I think charlie knows. - No, he doesn't know.
well, I think he does.
if he knew, you would be transferred.
the idea of somebody making a call whether or not you and I get to live in the same city, that's unacceptable to me.
anyway, that's all just preamble to the kicker, which is that...
I love you.
Yes, sir.
of course, sir.
Yes, sir, I'm on my way.
incident at Logan. International flight. Charlie's on his way.
agent Scott.
Logan AIRPORT BOSTON
we're gonna let the FBI take the lead.
Olivia dunham, FBI.
we got a flight out of Hamburg. 147 passengers.
towers lost contact three hours in.
they thought it might have been electrical interference.
they entered our airspace radio silent.
navy then scrambles two F-18s for escort.
they reported stains on the windows.
no signs of life aboard the jet.
white House approved a CDC request for the jet not to be opened until they arrive.
no signs of life? Who was flying the plane?
Logan's one of the first airports with the pearl autopilot system.
plane landed itself right on time.
unlike every flight I've ever taken.
well, let me assure you we'd be happy to treat you asamily too.
good old ntsb. They all like to think they're cops.
agent Scott. - Agent Francis. Agent Dunham.
whatever the hell Mcneary saw through that window, it made him throw up in front of his whole unit.
excuse me.
so what's going on here? Some sort of accident?
tarmac's closed.
nothing you need to worry about, sir.
Oh, all right.
move along. - I'll do that.
Thanks.
although this is a joint task force, you're all reporting to the Department of Homeland Security.
I'm special agent in charge Broyles.
D.C.Has sent me here to make sure we get results.
standard level four hazmat suits are required to go in.
members from each agency on the starting line as follows.
CIA, Baronoff.
FBI. Charlie Francis and John Scott.
everyone else stand by.
okay, people, let's move.
sir!
Olivia Dunham, FBI interagency liaison.
liaison on an interagency task force. Gotta love that.
kind of like powdered sugar on a glazed donut.
excuse me, if I'm gonna do my job effectively, I like my information first-hand.
that's not redundancy. That's accountability.
I know exactly who you are.
you want in, liaison?
suit up.
what kind of terrorism is this?
who says it's terrorism?
sources tell us the plane was deliberately set ablaze by the CDC after all passengers' remains had been removed...
federal BUILDING BOSTON seat 41a, John Rosenbloom. Honolulu, Hawaii. Car salesman.
criminal history's negative.
have we reviewed video from the Hamburg airport?
we need to see if any passengers...
on its way.
and what the hell is taking so long with that black box?
please tell me that terminal's shutdown.
it's been down since 0400 local. You got any more questions?
who's point from CDC on the bone tissue...
agent Paley. You want his home number?
no, but I'd like the whole report.
and not just this fax-- - We're on that too liaison.
we don't think what happened on that plane was a result of the in-flight movie.
back bay pd got a call at 0300 from a guard on duty at a storage facility.
he saw two, and I quote, "suspicious middle eastern men" handing a white guy a briefcase.
liaison, take it. Go find out.
take what? That?
you're telling me that's my assignment?
Yeah, honey. Would you mind?
in conjunction with the center for disease control, the decision was made to burn the plane only after it was determined
petty bastard.
he's pissed because his best friend sexually assaulted three marine privates, and I'm the bad guy 'cause I put him away.
Broyles is an idiot.
you're smarter, you're stronger, you're much better looking.
he's jealous.
what?
you said you loved me in the motel.
Yeah.
that was a big deal.
Yeah, well, you didn't say anything back, so I just let it go.
I've been sort of bad at this for a long time.
until you.
I wanted to say I love you too.
let's go check the trash together.
empty.
acetylene, propane?
no, ammonia.
what are you doing?
what are you doing? I'm a federal agent.
we need to get a chem transport team out here now.
I'm on it.
no signal.
Freeze! FBI!
I have a gun! I will shoot!
we got a runner in the back. We need him alive.
I'm on my way.
hands in the air! - John!
you were very lucky today, agent Dunham.
your wounds could've easily been much more severe.
agent Scott wasn't as fortunate.
while he survived the initial blast, agent scott was exposed to some synthetic chemical compounds.
work that was done in the labs you found.
he's not contagious, but until we understand more, it's better not to introduce any additional contaminants.
we haven't been able to identify the substance that's affecting him.
the CDC has sent in specialists, but...
well, they've never seen anything like what's happening here.
we've put agent scott in a drug-induced coma.
his body temperature has been lowered significantly to try and slow the progress.
I'm sorry, agent Dunham.
it's me.
liaison.
I found a connection between the Hamburg flight and what's happened to agent Scott.
his name's Walter Bishop.
he's a scientific researcher from Cambridge.
born in '46, harvard educated.
post grad at Oxford and M.I.T.
look at the experiments he was doing in the '70s.
I believe Dr. Bishop might have information that might tell us what happened aboard that plane and save agent Scott's life.
says the guy's been at St. Claire's for 17 years.
I saw that. An assistant was killed in his lab.
rumors about Dr. Bishop using humans as guinea pigs.
he was charged with manslaughter, but was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial.
why are you so sure Bishop's worth our time?
why are you so sure he's not?
listen, Dunham, you and I got off on the wrong foot
if my past job performance as U. S. Marine special investigator offends you
well, yeah, it does.
a man who serves his country for 30 years has a few drinks and a small lapse in judgment - does not deserve five years. - A small lapse in judgment that will haunt three young women for the rest of their lives.
but that's not tonight's business, is it?
look, D.C. Has tasked me to make sure that our reaction to flight 627 is beyond reproach.
now it says here, in 1991 the glorious state of massachusetts forbade dr. Bishop from having any visitors with the exception of immediate family.
so from where I sit, barging into a mental institution waving the patriot act, which is what you'd need, and demanding face time with some old lab rat who you think might be behind some of the most terrifying terror that I can possibly imagine
I'm coming to you with a solid lead, - and your personal resentment is preventing you-- - and you're wasting your breath and my time.
do you understand "immediate family?
you want to question dr. Bishop, you go find his next of kin and have 'em escort you in.
talk to bishop, uncover something substantial, and I will have your back.
until then, I am not so convinced.
now can you handle that?
he does have a son.
is his son local too?
not exactly.
BAGHADAD IRAQ so this guy's walter bishop's son.
his name's peter bishop.
he's a high school dropout, I.Q. At 190, which is 50 points north of genius.
misfit, nomad.
hasn't kept a job longer than two months.
he's been a wild land fireman, cargo pilot, and briefly a college chemistry professor.
he falsified a degree from M.I.T.
and even managed to get a few papers published before he was found out.
sounds like a massive pain in the ass.
my resume is hardly traditional.
but around these parts, traditional increasingly means irrelevant.
$100 billion sunk into infrastructure and you can barely keep the lights on.
so you need someone to oversee construction on 600 miles of pipeline to carry crude between your fields in kirkuk and the port of ceyhan.
a job well outside the green zone, I might add while I'm still alive to do so.
you'll need someone who has a handle on the laws of hydrodynamic resistance.
the heat exchange in oil mixture flows.
you'll also need someone who can work with mixed integer programs because you're gonna have to resize the pipes as you start working across uneven terrain.
that is, if you want to keep down construction costs.
I also speak Farsi.
and 600, 000 all in sounds fair.
Olivia Dunham. I'm with the FBI.
okay.
you've heard of flight 627?
the Hamburg flight, of course.
you may be able to help us with that.
no, I think you got the wrong guy.
your father is Walter Bishop.
you know, the last time somebody asked me that it was an accusation.
well, he's the man we're looking to speak with, but due to his current status, you're the only one who can provide us access.
and what possible help could that man be to you?
and what is it exactly that you're expecting me to do?
hop on a plane with you back to Massachusetts?
I just got here, honey.
I can have you on a return flight here in four days, but first
let me save you the time.
I'd rather stay here in Iraq.
that's how much I want to see my father.
I'm going to beg you as one human being to another.
your father may be able to save someone who's dying.
someone I care about very much.
sweetheart, we all care about someone who's dying.
I can't help you. I'm sorry.
I know why you're here!
I have your file.
what file?
the one the fbi would say doesn't exist.
and it has everything.
where you've been, what you're running from.
and what you need while you're here.
so either you come with me, or I let certain people know your whereabouts.
when do we leave?
did the doctors say anything else?
Yeah.
Thanks, Charlie.
let me ask you something.
my father, not my favorite.
he is without a doubt the most self-absorbed, twisted, abusive, brilliant, myopic son of a bitch on the planet.
so he was a chemist.
that much I already know.
he worked out of a basement lab in harvard doing research for a toothpaste company.
I also know that there was an accident at the lab one night, that my father was arrested, beginning the first truly peaceful period in our home.
but here's the thing, olivia.
my gut tells me that your friend's life, the one hanging in the balance, not gonna be saved by a tube of toothpaste.
he worked out of harvard, but not on toothpaste.
he was part of a classified U. S.Army experimental program called kelvin genetics.
they gave him the resources to do whatever work he wanted, which was primarily in an area called fringe science.
when you say fringe science, you mean pseudoscience.
I suppose.
things like mind control, teleportation, astral projection, invisibility, genetic mutation, reanimation, fertility
whoa, excuse for a sec.
Reanimation? Really?
so you're telling me what?
my father was dr. Frankenstein?
ESSEXCOUNTY MASSACHUSETTS
you know what?
why don't you go on ahead.
Dr. Bishop, special day. You have a visitor.
hello.
I knew someone would come... eventually.
Dr. Bishop.
Dr. Bishop?
and you said this was-- when did this happen?
the incident on the plane happened four days ago.
agent Scott was injured the next day.
the dermis already indurated, translucent.
M-muscular tissue visible.
on scott, you mean, can you see through skin?
Yes.
Oh, that's not good.
to see through the skin, it's--it's tricky, it's advanced.
like that it's tricky. - What's happening to him?
can it be reversed?
what is it?
they... they have this horrible...
pudding here.
butterscotch pudding on mondays. It's dreadful.
it's thursday.
Oh, that's fantastic news.
it can be reversed.
what happened to your colleague.
years ago I worked with lab animals, and-- and ...
some of them were afflicted, but were saved.
so do you remember what to do?
this place, their- their choice of therapies has c--c
Dr. Bishop.
you came here today with my son.
I'm not allowed visitors, you see, except immediate family.
and unless the order has been lifted, then it's a simple if/then formula.
if you are here, then so is he.
I would... so much...
so very much like to see him.
so much.
he asked for you.
Thanks, sweetheart.
I really appreciate that.
Hey, I didn't tell him you were here.
and call me "sweetheart" one more time. I'd really like that.
Hello, walter.
I thought you'd be fatter.
you thought I would be fatter.
excellent first words, perfect.
no, as a boy, you were rounder.
Yes, I was until the summer before high school.
not that I'd expect you to remember that.
may I see something?
what are you doing? Take your hands off of me!
pupils are good. They're good. Thank goodness.
how advanced is your colleague's condition?
Which-- which is something I- I- I
I'm unable to deduce without a firsthand examination.
I must see mr. Scott myself.
which I am unable to do.
well, under present law.
Unless--unless signed out by a legal guardian who must be, once again, a relative.
what are you asking me to
no. Guardian? No, forget it.
he'll do it. - No, I will not.
one phone call. That's all it takes. You want me to make it?
cause I got my phone in my pocket.
now it's out of my pocket.
you wanted my father.
now you've got my father.
which falls into the category of be careful what you wish for...
sweetheart.
every effort is being made to understand what happened on flight 627...
Dr. Bishop, I was curious.
did anyone else ever have access to your work?
well, the assistants had bits and pieces.
and god, I suppose.
I supposed the only one that really knew what I was doing was belly.
who?
belly, William Bell. He and I shared the lab.
you shared your lab with the founder of massive dynamics?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that is, massive dynamics.
Oh, nothing really. Just a tiny little company.
that's perfect.
one guys becomes one of the wealthiest men on the planet.
the other guy becomes an institutionalized psychopath.
what? What happened?
I just pissed myself.
excellent. - Just a squirt.
I just got your message. How's John?
worse.
cdc says the hamburg flight was caused by a synthetic compound.
which is like saying rain is caused by a wet compound.
they've run some tests on john, but haven't come back with anything.
what about Bishop?
left to right, insane and irritating.
and also my only hope.
listen...
I need to question William Bell.
could you set that up for me?
massive dynamics William Bell.
he and bishop used to share a lab.
you're kidding.
Dr. Bishop?
is there ginger ale? Any ginger ale?
I haven't had some in a long time. I miss it.
can we please get some ginger ale for the doctor, agent Farnsworth.
sure.
whoa, stop right now! Stop!
does this not concern you?
let him go.
petri dish.
quick, please.
good.
I need to take this to my lab right away. - Your what?
kresge building basement, Harvard.
we should leave.
I have my sample.
your lab was shutdown after you left.
I'm sorry?
wake up. It's gone.
no.
no, no, no.
no, no, no, no, no, no.
Walter, there is no lab.
it's a perfect working-- - no!
damn you, damn you!
we need to get him back immediately.
liaison.
when did you get back? - I need your help.
I want you to know I've successfully had dr. Walter bishop released from st. Claire's, and he requires the use of his old laboratory.
I'm sorry, what?
kresge building. Harvard, basement.
the university's been using it for storage for the past 17 years.
it would be nice to think that your tenacity in this case is a byproduct of a remarkable and robust professionalism.
but I can't help but wonder if there wasn't something going on between you and agent scott.
get the lab for Bishop.
so much.
so much happened here.
and so much is about to.
harvard UNIVERSITY
Dr. Bishop, I've ordered a standard forensics work package.
is there anything else you need?
um, optical coherence tomograph for flesh study.
2, 000 pounds of silicon.
at least five anonymous blood samples from volunteer donors.
microorganism detector.
nasa grade, of course. There's still nasa, yes?
Yes.
Oh, she's still here!
Oh, this tank was the best.
and a two-year-old bos taurus.
a what?
a cow.
he wants a cow.
purebred, not crossbred. This is important.
mature weight, 850 pounds.
internal fat average of 2. 37
is he joking?
genetically, humans and cows are separated by only a couple lines of dna.
so it's an ethical test subject.
Where'd you learn that? M.I.T?
no, actually.
I picked that up reading books.
you should try it sometime. It's fun.
get him the cow.
fantastic, thank you.
the only thing better than a cow is a human.
unless you need milk. Then you really need a cow.
coffee?
Thanks.
tell me.
what else did that file say about yours truly? How bad was it?
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
why don't you go ahead and liberate yourself,'cause I'm here now, so I kind of feel like I deserve the truth, don't you?
there was no file.
I needed you back here.
so that was what? You were bluffing?
I- I was desperate.
you know, I'm usually pretty good at reading people.
that's sort of what I do.
Yeah, well, I could see you were in trouble. Anyone could see that.
so I could've stayed.
I could've stayed in iraq.
you know, a car bomb went off this morning in kirkuk.
you might just owe me a thank you.
Yeah, well, I owe a lot.
tsk, yeah, I figured. MafiA.
a guy named big Eddie.
you owe money to a guy nicknamed big Eddie?
no, I owe money to a guy named big Eddie.
he had it legally changed.
and the thing is, I'm not even a gambler. I mean, I never was.
it just-- a couple years ago I went a bit crazy.
I thought you were a genius. You must've had a system.
of course there was a system.
the house was cheating.
but you try telling 'em that.
72 during Vietnam.
the D.O.D.'S biochem division had us working on a leprotic contagion for possible use against the vietcong.
it's possible that whatever affected that plane may have been derived from that work.
what about John?
what's infecting him is merely a chemical reaction to the raw laboratory ingredients, not the finished contagion.
which means we can synthesize a counteragent.
so you can help him. - Don't do that.
don't give her false hope.
there's no false. It's not false. It's real.
I could help, yes.
if I had a precise inventory of what was in that storage facility when it detonated.
we don't have it.
it all went up, everything.
and the suspect who might have those answers got away, and John was the only one who saw his face.
so how long does he have left?
current rate of crystallization, cellular degradation
how long? - 24 hours.
his brain will no longer be able to oxygenate itself.
I'm so sorry...
that I can't offer you a less dangerous solution.
what do you mean?
didn't I mention it?
whatever you think you said, you didn't say.
the synaptic transfer system.
the shared dream state.
what do you mean shared dream state?
the human brain generates a quantifiable electric field.
I posited in 1976 that it is possible to synchronize the fields of two distinct minds to allow the sharing of information across the unconscious state.
like a string between two tin cans.
you know what's great about that?
is that it's completely insane.
you're saying I can talk to john in a coma and he can tell me what the suspect looks like.
it's not an exact science. - It's not even science.
have you done this before?
I have used this technique to extract information from a corpse once.
you can do that if they haven't been dead for longer than six hours.
right, 'cause after six hours, that's when they're really dead.
you could access his memories.
assuming there's no brain damage.
of course you'd have to have an electromagnetic probe placed in the base of your skull whilst immersed without clothing in the old tank.
and you'd be heavily drugged.
what sort of drugs?
Oh, a mix of ketamine, neurontin, lysergic acid diethylamide.
that last one is lsd, by the way-- acid.
take at least a few hours.
I'd need your help to synthesize it if it's not too much trouble.
Yeah, sure, no problem. That sounds like fun.
the man who was just released from the mental institution, he wants to give you a drug overdose, then sick a metal rod into your head and put you naked into a rusty tank of water.
no, I don't want to.
no, I'd rather not. I'm just saying I can.
okay, Olivia, excuse me for sec.
now you're obviously under severe duress, and you haven't slept since iraq, and the man you care about might die, but I'm telling you that man will kill you.
you don't understand the procedure.
John would do it for me.
set it up.
I'll get dhs authorization to bring John here.
this is unbelievable. This is insane! He is insane!
and you're insane for following him.
excellent.
let's make some lsd.
put him over here.
Salt'll make you float.
Charlie, did you get me in to see William Bell?
massive dynamics isn't exactly being forthcoming or courteous.
and apparently, William Bell is out of the country for the next two weeks.
what's this?
a sweet little memo from their general counsel.
so Bell doesn't want to talk?
or he's just being the head of a $50 billion corporation.
Oh, screw this.
I want to drive a tank through William Bell's office and find out what he knows.
I know you do, but I'm here to tell you the bad news.
it's gonna be another 48 hours till we get a court order.
you should probably strip to your underwear.
hello.
what the hell was that?
Charlie, we don't have 48 hours.
I need you to get to Bell.
if walter fails, Bell could be the only one to save us.
Livvy, what's happening here?
you've cleared all this with Broyles?
somewhat.
somewhat doesn't sound good.
is that a cow?
Yeah, that's Gene.
listen, charlie, I- I need you to promise me you'll do whatever you can.
of course. You know that.
be careful.
my god.
now where was I?
could you tilt your head forward, please.
I still think that this is deeply irresponsible, and believe me, I would know.
this is an anesthetic.
I feel normal working.
Yeah, 'cause bootlegging smack in the basement is just the picture of normalcy.
I got you. I got you.
I hope your guy is worth it.
and this...
will rip open your consciousness.
listen, in case, you don't come back, I just...
wanted to say before we do this, how much I appreciate what you've done.
there are so many things you'll lose in a place like that.
you lose being trusted.
strange how important that is once it's gone.
if you want to watch, you can come closer.
do you work here?
Yeah, I'm Astrid Farnsworth, assistant to agent Dunham.
who?
Oh, yes. I'm walter...
Yes, thank you.
don't mention it.
these are her brain rhythms.
more important than most people know regarding cerebral regional interaction.
critical.
and-- and these are his.
as the drugs take effect, the probes will synchronize the electrical signals from both.
that's what the brain is, an electrical router.
should be able to be interpreted by the other.
Yeah, simple really. Like making taffy.
then when the rhythms are in synch, they should be in the same place, so to speak.
so what do we do now?
now we wait.
what was that?
hello. Hello!
I think I'm here. I think I'm here. I'm here.
that's my uncle's kayak.
John? Is that you?
what's happening? - She's fine.
she's all right? - She's fine.
you sure? - Look.
I was just thinking about you.
what was that?
Oh, nothing.
John... you were hurt.
I don't remember.
think.
the storage units.
I feel cold.
I need you to remember.
remember what?
what you saw.
I need you to show me his face.
Why?
so I can save you.
please try.
try and remember.
Yes, this is right. This is right.
we got a runner in the back. We need him alive.
I can't see his face.
her leg!
Oh, I saw him!
I saw john get hurt. I was there. I was there, I saw--I saw him.
what do you mean you saw him? Where?
I told you not to ask me that.
this is him. This is the suspect we're looking for. He looks like this send me the image. I'll put it through the database.
have you slept? You look like crap.
no primary matches for criminal record.
well, cross-check all state driver license files and send this image to all local hospitals.
agent Dunham, take a look at this.
Oh, my god. This is him.
he was a passenger on flight 627.
I don't-- I don't understand. - Wait, wait, wait.
he couldn't have been at the storage place.
Charlie, I saw him there. - hold on, guys.
morgan steig was passenger number 108.
his emergency contact, richard steig.
you're telling me he has a twin?
Yeah, no home address, only a history of employment.
what?
richard steig's last employer.
I was hoping to speak with william bell.
massive DYNAMIC NEW YORK
I'm nina sharp, executive director.
I only have a few minutes.
our primary suspect is a former employee of yours, richard steig, who may have used research from your company to develop a self-eradicating airborne toxin.
we don't know why or for whom, but it appears he was willing to sacrifice his own brother.
whatever killed those people on that plane got onboard through his insulin pen.
so do you want to talk to me?
please assemble everything we have on richard steig for agent dunham here.
I remember richard steig.
he worked in our weapons systems research lab.
he was caught three months ago trying to leave the premises with classified information.
he was terminated immediately.
we referred his name to the justice department.
we have done our due diligence, agent dunham.
and if you choose to drag our company and dr. Bell's name into this matter, you will be hearing from our attorneys.
how long have you worked for dr. Bell?
16 years.
I owe massive dynamics my life, and that is not an exaggeratioN.
I s a runner most of my life.
in the '97 boston marathon, I felt strangely tired.
one day at the office, dr. Bell noticed my discomfort and insisted I go for a cat scan.
cancer.
spread so severely I had to have my arm amputated that week.
that first scanner that found my cancer was built by this company.
the robotic assist tools there were used in my surgery, the drugs I took afterwards...
were developed and manufactured by massive dynamics.
and my replacement limb was designed by bell himself.
everything we have on richard steig.
do you believe that steig may be part of the pattern?
I'm sorry, part of the...
part of the pattern?
Oh, I assumed you had clearance.
well, I'm cleared to know whatever you're cleared to know, Ms. Sharp.
apparently not.
but suffice to say that we've reached a point where science and technology have advanced at such an exponential rate for so long, it may be way beyond our ability to regulate and control them.
you should know what you're getting into, agent Dunham.
I would say this to my own daughter.
be careful.
and good luck.
keep the tree warm, Sandy! We're on our way to your house!
and this is a show for children?
Yeah, it's huge.
surprisingly profound for a narrative about a sponge.
crazy house.
I just landed at logan. I'm on my way to you.
I think we've located our suspect.
hold on a second. You found the guy?
you found the guy from your dream.
I'm picking you both up.
I need your father there to question him, get whatever information he needs so he can make the cure for john.
and I need you there too in case your father's
say no more. We'll meet you out front.
stay eyes on south side.
red, stand by.
rooftop, confirm your position.
s BOSTON
got one coming out.
this way, ma'am.
clear! Clear! Clear!
in the back!
I'd like to... check your blood pressure.
why don't you check your own blood pressure? Mine's fine, thanks.
your skin tone suggests you might be suffering from arterial hypertension.
don't tell me what I'm suffering from.
and there are no visible signs of hypertension.
when this over, please don't send me back.
I don't want to go back.
look, walter
this experience...You woke me up again, and...
you can't put me back to sleep.
it was hardly my idea, any of it.
whatever punishment you think I deserve,
I swear I have already endured it.
17 years. Please...
son.
what?
he's in the alley!
can I get out of the car?
stay right there, Walter!
we've got some questions for you.
U.S.Code 1111.
the murder of 147 passengers.
U.S.Code 2332-A.
use of weapons of mass destruction.
U.S.Code 2332-B.
an act of terrorism transcending national borders.
U.S.Code 1132-A.
attempted murder of a federal agent.
you want immunity.
I want a detailed account of all the synthetic chemicals you had in that storage facility.
write them down.
and then we can talk about an agreement.
I... have nothing... to say.
Walter, stay here.
where are you
the compound affecting agent scott.
it's water soluble, right?
we might not know what it is, but we know what it does.
so if I wanted to, I could extract the contagious fluids from his body and...
that would allow me to slip it to you whenever I wanted to.
in your food.
a cup of coffee.
the toilet.
nobody would ever know how it happened.
the only problem is...
the woman who was just in here, that's her friend who's dying.
so I just don't have that kind of time.
No!
tell me the chemicals!
Hey, stop, stop! You can't! You can't do that.
no, you can't do that.
I want the names of the chemicals.
I'm gonna count to one.
one!
the active toxin was a magnesium based ethylene glycol.
no, I understand that, but you're not listening to me.
magnesium ethylene glycol with an organophosphate trig
Walter, just stop for a second.
his blood won't be able to absorb it before the side-effects kill him.
so you're saying what?
we synthesize a calcium gluconate in a thiamine base?
Yes, exactly.
we can't. We'd need more of his blood. We have none.
that's not true
all agents are required to set up a backup blood supply in case we're wounded.
autologous transfusion. That's brilliant.
we can create the antidote and then just dissolve it into scott's stored blood.
if we transfuse him intravenously, his body won't be overwhelmed.
a+, boY. Well done. Let's begin.
so I got the lab.
Yeah, I know you did.
Thanks.
how's it goin' downstairs?
Bishop says it'll be awhile, but that it's looking auspicious.
that was his word.
what?
you've done some solid work here.
locating bishop. Getting him out. Finding a way to get him to work with you.
we're impressed.
who's "we"?
what happened on that plane might be part of something more dangerous than just simple terrorism.
simple terrorism?
in the past nine months, there have been three dozen authenticated incidents like the Hamburg flight.
John Thompson, normal kid, went missing back in '98.
reappeared last month halfway around the world. Hadn't aged a day.
in the past few months, 46 other children who went missing that same year turn up.
same story.
local fisherman off the coast of sri lanka reports a low-flying plane emitting a high-pitch frequency that blows out all their windows.
an hour later, same spot, an 8.7 sub-surface earthquake creates a tsunami that kills 83, 000 people.
so why are you telling me-- - this man.
a patient in lisbon who woke up after years in a coma began writing just numbers.
they turn out to be exact real-time coordinates of our carrier battle groups in the pacific.
intel that's classified above top-secret.
so how is that even possible?
come work for me, and I'll get you the clearance
Oh, stop.
Dunham, there's more you need to hear.
you must not have heard me. I said stop.
they're calling these events "the pattern.
as if someone out there is experimenting, only the whole world is their lab.
you've seen it, now you know.
I don't wanna know. I have a job.
this is a more important job.
anything, anybody you need, you can have.
I like the job I've got.
and the man I do it with. Which you seem to have deduced on your own.
look around.
you see all these people going about their lives.
no idea what's happening around them, what they're in the middle of.
I just wanna go back to before.
Dunham. I don't think you can.
he's up. He's awake.
Olivia, olivia, he's awake! He's conscious.
John, can you hear me, baby? Baby?
I had a dream about you.
uh, a change of clothes for agent Scott.
his vitals are surprisingly strong.
so, um, how long does he have to stay?
until the melanocytes in his skin have regenerated, but that shouldn't be more than a week.
he owes you his life.
we owe each other.
what room is steig in?
I told you everything I know. Didn't I?
I gave you the names of all the synthetics I used in the compound.
don't worry, our immunity agreement holds.
but there's still a whole lot more we have to talk about.
like, why you killed your own brother?
and who you're selling your work to?
who says I was selling it?
I was threatened by a guy from your office.
you think I'm lying?
I swear to god.
I can prove it.
Where's the recording? - I buried it.
who is this?
we had an exchange agreement.
hmm, there have been other bidders.
today, the airplane was a demonstration.
you've drawn unwarranted attention.
something we can't afford to be connected with.
I'll make this simple. You're not selling to anyone else.
you do that, we will come after you.
I will come after you.
you're threatening me after seeing what I'm willing to do to my own brother?
well, let me assure you, we'd be happy to treat you as family too.
well, let me assure you. We'd be happy to treat you as family too.
special agent scott.
Yes, sir, go right ahead.
Charlie, I need two agents posted outside agent Scott's room now.
check on Steig.
I'm on it.
I'm five minutes away.
we need this place locked down!
this is Dunham, agent I.D.52776 In pursuit of blue suv heading south on fenway.
need immediate assist.
ask yourself why...
why Broyles sent you to the storage facility.
why you?
Why? I don't understand.
who are you working for?
John, tell me.
tell me more, John.
I knew him just as long as you did.
I'm sorry.
job isn't what it was ten years ago.
we're supposed to protect a world where one breath of the wrong air can incinerate you from the inside out.
I mean, how do we protect people when corporations have higher security clearances than we do?
when we're not fully briefed on half the things that we're investigating?
you know, when the truth...
the truth is we're obsolete.
take me back to the lab.
can I talk to you please?
Yeah. I'll be back in a second.
though I'm sure you're anxious to get as far away from here as possible.
to Iraq or Afghanistan or countless other out of reach places, but I'm here to tell you that your father needs to stay.
which means that you need to too.
are you okay?
no, I- I- I- I know that you have countless reasons as to why this is a non-starter for you.
but, I mean, your father is a good man.
he's not the monster you think he is.
and you're good with him, despite what you think.
and you're the only one who speaks Walter.
we take him back to St. Claire's and it's all over.
Where's John?
I can talk to the agency and get them to clear your gambling debts.
I can take care of my own debts, okay? What just happened? Where's John?
I'm not gonna use false threats with you anymore.
I don't need to.
the threats are real.
after you left, my father sat down and started talking to me and he was remarkably lucid.
he told me about the work. That he and William bell had done their experiments.
and that incident-- what happened on the plane is just the beginning.
which makes every part of me feel like I gotta get the hell outta Boston.
are we leaving?
are we leaving?
how long has he been dead?
five hours.
question him.
Boston MASS what's her name?
whoever you're thinking about.
your girlfriend or whatever.
I don't have a girlfriend.
yeah?
what's in the bag?
Oh, is it a pizza?
cause I could really go for a mushroom pizza.
Yeah, it's a mushroom pizza.
awesome.
you're not married, are you?
not that it's any of my business.
well, you never know about people.
my name isn't amber, by the way, obviously.
that's just for the club.
you wanna know my real name or what?
Yes, I do. Very much.
ready for this?
loraine daisy.
all my sisters have flowers for middle names.
my mom couldn't even spell loraine right.
what is it? - I don't know!
what is it?
Oh, god, what's happening?
it'll be over in a second. Hold on.
try and get up. Try and get up. Try and get up.
everything okay? You need a lift to the hospital, I got a van right here.
Thanks, I'll take her. I'll take her.
what's happening to me?
help! Don't leave me!
I'm dr. Steel, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. Take a deep breath, all right?
you're gonna be fine. Take a deep breath. Now, how many months are you?
how many months what? - Pregnant.
I'm not--not pregnant!
hold her down. We're gonna have to strap her in.
nooo!
we gotta cut this baby out now, doctor! - All right, all right.
V. P.60, pulse is thready.
what the hell was that?
we lost her heartbeat.
go for the baby now. Give me a scalpel.
all right, come on.
Oh, god. - Dear god.
thank you all for convening at this late hour.
43 minutes ago, we were alerted to an incident at the wallace bromley medical center.
while the details are still coming in, it appears to be another anomaly whose mysteries and origins remains the sole purpose of this committee.
I called you together tonight to introduce you to my new team, who will now be responsible for investigating all these events.
hopefully, they will have more success than our last.
Walter bishop, dubbed by his contemporaries as a successor to albert einstein, worked for the defense advanced research projects agency from the late '70s...
until he was committed to the st. Clair's mental institution for manslaughter.
he was never convicted of that crime.
but in one of your own reports, you theorize that bishop's previous work may itself be the root of all these unexplained phenomenon.
given that he's been hugging a padded cell for 17 years,
I think we can probably exclude him as a suspect.
however, his knowledge makes him uniquely qualified to assist our efforts while he remains in the legal custody of his son peter.
Yes, peter bishop, whose history of questionable business practices verge on fraud.
yet you propose giving him access to information that, if made public, would cause mass panic.
there's nothing we could tell him that he can't learn from his father or deduce himself, with a 190 iq.
what were you thinking when you recruited olivia dunham?
an F. B.I. Agent who had an illicit affair with her partner, a man who turned out to be a traitor.
I was thinking that a woman who didn't hesitate to follow the evidence and expose the man she loved at the cost of great personal pain and embarrassment must surely be worthy of our trust.
I love you.
who--who are you working for?
Hello?
wake up--there's something you need to see.
well, waking up's not gonna be a problem, but thank you for the gentle nudge.
pick up the others and meet me in 30 minutes at the bromley medical center.
Ah, good morning to you too.
you're kiddin' me, right?
your phone was off the hook.
that's 'cause I didn't want to get woken up.
you need to get your father.
apparently there's something we need to see.
and this something-- - it can't wait.
okay. Walter.
Hey, Walter, come on, we're-- Walter?
come on.
tell me you're not in the closet.
what the hell are you doing here again?
where I've been for the past 17 years is a mental hospital.
St. Clair'S.
I'm the one that got you out of that place, remember?
there was a patient there. Carlos.
he would sing row, row, row your boat every night.
funny how difficult it is to sleep without that song.
that's nice.
we gotta go, Walter.
Hey, I got here as fast as we could.
27 minutes. Nicely done.
I'm Philip Broyles, department of homeland security.
thank for agreeing to work with us.
just to be clear, I haven't agreed to anything.
I'm just here as the babysitter.
my father is the one you want.
nice to meet you anyway.
is he coming out?
well, that's unclear.
he's currently in the car fiddling around with his seat warmer.
Dr. Bishop, hello.
I appreciate you coming out tonight.
I've never seen a feature like this before.
it warms your ass. It's wonderful.
have you tried it?
17 past midnight, a woman, pregnant to term, was found alone outside the hospital.
she collapsed, suffering severe abdominal pain.
she's a jane doe.
prints and DNA are being run now.
should have her id'd by sundown.
at 2: 24, less than two minutes after she was pronounced dead, ms. Doe became a mother.
did the baby survive?
the newborn was convulsing.
screaming in obvious pain.
they placed it in a bassinet, were in the process of transferring it to an intensive care when they realized what was happening.
it was growing... before their eyes.
growing? You mean they could... see it getting larger?
that's right.
so where's the baby now?
it remained alive for nearly half an hour, - this way.
finally dying from natural causes.
natural causes?
I don't understand.
what they realized is that the child wasn't just growing.
it was aging.
O-okay, hold on a sec. It's 4: 00 A. M.
so I'm a little foggy, but we're supposed to believe that grandpa here was born four hours ago?
were there any calls or tips?
did the security cameras see how the pregnant woman got here?
did she drive herself or was she dropped off?
we're checking those now.
Dr. Bishop, any idea how something like this might happen?
I think you're probably expecting a bit much, mr. Broyles.
Celermitosis. Disabling, reversing cell cycle inhibitors.
activating them and turning cip/kip and inka 4a/arfs into catalysts.
Ah, 92% of caucasian newborns have blue eyes.
yours were green.
to understand what happened here, I'll need to run extensive tests, get these bodies to a lab.
therefore, of course, I'll need a lab immediately.
doctor, you have one.
your old lab at Harvard. We reopened it for you.
do you not remember that?
no. No, but that's fantastic news!
all right, let's assume for a second that bundle of joy here is for real.
what are we doing here?
a series of events has occurred, continues to occur, that has us and other agencies on alert.
these events appear to be scientific in nature and suggest a larger strategy, a coordinated effort.
it's been referred to as "the pattern.
Mr. Boyles, I consider myself a fairly intelligent guy.
but I'm not following you here.
inexplicable and frightening things are happening and there's a connection somehow.
Thanks. That much, I understand.
I got henning on the phone.
the hospital got a call from a guest at the scarlet red motel, checking to see if the pregnant woman was doing okay.
was she staying there?
Yes, with a caucasian male-- 20s, brown hair.
but there's no description of him or the car he was driving.
call the motel--make sure they don't touch anything.
they shouldn't even go in.
I already called, and you're good to go.
the motel room's empty and locked.
Dr. Bishop?
I may need you to take samples from the motel room.
I need you to come with me.
do you see what I'm doing here?
relax.
I can't figure this out with a girl buzzing in my ear.
I am trying to put these pieces together like a puzzle.
how this happened, how he happened to her. I'm working.
come on, olivia. I can do this.
my limited stint at M.I.T. Did teach me something.
loraine Daisy Alcott.
that's just sad.
one "R.
I think I actually got something to sample in here.
it's some kind of orange gel.
I'm sorry about my father.
he's always been a little... myopic.
her things were left behind, but not his.
checking the thread count?
Yes.
open the cabinet. - Why?
there are gonna be sheets in there.
okay, how'd you do that?
car's right here.
Olivia, what's going on?
that's what he would do.
he's go to motels ahead of time, replace the sheets with leak-proof medical grade linen, so he wouldn't leave any blood evidence.
who?
I know who was in that room. The killer. I know who's profile.
it was a case that john and I worked.
serial murders in New Jersey and New York, and we never caught him.
look, you can't beat yourself up 'cause you didn't catch the bastard on your first try.
I feel like I've been asleep for the last year.
every case that john and I worked together,
I have to go back and try and find whatever I missed.
okay, then, tell me...
how'd the killer do it?
when I joined the F.B.I.
this was one of the first cases john and I investigated together.
each time, he'd kill five young women within a few days.
he's pick them up, take them to motels...
and then he'd give them a muscle paralyzer.
they'd be wide awake, but unable to move.
he's make an incision here, along their gums.
and then he'd pull their mouths open up to their eyes.
okay, that's enough. You can stop right there.
he'd go through their nasal cavity and remove a piece of their brain.
and all of this connects to magic old man baby and pregnant woman how?
I don't know.
but there's a connection somewhere.
the muscle paralyzer he used was bright orange.
so if that's our sample, then I'm telling you, this is our guy.
which... means he's gonna kill again.
I'm Stacy.
Boston FEDERAL BUILDING
memorial services for agent scott are being planned for late in the week.
I know everybody's heard a lot of things surrounding the circumstances of his death.
but I just want to be clear.
John scott was one of us.
and we pay him the respect of considering him innocent until the inquiry can establish the full facts of the matter.
now, as far as any contacts, our official word right now is no comment.
dismissed.
what are you doing here?
I left you a message. - I know, I got it.
you want to open up a 12-year-old serial case.
I don't think he retired.
how long is Broyles gonna have you on special assignment?
what the hell are you working on, anyway?
you knew, didn't you?
about me and john?
I like to think that I have some powers of deduction.
I took advantage of our friendship.
you kept quiet, even though you didn't approve.
I hadn't seen you that happy in a long time.
look, Olivia, you have nothing to prove.
Yeah, I do.
I have to live with the fact that I didn't see him for who he really was.
I have to live with the feeling that whatever awful things he did, - I should have stopped them. - Livy, you can mostly just wanna take a shower from the inside out.
I'll get you the case files.
Stoughton. MASSACHUSETTS
so I--I started working there a couple weeks ago.
it's a lot better than the one in providence.
that place is a total dive.
most guys bring me to a hotel.
look at this place.
those windows have a really great view of the bridge.
I don't care about the bridge.
what do you like?
I like the bridge. Go check it out.
harvard UNIVERSITY hello?
over here.
what are you doing?
I'm doing two things at once.
I'm waiting for you and I'm doing her a favor.
you were supposed to be doing extensive testing.
because a woman gave birth to an 80-year-old man. Remember that?
done.
test is complete. You underestimate me.
which I suppose I deserve.
but... Wonderful news all around.
DNA results confirm my suspicions that the woman was impregnated by a man who's the result of experiments identical to those conducted by me in this very lab, around 30 years ago.
so you know how this happened?
no. No idea.
the specifics elude me completely.
so then what's this wonderful news?
because I remembered something else.
I remembered where I parked my car.
Really?
you remember where you parked your car 17 years ago?
pi to six digits.
I can't fathom that it's still here. Look at it.
this is your car?
of course it is.
so what, you got cars stuffed with papers all over town?
not just cars.
you have no idea where I've hidden things.
friend of yours?
I certainly hope not.
come on, boy, we need to get these file boxes back to the lab.
you may be able to reanimate dead guinea pigs or...
whatever, but I can bring anything mechanical back from the dead.
pituitary EXCISION
this is the last of them.
that'll do. Hello, I'm dr. Walter Bishop.
Yes, dr. Bishop. We've met. I'm junior agent astrid farnsworth.
third time's a charm.
now, Walter, we'd probably be a lot more help to you if you told us what we were looking for.
my research.
sella turcica, diaphragma sellae-- the dural folds of the pituitary fossa, in which the pituitary d sits, situated in the sphenoid bone.
did you just say pituitary gland?
did I?
well, that's how he killed.
he'd perform surgery on his victims, remove the pituitary gland before he overdosed them with anesthesia.
look for anything with the pituitary in it.
I'm sorry. I don't get it.
I mean, what's the link to what happened at the hospital?
advanced, rapid aging, like the disease called progeria, can be induced artificially by manipulating the pituitary gland.
"P"--pituitary. "P," "P.
all the hormones in the human body that control growth, which is aging, really, are in the brain.
and the pituitary gland is the boss.
Ah, yes, Penny. - Progeria.
case file by dr. Penrose?
Yes, Penrose. Penrose!
I remember him.
a former colleague of mine.
although he suffered from severe pseudofolliculitis nuchae.
razor burn. - Hell, no!
we ran experiments on rapid growth.
obviously, someone had made a breakthrough, and Penrose could possibly lead us to that person.
Dr. Claus penrose.
he moved to the east coast two years ago.
he's a professor at Boston college.
agent frances.
Charlie, it's me.
Dunham, what's up?
I need a cross check of recent unsolved homicides.
see if any bodies have turned up with a missing pituitary gland.
Oh, you say the sweetest things.
only to you, Charlie.
I'll get somebody on it.
Boston COLLEGE
Dr. Penrose.
yes?
agent dunham, F.B. I.
can we ask you a few questions?
do you drink tea?
the body you see there was photographed only hours after being born.
where is the mother?
she died during childbirth.
when she was admitted, she claimed she wasn't even pregnant.
you worked with dr. Bishop, manipulating growth hormones at the end of the vietnam war.
Yes. So... what can I do for you?
in the years since, have you shared your research with anyone?
I must tell you both, our work was highly theoretical?
Yes.
but I was going to say that, more than anything, it was wrong.
I resigned from the employ of the united states government after only one year.
when I refused to continue, I was harassed.
threatened... with deportation. It didn't feel like the America I remembered from when I was a boy.
which is why as sorry as I was to hear about dr. Bishop's incarceration,
I believe it is the best thing that could ever happen to humanity.
no one in power should ever learn what he knows.
forgive me for sounding uncooperative, agent dunham, but...
my work to which you are referring ended years ago.
since then, I've done all I can to forget it.
what do you think?
I think you know what I think.
well, he meant what he said.
he's not telling us everything.
Sudbury police has a blonde female victim.
surgical incision along her upper gum line.
the central endocrine gland has been removed.
this count?
can you get the body brought to the lab?
will do.
you're right.
the pituitary gland has indeed been removed.
and I may be able to posit a hypothesis as to why.
years ago, when I worked with the defense department, we were tasked with a program designed to cultivate soldiers.
Cultivate?
quite literally. Grow them.
it was highly theoretical, of course.
female eggs were to be fertilized in a lab and given a cocktail of growth hormones.
if perfected, a baby was born and within three years aged to the equivalent of a 21-year-old male.
a soldier in prime condition.
you're telling me you developed a way to grow soldiers, people.
theoretically.
the only problem was how to slow the aging process once the subject had reached the desired physical age.
once stared, we couldn't turn the aging off.
so you think now what?
that the killer somehow continued your work?
not exactly.
but I believe that someone has made a breakthrough, that the killer is the product.
the test tube human afflicted with rapid aging.
to slow the process, he must extract the hormones from the pituitarylands of his victims to treat himself, to stay young.
then the pregnant woman at the hospital
she was an accident.
and the killer's condition was passed on to the baby.
even condoms are not 100% effective.
you two should be aware of this.
that night, he was going to kill her, but first they fornicated.
had intercourse, sex.
okay, we got it.
she became pregnant, um, but the pregnancy became horribly accelerated.
so someone must have heard her scream.
and he couldn't go through with his plan. He couldn't kill her.
which is why he didn't kill this girl at a motel, because he was scared.
and if his M. O.'S changed, then we have nothing.
we have to go back and start again from the beginning.
no, this is okay. We're making progress
why don't you tell her that everything's going to be okay.
I thought you had a way with women.
the F. B.I. came to see me today.
I know what happened.
you got that woman pregnant.
son, we have to be so careful.
I know.
how's the pain?
getting worse.
Yes, well, we're almost there.
you just need to get one more, and you'll be okay again.
Yes. Yes. Yes!
something on your mind?
please. The term "on your mind" vexes me with its depictive inaccuracy.
Aw, stop. Would you just talk like a person?
what are you thinking?
Jules verne.
20, 000 leagues under the sea jules verne? - Yes.
although I was referring to his lesser-known masterwork, the kip brothers, in which he posited that the last image seen in life, right at the moment of death, is permanently imprinted on the retina of the eye.
also a work of fiction.
which is a small but critical distinction.
when was it you lost your imagination, son?
all right, do you want to play? Let's play.
the only way that we can see what she saw, even in theory, is if we could recover the electric impulses that were traveling along her optic nerve.
which we can't. - Ah, we're in luck.
this woman was given a muscle relaxant.
the drug would have frozen her neural pathways at the moment of death and the last images she saw with it.
okay, assuming we're actually having this conversation, we would still need a...
well, I don't know. We still need something that could translate what she saw something that could translate from her eyes to a monitor.
a tv screen.
I'm sorry about the lab.
I don't usually... - what?
lose control.
to tell you the truth, it was kind of a relief.
you've been so together with everything that's going on,
I was starting to develop an inferiority complex.
knowing that Walter's work is responsible for all those murders...
I just want you to know that you're not alone here.
listen...
I can't believe that I'm about to propose this.
but I--I think...
we've actually figured out a way to track down that psycho.
how?
well, we need a piece of equipment.
it's, uh, laser optic hardware.
very crazy and very, very hard to find.
but as it turns out, only one company has the patent.
massive DYNAMIC NEW YORK please, have a seat. Ms. Sharp will be right with you.
I have reservations about asking massive dynamic for a favor.
the corporate mind always looks for quid pro quo.
can I ask you a question?
of course.
before he died, agent scott suggested that this was more than a coincidence that you recruited me for this assignment.
agent Dunham...
do you mind if I ask you a personal question about you and agent scott?
the very last time you were... intimate...
were you safe?
you weren't, were you?
agent Dunham?
ms. Sharp will see you now.
I hope the ride was comfortable.
I'm not a big fan of airplanes myself.
despite the obvious intellectual understanding of their safety, my hands still get sweaty on takeoff.
thank you again for your cooperation, we're very
no need to thank me. You know, I've been thinking of you.
meaning to thank you for being a woman of your word and keeping massive dynamic out of the press.
I also wanted to say...
you have my sincere condolences on the loss of agent scott.
what do you know about agent scott?
I know that he was your partner.
I've lost people close to me.
I know how hard that can be.
not to mention the rumor about what he was involved with.
and, of course, the joy of being a female in a traditionally male line of work.
no doubt some of your male colleagues are assuming that you two were intimate.
the millimeter wave camera.
travel safely, agent Dunham.
are we ready?
dear, the lights.
goggles, all of you.
do not look directly into the light.
is this really gonna work? - Faith.
never a bad thing to have.
this is taking too long.
if he's already picked up another
impatient! You always were.
as if you ever knew me well enough to make a statement like that.
you're a smart boy. But theris much you don't know.
did you see that? - What was that?
wait, wait. What was that?
can you focus? - It's not a slide projector.
wait... Astrid, can you flip it over? - Yes.
that's a bridge.
I know that bridge.
I used to live in Denton. That's, um, that's Sargent bridge. That's in Stoughton.
what's in Stoughton?
the warehouse district.
this would be one of the last images she saw?
in theory, yes.
where would she have to have been to see that angle of the bridge?
pull up N. R.O. Online, image mapping database.
okay, match the angles.
wait, stop. That's it.
pull out to aerial view and triangulate.
it looks like she's in this warehouse district.
the 1600 block of bond street.
I want satellite images of that area for the last 24 hours.
street sweeper on the access road at 8: 05 P. M.
I got nothing between 6: 00 and 7: 45 P. M.
what are we looking for, exactly?
she died in one of these buildings.
I've got a gray sedan parked outside unit 17 at 8: 05 A. M.
I've got the same vehicle eight hours later.
that's the estimated time of death of our last victim.
if you get anything more specific, call me.
you got it.
it worked, Peter! See that? It worked!
so Lessing... Borrow... Belmont.
hold on--did you say Borrow? Did we pass Borrow already?
there.
stay there.
that's just not gonna happen.
F. B.I! Hands in the air!
I said put your hands up.
she's alive.
is there anyone else here?
you have your phone? - Yeah.
dial 1-7-2-2-4.
ask for Charlie Francis.
tell him we need field assist.
tell him to ping the G. P.S. For the location.
safety's on the right. Do not let him move.
Freeze!
back off!
Hello? Walter, it's peter.
just making popcorn.
Walter, I'm with a woman in her mid-20s.
she is going into cardiac arrest due to an overdose of anesthesia.
her heart just stopped.
do you have any cocaine?
cocaine? No, I don't have any cocaine.
Oh, then too bad.
you'll have to shock her heart.
Yeah, I know that.
unfortunately, I don't have a defibrillator!
Hey, you still there?
what is the optimum voltage for cardiac resuscitation?
try 200 volts.
all right, here it goes.
it's not working.
well, you'll have to crank it, won't you?
Hey, it worked.
good work, son. Good work.
you're gonna be okay.
he--he should have let me die... a long time ago.
I'm not... I...
I was an experiment.
someone... someone paid him.
the man I called my father.
he should have let me die.
that was his mistake.
but he was blinded... because he loved me.
he loved me.
he...
thank you again for your help.
that's what I'm here for.
I hope it served you well.
I'd ask you what you wanted the camera for, but I respect your confidentiality.
well, we're grateful for your help.
seems you're settling well into your new position.
excuse me?
I don't think a woman of your talents should be in public service.
and where should I be?
here, at massive dynamic.
you're offering me a job?
philip broyles is a good man, and his record speaks for itself.
well, I'm sure you got into law enforcement because you wanted to make a difference.
so consider this:
massive dynamic is one of the ten largest economic entities in the world.
our weapons technologies shape the defense department's strategies.
our investments sway the markets and make or break presidential elections.
overseas, we have responsibilities traditionally sacred to the state.
the righto direct private armies, to manage global affairs into stable equilibrium.
you're serious.
Yes, I am.
not to mention, I believe a position here would speed your effort to find answers.
you're referring to the pattern?
among other things.
Penrose took a hit.
forensics tracked a two-mile spatter trail leading from the warehouse out to route one.
local pd's on the look out, and I've ordered checkpoints along the interstate.
but nothing so far.
he's still out there.
listen...
every aspect of these investigations is strictly classified.
all of it.
you understand that?
of course.
certain private individuals have been granted clearance regarding the pattern.
including Nina Sharp.
but that clearance is limited.
I understand.
sure, but, uh...
I'm not clear on what you're getting at.
when you were with her, did she share anything with you?
did she mention the pattern?
did she comment or ask you anything about the details of your investigation?
Yeah, she did.
she said you were a good man.
and that was it?
she offered me a job.
and what did you say to that?
I told her you were gonna give me a raise.
I acknowledge that by signing this document, "I waive my constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure.
I'm not signing this!
I, however, will.
well, of course you will. What have you got to lose?
you're already committed to a mental institution.
you have to sign it too.
I'm not signing my rights away to the federal government.
I already got enough trouble in my life.
about my former colleague and his son.
it's one of the inherent pitfalls of being a scientist.
trying to maintain that distinction between god's domain and our own.
sometimes, I forget myself.
but then, you already know that.
what do you mean?
if you've read my file, then you know the truth about Peter's medical history.
I've been meaning to ask you to-- - Walter...
there was no mention of any medical history.
just his birthday.
I was going to ask you to keep it between just the two of us, but, uh...
I suppose, then, there's no need.
Walter...
you're awake, Peter. Me too.
I was trying to pull myself to sleep.
Yeah, I'M...
I'm aware of that.
I can hear you.
you think you could do that in your head?
wasn't I?
I thought I was. Sorry.
that's okay. Just...
try and keep it down, all right?
son? Is that you?
Yes, Walter, it's me.
just...
stop talking and close your eyes, okay?
St. ANNE'S CATHEDFAL
forgive me, father, for I have sinned.
it's been three months since I've confessed.
go on, my son.
do-- do you believe that god can speak to you, father?
of course I do.
the lord speaks to all of us who are willing to listen.
what about the devil, then?
do you want to confess something, my son?
I'm a good man, father.
I-- I try to be a good man.
but I-- I see things.
I s-- see things.
I don't know why he chose me, but it's happening again.
it's happening again, and I'm scared.
scared of what?
of what's going to happen on the bus.
I want it to stop. Please.
I just want it to stop.
son, have you hurt someone?
son, come back.
Roy!
Hey, let's go buddy, what's the problem?
Oh, my god.
mount BRIAR CEMETERY the souls of the just are in the hand of god.
and no torment shall touch them.
they seemed, in the view of the foolish, to be dead.
and their passing away was thought an affliction.
and their going forth from us, utter destruction.
but they are in peace.
you know, you being here, Libby you did the right thing.
Yeah. The man betrays his country, turning over state secrets to god knows who, - and here we are, pretending he's a hero. - Stop.
Bureau's got one black eye as it is.
the last thing we need right now is another espionage scandal.
you made it through.
it's over now.
did you see john's mother?
she wouldn't stop looking at me.
his mother.
Yeah, like she was blaming me for what happened to him.
like it was my fault he was dead.
as far as John's mother knows, her son died a hero servin' his country.
a hero.
he used me, Charlie.
and he told me he loved me.
I wasn't gonna tell you this, but he said he loved me too.
agent Dunham.
agent Francis.
I need you to come with me.
thank you.
you brought your own sweetener?
don't be ridiculous. It's my medication.
you're not on any medication, Walter.
of course I am.
I been making it myself in the lab.
Oh, I wish you were joking.
you're self-medicating. With homemade drugs.
simple combination of dextromethorphan, clonazepam, and some fluoxetine.
those are psychotics, Walter.
all of them.
of course they are. That's the point.
I have been in a mental facility for the past 17 years.
it's put me quite out of balance. - Right.
stay here for a second, would you?
what if I need to use the bathroom?
just hold it. I'll be right back.
Hello?
What're you doin'?
what, you thought I didn't see you all day?
you were supposed to check in before you came home.
if you tell anybody else that I'm here, you're the first one of the bunch I'm gonna come after.
it was moving. But I stopped it.
there was something important.
I've decided on the pancakes. Blueberry.
that's great, Walter.
did somebody call me on the phone?
that's what was important.
something about a bus.
the incident occurred at 8: 14 am.
middle of rush hour.
first responders were worried it was bioterrorism.
ghosts of the sarin subway incident in Tokyo in 1995.
they called in the cdc, confirmed the attack isn't biological in nature. There's no contingent.
and you said there wasn't any good news.
excuse me.
team's coming in to transfer this bus to a secure area.
I want you to extend the perimeter outside the tunnel another 50 yards.
it's horrible.
they're like mosquitoes trapped in amber.
if this was some sort of attack, why not just use something conventional, like plastic explosives?
a pipe bomb?
impact.
whoever did this wanted attention. I mean, look at that.
or it's not an attack at all.
and it's something else entirely. - Meaning what?
if I knew that, you wouldn't be here.
I imagine that the material was released in gaseous form before solidification.
I need to study it back in my lab. Can I have some?
we'll have to dig out their personal effects so we can id them.
notify their next of kin.
it's not here.
quomodo pergemus?
Roy? What is that?
I don't know.
harvard UNIVERSITY any idea what it is yet?
tricky. Very tricky.
all I've been able to discern is that it starts as a silicon-based aerosol, and it solidifies somehow.
you could be of assistance to me.
I would love to hear some bach.
mass in a minor.
will you play it for me?
I'm sure the young lady down there would get us a piano.
that young lady is an F.B.I agent, Walter.
her name is Astrid, and this is the 100th time you've forgotten her name.
no. I don't think I can get you a piano.
you always resisted your lessons too.
lack of commitment, son. Was always your problem.
imagine that's why you still haven't chosen a profession.
I suppose I should've followed in your footsteps.
cause your work has obviously brought such joy to the world.
who was he, Peter?
sorry?
the man in the restaurant.
you in some kind of trouble?
it was nothing. He was harassing the waitress. I just told him to cut it out.
Oh I see.
excuse me.
can you please extract this camera?
I want you to note all the people on this video.
cross-check them with the victims.
if we're lucky, maybe she caught whoever did-- stop. Go back.
can you close in on that woman?
what is it? - That backpack.
I just saw that woman, that backpack wasn't there.
has anyone seen a blue backpack with the other personal effects?
so someone took the bag from her?
got off the bus before the attack?
who is she?
she's a federal employee.
what's her job?
Oh, my god. She's dea.
the woman who died on the bus, whose backpack was stolen, she was a drug enforcement agent.
undercover. She had a handler, Grant Davidson.
I wanna bring him in for questioning.
I apologize if I wasn't helpful on the phone.
I needed to ask my superiors for clearance to talk to you about Eve.
our condolences.
from her records she seemed like an exemplary agent.
Ah, she was.
can you tell us about the case she was working on?
uh, three months ago she was tasked to infiltrate the east coast representatives of a Nicaraguan drug cartel.
we'd been bangin' on them for over a year.
she called me. Said she wanted me to pull her out.
she was scared.
said she heard members of the cartel discussing something about the pattern.
I told her I never heard of it.
and, uh, we set up a meet but she never showed.
it appears whoever attacked the bus this morning was interested in one of her effects.
do you have any idea what she could've been carrying?
I wish I could be more helpful.
you have been, agent Davidson. Thank you.
uh, I've been asked to officially I. D.Her body.
I suppose that won't be a problem.
have you spoken with her family?
uh, there's a brother she doesn't talk to.
I didn't realize how hard this was gonna be.
you don't have to explain.
I know what it's like to lose someone you've worked with closely.
I'd uh-- I'd like to say good-bye.
of course.
should I bother to ask?
music helps him process.
it works too. As soon as Peter started playing, Walter just kinda locked in.
he was able to recreate the material from the crime scene.
I hear you play the piano.
he doesn't just play. He's good. You should hear him.
no. Maybe some other time.
Olivia. You'll be pleased to hear we figured it out.
the material, the gas that was released on the bus, turned solid when it met the nitrogen in the atmosphere.
instantly immobilizing and suffocating the passengers.
so who would have the know-how to manufacture something like this?
I'll give you six guesses.
and the first five don't count.
three chemical companies in the U. S.Supply those compounds.
all of them fully-owned subsidiaries of massive dynamic.
Charlie? What's up?
we've got something.
I think you're gonna wanna see it.
tip got called in from a priest over at st. Anne' says the guy that lives here mentioned a potential incident about the bus.
before it happened.
so what do we know about him?
name's Roy Mccomb.
high school graduate. No criminal record.
apparently he's been pushin' papers over at an escrow company for the last couple of months.
got bpd picking him up from there right now.
that doesn't seem like the profile of a mass-murderer.
no. I didn't think so either.
what?
you're looking at depictions of dozens of attacks, accidents, disasters, we've seen over the past year.
and look. All of them are dated before the incidents took place.
was that the flight from Hamburg?
so this guy drew flight 627, the Angel suicides in Baltimore, and the Birmingham bridge collapse.
clearly, the man is disturbed.
but do you really think that he could be involved in all this?
no. I don't.
but that doesn't make me any less interested to know where he got his information.
several of those incidents have never been made public.
and based on the evidence, every one of them was either drawn or constructed before the event depicted.
Mr. Mccomb.
I'm special agent Charlie Francis of the F.B.I.
I wanna tell you you're not officially being charged with anything right now.
I'd like to ask you a few questions. Is that okay?
um, yeah. That's-- okay. Sure. Call me Roy.
okay Roy.
start with this drawing of yours.
14 different chemical compounds were used in the material responsible for the incident on the bus.
three of them manufactured exclusively by your subsidiaries.
you've done your homework.
we supply them to a dozen labs around the world.
it could've been stolen from any one of them.
I'll need a list of those labs, then.
of course. Anything you need.
so? Is there anything else?
when we first met, you said that science and technology had advanced to such a state that, your words, "they were running out of control."
that sounds about right.
well so far, all of the science and technology that I've come across has been very tightly controlled by massive dynamic.
every case I investigate has a tie back to this company.
well, I think maybe you have it backwards.
massive dynamic is...
well, so massive that just about everything in the world of science and technology has a tie back to us.
of course, I could say something of the same for you, couldn't I?
you've been investigating these cases for a very short while now.
at least three of them have occurred right in your own backyard.
I might suspect that you yourself were somehow responsible.
I hope it will help you find whoever's behind these attacks.
attacks?
apparently Broyles hasn't told you.
Yes, the technology was used once before in Prague, although there were fewer casualties.
then, I suppose if you had access to the case files, you'd know that we'd already shared all the information we have with the government.
thank you. For the information.
what about this one?
this one gonna happen too, Roy?
look.
I know that this sounds crazy.
in fact, I think I am crazy.
but I can be anywhere, at home or at work, and, uh
just all of a sudden, I get this-- I don't know how to describe it.
this feeling.
and the only way that I can get it out is get rid of it.
is to-- to try to draw what I see.
or to try to build it. Sometimes that works.
how long have you been getting these feelings?
maybe nine months.
nine months.
Roy's feelings-- or whatever they are.
began roughly when we became aware of the pattern.
meaning what?
I'm not entirely sure yet.
but it's hard to say he's lying. - He's not.
I like to consider myself to be a fairly good poker player, which requires me to have the ability to read my opponent's tells, know when he's bluffing.
he's not bluffing.
regardless of what the actual explanation is, he sincerely believes that what he's saying is the truth.
in that case, what do you suggest?
how has he learned of these incidents?
I don't know.
I just saw Charlie. He told me-- - Occam's razor.
all other things being equal, the simplest solution is the best.
and what is that?
the man's psychic.
theoretically, it's all quite possible.
so you're saying roy can read peoples' minds.
I posit that Roy has no control over his abilities.
that he is linked, psychically, with someone, or less likely but still possible, a small group of people responsible for these events.
equally possible, someone who's merely discussing them.
perhaps he's communicating with you, agent Brles.
forgive me, dr. Bishop.
I like to think I have an open mind.
but I have a hard time accepting that that man is hearin' another person's thoughts.
Oh, yes. So do I.
which is why I would like to prove it. And here we go.
and how would you do that?
am I required to keep him alive?
that would probably be best.
can we, uh, talk a moment?
go ahead.
Nina Sharp just told me that this isn't the first time that ma rial from the bus has been used.
I'd normally be skeptical of anything coming from Nina, but in this case, she's correct.
so what?
I don't even have clearance to know background on a case I'm investigating?
agent Dunham, if I'm not always completely transparent with you, there's a reason.
this little task force that you and I call our day job now
it sometimes requires some
shall we say, bureaucratic maneuvering to keep it alive and free from political meddling, which means sometimes I don't tell you everything for your own protection.
with all due respect, that's not good enough.
now, I've been trained for a lot:
hostage crises, terror campaigns, suicide bombers, chemical attacks, but you know the things I've seen since I started working for you.
if I'm gonna do this job, I need to know what it is I'm dealing with.
and you will. When you're ready.
until then, I suppose you'll need to cross me.
so what're we looking for?
if my hypothesis is correct, if he is picking up the thoughts of another human being, it will leave a distinct signature.
and you think we'll be able to identify whose thoughts they are?
that's preposterous.
but they may be able to intercept them.
magnificent machine.
do you mind if we view the axial images?
his vitals are spiking.
what's happening? - No idea.
but I'm extremely interested to find out.
something's wrong!
shut it down, now!
get up. You okay? - I-- I don't know. I-- I think so.
what did that?
something in the blood.
a magnetic compound of some kind.
Dormant-- perhaps a parasite.
what's he saying? I don't understand.
the machine is basically a gigantic magnet, and you've got metal in your blood.
if we hadn't o' turned it off, it woulda ripped your body apart.
woulda been quite a mess.
why would there be metal in his blood? That's not normal, right?
you wanna see everything from 1989.
no. Perhaps '79.
fantastic. That's very helpful.
Oh, stop.
I was right.
belly and I worked on this very problem.
Yeah. As in william bell.
founder of massive dynamic, and one of the richest men on the planet.
he and Walter used to share a lab together.
loved cloves. Awful odor.
we posited a spectrum of waves lying outside of the range of those already discovered.
we hypothesized that these waves could be used to communicate information.
the government, of course, was extremely interested.
it was a brilliant idea.
a theory, but a good one.
they wanted to use the network to send their most clandestine information.
because if no other government knew the spectrum existed, they wouldn't be listening in.
Yes.
and they called it the ghost network.
but they asked us to take it one step further.
to develop a method where they could transmit directly from one person to another.
I surmised that I could introduce an iridium-based, organometallic compound into the subject's brain.
you have got to be kiddie.
what?
Roy Mccomb was one of your test subjects.
of course. Yes!
that explains it, doesn't it?
explains it?
Yes, that explains why he almost died today.
because you injected something into his brain nearly 20 years ago.
no, what I gave him was not nearly enough to cause that reaction.
the compound must have multiplied in his bloodstream over time.
environment, perhaps diet.
he was a sophomore volunteering for psych experiments.
did you ever even bother to explain to him what you were doing?
well it wouldn't have been a very secret experiment if I had.
what's going on? How's Roy Mccomb?
Roy Mccomb will be fine.
no thanks to my father's attempts to turn him into a human walkie-talkie.
wait a second.
don't you try and change the subject!
what you just said is on subject.
the iridium-based compound that multiplied in his bloodstream has turned him into some kind of receiver.
a receiver of what?
transmissions.
someone else, it seems, and I'm somewhat jealous of this, has perfected our ghost network.
and is using it to communicate.
our dear Roy is merely over hearing what they say.
you will note that the rotary movement gives the impression of a three-dimensional tunnel, when in fact it is not.
next slide, please.
Ah, it's an oldie but a goodie.
as you observe this image, your brain perceives first a duck, then a rabbit, then a duck again. It always comes back to the duck.
in truth, the image is neither.
but it illustrates the brain's need to take random sensory input and construct it into a meaningful whole
great. - Despite
thank you. We get it.
uh, I'm sorry. I don't think I do get it.
well neither do I. I just want him to stop.
I'll get the lights.
I suspect someone has continued my research.
but they've taken the easy way out.
merely using the ghost network as a secure telecommunications channel.
you're suggesting that Roy's listening in to someone's telephone network.
Yes. But no, not listening.
Roy's brain is trying to interpret the sensory input.
much as our brains grapple with the duck rabbit, I told you.
it always comes back to the duck.
so if Roy's receiving this frequency, is there any way that we can tap in and hear them?
or maybe even I. D. them?
construct a receiver using that spectrum, it's possible, of course.
but it would take months.
but it may be possible to redirect the transmissions from his visual centers to his auditory cortex.
wait, you want to rewire his brain?
not without his permission.
it would be a minor surgery.
minor brain surgery.
emphasis not on the minor.
I would need a specific piece of equipment.
magnetic neurostimulator I built in 1983.
with a few adjustments, it would work.
all right. We'll just go back in time and get it for you.
no need to.
it's most likely where I left it 17 years ago.
hidden in a wall in our old house in Cambridge.
blast from the past.
what's the game plan here?
we just gonna knock on the door, ask 'em if we can tear out their walls?
pretty much.
I guess the badge is the "pretty please" in that equation.
there's no lights on.
I'm gonna call in. See if we can track down the owner for consent.
What're you doing?
what? This is barely even a crime. I used to live here.
normal pupil response.
taking any medications, prescribed or illicit?
you can be truthful. I won't judge.
in fact, if the answer is no, I may encourage some drug use.
no, none.
any food allergies?
not that I'm aware of.
good, good, good.
this all checks out. Strap him down. We'll get started.
Oh, god. Strap me down?
there's nothin' to be worried about.
I guess, uh-- it must seem pretty silly.
thinking god is talking to me and everything.
what were you supposed to think?
that I was just crazy.
I considered that, too.
it's gotta be sort of a relief, right?
knowing there's a rational explanation?
I wouldn't exactly call any of this rational.
do you really think that this is going to help you catch the guys that killed those people on the bus?
you're our best lead.
no pressure, huh?
we lived here when I was a kid, but after Walt was institutionalized, my mom couldn't afford the mortgage.
so we moved down to an apartment in Austin.
so where's your mother now?
that's a story for another time. So tell me.
of all the possible career choices, how did a girl like you end up in law enforcement?
well, I pretty much knew this was what I wanted to do by the time I was nine.
when I was nine years old, I think I wanted to be a brontosaurus.
they say the psych profiles of cops and criminals are pretty much identical.
ever consider a life of crime?
no dental.
nothing. Of course.
what?
my mom had this covered up.
used to hide in it all the time.
you'll need to be awake for the procedure.
but I'm going to give you a mild sedative to reduce any anxiety.
Dr. Bishop, you look really familiar to me.
I hear that a lot.
in the mental institution where I lived. He'll need a moment.
you've returned.
how was the old house? How is Rufus?
well, the house is just like we left, but we put Rufus to sleep almost 20 years ago, Walter.
that's terrible news.
we found your equipment.
Oh, this brings back some memories.
of what?
I think it's time for some intracranial penetration.
this won't hurt.
just feel a touch odd. - Okay.
is this poli sci 101?
not remotely.
who was it?
freshmen.
I need you to keep this dial steady at 60 hertz10 gauss until I tell you otherwise.
I believe there are clusters of metal in the visual centers of your brain.
I'm going to attempt to move them to those regions which process sound.
you'll be shown a series of images.
I need you to tell me any sensations you experience as you see each image.
sounds easy enough.
first image, please.
it's a horse.
wonderful. 50 gauss.
what the hell was that oh, that was your body's normal muscle response. It's perfectly natural.
you may also experience an involuntary bowel movement.
great.
next image, son.
Oh, man.
Mmm, oh, this is bad. Oh, this is weird.
uh, I-- I'm-- I'm tasting, uh, dirt.
uh, no wait, it's uh, gasoline.
we've reached the gustatory cortex. We're getting close.
next image, please.
I don't know. It's a beach.
well, no sensations at all?
I don't think so.
dammit, don't you feel anything?
uh, I'm a little scared.
I don't understand. This should be working.
Walter, take a deep breath. It's gonna be okay.
- You.
increase the level to 200 gauss.
don't do that! Stop, I said!
what did you say? - I don't know.
I can hear voices.
I think that's latin.
it is. He just said, um-- damn, what's that word?
Hora, um-- hour.
something's happening in an hour.
how in the world can you possibly know that?
I majored in linguistics.
my latin's admittedly a bit fuzzy.
okay, keep going.
that means station.
no wait.
and then
an exchange is being made.
an exchange at south station.
I think someone's meeting at south station to make an exchange in an hour.
he just said, "good, where was it."
- From the beginning, on her person.
it was on her person.
it was on her from the start? Maybe or she had it on her the whole time.
Oh, yeah, that's a possible translation.
where ya goin'?
now, I've been asked to officially I. D. her body.
there was a three-inch incision in Evelina's right palm.
whatever she had on her, davidson cut it out.
she was hiding it in her hand.
I'm heading to south station now.
I think he's planning a hand-off at 5: 00.
we have to assume Davidson's workin' for the same people who hit the bus.
I'll notify CI.
but in the meantime, I'm sending the field assist your way.
but plainclothes only. We don't want to tip him off.
Oh, my god.
what's wrong?
I believe with proper demodulation, you could receive satellite television for free.
okay. Fun time's over.
Astrid, let's get him unhooked.
it's me, I'm at the station.
where am I meeting your man? - Excuse me?
I'm getting something.
it's in English.
we can see you.
outside south station.
we're verifying you haven't been followed.
then we'll instruct you further.
it's Olivia.
Hey, Roy's talking again.
are you at south station?
Yeah. Why? - So are they.
did you get anything else?
they're checking to make sure that Davidson wasn't followed.
I think that's it for now. - Okay. Thanks.
could I get a drink or something?
Yeah. I'll get you a glass of water.
go ahead.
we're clear on our end. Go inside.
here you go.
and head to the Dewey Square exit.
you got that?
how will I recognize the person I'm meeting?
they'll recognize you.
Yeah.
it's happening now.
he's headed to the Dewey Square exit. - Got it.
Francis.
we got him. He's at the south end of the terminal.
turn around and put your hands in the air now.
what happened? - He's been shot. He's not breathing.
call in a medevac!
the case. They've made the exchange.
he's running. - Stay with him.
put the case on the ground.
drop the gun now!
put your hands where I can see them.
all that trouble for this.
so any idea what it is?
not yet.
but I'm hoping our friends at the NSA will be able to tell us.
so 11 innocent people die today, we risk losing another by drilling through his head, all for something we know nothing about?
do you ever smile, Dunham?
we id'd the shooter.
when we ran his fingerprints, he popped up on two other pattern-related cases.
we're digging into his financials, travel records.
linkage, Dunham.
not only can we now put a face to these people, but we know they're communicating.
and how.
I'd say that's an impressive day's work.
which brings me to this.
what is it?
of all the models in Roy's apartment, three of them are incidents that we haven't been aware of.
pattern cases.
it would seem so.
take a look. If you want.
let me know if you have any thoughts.
I'll do that.
I'll see you torrow.
how are you feeling?
my head hurts a little, but, um, dr. Bishop gave me something for the pain.
vicodin. That's it. I promise.
so no more transmissions.
no.
my guess is once you arrived at south station with the cavalry, they realized the ghost network was compromised, and stopped broadcasting on it.
well just in case, if you hear anything else, do me a favor, gimme a call.
I will.
it felt really nice to be able to help.
thank you. - You're welcome.
I have a few release forms I need you to sign, - and then I can take you home. - Okay.
Dunham. Any requests?
how 'bout some bach?
Bach? No, that's way too stuffy.
what you need is some jazz.
well I'll take what I can get.
I'm sure you can understand why I don't wanna go through channels.
if I know you at all, this isn't the only reason you're here.
is this because of our interest in agent Dunham?
seems a bit early to be poaching my newest hire, with only a three-case resume under her belt.
I didn't achieve my position without the ability to evaluate someone's talents immediately.
neither did I.
Oh, you feel protective of her, don't you?
I'm in the business of protecting all my agents.
I want nothing but the best for her.
of course you do.
we found another one.
let's see what we have.
well, crystalline structure's intact.
no detectable oscillations.
this may just be what we need to break the encryption.
speaking of which, I'm told you've made progress.
see for yourself.
we finally stabilized the link.
we've been pulling information from the disk for the last 72 hours.
let me know when it's finished.
WORESTER, MASS.
you're gonna be late!
Oh, look at yourself.
tuck in your shirt.
put a comb through your hair, for god's sake.
Dara's son, he always takes care of his appearance.
meager. - It's mee-gar.
late again and you're making personal calls?
Oh, no, I'm-- - who's this?
nobody.
she your girlfriend? - No, she came with the phone.
what are you stalking this girl?
no.
are you kidding me?
Aw, come on. Unbelievable. Two in one week.
your sweep's leaving, meager.
get on it... or get another gig.
Hi, how are you today?
and we're still on for the regional manager's meeting Tomorrow at 4: 00?
great.
Yeah, thank you. Okay, great.
okay, thank you. Bye-bye.
Oh, I'm so-- I did not mean to interrupt.
no problem.
don't you usually have the little tablet thingy with you?
ye. Uh, I usually do.
is there something else, or...
I used to be a webelo.
And?
um, the webelos... cub scouts? Your brownie patch.
Oh, yeah.
no, I-- I actually found that online.
it's kitschy, right? I was gonna put it on one of my jackets.
Oh, that's-- oh, that's, uh-- yeah, that's cool.
Hey, Bethany, we still on for drinks tonight?
of course. You better not keep me out too late this time.
we'll see.
no, no, no, no. No, no, please. Don't do this to me!
no. What happened? Damn it! Oh, my god!
do not crash on me. This is not happening.
hold it! Hold it! Please hold the elevator.
I've got to find an I.T.Guy. This is a disaster.
Oh, you dropped your ph
are you okay? - Get away from me!
no.
stop it! Stop it!
stop it!
Boston MASS
I'm telling you because you knew about john and you didn't say anything, so I trust you.
at least enough for me to not think you're gonna think I'm crazy.
Oh, of course not.
I saw him last night.
you saw john.
Yes, in my kitchen.
Hello, Liv.
I grabbed my gun, but he was gone.
I know he wasn't there. Obviously.
I--I just
let me see. You fall in love with your partner...
who betrays you... and your country.
he dies in your arms.
then he shows up in your kitchen and you're wondering if that's grounds to recuse yourself.
Yeah, okay, well, we can start with that.
I say no.
you're the one that exposed him.
bare minimum, that makes you indispensable.
you want my ad ce?
next time john shows up for a nightcap...give him one.
I'm being serious. - So am I.
you think a few weeks pass and everything you went through just goes away?
don't fight it.
don't beat yourself up.
you're good at that.
that's a character flaw.
it'll get easier.
harvard UNIVERSITY
did she say what it was about?
Olivia? No. She'll tell us when she gets here.
how are you feeling?
never been better.
you look quite the opposite.
maybe that's 'cause I had a little trouble sleeping last night.
Oh, I had trouble sleeping myself.
I was thinking about that man.
the one who tortured you.
something about him.
so familiar.
Peter, when I was in St. Claire's
we don't have to talk about this. It's not important.
but it is important.
you cannot imagine what it's like for a man like me to not have access to parts of his mind.
you're doing fine, Walter.
Dr. Bishop. Peter.
Ah, visiting hours.
everybody put on their best straight jacket.
at approximately 10:17 A. M.
a massive power surge struck a downtown high-rise in Worcester, Massachusetts.
as a result, an elevator on the 26th floor plummeted straight to the basement.
eight passengers died.
did the cable snap?
that's what's strange.
the elevator didn't fall.
it drove itself into the ground.
that's not possible.
nine months ago, a maglev train in Tokyo plowed through a crowded station.
in reality, caused by a power surge of unknown origin.
intelligence chatter speculated that it might be a demonstration of a new weapon technology.
it's possible that this morning's event was another demonstration.
to override the elevator's circuitry would require a
a discharge of immense power and precision.
I've made arrangements for you to be received at the building.
we need to know what happened, how it happened, and who's behind it.
I'm Peter Simmons, the building's engineer.
Olivia Dunham, FBI.
this is my team, Peter bishop and Dr. Walter bishop.
so you've been briefed on what's happened?
damn elevator powered itself into the floor. Never seen anything like it.
shouldn't the brakes have come on automatically?
well, that's the thing. They did.
I mean, the safety's clamped onto the rails all right, but for some reason, the motor just kept going.
nearly melted the shoes, which is technically
impossible?
Yeah, we're seeing a lot of that lately.
you know your elevators.
mit drop-out.
is there any security camera footage?
Nope. All the cameras fritzed.
Hey, can you people move out of there?
FBI coming through.
so how could an elevator drive itself?
it's almost like another generator came online, jacked into the system, and overloaded it with double or triple the voltage.
exit wound burns.
Subconjuctival hemorrhages.
this woman displays all of the symptoms of a classic
thermoelectric trauma.
what are you two saying?
he's saying that all these people were electrocuted.
electrocuted.
may I?
that's lovely. 24 carat gold.
traces of nickel, possibly cobalt.
how are you doing that?
this entire space is charged with electromagnetic energy.
far beyond that which occurs in nature.
there's still residual magnetic energy from whatever electrocuted these people.
I need to examine the victims' belongings.
and one of the bodies as well.
are you saying you may know how this happened?
no, not yet.
but I can tell you every one of the passengers in this elevator was dead by the time they hit the ground.
I've worked on a project where I've seen this before.
the government had asked me if it was possible to make a human being trackable by pigeons.
like homing pigeons?
what possible use could that serve?
well, I'm sure it had something to do with the commies.
it always did back then.
regardless, our theory was that human beings are merely highly complex electrical systems.
battery, please, Olivia.
the heart, the brain driven by electrical impulses.
and because everyone has a unique electromagnetic signature, like a fingerprint, then we theorized that properly altered, pigeons should be able to hone into that signature.
like the way they know how to fly south for the winter.
precisely.
but the human field was too weak, so we tried to augment it and make it strong enough for the birds to detect.
did it work?
Oh, yes.
but the side effects negated our plans.
there was one test subject, every time she hiccupped, the lights would dim.
so you're saying these people could control electronic devices?
no, not deliberately.
but I did surmise that it should be possible.
did you just make that thing come back to life?
no, not in this particular instance.
but it does confirm my theory.
what theory?
didn't I say? - No.
well, someone has pursued this idea.
they have amplified a person's electromagnetic field.
and in fact, it is the residual energy from that person that is making this heart pump.
and further, it is that person who is responsible for the deaths in the elevator.
so you don't think it was a weapon that electrocuted those people?
no. It was a human being.
accident occurred just after 10:00 A.M. Here at the Herndon building in downtown Worcester.
Hey, Ron wanted to see you.
haven't yet been released, dropped 26 stories to their death when the building's elevator system failed catastrophically.
what's wrong with you?
you look sick.
excuse me, Mr. Boynton.
where have you been?
excuse me?
do you remember last week what I said to you?
the words I used? How sympathetic I was?
what did I-- what did I say?
that--that you-- yeah, that you were watching my performance.
I said you had to stay on the damn grid and stick to the schedule.
because the system here, even when things are working, depends on people like you being, at the very least, reliable.
I've--I've-- had a really hard day.
guess what?
your day is fantastic compared to mine.
no, it's not.
what the hell's on your uniform? - What?
what is that?
I don't--I don't know. And I'm--I'm not sure.
I'll tell you what. I'll make it easy.
it's not your uniform anymore.
get your ass down to the locker-- - wait.
take it off and leave it there.
no, but--but please.
I take care of my mother.
Yeah, and I take care of my family.
and one of the ways I do that is to employ smart, reliable, capable people.
and you are none of those things. - Please.
you're fired. Go.
Mr. Boyn-- - get outta here, Meager.
I don't want to see you in this building anymore.
get the hell outta here!
here.
Thanks.
I thought you left hours ago.
I could say the same about you.
what are you reading?
neural distortion in human subjects.
and what's all this for?
I'm just trying to wrap my head around an idea Walter had.
he believes that it may be a person who was responsible for the Herndon incident.
not a person wielding some kind of device.
a person who has somehow developed the ability to affect, or maybe even control, electrical devices.
and I suppose the good doctor has a theory how that's possible.
he thinks this person was altered in some way.
extensive procedures. Chemical therapy.
what?
in the course of investigating other pattern cases, we've come across a handful of clinics.
off the grid operations that solicited clients by making the same kinds of claims you see advertised on tv at 3:00 A.M.
only they weren't actually providing weight loss or hair growth.
what were they really doing?
have you ever heard of a man named Jacob Fischer?
no.
doctor of biotechnology.
wanted in four states and three countries for illegal human experimentation.
surgical alterations, radical hormone therapy.
using average citizens as unwitting guinea pigs.
one subject was pumped full of stimulants and kept awake for a solid year.
fed on a steady visual diet of horrific images.
I only bring it up because if Dr. Bishop is right, and there is a person with these extraordinary capabilities, it might very well be that someone made him this way.
I'd like to read the files on Dr. Fischer.
I'll have them transferred to your terminal.
but it's not easy stuff to look at.
Hello?
Hey, Liv.
it's okay. It's okay. It's just me.
I know this doesn't make any sense to you.
 Even if it did, I know you don't have any reason to trust me.
but that's what I'm asking you to do.
we don't have much time.
I'm here to help.
you tried to kill me.
no, Liv.
I loved you.
you know that.
you know I loved you.
I did. Always.
I can prove it to you.
but not here. It's
it's just not the way it works.
you're on the right track.
I'm here to tell you that.
you're looking for a person, but Jacob Fischer is after him also.
you need to get to him first, before Fischer can use him.
use him for what?
use him for what?
how do you know that?
I will prove it, Liv.
that I love you. Always.
but not just yet. You're just gonna have to wait.
maximum...
there were weight sensors in the elevator.
so just before impact, the car weighed 1,440 pounds.
the combined weight of the victims, 1,275 pounds.
leaving a discrepancy of 165 pounds.
meaning someone walked out of there alive.
okay. Somebody got lucky. So what?
Walter's theoretical test subject.
I think he's real and that this might be him.
the only problem with that scenario is that it doesn't make sense.
if he was in the elevator car, he should've been electrocuted just like everybody else.
and that's if the impact didn't kill him first.
not necessarily.
if this person is both the source and the conductor of a large amount of electrical current, then it could well induce a form of electrodynamic levitation.
that's the technology behind maglev trains.
they essentially float on an electromagnetic cushion.
so he floated.
like my necklace in the elevator?
um, no, but...
it is possible that he could've levitated long enough to escape the brunt of the impact.
that still doesn't make sense.
if you can sabotage machines, you wouldn't sabotage one you're in.
unless it was unintentional.
an accident.
maybe whoever we're looking for isn't in control of their abilities.
maybe they don't even know what they're doing.
then we shouldn't be looking for big events. We should be looking for small ones.
unintentional ones.
Oh, come on! Damn it!
just a small discharge.
negligible compared to the voltage coursing through that elevator.
I say we need to find this person and soon.
before he finds out exactly what he's capable of.
wool socks.
Charlie, thanks for waking up the team.
sure, look, we got reports of anomalies clustered around the outlying parts of Worcester and the Herndon building.
parking garage, gates, automatic doors, a few cctvs.
well, we need more. Enough to discern a pattern.
you know, saying somebody's doing all this.
you do know that's crazy, right?
if it weren't, we wouldn't be looking for him.
Mmm, Joseph. - Mom.
what time is it?
where the hell have you been? - Mom.
I think I made a big mistake.
you? Surprise.
no, pl-- please just listen to me. Please.
a few months ago, I was reading this magazine, and there was this ad in the back about tapping into your hidden potential, you know?
and I--I figured it couldn't hurt.
so I went down to this office.
they did some tests. - Did you give them money?
no, just listen
what the hell's the matter with you?
they put me under some hypnosis. I don't know.
and they--they said they were gonna, uh, realign the electrical impulses of my brain.
make it mimic a more confident person.
no, but they did something to me! They changed me. I can't remember.
and now all these things have been happening.
I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.
what do I-- I'm dying
stop it! Get a hold of your-- - damn it, mom!
for once, please! Please help me.
pills.
Oh, my god, oh, my god. No, no, no, please.
pills.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
you don't have to be scared, Joseph. We want to help you.
we're here to adjust your medication.
you did this to me. What did you
what...
looking for anything unusual.
systems going offline, random power surges.
Hey, I've got another incident.
hold on.
guy lost his hand in a conveyor malfunction.
bicoastal parcel? - Yeah.
I gotta call you back.
what?
Herndon building security sign-in sheet.
she was found dead.
a pacemaker malfunction.
Olivia thinks they may have found our guy.
Yeah, now we just have to find him.
time of death was around 1:15 A.M.
so god knows where he could be by now.
ask her what's visible in the event perimeter.
electronic, specifically.
Walter wants to know what's in the apartment.
what kind of gadgets. uh, specifically electronics.
um, okay, there's a answering machine.
an answering machine.
telephone. - Telephone.
boom box. - Boom box.
fan. - Fan.
B--boom box. That's a device for playing music.
cassette tapes, yes?
Yes, but now's not really the time.
anything else, Olivia? - television.
a television.
lamps. - a lamp.
pay attention, would you? We're doing this for you.
tell Olivia to come home.
I know how to find him.
so... so what is this?
this is the sort of work I was born for.
you were hoping for something more specific, maybe?
everyone has a unique magnetic fingerprint.
I said that, yes?
but it is limited.
barely traceable, except in people like Mr.
what's his name?
but since Mr. Meegar has been enhanced, he'll give off a stronger signal than your average joe.
so what's that got to do with the cassette tape?
the cassette tape is as simple as it gets.
once exposed to a magnetic field, it remains permanently magnetized.
given the strength of mister...
Meegar's electromagnetic signature, plus his proximity to the tape,
I have little doubt that that cassette has been imprinted with Meegar's electrical signature.
it--it's kind of like when a film camera double-exposes a picture.
now we just take out the music and see what we have left.
wait, wait, wait-- there it is.
that's him. That's Mister... Meegar. Yes.
now to find Meegar.
how? - Birds.
wait, you mean that pigeon thing?
you believe we can find him using pigeons?
it's possible.
as I've said, I can program carrier pigeons to track a strong electromagnetic field.
we have his signature.
now all we need are birds.
I--I wish you told me earlier, because then I could've been working on it.
so how many?
not many. Two dozen.
two dozen. Great.
wait... where am I?
tell Fischer he woke up.
what is-- what is this place?
Hey, what are you doing?
what are you-- no, no, no! No, wait, no--please! Please, please, please!
you ready?
Yes, ideal.
Walter, you're not gonna accidentally fry one of those pigeons?
stranger things have happened.
that's his motto.
as I said, ons contain tracesof magnetite in their beaks.
like hundreds of tiny compass needles.
the tesla coils will create an artificial electromagnetic field, which I have already matched with mister...
uh, whatever's unique signature, and will now imprint onto the pigeon.
so we set all of these birds free and they...
fly to Joseph Meegar.
Yeah, I know. Me too. I'll believe it when I see it.
step back. Work to be done.
GPS chip's ready? - Yep.
so we're putting GPS chips on carrier pigeons to find a man who can control electricity?
I have you to thank for that, don't I?
Yeah, that's me.
No!
you listened.
you're not real.
the last time we spoke, you listened.
you stay the hell away from me.
I didn't betray you.
you know that. In your heart.
you know I wasn't the one.
I think this bird thing might actually work.
you okay?
Yeah.
Hey, Charlie.
Oh, thanks.
did I miss anything?
I think the show's about to start.
I know we've only been together for a short time, but I think I'm going to miss them.
such majestic creatures.
they're rats with wings.
you'll get over it.
all right, GPS is active.
excellent. Then we're ready.
ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.
start it up.
come on, come on.
are you sure this is gonna work?
of course not.
seriously, if this works
you're gonna have some more faith in your father?
no.
so what do we do now?
we gotta tie the GPS to the mainframe.
genius.
and we're in.
and there are the birds.
I don't see them.
Yeah, we lost the birds.
they're going northwest towards Mill street.
we're approaching Mill now.
uh, make a left.
take a left.
I see them.
all right, we got 'em. I see 'em.
glad you got the car washed?
what is that?
it is unfair. And I appreciate that.
the position you find yourself in now must be so surreal for you.
Oh, my god! What did you do to me? My head... hurts so much.
those had to be subdermal. They can be removed later.
what am I doing here?
No...NO...NO...
you don't realize what you are.
I'm scared. Okay?
you wanted to be confident.
that's why you came to us.
no, I don't want to be confident.
I don't need to be confident.
but you are now.
I just want my life back!
I just want to go back to how it was, please!
look what science has made you, Joseph.
you are special. - No.
make a right on Tempest.
take your next rig.
all right, I think they've stopped.
there.
all right, I got 'em. I see 'em.
okay, we're heading there now.
then our work is done. Good luck.
Hey, you stay here.
whatever you say, boss.
I'm not gonna ask. - Good.
what is it?
visitors. Front entrance.
take him out through the back. Wait at the depot. You'll be contacted there.
what about you? - He's the priority.
no movement.
stand back.
where are you taking me?
get in. Get in the car!
get those hands up.
I said get your hands in the air.
where is he?
I'm sorry. Who?
take upstairs.
we'll go around.
Freeze!
stop!
stop !
they're gonna keep him heavily sedated for a while.
don't want him pulling his whole electro-man thing.
Mr. Meegar.
miss, no one will tell me where I'm going.
to the hospital.
they're going to perform some exams.
check to see that your head's okay.
and then I'm gonna have some questions for you.
I want to go home.
I didn't want to hurt anybody.
we're going to help you.
that's what they said.
please... I want to go home.
I'm afraid we can't let you do that.
that one can go out the back. Thank you, my dear.
what's my name?
starts with "A." Yes?
Astrid. - I knew it.
Peter told me to tell you, if I saw you, that he was returning the pigeons.
Walter, What's...
it's milk. From Gene. Do you want some?
I'll pass. - Are you certain?
the color in your face. You're looking a little pallid.
are you feeling well?
fine.
I'm a little tired. That's all.
well, I don't yet know you well enough to ask this, but, uh...
you haven't seemed yourself lately.
I haven't been sleeping very well.
I've been...
nothing.
see you tomorrow.
you've been seeing him.
your friend. John Scott.
I'm not surprised.
there is a reason.
I've been having hallucinations.
no. Not hallucinations.
what's happening?
I can't be sure.
the brain is a mystery.
but I believe when you were in the tank, that part of his consciousness crossed over into yours.
and it's still there.
his memories.
experiences, thoughts.
you understand me, yes?
these aren't memories.
he appears right in front of me. He talks to me.
Yes, he would.
like a waking dream.
because he doesn't belong there.
there's only room for one voice in your head, not two.
this is your brain's way of working it out.
your mind is expelling him.
exorcising his thoughts.
he'll go away. Is that what you're saying?
I don't know.
do you really want him to?
our team's still cataloging all the files that we found in the cellar.
apparently John Scott was conducting his own investigations.
did the files give any indication of who he might've been working for?
not that we can see.
but it appears that many of the cases were pattern-related.
he knew about the pattern.
he also knew about our friend Dr. Fischer.
in fact, he knew quite a bit more than we did.
including seven other potential Josephs that Fischer was subjecting to treatments.
fortunately, none of them had activated yet.
we were able to locate all seven.
medical services is examining them now.
but they appear to be fine, thanks to you.
Fischer's still refusing to cooperate, but I suspect six weeks in solitary might change his mind.
well, I hope you're right about that.
and there was also something else.
John Scott's personal effects.
it would seem some of them were intended for you.
I will prove it, Liv, that I love you.
always.
...
Hey, do you need a menu?
you okay? Do you want some food?
there's a wicked good vegetable soup.
Hey, give me a soup. - Onion?
no, vegetable. No one likes the onion.
and call Marty, would you? - Marty? How come?
there's some woman here who might be in trouble.
she might need some help.
here you go.
thank you.
I used to love those crackers.
when I was kid, my mom would always get pissed at me because whenever we went out to eat,
I'd always eat like three packs before the food came, and then I'd be stuffed.
what happened there?
not that it's any of my business.
I'll leave you alone if you like.
I'm trying to remember.
I was at Thurber's. - Hey, Marty.
I'll just have a soda.
how you doing tonight?
you live around here?
I do. I live in the area.
haven't seen you around.
I know I was born in Boston.
Oh, yeah? You were born there?
so, uh, where do you live now? Where's home?
I don't remember. They...
they did things.
who did things?
I-- I don't--I don't know. They
they gave me a red medicine. - Yeah?
so, uh, what was the red medicine?
they didn't tell me.
okay, that's all right.
and, um, a blue one. There was blue.
they-- they confused me. They...
hurt me, and
ma'am, I think you should come with me. - No.
I can help you. - No!
no, no, no, you're not in any trouble. - No, stop--stop it!
you need to talk to somebody. - Stop it!
this is officer Pitts. I've got a 5150.
can you make sure that Hannah's available tonight, please.
I need an ambulance at the diner right away! Right now!
what the hell is this?
what?
Oh, that doesn't bother you?
are you kidding?
that man falls asleep counting pi to the 101st digit. That's soothing.
was I humming?
I thought it was in my head.
it wasn't.
forgive me, Olivia. Nothing sings like a kilovolt.
unique pitch.
nothing else in nature quite like it.
I'm sure you're right.
what's up? What's on your mind?
short fuse today, I guess.
indeed, the tension in your voice indicates that you're carrying a heavy psychic burden.
tortured by the depths of some
Hey, Walter, I think she liked it better when you were humming.
the incident occurred approximately six hours ago.
all we've been able to determine so far is that they were exposed to high levels of radiation.
last night was the first time anyone had seen her in two weeks since she was reported missing by her parents.
police officer inside responded to a psych disturbance, which would explain why we found her in handcuffs.
you think she was a runway?
her parents say no.
they say she was perfectly happy.
in fact, she'd just been accepted to a masters program she was excited about.
curiously, the level of radiation ming from emily's body is almost three times as great as the rest.
are you saying that she was the source?
don't know.
Dr. Bishop, any thoughts?
Yes.
where can I get one of those white suits?
Oh, yeah. There's no head.
she was sick. Most like bellini's lymphocemia.
striped bruising on her neck and upper arms.
you know what he's talking about?
bellini's lymphocemia. It's an auto-immune disease. Irreversible.
the body destroys its own muscles and organs.
meaning it's fatal. - Yeah.
though I've never seen bellini's cause a victim to lose her head.
and what's more curious, This woman seems to have been in remission. Cured even.
the rash appears to be healing. Bruises receding.
how do you cure a disease that's incurable?
I haven't the slightest idea, though I myself once cured this one in a dream.
opium. Fantastic stuff.
thanks for the warning.
121 degrees.
that's counter-indicative for a hemorrhagic tumor.
most likely water molecules excited all at once.
he means the guy's brain was boiled.
like a Maine lobster.
I need this body and the headless one taken back to my lab.
Walter, her disease. If there's no cure
well, that's the question.
and one which we should pose to whoever was treating her.
which makes three questions.
the other one being, what exactly happened here?
that's only two questions. - Oh, is it?
Oh, the third question!
um, could I get some of this onion soup? It looks delicious.
agent Dunham?
Nadim Patel. Pleasure to meet you.
thank you, thank you very much for taking the trouble to talk to me.
of course. I've been told you have news about Emily Kramer.
unfortunately, I do. Emily was found dead last night.
what? How?
I'm not at liberty to discuss that with you.
forgive me. I'm just...
emotional investment in patients. It's an occupational hazard.
her poor parents must be devastated after everything they've already been through.
Yes, and I hate troubling you about this, but we understand that emily was suffering from a fatal disease that had recently gone into remission.
that's right.
do you have any idea how that's possible?
medically, no.
were you treating her with any sort of radiation therapy?
radiation? No. Why?
the--the circumstances surrounding Emily's death were unusual.
and it's possible that her condition may have been a factor.
I'll get you her records if that'll help. - Yeah.
she was finally starting to live again.
do I really need to be here?
couldn't you just use a clamp?
of course I could. But I enjoy the company.
quality time, as they say.
yeah,'cause this is just like throwing around the old pigskin.
what's that smell?
hyacinth, my third favorite flower.
associated in mythology with rebirth, which in this case is cruelly ironic.
it's coming from her?
indeed, which indicates either a mutation of the genetic level, or she was eating flowers.
perhaps her perfume.
how's it coming? - Oh, Olivia, join us.
we've learned some things.
we don't think she ran away.
ligature marks.
so she was being held against her will.
either that or she had a proclivity for sexual bondage.
scientific observation, not a judgment.
some of my fondest memories
Oh, Walter stop. Wherever that's going is just wrong.
there's also this. Subcutaneous injection marks.
she was being given medicine intravenously.
so whoever was holding her captive was giving her drugs.
Yes, but not the enjoyable kind.
in fact, quite unlike anything I've ever seen before.
you okay?
should I be?
so how'd she end up in the diner?
did she escape? - Perhaps not.
there are two distinct methods in scientific experimentation.
lab trials or field trials.
you're suggesting they may have let her go on purpose?
whoever did this wanted to make sure what they did to her was working.
so there was something inside her that killed those people at the diner. And her
noggin? I'm not sure yet. It's a theory.
obviously I'll be more certain once we identify the substance.
or when whoever did this... - hey, charlie.
tries to repeat their results.
you mean if they take another woman.
judging by agent Dunham's body language, I'd say she's receiving that very news.
okay.
ACTON...
missing persons called in another case four hours ago.
her name is Claire Williams.
she was diagnosed with bellini's lymphocemia three years ago.
someone's targeting people with the disease?
that or it's one hell of a coincidence.
Hey, Liv. I get it.
you get what?
young woman, what was done to her.
you know, this coming your way today of all days.
it's okay. I'm okay.
listen, I know you don't like to celebrate, but happy birthday.
Olivia Dunham, Charlie Francis, FBI.
Claire. Did you find her?
I'm afraid we don't have new information.
but we do need to ask you a few questions.
her name is Emily Kramer.
she's suffered from the same disease as your wife.
you seen her before?
another case? What--what happened to her?
do you know her, Mr. Williams?
no, I-I don't think so.
we don't know anyone else with bellini's I mean, what we went through fighting claire's disease.
and the constant pain.
when the lesions started appearing, she stopped going out.
that damn disease almost took everything from us, even our marriage.
and then... it was like a miracle.
a miracle?
she started getting better. The pain went away.
she went into remission?
about six weeks ago.
she was herself again.
and now...
please find my wife. Please find her for me.
what's happen?
please don't hurt me.
the last one was a test. This one counts.
is she a candidate? - Even better.
let's get started then.
to understand what happened at the diner, we'll use Mr. Papaya.
clear!
this is upsetting because he's the friendliest of fruits.
and we have goo-ification.
is that the scientific term? - Wait.
the show's not over yet.
is that what you think happened to the people in the diner?
that beam emits high energy microwaves which cause Mr. Papaya's molecules to vibrate rapidly, causing friction and producing heat.
it's like how a microwave oven cooks food.
only in Emily Kramer's case, she was the oven.
but then what killed Emily?
this demonstration is far more effective with living tissue.
I have some expendable gerbils in the back. - No.
Oh, it's no trouble. I'm sure you'd like it.
Walter, just drop it.
wait, am I missing something?
how is it that Emily is, um, cooking people?
in her blood I found traces of radioactive isotopes.
strontium 90.
I believe that these microscopic capsules are designed to release just the right amount of radiation at specific times to cure her disease.
so you think these capsules saved her life.
think of it like time-released chemotherapy.
Oh, yes, but in Emily's case, the cure also made her a perfect candidate for weaponization.
whatever was injected into her bloodstream caused these capsules to burst all at once, sending out a microwave blast.
and perhaps given her own head was the source of energy--kaboom.
so Emily's rheumatologist, Dr. Patel, would he have access to these sorts of isotopes?
it's doubtful.
they only use them in a couple of therapies, and they're really strictly regulated.
Why? You think Patel had something to do with this?
I don't know.
but 83% of kidnap victims are abducted by someone they know.
I'm gonna go and talk to Emily Kramer's parents.
I'll come with you.
Oh, Peter! If you're going out, could you bring me back some cotton candy?
cotton candy. - Yep.
blue, not pink. I've had a craving. Must be the hyacinths.
lovely blue flowers.
you're probably way ahead of me on this already, but I'm noticing certain uncomfortable similarities between this and some of the other incidents we've been covering lately.
more humans are being used as guinea pigs.
my points is, if this is part of the pattern, what if these people aren't just experiments?
what if somebody is preparing for something?
maybe we should come back later.
before or after they do to Claire Williams what they did to Emily Kramer?
Olivia, this is a wake.
these people are mourning their child.
no. Don't you need a warrant for this?
Hey, Olivia, stop!
okay, crashing a wake is bad enough, but rifling through a dead girl's things?
it's the only hope of finding a solid lead, so please help me.
what is it that we're looking for?
anything, any connection she may have had
what are you doing in here? Who are you?
what are you doing in my daughter's room?
Mrs. Kramer, we're terribly sorry about your loss.
we're with the FBI. - FBI? Today? You come here today?
Mrs. Kramer, please listen to me. Another girl's life is at stake.
what do you mean? What other girl?
her name is Claire Williams. - Claire?
what's happened to Claire?
you know her?
a therapist told her to write through the pain and the alienation that she felt.
it was all she had until the treatments.
the treatments?
for her bellini'S. Emily and Claire both had the disease. That's how they met.
here.
they became such good friends.
why'd you lie to me, Mr. Williams?
we met Emily at the hospital waiting for blood tests.
she and Claire started talking, sharing horror stories about their disease.
they became friends.
one night over dinner, the conversation turned to how the medical establishment had abandoned us.
see, there's only 3, 000 people in this country who suffer from bellini'S.
not enough for the drug companies to make a profit, so they're not looking into developing a cure.
and we started talking to some other people we met who also had the disease.
a microbiologist, an investment banker, the mother of a professional athlete.
started thinking about what we could do if we pooled our resources.
so Claire and Emily were treating themselves.
we didn't have a choice. We were desperate.
we tried radical therapies normal doctors wouldn't touch.
three months ago we found a cure.
time-released radioactive capsules.
I don't understand. Why lie?
because the people we love are depending on it.
I couldn't take the chance you'd stop that.
Claire wouldn't want that.
it's what gave us our lives back.
Mr. Williams, we will need the names of the other patients involved.
I could give you some, but I don't know all of them.
you'll have to ask Dr. Nadim Patel.
Emily's doctor.
he knew this was going on? - He cared enough to help us.
the medication. Do you have a sample?
is that my... bellini's medication?
just... tell me what you're doing.
please just tell me what you're doing to me.
we know all about your disease, Claire.
we know that this... makes you better.
but this...
this will make you special.
I'm so tired.
what is this?
when I told you there were unusual circumstances surrounding Emily's death, these were the circumstances.
I don't understand.
we know how it worked, Dr. Patel.
Ken Williams told us everything.
what we don't know is who else was involved.
I'm not responsible for this, not this.
all I do is give them updates.
who's they? Who's they?
Intrepus - the drug company?
you should just walk away. You have no idea who you're dealing with, - what they're capable of. - Need a name, Dr. Patel.
Dr. Patel?
Dr. Patel. Drop it!
I swear, it was only supposed to be updates. - Dr. Patel, put the gun on the ground now.
I'm a doctor, a healer. Do you want a name?
No!
I found him.
he heads up Intrepus pharmaceutical research division.
by all accounts, he's solely responsible for a guns blazing congressional lobbying campaign that allowed Intrepus to dig into some of their more controversial R&D.
define controversial.
prenatal gene therapy.
human-animal hybridization studies.
viral warfare.
all the fun stuff.
he's in Manhattan today. He's speaking on a humanitarian aide forum.
listen, Liv.
even if the doctor was right, even if Esterbrook had something to do with what happened to those women,
I'm gonna go out on a limb. I'm gonna say he's not gonna confess.
I want to see it in his eyes, Charlie. I need to know it's him.
Mr. Esterbrook?
sorry to interrupt. Amanda Bennet, baxil.
listen, with the risk of sounding sycophantic, I've followed your work since Yale.
three degrees, including a phd in medicinal neurobiology.
I couldn't even get through biochem without cheating off my roommate.
I'm sorry. This must sound insanely naive to you.
no, hardly.
science and technology has reached a point where our means are finally catching up with our imaginations, and the only thing preventing us from doing truly visionary work are these moral-based restrictions that lawmakers put up in the name of public policy.
that and money. We always need more money.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, Amanda.
it isn't about the money.
it is about the resolve.
I haven't been entirely honest with you.
I don't work for baxil, but I know a colleague of yours.
how is Nadim these days? - These days? Dead.
I'm sorry to hear that.
not as sorry as I was to watch it happen.
identify theft is a federal crime, Amanda.
so is kidnapping and murder. And it's agent Dunham.
tell me, what did you hope to get out of this conversation?
I already got it.
how old are you? 28? 29?
you're an attractive young woman. I'm sure you want to start a family one day.
it would be a shame if anything got in your way.
Broyles. When?
H...
I understand you paid a little visit to David Esterbrook.
news travels fast. I was just about to type up the report
in public in a hotel bar.
I didn't realize my interview techniques were under such close scrutiny.
everything we do is under close scrutiny.
this task force that you're now part of, at best it'S... controversial.
we need to be perfect.
trying to intimidate such a high-profile suspect in a murder investigation is reckless at best.
Claire Williams is a prisoner right now, having god know what injected into her body.
and David Esterbrook knows where she is.
he's guilty, and he just assumes he'll get away with it.
so excuse me, but right now, I couldn't give a damn about politics.
which is exactly your problem, and now mine.
you think you're the only one who wants to find Claire Williams?
you violated the cardinal law of our profession.
you let your feelings drive your decision making.
and as a result, you've endangered not only Claire Williams' life but everything we're trying to do here.
if I trust you to control your own passion, Dunham, then I can't trust you.
is that clear?
you'll have my report on the Esterbrook interview within the hour.
I'll be waiting.
is there anything else you'd like me to run past you?
not anything. Everything.
how's it going?
she's almost ready.
and the capsules in her blood stream. They can be triggered remotely?
everything's as requested.
she'll be stable and ready for transport by morning.
I'll call the client and schedule delivery. You're remarkable.
what's happening to me?
Hey, how's it going?
it's great.
Esterbrook's our only lead to where they're holding Claire Williams, and I can't get to him.
I mean, the guy's cleaner than snow.
not even as much as an unpaid parking ticket.
well, I think we actually might be making some progress.
couple minutes ago, Walter thought he might have isolated the compound that's in Emily Kramer's blood, but then he got distracted by the unicorn running through the lab.
funny.
anything else? Got any more jokes?
all right, something's been bugging you all day.
something other than Claire Williams. And that's okay. You know what?
we're all allowed to have our bad days.
what's not fine is blaming it on me.
I want to find her just as much as you do.
you're right. I'm sorry. I...
I'm sorry.
fine. I had a stepfather.
and when he drank, he'd accuse my mom of seeing other men, and then he'd hit her.
and she just lived with it.
she never called the police, not once.
then one day he beat her really bad and broke her nose.
I was nine.
stormed out of the house, got in his car, drove off.
my mom's crying and I can't help her.
and then I hear his car.
he's turned back around.
he kept a gun in the drawer near his bed.
when he opened the door, I pulled the trigger.
then I pulled it again.
and I can still see his face almost daring me to finish.
but I couldn'T.
so...
they took him to the hospital and said that he couldn't be saved, but he didn't die.
he recovered. Then one night, he just slipped away.
we never saw him again.
and I still blame myself, because I should've done it. I should've killed him.
and I know that rationally he is not responsible for all the bad things in the world, but he is responsible for some of them.
and every year he sends me a card on my birthday just to let me know...
that he's still out there.
it's your birthday today.
no man is untouchable, Olivia.
if you really want Esterbrook, all you have to do is talk to your friend Nina Sharp.
massive dynamic has three separate pharmaceutical divisions.
they're in direct competition with Intrepus.
their annual budget for corporate espionage could feed a mid-size nation.
I guarantee you she has something on David Esterbrook.
Yeah, but even if you're right, I can't go to her.
why not?
because despite their annual budget, corporate espionage is wildly illegal.
you really think that she'd admit that to me?
it's here somewhere. I know it is.
I just have to look harder.
I'm going out. - Okay.
Oh, Peter!
to be honest, I didn't even know you were here.
thank you.
excuse me. Ms. Sharp.
Hi, I'm Peter
Peter bishop. Walter bishop's son.
you're not the only one who's done their homework.
what can I do for you, Mr. Bishop?
well, I was hoping I could take a moment of your time.
does Ms. Dunham know you're here?
no, no, she doesn't know I'm here.
well, Peter, suppose we take a walk.
you're suggesting that Intrepus is conducting illegal drug trials with human beings.
that is a rather bold claim to make, Mr. Bishop.
how are you able to substantiate your information?
would you put it past them?
let's assume for a second that what I'm saying is true.
where would they do it?
they wouldn't risk using one of their own testing facilities.
it'd have to be some place off the grid.
you know, you still look just the same as you did when you were a child.
Oh, I doubt you'll remember, but you and I spent a good deal of time together.
some of it right here.
your father and I were quite close when we were both much younger.
now I have all kinds of information, Peter, and some of it does me no good.
well, take the aymara people, for instance, of central Peru.
now I know that the soil beneath their land houses a naturally occurring metal alloy that is potentially hyperconductive.
I also know that you have managed to successfully conduct business with these and other tribal concerns in parts of the world traditionally resistant to development.
I'm sorry, Ms. Sharp. I think I must've missed your question.
my question is, are you willing to make a bargain?
I give you the exact location you want, and in exchange,
I get to come to you someday, and you return the favor.
no questions asked.
so do we have a deal?
do you smell that?
Yes, and next time, how about a little warning?
Oh, not that. Methyleugenol.
the chemical responsible for giving hyacinths their aroma.
what about it?
I have been trying to determine what caused the radioactive capsules in Emily Kramer's bloodstream to burst at once.
this is it, asterisk.
Astrid. Her name is Astrid.
I've got it, Peter. Methyleugenol is the key!
that's what they injected her with.
that's why these women were chosen.
by itself, harmless, but given their treatments
causing all the capsules to burst at once.
they made her radioactive.
they turned her into a weapon.
it will be a decidedly blue compound, and now that I--no...
yes... yes! That's it. A bonding agent.
that will work. That will interfere with the process.
how long? How long will it take to make the cure?
Oh, not long at all now that I know.
Where's Olivia?
when did this happen?
when did this become the world we live in?
patel, Esterbrook. These are the people we trust to take care of us.
5620 Stapleton Avenue.
the facility where Claire Williams is being held.
how could you possibly
radioactive isotopes have a heat signature that's visible to spy satellites.
I had a friend track it down through the National Reconnaissance Office.
you have a friend at the NRO.
I have a friend who's cracked their control systems.
Peter, if I pull the trigger on this and the information's bad
it's good. it's good.
Charlie, I've got a solid lead. A strike team. Full tactical.
how we doing? - Almost there.
no, we're sure. This is the one.
we've got a visible heat signature from the isotopes.
visible heat signature? Radioactive isotopes don't give off
Walter, Walter, stay focused. How we doing?
Oh, uh, um, Olivia, this is the antidote.
okay, Charlie, we're coming now. - Listen to me.
you must inject this directly into her bloodstream.
in the jugular, preferably. - Okay.
facility's locate on the southern edge of Framingham.
surveillance teams reported armed security on the premises.
we're expecting resistance, so this will be a tactical entry.
our main objective is securing the victim, Claire Williams.
judging from the layout, it's likely she's being held at the basement level.
we'll enter through the northwest of the building.
alpha team will enter through the front, clear out the west of the building.
Bravo team will clear the lower levels.
are we clear?
then let's make this happen.
FBI, you're under arrest. Get down now!
hands behind your head. - Room is clear.
I need one, I need one, I need one!
look out! Man down!
we have a man down. We need immediately medevac. Call it in.
stay with him. - Level's secure.
we've got a few in custody. - Any sign of Claire?
no. - I'm going down.
watch yourself.
step away from that, please. Where is she? Where's Claire Williams?
agent Dunham, you can't go in that room. The radiation, it'll kill us all.
Claire, my name's Olivia Dunham. I'm with the FBI.
I know you're scared, but I need you to listen to me.
I need you to come to the door.
I can't come in there.
my head... it hurts. - That's medicine.
I need you to come to the door and take it.
I can't come in there.
Claire, look at me! That's good. Now come to the door.
that's it, good, good. I need you to take the syringe.
I'm gonna tell you what to do.
good. Good, Claire.
Claire! Look at me, Claire!
Claire, I'm right here with you. Claire!
Claire, you need to jab yourself in your jugular on the side of your neck.
Oh, my god. My head!
Claire! Claire! Claire, do it! You can do this.
Claire, just do it. I know you can do it. Stab it in.
agent Dunham.
apparently I didn't make my point clearly enough.
I thought you'd be interested to know that Claire Williams is safe.
can't say I'm familiar with that name.
that's odd.
because an employee of yours, Elizabeth Sarnoff, just admitted that you supplied her with the facility and the equipment to make Emily Kramer and Ms. Williams into human weapons.
a disgruntled former employee will say just about anything to vilify the boss that fired her.
then you won't mind coming with me to answer some questions.
do you honestly see this going anywhere, agent Dunham?
I have a law firm on retainer that charges more by the hour than you make in an entire year.
then I suggest you get them to meet you at the FBI.
I guess I will include police harassment in the litany of charges that I will file against you.
I'm still gonna walk you out that door in handcuffs for resisting questioning.
so the press that I tipped off can splash your picture all over the news.
you may not answer to me or the federal government, but you do answer to a board of directors.
and I wonder what their response will be when they have their company dragged into the middle of a murder investigation.
I guess by now you've heard.
that you frog marched a senior officer of a multibillion dollar conglomerate out of his office?
Yeah, I heard.
quite a few cameras there.
the press.
they always get their pound of flesh.
I understand that you think I acted too emotionally.
and putting aside the fact that men always say that about women they work with,
I'll get straight to the point. I am emotional.
I do bring it into my work.
it's what motivates me.
it helps me to get into the headspace of our victims, see what they've seen.
even if I don't want to. Even if it horrifies me.
and I think it makes me a better agent.
if you have a problem with that, sorry.
you can fire me.
t I hope you don'T.
you're not getting off that easy, agent Dunham.
I'll see you in the morning.
today as the spike in the price of oil again sent tremors through the financial markets, but for pure shock value nothing beats today's very public detainment on intrepus' david esterbrook by the FBI.
Intrepus stock is being absolutely pummeled in overnight trading, and analysts predict it will open at $23 a share.
that's a ten-year low.
which, of course, is very good news for Intrepus' competitors, most notably massive dynamic.
shares of md are up almost 12% as investors flee to the most reliable brand in the sector.
Olivia! Did you lock yourself out again?
actually, Walter, this is our hotel.
I need to talk to you. - Sure.
I'll see you upstairs, okay?
it's nice to see you. - Good night, Walter.
and remember tonight, please, the red toothbrush is mine.
white for Walter. That's me. Right?
Yes.
everything okay?
I know where you got your information.
about Claire Williams.
what was her price?
what did Nina Sharp want in return?
nothing untoward, if thas what you're worried about. - Peter.
you don't have to worry about me. I'm a big boy. I can take care of myself.
you've been looking out for me, so I'm just returning the favor.
thank you.
there was no letter today, was there?
no.
happy birthday.
you better get back upstairs before Walter falls asleep in your bed.
Yeah. He has actually done that before.
while I was sleeping. Really not something you want to wake up to.
good night.
good night.

milford MASSACHUSETTS
Hey, do u need a memu?
U okay?
do u want some food?
there's a wicked good vegetable soup.
Hey, give me a soup.
onion?
no, vegetable. No one like the onion.
and call Marty, would u?
Marty, how come?
there's some woman here who might be in trouble.
she might need some help.
here u go.
thank u.
I used to love these crackers.
when I was kid, my mother would always get pissed at me.
because whenever we went out to eat, i'd always eat like three packs.
before the food came, then I'd be stuffed.
what happened there?
no that it's any of my business.
I'll leave u alone if u like.
I'm trying to remember.
I was at Thurber's.
Hey, Marty.
I'll just have a soda.
how you doing tonight?
you live around here?
I do.
I live in the area.
haven't seen you around.
I know i was born in boston.
Oh, yeah?
you were born there?
so, uh, where do you live now?
Where's home?
I don't remember.
they...
they did things.
who did things?
I-- I don't-- i don't know.
they-- They gave me a red medicine.
yeah?
so, uh, what was the red medicine?
they didn't tell me.
okay, that's all right.
and, um, a blue one.
there was blue.
they-- They confused me.
they...
hurt me, and
ma'am, I think you should come with me.
no.
I can help you.
No!
no, no, no, you're not in any trouble.
no, stop--stop it!
you need to talk to somebody.
stop it!
this is officer Pitts.
I've got a 5150.
can you make sure that Hannah's available tonight, please.
Aah!
Ben.
Unh!
I need an ambulance at the diner right away!
right now!
what the hell is this?
what?
Oh, that doesn't bother you?
are you kidding?
that man falls asleep Counting pi to the 101st digit.
that's soothing.
was i humming?
I thought it was in my head.
it wasn't.
forgive me, Olivia.
nothing sings like a kilovolt.
unique pitch.
nothing else in nature quite like it.
I'm sure you're right.
what's up?
what's on your mind?
short fuse today, I guess.
indeed, the tension in your voice Indicates that you're carrying a heavy psychic burden.
tortured by the depths of some
Hey, Walter, I think she liked it better When you were humming.
the incident occurred approximately six hours ago.
all we've been able to determine so far
is that they were exposed to high levels of radiation.
last night was the first time Anyone had seen her in two weeks
since she was reported missing by her parents.
police officer inside Responded to a psych disturbance,
which would explain why we found her in handcuffs.
you think she was a runway?
her parents say no.
they say she was perfectly happy.
in fact, she'd just been accepted to a masters program she was excited about.
curiously, the level of radiation Coming from emily's body
is almost three times as great as the rest.
are you saying that she was the source?
don't know.
Dr. Bishop, any thoughts?
Yes.
where can i get one of those white suits?
Ohh.
Ah!
Oh, yeah.
there's no head.
she was sick.
most like bellini's lymphocemia.
striped bruising on her neck and upper arms.
you know what he's talking about?
bellini's lymphocemia.
it's an auto-immune disease.
irreversible.
the body destroys its own muscles and organs.
meaning it's fatal.
Yeah.
though I've never seen bellini's cause a victim To lose her head.
and what's more curious, This woman seems to have been in remission.
cured even. The rash appears to be healing, Bruises receding.
?????
how do you cure a disease that's incurable?
I haven't the slightest idea, Though i myself Once cured this one in a dream.
opium.
fantastic stuff.
?????
Ugh!
thanks for the warning.
121 degrees.
that's counter-indicative for a hemorrhagic tumor.

he means the guy's brain was boiled.
like a maine lobster.
I need this body and the headless one Taken back to my lab.
Walter, her disease.
if there's no cure
well, that's the question.
and one which we should pose to whoever was treating her.
which makes three questions.
the other one being, what exactly happened here?
that's only two questions.
Oh, is it?
Oh, the third question!
um, could I get some of this onion soup?
it looks delicious.
agent Dunham?
pleasure to meet you.
thank you, thank you very much for taking the trouble to talk to me.
of course.
I've been told you have news about emily kramer.
unfortunately, I do.
Emily was found dead last night.
what?
how?
I'm not at liberty to discuss that with you.
forgive me.
I'm just...
emotional investment in patients.
it's an occupational hazard.
her poor parents must be devastated after everything they've already been through.
Yes, and I hate troubling you about this,
but we understand that emily was suffering
from a fatal disease that had recently gone into remission.
that's right.
do you have any idea how that's possible?
medically, no.
were you treating her with any sort of radiation therapy?
radiation?
no.
Why?
the-- the circumstances surrounding emily's death Were unusual.
and it's possible that her condition may have been a factor.
I'll get you her records if that'll help.
Yeah.
she was finally starting to live again.
do I really need to be here?
couldn't you just use a clamp?
of course I could.
but I enjoy the company.
quality time, as they say.
yeah,'cause this is just like throwing around the old pigskin.
what's that smell?
hyacinth, my third favorite flower.
associated in mythology with rebirth, which in this case is cruelly ironic.
it's coming from her?
indeed, which indicates either a mutation of the genetic level, or she was eating flowers.
perhaps her perfume.
how's it coming?
Oh, Olivia, join us.
we've learned some things.
we don't think she ran away.
ligature marks.
so she was being held against her will.
either that or she had a proclivity for sexual bondage.
scientific observation, not a judgment.
some of my fondest memories
Oh, Walter stop.
wherever that's going is just wrong.
there's also this.
subcutaneous injection marks.
she was being given medicine intravenously.
so whoever was holding her captive was giving her drugs.
Yes, but not the enjoyable kind.
in fact, quite unlike anything I've ever seen before.
you okay?
should i be?
so how'd she end up in the diner?
did she escape?
perhaps not.
there are two distinct methods in scientific experimentation.
lab trials or field trials.
you're suggesting they may have let her go on purpose?
whoever did this wanted to make sure what they did to her was working.
so there was something inside her that killed those people at the diner.
and her
noggin?
I'm not sure yet.
it's a theory.
obviously I'll be more certain Once we identify the substance.
or when whoever did this... --Hey, charlie.
tries to repeat their results.
you mean if they take another woman.
judging by agent Dunham's body language, I'd say she's receiving that very news.
okay.
missing persons called in another case four hours ago.
her name is Claire Williams.
she was diagnosed with bellini's lymphocemia three years ago.
someone's targeting people with the disease?
that or it's one hell of a coincidence.
Hey, Liv.
I get it.
you get what?
young woman, what was done to her.
you know, this coming your way today of all days.
it's okay.
I'm okay.
listen, I know you don't like to celebrate, but happy birthday.
Claire. Did you find her?
I'm afraid we don't have new information.
but we do need to ask you a few questions.
her name is emily kramer.
she's suffered from the same disease as your wife.
you seen her before?
another case?
what-- what happened to her?
do you know her, Mr. Williams?
no, I- I don't think so.
we don't know anyone else with bellini's I mean, what we went through fighting Claire's disease.
and the constant pain.
when the lesions started appearing, she stopped going out.
that damn disease almost took everything from us,
even our marriage.
and then...
it was like a miracle.
a miracle?
she started getting better.
the pain went away.
she went into remission?
about six weeks ago.
she was herself again.
and now...
please find my wife.
please find her for me.
what's happening?
please don't hurt me.
the last one was a test.
this one counts.
is she a candidate?
even better.
to understand what happened at the diner,
we'll use Mr. Papaya.
clear!
this is upsetting because he's the friendliest of fruits.
and we have goo-ification.
is that the scientific term?
wait.
the show's not over yet.
is that what you think happened to the people in the diner?
that beam emits high energy microwaves
which cause Mr. Papaya's molecules to vibrate rapidly,
causing friction and producing heat.
it's like how a microwave oven cooks food.
only in emily kramer's case, she was the oven.
but then what killed Emily?
this demonstration is far more effective with living tissue.
I have some expendable gerbils in the back.
no.
Oh, it's no trouble.
I'm sure you'd like it.
Walter, just drop it.
wait, am I missing something?
how is it that Emily is, um, cooking people?
in her blood I found traces of radioactive isotopes.
strontium 90.
I believe that these microscopic capsules are designed to release
just the right amount of radiation at specific times to cure her disease.
so you think these capsules saved her life.
think of it like time-released chemotherapy.
Oh, yes, but in Emily's case,
the cure also made her a perfect candidate for weaponization.
whatever was injected into her bloodstream caused these capsules to burst all at once,
sending out a microwave blast.
and perhaps given her own head was the source of energy--kaboom.
so Emily's rheumatologist, Dr. Patel, would he have access to these sorts of isotopes?
it's doubtful.
they only use them in a couple of therapies,
and they're really strictly regulated.
Why?
you think Patel had something to do with this?
I don't know.
but 83% of kidnap victims are abducted by someone they know.
I'm gonna go and talk to Emily Kramer's parents.
I'll come with you.
Oh, Peter!
if you're going out, could you bring me back some cotton candy?
cotton candy.
Yep.
blue, not pink.
I've had a craving.
must be the hyacinths.
lovely blue flowers.
you're probably way ahead of me on this already,
but i'm noticing certain uncomfortable similarities between this and some of the other incidents we've been covering lately.
more humans are being used as guinea pigs.
my points is, if this is part of the pattern,
what if these people aren't just experiments?
what if somebody is preparing for something?
maybe we should come back later.
before or after they do to Claire Williams what they did to Emily Kramer?
Olivia, this is a wake.
these people are mourning their child.
no.
don't you need a warrant for this?
Hey, Olivia, stop!
okay, crashing a wake is bad enough,
but rifling through a dead girl's things?
it's the only hope of finding a solid lead,
so please help me.
what is it that we're looking for?
anything, any connection she may have had -- What are you doing in here?
who are you?
what are you doing in my daughter's room?
Mrs. Kramer, we're terribly sorry about your loss.
we're with the FBI.
today?
you come here today?
Mrs. Kramer, please listen to me.
another girl's life is at stake.
what do you mean?
what other girl?
her name is claire williams.
what's happened to claire?
you know her?
a therapist told her to write through The pain and the alienation that she felt.
it was all she had until the treatments.
the treatments?
for her bellini's.
Emily and Claire both had the disease.
that's how they met.
here.
they became such good friends.
why'd you lie to me, Mr. Williams?
we met emily at the hospital waiting for blood tests.
she and Claire started talking,
sharing horror stories about their disease.
they became friends.
one night over dinner, the conversation turned to how the medical establishment had abandoned us.
see, there's only 3, 000 people in this country who suffer from bellini's.
not enough for the drug companies to make a profit,
so they're not looking into developing a cure.
and we started talking to some other people we met Who also had the disease.
a microbiologist, an investment banker,
the mother of a professional athlete.
started thinking about what we could do If we pooled our resources.
so Claire and Emily were treating themselves.
we didn't have a choice.
we were desperate.
we tried radical therapies normal doctors wouldn't touch.
three months ago we found a cure.
time-released radioactive capsules.
Yeah.
I don't understand.
why lie?
because the people we love are depending on it.
I couldn't take the chance you'd stop that.
Claire wouldn't want that.
it's what gave us our lives back.
Mr. Williams, we will need the names of the other patients involved.
I could give you some, but I don't know all of them.
you'll have to ask Dr. Nadim Patel.
Emily's doctor.
he knew this was going on?
he cared enough to help us.
the medication.
do you have a sample?
is that my...
bellini's medication?
tell me what you're doing.
please just tell me what you're doing to me.
we know all about your disease, Claire.
we know that this...
makes you better.
but this...
this will make you special.
I'm so tired.
what is this?
when I told you there were unusual circumstances surrounding Emily's death,
these were the circumstances.
I don't understand.
we know how it worked, Dr. Patel.
Ken Williams told us everything.
what we don't know is who else was involved.
I'm not responsible for this, not this.
all I do is give them updates.
who's they?
who's they?
INTREPUS.
the drug company?
you should just walk away.
you have no idea who you're dealing with,
what they're capable of.
I need a name, Dr. Patel.
Dr. Patel?
Dr. Patel.
drop it!
I swear, it was only supposed to be updates.
Dr. Patel, put the gun on the ground now. --I'm a doctor, a healer.
do you want a name?
No!
I found him.
he heads up intrepus pharmaceutical research division.
by all accounts, he's solely responsible for a guns blazing congressional lobbying campaign
that allowed Intrepus to dig into some of their more controversial r&d.
define controversial.
prenatal gene therapy.
human-animal hybridization studies.
viral warfare.
all the fun stuff.
he's in manhattan today.
he's speaking on a humanitarian aide forum.
listen, Liv.
even if the doctor was right,
even if esterbrook had something to do with what happened to those women,
I'm gonna go out on a limb.
I'm gonna say he's not gonna confess.
I want to see it in his eyes, Charlie.
I need to know it's him.
Mr. Esterbrook?
sorry to interrupt.
listen, with the risk of sounding sycophantic,
I've followed your work since yale.
three degrees, including a phd in medicinal neurobiology.
I couldn't even get through biochem without cheating off my roommate.
I'm sorry.
this must sound insanely naive to you.
no, hardly.
science and technology has reached a point
where our means are finally catching up With our imaginations,
and the only thing preventing us from doing truly visionary work
are these moral-based restrictions
that lawmakers put up in the name of public policy.
that and money.
we always need more money.
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, Amanda.
it isn't about the money.
it is about the resolve.
I haven't been entirely honest with you.
I don't work for Baxil,
but i know a colleague of yours.
Dr. Nadim Patel.
how is Nadim these days?
these days?
dead.
I'm sorry to hear that.
not as sorry as I was to watch it happen.
identify theft is a federal crime, Amanda.
so is kidnapping and murder.
and it's agent Dunham.
tell me, what did you hope to get out of this conversation?
I already got it.
how old are you?
you're an attractive young woman.
I'm sure you want to start a family one day.
it would be a shame if anything got in your way.
when?
Hey.
I understand you paid a little visit to David Esterbrook.
news travels fast.
I was just about to type up the report-- In public in a hotel bar.
I didn't realize my interview techniques were under such close scrutiny.
everything we do is under close scrutiny.
this task force that you're now part of, at best it's...
controversial.
we need to be perfect.
trying to intimidate such a high-profile suspect
in a murder investigation is reckless at best.
Claire williams is a prisoner right now,
having god know what injected into her body.
and David Esterbrook knows where she is.
he's guilty, and he just assumes he'll get away with it.
so excuse me, but right now,
I couldn't give a damn about politics.
which is exactly your problem, and now mine.
you think you're the only one who wants to find claire williams?
you violated the cardinal law of our profession.
you let your feelings drive your decision making.
and as a result, you've endangered not only Claire Williams' life
but everything we're trying to do here.
if I trust you to control your own passion, Dunham,
then i can't trust you.
is that clear?
you'll have my report on the Esterbrook interview within the hour.
I'll be waiting.
is there anything else you'd like me to run past you?
not anything.
everything.
how's it going?
she's almost ready.
and the capsules in her blood stream.
they can be triggered remotely?
everything's as requested.
she'll be stable and ready for transport by morning.
I'll call the client and schedule delivery.
well done.
what's happening to me?
Hey, how's it going?
it's great.
Esterbrook's our only lead to where they're holding Claire Williams,
and I can't get to him.
I mean, the guy's cleaner than snow.
not even as much as an unpaid parking ticket.
well, I think we actually might be making some progress.
couple minutes ago, Walter thought he might have isolated the compound that's in Emily Kramer's blood,
but then he got distracted by the unicorn running through the lab.
funny.
anything else?
got any more jokes?
all right, something's been bugging you all day.
something other than Claire Williams.
and that's okay.
you know what?
we're all allowed to have our bad days.
what's not fine is blaming it on me.
I want to find her just as much as you do.
you're right.
I'm sorry.
I...
I'm sorry.
fine.
I had a stepfather.
and when he drank, he'd accuse my mom of seeing other men, and then he'd hit her.
and she just lived with it.
she never called the police, not once.
then one day he beat her really bad and broke her nose.
I was nine.
stormed out of the house, got in his car, drove off.
my mom's crying and I can't help her.
and then I hear his car.
he's turned back around.
he kept a gun in the drawer near his bed.
when he opened the door, I pulled the trigger.
then I pulled it again.
and I can still see his face almost daring me to finish.
but I couldn't.
so...
they took him to the hospital and said that he couldn't be saved, but he didn't die.
he recovered.
then one night, he just slipped away.
we never saw him again.
and I still blame myself, because I should've done it.
I should've killed him.
and I know that rationally he is not responsible for all the bad things in the world,
but he is responsible for some of them.
and every year he sends me a card on my birthday just to let me know...
that he's still out there.
it's your birthday today.
no man is untouchable, Olivia.
if you really want Esterbrook, all you have to do is talk to your friend Nina Sharp.
massive dynamic has three separate pharmaceutical divisions.
they're in direct competition with intrepus.
their annual budget for corporate espionage could feed a mid-size nation.
I guarantee you she has something on David Esterbrook.
Yeah, but even if you're right, I can't go to her.
why not?
because despite their annual budget,
corporate espionage is wildly illegal.
you really think that she'd admit that to me?
it's here somewhere.
I know it is.
I just have to look harder.
I'm going out.
okay.
to be honest, I didn't even know you were here.
excuse me.
ms. Sharp.
Hi, I'm Peter
Peter bishop. Walter bishop's son.
you're not the only one who's done their homework.
what can I do for you, mr. Bishop?
well, I was hoping I could take a moment of your time.
does Ms. Dunham know you're here?
no, no, she doesn't know I'm here.
well, Peter, Suppose we take a walk.
you're suggesting that intrepus is conducting illegal drug trials with human beings.
that is a rather bold claim to make, Mr. Bishop.
how are you able to substantiate your information?
would you put it past them?
let's assume for a second that what I'm saying is true.
where would they do it?
they wouldn't risk using one of their own testing facilities.
it'd have to be some place off the grid.
you know, you still look just the same as you did when you were a child.
Oh, I doubt you'll remember,
but you and I spent a good deal of time together.
some of it right here.
your father and I were quite close when we were both much younger.
now I have all kinds of information, Peter, and some of it does me no good.
well, take the Aymara people, for instance, of central Peru.
now I know that the soil beneath their land houses a naturally occurring metal alloy
that is potentially hyperconductive.
I also know that you have managed to successfully conduct business with these
and other tribal concerns in parts of the world traditionally resistant to development.
I'm sorry, Ms. Sharp.
I think I must've missed your question.
my question is, are you willing to make a bargain?
I give you the exact location you want, and in exchange, I get to come to you someday, and you return the favor.
no questions asked.
so do we have a deal?
do you smell that?
Yes, and next time, how about a little warning?
huh?
Oh, not that.
Methyleugenol.
the chemical responsible for giving hyacinths their aroma.
what about it?
I have been trying to determine what caused the radioactive capsules
in Emily Kramer's bloodstream to burst at once.
this is it, asterisk.
her name is Astrid.
I've got it, Peter.
METHYLEUGENOL is the key!
that's what they injected her with.
that's why these women were chosen.
by itself, harmless, but given their treatments -- Causing all the capsules to burst at once.
they made her radioactive.
they turned her into a weapon.
it will be a decidedly blue compound, and now that I-- No...
yes...
Yes!
that's it.
a bonding agent.
that will work.
that will interfere with the process.
how long?
how long will it take to make the cure?
Oh, not long at all now that i know.
Where's Olivia?
when did this happen?
when did this become the world we live in?
these are the people we trust to take care of us.
5620 Stapleton avenue.
the facility where Claire Williams is being held.
how could you possibly
radioactive isotopes have a heat signature
that's visible to spy satellites.
I had a friend track it down through the national reconnaissance office.
you have a friend at the nro.
I have a friend who's cracked their control systems.
Peter, if I pull the trigger on this and the information's bad
it's good.
it's good.
Charlie, I've got a solid lead.
a strike team.
full tactical.
how we doing?
almost there.
no, we're sure.
this is the one.
we've got a visible heat signature from the isotopes.
visible heat signature?
radioactive isotopes don't give off
Walter, Walter, How we doing?
Oh, uh, um, olivia, this is the antidote.
okay, Charlie, we're coming now.
listen to me.
you must inject this directly into her bloodstream.
in the jugular, preferably.
okay.
facility's located on the southern edge of Framingham.
surveillance teams reported armed security on the premises.
we're expecting resistance, so this will be a tactical entry.
our main objective is securing the victim, Claire Williams.
judging from the layout, it's likely she's being held at the basement level.
we'll enter through the northwest of the building.
alpha team will enter through the front, clear out the west of the building.
Bravo team will clear the lower levels.
then let's make this happen.
FBI, you're under arrest.
get down now!
hands behind your head.
room is clear.
I need one, I need one, I need one!
look out!
man down!
we have a man down.
we need immediately medevac.
call it in.
stay with him.
level's secure.
we've got a few in custody.
any sign of Claire?
no.
I'm going down.
watch yourself.
step away from that, please.
where is she?
Where's Claire Williams?
agent Dunham, you can't go in that room.
the radiation, it'll kill us all.
Claire, my name's Olivia Dunham.
I'm with the FBI.
I know you're scared, but I need you to listen to me.
I need you to come to the door.
I can't come in there.
my head...
it hurts.
that's medicine.
I need you to come to the door and take it.
I can't come in there.
Claire, look at me!
that's good.
now come to the door.
keep coming.
I need you to take the syringe.
I'm gonna tell you what to do.
good.
good, Claire.
look at me, Claire!
Claire, I'm right here with you.
Claire, you need to jab yourself in your jugular on the side of your neck.
Oh, my god.
my head!
Claire! come on.
Claire, do it!
you can do this.
Claire, just do it.
I know you can do it.
stab it in.
agent Dunham.
apparently I didn't make my point clearly enough.
I thought you'd be interested to know that Claire Williams is safe.
can't say I'm familiar with that name.
that's odd.
because an employee of yours, Elizabeth Sarnoff,
just admitted that you supplied her with the facility and the equipment
to make Emily Kramer and Ms. Williams into human weapons.
a disgruntled former employee will say just about anything to vilify the boss that fired her.
then you won't mind coming with me to answer some questions.
do you honestly see this going anywhere, agent Dunham?
I have a law firm on retainer that charges more by the hour than you make in an entire year.
then I suggest you get them to meet you at the fbi.
I guess i will include police harassment in the litany of charges that I will file against you.
I'm still gonna walk you out that door in handcuffs for resisting questioning.
so the press that i tipped off can splash your picture all over the news.
you may not answer to me or the federal government, but you do answer to a board of directors.
and I wonder what their response will be
when they have their company dragged Into the middle of a murder investigation.
I guess by now you've heard.
that you frog marched a senior officer
of a multibillion dollar conglomerate out of his office?
Yeah, I heard.
quite a few cameras there.
the press.
they always get their pound of flesh.
I understand that you think I acted too emotionally.
and putting aside the fact that men always say that about women they work with,
I'll get straight to the point.
I am emotional.
I do bring it into my work.
it's what motivates me.
it helps me to get into the headspace of our victims,
see what they've seen.
even if I don't want to.
even if it horrifies me.
and I think it makes me a better agent.
if you have a problem with that, sorry.
you can fire me.
but i hope you don't.
you're not getting off that easy, agent Dunham.
I'll see you in the morning.
today as the spike in the price of oil again sent tremors through the financial markets,
but for pure shock value nothing beats today's very public detainment
on Intrepus' David esterbrook by the FBI.
Intrepus stock is being absolutely pummeled In overnight trading,
and analysts predict it will open at $23 a share.
that's a ten-year low.
which, of course, is very good news for Intrepus' competitors,
most notably massive dynamic.
shares of md are up almost 12% as investors flee to the most reliable brand in the sector.
Hey.
did you lock yourself out again?
actually, Walter, this is our hotel.
Oh.
I need to talk to you.
sure.
I'll see you upstairs, okay?
it's nice to see you.
good night, Walter.
and remember tonight, please, the red toothbrush is mine.
white for Walter.
that's me.
right?
Yes.
everything okay?
I know where you got your information.
about Claire Williams.
what was her price?
what did Nina Sharp want in return?
nothing untoward, if that's what you're worried about.
you don't have to worry about me.
I'm a big boy.
I can take care of myself.
you've been looking out for me, so I'm just returning the favor.
thank you.
there was no letter today, was there?
no.
happy birthday.
you better get back upstairs before Walter falls asleep in your bed.
Yeah.
he has actually done that before.
while I was sleeping.
really not something you want to wake up to.
good night.
good night.
Hey, DO YOU NEED A MENU?
you OKAY?
do YOU WANT SOME FOOD?
there's A WICKED GOOD VEGETABLE SOUP.
Hey, GIVE ME A SOUP. ONION?
no, VEGETABLE. NO ONE LIKES THE ONION.
and CALL MARTY, WOULD YOU?
Marty? HOW COME?
there's SOME WOMAN HERE WHO MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE.
she MIGHT NEED SOME HELP.
here YOU GO.
thank YOU.
I USED TO LOVE THOSE CRACKERS.
when I WAS KID, MY MOM WOULD ALWAYS GET PISSED AT ME BECAUSE WHENEVER WE WENT OUT TO EAT, I'D ALWAYS EAT LIKE THREE PACKS BEFORE THE FOOD CAME, AND THEN I'D BE STUFFED.
what HAPPENED THERE?
not THAT IT'S ANY OF MY BUSINESS.
I'll LEAVE YOU ALONE IF YOU LIKE.
I'm TRYING TO REMEMBER.
I WAS AT THURBER'S.
Hey, MARTY.
I'll JUST HAVE A SODA.
how YOU DOING TONIGHT?
you LIVE AROUND HERE?
I DO. I LIVE IN THE AREA.
haven't SEEN YOU AROUND.
I KNOW I WAS BORN IN BOSTON.
Oh, YEAH? YOU WERE BORN THERE?
so, UH, WHERE DO YOU LIVE NOW?
Where's HOME?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
they...they DID THINGS.
who DID THINGS?
I I DON'T-I DON'T KNOW.
they THEY GAVE ME A RED MEDICINE.
yeah?
so, UH, WHAT WAS THE RED MEDICINE?
they DIDN'T TELL ME.
okay, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
and, UM, A BLUE ONE.
there WAS BLUE.
they
they CONFUSED ME.
they... HURT ME, AND
ma'am, I THINK YOU SHOULD COME WITH ME.
no. I CAN HELP YOU.
No! NO, NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT IN ANY TROUBLE.
no, STOP-STOP IT!
you NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.
stop IT!
this IS OFFICER PITTS. I'VE GOT A 5150.
can YOU MAKE SURE THAT HANNAH'S AVAILABLE TONIGHT, PLEASE.
I NEED AN AMBULANCE AT THE DINER RIGHT AWAY!

are YOU KIDDING?

that's SOOTHING.

it WASN'T.

you THINK SHE WAS A RUNWAY?
her PARENTS SAY NO.
they SAY SHE WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY.
in FACT, SHE'D JUST BEEN ACCEPTED TO A MASTERS PROGRAM SHE WAS EXCITED ABOUT.
curiously, THE LEVEL OF RADIATION COMING FROM EMILY'S BODY IS ALMOST THREE TIMES AS GREAT AS THE REST.
are YOU SAYING THAT SHE WAS THE SOURCE?
don't KNOW.
Dr. BISHOP, ANY THOUGHTS?
Yes.
where CAN I GET ONE OF THOSE WHITE SUITS?
there's NO HEAD.
she WAS SICK.
most LIKE BELLINI'S LYMPHOCEMIA.
striped BRUISING ON HER NECK AND UPPER ARMS.
you KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT?
bellini's LYMPHOCEMIA. IT'S AN AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE.
irreversible.
the BODY DESTROYS ITS OWN MUSCLES AND ORGANS.
meaning IT'S FATAL. YEAH.
though I'VE NEVER SEEN BELLINI'S CAUSE A VICTIM TO LOSE HER HEAD.
and WHAT'S MORE CURIOUS, THIS WOMAN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN IN REMISSION.
cured EVEN.
the RASH APPEARS TO BE HEALING.
bruises RECEDING.
???
how DO YOU CURE A DISEASE THAT'S INCURABLE?
I HAVEN'T THE SLIGHTEST IDEA, ??? THOUGH I MYSELF ONCE CURED THIS ONE IN A DREAM.
opium. FANTASTIC STUFF.
???
Ugh! THANKS FOR THE WARNING.
121 DEGREES.
that's COUNTER-INDICATIVE FOR A HEMORRHAGIC TUMOR.
most LIKELY WATER MOLECULES EXCITED ALL AT ONCE.
he MEANS THE GUY'S BRAIN WAS BOILED.
like A MAINE LOBSTER.
I NEED THIS BODY AND THE HEADLESS ONE TAKEN BACK TO MY LAB.
Walter, HER DISEASE. IF THERE'S NO CURE
well, THAT'S THE QUESTION.
and ONE WHICH WE SHOULD POSE TO WHOEVER WAS TREATING HER.
which MAKES THREE QUESTIONS.
the OTHER ONE BEING, WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED HERE?
that's ONLY TWO QUESTIONS.
Oh, IS IT? OH, THE THIRD QUESTION!
um, COULD I GET SOME OF THIS ONION SOUP?
it LOOKS DELICIOUS.
agent DUNHAM?
Nadim PATEL. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
thank YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TROUBLE TO TALK TO ME.
of COURSE.
I've BEEN TOLD YOU HAVE NEWS ABOUT EMILY KRAMER.
unfortunately, I DO.
Emily WAS FOUND DEAD LAST NIGHT.
what? HOW?
I'm NOT AT LIBERTY TO DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU.
forgive ME. I'M JUST...
emotional INVESTMENT IN PATIENTS.
it's AN OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD.
her POOR PARENTS MUST BE DEVASTATED AFTER EVERYTHING THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH.
Yes, AND I HATE TROUBLING YOU ABOUT THIS,
but WE UNDERSTAND THAT EMILY WAS SUFFERING FROM A FATAL DISEASE THAT HAD RECENTLY GONE INTO REMISSION.
that's RIGHT.
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE?
medically, NO.
were YOU TREATING HER WITH ANY SORT OF RADIATION THERAPY?
radiation? NO. WHY?
the-the CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING EMILY'S DEATH WERE UNUSUAL.
and IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HER CONDITION MAY HAVE BEEN A FACTOR.
I'll GET YOU HER RECORDS IF THAT'LL HELP.
Yeah.
she WAS FINALLY STARTING TO LIVE AGAIN.
do I REALLY NEED TO BE HERE?
couldn't YOU JUST USE A CLAMP?
of COURSE I COULD.
but I ENJOY THE COMPANY.
quality TIME, AS THEY SAY.
Yeah, 'CAUSE THIS IS JUST LIKE THROWING AROUND THE OLD PIGSKIN.
what's THAT SMELL?
hyacinth, MY THIRD FAVORITE FLOWER.
associated IN MYTHOLOGY WITH REBIRTH, WHICH IN THIS CASE IS CRUELLY IRONIC.
it's COMING FROM HER?
indeed, WHICH INDICATES EITHER A MUTATION OF THE GENETIC LEVEL, OR SHE WAS EATING FLOWERS.
perhaps HER PERFUME.
how's IT COMING?
Oh, OLIVIA, JOIN US.
we've LEARNED SOME THINGS.
we DON'T THINK SHE RAN AWAY.
ligature MARKS.
so SHE WAS BEING HELD AGAINST HER WILL.
either THAT OR SHE HAD A PROCLIVITY FOR SEXUAL BONDAGE.
scientific OBSERVATION, NOT A JUDGMENT.
some OF MY FONDEST MEMORIES
Oh, WALTER STOP.
wherever THAT'S GOING IS JUST WRONG.
there's ALSO THIS.
subcutaneous INJECTION MARKS.
she WAS BEING GIVEN MEDICINE INTRAVENOUSLY.
so WHOEVER WAS HOLDING HER CAPTIVE WAS GIVING HER DRUGS.
Yes, BUT NOT THE ENJOYABLE KIND.
in FACT, QUITE UNLIKE ANYTHING I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE.
you OKAY?
should I BE?
so HOW'D SHE END UP IN THE DINER?
did SHE ESCAPE? PERHAPS NOT.
there ARE TWO DISTINCT METHODS IN SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTATION.
lab TRIALS OR FIELD TRIALS.
you're SUGGESTING THEY MAY HAVE LET HER GO ON PURPOSE?
whoever DID THIS WANTED TO MAKE SURE WHAT THEY DID TO HER WAS WORKING.
so THERE WAS SOMETHING INSIDE HER THAT KILLED THOSE PEOPLE AT THE DINER.
and HER- NOGGIN?
I'm NOT SURE YET.
it's A THEORY.
obviously I'LL BE MORE CERTAIN ONCE WE IDENTIFY THE SUBSTANCE. SORRY.
or WHEN WHOEVER DID THIS... HEY, CHARLIE.
tries TO REPEAT THEIR RESULTS.
you MEAN IF THEY TAKE ANOTHER WOMAN.
judging BY AGENT DUNHAM'S BODY LANGUAGE, I'D SAY SHE'S RECEIVING THAT VERY NEWS.
okay.
missing PERSONS CALLED IN ANOTHER CASE FOUR HOURS AGO.
her NAME IS CLAIRE WILLIAMS.
she WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BELLINI'S LYMPHOCEMIA THREE YEARS AGO.
someone's TARGETING PEOPLE WITH THE DISEASE?
that OR IT'S ONE HELL OF A COINCIDENCE.
Hey, LIV.
I GET IT.
you GET WHAT?
young WOMAN, WHAT WAS DONE TO HER.
you KNOW, THIS COMING YOUR WAY TODAY OF ALL DAYS.
it's OKAY.
I'm OKAY.
listen, I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TO CELEBRATE,
but HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
Claire. DID YOU FIND HER?
I'm AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE NEW INFORMATION.
but WE DO NEED TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS.
her NAME IS EMILY KRAMER.
she's SUFFERED FROM THE SAME DISEASE AS YOUR WIFE.
you SEEN HER BEFORE?
another CASE?
what-what HAPPENED TO HER?
do YOU KNOW HER, MR. WILLIAMS?
no, I-I DON'T THINK SO.
we DON'T KNOW ANYONE ELSE WITH BELLINI'S
I MEAN, WHAT WE WENT THROUGH FIGHTING CLAIRE'S DISEASE.
and THE CONSTANT PAIN.
when THE LESIONS STARTED APPEARING, SHE STOPPED GOING OUT.
that DAMN DISEASE ALMOST TOOK EVERYTHING FROM US, EVEN OUR MARRIAGE.
and THEN... IT WAS LIKE A MIRACLE.
a MIRACLE?
she STARTED GETTING BETTER.
the PAIN WENT AWAY.
she WENT INTO REMISSION?
about SIX WEEKS AGO.
she WAS HERSELF AGAIN.
and NOW...
please FIND MY WIFE.
please FIND HER FOR ME.
what's HAPPENING?
please DON'T HURT ME.
the LAST ONE WAS A TEST. THIS ONE COUNTS.
is SHE A CANDIDATE?
even BETTER.
???
to UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED AT THE DINER, WE'LL USE MR. PAPAYA.
clear!
this IS UPSETTINGBECAUSE HE'S THE FRIENDLIEST OF FRUITS.
and WE HAVE GOO-IFICATION.
is THAT THE SCIENTIFIC TERM?
wait.
the SHOW'S NOT OVER YET.
is THAT WHAT YOU THINK HAPPENED TO THE PEOPLE IN THE DINER?
that BEAM EMITS HIGH ENERGY MICROWAVES WHICH CAUSE MR. PAPAYA'S MOLECULES TO VIBRATE RAPIDLY, CAUSING FRICTION AND PRODUCING HEAT.
it's LIKE HOW A MICROWAVE OVEN COOKS FOOD.
only IN EMILY KRAMER'S CASE, SHE WAS THE OVEN.
but THEN WHAT KILLED EMILY?
this DEMONSTRATION IS FAR MORE EFFECTIVE WITH LIVING TISSUE.
I HAVE SOME EXPENDABLE GERBILS IN THE BACK. NO.
Oh, IT'S NO TROUBLE. I'M SURE YOU'D LIKE IT.
Walter, JUST DROP IT.
wait, AM I MISSING SOMETHING?
how IS IT THAT EMILY IS, UM, COOKING PEOPLE?
in HER BLOOD I FOUND TRACES OF RADIOACTIVE ISOTOPES.
strontium 90.
I BELIEVE THAT THESE MICROSCOPIC CAPSULES ARE DESIGNED TO RELEASE JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF RADIATION AT SPECIFIC TIMES TO CURE HER DISEASE.
so YOU THINK THESE CAPSULES SAVED HER LIFE.
think OF IT LIKE TIME-RELEASED CHEMOTHERAPY.
Oh, YES, BUT IN EMILY'S CASE,
the CURE ALSO MADE HER A PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR WEAPONIZATION.
whatever WAS INJECTED INTO HER BLOODSTREAM CAUSED THESE CAPSULES TO BURST ALL AT ONCE, SENDING OUT A MICROWAVE BLAST.
and PERHAPS GIVEN HER OWN HEAD WAS THE SOURCE OF ENERGY-KABOOM.
so EMILY'S RHEUMATOLOGIST, DR. PATEL, WOULD HE HAVE ACCESS TO THESE SORTS OF ISOTOPES?
it's DOUBTFUL.
they ONLY USE THEM IN A COUPLE OF THERAPIES, AND THEY'RE REALLY STRICTLY REGULATED.
Why?
you THINK PATEL HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS?
I DON'T KNOW.
but 83% OF KIDNAP VICTIMS ARE ABDUCTED BY SOMEONE THEY KNOW.
I'm GONNA GO AND TALK TO EMILY KRAMER'S PARENTS.
I'll COME WITH YOU.
Oh, PETER!
if YOU'RE GOING OUT, COULD YOU BRING ME BACK SOME COTTON CANDY?
cotton CANDY. YEP.
blue, NOT PINK.
I've HAD A CRAVING.
must BE THE HYACINTHS.
lovely BLUE FLOWERS.
you're PROBABLY WAY AHEAD OF ME ON THIS ALREADY, BUT I'M NOTICING CERTAIN UNCOMFORTABLE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THIS AND SOME OF THE OTHER INCIDENTS WE'VE BEEN COVERING LATELY.
more HUMANS ARE BEING USED AS GUINEA PIGS.
my POINTS IS, IF THIS IS PART OF THE PATTERN,
what IF THESE PEOPLE AREN'T JUST EXPERIMENTS?
what IF SOMEBODY IS PREPARING FOR SOMETHING?
maybe WE SHOULD COME BACK LATER.
before OR AFTER THEY DO TO CLAIRE WILLIAMS WHAT THEY DID TO EMILY KRAMER?
Olivia, THIS IS A WAKE.
these PEOPLE ARE MOURNING THEIR CHILD.
no.
don't YOU NEED A WARRANT FOR THIS?
Hey, OLIVIA, STOP!
okay, CRASHING A WAKE IS BAD ENOUGH, BUT RIFLING THROUGH A DEAD GIRL'S THINGS?
it's THE ONLY HOPE OF FINDING A SOLID LEAD, SO PLEASE HELP ME.
what IS IT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR?
anything, ANY CONNECTION SHE MAY HAVE HAD
what ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?
who ARE YOU?
what ARE YOU DOING IN MY DAUGHTER'S ROOM?
Mrs. KRAMER, WE'RE TERRIBLY SORRY ABOUT YOUR LOSS.
we're WITH THE FBI.
FBI? TODAY? YOU COME HERE TODAY?
Mrs. KRAMER, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME.
another GIRL'S LIFE IS AT STAKE.
what DO YOU MEAN? WHAT OTHER GIRL?
her NAME IS CLAIRE WILLIAMS. CLAIRE?
what's HAPPENED TO CLAIRE?
you KNOW HER?
a THERAPIST TOLD HER TO WRITE THROUGH THE PAIN AND THE ALIENATION THAT SHE FELT.
it WAS ALL SHE HAD UNTIL THE TREATMENTS.
the TREATMENTS? FOR HER BELLINI'S.
Emily AND CLAIRE BOTH HAD THE DISEASE.
that's HOW THEY MET. HERE.
they BECAME SUCH GOOD FRIENDS.
why'd YOU LIE TO ME, MR. WILLIAMS?
we MET EMILY AT THE HOSPITALWAITING FOR BLOOD TESTS.
she AND CLAIRE STARTED TALKING, SHARING HORROR STORIES ABOUT THEIR DISEASE.
they BECAME FRIENDS.
one NIGHT OVER DINNER, THE CONVERSATION TURNED TO HOW THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT HAD ABANDONED US.
see, THERE'S ONLY 3, 000 PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO SUFFER FROM BELLINI'S.
not ENOUGH FOR THE DRUG COMPANIES TO MAKE A PROFIT, SO THEY'RE NOT LOOKING INTO DEVELOPING A CURE.
and WE STARTED TALKING TO SOME OTHER PEOPLE WE MET WHO ALSO HAD THE DISEASE.
a MICROBIOLOGIST, AN INVESTMENT BANKER, THE MOTHER OF A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.
started THINKING ABOUT WHAT WE COULD DO IF WE POOLED OUR RESOURCES.
so CLAIRE AND EMILY WERE TREATING THEMSELVES.
we DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE.
we WERE DESPERATE.
we TRIED RADICAL THERAPIES NORMAL DOCTORS WOULDN'T TOUCH.
three MONTHS AGO WE FOUND A CURE.
time-released RADIOACTIVE CAPSULES.
Yeah.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY LIE?
because THE PEOPLE WE LOVE ARE DEPENDING ON IT.
I COULDN'T TAKE THE CHANCE YOU'D STOP THAT.
Claire WOULDN'T WANT THAT.
it's WHAT GAVE US OUR LIVES BACK.
Mr. WILLIAMS, WE WILL NEED THE NAMES OF THE OTHER PATIENTS INVOLVED.
I COULD GIVE YOU SOME, BUT I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM.
you'll HAVE TO ASK DR. NADIM PATEL.
Emily's DOCTOR.
he KNEW THIS WAS GOING ON?
he CARED ENOUGH TO HELP US.
the MEDICATION. DO YOU HAVE A SAMPLE?
is THAT MY... BELLINI'S MEDICATION?
just...
tell ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
please JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME.
we KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR DISEASE, CLAIRE.
we KNOW THAT THIS...
makes YOU BETTER.
but THIS...
this WILL MAKE YOU SPECIAL.
I'm SO TIRED.
what IS THIS?
when I TOLD YOU THERE WERE UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING EMILY'S DEATH, THESE WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
we KNOW HOW IT WORKED, DR. PATEL.
Ken WILLIAMS TOLD US EVERYTHING.
what WE DON'T KNOW IS WHO ELSE WAS INVOLVED.
I'm NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS, NOT THIS.
all I DO IS GIVE THEM UPDATES. WHO'S THEY?
who's THEY? INTREPUS.
the DRUG COMPANY? YOU SHOULD JUST WALK AWAY.
you HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH, WHAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF.
I NEED A NAME, DR. PATEL.
Dr. PATEL?
Dr. PATEL.
drop IT! I SWEAR, IT WAS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE UPDATES.
Dr. PATEL, PUT THE GUN ON THE GROUND NOW.
I'm A DOCTOR, A HEALER. DO YOU WANT A NAME?
No!
Olivia, HEY.
I FOUND HIM.
he HEADS UP INTREPUS PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH DIVISION.
by ALL ACCOUNTS, HE'S SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
for A GUNS BLAZING CONGRESSIONAL LOBBYING CAMPAIGN THAT ALLOWED INTREPUS TO DIG INTO SOME OF THEIR MORE CONTROVERSIAL R&D.
define CONTROVERSIAL.
prenatal GENE THERAPY.
human-animal HYBRIDIZATION STUDIES.
viral WARFARE.
all THE FUN STUFF.
he's IN MANHATTAN TODAY.
he's SPEAKING ON A HUMANITARIAN AIDE FORUM.
listen, LIV.
even IF THE DOCTOR WAS RIGHT, EVEN IF ESTERBROOK HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE WOMEN, I'M GONNA GO OUT ON A LIMB.
I'm GONNA SAY HE'S NOT GONNA CONFESS.
I WANT TO SEE IT IN HIS EYES, CHARLIE.
I NEED TO KNOW IT'S HIM.
Mr. ESTERBROOK?
sorry TO INTERRUPT. AMANDA BENNET, BAXIL.
listen, WITH THE RISK OF SOUNDING SYCOPHANTIC, I'VE FOLLOWED YOUR WORK SINCE YALE.
three DEGREES, INCLUDING A PhD IN MEDICINAL NEUROBIOLOGY.
I COULDN'T EVEN GET THROUGH BIOCHEM WITHOUT CHEATING OFF MY ROOMMATE.
I'm SORRY.
this MUST SOUND INSANELY NAIVE TO YOU.
no, HARDLY.
science AND TECHNOLOGY HAS REACHED A POINT WHERE OUR MEANS ARE FINALLY CATCHING UP WITH OUR IMAGINATIONS,
and THE ONLY THING PREVENTING US FROM DOING TRULY VISIONARY WORK ARE THESE MORAL-BASED RESTRICTIONS THAT LAWMAKERS PUT UP IN THE NAME OF PUBLIC POLICY.
that AND MONEY.
we ALWAYS NEED MORE MONEY.
I'm GONNA LET YOU IN ON A LITTLE SECRET, AMANDA.
it ISN'T ABOUT THE MONEY.
it IS ABOUT THE RESOLVE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN ENTIRELY HONEST WITH YOU.
I DON'T WORK FOR BAXIL,
but I KNOW A COLLEAGUE OF YOURS.
Dr. NADIM PATEL.
how IS NADIM THESE DAYS?
these DAYS? DEAD.
I'm SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
not AS SORRY AS I WAS TO WATCH IT HAPPEN.
identify THEFT IS A FEDERAL CRIME, AMANDA.
so IS KIDNAPPING AND MURDER. AND IT'S AGENT DUNHAM.
tell ME, WHAT DID YOU HOPE TO GET OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION?
I ALREADY GOT IT.
how OLD ARE YOU?
you're AN ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN.
I'm SURE YOU WANT TO START A FAMILY ONE DAY.
it WOULD BE A SHAME IF ANYTHING GOT IN YOUR WAY.
when?
Hey.
I UNDERSTAND YOU PAID A LITTLE VISIT
news TRAVELS FAST.
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TYPE UP THE REPORT
in PUBLIC IN A HOTEL BAR.
I DIDN'T REALIZE MY INTERVIEW TECHNIQUES WERE UNDER SUCH CLOSE SCRUTINY.
everything WE DO IS UNDER CLOSE SCRUTINY.
this TASK FORCE THAT YOU'RE NOW PART OF,
at BEST IT'S... CONTROVERSIAL.
we NEED TO BE PERFECT.
trying TO INTIMIDATE SUCH A HIGH-PROFILE SUSPECT
in A MURDER INVESTIGATION IS RECKLESS AT BEST.
Claire WILLIAMS IS A PRISONER RIGHT NOW,
having GOD KNOW WHAT INJECTED INTO HER BODY.
and DAVID ESTERBROOK KNOWS WHERE SHE IS.
he's GUILTY, AND HE JUST ASSUMES HE'LL GET AWAY WITH IT.
so EXCUSE ME, BUT RIGHT NOW,
I COULDN'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT POLITICS.
which IS EXACTLY YOUR PROBLEM, AND NOW MINE.
you THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO WANTS TO FIND CLAIRE WILLIAMS?
you VIOLATED THE CARDINAL LAW OF OUR PROFESSION.
you LET YOUR FEELINGS DRIVE YOUR DECISION MAKING.
and AS A RESULT, YOU'VE ENDANGERED
not ONLY CLAIRE WILLIAMS' LIFE BUT EVERYTHING WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.
if I TRUST YOU TO CONTROL YOUR OWN PASSION, DUNHAM,
then I CAN'T TRUST YOU.
is THAT CLEAR?
you'll HAVE MY REPORTON THE ESTERBROOK INTERVIEW WITHIN THE HOUR.
I'll BE WAITING.
is THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE ME TO RUN PAST YOU?
not ANYTHING.
everything.
how's IT GOING?
she's ALMOST READY.
and THE CAPSULES IN HER BLOOD STREAM.
they CAN BE TRIGGERED REMOTELY?
everything's AS REQUESTED.
she'll BE STABLE AND READY FOR TRANSPORT BY MORNING.
I'll CALL THE CLIENT AND SCHEDULE DELIVERY.
you're REMARKABLE.
what's HAPPENING TO ME?
Hey, HOW'S IT GOING?
it's GREAT.
ESTERBROOK'S OUR ONLY LEAD TO WHERE THEY'RE HOLDING CLAIRE WILLIAMS,
and I CAN'T GET TO HIM.
I MEAN, THE GUY'S CLEANER THAN SNOW.
not EVEN AS MUCH AS AN UNPAID PARKING TICKET.
well, I THINK WE ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MAKING SOME PROGRESS.
couple MINUTES AGO, WALTER THOUGHT HE MIGHT HAVE ISOLATED THE COMPOUND THAT'S IN EMILY KRAMER'S BLOOD,
but THEN HE GOT DISTRACTEDBY THE UNICORN RUNNING THROUGH THE LAB.
funny.
anything ELSE?
got ANY MORE JOKES?
all RIGHT, SOMETHING'S BEEN BUGGING YOU ALL DAY.
something OTHER THAN CLAIRE WILLIAMS.
and THAT'S OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?
we're ALL ALLOWED TO HAVE OUR BAD DAYS.
what's NOT FINE IS BLAMING IT ON ME.
I WANT TO FIND HER JUST AS MUCH AS YOU DO.
you're RIGHT. I'M SORRY.
I...
I'm SORRY.
fine.
I HAD A STEPFATHER.
and WHEN HE DRANK, HE'D ACCUSE MY MOM OF SEEING OTHER MEN, AND THEN HE'D HIT HER.
and SHE JUST LIVED WITH IT.
she NEVER CALLED THE POLICE, NOT ONCE.
then ONE DAY HE BEAT HER REALLY BAD AND BROKE HER NOSE.
I WAS NINE.
stormed OUT OF THE HOUSE,
got IN HIS CAR, DROVE OFF.
my MOM'S CRYING AND I CAN'T HELP HER.
and THEN I HEAR HIS CAR.
he's TURNED BACK AROUND.
he KEPT A GUN IN THE DRAWER NEAR HIS BED.
when HE OPENED THE DOOR, I PULLED THE TRIGGER.
then I PULLED IT AGAIN.
and I CAN STILL SEE HIS FACE
almost DARING ME TO FINISH.
but I COULDN'T.
so... THEY TOOK HIM TO THE HOSPITAL
and SAID THAT HE COULDN'T BE SAVED,
but HE DIDN'T DIE.
he RECOVERED.
then ONE NIGHT, HE JUST SLIPPED AWAY.
we NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.
and I STILL BLAME MYSELF, BECAUSE I SHOULD'VE DONE IT.
I SHOULD'VE KILLED HIM.
and I KNOW THAT RATIONALLYHE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE BAD THINGS IN THE WORLD,
but HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THEM.
and EVERY YEAR HE SENDS ME A CARD ON MY BIRTHDAY JUST TO LET ME KNOW...
that HE'S STILL OUT THERE.
it's YOUR BIRTHDAY TODAY.
no MAN IS UNTOUCHABLE, OLIVIA.
if YOU REALLY WANT ESTERBROOK,
all YOU HAVE TO DO IS TALK TO YOUR FRIEND NINA SHARP.
massive DYNAMIC HAS THREE SEPARATE PHARMACEUTICAL DIVISIONS.
they're IN DIRECT COMPETITION WITH INTREPUS.
their ANNUAL BUDGET FOR CORPORATE ESPIONAGE COULD FEED A MID-SIZE NATION.
I GUARANTEE YOU SHE HAS SOMETHING ON DAVID ESTERBROOK.
Yeah, BUT EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT, I CAN'T GO TO HER. WHY NOT?
because DESPITE THEIR ANNUAL BUDGET,
corporate ESPIONAGE IS WILDLY ILLEGAL.
you REALLY THINK THAT SHE'D ADMIT THAT TO ME?
it's HERE SOMEWHERE. I KNOW IT IS.
I JUST HAVE TO LOOK HARDER.
I'm GOING OUT.
okay.
Oh, PETER!
to BE HONEST, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE HERE.
thank YOU.
excuse ME. MS. SHARP.
Hi, I'M PETER
Peter BISHOP. WALTER BISHOP'S SON.
you're NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S DONE THEIR HOMEWORK.
what CAN I DO FOR YOU, MR. BISHOP?
well, I WAS HOPING I COULD TAKE A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME.
does MS. DUNHAM KNOW YOU'RE HERE?
no, NO, SHE DOESN'T KNOW I'M HERE.
suppose WE TAKE A WALK.
you're SUGGESTING THAT INTREPUS IS CONDUCTING ILLEGAL DRUG TRIALS WITH HUMAN BEINGS.
that IS A RATHER BOLD CLAIM TO MAKE, MR. BISHOP.
how ARE YOU ABLE TO SUBSTANTIATE YOUR INFORMATION?
would YOU PUT IT PAST THEM?
let's ASSUME FOR A SECOND THAT WHAT I'M SAYING IS TRUE.
hmm. WHERE WOULD THEY DO IT?
they WOULDN'T RISK USING ONE OF THEIR OWN TESTING FACILITIES.
it'd HAVE TO BE SOME PLACE OFF THE GRID.
you KNOW, YOU STILL LOOK JUST THE SAME AS YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD.
Oh, I DOUBT YOU'LL REMEMBER,
but YOU AND I SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME TOGETHER.
some OF IT RIGHT HERE.
your FATHER AND I WERE QUITE CLOSEWHEN WE WERE BOTH MUCH YOUNGER.
now I HAVE ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION, PETER,
and SOME OF IT DOES ME NO GOOD.
well, TAKE THE AYMARA PEOPLE, FOR INSTANCE, OF CENTRAL PERU.
now I KNOW THAT THE SOIL BENEATH THEIR LAND HOUSES A NATURALLY OCCURRING METAL ALLOY THAT IS POTENTIALLY HYPERCONDUCTIVE.
I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE MANAGED TO SUCCESSFULLY CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH THESE AND OTHER TRIBAL CONCERNS IN PARTS OF THE WORLD TRADITIONALLY RESISTANT TO DEVELOPMENT.
I'm SORRY, MS. SHARP.
I THINK I MUST'VE MISSED YOUR QUESTION.
my QUESTION IS,
are YOU WILLING TO MAKE A BARGAIN?
I GIVE YOU THE EXACT LOCATION YOU WANT,
and IN EXCHANGE, I GET TO COME TO YOU SOMEDAY,
and YOU RETURN THE FAVOR.
no QUESTIONS ASKED.
so DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
do YOU SMELL THAT?
Yes, AND NEXT TIME, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE WARNING?
huh?
Oh, NOT THAT.
Methyleugenol.
the CHEMICAL RESPONSIBLE FOR GIVING HYACINTHS THEIR AROMA.
what ABOUT IT?
I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT CAUSED THE RADIOACTIVE CAPSULES IN EMILY KRAMER'S BLOODSTREAM TO BURST AT ONCE.
this IS IT, ASTERISK.
Astrid. HER NAME IS ASTRID.
I've GOT IT, PETER. METHYLEUGENOL IS THE KEY!
that's WHAT THEY INJECTED HER WITH.
that's WHY THESE WOMEN WERE CHOSEN.
by ITSELF, HARMLESS, BUT GIVEN THEIR TREATMENTS CAUSING ALL THE CAPSULES TO BURST AT ONCE.
they MADE HER RADIOACTIVE.
they TURNED HER INTO A WEAPON.
it WILL BE A DECIDEDLY BLUE COMPOUND,
and NOW THAT I
no... YES... YES!
that's IT. A BONDING AGENT.
that WILL WORK.
that WILL INTERFERE WITH THE PROCESS.
how LONG?
how LONG WILL IT TAKE TO MAKE THE CURE?
Oh, NOT LONG AT ALL NOW THAT I KNOW.
Where's OLIVIA?
when DID THIS HAPPEN?
when DID THIS BECOME THE WORLD WE LIVE IN?
these ARE THE PEOPLE WE TRUST TO TAKE CARE OF US.
5620 STAPLETON AVENUE.
the FACILITY WHERE CLAIRE WILLIAMS IS BEING HELD.
that's THE ADDRESS.
how COULD YOU POSSIBLY
radioactive ISOTOPES HAVE A HEAT SIGNATURE THAT'S VISIBLE TO SPY SATELLITES.
I HAD A FRIEND TRACK IT DOWN THROUGH THE NATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE OFFICE.
you HAVE A FRIEND AT THE NRO.
I HAVE A FRIEND WHO'S CRACKED THEIR CONTROL SYSTEMS.
Peter, IF I PULL THE TRIGGER ON THIS AND THE INFORMATION'S BAD
it's GOOD.
Charlie, I'VE GOT A SOLID LEAD.
a STRIKE TEAM. FULL TACTICAL.
how WE DOING? ALMOST THERE.
no, WE'RE SURE. THIS IS THE ONE.
we've GOT A VISIBLE HEAT SIGNATURE FROM THE ISOTOPES.
visible HEAT SIGNATURE?
radioactive ISOTOPES DON'T GIVE OFF
Walter, WALTER, STAY FOCUSED.
how WE DOING?
Oh, UH, UM, OLIVIA,
this IS THE ANTIDOTE.
okay, CHARLIE, WE'RE COMING NOW.
listen TO ME.
you MUST INJECT THIS DIRECTLY INTO HER BLOODSTREAM.
in THE JUGULAR, PREFERABLY. OKAY.
facility's LOCATED ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF FRAMINGHAM.
surveillance TEAMS REPORTED ARMED SECURITY ON THE PREMISES.
we're EXPECTING RESISTANCE,
so THIS WILL BE A TACTICAL ENTRY.
our MAIN OBJECTIVE IS SECURING THE VICTIM, CLAIRE WILLIAMS.
judging FROM THE LAYOUT,
it's LIKELY SHE'S BEING HELD AT THE BASEMENT LEVEL.
we'll ENTER THROUGH THE NORTHWEST OF THE BUILDING.
alpha TEAM WILL ENTER THROUGH THE FRONT,
clear OUT THE WEST OF THE BUILDING.
Bravo TEAM WILL CLEAR THE LOWER LEVELS.
are WE CLEAR?
then LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
FBI, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
get DOWN NOW!
hands BEHIND YOUR HEAD.
room IS CLEAR.
I NEED ONE, I NEED ONE, I NEED ONE!
look OUT!
man DOWN!
we HAVE A MAN DOWN. WE NEED IMMEDIATELY MEDEVAC.
call IT IN.
stay WITH HIM.
level's SECURE. WE'VE GOT A FEW IN CUSTODY.
any SIGN OF CLAIRE? NO.
I'm GOING DOWN. WATCH YOURSELF.
step AWAY FROM THAT, PLEASE.
where IS SHE? WHERE'S CLAIRE WILLIAMS?
agent DUNHAM, YOU CAN'T GO IN THAT ROOM.
the RADIATION, IT'LL KILL US ALL.
Claire, MY NAME'S OLIVIA DUNHAM.
I'm WITH THE FBI.
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED, BUT I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME.
I NEED YOU TO COME TO THE DOOR.
I CAN'T COME IN THERE.
my HEAD... IT HURTS.
that's MEDICINE.
I NEED YOU TO COME TO THE DOOR AND TAKE IT.
I CAN'T COME IN THERE. AAH!
Claire, LOOK AT ME! THAT'S GOOD.
now COME TO THE DOOR. THAT'S IT, GOOD, GOOD.
I NEED YOU TO TAKE THE SYRINGE.
I'm GONNA TELL YOU WHAT TO DO.
good. GOOD, CLAIRE.
look AT ME, CLAIRE!
Claire, I'M RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.
Claire, YOU NEED TO JAB YOURSELF IN YOUR JUGULAR ON THE SIDE OF YOUR NECK.
Oh, MY GOD. MY HEAD!
Claire, DO IT! YOU CAN DO THIS.
Claire, JUST DO IT. I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.
stab IT IN. AAH!
good CLAIRE
agent DUNHAM.
apparently I DIDN'T MAKE MY POINT CLEARLY ENOUGH.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE INTERESTED TO KNOW THAT CLAIRE WILLIAMS IS SAFE.
can't SAY I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT NAME.
that's ODD.
because AN EMPLOYEE OF YOURS, ELIZABETH SARNOFF,
just ADMITTED THAT YOU SUPPLIED HER WITH THE FACILITY AND THE EQUIPMENT TO MAKE EMILY KRAMER AND MS. WILLIAMS INTO HUMAN WEAPONS.
a DISGRUNTLED FORMER EMPLOYEE WILL SAY JUST ABOUT ANYTHING TO VILIFY THE BOSS THAT FIRED HER.
then YOU WON'T MIND COMING WITH ME TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
do YOU HONESTLY SEE THIS GOING ANYWHERE, AGENT DUNHAM?
I HAVE A LAW FIRM ON RETAINER THAT CHARGES MORE BY THE HOUR THAN YOU MAKE IN AN ENTIRE YEAR.
then I SUGGEST YOU GET THEM TO MEET YOU AT THE FBI.
I GUESS I WILL INCLUDE POLICE HARASSMENT IN THE LITANY OF CHARGES THAT I WILL FILE AGAINST YOU.
I'm STILL GONNA WALK YOU OUT THAT DOOR IN HANDCUFFS FOR RESISTING QUESTIONING.
so THE PRESS THAT I TIPPED OFF CAN SPLASH YOUR PICTURE ALL OVER THE NEWS.
you MAY NOT ANSWER TO ME OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, BUT YOU DO ANSWER TO A BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
and I WONDER WHAT THEIR RESPONSE WILL BE WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR COMPANY DRAGGED INTO THE MIDDLE OF A MURDER INVESTIGATION.
I GUESS BY NOW YOU'VE HEARD.
that YOU FROG MARCHED A SENIOR OFFICER OF A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR CONGLOMERATE OUT OF HIS OFFICE?
Yeah, I HEARD.
quite A FEW CAMERAS THERE.
the PRESS.
they ALWAYS GET THEIR POUND OF FLESH.
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU THINK I ACTED TOO EMOTIONALLY.
and PUTTING ASIDE THE FACT THAT MEN ALWAYS SAY THAT ABOUT WOMEN THEY WORK WITH,
I'll GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINT.
I AM EMOTIONAL. I DO BRING IT INTO MY WORK.
it's WHAT MOTIVATES ME.
it HELPS ME TO GET INTO THE HEADSPACE OF OUR VICTIMS,
see WHAT THEY'VE SEEN.
even IF I DON'T WANT TO. EVEN IF IT HORRIFIES ME.
and I THINK IT MAKES ME A BETTER AGENT.
if YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT, SORRY.
you CAN FIRE ME.
but I HOPE YOU DON'T.
you're NOT GETTING OFF THAT EASY, AGENT DUNHAM.
I'll SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
today AS THE SPIKE IN THE PRICE OF OIL AGAIN SENT TREMORS THROUGH THE FINANCIAL MARKETS,
but FOR PURE SHOCK VALUE NOTHING BEATS TODAY'S VERY PUBLIC DETAINMENT ON INTREPUS' DAVID ESTERBROOK BY THE FBI.
Intrepus STOCK IS BEING ABSOLUTELY PUMMELED IN OVERNIGHT TRADING,
and ANALYSTS PREDICT IT WILL OPEN AT $23 A SHARE.
that's A TEN-YEAR LOW.
which, OF COURSE, IS VERY GOOD NEWS FOR INTREPUS' COMPETITORS,
most NOTABLY MASSIVE DYNAMIC.
shares OF MD ARE UP ALMOST 12% AS INVESTORS FLEE TO THE MOST RELIABLE BRAND IN THE SECTOR.
did YOU LOCK YOURSELF OUT AGAIN?
actually, WALTER, THIS IS OUR HOTEL.
Oh.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
sure.
I'll SEE YOU UPSTAIRS, OKAY?
it's NICE TO SEE YOU.
good NIGHT, WALTER.
and REMEMBER TONIGHT, PLEASE,
the RED TOOTHBRUSH IS MINE.
white FOR WALTER.
that's ME. RIGHT?
Yes.
everything OKAY?
I KNOW WHERE YOU GOT YOUR INFORMATION.
about CLAIRE WILLIAMS.
what WAS HER PRICE?
what DID NINA SHARP WANT IN RETURN?
nothing UNTOWARD, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT.
you DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'm A BIG BOY. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
you've BEEN LOOKING OUT FOR ME,
so I'M JUST RETURNING THE FAVOR.
thank YOU.
there WAS NO LETTER TODAY, WAS THERE?
no.
happy BIRTHDAY.
you BETTER GET BACK UPSTAIRS BEFORE WALTER FALLS ASLEEP IN YOUR BED.
Yeah.
he HAS ACTUALLY DONE THAT BEFORE.
while I WAS SLEEPING.
really NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT TO WAKE UP TO.
good NIGHT.
good NIGHT.
fringe...
they're calling these events "the pattern," as if someone out there is experimenting.
only the whole world is their lab.
anybody you need, you can have.
his name's Walter bishop.
you're saying I can talk to John?
you could access his memories.
you fall in love with your partner, who betray you-- he dies in your arms.
I saw him last night.
Hello, Liv.
I grabbed my gun, but he was gone.
when you were in the tank, part of his consciousness crossed over into yours.
sorry. - I've been calling your cell.
the west side highway was a parking lot. Did they start?
Charlotte's been tap dancing for the last 20 minutes. - Damn it.
wait, wait... the tie.
thank you. - Don't forget this.
breathe.
and extenzalife's market has remained remarkably stable.
especially given wall street's recent financial difficulties.
but let me turn things over to the man you've come to hear.
hello. - Mark.
sorry. I'm late.
thank you for your patience.
it's quickly fading.
right. So let's get started.
okay, as you can see from figure six, the three-year rate of return on extenzalife products...
well, Mr. Young, a rocky start.
but I'll be letting the board know we're in good hands. - Thank you.
bastard.
son of a
Lauren and Craig will be here. Remember Craig? He's from south africa.
Yeah, I remember him.
are you sure Bobby's gonna be okay with it?
you know, Beth, not everybody likes a surprise.
Oh, please, the man loves being the center of attention.
do you know how many times he told me the he didn't want a party for his birthday?
anyway, I'm glad you're coming. It's been ages since-- ... Had a chance to really talk.
Yeah, can you hold on one sec? I've got another call.
Hello?
I need you to pick up the others and get to Marlboro airport.
okay, I'm gonna tell you something. You're gonna think I'm joking, but I'm not.
I quit.
only just for the next couple of days, and I'm happy to rejoin the others after the weekend.
runway 14. The plane will be waiting.
so where are we going?
new YORK CITY
multinational corporation. Secret biological research. Defense department's largest contractor.
seems like such an innocent name for a corporation, don't you think?
that's odd. - What?
the lacerations on the body.
these, no doubt, were caused by shards of glass. But these under the shirt
if they were caused by the glass, how come the shirt's not torn?
a fall of such height would cause compound fractures, massive internal bleeding, all in evidence in this poor chap, I'm sorry to say.
but wounds this delicate are most unlikely.
so what do you think caused 'em?
too early to tell.
it's a shame I don't have a lab, I'd like to examine him.
you do have a lab, Walter. Your lab at Harvard.
Yes, I do, don't I?
mark Young was a capable executive who displayed no signs of emotional dysfunction.
he was one of our more promising analysts, in fact.
popular among his co-workers.
then why do you think he would jump to his death?
I don't want to sound callous, agent Dunham, but when you run a company of over 300, 000 employees, you sometimes see a small percentage who succumb to the stress of their responsibilities...
and on occasion, the nature of our work.
what do you mean by that, "the nature of our work"?
I was simply referring to the pressure to deliver results, which the private sector seems to require.
you would find it exhilarating.
are you trying to change the subject by offering me another job?
well, I'd hate to sound like a suitor who is constantly being turned down for a date.
just to be clear, as flattered as I am, I'm going to go wherever this investigation takes me.
I would expect nothing less.
and I would expect more from you than the polite appearance of cooperation.
you knew this man.
he was a rising star in your company.
there must be something more you can tell me about him.
when one's domain includes the cutting edge of science, there is a risk of exposure to...
ideas that aren't easy to reconcile. Certain realities.
I'm sure you know what I mean, doing the work that you do.
for some, it's too much to take.
do you ever wonder how we survived as a species without drugs?
the hard drive is password protected.
once we break the encryption, we'll send you his data.
okay. Thank you.
well, he wasn't planning on killing himself three days ago.
he just booked a plane ticket.
to where?
omaha, on the 22nd of December.
Christmas in Nebraska. Sounds depressing.
Yeah, well, maybe he's got family there.
did you find something?
no.
seems my suspicions were correct.
these wounds go all the way down to the bone itself.
as if they originated on the inside and pierced their way up through the body tissue.
how did that happen?
that is an excellent question.
Peter, do you know what I've been remembering?
aspects of your childhood.
that's charming, Walter. Blood samples are ready.
anything in there that explains those lacerations?
no, I don't believe so.
typical medications.
all of them surprily legal.
so they wouldn't have harmed him?
that is correct.
although they could have been used as a carrier to transfer the foreign compound to the victim's brain.
what foreign compound?
Oh, didn't I mention?
a synthetic in the blood.
an ergoline derivative.
perhaps he was treated for migraines.
but it does not explain what caused these wounds.
coffee yogurt.
the synthetic compound? - Peter.
when he was 13, all he would eat was coffee yogurt.
almost drove his mother to tears.
Walter, that wasn't me. That was you.
Hello?
if that's agent Dunham, tell her to bring some coffee yogurt.
can you hold on for one second?
he's right. About the yogurt.
in case you haven't noticed, I can be quite obsessive.
Really?
Hey, you still there?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I just didn't realize what it would do, you know, hearing your voice.
listen
no, listen, don't bother making up a story, Peter.
I know you're back.
I need to see you.
Peter?
I can't get away right now.
well, then, when?
the Ultimate...
monarch ...

Hey, Liv, what do you know about a bunch of frogs?
I just got a P. O.Request from agent Farnsworth asking to send a terrarium and ten pounds of live insect larvae, and charge it off to the mark young case.
there something you want to talk to me about?
I had some frogs transferred to the lab as evidence.
these frogs, you think they had something to do with why the guy jumped out of the window?
probably not.
okay.
Charlie. - Yeah?
come with me.
you know after John died, you told me that I should maybe take some time off?
you said that what happened with him was going to affect me in ways that I couldn't even anticipate.
Yeah. - Yeah.
you were right.
I feel like I'm going clinically insane. Literally.
I told you I saw him standing right in front of me.
this happened again?
and he's called me. And he sent me an email.
and at first I thought it was him helping me, like when we were partners.
I know how it sounds.
have you spoken to Dr. Katz?
even though it's confidential, I'll still have a psych eval on my record.
I know, it seems so selfish to even say it, but I
I was thinking may I could just take a personal leave.
just do nothing for a week or two and maybe clear my head.
think that'll help?
I don't know.
Dunham. - agent Dunham, it's me.
Dr. Bishop wants you back immediately.
he thinks you've cracked the case. - What?
you are not gonna believe this, but, um, the guy who jumped out the window?
Dr. Bishop thinks it's because of the frogs.
Oh, thanks.
I wasn't sure you'd be here.
that makes two of us.
you look good, Tess.
you look older. - Older?
when my father first saw me, he told me he thought I'd be fatter.
but I gotta tell you, older actually kinda hurts.
your father--since when do you see your father?
long story. - Wait, listen to me.
if I can find you, then they can find you.
I know.
they'll hurt you.
can I get you a cup of coffee? Something to eat, maybe?
nothing changes with you, huh?
it's the same old Peter.
you just play it fast and loose until it's too late.
it was easy ough for you to leave the first time.
why should it be any different now, right?
I know that you believe that, Tessa.
but you have to trust me, it was harder than you think.
trust you?
I'm not sure I ever even knew you.
Yeah, you did.
maybe better than anyone. You still do.
what does that say about you?
I'm not kidding.
you need to leave Boston and never come back ever.
is that what you want me to do? - How can you ask me that? Come on.
Tessa, look, it's comp
Michael. - Things have changed.
Yeah, apparently.
it'll be worse for you if you stay.
psychophysiologic effect, otherwise known as psychosomatic.
the ability of the mind to cause actual physical changes in the body.
mind over matter, like when you get scared and you get goosebumps.
precisely.
although it is possible for the body to manifest physical changes imagined in the brain in a far more dramatic fashion, this test subject is in a highly suggestible state, as you can see in this archive footage.
a form of hypnosis.
I convinced him that he was in a meat locker.
and what is more impressive, I told him that this ice cube was a burning coal.
Oh, my god.
cruel, I suppose, but very enlightening.
so, lter, what does this have to do with frogs?
uh, toads, actually-- bufo alvarius.
a species which secretes a psychoactive compound.
the substance which I couldn't identify in Mr. Young was in fact a concentration of the venom produced in the skin.
properly altered, it's an hallucinogen.
a very powerful one.
quite unlike anything I have taken.
it directly affects the amygdala, which is the fear center of the brain.
so you're saying that Mark Young hallucinated being cut on his body, and then his mind made it actually happen.
Yes. A very clever means of murder.
what do you mean "murder"?
Oh, come on, we've discussed this.
I'm sure we have discussed this.
no, no, you and I did before Olivia got here.
the potency of the dose that I found in Mr. Young's blood was at least 30 times that that any sane person would ingest.
which suggests that someone else gave him the drugs.
so whoever those frogs belong to may be the killer.
I already ran a property record search on the shed where you found the toads, but nothing came up.
how'd you even find it in the first place?
it's a long story.
the shed where I found the frogs, John Scott led me to it.
you've been seeing him again...
because his memories are still in your head.
his memories? - Yes.
trapped like fragments-- snapshots in your mind.
your work on this case must be a trigger to some knowledge he had.
so how long?
I mean, how long is this gonna keep happening?
could last for many years.
I need to get it out.
I can't keep having john's life flash in front of my eyes every few days.
there must be something you can do.
perhaps...
using a form of repressed memory therapy, we may be able to bring the memories to the surface, and purge them from your unconscious.
but-- - but you'd have to put me back in the tank.
Yes. Yes.
and I would always advise against that.
the risk of physical, not to mention mental damage, it might cause could be catastrophic.
Walter, I'll do it.
I need to do it.
yeah? - Peter, it's agent Farnsworth.
um, where are you?
putting some gas in the car. Why, what's up?
I think you should just come back.
how long is going to take?
miss Dunham, what we're doing, what you have asked me to do, is pushing the boundaries of all that is real and possible.
we're not roasting a turkey.
the library was not open.
I had to go to the book store.
what for?
when you're in the tank, you must listen to my voice at all times.
Uh--uh, this is a technique I developed decades ago in this very lab.
most of which I don't remember.
is Peter coming? - Yes.
is that a bible?
Yes.
last time you were in the sensory deprivation tank, you went into a state of shared consciousness with agent Scott.
during that time, part of his memories crossed over into your brain.
by putting you into a state of deep hypnosis, and by giving you substantial doses of psychoactive drugs,
I can help you to access those alien memories that your mind has repressed.
my voice is your guide.
it is also your tether to reality.
you must focus on my voice, or you may risk being lost in the memories.
what?
I just got an erection.
Oh, fear not. It's nothing to do with your state of undress.
I think I simply need to urinate. - That's good to know.
will you get her in the tank, please?
are you sure about doing this again?
all I want is for it to stop.
but if his memories can do some good, then at least I wasn't deceived for nothing.
you'll begin to feel sleepy.
you must listen to my voice all times.
concentrate on the name of the man from whom you seek information.
and look for signs.
signs?
I'll tell you when you get there.
Walter, what was the bible for?
well, you're taking untested psychedelics, lying in saline with an electric charge in the base of your cranium.
among other things, I thought it appropriate to pray you don't get electrocuted.
praise the lord.
Amen.
next!
then I will sprinkle clean water upon you.
and ye shall be clean.
and of all thy filthiness, "and all thy idols, "I will cleanse thee d a new spirit "I will give to thee.
and a new spirit I will put within thee.
wow, nice.
I didn't know you were so religious.
I'm not. Not anymore.
Olivia, can you hear me?
Yes.
good.
you see the end of the escalator, Olivia?
you will step off in five, four, three, two, one.
take a moment. Look around. What do you see?
I see nothing.
just light.
Olivia, listen carefully.
apart from my voice, what else do you hear?
music.
excellent. Where's it coming from?
you should be able to see something.
there's nothing.
I don't know where I am.
stand by.
anything now? What do you see?
nothing.
wait.
there's a door. - Good.
walk through it.
tell me where you end up.
I'm in a restaurant.
does it look familiar?
sort of.
but I don't know why.
this is where we had our first date.
and there we are. This is our first date.
can--can you see yourself and john?
what's going on?
she's gone back in. - What?
Olivia went back in the tank? Why?
son, I need your help.
Walter, you said that this was dangerous.
Oh, it is. Very.
she thinks John Scott had information about the man who killed himself.
so what? She went back in the tank to go talk to John Scott?
to see his memories.
look at him.
he looks so alive.
so real.
I need you to adjust the drugs.
well, what did you give her this time?
drugs I'd rather be taking myself.
set the iv to ten drips per.
Peter, please.
I'm getting up. What should I do?
fear not. This is just a memory.
um, just visiting. They cannot see you.
he's alone.
he cannot hear you or speak with you. You're in a memory.
he cannot interact with you.
Olivia, I'm going to take you elsewhere.
I loved you.
tonight, during dinner,
I loved you.
but you were lying to me about who you were.
I mean, did you ever have any feelings for me at all, or was it all just...
mark Young killed himself yesterday.
he sees me.
no, Olivia. He definitely does not see you.
I'm somewhere else.
I'm in John's car.
good. Do you see any clues?
I'm alone.
he must be there.
find out where you are.
there's no one here.
it's his memory. He must be there somewhere.
I see them.
who? Ask her what she sees.
e?
there's four men.
there's John, a black guy, one who looks Latino, and the fourth I can't see.
I don't know who they are.
let's give him a minute.
this is a big decision he's about to make.
all right, I'm good.
Oh, my god. It's Mark Young.
I see him. He's here.
can you hear him?
I'll get closer.
young's leaving with the Latino.
I'm going after them.
now you just do your part and we'll take care of you.
they've disappeared.
that's because you're not in their memories. You're in John's.
you must go back to him.
you know if it's on time?
it will be.
he'll deliver. He's just a little nervous.
see the look he gave me when you told him how much you'd be willing to offer?
I hope you're right.
if we get into another Ashby situation we're screwed.
No! Stop! Get me outta here! Walter!
so just a little less chin.
okay. How's this?
that's it. That's the Latino guy I saw in john's memory.
he's the only one of the four still alive.
we need to figure out who he is and find him.
so can we get this to Charlie, and maybe we can get it ID?
got it.
you're on my clothes.
Oh, sorry. - That's okay.
you okay? - Yeah.
John's memories gave us a lead.
so I better get a move on.
I need to see Broyles.
you want some company? - No.
Thanks.
Olivia, if you need me, I'm here.
Yeah, I know.
we believe Mark Young was murdered for selling technologies to black market buyers.
and we believe that this man was part of an underground group responsible for brokering a sale of a synthetic hallucinogen manufactured by Massive Dynamics' Drug division.
and what would be the black market applications of this hallucinogen?
the drug could easily be mass produced as a cheap street drug or worse.
in its potent form, used as a chemical weapon.
apparently it can literally scare you to death.
then don't let me slow you down. Sounds like you're doing fine.
there's just one more thing.
we're gonna need Massive Dynamic to disclose every project that Mark Young was working on.
you're right.
although that'll be easier said than done.
I'll see what I can do.
if you touch her again, I'll kill you.
any luck?
we've been running facial recognition software.
so far no matches.
witness sightings?
NYPD's passing the composite around Young's apartment building and office as we speak.
Oh, yeah, I need you to cross reference all of John Scott's case files with mark young.
Yeah. Hold on.
from Nina Sharp.
mark Young's projects.
Yeah, can you call me back if you find something? Thank you.
Hello?
Hello, I'm calling on behalf of your long distance carrier.
I'm not interested.
and I don't want you calling again.
so you better take me off your list, okay?
I need this phone traced.
this is our guy. - how do you know?
I recognize his voice.
you recognize his voice?
it's him, Charlie. I swear.
come on. - Almost there.
got it. It's a land line, but it was forwarded to a cell.
where?
he's in transit on route 3 heading to Lcoln tunnel.
how far out are we?
about a mile and closing.
we got 'em.
name on the account is George Morales. Age 43.
purchased a plane ticket this morning.
3: 45 flight down to Sao Paolo out of JFK.
so he must be on his way there now.
according to NCIC, he's a black market trafficker, high end.
so how far out are we?
550 yards.
echo flank left foxtrot.
flank right.
wait, he stopped.
what, did we lose the signal?
no, he just stopped.
so do you think he ditched his phone?
I don't know why he would. There's no way he could've spotted us.
looks like he hit traffic.
Where's the transponder? Let's go.
I'm told you wanted to see me.
Yes. I want to make a deal.
I'll tell you everything I know.
I'm not sure what you have to trade.
under title 18 of the U. S.Code, we have you for possession of chemical weapons.
on top of suspicion of murder of Mark Young.
I want protection.
you mean immunity.
no, I an protection.
from Massive Dynamic.
you need to move me from here right now.
what are you talking about?
I didn't kill anybody.
why would I?
that guy was a treasure trove of unbelievable things.
massive Dynamic killed him.
massive Dynamic killed Mark Young?
that's right.
why would they?
maybe as a warning to any employee who's thinking of doing the same thing.
maybe?
I think it's easy to invent a story that you think I want to hear.
Really? Did I invent ZFD?
flight 627? The Northwoods group?
John Scott? The pattern?
the whole thing is-- is a hoax.
it's all a smoke screen so Massive Dynamic can do whatever it wants to whoever it wants.
do you understand that?
massive Dynamic is hell.
and its founder, William Bell, is the devil.
and I can prove all of it.
but only if I get protection.
so why me?
why do I get the privilege of your cooperation?
because I know I can trust you.
you don't even know me.
John Scott told me about you.
immunity...
and complete protection.
and I will tell you everything I know.
agent Dunham, I don't recall seeing you on my schedule today.
well, I don't need an appointment, Ms. Sharp.
it's all right.
no matter where my investigations take me, they always come back here.
well, I don't know what you've heard since we last saw each other, but I would hope that my cooperation would've garnered some benefit of the doubt.
massive Dynamic has nothing to hide.
it's about time.
what took you so long?
see, I believe that your cooperation is an illusion.
it never leads to something tangible.
it only leads to more questions.
and that's the point, isn't it?
to keep us all asking questions?
all just chasing our own tails?
are you sure you're feeling well, Ms. Dunham?
I think perhap you're perceiving things that are entirely in your mind's eye.
I wanted to thank you for all your job offers.
and I'm sorry that it's taken me so long to give you an answer, but I, um, I think I finally have one.
Yes, it's obvious in your expression.
well, I understand that you've captured your suspect.
I imagine at in an effort to seek an immunity agreement from your agency, he's attempting to blame Massive Dynamic for all his foul deeds.
are you protecting your CEO, William Bell?
because if you are, now is the time to tell me.
once our witness talks, you lose all leverage in a plea.
I seriously doubt that your witness will be able to provide any actionable evidence to implicate Massive Dynamic or William Bell of any wrong doing.
no, please! No, john, please! Don't
I won't say anything.
our witness is dead. - What?
seems he was drugged with the same substance as Mark Young.
how? We had guards on his room.
we don't know yet, but a nurse saw his throat open up right before her eyes.
excuse me?
she got to him.
and there'll be no evidence of that. Just like you said.
Dunham, Nina Sharp and Massive Dynamic have been nothing but cooperative with this investigation.
I suggest you keep your unfounded accusations in check.
can you come out?
um, I need to go back in.
in our room? - Uh, no.
in the tank.
there are too many questions.
like who's working for whom? And why?
who should be arrested? Who's plotting what?
and if John had the answers, then the answers are still in his memory, which means that they're in my memory.
ms. Dunham-- - please, Walter. We're wasting time.
it's dangerous.
I am prepared to take that risk.
there is little that makes me happier than taking drugs.
perhaps administering them, designing and carrying out experiments that bend the plane of what we consider reality.
I'm rarely if ever opposed to such things except now.
but I tell you, you'll damage yourself.
every time you go back in, the risk of permanent damage:
seizures, aneurysms, memory loss, death
but if I don't go back in, others may die.
and if you do, the death could be your own.
there are no guarantees that you will retrieve the memories you're looking for.
and remember, there can be no interaction with him.
you can't just ask.
he did see me.
no. No, that is not possible.
give me some time.
I will try to develop a safer technique.
but not tonight. You need to rest.
sleep well.
you too.
tell him to have the money or I'll have to break his legs too. I gotta go.
what the hell happened to you?
he's back in town. Peter bishop.
Peter bishop, really?
I SAW...
security cameras out. Disarming alarm.
alarm disarmed. - Roger. We're in.
how are we doing?
loop is up. You're good to go.
how are we doing? - Good to go.
okay. Powering up.
three, two, one... Charge.
Oscillation's good.
ready to open the grid.
where are we?
96%-- 98-- resonance set.
give me the grid.
be careful.
magnet firm.
how long do we have?
confirming density and thickness.
a minute 41. 40...
let's go.
give me a charge gel.
57 seconds. We got to move.
34 seconds.
I got it. Down.
let's move.
grab everything and let's go.
get it up.
okay, take it through.
you got it?
they got to move or they're not gonna make it.
lugo, let's go.
the magnet. It won't disengage.
disengage it. We've got to go now!
you go. I'm working on it. Go! I'm right behind you.
15 seconds. What the hell's he doing?
the magnet's stuck.
he can't leave that in there. We're screwed if he does.
Yeah, well, I think he understands that.
come on.
we got slack.
ten seconds... Nine seconds...
all right, I'm ready. Pull me through.
we got two seconds. Come on, pull!
come on! Push yourself through!
it's hard! Pull me through!
grab everything. Let's go.
no-- no-- help me, please.
let's go.
let's go!
what do you mean you don't have one? Everybody's got one. Even I've got one.
what's that, a spleen?
Yeah, Walter, a spleen.
and this one suffers from asplenia, a rare genetic condition in which one is born spleenless.
thank you, Walter.
so, you seriously don't have a best friend?
Nope. Well, does a sister count?
of course a sister doesn't count.
well, I guess that i've always just enjoyed being on my own.
even when I was at boarding school, they used to call me "han."
as in "solo"? That's cute. Least you had a nickname.
this is Phillip Broyles with homeland security.
please have him call me as soon as possible.
Yes, and they'll connect you.
clear the area, please.
this is fascinating.
security guard was killed, the surveillance cameras disabled.
so, what do we have? - we have nothing.
this incident may be related to a recent series of bank robberies, this would be the third.
all in Philadelphia?
first was in Cleveland, the second in Baltimore.
I was in Baltimore.
I remember a woman with particularly large breasts.
each time the only thing that's been taken has been a single, oversized safe deposit box.
all without so much as a breach of the vault.
are the boxes traceable?
I have a call in to the bank manager now.
the who, what, and why, that's you.
just when you thought things couldn't get any weirder.
Peter, I know this man.
what, the guy in the wall? Really?
let me guess. He's your best friend.
no, I mean it.
you know him from where?
to determine what happened here, we'll have to cut him out of the wall.
at least pieces of him.
I'll need some of this netting as well.
you know this man?
he was in my first unit in the marines.
then you have my condolences.
you're being serious? - Yeah.
he's from Jersey. Uh, he's married. His wife's named susan.
he plays baseball. He lives in Edison. I've been to his house.
bullet in the head or no, leaving a guy halfway stuck in the wall wasn't the most professional move.
I thought it was a nice touch.
you can joke about it all you want.
Yeah, thanks.
we had another grid.
we should have tried to get him out.
how are we doing?
crappy. Self-sealing bolts, magnetic tumblers, some kind of old-school chromo-alloy.
someone really didn't want this opened. - How long?
couple of hours, maybe three.
we have one more box to go.
if your bitching about raul is your way of saying you want out, then go.
otherwise inject yourself and shut your mouth.
WISSENSCHAFT...
Mr. Kohl. Please come in.
this is amazing!
the scale of this hardware store in unprecedented.
actually, it's completely precedented.
there are stores like this everywhere, Walter.
all around the world, in every city.
if anyone knows that, it's you.
all right, what's that supposed to mean?
my last phrase? - Yes, your last phrase.
if anybody knows that, "it's you." What is that?
I was implying that you traveled extensively.
no, you were implying that I haven't stayed still much in the last 15 years.
you were implying, and you've been implying with increasing frequency,
that you don't approve of my admittedly nomadic existence.
in short, Walter, you're saying that you're disappointed I haven't made more out of my life.
that's what you're implying.
Yes, I suppose so.
the reason this store seems like such a miracle to you is because you've been holed-up in a mental institution for the better part of the last two decades,
which effectively does two things.
one, it precludes you from knowing much of anything about me.
about who I am, who i've been, what I know, and what I've done.
and two, it renders any fatherly judgments you may have of me moot.
are we clear?
can I help you guys find something?
Oh, yes. we're looking for an electric saw,
preferably variable speed with an easily replaceable blade system.
what are you cutting? Wood? - Human tissue. Flesh and bone.
it's more sinuous than you may expect.
it's really not that dire.
Oh, actually, potentially it's far worse.
um, I think that the saw that you're looking for is around the corner, next to the routers.
thank you.
no need to call the police.
Mr. Jones, as you know, we only have so much time. So...
the sentencing is scheduled for next week.
as I told you before, I think the best we can hope for is life.
however, I will be filing an appeal-- - you're spoke to my people?
do they have any news for me?
Yes, they said that the "job" in philadelphia was successful.
Oh, good. Please tell them the following.
they are to wire Mr. Loeb another $100, 000
and to inform him of the location of the next item.
I'll pass that along.
thank you.
here is the document.
if you could just take a quick look at it?
this is a standard document for appeal.
if you'll just sign on the-- what are you doing?
items that I will need upon your next visit.
my people will provide them for you.
Dramine?
sun tan lotion? What are these for?
as my employee, it really is none of your concern now, is it?
what size are you? Your suit size?
40 long. Why?
the address of my personal tailor.
he'll fix up something nice for you.
my way of saying thank you for all you've done for me.
Edison...
yes?
Susan. - Yeah.
hello.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I just can't believe it.
I just can't believe he's dead.
Raul moved out about two years ago.
we hadn't spoken in months.
you know, I am so sorry.
and please forgive me, but did he mention these robberies?
no.
can't say I'm surprised though.
what do you mean?
ever since he came back from the war, he was just dark. depression, drinking,
and I tried to help the best way I could, I swear to god, but
I'm sure you did.
do you know anyone he was hanging out with?
any of his recent friends? Because I hadn't seen Raul in years.
you knew Raul?
Yes, of course.
we served together in the marines.
Oh, I didn't know.
we have met before. - Who? You and I?
Yes, we had dinner here.
you were in my house?
it took me a little while to rember because it was so long ago,
but raul and I met at camp pendleton.
and we had dinner here, the night that he became first lieutenant.
no, you weren't here.
Susan, I'm sorry, but I was.
and you were a wonderful host. you made pot roast
and it burned, yes, and we had to order in.
Yeah, and the delivery guy dropped the bag right here.
and that piano was actually in front of the window and the sofa was here by the fire.
Yes, I rember, but you were not here.
the day Raul made first lieutenant, it was just me, Raul, and John.
who?
Raul's friend from pendleton, john.
John who?
are you okay?
almost there, son.
get ready.
you can do it.
nice catch. Well done.
I'm carrying a tray, Walter. It's not exactly rocket science.
what I said before didn't come out as I intended.
what, the crack about the breasts?
no, about my disappointment in you.
it has more to do with your potential than anything else.
you have no idea what you're capable of, Peter.
that's sweet, Walter, but ultimately unfair.
especially coming from you.
so, what have we got here so far?
nothing yet.
Walter seems to think that if we can examine this guy's flesh at the cellular level,
we might be able to figure out how it is that they pass through solid matter.
what we perceive as solid matter is mostly empty space.
just as me may perceive that a life is full that is actually a series of empty encounters.
he's been like that all day. It's been awesome.
to accomplish this, your bank robbers would need cutting edge knowledge of quantum physics,
not to mention technology that would cost more than dozen banks could hold.
how did it go with Raul Lugo's wife?
well, they were separated, so she hadn't had much contact with him for months.
but she said he suffered from depression.
are you okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
no, peter's right.
your pupils are dilated.
it's a symptom of high stress.
unless you're using hallucinogens.
are you tripping, agent Dunham?
I didn't recognize Raul Lugo, John Scott did.
you're confusing John Scott's memories... - with my own.
so, you never met this guy?
no, but I could have sworn I did.
I don't understand that.
I need to look into that.
okay, but first we need to figure out what happened here.
who did this, what they want, and what they're gonna do next.
success.
nice job.
are you ever gonna let us see what's in these boxes?
I don't think so.
and even if I did, you wouldn't understand it.
well, I thought we were making progress.
we were, but we've hit a dead end trying to reconstruct John Scott's memories.
if we push further, we risk destroying the fragments we're trying to retrieve.
well, not to place any undue pressure on you and your team,
but we're in a race against highly motivated individuals.
and right now, John Scott is our only advantage.
understood.
so, why did you need me to go get all that rice?
no talking!
seriously, Walter, what's the rice for?
and while I'm at it, what's with all the toys?
Oh, these were in my storage.
they're your toys, son, from when you were a little boy.
those aren't mine.
then I suppose they must be mine. It's the netting, Peter.
I believe the swatch left behind is from a larger piece.
it was draped over the vault wall.
that somehow is the key, although I'm not sure yet exactly how they would
what do you see he?
so far some rice and a bunch of toys.
this gentleman is standing on what appears to be solid.
however, add vibration...
I'm quite envious of this.
of what?
well, somehow the robbers were able to weaken the vault wall.
high frequency vibrations disrupting its atomic structure
allowing another piece of solid matter through it.
well, obviously what I'm showing you here is a theoretical example.
in actuality, this feat would be immensely complicated and apparently not without consequences.
it seems the use of this technology can render one slightly radioactive.
how slightly? - well...
not as slightly as I thought.
miss? Would you mind putting the hand on ice?
it will help preserve the tissue.
just so I'm clear, Walter, the robbers have managed to not only violate the natural laws of the universe,
but they're also becoming radioactive?
who's radioactive?
our robbers apparently. Where have you been?
I've been working. Where have you been?
I've been buying rice for walter's toys.
did you get any leads on the safety deposit boxes?
Yeah, they were all purchased 23 years ago.
all paid for in cash, bogus names on each account.
how radioactive?
slightly.
though not as slight as Walter would like.
so, we have no idea who those safety deposit boxes belong to?
no, and it's untraceable.
can you call all the hospitals in and around the philadelphia area,
get them to call us if anyone comes in showing signs of radiation poisoning.
Yeah, I'm on it. - okay.
so, what's our next move?
Raul Lugo was a good kid before the military.
he had a clean record, responsible employee.
I want to know how he became a criminal.
why they recruited him and what they promised him.
all right, so how are we gonna do that?
lugo's wife gave me some names.
it just so happens his best friend from high school works at a bar in cambridge.
did i just hear "bar in cambridge"?
Hey, Astrid, would you mind Watching Walter?
Yeah, I'm on that, too.
now, miss, I'm going to repeat the demonstration with the rice.
would you care to watch? - Nope.
okay.
just go along with this, okay?
sure thing, boss.
how's your night? - I've had worse. What can I get you?
double shot of whiskey. - a double. What's your preference?
your call. - you?
same as the lady.
I'm Stephanie. This is my brother, Rick.
Hey, brother Rick.
you know, you look familiar.
Oh, me?
Cheers.
um-- I'll take another.
are you sure we haven't met before?
I don't think so.
what's your name? - Drew.
drew, I got to tell you, I never forget a face.
it's true, she doesn't. It's kind of creepy actually.
I got it. Raul and susan's wedding.
no way. You were there?
you were the best man. - Yeah.
it's incredible, right?
she's been able to do that since we were kids. Remember that?
I do.
so do you still see them?
no, it's been years.
I was friends with susan in college, but we lost contact, too.
it's horrible. Where are they living now?
you know, I don't know. I heard they split.
Oh, no.
Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.
why not?
I don't know. Raul got weird.
weird how? - You know he was in the gulf war?
he sort of-- I don't know, it was post-traumatic stress or something.
I feel bad.
I'm sure I would have lost my mind if i'd gone to the gulf war as well.
anyway, when he got back, he didn't come around much.
he started hanging out at the va lot. - which one?
I don't know. - It's a shame. He was a good guy. Excuse me.
sure.
brother?
Yeah. It, uh-- it kind of works better that way.
does it now?
it's Dunham. Look, I was wondering if you could find out what va hospital Raul Lugo might have gone to.
there was nothing in any of his records.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm calling you. Can you help me?
I'll do what I can.
I'll have an answer for you in an hour. - Thanks.
let's go. We've got an hour to kill.
what's the rush? Two is your limit?
is that a dare?
rook to e-7. Check.
so, I took a look at his papers while he was checking out whatev - So? - It's a map of germany.
Germany? - Yeah, Frankfurt. Lines all over it. Latitude and longitude.
looks like he's planning a damn invasion.
I got next.
all right, listen up. We're headed out. Let's go.
where to? - Providence.
pick a card.
all right.
now, I need you to memorize that card. - Okay.
you got it? - Yeah, I got it.
you sure? - Yes.
absolutely positive? - Absolutely positive.
because if you don't, it doesn't work.
okay, I remember. - Okay, good.
and just like everything else we do around here, it's about to get weirder.
it's pretty good, right? - That was great.
okay, so top that. - Okay.
Seriously? Oh, that's fantastic. Women never have card tricks.
tell me when to stop.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven-- - stop.
which one?
four of clubs.
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12-- - stop.
queen of diamonds.
you can count cards.
that's all I would do when I was a kid.
I'm sure that if I was a child today, I would be diagnosed with something.
I just have this thing for numbers.
I see them once and remember them the rest of my life.
Seriously?
Yeah, my best friend from high school's 7240168.
my locker combination in middle school: 36-21-7.
the numbers of the safety deposit boxes: 233, 377, and 610.
what? - I could do more.
no, no, no. Say that again. The numbers on the safety deposit boxes.
233, 377, and 610. Why?
I know those numbers.
Walter? Hey, Walter! Wake up，Walter.
Walter, wake up. This is important.
do you two want to use the room?
Walter, this is important. The numbers you recite every night, what are they?
numbers?
every night you recite a sequence of numbers to help you fall asleep.
precisely, those. What is that pattern?
it's a fibonaccI sequence.
you should know that, Peter. If you had stayed at college
Walter, not everybody knows the fibonaccI sequence.
Oh, sure they do. It's a wildly famous mathematical sequence.
each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding.
including 233, 377, and 610, which just happened to be the numbers of the safety deposit boxes that were stolen.
it's fascinating, but it's a coincidence.
it can't possibly be significant.
unless... Oh, my god.
what?
the safety deposit boxes are mine.
Cleveland, baltimore, philadelphia. Cleveland, baltimore, philadelphia.
Walter, are there any other safety deposit boxes that haven't been broken into yet?
I don't know.
I don't know where because I can't remember why I put things into the boxes.
all right, so let me get this straight.
you can remember traveling around the country 23 years ago,
renting all these safety deposit boxes under assumed names,
but you can't remember why?
the "why" is of secondary importance to "what."
what was I protecting?
whatever it was, I didn't use my usual hiding places.
so, I suspect it was something of profound significance.
well, excellent. That clears it right up.
I was under a great deal of stress at the time.
it was before the accident in the lab.
before that poor lab assistant lost her life.
I was... Distrustful of everybody.
even better, your mother, I was convinced I was being followed.
someone was watching my every move.
which medication is that, Walter?
supplements.
Walter, did you tell anybody else?
I told you, I was paranoid.
okay, get dressed. We're going out.
breakfast?
according to your travel records, in 1985, you gave a lecture at syracuse university.
now, these photos are of banks in the syracuse area.
does any of this trigger anything in your mind?
Yes, but not about banks.
think back 20 years.
imagine yourself then imaging yourself now, 20 years into the future.
in your wildest imagination, could you ever think you'd be here?
is he stoned?
just show him the other batch and be patient with him.
his mind works in a different way.
agent Dunham.
what's up?
after he split up with his wife, Raul Lugo moved to D. C.
he was an in-patient at the va there for six months, from last may to mid-october.
no visitors?
not according to the records.
I don't know what that does to your theory he was recruited there.
unless it was by another patient.
you have something?
something remarkable, actually.
when we tried to access agent Scott's hippocampus, his brain wave echo suddenly became erratic.
inconsistent in ways we've never seen.
and the cause of the inconsistency?
we managed to resolve the last image in agent scott's optic nerve before he died.
this image is linked to a second set of brain wave echoes.
agent Dunham's. They must have somehow shared consciousness.
if that's the case, it would suggest that some of John Scott's memories,
perhaps the very ones we need...
are in agent Dunham's mind.
Washington...
Hi, agent Dunham with DHS.
I'm looking for Dr. Bruce Miller?
thank you.
excuse me, Dr. Miller?
agent Olivia Dunham. I'm with DHS.
what can I do for you, agent Dunham?
I wanted to talk to you about a patient of yours, Raul Lugo.
marine force recon. History of ptsd.
as I'm sure you know, I can't violate patient confidentiality.
Raul lugo is dead, Dr. Miller, so his right to confidentiality no longer apply.
I'm investigating his death, and I need to know about his friends,
anyone he was doing therapy with or people that he got close to
if you're referring to current or former patients, those records are also protected.
unless they're involved in ongoing criminal activity,
in which case it would be your duty to release them to me.
what crimes?
I'm sorry, I'm not authorized to tell you that.
suffice to say, the team of criminals I'm investigating are all highly trained, well-skilled, and
agent Dunham, I have two dozen patients to see before I can go home to dinner.
and I'm not about to violate my ethical duty based on your say-so.
now, if you'd like to come back with a federal subpoena, I would be glad to help you out.
but until then, you'll have to excuse me.
he liked to play chess. Raul.
he used to play chess all day long.
with anyone in particular?
there were four of them. The chess club.
and do you rember their names? - Get a pencil.
let's go. Let's go. Let's move. Let's go. Door! Let's move!
robert Norton, captain, United States Air Force.
honorably discharged April of '04.
pull up his cell phone records and his financials.
see if there's anything else that ties him to Lugo.
I'm on it.
these are the va visitor logs. These men were recruited.
I want you to comb the logs and follow up on every entry.
I just talked to Evan Mcneil's wife.
says her husband's away on business.
she hasn't heard from him in two days.
well, call his work and see if they know where he is.
all right, we got something.
one of our vets bought three one-way tickets to tf green airport in providence.
when do they land?
47 minutes ago.
Hey, what's up?
we think the next bank hit is gonna go down in providence.
can you talk to walter and see if it jogs his memory?
Yeah, sure.
down strokes only. You brush with the grain.
Hey, Walter, are any of those banks you rented the safety deposit boxes in in providence?
providence? I don't believe so, no.
I'm sorry, Peter, I have tried everything to remember.
I understand how important it is, and I am quite disappointed with myself.
hold on a sec.
when she's finished chewing her cud, remember to brush her teeth.
I am not brushing a cow's teeth, Walter.
you know I have real work to do, right?
Hey, Walter. If you were gonna rent a safety deposit box in providence, what bank would you use?
providence? That would have to be the fairmont savings bank, off Westminster street.
it's the only one with safe deposit boxes big enough for my purposes.
well done, son.
the fairmont savings bank, off westminster street.
you're sure? - Oh, yeah. I'm sure.
agents, Sam Martin. Providence sac.
Francis and Dunham. So, what's our status?
all surrounding streets are locked down.
per your request, my men are checking all shared walls and alley ways.
this is Mr. Grimes, he manages the bank.
I don't understand. We've had no alarms or signs of forced entry.
well, this crew doesn't work like that, Mr. Grimes.
we have cameras, motion detectors, sensors that detect fractional variances in ambient temperature.
they might be disabling that wirelessly.
shooting you a feed back loop of old data while they stop and shop.
Oh, my god.
these four walls are internal to the bank.
I don't care how they got in here, they're still in my perimeter.
this layout's not easy.
and even if they did get through one of these walls, they've got multiple other walls on every side.
they wouldn't have time to breach them all.
what's underneath?
a basement or access tunnels?
this is the basement.
there's two feet of solid steel and then the foundation.
everything under that belongs to the city. Gas mains, sewer, electric.
sewer.
providence pd, I need the closest sewer line exit to fairmont savings bank.
let's go.
FBI! Freeze!
come on! Come on!
come on, man! Come on, you can do it! Come on!
reach out a little further!
this is francis, id number 31556.
I need a bolo on a black cargo van heading south on westminster.
license plate number 10562-sierra.
I also need ems, suspect down.
damn it! - Shut up.
scrub down and take your shots. I want this box open now.
not until you show me what this is all about.
one guy dead, another put away. For that? A camera or something? What the hell is it?
a word of advice-- don't pry into things you couldn't possibly understand.
we're on. He's coming tonight.
perfect. Very good.
I see you didn't take me up on my offer to go see my tailor.
no, I like this suit.
it's always been lucky for me.
I can appreciate that.
thank you, Mr. Kohl.
come back in the morning with the paperwork for my appeal.
6: 30 sharp?
I'll be happy to sign it then.
Oh, and wear one of your lucky suits.
will there be anything else?
as a matter of fact, yes.
I'll need my people to procure one last item.
and what would that be?
not a "what," Mr. Kohl.
in this case, a "whom."
target in sight.
we have your service record, Mr. Eastwick.
your 1040's. We know everything about you.
except what it was that you wanted so badly you'd walk through a solid wall.
Ryan Shawn Eastwick, staff sergeant, first special forces group, third battalion.
29869617.0
you're not a pow, Eastwick. You're a criminal.
look at his hands. They look a little jittery.
she's wearing him down.
no, I don't think so. That looks physiological.
call her out, would you? I got an idea.
I wasn't aware you had a background in interrogation.
I've been in rooms like that, on both sides of the table.
this will either work or it won't.
either way, it's only two minutes of your time.
we already have enough proof to put you down for armed robbery times three.
that's over 20 years in a federal prison.
do you think the prisoners there will care that you were once a hero fighting for your country?
Peter...
we lose him, we lose time. We lose everything.
look-- you're a tough guy.
I'm a tough guy. I think we can dispense with the formalities.
I'm not gonna stick a thumb in that shot-up leg of yours
because a, I think that's exactly what you expect me to do,
and b, I don't think you'd crack anyway.
no, all I want from you is to show me your hands.
right.
let me see if any of this rings a bell for you.
you've been shaking uncontrollably, you vomited at least twice in the last 10 hours,
and this morning you found hair on your pillow because it's starting to fall out.
what's wrong with me?
radiation poisoning.
right now, you're in the "walking ghost" phase,
which I suggest you enjoy 'cause it's a hell of lot better than the intestinal bleeding,
Delirium-and-coma phase you're gonna hit in a couple of days.
you violated the laws of physics, mr. Eastwick, and mother nature's a bitch.
are you a doctor?
first, I need to know what you were hired to steal.
he didn't tell us. - who's he? I need a name.
he never told us his name, all right?
we were freelance, hired out.
he equipped us, trained us.
I can tell you names of the others, but it doesn't matter anyway.
he's got everything he needs now.
everything he needs to do what?
are you gonna help me or not?
actually, Ryan, no.
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go on the other side of that glass
and I'm gonna watch you bleed out, unless you tell me everything I need to know!
I swear, I don't know what he's doing.
all I know is I overheard a phone conversation once.
he's going to a field in westford.
a field. What field? - I don't know!
look, man, you got to help me, all right?
I need some medicine, okay?
some specialist. Please. You got to help me.
there. Westford.
that's 30 square miles.
how are we gonna find one field in all of that?
wait. - What?
I know where they're going.
there's an abandoned air strip out there.
it's called little hill field.
that's the code word that joseph smith gave to david robert jones, in a case a few weeks ago.
the guy from the german prison?
it can't be a coincidence, Charlie.
it's in westford just off route three.
you come in from the west. I'll take the south.
all right. Listen up! I need every available unit for field assist!
let's move, move, move!
it's in here somewhere, what I hid in those banks.
it must be. I kept very thorough records.
unfortunately, not very organized records.
that's quite impressive.
it's a nervous tick.
which hand?
that's fantastic.
magic.
what?
you nearly died when you were a boy.
you started bruising, then your kidneys failed.
doctors didn't know what it was, the closest diagnosis was hepea.
it's a rare form of bird flu that hadn't been around for decades.
your mother was beside herself.
she stopped eating, she stopped sleeping, and I was worse.
after all, I was the scientist and here my only son was dying and I couldn't do anything about it.
Walter, I don't remember any of that.
I'd became consumed with saving you, conquering the disease.
in my research, I discovered a doctor.
alfred Gross, Swiss, brilliant physician.
he was the only man that had ever successfully cured a case of hepea.
but there was a problem. He had died in 1936.
and so, I designed a device intended to reach back into time
to cross the time-space continuum and retrieve Alfred Gross.
to bring him back with me, to fix you, my dying son.
the device, Peter, I think that's what I hid in those safe deposit boxes.
and it worked?
you were able to go back to 1936 and get this guy?
no.
before I could test it, you started to recover.
the doctor said it was a miracle.
but the science behind it, in theory, it would work.
in theory, it could retrieve anyone from anywhere.
it's charlie. I'm headed east on route three, about two miles out.
what's your 20?
I'm 10 minutes out, coming in from the south on plain.
49. 1122, 95 degrees north.
8. 916092 degrees east.
horizontal angle 33. 33 grad. We're good to go.
what time do you have?
Mr. Jones.
Mr. Kohl.
I have your appeal request all prepared and ready to go.
all I need is your signature.
1082, this is bravo team. Entering westford, pulling south on to bridge street.
target captured.
Hello?
Olivia dunham is missing.
what? What do you mean missing?
it appears she's been abducted.
need I even ask?
are you there?
Yes, yes, I'm here.
frankly, I resent the accusation.
I don't make accusations, so let me be clear.
if I find out-- - Phillip, that's enough.
you know how I feel about agent Dunham.
why would I want any harm to come to her?
now, what do we know about who may have taken her and why?
so, what does one say at a moment like this? Nice trip?
I suppose that works well enough.
I need to get into the decompression chamber.
of course. - Do you have her? Agent Dunham.
she didn't even put up a fight.
well, then let's not keep her waiting.
Walter, what are you doing?
I'm dosing a caterpillar.
dosing, as in LSD?
well, it's a special blend.
I see.
Hey, guess what just happened.
finding out that my father's giving drugs to bugs somehow just became a typical moment in my life.
it's wonderful, isn't it?
Hey, have you heard from Olivia this morning?
no, why? What's up?
she's missing.
who are you?
what do you want?
this won't take long.
I'm sure you say that to all the girls.
turn her over.
listen up. One of our own has been abducted.
Boston
the vehicle of agent Olivia Dunham was found abandoned on Graniteville road in Westford three miles northeast of little hill.
I want everyone doing everything, surveillance cameras checked, local officers and agents questioned, anyone who might have seen anything
P. D. D. W.P. A.A.A.
I don't care what acronym it is, , you talk to 'em, and you find Dunham.
for those of you new to this office, this is agent Charlie Francis.
he's my second in command.
you got anything, you come to me or him.
try not to move.
sir, did it work? - I hope so.
get my car ready. I'm going back to the office.
Yes, sir.
can please have some water?
if you're going to kill me, then can I please have some water?
please.
I need to-- I need to sit up.
please.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
thank you.
and pull agents from Albany, Mr. Clark, and get them to Boston, or do I need to remind you how I started this conversation?
I have a Sanford Harris, line six.
just get it done.
Sanford. Listen, we, uh
we're having something of a crisis here.
Yeah, well, your crisis is why I'm calling.
look, Phillip, we go back too far.
I say something diplomatic, you'll see through it before the end of my sentence.
you're calling about Olivia Dunham?
I'm calling about fringe division.
internal affairs is sending me in to do a full review of your office, make sure things are running as they should.
I just wanted you to hear it from me.
this is agent Dunham. I need to speak to Broyles.
what the hell happened to you?
I'm in Watertown.
there was a building that we need to raid.
I need agents, maybe 20.
have them meet me in 30 minutes at the end of Tcott street.
are you okay?
not yet, I'm not.
the building I was being held at is two miles
hands behind your head and drop to the floor.
Where's Broyles? - Do it!
what's going on here?
quite day, agent Dunham.
Oh, yeah. You're in Boston hospital.
you probably didn't think you'd see me again so soon.
don't take this the wrong way, Mr. Harris, but, uh, - I don't think about you all too often. - Really?
well, you must get some satisfaction from what you did to me.
my conviction wasn't a point of pride for you?
why am I cuffed to the bed?
because this is the kind of authority that I have here.
you see, my conviction on sexual assault was overturned.
and homeland security, for whom I consult, has assigned me to review fringe division.
just like that?
which gives me the prerogative to question your sanity, your loyalty, your worthiness to serve.
and it seems to me the people you surround yourself with have failed those tests at every turn.
beginning with your former partner...
and lover, John Scott.
an agent who betrayed you and who turned out to be a traitor against this country, a traitor whose life you went to considerable lengths to save.
if you're suggesting that I know anything about
you went to Iraq to recruit a man to help you save agent Scott's life.
Peter Bishop, arrested seven times.
I needed Peter.
to assist you in freeing his father from a mental institution.
Walter Bishop, who was sent to St. Claire's because he was deemed unfit to stand trial for manslaughter, a man who spent most of his adult years running questionable scientific experiments on human subjects.
he's out of his mind, miss Dunham.
these are the people you surround yourself with.
a traitor, a criminal, and a lunatic.
what does that say about you?
am I under arrest?
it goes without saying that you are not to investigate your own abduction.
understood?
are you okay? - Yep.
Hey, Liv, you know I had nothing to do with the way you were taken in, right?
Yeah, I know that.
that son of a bitch Harris, he molested three women.
I put him away, and that's what this is about.
I am not gonna ask him for a thing.
I'm gonna go to that building myself.
we sent a team to the address, to the building where you were being held.
it was empty. There was nothing there.
what about the phone I got? The car I took?
the cell phone? - They're clean.
the only prints were yours.
Oh, there's something else.
there's a woman here to see you--Rachel.
she says that you're expecting her. Who is she?
she's my sister.
Oh, oh, you look great. - I don't really.
come on, you do. - I don't.
you're always so hard on yourself. - I know, whatever. Thank you.
you are just a giant person.
Hey, aunt Olivia. - Hello.
when did you get so big?
what happened to your face?
Oh, it's, um, a scratch.
I brought this for you.
she wanted to bring you something from her room.
I have really, really needed one of these. Thank you so much.
are you sure you're okay?
it's a long story. I, uh-- I'm working on a case.
go, go, we're good.
is it okay if we still stay with you tonight?
cause if it's not okay-- - yeah, yeah. No, of course.
I'll meet you back here at 5: 00. - Perfect.
go, save the world. - All right.
I love you.
I'll see you at 5: 00. - Thank you so much.
Bye.
hello. - Peter, it's me.
Olivia, thank god. Are you okay? How are you? Where are u?
I'm on my way to you. So can you meet me outside in ten minutes?
and bring your father. I think we'll need him.
do I have to?
harvard
they--they gave me a spinal tap.
they put electrodes or sensors on my head.
why would they do that? I mean, what would they want with me?
what were they doing? Who could they be?
you're like the question machine.
and there was nothing there when they checked the building?
no. They'd cleared the building.
but I took something before I left, something from one of their labs, and I hid it to keep it safe.
what was it?
Walter, can you identify what it is?
Yes. I'm afraid I can.
which means if your high school bio teacher told you that humans sit at the top of the food chain, he or she was dead wrong.
literally millions and millions of organisms feed on us, reproduce within us.
viruses, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi
the four musketeers of the pathogenic world.
Dr. Kinberg?
Dr. Kinberg? Somebody call an ambulance.
someone help him.
but there's been an event that deserves our attention.
internal hemorrhaging.
rapid cell deterioration.
it appears that he suffocated from within.
well, maybe that's 'cause a giant, slimy, spiky slug came out of his mouth.
Yes.
and I have a theory as to what it might have been.
I'm sure you do. Care you share?
eventually. - Peter, anything?
no, it always takes a second for the thermal cameras to calibrate.
what do we know about our guy?
only what I was told outside.
his name's Miles Kinberg, immunologist, cutting edge work, an expert in his field.
that's all I know.
whatever it was, it ripped through his esophagus on the way out.
at least he died teaching, a righteous profession.
hold on a sec.
I got it.
stay there.
right there. Right there, right there.
look. Simian hemorrhagic fever.
the infected cells have a definitive spiderweb look.
makes HIV look like a common cold by comparison.
Ebola.
Walter, please.
no time for the immune response.
I lost it.
what do you mean you lost it?
either it can vanish or it's fast.
it's really fast. There.
cover the doors! - it's going down.
there!
get it! - There! There!
get it, get it. Get it.
things like this used to happen in the lab all the time.
makes me nostalgic.
spirited, isn't it?
well, have you considered, I don't know, killing it?
we can always kill it, son.
we can't always bring it back.
you probably could.
that is true.
do you know what I could go for?
don't say food.
Cheesesteak.
how can he even think about eating?
I know. It's disgusting, ri and yet...
ha, you want one too?
extra provolone, please.
like father like son.
Oh, come on, don't say that.
my theory is correct. I knew it.
this organism was developed from the same material that Olivia stole from her captors.
we must let her know.
you sure?
my boy, I'm not even sure that we all exist on the same plane of consciousness.
but yes, I believe so.
I've been briefed on how you brought in Olivia Dunham.
Oh, I had reason to suspect she might be dangerous.
I agreed to let you question her, not treat her like a rabid dog.
what you did was unacceptable.
Dunham's been nothing but an exemplary agent, and this is my office.
well, then you need to be corrected on two counts.
the jury's out on Dunham.
I'm not convinced she's the superstar you claim she is.
how could you be? You're on a vendetta against her.
secondly, while I'm here on active investigation, this division is under my purview.
active investigation?
this morning it was a review.
well, the pentagon is concerned, Phillip.
well, think of how this office was thrown together.
flight 627 lands, and suddenly you're in charge of two dozen agents?
somehow I think none of that's the reason you're here.
this isn't a witch hunt.
I'm not here to punish some J. V.Agent who tried to ruin my life for chasing a little tail.
I'm here to do my job.
why don't you do the same?
Boston did you see anyone unusual? Anyone in your class?
no.
and did he mention anything to you? Anything in private?
why would he?
cause you were his teacher's assistant.
I thought that he might have mentioned if something unusual had happened.
no, he didn'T. Nothing.
we've been trying to track Kinberg's whereabouts over the past week.
we spoke to his wife, and she said that he had arrived home just before midnight the last two nights.
but according to his schedule, his last class started at 6: 00.
he's had extended office hours this week.
well, could I get a list of the students he talked to?
it was drop-in. I'm not really sure.
I'm sorry.
after what happened today, I feel like nothing's real.
that was crazy.
how long were you seeing him?
professor Kinberg.
three months.
I knew he was gonna take the job.
he hadn't even told his wife about it yet.
what job was that?
I shouldn't. He wasn't supposed to tell me.
it's okay.
the C.D.C. Centers for disease control.
they offered him this big job, which meant moving to Atlanta.
so I figured that was gonna be for us.
and what exactly was the job?
task force to oversee the country's preparedness to fight off an epidemic.
it sounded like a big deal.
can I come in?
I hate that-- knocking and asking while you're coming in.
Dr. Kinberg, the professor who died at Boston College, was offered a job at the C.D.C. To co-chair a classified task force whose sole responsibility was to respond to epidemics.
And?
he wasn't the only scientist asked.
there was another one-- Dr. Russell Simon from Cambridge.
I'm trying to locate him now.
what, you think he's a target too?
I do.
and I also think that the people who killed Kinberg are the same people who took me.
and how'd you make that leap?
Walter, he thinks the thing that killed Dr. Kinberg is genetically similar to some evidence that
I grabbed from the people who abducted me.
but why abduct you? What's the link? And why kill kinberg like that?
I don't know yet.
but so far I figured why kill an epidemiologist unless you're looking to start an epidemic?
get rid of the firefighter before you start a fire.
and why am I just now hearing of this?
because your friend Sanford Harris forbade me from investigating my own abduction.
he's put everything on hold.
has requested that I run all operations past him before we move.
is that even possible?
apparently.
sir, I'm asking you to save a man's life.
are you telling me that you don't have the authority to let me do my job?
find Simon. Get him in protective custody now.
thank you.
I'll handle Harris. - I know you will.
Hey, Rach, it's me. Can we just meet at the apartment? Is that okay?
Yeah, sure. I have the key. Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I won't be too late.
and if you get hungry, there's food in the fridge, or there are some menus by the phone in the kitchen if you want to order in.
don't worry about us at all. Ella's having a blast.
okay, I'll see you tonight. I love you.
you too.
I'm going to Cambridge to pick up Russell Simon.
who's that?
a man we're taking into protective custody. I'll give you the details on the way.
Oh, I'm going with you? - Yeah.
meet you downstairs.
Hey, Mitch.
listen, Olivia, your abduction.
I'm gonna coordinate the investigation.
I assume everything you remember is already your debrief.
Yeah.
if I find anything, I'll let you know. We'll find 'em.
that's great, Mitch. Thank you.
thank you so much, Dr. Simon, for cooperating.
I suppose I should be thanking you.
FBI tells you they're here to save your life, you listen.
well, I know it must be confusing.
well, it's certainly shocking.
miles was a dear friend.
I am sorry.
know that we're doing everything we can to bring those responsible to justice.
the C.D.C. Wasn't expecting me for three months.
who else knew you were planning on taking this job?
well, no one. Just my wife.
I was instructed not to tell anyone.
and is there anyone you can think of who might be targeting you?
maybe students whose grades they might have felt were undeserved.
will you excuse us for a moment? I need to talk to my agents.
sure.
can you give us a minute?
so I understand that you have requested placing Dr. Simon in protective custody.
I believe that his life may be in danger.
Yeah, well, that's taxpayer dollars, miss Dunham, and I haven't approved that.
let me ask you a question.
not that I don't enjoy having you here, but how long are you planning on sticking around?
until I have made a full assessment of how this office conducts its business.
did Broyles approve your request?
no, he did not.
Mr. Harris, you don't like me, you don't respect me, and you think I'm bad at my job.
but please, don't let that get in the way of doing the right thing.
that man in there may likely die if we don't keep him safe.
I'm not asking you to like me.
I'm asking you to do the right thing.
Yeah, we'll keep him safe.
thank you.
this is Dunham.
Walter's still trying to determine what that thing is that came out of Kinberg.
but I think we made a breakthrough.
okay, so what is it?
it seems to be activated by a liquid.
what does? The parasite?
the yellow powdery stuff in the vials that you stole, they're like eggs, but the catalyst is stomach acid.
so the victim just needs to ingest it?
exactly right, and then it grows--fast.
thank you. - No problem.
and is there any way to trace it, where it came from?
Walter doesn't seem to think so, no.
Dr. Simon, with your permission, I'd like to take you to our field office.
we'll debrief you, go over your options.
then we'll move you to a safe house. You okay?
Yeah.
there'll be agents there on call 24 hours a day.
breathe.
this is agent Francis. I need medical attention in room six.
I called medical assistance.
Oh, my god.
it's viral.
Nasopharyngitis, albeit a gargantuan specimen.
What--what does that mean?
this organism is a single specimen of a virus for the common cold.
so you're saying that this is one single cell?
it's not unprecedented.
the ostrich egg is a single cell, and it can grow up to five pounds.
they supersized the common cold, which, as it turns out, is disgusting.
obviously somebody's playing with us.
Yeah, they're showing off.
killing epidemiologists with the common cold.
it is impressive.
what I want to know is what they wanted from you.
Oh, who cares about me? I want to know who's next.
I care about you.
if we can figure out why they needed you, then maybe we can figure out who's next.
well, I'm gonna keep looking for someone who's connected to Kinberg and Simon.
she is beautiful, isn't she?
who?
the slug.
you know, I could have cooked for you.
uh, no, thanks. I've tasted your cooking.
Hey, I've gotten really good, you know.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah. No, I haven't.
I didn't think so.
hard day?
uh, I honestly wouldn't know what to tell you.
and if I did, it would be a felony.
you have a crazy job.
Yeah, I have a crazy job. Cheers.
Cheers.
have you heard from Greg?
I don't know how to do this alone.
Ella is beautiful, and smart, and strong, and she gets that from you.
me? No. You've always been the strong one, you have.
I've only done one thing right in my life.
then you need to be strong for her.
whatever you need, I'm here.
and you guys can stay here as long as you want.
thank you.
is there something else?
anything you're not telling me?
no. No, there's nothing.
how goes it?
horrible.
we'll find 'em, whoever's responsible for what happened.
maybe this'll help.
I need to talk to you.
Charlie, I think I know who killed Simon.
and I think it's the same person who abducted me.
who?
don't ask me how I know. I'll tell you later.
Livvy, that can't be right.
it is. And I can prove it.
but I've got Harris watching me like a prison guard.
I can't do this myself.
what do you need?
loeb Walter, is that LSD?
LSD, why would I-- it's a decongestant.
she is a giant cold virus after all.
right.
Peter. You got a moment?
what's up?
Olivia may have a lead on who abducted her.
only she can't pursue it without some help.
I can't help her.
why not?
suffice it to say that sometimes a problem with being in law enforcement is that you gotta obey the law yourself.
and you think I'm the guy to break the law for you?
I'm sorry, I didn't-- - no, look, you're right.
I am the guy to break the law for you.
what do we need?
I need a wiretap.
on who?
Mitchell Loeb. FBI.
Hello?
Olivia, hi.
I was just in Marlborough.
I thought I'd drop by and check to see if you're okay.
I don't understand.
I don't know. I guess I hadn't talked to you since Mitchell's surgery.
well, how sweet of you.
would you like to come inside?
have a cup of tea?
Yeah, thank you.
I've been thinking a lot about you and everything that you and Mitchell went through.
it's really lovely having him back at the office.
Oh, yes, he's really glad to be back.
his recovery seemed to go smoothly.
what were you doing in Marlborough?
I'm working on a case.
well, what's the case?
suspicion of a double agent.
excuse me.
I'll get the tea.
mind if I use your bathroom?
it's down the hall. - Thank you.
Kyle. - Hey, man.
can you grab me that phone?
all right, go ahead.
okay, so I enter the phone number and then just punch in that code?
Kyle, you are the greatest, man. Have I told you that lately?
Yeah, thanks. You too.
he used to work at the phone company, but I never really understood why.
the guy's a genius. - Yeah, right.
wouldn't want to waste any of that potential.
he tapped into the Loebs' home phone number.
we should be able to pick up any outgoing calls they make from their house.
this is Mitchell.
Olivia Dunham is in our house. - Why?
she claims she was here to check on you.
is it working?
no.
Hey, Kyle, it's not working. All I'm getting is buzz. I don't hear anything.
I think she knows.
I don't know how she could.
I don't know what to do.
well, I do. And you have to move fast.
you need to kill her. Right now.
her office might know that she's here. How can I just
Dunham's already under suspicion for being unstable.
they think she's dangerous.
all right, I'll try it again.
we can say she came after you, that it was self-defense.
there has to be another way to do this.
there isn't, honey. There's one way.
you cannot let Dunham leave there alive.
in the entry closet, top shelf, in the back, there's a gun.
contact me when it's done.
what is it?
Olivia's in trouble. - What happened?
hold on a second.
come on, pick up, pick up.
it's me. - Get out of the house. She's gonna kill you.
what?
Samantha Loeb is going to kill you. Get out of the house right now.
tea's ready.
turn around and put the gun on the ground.
put the gun down.
now get down on the ground.
please, don't hurt me.
get on the ground, Samantha.
I was just doing-- - Samantha, get down on the ground now.
I don't want to shoot you, but I will. What are you gonna do to me?
are you gonna hurt me?
damn it, Samantha, shut the hell up and get down on the ground.
don't do it. - Please get down!
there's nothing here.
loeb knew he was gonna cut and run.
based on what you've found, you have nothing to trace.
no, nothing yet.
I'll need more time to trace the origin of the virus, but even then it will be impossible to know the exact origin.
Liv, I hate to even ask you this.
anything you remember from when they had you?
no, there's nothing that I heard, nothing that I remember.
there's no other way to track Loeb's cell phone?
tech services tried everything.
wait a minute, not everything.
they agents at Loeb's house, they're surveilling the area, right?
no sign of Loeb? - Not yet.
so he doesn't know about his wife.
no, he doesn'T.
meaning that she could still contact him.
I'm ahead of you. I'll get a team.
what happened? I missed it.
okay, we need Samantha Loeb's cell phone.
I think inventory has it. - I'm on it.
nice work. - Thanks.
go TO
it's all rather tense, isn't it?
he's gonna come.
assuming, of course, they text each other.
do you see him yet?
no, not yet.
Peter was really worried about you when you were gone.
Walter. - You were.
well, of course I was worried. - He was really worried.
we got him.
okay, you stay here.
Mitchell, put it down! Put it down!
Freeze!
drop it. Drop your weapon.
you're under arrest.
nice work.
thank you.
who are you working for?
don't be an idiot, Loeb.
this is your one chance to cooperate.
I'd say to you that you have no idea how hard we're gonna come down on you, except you do.
I want to see my wife.
you're not getting a thing until you talk.
then you're outta luck.
why'd you kill them, Kinberg and Simon?
any why like that? I mean, there are easier ways to take somebody out.
you're getting nothing.
she can't do it.
she won't get a confession.
I'd say the evidence in his house is plenty.
well, I'd say evidence is no confession.
ask as many questions as you want.
why take me?
and that spinal tap, what did you want?
loeb, this is your last chance to cooperate.
or what, you'll torture me?
can you leave me alone with him?
what's she doing?
you want your wife, Mitch?
Yeah, Olivia, I do.
okay.
okay.
and do you want to know who pulled the trigger?
you're looking at her.
did you kill them?
did you? - Yes!
do you not understand the rules?
what we're up against?
who the two sides are?
tell me at least you know that. - Who's we?
we had a plan here, lady.
we had a shot.
and you just blew it.
why did you kidnap me?
kidnap you? Idiot.
we saved you.
saved me from what?
we were going to let you go. We saved you.
you-- you have no idea what you've done.
not a clue.
there's your confession.
you need to get some rest.
I think you've earned it.
I'll see you tomorrow. Thank you.
thank you.
he's right. You should get home.
what did he mean he saved me? What the hell was that?
he was messing with you.
well, I don't know. I mean, did you see him?
there was something about the way he said that.
the man's insane, Olivia.
I concur, and in the category of takes one to know one...
that man did seem disturbed.
but then why take me?
because they wanted to hurt you.
they knew that you were investigating them. They wanted to take you out.
then why not just kill me?
you're talking about a man who infects people with giant viruses.
if you hadn't escaped, he knows what they would have done to you.
listen to me, you'd just told him that you killed his wife.
he said that to you to try and get a reaction out of you, to get to you.
let it go.
you got his confession.
go home.
I was worried, too, when you were taken.
thank you, Walter.
not as much as him, of course.
Walter. - It's true.
we will be coming through with Hazas which are available for purchase for 4 dollars.
and of course exact change's always appreciated.
you should put keys on your back.
excuse me?
it's an old wive's tale to stop the bloody nose.
yeah?
actually, I tried it once.
it doesn't work.
it's all bull.
excuse me.
excuse me.
excuse me, I need to talk to you.
Yes, sir, I'll be with you in one moment.
no, now!
please.
I'll be right back.
what's the problem? - I'm in trouble.
there's something happening to me, that I don't have the time or permission to explain to you. - What is it?
you need to listen to me very carefully.
I need you to go to the passengers,
I need you to collect as many sedatives or tranquilizers as you can.
okay, sir, I need you to take a deep breath.
this isn't a panic attack.
this is real.
we will die, all of us, if you don't do what I say.
sir, a threat like that is in violation of FAA...
do I look to you like I care about that?
Oh, my God.
I need you to get those drugs for me.
do you have any weapons, a gun?
go call the captain.
sir, I'm going to need you to calm down.
you're going to scare the passengers.
they should be scared. What weapons do you have?
Yeah, it's Melissa.
what weapons?
we have a man here, who's claiming to be in...
we have a Taser in the cockpit, which I will use on you if you don't calm down.
taser won't do a thing. It'll just piss me off.
he wants drugs, but he seems to be on something already.
I need you to do what I say.
I'm going into that bathroom.
you keep me in there. You keep that door closed.
get whatever sedatives you can as soon as you can.
you can go in that bathroom, sir.
I am not messing around!
