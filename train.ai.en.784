this cord is actually a hanging rope from England circa 1650.
in those days when sentenced to death, nobles often chose a silk cord rather than rough hempen rope.
it'd be cool to know who else might've died on this cord.
if it came from the vault, the cord probably can't lead us to the murderer.
au contraire.
the killer left DNA.
in order to hoist Aldridge, the killer wrapped the cord around his forearm and pulled.
Ouch.
he left some skin behind?
Yeah, and hair.
nice job, Hodgins.
we find the guy, we can do a DNA match.
king of the lab.
the skeletal muscles are pulling away from the bone.
what's his potassium level?
uh... blood serum contains ten milligrams per 100 milliliters.
elevated, but non-fatal.
it's odd, though, because his kidneys were healthy, no signs of Addison's or any medication.
succinylcholine.
a muscle relaxant? In high doses, it stops the heart and lungs.
right.
the body turns succinylcholine into potassium, which occurs naturally in the body, so it's not detected as a toxin.
succinylcholine is one of the earliest anesthetics known to man.
guess how I know that.
I read Dr. Reardon's book, too.
why are you here?
I'm just waiting for Cam to finish cutting up Aldridge.
she's done.
why are you here in my area?
cam's sister kissed me.
dude...
don't call me "dude." All right, listen,
I was supposed to be Cam's boyfriend, but only between the hours of 6: 30 and 10: 00.
she kissed me at 6: 20, so technically, that doesn't even count.
I can went to her office to get something, Felicia, she just grabbed me and planted one on me.
I didn't even see it coming.
I didn't even have a defense maneuver planned.
Oh, wow.
all right, all right, uh... how are you, uh...
how are you gonna break it to Cam? What?
why would I do that?
you want her to find out from her sister?
wow, this is worse than when we were a couple.
sorry.
I really should take my gun out and shoot you now.
I'm sorry, man. No, it's serious.
you're not helping.
look, I have a son.
if I thought someone hurt him,
I'd want to hang him.
I didn't kill Kyle Aldridge.
he was a political enemy who slept with your daughter then killed her after she threatened to tell his wife.
juries understand situations like that.
there's no proof Kyle Aldridge killed my daughter.
do you need proof? Yes. And for a jury to be sympathetic to me, they'd need proof as well.
do you have that proof, Agent Booth?
Aldridge didn't die from hanging.
succinylcholine poisoning can't be proven.
right.
nobody knows that better than you.
you literally wrote the book on it, Doc.
so...
can you roll up your sleeves, please?
this is a sample of 800-year-old bronze.
why am I interested in that?
because we found a fragment of 800-year-old copper in Kristen Reardon.
different metals, right.
copper is an ingredient in bronze.
and when Angela accused me of being Gormogon, it started me thinking.
angela accused you of being Gormogon?
it started me thinking that you and Booth could be right.
I am not Gormogon.
booth and I could be right about what?
I put the serial killer in the vault out of my mind and started considering
Kristen's murder as its own singular occurrence... what?
from the outside, you are a pretty good candidate to be Gormogon.
it's possible that the copper in Kristen's wound was unalloyed chip from a larger piece of bronze.
like a chocolate chip that didn't melt in the cake mix.
and the Jeffersonian's full of bronze weapons.
none of which are in Gormogon's vault.
are you able to match a bronze weapon to a copper fragment?
theoretically.
but it would take about 200 years to test every bronze weapon in the Jeffersonian.
I might be able to help with that.
I worked up a 3-D model of Kristen's murder, and I noticed something.
this is Kristen.
the angle of attack was exactly 67 degrees.
as you can see, the weapon went right through her.
which is weird.
Why? We've been assuming that Kristen was stabbed.
someone would have to be awfully tall to stab downward at that angle.
and incredibly strong.
six foot eight and 300 pounds.
no one at the Jeffersonian looks like that.
it'd be pretty tough for someone like that to sneak in.
another explanation?
projectile. Blood stain analysis indicates Kristen was killed on Aldridge's work table.
and there's no evidence on the surface suggesting that a projectile exited Kristen's body and struck the table.
but...
Kristen was impaled?
like a piece of paper on a message spike.
visualize a sharp object on the table at a fixed 67-degree angle.
the object impales Kristen through the posterior thorax.
exits her anterior thorax.
still at a 67-degree angle.
the only rational conclusion is the death itself was accidental.
Dr. Aldridge gets in a tiff with his young girlfriend.
she pulls out her phone, threatens to call his wife.
they argue, Aldridge reaches for the phone, the girl falls back onto the table.
if you call Aldridge by his name, you really should call "the girl" by her name.
at which point, he panics and throw Ms. Reardon down the incinerator chute.
overcome with remorse, he arranges to meet with the federal attorney to confess, but before he can do that, guilt destroys him.
he hangs himself in the vault, symbolically aligning himself with the serial killer.
whoa, Dr. Bancroft.
Aldridge arranged to meet the federal attorney?
through the Jeffersonian in-house counsel.
most likely to confess.
why didn't he just confess during Dr. Brennan's interrogation?
the guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed.
and extreme fear "can neither fight nor fly, but coward-like with trembling terror die.
unfortunately for Mr. Shakespeare,
Dr. Aldridge didn't actually commit suicide.
he died of succinylcholine poison.
it's my understanding that that can't be proven.
at least not to court standards.
I think you'll find that my explanation will satisfy any inquest inquiry.
Dr. Bancroft, it's our professional opinion here in the forensics lab, that Dr. Aldridge was murdered.
fine. Prove it.
but watch your backs.
because if I'm wrong and you're right, that means there's still a serial killer out there.
and if I were the killer, you'd be next, Ms. Montenegro.
why me?
well, you identified the Reardon girl, you figured out this hologramatic impalement scenario.
be careful.
I feel like I was just threatened.
check every bronze weapon in the Jeffersonian that matches Angela's criteria.
none are consistent with the fragment removed from Kristen????
well, obviously we're looking for a weapon that was smuggled in.
okay, what were those noises?
there is no way to smuggle an 800-year-old bronze weapon into the Jeffersonian. No, we have X-rays, guards, metal detectors.
you come in with anything bigger than a watch, they search you.
you two are geniuses-- how would you do it?
its absolutely impossible.
unless you mail it.
Oh, yeah, right, there's that.
What?!
if you mail something to the Jeffersonian, it doesn't need to be cleared by customs or security.
okay, you're saying if I want to get a stolen artifact into the United States, all I have to do is mail it to the Jeffersonian?
technically yes, but the fact is, we check and report all items to the government.
okay, who's "we"?
the Authentications Department.
Oh, okay, you mean a bunch of starving interns who work here during the summer.
interns keep detailed records of every item they authenticate.
access Kristen Reardon's log.
I suppose Gormogon could have mailed himself to the Jeffersonian, stole an I. D. and simply walked out.
this had nothing to do with Goobagon. Gormogon.
whatever. How many times do I have to say that?
I don't have the necessary clearance.
let me try.
neither do I.
excuse me.
wait, you have a password?
Yeah, Cam's.
what? She won't mind.
Kristen Reardon worked on a lot of 16th-century Baroque wood carvings.
I know your password, too.
it's "daffodil.
I never told you that.
what? I got eyes.
I mean, you guys aren't exactly CIA material.
Daffodil?
what? They're pretty.
looks like Kristen might have worked on some
Luristan bronzes.
any from the 13th century?
Yeah, tools, utensils, sculptures...
what's Luristan?
Persia... You mean Iran? Or Iraq?
since the war, Iraqi museums have been looted, and their pieces are being sold on the black market.
this murder has nothing to do with the vault or a serial killer.
Kristen Reardon was a smuggler?
more than likely killed by a smuggler.
she goes to report something and the smuggler kills her.
I'll have Zack to examine the objects to see if it was possible to find the weapon？
and I'm changing my password.
Daisy?
how did you know?
it's your second favorite flower.
I know you, Bones.
try a planet.
Jupiter.
Hey. Hey.
I owe you. No, you don't.
I do.
it took the pressure off.
I even reconnected with Felicia.
she kissed me.
what? I swear I didn't see it coming.
she just planted it on me.
like a peck on the cheek, or the full meal?
why does that even matter?
full meal.
I don't believe it.
what's the big deal?
I mean, you and I aren't actually, you know, going out.
she thought she stole you away from me, that's why she was so nice.
you.
what?
you kissed back.
no, no, no, there was no "kiss back.
you know, my lips, they may have parted for a second...
Hi, ready for lunch? Hi.
don't say hello to her.
how could you make a move on my boyfriend?
he said things weren't so great between you guys.
you didn't think you should ask me first?
sorry, didn't seem he was all that into you.
time out. Let's get real here, okay?
you are actually fighting over something that does not even exist.
what?
we don't go out anymore. We broke up a long time ago.
and you brought him for Dad so he'd still think...
you know how Dad is-- I'd never hear the end of it.
you saw how he lit up when he got that remote.
it can handle up to eight different devices...
we know, Booth.
why didn't you tell me you guys split up?
you want him, take him. I don't care.
I don't want him. You don't?
no, I was just trying to get back at you for being so perfect all the time. So you admit it.
like you're a saint.
she used to go into my closet with all my dolls and say that they were having a party, but I wasn't invited.
you were five, and they did not like you.
typical. Start a fight so we miss lunch.
Oh, you made reservations? I'm surprised.
I thought we'd have to eat from a cart on the street.
wow, you two can have lunch after all this?
please. Like you can ruin a meal?
okay, that's it.
I don't know who you think...
don't raise your voice to her, Seeley.
what?
let's go. Let him calm down.
Wow.
why did you guys break up? What did he do?
it wasn't me. I...
this is the most likely murder weapon.
it's an antelope.
actually, it's a oryx.
that's a type of antelope.
I was being precise.
you used to appreciate that.
67 degrees. Exactly.
oryx on table, struggle,
Kristen Reardon is impaled on the oryx.
good work, Zack.
let's swab the sculpture, see if there's any DNA evidence.
it's not here.
what do you mean it's not here anymore?
according to Jeffersonian records, the oryx was mailed to Box 99,
poplar Street Post Office in Arlington.
the Jeffersonian is being used to smuggle Iraqi artifacts?
has the FBI been informed about this?
Yes, Dr. Bancroft.
agent Booth and Dr. Brennan are trying to arrange to have the post office staked out by tomorrow.
it's Cam.
I told him. You were right.
he wasn't happy when I said the FBI already knew.
Thanks, Cam. Now let's see if he's a part of it, or just another ass-covering bureaucrat.
good hunting.
little game there, Bones
who shows up for the Iraqi Bambi?
there are a number of possible candidates.
come on, I mean it's a stakeout.
play with me. Speculate.
my money's on Bancroft.
the head of the Jeffersonian? Why?
he's a dill weed.
you think he's a murderer just because you don't like him?
bones, it's a game.
well, there's no way it's Bancroft.
he has a doctorate.
Dr. Kevorkian has a doctorate.
Oh. So does that guy.
Dr. Klimkew.
during a murder investigation, you uncovered my smuggling operation?
Yep.
man, that is bad, bad luck.
what about the murders, Evan?
Kristen Reardon and Kyle Aldridge?
no, I'm afraid that their deaths are on your hands.
how do you figure?
this silver skeleton Gormogon serial killer is obviously involved.
you brought him into our house.
no, I can only take responsibility for smuggling this oryx into the country.
get your hands off the murder weapon.
we know what happened.
I was there.
but it wasn't me who pushed Kristen onto that table.
it was Aldridge.
now... why would he do that?
uh, love gone wrong,
I don't know, but Aldridge said that if I didn't help him dispose of the body, he'd expose my smuggling deal and I would go to prison.
well, that's it then, huh, Bones? Case closed.
wait. Well, except...
somebody killed Kyle Aldridge.
Oh, he hanged himself.
ow, ow.
rope burns.
look at that.
well, we think you killed Kristen Reardon...
probably by accident.
we know you killed Kyle Aldridge.
premeditated.
and I'm confident we can prove it beyond reasonable doubt to a jury.
it's over, Evan.
do either of you know a good lawyer?
okay, don't take it so hard.
I'm not taking anything hard.
what are we, Russian?
Nostrovia. Yeah.
I'll tell you what else I know.
what you're taking hard is the fact that it happened in your house.
it's not my house.
not where you sleep, okay?
your favorite place-- the house of reason
Oh, it's not my favorite place.
Yes, it is.
what? No, it's no...How do you know?
daffodil.
Daisy.
Jupiter.
okay. I'll tell you what else I know.
you were hoping that it was Gorgonzola.
Gormogon. Ah!
so you admit it.
but accidentally.
does... does that count? Yes.
look, all the scientists and the squints and the eggheads, they wanted it to be a serial killer, so it wouldn't be one of them.
them? You.
me? One of you.
you were all offended that it was one of you.
you know what?
I am offended.
I just said that.
I'm offended, because...
...because, I...
because you were betrayed by one of your own.
Yes.
are you going to betray me?
no.
nonetheless, I shall be vigilant.
Nonetheless?
I'm not going to have a headache tomorrow, am I?
well, we're going to find out.
Hodgins and Zack-- they do their experiments, we do ours.
to Gargonzola. Gormogon.
you missed.
our time capsule was buried in 1987.
the year the DOW closed above 2000 for the first time.
reagan told Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall.
you had a huge crush on LaToya Jackson.
I did.
you can't complain, Stinson.
you married the head cheerleader.
lucky I did.
and now we have a wonderful kid who's a senior, right here at Foothill.
Alex, take a bow.
anyhow, we're here today to open the time capsule that we buried 20 years ago, so we can see who we were and how the heck we all got to where we are today.
found it!
twenty years...
do you even remember what you put in there?
no. A bad perm and pink leg warmers, probably.
here we go!
God! That is vile!
Oh, what the hell, Bill?
I thought you said the thing was watertight?
it should've been, and it's Gil, not Bill.
let's see what we've got here.
what is it?!
Wow! Now this is a sweet field.
this is what I'm talking about.
right? I mean, it's nothing like ours, but, hey, that didn't stop me from being MVP my senior year.
got the trophy, touchdown!
in certain tribes, in the African subcontinent, piercings serve as a reminder, like your trophy, of the power and agility, which has since faded away.
what do you mean, fade away?
o Whoa! Timeout.
can we just concentrate on the case? What do we got here?
we were all gathered for the opening. We had no idea that that thing was in there.
Whoa!
that is rank.
I was just expecting to see my 10, 000 Maniacs album.
that was not there. Who are you?
I'm Gil Bates. I sealed it myself.
I used a propylene seal and industrial bolt lags.
adolescent, Caucasian male, late teens, early 20s.
all right, so, what do you say we just pack it all up and ship it back to the Jeffersonian?
Oh, I'm sorry. That's not a good idea.
you see, the water has compromised the structural integrity of the case, so...
well, will you look at this, Bones. Another nerd for your squint squad.
drill.
drill? Whoa, wait a second. You're going to drill it right here? What about taking it all back to Jeffersonian?
tub.
a 1987 Foothill High School yearbook, of course.
how about th-the ghetto blaster?
Whoo! Yeah!
Rubik's Cube?
how about this? CD, no needle required.
in 20 years, they'll be able to put hundreds of those on a microchip.
victim had several antemortem fractures to his sternum, as well as several antemortem fractures to the lateral sections of his ribs.
all healed?
all healed at different times.
I had a Michael Jackson glove.
I've never mentioned that before.
I loved Chevy Chase.
we all have our crosses to bear.
the fracture on the right clavicle is fresh.
well, was, 20 years ago.
mullet alert!
Ooh, that's a nasty one.
booth got a list of all the students who didn't make it to the capsule opening, and he's pulling the names of anyone connected to the school in 1987 who had a record.
Oh, my God, I'm getting flashbacks to braces and stirrup pants and a really, really bad side ponytail.
you certainly grew out of it.
I wore Doc Marten's that weighed more than I did.
apparently Booth was fine. He was a football player.
right. He was one of those guys.
well, this guy certainly wasn't hanging out with the cheerleaders, but I bet he had some love notes stashed away in his Spaceballs binder.
I think I saw him in the video.
Roger Dillon.
class of 1987.
here he is.
the comet will be around in 76 years. We'll still be around, don't worry.
how did Roger Dillon get from there..
to here?
I ran a sample of the sludge.
organic matter.
or you could call him "Roger."
Oh, come on, when you can ladle someone, he's a little less than a person, don't you think?
fine. I took a sample of Roger, ran it through the mass spectrometer.
you'll never guess what I found.
traces of an unidentified organophosphate.
nerve gas? Very good.
I'll break down the rest chemicals now.
the victim also had a peri-mortem fracture in his wrist.
there are indications of a grade-two acromioclavicular joint separation.
but it was certainly not lethal.
I've seen it before. Someone twisted the victim's arm behind his back, forcefully.
so, what, he got beat up for his lunch money?
violent students are the hallmark of a schoolyard.
I speak from experience.
however, these fractures on his ribs might predate high school.
so... he might've had some trouble at home.
I don't understand, Mr. Dillon, why you never reported your son missing.
his mother told me that Roger ran away.
you weren't concerned that your son never contacted you again?
he didn't live with me, he didn't want to.
because of the physical abuse?
Yeah, I was a drinker in those days.
and I understood why he wanted to just write me off.
but I cared about him. I was sick.
when was the last time you saw Roger?
it was night of his high school graduation.
he came over here, afterwards, asking me for money, a lot.
you threw him out of the house with his arm twisted behind his back.
I swear, he... he got up and he walked away.
now this was 20 years ago.
what's this all about?
Roger is dead, Mr. Dillon.
his remains were found yesterday.
Oh... God...
found him at the high school. He had been in a time capsule for 20 years.
any idea why he needed the money?
wouldn't say. Guess it was so he could run away.
you should talk to Gil. He was Roger's best friend.
Gil Bates? Yeah.
that's the Tech Town guy?
Yeah. They did everything together.
we'll be in touch.
I'm different now.
I'm sober. I never... I never wanted to hurt him. I loved Roger.
right.
the kid basically melted into all of this.
I should be able to pull more chemical traces off the artifacts to I. D.the organophosphate on him.
Beta-- St. Elmo's Fire.
it's on the list.
one yearbook. Foothill High School, 1987.
check. Dehydrate and scan.

remember those days?
I remember getting grounded every weekend.
so many rules to break, so little time...
you were the nerd fantasy.
I was all about Barbie.
she was my first anatomy lesson.
I was confused for years.
what about Ken? I felt so sorry for him.
floppy dis the size of a dinner plate.
bingo, baby. The disk is not on the list.
wow, what are you? A term paper?
launch codes?
we need to pull the data. Do you think you're up to it?
I can try.
a hockey skate.
and it looks like it's signed.
check on the skate.
it belonged to some jock named John Adamson.
a can of New Coke.
definitely an '80's plot to destabilize the country.
another check.
and a pocket watch.
the watch is not on the list.
it's a Wallingham.
it's nice. A computer disk and a pocket watch?
what was our little geek into?
it's dry.
this is a good watch.
some kind of residue.
could it help I. D. the poison?
let me at it.
Roger's father had no trouble getting physical.
so why would he resort to poisoning his son with a nerve agent?
what sort of teenager were you, Bones?
he did have a series of odd jobs.
perhaps he procured the poison from one of them.
come on, you have to have at least one good story before you pasted on a lab coat.
I was busy, studying.
and in all those hours of studying, you never came across one hormone?
fine, there was one boy.
he was the varsity lacrosse captain.
did you kiss...the varsity lacrosse captain?
I was weighing the pros and cons...
when he became my Secret Santa.
I thought you hated Secret Santa.
Yes, because he taped the gift to my locker.
everyone saw it.
teenagers can be cruel.
what was it? It doesn't matter.
come on, Bones.
you promise not to laugh?
listen, I'm your partner.
it was a Brainy Smurf.
you said you wouldn't laugh.
I'm not laughing. Brainy Smurf, huh?
well, it was deliberate. He knew I wanted Smurfette.
okay, it's clear you find this amusing.
I'm not laughing.
I'm not.
what?
you know, Angel was right--you were one of those guys.
what? One of what guys?
that was Roger in the time capsule?
I saw his skull.
Oh, my God, I saw his skull.
he's been there since 1987.
no, Roger took off. He left a note.
a note?
graduation night, he left his mom a note, saying that he hated it here and he was running away.
Yeah, and he went to his father's house to ask for money. Do you know why?
all I knew was what his mom said was in the note he left, so...
Gil, his mother was dead, and his father never saw it, so...
so, you're the only connection we have to the note.
it said, uh...
you know that he couldn't be around his dad anymore.
or the kids at school.
they picked on him.
they used to pick on me, too.
I guess, he just couldn't take it.
why wouldn't he have just asked for help?
he was my best friend.
I always thought that I'd see him again.
I can't believe I'll never see him again.
all right, I found several denim cotton fibers on both the gold watch and the floppy, matching what's left of the victim's classic acid wash '80s jeans.
that places the watch and the disk inside the victim's pocket at the time of his murder.
I tested the residue inside the watch casing.
pure crystalline tropane alkaloid.
Roger Dillon had a pocket watch full of cocaine?
it's so Miami Vice, I could roll up my sleeves.
the FBI sent us the files of everyone connected to the school who had a record.
mostly petty theft, DUI s, that sort of thing.
darwin Banks. Teacher at Foothill High.
arrested in a school wide drug bust, June 12, 1987.
that's two days after Roger disappeared.
and Roger needed money.
looks like our young geek might've been killed over a drug deal.
do you remember Roger Dillon?
Foothill High, right?
I was his science teacher.
smart kid.
he could've taught the class.
now he's dead.
we found him stuffed into Foothill's time capsule.
been there since 1987.
God...
and it says here in the yearbook that you were the faculty advisor to the time capsule committee.
you gotta be kidding.
I usually don't joke around when a 17-year-old boy's been murdered.
found evidence of cocaine on him.
Roger?
no. That kid was clean.
the only way he got high was sitting in front of his computer writing code.
right, so help me out here, because in '87 you were arrested at the high school for dealing.
I wasn't dealing. I was just out of college.
I had two joints on me.
and four ounces in your apartment.
I was 23.
we all do crazy stuff when we're kids.
exactly.
I have my own business now, a wife and two kids.
I'm in the Rotary Club for God's sake.
well, we know that Roger needed money. Maybe he started dealing for you, and he wanted a bigger payout, threatened to turn you in if he didn't get it, so you killed him?
I didn't kill him and Roger didn't rat me out.
it was Adamson, John Adamson, an entitled ass even at 17.
I caught him cheating and the next thing I know, the cops are knocking on my classroom door.
he just wanted to discredit me, so he could retake the test.
right. So you're the victim with four ounces of weed?
can you confirm your whereabouts on June 14, 1987?
if I'm such a big drug-dealing liar, why would I tell you the truth?
because you don't want to go to jail for killing Roger Dillon.
come on, sweets, come on, you've done a lot of psychological profiling.
the case is 20 years old, we just need some help.
that's not why we're here today, Agent Booth.
this hour is for you and Dr. Brennan.
Oh, she's not gonna mind; it's only gonna take five minutes, okay? 1987.
suburban kid is killed and stuffed into a time capsule.
fascinating, right?
what kind of person would do that?
so have any conflicts or issues arisen since our last session?
well...
bones and I are doing just great.
you look angry, Dr. Brennan.
I told Agent Booth a private story about my childhood and he laughed.
what?
no, I...
I was appreciating it. Don't get him involved.
snorting does not suggest appreciation.
it was about a cartoon character from the...
1980s. I didn't think you'd be so sensitive. Well, childhood icons have great significance to us, Agent Booth, all right?
I myself was very attached to Voltron.
cartoon.
you're hurt, Dr. Brennan, because you feel you opened yourself up to Agent Booth and he betrayed that trust.
we're talking about a Smurf.
Smurfette.
a childhood story about yourself.
show your vulnerability to Dr. Brennan.
no, you know what? This is crazy.
it's... it's not right. Tell him that it's not right. Is it?
Oh, you're on his side. Why don't you go play Voltron with him?
you were that guy, weren't you, Agent Booth?
you were the golden boy who could get away with anything just by turning on the charm.
that's ridiculous. You don't even know who I am.
could it be that you're still holding on to that persona, that you're afraid to reveal yourself?
I'm an FBI agent. I get shot at every day, all right?
I'm not afraid of anything. Okay, this is obviously very difficult for you.
but you shouldn't be ashamed to ask for help.
you shouldn't.
okay.
okay.
I apologize. I do need help.
with this case.
so, while you review this,
I will reveal myself to Bones.
I know that sounded weird, but you know what I mean.
so you will share an emotionally humiliating episode from your youth with me?
Yeah. I-I have them.
here.
all right. Excellent.
now, for the remainder of our time, let's role play.
now I know why I'm not allowed to bring my gun in here.
I tested the goop, found traces of cocaine consistent with the leakage from the gold watch.
but when I checked the results against samples of his hair and bones, it came out negative; Roger didn't do drugs.
so his old teacher was telling the truth?
I also discovered what he was dosed with and how much. What?
Malaoxon.
Malaoxon? -Yeah.
is neurotoxic in high doses.
Yeah, but there was barely enough to make a mouse cough.
so our theory about poisoning is incorrect as well.
Dr. Saroyan, I found an anomaly on the victim's skull.
when I was cleaning the skull,
I found a tiny irregularity on the undersurface of the victim's mandible.
magnified, it proved to be a tiny, but sharply defined fracture. Judging by its location, it appears that a weapon was cutting through the sternocleidomastoid, neck, and severing both the carotid artery and jugular vein.
which means Roger must have bled out.
have you determined a weapon?
judging by the microscopic crushing of the bone, the weapon was neither too sharp nor too blunt.
it certainly wasn't an edged weapon.
so it wasn't a knife?
correct. However, it left an odd textural stain in the crevice.
I've taken a sample and will hand it over to Hodgins for testing.
this little darling is a Commodore Amiga, with a Motorola 6800 chip set using a homemade operating system.
I got it from the computer exhibit on the third floor.
I used to have this exact computer.
my geek princess.
I knew the mall couldn't suck out your soul.
Hey, look at that.
Oh, this is incredible!
this is like a primitive Doom.
you don't see anything wrong with that?
doom came out in 1993.
all of this stuff
the 3-D rendering, the first person shooting
was barely a glint in a geek's eye in 1987!
so Roger was way ahead of his time.
if this game had come out in 1987,
Roger Dillon would have been a billionaire several times over.
money is always a good motive for murder.
I'm pretty sure that Sweets would say a lost baseball game is not personal or revealing.
football, Bones, okay. It's football.
Oh, okay, I got one. All right, personally between two people or revealing, like, uh...
Aha! Naked?
that's very literal.
there was this girl, Karen Isley, and we were under the bleachers one night.
personally. You with me?
got it. You were having sex in the dirt under the bleachers.
excuse me, I'm a gentleman.
I brought my sleeping bag.
did you fail to perform sexually?
what? 'Cause that might actually count as a humiliation.
will you just wait? Will you just allow me to tell my story?
fine. Thank you. All right, so this girl, she had this game where she would ask me a question...
what kind of a question?
it doesn't matter, okay? So, if I got the question wrong, I'd have to...
take off a piece of my clothing. Of course I knew all the answers, but I pretended that I didn't.
so you could take off your clothes?
exactly.
no, the point is, I'm standing there, you know, in my socks, and my St. Christopher medal...
she runs off.
she runs off with the sleeping bag and all of my clothes.
and I'm standing there stark.
why'd she do that?
well, I suppose she heard I was under the bleachers with another girl the week before.
okay, this is a story about sexual prowess, Booth. You're bragging.
I had to run across the campus buck naked.
you're laughing about it now.
you enjoyed displaying your penis.
it showed alpha male mastery.
only one other person knew about Brainy Smurf, was my mother.
cold, okay, it was cold.
do you know what happens to a guy when it is cold...
outside?
Hi. Hi.
can we make this quick? My boss doesn't understand why I keep leaving.
and he's kind of a jerk, so.
what do you know about, uh...
WarStrike"?
Wow.
I, I haven't heard that name in a long time.
we found it on a disk in the time capsule.
it was on Roger when he was killed.
Oh, my God.
so you knew about it?
Yeah, but only as a drawing in his notebook.
I-I didn't know he'd written the code.
Yeah, well, according to an expert at the Jeffersonian, someone could make a lot of money off of it.
we planned to. We were gonna start a gaming business after graduation.
Roger was the brain, and I was the business guy.
wait... you saw the game?
it worked?
if you were partners, why wouldn't he tell you that?
he was a perfectionist.
he would never show me anything unless he thought it was perfect.
Yeah, well, maybe he was trying to make a deal with someone else.
no. No way.
we were partners, okay. Best friends our whole lives.
Roger would never sell me out like that.
we were saving up to buy new computers to create a 3-D rendering farm.
computers were expensive back then.
where were you gonna get the money? We both worked.
I paved driveways and...
Roger worked a shift at a roller rink.
Yeah, I scraped grills at a burger shack for $3. 55 an hour.
that's humiliating.
nice try. Roger, he made extra money, um, tutoring that cheerleader, Janelle, in math.
and he got paid to take the SATs for some cokehead hockey player.
the kid got into Harvard off Roger's scores.
cokehead?
what's his name?
he's a real nasty piece of work.
great, thanks.
John Adamson was the star hockey player at Foothill.
he barely graduated from Harvard
took five years. He got in by cheating.
he didn't deserve to be there.
maybe Roger was blackmailing Adamson about the SAT scam.
so Adamson killed him?
could a hockey skate have killed the kid?
I mean, Adamson's was in the time capsule.
a metal skate blade could easily cut right through the jugular.
and the edge could create a sharply defined fracture.
well, there you go. He had a motive and a weapon.
the back table, waiting...
John Adamson? FBI Agent Seely Booth.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
have a seat, Bones.
senator expects me to concentrate on running his campaign, Agent Booth.
I hope this isn't going to be a waste of my time.
take a look at that.
do you remember Gilbert Bates or Roger Dillon from high school?
no, I'm sorry.
neither the name Gilbert Bates nor Roger Dillon means anything to me.
this boy was found inside the time capsule dead.
you might've heard about that. Like I said,
I've been busy with the senator's campaign.
Oh, because this kid said that this guy took the SAT for you.
got you into Harvard.
SATs didn't get me into Harvard, Agent Booth.
my slap shot did that.
so you don't deny that Roger Dillon took the test for you?
total cooperation.
we keep my sordid academic past in the past?
I paid Roger 200 bucks to take the test for me.
it was a done deal.
two weeks later, he comes knocking at my door, saying if I don't cough up another $500, he'll rat me out.
Roger told you why he needed the money? No.
just that a guy like me wouldn't understand.
I gave him all the cash I had.
maybe 90 bucks and my watch.
the watch with the hidden compartment for cocaine?
???
what?
uh, you're a very slow reader, Dr. Sweets.
I'm afraid Agent Booth's report on Mr. Adamson is more revealing of Agent Booth than it is of Adamson.
Really? Why?
that's for Agent Booth to share.
but I've seen John Adamson on TV enough to know that while he's harmful to the political process, he's not homicidal.
he's too sensitive.
a horny, cocaine-snorting, jock, party boy is sensitive?
Yes, definitely. And emotionally immature, totally dependent upon external validation.
cheap and greedy, too. They're always cheap and greedy.
you got all this off TV?
the point is, at the age of 17,
John Adamson gave Roger Dillon money and a watch.
if he had killed Roger, he would have taken his watch back.
very convincing. The watch part anyway.
all that insight into the intangible enigma of human behavior, and you zone in on the banal and tangible.
I bring more banal and tangible evidence.
Wow. With you people, it's really go, go, go, isn't it?
we're catching murderers.
and that is so dope, all right? I'm running up a profile right now to help.
I love being in the field.
uh, you're in a secure lab.
dude, for eight hours a day, I'm surrounded by neurotics.
okay, to me, this is field work.
uh, no offense, Dr. Brennan.
I'll finish the profile.
anyhow, we've determined that the Malaoxon in the Roger stew was originally the common organophosphate pesticide, malathion, before it broke down.
how common? There was this 1980s mosquito panic, and malathion was sprayed everywhere.
virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services says there was a quadrant bordering Foothill High School that was sprayed at 7: 45 p. m. on Thursday, June 14, 1987.
whoa.
why'd they keep such detailed records?
spraying aerial neurotoxins in an attempt to kill creatures that outlive atomic bombs tends to make bureaucrats consider possible lawsuits, I guess.
it's a housing development.
Yes, but in 1987, it was mostly a swamp.
the development was under construction.
there were only a few finished homes.
could the wind have blown the insecticide onto Roger?
in this concentration, Roger had to have been wading right through the middle of it.
why would he do that?
there's only one reason.
a girl.
what are you basing that on?
I was a boy.
and I searched the 1987 real estate records.
guess who lived in one of the only finished houses.
Janelle Brown, head cheerleader.
he was tutoring her in math.
exactly.
why would he wade through a swamp to get to the house?
there had to be roads.
it was quicker. She was a cheerleader.
she was hot. He couldn't wait.
the boy thing again.
or maybe he was peeping through her window.
could have been a peeper.
Dr. Hodgins, do boys change after high school?
only on the outside.
whoever thought hair like that looked good?
Hey, check this out.
this is weird, right?
it's a yearbook.
it's supposed to be weird and humiliating.
Yeah, but this is the "Hall of Fame" section.
it's usually, "Best Smile" and "Most Likely to Succeed.
this is "Most Likely to Get Head Stuck Up Own Ass
and "Best Rack" and "Most Likely to die of VD.
wait. Somebody put a prank version of the yearbook in the capsule to embarrass everyone 20 years later?
Yup. Look at this.
brought to you by Gruff & Grim.
so, we're looking for two kids who put a yearbook and a body into the time capsule?
okay, Bones, so there was this girl, okay?
she was the coolest, hottest girl in high school.
and I wanted to ask her to my junior prom, so what I did was,
I bribed the suck-up who did the morning announcements.
Suck-up?
Yeah, the kids who did anything to please the teachers.
so I get on the loudspeaker, and I ask her to prom.
Uh-huh.
on the loudspeaker.
this is your embarrassing story?
on the loudspeaker. Yeah.
I got laughed at for weeks.
did she go with you to the prom?
sure.
okay, this is merely another story of victory and sexual conquest.
look, Bones, they laughed at me.
okay, laughing has got to count for something.
there's no public humiliation in that story, Booth.
you don't even know what public humiliation is.
Hi. Hi.
uh, Ms. Stinson, Special Agent Booth, uh...
was your name Janelle Brown in high school?
Yes. Mind if we come in and ask you a few questions?
of course, yeah. Come in.
look at her.
I wish I was Janelle Brown again. Or at least parts of me do.
you know what I mean?
you lived at 224 Green Gates
crescent?
Yeah, just a few blocks from here.
it backed onto a swamp.
Yeah. I was scared of that swamp as a little girl.
how well did you know Roger Dillon?
Oh, I don't know. He was my math tutor.
and, well, math wasn't really my thing, so I needed a lot of help, and, well...
he kind of developed a crush on me.
he was actually kind of cute in a non-jock way, you know?
sweet.
Oh, he loved The Cure.
for what? What did he have?
it's a band, Bones.
it's... It's...It's a band.
um, did he tutor you at your place?
my place or the library. Usually my place.
I think he liked it there. You know, his own place wasn't very nice.
do you remember seeing him on, uh, June 14, 1987?
mom? Uh, I'm in here, honey.
it would have been the last day of school. Oh, uh...
I'm going to Pete's. Okay.
what's going on? Um, these people are with the FBI.
they're investigating the time capsule murder.
nothing to worry about. Your parents were just friends of the victim.
well, that sucks.
Yeah. Honey, why don't you go to Pete's?
if you're going to be late, just give me a call, 'cause you have your cell phone, right?
I have it.
okay.
what are you doing?
see you later, Mom. Okay.
you know, I-I think I actually did see Roger on the last day of school.
Why?
like I said, he was my tutor.
why would he come to your house on the last day of school?
honestly?
he brought me my graded final, but he'd have used any excuse.
I didn't encourage him, but...
high school was so long ago, and none of us is the same person.
I'm sorry Roger ended up that way, but after he dropped off my final,
I never saw him again, so...
well, uh...
thank you, Ms. Stinson. Oh, yes. Uh-huh, of course.
could you please call up Terry Stinson from the Foothill yearbook?
Mm-hmm.
track team, Vice President of the Student Council, runner up for Mr. Popularity.
where does it say that?
it's the type, sweetie.
he's Mr. Second Best.
it's kind of like when you want Brad Pitt and you get Matthew McConnaghey.
and pull up the photo of his son, Alex. Alex Stinson shows three classic examples of Mendelian inheritance.
a cheek dimple on the left side, cleft chin and detached earlobes.
distinct facial features.
wide set eyes, asymmetrical nostrils.
just like his dad.
it's nothing like his dad.
Oh, boy.
could you please replace Terry Stinson with Roger Dillon?
Oh, boy.
20 years ago, Terry Stinson finds out that Roger Dillon has sex with his girlfriend.
and he kills him.
er. We'll take a DNA test.
you realize in a murder investigation, we can't rule anything out.
did you know that it was possible that Alex was not your biological son?
what?
is it possible?
is it?
can I answer that after the DNA test?
I guess I just did.
so you didn't know?
Terry didn't know.
Alex was born on January 7, 1988.
I don't believe this.
that means you were pregnant in the spring already.
you just wanted me to believe that the baby was mine?
no, no.
I wanted... the baby inside me to be yours.
I don't get this.
Roger-- what... but he was...
why did you sleep with Roger?
he was sweet. He was...
I knew he was nuts about me.
I liked feeling special.
let's face it, Terry; back then, you were that guy.
what guy?
the guy who did anything he wanted. You didn't need me.
Roger, he came over that day. He came through the swamp. He was filthy.
his father had just beaten him up...
ms. Stinson, did you tell Roger that he had gotten you pregnant?
Yes.
he wanted to marry me.
he said he could get the money for us to go away together, but I told him I didn't want to.
I was back with you by then.
only you.
why didn't you tell me?
when I told you I was pregnant, you were so happy.
that's when I knew that you loved me. That you weren't "that guy.
we could have a great life together and we did. I'm sorry.
I had to borrow one of your pictures.
you stole that.
what did you think happened to Roger?
I don't know. He had the money. He was never happy here.
I figured that he just took off by himself.
I am so sorry.
I always wanted to tell you the truth, but I just... I just couldn't figure out how to tell you that Alex wasn't yours.
Alex is my son.
we are a family.
well, the murder happened at night on a high school playing field, not a likely place to find adults.
Plus, teenagers are dominated by their I.D.s, which make them act irrationally.
physiologically, their judgment's impaired by an incomplete frontal lobe. You're what, 22, right?
how's your front lobe?
almost there?
again, a hectoring tone.
all right, look, I'm sorry, just keep going.
all right, there was no sexual assault, no theft.
the watch and other effects were still on him.
further indications that this was just a rash and youthful act.
right, right. That's good for a kid.
this is guess work, Booth.
it's a logical interpretation of subjective analysis by a highly intelligent expert in his field, actually.
the killer knew the exact date the time capsule would be opened when he put the vi in there.
he's been waiting 20 years for that body to be found so he could reconcile himself with his past, and finally pay for his crime.
like Terry Stinson?
no.
I think you're looking for someone who's been punishing himself for years.
someone self-destructive, working far below his potential.
then why doesn't he just confess?
most likely he has in some way, Agent Booth.
the question is, were you listening?
agent Booth is an incredibly good listener.
Yeah, I really am. It's my strength.
then perhaps the time capsule was just a convenient place to stash a body.
you know, profiling's not an exact science.
but I hope I'm right. I really want to tell my girlfriend
I helped catch a murderer.
it'd be a good night for me.
the textural stain on the undersurface of Roger's mandible was liquid petroleum.
an oil product? I know. I know. Dead common, right?
but I did some further analysis.
I found that there were microscopic particles of granite embedded in the petroleum.
also, all over the broken seal to the time capsule.
definitely not John Adamson's ice skate.
Yeah, not unless he skated on asphalt.
20 years ago what I'm seeing as petroleum was asphalt.
it was driven into Roger's bone with a flat, metal...
an asphalt shovel?
Yeah.
Gil Bates worked paving driveways.
Roger was my best friend.
gruff and Grim, right?
who was who?
I was Gruff. Roger was Grim.
so you went out to the field that night to plant the yearbook in the time capsule.
right, surprise everyone 20 years down the line.
you dug up the capsule and you broke the seal with the asphalt shovel.
your amigo, Grim, wanted his money back?
the money that you earmarked for your business, all those computers that were going to make you rich.
and you couldn't do that, Gruff.
you just couldn't give Grim back the money. Could you stop using those names?
did he tell you that it was for Janelle Brown?
I bet he did. I bet old Grim said, "You know what, I'm sorry, Gruff, but there's this girl. Our plans, they're dust.
I asked you to just stop using the names.
you know, but then Grim said, "My dream has changed.
you and me, Gruff and Grim, we're finished." Stop it!
you don't know what you're talking about!
we don't know what?
did he tell you it was because she was pregnant?
he should've told you.
you would have understood.
understood what?
Janelle was pregnant with Roger's son.
Oh, my God.
he didn't say.
he just said that he loved her.
I told him...I told him how stupid that was.
I said that she'd never look at someone like him and...
he got all pissed and then he hit me.
and I just, I went and I picked up the shovel and I just...
I just jabbed.
it was an accident.
it was just a jab.
he held his neck.
and he went all white.
the wound severed both his jugular and his carotid.
he would have died quickly.
he did.
I... I held him and I told him I was sorry.
he knew that I didn't mean it.
I loved the guy.
he has a kid?
Yes.
I hope I get the chance to tell him about his father.
all right, there was this kid, uh, junior year.
okay, is this going to be another story where you think you were humiliated, but you actually were not?
just listen to me. This kid, junior year, Harlan Kinney.
he was one of those real weird, you know, looking kids. He had this big Adam's apple sticking out.
and he wore his dad's clothes to school.
you know, with the whole stretchy belt around his waist.
what's wrong with that? It's practical.
you're not listening.
he was one of those real superior types, always talking out of a thesaurus.
and one day he came up to me and a bunch of my buddies and he called us a bunch of Philistines.
you know what that means, right?
Yeah. A Philistine is a smug, ignorant person who is antagonistic toward higher thought and intelligence.
well, I didn't know what that meant till I looked it up.
I told Kinney, "Look, I'm not Philistine, I'm Catholic.
that's pretty close to humiliation.
no, that's embarrassing.
that's not the humiliating part.
Oh. My buddy, picked Kinney up and dangled him over the stairway.
you know, he begged and cried, and everyone laughed.
how is this about you?
I laughed.
I don't understand.
I could've stopped it.
I could've stepped in and helped the kid out.
instead I... I didn't.
I chose my side, and it was the wrong side.
so you were humiliated because you didn't act like a hero?
fine, fine, you know what?
I'm perfect. My life was perfect.
it's a good story, okay?
but it's a bad one.
I mean, it's both, I guess.
I mean, I get it.
yeah?
what is that?
nothing.
well, you evolved. And evolution is very impressive.
and that is definitely not nothing.
this?
did you bring that for me?
no. Good, because it's the wrong Smurf.
I liked Smurfette; that's Brainy Smurf.
Smurfette was stupid, shallow Smurf who only had her looks.
look, you're better than Smurfette.
you have your looks and a whole lot more.
you did bring that for me to charm me in case, I didn't find your humiliation story impressive, but I did so... Aha.
so I did impress you.
that's what "impressive" means, dummy.
you're such a Philistine. Ha-ha.
I'll tell you what.
you can hold on to this, and it will remind you how far I've come.
I forgive you for snorting, Booth.
evolution is a long, long process.
it takes hundreds of years.
thousands.
why do you have to always correct me?
to help you evolve.
booth, you're going to be fine.
rally. Come on.
come on, Booth.
it's gonna be fine. Come on.
come on, Booth. No...
Oh, come on...
the carbon isotopic composition of the collagen shows a value of minus 16%.
supporting the theory that the deceased was born in Provence, France.
in the 16th century.
it's time, Dr. Brennan.
the metacarpophalangeal joints are smooth, showing dexterity.
perhaps a musician.
that's enough. We're going now.
I have remains to identify.
he could have a family.
he's 500 years old.
they've probably adjusted by now.
I'm not going.
I've already made that clear.
it's Agent Booth's funeral, Dr. Brennan.
losing a loved one is...
a partner, Sweets.
I lost a partner.
someone close to you.
the funeral allows you to grieve so you can come to terms with his death.
the Artaunb original tribe in Australia grieves by burning down their village and moving to a new one.
that seems no crazier to me than gathering around a hole in the ground.
being hostile won't...
Brennan, a word.
excuse me. Professional psychologist.
look.
I know how you see things, and I respect that.
but I need to ask you a favor.
I have to go to the funeral.
I'm not going to be able to get through this alone.
I've been crying for, like, days.
I really need your shoulder here.
I need my best friend.
I knew Seeley Booth.
he was a good man who earned my respect and affection.
and I don't like many people.
booth had a selfless commitment to his work, first in the military and then the FBI.
two weeks ago, he made the ultimate sacrifice, giving his life to save his partner.
and, in that brave act, he showed us what greatness we are all capable of.
that woman was aiming at me.
I would have happily taken that bullet.
I know.
may God's mercy and love shine on Seeley Booth as he takes his place beside the Lord.
if there were a merciful God, why wouldn't He have saved Booth?
stand by.
port arms!
port!
at ease!
port!
aim...
excuse me.
Hey!
what the hell is going on?!
they appear to be fighting.
bones. Nice shot.
what?
after I got shot, the Bureau faked my death so I could finally get that guy.
I don't care.
look, I drove him underground.
he said that the only way we would ever see him again is at my funeral, so...
I don't care. Who is he?
what part of national security don't you understand, Hodgins?
national security.
catchall phrase for, "We can do anything we want.
I knew I shouldn't have gone to that funeral.
it was a complete waste of time, just like I said.
wait a second. You thought that my funeral was a waste of time?
I thought it was a lovely service, Booth.
thank you. You know, I expected to see more people though.
I always imagined a lot of ex-girlfriends crying.
Yeah. Me, too.
you are pathetic.
just know I won't be attending your next funeral.
bones, I'm telling you, you were supposed to know that I wasn't really dead. I swear!
that's why I thought you weren't crying.
informed by who, exactly?
I gave a list of people to the Bureau to inform that I was not really dead.
you know, if they didn't tell you, it's not my fault.
Dr. Brennan is actually upset because she had to face strong emotions that she'd rather deny.
striking Agent Booth indicated the depth of your feelings for him.
it was a very passionate act.
thank you. Did you hear that? Passion.
Yes. Passion.
because anger is a passion.
anger at being manipulated.
Dr. Brennan. Aw, forget it.
someone left a package for you.
it's a mandible.
look at that, huh?
two silver screws.
silver screws as in...
silver Skeleton?
as in...
Gormogon?
that's speculation.
tooth marks.
someone's been snacking on that.
snacking as in cannibalism?
evidence of cannibalism does not necessarily mean...
bones, it's Gormogon. Has to be.
Oh, God.
who has he eaten this time?
this is the fifth known victim in the Gormogon murders, all of which have been subjected to ritualized cannibalism.
he has apprentices?
Yes. One at all times, to help perform the murders, dispose of the bodies, eradicate evidence.
his mission, it seems, is to construct a complete skeleton out of the bones of his victims.
I've seen enough.
bones, I'm thinking here.
thinking about what exactly?
well, it's a pickle.
the platform is a crime scene, but we need to access it to investigate the crime.
a cake-and-eat-it-too situation.
is it a cake or a pickle?
it's Schrodinger's cat.
that I understand.
cakes and pickles meant nothing to me.
are you paralyzed by the paradox, Booth?
I'll make this easy.
what do you need first?
identity. - Let's go, people.
we need... Identity.
Whoa! Hey, easy.
all right... Whoa! Whoa!
all right, you can't... All right. There you go.
okay, the tooth sockets may contain enough tissue to check DNA.
Zack, there are markings on this bone that need to be checked out.
it appears to have been boiled.
I'll see if I can pull any mineral traces that can help us determine the water he used.
okay, I, uh, give you all permission to do whatever it is that you squints do.
I'll, uh... just...
call me.
let's go.
I need to talk to you!
what the hell, Bones?
I'm in my house, in my bathroom, in my bathtub.
how the hell did you get in here anyway?
that fake rock by your front door wouldn't fool anybody.
why are you wearing a hat that dispenses beer?
hot tub plus cold beer equals warm beer.
hat equals solion.
so why are you...?
and that cigar? Very unhealthy.
okay, what the hell do you want now, Bones? Okay?
cause I'm not really feeling too relaxed.
you should have told me that you weren't dead.
I already explained this to you.
the Bureau has to vet everyone when there is a security issue.
I was just following protocol.
protocol? Yes!
we've been pars for three years, Booth, and you've broken protocol before, sometimes putting my life in danger.
which makes sense because you clearly don't have any real concern for me.
I took a bullet for you! Once!
that only goes so far.
would you like a towel?
fine.
what is it that I should have done, Bones?
what did you want me to do?
well, you could have called me.
did you really think I needed to be vetted by your boss?
I mean, don't you trust me?
of course I do.
then why wasn't I told? It must have been something that you said.
no. I don't know why you weren't told.
but you said that I should be.
I mean, aren't you curious why I wasn't?
Yes. Do you want me to find out why you weren't told?
if it's important to you.
fine. I will.
the next time I die, I promise that I will tell you.
I'll look forward to that. Me, too.
what are you reading?
it's a novel.
it's a graphic novel.
just so you know, I find your lack of puritan modesty very refreshing.
the marks on the mandible definitely indicate that the bones have been gnawed on.
Bunot with teeth.
the markings were made by someone wearing dentures.
well, a toothless cannibal just can't cut it in today's competitive serial killer climate.
how do you know he wore dentures?
Zack found traces of polymethylmethacrylate, monomer, and tetra silicic fluromica on the mandible.
I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume that's what dentures are made of.
but not normal commercial dentures you get from the dentist.
the main ingredient is polymethyl methacrylic.
these dentures were homemade.
I got our victim's DNA results back.
is it the lobbyist?
Yep. Gormogon's last victim.
I was wondering when some part of him would show up.
what's that sucking sound?
you know what? This is my house. Okay?
you come into my house, there's no telling what you're going to hear.
Dr. Saroyan, regarding the denture medium, if we recreate the process...
it could tell us a lot about Gormogon's resources.
if you want to do one of your experiments, just say it.
we want to do one of our experiments.
go!
make plastic cannibal dentures.
you should place the jawbone in this skeleton.
Why?
because it keeps alive an interactive relationship with the killer.
that's why he provided the screws.
you know, we give him something, he reciprocates.
did you see me on TV?
no one has mentioned that I was on TV.
all right, look, how would he know if we added the jawbone to his skeleton?
well, it's his obsession.
he has some way of finding out.
which is another reason to do it.
okay, both of you are purposely not mentioning my appearance.
for all we know, Gormogon is dead, and we're not on the list of people who get to find that out.
there's a cry for attention.
wait. Bones broke into my house last night,
there was a key!
all angry, because no one told her that I was dead.
and I was just following protocol.
broke into your house?
there was a key. - And barged into my bathroom.
what were you doing?
he was drinking beer and reading a comic book.
I was taking a bath.
you read comics and drink beer naked?
wait a second. Bones burst into my bathroom, all right?
and I'm weird for being naked?
this thermoplastic has a melting point of approximately 1, 800 degrees Fahrenheit.
this would work better if we created a paste from the monomer and polymethylmethacrylate powder.
that would entail the use of complicated cosolvents to allow copolymerization without substantial phase separation.
the monomer's melting point is far below the polymethylmethacrylate.
so you didn't tell her to leave?
you just sat there naked?
it was my own bathroom, okay?
what do you wear in the tub, floaties?
ready for the monomer?
Yes, I believe so.
the mold is over there on the side table.
why don't you get the mold, and I'll mix in the monomer.
no, I'll mix it in.
please hand me the monomer, then the mold.
since when did I become the assistant?
since I became the uncontested king of the lab.
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm okay.
Oh, my God!
Oh, God...
okay, a medical team's on it's way.
Oh, my... I'll get the burn kit.
is he okay?
he's in shock, Bones.
look at his hands.
is Hodgins okay?
he's fine. Just a few minor cuts.
and don't worry about it, Zack.
they're gonna fix you up. You're gonna be as good as new.
that would be impossible, Agent Booth.
the damage is...
we'll make sure we get you the best doctors.
the cartilage is destroyed, Booth.
in addition, the trapezoid and hamate on my left hand...
Hey, hey, how about a little optimism here, huh?
I know that I can still be quite useful.
mentally, I'm still exceptional, and with prostheses...
Hey.
how are you, Zack?
quite severely injured.
are you all right?
I'm okay, man.
anything you need, Zack, just ask.
do you know how this happened?
I just added the three grams of monomer.
that doesn't make sense.
there were no dipoles like amide or carbonyl in the monomer, were there?
no, just simple phenylethene.
that's what I thought. And the PMMA was...
Hodgins, he has third-degree burns.
the doctor said you should rest, Zack.
she's right. Hey...
we're gonna figure this out, okay?
and you won't be alone, Zack.
one of us will be here all the time.
that's not necessary.
Yes, it is, because we...love you.
I'll take the first shift.
and I'll write us a schedule.
I'll get you whatever you need to keep your job.
we'll get through this.
thank you, Dr. Brennan.
a simple monomer wouldn't explode.
it just wouldn't happen.
isn't the FBI handling the analysis of the explosive residue?
excuse me if my faith in the Bureau isn't absolute.
so you don't trust Agent Madison?
I'm just getting my own results to double check.
I'm sure he's fine, but I'm independent.
you suspect that there could be a conspiracy within the Bureau?
do I hear a little 'tude, young man?
no. No, no.
but why would there be a conspiracy in this case?
totally 'tudeless question.
prominent public figures being murdered and eaten.
evidence that secret societies are being targeted.
societies that have great influence in the halls of power like the Bureau.
you don't think that's a bit extreme?
you went on Larry King to talk about this case, and TMZ, because you know how big it is.
and to get your piece of it.
I'm a doctor.
I'm merely studying the case like you.
right.
Oh, man, I should have known.
what?
you expect me to tell you the answer, Agent Madison?
it's tricyclic acetone peroxide.
that's not bad.
it reacted with the molten thermoplastic, and ... boom.
the containers must have been switched.
Zack thought he was adding a monomer he had made himself, but it was actually a volatile explosive.
Yes, I'm busy.
cancel all my patients.
you don't have to tell them anything.
what are you doing?
a word. - I'm on the phone.
well, hang up.
okay, I'll talk to you later.
uh, tight grip you got there.
it's gonna get tighter. So go ahead, tell her.
tell her what? - Tell me what?
tell her now. - What?
fine, I'll tell her, okay?
I sent my list to the Bureau, they sent it to Sweets.
you were the one who decided not to tell Dr. Brennan that I was still alive.
he's the one that you should have slugged, so do it. Go ahead and do it now.
what? You chose not to tell me?
Yes, it's true, technically.
Technically!
okay, I reviewed the list and I decided, knowing Dr. Brennan as I do, that she was, in fact, able to handle your death.
slug him.
it was a national security issue.
the fewer people that knew Agent Booth was alive, the safer you would be.
I think that was a good choice.
awesome.
you do?
Yes.
you knew that Booth's death was something
I could deal with because I can compart.
whoa, wait a minute.
now why are you mad at me then?
because you should have told me personally.
Oh, I should have just ignored national security concerns, broken the law and told you?
Yes. You know I'm very trustworthy.
Yeah, but Sweets...
sweets made a professional decision.
he knew that I could process your death and move on, - which is precisely what I did. - that's right.
there's got to be other stuff going on here, right?
what?
transference, paranoia.
come on. I mean, when I offer her a piece of pie, you say it has deeper meaning.
I don't like pie, Booth.
well, apple pie. She doesn't like baked pie.
I don't like my fruit cooked.
okay, changing the subject is a way to avoid your feelings.
my feelings? Okay, now you're attacking my feelings?
there's something in the Gormogon vault
I think you should see.
slug him.
you know, I think it's interesting psychologically how Agent Booth's constant efforts to persuade you to enjoy fruit pie could be interpreted as a kind of seduction.
whatever you two are talking about, just stop it.
zip it. Let's go.
you think I don't recognize an experiment when I see one?
you experimented on us.
beg your pardon?
not telling me Booth was alive, you wanted to quantify our reactions for your own research.
you took advantage of us.
booth and I agreed to let you observe us.
we did not agree to be used as lab rats, so you better cut it out.
Dr. Brennan, why are you talking so fast?
because if Booth hears why you did what you did, he'd beat you up.
don't you think that'd be an overly aggressive act?
not at all. So you better not do it again.
let's go, Bones. Where are you?
on our way.
security had the entrance to this wing locked and the vault itself was secured.
the skeleton...
Where'd it go?
we don't know. I came down to see if the screws matched the silver in the skeleton, and the skeleton was gone.
but there's security cameras and sensors covering every inch of this place.
they all failed.
all of 'em?
when Zack's explosion set off all the alarms, every security camera in the building failed.
the door to the loading dock was unlocked.
someone stole the skeleton.
ten minutes before the explosion?
everything is working perfectly.
fast forward,
Hodgins passes Zack the container of tricyclic acetone peroxide.
I thought it was the monomer.
the explosion occurred at 12: 03 and 22 seconds.
at 12: 03 and 22 seconds...
aren't there any backup systems?
all dead, too.
where were the guards?
there was as chemical accident.
that takes precedence over any other security issue.
all personnel went to secure the lab or to secure any point that went to the museum proper, so there'd be no loss of life.
during that time, the vault and the skeleton would be unsecured.
Yes, until the security system was brought back up at 12: 18 and 41 seconds.
the explosion was a diversion set up by Gormogon.
he's here in the lab.
it's an inside job.
Gormogon works at the Jeffersonian.
either Gormongoor his new apparentice.
that is a totally freaky thought.
Yeah, it's Booth. listen, I need a full forensic team sent to the Jeffersonian
mobile labs, computers, analysis, the works.
no, their equipment could be compromised.
hair, prints, anything?
not since you asked five minutes ago, no.
Dr. Saroyan, please don't bother the techs.
you have a problem, you see me.
it's my people you suspect here.
I want to make sure you're doing your job.
after all, you're a prosecutor, not a forensic.
you have been breathing down our necks for two hours, Cherie.
why don't you go get latte or some
you shouldn't be here anyway.
this is my department.
I know, and you have full security clearance and complete access to the lab and the vault.
are you saying I'm a suspect now?
I'm saying someone's gonna put your name on the list.
you were a cop. Weren't you?
you've got over 30 agents here.
find something.
the Medico-Legal lab has over 100 employees.
Yeah, and all their records are being looked at, including yours and mine.
well, you're just having coffee? Don't you want pie?
I'm fine.
you always have pie.
can we stop talking about pie?
because of what Sweets said?
I'm just going pie-less, okay?
can we talk for a minute?
I have a profile of someone I feel could be Gormogon.
no pie? You always eat pie.
enough with the pie. Will you just sit down?
all right.
whoa. You've been spying on us?
more experiments?
what experiments?
I'm just being thorough.
the dynamics of our work environment play a role in how I treat you and Agent Booth.
sweets, can we just get on with it? Who is it?
I believe it's Dr. Hodgins.
what is Dr. Hodgins?
Gormogon. He thinks Hodgins is Gormogon.
Hodgins exhibits clinical paranoia as well as a rationalized feeling of superiority.
paranoia.
Yeah. He's consumed by numerous conspiracy theories.
my observations today, he's even suspect of the FBI, with whom he works closely.
it's all supposition. There's no concrete evidence.
no, no, no. Go on.
booth! - What?
Hodgins knew all about the secret societies.
I mean, he figured out the patterns Gormogon used that led us to the vault.
Yes, he was doing his job.
or justifying himself.
he had access to all the chemicals Zack was using.
he could have changed the labels.
he and Zack are friends.
I also had access to the chemicals Zack made.
why am I not a suspect?
well, you have a reverence for life that belies the cold calculations of a killer, and the emotional connection you share with Agent Booth.
no, I don't have time for this. No.
don't you know by now you can't rush her?
we're trying to catch a killer.
I thought it best not to waste time.
look, he's just trying to help, Bones.
well, his opinions won't get you a conviction.
he doesn't have any evidence.
Yeah, but he's a profiler with a great track record.
who?
sweets.
sweets says that Hodgins is the killer.
well, that makes sense.
what? Well, it throws suspicion off him.
who? Sweets.
you think that Sweets is the killer?
well, he shows up right after you find the Gormogon vault, when Gormogon's at his most vulnerable, and in therapy he plays you two like a cheap piano until you ask for the case.
wait a second. Nobody plays me like a cheap piano.
Hey, we all trusted the "brilliant, young profiler.
I got him security clearance because he was going to help us.
he was here.
he had the opportunity to switch Zack's chemicals.
except he's not a chemist.
he's the only one we can't account for after the explosion.
great, now we sound like Sweets. We have no evidence.
I was a cop for ten years, Dr. Brennan.
I can smell it on him.
I'm sorry, but we need more than your gut feeling.
well, then find it.
cause trust me, Sweets is your boy.
Dr. Hodgins, knocking would be appreciated.
right.
sorry.
so, rumor is, one of us is a suspect.
who is it?
I can't say. You know that.
of course not.
and since it's a rumor, it might not even be true, right?
do you have a legitimate reason to see me, or...
are you just here to squeeze me for information?
I've found something.
Zack said he thought the mandible had been boiled.
to remove tissue.
I pulled trace elements from the mandible and ran them through the mass spectrometer to see what the bone was boiled in.
it was tap water.
but see this spike here?
lead? - Yes.
I thought the city had to replace all their lead pipes.
they did, but individual homeowners didn't.
I focused on neighborhoods with the highest lead levels.
older homes are the worst offenders.
this neighborhood matches the level of lead found on the victim's bone.
isn't that your house?
Yes, it is.
but there are other people that live in the area, too. - Yeah, of course.
I'll pull this along to the investigators.
good.
is there anything else?
I could have fudged the facts.
I could've left my neighborhood out.
Yes, but that would have raised suspicion if someone had double-checked your results.
if you need me, I'll be at my station...
helping.
Hey.
this is a surprise.
Yeah.
Hey, Sweets, uh, where were you after the explosion?
I was with you.
no, you were with us when the explosion occurred.
I mean after.
uh, let's see, I ran to call 9-1-1.
where?
in your office. Why?
then what?
then I went to the door to show the EMTs where to go.
you didn't come in with them.
no, I find it's best to stay out of the way of the professionals in those situations.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot one thing.
what's that?
I went down to the vault and stole the Silver Skeleton because I'm...
I'm Gormogon's apprentice.
that's a confession.
you know, I can lock him up for 72 hours.
you'd lock me up for sarcasm?
I think you should.
wait, you guys actually think that I'm Gormogon's apprentice?
well, somebody is. That way, I can lock you up, check out your storyand not running off to Bolivia.
this is fierce wretched.
better safe than sorry. - Yeah.
no, you're projecting, Agent Booth.
you have a reasonable hostility toward Gormogon.
but you have no outlet for those feelings, so you're using me...
am I gonna have to break out my cuffs?
you know what? Yeah. You are gonna need your cuffs.
cause I'm not about to make this easy for you.
hi...
how's Zack?
well, he's in a lot of pain, but he won't let me push the painkiller button.
he's scared of polka dots, but screaming agony is just an interesting phenomenon.
drugs give me bad dreams.
Oh, hey there, Zack.
I'm walking somewhere, and suddenly someone takes me by the hand.
and I look and it's a skeleton.
and the skeleton's on fire, and my hands hurt.
take the painkillers, sweetie.
I've been thinking about the explosion, Hodgins.
no one could have switched the chemicals.
I locked up the container when I left the room.
I had the only...
key...
you...
would know, but... you...
I'm afraid the painkillers, while pleasant, dull my intellect.
sometimes your friends gotta step in...
dumb it up for you.
don't you think it's time to go home?
sorry, Cam, I...
seem to be a bit anxious.
don't worry about it. It's going around.
Hodgins came to talk to me, and I almost jumped out of my skin.
what's keeping you so late?
looking at the tissue we What's used for the DNA tests...
the victims' DNA alleles in the roots were destroyed.
and the marrow alleles were altered.
then I remembered when I first looked at the jawbone, it seemed lighter in color than I expected.
it was treated with ultraviolet light?
I think so.
who would do that?
we would.
standard procedure for skeletal remains when we put them away for storage.
we have over 10, 000 sets of remains waiting to be identified.
what better place to hide a skeleton?
how do we sift through 10, 000 sets of remains?
I'd like to welcome all of Dr. Brennan's grad students to Limbo.
it's Modular Skeletal Storage.
I don't like the moniker "Limbo.
over 10, 000 lost souls remain here, sweetie, unidentified, waiting.
it's a good name. Let's just go with it.
each of these boxes contains the skeletal remains of one person.
in this case, a skull, two femurs, five vertebrae, miscelneous phalanges and three molars.
what we want you to do is conduct an inventory, making sure that what's in the box corresponds not only to the card in the box but also to the computer record.
does this count toward our final grade?
listen, Brennan's grad students, what we're trying to do here is catch a serial killer, not get a gold star from "teach.
we think that he's hidden the remains of one or more of his victims here.
bones tucked into boxes where they don't belong.
and I think it's fair to say that if you help us catch a serial killer, that you'll pass your precious course.
that's not necessarily true.
if anyone else shows up down here indicating an interest in what you're doing, either tell Ms. Montenegro or shout for Security.
Why?
because serial killers get mean when you get close to catching them.
this is just creepy.
well, it's the natural order of things.
we all end up this way.
thank you, Cherie, now you've made it creepy and depressing.
I found an extra femur in one of the boxes - and an extra fibula in another. - You sure?
the remains in the box were of a four-year-old child.
the femur was from a man in hisid-40s to early 50s.
and the fibula? - Also from a middle-aged man.
it had recently been boiled.
three other people found extra bones, as well.
I found an extra manubrium, a male ulna and a humerus in a box of female remains.
okay, lay out all of the extra bones anatomically.
it's already done. Over here.
nice job.
I'm third in my class.
I'd like the names of the two students in front of you.
45 to 50 years old.
fibula and femur show a height of approximately 180 centimeters.
how tall is that in English?
approximately 5'8."
have Dr. Saroyan take DNA samples and compare them to all of Gormogon's known victims.
you suspect something, don't you?
I have no facts yet. My opinions are not relevant.
let me make the call, Cherie.
give me some of that big brain of yours.
someone removed the mandible from the skull.
it's the one that was sent to you.
I can't say that with certainty.
Dr. Saroyan should see if the DNA matches.
didn't you hear her?
get this up to Dr. Saroyan.
now.
Dr. Brennan,
I think you should take a look at this.
all of the canines have been removed from these skulls.
just the canines.
I want the security tapes from this room for the last six months.
the room isn't covered.
why not? It's Limbo.
I- I need to reexamine the mandible
Zack was working on before the explosion.
of course you do.
it's the lobbyist that disappeared.
DNA's a match and so are the dentals.
Dr. Brennan's gonna want to take a look at the markings on these.
what's that? More cannibal teeth marks on the bone?
Gormogon went after this like Henry VllI after a chicken leg.
these appear to have been gnawed on, too.
they'll probably match the denture marking Zack found.
they won't.
you haven't looked at them yet.
Zack said these markings on the mandible were made by artificial dentures made from polymethyl methacrylate and other polymers.
and...?
they were not made by artificial dentures.
Zack should've known that.
he made a mistake. It happens.
not often.
hey...
I heard Zack was wrong about the dentures - No. - What do you mean? Cam and Caroline said...
he knew they weren't artificial.
any first-year student would know that.
the dentures were made from real teeth.
all canines.
Oh, whoa.
canines are a symbol of the wolf which appears on the Gormogon tapestry in the vault.
certain ancient sects revered the wolf as a symbol of freedom
as a representative of the forces that will deliver us from persecution.
okay, Bones, enough about the wolf.
what's going on?
Zack lied.
Why?
he... he took the teeth from bone storage and he made Gormogon's dentures.
Zack has complete access to the lab.
he arranged for the explosion himself.
it's Zack.
he's the killer, Booth.
it's Zack.
the theory of conditional expressions "is a non-profound generalization of propositional calculus.
what's it say after Boolean forms?
well, there's a little thing that looks like a Japanese stool, then a tail, then a fat fish.
this makes sense to you?
it doesn't to you?
we need the room.
I'm sorry, but I have to ask- are you absolutely certain?
because...
I did not see that coming.
you looked at the mandible.
you had to know I'd see it eventually.
I didn't foresee the extent of my injuries.
I was going to sneak out of here, but...
your friends never left your side.
and you intended to steal the jawbone and add it to the silver skeleton.
but you designed explosion.
you must have known exactly how big it would be.
Hodgins argued with me.
he stood too close.
the delay allowed the thermoplastic to reach the boiling point.
and as a result, the explosion was three times more powerful than I calculated.
you must have known how badly you'd be injured.
Yes.
who's Gormogon, Zack?
that's not what he's called.
then what is he called?
the Master.
and you're his apprentice? - I need a name.
I can't tell you.
the apprentice is expendable.
I'm expendable.
who is he?
Zack responds to logic, Booth.
Really? 'Cause I'd love to hear the logic of killing and eating people to change the world.
the Master's logic is irrefutable.
Irrefutable?
I saw him choking a child at the bottom of a pool.
if you knew what I know, you'd understand.
you'd be proud of me.
I've always been proud of you, Zack.
I've never met anyone more rational or intelligent.
but there's a fault in your logic.
with all due respect, you aren't cognizant of his logic.
assumption number one: secret societies exist.
accepted.
Hodgins has been explaining this to me for years.
assumption number two:
the human experience is adversely affected by secret societies.
accepted.
assumption number three:
attacking and killing members of secret societies will have an ameliorating effect on the human experience.
accepted.
all of your assumptions are built upon a first principle, Zack.
to wit: the historical human experience as a whole is more important than a single person's life.
Yes.
yet you risked it all so you wouldn't hurt Hodgins.
there's...
you are correct, there's an inconsistency in my reasoning.
bones, I need a name.
we know.
he first approached me three months ago at a symposium on burning plasma diagnostics.
I need to know who this guy is.
I need to go get him. Now.
I don't know his name.
I've never known his name.
but I've been to his house.
I was blindfolded when he fit me there, but I remember every turn he took and I was able to estimate his speed, so when he brought me home,
I found it on a map.
it's in Benning Ridge, on a street called Savoy Crescent.
it's a big place.
almost as big as Hodgins' house, but run down.
there's a flight of stairs at the back, outside.
there's a blue door.
it will be locked but there's a key hidden in a crevice to the left of the door just above eye-level.
you will see a hallway.
if he's found someone you will smell meat cooking and that's how you'll know you're getting close.
one last door and you'll have to be fast.
he'll be at the bottom of an incline in the floor.
he'll have a knife.
he's very fast and he's very strong.
did you get him?
got him.
who was he, Booth?
nobody.
am I right?
he was nobody.
an invisible man angry at history for not seeing him.
for a nobody, he sure wrecked a lot of lives.
Zack confessed to killing the lobbyist.
stabbed him in the heart.
he never ate anybody?
no. So how did this happen?
logic.
no. I'm sorry, Cherie, that might cut it with you eggheads, but this happened the way this always happens.
a strong personality finds a weak personality and takes advantage.
I hope we fry the guy.
that's not going to be necessary.
good riddance, I say.
what'll happen to Zack?
I cut a deal.
he pleads guilty, cooperates, and we find him non compos mentis.
that way, Zack is moved to a secure psychiatric facility instead of going to prison.
no, it won't stand up.
Zack isn't actually insane.
sweets, you're going to give this one to Bones, you understand?
I understand. Good.
I probably could have spent more time with Zack.
you know, get him to see the world a bit more.
all those things I say about secret societies, and conspiracies...
I never knew he was listening.
I should have gotten him a girlfriend.
you know what? The hell with Zack.
he's an adult. He made his choices.
people are who they are.
there's nothing any of us have done for the guy.
we love Zack, Cam.
well, he killed someone.
and he deserves to be locked up for the rest of his life.
I feel I must point out that what Dr. Saroyan just said is obviously her way of handling grief.
she doesn't mean it.
quite the opposite, in fact.
I knew the day I met Zack, he'd cause me pain.
so what do you got there, Hodgins?
this is, uh... Zack's favorite stuff.
what are we going to do with it?
where he's going, they may actually let him have it.
Oh... I got him that.
Yeah, thanks.
he waved that in my face every day.
the pocket Kama Sutra.
I gave him this, so he'd stop asking Booth sex questions.
I got Zack this before he went to Iraq.
hey...
I drew this for him.
it's interesting that all of his favorite things are objects you people gave to him.
I never gave him anything.
Brennan, he totally loved you.
I mean, as much as he was capable.
but I never gave him anything.
dear Mr. Addy...
it is my pleasure to offer you the post of my intern "in forensic anthropology.
I chose you from hundreds of applicants "because of your knowledge, "your desire to learn, and because I feel you will find a home here.
I think you gave him something great, Bones.
Oh, I'm so toasted.
Yeah, me, too.
what?
early morning.
shouldn't it be foggy?
global warming.
but it's all good.
no, not really.
I don't want to be negative, but it's not all good.
just ask a penguin, man.
global warming sucks.
what's that?
global warming is when some kind of carbon gasses get built up...
no, what's that?
just trash.
no, man.
look at that-- thank God, somebody got murdered.
okay, let's go.
you're supposed to turn your phones completely off during our sessions, you know?
not just vibrate.
it's a matter of respect.
Hi, guys. - You can release 24...
Dr. Brennan.
Mr. Nigel-Murray, what are you doing here?
we decided to utilize some of your brighter grad students until we find a full-time forensic anthropologist, remember?
do you consider yourself one of my brighter grad students, Mr. Nigel-Murray?
Yes. And so do you, Dr. Brennan.
I am not calling this kid Mr. Nigel... anything.
Vincent. Or Vince. Or Vinnie, Vin, Vincenzo.
actually, uh, I had this girlfriend once who used to call me Vino Delectable because of how my, eh...
you don't... need to know that.
uh, what do you need me to do first?
I need you to go back to the lab.
I thought perhaps you might want Vin...cent to shadow you, get a real sense of what you do.
little known forensic fact: tongue prints are as distinctive as fingerprints, so...
I can be useful in the field.
I need a forensic anthropologist in the lab so I can spend my time aiming Agent Booth in the right direction.
aiming Agent Booth"? What, like a hose?
well, here. Take my car.
I'll get a ride with Booth.
how were these remains found?
well, let me aim you in this direction, okay, Bones?
two-- let's call them hippies-- found these remains this morning.
deadheads.
Oh, I sold veggie burritos and followed Phish one whole summer.
it was fantastic.
I'm not able to ascertain sex without a pelvic bone.
well, if this scrap of cloth is a bathing suit, then probably female.
are you good at estimating time of death for submerged corpses?
heavily degraded by crab and fish.
two to three weeks?
that could be a breast implant.
Breasts-- that's my department, okay?
you give me a serial number, my guys will be able to track that down.
why is there only half a skeleton?
because the spine has been severed.
so, severed spine equals foul play.
no, not necessarily.
then it was an accident.
no, it was foul play.
I just said that.
mm, this hand has sustained trauma.
shark attack.
no. The fingers got smashed from what looks like multiple blows.
that suggests foul play and...
not by a shark.
we'll have Hodgins take a close look for particulates.
okay, great. So what do we do next?
find the other half.
what do you see, Mr. Nigel-Murray?
eye sockets.
anything special about these sockets?
there are no eyeballs in them?
we already have Agent Booth to make lame jokes. Let's stick to facts.
the rods in the human eye are sensitive enough to detect the light emitted by a struck match from as much as a mile away on a clear night.
okay, let's stick to relevant facts.
the sockets have been ground down.
okay, that could be useful.
especially if you have an explanation.
plastic surgery.
she had, uh, fake boobs, too.
obs"-- I wouldn't use these words when conferring with Dr. Brennan.
I know. With her, it's all "supraorbital limbus" and "mammary implants.
but you seemed a more colloquial sort.
well, in that case, what about the backbone?
a clean transection between the L1 and L2 vertebrae.
obviously, that would have been fatal if it had happened while the victim were still alive.
this conk to the parietal bone would not have been fatal.
and these abrasions are puzzling.
postmortem scraping from the remains being washed up on a stony beach.
should I have known that?
point is, you do now.
the remains show traces of freshwater and pelagic sediment common to Chesapeake Bay.
grad student?
he's done very well so far.
he'll disappoint. - Why?
I've discovered microscopic tooth shards from the Alosa sapidissima, also known as the American shad, on what flesh there is.
in the 1700s, the shad was especially valued as a delicacy.
Yeah. Fascinating.
based on currents, shad populations and sheer guess work...
don't tell him you're guessing.
the victim died in the same body of water in which she was found, probably within six miles.
I got a serial number off the breast implant.
the FBI's tracking it down now.
traces of copolymer on the vertebrae, nearly microscopic.
I'm chasing that down.
I... won't disappoint.
I graduated with first-class honors from Leeds.
also, I have a retentive memory.
that would explain the, um...
informative tangents.
does Brennan put "Mister" in front of your name?
Yes.
it's her very subtle way of saying you're not a doctor.
don't tell him that.
do you know what large-breasted women and fish remind me of?
be very careful what you say next, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
topless saleswomen are legal in Liverpool, England, but...
only in tropical fish stores.
tangents, Mr. Nigel-Murray, tangents and diversions.
perhaps we could keep those to a minimum.
the FBI's traced the breast implant to a Baltimore plastic surgeon.
he replaced a leaking implant for this woman.
so, her name is Patricia Ludmuller, RR #1, Maylor Island, Maryland.
Yeah, reported missing three weeks ago.
presumed drowned after she didn't come back from her morning swim.
very striking facial features.
Yeah, well, according to your Mr. what's his name?
Yeah. Those were mostly artificial, too.
how many people live on Maylor Island?
I'd say about a couple thousand
that's one of those end-of-the-world places where the weirdoes flock.
why go to this much trouble to make yourself look beautiful and then move to the end of the world?
well, the background check on her turned up suspiciously little.
all right? There's no credit cards, no driver's license.
officially, she didn't exist before five years ago.
witness protection?
no. Marshals say she's not one of theirs.
but, you know, sometimes they lie.
if you really wanted to hide, you wouldn't make yourself look beautiful.
well, if you want to hide, Bones, you'd change your looks as much as you can.
talk about low profile.
it's very peaceful.
Yeah, well, these peaceful places, they usually have a seething underbelly.
Really? - Well, I mean, what do I know?
I'm from Philly, where the underbelly's on top.
just focus. Look-- our victim's home.
this is a very spiritual person, catholic in her tastes.
Oh, what, you can tell she's Catholic?
not Catholic, catholic.
encompassing, universal.
she has a lot of religious books, but they cover a wide range of dogmas and philosophies.
she herself seems to be Protestant.
there's crosses, no crucifixes.
she's a pastor. Yeah.
looks like one of those grassroots community churches.
she was preparing for a sermon.
a pastor with breast augmentation and veneers?
so?
a spiritual leader shouldn't be so vain.
the Pope sits on a throne; he wears robes worth thousands of dollars.
isn't that vanity?
Really?
you're going after the Pope now?
one pastor gets her teeth whitened, and the other drinks wine on Sunday mornings and tells everyone that it's been miraculously transformed into blood.
which of those is more outlandish?
you have one new message.
it's JP again.
I'm sorry. I-I miss you.
I need to see you-- it's important.
I really need you, Patty. Please call. Please.
sounds like a lost sheep in need of religious counseling.
sounds more like a desperate boyfriend.
nothing here. It's just caller ID's blocked. Hold on.
yeah? Where? Bones.
they found a pelvis and legs in the water about eight miles from here in the Virginia side of the bay.
they should take it to the lab. - Okay, send it over to the lab, now.
there's more tissue on this half.
and just because we have the top of a body and the bottom of a body doesn't mean it's all the same body.
this half starts where the other half ends, at the L2 vertebra.
coincidence? I think not.
based on the lack of hemorrhagic tissue, this victim was already dead when cut in half.
he's in the water...
drowning, maybe, or-or he was pushed from a boat.
when he reaches for the boat, his fingers are smashed.
he drowns, and then is cut in half later in some maritime mishap.
he?
triangular pubis.
no evidence of a ventral arc.
the pelvic bone speaks-- it says, "I be male.
the pelvic bone can say whatever it wants to say-- this part here says female.
what part's that?
it's called a vagina.
did you know that women blink twice as often as men?
which might be useful information if the fish hadn't eaten our victim's eyelids.
Ah, relevance.
well, I can do a DNA comparison to find out if these two sets of human remains come from the same victim.
the measurements of the vertebrae match perfectly.
I-I'm nearly positive that it's all one victim.
who is...
male. - And female.
a transgender?
post-op. She had female sex organs.
so if she had sexual reassignment surgery, she would be a transsexual.
how do they do that?
they split the penis, and then turn it inside out-- carefully, so as not to damage the nerves.
and then they use the glans to create a nerve cluster dense enough to achieve orgasm.
okay, new rule. No surgical details, all right?
generally, transgendered people feel that they're the victim of a cosmic mistake.
they're certain, from a young age, that they were born into the wrong body.
surgery and hormone treatments are a way to correct that biological mistake.
which is why Patricia Ludmuller's past only went back five years.
are pastors allowed to think that God makes those kind of mistakes?
do you think God makes that kind of mistake?
I think that God expects us to overcome certain things.
the term "trans" conveys a meaning of "beyond the cross.
moving further. There's a very spiritual component.
let's say some hyper religious fundamentalist finds out that Sister Patricia used to be Father Paul...
and murders her.
okay, you mentioned that there was an intense message on Patricia Ludmuller's answering machine, right?
Yes.
if, say, she had sex with a man, and then informed him that she was transgender, isn't that a more likely motive for murder?
anthropologically speaking, a male's status in a society is closely connected with what he perceives to be his outward maleness.
look, there's no way the guy on that answering machine knew that he...
she... he... knew that she... he...
was transgender.
how do you know?
well, because I know an "ain't too proud to beg" phone call when I hear one, all right?
he had no idea that she wasn't a real woman.
that's very insightful. - Thank you.
insightful. See?
except for the "real woman" slip.
have you made many of these "ain't too proud to beg" calls in the past?
what do you say we just stay focused here?
okay, have you ruled out completely that Patricia Ludmuller's murder might be because of something that happened before he became a woman?
I put a request in to find out his previous identity before he was a woman.
that's the best I could do.
okay, from now on, he is always a she.
she was a he when she died, so she deserves the respect due to him or her...
okay, person!
okay... I'm a genius, and I'm confused.
pastor Patricia was our center.
like the best leaders, she drew us together without even trying.
did you release identity?
their pastor went for a swim and never came back. All right?
the body washed up.
intuitive leap. Right.
let's pray together.
let's pray that whatever happened to Patricia out there alone came peacefully.
that God embraced her as His daughter.
that there was no pain, only God's great serenity.
a moment of silence for the pastor we loved so much.
what are you doing?
I'm praying. Would you keep your voice down?
sorry. You're not a member.
it's not a gym, Bones.
excuse me, Mr. uh...
Wade Schmidt. You're FBI?
how did you know that Patricia Ludmuller was the victim found in the bay?
she's a member of our community, and she's gone-- we feel her loss.
we're right, aren't we?
Yes.
is there a... a vice pastor? Somebody else we can talk to?
not really. I take care of the finances.
Chuck, over there, he acted as kind of an unofficial assistant to Patricia.
what will happen to the church now?
to be honest, I'm not optimistic that we'll survive Patricia's loss.
Why? You're a community of people with a common superstition.
the shared illusion should be enough to bind you.
Patricia would like you.
she'd say, "That's the one that will keep us honest.
see? She would have liked me.
she keeps everyone honest-- this one.
Hey, Chuck, you got a moment?
these people are from the FBI.
I thought Patricia drowned.
we don't know the cause of death yet.
she went for a swim on a foggy morning.
she got cut in half by a yacht propeller or a destroyer returning to Norfolk, okay?
we don't know how the body was disarticulated.
what the hell do you know?
we know what we don't know, Mr. Kennedy.
that's why we're asking questions.
Yeah, we do have a few felons in our congregation-- former addicts.
not to mention the less serious sins-- lying, vanity, sloth, greed.
I, myself, had a meth problem.
would you like to arrest me?
is that a confession, Chuck?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm confessing to a past.
I have a past, like everybody else.
I bet even you do.
of course, God absolved me of my past.
how about you?
see you around. - He's taking it hard.
the way Chuck sees it, Patricia introduced him to God, and God saved his life.
gave him focus, made him part of a community.
do you have a congregant called JP?
Yes.
could you point him out to us, please?
it's still hard to believe the pastor's gone.
I understand she was one hell of a swimmer.
Hey, Booth, I'm looking at these pictures you gave me, and body language and facial expressions tell some very interesting stories.
why don't you give me your insights?
she swam every single day. Yeah.
but you don't need me for that insight.
ask anybody.
he holds himself separate from the congregation.
what do you think that means?
how long have you been a member of the Inclusion Church?
well, I joined about six months ago.
he's a latecomer to the church, huh?
that's a good one. - Thank you.
for sharing that.
why would anybody lie about when they joined a church?
so what brought you to the church?
I had a drinking problem, which gave me problems with the law, which gave me marital problems.
you served two years less a day for assault.
when I got out of jail, I wanted my wife back.
I wanted my life back.
it doesn't look like things are going so great with the wife.
are you living with your wife again?
I got a ways to go before Rita trusts me whole hog, you know?
Plus, she's not that excited about the religious aspect.
why is the FBI interested in a pastor drowning?
well, there's more than one way for a person to drown.
did you always call her "pastor"?
what else would I call her?
Hey, it's JP again.
I'm sorry. I... I miss you. I need to see you.
it's important.
I really need you, Patty. Please call. Please.
you got it all wrong.
that call is not what you're thinking.
I was calling the pastor about Rita. - Really?
hold on a minute.
look at the last photo. He knew.
you can't tell that from a photo.
I beg your pardon? - I can.
he knew that she used to be a man.
it doesn't show in the photographs.
you know what I'm saying?
about what Patricia was before?
I told you he knew.
what was your reaction when you found out that Pastor Patricia wasn't a real woman?
don't say Patty wasn't a real woman. It makes you sound ignorant.
the pastor came between you and your wife, but she was living a lie.
you lost your manhood and your religion all in one go.
or what? Did prison just widen your tastes?
you're just pretending to be a jerk to get a rise out of this guy, right?
I didn't want to develop feelings for Patricia, but I did, and that didn't change when she told me who she used to be.
who did she used to be?
what do you want, a name? I don't know. I never asked.
can't you look it up on some legal name change form?
if you'd have ever met Patty, you'd know what I know.
what God knows. What she knew.
Yeah. I'm with him on
bone marrow and liver remnants contain high concentratis erone acetate and spironolactone, which is an anti-androgen.
hormone replacement therapy.
very healthy bone mass.
high percentages of calcium and vitamin D.
which indicates...
a health nut.
tox screen shows Stamaril, Havrix Monodose and Engerix-B.
vaccinations?
yellow fever, Hep A and Hep B.
all necessary for traveling to the Far East.
did you know that only 20% of Americans have passports?
that's not irrelevant.
perhaps that's why there's no record of this guy... woman...
having a sex change. It could have happened in, you know, Thailand.
very good, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
though conjecture is not really what we do here in the lab. So...
but very good, Mr. Nigel-Murray.
can I ask you something?
is there any way to say no?
whatever happened to whoever it was who used to work here before me?
he joined forces with a serial killer who was the last in a long line of cannibalistic murderers specializing in knocking off members of secret societies and building skeletons out of their body parts.
I hope that doesn't happen to me.
so he's not coming back?
no. He's locked up for the rest of his life.
but we all still like him.
excuse me.
Hello, hello, hello.
are you familiar with the expression, "That's way too much car for you"?
I believe that's one of ours, actually, sir. Yes.
I want to show you something.
I want to show you something.
vroom, vroom, kid.
you're already in my rearview mirror.
booth said the FBI couldn't find any record of an official name change, or anything showing who Patricia Ludmuller was before the sex change operation.
it's possible she had her surgery done in the Far East.
in England, the Speaker of the House is not allowed to speak.
anyway, what I did was...
here she is as a woman.
hmm, not bad.
I mean, I mean the sketch... Okay.
here I made her more masculine.
I made the bony prominences more robust, increased the size of the mastoid processes and the nuchal crests.
seldom seen bigger nuchal crests.
it doesn't look like anybody you recognize?
should it?
I also added facial hair.
do you recognize him now?
it's that guy.
Oh, evil spirits, come out.
that's exactly what I thought.
Yes, God makes demands of us!
this money belongs to God, not me!
who will join me in giving God what is rightfully His?
he is asking you now, at this moment.
what is your answer?
what is your answer to God when He calls your name?
will you deny Him?
pastor Patrick Stephenson.
disappeared six years ago.
Oh, wow, I got it right.
he disappeared from, uh, Vietnam or Thailand, one of those places.
Yeah, on a world tour.
his followers said he was the first of many who'd be taken up in the Rapture.
so that guy went from that to being a woman pastor in a cottage on Chesapeake Bay?
some people would call that heaven.
amazing job, Angela.
Yeah, well, check this out.
she had a wife and son before she gave up being a he.
the Thai federal police were certain that Patrick had been robbed and killed.
Yeah, well, uh, it's a lot to absorb.
a sex-change operation in Bangkok, Thailand costs about $25, 000.
you want me to believe that Patrick stole money and then had himself transformed into a woman?
it's a scenario.
Patrick was a religious man.
he would never offend God in this blatant manner.
the theft, you mean, because it's a sin?
a sex-change operation.
we are made in God's image, Dr. Brennan.
who are we to alter that image?
obviously, you dye your hair, there's evidence of plastic surgery.
that's different.
bones. - How?
it's augmenting God's work, not undoing it completely.
how about that, Bones?
we have a DNA match between your husband and the deceased female found in the Chesapeake Bay.
do these people believe in DNA?
look, it seems as though your husband sent a check made out to the church every month.
a hundred dollars a month?
so Patrick was repaying us for the money he took?
actually, it's more accurate to say that
Patricia was repaying you for the money that Patrick took.
during these intervening years, did your husband ever try to contact you?
no.
I believed the Thai police when they declared Patrick dead.
and your son?
Ryan would definitely have told me if he'd heard from his father.
Oh, we're gonna have to talk to him.
the last I heard, he was in California.
after his father vanished, Ryan took over preaching the Word of God to our flock...
for about a year.
then he had a crisis of faith and left.
Ryan is still in the throes of that crisis.
I have faith that in the fullness of time, God will lead Ryan back to us.
before your husband... - Became a woman?
disappeared, did he have any reason to fear for his life?
a man named Arthur Ford was arrested for assaulting Patrick.
why did he assault your husband?
he had a son.
the boy donated his entire trust fund to the church.
his father thought that we'd brainwashed him or some such nonsense.
did you give the money back?
the boy wasn't brainwashed, Dr. Brennan.
the Lord touched him.
exactly how much money did the Lord touch him for?
$5 million?
great, thank you.
$5 million is a ton of moolah, but Arthur Ford is not a good suspect.
Why? What with the ton of moolah they practically stole from his son?
that phone call I just had, Arthur Ford died of pancreatic cancer three years ago.
Oh. - Yeah, "Oh.
do you think she loved her husband? - Who?
Mrs. Stephenson.
Oh, I don't know. She was plenty angry at him.
for getting a sex-change operation?
no, no, no, before that.
I mean, she only called him by his given name or referred to him as Ryan's father.
never, you know, "my husband.
I call you "Booth," and I like you just fine.
thank you, but we're not married.
one angry father might be dead, but, uh, maybe there are more.
Patrick Stephenson wasn't murdered, Patricia Ludmuller was.
you think the moment Patricia Ludmuller came to exist, Patrick Stephenson stopped?
when the butterfly emerges, does the caterpillar cease to exist?
okay, what are you, like some kind of kung fu master?
why don't we just figure out who killed this guy...
gal, person, okay?
would you like me just as much if I were a man?
Oh, yeah, much better. I wouldn't have to be so polite and accommodating.
how about you? Would you like me better if I was a woman?
no, I would not.
Why?
I'd be jealous that you might be prettier than I am.
I would be, too. I'd be hot.
they're not gay, they're not homosexual.
they are abominations unto the Lord.
they are sodomites.
this kid is Patrick Stephenson's son?
it would explain why Patrick Stephenson chose to disappear the way he did.
unashamed, they perform deeds that led them into the hands of an angry God.
now this is a fairly well-known moment, even though it was never televised. Watch.
it is this ignorance to the light of God that led to their doom.
I can't do this anymore.
I can't.
I preach against sins, sins I hate, but other sins such as greed...
greed.
this is a palace, and I am a prince.
I am not like my father...
and I am not like my mother.
I just want to do God's work, not perform on television...
bilk you for your money.
God bless us all.
God forgive us all.
ironically, he was just like his father.
you think he switched sexes, too?
no, no, they both turned their backs on this kind of commercial worship.
they both went out into the world looking for redemption.
I assume you're gonna search out Ryan Stephenson?
I work at the FBI. That's what we do.
it's a big country, and we'll try.
well, concentrate your search in hospitals, halfway houses, uh, rehab centers, jails.
you think things have gone that badly for him?
no, no, he's not an inmate or a patient.
Ryan Stephenson is literally atoning for the sins of his father.
he left the palace for the street.
he's following the teachings of Jesus.
his mother sayschings he's in California.
no, she's wrong. This kid, he's the prodigal son.
I'll bet he's within 20 miles of that giant church he fled as a confused adolescent.
I'll take that bet. - All right, how much?
20 bucks. - Deal.
deal. 20 dollars.
thank you. - There you go.
thank you.
if you're making the wager, how come I get the money?
you're the bank.
you're the bank, lady.
this comminuted fracture on the pelvis is very similar to the blow to the skull.
both blows were inflicted while Patricia Ludmuller was still alive.
she was swimming, she was struck on the head, she drowned.
then how were her fingers damaged and how was she cut in half?
wow, you ask extremely difficult questions.
the particulates found in both the skull wound and the pelvis are fiber-reinforced polymers and hydrocarbon secretion of coniferous trees.
which is what, exactly?
fiberglass and resin.
okay, she was struck by a boat, the keel of a boat.
now we're getting somewhere.
anything on the metacarpals?
you mean, could I tell what hit her fingers? No.
it was either something that didn't leave traces or the water rubbed away all the evidence.
we'll show these images to Dr. Brennan.
Why?
she'll see something you missed.
so that's Ryan Stephenson?
Yep. Found him in a detox center in Silver Spring.
a patient? - Nope, counselor. You called it.
you owe me 20 bucks. - Get it from Bones.
are you sure it was my father?
Yes, I'm positive.
they told me Dad died in Thailand.
well, he, uh...
well, she seemed to have found peace up there on the island.
named his church "Inclusion"?
Yeah.
he welcomed drug addicts, prostitutes, homosexuals.
according to her congregation, who loved her, your father welcomed everyone.
what? You afraid your father's gonna burn in hell?
no.
no, I just wish I had the chance to know the new him...
her.
I'm a suspect?
you thought perhaps I found out my father was a fraud who had a sex change and that God asked me to kill him?
did God tell you to kill your dad?
I've changed.
do you believe in redemption?
Yes, I do.
one of God's challenges to us is to see past the surface.
to the deeper, essential nature which lies right beneath.
you believe our bodies are like dustcovers?
that's exactly what I think, Agent Booth.
rip them off and see what's underneath.
you see, all this time I thought my father was killed or...
had abandoned me, and that's just not what happened.
he didn't want to shake my faith.
he was protecting me from the truth. He...
he didn't want me to have to choose between him and God, and I love my father for that.
I just hope God can forgive me for making him feel that way.
do you think I could have my father's Bible?
I'm afraid it's still evidence.
but, hey, we figure out who killed your father, we'll make sure you get that.
thank you.
you ever consider returning to the ministry, Ryan?
okay, so we know Patricia Ludmuller was run over by a boat.
the boat struck her in two places-- the skull and the pelvic bone.
we found traces of enamel paint and stain filler, specifically Silver Neptune Mahogany and Lead Red Primer.
it was a foggy day, she was out there swimming alone.
this death could have been accidental.
or hit-and-run.
no. It was murder.
only one percent of deaths are murders.
Hodgins, you found pieces of splintered wood from the keel, both in the skull and the pelvic bone.
Yeah, from a wooden- keeled, shallow-hulled speedboat.
the splinters are embedded in the skull from this direction.
struck from behind.
and in the pelvic bone from this direction, at a 90-degree angle.
the boat hit her skull from behind, while she was facedown in the water.
the second blow hit her from the side, and she was on her back in the water.
she was struck once, then the boat turned around to make sure she was dead.
then hurt, disoriented, she reached up to clasp the gunwale?
someone smashed her fingers, forcing her to let go.
then she floated on her back.
the boat left, then turned around and...
struck her again.
we know exactly how Patricia Ludmuller was murdered.
excuse me, Dr. Saroyan.
Yes, Vincent.
is there a way to quit working here without losing Dr. Brennan as my grad supervisor?
I see. You'd like to quit this internship without losing your academic standing.
Yeah.
can I ask why?
it's absolutely impossible to kiss your own elbow.
and how is that relevant?
it isn't, Dr. Saroyan, but, um...
I'm someone who loves knowledge, and all of you are very narrowly focused.
it's a good focus, I know, catching murderers, but, um, all in all,
I'd rather be like me than like you, so if you can help me out...
I'll take care of it with Dr. Brennan.
we'll move on to another intern.
did you know that over 98% of people will respond with "Thank you" if you say,"You're welcome"?
you're welcome. - Thank you.
vino Delectable.
based on size, wood grain and shape of the keel,
Hodgins and Angela narrowed our search down to two models.
it's a Lee Shore Island and a Bow Wave Runabout. Okay?
so... How'd she end up split in two?
you mean, how did a man become a woman?
no, Bones, her spine was severed.
Oh, the polymer Hodgins found was probably fishing line, so she...
sinks, decomposes and the fishing line severs the spinal column.
Oh, some fisherman thinks a big one got away.
you think it means anything?
she lived her life split in two, then in death, split in two again.
no. I don't think it means anything. - I didn't think you would.
Hey, Dr. Hodgins, over here. Over here.
that's JP's?
why is the church group in a tizzy?
that's JP's boat.
wow, JP, this here is one fine vessel. Isn't it, Bones?
Yes. - Look at that, huh?
flush mount, single lever control box.
check this out, Bones, huh?
he's got a wiring harness under there.
bench seats with marine vinyl seat cushions. This is just classic.
how long have you had this for? - Years.
I only started restoring it after I joined the church.
the pastor said it'd be a good project for me.
did you take it out the day Patricia Ludmuller disappeared?
no.
this is definitely the boat that struck Patricia Ludmuller.
what?
twice.
couldn't deal with the rejection, JP?
our psychological expert says that many men freak out when they find out the woman they've been sleeping with used to be a man.
we never slept together.
I wanted to. I wanted her. She wanted me.
but she refused. I'm still married.
that why you ran her down?
this is where you smashed her hand.
No! Will you stop saying these things?
she must have been in a lot of pain when she grabbed the side of the boat.
I'm sure we'll find what he used to smash her fingers right here in the boat.
my guess is this.
bones, these seats-- they aren't adjustable.
how tall do you think JP is?
190 to 195 centimeters.
just give me a simple height.
six three or four?
how about his wife?
Oh, perhaps 100 and... Five foot two.
that's all I need. Thanks.
JP, you didn't restore this boat for yourself, did you?
pastor Patricia said I should do something for someone else.
someone I love.
then you should have built it for her.
I waited for you to get out of prison, and I waited for you to get sober.
and I waited for you to get tired of this stupid church.
and all you did was fall in love with another woman.
I never slept with her, Rita.
I don't believe that.
I'll never believe that.
Rita Gratton, I'm placing you under arrest...
for the murder of Patricia Ludmuller.
I think I should begin my first sermon to you as kind of an introduction.
my name is Ryan Stephenson.
I'm a child of man.
I'm a child of woman.
but more importantly, I'm a child of God, and as I look around I see others like me.
we don't look alike.
none of us look alike.
on the outside, we are gay and straight, black and white, fat and thin, man and woman, saint and sinner.
should I keep going, or do you guys catch my drift?
but inside...
inside we are all the same.
that is completely incorrect. - Not now, Bones.
our skeletons are wildly different or I wouldn't have a job.
just listen.
I am sorry that I didn't get to know my father-- Patricia.
but I hope I will find him... her...
that redeemed human being...
both in her old Bible and, more importantly, in you, the people who she loved
and - What?
I heard there's an 80-foot tall black walnut tree back here.
Uh-huh.
we can get 15 grand for just one tree.
this is government property.
the road said "closed" in big red letters.
so, we get in, we get the wood, we get out.
is this it?
what are you, a moron?
this tree is coniferous.
Carnivorous? What?
it eats meat?
no, numb nuts.
needles and cones.
Oh.
those don't look like cones to me.
how could you have hired him?
your father was the best candidate.
are you sure? Dad is an excellent liar.
he's also an excellent science teacher.
I called the school where he taught...
well, 15 years ago.
and after 15 years, they still remember him.
they named their lab after your dad.
I thought you'd be pleased.
well, you were incorrect.
is there a probation period?
Yes.
well, what would please me is if you terminated him at the end of that time.
okay, kids, everybody put on their goggles.
Hello?
Hi, honey. Hey.
okay, ready...
aim, fire.
the light refracted.
Yeah, now why is the light visible?
because the Jell-O molecules are close together.
Yeah, but that's not magic, that's...
Max K, the Science Way.
science Squad, meet my daughter, the world famous anthropologist,
Dr. Temperance Brennan.
of course, I taught her everything she knows.
actually, I went to college.
I have multiple degrees.
well, tell the kids a little something about refraction.
Snell's Law states that the angle of incidence is related to the angle of refraction, where V equals the wave velocities through the respective media and N equals...
nifty. That's very nifty.
but what was your favorite example when you were a kid?
rainbows.
I love rainbows. - Yeah, rainbows.
she used to make me drive her all the way across town, to the other side of the rainbow because she didn't believe that light came out of the back of a raindrop.
Yeah.
Yeah.
so, are there any questions for our scientist?
Ooh, me.
me, me, me. - I have to go examine the frontal bone of a dead person's skull.
maybe another time, kids.
gee, dead person's skull.
ain't that a kick in the head.
most likely a wind deposited them there.
hmm. That seems most likely.
well, the bones didn't come from the ground, and they didn't come from the sky, that leaves the wind.
those people over there need to clear out.
okay, well, those people over there are looking for the rest of that.
they are right in the middle of the masked booby migration path.
masked booby? You're kidding.
the Department of Fish and Wildlife does not kid, Agent Booth.
okay, you just have to give me a minute, okay, and you can have your boobies all to yourself.
what do we got?
this one's a portion of the sacrum.
definitely human.
there's char marks.
Oh, God.
you know I hate when you sniff and smell dead things.
fresh burn.
days or weeks rather than months.
I found a hyoid. - Oh, he found a hyoid.
dead guy's hyoid.
guy" as in the sexually nonspecific urban colloquialism or in reference to the gender normally associated with a penis, Mr. Bray?
the penis.
similar char marks.
any fires in the last couple weeks?
no.
the body of the hyoid is fractured.
strangulation.
this man was murdered. We'll need to search this entire area.
according to my scientists, your boobies are out of luck.
Hey, good afternoon, Agent Booth.
wish I could stay and chat, but I gotta go pick up my new employment ID.
Ooh, guns of steel.
you work here now?
Max, you...
you work here now?
I can still make out the accelerant pour pattern
victim must have been doused postmortem.
I'll have Hodgins run it through the mass spec.
your dad works here now?
not my idea.
she wants me to fire him.
Why?
this is a crime lab.
my father is a bank robber and an accused murderer.
Booth's killed more people than Max has and he works here.
don't bring that up. Why'd you have to bring that up?
in fact, Dr. Brennan, you've also killed a person.
and I'll point out, Max was never convicted.
so, in the eyes of the law, he's never killed anyone.
why are you defending him?
why aren't you?
he is your father.
whose sperm hit whose egg shouldn't determine who works here.
come on. He's showing kids around the museum.
what can it hurt?
let's get to work, please.
nothing definitive on cause of death.
of course we don't have a lot to work with.
I did find an anomaly.
the victim suffered a compression fracture sometime between three and six months prior to his death.
why is that an anomaly?
compression fractures are normally associated with osteoporosis, but the sacral vertebrae haven't even undergone final fusing.
not even 30 years old.
the fracture must have been the result of trauma.
a motor vehicle accident, parachute jumping.
it would have been very painful.
20-something with a bad back.
you gotta give me something here more to go on, Bones.
I would love to give you more, Booth, - but that would involve fantasy, which would be futile. - Dr. Saroyan.
excellent. I'll check my e-mail.
it's your lucky day, Booth.
we ran the victim's bone marrow.
we got a hit on the Armed Forces DNA Registry.
here's your guy.
force Recon. Marine Corps Special Ops, toughest of the tough.
the kind that parachute out of airplanes and get vertebral compression fractures?
you know what? You are a genius, okay?
did the Marine Corps say where this guy got to?
they don't know.
warren was honorably discharged three years ago.
Marines tried to track him down, see if he wanted to re-up, even checked his credit cards and bank accounts, but he's totally off the grid.
would his back be bad enough to medicate?
Yes. - Okay, fine. I'll just order a search of the controlled substance database, and I'll see if I can get an address.
you guys can go back to your bone play.
can you believe how light this thing is?
I'd say six grams.
no way these bones were burned in an ordinary wood fire.
a wood fire burns at 800 degrees Fahrenheit.
human flesh needs 1, 400 to ignite.
why do you know that?
I got an uncle who's a funeral director.
crematorium will incinerate a grown man down to five or six pounds.
these weren't cremated. The bones would be drier, and the flesh would be completely gone.
meaning that the burn was hotter than a wood fire and cooler than a crematorium.
that's a thousand-degree range.
I may be able to I. D. the accelerant.
I think we need a broader picture of the burn conditions.
how are you gonna do that?
we could experiment.
Oh.
Oh, is that what you're after here?
you'll recall I mostly disapproved of your experiments with Dr. Addy.
you didn't disapprove the results.
you have me there, Dr. Hodgins.
I can't tell if we're doing an experiment or not.
not.
see, I...
I don't see what the problem is.
it's a crime lab. You're a convicted felon.
your presence taints the evidence.
but I'm not gonna be around any evidence.
basically, I'm just gonna be firing lasers through stuff.
Oh, look, there's the doc that told the jury that I was a sociopath. Hey.
please, sit down, Doc. How are you?
likeable sociopath.
so, Cam wants Hodgins to design an experiment to figure out how hot a fire was.
Yeah. How hot a fire was that burned a body.
what body?
the bones in the tree-murder victim.
which is a crime we cannot discuss.
Yeah, but I know exactly how that experiment should go.
you aren't adequately credentialed to design an experiment, Dad.
can I ask what's really going on between you?
Tempy doesn't want me working at the Jeffersonian.
Why?
it's a conflict of interest.
we catch criminals, my dad is a criminal.
that would be valid... - Thank you.
...if it were your real reason, but it's not.
Yeah, yes, it is.
no, it's not.
Yeah, yes, it is. - No.
no. - Yeah-huh.
no, it's not. - Mm-hmm.
no. And-and this can't be resolved between you until you confront the real reason behind your feeling.
what do you say it is?
well, at the time you abandoned your daughter 15 years ago, you were a well-regarded science teacher. Now...
here you are basically in the same situation.
and subconsciously, she doesn't want to risk feeling that sense of abandonment and bereavement again.
that is such a load of crap.
you are far too rational for that.
exactly.
FBI got a hit off the controlled substances database.
I just got off the phone with Booth.
Cal Warren had a prescription for Oxycodone written by a Dr. Antonia Ezralow. Office in Chevy Chase.
could she provide an address?
Dr. Ezralow has never heard of Calvin Warren.
Plus, she's a dermatologist.
very rarely writes prescriptions for pain medication.
so he probably stole her prescription pad.
here's his MySpace page, and I have to say he doesn't look much like a drug dealer.
what a waste.
tall, dark, handsome and dead.
too bad he's blocking his address.
well, let's see. This is the house across the street.
now, if I were a house number, I'd be right about here.
I crop it so all we got is the reflection.
reverse and resize.
tweak the contrast, find some edges.
so he's across the street from 3294, but what street?
well, 1880-ish architecture, 面朝海湾广场。
let's assume the D. C. area.
check out the lamppost.
Yeah. It places us in one of the two historical districts where they still use those cast iron modified bishop's crook street lamps.
for an artist, you make a pretty good detective.
I think you just insulted me.
okay.
now, I do a search for 3294 in those two zip codes, and I come up with...
mad skills, babe.
the landlord said that Cal Warren worked crazy hours, you know, he kept to himself.
every time the landlord asked him, you know, what he did for a living, he always dodged the question.
maybe he liked his privacy.
what? So much that he pays his rent in cash?
I don't know, Bones, something is weird. It's not right.
there's no letters, no photographs, not even a bill.
so did you persuade Cam to fire Max?
what, you think my dad should be allowed to work at the Jeffersonian?
well, what, you know, she's just, you know, trying to do you a favor.
well, I didn't ask for a favor.
sometimes you don't need to ask.
got a passport.
this guy's been to countries I haven't even heard of.
what is this?
I don't know.
foreign currency, lots of it.
booth found this in tall, dark and handsome drawer.
hmm. It's an RF proximity card.
and that would be...?
basically, it's a super fancy key card.
you wave the card in front of the reader, it logs your info and the door opens.
any way to figure out what door it opens?
well, if the info on the card isn't too heavily encrypted.
I heard you tried to get Hodgins interested in doing an experiment.
let's just say I planted the seed.
what? CIA? NSA?
no.
dupont Circle.
special Agent Booth, FBI.
welcome to the Woodbury School, Agent Booth.
Hi, how are you? What's with all the security?
it's precautionary.
our student body includes children of diplomats, heads of state, CEOs.
how old is your child?
Parker? Uh, he's seven.
has he been evaluated?
he does just fine.
most applicant families engage an educational consultant.
I mean, it's not a requirement, of course, but...
I-I...Mr. Donnegan, I think you got this all wrong.
I know it seems crazy, but given the demand, we can only accept the most qualified applicants.
Parker's a great kid.
the problem is keeping him that way, isn't it?
68% of our students matriculate to Ivy League universities.
and it's not because of our electron microscope or AP classes.
it's because of our Honor Code.
any violation results in immediate dismissal.
now, why don't I get you an admissions packet?
actually, I'm...
I'm here because of a murder investigation.
I'm sorry?
one of your parking lot access cards was found in the apartment of a victim, Cal Warren.
he's not a parent or an employee. I would know the name.
maybe we can check your computer.
of course.
no one is issued a key card without security clearance.
one of our fathers actually implemented the security system.
he's deputy director of the CIA.
Really? - Mm-hmm.
there he is-- Calvin Warren.
did he happen to work for the CIA?
no, actually, he works for the president.
of the United States?
parents Association.
as a nanny.
a nanny.
28 grand a year.
I didn't pay that much for four years of college.
if you think it's so ridiculous, why did you save the application?
I didn't save it.
I just didn't have a chance to throw it out yet.
you don't have to be embarrassed.
it's perfectly normal to want the best for Parker.
public school was good enough for me, it's good enough for my kid.
of course it is. Probably.
what's that supposed to mean?
you know, Parker is a bright, engaged little boy.
I'm sure he'll do fine in a large classroom.
I did.
except...
except what?
your dad was a science teacher.
you're a scientist.
Yes, my education was enriched at home.
that's what I got to do.
enrich Parker at home.
in what academics are you qualified to offer enrichment?
well...
Ethel, could you grab my bag, please?
I am on my way to the Children First board meeting.
thank you.
Oh, Wexler has the groomer at three.
excuse me. Elsbeth King?
yes?
we're with the FBI.
do you know a Mr. Calvin Warren?
he was my nanny.
what happened?
that's exactly what we're investigating.
Cal dropped off the face of the earth on Sunday.
he was an excellent nanny.
well, how is it that an ex-Special Ops guy becomes a nanny?
my husband, Richard, handles defense contracts.
the Middle East, South America.
there were kidnap threats a couple years ago, and Richard was concerned.
he offered Cal $2, 500 a week.
that's very good pay for a babysitter.
Cal was more like a bodyguard.
do you suppose that's what got him killed?
someone after my children?
could we speak to your children?
of course.
okay, so what time on Sunday did you last see Cal?
Why?
because it's pertinent to our investigation.
wei shen me ta wen zhe ge wen ti?
bu zhi dao.
what?
mandarin Chinese.
my father says the Chinese will run the planet in ten years.
he figures it'll be useful.
that's very smart.
okay, well, here, today, okay, I run the world.
bun tyen-shung duh ee-dway ro.
he just called you a stupid, inbred stack of meat.
Really?
I'm sorry, do you have something to say to me?
DUI bu qi.
xie xie.
he-he apologized.
good. So, you want to tell me what happened on Sunday?
well, Cal dropped me off at the algebra tutor around 8: 00
and then took Lexie to check out a new horse.
in the afternoon, you had a game against All Saints.
lacrosse.
I got this.
let's see. Oh.
and Cal took you to the emergency room?
no. He knew one of the moms was a doctor, so he figured she'd do a better job.
looks like the work of a plastic surgeon.
no, dermatologist.
Dr. Ezralow.
very competent.
the Royce boy was stitched up by the same doctor who said she didn't know Cal Warren.
Mm-hmm, I'm having her brought in for questioning.
you think those kids are better off than Parker?
Yeah, of course they are.
they have every advantage: a wonderful school, a successful father, mother committed to charity work.
I spend more time with my houseplants than they do with their kids.
well, children of privilege have always been raised by staff.
it's how the upper one percent stays the upper one percent.
assuming quality education and adequate supervision, parents are actually rather irrelevant beyond a certain age.
you're kidding me.
look at this.
they start Latin in third grade.
that's fantastic.
no. You know what's more important than academic enrichment?
a loving environment. You ask anyone.
Parker is a wonderful child, Booth.
you shouldn't feel inadequate.
Yeah, well, I'm perfectly capable of raising my own kid.
you're being defensive.
I am not.
it's because you only have one child.
when you procreate in multiples, there's less pressure.
thank you.
I feel much better.
this way.
have a seat.
I apologize, Agent Booth.
when you called and asked if I knew a Calvin Warren,
I just didn't put it together with the King's nanny.
Oh, so you did know him?
Yes. But just as Cal.
my son is on the same lacrosse team as the King boy.
did you have any more dealings with him?
I'm afraid not.
actually, no, that's not true.
I'm sorry, again.
Calvin came along with us one time when I took the, uh, King children up for a ride.
a ride?
I'm a pilot.
I own a Seneca Five.
Cal got sick, and, well, the boys thought that was hilarious.
you wouldn't happen to know how Cal Warren got a prescription for painkillers from you?
um... Isn't that obvious?
that's why he brought Royce King to me to be stitched up.
to steal my prescription pad.
I have no further questions, so, you know, thanks for coming in.
I just feel stupid for not being able to put the face with the name.
I'm so sorry for wasting your time.
no worries. Have a nice day.
Hey.
so you know that thing where you insist that all information goes through you?
Yes, and I'm afraid I'm immovable on the subject.
and you send out little e-mails summarizing the case so far?
Yes, plus I check those e-mails to see if they've been opened.
that's a very good system.
thank you.
because if you weren't checking,
I probably never would have read the e-mail that said
booth questioned a flying dermatologist.
I hope you're not trying to get some free lotion.
I ran the accelerant sample through the GC mass spec.
there were traces of tetra-ethyl lead.
have we changed the subject?
no, because if you hadn't been so anal about the e-mails,
I never would have known that I discovered something that wasn't merely interesting but vital to the investigation.
which is tetra- ethyl lead?
tetra-ethyl lead was a common antiknock additive in gasoline that went out with catalytic converters and unleaded gas.
does the flying dermatologist drive a vintage car?
maybe. But for sure, the flying dermatologist flies a plane.
aviation gas?
the victim's remains were incinerated by aviation gas.
I'll let Booth know.
hopefully, she hasn't flown the coop while you were getting to the point.
I was just trying to be nice.
you lied to me.
Yes.
I wrote Cal a prescription for painkillers.
I shouldn't have.
that's the truth.
Yeah, but not this time, Doc.
now that I know that you're a world-class liar,
I came just a little bit more prepared this time.
take a look at that there.
my flight logs... - Mm-hmm.
...for the past year.
Yeah. - Mm.
Oh, looky here, this one here.
right here.
Yes, I took Cal flying a few times.
without the kids?
this one here is my favorite.
this particular flight to New York.
you were gone the whole weekend.
all right.
all right, I'll tell you what you want to know.
no, my husband didn't know I was having an affair with the Kings' nanny.
would I have killed Cal to prevent him from finding out?
no, I would not.
Why? Because my husband doesn't give a damn who I boff.
do I know anyone else who might wish Cal ill?
Yes.
don't stop, this is great.
keep going.
Cal told me to sell a stock.
he said he had some insider knowledge that, uh, this company was in trouble.
I took the tip, made a killing.
that's when I flew him to New York to say thank you.
and he said "you're welcome" all weekend.
what's this have to do with Richard King?
how's that look, Max?
good, looks good.
never thought I'd be doing another experiment.
dad, what are you doing in here?
Max had a great idea for an experiment.
dad, you said you wouldn't touch evidence.
he's been very careful not to touch the evidence, Dr. Brennan.
you know, your old man, he reminded me why I got into science.
to catch murderers? - No.
to figure stuff out in amusing ways.
the bones were incinerated by aviation fuel.
they just need to know, uh, how strong the wind was-- basic.
so, figure out how big a wind blew the bones...
check the weather charts.
basic, that's very basic.
but this is the same wind tunnel you helped me build for the science fair.
right, yeah, a basic wind tunnel, honey.
you won first prize.
I made casts that weigh the same as the bones we found in that tree.
all right, now...
we put the skull cast into the wind tunnel since that was the largest artifact on the tree.
I didn't touch anything.
the bone begins to move at wind speeds of 42 miles per hour.
not enough net force to achieve aerodynamic lift.
but crank it to 69...
I checked the National Weather Service.
there were windstorms in that area last week.
a strong nor'easter hit 71 miles per hour late last Tuesday.
that gives us a 48-hour windor Calvin Warren's murder.
but we still don't know where he was killed or where the body was dumped.
wait a minute, I can figure that out.
dad, you're fired.
what?
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
the NOAA tracks surface conditions.
we can calculate where the bones started out if we can plot approximate mass and reverse the path of that nor'easterly.
the heavier remains will still be near the original dump site.
you see, I'm helping.
Oh, most definitely is helping.
I'm sorry, Dad, but you're fired.
you took part in a forensic experiment.
you said you wouldn't, but you did, so now you're fired.
Dr. Brennan, he didn't touch any of the evidence.
it's okay, kid. Never mind.
nice assist, Mick.
now take him out quick.
no, Mick!
Hi, Alexa. How are you?
shouldn't you be, like, studying algebra or Chinese or solving the world's problems?
I'm cheering for Royce.
he's the goalie.
I watch football. You know, it's a better sport.
it's American.
lacrosse was invented by the American Indian.
you can't get much more American than that.
Hi.
Oh, God, what now?
well, I'm just thinking about this whole insider trading thing.
I told you everything.
I'm thinking Cal, you know, gives you a tip on a stock, you sell it, you make $2 million, $3 million, and, uh, it raises questions in my mind.
how did Richard King find out that Cal spilled insider knowledge?
that's right, Bones.
I don't know.
well, where were you between last Sunday and Tuesday night?
who is she?
don't get jealous, Doc. Just answer the question.
I was in San Antonio doing skin grafts on a firefighter with third-degree burns.
you've got your own plane.
you had time to fly back.
you really want me to believe that Richard King killed Cal.
Cal Warren's remains were incinerated with aviation gas.
I didn't kill Cal.
you know what, she lies a lot.
I don't think she can help it at all.
here's my lawyer's card.
Oh. She's decided not to cooperate.
no, I've decided to watch my son play lacrosse.
okay. Here's the surface weather for Tuesday night when that nor'easter blew the bones into that tree.
now, that red X, that's the tree.
the bones must have traveled along this vector.
now, given the duration of the gust and the terrain obstacles, liftoff must have happened somewhere between here...
and here.
that's on the edge of Queen Anne's and Kent County.
good job-- excellent experiment.
don't thank me.
thank Max Brennan.
how's it going there, Max?
that's the last day with my kids this afternoon.
I'm toast.
cam fired you, huh?
no, no, Tempe fired me.
and don't tell me she hasn't got the authority, because, believe me, I feel fired.
sorry, Max.
can I ask you a question?
sure.
you, are you, uh...
are you sleeping with my daughter?
no.
Why? Are you gay?
no.
is she not attractive enough?
bones is beautiful.
is it because of me?
because I killed one man, and we both know he deserved it.
right, just cut it out, Max. All right, I'll talk to her.
probably ain't gonna get anywhere with her, but...
I'll talk to her.
you're a good man.
and I want that for her.
and now I got to go blow up some soda for some kids.
okay, according to the calculations, the bones must have started out from somewhere in this vicinity.
you know something, Bones? It's tough being a father.
Parker will be fine.
peer groups and random environmental factors are far more important than family.
how's that a good thing?
over here!
agent Booth, over here.
this must have been where the...
body was burned.
you think?
Femur...
pelvis... sternum.
gunshot trauma to the sternal angle.
the buckshot embedded in the anterior surface indicates that the murder weapon was a 12-gauge shotgun.
I thought Cal was strangled.
he was.
strangled, shot and set on fire.
Oh, someone wanted to make sure he didn't get home.
Hey, Bones, look at the family crest.
looks like that someone came from King's country home.
Mr. King, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your nanny.
I, uh, I-I really don't see how I can help you, Agent Booth.
my wife deals with the staff.
you own a 12-gauge shotgun?
Yeah, several.
you're welcome to examine them.
two months ago, Cal gave an investor insider knowledge about your company.
I didn't know that.
and if you had known?
I suppose I would have tried to fire him.
tried?
well, I don't think that Elsbeth would have allowed it.
Why? Was she having an affair with him?
Oh, Bones, such a good one.
you two need to learn focus.
excuse me?
focus. Focus.
either accuse me of killing Cal because he betrayed business secrets or because he had sex with my wife, and then once you've chosen, thencontact my lawyers.
I'd go with the business motive.
I'm very happily married.
okay, that guy is one cool customer.
Ooh, cool like a, like a murderer?
no. I don't know, okay?
I just don't see him losing his temper or taking on some Special Forces vet, that's all.
all right, do you think that dog comes with a saddle?
follow me, Bones, will you, for a second?
what's going on?
what are you doing?
are you going to urinate in the gas tank as an act of vandalism?
you kidding me, Bones? I would never do something like that this fine Italian automobile.
beautiful car. It's Italian, Bones. Just remember that.
italians make the best automobiles.
Yeah. There it is.
okay, Bones, give me, uh, one of your little baggies.
I didn't bring evidence bags.
Thanks, Bones. Appreciate it.
but we're not at a crime scene. Why would I bring evidence bags?
you always have evidence bags on you.
I've, um,
I've decided I'm gonna leave the Jeffersonian.
Why?
uh, because I fired him.
you can do that?
Oh, yeah. Believe me, she can do it.
well, it's all about proximity to forensic evidence.
don't take any offense, but that's a lot of crap.
it's about proximity to me.
right?
well, in my opinion, it isn't your father's presence that's causing you anxiety; it's the memory of his absence.
I can understand quantum mechanics, but I can't understand you.
well, make it easy.
I'm leaving the Jeffersonian.
you are?
but I'm staying with you.
what? Oh... in my house?
n-no, no.
why, is that an offer?
no. Would you...
would you want me to offer?
no, no, but thanks for the offer.
no, it wasn't an offer. It was just a question.
he isn't saying he's literally staying with you.
he's promising never to abandon you again.
I'm sorry, but if it wasn't for that evidence thing,
I'd, I'd let you keep your job.
that's simply not true.
Hey, it's all right.
we're good.
uh... nothing I say has any impact.
Ah, I should get back to work.
Oh, geez.
did she leave any money?
about the fractured hyoid...
yes?
I was just remembering about a tapeworm.
I am going to need more than that.
there was a tapeworm in the line. The one that went to the beer keg.
I was working as a bar back a couple years ago.
there's no flow from the tap line. First assumption: kink in the line, right?
what else could it be?
there was a tapeworm in the line.
eight inches long.
I learned something from that.
drink bottled beer?
the tap don't flow, you assume the line's got a kink.
the guy's hyoid is broken; you assume he died from getting strangled.
you found a tapeworm?
I mean, metaphorically?
Yeah, but I don't know if it's a tapeworm.
I need Dr. Brennan.
Dr. Saroyan...
I am so your most valuable player.
now, this is the profile of the accelerant we found on the bones.
aviation gas.
and this is the profile of the gas we took off Booth's tie.
richard King's car runs on avgas?
he could have siphoned it out of his own car to burn Cal Warren's remains.
and what is this anomaly?
citric acid?
it's my considered belief that Agent Booth spilled orange juice on his tie.
I look forward to seeing him explain that to the jury.
booth, it's Cam.
I think you're going to want to get yourself a warrant to arrest Richard King.
fractures on the transverse processes of the C2, both sides, and the spinous process.
and check out the occipital protuberance.
Oh, yes.
maybe this will help Booth keep Richard King in detention.
Cal wasn't strangled postmortem.
he was dragged.
strangulation is the kink, dragging is the tapeworm.
the pattern of marks is evenly spaced as if it were from a series of connected prongs.
what would do that?
a choke chain.
richard King's a big, strong guy.
I don't see him dragging a dead body around on a choke chain.
that's because he didn't.
the angle of the fracture is 18 degrees.
assuming a standard four-foot leash, whoever dragged the victim is at most five-five.
so, you're sure you don't want your attorney present, Mrs. King?
let's just get this over with.
okay, sounds good to me.
here's, uh, what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking that, uh, your country home is less than a mile from the spot where Cal's body was burned.
you had access to the shotgun, the aviation gas...
you know how many people work for us, Agent Booth?
every single one of them had access.
Yeah, but I don't think any of them really would have cared if they found out that, uh, Cal Warren was trying to destroy your husband's company.
you have a nice life.
I'm sure you got really angry when you found out that it was all going away.
hmm?
you don't understand.
it wasn't about the money.
I had to protect my family.
what do you think?
in my professional opinion, she didn't whack him.
what? Come on, Cal betrayed them.
come on, Sweets. For once, you're right.
embrace the win, my friend.
I'm sorry, but it's Kinesics 101.
you know, you pushed all the right buttons, but instead of her ego defense system triggering a stress-response state, she went straight into a tacit confession.
right, which means... she did it.
no, it means she didn't do it.
but she wants you to believe that she did.
why would she want to do that?
because she's covering for someone.
the only honest thing that she said was that she had to protect her family.
so we're back to square one.
sort of.
geez.
let me ask you something.
I mean, you're a smart guy, you went to private school, right?
Yeah. With perfect attendance through sixth grade, might I add.
that's great.
um, you don't think that I'm a lousy dad for not sending my son to private school?
no, but you'd be a lousy father if you didn't torture yourself about it.
Thanks.
Oh, hold on.
I reviewed the placement of the shotgun pellet wounds.
the trajectory indicates that whoever shot Cal was significantly shorter than Mrs. King.
I don't think she did it. - Right, thanks.
you see, we got a court order for your cell phone and your laptop.
you know nothing you text or IM is really private.
I knew that.
Really? Because, you know, we checked your text messages, and, uh, we found one from a couple weeks ago that's a little weird.
this one is from the night that Cal was killed.
bring it over now. Parents both gone.
stop this, Richard.
no, I want to hear it.
it turns out that Alexa, here, had a project due on Ancient Greece.
hmm, you spent three days complaining about it.
why didn't you just do it?
I didn't want to. It was stupid.
stupid?
Oh, how about this one?
d manny will do it. He can't say no. He works for me.
but Cal really did say no, didn't he?
because you paid a hundred bucks to somebody else to do it for you.
someone by the name of Dakota Shearcroft.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, I think it's a stupid name, too.
so what happened?
did Cal catch you?
he threatened to tell the school.
why wouldn't he have just told us?
Cal said you wouldn't do anything.
you never do.
he said I had to learn a lesson.
what kind of lesson?
they would have kicked me out of school!
zero tolerance.
my friends are at that school.
I got the gun out of the garage and I shot him.
mom came home and saw.
I drove the body to the country house, took it into the woods and burned it.
she's my daughter, I had to protect her.
no, you did what you always do.
make everything bad go away.
it's counterproductive to raise children in a world without consequences.
Oh, it looks like little Alexa here is going to have to come face-to-face with some pretty nasty consequences.
but not the kind of consequences you're going to have to face, Mrs. King.
okay, Parker, this is called the candy mint-soda experiment.
you can do this for your dad at home.
so, Mom copped to conspiracy to avoid a trial.
she'll spend some time in prison.
how much? - Not enough.
my opinion, she ruined that little girl's life.
what about the little girl?
removed from the family, institutionalized for a couple of years.
then it's back to ponies and tennis lessons?
Mm-hmm.
well, Caroline should charge her as an adult.
she's 11 years old, Bones.
Yeah, well, she's old enough to speak Chinese.
uh, they don't take that into account.
man, when that little girl killed Cal Warren, she killed the best father she had.
well, sometimes it's hard to appreciate what you've got.
you put the mints in the tube.
look at him-- Parker has never liked science before.
are you still thinking of sending him to Woodbury?
I torched the application.
I'm thinking there's something to be said for middle class.
you sure he's going to be all right?
sure.
well, probably.
probably, like, what do you mean, probably?
what the hell are they doing anyways?
disrupting the surface tension of a two-liter cola.
right.
is that the last one?
all right, put it in the tube.
and then we'll both take a step back.
don't fire Max. Let him keep his job.
you know he's a teacher, he's not a janitor.
I can't overlook the sanctity of the forensic lab, Booth.
Yeah, maybe you can overlook it for me.
for you?
Yeah.
personal favor.
what, like a partner thing?
a partner thing.
I know you, Booth.
you're trying to do me a favor by telling me it's a favor for you.
no.
uh-uh, no, I...
I can't afford that school.
I can't enrich Parker, not with the science thing, but...
you can. Max can.
do it again.
daddy! Daddy, look what I did!
I blew it up!
Yeah, I saw, little man.
look at my dad.
look at my...
boy there with your dad.
okay.
yes...
all right.
Thanks, Bones.
okay, give everything, my darling. Everything.
utter dross to upper-class gloss, all right?
keep her lit. Keep her bathed in the glow.
all, right, yes. Okay, good. Now, look up. All right. Yes. Nice. Okay.
right in front of you, that's it. That's the future. Yes, okay.
what the hell is that?
pigeons or blackbirds or crows. Something along those lines.
telephoto.
God, he has an idea.
this is what we need. Caw, caw, yeah, flap, flap. Flap, yeah, yeah.
give me more, yes. Aviary. Wings. Yes, beaks. Caw, caw, caw, caw, caw.
those creatures, they are death. Flap your arms.
chase death away but remain beautiful. You understand?
running through a vacant lot at a bunch of birds in six-inch heels...
Oh, that's it. Good, good, good! You're a leopard. Leap!
you're an angel! Oh, yes, beautiful! Beautiful. Terror, fear!
okay, gaze heavenward. Look at the beastly birds, my darling. Look up!
Oh, I love it, yes. Gaze heavenward, darling.
Yes, look up at the beastly birds!
Hey, so, what's it look like to you?
an ear.
did you just make a joke? - No.
cause that wouldn't be like you.
I didn't. It looks like an ear.
uh, what do you make of the stuff in the blue bag there?
looks like chili con carne.
could this be the rest of the person who lost the ear?
I don't know. It looks like chili con carne.
there's no single piece here bigger than the skull of an Australopithecus.
sports terms, Bones. Remember, we talked about this.
softball. Good. You're getting better. The size of a softball.
at first guess, the total mass in this garbage bag does not add up to an entire human being.
right, so I'll just get forensics to scour the entire lot.
Yes.
would you even want to guess what happened to this human being?
no. - I knew you'd say that. I just had to ask. You know.
all right, let's scour it up!
I've been a pathologist for 13 years and I admit, I am a little nauseated.
it's going to fall to me to empty these bags, isn't it?
all right, then. Fine. I may need a pot of tea waiting.
maggots place time of death somewhere between 48 and 72 hours.
I'm going to go with the wood chipper on this.
in that case, it was a gold wood chipper.
this looks like gold.
the ancient Sumerians were prone to spreading gold dust over the body during funeral rites.
did the Sumerians chop up the body into little, tiny bits first?
not to my knowledge. - What is this?
a black pearl?
pearls, symbolizing eggs or rebirth and resurrection, were used in many South Seas funeral rites.
did they chop up the bodies into little tiny bits first?
I've begun to apprehend your point, Dr. Saroyan.
find out how many corpses we're dealing with.
I'll find out if these are really gold flecks and pearl fragments.
celibacy is a lot like fasting.
so, you've become sexually anorexic?
at first, you're out of sorts and agitated, and then you sort of...
push through to a kind of clarity.
have you reached clarity?
no, I'm still at the agitated and horny stage.
why are you fasting sexually?
sweets thinks it will do me good to put sex on the back burner in order to relate to people in other...
why are you listening to Sweets?
Angela? I asked, why are you listening to Sweets?
sweetie, can you pay for this? I have to go.
sure. Why?
I have to save Hodgins' life.
I found something interesting on the cellular level.
I don't care about the cellular level.
no hemorrhagic tissue. - What?
means the victim was dead before being chopped up. You care about that, right?
no, not really. What I'm interested in is how this guy got chopped up.
now, this here shows that the cell burst from the inside out.
gives me nothing.
frostbite can do that.
Oh, like climbing a mountain? - Yes. Exactly.
the water in the cells crystallizes and explodes.
I have got an absolutely fascinating clue to tell you.
Hey, hey, uh, you have to leave town.
what? Why? - No, fascinating clue first.
the pearl we found in the victim wasn't a pearl.
why do I have to leave town? - My father is here.
what was it then?
carbonaceous chondrite. It's what meteorites are made of.
your father blames me for our break up?
well, he has sort of a blind spot when it comes to me.
so, I think you should just get out of town until I can call him off.
stop. Okay, stop it. Dead guy. What about the dead guy?
it's obvious.
he was frostbitten while climbing Everest, then struck by a meteor, then dumped into a vacant lot in two garbage bags, and eaten by crows.
all right, obvious. That's so obvious.
Hey, it's a start.
the slowest meteorites travel at 25, 000 miles per hour.
I'm not just spouting useless facts.
you do not have a chance of recreating those velocities with a glorified blow gun.
you simply want to fire a cannon at a dummy.
you staying or going?
another set of eyes and ears taking note can never be amiss.
what possible information could this experiment provide us that you couldn't get mathematically?
mathematics is theory.
this is a real world recreation.
in order to prove what, exactly?
that a, uh, frozen person, struck by a meteorite, would turn into chili con carne.
nasa has no record of a meteorite of this size and type striking North America at the time of death.
according to NASA, a meteorite matching these characteristics is right here in DC.
I'm all set up and everything.
your experiment is not pertinent.
so, you found out where the meteor came from?
from the solar nebula. - All right. Anything more current than that?
fire in the hole!
what the hell was that?
we're okay. Everything's fine.
we should get out of here before lockdown.
let Cam deal with it. -Yeah...
you know you're grounded, right?
so you think the piece of meteor we found in the murder victim came from this?
Yeah, it's an exact match.
the silicate oxide ratios are indistinguishable.
well, you've heard of Landis Collar, right? - Sure I have.
blind guy, world's leading expert in superconductivity.
do you even know what superconductivity is?
I know it's better than normal conductivity.
agent Booth, Dr. Brennan, I'm Christopher Beaudette, Senior Scholar here at the Collar.
shall we? - Yes.
so you work in superconductivity?
uh, no, Agent Booth, I'm doing research into generating power from earthquakes.
groundbreaking.
that was a funny joke.
Yeah, and one I've never, ever heard before.
are these people here smarter than you?
that would depend upon how one defines intelligence.
I'm Landis Collar.
thank you, Christopher. - Landis.
and I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth, this here is, uh...
Dr. Temperance Brennan.
is that clicking noise attached to your blindness, Dr. Collar?
Yes. It's a prototype.
sonic echo-locator.
it allows me to...
apprehend my surroundings.
have you forgiven me?
forgiven him?
I was turned down for a fellowship here at the Institute.
no, no, that is not true.
your anthropological research was rejected, because it looked at the past, not the future.
to eternity. To glory. To the future.
right. Then why say your motto in a dead, ancient language?
okay, Booth. - How can I help you?
uh, this-- Well, put your hand out, I'll-- There you go.
what Agent Booth has given you... - I know what it is.
it's a piece of my meteorite.
that's impressive for a blind man.
I know because I had it made for Diane.
the meteorite was set in her engagement ring.
well, that would explain the gold flecks.
what's happened? Is Diane all right?
when was the last time you, uh, saw Diane?
a few days ago. She was ill, which is understandable, - considering the pressure she's under. - Pressure?
she's Editor in Chief of the Collar Journal
perhaps the most important venue for scientific publishing in the world.
please, what has happened?
we have discovered some human remains, which contained...
we'd like to talk to anyone who may have interacted with Diane before she disappeared.
you must speak with Diane's students.
chief amongst them, Jennifer Keating and Milton Alvaredo.
I'll have Dr. Beaudette bring them to you.
if you need anything else, I'll be in my office.
my God, Dr. Sidman is dead?
we have not yet made a positive identification.
when was the last time you saw her, Milton?
um, I suffer from a kind of chronological dyslexia, which makes it very difficult for me to place discreet events accurately on a linear timeline.
this one's all yours.
what exactly are you working on?
I'm endeavoring to find a way to transmit single cell organisms, using common pond scum, from one location to another.
you ever try a spoon?
I've had some success vibrating two separate samples of single cell scum in complete symmetry on a quantum level.
that's very impressive.
you wouldn't understand, Booth.
of course I do. "Beam me up, Scotty."
very good, yes. Exactly.
Dr. Sidman must have been eager to publish that in the Journal.
very excited, yes. Pending a few questions.
is this publishing thing important?
publish or perish. - I mean, is it motive?
for murder you mean? Definitely. - Definitely.
but only on the level of vengeance.
killing her would not reverse the decision unless of course the person who killed her wanted to take over her position.
I last saw Diane when Jennifer asked us to stop arguing so loudly.
Jennifer Keating? Dr. Sidman's other grad student?
Yes. Jenny works in cosmogenic isotope research.
it can make her cranky.
this place is making me cranky.
I asked Milton to quiet down, not Diane.
I would never get mad at Diane.
Why?
she's Editor in Chief of the Journal.
publish or perish, right?
what were they arguing about?
I have no idea. Could've been about anything.
Landis encourages a free exchange of ideas and it can get pretty intense.
you specialize in cosmogenic isotope research?
Cosmogenic?
it's a new way of dating artifacts using 14C isotopes.
through accelerated mass spectroscopy.
Oh, that'd make me cranky, too.
I can't imagine that your project excited Diane Sidman.
look to the future.
carbon dating is all about the past.
you're right.
there was no way she was going to publish me.
this time next year, I'll be looking for post-graduate work.
is that the last time you saw Diane Sidman?
Yes, three days ago.
Why? Is something wrong?
it is possible that she is dead.
bones account for approximately 15% of the mass of a human being.
given that the total bone mass here comes to, uh, 8.9 kilograms, that would suggest a human being who weighed approximately 59. 33333333 kilograms.
131 pounds. Well, it matches the victim's stats.
Oh, it's Diane Sidman all right.
Dr. Saroyan got DNA confirmation.
there are no other particulates outside of the gold flecks and meteorite.
what did I tell you?
that we aren't allowed in the same room without supervision.
Why?
because we were stupid enough to fire a cannon indoors.
And?
I'll leave.
there's a deep pitting in these bones, which may or may not be connected to the fractures.
also, I excluded wood chipper as a possibility.
how?
whirling blades would create parallel and evenly spaced fractures.
these patterns appear to be completely random.
even more puzzling, they are unusually clean.
what if the cellular damage and the fractures were caused by the same thing?
the cells could have burst as a result of ice microcrystals having formed if the body was rapidly frozen.
you mean freeze the body and then shatter the bones?
liquid nitrogen?
you have my permission to confer with Dr. Hodgins on the subject.
uh, in the same room? Yes? Just to be clear.
any damages come out of your pay.
as requested: Diane's work area.
looks like somebody cleaned it out.
Oh, no, Booth, Dr. Sidman was a theoretical physicist.
she didn't do experiments, she figured everything out through equations.
Diane was a member of the Large Hadron Collider team.
isn't that-that thing in Europe that's going to create a black hole and end the universe?
there's only a very small chance of that actually occurring.
and yet, Diane received a number of death threats.
Diane Sidman's role was important to the Large Hadron Collider Team?
the effort to find the Higgs-Boson will be set back months.
the God particle? - What that's?
a theoretical particle which explains why matter has mass.
mass and matter aren't the same?
well, come on, don't look at each other like that.
I bet neither one of you know how to make your own beer.
you realize you just said "don't look at each other" to a blind man?
do you have records of threats made against her?
Yes, ever since one of our scientists was attacked for his work in cloning.
milton Alvaredo suggested that we look at whoever was going to replace Diane Sidman as Editor in Chief.
that would be the Senior Scholar-- Christopher Beaudette.
you can understand how that makes him a suspect.
I'll tell Sweets to look into the threats and see if they're worth following up.
if it matters, Diane and Christopher were also enjoying a sexual relationship.
if it matters?
I thought you were going to marry her.
at which time, by mutual agreement, Diane and Christopher's sexual relationship was to cease.
completely rational.
except for the completely insane part.
I'll be right back, Dr. Beaudette.
my opinion, it's a good thing they didn't accept you at that place.
Why?
it's creepy. Everyone there is creepy.
well, if you think they're creepy, then you must think I'm creepy.
well, you have a creepy mode, Bones.
very interesting man.
highly self-aware. Major league smarty-pants.
Ah, right, little brain checks in, the big brain checks out.
uh, I don't know what that means -- little brain, big brain.
he freely admits that he had an ongoing sexual relationship with the victim.
that little brain.
but... he denies ever having been "in love" with her.
what's with the hooked fingers?
well, he said "in love" very sarcastically.
like it was something that happened to "lower primates.
okay, who else was he sleeping with?
I didn't ask. - Why does that matter?
because maybe not everybody is so, you know, "adult,"
you know, or "rational."
or, hey,"clear thinking."
or "heartless" as him.
that was a lot of quotation marks.
so, sexual relationships are pretty casual over there at the, uh, Collar Institute, right?
we're young, close quarters, we stimulate each other.
who else were you sleeping with?
who was also seeing Milton.
so, is it possible that Jennifer was trying to get rid of a romantic rival?
by that retrograde manner of thought,
Landis could have killed Diane for sleeping with me or I could have killed Diane for sleeping with Landis or...
milton could have killed Diane for sleeping with me and Landis.
ladies and gentlemen, what I propose to show you today is how our victim's skeletal structure came to shatter into tiny bits.
Mr. Nigel-Murray.
he enjoys this way too much.
which is minus 21 Celsius or minus 346 degrees Fahrenheit.
it's unnecessary to say "degrees Celsius." It's implicit.
when I drop this supercooled turkey...
once again, technically not "supercooled."
it'll shatter into hundreds of bits on the concrete floor.
shards are gonna fly in every direction, so... Ready?
three... two... one!
I'm okay.
it's just a glancing blow.
I'm Dr. Lance Sweets.
I work for the FBI as a psychological profiler.
psychiatrist or psychologist?
he's just a psychologist.
uh, the point is, I looked through over 800 threats made against Dr. Diane Sidman.
you, Dr. Mullins, are the only person I thought merited questioning.
using psychology?
that's correct.
you might as well have picked my name from a hat.
normally, I'd agree.
but your disapproval of Dr. Sidman's work makes me wonder if you're a religious fanatic.
no. Like most reasonable human beings, I'm an agnostic.
you have a doctorate in physics from Princeton, right?
yet you work as a welder.
welding is a real job.
unlike psychology.
how can a reasonable human being with a physics degree honestly believe that a particle accelerator in Europe is going to create a black hole which will destroy the solar system?
would you like a list of Nobel Laureates who agree with me?
the odds are one in 50 million. Slight, I admit.
too high when you consider the loss of not only humanity, but the only planet in the cosmos that we know for certain is capable of generating and sustaining life.
um, I hate to say it, but I'm totally with him on this one.
would you kill someone on 50 million to one odds?
kill someone? Who's dead?
of the 800 threats I studied, 106 of them were from you.
evidence indicates that Diane Sidman was frozen using liquid nitrogen after she was killed.
then her body was dropped and shattered.
ridiculous. A frozen cadaver would simply bounce.
any moron should know that.
the point is, as a welder you have access to liquid nitrogen.
my IQ is 162.
what about it?
I'm smart enough to know when to shut up and ask for a lawyer.
except I've got one last thing to say.
knowing that Diane Sidman is dead,
I'm going to sleep about 50 million times better tonight.
I got here as soon as I could. What's up?
lab results from the CBC and biopsy on our victim.
abnormal proliferation of leukocytes in the thoracic and lumbar bone marrow.
these numbers are fatal.
she died of leukemia?
Diane Sidman had a full physical two weeks ago.
guess what?
clean bill of health.
how does a perfectly healthy young woman Leukemia doesn't just appear in two weeks.
leukemia
what about radiation?
there's got to be some source of radiation in that place that could cause cancer.
someone accidentally irradiates this poor woman, and then covers it up by freezing her and then smashing her remains into little...bits?
you know, ironically, intelligent people have been known to commit murders in ludicrously complicated ways, virtually ensuring their capture.
isn't that...
uh, it's Angela's dad.
it's not uncommon for men to fear their lover's male parent.
you know what creeps me out?
the way that English people say "lover."
you know, attacking Vincent like that clearly indicates that what he said is true.
the man is from Texas.
he told me that if I messed up...
uh, I don't remember what he said exactly, but he mentioned the key,"G Demolish,"
and it sounded pretty bad.
the blues is known as the Devil's music because those most adept are thought to have made a pact with the Devil, and thus fear no earthly law because they're already doomed to eternity in hell.
harsh.
thank you, Vincent.
I-I feel much better now.
I happen to have a great deal of insight into the whole blues culture.
I could talk to him for you.
Yeah, thanks, but, uh...too late.
have you found something?
the posterior of the T-seven.
it looks very smooth.
this indentation could very well be the result of a tumor.
the possible source of Diane Sidman's leukemia.
a tumor this size, over two weeks, would require a radiation source of between 1, 000 and 5, 000 REMs.
and that would have burned the victim. We would have seen that.
it must have been a steady exposure over time.
the woman spent almost all her time at work.
everything's coming up clean.
nothing?
Nope.
there should still be some evidence of radioactivity.
there is nothing radioactive in this room.
I don't know how you wear these things.
hot suits.
what?
right there.
what are you doing, Bones?
well, this stain here must have hit Diane Sidman almost exactly where the tumor formed.
you're testing me on the cancer chair?
well, you're wearing a suit.
Plus, it's not radioactive anymore.
we're going to need to take this chair.
no, no, no! You don't just go around doing human testing on people, Bones.
I got to go to the bathroom.
well, I touched it with my bare hands.
see?
you may be wondering why I'm going through these bones again.
probably because you feel bad that Dr. Brennan found evidence of a tumor that you missed.
the average chocolate bar has eight insect legs in it.
so-- she said hopefully-- metaphorically, you're looking for insect legs?
and I may have found some.
these cylindrical notches on the left clavicle.
see?
two of them, yes.
they may be stab wounds.
okay. We'll have Dr. Hodgins check them for microscopic particulates.
if he hasn't lit out for Timbuktu yet.
the discoloration in the fabric was not radioactive, but because of your suspicion, I tested for daughter isotopes.
daughter isotopes?
daughter isotopes are what's left behind after radioactive isotopes decay.
so, there was a radioactive isotope on Diane Sidman's chair.
Yeah, a strong one.
is anyone at that place doing cancer research?
no, it's not that kind of place.
Yeah, right.
to eternity, to glory, to the future.
you disapprove of the Collar Institute?
up and forward are only two directions.
science should look in all directions.
you taught me that.
I did?
every day.
thank you.
okay, hold on. Just get the door. - What?
get the door.
open it. - Now?
you got to be kidding me.
you know, it's like Club Med Mensa around here.
what are you laughing at?
you know, most people-- you bust in on them having sex with a gun, you know...
it kind of disrupts the mood.
perhaps they decided to start all over again from the beginning.
it's just sex, Booth.
it's not that. Look, I'm not a prude.
well, you have what they would call hang-ups.
you know that guy, Landis?
Yes.
he's about to make a move on you.
how do you know?
because it is the rational and smart thing to do, and he is all about that.
and I see how he looks at you.
how he looks at me?
he's blind.
that's too literal, Bones.
well, she's gone.
he has accepted it.
look, good people, they leave marks on each other.
the least we could do is let them fade away naturally, not, you know, scrape them off or paint over them with new marks.
so, you're not a prude?
moi?
Hey, I am a very fun and, uh...
very sexy guy.
so, you just think that if two people care about each other, they leave metaphorical marks which should be allowed to fade naturally?
you heard me, but you just didn't understand me.
I wonder that about you all the time.
my apologies.
were you looking for me?
we need to see your radioactive isotopes.
Hey, how you doing there, pal?
huh, did you knock one out of the park?
I'll be off then, Jennifer.
good-bye, Milton.
thank you very much.
you're more than welcome.
"thank you, Milton." "No, thank you, jennifer."
everyone is so polite here except for the murder and the cheating.
we can get a warrant for the isotopes if that's what you require.
that won't be necessary.
I don't know what use you could have with these.
I haven't used them for months, but...
something wrong?
some of my vials are missing.
we'll need to know how many people aside from yourself had access to them in the last month.
everyone in the institute had access.
everyone.
this guy is good.
he really is.
why would a guy like you play on a street corner?
well, I guess that depends on who exactly you think I am.
I'd like to speak to you about Hodgins.
I'd like to help.
no, thanks, son. I can handle Hodgins all on my own.
Oh, no. I mean, I'd...I'd like to help with the situation.
see, I'm a psychologist.
it's kind of my mojo.
you misunderstand the term.
what I meant was...
Vincent pointed out that each break appears to have happened at the weakest part in each bone.
x rays bear me out on that.
the most damage was done to the weakest bones:
the anvil, the hyoid, these points on the spine.
I don't get what that means.
essentially, the skeleton broke apart at the weakest points.
the way a building would fall apart during an earthquake.
so...
the victim was killed-- we're not positive how yet
then frozen, then shaken until all the bones fell apart?
not shaken.
vibrated.
vibrated until the frozen bones shattered like crystal.
don't sneak up like that.
I could put out an eye on my microscope.
you got to run.
you talked to Angela's father.
Oh, God. Well, what did he say?
I have no idea.
but he was very...
he's got a very disturbing affect-- sinister.
I am not scared of him.
okay, okay. You know that whole...
that whole "sell your soul at the crossroads" thing?
I'm buying it.
you got to run for it, man.
I told you so.
Yeah.
Hey, you know what? I secretly had a thing for Angela.
now it's gone.
Like-like...wiped from the memory banks.
so, it had to be Milton Alvaredo, right?
Why?
he's the one who's working on transporting matter through vibrations, right?
you understood that?
he kills Dr. Sidman, flash-freezes her, and then tries to transport her to outer space, the moon, whatever, and ends up with frozen chili con carne.
I'm very impressed, Booth.
Yeah, well, you know, I've learned a lot from you...
and a lot from watching the Discovery Channel with Parker.
milton Alvaredo is not our only suspect.
well, I mean, her only motive is revenge, and, you know, like you say, that's just not logical, and despite her being, you know, a sex kitten scientist, she's still logical.
no, not Jennifer Keating.
his project concerns extracting energy from earthquakes.
Plus, Dr. Collar is working on echolocation for the blind.
so, basically, we're back to square one.
well, I suggest we find an apparatus capable of shattering a flash-frozen human cadaver.
apparatus. - Yep.
right, gotcha.
Hello?
Dr. Earthquake?
okay, so, tell me what I'm looking for here.
any apparatus that might facilitate the creation of a sonic standing wave.
right. Tell me what I'm looking for again.
you're leaning on it.
right. I knew that.
all right. Look at this.
all right, I'll just get, uh, Forensics to, uh, look for blood.
no, there won't be any blood.
the remains are frozen solid by this point.
the natural frequency of the human body is between three and seven Hertz.
humans have natural frequencies?
naturally, that would increase dramatically if the body is frozen solid.
forget it, Booth. We're in a high pressure chamber.
that door can withstand a force of at least...
Oh, no. - Oh, no? What oh, no?
we have to get out of here.
we have to get out of here or what, we'll explode?
booth, what we have to do here is, we have to try to counteract the-the wavelength.
the what?
it's not working.
if we stop, our brains will turn to pudding.
Hello?
booth, are you okay?
are you all right?
can you hear me? - What?
are you all right? - Oh, I'm all right.
how about you?
I called paramedics. They should be here any second.
Landis pulled us out.
I heard shots.
booth, are you okay?
it was my shooting that saved our lives.
you should have been dead in five to seven seconds.
bones, it was my gun.
my sonic interference idea worked.
it wasn't your siren...
can you hear me?
bones, it was my gun. - If I hadn't started interference, we'd be dead before you started shooting.
you two might want to try resting before communicating.
don't need to be deaf as well as blind.
what?
all right, now, this notch you found in the clavicle? - Yeah?
I found minute traces of graphite, clay and copolymer.
pencil lead?
which, of course, is not lead at all.
uh, is that even possible?
all right, say a fairly heavy mechanical pencil, right?
to the windpipe, or the carotid
victim dies, is deep frozen, and then shattered.
uh, the, uh, freeze-dried chunks are swept into garbage bags and dumped for birds to eat.
Oh, no, please. You keep it.
I don't think I could ever regard it in the same manner again since...
thank you very much.
I warned the man, Angie.
I told him if he hurt you, he would have me to contend with.
did you take off your glasses when you said it?
I definitely did.
it was a mutual breakup.
were you hurt?
dad...
could he have stopped it?
Yeah. Yeah.
but so could I.
well, his daddy can come down and kick your ass.
I can't do everybody's job.
I wish you wouldn't.
okay, Sweet Girl.
I will ameliorate my vengeful intentions.
Ameliorate?
honest?
honest.
honest as a Texas sundown.
one of you killed Diane Sidman.
and tried to kill us.
I think we can rule out sexual jealousy as a motive for this murder?
of course we can.
Yeah, of course we can.
wait a second. Why? Because these robots don't feel like humans?
no, because radiation poisoning is the opposite of a crime of passion.
well, my people say that Diane Sidman was stabbed to death with a pencil.
well, indicating that the murderer suddenly became impatient, or approached a deadline.
you figure out that deadline, you'll figure out your murderer.
well it has to be the publishing deadline from the Journal.
look at this, huh?
found blood in your resonance chamber.
obviously, you can't see that, but it's right there.
that's not blood. That's not blood.
luminol means blood.
there's no evidence of smearing.
if the murderer had seen blood, he'd have cleaned it up.
luminol reacts with copper, iron peroxides and cyanide.
which provides for a number of false positives.
vegetables, fruit pulp.
cleaning agents, insecticides.
various glues, rust-remover, ketchup, seaweed, sap, algae.
is this luminol stuff ever useful?
I'm just asking because, it...
yes? It is?
fine. I'll shut up.
what?
luminol reacts with pond scum.
so?
right.
right.
pond Scum Scottie.
you're our guy.
you're under arrest.
knew it all along.
let's go. Come on, up.
Oh, God!
one person to your left, Dr. Collar.
my apologies, Agent Booth.
my echo-locator must have malfunctioned.
this may not be the most apropos time, but...
Oh, here we go.
here we go, what?
I was wondering...
could I have your phone number?
told you. Really?
I...have been considering how to respond if you asked, and have decided upon no.
I can go, right? - Yup.
cause I have some actual save-the-world work to do.
Dr. Collar.
you okay? - Yeah, I'm all right.
you know what? You're the only smart person I really like.
thank you.
Oh, that's...What-What about...What about me?
so, Diane Sidman agreed to publish Milton Alvaredo only if he shared credit with her.
right, so she said that he was using his theories about the God Particles...
particle. There's only one. I'm just saying.
right. Particle to vibrate the pond scum.
he gives her cancer, but she lives too long.
Yeah, then he, uh, kills her with a pencil and feeds her to crows so he doesn't have to share a credit.
wow, that is cold.
and creepy?
I didn't mean to call you creepy.
you said I have a creepy mode.
I apologize, okay?
look, I wasn't in my element.
well, every element is your element.
no, that is not true.
okay, listen.
we just got to stop hanging out with geniuses, because you're gonna figure out that I'm really stupid.
what? Don't worry about that.
I figured out a long time ago how stupid you are.
what I just said is true, and yet, it really sounded wrong.
what I should say is that I don't care how stupid you are.
it's not any better?
no. No. Not at all.
okay, well... - I mean, it's not even rel...
there is intelligence, which I have, and Mr. Nigel-Murray.
Oh, thank you.
and Sweets, even though his is so misdirected as to be meaningless. - right
backhand full of knuckles with that compliment.
and Hodgins.
and Angela...
not so much, but she's very talented.
thank you very much.
you're welcome.
but then there's another quality, which is the ability to use intelligence.
that is what you have.
Thanks, Bones.
Hey, wait a minute. Speaking of Hodgins, has anybody seen Hodgins?
no.
Oh, God.
overall, Clark is the most astute and experienced.
Ah, so, hire him.
Wendell has the most potential ent work ethic.
Plus, you know, he's somewhat normal.
well, that's what you like.
Vincent is the most intelligent.
well, that's whatyoulike, so you should hire him.
I mean, this person's gonna be your right hand man.
well, I've decided to take your opinion into account as I make this decision.
Really? - I'm making an effort.
well... Booth.
agent Booth, this is Sergeant Nakamura.
Nake, my friend Nake with the sake! How's it hanging?
I'm afraid they are not hanging well, Booth.
what's wrong?
my sister has not returned my calls. It has been five days.
okay, look, we all know how overly protective you are of Sachi. Your sister
you're a cop like me, Booth.
she calls every day. Something's wrong.
okay, so, why are you telling me?
cause I'm in Tokyo.
Oh, Sachi's here in D. C?
almost two months. She told me she called you. She has not called you?
just relax, all right?
21-year-old girl probably doesn't want her brother's friend cramping her style.
if I fly in, can you help me look for her?
I'll tell you what. Just text me her information,
I'll track her down and I'll make her call you. Okay? I promise.
detective Frame.
Hey, Rick, it's Booth. Listen, I'm looking for a little interagency cooperation.
what do you need?
Hey, has there been any action on a Japanese national, legal entry named Sachi Nakamura, female, age 21?
give me a minute.
when were you in Japan?
a few years ago on an exchange program with the Tokyo police.
Nak's a great guy, man.
he and his sister, you know, they made me feel like family.
but he's overprotective?
he worries. Every parent does.
but he's her brother.
raised his little sister after his parents died. That makes him a parent.
I got a hit on your girl.
a car registered to her was found abandoned near Tillbrook salt marshes.
salt marshes-- that's a pretty popular place to dump a body, Booth.
Yeah.
Hey, I'm Special Agent-- - Booth. Yeah.
detective Frame told me to wait on you before I had this vehicle towed.
well, that was nice of him. - I'm Officer Lisa Kopek.
car is registered to Sachi Nakamura, 311 Ring Road, here on a work visa from Tokyo, Japan.
I printed her visa photo.
this is blood on the upholstery. - Yeah.
any sign of the girl? - No.
damn. - Yeah.
checked her residence-- it's empty.
looks like it's been that way a couple days.
also no sign of her roommate, Nozomi Sato.
ms. Sato's here on a lapsed student visa.
I got a request in for cadaver dogs.
okay, whoa, whoa, Bones, what we usually do here is wait for people in rubber boots.
I see something...
I - I just got these shoes, so...
what is it, a body?
no, it's some kind of mask.
okay, Bones, come on, get out of there, let's go.
booth? - What?
there's flesh in the mask. Human head.
is she serious? - Yeah, always.
and Booth? This mask appears to be Japanese in design.
based on the weak prominence of thearcus superciliaris, the victim is female.
the head was decapitated between C5 and C6 vertebrae.
judging from decomp and discoloration,I'd estimate the head was in the pond a minimum of four days.
can you confirm decapitation as cause of death?
Nope, victim was in the water too long. The blood leached out.
there's trace lodged deep in the striae.
the blade could have transferred particulates from the ground into the wound track when it was withdrawn from the bone.
Hey, sweetie, Booth is in your office. He's got some people with him.
Thanks.
just when I thought it couldn't get worse.
bones, this here is Sachi Nakamura's brother Ken.
the honor is mine, Dr. Brennan.
may I present to you...
I know. Dr. Haru Tanaka.
the Emperor awarded Dr. Tanaka the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun for Dr. Tanaka's paper on "Investigation of Second,Fourth "and Eighth Sternal Rib End Variations related to Age Estimation.
it was brilliant.
I am honored to meet you.
everyone in the field accepts that you are the best.
Yes, I know.
I told Ken and the doctor they can aid in the investigation.
that is against protocol, Booth.
bones, this could be his sister.
I would enjoy working with Dr. Tanaka.
you gonna be okay with this? - I am fine.
there is a contact wound inferior to the mandible, exiting slightly anterior to the Bregma point.
that would be consistent with a gunshot wound.
bones, maybe you should just jump ahead and I. D.the victim.
maxilla and zygomatic conform to her photograph.
the palate is fractured but appears parabolic with a straight suture across the palatine bone indicating that she was a native Japanese speaker.
did your sister have any kind of distinctive facial scarring or dental work?
when Sachi was eight, she fell doing gymnastics; broke her jaw.
it was wired for two months.
impact fracture from a fall.
remodeling of the jaw suggests that it occurred prior to puberty.
I feel comfortable identifying the remains as your sister.
I'm very sorry. - Thank you.
if you would excuse me.
Hey, Nak, listen, I have agents looking for Sachi's roommate.
there's a chance the roommate may have seen something.
Yes. Good.
I'm sorry, Nak.
you have a child.
you know it was my responsibility to keep her safe.
she was 21 but still a child.
all right, come on, let me get you back to the hotel. You get some rest.
not until we find who did this.
I hear you, Nak. But we need a lead, something we can go on.
Sachi was going to move back to Japan.
but the man who took these pictures said he could make her a model.
okay, there's something. Right?
whoa, this is like one of those big-eyed paintings they sell at the mall.
uh, the mask is based on anime design. - Japanese animation.
so, someone had it out for a cartoon character?
no, this is original, uh, not representing any of the well-known characters:
sailor Moon, Faye Valentine, Motoko.
the mask could have been used by the killer to dehumanize the victim, allowing whoever decapitated her to distance himself from the ugly reality of her death.
hmm, you are entering the realm of psychology, a field of unverifiable speculation.
perhaps I can be of further help to Dr. Brennan.
sometimes I hate hard science.
I know that seems immature, but that's just how I feel.
so, any guesses? - We don't really have enough evidence yet.
no, not the case. The doctor.
dude or dudette?
I don't know. - I...
now, rember, Nak, this is my investigation. You're just a tourist.
just a tourist.
Micah Strutt. How can I help you?
FBI. I'd like to ask you a few questions about Sachi Nakamura and Nozomi Sato.
sure. They were the roommates, right? Nice kids.
when did you see them last?
must be about a couple months now. They came in for a shoot.Pappa Puffs.
Yeah, the girls worked there. - You made them pose like this?
me? No. That was their idea.
they convinced their boss to do some advertising, but he went postal when he saw the proofs.
that old jerk fired them for this.
the 21st century, who cares about a little skin, right?
he does. That's his sister.
Hey, I feel like someone slipped something into my coffee, huh?
fashion is the way the Japanese youth rebel against traditional social roles.
what is with the, uh,"amaloli" girls?
I never expected to see the, uh, "Sweet Lolitas" here in the States.
the culture follows the youth. It's just innocent role playing. Usually.
Nak...
I see.
excuse me. You the owner? - Why do you ask?
we need your help. As a tourist.
we'd like to ask you a few questions about Sachi Nakamura and her friend Nozomi.
are Sachi and Nozomi in trouble?
uh, Sachi is dead and Nozomi is missing.
I've known them since they started coming for the tea parties.
they were anime girls. I gave them jobs.
is this the, uh, mask that, uh, Sachi was wearing to the parties?
no, that's Nozomi's. What happened?
those girls were like family.
you always fire family?
they developed other interests.
they didn't belong here anymore.
I tried to talk to them, explain what a bad choice they were making.
what are you talking about?
the girls started working for an escort service.
I couldn't allow that here. Families come here
that's not possible!
it's true. - Not my sister.
your sister...? - You know the name of the escort service?
elegant Escorts. - Don't believe you!
Yeah, put the cleaver down, pal.
easy.
put it down.
Dr. Saroyan. - Dr. Tanaka.
with your permission, I would like to free the head of tissue.
I have a test to perform first.
you're welcome to observe.
this is ferrozine? - Yes. I'm testing for gunshot residue.
no reaction.
any shot fired within five feet would've left residue.
the angle of entry was steep, exiting at the top of the cranium.
Sachi was only five feet tall.
even if her killer was lying on the ground, there'd be residue.
perhaps she was coming downstairs.
or maybe standing on the balcony of her apartment?
grab some goggles and a mask.
did you know the victim, Dr. Tanaka?
I met Sachi three times. She and her brother were very close.
that's a very big favor to do Detective Nakamura, coming all the way from Japan.
I would do anything for him.
okay.
there.
while I examine the wound track, you can analyze exit trauma.
thank you.
since Booth took you out of the field,I thought perhaps you'd like to consolidate the results of our analysis to convey to Booth.
you are trying to make me feel useful.
no, I... I don't really do things like that.
I owe you for talking Booth out of sending me home.
wasn't me. Booth is a very empathetic man.
Yes. Are you aware how we met?
some kind of exchange program?
Aye.
most of the FBI agents showed up and started telling us how to handle our organized crime problem.
booth said nothing. Two, three days, just listening.
he was quiet? That...
that does not sound like Booth.
then he asked a question.
he asked, "How would you gentlemen handle our organized crime problem?
he was respectful.
that is the basis of your friendship?
that and a situation incited by a gallon of sake, a police boat, and Uraga Harbor at dawn.
you're a lucky woman, Dr. Brennan.
to work with Booth? I know.
to work with Booth. Yes.
there you go.
so, the mask didn't belong to the killer, it belonged to Nozomi, Sachi's roommate.
okay, so?
so perhaps the killer wasn't trying to dehumanize his victim.
two coffees, please? - You got it.
well, maybe he just had a thing for girls in masks.
I mean, I get that. - You do?
Yeah.
in an objective, evidentiary way.
you had a point?
Yeah, I think that the killer was purposely projecting Nozomi's identity onto his murder victim.
so, I Googled Tanaka.
300 hits, all Japanese, none with a personal pronoun.
maybe we should just ask her. - Him.
uh, you people can identify human remains based on a tiny little finger bone, but you can't judge the sex of a person standing right in front of you?
does nobody else see the irony in this?
of course.
but, as a scientist, I also see the challenge.
well, Dr. Tanaka identifies with a subset of an urban Japanese aesthetic known askei.
thank you. It glorifies androgyny.
well, mission accomplished there, Dr. Tanaka.
you know, I think you're probably right. We should just ask him. - Her.
Tanaka won't answer. That's the whole point. Gender is unimportant.
we should be mature enough to accept Dr. Tanaka just the way Dr. Tanaka is.
Yeah, you know what? You're right. Who cares?
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't really matter what he is. - She.
what she is.
do you mind? - Yeah, actually I do.
James Sok, right? Elegant Escorts?
Yeah. So? I run a legitimate business.
you're a pimp. I don't like pimps.
he really doesn't. - No.
your record says that you assaulted Bruce Takedo.
those charges were dropped.
because the guy attacked me with a knife.
all I did was protect myself. - Really. Probably because you were recruiting at his place.
middle-aged guy, surrounds himself with schoolgirls, maybe he's the guy you want to look at.
Nozomi Sato. You recognize her?
Yeah. I like Nozomi.
she's missing.
well, most of my models come from Asia. They're young, flaky.
sometimes they take off.
you know, you got a sweet life, Jimmy.
you got a houseboat down at the marina. You got cash rolling in.
if you want to live your life as my prime suspect in the murder of Sachi Nakamura, that's just fine.
but just know, as of right now, your business is done.
or? - Or you give me something shiny to distract me.
I don't know anything about Sachi Nakamura.
but, uh, Nozomi booked a client last Friday, and I haven't seen her since.
that's the day that Sachi Nakamura disappeared.
what's the client's name? - Banker named Vogler.
got hurt bad in the Big Crunch. Made him mean.
and Nozomi didn't mind a little rough stuff.
let's go, Bones.
that shiny enough for you? - Excuse me?
booth... Okay, come on.
there is a small scratch to the left of the exit wound.
and the directionality is outward from the midpoint of the coronal suture.
whatever pierced the skull must have splintered back inside.
Splintered? It was a gunshot. Don't you mean fragmented?
there are no striations on the cross section of the exit wound.
so, she wasn't killed by a bullet?
that is my assessment.
what could have been driven through her head?
perhaps you can inform Booth that the murder weapon was not a gun.
and we can X-ray the brain to see if we find any evidence of splinters.
I ran the particulates from the C-5 through the mass spec.
nematodes, Turbellaria, Copepods, blah-blah-blah
all congruent with the marsh where the head was found.
I am not familiar with the blah-blah-blah.
but I also found bird vomit on the victim's head.
now I truly do not understand.
totally lost. - Okay, uh, all right.
in salt marshes, there are high marshes, low marshes and salt flats.
Dr. Brennan found the head on the low marsh.
Yes, but the bird vomit comes fromCatoptrophorus semipalmatus.
a willet.
the The willet is a high marsh creature.
but the cadaver dogs are looking here on the low marsh.
they should be looking here in the high marsh, where the willet is found.
but that is miles away.
Yeah, which is why we need to call the search team.
why would someone cut a head off a bodhere and drive miles away to dispose of the head here?
I rarely find motive in bird vomit.
seek!
it's you. - Okay.
Nak... I think we found her.
I will autopsy the remains, then give the body back to Dr. Brennan, so she can remove the tissue.
the marks on the vertebrae will give us a clearer idea of the weapon used to decapitate her.
Dr. Tanaka can help me prepare the brain for liquefaction.
perhaps he shouldn't be here.
if he doesn't ask for help, it would be an insult for me to offer.
it would imply weakness.
I realize that staying here shows great strength and commitment to your sister's memory.
she is lucky to have such a devoted brother.
but it is distracting for us and might compromise our work.
I'm sure you wouldn't want that.
of course not.
I will come to you with any news.
the heat and vibration will liquefy the tissue enabling us to examine whatever foreign particle was picked up by the X-ray.
this was an excellent idea.
thank you.
is there something wrong?
what? No. Why?
you were staring at me.
I was? I was? I don't-- I didn't realize. I like your shirt.
Oh, wow, look at that brain.
Oh, I think I see it.
what is it? - Wood?
the wound track wasn't from a bullet, but from a piece of wood being thrust into her skull?
let's not get ahead of ourselves-- give it to Hodgins so we know exactly what we're dealing with.
right away. He has also been staring.
it seems many people like my shirt.
what the hell?
don't stop because of us.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about Nozomi Sato.
how much do you charge for a massage?
two hundred dollars. - Bones.
what? That seems way too much.
her knowledge of skeletal and musculature systems seems minimal at best.
right. Uh, she's not that type of masseuse. So, Nozomi Sato?
who? - You know, the prostitute you like beating up.
I don't know what you're talking about.
okay, fine. We'll just go subpoena the phone records from Elegant Escorts.
I saw her a few times.
Yeah, to blow off some steam. You know... - Oh, really.
a photographer who did some ads for my firm
he's the one that gave me the Elegant flyer.
Micah Strutt? - Yeah.
I guess he shot for them, too.
you should really focus on the iliocostalis and the longissimus.
that's where most people carry their tension. Like this.
whoa, that's great. - You see?
that's what they want. - Not usually.
bones, she's a "happy ending" masseuse. Okay,"happy ending.
what about this girl?
I never met her.
Nozomi was the only escort I was seeing.
you seem to be a fine collector of Asian art.
do you want to explain the sword on the wall there, in the background?
it's a Nihonto sword.
it was used by the feudal executioners to behead the condemned.
Yeah, I know. I had to sell it. I lost a fortune in the market.
how convenient of you to sell the sword off, you know.
Sachi Nakamura was beheaded.
what? - Beheaded.
Hey, I don't know what you're thinking...
hitting the iliohypogastric nerve can be extremely painful.
Where's the sword now?
listen...
I'm not saying another word to you people without my lawyer.
fine. That's fine with us. We'll be in touch. Come on, Bones.
Oh, she's a quick learner. - Yeah. Very quick.
Hey, I did a little research on Strutt Photography.
I almost asked Tanaka.
no. Really?
not that it matters. But he-- she/he caught me staring.
I didn't mean to, but I had an opening, you know, but I didn't know how to lead off.
if I said he/she was a girl and he/she was a guy, he/she might be offended, or other way around, same thing.
God, I miss the ease of a simple pronoun.
Yeah, tell me about it.
all right, check out Strutt Photography's Web site.
now, there's a link to additional services which requires permission and a password.
I traced the IP address and I found the ftp site that contains all the uploads.
then I bypassed the password protection by hacking into the server where his Web address is registered.
why do I feel like my checking account isn't safe?
look what Mr. Strutt's been hiding.
these pictures definitely weren't taken at Strutt's studio.
long lens, foreground objects, probably taken without the subject's consent.
classic stalker photos.
if he was stalking Sachi...
maybe it wasn't just pictures he wanted to shoot.
forgive me, Dr. Brennan, but I must ask if you are familiar with the Shinto idea ofkami?
the spiritual essence of an object? - Yes.
I cannot define what is missing from this skull, how itskamiis incomplete.
maybe because the top of the cranium had been removed.
perhaps.
I often find that handling the bone ges me insight that pure science cannot explain.
well, I find that pure science is the only thing that gives satisfactory explanations, Dr. Tanaka.
there is something with the temporal bone.
Yes. The tympanomastoid. A swelling in the air space.
Tympanomastoid hemorrhaging in the absence of a bleeding diathesis.
the victim was drowned.
very impressive, Dr. Tanaka.
it wasn't me. It was thekami.
well, she wasn't killed by whatever pierced her brain. I aspirated her lungs.
cause of death was drowning.
we need to determine if the victim was drowned in the marsh or somewhere else.
no problem. I'll analyze the water samples from the lungs.
now, I discovered what the splinter from the brain tissue is.
It'spseudosa japonica. It's arrow bamboo. It's ornamental.
only grows indoors in this climate.
sharpened bamboo could easily pierce the skull.
the girl was drowned first, a mask was put on her, then she was decapitated and her head was mounted on a bamboo stake?
Yeah, then the head was tossed into the marsh?
let's find out what kind of water was in her lungs.
she was beautiful, wasn't she?
Yes, she was.
a beautiful young woman.
which is probably why she came to America.
she felt like a woman and wanted to be rid of a big brother watching her all the time.
my parents left me and my brother when I was 15.
my brother was the only family that I had then.
but he walked out on me, too.
I'm sorry.
I turned out quite well, actually.
but it would've been nice to have had a brother like you.
according to the FBI logs, she called you everyday.
often twice a day. And the conversations never were less than five minutes and averaged 15 minutes.
this has meaning for you?
objectively speaking, it would indicate an irrefutable desire to connect.
a deep and abiding love.
I cannot imagine never talking to her again.
I myself have no one in my life whom I talk to that much.
outside of work, I mean.
perhaps that is good.
how so?
I can see how much pain you're in.
is it worth it...
to have your own happiness so contingent upon another human being?
if I was willing to give up my life for Sachi...
why would I not be willing to risk my happiness for her?
Hodgins analyzed the water in Sachi's lungs.
I found dibromides.
it's the active ingredient in algaecides used to treat water features.
so the victim wasn't drowned in the salt marshes.
she was drowned in a water feature?
Hey, the photographer has a water thing in his lobby.
feature. Water feature.
I'm not going to say "feature." It's just weird, okay?
I'll say pond or pool. - Or thing.
all right, wishing well. Can we just move on?
Hodgins, if we had a sample, could you isolate a single water feature?
Yeah, I could match profiles.
if you think the photographer is the killer, I want to be there.
Nak, if you budge from the Jeffersonian, I will have you on the first plane back to Japan.
you understand? You know me. And you know that's true.
you were kind of mean there, Booth.
the man's in big pain, Bones.
makes it hard for him to hear.
I've never heard of grief affecting auditory acuteness.
medical fact. Look it up.
I thought you only did one shoot with Sachi Nakamura, huh?
okay, look, this is-- it's getting totally out of hand.
maybe I should get a lawyer.
what's your connection with James Sok?
all I do is give him names, man. - What names?
names of girls who don't mind doing nude shots.
Oh, a finder's fee?
Yeah. - Yeah.
but, I mean, that's all.
right. I mean, you do know what James Sok does with these girls, right?
I mind my own business. - He's a pimp. Which makes you a pimp, too.
what about Sachi? - She wouldn't pose nude.
what about these photos? - What? It's a style, man.
look, I got the releases that she signed before we even did it. You want to see 'em?
Yes. Thank you.
the water at the photographer's studio uses chlorine.
so Sachi was not drowned there?
no, sir. You should inform Dr. Saroyan.
Yeah, I already have; I just thought if I were you,I'd want to hear everything from the horse's mouth.
thank you, Dr. Hodgins.
any luck with the microsil?
Yes. I believe your partly Chinese woman will be able to reconstruct the tool used to decapitate the victim.
excuse me? I heard that.
Dr. Tanaka means no offense.
in Japanese, that would not sound so insulting.
I will complete my work and give you the results.
so, how are you holding up?
I should have known the life she was living.
listen, your sister wasn't a prostitute.
her roommate was.
it was a warning.
what was?
putting Sachi's head on the spike.
in feudal Japan, a traitor's head was placed on a pole as a warning that others should fear the warlords.
right. And she was wearing her roommate Nozomi's mask.
Yes. Because the warning was meant for Nozomi.
Nozomi sees the head and knows she must run.
and she disposes of it so that no one will think that she killed Sachi.
but what did my sister do?
if Sachi was a good girl...
what did she do to get killed?
picked up her roommate trying to leave the country.
she's still pretty freaked out.
she saw her best friend's head on a spike.
trauma like that could take years to assimilate.
Yeah, we don't have years, okay? So get in there and work your magic. All right?
go.
we'll keep you safe, Nozomi.
you don't have to worry.
can I get you anything?
look... I know you feel alone.
you think that no one else could understand what you went through.
and no one could.
but that doesn't mean that you can't be helped.
we can preventanything like this from happening again, to you or anyone else.
if you tell us who did this, Nozomi, we can protect you.
and we'll make sure that you get home safely.
we got the general shape from Dr. Tanaka's cast, but we still need to fill in the details.
does the basic shape resemble akatanasword or a Japanese dough knife?
well, it's too early to say.
the prominent residual striae indicate that a power tool was not used and that the blade was curved.
it has a combination of serrated and plain edging.
all right, so there goes thekatanasword.
from the breakaway spur,I could see that there are approximately six teeth per inch on the serrated section.
okay, anything else?
there also appears to be something that catches on the bone as it's pulled back, like a hook near the blade's point.
Ooh, that's good.
I've never seen a knife like that.
perhaps there was an error in the topography of my mold.
no, I've seen this knife before. It's a marine knife.
the hook is used for cutting line and cord.
wait a minute-- James Sok, the owner of Elegant Escorts, doesn't he live on a boat?
so what was it, Sok? You wanted to keep, uh, Nozomi in line, so you used Sachi as an example?
Sachi-- she doesn't even work for you.
where did you get that?
we have a search warrant. These were taken from your boat.
the serrations are consistent with the tool markings on the bone.
I didn't kill anyone.
then you're going to have to explain why there's blood on your knife.
it's clean.
what? - There's no blood on the knife.
Yeah, well, I'm sure there's another knife.
we'll just tear your place apart until we find one, that's all.
booth? He didn't clean the sheath.
look at that. Why don't you just save the taxpayers some money and confess?
why don't you offer me a deal instead?
you're really in no bargaining position right now, Mr. Sok.
evidence proves that you killed Sachi.
no, it doesn't. It proves that he cut off her head. She died by drowning.
very good.
Sachi stuck her nose in where it didn't belong.
if you want to know who killed her, you'll cut me a deal.
right. You cut off her head and you stuck it on a spike to keep your girls in line, andyouwant me to cut you a deal?
Yeah, that's right.
what do you want to do, Nak? - I want to kill him.
look, he could give us Sachi's murder.
and then he goes free?
the man who put my sister's head on a spike?
if we don't cut this deal, then her murder could walk.
it's your case, Booth.
what I want doesn't matter.
to me, it does. And it would to Sachi.
cut the deal.
he was a good customer, one of my best.
always wanted Nozomi. But he liked to get rough.
sometimes maybe too rough.
one day that girl, Sachi, barges into Vogler's place, screaming, saying she was going to call her cop brother if Vogler ever touched her friend Nozomi again.
Vogler pushes her into his koi pond, holds her down just to shut her up.
idiot kills her.
he paid me to clean up the mess.
so, yeah, I put the girl's head in Nozomi's apartment.
and Nozomi took off, like I knew she would.
I had a business to save.
but I didn't kill anyone. It was Vogler.
Hey, Nak.
Nozomi has been cleared to leave by immigration.
I will see that she gets home safely.
thank you, Nak.
and Sachi can rest with our parents.
if the teachings are correct, she will be reborn.
and Sok and Vogler will have to answer for their actions.
that is highly improbable.
but I hope that it's true.
I am forever in your debt.
my friend, one of those good Japanese beers will be just fine.
Oh, I prefer sake.
sake.
we'll let you know when it's time to go, okay?
so... no one asked Tanaka?
it doesn't matter, remember?
Yeah, yeah, no, I know.
it's Tanaka's life. We are not children.
very good.
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Hey, Haru. It was great working with you.
I hope
okay
it
Yeah.
which
I know.
yum. Here you go.
people
I just
we
I - Even
don't even
every
so - We - Right.
okay. You're right.
tomorrow night, our noble conference champions, the Middlesex Archers...
face the desperate and conniving Forest Lake Otters.
right about now, the Otters must be wondering where their mascot went.
lake Forest sucks!
lake Forest sucks!
lake Forest sucks!
archers, raise your bows.
archers, aim.
archers, fire!
ladies and gentlemen of Middlesex College, aim your weapons!
fire at will!
artillery!
fire!
fire!
what is that thing? 'Cause it looks real.
Oh, my gosh, what is that thing?
male. Some of this costume has fused to the remains.
uh, good morning. I'm Vernon Warner, dean of students.
special Agent Seeley Booth. This here is Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian.
there is a lot of damage to this body.
they had a cannon.
more like a blunderbuss, really.
filled to the brim with bric-a-brac and shrapnel.
Yeah, look, I suspect that this might be a prank. - A prank?
well, it's a college, Bones.
I suspect that one of our less reflective frat houses may have stolen these remains from the, uh, medical school.
beta Delta Sigma.
I got a missing cadaver report yesterday.
tell you what, Bones, when I was in college, my frat, we stole a cadaver, dressed it up like Caesar and put it on a statue of a horse.
would this by any chance be a fraternity of sociopaths?
but if the Betas did do this, I will withdraw their certification.
stolen cadaver was male, 73 years old.
his snowmobile fell through the ice.
donated his body to science.
Yeah, snowmobilers and motorcyclists are our main source of cadavers.
no.
the third molar has not fully erupted.
I'd be surprised if he was older than mid-20s.
so this is not the missing cadaver?
I think you'll find your missing medical school cadaver is over there. Where?
sitting on the bleachers.
he hasn't moved since we got here.
no, that's just campus security.
they're always like that. But I'll go check it out.
so if he is not a stolen cadaver, then, uh...
he wasn't alive when our students shot him with the cannon, was he?
I won't know cause of death until I get him back to the lab.
Yeah, she's right. It's your cadaver.
he reeks of formaldehyde.
okay. Let's get it all back to the Jeffersonian, shall we?
looks like someone took a flamethrower to Sasquatch.
well, this is what he was supposed to look like.
someone finally killed a mascot?
Mr. Vaziri, do you have the X-rays?
Yes.
I have never seen so many foreign objects in human remains.
arrows, marbles, jacks, various coins, cutlery.
my best guess is a nuclear explosion occurred just as the victim entered a 99 cent store.
well, uh, close. He was shot by a blunderbuss, pelted by an angry mob and then burned.
now that's what I call team spirit.
I'm a wisecracking pathologist with a dark sense of humor.
it was funny.
Yeah.
what did they say?
dishonorable discharge?
court-martial convicted me of misuse of authority and theft of government property.
come on, no Booth has ever gotten a dishonorable discharge.
uh, yeah, no Booth has ever had to save his brother from an insane kidnapper.
I'm sorry.
I owed you for digging me out of crap my whole life.
you're gonna need a job.
I joined the navy when I was 17.
so a job, that's what civilians refer to as "duty," right?
angela identified the boy in the otter suit. - Well, that was quick.
just give me a second. - Are you talking to me?
no, I'm talking to my brother.
just give me one minute.
just do your thing. I'll catch up with you later.
look, hey, I'll help you find a job.
what, me?
I save your life, you find me a job.
Yeah, seems fair.
Yeah. I'm back.
the student walk-in dentist was able to provide dental records.
I e-mailed you the particulars.
the victim is James Bouvier.
his friends called him "Beaver," I assume because of his last name, which is Bouvier.
Yeah, I'm sure that's why.
although, despite the similar sound,"bouvier" means ox, not beaver.
beaver is 23 years old and a member of the Beta Delta Sigma fraternity.
Yeah, that's not a coincidence.
statistically, given the size of the campus, it could be a complete coincidence that the murdered student is also a member of the group of sociopathic young male cadaver thieves.
statistically, maybe. But this is not math class, okay, Bones?
just meet me at Middlesex College in 30 minutes.
don't mention anything about Beaver when we're talking to these people. - What people?
these people here. They're all potential suspects.
got it? - Okay.
okay, so who organized the rally last night?
that would be me and Gary.
that's, uh, Greg Harmalard and Gary Bacon.
the bonfire is kind of a tradition.
uh, I and Gary added the whole hanging the enemy mascot element.
uh, Molly brought in the band and took care of letting everyone know the where and when details.
um, well, just an e-mail chain, really.
well, whose idea was the blunderbuss?
me again.
you have to understand that we had no idea there was a cadaver in there.
it's from the med school, right? That's what I heard.
okay, who stole the otter costume from Forest Lake?
um, me, Greg and Dave.
when you stole the costume, was there anything inside of it?
nothing. I mean, there was the dancing acrobat dude, whatever, but we duct-taped him to a pole and took the suit.
okay, where was the costume located between the time you stole it and it was hung on the gallows, blown up and incinerated?
well, we just kicked it under there.
it's a homecoming float.
me, Dave and Greg stuffed it with cafeteria leftovers in plastic bags.
the head was a cantaloupe.
uh, next day, we brought in Dave's dad's truck and hung it up, drove it out to the rally.
so are any of you guys members of the Beta Delta Sigma fraternity?
um, the Betas don't build school spirit-- they tear it down.
so definitely not.
any of you guys know a guy by the name of Jimmy Bouvier?
also known as Beaver.
um, he's a Beta.
he's got a huge bong.
beaver's okay. You know, he's a good time guy.
he likes to throw up a lot is all I know.
but if anybody was gonna put a cadaver in an otter costume, it-it'd be Beaver.
I'll bet he was watching everyone running and screaming last night and laughing his ass off.
this is a commemorative pin from the Chinese Olympics.
it was in what's left of the victim's liver.
ball bearing. All this stuff is extremely common.
nails, screws, bolts, washers, keys...
what is this?
my guess, it's a USB drive.
what kind of people do this?
perforate human remains with household commonalities and refuse.
gee, I don't know. Every bomber who ever lived.
did you make that comment simply because I am Muslim?
you serious? Of course.
timothy McVeigh, Ted Kaczynski, William Ayres, Mr. George P. Metesky,
known as the original Mad Bomber.
seems an insurmountable task, this.
each of these could have been the cause of death, and yet we will not be able to trace its...
trace its...
what?
origin.
a bullet says "I wish to kill you" much more clearly than an Olympic pin.
can we agree? - Yeah.
I'm Robert Hooper, the Beta Delta chapter president.
this is Dalton Abbot; he helped the Beaver steal the corpse from the med school.
all right, listen, guys, we don't care about the cadaver.
we just want to find out who killed your brother.
we agreed before you guys got here that we'd answer any and all questions you have, truthfully.
a conspiracy to tell the truth.
interesting.
Yeah, Eli was the Beaver's frosh.
you know, kind of breaking him into the Greek life.
what was Beaver like?
he was the most popular guy in the house.
no, I asked, "What was he like?" Not,"Was he liked?
sweets. - What? There's a difference.
look, the Beaver was exactly like a great guy who everybody liked.
he was cool, yeah. Yeah, everybody liked him. He was a brother.
what was Beaver's life like outside of the fraternity?
like Eli said, everybody liked him.
well, except for the faculty. He was on academic probation.
but academic probation is the price you pay for everybody liking you.
girlfriend?
or is this one of those bros before hos kind of frats?
beaver was more like a partier.
Why? What makes you think so?
scoreboard. - What?
beaver, one star, one conquest.
so do the stars here represent the number of times individual members of the fraternity completed the sex act or the number of girls?
the second.
just curious-- do you also compare penis sizes?
only if we're really drunk and already naked. What?
what? I...
we agreed to answer all their questions truthfully.
very successful, according to this.
compensating for something.
sweets, stop psychoanalyzing frat life, and just get on with the Beaver questions.
sure, of course.
but, guys, wouldn't it be more impressive to actually have a single girl want to have sex with you multiple times?
unless your only objective is to impress other adolescent males.
guys, Beaver's single star?
thank you.
guys, we agreed, for the last time.
if Harmalard found out that Beaver was bouncing Molly, he'd kill him.
the-the guy who organized the bonfire?
Yeah. Yeah, Molly's boyfriend.
he's in ROTC.
they like shooting things.
Yeah.
they keep track of sexual conquests with stars on the wall?
it's emotionally stunted.
guys, it's a college fraternity.
they seem like really terrible people.
they're college kids, okay?
their job description is to be bad. It's what they do.
Yeah, but still. A community of young men mutually supporting bad decisions?
look, these kids, they go out into the world, they're alone. They have no supervision.
they have to be bad in order to figure out what it is.
scientific fact, their frontal lobes are the size of raisins.
no, that is not a scientific fact.
what they got to do is build their frontal lobes with exercise, okay?
and that comes from doing the wrong thing.
okay. So, you're theory is, you got to be bad to be good?
exactly. Facts of life, my friend.
okay, so what transmissions did you get from the brothers?
booth, he is not a radio.
well, he kind of is. That's why I brought him along, Bones.
what I did observe, using my eyes and my trading, is that these three frat brothers weren't actually upset about Beaver's death.
how do you know?
well, real grief comes and goes in waves.
these guys had their faces set in sadness the whole time.
they were lying.
I believe you're just guessing.
okay... Fine.
I'm a Magic 8 Ball.
I think you hurt his feelings.
but... Did you believe him?
the bullet Arastoo found in the victim's remains was a. 22 caliber.
light and relatively undamaged.
low-pressure rimfire cartridge.
which is consistent with ROTC small arms.
so, you recognize this pistol?
Yes, sir. It's a Beretta U22 Neos, LR with a six inch barrel, ten round capacity, low blade front sights and adjustable rear sights.
I'm in ROTC. I know my weapons.
well, you should know this one particularly well because it was last signed out to you.
FBI ballistics has ascertained that this gun fired this bullet.
where did you find the bullet?
in Beaver's corpse.
beaver's dead?
he's catching on pretty good.
wait, I never shot Beaver.
did you fire this gun at the rally?
Yes, sir, I did, but I loaded it with blanks.
that was Beaver hanging in the Otter mascot outfit?
he's quite adept at putting the puzzle together.
what was Beaver doing in there?
well, we were hoping that maybe you would be able to tell us.
look, I told you. I loaded the gun with blanks.
did you check the chamber?
I think so.
well, obviously, you are either careless or you intended to fire the bullet.
or somebody, you know, sabotaged me.
beaver had to be hanging up there for at least an hour before...
no way that Beaver was still alive when I fired, right?
I had no idea it was Beaver. I had no reason to shoot Beaver.
except for the fact that he slept with your girlfriend.
uh, I don't...I don't want to sound conceited, but look at Beaver. Look at Molly. Look at me.
me and Beaver?
sexually?
do I look like a blow-up doll?
beaver told his fraternal brothers that he had sex with you.
yeah? Well, he lied.
look, I'll give you DNA or whatever you want.
and then you can do me a favor and broadcast the results across the campus.
Thanks.
we don't have anything to compare her DNA to.
I have an idea.
we're going to collect his sheets off his bed?
Yes. And then we will check them for DNA, see if he had sexual intercourse with Molly Briggs.
right.
who's going to check the kid's sheets? Seems like a bad job to me.
gentlemen, raise your glasses.
members of Beta Delta Sigma,
I ask that you form in your mind your favorite image of our fallen brother,
why are they all wearing bedsheets?
it's a toga memorial.
and with that image firm in your mind, Mm-hmm. I say, drink!
excuse me?
did one of you take the sheets from Beaver's room?
because that room is sealed for evidence and you will be prosecuted.
good one, Bones. Now no one's going to admit to having Beaver's sheets.
well, then, we'll have to take them all.
uh, you can take mine, pretty lady.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, you heard them, boys.
give them your sheets.
I'll meet you back at the lab, okay?
can I offer you anything, ma'am?
no.
what do you think?
Yeah, it's nice. Not really going to do you much good here in the wintertime. That's for sure.
you're always practical, huh, Seeley?
listen, I got you a job interview. - Yeah?
Yeah. An army buddy of mine up in Pittsburgh is looking for someone to head up his criminal intelligence unit.
you found me a job in less than 24 hours?
just an interview.
you want to use my car? - No.
Jared, you can't show up to a job interview on a bike.
Seeley, I'm not going to the interview. - Why?
because I don't want a job.
I'm going to take this thing and I'm going on a trip.
Oh, you're going on a trip? Where?
I've always wanted to see India.
without, you know, spying on Pakistan.
okay, I see. So you're going to somehow get this bike to India, ride it around?
what if it breaks down? What are you going to do for parts?
what am I going to do for parts if it breaks down in India?
that's all you have to say?
you know what? Just go on the interview.
would you...
you forgot to tell me to get shots and not to talk to strangers.
so, were you able to match sheets with boys?
believe me, there was enough DNA on these sheets to paint a very clear picture of life at Beta Delta Sigma.
for example, these two boys were carrying on a sexual relationship with each other.
Yeah, those two guys are sleeping with the same girl.
although, refreshingly, not at the same time.
what about Beaver?
Oh, lots and lots of DNA.
all of it his own.
so, there was no DNA on any of the sheets that could be Molly Briggs'?
vaginal contributions were found on eight of the sets of sheets.
none from Molly Briggs.
but Dr. Hodgins did find something more than semen on Beaver's sheets.
Yeah, I found evidence of vegetable-based Lanol, assorted liposomes, Sepigeland micronized estriol.
ointment.
from the stain's position on the sheet and its shape, which was approximately three inches long by one and one-quarter inch wide...
okay, we get it.
the substance appears to have transferred from the victim'spenis directly to the bedsheet.
adolescent males will use almost any available lubricant when masturbating.
even estrogen cream?
a more plausible scenario has got Beaver sexing it up at a different location then coming home to his own bed naked and, I refer again to the imprint.
sex with...
an older woman. Yeah. Yeah, most likely menopausal.
Molly Briggs is 20.
also, I finished my autopsy and the bullet shot by Greg Harmalard was definitely not cause of death.
he was dead when it struck him?
for at least 12 hours.
so, we still have no cause of death.
well, I got a theory.
kid died of dehydration.
forgot to replenish his fluids.
okay, what are we looking for this time?
you know, photos, love notes...Uh, I don't know.
fur, gray hair... Anything that's going to help us identify Beaver's cougar.
beaver, otter, cougar...This case is like a day at the zoo.
a cougar is an older woman who prefers younger men.
wouldn't that indicate that every woman is a cougar?
thanks for the insight there, Bones.
okay, what's the, uh, victim's birth date?
I'm Jared's older brother, you know. He should listen to me.
I could provide you with several societies where younger brothers are required under threat of death to do what their older brothers tell them.
I like those societies.
well, they're mostly extinct now.
did you give me Beaver's birth date the scientific way?
day, month, year. If you want month, day, year... 05-11-89.
look at that. Next time I ask you a question, just answer it in American. That's all.
kid had some cash.
maybe he was a drug dealer.
Ooh, what are those? Some kind of code books?
you got that right.
was our victim some kind of spy?
it's worse.
he was some kind of bookie.
well, Booth mostly broke the code. - That's right.
column one is initials and nicknames.
beaver had approximately 50 regular clients.
column two is the day of the week.
what is the significance of this sequence?
foot, bat, pig, dimple, fish.
those are sports he took bets on.
beaver had over $2, 000 in the suitcase.
this whole operation generated $12, 000 this year.
no wonder this kid did not want to lose academic standing.
all right, now, three of these people-- Zimmer, CC, and 4x4 -
they all owed him over three grand apiece.
do you think that could be motive?
I bet those are the three guys Sweets said were faking grief.
Yeah, that is worth looking into.
okay, I found something else in his computer.
a month ago, he hacked into the university's computer system, and went straight to the chemistry professor's secure server and downloaded the exam.
this guy was a true entrepreneur. - Yeah.
it was the third time he hacked into the chemistry page.
who was the professor?
uh... Professor Marlene Twardosh.
out of all the damages the victim's remains suffered from the blunderbuss-- 23 fractures -
I discovered only three that occurred before he died.
do any of them offer us cause of death?
I think not.
both wrists sustained compression fractures.
the right radius, the left ulna and significant chipping to both the proximal and distal carpal rows, and compression of the lateral epicondyles.
Ouch. What about the third?
compression fracture here, at the coccyx and the apex of the sacrum.
these injuries appear to have occurred at the same time.
he fell backwards, tried to break his fall with his hands stretched behind him.
Dr. Hodgins had an idea of how to figure out the height from which the victim fell.
Oh, this should be good.
the FBI is investigating student cheating?
who says America undervalues education?
did any of your students do suspiciously well on your last exam?
starting with James Bouvier.
beaver has never done suspiciously well at anything, Agent Booth.
he was about to be expelled because he failed my course.
did he show any signs that he wanted to do any better?
you mean, begging for mercy or offering bribes and sexual favors? That sort of thing?
do you use an estrogen cream?
no. I make do with the meager hormones I produce naturally. Why?
did you have sexual intercourse with Beaver?
I was joking about the sexual favors.
also about the bribes?
my God, you people are humorless.
five students failed this exam.
it was a tough exam.
they got exactly the same score: 37%.
what are the chances of that?
I teach chemistry.
you'll have to ask Professor DeWitt in Statistics.
the same five students did extremely well on the two tests preceding this one.
bones, what are you getting at?
I believe Professor Twardosh realized that these students had stolen her tests in the past, and instead of informing the university, she planted a fake test online.
to turn her students in?
no. That would result in hearings and excuses and tears and parents.
I hate parents.
look, your college experience was with professors. Mine was with students and jocks.
what are you getting at here?
I believe Professor Twardosh took revenge against unethical students who had no respect for knowledge.
and you approve?
Yes, I do.
beaver was obviously an emerging criminal.
thank you.
I may need you to testify at my termination hearing when the university finds out.
can I ask you one question?
what floor is your office on?
the third floor.
over grass?
over flagstones.
on my bad days, I consider jumping.
you're a forensic anthropologist, correct?
would it kill me?
no, Professor Twardosh.
it would probably just break a few bones.
that's good to know.
so, I checked out the nicknames of the kids who owed Beaver money.
are those the guys you picked out as not being sad he was dead?
uh, yeah. You're walking pretty fast.
uh, so, any of those three frat guys set off your psycho-killer alarm?
no, no, no. They display a fairly banal mix of social awkwardness, narcissism, inappropriate fantasies -
all within the normal range.
even the ROTC guy?
well, like most overachievers, he displays a slight Oedipal neuroses.
will you share with me why you're so agitated?
you know what? My brother Jared is ruining his life.
Oh, he's drinking again?
no, I'm pretty sure he was dried out before his court-martial.
then why the recent urge to self-destruct?
I set up a perfectly great job interview for him.
but instead, you know what he decides to do?
he wants to just travel across India on his motorcycle.
Yeah, that's right. Talk about a narcissistic dependence on stupidity!
you or him?
this is exactly why I don't talk to you about these kinds of things.
okay. I'm gonna suggest that you're jealous of your brother's decision.
I don't want to go to India.
well, you feel trapped here by your responsible nature, your job, your interpersonal relations. - What?
whereas Jared is completely free.
I am free. I am free as a bird.
free to do whatever I want.
Yeah, but what you're not free to do is control your brother's life.
control Jared? Good luck with that one.
well, it's not for a lack of trying.
of course, you could always get a motorbike and go with him.
motorbike. A motorbike is used for people who deliver pizzas in Amsterdam.
you know, India is large. It's vast.
get a motorcycle.
right. I'd get an American motorcycle.
this dummy is exactly the same weight as the victim, correct?
69. 853 kilograms, yes.
and why are we the only ones here?
Oh, I, uh, asked everyone to leave.
okay, now, I've installed force sensors in the wrists and the back of the spine.
so we should be able to gauge the height from which the victim fell to within a few centimeters after only a few trials.
why did you ask everyone to leave?
are we doing something shameful?
no, it's just...last time I dropped something from up there, it bounced and injured an...innocent bystander.
but nobody's here this time so...
coccyx test number one, Dr. Jack Hodgins supervising.
no. No, no, no.
I...But... - No. No. Stop.
this is an unnecessary experiment.
the height of the fall can be calculated mathematically.
that is true, but I decided to humor Dr. Hodgins so we could bond over a project.
why do you need to bond?
he mistrusts Muslims.
go grab a beer together, but I am saying no to this experiment.
Yeah, I got that during the part where you said "No" seven times in a row.
I find that you don't pay attention to the first six.
he can't drink beer. He's Muslim!
all right. Hodgins and Arastoo have an estimate of how far the victim fell.
1. 37 meters onto a hard surface.
you know what this means, don't you?
Yup. Dr. Brennan's gonna stare at the bones until they speak to her.
so, rock, paper, scissors to see who stays to baby-sit her?
okay. Okay.
yes...
best two out of three.
damn.
booth will want to know.
I found cause of death.
all right.
professor Twardosh wasnotBeaver's sex partner.
okay, did anyone think that? Honestly? Because I did not.
booth believes that the cringe factor was too high, even though cringe factor is not a valid mathematical construct.
believe me, it is, okay?
so, the three boys that owe Beaver the money all have alibis.
four people bought the bogus exam from Beaver.
all members of the golf team.
at the time of his death, though, they were at a tournament in North Carolina.
great. So all we know now is that golfers cheat a lot.
we know that Beaver was killed by being stabbed in the chest.
very small hole. Perhaps an ice pick?
it punctured his aorta. He bled to death internally.
we also know that shortly before he died, he fell backward 1. 37 meters, fracturing his wrists and his coccyx.
okay, so he was stabbed and he fell backwards. That makes sense.
something's bothering me about this.
I went through that kid's computer, and there's absolutely no indication that he had the skill to hack into the university's secure server.
Yeah, well, he probably got his fraternity brothers to hack in for him.
Mr. Vaziri and I will figure out exactly what weapon killed Beaver. - Great.
what are you going to do?
uh, something personal.
what?
personal. Personal means personal, you know? Not for the public.
well, I'm... I'm not the public.
you know, the roads suck in India when they're dry, right?
and-and they turn into rivers when the monsoons come.
I'll tell you what. Trucks don't even give way to anyone.
will you give the lifeguard thing a rest, Seeley?
the State Department has advised that there's a heightened security concern for anyone traveling alone in India.
then come with me.
I mean, that way, you can watch over me every minute.
you know, everywhere you've gone, you've always had the full might of the United States government behind you.
Yeah, I know, I know. You were a frontline guy, a fire-eater, and I was just some rear echelon wimp.
I never said that.
you're so worried, come along.
then I'll have the full might of Seeley Booth behind me.
Seriously?
I didn't think you were serious.
I wasn't when I said it...
but now I am.
Yeah, I'm serious.
you want me to come to India with you?
ball's in your court, brother.
I'm a freshman pledge.
beaver was kinda like my mentor in the fraternity.
when Beaver, uh, your mentor, asked you to hack into Professor Twardosh's files to steal tests, what did you think?
at first, I said no.
but you know what?
beaver was your brother.
that's right.
he was a brother who was on academic probation.
I mean, he was gonna get expelled if he didn't pass the Chem course.
Plus, I know it may not have looked like it from the outside, but Beaver was a great guy.
so, I had to help him.
our computer expert said that some info was erased from Beaver's hard drive.
erased by someone who knew what they were doing.
that was me, too.
jpeg files. I think about 30 of them.
digital photographs. - Yeah.
I didn't see any of them, but before I permanently deleted them,
beaver had asked to put four specific ones onto a USB drive.
so I did.
look... I told you everything okay?
but if my college finds out that I hacked into the Chem test, they're gonna kick me to the curb, okay?
they don't care about brothers.
well, I care about brothers who are great guys, Eli.
but more importantly, I report to the FBI, not Middlesex College.
Thanks.
Hey, what do you got?
we found the hacker, who told Sweets he put some very sensitive images on a USB for Beaver.
a damaged USB drive was amongst the shrapnel that Mr. Vaziri removed from the remains.
there are four JPEG files on this drive.
two of them are total goners. But here's what I got from number three.
concentrate there. Looks like a face.
Yeah, that's Beaver.
is he being tortured?
not exactly.
that's a sex face, Bones.
can you pull up anything else and see who he's with?
no.
but this one's almost done.
is that a cougar?
she could be in her 40s.
okay, print it. We'll see which member of the faculty this one is.
there is no accelerated compression of the bone around the wound.
so, the shaft of the weapon was uniform in thickness.
if there were no lip on the outside, then we'd know it was a projectile that caused the wound.
Yes, a one way trip, so to speak.
but since there was a lip, we know it was a return trip for the weapon into the aorta and back.
as the weapon entered, it was going substantially faster than when it was withdrawn.
a shaft of consistent width.
someone hammered a nail into the victim then pulled it out?
no, not hammered, Mr. Vaziri.
shot.
a nail gun.
a nail gun.
you recognize this woman, Dean Warner?
Yes, I know this woman.
where did you get the photo?
off the victim's computer.
who is she?
her name is Meredith Warner.
she's my wife.
we've been trying to track down your wife, and guess what?
it's been a week since anyone saw her.
you think I killed my wife and James Bouvier?
have you seen the photographs before?
Yes, just over a week ago.
which is when I suggested to Meredith that it was a good time for her to visit her sister in Toronto.
hmm, why was it a good time?
because the boy threatened to put the photos of them together all over the Internet if I didn't let him stay in school.
beaver failed his chemistry test. You were going to expel him.
Yeah, I, uh, declined to be blackmailed.
did the photos ever appear on the Internet?
they did not.
is that because you killed Beaver?
I have nothing more to say to you except that I did not kill the boy.
I'm even a little sorry that he's dead.
so, either arrest me and let me call my lawyer or let me go.
okay.
Vernon Warner, I am placing you under arrest for the murder of James Bouvier.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to remain silent...
it doesn't make sense. I mean, logically, I mean. It doesn't make sense.
Yeah, I know.
the dean kills the kid with a nail gun, then places him in the mascot costume that's full of leftovers?
I know, it doesn't make sense.
no, that's what I said.
exactly, that's what I'm saying, too. It doesn't make sense.
why did you arrest him?
pissed me off, you know? Instead of helping us, he starts screaming for a lawyer.
Jared wants me to go to India with him.
Indiana?
india, okay?
Taj Mahal, cows, tigers, cobras, Slumdog Millionaire.
I know. Are you going?
we don't like each other.
so, not going?
but, I mean, he's my brother so, I love him.
I'm confused. You are going?
I mean, Jared should not go to India alone.
he'll get into all kinds of trouble.
you said he's never been alone.
exactly, you know what? He'll get eaten alive.
well, if you go with him, then he won't be alone.
you won't let him be bad, and his frontal lobe will always be the size of a raisin.
that's what you said.
makes no scientific sense.
Yeah, you said.
got it.
I did an inventory of the nails found in the victim's body.
there were 36.
Arastoo, we know the nail that pierced the aorta was pulled out of the victim.
Yes, but I thought perhaps the killer didn't throw it away.
perhaps he simply left it on the body.
one never knows.
one never does.
I examined the nails very carefully for marks that would confirm it was shot from a nail gun.
a nail gun leaves distinctive marks.
not from the hammering mechanism, you understand, but from the reloading mechanism.
why are you telling me this?
Dr. Brennan said to be especially polite to you when the science was difficult.
how stupid do you people think I am?
booth... - Yeah?
do you recognize this nail?
she's the one you want.
beaver came up to me.
I was working on the float.
he was always hitting on me.
you didn't like Jimmy?
not in that way, you know?
why did you, uh, shoot Beaver with the nail gun?
look, everybody went for a coffee. I stayed.
beaver must've been waiting because he shows up and he's all, "Come on, everybody thinks we're doing it.
you might as well make it official.
and I've been up all night.
all night, right?
working.
so, he moves in closer and sticks his tongue right in my mouth.
that's assault.
right, that is assault.
you're right, it's assault. Go on.
and, you know, I've got this nail gun, and I just pull the trigger and...
beaver falls off the float onto his back and he's hurt.
he's hurt with this nail sticking out of his chest and he says, "Pull it out! Pull it out!
and I say to him, I've seen on TV, things like this, you leave it in.
leave it in!
but he pulls it out himself.
you're right.
and he dies.
everybody believed that we were sleeping together.
maybe they would believe I killed him.
so, I put his body in the mascot uniform before anyone came back.
I have to admit, I'm impressed that you picked her out of the crowd.
how did you do it?
you're not going to believe me anyway.
you're just going to say I guessed.
so, have it your way. I guessed.
no, I don't think you're serious.
I'd like to know what you saw.
thank you so much.
okay...
you're not coming, are you?
you really want me to?
does it matter?
you know, I was going to, I really was, but, um, I think you should go alone.
you think it's a good idea for me to go to India?
Yeah, I do... Alone.
our whole lives as kids, I was always standing behind you.
or you had the navy standing behind you.
but this time, you know, I think you should stand alone.
you don't need your big brother.
Thanks.
so, come as a friend.
we both know I'm not your friend. I'm your big brother.
Yep.
right.
right, so, uh... I got you something.
it's Grandpa's St. Christopher medal.
no, no. It's a new one. I got you that.
Seeley, it looks like the one Grandpa gave you.
no... Grandpa gave me mine when I was shipped out to the Rangers.
this one, I'm giving to you.
patron saint of travelers.
kept me safe in Somalia.
let's hope it does the same for you in India.
you know, wear it around your neck.
I don't know, man. Am I alone if I take a saint with me?
you're not alone.
all right.
Thanks.
your jacket.
how did he take it?
uh, like Jared. Meaning I have no idea.
so, um, do you... Do you really think you have to be bad to be good?
Yeah, I do.
well, I've never done anything bad.
I believe you.
I mean, I've made mistakes, of course, but I've never purposely done anything bad.
and I believe you.
I don't want my frontal lobe to be a dried-up raisin.
you know what? We are gonna do something bad now. - What?
have you ever dined and dashed?
you know the concept, right? We're gonna run out of here without paying the bill.
no, that's stealing.
that's why they call it "bad." - Booth, no.
we're doing something bad. You ready? - No. No, I can't. I really...No!
are you serious?
One...Two... - No...Oh, my God!
are you serious? Oh, my God.
go, go, go, go. Go, go, go! - No.
Oh, God, we're bad! We're bad!
get in the car! - I knew that.
Oh, no!
what is...
is it me, or are we louder stateside?
there are no bombs to drown us out. Right?
right.
are you serious? It's 3: 00 A.M.
it's my boss. - Your boss?
Hannah here and annoyed it's the middle of the night.
at 7: 00?
that's only a few hours away.
do they have my name at the gate?
okay. Thanks.
all right.
what's going on?
Oh, breakfast at the White House.
only five of us were invited, so maybe I can get some real questions answered.
breakfast at 4: 00 A.M?
7: 00. - 7: 00?
but I have to change.
these are the only clothes that I have here.
okay. -- I got to go.
you got to go? -- Yes.
right this second? -- Yes.
Bye. See you tonight.
Seriously? You got to be kidding me.
look. Why can't they find these victims at a reasonable time of the day, huh?
Oh, just look at that.
look how beautiful that is, Bones.
wouldn't it be great to come to work every day at the beach?
no. The sand and the salty air would make research and accurate forensic analysis impossible.
the victim's decomposing at an accelerated rate.
could the acceleration be a result of something chemical or radiological?
no sign of radioactivity and no chemical that I'm aware of that would cause catastrophic cellular necrosis.
what's going on with the maggots?
they're, like, freaky happy.
Yeah, and they're everywhere.
okay! Maggot! Right on the leg.
right there. Can I squash him, or does Hodgins have to interrogate him?
I'll get him.
Dr. Brennan, can you help me lift the victim? Gently.
where are you going?
uh, you know, ID'ing the victim takes forever. I'm going to go get a cup of coffee.
born September 25, 1986.
six-two. 195 pounds.
or you could just check to see if he has a wallet.
decomposition is accelerating, perhaps because of the sunlight.
okay, so what do we got here, huh?
vampire from New Jersey?
before we answer that, I'd like to get him back to the lab.
and we'd better do it quickly.
on three.
one, two, three.
you're stronger than you look.
why, thank you, Dr. Saroyan, and I appreciate your effort to help me feel comfortable at work after my stint at the loony bin.
are you being sarcastic?
no.
it's hard to tell, isn't it?
are you being sarcastic now?
my-my shrink told me that sarcasm is not earnest communication and that I should try to live joyously and genuinely in every moment.
whoa, okay, okay. Everybody, move. Or just-just freeze.
Piophila casei.
more commonly known as "cheese skippers."
under certain circumstances, they jump up and they grab their butts with their mouths.
I met a guy at the hospital that could do that.
yeah?
they have him hopped up on stimulants?
cause that's what's causing this.
we'll screen for amphetamines, ecstasy, cocaine...
that might account for the rapid decomposition.
this was one big, muscly guy.
he had only four-percent body fat.
Really? Jeez. How much did he weigh?
89 kilos.
Really?
this dude was shredded.
tooth veneers over the central and lateral incisors.
this guy must have had a brilliant, engaging smile.
Yeah, I'm sure he lived joyously in the moment.
um... No, we're really, really happy that you-you didn't kill yourself.
Oh, I was never suicidal.
what happened was, I slept 20 hours a day for two months.
my shrink said it was a warning sign.
sounds great to me.
there's a depression fracture at the cranial vertex.
no sign of remodeling.
smashed on top of the head?
I guess I'd better map these microfractures, which will be a satisfying and productive use of my training and abilities.
okay, this one here is our victim, Ritchie the V.
I assume he's called "Ritchie the V" due to his body shape.
what up? This is Ritchie the V.
today, you're going to learn how to get my signature V, baby.
what's going on?
okay, so this one is Li'l Frankie Costello.
he's in most of these videos.
these are what are known as "Guidos."
Yeah, Sweetie, I don't think they actually like to be called that.
but they do. That's what they call themselves, although interestingly, not all Guidos are of Italian descent.
Really?
while the styles and mannerisms are based on Italian-American tropes, the Guidos can be of any ethnic background.
they gather at the Jersey Shore.
the male bonding is near homoerotic.
the friends or "bros" are more important to them than family.
right.
and how do you know all of this?
I stumbled across a compelling documentary about them.
the anthropologist in me was fascinated.
I've been studying their language and customs.
a documentary?
Yes. On television.
sweetie, just because it's called "reality television" doesn't mean that it's a documentary.
I-I'm quite certain you are incorrect about that.
okay.
you sure it's my Ritchie?
Yes, ma'am.
Madonna mia.
um, the autopsy also shows that he may have been assaulted, knocked in the head.
who did this to my Ritchie?
you tell me that right now.
can you think of anyone that would want to hurt your son?
no, Agent Booth.
I cannot think of anyone who would want to hurt my Ritchie.
not anyone. And if I cld think of such an anyone, I would go out there and I would kill them myself, before they ever got anywhere near my kid!
any reason for him to be in trouble?
what kind of trouble?
girlfriends... Um, fighting? -- No.
gambling. -- No.
booze? -- No, nothing like that.
and any trouble he ever did get into was at the urging of that Li'l Frankie, three to one.
Li'l Frankie, three to one.
does he have a last name?
Costello. Ralphy's boy.
any trouble my Ritchie ever got into, it was because of that Li'l Frankie.
what kind of trouble?
Oh, they both got kicked off the high school football team for using steroids.
the urging of that Li' Frankie, just like I said.
but I tell you what.
I put the fear of God into my kid, and he stopped.
I didn't go through 44 hours of labor so my kid could grow up and stick poison in his body.
and you sure he stopped?
Yes, I am.
how is that? -- Because he told me.
Ritchie never lied to me.
not twice, anyway.
when was the last time you saw your little Ritchie?
about a month ago, with Li'l Frankie.
uh, down at the Shore.
they were sharing a house.
Ritchie was very serious about school, and he said this was going to be his last summer to party.
and I guess he was right.
agent Booth, it turns out it was that Li'l Frankie that did this you bring him here, to me.
this is Dr. Brennan.
listen, I got a lead on a suspect.
it's a guy by the name of Frances Costello.
little Frankie. Wait. How do you know?
Oh, he's featured in the Guido video Angela found.
well, the victim's mother fingered Little Frankie.
like Li'l Red Riding Hood, Li'l Abner, Li'l John...
whatever. Okay, you know what?
we should be at the Jersey Shore. Okay? I'm going to come pick you up.
Oh, excellent. I can compare the field experience with the documentary series.
okay. See you in a bit.
Ah, Dr.Brennan. How are you?
I'm well, Mr. Fisher.
have you fully recovered from your mental breakdown?
it's an ongoing process.
well, thank you, Dr. Brennan.
no, I'm not being kind; I'm being factual.
I know.
that's what makes it awesome.
there was extensive damage to the C1 and C2 vertebrae.
it's like the spinous and tranerse processes cracked off internally.
that's exactly what happened.
these processes were broken off by the foramen magnum here.
the cervical column was forced into the victim's skull and then penetrated the base of the brain.
which caused tearing to the major vessels of the brain pan.
the brain would have bled out, thus releasing him into sweet oblivion.
which is death, which is sad... not happy.
Yes, death would have occurred near instantaneously.
I also found a sliver of concrete embedded in the skull wound.
I gave it to Hodgins.
very good, Mr. Fisher.
what's got you so interested?
I've been studying their culture, language and customs.
the Guido tribe is fascinating.
what, is it all right to call them that?
a tribe? Yes.
no, I mean, I don't think it's all right to call them Guidos.
Oh, the Guidos' dance rituals, tattoos, speech patterns, secret lexicons and ornate costumes are obvious markers.
they're dumb-ass kids.
Yes.
the avid focus on mating suggests a kind of protracted adolescence.
"kids" and "dumb-ass" refer to their... determined resistance to maturity.
this is Dr. Brennan.
we know why the cheese skippers were literally flipping out.
Ephedra.
probably from energy drinks.
synthetic adrenaline.
Yeah, the maggots ingested it from the tissue, and it made them ravenous.
which explains why his remains decomposed so quickly.
now, extrapolating the time it took for a one-gram sample of flesh to be devoured, the victim died between 40 and 52 hours ago.
there's more.
glycerin, surfactants, lanolin, petrolatum, vegetable oil, coconut oil, and copious amounts of artificial fragrance.
basically, he looked and smelled great when he died.
okay.
the tox screen showed high levels of alcohol, over-the-counter stimulants and men's beauty products.
I'm sorry, men's what now?
hairspray, hair gel, tanning spray and some sort of aerosolized perfume.
cologne. Men wear cologne.
you don't.
that's because it smells like perfume.
this is the perfect environment for the tribe to preen and mate.
it's like trying to find a Guido in a haystack.
booth.
Hey, Hannah.
uh, yeah, just... You know what, hey, hell, move all your stuff in.
say hi for me.
uh... No, I'm serious.
listen, uh, Bones says hi.
Hannah says hi.
everybody says hi.
okay.
uh, listen, mi casa es su casa.
right. Talk to you later. Bye.
that was, uh... that was very casual.
what?
you inviting Hannah to move in with you.
I mean, usually there's more ceremony.
I hope she didn't feel cheated.
it's not like we haven't talked about it before, Bones.
Eureka!
a gathering of Guidos!
I believe that's Little Frankie.
all Go!
given the excessive amounts of stimulants and alcohol, it's possible that Ritchie the V simply fell down, fracturing his cerebellum on the concrete.
one!
two!
three!
either that, or he was just tossed head first straight into the concrete by a bunch of drunken idiots.
that certainly would fit in to their tribal customs.
watch yourself there.
FBI Agent Booth.
what's your name, pretty lady?
Oh, I'm Dr. Temperance Brennan of the Jeffersonian.
Sup? Yo,'sup?
well, Dr. Temperance Brennan of the Jeffersonian, how about when you finish with all your policing or whatnot, you and your hot-for-teacher friends come and meet me down at Club Elegante tonight?
know what I'm saying?
okay, why don't we all just take one swollen step back.
you, Muscles Marinara, when was the last time you saw Ritchie Genaro.
thursday -- him and Pepe Dio went creeping.
Oh, creeping is when males go in search of females for the purpose of having sex.
right. Thanks, Bones. Got that.
so, uh, was Pepe the last person who saw Ritchie?
is Pepe in some sort of trouble?
well, that's what we're here to find out.
so, where's Pepe now?
he's doing a GTL.
what's a GTL?
gym, tan, laundry.
Wha... All right, Ritchie and Pepe, Thursday night -- what happened?
I don't know, the V hasn't been back since.
we just thought he pulled some ho-bag or skank or something, you know?
I mean, that's the V's weakness.
Ho-bags and skanks...-- Got it.
all right, so Pepe and Ritchie, they have any arguments, they fight?
they fought over a stupid T-shirt.
shut the hole, Jo!
whatever.
okay, wha... They fought over a T-shirt?
pepe got his drink on before going to the club.
he went to pick up Ritchie, who was wearing the exact same Fred McCarty T-shirt.
pepe didn't want to be twinsies, so they got into it.
so the bro's were mixing it up, yo.
Yeah, but they made up and wore the same shirt anyway.
well, the victim was wearing a Fred McCarty shirt.
that's true.
victim?
is Ritchie all right?
no. No, he's dead.
Frankie, baby, what is it?
Ritchie's dead!
the V? -- What?!
the V! The V's dead!
Oh, my God.
M. G!
Loretta, someone killed Ritchie!
which Ritchie!
tan Ritchie?
no, Ritchie the V!
Oh, my God!
someone killed Ritchie the V!
No! Not Ritchie!
well, cat's out of the bag now.
what these guys do is combine the alcohol with highly caffeinated energy drinks containing pseudoephedrine.
Yeah, lots of posturing, muscles and fighting over girls.
like many tribes, the markers that define a man involve sex and violence.
look, Ritchie was hooking up with someone who was hooking up with someone else.
bottom line there.
the answer could be right in here.
these copies of his text messages just seem to be random letters.
some kind of code?
wait, like "TTFN."
ta-ta For Now.
I'm pretty good at these.
great. Here you go. All yours. Call when you're done.
okay.
TTFN.
Hey, Temperance.
hello.
is this a bad time?
um, for what?
for us to talk?
no.
no, this is a fine time for that.
come in.
this place is totally cool.
it's like working in a spaceship.
I wouldn't know.
I-I trained for a shuttle mission once but never got to go.
you're quite literal, aren't you?
Yes. I find I avoid a lot of misunderstandings if I merely deal with facts.
well, the reason I'm here, um... Seeley asked me to move in with him.
I... can't really give you advice about that.
I don't know you that well, and there are so many factors: sexual compatibility...
no.
I'm doing it.
I came back from Afghanistan to be with him.
then... congratulations.
you must be happy.
you and Booth.
we are.
but I was thinking, I wanted to get him something when I moved in-- a present and since you know him so well... -- A telephone.
get him a telephone.
I was thinking something a little more personal.
a vintage rotary phone.
booth loves them and hasn't been able to find the right one.
Really? -- Yes.
he's been looking.
he says that's what a phone is supposed to be, indestructible and heavy enough to knock someone out.
Yeah, that-that sounds like Seeley.
his grandfather kept his rotary phone until it fell apart.
booth loved the feel of the Bakelite, the tick-tick-tick of the dial as it turned.
he says the mechanics make it human.
and lucky for me, he has a partner who knows him so well.
booth and I have become very close.
by necessity.
congratulations again.
I'm happy for you both.
Thanks.
one thing, Hannah.
I want you to be sure about this.
the phone?
no. Although I understand the misunderstanding.
no. About you and Booth moving in together.
booth will give himself to you completely and it would be very painful for him if you aren't as serious about the relationship as he is.
I am.
but thanks, though.
you're a good friend, Temperance.
Seeley is very lucky.
my shrink thought I should get out of the forensic anthropology business.
I tried to explain, it's not violent death that makes me morbidly depressed.
it was life.
and he thinks that explanation shows a positive attitude?
Oh, I'm quite positive about my job.
for example, these injuries, how cool are they?
there's a perimortem bruise near the depression fracture.
that must've hurt.
another cheery thought - once I remove the scalp, subscalpular hemorrhaging was apparent.
that means there were two injuries to the head.
which means for the victim to have taken a swan dive onto the pavement, he would've had to do it twice.
is there enough Red Bull and vodka in the world to explain that?
most likely, he was struck in the head twice by the same weapon.
what did Hodgins say about the concrete sample?
it's called minute-crete, and it's not a match of the sample taken from the shore house.
we should do a search for any weapons that could be made of minute-crete.
don't look at me that way, dude.
you don't know how good you got it.
Angela, can you run a search on possible weapons made from minute-crete?
Yeah, sure.
something that could cause fractures and subscalpular hemorrhaging... Oh, my God!
what?
you're... - Oh, I'm, yeah, I'm messy.
I know I shouldn't eat lying down.
pregnant.
you're pregnant.
what? Pregnant?
me? No-no. No.
you've got that whole glowy thing, and the crackers...
nobody eats crackers for pleasure.
okay, listen, I've been feeling a little bit queasy, but you cannot tell anybody about this.
I was right! I knew it!
are you happy about this?
Yes, we're-we're thrilled.
I mean, I could be having a little Hodgins.
how cute would that be?
Oh, maybe you should lie down.
uh, no. I'm... I'm okay actually.
I'm feeling pretty good.
I can do anything, you know?
I would hope that you could keep this between us, because nobody else knows.
Oh, of course. Just you and me.
okay, I mean, you can't even tell Hodgins that you know, um, because he wants to make some sort of big announcement at the right time.
I won't breathe a word. -- Okay.
I'm just so happy! This is so great, Angela!
I... Oh... -- What is?
that... she is...
that I... I have a, um...
I have a database of concrete items that can kill someone, and today is the first day that I can use it, so I am over the moon.
Yes.
and you shouldn't disturb her, Mr. Fisher.
I wanted to give you the measurements of the injuries, the dispersal of fracturing.
great. Great. Fantastic.
and I'll go away now.
I just can't get as stoked about work as you guys can.
right.
Hey, yo, put on the brakes. You two on the list?
look, let me handle this.
Yo.'Sup. Yeah.
the list.
FBI, okay? We're here about a murder.
listen, the victim was here at this establishment with this guy.
uh, is here tonight?
Oh, yeah, he's right there, see? Him. No, no, no. Him.
him?
okay, you know what? I'll tell you want. We'll go scope the place out ourselves, all right?
do your thing. -- Yeah. Whatever.
notice the two unpaired females.
their body movements and attire suggest they are available for mating.
bones, we're looking for Peppy.
Oh, over there. -- Where? Peppy?
no, no. Two males have spotted the available females and will approach and begin the exhibition.
fascinating. -- Fascinating?
more like pitiful.
now the males are displaying their musculature, indicating they're good breeders.
this activity shows that these two will soon mate, and the other suitors will continue their search elsewhere.
okay, just remember, we're here looking for Peppy.
excuse me. FBI. You ladies recognize this guy?
no.
get back here! Stop that guy!
you're toast, man! You're toast!
look. It's him.
Hey, you. FBI! Hold it right there.
Yeah, right.
Hey, cool it.
Yeah, you gonna pay for that.
come on!
fight! Fight!
no. Get off me! Get off me!
this posturing is called throwing the crab. It will intimidate him into compliance.
Yeah, what was that about?
these idiots think ice is free, and it's not.
they're always in my way. They never let me do my job.
look, I got to account for every single cube.
ice is frozen water, yo. Water's free. Do the math, dipstick.
put on some lip gloss, Mary.
I will 'cause your mother likes my lips soft.
Oh, he's suggesting that he had sex with his mother. -- Right, got that, Bones.
steroid freak. -- Who's the one who goes ballistic over water?
Yeah, like you even know what ballistic means.
you can go home now. Come on, go.
ballistic, as in referring to from the balls.
no, that's not even close to an accurate definition.
ballistic refers to projectile in flight.
so can I make like a ballistic now?
no, you cannot make like a ballistic now, because you were the last person who saw Ritchie Genaro alive.
seriously, yo, Ritchie was my boy. How am I gonna kill my boy?
knocking him over the head.
you don't seem very upset.
it's killing me, but I got to keep on for Ritchie.
he would have wanted me to keep on. You feel me?
he's asking if we understand.
so, his mother says you guys were doing steroids.
one cycle -- that was all for Ritchie.
and I don't use roids. Not anymore.
Ritchie got me off 'em.
proved they would shrink my ballistics.
so Ritchie only did anabolic steroids once?
his mother would kill him, like, for real.
all right, look, can you think of anyone who'd want to kill Ritchie, besides his mother?
his stalker?
his stalker have a name?
I don't know her name.
I didn't see her there tonight.
I could describe her. -- Okay.
she got dark hair, dark skin, big hair.
Ah, like everybody in this club.
well, would Ritchie's stalker be aggressive enough to strike him over the head hard enough to force his skull down over his spine?
shut your mouth! Skank!
cat fight!
I withdraw the question, mm-hmm.
okay, comparing the concrete sample to the injuries on the victim's skull, the weapon appears to have a curved edge.
okay, completing the arc.
the murder weapon was some sort of concrete cylinder?
with a 3.175 centimeter diameter.
like a plumbing pipe.
Yeah, or a tetherball pole.
this is so random, yo.
in the vernacular.
while I was studying all the text messages, I created this overview of what Dr. Brennan calls the tribe, seen through digital lines of communication. This is our victim.
he texted all these women?
Yeah, and these are women who texted other men.
Oh, it's like a jealousy map.
Yeah. -- Good work.
thank you.
so look at what I stumbled across.
a week before the victim was murdered, over 200 texts were exchanged between the victim and a woman named Marie Galasso.
arrow slash three?
Oh, that means a broken heart.
am I too much to handle, sexy?
so they were together once, and she expected more?
why aren't you down for sex?
and then there's this one 2-G-2-B-4-G.
too good to be forgotten.
so this is where it gets really ugly.
Ritchie texts Marie that she was just a grenade.
a grenade?
Yeah, a grenade is an overweight, undesirable woman that one must jump on so a friend can get with a prettier girl.
and this really set Marie off.
she calls him a bunch of curse words, some of which I had to look up.
sounds like motive to me.
Yeah, and after that, Ritchie texts his friends wherever he's headed to find out if she's gonna be there.
so, she was stalking him.
check this out.
you'll be sorry.
followed by U-R-GNG-2-DI.
you are going... -- You are going to die.
think that's pretty self-explanatory.
why don't you just sit down, Marie? -- No. I ain't tired.
how is it that a little thing like you could kidnap a strong guy like Ritchie?
what happened? Did you find him with another woman?
I ain't sayin' nothin'!
Okay."I ain't sayin' nothin'" means you're guilty.
no, I ain't saying nothin' not 'cause I'm guilty.
I ain't not saying nothin' because I loved him.
I loved Ritchie, and he loved me, okay? I'm not just some shore whore.
we had plans, and Ritchie -- he wasn't just some Guido, okay?
he was going to school to be a therapist.
he was gonna do stuff and be somebody and like that. Okay?
I knew him on a very deep level.
he wasn't no juice head or no knucklehead.
he was a gentleman.
okay, I get it. He was a gentleman.
why don't you just sit down and just relax?
now, let's say you didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him!
I loved him. You know what? You want to put me in prison for love, go ahead, okay?
I'm guilty as charged, sweetheart.
you said you knew him on a deep level?
Yes, I did.
okay, then, why is he dead? Was he afraid of someone?
that's funny.
Ritchie the V feared no man, but there was somebody scared of him, maybe wanted him quiet.
who?
the trainer at the gym who was selling roids. Okay?
Ritchie busted the guy.
this guy have a name?
they call him Terror.
he works the door at Club Elegante.
right.
Hey, Sweets. Turns out our victim, Ritchie, ratted out a steroid dealer.
that same dealer works as a bouncer in Club Elegante.
why did you shut the door?
well, I have to speak to you, Agent Booth.
okay, that tone of voice sounds like you want to speak at me.
I hear that you asked Hannah to move in with you?
so? -- As your friend...
this isn't a shrinky visit? -- No.
so, then, from one friend to another, I'm fine.
everything's great. Nothing to worry about.
okay, there might be a little shrinky stuff, because that's who I am.
okay, thanks, friend.
you know, the relationship that you and Hannah have it was forged in a highly adrenalized environment.
well, yeah, we were in war together.
I mean, our relationship is literally battle tested.
right, but a new environment, you know, a calmer one with fewer distractions. -- it alters your dynamic.
I just don't want you to jump into anything too soon.
it's great. You know, I really appreciate that, Sweets.
but Hannah is bringing all of her stuff over tonight.
I even went, and I got her some bathroom stuff, a set of new of new sheets.
I mean, what kind of guy does something that crazy if he isn't sure?
hard to argue with that.
right. -- I just had to say something, you know?
Yeah, you're a good kid.
Oh, boy.
I was looking at bone fragments from the top of the skull, and I found these.
I'm taking out the remaining sliver that were buried in the fractures.
well, it's not bone.
some kind of yellow polymer.
it's possibly polyvinyl chloride or polytetrafluoroethylene.
so he had concrete and plastic in his head?
Oh, no. Uh, you okay?
are you gonna ask me that every time I yawn?
possibly.
I don't want you to fall asleep again for another two months, Van Winkle.
all right.
gonna figure out what this plastic is from.
it might help Angela narrow down the murder weapon.
okay.
so, when Ritchie ratted out Terror for selling drugs, he lost his job at the gym, all of his clients. It was a mess.
can I help you?
Yeah. Why don't you tell us what happened between you and your buddy Ritchie.
I'm guessing it didn't go very well since he's dead.
I don't have to say nothing.
I'm the doorman of this establishment, so I'm going to ask you guys to leave.
I wouldn't be acting like a bouncer right now.
booth, the storage room.
no.
did you just shove my partner?
Oh, you're real bad, with a gun and a badge.
but you won't always be on duty. You know what I'm saying?
no, I don't know what you're saying; I want you to spell it out for me.
I mean, watch your back.
Oh, no. -- You shouldn't threaten Agent Booth.
he can be very male.
I don't like walking around, looking over my shoulder, huh?
so what do you say we do this right now?
all right, listen.
my boss holds me responsible for everything in that storage room.
I wasn't looking for trouble.
you're not looking for trouble? He's not looking for trouble, which means you are giving Bones permission to look in the storage room.
booth? -- Yeah?
look. Yellow plastic and concrete.
fine, whatever.
Yeah, Ritchie ratted on me, and I was pissed.
but I didn't kill him.
is this really necessary?
then where were you last Thursday night?
at work. -- No, you weren't at work.
I didn't kill Ritchie the V.
where were you?
you know, if I were you, I'd plead "'roid rage."
I got an alibi.
you can't just have an alibi. You got to share it with the world.
I took my ma up to New York to see Billy Elliot.
Billy Elliot?
Yeah, the boy that dances. Yeah.
you like musicals?
that's why I wasn't forthcoming about my alibi.
there's some joys in life you want to keep to yourself.
Billy Elliot is a joy?
it's beautiful, dude.
the boy is an angel.
right. I'll tell you what.
I'm going to find somebody who knows the show and you're going to tell it to them, the whole story, and then we'll see if you really saw Billy Elliot with your mother.
Oh, I can perform the whole thing.
word for word.
this plastic sliver is curved, just like the minute-crete was.
well, they look pretty close.
Oh, so close.
both fragments were in the skull wound, but how did they get there if they weren't part of the same weapon?
that's a good question.
well, since the plastic doesn't fit inside the circle, how about trying it on the outside?
okay. That worked.
Yeah. All right. Great. Then what did we just find out?
plastic-covered cement.
concrete.
I'm just being precise.
you know, cement is the ingredient in concrete that keeps everything, you know, together.
right.
uh, right. Like...
I totally suck.
terror told the whole story of Billy Elliot. He even teared up a couple of times.
it is a touching story of triumph over background and adversity.
well, his mom even backed him up. They even have receipts.
you don't think he did it? -- Timeline doesn't even add up.
let's sit up here.
okay, Ritchie's friends say that he disappeared on Thursday. Right.
and the body was found buried in the sand the next Monday.
cam and Hodgins say that the body only took two days to decompose.
exactly. So, either they're wrong or two days remain unaccounted for.
look, your squints could have gotten it wrong.
don't do that. Don't do that.
what?
I have an idea of how those two days went missing.
I have to call Fisher.
what are you doing?
Dr. Brennan had some kind of a brainstorm, and it looks like she was right.
you say that like it's bad news.
I should have thought of it.
okay.
first, tell me the brainstorm.
note the microfractures in the Haversian Canals.
Yes, from a blow to the skull?
these are from the victim's femur.
the victim was frozen for two days.
that's what caused the micro-fractures.
Oh, why are you yawning? Are you depress...? Don't yawn.
I suck.
how long ago did Dr. Brennan have her brainstorm?
about 45 minutes ago.
so, basically, you're 45 minutes behind arguably the greatest forensic anthropologist in the nation?
that's one way to look at it.
I'm not a psychiatrist, but seems to me that when your shrink says look on the bright side, he means give yourself the benefit of the doubt.
yeah?
Yeah.
the victim was killed and then frozen?
apparently. -- Put on ice?
metaphorically speaking.
or not.
what do you -- what do you mean or not?
what?
what did I miss?
no, what did I miss?!
studies have shown that when frozen properly, a body's cell deterioration stops and can be held in that state nearly indefinitely.
but in order to avoid micro-fractures, when a person wants to be preserved cryogenically, they need to be flash frozen.
I get it, Bones. -- I should have seen it earlier, because when a body is frozen slowly the decomposition rate speeds up as a body thaws.
look, plastic filled with concrete. That's the murder weapon.
you killed the wrong guy.
what do you mean? -- Ritchie the V didn't steal your ice.
it was his roommate.
they were wearing the same shirt.
you and Peppy were hollering at each other. He takes off. You see Ritchie in the same shirt.
maybe you threatened him with your Wiffle bat.
he doesn't know that the bat's filled with cement.
he comes at you... -- You hit him twice.
then you put him on ice for two days. Then you bury him at the beach.
I'm just trying to make a living.
you know what it's like to be overrun by these morons?
every delivery they screw with me. Take my ice. And I lost it.
you know, Peppy -- he's a real douche.
and I'm sure he's got his beatings coming to him down the line, but Ritchie, Ritchie was a good guy.
all he was doing was looking for a good time up at the Jersey Shore.
what can I say?
they all look alike.
when you said you didn't need us to help you move in, I thought you were merely being polite.
I don't really do that.
I'm still... This is everything you own in the world?
it's the life I choose.
Yeah, she travels light. I used to travel light.
booth won't even have to make room for you.
Hey, man of the house.
come on in. Pretend you live here.
what's going on?
Oh, my God.
did you not mean it when you said I could move in?
no, I... Yes, I wanted you to move in.
we offered to help her, but... -- This is everything.
you're basically taking in a homeless woman.
I prefer the term nomad.
I used to be a nomad. Who drank wine.
you don't drink wine anymore?
no.
and he just got it.
Hey, congratulations!
thank you. That's so great.
listen, you have to act surprised when Hodgins tells you, okay?
promise.
you're going to be a great mom.
thank you.
Ooh, speaking of which, I've got to get home to Michelle, and I don't want to reek of wine.
Yeah, I should probably get home to Mr. Hodgins.
Bye, guys. -- Bye.
Congratulations. -- Thank you.
Hey, wait for me.
okay. Welcome home.
what's that?
Oh, uh, it's a housewarming gift.
a Bakelite, original.
do you like it?
Hey, it's a real one.
Temperance told me that you liked phones, so... -- No, I love it.
Thanks.
you're welcome. -- You're welcome.
great.
see you tomorrow.
Oh, no. Stay.
do you want to join us for dinner?
Yeah. I can make my famous mac and cheese.
no. Traditionally when two people share a domicile for the first time, the person who doesn't leaves.
see you tomorrow.
well, thanks for your help.
Hey, Bones.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes.
tomorrow.
I- I can't imagine going from being a woman to being a mom.
when Parker was born, everything changed in my life-- everything.
like what? - Well, "everything." "Everything" means "everything.
temperance, this is delicious.
the Garbanzo Palau is in honor of your time in Afghanistan.
garbanzos are also very good for pregnancy.
the B6 will help with your morning sickness.
Oh, well, I'll let you know about that tomorrow.
watch this. Okay, Bones, do your thing.
here we go. - Okay.
pelvic diameter indicates female;
with strong muscle attachments, suggesting free-range.
hairline fracture to the tibiatarsus, indicating that she struggled as her feet were restrained, - prior to her head being severed. - Retch.
thank you for waiting until after we ate to show us that trick, Booth.
looks like someone besides this chicken got murdered.
woodland is some creepy neighborhood.
Yeah, when someone dies around here, it's 90% gang-related.
is that an actual statistic, or one of your illustrative descriptions?
definitely the second one; definitely the second.
the tree actually grew through the victim.
cornus florida, more commonly known as the flowering dogwood.
well, the modern zipper was invented in 1913.
the skeleton is still articulated, so she hasn't been here longer than two years.
she? - Yes, it's a female.
my turn. Human remains:
one week on the surface equals about eight weeks in a shallow grave.
I'd estimate three weeks to one year?
okay, bug-boy, you're up! Find a bug and tell me time of death.
no can do. Carrion-feeding insects have less access to bodies underground.
but... there could be some evidence in the growth patterns of the tree that could tell us when she was buried here.
you mean, when it might have been buried fertilized?
okay, that's it! Tree back to the lab. I get it.
they're not going to like this one.
high, narrow nasal route and straight profile: Caucasian.
Yeah, it's Booth. Listen, I need a 24-foot flatbed.
I got to transport a tree. Yeah, that's right, a tree: T-R-E-E.
excellent dental work.
expensive. - Oh, a rich white woman.
she would have stood out in this neighborhood like a lighthouse.
I estimate height at 1. 75 to 1. 8 meters tall.
between five-foot-eight and five-foot-nine.
athletic, well-muscled.
let's estimate weight at...
63 kilograms. - 140 pounds.
right. So basically the same height and weight as you, huh, Bones?
Oh, what?
nothing.
that garbanzo thing totally worked.
I mean, if you want to be in charge of my nutrition for the entire pregnancy, you've got the job.
except I do need pastries, a lot of pastries.
sugar stresses your pancreas.
okay. You are not really here.
so what's the story, morning glory?
I don't know what that means.
it means you're behaving strangely, and I'm... I'm asking you why.
the victim.
does she remind you of anyone?
sweetie, when you describe people in generalities, like age and size, it fits a lot of people.
your dolphin ring. So what?
it's not mine.
it's the victim's.
I mean, technically, a lot of people like dolphins.
and unless you get your jewelry custom made, there could be hundreds of people wearing what I'm wearing right now.
you're making sense.
okay.
there's a longitudinal fracture to the right temporal bone.
cause of death? - Yes. Deep enough to suggest a fatal blow.
severe nightstick fracture to the left ulna, suggesting the victim raised her arms in a defensive posture.
she was beaten to death. Fits the neighborhood.
I removed this from the remains last night.
I noted it in the evidence log, but I forgot to hand it over.
it's not like you, to forget things.
the ring is unlikely to be probative evidence in a murder charge.
well, it might help us with identification. This looks really familiar.
angela says it's a very common piece of jewelry.
notice the bony growths on the third and fourth fingers-- media phalanges.
occupational markers? - Yes.
usually caused by using tools in this manner.
seamstress? Some kind of artist?
I bet you and I both have that same occupational marker on our fingers.
we should add medical professional to the list of possibilities.
have you found anything interesting, Dr. Hodgins?
there's something funky about the leaves.
Funky" means bad-smelling or, when applied to music, marked by an earthy, bluesy quality.
in this case, funky means weird.
meanwhile, look at this.
the rings correspond to seasons.
now, wide rings develop during a tree's growing season.
when the tree gets maximum nutrients.
right. And the skinny rings develop during the winter, when a tree grows more slowly.
but note here, two wide rings in a row;
suggesting that last winter, this tree was particularly well-fed.
the victim's decomposing body.
Yes. Which brings us to the roots.
this root was probably damaged when the body was buried, about 11 months ago.
last November.
it gets you every single time.
the "slow clap. " You get misty.
that holds no meaning for me.
makes a speech, stands up to authority...
the old guy gets up; he starts clapping.
really slow at first, and then everybody joins in.
the "slow clap.
have you IDed the victim yet?
Aw, the description was too general.
Yes, even though Cam and I discovered that she was very likely a surgeon.
how's that? - Occupational markers on the phalanges.
uh, a surgeon named Dr. Lauren Eames disappeared last November.
I checked Bing.
D. C. Metro missing persons investigated.
the case went cold; it didn't go anywhere.
how can that be? The woman was a surgeon.
single, no kids.
outside of people at work, there was no one to miss her.
I brought along Lauren's schedule for the six months before she died;
her case load, her interns.
it's everything I can provide without contravening patient confidentiality.
Dr. Eames have any enemies?
no. Lauren was not a woman of passion.
some residents complained they were overworked and underappreciated, but nothing out of the ordinary.
like you and your squinterns there, eh, Bones?
no, I appreciate them.
right. So what about her personal life?
look at her schedule.
Lauren didn't have any time for a personal life.
rumors, nothing?
the Transplant Services Helicopter Team. - Sounds scandalous.
I heard the pilot had a thing for Lauren.
unrequited. Lots of sexual tension.
got a name? - Chris Markham.
what are these, please?
Dr. Eames' case files.
she dictated them for transcription.
I thought maybe if you heard her voice...
Why? It's the content that matters, not the tone of voice.
Lauren was the best cardiac surgeon on the Eastern Seaboard.
I find that hard to believe. - Why?
We-e... We didn't hear about it.
excuse me? - Well,Dr. Brennan just wonders why someone of that importance could just disappear...
so... so quietly.
I will show you fear in a handful of dust.
we don't actually fear death; we fear that...
that no one will notice our absence;
that we will disappear without a trace.
that sounds correct.
what is this? - Dr. Eames' photo ID.
I-I-I-I-I really must get back to the hospital.
all right. I'll show you to the elevator.
does this look like anyone to you?
um, she looks nice, but no, no one I know.
you're in a big hurry, Bones. You all right?
I, um... I have a lot of questions, that's all.
burning the midnight oil, Doc?
Hello, Micah.
you awake because you're intellectually invigorated or because you're worried?
I am awake because I can't sleep.
I'm having trouble being objective regarding this case.
I attended this lecture where this philosopher guy says that for something to be objective, it must be separate from the mind, and nothing is separate from the mind
ergo, ipso facto, Colombo, Oreo.
not all of that was real Latin, Micah.
no, if there's no such thing as objectivity, then there's no such thing as measurement, which means that empiricism is meaningless.
I only attended one lecture on the subject, Doc.
it doesn't make me an expert.
patient is Abigail Anker-- A-N-K-E-R.
date of birth 10/14/1996.
medical record 19846.
cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. John Frank.
I was called in to consult.
14-year-old female with Down syndrome, complex heart disease consisting of atrioventricular septal defect.
pulmonary atresia...
...further discussion at the Cardiothoracic Surgery Case Conference in Atlanta.
speaking of which, will somebody please remind me to buy a damn ticket?
you laughing because you figured something out?
will you listen to this?
that's, that's very strange.
I-I find I'm very glad to hear you say that.
it's like a voice beyond the grave.
like my voice? - Very similar, yeah.
it sounds exactly like my voice.
she is me.
she isn't you.
she's her and you're you. You're alive and she's dead.
ergo, ipso facto, Colombo, Oreo.
those last two words-- one is the capital of Sri Lanka and the other is... a cookie.
it sounds like Latin.
I-I see, you're illustrating the fact that something can sound like something and not actually be that something.
well, you're giving me way too much credit, Doc.
what happened to her?
see these, these cuts on the edge of the ribs?
stabbed?
Yes, but the ribs were healing at her time of death.
so that's not what killed her?
no. No, she was almost certainly killed by a blow to the head.
how long after she was stabbed? - Four to six months.
and in that time, no one at work mentioned that she was walking around groaning and bleeding?
some people are very adept at keeping their pain hidden.
I guess I always figured that Lauren just up and went, you know, took off to Africa or Iraq or something.
she'd do something like that without telling you?
Lauren always followed her own kind of logic.
you couldn't ask any of her friends?
if she had friends I didn't know any of 'em.
what the hell was Lauren doing in Woodland?
it appears the victim was stabbed on her right side perhaps a year or so ago.
when did you find that out? - Last night
I'm sorry, I forgot, I forgot to tell you.
she was stabbed? - Yes.
Lauren told me that she broke a couple ribs falling off a bicycle.
can you think of any problems she was having that could get her stabbed?
no, no, not really.
I think his name was Darcy, Dorsey, something like that.
you think he stabbed her?
can't you just check with emergency rooms?
she would have been capable of stitching the wound herself.
Why? I mean, why would Lauren get stabbed and then not report it?
well, usually when a woman doesn't report an assault, it's a domestic.
Lauren wasn't married, and she didn't have a boyfriend.
you weren't her boyfriend? - No.
Oh, okay, I see, you wanted to get a little bit more there with Lauren Eames, and she turned you down.
every time.
maybe she was right. We're polar opposites, but, man, I could swear I saw in her eyes that she wanted more, an-and then she was just gone.
it's a myth that a person's intentions and desires can be seen in the eyes.
look in my eyes.
is that a myth?
okay, you know what? Stop making crazy eyes at my partner here.
it's not making your case any good. Let's go, Bones, come on.
Sam Dworsky is an eight-year-old with severe hypoplastic left heart syndrome who presented with cyanosis and tachycardia at Metro Clinic.
Dworsky-- that could be the patient to whom the pilot was referring.
I'm sure you've got a reason for not giving them what they wanted.
why are you spying on me?
whoa, no, Dr. Brennan, I was just waiting here so as not to startle you.
did Booth call you?
would it bother you if he did?
of course. Doesn't anybody know me at all?
I think we know you as much as you'll allow.
you're a very private person and we respect that, but it has been mentioned to me several times by Booth and Dr. Saroyan and Angela that you seem to be particularly distressed by this case.
uh, would you like to discuss any of it with me?
is that the victim? - What do you see?
what do you want me to see?
sweets, she-she's exactly like me. I mean, look, she is me.
Yeah, I see.
you do? Because, because Booth didn't.
what I see is that you're over identifying with the victim.
brilliant scientist, unmarried, without children, consumed by her work.
you can't help but draw parallels to your own life.
the victim was afraid of a man named Dworsky.
will you tell Booth that?
Yeah, I'll tell him.
okay.
medical record 20381.
this represents the particulates I found in the head wound
soil from the burial mostly, the victim's own hair, but this is interesting.
epoxy colophony? Isn't that found in tree sap?
Yes, yellow sap, to be precise. - From the tree?
no, Cornus florida-- dogwood-- is hardwood.
epoxy colophony comes from pine trees, which, mixed with this
polymethyl methacrylate...
I come up with a manufactured reflective coating.
so, the victim was bludgeoned with a reflective surface.
booth is ready to talk with our prime suspect now.
good work, Hodgins.
that's Mike Dworsky? - Yeah, that's him.
you know, I checked his record, but it's pretty clean.
well, according to the victim, he has a very bad temper.
you know, I wish you hadn't gotten Sweets to come and talk to me.
come on, I'm a meddlesome kind of a guy.
Dworsky, Mr. Dworsky. FBI, Special Agent Booth.
this here is my associate Dr. Brennan.
I don't care who you are.
you park in this zone, you get towed. - That's not my car.
we're here to ask you about Dr. Lauren Eames.
that's water under the bridge.
my son's doing fine, no thanks to her.
no hard feelings neither. - No hard feelings about what?
a donor heart came up-- perfect match for my boy
and Dr. Eames-- she said no.
well, according to her transcripts, he had a severe respiratory infection brought on by pleural effusion.
he had a cold, and for that, she said no to a new heart.
it was a rational decision.
well, I'll give you that. The woman is rational.
I'll tell you what else-- if she suddenly or rationally decided that there were too many people in the world, she'd unleash a plague.
you're saying she was cold-hearted?
like Antarctica.
what do you mean "was"?
someone beat her to death with something exactly like this.
bones, what are you doing?
it's, it's not like you to pick up something that could be evidence.
I want a lawyer.
Charlie Whaling. Primary care physician--Dr. Megan Rasmussen.
Megan keeps trying to set me up with her son the drooling magpie, if you can believe it.
people assume that when you are alone, you must be lonely.
like most assumptions, it's erroneous.
did you hear what I said about Charlie?
Yes.
you seem distracted. It's important.
I met Chris Markham, your helicopter pilot.
I'm not sure you can call Chris mine.
my biggest regret is not accepting what Chris offered me.
he asked me to look into his eyes, and...
although it's not rational, I...
I believe I perceived pain.
we both know that it's a sentimental myth that emotions can be seen in the eyes.
Charlie Whaling, nine years old, presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage after automobile collision.
emergency HCT showed extensive damage around the aneurysm, which had thrombosed.
he rapidly deteriorated to a point of complete expressive aphasia and right hemiplegia.
brain dead? - Yes.
so, he required life support?
but my pleas to his family to give up his organs went unheeded.
musing out loud.
in the nine years that we've known each other, I've never heard you do that before.
actually...
Micah, I was having a conversation with the victim.
I ask her questions, and...
she answers.
tell you what, Doc. Don't be mentioning that to anybody else but me, okay?
Why?
cause, uh, they'll think you've gone nuts.
do you think I've gone nuts?
people often report, in times of great stress, they hear a voice telling them what to do.
Jump!" "Don't walk down that alley!" Like that.
like intuition.
I don't believe in intuition.
well, maybe that's why your brain is resorting to talking to you directly.
I went to this lecture where this neurosurgeon said that we understand the dark side of the moon better than our own brains.
do you attend every lecture the Jeffersonian puts on?
hell, yes.
what, you think I took this job for the hours and the health benefits?
so, Dworsky has an alibi?
Yeah. Tell you, the killer had to have buried Lauren Eames in that park.
it had to have been in the middle of the night.
Yes. He would have been visible to traffic during the day.
Yeah, the whole month of November,
Dworsky was with his-his son, you know, at-at the hospital.
and I have a better suspect.
who? - Well, canvassing the area for witnesses, the city cops heard about a woman matching Dr. Eames' description getting stabbed.
by whom?
Oh, a drug dealer who, uh, works a corner about a block and a half from where her remains were found.
guy is coming into the FBI.
I'm gonna question him in about a half an hour, if you want to be there when I question him.
Hey, I got news. - Oh, tell Bones.
so, remember the funky leaves?
I found concentrations of noscopine and papavarine in the root system.
opiates.
so maybe the victim was a drug addict.
Lauren was not a drug user.
okay. I mean, we can check the bone density test.
if you think it's necessary. I'm going to the FBI.
thank you.
I don't remember stabbing nobody.
okay, let me refresh your memory.
it was the same woman you killed six months ago and then buried under a tree.
okay, let's just be clear.
it's her we're talking about, right?
see?
booth, I told you, it's not her.
he's not shaking his head because it's not Lauren Eames.
he's shaking his head because he wants us to know he didn't do it.
but what he doesn't know is that we have a witness to the stabbing.
and Dr. Brennan here can tie you to the dead body through DNA, and a bunch of other scientific stuff.
you know what? This conversation
there's nothing in it for me, man, so...
okay, fine. We're done. I got you for murder.
it's been a long day. I'm tired. You want to go home? I'm tired.
Yes, I'm very tired.
okay, wait, wait, look!
look, I didn't stab her, man.
I gave her a poke to make her go away.
why was she even talking to you?
there's only one reason rich white people like you come to Woodland.
Oh, she was looking to score?
no. No, he's lying.
that's not possible.
look, man, I turned her down.
you turned down a sale?
she was negotiating price. I don't do that, man.
I gave her a little poke to motivate her home.
that was the last you saw her?
till you showed me that picture, yeah.
no, she had a T score over two.
an opiate-user would score a point eight, maximum.
ergo, Ipso-Facto, Colombo, Oreo, she didn't have a drug problem.
What?! That-that's not even Latin.
I mean, all your bone density test proves is that she wasn't a habitual drug user.
I don't like it when you two argue.
we're not arguing. - Yes, we are.
I'm saying that the victim wasn't a drug addict.
well, maybe someone shot her up with heroin before killing her.
Yes. See? Thanks for eavesdropping.
bones, why are you taking this so personally?
I mean, you're acting as though you're the one who's being accused of taking drugs.
temperance, are you all right?
Yes, of course.
I-I'm just tired.
I, um...I haven't slept in a couple of nights.
I apologize.
how did the opiates get into the tree?
Dr. Brennan?
well, it's good to get an insight into the victim, but I'm not certain that this line of inquiry leads directly to her murderer.
I...
I feel like it will.
okay.
it's a little weird that you said that, sweetie, but it's good.
good?
if I said something like that, she'd rip my head off.
can't we take a few minutes to delve here?
okay, all right, uh, only three factors affect tree growth
sun, water and soil nutrients.
nutrients, as in Lauren Eames.
well, there are multiple drug houses around that park.
maybe it was some kind of runoff?
even if every junkie in the neighborhood peed on that tree, it wouldn't be enough.
what if she was carrying?
Yeah, but if she was carrying, the dealer or the junkie that killed her would have taken the drugs.
not if he didn't know about them.
so then, the drug dealer didn't kill her.
you should test the clothing.
no. Why would a heart surgeon be carrying heroin?
maybe she loved a junkie.
you don't help a junkie by getting them drugs.
purple. It's heroin.
no. It could be morphine.
it would make more sense if she had morphine.
why would she buy heroin if she had access to morphine?
why did you buy heroin?
well, who were you buying it for?
is that who hit you over the head?
what makes you think I was struck over the head?
well, your skull is fractured.
there's more than one way for a head to get cracked.
you fell?
a slight compression fracture here on the C-4.
you fell with the full force of your weight onto your head.
you...you were thrown?
anything new?
it wasn't a weapon.
she was thrown bodily onto something approximately ten centimeters with a reflective surface.
by the power vested in me by the Jeffersonian Institution, I declare you sleep-deprived.
there's a cab waiting to take you home to bed, hmm?
do you really have that power?
I saw this lecture where this New Age guru type said the only power people exert over us is the power we allow them to exert.
that's incredibly stupid.
I agree. You wave a gun in my face, you got power, whether I like it or not.
how-how come I understand every word you say?
always?
I don't have that with anybody else.
sometimes I just hear...
noise.
well, I guess I've been here so long,
I speak the secret language of the Jeffersonian, huh?
come on, let's get you home.
so, I have some psychological insights into the victim.
okay.
Really? Well, oh...I didn't expect you to say yes.
um, I went over the victim's employment file, including the results of some psychological tests.
I don't see Lauren Eames going in for counseling.
no. It was mandatory.
after she lost a couple of young patients.
Dr. Lauren Eames was highly controlling.
now, that kind of mindset can be extremely difficult for someone who deals with death on a daily basis.
it was very stressful.
now, she dealt with the stress in two ways.
a She became logical to the extreme.
b She detached herself.
detached? - Yeah, emotionally.
she made herself not care.
okay, in order for her to stop feeling nothing, she began behaving erratically.
like picking fights with the drug dealer?
Yes, and eventually, she got what she wanted.
suicide by murder.
and I should accept your theory based on what?
over and over again, I've proven to you that I'm good at what I do.
so, please, explain to me how it is rational in any way for you to disregard what I say?
so now I'm the one behaving irrationally?
so that I can feel something? You-you want to stab me?
no.
Dr. Brennan, I consider you one of my closest friends.
you're not alone in this world.
it's one of the many ways you're different from Dr. Lauren Eames.
I-I...I need to go.
I will consider what you said.
Lauren wanted to be killed?
is it possible that she put herself into dangerous situations on purpose, out of despair?
Yeah.
sometimes she did this thing...
twice, we were flying hearts out for transplants.
once to Baltimore, once to Newark.
we didn't make it in time. The children died.
it upset Dr. Eames?
not that you could see.
I mean, she shrugged it off, but both times, once we got up in the air, she opened the door, she undid the seat belt, and then just kind of hung out, looked at me.
looked at you how?
like she was daring me to tip the helicopter and topple her out.
what did you do?
I tilted the other way, so she'd fall inside the aircraft.
God, I'd have been good for her.
she should have given me a chance.
should have given us the chance.
and you look at the way things turned out, what did she have to lose?
nothing.
she had nothing to lose.
she knew that.
it was her biggest regret.
thank you.
there's nothing left for me to discover from the hard evidence.
well, that's the whole problem with being an empiricist, right?
what is?
eventually, you run out of things to measure and smell and count.
no. There is such a thing as objective measurement, Micah.
there is such a thing as actual truth.
I heard one of these lectures about an experiment where they give guys a pair of glasses that make them see the whole world upside down.
but after three days, guess what?
they see everything right side up.
and then they take off their glasses, and they see everything upside down again.
for three days.
and then, eureka! Back to normal.
Yes, it takes the brain three days to adapt.
well, it seems to me you can't trust a brain that can't make up its mind about something as basic as which way is up.
what-what else did you learn in that lecture?
that there's no such thing as objectivity.
that we're all just interpreting signals from the universe and trying to make sense of them.
signals from the universe.
dim, shaky, weak, staticky, little signals that only hint at the complexity of a universe that we cannot begin to comprehend.
but that's what the lecture said, anyway.
Signals...From the universe.
Charlie Whaling, nine years old, presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage after automobile collision.
emergency HCT showed extensive damage around the aneurysm, which had thrombosed.
he rapidly deteriorated to the point of complete expressive aphasia and right hemiplegia.
whaling family has yet to update organ donation status.
Charlie Whaling was brain-dead.
you wanted his heart for Sam Dworsky.
where did Charlie's parents live?
1255B Franklin Street, in Woodland.
bones, what are you doing here? - What are you doing?
I don't know. Following you to a bad part of town and saving your life.
you know, the usual.
your turn.
Lauren came to Woodland to beg the family of a brain-dead boy to give his heart to Sam Dworsky.
so, what? They...
they were the ones that killed her?
no, Booth. No.
when Lauren was really disappointed or upset, it's like Sweets said.
she couldn't handle the intense emotion, so she'd do something dangerous.
right. Like coming here in the middle of the night?
I'm not her.
we're, we're not the same person at all.
it's just the universe turned upside down for three days.
what happened to her?
she bought the heroin for the danger of it.
to feel something.
she put it in her pocket.
she got hit by a car.
just like I almost did.
the impact explains the defensive wounds.
she struck her head over there.
so it was the driver that buried her in the park.
I can't prove any of this.
I know.
but do you still believe me?
Yeah.
of course I do. All right?
let me take you home. Come on.
maybe you just need a couple days off.
I'm all right now.
except I...
I made a mistake.
no. I told you my opinion. I mean, you got it right.
not everything.
she died with regrets.
come on, Bones. Everybody has regrets.
I heard her, you know?
Micah says that all we get are these...
dim, staticky messages from the universe.
who is this Micah guy?
the night watchman.
but he attends a lot of lectures.
anyway, the point is, she never gave him a chance.
Micah?
no. No. The helicopter pilot.
he offered himself to her, but she never gave him a chance.
that was her regret.
I got the signal, Booth.
I don't want to have any regrets.
I'm with someone.
and, uh, Hannah? She's not a consolation prize.
I love her.
you know, the last thing I want to do is hurt you, but those are the facts.
I understand.
I missed my chance.
my whole world turned upside down.
I can adjust.
I did.
Yes, you did.
do you want me to, uh, to call someone to be with you, or...?
no, I'm fine alone.
Thanks.
how'd it work out?
I listened to the universe.
I felt something.
I'm sad.
you hear that in a lecture?
I got my own story, Dr. Brennan.
just like you. Just like everybody.
I got my own sad story.
three days.
three days for the world to turn right side up again.
I-I really appreciate you talking toe, Agent Booth.
well, you know what? You're buying.
I just love Daisy so much. I just do. I just love her!
right. I know. You said it. We really should change the subject.
I can't. I can't! - Why can't you?
just... she's all I think about.
her laugh, her little nose, her cute laugh, the things she does in bed, so imaginative.
you really have too much to drink.
what about you?
I gotta listen to you, that's why.
finish all that.
you think I'm too young to get married?
Yeah, I do.
just like that? - Yeah, just like that.
you're too young.
but love and commitment don't have age restrictions.
Daisy's ready.
so? - So?
I can't imagine my life without her.
well, let's just talk about something else.
how about sports? How about those Capitals?
I want to get married.
how about action films? Let's talk action movies. Right?
I don't want to be your age and wind up like you.
What'd you say?
I don't.
you've never been married.
and that, that's sad to me. - What?
I don't want that to be where my life is headed, you know?
but I'm, I'm gonna propose to Daisy.
I'm gonna do it.
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
well, you know what? I'm gonna propose to Hannah.
What?!
I-I've been planning it for a while now.
Really? - Really.
Oh, my God!
you know, till death do us part. I'm picking out the ring tomorrow.
dude! That's great! Congratulaon!
we should, we should buy our rings together.
that's a good idea. Okay, yeah.
just don't go telling the world. I don't want to hear everyone's opinion.
no, no. It's, it's stuck in my shrink vault.
my drunk shrink vault. - Yeah, its.
Congratulations.
that's great news.
are you okay, Booth? You look a little pale.
I'm fine. You really don't have to yell, either. Okay?
I can hear you right here.
geez, it's so bright up here, isn't it?
I feel like I'm walking on the sun.
you're suffering from alcohol poisoning, aren't you?
poisoning? No.
excessive consumption of alcohol poisons the liver and depletes its supply of glutathione and other reductive detoxification agents.
okay, I got it.
I had a little bit too much to drink last night, all right?
okay! Lookit here! What happened to Mr. Mustard?
looks like he was stuffed in a Snuggly.
the remains have been completely devoured by mold.
an aggressive pathogenic mol.
decedent is male, early 20s, but the mold will have to be removed before
I can't discern anything else of value from the skeleton.
are you okay, Booth?
he's hung over.
on a school day? - Right.
was it a fun drunk or a hell-with-the-world drunk?
okay, look, I had a little bit too much to drink.
I was with Sweets. He wanted a little advice, that's all.
Ooh, about Daisy, I imagine.
I'd get soused, too.
Pliny the Elder thought eating fried canaries would alleviate a hangover.
canaries, right. I'll put that on my shopping list.
who found Captain Moldy here?
the owner of the building. Came up to fix the AC.
sweets must view your relationship with Hannah as being quite healthy, if he asked you for advice.
what happened over here?
it looks like something was dropped there.
we think the victim.
it's very unlikely that he fell out of the sky.
and there are drag marks from that damage to where we found the body.
indicating someone hid the body behind the air conditioner.
okay, so the victim was dropped here.
fallen angel? - You're not helping.
and someone dragged him over there.
presumably, the killer.
hide by the air conditioner and he took off over there through the exit down the stairs and off into the night.
only, he didn't use the stairs.
that door only opens from the inside, and it's alarmed.
there's no sign of it being tampered with.
then how did they get up here?
this is a phylogenetic mold.
Deuteromycota, I think.
it couldn't have originated on the roof.
it could help determine where he was before he was murdered.
fisher, you gonna be playing that all the time?
it's surf from a beach in Hana.
the doctor said the soothing sounds could help dispel my sense of dread and hopelessness.
Oh, also herbal tea helps.
and it's working?
other than more frequent trips to the bathroom, I'm chill.
why are we listening to the ocean?
it's relaxing.
please turn it off.
why are my bones not clean, Dr. Hodgins?
I have to determine exactly what I'm dealing with first.
then I'll know how to remove it without damaging the bones.
I did, uh, X-ray the remains, Dr. Brennan, and I marked the fractures.
there appear to be fractures on almost every bone.
these are at least two years old.
these are about one year old.
and these are all fresh and could possibly be cause of death.
I hope I got them all.
Yes.
I believe you did an excellent job with these, Mr. Fisher.
so who was our victim, a moldy crash test dummy?
well, usually I'm the one that removes the remaining flesh from the bones.
Yes, but in this case, the remaining flesh is mostly a fungus, which is my area of expertise.
okay, that won't mark the bone, will it?
no, it's nylon.
however, it's perfect for strangling.
are you just gonna stand there?
what the hell!
are you just gonna stand there?
I can't do anything until I can get my hands on the bones.
but don't worry about me.
I have my wave sounds.
Really? - Yes.
I'm making mold steaks, and you're listening to... You can't hear me anymore.
have you identified the mold?
you can't hear me, so I can say whatever I want, you morose bastard.
I can read lips.
how many bones are broken?
I can see evidence of approximately 120 remodeled breaks.
excuse me?
120 bone breaks that have already healed?
approximately.
I'm not done yet.
I hope that among all the antemortem fractures is some more current instance of bone damage that might suggest cause of death.
well, with all these fractures, we should be able to identify the victim through medical records.
I'll put out an all-points bulletin for a human pita.
Mr. Fisher, how long will Hodgins be with the bones?
why is he ignoring me?
Hodgins-- how long?
uh, if I take him literally, about eight hours.
fine, then you might as well begin cataloging the damage.
uh, I'm gonna need a pen and paper.
I have got some good news, some bad news and some more good news.
start with the good news.
the remains were devoured by a myxomycota mold from the protista kingdom, more commonly known as dog vomit slime mold.
that's the good news?
Yes, because the mold hitchhiked a ride to that rooftop on the victim.
and we might be able to use that to trace his movements.
the bad news is the condensation runoff from the AC, combined with heat from the exhaust vent created mold nirvana.
that mold is obscuring a lot of the evidence.
okay, good news, bad news.
looks like all we're left with is some more good news?
I got a little present for us in the mold.
the exoskeleton of a chimney swift bedbug.
bedbugs?
that's "more good news"?
Yeah!
tracking bedbug outbreaks?
there's an app for that.
you're really not gonna eat anything?
a hangover can inhibit appetite for up to 36 hours.
man, I leave town for one night and you get wasted.
what was the occasion, old Army buddy?
he was with Sweets.
did Sweets get drunk, too?
blind drunk. He hugged me.
you can get arrested for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
we just had a guy conversation.
a conversation about what?
nothing.
come on. What about?
Nah, nothing.
just, uh... Sweets and Daisy... moving forward, um...
you have an idealistic and highly romanticized notion of love.
sweets was right to confide in you.
What'd you say about me? - You?
Oh... nothing.
you were talking about love, and you didn't mention me?
can we just talk about the murder?
Angela, men are idiots.
I know that. And you've got one of the good ones.
you said when I worked up a likeness... - Thank God.
well, the facial bones were really damaged, so I did the best I could.
he looks pretty determined.
with all those broken bones, I'm figuring daredevil.
there you are.
I have been looking for you.
Oh, God. You're not gonna ruin a perfectly good snack by talking about bedbugs, are you?
if you want, I can call them "bunnies."
I'd appreciate that. Thank you.
right. Okay, so, there have been an outbreak of bedbug...
bunnies across the entire Eastern Seaboard.
but, luckily for us, the bed...bunny we found on the victim was a special chimney swift bedbunny.
okay.
three hotsheet motels along Lancing Avenue were especially hard hit.
by... bunnies?
Yeah, yeah. And mold.
Oh, the same dog slime mold that ate our victim?
dog vomit slime mold.
I'm just gonna finish this later.
I didn't name it.
anyway, anyway. The health department, right?
they sent a truck to pick up all the mattresses.
one of the motels said they had stacked the stuff outside and it all got stolen.
by a gang of BMX bike riders.
I'm assuming you've made some sort of connection?
tons of broken bones?
BMX bike riders?
and maybe they wanted something softer than concrete to land on.
a little dry.
good, though.
so, I told you that my sketch might-might not be exact.
well, then I'll describe the injuries and maybe a witness can help you with a new sketch.
am I supposed to just pretend to be an FBI agent?
becae what I'm wearing isn't very...
you know, Angela, just be urself.
go in strong. Be yourself.
excuse me. FBI Special Agent Booth. This here is Dr. Temperance Brennan.
and I'm Montenegro. Angela Montenegro.
Pete Casriel. What can I do for you?
are you missing anyone om this playground?
I beg your pardon? - Simple question.
do you have any kids who used to here all the time who aren't anymore?
it's not school.
we don't take tendance here.
no lip, Pete.
that too much? - Yeah.
show him the picture.
you recognize this guy?
he would have broken a lot of bones.
everyone around here, though, has a broken a bone or two, though. You know?
aren't you a little old to be subjecting your body to this kind of abuse?
I held the world record fothe longest ice pick grind for, like, two years when I was a young buc.
just got rightnto the blood.
right. I used to ride go-carts. But I grow out of it.
Yeah, well, that's you.
anyway, it's like The Condor once said.
you're gonna be woken up unconscious pretty on if you're going to have fun the way I like to have fun.
come check this out.
see that? That was a massive invert.
before he got it right, that kidroke his arm-- I don't know-- like, tree times.
okay, you know, I've seen enough of this.
excuse me, kid.
Hey, uh, excuse me. Hello? The guy sai "FBI."Hello?
everyone just...FBI. Hey, guys. Can, just...
bones, what are you doing? Bones? - Brennan.
stop!
what the hell, lady?
do you recognize this young man?
Yeah. Sure. That's D-Rott.
nice sketch, Ange.
that leg should be set.
you rely shouldn't try to stand.
I'm okay.
it's only broken a little bit.
a little bit?
does your mother know what you're doing out here?
what?
she's pregnant.
the FBI is weird, dude.
before they cart you off to the hospital, what can you tell us about D-Rott?
he wed out so many times that he was cut and broken and bruised so much that he looked like he was rotting.
hence the moniker.
does D-Rott have a real name?
he's pretty much the be rider in the area.
maybe the East Coast.
is he in trouble
no. He's dead.
Oh, my God.
that expins why he hasn't been around.
did Dustin do something crazy?
we found him on a warehouse rooftop in the Navy yards.
idiot.
shouldn't you at least prend to be upset?
Dustin was trying to get sponsored.
he'd been doing video stts over in the Navy yards, and he posted them online.
they're awesome.
he wanted to get a jumping from roof to roof, so I designed a map for him.
designing a ramp like that requires extensive knowledge of physics, geometry...
I'm a meanical engineering student at GW.
the design wasn't finished yet.
he never shouldhave used it.
well, we didn't find a ramp there.
there was someone with him on the roof. They moved his body. Any idea who that could have been?
no. He rod with a lot of people.
well, if you hear anything, just give me a call.
Whatre you guys gonna do with D-Rott's bike?
those wheels were sweet.
I'll pay whatever you want.
we didn't find his bike.
so some bastard probably killed him for his bike?
so listen up.
our child is not riding skateboards or bicycles or playing football until he is old enough to p his own medical bills.
it's okay if I don't take you serisly, isn't it?
are the hormones talking again?
screaming, actually.
well, I'm no throwing up for, like, moms just so this kid can break his leg or something.
noted.
ew and ew.
what are you doing, babe?
I am going to shake them through these filters until theyive me what I want.
you're getting that mad scientist look in your eyes.
I always wanted to be a mad scientist.
I live in a dream, Baby. Baby.
so what do you wt our kid to be, anyway?
I mean, if we could decide and make it happen without being those annoying parents?
anything I want?
anything.
a musician.
hard rock and 50s West Coast jazz, who's also an astrophysicist specializing in extraterrestrial studies, who also has a secondary degree, not necessarily a doctorate, in 20th-century political theory and its relaonship to corporatism.
who also does killer stand-up on the weekends.
what about you?
what do you want our baby to be?
Well,"mad scientist" sods good to me.
Hey, Noel.
this is awesome.
they're like birds that can ride bikes but thout all the wings and feathers.
Yeah,right.Give me that.
look, man. I'm real sorry.
sorry for what?
I'm not here for breaking into th... Never mind.
I'm Noel.
my eyes are red from allergies.
I'm Dr. Sweets.
Oh, cool. So you can write prescriptions?
listen, Noel. We need you to find a bike. We think it was stolen.
you sure this is a good idea? - Look, I've used Noel before.
you know, to tail people, to sniff things out.
if anyone can find that bike, it's Noel.
Yeah. My powers of observation are acute.
Yeah, I saw the, uh, stalking arrest on your rap sheet.
Look.Noel, we think that someone was killed for the bike.
this one.
it was last seen in t Navy yard.
all right. No problem.
I'll neea cell phone, a car, and $500 cash to get started.
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just drop t charges for whatever it is you stole?
what exactly did steal?
I don't know, but you stole something, right?
Yeah, I must have.
so we got a deal?
$50 bucks for mylaucoma medicine?
tell you what. Let me see the bike, and we'll talk .
all right. Deal. - Deal.
deal. Amazing.
have you cataloged the injuries Mr. Fisher?
Mr. Fisher?
I was trying to get your atttion, Mr. Fisher.
I'm so sorry.
I was on Hatang Sak Beach in Thailand.
you're of more use here.
Wh... What is that smell?
reishi tea.
it's calming, but makes me go, so...
show me what y've learned from the bones.
right. Two minutes. I'm just going to use the john.
I don't have the time. Now.
okay, but the tea and... and the sounds of the ocean...
Mr. Fisher, I have many interns to choose from.
right.
um... Okay. Uh... I think I may have found the cause of death.
I've separated the bones with perimortem breaks.
all the breaks here, from the C4 and below are anterior wedge fractures.
Yes. Uh, I'm just gonna cut tohe cse.
the victim died from internal decapitation.
blunt force trauma the chin, which snapped the neck and killed him.
that's it.
ver yood, Mr. Fisher.
perhaps the tea is working.
I assure you, it is.
I thought you said you had to go to the restroom.
thank you.
Hey, Noel. I got your call. What do you got for me?
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't know you were hungry. You want mine?
no, I don't want your hot dog. The bike.
Oh, right. That kid over there in the grey plaid shirt.
this is, like, my fourth foot.
I saw him shop lift down the street.
he took off on his bike.
it's sitting over there next to the garbage can.
Thanks. - Anytime.
except for the early mornings.
are you sure you don't want a bite?
come on.
dude!
that's got to be worth another $20.
$20?
Where's my dog?
these are eight fake IDs.
what I'm trying do here, Orlando, is try to figure out if you're just another shifty kid or a murderer.
sit down.
I didn't... I didn't murder anody.
okay, look.
look, I-I sell these things for a hundred bucks a piece, but-but murder?
no. That's not me.
right. So, where'd you get the bike?
I found it. - Found it?
you know it's worth two grand?
what all beat up like that?
Yeah, the owner of this bike is dead.
Oh, this is terrible.
you know a Dustin Rottenberg, A.K. A.D-Rott?
no, I don't know Dustin or D-Rott.
I found the bike.
where?
between two buildings at this industrial park in the Navy yards.
just lying there, all beat up and on the ground.
so I took it.
see that?
doesn't it feel good to tell the truth?
we want you to perform a postmortem on the bicycle.
it's just like a skeleton, Angela.
the oxidized scratches are analogous to remodeled bone breaks, indicating they happened quite some time ago.
any marks without oxidation will be considered the perimortem injuries.
we were thinking you could recreate the bike accident.
okay, I mean, maybe I could but why?
we will recreate whahappened to the human victim while you recreate what happened to his bicycle.
then we can see whether the internal decapitation was an accident or murder.
what's that? - What?
what's that?! - What's what?
that chunk there. Hey, hey.
you don't have to yell.
I was just on Nea Beach in Spain.
give me a second to reenter joyless reality.
that could be a number of things, man.
could be a fragment of schist, or perhaps the ossification an organic material such as...
it's bone.
are you sure?
I'm calm, I'm focused, I'm sure.
now, if you'll excuse me.
not cool, man.
I ran a number of scenarios on the victim's body to explain the injuries on the bones.
check this out.
why are you using toys?
I'm pregnant. I can't seem to pass a t store without going in it.
boy or girl, my kid likes.
I'm sure. How many variants are you using?
I matched the victim's injuries to each of the following possible scenarios.
landing on two tires, one tire, upside down, back tire, and even on its side.
how many injuries match the damage to the bicycle?
all of them but one.
which jury?
the inteal decapitation.
now, no matter how I position him.
the mandible remains uninjured.
and look where the bike ends up.
exactly where the boy said he found the bike.
exactly.
so our victim wasn't killed in the bicycle crash.
after he fell, someone struck him in his chin, severing is head from his neck.
that's what killed him.
so, I found clothing fragments, insect larvae, wood splinters and roofing paper.
and a few bone fragments I gave to Fisher to see if he can work his magic.
fisher has magic now?
sure. He gets it from the tea. It's a secret potion.
what's this?
Yeah, I'm not sure yet.
it's some kind of gllinters.
but there was broken glass on the roof.
the bone chip isn't bone.
it's a tooth.
it's really discolored.
well, teacycline does that.
Yes.
radiocarbon analysis shows the tooth comes from someone 23 or 24 years old.
our victim's only 20.
right. Which means the tooth could not have some from our victim, and since tetracycline is used to treat chronic acne, we're looking for a pocknarked 23-year-old with a missing tooth.
keep drinking that tea, Mr. Fisher.
I didn't done anything.
well, your medical records show that you use tetracycline for you acne.
but that messed up your teeth.
Hey, dude, at least I don't look like a pizza.
I'm thinking of getting those whitener strips.
you know, in case I get a sponsor so I look good in the magazine
you want a sponsorship, just like D-Rott?
we all do, dude.
why do you think we put up with all the abuse?
D-Rott was going after the sponsorship that you wanted.
that pissed you off.
what the hell are you saying?
here's what I'm thinking happened.
you two got in a fight over the sponsorship, and you killed him.
see, we found this on D-Rott.
it's your tooth.
he knocked it out.
funny.
cause he knocked my tooth out.
I cut him off on the half pipe.
he went after me, and we beat the crap out of each other.
a million people saw it.
he kept the tooth as a souvenir.
it was a joke between us.
look.
I've got one of his.
see?
Mr. Fisher.
Ah, okay.
we've determined th the mandible was struck on the right side, approximately 5. 6 centimeters from the condyle.
right?
but look at the fracture.
look like glass.
okay, good.
I thought the tea might be getting to me.
Hodgins also found slivers of glass in the mold.
it looks like a thread that must have been left by the weapon.
very observant. Mr. Fisher.
I find I can be quite productive when not being crushed by despair.
I'm glad we have a reason to tolerate your foul-smelling beverages.
take the thread to Dr. Hodgins.
we need to know wh struck the victim.
what do you expect? They're diamonds.
so, when you proposed last time, didn't you give her a ring?
Yeah, my grandmother's ring.
why don't you just give her that one again?
well, she had to swallow it when she was in Indonesia so it wouldn't get stolen.
well, did you ever get it back?
Yeah. Yeah, it just doesn't seem that romantic to propose with a ring that had to be fisd out of the toilet, you know?
it is kind of gross.
looking for an engagement ring, are we?
Yes. Yes, we are.
can see this tray? - Yes.
it's nice tray. - It is.
right?
I'd like something like this.
Oh, an excellent choice, sir.
you must be very much in love.
Yeah.
holy... smoke, Agent Booth, that's...
I was thinking something more along the lines of that one.
Really? - Yeah. Why?
is she pregnant? I mean, do you have to get mried?
no.
well, then, I wouldn't bother proposing.
not with a ring like that.
don't listen to her, Sweets.
you get whichever ring that you want.
No,she's right. - I really am.
do you mind?
I'm ju saying, there's no returns, no exchanges.
no, no. No, nah. I can't. Sorry. Can't do it. Can't do it.
I... If I'm thiing about the money, then I can't ask her to marry me. Right?
you were right.
I... I'm not ready.
I'm-I'm years away from being in your situation.
look, I don't care what you do, all right?
I'm going for it. I love Hannah. And I'm getting her... this one.
that's bigger than the last one.
you're a wonderful man.
a wonderful, wonderful man.
I'm quite moved, myself.
I use your design, and calculated every conceivable way that he could have gotten enough speed to cause the damage to the roof, but it doesn't match.
Oh, God.
what?
he didn't use that ramp.
it wasn't a jump from building to building.
well, yeah, but he didn't drop from the sky.
basically, he did.
this is my fault.
he tried to use my other design.
no, Staci.
Dustin wasn't killed by the stunt.
his body was dragged to where he was found after he was killed.
you sure?
how do you think he got up there?
he made the jump from the ground.
he launched himself over 40 feet in e air?
I didn't think it was possible.
I told Dustin the design was only thretical.
I did it for class, and the teacher flunked me.
do you think that you can draw the design for me?
sure.
well, the-the ra is on the ground.
he had to be going at least 40 miles an hour when he hit it to get enough heht, see?
Yeah, but nobodyan get that kind of speed on a bike. I mean, not that street.
I know. Someone had to tow him to get a launch like that.
and whoever it was would have been the last person to see him alive.
Thisras based CIII new ramp design.
so, it could have been anyone with him that day.
anyone with a car that can go 40 miles an hour.
well, that rules out Henry Ford.
but whoever struck him left behind the threads of glass.
now, this is the glass thread we found in e victim's fractured mandible, and this... this is the thread found in the mold.
same magnification?
exactly.
so they match? - They match.
good. Whatind of glass leaves threads like this?
fiberglass.
the kind of spun fiberglass ed in casts.
so, the rder weapon was a cast?
when I was in that BMX park, it seemed li everybody there had a cast on hisrm.
what do we do? Take samples from every broken arm we can find?
wait a minute.
we're not looking for a broken arm.
what do you mean?
he was struck in the chin by a blow that was strong enough to cause internal decapition.
he was kicked.
he was totally kicked in the chin.
how many broken legs did you see?
just one.
so, forensics found these fiberglass fibers on the body.
so?
so they're reants from your cast.
I'll be damned.
well, we hung out together, so it's probably why, right?
Yeah, but Dustin Rottenberg's DNA was also found on your cast.
what does that tell you?
you kicked him.
is-is there... is there any chance that it wasn't my kick that killed him?
like, maybe it washe accident, dude.
I don't know. You know, you can discuss that strategy with your defense lawyers.
far as I'm concerned, Dr. Brennan says you're the one who killed him.
I was really hoping otherwise, bro.
why did you kick him in the head?
I don't know. I was just...
I was so amped up, man, from the stunt.
I mean, if this thing had woed, bro, it was gonna be epic, I mean, historic.
you should have seen how fast he was going when he hit that ramp, dude.
you towed him?
Yeah, man, in my van.
and you know what? It was perfect.
I saw it ithe mirror. I saw the-the bike head for the stars, man, like a rocket, just... Like the space shuttle, right?
it was beautiful.
but then when D-Rott didn't pop over that roof and wave he was okay, I knew he wasn't okay.
so took the rope ladder and climbed up.
he was so messed up, man.
there was no sign of his bike anywhere.
Yeah, well, my people said that he hit the roof with the equivalent force of falling out of a two-story building.
I know. Heas so pissed.
I leaned down to s if he was all right.
the dude hit me.
and we just started getting into it or whatever.
you fought?
he had a grip on my plums, man.
what was I supposed to do?
I just... I kicked out.
you kicked him ithe jaw.
he had a grip on mplums, man.
it has an effect on your judgment.
I wish... Man, I-I wish he wouldt have died, though.
Hey, soldier.
you looking for a good time?
look at you!
you didn't answer the question.
ll... I, um...
I-I thought I was looking fun, but u know, the truth is, I,um...
I think I'm looking for a little bit more.
well, don't underestimate a good time.
I, uh... I was gonna... You know what?
I was gonna wait, but... I, um... I love you, Hannah.
and I just... When I met you, I really, honestly wondered
Seeley. Oh, my God.
I, uh... Marry me.
I want you to be my wife.
I... Oh, Seeley.
I love you.
I really do... But I can't.
I'm just not the marrying kind.
I am. - I know you are. I know.
I thought we would have more.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
so happens now?
what do u think happens now?
now... Can we just go back?
I'll walk in here, you tell me how good I look,
I'll say thank you, we kiss, we'll have a nice dinner like...like this never happened.
we can just...go back.
okay.
your turn.
what happens now?
I'll get my stuff out of your place.
W much time do you need?
to get out of your place?
or to get over you?
I do love you, Seeley.
I don't think we're done, but I can see we're done for now.
I'm just not the marrying kind.
you already said that.
I've said it plenty of times before.
I guess you weren't listening.
you drunk?
relatively.
relatively, I'm drunk, meaning, I'm drunker than usual. But no... I am not a drunk.
you sound... something
Hannah called me.
just...
really, I-I... I don't want to talk about that, okay?
I'm just... I'm over... I'm over it.
I'm done, okay?
so... what happens next?
what happens next?
What...?
I mean, you like evidence, right, Bones?
well, here's the evidence.
the evidence is that there is something wrong here.
now, I... I fell in love with a woman, and I had a kid.
she doesn't want to marry me.
well, uh... And then, the next woman-- well, she's...
me.
Yeah, and now... I mean, what is it with women who just don't want what I'm offering here?
booth... - No. Just...
you know what? Drink. Drink.
I'm just really... I'm just mad.
I'm just really mad at all of you. All right? I'm just mad.
okay, so... You want to kn how this is gonna work?
okay, this is how this is gonna work.
me and you are partners.
that's what we do. We're partners. All right?
and I love that. I think that's great.
and, uh, we -'re good people who catch bad people, right?
Yeah, and-and... and we argue, we-we go back and forth.
we're partners.
and sometimes after we solve a case, we come here, and we celebrate.
that's what we do. We celebrate.
so, as far as I can see, that is what happens next.
are you okay with that?
great, because, you know, if you are, tell you what.
you stay here and you have a drink with me.
all right, maybe, uh, we have a little small talk, chitchat.
and if you're not, well.
you can leave.
there's the door.
and tomorrow I'll find you a new FBI guy.
choose are my only choices?
Yeah. Those are your only choices.
then I'll have a drink.
look, I don't understand.
how does an ice storm, followed by a snowstorm, qualify as global warming?
no, the term is not "global warming," it's "climate change.
if I can interrupt... - If you're going to take my side.
I'm not taking sides. - Then, no.
okay, here are the facts, Bones: Sometimes it's hot, sometimes it's cold.
okay, seriously, guys, I really think that we need to talk about your partnership.
okay, is that why you decided to join us?
no. Answer's no. No.
DC Medical Examiner brought in remains found just south of an I-295 overpass.
location suggests a murder dump.
why didn't they let us inspect the crime scene? That's very irritating.
no way.
cause, if they waited another 15 minutes, the body would have been covered by snow, and any evidence would have been compromised.
Oh, no way!
I know it's early, but the radio says this might turn into a blizzard, so I was thinking we could work on the case for a couple of hours, and then leave early before traffic gets crazy.
okay, I'm on my way.
there's a body at the lab. I should go.
Wait-wait... wait a second. Wait just a...
they're leaving them on the curb. Jackpot!
stadium seats. - But they're not just stadium seats, all right?
they're from the Vet. They're from the Vet? You know? Veterans Stadium?
fly, Eagles, fly ? on the road to victory. Ah-ah-ah!
come on, Bones, please, they're from the Vet!
all right, look, I will pay for breakfast. Yes.
so you guys can help me take those seats back to my apartment.
uh, didn't you hear what I said? There's a body.
which will still be dead if we get there 15 minutes late.
come on, Bones, please. They're from the Vet.
okay, will you agree to find another time to talk?
Yeah. Sure. No problems. Bones, please.
look, 15 minutes. Just 15 minutes.
15 minutes.
we've got the place to ourselves.
Jeffersonian is officially closed on account of the storm.
nothing like murder to ruin a snow day.
what do we got? - Female victim.
decomp puts time of death approximately 12 days ago.
there's a lot of blood on the clothes.
pubic symphysis suggests the victim was in her late 20s or early 30s.
this is weird. It's a tick.
I don't even recognize the species.
holy cow.
I heard that. - Oh, no, no, no, no.
it was, um... It was an exclamation of admiration.
I wasn't actually... - You can stop now.
save yourself. - ...commenting on your size.
how was the doctor's appointment?
it was fine.
uh, Cam said you need a facial reconstruction.
right, yeah. Plus we found a dead cell phone in the victim's pocket.
okay. Uh, I'll take a look, see if I can figure out a way to get some information.
Hey. Let's go talk.
you didn't tell us the frame was made of cast iron.
this is taking a lot longer than you said it would. They need me at the lab.
okay, look. Two minutes, that's all I need. Two minutes.
pull, pull, pull.
that's it. Right there. Aah! Easy! Ah, that hit my foot.
everything is fine, Angela. It really is.
you know, when you find out that you're a carrier and you have a child inside, it's kind of...
I know. I know. I know.
but the doctor told us it doesn't mean a thing unless I'm an LCA carrier, too, right?
right. - Right. Yeah, good.
so, we wait for my results.
and until then, you got to remember, there is a very, very small chance that I'm a carrier.
all right. You're right.
I just love this baby so much already.
me, too. But the baby is fine.
will you please tell your mama,"Don't worry"?
you realize that's pointless advice to give a mother, right?
Yes. But come on-- wouldn't you hate it if we didn't reassure you?
Yes, I would.
Oh... go ahead. Back to your tick.
we're good?- Yeah. We're-we're good.
okay. We're good.
uncontrolled bleeding from wound site, severe nosebleeds...
Oh, no. Not good.
it's still sticking out.
we got it. Just, you push. We'll pull.
okay. Well, I'm going to let go. It's wedged too tight to fall anyway.
okay. Cam... I'm sorry. I'll be there soon.
the victim had Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever when she died.
the tick was a Hyalomma impeltatum. That's how the victim was infected.
was that cause of death? - No. She was strangled.
I found perimortem fracture lines on the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae.
has the lab been quarantined?
not necessary. Testing revealed viral antibodies, but no active virions.
good, good. Wait. But how was the victim strangled?
the killer used his hands, and...oh, no.
the victim may have coughed aerosolized blood into the killer's face, infecting him with the virus.
and since the virus has a ten- to 12-day incubation period and the murder occurred almost two weeks ago, that means the killer...
is now contagious.
okay. The door is shut. You hit the button. I'll meet you upstairs. - All right.
booth, I have to get back to the lab right away.
the victim was suffering from hemorrhagic fever, and the killer is probably infected.
well, we'll get there soon.
we'll get these seats off, and before you know it, we'll be back at the lab.
the lights went out. It must be the blizzard.
cam, I'm in Booth's elevator, and we may have lost power.
I heard there were outages all over town.
the lab's lost power, too. It's got to be the storm.
Dr. Brennan, can you hear me? - I can't hear you, Cam.
Are...Great.
is this fever thing bad?
we have to find the killer before he spreads the disease.
the city may be on the verge of a deadly viral outbreak.
and we're trapped in here?
Sweets! Sweets!
okay, thanks for the update, Cam.
you're emergency services. This is an emergency.
we're trapped in an elevator. There's two of us.
if you could just send...No, no, no. Nobody's hurt, but listen.
okay, there is a killer virus out there that only we can stop.
so just get someone here now or...
Hello?
you got to be kidding me. He hung up on me. He didn't believe me.
cam spoke to the Centers for Disease Control in Georgia.
there have been no other reported cases of CCHF.
so that's good. - Only if we catch the killer in time.
he's the one who can spread the disease.
Hey, guys. You okay?
what's with the hat?- Your next-door neighbor's home.
Mrs. Ross? - Yeah.
she is a very friendly woman.
she gave me a bunch of stuff in case you guys get cold.
Oh, and here-- for light.
No! - Sweets!
move! - What? It's a menorah.
do you know what would have happened to your arm if the elevator started moving again?
extensive trauma to your radius and ulna, perhaps even spontaneous amputation.
I feel a little sick.
no way to transport the remains to another lab.
couldn't even get the garage open.
then, we'll have to make the best of it.
okay. Now, the onset of this disease is very sudden.
initial signs are headaches, high fever.
symptoms rapidly progress to include severe bruising and uncontrolled bleeding.
are you sure that we're not in any danger of getting sick?
Absolutely.
all right. This is a map from the Cold War exhibit.
so ignore the fact that there's still a Soviet Union and a Czechoslovakia.
crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever, or CCHF, appears pretty much everywhere I've shaded on this map.
okay, so not North America?
so you think that the victim was a foreigner?
the discriminant functions of the cranial measurements suggest that she was at least part Native American.
okay, so she was a traveler.
once you finish her facial reconstruction, we can try to match her through Passport Control.
if the office is open.
well, it's difficult to see detail in such a small scale, but I-I concur with your cause of death.
we still don't have power, so I can't do X-rays.
should I go ahead and clean the bones? - No, no.
go to my office and look through back issues of Medicinal Physics Quarterly.
there should be a stack of them near my iguana.
what am I looking for?
I remember an article about electrostatics and triboluminescence.
you can take X-rays without electricity.
I'm on it.
electricity from cellophane tape?
according to Dr. Brennan's article, you create a vacuum inside the glove box, then pull back the tape.
and this will release electrical currents strong enough to generate X-rays?
theoretically. Straight through to the film underneath.
the X-ray goes through the bone, onto the photo paper.
voil?
I'm going to believe it when I see it.
all right.
that's kind of awesome.
all right. Take this table away. - Okay.
let's see here. Start pulling these out. - All right.
dude. - I know.
okay.
there's no match for the victim in Missing Persons or Passport Control.
what? - I blame you.
what? You blame me for what? For the no match or the blizzard?
they're chairs, Booth. They're just a bunch of chairs.
they're history. They're from the Vet, okay?
and secondly, I'm gonna get us out of here.
you have a plan? - That's right. I have a plan. Escape hatch.
great! I'll climb up and get it open.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm the climber. You're the thinker.
no. I'll be able to fit through the gap much easier.
here. - Bones, just let me do the climbing.
kneel down. I'll show you.
Oh, hello!
uh... do you want to get on my shoulders?
hey guys, Mrs. Ross sent some snacks. Hello.
Hello...? Why is everyone saying "hello"?
uh... I'm sorry. Should I...Is this a bad...?
Hello? She wants to sit on my shoulders.
traditionally, people do that the other way around.
I'm merely demonstrating that the widest part of me is narrower than the widest part of Booth. See?
all right. - Wow. Okay.
comparing body parts. What else do you do during a blizzard, right?
okay, I got the idea, Bones. Thank you.
Seriously?
the only records you have of test results are on computer?
I mean, didn't somebody jot them down somewhere?
okay, listen, I need my test results, okay?
because my poor wife-- she's going crazy here, you know, waiting for...
Yeah.
okay, thanks.
you probably heard that.
not if you didn't want me to.
it's just, it's a pregnancy thing. It's nothing to worry about.
you'll tell me if there's anything I can do.
whoa. Look at this.
significant remodeling trauma to this femur.
looks like there's stuff embedded in the bone.
huh. All right. Just be careful, all right? Your foot's on the edge.
I'm fine. Got it. - All right.
Oh, it's open!
No! - What "Oh, no"?
these stupid chairs. It won't open all the way. - Just be careful, Bones.
Oh, wait, my phone's ringing. - Just be careful.
what do you mean, your phone is ringing? You're actually going to take a phone call now?
well, it could be the lab. Oh, shoot! - Whoa, okay.
I'm going to get the phone. No one move.
Oh, Dr. Brennan, careful. Your foot.
Oh, God! Are you guys all right?
Oh. I'm okay. Booth?
don't touch me. It's my back, my back!
don't touch me.
I-I'm trying...
Oh! Where's Sweets with those painkillers?
maybe Mrs. Ross didn't have any.
she's been singing in the hallways for a week after her dental surgery.
trust me, she has painkillers.
the victim had foreign objects embedded in her left femur.
remodeling suggests they'd been there for at least four years.
Ow! Shrapnel.
Yes, the random placement would suggest an explosion.
how did you know that?
army buddy of mine spent a few months in a hospital after an IED explosion.
I saw his X-rays.
so, the victim was probably around an explosion four years ago.
but if we can figure out where and what the explosion was, it might help us to get closer to an I. D.
you got to look at the shrapnel itself. That's going to tell you...
Ow! Sweets! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you. I got you.
so, I got you some, uh, aspirin.
aspirin? I need painkillers!
Oh! What, is she holding out?
huh? Is she going to some kind of a rave?
a bottle of water. - Water?
ow, water. - And a... bag of frozen peas.
all right, pal, you know what? I'm not cooking dinner. I need something for the pain!
no, no. It's to ice your back.
Oh, it's cold, cold.
it's cold. It's cold.
but, actually, that feels pretty good.
Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah, right there.
the metal is melted.
I have no idea what it was.
Hey, does that look like some sort of pattern to you?
like, ridging around what used to be the edges?
Yeah. Kind of looks like money.
coins.
well, that would be consistent with what Agent Booth said about IEDs
you know, that they're filled with whatever bits of metal are available.
okay, so if you live in a country whose currency is worthless...
not uncommon in a war zone.
I have no idea what that is or why it excites you.
there's a Global Cultures section of the Jeffersonian.
there's this-this Coins of the World exhibit.
so, I'll figure out the composition of the shrapnel, and then compare it to the coins that are in the exhibit.
Ooh, fantastic!
and how exactly do you plan to do that without electricity?
it's funny how fate intervenes sometimes, huh?
there's no such thing as fate. - And this is not funny.
just let me make my point.
since you find yourselves here... - Trapped.
you could look at it that way, or you could look at it as an opportunity.
sweets, just stop shrinking around the bush, okay?
just say what it is you want to say. Go ahead.
what do you think of, uh, resuming therapy just for a month or two?
what? - Why?
no. Forget about why. No, that's not going to happen.
and why would you bring that up now?
let's be honest. A lot has happened in the last few months.
now, I know that Hannah's presence has stirred up a lot of feelings between you...
stop! Right there. - I agree.
no. Because I care about you. About both of you.
you know what? Stop, or I'll hit you with the frozen peas.
I know that you have been forthcoming about your feelings for each other in the past.
and the past is the past.
but as a couple... - No, Booth and I are not a couple.
I understand. I'm just saying that... - Stop! Just stop.
all right, listen to my words. It is over!
agent Booth, I just think that...
don't ever mention Hannah again. You understand?
perhaps you'd like to take a walk? - Sure.
what is that smell?
well, I can't use the exhaust system without electricity, so I thought it'd be better to, uh, clean the bones out here where there's more air flow.
Oh, my God. You're boiling body parts?
this is how it's done. You know that.
no, no. I mean, I was getting kind of getting hungry, and I thought that you were...
Oh, my God!
you're pregnant. The smell of boiling flesh makes you want a sandwich.
success!
what did you get?
I got the Coins of the World, plus, an emission spectrograph from the instrument archive.
to I. D. the shrapnel? - Yeah.
now I just... I just need a short burst of electricity to create a carbon spark to basically vaporize a sample of the metal.
where are you going to get the electricity?
well, as well as a dynamite igniter from the late 1800s, huh?
I got all this from the American History wing.
Brennan. - I'm sending you a photo.
now that the bones are clean, I can see evidence of perimortem injuries to the cortical surfaces of the right ulna and radius.
they're difficult to see clearly enough to ascertain their exact nature.
I agree, but since we can't use the Medio-Cam...
you have to do a penetrant test.
I'm not familiar with that.
soak the bones in a liquid dye.
the dye will permeate the compromised surfaces, increasing the contrast.
so that the injuries will become clear. Brilliant.
Yes. I-I know.
I can't just sit here. I'm just gonna try to move the chairs again.
booth! Your back. - All right, I'm fine.
are you happy now? - Yeah, it's useless.
maybe you should think of a way to get electricity that doesn't involve rare historical items worth upwards of $50, 000.
Yeah, I'll just blame Wendell. - Yeah, that's good.
how's it going with the victim's cell phone?
well, the battery's dead, plus the wiring is totally corroded, but I was able to save the SIM card, so if I can put it in someone else's phone,
I might be able to find out who she called last, and they might be able to lead us to the killer.
what are you doing?
I told you. I'm going to use the SIM card... - Yeah, but no, you can't.
Ange, you can't take my phone. I need... You know, I need my phone.
I need my... - Why? There's...
you're worried about the test results, aren't you?
no. I'm not. I'm not. I just, you know...
I don't... I don't, uh, want to miss their calls, so...
honey, it's me. You're scared, too. I can tell.
even if we both test positive, Angela, there's still only a 25% chance - that the baby would be... - Be blind.
and that leaves 75% chance that everything would be fine.
and you know what? I like those odds.
right. Okay.
well, I think Cam has the same cell phone as you, anyway.
this is all the dye I could find. - Let's see.
that should do the trick. Just pour it in here. Right.
excuse me? - Yeah.
what's with the get-up?
well, I need electricity for the emission spectrograph, so I'm going to tap into this emergency light up here.
uh, are you sure that's safe?
Yes, dude. I made my own safety harness.
Oh, man, he's lost his mind.
if I can just detach this battery... - Are you sure you know what you're doing?
of course I know what I'm doing. I just need to...
Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no. Hodgins, no!
Oh, look out! Look out! - Hodgins!
Oh, my bad. Sorry. Sorry.
okay. Sorry.
I'm sorry. - Don't worry. He'll clean it up.
what if you had gotten hurt? In this blizzard!
wait a minute. You're mad because you're worried about our safety?
Wow. Thank you.
that was the last of our dye.
okay, now I kind of wish you'd gotten hurt.
Hey, what about your beetles?
excuse me?
nothing. - Oh, no, Mr. Bray.
we're way past nothing. What's with the beetles?
well, Egyptians used to grind up their shells to dye textiles.
Yeah, they also used slave labor. It doesn't make it right.
Dr. Hodgins, killer virus, untold casualties.
therefore, it is unlikely the angle of the emergency panel will ever be sufficient for egress.
okay, okay. I get it, all right? I get it.
stupid chairs. You're right. The whole thing is just ridiculous. Stupid idea.
just, uh... - What?
tuesday, October 21, 1980. Game six of the World Series.
that sounds very important.
Yeah. Pete Rose, Manny Trillo, Mike Schmidt, Steve Carlton.
tug McGraw strikes out Willie Wilson at 11: 29 p. m. Phillies win.
and these seats were there, and... you're sentimental about it.
my dad and I were there.
he quit drinking.
for about two weeks.
long enough to remember that I was his kid.
best day of my life.
so did you think that you could reclaim a part of that day?
it's just history.
that's all. It was our one perfect day.
are you feeling bad about being hard on Sweets?
no. I'm thinking about my dad.
and about being hard on Sweets.
you think he was right? Should we discuss us?
Yeah. Yeah, I think we should.
now?
no. - Yeah
Hey. You all right?
nickel. Coins are part nickel.
phone call?
from the doctor?
dissolved one of the coins in hydrochloric acid.
now I'm, uh... I'm testing the solution.
I-I just... I should have thought of this earlier.
what did the doctor say? - Leber congenital amaurosis.
it's a genetic disease. It's recessive. Causes blindness.
and you're a carrier?
usually, both parents... - Yeah, Angela's a carrier, too.
copper. Shrapnel coins are bimetallic, with an aluminum-bronze center and a cupronickel-zinc ring.
I got to... I got to tell Angela. She's going to hate me.
Hodgins, she's not going to hate you.
rubles. Uh, Russian rubles.
that's the... that's the only coin that... that matches.
she's not going to hate you. She loves you.
you guys are solid. You can get through this.
you hear that something has a one in a thousand chance or one in 10, 000.
but I guess it's like the lottery, right?
somebody always wins, you know.
that sounds like good news.
I'll give you the room.
Rubles-- Wendell says the shrapnel in the victim's leg was rubles.
rubles? Wait a second. Four years ago-- that-- Chechnya.
that's right, the separatists would sometimes use Russian coins in their IEDs as further protest because the rebels wanted their own currency.
all right, look, if an American civilian was injured by an IED in Chechnya, there'd definitely be press coverage.
so we scan the news outlets for an American who was blown up in Chechnya four years ago.
can I interrupt? - Oh, yeah, of course.
did you need this again? I finished my call with Dr. Brennan.
no, I already checked yours out.
it seems like none of our cell phones match the victim's SIM card.
so the victim's phone is totally shot?
I was able to repair some of the corroded wiring, but I'm just afraid that if I plug the phone into a regular alkaline battery, that it'll short.
so what you need is a way to provide power gradually.
Yeah, exactly.
you perform miracles? - Hope so.
where are you going? - To break into the cafeteria.
okay. Okay.
microfiche of old newspapers from the Jeffersonian Library.
I thought they'd all be digital. - Luckily not, for us.
but can you figure out a way to skim through the microfiche?
Yeah, sure, if you just tell me what I'm looking for.
look, I've already tried that. It's a hydraulic, old-school. It's a single cage-style door.
how you guys doing?
Booth's on the phone with the fire department.
it's the maintenance department. - Maintenance department.
okay, great, thanks.
world's Greatest Grandpa?
Yeah, uh, Mrs. Ross gave it to me. It's a lot comfier than my jacket.
you do realize that Mr. Ross is dead, right?
I mean, don't you find it odd that Mrs. Ross is dressing you up in her dead husband's clothes?
booth needs to say something to you. - No, he doesn't.
Yeah, right, about earlier. Look, I'm sorry.
it's okay. - Thanks.
what? What's okay?
booth didn't say anything. - We're guys.
everything's fine now, Dr. Brennan.
I maybe found our victim.
four innocent bystanders,"including an American aid worker, were injured "when an IED struck a vehicle in Beslan on Tuesday.
aid worker makes sense.
the American has been identified "as Anne-Marie Weston, age 28, "a field worker with the Alliance for Human Dignity.
ms. Weston almost lost a leg, but doctors now expect her to make a full recovery.
it's all consistent: the age of the victim, the location of the injury.
hang on, I'm going to send you a photo here.
looks like we found our victim.
the directoror of Allianance for Human Dignity confirmed Anne-Marie's identity.
was she still working for them?
not in Chechnya.
he said she spent most of the past year traveling back and forth from Albania.
well, that would explain how she got the virus.
there was a recent outbreak or CCHF in rural Albania.
the director is going to pull the file and get back to me, but my phone is running out of battery.
you can use my...Oh, sorry, it's Wendell.
Yes.
give me the number.
my phone doesn't get much service here, but I'll go outside and make the call.
in a blizzard?
Yeah, nothing's keeping me in here except helping Mrs. Ross and her 40-year-old daughter figure out how to talk to each other without arguing.
all right, here you go. Thanks.
thank you. - Right.
I sent pictures of the injuries. Your penetrant test worked.
there appear to be two distinct types of injuries.
that's what it looks like to me, too. Irregular scratches scattered all over the surface...
as well as a number of deep, linear gouges...
which almost seem like they're regularly spaced, like a pattern.
what would cause this?
the scratches are consistent with broken glass, as if the victim's arm went through a window, but the gouges...
how about, like, security glass?
what, like in prisons?
right, a window with thick wire mesh that would be embedded in the pane.
that would be consistent with the injuries.
Wendell, wh... why am I looking at hundreds of pounds of potatoes?
got to go. I'll call you when we have something else.
you said you wanted a miracle.
so this is why you broke into the cafeteria? - Yep.
I learned how to do this in grade school. I won my science fair.
Oh, my God. You were that kid.
meaning what?- The show-off.
and this is how you thank me?- Spud-tastic.
this is for the victim's cell phone?
Yeah, I'm connecting groups of potatoes in series to increase voltage.
then we can connect these potatoes together in parallel to increase amperage.
Spud-sational, totally spud-tacular. Can I help?
if you stop making spud jokes.
sorry. My sincerest "potatologies.
that feels great.
Ah, it's like you're untying the knots.
it's Thai massage.
it combines deep tissue with acupressure. It's quite effective.
Yeah, I can feel that... We should stop, you know, because...before Sweets comes back.
Why?
well... - Oh, I understand.
you think he'll interpret our physical contact as yet another sign that we...
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, but... I got to tell you, my back feels-- wow-- so much better. Thanks.
no problem.
Yeah, you know, I can see how Sweets could get confused.
we both did tell him how we felt about each other.
in the past. - In the past.
and... we both thought about it; he knows that.
it? - Sleeping together.
it would be odd if we didn't.
right, uh, so we're talking about this now?
we seem to be.
I always assumed that we'd be very compatible. Didn't you?
well, yeah.
because we're both so physical.
right, the way we throw ourselves into a case.
we both have excellent stamina.
making love would be quite satisfying.
Yeah.
but then what?
I mean, as a couple, me and you would never... - No, it wouldn't work.
Oh, it's so cold!
okay, so I, uh...I talked to the director of the Alliance for Human Dignity, and our victim went to Albania to investigate charges that girls were promised dream jobs in the U. S.and were never heard from again.
human trafficking. - Yeah.
and back here, she went to neighborhoods with a heavy Albanian population and visited businesses that she thought might be covers, always slipping young women her number, telling them to call her if they need any help.
right, they're sold into prostitution.
it's a big business here in DC, and the people that make the profit are brutal.
how about now? - No, it's still not working.
well, we can always use them for fries.
Oh, my gosh! Wait a minute! Wait! It's working! It's working!
okay, okay, uh, call history is 5342.
we are losing power. - What?! How?!
losing power! Come on! - That's not possible.
this should work for a few hours, guys.
more potatoes! More potatoes!
you won the science fair, Wendell! Do something!
fast, Hodgins! Come on! More potatoes! Come on! Move quicker! Move quicker!
hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
Wendell, be careful!
Where's the other one? - Where?
move, move, move, Wendell, Wendell! I got one. I got one.
you guys, the phone! - Potatoes over here!
potatoes.
give me another one. Give me another one.
you guys, the phone. The phone is dying. More potatoes!
potatoes! Move, move, move!
guys, get on it!
I have no wires. There's no more. There's no more. - One right there! Use it!
come on! More potatoes! Come on, come on, come on!
I don't have enough power. - Okay, we got it! We got it!
the phone, it's...
sorry.
...dead.
an victim's phone history was only incoming calls.
that seems unusual.
unless that was the number that she gave to women who might need help.
right, it could have been a dedicated line.
were there any calls near time of death?
one from a building, uh, near the corner of Hill and 27th.
is the FBI going to send anyone?
can't yet. Not until the roads are open.
hill and 27th is less than a mile away.
that's great. With us in here, it might as well be 100.
there might actually be a way out of here, but you're not going to like it.
the bolts between the first and second seats are rusted.
if we apply sufficient force with whatever combination of kicking or pulling or jumping...
we can break these apart.
Yes. But I know how important they are.
let's do it. On three.
Really? Are you sure? Your back.
we go on three. - Wait, wait, wait.
on three, or one, two, three, and then go-- which is more common?
I-I don't know. It's up to you.
well, on three would be quicker.
not anymore.
all right.
okay, you set? - Yeah.
on three. You ready?
one, two...
use your legs for power, not your back.
okay. One, two...
Yeah! All right! After you. - Why, thank you.
uh, well, go easy if you're going to get...Aah! Easy!
all right? Yeah. That's got to be the address. - Okay.
booth. Security glass.
the spacing of the wires is consistent with the gouges on the victim's arm.
look here.
she's the one that broke that window?
that's a reasonable conclusion. Was she trying to get in or out?
it's all right. I'm a federal officer.
it's going to be okay. You understand? FBI.
what you doing? Go away!
okay. FBI, Boris. Who are you? - Not Boris.
booth, he...he could have the virus.
look, you could be very sick. We got to get you to the hospital. Listen to me, Boris.
not Boris!
boris is a Russian name-- Albanians hate Russians.
I got that, Bones. You know, I'm just trying...
wait, ho-ho-ho, easy!- Be careful, Booth-- he could be infected.
do you really want to do this?
hold it! Oh! Wait!
no, don't touch him, Booth! Don't touch him!
Seriously? No, but seriously.
his name is Tariq Grazdani, and he traffics in human beings.
white slavery? Really?
he's also pretty sick with CCHF.
the Centers for Disease Control is tracking down anyone he might have come in contact with.
so he killed Anne-Marie Weston?
he hasn't admitted that, but the girls were witnesses, and they agreed to testify, so...
go home. You did a great job.
good night, man. - Thanks, buddy.
Hey. - You want something to eat?
no. I just want to go home and...curl up in a ball and maybe cry a little more.
Angela, there's still only a one-in-four chance...- Don't do the math.
we already got totally screwed by the math.
well, then, I have no choice but to take up the piano.
what are you talking about?
I always saw myself staring through microscopes with my kid.
if that's not possible because the baby is blind, then we'll play piano together.
honey, wait a minute.
you should take up sculpture. Very seriously.
what are you talking about? - Because if you can't teach our kid how to paint, then sculpture is an excellent substitute, you know? Maybe even better.
honey, listen... there's only a 25% chance of blindness, so we...
right. You're clever.
what do you think we can handle? You and I, together.
what do you think we can handle?
honestly?
anything. Anything at all.
now, that's good math.
so, what do you think the chances are that me and my dad actually sat in these seats watching the game?
hmm. Let's see. 60, 000 seats.
aren't you going to stop me?
Nah, I actually like watching you do the math, that's all.
I'm just glad that the power's back on.
you know, these pills that I have to take, they look huge.
they're an extremely potent antiviral.
as long as you just don't skip any doses, you'll be fine.
Yeah. Unless I choke to death.
I can't get these things open.
how is your back?
it feels great since you, you know, magically fixed it.
well, it wasn't magic.
well, me and you, we both have different definitions on that word.
that's true. - Right?
you think that...microwave ovens are magic.
...you know, wow, tell you what, cooking a baked potato in five minutes, that's magic.
just, uh... I'm just angry. I'm angry.
not at you. - Okay.
I just need time, that's all. I just need time to kind of...
hang back and find that inner peace before I, you know, get back out there.
you know what we're talking about here, right?
Yes.
you and me...you know, and...and love...happiness and life and fate.
I don't believe in fate. But I know what we're talking about.
I am improving. - Improving?
Yes. I'm... quite strong.
Yeah, well, you've always been strong.
you know the difference between strength and imperviousness, right?
no, not if you're going to get all scientific on me.
well, uh... a substance that is impervious to damage doesn't need to be strong.
Mmm.
when you and I met, I was an impervious substance.
now I am a strong substance.
I think I know what you mean.
a time could come when...you aren't angry anymore and...
I'm strong enough to risk losing the last of my imperviousness.
maybe then, we could try to be together.
I am going to write down a date and guess what that time is, all right?
I want you to do the same.
Why? - Why?
because, when I was a kid, if I wanted something really, really bad,
I'd write it down on a piece of paper and I'd burn it.
it was like a spell. It was bound that my wish would come true.
Why? - Why?
because it... well, you know, you burn it and it was released into the universe.
it's just smoke, Booth. Particulates with no special powers.
fine. Then, what do we have to lose? Go ahead.
come on.
okay, how does this work? - Well, write down...
what you think. - Don't look.
I'm not looking.
okay. - We'll burn it, okay?
on three. Ready? One... - Wait, we're going on three?
let's just... - On three or after three?
bones, let's just burn it together, okay? - Okay.
one, two, three.
Ah-kay. I think you were a little late on that one.
no. No, I think you humped the gun.
humped the gun? You mean jumped the gun.
Oh! Jumped the gun, you mean. I think you were a little lagging... - Don't freak out.
I'm not freaking out--- I just don't want the house to burn down, that's all. I think you were late coming in with it.
no, I put mine in exactly on the count of three.
Justin! - I want to bowl!
it's my birthday and I want to bowl!
I know, sweetheart, but we have to take turns.
no turns! It's my birthday!
okay, okay.
can we let Justin bowl just once?
I want to bowl now!
excuse me! Lane four!
the pins aren't resetting on lane four!
okay, well, look, I gotta reset the lane. So you tell him to cool his jets.
I want to bowl... now! - Yeah, that'll work.
you need to behave, Justin.
I don't have to. I'm the birthday boy!
you know what happens to little boys at a bowling alley who don't behave, - even on their birthday? - What?
I don't think you want to know. Behave!
what can they do to me? I'm the birthday boy.
I'll behave! I'll behave! I'll behave!
I'm pretty sure any day the Guinness people are gonna come and measure me.
you look beautiful.
Yeah, for a water buffalo. It's two days past my due date.
well, the doctor said the baby could be up to two weeks late.
it's time to take matters into my own hands. - What do you mean?
excuse me. Could I have some habanero sauce, please?
hot sauce can bring on labor.
Really?
you confirm with Dr. Banno?
first thing, she has to check the baby's eyes.
she knows.
I'm sure we can handle it either way, but I'd-I'd just like to know as soon as possible.
Dr. Banno has everything under control.
and everyone says she's the best.
I'm sure I've asked you all of this, like, a hundred times, right?
it's okay; I don't care.
don't you think that that might be a little too much there, babe?
Oh, no, this isn't that hot.
you should drink milk, not water.
Oh, God! Milk! Can I get some milk?!
can I get some milk down here, please?
angela says she's going to have her baby today.
she's been saying that every day for two weeks.
well, mathematically speaking, the chances of her being right increase every day.
Wow! Can you say "Blech of a strike?
okay, there's an extreme amount of insect and maggot activity.
that would explain the lack of tissue.
no one noticed him before he dropped?
the owner says the alley's been closed for ten days to resurface the floors.
it just reopened today
judging by this piece of the pelvis and the mandible,
I would say he was a Caucasian male, mid-30s.
how'd he get into the pinsetter?
well, look at that. Looks like he got caught up in the machine, Bones.
it ground him up quite effectively.
the owner said people have been known to sneak back here for, uh, you know...
I do not know. - To have, you know...
snacks? There are a lot of fast food wrappers.
that would account for the maggots, insects and the rapid decomp.
wrong kind of snack. - Bones, you know, sexual liaisons?
so, what do you think, huh? Fell in there after making a little whoopee?
well, only if he died during whoopee, and then fell into the machine.
he was dead when he was ripped apart. At least a week.
there's bruising on the ulna and pisiform and there's a slight fracture on the radial tuberosity.
all antemortem.
did you follow that? - Dead first, and then ground up.
these are defensive wounds, Booth.
the victim was fending off an attack.
definitely failed to fend.
I agree. It appears this man was murdered.
I don't even know why we're here.
you mean existentially, as human beings or...?
Really? I'm about to be a father any second and you're doing stand-up?
no, I mean here, you know?
in the lab when we should be home, waiting in comfort.
it's normal to be worried. Worry can make a guy edgy.
so right now, what you're being is normal.
this is the guy taking apart a meat puppet puzzle.
watch this. I'm about to Brennanize you. - Brennanize?
transverse fracture of the metacarpal of the right thumb, chondromalacia patellae of the left knee, - a notch in the notch of the ulna with... - A notch in the notch?
that's correct. With exostosis of the medial surface.
okay, so what is that? Some kind of, like, repetitive stress stuff?
Yup. Like this.
Yeah, I'm thinking some kind of ritualized offering to, like, the sun, you know?
Yeah, like a figure kinda on a high throne, right?
so, like a, like a Satanic or Illuminati slave.
boys... you're bowling.
Hey, okay. You're ready?! All right, the hot sauce worked?!
uh, no, not yet. Just relax.
bowling? - Bowling, yes.
well, that would correspond with the high level of polyester in his garment.
and the fact that he was found in a bowling alley.
and the fact that he was wearing a bowling shirt with the name "Jeff" sewn on the pocket.
and the team name...
Thunderballs.
I knew a kid in high school everybody called...
right, yeah. Just to be clear, you're not in labor?
no, honey, not currently.
I don't know. The hot sauce doesn't work, the sex doesn't work.
I mean, maybe we should just take a long ride on a bumpy road.
how is that any different than sex?
my mom went into labor after riding on a roller-coaster.
that explains a lot.
I don't know, honey. Maybe we should try an amusement park.
uh, I think we should just let the hot sauce work its magic.
Yeah, sure.
meet Mr. Jeff Fowler.
Jeff Fowler was an accomplished bowler. Lots of trophies, custom balls.
he was also a classic car restorer and dealer, which tells us that he was fastidious, competitive, careful, respectful of design, social. and gregarious.
wait a second. Wait a second This shirt says "Thunderballs."
I'm still doing my psych profile. - I know but this Thunderballs, that's he name of Bones's dad's bowling team: Thunderballs.
Oh, God, I hope this is not another case where Max, you know, killed someone.
I thought he promised no to do at anymore.
well, if he isn't he murderer, I think he might be able to help to catch a bad guy.
thanks for this.
thank the victim's shirt.
Angela, are you in labor? is it time?
I can grab a cab and be there in five mins.
no, no, nothing has happened unfortunately. What are you up to?
I am going to meet Booth and my dad about this mixer case.
I wish you would go into labor. - Yeah, you and me both.
the Zuni Indians believed that labor could be hastened by silence.
did Hodgins tell you to tell me that?
for some reason, I find it very difficult to concentrate on anything else.
well, that's probably because you are a very good friend.
Yes, probably. I'm here, Ange.
I know you are, Sweetie. That's why I love you.
Oh, no. I mean I'm at the diner.
Oh right.
Je-Jeff Fowler was murdered? - His skull was set up like a center pin.
dad, what happened to you?
Oh, nothing, Tempe, nothing.
so he's going back there to get himself a little nookie.
right, so it's true what they say.
dad, you don't end up in a wheelchair for nothing.
okey, if you must know...
I had a very embarrassing physical event occur.
what, did you fall of your bike? - Bed.
Yeah, and Rosamund was inured in that same, uh...
physical event? - Yeah.
OK, so who's Rosamund? - She's a lady friend.
a lady friend? Did she break a hip or something?
she's 36. And by the way, were't we talking about a murder case here?
dad, could you think of why anyone would want to kill Jeff Fowler?
well, he liked to call himself "the close."
and we called him "the Gloater."
you'd kill a guy just for that?
no kidding, you should... hey, cut it out! It wasnt me.
you know, you have trust issues, my friend.
do you think he was killed by a poor loser? - Absolutely, just not me.
okey, we would just talk to the one who he bowled against then.
no no no no. Here's the thing. It's a tournament.
and you're no gonna get these people to talk to you.
it's only gonna lead to more questions.
but the first 48 hours of a murder investigation are crucial. - Yeah - well, you re a bowler, aren't you? - Yeah, yeah, I bowl. High 280s.
what does that mean? - It means it's good.
so why not go in undercover?
come on, you could take my place with the Thundballs.
but you just said they wont talk.
Yeah, bu they love to gossip.
I mean, what so you think bowlers are doing when they're not actually bowling?
I get it. Get' em to say something during the tournament. I'm liking this.
I love undercover. What'll I be?
you can be my girlfriend.
fine. But if Angela goes into labor, we have to pick a flight so that I can be there to catch the baby.
we'll get you here, hell or high water. Yeah, - what? - I don't know. Something weird here.
you are almost polite to each other. What is it? Having a flight?
no, I just really, really want to be there when angela's baby is born.
right, so how soon before I can become a Thunderballs?
don't you love that smell?
the gladiators' amphitheater.
I can discern fried food, sweat, dirty feet, cigarette smoke, chewing gum.
and murder.
okay, now. Please, would you try and act like a couple?
and don't embarrass me. - All right.
Wanda. - Here we go.
Hey, Amber, I want you to meet Buck and Wanda. - You're awful young.
how good can he be? He rents his shoes.
Hey, The Closer rented shoes. - This team is cursed.
first Jeff gets killed, then you fall out of bed.
now it's just me and all this dead weight.
Hey, hey, hey, do not call me dead weight. I'm a champion.
with style and grace.
Hercules Maldonado. They call me...
the Tornado.
easy there, Hercules. You're drooling all over my girl.
his fiancee, to be more exact. That's French.
all right. Here you go, hon. - Thanks, doll.
Yeah! Now that's my muffin at work.
form is everything.
you hear that, Buck?
I didn't mean him. I meant you.
back off, Tina.
don't fraternize with the other team. They play head games.
I'm Alison Rose. Like the flower.
I love your hair.
Alison, back off!
see what I mean?
why don't you take a chill pill, you poisonous little dwarf.
Tod Balacleets is coming. He is the tournament director. AKA The Raven.
I need you to sign in before the preliminaries can begin.
fair play and good sportsmanship above all else. You know the drill.
they call you The Raven?
they call you Buck?
and that's Wanda.
nice to meet you, The Raven.
all right, okay, Thunderballs, versus Strike Force.
let the tournament begin.
so, these red flakes, they were embedded in the front of his skull.
he's so ground up, it'll be tough to determine the cause of death.
at least he was already dead before he was pulled apart.
you know, the only perimortem injury that I could find is this fracture to the nasal bone.
who dies of a broken nose? - Exactly.
if I can't figure out the cause of death
Dr. Brennan's going to be tossing me into that machine.
right.
you're supposed to say,"No, she'll understand."
Oh, but she won't.
Ah, that is so funny.
did you hear that? - Only me being sarcastic.
no, no, no-- something rattled. In the skull.
something dislodged in the enzyme bath.
wait a minute.
he was killed by a broken nose.
when his nose got hit, the force shattered the cribiform plate in the back of his skull.
so fragments from inside his skull literally flew into his brain?
Yeah, that's how he died.
okay, is it time?! All right, I'm going to call Dr. Banno!
you really have to chill, Hodgins.
come on, come on! All right!
that's how it's done.
you got it.
What're you doin'?
I log every game we've played in here.
how each lane plays. Who screwed up. How well I did.
here's where I'll be in 2026.
"world Champion of the World. " That's a redundant statement.
I'm so good, they have to say it twice.
Yes! - It's okay. Not to worry.
we will win the next round, no? - And you know what would be good?
I'll be in the video arcade until needed, and not a second before.
listen, you see the guy Hercules over there?
the Raven assigned him to us. After The Closer got killed.
well, I don't see any other way for him to get on the team. He's terrible.
it's not about playing, Bones. It's about catching a murderer.
then why are you trying to win?
first rule of undercover-- you got to make it look real.
you want to make it look real, maybe you should be a little more affectionate with each other.
I'll go talk to Hercules.
what?
good game, Hercules. - Gracias, senorita.
although, without the venom of the little one, I would have been much better.
that I would never do. - But you have.
no. I have my own shoes.
you see, he used rental shoes. A disgrace.
a real bowler does not rely on superstition.
I don't understand.
Mr. Fowler believed in luck.
his lucky rental shoes, lucky lane number 12, his lucky little shirt, lucky beer mug.
it's foolishness. - I agree.
Yes. You see I
I'm a real man who does not need superstition, because I have God on my side.
I'm sure God wants you to be a good bowler.
and when The Closer was going around telling everyone that I was terrible, I knew
I had faith that, one day, I would have my chance.
and now, huh?
now I do.
because he was murdered?
God works in mysterious ways, no?
well, I suppose that's one way to explain it.
Toodle-oo, Bucky.
dude... that old fossil really wants to share milk and cookies with you, if you get my drift.
Yeah, yeah, I get that a lot.
Yeah, I know what you mean. - No, you don't.
Hey, when it comes to Alison, everyone is fair game.
Alison put the moves on you? - Check it out, man, I'm fresh.
what about The Closer?
Yeah. All the chicks dug The Closer.
he was a huge fish in this dinky little pond.
with him gone, I am the hair apparent. - Hair apparent?
that's what they call it, dude. Read a book.
the splinters and chips dislodged from the inside and shot through the brain matter.
okay, you do know that hot sauce
the only thing it's doing is making the baby sweat.
my dad says that this always brings on labor.
Oh, yeah. And a rock 'n' roll guitar god is definitely the go-to guy for obstetrics.
any idea what caused the damage to the nasal and ethmoid bones?
okay, I tried a 2 x 4.
it would have caused the brain damage, but it would have crushed the frontal bone, the zygomatic bone and caused a Lefort fracture.
we need something with a more concentrated force.
Yeah, maybe a hammer?
wow, that's nice, but a little too concentrated.
can you zoom in a bit? - Yeah.
we need a point of impact concentrated over the defined area, but with the energy dispersed around the edges.
right, yeah, of course. Something with rounded edges.
that way the primary point of impact would be the nose, and the edges would account for the spidering.
well, it's not a bat.
none of those match the fracture pattern.
Oh, my God.
what, do you know what it is?
Oh, my God.
what? What's the murder weapon, Angie?
are you kidding? - Come on, now, you're the expert.
you've been jumping around all day, and when my water breaks you don't even notice?
what?
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
okay, here we go, here we go. It's show time!
okay, okay, I'm calm, very calm, okay?
no panic, no hysteria.
we can totally handle this, right, Angie?
get the car! - Right!
where the hell are my keys?!
now that's what we call a contraction.
Oh, God, that's what you call a contraction, you rotten old bat.
I call it a fireball of pain.
she didn't mean that-- the "rotten old bat" part.
I think I did.
that's okay. Everyone reacts to the stress and pain of childbirth differently.
believe me, I have seen it all.
I wouldn't bet on it. Angela's a very unique individual.
shut up, Hodgins. Your voice is incredibly annoying.
we're going to wait for the contractions to get a little closer together before asking you to push.
Oh, God, they get closer together?
wait a minute, I knew that. I knew that, right, honey? Didn't I know that?
I-I'm sorry that I called you a-a rotten old bat.
it's okay. And, yes, you did know that.
Angela, you know everything you need to know to have this baby.
and what you forget, your husband will remind you.
doc, Doctor...
right. Okay, so...breathe through your nose.
do not tell me what to do.
okay.
But-but-but coach me like we practiced.
those are mutually exclusive. - Don't argue with me.
right.
Hey, how's it going?
it's, you know, kind of hard to describe.
this is great. This is really great. I am so ready for this.
is it okay if I ask Hodgins a question?
is it?
Yeah, yes, we're just lying around waiting for these contractions to get closer together.
go for it, bud.
okay, I put that red flake we found into the mass spectrometer, but I don't really know how to read the results.
I can help you with that.
also, um, I have no idea how to get the Angelatron to find the weapon.
Oh, okay. Uh, you need to run it through my program.
it's really easy, I'll, I'll, I'll help you through it.
what's this? - Hello, Dr. Banno, I'm Wendell Bray.
we're solving a murder.
I'm pretty sure we're supposed to be solving a baby.
um, okay, so...Wendell? Let me see the mass spec readings.
Wendell, um, what you...
what you need to do is run it through a program called "Spatula."
Hey, Sherry, how's it going?
Oh, hey, Cam. We are solving a murder when we're supposed to be concentrating on bringing a life into the world.
Oh, contraction. Good stiff one, looks like.
Hey, hey, that's polyurethane.
did you say polyurethane?
bowling balls are made of polyurethane. You know, that could be your murder weapon.
great, I'll run it through the Scapula. - It's Spatula.
okay. Sorry, Ange.
Bye! And good luck, Angela. And you too, Sherry.
Yes! Eat it! - Rude.
a little sportsmanship, if you please.
sportsmanship is for losers and wanna-bes.
I'll be in the arcade.
kid was raised by wolves. Till she killed and ate them all.
I'll get your ball for you, Muffin.
her daddy must've been a baker,'cause that is a great set of buns.
down, boy.
that's okay, you got your eye on her, too. I get it.
but all's fair, old man. And I gotta warn you, I'm in the prime of my sexual magnetism.
go, Buck! Come on, Buck. - Go, Buck!
why are you bowling so badly? - My feet are killing me.
this is Wanda. Talk to me.
Hey, buddy! I need a pair of shoes that aren't going to rot my feet.
one with the ball, one with the lane, one with the pin.
let's go...
he's a car thief.
what? - Blake.
isn't that the best thing about bowling? Getting to meet a wide range of people?
kid's a car thief? - A compulsive joy rider.
the guy that got killed--didn't he restore cars?
that would make them natural enemies, I guess. I never thought of that.
Maybe...Blake killed Jeff.
Hey, Alison. You're up.
later.
Wendell identified the murder weapon.
well, great. It's about time. What is it?
a bowling ball.
Oh, gee, that's a big help. - Great. That's really gonna help in here.
Oh, I got a great idea. I tell you what, why don't you use your murder ray, there, and look in Blake's bag.
it's not a murder ray, it's an ultraviolet light. Why?
Why? Because they were natural enemies.
be careful. Distract him.
what do you think you're doing? - Are you tampering with his equipment?
cause that is a grievous league violation.
no, no, no. She's just looking, right?
what's with the black light?
I'm just looking to see if you used any substance to change the surface of your ball.
right! Like, uh, baby powder for the, for your grip.
I don't cheat. - Yeah, but you steal cars.
that would make me a thief, and not a cheater.
you know what we should do? We just call over to The Raven.
Why? No, please.
for to become our unbalanced mediator.
is there a problem here?
no problem.
I'm eyeing you Thunderballs. You know why? 'Cause Jeff Fowler got what he deserved.
and so does anyone else who cheats.
we don't cheat.
I bet he killed Jeff. - Why's that?
well, because Jeff superglued The Raven's hand into his bowling ball at a Dialing-for-Dollars bowl-a-thon a couple years ago.
Yeah, you can see it on the interwebs computer. It's very funny.
the Raven has never competed again.
you know, they say sometimes, if you walk by the bowling alley at night, you can hear him yelling at God, and swearing revenge!
so what I want you to do is I want you to call Sweets, all right? Have The Raven picked up, so we can have him checked out for a case of the killer crazies.
everything looks great. - No, it is not great. It is not great.
I want this thing out of me, and it's staying in.
would you like to reconsider an epidural?
Hey, yeah, why not, Ange?
because natural childbirth is a beautiful, beautiful thing.
excuse me, Dr. Banno. You're, you're blocking the, uh...
according to Dr. Brennan,"bowling ball" wasn't specific enough.
dude. What do you want us to do about it?
you have to, you have to program a series of variables into the Angelatron.
which mimic a spread of...Oh, God Almighty!...spread of
take me now!
a spread of variables with...Mars, Saturn, and Uranus!
Oh, babe!
I'll figure it out myself.
the Raven!
that effectively ended your career.
I'm the tournament director now. People respect me.
right. But your true desire was to be a professional bowler, and you would have attained that desire, if Jeff Fowler hadn't put superglue in your bowling ball.
it was just a prank. - Which ruined your life.
I was a great bowler. But after what Fowler did, I never trusted my release again.
fate can be unkind. But you can't fight it.
but...you can take revenge on the deliverer of that fate.
the guy who stole your, your life.
now, you keep saying that he ruined my life.
but I supervise 12 leagues; I have the respect of my peers; I have a family.
well, sort of. The woman that I see sometimes, her stepkid seems to like me.
I am a well-respected official.
you know, it could be said that you dress in black and take revenge on real bowlers, by humiliating them in the guise of...officialdom.
are you being so cruel to me in the hopes of getting some kind of "crazy murderer" response?
Yeah, I am. - That's extremely cold-hearted.
it's my job.
well, how did I do? - Quite well, actually.
but we still need you to provide an alibi for your whereabouts on the fourteenth.
I was bowling. Over at the Granville Lanes.
no one knows me there, so I'm less self-conscious.
so you're saying there's no one to vouch for you.
well, someone must have seen me there, right?
I am The Raven.
okay. We are in Spatula. I think.
this should get us a variety of bowling balls.
then we can, uh, run different scenarios to determine the weight.
very good. She always makes this look so difficult.
no.
I am not sure that was right. - I know, I know.
in the counsels of government...
okay, I'm pretty sure he's not the killer.
what are you doing? - I am not really qualified to do this.
whoa, Mr. Bray.
look, maybe, maybe I should just ask Angela.
uh, is, is this a good time?
I don't want to rush you, but you've got less than a minute before the next contraction, Wendell.
uh, right. Okay, uh, this thing doesn't work. It started out all right, but now it's...
a million images started flying by,
Oh, my God. Did you hit "purge"? Hey, hey, get away from my equipment.
do you want me to... - No. Walk away, Wendell.
don't touch anything. - Go.
okay. We're, uh...going.
let's try breathing, okay? Four short breaths.
Oh, God, shut up! You sound like a quacking duck!
Oh, God, okay.
come on, Buck.
we are doomed! We only needed two pins to win, and you left them both standing.
I still got another ball.
Oh, yeah, right. A 7-10 split.
it's highly improbable, statistically approaching the impossible.
sometimes when you speak, it's like you, you watch PBS on purpose.
you need two pins, I'll get two pins.
something is wrong. You shouldn't have been able to do that.
Oh, honey, give the man his props.
I'd like to, but it's simply improbable.
okay. Force equals mass times acceleration.
okay. To break a nose, you need a very low force with a large mass, say around 30 Gs, or...
no, no, no.
this is like watching Michelle do her homework.
maybe I should try to...Oh! Wait! Hey!
do you need me to
because of the amount of force it takes to break the victim's nose is so low, it means that the mass and acceleration must be fairly low as well, so...
in fact, any mass over 2. 26 kilograms, wielded at almost any acceleration, would be too much damage.
so 2. 26 kilograms... - Five pounds.
the ball could not have weighed more than five pounds.
what are you doing? - Looking through Amber's laptop.
don't you need a warrant for that?
if Buck and I ever have a child, she will not turn out like Amber.
Yeah, Temperance, it's just us monkeys. You don't have to keep up your cover story.
I find it helpful to remain in character.
see how she improves month-to-month?
Yeah, very impressive.
these are all the statistics from lane 12.
so?
so, there have been some very difficult splits made on lane 12, including Booth's.
you...you think Amber falsified her records?
I think she tampered with the lane.
Hey, Joe, my feet are itching like crazy. Don't you fumigate these?
wear a size 12? - Yeah.
probably got Fowler's shoes. He never wore socks. Feet stunk. We all hated it.
superstitious bastard.
how do you calibrate the, uh, pin setters?
I don't do anything. Computers do it all.
so someone could reset the pin placement?
Yeah, I guess. You know, I don't really give a crap.
what? - I was right.
you never could have gotten that 7-10 split.
so you gotta keep giving up hope on me, there?
no. Someone got into the computer system, and recalibrated lane 12, so the pins set closer together.
that's why Fowler thought that lane 12 was lucky.
it's easier to bowl strikes and get splits.
I'll be damned. Sweets was right. Fowler was a cheat.
this is Wanda. At the bowling alley.
the size and shape of the injury indicates that he was killed with a bowling ball.
but the ball would have to be five pounds or less.
a child's bowling ball? Thanks, Wendell.
what's he saying, it's a kid's ball?
it appears so.
Hey, what if it wasn't Fowler who rigged the lane? What if it was Amber?
Fowler figures it out... - She kills him.
if we ever had a child like that...
Oh, that's never ever gonna happen, Wanda. Ever.
this is Wanda the bowler at the bowling tournament, bowling.
Dr. Brennan, I'm here with Dr. Hodgins.
is he back from the baby being born?
Oh, no, Angela's still in labor. She stalled or something.
listen, tell her that bowling balls--they don't flake, okay? They chip.
he said bowling balls don't flake.
what do they do? - Uh, they chip. Is there a difference?
this is my area, okay, Wendell?
this is what I do.
okay, everybody is getting a little cranky now.
if what you found was a flake, that suggests that the murder weapon was not a bowling ball.
then what else is made of polyurethane and flakes?
this type of polyurethane meets national traffic safety standards.
you're looking for a motorcycle helmet with red sparkles.
he says we're looking for a motorcycle helmet with red sparkles.
thank you.
she said "thank you" and hung up. H-How's it going there, buddy?
good news. It's time to push. - It's time to push.
it's gonna be all right.
okay, babe.
ready?
who owns a motorcycle?
george Clooney does.
no, Booth means in the league.
nobody. - Ah, this sucks.
wait a minute, wait a minute. He does.
the shoe guy? - Yeah.
we're up! Let's go.
well, we quit. - What?! Hercules!
we have to catch a killer, and then we have to go visit our friend in the hospital. You understand.
Hercules! They're bailing! - They're forfeiting?
what? I don't want to win like that.
Hey, a win is a win; I'm okay with this.
uh, what are you doing to my helmet?
looks like blood.
everybody! Everybody get back to the game!
listen, kid, there are things more important than your bowling average.
do not mess with me, you mullet-haired hick!
listen, kid, I'm with the FBI. I'm an FBI agent. You watch your mouth.
Hey, you! You're under arrest for the murder of Jeff Fowler.
you run, I swear I'll shoot you.
dad!
he was gonna run; I saw it in his eyes.
you know what? You'd have killed him, too. He never washed his feet.
I mean, look at my hands! All of my fingernails fell off.
and then my girlfriend left me for The Raven, and I really liked her kid.
I didn't even hit him that hard. It was just a tap.
couldn't you go easy on him?
Yeah, Jeff Fowler was a pretty terrible guy.
let him go. - Go easy on him?!
you ruined everything! - No...Stop her.
you are a horrible child!
Oh, that's good, Angie! Good, Angie!
we're very close.
I want to talk about if the baby is blind.
now? - Yeah, yeah, now.
okay, okay. Well, well, yeah, we're ready for that.
Yeah, we're ready. Right? - Totally.
it'll only take a moment to check your baby's eyes. I won't keep you waiting, trust me.
have I ever told you how-how wonderful your voice is?
it's like hot tea and-and honey.
any child who has a father with a voice like yours is just...
have I ever told you how good you smell?
and-and how soft your skin is?
and how every time you take my hand,
I feel your whole life vibrating with mine?
my God. You're going to be wonderful parents, no matter what happens.
okay! Push, Ange!
this is the one. Here we go.
go, Ange, go!
push! Yeah, that's it!
he's here.
he?
it's a boy. - He's a he.
give me just a moment.
we're a family.
your son's vision is fine.
everything about him is just fine.
everybody, I would like you to meet my son,
these are your friends.
congratulations, brother.
what was it like?
it was wonderful. And beautiful.
it was a dream.
look at this guy.
it's from Booth, too.
thank you.
they looked so happy.
Yeah, well, they had a baby.
their whole lives have changed. You'd think they'd be a little more apprehensive.
well, you know, having a baby--that's a good thing.
you really think that? - Yeah, it's a great thing.
what?
Oh, come on. Bones, look, the baby, the baby's fine.
it's healthy. They had a healthy baby. All right?
they love each other. This is the happiest day of their lives. Okay?
what?
you're the father.
here at the American Heritage Museum.
one word is crucial when leading tours:
C-R-A-B-- CRAB-- Communicate, Respond, Adjust, and above all-- Be prepared.
tourists will ask stupid questions, you will know how to answer them.
ms. Tillotson... - Do not interrupt.
but... - No.
Lincoln did not do his homework on the back of a shovel with a lump of coal.
no, he did not walk a mile...
Oh, dear God.
where is the rest of me?
right, okay, great, thanks.
they say they've cordoned off the museum.
the less the press knows about this, the better-- trust me.
so, any new listings?
nothing that I would live in.
well, you know, we're running out of time here, Bones.
I mean, you're due, what, in six weeks.
we got to find a house.
well, there is a simple solution.
no, uh-uh, I need my man cave.
then I need an anthropologist cave.
all right, so we need a man cave, a girl cave, and a perfect baby's room with at least an acre of land.
no wonder we can't find a house.
whoa, yeah, It's right. Whoa, whoa, what, you all right?
Oh, she just kicked.
she's very strong. - Okay.
check the listings again.
I'm looking.
just want to make sure we didn't miss anything.
I actually think the Vatican was in on the Lincoln assassination.
they hated Lincoln since he defended a former priest against the bishop of Chicago.
all right, it's human blood.
yeah? Think it came from him?
the serologist will let us know.
look, all I'm saying is that John Wilkes Booth was secretly a member of the Knights of the Golden Circle, affiliated with Rome.
okay.
little friendly advice-- do not mention Booth to Booth.
they are related, and he'll shoot you.
what do we got here?
Hi. - Hi.
Hi. - The killer left a message in blood.
Where's the rest of me?
I assume he's referring to the rest of the remains because Lincoln seems intact.
do we have a time of death yet, Dr. Hodgins?
well, according to the blowfly eggs in the orbital sockets, we're looking at about two days.
there is something very strange about this vertebral column.
strange how?
the articulating vertebrae all appear to be from the same spine, but...
they're in the wrong order.
what, a killer dissected out the spine and separated the vertebrae?
is that a big deal?
it means detaching all the intrasegmental ligaments, the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments, and the supraspinous ligament, not to mention somehow reattaching them.
okay, that is a big deal.
ABSOLUTELY-- it seems the killer reassembled the vertebrae, out of order, on purpose.
he's sending us a message.
looks like some kind of deranged surgeon sewed this back together.
what is that?
looks like some kind of nasty string.
I have a bad feeling about this, but I'll wait for the electrophoresis results to share it.
judging by the small skull and the nuchal crest, the victim was a female Caucasian.
her wisdom teeth haven't fully erupted, suggesting she was in her early 20s.
okay, bad feeling officially confirmed.
the string the killer used is made out of human gut.
serology results just came in.
the message the killer left-- "Where's the rest of me?
why are you looking at us like that, Mr. Bray? Spit it out.
they ran the usual ABO groups, plus enzyme and protein markers.
and...?
the blood at the scene isn't from the victim.
it's from five other people.
five different people?
Yeah. - Call the lab, tell them we need DNA.
tag it a priority, and if anyone gives you grief, tell them to refer to me.
exterminators treated the museum last night?
Yeah, looks like our killer used a laser pointer to burn out the image from one of the security cameras.
you see that? The camera goes out there at 5: 51.
okay, so the killer leaves the remains, writes the message, gets out before anyone can spot him.
right, so we have one confirmed dead and, what, five maybes?
what kind of nut bag does that?
well, defacing an iconic American figure suggests that he craves attention, right?
and he demands we engage by posing two mysteries
one for the public-- "Where's the rest of me?
and a more private mystery for us-- the reordered spine.
well, if he has something to say, why doesn't he just say it?
cause this way, he's forcing us down the path he wants us to go.
it's very manipulative, meaning high IQ, which is consistent with the fact that he was able to dissect a spine.
which tells us he's comfortable killing people.
Yeah, practice makes perfect.
it's likely that he has prior offenses.
got a name?
right. Great. Thanks.
so one of the guys on the exterminator crew has a felony record
by the name of Sam Sachs.
okay, we've got the C1 vertebra.
T9, C2, C5, and then the T1, but with both transverse processes removed.
why are we writing all this down again?
because the killer did not reorder 24 articulating vertebrae just for kicks and giggles, and that makes this some kind of cipher, which means I need the order written down before you go running the bony bits through the wash cycle.
okay, continuing. T7...
I'm telling you, my grandfather would expect me to know what to do.
I ever tell you that he was a code breaker back in World War II, huh?
worked for Admiral Nimitz.
mine worked for Colonel Chicken.
what? It's kind of military. He had a uniform.
the C4... also has the right transverse process removed.
it all means something.
I just have to figure out what.
uh, you sure I can't grab a smoke?
I'll tell you what-- we'll let you trash your lungs on your own time.
come on, man, just a couple puffs.
you have quite a record here. Burglary, car theft.
maybe one of these guys out there got some nicotine gum.
no.
also says here that you graduated to a couple pops for violent assault.
that's what we call a pattern of escalation.
pattern of what? - Escalation, Sam.
things just started to get worse and worse.
okay, maybe I made a couple bad moves, but it's a whole new me.
I mean, I have an important job preserving our national heritage.
you kill cockroaches.
obviously you don't understand museum hygiene.
mama roaches-- they have, like, 40 babies a pop.
they eat the paint, the wallpaper, and drop their roach feces all over the historical artifacts.
no kidding.
I'm our nation's front line of defense.
against roach poop.
it's very stressful, which is why I need my smokes.
uh, Agent Booth, you recall the, um, profile we discussed.
Oh, right, he has a higher IQ. - Yeah.
I guess we can let Sam slide on this one, right?
that's a giant relief.
so can I have my smokes back?
the guy we're looking for glitched out security cameras without getting caught on film, so he definitely knew of a blind spot.
so I'm assuming you do, too.
me? Why, why would I know?
because I don't think you can go 15 minutes without having a cigarette.
you get caught on camera, you lose your job.
you swear I won't get in trouble?
we swear. - Okay.
Yeah, there's a blind spot.
I ran her facial reconstruction through Missing Persons. Nothing.
it's the DNA results. This has got to be some kind of record.
Oh, my God. - Something wrong?
they found a match for all five blood samples from the killer's message.
Oh, it's our lucky day.
no.
the blood is from five different FBI agents from the DC field office.
what part of "no comment" do you not understand?
my source told me the dead girl's spine was tied together with human gut.
no comment to that either?
I have a whole bunch of comments, and they all have four letters.
W-W-Whoa, who's this guy?
Ezra Krane-- I'm with the Washington Standard.
I have questions about the museum murder.
great, public affairs, second floor.
how are newspapers supposed to compete with the Internet when you people won't even throw us a crumb?
we are trying to solve a brutal murder.
maybe after that, we can have a chat about your business plan.
come on, just cut me a break, will you?
the paper just laid off 60 people and I have a wedding next month.
we'll send you a blender.
I have a source, Caroline.
I want a name. - You know I can't do that.
wait a second, there's a murderer out there.
if you have information, you have to hand that over to me now.
if I name my source, no one ever talks to me again.
then leave or I'll arrest you.
come on, is this really necessary?
don't tempt me. Get lost. March.
okay, fine. I'm leaving. - Bye.
either we have a leak, cher, or the killer is talking to the press.
we'd better solve this before the whole thing turns out to be your fault.
Dr. Brennan, you have to trust me on this.
this killer is intelligent, manipulative, and hungry for attention.
also very well versed in anatomy.
Oh, here's one that's in our price range.
adorable fixer-upper with natural landscaping.
no, no, no, no. That means a small house with weeds.
bring your own bulldozer.
look, the blood at the scene clearly indicates he was targeting the FBI.
artistic bungalow with wood-like floors in secluded setting.
a shack with purple walls, cracked linoleum.
bottom line is, given your condition, I don't think that you should be out in the field.
if the positive adjectives indicate irreparable flaws, then what does "tear down" mean?
I understand-- you're under a lot of pressure right now.
I... I've been trying to find Daisy a birthday present, and the pressure to make the right purchase is, is, is nothing like looking for a house when you're pregnant, I know that.
I found the agents whose blood was at the scene.
they're all alive and well.
did you figure out how the killer obtained their blood?
FBI blood drive, two weeks ago.
okay, well, he's clearly targeting his rage at the FBI.
he wants us to acknowledge how smart he is.
listen, Bones. This guy is really dangerous; I don't...
sweets already explained; I'm not going out in the field.
wait... Seriously? You-you were listening?
given the demands of a growing fetus,
I'll focus on the lab, and the real estate section.
we know these vertebrae are some kind of code, but what kind?
this is crazy.
I don't even know what we're looking for.
I mean, is the message numbers or words?
then don't worry, babe, we'll get this.
could be a government thing, Ange. We could be uncovering something huge.
I can't disappoint my grandfather.
okay, all right.
what about the total number of characters? Does that help any?
well, there's 48 total, if you count letters and numbers that repeat.
and 13 if you don't.
so, what has 13 digits?
an ISBN number.
what if it's a book?
what if there's a message in a book? - No.
three of the characters are letters, and ISBNs are just numbers.
we could group the numbers according to strings that have the same letters.
maybe.
okay, uh... You're guessing now, and-and you never do that.
maybe each section is a different encryption key.
honey, you're fritzing out.
Hello? Honey? Do you even hear me?
no. Yes, that's it.
there is no point in him saying something unless we can hear it.
so the code has to be simple.
forget encryption keys, I am totally overthinking this!
make it disappear. Back to the drawing board here, Ange.
okay.
dazzle me with your progress.
well, I paid a visit to the museum and found the security cam blind spot the exterminator was talking about.
please tell me you found the killer's driver's license and a complete set of prints.
no, but I did find this.
great. He's minty fresh. Good to know.
no, no, no, no, no. Wait'll you see, huh?
it's a homemade laser pointer.
that little thing disabled the best security cameras in town?
Yeah, the guy, he completely MacGyver-ed it.
the diode is from an old DVD player, and the switch is from a toaster.
so, we're looking for a tech savvy guy who hates the FBI.
Yeah, that's what Sweets said.
I'll get him the records of every geek we've put away in the last two years.
see if he can find one with motive, means and opportunity.
make it five years. I want to be thorough.
cause you got a little Booth coming.
you found a house yet?
well, we haven't agreed on that yet.
what do you mean,"oh"?
I figured the "oh" implies all the potential problems.
why gild the lily?
problems?
according to the isotope profile from her tooth enamel, the victim grew up in Denmark.
that would explain why we haven't been able to ID her.
have Angela forward the facial reconstruction to the Danish Embassy.
meanwhile, we have to determine cause of death.
I found a particulate embedded in the anterior aspect of the T4.
there are also hairline fractures on the neural arches.
that could be consistent with a high velocity injury.
maybe a gunshot; it could be a bullet fragment.
a bullet wouldn't explain the pitting on the vertebral body.
unless it shattered a rib into smaller projectiles.
that's possible, but I'll need the rest of the bones to be sure.
get this to Hodgins to analyze.
they reduced it by how much?
okay, yeah, do me a favor, just send me the link, fast.
possible house?
Hey, real estate agent said it was perfect.
right? What do you got?
all right, so, I looked through the files that Caroline sent, and there's a hacker named Christopher Pelant.
socially marginalized, IQ off the charts.
in 2009, he took down the Senate website. Check it out.
Where's the website"? Well, that's his MO. He's asking a question.
Yeah, and posting his own face, totally consistent with our killer's need for attention.
then, last year, he took down the Department of Defense network.
the FBI convicted him on multiple charges of wire fraud and computer fraud.
huh, so, he hates us.
perfect?! That's not the perfect place.
that's not perfect. Huh?
my car is bigger than that. - It's cozy.
perfect place... Well, you know, at least this Pelant guy is promising.
there's one little issue with him.
no computers or internet, and I haven't been past my front door in six months.
condition of parole.
right, look at that-- your little electronic tether.
we're checking with the company that monitors that.
they ping him every 38 seconds.
when was the last time that you were at the National Historical Museum?
Oh, uh, sixth grade field trip. I aced history.
what about Biology?
did you ever, uh, dissect a person?
you guys think that I killed that girl at the museum, don't you?
sweets here is one of our better profilers, and he seems to think that it's possible.
the dude from the Washington Standard said you'd think so.
Yeah! Yeah, yeah. He covered my trial.
I'll tell you the same thing I told him when he called:
I'm not a criminal, I'm a hacktivist.
a hacktivist that took out DOD's complete network and left the U. S. military defenseless for, what was it, three and a half hours?
the company that built that network got the contract because of campaign contributions.
I exposed the corruption.
I'm a patriot.
soldiers could've died.
that's exactly why I did it.
so, if you're not supposed to have computers, what do you call that?
Ah, it doesn't work. Some, uh, some dumb-ass pulled the fan cable and fried the thing.
why do you keep it?
reminder of better days.
right. Thanks. He's clean.
monitor company says he hasn't left the premises.
keep in touch.
I'm sure it had to be something simple.
this sucks. I give up.
Hey, if I'm burning date night privileges for this, you don't get to give up.
remember your grandfather and the whole Admiral Nimitz thing.
should it have been me, we would have lost the battle of Midway.
all right, let's look at this another way.
maybe we try another format.
Hey, what if we're supposed to assume that the ones with broken processes are meant to be read as spaces?
maybe we should just look at the numbers.
Yeah, that's worth a try.
wait a minute, 20166 is the Dulles zip code. That's a coincidence?
481. 481 is a Justice Department phone prefix.
I called them a million times on Freedom of Information Act stuff.
so, we have a phone number and a zip code.
maybe that middle part is an address.
the C4. The C4 was only broken on the right side.
what if that's the 4 side?
what if we're only supposed to read it as a C.
3117 C... 3117 C Street?
all right, reverse directory. Give me a minute.
Dulles makes it a 571 area code phone number.
click on the map hyperlink.
that's the Justice Department Archive Building.
353 must be a room number. We solved it.
hold on, what about those last four digits? The 5291?
we'll figure it out. I gotta call Booth.
crappy date night... ...excellent crime-solving.
look, I told you guys, you're not allowed down here.
we're looking for room 353.
look, I've got to talk to my boss.
you guys have to wait here.
there it is.
central, this is Andy Lau down in sector three...
there's a keypad; you don't think that could be the last four number Hodgins found.
Yes, I do.
who the hell gave you that...
what are we even looking for? - Anything suspicious.
out of the ordinary. Just keep your eyes open, all right?
think I found some blood.
blood?
that, uh,"Where's the rest of me" question-- I think we just answered it.
get those back to the Jeffersonian as quick as possible.
bones gets the rest of the remains.
hopefully, she'll be able to figure out cause of death.
looks like these are all criminal case files.
closed cases? - No, no, no.
it just says "Investigation Suspended.
whoa, whoa, wait a second. There's either open files or closed files.
what the hell does that mean?
I don't... Oh, hold on.
careful with that. That's evidence. - I know, I know, I'm sorry.
this could just be very important.
Yes! Score! - What is it? What?
I... I got Daisy's birthday present.
it's a powder blue Vespa. It's cute as a button.
you got her a scooter? - Got it ten cents on the dollar at the, uh, U.S. Marshals' auction.
they got everything there; they got boats, cars...
my bad, your plate is full.
solve murder, buy house, have baby.
Yeah, go through the files-- now.
and give me some of the perp names.
all right. Colin Freakley. - Freakley.
wait-- Cassutto, he's a CI.
confidential informant? Well, check out some of these.
all right, Gino Nicoletta, Jimmy Valentine... These are all FBI informants.
Yeah, well, there are about 20 of these.
looks like someone decided not to prosecute their crimes.
well, maybe Headquarters feels it's worth letting them slide on the small stuff in order to, you know, solve the bigger crimes.
no, this isn't small stuff. These are major felonies.
drug trafficking, extortion. Fraud.
Yeah, if I was one of their victims,
I'd do pretty much anything to call attention to this.
there's additional pitting and microfractures to the posterior of the ribs and sternum.
damage to the inside of front and back? What'd she do? Explode from the inside?
how is that possible?
well, anything is possible, Mr. Bray, except finding affordable housing in the District of Columbia.
king of the Cipher is on a roll.
I got results back on that particle you found embedded in the bones.
it' s camphor.
they use that in fireworks.
so?
there's damage to the inside of both front and back ribs.
did the killer shove some kind of homemade explosive down her throat?
well, there's only one way to find out.
I'm gonna kill this man.
you should record me saying that so you have the evidence to arrest me.
my source reports that the rest of the museum victim's remains were discovered in a secret file room.
they point a bloody virtual finger at wrongdoings by the FBI.
can you believe this?
how the hell did he find out about the archives?
all he'll say is that he got a phone call.
from who?
I have no idea, but I fully intend to kill them, too.
why is this man wearing an Easter egg on his head?
cause he got his girlfriend a Vespa. - A Vespa?
Yeah, I was just making sure it's comfortable. Sorry.
did you finish going through the CI files?
Yeah. The worst of the bunch is Daniel Cassutto.
he ran a real estate scam.
one of his victims committed suicide right in front of his daughter
a woman named Sophia Berman.
you have any shrink-y goodness to sprinkle on that one?
suicide of a parent is a serious motivator, and Berman is head of I. T. at a local hospital, so...
that would give her technical expertise.
and a place to rearrange a spine.
go get her. - All right.
and get that thing out of here.
so, we covered a skeleton in processed meat...
simulate soft tissue. - And the wet suit simulates skin.
we should be able to determine whether an internal explosion caused the unusual damage to the inside of the victim's bones.
I just want to be clear that I'm only going along with this out of fondness for Mr. Lincoln.
we'll take it.
help me with this?
hey... Ready?
now put the explosive in his chest cavity.
fire in the bones!
five, four, three, two, one!
I'm gonna, I'm gonna...check it. - Careful.
that'd be good.
Wendell, why don't you check it.
I... I'm not wearing gloves.
good. Good.
thanks for seeing us, Ms. Berman.
I can't believe you people finally want to talk about Daniel Cassutto.
so you think that Cassutto defrauded your father?
Oh, I know it.
cleared out my father's pension, life insurance, everything.
I reported it, and you people didn't do a damn thing.
so you blame the FBI that your father committed suicide?
last month I wanted to take my father out to dinner and cheer him up.
when I got there, he was sitting in the den with a gun.
he told me he was sorry, then he pulled the trigger.
I saw the top of his head come off.
I'm sorry. - No, you're not. You made it happen.
you didn't prosecute Cassutto because he works for you.
uh, the museum killer went to a lot of trouble to bring public attention to this, Sophia.
what, you think I did that?
this another way for the FBI to cover their ass?
how'd you find out that Cassutto, uh, was an informant?
I got a call.
couple days after my father killed himself.
from a journalist at the Washington Standard.
someone who cared.
Yeah.
he was trying to do a story on FBI corruption, but the editor wouldn't print it because it didn't have any juice.
excuse me. Well, it has a lot of juice now.
what do you got?
based on Brennan's strontium isotope information,
I forwarded the facial reconstruction to the Danish Embassy.
they I. D. her?
Yeah. Yeah, a girl named Inger Johannsen.
local family went out of town for a couple of months, and she was house-sitting for them.
well, that makes sense-- you know, the killer needed a body, so he picked a girl that no one's gonna miss.
Yeah. That's pretty cold, right?
Yeah, pretty cold. It's horrible.
so text me where she was staying.
will do.
this is a nice neighborhood.
maybe you guys could find a house here.
Ah, we might be done looking.
so you're just gonna live with Dr. Brennan?
no, no-- I may have found a place.
What?! Really?
Yeah. - Congratulations!
let's check around back, all right?
wait, we're in the middle of an investigation
when do you have time to get a house?
let's just say your Vespa gave me the idea.
Oh, seriously? The auction?
I don't think anyone's home.
look, I haven't told Bones yet, so if you say anything, we're finished.
what is it?
is that what I... - Yeah.
this is where she was killed.
look at that.
he knew we would find this.
he's playing with us.
based on the tissue in the Jacuzzi,
Dr. Saroyan believes the murder occurred Sunday night.
doing okay, Bones? - I'm frustrated.
I saw multiple properties today, none of which were even close.
well, I may have found a place.
Really? - Yeah.
but the thing is, the owner, you know, has just a little bit of a questionable history.
what kind of questionable?
let's just say his new address is Leavenworth.
Oh. So... we'd be acquiring the home of a convicted criminal?
Yeah, you're right. Forget it.
that's no place for our kid.
never mind. Forget it. - Why?
when the Dani of New Guinea defeated the Amungme tribesmen, the Dani valued the huts of their vanquished enemy as symbols of their mightiness.
right. So the crook who lives in the hut that I found is like...
you could say, our vanquished enemy.
Yes. His hut would be a symbol of our mightiness.
a mighty hut, huh? - Yeah.
well, it's not actually a hut, is it?
I just finished talking to Inger Johannsen's parents.
the girl never hurt a fly. - Oh, that's rough.
any way you cut the sandwich,
Ezra Krane knows something-- he's just not talking.
okay, well, you want me to bring him in?
you know me so well, cher.
threaten him with conspiracy and obstruction.
make the son of a bitch hurt; just don't leave any marks.
well, much as I'd like, you know, I'm not gonna be beating him up, Caroline.
I know, I know.
but a girl can dream, cher.
once we scan the bones, the computer can predict scenarios consistent with the damage?
Yeah. Now, these highlights...here, these indicate skeletal trauma.
now the program will compute trajectories.
cool. - Yeah.
so you two really thought that blowing up a scuba suit was gonna work, huh?
it did-- we determined that Inger Johannsen absolutely did not die from explosives shoved down her throat.
great.
okay, now the computer should tell us what caused the internal injuries.
a gunshot. - But there is no bullet.
Yeah, a contact gunshot without a bullet.
doesn't make any sense; what does that even mean?
whoa, whoa, whoa, wh-what just happened?
I think I smell something.
Oh, my God. No.
I can't wait to hear where this is going.
you're making my story better all the time.
who told you about the informant files?
he didn't give a name.
when did this mysterious source contact you? - Yesterday.
now, you called Sophia Berman and Chris Pelant.
it's almost like you knew everything before they did.
wait a minute. Suddenly I'm a person of interest here?
Oh, you're not interesting; you're just a suspect.
you've got nothing on me.
I know what your profile says, and I don't fit it.
you're smart enough to know that.
you needed a big story bad enough to make one.
if you're trying to scare me into naming my source, it's not gonna work.
I don't think you have a source.
I think you killed that girl in order to save your career.
where were you between the hours of 5: 00 and 6: 00 a. m.
when those remains were found in the museum?
alone in bed, asleep.
two weeks ago, the FBI had a blood drive-- where were you then?
at home writing. - Alone?
are you actually trying to pin this on me?
no, I'm just trying to catch a killer, and if it just so happens to be you, pal, that's just gravy.
okay, we figured out what killed her.
it's a bang stick. Divers use it for sharks.
that thing can kill someone?
okay. That's a yes.
the killer must have shoved it into her abdomen beneath the rib cage and fired.
Hey. So it turned out the malware killed our fans.
they're supposed to turn on when the CPU reaches 75 degrees, but the malware added a zero and made it 750.
how did this malware get past our firewall?
well, it didn't-- it originated in my computer.
wait, but it wouldn't have gotten in there unless you had downloaded something.
Yeah. Or uploaded.
all you uploaded were the scans of those bones.
are you telling me that there's a computer virus in the bones?
I have no idea how this happened, but it is the only explanation.
I need Dr. Brennan to look at the bones now.
these are all of the bones that you scanned into the computer?
Yeah. Wendell swears there's no microchips, nothing.
there's a roughness.
is it pitting from the fatal explosion?
I don't think so. Hand me the bottle of edicol dye and a brush.
Oh, my God.
what?
it's some kind of fractal pattern.
whoever did this wrote malware on bone that-that took down a million bucks' worth of computers.
who would know how to do that?
a computer genius who wants us to know that he doesn't need a computer.
Pelant. But he has an ankle monitor.
I'm telling you, this guy is a genius.
man walking his dog spotted him about an hour ago.
I wanted you to get the full effect.
okay, lower it down.
slowly, gently.
gently.
okay, let me guess. Security cameras were disabled?
you got it.
okay. You got him?
careful, careful.
he's got no face.
well, powder burns at the base of the skull are consistent with a bang stick, same thing that killed Inger Johannsen.
check his pockets, will you?
this is not the outcome I was hoping for... exactly.
how long has he been dead?
still warm. Less than four hours?
someone really didn't want Ezra Krane to reveal his source.
let's make sure we get secure transportation for this body.
well, we have fresh remains.
whoever did this-- we'll get him.
this is ridiculous.
the body left the scene over two hours ago.
I watched it get loaded onto the coroner's van myself.
should I call Caroline again?
you've already called her twice.
I got some very strange results back on the skull wound swab.
there's traces of thorium dioxide.
it's used in heat-resistant ceramics, like gas lamps and old vacuum tubes.
the same kind of vacuum tubes they use in old computers?
actually, yeah, now that you mention it.
didn't Booth say that Pelant had an old computer?
Yes, but he's also got that ankle monitor.
the killer made a cipher out of spine, and he wrote malware on bone, and-and he killed two people with blanks and a curtain rod.
I think he can get around an ankle monitor.
Pelant did this, Cam. He did it.
call Dr. Brennan.
your body won't be arriving any time soon.
Why?
the coroner's van left the scene with a Metro PD escort, but they got a radio call ordering them to reroute to the medical examiner's office, where there was paperwork ordering the body transferred to DC Memorial.
DC Memorial also had paperwork.
only theirs said that the autopsy was complete, and that infectious tissue was found.
Oh, my God. The protocol.
what? What protocol?
once autopsies are complete, bodies with infectious tissue are cremated as medical waste.
a set of orders were passed down through channels that even the Almighty Himself would need an atlas and a double shot of bourbon to navigate.
he thinks he's smarter than us.
he may be right.
I don't know anyone smarter than I am.
well, they didn't say that he was, just that he might be. Okay?
Pelant's parole officer's bringing him in, which is good.
he's resourceful.
that doesn't make him smarter than I am.
primitive hunters were resourceful.
Oh, you know, he did manage to get gunpowder for his bang stick without leaving tracks.
that's pretty resourceful.
he could have used putrefied urine.
it's an excellent source of potassium nitrate.
right. Oh, so you're saying that sometimes something that stinks has the potential to be turned into something
I don't know-- valuable?
are you talking about putrefied urine or a mighty hut?
both.
lot of trouble carting that thing in here.
why'd you do that, Agent Booth?
my guys took a look. Turns out there's a vacuum tube missing.
yeah? That's a drag. It's going to be tough to replace.
especially since I can't get online.
that seems like a pretty minor obstacle for a man who can write a computer virus on bone.
mm, mm, no, not virus.
the word you're looking for is "worm.
it's a common mistake.
so, you don't deny it.
why deny the impossible?
this sends a signal every 38 seconds to the monitoring company, and the records will show that I never left my house.
I talked to them. He's right.
you can charge me, you can charge me, but-but what jury is going to believe that
I killed a girl, cut her up, and then dumped her in the museum, all in 38 seconds?
you did it, but you couldn't have done it.
it's quantum indeterminacy.
I knew you'd say that.
I have a lot of time on my hands, so I've read all the court transcripts where you guys gave testimony.
you are not gonna get away with this, pal.
actually, it kind of looks like he is.
it's the giant flaw in our system.
trying to make the system secure, we make it more complex.
but the more complex we make it, the more insecure we actually are.
it turns out I'm not a complex guy.
I'm a simple guy, and simple guys always take down guys like you.
tell his guard he's ready to go.
Thanks.
give Jack Hodgins my regards.
I knew he'd enjoy the code in the spine.
we will get him, Booth.
it might take time, but he is not smarter than I am.
right.
just be careful in here, all right?
I don't want you to trip... Light around here somewhere-- I got it.
the mighty hut appears to be leaking.
I'll be able to patch that.
listen, I told you, this place needs a lot of work, so you have to use your imagination.
Oh, my God, Booth.
right. Uh, look, it's no big deal.
you know what? I can get my security deposit back.
it was only one month's salary. It's not gonna kill me.
you don't want to go over there.
that part kind of blew up.
it's where the marshals breached. I'm sorry.
this is a bad idea. I messed up.
it's perfect. - What?
I can see the bones, Booth. The bones of the house.
it's going to be wonderful.
you mean that?
the beams and the doorways appear to be structurally sound, and the proportions are very pleasing.
I can imagine it whole.
so can I.
there's a backyard, there's room for a swing... a tree house!
Where-Where's the baby's room?
Oh, you're gonna love it. Okay, it's this way.
be careful walking around, all right?
look, it's right here.
it's right next to our room, okay? So we can be close to her.
and we're gonna rip that wall out, and it's gonna be huge.
Oh, we could plant a cherry blossom tree outside the window.
anything. Yes, we can.
I-I already talked to Wendell, and he...
you know, he needs the work, so, we'll get this place in decent shape before this baby arrives.
we have a house, Booth.
you found our house.
we have a home.
Oh! Oh, could you feel that? She kicked!
I think she's trying to tell you that she likes her room.
you think? - Yeah.
Yes.
that devours everything else.
Dr. Brennan, Agent Booth, he's coming around. Hey, there, Michelangelo, you hear me?
you shouldn't call him that, Booth. If he had a head injury, he might think that's who he is.
something's poking in my back. And something smells terrible.
do you know your name?
Yes. Okay, what is it?
I'm not saying. Told you.
you confused him. No, I didn't.
look. - I'm not confused, I'm just not telling you my name.
see, he's not confused.
vitals are stable, no sign of concussion, but... Who are you?
who are we? FBI, that's who we are.
since when does FBI cover billboard vandalism?
I'd like to begin my examination. Ambulance guy says I'm okay.
well, she doesn't mean you. You're glued to decomposed human remains.
huh? - We're gonna flip you on the board.
okay, let's do it. - What?
you three grab the head. What's on me?
you two grab the feet. Easy on the neck, okay?
one, two, three.
this is weird. Easy on the shoulder.
take it slow.
What-what's on my back?
why is it sticking to him? Industrial strength adhesive.
I got it.
you know what, Bones, he was... he was standing up there, sticking that to that.
he tripped over his bucket. The buckets falls and he gets stuck. Right?
there's a dead dude stuck to my back?
bones, why can't we just, you know, peel them apart?
the adhesive has had ample time to adhere.
pulling them apart would rip off Michelangelo's skin, or worse, completely destroy the evidence.
worse than ripping off my skin? Well, this could certainly be cause of death.
what? - An anomalous projectile completed a transparietal trajectory.
why can't you just be simple? Arrow through the head. Murder.
insect and rat activity is indicated. We must be near an open sewer.
Oh, come on, man!
get it off of me!
after we get back to the lab. Yeah, it should give you and your new buddy some time to bond there.
we caught a good one. We've been over this.
there's no such thing as a good murder. Babe, I need your secret stash of peanut butter.
Hodgins, I bring in my peanut butter for a little comfort food every once in a while.
for comfort? Why? I got a ticket this morning.
speeding? No, I turned right on a red.
well, that's legal. Not at Broadway and Nash.
it's like a police trap over there.
they just wait, like fishermen after trout.
I think you mean like a deer hunter at a salt lick. Was there a sign?
there was one, but it was really small. Okay, well then, you definitely have to fight it.
Why? Because it's unfair.
now, come on, if you can give me the peanut butter, then the Jeffersonian will reimburse you.
shouldn't I just pay the fine and get on with my life?
what? Where is the spark plug that I married?
the spark plug you married conducted an unfettered sex life and never lived anywhere for more than a couple of years.
you want her back around? There's really no way to answer that without making you mad.
babe, peanut butter. Cover your eyes.
are we allowed to laugh?
no. Okay.
what are we calling the one that's still alive? Well, Booth calls him Michelangelo.
Michelangelo worked on commission. That's no kind of real artist.
Michelangelo's no kind of real artist. Good to know.
why won't you tell us your name? 'Cause I don't want you to know it.
kind of obvious, right?
large, rugged pelvis suggests the victim was a Caucasian male.
I have a large, rugged pelvis?
not you, the murder victim.
upper margin formation on the pubic synthesis indicates early 30s.
the victim's C5 and C6 vertebrae have been fused.
uncommon for someone that young.
hmm. If we find the doctor who performed the procedure, we can identify the victim.
how about the corpse that's trying to sodomize me? We have to separate Michelangelo and the corpse.
there we go. What about a laser?
no, no lasers. I-I agree with the smart and beautiful angel.
well, the smart and beautiful angel is gonna go find out who fused our victim's neck bones.
okay, fracture lines from the obscured region and onto the zygomatic, indicative of a perimortem trauma to the facial bones.
the arrow's clearly visible on either side of the victim's skull, but it didn't actually pierce it.
steve Martin? Michelangelo's real name is Steve Martin?
it's a gag. The ends of the arrows are connected to a plastic headband.
steve Martin? No?
it's a gag. Thus, irrelevant.
Mr. Fisher, find a way to separate Michelangelo and Steve Martin without damaging the evidence.
okay.
everyone here is this weird combo of smart and dumb.
Dr. Saroyan nixed the laser. I knew she would, which is why I brought this.
Oh, God, what did he bring? Peanut butter.
peanut butter? I'm not a piece of toast.
the oils in the peanut butter will break down the cohesion of the cyanoacrylates.
the glue will unstick. This guy's gonna rub me down with peanut butter?
Yep, and then cut off your clothes.
um... How's about she does that?
did you do that? No.
Oh, my God. You're-you're Zed.
no, I'm not. Y-You are.
you painted that. It's you.
the artist Zed? What's a Zed?
zed's a legend, mysterious street artist that nobody's ever met.
my name is Seth Zalinsky. Okay, well, at least we got his name out of him.
come on, this mook isn't the elusive and brilliant Zed.
look at him. I know my rights.
you can't just pin me down and slather peanut butter all over my private self.
what if we sedate you? Depends.
what do you got?
my name is ????????
I'm the manager of Tele-Com Inc. Telemarketing.
I filed a missing persons report on one of my employees, Morgan Donnelly, three days ago.
why is he talking like that? I don't know.
the company lawyer told me to speak clearly, tell the truth, and I'd have nothing to worry about.
right, well, you have one hell of a lawyer.
did you find, uh, Morgan? Yes, he is dead.
Donnelly's dead? Dead, dead?
we identified him by his neck operation. He was murdered.
Oh, my God, that can't be. How am I supposed to go on?
Donnelly's my heir apparent. I've been grooming him, and now I've got nobody.
what do you sell at Tele-Com? Everything.
last few weeks, we've been selling a time-share in Muncie, Indiana.
gateway to Indianapolis. And he could sell that?
Yeah, he can... could sell anything. Did anyone resent Donnelly?
enough to kill him? No.
did he have difficulty with anyone?
his girlfriend stormed into the office last Friday, hollered at him in front of everyone.
claimed he was cheating on her. Like she's one to talk.
are you implying that she herself was unfaithful?
implying? Hell, I'll say it directly.
she was a cheater. And how do you know?
she cheated on me with Donnelly. So, you're telling me that he stole your girlfriend.
wow, that really must have pissed you off. At first, but that was like, a year ago.
wait, am I a suspect? Most definitely.
I want to talk to the company lawyer.
in a sign of good faith, why don't you cough up the name and the address of the cheater girl?
I had to pry this peanut butter out of Angela's hands.
apparently, she needed the comfort of some smooth PB this morning after being caught making an illegal right on red.
Ah, police trap. Corner of Broadway and Nash.
been there, done that.
I feel... you know how when you wake up on Sunday morning, and you smell your mom making breakfast?
your dad's trying to make her dance to some ancient
tears for Fears song about shouting.
it's weird when the remains talk.
this is gonna work? Is that you, sweet chocolate angel?
Oh, my God. What did you give him?
some stuff for depression, mood swings, panic disorder...
okay. I don't want to know.
what I heard: cup of chamomile tea. - Good.
we're done. Okay.
you good for a few moments? I am good for eternity.
let's go.
you here for my sponge bath? That would be transcendent.
admit that Seth Zalinsky is not your only name.
well, in high school, they called me tripod.
Oh, now I'm very sad.
you did this. You're Zed.
zed is not my nickname. It's my alter ego.
much bigger deal. I'm very honored to meet you.
really. I mean, you are a wonderful, wonderful artist.
and you are really young, which is so much more impressive somehow.
I am totally babbling because I am starstruck. That's what it is.
you want to make out?
you know, time was I would have jumped you, but I'm a married woman now, so I'm just gonna kiss you because of who you are.
okay?
I felt something move. Don't ruin my moment.
on my back. I think the dead guy's separating.
you know, you really didn't have to come. You said you wanted me to come with you.
where are we going? We're gonna go talk to the hollering, cheating girlfriend.
no, I mean, my Prius has a voice-activated navigation system.
Oh, 709 Windsor Drive. Enter an address.
709 Windsor Drive.
searching. Now you don't have to unfold and refold a map.
wait a second. I like maps. What's wrong with maps?
well, maps cannot tell you the amount of traffic you should expect en route to your destination.
look at that. See? Now we can relax, talk about interesting things.
this is not how the cowboys settled this country. The cowboys didn't have antibiotics.
do you also want to die from a skinned knuckle? Sometimes.
Alexa! The FBI wants to talk to you!
you know, you shouldn't feel bad about living with your sister.
the current trend of delaying marriage, along with the economy means that people have to adapt.
however, it does complicate the sex life.
tell me about it.
Hey, I'm Alexa. Can I help you guys with something?
like to ask you a few questions about Morgan Donnelly. Here we go.
I'm afraid he's dead. Of course he is.
did he get crushed by a falling anvil or something?
no, that is not correct.
we believe you had an altercation with him a few days ago.
I find their upbeat demeanor highly suspicious. This is a serious situation. He may have been murdered.
Oh! Murdered!
okay, careful, Mr. Fisher. It's his hair, that's all.
Ah! There we go.
it is with great pleasure that I divorce these skulls.
massive blunt-force trauma to the facial bones.
the victim's skull is totally smashed in. Did I do that when I fell on him?
cause I didn't do it on purpose.
no, the fracture lines on the zygomatic bones indicate the trauma was sustained around time of death.
which was five days before you fell on him.
whoa, whoa, wait, there could be... Whoa!
...blowflies.
that explains the constant buzzing.
you are a very calm young man. Pharmaceutically enhanced calm.
third instar larvae.
the victim die five days ago.
five days ago was Friday. The same day the victim's girlfriend accused him of cheating.
God, it's so weird when they move. That felt good.
almost as good as when that Asian chick kissed me. Wait.
what? That Asian chick kissed me.
let's clean Mr. Zalinsky up, and in some kind of clothes.
Oh, come... I already slathered him with peanut butter, plied him with pharmaceuticals, now I got to give him a sponge bath?
what Asian chick did you kiss?
the FBI really call in a psychiatrist because I laughed?
now you all think I'm some sort of psychopath?
I'm actually a psychologist, Ms. Eaton.
but, um, yes, Agent Booth called me because he was struck by your sudden mood swing.
I'm not a psycho! Can you tell me how you feel about Morgan Donnelly's death?
um, I'm very upset! Look at me.
can you tell me why you laughed?
because I thought it was another one of Morgan's practical jokes.
he was a joker? Yes.
and I thought it was his way of totally making up after our fight.
what fight? A girl walked up and kissed him.
I figured he didn't need to enjoy it so much. A girl just walked up and kissed him?
Yeah, right on the lips. Some tongue action, too. She recognized him.
what? I was not aware that telemarketers attracted that kind of notice.
morgan was a comedian, okay?
the telemarketing gig, it was just temporary.
okay, that explains the fake arrow through his head.
morgan had an amazing sense of humor. Girls like that in a guy.
Yeah, I always thought that that was... a lie.
so, was Morgan's sense of humor the reason why you left his boss?
look, if you met Denny, you'd know why I went for Morgan.
you think Denny could have killed Morgan out of jealousy? After a year?
even Denny thinks faster than that. Okay, and when was the last time you saw Morgan?
he came over for dinner that same night, Friday.
and then I went to work. I'm a bartender.
you can check that out. Sure.
and then, when I came home, Morgan wasn't there.
I didn't kill Morgan. I loved him.
you know who you should be looking for? Whoever put that arrow gag on his head.
that wasn't his? No way!
he hated that shtick stuff. His material was cerebral.
you wouldn't by any chance have footage of Morgan's stand-up?
my brother, Elliot, recorded every show.
Mr. Fisher, if we are to determine the murder weapon, it is of the uttermost importance that the remains be clean.
Dr. Hodgins has a plan.
I don't know if you're aware, but I do a bit of stand-up myself.
I imagine you are not very skilled at it as you are not a humorous person.
my routine is dark, disturbing and uncomfortable. Just the way a comedy show should be.
notice the large number of chips and fragments.
also how the chip itself is fragmented?
huh. One blow created the chip, a second or a third shattered it again.
the victim was struck in the face several times with a blunt object.
do you find that amusing? Amusing? No.
darkly illuminating in a manner which allows us to laugh defiantly into the yawning abyss?
that's hilarious. I'm sorry, I'm trying to see the hilarity, but all I see is a man who was beaten in the face until he died.
sorry.
Hey, hey, did you get anything off the laughing girlfriend?
Oh, Alexa Eaton and her brother laughed because they thought you and Dr. Brennan were a prank.
Oh, there's your motive for murder right there: practical jokes.
I mean, hey, everybody, you know, they hate practical jokers.
the victim was a stand-up comedian. Well, that would explain, you know, the arrow through the head.
the killer might have been another stand-up. Where would you get that?
well, the arrow on the head could have been placed there as a mark of derision. You know, an insult.
whoa, whoa. Why? That's a funny bit.
Yeah, it's a classic. Uh, so I went through some of Morgan Donnelly's stand-up routine, came up with some interesting clues and insights.
arrow through the head, that's a... that's a funny gag.
Yeah, is, was, and always will be.
let me know when you want to hear the rest of my insights.
I have visual aids. Okay, great. I laugh out loud all the time I see that.
the arrow through the head. It's funny.
who did all this stuff? Uh, what are you doing here?
they told me I could sleep on the couch. Did you paint this?
Yes. Yes, those are mine.
why are you in my office? I don't know.
I think they roofied me. It was pretty great.
I do remember your husband was peeved that you kissed me.
Oh, yeah. Let me worry about Hodgins.
middle-class, suburban hang-ups and sexual values.
what are you, like, 19?
Oh, so you think my idealistic approach to art is adolescent?
but it looks to me like you used to have some ideals of your own.
before you got married, had a baby, started painting...
what the hell is that supposed to be?
do you want me to call you a cab or...
no, I can find my own way. I have since I was an adolescent.
you're the only person in the world who knows my secret identity.
okay, Batman.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone.
let me guess, you're keeping it pure, right?
you want to make it about the art and not about the artist.
some things are easy to make fun of.
doesn't mean they're not important.
I'll make you a deal. You keep your lips zipped, and tonight, I'll take care of Broadway and Nash.
okay, your secret is safe with me.
you have excellent...
technique
know what else is completely made up?
general anxiety disorder.
Yeah, you know what this is? It's called "life.
that's exactly what you need to do; get a life!
sir, if I've said anything to offend you, please, please know that I am delighted.
that heckler can be heard on several of the tapes.
every single time, Donnelly humiliates him in front of the crowd.
how many times you hear the same heckler? About a dozen, and I haven't even been through all the tapes.
is that normal? One heckler, time after time?
I asked Fisher. Fisher the intern?
fisher the comic? Fisher's funny?
not at all. He's kind of an underground sensation, though.
it's brilliant. Fisher said it's not normal.
if anyone knows heckling, it's Fisher. Okay, how do we ID the heckler?
easy. His name's Larry Baron. He's another comic, crappy. Him and Morgan hated each other.
why didn't you just tell me that? You didn't ask.
fine. Where can we find him? He's the bartender at Laughtastic's.
Laughtastic's, great. So, why did you tape all of Morgan Donnelly's stand-up routines?
he was my sister's boyfriend. He hired me.
he was my mentor, and I fed him lots of good ideas.
he said I was his muse.
not in a creepy sex way or anything. It was in a funny way.
any way you think you could introduce me to Fisher?
probably not 'cause of the murder investigation, huh?
is it too weird?
you're gonna get dermestid beetles in my peanut butter.
the beetles will eat what's left of the victim's flesh.
and for peanut butter, nothing beats Gromphadorhina portentosa, aka the Madagascar hissing cockroach.
so, this victim, did you ever hear of him? He was a popular comic.
sure sign you've transgressed the unwritten rule of comedy.
I thought the only rule in comedy was to be funny.
tragically, you're not the only one who thinks that way.
well, if you ask me, it gets no better than the Stooges.
unfettered psychopathic violence!
hilarious, right? Not really, when you put it that way.
might I recommend, next time, watching with the volume turned off?
the absence of the cartoon sound effects makes it much more violent.
Yeah, I know Morgan Donnelly. Uh, you going to order a drink, or what?
Yeah, we'll have some water. Must be tough on a guy like you, huh?
serving drinks, has to watch other comedians on stage do their thing...
are you kidding?
that's like telling a Jew he doesn't want to be in Mecca.
in point of fact, Mecca is the center of the Muslim world.
it would be completely rational for a Jew to avoid Mecca.
especially during hajj. Yeah, I'm fine.
so... okay? Morgan Donnelly's dead.
Yeah, I heard that. It's terrible.
is it true that he told you, in front of a crowd, that if he wanted to hear from an ass, he would have farted?
Yeah. He did say that.
he got a huge laugh, too.
we have proof that he humiliated you at least 20 times in front of audiences. What?
I get it. No, that wasn't a joke.
I know it wasn't a joke. I know what is a joke and what isn't a joke.
I'm not sure you do.
now, don't heckle him, Bones. He might want to kill you next.
Oh, you got it all wrong.
look, me and Morgan... it was a setup.
setup? He wanted you to heckle him?
Definitely! Definitely.
all those lines that he used on me? You know, like the fart one?
or he's say, um... "There's an alcoholic who should stay anonymous.
I wrote all those. Why?
it was my way of, uh, getting laughs.
bonus, it made the audience like Morgan, you know, so it's a... it's a win-win situation.
right. Well, thanks for your cooperation.
come on. Booth.
yeah? The man in this flyer has a fake arrow through his head.
Oh. Yeah. That's Rex.
and let me tell you, now that Donnelly is gone, he's gonna get the Friday night slot, so... that's got to make you suspicious, right?
you comedians really stick together, huh?
this could very well be the murder weapon. Where's Rex now?
who stole it? Could've been anyone.
that bit is classic. I think... I think so, too.
it is funny.
but my prime suspect: a so-called comic, so-called Morgan Donnelly.
okay, why do you think he stole it? Guy's a natural thief-- props, jokes, women.
he steals it all. He's dead.
murdered. Sorry to say, that was bound to happen.
you really do hate this guy, huh? Both personally and professionally, yes.
Rex's mallet tested positive for blood. Positive for what?
blood. Now, that's funny.
Yes, I kissed him.
Why?
it wasn't a you-me kind of kiss.
this was a musty old auntie kiss.
yeah? Well, your musty old auntie kiss is the best kiss that kid ever got.
why are you being jealous? Because he's... cool.
you know? And I'm... not.
and, I don't know, if you ever leave me, it's gonna be for someone who's cool.
cool" isn't really a thing anymore.
thank you for proving my point.
you still haven't told me why you kissed him.
Yeah, I...
I promised him I wasn't gonna tell anybody, and...
I will tell you, though, because you are not just anybody.
I kissed him because he's a great artist.
and his art is changing the world.
he's Zed.
well, it's hard to argue with that. You know what he said about my work?
he said that I have... "excellent technique.
well, that's great. No. No, honey, it's not great.
well, "excellent" usually means great.
Brennan's got the murder weapon. Okay, listen, just...
no more kissing any artists, or anyone else, for that matter.
yeah? Are we good?
Yes, honey, we are good. You know why?
because I have excellent technique.
which is not good.
exactly.
ready?
just reinserting the last few pieces of dentition.
speaking of which,
I found some slivers of tooth in some flesh that might have been a part of the victim's stomach.
bashed in the teeth, swallowed the fragments? Makes sense to me.
so let's hear it.
excuse me? You're a comedian, right?
can I hear one of your jokes? Oh, I don't do jokes, Dr. Saroyan.
I do raw, unfiltered honesty.
let me hear some raw, unfiltered honesty, then.
as you wish.
I am incapable of truly loving another human being.
for that reason, I will never sire an heir.
okay. Well, then.
we have a tad too much tooth.
are you still doing your comedy here, or...?
no. No, you literally have too much tooth. Hold the laughs.
this is not tooth.
I'm back to my day job now, Dr. Saroyan. You don't have to laugh.
what's that? - Visual aid.
joke one: "I love to brag about how modest I am.
that's not funny. Mm-mm. But it is both self-centered and self-deprecating.
joke number two: "I dated a 14-year-old once...
but I was 14, too, so it wasn't a big deal.
okay, wait, so you're saying that our victim was a self-centered, self-deprecating child abuser? No, no, no.
I'm saying that joke one and joke two weren't written by the same person.
how can you tell?
well, the notion of taking a subject as disturbing as pedophilia, turning it on its head, to create something as sweet and innocent as young love tells me that this joke was probably written by a woman.
Hmm-mm. Mr. Cantaloupe said our victim stole the jokes.
I agree. Okay, how does a comedian do that?
fisher says that open mike nights are the best place to steal fresh jokes.
okay? Now, Laughtastic's has an open mike night.
and Donnelly was a judge. Great.
I'll just go there and get the information. Thanks.
fisher again. You go to the open mike night.
you tell some of the jokes I've marked as stolen. See if anyone gets mad.
why me? Well, because...
I have to keep an eye out for subtle reactions from the audience, and Fisher's too well-known.
he and I have written some original jokes for you.
you pepper in some of the stolen stuff, see if anyone lays claim to them.
you and Fisher wrote me a comedy routine? Okay.
the blue jokes I wrote, all right? The yellow ones, stolen.
the black ones...
Fisher. Yep.
you have about a half an hour. What?
is it just me, or are circles pointless?" What?
multiple radiating fracture lines originating on the glabella, terminated by fracture lines on the maxilla.
just as we suspected, multiple blows.
I come bearing bad news.
the mallet was not the murder weapon. Why was there blood all over it?
false positive, from the peroxidase enzyme found in turnip juice.
I hate to think how many turnips this man bludgeoned to death.
what about Dr. Saroyan's fragments? Ceramic.
let's have Angela recreate the fracture pattern on the Angelatron.
okay, I'll let her know.
okay! All right, uh, let's give it up...
are you nervous? I've had people try to kill me, Sweets.
how could cracking jokes make me nervous?
just remember to look relaxed, as though you own the stage. Stop with the advice.
just, please? Okay, Fisher's here.
if it looks like you're in trouble, he'll heckle you.
why are you making such a big deal about this? Welcome to the stage for the first time...
Seeley, not Cee-Lo.
what do you ?????????
so...
good evening. Thanks for coming out tonight.
you know who has a lot of great ideas? Lamps.
I hate my father. I mean, not for what he's done to me, but for what he hasn't done to me.
laugh. Laugh at the emptiness of my pain.
is it just me, or are circles pointless?
so far this act is pointless.
all right, pal, you want to quit shooting your mouth off before I shoot it off for you.
Oh, my God, Booth is funny. Almost funny.
I once shot an unarmed man. I mean, sure, I shot off both of his arms, but still.
so I was at the trial, and the prosecutor says to me on the stand, "Did you kill that man?" I said, "No.
he says, "You know what the penalty for perjury is?" I said, "Yeah, it's a lot less than the penalty for murder.
why-why am I even here?
fine.
so, uh... well, how about the guy who invented tanning beds?
I mean, the nerve! Who looks at the sun and says, "Hey, I can do better.
I went to a cello recital the other night. It was... it was a solo show.
meaning I was the only person in the audience.
even I don't get that one. Nobody likes a cello.
it's just a violin with size issues, which is also a joke I wrote, like the others that you stole.
FBI, you're coming with me.
Annie Pinkus. Right.
so. Quite a coincidence that you work at the same place as the murder victim.
two comedians, working a telemarketing day job?
Yeah. Bizarre coincidence there.
were you having an affair with Morgan Donnelly?
no. Why?
it says here Donnelly's girlfriend comes in ripping him a new one about a third woman.
maybe you didn't know about either one of them. Twice the jealousy, twice the motive?
three times. See, he was stealing your jokes.
he deserved to die. I was not sleeping with Morgan, and he was not stealing my jokes.
well, I told a couple of your jokes. You accused me of stealing.
Yeah, Morgan bought my jokes.
$25 a pop plus a piece of the back end deal if he went on Letterman,
HBO, you know, whatever.
I could see why you didn't want to save those jokes for yourself.
I'm not funny. I write funny, but I'm not funny.
some people are funny, like you.
others, like me, we do better off writing for the funny people.
so, you expect me to believe that Morgan Donnelly's death hurt your career.
hells yeah. He was about to move to New York, do comedy full time.
is this the real deal or was this just the pipe dream? For reals.
he had bookings-- TV shows, clubs. You can check it out.
look, what you think is a motive for me to murder is actually the complete opposite of a motive for murder.
that's irony, and it's definitely not funny. Capisce?
so, after pulling out the postmortem damage that was caused by Zalinsky's skull,
I used the intersections of the radiating fracture lines to determine that the facial trauma was actually a result of three separate blows.
here are the results of the initial blow.
it appears that the force of this blow and the force of the blow that broke the victim's metacarpals are nearly identical.
the weapon is the same one that broke his metacarpals.
please bring up the results of the second blow.
um, fracturing to the dentition, mandible, maxilla, and zygomatic bones.
the killer either picked up a larger weapon to finish the job or he swung a lighter weapon with greater force.
well, here are the results of the third blow.
okay, I-I'm sorry. I know what this looks like to you, but this entire sequence here, I-it's The Three Stooges.
it's classic comedy in three blows.
I mean, the weapon is gonna be a frying pan.
this strike caused fragments of the glabella to pierce the victim's brain.
death blow.
which is not funny. No, it's not.
based on the amorphous wound pattern, the murder weapon is curved upon its horizontal axis.
curved, ceramic, like a large vase?
Angie, I just sent you the results of the core sample I took from the shard of ceramic.
was it a vase? Not unless it was a vase full of urine.
it's a toilet? Ding-ding-ding.
and the prize goes to the little lady wearing the blue lab coat.
sorry, yeah, I-I got excited.
so, his head was smashed into a toilet? Classic.
the first blow occurred when the victim had his hand on the edge of the toilet.
his face was smashed into his hand. Comedian was killed by a brutal swirly?
so, he was draped over the toilet, puking, when he was killed.
I'm... swirly.
so, how many toilets are there in the Metro D. C. area?
Oh, uh, approximately five and a half million. How is that you know that?
there is approximately one toilet per person in the United States of America.
do you want me to figure out how much time it would take to inspect each toilet?
no, we don't have to do that.
why not? Why?
I'll just get, you know, a warrant for all the toilets that the victim used regularly, and we'll start with that.
and when I say "we," I mean Hodgins.
one million, two hundred and fifty thousand man-hours. W-What?
that's how long it would take to check out every toilet in D. C. Once you start with the math, you don't stop, right?
I think everyone's like that, don't you? Yeah, I think so, definitely.
go math! Math people forever, right?
tell us about the last time you saw Morgan Donnelly. I already told the other young man.
I made him dinner here. What did you make?
beef stroganoff. Salad, ice cream.
did you feel well afterwards? Yes, I went to work.
I was fine. The FBI checked out my alibi.
you already know. Was Morgan feeling all right when you left the house?
he was fine. He and Elliot were gonna watch some soccer game and write jokes about it.
did your brother mention feeling sick the next morning?
Why? Do you think my cooking killed Morgan? We have evidence that Morgan became ill that night.
it's very likely that he died while vomiting into your toilet.
Oh, my God, do you really think that I poisoned Morgan to death?
no. Morgan Donnelly died by someone smashing his head into the toilet bowl.
I want a lawyer.
and I want one for my brother.
morgan was moving to New York. That's not true.
what made him vomit? He was drinking a lot, you know, to work up the courage.
courage for what? Tell my sister he was going to dump her and take off.
you didn't know any of this? So, it was a matter of defending your sister's honor?
not only. I did all that work with Morgan and taped him.
he was supposed to helping me put my own act together, but he wasn't gonna.
he said something like, a comic has to be tough, make tough calls, and leave behind people he'd outgrown.
he's sitting there telling me all this stuff with a stupid arrow in his head.
I got mad and...
poor Elliot.
I...
did what I did.
then I wrapped him up in a shower curtain, drove him out to that woodsy area under the billboard.
came back, cleaned up the bathroom, put the shower curtain back up and...
okay, he's here, he's here, he's here.
what if he hates it? Angela, it's okay.
he's leaving.
forget it.
okay.
man, shut up, okay?
do married people tell each other everything?
why didn't you paint something? Somebody beat me to it, man.
I got nothing better to say than she did.
you mean, you-you like it? I love it.
but your technique blows.
Hey, you can't you talk to her... Hodgins...
...it was a compliment.
sweets told me that you were really funny at the comedy club. Oh, he wrote me some jokes.
no, he said that you bombed when you told his jokes, but that the audience laughed when you got mad.
wait a second, all right. You're the one who said that comedy comes out of anger.
I have been a very good influence on the sophistication of your thinking.
I'm a very sophisticated man.
laughter can also be made to make people helpless and vulnerable.
perhaps that's why some comics say, "I killed tonight.
or, "I slaughtered them.
Side-splitting. Yes.
exactly, humor is a kind of viol... Oh, my God. Don't move.
you have an arrow in your head. No, Bones, it's a joke.
I'm sorry. It was just...
you tried to scare me, but I scared you right back.
that is funny. I was trying to make you laugh, okay?
and then you scared me. All right, that's not funny.
you and Sweets, you're not funny. Wh... Really?
well, will you tell me one of Sweets' jokes? Okay, fine.
you know who's good ideas?
who? Lamps.
lamps... yes.
Yes, yes, lamps have good ideas because they lightbulbs going on.
that's not funny. That's really... it's really funny, Booth.
one more, tell me another. Okay, fine, is it just me or are circle pointless?
sweets is a genius.
circles are pointless because they are round.
get it? One more, Booth.
pointless.
Habitat's just over those hills.
who doesn't like to come into town for a nice meal every now and then, hmm?
I thought this job was about dogs and cats. Well, it's just like a cat, named Bob.
look, bobcats are more scared of us than we are of them.
Oh, my God. There it is.
wait till you see the teeth on these suckers.
come on, come on. Hey, hey.
you can always get laid with a story about catching a bobcat.
now slowly go behind the Dumpster.
I DID
I-I got him! Okay, now hand him over.
get a sample of what he was feeding on, in case he gets sick.
hurry up!
there's a lot of stuff here. If he craps in this van, you're cleaning it up.
I got it. He was feeding on this.
okay... and now you're going to learn about paperwork.
this is the third letter I've gotten from a collection agency.
they probably just mixed you up with someone else.
no, they all have my Social Security number, correct address...
but I know I didn't buy a portable tool shed for $1, 800.
it's nice, riding in together. Easier than going back to separate places.
that was subtle.
and now that you have that tool shed, we'd have plenty of room.
Oh, man, now what? With this car, it could be anything.
Hey! I got the taillight fixed, and the exhaust. Well, you definitely weren't speeding.
I don't think you could in this thing.
license and registration, sir.
ma'am. Of course.
excuse me, Officer, can I ask why you pulled us over?
doesn't really concern you, ma'am.
why don't you sit back while your boyfriend does what I asked?
Boyfriend"? Okay.
I think it's pretty clear why you pulled us over. Cam.
he was driving erratically, ma'am. Uh, no, he was driving while brown.
let it go, Cam. No.
I'd listen to him, ma'am. What is it?
did you do a little time in the Middle East, maybe? You didn't like the way he looked?
or maybe me? I. D. ma'am.
Oh, seriously? - Now!
I am the Head of the Forensic Division at the Jeffersonian Institution.
and I am on my way to a case, so... Let it go. It's a stupid ticket.
no. I will not let something like this go, and neither should you.
you know there's a fine line... Warrants outstanding for check fraud, - credit card fraud and grand theft-- arrest on sight. - ...be allowed to pull you over for no reason?
out of the car!
what? - Out of the car.
now. Oh! Oh, my God...
what is going on? What the hell is going on?
Camille Saroyan, step out of the car. What?
turn around and step away from the car, please.
okay.
you're under arrest for check and credit card fraud, and grand theft.
what? No, there must be some mistake.
I'd stay out of this if I were you, buddy.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, an attorney will be appointed for you...
look, I can't believe anyone would think she was capable of check fraud.
of course she's capable. What are you talking about?
I don't believe she did it. But she certainly has the intellectual acumen for it.
okay. You definitely should not be a character witness.
no hazardous waste accepted... What is this?
wow, bobcat feast.
judging by the use of debris to cover the remains between feedings, our victim's been here at least six hours.
Hey, is Cam out of the hoosegow yet?
Yeah, I called in a favor, had the bail hearing moved up.
she should be out in a few hours. Whoa, hello.
puncture marks on the head of the humerus indicate that the bobcat severed the arms from the body.
what's that smell? - Oh, yeah.
Bobcats? They mark their feeding area with urine and, if you're lucky, feces.
look, was this guy alive when he was ripped apart? I mean, is this something we should be even involved in?
if Dr. Saroyan wasn't incarcerated, she'd note that the decomposition of this tissue indicates that the victim was dead six to 12 hours before the bobcat started feeding.
so it was a body dump. Have you found the skull, Dr. Hodgins?
no...
Bobcats often carry their food into trees to consume it.
well, there we go.
Yep. Our animal friends are so predictable.
feces.
it's your lucky day, Bug Boy.
awesome.
the extensive number of fractures evident on these X-rays indicate blunt force trauma as cause of death.
Yeah, lots of blunt force and lots of trauma, by the looks of it.
and completed ossification of the clavicle indicates the victim was in his early 30s, and...
Arastoo? Yeah, sorry.
I'm still...
it was like Cam was daring the cop to bust her.
was the cop racist? You could take it that way, yeah.
racism is racism. Right, sweetie?
Oh. I have found, as a Caucasian, if I enter into any kind of debate like this, the non-Caucasians, like you and Arasto, yell at me, as if I represent all white people.
I tend to represent all Muslims. I tend to represent all hot women.
I don't know if you can classify "hot women" as a race. Excuse me?
I'm about to breach security, so if one of you could...
what's wrong with your card? The same thing that's wrong with my credit cards, my bank card, the reason why my online stock trading account's been frozen...
you trade in the stock market? No.
apparently, I've been the victim of identity theft.
you got arrested because someone else broke the law?
using my identity, yes. And it's still happening.
but I really don't want to deal with this at work, so let's drop it, okay?
what do you mean, it's still happening?
until they catch whoever stole her identity, they can...
this is not dropping it.
the brain seems to be the only organ that the bobcat didn't get at.
okay, with all this damage, the facial reconstruction is gonna take a while.
the victim has areas of very dense bone around his pelvis and vertebral spine.
also, calcification of the lateral and medial collateral ligaments.
skeletal fluorosis? How is that possible?
there's no evidence of bone deformation. Early stages.
and extremely rare in North America.
any diagnosed cases would be reported to the Department of Public Health.
very good, then, Mr. Vaziri.
if our victim sought treatment in the U. S. it means he's registered.
Hey. Sweets. Got an identity on the victim.
he was single, right? His clothes and his lack of ring...
married. Blue collar?
management consultant. Also, Korean.
I got everything wrong? Well, you know what?
not everything. I mean, you did say that he was a guy.
okay? Come on, you know, everybody has a bad day. You know what you do?
you just gotta walk it off, all right, buddy? Get back in the game.
is there anything in the missing persons database? Nope.
so, then, why didn't his wife report him missing?
well, that's your department. Come on, let's go! Get into it.
it's time to, you know, regain your self-respect...
Oh, look at that. Noodle soup.
asian Noodle Fun." That's good.
wait, those are my noodles. They're mine now.
Adam's... dead?
are you sure it's him?
God, I can't... oh... You'll be all right.
just deep breaths, in and out. What's wrong with her?
well...I think we'll find that Mrs. Pak suffers from a panic disorder, am I correct?
no, I'm just trying not to cry.
okay, when was the last time you saw your husband? Three days ago.
he left on a business trip to Thailand.
he was a management consultant. Yes.
um, lots of international clients, so he... he travels a lot.
did you speak to him while he was away?
last night. - I bet he calls you every night when he's away, doesn't he?
no, I called him.
any reason why you would call him?
I heard someone downstairs.
I thought it was Adam, so I called to make sure.
he told me I was imagining things, like always.
and then h-he hung up and I called the security company.
I bet they told you that you were right to call, though.
no, they think I'm crazy nervous.
I called them three or more times during the night. Mrs. Pak, you realize that your husband, he wasn't killed in Thailand.
he was found here in the United States.
can you think of any reason, you know, I don't know, why he would lie to you?
I mean, he must have had a good reason.
but you were here all of last night?
like I told you. If you don't believe me, ask the security company.
what will I do without Adam?
what do you got? Advice about identity theft.
Thanks, but no thanks.
I found traces of agricultural lime on the victim's clothing.
I'm guessing you're not talking about a fruit.
it's a substance used to make acidic soil more habitable for plants.
how common is it? It's fairly common.
and a recent study in Tennessee showed that the presence of agricultural lime actually increases bobcat visitation rates.
so the lime attracted the bobcat to his remains.
there are warrants out for your arrest. Your credit score's gonna flat line.
you're not gonna be able to get money out of an ATM, your assets are going to end up being frozen...
I also found Chironomidae from the nematoceran fly family...
and soil.
soil with a... it's a very high acidic ratio and greater clay subsoil component.
can you cross-reference? Seriously?
there's only one place where these both coexist...
it's on Native American tribal land in Virginia.
our Korean victim was killed on an Indian reservation?
your wages will be garnished. You need a lawyer.
I'm pretty sure I can handle this on my own. Cam.
you got blocked from the forensic platform. You need a lawyer.
and one that's gonna trust you because he trusts me.
thank you.
thank you.
if I leave now, you're not gonna come up with another clue, are you?
I'm all out.
I should probably leave before Booth gets home.
Yes, you should. Really?
Angela, you're being very mean to him.
anger is a reasonable response. Why aren't you mad at him?
I mean, he forces you to propose to him, he accepts, and then he changes his mind. He has his reasons.
yeah? What reasons? I don't know.
then why aren't you angry at him?
I don't know why Mars lost its magnetic field.
I'm not angry at Mars.
that's fine, I'll be angry at both Booth and Mars for you.
awkward.
Bye, sweetie.
Bye.
good-bye. That's the best word I've heard all day.
so, part of the Indian tribal land is being leased to a company called New Dawn Retreat.
what's that? It's a marriage retreat.
get this, okay?
one of the registered couples was under the name of Adam and Kelly Pak.
but the victim's wife was at home and... her name is Emma.
getting permission for the FBI to go onto tribal land that takes months, you know?
and this marriage retreat is over in two days.
by that time, any witnesses will have left the retreat.
and possibly the killer. So, you know what I'm thinking?
undercover. Yeah.
buck and Wanda. Not Buck and Wanda.
yeah? This is a job for...
Tony and Roxie. Yeah!
okay, you've got it, big boy! How you doing, baby?
Yeah, how you doing? No, no, no, it's-it's, "How you doing?
how ya doin'? No, you're using your nose too much.
you'll be joining our introductory group;
people like yourselves who are finally brave enough to confront their problems.
Oh, no, no, we got no problems. Oh, we got problems, Tony.
what are you talking about? Come on...
slow down. I think we fit pretty good in all the right places, huh?
without opening your hearts and letting love bathe the pain, you'll never grow to the oneness you need to flourish.
look at them. Look how united they are.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Everybody, slow down!
we don't have to do any of that stuff, huh? That's an advanced course.
those couples have already taken both the introductory and intermediate sessions.
they got problems, you know advanced problems.
well, lots and lots of money for you, I imagine, Mr. Little River.
all right, take it easy on him, okay, Roxie?
listen, the guy's trying to run a business. He likes helping people.
all feeling and no brains, this one.
the majority of the money goes back into the facility and for research into the psycho-structure of interpersonal relations.
okay, one thing I don't understand is this guy right here.
then perhaps you use your head too much...
slow down.
...and your heart not enough.
you know, he makes a good point.
Seriously? Just saying, Bones.
Seriously?! Okay, stop-- just keep the act up, will ya?
hemorrhagic staining on the inside of the frontal bone.
perimortem fractures to the skull, ribs, pelvis and the proximal end of both femurs.
brittle bones.
that would account for the severity of the fractures.
making it hard to determine the true force with which he was struck.
which makes it tough to determine what he was hit with.
damn. The manager at my bank can't help.
he's gonna have to freeze all the accounts until this is worked out.
and your credit cards? All canceled. All of them.
what about Hodgins' lawyer? I didn't think I'd need him.
why do you always refuse help?
you need him. And I'll give you some money until...
no, thank you. But I can take care of this myself.
cam... No.
okay. So I guess you won't let me pay for dinner either.
can I at least suggest a Dumpster that you might enjoy, behind the supermarket?
I never should have brought this up at work.
of course not. That's for normal people.
I just, I need to focus on the case. Something I can control.
you understand.
I do. So?
okay... so here's what I got so far.
based on the angles of the segmented fracture in the left femur,
I realized there's a dual directionality to the victim's injuries.
basically, he was smacked from one direction and then smacked from the other direction almost simultaneously.
so, two assailants? That complicates things.
Yeah. That should take your mind off your problems for a while.
we're supposed to be doing our exercises even if Shaman Little River isn't here.
he said. So you're the perfect one, like always.
word of advice, pet, if you want to live to our age, take a breath.
what, you think we make 72 look good?
well, maybe you're in your 70s, old man, but I am...
look, the boys have got marriage problems, Evelyn. They're not blind.
everyone, this is Tony and Roxie Scallion.
how you doing? How you doing?
how's it going, eh? How are ya?
what's your problem, kids? Too beautiful?
Oh, thank you. You flatter.
we talked about your hostility, Evelyn. Yeah, good luck with that.
Oh, thank you, Shaman. Kelly and Adam Pak aren't here.
I went to their tent to check, but wanted to start anyway, like you said.
of course he did.
the world would stop spinning if you weren't a good boy.
his behavior has nothing to do with the rotation of the earth, doll.
I like her. So, who are the Paks?
Oh, they make all of us look happily married. Let's not worry about other people, Evelyn.
whoa, slow down, okay? Didn't you say that we could learn from each other, okay?
what were their problems? Kelly thought Adam was holding something back from her.
and I agree. He had secrets. You could tell.
everyone has something they're afraid to tell their partner.
but if you find the courage to open up, it's always for the best.
Tony has secrets from me. What?
that must be very painful for you. Really?
Ah! What is it, Tony, getting a little something on the side?
okay, all right, you know what? We don't have to start with me first.
Oh, no, no, no. Out with it, Tony.
come on, huh? I have a secret that I'll share.
that's beautiful. Thank you.
I never told you how much I dislike it when you wear that beer hat in the bath.
you look foolish, and sometimes it makes me think that I married a child.
you're kidding me right? No, Tony, I ain't.
we'll talk about the hat after you lose that stupid African fertility statue out of the bedroom.
you know what? - SERIOUSLY?
on top of it, you know, you should cut off his...
we don't use anger here. But it's an exquisite carving.
I find it inspirational.
I love this girl. In my experience...
petty issues like this usually mask a larger secret.
like the money you don't tell me you spend.
Oh, my God. Once!
that was one time. And you love the canoe!
so don't, don't start. Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I am so, so, so sorry I'm late.
that's okay. Where's Adam, Kelly?
I don't know.
we got into a huge fight last night, and he just ran off.
I've been calling and calling, but he's not answering. Because it's finished.
I'll take her picture so we can I. D. her. Maybe we should call the cops.
I've seen this a hundred times. Working on a relationship is a difficult thing.
and you both have tempers, lovey. He'll be back.
until then...
...Let the group soothe you.
one heart. Oh, yeah.
Oh, one heart. You like that.
here we go.
Roxie, Tony, It's time to meld.
bring it in here, big guy. - I DONT...I don't think so.
a great couple of melders you are.
there we are. Oh, you, hey!
one heart.
one heart.
we're actually talking eight hearts here.
most damage was confined to his pelvis and upper femurs, anterior and posterior.
the front of his pants contained tree bark and pine needles.
but there was also a bunch of refuse from the gardeners in the Dumpster, so I'm sorting through it now for genus and species.
as soon as you can. I'd like to give Cam some good news.
is it true that the prosecutor is going ahead with the case against her?
to the banks and the credit card companies, she's just an account number.
they're not gonna drop the charges until they get proof it wasn't her.
what did the lawyer say? You know Cam.
she wanted to take care of it herself.
I like the idea of separating the boys and girls. It would be fun to have a little girl talk.
Oh, I don't know. We've been to a lot of these.
I don't like being away from Bill. After 38 years, that's pretty good.
we have our fights, but I can't imagine life without this old bat.
you wrinkled old fart. So why do you keep coming to these things?
well, we get to travel, we're together and we get to watch all these crazy bastards.
so, Kelly Pak is probably very entertaining, huh?
Oh, you don't know the half of it.
wait till we all sweat together.
sweat? All sweat?
Yeah, we, uh, sweat over here. Sweat over here?
sweat over there.
shaman Little River says we come in here to sweat out the toxins that can cause emotional pain.
well, he's wrong. You can't sweat out toxins.
a sweat lodge can actually cause your kidneys to retain water, preventing your body from eliminating toxins.
how on earth do you know all that?
um, reading... you know, the magazines you find at the checkout counter at the grocery store?
that's how I know that whole sweat-toxin thing is whole lot of New Age crapola.
I mean, if that's true, what are we doing in here? I mean, I'm roasting.
well, traditionally, it's used to call on our ancestors to help and guide us through difficulty.
peyote is sometimes used to facilitate this.
Oh, I would never take drugs.
you sure could use something to chill out that temper of yours, sweetie, if you want to keep a man.
Adam will be back. Are those tears or sweat, doll?
I don't want to talk about it.
you having a seizure, love?
I'm calling on Kelly's ancestors to help her talk.
Oh, not... not my mother.
Oh, please, not my mother.
ali-frazier was the best fight of all time Oh, you're on crack.
excuse me. We're in here for a reason.
I agree with Tony. Yeah.
two undefeated champs slugging it out for the belt-- oh!
winner take all. Best fight ever!
you're comparing this to Rumble in the Jungle?
ali hired Larry Holmes to pound on him so he could take punches from Foreman.
it was a slugfest. you know? There was no artistry.
we're supposed to be talking about our relationships.
Yeah, we are, son. Talking about our relationship with boxing.
fine. You're all wrong!
Hagler-Hearns, 1985, is the greatest fight ever.
Hagler throws 42 punches to Hearns's 56 in the first round alone!
only three rounds total, and in the end, Hagler, bleeding, knocks out Hearns to secure his legacy as the greatest middleweight ever.
eight minutes of toe-to-toe bloody magic-- no contest!
now...
if we could apply to our relationships a fraction of the focus that we do to boxing, we wouldn't need to be sweating in here, now, would we?
fair enough. Yeah, all right.
you know what relationship I'm really interested in? Is that, uh, who is that, Kelly and, uh...
Oh, bad. Bad, huh? How bad?
Yeah, they had secrets. - Secrets?
you don't know that. I know.
they said they'd just gotten married, right?
but there was no newlywed vibe. Even we had a newlywed vibe.
well, you still do. But we're talking about Kelly now, so...
I agree, we still do. Well, you're just saying that because we're sweating.
uh, no, I'm not. I love you.
Oh, guys... oh... I think Adam was having an affair.
Kelly was crazy jealous. Real Housewives jealous.
Adam kept telling me how much he loved me.
all the time.
your ancestors want me to ask you if Adam ever showed you how much he loved you?
Seriously? Yeah.
Yeah, they-they want you to talk...
Yeah, especially your mother. I thought he loved me.
but he wouldn't leave his damn wife.
the things I said to him. And did.
I hurt him so bad.
I-I didn't mean to.
I swear, I love Adam.
you look nowhere near ready to leave. Oh, what time is it?
I got lost researching Kelly Pak, who, of course, is not Kelly Pak, but in actuality is really Kelly Goodman.
wow, that takes commitment-- bringing your mistress to a couples retreat?
Yeah, Booth said they were working out their anger issues. What are these?
Oh. Shh. Quiet. Wha...?
I saw Cam's name. And bank statements.
Yeah. Well, I'm looking for the fake Cam.
well, great. Why the secrecy? Seriously?
you know how Cam is. Do you know how fabulous you are?
well, I had to do something.
unfortunately, it's easier to find the Higgs boson than it is to recover a stolen identity.
Mmm, nice Higgs reference.
Hey, you noticed.
I'm gonna keep trying.
so, what's all this money? Is that fake, too? No.
this is real and it has nothing to do with Cam.
these are Kelly Goodman's bank statements over the last year.
and that is a wire transfer for over 900 grand she received five months ago from the estate of her last boyfriend.
estate? Yeah, he died.
but not before he changed his will. Two dead boyfriends back to back.
looks like Kelly Goodman never worked on those anger issues.
I found fracturing around the bony wall socket of the victim's two upper front teeth.
well, I'm not an expert on everything, but doesn't that happen when your teeth knocked out?
they weren't knocked out, they were yanked out.
no roots.
maybe his mistress tortured him for his financial passwords before killing him.
no, you don't need to torture to get passwords. Ask Cam.
thanks for the lawyer. Cam's all cheered up.
it's still gonna take months. You know? Maybe even years.
What?! She doesn't even have money for dinner.
trust me, man, okay?
thanks to Pelant, I know what it's like to lose everything.
I asked you here because, uh, I found this lodged in the teeth.
well, I'll check it out. She's gonna be okay, Arastoo, okay?
just maybe not in the next few days.
or... weeks.
or... I get it.
leave? You can't leave.
you think about leaving every day. No, I don't.
I'm not at the top of my game right now, so please don't lie to me.
all right, fine. I think about leaving. There you go.
but I'm a wild, free spirit artist-type with wanderlust, and you're a tight-assed geek boy who doesn't really fit in anywhere but here.
no offense. I got into psychology to help people.
and you are. No, I'm...
I mean individuals. Not just law enforcement.
I'm supposed to be a healer.
you remember last year, that young girl who was raped?
she came to me for help. What did I do?
I referred her to someone else.
that's helping. No!
it's delegating.
sweets. - Sweets, please tell me that Kelly killed her last boyfriend.
actually, he died in a car accident. She was nowhere near the scene.
Hey, look, what about Shaman Touchy Feely? Uh, oh, get this.
shaman Little River is actually named Jeremy Brewster.
he changed his name ten years ago. Good work, Sweets.
don't patronize me. I'm relaying a message.
there's no psychological insight involved here.
sweets, relax. I'm just record-keeping.
okay, why'd he change his name? Maybe he was unhappy with the non-integration of his childhood personae.
Sweets! Just check his file.
there's got to be a reason. Okay, well...
he had priors. DUIs, assault, money fraud.
thank you. Assault.
all right? He has a temper.
listen, you're just freaking out because Pelant hacked into all your research on all of us and then used it against us.
you feel guilty. Thank you, Dr. Montenegro.
Where'd you get your degree in psychology again? The same place you got that degree in sarcasm.
listen, we all feel responsible. But we're not running away.
I'm not running away, okay? I'm trying to get back to the real world.
start helping people. Be a psychologist again.
get my hands dirty.
this is an exercise of trust and communication.
one of each couple will don this protective suit, which includes the blindfold.
the other will talk his or her spouse through the course.
but first, choose who's gonna do what.
suit 'em.
right... over here. One suit over here for him.
no, I'll-I'll wear that one. Right here.
ease up. Step over that log. That's it, honey.
right over there... oh!
Oh, sweetheart. Come on. Are you okay, honey?
you okay?
you can do it. We can do it.
go! A different way to go, I found...
get up!
stop, Mark! Come back!
keep walking, doll, okay?
Yeah. And go!
great, great!
Yeah, yeah, Tony!
Oh, perfect, yay!
jump and jump!
go, Tony! Good!
come ON
yay, Tony!
they're swinging poles.
okay? On my count.
one, two, three!
Tony! Tony! Are you okay?
Oh, my God! Tony, are you okay?
I said, you know, with a slight hesitation, not the full body blow.
booth, the victim was hit from both directions at the same time.
I think this could be the murder scene.
great. A little help here, Roxie, huh?
get me up! Come on, this is... I got it.
geez, just roll it over. I'm trying, Tony.
just roll it over like a manicotti.
feel the stuffed shell, baby. That's it.
FBI? That's right.
Mm-hmm, FBI.
and I am also a very well-respected forensic anthropologist who convinced you I was Roxie because of my superb acting skills.
that's enough, Bones. You have no jurisdiction here.
okay, was that your big plan, huh, pal?
huh? Kill anyone you want because we have no jurisdiction?
kill? What are you talking about? Adam Pak was killed here.
I didn't do it. I'm a healer, not a killer.
a healer? You're Jeremy Brewster.
and you have a record.
okay, I'm sort of a fraud.
but I've read all the self-help books. I give them what they need.
my clients, they get their money's worth. Well, maybe Adam found out who you really were.
that gives you great motive to keep him quiet.
the evidence suggests he was killed on your obstacle course.
you know, I don't have to talk to you. No, you don't have to say a word.
as long as you don't leave this land.
but the second you step off, you're all ours.
okay, okay.
Adam and Kelly, they were both insane.
he confessed to me that he was married.
made me promise not to tell anyone.
then Kelly started coming on to me to make Adam jealous.
they need real help.
I could only imagine what would happen if his wife found out.
we're gonna keep an eye on you, Jeremy.
please don't tell them about me.
I've got a good business going here-- honest.
it's stuck, Booth. All right, you got to get me out of this.
I'm a ball of sweat in here.
Oh, you didn't have to do this, Arastoo. It's nothing-- I stole it.
that way if you go to prison, we can share a cell.
Hodgins' lawyer said I have to hire a forensic accountant to dig through all the fraudulent records.
this could take months.
my salary's gonna have to go into an escrow account.
what happened to "innocent until proven guilty"?
I feel like I'm back in Iran.
so, based on the data and the photos from Brennan and Booth, there is no way that the gauntlet is the murder weapon.
there isn't enough speed behind the pendulum swing and the fracture patterns don't match.
of course, why did I expect good news? Good news!
okay, don't play with me, Dr. Hodgins.
the results on the wood splinter from the victim's teeth are in.
it's oak. Same splinters they found on his clothes.
Yes, but there are traces of sap still present in these. Is that important?
well, it means that the sliver's from a living tree. Now, check this out.
these are oak trees in the southeast corner of the reservation.
right at the edge of the New Dawn Retreat property.
Yeah, now that whitish gray substance on the overgrown grass, that is agricultural lime.
Adam Pak died in this part of the reservation.
this is the murder scene.
this tree has sustained significant damage to its bark.
look, Booth, these are teeth.
this is the murder weapon. Oh, ho, ho, ho, wait a second here.
look at this, huh?
keys, yeah, these could be the victim's or the killer's.
even with skeletal fluorosis, Adam's injuries are not consistent with just running into a tree.
something propelled him into the tree with great force.
Yeah, like a car? I mean, come on, look at these.
huh? Is it a coincidence that these tire tracks go right up to the murder tree?
Oh, look at this, huh? Driveway gravel.
you seem awfully sure. Yeah, and it's red, too, okay?
it's the same red driveway gravel that I saw at Emma Pak's house.
I'm bringing her in.
the tree is a match and so are the teeth.
Yeah, I heard. Are you okay?
I just got another letter from a collection agency.
this one says I owe $36, 000.
whoever's using my name has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.
you knew there'd be more.
cam... She's ruined my good name.
no, not... not here. Let's make an exception.
I grew up in the South Bronx.
I've been working since I was 11 years old.
I know.
valedictorian in my high school, full academic scholarship through med school,
I interned at two of the best hospitals in the country. I know your story.
I was the youngest coroner in New York City.
and now... You're here.
running the most respected lab in the country. And somebody has stolen that from me.
no. Yes!
stolen everything I have worked my whole life for.
not even close. I am this far away from debtor's prison.
they don't have that anymore. I might lose my house.
all of that is true...
but none of it is really you.
you're just saying that because you love me.
I do.
I don't know what else you want me to say.
look, I-I didn't know he was cheating on me, I swear.
we got a dead body, okay?
and your driveway gravel puts you at the scene of the crime.
that's impossible. I never left my house.
look, ask the security company. My guess is you called security to give yourself an alibi that night.
who thinks like that? - Murderers.
that's who thinks like that. Murderers.
you didn't learn anything about your relationship with Booth?
I wasn't there with Booth.
Roxie was there with Tony. Okay.
did Roxie learn anything about her relationship with Tony?
shaman Little River is a fraud, Angela. He has no wisdom to impart.
you, a trained anthropologist, immersed yourself in a specific culture and you learned nothing?
I did realize that, compared to others,
booth and I have a very good relationship.
so you learned nothing. There's something embedded...
what is that? Inorganic.
given the location, it could be from the car that hit Adam Pak from behind and propelled him into the tree.
you manipulated me into answering that question by exploiting my professional ego.
God, the old Brennan never would've seen that.
Oh, gotta run.
okay, here you go.
uh, digital and hard copies.
what's this? Well, I figure why pay a forensic accountant when you've got me?
I don't believe it.
and I don't bill by the hour, so I won't waste your time.
Wh... Angela, you're too busy. I didn't want you to do this.
Yeah, I know. Because you're insane.
you've got friends here, Cam. People who love you.
Arastoo... It's not a burden for any of us to help you.
it's time you start accepting that. I just didn't want people to...
Yeah, we don't need to hear the reasons.
okay, so... these are all the fraudulent accounts that have been opened or used in your name within the last 90 days.
I mean, it's just a start, but it's something.
how did you...? Well...
I looked in a few places I wasn't supposed to be looking.
I won't get into the details.
I just thought, since you were the good guy...
Oh, don't cry. No, I won't.
thank you.
the particulate you found was a chrome alloy.
from a car? I can be even more specific.
you see, over the last 50 years, right, the auto industry has changed the chrome alloy composition it uses on cars.
the composition of the particulate from the victim proves that the car that hit Adam Pak was manufactured prior to the 1970s.
so, a vintage car. Give me some time, I can track down the make.
you can have all the time you want, but I think I might know.
the Schumachers drive a 1965 van. The Schumachers?
yeah - I did not see that coming.
should've known. - Why?
Why? Because they're like the world's greatest couple.
I mean, what were they doing at that couples' retreat?
I'm the shrink! I should have thought of that. Okay, what did you find out?
well, the Schumachers went to four different couples' retreats where one of the other guests said that their place was broken into.
see? That's good information. Come on, it's not psychological insight.
it's just... checking records.
it's not my job. Look, the Schumachers...
you know what? They know their victims, okay?
they steal their keys and they break into their houses.
so it was the Schumachers that Emma Pak heard at the house that night.
they got the key, they showed up at the house to rob it 'cause they thought Kelly was the wife, right?
boom! Booth.
I left a letter on your desk. No, no.
I have some leave I haven't taken. What do you mean, leave?
it'll be like a vacation.
I... I NEED some time.
just to clear my head. No, I don't like this.
I need time.
okay. Time.
thank you. Yeah.
we found blood in the back of your van.
well, yeah, that's from his head, where Evelyn smacked him.
Yeah, after he attacked Bill.
Yeah, after he had slapped Evelyn when he caught her returning his house key to the tent.
and Bill karate-chopped him in the throat. Yeah.
right... What... what did you smack him with?
okay, you carry this around with you? An old lady alone in the world?
I call that my equalizer.
you know, we thought Pak was dead.
bundled him into the van and looked to dump him somewhere.
Yeah, but he woke up and tried to make a run for it.
so you ran him over. God, this...
this guy knows everything, doesn't he? Your mother must be so proud.
okay, a little word of advice:
when you go to the courts, you know, try to look... sorry, you know?
it helps. Well, that's gonna be hard.
I mean, the man brought his mistress to a married couples' retreat.
no one's gonna cry for him. Marriage means something.
now...
are you really married to that sweetheart you brought to the retreat, huh?
okay, what if I say "no"? You gonna hit me over the head and run me over?
no. It's obvious you love her.
Yeah, the way she looked at you... you can't fake that. No, no.
marry her, big boy. - Oh, come on, look...
I am not gonna take some advice from a couple of house-robbing murderers.
then take advice from a couple who've loved each other for 38 years.
Oh, hey...
we're gonna be able to bunk together in prison, right?
Oh, of course, pet. They can't break us up.
you know that.
you didn't tell the Schumachers that they'd be separated in prison?
well, you know, I didn't have the heart to do that, I just...
all right, Bones, why are we doing this? The guy was a fraud.
although I don't believe in the shaman's "fluctuating fields of force" exercise,
I do believe in biological electrical impulses. Okay, come on, let's hurry up, let's get this done, I got a game to watch.
booth... What?
come on. All right.
only our palms touch, nothing else.
just let your mind drift.
sweets is, um, taking a leave of absence.
to do what? Well, he said that he, uh, lost touch with his original motivation for being a psychologist.
well, I thought he was a psychologist because he had substandard math skills.
okay, are we done here or...?
No! No. Booth, come on.
all right. I'm right here. I'm right here.
did Bill and Evelyn remind you of us?
um... well, if somebody was choking me, would you hit them over the head with a billiard ball?
Yes. If someone slapped me, would you karate chop them in the throat?
Yeah, I would.
booth! Mm-hmm?
booth, we are only supposed to touch the palms of our hands... Oh...
I can't help it. I... ...nothing else.
I'm just drifting.
I'm drifting with the whole... electronical device thing.
electrical impulses.
there's a hacker named Christopher Pelant.
where are you? Anywhere I want to be.
this guy's killed how many people? Eight.
this guy is worse than anyone you and I have ever come across.
Hello, Temperance▪ Pelant.
what do you think happened to poor Chloe Campbell? I think you killed her.
wasn't me. You know who did it.
uh, same person who did 187-05-7932, and 9224-- they were all killed by one person, and I think she's still out there.
you okay, Bones? The next explosion will level the entire building.
shoot him, Booth！What?
shoot him!
and if anything happens to me, she'll keep doing what she's doing, and you'll never find out who she is.
who's taken these remains?
who has these remains?!
who's been in here?!
you shouldn't have shot me, Temperance. You'll never find the killer alone.
you'll never find... You'll never find the killer alone.
you'll never find the killer alone.
you hate me. You hate me... hate me.
no, I don't! No, I don't! Give me those remains!
without me... without me... you'll never find what connects the victims, Temperance.
where are you?! Where are you?!
No! What? What is it?! What?
what? I dreamt of Pelant▪Booth.
Oh. Again?
he had the evidence, all the bones, and then I was buried.
it was a dream, right? He was laughing at me, Booth.
what? He said that I would never find the Ghost Killer.
Pelant is dead, right? I will find the killer, Booth. I will.
okay, all right, I know you will. It's just, it was a dream, okay?
you need to get some rest, all right?
rest. Come on.
come here. Okay. Hold me.
okay... All right... I got you.
tighter. O.K.
I'm right here. It's okay. Shh.
I'm right here.
I don't understand why Cam won't believe the serial killer is real.
well, it's 'cause there's no evidence that they're linked. I mean, there's nothing conclusive.
which is why she should keep the case open. I need the resources.
you know, you have to admit,
I mean, from the outside, it does look like Pelant was just playing you.
is that what you believe? Look, I mean, O.K.
you've been poring over this case for months, and you haven't come up with anything.
we can't just, you know, launch an investigation on a ghost.
so you don't believe me? No, it's not that. I just...
you know what?
I don't want to argue. It's a beautiful day, huh?
I'm gonna go get the paper.
bones, you expecting a package? No. Why?
well... one here.
no. Wow.
what kind of sick joke is this?
someone took great care in packaging these remains.
there's a note.
please find out what really happened to me.
based on the shape of the frontal bone, the narrow nasal aperture and the size of the mandible, the victim was a Caucasian female.
aren't you even the least bit freaked out that these remains were sent to your house?
I'm the best forensic anthropologist in the country. Wouldn't you want me examining your remains?
I think Angela was referring more to the mysterious nature of the delivery.
and the fact that it was to your home, not the lab. No.
there's too much red tape here. They may not have even bring it to me.
desiccated skin, soil... this victim was interred at least a decade.
I'll see what particulates I can get off this.
whoa, did you sleep in those clothes?
what? No.
uh, apologies, uh, for being late. Why are you even here?
I called him when I thought we might be dealing with archaeological remains.
ten years does not classify these as archaeological. Well, I'm already here, so I might as well help out.
I don't need another forensic anthropologist. What I need is an intern.
none of whom are available, and you need help, Dr. Brennan.
so, boss me around.
I'm ready. Clean these.
no postmark? No fingerprints?
it's no surprise.Anyone who digs someone up and delivers them like takeout
of course they're going to be careful, Sweets. You okay?
no, I'm not okay, okay, Sweets? I'm not.
someone delivered a dead body to my house. How can I be okay?
right. Sorry. It's just, it seems...
and Bones is having nightmares again.
Oh？ Yeah.
she thinks there's another serial killer out there. Because that's what Pelant told her before he died?
Yes. He just wanted her to think that he was necessary.
right? And she feels the need to prove that he's not.
okay, Pelant is dead. The guy is dead.
why can't anyone just accept that?
I understand. Okay, then, help me with the case.
all right, look at the case. Maybe it'll take Bones's mind off this craziness.
okay. Well, the remains are painstakingly wrapped in cloth.
and the note implies that the truth of her death was never known, so, whoever did this took a big risk because they care about the victim.
but how do you know that this is not some psycho playing some sick games with her?
unfortunately, we don't.
the victim is Lana Brewster.
died at 18 in 1995. Wasn't she a sailing champion?
Yeah. The Coast Guard found.
Lana Brewster's partially sunken boat.
well, it's hard to miss a boat that big.
well, she wasn't on her racing boat that day.
she had taken out her regular, everyday boat.
multiple boats. Must be nice.
her body was found washed up on the rocks a couple days later.
so, lots of postmortem damage from wave action, fish, rocks.
this solo round-the-world race she took, It began in Newport, Rhode Island, and made stops in Cape Town, Sydney, and Rio.
it's an amazing achievement until you consider that it doesn't actually achieve anything.
it was inspirational. She was a hero for millions of teenage girls.
I'm seeing a remodeled fracture to the victim's right tibia.
the break didn't properly heal. Oh, yes, that happened during the race.
she set it herself and then continued racing. How do you know that?
it was kind of a big deal at the time, sweetie.
Lana Brewster accomplished this crazy, inspirational, round-the-world race, and then dies a few months later during an afternoon sail in calm weather?
it doesn't really make sense.
Hey, I found these lodged in the skin around the victim's wrist.
some kind of fiber. Well, she was buried in silk, and the lining of the coffin was satin. This is neither.
and I saw pores and follicle spaces.
leather? Yeah.
and judging by the film filling the pores, this is treated leather.
leather on the wrist...
Hey, were leather string bracelets a thing in 1995?
I don't know but it's not on the list of materials interred with her. And it wasn't an open casket funeral, so it couldn't have been tossed in at the last minute. All right.
well, there's something else, too.
traces of trillium pusillum pollen on both the box and the victim's bones.
it still contains live cytoplasm. So it was deposited after the body was removed from the grave.
Yeah. And since there's no trillium in the cemetery, then the remains must have been brought somewhere else before dropped off at Booth and Brennan's.
okay, well, do that thing where you figure out where it comes from.
you're so lucky ，I know what you mean.
somebody dug up my sister?
Yeah, and delivered her remains to a forensic anthropologist who works for the FBI.
well, who would do that? We were hoping you could help us with that.
well, I haven't got a clue.
we think that whoever did this loved your sister ，and wanted the authorities to reopen her murder investigation.
listen, I know where you're going with this, but I'm just not that guy.
you're her brother. You're her only living relative.
I barely knew Lana, and what I did know ,I didn't really like.
Why? Looking back, maybe I was petty, but Lana was famous
magazine covers, TV appearances,and my parents loved that.
but I was just a regular kid, so I was nobody to them.
can you think of anybody who does have strong feelings for your sister?
according to my parents, everybody.
everybody in the whole world.
she sailed around the world alone. What's not to love?
okay, well, whoever exhumed your sister's remains left a note.
please find out what really happened to me.
now, obviously, this person doesn't think that your sister just drowned.
I think there was a boy. A boyfriend?
I heard my parents talking about it.
they didn't like him.
do you know this boy's name? No.
when they saw I was there, they stopped talking...
like always.
I have got Lana Brewster's original autopsy report.
any surprises? Yes.
it was utterly incompetent.
very little detail. She died of drowning.
there's practically no mention of broken bones, no cataloguing of tissue damage from fish.
or the traces of leather found on both her wrists. She was bound?
there's nothing in here about that either. Lana Brewster was a public figure.
how could the medical examiner escape scrutiny?
the little bone damage she did catalogue was listed as postmortem, when it's obviously perimortem.
whoever sent you these remains was right to do so.
Lana Brewster was murdered.
cam says the medical examiner working on Lana's case wasn't just negligent, but that she lied about Lana's cause of death.
why did she cover up the murder? Money, it seems.
before the Brewster case, Leslie Dollinger was just a temp medical examiner, brought in when the backlog got to be too much. And Lana Brewster was the last case she worked on?
Yeah, before she started that case, she had $2, 000 to her name.
after she released the report ruling the death accidental, she received a $1. 9 million transfer into a brokerage account in her name.
Yeah. After that, she never worked again.
she took off to Costa Rica. Well, we have an extradition treaty with them.
if we can show collusion...
the only way you're gonna talk to Leslie Dollinger is through a psychic.
she died of an aneurysm eight years ago.
well, do we know who paid her off? I'm working on it.
bones? I have been waiting outside in the car for a half an hour.
you said you'd be right out. Oh, sorry.
I... I lost track of time.
this isn't the Lana Brewster case, is it? No.
it's a serial killer. The markings on this sternum are very similar to the markings on this one.
that's never been good enough for you before to explain the problem.
I don't want to argue, Booth. I don't want to,either.
but, you know, I'm... I'm concerned about you.
I mean, you're having more nightmares. No, I'm used to them.
neuropsychologists now think that it's the mind excreting feelings and information that it can't process awake. And I think you're obsessed.
you're so obsessed you don't even know how to shut it down, even when you're asleep.
so you don't believe me? Listen, I want to.
but where's the evidence that links them?
real and hard evidence.
I learned that from you.
do you think I'm crazy? Yeah, a little.
I do. This is not you.
no, there's a link. I will find it.
that's fine. Tickle the bones, and do whatever it is that you do.
but do it how you do it.
all right! Don't let Pelant call the shots.
all right! Don't keep him alive.
otherwise you're never gonna find the truths.
let's go home now, okay?
the Ghost Killer's gonna be here in the morning.
okay, I'll put these away.
Dr. Edison?
Oh, Dear! Dr. Saroyan.
the security guard just told me that you slept here last night.
can I get a towel?
uh, it's...it's chilly.
employees are not allowed to use the facilities as a second home, Dr. Edison.
I wasn't. I wasn't.
um, I just worked late. That's all.
assuming I believe you, you should manage your time better. Y...You're right.
I mean, sometimes I just get lost... That doesn't explain sleeping here.
well, I had a lot of work, so I might have dozed a bit.
you've been wrinkled and disheveled for two days. You're never wrinkled and disheveled.
would you like an explanation? No.
Really? Whatever it is, will be complicated and none of my business.
all I want is for you to follow the rules handed down by the Jeffersonian board, so I don't have to fire you. Yes, sure, yes.
now put on that wrinkled shirt and get to work.
jealousy is always a good motive for murder.
there was another sailor that competed against Lana for the Paxton Cup.
they were contemporaries. I remember this.
it was, um, Erika something.
Yeah, Erika Stamp. Erika Stamp.
how did you know that? I used to sail.
Erika Stamp, she actually won, didn't she?
Yeah.,I never knew you sailed.
Yeah, I was a rich kid, you know.We had to sail and have at least one girlfriend named Muffy.
it's in the charter. Erika did win, but then the cup was taken away from her and given to Lana Brewster, who came in second.
I remember this. Erika cheated.
Muffy? Yeah.
I dumped her for Binky.
now, Binky, Binky was hot. Oh, my God.
I am so disoriented right now. I got to admit, I am, too.
it says here that Lana was actually the one that reported Erika for cheating.
Erika never recovered. She wasn't allowed to compete again, right?
Uh...huh. Yeah.
she also served some jail time.
for what? Insurance fraud.
she intentionally sunk her boat for the insurance money. She pulled out her transducer.
well, that'll do it. Yeah.
and when Lana's boat went down in the exact same way.
the transducer.
Lana Brewster's the reason for my life went to hell.
I can't believe I have to talk about the little bitch again.
18 years, the anger's still very fresh, huh?
I borrowed one small roll of tape from a passing boat to fix my sail.
Lana could've let that go. But, no, she had me disqualified for it.
you'd be pretty pissed, too.
so in your points of view, Lana cost you everything.
she did cost me everything. I lost my endorsements.
I wasn't allowed to compete. My family disowned me.
now, you sunk your boat in the exact same way that Lana's killer sunk hers.
look, anyone familiar with sailboats knows the easiest way to sink one is by pulling the transducer. Okay.
well, where were you the day that Lana was murdered?
I've served time... so I know you're fishing, and I don't have to stay here.
if you have any other questions, find someone who cares.
there is no way I would ever go out in a boat like this.
I'm gonna start calling you Popeye. Hey, I won a few races before.
Oh, yacht club? It was mandatory.
Hey, the boat's outboard motor is missing.
maybe she didn't it. Can you enlarge the image?
all right, see these marks?
this is where the motor would normally be clamped on.
maybe she left it at home that day or something. No, it's unlikely.
Why? What are you thinking?
was her dinghy found with the boat?
according to the Coast Guard files, no dinghy or outboard motor were ever recovered.
Yeah, of course not. What?
whoever killed Lana probably put the motor on the dinghy to get back to shore after sinking the boat.
that's why neither was ever found.
I'd like to help, Seeley.
but Dr. Brennan has no evidence to link these cases to a serial killer.
has she ever asked for something like this before? That's not the point.
that's exactly the point, okay? She's having nightmares, okay?
she can't stop thinking about those cold cases.
I'm gonna get in trouble for spending funds to allow her to pursue a dead end.
and if I don't report what she's doing, I'm hiding expenses and I could get fired.
so let her find out the dead end. You know she's gonna admit it if she's wrong.
I do? Just let this play out.
I'm sure you can get creative with the paperwork.
do you believe her, Seeley? I really want to.
don't you?
I'll try my best.
Aw, man.
yacht clubs, sailing, prep schools.
you're dealing very well with the loss of your fortune.
truthfully, I thought it would be harder.
but I don't know, when I'm at work, I'm not thinking about money.
when I'm with Angela and Michael Vincent, it never crosses my mind.
I mean, even with you. The coffee's good,with the company.
I'm impressed. As long as a person has enough, they don't need more.
and I've got more than enough. 'Cause I saw pictures of that, uh, estate you had in Wales. Whoof!
Oh, yeah. Okay, now that place was sweet.
Oh, man, I do miss that. Thank you very much.
I found out who paid off the medical examiner.
the $1. 9 million that Leslie Dollinger received was from the Kestech Transpo Corporation.
who owns Kestech? Well, I had to dig deep because Kestech is owned by a holding company which is owned by a bunch of other holding companies, but I tracked it down.
Kestech is part of the McNamara Corporation.
Oh, my God, the McNamaras.
Yeah, McNam... They're as rich as you were.
Nah, they were richer. I mean that's railroad and oil money.
my dad used to play golf with the patriarch, Giles.
I mean, our families, we hung out together.
but the financial trail leads right to your old friends.
the McNamaras paid off Leslie Dollinger to cover up Lana's murder.
okay, so how is Lana Brewster then connected to the McNamaras?
excuse me? Trent McNamara.
Hey, didn't Lana's brother say she had a boyfriend?
and you think it was him? His father was always bailing him out of one mess or another.
he also went through girls like they were toys.
Trent McNamara was a nasty piece of work.
Trent McNamara was a pretty troubled kid.
he got kicked out of four prep schools for cheating, drugs and assault.
wait a second. What kind of assault?
fighting mostly. The last school tried to channel that aggression into fencing.
and he was good, but he got kicked out of that, too, when he took the tip of his foil.
what are you saying? He actually stabbed someone?
in psychological terms, the kid was a mess.
and get this, two days after Lana's body was found, his father shipped him off to some private school in Switzerland.
okay. Fleeing the country and falsified coroner's report.
it doesn't look good for Trent. Maybe that's what the note with Lana's remains meant.
please find out what really happened to me.
you think Trent is what happened to her? You can ask him.
what? Is he here?
his father died three days ago. Trent's in town for the funeral.
but can I make a suggestion, Booth? Send Hodgins instead of me.
Hodgins? Why?
Hodgins is a blue blood, like Trent. They even knew each other.
whoa, wait a second， Hodgins speaks rich people language?
exactly. Okay, I got a even better idea.
why don't you and Hodgins go talk to him?
but... Booth?
Dr. Edison... What?
I was just getting something to eat. Good.
I could have eaten at home, and I just wanted to get a jump on the day.
what do you think of Dr. Brennan's serial killer?
I'm sorry. Excuse me?
do you think those cases are linked? Is there a serial killer?
I'm asking for your opinion.
I'm skeptical. Excellent.
these are the files on all six Ghost Killer victims.
I want you to oversee this case.
does Dr. Brennan know you're making me responsible for these? She doesn't need to know.
but I'd like to keep this between us for as long as possible. Oh, yeah.
this is nice.
no, I didn't. This is why you brought me, Sweets?
I heard the envy in your voice.
there he is.
Yeah, and that's his sister Stephanie.
wow, time has been a bit tough on Trent.
I remember him as an athletic golden boy. Now he looks like hell.
okay, I heard a definite tinge of satisfaction in your voice.
Yeah, you did. Trent was a dick.
it's good to see you, Jack. I'm sorry to hear about you losing your family's money.
must be difficult. Jack never really seemed to care much for money.
as long as he had his bugs. I'm doing fine, Steph.
I married an amazing woman, I have a beautiful boy, so...
no complaints, actually. We want to talk to you about Lana Brewster.
the sailor girl?
Yeah, her brother told us that she had a boyfriend around the time that she died.
didn't say who it was, though. We thought it might be you, Trent.
boy, you really must be a part of the FBI. Should we call our lawyer?
it was me. And?
you liked a lot of girls, Trent. Why'd you keep this one a secret?
because I was in court-ordered Alcoholics Anonymous.
you're not supposed to start a romantic relationship when you start AA.
so why did you skip town right after Lana's death? He didn't skip town.
it was a coincidence. We ran out of American private schools.
dad was hoping the Swiss could handle me.
we have evidence your father paid off the medical examiner to cover up the fact that Lana was murdered.
you think I killed Lana? Looks like that's what your father thought.
Jack! We all know how these things work, okay?
he was trying to protect Trent.
it's been really lovely seeing you again, Jack, but this is definitely the part where we call our lawyer.
do you concur this is probably cause of death?
Yes. Why didn't we see this earlier?
it was obfuscated by the blunt force trauma that fractured the sternum.
do you think this could have been cause by a foil?
Oh! From fencing.
Yes. Yes, that is possible.
Dr. Brennan? I've seen this wound before.
on one of the Ghost Killer victims. That seems unlikely.
everyone keeps telling me that I'm making connections that aren't there.
but I don't do that kind of thing. I'm not that kind of a person.
Dr. Brennan, we're supposed to be working on the Lana Brewster case.
these remains are the ones that Pelant led me check two months ago.
the ones where he said all of them were murdered by the same serial killer?
a woman, yes. So this has nothing to do with Lana Brewster's case.
I believe Lana Brewster was the first victim.
Chloe Campbell and Lana Brewster were both killed as a result of a nail-like stake being punched through their sternum.
it's a very unique injury. The indentations are different.
I can't corroborate your supposition. I don't need your approval, Dr. Edison.
Yeah, but you do need someone to back you up, especially if you're accusing Trent McNamara of being a serial killer.
I already said the serial killer is a woman. Dr. Brennan.
do you recall Trent was a fencer ，and this wound is congruent with a sharpened foil?
Trent McNamara didn't murder Lana Brewster.
because Trent McNamara is not a woman? Exactly.
Dr. Saroyan wanted me to ask you to return to the lab.
our first priority is solving Lana Brewster's murder.
so you don't believe me, either.
it's not about belief. It's about the evidence.
you taught me that.
if Dr. Saroyan wants us to get back to the lab, we should...
I know who you are. You're not supposed to be here.
Yeah, I'm not here in an official capacity...
I don't care why you're here. This family's been harassed enough.
now if you don't leave here...
it's okay. It's okay, Donna.
Jack, why are you here? I told him to leave, Mr. McNamara.
I can call the guys... It's okay.
I got this. You can work around back right now.
you know I'm not supposed to talk to you, Jack.
yeah? Then you let me talk.
I never liked you, Trent.
you were that guy, the one who took pleasure in tormenting the weaker kids.
is this going someplace?
you know, I remember the night that you slept over at my place.
and my mom and dad, they came in to say good night, and they gave me a hug and a kiss.
you know, I didn't think anything of it.
but you asked if something special was happening.
you said you couldn't remember if your parents ever did that.
and of course, you made fun of me, because you were supposed to be strong.
but I saw how much you wished it was you to be hugged and kissed.
and that's probably why we never hung out after that, 'cause you were embarrassed that I saw that.
and you think I'm the same. You think that I killed Lana.
I get it. You didn't have to drive all the way out here to tell me that.
but I don't, Trent. I think you did love Lana.
and...
I don't think you would kill someone who gave you what you wanted for so long.
you're the only one, Jack.
the remains from the six Ghost Killer murders are missing.
no, they aren't. I assigned them to Dr. Edison.
and there is no Ghost Killer. Not yet, at least.
I'll have them sent back to me. No, you won't.
I'm your boss, Dr. Brennan. Don't forget that.
everyone's colluding, working against me.
I don't understand. Why would you give those remains to Dr. Edison?
because Dr. Edison is an objective eye. Perhaps, but I'm better.
not when you don't see clearly. You want those six murders solved, don't you?
that means that I have to assign resources for it.
but to do that, I have to convince the board, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that there is, in fact, a serial killer.
and my word isn't enough? Would it be for you?
with no evidence? Look, I am trying to help you, Dr. Brennan.
and I think you know there is no one in the world that would work harder to impress you than Dr. Edison.
that is not true.
of all the people working at the Jeffersonian, he is the least awed by my abilities.
that is absolutely true, if you mean the complete opposite.
I've already done so much work .
I have binders filled with findings.
then I suggest you give those to Dr. Edison, because he is the one who will determine whether or not we're looking for a serial killer.
that is my decision.
you can't tell Cam. Tell Cam what?
well... these weapons are for the Lana Brewster murder.
but these are for the Ghost Killer.
the Ghost Killer? We owe it to Brennan, don't we?
even if it comes to nothing? You really are a wonderful guy.
even if you did sleep with a Binky. You don't make that sound as good as it was.
sorry, uh... what did you need, Angie?
Yeah, uh... It's Trent.
uh, Booth just called. Trent shot himself.
what?
I-I just saw him.
what did the note say? Um, I don't think there was a note.
after everything that happened, Trent would've left a note.
okay, Cam will check. She's going out there now.
I'm going, too. Honey, I think...
I have to, Angie, okay? I can help.
the window was closed, and I wasn't too sure...
thought Dr. Brennan would come. This is all flesh.
not her domain.
I don't believe this. Are you sure you're okay, Dr. Hodgins?
Yes. I have a job to do.
we can get somebody else to gather the particulates... They might miss something.
I can do this, Cam. Okay.
a single gunshot wound to the temple.
no other evidence of foul play on the remains.
this sure looks to me like an admission of guilt.
excuse me, Officer, uh... have you find a note yet?
Steph, you really shouldn't be here right now.
I don't know why I'm surprised.
you were expecting this? No. Not this.
it's just... something. It's always something in this family.
Trent killed a girl, probably just 'cause he was sick of her, and Daddy didn't care, he just sent him away.
Steph, I'm gonna take you into the other room, okay?
I'm gonna get you settled, all right?
Trent was the last male.
I think that's a good thing.
we'll release his body as soon as we can.
I suppose a funeral will be expected.
it'll be big... even though no one cares.
Hey, Steph, let me take you into the other room, okay? We'll get you settled.
Hey, Cam wants to know if you have the results from Trent's swabs.
she wants to finish the autopsy as soon as possible. I'm just waiting on the Mass Spec.
when I went to go see him this afternoon, he was wearing this shirt.
I'm so sorry, honey.
we could've turned out the same way. We had the same kind of life.
Yeah, but you turned out a lot different. Thank God.
he was such a dick and all, you know?
but he just didn't seem like the kind of guy who would kill someone.
that was more his dad's thing. That's why I went to go see him, you know?
just to tell him that. But I don't know, I don't know.
maybe that just made it worse. Maybe that's why he shot himself.
no, honey, you didn't have anything to do with this.
if he was the killer, he would've left a note, Angie. He would've told us why.
things don't always end as we'd like them to.
I just keep hoping that we missed something somewhere that, you know, he wasn't a murderer.
Yeah, but so far, the evidence says we haven't.
are those the results for Cam?
antimony, barium, and lead.What does that mean?
it means Trent's hands tested positive for gunshot residue.
cam will use this to confirm that he... he shot himself.
since you have been doubting my judgment as a forensic anthropologist,
I'll allow Dr. Edison to explain this to you. I absolutely trust you, Dr. Brennan.
by having Dr. Edison do my work? I don't think I should be here for this conversation.
I agree, but Dr. Saroyan wants you here, so proceed, Dr. Edison-- tell her what I found.
if you agree with my conclusions.
Dr. Edison?
the victim has a remodeled injury to the carpals on his right hand.
it's indicative of a deep laceration that cut all the way down to the bone.
I thought I was explaining. You are. Very slowly.
a cut this deep would have seperated the median and ulnar nerves at the wrist.
in which case, Trent would've been able to point, maybe even throw up a peace sign.
but he wouldn't have had any fine motor skills.
Trent McNamara was incapable of bending his trigger finger, which means he could not have shot himself.
with any other gun, I'd agree with you, Dr. Brennan, but the weapon he used was a stainless . 357
that only has a three-and-a-half-pound trigger pull. It's very light.
it would have been painful, but he still would have been capable of pulling the trigger.
then why didn't he simply use his left hand? He was trying to kill himself, Dr. Brennan.
suicides use their dominant hand 98. 8% of the time.
exactly. There's still a possibility that this is not a suicide and an even greater possibility that he did not murder Lana Brewster.
isn't that correct, Dr. Edison? Leaning hard on the word "possibility," but yes.
Hey. I just finished going over the visitor logs that the techs sent over from the McNamara estate. And?
Dan Brewster visited Trent less than an hour before he died.
Yeah, I went to see Trent McNamara. What's the big deal?
he's dead. What?
how? It was either a suicide or a death made to look like suicide.
why'd you go see him? He called me.
this explains a lot. Why?
he told me that Lana worried about me.
he said that she felt terrible about Erika Stamp, too.
they used to be close.
why did you say, "This explains a lot"?
it's obvious now, isn't it? He was making amends.
you're saying that Trent was tidying up loose ends before killing himself.
Yeah.
I know what you're thinking.
Wh... Why would I kill him? For revenge?
you were the last person to see Trent alive.
Yes, and that's exactly how I left him... alive.
Oh! Dr. Brennan...
good evening.
do you have the time to do this properly? Excuse me?
I'm concerned that if it comes to a choice between the Ghost Killer, your archaeological endeavors, and your personal life, the Ghost Killer will lose.
by which I mean win.
Nora and I are breaking up after eight years together.
there comes a time when, if a couple doesn't make that next step...
you see, Nora wanted to get married, and I ...
I think Nora has found someone else to move forward with.
I mean, I can't prove it, but as you know, you don't always need proof to know when something is true.
even if it isn't,
Nora and I are not together anymore, and I have to tell you I'm, uh...
I'm very... I'm very sad about that.
so, yes...
I promise that I have more than enough time.
I won't let you down.
thank you. That is a great relief to me.
I'm sorry for the emotional pain you're going through.
and I admire the fact that it hasn't impeded your impressive abilities to work.
thank you.
you know, I'm sorry that that all spilled out.
I'm-I'm not... I'm not really sure what happened.
that happens to me, too.
I hold things in, and then watch out!
good night, Dr. Brennan. Good night, Clark.
I think you should call me Temperance. At least when we're alone.
mm, Temperance.
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that.
but I'll try.
cam, Cam, Cam, Cam! Okay, stop saying my name like that.
I found traces of the same microscopic pollen on Trent's clothes as were on the box that contained Lana's remains.
so you're saying Trent dug up Lana Brewster's remains and left them on Dr. Brennan's front door?
well, that's a reasonable conclusion. Which means he didn't kill her.
that's not so reasonable. You think he wants to get caught for a murder he committed 18 years ago?
he shot himself. It seems like an admission of guilt to me.
I don't buy it.
cam? Oh, God.
I read your autopsy report on Trent McNamara. Yup.
cause of death: gunshot wound to the head.
I noticed that he had an avulsion fracture to the third distal phalanx of his left hand. Yes, his fingernail was ripped off.
probably from a sailing accident, reefing in a topsail or something.
Lana Brewster sustained the exact same wound.
these are very unique injuries.
I thought you might want to tell Dr. Edison for his Ghost Killer File, or whatever he's calling it.
so you think there's a possibility that Trent was killed by the Ghost Killer?
shouldn't we look at every possibility? All right.
don't you want to tell him yourself? I was going to, but something else came up, and then I thought we should do this your way.
my way? Yes.
it's your lab, so we should do things your way.
good night.
boom! Voila.
I'm not hungry. Yes, you are.
you just don't know it yet,here.
the inquest is going to rule that Trent McNamara killed Lana Brewster and then committed suicide.
but Lana Brewster and Trent McNamara both had their fingernail ripped off.
it's too coincidental.
what do you think? Uh, you know what?
I think we're gonna catch her.
her? That's what you said, "her."
but you believe me? Okay, look, if you don't trust the evidence that Trent killed himself, then I don't trust the evidence.
that's it? That's it.
now take a bite of that sandwich, eat up, it's good.
Mmm, good, right?
I was hungry. Mm-hmm.
you know me better than I know myself.
I do, right? I do. Kiss me.
good sandwich, huh? Right? I got your back.
big nimble hands.
Angela, I'm trying to piece together a skull.
you're doing a great job.
so I wake up this morning and he's sitting there ，right, no clothes on, just his bass it was creepy.
Angela, is this conversation really appropriate here?
sorry, but I'm into alive people.
anyway, Todd has a friend...
I thought you said he was creepy?
Todd, not the friend.
good news.
I hope this is work-related.
the anthropology journal is publishing our piece on the evolution of the coronal suture.
a worthy interruption.
you're supposed to bump my fist with yours.
Why?
I'm told it's a widely acknowledged gesture of mutual success.
I love it when you two impersonate earthlings.
okay, now, this is weird.
there's some guy in the lounge who asked me to give you this.
is he alive? Because that is an excellent start to a relationship.
I didn't put a mirror underneath his nose or anything.
he said you'd know who he was when you opened it.
okay, a guy who gets her to stop working.
this I have to see.
you left it at my place.
three years ago.
first time I've been in Washington. Thought I should return it in person.
why didn't you tell me you were coming?
what if you didn't take my call?
you're a big important author now.
you could come down here, you know.
you can come up.
halfway.
as always.
I hope you don't have any expectations.
do you?
civility.
I can handle that.
so why are you here?
george Washington university wants to talk to me about heading their anthropology department.
they'd be lucky to get you.
I assume they tried you first.
I already had a job.
this is like watching cars mate.
it's gotta be Michael.
Stires... her forensic anthropology professor from northwestern.
they were...
very, very close?
Dr. Brennan is my forensic anthropology professor.
does that mean...?
no.
seems like we should have dinner tonight.
catch up.
sounds reasonable.
Hey, Bones!
whoa... okay, put it here. Easy!
bones, I got a present for you.
straight out of an illegal ravine on a dump in Fairfax.
see, our forensic people confirmed it was human matter so rather than open it myself and risk being trashed by you for contaminating the evidence
I decided to bring the whole refrigerator to you.
all we need is a toaster oven.
body is going to be mostly decomposed.
which is my cue to leave.
this is where it gets fun.
all right, you can open it. All right.
Ooh... okay.
uh... he or she?
she.
late teens...early 20s.
I'm guessing she's been in the refrigerator for a year.
is there enough insect activity to help us be more precise?
there's always enough insect activity.
remove and clean the bones, Zack.
Michael, you can pick me up at 7: 30. I'll give you my address.
beautiful lab.
Thanks.
old friend?
old teacher.
Yeah, they're actually going to eat dinner after seeing this?
well, I hope it's not soup.
if she was his student and I'm her student, then it follows...
ain't gonna happen, Zack.
not in this universe.
here's a sketch of the victim.
her skull was intact, so it made it easy to work with.
I just got her dental records.
name: Maggie Schilling, 19.
then I guess you don't need this.
she was a dancer.
bone markers in her metatarsals.
to go from the freedom of dance to being crammed into a refrigerator...
I hope she was already dead when they shut the door.
he's hotter than you said.
any other ex-lovers come knocking on your door today?
the "ex" in ex-lover is not a variable.
it's a constant, like the speed of light.
save your dirty talk for the hunky professor.
I can assure you our relationship is purely platonic.
what we share is a love of science.
neither of us has the time or inclination for emotional complications.
sounds very reasonable.
Yes. I've got to get this data together for Booth.
sure.
have a good dinner tonight.
Maggie Schilling went missing 11 months ago.
parents got a ransom note demanding a million dollars.
negotiations, they dragged on for a couple of weeks.
then suddenly, all contact stopped.
the assumption was that the kidnappers killed her.
no visual physical trauma.
cause of death?
not yet. But there are stress fractures on both wrists.
and we have some people running chemical analysis and toxicity screens on the effluent in the refrigerator.
okay. Call me later.
I'm not working tonight. I have a dinner.
what? Wow.
I just assumed that the two of you would be eating off an autopsy table.
not tonight.
I was being...
tomorrow's fine. Call me tomorrow.
we missed our reservation.
Ah, well, that's the price we pay for scientific exploration and discovery.
you realize that this is just recreational, Michael.
of course.
I'm just impressed that we can just pick up where we left off like no time has passed.
time is an imposed construct.
nice to know we can rely on physics.
you really think you'll move here?
depends on the offer.
maybe I could get you a position at the Jeffersonian.
working for my old student.
would that be a problem?
we're better when we're not vying for dominance in the same arena.
I can't help it if I'm usually right.
does that mean you've closed the case on that girl in the fridge?
I found some stress fractures on the wrists. Not much else.
I will.
same old confident Brennan.
I'm sorry; is school in session?
old habits die hard.
she did fight, Michael.
they kept her... tied up like an animal.
but she fought.
that's how she got those stress fractures because she was bound and struggling.
I just...I keep seeing her face.
you know how it is.
using a refrigerator to hide a body...
it's kind of perfect, isn't it?
good way to remove the victim without being detected.
the rubber gaskets seal in the odor.
maybe the company should use that in their ads.
she's late. She's never late.
you worried about her?
I'm happy for her.
Why?
remember that time you were late?
Oh, yeah.
good morning, all.
you know you can take the day off.
you deserve one day.
michael wanted to take a look at our equipment.
I'm going to let that one go.
the guys wanted to meet him, anyway.
they could learn a lot from him.
you were Brennan's professor?
she was 23. An adult.
that's what Clinton said.
you run through a lot of students?
that was a long time ago, and Tempe was very advanced.
more colleague than student.
I'm a pretty advanced student.
no offense, but, um, I'm not interested.
no, I meant me and her...
Oh! Burned.
what have you found?
x-rays reveal low bone density.
and the parathyroid hormone levels are also low.
there's a medical condition called hyperparathyroidism...
symptoms include muscle weakness, brittle bones, yeah I know...
you may be premature with your struggle theory.
I doubt that.
you mean you don't want to be doubted.
I can take it.
the wrist fractures could have resulted from her medical condition.
unlikely. However...
or be an unrelated cause of nontraumatic fissures.
Non-traumatic? Look at these.
it's something to consider.
last thing you want to do is jump to conclusions without evidence.
I know how much you want to find who did this.
this seems like an appropriate moment to discuss human goop.
chemical analysis of the liver and kidney tissues reveals significant evidence of the narcotic hydromorphone.
also known as hospital heroin.
in what kind of concentration?
given her probable size and weight, its fatal.
Where'd you go to dinner last night?
we wound up staying in.
we need to know if that amount accrued over time or was delivered in one large dose.
you didn't come back to the lab, did you?
I made a frittata.
Oh, wow! He cooks, too. Can we share him?
we also need to know if the hydromorphone was administered intravenously or orally.
I should get going. I'm meeting the board of the university.
I'll call you after my appointment. It was nice meeting you all.
what? Is it so odd for everyone to see me with a man?
print out the levels of hydromorphone you found in her system...
I want you to find the overload point that could cause the stress fractures in her wrists and examine the left ilium.
there seems to be some degeneration on the edge.
I know it sounds terrible, but I hoped that she had just run away.
that way, I could believe she was still alive.
she started turning against us in high school.
did a lot of drugs.
we tried to help her...
sent her to rehab, therapy...
kids have a lot to contend with these days.
we didn't help her, not really.
we had nannies to raise her because we were so busy and we sent her to shrinks when she had problems instead of talking to her...
you can't blame yourself.
environment plays a huge role in development.
I'd like some pictures of Maggie so I could compare them with her remains.
pictures of her dancing would be most helpful, or swimming.
how do you know she danced and swam?
some things can't be erased from the body.
I'm sorry, but I need to ask you about your daughter's drug problems.
do you know what she was using?
alcohol, ecstasy, marijuana...
what about the narcoti chydromorphone?
hospital heroin?
doesn't sound familiar.
she had a thyroid condition.
was anything prescribed for that?
her endocrinologist might know.
we have to find who did this to Maggie.
we have to do this for her.
Maggie's condition didn't respond to medication.
I was trying to get her to agree to surgery when she disappeared.
what types of medication are we talking about?
furosemide, pamidronate. I tried various calcitonin.
what about hydromorphone?
there are no pain issues associated with hyperparathyroidism.
but I knew Maggie had a drug problem.
she was definitely interested in getting some opiates from me.
she bribed my office manager for samples.
I'm going to need your office manager's home address.
Ex-office manager.
she's going to be what you call a disgruntled employee.
I didn't give Maggie Schilling those samples.
she boosted them herself.
Barragan just blamed me so he'd have an excuse to fire me.
why'd he fire you?
because he's a horn dog.
I tried to keep things professional.
you know what I mean.
Dr. Barragan said that you were closer to Maggie Schilling than any other patient.
you meet her parents?
Yes.
then you know the poor girl was pretty much on her own.
we took her in.
he said that you went out together, that you took her to clubs.
well, we just felt sorry for her, you know?
she was lonely, so we showed her a good time.
...Pills, vodka, weed.
Mary wanted Maggie to go to meetings. You know, aa.
that's very kind of you, but let's talk about your new refrigerator.
Why?
mainly, I'd like to know what happened to your old one.
well, the fridge we found Maggie in is a match with the marks on the Costellos' floor.
they're sadomasochistic fetishists.
Yeah. Turned the basement into a "fun room.
seeking sexual gratification through the manipulation of power.
probably the oldest of fetishes, master-slave.
it's all about dominance.
well, this sort of thing only comes up when the bloom goes off the rose if you know what I mean.
I don't know what you mean.
you know, when the regular stuff, when it gets old you need to spice it up, it's over.
when the sex is good, you don't need any help.
that's for sure.
I'm sorry?
I was agreeing.
Yeah, well, don't, okay? It kind of freaks me out.
I was just saying that I, myself, feel no inclination toward either pain or dominance when it comes to sex.
are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure.
you can be very bossy.
look at him, huh?
Ooh! Look at him, all smiley. I'll bet he just loves these things.
but these could explain the stress fractures.
her bones were brittle from the disease.
struggling would cause the cracks we saw.
the handcuffs are consistent with the injuries to Maggie Schilling's wrists.
maybe she wanted to be cuffed. Do you ever think about that?
here's what I was thinking
female, dominant strapped for cash meets wealthy teenager on the outs with her parents convinces her submissive husband to hold her for ransom.
any proof, or is this story time?
you feed her pills to keep her quiet the negotiations, they drag on so she dies of an overdose before an exchange can be made.
you seal her up in a refrigerator dump her in a ravine and you and her honey go back to playing "tie me up" in the basement.
Maggie Schilling was legally an adult.
we don't deny she was in the house, even cuffed.
we don't deny there was a perfectly legal sexual relationship which, by its nature, got rough.
but Maggie was a willing participant.
and enthusiastic.
you have no evidence my clients killed her.
it's weird for you, huh?
being the one that's all locked up.
the way you come at me...
are you threatened, or do I turn you on?
now I'm the one who's hating psychology.
if you don't have anything but those cuffs my clients will be out of here in 24 hours.
I figured it out.
I was right about how she got those fractures.
I just don't have the time, Tempe. I have an appointment.
but I thought you'd want to see. The university can wait a few minutes.
it's not with them, it's with someone they want me to meet.
and if we start debating evidence, I'll definitely be late.
trust me, there's nothing to debate.
I can prove that Maggie Schilling was bound in fur-covered handcuffs.
we found strands of matching fur embedded in her wrists in the scaphoid and the lunate.
but you can't prove that she was involuntarily restrained.
Oh, yes, I can.
it's not a competition.
no, the olympics are a competition.
ours is a struggle to the death.
want to bet dinner?
Yes.
if we make it to a restaurant.
Hmm! Bet's on. You got ten minutes.
okay.
you trained her well, doc.
she's brilliant. A little cocky, though.
Yeah, tell me about it.
pretty good partner, though.
what you see is what you get.
it's a rare quality.
that's just between us, eh?
Dr. Brennan found marks on the medial malleoli, both left and right.
her legs were bound.
mirror erosion patterns from the bones rubbing together over time.
if this were the result of sex games the legs, they wouldn't be bound together.
well, come on, you know? Looking for a little nookie?
huh? Last thing you tie together are the legs.
I'm not convinced.
brittle bones from her thyroid condition.
the damage could have happened in a very short time.
we also found evidence of inflammation on her right humerus and ilium.
the bone abnormalities indicate pathosis from lying in one position for a long time.
the only reasonable explanation is long-term bondage.
decreased bone-density could have caused the inflammation.
this isn't definitive.
I hear there's a nice little French place near here I'd like to try.
I still have five minutes.
my department's still working with polaroids.
so, what do you think?
very impressive.
especially to the non-professional.
you want science? Give me the estimated time of captivity.
approximately three weeks.
okay, here are your affected areas.
now, during an advanced time simulation...
you're winning, right?
can I see your findings?
this appears to be indisputable.
the narcotic found in her system was not the result of recreational drug abuse.
the inflammation would have been very painful and the pain would have increased over time.
they kept upping the dose of hydromorphone until they gave her too much and she died.
those people bound and killed that girl.
I yield. French restaurant?
I'm more in the mood for Italian.
I need to put together the evidence packet for Booth to deliver to the U. S. Attorney.
I'll meet you at your place.
do you really think he can handle your success?
what, because of today? We've always been competitive.
I know, but he's a man and his student, a woman, has surpassed him.
michael is extremely secure, Ange.
honey, when you stuck it to him today, he was upset.
it was a healthy debate between scientists.
you don't know Michael.
I know men, and I know what happens when two people start sleeping together.
it's not like that. We're friends, colleagues, that's all.
colleagues with benefits.
I don't know what that means but Michael and I are not involved.
I'm sorry if that's difficult for you to understand but what we have isn't traditional.
don't talk to me about traditional, okay? I've dated circus people.
you and Michael, you have something and that's okay.
that's good, even.
just be honest about it.
judge is holding him without bail.
the U. S. Attorney is thinking about sending you flowers.
facts are facts.
uh, bones, I have to ask.
how much have you been sharing with the professor?
none of your business.
I mean, on the case.
Oh. I bounce everything off of him.
well, you got to keep him out of it from now on.
out of it? Why?
well, you know that appointment that he had today?
yeah?
he met with the Costello's lawyer.
michael is their expert witness.
it's his job to tear apart the case that you've built.
how could I not be upset? Basically, you were spying on me.
spying?
it's a criminal proceeding.
you're required by law to disclose all your findings to the defense anyway.
I'm only required to provide you with the raw facts we intend to enter into evidence.
not the process by which I arrived at those facts.
I apologize. That's a nuance that escaped me.
why didn't you just tell me, Michael?
because the defense isn't required to tell the prosecution anything.
in fact, it's grounds for a mistrial.
look, I've never done this before.
you're the teacher in this situation. I'm the student.
and a little competitive.
part of the job at the university is to be an expert witness and yes, I would like to do that job at least as well as you.
but if you feel I've overstepped some boundary here...
I'll back out of the case.
no.
but if you stay on, you have to move back to the hotel.
Really?
Yes.
well, would I have to do it tonight or should I order another bottle of wine?
I suppose tomorrow would be soon enough.
I apologize, Tempe.
he's still at it?
Yep. And it is fascinating.
keep an eye on him.
that's not going to be a problem.
did you just give Zack and Hodgins a sign of encouragement?
you know, that's the first time I've been able to look at them without imagining more knocking their heads together.
agent Booth, you're accessing your inner squint.
tempe, you listed an avulsion fracture on the right femur.
looks minor. Do you consider this evidence?
Dr. Brennan's conclusions belong to the prosecution.
I have no interest in destroying your case, agent Booth.
I'm just trying to get a sense of...
of her interpretations of data, to which you are not privy, Dr. Stires.
I understand the game the doctor is trying to play and I'm perfectly capable of dealing with him myself.
I'm sure he's just thrown by findings he would have missed.
this is not about you and Dr. Stires.
this is about the Jeffersonian's reputation as a source of expert witnesses.
okay, I'm on my own.
Oh, in the interest of fairness
I am willing to share my thoughts with you.
I've red-penciled a few things.
you corrected my findings?
consider it an opposing opinion.
my findings are based on facts, Michael, not opinion.
you seem to have finished your allotted with the remains, Dr. Stires.
I'd like my people to get back to work.
thank you.
bones, you okay?
why wouldn't I be?
because the nutty professor is grading your paper.
What'd he give you anyway, huh?
I was always happy with a "B.
well, I never got a "b" and I never will.
that's my girl.
assistant U. S. Attorney Levitt jury consultant Joy Deaver, Dr. Temperance Brennan.
nice to meet you.
I looked over your findings, and I think we're in good shape.
thank you. I was...
but juries don't like you.
excuse me?
I've seen you testify before, Dr. Brennan.
you come off cold and aloof.
I want to make sure... - cold and aloof?
try not interrupting. It makes you sound arrogant.
also, don't front-load your testimony with technical crap.
this really is not the best approach.
I'm a technical witness. I've testified in over 30 trials.
but most of the experts you've come up against are as dry and boring as you are.
now I don't know if you've seen their expert...
she's seen him, Ms. Deaver.
well, then you understand my concern.
professor Stires is open, charming, great-looking.
jury's going to love him. I love him.
this isn't a personality contest.
it's about data that we present to the jury.
you're kidding, right?
the women on the jury aren't going to be listening to a word that comes out of his mouth.
they're going to be undressing him.
I don't want the men on the jury to be putting more clothes on you.
wear something blue. It suggests truth.
make eye contact with the jury, and lose the clunky necklace.
Mary and Scott Costello murdered Maggie Schilling.
the forensic data I've compiled proves that. That should be enough.
but it isn't enough.
okay, that's... that's great.
we'll, uh... take that under consideration. Thanks.
why didn't she say anything about you?
you can be very irritating sometimes.
bones, she's an expert just like you.
she has an obvious personality disorder, but she wants to help.
just try.
okay, sure.
good.
I can do it.
we will show that Mary Costello lured Maggie Schilling into her home with the promise of drugs.
she was not held against her will.
she was, in fact, orchestrating the plot to extort money from her own parents from whom she was estranged.
they bound her for weeks, the pain growing and to keep her quiet they pumped her full of drugs.
her death was the result of a self-administered overdose.
after killing their captive and ruining their chances of collecting a ransom the Costello's stuffed Ms. Schilling's body into the refrigerator.
knowing they could be accused of kidnapping and murder my clients panicked and disposed of her body.
while their behavior might be ill-advised they are neither kidnappers nor murderers.
pharmaceutical samples of hydromorphone were found in the Costello's belongings.
the lot numbers matched those that were in Dr. Barragan's office...
when I went in the Costello's kitchen
I saw the marks from the old refrigerator on the floor.
it was like these marks--they screamed at me
these people, they did it.
objection.
sustained. Just the facts, agent Booth.
I'm sorry.
it's just that the receipt for the new refrigerator was dated two days after the negotiations broke off with the kidnappers.
you figure it out. I know. I'm sorry.
any evidence Maggie Schilling wasn't a willing participant in sexual activity involving those cuffs and other paraphernalia?
winding up in the fridge kind of tells me that she really wasn't that into it.
your honor? No direct evidence.
any evidence my clients forced Ms. Schilling to take that narcotic?
I'll leave those answers for the experts.
Sciarids, also known as dark winged fungus gnats went through several life cycles.
also present were acaridae and anoetidae but the most interesting find was not a bug at all but was common bread mold.
all of this data led to the same conclusion:
Maggie Schilling was in that refrigerator between 10 and 12 months.
even though we already had medical records and dental records from which to identify Maggie Schilling
I was also asked to do a sketch based on the architecture of her skull.
that's sort of what I do.
turned out pretty accurate, if I do say so myself.
she was a pretty girl.
that's why I drew her smiling.
it... it just seemed right.
I'm really sorry for what happened to her.
and I hope my work helps you.
the gelatinous puddle was decomposed tissue from which our lab extracted and analyzed liver and kidney samples by mass spectrometer.
the hydromorphone level in her liver was 8. 4 and 6. 6 in her kidney.
death occurs at 7. 7 and 5. 2, respectively.
and the reason they would be giving the victim this narcotic?
short-term periosteal reaction on the right proximal lateral humerus was consistent with a bound individual...
so to rephrase...
and the placement of wrist restraints coupled with her hyperparathyroidism would account for the stress fractures on the distal anterior surface of both the radii and ulnae.
her bones broke because she was struggling to free herself?
Yeah, I believe I just said that.
thank you, doctor.
that will be all for now.
I'd like to move for a recess with the right to recall the witness, your honor.
okay. We will meet back here in 30 minutes.
she can't connect.
those killers are going to walk.
it was well-reasoned.
Yeah, it was very scientific.
you didn't listen to a thing I said.
you were like klaatu the robot up there.
would it have killed you to speak English?
I wore blue. I looked at the jury.
look, for a people person, you're a little rude.
at what point do the facts stop working for you?
I have no problem with the facts as long as the jury can understand them.
you're underestimating their intelligence.
you're overestimating their ability to stay awake.
when these SM perverts walk on this, it'll be on your head.
can you believe that?
what, you agree with her?
not entirely.
not entirely? So, that means partly.
well, I was perfectly clear. Didn't you think I was clear?
sometimes. And, um...
sometimes you were...
a little hard to follow.
what are you talking about? When?
when you were... talking.
listen, bones, I know you care about this case but I think you should let them see that.
so I should perform?
just a little bit, yeah.
I mean, do you see how I portrayed myself as a no-nonsense, tough-guy cop?
you are a no-nonsense, tough-guy cop.
exactly.
and I think that it wouldn't hurt if the jury saw who you really are.
well, I don't know who you think that is, Booth because this is who I really am. Just this.
Oh, god, sorry.
I'm okay. Are you?
sure.
well, truthfully, this whole thing is pretty awkward.
don't you think?
we're just doing our job. We'll be fine.
it's just they have this jury consultant
they want to turn this into a melodrama.
they don't understand what a scientist is.
tempe, we're not allowed to talk about the case.
I know, I'm just saying...
my guy's going to freak if he sees us talking.
sure. Sorry.
in my opinion, the high levels of hydromorphone are more consistent with recreational use than for pain relief.
could you explain?
well, I might not use all the technical language but I'll try to make myself understood.
objection, your honor. The witness is impugning another witness.
sustained.
continue.
I'm sorry. I don't do this professionally.
people who need to relieve physical pain will stop after the pain disappears.
it doesn't take more than an average dose to accomplish that.
drug users are trying to bury emotional pain which means that they'll medicate until they feel nothing.
this is why they have a tendency to overdose, like Maggie Schilling.
that's not accurate.
sometimes intense chronic pain does not respond to medication.
I'll bring that up in cross-examination.
what about Dr. Brennan's claim that her pain was somehow connected to the victim being bound for a length of time?
well, the Costello's have already stipulated to the fact that they bound Ms. Schilling as part of their rather unorthodox sexual life.
and Dr. Brennan agrees that Ms. Schilling had hyperpara
well, if I could simplify
a thyroid condition that could weaken her bones.
no need to look for bondage scenarios.
that's ridiculous. He's ignoring all the facts.
with respect to my former student Dr. Brennan with findings like these
I don't know why she became a forensic anthropologist.
she seems to have ignored all but her preconceived notions about the case.
objection.
sustained.
I apologize.
do you disagree with Dr. Brennan's data?
well, sometimes doctors can use data to confuse a very simple situation.
I mean, I'm a doctor and I could hardly follow her.
this case is about people, not incomprehensible technical jargon.
I don't think that these people should be convicted of murder just because Dr. Brennan sounds smart.
your honor, really.
the jury will disregard professor Stires' personal view of Dr. Brennan.
court will adjourn until 9: 00 A. M. tomorrow.
he wasn't acting as an objective expert. He was making up a story.
the judge chastised him in front of the jury.
that'll work for us.
the hell it will. The jury loves Stires.
he looks like a regular guy who's not allowed to speak the truth because the stupid rules get in the way.
the rules of juris prudence aren't stupid.
Dr. Brennan, you need to learn the difference between reality and perception.
a trial is all about perception.
Wow. You are the reason civilization is declining.
talk to her.
I kind of agree with her.
Thanks.
I really don't agree with you
I just... I don't like her.
put me back on the stand.
I can rebut everything that Michael said.
she can do this.
I'll think about it.
I've never been in this position before, Booth.
I need to get back up there.
all right, just let me talk to him.
trial going badly?
you don't usually cram at the last minute.
the jury likes Michael better than they like me.
apparently, that's a problem.
are they stupid?
compared to you, yes, they are stupid.
however, compared to you, most of the world is a little stupid.
you have many skills, Temperance.
not one of them includes communicating with the average person on the street.
which is exactly what juries are made of.
I'm a better forensic anthropologist than Michael Stires.
which is why, two years ago, I hired you instead of him.
michael applied for this job?
Yes.
his credentials are better than mine.
Yes. But...
you are the more rational, reasoned, empirical scientist.
and you care.
and if he tries to convince you otherwise, tell him to go to hell.
is it safe to approach, Dr. Brennan?
don't charm, Michael.
I think you're taking this too personally.
you think I should be more rational?
Yes.
go to hell.
look, you're not the only one with a jury consultant.
the difference is, I listened to mine.
he told me to create reasonable doubt, that's what I did.
this one isn't about winning a pasta dinner or showing up your former student.
it's about putting two people away who murdered a 19-year-old girl.
tempe, you can't personalize the work.
do you remember, in central America standing in a mass grave being guarded by soldiers?
we knew that they were probably the same soldiers who killed the people we were digging up.
I was just a student.
I was scared, I turned to you and I asked, "what do we do?
that was a different place and a radically different context.
you said, "we tell the truth. We do not flinch.
you flinched, Michael.
I can't ask her that.
the whole line of questioning isn't relevant.
he brought it up during his testimony so legally you can reintroduce it.
I don't see how it's going to change anything.
trust me, it will.
am I testifying?
only a prolonged struggle, not sexual activity would cause the tearing of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle on the distal portion of the bone...
so, in lay terms.
the muscle avulsed.
she pulled a muscle.
because she was immobilized.
Tied-up.
Yes. These conditions have to be contextualized.
the inflammation on both the ilium and...
Dr. Brennan, why did you become a forensic anthropologist?
I beg your pardon?
there must be a reason you chose this field out of the hundreds of other careers someone of your intelligence could have chosen.
was there some emotional reason, perhaps?
objection. Relevance, your honor.
I don't see how this pertains to the case.
Dr. Brennan is cold, distant and alienating, your honor.
hey...!
I need the jury to understand why she's so cold so that they might be willing to accept her testimony.
her personality issues aren't relevant to this case.
they opened up this line of questioning, your honor.
when Dr. Stires was on the stand he wondered why Dr. Brennan became a forensic anthropologist so the defense must have thought it had some relevance then.
sorry, Mr. Meredith, you did raise the issue. Overruled.
you may continue, Mr. Levitt.
Dr. Brennan, your parents disappeared when you were 15
and no one's ever found out what happened to them, isn't that correct?
please answer the question, Dr. Brennan.
that's correct.
it must be very painful.
is it fair to say that you have been trying to solve the mystery of their loss your whole life?
do I want answers? Yes.
as to how that has affected my behavior which I assume is what you're trolling for
I don't put much stock in psychology.
is that why you wrap yourself up in techno speak?
so you won't have to feel how these victims remind you of your own parents?
how I feel doesn't matter. My job doesn't depend on it.
but it's informed by it.
or are you as cold and unfeeling as you seem?
I see a face on every skull.
I can look at their bones and tell you how they walked, where they hurt.
Maggie Schilling is real to me.
the pain she suffered was real.
her hip was being eaten away by infection from lying on her side.
sure, like Dr. Stires said the disease could contribute to that if you take it out of context.
but you can't break Maggie Schilling down into little pieces.
she was a whole person. Who fought to free herself.
her wrists were broken from struggling against the handcuffs the bones in her ankles were ground together because her feet were tied and her side, her hip and her shoulder were being eaten away by infection.
and the more she struggled, the more pain she was in so they gave her those drugs to keep her quiet.
they gave her so much it killed her.
these facts can't be ignored or dismissed because you think I'm...
boring or obnoxious. Because I don't matter.
what I feel doesn't matter. Only she matters.
only Maggie.
tempe, Tempe. Tempe, I'm sorry.
what can I do?
Costello's are trying to cop a plea to a charge that won't mean the death penalty.
they know they're going down.
you had no right.
there are things that are private.
Yeah, maybe you're right. But you know what?
this was my case, too. All right? So, nothing personal?
guilty on all counts.
Yeah.
so he owes you another dinner, huh?
no, I won't be seeing him anymore.
sorry.
I was foolish to be so open with him. It was irrational.
you know how you get when you're tired.
Yeah.
you want to go out, grab a drink?
I think I just want to work.
okay.
Hey, Bones.
what is it? I'm not feeling very forgiving.
Yeah, I know. But we have a case.
victim is an adult male, 35 to 40 years old.
from the pattern of the burning I'd say an accelerant was used.
could you hand me my bag?
Yeah. Sure.
Hey, listen, you want my coat or something? It's cold up here.
if I did, I'd ask for it.
Yeah.
sorry. And, um...
I'm sorry.
you had something to accomplish you found a logical way of getting what you needed.
I probably would have done the same thing.
these remains dating from the iron age, were found at the bottom of shaft three at the site.
there were five sets of human remains found.
this is the only one found whole.
he's in good shape.
1, 500 years old: He shouldn't look this good.
which is why we're here.
we're either going to authenticate the finest set of human remains from the iron age ever found, or dash the hopes of a thousand scholars.
let me know how it turns out.
but, dr. Goodman, this is extremely prestigious. Aren't you going to be a part of the team?
I have an institution to run. - Didn't you used to be an archaeologist?
Yes, Mr. Addy.
thanks for reminding me.
x-rays. Pictures.
we're gonna do this without touching the actual skeleton as much as possible.
kid gloves?
latex should be all right.
Zack, were you being metaphoric?
I decided to give it a shot.
which is also metaphoric.
I need a receptionist.
I can't have just anybody waltzing in here.
take a look at this.
a bunch of red circles?
each circle shows where a body part was found.
what is this, an airport? - Los Angeles international.
local pathologist says the remains are in pretty bad shape.
so he punted to the FBI.
airports, they fall under federal jurisdiction.
excellent use of the word "punt.
I can't go to Los Angeles, I have an iron age warrior to authenticate.
iron age warrior? Okay, when was the iron age?
1, 500 years ago.
no. Fresh body bits, just a little bit more urgent.
you do realize there are lot more fresh bodies than there are perfect specimens from the iron age?
and when you say things like that, it's just to bug me, right?
do we have to go through this every time?
exactly.
booth can't just walk in and say, - "pack your bags, we're going to L. A." - Oh, yeah, yeah. The whole ice age warrior thing.
iron age. - Iron age.
and that's not the only thing.
homeland security has just asked Dr. Brennan to identify three bodies found in...
I'm not allowed to say. - The point is, agent booth, Dr. Brennan is in great demand on several very pressing cases and she's needed here at the museum.
why should I send her to California?
sexy case in Hollywood?
how much more good press could the Jeffersonian get?
but, Dr. Goodman?
you said the iron age warrior was of the highest priority.
I can step in on that case.
you pack your bags.
this car doesn't feel very FBI-style.
Hey, Bones, this is a 1966 Mustang. It's a classic.
I mean, what goes better than that with the FBI?
how come on the rental agreement under "model" you made the guy write "sedan"?
come on. We're California.
look, palm trees.
Yeah, I'd like to drive sometime.
look, our contact out here is special agent Tricia Finn.
I'm an excellent driver.
okay, rainman. - I don't know what that means.
well, I'm always going to drive. You know that, right?
me behind the wheel, and you over there on the grandma side.
I'm not above telling deputy director Cullen what kind of car you rented.
do you want us to do something, or just stand here and watch?
I'm getting a feel for the fellow.
a feel? - Well, there's no bugs on him, haven't been for over a thousand years.
there may be spores and pollens, correct?
probably not.
dozens of species of pollens have been discovered from the cretaceous era
how long ago was that?
65 million years.
that was a pretty good comeback.
when authenticating a find like this, we have to be at the top of our game.
Yeah, well, we all know that you're gonna say, "I am unable to authenticate with confidence."
why would he do that? - When you declare something authentic, you run the risk of being proven wrong.
that doesn't happen if you equivocate.
as head of the Jeffersonian, Dr. Goodman will place the reputation of the institution over everything else.
I'm an archaeologist.
my findings will be congruent with the facts.
all due respect, you used to be an archaeologist.
I... have no idea what's going on between you two right now.
agent Finn, why was the body removed from the crime scene?
call me Tricia, Dr. Brennan.
the body was removed because parts were visible to arriving flights.
here's a map of the crime scene with a legend.
now, there's a marked cone at the location of each body part, and each photograph corresponds to a cone.
that's how they did it in your book.
she got that from me.
this is not a dismemberment.
are you sure, Bones? I mean, this is Los Angeles, you know? They're showy.
is it possible that the body parts were ground up in a landing gear and then dumped when the airplane landed?
the dispersal rate is wrong.
it looks to me like the body was pulled apart by... a pack of dogs.
more likely, coyotes. - Coyotes at the airport?
we've got coyotes everywhere. - Did you know that?
no, I thought coyotes were, you know, a cowboy thing.
I'd like to see the remains now.
I need all the dirt, silt, bits and pieces collected with the body parts, sent back to the Jeffersonian immediately.
you know what I like? When there's no flesh on the bones.
just a personal preference.
there's not much left, anyway.
you know, Dr. Brennan, as a screenplay writer myself,
I'd be happy to help you in any way I can with regard to your movie.
excuse me?
someone told me they're thinking of making your book into a movie.
say something, Bones.
well, all I know is I'm supposed to meet some big movie producer while I'm here
if I have time, which I probably won't.
does the pathologist need any further access to the remaining soft tissue?
no. He got everything out of it he could.
so my own screenplay is about this FBI agent who finds herself on the trail of a former boyfriend, and...
Oh... um...
God.
it's okay if you have to leave.
this is not good.
Yeah, thanks for that insight.
no.
I mean the architecture of the skull has been radically altered.
you mean rotting and being eaten by coyotes, and having the face ripped off by you?
no, by surgery.
lots of surgery.
I'm not sure I'll be able to tell who this was.
are you getting the feed, Zack?
Yes, Dr. Brennan, I'm looking at the x-rays you beamed me.
I'm going to have the bones cleaned, but there's still vestiges of flesh.
Hodgins got the clothing remnants and silt this morning.
are you there, Ange?
is it sunny, sweetie?
tell me it's sunny. - It's sunny.
I sent you the entire skull.
you want a reconstruction? - If you can.
if I can? Have I ever failed you?
this one's different; you'll see what I mean when you get it.
here, Dr. Brennan. - I make this a young woman.
early 20s from the look of the x-rays.
cause of death?
I see evidence of stabbing.
one hit to the sternum, two to the costal cartilages.
estimated time of death?
degradation of remains suggests the body was left out in the open between a week and ten days.
and the marks on the bones suggest carnivorous feeding beyond insects, birds and rodents.
coyotes.
they have coyotes? - Yes.
that would explain the dispersal of remains.
a pack of coyotes finds the body, pulls it apart, and spreads out to eat in solitude.
the teeth are veneered.
the jaw has been broken and reset. Same with the right leg.
have you seen any movie stars yet?
no, why?
apparently, it's a contest when you go to L. A.
in which the winner is the person who sees the most celebrities.
you have a whole skull, right?
Yes.
so, why is this going to be so difficult?
you'll see.
Ange, on the iron age project, Goodman does this thing. Hodgins isn't going to like it.
what thing? - He theorizes, in a way.
it sounds like he's making stuff up.
it's hard to explain, but it's going to irritate Hodgins.
honey, you're in California.
forget the iron age.
say these words: "Sky bar."
go there tonight. Tell me everything.
Dr. Brennan, one of these x-rays shows two dark clumps near the pelvis.
behind what's left of the spleen?
I've got a list of missing persons: Women in their early 20s.
Oh, do I really have to be here for this part?
you think she swallowed that?
could be because she was a drug mule.
it's an implant.
breast implant.
those come with serial numbers?
we should be able to identify our victim in a couple of hours.
unlike other burials of the time in which the remains were found in a semi-fetal position, this fellow was found on his back, arms at his sides, with a piece of decorated antler on his chest.
do you actually need me here?
the antler honors him as a hunter, although his weapons tell us he was a warrior.
he was in his mid-30s when he died.
he was 1. 88 meters tall.
you know, there's all the detritus from Brennan's Hollywood crime to sift through.
6'1"?
a big man for his time.
feared by his foes, respected by his neighbors.
they encourage that much conjecture in archaeology?
his bones bear the marks of battle.
his weapons are of good quality, well-used.
he was old for a warrior. Yet, how did he die, Mr. Addy?
looks like tuberculosis.
a proud man.
it was not the ending he would've wanted.
yet he was surrounded by family and friends.
a good death. - Oh, please.
now you're describing a scene from lord of the rings.
I liked that movie.
he was buried with respect.
weapons, jewelry.
his family did not stint or pilfer.
have you found any spores or fungi, Dr. Hodgins?
Yes.
they correspond both with the time he lived and the geography in which he was found.
what?
I'd like details.
you mean like a written report? - Yes.
our findings will have to bear scholarly scrutiny from our peers.
what's his problem?
my hotel doesn't even have a pool.
well, you're welcome to use mine.
well, the breast implant lead went nowhere.
well, what about the serial numbers?
the implants were reported stolen six months ago.
our victim must've gotten them off the black market.
there's a black market in breast implants?
Yeah, we have the name of the doctor from whom the implants were stolen.
what use is a black market breast implant?
back-alley plastic surgeons use them.
they're not even real doctors
are you gonna write the screenplay?
what screenplay?
the one based on your book.
well, I guess, maybe the producer I'm meeting will tell me.
okay, guys let's turn our attention back to the murder victim.
I'd like to go pay a visit to Dr. Boobs.
Why? If implants were stolen from him, he won't know anything.
because it's the only lead that we've got, Finn.
and leads are great for screenplays, or even, say, if you're working a real case.
I have something for you.
is it chocolate?
no.
then I find my interest has flagged.
nice.
who is it?
it's the Hollywood murder victim.
Oh, my god.
I see what Brennan means.
this woman has had a lot of surgery.
what's with Goodman and Hodgins?
they're guys.
they should just lay 'em out on the table and measure.
lay what out on the table and measure?
okay. Awkward moment.
let's just say they have different approaches.
and they're guys, okay?
I'm a guy.
you're more highly evolved.
this girl didn't just change her face, she changed her skull.
this is gonna make Brennan nuts.
you know one thing. - What's that?
she's gonna be beautiful.
why would anyone go through all this pain and not end up beautiful?
do the names Michael Jackson or Joan Rivers mean anything to you?
one of them.
the other I'll look up.
every culture nurtures ideals of beauty toward which people strive.
fine, but in the future people will look back upon the surgical alterations of the nose or breasts or buttocks with the same horror that we regard the binding of feet or the use of bronze coils to extend the neck.
you want to speak up?
because it's really hard to hear every word in this very, very quiet waiting room.
it's barbaric. It's painful.
it's wrong.
this murder victim may never be identified because some glorified barber with a medical degree had the arrogance to think that he could do better than millennia of evolution.
do you know what producer you're meeting with, Dr. Brennan?
no, my publisher didn't give me a name.
I don't know what a producer does specifically.
nobody does.
but it's really important.
Dr. Kostov will see you now.
you can remain here, agent Finn.
Yes, sir.
you recognize this, Dr. Kostov?
that'd be your high-profile double-lumen full "c" saline.
Yeah, it's from a shipment of implants you reported stolen six months ago.
I have a hard time believing you're returning one implant to me.
I found it in the remains of a murdered girl.
have any more of those stolen implants been recovered?
Yeah, approximately three weeks ago.
there was a faulty one that had to be removed by a surgeon out in the valley.
from whom?
a Heidi. - I don't know what that means.
l. A. Speak for call girl.
LAPD was investigating. They can tell you what agency the girl was working for.
you have the most beautiful bone structure.
I can't take credit. It's genetic.
how old are you?
why do you want to know?
well, it's never too early to watch problem areas.
the jaw, little pouches beneath the eyes.
do you mind?
you touch her she'll break your arm.
she thinks what you do is...
barbaric.
don't look at me. I like my face the way it is.
sweetie, I'm having a hard time with this skull.
did you try filling in the surgical scoring?
I can't be definitive.
all the usual indicators have been modified.
I made three variations of facial reconstructions.
she had her cheekbones shaved, her chin changed, her jaw reconstructed.
that's just what she did to her bones.
we don't have a clue what she did to the soft tissue.
her nose, her brows, her cheeks.
just start with her basic architecture. We'll go from there.
the basic architecture is what I can't find.
you're gonna have to make a best estimate.
did you just tell me to guess?
no, I said make a best estimate based upon your experience and expertise.
okay, well, dress it up however you want, but it's still a guess.
look, my experience and my expertise don't extend to this.
a facial reconstruction might not be helpful in this case.
Angela, I told you it'd be hard.
just do what you can.
okay, Brenn, you're being a little edgy and tart with me.
and all I'm trying to do is tell you the truth.
what this young woman did to herself
it's as if she completely removed her own identity.
who hates herself so much that she not only changes her looks, but her core architecture?
if we don't know who she is then how will we be able to catch the person who murdered her?
is that your way of apologizing?
Yes, Angela.
I accept.
I love your guts, sweetie.
according to LAPD a black market breast implant from the same shipment showed up in another girl from Aphrodite escorts.
are you missing anyone?
we're not looking into your business, Ms. Bardu.
we're just trying to solve a murder.
I haven't heard from Rachel in two weeks.
is that unusual?
I prefer to ask the questions my own way, agent Finn.
Thanks.
Rachel booked out at a one-week rate.
she knows to check in with me if the client wants to extend the contract.
it's time to worry.
do any of these women resemble Rachel?
if I had to pick one, this is the closest, but not really.
Rachel have a last name?
Rachel wasn't even her real first name.
she goes by Rachel Lachance.
Rachel went to Vegas with a long-time customer.
I need his name.
ms. Bardu, it's always the same story
a beautiful young woman.
somebody wants to meet her.
somebody can't have her. Somebody dies.
Dr. Anton Kostov. An assembly-line nip/tucker in town.
if that's all...
do you have a card, Ms. Bardu?
we provide a law enforcement discount.
ms. Bardu, do you have any idea what Rachel looked like before her plastic surgery?
which time?
the skull is in extremely good shape.
cranial measurements are congruent with ancient Saxons, Celts and pre-Aryans.
which matches the location of the find.
I used Saxon tissue depth for the markers.
however, every skull requires its own unique demands.
are you certain of your calculations, Ms. Montenegro?
a lot more certain than I am on Brennan's Hollywood hooker case.
this is a Pict.
Picti actually means "painted ones" in Latin.
the Romans feared them.
very little was written about them or by them.
fierce warriors, falsely reported to be small in stature.
he's a Pict. So what?
the Picts are from the far, far north of the British isles, far above Hadrian's wall.
the remains were found at an archaeological site in southern England, near Wales.
a Pict can't go for a walk?
these remains represent an archaeological anomaly.
this is unique in that no Pict has ever been found in this area before.
if we can remove the clothing and take a closer look at the bones...
it's a face.
maybe Angela got it wrong. - Hey!
or Zack screwed up the measurements. - Hey!
this whole Pict business sounds like one of your stories.
enough
are you trying to get fired?
science is no country for storytellers, baby.
