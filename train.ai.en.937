and I just wanted to tell you that.
that's all.
well, okay.
and i've missed you, you know, since we broke up.
we didn't break up, chris.
you're right.
look, I'm just the way I am, you know?
and you got to just accept people, right?
maybe, um...
we can get a drink sometime?
no, thank you.
no, thank you"?
that's a very polite no.
are sure you don't want to make it an impolite "yes?
I am.
you know, you're a sweet guy, chris.
and you're handsome.
deep down.
good night. - good night.
a b d e f g i j k l m
Hi, marth...
you wore it.
Yeah.
the table looks great.
thank you.
are you okay?
that was, uh...
that was distracting me.
okay.
you're a very kind person, martha.
okay.
that's all suspicious foreign nationals who've come through east coast immigration in the past week,
correlated with where they're staying here
hotels, with relatives, it's all there.
this is just what I need, martha.
that's great, honey.
Yeah.
I'm gonna count to five.
one...
please, se? Or!
two...
three...
you're not here to shoot me, I suppose, or else I would already be shot.
so, who sent you?
the same people who sent you.
and what are you doing here?
your orders have been revoked.
we're here to make sure you comply.
I don't know you.
you were hired by the kgb.
they've changed their mind.
we don't want to kill someone our own people hired.
but that's the other option.
take a look on the back.
directed charge.
surprisingly quiet.
I like to think ahead.
now, the two of you are going to put your guns down on the count of three.
one...
...two...
we can get past this. It doesn't have to be like this.
it is like this.
we didn't take a vow to be unhappy.
before you worked for counterintelligence, stan, what do you do?
different things.
drugs? Robbers? - some of that.
you are cops.
policemen in your hearts. Yes?
sometimes I wonder if you understand spies.
I think I understand pretty well.
what do you want with us?
one day, with arkady, and the others at the rezidentura
do you want to put them in jail?
that's how policeman thinks, not how spies think.
we want everyone to stay.
right where they are.
and bleed everything they know out of them.
forever.
today, arkady called me into his office.
asked questions.
I thought,"this is the end.
they're going to send me to moscow for trials, execution.
instead, it was for promotion.
I report to arkady now.
maybe I will see the directorate "s" files.
find your illegals for you.
so, you'd go into those files for us?
this is how it is.
your boss will not let me out if I do not.
you didn't have to tell me that.
I cannot lie to everyone.
too dangerous.
milbank, you're late.
15 minutes.
big deal.
shift starts when the shift starts.
my wife's gonna kill me.
sorry.
how's the scientist doing?
he spent the last three hours explaining the difference between particles and waves to me.
you're in for a real treat.
tell billings I'm in the car.
come on.
I got to call you back.
leon billings was inside, too.
he didn't survive, either.
a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p t u v w x y z
if we start killing scientists on U. S. soil, who knows where it leads?
at best, the secret war escalates.
at worst...
he got one of the scientists.
God damn it.
this is our worst failure in 15 years.
I swear to God, they'll pay.
this will not stand.
I've been so stressed lately.
you know I could get anything that Agent Gaad has.
Oh! What?
you just... you startled me.
did something happen between you and Irina?
philip: Nothing happened. There's only you.
I asked you not to lie to me.
I made a terrible mistake.
can we please just... Try and start over?
no. We can't.
can I have another piece of fried chicken?
Elizabeth: Of course.
me too.
uh, white or dark meat?
white. - Paige: Dark.
there you go. - Thank you.
Thanks. - Mm-hmm.
I wish we could have fried chicken every week.
twice a week. Every day.
your dad and I, um...
want to talk to you guys about something.
Oh, my God.
you're too old.
I'm too old for what?
to have a baby.
you're having a baby? - No.
no. Where did you get that idea?
you just said... - No, no.
are you going on a business trip?
no.
you're separating?
well, no, we're not...
we're not separating, not exactly.
for how long?
I don't know. We don't know.
you're kidding, right?
I mean, this is a joke, isn't it?
Why?
your dad and I have...
you know, we've been fighting a lot.
you always fight a lot.
too much. - Philip: We know.
then stop.
we can't. - Tried.
when Henry and I fight, you tell us to stop.
if we can, why can't you?
I don't know.
the important thing is...
other than the fact that we love you so very much,
do you guys not love each other anymore?
it's... it's complicated.
bullshit! - Paige...
you don't just stop loving someone!
are you gonna stop loving us?
no. That is... I mean, it's impossible.
that would never happen. Never.
this is so stupid.
this is your fault! You're always giving dad a rough time!
it's not mom's fault.
why are you defending her?
I'm not. Look, this is...
our decision.
we... we both made this decision.
Henry, please open up. I just want to talk.
I love you so much.
more than you'll ever know.
so, I'll see you tomorrow at the Beemans'?
I got fresh meat, fresh meat.
you want a dog? - Yeah, I'll... I'll have one.
Paige, do you want a hamburger?
no.
rough night?
no one is doing particularly well right now.
Paige slept in Henry's room.
how is Henry?
not great.
where are you staying?
motel in Peterborough.
that sounds depressing.
it's okay for now.
it's for the best.
Yeah, I know.
I suppose we should mingle.
Hey, how you guys doing?
Gaad: We're doing great. That's a big old...
that's a big, old plate of meat you got.
Yeah. Sit. Rest your dogs.
Oh! Funny man!
all right.
so, we're gonna do something.
we're gonna take one of them out right here in D. C.
they're on the boards...
is this approved?
if anyone should ask, no.
who's the target?
the acting KGB Rezident.
that's a big target.
they just killed three of our own.
if we don't hit them hard and fast, those won't be our last casualties.
how's it going down?
arkady likes to jog Monday and Wednesday afternoon.
he's back in his office at 5: 00.
when? Tomorrow.
and, uh, this is not an assignment.
participation is strictly voluntary.
I'm in.
me too.
I'm sorry, if this is extrajudicial...
I would rather stay away.
okay.
what's up with your brother?
he looks like he lost his best friend.
he did.
my parents are taking a vacation from each other.
my dad moved out last night.
for good?
who knows?
they say they're hitting the pause button, whatever that means.
okay. All right.
sorry.
only one way to stop a bully, Stan.
I can't go in on this, Chris. I can't.
your shoes squeak. I get it.
me? My shoes... they don't squeak.
I'm fully lubricated.
who's, um...
who's the babe?
not your wife... the other fox?
that's my neighbor.
that's your neighbor? Mm-hmm.
I'd borrow some sugar if I was you.
you're a putz.
you know, I was sitting by the window the other night, and I was reading, and I saw Philip leave.
I mean, I wasn't spying.
no, no. Of course not.
is everything okay with you guys?
we are taking some time apart.
but I guess that's not something you can keep quiet for very long.
no. Um, why would you want to?
privacy, I guess.
there's no shame in it.
do the kids know yet?
we told them last night. - Oh.
well, you know, if you need anything, you don't hesitate to ask me, okay?
Thanks. Yeah.
dad, I want you to come home.
we both do.
I-I can't.
Paige: Why not? I...
I just can't, sweetheart. Please?
I'm sorry.
see you soon.
Ooh, shoot yourself into me, Clark!
Oh! Take me!
Oh, God, take me!
I have to go. There's a situation with the department.
what's going on?
three Agents got killed and a scientist.
I know. Everyone's upset.
Yeah.
I'm in love with you.
I waited my whole life for you, and I would do anything for you.
anything.
all you have to do is ask.
just please...
just tell me one thing?
is this real?
Yes.
Yes.
well, then, stay with me.
please.
just this once.
Where's Henry?
how should I know?
what should I tell my friends?
why do you have to tell your friends anything?
if they ask.
which is what?
that your parents aren't living together right now.
Henry, get down here right now!
we're gonna be late!
rise and shine, sleepyhead.
it's been a long time since I've had a man sleep in my bed.
I think I can get used to this.
but I got to go to work.
what's the rush?
well, there's a lot going on.
he thinks that I don't know, but...
I'm his secretary, not his potted plant.
what are they planning?
well, I think they're gonna kill a KGB Agent.
it's an eye for an eye, Clark.
but you
can stay as long as you like.
Mm. Bye.
Bye.
can I help you?
I don't know.
I'm with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
can I ask you a few questions?
about what?
why don't we start with who you are?
w-who I... I'm... I'm just a guy.
Yeah, you're just a guy who spent the night with a girl... Martha.
Oh, look, my friend, I don't...
I'm not your friend, friend.
what are you doing here?
you know what? You got me dead to rights, 'cause me and Martha...
we've been banging each other into ecstatic oblivion for the past... wow... 10 hours.
look, why don't we take this conversation downtown?
lock up your car.
okay.
holy shit.
no, no.
no. No!
what happened?
he followed me coming out of Martha's.
I need to go back and move his car.
I've seen him before. Yeah.
at the Beeman party.
he's FBI.
does he know you're working Martha?
I don't know. I suppose.
uh, or this just could be a...
what? What?
a total screw-up.
he might have been seeing Martha himself.
a jealous suitor?
but I got something from Martha.
the FBI are planning retaliation.
they're gonna kill a KGB Agent here in D. C.
he'll know what they're planning. - Yeah.
I brought morphine.
he needs to be in a hospital.
we'll do what we can.
the wound's pretty deep.
we're gonna have to pack it or cauterize it once we take the knife out.
you seen Amador?
no. He was supposed to meet me an hour ago.
he never showed.
it's not like him.
Amador: You've reached Amador.
if I'm not working, I'm out having a ball.
leave it at the beep.
Hey, it's Stan.
where the hell are you?
call me.
What'd you do with his car?
all right.
ready? Yeah.
okay, lift him.
okay. Put him down.
it's all right. It's over. The hard part's over.
thank you.
you've reached Amador.
if I'm not working, I'm out having a ball.
leave it at the beep.
woman: Hey, it's Cheryl.
we met at the crab shack.
I thought we could get together again.
you have my number, right?
Hello, Amador. This is Julie.
I'm in town for a few days and wanted to see if we could catch up.
call me, cutie.
woman #3: Chris, aunt Lyla's coming for dinner tomorrow.
I told her you're busy, but you know what she's like.
you and papa can watch the game on TV, okay?
so, you'll come?
good?
come.
Hey, it's Stan.
where the hell are you?
there's just no way that Amador would check out like this, without touching base.
he didn't answer his phone. He didn't show up this morning.
I went to his apartment. He hasn't been home all morning.
his car was around the corner from his apartment.
I had forensics check it out. Gaad: And?
no prints.
none.
what? He wiped his own prints off his car?
we don't know that the KGB has him.
I know it. Look, I've got every available Agent out looking for him.
if he spent the night out on the town and woke up in the wrong room...
I'm telling you, that's not what's happening.
or if the KGB does have him, we'll find him.
let's not jump to conclusions.
let's just do our job.
I have to get back. The kids are gonna be home from school.
Yeah, go, go. I'll, uh...
I'll give him some more morphine when he wakes.
there's nothing else we can do now.
okay.
Yeah, I'm like Picasso...
only with a gun and not a brush.
my work is my life, and my life is my art.
I have no wife, no kids, no pets, no hobbies, no distractions...
except for pussy.
I got no attachments.
I'm as unencumbered as bedbugs in a flophouse, and I like it.
it works for me.
Yeah. I am a lone wolf.
that's good, Stan.
anybody home?
could use some help.
I got Mac and cheese and those pretzels that you love, the ones that are as hard as rock candy.
and I bought a wok.
what for?
to make Chinese food.
you've never made Chinese food.
first time for everything.
is that what this is about?
you and dad split, and you start...
cooking Chinese food?
so we'll have spaghetti and meat sauce, then.
I don't care what we eat, and I don't want to pretend that your life is a do-over, because mine isn't.
so that's what you don't want. What do you want?
I want things to be the way they were.
I know.
Paige, I know things are hard right now.
but it's for the best.
for who?
Hello? Mrs. Costa: Hello, Mrs. Jennings.
this is Mrs. Costa, Henry's teacher.
Mrs. Costa? No.
is this a bad time? Uh... This is...
no, this is not a bad time.
Henry, you okay?
Yeah.
tired?
I just got a call from Mrs. Costa.
you have something you want to tell me?
no.
I know this is...
a terrible thing to do to you right now.
my parents... wouldn't have even considered it.
it would have been unthinkable.
but times have changed, and your dad and I...
Mrs. Costa said you didn't do your social-studies project.
I did.
are you saying she's not telling the truth?
show it to me, please.
is this it?
Yeah.
but you only wrote one sentence.
I didn't have anything else to say.
the KGB wants to know what your next move is.
they don't think you're just going to sit back after losing your scientist and three of your Agents.
has something happened?
who put the finger on Amador?
who?
my partner.
I don't know what you're talking about.
don't lie to me, Nina.
do not lie to me. - You're hurting me!
do not lie to me. - I don't know! I swear! Let go.
I don't know. I swear I don't know.
you find out who took Amador.
you find out where he is.
now.
water.
more?
cold.
what do you want?
information.
who are the FBI planning to take out?
I don't know.
I think you do.
this is Ms. Kendall.
arkady will be leaving the Rezidentura in one hour.
in approximately 1 hour and 14 minutes, from your post at the interception point.
if he raises his newspaper, that will be your signal that the target is in the field.
but if Agent Samuels drops his paper at any point, we will abort the mission.
because of the high value of the target, any decision to take action will be verified by us through the signal.
any questions?
I'm glad you're with us.
any word on Amador?
we're still working on it.
if we'd hit the KGB earlier, they wouldn't have him.
maybe. Who knows?
listen, if we kill Arkady, we're signing Amador's death certificate.
we have to take him alive.
there's something else we have to consider.
amador knows the name of your mole in the Rezidentura.
if the KGB has him and he talks, she's finished.
Why?
he was staring out the window all day, was not participating, not talking in class.
how's Paige? She hates my guts and isn't shy about letting it be known.
I'm sorry.
how's Amador?
he's weak, but he's awake.
says he doesn't know anything.
he's lying. I know.
they're gonna be looking for him all over town.
we have to get the hell out of here.
no. He's too weak to move.
we can't wait for him to come around.
we need information, and we need it now.
it's my turn to try.
we've met before.
I don't think so.
I would have remembered.
in a bar.
we both had too much to drink.
and we screwed our brains out.
you couldn't get enough of me.
and you?
I came and went.
I don't know anything about a hit.
if I did, I'd tell you, baby.
Scout's honor.
we both know that's not true.
you're gonna lose this war.
you know that, right?
you can torture me...
and you can kill me...
but we're gonna kick your motherland's marbled ass, and there's nothing you can do about it.
he's en route.
okay. We're good to go.
stand by.
Where's Arkady?
abort.
abort!
grab him.
our orders are to stand down.
to hell with that. Grab him now.
What?!
just keep your mouth shut. Move, move.
God damn it, Beeman.
what the hell did you think you were doing?
they got my partner.
what would you have done?
go on. We'll get into this later.
uncuff him.
and his mouth.
do you Hunt?
I don't understand.
do you Hunt...
you know, shoot. Kill things... animals.
no.
when you shoot a bird... duck or pheasant, say...
your dog, your retriever, picks it up in its mouth... its soft mouth.
soft mouth is key...
otherwise, the dog sinks his teeth into the bird's flesh.
anyway your dog brings it to you and lays it at your feet.
but sometimes, when you shoot the bird, it's not dead.
it's just wounded.
strange thing is, whether the bird is dead or just wounded, once the dog gets it in its mouth, the bird goes limp.
like a rag... doesn't move.
it acts like it's dead.
doesn't struggle or scream.
it just... Goes limp.
don't you think that's strange?
you know what I think it is?
fear.
the bird's scared out of its goddamn mind.
who wouldn't be? I know I would.
then again, maybe the bird is faking.
you know what I'm saying?
maybe it wants you... talking about the bird now...
to think it's dead so when the dog drops it out of its soft mouth at its master's feet, it can take off.
it works sometimes.
you wouldn't think it does, but it does.
not a lot.
I don't know anything.
please... I swear.
you're scared. I know.
I would be, too, because I've got you in my soft mouth, and you're not dead... not yet.
maybe you think you can run when I drop you at my master's feet.
maybe you can. Maybe you will.
but the thing is, you have my partner.
if you don't tell me where he is, you will never get dropped at my master's feet.
my bite will go hard, and you will know you are dead before your heart stops beating.
please, please,
I swear, I'm a diplomat.
I don't know.
please.
please.
I need morphine.
you'll get morphine when you tell me what I need to know.
what time is it?
it's after 5: 00.
Arkady.
what?
Arkady.
the Rezident is the target.
too late.
he's already dead.
soviet embassy. May I help you?
I need to talk to the head of cultural affairs.
what is this in reference to?
I have information about Vladimir Kosygin.
one minute, please.
Hello?
to whom am I speaking?
I have him.
your man. Vlad.
he's nobody. He has nothing for you.
well, that's probably true.
so, then, let him go.
well, it doesn't work like that.
tell me, how does it work?
Amador... release him.
this man...
I do not know.
listen to me. Listen very carefully.
I'm listening.
if anything happens to amador, vlad is dead.
I will personally send you his balls
to wear around your neck at your next may day parade.
hello.
Hello!
Arkady? - Yes.
arkady is alive and well.
how do you know? - I called the Rezidentura, I spoke to him.
so we need to contact Grannie. - I did.
she said there was a different target.
vladimir Kosygin, a first-tour officer.
went out for a run, never came back.
what I don't understand is why.
why would Amador lie about Arkady being the target?
he fingers the head of directorate's
to protect a first-tour officer?
it doesn't make any sense. He's playing us.
he's hiding something else.
what are you gonna do?
whatever it takes to get him to talk.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I didn't want this to happen, but it happened.
things just got a little crazy, you know?
Yeah.
I wouldn't let a dog suffer like this.
would you?
no.
after he talks give him the morphine.
just let him drift off.
all right, Chris. No more time.
we need to know what you're holding back, and we need to know...
goddamn it.
I'm gonna pull every Agent.
this will be the top priority.
it's family.
how did he die?
slowly... he was stabbed.
he was dead before they dumped him here.
what's strange is, that whoever did it then took the trouble to try and save him.
it's probably to late to exfiltrate your girl in the Rezidentura.
amador didn't give her up.
everybody talks, it's biology.
he didn't give her up.
gonna risk her life on that?
and mine.
vietnam turn you into a skirt chaser?
I was straight as an arrow when I signed up.
was an altar boy till I was seventeen.
Really? - Yeah.
vietnam changed things.
it was crazy shit over there.
you never knew when your number was gonna be called.
I learned two things,
one, "Tempus Fugit... "time flies.
one way or the other, you snatch it, or it's gonna snatch you.
there's no pause button.
and, two...
there are worse things than dying.
like? - Shame.
shame is not an option for me.
I don't understand
how that has anything to do with you chasing pussy.
pussy is a thing, and it's not a thing Stan.
it's real and it's not.
it's a metaphor.
for what?
the whole enchilada.
thank you.
what are you going to do?
eat.
enjoy.
so you're KGB right?
come on we both know it's true, I just wanna hear it.
Yes.
but I don't know anything.
I believe you.
that's good huh?
mm, nothing beats American fast food.
it's probably filled with all kinds of nasty shit that'll kill you, but man...
it sure taste good.
a drink?
yes please.
think I have a Cola here.
look what the cat dragged in. - Look at the cat.
she came to visit me a month before Paige was born.
this is his turf, man. No way we find him.
stop!
out of the way!
did something happen between you and Irina?
nothing happened.
I asked you not to lie to me.
I made a terrible mistake.
can we try and start over?
no. We can't.
you're separating? - Not exactly. We're, uh
hitting the pause button.
can I help you?
I'm with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
you find out who took Amador.
you find out where he is.
so, you're KGB, right?
Yes.
you want something to drink?
I didn't want this to happen, but it happened.
things just got all crazy, you know?
don't.
what? - Replay it in your mind
what you could, would, or should have done differently.
Yeah, well... home sweet home.
doesn't look so bad.
let me know when you want to switch.
Philip-- - Go home.
we both need rest.
I just spoke to Amador's parents.
they're arriving tomorrow.
and they're very appreciative of, uh, all of your thoughts.
Martha will let you all know details of the funeral services when we have them.
so...
um, I knew Chris when he started here at CI.
he's a-- he was a good agent, good friend, just a good man.
I'm sure that you all have your own stories about him.
I was a little hard on him sometimes, but he did a lot for this department and for this country.
and now here's what we're gonna do for him.
we are gonna take every resource we have, every ounce of energy and focus, and we are going to hunt for whoever is responsible for what happened to him.
and we are not going to rest until they are behind bars.
or even better, until we zip them up in a body bag.
Hey, I'm so sorry.
thank you.
he was just... - What?
just the other night he was...
he was asking me out again. That's all.
after he
that man, he could drive a woman crazy, you know?
Yeah, he sure could.
he was very fond of you, Martha.
me too.
agent Gaad wants to see you in the vault.
would you excuse me?
anything on the ring? - Not yet. Have a seat.
look, it wasn't on his body, and it wasn't in his apartment.
he always wore the ring.
we're on it. If it's out there, we'll find it.
well, it is out there. - Sit.
look, I know that the Rezident was the target, but if we don't hit these guys and they start killing at random
Stan, no one is accusing you of anything.
I'm on your side. We're in a war now.
it may be a secret war, but it's a war.
we have to fight like soldiers now.
and you're one of our best.
well, it doesn't feel like it tonight.
I don't imagine it does, no.
but in a war, blood gets spilled.
that's how it goes.
so, don't think twice about what you did.
understand?
now go home. Get some rest.
I'd rather stay and work the case, if it's all the same to you, sir.
the entire Bureau is working the case.
if anything breaks, I'll let you know.
tomorrow morning, signal your source and see what the hell she knows about Amador.
now go. That's an order.
Yes, sir.
yeah?
open up!
you up for a nightcap?
sure. Come on in.
how-- how did you know I was here?
if I can't find a travel agent staying in a motel under his own name, then I'm in the wrong line of business.
Elizabeth told Sandra.
right, right.
well, make yourself comfortable. I'll throw on some sweats.
no offense, Phil, but this place is kind of depressing.
Yeah, I know.
it's a shithole.
well, it's temporary.
Yes, it is.
everything is.
everything's what?
temporary.
I'll drink to that.
can I-- can I have one of those?
sure.
Cheers. - Cheers.
you know that?
I did not.
Yeah, before-- before, when I was working undercover.
no matter what city I was in, it was pretty much the same room.
lumpy bed, right?
right.
Yeah. Too soft. It sags in the middle. - Yeah.
you would think they would spring for a decent bed.
but I guess that's kind of the point, right?
no matter where you are, no matter what city or town, you're always in the same place, the same shitty room...
here.
you got anything salty, pretzels or nuts or something?
uh, no, I-I don't. Sorry.
my partner was found dead tonight.
Oh, Jesus.
I am... so sorry.
he was a good guy...
not like me.
he was never married. Maybe that was it.
what?
he had no secrets, you know?
you can't be married and not have secrets...
can you, Phil?
no, you can't.
what happened?
he was stabbed.
who did it?
bad guys.
we're gonna find them.
you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm-- I'm-- I'm all right.
you can stay here if you want.
in your lumpy bed. No. No, thank you.
I was actually thinking the chair.
that's worser.
why don't I drive you home?
no, I'm good. I'm okay. I'm all right. Thank you.
Thanks.
you know, I mean that sincerely-- thanks.
of course.
sure.
tell me who killed Amador. - Who killed Amador?
Yeah. - Who killed Vlad?
I don't know. Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying, Nina. Jesus.
Vlad was my friend-- my friend!
I'm sorry you lost your partner.
I am. I lost my friend.
this is a really bad day, yes?
Yes, it's a very bad day.
but I-I need to know what happened, Nina.
we had no idea what was going on.
we don't kill FBI agents. You have to believe.
Yes, and-- and that day, I told you
arkady was behind closed doors.
I told you something was going on.
but yesterday-- nothing.
Really? Nothing?
nothing, until somebody called, threatening to kill Vlad if something happened to your partner.
next thing we know, the police call, saying he's been murdered in a mugging.
what are we to think?
I don't know who killed Vlad, Nina.
if I can find out, I'll let you know.
will you?
Yes. We're not monsters, Nina.
but I have to know what happened to Amador.
do you understand that?
Vlad-- he never wanted to be KGB.
he joined to make his uncle happy.
he was a colonel for the Red Army and raised Vlad after his father died.
he wanted to be doctor.
that's all he wanted with his life.
I'm sorry.
I know you just tell me what I want to hear.
that's not true.
listen to me. I know.
but if you can,
I want you to find out what happened to Vlad, how this happened.
will you do that?
I will.
I want to be able to tell his family... something.
come on, guys. Clear bowls. Brush teeth.
do I still have to keep cracking the whip like this?
Henry, did you pack your homework? - I don't know.
well, can you check, please? You guys, come on.
I need a little extra hustle from you two getting out the door.
you're the one who wanted it this way.
excuse me?
stand up.
do you know what my mother would have done if I talked to her like that?
you get to dress how you want, use the phone, watch TV.
you do not get to speak to me like that.
are we clear?
Hello?
dad-- - You and I are not done.
henry: Hi, dad.
what are you doing here? - Thought I'd take you and Henry to school.
Hey, champ. - Hey.
you think you can get ready lickety-split, hmm?
Yeah.
go. Go. Go. - Okay.
Paige: Come on, Henry.
I would appreciate it if you didn't make surprise appearances, especially when we are adjusting to new routines.
sure.
Clark had a talk with Martha last night.
And? - Amador wore a ring.
apparently, it wasn't on his body.
we swept the safe house.
Yeah, and Gregory's team swept the car.
we were all moving pretty fast.
do you have any idea where they ditched it?
I'll signal Gregory and have him get into it.
the feds are gonna push this as far as they know how.
I'll make sure he knows to lay low until we know what's what.
Stan came by the motel last night-- drunk mess.
what did you find out?
that his partner was killed.
I couldn't exactly work him for leads.
you the one who wanted to be his friend, right, because of what a great potential source he could be?
okay.
call next time, all right?
I don't need permission to see my kids. - Fine. Stay.
clean the kitchen while you're at it.
ready? Let's go. - Yeah. - Yeah.
hold that smile, Beeman.
we got a hit on his ring. - How?
J. Edgar's genius-- manpower.
put every available agent in the field, double up on local uniforms, soon enough you get a hit.
where did they find it?
the owner of a salvage yard tried to fence it at a pawn shop in Kingman Park.
salvage yard?
it must be where they dumped the car used to move Amador.
but we got to it before they crushed it.
Doherty and MacMillan are gonna go down there now.
I'm going. I'm going, sir.
Yeah, but I want you to go with them.
I don't want you flying solo on this.
Hello?
the ring you tried to pawn this morning belonged to a federal agent.
look, I don't ask questions, and sometimes people leave things.
it's a fair trade.
well, in this case the federal agent in question was murdered, so I'm gonna ask questions, and you're gonna answer them.
sound okay?
Yeah. - Good.
who delivered the car and when?
it was left here last night.
I didn't see anyone.
they just left it? - Some people do.
they know that I sell the metal
Uh-huh. And the ring was in the trunk?
you got the keys? Hmm?
it was shoved right up there.
so, a car just shows up in the middle of the night, no plates, trunk stripped of carpeting where you find a ring, and your first move is a pawn shop?
vin numbers are filed off.
with the vin numbers filed off?
Doherty. - Ring was shoved up here.
what, you think it fell off?
no. He left it for us.
just give me a minute here, would you?
I want to ask you again.
who dropped off this car?
look, like I already told you
you listen to me, you piece of shit.
you may think you know what I am or what I will and won't do in this situation, but you have no idea.
now, I don't believe someone who just murdered a federal agent would dump their car in some random salvage yard.
so, I want you to tell me everything you know about this.
do you understand?
there's some black guys. They're drug dealers, I think.
they dump cars with me sometimes.
they came by late last night.
I don't know names. I swear to God.
see, that wasn't so bad, was it?
you and I are gonna go look at some mug books together.
Lloyd, have another?
Hey. - How bad is it?
we don't know.
the guy may have left his ring behind in the trunk.
damn.
Yeah.
we'll let you know what we know.
you just keep safe and out of sight till this thing goes away.
you okay?
not really.
philip is, uh, staying in a hotel.
the kids aren't so good.
shit. Elizabeth.
you told me so, huh?
why are you telling me this?
I don't know.
who else can I tell, you know?
Yeah.
no, I can't. I'm [Scoffs] a mess right now.
you'll be okay.
we all will be, you included.
this thing is gonna blow over.
we're just trying to get ahead of it.
and if it doesn't blow over?
let's not cross that bridge unless we have to.
in the meantime, you just stay out of sight and check your signals.
I'll be waiting.
I swear I'm not trying to make any trouble.
but they always wore hats and jewelry like they wear.
these guys all look the
don't even say that.
son of a bitch.
I think we got him.
who? - I-I-I don't know.
the guy who killed Chris, the-- the Russians, the whole damn thing, maybe.
you want to sit down? - The guy from the salvage yard who hocked the ring, and he does business with some riffraff from the projects.
they're the ones who brought him the car.
he says he's got no names, he can't ID them 'cause they're always wearing hats, but then he pulls a face at one of the mug shots, and here we go.
I've seen him before, in Philly.
okay. That I wasn't expecting.
Chris and I are at the site where we lost Joyce Ramirez.
the wife of the dead Directorate "S" officer?
exactly, and that same guy is there.
I notice him, which I would have forgotten, except an hour later he's at the trucking company - where we're following a lead. - He followed you?
only explanation I can make sense of.
didn't you grab him?
he was a little fast for me.
figures.
now I know him.
shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!
Curtis! Curtis! - Don't shoot!
Aah! Don't shoot!
Curtis! - Don't shoot!
out front! Out front!
get on your knees! On your knees!
hands on your head!
bring him up.
Curtis, right?
should have let me catch you the first time.
I'm upset now.
the FBI picked up a member of Gregory's team.
so we won't be skating our way out of this one.
no.
how long ago did he contact you?
hour and a half.
signal him back.
put him in a safe house.
I'll get the exfiltration plan going as soon as possible.
they'll be watching him.
we'll have to be careful, but nothing we haven't done before.
his team?
money cached, contingency plans.
they all know to disappear or expect heavy jail time for drug dealing.
what about him?
what about him?
stub this out, will you?
will he set off into the night gently?
moscow can be a frightening prospect for someone who hasn't seen the world.
he's devoted to the cause. I think he'll like it there.
do you agree, Philip? - I'm not so sure.
tell him the truth-- nice apartment, regular stipend, but he won't be rich.
language lessons for as long as he needs them.
they'll call him in to lecture the cadets, but he won't have an office at Dzerzhinsky.
it's a hard adjustment, but after the first few years he'll be fine.
I'll tell him.
you need to make sure he's actually planning to come.
his options have narrowed by quite a lot, and one of them is turning on us.
he has always been completely loyal.
he's never really been tested. - He grew up here and turned on his own nation.
that's harder than anything any of us have ever done.
well, now he's facing life in a cage or a thousand volts running through his body.
talk him into Moscow.
if you can't, you take the only other option available...
as sad as we would be to see it go that direction.
you know, I only have one real question for you, Curtis, which is-- do you have any idea what it is that you've been doing?
cause if you do know, then, uh, keep your mouth shut.
that's how bad it is.
but if you don't know, if you've somehow kind of been tricked into this, well... you might want to speak up.
you've been arrested twice-- minor drug raps.
I work in Counterintelligence.
do you know what that is?
I'm not saying anything to you.
I chase spies... KGB.
you ever heard of them?
that's the Russians.
you know what I don't care about?
drugs. I-I couldn't care less.
I may look dumb, but I'm not.
you don't look dumb.
cops got all kinds of tricks.
you know, my partner was killed two nights ago.
I'm way past tricks, Curtis.
his name was Chris Amador.
and he was stabbed.
I don't know what to do.
I... feel...
like revenge, you know?
but who-- who really cares?
I mean, what does that get me?
but these Russians that I'm talking about
I'm pretty sure they're the ones who killed him.
so, I'm not tricking you, Curtis.
if you're working for the Russians and you know it, you wait for your lawyer 'cause you've committed treason.
but, see, I don't think you do know.
you and I don't have much in common.
no shit.
but we're both goddamn Americans, right?
right?
well...
well...
we always knew this day could come.
you said.
the world is a shitty place, Gregory.
that's what I really think.
we agree.
I want to focus on now.
cause, like we always talked about, there are plans put in place to help you, to take care of you.
and right now those plans are being put in motion.
I do not know the details, but I guess we will probably take you cross-country by car
moscow, Elizabeth?
I mean, can you really see me there?
I want to talk to you about it because I can.
there would be an adjustment period
get me to LA, okay?
it's a lot closer. Fresh start in Compton.
I can change my identity, my name.
Gregory, this is bad. The FBI are after you.
maybe I can do a little work on my face, you know?
I mean, if you can stand it.
you guys are the masters of disguise.
I don't think they're gonna go for it.
if you ask them, they'll do anything for you.
Gregory. Gregory, please, let's just talk about this.
let's just get out of here, you and me.
I can't. I got to-- I...
his last known political activity was a protest march on Memphis City Hall with Martin Luther King in march of '68.
america's oppressed minorities were rising up already, so why not get in on the action?
philip and Elizabeth said you'd be expecting me.
means a lot meet you, Gregory.
please, let's-- let's sit.
we have to move quickly,
I understand why you want to go to California instead of Moscow, of course.
I wish with all my heart we could make that happen.
we'd do it for you, Gregory, in an instant.
we'd spend anything, move any mountain.
but it just wouldn't work
new documents, new history, even a new face.
with what's at stake,
I'm afraid it wouldn't be enough to put off the FBI.
you're more scared of them than I am, and I'm the one willing to take the risk.
the problem is, the risk isn't just yours.
it's Philip and Elizabeth's, too.
I would never, ever betray them.
I don't think you would.
but do you know why I'm the best at my job?
I'm a guard dog.
I don't take any chances with the people I protect.
that's why they send me-- an old lady
halfway around the world to do this.
now, you've been brilliant, a hero, and your reward is waiting.
if you have any last thought to run to California, please understand that the FBI will follow you to the ends of the Earth.
we put evidence in your apartment linking you to the murder of the FBI agent who was bleeding in the trunk of the car your people disposed of,
when the trail stops at your doorstep, we won't have to worry about them following it any further and getting to Philip and Elizabeth.
it's your final act of service.
you guys don't mess around, do you?
no. We don't.
I...
I won't take to Moscow.
it takes time, but others have done it.
you'll like it eventually.
I have never...
wanted too much, really.
I just wanted to live for something, and I've done that.
okay.
and to know when I'm done.
now I'm done.
you tell him how lovely Moscow is in the spring?
some people just aren't cut out for a foreign travel.
you think he's negotiating, trying to soften you up for California?
I think he's trying to get away from us.
or he's fooling himself. I don't really know.
but we need to get him to Moscow, Philip.
and if he won't go?
he was Elizabeth's first recruit, her agent.
I've had my differences with her, but if this ends the hard way,
I don't want her to have to do it.
you'll be there?
of course.
so, we know who killed Chris.
Oh, God. Thank God.
Yeah. Don't have him yet.
but you will, right?
Yeah, I think so. I think we will.
good. That's good.
Yeah.
you know...
most agents never actually pull the trigger.
but that hasn't been my destiny.
I know.
well, you don't know everything, Sandra.
I've protected you from things.
I never asked for that. I didn't ask for protection.
well, if you want to have a family, be in a family, that's what you do, right?
did something else happen? Is it
it's just...
the world that we live in is a little darker and a little uglier than I think you know.
okay.
so, sometimes...
what?
we could just get out. We could just leave.
I mean, I don't even care where we go.
we could live in a shack, and I wouldn't care.
you and me and Matthew-- that is all that matters.
we could leave everything else behind.
please.
they got Chinese in Moscow?
see? That's one problem.
your friend Claudia
she stepped between me and that door.
she really think she can stop me if I wanted to walk out?
you'd be surprised.
that's funny.
russian girls. You're all tough, huh?
I guess we had to be.
that's why I fell for you.
cause I'm a tough girl?
cause you're committed...
uncompromising, and stubborn.
you like all that?
don't take him back.
find somebody else.
he's gonna soften you all up.
find somebody that will love you for being so strong.
I'm not going with you, Elizabeth.
there's nowhere else to go.
you know they put the FBI agent's murder on me.
I had nothing to do with that.
it was a smart thing to do.
you know, the FBI-- they're gonna keep going on this thing until they get someone.
so, you're-- you're what?
I'm gonna walk out that door, find some men with guns, put an end to this hunt so you can keep doing the job that you were sent here to do.
Gregory, nobody wants that. I don't want that.
you've been faithful to the cause for years.
we want to reward you.
this is my reward.
you're being stupid.
we have a whole new life for you.
I don't want a new life.
Hey, you don't know how good things can be.
moscow is beautiful.
it's Cosmopolitan, much more so than Washington.
there is art. There-- it's-- there's culture.
you're a travel brochure.
listen, people would be in awe of you, the way you have lived, what you have done.
you know me, okay?
I lived here. I fought here.
they're not gonna let you stay. They can't.
they can't risk that, that you could change your mind, that something could go wrong.
you trust me. I ain't changing my mind.
I trust you.
but you know I can't let you.
it ain't up to you, Elizabeth.
I can't! Gregory, please.
you can.
please.
goodbye, Elizabeth.
look who's here.
he won't come.
he wants to find some cops to shoot him.
he thinks that'll end things for us.
for us?
true to the end.
come on, Gregory.
look, you people owe me this much.
wait outside, Elizabeth.
Gregory, please. - I'm done talking.
Elizabeth, wait outside.
no.
you don't have to do this.
I trust him, Philip.
he'll do what he says.
I think that would be a mistake.
we owe him this. He's right.
and I know him.
that's who he is.
please, Philip.
I'm asking you. Please.

no one has any idea who they are.
you go in a john doe.
if you live, do not go back to boston.
you were trained to surmount any obstacle. go.
you're violating a shitload of soviet laws, and you're looking at 10 years in a siberian labor camp.
you're gonna have to start working for me.
I'm looking for a john doe
would have come in thursday night, knife wound to the stomach.
Oh, I'm sorry, sergeant.
he expired that night.
do you play at all?
racquetball if I can find the time.
we should have a game.
see, the thing about racquetball is it's not about power or speed.
it's about strategy, about making your opponent move too fast, tire out, and then make a mistake.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
it's all right. - you all right?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm sorry. I just -- you know what? I get intense when I play.
it's just work stress.
travel business must be awfully damn stressful this week, huh?
you have no idea.
my serve.
get ready to run.
Oh, sorry. work's calling.
I got to go. We'll pick this up tomorrow.
you know, where I come from, you leave, you lose.
if that's how you want to win.
I'll win any way I can.
amador, what do we got?
surveillance team's already moving.
how long? - window in 10 to 15 minutes.
she look clean so far?
that's the report.
okay. Let's go.
come on, guys. we got 10 minutes.
blue. blue.
I don't have time. they often track our movements.
we have a team watching. you're okay.
you think your team can't make a mistake?
believe me. - no time.
you want information?
I overheard something you will like.
we lost an officer two weeks ago -- same night nikolai timoshev vanished.
good stuff, yes?
I can help you, and one day you will help me.
doesn't work any other way.
exfiltration.
safety. That is what I expect.
one step at a time. we're just starting out here.
you're starting out, but the day you forced me to work for you, my life got very scary.
your life got scary when you decided to steal from your government.
we'll protect you, but you have to make yourself worth protecting.
so, tell me about this officer.
everything you heard.
he died at one of your area hospitals.
he was stabbed.
good.
he wasn't just any operative.
he was directorate "s.
I have value. you will see.
he walked into a hospital with no i. d., no wallet, no keys in his pocket.
fit, healthy.
except for that gaping stab wound in his kidney.
except for that.
we've got this photo at police departments across the nation.
so far, no hits.
what about dmv records? We got no city, no name.
what are we supposed to do? Send his picture out to every dmv in the country?
sounds like a good idea to me.
tell the dmvs that overtime is approved and we expect their people to look at license photos around the clock until they find a match.
what to do about his ex-girlfriend"?

you have a lovely daughter.
thank you.
what?
nothing. Let's go. come on.
let's go. - bye, now.
Thanks. Have a good day.
don't tell me Mr. Kontos doesn't have a room upgrade.
I'm looking at the upgrade certificate right now.
look, I've got something I have to tell you.
it's a signal... but it's from robert.
he's been dead for two weeks.
what, did he place this from beyond the grave?
we've yet to perfect that technology, as far as I know.
he's the only one with that code.
who the hell sent this?
they want a meeting in philadelphia, hugo becker square.
when?
tomorrow.
put gregory on it?
man, watch this. Look. what you gonna do now? huh?
okay. Just give me one minute.
what you got now? - what do you mean, what do I got?
I got this $20 right here.
that's gonna be my 20 bucks.
that's gonna be your $20?
hold on. Hold on. I'm thinking. I'm thinking.
look what the cat dragged in.
look at the cat.
get out of here, man.
all right, man.
excuse me. excuse me, sweetheart.
Hey, watch this guy, all right?
don't let him cheat. all right.
come on, man.
Oh, I'm trying to be good.
doesn't suit you.
let's talk inside.
here.
the dmv in philadelphia.
looking for a needle in a haystack, actually found a needle.
larchwood avenue.
larchwood avenue sounds cozy.
it's one of the shittiest blocks in the state.
you caught the fish, beeman. you get to gut it and cook it.
we'll put a surveillance team together.
don't screw it up.
this is new.
whatcha think?
what's with the two red marshmallows?
you don't know shit about art.
no, I don't.
I missed your face, elizabeth.
I missed yours.
I need your team to cover a meet.
okay. of course.
Yeah.
what's going on? you okay? - yeah. Yeah.
I, um...
I can't do this anymore.
us.
look, um... - just say it.
you mean you're finally leaving him?
no. Uh...
the opposite, actually.
things can change.
no, not that thing.
he's your cover. - he's my husband.
all right, you need my people to put eyes on someone for you, right?
here's a pad. give me the info, and I'll get it done.
a wife? robert didn't have a wife.
Yeah, he also wasn't supposed to be living in philadelphia, but he was, and he did.
Oh, christ.
Philip. gregory said an fbi team was tailing her.
I-I'm sorry.
working with her or watching her?
he said they tailed her all the way into the park, stayed with her until she left.
she didn't seem to know about it.
well, if anyone can tell the difference between a support team and surveillance team, - it's gregory, but I don't understand -- yeah?
do you know where the t. w.a. Vouchers got left?
no. - damn it.
barb can't keep track of anything.
he had a wife without the centre knowing about it?
who the hell is she?
and what did robert tell her?
about himself, about us?
we have to talk to her, even if the fbi is all over her.
Yeah. yeah. I'll talk to gregory.
we've been tracking our directorate "s" operative's wife.
this is joyce ramirez.
moved to new york from puerto rico with her parents when she was six, then to philly five years later.
we pulled school records. she seems real "seems"? she's real or she's not.
get year book photos talk to her eighth-grade science teacher.
the kgb is obviously getting better and better at cover identities.
maybe we just bring her in, really go at her.
what do you want to bring her in for?
well, she does appear to have been married to a deep-cover kgb operative.
we can always bring her in.
I have a feeling where she leads us will be far more interesting than anything she might say.
so, you need this pulled off by when?
friday, latest -- is that possible?
Yeah, it's possible.
sure, it's also possible me and my guys get arrested and I spend the rest of my life in a cold cell in a maximum-security prison.
Yeah.
weed burns my throat.
makes you horny, right?
I need you sober.
you don't have to worry about me, baby.
you need to check yourself.
Meaning? - meaning you're lost.
your marriage ain't real. your husband ain't real.
none of this domesti-shity is real.
I know you.
just get your guys together. I'll see you when you're ready.
the night timoshev disappeared, this man died of a stab wound in the emergency room at arlington methodist.
three days ago, we got confirmation he was a deep-cover kgb operative.
a year ago, he married this woman --joyce ana ramirez.
what is that -- mexican?
she's of puerto rican descent.
they have a baby -- oscar.
what does she know?
that's what we're working on right now, sir.
but I can tell you, and you can tell the attorney general, this is the closest we've come to a live kgb illegal on american soil since we got rudolf abel in '57.
you only paid for two!
give me my change!
Oh, no!
Hey, you! hey, you!
pull around, man. pull around.
we got your message. come with me.
back it up. back it up.
do you have her?
excuse me.
come on! Come on!
here. Come on.
here. Come here.
what's happening?
Where's robert?
is he okay?
Joyce, what did robert tell you?
he -- he -- he said that if he didn't come home in two weeks, to place an ad and to wait at the bench under the el
that a friend would come. - anything else?
only that I could trust you.
what's going on?
where is he? is he dead?
Yes.
was it drugs?
was he dealing drugs?
why did he have me call you?
is it money?
there's money, right?
to take care of us.
we're gonna take care of you, okay?
but we do need to know what he told you about us and about what he did.
robert was quiet.
he didn't say much.
I liked that about him.
he said to give you this.
did you call this number?
no. h-he said not to.- good.
how's she doing?
she's a little freaked out.
thinks he was a drug dealer.
doesn't feel like he told her anything.
I was talking about elizabeth.
do you love her?
what? - do you love her?
do you really love her? It's a simple question.
you know, we met at the sclc meeting.
we was putting together a group to march with Dr. King in chicago. we just clicked.
it wasn't about race or vietnam.
it was about equality.
when she told me who she really was, it was like I already knew.
she was recruiting me for the kgb, america's number-one enemy.
and I was right there with her.
me and her against the world.
we were willing to sacrifice our lives, our families.
you know, whatever it took.
you don't have a family, do you, gregory?
you know, she came to visit me a month before paige was born.
just showed up at my doorstep.
no umbrella, pregnant, wet to the bone, crying.
I've never seen her cry before.
so, the next morning, we're just laying there, and...
she says,"i can't go back, raise this child, live this lie.
of course, you know, she got to go back.
it was something greater than her or you or me.
but now I got to ask you a question.
do you love her?
because if you don't... leave her be.
and if you do... leave her be.
let her have a little piece of something real.
she just walked away, right out from under surveillance.
how big was the team? - six men.
and she just disappeared into thin air?
is she doug henning?
we debriefed the surveillance guys.
they said it happened at a choke point, like she knew.
God damn it.
she slipped away from a full fbi surveillance detail.
sounds like a directorate "s" operative to me.
I got to call upstairs.
look, we all thought continuing surveillance was the best move.
we all agree on that.
you worried about me, amador?
you think I'm out on a limb and someone's gonna saw it off?
no, sir. - that's sweet. really, I'm touched.
but if this woman thinks that slipping one surveillance team gets her home to mother russia, she's as soft as you are.
we have her name and her face.
and we have the resources of the federal bureau of investigation.
she has to be quiet to stay safe.
we can make noise.
thank you.
what's the message say?
it just decoded into another name and phone number.
should we call it?
no. we go to the centre, ask for orders.
the longer we're here with her, the more at risk we are.
what do you suggest we do?
so, I'll say it if no one else will.
we kill her, dump the body, get out of this mess before we're all blown.
we'll take that under advisement.
it's my ass on the line, too.
robert was a friend of mine, and I trusted him.
well, he had a secret wife and a baby in philly, so I'm not entirely sure he trusted you as a friend.
as long as she lives -- he's right.
we have her here. we're in control.
I'm gonna go out and get some air, take a walk.
but if you touch his wife, I'll kill you.
do you understand me?
you've been following me since I stepped outside.
now, I've circled around, and you don't have a support team, so whoever you are, you're on your own, right?
you have 60 seconds to tell me who you are and what you want, or I will snap your neck, and I will move on with my day.
I'm gabriel's replacement.
what happened to gabriel? what happened to gabriel?
the centre felt it was time for a change.
so why the hell are you following me?
Gabriel ran things loose.
I like to take a more personal approach with my operatives.
don't you ever come near my kids again.
and don't you ever put your hands on me again.
so, we take orders from you now?
the orders come from moscow, like always.
just think of me as gabriel, but...prettier.
here we are. seconds to spare.
did robert leave anything with you?
I'm sorry?
robert was on to something, and you were the person he trusted most in our world.
he gave me a name and a number.
but I'm used to operating with a little more information.
so am i.
robert got married last year to a woman in philly.
he didn't tell us about her, and I don't think he told her about us, as far as I know.
as far as you know. - yeah.
that's what I know. that'salli know. all right?
your turn.
the americans are working on a new technology, one that could put our nuclear arsenal at risk.
robert was about to buy intel from an agent.
when he died, we tried to find the contract.
we were looking all over boston, leaving signals everywhere.
nothing.
now it makes sense.
Yeah, he was running the agent out of philly.
don't go getting a secret wife on us.
you see how much it complicates things.
let's call that number and set up a meeting for you, shall we?
the woman, joyce ana ramirez, also uses her married name, mckenzie.
the child abduction occurred yesterday, and law enforcement is now asking the public for help in finding the suspect, who is believed
they're hunting me.
they don't know where you are.
I always assumed he was dealing drugs
the sudden business trips, the cash, the calls on pay phones.
what was I supposed to think?
but now he leaves me with instructions to place a classified ad, you guys show up, the fbi?
Joyce, stop talking.
once... he thought I was out of town.
I came home early to surprise him.
he was listening to this weird-looking radio, writing down numbers on a pad.
he said... He was just doodling.
it didn't look like doodling to me.
he was a spy.
you're all spies.
you're gonna kill me and the baby.
is that why he had me place that ad -- So you could kill us?
no. no. he would have wanted us to protect you.
I promise.
so, the tan van pulls out over here.
Yeah. - and the produce truck cuts our guy off and heads north.
but she's headed south.
right. - that puts her in a perfect blind spot, but instead of coming out the other side, she just, what, disappears?
poof?
so, she's highly trained?
Yeah, or she had lots of help.
well, check this out, stan.
one of the eyewitnesses says the produce truck had green and yellow writing on it.
Gabriel's gone? - that's right.
gone where?
grannie wasn't forthcoming.
grannie?
Yeah. she's kind of old. seemed to fit.
well, I'm coming with you.
no, they're expecting a man -- one, not a couple.
wait. Did you tell her about joyce?
I told her robert had a wife and that we have her.
I just found out she's made us as spies, so that update's still to come.
Philip, wait. Do you want to talk about it?
do I want to talk about it?
do you -- I'm sorry. do you mean gregory?
I mean, that was a brilliant surveillance team you had him put together for us.
his own guys didn't even realize they were working for us.
they thought he was some -- some drug dealer.
that was that was genius cover.
I just didn't realize you were running off on me, also.
you've lied to me for 15 years.
lied?
what does that even mean to us?
I don't lie to you, elizabeth. I never have.
I never have. And you tell the truth to him?
you share your deepest feelings about us with him while you lie to me?
I told him it was over. that's why he told you.
he just -- he was trying to hurt you.
that's all you want to say?
you're unbe-- you know what? Don't stop seeing him.
I'm serious.
don't do me any favors.
we'll just keep going the way we have been.
we'll live together. You can make lunch for the kids.
I'll drive them to school.
see him whenever you need -- whenever you need.
I mean, it's worked up until now. Why change things, right?
Philip, wait. Come on.
hands.
anything else?
knife on my left ankle.
down the hall.
I take it you're the guy I'm supposed to talk to.
could you get out of my blind spot?
you got it?
Yeah. yeah, I have it.
I -- please.
look, I just
I did warn them --twice.
you did.
you want to start a war or do you want to give me what I came for and keep all this cash?
what is this?
I don't know. I just made the deal.
if the feds get their hands on her, it could lead them back to you and your family.
our people will relocate her.
what planet are you thinking?
Cuba. I don't know.
you know what I think?
I think you're making an emotional decision.
I haven't made a decision yet.
you want her to live.
robert was a friend of ours.
he had her contact us.
not you. Us. - He was not your friend.
he was your husband's friend.
and you're starting to feel guilty, and it's starting to cloud your judgment.
screw you.
not anymore, apparently.
how dare you tell him?
was it to hurt him?
to get back at me? what?
I was just trying to do right by you.
I love you.
you want to be married to him?
fine.
but if you're gonna do it, you can't do it on a lie.
they bring in nonunion trucks when they get busy, and they barely keep any records at all.
too bad we don't have the power to arrest people for stupidity.
so, joyce ramirez had someone steal a truck to help her slip our team and then, what, other people to make a diversion?
I mean, how deep can this woman's operation be?
she's been living in philly, what, since she was 11 years old?
and when could the russians have gotten her to train her for something like
stop!
out of the way! out of the way!
move! Move!
shit.
this is his turf, man.
no way we find him.
Yeah.
so, what does some guy in the hood care about a kgb spy?
they have passports, new names.
it's all set. - thank you.
Yeah. let's go.
you must be joyce, and this must be oscar.
he's so sweet.
thank you for bringing her to us.
Yes. Thank you.
he'll thrive there.
white beaches, everyone speaks spanish.
cuba's so close, we could arrange for your family to visit, if you like, in time.
he's the only family that matters now.
careful.
the case.
general zhukov wanted me to let you know he's thinking of you.
anything you'd like me to pass on to him?
just that you saw us.
I saw you.
kids will be up in an hour.
no point in going to bed.
you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was 17 when I joined the kgb.
never had a boyfriend.
they put me with you.
we didn't know each other.
when we got here, I was 22 years old.
I was living in a strange house in a strange country with a strange man.
and I met gregory, and he was...passionate about the cause.
he was passionate about everything.
he was passionate about me.
I recruited him, and he didn't even want anything.
he just believed, like I did.
he was the first person I felt I could really talk to, and I need that.
and... it just...
it just happened.
it never really... happened that way for us, did it?
no.
and I'm -- I'm so sorry.
I wish that it had.
but I feel like it's happening now.
where are you off to? - Nowhere.
be home for dinner.
Larrick is a monster.
he is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of my countrymen.
the operation and Larrick are bigger than your wish for revenge.
we're taking the scientist.
please don't send me back, please.
I'll put you on the ARPANet.
this you don't have in the Soviet Union.
the ARPANet ... the scientist mentioned that. What is it?
it has to do with computers.
what can you give me in exchange for Nina's safety?
what is it you want?
the FBI surveillance logs that pertain to me.
there's ... there's still one thing that's bothering me.
I mean, I'm so proud of the way we got through the past couple weeks.
and everything is great.
but, um...
well...
I really like everyone at work.
they're good people.
I don't feel right about helping your office with them anymore.
I know it's how we met.
and I know it's gonna happen with or without me.
but now that we're together...
I don't think I should be involved.
and I feel terrible that Agent Gaad got layered because of me.
well...
that wasn't because of you.
well, whatever he did, your office knows about it because of those tapes.
Martha, we've been over this a million times.
okay, other people have important jobs and wives.
doesn't always have to be a choice, Clark.
see how they changed the front?
what are the seats like? - I don't know.
why aren't you in the driver's seat?
too many speeding tickets. - I'll bet.
rich Perkins, Chevrolet.
Phil Jennings ... just looking.
where you boys from? - Uh, here, Falls Church.
well, it's a great area to zip around in this.
is this really gonna pace the indianapolis 500?
hand on the Bible.
we're not inthe Indianapolis 500.
and that is the beauty of the Z-28.
Chevy wants you to have the same experience As the professional.
why shouldn't you feel All that speed and power and freedom?
road & Track says it's gonna be car of the year.
and it will.
but as your dad knows, We can talk specs till you're blue in the face,
but when you get down to it, Buying a car is about feel.
how does it make you feel?
Hello, Anton.
I'm Vasili
believe it or not...
...I was brought back from America under very similar circumstances.
but mine were worse.
I didn't have a head full of knowledge our country needed.
mother Russia isn't easy.
she has to defend herself.
but she's good in the end.
look at me...instead of a bullet in the head, I'm in charge of this facility now.
I know you want to be with your family in America . I'm sorry.
but your people have survived thousands of years in far worse situations...
...there's something about you.
a way you always keep hope alive.
this contains all the communications of your colleagues in America...
...that you weren't allowes to see when you were working there.
eat something...
and take a look.
what's this?
it's the camaro Z-28.
dad just bought it. Isn't it awesome?
A-mazing!
Well...At least it's not a plane.
when passing through the boundary of the plane waves...
...the Fresnel integral undergoes a finite discontinuity...
what is this? I askes you to write a report, not a Ph. D.
I nees to explain this to my superior officers so they understand it.
the Americans developed submarines you can't hear.
now they're developing planes you can't see.
it's their Stealth Progra,
it's meant to launch nuclear weapons.
the scientist we repatriated...
does he know how to build these planes?
look at my hand.
when i turn it like this...
you barely see it at all.
that's what Anton Baklanov knows how to do...
...engineer the angles of a plane.
...so that radar has only this to bounce off of.
but the radar still hits that.
exactly. The Americans know how to keep the planes in the air...
...and how to disguise this.
that's the report Iwant to send to Moscow.
Oh, come on, guys. Martha's not so bad.
I don't know, sir.
look, my first boss said I should hire an ugly old lady so I'd have to be ten scotches deep before I'd touch her.
he'd do an ugly old lady with ten scotches.
an ugly old lady? Ew.
maybe ten scotches and a bag over her head.
all right, men, Martha's a good girl.
leave her alone.
so, that's what they actually said, but
I'm not sure it's enough to get her back on Clark's side, so...this is how I fixed it.
Oh, come on, guys. Martha's ugly.
I'd have to be ten scotches deep before I'd touch her.
EW. Ten scotches and a bag over her head.
so, what do you think?
I'm gonna play it for her tomorrow morning.
that'll work.
what?
what's wrong?
is it the car?
I just...
I-I want you to be happy.
come on, Elizabeth.
don't you enjoy any of this?
sometimes?
this house, your clothes, All those beautiful shoes.
it...it doesn't make you bad at what you do.
it just makes you a human being.
don't you ever like it?
that's not why I'm here.
but don't you ever like it?
we have to live this way...
for our job, for our cover.
five miles from here, there are people who are living ... - Do you like it?
you know how I grew up.
it's nicer here, yes.
it's easier. It's not better.
don't worry.
it's not deadly.
um, I just wanted to remind you about tomorrow.
what?
my E. S.T. Graduation tomorrow night.
right. - We talked about it.
I-I know.
okay, well, I'll be home late.
no problem. I'll take care of dinner.
great.
Hello?
it's me ... forgot my keys.
Oh, my gosh, Clark. What are you doing here?
I just found out I have to fly to Atlanta tonight, and I feel terrible because it's one of our nights, so I came right over 'cause I thought maybe we could have breakfast together?
you are sweet. I've got coffee on.
do you want toast?
actually, you know, uh, The meatloaf for tonight is ready.
I'll heat it up with eggs.
actually, um, there is, uh, something I do need to talk to you about, Martha.
Ooh, ooh, I cut myself!
Oh, honey. Ooh, hold this, hold this.
do you have a ... do you have a band-aid? - Uh, right in there.
uh, hold it under the water.
Clark, I'm sorry that I was hassling you the other night.
I know that your work is stressful...
...and that you're doing your best.
making all this extra effort ...
I really appreciate it.
so, what did you want to tell me?
well, you ... just...You...
you do everything around here, And I would like to start to pitch in...
by picking up groceries.
Oh, Clark.
you know, my friends and I used to play this in Gorky Park.
had to wait in line for hours just for one game.
let me be perfectly clear.
if I do this for you and then somehow your people find out about her...
I will hold you responsible for that.
do you understand?
you're doing a dangerous thing with her.
I won't make promises I can't keep.
let me put it a different way.
you're doing a dangerous thing.
if you think you can get what you want from me and then hurt her or her family,
I will probably figure that out.
and then you'll feel a whole lot different.
it's hard to think in these circles.
to trust each other when, really, we can't.
we've fallen into something together.
okay, I pushed us into that, but I have no interest in anyone getting hurt.
not you, me, her, some grandmother of hers.
why would I?
do you have it?
we're not in anything together.
however you want to look at it.
I didn't ask for this. Notice we are at my house.
okay.
if your partner's out there with a rifle, He doesn't have to worry.
we're always careful.
apparently, your comrade doesn't think I'm as important to the cause as you do.
she was gonna torture me and then kill me.
what did you do to her?
I didn't kill her. That's what I did to her.
I need to be done with you people.
my freedom for her life. That's my offer.
that's not out of the question.
but I'm gonna need a few things from you first.
you understand I mean done...Forever.
I did it.
you gave him the reports?
I told you. I won't let anything happen to you.
you think this is the end of it?
it buys us time. - For what?
for him to turn me in later or...You?
and he doesn't get more when he asks again?
we're destroying ourselves.
it gets worse and worse, whatever we do.
everything we do.
there's no end.
we'll figure it out. - How?
tell me how. - I'll find a way.
we'll get out of this. We will get out.
if someone at the FBI finds out What you have done to protect me...
you will go to prison. - They won't find out.
what?
what is it?
that you would do this...for me.
I'll get you into the Martial Eagle camp.
I'll report from Nicaragua while I'm down there.
then I'm done. - Right.
for good. - Yes.
there's a password for the camp, a hand signal, as well.
what are they? - I don't know.
well, then you and I have a problem.
they haven't been released yet.
when I get them, you'll have them.
but if you break your word...
so help me, I'll kill every Soviet ambassador in the Western hemisphere before I'm done.
we won't break our word. You get us the signals.
you send us the reports from Nicaragua.
you will never see us again.
shut up, Lucia!
stop! - My family!
No!
kill him! Kill him!
do you want to get into the camp or not?
it's either her or me.
she's not gonna stop.
you choose.
I'll get you the signals before I leave for Nicaragua.
get that body out of my house.
so, I'm going after Oleg Burov, Head of S & T at the Rezidentura.
they got the scientist Baklanov.
they must want whatever project he's working on.
I'm getting close, but no matter what I do,
I cannot get the D. O.D. code-word clearance To even look into it.
did Halliwell try to work it?
Yeah, his position is if D. O.D. wants to get screwed by the KGB,
that's their prerogative.
well, my current position is, I don't know what the hell else to do.
maybe we kill Burov.
is that a joke?
well, that would depend on your sense of humor, sir.
look, D.O. D.'s not gonna budge.
what do you think they'll say? - I have no idea.
but as far as I can see, that's your only chance.
what's that mean? - It's not a word, Dougie.
Yeah, well, it should be. - I-I agree.
it should be. It should be a word.
shoot it! Shoot it!
the helicopters or the men?
Both！
oleg lgorevich and Nina Sergeevna.
I have come to congratulate you. I just reand the Beeman report.
starting to turn a high-level counterintelligence agent is a great accomplishmant.
thank you , sir. - Thank you.
I expect even greater accomplishments to come.
Nina Sergeevna, there is something else I nees to discuss.
the family of...Oleg's family...
...coule be very helpful to you.
or very hurtful.
be careful.
what was that about?
you're not involved in all my operations.
I'd like to be.
you want to go dancing tonight?
pier 9? The wildest disco in town?
are you kidding? We can't be seen together.
I invited some friends from the diplomatic corps.
we'll be ten foreign diplomats on the town.
there's nothing to worry about cover-wise.
it's too risky.
and we can dance if we stay in , too.
I went to a lot of trouble.
Ther're all coming.
I can't dis-invite them.
you can do whatever you want.
so can you.
I'm so sorry. I ...
Hey, Bob. - Hey, Christy.
Philip. What's up?
well, it seems Henry broke into their house.
what? - To play a video game.
I didn't call the police. - He didn't take anything.
what ... what do you mean broke in?
I guess he knew where our key was, let himself in.
that's crazy. -We know he's a good kid.
I-I can't believe this.
I am so sorry. - Kids.
thank you for, um, dealing with it so generously.
this will never happen again.
we ...we will talk to him.
we know, we know. We just wanted to let you know.
okay.
come on, honey. - Good night.
good night.
good night, Christy.
unbelievable.
Hey, hey, hey. It's okay, it's okay.
kids ...do stuff. He ... look, he didn't take anything.
Larrick killed Lucia.
we will talk later.
she went after him.
he trained the police that tortured her father.
let's go get him.
we should've done this a long time ago.
philip ... - No, forget about the camp, - forget about Nicaragua. - I was there!
I let him.
what?
she didn't...Understand what it is that we do.
if she ... if she didn't understand what comes first,
then she didn't understand anything!
it was for her goddamn country!
they shouldn't have sent her.
I'd ... I'd ... I'd ... I'd already worked it all out.
Philip, I-I'd worked it all out with him.
okay. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
it's okay. It's okay.
no, it's all about to break. He was the head of MI-5,
and this guy's saying he spied for the Soviets for years.
they're gonna string him up. - He's dead.
the guy who wrote the story might get strung up.
Why?
cause their Official Secrets Act lets them classify almost everything.
I have a file here from the D. O.J.
that's me.
look at this.
people are leaving classified files on top of here, unsecured, for it to take back down to records.
I've reported it twice.
hangar in Virginia.
two companies are competing to make invisible planes.
invisible planes?
to radar, yes.
this is extremely important.
isn't everything?
Yes, but...
what?
something terrible happened.
a...a submarine...
just say it.
a submarine went down ... the Belomorsk.
we lost 160 men ... a...
a catastrophic propeller malfunction of some kind.
it spun out, ripped through the hull. This was...
this was based on the plans we stole.
I stole.
we have a source in the American Navy
who now says the Americans planted false plans at hundreds of places across the country.
they knew we'd go after them.
we picked up one of the bad plans.
they ... they put out plans...
for us to take that would sink a submarine?
chairman Andropov is furious.
everyone is...beside themselves.
the Centre feels Martial Eagle comes at a perfect time.
we can expose U. S.Forces secretly training Contra commanders on American soil,
show the world American hypocrisy, their bloodiness, their willingness to topple democratic governments, and make sure those Contra field commanders die.
What'd you do ... sell one of the kids?
Yeah.
nice. - Thanks.
you okay?
Oh, y-yeah, yeah. I'm ... I'm ...tired.
busy, huh? - Yeah, yeah.
business is booming.
well, glad to hear someone's is.
work's not good?
it's too boring.
you'd have to buy me a lot of beers, and I still wouldn't talk.
I'll take the beers, though.
well, then, let's find a night.
definitely. Say hi to Elizabeth.
God damn it!
the Soviet Union outspends us on defense by 50%, an amount equal to 15% of their Gross National Product.
during the campaign, I was asked any number of times,
every time, I said,"restore our defenses," And every time, I was applauded.
Larrick sent the password and the hand signal.
good. Now we can kill him.
he's on a plane to Nicaragua.
so, let me be very clear.
we'll get him when he comes back.
we will press for further cuts in federal spending.
what did Kate want?
we will protect the tax reductions...
t-the propeller plans that we stole were fake.
...necessary for our national security.
what?
the Americans planted them.
we sank our own submarine.
160 boys.
I have no intentionof leading the Republican party Into next fall's election...
...on a platform of higher taxes and cut-rate defense.
look at him.
he'll do anything. He doesn't care.
..."we're the party that refused to cut spending.
kids, nuns, journalists ...
he...he doesn't care.
...and held a fire sale on national security.
let's give them all the running room they want.
I'm signing it now and sending it over.
you'll have it in 15 minutes tops. - Yes, sir.
Mary, courier this to the West Wing.
you are the first FBI agent who's ever asked to see me, Beeman.
we have layers of management to keep this from happening.
I know that, sir.
they tried to manage me. - But?
I believe the KGB has kidnapped a scientist to work on some kind of project of theirs.
I need the code-word clearance to look into it.
I know all about it, Agent Beeman.
I did, in fact, discuss it with your supervisor, Agent Halliwell.
the D. O.D. handles their own security for their top-secret military projects.
are they good at it? I have no idea.
probably not, given all the shit the Soviets have stolen Going back to the atom bomb, but until the President puts the pentagon under the control of the Justice Department,
I can't do anything about it.
can't you get me the code-word clearance to get me into the project?
no.
can't the President?
you develop instincts, sir.
with all due respect, I can feel this about to happen.
I can feel it happening now.
the head of the Rezidentura's Science and Technology department is deeply involved in this.
I can stop him.
but the goddamn bureaucracy is killing us.
I am the goddamn bureaucracy.
that's why I'm here...sir.
laundry's only once a week.
without Larrick, it's gonna be tough.
well, it looks like the best way onto the camp...is septic.
it's good for the dogs. Throws off the scent, the disinfectant.
damn.
over there.
sit.
I said sit!
we're gonna take the gag off now.
if you scream or make any trouble, we will kill you.
if you answer our questions and tell us what we need to know, You will be fine.
do you understand?
nod if you understand.
it's gonna be okay, Lewis.
all you have to do is answer some quick, easy questions, and then we'll let you go.
nothing bad will happen. Do you understand?
it is really important that you nod so that we know you understand.
okay.
okay.
which truck do you drive?
which truck do you drive, Lewis?
Num...Number nine.
where are the keys?
inside the truck.
where inside the truck? - Dashboard.
and when you go to the camp tomorrow at Jefferson National Forest,
does the guard there ask you any unusual questions?
Lewis, it is okay.
we're almost done, and then you can go home, I promise.
just look at me. You can do it.
Lewis, just look at me. There you go.
anything unusual that you and a guard discuss?
when you get back in, when you drive onto the camp, what...
it's okay, Lewis.
Lewis, it is okay.
when you drive onto the camp, where, uh, where do you park?
to the right, the ... the kitchen, the dumpster.
great. Great.
just one last question.
who's your replacement if you can't go in?
it's okay. Lewis, it is okay.
you can tell me because nothing will happen to him.
nothing will happen to you, I promise,
but we can't finish until you answer.
P-please, Lewis, for both your sakes, what's his name?
t... - You can do it.
I know you can do it.
is that him? Is that his name?
Lewis, we have the names of everyone you work with.
is that him? Is it Tom Braidic?
nod or shake your head.
good.
one last question.
has Tom ever been to the camp?
I never missed a day.
I bet. I bet. Good, great.
you did a great job.
we can tie him up and gag him.
what if he gets loose? - He won't.
what if a hiker comes by and they call the police when we're in the camp?
no one hikes around here. - What if?
Yeah, what if an old lady sees him or some school kids?
a soldier, yes. This guy?
we have a rope and a blanket in the car.
we can pick him up when we're done.
all right, Henry.
y-you don't have to tell me.
I-I know what you're gonna say.
it's not like I haven't been thinking about it nonstop. I have.
makes me sick.
I feel like I'm gonna throw up, but...
I-I didn't take anything.
I wouldn't do that, and I didn't hurt anybody.
I know the difference between right and wrong.
you know that, right?
I don't know, Henry. - But I do! I-I do!
it just seemed like no one would even know!
and they weren't there.
you guys weren't here.
once I did it, it seemed so easy to keep doing it.
I-I know it was wrong, but...
I'm not gonna do it again. I-I feel horrible.
but...but they think I'm some kind of criminal, which I'm not!
I hate that they think that, and I ...hate them!
and I hate that you think it. It's not true! I'm not!
I'm a good person, I swear!
you know that! You know that!
I'm good. I-I am!
I'm a ... I'm a good person!
I swear I'm good!
I'm a good person.
I...I-I swear I'm good.
I'm not gonna do it again.
I swear.
I'm good, I'm good.
this season on the "Celebrity Apprentice..."
I've issued a challenge to 14 of the world's most successful celebrities to prove that they have what it takes to make it big in my world.
1, 2, 3... Hydra!
14 celebrities, 14 egos...
and more drama than even they can handle.
gone are their agents.
gone are their assistants.
if you want me to bring money, get me a phone.
this time the battle is to raise money for their favorite charities.
last week, the task was to create an ad for the Pedigree pet adoption drive.
that's beautiful. Perfect.
TV producer and project manager Nely Galn took the lead for Empresario.
that's more important than the music.
music we could do at 6: 00.
but Olympic gold medalist Nadia Comaneci was slowing things down.
on Hydra...
30 seconds is like nothing.
project manager Gene Simmons was so confident in his own ideas...
the war room is the battlefield.
he chose to skip a meeting with the client.
rob was not happy.
I stand by our product.
and in the end, Hydra's commercial proved Gene right...
pedigree felt Hydra did the better ad.
handing the women their second devastating defeat.
I have to take full responsibility.
but not everyone agreed.
Jennie, who would you fire?
maybe Nadia.
and Mr. Trump began to question Nadia's competitive edge.
Nadia, you don't seem to be competitive in this environment.
I love you, but, Nadia, you're fired.
Omarosa: Nely's going.
Piers: Nely's not going, but Nadia's going.
Nadia's lovely, but she's been carved up by you lot, and Jennie plunged the knife in.
Oh, don't say that.
sorry. That's business.
when you were directly asked who you wanted to fry, you, Jennie
you, the golden girl of American sport
turned to one of the greatest athletes in the history of the world, and you said, "I fry nadia."
Jennie: Competing on a soccer field is different than competing in the boardroom.
Nadia was my hero when I was a little girl.
and I would definitely be sad if Nadia's sent home.
I feel terrible. I feel terrible. I feel terrible.
there was no choice here.
there was no choice.
it was like a scene out of Goodfellas.
I find it incredibly difficult.
name somebody, Jennie. "Nadia."
Jennie: Absolutely not.
sniff 'em in. Come on.
my tough little new yorker, sniff 'em in.
Oh, gosh.
you're amazing.
is it sad?
you guys were in there so long.
let's go to our war room. Let's go. We'll go.
the boardroom was brutal, brutal, brutal, traumatic.
there's no other way to describe it.
it's over.
I'm glad you're still here.
I like Nadia, but I like you better.
Yeah, but you know what I feel like?
I feel like we have two down.
we are, like, beaten down.
all we need is one win, and that little house of cards will come tumbling down.
that little house of cards comes tumbling down, and they lose, I'm telling you.
because then I think it'll be a domino effect.
Oh, no. It's going to go.
we can win. We can win.
we can win... tomorrow.
we can.
good morning.
morning.
Vinny, how many bodies do you think are in this river?
Mr. Trump, come on, I ratted on one show.
I'm not ratting on this one.
he probably knows, too.
this is the great Jim Cramer from "Mad Money" on CNBC, a really terrific show.
and Ivanka, we know.
they'll be my eyes and ears on this task.
so, what did you think about the boardroom last night? Nely?
I cried. It was very sad for me.
well, do you think you should have been fired?
you should never think you should be fired.
no, I don't think I should have been fired.
pretty damn close, right?
as project manager, you won $20, 000 for your favorite charity.
what is the charity?
pediatric AIDS. - Come here, Gene.
very good.
gene: We won $20, 000 for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.
1, 2, 3... Hydra!
young children are dying every day.
this is actually gonna do some good for some kids that really need it.
now here's an option for you, Gene.
it's your option, but if you're the man that I think you are, you'll do it.
as you know, Empresario has lost two people, Gene, already.
so far, Jim, it hasn't even been a contest, okay?
I'd like to recommend that you go to Empresario as the project manager.
they really need some leadership, because, so far, I haven't seen it.
can you do it? Do you want to do it?
this is your chance, Gene. You're gonna be with women.
Yes. - Good.
very good.
it's a role I was born for.
every guy wants to be. Today I am.
I am the king of all women.
I must tell you, that's become a very, very interesting team.
and I must tell you, you're the devil.
okay, let's get to the task.
with me are two fantastic executives from a wonderful company, Kodak.
now, Kodak has reinvented itself.
it's gone digital, it's doing a terrific job, - and I think even Jim would say good company. - Yeah.
two thumbs up. - Okay.
two thumbs up.
and nobody takes better pictures than Kodak.
Jeff, what's the task?
you're gonna create a Kodak mobile printing experience.
and our new all-in-one Kodak ink-jet printer.
we want you to create an experience that we might be able to take worldwide.
the winning team will be based on originality, brand messaging, and profit.
tomorrow you'll demonstrate your Kodak mobile printing experience by putting it into action on the sidewalks of new york.
the winning team's project manager will get a nice, big, fat contribution to his charity.
the losing team will meet me in the boardroom, where somebody will be fired. Okay?
go. Good luck.
Omarosa: Let's do this.
glad you're with us, Gene.
gene: Okay, I want to say one thing -- it's a benevolent dictatorship.
I've been told I'm the team leader.
do we all understand that?
Yes.
Omarosa: Gene referred to himself as a benevolent dictator.
the rest of my team didn't react.
I'm the only one sitting there with my mouth wide open, saying, "What the hell does he think he's doing?
gene: Let's just all agree on a mind-set and a way of doing battle.
can I call the executives and make a 10: 00 appointment to go see them? - Today?
from 10: 00 to 12: 30. - Let's -- let's do it.
I suggest all of us don't go down there.
the entire army should not go to meet with an executive.
two people do better talking than six.
gene Simmons doesn't need to sit with other corporate executives and hear the party line.
Kodak is looking outside the box, which actually determines that
I shouldn't go and listen to what's within the box.
I am Mr. Outside the box.
write this down in big letters.
it's a Kodak world.
we all just live in it.
it's almost there. It's a Kodak world we live in...
the idea being as you've just branded planet earth and called it planet Kodak.
that's brilliant.
this task was actually over within 10 minutes.
checkmate in one move.
it's a Kodak world. Welcome.
it's a Kodak world, baby.
stephen: I think Tito as the project manager.
you want to do it? - Yeah.
say hello and then introduce everyone, and then we go from there.
Tito: I was chosen to be project manager.
I worked really hard for the last two projects, and a lot of my teammates saw that.
how you doing?
so, we went to go meet the executives from Kodak.
we made sure that we understood what they were trying to push.
what we're gonna talk to you a little bit today is more about the ink side of the business and our new all-in-one printer.
we're bringing affordable ink to the marketplace.
our competitors for the same amount of ink -- us for the same amount of ink.
when you get people to think about ink, they get it.
really what you're selling is not so much the printer as the astonishing new ink product you have in the deal.
you're very astute about that.
we call it an ink revolution.
we look at it like a fight that we're in. The whole team...
you're in a fight, and this is the knockout punch.
you got it.
affordable premium ink.
Nely Galn.
Hi, Nely. Jeff Hayzlett. Good to see you.
Hey, Jeff. How are you doing?
Nely: When Gene just sent two of us to go to the executives, that's not my style, but I think gene is more concerned with having the time to create a great piece of work.
you can do this many documents on our competitor and this many with Kodak, so it really is a no-brainer.
I didn't even know you guys made a printer, so this is.
see, I think of you only doing photo, so you're right.
I'll tell you a little bit more about why our ink is special.
we have all the ink that you need always loaded in the printer in two separate cartridges.
is our big goal in this airstream to sell that we will do the work for you, or that you should buy the printer and do it at home?
Nely went in there, and she did speak a lot.
I'm sorry. Do you want to ask some questions?
go ahead. I'll fill it in.
the kiosks that you have around the world...
and I couldn't stop her.
I felt somewhere towards the end we had lost the executives.
we're selling printers.
that's what they're selling -- that machine.
the number-one word they kept saying is it's the experience.
the buzzwords are "affordable."
the buzzwords are "bringing printing back at home again."
the buzzwords are - - "they're wrong."
gene: To be quite frank, the excutelves may not understand what Kodak needs.
I am arrogant, and I certainly have the expertise to know what Kodak does need.
it does everything for everyone, because it's a Kodak world, and we just live in it.
I am pretty damn good.
damn it, if I was sitting on the sidelines, I would say,"Gene Simmons, you're a powerful and attractive man."
it's a Kodak world, isn't it?
coming up...
stephen: Big brother Alec came down today.
50% cheaper than any ink in the world.
I'm blown away, actually.
Seriously? - I need to sit down.
and later...
gene: If I was the CEO of Kodak, I would say, "I give up. You're the cream of the crop."
Hey, ivanka. Come on in.
stephen: The task this week was to create a Kodak experience that promoted their new printers.
right now I want to break down the project.
Tito: After the meeting with the executives, we brainstormed to make our product better than anybody else.
what's the one word?
Piers: Stephen, unfortunately, by the time he's had 36 pints of Red Bull, is running around the room, basically in some form of demented
a sort of rhino with a spear in his back.
I know it sounds like madness or something right now or like something
I don't like MPE. - Okay.
I think it's meaningless.
you know what we've got to do?
we've got to knock them out, man.
we want the knockout punch, and with this ink deal, we've got it, because we're half the price of everybody else.
it's about the ink.
you guys are the biggest knockout merchants in the world.
their ink deal is gonna knock out the opposition.
who better than Tito and Lennox?
so, the girls are in trouble.
the boys' team here is crushing the life out of the girls.
Kodak presents the ink revolution that's gonna knock you out.
great.
make this one inch from there.
okay. - Okay?
like this.
stop.
hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
okay, half an inch this way...
Nely: Gene is not a get-your-hands-dirty kind of guy.
what sign are you, Gene?
dollar sign, baby, dollar sign.
he's got this big idea.
hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
what is this?
but he had the girls there doing all the legwork, which is fine.
I mean, somebody has to do it.
you're tickling me.
how am I gonna do it in your ear? - I'm ticklish. All right, wait. Go to this R.
he was like the chairman, and I was like his CEO.
clear, agreed-on leadership -- everything.
it's like when a commando team goes out, one guy's the team captain.
if he says, "jump in the fire," you jump in the fire.
gene Simmons let us do all the work and he'll take all the credit.
but I don't care as long as we get a win.
I can smell it when we kill them.
I smell it.
we'll kill them.
man: Here, hold this, will you?
that would sit right there.
trace: I'm with Lennox and Vinny, and we are at the warehouse trying to get a handle on the interior of the trailer.
Vinny: How many we want of those?
1, 2, 3, right? - Yeah.
three photos.
and then what else, Lennox?
we made sure that the trailer was coming along the way we wanted it to...
that's it.
and then we came back to the war room to see how things were going with the guys who had stayed behind and worked with the graphic-design artist to come up with the signage that we were gonna put on the outside of the trailer.
we got a lot of questions, and I need stuff done really quick.
what's up, Vin?
that's the second one.
that has four different banners underneath the banner headline.
all right, guys, listen up.
I need you guys to pose for my picture asap.
one of the final layers of the promotional concept was to take this image of Lennox and Tito having been knocked out by the Kodak ink -- this and that, kind of a cute concept.
Piers: Hey, shirts off, guys.
come closer.
shirts off.
I don't like the direction this is going in.
when did any boxer in history get knocked out wearing a big shirt?
if you continue and we don't make the deadline...
just take the picture. - I'll blame you.
take the picture. - Just so you know.
Vinny: Stephen Baldwin was tap-dancing on top of the table, taking pictures of two naked boxers.
it's such a knockout, it even knocked out two of the toughest guys in the world.
perfect, guys.
it looked like something for a sex magazine, but I didn't say nothing.
we got it.
Piers: Great stuff, guys. Great show.
Oh, no!
Piers: Oh, no!
quick, clean it.
we need paper towels asap.-- Paper towels asap.
we had a number of laptops.
the one that it hits has every single piece of artwork that we have spent eight hours creating.
this is reality.
well, reality, mate, is that we've lost that.
stephen Baldwin managed to pluck total disaster from the jaws of obvious victory.
Oh, my god!
we have had a ruinous piece of bad luck.
"catastrophe" is how I would describe today.
all you've done is fall off a table, wreck the entire project.
is that what you're gonna tell Mr. Trump?
stephen Baldwin managed to crash down onto the table, flicking a coffee cup onto the laptop, which, of course, was the one that we stored all the artwork on, rendering the laptop a gurgling gobbledygook.
it seems to have thrown the whole team off, really.
it may come back again.
let's see. - I doubt it.
we're getting not even the power.
just calm down.
there's no reason to be running and freaking out.
trace: When that stuff happens, it just raises the tension level for everybody, and it makes everything a little more chaotic sometimes, when what we really need to do is just sit back, have a smoke, and think about things for a minute or two.
we've got to be realistic.
without any artwork at all, we're reduced to doing cheap, nasty stuff that doesn't look very professional, right?
so we've got to think of a plan B.
stephen: Come on, vin.
Piers: So, we all left here at nearly midnight, having had to go with an outside printers to get the stuff printed, which may or may not happen.
Vinny: When do you pick it up?
I got to talk to this kid right now. He's got to do it overnight.
Piers: The clock is ticking.
I think we've got a very tough day ahead of us tomorrow.
it's a Kodak world. Welcome to Kodak all-in-one.
make sure you all know that it's Kodak easyshare.
that's the key. - We shouldn't say the Kodak all-in-one?
it's easyshare.
it's very important.
easyshare all-in-one. - Interesting.
Omarosa: Our task was to create a kodak mobile printing experience.
gene Simmons had no clue about this product.
in fact, he didn't even know the name of the product.
that's very good.
it's hard to sell something you don't know.
gene: It's looking just great.
we just need great-looking girls on the outside.
my role today has been the king of the women.
the ladies will be doing the demos of the product because it's always more seductive that way.
how you doing, sir? Would you like to come take a look?
God has given them beauty.
it would be an insult to god's creation to hide the beauty that god wants everybody to see.
think of it as doing god's work.
come on. Go ahead. Take a picture with our cutouts here, and then we'll show you how easy it is to print out inside.
how are you? - I'm very good.
how's the setup?
well, what do you think?
it's a Kodak world. Welcome.
let's go around this truck once.
gene: When Jim Cramer came, he was shocked to see the professionalism that he saw.
by the way, it works -- "welcome."
"it's a Kodak world" or "it's a Kodak world. Welcome," which goes around and around, and we want to continue to get that message, which is positioning kodak in a proactive way instead of, "we've been around forever."
we assume you know us.
I don't recall Jim Cramer having advice or commentary at all.
it was very much "kudos," "good job," "very professional," "very impressive."
he's right, of course.
you're a powerful and attractive man. - Thank you.
look at that, bro.
perfect. Perfect!
the messaging was great, but the presentation was very sloppy.
Piers: This is amateur hour.
this is too late to say that.
it's not too late to say it. I'm saying it right now -- amateur hour.
we had a big mishap.
all of our artwork was lost due to coffee spilled on the computer.
Piers: What happened to the one that was here about the dreams, the moment?
Oh, we didn't get it 50% of the files were corrupted, so it didn't make it.
that was the one we were missing. It's fine.
brother, all things considered...
Tito: I hope the executives can look past the messes that we have for our presentation and look for the idea that we had to run with, and that was ink.
how you been? - Mr. Cramer.
good to see you. - How are you, sir?
how's business?
well, you know what? I got a stock tip for you, man.
do you really? - Yes, sir.
after I'm done exposing the world to what the Kodak easyshare will do, the stock is through the roof.
all right, show me around.
it's the ink that goes in this new printer.
it's half the price of the other guy -- half the price.
Cramer: I think Hydra's giving me a mixed message.
the ink concept is so right.
Kodak is going to love that.
this just looks like another airstream on this side.
I mean, it could be campers.
but why is my first reaction that they got a dumpster going?
I don't want to buy from a dumpster.
I'm surprised that there isn't a big pile of soda cans and strewn paper in front of the place, 'cause it looks like, hey, this is where I can throw my garbage!
so, they've got the letters on there, as well -- Kodak world.
that's a little different.
Hi, guys. How you doing?
Hey, Gene. Good to see you. Jeff Hayzlett.
gene, nice to see you. Susan.
gene: When the kodak executives came down, again, a big, pleasant surprise.
would you mind following me? - Absolutely.
you're on the outside, and you are suspicious of this, - so let's walk around it and see what people see. - Okay.
it's a Kodak world. Welcome.
the "welcome" felt all-inclusive.
so did "world.
"welcome," "world," "Kodak" -- it's a Kodak world.
gene Simmons has that special something about him that makes people want to buy things from him and do things for him.
can I just make you go around once?
come inside here, just because I say so.
so maybe we'll tap into the magic that is Gene Simmons and pull a victory out.
gene: Oh, look at that!
there's another Kodak moment right there.
Kodak -- the ultimate knockout experience.
trace: You're gonna save 50% using this printer because they have this new kind of ink.
Tito: You know what? It was kind of shaky in the very beginning, but now it's going very well, and I think the biggest thing is not really selling the packages themselves but having people knowing that Kodak has some of the best ink in the world.
Kodak is revolutionizing the ink industry.
Yeah, I'll take one.
thank you very much. Appreciate it.
we have a sale!
I think we really jazzed the neighborhood.
we made some noise.
I think we covered all the bases.
big Al came rolling in, and it was really cool.
it was nice to see him.
my brother's a celebrity.
I think people in the area saw him there, and that kind of lent to our cause and the promotion of the product.
you know anybody that takes digital photos with a camera?
some do and some do not.
okay, how would you like to save those people 50% on their printing?
that sounds exciting to me.
well, there's no one more full of crap than Stephen, you know, so he sounds like a good salesman.
you know the cartridges they buy?
Yeah, I don't, but I can imagine, yeah.
they're very expensive.
I'm blown away, actually.
Seriously? - I need to sit down.
I would have bought a couple of these things either way, but he did make it easy.
he really did put a little something on it.
I'll pay $1, 000 each.
you're a fantastic man.
thank you very much.
we took Alec Baldwin's money at the end as a charity donation, really.
very good to have Alec Baldwin there, because, actually, it showed everyone what a real Baldwin is, because, obviously, choice -- Alec Baldwin, massive TV star, Stephen, Baldwin...
come in, come in, come in.
so, think ink... ink, ink, ink.
you are slam-dunked by one word -- ink.
what are we sending these people out with?
the message that you're about ink at amazing knockout price.
I was giving them one of the hardest sells of all time, and there was a fair smattering of English bull going on.
but even I began to believe my own bull so it must be working.
you take that image, as a company, you have a knockout deal.
stephen: The message was clear, but, obviously, the timing setback with the coffee Chernobyl meltdown.
it was a little sloppy, but we had to do the best we could.
it's gone well. We pulled it out of the bag.
Kodak -- it's a knockout.
so, you really had pros and cons for both teams, but you loved the work of one team.
if you look at the kind of things that they set out...
let me see that.
you know, the guys were sloppy in terms of their presentation.
look at the other team. - Let me see that.
the imagery is great.
I saw the slogan and immediately said,"that's a winner."
Kodak is a fantastic company.
thank you both very much. - Pleasure.
two great brands.
gene, how did you feel leading the women?
exhilarated.
we connected immediately.
is that true, omarosa? Is that true?
not immediately.
it was interesting.
he came in and introduced himself as the benevolent dictator -- was the term he used.
you're all cracking up over here, - so I'm assuming you know what they're talking about. - Nothing new to us.
gene, I heard something that disturbed me a lot that you didn't show up for a meeting with the two executives.
what happened?
my strengths, I believe, are in the overview and the big picture, and I didn't want to divert my mind with a corporate executive who has a point of view that's pretty well defined.
we created a positioning of the Kodak iconic brand, which is, it's a Kodak world. Welcome.
if I was the CEO of Kodak, I would say, "I give up. You're the cream of the crop."
Yes, sir?
I heard your presentation was very, very sloppy.
we were in the midst of shooting, and we spilled the coffee all over the computer.
the time constraints that we were under to pulling something out to what we did.
I think we did a very good job of really getting the point across.
okay. I have a very smart friend on my right.
Jim, what did you observe from all of this?
a lot of what happened today was about trying to reposition a great American brand
less about a kind of a warm-fireplace Kodak and more of a current-technology, world-beating ink Kodak.
and there I felt that when I was in your van, it was clearly a better presentation than these guys.
but when it came to the message, Mr. Trump, of what Kodak is trying to do now, revolutionize itself, it was about value ink, and I saw that everywhere in their presentation.
it was a sloppy presentation, but, in the end, the product spoke for itself.
the fact is, the Kodak executives loved what you did.
hydra, you win.
they thought you were terrific.
you also happened to raise the most money, so, Tito, you're gonna be getting $20, 000 for your favorite charity. Fantastic.
Tito: My charity's St. Jude's Children's Hospital.
it's for cancer research.
being a celebrity is only paper-deep, but being a real person is skin-deep and blood-deep, and that's what it really comes down to, is trying to help out children and make sure they have a future.
so, I congratulate all of you.
go back to the war room.
you can watch what's going to happen, and it's gonna be very interesting.
thank you very much. Thank you.
they missed the whole idea -- the whole idea.
3-0.
not only is it a third win, but I think we crushed them again.
we were scrambling, and we pulled it off.
stephen: Coming off a third win, we're feeling really good.
we're just continuing to be a great team.
Vinny: Okay, come on. Let's listen.
Trump: Gene, what happened?
we couldn't have done a single thing better.
if Kodak were to come in, I would say it in front of you and everybody else, you're a terrific company, I respect your brand, and in this instance, you're wrong.
okay.
Omarosa, what happened?
you know, we did not completely get a big vision from our leader, and the reason is because he never met with the executives.
he really was never clear on what we were supposed to deliver.
do you think it was Gene's fault?
I think it was a combination of Gene's fault and lack of a clear plan.
I think the single biggest criticism that I heard from the executives was they felt that nobody was listening.
when they were saying it's about the ink, that shouldn't be number five.
but there was nobody there to listen, because there were only like two people there and the rest of them.
I mean, you didn't get the benefit of six really good minds.
you didn't have enough people to listen.
if you see the positioning we had visually, that presentation,
I thought, was, well, in a very real way, seductive.
I believe Kodak can be wrong.
so, you're really saying the client is wrong?
I believe that, and I would say it to their face.
I've done it before, and I'll continue to do it.
you've got to have the conviction of your belief to be effective.
I think part of the reason you're so successful is that you have a stick-to-itiveness that you came up with an idea, it really worked, - you promoted yourself in an incredible way. - No, that's not it. Respectfully, that's not it.
it's not about me.
it's about positioning an idea. - But I think in this case, you were asked to do something, you failed, and you're standing behind a concept that didn't work, and I think that's wrong.
I disagree. I believe we succeeded and the client didn't recognize it.
Yeah, but you'll never get credit for that -- not here.
talk your way out of this, big boy.
mate, he's saying Kodak's wrong.
kodak's the biggest success story in america right now.
they've transformed the business, and he's saying, it's all wrong.
gene's out.
Lennox: Gene's out.
Vinny: Gene simmons is getting fired.
Trump: Let me ask you this.
Nely, you were at the meeting with the executives? - I was.
they did not like the fact that you wouldn't listen.
they did not like the fact that you spoke so much and wouldn't listen -- they told me that.
Carol, remember, we sat there and listened for a long time, and then at the end we asked questions?
Carol, could I have a response, please?
cause you don't seem to believe that exactly.
we talked quite a bit.
you talked quite a bit.
well, we - - who talked -- Nely or you?
we went in there as a team.
and if one of us talked more, and we didn't stop each other -- - they took offense at the fact that you talked too much.
and they specifically mentioned Nely. Now, I don't know.
you were there, too. - Okay, but asking questions is talking too much?
well, I don't know. I'm not saying it. I wasn't there.
they gave an entire
however you get there, it's the end product that counts.
I stand by what you saw on that street.
it's a Kodak world. Welcome.
I believe they're wrong.
you know what, Gene? You've been saying that, and you've said it more than once.
the fact is, at some point, there's a winner and there's a loser, and tonight, you're a loser.
the other team was chosen by very talented executives, top people at Kodak.
it's a great company. - We won.
they're doing very well.
we got it spot-on, and Kodak is allowed to do whatever they want with their brand.
how could you get it spot-on? He doesn't even know the name of the product.
ask him the name of the printer.
because I'm in the field - - what is the name of the printer?
the 550. Look, it's the all-in-one...
it's the 5300. - 5300
I don't care. - Well, you were close.
I sell emotion.
Carol. - Sir?
if you were me, who would you fire?
I hate when you do this.
I know, but I have no choice because I like your opinion.
I enjoy looking at you. You're very beautiful.
who would you fire?
well, it would be a toss-up between me or Nely.
you couldn't be more wrong on both counts.
we were in the meeting - - that'S - We were in the meeting. - You know, I love that.
take the sword.
I love that.
she's wrong.
and you shouldn't be saying she's wrong, because she took you out of the equation.
I would hire both of them for my marketing company.
good. Congratulations.
you may get the chance.
Jennie? - Yes?
who would you fire?
come on.
Tito: She can't handle it. She's folding.
she's such a nice person. - I know.
fire the bullet, Jennie.
fire the bullet.
Lennox: Here it comes.
it would have to be Gene.
all right, Marilu. - Yes?
if you were me, who would you fire?
well, because the rocket was set in the wrong direction from the beginning, due to the fact that we weren't allowed to go to that meeting,
I think it would have to be Gene.
Nely, if you were me, who would you fire?
I would fire Jennie.
you would fire Jennie? Where the hell did jennie come from?
what the hell?
where did Jennie come -- now, what did Jennie do?
you hit us from -- I mean, that was really a blindside.
kind of a fall-guy situation developing, right? Fall guy.
Jennie is a wonderful person, and she will do whatever...
that's before the kill, right? - No, it's not the kill.
no, no, no. It's nothing.
I said that about Nadia the other night.
you're fantastic. You're a champion. By the way, you're fired.
okay, go ahead.
Jennie takes direction very well and does whatever you tell her to do, but I go back to leadership, and sometimes leadership fails.
Yeah, but she wasn't the leader of the task.
how have I ever -- when have I ever been expected or given a leadership role?
you know, Nely, for the last two weeks, in all fairness, you were the one that was best positioned to win, in my opinion, the last two events, based on all of the great things you've done in your career, and you lost both weeks.
two people -- who are they gonna be?
can I bring back one?
you can bring back one.
Omarosa. - No kidding.
Oh, Gene, I don't get it.
I mean, you may not like her, and I agree with that.
I don't know very many people that like her. I like her.
that's not what it's about.
but it is what it's about, Gene.
she's not the reason that you lost, and I think you're doing yourself a tremendous...
I'm almost trying to help you.
I mean, I could see if -- and, Nely, in all due respect....
I could see if you brought back Nely, ' cause the executives didn't like Nely.
he wants to fire Nely, doesn't he?
he's nailing Nely.
Lennox: She goes to advertising meetings all the time.
this time, she dropped the ball.
gene might be staying.
gene: My judgments are not based on whether or not a client agrees with it or not.
you hire the people who you trust, okay, give me a second name, Gene.
and I'm doing this for you, 'cause you're doing yourself a tremendous disservice. Who else?
Trump: I could see if you brought back Nely, 'cause the executives didn't like Nely.
you're doing yourself a tremendous disservice, in my opinion, by bringing back Omarosa.
who else?
miss Finch.
no kidding.
okay, everyone leave, and the three of you will come right back. Thank you.
staggering.
he's just committed suicide.
Donald Trump was gagging to fire Nely.
gene's in trouble.
Ivanka, what do you think?
I don't understand Gene's decision, and it could be his downfall for bringing these people in.
we'll soon find out. Jim?
the idea that he brought these other two people is, frankly, it's insolence to you, Mr. Trump.
just pisses me off being the cop-out for everybody, being the scapegoat.
it pisses me off. - Oh, you're hardly the victim.
Trump: Annette, let 'em come in.
give me your arm.
look at you two.
that's amazing. - Don't get excited.
no, that's an amazing scene.
do you think it was appropriate that he brought you back?
I think it's totally inappropriate.
do you think it was appropriate he brought Jennie back?
in some ways, yes. - Why? Tell me why.
because he didn't utilize her.
you know, Jennie, I'm sure, has great skills, but she has to step up so that people know what she has to offer.
this guy is not gonna notice.
he doesn't notice any women around him that are not doing things to pleasure him, so if she's not doing that, then, you know, he wouldn't recognize her skills.
Jennie, how do you feel about it? Were you surprised that you got brought back?
yes and no.
I think yes, because I haven't stepped up as a leader, but it's been...
but you weren't supposed to be a leader. - Correct.
he's supposed to be the leader. You're not the project manager.
gene, what am I gonna do?
you brought back two people that I practically told you you shouldn't bring back.
what the hell do I do?
you're so independent, and you're so tough.
you're so tough.
I don't think so.
I think I'm a softy.
see, I know the real gene, and you are a softy in some ways, - but in other ways, you're the toughest guy there is. - Well, that's true.
the problem is i'm giving you a road map, and I don't normally do that.
Nely's a leader.
I believe in her. - Doesn't matter.
I have to go with my beliefs.
she gave the executives a headache.
I think in a lot of ways you're sitting here right now saying you don't think you're being listened to.
you were all but asking for nely to be brought in. - No, I know Gene
he'll do the opposite because he's the most independent thinker there is.
he's like this great genius marketer.
he's a friend of mine, but he wants to show me how independent, so if I say, do this, he's gonna do the opposite.
I disagree. - You know I'm a fan of yours. Wait a minute.
I know you disagree. You disagree with everything.
well, I can tell you why. - You always disagree.
you think I'm a pretty smart guy, I hope, right?
actually, about as smart as they come. - Okay.
why did you bring back two people that I can't fire?
I can't fire them.
Omarosa did nothing wrong, and I think you probably agree with that.
Jennie really did nothing wrong.
she didn't deserve to be here.
I have no choice.
you know that.
gene... you're fired.
I respect your decision.
I don't know why you did this.
I had no choice. Thank you. So long.
thank you.
ladies.
may I? Thank you.
Omarosa: We insist.
all the best. - Thank you.
down, jeeves.
he's a tough guy. - Yeah.
and he's a good guy in many respects, but he's a tough guy.
I just can't believe what I just saw.
we had no choice.
God, he wants to fire Nely.
gene: I trusted my gut more than the two executives I met.
I'm more qualified to make those decisions simply because I'm in the people business.
I stand by my conviction and my decisions -- every one of them.
in their present form, the women don't have a popcorn-fart chance of even shining the guys' shoes.
Oh! This is great.
on Kotu, the men were off to a rocky start.
we can get a transvestite -- a guy.
and Tom felt he was being shut out.
horse. Or maybe a motorcycle. He could be on a motorcycle.
wait, wait, just shut up right now. - Okay.
right now, shut up.
I definitely feel a lack of respect for my ideas and what I'm talking about in there.
over on Athena, the women quickly came up with their concept.
and our hero emerges, and she's like...
miss Z. - Love it.
with time running out for the men,
project Manager Scott Hamilton finally came up with their comic-book character.
how about "E," just "E"?
I think it's distracting. Why is her name "E"?
and they present it to the exec.
zappos. com transforms Megan into our hero, EEE!
in the boardroom, Zappos had a favorite...
they loved the women.
...handing Kotu their second loss in a row.
Scott and Tom went head-to-head.
I think you didn't understand what I was doing.
I don't think anybody could understand what you were doing.
it was like, "How about -- no!
let's get back to the --" zzz, zzz, zzz!
Tom, so far I'm just not impressed.
and Tom stepped up to the plate.
I can control the team.
I want to be the next Project Manager.
ultimately, Mr. Trump had heard enough.
the "EEE" was a big mistake, Scott.
Scott, you're fired.
let me ask you a question.
who do you think it's gonna be?
I think it's gonna be Scott. - Really?
Yeah.
Herschel did almost beat up Tom.
like, he added like a new syllable to the word.
he was like, "Right now-a, you shut up."
and I'm like, "Whoa."
but Tom did say he want to be the PM for the next task.
don't you want him to be?
that may be the best thing for him to do.
the reason why, it may make him show leadership.
Yes, yes. Get ready.
Hi, guys. How you doing?
Hi. Okay.
you know, I think Tom he's just one of those creative dudes that's kind of a... that you just got to put up with.
well, I lost money 'cause I thought it was gonna be you.
no.
but he did actually say a lot of stuff that made sense.
"Zapatos" means "shoes" in Spanish.
we're well aware, thank you.
"Zapatos" means "shoes" in Spanish.
amazingly enough, we figured that out.
I think big behavior and loudness and all that,
I think it's funny as hell, but to command respect,
I think it has to be earned first before you can command it.
Hi, Bob.
thank you for coming to see me. - You look gorgeous.
thank you. You look very handsome. - Oh! Thank you.
how's the charity doing?
I'm here playing for the Brent Shapiro Foundation to bring drug and alcohol awareness.
brent Shapiro was a dear friend of mine.
his father is Robert Shapiro, who was a lawyer with my father on the O.J. Simpson case.
I did a challenge, which I was Project Manager of.
I won my challenge, and I have -- Oh, well, congratulations.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
Oh, wow. This is fabulous. - Yes.
and it will go to great use.
brent Shapiro passed away from drug addiction.
I personally have had mistakes.
I've had a DUI very publicly, which, you know, it's been really hard, but it's taught me so much.
and I want to vocalize that and teach people from my mistakes.
thank you so much for doing this. - Yes.
good morning. - ALL: Good morning.
Joan Rivers won't be with us this morning, but she'll be back with us tomorrow.
now, we're standing on the steps of St. Bartholomew's Church, a magnificent cathedral.
one thing it's known for -- weddings.
people love weddings.
I love weddings.
I've actually had a couple of them.
your task today is to sell wedding dresses at a retail shop that will be provided to you.
I'm already feeling like we're getting screwed from the beginning.
women spend their whole liveswaiting for Prince Charming to marry them, and all we do as men is hope we never get there.
you have 125 dresses per team, and they're donated by RK Bridal.
the one that makes the greatest profit will win.
it's very simple.
george Ross is on my left. Ivanka's on my left.
they're going to be my eyes and ears.
Dennis, you know about wedding dresses.
don't I remember?
love your style, baby. - Yes!
Dennis should be very, very good at this task.
I want you now to choose your Project Manager.
go ahead.
Tom, you said you wanted it. - TOM: Yeah.
well, if you remember,
Tom wanted to be Project Manager last time.
what do you think? I'm happy to do it.
I knew I was gonna be the Project Manager.
I don't think anybody else on our team could manage us to a win.
I just don't think anyone else on our team is gonna be The Apprentice this year.
I'll do it. I mean, yeah.
Athena, who's your Project Manager?
this was the perfect task because it sounded like something that would be in my realm, and it sounded like something that would be a lot of fun.
all right, so you have two great Project Managers.
somebody's gonna make a lot of money for their charity.
let's see how you do.
have fun.
coming up...
Where's Dennis?
give me a Vodka and cranberry.
having a little drink here or there
I don't know how that's gonna sell a wedding dress.
I'm having fun now.
I think we should try to keep it real positive today.
who do you think wants to take charge of marketing here?
I think just getting on the phone and trying to get people down to buy.
big money. Clint?
I really want to encourage you to try to call some of your contacts in the country music industry.
target amount?
100000
I intend to carry out the challenge Tom gave me, which was to raise $100, 000.
and if I have to exhaust all of my resources then that's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna hit you up for some money.
that's why I'm calling.
I'm sending an e-mail to update my mother. - Okay.
this week's task is to sell wedding dresses for charity.
so, how much would you be willing to buy the dress for?
I'd like to see, you know, at least four figures in the number you're about to give me and not some janky four figures.
I could probably do a "main evant."
Oh, my God! - What's this mean?
he's gonna buy a $10, 000 wedding dress, you guys!
so 3 grand. Got the 3 grand, okay?
all right. All right.
3 grand right there. Boom.
awesome. Perfect.
that's us right here, guys.
Where's the girls at? There's Kotu right here.
they're right next door. They're right next door.
this is really the part that sucks because there has to be something that we do that's better than what they do.
we had a daunting task because they put us next to each other, but it's not where you're selling, it's what you're selling and how you're selling it.
Oh. This sucks.
it's so cute and big.
I'm really nervous about this task because the guys, I know, are going to try and bring in as much money as possible.
dresses are arriving.
they know what kind of money we can bring in, and they know we're gonna bring it for this task.
thank you, Shaqir. Peace out. All right.
Hey, it's Clint.
okay?
you want to buy a wedding dress?
let's work on this name.
winter Wedding Sale?
wedding Dress Blowout.
bankruptcy Sale.
Yeah.
how about this -- Red Carpet Wedding Dress Sale?
we'll set up a red carpet out there, they come in.
we have one of those boards with all the logos on it.
I like "Red Carpet."
I had already planned on our showroom looking minimal
simple, clean, like an art gallery, you know?
focus today on raising money.
I got another $5K.
Hey, I got $6, 000 coming in, also, and probably more.
Hi, Preston.
Oh, my God. It's so good to see you.
so good to see you.
Oh, thank you so much for coming down and helping us.
I thought it would be a great idea to reach out to my friend Preston Bailey.
Hi. Khloe.
Preston Bailey is one of the best-known wedding planners.
you know, he's like that guy who comes in and says, "Okay, this is what I see," and does it all.
we have 125 wedding dresses to sell.
and you just need to transform it.
we need to transform it. Done.
I have total confidence in Preston, but I am convinced the boys are pulling out all the stops.
two losses to, you know, a bunch of girls running around in stilettos?
a little bit humbling, a little bit humiliating.
we're gonna be down here, and, you know, we have 125 wedding gowns and stuff, you know, that are really marked down.
and I'll tell you the exact we, uh...
that we have is, uh...
Brian, can you help me with my zipper?
absolutely not.
are you serious?
you know, we have been having a little bit more of a relaxed atmosphere today...
and you're doing this because...?
...and I think that'll translate into getting a lot done.
I hope, if anything, I'm at least contributing to that.
nobody coming on the street.
look, there's nobody walking down there.
you're right.
Dennis had an idea to generate hype for our event.
do you want to go with Dennis or keep making calls?
all right. All right, cool, man.
you ready?
how you doing? - Hello.
what's your name, honey? - Jessica.
how you doing, Jessica? Herschel Walker.
my whole purpose of being on the street right now is trying to draw business for this task we're doing.
give me a Vodka and cranberry.
thank you.
doing my thing, being Dennis Rodman, you know.
boom.
what's happening, guys?
got any money?
Hey, honey. Come here.
sit down. - All right.
how you doing? - Good.
we could have some real cool things going on right now -- me and you.
Oh, yeah? - What time you get off?
out of my team, I think that I know women more than anybody.
I'm more like -- you ever see the movie "Ghost"?
he came back as a ghost and got inside Whoopi Goldberg's body.
that's me.
love her style.
when you have someone that all he want to do is go around the neighborhood having a little drink here or there,
I don't know what that's gonna sell a wedding dress.
Oh, yeah, one more drink, honey. - Yeah, what is it?
vodka and cranberry. - Okay.
I'm having fun now. I'm having fun now.
Hello? - Hello? Tim?
on the phone Tim Mcgraw: Yeah? Hey, it's Clint.
what have you got yourself into now?
well, uh, I'm competing in an event for charity.
good to talk to you, man. - How's it going?
text me your number, okay? - Awesome.
Where's -- Who are we missing?
Where's, uh -- Where's Dennis?
Dennis and Herschel.
Oh, okay.
Thanks.
it seems like you're already starting to call people.
Oh, yeah.
we've been doing that pretty much all day.
Clint's been really working on that.
you know, Brian's also been making a lot of calls.
everyone has been.
well, it's still in the early stages of the task.
they seem to all be working together quite harmoniously as a team.
at least those who were actually present, which was not Herschel and Dennis.
I have yet to totally figure out exactly where they are.
it's beautiful in New York.
no matter where it is in New York, honey, everything is beautiful.
the men's team is right next door, and theirs is Kotu.
so don't go to them because I don't want they're gonna be stealing our...
for me, the main thing now is raising money.
we have this great stuff we're doing, but if we don't have anyone come buy them, then...
my personal goal is to make sure that the group raises at least $100, 000.
well, will you come buy a wedding dress, please?
please?
but you could -- you could throw it away.
I need some of your rich friends to come by tomorrow and buy some wedding dresses.
on the phone Joe Francis "girls gone wild": Joe, I know you're getting married soon, so why don't you buy a wedding dress?
it's for charity, right?
how about $5, 000?
okay.
five thousand. You got it.
good luck, guys.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
we love you, Joe.
here he is.
he's drinking already.
I had a good time, bro.
I have got numbers.
you like the ladies, don't you, Dennis?
Oh, I love the ladies. Do you like the ladies, Tom?
I like the ladies, too, yes.
Oh, my God, bro. I love the ladies, too.
the good thing about today is we found out how to get Dennis to talk more and be more interactive.
the bad thing about it is that it's Vodka and cranberry juice that makes him do that.
I'm gonna go and get some models, come here, get some champagne and stuff like that.
okay.
a friend of mine owns a bunch of clubs around the country.
he said, "You need any girls?"
and I said, "Yeah. I need some girls. Yeah."
he said, "I'm gonna send you over a Russian girl."
Hey, uh, uh, guys.
come on. You ready?
Hey, Tom.
Hey, one of the models.
hello. Hello, how are you?
she looks good.
where are you from, Romania?
I was born in Russia -- Moscow.
Oh, I love Russian bitch-- uh, girls. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I think the day went great. Everybody did an amazing job.
very beautiful.
we got like 150 things happening tomorrow morning at 8: 00, and it's just gonna transform instantly.
Dennis wants to get going soon.
okay, I'm right behind you.
all right, see you, Jesse. Thanks, man. Awesome day.
we gonna go get a drink at the hotel?
Oh, you ready?
I'm ready. I'm out. We're out of here.
is this all of us coming in here?
Yes, sir. I think so -- just us four.
what happened to Tom and Dennis?
this morning, Tom and Dennis weren't there.
I need to ring Tom Green's room.
and we said, "Let's go. We have to go to work."
if it's gonna be four of us, fine.
hey... Get the... up.
wake Dennis up and get the [bleep] down here.
he answered the phone?
Yes. He was all, "Hey, what's up?"
not you.
they'd said they were going down to the bar last night.
are you serious?
they had that Russian girl with them.
that who?
that Russian model.
she ain't no Russian model.
stripper?
you start adding things up, and it looks like those guys had a pretty rockin' night.
I'm just gonna throw it out there.
I don't think Tom really is the best Project Manager.
morning.
morning, everybody. Hey. Morning.
Yeah, we're making a lot of money today.
it's very exciting.
this is going to be the biggest disaster in the history of The Apprentice.
and I mean a positive disaster.
I'm so proud of my team, so proud of this woman here.
this woman is -- I am so proud of you!
bringing in money for the team.
that woman there's bringing money.
I can tell by the look on her face.
she's showing up. Oh.
well, if I fall, we now own Trump Plaza.
okay. Very good.
yesterday I went out of town to do a lecture on survival, and I've learned a lot about survival from here, so it was a good lecture.
I'm so glad to be back.
right on time.
when he opened the back and all those flowers started coming out...
it's not fair.
is this all for us? - WOMAN: Yeah.
it's not fair. - Oh, geez.
first of all, the smell hits you.
and so the smell of flowers -- Everybody's happy now.
this is, like, every little girl's dream room.
we're like, "Okay, it's gonna be a good day."
this is so exciting.
I'm happy to bring people in and help get them their dresses.
who's better, do you think, at wrangling, Natalie or Tionne?
Brande's doing great as Project Manager.
she's very cool under pressure.
we're gonna win.
people underestimate Brande.
she's smart, and she's ambitious.
and that's always a deadly combination when you put it with looks.
Kotu 2 housrs until sales begin
morning, everybody.
it's exciting.
it's literally just going to just transform itself in the next hour.
it's just like what else could possibly go wrong?
I don't know where Tom and Dennis were, but they weren't with us.
and then our Project Manager shows up, and he's still kind of a little bit drunk, I think.
I wonder if I can drink Herschel's orange juice. Will that be fine?
I don't think he wants it.
you're the Project Manager.
you know what really is best for a hangover is cola.
Oh, yeah.
why, were you out drinking last night? - No.
I was thinking that's what you were using the orange juice for.
Oh, no, no, no. I'm just having breakfast.
I'm working.
you know, the fact that Tom was late and really frazzled when he did get here, you know, if I put my "I'm Donald Trump" hat on right now,
I'd say that that's cause for termination.
but if Tom is able to do that and keep his team on task, he was able to go out partying and pull it off.
right next block over, that's where all the bridal registries and everything are.
Yeah, yeah.
we should probably go over there.
can you get Dennis down here to do it?
I-I can't get Dennis 'cause I just...
did you call his room?
not called -- I went to his room physically and knocked on the door -- like, banged on the door.
Clint: Thanks. - Man: Thanks.
Bye.
Dennis -- Dennis' guy called, said he's having a lot of trouble with his eyes this morning, and he's not gonna be coming in.
Dennis is the most recognizable person in our whole regime here.
you know, if we don't have him, I think it's detrimental.
and if we do have him, it can be.
but I think it is better when he's there.
we can start selling now, guys.
let's make some money. Let's make some money.
everybody, let the customers in. It's 11: 00!
welcome, welcome. Come in, please.
do you know how amazing it is to walk into a dull, dingy space and have it absolutely transformed?
a wedding that can be pulled together in 2.5 hours at this age is very important.
it's good to get it done before the groom dies.
are you looking for a wedding dress?
Yeah, my wedding's in September, so I want to be, like, really traditional.
here, look at this. Throw it on.
I think we're a little more sensitive to what women want, especially how important their wedding dresses are to them.
look at that. - Melissa: It's gorgeous.
how fabulous is that? Love it. She loves it.
okay, good. Let's do it.
Oh, you're crying.
you're gonna be our first girl that cries.
Oh, my God. You're gonna make me cry.
I love watching brides find a dress.
Hey, how you doing, Herschel?
you doing all right? I'm good.
you know, men are actually merchandisers, but this group of men are not.
the store was not very inviting for somebody buying a wedding gown.
how are you doing today?
I'm doing good. Where's Dennis?
well, Dennis is sick.
there's something wrong with his eyes, so they sent a doctor to his hotel.
Dennis says he's sick.
he's got a problem with his eyes.
I guess so.
evidently, it's serious enough that he didn't want to show up for the team.
hopefully he's okay.
okay, well, we'll see.
very well. Everyone is working very well together.
well, the women's store...
first of all, it's very attractive.
it's a much more inviting place.
I think they made it more of an entertainment experience, whereas the men, it was just trying on a dress.
red Carpet Bridal Sale Today Only!!! 11: 00am to 2: 00pm
do you have any idea how the ladies are doing next door?
a lot of people are excited to go in and see Joan Rivers, but hopefully we can win it with the corporate funding.
that's, you know...
Yeah, I imagine they have some of that, too. - Yep.
hopefully, Herschel's got the $30, 000 he said. - Yeah.
and if I've got the $40, 000 or $45, 000 I've said,
I mean, that puts us -- Oh, my gosh.
I think we are gonna win if you got that.
all Sales Are Final
sizes 14-16
champagne, ladies? Ladies, how are you?
three. Three champagnes.
I think the first thing I thought of this morning was I had to put on my slickest suit.
I had to look the part.
now, whether you need it or not, you look damn good.
Oh, why, thank you. - Damn good.
it's about you.
the other dress, it's about the dress.
saying that somebody looks nice, and then having a man who's a man's man tell you that is a whole different ballgame.
this is the one.
y'all coming to the right
keep walking this way. Keep walking.
y'all were coming to the right. Okay, we'll check out some of your dresses.
check this out first.
how y'all doing?
y'all care to meet the best guys here?
there was one point in the day when there was nobody out front, and the men were out in front grabbing customers.
do you have anybody in there?
uh, I'll tell you, our store is packed, but I'm saying if you want to buy something, you can.
we got too many people in here, but it's okay.
you can come work for us, as well, my dear.
they have more people in there than we have in ours.
we don't have anyone in ours.
I know. Don't tell him that.
it got to be in the middle of the day, and then we had nobody, and the guys had people.
so I'm not sure what's going on in their room, and I don't know how much money Tom's bringing in.
you guys, the guys' store is full of people.
I don't know. I'm a little nervous.
I really am because I really thought we were gonna have a lot more money than this, and we've only got a few hours to go.
so it's a little nerve-racking.
now, make sure you can see the train off to the side there.
we got to have somebody outside.
the boys have a ton of people in their store, and nobody's pulling people over.
the task was to sell as many wedding dresses as possible, and we had no one in the store.
you don't sit down when you got to make your quota.
we're gonna stand out on the street.
right in front of theirs.
don't go to the boys' side! Girls only! Girls only!
the boys suck! I'm telling you.
it's not worth your while. They suck...
come on in here. Come on over here. Don't you guys want champagne and food?
it's at our store. Go with Joan Rivers. No, no, no, no, no. Y'all going too far.
go with Joan Rivers. Go with Joan Rivers!
Hey. You cannot do that.
Hey, that is totally illegal.
why are you guys doing business in front of our store?
cause it's working.
but next door, they...
are you three gonna buy a dress today?
we were looking for a friend.
do you have your credit card here?
I feel a little accosted right now.
excuse me. I made you a promise. Yes.
the checks are here.
the checks are here!!!
we have a check here from Sound Image for $5, 000.
and we have a check here from the fantastic country music artist and good friend Tim McGraw for $5, 000.
tim McGraw, ladies and gentlemen!
Clint Black brought $35, 000 in.
I'm just officially giving you possession of these dresses right now.
you know, I know we raised money.
it's just whether we raised more money than the women.
but I'm happy that we raised money.
all right! - $25, 000.
$25, 000 from...
qvc, and you know what?
this is the perfect dress for some Joan Rivers jewelry.
Yes, it is.
that is so beautiful.
Yes.
my friend Perry Friedman, he actually took the red-eye from Las Vegas.
how much are you paying for a dress -- $10, 000?
$10, 000. Wow!
thank you. Thanks, honey.
I'm really working very, very hard to make sure this team wins, and not just to make sure I'm safe.
thank you. Thank you.
thank you so much.
okay, guys. We have 9 minutes.
9 minutes.
we had brought in so much money.
it was very exciting.
but I still had this worry about the guys because they're gonna pull out all their cards for this one.
Clint Black's checks just showed up, and my checks are still not here.
this is the fourth quarter with about two minutes left.
this is the 2-minute warning.
is there anybody we can call to find the person?
I'm calling a run to, uh, to get the guy here.
he should be here, though.
Yeah. He's got to come quick now.
it's getting a little crazy.
it's getting a little crazy!
come in. Hey, we got some more here.
ladies and gentlemen, let's have a hand for Herschel Walker.
we have a check of -- And we have to purchase for charity today for...
how much we got here? Wait. Let me see.
$16, 000 right here.
$16, 000, ladies and gentlemen.
Yeah, all right.
Herschel Walker, And we got one more.
our hero fundraiser today with Clint Black, our other hero fundraiser today.
we need a victory right now.
to lose three in a row,
I think our morale would just be shattered.
we haven't added it all up yet, but I think we brought in a lot of money.
thank you, everybody.
I think this has been a very successful -- successful day.
we really, really appreciate all the help for charity.
thank you, guys. Thank you.
good karma, good karma. Whoo!
how'd you do, Brande?
well, I think that we did excellent, and I really don't think we could have done any better.
I have an extremely strong team, and we all worked so well together.
who did a poor job?
I don't think anybody did a poor job.
who was your star?
Melissa and Annie.
that's nice.
Tom, how'd your team do?
everybody did a great job.
it really was a great team effort.
I just think Clint and Herschel were heroes.
I would call them heroes, and, uh, yeah, I think we did good.
did you use Dennis' celebrity at all, Tom?
I remember years ago where Dennis wore the wedding dress, and it was like the biggest story.
did you use Dennis' celebrity for your event?
I did in the sense that Dennis raised some money walking around on the streets, getting people excited about coming down.
you know, unfortunately, Dennis had an allergic reaction.
his eye was hurt today, so...
reaction to what?
I'm allergic to cats and certain animals and stuff like that. - To cats?
we went out last night, and we met some dot-com
would they be billionaires or were the millionaires?
they were billionaires. I think they made but they're not billionaires anymore.
Oh, yeah.
it was the -- It was the dot-com billionaires' dogs that gave you the allergic reaction.
wait a minute. Was it cats or dogs?
cats, yeah.
okay, who cares?
what does Dennis' allergic reaction have to do?
you brought that up.
it was just because I wanted to ex
you know, he was -- he was very sick today, so he had -- a doctor came
Yeah, but, Tom, he wasn't there.
Yeah, no -- That's -- That's why.
well, so, I mean, say it like it is. He wasn't there. - Yeah, no.
sorry. If he's got an allergic reaction or not, he wasn't there.
Yeah, today for the task, but he worked hard yesterday raising money, so...
Herschel, why wasn't he there?
today, I wasn't sure why he was not there.
yesterday, Dennis and I hit the street.
we -- We did what Dennis...
I'm not sure what we did, but we...
Dennis, you explain it.
I'm not... I'll say it, you know.
my job was to do one thing yesterday.
it's to be the billboard.
let me go out there and get -- get some drinks.
that's my element. That's what I do best.
so, you and Herschel hit the bars, not the streets?
we -- We hit the streets -- - Wait, wait.
we hit the streets, now.
I was told to go with Dennis.
by who?
uh, my -- my guy. - Oh, your leader.
because one thing...
what do you think of him as a leader, Herschel?
uh, he wouldn't be on my "A" team.
one thing I want to know who was your interior decorator -- Stevie Wonder?
this was supposed to be a happy event.
I didn't see anything in there that was happy.
we thought that if the store looked minimal and that it would look almost more like a clearinghouse.
by the way, I heard the women's store was fantastic.
it was. - Everybody told me.
thanks to Melissa, our store was wonderful.
I heard Melissa also sold a lot of dresses, but you know what?
here's the bad news. They sold a lot of dresses, too.
and I know for a fact they raised a lot of money. - Don't scare me like that.
you're scared? - I'm scared.
you're scared 'cause you're the team leader, and what does that mean?
generally speaking, the team leader gets fired.
I think it's time to find out.
Ivanka, RK Bridal donated the dresses.
how many did the men sell?
the men sold 21 dresses for a grand total of $63, 450.
okay, George, how many did the women sell?
ross: The women sold 22 dresses...for $103, 000.
that's fantastic.
Brande, you're safe, Brande.
you know, the women are really kicking ass.
I mean, every week now.
well, let me just tell you what that all means.
that means that you won $167, 000 for your charity.
Brande, what's your charity?
it's California Police Youth Charities, and it's for at-risk children that live in low-income neighborhoods that don't have money to go to college, and they give out scholarships, and they give out computers.
Oh, they're gonna like you a lot.
they already do, but they're gonna like you a lot.
all right, get out of here. Good. Congratulations.
thank you.
very good job.
men, what's going on with you guys?
Thank...God.
sadly, somebody's going to be fired.
so, fellas, I'm a little embarrassed for you.
this is the third week in a row, and that's a lot of losses.
Yeah, it's embarrassing.
they won easily, too. They won by a lot. Tom: Mm-hmm.
what happened?
I had a really difficult thing to deal with here.
people were really, really arguing over the first two weeks, big arguments, constant bickering.
and I was working at a real deficit, so I said, "Let's try to keep it positive today."
let's not argue, and let's focus on our jobs.
you claim, though, that you were at an automatic disadvantage, which you are, in that you have a deficit in terms of the number of people on your team.
so losing an additional person...
look, I was very disappointed that Dennis didn't show up.
he said it was a medical thing.
when you weren't there? - I had to stay back at the hotel to try to get him out of bed.
go ahead, Brian. Brian: He wasn't even there.
I had to go to Dennis' hotel room... Trump: Brian, what do you say?
he wasn't there.
they called my room. They thought I overslept, and then basically they started talking about how I overslept.
but you're the team leader.
there can't even be a perception that you overslept.
I don't think you're a great team leader.
all right, Herschel, what do you think of Dennis' job?
well, I don't -- I don't do what Dennis do. I don't drink.
do you think Dennis was hung over as opposed to something else?
Yes. Yes.
who was knocking on his door?
well, see, I don't know because we called Tom.
if you have an eye infection and somebody knocks on your door, you open the door. Tom: I was knocking on his door for about half an hour.
that's why I was late getting to the location. Herschel: Well, may I say this, though?
I and Tom, I'm not throwing you under the bus.
when I got there -- And then watch.
no, I asked Tom -- No, I asked Tom if he got Dennis up.
cause Tom was late, and, Tom, you told me.
he said, no, he didn't get Dennis up. Tom: No, I went to Dennis' room
why didn't you get Dennis up? I went to Dennis' room. I banged on the door.
was he in the room?
I don't know. Nobody answered, and
how long did you bang on the door? - About 20 minutes.
were you in the room, Dennis?
Yep. So I -- So I...
so, why didn't you answer the door?
I didn't want to be bothered.
you knew it was him knocking?
it didn't matter. Somebody was knocking.
did you not want to be bothered with, like, to hell with the task, to hell with the team?
Oh, no, no. Not that. No, it's not about that.
I didn't realize that he was in the room not answering the door.
I just thought that he was asleep.
you just found that out. - But you know what?
I didn't answer the door just because I didn't want people to see my eyes like that.
but they can't see your eyes, Dennis, 'cause you're wearing sunglasses.
I'm sorry. You see my eyes?
Yeah, they look good. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
they look good, Dennis. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. - Good-looking eyes.
so, what do we think really happened -- a cat reaction?
they said it was a cat and a dog.
well, one said cat, one said dog.
Yeah, which one was it?
it wasn't any. It was a girl named Kitty.
or some bitch.
or, yeah -- or some bitch.
did you refuse to see a doctor?
I refused to see a doctor when I was playing in the NBA.
same thing, 'cause, you know, I know my condition.
and you don't think it was disrespectful not to just -- not even open the door, just talk to him through the door and say, "Tom, I'm not feeling good"?
you don't do that to Phil Jackson.
you didn't do that with Michael Jordan.
you respected Michael Jordan a lot.
I know that for a fact.
if Phil Jackson's knocking on your door, you open that door.
is that right?
uh, I'll answer that question honestly -- no. - No?
no. Put it like this -- Michael Jordan did the same thing.
he's a piece of work, I'll tell you.
michael Jordan did the same thing, if Michael Jordan knocks on your door, do you open that door?
I do not open the door.
you just say, "Michael, screw you." - No, no, excuse me.
is that a mood thing, Dennis, or is that...
it's not a mood thing. It's just like what I said.
it's like saying, "You know what?
today -- I don't feel good today.
you know what? Can you guys help me out?
that's what a team's all about.
no matter who's out or who's injured, who's not this, this, this, you expect that, when you're sick, somebody's going, "Hey, we got to stop Donald Trump International Enterprise..."
but if you don't communicate that you're sick, it just seems like you're not showing up.
all right, Clint, let me ask you this.
if you were me, who would you fire?
would you fire the Project Manager, or would you fire Dennis -- just out of curiosity?
in this situation with just the two of them? - Yes. Yes.
if I were Donald Trump and this were my company,
I would have made him produce at least three doctors to tell me the same thing.
Dennis goes.
Yeah, maybe -- his attitude
no, for sure. Dennis is gone. - I don't think so.
5 bucks. 5 bucks. Come on.
5 bucks on who?
I'm taking Dennis. She has Tom.
Jesse, what would you do if you were me right now?
I mean, you see what's going on. What would you do?
fire Dennis and Tom.
you'd fire both. - Yep.
Tom because he wasn't a very good leader.
Tom because he didn't get up this morning, either.
I had to call and wake him up, and I had to tell him when I called to wake him up...
that's not true. I was in the room to wake up Dennis.
no, I wasn't late, because everybody had specific tasks that they had to do, and they were all supposed to do them.
it was all taken care of.
they did leave without you, and it seems like nobody believes that you were actually knocking for that period of time.
and I think there's a little bit of a scapegoat thing going on in that it's convenient that Dennis overslept.
I wasn't overslept, guys. You know
so, what was the problem, Dennis?
I did not answer the door.
I cannot say anything. Trump: How can you not say?
somebody's knocking at the door for 25 minutes, and you're not answering, and you have no explanation?
I did not answer the door. That's all.
but how can you be led?
I mean, do you mind not being led, or do you mind being led?
Hey. What do you want me to say?
no, but, Dennis, Dennis.
if you're me, do I fire you or do I fire Tom?
I...
you tell me, Dennis.
do I fire you, or do I fire Tom?
now, look, you were late, you didn't produce much, and you wouldn't listen to anybody, and you certainly wouldn't listen to Tom.
do I fire you, or do I fire Tom?
Dennis, listen.
I'm listening. I'm listening to you. - Do I fire you, or do I fire Tom?
if I want to stay, I say fire Tom.
well, I'd like to say something about Tom.
I was down in the store, and I asked you about Dennis, and you were very, very protective.
you didn't even seem upset that he wasn't there.
I was upset, but I had been told that he...
you know, like I said, we were trying...
I asked you directly. Tom: What's that?
I asked you directly where was Dennis.
you remember that? Tom: Yeah.
all right, and the answer was that Dennis had an infection.
he couldn't show up.
you did not seem the least bit concerned about the fact that he wasn't there.
there was nothing, that I -- that I knocked on a door for 20 minutes.
nothing that he was there, nothing that you were late.
it's just like you protected him like it's okay.
is that true?
no, the thing is, is whenever something negative has happened over the last two weeks, people dwell on it and it turns into a big fight and it wastes time and it goes on and on and on.
so, I'm trying to keep things positive.
what did Dennis produce?
he did bring some money down.
did he bring money?
his agent brought six or -- had several people come and buy dresses.
what did you do, Tom? Did you bring money down?
I didn't, no. I was organizing everybody.
you didn't organize very well. I'll be honest with you.
you had a lousy-looking store. Okay.
you had no control over Dennis.
not that anybody can control Dennis because I'm not sure he can be controlled, but you had no control over Dennis. I took a...
and you didn't bring any money in.
I took a nontraditional approach to...Wait a minute.
you couldn't control him, you brought in no money, and you had a lousy-looking store.
you weren't much of a team leader.
when you say I'm a bad leader, you have to understand you're not a good leader. I'll tell you right now. But you have to understand...
first of all, you could have been fired last week.
you didn't get along with your team.
this week, you're worse, and you're the Project Manager.
but you had a guy that didn't even show up.
but that's also under your leadership.
I think there's a misunderstanding of what happened there. I...I...I...
frankly, do you want to know the truth?
I think Jesse's -- I think I should fire maybe both of them.
Clint, if you were me, who would you fire?
I'd fire both of them.
I think when Tom didn't show up this morning, that showed that he wasn't ready...
who would you fire? - It would be Tom.
who would you fire between the two of them?
who would you fire, Brian? Brian: It would be Tom. Tom, period.
I think Dennis -- You would fire Tom because he was a lousy Project Manager.
and, frankly, you were lousysy last week, Tom.
Tom, you're fired. Go.
you were lousy last week, lousy this week.
we have to do it. Go.
all right. That's fine.
is that -- Is that
that's it. Go. Get out.
is that it? - Good. Go. Out.
all right.
Thanks, guys.
try a little harder, will you, Dennis, please?
I will try. I will try.
Oh, my God. - My God. That was brutal.
I owe you 5 bucks, Brande, somehow, someway.
excuse me, Tom? Wrong elevator.
he just wouldn't lead.
I think that's right.
I think he also showed poor leadership by sleeping in. - Yeah.
we did the right thing.
well, I got to admit, I'm a little surprised.
I didn't think I was gonna get fired.
but that's the way the cards fell on the table.
I thought I had the potential to win this game, but that's cool.
and, uh, I guess I just -- I am a little surprised right now a little surprised.

others are self-made entrepreneurs. They own restaurants, or they're one of the top real estate professionals in the country.
some have only a high school diploma, and a few have left their successful small-town companies...to come to New York City for the very first time.
this is the chance to work for me at a huge salary, and more importantly, learn enough so that maybe they too can become a billionaire someday.
this is going to be the dream job of a lifetime.
who will succeed and who will fail?
and who will be... the apprentice?

Hi. Hi.
how can I help you?
I'm here to see Donald Trump.
okay. And your name? I'm Tammy Lee.
[ Tammy ] Talk about first impressions.
I didn't really feel the need to show any communication whatsoever with people that I don't even know.
they were all just kind of wanting to communicate kind of nonverbally to each other.
[ Troy ] Working for Trump is more than a big deal. It's a huge deal.
trump has certainly given everybody a shortcut to the American dream.
but I'm gonna earn the American dream just like everybody else.
okay. Mr. Trump will see you now. You can go in over there.
welcome to New York. I've always said, " New York City is the real jungle. "
it's tougher in New York than anyplace in the world.
you're gonna find out what I mean.
okay, let's get started.
I want to introduce somebody who's been with me for 25 years
george Ross. He's my executive vice president and senior council.
on this side-- This is Carolyn Kepcher.
she is the chief operating officer of one of my companies.
and Carolyn is a killer.
there are many men buried in her wake.
these two will be my eyes and ears...
and will accompany you during your tasks.
they're gonna help me make a decision...
as to who ultimately is going to be working as the president of one of my companies, and then we'll see how you do.
this isn't a game. This is a 13-week job interview.
out of 215, 000 job applicants, you're the 16 people that I chose to go through 13 weeks of hell...
to determine who's gonna work for me at the end.
now, some of you think that attending a top business school gives you an advantage.
others think that street smarts and hands-on experience are the best way to get ahead.
additionally, women have a tougher time in the workplace, or so they say.
let's find out.
we're gonna be setting up two teams of eight each, and I've decided it's going to be...men against women.
each week, there'll be a business task to accomplish.
now, I may ask you to work as a street vendor...
or something tougher like working with Madison Avenue to create an ad campaign for corporate jets...
or renovating and leasing run-down apartments.
maybe even put on a rock concert.
you will select a project manager who will lead your team in that task.
I will hold the project manager...
at least partially responsible for a team's victory or failure.
if your team loses, you will all meet me right here in the boardroom.
you don't want to be in the boardroom.
cause the losing team is gonna sit in front of me, and somebody is going home.
all of you should be complimented, but the fact is, there's only one going to be chosen.
that one person will be president of one of my companies at a huge salary...
for a period of one year.
now, I want you to go up to the suite, enjoy yourself, and I'll see you tomorrow.
come on. Get outta here.
[ Sam ] When I saw Trump today, it all came together right there.
I want access to Trump. I want to get to know that guy, but I don't want it to be in the boardroom.
back of a limousine, at a bar with his girlfriend.
I don't care where it is. Not in the boardroom.
[ chattering, Laughing ]
my mama's gonna be proud when she sees me here.
I love it! - Well, this is very nice.
Whoo!
time to toast!
to the enemies! [ Laughs ]
I don't know why we're being so friendly with the men. Why are we cavorting with the enemies?
I like this men versus women. This could be fun.
[ Bowie ] The girls, they're smarter than what I guess some of the guys are thinking.
but if you pull one over on me, I'm gonna 10 times ya. I'm gonna do you by 10 times.
my mind works like that. I'll be able to pull something off a lot better than they will.
I'm so glad it's girls against boys. I'm so happy.
you have an MBA and an M. D.
which one did you do first? The M. D.
so you got done with your M.D. and then you said, " I don't really want to do this. "
I'm gonna get an MBA. It's not quite so simple.
in my senior year of medical school, I was like, " What can I do with an M.D. besides treat patients? "
and Wall Street was very receptive to someone like myself.
[ Sam ] David has an MBA and an M.D. which is impressive.
but you know what? I can't relate to David.
then I moved into venture capital. Did deals with biotech companies and medical technology companies.
I'm just thinking of the school. How do you spend so much time in school?
entrepreneurs shouldn't be spending that much time in the classroom.
they should be... sweating and hungry. And when they hear an idea in the class, they wanna go out and do it.
Oh, my gosh!
ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies! Follow me.
ladies, ladies, ladies. Follow me.
ladies, ladies, ladies.
come on, ladies. Let's go!
organization. That's my skill. Organizing and motivating people.
so I just try to bring us all together.
okay, you guys ready? We're ready.
welcome to Trump Tower. I hope your stay is enjoyable.
to start, please enjoy some champagne and caviar.'
cheers to that! Cheers!
it is a taste of the life you could lead--
but don't get used to it. There's much work to be done.
here is your first order of business:
you need to think of a name for your group. From now on, your team will be known as a corporation.
my office will phone you later with further instructions. Donald J. Trump. "
it has to be marketable. He's so big on naming everything.
we have to name our group something strong.
[ Omarosa ] The envelope gave us our first task.
and that task, although it seems really simple, when you've got eight women.
[ laughs ] it became a three-hour ordeal...of picking a name for your corporation.
so, um, we got to it.
our name has to communicate power, unity-- Class.
and shock. - And no idea is stupid.
I think it's good. We can make something real easy like the BMA Corporation.
or something-- Businessmen Associated.
the BBC Billionaires Boys' Club.
BFB Big F-- [ Beeps ] Balls. [ All Laughing ]
I love that. How about Donald's Darlings?
Nah! [ All Responding ]
no. - Let's keep brainstorming.
we're all versatile. I mean, we're all guys who have different backgrounds.
and we've been thrown together. [ Bowie ] I like versatile as a word.
put that in there. I mean, Versacorp. I mean
[ men ] Versacorp. Versacorp.
Versacorp. What is it? V-E-R
S-A. S-A Corp. One word.
[ Troy ] Versacorp. By God, can I say we all got together and made a decision here.
let's put it right here, baby. Right here.
[ Nick ] We did the name for the organization. And they named it Versacorp.
I wasn't a big proponent of that. I didn't think it's flashy. I don't think it represents all of us.
I don't think Trump will particularly love the name.
I mean, Versacorp. It's dumb.
[ Chuckles ] It's corny.
I thought of one other. What?
Hey! I love that! You like it?
[ Ereka ] I just offered up a suggestion for our group, and it was accepted.
when I have something to say, I'll make sure it's put out there.
if it's just an idea and I'm not sure myself, and I wanna see if it's receptive,
I don't care if it goes or flies.
if it's something that I believe in, I'm gonna push for it, and then I'm sure it'll come across that way.
[ phone Ringing ]
Uh-oh. Phone is ringing. You know who that is. That's Donald Trump.
Hello? Hi, this is Rhona in Mr. Trump's office.
he asked me to call you and tell you to meet him tomorrow morning at the New York Stock Exchange.
leaving here at 5: 45 a.m. Ooh, boy!
did they hang up on you?
[ Ereka ] I've never been to the stock exchange. It's overwhelming. It really is.
and immediately, I'm thinking, " What the hell are we gonna be asked to do in there? "
the telephone rang. And they called to tell that we're going to the New York Stock Exchange.
Oh, what time?
[ katrina ] The first task is crucial because it will set the precedent for all the other tasks to come.
I think the women will win because the eight women that are in there are very strong individuals.
and I think men-- these men, although they won't admit it, may feel it's a bit of a disadvantage not to have us on their side.
if it does involve something in a building on Wall Street, it would not be inappropriate to wear a tie.
[ man ] I need a new suit. - Do you need a jacket to go?
on the floor of the exchange, you really should have a jacket.
but there's no way they're putting us on the floor of the exchange.
[ Nick ] I have no idea what the first task is gonna be. Nor do I care.
it's a brilliant idea. I love the idea.
[ Nick ] We are now really working as a team together. And we're out here to win.
game's on. Game's been on for me since, uh, I showed up off the plane.
all right, come on over, everybody.
welcome to the New York Stock Exchange.
this is really and truly the center of the world for big business.
$40 billion is traded each and every day.
and there's no place like this anywhere in the world.
we're bringing you back to basics.
you're gonna go outside, and you're gonna sell lemonade.
we'll start you off with $250 seed money.
and at the end of the day, 7: 30, we're gonna see who made the most money.
the women or the men. It's very simple.
now, the ladies look to me like they're more excited.
[ cheering ]
the men, I-I must tell you, a little bit stiff.
start getting game plans together.
who is your project manager?
your name? - Troy McClain.
what is your team name? - Versacorp.
that's a pretty interesting name. Who's your leader?
Ereka Vetrini. - Okay, Ereka. What's your team name?
very good. - You like that?
that's very good. I'll tell ya. They're looking awfully good, fellas.
I'm a little bit worried about you. - Whoo!
you're gonna be on the killer streets of New York.
go out there. I'll see you at 7: 30. Who's gonna make the most money?
let's see. [ Cheering ]
[ bell Ringing ]
I've always felt location is important, but the people behind the deal are much more important than location.
I'd much rather have a really smart, talented guy...
doing a deal in a not-so-good location...
than an idiot doing a deal in a great location.
because you'll make money every time.
the key to success is location, location, location.
you're assigned to finding the location. You need to know where the location's at.
we have $250. Let's use that. Let's maximize that. Let's use our seed money.
[ Troy ] It was so surreal to me. Trump standing up there on that podium.
and he says, " Boys, girls, we're gonna go back to the basics. "
and I'm thinking we're going back to Basic Sales 101.
I certainly didn't think I was going back to sixth grade selling lemonade.
now we're gonna go get our cups and supplies.
that'll give use the skeleton. You guys'll be the veins.
you've got a location? I think Seaport is set.
seaport is this way. Probably a 10-minute walk.
lead us to Seaport right now. Let's go to the location, gentlemen.
that's our meeting. We'll have a runner.
[ chattering ]
[ Ereka ] I was selected as project manager...
because I actually thought up the name Protege.
it was definitely difficult being a project manager because...
people are throwing responsibility in your court when they don't want to take it.
[ Ereka ] Listen. You guys, listen. We gotta get a table.
we don't need a table. That is the old-fashioned way to sell lemonade. From a little table.
it's image, though. Image. It's the image.
I would rather invest my money in my product.
[ woman ] I am not carrying a table.
here to back home.
that's why we split into two teams and you let us do what we are-- We'll carry the table.
[ Tammy ] We were all sitting in a circle, huddling, yelling at each other.
and I don't think anyone was being effective for the first hour.
I really didn't appreciate being told I was the one in charge, but then being said, this is what we're doing.
I don't want to be in charge. I want us all to have our own thing.
let's not take it personal. I was not targeting you.
[ Omarosa ] We have absolutely no leadership. Ereka is very emotional.
when you're doing business, you gotta stay focused on the task and keep your emotion out of it.
she's totally irrational right now.
I-I love that these people are like, tell them what to do, but then they're like, this is what we're doing!
the bottom line is if we're fighting, we're never gonna get this f--[ Beeps ] done.
[ Kwame ] This is the Seaport where you see all those big ships. That commercial area.
there's gonna be tourists there. It's a beautiful day. That should be our main location.
we chose a location. We thought about supplies. And we were trying to get...
up to speed as quickly in terms of selling lemonade.
you and I will grab the cups. You grab the markers.
right now, we need to get the foundation: cups, lemonade. Look wherever you can look.
[ Troy ] Everybody did fantastic. You know, they were the wind beneath the wings. They did awesome.
found the lemonade.
we got our feet underneath us, and we ran with it.
thank you, ma'am.
[ Troy ] Kwame came up with an absolute creative idea.
we're trying to get your help in trying to set up a successful lemonade stand.
let me ask you for a couple other things. Sure.
[ Troy ] He got a vendor to give stuff to us for no charge.
would you give us free cups if we brought more people in?
why not? We need free cups. You will do that?
we're gonna be here at 1: 30, sellin'.
we got free ice, free cups, a free cart.
this is wonderful! This is fabulous!
Oh, this is a lot of fun.
attaboy, Nick! Yeah, baby!
and that really helped us in terms of saving a lot of our initial cap-ex...
that we could just kinda bank instead of spending it on supplies.
[ women Chattering ]
I just don't know how to do radio. I know how to use it.
will you show us how?
what's the organization? What's the steps
I think that we should have a group of two or three and the rest of you out marketing until the product gets there.
[ woman ] Are you guys fine by yourselves? Yes, certainly.
we're gonna meet you guys at Rockefeller Center.
Bye, girls. Get gas.
[ Kristi ] Amy and I split offbecause we knew we could buy the product quickly.
with a whole group, there's a lot of talking, there's a lot of attitude.
we just wanted to get it done and let them handle the rest of it.
do we know where we're going?
[ Omarosa ] You're the project manager. Lead.
now, we're gonna start selling lemonade in the next 10 minutes.
come get your ice-cold lemonade here.
dollar a glass. Thank you so much. Have a good day.
you got one? Everybody got one?
are you sure this lemonade is really good? Absolutely.
it's a hard-earned dollar that I'm about to spend on this lemonade.
it's tasty.
how you doing today, ma'am?
Troy McClain from Boise, Idaho. How you doin', sir?
Troy McClain. Can I have a talk with you for a second?
Troy's doing a good job. He's keeping people positive, which I think's the most important thing.
[ Bowie Continues ] We have everything we need. I'm confidant till the day's over.
guys, please meet us at 53rd and 9th. Tell me if you copy.
53rd and 9th. Yes. Yes, we'll be right there.
we've got everything, and we'll start making it.
I hope we're heading in the right direction. Where's our girls? Oh, they're so far back.
I was so caught up in the direction of everybody and I made the stupid mistake...
of not looking and seeing which way was east and west and just asking a stranger.
excuse me, where is Rockefeller Center?
[ man ] Rockefeller Center's right here. Right here, straight ahead?
and he's pointing in a direction, and it was the wrong direction.
Oh, my God! What?
why does that say Park Avenue? Is that right?
I can't believe-- That guy was like Ninth is this way.
please tell me if you hear me. We have a little bit of a problem.
right now we have to find our team members that have the product so we can start selling.
we're having a difficult time communicating with them as to where we're supposed to meet and we're supposed to be.
we just screwed up. We're at 50-- 53rd and Park. Where are you?
[ Kristi ] Okay, read on there how many cans.
let's put one gallon in and see what this is like. 'Cause we need to dilute this.
Amy? Amy. I can't hear her.
Omarosa, how the hell
[ Kristi ] We got lemonade. We made lemonade. We didn't answer the phone because...
we're ready to do whatever it takes to sell this thing and make a lot of money.
one dollar a glass? It's the best lemonade you'll ever have.
we're going nowhere! We're going in circles right now.
we're going in the wrong direction. We are a mile off our target.
we can't hear you. Where are you?
[ Omarosa ] Ereka's the first project manager. Little does she know, or is she not thinking, that if we are not successful at this task, she goes up.
just please get in touch with us. We have no idea where you are right now.
and we're really [ Beeps ] concerned.
guys, give us an exact address where you are and what you're doing.
tell us what you're doing. We're at 53rd and Park.
can you get into a cab and head to 53rd and Park? Let me know.
[ voice Over Phone ]
grocery carts. They have two grocery carts. We'll come to you.
all right, guys. We are gonna meet you at 53rd and Ninth.
no, Eighth. No, they're going to Ninth, though.
okay. We're meeting you at 53rd and Ninth.
the beginning was totally a nightmare, logistically.
we couldn't meet and that was just a nightmare.
this is worse than being in the jungle.
guys! Guys! We found them!
[ Ereka ] Now we're all together and the energy's back on high. We're doing a greatjob.
I am so fortunate to have these girls working for me.
sell, sell, sell! Whoo!
lemonade.
lemonade? Lemonade?
lemonade.
[ exhales ]
my feet hurt. [ Whines ] I wanna go home.
right now, what I'm doing is selling lemonade on the streets of New York City.
and my feet hurt. I mean, that's the thing I'm maddest about right now is my feet are killing me.
let's go-- Let's go with three-- three right now. Three's fine.
a couple more. It's hot out on those streets.
[ Kristi ] Tammy stopped for a lunch break.
we haven't had a glass of water all day, and she spends the money for lunch. I'm pissed off!
[ Omarosa ] She's having a latte. Tammy's-- Look at her. She's in the window having food.
I'm gonna keep on selling 'cause we have money to make, but that is absolutely bull-- [ Beeps ].
Tammy is not really focused on being a part of the team.
success in business is focus not only on individual contribution but working as a team as well.
it was a 10-minute break. That's fine. Ten minutes it is.
can we go get water? Lunch. All right.
I convinced her to walk with me to the store...
so that I could have some time to talk with her.
I want to know why you guys are complaining about me. Collectively, you haven't gelled with us.
and I confide in Tammy. I said, " Tammy, " the women are not feeling as though you're making an effort to connect with them.
my strategy for you is to simply reach out to the women, start participating in these activities. "
y-you know, w-we just gotta hit it hard until 7: 30.
I think we are hitting it hard. We are doing everything we can do.
Tammy says, " Okay, okay, I'm gonna try. "
we walk back to the corner where our lemonade stand is
the first thing she announces is, " Do you guys have a problem...
with the fact I went and took a-a-a hour break? "
I'm getting the impression that people are-- people are upset with me. Me?
why would you come and ask her that when I just explained to you-- I'm just saying
I just-- We just walked for 10 minutes, and I explained to you that that was not a big issue.
I'm getting the impression people are not happy with the fact that I spent two dollars on lunch.
how do you build a relationship with somebody who you can't confide in?
so, as of now, I'm done with trying to help bring Tammy into the fold.
lemonade.
[ Troy ] They say the American dream started from selling lemonade.
lemonade for sale.
how about a glass of lemonade?
real tasty.
[ Bowie ] Look at Dave. Dave, slow down, slow down.
[ giggling ] - Oh, no. Yeah.
[ giggling Continues ]
over here! Dave! No.
no. Don't run. Don't do that. Don't run. Don't do that at all.
David-- I mean, he's a brilliant guy, he's got an MBA he's got an M.D.
but he needed a little help moving the product.
one dollar. One dollar. One dollar. One dollar. One dollar. We just said no.
two dollar. Two dollar. Two dollar. Two dollar.
nine dollar. Nine dollar. Nine dollar.
all right . forget it. [ Nick ] Really, tone it-- tone it down.
he is attacking.
[ trump ] You're not gonna believe this.
the men are at that smelly Fulton Fish Market trying to sell lemonade.
it's a terrible location. And there's nobody here.
I've gotta go. Bye.
definitely a slow time at the lemonade stand.
we need to get business pickin'up. Uh, we're dying a slow death out here right now.
that's about the lunch rush that we're gonna get. That-- That-- That's lunch.
it's 12: 30. So, this location just didn't-- didn't cut it.
all right. We need to move. We need to move now.
we made Kwame the location guy. He picked the Seaport.
[ blows Raspberry ] Seaport bad, man.
we're gonna go to new locations, set up and just hustle where we can.
where are people going? We gotta hit the traffic
[ Sam ] Yep. We better get moving right now.
[ woman ] Are you sure? [ Woman #2 ] Yes.
[ woman ] How come you drank so much?
pouring a glass of it here so you guys can get it quickly.
[ man ] It's kinda warm. - We've been working so hard the ice melted.
here. Put it-- You're still really cute.
I wouldn't pay five dollars for a glass of lemonade.
but if it was served by a very pretty girl, you'd be surprised. I might've paid it.
dollar for the lemonade. Four dollars for the girl.
it's for the lemonade, but the bonus is my phone number. What's your name?
Derek. Derek, thank you so much.
when we sold the lemonade, I was surprised that, yeah, I did use sex to sell lemonade.
just trying to make some money on the street.
not the street. That sounded bad. We're just trying to make some money.
is this your corner? [ Laughing ] It's not my corner.
people may think it's selling sex. To be honest with you, my style of selling is just-- it's me being Heidi.
Oh, my God. Hello, little puppy.
it's the same style I use here as I use in corporate America.
hello. [ Barking ]
Holy-- [ Beeps ] Oh, my God!
thank you so much. Okay.
Oh, look at that. Thanks, you guys. High five.
there you go. Now we made $15 off of you guys.
[ chuckling ] Good sell.
I would not pay five dollars for our lemonade, much less 20, but-- but we can sell it. We did it.
all right, guys. Good job. Way to kick ass.
one, two, three-- [ Together] Win!
[ cheering ]
how are you doing? An ice-cold lemonade for a dollar?
that's okay. I'm good. No? All right.
wall Street lemonade. A dollar a lemonade.
it's frozen lemonade. That's all right.
thank you.
you better have gotten five dollars from that lady. She's rich. Nothing. Nothing.
I think I would've had to have sex with her to sell lemonade.
how about a lemonade for a dollar, sir?
[ bill ] The ship was going down. I mean, I knew it.
at that point, we needed to do anything we could.
[ bill ] I'm concerned at this stage of the game.
I'm a little concerned myself. I don't know if this market's a good market.
there's not a lot of people here either. That's the problem.
well, we might've been better off fishin' in our old hole. No, that was horrible.
Yeah, but how much better are we doing right now?
we had to get out of there. We weren't making anything.
we're not making nothing right now.
we're not having success. We gotta think bigger.
women sell products.
they sell products-- not only to men, but to women.
now, you know, we've had a tough day.
I've got a theory-- you can sell this lemonade better than I do.
[ laughing ] So, what I wanna do is-- Take this. Take this.
hold it. Stay right here for one second. Oh, my God.
excuse me, sir. We need you for like 30 seconds.
Jennifer here is selling the best lemonade with a money-back guarantee.
if you don't like it, we'll give you your dollar back. - All right. No, I'm too poor.
I'm unemployed. You-- money-back guarantee-- So is she.
come on. You're making us look bad. - What is the scam?
this is very strange. - Can I tell you something?
I'm about this close to begging. - I'm not going to pay for lemonade. I'm a New Yorker.
[ Kwame ] What Sammy was trying to do. He wants to get hot women to help sell.
I think everyone knows that sex sells, and that's fine.
but we needed him to focus on some things that were a little bit more tangible.
he let the team down, I think, on that regard.
are you doing well? I am, Sam, but you're irking me. I'm gonna tell you the truth.
I'm just giving you honest feedback.
it's-- It's a high-volume pitch. You know, that's why
I've been saying that all day. It's all a numbers game.
you don't need to spend five, 10 minutes with a customer. I know.
you don't. I know. We're doing okay.
the goal of the task is to make as much as we can.
right. Are you doing okay? Yeah.
[ Sam ] I don't think these guys get it. They don't get it.
and they think I'm a nut. We may have to get some guy...to give us a thousand dollars.
I believe if you buy that lemonade for a thousand dollars, that you're going to have a story to tell.
Donald Trump has got people paying top dollar for real estate in Manhattan, in New York, New York, where other people are getting 50% of what he's getting.
Donald Trump is selling lemonade for a thousand dollars a cup.
now, let me see. I sort of lost you guys a little bit.
I'm giving you my word that if you write me a check...
for a thousand dollars for that glass of lemonade, that you are going to experience the American dream.
[ laughing ] Mr. Trump...
that is a killer thing to do.
this guy's going crazy now. I'm not going crazy.
I'm gonna retire in a few years. Otherwise, I would've done it just for the heck of it.
I-I'm sorry. I don't think I can do. Thank you for your time.
I'm deeply frustrated because...
my weaknesses are being shown today.
I-I've not earned the respect of my team.
I-- I think we just gotta-- [ Sam ] We gotta sell 'em.
one dollar at a time. That's all we can do. It was worth a shot.
[ Carolyn ] How long did that take you talking with that man?
it took 20 minutes. [ Bill ] About that, yeah.
but you know what? There was a chance it could've happened.
I believe there was a chance. - But you weren't selling lemonade.
I tried. I tried.
here's what we need, guys. We got the last 60 minutes.
obviously we gotta rally together. Let's go sell. Let's get it all done.
I feel that the team got off to a " slumpy " start, but I'll tell you what, I still believe in my team...
and I think that we're gonna pull ahead and we're gonna finish this out strong.
wait a second there, Troy. Start selling. Right now, start selling.
he just bought me a cup. I sure do appreciate it. Thank you very much.
it's my pleasure. From one country boy to another. Thank you.
we got Italian lemonade, just made. Two dollars a glass.
I really appreciate that. It better be good.
you tell me it's not good.
even though it is nonrefundable. [ Laughs ]
I got seven left on my tray. Keep going.
this is something I've never seen in the Village. All-American lemonade stand.
I gotta do it because you tried so hard.
Yep. Thank you very much. How did we tally up, gentlemen?
[ Troy ] Uh, I don't want to be that arrogant to think I beat the women, but I also want to be that confident to think I beat 'em.
and I don't think that I beat anybody.
I think that we beat 'em.
gentlemen, fantastic job. Good job today, guys.
[ Together] One, two, three, Versacorp.
Goodjob. Fantastic.
okay, folks, I'm really busy today, so we're gonna go quickly.
Carolyn, how did they do? The men.
um, I think they found a location very quickly.
I think they tapped into some local resources and other shops, et cetera.
and they were able to double their money. It's not bad business.
so, they doubled their money. Not bad. Mm-hmm.
not bad. Thank you, sir.
now we find out the other side. George?
it started off as mass confusion. I was a lot taller than I am now, but I ran my legs off.
after a while they did get their act together.
I though that they sold pretty well. And they not only doubled their money, they quadrupled it.
they made, uh, over $ 1,200.
what can I say? The numbers speak for themselves.
men, you only doubled your money.
but the women had a 400% profit.
the women are the winners of the first task. And it wasn't even close.
[ cheering ]
women, great job. As a little treat, you're gonna see the nicest apartment in New York City.
it's my apartment. So you be up there-- 1: 00 at my apartment.
guys, they killed you. They really gave you a good beating.
so you're not gonna be seeing my apartment.
you're gonna be seeing the boardroom where somebody has to get fired.
[ cheering, Applauding ]
I think we sold as much lemonade as we possibly could.
there are a couple of holes in how we did the planning process and being too frenzied in the beginning.
but I think after I learned how well the girls did...
I felt like, " Okay, we could've done a lot better. "
I didn't expect them to outpace us by, you know, $7 00 or whatever.
that's a lot.
[ Nick ] I'm happy for 'em. - Where's the bread at?
I'm sure they did a great job.
[ man ] They obviously did. Obviously.
[ Troy ] Theyjust spanked us, and we'll come back.
so, let 'em-- let 'em reap the rewards right now.
but don't-- don't get us wrong. We would've rather been there. That's the part that sucks.
[ Bowie ] I'm disappointed that we're not going up to Trump's penthouse.
it would've been nice-- and they have nothing to worry about tonight.
they know tomorrow, they'll all be there.
obviously, we need tips from the ladies. That's right.
Yeah.
Oh, my God. [ Chuckling ]
Oh-- This kinda reminds me of my house.
Oh, my God. Yeah. I feel like I'm at home.
wait a minute. Look at this door.
Hi. Welcome to Mr. Trump's home.
Oh, my God. Thank you.
look at that view.
so amazing. Oh, my God.
this is like rich. This is like really, really rich.
look at this. You guys, come here. Oh, my God.
when we went up to Donald's apartment words can't describe how beautiful it was.
everything you saw was breathtaking.
and we got to meet his girlfriend, Melania, who is amazing as well.
Hi. Hi. I'm Melania.
pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you.
Hi. how are you? How are you?
[ chattering ]
Wow. That's great. Of course.
how do you clean a house like this?
well, you have people to clean up. [ Laughing ]
I don't think she's doing it. [ Heidi ] Well, you're very, very lucky.
Oh, thank you. And he's not lucky?
Oh, no. No! - He's very lucky.
Hello, everybody. You don't even know who I am.
see? Hi.
Congratulations. Thank you.
so, look, if you're really successful, you'll all live just like this. We can only wish.
maybe not like this-- - Maybe not.
or maybe even better.
if you're really successful, this is what it is. And it's fun.
I show this apartment to very few people.
presidents, kings.
let me give you a little tour. Oh, yea!
okay? Come on. Okay.
and they walk in, they look around, and they really can't believe what they're seeing.
Theyjust feel it's amazing.
watch over here.
you'll see something-- - Oh, my God.
we got to see a different side of him, a more personable side.
he was having a lot more fun.
[ trump ] Okay. This is the dining room.
[ Tammy ] When's the last time you actually ate dinner here? Uh, a long time ago.
that's a very good question. It's a very good question.
so, this is the beginning. Now you have to put on your competitive hat again, forget about this and go out and work, and see how you can do.
because you want to win. - Thanks for having us.
okay? Enjoy yourselves. Thank you, everybody.
Bye. Bye, everyone.
he gave us some advice.
he said, " Work hard and have fun. "
and I really, truly believe that that's how he lives his life.
[ chattering ] Oh, my gosh. This is so rich.
this is like really rich.
guys, all I'd like to say is, uh, everybody did a greatjob. Fantastic.
girls just did better.
I think one thing is that tonight at 5.00-- whether we do this now or later
we're gonna be posed with a very difficult question.
someone's gonna have to accept, to some degree, responsibility for this.
who's walking out of here today? And why?
[ Bowie ] I'm worried without a doubt about going in tonight.
I have no idea what to expect. I feel like I'm a good debater, but I know Donald Trump can out-debate me anytime...
and will call me and kind of throw me under the bus.
I would go in thinking, you know, thinking as a unit, because that's
[ bill ] But I think we need to know when we leave there, we're gonna be one man short.
I mean-- Yeah.
I don't think there's any denying-- I mean-- Somebody's gonna be in the crosshairs.
[ Troy ] You're starting to look at each other and go. All right. Is there lines being drawn in the sand?
you just don't know.
right now, I'm going to the boardroom-- and I'm the team captain.
I'm the one that was elected to guide this ship to success or failure.
so, I have a certain amount of accountability.
just one thing I ask-- We praise people first, criticize second. Of course. Yeah.
state the positives first, and the negatives second.
it's nothing personal. It's business.
[ laughing ]
in a few minutes I'm gonna get ready to go to the boardroom meeting...
where we sit down with Trump and his, uh, viceroys.
actually, I'm somewhat looking forward to it.
um, I'm confident in my ability at verbal self-defense...
and able to go on the aggressive if need be.
I think multiple people are worried, but the only one with a high degree of anxiety is Sam.
you get your anxiety all up. Settle down. Good luck.
deep breath, in. [ Inhales ] Good luck.
let it out, swami. Let it out. Deep breath. Do it for me. [ Inhales ]
[ exhales ] Man, doesn't that feel good? Settle down, man.
[ Sam ] I'd like to take down some notes on the computer.
I'm personally getting bad energy from-- from David.
if Trump's looking forward to his future president,
I think he may see that David's not the guy, and he may oust him out immediately.
but you don't know. You don't know.
you don't know what gets that guy going...
and what he's evaluating.
it isn't just about selling lemonade, that I know.
good luck. See you, everybody.
good-bye. Good luck. Thank you very much.
Bye, guys. Bye-bye.
see you in a bit. - Take care.
you had a little bit of a rough day.
George, what do you think? - Working for Trump is a very serious business.
whoever's gonna get the job ultimately...
is gonna spend a lot of time with me.
and I don't want to deal with an idiot. What's easier than selling lemonade?
what do you need? Location. Location. Location.
you gotta pick out the spot where the most people are that are your potential customers.
some of the locations were better than others.
we were initially in a great location right next to the Seaport.
I do know that Fulton Street Fish Market is right next to it.
I just thought it would be an easy place to get to, set up quickly...
and be ready for the lunchtime crowd.
setting up at the Fulton Fish Market with the stink of, you know, of the fish market
to me, uh, it's not very tempting.
David, if you were the team leader, do you think the result would have been different?
not in this case because sales is not my forte.
[ george ] Sam? - Yes, I think things would have been different.
you think you would've won? - Part of being a leader, part of being a coach...
is that you put your ideas out there, and you make sure that they're at least tried.
[ trump ] You don't think Troy did a very good job then.
first of all, Troy is a hustler of the ninth degree.
and he displayed some amazing leadership qualities.
I think Troy's weakness yesterday was my weakness.
it's listening skills. - Jason, what about you?
you've been sittin' here very quietly. Got something to say?
I'm just kinda listening to what everybody says, and, uh
unfortunately, at this point, listeners we got plenty.
we need talkers. - I-- I understand that. But I'm not just gonna talk to talk.
everybody here's a good leader. I'm not gonna argue with that. And I'll stick up for everybody on that.
but the problem-- - But they were saying Troy isn't a good leader.
what I-- Well, I didn't finish. I'm saying that
Jason, let mejust say something. When you're trying to be chosen by someone, you don't interrupt them and say, " Let me finish. "
that's number one, you know, in terms of life.
we're talking about life, right, fellas? - Yes. Yes, sir.
so, when I ask you a question, and I'm not finished with the question, you don't say, " Let me finish. "
that's a bad move, you know.
Jason, do you think if you were the leader, the result would have been different?
Yes, I think the result would have been different. - Why, Jason?
Troy was the leader. Really the leader's supposed to listen, take everything in, and then at that point decide what's going on.
not all of a sudden get out of the gate and start delegating.
do you think they would've listened to you? - Yeah, 'cause I would've listened to them.
see, I think that's business school stuff. You have to act, not just listen.
Troy. - It's easy to answer these questions today
monday-morning quarterback. Because you're a Monday-morning quarterback.
that's right. You're right. But, by God, I had the balls to step up, and I kept positive with my team as much as I could.
I told Kwame, this is the location, I back you up.
you made your decision. That's it.
as far as Troy is concerned, he did delegate.
if you pick the right person, you're a hero.
if you pick the wrong person, you're a bum. It's as simple as that.
I also think you have to have the ability to make the decision and make it stick.
and may God have mercy that you made the right one.
[ Carolyn ] Well, I actually do disagree with the two of you.
I think you were very inconsistent in your leadership. You backed up Kwame, but you didn't back up Sam.
[ trump ] So, you're saying he was a selective leader. - I think he was a selective leader.
who do you think, Jason? Who's the worst leader?
I would probably say Sam.
Wow.
[ Kwame ] I would actually say Sam as well. - Sam.
is that because Sam is going over the edge?
I can answer that question. Yes.
he doesn't earn the respect of the team.
Sam, so who do you think is the worst leader?
why is he the worst leader? - I don't know if David believes in himself as a leader.
Oh, really?
Sam, they are killing you. - I want to make something really clear, 'cause I'm getting angry.
by doing what he did, did he go over the edge?
he went over the edge. - Every one of these guys...
think that you're not so hot.
but you have to be careful. - You're making the decision.
you're making the decision. - I'm making the decision. That's true. Absolutely true.
but you have to be careful, Sam.
if I'm your president, Mr. Trump-- I'm gonna stand right here in front of you, and I'm gonna say it in front of everybody here.
I will not break the rules for your organization.
if you tell me I'm coming close, I will stop.
if you have to punch me in the stomach...
and tell me to sit down and shut up, I'll shut up.
and I'll learn, Mr. Trump. I don't want to work for anybody else in this country.
I come and work for you and be your apprentice and follow the rules.
you want to work for the best. I'm learning here
that's a big stretch. - No, it's not a big stretch for me, Mr. Trump, because I learn fast
you don't believe in the genetic pool? Excuse me?
that what you have you have. - I've got genetic pool big time, Mr. Trump, just like you got from your father, Fred Trump, and your mother, Mary Trump.
all right. Well, I hope you're right. I hope you're right.
now listen. Troy, you may be the project manager, but you're not the only one responsible for the failure of this corporation.
I want you to tell me who the two people are...
you feel are equally responsible for your team's loss...
I'm gonna ask Sam to join us in the boardroom.
I also think that David should join us in the boardroom.
okay. I'm gonna ask the five
Jason, Nick, Kwame, Bowie and Bill-- go back up to the suite.
you three-- Troy, Sam and David-- go outside.
we're gonna have a little discussion, and you'll come back momentarily.
thank you, sir.
[ trump ] How do you feel about Troy?
I see him turn on the charm. But I've actually seen him in action.
I think he was somewhat inconsistent.
David, Donald Trump is a forward-thinking guy.
I don't sense that you are necessarily gonna be the guy who's ultimately...
gonna be the president of one of his organizations. Just have to wait and see.
I'll tell you what I didn't like about David.
you asked David, " Did Sam step over the line? "
Sam did not step over that legal line. He did not break the rules.
that's important that you say that, because I sort of thought he did, and you were there, and you don't think he did.
I'm gonna be the president ofThe Trump Organization.
I can't do it today. I can't do it today.
you know what I'm doing right now? I'm like this. I'm like this.
and you know what? Maybe we should all crawl in there, because you know what
I already said, " Denial is a river in Africa. "
I'm not denying anything. Today, I'm crawling.
tomorrow, I'm gonna be like this. Next week, I'm gonna be like this.
and in a couple weeks, I'm gonna stand up there, just like he does, and I'm gonna be promoted to president of his organization.
now you're Homo erectus, okay?
I like Sam. I think he's a risk taker.
you don't think you have to watch him constantly? Yeah.
Yeah. But that's all right. You've been taking risks all your life.
we'll find out if I hung myself. Mm-hmm.
I'm not gonna say any more.
all right. Let me get Robin.
Robin, let 'em come in, please.
okay. You can go in and see Mr. Trump now.
[ trump ] So, Troy, I know why you picked Sam.
I don't know why you picked David. What happened?
I think David is a fantastic logistics person, numbers person.
I think that he is gonna make a great right-hand man.
[ trump ] So you don't think David would make a good leader?
that is correct.
and Sam you picked because he's just sort of uncontrolled.
you wouldn't necessarily trust him with your bank account?
Sam's a maverick. - Would you trust him with your bank account?
absolutely not.
with me, I was born with principles, I was born with values, and more so, I was born with genes.
and you don't think he's got those principles? - Troy, you're--you're gettin' rough here.
for you to say that you would not trust me with your bank account...is saying you think I am dishonest.
maybe it's-- I want you to articulate that to me.
maybe it's lack of discretion, not lack of honesty.
Troy, you've done a lousyjob as the leader.
really. The women kicked you around badly.
and you've done a bad job.
despite that, you did step up, and you do have potential.
so, I'm gonna let you stay.
thank you, sir.
now, Sam, it seemed to be unanimous that
I don't even think it's lack of leadership.
sit down. - Thank you, Mr. Trump.
you gotta be careful, 'cause you're a wild man.
you'll do great, or you'll be a total disaster.
I haven't figured it out yet.
David, on the complete opposite side.
I don't see that you stepped up at all.
you even admitted that you wouldn't have been a good leader.
as you both know, we have an elevator that goes up to the suite, and an elevator that goes down to the street.
one of you will stay, and one of you will be sent home.
and, David, I'm gonna ask you to take the down elevator.
you're fired.
I'm sorry to hear that.
go ahead, fellas.
thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
thank you, Mr. Trump. - Good luck.
[ trump ] With David I'm not seeing anything. I think he's very smart.
I think he's a lovely guy. But I'm not seeing it.
that was very interesting...
and somewhat surprising.
my experience in the suite was okay.
um, it was almost too quick of a time interval...to fully judge it.
I thought Sam's song-and-dance routine was absolutely ludicrous.
Mr. Trump acknowledged that Sam might be a disaster.
I think that's probably the pretty likely outcome.
I take solace in the fact that I have a higher IQ than the other 15 contestants.
which just goes to show you that there's little correlation...between IQ and success in lemonade sales.
after two straight losses, Versacorp was allowed to pick a member from Protege...
to even out the teams.
we're gonna take Amy. - Don't you think you're giving Amy a little too much power?
maybe what you're telling me is I should just give her the job right now.
for their next task, teams had to pick an artist and sell their artwork at a gallery.
against the objections of his team.
I really would like you guys to see Leah's work. - I already made a decision. It's Andre.
meanwhile, Omarosa's lunch plans interfered with Heidi's work plans.
we don't have time to sit down for two hours.
I think you're being really rude, Heidi.
I'm not being-- [ Beeps ] rude. I can't fricking stand you. You whine and complain. Bitch, bitch, bitch.
[ trump ] That night, Protege's choice to pick...
a provocative and sometimes X-rated artist...
proved to be a tough sell.
what it is is everybody wants a virgin outside of the bedroom:
everybody wants a whore inside the bedroom. Ah, yes!
that is what I see.
[ trump ] Nick's decision to stick with his gut instinct paid off, and Versacorp won by more than $ 1 2, 000.
back at the suite, Heidi was distracted by her mother's illness.
are the doctors optimistic?
[ Heidi ] My mom is doing well. She's still in the hospital now.
they're doing tests on Tuesday just to make sure. - All right, love you. Bye.
[ trump ] In the boardroom, the drama between Heidi and Omarosa escalated.
my concern was sitting down in a restaurant could take longer than 25 minutes.
if she explained it that eloquently to me yesterday, we probably wouldn't have a problem.
you didn't let me get a chance to.
but because she likes to drop the " F " bomb every five minutes-- - Oh, my God!
[ trump ] Omarosa's endless confrontations with her teammates finally caught up with her.
I don't like the fact that you two argued over whether or not to have lunch...
when you have a small amount of time, and you are the one that wanted the lunch.
Omarosa, I don't like excuses.
you're fired.
[ trump ] Seven candidates are left.
who will be fired this week?
so you wanna be the next big thing
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
you wanna be a spotlight Ah, you wanna be
they'll put you on the front page Wanna see the bright lights
Ah, you wanna see
that millionaire money, money
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
you wanna have a jet plane Ah, you wanna have
your face on the big screen You wanna have
a big yacht Oh, you wanna have
your very own TV show
wanna have a penthouse Ah, you wanna have
your name on a building Wanna have a spotlight
Ah, you're gonna have
that millionaire money, money
na, na, na, na, na So you wanna be the next big thing
Omarosa plays a very defensive game.
[ Troy ] Kwame, me, Omarosa and Heidi had to go to the boardroom.
Kwame and I have been a team forever. We've never not been a team.
I was so anxious for him to come back.
did he ask you who the weakest link was? Yes.
[ katrina ] I would fire Omarosa. I don't agree...
with the way she conducts business and the way she carries herself.
[ door Opens ]
no. - Is anyone home?
[ screams ] Hi!
[ cheering ]
Yeah! Oh, my God!
[ all Chattering ]
Oh! Omarosa's gone! Yea!
[ Amy ] Congratulations, you guys, for making it back.
it's a relief off my shoulder. - Look how much stronger your team is now...
because there's not conflict You have to deal with.
the team was getting dragged down. I think she was hindering team performance.
I wanted an electric shock button, but I didn't have one.
I don't know if we're stronger without Omarosa. Omarosa was very detail-oriented.
she was one extra brain, one extra body.
but with that came some conflict and some friction.
who knows how it weighs out in the end?
[ siren Wailing ]
[ Heidi ] Today, I was able to visit my mom in the hospital.
Hey, you. It's so good to see you.
my sister met me outside. It was so good to see her.
is she okay? She's fine.
my mom had the operation, and it was successful.
she's doing great. The doctors are so optimistic they got everything out, it hasn't spread.
I just feel so much better seeing her.
however, it does put things into perspective. - Love you.
this game is not the only thing in life that counts.
first and foremost, my family comes above anything.
you have to prioritize what's important.
[ telephone Ringing ]
good morning. Hi, this is Robin from Mr. Trump's office.
he wants you to meet him at 9: 30 across from the plaza Hotel.
there's a stand there with rickshaws. Great. Thank you.
[ bill ] We're geared up. We're ready for anything.
bring it on, baby. I'm ready.
good morning. - [ All ] Good morning.
now, this is gonna be interesting today.
transportation in New York City is a basic disaster.
getting around in the city is tough. It doesn't get any tougher anywhere in the world.
each team is going to manage a fleet of pedicabs.
starting tomorrow, for one eight-hour shift,
you must design and implement a business plan...
to increase revenue for the pedicab company.
the shift ends promptly at 6.00 p. m. no later.
at the end of the day, we'll find out...
who makes the most money by managing the fleet.
it's very simple. The losing team...
will see me in the boardroom.
somebody's getting fired.
have fun. Good luck.
you can prearrange appointments, possibly.
make appointments. Give people free rides today.
[ Heidi ] We elected Troy the project manager last night.
because I was a project manager, then Kwame, and it's just going round and round.
we're just being fair about it. There's no ifs, ands, whys or buts. It's his turn.
we can have two teams, 'cause we have one rickshaw thing.
it would be like us being the celebrity rickshaw.
[ Kwame ] In order to actually win this game, You had to think...
Where's the other angle to get money we can't get from just running rickshaws around the city?
we started to brainstorm on how we would manage our drivers, develop an incentive program, figure out a central location for where we wanted our drivers to go.
[ Troy ] The other thing is, could we sell a prepaid punch card in advance?
would they buy 1 0 rides in advance? That would create a higher profit.
I came up with a creative idea that we're gonna sell prepaid punch cards.
we're gonna buy volume discounts from the owner of the rickshaw company.
then we can go out and sell 'em in advance.
do you know where we could sell those? All these fancy hotels, and Central park.
it's won, you guys. I guarantee you: it's won.
this is the company. The Manhattan Rickshaw Company.
what about getting costumes? [ Bill ] In this task, I am the project manager.
it was either gonna be myself or Amy.
Amy and I decided to flip a coin, and the coin came up with my side.
we could all dress up in different Disney characters, or whatever. It's a schtick.
Ben Affleck, Sharon Stone.
or even have a contest every hour on the hour to see who makes the most.
I think a girl-- to have a girl driving them around Manhattan
that's a catch. There's something to that.
[ Amy ] We could advertise on the back of the rickshaw.
[ bill ] And then Amy said, " Well, let's sell advertising to them. "
it was like a lightbulb went off. We instantly knew that this could be something that we were on to.
Oh, my God. Now we're thinking, guys.
let's call up everyone we've met who has the restaurants and things...
and see if they wanna buy advertisement on the rickshaw.
we could be like NASCARs. You ever see those guys?
they got patches all over their car, their bodies.
if we put this together, it'll be a bloodbath.
[ Troy ] I think that looks great.
it looks legit. - I'm feeling good now.
I like those. They're really slick.
for as many people as you can, call up and just say, " Hey, we're representing the Rickshaw Cab Company. "
if you don't wanna call 'em, then please come up with a list of people we can go see.
cold leads on this type of situation, calling and trying to sell somebody our products over the phone like that
most likely, they're gonna hang up.
[ Kwame ] I think Heidi--she's managing this situation with her mom...
as best as anybody could, if not better.
that's a difficult thing. I lost my mom to cancer when I was 1 5.
so I know that situation very well.
[ Heidi ] Hey, Mom, how you doing?
[ Kwame ] And it is distracting and it is something that is constantly on your mind.
can we sit down and talk to you? Sit, sit.
we have two beautiful women actually taking them around the city.
pedaling. These two beautiful women pedaling. - Exactly.
we wanted to see if you wanted to advertise on one of the rickshaws. - Sounds good to me. I'll do it.
I'm gonna have to go cash. I like it.
[ bill ] We went to two establishments tonight after-hours.
two of the three places that we visited this evening are gonna participate...
in our advertising campaign on the rickshaws.
we're gonna do it. For tomorrow, right?
[ telephone Line Ringing ] [ Woman ] Marquis jet.
[ Amy ] Hi. Is Ken there? - Hi, Amy. How are you?
just fine. How are you? I'm well.
I split off to make calls to people that we had previously made relationships with, like Marquis jet.
I'll do it under one condition. You've both gotta wear...
Marquis hats and Marquis shirts all day. Sounds like a deal.
Yes!
talk to you later. Okay.
guy from the rickshaw company asked me if they were gonna be selling any big-ticket items.
wonder what that's all about.
they're not riding rickshaws. In fact, they're not gonna even see the rickshaws.
how do you know they're not gonna see the rickshaws? 'Cause Heidi told me.
Really? Huh.
so what else do you know? If you guys ask me, I'll tell you.
you guys haven't stopped to actually ask me my opinion on things.
'if you guys would've asked for my opinion-- " I mean
I feel like we've asked-- You guys have not asked for my opinion.
and every time I've said anything, you guys have shut me up.
I'm being honest with you. It's convenient for you to use me...
when my looks take our
wait a minute. You don't use that yourself?
are you kidding me? It's not convenient for you either? Bill
we're a team, and we're either gonna win as a team or lose as a team.
I'm successful for a reason, and it's not solely because of my looks.
and I feel like every idea I came up with yesterday, You tossed.
I'm sick and tired of it, so I'm just like not gonna get involved anymore.
[ katrina ] Bill doesn't listen to any of my ideas.
he uses me whenever it's convenient for him.
whenever we go to a sales pitch, he turns to us and says, " Oh, these beautiful women will be driving. " But what about my ideas? I'm not a pinup doll.
riding a rickshaw because a woman would be riding a rickshaw that looked cute
and that's really offensive to me, to be honest with you. Right.
because I'm not successful because I dress cute.
I don't-- I believe in a democracy. I would never wanna run it like Troy.
I think you believe that, but your actions don't.
Yeah, well, apparently, in your opinion they don't.
I just don't agree with your leadership style.
[ bill ] The bottom line is this. Katrina doesn't like the way I lead.
my advice to her is step aside, then.
I think we're gonna have a very, very substantial portion of this building leased before we start construction.
[Trump ] Thinking outside of the box...
is something that is very much of a cliche.
but if you really wanna be successful, that's how you're gonna have to do it.
people love the beauty of the building, and they love the location of the building. And I think they like Trump.
[ Troy ] Old Donald Trump announced the task.
we gotta go ahead and manage a team of rickshaws for the day.
the team that generates the most money wins.
Kwame, come up with an incentive program for the rickshaw drivers.
the driver who earns the most money is gonna get an extra hundred dollars at the end of the day, FLat out.
the driver who earns the most before noon, You're gonna get an extra hundred dollars.
pretty simple. Are they good? Are they exciting? I'm excited about it.
all I can say now is really get out and make as much money as you can.
we're out of here. Kwame. Best of luck. All right. Go get it done.
[ Troy ] Heidi and myself are gonna go out and do the sales aspect of the rickshaw.
and Kwame will be the one doing the pedaling of the bike.
[ Kwame ] Any rides today? Any rides?
okay, this is gonna go on-- All these are going on one car.
these two on the side. Okay.
[ bill ] In order to win the task, we have to yield the biggest profit.
so we'd like to sell advertising in as much space as we can.
it's a great tool to generate income.
so we're converting the rickshaws into NASCARs.
all right, Warnock. Well on our way, baby.
I'm putting myself in for a horrible loss and the possibility of getting terminated.
so I weighed the risk and the reward, and at this stage of the game I need to hit a home run.
do you need a ride? I'm in. Go ahead.
hop in.
there we go. - Thank you very much.
pedicab ride. Would you guys like a pedicab ride today?
pedicab ride, ma'am?
sir?
rides today? Ride today?
[ Kwame ] I suck as a rickshaw driver. I don't know why.
I was ringing my bell.
I was asking people if they wanted rides. I don't know.
I wasn't successful as a rickshaw driver.
anybody need a ride?
Hey, guys. What's up, Bill?
sorry, bro. No problem.
this one is hanging tough. We have to go get another Acqua pazza picture.
we gotta get two, because this one fell off.
[ Nick ] If we don't have a good couple hours with this guy's signs up,
I think we should go back and give him a few hundred dollars back.
he has gotten a value out of this. Right.
you gotta put a price on that.
[ man ] Front desk. Umberto, please.
one of the side signs got destroyed on the pedicab.
are you gonna give me a credit or what?
we did have it out there for a good part of the morning.
fine. But you come here, we'll talk about it.
all right, fair enough. You wanna go meet this guy and handle this?
um, I could.
[ Nick ] I'm very big on business ethics. You have to be able...
to look them in the eye and be happy with the transaction.
cause without your reputation, you're pretty much finished.
think about the big picture, man. We need every penny we can get.
Hey, sir, would you like a ride on a rickshaw?
[ Amy ] We thought that we had these wealthy execs, investment bankers, hotshots in New York City.
surely we could get 50-dollar fares.
can he go with me? Uh-huh. Absolutely.
you wanna go two blocks to the court? Ten dollars a person.
ten dollars a person? We can walk the two blocks.
come on! [ Amy ] But, no.
these guys wouldn't ride a rickshaw with two lovely ladies.
so we were kind of shocked.
how about 25 bucks, both of ya?
come on. It's supporting a great cause.
the Marquis Jet? That's a great cause?
come on! You wanna ride on the rickshaw?
huh? Oh, yes, I can.
[ katrina ] Amy really will do anything to sell. She's too pushy.
she thinks that every man's in love with her...
and every woman wants to be her best friend, and she's wrong.
cute guys.
[ Troy ] We go to the " W " Hotel, and they say, " Hey, come back and talk to us. "
we go to our next meeting, which is Tavern on the Green.
we kind of get the same, " Well, come back next week and talk to us. "
[ Heidi ] We're getting killed right now. It's then and there that I realized, " Wait a second. We've sold about $ 1 00 worth of stuff. "
but we spent advertising dollars, and I added it up.
we'd only made $1 1 . 25.
okay, here's what I say. We need to take 20 minutes and map it out.
because right now, we're just walking aimlessly.
I agree.
I told 'em if you're lost in the woods, the first thing you never do is try to walk yourself out.
our rickshaw drivers are doing fine. I am not doing good being apart from you.
but I know the card works. She sells better face-to-face, but we don't have an opportunity to be face-to-face with anybody.
you were out riding the rickshaw not making anything.
so together, let's work on the number one thing, and that's having fun.
let me go change my clothes, and I'll
you wanna change? Sure.
I'm gonna hoop it up on that rickshaw.
and we either hoop it all the way to the bank or all the way to the boardroom.
[ Kwame ] Troy was wearing a suit earlier in the day. When he decided we were all gonna have fun, he basically said, you know, " I'm gonna put on my cowboy hat. "
and like Superman, he got in the booth and changed.
he was no longer Clark Kent.
he became Troy, the cosmic cowboy.
Yee-haw! Let's go!
how you doing? Yee-haw! You're gonna make a left.
we're making a left. Watch out! [ Truck Horn Honks ]
rickshaw, baby! Rickshaw cowboy!
here's a crowd of people. Get 'em, Troy. Get 'em.
[ bell Dinging ]
I'm the rickshaw cowboy! How you guys doing today?
rickshaw rides. I'll pull over and talk to people.
make a time for a Central park tour.
I'm pedaling, people are laughing. People are having fun. And, man, it just starts clicking.
we start selling these things, 'cause we're having fun and we believe in it.
got the Greenwich Village, Wall Street-- Okay, great.
Thanks. Thank you very much. You guys have a nice day.
sixty. You should see how I was doing it.
there you go. Getting it done.
so you're here to discuss a credit with me?
I just wanna give you back the $250. I appreciate that. That's very nice of you.
thank you very, very much.
you're welcome. Here you go.
thank you very much. We really appreciate it. You're very welcome.
thank you for giving me the opportunity. No problem.
all right. Thanks again. Take care. Bye-bye.
[ cell Phone Ringing ]
this is Nick. - Hey, Nick, how's it going, man?
it would've been so easy to just say, " Hey, come on, Umberto."
it was up there for a few hours and whatnot. "
but I wouldn't have felt good about it. And if I don't feel good about it, I'm not gonna do it.
that sucks, man. Damn!
Bye-bye.
Nick refunded him the whole amount of money. What?
for the one sign. I told him to offer him $1 00.
so Nick gave him the whole 250 back. He says, " I didn't feel right. "
but the guy got a half a day worth of advertising. I know.
so we lost 250.
we're spending more money doing refunds. There's no reason that we need to go show 'em that stuff.
[ bill ] We're playing for high stakes now. The other team, they're a creative bunch. They're hard-working.
you never know what could happen.
they could pick up a $3, 000 fare somehow, someway.
this is New York City. Nothing's out of the question.
[ Heidi ] Are you interested in a pedicab ride?
you want a ride? You and your loved one?
your lover?
you guys interested in Manhattan Show Company? No? You don't want a ride?
damn it! I can't win today. That's all right.
how did I go from corporate America to this? I just wanna know.
people need to have more sex, because everyone is just so miserable.
you guys-- You guys, is that Team Versacorp?
is that a " V " ? no.
where? On the flag.
no. Yes, it is.
[ Troy ] There you go.
[ Heidi ] What's that, you guys?
[ Troy ] We see the other team's rickshaw go by.
and I said, " By God, they might've sold advertising on the back of their rickshaws. "
that's a great idea. I didn't think of it.
are you okay? Yep.
how'd this tie work today? Good? No.
no? No, it usually works better.
is that all the money? Yeah.
[ bill ] At the end of today, we all got together and the drivers handed us their money.
these guys didn't make a ton.
what you got? Not a lot.
the results were very negligible. It was a very poor response.
I mean, I was disappointed.
I don't know, Bill. This one I think we won.
I don't know, man.
I hope we pulled it off, dude.
if we lose this task, Bill will definitely take me to the boardroom, and I'll be the first person to say that he was a horrible p. M.
how you doin'? How you doing?
people were everywhere.
I've been working hard. Good.
you guys did awesome. You got the largest single fare.
Really? From where?
the most money before noon was Elena.
Yea! Elena takes it home.
thank you very much. Unfortunately, we have a big boss meeting.
okay, let's go. We're leaving.
so, how'd we do?
I think we did pretty well. - You think you won?
we're cautiously optimistic.
so?
I think we had a fantastic day. We had a fun day.
we'll just let the-- But do you think you won?
I'm feeling cautiously optimistic.
could it be a fun day if you didn't win? Absolutely.
the day can't be taken away. - I've never liked losing personally.
George, how did they do? - Well, I got the results here from Versacorp.
from the cab fares, they didn't do well at all.
they got $65 1. 29 in the cabs.
but then, they went outside the box.
they decided they were gonna sell advertising.
and in the advertising, they got another $3, 450.
most of the ads, I see, were companies that you'd dealt with before...
or people that you'd dealt with before, so you already had a connection.
so as far as the total profit was concerned, their total profit was $3, 680 for the day.
not bad. - A little less than we anticipated, but we came in all right.
a lot of ads. Carolyn.
well, I followed protege around, and they focused heavily on transportation.
unfortunately, that's all they focused on was just transportation.
so they actually had a profit of $382. 68.
Wow. You didn't do very well.
did you think of advertising? - We didn't think of advertising.
so that's a pretty good thumping?
they gave us a good thumping without a doubt. All right.
for the winners, you did a great job.
after fighting traffic in the streets, You're going to take a ride around Manhattan...
on a gorgeous yacht called Calypso.
all of you are gonna do it. You're gonna have fun.
for the losers, this was just a romp.
at this stage of your job interview, I am not impressed.
I'll see you back at the boardroom. I may just fire all of you.
[ man ] How you doing? Hi.
I'm the captain. Welcome aboard Calypso.
do I get to take the wheel for a spin on this bad boy?
Cheers. Cheers. Cheers.
[ bill ] We had a little victory celebration. Had some drinks, had some toasts.
just kind of enjoyed the moment.
now we're talking, baby. I like it.
[ bill ] That's really what you have to do in this type of situation, because you don't really have a lot of time to savor the wins.
tomorrow's a new day, and we gotta move on to a new challenge.
so you cherish every minute that you have.
can you hand me one of those with the pecans on top?
this? Can I feed it to you?
[ laughing ] Thanks.
[ katrina ] Amy and Nick have some kind of love affair going on.
but I haven't quite determined whether she's playing Nick...
or Nick's playing her.
they're playing each other in some sort of strange way.
I think Amy thinks she's playing Nick, but I think in the end Nick'll win.
no, I just think that you're hard to read.
Yeah, that's a pretty good assessment.
and you're always staring off into space, and I'm wondering what you're thinking. You wonder what I'm thinking about.
and I'm intimidated.
intimidated? I think so.
I am a little.
are you being sarcastic? Yeah.
[ Nick ] Amy's a very strong player, and it's good to be semi-aligned with her, 'cause she's very, very sharp.
that can only help both of us.
this is getting very competitive at this point.
I don't think so. I think I'm still in partnership mode.
[ Amy ] Not only have I had 1 0 consecutive wins.
my goal at this point in time is now to make it to the end without ever losing. So we'll see.
cute.
[ Troy ] If we have to go into it and it just comes down to him and I, the only promise I make to Kwame is the warrior's code, and that is that my sword's gonna be sharp.
I'm gonna swing it hard and fast, and I'm gonna cut you clean.
and may the best man win.
[ Kwame ] Troy could get fired 'cause he's the project manager.
I could get fired 'cause Donald Trump is probably tired of my-- [ Beeps ] at this point.
Heidi could get fired just because she's still kind of on the periphery.
and even though Donald likes her, there wasn't really something substantive that he could point to and say, " Heidi, here's a reason to keep you around right now. "
at least she doesn't need to go into radiation.
it's not in the organs, which is good. But, you know, a little bit is still in her lymph nodes, and they wanna zap it out.
I really, really don't want you to go, so please don't go in there and resign.
cause I'll be pissed off at you. I swear to God, I won't. I'll be totally myself.
at the same time, Katrina, you have to prioritize what's important.
family is the most important thing to me in the world.
sorry, but my mom's health is a little bit more important than winning the pedicab task.
did Troy tell you what he's gonna say in there? - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
cause we're going there as a team tonight.
we're not going there like Omarosa and backstabbing and
you'll be fine.
Oh, my God. I gotta get ready.
so you guys had a good time though?
Yeah, it was a lot of fun. It was very windy.
I mean, it was like splashing water.
Troy, what time are we leaving? - I've got something to announce to you, Heidi.
I've made my selection. I'm taking you and Kwame to the board
[ Troy ] There's no pickingor selecting who goes into the boardroom.
there's three people on my team, and three people go into the boardroom.
so that accountability is on my shoulders.
ladies and gentlemen-- Ladies and gentlemen
we're going in as a team. Let's do the deed.
Hi. Hi. How are you?
good evening. Good evening.
so you were badly beaten.
you wanna be president of one of my companies?
at this stage, I didn't see any creative ideas from any of you.
so what happened? Troy, you're the leader.
we'd all come up with an idea that we thought was fantastic, and that idea was the prepaid rickshaw card services.
because we can only sell for one day within an eight-hour period, we thought, get the money today, but they can use 'em in the future.
the idea was fantastic. Heidi did a fantastic job on selling the cards that we had.
Kwame did a fantastic job on handling the finances and selling.
so how come the other team was so much better than you?
they had a brilliant idea that they came up with.
that you didn't come up with? That we did not come up with. Absolutely.
our idea was great. Theirs was brilliant. And sometimes, that's just the way it goes.
Heidi, how come you keep shaking your head? - I'm not shaking my head.
I'm not. It looks to me like you're disagreeing with what he's saying.
I'm not disagreeing. I'm really not. I do agree.
would you say that it's fair to say that...
you kind of put all of your eggs in one basket, came up with this idea, made a couple of appointments the day before, and did nothing after that?
would you say that was a fair assessment? - No, I wouldn't say that was a fair assessment.
okay, you came up with the idea of the prepaid. - Yeah.
what else did you come up with? - I can answer that question.
well, I directed it at Heidi.
you know what? He came up with that idea.
he was adamant on doing it, so I supported it. And to be honest with you, I thought that would be a good idea.
you think so now? - No.
you're saying this was basically Troy's idea?
he's the one who-- Again, just answer. This was basically Troy's idea--yes or no?
Yes, it was. Okay, that's it.
I got that part of it. - [ Troy ] Can I say one thing though?
sure. Even in comparing to the other team, because we're talking about the other team being so successful, which we all concur they are, wouldn't you say they put their eggs all in one basket also?
Yeah, but it worked.
did any of you drive the rickshaw? - I drove the rickshaw.
and how did you do when you drove it?
I stunk driving the rickshaw. Why?
uh, no particular reason. I went to all the areas suggested...
by the team of drivers who were experienced.
I went to Times Square. I went by Rockefeller Center. I went by St. patrick's Cathedral.
I rang my bell-- How many customers did you get?
I got zero customers. - So it was a big waste of time?
Kwame, do you think Troy did a badjob as the leader?
no, I don't at all. Do you think Heidi did something wrong?
no, I don't think they did anything wrong. - Who would you throw out?
just because Troy has been with me kind of throughout this experience...
and he's kind of exuded a lot of positive energy,
I would choose Heidi, but I think she's done a phenomenal job
you would choose Heidi to go out? - Yep.
who would you choose, Heidi? If I had to choose,
I would have to choose Troy, 'cause he was the p. M. and you have to take accountability.
do you have any other questions, Carolyn? - No.
do you have any other questions? - Doesn't anybody wanna ask me that question?
well, you're gonna be asked. 'Cause ultimately, you're gonna make the choice as to who goes out now.
you know that? No, I didn't know that.
well, that's what's gonna happen. All right.
normally, you keep two. Well, now you're down to three because you've been decimated.
so you're gonna choose one person to come back into the boardroom, one person to go back up to the suite.
who did the worst job of these two?
Kwame and I have made a decision with each other that it doesn't matter.
if he's the weakest link, by God I'm picking him.
and I've gotta be able to say that Kwame, he has supported us financially, he's taken care of all the finances
he also drove around today in a rickshaw all day long with nobody in it.
nobody in it. So that's a big waste of time, right?
we, as a team-- All right, listen.
enough of this. Who are you choosing to go up to the suite?
who are you choosing to stay with you? Somebody's getting fired.
I would have to say that Kwame goes upstairs. - All right.
Kwame, go upstairs. You two, go outside.
you'll be back in a minute.
see you guys. Best of luck to both of you. [ Heidi ] You too.
here we go, girl.
you're an-- [ Beeps ]
Ouch!
I did great on this task, and I did better than him on this task.
[ trump ] Who do you think should stay?
my feeling is that...
I don't think Heidi did a tremendous amount.
but I also think in this instance, the team leader came up with...
what I can't conceive of being a very creative idea, and I think a leader has to come up with something creative.
I think it might not have been a great idea, but at least he came up with something.
I have yet to see Heidi really come up with something.
I think she's riding on the coattails of everybody else.
is that woman on woman? That's tough stuff, right?
Yeah, maybe it is tough stuff, but I've seen nothing out of her.
at least Troy has the guts enough to come and say, " This was my idea. This is what I planned, and it failed. I'm accountable for it. "
so you think Heidi should go? I think Heidi should go. She hasn't shown me anything.
let's see. Robin, let 'em come in, please.
okay. You can go in to see Mr. Trump now. [ Troy ] We can go back in.
okay. All right. All right.
so what do you think, Troy? Why should you stay?
leaders are born. They're not made.
but if you are a born leader and it's in your genes, then you can build off of that.
you think you're a born leader? - Absolutely.
you think a born leader says that he or she is a born leader? - Absolutely.
there's no rule that says I can't. - So why should you stay?
I should stay because even though some of the tasks have failed,
I've been selected by my peers three times.
true. - I take risks. I don't ever take the cautious side.
[ trump ] Do you think Heidi is good or average?
I think Heidi's good. I think she's a good salesperson.
Absolutely. You think she's a good leader?
I think Heidi's a good salesperson.
I'd like to know-- - Wait, George. One second.
Carolyn had some very harsh feelings on Heidi and Heidi's performance.
say it. Well, my comments were, Heidi, in the time that we've been here, I have yet to really see anything out of you.
that's pretty harsh, right? - Yeah, I think it's very harsh. You're entitled to your opinion. I don't agree.
[ Carolyn ] Every time you've been on the losing team, you sit there and you go, " Yeah, yeah, you're right. We failed on that end. "
and that's what I've seen from you. You're entitled to your opinion.
of course I am, but it's obviously our opinion that matters.
I don't agree. I think I've done a great job here. I've been feisty.
do you think you've done a better job than Troy?
Yeah, I do.
why should you stay as opposed to Troy?
because I am a leader. I am feisty. I am aggressive.
I do the sales job good. I wanna be here.
but wouldn't you say he's also all of those things?
Yeah. - So why would you stay over him?
because as she said, she has yet to see me. She thinks I haven't done anything.
I'd like to prove myself-- that I can be a leader. I am a leader.
did you ask to be, or did you vote yourself or ask to be project manager for this particular task?
no, because we went in turns. - But he's three, you're one.
you're giving him a little bit too much power there then, huh?
unless you're setting him up to be the project manager.
no, I'm not setting him up at all. Um, he volunteered.
but everybody has said that he's a good leader, including you. Well, he is a good leader.
and nobody's said that about you.
there's no doubt in my mind anyway...
that you've all worked very hard and you're very enthusiastic.
what I've yet to see from either of you...
is that certain spark that sets you apart from somebody else and says, " Yeah, you can survive in an executive situation. "
for example, when we asked you the question who would you get rid of, you hedged.
if you feel somebody should go, they go, and you don't have to explain why.
explaining only makes you weaker as a leader.
George, I would say that I thought that you guys wanted an explanation.
and I went ahead and gave an explanation.
it was a long, boring explanation, and I didn't wanna hear it.
do you have anything else to say? No, I don't.
anything else to say? No, I don't have anything to say.
you've both come a long way. Somebody has to go.
somebody has to go right now.
you've done pretty well, and yet you've always been a loser.
as far as I'm concerned, You've lost all the time.
you haven't lost as much, but in this event...
you wouldn't step up as a leader, and you barely contributed as a follower.
Heidi, you're fired.
go ahead. Thank you, Mr. Trump. Thank you, guys.
[ Heidi ] I'm so glad for you. [ Troy ] Goodjob.
you done good.
I don't wanna be a manager. Give my love to Kat. I will.
[ trump ] I think Heidi is a remarkable woman.
she's got a lot going on. I just don't think...
she has the leadership skills to run one of my companies.
I like her, but really, it was time for her to go.
that was good, right? - Yeah.
[ george ] I loved it. All right.
this has been a great experience. I've had the best time.
met a lot of great people. Learned I could do things I didn't think I could do.
selling lemonade on the corner streets of New York City.
would I do it again? Absolutely.
you know, there's a lot of things to be learned from this game.
what I've learned from this game is I love being in sales.
I wanna stick to sales.
I'm ready to start selling again. It's been a great experience.
I'm glad I came this far. It's an honor.
[ trump ] Over three months ago, I invited 16 candidates...
to come to New York City for the chance to win the dream job of a lifetime.
trump Tower, please.
they came from all walks oflife.
some were self-made entrepreneurs.
others learned about business from some of the finest business schools in the country.
a few had only a high school diploma.
venture capitalists came to compete against copier salesmen.
but they all shared the same goal to work for me as my apprentice.
I divided the candidates into two teams-- men versus women.
they gave themselves corporate names.
what is your team name? - Versacorp.
here are your instructions.
each week, I assigned them a business task, and my executives, George Ross and Carolyn Kepcher, were on hand to observe and critique their every move.
well, they got the right guy up here. Yeah.
[ trump ] Each team elected a project manager...
who would be partially responsible for the team's success or failure.
I called the losing team into my boardroom, and the project manager picked two people...
that they thought contributed to the loss.
then, after each of them argued their case, one of them was fired.
you're fired. - You're fired.
this is a tough one. You're fired.
on the first four tasks-- - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
I couldn't believe how the women of Protégé...repeatedly outsmarted the men of Versacorp and easily won.
I'm starting to think that I may never hire a man again.
[ trump ] One by one, I fired David, jason, Sam and Bowie.
I am sick and tired...of getting our asses handed to us.
we haven't won--[ Beeps ] dude, and we're gonna be another man down as of tomorrow.
[ trump ] Versacorp was getting desperate.
but when I told the teams to manage Planet Hollywood,
bill thought Kwame went too far when he sold autographed basketballs.
thank you. - Was it borderline gray?
you know and I know it was. - I didn't sell the kid crack.
[ trump ] Meanwhile, the women of Protégé were having problems of their own.
being a bitch is gonna be your problem. You have to live with that for the rest of your life.
I didn't come here to make friends. I said that from day one.
[ trump ] By week five, the men were decimated, and I gave them a chance to pick new teams.
we're gonna do what we call in business a corporate reshuffle.
now, both groups consisted of men and women.
I am totally excited. This is a completely different dynamic, working with guys.
[ trump ] I then challenged the teams...
to buy items and resell them for a profit at a flea market.
Hey, you! Ten dollars!
[ trump ] And Versacorp finally celebrated its first victory.
good job, guys. I love you guys!
[ trump ] In the boardroom, Kristi didn't defend herself...
and was the first woman fired.
then I let Jessie go for being too timid.
Tammy drove her team nuts. Ereka lost her cool.
and Omarosa lost it completely.
I've been running around with my head killin' me, Kwame.
[ sobbing ]
Mr. Trump, I've worked for the last two weeks
we all have problems.
I don't like excuses.
Omarosa has to go. You're fired.
then I fired two more candidates-- Heidi and Katrina.
by week 11, I saw teammates Bill and Kwame emerge as rising stars...
with vastly different business styles and backgrounds.
bill has done an excellent job aligning himself with fantastic talent.
[ Troy ] Kwame's got a polished veneer. He's got a Harvard degree.
he knows how to interact with people.
[ trump ] At the Taj Mahal task in Atlantic City,
I required the candidates to attract and register new gamblers.
bill and Kwame had different strategies.
bill went for the VIP's.
the game was not gonna be won or lost on volume.
it was gonna be won or lost on the quality of player that you brought through.
[ trump ] Kwame went for shock value.
[ Kwame ] The tiger was [ Beeps ] phenomenal.
it was a very Donald Trump thing to do. Like in a basketball game, there's something demoralizing about dunkin'on the other team...
and giving 'em like a full just-- mmm!
when we brought the tiger out, we dunked on 'em.
[ trump ] And Kwame chalked up his first victory as project manager.
victory! Yes!
[ trump ] A week later, Kwame used his Harvard polish...to outshine his friend Troy's raw talent.
well, Troy, I have to say you're fired.
last week, I dissolved the teams, and the final four...
Amy, Nick, Kwame and Bill
faced a tough series of round-robin interviews with my top-ranking executives.
what are you gonna bring to the table other than your charisma?
[ Norma ] Do you consider yourself a loyal employee?
[ Charlie ] What do you think their perception is of why you're here?
cause I sure as hell can't figure it out.
thank you for your time.
[ trump ] My executives gave me their impressions in the boardroom.
who are you most impressed with? - Bill.
Kwame's got the long-term potential of what we're looking for.
what did you think of Nick? - I think he's a little bit too slick for his own good.
what did you think of Amy? - Amy kind of reminded me of a Stepford wife.
her answers were basically meaningless.
[ trump ] As a result, I fired two more candidates.
first, Nick. Then, Amy.
now, only two candidates remain.
bill, an idea man who started a multimillion-dollar cigar company, has come far due to his business savvy and his street smarts.
I've created some incentives.
whoever can ring up the most gross sales per hour gets $100 that hour.
you can win it again two hours later. You can win it again the next hour.
[ trump ] Kwame, a solid competitor...
who holds an MBA from the Harvard Business School, has managed to steer clear of conflict.
his management training and calm, collected manner...
has separated him from the pack.
we need to have as many people kind of on the front lines as possible...
with just a skeleton crew on the interior.
cause you don't wanna be out there while they're in session.
my management style is to have great people, tell 'em what to do, get the hell out of their way.
[ trump ] From the top of Trump Tower, the final two faced the future.
may the best man win. - I think we already have.
[ trump ] After weeks of testing their skills in business, from management to marketing,
I gave Bill and Kwame their final task.
bill, you'll run the Chrysler Trump Golf Tournament...in Briarcliff Manor at Trump National Golf Club.
Kwame, you'll be in charge of the Jessica Simpson concert in Atlantic City.
[ trump ] They drafted their former teammates to help them.
bill, it's your shot. Go ahead, pick.
I'm gonna pick Amy. - That's not a bad pick.
Kwame. - I'm gonna pick my main man in combat, Troy McClain.
I'm gonna pick Katrina. - Okay.
Omarosa. - Very good.
Nick. - Okay.
I will take Heidi. - Very good.
[ trump ] The situation turned grim almost immediately, as both Kwame and Bill found themselves in way over their heads.
bill was disorganized.
[ Amy ] You've got to be kidding. This many boxes?
Oh, my God.
the manager of my Trump National Golf Course, was not impressed.
this is a lot of stuff.
[ bill ] I'm not gonna worry about what Lesley thinks, 'cause I got a job to do tomorrow and I gotta get it done.
[ trump ] Meanwhile, in Atlantic City,
Omarosa received an important phone call from Diane, the head of transportation.
[ Diane ] I called Omarosa and told her...to make sure thatJessica and her band arrived when they were supposed to arrive.
this transportation has to be coordinated.
is there any way that you can go ahead and make the arrangements for the transportation?
because, unfortunately, we're sitting in the middle of a
what was your phone call? - I'm not gonna have that conversation with you.
[ Omarosa ] It really was not a big deal at all.
[ trump ] But the next day, Kwame heard a very different story from Omarosa.
let me get this story straight. You gave Omarosa a call last night at dinner about this issue.
Mm-hmm. - I called her before we ever went to dinner. - I'm talking about Mark Anthony.
but I didn't get her when they called me at Mark Anthony.
they just told me I needed to call back the office. She had already left.
[ trump ] As a result, not only did Kwame lose control over his team, he lost Jessica Simpson.
Jessica Simpson was missing. The driver was standing at her terminal, and there was no record of her.
you need to find out what the right flights are and what time these people are gonna be arriving.
[ trump ] Tonight, the two men go head-to-head...
in the final hours of the most demanding job interview ever.
both will return to the boardroom, but only one will be asked to stay...
and become the president of one of my companies.
only one will be given the dream job of a lifetime.
only one will be... the apprentice.
eight. Easy eight. Eight.
six. Easy six.
how do you lose a rock star?
[ Omarosa ] Jessica Simpson was missing.
she was nowhere to be found.
debrief in our sweatbox here. Yeah.
I spoke to her aboutJessica missing.
and then she never called me back. So I never talked to her about her travel route.
[ Kwame ] Omarosa just totally dropped the ball.
I would fire Omarosa because she's not competent, but I didn't have the luxury of doing that.
Hi, is this Jessica?
Hi, Jessica, it's Omarosa. How are you?
where are you located now?
are you in the hotel? [ Kwame ] Actually, what happened was...
Jessica Simpson's people had booked their own transportation.
no one had told us that, and we booked transportation on top of that. It confused Jessica a little bit.
but in the end, she arrived safely.
so Omarosa and I went to meetJessica in her suite.
how are you, sir? How are you?
Kwame Jackson. Nice to meet you.
can we come on in? Absolutely.
thank you. All right. Hi, there.
good to meet you. Hi, Nick. Is everything to your liking?
it's amazing. Beautiful.
it's huge. How are you? Nice to meet you, Miss Simpson.
nice to meet you too. My name's Kwame. This is Omarosa, my colleague.
when I couldn't find you, I said, " I have lost the biggest rock star in the country. "
I was so confused. I didn't know what to do.
so I called my production manager, 'cause he was the only one I could get ahold of.
we went through the back way. You're being a trouper, so thank you so much
Oh, yeah, no, it's fine.
believe me, logistically, we're gonna make sure that everything is really, really tight.
thank you again. Thank you.
see you in the morning. - See you in the morning. All right.
thank you. [ Kwame ] Everything was straight. We got everything covered.
there was a few balls up in the air, but all the major stuff is taken care of, and I feel good about that.
good morning. What's going on, other than it's cold and dark?
[ bill ] Saturday morning, I think we got up at about 4: 30.
we wanted to get to the country club by 6: 00.
I'd rather have more time than not enough time.
I saw somebody in here earlier.
Hello? Ah, back again. How are you?
[ bill ] I got the troops up early, and they were supportive.
when I popped my head out of the door at 5: 15, Katrina was ready to go.
it was the first time in 13 weeks that she's been ready to go on time. So I gotta give her credit.
I owe her one, that's for sure.
I was given the task ofbeing the tournament director at Trump National Golf Course.
it was the Chrysler Trump Golf Invitational...
benefiting the Ike Austin Diabetes Foundation.
I knew it was gonna be a great day. Good morning.
how are ya? One thing, though.
we somehow
in transition, we misplaced a Marquis Jet sign.
it was delivered a few days ago, and it was put in a model home, we think.
give me a description of it. It's a sign that says " Marquis Jet. "
I think it's a black sign with white lettering.
all right, I'll take a look. If I locate it, I'll call you.
how you doin'? All right? Is there anything that we should
looks like you're gonna have a heavy frost delay.
so it looks like it's gonna be 10: 30 or so.
that's gonna-- Ooh. Yeah, it's gonna push you back.
okay. It's gonna screw up your schedule a little bit.
what do you normally do when there's a frost delay in an outing?
sit around and drink a lot of coffee and talk, and that's it.
that's all they can do. Okay.
[ bill ] To preserve the condition of the course, you can't go out there...while there's frost on the grass, 'cause the grass cracks, and it causes a lot of problems.
we were supposed to tee off at 9: 00 am and the superintendent said...
that it was gonna be a 10: 30 start now because of the frost.
so it was an hour and a half delay.
we're gonna have frost delay today, so we're gonna be delayed about an hour, it looks like.
I haven't really processed it yet.
it's probably a good thing that I haven't, because I don't wanna stress out.
I wanna stay relaxed. I wanna stay calm.
I'm worried about the sign. That's a problem.
where was it seen? Katrina said she saw it in the model home.
[ line Ringing ]
how you doin'? Sorry to bother you. You haven't, by chance, had any luck with that Marquis Jet sign, huh?
they're a big sponsor, and if we lose that sign, it could be a little bit of a problem.
[ Amy ] We had quite a few signs from our sponsors that were lost or missing.
that was a pretty stressful situation for me and I think for Bill as well, because we had contractual obligations to display the signs that were lost.
it's says " The Marquis Jet Card, " and it's black in color, I believe.
[ bill ] We had to maintain good relations with the sponsors.
I knew that was critical. These people were putting up a lot of money.
if you see that Marquis Jet sign, just let one of us know.
okay. Thanks a lot.
[ bill ] just as we're looking for the Marquis Jet sign, the two Marquis Jet representatives were approaching.
you guys cool? Yeah, I think we're good.
everything's all right? What time
we're looking at 10: 30. This is kind of the temporary time.
we're gonna get an update in about five minutes.
and what time will we bring-- will the sign go up?
as soon as we get clearance to drive on the course.
no one can go on the course right now just 'cause of the frost. Yeah, the frost.
just have some coffee, donuts, whatever. I'm in the main office if you need me.
someone will be able to get ahold of me.
[ bill ] They're the Marquis Jet owners.
do you think you have any idea where it's at? - Right in here.
it was big. I'm gonna come with ya.
[ beeps ] Almighty. If that's it, I'm gonna freak.
please tell me it's in here.
you know, I'm gonna take a run down to the Dumpster, just for some weird chance that it got thrown out.
I'll be right back. Thanks.
sweet Ginger Brown.
how this [ Beeps ] ended up here, I don't know.
[ Amy ] We had so many boxes of crap...
that I think that getting rid of the mess in the office, we picked up the Marquis Jet sign that was in a box...
and assumed that it was trash.
I think we have metal stakes to go into this foam core. And then they go in the ground.
[ bill ] And it was literally about a five-second gap...between when the sign was found and when the Marquis Jet guys were walking in.
so, I mean, it was as if we had it waiting for them when they pulled up. It was great.
we're gonna have fun there, you guys.
uh, here's the deal. 8: 30, um
8: 30, your place. We're gonna meet here...with the folks from Operation Smile.
[ Troy ] This morning, Kwame and myself had a meeting...with Didi Sides and Beth from Operation Smile.
Jessica Simpson is the spokesperson for Operation Smile.
what it is it's for children that have cleft pallets and trying to get operations for 'em.
they can't afford the operations.
this is what a screening looks like. It's a two-week medical mission.
and what we primarily do are cleft lips and cleft pallets. - Okay.
and that's it right there. There's your before picture and your after picture.
[ Kwame ] I got up at 6: 30 this morning after going to bed at 2: 00.
so not much sleep for the weary.
the big event for the morning is obviously the 10: 00 breakfast, along with the Operation Smile folks,
mark Brown, the CEO of the Taj Mahal, and Jessica Simpson and her husband.
good morning. I think you know these folks.
thanks for having us this morning. Absolutely. Come in.
this is George. How are you?
and Mark Brown. How are you?
[ Kwame ] Omarosa was originally in charge of the breakfast.
she said she did not have capacity, and whether we could take it over. Troy took over the breakfast.
we walked in at 1 0: 00, and no one had begun anything.
it was at 10: 00. No, no one said specifically 10: 00.
not to us. So if you'd like, what we can do...as quickly as possible, just try to get some cold stuff up here.
what happened? Well, I think that...
Kwame was under the understanding it was specifically at 10: 00.
but we were not told it was specifically at 10: 00. Did anyone talk to Food and Beverage?
Yeah, we did talk to Food and Beverage.
Troy took over the breakfast.
unfortunately, Troy never got back to me to say it was specifically 10: 00 or not.
[ Omarosa ] Troy had a meeting with Jay, the head of catering for the Taj Mahal, and talked about the logistics for the VIP breakfast.
he did not follow up with Jay after that meeting to make sure that everything was done.
can we have the butlerjust prepare breakfast for Miss Simpson to her liking?
I'll get something as quickly as I can.
let me run. My apologies, Jay.
may I speak with you for a moment, please? Can you excuse us for a second?
[ Omarosa ] Kwame is being extremely laid-back, and I think that he needs to be a little more intense...
andjust exert a little more energy when it comes to these things.
I know he's being very cool about it, and I don't want to see him acting erratic, but he needs to be a little more expressive.
[Jay ] Once the breakfast was turned over to Troy, I had no contact with Troy.
at all? - No. So
[ mark ] So we're all walking in assuming the food's all sitting there and set.
nobody spoke to Food and Beverage. How can it be set?
we just kind ofknocked on the door. I don't even know if Nick knew we were coming at 10: 00.
you know I'm pretty upset about the whole thing, because it makes us look bad.
Yes. You're not prepared. I said to you, " Check. Double check. Recheck. "
you counted on Troy. First, it was you. You passed it on to Omarosa.
she passed it on to Troy. Troy never talked to Food and Beverage.
this is you. Don't count on them. They're not here anymore.
you are. Okay.
[ mark ] Kwame's team killed him.
his selection hurt a lot what he did here today.
looking at Kwame under pressure, he seems to be cracking a little bit.
are you stressed like I'm stressed?
Troy, you in the office? - No, I'm up in the room.
Hey, guys. How are you?
[ Heidi ] Good. How are you? [ Troy ] How did it go?
uh, there was a big snafu.
Why? The food wasn't ready.
what? The food wasn't ready.
did it all work out, though? - It all worked out, but Mark was upset with me.
that part didn't go-- I mean, it's worked out, but it didn't go over well.
but, you know-- - [ Troy ] I told Jay Chesterton and Omarosa
I know you did. I mean, Troy made an error with the breakfast.
but when Troy told me that breakfast is gonna take place at this time, we've had this meeting, we told this person that, that's all you can do.
I can't after that go back and say, you know, " Jay, did my team actually sit down with you? Did they actually tell you this time? "
I mean, that's just-- To me, that's just micromanaging people.
I think that's a bull--[ Beeps ] management style.
so when I got there, Jay was like, you know, " I didn't know how many people. I heard 9: 30. Then I heard 10: 00. "
but you, me and Omarosa talked to him the night
and nothing was prepared. Okay.
[ bill ] How often do you normally get updates on the frost?
as often as you check in with them.
I figured it was in the last half hour. We're looking at 10: 30. Okay.
[ lesley ] The frost delay is gonna push back the tournament.
it's gonna push back the reception. It's gonna push everything back, and it's gonna just sort of put a little kink in the plans...
with Bill's schedule of events.
so we'll see how Bill handles it.
have you seen Mr. Trump? Do you know anything about him? We have Mr. Trump fully accommodated.
I've got him ready to go, so when he walks up, his stuff is good.
his caddie has the bags, has his irons.
do you know when he's arriving? We do not know when he's arriving.
be aware of his arrival. Absolutely.
[ horn Honks ]
there's no one manning the gift table at all.
that's gotta get taken care of, 'cause it looks like-- [ Beeps ]
Katrina, I'm in front of the gift table. Where you at? Nick, any update on that frost delay?
Hi, Harvey. Hi, everybody.
it's exciting, huh?
beautiful. Hello. Mr. Trump, Brian Davenport. Nice to meet you.
nice seeing you. Thanks for your hosting.
will you just check on the frost delay and get an update for me on what the frost delay is looking like?
no cheating. [ All Laughing ]
okay? No cheating.
Mr. Trump. Is he doing a goodjob?
he'd better be doing a good job. He'll get fired so fast.
he'll be fired like a dog.
your clubs are okay? Your bag and everything? Everything's perfect.
[ bill ] Mr. Trump announced to everyone there that if I screw this one up, I was gonna get canned.
he did it in a joking manner, but, you know, it's true. There's a lot of pressure.
obviously, I wanna win this, because from a financial standpoint it's gonna be great, and from an opportunity standpoint.
there's a lot at stake here. You definitely feel the pressure bearing down on your back.
when are we, uh-- When are we going out?
we have a frost delay right now. We're looking at at least an hour to an hour and a half delay.
no later than 10: 30. We're supposed to go to Atlantic City from here.
we're working on it. - No later than 10: 30.
Troy dropped the ball so bad on this breakfast.
we've gotta rebound from the breakfast with an awesome meet and greet.
the problem is also you have to realize I was in charge of it.
and now, I don't mind it 'cause it's good. It's a helpful hand. But now, Troy's also in charge of it.
and it's too many chefs in the kitchen.
[ Heidi ] The meet and greet was my responsibility.
and then Kwame said, " Troy, you're gonna help Heidi with it. "
I felt that Kwame didn't trust me enough. And if that's the case, when the morale's not there and you're like, " My boss doesn't trust me, " screw that.
[ Heidi ] Can I just express my concerns right now?
it's not personal. Well, it actually is.
[ coughs ] This is what I have a problem with.
I was in charge of meet and greet. You also put Troy in charge, which is fine. If that's the way you wanna do it, that's fine.
I don't know if you don't trust me. [ Kwame ] I asked him to help you.
but he is helping a lot, which I don't mind. Okay.
but here's the thing. I know he's your right-hand man.
but then don't say, " Okay, you're in charge of meet and greet. " Because you have put us both in charge of it.
I have not. You are in charge of the meet and greet. But you had put Troy in charge of both.
now I feel like, " If something happens bad, it's all on you, Heidi. "
if something happens bad, Heidi, it's all on me, actually.
let me clarify it right now. You are in charge of the meet and greet.
I want you to run it and structure it appropriately.
make the decisions that are necessary to make it a successful event.
Troy's a copilot to help you with the meet and greet.
if something were to go wrong-- I have never done a meet and greet in my life.
I don't know if autographs-- - I've never done a meet and greet either.
he's never done a meet and greet. Everybody's doing stuff for the first time.
that's why I'm relying on you and your expertise to try to get it done. That's it.
I've never done it. I'm not saying I'm any better at it or not.
all I'm saying is I can't be in all these different places.
that's why I've just delegated it out, just like I delegated promotion to him, logistics to her,
I'm delegating meet and greet to you, so you can be successful with it.
[ Kwame ] Heidi makes mountains out of molehills, and she gets so uptight about the littlest things...
that she creates stressful situations in episodes where...
you really don't need to be stressed out, and you need to just push through and execute.
and if you need help, that's what he's there for as your copilot.
whatever you'd like to do. It's your meet and greet.
look, everything--gone.
you're gonna move the furniture? Yes, the furniture will be back to its original condition.
okay. I'd like that done as soon as possible.
that's hot on my priority list. Okay, good.
that's how-- I thrive under the pressure.
and to me, that's fun.
I'm always doing a hundred things at once.
I like to operate at a fast pace. Some people don't like that style.
but to me, that's the only way to do it.
Katrina, that office, it's gotta get taken care of. [ Katrina ] All of the caddies?
get one of 'em to take care of that. Just listen to me. Where do you want me to put it?
I don't care. Just put it out here. We can put it underneath the table.
get it done. Trust me. Okay.
as soon as somebody can, I'll do it.
see, this is what he needs to stop doing, Amy.
bill's like this, and we're like this.
I'm the type of person where I get myjob done, but don't ask me 20 times whether I'm doing it.
[ lesley ] Bill went in and out of the club house at least 150 times today.
I see him running around an awful lot, and he shouldn't be running around.
it doesn't look that great from the players'standpoint...for the tournament director to be running around.
okay.
he wants you over there in eight minutes.
how are we doing on the final pairings? Is that done? Done.
everything's done? All the athletes are all paired up and
you know what I'm about to say? I gotta ask. I've gotta ask.
I thought we had an agreement yesterday that when you ask me once-- Okay, fine. Fine.
[ Amy ] Mr. Trump works in an environment that...you have to deal with stressful situations all the time.
if he's that panicked...
and in such a frenzied state...
on something that is as simple and as organized as a golf tournament, then I think that it's gonna be tough for Mr. Trump to be able to say, " Yeah, Bill, I'll put you in charge of a company...that has a lot of problems and that you need to fix. "
[ bill Over Radio ] Amy, come in. Amy.
there's no way that I would ask you five times if you did something. Never.
because it's getting out of control.
if you ask me 15 times the same question
and I'm almost about to the point that I'm not gonna do it.
I, right now, don't think Bill will win.
and it makes me very sad.
got it. On the way to the ballroom.
[ Heidi ] I've been put in charge of the meet and greet.
it's really critical because it's where...
the fans and the VIP guests can meetJessica, get autographs and photographs of her.
I think Kwame should have given me more.
it's really important not to underestimate me.
I am very competent. More competent than Troy, to be honest with you.
how do you want that set?
God, I'm so new to this.
they told me to prepare for 50 people, and the capacity in the room wouldn't hold 160.
we definitely have a problem, that's for sure.
[ man ] There's a lot of information that's not being shared amongst the team.
Kwame, when you get a chance, please come to the ballroom.
at one time, there was only approximately 30 casino guests...
and 50 radio station winners for the meet and greet.
it was communicated to Troy yesterday that...
it was actually approaching 100 for the casino.
that was communicated to Troy, but never made it to Heidi.
Hi, I'm Donnie. Nice to meet you. Kwame. How are you?
[ woman ] Yesterday, we presented a list to Troy...
of 92 VIP guests. Mm-hmm.
um, no one told them.
[ Kwame ] So now we're talking a total of-- 150, potentially.
okay. So what we had planned to do in the room is actually just have traffic flow.
we're gonna have people come in the room in small groups, sign autographs from Jessica Simpson, congregate for a small time with Operation Smile, and then head out.
so it wasn't gonna be a full hundred-plus-- Not all in at the same time.
Yeah, that was the goal. Is that okay?
if that works for you, yeah. Okay.
great.
[ george ] Kwame's handling it well. I think it's by far a very difficult task to do.
he seems to have it fairly much under control.
putting all the pieces together and seeing that it runs smoothly is a real challenge.
I think Kwame's doing very well. [ Kwame ] I'll be back shortly.
if you need me, I'll be back shortly. Yeah, please come back.
I'm nervous, but any good leader knows...
that if the leader's freaking out...
and you're the person who's running around like Chicken Little with your head cut off, then that's the tone that you can't project to the team and to the people who are evaluating you.
[ Heidi ] You want me to bring 'em in here? See if it works.
if it's chaotic, it's all Troy's fault.
I'm blaming you already, Troy. Oh, my God. He is absolutely to blame.
Heidi was in charge of the meet and greet. If you walked into the room...and you looked at who seemed like they were in charge of the meet and greet, it was Troy.
I would really like everybody to listen to Heidi.
we wanna make sure that everybody knows she's the boss.
here's how it's gonna work, everybody.
Troy's bringing in our VIP guests.
he's talking to them like they were third-graders.
when the line starts, I would like everybody to come right here
'Everybody stand against the line. " " Do as I say. "
you just can't speak that way. How he handled it was wrong.
Heidi's my pit bull. She's gonna keep an eye out.
but the line starts right here. Is everybody clear on that?
go for Omarosa. Go for Omarosa.
please bear with me. I was told she should be here within the next five minutes.
go for Omarosa.
[ Omarosa ] Mark, you forgot about me and my tambourine.
I'm sorry. You know, we put in a request for a tambourine.
[ Kwame ] It's hard to get in touch with Omarosa.
she won't pick up the phone.
[ man ] Is, um, Miss Simpson wrapping up?
I have told them five times that we need to leave. Okay.
go for Omarosa. Go for Omarosa. Go, Kwame.
can you just give me an ETA on Jessica's arrival at the meet and greet?
5: 30, 5: 35 at the latest.
[ Kwame ] Omarosa's taking Jessica to the meet and greet.
Heidi and Troy are running the meet and greet right now, so everything's clicking.
here's Jessica. Okay, let me go meet her.
just go to the end of the line right there. We'll have you guys to the end of the line.
you can sit right over there.
okay. Hi!
if you guys could come in a little bit, 'cause we're actually gonna have more guests.
behind the rope. Go ahead right behind the rope.
[ Kwame ] On a project like this, it's really, really hard...to check every detail of everything.
my leadership style requires talented people. I put faith in the fact that I think that they're competent.
I cannot micromanage people. - Smile for the camera, right here.
it's like, you're doing your job and you're doing everybody else's job too.
and to me, that's not the definition of a manager.
okay, let's go play golf. Come on.
enough of this.
let's win it. Kick ass.
[ bill ] Once the tournament got underway, I felt the weight slowly coming off my back.
good drive.
I'm kind of changing gears. I'm going to event-planning mode.
we got a beautiful dinner planned tonight. just making sure that that goes off without a hitch.
so I got a schedule-- I'll put it in your box-- of what's gonna transpire tonight here.
[ bill ] Lesley and Carolyn run a tight ship there.
it's a very, very exclusive country club. They have a certain standard.
so today was obviously a high-stress day.
but I feel as if we've covered every critical point that was there.
Presentation-wise, I think it looks great.
how do you think it looks? It looks great.
[ Carolyn ] Overall, I think Bill did a greatjob.
there's a lot of things that go into this whole production.
were there quite a few hiccups along the way? Absolutely.
is that par for course? Absolutely, it is.
onward. Yeah. I mean, so far so good.
[ Amy ] Trump National's probably the most beautiful course I've ever seen.
Mr. Trump spent 30 million dollars renovating it...
and created a truly spectacular course.
okay, fellas, let's go.
the leaves are changing, the air is crisp.
and then you've got about 100 good-looking men out there in their golf uniforms.
it's hard to beat.
beautiful. Thank you.
I'm Bill. Nice to meet you.
you guys having fun today? Good.
Yeah! There you go.
birdie. Beauty.
well, nobody's beaten us so far. [ Chuckling ]
beautiful shot. Ah, I love that.
I love this game.
how you doing? - Good. Trump's on his way in now.
so we're gonna take care of that.
let's follow you-- Okay.
how'd you shoot? We shot well. We were 18 under.
I can't see losing. - I like that style.
isn't that nice? That's
[ bill ] Mr. Trump's foursome won the tournament.
it seemed like he was impressed with how seamless everything was.
I was pleased. I think everything was relatively flawless.
I first wanna thank everyone for coming out today, because this is really a worthy cause.
Ike has donated a lot of his time and his energy...to helping out preventing diabetes.
well, I just wanna thank everybody for being here. You've raised a lot of money.
and congratulations on doing a greatjob. I don't know if you're gonna win or not, but congratulations on doing a good job. Thank you, sir.
[ trump ] Good luck.
Hey, Pete, how you doin'? Good, good.
bill's performing like Joe Willie Namath in 968, Jets/Colts.
bill's the man for the job, and he's just doing a wonderful job.
you want a Diet Coke? What is this?
the Trump Salad. I'll have that.
[ trump ] It went great. We played well. My team was really good.
we really had a good round of golf. I'm going now to Atlantic City to the Taj Mahal...to see how Kwame is doing with Jessica Simpson.
[ Kwame ] I'm meeting Donald Trump on the helipad in a minute, so I wanna get a briefing together.
I'm gonna let him know that everything's under control.
how are you, Mr. Trump? Let's go. Let's go.
I just wanted to offer you a quick briefing on what's going on. Tell me what's going on.
Jessica Simpson and her family have arrived here at the hotel. Good.
we had breakfast this morning with Mark Brown... Good.
and the folks from Operation Smile.
after that, they did their sound and rehearsal check.
and now we're in the progress of doing the meet and greet...with Jessica Simpson in terms of autograph signing.
and where are they now? They're in Diamond Ballroom " A. "
so we'll go see her now, right? Correct.
thank you, ladies. [ Troy ] The meet and greet seems to be going well.
signing autographs. Jessica Simpson's getting a little edgy.
6: 00 is rolling around.
she's concerned about her time. She's concerned about her time.
I'm gonna have to eat. I still have to get my hair and makeup done. What time is it?
go for Heidi. Go for Troy. Mr. Trump is on his way. He's just landed.
okay, Kwame, thank you very much. We're working on the talent.
Donald Trump's on his way down from the helipad, and he wants to meet with Jessica Simpson in the meet and greet.
just let us know. I just found out two seconds ago.
then they should let us know, becauseJoseph was really like, " Get her out of here. "
I just found out two seconds ago. All right.
open this door for me. [ Heidi, Indistinct ]
no, no, no. It's her.
okay, we might as well get out of here too.
how was your flight in? Beautiful.
it's the only way to travel, Kwame. One day.
some day, you'll be traveling like that, I predict. One day.
Mr. Trump is on his way. Where's Jessica?
I don't know. What are you gonna do? [ Troy ] There's noJessica Simpson.
I left the room for two seconds. I'm not in charge of the lady.
Omarosa had left too.
I'm trying to get ahold of Omarosa.
so what we'll do-- We just need to stay calm in front of these guys so they don't panic.
[ trump ] Wow. Look at this. Wow.
Donald Trump walks in. There's noJessica Simpson.
I have no clue, Donald Trump has no clue. Kwame's right behind Donald Trump too.
I cannot get ahold of Omarosa. Okay.
so what we're doing is-- She chose to leave.
we informed her that Mr. Trump was coming, and she said she was late for her concert.
Hi, everybody.
let him know that she's left. I am. I am.
I just wanted to let you know, obviouslyJessica will not be returning. She needs to go straight to stage.
I can go up there. Should we go up there?
so she goes on at 8: 00, right, Kwame?
she goes on at 8: 00. We'll go backstage.
Kwame, where is she? - She should be here.
go for Omarosa. Go for Omarosa.
come on, Kwame. Time is money.
[ static ]
come on, Kwame. Let's go.
[ sighs ]
how they doing, John? Good.
typical, typical. [ Heidi Over Radio ] Go for Omarosa.
so where the hell are they?
[ laughing, Chattering ] [ Kwame ] Go for Omarosa. Go for Omarosa.
[ laughing ] Oh, my God! You look fierce.
[ Omarosa ] Yeah, you know, I'm feeling this. - What bird died for that?
Tina, what do you think? [ Woman ] I think it looks good on you.
go for Omarosa. - She's up in her room.
Oh. Yeah. We've been paging.
okay, where did Omarosa go?
okay, Kwame, there's a possibility Jessica Simpson might be up in the suite already.
[ trump ] Is it easier for us just to go upstairs?
come on. Let's go, man.
[ Kwame ] We went up to the suite. It's me, Mr. Trump and Melania.
he rings the doorbell. - [ Muttering ]
[ Omarosa ] Who's there? How are you? Nice seeing you.
at the door of the suite was the lovely Omarosa.
Hi. Good to see you again. Hi. How are you?
this is Melania. Good. After you. Come on in.
[ trump ] Hello, everybody. How are you? - Hello.
how are you? It's so nice to meet you. Nice seeing you. Terrific.
[ trump ] Hey, Nick. Melania loves your show.
[ Melania ] Yeah, it's so cute. It's really cute. Oh. Thank you.
[ Kwame ] Omarosa I would never hire, because...
she's very intelligent, but she's a space cadet.
you go have a good time. Enjoy it. I will.
[ trump ] We really look forward to watching.
[ Kwame ] It's hard to get in touch with Omarosa on a walkie as well as on a beeper.
she wastes a lot of time and a lot of effort.
I don't have time for that. That's not how business is done.
see you in a little while. Okay. Good.
[ Kwame ] This was the first time that I thought I could be fired.
have fun. All right.
[Jessica ] My advice to Kwame is just to relax.
just know that everything is gonna work out. There's always gonna be flaws, but don't ever let them know that there are flaws happening.
make it like everything's perfect.
[ trump ] Is she here? Is she ready? She's here.
she's getting her earpiece in, and she'll be right out.
here she is. There she is.
[ trump ] Beautiful. Hi, Jessica. Okay, let's go.
thank you, Mark.
well, I just wanna congratulate my staff-- Kwame and everybody
because for Operation Smile, they've raised thousands of dollars, really in Jessica's honor.
and on behalf of Donald Trump,
I'm gonna make a $25, 000 contribution, Jessica.
okay? So, good luck. [ No Audible Dialogue ]
now, the person you've all been waiting for, [ Audience Cheering ]
Jessica Simpson.
enjoy her. Thank you.
[Jessica ] Let me hear you!
[ Kwame ] I definitely feel like the concert was successful.
it was sold out. I think the fans were pleased.
the meet and greet went well. Overall, the day went really well.
I feel like I've come to the end of a long journey.
I know I've done a goodjob. There are some areas I could have done better.
I learned a lot about myself, and I spent a lot of time with Donald Trump.
that in and of itselfhas been a really valuable experience for me.
learning from this icon and learning how he makes decisions...
and learning how he thinks about strategy.
that was one of my objectives in coming on this whole, you know, big journey.
thank you so much! I had so much fun!
thanks for coming. Enjoy. The bar is open. I'll be seeing you throughout the evening. Thank you.
[ bill ] I'm feeling pretty good right now. I'm using the analogy of running a marathon.
I finished. I don't know whether or not I won the race, but I crossed the finish line, and that's an accomplishment in itself.
we've been through war and back, girls and boys.
you genuinely had my best interest in mind today.
and very rare in life can you meet people who genuinely wanna see you do well.
it's rare that you find people like that in this world, honest to God.
this is a lovefest. All right, Nick, give me a hug, man.
this is a lovefest. [ Katrina ] The whole team worked better today than it ever has before.
the reason is because Nick, Amy and I are no longer competing.
we're trying to all achieve the same goal for one person.
there's not this many people that I would work this hard for, especially not paid. Thanks for getting up so early.
Thanks, guys, really. I appreciate it.
[ bill ] Last night when I went to bed, I said a little prayer.
I said, 'Just let me do the bestjob, I can, God, and let me be who I am. "
and my prayers were answered. - Trump Tower, please.
I was Bill Rancic. I gave them a true representation of who I am, and I'm comfortable with whatever the outcome is.
I'd like to thank everybody for working hard, when you didn't have to, and pulling together.
it's finally over. On three. [ Indistinct ]
[ Together] One, two, three, Apprentice! Whoo!
[ Kwame ] Obviously, my team doesn't have to give me any support, because they have nothing to lose.
they've been great. They've stayed up late, gotten up early and been high-energy.
all right, I'm gettin' in the crib.
[ Kwame ] I wanna be the apprentice and take advantage of the opportunity.
like I told Donald Trump, " I'm tired ofbeing in training. "
[ Kwame ] Take care. All right, guys. Take care.
Donald Trump is an icon. He's someone who, when people said you couldn't do it, always got it done.
this is the final boardroom. It's kind of surreal.
I don't think I've fully digested it at this point.
I didn't sleep a wink last night. I was tossing, I was turning. I don't know what to expect.
[ Kwame ] This one is kind of bittersweet.
it brings the game to a conclusion, but at the same time, who knows what's gonna come out of it?
it could be a whole new chapter in, you know, my life.
[ bill ] The next few hours, my life could change drastically.
I could be in a completely different echelon oflifestyle than I am now.
I could have an opportunity that could change my kids' lives.
you could start talking about generational wealth. That's pretty powerful stuff.
[ Kwame ] I'm gonna try to respectfully take Bill down.
that's it. That's all I can do. And he's gonna try to do the same.
I've worked with Bill enough now to figure out how he thinks...
and what he might think of and try to counter some of that.
[ bill ] We're gonna be going head-to-head, mano a mano against each other.
when it's a one-on-one scenario, I'm gonna do well.
it's gonna be a battle down to the end, I think.
say good-bye to the loft.
all right. Good luck. Take it easy.
Thanks. Hi, Robin. Thanks.
can you please have a seat over there? - Sure.
Thanks. -[ Bill ] Well, we're here.
I'm glad that in the end, it came down to somebody I respect.
cause I can make peace with that, you know? Me too.
Hi. - Hello. How are you? - Hello. How are you?
[ Omarosa ] Hey, gentlemen. - You can go right into the boardroom.
good evening. - Come on in.
so how did you like the Trump Taj Mahal? - It was very nice. Thank you for having us.
did Jessica do a goodjob? - She did a great job.
did you think it was a great concert? It was a great concert.
she's got talent. She's good. Did you think Jessica was very beautiful?
she's a pretty girl. - Pretty or beautiful?
she's beautiful. Come on. - [ Trump ] I thought she was beautiful.
a beautiful girl. We can all agree on that.
I'm not asking you! What the hell do I have to hear about you for?
I don't need to hear your answers.
I'm not a guy. - [ Trump ] Holy mackerel. Okay.
Jessica was beautiful. And you thought Kwame was...
good, okay, great?
he was good. He did a very good job.
I just think he relied on Troy too much. Troy did a great job
that's not bad if Troy is good. Do you think Troy is better than Kwame?
no. I mean, no offense.
I mean, I just think Kwame did a very good job, an excellent job.
why did he rely on Troy too much? - They have a very tight bond between them.
I guess the trust was there. So I respect that.
what about Kwame? 'Cause I don't care about you. You've been fired.
what about Kwame? Do you love Kwame?
he does. He does. He's in love with him.
okay. What about Bill? How did he do? - He did a good job. He got it done.
what do you think? - He did a great job.
what do you think? Great job.
Carolyn, what do you think? Go ahead. - Overall, he had three days...to put on a celebrity golf outing in three days.
I think Bill was exceptional. - Okay. George?
I think that Kwame and his team did an exceptional job.
I think they were dealing under very difficult circumstances.
what were the circumstances? Circumstances is I've been involved in celebrity golf tournaments.
you tell the celebrities where to be, at what time, and they're there because that's the way the tournament runs.
I disagree. - When you run into a situation...where a star changes the timing, everything else goes wacky.
[ trump ] You disagree also? - Absolutely. 100% I disagree.
[ trump ] You think the golf tournament is tougher. - This is what makes horse racing.
I disagree. - Come on.
listen, enough of this. Go ahead. Let's talk about our golf tournament.
did Bill do anything wrong?
I think Bill, overall, did not perform...at his typical Bill performance.
I think that he had a little bit of a frenzied state.
I think his performance was spectacular.
he looked pretty cool. He looked pretty cool. The results were spectacular.
because I know Bill well, and I know how he usually performs, which is at 110%, I think that he was not...as calm, cool and collected as he usually is.
so he was good by other standards, but not great by his standards.
correct. - What do you think?
there were some areas of opportunity where he could've improved.
or just being calm, even though things were going wrong.
you didn't think he was calm? - He seemed a little ruffled at times.
ifhe delegates something, hejust needs to trust his people.
do you think he's got great potential? - Oh, he's outstanding.
he's a sharp, sharp guy, and I believe, if I were you, I'd select him.
what ruffled him? - Specifically, the challenges coming at him.
you say he was ruffled, and Amy said the same thing about that.
some lost posters that we were searching for.
I think Bill has unbelievable potential, and I think he's a great candidate for this job.
But? - I tend to agree with the two of them.
I just think that Bill has to show more confidence.
other than that, I think he's a fabulous individual.
okay. Go ahead. Let's go. Kwame.
we had quite the opposite experience with Kwame.
Kwame's so cool. At times, I thought he was a bit aloof.
his intensity, when things did go wrong, we didn't see it, and we may have needed to see that... Yeah.
so that we could react appropriately. [ Trump ] You didn't see intensity?
or there was too much intensity? - He was too laid-back.
there were times when he needed to be a little more hands-on. - He is laid-back.
does Kwame have the intensity, Heidi?
I think he has the intensity, but I do like to be micromanaged.
I would have liked to be managed a little bit more.
there was a time where we actually lostJessica Simpson.
shejust cut off all communication with us.
I thought he should've been on it and following that particular scenario.
he's like, " Okay, we'll just deal with it, " and he moved on to the next thing.
is he too laid-back? Kwame lost a lot.
but he's ready. He's got the formula to success.
he's got all the foundations to be a true apprentice.
but if you were to act as three employees of Kwame, you would perhaps like to see him have his feathers ruffled a little bit.
what you're telling me is you'd actually like to see that, I agree with that.
because maybe you needed to see that. - I'd agree with that.
let me just ask a question. Have any of you put in your mind...
what must be going through Donald Trump's mind hiring somebody to do...
the job that he wants done-- a major position in a division?
we're talking about somebody that has the ability to build into a long-term career.
then that's Kwame, hands down. And I'm talking
okay, George. Let me ask you this.
who would you choose if you were me? - Kwame.
who would you choose? - Kwame. - Kwame.
let me guess. Bill, Bill and Bill.
Absolutely. All right. Get out of here. You haven't helped me at all.
get out.
[ trump ] Tough decision, folks. This is a tough decision.
Robin, have them come in, please.
okay, Mr. Trump. You guys can go in now.
you know, you have 215, 000 people. We're down to two.
right. So you're both outstanding, obviously.
but only one of you is going to run one of my companies.
and from what I can gather from your teammates, you both have very contrasting ways of doing business.
bill, what do you think is the easier job? The golf tournament orJessica Simpson?
probably Jessica Simpson. Kwame, what do you think?
I think the golf tournament was definitely easier. - Now, intensity, drive.
a couple of your people wondered whether or not you had the drive or the intensity.
and you'd be surprised at who it was that said it.
what do you think of that? - I tend to be calm, cool and collected.
I'm not someone who gets ruffled easily.
I'm not someone who wears my enthusiasm, my energy on my sleeve.
I am someone who's more focused, more determined.
you know what they say: " Still waters run deep. " - What did you think of your teammates?
did anyone give you a hard time? - Yeah.
who was it? - Omarosa was difficult to manage.
but didn't she wanna be you? She wanted to take your place.
she tried to be out in front of the spotlight. That's not my normal tendency.
I, basically, would rather be the puppet master, pulling strings from behind.
I was surprised when you picked her early on.
you could've picked other people that would have been
you did pick her. Yeah, I did pick her.
not only did he pick her, he picked her very early.
I felt like she was the next most qualified person.
[ trump ] Do you think you made a mistake? - In some ways, yes. In some ways, no.
isn't that risky, considering the time that you're at? This is it.
it doesn't go any further than this. It is a risk
that was a very risky choice. - [ Trump ] George, what do you have?
[ george ] From dealing with your people, they felt...the task that you had required a lot more micromanagement than you gave it.
in other words, when something's going wrong, if the leader doesn't get up and straighten it out...
or doesn't indicate that it's going wrong, then you're not really leading.
all right. Carolyn, what do you have to say?
overall, I think the tournament was a success.
I question what your team said about you, because they actually made a suggestion that perhaps you...appeared a little too stressful and your feathers were ruffled.
not at all. I'm very intense, and I realized the importance...of being successful in the golf outing.
there were a few glitches that came along the way, but I don't think there were many.
I blueprinted a plan that was, you know, pretty all-encompassing of any possible scenario that could go wrong.
we felt like we covered all the bases.
they were saying that you got a little bit flustered under certain circumstances.
[ scoffs ] I mean, I disagree. I didn't at all.
I operate in that environment on a regular basis, where it's high-pressure, very fast.
I'm a perfectionist, and I definitely thought out...every possible glitch along the way.
there were a couple that may have been overlooked, but not many.
do you think you're better than Kwame? -I think I bring different skills to the table.
I've got much more-- Do you think you're better than Kwame?
in a role like this, yes, I do. - Why?
because I've got experience. I've proven myself time and time again.
I have desire, and I think I've exhibited the desire that I have to get this job over the last 13 weeks.
and you've had a good track record. - I've had a very good track record.
I don't think his track record is much better than mine in terms of actual task performance.
he had maybe two or three more wins. - That's a lot.
I am here, and I've performed, and I think you feel confident that I can run one of your companies one day.
do you think over a 30-year period you're gonna be a more successful guy than Bill?
I think it's gonna be neck and neck.
that's not so good. What do you think? Do you think you'll be more successful?
I think I definitely have a leg up. - Why?
I think my entrepreneurial blood that I have in my veins-- I'm more versatile.
education is great, and you've worked your tail off to get that.
but I don't go on pedigree. When you're out there starting from nothing...and you actually do it, it means a lot more.
Kwame, do you think you're gonna do a betterjob for me than Bill?
I definitely think I will. - I want the job.
I don't think he's alone. Obviously, I want the job. I gave up a lot to be here.
[ trump ] You gave up a lot. I gave up a lot to be here.
you gave up a hell of a job. - Yeah, a very steady
in a way, it scares me. In fact, you both gave up a hell of a lot to be working for the Donald.
I think you're both very outstanding. I have a very, very tough choice.
get the hell out of here. - Thank you.
gotta fight for it.
[ exhales Forcefully ] Water.
Yeah, I need a little of that.
that was a-- It was good.
I think it was fair. I think it was fair. It's over with.
both men have to articulate why they'd be good and why they want the job.
there's no hard feelings. Put her there. Uh-uh.
not at all. Yeah. Whew.
[ trump ] This is not easy. What do you think, George?
well, as you say, it's a very tough decision. My vote would go with Kwame.
I think he handled himself well under pressure.
I think he can adapt to some very serious circumstances.
I wouldn't hold his track record in the past as much against him at this point...as I've seen him now in, really, the line of fire.
I can honestly see him as a better fit...in the Trump Organization in the long run.
that's my feeling. He's outstanding.
I agree with you. He's an outstanding guy. He's outstanding.
Carolyn? Well, George, I agree with you on Kwame.
however, I disagree with the choice. I would go for Bill.
you agree with him in what way, he's outstanding?
I think Kwame's outstanding, but I do believe he is textbook, where I think Bill is practical.
I actually see him as a better fit in this organization.
the whole golf tournament-- the hiccups were fairly minimal.
I've watched him the whole time. I've seen Kwame the whole time.
I think Kwame is too laid-back, which perhaps could make employees underneath him a little nervous.
bill held it together. He motivated a staff that was unpaid, just fired.
I think he was great, and I think he's a better fit.
you know what that means. You got a divided court. You gotta make the decision.
I know what it means. Robin, let 'em come in.
okay, Mr. Trump. You can go back in the boardroom now.
come on. Sit down. Let's go.
three months have gone by, and to be honest, you two guys have gone through hell.
you've seen it all. You've been in the city-- the Big Apple-- and it's not easy.
it's a beautiful place, but it can be nasty.
but, you know, you're both winners in every sense.
you are two out of 215, 000 job applicants.
that's a record in television history.
you've really been through it. I love you both.
I've gotten to know you so well.
but, you know, Kwame, a couple of things bother me and bother me really big-league.
Omarosa lied to you.
she deceived you, and not only once, but she lied to you twice.
why didn't you fire her?
at that time, I really didn't know that was an option, and I had a job to get done.
I knew I was the CEO but I also had three people that I needed to depend on to get the work done.
so if I would have fired her at that time, basically, I would have had two people to do the job left for three.
why didn't you move her over to the side? She deceived you.
I tried to move her over to the side in some roles, but, basically,
Troy was running one part of the organization and Heidi was running another.
so I didn't think, at that time, I really could manage both and move her over to the place she needed to be.
it just didn't seem to me and to George and to Carolyn...that you took a tough enough stand.
when somebody deceives you, you have to do something.
I don't like just moving them over.
I like firing them, and you should have fired her.
bill, your job at the golf course, I thought, was really good.
you were a little nervous, a little crazy, but you got the job done.
I've had a lot of golf tournaments. I've run a lot of golf tournaments.
Carolyn's run more than me.
and we both agree you did a really good job at that golf tournament.
I think you have an amazing future.
you're a brilliant guy, a great education, and I have no doubt that you're gonna be a big success.
but for right now, Bill, you're hired.
all right. Settle down. [ Stops ]
settle down.
we've still got some business to take care of.
and you look very happy.
you knew you were gonna get a great job, and here's your first big decision.
bill, you get to choose between overseeing operations...at two fabulous locations in my organization.
the first, a spectacular building project in Chicago.
[ trump ] Soon it will stand tall among the world's greatest towers.
it'll be a shimmering jewel in the Chicago skyline.
this summer, I plan to begin building the 90-story Trump International Hotel and Tower...
on the site presently occupied by the low-rise headquarters...of the Chicago Sun-Times.
with 2, 500 skilled craftsmen, a fleet of construction equipment...
and $ 700 million,
I intend to erect a modern masterpiece of steel and glass
a five-star hotel and residential building...with exclusive condominiums and super-luxury hotel units.
it'll be a mind-boggling job to manage.
when it's finished in 2007, the Trump International Hotel and Tower, Chicago...
could have a value of $ 1. 2 billion...
and will raise the standards of architectural excellence throughout the world.
that is one terrific 90-story building.
and next, an equally incredible golf course...
on the edge of the Pacific Ocean in Los Angeles, California.
take a look.
[ trump ] The Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles is a spectacular 300-acre resort...overlooking a breathtaking stretch of the Pacific Ocean.
I bought it about a year ago after the 18th hole slid into the ocean, and some experts claimed it was beyond repair.
however, no task is too big for me.
I assembled an army of 350 workers and 50 trucks...
and hauled in 1. 7 million cubic yards of earth...
at a cost of over $200 million...
to create the most expensive golf course ever built.
and to top it off, I'm planning a five-star clubhouse...
and a premiere residential development with 75 custom-designed estates...
that will sell for between $5 million and $ 15 million.
managing this property is a huge undertaking.
when it opens in August, Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles...will be one of the greatest golf courses and clubs anywhere in the world, even superior to Pebble Beach.
so? Not bad.
that's not bad. Two great options.
you'd better do a good job for me. [ Chuckles ] Whoo.
in the world of big business, decisions need to be made quickly.
you're gonna find that out.
you've got just a couple of minutes to decide which job you want.
we'll also get some answers that everyone wants to know about.
what about Nick and Amy? How is Sam doing?
and the person who stirred things up more than anybody, Omarosa.
what's up with her? We'll be right back.
okay, Bill, you've seen the two job choices
a spectacular California golf course...
with top-of-the-line mansions on the Pacific Ocean...
or a great Chicago hotel and residential tower...
that will redefine the Chicago skyline.
you've had three minutes-- plenty of time to make a decision.
[ audience Laughing ] Which is it?
well, Mr. Trump, California has wonderful weather, and it's a great opportunity, but Chicago's where I'm from, and to me, it's the best place in the world, so
Chicago it is.
it's gonna be a beautiful building.
don't worry. You're gonna have plenty of supervision on that building.
I don't care if you're president or not. There's gonna be a lot of supervision. [ Bill Chuckling ]
I guess I won't be able to rename it. - Believe me, you're gonna have supervision, and I'll be the one supervising.
but it's a great choice. And you're gonna be happy if I'm gonna be happy.
and what the hell are you doing sitting over there?
I fired all those people. Get over here.
it feels good. - Tell me about it.
you'd better do well. I promise.
so how do you feel? This is a great place in the world to be right now.
I'll tell you that. Well, I just wanna let you know...
it wasn't an easy decision, 'cause that man right there is some man. I know.
[ bill ] A fierce competitor. Thank you. Thank you.
[ audience Cheering, Applauding ] A fierce competitor.
he is.
he's a competitor, and he's a fine guy. Kwame, I wanna congratulate you, 'cause, believe me, it was right up until the end. Thank you.
and, you know, just one of those things.
let's talk to some of the folks in the audience, in the group.
Omarosa, you've been so controversial. [ Omarosa Chuckling ]
you've been so controversial. Mr. Trump, you start out with me?
I've always gotten along so well with you. But you really got caught on tape this time.
I mean, you were right on camera. You got caught in a couple ofbeauties.
how do you explain that? - Mr. Trump, first of all, let me just say
I need to get this clear first. You should just hire me, then fire me, rehire me and then fire me again?
it's a little confusing. - You have too many excuses.
enough with the excuses. Heidi, what do you think? Excuses
tell me. What do you think? Wait a minute. Omarosa, please. First of all, I
what do you think? - [ Audience Cheering, Applauding ]
what do you think? [ Heidi ] Honestly, I think Omarosa and I...should go out for a nice two-hour lunch to discuss it.
you know, Ereka, probably more than any of the 16 contestants, you really suffered, because charges were made against you that were very, very tough.
I mean, how can you respond to it?
Mr. Trump, I would have fired her, and I would have liked it.
she's a liar, and I've known that for a long time.
well, I think you suffered a lot, and I hope everything's fine. - Thank you.
and, Omarosa, I hope everything's fine with you. Thanks, Mr. Trump.
it will be. It will be. Really. I'm sure it will be. I hope so.
but you gotta straighten out the truth, in all fairness, okay? Oh, yeah. We will.
we will. All right. Nick and Amy.
this is the weakest romance I've ever seen.
[ audience Laughing ] This romance is pathetic.
was there a romance? I mean, give us the scoop.
we dated briefly after the show.
and then-- It wasn't very hot.
no, it wasn't. There was no heat.
the most we saw was a little kiss from Amy to you.
that's right. That's right. That's all there was.
that's not m-- Well, that's good, Amy. Good virtue.
so there was nothing. So are you together now?
no, we're not together.
who broke up with who? I wanna know.
Amy, why don't you answer that question? I've always loved this guy.
I think we just decided we were meant to be very close friends.
very close friends. That's right. Good. I've had some very close friends.
me too. - [ Audience Laughing ]
me too. [ Laughing ] It's cost me a lot of money, I'll tell you that.
you know, there's a guy in the room named Troy, who everybody loves.
everybody loves. What do you have to say, Troy?
I think that the opportunity that you and Mr. Burnett gave me...was an opportunity of a lifetime.
you know, 15 years ago, when I said I was comin' to meet you,
I was so proud to look my mama and my family in the face...
to say, " I accomplished my goal. "
it was an honor to meet you, and I'm comin' back.
well, you can come back.
you really could come back.
you know, there are two other people, and they really have worked hard.
we call her Lady Di. She looks like Lady Di to me.
and George. And George
[ audience Cheering, Applauding ] [ Man ] All right, George.
I've always said about those two, they're two tough, smart people, but they have big hearts.
they're good people, and you did a great job, and I appreciate it.
I appreciate it. [ No Audible Dialogue ]
this could really go on for a long time-- hours
but we've got some other important business to take care of.
bill, right now, you're feeling pretty good, right, my man?
I think that's safe to say. You'd better be feeling pretty good.
well, here's something to make you feel just a little bit better
a brand-new Chrysler Crossfire.
it's a really beautiful car, and you're gonna love driving it.
and I wanna further thank Chrysler for being such a great sponsor, and people like George Steinbrenner, a friend of mine, who did the show long before anyone knew it was gonna be a big hit.
he was out there, and Chrysler was out there, and I wanna thank them.
a new Apprentice is about to start.
we've got a sneak preview as soon as we get back.
so just stay tuned. Thank you.
you wanna shake my hand? I wanna shake your hand.
they're a little sweaty. Okay, give me your hand.
that was one of the biggest moments of my life, shaking that man's hand.
he is my mentor. - He just shook my hand! My sweaty hand!
Sam, you're a piece of work. [ Audience Chuckling ]
so let me ask you. How are you doing? I'm doing well.
we're gonna see how I'm doing. I'm putting it all on the line, Mr. Trump.
I think you're gonna do great. I've always said that. I'm putting it all on the line.
I'll tell you what. I got a proposition for you in my Samsonite briefcase. Go ahead. Give me money.
you're paying Bill here $250, 000 to work for you next year. - [ Locks Clicking ]
I'll pay you $250, 000 to work for you. Give me that money. Give me that money.
I'm dead serious. Bring it over.
it's real. -Bring it over. Bring it over.
if that's real money, I'll take it. It's real.
okay? Is it real? I'll take it. - It's real. I want the job.
I'll put him to work for 10, 000 a year, and that's pretty good.
it's an investment in my future. Come on. Give it over. I might take it.
come on. Let's go. Here you go.
okay. It's for you. It's a nice briefcase too.
that looks like the real deal. All right.
I'm gonna seriously consider that.
I've told a lot of people he's a different kind of guy.
I'm not crazy. And now, we've just
it's not such a crazy thing hejust did, folks.
anyway.
Heidi, how is your mother?
my mom is doing great. She's here tonight?
Yeah. My mom's over there. - Where's your mother?
give my mom a big hand. Hi.
you have a lovely daughter, who, believe me I mean, she was cut a little bit short because she was very worried about you. Aw.
[ Heidi ] Thank you. I just want you to know that.
and, Tammy, you're gonna have a baby. Ah! - Yeah!
my husband and I-- How's my real estate man doing in the back?
my Detroit real estate man. He's taking over the city of Detroit.
how are you doing? Coming along. I've actually doubled my empire.
you've motivated me to get on your heels.
so, a lot of things happening.
he's able to collect his rent now. And you've all had some really
what's that? He's able to collect his rent finally.
well, that's good. That's good. You've all had some really good job offers, I understand.
I mean, you've had many job offers. Is that true? [ Man ] Absolutely. Oh, yeah.
that's terrific. That's terrific. Well, I hope you take advantage of it.
okay. Bill, congratulations again.
you start work for the Trump Organization soon, like maybe tomorrow. Okay?
we're not gonna give you a lot of time.
so you be on time. And in the meantime, here are the keys and all.
I want you to go down there right now. Go down to the street.
you get in that car and drive away for about 15 minutes, and then you get over to Trump Tower, and you start working.
okay? Okay. Will do. Will do.
thank you. Thank you again. [ Audience Cheering, Applauding ]
thank you.
see ya. Take care. Whoops.
sorry, George. Thank you. Good luck.
and here is the first ever look at what's ahead...when an all-new Apprentice returns to NBC this fall.
[ trump ] Soon, 16 new candidates will come to New York City...
and compete for the dream job of a lifetime.
but this go-around I've raised the stakes even higher.
today, expectations in corporate America are more demanding than ever, and so am I.
the candidates will face tougher tasks with tighter deadlines.
this time, they'll work with some of the world's largest Fortune 500 companies.
and who knows, maybe I'll even bring back some familiar faces.
who will succeed? Who will fail?
who will be... the apprentice?
congratulations again to our big winner, Bill Rancic.
this has been an incredible experience for the contestants...as well as for George, Carolyn and myself.
good luck to you all. Thanks for watching. And good night.
tonight begins a season of "the apprentice" like never before.
this time on "the apprentice,
I've issued a challenge to 14 of the world's most successful celebrities to prove that they have what it takes to make it big in world.
how u doin'? It's good to see y'all.
ars that have made thk beyond the spotlight...
heavyweight boxing champion Leox Lewis...
playmate of the year Tiffany Fallon...
ultimate fighter and sportswear mogul Tito Ortiz...
that was an old-school beat down right there.
star of "taxi" and best-selling author Marilu Henner...
multiplatinum country star Trace Adkins...
trace: I don't think I've been any more apprehensive about anything I've ever done.
"the apprehensive apprentice," that's me.
notorious tabloid journalist and judge of "america's got talent," Piers Morgan.
you called me a fat italian.
I didn't call you "fat." - What did you call him?
I called him a very fat italian.
marketing genius and kiss legend Gene Simmons...
it's aptly named "show business" -- "the business of show.
softball gold medalist Jennie Finch...
come on, boy!
actor, author, and entrepreneur Stephen Baldwin...
that's beautiful. Perfect.
television executive and latina media tycoon Nely Gain...
Oh, I love that shot.
the original supermodel and health pioneer Carol Alt...
I'm not cowering at all. Don't you ever say that to me.
"sopranos" star and broadway headliner Vincent Pastore...
am I gonna get whacked for this?
I've been whacked before, and I'm still around.
5-time olympic gold medalist Nadia Comaneci...
and just when you thought it was safe to go back into the boardroom, Omarosa.
what's your name? - Omarosa.
sorry, I know you're a celebrity. I just never heard of you.
14 celebrities, 14 egos, and more drama than even they can handle.
get over here!
that arrogant English bastard just -- - you're in a place of business, - and we're representing a company that -- - I'm tired of it, Stephen!
gone are their agents.
where is the producer?
gone are their managers.
I don't want the cameras on.
Oh, don't tell me that.
gone are their assistants.
you know how to do computer - Nope.
just step right up, ladies and gentlemen.
this time, the battle is to raise millions for the charity of their choice.
daddy! Daddy!
it reminded me why I'm doing this -- for that 6-year-old.
my brother passed away last year, and this charity is in memory of him.
hundreds of thousands of dollars would put this charity on the map.
I present this check to you.
are you kidding? $50, 000?
Oh, my gosh!
to win this game, they'll have to rely on their wits...
come on!
I need some heavy-hitter people to come down.
and their celebrity rolodex.
I just wanted to do a drive-by.
call the richest people you know...
I'll pay $1, 000 each.
to bring as much money as they can.
$5, 000 for a water!
richard branson just called me. He's giving us $10, 000.
but no matter how famous they think they are, every week one celebrity will be hearing those dreaded words...
you're fired.
welcome to the new york mercantile exchange, the world's largest commodity exchange.
now, we're all commodities. I'm a commodity.
Lennox, you're a commodity, a fighting machine who really took it to a new level.
you're a commodity, Trace, whether we like it or not.
So,"commodity" is why I handpicked each one of you to take part in "the celebrity apprentice."
now, instead of playing for a job, this time you're playing for charity, your favorite charity.
I am here at "the apprentice" because I have a wonderful charity that I'm playing for, which is the Walter Reed Society, which help and assist wounded heroes that come back from combat.
Trump: In the end, all but one of you will be fired.
only one of you will become the celebrity apprentice.
now, you are going to be divided male versus female.
you're going back to the Trump tower.
you're going to set up a team name.
you're going to also choose, very importantly, a project manager.
and, Mr. Trump, I'm gonna go on record now and say that I'd like to be the first project manager.
okay, but you're gonna have to convince your teammates 'cause maybe they don't want you.
nobody likes you but me, Omarosa, so maybe they're not gonna like you!
Hey, that's all that counts is that you like me.
okay, that is all that counts, actually.
in this game, that's all that counts, I have to tell you.
Omarosa. What's her name? "Omarosa," "ponderosa"?
whatever her name is, nobody knows who she is.
so, forget about her.
so, go back. I'll see you in a little while in the boardroom. Thank you.
well, I just thought I'd come prepared 'cause you know I'm a prepared person.
I brought props. Try it on.
I wanted hats that would make us look good. See, I brought.
I already feel smarter.
I brought us props because sometimes you want to have hats, you want to have things that sort of show team unity, and to brand us together.
I'm a big brander. I'm into branding.
we can have a -- that way when we come in or we can make something else out of it. - When Nely started pulling out those props, I thought, "oh, I'm going to lose my mind."
I mean, I love the hats, but if we could just focus on a name. Okay.
this is not some dress-up tea party.
this is "the apprentice." Get with it.
carol: How 'bout, like, powerful names?
I want a powerful name. - Like "mega" or "explosion" or something.
is there a word for, like, a powerful woman?
Yeah,"Omarosa."
I know a lot of people like Omarosa.
she definitely wants to prove to all of us that she's got a little more power, a little more knowledge than the rest of us.
look up "dominance.
"Charisma," you know,"talent."
"dynamism." "Dynamisms"?
we were just throwing ideas left and right, which I love about this group.
everyone's very active and loved to participate.
what's a spanish word for "expert"? - "Experto."
Empresario. - "Empresario."
I love that word.
Empresario's good!
and it works in multiple languages.
an empresario is someone who creates a business and is really a mogul.
it's another word for a mogul.
who likes "empresario"? Raise their hand.
there it is.
okay, what about that name?
gentlemen, anybody have a name? - "The champions."
no, you want something that sounds corporate.
what about "the bada bing boys"?
Mr. Trump gave us the orders this morning to come up with a name for our team.
and we have a secret weapon, and his name is Gene Simmons.
what about something that's got a mythic quality?
something like "hydra"?
hydra was, I think, the three-headed dog that guarded the gateway to hell.
No，that was my ex-wife.
I am very curious about what donald is going to have us do because I watched every "apprentice," every episode, and the game sometimes took a toll on people.
so I can't imagine that he would put celebrities through that, although, you know, maybe.
team hydra.
team empresario. Did I get that right?
okay, my daughter Ivanka and my son Donald Jr.
will be assisting me during this process.
it looks like Stephen and Omara have stepped up as project managers.
Omarosa, do you know Stephen?
Rtunately, I do.
wow, not very nice. Stephen, you know Omarosa?
of course. I think she's delightful.
very good. I hope you say that in two weeks from now.
now, the restaurant business is a $10 billion-a-year industry in New York city.
now, a little section of that business, but also a big business, is the hot-dog business in New York.
so, you're going to be selling hot dogs, and the team that makes the most money wins.
a hot dog in New York goes for about a dollar, maybe a little bit more.
you're big celebrities.
you should be able to do an unbelievable business in selling for a lot higher price than that.
and don't forget, you're working for charity.
the team that doesn't sell as much is going to lose a celebrity.
a celebrity will be fired.
now, let me tell you, I'm in the real-estate business.
real estate, to a large extent, is about location.
selling hot dogs is about location.
so, pick the right location. Good luck. Go.
thank you.
after you. - Stephen, good luck.
I won't need it. - Oh, you will.
empresario teammates. I love that name.
did y'all hear their name? It sucked.
Hydra"? What in god's name were they thinking?
I feel very confident in my leadership skills.
I don't want to go in that boardroom.
I'm telling you, I don't want to go in that boardroom, so we've got to bring a win home.
Carol, our first order of business is location, and you're our new yorker.
okay, the first place I think of -- 34th and 7th.
it's just north of penn station, so you've got madison square garden there, and you have a post office one block over.
carol: I'm the only new yorker in the group.
I picked the location right by the subway, right by penn station, where every businessman in New York city comes out.
and I'm confident that we should win this one.
okay, ladies, we've come up with a consensus.
let's get location first.
location's key. - Yeah.
we need to choose a place where the big money is.
radio city.
rockefeller center.
rockefeller center is radio city. - Right.
same place. - Okay.
I've never actually had a hot-dog cart.
but if you get the right location, you can make a buck.
let's talk about the big idea.
Marilu: So, how would you suggest that we get to use all of our celebrity, et cetera?
I probably wouldn't go with that.
we need to build it on solid business concepts as opposed to celebrity.
it's called "celebrity apprentice," and selling celebrity is what always works.
people know what a hot dog looks like.
but this is the way she wants to run with it, so here we go.
why are you looking at me like that?
the average person that's going up to get this hot dog, the thing that's gonna attract them to our cart is the fact that there's some beautiful women selling it.
take that approach, that,"who cares about the product?"
no, I do care about the product!
now that I'm managing this product, we don't bank on the celebrity.
we bank on solid sales skills.
Tiffany: We had some really negative energy in the room.
I just don't work well with people that are condescending and abrasive.
it doesn't want to make you work harder at anything.
fine.
then that's the decision that's made.
I'm glad you're picking up what I'm putting down.
what do we do as promotion?
people are gonna want to take pictures with us.
no, we don't allow that.
if they give us $25, we'll allow it.
okay, yeah, we'll allow it then.
and by the way, they're paying $100, 'cause they get a picture with Lennox Lewis and an autograph.
I'm willing to take a picture with somebody and sell them a hot dog for $25.
well, then, we're gonna lose.
we're not gonna lose. We're gonna do volume.
Vinny, the commodity is the most valuable to this. It's not the food and drink.
it's the celebrities, right?
we've got big, big stars.
the chance to photo Lennox, you know, we can charge $100 for a hot dog.
if we sell ourselves short, we might get beat.
okay, but hold on a second.
you have to have people who have $100 in cash in their pocket.
nobody in New York has $100 in their pocket?
do me a favor! It's the richest city in the world.
or so you all keep telling me.
I'm gonna recommend.
Bob, it's Gene Simmons. Would you do me a favor?
I'd like you to show up and buy a $5, 000 hot dog.
all of the money goes to charity. Will you do that for me?
tomorrow.
thank you, Bob.
this is what we need, right?
we can make more money -- - by just.
get out of the dollar hot-dog business.
I want to know if you will buy an expensive hot dog for charity.
and I need your help because I know you're a big man with a big heart.
trace: It's fun to listen to Gene do his thing, you know?
he's got numbers of very wealthy, powerful people.
and we're tapping into that.
will you guys hop on a plane and put a check in our hands on the streets of new york?
we're gonna crush 'em. There's no doubt in my mind.
we're doing well. We got some money.
it's not in yet.
that's right.
come on, guys. Let's go!
everybody, stop one second.
quarterback's got to talk. Ready?
huddle up, guys, quick.
don't break up, guys. Don't break up.
we jeopardize the whole thing.
empresario 21/2 Hours Remaining
let's put the signs down. Let's get ourselves ready.
are the hot dogs prepared? Are the buns ready? - Yes.
ladies, we are in business.
okay, here you go!
we decided to go with an all-american theme.
white t-shirts, some sexy jeans, and a red cap. Red, white, and blue.
we were all-american girls selling the all-american food, the hot dog.
let's go! Big hot dogs! The best in the city!
Oh, thank you so much! First customer! Our first customer!
$5! I appreciate you.
we started out selling the hot dogs for $5.
pretty quickly, we started thinking,"okay, well, maybe we can ask for more money."
okay, how 'bout $10? Okay, thank you!
you're giving me $20 for the hot dog?
this is the most I've gotten. - Oh, get out of here!
when we saw that we could get $20, then we started trying to get $100.
$100! Come over and get your hot dog!
this gentleman is buying a hot dog for $500.
thank you so much.
Nely: We gave thanks to people that only had $1 or $2.
but the people that really had a lot to give, we, like, dug it out of them.
like major money. We have major money.
I'm a rock star.
Omarosa: Oh, god!
ladies, Mr. Trump is here. Be calm, cool, and professional.
this is our great mayor. - Oh, my gosh!
mayor Bloomberg and Nald Trump paid a visit. It was the highlight of this task for me.
he's gonna test one.
as the number-one "frankophile" in the city,
I'm supposed to see whether you guys can cut the mustard.
all right, then.
very good.
I can't tell whether these are better or worse than the ones the men were selling until I have a hot dog with the men.
I can tell you this without seeing the men -- you guys look better.
hydra 2 Hours Remaining - We got a lot of dogs here! - Oh, no.
Oh, yes. - Oh, no.
Oh, yes. - That's terrible.
get a celebrity hot dog! Meet Lennox Lewis!
come on, guys, don't get a free picture! Go and get one for charity!
that's not enough.
go to $10, and I'll think about it.
$10? - Yes!
you get a picture with Lennox Lewis.
you give me $15, you take $20. You still make $5.
that doesn't matter. Give me $20. Come on.
we'll talk about the $20 another time. You want to take $5 right now?
sir, you don't really want change out of my bag, do you?
don't be so embarrassing.
$4? You're not getting a hot dog for $4.
the reason I'm so keen to charge a premium price for the hot dogs is to get a load of money in if gene's guys don't turn up.
gene's talking a great game, but if his people don't turn up, it is a disaster.
okay, how much you got?
I got $5? - No. More.
some ones? - We need more.
okay, I can't deal with the minutia.
if they show up, cool. If not, there's nothing I can do.

celebrity hot dogs for charity, baby! Let's go!
what are we doing, adie 100 bucks! $100!
I knew we'd get $100 off the people of New York.
Tito: It was shaky in the very beginning, buit going very well.
I don't think anybody in the world sells hot dogs as quick as we have.
hot dogs for charity!
we got about another hour left.
the lunch crowd just started coming in.
everybody's working in unison.
the team's coming together great.
team Hydra, baby. Hot dogs for charity.
now, how much you got? - We've got $100.
thank you very much! $100!
go through and get your picture with whoever you'd like, okay?
I got a dog comin' at ya.
$100! $100!
Lennox: Because New York is such a melting pot, you know, there's country-music people walking by, kiss fans walking by, ufc fans walking by, so, you know, we had a real mixture.
this is -- this is getting crazy.
Piers: Meet Donald Trump, everybody!
meet the mayor of New York, mayor Bloomberg!
Hey, mayor bloomberg, how are you, sir?
very nice of you gentlemen to come by.
uh, the question is, is this the best hot dog?
or is the best hot dog sold by all of those gorgus women at the last hot-dog stand?
very good.
and I'll bet he'll never reveal the answer.
and that's why you're the mayor of new york. There you go.

hot dogs!
just give me two with mustard and kraut.
kraut and mustard.
come on, guys! You want a hot dog?
how can you turn down Tiffany Fallon, playmate of the year?
hot dog, chips, water, drinks.
selling hot dogs.
Tiff's not selling the way she needs to.
Tiffany, can you float out a little? We just got people standing there.
just walk up and pull them in.
Omarosa: Tiffany, for somebody that's selling ass in magazines, sure couldn't sell a hot dog to save her life.
I couldn't get her to go out there and sell and sell and sell.
$13?
we got hot dogs, baby! Ready-to-go hot dogs!
one hot dog for $5? - Yeah.
you're gonna get a water for $5?
the girls are doing better.
they got to upsell though.
we've gotten a lot of cash. We've gotten a few big ones. But we need more.
it just doesn't feel like enough.
Omarosa didn't want to focus on celebrity...
the southeast corner. Okay?
but I figured I'd better hop on the phone and call the contacts that I have.
Marllu's Contact
so, you want to get a hot dog? We have a high-roller table.
a high-roller table? I'm in.
you're in. I figured.
I figured that appealed to you.
so, what do you think? The boy -- what's this?
what? That's cash.
but how much is this?
well, it says right there,"$5, 000."
$5, 000! Oh, my gosh!
$5, 000 for a water!
are you kidding me? Oh, my god!
no, another $5, 000? - Another $5, 000.
thank you so much. A bottle of water.
I love you, Marilu.
thank you so much. Thank you so .

$10, 000, ladies and gentlemen, for a hot dog!

we have a $5, 000 hot dog fan!

it is the vacuum-cleaner salesman that sells the vacuum cleaner.
I'm the salesman, baby.

$5, 000, this man is giving us!
in cash, ladies and gentlemen!
we did pretty well. I mean, it seemed to be loads of money coming in.
but what I keep thinking,"if the girls have got one very rich donator "who turns up and gives them $100, 000, we're wiped away.
I don't like that feeling.

guys, we have David Wright here in the house.
Omarosa, David Wright.
hello. - My gosh.
you're a friend of Jennie's?
david Wright is the third baseman for the New York mets.
I was thinking of big baseball players, and who's bigger in New York than David Wright?
so I was super excited about coming across his number and hoping that he would come out and visit us.
okay, how 'bout we'll make a nice donation, and the next however many people come up -- free hot dogs?
okay. David Wright would like to treat.
he would like to make a donation and then just treat.
that would be great 'cause we only have 10 minutes left. - Okay.
free hot dogs!
he just bought our cart out.
david Wright bought out the cart of hot dogs and started handing them out.
thanks to David Wright.
how incredible was that?
we're all out of hot dogs!
y'all did so well.
put it in the pot.
1, 2,3, win!
give me an "e"!
welcome to your first boardroom.
mayor Bloomberg had a great time. He liked both frankfurters.
but, ultimately, it's how much you sold that counts.
Omarosa, how do you think your team did?
I think we did outstanding.
you think you won? - I would hope so.
why do you think you won?
well, we had a great plan, and I think that we executed it in a very effective way.
Stephen, how did Hydra do?
beyond my expectations.
I really give the credit to all the other players.
Tito Ortiz brought his significant other, Jenna Jameson, and that was fun.
well, that will get the crowds, Tito, won't it? - Of course.
you gonna marry her, Tito? You gonna get a prenup, prenup? Remember that prenup.
happiness is without marriage at this time.
so, you know, why put the pressure on each other?
you're right about that.
so, let's hear the results.
don, how did empresario do?
well, Empresario sold a total of $17, 038. 79 worth of hot dogs.
hold up, guys. Hold up, guys. You better hold up because you don't know. Ivanka?
hydra, largely through large donations, you raised a total of $52, 286.
that's a drubbing.
Congratulations. - Thank you.
that's a drubbing.
I concede to defeat.
but just an observation that I have.
I really thought the men were using their celebrity better than the women.
I also liked their location much better, much more action.
how do you feel about that, Stephen?
Mr. Trump, kudos to Mr. Simmons.
very impressive in his ability to contact donors, et cetera, et cetera.
if we had to do it over, I wouldn't change a thing.
Piers, let me ask you this question.
who would you say is the least impressive person on the other side?
we immediately identified their weak link as being "Amarosa."
Omarosa," Piers. If you're gonna say my name, say it right.
what's your name? - Omarosa.
sorry, I know you're a celebrity. I just never heard of you.
so, Omarosa -- - and you think Americans have known about you?
well, okay, whatever. Omarosa, we identified as the weak link because I've seen her work on the previous series of "apprentice," and she's just trouble.
and I've seen your work on that show -- I can't remember the name of it.
and you haven't been impressive either. - Okay.
in fact, they call you "the british ass."
it's the number-one show in america in the summer. I'm happy with that.
you have one of the most beautiful athletes ever, a playboy centerfold, and one of the best supermodels of all time.
so, I learned that lesson from the first season, and I balanced that with what my marketing team wanted to implement in this particular task.
but they killed you, Omarosa.
now, the combined earnings from both teams in this task was $69, 324, an "apprentice" all-time record.
I'm gonna give you a little surprise, Stephen.
all the money that was raised is all going to go to your charity.
Congratulations.
and, obviously, that's because you're the team leader.
and we are going to do that over the coming weeks.
when the project manager wins, you take the risk, you take all of the negatives, but you also take the positives.
what's the name of the charity?
on behalf of my mother, it's the carol M. Baldwin breast cancer research fund.
way, I've met her. She's a terrific woman.
thank you. She is.
congratulations, hydra.
it's time to celebrate.
and you'll be able to watch everything going on in here from the comfort of your war room.
you just watch, if you want.
but go back to the room.
Oh, we want to watch.
you'll be watching. You'll be watching.
ladies, stay here. One of you is about to be fired.
who knows how to turn the tv on?
let's watch.
Omarosa, what happened?
we had a plan.
the implementation wasn't as strong.
we worked hard, but it just wasn't enough.
were you disappointed with some of the members of your team, or not particularly?
I was disappointed with several of the members, and I was surprised by how other members stepped up.
who stepped up, first of all?
Marilu came in with a sale for $5, 000, and she followed.
so, you did a little bit of what they did?
Yes, I sold two waters, actually, for $5, 000 a piece.
$5, 000 a piece. - A piece.
10000 And a hot dog
Well,$10, 000 is like 60% of what you raised.
and one for $1, 000, a hot dog. - Great job.
she was a rock star today.
who else did a good job?
on the technical side, Nely.
she was solid, she was really focused, and she kept us on task.
well, let me ask you, then, the obvious question -- who did a poor job?
Tiffany, who I think is a great commodity, was not a great salesperson.
a commodity in what way? She's beautiful?
well, she is former playmate of the year.
and I don't know if you mind me saying this, but in that magazine, you're presenting sex.
and you're selling the obvious. You're selling yourself.
and she didn't do that?
no, she didn't.
you were criticized for doing that.
and now you're saying that she should have been selling sex. - Let me make the difference.
here's the difference.
when Lennox was standing out, he was boxing. That's his brand.
when Tito was out there, he's an ultimate fighter. That's his brand.
the bottom line is she's a playmate of the year. That's her brand.
Omarosa's a survivor, like a cockroach.
no matter what you do, you cannot kill her.
she'll do anything to kill the others. This is her own teammates.
unfortunately, when I went to Tiffany over and over again, we needed more energy, we needed more of a push.
she did not deliver. - That's not true.
my first hot dog was 50 bucks.
and at the end of the day, what did you bring in, percent?
I would say over -- - I can tell you it was less than $300.
no, I collected a $200 hot dog. There was no big sale.
and I was disappointed that she did not reach out to her personal network.
I did.
unfortunately, my contacts can't afford to do the $5, 000 donations, which is fine.
but it's the point that we asked.
hugh Hefner can afford it. Did you call him?
no, because I'd like to save him for a different task on a later day.
but there's no guarantee for tomorrow, Tiffany.
you could be fired tonight, and you're saving the biggest contact that you have.
and you could have brought more money in for the charity.
Tiffany, I will say this, you're very beautiful, but you're very low-key in terms of your beauty compared to playmates of the year.
I've known a lot of playmates of the year. - I'm sure you have.
you're not very overstated. And I think that's a nice thing.
I'm not saying that negatively.
we were asked to wear a certain uniform, which I was happy to wear.
but at the same token, we weren't allowed to use our celebrity that often.
allowed to use?
I actually think the uniforms were a terrible mistake.
they just didn't do anything to show who you were.
I mean, you're sitting there, you're hiding behind hats, you've got a big hot dog on your chest.
you were advertising the product,"hot dog," rather than the celebrity, again.
coming from our project manager, Omarosa.
when we said we wanted to do the red carpet, glam, all that kind of thing, she said we want to use the "celebrity-ness" as a cherry on top, not as our selling pitch.
Omarosa, what do you think it was about?
hot dogs or branding or celebrity? What do you think it was about?
it was about getting the largest amount of money you could for one transaction. And I said $1, 000.
let me ask you this, is that about hot dogs or is it about celebrity?
I think it's about celebrity.
so, Nely, what do you think?
Omarosa made a decision.
as it turns out, that decision was probably not the best choice.
however, everything else she did in the entire thing was perfection.
I think it's about leadership.
and Omarosa did display leadership, incredible leadership.
I don't think everyone that's sitting here can honestly tell me that you're ready to be a leader.
but you can't have seven leaders. - Who's not ready to be a leader?
but I tell you one thing, if I was the leader,
I wouldn't be as condescending as Omarosa was.
well, if you weren't so immature, I wouldn't need to be condescending. All you have to do is listen.
Tiffany is toast.
she's a lovely girl, but she's not defended herself properly.
she should have gone on the attack. - She's not a mean chick.
why did you ultimately pick that location?
I thought it was terrible.
we deferred to Carol for the location. - Did you defer to Carol?
no, we did not.
wait, wait, wait. Stop.
because I don't want you to step away from the fact that you took lead on location, did you not?
I didn't take lead. You gave me lead on the location because I was from New York.
you started giving us coaching lessons about New York.
and you were the self-proclaimed new yorker. - I tutored you on the locations.
and now you're cowering from the fact -- - I'm not cowering at all.
don't you ever even say that to me.
what I'm saying to you is I gave you all the information about each of the areas that we chose.
but do you think you gave them the right information about location?
cause you really would know location, like I would know the location better than
what I gave them about 34th and 7th was that is not a good location, in my opinion.
don: Anywhere near penn station, yeah, you can make the $1 sale to the tourist who's coming in to new york maybe around noon, but it's a very poor location.
Omarosa, I want you to pick two people, and then I'm gonna ask everybody to leave, including you and the two people.
and I'm gonna ask you and the two people to come back.
Mr. Trump, my two people, of course, Carol and Tiffany.
everyone leave, and the three of you will come right back.
that's it. We won't see any more now.
Omarosa, Tiffany, Carol. Tiffany's gone.
she may want to take Carol out now...
no, she won't. - Who's more combative.
she needs Carol 'cause Carol knows New York.
those girls have now gone public slagging each other off.
we can disagree in here, but we have not publicly had a go at each other.
and that's a massive advantage, right?
if you thought the first part was fun, wait till you see this part.
it gets better.
Annette, let them come in, please.
so, Omarosa, what do you have to say for yourself?
you know, everybody likes the comfort of being a follower without the discomfort of being a leader.
I stepped up. I took a risk. We lost.
but I take accountability for the plan that I put in place, and I looked to these ladies, to my team, to implement it.
and we just came up short.
what do you think, Carol?
I think I stepped up in every moment that I could.
when there was a void to be filled, I stepped in.
when I disagreed with something, I said so.
but, ultimately, Omarosa was our leader, and I would always defer to her because she was making the ultimate decisions.
you don't like Omarosa very much, do you?
I have nothing against Omarosa.
I have the utmost respect for what she's accomplished on "the apprentice.
however, I just felt that that got in the way a bit.
I think that she was very secure in what she was doing and almost overly secure.
they all loved the fact that I had been on the show.
they tried to exploit me for that and extract information from it.
and now she sits there and says it's a liability.
it ultimately appeared because it's convenient 'cause you're sitting in front of Donald Ttrump.
but the hundred questions you asked me yesterday, I was open, I shared information with you all.
and now you have the audacity to sit here and criticize me for being helpful.
Tiffany, you look a little scared.
you know, you're dealing with two people that are a little older than you, two people that have been through the wars.
you really haven't been through the wars, and I can see that.
do you feel a little nervous or a little scared being with these two?
cause they're pretty intimidating. - Not at all.
and by the way, Carol, I'm very impressed with. She's tough.
and, Omarosa, you have to say that.
she's fighting. - She's fighting.
I've fought for two days, come on.
I think across the board, everyone worked really hard.
at the end of the day, we were mentally and physically exhausted.
am I scared of anybody? Heck no.
I was in the pageant system. - Don't get exhausted.
don't even talk about exhausted.
don't even say you were exhausted. Just forget it.
put it out of your mind. - Well, we worked very physically hard in engaging with these people.
did you undersell relative to the other people on your team?
there's no way of knowing because, as far as Marilu is concerned, she brought in the biggest dollars.
and thank god. Not all of us have those contacts.
Hey, look, you have one of the greatest contacts. - I do.
hugh hefner, he's a friend of mine. You could call him up.
you could say,"would you do me a favor? "Would you buy a hot dog for 10, 000 bucks?
it's for charity, bah bah bah." Right?
and you never did that. And I think he would have been the first.
he probably would have said,"no, I'll give you $100, 000."
we made a group decision to be very careful.
who made that decision?
because the men made the opposite decision, and they kicked your ass.
who told you to not do that? - We were consciously aware of the fact that if we remained in this competition, we wanted to use our resources to the best of our ability.
asking Mr. Hefner to buy a $10, 000 hot dog right now.
you should have done it. He would have done it.
so you were holding back for another task.
I was holding back for a bigger task.
there's no bigger task.
in the meantime, you may be fired, right?
what's the bigger task?
you may be watching the bigger task.
I understand that.
you're not gonna win by selling $2 hot dogs.
and we talked about that, upselling, and I learned that from omarosa.
I wanted them to sell at $1, 000,$5, 000.
you respect Omarosa, don't you?
I do. I do. I respect.
I think, carol, you, in a certain way, respect her.
you probably hate her, but you respect her.
no, I don't hate her. - You hate her.
be honest. Give me a break.
Omarosa, if you were me, who would you fire?
you know, I actually think that Tiffany has potential.
she has an open mind, and I think she wants to be here.
Carol, I just think that she should probably go.
all right, let me just make a decision because, to be honest, it's not the easie I'm disappointed that Omarosa didn't do a better job as the captain.
I'm disappointed that you didn't do a better job in terms of being a new yorker and giving them the right location.
and I can't say I'm disappointed in Tiffany because she's young and she's against these two killers. And they're killers.
but I'm disappointed that you didn't call a very good friend of mine, Hugh Hefner, and say,"sir, would you contribute? " Forget about saving it for later.
there is no later. This is the time.
so I say, Tiffany, you're fired.
thank you, Mr. Trump, for having me. - Thank you very much, too.
okay, thank you very much. Good luck, tiffany. - Thank you.
she's a nice person. And, unfortunately, the nicest person is going home.
but oftentimes in business, that's the way it works, sadly.
we got to make a pact before we go in there.
we leave it in the boardroom. - Absolutely.
deal? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.
I'm back!
it's incredibly disappointing and frustrating to be the first one fired out of the boardroom.
I did what was asked of me. I did it thoroughly.
and the bottom line is, we brought in a lot of money, but we just didn't bring in enough.
I'm headed home. I enjoyed it.
I was an honor. Onward.
gene saved Nely and killed himself.
after three straight losses,
team Empresario was desperate for a win.
we're 0-3.
I can't remember ever losing three times in a row.
once again, the celebrities were out to upstage each other.
you are going to be selling tickets to Broadway plays.
with Marilu Henner in charge, the women open their Rolodexes.
I'm just gonna start calling the world here.
meanwhile, tensions between Piers and Vinny came to a head.
can I have another copy of the rules, please?
just hand me another copy of the rules.
I thought you wanted to calm down. - That's all I asked you for.
we're not fighting today, Piers. - I'm not the problem.
I'm not gonna be a bouncer in this thing.
when the celebrities hit the streets...
Broadway show tickets!
two for "Curtains."
...Marilu called on her Broadway family.
and Vinny ran a family of his own.
in my world, you have a boss... Take this.
...and you have your soldiers.
put the money - let's get organized.
not that I'm saying I like the Mafia.
I'm saying it works. Bada-bing, bada-boom.
but in the boardroom, the men edge the women out yet again.
Ivanka, how did Hydra do?
hydra raised $33, 310. - Come on.
and Vinny reaped the benefit of Hydra's win.
well, Vinny, let me just tell you, we're giving $50, 000 to your charity.
the money that you're gonna give me goes to The Lustgarten Foundation in Mitchell Berke's name.
thank you very much.
then it was back to business.
I'm a little embarrassed for the women.
you have to understand, this is now four weeks.
we're getting used to this.
Marilu made a case for herself as a leader.
you know that I've been working every single task, probably wearing too many hats.
and while Carol was fending off an attack from Omarosa...
no one can make you feel inferior unless you allow them to do so, - and she's allowed me to do so. - This is our group, - and she's eating it up from the inside out.
...it was Jennie Finch who was clearly out of her element.
it's, like, such a harsh, nasty environment, and I'm not used to that.
and you shouldn't get used to it.
but, Jennie, for my purpose, you're fired.
so, um, who do you think's gonna get fired, girls?
Marilu or Carol.
God, I hope it's Carol.
I've been after Carol for three weeks.
I prefer Jennie any day of the week to Carol.
Jennie is a sweetheart and a hard worker.
she's a better person.
I'm hoping - just hoping that Carol is the one who gets fired tonight.
why do you hope it's Carol?
you know what? It's personal.
she's a twit. I don't like twits.
everybody says business isn't personal, but business is always personal, and I want to see her go.
she just doesn't fit in, and she does not deserve to be here.
Hi, ladies.
Hi, guys.
hello. - Hey.
I can stand up for myself. I'm a frickin' New Yorker.
that's why you're still here.
I can't believe it.
I'm shocked and disappointed.
Jennie Finch goes down, and I'm gonna really miss her, but everybody has to go at one point in this process.
as long as it's not me, oh, well.
so, you know I'm doing this thing for Donald Trump, - "The Apprentice." - Mm-hmm.
and what happens is they get a Project Manager and you lead the team, and if your team wins,
Donald gives you money for charity, - so this whole thing's for charity. - Mm-hmm.
I was able to raise $50, 000 for The Lustgarten Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer.
Mitchell Berke was a very dear friend of mine.
he was my daughter's stepfather and passed away recently from pancreatic cancer.
my ex-wife, Nancy Berke, is gonna be very, very happy when she gets this check.
how much money do you think would be a nice donation for your charity?
every little bit helps.
well, on behalf of Donald Trump, I have a check for you.
do you really? - Yeah.
awesome. - It's not big.
$10 would make me happy. - This is for you, Nancy, from - from - from - from me for Mitchell.
Wow. Are you kidding?
$50, 000?
you won $50, 000?
I can't even describe how great it is.
um, Mitchell died two years ago of pancreatic cancer, and I wanted to do something, because it's such a terrible disease, and Vinny just, um - he just blew me away today.
he really blew me away.
thank you!
good morning.
morning. - Morning.
so, Empresario, you have one last chance.
this is it.
and then after that, I'm gonna have to give you some help from one of these wonderful men.
all right, let me give you some good news.
Tito won't be with us this week. He's at a fight.
so, that evens out the teams at five and four, which is better than six and four, so your competition's a little bit less than you would have thought.
okay. - I'd like to suggest that Carol be your Project Manager this time.
can you handle that, Carol? - Absolutely.
is the team okay with that?
Yes. - We're okay. - Great.
let's see if she can do a little bit better.
fellas, do you know who your Project Manager will be?
all right, well, Piers has done very well.
I mean, you've done very well.
you've been a star so far, Piers. I'm very proud of you.
with all these big, strong athletes and great actors, you've been a star, so congratulations on the job you're doing.
so, you'll be the Project Manager?
I will. - Okay.
we're standing in Macy's.
this is the largest department store in the world, and it's a great store.
it's something very special, and a company that's very special, and I'm sure you've all heard of it, 'cause it's hot as a pistol.
it's the fastest-growing footwear company anywhere in the world.
they are doing unbelievably.
and they're doing an awareness campaign.
with us are the cofounder and the C. E.O.
Duke Hansen and Ron Snyder from Crocs.
so, Ron, tell us about your campaign and what you're looking for.
your task today is to create an awareness campaign for a new program that we're calling SolesUnited, whereby we're bringing in old Crocs, recycling them, and making them into new shoes for people in need around the world.
we would like you to create an in-store receptacle bin to collect used Crocs.
we'll take those shoes, recycle them, make new shoes to donate around the world.
the Crocs executives will judge the campaign and determine the winner.
don and Ivanka will be my eyes and ears.
do a really terrific job for a really terrific company.
do well. Carol? - Sir?
good luck. - Thank you.
bring them out of oblivion, Carol.
they need your help. - We're gonna bring ourselves together, Mr. Trump.
okay, good. Let's see.
go ahead. - Thank you.
I think we go simple, direct, and from the heart.
this is really a heart campaign.
Yep.
our task is to create a receptacle bin for Crocs for their SolesUnited campaign.
people donate their used Crocs, Crocs recycles, and then they donate a pair to people who are in need.
the three keywords are "brand messaging,creativity," and "overall design."
so, that's our three points. That's it.
from a business standpoint, one of their biggest branding things is the shoe itself.
you don't have a logo that's separated from the product.
they love using their shoe.
what they want to see is a bin that's effective.
okay.
four losses in a row
the guys like to call it a slaughter, and it was demoralizing my team, so we had a lot to overcome.
the lack of confidence, the fracturing of our team.
we had to overcome all that to unite as a group.
if we don't win this, I have to take a bullet.
Yay!
Oh, hi. - This is a fun project!
what a beautiful room.
wait, wait, wait. - Unh-unh-unh-unh-unh-unh!
what are you all doing here?! - I like it. I like it. I like it.
Thanks, girls. - Let's go, let's go, let's go.
you can't be here. - That is appalling!
Jeepers. - We're right next door.
we got to be quiet. - Okay.
likely, girls.
they're right next door, so we're gonna have to keep our voices down.
the most important thing - is brand messaging - Yes.
and creativity, right? - Yes.
we know the campaign is SolesUnited, okay?
Piers, these are comfortable, man. Wow!
they're comfortable, - Oh, yeah.
and they send a message about you.
you've got "sole."
I think we focus on Lennox again.
he's a global icon, and, by the way, boxing has always been, from Muhammad Ali on...
okay, I want to tell y'all something.
wear them. Share them.
I like that. - Very good.
trace Adkins, sitting in the corner, quietly, came up with the knockout slogan.
Amen, brother!
I get it. - Wow!
if I was at Crocs and I heard, "Wear them. Share them,"I would scream, "Hallelujah!"
so, the rest of the challenge is no longer as important.
wear them. Share them. It works, right?
I just heard them talking out there.
okay, guys, we have to bear in mind they could be standing outside our room.
it's deliberate.
"wear them. Share them"?
they're gonna flip out. Shh! Shh!
it's frickin' genius!
standing there? Damn.
don't worry about it. They got nothing.
the girls' team couldn't stop themselves.
they were standing outside our room, listening in on what we were doing, so they were spying.
Vinny, I have an idea for you.
I want you to stand outside. Listen to them.
no, I can't do that. - Stand outside.
you can, mate. It's called "spying.
you want me to go rat?
stand outside there till I instruct you to come back in, please.
I got to look like I'm doing something out there.
take your coffee. Read a paper.
you are my Luca Brasi.
get out there and take this. - I got to be doing something.
I've told you I found you too irritating, right, and I've ordered you out of our room.
you an actor? - Yeah.
say, "Get the X out of here."
Hey, hey, Vinny! - What?!
get out of here! - You know what?!
I'm tired of your and I'm going outside, - and I'm reading the paper! - What's outside?
is that for real? - You know what?
I don't know. - Get out!
get out, all right?! And stay out!
xx you! - Get out!
I believe, in business, if you get whacked by an opponent, you should whack them back as hard as you possibly can, so Vinny and I created an argument that was entirely fictitious, which ended up with us screaming at each other and me ordering him out of the men's war room, which I've wanted to do, actually, all week, so it was quite satisfying.
that arrogant English bastard just chased me out of the boardroom!
and I'm tired of this stuff.
I'm tired of it, Stephen! - We're in a place of business, and we're representing a company that...
thank you.
when we walked into the war room, the first thing out of Piers' mouth was, "Vinny, I want you to go spy on the girls."
the Project Manager gave me an assignment, and I followed through, just like if the captain of the ship told me to do something, you follow through.
Hi. - What?
Hi. - Hi.
what's the matter? - I can't work for Piers.
if you girls need my help,
I would love to work with you guys today.
I can't work with this guy. - Can we meet...
can we meet on it? Just...
can you give us a second? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.
what are we gonna do about Vinny?
I think we take him. We need the resources.
and if I had to work for Piers,
I'd be cutting my freaking throat with this Mr. Trump pen.
what's up?
I just asked the girls if they want me to work for them.
Oh, yeah? - And they're voting on it.
so, go back in and tell your boss.
I will. - All right.
you think this is a setup?
no, I - no. I think it's real.
the girls want him to go work with them...
he's a good actor.
...because they think you guys are in a fight, but we all know that it's all a big laugh.
they're so serious about it.
it's up to us. Yes. Take him.
I think he's a good guy. We need the help.
as long as he can't go back.
Yeah, that's the only criteria.
great. Take him.
we made a group decision, and then I went and hired him.
Vinny? - What?
work for us. - Okay, Carol. Thank you.
you know what, mate?
if you want to work for them, you work for them.
it's called "disloyalty" where I come from.
it's not called "disloyalty." - It is, Vinny.
Piers, the girls really want me to work for them.
come here. Come here, Vinny.
I think the part with Vinny, how we acted it out and caused the big fuss, was a joke, but, you know, they really ate it up, and they took him in, and I was kind of shocked.
listen to me very carefully.
I want you to infiltrate their camp.
that's what I'm gonna do.
and then I want you to come back and tell us everything.
don't worry about it.
Vinny, get out!
we're finished, mate! We're finished!
Donald Trump said, "We're gonna give you girls one more chance to show the women of America you can do this without the men."
and then the first chance they got, they took one of the men, and I think that was a disaster for them, because he will see that as a weak and pathetic action by four strong, opinionated, independent women who should have known better.
it's all a bit embarrassing.
coming up...
the truth of the matter is I was sent to be a rat.
that's what my assignment was, and I'm good at it.
what we have to do is we have to come up with a big idea.
what happens to the shoe when you give it?
they recycle them, and then it goes back to someone else.
you got to explain that as simply as possible.
Vinny came over and said, "I'm really angry at Piers, and I want to take him down.
I can't stand him, and I want to see you girls win.
so, everybody goes, "Look, we're understaffed.
what's the big deal? Let's get him to help us.
it's kind of a no-brainer.
we have to have a buzz statement.
we have to have a statement.
if we want to do something just so, so simple, what it basically comes down to is sharing the love.
SolesUnited - Share the love.
that's good. - Straight and direct to the point.
I love this. I love it a lot.
because that's the feeling we're trying to evoke in people.
Yeah, I love it a lot.
what is that? What's that?
share - Share - Share the love.
share the love.
SolesUnited - share the love.
the truth of the matter is I was sent to be a rat.
piers told me to do the job.
I'm in with the girls. I'm infiltrated with the girls.
I was doing my job as an informer.
that's what my assignment was, and I'm good at it.
how about a Miss USA with a Croc on a leash?
on a leash? Why do you want to put a Croc on a leash?
miss USA is walking him. She's universal.
but you haven't used your celebrity status yet.
I know. - What would your idea be, Vinny?
I think, Carol, it's time for you to step up.
I would like to be. - As your celebrity status, - put yourself on the box, on the dispenser. - I would like to be.
it's - you know, we'll go a full campaign, and you'll win one tomorrow.
okay. - Okay.
use Carol in the campaign.
when Vinny came on board,
I think he kind of fell in love with us.
he actually had great ideas in the room and gave us great ideas - really was the one that said, "Let's make sure we use Carol, and this is what I think Carol should be doing."
really contributed.
I think we should go very simple, and this is what they use to advertise.
I'm using my orange 'cause it's so bright.
we make a big Croc that stands up like this.
the opening is already intuitive.
it's right here.
the actual receptacle is the Croc, so even if this is set up on a street corner or anywhere, you get the advertising of the Croc, and you get to understand the campaign.
that's my pitch.
I like the idea, for sure.
fine. - I love the idea.
I wanted the shape of our receptacle to be a freestanding Croc.
Vinny made the suggestion that Carol be the spokesperson for the campaign, and Marilu Henner came up with "Share the love."
Vinny, we got your back. No worries.
you know, we were really working hard and surprisingly getting along very well.
Carol is a really smart cookie, and I'm surprised to say that, because I've been calling her a twit forever.
and Carol's a strong Project Manager.
I have to tell you, I was very pleased with her progress.
that's good stuff.
guys, by 1: 00, right, we have to give the guys who are designing the actual bin our design.
now, let's just think about this.
wear them. Share them.
what about a picture of me putting shoes in the bin and
Yeah. - Wait a second.
guys, you know what? Listen.
is it you just standing with Crocs?
could I finish with my thought?
sorry, Lennox.
me putting shoes in a bin, and on the other side of that picture...
I like this idea.
...people - poor people - getting the shoes.
my idea for this is evolving into this, right?
is that we have Lennox, and you're holding two enormous Crocs.
Oh, I love that!
I love it.
I was aware that the Lennox thing might be getting a little bit tired.
having said that, you have to treat each challenge as a totally fresh task, and each company we're dealing with doesn't know we've already done it before.
it's Lennox Lewis, the world heavyweight champion of the world, with these massive Crocs, 'cause he's got massive feet.
and it's "Wear them. Share them."
okay.
Lennox is more appropriate to be used on this challenge than any of the others.
Stephen, stop taking pictures for a second, man.
we can do that.
if I'm going over to that place at noon,
I got to know what to tell this guy - what he's building. - Okay. You got it.
so, what I want to do, what I want to suggest, is you maximize the allowable height, okay...
which is 6 foot. - ...Which is 6 feet...
Yeah.
...and then you put the logo there, you make the little hinge with the mouth, you throw the shoes in.
Yeah. - On the back side is this.
right!
it was a very simple construction job, and we thought that was gonna be the best way to go something that would be not that expensive and be something that would be easy to move.
that's why we came up with the bin that we did.
it's a square, front-flat bin.
okay. We're getting somewhere, guys.
good job. - I like this. I like this.
trace, great, great idea.
what I really like is a big thing of Carol dropping the shoe in the thing.
Oh, that's huge. That is huge.
it's hard to give away something you love.
but do it. - That is huge.
like, as a supermodel giving away her Croc...
like I'm putting my shoe into the bin.
that's brilliant. It's simple.
I don't want to give up my shoes.
I don't either.
I suggested to the girls many great ideas, which they started to take, and I started to realize that Piers should have never asked me, a man of my intelligence, to stoop myself to be a Sammy Gravano.
so, I'm gonna be here for the photographer who's coming to shoot me here.
Nely's gonna be working with the design team.
you and I are gonna work with the construction.
you and I - - Oh, okay, good.
I was put in charge of construction because I kind of like that anyway.
I wanted to get out there as soon as possible.
so, I said, "Vinny, come with me.
we'll be the two that will go down to the warehouse.
Chad, Chad, I'm gonna have to call you back, 'cause we've got a bad connection on our end, so I'll call you back.
Oh, he's dialed off.
Marilu, you guys ready to go?
we're ready to go.
okay, Vinny, go.
Yeah, uh, Chad, please. Go ahead.
Vinny has the laptop, and I've got everything in it that you need.
okay, hold on one second.
come here for a second please, Lennox.
come here for a second. Quick.
Vinny Pastore is one of the greatest guys in the world, but when he actually started sending information about what they were doing over to us, that's cheating in my mind.
go pick that up. I'm not picking that up.
I think that God is watching us all, and, as a result of that, I won't compromise who I am.
you got two, I got two. Go.
okay, bye.
that's enough. Okay?
okay.
Oh, dude. Vinny wrote this.
I don't like this. I don't like this.
share the love is what they're doing. - "Share the love."
they're gonna use Carol to front their ad, okay?
a large cutout of Carol Alt dropping a large, green shoe. - I don't like this!
this is wrong! This is very wrong!
the whole exchange with Vinny initially was a practical joke.
it then snowballed into another situation, where he started sending information about what they were doing over to us.
that's cheating in my mind. For me, it wasn't cool.
okay, this is getting to everybody. - I don't agree with it.
that's enough.
I don't want Vinny doing that anymore. - It doesn't matter. Who cares?
it's not right. It's not - We're smarter than that.
we've already kicked their ass.
please. We don't need to do that. - Let's stop worrying about your own brand issues, mate, just 'cause suddenly you've worked it all out that you suddenly don't look great.
stephen Baldwin was unspeakably hypocritical when it came down to the Vinny operation, because after a while, he had worked out it didn't make him look that great, as a man who runs a ministry, to be doing a form of "cheating," as he saw it.
you've just thought it through and think it doesn't look great for you that we've got a rat in their lair.
my view is they started it.
we're having fun over there. That's fine.
but I don't want him bringing their ideas into our room.
that's - - Is it? - We're. We're. It's not.
we don't even care about their ideas.
we've got - we've got - we've got our own ideas, man.
but I don't like that part of it.
I'm just telling you I don't like it. - I understand, we're not...
all right, you're off the hook.
piers really showed some colors, particularly in this task, that I just - you know, I-I wasn't comfortable.
this guy's - He's, uh...really got his own way of doing things, and I don't agree with them.
SolesUnited - Wear them, share them, and be a champ.
Where's Vinny? Oh, there you are.
come on, Vinny. Let's go. - Come on, babe.
I got everything.
I was asked to do what I was asked to do, and that was to be a spy.
are you glad to be with us?
Yeah, it's fun. - Was it?
and between the time I was in there and the time we left to go to Brooklyn,I started to say to myself, "Why am I doing this?"
and I started to realize that the girls really needed a win and that Piers is nothing but a XX.
so I started to have a change of heart.
I am gonna tell you something right now. - Okay.
piers made a decision to make me be a rat.
to go and spy on you.
he said to me, code of code, - "Go be my Luca Brasi." - Right.
now, do you remember "The Godfather"? - Yeah.
and they sent Luca Brasi over to go work with - - To check it up. Right.
what did they do to him? - Killed him.
and he was sleeping with the fishes. - Right.
I am gonna tell you something, right now. - Okay.
maybe I sent a couple of signals over there.
but it's over. It's over.
I told Marilu, "I'm a rat."
but I'm not a rat no more. I'm on your side now.
so, that's what I decided to do, okay? - Yes.
well, Vinny is like a big, blustery guy.
never know whether he's telling you the truth.
you never know whether he's lying or not.
he's double-crossing us. He's double...
he thinks he's still on "The Sopranos."
Sippp. - What?
you can't tell none of the other girls what I told you. - Oh, my...
you can't, because you don't know. - Totally...No! Vinny, the Italian promise.
you know, it's like- No! - Right. Because...
Marilu's Italian. She understands that.
she knew I flipped.
okay, Trace, Lennox, you guys are gonna have to go down now to Brooklyn.
trace is gonna be the guy that makes that design work.
we're rolling. Rolling!
me and Trace had to go to Brooklyn and meet with the designers down there and come up with exactly what we wanted to achieve.
let me ask you a question.
this image is how big right now - 4 inches?
at the moment, right now.
Hey, Ivanka. - How are you?
Ivanka, would you like a seat?
um, I would love one. Thank you.
here, take mine. - Nice to see you. How are you today?
very well, thank you. - Great.
so, where we are - a familiar place.
this came - - Tell her what Trace came up with.
well, it was great.
trace had been quietly doing what Trace does.
he sat with his big cowboy hat in the corner, saying nothing, and then came up with a piece of genius when he just said, "It's 'Wear 'em, share 'em.'
I think it's a great slogan, so hopefully this all comes together for you guys.
well, so, where is everyone else?
Where's the rest of the team? - It's a bit long story.
what we found - we were put deliberately next to each other, clearly a rather Machiavellian plot created by your father to inspire...
no.
to inspire a certain added tension to the two teams.
Piers! Oh, he's terrible. - So, we discovered the girls listening in to our conversations, right?
so, we created a false argument between Vinny and myself, and Vinny was left outside, apparently ostracized by our team.
the girls heard all this, so they came and grabbed Vinny.
he, of course, then became...
I think in Mafia terms, you'd use the word "rat,and has been quietly passing us back all.
I'm shocked that none of the girls... - It is. It is.
...Had thought that this was... - Exactly. It's very weird.
what he would be doing. - It's very weird.
this is straight out of the Omarosa playbook.
for her not to think that the guys are setting her up is, uh - it's really beyond me.
I have nothing to do with the sabotage. - He's just doing...
he didn't like it. He feels that we've compromised our integrity.
my view is that - - Ivanka, do you think it's right, in business, to be sabotage?
I'm - I'm sort of into sabotage, but I think sometimes it can hurt you.
like, I don't mind.
I was a little shocked to learn that Ivanka Trump was a little bit okay with slight sabotage.
sometimes works, and it sometimes backfires.
it really just depends. - Yeah, all right, Ivanka.
look, if it all goes pear-shaped for us - because of the sabotage, I'll take the rap. - He's not good for the women.
if I were them, I'd - You know, for obvious reasons,I wouldn't have taken him.
I'm a little disappointed in Empresario.
it seems weak for taking Vinny, and I worry for them, especially because Hydra seems to be doing a very good job under the leadership of Piers.
I think he's been a leader from the get-go.
their slogan is very good, and I have to credit Trace for that.
wear them. Share them.
it's simple, it's to the point, and I really think the executives are gonna respond well to it.
that was very importatant.
she's on the side for the sabotage.
the Trumps will admire that, mate.
it's a badge of honor.
I understand why you, going back to your ministry, can't be seen to be quite so devious, but it's not a problem I face on a daily basis.
coming up... - What the hell are you doing here?
I'm here, because I really want to see the girls win.
they're taking a big chance, but it could pay off.
tomorrow your father's Don Corleone.
Yes, he is.
and later...
you know what you should do?
you should share the love.
how do you know about my thing?
why would you trust a guy, who has come out of "The Sopranos..."ever?
this is the way we want it. - Yep.
it's gonna say so.
this is gonna have a logo across the top. - Right.
this'll be the front of the box.
what we hoped to do was somehow use this logo right here as the deposit," the Croc drop," I like to call it.
right. - Let me tell you, I like this idea.
okay, let's get started.
I mean, this is gonna be a stand-alone shoe, so even if it's this big, if this much in relief - - It doesn't have to go in this way.
it can go in this way. - Yeah, it can go in that way.
carry it like a coffin.
we're in Brooklyn. We got a great concept.
I'm hoping that the girls win and I'll be able to face the music, 'cause I've been through tougher "beep" than this before, and, you know, I know how to swim.
what the hell are you doing here?
you are the ugliest woman I've ever seen.
what are you doing with the women?
the truth of the matter is...
and I'm saying on camera and I want you to tell your father I'm here 'cause I really want to see the girls win.
that's the truth.
I don't care what anybody else thinks. - No, I think you also want to s- yeah, but I think you also want to see Piers fired, possibly.
you want to see Piers lose?
which do you want to see more - the girls win or Piers lose?
both.
piers doesn't have the common sense to realize there's a difference between the characters I play on television and what I can do in this corporate world.
I'm not Pussy in real life. I'm Vinny Pastore.
okay, give me your plan. - Okay, this is our plan.
it's gonna work like a mailbox.
let's say it's standing alone.
and when you put your shoes in, you push the thing down, and it accepts the shoes.
so, we have this ad campaign where we're gonna have Carol with one shoe kind of on her heart and one dropping into the bin, - let's say, and it's "Soles United" - - This is not Carol now.
this is a cutout of Carol. - Yeah, a cutout of Carol. - Okay.
6 foot tall. - SolesUnited - Share the love.
the concept that the women have right now is really good.
it's definitely catching. It's pretty mechanical.
I hope that within the time that they have they can get this together and get it done in time.
you know, naturally, with someone like Carol Alt as part of their team and to be their spokesperson, that's certainly much more attractive an option than, perhaps, what the men have, so it's one of the times they can finally really play up on their celebrity because of their looks.
I think that will really play out well for them.
and is this a sabotage move, Vin?
is this a sabotage move?
like, as if they weren't losing badly enough, you have to rub it in a little bit more and just...
what if I told you the truth?
would you promise that you would not tell anybody - except your father? - Yes. Yes.
no, it's total reverse.
they think it's a sabotage move.
double agent? - Yeah. Thank you.
all right. - I want the girls to win.
I want your father to be proud tomorrow.
I really think they got a little too cocky this morning, and they said, "Go over there and destroy the girls."
I says, "Yeah, sure."
Vinny pulled me aside when I questioned him on this.
I think he was surprised that I figured that out.
and he said, "No, no, no, I'm telling the men that, "but I'm actually acting like a real double agent here.
I want to see the women win.
I really don't like Piers, and he wants to see Piers fired, so he's taking a big chance, but it could pay off if he gets rid of Piers.
now, am I putting my head on the chopping block?
Yeah, and I'm even getting a little nervous talking about it right now.
but that's up to your father to decide, - I know.
Hey, Vinny, what did you do?
tomorrow your father's Don Corleone. - Yes, he is.
irrespective of, you know, Vinny's involvement right now,
I think an extra man on Empresario's gonna help them with the manpower that they need to pull off a win.
perhaps the lack of manpower on the men's side will really sway things in their favor.
do well, guys.
I think - This is what I think. Listen to me.
here's where we are - - Listen.
Vinny still over there?
Vinny's still over there.
it's okay. We just got a spy in the other camp.
it's all good.
you don't agree with it? - No.
you didn't disagree with it. - I did not say anything.
well, Right. - I didn't say anything.
I should have protested. I didn't. I should have.
I didn't really like that whole scheming thing, the spy in the other camp.
but I think it's a little underhanded.
you know, who's to say, you know?
piers could have a visit from Karma.
she could be unhappy with this whole situation.
coming up...
one challenge I have in mind, Piers, and that's for you to give your life to Jesus.
you think that day will ever come?
don't start preaching to me, Preacher Boy.
I'm just trying to be nice.
Hey, man. - What's up?
there's no reason for me and Lennox to even be here.
the dudes built the box. There's nothing else I can do.
this is not where we need to be.
okay. Piers! - Yeah?
the boys, you know, got nothing to do.
get them to come back.
come on back to the war room.
we will. - Late.
okay.
great. Okay. What other art is there?
we're in a great position.
I think I've done a pretty good job.
I mean, I've done the same job I've done for the last two or three challenges
pretty well run the creative side with Stephen.
we work very well as a team whilst detesting the very sight of each other for most of the day.
but it's what I call creative tension between two very different personalities.
through all this creative tension comes some brilliant ideas.
seriously, you and I have to start a company together.
I agree. - We'll make trillions.
I agree, mate.
crucially, we'd always get stuff done, which you could not say about most of the others.
Piers, here's the best part.
you know what I think now, already?
that you and I could get any challenge done between us, right?
if you put Lennox and Tito or any other combination, they wouldn't be able to.
that's right. - That's the truth.
I certainly need you in the future for one challenge I have in mind, Piers, and that's for you to give your life to Jesus.
you think that day will ever come?
I-I'm a believer, mate. Really. - You are?
Yeah. I'm a Roman Catholic from Ireland.
I was educated by a group of nuns in England, so don't start preaching to me, Preacher Boy.
I'm just trying to be nice.
I respect him for his faith.
I respect him for being a born-again Christian.
I could just do with less preaching, particularly when the behavior doesn't live up to the preaching.
are you suggesting I need to find something?
I've always had it, though.
you're the one whose life was so sickeningly depraved you had to somehow claw out of the abyss by finding something decent with your life.
it's always been part of my life. - Good.
you see, the weird thing about God is how He works in mysterious ways.
we both presumably said the same prayer that we win "The Apprentice."
and we both believe that prayer's been answered.
now, one of us is gonna be massively mistaken.
that was big, dude. - That was big.
that was big. - Absolutely...dude.
got it. Laughing smile. There. That's nice.
let me see. I think you need a bigger smile, 'cause bodywise, you're perfect.
what we heard from the client was that they wanted an incentive around the donating of old Crocs shoes to be recycled to be given to needy people.
big smile. Laughing smile. That's it - Big smile. See?
much better.
they're shooting Carol's photo.
watch. Come on. Come on. - Yeah.
smile. See? Smile. That's it.
the center of our campaign was the receptacle for recycling the shoes.
it was a giant 6-foot shoe.
pretend there's a shoe there. - Yep.
there's the opening mouth.
the logo will be right about where your head is.
we created an ad campaign around that, and the line was "Share the love."
there you go. I like that angle.
nice. Keep that, keep that, keep that, keep it.
that's good. I like that. Yeah.
we're - we're not trying to be funny. Go ahead and do your thing.
being a model and doing a photo shoot is so second nature to me, I don't even think about it.
I don't think about who's there, who's watching.
the guys were trying to unnerve me.
you can't unnerve me in my element.
move.
yes? What would you like? Get back.
what - what - No, I have a question.
what? - We just knocked on the door.
what are you talking about? - Calm down.
what...what are you taking pictures of Carol for?
is she gonna be dropping a green boot?
you know what you should do? You should share the love.
how do you know about my thing?
share the love, drop the green boot, yeah?
okay, you think you're so funny?
okay, I'm gonna go in here and see what you guys are doing, - Share the love.
Mr. Smarty-Pants.
share the love and drop that green boot, that green shoe, very cleverly.
it's okay, 'cause I know about your frickin' crocodile box.
great! Great. Remember - - That was adorable!
remember, share the love.
you know what?
the next door know every single thing we're doing.
I think Vinny is a snitch. They know everything.
he says, "Well, you're sharing the love."
well, we feel Vinny's a corporate spy, because the guys came over and they knew our entire slogan.
it's just disappointing that the guys are playing a game within the game within a game.
share the love.
I didn't want Vinny in there the whole time, because I wanted to enjoy the moment of them discovering that Vinny was a rat.
and then we have to create the recycle thing and
did you see her face when I said, "Share the love"?
I want you to look at the pitch.
mate, I know, but did you see her face?
you're a - what do you call me?
a shallow little Liberace?
literally one of the best moments I've had in my life.
seeing Nely's face.
you're a deeply ill Hannibal Lecter.
I've got to be honest part of it was just pure humor on my part.
why would you trust a guy who has come out of "The Sopranos..."ever?
they know everything, so somebody's telling them something.
I think corporate espionage is a cop-out, and if Piers really sent him to spy on us,
I think that's really evil and dark and he should be punished.
and I think if he really did this, he has to be fired. He has to go.
but you just lynched Vinny.
V-Vinny - At least he got out of Brooklyn.
you're terrible.
they know everything we're doing. They know everything.
he says, "Well, you're shooting Carol, and share the love."
Hi. - Hey, Marilu. Hang on a second.
can you please get out of our room?
why are you guys in here?! - Close the door.
get out! - The door's open.
out, Baldwin! What the hell?!
I'm gonna kick your butt!
that is no way to share some love.
here's the thing - keep an eye on Vinny.
we think he's, like, calling over to the guys, giving our information.
they know everything.
they just came over and said, "Share the love, baby. Share the love."
are you telling them, "Share the love"?
play the game. - I didn't know you were saying all of that.
play the game. Keep going.
okay, I think we have a double agent here, but he's swearing to me
you're not supposed to tell her that, 'cause it's gonna get out.
you just got to tell her to trust what we're doing.
tell her to play the game.
just play the game. Just keep our eye on the ball.
we have a great campaign. - Play the game. Play the game.
we have a great campaign. - Keep an eye on him, okay?
I will. Okay. Bye.
Vinny is so confusing and such a blowhard at different times, saying he's doing this, he's doing that, he's doing this, he's doing that.
but it seems like noise to me.
this is not about high school.
it's really about keeping your nose to the grindstone and getting the job done.
so, how am I sabotaging you?
just - I don't want to talk about any of those things.
did she just say it? I didn't say it. - I know. I don't care.
I don't care. They're be- They're 10 steps behind us.
let's just keep moving forward, - Okay? - Okay, good.
that's all. - Good. All right, good.
so, let me tell you the latest, just so you're up to date on everything.
Vinny told them everything, so they came in here and said, "Oh, share the love," and I - But I didn't...
he's a snitch? - Yeah. So, then I...
there's nothing worse than a snitch.
you do realize that I have to destroy Vinny?
he's betrayed us. - Oh, yeah, he betrayed us.
he betrayed our trust and our loyalty.
I know. We took him in.
what an ass XX.
he's always talking about loyalty and trust.
I called Marilu. - Ooh. I want to...
I connected with Vinny.
you know, he was my buddy.
I can't believe it.
Vinny is a rat.
Hi.
you want to talk to Vinny? Hang on.
Hi.
Vinny, I got information that you have betrayed our trust and our loyalty, and it's unacceptable.
that's the information you got?
the Hydra team knows exactly what we're doing.
you told them all of our ideas, and I just want to give you a chance to tell all of the team while we're listening if that's true or not.
well, why don't you just trust me and let's just keep continuing to go in the place we're going?
no, no, no. Just answer my question.
did you tell them what we were doing, Vinny?
did you betray our trust?
I told Marilu I did that.
What?!
Marilu knew that you did that?
I told her in the van- - Wait, no.
that I did that. - Let me just tell you something. No.
he said that he has to play a certain game with them.
I did not know that you told them our slogan.
you guys - - I trust Marilu.
I trust Marilu. I trust Marilu.
you know what, Marilu? Put Vinny on the phone.
he's right here.
we're both here. - I told her after.
Vinny? - Yes?
you will appreciate this. We no longer need your services.
all right, thank you.
I just got fired by the girls now. - Okay.
I can't be- What the hell? - I cannot believe I got to play a game with the guys.
well, you go play with them. We don't need you anymore.
and then he's gonna try to play Marilu?
excuse me?!
for a guy that was in "The Sopranos" and knows about loyalty, he certainly doesn't know anything about it.
there's nothing to me that's worse than disloyalty.
I think that that's evil.
if Piers and Vinny really conspired to do corporate espionage on us, they should both be fired.
okay, I don't want the fact that Vinny was a corporate snitch to affect us at all.
no, I know. - No, this whole situation is detracting from our focus.
we know- - We got duped.
all right, let's just move forward.
done - He's gone.
right now, things are looking very bleak.
Vinny betrayed our trust, and, as a result, we could be headed for another loss, and that terrifies me.
first Piers said to me - - "Go over and spy."
no, here's what he said, - You came over to spy.
here's what he said to me.
he said, "Go spy on the girls. Go be Luca Brasi."
but I am working legitimately for you guys.
in my mind, I am on your side.
I told you what happened. Did I or did I not?
you didn't tell me that you told them our information.
I said I gave them - - No, you said you were gonna give them a little bit of information.
I said I gave them information. - That's what you said.
so, did you tell them that we have a big shoe?
no. I-I told them any information I got before we left the boardroom.
they wanted me to be a spy, and I got caught, okay?
but when I got caught, I got caught as a double agent.
I got called a rat.
that ain't funny, because watch what happens to the rat.
now the girls ain't never gonna trust me again, and I don't think the guys want me back.
I'm a man without a country. I got no place to go.
now you're mad at me, too, and you're supposed to be my friend.
I'm disappointed in you, Vinny.
I flipped, and you girls are kicking me out of here?
they're gonna kill me, man.
that's your plight. Whatever.
they used me to sabotage the girls, and then they ratted me out.
if they think it's funny, funny like how?
am I clown? Do I amuse you?
I really hope that the guys lose tomorrow "you tried to sabotage the girls.
you're fired.
I went with the girls to spy on them.
then I realized I didn't want to do it.
but what's aggravating is, instead of me revealing all this information tomorrow in the boardroom,
piers tells the girls I'm spying, so now I want Piers to go home on a ship back to Britain, and the name of the ship is the "Titanic.
who's that - Vinny? - Yeah, it's Vinny.
come home, brother. Come home. We missed you.
you all right? They convert you?
Vinny, great job, man.
great job?! - Great job, mate.
is that what you have to say?
honestly, my friend, that's not - - Right. Absolutely.
it's a logistical thing. - Brilliant work - brilliant.
did they ever say anything to you?
all right, listen - let me tell you something.
tell us. Tell us. I got to hear this.
when the woman found out what was going on, she...
what woman? - Marilu?
Marilu. - Yeah.
Marilu - she put me out on the street.
they called her?
she put me out on the street like a dog.
why did you do that?
because - Wait a minute. - You do not send somebody.
wait a minute. Let me give you...
do you know the real- in the real world - that I would not be walking back into this room? - I know, mate. In the real world, I would be chopped up, - I know. - and I'd be in a suitcase, - I know. - and I'd be in a trunk, and I'd be going to Kuwait.
Vinny, Vinny, we're not - - Man, let me tell you something you don't turn in on your informers. - Vinny.
I don't know what kind of mob movies you watch in London, - but over here, - Vinny，the rat gets killed.
Vinny, we weren't dealing with the Mafia.
we were dealing with a bunch of female celebrities.
I know you like to think you're - - Oh, you don't know Marilu, man.
she's not going to kill you. All right?
I knew he wasn't gonna get murdered by Marilu Henner.
all right? It wasn't gonna happen.
so, all this, "You don't rat on a rat" stuff.
I mean, please, spare me.
we're actually doing very well, guys.
I would like to think we can have everything wrapped up by 6: 00 this evening.
they started it. We finished it.
they spied first. We killed them.
end of story, all right?
I subscribe to the Donald Trump view of business.
if your opponent has one good limb left, then do everything in your power, in a business sense, to remove that last limb.
and that's my business plan. I want to win.
after the challenge,I will be charm personified to the ladies, as I always am.
I will wine and dine them, and I will be chivalrous to the point of James Bond chivalry.
but rather like Bond, when I'm working, I work to kill.
sorry. Sorry. Good night, guys.
what is your problem? - If you want to share the love, we'll be out dining tonight.
you're such a XX.
Oh, dear.
Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.
that bin looks so great! - Lot's of greens.
Oh, my gosh! - The super Croc.
Oh, my God!
that's like a little mini version.
Yeah. We're going to win. - It's just a little mini thing.
Marilu, fabulous. - This has to totally be clean, - so let's just get to work. - Yeah.
they'll pump up the red ones.
let's get all of them - every one of these - in.
I think, truthfully, I'm more concerned about our presentation, 'cause this is to die.
they're not gonna nitpick whether there's one more shoe or not.
I think we should really think about what we're gonna do now.
we definitely need time to rehearse.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure. This is a complicated presentation.
the way the guys handled themselves on this entire task was appalling, and we overcame huge obstacles yesterday.
but if the client doesn't like it, the client doesn't like it.
don't bring any points that they could zap us on.
Why? We did such an amazing job.
there's no reason to doubt our own work.
they're gonna do that for us.
right, chaps. Here we are.
Oh, great.
let's have a look. - Looks good.
love the wheels.
love the croc.
perfect.
everything clearly- - Plants- you want plants?
I want the plants to be strategically placed, probably here.
it's all about a scene.
- Let me see. Let me see.
show them the sign.
let's hang it up, where's the tape?
careful, careful, careful.
don't - - It's gonna be perfect.
it's gonna be perfect. Lennox, be careful.
came out well, didn't it? - Gorgeous.
I think that the product that we've come up with and the idea and everything's great.
I do. I'm - I'm - I'm really happy about it.
I think everything looks good.
they are gonna love this.
why don't you try and help?
why don't I try to help? - Try and help the team.
I know it's a weird concept for you, but...
maybe I don't feel like doing nothing no more... - Tell you what because I think what you did yesterday by sending me over to spy on those girls...
Ohh. - ...Was totally uncalled for.
you are now winning the Hypocrite of the Year Award.
you told me to do that. - Yeah.
you're the hypocrite. - I'm the hypocrite of the year?
Yes. - I told Marilu I was a spy.
and she's such a compassionate person, - You're a bitch boy.
she said, "Stay here and help us." - Unfortunately...
did you really think I was gonna spy on those girls for a Brit?
you didn't? - No, I didn't.
Oh, okay. - I am not ratting on anybody.
okay. - And I developed their concept, - Yeah? - and I hope they win...
good. The best thing - - ...because I hope we lose, - and I hope you get fired. - Fine.
I couldn't believe that Vinny was playing both sides.
I guess his motivation behind that was to make sure that Piers loses, but he's not letting Piers down, he's letting the whole team down.
I don't think that's the right thing he did.
let me tell you, the best thing you said to me today is that you designed their concept.
that's right.
you were the creative brains behind their team?
that's right. - Great.
and I designed the logo, - No, trust me and I also told Carol to be the spokesman, so if they win, it's because of me.
great. Great! You know what?
there's no way anyone could win with your creative brain.
they couldn't. You don't have a "creative brain."
I don't have a creative brain? - No!
that's what you think of me?
that's why you used me for coffee and for being a spy.
correct. - because that's what you think of me.
you are an ass X! - Yeah.
to send me over there to spy on those girls!
so, go and play with your box.
well done. You've lied to everybody.
Hey! You put me in that position.
what a ridiculous individual.
I'm a ridiculous individual? - Yes.
Oh, Vinny Pastore...
the only thing he can do is go spy on the girls.
okay, excuse me. I've actually had enough, all right?
you will not bully me, mate. You won't bully me. - Look what you did to me and the girls!
I don't care. I'd like you to leave. - You did it to me from Day One.
I am leaving. - I'd like you to leave.
I am leaving. - Thank you. You've made your point.
thank you very much, Vinny, - for all your help. - I am leaving.
I wanted that guy off the show from Day One.
he's arrogant, he doesn't know how to talk to people, and he's a controlling freak.
case closed. Now I have no place to go.
tell someone who cares.
so- I'm not talking to you. - Okay.
I'm not talking to you, you arrogant British fart.
one word for you - ciao.
Yeah, and probably are going to have some chow, as well.
get that belly up a bit more.
I mean, I don't know what game he's playing.
I don't know what to believe and what not to believe.
all I know is that if he's the creative genius of the girls, as he claims, then this will be easier than I thought, and I will be astonished if we don't win.
I revealed to Nils - Nils - Piers - whatever his name is.
um, because of - you know, he started.
but I revealed to him what was going on through my mind, and he told me to get out.
Vinny. - How are you, Donald?
can I have a word with you alone?
Yeah, sure. - Okay.
when I went out in the hallway, who comes off the elevator but Donald Trump?
and I said, "Donald, I got to talk to you."
Uh...your boy is a man without a country.
meaning you? - Yeah.
go ahead.
the girls are there, and the guys are there.
all right. - I need you to make a decision.
do it in the boardroom. - Okay, fine.
he gave me some nice advice - "Stick around.
I'll talk to you at the board meeting.
okay. All right.
thank you, Donald. - I love this guy.
okay.
hello. - Hello.
good morning. - Good morning.
good morning. - Good morning, Duke, Ron.
so, let us see your presentation. - Thank you.
would you give up your favorite pair of Crocs?
what if I told you that this shoe was going to a child who was going to walk a mile for water?
then would you give up your shoe?
would you give up your Croc?
our idea today is called "Share the Love,"the love you have for your Croc.
we proudly present to you the Super Croc.
first of all, we wanted you to imagine these all over the country, all over the world.
we have a handout that explains your program and what the company's about.
people would be able to have the experience of coming in, putting their Crocs, and using it as if it's a mailbox.
so they would put it in, they would lift the arm, their Croc would fall in.
on top of that, we wanted it to be a rewarding experience.
besides the fact that you feel so good for helping people, you get your T-shirt, and then your message is spread on the chest of every person who wears your T-shirt.
we wanted it to be fun, interactive, educational.
we like giving away goodies.
we want to share the love.
Omarosa, how come you chose Carol as opposed to yourself?
you would like to be doing this.
how come you chose Carol?
I think that having a supermodel as a spokesperson is a great advantage.
she's a 10. I say I'm a 91/2.
that's very nice that you say that.
I didn't think you had that in you.
Ron, Duke, do you have any questions?
I think it's very well done.
I think it hit all the points.
I think, so far, you're in the lead.
that's because we went first.
Oh, we went first?
let's go look at Hydra's presentation. Come on.
Thanks. - Thank you.
Oh, my God, girls.
Oh, my God! - Awesome.
morning. - Good morning.
Hello, fellas. - Hello.
let's see what you have.
this is gonna be a great day.
we thought very carefully about what we could give you that was great.
we've come up with three things.
the first thing is a great star.
Lennox Lewis is one of the most recognizable stars in the world.
the second great thing we're gonna give you is a great bin.
the third and most important thing we felt we could give you is a great new slogan.
gentlemen...
SolesUnited - Wear them. Share them.
it's a good slogan.
to be a champ," like Lennox, "You need sole.
on the side, "Wear them and share them."
it's all about these people wearing Crocs.
we believe the vividness of our bins will attract word of mouth.
it was word of mouth that made Crocs what it is.
we think this will get you huge chatter.
we think, though, we're gonna leave you with a massive problem.
you're doing 7 million pairs of Crocs a month.
we believe if you take this and you use it aggressively, we believe that you're gonna be selling 70 million a month.
the biggest problem you're gonna be having is getting enough supply to meet the demand.
thank you very much.
very good. - Okay. Anything else?
we look forward to the new supply problem.
thank you. - Thank you very much.
so, fellas, what do you think?
I thought both of them were quite good, actually.
very good. - The women were well-choreographed.
I thought they did a great job of presenting.
very good job of presenting. - Very good job.
and they had some really good elements.
the shoe - you know, it's an icon.
it would bring people, I think, to it, wondering what it was.
the shoe would really draw kids into the program - as far as giving. - Yeah.
I think it was a little bit friendlier.
very dynamic, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah.
however, the men had a-a very good slogan.
Yeah, the men - - Wear them and share them.
Yeah, I think the men's slogan was strong.
I like the colorful box.
having Lennox on it was - is a huge plus.
what did you think Hydra did wrong?
I don't think they had as complete a campaign.
Yeah, you know - - They didn't have backup pamphlets or T-shirts.
and Empresario?
the receptacle might be difficult to make.
and expensive. - And expensive.
so, what is the end result?
who do you like better of the two?
coming up...
you wanted to tell me something before. Let's go.
they're sitting down. They're sitting down.
I'm standing back here.
it looks like it's my execution today.
the snitch has entered the room.
what's up, Vinny?
Vinny...you wanted to tell me something before. Let's go.
they're sitting down. They're sitting down.
I'm standing back here. It looks like it's my execution today.
it is sort of interesting you don't have a seat.
it's a little bit interesting. - Yeah.
did you all come in together or not?
not with Vinny, no.
Why? Was there a problinny?
I heard there was a problem.
was there? - Yeah.
I asked Vinny to leave the team this morning because his behavior was not conducive to a professional presentation.
and why is that?
because he was behaving in a very erratic manner shouting, screaming, claiming that he was now working for the girls...then for us, then for them.
I couldn't quite make head nor tail of it, so we had a frank exchange of views, and I asked him to leave.
so, Vinny, what happened? Tell me.
you got - I mean, you've got your side of the story.
okay, um... yesterday, um...
Pierce gave me the assignment, as the Project Manager.
is it Pierce or Piers?
it's Piers.
piers gave me the assignment, as Project Manager.
you don't mind being called by the wrong name, right, by Vinny?
I don't really care what Vinny calls me to be perfectly honest.
...to inform, to rat...on the girls and to send back messages, which I did, until...
well, the English have been doing that for years.
well, now I'm in the office with the girls, and I gave them some very, very good suggestions, which I think they accepted, and, uh, Marilu and I were assigned to go out to the warehouse.
on the ride down the West Side Highway,
I told Marilu what was going on.
he told me that, uh,that Piers wanted him to, you know, spy on us - but he's turned on Piers and that... - So, he became a double agent?
he became a double agent.
and - but it was so - I mean, the story was so, - like - so crazy. - This is both interesting and complex.
and it's so juvenile. - Go ahead. Go ahead.
juvenile? This is a first. - I mean, it's really juvenile.
the bottom line is you guys used me. - With respect.
okay, with respect... - That's what happened.
...the bottom line is - - I got used, and you ratted on a rat.
okay, the bottom line is you give a rat enough rope - and he hangs himself. - Thank you.
and everything Vinny has now said means one thing absolutely nobody would trust him again.
Mr. Trump? - Stephen, what do you think?
Mr. Trump, what started out in the beginning a bit of a humorous joke snowballed into an opportunity - for us to gain information which - - An opportunity to spy on the women. - Yes. Correct.
initially, I went along with the joke of throwing Vinny out to make a scene to distract the girls and have some fun.
then the girls invited Vinny to join them.
no, I walked in and asked them if they needed me.
when Vinny walked in to see you, did you find that to be a little bit strange, 'cause he's on the other team?
Absolutely. - That's not even spying.
that's just walking in. - Absolutely, it was completely out of the blue, and we had so wholeheartedly embraced this task about helping people that when we saw his distress, we talked about it, and we said, "He's in distress. He needs help.
was he in distress? - He was.
he was completely freaking out.
but that's when it was still an act.
I'm a little bit surprised, to be honest.
well, wait, was the distress an act, or was he actually in distress?
Vinny, were you acting, or were you just upset about something?
it was - it was an act.
I'm just disappointed in your team, because this was your opportunity to possibly win on your own, and by taking him in, if you win, if you lose.
Yes, if you lose, you can blame Vinny.
if you win, it takes a little bit away from you that you felt you couldn't do it by yourself.
no, it wasn't - That never even entered into it that we didn't feel we could do it by ourselves.
I sent out Vinny purely as a little Trojan horse.
would you bite or wouldn't you?
and the first chance you got to take a man in to help you, you took it.
but espionage - - That's not true.
come on, Piers. - Espionage? Wait a minute. Let me finish.
let me finish.
the added benefit, to me, was it got Vinny out of my room, because he offers us nothing as a - as a team member.
thank you.
Omarosa, let me hear from you.
you're not a big fan of Piers,
what do you think?
espionage, Piers?
you must have been so intimidated that you would lose as Project Manager - that you would stoop so low. - Oh, no, it wasn't espionage.
it was sabotage.
it's the same difference. - Wait a minute.
no, there's a very big difference.
espionage means we're spying to get your information...
that's what he was doing, Piers. - ...because we think your information will be useful to us.
I knew your information would be useless - because you've lost every task. - Well, let's see.
what I wanted to do was sabotage, disrupt, unsettle.
you were next to us, and we achieved all these things.
you know, he really is English, fellas.
this is what - I tell you what.
Hey, I know a lot about the English.
I happen to be part of the clan.
but I'll tell you, you have a lot of English stuff in you, - don't you, huh? - Very much so.
let me remind you, ladies, you were outside our door listening in.
I saw you. - What?
wait a minute. - What?
what are you talking about?
I saw you listening in to our conversations.
that is not true. - I said, "Who? Who?
not at all. - I could only make out shadowy figures.
that wasn't - - That was other people.
I knew it was you. - That was not us.
Vinny confirmed to me that.
no, I'm not backing you up in one aspect of today...
Vinny, I don't want you to back me up. - ...because the first thing you said to me,you called me a fat Italian.
you also said I said - I helped the girls create their thing. - What did you call him?
I didn't call him "a fat Italian.
Yes, you did, and that's a racial remark. - I called him...
and the second thing he said to me - - What did you call him?
I called him "a very fat Italian.
okay. And the second - So, be careful.
you're gonna - You know, there's gonna be two guys following you in London now.
you know something? - So, the other thing is...
with respect, you are not...
sorry, you are not - - The second thing he said to me...
this is - - All right.
maybe I am. - You're not.
how do you know?
because I've got every respect - - You don't know who I am.
you're not Don Corleone. - You have no idea who I am.
well, I know you're not Don Corleone.
you have no idea.
look, I have no wish to prolong this. - You have no idea.
so, you want to keep playing this game?
you insulted me a little too much when you sent me out to be a rat and then turned on me.
I cared for those girls the minute I walked into that room.
your decision was wrong. - Thank you very much.
as I was saying, anyway, we saw the girls spying.
that's not true.
and I said, "Okay, you want to start a nuclear war, you got to have the biggest bomb.
but they're saying they didn't spy. - We didn't.
but I saw them. - You 're a liar. - I tend to believe them.
we were too busy. - He's a liar.
and you're giving me your word - you didn't spy? - No, we did not. - I swear to God, no.
I don't think they would have thought in terms of spying.
no. We were too busy trying to do our task. - We were focused on our task.
they walked in to ask us first. - So, somebody was looking through your door, - but I don't think - - No, that's no one of us. - Vinny confirmed to me -that they had gotten information. - No.
maybe it was Vinny.
Vinny became a double agent, so maybe Vinny.
we know Vinny's cheating on everybody. - But Vinny doesn't look like this.
Vinny's cheating on everyone. We know that.
well, maybe I came back to the room to say they were spying to screw your head up.
great. It doesn't screw my head up.
well, look what's going on today, buddy.
you know what, buddy?
we've put on a whacking great presentation without you.
I don't think so. I think the girls beat you out.
isn't this such a major distraction?
you had asked me if I believe in sabotage, and I do if it's well-calculated and if it can be used to further what you're trying to do, - Yeah. - Perhaps, right?
if it's well done.
it seems like you took a huge risk by sending Vinny, who you don't like, you don't trust, and obviously doesn't trust you, in to sabotage the women - to see what would happen. - Let me respond to you, Ivanka.
it worked perfectly because...
wouldn't you have preferred somebody more loyal, - maybe, so at least you know... - No, absolutely not.
they don't change teams? - No, because I knew - that it would end like this. - Piers, you don't know if it worked perfectly, - you don't know if you won. - No, I don't know if I've won.
if you lost, it didn't work perfectly. It'd put you to lost.
no, because Vinny was never gonna contribute to our creative process.
he hasn't done from Day One - fact.
second fact - as you can tell, there's been a total breakdown between Vinny and I in terms of a working relationship.
and what about the rest of the team and Vinny?
the rest of the team and I have no problem at all, as far as I'm aware.
no, but what about the rest of the team and Vinny?
they like him, but, you know, without him today, we did a great job, and my point is I have to think about.
we don't know that yet.
no, I don't, but I believe we did a great job, and I have confidence we did a great job, and I believe going forward that Team Hydra will benefit from not having this histrionic drama queen threatening to kill me every five minutes, because I am one of the creative forces for the team.
trace, I feel like you are a good moral compass.
what do you think about all this?
you know, I didn't approve of the whole thing.
I thought it was kind of silly.
but I didn't say anything. I didn't protest.
you know, I was kind of like Stephen.
I thought, "Okay, it's just gonna be "a little funny little joke for a few minutes and then we'll move on.
so, is this mostly really Piers against Vinny?
this isn't really the whole team against Vinny?
well, that's kind of what it.
that's what it turned out to be, you know?
but - but they go at each other a lot, you know?
I've noticed.
I think, fundamentally, there is a difference here in the methodology.
our Project Manager in this task is somebody who has a far more aggressive attitude about how to get things done than everybody else.
Stephen, you went along with it, 'cause you came into our room and you guys were making fun of what we were doing.
that's where I was getting to. - And you were - Like, - you were baiting us. - Who did that?
you're a Christian. I didn't expect that from you.
Nely, who did that and when and where was I?
because you said he's a Christian.
he - I just - I - - So, that has to do - "A Christian doesn't spy? - When I found out that they had been spying on us, it really, like I just was very disappointed in Stephen. - Do Christians spy, Stephen?
well, this Christian doesn't spy, and, as a matter of fact.
no, I- - And you're a born-again Christian - and a very strong believer. - Absolutely. I have my own ministry.
that's terrific. But- - I'm working with kids.
do Christians spy? She's saying you're a Christian.
I can only speak for myself, sir.
I'm - I'm not the judge.
okay, let's say you are the judge and you lose this task.
who would you rather see continue on with you?
if you could only choose between Vinny and Piers, which would you take to keep going with you?
Ooh, Don, Jr. - That's a very good question.
well, I mean, it's the fairly obvious question, right?
if there's a rift, one of them probably has to go.
which one is it?
if you could only choose between Vinny and Piers, which would you take to keep going with you?
Ooh, Don, Jr. - That's a very good question.
well, I mean, it's the fairly obvious question, right?
if there's a rift, one of them probably has to go.
which one is it?
I would perhaps, uh, feel more comfortable if Vinny were to continue.
trace? - Wow!
I'd probably keep Vinny.
I would have to go for Piers, because it's all about winning, - and he's very strong... - Mr. Trump?
...with a lot of the stuff he's done.
he's good.
Vinny, you were gonna say something?
why did Piers tell the girls that I was an informant while I was sitting next to Marilu Henner?
I can't understand that logic until today, when I realized when I came into this room is he had the intentions when he sent me over was to get me fired, and that's the game.
and I realize the game, - so I would like to say this - - It's a game. It's a smart game, in a certain way.
we were set up next to each other, and the most obvious trick was to send in a rat. - Well, Piers, did you set Vinny up?
Yes. - Yes.
Mr. Trump? - Did your team set him up, - or did you set him up? - Mr. Trump?
I didn't share my ultimate hope, which was that Vinny and I clearly cannot work together.
Mr. Trump, I would rather go home back to my family than have this conflict.
Mr. Trump? - Stephen?
perhaps the girls could find it in their hearts to show Vinny some forgiveness.
you mean take Vinny back?
I don't think it's appropriate for them to do that.
I don't think we should be putting them on the spot. - Is that a ploy?
it wasn't their problem, it wasn't their fault, and I don't think we should be doing that to them.
they were spied on, or they were something.
something happened...
Oh, yeah. - ...That was very different.
and Vinny,
whether you like it or not, he listened to Piers.
he didn't have to.
but Vinny is no rat, and he was doing what his Project Manager told him to do.
Yeah, but he ended up being sort of a double rat.
Yeah. He did. - He's double rat. Triple rat.
but that's the worst name to get. - I still don't know whose side Vinny's on.
in fact, I think in a certain way, Vinny, you would have preferred the women to win.
I did want the women to win.
that's pretty - - Absolutely amazing.
well - Well, I don't understand.
if I was in their camp.
you basically would want them to win for the following reason.
number one, you like them.
number two, you don't like these guys as much, - but in particular, you really - - No, I love these guys.
I love these guys. - Okay, but you really hate your leader so much that you'd rather have the other team win.
that's not why I want the girls to win.
I want the girls to win because they need a win.
no, they don't. - But we want to win fair and square.
I feel they needed a win. - But, Vinny, they don't.
the second thing is I just - - It would be nice if they win,
but, you know what? They're tough. They're strong.
I felt that what Piers did by sending me in, he was kicking them when they were down.
let's find out who won, okay?
the executives from Crocs thought the men were fantastic.
they really thought you did a good job.
now, I can say it's enough with Lennox.
I agree he's a big star, but you can't keep using him.
you're gonna wear out his celebrity, ...people are gonna get tired of you like they're tired of me.
they're gonna say, - "I can't stand this guy anymore." - I agree. I agree.
I've got Trump up to the gills.
I've got Lennox up to the gills.
and you don't want to be in the same company as me, so I agree with the choice and everything else, but it's probably enough.
they loved what you did.
and they loved your display case.
and it wasn't even a contest.
they picked you as the winner, so congratulations.
and that was a long, hard four weeks.
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! - Oh, wow.
I have to say, I felt we won yesterday.
we overcame many obstacles as a group.
it was very important to me that our group enjoyed working together, and last night I think you did great, and as the winning Project Manager,Crocs has agreed to give 10, 000 pair of recycled shoes to impoverished people in Africa in your name.
that's great.
now, you can't do better than that. - You can't.
in addition, Carol, you're getting $20, 000 for your favorite charity.
what is that charity?
Oh, look at you, Carol.
I thought you were tougher than that.
that - Isn't that nice? That's nice, Carol.
you did a great job, and they liked your image very much.
Carol, well done. Congratulations.
what is your - That's okay.
you take your time. - It's my brother's charity.
what is the charity?
it's all right. You take your time.
the Tony Alt Memorial Fund.
okay, yeah. - It helps children.
that's great. - We're very proud of you.
thank you. - You did a very good job.
and I heard she was a great leader, and, folks, Omarosa said that she was a 91/2, but Carol was a 10.
that's a big statement for Omarosa.
I never thought I'd hear that - coming out of your mouth. - I learned a lot from these girls.
I really did. - We had a great time.
and we really pulled together.
and thanks for the help, guys.
how ironic is that?
you used a man to help you win. - Vinny, are you okay?
no, we didn't. - Are you all right, Vinny?
I'm very happy they won.
I know these guys are gonna hate me for that, but I'm very happy they won.
in fact - come on.
did I help you out a little with the campaign?
did he?
Vinny... - I think we were on our way.
he just saved us time. - Okay. Fine.
I think they did something very special.
I tell you what - I think they did something very special.
creativity is an amazing thing, and I think what they did was really terrific.
and I don't know if anybody helped them.
I think they had that right from the beginning.
we did it from the beginning. - The concept.
we knew what we wanted to do.
Mr. Trump, I've enjoyed my run.
I collected some pretty good money for my charity.
but I just don't feel that this is a healthy environment for me, and I would like to resign from the show.
I fully understand that.
I fully understand that. It's been tough treatment.
there's no question about it. I've seen you go at it.
I'm not gonna have a heart attack over this guy.
it's me thinking about I'm 61 years old.
do I want to see my children grow up?
all right, you know what I'm gonna do?
I don't want to do this in front of the women.
get out of here.
Congratulations. Great job. - Thank you so much.
that was a great job. Congratulations. - Thank you so much.
well done. We're sorry.
you don't have to quit. - I do what I want.
good job.
all right, Vinny, sit down.
way to go.
let's go watch with our champagne. - And our tequila.
you guys so emotional for my brother's charity.
it's such a new charity, and ohh!
it's so great. - Yeah.
who wants some? - Is this what winning is like?
ladies, it feels better to win. - So much better winning.
Cheers, and here's to your brother's charity.
thank you very much. - Well done.
Congratulations. - Thanks.
I love Ivanka. I love her.
shh, let's watch. Let's watch. - She's such a powerhouse.
sit back. I can't see.
so, Vinny, I'm only disappointed that you want to resign or quit or whatever it is, because I just don't think it's your personality.
I just don't like the environment anymore in my life...
because of Piers? - ...Where I have to...
but you like Lennox. - No, it's not - Listen...
wait, wait. Let me ask you.
I love Lennox. - You like the other guys?
I love - I love these guys. And you know what?
I don't have anything against him.
it's just that I don't need anybody to rile me up.
I mean, I'm not the only person.
that's part of the game.
okay, it's part of the game. - It's part of the game.
now, maybe you want to call it a game, - It's part of the game.
but it's a war. - But do you wake up in the morning and fight with people?
Yes. - You do?
my whole life is a fight.
my whole life is a fight. - And - and do you...
it's no different than him, except I don't use my fists.
I sort of use this.
my whole life is a big, fat fight.
and, Vinny, you could have fought and you could have beaten Piers, but you didn't fight for yourself to stay over him.
you resigned before having the opportunity to do that.
and, really, two of the three independent people in the room said they would rather have you on the team with them.
well, for the team, Piers is a better leader.
I mean, I have, uh, you know, certain qualifications.
I could never do what this guy does.
so, why even go - - But maybe you should never admit that, Vinny.
see, maybe - Like, I can't fight like Lennox Lewis fights, but - I guess I could admit that, but I wouldn't admit it anyway.
I wouldn't admit it.
I'm gonna tell Lennox that I could kick his ass.
at least it makes me feel good.
you understand that?
but it's also a matter of trust.
what kind of friends am I working with?
let me ask you this - If I fired Piers, would you stay?
Oh, yeah.
so, you're only resigning because Piers is here?
Oh, I would love to work with these guys.
come on, get rid of Piers.
get rid of Piers. Get rid of Piers!
I think he's gonna fire Piers.
let me ask you this.
if I fired Piers, would you stay?
Oh, yeah.
so, you're only resigning because Piers is here?
Oh, I would love to work with these guys.
well, then, why didn't you fight before you resigned?
why didn't you fight for your decision? - Because there's no way your father's gonna ask me to stay.
why is that? Two of your own teammates
two independents.
okay, there's only one - Lennox said he would rather have Piers, but Trace and Stephen both said they would rather you stay on there, so, I mean, if you have that working for you, - that seems like a pretty big thing. - I-I-I...
you can't just go and say, "I resign, I quit,I this or that," and then take it back.
you can't do that.
that's like saying I missed a shot in golf, but I'm gonna do it over again.
you're not allowed to do that, see? - What do you want me to do?
what would you do if you were me?
Mr. Trump, I am not trying to kiss your ass, but I believe that you are as successful as you are as a result of your wisdom, knowledge, integrity, strength, intelligence.
these are powerful words.
but integrity and character...
I would rather have less success and a better name than anything else, - as I said before. - So, what would you do?
can I just pick you up on that one minute?
no, let him - Let him just finish. Go ahead.
because, actually, this is totally disingenuous.
wait. Let him finish, Piers. Wait. Go ahead.
if I were you, I'd let Piers go.
he's sweating. Piers is sweating.
look at Piers' face. He's red.
look at it. He's sweating. Oh, my gosh.
in your career, have you always, regardless, done anything to win, even if it meant hurting someone?
I have no comment.
I can't comment on that.
could I just take Stephen up on his extremely pious position that he's adopting here, which is that he wanted nothing to do with the sabotage?
because there was a moment after he'd expressed his view very clearly to the camera.
he kept turning to the camera.
I want nothing to do with this.
about an hour later, he said to me, "Piers, the piece of paper with the information from Vinny is there."
"you should look at it." - That's not true.
this is a guy who is a rank hypocrite...
that's not the truth, Mr. Trump.
...a rank hypocrite exposed by the camera.
secondly, the reason he wants me to leave is because if I'm gone, he stands a much better chance of winning.
one of the things I'm concerned about is a winner fights to the end.
Yeah, I-I - Y-you know, uh...
you understand that.
I understand that, and I also understand that Piers has more determination and more desire to be the Apprentice than I do.
sir, may I say something? Lennox, how do you feel about quitting, just generally, coming from the background you do?
well, I-I don't like people that quit.
it's - It's go and go until the end, and, uh...
this guy - I've seen him get the hell knocked out of him, and they thought he was out. They thought...
all of a sudden, he comes back from death.
he doesn't know about quitting.
no, Well - Well, the thing is about this game, it's all mental, and if you're not mentally strong, that's when you're gonna quit or - or decide to leave.
and let me ask you something, Lennox.
boxers - A lot of them have great physical ability.
I've seen guys that fought you.
they're bigger and even stronger. - Right.
and you beat them, because you beat them with this.
you can't even beat some of these guys with your body.
but you beat them with the head. Do you agree with that?
I totally agree - It's not just physical ability.
it's also mental ability - even boxing.
I would like to say I am not quitting.
I am not walking away.
I am doing what I feel is best for me and for the team.
let's go back to phase one. Let's just let me resign.
you know what, Vinny? You're a special guy.
you're a special actor. I accept your resignation.
I'm not gonna say you're fired, because there's no reason to say it.
I accept your resignation. - Thank you, Donald.
I think you're terrific. Go ahead.
have a good time. - Okay.
get out of here, everyone. Go. Go.
Hey, Vinny. Vinny.
business is not personal. - I know.
that was unbelivable.
Whow!
last week on "The Celebrity Apprentice..."
you're an absurd celebrity wannabe.
you're in the wrong place. You're in my war room.
piers and Omarosa's feud got physical.
I was getting a bit overheated, so...
stephen also couldn't get along with Piers and told Mr. Trump that he could no longer work with him.
Mr. Trump has suggested that I become a member of Empresario, which I have accepted.
that's mental, man. That's mental.
next, the teams were off to create a living window for Vera Wang and Serta.
trace showed his romantic side.
the world's greatest romance deserves the world's best mattress.
Cleopatra, Mark Antony. - I love it.
on Empresario, Project Manager Omarosa put Nely in charge.
you are a big-time Hollywood producer. I need your vision.
Nely was former head of Telemundo.
I'm expecting her to be more informative.
when the windows were finished...
Ooh, they're so fabulous!
...Vera Wang and Serta were impressed.
well, this is totally unexpected.
the winner is Hydra.
piers reveled in Omarosa's defeat as she led her team to their fifth loss in six weeks.
Omarosa, better luck next time, yeah?
and in the boardroom,
Mr. Trump brought up Nely's previous failures.
you always have to learn from history and the past.
Absolutely. - Well, you got lucky twice.
you keep bringing it up, and I don't know why you haven't gotten over that.
Nely challenged Mr. Trump, and he had enough.
Nely, you're fired.
to be honest, seeing Stephen Baldwin's crushed little face with Omarosa defiantly saying she was a greater genius for just doing the most obvious thing in the world...
...it was absolutely priceless.
Oh, my Godness.
it's so satisfying, I can almost hardly eat my pineapple.
Omarosa was their Project A Manager.
it was always obvious to me, from that moment, they would lose.
Omarosa is one of the most venomous poisons that I have encountered in 25 years of business.
team Hydra -- You chop off a head, we keep coming.
Yeah, baby! Let's not gloat.
let's gloat.
"let's not gloat." Omarosa.
she's such a pointless, irrelevant, ghastly little creature.
Oh, my God.
was it a brawl?
Oh, my God. - Congratulations.
Thanks.
Nely is an awesome person. I have to say that first.
but you have to fight for your life in the boardroom, and I know what I need to do to keep from being fired.
ha ha, my dear.
I'm always controlling what's happening with my team.
I have the losingest record in the history of "The Apprentice" at this moment.
I think I have the second losingest. - You think so? No.
Oh, no, beyond you, 'cause I'm combining both seasons.
Baldwin is a broken man, isn't he?
and having four women that he has to answer to...
Yeah, not easy. - Not easy at all.
I mean, wild horses wouldn't get me to work for that team.
literally, I'd rather shoot myself.
I would not do it. I'd say, "Mr. Trump, you can fire me, but I'm not gonna work for the enemy."
Omarosa speaking. - Hello?
Mr. Trump would like you in the boardroom immediately.
okay, thank you very much.
we're on our way.
thank you. - Thank you.
we have to go to the boardroom...immediately.
all right, just stand. No reason to sit.
as you can see, Nely is gone.
you folks are just killing the ladies and one very good man.
Yes, sir. - But they really are beating you.
so we're gonna change up the team.
you're gonna do a little change-up here, Lennox.
all right? Can you handle it? - You sure you want to do that?
because -- - I want to do it so badly.
I hate to watch every single week their being beaten.
I've picked two teams that I think are very evenly matched.
Tito, come over here. Sit.
you don't look happy, Tito.
he doesn't want to go on the girls' team.
Lennox, I have news for you. Sit right over there.
Marilu, take a seat next to Tito.
our beautiful Carol, sit next to Lennox.
thank you.
trace, sit next to Marilu.
Omarosa, next to Carol.
so that leaves Stephen and Piers.
so that leaves Stephen and Piers.
what do you think I'm gonna do now?
Stephen, you can stay right where you are.
hop into that chair, right next to Trace.
no, no, no.
Oh, don't be a coward, Piers. - I'm not sure I can do this.
I have to work with her? - Piers, you're doing just fine.
you know, you're doing just fine.
he's whining already.
you know, the English are very tough.
listen, we fought two World Wars.
we never had to deal with this.
right now, Piers, she's your teammate, so I congratulate you.
this is the new Hydra on my left, the new Empresario on my right.
how do you feel as teams? How do you feel?
I'm very excited, Mr. Trump.
Omarosa, you think you're gonna get along with Piers?
I've worked with the scums in -- - Scums?
I think that's off to a bad start.
that says everything I need to know.
okay, now it's time for a new task.
one of my favorite places in the world is Central Park.
I have buildings surrounding Central Park.
I control and run the Wollman skating rink, and it's been one of the great attractions in New York.
central Park is a special place.
you're going to run horse and carriages.
do you know what a horse and carriage is?
people that are in love, like, possibly...
I'll tell you a great scene, Omarosa.
you and Piers sitting in the back of a horse and carriage.
why do I think that won't work?
you're each going to be given three horse and carriages.
right now, they're getting $34 for a ride.
you're going to try and get much more than that.
it's very simple.
at the end of a very short period of time, it's the team that makes the most money that's going to win.
george and Ivanka will be my eyes and ears.
they'll be all over the park.
they'll be watching every single move.
all the money made will go to the winning Project Manager's charity.
and for the losing team, somebody will be fired.
everybody understand?
go ahead. Good luck.
come on in. Welcome to your new home.
everybody's been a Project Manager, I think, except for myself, so I guess this one's mine.
since we're working with horses? - Yeah.
that seems appropriate, doesn't it? - It seems appropriate, for sure.
being Project Manager, if we win this thing, it's gonna be a huge hit for my charity.
I have a 6-year-old daughter, Brianna, and she has severe food allergies.
so I've gotten on board with this organization：
food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network.
it's a cause that's very, very important to me and my family.
we got to, like, try to call everyone we know, and even if it's $1, 000-- whatever it is.
I need people who are gonna come down and spend some money.
break out the little Sicilian black book and get me some cash, baby.
Billy Baldwin coming down tomorrow at, like, 11: 30, noon.
got $1, 000. You rock, dude.
and also my sister.
she owns, like, one of the most successful restaurants here in New York, and she will give us champagne if we want.
everybody knows the game. Everybody knows what they have to do.
it's just get on the phone, bang it out, call people you know, try to get some VIPs to show up.
this thing says, "Central Park South and 5th Avenue."
why have you been having me tell people "59th Street and 5th Avenue"?
cause that's Central Park South.
it's the same thing? - 59th Street is -- Yeah.
where do you live? - Brentwood, Tennessee.
see, now, I don't come to Brentwood and start telling you how to get around Brentwood, do I?
I'm very happy with the team that I'm on now.
everybody is working really, really hard.
and more than that, everybody was having fun.
I can tell you right now, you know Piers is going bananas right now.
do you want to be P. M. or not? - Yes, I do.
I want to be, because I've raised not a single dollar for my charity, so far.
is he P. M?
Yes. - Okay.
you agree? - Yes.
my immediate thought about the new Hydra was we could do really well if we could just keep a lid on the obvious tensions.
Omarosa, whatever has gone on between us.
you don't like me, I don't like you.
this is business. I want to win.
cessation of all hostilities till the end of this task, right?
deal. - Okay, you got it.
if I'm called to the boardroom,
I will simply apply one criteria:
the ones that come in will be the ones who raise the least personal money.
I made it very clear to them.
the challenge was very straightforward.
go away and raise money.
if you had any way of getting $10, 000 in cash, that would bail me out massively.
every dollar goes to charity.
thank you so much. Thank you.
I want you to come down to Central Park tomorrow and buy a ride off me.
I know, I know, but you know how these things work.
it's -- I'm...
no, I know, but you know...
Omarosa, I could tell immediately, was struggling to raise money, because she's not really a celebrity and doesn't have that kind of pulling power.
tonight, I just want you guys to go back and continue to call anybody who can help us, because this will be entirely about the big money.
coming up... - If you touch me, - you're gonna get punched in the face. - You're embarrassing.
I don't want her near me.
and later... - John Rich!
good to see you, big boy. - All right, my friend!
I put in a call to another country brother, and he shows up.
okay. - Are you ready?
am I ready? Yes, mate, I've been ready since 5: 00 a. m.
the task this week was to run a horse-and-carriage operation around Central Park, where the team that raised the most amount of money won.
just so that y'all know, - I did the commitment form as you asked. - Great.
if y'all can at least go through it and sketch out what you think estimated numbers are for each person.
okay, can you spell my name right?
uh, what is your name? - Since I'm Project Manager.
Piers, like a pier.
Oh, an "S." Oh, my bad.
it's a basic journalistic rule. - Um...so...here you go.
spell the name of your boss correctly.
you're not my boss. You're a manager. There's a difference.
I'm your boss. - Trump is my boss.
I'm your boss. Trump's not ur boss. - Don't get fooled. He's my boss.
well, just spell my name right, Omarosa, yeah?
cause I am the Project -- Okay.
there you go. There's your request. - See u realize Trump does what he said, right?
I don't like that kind of behavior.
shut the up, turn around, don't talk to me.
Omarosa woke up this morning, knew she was gonna produce no money, knew that was the only criteria I laid down, so she did what Omarosa does best.
she threw one of her tantrums.
you get on the van, and you argue about your name being spelled - instead of motivating your team. - This is what you do...
when I find out you can't spell. - I'm gonna teach you about leadership, ass.
I have absolutely no respect for Piers.
my whole mission was to break him down, and I knew his weak spots and I exploited them.
the mother of your children hates you, Piers, and your children hate you, Piers.
they're embarrassed by you.
leave my kids out of it, you foul-mouthed little tramp.
you keep having problem- - Read my lips.
you're a disgusting little tramp, and you're off the show.
no, no, no. - OK - You're going, baby. - You don't fire me, baby. I do what I want.
you've raised no money. That's why you're worthless.
I do what I want. - You've raised no money.
you ain't doing jack for me, Piers.
I ain't going nowhere. - You know why you've raised no money?
it was about going below the belt.
can you tell your children to be like you, Piers?
no, because you're a...
you can be as abusive to me as you like.
shut the up. Shut the up. - You can say I'm having affairs.
she can insult me as much as she likes.
I'm a big boy.
every other sentence from her mentioned my children, mentioned my family. You know, I find it just sickening.
Oh, my God, this is horrible!
let me say something. We want to get out.
do the decent thing and piss off. - Nobody's listening to you.
I've never seen a bad fight like that.
it was terrible.
there's disunity in the team and the fact that, you know,
piers wants Omarosa off and Omarosa is not going, anything can happen.
that was so refreshing.
she's a pointless celebrity-wannabe idiot.
she's out, mate. She's out.
it was a gorgeous day in New York City.
it was great to be out in the sun.
it was great to be with my team. We felt really good.
I felt, you know, energized from it, because it was a whole new group.
it was guys, which I -- You know, I always like guys anyway.
and it was just time to stir up the pot a little bit.
two dozen in that one already?
Yes. - And two dozen here.
so, on the way to the horse and carriage, we thought about, "Hmm, let's get some roses, some champagne, put smiles on the people's faces who were buying the rides."
who knows how to run this damn credit-card thing?
me. Me. - Where is the leather-binder thing?
we go down to Central Park and kind of realize that Team Hydra is right next to us.
horse and carriages are neck to neck, right next to each other.
and seeing Lennox Lewis and Piers over there, it just seemed like a challenge for me.
and one team has to use a specific three guys.
the other team has to use a specific three.
Yeah, yeah. I'm leader.
what's the names of our guys?
are you doing okay? - I'm doing great.
you are doing great. - I'm doing great.
I'm very excited. I like selling.
that's my thing. - Do you?
I really believe I had the best team.
we're good to go. Start selling, guys.
nobody works the streets better than Tito Ortiz,Stephen Baldwin, and Marilu Henner.
they all have boundless energy.
they never slow down.
I couldn't have asked for anything more.
Oh, my gosh, it's so nice to be with the guys.
Oh, oh. - It's a different energy.
really. - Right.
this? - Yes.
do you have anything else? - We have a table coming.
you're fired. - I'm not going anywhere, son.
I don't want you on the team. I don't trust you.
I'm not going anywhere.
obviously, we're one member down.
I fired Omarosa, but she's still standing there.
I don't know what she's doing here.
stand away from me. - You back the up.
I ain't going nowhere. - Oh, dear.
piers has told me that I'm fired.
I've been fired by better, trust me.
manage your team, wimp.
I'm talking to these members of my team. - Shut up.
I don't want to talk to you.
please go away. - If you touch me, you're gonna get punched in the face.
just let you know that. - Oh, go away.
if you touch me, - you're gonna get punched in the face. - You're embarrassing.
Lennox, could you stand to one side?
I don't want her near me.
manage, P. M. Manage, P. M.
what do we do about this revolting creature?
why are you passing it off on Lennox?
he's not Project Manager.
do you see me moving? - Tell us what you want us to do.
I'm moving away from her. - Project Manager, manage the team.
I ain't going nowhere, son. - What do I do?
I ain't going nowhere, son.
we need to keep this team together, though.
how? It's already apart.
for me, it's always about the team and always about the management of that team.
you keep him over there. - Okay. Thanks, mate.
Lennox and I have been doing the best we can, keeping people apart, so we have a dual job now.
is this not for your charity? - Yes.
let's stay focused. - She's not a celebrity, mate.
she's got no power to get money like we have, so now she's going for Plan "B,which is just to sabotage everything.
at the end of the day, we have got a lot of money coming our way for charity.
I want it processed properly. I want the accounts done.
she's got the accounts bag.
I don't want her having any of this stuff.
how are you gonna work it out? - You tell me.
celebrity carriage rides for charity!
10 minutes. You can just get in right now.
the task was to run carriage rides in Central Park.
the team who makes the most money for the sales wins.
you gonna take a carriage ride? - All right.
take the lady on a carriage ride.
all right. - Don't lose that.
Hey, Billy Baldwin, how you doing, buddy?
Hey, Trace Adkins.
what? - Got my brother William.
never heard of him.
they've got Billy Baldwin there, mate.
I certainly felt it was necessary to bring out the second-Baldwin-brother bomb, so to speak.
I need you to walk around with William Baldwin...
okay. - ...and see who - wants to make the biggest donation. - Okay.
I just took Billy around, and he's so charming, and I think people recognized him and recognized me.
you'll go $2, 000. - Yeah, we'll go $2, 000.
okay! Whoo-hoo!
is that about winning? Do you know -- more money.
Yes. The more money we get -- The more money, the better.
your carriage awaits.
my chariot awaits. - Your chariot awaits.
all my brothers are very busy, so when they take the time out to help out or support something I'm doing, it's always a blessing.
way to go, babe!
he's pimping his brothers, man.
he had my brother Alec come. He had me come.
he had my mother come, my sister come.
come on.
Janet, how are you?
have you brought gifts with you? Are you bearing good news?
I brought credit cards. - Credit cards?
is that of any interest? - Marvelous, definitely.
I was talking to Gerard earlier, and he very generously said to me he might be able to go to $5, 000.
Yes, I can do that. You are a star, Janet.
how do you do? Very good to see you.
I've had about five of my contacts turn up.
how generous are you feeling?
quite generous. - Are you?
you know, it's good, but it's not great.
we have a cash donation.
they're all from me, so far, guys, so I need some help.
hit the phones for the contacts - I got it. I got it.
who were supposed to have given us money, - none of whom have shown up yet. - Right.
we cannot take donations without giving them a seat.
we have a very limited number of seats.
I do not want to sell these tickets anymore right now.
we deliberately held back carriages in case a big donor came and we could use their money to fill up that carriage and get it going.
we couldn't give them all away for $50 and then not have enough seats left for the big donations.
these horses go out when our big donations get here.
we can't sell those tickets. - Right.
celebrity carriage rides right here!
carriage rides! Celebrity carriage rides!
no, I don't want you selling the tickets, mate.
carriage rides! Celebrity -- Hi, cuties.
sorry, don't buy the tickets yet, please.
they're not available. - Celebrity carriage rides!
please, they're being -- - Get out of my face, Piers.
I'm gonna warn you once of that.
if you sell them a ticket, they're not getting a ride.
your children are so disappointed in you, Piers.
leave my children alone, all right?
not in front of everybody, mate.
leave my children alone.
I'm asking him to walk away, Lennox.
he keeps coming in my face.
Omarosa's got a lot of venom inside her, and, you know, I'd rather be on her good side than her bad side.
you know, certain things that were said,
I don't think I would have said them.
it seemed to cross the line. It seemed very ghetto.
it seemed very mean, very nasty.
I want to make it clear. She is totally ignoring me.
no, you fired me, Piers, you idiot. - ...and going completely against my instructions, OK?
that's what happens when you fire your staff - at the beginning of a task. - She's raised not a dollar so far not one dollar from Omarosa.
not one of her pledges has turned up.
celebrity carriage rides right here!
I don't know how these Hydra things are always here.
the Hydra carriages are always sitting here.
the Empresario carriages are always gone.
how's it going? - Hello, George.
how are you, sir? - I'm doing good. How are you doing?
I'm doing pretty well. - How's it going?
really good. We've raised close to $12, 000.
empresario is really pushing the people on the street and doing a good hustling job.
I think they could be very successful.
celebrity carriage rides! Step right up!
I love you. - I love you, too, beautiful.
thank you so much for donating. - Of course.
okay, I've got $1, 000. - Awsome!
tito's girlfriend, Jenna, showed up, and, boy, she plunked down 1, 000 bucks and was insistent that her carriage ride be with Tito.
she must really like that fella.
Aw, it's our first carriage ride, pumpkin.
central Park was nice. I've never been on that ride before.
it was cool to be with a beautiful woman like my girl, Jenna, and to see one of the biggest parks in the world.
the best thing is it's all going to charity, and that's what really matters.
Oh, yeah, but it's also really cool to win.
Yeah, it's gonna be nice to win, also.
I don't know, that's just my thought, because I like to dominate.
what park are we in right now? - Central Park.
this is a $1, 000 money order.
Yes! $1, 000. Appreciate it, bro.
no, you know we got to support you, man. - Yeah, yeah!
5 grand. - Thank you so much, sir.
he hasn't take a carriage yet.
marvelous. Another one of my donations.
thank you. - How's it going?
he fired me in the van before the task ever started.
so, what are you doing now?
Oh, I'm gonna keep doing the accounting job and make sure that Lennox and Carol and even Piers are supported, because the one thing I don't do is quit. And even...
Ivanka, just so you understand,
I fired her. She's still here like a bad smell.
I don't know what she's doing here.
she trashed my children, my family.
everybody she can think of.
she's a disgusting piece of slime, and I want her off this team.
you are a disgrace.
I'm trying to break these guys up.
you're a peacemaker. - Right.
so, what the hell's going on here?
and I'm breaking them up.
they told me to be quiet so they can argue.
is it very distracting for you? - Yes, it is.
Yeah, it's distracting to the whole team.
I visited Hydra, and I have to say I'm very disappointed.
she's brought not one dollar in.
not a dollar.
a big-ticket item could save them, but, either way, Hydra's falling apart.
I literally wanted someone to strangle her slowly and then pour sulfuric acid over her horrible diseased torso.
it seems like the feeling is mutual on both sides.
Yes. - It's repulsive.
your father needs to know, this is beyond the pale.
the language -- - I have a feeling you may end up telling him.
I will.
how are you folks?
you want to do a carriage ride?
you're French? - Yes.
um, you understand?
all I know in French is cuss words.
trace is a cowboy. He never has his hat off.
he's got that real cowboy flavor to him, so he was very comfortable working around horses.
my horse is slow.
it's on the verge of a heart attack.
should be a 15-minute trip. Takes my horse 30 minutes.
shove a bottle rocket up his ass when he comes back.
trace was very decisive, very strong.
he took the ball and ran with it and is definitely one of the strongest players we have.
John Rich! Good to see you, big boy.
all right, my friend! - How you doing?
see this?
one old country boy is trying to raise money for charity and puts in a call to another country brother, and he shows up.
I was a few blocks away, and I said, "You know what..."
I'll come by and support Trace in anything he's doing.
country boys stick together.
I just had a little left over from last night.
how's that?
how does 5K spend around here?
it'll spend, my brother. - For charity, baby.
how about that, man? - You got it.
trace Adkins! - John Rich from Big & Rich, man.
well, they don't call me "John Rich" for nothing.
there comes your carriage, right there. Come on.
where do they take me -- just around the block?
just 15 minutes around the park. - Oh, you got it.
I don't really think that we could have done any better.
I mean, our carriages were full and going all the time.
there was 100% dedication on everybody's part.
so really all I had to do as Project Manager on this one was just sit back and let my guys go.
they really didn't need any guidance.
they didn't need a referee. They just worked.
$2, 500. Too bad for you, Lennox.
can we recruit now off the street?
because it's 12: 32.
I've got a $5, 000 donation coming. - Okay.
he'll either get here in time or he won't.
I'm worried that the guys across there.
I've seen a lot of cash coming in and Billy Baldwin and stuff.
and, obviously, we're one member down.
I fired Omarosa about two hours ago.
she's contributed nothing at all.
it's all a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
the point of last night was that everyone gave their pledges.
mine's coming. - No, I know that, buddy.
that'll help. Or we're gonna lose.
you can laugh, Omarosa. You've contributed not a single cent.
celebrity argument! - Nothing.
do you know you're gonna go down - Nothing.
as the worst Project Manager in the history of this game?
Oh, no, baby. - You can't even motivate your people.
go back to your workstation.
shut up. I ain't going nowhere. - Sell something.
get one of your people to deliver $1. - I can't wait to see your face.
Donald Trump. - $1.
I'm gonna have that man on his knees, begging and crying for mercy.
it's over. - You're useless as a father.
it's over. - You're not even there for them.
you're a pathetic waste of space. - Is there another man raising your children?
now go. You waste- - Is there another man raising your children?
either he's going down or I'm going down.
either way, I'm going out with a fight.
we've got 20- 24 minutes. - The only problem is the time.
I've got a guy trying to get here with $5, 000, so, hopefully, he'll make it.
any more money coming in?
Yes, my friend Jamie just called.
he just landed in his private plane in New Jersey.
I said, "You have to be here in time."
will he get here? - I don't know.
he's coming from New Jersey.
Lennox, you got any more coming?
another $5, 000.
no, mate, we need to have it in the next 20 minutes.
can you do that?
I've got a guy who's racing here in a cab.
if he gets here, then every one of my pledges came off.
is there any way you could get cash?
till that money is in the bank, it doesn't count.
it's a race against the clock.
mate, if you could pull this off, it might just swing it between defeat and victory.
I promise you. Seriously.
thank you so much, Lennox.
Piers, are you and Omarosa finally getting along?
no, no. I feel quite sickened and disgusted by what's happened today, if you must know.
he fired me within the first 5 minutes of the task.
he fired you? - Because of a typo.
he is Piers.
he successfully had Vinny quit, Steve switch teams, and I think he's finally met his match.
how do you think your team did?
the team did very well without Omarosa.
she was a complete waste of time.
professionally, I mean. She couldn't even spell my name.
don't know how you would feel if somebody brought you, as one of your executives, a document, on the first exercise you've worked with them on, and they spelled Donald wrong.
I doubt you'd be very impressed.
did she spell your name wrong? - She spelled my name wrong.
I asked her to redo the document.
she picked up the paper and threw it back at me.
I realized then she had no respect for me as Project Manager.
I found it reprehensible that anyone would treat their boss in that manner.
so we had an argument about the fact she couldn't spell - her own boss's name. - Then he fired me.
she then said, "You're not my boss. Donald Trump is.
Lennox, what did you think of the way they got along, or should I not ask this question?
well, you know what?
I've -- I've -- I've fought with Tyson.
and I thought that was the biggest fight I've ever been in, but, you know, to travel with these two in the van was unbelievable.
me and Carol were trying to get out.
we were telling the driver, "Drop us off! Get us out!"
I wanted to jump out in the middle of traffic.
it's crazy.
can I just pick you up on that?
the thing I love most in my life is my family, and my three boys in particular.
and when a piece of trash like Omarosa - trashes my family all day long... - No, I trashed you.
there's a difference. - And it's discusting.
what did she say about your family?
I said he was a terrible father.
let me give you one little line, - a terrible father.
just so that everyone around this table understands.
Yeah, but you don't know if he was a good father.
just so that everyone around this table can understand what I've had to put up with today.
I don't think anybody, in a TV show that's raising money for charity, should have to be repeatedly told, "What are your kids gonna think "when they wake up in the morning knowing their dad's a?
I don't think, Mr. Trump, anybody in one of your shows should ever have to put up with that kind of abuse.
I don't use that ... - I don't mind if she aimed it at me.
she aimed that at my kids all day long.
I will do anything to protect my family.
my kids in particular. - As you should.
as I should, and I'd expect - I agree. - Everyone around this room too.
this piece of trash trashed my family all day long, and I will never, ever put up with that.
I can tell you now, I'm not working with her again on this show.
is he quitting? - So if comes down to us winning,I will expect you to separate us or fire me.
all right? I'm not gonna quit, but you can fire me.
I'm never working with her again.
she's a piece of low-life trash.
you know, Lennox, I was at your fight with Tyson.
you're right. This is tougher.
it reminds me of Tyson with Lennox.
Tyson at that press conference did this kind of thing to Lennox.
what did Lennox do?
he punched him smack on the head.
he's been dishing it for six weeks, and he can't take it.
if she's been a man -- No, sorry.
we've had to deal with you for six weeks, Piers.
I've been dealing with people -- - Stop whining.
Oh, shut up. - Stop whining.
you've been dishing it to everybody at this table.
if you'd been a man, I would have punched you to the ground as Lennox did Tyson - when he also abused his family. - That's a good example to say.
great example to say. - Nobody abuses my family, Omarosa.
I was abusing you. There's a difference. - You are not worthy to me.
I'm here to raise money for charity.
don't be a martyr. - You're here to "redeem" yourself.
don't be a martyr. I was abusing you. - Redemption, for you, - involved abusing my family and my children. - I was abusing you, Piers.
there's a difference. Don't make this a broader issue.
I was going after you. - You disgust me.
my children are looking at me, thinking, "Dad, you gonna let her bring us into this - the way that she did?" - This is the same thing he did to Vinny, the same thing he did to Stephen.
Vinny never talked about my family, - and nor did Stephen Baldwin. - I talked about you, be clear.
stephen Baldwin would never have talked about my family in that way, and I hope he would respect the fact that I never got personal with him about any other family member.
but, actually, you can't work with Stephen either, right?
no, no, we had many flare-ups, - but it was never like this. - Stephen, let me ask you about that.
can you work with Piers?
didn't you want to quit because you couldn't work with Piers?
how did you feel about Piers?
I just think it's very interesting to hear Piers sounding like me right now.
well, not really, because I -- - It's very interesting to me.
Stephen's problem with me- unless I'm wrong, - Let me finish.
your problem with me was I called you a hypocrite, right?
that's very personal. - We had a debate about it, but that's about each other.
my criticism was leveled at you personally.
I don't believe anyone around this table now, if they had to put up with this diatribe constantly mentioning their children, would have accepted it.
and I don't see why I should have to accept it, and I don't accept it.
to be honest, TV show, charity, whatever it is.
but you know what, Piers? Be cool. You have been cooler than this.
I've not been seen you like this. - I've lost my cool 'cause my kids.
he's met his match. I didn't say anything about your kids.
I haven't met my match, you little tramp.
you pull my kids into it.
no one I've ever worked with in my life - He's met his match.
has ever brought my children into an argument like this about business, and it pushed a button that I never felt I would react to in business, and I have done.
well, I can't say I hope your team loses, but, to a certain extent, I hope your team loses, because it's gonna solve a lot of problems.
okay, Trace. - Yes, sir?
boy, you must be just licking your chops.
no, I'm not licking my chops, no.
Hey, but you never know what happens.
how do you think your team did?
well, I'll tell you,I had one of the nicest days that I've had since I've been on this show.
in Central Park.
I enjoyed every minute of it. - Good place.
Yeah, it was. - All you need is a horse, - and you have it made. - You know.
get rid of those tall buildings in the background, - and it's beautiful. - I felt good today.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
I had a couple of friends show up that I haven't seen in a while and that happened to be in town.
and -- And everybody.
we just got along. - Who was the star of your team?
you know what, I don't know that there I couldn't single anybody out as being a star.
I know everybody on this team performed to the best of their ability.
I have no doubt about that. There's no question.
so you're happy with everybody? - Yes, sir.
well, I think it's time to find out.
and this is very interesting, 'cause here you have a team in total unity, and here you have a team in pretty much disarray.
at least, as per you two.
so I think we should probably just right now go to it.
so, George, let me ask you, how did Empresario do?
empresario did very well.
they certainly pulled together as a team.
and they made $29, 673.
well, what does that mean, exactly, Ivanka?
I actually almost hate to say this.
hydra made $35, 184.
it's an amazing predicament that I'm sort of placed in.
well, Piers, despite everything, $65, 000 to your favorite charity.
what is that charity, Piers?
it's The Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, - Great.
which seems quite appropriate, given the way this has gone.
and the reason I chose it is that it helps the families of American soldiers who've lost their lives in battle, and my brother has just returned from Iraq, where he fought side by side with the U. S. Marines.
you did a great job for a great charity, so congratulations.
now, Omarosa, obviously, you two can't work together.
I'm going to take Omarosa.
I'm gonna ask you to go on the other team.
I think you're gonna be very happy.
I think you'll be very happy to get away from Piers.
okay, go. - Thank you.
Omarosa, tomorrow, you're on this team. - Thank you.
it's kind of like a hollow victory.
you know, it feels kinda bad. - I know, I feel like it's very...
I feel bad, we can't even, - you know, be excited about it. - I know. I know.
a team that works well together, a team that doesn't. That...
that's it. Lennox, I know exactly.
I look- I'm looking at these four people.
they worked well. They love each other.
it's incredible. And somebody's gonna be fired, and there's something wrong with that.
Yes.
dude, I hope you're having some champagne.
I don't really feel like celebrating.
what are you talking about? - Pop that baby.
pop that baby. - We just won money for your charity.
it was a really sour victory, because, when we went back to the war room,I didn't want to be in the same room as Omarosa.
I don't want to talk to her ever again in my life.
come on, man, this is like a hollow victory for me.
I need more- I need people to be more cheery.
nobody talks to me about my family in that way and remains anybody I will have any contact with.
come on, man, we have to have a toast.
Thanks. I'll thank you. - I gotta cheer for your charity.
Yes. Light it up. Cheers.
this is very tough.
I never thought I was gonna be in this position.
this is the toughest thing I've had to do in a long time.
Ivanka, what do you think?
I have to reiterate your sentiments.
trace, you had said you had had the best day you'd had in New York.
and you were out there. You were working as a team.
I gues now we have to figure out, just in talking to you, what you think.
who was the one that didn't work as hard as the others?
those- These guys put out so much effort.
when those two guys were working the streets,
I've never seen anybody that works the street like these guys do.
Marilu, I mean, she loves everybody.
she's around enough with people. - And everybody loves her. I love her.
and Tito, I mean, he works the streets, you know.
he has got such a polite demeanor, - which I found -- - You wouldn't believe it.
I found unexplainable. - And then he'd kill them, like, for nothing.
Yeah, it's unbelievable to me, that guy.
Stephen, who would you say, if you were going to be.
who is the one that just didn't do quite as well?
it's not like anybody was terrible.
in fact, everybody was good.
who do you think did the worst job on the team -- relative?
Oy.
I can't answer. I honestly can't answer.
and I think I've been a pretty straight shooter.
Marilu, you're very strong, you're very smart.
who do you think should be fired?
it's not easy. It's one of the toughest ones I've ever seen.
it's very tough. - What would you do if you were in his seat?
I would've fired Piers or Omarosa.
I almost did that.
but that was not, unfortunately, the rules of the game.
Tito, who should be fired?
well, Mr. Trump, I'm a very hard worker, and the hard work I think each and every one of us put in, we put our hearts into it.
we believe we did everything we possibly can do, and we made each other, you know, happy people.
it was nice to work with each other, I believe.
George, what do you think?
I think this is the toughest decision you've ever had to face, and I'm glad I'm not making it, because I don't know what I would do.
this is a tough one.
you're lucky you're not making it.
would any of you like to resign?
I'm being serious.
would any of you like to resign?
no, sir. - No, sir.
I'm a very hard worker, and I'm very determined.
and this job is just challenging for me, and I love it and I've learned a lot from it.
Marilu? - I'm loving this experience.
this whole thing really suits my energy, and it's been so great being with these guys today.
I'm feeling pretty good, Mr. Trump.
I'd like to stay in the game.
as Project Manager, Trace, would you want to resign?
if I were here on my own behalf, I might, but...I'm not here representing myself.
I'm here fighting for somebody else.
this is the single hardest firing I've ever had, and I've had some tough ones.
and you people shouldn't even be here.
it should be the other team.
it would have been so easy if you had just won.
we tried. We tried. - I know.
damn it. - We tried to win, I swear.
we're tapped out. - Sitting here, no matter who I do, - it's gonna be a disaster. - Next time we have a thing to raise money,
I'm calling you.
boy, you know it's true -- If you would have called me,
I could have given you 7, 000 bucks and you would have won, and I could have said, "Piers or Omarosa..."
okay, listen, the other team was a total disaster.
I wish I could have fired one of the members of the team, and we know exactly who we're talking about.
and I'm actually stuck with four great people that did a very good job.
this team really understands that this is all about charity, and I'm feeling charitable.
tonight, in the boardroom, I'm firing no one.
that's the first time I've done this.
and, Marilu, for tomorrow, you're going to the other team.
go ahead, go home.
thank you, sir. - Go home.
thank you, sir. - This was very, very tough.
thank you, Mr. Trump. - Thank you.
Oh, God. Thank God.
Oh, my God. - Would you allow me to say something?
that's never happened.
and that's a testament to the job we did.
Yes. - We all did a great job. - Thanks guys.
as Project Manager, I felt good about my team,
I felt good about myself, I felt good about our effort.
I thought we had done everything we could do.
they live for yet another day.
they do indeed. We'll see what happens.
Hi. Good to see you. - Hello again.
the teams were tasked with creating an ad for Dial to appear in Redbook magazine.
you're creating a photo essay that supports both of our core values.
on Empres Project Manage Tito let Stephen Baldwin take charge.
I think that that's a little edgy, and I'd rather play it safe.
meanwhile, on Hydra...
Carol Alt took the reins...
I think we keep it very sexy.
and decided on a more risqué approach.
they've got Omarosa, and we've got Carol Alt.
not a fair fight, really, is it?
in the boardroom...
Piers, what do you think of the ad?
I love Trace, but I just don't think I'd use him.
you think Omarosa would have been better than Trace?
only in a graveyard scene.
the battle between Piers and Omarosa was reignited.
Omarosa, what do you think of their ad?
the biting is a little bit edgy for me.
it's not biting. It's nibbling.
Hydra's choice to use racy photos paid off.
the executives thought the ad was fantastic.
the winner is Hydra.
and Mr. Trump put Trace on the spot...
trace, if you were me, who would you fire?
I would have to say Tito was responsible because he did let Stephen take charge.
leaving Tito to take the fall.
as much as it pains me, Tito, you're fired.
Oh, that was a big powerful win.
if three blokes go through that door now, - I'm going partying tonight. - If two?
Ohh. We're getting company.
Oh, Trace.
and Stephen.
Oh, you're back in here?
Tito was fired, which I was pretty surprised about.
I mean, there was a gilt-edged opportunity to nail Omarosa.
you knifed Tito straight in the back.
you took out your big lasso, and you carved him straight up, man.
I didn't lie for him. Great job.
I didn't stab Tito in the back, like Piers says.
Tito quit being Project Manager and let Stephen do it.
and I'm not gonna be vindictive or meanspirited in any kind of way, unlike other people.
I'm not staying long. I don't want to be around him.
piers was a loose cannon. There was a lot of tension,
I knew it was my time to step up and kick that British schmutz' ass.
a real tragedy... in every way.
Wow.
that is a nice room.
Wow.
we went up to Donald Trump's apartment to get the next task.
the view is spectacular, for sure.
the decor is impeccable.
and then Donald Trump walked in with his family.
that was a portrait in itself.
good morning. - Morning.
we're standing in my apartment at Trump Tower.
some people consider it to be the greatest apartment in the world.
I would never ever say that myself, but it's certainly a nice apartment.
and to my left is Melania, and this is Barron.
barron, say hello to the group.
Hi-ta!
and Barron, hopefully someday, will be a great entrepreneur.
Melania, what do you think?
well, little Trump,
what do you want to do when you grow up?
business.
businessman. - Business!
that's right, like your daddy.
that's pretty amazing. - Daddy.
daddy's a businessman. And what is Daddy building?
house. - House.
he's doing well
just 18 months old, and he's doing really well.
so, hopefully, he'll do well like Ivanka has done and like Don has done.
now, so far, we've raised $630, 000 for charity
that's a lot.
a lot more is gonna be raised over the next couple of weeks.
I love art. I collect art.
you are going to be working on a really exciting art project at the Moti Hasson Gallery, one of the top galleries in New York.
you'll be working with Moti Hasson.
he will give each team various artists for you to choose.
you'll choose your artist, and tonight, you'll sell your art. You'll price it.
you'll do whatever it takes to sell that art.
there is a minimum price for the art.
what you sell above that goes to the winning Project Manager's charity.
and the team that makes the most profit will win.
now, I'd like you to choose your Project Managers right now.
I'll do the Project Manager. Is that okay?
it's you, right? - Yes.
looks like you already have your Project Manager.
who is your Project Manager?
I'm going to be Project Manager.
that's true. That's true.
very risky to be Project Manager.
who's your Project Manager? - I'm going to be.
piers is Project Manager? - Yeah.
you don't win by not taking risks.
as soon as I knew Omarosa was going to be P. M.
I decided that this was time to go head-to-head, toe-to-toe, fight to the finish.
now, we're coming down to the final stretch.
it's going to be very interesting, very exciting.
good luck. Sell a lot of art tonight.
make a lot of money. The winning team wins.
the losing team... somebody will be fired.
have fun. - Thank you.
go ahead. - Thanks.
good luck.
we have to really kill that other team over there.
okay.
now, is there some secrets to the trade, in terms of displaying the art?
if you're saying we could throw a dart at the wall with any of these names and hit a winner, then that's great, but there has to be some technique.
you're trying to place artwork into great collections.
follow your heart.
whoever appeals to you the most is who you should go with.
that's my advice to you. That's what I do, and it always works, so...
I'm gonna follow my heart.
I hope it doesn't lead me into the boardroom with Mr. Trump.
know what I mean? - Right.
well, it's not hard for me, if I was just going on my own personal taste.
there are only a couple of them that I even...get, you know?
the rest of it's that abstract, "3-year-old threw up on a canvas" kind of stuff.
I... I don't like that stuff.
I would imagine that Piers, in his way of thinking, is gonna go for the most expensive person.
he would be more interested in selling four $25, 000 pieces.
and he has... and he has the contacts to do that, yeah?
I don't know. I know he does.
Oh, hi, there.
Ah. - How are you?
piers Morgan. Good to see you.
Moti Hasson. The pleasure is mine.
none of us really have any kind of real experience in artwork, so we had a lot of questions.
well, from these artists, you have literally five different artists.
you have four who are painters and Shirley Shor, who is a new media artist.
with all these artists, with all their works of art, there wouldn't be a... a space issue, where we couldn't physically hang them?
all of the new media stuff... you don't have just six pieces.
you have editions, so each work of art can be sold a few times.
Oh, wait a minute.
so you're saying you might have more than one piece that you sell the one you can still sell more?
of the same. Only with her, only with the new-media artist. So
that's important. That's an important concern
that is.
what we found out with Shirley Shor, which was so interesting
she actually was the number one in terms of volume.
what I need you to do now is very quickly count up exactly how many pieces we now have.
20 pieces of Shirley Shor.
we have three at $12, 000, seven at $20, 000...
Yeah. - And 10 at $2, 500.
that adds up to 20, correct? - Okay.
I think we should go for her.
they may not even know... - No. We definitely want her.
as soon as I realized there were 20 pieces, not 6,
I backed the fact that Omarosa would not be smart enough to work that out and wouldn't think of Shirley Shor as an option.
what do you think? - Okay.
the bigger price. - Let's go for Shirley Shor.
I want you all to flip through this really quickly and write down your first, second, and third choice, okay?
so, there's my 1, 2, 3. - Okay.
is this jibing with anybody else?
Yeah. - We're all on the same page.
interestingly enough, we all had, you know,
david Kramer as our first choice.
he had more pieces at a lower price point.
and it was to our advantage to have a low minimum and set it higher.
who is the biggest pimps you know? - It don't make any difference
I've just... I have called four of the biggest ballers in New York.
okay. - And all they have to do is come through.
okay.
coming up...
this is our gallery, right, not yours?
stephen Baldwin was spending most of his time peering around doorways, listening in on my conversations, and, frankly cheating.
the next step is, I'm gonna hit you, right?
are you kidding me? - No, I'm not.
Hello?
I know you're busy, I'm so sorry to bother you with this.
we're selling art tonight at an art gallery in New York.
when it came to choosing our artist, we chose David Kramer.
do you know what the price range of the art is?
between $2, 000 and $5, 000.
isn't there any way you could choose an artist that had a lower price?
the price point on it was gonna be very challenging.
I'm pounding on the phone here, trying to get some folks to come down and buy a piece of art from Stevie B. tonight.
the test is really gonna be more about realationship width who some of us can get down to buy the work.
all right, I'll see you all later.
you're the best. See you.
okay, bye-bye. - Bye-bye.
we are doing a fund-raising event with a lot of the profit going to charity tonight.
and the kind of range I was thinking is $10, 000.
when it came to raising money for people to come down there and buy some art,
piers had people on the line already.
it's Sarah. - Hi, Sarah, how are you?
fine. Well, I have Gordon here.
you've got Gordon Ramsay. Excellent.
Hi, Piers. - Gordon, how are you?
I'm ... great. How are you?
can you try and not to swear too much in this brief conversation?
I know it's almost... almost a disease with you, but if you could just keep it straight.
you... head.
the key to winning a task like this is you've got to have a great contact book.
Yeah, I can't say too much about it, other than I want your money.
I have no problem ringing up famous friends and asking for money, and they expect me to ring them and badger them for money.
I've been doing it all my life. I'm very good at it.
Gordon, I can't thank you enough. I really appreciate it.
Bye. Bye-bye.
now is the time where I don't just want to beat Omarosa,
I want to pulverize her so badly that she's not only fired, but probably never work on television again.
this wasn't business. This was personal.
okay, team, listen up.
steve Baldwin, I want you to pull up, as quickly as you possibly can, everything you can.
print the form. - Okay, so stop calling connections?
I'm gonna have you stop - Okay.
so that we can inform ourselves about the artist.
okay. - Steve Baldwin knew nothing about art, so I put him on research.
he had to do the background for the artist.
you can actually call and work the Internet at the same time, right?
uh, not really, to be honest with you.
you can't multitask? Is that what you're telling me?
well, I can't read and talk to somebody at the same time.
no, I can't do that. - It's funny, 'cause I... I
I'm doing OK.
can you give it a try, maybe?
I can make the calls, but then if somebody asks me about a piece of artwork tonight, which would you rather I know better?
I'd rather you do both.
at this level in the game, you got to multitask.
I think that Omarosa likes to spin things a little bit.
she plays the game a certain way.
and she was trying to set me up.
how are you? - Good. Good.
good to see you. Hi.
you have chosen Shirley Shor. It's yours.
can I have... - And we will be using the North Gallery - And the west Gallery. - Thank you.
it's over here, as well. - See you later.
and will they be in here, then?
was that predetermined? - They will be in there.
they'll be in there? - Was that predetermined?
because we like that space better.
it depended on the work that was chosen.
so, again, you have two galleries. Use them.
bit of a disadvantage by having two rooms, are there?
not at all. - Okay.
when we seen the space that we had to work with, you know, I was a little bit concerned because we were in the back room and Empresario's in the first room.
how do we draw people into this room?
if you need room...
uh, excuse me. This is our... this is our room.
Oh, right. Should we be in the other room?
no, that's your room.
david ... David Kramer's in the next room.
this is what I'm thinking
we don't want them to flow into that other room.
question. - We want them to walk in, and boom, boom, boom
cause they've got to find their way to their room.
okay.
we are hosting an art exhibition this evening.
and I'm the Project Manager, so my neck is on the line.
stephen Baldwin, yet again, was spending most of his time in the morning peering around doorways, listening in on my conversations, and, frankly cheating.
I have no problem with Stephen Baldwin cheating.
I just wish he'd admit it and stop pretending he's from a different moral base to me.
they can go 'round the back, right?
Yeah, but... - Yeah, but they can actually walk out and 'round the back. - Even If I have to use the bathroom?
Yes, mate. Sorry. Team Hydra rule, mate. - I can't go the normal way?
with respect, this is our gallery, right?
not yours, so if you want to go to the bathroom, go
are you kidding me, man? - No, I'm not.
every time Stephen holds his hands up and says, "I...I can't get involved in this unethical behavior,"
he seems to be the main perpetrator.
it's called "spying," all right?
and I don't like it, and I respond with severe violence.
the next step is, I'm gonna hit you, right?
you're gonna hit me? - I'm gonna hit you.
for going to the restroom?
for spying on us. You're taking all our secrets.
I have to go to the restroom. - No, you don't. You can go another way.
go out the back. Go 'round the corner. All right?
piers threatened to hit me 'cause he thought I was intruding in their space and trying to steal their ideas.
and, man, he's really nuts.
see ya.
we have 50 minutes only.
and we need our stuff up.
they've prepped it? - What's happening? What's happening?
this ... this will be up in five minutes, max.
let's go. Let's go.
time's counting down.
we only have half an hour to hang the art.
we need to really get as much in as possible, so time management is very important.
I want you put you at the front, hooking people in to our side, right?
bring them straight in here.
you'll be up the front there, mate.
direct them straight in to here. - Sure. All right.
and remember, guys, we sell four or five of those, that's it.
do we really want to put these up?
I don't think so.
they have the prices on them.
we don't have time at this point.
we've got the price sheets. We should be in control.
but I'm just... - Stephen, I have a question.
should we stick these on the wall?
they just gave these to us. - Yes, we have to.
they're about to start. - We have to do it.
we didn't know anything about art.
we had no idea what we were doing.
I think Omarosa claimed to know something about it.
I... I don't know that she actually does.
we have the option of putting it up, but it's not a mandatory thing.
I would prefer that you did it.
how would people know what the price is?
we'll... we'll tell them.
this is how things are done in the gallery.
well, let's set them. - Yeah.
we've got five minutes.
there's about the middle. - Two and two right here.
let's get 'em up, boss.
they started coming in? - You've got the red dots.
leave them so that you can put them on each label, right?
they gave us a little strip of paper that had, like, you know, six or seven little red dots, and you'd peel them off and stick them on when you sold one.
here are the red dots for you.
thank you very much.
Hey, listen, we appreciate all your help.
thank you. You've been great.
almost that time.
let's sell some stuff, bro.
okay. Whatever. - 'Cause you know what?
I'll move some paintings. - I want your charity to make some money.
it's my neck on the line. This is a team effort, but...
I don't want to go down for this one.
welcome. - Hello.
Hi, there. Welcome. Hi. Welcome.
steven Barwin, nice to meet you.
Hi, Stephen. - All right.
how are you? Trace Adkins. - Michael.
Hello, dear. Nice to meet you. - Hi. Nice to meet you.
come on in. David Kramer and the Empresario crew is this way.
david Kramer is this way.
okay, Lennox, we need you on the door, mate.
they're all coming in. Push them into our gallery, yeah?
welcome. Welcome, ladies and gentelmen.
when people walked in, I looked over and I realized that nobody was coming over to our side.
welcome. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
boy, you're good. - Welcome.
Omarosa was at the door, funneling people towards her side, so I had to get over there real quick.
let me show you ours. Let me show you.
Oh, sure. - This is David Kramer.
would you like additional information about David Kramer?
this is just a brief bio about him.
I'm shopping for art for my new apartment.
Oh, are you, really?
so I thought you could help me find something really spectacular.
I have cash with me. I want to buy something.
I'm about to cry. Which piece are you gonna select?
I like that one. Oh, that one.
I like that one. - I do, too.
that one's very nice.
$2, 800 for this one.
thank you so much! - No worries.
mm, thank you. This is fine.
I would love to think of you when I look at that one.
appreciate that. - Congratulations. I heard you got two sales.
well done, my friend. - You bet.
we are working as a team, grinding it out to get it done.
everything is coming together as a result.
and I just called him two hours ago, and I said to him, if he could call me sometime after 5: 00, but it's now nearly quarter past 6: 00, and I wonder whether you might be able to nudge him.
my donors haven't turned up yet, but they are coming.
I've got to be honest with you
I began to get a little twitchy.
I want you to stand there and look at that.
how are you? - Tell me that
you don't find it really, unusually exciting.
getting nuts. It's not even diamonds.
which is what I do. - I know.
that's excited.
so, I know you love this. - Yeah.
so what I could do to get you to say "Yes."
and to change my life?
you're the queen of diamonds.
trust me. I'm the king of deals.
I'm making you a great deal here, and I would love you to make my day.
just give me the nod.
I wouldn't even ask if I really didn't need the help.
you could just do your bit for charity.
I've never wanted to beat anyone in my life more than I wanted to beat Omarosa.
and if she loses very heavily, indeed, only one thing happens to the losing Project Manager
you're fired.
it's really hard not to really want that.
the challenge for the team tonight is to make sure we sell all the pieces.
I'm the Project Manager.
Omarosa's the Project Manager there.
Really? That would just change my life.
I don't even think you know.
come on, Suzy. You know it makes sense.
so, can I put you down for this one?
I can't do that much.
I thought I would go ahead and get this one - - 'cause I like this one. - - That would be great.
thank you.
I really appreciate it. - Thank you.
thank you very much. - Thank you. I hope you win.
thank you.
how you doing?
thanks for coming.
appreciate it. - Anything.
thanks for all your support. - Anything for you.
I did have some people come down that I called, but none of them have bought any artwork yet.
do you like visual art? I do.
come on. Let me show you something.
no, he's busy. He's busy right now.
Yeah, Don't... don't worry.
Yes, absolutely.
Carol Alt. - My name is Charls.
Charls, very nice to meet you. - I'm in the movie business.
are you?
do you have a price chart? - Yes.
okay. - Becareful.
one of my people that I invited wandered over to the other side, and Carol went and tried to get the guy to buy a piece of art...
I'll take it.
you got it.
and he did.
I got to be honest... It's a little disheartening to see them have to stoop to that level. It's sad.
I stole one of Stephen's, and then I almost stole one of Omarosa's, and then she saw me and took him away.
great.
and my people on poaching clients is all's fair in love and war.
if you're stupid enough to let one of your donors turn up and then be diverted to our gallery and they buy one of our pictures, well, then, you're a complete dunderhead.
Hi. How are you? Good to see you.
same here. - Good to see you.
piers had some heavy-duty donors that showed up.
two of the "Shangrillas."
how are you paying for that?
I have cash. - Cash. Great.
I represent Gordon Ramsay. So we just bought a...
it's nice little fiery number for a fiery Gordon Ramsay.
Hey, mate, thank you very much. Thank you so much.
tell Gordon I really appreciate it. All right?
I've never seen a man with so many connections in my whole life.
I'm just happy he's on our side.
I am the long arm of Loan Gruffudd.
Mr. Fantastic truly has long arms, doesn't he?
Yeah, mate, that's perfect.
he's been very generous -- - Absolutely.
I know he's in Hollywood. He couldn't be here.
he's gonna buy the set there of the two.
I have some big donations coming from people that I got.
we sold two of those there. We are going great.
and so, on every level of our strategy, it's working.
I'm gonna congratulate him on the sale.
this piece sold out immediately,
this one sold out immediately, and we have one piece of that left.
we've got... we've got two of those, and we've got one of those at the end.
the others are gone.
the red dot signified a sale, and the reason I like that was I wanted the opposition to be wandering around our two galleries, getting more and more terrified.
Hey. Steve Baldwin. How are you?
nice to meet you. I'm Alexandra.
Hi, Nice to meet you.
where can we get something to eat?
there's lots of places in Times Square.
you know what's really good is that funky Asian place on 7th.
Oh, it is good. - Yeah. That's a good place.
stephen was not focused and detached himself from the process.
how'd you do any sales?
not yet.
at least I had folks who turned out who believed in me, who wanted to support me.
I can't really say the same for Stephen.
that's it. Last chance.
all for charity, last chance.
I'm feeling about as good as a human being could feel.
Yeah, I mean, obviously, it's a personal tragedy for Omarosa.
I would literally be heading to Brooklyn Bridge now and doing the decent thing -- drowning myself.
Piers, how'd you like your artist? What did you think?
loved it. Loved the style.
loved the fun, the creativity.
really cool stuff. - How do you think you did?
I think we won. - You think you won.
I think we didn't just win. I think we destroyed them.
Carol, how do you think you did?
I think we did very well, yes, absolutely.
Lennox, you think you did pretty well?
I think we did well.
Omarosa, how'd you do? This was your weakness on "The Apprentice" previously, wasn't it?
how do you think you did? - And it's a repeat, because we only sold, I believe, four paintings - You only sold... - at a lower price point, Yes.
Wow. Only four paintings?
only four... two for myself and two for Trace.
and what do you attribute that to the artist or yourselves?
so have you chosen it up? - We'd have to take responsibility.
the artist was great.
you know, you look at Stephen and you look at Trace
they have a lot of contacts. You have contacts.
actually, Stephen didn't make a sell, and Trace made a great sell, and I made a sell. But
let me just ask you a question. Ivanka, how did Hydra do?
it was $164, 000. Wow!
and that's awesome. - And how many paintings?
it was 14 out of 20, versus 3 out of 16.
and what was their total number, Don?
only $7, 000.
Wow. That's a big difference. Whoa.
you weren't able to get the volume, either.
well, our strategy was selecting artwork that our contacts could buy.
I... I don't have a contact that could buy a $50, 000 painting.
so, what happened? - So they didn't purchase.
but, Omarosa, you also said that price point was a major factor in this because, in the first task, you learned you set the price point too high.
it's what you told us. - Absolutely.
so this time, you wanted to go for a lower price point.
but even at a lower price point, you actually only moved 3 of the 16 paintings, not 4. - Yeah.
it's disappointing, Don.
trace, did you know that your team lost?
this was the first time that I came in here knowing that we'd taken a pretty good...
never a good feeling. - Pretty good scalding.
never a good feeling.
do you know this is the biggest slaughter in the history of "The Apprentice"?
we've never had anything like this.
I've never seen a slaughter this bad.
this was personal.
this was personal? - To me, this was personal.
not against the team. But against-- - They say,"Never get mad, get even.
I made the mistake of getting mad, and today, I was determined... - You did make a mistake.
it was the first time you've lost your cool.
Yeah, I lost my cool and I don't, I don't
I'm not proud of the way I behaved that day.
so this was personal not in terms of the team, but in terms of, what, Omarosa? - This was about me proving a point that this competition is called "Celebrity Apprentice."
if you are a genuine celebrity, then you do have the power to pick up the phone and get money out of people.
and I have believed from the start that Omarosa is here by default.
I'm here because Mr. Trump invited me.
well, whatever. Today... - And if you keep saying that to him, you're going to be questioning his judgment.
and I actually trust his judgment.
no, his judgment is, "This was the big
just to quote him directly
the big... - But you're saying, why am I here?
Omarosa, with respect... - Why don't you ask him?
it's not with respect. - I'm just quoting. I'm going to quote...
you said it's personal. - Mr. Trump back at you.
this is the biggest slaughter in the history of 'The Apprentice.'
I'm gonna make a request to you, Mr. Trump, to kill two of them.
I want Empresario killed off tonight.
today with the biggest beating of the history of "The Apprentice." - Omarosa, you have to say they have just absolutely dec
they have really decimated your team.
and you know what? The men have done well, and I... I just... I've been doing
no, it's really not the men, because you have Carol.
I mean, she doesn't look like a man to me.
I sold $37, 000 in my own, close to Piers' big ones.
so, you, by yourself, did four times what they were able to accomplish.
now, when you say "two..." I'm just curious
and who would the second one be?
obviously, you're saying, "Get rid of Omarosa,
but who would the second... - Well, that's a given to me.
she's just been completely exposed.
so, who else would you suggest I fire?
well, did she say Stephen Baldwin didn't bring in, literally, a dollar?
I mean, this is a fund-raising exercise.
so, I mean, it seems obvious to me.
why did you lose so badly, Stephen?
I had the wrong strategy.
it was... It was... It was a slaughter.
it d... It doesn't matter when you win.
Yeah, but I was just curious.
if you had any honor, Omarosa, you would stand up, resign from Mr. Trump's show, and leave.
that's not the thing you gonna hear. - He wants you to quit. Would you like to quit?
I would never quit, not over him.
then how will you defend yourself?
one of the things you were relying on is volume sales, because of the lower price points, to appeal to the people you were able to call, but you weren't able to process any of those sales.
I'm only as good as myself... - So it's good for 3 sales?
I'm only as good as my sales team, and you're right.
so it was not your fault, then? Was it your sales team's fault?
I would take responsibility.
I- I should have brought in more sales.
this is one of those... - You said you were only good as your sales team
so that implies that it wasn't your fault, it was your sales team's fault. - No. We have to collectively take responsibility for this loss.
I... I actually object to continuing in using the word "loss" here.
this is not a loss. This is
you are bitter.
this is a catastrophe... - You're right.
of Biblical proportions. - I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, Piers.
first of all, you guys go out.
great job. Congratulations.
again, you led a team to the greatest victory in "Apprentice" history. - Thank you, Mr. Trump.
so, from your standpoint, it's very positive. Go out.
I'm going to allow you to watch what's going to take place.
thank you so much. - So you go watch.
have a good time. - I'm going to play muliple times.
I know you're going to like it.
do we know how much we raised for the charity?
Piers, congratulations.
the amount you raised above the minimum sales price is $51, 300 for your charity, which is...
the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, so I'm thrilled about that.
you are doing very well for them, not only tonight, but you are doing very well. Congratulations.
go outside. Watch what's going to happen.
thank you. I'm going to enjoy this.
make it nasty, could you?
biggest beating in history. Omarosa, see you later.
Stephen, what do you think?
you didn't do so well, Stephen.
you know, I was a little surprised at you.
what's the story with Stephen, Omarosa?
you know, over the last 10 weeks,
I understand from the men that he has never brought in money for the task, in terms of selling.
did he not bring in money for this task?
none.
Oops, she's turning on him immediately.
she's knifing them already.
I mean, you've got to hand it to her, haven't you?
this is what she's good at... knifing people.
I had 10 or 12 people there.
I had one individual that was gonna buy
did they know who you were?
Yes, of course. - You're pretty nice recognized by people. - Sure.
and I had one buyer that actually was scooped up by Carol, so...
fairly scooped up? - No, not at all.
Why? - Well, because the person mentioned that they were there as a result of my relationship with them, so...
well, were they friends of yours?
people that... they were friends of friends.
and yet, they went and bought from Carol?
Yeah, because they didn't understand the dynamic of what was happening. - But they understood that...
you wanted to sell them something, and they didn't buy from you, they bought from Carol.
right, because they believed that they were still buying it for a charitable cause.
but were you disappointed that your friends didn't buy from you or they bought from other team? - Absolutely.
Absolutely. - Are they still your friends?
I don't think so. Maybe.
now, Piers said that I should fire two people.
do you think he's right?
trace, you may think so 'cause you're probably one that won't get fired, in all fairness.
I'm not... No.
what do you think about that, Omarosa?
I don't think that you should fire two people.
I think that you've traditionally
he had an opinion, and the opinion was
first of all, he had problems with you, and he also had problems with Stephen.
he had some pretty big problems with Stephen, although they seem to have worked that problem out to an extent.
no, he threatened to kick your ass today
quote... direct quote... is that right?
he threatened to hit me today.
he threatened to hit Stephen, so...
I did say that, yeah. Nothing personal, just business.
but he said that today, so things aren't all as they appear, but, you know, I think that we did what we were capable of doing.
but when you get an opponent so fired up like Piers was, you've got to have a lot of ammunition to combat that, and I didn't have that ammunition. - He was fired up.
he was fired up. - And you know why he was fired up?
he was fired up because of you. - Oh, absolutely.
he wanted to kick your ass. - Absolutely.
do you think, in some way, looking back, in retrospect, you really hurt yourself by engaging in the conflict with Piers?
when a man calls you a tramp, a bitch, and a whore in this boardroom -- - But you said a few mean things, as well.
I didn't call her a whore. What is she talking about?
never called her a whore.
but when he said such things-- - And what did you call him?
Omarosa, what did you call him? - I called him some horrible things...
that shouldn't be repeated. - Yeah.
horrible things, Mr. Trump.
but I guess-- - Did you believe them?
well, yeah, because I know some things about him.
but when somebody's armed with a machine gun... - Geeze!
you don't come into the fight with a slingshot.
so, it is what it is.
Yeah, but you armed him, technically.
so what do you know about Piers?
what do you know about Piers? - I
you don't know Piers. - I think he's in the closet.
huh? - I think he's in the closet.
I really do. - Unbelievable.
piers is wishing he didn't leave the room.
he asked these guys in every
in the first four tasks, for Lennox to take... - Yeah, but didn't you call him
excuse me. I don't think you know him very well, and you called him a homosexual.
Oh, no. He has asked ... can I?
there are gay people around, and that's great, - Can I tell you why, Mr. Trump? - But you called him a homosexual.
but can I tell you why? - And he says he's not a homosexual.
but can I tell you why? - Yeah, go ahead.
he's asked for them to take their shirts off in every single one.
he asked for Lennox to be naked and hugged up with a Kodak printer. - Excuse me, does Piers want to come back here and defend himself?
because it's really a pretty... you know,
you're making some pretty big statements over there.
you asked my opinion. I'm just telling you based on my opinion. - Ask Piers if he wants to come back to defend himself. - Yeah.
tell him I'm on my way.
so, what do you know about Piers?
what do you know about Piers?
you don't know Piers. - I think he's in the closet.
huh? - I think he's in the closet.
you're making some pretty big statements - You asked my opinion.
I'm just telling you based on my opinion. - Ask Piers if he wants to come back to defend himself. - Yeah.
tell him I'm on my way.
I just want to do one thing, Mr. Trump.
I just want to say, Trace, you're a beautiful cowboy.
What?! - Thanks very much, everyone.
need I say more?
I wasn't sure if he was gonna hit someone.
Oh, look, the hat comes off. - I wasn't sure if he was gonna hit someone back there. - Trace, nice head of hair.
very good. You look hip. - I actually thought I was gonna get hit.
I'm glad he gave him a kiss instead.
Oh...
sick. - Oh, my God.
Oh, that was too much. - You are too funny.
that's too much! - Well, you may as well, fight fire with fire. - Oh!
Oh!
that was rough!
trace looks a bit confused.
well, that was a pretty good defense.
actually, I fully understand what he's done.
and I think he's done-- - I don't.
I didn't understand that at all.
if you think about it, you're gonna understand it, Trace.
I think Trace is a little upset about that.
you didn't like that, did you?
that's the first time I've seen Trace shaken up a little bit.
it's all right. - He's a man's man.
everyone knows he's kidding. He was kidding.
all right?
never kiss a cowboy.
anything further to say, Stephen?
you have a Project Manager that started the day by saying, - "I lost at this event." - She did say that.
I don't know if that was a good thing to say, but you did start off by saying, "Oh, by the way, this was the event I lost two seasons ago."
it's okay.
it wasn't that I was thinking negative. I actually
if you would have won, it would have sounded good, but when you lose, it sounds doubly bad.
I wanted to turn it around... - Stephen, go ahead.
so, again, continuing with the truth, she said that she had lost at this very event in the past.
so, I don't lie.
I'm always telling the truth.
I never stab anybody in the back.
it's not what I believe in my faith.
I don't do it. I won't do it. I refuse to do it.
but I think if people are gonna start making accusations about who did or didn't do what,
I think it starts with the Project Manager.
trace, could you see me firing Stephen over Omarosa?
well, you know what? - Or could you see me firing both?
here again, this is one of those tasks that is just simply a numbers game.
I mean, because the people that I approached who were loyal patrons, or at least I was led to believe that they were patrons of this gallery, they didn't have any intention of buying anything.
they came in there to have a few glasses of wine, stumble around a little bit and look at the stuff and make an appearance, and that was about it, and then they'd leave.
and some of them didn't even bring money with them.
but didn't you sell two paintings? - I sold two paintings.
were these fans of yours? Did they know who you were?
well, yes, the lady did know who I was, and she's decorating her apartment here in the city, and I called her, and she bought a couple of things.
and that's all I sold.
I was disappointed in my performance today.
I thought I would be able to bring some more art lovers in.
but I don't know any of those people, but...
don, do you have any opinions?
it really is pretty cut-and-dry in terms of, you know, it's a loss.
I am disappointed in Stephen. I really thought the New York thing
I know if I want-- if I was participating in this task,
I could call 30 people that I could get
maybe not to spend a whole, you know, $165, 000, but I could get them to drop 5, 10 grand each, you know, for a total of something.
so to only sell $7, 000 worth of art is pretty bad.
so, I guess that's what's disappointing about Stephen.
Omarosa, I don't love the fact that you've been a three-time loser as Project Manager.
so, you know, I don't know what else there is to really say.
I think this is interesting because, Omarosa, you walked in here, and from the get-go, you looked so defeated.
I wasn't defeated. - And you put up a little bit of a fight.
you've hurled a few names around, almost halfheartedly, but I've never quite seen you like this.
and not once have you looked at my father and said, "This is why I shouldn't be fired."
no, I told him why, because I stepped up as the leader from the beginning.
but how can you say you've stepped up as a leader if you've lost three times, with this loss being your last?
I was taught something very young
I may not be the wealthiest woman in the room,
I may not be the smartest or the prettiest, but no one would outwork me.
and this whole process, I have outworked, committed myself to this process.
and even when I was... - - No, I outworked you, as well, love.
and you're not the smartest. You're definitely not the prettiest.
what was the other thing?
you know, what Ivanka said is a little bit true.
it's the first time I have seen you walk into a room where you felt and looked defeated.
Omarosa, you're the Project Manager. - Yes.
and you not only lost, you got creamed.
you know, I've always been a big Omarosa fan, but, Omarosa, you're fired. This was not close.
thank you for bringing me back. - Thank you very much.
thank you, Mr. Trump.
thank you.
well, that was pretty easy, to be honest.
Yeah. - That one was obvious.
the charity that I'm playing for is the Tomorrow's Aeronautic Museum's Positive Vibrations Program.
and it's for a bunch of really great kids.
I'd like to leave a few words to all the amazing celebrities that I had a chance to meet and Piers.
no man is your friend, no man is your foe, but every man is your teacher.
peace!
you're fired. - Yeah!
Omarosa has left the building!
tomorrow's a new day.
the celebries' smack down getting serious.
get going! - And will down to the final 5.
let's go! - Next Thursday
if you think Oma took all the celebrity with her.
remember, these two hate each other so much, they can taste it. - It's yummy, due.
all new Omaro
good morning. - Morning.
with only five celebrities left,
Mr. Trump forced them to rely on their wits.
you're going to go out and make some Quiznos sandwiches.
you're going to sell the sandwich for $2.
you cannot use your Rolodex.
the battle to make it to the final four began.
get going.
trace immediately took control for Empresario.
what kind of sandwich you want to make?
well, I think we ought to call it the Cowboy Club.
and on the street, his celebrity power became apparent.
you know who this guy is? Trace Adkins.
Oh, my God!
when you got a guy like Trace Adkins who's been surprising everybody, you put a little Stevie B. cherry on top, and it's yummy, dude.
on Hydra... - Champ Sandwich?
Ooh, that's a big one.
although Lennox was the Project Manager,
piers tried to call the shots.
the Champ Sandwich, right?
are you Program Manager here?
well, no. I'm suggesting to him.
do you want me to give good ideas or not, Carol?
and once again, Lennox served as Hydra's marketing tool.
all you have to do is have a product, put my face on it, and make me smile.
in the boardroom...
hydra sold 313 sandwiches.
hydra won by sheer volume sales.
Empresario, again you lose.
and Ivanka put Trace on the spot.
trace, who do you think is stronger and able to raise the most money for their charity in the tasks to come? - Me.
trace called out Stephen...
I've been working with Stephen for a good while now.
I haven't seen him bring in any money.
forcing Mr. Trump to look at Stephen's overall performance.
Stephen, you really didn't raise money over the last number of weeks.
moving forward, I just feel that Trace has more to offer.
Stephen, you're fired.
and Stephen was shown the door.
then the final four were given some shocking news.
we're going to continue this elimination process right now.
before the night is over, two of you will be fired.
10 celebrities have gone.
and now only four remain.
multiplatinum country star Trace Adkins, the original supermodel, Carol Alt...
hand on! Put it together!
heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis, and "America Got Talent" judge Piers Morgan.
they're battling it out for their favorite charities.
I'm gonna try and win this thing and get you a load more money.
but only one will win the ultimate title of the Celebrity Apprentice.
you are now going to be interviewed by two of the great business reporters anywhere
cnbc's Erin Burnett and "Mad Money's" Jim Cramer.
you're not going to find better business minds anywhere.
they're gonna speak to each one of you, and you're going to try and convince them why you should be the Celebrity Apprentice.
they're going to see me later.
they're gonna tell me their favorite, and they're gonna tell me their least favorite.
and then I'll decide who are the two contestants that get to compete for the title of the Celebrity Apprentice.
so, wait outside. Go have a good interview, because tonight, two more people will be fired.
okay, go ahead.
we were surprised.
within the next hour or two, two more people were gonna get fired.
we were gonna do personal, one-on-one interviews with Jim Cramer and Erin Burnett.
this is gonna really count a lot towards who makes the final two.
he's got to fire two more people.
how do you feel about being the chosen few, Trace?
I'm surprised.
I could see on their faces they were getting a bit nervous, and I was pretty confident, because the one thing I'm good at is talking.
so, my chances have probably gone from here to here.
let's get it on.
they're ready for you. You can go on in.
thank you, Annette.
okay.
how are you? - Fine, thank you.
good to see you tonight. - And you.
I want to talk to you a little bit about your charity.
it's called the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund.
it looks after and supports the servicemen.
my personal involvement is that my brother is an Army officer in Britain and has fought side by side with the U.S. Marines.
so, I have very personal involvement of the American military in relation to my family.
your charity is because of your daughter... food allergies?
Yes. Severe food allergies
she can go into anaphylactic shock, and we've been to the emergency room, you know, that frantic dash, five or six times.
it's a heartbreaking thing.
I've actually been to D. C. and lobbied on Capitol Hill to just make them more aware of things they can do and ways that they can safeguard these children.
we are basically gathering money and looking for deserving charities.
it might be pediatric AIDS this year.
it might be sudden infant death next year.
our charity doubled in just one year.
I want to see if we can triple it or quadruple it in the next year.
how will you use this great opportunity for the Ali Foundation, for the world?
um, what does this... um...um...
people have to feel that, you know, they want to, you know... you want
they want to give you money for your charity.
what was your best moment in this competition?
I was able to harness the energy of all the people in my team, and the creativity flowed.
it was almost easy.
playing myself to create excitement and for people to acknowledge that, "Yeah, the champ is here."
I will conclude my time on this show with my integrity intact.
do you think that being a bit mean might hurt your ability, in terms of getting other people to care and want to donate money?
well, I'm mean... I tend to be mean because of my commitment to the charity that I'm backing here.
I've raised probably three times as much as any other contestant on the show, and I want to win this.
I need some reasons to ax some other people.
trace and Lennox are slow when it comes to actually getting on the challenges.
I've just seen some people take advantage of other people and just... just rip them apart.
will you please give me a name?
well, that'd be Piers... Mr. Morgan.
trace has got to go.
I think I can raise a lot more money than he can.
I can outraise Lennox. I'm being honest here.
what have you learned from Mr. Trump?
how do I know that you really believe in this?
give me, also, a sense of what you did wrong when you won.
were you involved in the charities that they...
how much have you raised so far in this competition?
do you host fund-raisers?
have you exhausted your Rolodex?
so, what specifically will you do?
at any given time, didn't you want to just say, "I don't have to put up with this"?
what did you screw up on the worst in this competition?
I pretty well haven't made a mistake.
wow, that's amazing. You're probably the first person I've ever met in my career that's never made a mistake.
coming up, find out who will make it to the final two.
Erin, if you had to pick two, who would they be?
let's see how you did.
Hi, Erin. Hi, Jim.
what did you think?
I thought you had a pretty passionate crew there, Donald.
I was very impressed by how much each of them individually cared.
who did you like the least?
Piers. - Ah. Because of the edge.
he cared, certainly.
his family being involved in the war in Iraq
I mean, that was very inspiring to me.
but there was an edge there.
there was something that just didn't warm me up.
but the guy raises a lot of money.
if you want to make the most money, he's your man.
he will raise the most money.
do things like teamwork, leadership matter?
well, it always matters, I think.
well, then Piers must be stopped.
Jim, who do you like the best?
you can't go wrong with Carol.
I think she's -- - Is that because she's beautiful?
okay, she's a knockout.
I'm gonna stipulate knockout status. - She's stunning.
Carol was like a businessperson in there.
she sat there and said, "Here's my goals."
she could literally lay it all out.
I detected in her a quiet hunger. I mean
did you see that also with Lennox Lewis?
no. I d... I wanted to.
I wanted to come in here and tell you, "I want to go with Lennox,"
but I felt that he was too laid back for me.
did you think somebody was, like, outstanding?
trace is my favorite right now. - Ahh.
you know, if this guy went out and was raising money for something, and he said, "Erin, I want you to give money to this,"
I'd do it.
Jim, if you had to pick two, who would they be?
I'm going with Trace, and I'm going with Carol.
I think that they have the leadership, the bearing, and the integrity that you're looking for in a real leader.
Erin, if you had to pick two, who would they be?
you can go on in.
good luck, guys.
well, two people are going to go, but you've really all done an outstanding job, and you can be proud of yourselves.
it's been an amazing process.
so, congratulations, all four.
Lennox, what did you think of the interview with Erin Burnett and Jim Cramer?
I thought... I thought it was good.
you know, I'm used to those type of questions, and it's nothing that I was concerned about.
what did you think, Trace, of the interview process?
I liked speaking with Miss Burnett.
she seemed to be a very knowledgeable, smart lady.
and then Jim, uh... He, uh
you know, I mean, he's such a different person than I am.
I thought
do they have guys like Jim Cramer in the country?
not many that I know. - Not too many.
cause you're sitting there, and he's asking you a question, and it just sounds like, "Ehr rah rah,
you know, he's just rapid-fire, machine-gun-type stuff, and I'm trying to stay with him, but I felt like I was playing Ping-Pong with a world champ or something.
well, Erin thought you were terrific, I have to say.
do women generally think you're terrific?
Yes, sir.
that's a fast answer.
Piers, what did you think of the interview process?
in terms of the overall interviewing,
I felt I put a very strong position up.
but, you know, Jim and Erin thought... you were very harsh, Piers. - In what way?
they just thought you were very, very tough, very in-your-face, and I'm not saying that's right or wrong.
I'm surprised by that. I mean, I'm just direct.
maybe the word "ruthless" is the word that they used.
you've been called "ruthless" all your career.
Ruthless" just means tough in business.
I didn't break any rules.
I don't consider myself as some to be unethical or immoral.
that has nothing to do with it. To me, we're playing a tough game, where the beneficiary is the charities.
you seem to walk a line, though, that people aren't comfortable with.
and I don't think you've ever crossed boundaries and been unethical during this process, but there's something about the way you deal with situations that causes people to criticize you.
I've tried to play this game extremely hard because I believe that is the ethos that you would encourage us to play.
in the end, I believe the statistical evidence behind me is pretty overpowering.
if I am to lose because of my lack of British tact in a game which is led by a man who is renowned around the world for being a ruthless, tough businessman, then I plead happily guilty to that.
coming up, find out who will make it to the final two.
so, Carol? - Sir?
why should you be chosen to be in the final two, Carol?
I'm organized, I'm detailed, I'm versatile,
I can move on the fly, and I think I got the gumption.
you know your competitors very well.
you've been their teammates. You've been their opponents.
if you were me, who would you fire?
let's put it this way... I'd keep me and Piers.
and why wouldn't you choose Lennox, who's been a star?
I just think Piers always thinks ahead.
he thinks like I do.
he looks for, you know, problems ahead of time and the road ahead, and I like that.
Lennox couldn't win without me as often as he does.
anyone knew as much. He knows that.
I think he'd agree with that.
I could probably... - Do you agree with that, Lennox?
Yes, I do.
I wouldn't have answered it that way, Lennox.
I would have said, absolutely, "Who the hell do you think you are?
I would never admit that.
he's a good asset to the team.
I'm the main asset.
one of the greatest assets to the team.
and I've raised more money than everyone else put together.
he has. - Do you think he could win without you?
no. He's used me many times, and I feel I'm a great asset to him.
if you're asking me to be totally, brutally frank about the way the 11 challenges went,
I think if Lennox was being honest, he would say that I was the driving force for most of those challenges.
is that true, Lennox?
I would say because I was there, he was the driving force, because when he looked around and realized who was around that could help him, it was me.
Lennox, you've come across as a really smart guy, but you just said you would not have won so much if it weren't for Piers.
I, in one way, like that statement.
in another way... you understand
I don't like it. - Yeah. Right.
and the other element that has to play into my mind
I have great respect for Jim Cramer and great respect for Erin Burnett.
and they thought you were too laid-back, and they thought you should be fired.
and I have to say, Lennox, you're fantastic, but you're fired.
I accept that.
and you've done an amazing job.
thank you. - Go ahead.
thank you, Lennox. Fantastic guy.
Thanks, Lennox.
what's up, man?
the best part of this experience was I earned 40 grand for the Muhammad Ali Center.
the reason why I joined "The Celebrity Apprentice" was to make money for my charity, and I'm so happy that I was able to do so.
okay, so, one more of you is about to be fired.
trace, move over.
you know, it is very tough for me to fire Piers when he's won so much. We have to say that.
he's probably the least nice person, but at the same time... in terms of you.
Mr. Trump, I take exception to that.
I don't think you should.
people don't know much about me personally, too.
I don't think you should take exception, 'cause I've watched you over a lot of weeks.
Yeah, but people don't know... - and, you know,
when I'm stick it up for you, you shouldn't be cutting me off, to be honest with you. I'm saying good things about you.
I'm getting ready to sort of exonerate you.
okay, okay. - And instead of just sort of taking it, you start arguing. - Take "yes" for an answer.
I'll take my bullocking like a man.
I am gonna ask you a question.
you've known Carol. You've known Trace.
who would you fire, if you were me, if you can give me a straight answer?
Oh, I can. Straight answer... I would beat Trace with more ease than I would beat Carol.
she would be a tougher competitor, and I mean no disrespect to Trace, who is a great guy.
trace, why would I choose you to be in the finals, as opposed to the other two?
well, I'll give you 100%. I'll give you everything I've got.
I'll bring celebrities, and I'll do it in a spirit that there is no more noble cause.
I'll fight for my kid.
and I hope that I've played this game straight up, with integrity, and that's the way I wanted to play it, and that's the way I've that's the way I've played it.
do you like Piers?
we have been sociable and cordial to one another.
I don't know that we've developed any kind of tight bond.
do you see yourself inviting Piers to Nashville, to the Grand Ole Opry? - - No, sir.
why not? - I just
I've witnessed the way he's played the game.
and it's just... - He's played tough.
well, it's been a little more than tough at times.
it's been ruthless and merciless to a point.
somebody asked me if he'd stab you in the back, and I said, "Well, he'd stab you in the forehead," you know?
you'll see him coming.
Piers, how do you respond to that?
I've got no problem with that. I don't dispute any of that.
I would stab you in the forehead rather than the back.
I don't believe in going behind people's backs or pretending that I feel one thing and saying another.
in Trace's case, we're very different characters.
and, you know, he and I haven't always seen eye to eye, but he's a man of great respect and integrity.
Carol, how do I get over the fact that I want to see these two guys fight?
I have to tell you this
this even makes the decision harder for me, if it could be any harder, is that Erin and Jim Cramer thought that Piers should be fired, but he was the most effective guy.
they also thought you two were fantastic.
you were both their choices.
but I love the friction between these two guys, because I say they don't like each other.
Carol, I want to see these two guys go at it.
Carol, you're fired.
Oh, sir! - You did amazing. You did amazing.
you're fired. I want to see these two guys go at it.
I'm gonna see if you get country stars.
I'm gonna see if you get stars.
Carol, you are amazing. Get the hell out of here.
and as long as that's the reason I'm going, I'm okay with it. - You've done really, really well.
thank you very much. Thank you.
just to step forward and do this in the first place is really a big act of faith.
I accomplished everything I set out to do, so it made every task along the way a personal triumph.
firing Carol was not easy, but I love what I'm looking at.
to me, it's good versus evil.
it's the U. K. against the United States.
now, tomorrow we meet. I'll give you a task.
you'll fight like hell. Somebody will be fired.
somebody will be chosen the Celebrity Apprentice.
so, good luck. See you later.
thank you, sir.
you're going down, cowboy.
all right. You take your best shot.
it's all over.
nashville's gonna be crying by the end of this.
I'm gonna hang your British ass out in the street.
coming up...
my favorite royal... always has been.
I went to see Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.
we're gonna win it. We're gonna win it.
sorry. Everything we do, we have to win. - Of course.
here we go.
good morning, Piers. Good morning, Trace.
morning. - Good morning.
what do you think, Piers, about good versus evil and also U. S.A. against Britain?
I think I'm not as evil as you think, and he's definitely not as good.
well, Donald Trump was deliberately pitching the 6'7," all-American hero cowboy against the disgusting, obnoxious, evil Brit.
and, of course, all this was music to my competitive ears.
okay, what you're going to be doing is very exciting.
you're going to be holding a really grand charity event.
now, I think you need some help.
so, we've invited four really wonderful celebrities to come back.
come on out here, please.
look at this.
we brought back Carol Alt...
and Lennox Lewis.
all right, now, look
you're each going to choose two celebrities.
we'll decide who has first pick with a coin toss.
Piers, you have tails.
trace, you have heads. Good luck.
it's heads. Trace, you get the first pick. Who is it?
when I won the toss, I knew where I was going.
I was gonna take Piers' security blanket away from him, and that security blanket is Lennox Lewis.
how can a Brit fight for an American?
you don't want a Brit. - That's okay.
Piers, go ahead.
right. This is tough.
Oh, Lord, God, please, God.
Lord, please, Lord Jesus.
I'm gonna choose Stephen Baldwin.
Oh, God. Aah.
all right, Lord, what would Jesus do?
it's interesting that you chose Stephen.
the odd thing about Stephen is that, even though we clashed all the time, we actually work very well together.
well, I was very surprised by the pick.
who are you choosing, Trace?
my girl, Marilu Henner.
Piers, your final pick is Carol.
okay, for your final task, you're going to create a charity event right in this hall, and it's got to be spectacular.
you'll both have to work together to pull this off but will be responsible for different aspects of the event.
Ivanka, what will one finalist have to do?
well, one of you will handle catering, as well as produce the live-charity-auction events.
and, Don, for the other finalist?
well, the other finalist will be taking care of the decor, as well as working with the entertainment
multiplatinum recording artists the Backstreet Boys.
you'll be judged on three things
tickets sold to the event, money raised during the auction, and how well you run your part of the event.
we want this event to be huge, so we will provide you with some amazing auction items to get you started.
you will have to negotiate with each other to select which items you want.
Plus, you can add some of your own items to the auction.
and win or lose, the proceeds will go to your charity.
so, find great things to auction and sell as many tickets as you can.
everything I see and everything you do will help me decide who will become the Celebrity Apprentice.
thank you. - Thank you.
Hey.
the very first thing that we had to do was negotiate what part of the task each person was gonna be responsible for.
I'm making an assumption that you would feel more comfortable running the show?
you know why?
cause I think at this point, it's for the good of the event.
you are a music guy. You do shows.
I do charity auctions.
so, if you're happy,
I'll take the auction and the catering.
you guys take the show. - Right.
we want to keep a list.
if you got one, I'll write the stuff down.
it's gonna be I pick, you pick, I pick, you pick. - - Yes. That's fine, yeah.
we were given auction items that we had to negotiate with the other team, me and Trace.
and I looked through them very closely, worked out which ones I thought were the most viable for us.
you get to pick first. - Okay, I'll take Ivanka Trump.
okay. I'm taking 8, the Super Bowl thing.
okay. - What he take?
the Super Bowl thing. - Super Bowl, bruh!
my simple strategy was I was more interested in things that I thought could be quite appealing to a wider cross section of people, like the shopping trip with Ivanka Trump, and I was delighted.
I was really getting some stuff in that was really unique.
may the best man win, and I will.
you sure you guys really want to do that?
now I've got rid of you,
I've never been more certain of anything in my life.
Ohh!
you prat. - Just make sure you keep
make sure you keep him awake, yeah?
piers is a Chihuahua, man.
a Chihuahua is one of the tiniest dogs on the planet.
what I used to do is just nudge him occasionally.
they bark loud, and they make a lot of noise, and they're a pain in the ass, but they're no real threat.
that's Piers Morgan.
we're gonna win by selling our auction stuff to the highest bidder and selling the tickets for more than them.
by selling our auction stuff to the highest bidder and selling the tickets for more than them.
that's the game.
I have a feeling that faces are gonna matter, 'cause Trace is gonna have every country-music-star relationship that he has. - Sure, sure, sure.
I've warned Piers throughout this whole experience
it's not just about the money.
and he's looked me dead in my face and said, "Donald Trump is only interested "in the success we do as far as making money."
and I told Piers，I said, "I'm willing to bet you"
it would be my guess that you're very wrong about that.
we're gonna concentrate on celebrities, and we're gonna concentrate on the band and the decor.
I'm not gonna raise the kind of money that Piers is gonna raise.
piers is gonna beat me with the money.
I've already conceded that. That's gonna happen.
so, we're gonna concentrate on the other two areas, and if we can take two out of three, we win.
that's all there is to it.
I'm reaching out today to everybody that I have their phone number, that is in the same business that I'm in.
you want country people to come down to New York?
I'm chartering two jets, my friend...
to fly them up here.
are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious.
I want to win this thing, and I'm gonna beat this bastard, and I'm gonna beat him bad.
so, if we beat him with celebrities...
we win.
we need to get as much celebrities in the place as possible to win.
well, the key thing to winning this task was making sure that we had some good celebrities.
I would love for you to give me some numbers of some celebrities I can invite.
at this time, it's difficult to get celebrities because we're giving them, really, one day's notice.
anyone that you can think of or people that you could have just come to the event, even if they're just gonna bid?
Lennox is going after some celebrities,
Marilu Henner's going after a few, and I've got to get some.
I need cowboy hats.
so, I started calling people, man, you know?
I know every country-music artist, and I was able to get a few.
I've got Montgomery Gentry.
I've got Ronnie Milsap, Dean Sams from Lonestar.
I was also trying to get some auction items that was gonna raise money through an auction to benefit our two charities.
I've got Bob sending two Taylor guitars, and I was gonna have any of my celebrities that show up sign the guitar, we auction it off, okay?
it was... It was unbelievable.
so, you're going to the prop-rental place.
so, that's all good.
Marilu and Lennox headed off now to go look at stuff from the props house,
I was dealing with the band, making sure that all that was taken care of.
me and Marilu actually went to the prop house today to pick out some stuff so that when people come for the event tomorrow, this place is looking good and sexy.
Hey. Hi. - Hey.
are you Peter? - That's me.
Hi. It's so nice to meet you. Marilu Henner.
nice to meet you. - Hi, Lennox. Pleasure.
I love planning parties.
I always think in terms of flow, energy centers, et cetera, et cetera.
do we make them all high, or do we make them all low? - Yeah, we want them high.
we want them high. - I agree.
Yeah. done.
I think we should have the mixture of high and low, a few chairs, and then some chairs around.
I want to see the linens.
let me -- I just want to see white, just for my sake.
whatever you'd like. - So, that's that.
that's how it'll look.
good. That looks good. I like that. Done.
okay, but remember, we're on a time limit.
so, you got to get through it fast.
I know. I know. - Okay.
I know. - So, once we come up with something
boom! We decide it, done. - That's great.
Marilu kind of reminds me of, you know, my mother.
she's kind of, like, a little bit fussy.
she wants to get everything right.
and I have to go in there and say, "Okay, this is what we're doing. That's it. Done. Move on.
I'm just worried about having a bunch of ugly gold chairs and silver chairs.
okay. - I say keep it just like that.
Yeah. - Done.
I'm worried about looking tacky. That's the whole thing.
no... - I feel safer with this
that's not tacky at all. - all black.
I think that looks great.
done! - Okay.
okay. - Done.
let's go. - Let's go.
all right. This was fun. - Peter, thanks a lot.
okay, thank you so much, Peter.
I'll check in with you tomorrow. - Thanks. OK, great.
I think you guys did a great job.
great. Thank you. - Okay. Wonderful.
Ahhh... Thanks.
done! - Okay.
Hi. How are you? - Hi. Carol Alt.
nice to see you. - Nice to see you. My pleasure.
stephen Baldwin. - Stephen, how are you?
nice to meet you, as well. - You too.
Oh, you've already set up some great stuff for us. - Yeah. We decided to prepare some hors d'oeuvres for you.
Carol and I went and met the organization that was providing the food and the drinks.
and we did a little taste testing of the hors d'oeuvres.
yummy. - Okay.
this is the actual hors d'oeuvre that will be served.
okay. - May I?
Yes, please indulge.
we have some smoked salmon, and we have the miso-glazed seared tuna.
Ooh la la.
and then we have pattypan squash that's filled with a braised short rib ragu.
Oh, my Lord.
can I just pig out? - Absolutely. Feel free.
we'll, um, get that to you.
is that loud? - That's loud.
Stephen... he's extremely charming.
he's very cute.
I think I could eat about 27 of those.
it's catering. He's a piece of work.
I've got to win the auction.
the auction's a major part of this challenge.
I knew that I had to get creative prizes with great uniqueness to them.
just on a whim, I thought, "I wonder if my old friend is in New York."
right. What can I do for you, then, Piers?
your Majesty. - Yeah, that's all right.
keep it quiet. - How are you?
nice to see you. - Come and sit down.
what, don't I get a kiss?
of course you get a kiss. Of course you do.
my favorite royal... always has been.
no. You need bring out a bit more eager.
I went to see Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.
she was on great sparkling form.
I need your help with something. - Right. Okay.
I'm running a big charity event tomorrow night. - Right.
the great thing about Fergie is that not only is she great fun and incredibly enthusiastic, she loves working with charity.
look, what we can do
I can do tea, - Yes.
and then we can also give a Wedgwood tea set.
you're the draw. - No!
I'll go along and
fergie offered herself up as a prize
tea with the Duchess, a royal tea, which is great.
now we're gonna win it. We're gonna win it.
sorry. Everything we do...
we have to win. - Of course.
I thought, "That is a slam dunk."
I really appreciate it. - Not at all.
that one moment may be enough to win the auction.
you owe me!
what else do we need to do?
should we go through the Backstreet Boys' checklist or anything that you...
aren't the Backstreet Boys like "Backstreet Old Guys" now?
are they still using "Boys"?
Backstreet Gray Hairs.
I was a little nervous about the Backstreet Boys' list of everything they wanted in their dressing room.
we also need 12 bottles of assorted local beers, two bottles of red wine... Cabernet and Merlot
one hot-tea setup with honey and fresh lemon.
just hold up. I need to talk to their road manager first.
a lot of times, the road manager will tell you, "Man, they don't need all that stuff.
Oh, okay, 'cause it was on my list.
I'm gonna talk to their tour manager when he hits the ground.
he's gonna call me, and I'm gonna kind of go over it with him and just cause I've done this a lot...
a million times. - And it most like, Look
I'm gonna discuss with their tour manager the stuff that they have on their list, on their rider, stuff they want in the greenroom.
what, if it's too much trouble to find, can be lived without?
and as an act, it's at that point that you have to decide, "Is this a deal breaker for me?
if I don't have green M&M's in the room, "am I not gonna go onstage"?
Hello?
Hello, is this Fitzjoy? - Fitzjoy.
this is Trace Adkins. Uh, h-hello?
say again. What's your name?
my name is Trace Adkins. I am your liaison.
what's your name? - My name is Trace Adkins
what's your function?
trace was getting a little frustrated because, you know, it's a big event for him.
he doesn't need to be running around, looking after all the different things that maybe a boy band wants.
okay. 9: 30 we'll leave the hotel.
we'll be there. - In the morning at 10: 00 a. m.
okay. Bye. - Bye.
so, a lot of these questions here about them
I'll have answered in the morning when I meet with them at 10: 00.
I'm not really comforted about the way the dude sounded on the phone.
no.
Oh, God.
Hi, I'm Piers. - Piers, very nice to meet you.
how are you? Good to see you.
Lisa came down from Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, their representative, and we had a great meeting.
I've had another idea. - Okay.
why don't we give twenty ticktes to wounded veterans. - Yeah, okay.
I think it would be really powerful to have your guys there as our invited guests. - Okay.
and I'm aware, by doing this,
I'm giving up tickets I could have sold.
but I actually think that Mr. Trump will find that, perhaps, is in the spirit of the game.
a mixture of old and young and probably 2/3 young.
I thought that would add a really nice touch to the event.
they'd see the uniform, they'd think about our heroic soldiers, and it might encourage them to bid higher sums of money.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.
thank you so much for what you're doing.
I just want
if I win, you get more money.
OK, Exactly, and that's what we like, right?
okay, exactly. - Take care. Thank you.
just for the record, you don't care how mean I am, do you?
no. The meaner, the better. Right?
you go get 'em, Piers.
Hey.
Hi, Trace?
how's it going? - How're you doing?
trace Adkins. - How you doing, man?
Nick Carter. - Nice to meet you, Nick.
Hey. Howie Dorough.
I had to go have a meeting with Backstreet Boys, to let them know, "I'm gonna be the guy today taking care of you, "whatever your needs may be.
I'm gonna fulfill this rider, whatever.
I got to tell you straight up front, though
on your rider, it talks about two different dressing rooms.
this is not a big venue. We've got one room backstage.
so, since we only have the one room, some of the stuff on this rider is redundant.
you know what I'm saying?
you've got stock for two rooms here, so...
if you want two of everything, you got two of everything. But
well, if we're gonna have our band in there with us, we might... - Yor're gonna need
you're gonna have to have -- - Fine.
we'll leave it that way, then. - All right.
I knew then I was dealing with a group of kids that were gonna just bust my balls all day.
can I ask you wheatgrass
is there any way you can get that? - Excuse me?
wheatgrass. - Wheatgrass?
Yeah. - Like, to eat?
what you do is you squeeze it, and you get the juice out of it, and you drink it.
it's like really good for your body. - It looks like a sod of turf.
yeah - What?
are you punking me, man? Is this a joke? Really?
no, I've never heard of it, man.
I just... I don't know... maybe.
it gives you energy right before you go on stage.
I'm happy for you, brother.
I'm glad you found something that works for you.
if you could leave the waters out, and
so they're room temperature. - Yeah, room temperature.
with leaves... - You know.
even, like, some tea would be great.
talking to the Backstreet Boys is time out of my life that I'll never get back.
talking about wheatgrass juice.
I've already established you have about as much fund-raising ability inside you as an armadillo, so I'm relying on you for faces.
while I gave the charity 20 tickets, it's down to Stephen to deliver on the celebrity count.
stephen had promised me a lot of celebrities.
you tell Gandolfini that it's me, too.
Where's Lindsay? - She's in L. A.
Ben Stiller's not available.
he's a great character.
but his biggest flaw is, in terms of celebrity getting, he just, unfortunately, is fairly useless.
okay. It sounds like it's a little too complicated.
Bye.
I believe in delegation.
you have to believe these people can deliver on what they say they can do.
Hello? Hello?
Oh, boy.
look, look, the bottom line is
are there any celebs you think you could get down here, realistically?
I looked.
it was a bit depressing, to be honest, and I thought if Trace turns up with a carload of country-music superstars and
Lennox brings in all the big fight boys, we might have a bit of a problem.
where is Stephen? - I don't know.
this is what he does, unfortunately.
well, yes, I was responsible for getting as many celebrities there, but realistically, with such short notice, nobody was available.
so, if Piers gets fired because no celebrities showed up...
sorry.
next week, the final showdown continues, and Trace is tested by the band...
black nail polish?
one of them forgot to bring his fingernail polish.
while Piers lays down his plan of attack.
the general strategy tonight is to get them as loaded as fast as possible, all right?
loaded celebrities means lots of money.
thank you very much. - All right.
and with everything hanging in the balance,
trace gets an emotional visit...
it reminded me why I'm doing this for that 6-year-old.
while Piers gets a phone call that surprises everyone.
you may recognize the voice.
tune in next week to find out who will become the Celebrity Apprentice.
good morning. - Morning.
with only five celebrities left,
Mr. Trump forced them to rely on their wits.
you're going to go out and make some Quiznos sandwiches.
you're going to sell the sandwich for $2.
you cannot use your Rolodex.
the battle to make it to the final four began.
get going.
trace immediately took control for Empresario.
what kind of sandwich you want to make?
well, I think we ought to call it the Cowboy Club.
and on the street, his celebrity power became apparent.
you know who this guy is? Trace Adkins.
Oh, my God!
when you got a guy like Trace Adkins who's been surprising everybody, you put a little Stevie B. cherry on top, and it's yummy, dude.
on Hydra... - Champ Sandwich?
Ooh, that's a big one.
...although Lennox was the Project Manager,
piers tried to call the shots.
the Champ Sandwich, right?
are you Program Manager here?
well, no. I'm suggesting to him.
do you want me to give good ideas or not, Carol?
and once again, Lennox served as Hydra's marketing tool.
all you have to do is have a product, put my face on it, and make me smile.
in the boardroom...
hydra sold 313 sandwiches.
...Hydra won by sheer volume sales.
Empresario, again you lose.
and Ivanka put Trace on the spot.
trace, who do you think is stronger and able to raise the most money for their charity - in the tasks to come? - Me.
trace called out Stephen...
I've been working with Stephen for a good while now.
I haven't seen him bring in any money.
...forcing Mr. Trump to look at Stephen's overall performance.
Stephen, you really didn't raise money over the last number of weeks.
moving forward, I just feel that Trace has more to offer.
Stephen, you're fired.
and Stephen was shown the door.
then the final four were given some shocking news.
we're going to continue this elimination process right now.
before the night is over, two of you will be fired.
10 celebrities have gone.
and now only four remain.
multiplatinum country star Trace Adkins, the original supermodel, Carol Alt...
hand on! Put it together!
...heavyweight boxing champion Lennox Lewis, and "America Got Talent" judge Piers Morgan.
they're battling it out for their favorite charities.
I'm gonna try and win this thing and get you a load more money.
but only one will win the ultimate title of the Celebrity Apprentice.
you are now going to be interviewed by two of the great business reporters anywhere
cnbc's Erin Burnett and "Mad Money's" Jim Cramer.
you're not going to find better business minds anywhere.
they're gonna speak to each one of you, and you're going to try and convince them why you should be the Celebrity Apprentice.
they're going to see me later.
they're gonna tell me their favorite, and they're gonna tell me their least favorite.
and then I'll decide who are the two contestants that get to compete for the title of the Celebrity Apprentice.
so, wait outside. Go have a good interview, because tonight, two more people will be fired.
okay, go ahead.
we were surprised.
within the next hour or two, two more people were gonna get fired.
we were gonna do personal, one-on-one interviews with Jim Cramer and Erin Burnett.
this is gonna really count a lot towards who makes the final two.
he's got to fire two more people.
how do you feel about being the chosen few, Trace?
I'm surprised.
I could see on their faces they were getting a bit nervous, and I was pretty confident, because the one thing I'm good at is talking.
so, my chances have probably gone from here to here.
let's get it on.
they're ready for you. You can go on in.
thank you, Annette.
okay.
how are you? - Fine, thank you.
good to see you tonight. - And you.
I want to talk to you a little bit about your charity.
it's called the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund.
it looks after and supports the servicemen.
my personal involvement is that my brother is an Army officer in Britain and has fought side by side with the U. S. Marines.
so, I have very personal involvement of the American military in relation to my family.
your charity is because of your daughter -- food allergies?
Yes. Severe food allergies
she can go into anaphylactic shock, and we've been to the emergency room, you know, that frantic dash, five or six times.
it's a heartbreaking thing.
I've actually been to D. C. and lobbied on Capitol Hill to just make them more aware of things they can do and ways that they can safeguard these children.
we are basically gathering money and looking for deserving charities.
it might be pediatric AIDS this year.
it might be sudden infant death next year.
our charity doubled in just one year.
I want to see if we can triple it or quadruple it in the next year.
how will you use this great opportunity for the Ali Foundation, for the world?
um, what does this -- um...um...
people have to feel that, you know, they want to, you know -- You want
they want to give you money for your charity.
what was your best moment in this competition?
I was able to harness the energy of all the people in my team, and the creativity flowed.
it was almost easy.
playing myself to create excitement and for people to acknowledge that, "Yeah, the champ is here."
I will conclude my time on this show with my integrity intact.
do you think that being a bit mean might hurt your ability, in terms of getting other people to care and want to donate money?
well, I'm mean -- I tend to be mean because of my commitment to the charity that I'm backing here.
I've raised probably three times as much as any other contestant on the show, and I want to win this.
I need some reasons to ax some other people.
trace and Lennox are slow when it comes to actually getting on the challenges.
I've just seen some people take advantage of other people and just -- just rip them apart.
will you please give me a name?
well, that'd be Piers -- Mr. Morgan.
trace has got to go.
I think I can raise a lot more money than he can.
I can outraise Lennox. I'm being honest here.
what have you learned from Mr. Trump?
how do I know that you really believe in this?
give me, also, a sense of what you did wrong when you won.
were you involved in the charities that they...
how much have you raised so far in this competition?
do you host fund-raisers?
have you exhausted your Rolodex?
so, what specifically will you do?
at any given time, didn't you want to just say, "I don't have to put up with this"?
what did you screw up on the worst in this competition?
I pretty well haven't made a mistake.
wow, that's amazing. You're probably the first person I've ever met in my career that's never made a mistake.
coming up, find out who will make it to the final two.
Erin, if you had to pick two, who would they be?
let's see how you did.
Hi, Erin. Hi, Jim.
what did you think?
I thought you had a pretty passionate crew there, Donald.
I was very impressed by how much each of them individually cared.
who did you like the least?
Piers. - Ah. Because of the edge.
he cared, certainly.
his family being involved in the war in Iraq
I mean, that was very inspiring to me.
but there was an edge there.
there was something that just didn't warm me up.
but the guy raises a lot of money.
if you want to make the most money, he's your man.
he will raise the most money.
do things like teamwork, leadership matter?
well, it always matters, I think.
well, then Piers must be stopped.
Jim, who do you like the best?
you can't go wrong with Carol.
I think she's -- - Is that because she's beautiful?
okay, she's a knockout.
I'm gonna stipulate knockout status. - She's stunning.
Carol was like a businessperson in there.
she sat there and said, "Here's my goals."
she could literally lay it all out.
I detected in her a quiet hunger. I mean
did you see that also with Lennox Lewis?
no. I d-- I wanted to.
I wanted to come in here and tell you, "I want to go with Lennox,
but I felt that he was too laid back for me."
did you think somebody was, like, outstanding?
trace is my favorite right now. - Ahh.
you know, if this guy went out and was raising money for something, and he said,"Erin, I want you to give money to this,
I'd do it.
Jim, if you had to pick two, who would they be?
I'm going with Trace, and I'm going with Carol.
I think that they have the leadership, the bearing, and the integrity that you're looking for in a real leader.
Erin, if you had to pick two, who would they be?
you can go on in.
good luck, guys.
well, two people are going to go, but you've really all done an outstanding job, and you can be proud of yourselves.
it's been an amazing process.
so, congratulations, all four.
Lennox, what did you think of the interview with Erin Burnett and Jim Cramer?
I thought -- I thought it was good.
you know, I'm used to those type of questions, and it's nothing that I was concerned about.
what did you think, Trace, of the interview process?
I liked speaking with Miss Burnett.
she seemed to be a very knowledgeable, smart lady.
and then Jim, uh -- He, uh
you know, I mean, he's such a different person than I am. I thought
do they have guys like Jim Cramer in the country?
not many that I know. - Not too many.
cause you're sitting there, and he's asking you a question, and it just sounds like, "Ehr rah rah, "rah rah rah, rah rah rah!
you know, he's just rapid-fire, machine-gun-type stuff, and I'm trying to stay with him, but I felt like I was playing Ping-Pong with a world champ or something.
well, Erin thought you were terrific, I have to say.
do women generally think you're terrific?
Yes, sir.
that's a fast answer.
Piers, what did you think of the interview process?
in terms of the overall interviewing,
I felt I put a very strong position up.
but, you know, Jim and Erin thought - you were very harsh, Piers. - In what way?
they just thought you were very, very tough, very in-your-face, and I'm not saying that's right or wrong.
I'm surprised by that. I mean, I'm just direct.
maybe the word "ruthless" is the word that they used.
you've been called "ruthless" all your career.
"ruthless" just means tough in business.
I didn't break any rules.
I don't consider myself as some to be unethical or immoral.
that has nothing to do with it. To me, we're playing a tough game, where the beneficiary is the charities.
you seem to walk a line, though, that people aren't comfortable with.
and I don't think you've ever crossed boundaries and been unethical during this process, but there's something about the way you deal with situations that causes people to criticize you.
I've tried to play this game extremely hard because I believe that is the ethos that you would encourage us to play.
in the end, I believe the statistical evidence behind me is pretty overpowering.
if I am to lose because of my lack of British tact in a game which is led by a man who is renowned around the world for being a ruthless, tough businessman, then I plead happily guilty to that.
coming up, find out who will make it to the final two.
so, Carol? - Sir?
why should you be chosen to be in the final two, Carol?
I'm organized, I'm detailed, I'm versatile,
I can move on the fly, and I think I got the gumption.
you know your competitors very well.
you've been their teammates. You've been their opponents.
if you were me, who would you fire?
let's put it this way -- I'd keep me and Piers.
and why wouldn't you choose Lennox, who's been a star?
I just think Piers always thinks ahead.
he thinks like I do.
he looks for, you know, problems ahead of time and the road ahead, and I like that.
Lennox couldn't win without me as often as he does.
anyone knew as much. He knows that.
I think he'd agree with that.
I could probably-- - Do you agree with that, Lennox?
Yes, I do.
I wouldn't have answered it that way, Lennox.
I would have said, absolutely, "Who the hell do you think you are?
I would never admit that.
he's a good asset to the team.
I'm the main asset.
one of the greatest assets to the team.
and I've raised more money than everyone else put together.
he has. - Do you think he could win without you?
no. He's used me many times, and I feel I'm a great asset to him.
if you're asking me to be totally, brutally frank about the way the 11 challenges went,
I think if Lennox was being honest, he would say that I was the driving force for most of those challenges.
is that true, Lennox?
I would say because I was there, he was the driving force, because when he looked around and realized who was around that could help him, it was me.
Lennox, you've come across as a really smart guy, but you just said you would not have won so much if it weren't for Piers.
I, in one way, like that statement.
in another way -- you understand
I don't like it. - Yeah. Right.
and the other element that has to play into my mind
I have great respect for Jim Cramer and great respect for Erin Burnett.
and they thought you were too laid-back, and they thought you should be fired.
and I have to say, Lennox, you're fantastic, but you're fired.
I accept that.
and you've done an amazing job.
thank you. - Go ahead.
thank you, Lennox. Fantastic guy.
Thanks, Lennox.
what's up, man?
the best part of this experience was I earned 40 grand for the Muhammad Ali Center.
the reason why I joined "The Celebrity Apprentice"was to make money for my charity, and I'm so happy that I was able to do so.
okay, so, one more of you is about to be fired.
trace, move over.
you know, it is very tough for me to fire Piers when he's won so much. We have to say that.
he's probably the least nice person, but at the same time -- in terms of you.
Mr. Trump, I take exception to that.
I don't think you should.
people don't know much about me personally, too.
I don't think you should take exception, 'cause I've watched you over a lot of weeks.
Yeah, but people don't know -- - And, you know,
when I'm stick it up for you, you shouldn't be cutting me off, to be honest with you. I'm saying good things about you.
I'm getting ready to sort of exonerate you.
okay, okay. - And instead of just sort of taking it, - you start arguing. - Take "yes" for an answer.
I'll take my bullocking like a man.
I am gonna ask you a question.
you've known Carol. You've known Trace.
who would you fire, if you were me, if you can give me a straight answer?
Oh, I can. Straight answer -- I would beat Trace with more ease than I would beat Carol.
she would be a tougher competitor, and I mean no disrespect to Trace, who is a great guy.
trace, why would I choose you to be in the finals, as opposed to the other two?
well, I'll give you 100%. I'll give you everything I've got.
I'll bring celebrities, and I'll do it in a spirit that there is no more noble cause.
I'll fight for my kid.
and I hope that I've played this game straight up, with integrity, and that's the way I wanted to play it, and that's the way I've -- that's the way I've played it.
do you like Piers?
we have been sociable and cordial to one another.
I don't know that we've developed any kind of tight bond.
do you see yourself inviting Piers to Nashville, - to the Grand Ole Opry? - No, sir.
why not? - I just
I've witnessed the way he's played the game.
and it's just -- - He's played tough.
well, it's been a little more than tough at times.
it's been ruthless and merciless to a point.
somebody asked me if he'd stab you in the back, and I said,"Well, he'd stab you in the forehead," you know?
you'll see him coming.
Piers, how do you respond to that?
I've got no problem with that. I don't dispute any of that.
I would stab you in the forehead rather than the back.
I don't believe in going behind people's backs or pretending that I feel one thing and saying another.
in Trace's case, we're very different characters.
and, you know, he and I haven't always seen eye to eye, but he's a man of great respect and integrity.
that I want to see these two guys fight?
I have to tell you this
this even makes the decision harder for me, if it could be any harder, is that Erin and Jim Cramer thought that Piers should be fired, but he was the most effective guy.
they also thought you two were fantastic.
you were both their choices.
but I love the friction between these two guys, because I say they don't like each other.
Carol, I want to see these two guys go at it.
Carol, you're fired.
Oh, sir! - You did amazing. You did amazing.
you're fired. I want to see these two guys go at it.
I'm gonna see if you get country stars.
I'm gonna see if you get stars.
Carol, you are amazing. Get the hell out of here.
and as long as that's the reason I'm going, - I'm okay with it. - You've done really, really well.
thank you very much. Thank you.
just to step forward and do this in the first place is really a big act of faith.
I accomplished everything I set out to do, so it made every task along the way a personal triumph.
firing Carol was not easy, but I love what I'm looking at.
to me, it's good versus evil.
it's the U. K. against the United States.
now, tomorrow we meet. I'll give you a task.
you'll fight like hell. Somebody will be fired.
somebody will be chosen the Celebrity Apprentice.
so, good luck. See you later.
thank you, sir.
you're going down, cowboy.
all right. You take your best shot.
it's all over.
nashville's gonna be crying by the end of this.
I'm gonna hang your British ass out in the street.
coming up...
my favorite royal -- always has been.
I went to see Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.
we're gonna win it.
sorry. Everything we do, - we have to win. - Of course.
here we go.
good morning, Piers. Good morning, Trace.
morning. - Good morning.
what do you think, Piers, about good versus evil and also U. S.A. against Britain?
I think I'm not as evil as you think, and he's definitely not as good.
well, Donald Trump was deliberately pitching the 6'7," all-American hero cowboy against the disgusting, obnoxious, evil Brit.
and, of course, all this was music to my competitive ears.
okay, what you're going to be doing is very exciting.
you're going to be holding a really grand charity event.
now, I think you need some help.
so, we've invited four really wonderful celebrities to come back.
come on out here, please.
look at this.
we brought back Carol Alt...
and Lennox Lewis.
all right, now, look
you're each going to choose two celebrities.
we'll decide who has first pick with a coin toss.
Piers, you have tails.
trace, you have heads. Good luck.
it's heads. Trace, you get the first pick. Who is it?
when I won the toss, I knew where I was going.
I was gonna take Piers' security blanket away from him, and that security blanket is Lennox Lewis.
how can a Brit fight for an American?
you don't want a Brit. - That's okay.
Piers, go ahead.
right. This is tough.
Oh, Lord, God, please, God.
Lord, please, Lord Jesus.
I'm gonna choose Stephen Baldwin.
Oh, God. Aah.
all right, Lord, what would Jesus do?
it's interesting that you chose Stephen.
the odd thing about Stephen is that, even though we clashed all the time, we actually work very well together.
well, I was very surprised by the pick.
who are you choosing, Trace?
my girl, Marilu Henner.
Piers, your final pick is Carol.
okay, for your final task, you're going to create a charity event right in this hall, and it's got to be spectacular.
you'll both have to work together to pull this off but will be responsible for different aspects of the event.
Ivanka, what will one finalist have to do?
well, one of you will handle catering, as well as produce the live-charity-auction events.
and, Don, for the other finalist?
well, the other finalist will be taking care of the decor, as well as working with the entertainment
multiplatinum recording artists the Backstreet Boys.
you'll be judged on three things
tickets sold to the event, money raised during the auction, and how well you run your part of the event.
we want this event to be huge, so we will provide you with some amazing auction items to get you started.
you will have to negotiate with each other to select which items you want.
Plus, you can add some of your own items to the auction.
and win or lose, the proceeds will go to your charity.
so, find great things to auction and sell as many tickets as you can.
everything I see and everything you do will help me decide who will become the Celebrity Apprentice.
thank you. - Thank you.
Hey.
the very first thing that we had to do was negotiate what part of the task each person was gonna be responsible for.
I'm making an assumption that you would feel more comfortable running the show?
you know why?
cause I think at this point, it's for the good of the event.
you are a music guy. You do shows.
I do charity auctions.
so, if you're happy,
I'll take the auction and the catering.
you guys take the show. - Right.
we want to keep a list.
if you got one, I'll write the stuff down.
it's gonna be I pick, you pick, - I pick, you pick. - Yes. That's fine, yeah.
we were given auction items that we had to negotiate with the other team, me and Trace.
and I looked through them very closely, worked out which ones I thought were the most viable for us.
you get to pick first. - Okay, I'll take Ivanka Trump.
okay. I'm taking 8, the Super Bowl thing.
okay. - What he take?
the Super Bowl thing. - Super Bowl, bruh!
my simple strategy was I was more interested in things that I thought could be quite appealing to a wider cross section of people, like the shopping trip with Ivanka Trump, and I was delighted.
I was really getting some stuff in that was really unique.
may the best man win, and I will.
you sure you guys really want to do that?
now I've got rid of you,
I've never been more certain of anything in my life.
Ohh!
you prat. - Just make sure you keep，make sure you keep him awake, yeah?
piers is a Chihuahua, man.
a Chihuahua is one of the tiniest dogs on the planet.
what I used to do is just nudge him occasionally.
they bark loud, and they make a lot of noise, and they're a pain in the ass, but they're no real threat.
that's Piers Morgan.
we're gonna win...
by selling our auction stuff to the highest bidder and selling the tickets for more than them.
that's the game.
I have a feeling that faces are gonna matter, 'cause Trace is gonna have every country-music-star - relationship that he has. - Sure, sure, sure.
I've warned Piers throughout this whole experience
it's not just about the money.
and he's looked me dead in my face and said, "Donald Trump is only interested "in the success we do as far as making money.
and I told Piers -- I said, "I'm willing to bet you"
it would be my guess that you're very wrong about that.
we're gonna concentrate on celebrities, and we're gonna concentrate on the band and the decor.
I'm not gonna raise the kind of money that Piers is gonna raise.
piers is gonna beat me with the money.
I've already conceded that. That's gonna happen.
so, we're gonna concentrate on the other two areas, and if we can take two out of three, we win.
that's all there is to it.
I'm reaching out today to everybody that I have their phone number, that is in the same business that I'm in.
you want country people to come down to New York?
I'm chartering two jets, my friend...
...to fly them up here.
are you serious? - Yes, I'm serious.
I want to win this thing, and I'm gonna beat this bastard, and I'm gonna beat him bad.
so, if we beat him with celebrities...
we win.
we need to get as much celebrities in the place as possible to win.
well, the key thing to winning this task was making sure that we had some good celebrities.
I would love for you to give me some numbers of some celebrities I can invite.
at this time, it's difficult to get celebrities because we're giving them, really, one day's notice.
anyone that you can think of or people that you could have just come to the event, even if they're just gonna bid?
Lennox is going after some celebrities,
Marilu Henner's going after a few, and I've got to get some.
I need cowboy hats.
so, I started calling people, man, you know?
I know every country-music artist, and I was able to get a few.
I've got Montgomery Gentry.
I've got Ronnie Milsap, Dean Sams from Lonestar.
I was also trying to get some auction items that was gonna raise money through an auction to benefit our two charities.
I've got Bob sending two Taylor guitars, and I was gonna have any of my celebrities that show up sign the guitar, we auction it off, okay?
it was-- It was unbelievable.
so, you're going to the prop-rental place.
so, that's all good.
Marilu and Lennox headed off now to go look at stuff from the props house,
I was dealing with the band, making sure that all that was taken care of.
me and Marilu actually went to the prop house today to pick out some stuff so that when people come for the event tomorrow, this place is looking good and sexy.
Hey. Hi. - Hey.
are you Peter? - That's me.
Hi. It's so nice to meet you. Marilu Henner.
nice to meet you. - Hi, Lennox. Pleasure.
I love planning parties.
I always think in terms of flow, energy centers, et cetera, et cetera.
do we make them all high, - or do we make them all low? - Yeah, we want them high.
we want them high. - I agree.
Yeah. done.
I think we should have the mixture of high and low, a few chairs, and then some chairs around.
I want to see the linens.
let me -- I just want to see white, just for my sake.
whatever you'd like. - So, that's that.
that's how it'll look.
good. That looks good. I like that. Done.
okay, but remember, we're on a time limit.
so, you got to get through it fast.
I know. I know. - Okay.
I know. - So, once we come up with something
boom! We decide it, done. - That's great.
Marilu kind of reminds me of, you know, my mother.
she's kind of, like, a little bit fussy.
she wants to get everything right.
and I have to go in there and say, "Okay, this is what we're doing. That's it. Done. Move on."
I'm just worried about having a bunch of ugly gold chairs and silver chairs.
okay. - I say keep it just like that.
Yeah. - Done.
I'm worried about looking tacky. That's the whole thing.
no... - I feel safer with this
...that's not tacky at all. - all black.
I think that looks great.
done! - Okay.
okay. - Done.
let's go. - Let's go.
all right. This was fun. - Peter, thanks a lot.
okay, thank you so much, Peter.
I'll check in with you tomorrow. - Thanks. OK, great.
I think you guys did a great job.
great. Thank you. - Okay. Wonderful.
Ahhh... Thanks.
done! - Okay.
Hi. How are you? - Hi. Carol Alt.
nice to see you. - Nice to see you. My pleasure.
stephen Baldwin. - Stephen, how are you?
nice to meet you, as well. - You too.
Oh, you've already set up some - great stuff for us. - Yeah. We decided to prepare some hors d'oeuvres for you.
Carol and I went and met the organization that was providing the food and the drinks.
and we did a little taste testing of the hors d'oeuvres.
yummy. - Okay.
this is the actual hors d'oeuvre that will be served.
okay. - May I?
Yes, please, indulge.
we have some smoked salmon, and we have the miso-glazed seared tuna.
Ooh la la.
and then we have pattypan squash that's filled with a braised short rib ragu.
Oh, my Lord.
can I just pig out? - Absolutely. Feel free.
we'll, um, get that to you.
is that loud? - That's loud.
stephen -- he's extremely charming.
he's very cute.
I think I could eat about 27 of those.
I've got to win the auction.
the auction's a major part of this challenge.
I knew that I had to get creative prizes with great uniqueness to them.
just on a whim, I thought, "I wonder if my old friend is in New York."
right. What can I do for you, then, Piers?
your majesty. - Yeah, that's all right.
keep it quiet. - How are you?
nice to see you. - Come and sit down.
what, don't I get a kiss?
of course you get a kiss. Of course you do.
my favorite royal -- always has been.
no. You need bring out a bit more eager.
I went to see Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.
she was on great sparkling form.
I need your help with something. - Right. Okay.
I'm running a big charity event - tomorrow night. - Right.
the great thing about Fergie is that not only is she great fun and incredibly enthusiastic, she loves working with charity.
look, what we can do
I can do tea, - Yes.
and then we can also give a Wedgwood tea set.
you're the draw. - No!
I'll go along and ???
fergie offered herself up as a prize
tea with the Duchess, a royal tea, which is great.
now we're gonna win it. We're gonna win it.
sorry. Everything we do...
...we have to win. - Of course.
I thought, "That is a slam dunk."
I really appreciate it. - Not at all.
that one moment may be enough to win the auction.
you owe me!
what else do we need to do?
should we go through the "Backstreet Boys" checklist or anything that you...
aren't the Backstreet Boys like "Backstreet Old Guys" now?
are they still using "Boys"?
Backstreet Gray Hairs.
I was a little nervous about the "Backstreet Boys" list of everything they wanted in their dressing room.
we also need 12 bottles of assorted local beers, two bottles of red wine -- Cabernet and Merlot
one hot-tea setup with honey and fresh lemon.
just hold up. I need to talk to their road manager first.
a lot of times, the road manager will tell you, "Man, they don't need all that stuff."
Oh, okay, 'cause it was on my list.
I'm gonna talk to their tour manager when he hits the ground.
he's gonna call me, and I'm gonna kind of go over it with him and just
cause I've done this a lot...
a million times. - ...and it most like,"Look
I'm gonna discuss with their tour manager the stuff that they have on their list, on their rider, stuff they want in the greenroom.
what, if it's too much trouble to find, can be lived without?
and as an act, it's at that point that you have to decide, "Is this a deal breaker for me?
if I don't have green M&M's in the room, "am I not gonna go onstage?"
Hello?
Hello, is this Fitzjoy? - Fitzjoy.
this is Trace Adkins. Uh, h-hello?
say again. What's your name?
my name is Trace Adkins. I am your liaison.
what's your name? - My name is Trace Adkins
what's your function?
trace was getting a little frustrated because, you know, it's a big event for him.
he doesn't need to be running around, looking after all the different things that maybe a boy band wants.
okay. 9: 30 we'll leave the hotel.
we'll be there. - In the morning at 10: 00 a. m.
okay. Bye. - Bye.
so, a lot of these questions here about them
I'll have answered in the morning when I meet with them at 10: 00.
I'm not really comforted about the way the dude sounded on the phone.
no.
Oh, God.
Hi, I'm Piers. - Piers, very nice to meet you.
how are you? Good to see you.
Lisa came down from Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, their representative, and we had a great meeting.
I've had another idea. - Okay.
why don't we give twenty tickets to...
wounded veterans. - Yeah, okay.
I think it would be really powerful to have your guys there - as our invited guests. - Okay.
and I'm aware, by doing this,
I'm giving up tickets I could have sold.
but I actually think that Mr. Trump will find that, perhaps, is in the spirit of the game.
...a mixture of old and young and
probably 2/3 young.
I thought that would add a really nice touch to the event.
they'd see the uniform, they'd think about our heroic soldiers, and it might encourage them to bid higher sums of money.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too.
thank you so much for what you're doing.
I just want
if I win, you get more money.
OK, Exactly, and that's what we like, right?
okay, exactly. - Take care. Thank you.
just for the record, you don't care how mean I am, do you?
no. The meaner, the better. Right?
you go get 'em, Piers.
Hey.
Hi, Trace?
how's it going? - How're you doing?
trace Adkins. - How you doing, man?
Nick Carter. - Nice to meet you, Nick.
Hey. Howie Dorough.
I had to go have a meeting with Backstreet Boys, to let them know, "I'm gonna be the guy today taking care of you, "whatever your needs may be.
I'm gonna fulfill this rider, whatever.
I got to tell you straight up front, though
on your rider, it talks about two different dressing rooms.
this is not a big venue. We've got one room backstage.
so, since we only have the one room, some of the stuff on this rider is redundant.
you know what I'm saying?
you've got stock for two rooms here, so...
if you want two of everything, you got two of everything. But
well, if we're gonna have our band in there with us, - we might-- - Yor're gonna need
you're gonna have to have -- - Fine.
we'll leave it that way, then. - All right.
I knew then I was dealing with a group of kids that were gonna just bust my balls all day.
can I ask you -- wheatgrass
is there any way you can get that? - Excuse me?
wheatgrass. - Wheatgrass?
Yeah. - Like, to eat?
what you do is you squeeze it, and you get the juice out of it, and you drink it.
it's like really good for your body. - It looks like a sod of turf.
yeah -- - What?
are you punking me, man? Is this a joke? Really?
no, I've never heard of it, man.
I just -- I don't know -- maybe.
it gives you energy right before you go on stage.
I'm happy for you, brother.
I'm glad you found something that works for you.
if you could leave the waters out, and
so they're room temperature. - Yeah, room temperature.
with leaves... - You know.
even, like, some tea would be great.
talking to the Backstreet Boys is time out of my life that I'll never get back.
talking about wheatgrass juice.
I've already established you have about as much fund-raising ability inside you as an armadillo, so I'm relying on you for faces.
I'm pulling out all the guns here.
while I gave the charity 20 tickets, it's down to Stephen to deliver on the celebrity count.
stephen had promised me a lot of celebrities.
you tell Gandolfini that it's me, too.
Where's Lindsay? - She's in L. A.
Ben Stiller's not available.
the thing about Stephen is, he's full of life all the time.
he's a great character.
somebody help me!
Jesus!
Darl? Come on in, I 'll scramble you some eggs.
so say...
you haven 't seen my keys, have you?
why did you do that for? -I love you.
good morning, Lauren. -Hi, Katie.
Hey, Darl, you sure were shaking your petootie last night.
come here a minute, honey. -Why?
just come here, okay?
how old are you? -21 and got an l. D. to prove it.
poor shit!
advice for you: go to Crawfish Bay or wherever you 're from.
work in a place like this and you are going to develop bad habits.
you've got a booger on your nose. -lt 's Rhonda.
Darl, it 's C. B. -I 'm not here.
he said something about a truck wreck.
put down the shoes, Al. -I 've got 6 kids...
put down the shoes, Al.
Hey, C. B. -lt 's a whole situation.
Yeah, it looks like it. Pass me that umbrella.
have you seen my sunglasses? -I don 't think so.
do me a favor and look for them, will you?
some marketing! How you doing, Bud?
the driver said some woman ran in front of him.
did you talk to her? -No. Couldn 't find her.
can 't find her? I 'll be darned.
what 's up, buddy? Whose dog is this?
his license and title were clean, but his insurance lapsed.
is that right?
are you hurt, son?
are you alright? -Yeah, sir, I 'm alright.
dumped her in there, didn 't you? -Yes, sir.
sure did. I nearly rolled over.
listen, I don 't know where you drive through...
but in Louisianayou can 't drive around with no insurance.
I tried to keep it up. I got to feed my kids though.
Yeah, I get you. -Yes, sir.
it 's an awful lot of shoes.
I 'll give you a breathlizer test. That 's all there is to it.
hell, no, I ain 't no drunk! You find that woman. It 's her fault!
C. B. make the call, will you?
this is Rhonda. -Rhonda, it's C. B.
we got high tops. Want some? -You best save me a pair.
pot Goose 's.
I appreciate it, C. B!
and what they 're building right down the road...
is a gambling casino that will destroy...
truck wreck on 65. Darl 's giving out free shoes.
you cannot bring in Las Vegas' style of gambling!
I bet you US$ 1 million it fits that girl.
Hey, Goose, what 's up, buddy? You're drunk yet?
sir, this is the Lord's day. Jack Daniels got to wait till midnight.
are you ason now?
they're tasty. Just clean them up. I'm just cleaning the mud.
that 's a7 medium, so... So, Cletus.
you see, you got to say the magic words, okay?
who are you going to vote for? -Well, you, sheriff.
Ornelle, planning on pulling that thing out with that truck?
before I start, I got to get it right: who do I send the bill to?
judge executive pays the bills. -Hey, Darl!
you ought to look at this!
what? -There 's awoman out here.
and she ain 't moving.
damn, she 's good looking, huh?
anybody knows her? -No.
nice if I did!
charge him for man slaughter? -I don 't know, maybe.
there 's a camera under my seat, C. B. Get it and take pictures.
Jesus. -Amen. She 's a believer.
good grief, little feller. You 're about to get squashed!
now run. Run like the wind!
how you doing, sister?
looks good. I didn't think God would let a miss work on Sunday.
I have to be open for business before the casino is.
I 'm trying to identify this gal. You haven't seen her, have you?
no, she doesn 't come to my church.
I guess you wouldn 't know her, would you?
say, Henry? -Ain 't playing much football.
hell, no.
help me out with something. Have you seen this little sweetheart?
she is a looker. -Yes. She 's got hit by a truck.
I heard that. I don 't know her. Your money is no good here.
my wife picked out hush puppies. -They fit?
good deal. Thanks for your help. -Okay, Darl.
hear anything, let me know. -Sure will. Hey, Darl...
those kids out front, please run them off. I 'm getting complaints.
all right. See you later, Henry.
that 's dangerous! You little shits will have to get out of here.
you're running off all of Henry's customers.
what are you just standing there for? Get in the car. What 's wrong?
you come with me. -Why?
because I said to. Come on. -Come on, let 's just go.
your mom doesn 't let you smoke. -Not in front of her.
who 's this? -I 'm trying to find out.
so how 's school, honey?
amazing.
that 's good.
can I get a tattoo?
a tattoo of what? -Gaia.
what 's Gaia? -Gaia, the earth goddess.
when I was a kid, the girls who had a tattoo worked in tit shows.
don't walk around like trash. -Thanks.
C. B. to BigT-One. You copy? We're over at the doc's.
you got to see this. -See what, C. B?
damn, Squeegee. -Wait until you see this!
you ain 't supposed to be in here. -You just wait.
what 's going on?
she 's got a pecker. -And teeties.
don 't say that, C. B. Jesus! -She 's got a bigger dick than I do.
squeegee, I 'll have to take your word on that.
Oh, Lord!
you call it a "transvestite." -Technically...
because of the hormone induced breasts, she 's a "transsexual."
a transvestite just likes to dress up.
an accident? -No.
this is the copper that killed her, or him.
22 caliber, shot to the back and lodged in the chest cavity.
feet are cut up, so... I feel she ran a long way with this in her.
the actual time of death probably just 45 minutes ago.
asphyxiation. Lungs slowly filled up with the blood.
damn, Darl. She was alive while we were unloading those shoes.
identifiable markings: Jesus as a tattoo...
but this here, that 's a stamp, like you 'd get in a nightclub.
homicide. You should 've called investigators before moving her.
excuse me, Mrs. District Attorney, I was called for the accident.
I didn 't have any idea... -Wow! That 's cool!
what? Get back in the car! -She 's riding back with me. Come.
what?
I wish to hell she hadn 't proposed to me. It would 've been easier.
lt 's my fault you 're miserable. -That 's what I said.
you 're getting any alimony? -I should. Put her through school.
doc, won 't you put some over this. I always love this bit.
those goodies look so real. -They are real. What do you think?
they 're not exactly real. They 're weren 't real. They 're real now.
they sure are pretty. -Hey, cut that out.
seems you know a lot about this. -I 've read a lot. I 'm sorry.
I just read a lot. -I don 't know what the deal is.
we don 't want to know what 's going on...
behind closed doors. -Stop that.
I 'm going back to the desk. Want me to call the State forensics?
Why? -Carlasaid we should 've done it.
I don 't give a rat 's ass. Call in the State boys on a Sunday...
to investigate a "homocide"? They don 't give a shit.
have you seen my sunglasses?
no.
shit!
good morning, Lana, how you doing? Is the judge home?
he 's out back.
take the Baby Bear. Mr. Grandpa Bear. He 's got a tie on.
you 've got your hands full. -Daughter thinks I 'm a babysitter.
I have done nothing to dissuade her of that notion.
we have a policy problem with Darl I should let you know about.
that D. O.A.
Darl doesn't want to call in the State investigation unit.
Darl can be mule-headed.
he should've checked with me before stealing those shoes.
I mean it 's been years since Darl has handled a murder case.
the first 48 hours are crucial.
some crime investigations don 't deserve the tax payer 's money.
this is one of them. -I beg your pardon?
having the wrong kind of publicity in Le Salle at the wrong time.
with the casino pendent? -I know we shot it...
but, right now, Darl just might be the best man for the job.
pretty precious!
I missed you. I was just gone for a minute and I missed you.
good grief! Darlene, this milk stinks!
there 's creamer in the cupboard. -I don 't like that powder shit.
this lady... She would like to speak to asheriff or a deputy.
Hi. My name is Darl. Pleased to meet you.
are you the sheriff? -Yeah.
except I don 't use my gun unless the charm fails, you know?
I 'm worried about a friend of mine.
you 're not from here, are you? -Why do you say that?
because you look better than the people around here.
no. I drove up from New Orleans. -How 's everything down there?
it 's fine. You get down there much?
if I got a good reason, I go down there every now and then.
Yeah, I 'm worried about my girlfriend. She called me...
Saturday from Le Salle. I haven 't heard from her since.
this might not have anything to do with it, I don 't know...
but did she happen to have a...
a what?
it 's... A Jesus tattoo?
where are we going?
across the street.
full name? -Mona.
Mona what? -She just had one name.
I felt something was wrong. What happened?
got shot. We found her at aswamp.
who did it? -I don 't have a clue. Do you?
listen, this sex question over here is a little problem.
what box should I check? -However you like.
alright, both boxes.
next keen? -Me.
are you like her sister or something like that?
I 'm her wife.
legal? -Legal.
I 'm sorry, I just... I never really... Hey!
I 'm sorry, but it 's strange for me. I don 't see it every day.
ma'am, this is a murder case.
I 'll have to ask you some more questions, so...
ask!
what was she, or he... -She!
alright, what was she doing in Le Salle?
Mona called our house on Saturday night and left a message...
around 3.
she said...
she was working in a Christmas party in Le Salle and...
her ride left her stranded and in the morning she would catch a bus.
Sunday came and she didn't come home.
monday I started to worry. I called everybody...
nobody heard from her.
last night, I drove up here.
that 's it. That 's all I know.
where was this party at? -I don 't know.
she 's an entertainer, she performs a lot of parties.
what was she driving? -Doesn 't have a license nor a car.
where did she call you from?
I don 't know.
how about this Jesus tattoo she had on her? What 's that about?
a few years ago, she went through this religious phase...
she got this tattoo. Jesus over her heart.
what about that stamp on her hand, that J. A? What 's that?
"johnny Angels," a nightclub in New Orleans where we work.
both of you work there?
are you the same as she is, you know?
what does that have to do with my husband being murdered?
C. B. what do you want? -Sorry, but we got an emergency.
there 's a protest at the casino site and...
your daddy 's got a shotgun. -Of course he has.
would you mind waiting in my office? I got to take care of this.
get back here!
this was to a be a nice protest. Nobody invited him to show up.
you hear me?
he won 't let me near him.
he 's going to kill somebody. -Hey, it 's me! Put the gun down!
I 've seen better sheriffs in Saturday morning cartoons!
there he is, God himself. Mr. Own lt, Mr. Buy lt.
well, these raisins ain 't for sale!
bull, you stupid drunk, put that gun down!
stay back! He 's crazy! -All bark and no bite!
flatter than yesterday 's beer.
you are gone. There 's nothing left.
I 'm a dangerous man. I 'm a killer!
if you were to kill me, you 'd have killed me a long time ago.
give me that gun.
get him out of my site. -Come on, daddy. Get up.
get off this hill, damn it. What are you doing shooting at things?
I don't believe it would do any good to lock him up. Do you?
how are you coming with that freak murder?
we made an l. D. She came from New Orleans.
I figured. All shit that floats ends up in New Orleans.
that 's for sure.
Darl, I don 't want you to make too much noise with that case.
I 'd hate to have the newspapers stick the words Le Salle parish...
and transsexual murder in the same headline.
I hear you.
see if you can talk some sense into that alcohol soaked head.
all right.
that son of a bitch! That judge's a tad wacker, that 's what!
he's brought up every land this side of the lake, except mine.
and I'll fry in hell before I sell out to that son of a bitch!
no, sir, not for Fort Knox!
when he asked for my badge, I thought "how bad can that be"?
it 's only a piece of tin. I didn 't realize that that badge...
was my skin. It held me together. Don't let him do that to you.
don 't have to worry about me. -I don 't.
your brother took the wrong turn. Took after your momma.
but you are me.
big chief to station 1. -Station 1.
tell that Scarlet person to go back to New Orleans. I 'm tied up.
she 's left already. But she wasn 't going back to New Orleans.
she said she was going by the bus station...
see if anybody had seen her husband. Over.
all right.
I use 2 sticks of butter. No more, or it doesn 't taste right.
Plus, it puts pounds on you. -I think I could use a few pounds.
sheriff? Can I help you? -How you doing?
all right. -I was looking for somebody.
she was looking for somebody too.
then we got to discussing shortbread recipes...
sorry I couldn't help you with your friend. I'll keep an eye out.
thank you. -Sure. Who are you looking for?
I think I know where to find them.
all right.
I thought I told you to wait for me at the office...
thought I could help. It turns out Mona never bought a bus ticket.
Yeah, well... Okay...
that 's you right there? -What 's your sign?
your astrological sign?
Capricorn.
stubborn.
selfish and stubborn.
I'll handle everything from here. Just go back to New Orleans...
look, you think that Mona belongs in a Petri dish...
but you 're wrong. Monawas the best person I ever met.
the gentlest person. Never put on errors, kind to everyone.
you think that 's easy, the choice that she made in her life?
it isn 't. She 's the bravest person I 've ever met.
so, you put your prejudice aside...
and swear to me you 're going to find out who did this.
okay, we'll handle that, right off the bat. That 's what we 'll do.
ho, ho, Paradise Casino has got to go!
I want 3 of whatever those deals are.
you look lovely. -Thank you.
you bought that dress in N. Y? -New Orleans, right off the rack.
you 're charming. -How are you?
great, thanks. -The governor is here.
we all know about your politics. Come give us a bit of that guitar.
come on and give us... -Come on up here!
come up here! -Come on, governor!
play something nice!
for God 's sake!
Darl, where are you going?
I don 't want to listen to that son of a bitch try to play the guitar.
what do you care? -C. B. I was just being nice.
Hey, hey, ho, ho, Paradise Casino has got to go!
Hey, hey, ho, ho, Paradise Casino has got to go!
Hey, Darl! Hi!
Darl, those asshole mother fuckers won 't let us in their damn party.
get back in the car! -Who 's that you 're with?
nobody. -I 'm leaving. You coming?
does it look like I 'm coming?
Hey, there, listen. Behave now, all right?
I always behave. -You 're not doing a good job.
that 's not his daughter, is it?
there you go. Hi, everybody.
this is... -Party hardy girl.
my friend Hannah.
Hey, I know you from the Tavern. -How you doing?
this must be the husband you 're always running down.
Hey, I told you to behave.
let 's hear it for the governor!
Thanks. I want to talk a couple of minutes about Le Salle parish.
not like my opponent, Hart Burnson, or as I call him...
heartburn, son!
he 's marching marionettes right outside that door.
paradise Casino has got to go!
you know me?
no, I don 't think so. -You tried to fuck me.
I own a picking pan in Shreeport. This is ashipping invoice.
you stole US$ 2O, OOO worth in my shoes.
I don't know anything about it. -My driver says you were there.
well, your driver ought to be a better driver, you know what?
my brother-in-law is the attorney general. He 'll rip you a new one.
I don 't know who you think you are, but this ain 't Shreeport.
so you'd better keep your finger out of my face!
Burnson doesn't want jobs for you.
you know what? They're going to vote you off the ticket.
did they tell you yet?
good party, judge. Darl, how are you doing?
you're cutting me off the ticket? -Where did you get that idea?
don 't bullshit me. -Easy, Darl.
you easy! Get your fucking hands off of me!
you 're embarrassing yourself. -Don't fuck with me in my parish!
you need to calm down, hear me? -Get your nose out of his ass!
always good to see you, Darl. -You too, governor.
thanks for coming. Merry Xmas. -Merry Christmas to all of you.
what is everybody looking at? Just enjoy yourselves. Shit!
home, sweet home.
what are you doing?
what did you do, girl?
some girls are spitters, but I 'm aswallower.
I guess I 'll carry you.
where are you going to take me? Where are we going?
take off my boots.
Hello?
sheriff? -Who is this?
scarlet. Did I wake you?
I got the number Mona called from. It 's on my new phone bill.
you got a pencil? -Yeah, I got one.
okay, it's 294-3672.
got it?
Icalled there a bunch of times. Nobody ever answers.
this is kind of late.
I don 't know what to do with her things.
have you ever lost anybody close?
Yeah.
I 'm sorry.
so, good night. -Good night.
Hey, Carla. Listen...
I said some pretty ugly things last night.
I made a fool out of myself. -Yes, we all remember very well.
I remember pretty well. I 'm very sorry.
she 's watching us, so let 's be civil with each other.
what are you doing for Christmas? Drive up to your momma's?
no, because I only get a day off. It 's too far to drive.
she won 't speak to you. At least try to do that.
Yeah, I guess not.
Darl, there were a lot of phone calls made about you last night.
phone calls don 't scare me. -lf you heard them, you 'd be.
watch your back.
let me make a deal with you: invite me over for Christmas.
I'll bring a tree, a turkey and fruit cake. We 'll have a big...
you think you can act like an ass, show up and everything be fine?
you don 't get off for free. You 're a cop, you should know.
if you want to come over in the afternoon to see Ashley, fine.
there 's a party in Baton Rouge I'm going to.
is that right?
I bet the governor will be there. -Move your car.
Hey, judge.
let 's just get right to the point.
if you're taking some heat, I'll call the governor right now.
last week I visited an elementary school and I saw this girl...
on a computer talking to Kazakhstan.
I'm not smart to know where it is, but I know things are changing.
what was good enough for Le Salle parish 1O, 2O years ago...
I don't have a clue what you're talking about! Not a fucking clue!
well, there it is, in a nutshell.
the party is running Jackson for sheriff.
ls that right? -That 's right.
well, I'm running. If I have to run against you and the party.
your father tried that once with very little success.
don't talk about my father, okay?
you and him both can kiss my ass!
that's exactly it. -Excuse me, it 's real quick.
Lucy, I need that voter petition for elective office.
all right. Thanks, honey.
sure, Darl, I 'll sign. You 're a good man.
I 'll tell that to everybody.
always good to see you, Darl.
you told all sorts of lies to get elected. They 'll all catch you.
what do you say, Goose? -I 've already signed for Jackson.
I understand. -Sorry, Darl.
keep trash of my parking lot. -You got it, Henry.
I really appreciate it.
Ornelle...
you 're going to go blind looking at that nookie.
I'm looking for my car catalogue.
he's been looking for it for half an hour.
I need you to sign something for me. What 's wrong with him?
Hey, sister, are you going to sign for me?
well, what are your views about the State supporting gambling?
what does it have to do with it? -Well, our governor...
who coverts with harlots on the Sabbath, our sheriff steals shoes.
come to think of it, I think Jackson might be the better man.
know what I'm beginning to think? That I liked you a lot better...
when you smoked all that reefer and went fucking in your Pinto.
the Lord's arms are big enough to embrace all who've fallen down.
I think you'd better get with it. -So you're not going to sign it?
there were a lot of phone calls made about you last night.
watch your back.
red light usually means "stop"! -Goddamnit!
you little shits stay out of the road, you understand me?
I don 't think I can keep my shoes. Scarlet called 3 times.
did you know Jackson is running this year?
well?
Yeah, I heard. -C. B. I gave him his job.
and you know damn well that he 's going to get all the black vote.
I don't know what he said, but his deputy will come from swamp town.
I need you on my side.
I found your sunglasses, Darl, on the back seat of my wife 's car.
Hello? Sheriff 's office.
I 've done everything you 've ever asked of me...
haven 't l?
Darl, it 's that Scarlet person again.
pulled a fast one, did he? I told you. It was just a matter of time.
he did it, you know? -Who did what?
killed that freak. -You mean the judge?
who else? Nobody squeezes ashit without his thumb prints in it.
he's running the nigger to fill your slot. What will you do?
I didn't raise you to roll over, buddy boy.
why don't I just bitch and moan and soak myself to death?
let the record show I never missed one day at work. Not one, no sir!
go ahead, run, you son of a bitch!
come on, boy! Come on!
come here, buddy! All right. Feeding the little doggies?
how 's it going, Cletus? -Good.
is it about 8 days till hunter season?
Yes. It 'll be in about 8 days. -Was that dog at the wreck?
Yes, sir. That 's Buster there.
he must have heard the breaks squealing. Busted loose.
Hey, Darl!
you look lost. -I walked in from the highway.
how are you all guys doing?
Hey, sheriff, what you got there?
it 's ashoe I found in the woods. It might belong to that freak.
I thought you weren't so interested in that case.
well, I'm getting more interested in it.
you have a party Saturday? -Why are you asking?
I don 't know. I guess I thought I might get invited to it.
you 're not a member. -Hey, sheriff...
when you catch him, you 'll lock him up or give him a medal?
I don 't know. I haven 't decided it yet.
good seeing you. Don't be bitten by snakes walking in the woods.
I'll try.
Hey, Marcus! What are you doing in my car?
Darl Hardwick, move over to the car, place your hands on the roof.
I don 't know what you 're talking about. For what? Taking shoes?
statutory rape. -What are you talking about?
the girl you brought to the party was fifteen.
I didn 't touch her. -That's not what she said.
I don 't give ashit to what... -Darl!
let me see your gun and up with your hands.
here 's my hands up.
what are you going to do? Right. Excellent.
you marginal piece of shit! Up against the car!
what are you looking at, Marcus? You're some kind of friend, huh?
I can get in the fucking car. -Get in there!
Hey! Hey!
it smells like shit in here!
Oh, man!
here goes this up.
I'm recusing myself from the case.
we're bringing in another prosecutor.
Carla, I didn't do anything to that little girl.
they must 've paid her off to lie about me. That 's all l...
I read her deposition. You 'll need a really good lawyer.
I 'm happy to make some recommendations.
they're trying to push me out, that 's all this is about.
the freak case can hurt them. -I read her birth certificate.
she was fifteen.
everybody saw you leaving with her. She 's Ashley 's age.
you just live in your own play pen with your own rules, don 't you?
I can 't shop without people looking at me like I 'm pathetic.
I'm not pathetic, you're pathetic!
I married a good man...
but these last several years I 've been miserable.
where did you go?
it was aset up. I can prove it.
we dropped to a lesser charge, attributed to delinquency.
throw out the statutory rape.
and you get out on 12months probation.
Darl, I 'm trying to keep you out of jail.
for a cop, it 's a felony offense.
I 'll piss away my law enforcement career.
I saw you serve that girl drinks. That 's against the law.
the condition is you can 't leave the parish without permission.
Howdy. Need a ride? -A ride with who?
gizmo. I play a zodiacal accordion on an anti-gambling website...
and I 'm a good friend of your good friend sister Felicia.
this is Mark, my unpaid intern.
that party at Tidewater. I heard a rumor the governor was there.
they say in Louisiana politics the only way you can get reelected...
if you get caught with a dead girl or a live boy.
our governor 's done the combo. -You work for Burnson?
who I work for is not as important as getting out the truth.
you know the State police moved your D. O.A. to Baton Rouge?
records on the case were sealed. -I 've been kind out of the loop.
I heard.
you possess aspecial gift, Darl.
I'm talking about the ability to bring politicians to their knees.
I can help you get even.
I don't need any help.
it 's a rough league, bubba. Sooner or later...
at this level, everybody needs help.
can you tell me where a bar named Johnny Angels is?
you wouldn 't know where a place called Johnny Angels is.
us$ 5. Only US$ 5. I 'll read your tarot.
so, is he dead?
no. Not officially, no.
have you come in to do a little Christmas shopping?
I'm on a case. I thought you might know where Johnny Angels is.
you're a little out of your jurisdiction, aren't you, sheriff?
nice place you've got, though.
this is Luna, my partner.
this is Darl.
my, my, the sheriff!
Oh, we 've heard about you. -Well, I 'm not asheriff anymore.
there 's astory right there.
any freak on the street can tell you where Johnny Angels is.
why did you come in here, Darl?
well, it is Christmas, you know?
so I thought I'd just come by and say...
maybe say you 're sorry?
see if you were alive.
y 'all got a lot of diseases. -How considerate of you.
good to know you haven 't changed a bit.
canal and Belvedere Street. Green door behind awarehouse.
merry Christmas, Darl. -Yeah, Merry Christmas.
Hey, gorgeous, look at you. -Watch the nails.
what 's in the bag?
lt 's a shoe. -Let 's see.
nice.
a stamp, like you 'd get in a nightclub.
Hello, cowboy.
you're my little flower
flower, flower
Irememberwhen
you were in my hands
time falls like a shower
when lsee you, flower
there's a place where grace
willtake me to you
I' ll breathe
through you
flower, fly -Nice job, sugar. -Thank you so much.
that was great, darling. -Thanks.
Hey, sheriff. -I 'm not a sheriff anymore.
Why? They caught you with your fingers in the cookie jar?
I 'm being set up for investigating the murder of your husband.
that 's funny. I can't even get you to return my phone calls.
watch it! -What 's your problem, faggot?
say you made a mistake! -Relax, buddy!
listen, I 'm breaking my parole to talk to you.
what do you want? A star on your forehead? A round of applause?
did this belong to Mona?
no. -Are you sure?
I 'm sure.
get the fuck out of the way!
stop!
stop!
what? -I found out where the party was.
Tidewater.
two years ago, a girl who worked in here was beaten to death...
with a tire iron, right here, on the side of this wall.
and the cops told me to my face that she deserved it!
if I help you, will you go all the way with this?
this is about real justice for Mona.
so that 's her shoe back there?
it 's mine. We wore the same size.
Darl, could you hold my lipstick? My pocket 's got a hole.
what 's happening, little momma? Good to see you.
haven 't been here for awhile. -We 're going to hop in and out.
this is my friend Darl. -What 's happening, Darl?
you think you could comp him? -Comp? It will cost you sugar.
it 's okay. Just tell him what you told me.
I got friendly with a guy in Baton Rouge.
I won't tell you who. It's not in my best interest.
once a month he pays us to put on a lingerie show in Le Salle.
it 's a deal. You ain't got to do nothing you don 't want to.
some girls make dates to make extra cash.
I 'm not that greedy. -At the Tidewater?
lt 's okay. He needs to know. -I 'll never say this in court.
we finished up our show, counted up our tips and we 're leaving.
it 's 2: 15. I always check to see how long the ride back takes.
we almost ran over her. She was walking awayfrom the club.
I really didn 't even know it was Mona until you told me, sweetie...
that it was in Le Salle that she was found.
and the governor was there?
we 're well paid to say "no" to that question.
well, I hate to see a pretty woman standing all alone.
you didn 't answer my question.
what question was that? -What 's the deal with Darl?
you know more about his situation than I do. It is a local matter.
somebody paid that girl.
if it wasn't her, it 'd be the next. Or the drinking or the graft.
you know he wouldn't have done anything that hadn't been done.
are you telling me you want me to turn the clock back?
18. 5% of my appointments have been to women and minorities.
nowadays, asmart, qualified woman like you...
has a place in Louisiana public service.
but not Darl.
so how could Mona model lingerie?
you saw her, brownie. She had the body for it.
no, I don 't mean that. I mean...
when the big Cadillac bump in the road there you might notice.
here's how you do it, Darl: you tuck it in between your legs...
and put on a little G-string.
all right...
so what 's next, inspector?
the phone number Mona called you from, do you have that?
did you lose it? -It's in a file at the office.
well, I know it by heart. I memorized it.
maybe you'll have better luck.
are all the girls here lesbians? -Well, some of them.
now, you see the worst side of men working here.
so you worked here?
Yeah. Tips are good, money is good.
so do you have to do that tuck in job yourself, I mean...
Darl, it 's eating you up, isn 't it?
Hello? Is this Tidewater? -No, I don't think so.
this is Darl Hardwick. Who am I speaking to?
Darl, it 's me. -Me who?
you got the phone booth out front my place.
Darl, I have never been paid for that shoe truck job.
I am not the sheriff anymore. I can't do anything about it.
Iain't got no shoes either. Everybody got new shoes...
I don 't got no new shoes.
We'lltalk later about it. Iwant to askyou something important;
do you know that D. O.A we found at the swamp?
she made a callfrom your phone booth at 3 am. Didyou see her?
Sundays I don 't open till 8.
excuse me, I need to run your credit card.
Ornelle, listen, I 've got to get going.
Bye-bye.
I ain 't getting no new shoes.
tell me something personal. -You don 't want to hear that.
no... No...
my daddy is a crazy drunk.
well, like father, like son. -I 'm not either.
I drink like everybody else does, you know?
what about your momma? -I never really knew her.
she died when I was pretty young.
my daddy didn 't know how to take care of kids really so...
me and my brother pretty much were raised by my grandparents.
well, what 's your brother like? -He 's...
he 's different.
I don 't know. My mother 's death kind of affected him differently.
probably more, really.
how so?
he turned out...
just a little off somewhere, I don 't know.
problematic kid, really. He 's...
I 'll put it this way: when they asked me to run for sheriff...
they said they 'd badge me only under one condition:
that I'd run my brother out of the parish. So...
who 's they? -The people who sign my checks.
so I ran him out of the parish.
but that 's not helping us connect the governor to Mona, is it?
I'm going to try to do something. -You can 't drive home like that.
look, I 've got a couch, okay? It 's got "Darl" all over it.
flower
come to me
winter isalmost here
if you drink water before you go to bed, the room won 't spin.
Thanks.
are you sure you don 't want a pillow?
no, I 'm alright.
frankly, I 'm just glad to have a couch.
sweet dreams. -You too.
good night.
I just... -Darl...
I just...
it 's too soon.
I can 't. -No, I know. I was just...
I was thinking about not being able to sleep or something.
wake up!
Darl!
I thought you 'd gone.
I forgot my keys. -You left them inside.
go inside and warm up. I'll go fetch some coffee.
Hello? Hello? Anybody home?
Oh! Is Mona here?
I had an appointment at 9. Are you running over?
running over what? -I 'm going to come back later.
so you know, some old shit came by saying he had an appointment.
shoot! It 's one of Mona's monthly's.
whatever operation it is, it 's disgusting. Did you see my keys?
his name is Mr. Prestman, and he isn 't a freak!
he misses his wife, okay? They were married for 50 years.
she dies, so he misses her, so he likes to wear her dresses.
ls that so fucking horrible? -That 's perfectly normal.
your keys are on the mantel. Darl, what are you so afraid of?
I think the whole damn situation here is a little odd.
Really? You ran your own brother out of town. Is that normal?
you don't know my family! -Girls get fucked by their dads!
you're astripper that lives with a freak! Call that normal?
don't talk about someone I love! -I talk about who I want to!
you wanted to fuck me and didn't even know if I had a dick or not!
somebody who couldn't deal with their sexual impulses killed Mona.
shut up! -You shut up!
fucking freak!
get out of myfuckingway before lslapthe shit out ofyou!
shut up!
Mona, the D. O.A. was sent here as a lingerie model.
I 've got awitness that puts him at your gate at 2: 15...
and a phone record that puts him at a phone booth at Ornelle 's...
a mile that away. And...
there 's this little deal here.
I found this bloody shoe in your backyard.
that 's it? -No. There 's a matter of your dog.
buster was found at the body. -Nothing that would stick.
stand up.
ls that fun? -Oh, yeah. You 're a sweetie.
he 's clean.
you know what an "imbroglio" is? -No, I don 't.
that was one of my favorite words in college. It means...
complicated situation. -We had a party.
the kind that you don 't bring your wife to.
that freak could 've passed for Miss America.
maybe she was here, and maybe she wasn 't.
whatever, bottom line we did not kill her.
him.
Cletus can tell you. We were locked and cleared out by 2: 3O.
when that truck driver saw that woman on the highway...
we were home with our wives.
Burnson 's people are on my ass to go public.
if the press gets aworth of that...
our governor partying with a transsexual who ends up dead.
he 's going to drop like a rock. And your casino project too.
Burnson probably set the whole thing up himself.
the members of this club are honorable men, Darl.
you want that kind of enemies?
I always wondered what it was like in here. It smells like shit!
you threw aspit ball on my head. -Wait a minute, Darl.
I 'm getting this thing overturned and my job back, I promise you.
you think you know what you're doing, but you don't.
Really? Is that right?
if by tomorrow the appeal board doesn 't reconsider my case...
I 'm going to press. I 'll call Burnson quicker than shit.
sleep good.
what the hell do we do now?
something they didn't teach you at the Kennedy Business School.
Darl, wait up there!
hold on, son!
we thought about it...
and we generally accept your demands.
we'll work in good faith to get your job back.
but there 's a loose end.
that Scarlet person, does she know you know?
she gave a false address on the death certificate.
you know how we can contact her?
she 's in New Orleans. -We know that.
I 'll get you an address. I 'll give you a call.
the sooner, the better.
what 's wrong with you?
so when you lost your badge, that 's it, you lost everything.
you got that right. -So whatever it takes...
I mean, to get it back, that 's what I got to do, that 's about it?
I never missed a day of work, I had a perfect record.
even after you cleaned her off the floor?
what? Who?
that wasn 't my fault. -David always said you shot her.
that faggot is every bit as crazy as she was.
myself, I never believed you had the guts.
she pulled my chrome handled Smith & Wesson with a6-inch barrel...
and was waving it at me, screaming her hysterical shit!
she was crazy! She puts it right there to the side of her head.
that 's when I said these last words: "go ahead, bitch, do it!"
I made it into work the next day...
I pulled a full shift...
I had a perfect record.
here you go, sugar.
howdy, ma'am.
well, hello, cowboy.
I 'm looking for Scarlet. -She ain 't here.
she 's over that strip joint? -Maybe.
she said you 're the one trying to find the bastard who killed Mona.
any luck? -We're making a little progress.
girls like me got a free shot bull's eye on our backs.
if you solve this one, it 'd be a first.
and you are so fine that I might give you that purple heart myself.
I'd appreciate that. Have a good day.
Yeah, we're here now. I 'll call you later. All right.
she gave a false address on the death certificate.
you know how we can contact her?
what 's happening, man? -ls Scarlet around?
Yeah, she 's here. That 's US$ 1O.
scarlet is doing it foryou, working hard for appreciation.
show it by stepping up there and tipping that sexy lady.
Hi, baby.
can I get you something to drink, baby?
it 's a 2 drink minimum.
everybody in the house put those hands together, make some noise!
for Scarlet.
we 've got to get out of here. -I 'm not going anywhere with you.
the governor 's after you. -How do they know about me?
don 't worry about that.
you can 't be back here! -I 'm talking to her, all right?
I don 't care what you 're doing! -I said I 'm talking to her!
okay, I know him! Gitter, it 's me. I know him.
I don't give a fuck if he's your dad! We've got rules!
you can leave on astretcher or you can leave like a gentleman.
come on, man.
Hey, stop it!
fucker! I told your mother-fucking ass!
Darl! Darl! I'm going to call an ambulance.
Oh, my God, you think you... -Look who we found!
stop it! Get up!
stop it! -Come on!
let go, damn it! -Just get in the car! Come on!
get off!
No!
get in there!
let go of her! Let her go right now!
get your hand away from your pocket! Right now!
take the keys! Go to the truck! -Calm down, buddy! I 'm a cop!
I said get your hand away!
calm down, buddy! -Hand out of the pocket!
come on!
hurry up!
we 've got to get them!
pull over! -What? They 're going to kill me!
let me in! Let me in! The fucking door!
Hurry! Hurry up!
where are we going? -To the TV.
everybody needs help.
see if you can read that?
gizmo Hebert - Republican Party Headquarter.
shit! They 've find the truck.
where 's David? -What happened to you?
we almost got caught. Don 't worry, I 'll tell you later. David!
I know you knew Mona. The guys who killed her are after us.
I need to borrow your car. I really need your help out here.
please? -David, come on.
do you have the keys? -Yes.
what does it look like? -lt 's out front. It 's a Volvo.
lf anybody comes around asking... -I don 't know anything.
take these. You might need a disguise.
being kicked out of Le Salle was the best that happened to me.
I wonder what makes people turn out the way they turn out.
I don't know. Monasaid she always liked her Barbies from the gecko.
okay, so we tell them that you want to talk to the press.
don't be afraid to tell them everything you know about Mona...
tidewater and the whole shooting match.
when your story gets out, that 's your protection.
are you all right?
I can't believe I'm depending on republicans to save me.
where 's Gizmo?
Hey, Darl.
Darl misread our intentions. We weren 't going to hurt you.
we wanted to give you a paid trip to Cancun till after the election.
your little elves put a bullet through my truck.
that was a mistake. -A mistake?
Darl, what 's going on? -Hell if I know.
a truce. -More like a Mexican stand-off.
sister Felicia confessed. The anti-casino folks...
planned to pick up a transsexual from a New Orleans club.
sister Feliciawas in all this? -Partially. She would tip Gizmo...
when the governor showed up at Tidewater.
gizmo picked Mona up from the bar and invited to work a party.
drove her out with a premeditated purpose of taking a few photos...
of a transgender person socializing with the governor.
you killed Mona?
no. I 'll pass a polygraph.
but you drove her to Tidewater. -Okay.
but when our telephoto lens came out, freaks got offended...
we had an M. O. Thought it was for money. She was hysterical.
it got iffy, so we kicked her out of the car and George Jetson.
you just left her? -Yeah, bubba. We just left her.
then who killed Mona? -I can tell you with certainty...
that nobody in this room committed a capital crime.
both parties committed failures of judgment only.
now we should negotiate a binding and good faith settlement...
to keep this story in this room.
let the campaign decide the issues. It's what the people want.
if you can't tell me who killed Mona, you have nothing for me.
there it is. A fly in the ketchup.
somebody like Mona or Scarlet here might have a conscience.
this place stinks worse than Tidewater. Let 's get out of here.
you're the last person to be lecturing anybody on ethics.
you 're right, judge. You 're always right.
Darl!
Darl, hold up. You're a parole violator who 's fired on police.
don 't be stupid. -That 's what I do best.
I won 't go to the press. I don 't give ashit who wins the election.
but I guarantee you one thing: I'll find out who killed Mona.
if anybody tries to stop me, I'll go kicking and screaming.
are you going to let him leave? -I'm out of my jurisdiction.
you 're out of your job.
Darl! There's a woman out here.
it's about real justice for Mona.
this is Darl Hardwick. Who am lspeaking to?
it's me. You got the phone booth out front of my place.
she made a call from your phone booth at 3 am. Did you see her?
no, I didn 't.
Ornelle says he was asleep. He didn 't see anything.
something about this place really feels weird.
is that it?
0. 65 + 0, 40. US$ 1. 05. With tax, US$ 1. 60.
well, you got it down, don't you, Ornelle?
I still haven 't been paid. -Take that out of your judge.
you have a ladies room I could use?
ladies room is closed. It 's unclean.
well, do you have a man 's bathroom?
I don 't believe in that, ma'am. There 's a Dixie Burger up ahead.
she doesn 't want to go there, she wants to use the bathroom.
you 're not one of them? -One of who?
them who use the bathroom they ain 't supposed to use?
where 's the key, Ornelle? -Lost it.
who 's going to pay for this?
what is it, Darl?
who do I bill for that?
you can't go in there!
that's employees only!
Darl?
Oh, my God!
you sat there and watched that girl through that peep hole?
if this gun matches that bullet that killed her, it 's all over.
Why?
I want you to tell me.
fuck! Tell me you want me!
fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck you!
bitch, bitch...
get out you freak! Freak!
Oh, my God! -You tricked me, you bitch!
you tricked me, you whore!
stay away from me, you son of a bitch!
help me!
please!
you ain't telling nobody on me!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
bitch!
he never should have went in the ladies'.
that 's not right.
that's for ladies.
that 's all I'm going to say about it.
Oh, my God.
I got it.
Hello?
Hi. How are things?
fine.
that 's good.
look, you want mom? -Yeah. Tell her it 's important.
she might be needed here.
hold on. -Hey, wait.
what?
I just want to tell you I love you both.
hold on...
I 'll get mom. Mom!
in a Baton Rouge press conference, the governor stated...
that yesterday's loss is not the end of his politicalcareer.
and although I am conceding this race, I am not defeated.
not when there's work left to do for the people of Louisiana.
well, look how beautiful we are. Mona is smiling down on us.
I know that all of us have lost people.
and every time I think about her being face-down that swamp...
it breaks my heart. But we 're not going to talk about that today.
she was beautiful and she 'd like to be remembered beautiful.
and she'd be so happy that all of you are here. Thank you so much.
I was hoping you'd come.
I'm giving things away. I didn't want to go through it alone.
I'll confess: I knew who you were before going to your office.
david told me you were brothers, and that you were a real dick.
we both thought it best that l not tell you we knew each other.
cause you might hold it against us.
I probably would have.
I'm sorry for lying about it.
I think I'm going to thank somebody for a car.
it's about time.
are you going to be here?
Yeah, I'll be right here.
all right.
in the moment when I say the number 3...
...you will enter the state of deep relaxation
all the stresses and worries of the day...
...will fall away, and you will feel complete relaxed
as you fall towards the states of tremendous well being
deeper and deeper...
one...
deeper...
deeper...
three...
