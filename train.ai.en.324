mr olmert has no interest in concessions that reinforce the idea that he led his warrior nation to defeat.
mr olmert has reportedly been rejecting the army's most ambitious plans.
mr olmert is still on trial, before another court, for alleged bribery over a building project begun when he was mayor of jerusalem.
mr olmert might have recalled his own words: "a prime minister must ask himself where best to direct his own efforts. Are [ they] directed toward making peace or are they directed constantly towards making the country stronger and stronger in order to win a war?"
mr olmert reckons that at the end of the day, if presented with a realistic prospect of dislodging mr netanyahu and resuming the abandoned peace process, most moderate israelis would swallow hard, and give the peace ticket their backing.
mr olmert was speaking on a day when hizbullah fired a record number of rockets into israel, at a moment when no international force existed, and when the plans to create one remained a study in vagueness (see article). Who would put up the troops?
mr olmert will ask how he can be expected to do any business at all with a palestinian government whose dominant party denies israel's right to exist, remains wedded to armed struggle and says it wants israel's destruction.
mr olmert, announcing a unilateral ceasefire, followed 12 hours later by a matching one by hamas, said the palestinian group had been shocked by israel's readiness to attack its fighters in civilian areas.
mr olmert, echoed by george bush, says that israel won because it has transformed lebanon.
mr olmert, meanwhile, accused iran of instructing mr nasrallah to start a war to distract world attention from iran's apparent effort to flout the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and build a nuclear bomb.

mr olofsson has said he prefers to leave markets where carrefour is not one of the top two retailers or has little hope of becoming one.
mr olofsson has said little, hinting only that he wants to concentrate on markets where carrefour is either the market leader or a strong contender to become so.
mr olofsson is under pressure from bernard arnault, the boss of lvmh, a luxury-goods group, and colony capital, a property-investment firm.
mr olofsson's predecessor, jose-luis duran, also withdrew from markets where the company was weak, such as mexico and japan.
mr olsson said high job security at chinese state-owned mobile companies helped explain why it had proved such a tough services market, but forecast that more operators would follow china mobile hebei's lead in search of greater efficiency.

mr orban's fiery language against brussels and international finance can still rally the faithful.

mr osborne might have offended low-to-middle earners without truly electrifying the high-rollers.

mr osborne should rectify that.
