Lucy, do you want some? What--red, white?
red. We always have red.
white.
I've never liked red.
Lucy!
so you used to be an architect?
long time ago.
can it. She doesn't want to hear your life story.
Wow. So, did you build your own house?
is it your dream home?
you could call it that.
I'll build you a dream home once I get on my feet.
why is it you can see Ray and I can't?
I was in an accident. It was a car accident.
about five years ago.
they say that, something when you have a traumatic expericence, it can alter your perception.
so after that, you could just see spirits?
I mean, what happened?
how about you talk to Ray? That's why I'm here.
finally, I'm in the conversation. Terrific.
I do have an important question I have to ask Ray.
he can hear you.
I really need to know where you invested my money.
the ＄16, 000 that I had saved.
the attorneys can't find it.
Oh, shit! I blew it on a bad investment.
don't tell her that. Let me think.
it's gone. Lucy, it's gone.
blown on a bad investment.
you asshole!
tell her I'll look out for her. I'll move back into the house.
that's not a good idea.
this doesn't concern you.
what's Ray saying?
he left. Ray left.
he said he's sorry, but you should get on with your life.
Bannister, I'm going to kill you!
I can't believe it. That's just like Ray to just take the money and run.
ray and I haven't been honest with each other in a long time, Mr. Bannister.
it wasn't what you would call a good marriage.
you bitch!
it'll be okay.
hands off my wife!
God damn it!
sorry.
I can move shit, Bannister. You better watch your back.
I better clean this up.
be right back.
good food, huh?
Yeah...it's great.
mom!
looks like another heart attack. Can't confirm it till the autopsy.
damn.
a waiter saw a guy exit the john right before the body was found.
and who was that?
Frank Bannister, pale and shaking. The waiter thought he was sick.
damn.
Hi, Lucy.
Dr. Lynskey works for me. We're colleagues.
she's a material witness.
Bannister was last seen in the restaurant parking lot.
he tool off at high speed.
bring him in.
look at that!
so your dead husband was having dinner with you?
what did he order?
Oh, God. Excuse me.
Timmy, front desk, please.
thank you.
Lucy, this is Special Agent Milton Dammers of the FBI.
I came by train. I planned to fly, but I didn't feel good about the plane.
at what time precisely, did Bannister leave for the bathroom?
you.
I'm not sure precisely.
did he use excessive amounts of salt?
answer the question.
for Christ's sake, it's really late!
I don't remember!
what is this?
excuse me, Lucy. I'll be right back.
Milton...
sorry, Sheriff.
I have a problem with women yelling.
can I get you anything?
sheriff Perry!
you are violating my territorial bubble.
Lucy, you're still grieving.
it would be easy for a man like Frank to take advantage.
you have such closed minds.
I object!
special Agent Dammers has over 20 years' experience in the area of paranormal psychology.
much of that was spent undercover with various cults and sects.
I get all the fruity cases, Mrs. Lynskey.
for God's sake, Milton, come in and sit down.
I'm more comfortable standing.
what has this to do with Frank?
Mrs. Lynskey, you know nothing about Frank Bannister.
you claim he's a bona fide psychic yet all I have heard is ill-informed, meandering waffle.
on the third day of July 1990...
Frank Bannister, then a successful architect, was overseeing construciton of his new home.
the contractor would later confirm that Bannister was consuming alcohol that morning.
12: 23 P. M.
Platz sees Bannister arguing with his wife, Debra.
it appears he had promised Debra a garden and then, without consulting her, laid a 4-inch thick concrete slab creating a basketball court for himself.
12: 31 P. M.
Platz watches the couple drive away.
Bannister kept a tool box in the back of his car.
in it was a utility knife with a retractable blade.
Bannister purchased seven new blades that morning at Jesson's Hardware Store and Building Supply on Third and Garrett-- Third and Garrett.
third of July.
seven blades. Three.
Milton, you're mumbling; we can't understand a word you're saying.
12: 33 P. M.
Their'84 Volvo heads into the hills.
it is the last time anyone will see the couple together.
by Bannister's admission, the argument continues, reaching a point when Debra demands to be let out.
at that moment, probably 12: 36, 12: 37 P. M. the car leaves the road on a curve, presumably because Bannister was driving too fast.
she was killed?
her body was found 15 yards from the car.
was picked up 2 hours later, wandering in the woods.
he claimed to have no recollection of the events that occurred after the accident.
but here's the odd thing, Mrs. Lynskey.
his utility knife was missing.
and to this day, it has not been found.
but do you know what was really bizarre?
Debra's corpse had the number 13 carved into its forehead.
unlucky for some.
you're insane. You're talking about a mythical figure.
a pseudo-religious icon from the 12th century.
save your pea-brained prattle for the classroom, boy.
that was the Soul Collector.
he's been taking people out since time began.
he's going about some dark business here in Fairwater and we ain't nothing but worm bait!
when your number's up, that's it!
there's another one gone.
he's gone.
there's no money for you here, Mr. Bannister.
you're next.
are you threatening me?
that's not what I'm saying.
he's threatening to kill me.
will you relax? -He is threatening to kill me!
Oh, great.
Hey, fellas.
excuse me, excuse me.
put the gun away.
Freeze! -Just take it easy.
okay, Bannister, you're under arrest.
just stay there, Bannister.
Yes.
great.
I did it.
Uh-uh-uh, Bannister. Stop.
looks like I ain't shooting with blanks no more!
mighty fine woman. Good teeth.
judge.
down!
they don't call me the hanging judge for nothing.
stay right there.
heads up!
good catch.
Freeze!
good shooting, Tex.
and she was so young and beautiful!
I like it when they lie still like that.
this is heavy.
Hey, guys! My juices are flowing again!
judge!
judge!
Frank, get out of here, now!
bastard!
got to go.
stop!
Damn! Come on!
just get down!
get down and stay down.
magda!
listen to me.
No!
Where'd he go?
you killed me, you bastard! You're sick!
is this how you get your kicks?
did it feel good killing me?
did it feel good killing your wife?
you're a murderer!
he won't get far. We have the state line covered.
sheriff Perry...
I seriously doubt we will see Bannister any time soon.
he is resourceful beyond anything you can comprehend.
Hello, Frank.
Hey, Walt.
I've come to report that Magda Rees-Jones's body is lying near my car off Holloway Road.
did you have anything to do with her death?
Frank, are you okay?
what happened?
what are you doing?
you're arresting him?
please leave.
Frank, you need a lawyer.
go home, Lucy.
but you haven't done anything. He hasn't done anything!
how do you know?
do you know me?
am I a nice guy? Because that cozy scene in the restaurant was bullshit.
because I was doing my job.
I don't give a damn about you or anyone.
what are you saying?
go home.
are you okay to drive?
there has been a destructive force unleashed on this town such as I have never seen.
we have a body count of 28.
you're a very dangerous man.
you're not seriously suggesting that Frank is responsible for...
you're way out of your depth here, Sheriff. Please leave.
Frank Bannister is my prisoner.
by the power invested in me by the President of the United States...
I am telling you to get the hell out of this room.
have you ever heard of Nina Kulagina?
march 10, 1970, Nina Kulagina, with the power of her mind stopped the beat of a frog's heart.
the record of this experiment is currently held in the files of Professor Gennady Sergeyev of Saint Petersburg.
as Sergeyev interpreted the cardiogram the heart experienced a flare-up of electrical activity.
the heart imploded all because Nina Kulagina wanted the animal dead.
I don't kill people.
part of you believes that.
there's another part of you, Frank,that's out of control.
your destructive impulse.
I've seen a figure in a cape.
I've seen him reach into people's chests and squeeze their hearts.
who was it?
who was it?
death.
I can communicate with the other side.
I can see spirits.
I don't know why.
I can't understand it.
you think you're quite unique, don't you?
but in my business, I deal with your type every other week.
this death figure is nothing more than a homicidal alter ego that satisfies your compulsion to kill.
every time you want to kill someone "death" does it for you.
it's your way of absolving yourself of guilt.
No!
when did you first start seeing spirits? After Debra's death?
you killed your wife.
No!
I have studied the coroner's reports of every death here since 1985.
twenty-eight cases involved crushed hearts,arteries choked until they burst.
that started in 1990, with your beautiful wife, Debra.
she was the first.
you argue with him, 3 hours later he's dead.
we know you didn't like Magda Rees-Jones.
but what about the guy in the toilet?
what did he do to you, Frank?
piss on your HushPuppies?
why are you shaking?
Oh, my.
my, my. You're doing it right now, aren't you?
you're trying to kill me, right now.
well, forget it, Bannister.
I'm wearing a lead breastplate!
we have 28 unexplained deaths here.
you know what I think? I think you are involved in each and every one of them!
well, so much for the dream home.
what are we doing here, Lucy?
look at this place. It's a dump!
God, this guy is a loser.
perfectly good basketball court gone to pot.
Yeah, Bannister.
Mr. Bannister, help me!
my daughter, Patricia, is communing with the Evil One.
he's in this house at her instigation.
help me drive them out!
Lucy, why do you keep shutting me out?
Lucy!
Patricia?
Dr. Lynskey.
Patricia, are you all right?
it's your mother.
she's been hurting you.
she needs help. She's delusional.
you can't go on like this.
you don't understand.
No!
my father killed himself after the murders.
mother says it was my fault.
so I have to keep his ashes in my room.
Oh, my God.
she says I'm evil.
just like Johnny.
come with me to Mother's room.
this isn't you.
this isn't who you are now.
it was Johnny.
he went crazy.
I couldn't get away from him. I thought he'd kill me.
you have to get out of this house.
you can start over.
it's Mother. Please hide.
please.
I'll take her to the kitchen. You sneak out later.
what are you doing in here?
I thought I heared a noise.
I'll make you some coffee, Mother.
mother.
the coffee's ready.
Lucy, go.
thank you, Deputy.
just call me when you're done, Dr. Lynskey.
Frank, listen to me.
I found your knife, hidden in old lady Bradley's closet.
she's crazy, Frank.
you haven't hurt anybody.
you're a good person, Frank.
don't do this.
please, don't do this.
do you think you're the only person who ever lost somebody?
you walk around like you have no feelings but the truth is you're just scared!
goddamn hypocrite.
why are you doing this? What are you afraid of?
I don't want to hurt you, Lucy.
Oh, that's crap. Don't give me that.
look at me.
I'll be outside. This shit is like walking in on your parents.
Oh, right. I'll be outside. I'll just...
what is it, Frank?
look out!
you son of a bitch!
what's happening?
grab him! Grab him!
what's happening?
okay. Listen to me.
call for the deputy. And try to sound calm.
deputy!
I'm ready to leave.
where did he go?
Stuart, where did he go?
I think we got him.
you son of a bitch!
get out, Frank! Go!
it's this way. Go.
freeze, Bannister.
help. -I got you now.
help me. He's gone crazy.
okay. Ah! Stay back!
now...
Frank, come on!
go, Frank! Get out of here! Now!
Frank, let's go!
this way. Come on.
shit!
what was in that cell? Something was crushing my heart.
I can't fight him, Luce. I can't protect you.
there's one way to deal with this thing.
I have to have an out-of-body experience, and I have to have it now.
go away, Luce. Walk the other way.
wait. Wait.
this will slow your heart and lower your temperature.
you'll have 20 minutes. Any longer and there's a danger of tissue damage.
that's only if I successfully revive you. There's no guarantee.
Frank, you don't have to do this.
better close the door. Hurry up.
it won't take long.
I didn't know you had an interest in cryogenics.
I'm reviving at 9: 00.
why would we want to do that?
Luce!
Lucy?
there we go.
let me go, you bastard!
let me out now!
you bastard, let me out of this car now!
I find cemeteries very restful places, don't you?
turn this car around and take me back.
I intend to, Mrs. Lynskey.
in exactly...eleven hour's time.
son of a bitch!
let me out of here! Come back here, you creep!
my body is a road map of pain.
but pain has its reward.
the power of the mind is absolute.
Frank, is that you?
I'm doing this?
I'm doing this?
I'm moving the car with the power of my mind!
Yes!
No!
wait!
get back in the goddamn ground!
you unorganized grab-asstic gob of teleplasmic shit!
who the hell are you?
sound off like you've got a pair!
Hey, asshole.
he's dead!
you're too late!
Lucy!
who are you?
who are you？
Johnny Bartlett.
I thought guys like you fried in hell.
I got out, Frank.
I've been carrying on the good work. Got me a score of 40.
Harry Sinclair.
I want to shake the hand of the man who avenged my death.
you have a number.
Bartlett carved it into my forehead as I lay dying.
I was the last.
he couldn't be more wrong, could he, Frank?
shit!
Oh, Frank.
just breathe. Breathe slowly. Breathe.
you're okay.
Oh, Frank.
all right, Lucy, come on.
get me 100 milligrams of lidocaine and 1cc of adrenaline.
I didn't get him.
who? Who didn't you get, Frank?
Johnny Bartlett. He's back.
he's hallucinating.
he's killing again.
Patricia.
you have to get her out of the house.
go.
go!
Patricia!
listen to me. We have to get out of here.
Patricia never leaves the house!
she's coming with me.
you have no right. Get upstairs.
this is stopping now.
what do you mean?
why do you have Frank Bannister's knife?
you've been in my room!
mother!
mother wants to go to the police.
she'll be down in a minute.
Patricia, we have to go now. It's not safe here.
Johnny Bartlett is back.
I know.
he visits me at night.
I don't know why he comes.
he torments me.
why has he come?
am I being punished?
Patricia, let's just go. Please.
I want to kill her, Patty.
that'll give us 41. That's 8 clear of Gacy.
nine more, we break Bundy's record.
I can't wait to see his face when he hears the news.
Yes! -What?
I'm sorry.
we really should wait for Mother.
that asswipe psychic nearly ruined it for us, Patty.
he made us look stupid.
you'll be okay. Everything will be fine.
shut up! That Russian cannibal creep is telling everyone he did 50 plus.
that reflects badly on both of us, Patty.
this record should be held by an American.
I quite agree.
you can come stay with me, if you like.
I'll kill her now.
I'd like that.
I'll just get my coat.
patronizing do-gooder bitch!
Oh, Patricia.
you kill her. I'll watch.
Mrs. Bradley?
Mrs. Bradley, are you coming with us?
Oh, my God.
Lucy!
no, not that way!
Jesus.
these are Bartlett's ashes.
we must get them to the other side.
a church. We have to get them to a church.
there's a chapel in the old hospital!
No!
let's go down here.
where is it?
you look there.
Lucy?
Oh, this is great.
Frank?
excuse me, Doctor. We're looking for ward 12.
go up the stairs to the 4th floor, then turn right.
it's opposite the chapel.
I'll get someone to help. Orderly!
orderly, are you deaf?
I said, orderly are you deaf?
moron!
I guess that makes you number one.
get down!
Frank, are you okay?
the chapel's on the fourth floor.
watch out!
we got to go. Go!
Lucy.
Lucy!
you're all the same.
wait!
put the gun down, son.
the law is on its way.
what's the score, Patty?
eleven
that's the same as Starkweather's.
Lucy?
it's jammed.
take it. Just take it!
be right back. Don't go anywhere.
give that to me.
let me guess.
you must get these ashes to consecrated groung to destroy the forces of evil.
give me the goddanm urn!
under no circumstances must these ashes ever be released.
Oops.
you have no idea what you've just done.
you just don't get it, do you, Frank?
this is all about your pathetic need for self-glorification.
you are such an asshole.
Yes, I am. I am an asshloe with an Uzi!
get up! You make me sick!
get up!
I won't shoot you in the back. Turn around.
I said, turn around!
as a U. S. government agent, I order you to turn around!
Oh, my God, Frank.
Debra.
you killed her.
you're next, pal.
take him out, baby.
get him!
stop!
Frank, no!
get him, Patty.
Oh, baby, you are an artist.
you're 42!
Yes.
I'm in the mood for a little vivisection.
No! No, please.
me, too.
you bitch!
I got your girlfriend, Johnny!
come get her!
goddamn you! Let go of her!
come and get her, you coward!
let go of my little Patty!
see you blater, Frank! We got you!
we're going back down to get us some more!
yo, Frank!
how's it going?
Bye, Frank.
step back, Frank. This won't be pleasant.
the old express bus to hell. No lines, no waiting.
it's really something, isn't it?
excellent libraries.
premium cigars.
and, of course the honeys.
how about that? Stu's a regular chick magnet up here.
Hello, Frank.
it's time to go home.
I am home.
Ahhh, no.
the authorities have informed us that it's just not your time.
start living, dude.
be happy.
there's something I have to tell you.
sorry to interrupt.
it's all right, Walt.
Frank, what do you know about Ouija boards?
not a lot.
I found a stack of them at the Bradley house.
looks like Patricia got herself a direct line to Bartlett once she was released 5 years ago.
I thought you and I could collaborate on a book about this.
it could be my ticket off the force.
that's not my area.
if you need a collaborator, how about your guardian angel there?
you got me, Frank.
I got you.
I'll see you, Frank. Bye-bye.
boy, that Dammers, he sure looks pissed.
sometimes when you go through a traumatic experience, it alters your perception.
get off me!
Oh, please.
please, don't hurt me.
it's wrong! She's too young!
the sins of the flesh will ruin her.
please don't hurt me!
please!
the wicked will be punished.
the mystery heart condition that has killed over 30 people in 4 years...has claimed another victim.
doctors are baffled as to why fit and healthy people are suffering massive heart attacks.
many residents claim that the "Shadow of Death" has again descended on the town.
"shadow of Death"? I don't like it.
that's what they're saying. People are scared out there.
for decades, Fairwater has been linked with death following the 1964 Bradley-Bartlett murder spree.
thirty years later, as the death toll steadily rises,it appears the Grim Reaper has once again returned to the quiet streets of Fairwater.
Oh, no. Steve, no.
I asked for a new angle. Give me something fresh.
I want to see the human face of this tragedy. Talk to the families.
how has this affected the local community?
Yes, Miss Rees-Jones.
and, Steve...no more references to death as a person.
friend of the family? Really such a shame.
go on. Get out. Go on.
get out!
damn.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
I don't believe this. This is not happening. My lawn!
you ruptured my lawn!
Hey, how you doing?
give me a call. I'll pay for the damages.
you're damn right! I'm suing your ass!
don't get litigious. Send me a bill.
"frank Bannister, Psychic Investigator"?
so why didn't you see the corner coming?
you stupid moron! This is goddamn bullshit!
this will cost you big time!
you're paying for a new fence!
I want this lawn completely resurfaced!
my Budzo! My Budzo!
I got your license plate number! You bastard!
this is private property.
Mrs. Bradley? I'm Dr. Lynskey. I work at the medical center.
you do not. I know who works there.
I started 3 months ago.
Dr. Kamins is my physician.
he's attending a funeral. I'm seeing his patients today.
she was cutting vegetables. The knife slipped.
she just needs a few stitches. I'll drive you to the clinic.
that's impossible.
it's a deep cut.
leave us antibiotics.
mother, please.
Patricia never leaves the house.
but it hurts.
to your room this instant!
wait. Just a minute.
who did that to you?
I think you'd better go now, Dr. Lynskey.
you don't know who my daughter is, do you?
Patricia's not to be trusted.
I beg your pardon?
I can have her locked up anytime I want.
they said she was an accessory after the fact.
I know the truth.
it was cold-blooded murder.
in the space of 27 blood-soaked minutes,12 innocent people were shot by hospital orderly John Charles Bartlett.
patients, medical staff, visitors,no one was spared in this rampage through Fairwater Sanatorium.
not even the hospital chapel provided sanctuary, as those in prayer were shot on their knees.
we're reporters. We have to get the news!
a seemingly senseless crime...
Bartlett's motive remains a my stery to this day.
he's got a demonic look on his face.
any comments, Johnny?
got me a score of 12, sir. That's one more than Starkweather.
six years earlier, Charles Starkweather had murdered eleven people in a Nebraska killing spree.
guess that makes me public enemy number one!
fifteen-year-old Patricia Anne Bradley,daughter of the hospital administrator,was also implicated in the killings.
she was madly in love with the psychopath Bartlett.
that's her!
I was in her house this afternoon.
terrific. We're in town 3 months and you've befriened the Manson family.
2200 volts of electricity ended the life of Johnny Bartlett, the unrepentant killer.
as they threw the switch, he screamed:
I got me a score of twelve. Beat that.
in what some considered a miscarriage of justice...
Patricia Bradley was sentenced to life imprisonment,although it was never proven she participated in the killings.
five years ago, Patricia Bradley was ganted a conditional release by the governor.
today she lives a reclusive life back in the family home
should have fried her along with Bartlett.
she was fifteen years old. She fell in love with the wrong guy.
could happen to anyone.
sweetie, don't go back there. Please gives me the creeps.
I don't think...
come on, honey.
I think tiger's getting a little lonely.
what the hell is this doing here?
I thought I tore this up.
did he come back here? -Who?
the moron who tore up my fence!
help!
help! -He's alive.
ray, get me off!
you... sick... thing!
Lucy, I don't want that con man in my house!
there has to be some kind of rational explanation for this.
ray! We have got a poltergeist!
it's nothing the police can't handle.
Dr. Lynskey, I'm on my way.
persistent residue of the departed. Always a problem this time of year.
thank you. Thank you for coming.
the activity is located where?
I don't know. It went quiet about 5 minutes ago.
went quiet?
the dining room table spun in a counterclockwise direction?
I don't think that happened.
the toilet seat lid banged up and down?
did the bed levitate? -Yeah. With me on it.
spontaneous recurrent psychokinesis. Oh, boy.
this could be the worst case I've ever seen. It's bad.
well, I can do a clearance, but it's not going to be cheap.
I do offer a six-month guarantee.
how much?
and there is a 30% surcharge for making a house call after midnight.
and there's vehicle, gas.
I'd say the whole thing will set you back about ＄450.
we could forget about the fence, call it even.
stand back, ma'am. I don't want you to have to sign a waiver.
Plus, a hundred bucks for materials.
just do it, for Christ's sake.
here we go.
why us? Why are they in our house?
emanations are normally confined to the cemetery although they do escape.
usually young ones.
Oh, for God's sake, come on.
come on.
it's holy water.
this is bullshit. This is total bullshit.
come on, come on, come on.
Yes!
okay, these belong to you.
six ectoplasmic emnations.
don't worry. They can't escape.
some people like a souvenir.
I really don't think we want to keep those. Thank you. Do we, hon?
I could give a rat's ass.
okay, we'll just...
they can't feel a thing. At least that's what the book says.
you never know for sure.
all right. Thank you, Bannister. You can go.
what are you staring at?
what's with the number?
what number?
if you're trying to freak me out, it's not working.
he's just trying to get more money out of us.
get your shit and get the hell out of my house.
come on.
move!
thank you so much.
there you go.
Thanks. -Thank you.
why must you always alienate everybody?
I think I'm going to throw up.
damn.
I hate that trunk!
I don't want ectoplasmic muck all over my car seats.
the ectoplasm is the only thing sticky enough to hold the damn car together.
I'm sorry about your shit Volvo, but we won't ride in the trunk no more.
we could like to cruise with some style, man.
you two left me high and dry.
I get to the house, nothing's happening. I couldn't believe it.
Hey, Stuart--in or out.
not even a banging toilet lid. I looked like a asshole.
we strained our backs lifting that heavy-ass bed.
Oh, yeah. What idiot put the number on the guy's forehead?
it wasn't funny.
start pulling your weight, or it's back to the ecmetery.
pull this, Frank. I'm about to go like Jesse on your ass.
I'm going to find some other black ghosts and organize a march.
the African-American Apparition Coalition. The AAAC.
I'll tell you something.
nothing's worse than some pissed-off brothers that's already dead!
therefore, a happy ghost is a productive ghost.
to that end, I've drawn up a list of suggesttions.
bear in mind, we have given you five years of loyal service.
flies. That's what you've given me, flies.
why do flies stick to you guys like shit to a blanket?
very funny. You're a funny guy.
you only think about yourself. I could complain, too.
I need some new clothes. I still look like Linc from "The Mod Squad."
you died in the '70s. Bummer.
now, Frank, we got to talk about cigars.
you promised to buy me a box.
I hate to tell you, but you're dead. You can't smoke.
light one and blow the smoke in my face.
if I light a cigar, I'll blow my lunch in your face.
everybody, get down! Damn it, Judge!
put the shooters away!
that was a head shot! He could have killed me!
if I wanted to get shot at every day, I'd move to Los Angeles!
when a man's jawbone drops off,it's time to reassess the situation.
I got myself a nice little grave up there at the cemetery.
it could soon be time to lay my bones.
you're my go-to guy. Without you, I'm out of business.
Frightening...that's a young man's game, Frank.
I ain't got no more hauntings left in me.
what? You're in great shape.
my joints are getting powdery.
the dog is running away with my face. Hell, I'm falling apart.
you have been for years.
don't say nothing to the boys, but my ectoplasm is all dried up.
I'm sorry to hear that, Judge.
give it up, Frank.
death ain't no way to make a living.
I have to finish this house.
you'll never finish this house! You'll never finish nothing!
you're fooling yourself, Frank!
too many skeletons in the closet.
okay, this is it. We got to be hard.
we go in like Charles Bronson. We don't stop till the screaming starts.
I'm with you.
let's go.
Yeah. let's kich some ass.
here we go. One, two, three.
good morning, my darlings. Hello.
the mail is on the table, Mrs. Waterhouse.
Sylvia, Mother is coming for lunch. Pick up. Quick.
big kiss.
quit jumping around like a baby. This is serious.
we're going to scare the living daylights out of your parents.
will you help us out? -Are you with us?
see? He gets it. The kids always get it.
let's go.
Mrs. Waterhouse.
Mrs. Waterhouse!
damn. Here, man. This one did le poo-poo.
get it away from me. -Oh, man, it smells.
Mrs. Waterhouse!
my babies!
I'm on my way.
persistent residue of the departed. Always a problem this time of year.
Frank Bannister. I believe you called. Not a minute too soon.
Frank, she-- -Shut up.
Frank, it's no use.
this is bad.
recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis.
this could be the worst case I have ever seen.
I apologize for calling you, Mr. Bannister. Please leave.
what are you doing to me?
preying on the bereaved is as low as you can go.
you're a parasite. People should be warned.
I've a right to offer my services to the public.
in case you haven't noticed, we are having a major health crisis.
the last thing the people here need is a two-bit charlatan passing on bogus messages from the other side.
now, if you will excuse me.
I'm just trying to make a living.
living? Not a word you'd know a lot about, is it, Mr. Bannister?
Hey, easy.
you all right, buddy?
that was quite a fall.
you have to help. They're going to bury me.
you have to help. What is happening to me?
you appear to be dead, Ray.
that's impossible. I'm in the prime of my life.
I work out. My wife's a doctor!
why didn't you take the corridor? -What corridor?
the passageway to the other side.
because I don't belong there! Jesus Christ, I'm only 29!
just relax, all right? Tell me what happened.
I was on the rowing machine.
suddenly, I felt this vice-like grip squeezing my heart and I couldn't breathe, Frank, I just couldn't breathe.
I have the shakes. I need some vitamin B.
you can't take vitamins anymore.
you don't eat, drink or go to the bathroom. All that's over with.
in a year, you'll get another chance for the other side, to be a pure spirit.
in the meantime, you're an earthbound emanation, a rotting cloud of bioplasmic particles, dripping ectoplasm.
relax, Ray.
all right, Bannister.
can you give me a ride so I don't miss my funeral?
don't worry. They won't hurt you.
what in the hell is going on out here? Get back in your graves!
son of a...
holy Jesus. Frank Bannister!
go ahead. I'll handle this.
what are you doing in my graveyard? You have been tole to stay away!
sound off like you have a pair!
it's a public place, Hiles.
I do not like you!
do not bring your spooks in here without permission. Disappear, scumbag!
I am not one of your shitty little emanations!
you cannot push spirits around! You are scum!
using spooks to put the frighteners on people! That makes me physically ill!
we have a lot of lowlifes around here!
I will provide an armed response at any sign of trouble!
they must be contained!
catch you later, Hiles.
my tour of duty runs another 85 years!
there's a piece of dirt here with your name on it.
I'm waiting for you, you little maggot!
there were times when people accused Ray of being less than generous, but I am sure that deep down the man possessed a heart of gold and a generous spirit.
it's true. He wouldn't lie, not at a time like this.
because God has chosen to call Ray from this life to Himself, we commit his body to the ground.
earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Jesus, what a waste.
it's a goddamn tragedy!
good-bye, Ray.
Oh, sweetheart, don't cry.
Oh, shit!
Hey, Frank!
I know you can hear me!
get me out of this hole!
Frank! Get me out!
Hiya, Frank.
Hi, Walt.
I'm surprised to see you. Here on business?
not exactly.
they're going to bury me alive!
I hear you and Lynskey had a little run-in the night before he died.
apart from his wife, you were the last person to see him alive.
you're the one here on business.
no. The FBI is very concerned about these deathes.
they look like heart attacks, but when they slice these people open, their arterise are clean as a whistle.
but there's been tremendous pressure on the heart like the life's been crushed out of it.
you got any theories?
you mind if I pay my last respects before they fill him in?
Yeah. I'm sorry.
please.
Mr. Bannister.
did you want to see me?
my God, Frank, she can see me!
I thought perhaps you might have a message from Ray.
tell her. Tell her I'm here, Frank. Tell her.
everyone says you're a fraud, but I've seen what you can do.
Frank!
you must think I'm very stupid. Excuse me.
Lucy.
ray says he loves you very much.
here is your table.
is Ray with us?
tell her she looks great.
he, uh, he says you look great.
tell her they're from me.
those are from Ray.
it's our anniversary.
he says it's your anniversary.
is--is Ray beside me?
greetings.
how are you this evening? May I offer you some wine?
Lucy, do you want some? What--red, white?
red. We always have red.
white.
I've never liked red.
Lucy!
so you used to be an architect?
long time ago.
can it. She doesn't want to hear your life story.
Wow. So, did you build your own house?
is it your dream home?
you could call it that.
I'll build you a dream home once I get on my feet.
why is it you can see Ray and I can't?
I was in an accident. It was a car accident.
about five years ago.
they say that, something when you have a traumatic expericence, it can alter your perception.
so after that, you could just see spirits?
I mean, what happened?
how about you talk to Ray? That's why I'm here.
finally, I'm in the conversation. Terrific.
I do have an important question I have to ask Ray.
he can hear you.
I really need to know where you invested my money.
the ＄16, 000 that I had saved.
the attorneys can't find it.
Oh, shit! I blew it on a bad investment.
don't tell her that. Let me think.
it's gone. Lucy, it's gone.
blown on a bad investment.
you asshole!
tell her I'll look out for her. I'll move back into the house.
that's not a good idea.
this doesn't concern you.
what's Ray saying?
he left. Ray left.
he said he's sorry, but you should get on with your life.
Bannister, I'm going to kill you!
I can't believe it. That's just like Ray to just take the money and run.
ray and I haven't been honest with each other in a long time, Mr. Bannister.
it wasn't what you would call a good marriage.
you bitch!
it'll be okay.
hands off my wife!
God damn it!
sorry.
I can move shit, Bannister. You better watch your back.
I better clean this up.
be right back.
good food, huh?
Yeah...it's great.
mom!
looks like another heart attack. Can't confirm it till the autopsy.
damn.
a waiter saw a guy exit the john right before the body was found.
and who was that?
Frank Bannister, pale and shaking. The waiter thought he was sick.
damn.
Hi, Lucy.
Dr. Lynskey works for me. We're colleagues.
she's a material witness.
Bannister was last seen in the restaurant parking lot.
he tool off at high speed.
bring him in.
look at that!
so your dead husband was having dinner with you?
what did he order?
Oh, God. Excuse me.
Timmy, front desk, please.
thank you.
Lucy, this is Special Agent Milton Dammers of the FBI.
I came by train. I planned to fly, but I didn't feel good about the plane.
at what time precisely, did Bannister leave for the bathroom?
you.
I'm not sure precisely.
did he use excessive amounts of salt?
answer the question.
for Christ's sake, it's really late!
I don't remember!
what is this?
excuse me, Lucy. I'll be right back.
Milton...
sorry, Sheriff.
I have a problem with women yelling.
can I get you anything?
sheriff Perry!
you are violating my territorial bubble.
Lucy, you're still grieving.
it would be easy for a man like Frank to take advantage.
you have such closed minds.
I object!
special Agent Dammers has over 20 years' experience in the area of paranormal psychology.
much of that was spent undercover with various cults and sects.
I get all the fruity cases, Mrs. Lynskey.
for God's sake, Milton, come in and sit down.
I'm more comfortable standing.
what has this to do with Frank?
Mrs. Lynskey, you know nothing about Frank Bannister.
you claim he's a bona fide psychic yet all I have heard is ill-informed, meandering waffle.
on the third day of July 1990...
Frank Bannister, then a successful architect, was overseeing construciton of his new home.
the contractor would later confirm that Bannister was consuming alcohol that morning.
12: 23 P. M.
Platz sees Bannister arguing with his wife, Debra.
it appears he had promised Debra a garden and then, without consulting her, laid a 4-inch thick concrete slab creating a basketball court for himself.
12: 31 P. M.
Platz watches the couple drive away.
Bannister kept a tool box in the back of his car.
in it was a utility knife with a retractable blade.
Bannister purchased seven new blades that morning at Jesson's Hardware Store and Building Supply on Third and Garrett-- Third and Garrett.
third of July.
seven blades. Three.
Milton, you're mumbling; we can't understand a word you're saying.
12: 33 P. M.
Their'84 Volvo heads into the hills.
it is the last time anyone will see the couple together.
by Bannister's admission, the argument continues, reaching a point when Debra demands to be let out.
at that moment, probably 12: 36, 12: 37 P. M. the car leaves the road on a curve, presumably because Bannister was driving too fast.
she was killed?
her body was found 15 yards from the car.
was picked up 2 hours later, wandering in the woods.
he claimed to have no recollection of the events that occurred after the accident.
but here's the odd thing, Mrs. Lynskey.
his utility knife was missing.
and to this day, it has not been found.
but do you know what was really bizarre?
Debra's corpse had the number 13 carved into its forehead.
unlucky for some.
you're insane. You're talking about a mythical figure.
a pseudo-religious icon from the 12th century.
save your pea-brained prattle for the classroom, boy.
that was the Soul Collector.
he's been taking people out since time began.
he's going about some dark business here in Fairwater and we ain't nothing but worm bait!
when your number's up, that's it!
there's another one gone.
he's gone.
there's no money for you here, Mr. Bannister.
you're next.
are you threatening me?
that's not what I'm saying.
he's threatening to kill me.
will you relax? -He is threatening to kill me!
Oh, great.
Hey, fellas.
excuse me, excuse me.
put the gun away.
Freeze! -Just take it easy.
okay, Bannister, you're under arrest.
just stay there, Bannister.
Yes.
great.
I did it.
Uh-uh-uh, Bannister. Stop.
looks like I ain't shooting with blanks no more!
mighty fine woman. Good teeth.
judge.
down!
they don't call me the hanging judge for nothing.
stay right there.
heads up!
good catch.
Freeze!
good shooting, Tex.
and she was so young and beautiful!
I like it when they lie still like that.
this is heavy.
Hey, guys! My juices are flowing again!
judge!
judge!
Frank, get out of here, now!
bastard!
got to go.
stop!
Damn! Come on!
just get down!
get down and stay down.
magda!
listen to me.
No!
Where'd he go?
you killed me, you bastard! You're sick!
is this how you get your kicks?
did it feel good killing me?
did it feel good killing your wife?
you're a murderer!
he won't get far. We have the state line covered.
sheriff Perry...
I seriously doubt we will see Bannister any time soon.
he is resourceful beyond anything you can comprehend.
Hello, Frank.
Hey, Walt.
I've come to report that Magda Rees-Jones's body is lying near my car off Holloway Road.
did you have anything to do with her death?
Frank, are you okay?
what happened?
what are you doing?
you're arresting him?
please leave.
Frank, you need a lawyer.
go home, Lucy.
but you haven't done anything. He hasn't done anything!
how do you know?
do you know me?
am I a nice guy? Because that cozy scene in the restaurant was bullshit.
because I was doing my job.
I don't give a damn about you or anyone.
what are you saying?
go home.
are you okay to drive?
there has been a destructive force unleashed on this town such as I have never seen.
we have a body count of 28.
you're a very dangerous man.
you're not seriously suggesting that Frank is responsible for...
you're way out of your depth here, Sheriff. Please leave.
Frank Bannister is my prisoner.
by the power invested in me by the President of the United States...
I am telling you to get the hell out of this room.
have you ever heard of Nina Kulagina?
march 10, 1970, Nina Kulagina, with the power of her mind stopped the beat of a frog's heart.
the record of this experiment is currently held in the files of Professor Gennady Sergeyev of Saint Petersburg.
as Sergeyev interpreted the cardiogram the heart experienced a flare-up of electrical activity.
the heart imploded all because Nina Kulagina wanted the animal dead.
I don't kill people.
part of you believes that.
there's another part of you, Frank,that's out of control.
your destructive impulse.
I've seen a figure in a cape.
I've seen him reach into people's chests and squeeze their hearts.
who was it?
who was it?
death.
I can communicate with the other side.
I can see spirits.
I don't know why.
I can't understand it.
you think you're quite unique, don't you?
but in my business, I deal with your type every other week.
this death figure is nothing more than a homicidal alter ego that satisfies your compulsion to kill.
every time you want to kill someone "death" does it for you.
it's your way of absolving yourself of guilt.
No!
when did you first start seeing spirits? After Debra's death?
you killed your wife.
No!
I have studied the coroner's reports of every death here since 1985.
twenty-eight cases involved crushed hearts,arteries choked until they burst.
that started in 1990, with your beautiful wife, Debra.
she was the first.
you argue with him, 3 hours later he's dead.
we know you didn't like Magda Rees-Jones.
but what about the guy in the toilet?
what did he do to you, Frank?
piss on your HushPuppies?
why are you shaking?
Oh, my.
my, my. You're doing it right now, aren't you?
you're trying to kill me, right now.
well, forget it, Bannister.
I'm wearing a lead breastplate!
we have 28 unexplained deaths here.
you know what I think? I think you are involved in each and every one of them!
well, so much for the dream home.
what are we doing here, Lucy?
look at this place. It's a dump!
God, this guy is a loser.
perfectly good basketball court gone to pot.
Yeah, Bannister.
Mr. Bannister, help me!
my daughter, Patricia, is communing with the Evil One.
he's in this house at her instigation.
help me drive them out!
Lucy, why do you keep shutting me out?
Lucy!
Patricia?
Dr. Lynskey.
Patricia, are you all right?
it's your mother.
she's been hurting you.
she needs help. She's delusional.
you can't go on like this.
you don't understand.
No!
my father killed himself after the murders.
mother says it was my fault.
so I have to keep his ashes in my room.
Oh, my God.
she says I'm evil.
just like Johnny.
come with me to Mother's room.
this isn't you.
this isn't who you are now.
it was Johnny.
he went crazy.
I couldn't get away from him. I thought he'd kill me.
you have to get out of this house.
you can start over.
it's Mother. Please hide.
please.
I'll take her to the kitchen. You sneak out later.
what are you doing in here?
I thought I heared a noise.
I'll make you some coffee, Mother.
mother.
the coffee's ready.
Lucy, go.
thank you, Deputy.
just call me when you're done, Dr. Lynskey.
Frank, listen to me.
I found your knife, hidden in old lady Bradley's closet.
she's crazy, Frank.
you haven't hurt anybody.
you're a good person, Frank.
don't do this.
please, don't do this.
do you think you're the only person who ever lost somebody?
you walk around like you have no feelings but the truth is you're just scared!
goddamn hypocrite.
why are you doing this? What are you afraid of?
I don't want to hurt you, Lucy.
Oh, that's crap. Don't give me that.
look at me.
I'll be outside. This shit is like walking in on your parents.
Oh, right. I'll be outside. I'll just...
what is it, Frank?
look out!
you son of a bitch!
what's happening?
grab him! Grab him!
what's happening?
okay. Listen to me.
call for the deputy. And try to sound calm.
deputy!
I'm ready to leave.
where did he go?
Stuart, where did he go?
I think we got him.
you son of a bitch!
get out, Frank! Go!
it's this way. Go.
freeze, Bannister.
help. -I got you now.
help me. He's gone crazy.
okay. Ah! Stay back!
now...
Frank, come on!
go, Frank! Get out of here! Now!
Frank, let's go!
this way. Come on.
shit!
what was in that cell? Something was crushing my heart.
I can't fight him, Luce. I can't protect you.
there's one way to deal with this thing.
I have to have an out-of-body experience, and I have to have it now.
go away, Luce. Walk the other way.
wait. Wait.
this will slow your heart and lower your temperature.
you'll have 20 minutes. Any longer and there's a danger of tissue damage.
that's only if I successfully revive you. There's no guarantee.
Frank, you don't have to do this.
better close the door. Hurry up.
it won't take long.
I didn't know you had an interest in cryogenics.
I'm reviving at 9: 00.
why would we want to do that?
Luce!
Lucy?
there we go.
let me go, you bastard!
let me out now!
you bastard, let me out of this car now!
I find cemeteries very restful places, don't you?
turn this car around and take me back.
I intend to, Mrs. Lynskey.
in exactly...eleven hour's time.
son of a bitch!
let me out of here! Come back here, you creep!
my body is a road map of pain.
but pain has its reward.
the power of the mind is absolute.
Frank, is that you?
I'm doing this?
I'm doing this?
I'm moving the car with the power of my mind!
Yes!
No!
wait!
get back in the goddamn ground!
you unorganized grab-asstic gob of teleplasmic shit!
who the hell are you?
sound off like you've got a pair!
Hey, asshole.
he's dead!
you're too late!
Lucy!
who are you?
who are you？
Johnny Bartlett.
I thought guys like you fried in hell.
I got out, Frank.
I've been carrying on the good work. Got me a score of 40.
Harry Sinclair.
I want to shake the hand of the man who avenged my death.
you have a number.
Bartlett carved it into my forehead as I lay dying.
I was the last.
he couldn't be more wrong, could he, Frank?
shit!
Oh, Frank.
just breathe. Breathe slowly. Breathe.
you're okay.
Oh, Frank.
all right, Lucy, come on.
get me 100 milligrams of lidocaine and 1cc of adrenaline.
I didn't get him.
who? Who didn't you get, Frank?
Johnny Bartlett. He's back.
he's hallucinating.
he's killing again.
Patricia.
you have to get her out of the house.
go.
go!
Patricia!
listen to me. We have to get out of here.
Patricia never leaves the house!
she's coming with me.
you have no right. Get upstairs.
this is stopping now.
what do you mean?
why do you have Frank Bannister's knife?
you've been in my room!
mother!
mother wants to go to the police.
she'll be down in a minute.
Patricia, we have to go now. It's not safe here.
Johnny Bartlett is back.
I know.
he visits me at night.
I don't know why he comes.
he torments me.
why has he come?
am I being punished?
Patricia, let's just go. Please.
I want to kill her, Patty.
that'll give us 41. That's 8 clear of Gacy.
nine more, we break Bundy's record.
I can't wait to see his face when he hears the news.
Yes! -What?
I'm sorry.
we really should wait for Mother.
that asswipe psychic nearly ruined it for us, Patty.
he made us look stupid.
you'll be okay. Everything will be fine.
shut up! That Russian cannibal creep is telling everyone he did 50 plus.
that reflects badly on both of us, Patty.
this record should be held by an American.
I quite agree.
you can come stay with me, if you like.
I'll kill her now.
I'd like that.
I'll just get my coat.
patronizing do-gooder bitch!
Oh, Patricia.
you kill her. I'll watch.
Mrs. Bradley?
Mrs. Bradley, are you coming with us?
Oh, my God.
Lucy!
no, not that way!
Jesus.
these are Bartlett's ashes.
we must get them to the other side.
a church. We have to get them to a church.
there's a chapel in the old hospital!
No!
let's go down here.
where is it?
you look there.
Lucy?
Oh, this is great.
Frank?
excuse me, Doctor. We're looking for ward 12.
go up the stairs to the 4th floor, then turn right.
it's opposite the chapel.
I'll get someone to help. Orderly!
orderly, are you deaf?
I said, orderly are you deaf?
moron!
I guess that makes you number one.
get down!
Frank, are you okay?
the chapel's on the fourth floor.
watch out!
we got to go. Go!
Lucy.
Lucy!
you're all the same.
wait!
put the gun down, son.
the law is on its way.
what's the score, Patty?
eleven
that's the same as Starkweather's.
Lucy?
it's jammed.
take it. Just take it!
be right back. Don't go anywhere.
give that to me.
let me guess.
you must get these ashes to consecrated groung to destroy the forces of evil.
give me the goddanm urn!
under no circumstances must these ashes ever be released.
Oops.
you have no idea what you've just done.
you just don't get it, do you, Frank?
this is all about your pathetic need for self-glorification.
you are such an asshole.
Yes, I am. I am an asshloe with an Uzi!
get up! You make me sick!
get up!
I won't shoot you in the back. Turn around.
I said, turn around!
as a U. S. government agent, I order you to turn around!
Oh, my God, Frank.
Debra.
you killed her.
you're next, pal.
take him out, baby.
get him!
stop!
Frank, no!
get him, Patty.
Oh, baby, you are an artist.
you're 42!
Yes.
I'm in the mood for a little vivisection.
No! No, please.
me, too.
you bitch!
I got your girlfriend, Johnny!
come get her!
goddamn you! Let go of her!
come and get her, you coward!
let go of my little Patty!
see you blater, Frank! We got you!
we're going back down to get us some more!
yo, Frank!
how's it going?
Bye, Frank.
step back, Frank. This won't be pleasant.
the old express bus to hell. No lines, no waiting.
it's really something, isn't it?
excellent libraries.
premium cigars.
and, of course the honeys.
how about that? Stu's a regular chick magnet up here.
Hello, Frank.
it's time to go home.
I am home.
Ahhh, no.
the authorities have informed us that it's just not your time.
start living, dude.
be happy.
there's something I have to tell you.
sorry to interrupt.
it's all right, Walt.
Frank, what do you know about Ouija boards?
not a lot.
I found a stack of them at the Bradley house.
looks like Patricia got herself a direct line to Bartlett once she was released 5 years ago.
I thought you and I could collaborate on a book about this.
it could be my ticket off the force.
that's not my area.
if you need a collaborator, how about your guardian angel there?
you got me, Frank.
I got you.
I'll see you, Frank. Bye-bye.
boy, that Dammers, he sure looks pissed.
sometimes when you go through a traumatic experience, it alters your perception.
you want to wait outside?
no, sir. I'm fine.
you know, I drive by The Gates every day.
never actually been allowed inside, though.
I hear it's nice.
at the very least, you're gonna have to change the brochure.
Why's that?
I don't know if you can call it the "safest" place to live when the former chief of police is lying on my table with a bullet in his head.
let's not worry about the brochure right now.
okay, then.
cause of death...single gunshot wound to the back of the head.
9-mil. Point-blank range.
severed brain stem. Very clean.
so, what does that mean?
means the shooter knew what he was doin'.
chief's S. U.V. will be at Franklin labs in about an hour.
why don't you grab some coffee, then head over there and see what they turn up?
Mr. Buckley.
it's been a long night.
Yeah, it has.
he was a good man, Nick.
can't imagine how he ended up here.
I am sorry.
I'm gonna do everything I can to figure it out.
well, he was found outside The Gates. Doesn't that fall under county jurisdiction?
Yeah.
since he's one of ours, I suggested that we take lead in the investigation.
good.
that'll help us manage it.
what exactly are we managing, sir?
press. Perception.
peace of mind.
I developed The Gates as a place where people could get away from this sort of thing.
well, I'll do my best to "manage" it.
priority here is figuring out who murdered a cop.
of course it is.
you let me know if you need anything.
interesting.
what's that, honey?
well, you usually have one cup of coffee.
so, two would indicate a change in behavior.
or maybe I'm just thirsty.
or maybe dad told you about the case that kept him out all night.
and it's so major you can't stop thinking about it.
Dana, honey, daddy didn't tell me anything.
I knew it.
the thing with the hair...that's your tell.
you're not supposed to tell someone you know their tell.
but she needs to know I know she's holding out on me.
what are you holding out on?
nothing.
the case dad's working
I like that shirt. How come you don't wear it more often, huh?
because he never has a girl to impress.
that's what I mean about changing behavior, mom.
there's always a reason.
reason for what?
mom won't admit she knows about the case you're working on.
because mom doesn't know.
and you, my darling daughter, have broken the cardinal rule.
no cop talk at the table.
and what is the punishment for breaking the cardinal rule?
dishes for a week!
that is so not fair.
mom? - I will try and get your sentence reduced, but for now, go brush your teeth. You gotta go.
this is like her 99th strike! - Charlie.
we might need to up the punishment...
we... we need to go to school.
take the bagel.
I'll be there in a minute. Okay?
so, Dana's right.
this case is big?
you're not gonna believe this one.
the body they found?
former police chief of The Gates.
Yeah.
how?
bullet, back of the head. Sometime before we got here.
we'll be outside.
let's go! - Okay.
talk about this later? - Yeah.
keep smilin'.
Yeah.
love you. - Love you.
let's go! Come on!
Hey, uh, I gotta... run.
do you want a ride to school?
uh, no. No, I'm good.
you all right?
Yeah. Jean dilemma.
Oh. Well...
good luck with that.
it's kind of early for a bad day, isn't it?
Yeah, I think this one's gonna be rough no matter what the time.
well, I'm gonna make it a little better and buy you coffee.
thank you.
but you don't... you don't have to do that.
seriously.
I think it's like bad karma to deny a random act of kindness.
okay. Um... black.
two sugars.
but I'm... I'm buying you a muffin.
deal.
I'm Marcus... by the way.
nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
all right. Black. Two sugars. Let's go. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
sorry. Sorry.
I don't know what happened.
it's okay.
no, it's not okay. Emily's in the other room.
Emily's gone to school.
since you're working from home, I thought we could stay in bed a little longer.
do you do this on purpose?
do what?
I could have hurt you.
that's not quite what I had in mind.
you know, I'm beginning to think you prefer me like this.
in here I do.
Hey, Andie.
I... it's me.
look, I missed you in first period.
I really want to talk.
what's going on? Call me.
maybe she's with the new guy.
or... at least she was last night.
and you, my friend, were ready to take them out!
didn't know you had it in you.
what happened last night was a mistake.
you did me a solid, and now I owe you.
so let's just leave it at that, okay?
wait.
you're not still trying to get the girl back.
look, just stay out of it.
she's not the girl for you, Crezski!
let it go.
is it causing you any pain?
no, it's totally freaking me out.
well, it looks like some kind of rash.
but nothing to freak out about.
now, are you under an unusual amount of stress?
no.
well, sort of.
I mean, it's guy stuff.
like "more than one guy" kind of stuff.
do you think the thing on my back is 'cause of stress?
could be a contributing factor, yes.
so you might want to, um...
simplify things with the boys.
at least until we get this all figured out.
uh, yeah. Simplify.
got it.
Oh. One last thing.
have you told your father about this?
are you kidding? He freaks out when I get a headache.
okay. Well, I will check your blood work, and in the meantime, you... try not to worry.
Thanks, Peg.
aside from chief's prints,
CSI lifted six unidentified sets off the S. U.V.
all right, run them locally first, then national.
you got it. Wait, wait, wait.
what else can you tell me about this chief?
money problems, past relationships.
mm, no. Chief was pretty private about his personal life. - Yeah.
all right. What about the residents? Any recent run-ins?
no, not since I've been here.
how long's that? - Just over a year.
all right. Well, who's the most senior officer in this place?
that would be me.
Really?
chief didn't keep anyone around very long, so Marcus is coming up on the record.
well, who holds the record?
go find me Chad Taylor.
okay.
I understand you worked with the chief longer than anyone?
Yeah. Over a year.
but, uh, I haven't seen him in even longer.
I'm not sure how much help I can be.
you remember if he had any problems with the residents?
no. Not really.
you know, you were fired for insubordination.
What?!
he put that in my file?
that surprise you?
no, I guess "insubordination" is the new term for "knowing the chief's business.
okay, look, there were times... a bunch of them...
when I answered a call, I wrote up a report, and next thing I knew, chief made those reports disappear.
disappear. For money?
I never saw any change hands, but I suspect that you don't drive a $70, 000 S. U.V. on a chief's salary.
you remember any of the residents' names?
Yeah, like I said, there were a bunch.
uh... the McAllisters...
um, what was that woman's name?
I see you got my note.
do you really think it wise to threaten me?
dear, the threat to you is Mrs. Cooper.
she's the one who saw you pull that missing contractor's car out of your garage.
but I thought you gave her something to forget.
Yes, but it's just a temporary fix.
and it's wreaking havoc on that poor little mind of hers.
honestly, I'm not sure how long it will last.
what do you want?
to make that memory go away permanently,
I'll need a vial of your blood...
for the spell, of course.
for the spell.
do you honestly expect me to believe that?
I'm not asking for your trust, Claire.
I'm merely presenting a solution to your problem.
because without my help, Mrs. Cooper will remember.
and I can't imagine that ending well for you.
perhaps we should have a standing appointment.
well, that depends.
do you foresee the Radcliff name coming up in every case that I work?
Oh, is that what you're doing?
you're... you're working a case?
you know, maybe I should come back when your wife's here.
I'm sure I can answer whatever questions you might have.
okay.
we found a, uh, a body down by the river.
which river would that be?
you know, most people, when you tell them you found a body, they ask about the body.
who it was, how they died, were they murdered?
they don't really care what answer you give 'em.
what they really want to know is,"am I in danger?
my family in danger?
human nature.
you, on the other hand, Mr. Radcliff, you're concerned with geography.
well, most people don't live in gates.
those who do know there is no river here.
so clearly the body was found on the outside.
why, then, would I feel I'm in danger?
unless, of course, the police are not doing their job.
I'm doing my job.
maybe the former police chief was doing his job when somebody put a bullet in the back of his head.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was the chief.
how well did you know him?
well, we met once or twice.
I'm sorry. What does this have to do with my wife?
last October, she was pulled over for driving erratically.
and the officer who made the stop noticed...
copious amounts of blood on the right sleeve and front of her blouse.
you remember that incident?
no, I don't, but more importantly,
I don't understand what this has to do with the chief's death.
well, maybe nothing.
but the chief got rid of the file, and there was no further investigation into the case.
my wife... she gets nosebleeds.
so I can only assume the old chief did not deem that worthy of investigation.
well, that makes sense.
all right.
you know, my kid used to get nosebleeds.
a doctor fixed it in one visit.
well, I will be sure to let Claire know.
good.
I'll see myself out.
Hey. Where you been?
doctor's appointment.
okay.
are you under doctor's orders to ignore me or something?
uh, yeah. Pretty much.
I was only kidding.
well, I'm serious, Charlie.
my doctor says I need to reduce the stress in my life, and right now I have a boyfriend, which makes you kind of stressful.
all we did last night was talk.
how is that stressful?
I... I... I don't know.
I'm a girl.
I can be complicated without reason or explanation.
Charlie, Andie, you guys are going to be the co-counsel on people vs. Conlon.
good luck.
don't worry. I won't tell your doctor.
a... Andie, you got a minute?
I'm late for a riding lesson.
well, I'll walk with you.
I thought you hate horses.
no. Horses hate me.
look, I know I acted kind of crazy the other day.
no, it's... look, it's... it's okay.
I wasn't really myself, either.
it's... it's been a weird last couple of days.
look, I...
look, I don't know why I got so jealous, Andie.
I... I've never been like that with... with anyone.
and the thing I realize is,
I... I've never felt this way before...
the way I feel when I'm with you...
and it's like I don't even know what to do with it.
so what I'm trying to say is...I love you.
I... I wasn't expecting...
look, don't... don't feel like you have to say anything now.
see? I told you.
horses hate me.
look, I'll just, uh... I'll call you later.
okay?
get... get down.
good.
now work your way down to the neck.
and be sure to cut skin only.
any deeper, and the hair contaminates the meat.
okay.
all right. That's it.
stop.
very nice.
thank you, dad.
excuse me.
sorry to interrupt.
I'm Nick Monohan, the new chief of police.
you Lukas Ford?
what's this about?
incident last fall involving your boy.
give us a couple of minutes.
my son involved in vandalism?
and what officer did you say filed this supposed report?
officer Chad Taylor.
right.
he's the one that was fired, wasn't he?
Yeah.
well, I can't speak to your missing files, but I can assure you, if my son was into any kind of trouble, I'd know about it...
and he'd be dealt with accordingly.
well, maybe it was a mistake on Officer Taylor's part.
just so I'm clear, you never dealt with Chief Phelps directly?
never.
now, if that's all, I need to finish up, get this meat in the freezer.
sure. Thanks for your time.
you heard him. He's not gonna bother us anymore.
I am done covering for you.
so, five interviews, and no one will admit to any sort of corruption with the chief.
well, that doesn't surprise me, but I didn't come up empty-handed.
Dylan Radcliff didn't deny anything.
he just made an excuse for his wife.
Simon Ford, on the other hand, he denies having any contact with the chief, but in the same breath, he tries to discredit Chad Taylor.
so at the very least, we got two guys who are hiding something.
so what now?
now we go back to the source.
no, Mrs. Dennis is clean.
she made a lot of calls around 8: 00, but I believe that was her cocktail hour.
okay, next.
if you don't mind my asking, how exactly do you think this is gonna work?
well, you know most incident reports begin with a phone call, and the phone log was the one thing the old chief couldn't erase.
so, we checked to see what was called in, and if there's not a file to match, then bingo.
what do we got?
nothing so far. - Marcus.
I ran all six sets of those prints against the local and national database...
no match. - No match.
um, I don't mean to listen in, but did you try the resident database?
we don't fingerprint the residents.
well, we did when I was here.
is that something else that Phelps made go away?
Yeah.
let's run it. Nice work, Chad.
Emily thinks my stories are boring because they always end with a kiss.
and that's "icky.
something wrong?
chief Monohan...
he, uh, he stopped by today.
it's all right. It's not about the guy you killed.
then why was he here?
chief Phelps... he was murdered.
Oh, no. That's terrible.
was he stopping by to tell us?
no. He was more curious about an incident last October.
he said you were pulled over by a police officer, covered in blood.
Yes. I was coming back from your office, with blood that you gave me...
and I spilt it.
I told the officer it was a nosebleed, of course, and it never came up again.
well, yeah, it never came up again because Chief Phelps got rid of the file, Claire.
why would he do that?
because I paid him to.
it's Chief Monohan.
Hello?
how are you?
Really? No, she didn't mention it.
that would be lovely.
tomorrow it is, then.
Bye.
that was Sarah Monohan.
her daughter, Dana, has been assigned the role of Emily's older buddy at school.
they'd like to have ice cream tomorrow.
Claire, why would you pay off the chief of police?
because he gave me the option, and I took it.
because I knew that if word got back to you, you would think the worst, and you would never believe me.
just like you don't believe me now.
I have to get back to the laundry.
what's up?
so, is your dad harassing everybody about the chief's murder, or just my family?
look, I don't know what you're talking about, okay?
I got nothing to do with it.
see, here's the thing.
my dad didn't kill anybody.
but from what I know...yours did.
read all about it online.
but what I don't get, if it really was self-defense...
why did he lose his job?
Oh. I know.
it's 'cause he murdered the guy.
it's good. We're fine.
stay out of it!
officer Jordan speaking.
according to Cosmo, I should never call you first, but then again, I hate Cosmo.
Hi. How are... how are you?
I'm good.
except that it's been bugging me all day that my muffin cost more than your coffee.
well, it was a big muffin.
you gotta let that go.
well, or you can let me make it up to you tonight.
special treat.
uh, that sounds...
um, listen, I... I gotta get back to work.
maybe Cosmo was right?
no, no, no, no, no. Um...
definite yes on the treat, whatever it is.
just text me wherever. Okay? - Okay.
all right. Bye. - Bye.
chief! - What?
look who was in chief Phelps' car.
well, he hasn't logged out today.
he's on property someplace.
all right, stay put. I'm gonna check around back.
Mr. Ford?!
there's no call for that.
you lied to me about being in the chief's car.
you might want to reconsider your choice of words, officer.
you didn't ask me if I was in his car.
I asked you if you had direct contact with him.
you said no.
what word would you use for that?
extortion?
would you mind putting your gun away?
he demanded money.
I paid it.
that was the extent of our relationship.
you paid him for what?
I have a son who, in spite of my best intentions, seems to find trouble.
chief came to me, said for $10, 000, he would make my son's record go away.
so you were angry with the chief.
listen. - Easy.
I couldn't care less about $10, 000.
the only person I'm angry with is my son.
and that a personal matter.
I heard about what happened with Lukas.
I... I'm sorry.
that guy is such a jerk!
okay, so, um, a... are you ignoring me now, or...
isn't that what you wanted?
look, I... I know I haven't been that great to you.
it's just I...
I've been going through some complicated stuff lately.
you and me both.
maybe we should get out of here.
do something a little... less complicated.
how do you feel about horses?
they're getting along.
Yeah. Apparently, they're already Facebook friends.
Dana's clearly doing well.
what about you?
well, if you would have asked me yesterday,
I would have said everything is perfect.
but... I don't know.
today, with the former chief of police being killed...
I just didn't think it would happen in The Gates.
Dylan and I moved here from New York because we wanted to find the safest place for Emily.
and in spite of what's happened to the chief, I...I don't think that's changed.
this will blow over, and we'll go back to the sleepy little community where nothing ever happens.
actually, for me, that would be great.
I love this.
it's a mother/daughter ice cream outing.
so cute.
feel free to drop in by the spa anytime.
we can do mani/pedis, facials, and moms can have some time to themselves.
well, actually, we'd probably take you up on that.
you too, Claire.
should you ever find yourself in a jam,
I'm great with kids, and, um...
I know how important this little girl is to you.
have a nice day.
Bye. Bye. - Bye, Devon.
bite.
sir!
I checked the chief's financials like you asked.
and it looks like Simon Ford wasn't the only one that paid him off.
over the past six months, he's laid out quite a bit of cash.
$75, 000 for a condo in Cabo, $70, 000 on an S. U.V. and $20, 000 on a boat.
wait. When did he buy the S. U.V?
about three months ago.
run the prints from the S. U.V. against the employee database.
okay. - Do it now. Okay.
so, I ran some blood work on Andie.
and I've positively identified some of the cells as succubus paramour.
now, I think, with the right course of treatment, we could suppress that side of her, but treatment would need to begin immediately.
and that means telling Andie.
tell her what, exactly?
that her... that her mother was a succubus?
how old was Andie when her mother died?
12
were they close?
inseparable.
remind her of that, then.
I mean, talk about her.
memories you both share... the good stuff.
that's what Andie needs to be holding on to when you tell her.
but please hear me, Thomas.
you have to tell her now...
because any male she comes in contact with could be in mortal danger.
okay, seriously, dude?
you need to relax.
they can sense fear.
good. It keeps us on the same page.
God, this is uncomfortable.
you actually enjoy this?
Yeah, you know, uh...
when I'm on a horse, it's hard for me to think about much else.
and thinking is a bad thing?
sometimes. Yeah.
Oh, my God.
God, you jerk!
it is not funny!
what, you embarrassed?
why would I be embarrassed?
because in that moment before I opened my eyes,
I think you revealed how much you like me.
what? That's ridiculous.
and that... how you turn away?
that's how I know it's true.
whatever.
help me.
okay.
I... I... I need to go.
chief?
I ran those employee prints like you wanted.
we got a hit.
look, I told you I haven't seen the chief since I left over a year ago.
and now you think I killed him?
it's ridiculous. I've been helping you guys.
if you haven't seen the chief in over a year, how do you explain knowing about an S. U.V. he bought three months ago?
what? - Yeah.
your prints were all over the S. U.V.Chad.
no. - Yes.
okay, I... I... I've never been in the chief's car.
I wasn't even allowed on that property until you brought me in.
I'm telling you the truth. I swear.
same caliber as the shooter.
is that your gun, Chad?
Yeah. It's my gun. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
but I didn't kill him.
I did not kill him. You got to believe me. Please.
you're under arrest for the murder of chief David Phelps.
cuff him.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to an attorney.
dad. Daddy!
Hey! How you doing?
look what Dana and I made.
and we had ice cream, too.
Ah, well, it sounds like you had a perfect day.
Yeah. I'm gonna go put this in my room.
I can't live like this.
we came here to find a safe place.
and now, every phone call, every time I see a police car,
I worry.
I worry that our family is gonna be torn apart.
because of what I did?
how do I know this won't come back and haunt us?
we will not survive it.
I made a mistake.
I know that.
but I can get better.
can you trust me?
I want to trust you.
we're gonna be okay.
I'll make sure of it.
so, does this make us even?
this is way past even.
I'm not in the habit of asking guys out, so...
if I'm gonna do it, I might as well do it right.
this is doing it right.
listen, the cop in me has to ask.
why... you?
I think because yesterday you...you seemed little like a wounded bird.
so you felt sorry for me.
no.
I felt like we had something in common.
and...
uh, maybe fate brought us together to help each other.
maybe so.
well... that didn't take long.
to catch the chief's killer, I mean.
Oh. Yeah.
well, you know, they always make a mistake.
it's hard to imagine.
officer Taylor always struck me as such a nice young man.
you knew him?
in passing.
I was, uh, gonna get some tea for my wife.
but prices are a bit steep for me.
well, as my customers will tell you, it's worth every penny.
must be.
Chad Taylor was buying it, and he's been out of work for almost a year.
you know, aside from how he paid for it,
I was just... I was really wondering how he even got it, seeing how he was prohibited from entering The Gates.
I ship all over the world.
well, I,uh...
I am prohibited from accepting gifts.
I believe you said it was for your wife.
okay, for my wife.
thank you.
Devon, I need to know that if I do this, it stops.
Mrs. Cooper, the threats...
everything.
that is the agreement.
if you're lying, I'll kill you.
Yes.
I'm well aware.
Now...this may hurt a little.
you do feel... pain, don't you?
you can go to sleep tonight knowing this problem's solved.
but, Claire...do try to stay out of trouble.
it's bad!
we've got to get Lukas out of here.
he's dead.
I think I killed him.
how long you been awake?
not long.
liar.
alarm's not going off for another 10 minutes.
well, then, in that case, I say we kill the alarm and sleep in.
I got to work.
only half-day.
daddy daughter dance?
Dana only told me 15 times yesterday.
so... Take the whole day.
come on. We'll get the kids off to school, and then, uh, you and I can spend some time together.
I know what you're trying to do, sweetie.
I'm just trying to spend some quality time with my husband.
you're trying to keep my mind off of what today is.
honey, today is just a day... Like any other day.
no, it's not, sarah.
a year ago today, I shot that man.
I know.
but, honey, you did what you had to do.
and I thought we'd moved past all this.
I have.
fresh start. We leave chicago behind, right?
right.
honey, don't do this.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I promise.
you'll be fine.
just gonna take you a while to heal.
you want to tell me what happened out there?
uh, a hunter was out poaching.
we didn't see him till it was too late.
and how much did he see?
nothing. When he started shooting, we took off.
the woods were too dark. He couldn't catch us.
hard to imagine you running with a bullet in your leg.
must've been the adrenaline.
do you realize the kind of danger you could have put us all in?
we know it was stupid.
and since when do you run with these two?
I just -- I've had a lot of pent-up energy lately.
running helps me.
you want to blow off some steam?
be at practice this afternoon.
wait, I'm off suspension? - We'll see.
you want back on the team so bad, you better show me some of that energy you've got so much of.
I will. I swear.
now, You two get to school.
I'll take Lukas home.
you sure you told me everything that happened out there?
I'm sure.
do you think he knew we were lying?
lukas will stick to the story.
just don't freak out, okay?
what am I supposed to do?
I killed that guy, Lexie.
I killed him, and we just left him there.
you didn't have a choice!
it was awful but it was an accident.
morning.
good morning.
I'm thinking of cooking something special for dinner.
so, what are you in the mood for?
you.
definitely on the menu.
this is why I'm late for work.
sorry.
Oh, no, no, no.
I can't, uh -- I can't do dinner tonight.
Why?
chief's leaving early for the daddy daughter dance.
I got to cover for him.
Daddy/daughter.
sounds cute.
dinner tomorrow night?
I don't know. I might be persuaded.
Hey, uh, what time are you home?
you, uh, want to grab some dinner before the dance?
don't you have work?
I'm leaving early.
this dance only happens once a year, you know?
thank god.
you know, I still can't believe we're actually going.
well, why wouldn't we?
maybe because I'm not 12 anymore.
I mean, seriously, dad, don't you think I'm a little old for this?
does that mean that I'm too old?
are you saying that I'm old?
well, duh. You're a dad, so...
right, and you're my daughter, which makes us perfect candidates for the dance.
fine.
just, uh... Try not to embarrass me?
no promises.
good morning, sweetie.
Where's charlie? - Left for school early.
probably to see his girlfriend.
Ohh, charlie has a girlfriend?
will not discuss.
we're leaving for the dance at 6: 00 p. m.Sharp.
you can't be late. - I won't be late.
cause Emily and her dad are gonna be here at 6: 00.
they are? - Yeah.
the girls wanted to go to the dance together, and emily is gonna stay over after, so...
Hey, We don't want to be late.
have a good day.
love you. - Love you.
I'm really going to the dance with Dylan Radcliff?
Yes.
I don't understand why you two don't get along.
I don't know. I can't explain it.
my gut just says something's off with the guy.
well, Dylan and Claire are perfectly good people, and Dana and Emily are friends, so I think you can play nice for a few hours.
talk to you later.
don't forget that you and Emily need to be at the Monohans' at 6: 00.
I still don't see why we're carpooling.
because Emily wants to, and it wouldn't be such a terrible idea for you to spend some time with Nick.
well, I don't know what we're gonna talk about.
I don't think I'm currently a suspect in any of his cases.
the day is young.
I brushed my teeth. - Good girl. Let's go.
thanks for doing this.
you're a sport. - You owe me.
Bye.
before you, madam.
Hello, Christian. - Hey, Claire. How are you?
good. I'm good.
good. So, uh, have you decided about tonight?
I'm just not sure, Christian.
every time we go out, I feel like I'm taking such a risk.
you said Dylan was busy tonight.
he'll never even know you're gone.
what's going on?
nothing.
it's slow.
there's got to be something.
uh, okay. Well, there's this.
um, only phone call we got all morning.
Amy Patterson -- She lives outside the gates.
her husband, Stan, likes to go hunting in the woods around here.
she says last night they got into a fight, heot drunk, took off with his rifle.
she woke up this morning, and he still wasn't back.
why not call Franklin P. D?
because Buckley actually bought most of the land around the gates.
said wanted a buffer zone, whatever that means.
technically, the woods are still part of our jurisdiction.
all right. Well, let's get some deputies together.
we'll take out a search party.
honestly, sir, Stan does this kind of stuff all the time.
he'll turn up once he's slept it off.
or Stan shot himself in the foot and he's lying out there bleeding to death.
honestly, sir, if you knew Stan... I'll gather the troops.
you're here early.
thought we could hang out before class.
well, it has been almost 12 hours since we last saw each other, so...
seems longer.
you want to take a walk or something?
or something.
how long before you fainted did you start feeling dizzy?
he's never fainted before.
can we stop saying I fainted?
what were you doing right before you started feeling dizzy?
nothing.
just hanging out with Andie.
Yeah.
Oh, and have you two been hanging out a lot lately?
I - I guess.
who's "Andy"?
have I met him?
and by "hanging out," you wouldn't mean "making out," would you?
okay.
Andie's a girl, mom.
just... She's just a friend.
maybe a little more than a friend.
how much more? - Mom, no.
well, Charlie, from your symptoms,
I think you have what we called in my day "the kissing disease.
okay, mono?
so she gave him mono?
well, I'll have her checked out.
but until I get Charlie's bloodwork back, I want him home resting.
no school, no Andie, and definitely no kissing.
so...
Stan Patterson's wife said her husband left the house at approximately 11: 00 p. m.Last night, armed with a hunting rifle.
let's get ready to move out. We have a lot of ground to cover.
chief, I know you got way better tuff to do than go tromping around out there in the woods with us, man.
I'm gonna go along.
okay.
um... Everything all right?
Yeah.
what do you mean?
it just seems like something's bothering you.
no, I'm sorry.
I, uh...lot on my mind.
come on.
and then Mia said Ketsia told her that Lauren saw you faint right in the middle of class, so call me 'cause, uh, I'm really worried.
so you're off suspension.
it's just practice.
coach hasn't decided if he's gonna let me play yet.
he will.
the team needs you.
Yeah, well, we'll see.
so, uh, how have you been?
does it matter?
we're broken up, remember?
don't be like this.
I want us to be friends.
I don't need any more friends, Andie.
I guess not.
since when are you suddenly hanging out with her?
and Lukas.
I thought you couldn't stand the guy, and now you're all BFF?
Yeah, well, people change.
there are cops in the woods looking for the hunter.
we dragged Lukas out of there so fast,
I don't even rember if everyone had time to grab all their clothes or not.
okay. O-okay, I'll deal with it. Here. Take this stuff.
what are you going to do?
I've got to get to the body before they do and hide it.
Andie told me that she -- She broke up with Brett, but she didn't say anything about seeing this kid Charlie.
a teenage girl not talking to her father about her love life?
this has to be a first.
Yeah. I know. I know.
it's just happening so fast, you know?
so, is he gonna be okay?
well, Andie's succubus side hasn't fully matured, but it's only a matter of time now, Thomas.
I mean, you have to tell her about her mother, her condition, before Charlie or some other boy gets seriously hurt.
I know.
she's 15.
Thomas, I know this is hard.
do you want me to be there?
no, no.
I... I can do this myself.
it's not like I haven't rehearsed what I'm gonna say over and over in my head.
okay, so you'll talk to Andie today after school.
no. Tomorrow. - Thomas.
well, tonight's the dance.
I barely got her to go as it is.
look, I know it's selfish, but I don't care.
I want one more dance.
I want one more night with my little girl... While she still is my little girl.
hello.
I was just heading out to deliver these dresses.
the seamstress should be done with your daughters' outfits in just a few minutes.
Oh, thank you so much, Barbara.
I'm really sorry about the short notice, but it has been a crazy, crazy day.
Oh, no problem.
she had to come into the shop anyway.
we got backed up when Ellen dropped off some dresses to be let out -- Two whole sizes.
someone hasn't been watching their carbs.
Dana's dress will be waiting for you.
she is going to be so lovely at the dance.
thank you.
I take it Ellen and Barbara don't get along?
no, that's just Barbara.
she knows everything that goes on inside the Gates.
good to know.
what do you hunt down here anyway?
uh, deer, mostly.
occasional rabbit.
you got cameras out here?
never need any.
only people who come out here are hunters.
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
come on.
let's try back there.
what about this place over there?
Oh, chief.
looks like we got blood.
here too.
call Franklin.
get the C. S.U. Guys down here.
let them know we've got a possible crime scene.
dispatch, you got your ears on?
do me a favor -- Call up Franklin, tell them that we need a C. S.U.
lab sent over the results on that blood you found.
it's human.
everything else we're still working on.
all right, start calling around local hospitals, see if they admitted any john does.
if Stan is unconscious, maybe they haven't I. D.'d him yet.
okay. By the way, coach Ross is in your office.
okay.
coach.
Hey, Thanks for coming in.
I hope this isn't about one of my players.
well, it might be.
a few weeks ago, one of our surveillance cameras picked up a kid in a letterman's jacket outside the fence.
and then today, I found a Gates Academy T-shirt in the woods.
just wondering if you knew anything about any of your players going out there at night?
they don't mess around out there.
you sure?
I got a missing hunter, and I'm thinking maybe one of your kids might have seen something.
I doubt it, but I'll be happy to ask around.
I appreciate that.
Hi, Sarah.
how you doing?
Yeah, I'm okay. What's up?
I just wanted to make sure you remembered to pick up Dana's corsage.
uh, honey, of course I remembered.
I got it right here.
okay. - Okay. I love you.
you're sure it was the right place?
I'm telling you -- He's gone.
dead people don't just get up and walk away.
maybe he wasn't dead.
maybe I didn't kill him after all.
then where is he? And what if he saw us?
what if he saw us transform and tells people?
he'll sound crazy.
no one will believe him.
but coach will, and if he finds out we were lying, he could get us kicked out of the Gates.
I was, uh, actually just on my way to find you.
the, um, flower shop was closing and I saw you hadn't picked up Dana's corsage yet, so...
uh... It's been one of those days.
Sarah would have killed me if I came home without this.
Yeah, I barely made it under the wire myself.
Dana's looking forward to tonight.
Yeah, so is Emily.
well, uh, look, we'll, um, we'll probably pick you up 'round about 6: 00.
1899/12/31 0: 06: 00
you get the sense that our wives are setting us up?
well, at least it will give us something to talk about -- How to plot our revenge.
thanks again. - All right.
uh, Patterson's at county medical.
in the morgue.
a guy walking his dog found his body at the edge of franklin park.
all right. Come in, sit down.
what was the cause of death?
we're still waiting on the autopsy, but the coroner says some kind of animal attack.
well, if Stan was attacked outside the Gates, how the hell does he end up in Franklin park, which is almost 10 miles away?
I don't know.
coroner says he was torn up pretty bad.
would have at least been a blood trail.
C. S.U. Combed that whole area. Only blood was what we found.
no, something's not right.
lab come up with anything on the blood we found on the leaves?
not yet.
all right, call them. Push.
I don't think Stan was the only one out there last night.
mom, this is ridiculous.
Hey, you're not even supposed to be having visitors, you know.
although, if Andie hasn't caught it by now, I'm sure...
mom!
okay.
but I'm keeping my eye on you two.
sorry about that.
no, no.
she seems really nice.
uh, here.
I went a little heavy on the chick flicks, but they're my favorites.
secrets of my heart.
Oh, and you hate them, don't you?
no, no, they're great. Thanks.
and for coming over.
you're feeling okay, right?
Yeah. Peg gave me a clean bill of health.
I am 100% mono-free.
got to say, you don't look sick.
you look great.
you know, I feel great.
lately, I've been feeling better than great.
must be the company you're keepi.
maybe.
though, uh, it's too bad you have mono, or I'd show you exactlyhow good I'm feeling.
how long does mono last, again?
Yeah, well, uh, I got to get home and get changed anyway.
can't be late for the big dance.
come by after?
I don't know. Could be a rager.
you'd think I'd be able to figure this out by now.
here, I can help. - No, I got it.
I can do it. - I got it.
Nick! Nick, let me do it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
come on, you have a beautiful daughter waiting for you downstairs who is so excited about tonight.
I know.
I know.
I... I'm not gonna ruin her night.
Oh, It's your night, too.
look, stop beating yourself up over the past and go and enjoy the night.
okay?
you deserve it.
no.
I'm not so sure that I do.
W - what do you mean?
I shot him.
honey, I know. I know.
and I know that I will never understand what that must have been like.
I told I. A.I thought he had a gun, but I knew he didn't.
I said it was self-defense, but... ...it wasn't.
I lied to the department.
Sarah... I lied to you.
Wolcott was gonna walk.
D. A. Couldn't make a case.
he raped those women.
he killed that girl, and he was gonna walk.
and I knew it.
and he knew it.
and I kept thinking about those women, and... And what if it were you?
or Dana?
I killed him.
I killed him.
he was a monster.
and now I don't know if I'm any different.
we're gonna figure this out, okay?
right now, you ju--You just need to go downstairs and take your daughter to the dance, okay?
we'll talk when you get back.
dad! Hurry up! They're here!
okay? Come on.
dirty, two olives.
it's been a long time since I've had a proper martini.
the perils of suburban life, huh?
glad you came.
well, I nearly turned around twice. But...
here you are.
it's good to see you.
I know it's wrong, but when I am with you, Christian...I feel like my old self again.
Yeah, I liked the old Claire.
I did, too.
Hey, sweetie.
um, listen, I just wanted to call and tell you I'm gonna be even later than I thought.
no problem. We'll just meet up after the nc
I think it is so great you volunteered to take pictures for them.
seriously. It -- it's awesome.
give everybody a chance to see how talented you are.
you are so sweet.
and so patient.
I know that it's taken me too long to find my own place.
you can stay with me as long as you want, okay? You know that.
in case you didn't notice, I kinda like having you around.
Yeah, I noticed.
thank you, Marcus.
for what?
for helping me.
for caring.
this last year's been... It's been pretty rough, and, um...
well, you're the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
I just...wanted to tell you that.
everything okay?
Yeah, yeah. Everything's fine.
I- I just -- I've got to get ready, so, um, be safe, and I'll see you soon.
Yeah. Okay. I'll see you later.
okay. - All right. Bye.
so, uh, remember when you could smoke these inside?
Oh, I never smoke.
well, sometimes after a few drinks.
you're gonna join me, aren't you?
you are such a bad influence.
that's what they say.
how funny running into you here.
and I see you've met Christian.
uh, you know each other?
Oh, yes.
and you two know each other?
Yes. We both live in the Gates.
I had no idea you ventured out this way.
I guess with Dylan and Emily at the dance...
it's a perfect opportunity to come out and catch up with an old friend.
well, I better be going.
it was nice to meet you, Christian.
so good to meet you, too.
and, Claire... I'm sure I'll see you soon.
take care.
who exactly was that?
just the worst possible person that I could have run into.
how long did you say you and Claire lived in the Gates?
um, about six years now.
we moved here right after we adopted Emily.
can't think of a better place to raise a family.
is that what brought you here?
well, I've been a cop 15 years, and I have seen things that no father should see.
you know, you want to protect your children, but at the end of the day, sometimes it's just you against the world.
you know, I remember when Emily was only a few months old.
I woke up one night, and I thought I heard her on the baby monitor.
I went into her room, and she was just sleeping.
and, uh, yeah.
I stood there, and in that moment, I knew there was nothing I wouldn't do, nothing I wouldn't give up, to keep that little girl safe.
we made an offer on the house the next day.
kids change you.
that's true.
you okay? - Yeah.
lab results. We found some wolves' blood in the woods earlier.
that's weird.
probably not many wolves in chicago.
different kind of wolves.
look, Dylan, I,uh, I just want to say,
I - I know we haven't exactly gotten off on the right foot.
Oh, you think?
you were just doing your job.
Yeah, well, sometimes I overdo it.
clearly, I was -- I was wrong about you.
well, I appreciate that.
I think the Gates are lucky to have you.
you're a good cop. You have good instincts.
Yeah, well, sometimes the instincts that make me a good cop don't make me such a great friend.
come on, let's go.
well, you know what?
maybe it will be different here.
I have some young ladies here who would like pictures with their handsome fathers.
how about it? - Yeah, yeah.
okay, big smiles.
...the victim of a vicious animal attack.
now, the police have identified the body as Stan Patterson.
with his rifle found nearby, police suspect that Mr. Patterson was hunting near Franklipark when he was mauled by what the coroner believes was a large wolf.
coach?
look, I know I missed practice this afternoon.
I'm sorry.
is your mother here?
she's working late. What's wrong?
what's wrong is that you're an idiot.
you think I didn't know you lied to me about that poacher?
I don't understand. They found that guy in Franklin park.
and how do you think he got there?
after you left this morning, I went out to the woods and found his body right where you left him, out in the open for just anybody to stumble across.
and I could smell you all over him.
you lled that man and didn't even have the smarts enough to clean up after yourself.
it was a mistake. He shot Lukas.
you could have expose us all!
the rules are in place for a reason!
I'm pack Beta.
I should report you to the council.
and if it wasn't for your mother, I would.
I'm sorry.
it's too late for that.
you're off the team.
permanently.
but, coach...
if you want to destroy your life, fine.
but you're not taking the pack down with you.
looks like I'm not the only dad with excellent powers of persuasion, huh?
we're all here under a "one dance only" protest.
well, you're beautiful anyway.
you have to say that.
no, no, I could have carefully skirted the issue.
just happens to be true.
every year you remind me more and more of your mother.
she'd be so proud of you.
for coming to the dance?
for everything.
I miss her too, dad.
did you see the look on her face?
by this time tomorrow, every single woman in the Gates is gonna know that I was out with you.
how much longer until Dylan finds out that I've been lying to him?
it's not too late. I could take care of it.
No!
Christian, this isn't some anonymous kill.
I know this woman!
I can't keep doing this.
you could always leave Dylan.
what?
no.
I... I love Dylan.
he's forcing you to lead this double life.
you're lying, and you're scared.
and it's all because your own husband refuses to accept who you truly are.
that's not love.
love is about compromise.
you make it seem like I have some terrible life.
well, I don't.
I am happy.
the dance is almost over.
I need to get home.
I'm going out for a bit.
one of my friends has mono.
doesn't that suck?
Andie, we need to talk.
can it wait until tomorrow?
no.
I guess it can't.
dad, what's wrong?
see, I-I need to tell you something.
it's about your mother.
she was a very special woman.
and she had these abilities.
been looking for you.
did you hear where they found the poacher?
we're in the clear.
where is everyone?
keeping it low.
I think we've all had enough excitement for a while.
come on. Bunch of us are going over to lukas' for a movie.
I'm going running.
no one runs until Lukas is better.
says who? - Lukas is alpha.
we don't go without him. That's the rule.
well, I'm done with the rules.
Brett, what's wrong?
what's wrong?
Patterson is dead.
I should have stopped, but I didn't, and now I've ruined everything.
he would've killed Lukas!
he would've killed all of us!
you know that better than anyone!
please, Brett.
come with me.
I'm sorry.
I can't.
everything okay?
Yeah, yeah. Dana's having a great time.
wanted to see how you were.
I'm okay.
look, honey... I know I should have told you months ago.
I was afraid if you knew who I was and what I was capable of, you couldn't stay with me.
Nick, I've always known who you really are.
baby, you are a good father, and a good husband, and a good, honorable man.
we're gonna move past this.
I promise.
you know how much I love you?
you know how much I love you?
I'll see you in a bit.
okay.
Hey, chief.
you can call me Nick. - Okay.
thanks for taking the photos.
Yeah, happy to do it.
everyone here has just been so kind.
it's my little way of giving back.
you gonna take off?
Yeah, oh, but, uh, Marcus wanted me to snag you.
he's coming by to pick me up, and he had a quick question.
he said it would just take a second.
all right, let's go. - Okay.
did he say what time he'd be here?
my name isn't Teresa. It's Amanda.
Oh, you remember the name.
that was my brother you murdered.
into the woods. - Okay.
into the woods now!
Wayne didn't try to shoot you.
he didn't even own a gun.
you lied to everyone, and you thought you could get away with it.
what have you done with Marcus?
nothing.
I just -- I used him to get inside the Gates, to get access to you, to your family.
you leave my family alone.
I had actually planned to kill them first.
your son... And your daughter, your wife.
one by one, I was gonna strip you of your family like you stripped me of mine.
the dance was just a perfect opportunity to catch you off-guard.
and unarmed.
but as you die, know that I'm going back inside for your daughter.
no.
no.
this ends here with me.
what did you -- What did you do to her?
put the gun down and I'll explain.
put the gun down.
Nick, we don't have time for this.
Emily and Dana, they're gonna come looking for us soon.
you have to go inside, get our daughters, and bring them to your house.
what are you?
I will take care of Teresa's body, okay?
no one ever needs to know about this.
what are you?
you know exactly what I am.
I remember a time that we'd just be going out about now.
well, we've grown up since then, haven't we?
so, are you too exhausted from your big night out, Mr. Grown-up?
or can you still muster up some of that... youthful energy?
we need to talk.
where were you tonight?
I was out... with my wife.
any witnesses see you out with your wife?
Yes. About 300.
we were at a benefit for the children's hospital.
Why? What's this about?
Barbara Jansen is dead.
she was killed.
by a vampire.
M. E.'s gonna record the punctures as ritualistic fetishism... For now.
can I...
this is definitely a vampire bite.
but it doesn't look like it was a feeding.
there's still blood in her body.
was this about killing her?
well, I can't answer as to what it was about.
well, I hope you can answer something.
right now, you're the closest thing to a suspect that I have.
hold on. Look.
these puncture wounds - they're not mine.
they're too narrow.
I can prove that to you if you'd like.
you tell me it's a vampire, but it's not you.
who is it, then? Claire?
she was with me.
how many more of you are there?
there's a small community living inside the Gates.
but, Nick, listen, it's very unlikely one of them would have killed this woman.
we moved here for the same reason you did...
to raise our families and to try to live a normal life.
we follow strict rules, the most important one being "do not hunt inside the Gates.
well, one of you has.
I'm gonna need the names, Dylan.
no, I... no, I can't do that.
90% of the people who live in the Gates...they have no idea the rest of us are not like them.
and I'd like to keep it that way.
in fact, maybe you should let us deal with this.
let you deal with it?
that's not how it works, Dylan.
how are you going to arrest a vampire?
will bullets work?
guess I'm on my own.
Hi. You know who this is.
and you know what to do.
thank you.
Christian, it's me again.
we need to talk.
call me back.
Hi. You've reached lieutenant Evelyn Williams at the Miami-Dade police department.
leave a message.
Hey, Evelyn. It's Nick Monohan.
listen, I was wondering if you still had that spot open in your homicide desk.
I may be looking for a change.
call me back.
Yes, chief?
I need you to do something for me.
absolutely, sir.
I'm afraid 's gotten a little worse.
it's a good thing I've finished your medication.
two pills, three times a day.
Oh. Uh, okay.
now, there are some possible side effects you should be aware of - things like nausea, dizziness, aphasia, blurred vision...
a-are you sure this stuff is safe?
Yes.
but I will need to keep a close eye on you.
look, I don't know.
I mean, I don't know if I should take these.
Andie, that rash on your back...
that is not a good sign.
the more depleted your bod gets, the larger it'll grow, and the more you're gonna feel compelled to find a source of...Life-force to replenish yourself.
we don't want that to happen.
so, please, take the medicine.
uh...uh, yeah.
okay.
of course.
chief Monohan.
please come.
I just don't understand.
how did this happen?
well, there were a number of injuries, but we're still not sure of the exact cause of death.
how long did you know Barbara?
ever since she moved into the Gates, almost six years ago.
we used to go shopping almost every day.
we wouldn't buy much. We just liked looking.
we had the exact same taste.
after a while, we thought just, "why not open up our own dress shop?" You know.
surround ourselves with the things we love.
when was the last time you spoke with her?
we closed up shop around 9: 00 last night.
Barbara wanted to stay late to go over invoices, but I was tired, and I left.
that was the last time I saw her.
um, did you go home?
no. I went to the Windrush Grill.
and that's the worst part.
I wasn't really tired.
I just didn't want to do those invoices.
was Barbara having any - any problems?
were there people she didn't get along with?
no, not at all.
she even got along with her ex-husband.
does he live here in the Gates?
Alex Dupree on Terry Lane.
okay.
thank you very much, Ms. Bennett.
and, again, I'm sorry for your loss.
chief Monohan, please, whoever did this, find them.
I'll do my best.
so, I know that most of you were really close to Barbara.
are you sure you don't want to postpone the meeting?
I mean, I would completely understand.
no.
Barbara wouldn't want that.
what?
the only thing she loved more than good gossip was being the gossip.
so, what have you heard?
Oh, um...
well, the... the cause of death is still under investigation, so there's nothing really to gossip about.
well, then, we should get started.
Oh, well, shouldn't we wait for the other committee members?
we've got Lynn, Claire, and Vanessa.
we actually operate independently when it comes to events...
a little friendly competition.
we sponsor the golf tournament at the club while Claire, Vanessa and friends conduct an art auction.
two events, double the take.
now, the problem is that, with all the heavy rains last week, the golf course is a bog.
Oh.
well, we've still got the art auction, right?
and we can just help them with that.
that doesn't work for us.
why not?
what Charlotte is trying to say is that in an effort to keep the competitive spirit alive, we need to come up with something else...
something that will bring in more than a silly little art auction.
and given your experience in Chicago, we thought you might have some fresh ideas.
can I help you?
I'm chief Monohan.
I didn't know if anyone was home.
I didn't see a car in the driveway.
Oh. I send them out to be detailed every Thursday.
my ex-wife always told me, "appearance is everything in the Gates.
Mr. Dupree, we should talk.
I cat believe it.
are you and Barbara on speaking terms?
our divorce was completely amicable.
we're still friends.
well, if you got along so well...
Barbara was a...
a free spirit.
she wanted things I wasn't equipped to give her.
it was clear she was not happy, so...
I'm sorry I have to ask you this, Mr. Dupree, but where were you last night around 10: 30?
here. Asleep.
do you know if Barbara was seeing anyone?
not any one person in particular.
free spirit?
I heard she spent a lot of time at this one club...
um, the red door.
all right.
I am sorry.
appreciate it.
I'll see myself out.
what the hell did you do?
and, oh, I'm - what are you talking about?
Barbara Jansen is dead.
murdered. By a vampire.
you think I had something to do with it?
that time that she saw us here together,
I was afraid she'd say something.
and you said,"I will take care of it.
no. And then you said to leave her alone, so...I left her alone.
come here.
I would never do anything to jeopardize what we have together.
what we have together is an arrangement.
we can't do this anymore.
I've tried to forget about you.
I-I moved to Berlin.
went to Paris for a year.
but I always ended up coming back here.
Claire, you and I both know it always should have been us.
don't call me again.
honestly, I just give up.
I've been trying to come up with new ideas for a fundraiser, but they gave me less than two days' notice.
I swear it feels like I'm just being set up to fail.
welcome to suburbia, where everyone uses their perfectly manicured nails to scratch each other's eyes out.
you know what else I don't get?
what's with the whole "we" and "they" thing?
it's like Karen and her friends don't get along with Claire and her friends.
but why?
there's no reason for it.
why not have your fundraiser here?
we can give manicures, pedicures.
I'll donate my time and the supplies.
and I've got an amazing new anti-aging face peel that I'd love to show off.
you know, we could have the art auction outside.
pampering and culture. I think it's a great idea.
you would do that?
anything for a good cause.
was I speeding?
look, I understand there's only so much you're willing to do to help me out.
but what if Barbara were killed by a vampire from outside the Gates hunting on the inside?
would that be something you'd want to know about?
Absolutely.
Barbara used to be a regular at a place in the city called the red door.
the bartender gave me a list of names of people she hung out with, guys she dated.
you recognize any of those names?
I'm sorry.
Nick, just so you know, my people are looking into this, as well.
and if they get there first, then it will be too late.
Hey, andie.
Hey.
so, did you pick somebody to do your poetry essay on for class?
Charlotte bronte.
Wh... okay. That... that's not fair.
Jane Eyre" is my favorite book.
Mm. Then it's too bad this essay is on her poems.
look, this is the only copy, but we could share.
study at my house Saturday?
uh...Yeah.
um, I don't know.
I promise... just studying.
self-control, remember?
right.
self-control.
Hey, sweetie, I'm gonna get my usual table, okay?
you always were a creature of habit.
what are you doing here, man?
come here.
Oh, my... how long has it been?
uh, about seven years.
seven years.
we need to talk.
so, what brought you back to this part of the world?
Oh, chasing love. You know how it is.
Yeah, well, I do.
you've never had a good thing to say about love.
how did you put it when Claire and I got married?
it was, um...
Yeah, it was "depressingly mundane.
Hey, surely you didn't come here to talk about love.
look, I,um...
I saw your name on a list of suspects in a murder case.
a woman named Barbara Jansen...
she was killed inside the Gates by one of us.
apparently she was a regular here.
well, you know, if it's the Barbara I'm thinking of, then, sure, I met her once or twice.
but, Dylan, come on. It wasn't me.
you got to be kind of stupid to kill inside the Gates.
everyone knows that.
Yeah, most do.
so, speaking of, how is life on the inside?
you know what? Life is good.
Emily is thriving.
Claire you would not recognize.
she... she cooks.
Claire cooks?
come on, man.
come on.
you should have stayed in touch.
Yeah, well, I assumed you and Claire wanted to leave your old life behind, and that's what I...am.
I'm your old life.
you're my oldest friend.
Yeah.
here's to old friends, Dylan.
chief Monohan.
Hi. This is Mrs. Davidson. Hi, Mrs. Davidson.
someone hit my car.
well, when did this happen?
sometime Wednesday.
how bad is the damage?
pretty bad. I'd like to make a report.
well, I'm a little short-staffed right now.
how about I send someone down to take your report as soon as I can?
okay. Okay. Thanks, Mrs. Davidson.
okay, bye-bye.
got you.
expecting someone else?
Christian, what are you do...
surprise.
look what old dinosaur.
Dylan invited me for dinner.
what a surprise.
that's wonderful.
any blurred vision?
dizziness?
nausea?
uh, no. Nothing. I-I feel great.
I'm not surprised.
you haven't been taking the pills.
I-I...
don't lie to me, Andie.
your pupils should be slightly dilated.
and there should be mild swelling in your lymph glands from the prolaxifil.
I-I'm sorry.
why are you apologizing to me?
you're the one who's gonna suffer if you don't treat this seriously.
I am being serious.
look, it's just the dizziness and the nausea and aphasia.
look, I don't even know what the last one means, but if it's like the others, I don't want it.
Andie, this medication is the only way to keep yourself and the people you care about safe.
that's not true.
my mom and dad don't use any medicine, and they were fine.
Oh, honey, I'm afraid you don't have all the information.
look, you know what? I know they had to work at it.
but they controlled it.
and if they could do it, then so can I.
Andie, wait.
and then your mother proceeds to drink this Irishman under the table.
poor bastard didn't know what had hit him, right?
language, Christian. - What, I can't say "Irishman"?
so, Christian, this love you've been chasing - where did you meet her?
in the grocery store, of all places.
Yeah, I helped her escape.
she was trapped.
frozen foods.
she was not.
she was. I had to pull her out of the freezer.
she was cold.
you're funny, Mr. Harper.
Hey, don't call me that.
you call me "uncle Christian," okay?
did you know that I saw your mother before your father did?
I s about to introduce myself to your beautiful mother, and then your father - he cuts right in front of me.
he practically elbowed me aside.
that is because true love is worth fighting for.
I agree.
you, young lady, have stayed up way past your bedtime.
I'll take her up.
no, I'll do it. You two catch up.
good night, Uncle Christian.
good night, sweetie.
are you gonna come back?
Oh, you bet I will.
come, let's go. Come on. Come on.
Aah!
Aah!
how dare you come here?
look, I didn't plan this, okay? This just happened.
we keep happening.
maybe it's time we just stop fighting it.
I said,"it's over.
after tonight, I never want to see you again.
is that clear?
it's awfully quiet down there.
should I be concerned about you two?
Mm. Oh, what you should be concerned about is that '78 pinot I just spotted in your wine room.
Ah, yes, that is a problem, yes.
I'll bring it out.
I followed him for two days straight.
Mr. Radcliff met with at least a dozen people around the Gates.
that's great work, Eddie.
stop.
go.
again.
that's Gloria.
Oh, my goodness.
Devon, you took years off.
next.
have you heard anything more about what happened to Barbara?
not a thing.
but aren't you worried?
I mean, the fact that it happened here... inside?
I have learnt one thing, Vanessa...
that living here can only protect you from so much.
Mrs. Hammond, you have such a keen eye.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea, Sarah.
what are you talking about? We're making a fortune.
Devon doesn't do anything for free.
it's just not always easy to see the cost until it's too late.
Karen, I think you worry too much.
who's next?
with all the sunscreen you use,
I'm sure a facial would do wonders.
silver choker?
Gloria, I have reason to believe you weren't entirely honest with me in our last interview about who you are, what you are.
what I am isn't illegal. At least not here anyways.
no, but it has direct bearing on my case...
on the facts surrounding Barbara's murder.
it's just that Barbara didn't like me to talk about it.
and since we weren't together anymore,
I didn't think it mattered.
you were lovers?
I tried to make her happy.
and we were.
but then it became obvious that I was just an experiment.
she moved out and started dating men again.
better?
so now you know all my secrets.
Gloria, if Barbara broke up with you, that gives you motive for murder.
and there were teeth marks.
no, it wasn't like that. I loved her.
I went back to the shop that night.
I hated myself for leaving her to do those invoices all alone.
but when I got back there, something had happened.
there was so much blood.
I heard someone run out, but all I could think about was to try to save her.
do you know how a vampire is created?
we bite someone, feed off of them just enough to bring them to the edge of death.
then we give our own blood back to them to seal the bond.
that's what I tried to do for Barbara.
but it was too late.
I'm sorry. I really am.
but I need to take you down to the station.
Oh, no. That can't happen.
let me go.
I promise I will disappear, and you will never see me again.
no, I cannot do that.
look, I don't want to hurt you.
Aah! Don't!
you might as well shoot me because if you try to take me in, I'm dead anyways.
the others will kill me for this.
Gloria, stop.
No! Please! Let me go!
you son of a bitch.
you played me this whole time. You had me do your grunt work.
Nick, hold on a second. What are you talking about?
Gloria. I was bringing her in for questioning, and you took her.
chief, a lady keeps calling about her dented car.
not now, Eddie.
they took Gloria Bennett?
Nick, I had nothing to do with that.
Oh, really?
you had nothing to do with that?
look, I warned you, okay?
if they're convinced Gloria broke the rules, they're gonna kill her.
Gloria never confessed to the murder.
she said she was trying to save Barbara.
the coroner found blood in Barbara's throat and her mouth.
blood that didn't match her own blood type.
she was trying to turn Barbara.
well, that means Gloria was telling the truth.
which means I'm back to square one.
anyone could have done this.
I need more time, Dylan.
I'll see what I can do to stall them, okay?
Charlotte Bronte's life was so sad and lonely.
you know, she constantly searched for love, and all she ev found were the sickness and death of everyone she was ever close to.
but that doesn't mean she didn't understand love, or experience it.
sometimes I think about the danger associated with truly connecting with someone.
that's what makes it so much more... - tragic?
worthwhile.
some have won a wild delight, by daring wilder sorrow.
could I gain thy love tonight, I'd hazard death tomorrow.
no... my will shall yet control "thy will, so high and free, "and love shall tame that haughty soul...
Yes, tenderest love for me.
Hey, are... are you okay?
I'm... I'm fine.
um...
I-it's, uh...Beautiful.
Andie, I...
um...
...we're doing good, right?
just studying.
Yeah.
studying.
Mrs. Davidson called again about her car.
she said that you promised to send someone out.
Yeah. Tell her I'm busy, Eddie.
it's just that she was hoping to get an official accident report from Wednesday night before she gets her car repaired and detailed.
wednesday night?
where did she say this accident happened?
main street. Why?
that's where B&G dress shop is.
wednesday night was when Barbara Jansen was murdered.
what are you thinking, chief?
I'm thinking she's not the only one who's particular about her car, Eddie.
Charlie, are you okay?
Yeah.
what happened?
I'm so sorry.
it's not your fault.
there must be something wrong with me.
no. It... it's not you.
it's me.
I'm so sorry.
I have to go.
Andie, wait.
chief Monohan.
you surprised me.
I called the body shop.
they said that you do have your cars detailed every Thursday.
only this time, you had them take a dent out of the bumper.
right, right.
hit-and-run right here in the Gates.
unbelievable.
they also said that they buffed some green paint off your fender.
now, that matches the color of Mrs. Davidson's car that was hit outside the B&G dress shop the night Barbara was murdered.
you lied to me, Mr. Dupree.
you were in that dress shop with Barbara that night.
something happened...
something that made you leave in a hurry and clip Mrs. Davidson's car.
was it an accident?
did you plan on killing her?
no.
I didn't want to hurt her.
I went to the shop to get her back.
she wasn't interested.
she went to walk out, and I grabbed her.
after she fell, I tried to help her. I tried.
but I heard somebody coming through the back of the store, and I panicked.
I didn't want her to die.
it was just an accident.
it was all just a stupid accident.
Alex Dupree, you're under arrest for the murder of Barbara Jansen.
Dylan, I found Barbara's killer.
please tell me Gloria's okay.
so, how did it go today?
it looked like everyone was very busy.
$20, 000 and change.
unbelievable.
well done. Mwah.
it was all Sar.
actually, it was Devon.
we really couldn't have done it without her.
anything for the Gates.
it's the only good thing that came out of my marriage.
we should go.
Oh, no. Stay.
after all, your infidelity built this spa.
I paid for the remodel by selling my wedding ring.
the necklace you gave me in Acapulco went to the plumbing.
your boat... our gold-plated serving ware.
just think, Vanessa, when you catch Frank cheating on you, you can open your own real-estate agency.
Sarah, thank you again.
pathetic.
and yet predictable.
it's a shame.
I was almost starting to like you.
Sarah, wait.
I'm sorry. I...
I shouldn't have said that.
why did you?
did you see when... when Frank kissed Vanessa right here?
Yeah.
he used to do that to me.
what happened between you two?
Frank and I were married for a long time.
but then one night, we went to our favorite restaurant, and I could sense this...tension.
so when Frank went to the washroom,
he was an old friend.
I asked him what was wrong, and...
...he told me.
he said that Frank had been there, um, a few days earlier...
with Vanessa.
turned out he'd been cheating on me for years.
and everyone knew.
the whole town.
I asked for a divorce that night.
it was our 10th anniversary.
Devon, I'm so sorry.
look, I'm not fishing for pity or sympathy.
I've been working things out, and the truth is...
I'm gonna be just fine.
chief Monohan.
Oh, come in.
I just want to thank you for saving my life.
well, I'm glad I could help.
you're a good man.
and we need that here.
thank you.
so, what happens now?
well, I think we can work things out so Gloria can stay.
and I owe that all to you.
I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance.
you did plenty.
you've gained a lot of goodwill, helping Gloria like that.
that's good to know.
if your people find out what you did for me with Teresa...
what, killing inside the Gates?
there's only one punishment for that.
I owe you.
you have one new message.
Nick, hey, it's Evelyn Williams
I was surprised to get your message.
but if you're interested,
I think there's a way we can make things work.
call me Monday.
I'm going to be just fine.
chief Monohan.
your phone call sounded serious.
what can I help you with?
let's cut the crap, Buckley.
when you hired me for this job, there were a few important details you left out.
like what?
the Radcliffs, Gloria Bennett, all the others like them.
now, if I had told, would you have accepted the position?
hell, would you have even believed me?
you let me my family move in here.
you put them in danger.
that's not how I see it.
I gave you an opportunity.
which you didn't have a whole lot of, coming out of that situation in Chicago.
now, honestly, Nick, I mean...
where are you gonna go?
Florida?
how do you know about Florida?
my top priority is the security of the families in the Gates...
all of the families.
it is my job to ensure that their secrets remain safe.
protect the secrets, you protect the families.
I wouldn't be able to protect your family anymore if you were to move out of the Gates.
are you threatening my family?
it's concerned advice.
where is he? Inside?
okay, thanks.
what's going on?
thanks for coming by.
I have something that I think both of you should see.
you see, gentlemen, everyone has secrets that need protecting.
Christian. Come on.
don't call me again.
you have to tell her now, because any male she comes in contact with could be in mortal danger.
they have no idea what your tea is doing to them.
what's with the whole "we" and "they" thing?
welcome to suburbia, where everyone uses their perfectly manicured nails to scratch each other's eyes out.
I'll need a vial of your blood - For the spell, of course.
you see, gentlemen, everyone has secrets that need protecting.
Nick, help me. Nick.
Nick, help me.
I'm sorry, nick, but we can't let you leave.
what do you mean?
come on, claire. It'll be fun.
I'm having it catered by that spanish place.
there'll be tapas, sangria.
it's really important to me.
good.
I will see you around noon.
seems like your little housewarmingpool party is shaping up to be quite an event.
well, I just hope everyone gets along.
this place can be so cliquey sometimes.
it's like karen won't talk to claire.
Devon won't talk to vanessa. It's like a whole...
do I sense an ulterior motive?
Yeah, stop detecting. I'm inviting lots of people.
hey... Did you get any sleep?
you had nightmares again, huh?
I'm fine.
this job was supposed to be less stressful than chicago.
I'm fine.
and I got to go.
eyes ope always wear your vest. Call for backup. I love you.
I love you, too.
Claire, just go to the party and try not to let karen crezski get under your skin.
Karen and her lot.
there is nothing worse than that rancid dog smell.
all right, well, just go. Play nice. We need to be normal right now.
what, right away?
how clandestine.
isn't this a bit paranoid?
you saw buckley's home movies. You ask me, we haven't been paranoid enough.
what do you propose we do about it?
he's got something on us. I say we get something on him.
make it an even playing field.
check that out.
w. r.Harrison, the developer who co-founded the gates with buckley.
that's before my time.
Harrison dies a few years after the gates opens.
falls down some stairs.
but right here... Coroner's inquest.
something about it. It's a little too - it's a little too neat.
vague suspicions of murder - That's not enough to go on, is it?
so we dig.
Dylan, we dig till we get something better. You're on the gates board.
that gives you access to bank statements, to contracts.
right?
plus... Dylan... You have your community.
well, hold on. Buckley is not a vampire.
and if I start digging around the board, buckley will find out.
look, it's a risk we take.
otherwise, we got buckley's threats hanging over our heads for the rest of our lives.
you want that?
all right. All right. I'm in. I'm in.
all right. I'll be touch.
Hey, Dr. Peg.
Yeah, look, I'm - Look, I'm sorry to call you on vacation, it's just I'm getting some nasty side effects from those pills.
keep taking them till you get back?
I don't know if I handle can.
I - I don't know if I can handle that.
okay.
Bye.
I've been looking for you.
I'm late for class.
Andie, I-I just want to know why you're avoiding me.
and - I thought we had something, and things got weird the other night, - and now you're just... - You wouldn't understand.
try me.
I can't.
beastlyboy.
you're exactly what I've been looking for.
chief monohan.
what an unexpected pleasure.
here for our men's facial?
a little massage?
uh, actually I wanted to ask you a few questions about your ex-husband.
please tell me he's in lots and lots of trouble.
that's him. W.r. Harrison.
he was a friend of my father's.
he didn't have any children of his own, so... He sort of doted on me.
I introduced him to frank, back when I still had no idea what kind of man my husband really was.
Frank had big dreams but small pockets and no connections.
that's where uncle billy came in.
that's what I used to call him.
so, how would you describe the relationship between frank and Mr. Harrison?
did they get along?
you're fishing.
what are you trying to catch?
what's out there?
I can tell you this.
Frank and uncle billy had a huge falling out right before he died.
looking back, I think maybe uncle billy learned about frank and vanessa's affair.
things between them got... Ugly.
and then uncle billy had his accident, and frank got everything he wanted.
full control over the gates and 100% of the profits.
nobody found that suspicious?
uncle billy had a bad hip, and I was young and naive.
by the time I found out what frank was capable of...
well, who'd listen to the ravings of a scorned woman?
Oh, you brought a quiche.
are you okay?
Yes, I'm... Perfect.
thank you so much for coming.
this really does mean a lot to me.
Oh, I wouldn't have missed it.
although I may not stay long.
I'm a little bit sensitive to the sun, and I'm afraid I don't swim.
well, ally?
have you seen some of the outfits?
because trust me, none of these women are going anywhere near the water.
Hey, leigh! You came.
Yeah, and I brought margaritas.
figured you'd need 'em.
well, I'm so glad.
I didn't think you'd be into this sort of thing.
watching stressed-out trophy wives get catty with underfed divorcs?
who doesn't love that?
Yeah, I was kind of hoping this party would bring people together.
what a beautiful backyard.
I brought venison.
Dacia, let's start up the grill.
I should get out of the sun.
you invited claire radcliff and karen crezski to the same party?
yeah?
Oh, this is gonna be good.
so, what'd you dig up on buckley?
okay.
look, devon may think buckley killed harrison to get control of the gates' profits, okay, but the numbers don't add up.
if anything, buckley is underpaid for his position.
it's - It's all very proper.
these are public records?
no, better than that.
I paid a visit to buckley's c. f.o.lloyd foster.
now, he's been here since day one.
the lion's share of the profits from the gates, they don't go to buckley, they don't go to devon, they don't go to anyone else.
instead, 80% ends up here... The gates trust.
so, killing harrison doesn't free up a penny for devon or buckley.
no. No motive, no murder.
well, at least that's what they say on "castle.
what if it's not about money?
Devon said harrison and buckley had a falling out before he died.
what if... What if buckley kills harrison over anger?
well, how do we prove that?
guy's been here since the beginning, right?
maybe he has some insight.
Hey, andie, are you okay?
I- I-i'm fine.
you're not fine. You're acting strange.
look, I told you, I - I'm fine.
we're not together anymore.
leave me alone.
venison?
bloody rare - Just the way you like it.
you're in an interesting mood.
full moon?
okay, can you explain that?
some things are beyond explanation.
it's a nice effort.
I can't remember the last time anyone brought those two and their friends together.
so, how are you?
is the gates everything you've been hoping for?
Yeah. No, this place is amazing.
it's just the... ...people need a little work.
I'll be right back.
okay.
you know, she doesn't bite.
I'll take your word for it.
look, claire... I may be pushing.
I do that.
and to be honest, when I first met karen, I really didn't like her that much, either.
but she's a good person.
just go over there and break the ice.
for me.
I will say hello.
I'll be cordial.
but if she's starts with any of her usual nonsense...
you are the best. Thank you.
look!
all my favorite ladies in one place.
you invited devon?
yeah?
it's hot today. Who's ready to jump in the water?
I appreciate what you're trying to do here.
but I have to go. I can't do this.
a
I understand harrison and buckley had a, uh - A disagreement before harrison died.
was it over the affair with vanessa?
that's the rumor.
see, harrison was very fond of devon, so if he learned that buckley had been unfaithful...
apocalyptic. - It's must've gotten ugly.
whatever the issue, harrison was so distressed, he threatened to shut down the gates.
he could do that?
he had me working on the details.
and then... - And then harrison died.
so sad, the way they found him.
facedown at the bottom of a staircase.
Lloyd, I'm gonna need access to the records from that year.
a copy of harrison's will.
Absolutely.
I'm telling you, dating in the internet era is a revelation.
I get 100 messages a day.
eliminate the losers, there's still dozens of handsome, successful men who'd kill to meet me.
Karen, darling. You should give it a whirl.
no need to grow old sad and alone.
something wrong?
nothing. It's just this entire party was a huge mistake.
I just want everyone to get along.
that's because you're sweet.
you know, nick came into my shop today.
he was aing about frank. So mysterious.
well, I'm sure he had his reasons.
but what were they? That's the question.
what cookie jar did frank stick his grubby hands into this time?
and more to the point, is he going to get caught... For once?
well, nick doesn't really talk to me about his cases.
and if he did, you wouldn't say anything, right?
confidentiality.
I almost forgot.
I brought you something.
my special tea.
a lile calm in a difficult day.
last chance. Anyone?
venison?
isn't that a little... Obvious?
suit yourself.
so, you found this company in the gates' records?
and this rivertrace land management
it gets paid directly from harrison's estate?
Yeah. A quarter mil a month.
there's a codicil added to harrison's will requiring the payments.
it was added a week before harrison died.
this doesn't look like any office of buckley's.
it's abandoned.
not exactly.
well, it looks like the only thing this place does is drain money from harrison's estate.
it's a rent receipt.
payment by wire transfer from a numbered account in the dutch antilles.
this is shell company 101.
I've seen this before. - What?
I've, um... Done this before.
broken into an empty office of a non-existent company?
no. Set up an empty office for a non-existent company.
my, um...My people, they, uh - They tend to outlive their identities, so...
every decade or so, we have to reinvent ourselves.
new name. New town. New birth certificate.
otherwise, you never age.
people become suspicious.
exactly.
and when one's garnered a certain amount of wealth, one prefers to retain it, and... So... Empty offices, shell companies, codicils to wills.
which raises a very uncomfortable question.
if we're trying to prove that buckley killed harrison...
what if harrison isn't dead?
and instead, he's funneling his own money to himself?
right.
what if harrison is like you?
we should meet.
Absolutely.
let's talk on the phone.
what's your number?
Devon, you left your bowl at my house when
Oh, sorry. You're busy. I'm gonna...
don't be silly.
let's sit. We'll have some tea.
I love this tea. I can't get enough of it.
that's because of the secret ingredient.
sorry if I ruined your party.
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous. I'm sorry.
you were the one that got thrown in the pool.
no, my party was doomed from the start.
I swear, devon, I'm never gonna understand this place.
it's the mysteries that make life interesting.
speaking of which...
any news on nick's little investigation into my pig of an ex-husband?
Yeah, you know I can't really talk about that.
Oh, but of course you can.
it's just the two of us.
you simply have to tell me everything.
Nick asked me to look at the gates' books and also harrison's will.
I found all sorts of strange things.
go on.
in harrison's will, the first thing I noticed was a clause added right before he died.
thanks for the tea.
forget all about it.
Hello, is this "beastlyboy"?
you have such a nice voice.
I can't wait to meet you.
no. Andie. Come on.
no, andie, wait.
I said go away!
you can't avoid me forever. - Brett, go away.
I don't want to talk to you. no!
leave her alone. - You don't know what you're doing.
I said back off.
stop it.
Brett, no.
stop!
you happy now?
Charlie. No. No.
I have to go.
how did I get so lucky?
someone like you with a mutt like me.
I picked you because you're not like the other boys.
you're different.
I don't know about that.
don't worry.
different" is exactly what I'm looking for.
you can show your true self to me.
I can't believe we're doing this.
Yeah, well, we're doing this.
don't we need a court order or something to exhume a body?
and a backhoe.
why I have you.
look, we need to know if harrison's dead or alive, right?
and the only way to do that... Is to dig.
so we dig.
all right, allow me.
fine.
check the right hip socket.
that hip was replaced.
Yeah, it's artificial.
it's harrison.
well, so much to my theory.
you know what?
turn his head over for a minute.
I want to check something.
you serious?
thought you'd be oka with dead things.
right there - You see that?
the impact wound on the skull.
that doesn't happen from falling down a flight of stairs.
this, my friend, is no accident.
anything you want to tell me?
I smelled you when you came in the door.
I smelled you.
I can explain.
I am working very hard to keep a promise that I made to you.
so whatever it is that you are doing... - I'm protecting our family.
buckley is blackmailing me.
that woman I killed to save nick, he got it all on video.
he saw you?
Yeah.
he showed the recording to me and nick.
well, what does he want?
money?
we have money.
he wants silence... Cooperation.
but listen, nick and I - We have a plan.
we're - we're getting the dirt on buckley, leverage
leverage?
Frank buckley... ...the man who welcomed us here with open arms, caught you murdering a woman inside the gates...
and all he's asking is that you follow the rules?
Claire... - And you want to fight him?
Dylan, I don't understand.
you're always the one who's saying,"think of us. Think of emily. Imagine the consequences.
you might want to heed your own advice.
try to put an end to this.
hurry up, slowpoke.
you'll miss the first bell.
that was sort of my goal.
a real shiner.
I told my mom I ran into a door.
I don't think she believed me.
you don't have to lie about what you did.
it was cool.
I got my ass kicked.
and that's not even the worst part.
I was trying to protect andie, but she acted like I did something wrong.
I don't get her.
look, I don't know what's going on with andie lately, but I know she cares about you.
so don't give up.
if you say so.
I definitely say so.
Hey, dylan, it's nick.
look, why don't you come down to my office?
Nick, I'm out.
what do you mean, you're "out"?
we agreed. - It's just too risky.
I think you're making a mistake.
or maybe he's the rational one and you're making the mistake.
I'll call you back.
this investigation of yours... It needs to stop.
you're trying to blackmail me and dylan.
what I'm doing isn't blackmail.
it's an intervention.
you both made serious missteps, and you need to know that you can't get away with that sort of thing here.
when are you gonna wake up and realize you have a good thing here?
and stop screwing it up.
is that what harrison was doing... Screwing it up?
Harrison? What are you talking about?
you talk about helping people, protecting what you built.
I think you murdered harrison.
I think you bludgeoned a feeble old man to death in his own home.
y - you think I killed harrison?
he was like a father to me.
everything I am today, I owe to him.
I could never have hurt him.
I know he was trying to close the gates.
he was angry.
he was confused, but... He was no threat to anyone.
even if I believe you didn't do it...
somebody murdered your friend, your mentor.
do you want to see justice?
of course I do.
I'm gonna have my people talk to my... - no.
no. Let me do my job.
normally, i'm not big on baths, c that's because you don't have to pretend with me.
you can just be who and what you are.
I've been looking for someone like you for a long, long time.
somehow I doubt you have trouble getting anything you put your mind to.
you'd be surprised.
my life has been a series of disappointments.
people have hurt me.
well, anyone that hurt you...you just point me in the right direction.
I know how to make problems go away.
you're sweet.
not very subtle, but sweet.
though, there is a way you can help me.
just tell me what to do.
more bubbles?
it's not so much what you can do.
it's... What you can give.
what I need from you are your eyes.
Dylan, are you home?
Hi, you know who this is. And you know what to do.
Christian, this has to stop - The phone calls, the flowers - Everything!
Karen. You can't come in here.
I don't need permission to enter a house, unlike some people.
what happened?
please leave.
why do we act like this with each other?
just go.
I can't.
it's sarah. She's in trouble.
she's been drinking devon's tea.
I think it's starting to have an effect.
what do you suggest we do?
first... I help you clean this up.
and then we talk to her.
gether.
Oh, guys, this is so nice.
I knew if you just spent some time together, you guys would get along.
sometimes it takes an outside point of view to spot the obvious.
it's good to have someone like you in the gates, sarah.
someone without the prejudice that the rest of us carry around.
still, um... We do have a confession to make.
this isn't entirely social.
Sarah, have long have you been drinking devon's tea?
well, uh, pretty much since I got here.
it's so relaxing. It's great.
it's like having two glasses of wine without the hangover.
and I imagine that it probably works better now than when she first gave it to you?
well, yeah. That's - That's true, but...
Sarah, what we're saying is...
things that seem too good to be true usually are, especially when they involve devon.
I can't go too deep into it, lloyd, but there were no signs of forced entry.
had to be someone harrison trusted.
like buckley.
exactly.
what I need from you is the why.
you put together all the finances and show how the payments from harrison's estate were funneled into rivertrace management.
I - I'll do everything I can.
good. Thank you, lloyd.
trust me, you help me solve harrison's murder - You're gonna be a hero.
Brett. Please.
no, listen to me for two minutes, and if you don't like what I have to say,
I swear I'll never speak to you again.
two minutes.
I finally understand you.
I know you think I don't, and at first, I had no clue.
but now... I get it.
Brett, I... - No, I get it, andie.
I get that everything going on with you is happening because you're different.
different in a way you think no one else could ever understand, but I do.
I understand.
I understand because I'm not human.
you're not alone, andie.
you never have to feel alone again.
it started with my mom.
right on cue, lloyd.
gotcha.
uh, I-I can explain.
it's you.
you're the one.
you changed harrison's will, and then you killed him.
it's been you all along.
d
never leave well enough alone.
I brought this to clear up some loose ends.
Freeze!
gun on the ground! On the ground!
get on your knees. Get on your knees.
hands behind your head against the desk.
you set me up.
I set you up?
facedown at the bottom of the stairs.
those crime-scene photos were never released.
you gave yourself away, you idiot.
you're welcome.
coming through.
no, wait.
wait.
give me a minute.
could've let me die. Then you would have been free of this place.
the thought crossed my mind.
go.
I won't try to stop you.
let's load him up.
I'm just - I'm just wrapping things up now.
uh, i'll call you back.
okay.
Mrs. Buckley. What can I do for you?
I just came from the hospital.
Frank asked me to stop by.
he says you're planning to leave the gates.
well, i'm thinking about it.
that's a shame.
Frank spent a long time looking for someone like you, someone who'd fit in here.
I think he found the right man.
this place isn't - isn't what I expected it to be.
you're afraid of the gates, of dylan and claire and the rest, because of one word - Vampires.
but sarah and claire, they're friends.
and dylan risked everything for u.
so what if they're not monsters?
what if they're just people with unique differences and difficult histories who need your help?
what if the gates isn't a trap?
what if it's a calling?
what if this is where you're meant to be?
okay.
if the gates is such a wonderful place to live, then why all the secrets?
what is frank trying to protect?
me.
he's protecting me.
I'm the reason frank fought harrison's plan to close the gates.
and the reason frank works so hard for our special residents.
because I'm one of them.
I'm a vampire.
the truth is, everything that frank has ever done for the gates, he's done out of love.
that's the real secret of this place.
love.
I really don't have a choice here.
Jack, I -- I don't know what to say.
uh, I'm sorry?
you know, I got to tell you...
worst date ever.
Oh, yeah.
is that my keyboard?
Dan, I'm pretty sure the taxpayers buy those computers. So you can solve crimes on them.
I'll tell you, it's a crime how much my back itches.
so, Jacko, what kind of punks are we busting today?
uh, the kind that throw rocks through house windows.
sounds promising.
Yeah, it sounds like vandalism.
Hey, listen, I got to get back to court. Thank you for helping me with these arrest reports.
and tomorrow, don't forget. Rangers/Yanks game. Don't be late. It's gonna be awesome.
I'll be there. First round's on me.
cool, man.
so, Jacquelyn, tell me something.
uh, after she took your manhood, where'd she put it
like, in a jar someplace?
are you implying that I am no longer a man because I'm going out with Liz and her friends?
Jack, she said goodbye and punched you in the arm. I mean, come on.
the only place a woman should punch a man is in the face.
okay. There's a story there, and I'm not asking what it is.
Jack, you don't do something with a girl you do with your friends.
it sends the wrong message.
and that message would be that I am also, in fact, - One of her friends? - Yeah, exactly. A "friend."
no longer a sexual threat.
not long before you're just another one of the girls.
so, watching baseball at a sports bar Makes me a girl?
exactly.
a scared, helpless little girl.
we found this rock on the floor.
so, did you know of anyone who would've wanted to do this?
ex-boyfriend? Those angry neighbors perhaps?
no idea.
okay, I want you young ladies to think hard.
first, it's just a small rock coming through the window.
then it's a bigger one.
next thing you know, find a guy hiding in your closet
with a camcorder and a bottle of scotch.
uh, j-just to be clear, ladies, That scenario seems highly unlikely here.
uh, w-when did this happen?
uh, about 11: 30 last night.
Sarah and I were in her bed watching a movie. And then there was a really loud crash.
you were both in bed, together?
I have to see exactly what was going on when this rock came flying through the window. Come on.
um, how is that supposed to help?
sometimes to crack a case, it's helpful
to see the crime from the victims' point of view.
would you describe it as snuggling, or was it more like spooning?
no, Detective, I already told you.
we were watching a movie. We're just roommates. - Yeah, of course you are.
we are.
no, uh-huh. I-I know.
we took your statement. That should be enough for now.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
no, no. We're gonna follow through with this.
Vanessa, I want you to go back with me, okay?
now, you and Sarah -- you're lying here.
you're watching your movie, whatever.
say Sarah needs some baby lotion.
reaches over you to get a little squirt right there, and...
Jack, get in here. Look.
not getting into a bed you're already in, Dan.
look! Out the window!
broken street lamps.
well, whoever broke those probably broke your window, too.
vanilla almond. That's nice.
wow, Dan, somehow, climbing into bed with the victim leads to some pretty solid police work.
who would want to break street lights?
someone who didn't want anyone to see what they were doing.
well, I'm aiming for 30 cars, but there's no guarantee I'll hit that mark.
now, the ship taking them overseas Leaves out of Baton Rouge in two days, so the cars have to be on a train out of Dallas tomorrow night.
if they're not, I'm in a real bind.
I can hardly take stolen cars through customs, now, can I?
right. Cheers.
here's your cash, guvernor.
straight to voicemail again.
I imagine she's just busy.
I really love this girl, you know, but she's driving me mad.
she never answers the phone, takes her sweet time returning my calls.
you don't think she's seeing someone else behind my back, do you?
with all due respect, sir, perhaps if you could learn to fully put your trust in someone else,
you'll find your relationships more fulfilling.
it's funny -- I didn't realize you had a second career as a bloody advice columnist!
and we're late. Where's my gun?
I trust you'll feel better once all these cars are on that train, eh?
I'm sorry, you guys. Our trains ain't running no more.
uh, we had a deal. You and your lot were supposed to put our cars
well, maybe you can appreciate my situation, then, all right?
my boss got pinched yesterday.
they found a bunch of coke in -- in one of our shipping containers... allegedly.
I wish there was something I could do.
I know this might be bad timing, but...
I was just wondering if maybe I can get my $20, 000.
I beg your pardon? - Well, now, you still have that warehouse
over there for storage, and I was the one who found it.
all I'm saying here, my U. K. Brothers,
it was not easy finding a place no one else knows about.
I did my job.
I should get my half of the cash.
so, what you're saying is, finding a place this remote and out of the way,
that was difficult for you.
unbelievably difficult.
look, I just figure I deserve something for my efforts.
Yes, you do.
take our friend, Bill to some other place that no one knows about
and she still hasn't called!
probably shagging some other bloke. I just know it.
Nigel, is it possible you're acting a tad bit...
jealous! You got to make Liz jealous.
first thing you got to do is you got to cancel this girls' night out.
Oh, uh, Detective, uh, Joyce, can -- can we just talk
Oh, guys, I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.
we can't provide you with the resources you requested.
you're the organized crime task force.
crime doesn't get any more organized than this.
more organized than kids throwing rocks through street lamps?
okay, look. Hear us out, okay?
now, we looked into the neighborhoods with, uh, broken street lamps,
and we noticed a crazy pattern
stolen vintage American cars in almost all of these neighborhoods.
I mean, White Rock, Shady Grove.
an established crew wouldn't go after old American cars. There's no market for them.
well, maybe not here, but we did some research,
and there's a huge demand for them In Europe and parts of China.
all we want is a bait car to see if we're on to something.
I wish I could help. I do.
thanks again for your report.
I'll make sure Lieutenant Orman takes another look in the next week or two.
week or two? Give me a day or two with a bait car,
I'll bust these auto banditos.
if, uh, anything else comes up on this, Detective Bailey,
feel free to call me directly.
holy mother.
did you sleep
Kristen was all, like, ooh, on your arm.
man, you got to get on that.
well, first off, it's "Kiersten."
and, second, she barely touched my arm.
it was more incidental, at least.
no, man, come on. That's incidental.
this is like, ooh. That's a sign. - Come on.
it's like,"Jack, I want to climb your beanstalk."
you think it's a sign when the checkout lady asks you for paper or plastic.
I know a sign when I see one. She's nibblin'.
you got to yank the rod, hook her, dude. Liz will go nuts.
okay, look, I'm more focused on the fact that the crime task force is using our report to line their trash cans, okay?
wait a minute. - Huh?
I got an idea. - What?
come with me. - Where we going?
well, you're the one who's saying that we always got to improvise, right?
hell yeah!
hell no!
it's American. It's vintage.
it's mine! - Well, we'll be careful.
we'll put a tracking device in it. We'll let them steal it.
and we'll trace the signal. We'll catch the bad guys.
it's a piece of cake.
how about I let them steal you?
or how about something you love? Your hair gel? Your mother?!
look, Dan, are you really gonna let the bad guys go because you're worried about your car?
come on!
I thought you were all about busting punks.
I have heard tell if you love something, set it free...
and then track it down.
okay, I'm in.
good!
okay, now all we got to do is get our hands on a tracking device.
from the department? After the task force shut us down?
not gonna happen.
I got an idea of where we could get one.
come on, y-you want to lock me in the trunk of your car till somebody steals it?
Julius -- No,"Julius," nothing, man.
I can't believe I came all the way out here for this.
I mean, you just said you needed one little favor.
we need the tracky thingy.
you know me -- if I could hack your leg off, I would.
come on, Stark. Give me one good reason why I'd ever consider doing this, man.
I'll give you one.
you aid us in this investigation, we'll get the tracking device removed.
you got a girlfriend in Jamaica, right?
bet you haven't seen her in a while.
you help us out, you can legally leave the country again.
y'all can do that, for real?
well, I'm sure the two of us can figure something out...off the books.
no doubt.
and where y'all gonna be exactly?
just right around there, out of sight, but we'll be keeping track of you with this.
see that blinking dot? That's you.
that's me right there?
you look good.
we got your back.
man, this is crazy, but all right.
okay. - All right.
Hey, you know what, I wanted you to have
just so you'd be comfortable.
here's some snacks...
some water.
Hey, if you start to lose consciousness, there's a release right there.
you'll want to know where that is.
okay. - Okay?
all right, look, man, y'all really
I'm claustrophobic, man. I don't like small spaces.
don't leave me in here that long. - Okay.
finally. Where the hell you been?
took forever.
sandwich shop. There was a line.
Oh, man, I'm starving.
has the little blinking light moved?
Uh...No.
Dan, what are you looking at?
playing with the computer machine, seeing if I could work it.
you know, they're -- they're handier than I thought.
you know, you really should not be looking at this sort of thing on a district computer.
it's the most natural thing in the world.
God. I was only gone for 30 minutes.
how many windows did you open up?
I don't know what that means.
Dan, it's been infected with a virus.
computers can't get sick.
Yes, they do, Dan. The computer's frozen.
well, which is it? Is it sick or is it cold?
it's broken.
Julius! - My car!
if those bastards put a scratch on my car...
or on the guy in the trunk.
we got to get some medicine for the computer machine!
fix that damn thing yet?
almost! Almost!
come on.
do they ever work?
they do when you don't break them, Dan.
okay, here they are. Here they are. They're -- they're three miles away.
just keep heading South on McKinney.
McKinney. Hang on, baby. Daddy's comin'!
daddy's comin'.
all right, on three.
get 'em up! Police! Police!
I should've never listened to y'all!
Hey, buddy. Sorry.
w-w-we had some technical difficulties, okay?
but, look, you know, we're
we're really glad to see that you're okay.
where the hell is my car?!
is he serious?
man, I-I've been in this stinking-ass trunk I don't know how long.
I-I'm listening to some scary-sounding English car thieves, and I'm thinking,"great."
I'm about to get killed, and it's not even an American that's gonna kill me.
what kind of English? Keith Richards English or Elton John English?
you know what, I didn't stick around long enough to have tea.
you don't know what I've been through.
I know that you're cold. I-I know that you're angry.
and y-you have every right to be, but right now...
we need you to take us to where they took Dan's car.
I want this damn thing off of my ankle tomorrow.
I will find you!
Yep. This is the place.
if you check that fence over there, you'll find pieces of my arm on it.
my baby's in that building. We got to roll.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Hold on. Hold on.
what?
what are you doing? What, are you writing a book?
who the hell you think you are -- Mariel Hemingway?
we got bad guys down there.
I'm taking down the license plate numbers on those cars,
give them to the organized crime task force.
come on! You mean, w-we're not gonna do this thing right here, right now?
no, not without a warrant, we're not, no.
we don't see your car, we don't know if those cars have been stolen.
and if Julius is right,
these guys sound like they're armed and dangerous.
well, it's simple.
we got a car carrier...
you need a car carrier.
so we want $400, 000 to move your cars to Baton Rouge.
anything less than that's gonna be considered an insult.
well, forgive me for insulting you, Mr. Mackey,
and I certainly do respect your position,
as illustrated by your shotgun,
but if you're still not inclined to renegotiate a more reasonable asking price...
may I offer an incentive? Alec.
I believe you mean this, sir.
well, I respect your position, too, but if you ain't inclined
to meet our more than reasonable asking price,
then maybe we could offer our own incentive to help you rethink your incentive system deal.
that's you, man.
I see.
won't be a moment.
Hello, darling.
I've been absolutely dying to hear from you.
well, working late is one thing, but you could at least pick up a phone and call back
what? Well, how on earth could
Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
I-I-I'm very, very glad that you called.
I'm very, very glad. Yes.
uh, you know I love you, right?
well, you, uh...
twisted my arm with your impressive negotiating skills.
we'll do it for $400, 000. Come on.
told ya!
you do know that you're only supposed to eat the part in the middle, right
you know, the peanutty part?
shell's the most nutritious part.
you know that the shell is like 80% cellulose?
that means that essentially you're eating tree bark.
salty, delicious tree bark.
enjoy.
well -- But -- Peanut shells are what they use to make drywall, Dan.
drywall.
I have good news, detectives. We ran those plates.
and every single one of those cars was stolen.
what the hell we waiting for? Let's go bust some punks!
we have to wait for lieutenant Orman to sign the warrant,
then the task force will lead the raid.
you're more than welcome to come and observe.
observe.
that's right, Detective Stark.
I hope that's not a problem.
no, I love a field trip.
by the way, how did you find this warehouse?
you didn't have a bait car, department resources.
we locked our snitch in my trunk.
that's a good one.
no, uh, we just followed some solid leads.
I mean, it was luck, really.
well, I'm glad you did.
gives us an excuse to work together, right?
right. Right.
okay. Bye.
Bye.
what is your freaking problem?
Kristen is offering herself up to you on a platter.
it's like this woman is in heat.
Dan, her name is Kiersten.
Hey, man, doesn't matter what her name is. You're never gonna see her naked.
I know I won't.
Jack, can I, um, ask you something? In private?
she asked you out? - Yeah.
so, are you embarrassed?
it's kind of the man's job.
actually, Dan, I'm kind of looking forward to it. Tonight should be a fantastic evening.
you're going out with her tonight?
Yeah. Why? Is that a problem?
no.
no, no.
no, it's fine. You -- you have fun.
why do I get the sneaking suspicion that I've somehow made you jealous?
we should be going out tonight! You don't celebrate a bust with your lady friend.
you celebrate it with your partner.
you do realize that we are not life partners.
you know what Frank and me used to do to celebrate a bust?
oysters and beer.
i-it was fascinating. You didn't know what was gonna make you puke first.
you try taking that kind of journey with Kristen.
it's Kiersten.
and I'd like to come up with plans that don't involve vomit.
what about the other thing I told you before?
or getting punched in the face, either.
...you all get out of there in one piece.
all right, gentlemen.
whatever hell on earth we find on the other side of that door...
let's remember one thing.
protect...
the gray Trans Am.
you think I'm kidding?
then let's roll.
go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
move it! Move it! Move it!
where the hell are they?
it's like they knew we were coming.
how's that possible?
won't be a moment.
Hello, darling.
I've been absolutely dying to hear from you.
Kiersten: Nigel, I'm still at work.
well, working late is one thing,
but you could at least pick up a phone and call back
they found your warehouse.
what? Well, how on earth could
it doesn't matter how.
you got to move your cars now, okay?
Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
I-I-I'm very, very glad that you called. I'm very glad that you called.
uh, you know I love you, right?
I love you, too, baby.
someone told them we were coming. Since Julius is a convicted criminal
who was trapped in a trunk,
he's the leading candidate, and we need to track him down - And ask him some questions. - Track him?
you know what, I already got his -- his tracky thingy.
it's right here. I pulled some strings.
pulled some strings? What are you
Yeah, you know Earl, his probation officer with the oily hair and the tooth?
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah.
I'll take care of it.
guys, we found your car.
you what?
that's -- that's real funny, Hodges.
Hey, your father called. He wants his seed back.
talk to me, baby.
tell me where you are.
I just don't understand why you insist on having dinner with this Jack chap.
because he and his partner are wild cards.
I denied their request for a bait car, but they found the warehouse anyway.
I want to know how they did it without going through the proper channels,
and they're not telling me the whole story.
are you doing this for me or because you fancy this chap?
Oh, my God, Nigel.
I-I thought you'd be happy about this.
you know, this jealousy thing is getting really out of hand.
Yes, you're -- you're right.
I'm sorry, darling.
could you make it a lunch instead of a dinner, though?
will that make you happy?
Yes.
pardon me, Nigel. Sorry.
when I'm finished with the cars, shall I give this place a little bit of a scrubbing, as well?
no, leave it.
no point in cleaning up one mess when we're making another one...
as soon as those wankers with the car carriers arrive.
I mean, we're letting other nations just rob us blind.
factories, plants, call centers, you name it.
you know who the number-one exporter is of American flags?
uh, America?
Yeah, you'd think so, right?
china.
korea's right there, too.
then in walks this fancy British feller
stealing all these vintage cars made here in the U. S. of A.
it just ain't right.
we should be the one with all them cars.
I don't know. We couldn't sell them here.
so we'd have to chop them up and find the buyers who want the parts.
it'd be a whole lot of work.
you're not listening to what I'm saying here.
what I'm saying is this
is that if anybody is gonna make money off of stolen American cars, it should be Americans.
made in America, stoled in America,
chopped in America.
not to mention we'd still be taking that $400, 000 U. S.
what do you say about that?
I think it sounds like the patriotic thing to do.
I'm starving. - You want to go jam a burrito?
I would, but I actually just got a text from, uh, Kiersten.
she forgot that she's got dinner plans tonight,
so she asked if, uh, you know, we could have lunch.
today? You're having your date now?
actually, you want you know what, I-I-I should cancel 'cause, I mean, we're busy.
we got to go find Julius.
no, no, no, no, no, no. I-I-I can handle Julius.
I think you should
you should go on your date, Jack.
you got a date, Jack?
uh, well, no, I mean, it's really just a lunch, really.
it's with, uh, Kristen, that smoking-hot chick from the task force.
she is in heat for Jack. Mating season.
wait, you mean Kiersten? - Kristen, yeah.
Kiersten, the -- Wow. She's...beautiful.
Jack, you should really... get on that.
uh, good job. I'm
I'm real happy for you.
I'm say -- what?
you're doing something with your mouth. Are
what? - It's like -- are
are you jealous?
don't be ridiculous. I'm not jealous.
you're looking pretty jealous, Liz.
I'm not jealous!
Oh, my...
listen to this advice.
put on that cute smile that you do that all the girls love, and, uh, be yourself,
and if she's got half a brain in her pretty head,
she will take her lunch to go and rip off all your clothes,
and I will not be one bit jealous.
Amen.
okay.
thanks for the tip, Liz.
I'm so glad we had this talk. Come on, bring it in. Bring it in.
come on. Group hug. I'm sitting -- No.
I'll sit this one out. - Okay.
more Jacko for me. Come here. Give it to me.
okay. Okay.
you want to know what? You just lifted my car keys.
Yeah, I did.
I'll drop you at your flesh wrestle.
I just got to go pick up Julius. I don't have a car.
no. Absolutely not.
look, fool me once, fool me twice, however many times
man, I am not getting back in another damn trunk of another damn car.
look, j-bone, calm down. - What?!
I know you were traumatized yesterday.
I just think if we re-create the situation,
it may jar loose some memories
where they're going, what they're doing, anything.
no. No.
come on, my brother.
I thought we had a deal. I thought we were gonna help each other.
man, we did help each other out. - No, I helped you.
did I get that tracky thingy off your ankle? Yes, I did.
did we bust some car-thief punks
and get back my bad-ass ride? No, we did not.
sounds to me like a "quid pro no quo." I want my quo.
alright. Fine.
I'll re-create the situation of getting in your damn trunk.
you said these characters were English.
could you translate anything they were saying?
they were speaking English, Dan.
I know they speak English. I just can't understand
a damn thing they say unless they're singing.
were they singing?
no, man, they wasn't singing. They was, like
they was talking about trains and shipping cars
and oversea buyers, man.
one dude kept yapping about his girlfriend.
did you get any names?
dude with the girlfriend's name was, uh, Niles.
and I think the girl's name was, uh, Kristen.
Kristen? - Yeah. Man, what does this help?
man, what, you gonna put an A.P.B. out for all the Kristens in Dallas?
that's the name of the smoking-hot chick on the task force.
that's it!
that's how they knew we were coming.
Jack! No, no! Let me -- yo!
Oh, I'm -- geez! - Let me ride with you!
that's a terrible idea, Nigel.
if I bring Jack to you, my cover will be blown.
not if we kill him.
Nigel, baby, you would never want to kill a cop
if you didn't have some delusional idea that there was something going on between him and I.
is there something going on between the two of you? - No.
well, then, it shouldn't be a problem. See you soon.
I, uh, hope you like calamari.
I ordered it as an appetizer.
actually, um, I know this might sound crazy,
but, uh, do you want to get out of here?
uh, yeah, sure. Any place you had in mind?
how far away do you live?
uh, well, not far. Not far.
there's something you need to know about Kristen!
okay, Jack! Holster that weapon! I'm coming in!
holy...
22
okay. Here we are.
home. My home. Uh, let's see,
you'll probably be wanting a grand tour, yeah?
let's just start with the couch.
okay. Yes, we can do that.
the couch is, uh
okay, well, uh, the couch is in the living room.
Yeah.
Liz was right.
what?
uh, nothing, nothing. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
couch.
good couch.
Oh, oh, hey, uh, watch -- watch my weapon.
okay.
okay, we should go to another room.
Kiersten, what are you...
sorry about the mixed signals, but...
I need you to meet my boyfriend.
you have a boyfriend?
Yeah. His name is Nigel.
I think you two are gonna not hit it off.
the car thieves. You told them we were coming.
now, normally I don't bring out the handcuffs, this early in the relationship,
but, uh, well, you understand.
put these on, Jack.
nice and slow.
okay. Okay.
you got me, Jack.
sorry, Jack.
you and I are gonna go for a ride.
if the idea is to keep them from coming after us,
what's the difference between killing them and just shooting them in the legs?
because in that scenario,
the British guys don't end up dead.
what, you think our founding fathers won by aiming for the legs?
I just
I ain't ever killed anyone before.
what if I can't?
it's simple, man. You just shoot them in the back of the head.
do you realize in about 2015,
there's gonna be more Mexican restaurants in this country
than there are American restaurants?
I like tacos.
so do I, but that ain't the point.
we're fighting for our country here, man.
what if they're looking at me?
do I shoot them in the front of the head?
the front of the head is also called the face.
and, yeah, the front of the head is a kill shot, too. Come on.
Jack: Are you crazy? You're kidnapping a police officer.
Whoo! Knock yourself out, cowboy.
but let me warn you -- after you break those handcuffs,
you're gonna need to chew your way through the door.
so you probably want to hurry it up.
you're making a big mistake.
Jack's in trouble.
Kristen is a dirty cop... And not in a good way.
it's just you and me.
no, it's not, man -- look, I have already done more than enough for you, okay?
just call for backup, and then you drive my ass home.
I got no one else I can trust.
it's -- it's you and me, my brother.
come on, we got
we got to prove that this Kristen Chick is a mole.
and can you please stop saying "we"? Please.
man: Detectives Stark and Bailey.
stark and Bailey. What's your 20?
detective Stark here.
detective Stark, are you aware that your C. I. Julius Grant's
ankle tracking device was deactivated and then reactivated?
wait, you're -- reactivated?
why was it deactivated?
I don't know. Crime. I -- I got to go.
why the hell is your ankle tracky thingy beeping all of a sudden?
11
knock yourself out, cowboy.
but let me warn you -- after you break those handcuffs,
you're gonna need to chew your way through the door.
so you probably want to hurry it up.
you're making a big mistake.
quit.
the beeping -- the beeping has got to be Jack.
Hello, handsome. - Took you long enough, didn't it?
it's always lovely to meet another member of Dallas' finest.
pity we missed each other when you raided my warehouse.
you know, you caused me quite a headache.
do you realize how difficult it was to find this dump at such short
not to mention the fact that it's making my cars absolutely filthy.
okay, well, okay, look, look. You don't want to do this.
you don't want to kill a police officer.
people I work with, the entire department,
they're gonna be looking for you.
I'm afraid you're wrong about that, mate.
Ah, well, I'm really wishing I didn't take you back to my place. Ha!
you went back to his place?
it was the only way I could get his gun off of him.
that wasn't part of the plan.
Oh, you're a really lucky man.
you know, she's very good at her job.
did you sleep with him?! - No, of course not!
she's slept with half the Dallas police department.
I mean, everybody knows about her.
let me guess -- she's always "working late"?
shut the hell up. That's not true.
is that why you never answer your cellphone?
no, I never answer my phone because I'm working at my job
as a police officer.
okay, hey, you want to know what? Believe what you want.
okay? But she is a fantastic liar.
I mean, she fooled me.
shut the hell up, Jack! Nigel, baby...
do you know how much I've sacrificed to be with you?
I would never be unfaithful.
why don't I believe you?
because you're insanely jealous.
let's just kill them both, Alec.
Alec: Sorry about this, Kiersten. It'd be easier if you don't put up a fight.
Nigel, this is ridiculous!
Nigel: As ridiculous as you shagging half the cops in the city?
any more tricks up your sleeve?
I sure hope so.
why won't this damn thing work?
come on, you stupid bastard.
is it go time? Is it go time? Huh?
Oh. This is crazy.
uh, I'll quit my job. We'll spend more time together.
Yeah, you should definitely quit your job.
no, Kiersten. This has been festering in our relationship for quite a while now.
you know, sometimes the only thing to do
is to just get it all out in the open.
Nigel, I wonder if maybe you're being a bit rash.
sorry to interrupt!
who the hell are these guys?
I think they're supposed to be the drivers.
but I believe you got $400, 000 for us.
and there's been a change of plans.
it's another sort of border patrol.
ain't none of these American cars leaving America.
you think you're smarter than me?! Huh?! Do you?!
do you?! - Hey, Dan. Dan!
come on! Come on!
come on. I got to get packed.
come on! Yeah! I got it!
tell me where my partner is!
get that gun.
I do believe...
this is what you call an incentive.
I suppose you'll be wanting the keys.
go on, Nigel.
come on, Dan. What's taking so long?
stupid!
Mind-freak robot!
it's like you're thinking my thoughts!
it's like you're in my head! I can't take it!
you're freaking me out! - Hey, whoa, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
okay? I'm freaking out!
can I -- let me just -- can I do this? - I'm freaking out!
let me just try -- - Freaking out!
okay. Hey. Hey!
you got it going? - Yes. All right.
nice. - W, it's just
okay, it's a simple tracking program, all right?
you follow the -- the coordinates.
good work, Julius.
wow, it's like you're the computer-machine whisperer.
well, uh, let's roll.
tell me where my partner is.
that's not gonna work. Okay, listen. Just
tell me where! - Give it here.
all right, look, go 30 East to Westmoreland.
for the last time, I don't have your $400, 000!
I had no intention of following through
on that ludicrous deal that we made.
I was gonna kill you and steal your car carrier.
I knew I couldn't trust you the second I heard that funny accent.
Oh, don't get all high and mighty.
you're the one who's standing there with a shotgun
about to kill me and steal the cars I stole.
give me whatever money you got on you. Let's go.
it's a little tricky, isn't it?
because you shot the guy who handles my accounts.
who the hell are they? - She was my
actually they're both Dallas police officers.
you got to be kidding me, man!
let's talk. You know, figure something out.
you can kill the others, but if you let me live,
you'll have a cop working for you on the inside
a cop no one else knows about.
listen, sister...
there is no one here that appreciates what you do for the country more than I do.
but I cannot risk letting you walk out of here alive.
please. You don't have to do this.
I don't really have a choice here.
Jack, I don't know what to say. Uh, I'm sorry?
you know, I got to tell you...
worst date ever.
is that my car?
1
...a cop no one else knows about.
Hey, hey, you got an extra gun?
no, no. You've done enough.
time for you to get out of here. - No, wait, wait.
you go have fun in Jamaica.
wait, you can't do this alone, man.
you -- you're gonna get your ass shot off, Dan.
we need a distraction.
I think I finally figured out how to use a computer machine.
is that my car?
Freeze! Police!
you remember what I said about them British fellers?
you mean about aiming for the head?
Yep. That applies in this case, too.
Hey, your girlfriend's making a run for it!
not my girlfriend!
that's a shame. That's a true American classic.
how could you do this?
I really thought we have something.
Kristen, love. We can work this out.
my name's Kiersten.
this one's out of bullets.
that means it's time for us to go.
come on. Come on.
my baby!
handcuffs, huh? - Yeah, and she punched me in the face!
my kind of woman!
you don't mess with a man's ride.
son of a bitch!
no offense, Jack, but you're not getting a good-night kiss.
Freeze! Police!
well, I-I mean, he's -- he's the police. I'm just helping out.
we did it, partner.
the Trans Am is safe.
Yeah, me too.
I just shot him in the leg. I don't want to go to jail.
you make me sick.
Jack Bailey, that has to qualify
as the worst first date in the history of first dates.
Yeah, you're right about that.
boy, you got here in a hurry.
that's what people do when their friends are kidnapped.
by a girl.
it doesn't make any difference to me that she's a girl.
but, no, you know what does make a difference to me?
she was a hot girl.
detective Stark,
can I have five minutes alone with Jack Bailey, please?
you all right? - Yeah.
I'm glad you're okay.
Thanks, Liz.
and I have a small confession to make.
I was maybe, earlier,
just marginally jealous.
you were? Huh. - I was.
I guess I saw something in your eyes I haven't seen since us.
well, you, uh, you did say some awfully nice things about me.
Yeah, well, don't let it go to your head. - Okay.
Hey, listen, I was thinking it's not too late
to catch a few innings of that rangers game.
if you want to, I could grab us some seats up or something.
I don't know. What do you think?
Yeah, uh, you know, I mean, that's a tempting offer,
but Dan and I, we sort of have a tradition after a big bust.
Oh. Okay. - Maybe some other time.
no. Okay.
so...
oysters and beer?
until we puke.
det. Jack Bailey's apartment 9: 14 PM
CODE11 IN PROGRESS 14 HOURS EARLIER
what the hell? Fantastic!
come on, now. What the hell?
new desks! No more thigh gouging!
wait, wait. Let me check.
no more thigh gouging! - Okay. That's it.
I kept my mouth shut when they painted the walls.
I kept my mouth shut when they put up those emaciated, little, new techno monitors.
I even kept my mouth shut - When they took the urinals out of the men's room! - That was the ladies' room.
okay, fine. My bad.
point is - this may just be "furniture" to you, but I loved that desk.
I made love on that desk.
and they replace it with this blondine, Swedish, European-ass, allen-wrench-loving crap.
I mean, I'm all for change, but it's too much!
Wow. New mugs.
I take it all back.
it's solid. I like it.
got a nice heft to it.
it's a hell of a mug, Dan.
Oh, my god.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Did I... Burn you?
no, no. I think you missed.
are you sure?
sometimes tissue damage doesn't show up right away.
she's right, Jack. You should check.
you lose a testicle, it will not grow back.
trust me. Am I wrong?
no. I'm - I'm fine.
I'm sorry. I don't believe we've met.
detective Jack Bailey.
right. Sorry. Uh, Samantha.
I just started with the CSI Division. - Detective Dan Stark.
Hi. - Hi.
did you do your field training here in dallas?
actually, I'm just a lab assistant. For now.
I want to be a field tech.
I love being in the field.
ever since I was a kid,
I just loved playing in the field.
I'd dig around and find dead mice and birds, and now I get to do the same thing!
what the hell are you doing here?
suddenly too old to call me uncle Nate
I haven't seen you in 15 years.
it's not exactly "suddenly."
what are you doing in my apartment?
you sound angry, Jack.
are you still upset about the thing with the dog?
I'm upset with the fact that you've broken into my apartment in the middle of the night.
there's a good reason for that.
I believe I may have witnessed a crime.
one day earlier code 18 in progress
okay. Then you should have gone to the precinct and filed a report.
well, present company excepted,
I don't always have the best rapport with law enforcement.
I thought it'd be better to come to you because, well, I may or may not have an outstanding warrant for my arrest right now.
is that so?
Yeah. It's a total misunderstanding.
I was selling insurance in Arlington.
it was going great.
it's a real moneymaker, by the way.
but let me guess - Somebody filed a claim?
the guys who set me up with the account said it was all on the up-and-up and that everything was official until suddenly they disappeared.
well, Nate, I guess it is hard to teach an old dog new tricks.
you see? You're still upset about the thing with the dog.
I'm upset because you committed insurance fraud.
you broke the law.
come on.
and since I am a cop, I have to arrest you.
you're gonna arrest me, Jack? I'm your uncle!
okay. Then I will turn a blind eye to the breaking and entering, and we'll call it a family discount.
get up and turn around. - Are you serious?
you're gonna march me on down to the station now at this hour? come on. It's late.
you actually threw him in jail?
there was a warrant out for his arrest.
Jack, he's your uncle.
the guy is a crook. He always has been.
look, when I was a kid, he got my dad to invest in a "can't miss" business opportunity.
and it missed. - Yeah, big-time.
okay. All right, my parents lost everything.
we had to sell our house, we moved into an apartment complex that didn't accept dogs.
it was a mess. - I understand. I hear you. I do.
but I got to tell you, as your friend,
I don't think you should let the personal feelings you have about your uncle get in the way of cracking potentially a huge case.
you mean that so-called crime? It's probably a con, too.- But what if it's not?
all I'm saying is,
I don't want to bust him on some petty insurance fraud when we could be looking at a major arson case.
you're bored, Jack!
you said you were bored.
you want to get un-bored or not?
I hate you.
I asked her, " who gave you the 50 cents? "
she says, "they all did. "
what?
what are you doing?
you didn't tell me you had an uncle, man.
can I speak with you in private for a second?
Oh, yeah. Lord, he's funny, man.
W - what are you doing, talking to him for?
the guy's bad news.
Aw, come on, Jack.
what, is this about the dog?
he told me about that.
you got to let it go, bro.
he feels awful about it to this day, just awful.
I'm sure that he does.
listen, uh, the D. A. wants us to interrogate him to see if there's anything to this "crime" that he witnessed, all right?
right, let's hang out. You want to do it here, or should we all go out and get some lunch?
we'll do it here.
but I got us a table.
I was having a drink the other night, this bar in uptown, next to this guy
big mouth, big talker, big biceps, no stranger to the bench press.
you know? Kind of like these guns.
he's classic.
I love it.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.
I overheard him talking about a fire, arranging a fire.
now, I did not hear everything, but he mentioned cedar hill lane.
and, of course, I'm gonna remember that because
you used to take me to the batting cages at cedar hill lane.
Yeah. - Damn.
Touchin'.
anyway, next day, I read in the paper, police log
a house burnt down on cedar hill lane.
Yeah, I read that, too.
I knew I had to tell somebody about it.
you're a detective, and I was looking for an excuse to see you.
well, if - if it was arson, and more importantly, if we can prove it, I'd say this was a pretty good lead.
of course it is. You gonna tell him...Or am I? I can't stand it.
no. Maybe you should tell him. - Tell me what?
uncle Nate got you a dog. Really?
he got you a dog! Show him the picture!
his name is Keaton.
now, he barks a little bit, he's kind of an ankle-nipper, but he is a really sweet boy.
what? - Got you a dog.
what? No. no. I don't want a do
I don't even want a picture of a dog. No.
the problem is, if you don't go to pick him up, they're gonna put him down.
go ahead.
you're not gonna let Keaton die, are you?
look at the face on this guy.
I think he got skin that time.
you know, you're lucky you got a dog that does that.
Ankle-biting's one of nature's best defense mechanisms.
now, you disable a man's ankles, that dude goes down.
Yeah, well, I'll remember that next time we're chasing after an evil mailman, Dan.
here's the torched house.
is that... Samantha?
Hi, detectives! - Hey, baby.
what are you doing here?
I was going through the case file this morning.
the one on my desk? - Yeah.
and once I saw the word "arson," I freaked.
I love arson
how it just consumes and destroys everything in its path.
what is your dog's name?
that's Izzy. That's Keaton.
I love this girl.
look, it's - it's great that you're - you're interested, but we're still not 100% sure this is arson.
Yeah, we are. Look.
it's broken glass. The heat probably shattered it.
well, I mean, the edges are curved.
that indicates someone broke the window, probably to get in, and then set the fire.
if it shattered from the heat, the edges would be straight.
Oh, and I found a char pattern in an accelerant
most likely to be gasoline.
I mean, I'd have to do some gas chromatography to know for sure.
so, um, what now?
we're still investigating...out here in the field.
so we'll probably talk to, uh, some neighbors.
Yeah, if we can find any.
this place is a freakin' ghost town.
Yeah. Which is weird.
I was reading the housing report.
it said that this neighborhood had the highest amount of real-estate activity in Dallas-fort worth for the past year.
well, where's the moving vans?
Where's the welcome wagons?
Where's the sound of lawn mowers, weed whackers, and whatnot?
someone lives in a house down the street.
I saw the lights on earlier, and, uh, this woman was just driving out - Oh.
would you remember what she looks like?
Yeah, she was like 40-ish, blond, pretty.
she was holding a shotgun.
blond? - Shotgun?
okay, we'll start there.
uh, do you mind watching these dogs? Yeah, yeah.
keep your eye out for this one. He's an ankle-biter.
something's not right.
I mean, look at this neighborhood.
you got nice houses, great location.
and yet the entire block's deserted?
Hey, somebody's living in there.
the TV's on.
a mysterious lady with a shotgun.
Yeah, who knows? Maybe she's just a crappy neighbor.
you know, Frank used to live next to this dude who raised ferrets.
you know that ferrets have more glands - Look at this.
might be the lone resident of this neighborhood.
is it just a perspective thing, or is she gaining speed?
she probably just doesn't see us. Police!
stop!
she ain't gonna stop. - Stop!
I said stay away from my house, and I mean it!
won't you be my neighbor?
calm down, ma'am. - Easy.
calm down, all right?
we're - we're police officers. We're cops.- Oh, yeah? Let me see your I.D. then.
I must have dropped it when you were trying to run me over.
Yeah, let me see your I.D. - I don't have my badge!
I- I left it in the cleavage
uh, in the car - I don't have it!
easy! - I am so tired of you people trying to run me out of here.
I'm over it, and now I'm pushing back.
we are cops! I swear!
what you are is leavin' - now!
okay, okay. One second. One second.
Dan, Dan, find my badge.
what's it look like? - I dropped it down "what does it look like?"it looks like a badge!
here it is!
right there.
protect and serve.
Hey, now.
Oh, no, thank you.
I thought you were here to kill me.
now, why in hell would we want to harm a beautiful, fit woman like yourself?
because someone's been forcing out all my neighbors.
I'm the last one left.
they slashed my tires, they cut my phone line, and last week...
somebody killed my cat.
come on. - Did you call the police?
Yeah, I called the police.
they sent a patrol car, but whoever's doing this just waited till they left.
Yeah, well, that's cops for you.
ms. Mcallister, do you have any idea who might be behind this?
any enemies? Ex-boyfriends, perhaps?
current boyfriends? Husbands?
I'm not married.
but about six months back,
I got a call, someone asking to see if I would be willing to sell the house.
I didn't know who they were, but they called again.
and what did you say?
I said "no."
I know they're pushing everybody else out on this street, but this is my home, and I am not gonna be forced ou not without a fight.
Amen, sister.
well, whoever's behind this certainly has a lot of money if they're offering to buy your house.
Oh, yeah.
someone wants this land bad.
we break ground on the development next month, yet there's one homeowner left.
so, we were just wondering...
when you expect her to be gone.
you know my reputation.
you know that if somebody needs a job done, they call me - Kenny Griffin.
Rome wasn't built in a day, gentlemen.
and the people who lived in the place where rome was built weren't cleared out in a day.
see, these methods do work.
that bitch will vacate.
that land will be yours.
now...
any questions?
ms. Mcallister, we'll be sure to get a patrol out here right away.
well, thank you, detective.
I'm deeply sorry for your suffering.
and I promise you, I give you my word,
I will solve this heinous crime, and I will protect your person...
personally.
you're gonna be my bodyguard?
Oh, yeah.
I'm gonna stay real close.
I'm gonna protect you...
and I'm gonna protect you again...
then I'm gonna protect you again.
I'm gonna protect your socks off, as much as you can take it.
I can take it. - You can take it.
okay!
well, if that isn't a hallmark card,
I don't know what is.
Dan, can we go now?
what?
the glass, I found inside the kitchen.
that's where they broke in.
and the gasoline residue
that was pretty much everywhere.
and this...
Oh. Tuna.
d - do you want some.
no? No.
well, that proves it was arson.
I mean, not the tuna, but this stuff.
I'm so sorry, Sam.
this is excellent forensics work, but you're not authorized.
not being part of the department, a judge is just gonna rule it inadmissible.
Yes, her findings are inadmissible, but surely it's enough to stretch it to probable cause?
and since when do you care so much - About helping your uncle, Jack? - I don't.
but a crime was committed, and Dan and I need to investigate it.
where is your partner, by the way?
I got a pretty good idea.
come here, you!
I haven't protected you in the living room yet.
Ohh. I did not need to hear that.
all right! Police! Freeze!
now, turn around nice and slow!
no, wait!
you want it? Catch.
everybody good?
everybody safe?
I'd feel a lot safer if you closed your robe.
so, somebody gave him 50 bucks and a bottle of schnapps to light that house on fire.
what are we supposed to do with that?
well, don't worry about him. He's a dead end.
take a look at this.
I was looking at the county real-estate records.
all the houses were sold to a single corporation.
Kettleman holdings.
who's kettleman?
I have no idea. I - Nate: right?
Oh, hey! You know, I forgot.
Meredith - Ms. Mcallister
she saw something that I think might be "revelant."
relevant? - I think it is.
she saw a bunch of guys in a car the night they lit that house on fire.
first guy - black, 35 to 40, cool hair.
second guy - white, 60s, kind face, tall.
guy number one kept calling guy number two Ned or Newt...
right? Am I right?
...or Nate?
no. "Nate."
son of a bitch.
Oh, no.
Hey! You're in on this, aren't you?
and do not even think for a second of lying to me.
okay.
I first met Kenny Griffin a year ago through some mutual - Well, let's call them "friends."
no, let's call them "accessories to the crime."
that's probably more accurate.
anyway, Kenny wanted some help - Meeting some potential new clients. - What kind of clients?
Kenny has an unusual line of work.
say you want to buy a property, you want to put up condos or a mall, there's people living there, you want them to move
Kenny makes that happen.
and so he - he what?
he goes in and he beats the hell out of people?
no, no, no, no. He uses fire.
wait. So you find clients for a psycho who tortures and terrorizes people
Jack, I had no idea what I was getting myself into.
I thought I was just gonna introduce him to influential businessmen.
I had no idea he was gonna burn people's houses down.
you worked for him for a year.
you don't know this guy. Once you're in, you can't just say, "oh, I quit."
he'd burn my face off.
you broke in to my house, and you lied to me! - Jack, okay.
you would have never listened to me if you knew I was connected.
hell, you don't trust me as it is.
you know, forcing people out of their homes is a federal offense.
if Kenny is involved...
thinking "sting."
well, Nate is the perfect way in.
he has direct access to Kenny. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm thinking code names, disguises, elaborate back stories.
it's sneaky. I like it. I like it.
the two of you are thinking about putting him at the center of a sting operation?
Jack, he's our only way to the bad guy.
he's a con man, and I'm an idiot for even letting him back in my life.
no. I won't be part of this, because this is not a good plan.
this is a very, very...Bad dog! Bad dog!
get off the couch!
Oh. Hi. - Hi.
you want to talk about it?
not particularly.
do you want to drink about it?
come in.
all right! What'd I tell you?
hot tubs, cold beer.
how you doing, there, darlin'?
what more could a man want?
one of those to go.
Barkeep! Where you at, my brother?
detective Dan Stark.
good to see you out of the pawn-shop business and into something more legit.
give me a bump! Come on, now! - I'm not...I'm not bumping you.
we are not bumping buddies.
don't make me look bad in front of my friend.
give me a bump, my brother!
okay, I will give you a bump, but you have to promise to never call me your brother again, okay?
it's an insult to my actual brother.
Yeah, we go way back. Mm-hmm.
Oh, my!
let's talk about Kenny Griffin.
and your uncle Nate
it's so perfect the way that he fits in there and he could help us in his position.
but it can't work. You're right.
we need to find another way to do that.
get in.
and we will...
eventually.
you're working me.
hmm?
you're trying to get me to agree to use Nate in this sting operation.
your personal feelings about your uncle are getting in the way of you doing your job properly.
that man ruined my family. - No.
he told your parents about an investment scheme, like, a billion years ago, and they agreed to it.
so maybe you need to get over it.
Sniffter.
that was the name of my dog - Sniffter.
I loved that dog.
he slept with me in my bed every night.
he walked me to school.
and not once did he bite me on my ankles.
and when we moved out of that house, we had to give sniffter away to some family that lived out on a farm somewhere.
the entire ride out, my parents were telling me, "oh, he's going to a better place."
and I just cried and cried and cried.
that's so sad, Jack.
a month later, we found out that the dog died.
a cow... Fell on him.
...have a little heart.
I loved that dog!
you know what? That's it. No.
I'm gonna go get more alcohol.
I don't want to tell you how to do your job, detective, but I'm afraid, if we don't get jack involved, we're not gonna be able to catch Kenny Griffin!
Kenny "lit his own eyebrows on fire," Kenny Griffin?
you know this guy?
I mean, I-I know of him.
and listen - You are not allowed to speak that name in my bar ever again.
I'm not allowed to say the name "Kenny Griffin"?
don't say that name again, okay?
or our fists will never bump again.
I will leave you, Dan Stark, and I'm serious, okay?
I will cut you off. This is not a laughing matter.
okay. I hear you.
so, what do you know about this, uh...
this... Fella?
a couple years ago, okay, this psycho, whose name I will not mention, he burned down my cousin's garage twice.
he literally came back, like, after the fire department put out the fire.
he set fire to the burned building.
all right?
he double-burned it.
brother scares the hell out of me.
we need to take this guy down, Dan.
not without Jack. No, sir.
I do not go behind my partner's back.
I mean, that's one thing I will not do.
maybe this time, you need to make an exception.
this guy needs to be stopped before he kills somebody.
I don't know about you, but I think that's more important than some silly bailey family issues.
Yeah. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. You're right.
I mean, I-I-you know, I feel bad about flying solo, but I feel even more bad - About letting a man like Kenny Griffin just - Unh unh.
Kenny. - no.
Mr...Mr. Griffin! - That's it. We are done.
uncle Nate, looks like it's up to you and me.
what do you say? You ready?
ready when you are. Okay.
let's take down Kenny Griffin.
it feels more funeral director than land developer.
no, no. It looks good.
lose the handkerchief, though.
you like a magician. - Dan?
Hey! Hey, Jacko! - How you doin'?
are you - Are you going on the sting?
Yes. Without me?
Yes, we are.
we got to stop Kenny.
now we have a way to him - Nate.
let me guess - This was Nate's idea?
it was my idea.
I am completely in control.
I got a back story and everything.
what is it? - My name is Trent Cummings.
I am a building developer, looking to develop some buildings.
I have some squatters I need to vacate.
is - is that it?- No.
I make crafts from the rattlesnakes that I find here and there about my ranch.
I enjoy hunting.
I own a catamaran.
I once met Chuck Norris in line to get some gelato.
he was gracious and fancies a waffle cone.
Oh. Okay.
great. For a while,
I - I was worried that you wouldn't be believable...
and that Kenny would kill both of you.
nobody's gonna get killed.
he's right. Kenny's not a details man.
he just wants the deal done.
man!
that is a sweet ride, Nate.
When'd you get this car? - Here's the $10, 000
okay. What?!
we're - we're - We're giving him a car?
you're - You're getting 10 grand?
what the hell is going on here, Dan? - He's a wealthy land developer.
he can't drive around in a Transam.
look, I got the money.
you know, everything's under control.
e - everything's fine. Let me tell you something, Jack.
I looked into your uncle's eyes...
saw his soul.
now, we urinated together, side by side.
got a good stream. I trust him.
okay. I'm coming with you guys.
and I'm keeping my eyes on you, and I'm keeping my eyes on that money.
okay, Jacko. You keep the eyes.
so, Nate tells me you're looking to put up some buildings.
that's right - Big buildings.
texas-sized buildings!
all units, maintain your positions.
Mr. Cummings has made an offer on a property not far from here, but the current tenant doesn't want to sell.
Yeah, we can't get the guy to leave.
you can't get a man off his property legally, so I was hoping that you could, uh
Oh, I don't know...
blow the place up?
"blow the place up"?
what kind of monster do you think I am?
well, I thought you were the kind of guy who got people, uh, to leave.
okay, guys, he's got to take the money.
so what do you say? Let's do this!
do it now. Let's deal.
take that cash.
you're like a fat kid on his birthday.
you just want to get straight to the cake, huh?
waddle, waddle, waddle. I love that cake!
who doesn't love cake?
everybody. You know, I once had gelato with Chuck Norris.
interesting.
see, here's the thing
my business is all about persuasion.
guys, this doesn't work if he doesn't take the money.
you have to start out subtle, but direct.
I say we pay the man a little visit.
a visit? - Yeah.
see if we can make this happen without, uh, "blowing up the place."
why use a flamethrower when all you need is a match?
you know what I'm saying?
you know what I'm saying.
so, where is this place?
just say something. -- All right? Make something up.
it's the tempo - Tempo lounge.
the guy's name? - Julius. Julius Grant.
grant, it is.
Julius? Why did you get Julius involved?
Why? Is that - is that bad? Did I mess up?
Oh, dang. I messed up. - Where is he? Where is he?
where is who - Julius? No. Nate he's got the money.
he's got the money! - All units, we have a stolen gray sedan headed south on pacific!
driver is Nathan Bailey, a white male, 6'4"!
Freeze! Get out of the car! Right now!
it looks like those ankle bites caught up with you, there, hopalong.
that old lady didn't bite you in the ankle, too, did she?
ha ha ha. Very funny.
so I distrust people, and my ankle is shredded.
that's hilarious.
here's the cash.
you can count it if you like.
I'll count it.
what were you thinking?
giving him Julius' name? Kenny's gonna kill him. - He'll be all right.
we just got to convince Julius to go along.
No! Absolutely not!
Julius, you have to help us out here.
okay, now, Griffin is gonna walk through that door any second.
I'm not doing this. All right?
I choose life. All right?
now, y'all just - Just go!
fine. We'll go.
but you better keep a fire extinguisher handy.
Julius, listen to me. - What?
all you do is pretend that you're the owner, you refuse to sell, and you do not back down, no matter what I say.
this is a violation of my rights.
okay, my right to privacy and my right to not get burned alive!
here he comes. - No! No, no, no, no, no!
he's here! - No!
it's "go" time! - No!
I'll be in the back. Don't go to the back!
if you know what is right in your mind, you will accept my offer and sell this drinking establishment!
just listen to reason.
no. No!
I will not sell this drinking establishment.
perhaps my associate can convince you otherwise.
Mr. Grant.
I'm not gonna s-sell.
now, who said anything about selling?
we're just two guys talking on a beautiful day.
no. I'm not gonna do it.
have you ever smelled flesh...
while it was burning?
one time, my uncle was barbecuing, and he put too much gas...
the smell sticks to you.
on your skin, in your hair.
it's a terrible thing. - Okay.
know what I'm saying?
you know what? I changed my mind. I want to sell.
if you could just give me like 10, 15 minutes, I'll get all my stuff out the office.
it's yours. Okay. You take it.
very well, then.
I guess you didn't need me after all.
Kenny, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny! Hang on.
this is what I've been dealing with.
he says yes, but he means no!
no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
it's infuriating! - No!
Yes. - What?
No! I'm saying - Okay.
I'm saying yes, and then I'm meaning yes.
but you just said no.
I know that. - I heard "yes."
he's playing mind games!
you playing mind games on me?
no. I am not...
playing mind ga I swear, okay? Yes
Kenny. He's messing with us.
he's messing with us both. You cut it out!
I don't like being messed with, and I don't like your sarcasm.
no. I'm not
listen. I'm trying to say this with as little sarcasm as possible.
you know what? You terrify me, okay?
who even wants a bar?
okay, it's too much work. I got people throwing up.
I got ugly chicks hitting on me.
I'm done. Take it! - Will you sell to Mr. Cummings?
who is that? - Do not play dumb!
I'm not playing
I don't know who that is!
I don't even own this bar!
see? That's it. That is it. Look.
I'm gonna give you one more shot.
answer the question - No or yes?
I don't remember what the question was.
that's it. That's it.
I am done playing your game, pal, okay?
you have made a wrong choice here today, sir. - I didn't mean to.
wrong choice.- I didn't mean to. You're a mind-gamer!
can you tell me what the right choice is, ple
mind-gamer!
Oh, dear god.
man.
you were right about that guy.
he's hanging on tight.
I'll do the job, but the price just went up a hundred-thousand.
can you make change?
no, see, that's not how this works.
here's how we do
I'm having an event at my house, a fund-raiser.
smart. Lot of money changing hands there.
that's it. That's it right there.
we're trying to save the wetlands.
turtles are dying, bro.
come by, eat some shrimp, give me the cash, I'll do the job.
nice and clean. - Yeah, yeah. Whatever helps the shrimp.
poor little guys.
no. We're saving the turtles. -We're eating the shrimp
we're eating the sh
we're eating the shrimp, saving the turtles.
but if I think you're trying to play me...
or if any surprises come my way, i'll burn you like a ball-park frank, brother.
see you at the party.
okay.
try that on for size.
sure is small.
sure we're gonna be able to hear each other?
you'll be able to hear a whole lot better than that dirty little mutt you gave me.
how is Keaton? Are you two best buddies yet?
he nips at my heels like they're dipped in bacon grease.
he's just trying to protect you.
from what? Walking?
you know, you're a good man, Jack.
bet your folks are proud of you.
Thanks.
100 cash, straight from hq.
all right, boys. You ready to do this thing?
let's go over the plan first, shall we? Yeah, good idea.
I'm gonna go into that party, I'm gonna eat a shrimp.
I'm gonna circle around back, find some of those tiny hot dogs.
my signal to you will be - When I dip them in the spicy mustard. - Ketchup.
okay. Okay. Great.
can we do it for real now?
Yeah. Okay. - Now, we get there.
I will go in first, then the two of you.
now, uncle Nate, you will hold the money because that is what you would normally do in this situation, correct?
or I could go to vegas and double it.
do it!
Yes, that's what we normally do. - Okay.
Dan, you will make contact with Griffin.
as soon as that happens, you give him the cash.
he'll take care of it from there.
all right, now, once the exchange happens, you got to get out of that room.
I do not want you in there when we take him out.
I don't want to be there.
you all ready?
it's time to roll.
good god, man. What are you wearing?
you said this was a party.
these are my party clothes.
you look like a waiter.
Really? - Yeah.
at a bar mitzvah. - Oh, no.
you know, it doesn't matter.
you're gonna be sitting in a van listening in on the wire.
which way is the head? - That way.
Oh, hey, Hodges
just the check, when you get a chance.
you all right, there, king?
just... Tell me everything is gonna work out the way we want it to.
the only thing I know for sure is you never know what's gonna happen for sure.
does not make me feel better.
sorry, partner. That's all I got.
okay. We are in. Where are you?
I'm outside. Griffin's by the pool.
we're on. He's by the pool.
what are you drinking?
whatever's closest.
what? - No, no, no, no, no. No drinking. We're working.
Jack, we're at a party. We're partygoers.
last I remember, people at parties drink.
am I wrong?
here you go. Up your quota.
and down your drain.
okay, guys. Can we just focus now, please? Thank you.
where are you?
where are you? Where are you?
I'm at your 3: 00.
1899/12/31 0: 03: 00
that's 11: 00, Dan. 3:00.
I'm not - I'm not wearing a watch.
I don't know where you are.
to your right. On the balcony.
gotcha.
Kenny! - Hey.
thanks for having us.
not a problem.
what a great event.
boy...
these poor, poor wetlands.
I tell you what - We should dry them up right now.
I agree.
not quite what this is about, but I feel you.
gentlemen... Let's do this.
all units, they're going down.
water slide. I love water slides.
do you use that Kenny, or is that for the turtles? - No, no, it's not for the turtles.
here, just, uh - Let's step over here.
all right.
let's see that money.
hang on just one second.
tell me again what I'm getting for my hundred g.
I'm doing the job, like we talked about.
right. Uh...
and w-what exactly does that job entail again?
what are you doing, Dan?
what are you asking me?
what I think Mr. Cummings is interested in is the process.
will you be using the same approach he does with his buildings - Am I right?
that's right. I'm a detail guy.
I love to know how things are done.
did you know that to make a french fry, they shoot a potato through a cutter at 70 miles an hour?
fact.
which is ironic because that's how fast it goes through my system.
right, right, right. You guys are funny.
for this extra large pile of money,
I will convince Mr. Grant to either sell his bar to you or to vacate completely.
see, I'm just - I'm not...
completely confident you're gonna be able to achieve that goal.
are you questioning my methods, sir? - What if I am?
well, i'll just use my charm.
if that doesn't work, I'll build a little campfire around his house and use his bones for firewood.
that should do the trick. - That'll do it. Yeah. Toasty.
Hodges, please tell me that you got that on tape. - Yeah, we got it.
fantastic.
all right. Bring your boys in.
here you go. I'm gonna go, uh, get some of those tiny, little shrimp puffs.
you guys talk.
you mind if I take a look?
help yourself.
Oh. I don't - I don't work here.
uncle Nate, that was phenomenal.
Yeah, it went down pretty smooth.
smooth? It was incredible. Where are you?
in the room off the main entry.
uncle Nate, where are you?
sorry for stealing the money, Jack. you can keep the dog
Dan, the money's gone! Nate stole the money!
what the... Hell?
Hey, what are you guys try
hold it right there.
dallas police department. You are under arrest.
we got a runner.
Jack, we got a runner!
Nate's gone. Get everybody out of here.
check the house. I'm gonna help Dan.
right. - thanks.
gardening bill must be a bitch.
all right, Kenny. Party's over! Come out now!
come on! We got dallas' finest!
they're on their way! - You're dead!
Dan, where are you?!
under the dude who's hitting me!
are you okay?
Yeah. Well, you know, face pain.
I'm all right.
I'm coming!
that's close enough. - Okay. Hey.
it's all over now, Kenny.
the cops are gonna be here as soon as they get around that lake of yours.
who owns a lake? - Shut up!
now, here's how this is gonna go down, Hoss.
first, I'm gonna kill your partner, here.
then I'm taking you hostage, and I'm getting the hell out of here. You understand?
well, that's too bad. You know why?
because, uh, I just worry about my partner's dog.
what do I care about a dog?
he's a good dog...
but he got a real bad habit.
you're a bad dude!
you're good, Jack.
all right. Let's go.
you know, the one good thing about this dog is that I now know how to bite a man on his ankle.
I think I'm gonna use that as my special skill when I'm applying for a new job.
you're not going anywhere.
Dan...Nate did what he did because of me.
I vouched for him, and he stole $100, 000 from the city of Dallas.
I'm done. - You're not done.
Nate didn't get away with anything.
two HOURS EARLIER
the only thing I know for sure is you never know what's gonna happen for sure.
does not make me feel better.
sorry, partner. It's all I got.
you swapped out the money?
I like to keep a step ahead.
I know a con man when I see one.
42 MINUTES EARLIER
thank you.
that is... Amazing!
but wait, wait.
why did you have me believe that the two of you were buddies?
well, I had to keep you hating him.
otherwise, you would have known something was up.
you see, when you spend time with a criminal, when you drink with him, when you urinate with him, when you go skinny-dipping in the mayor's pool with him, you learn something about his mind.
you went skinny-dipping with my uncle?
in the service of justice, yes, I did.
Dan, I don't know what to say.
thank you.
what? - Come on. Bring it in.
come on. You know it needs to happen.
come on. - Yeah.
come on. - All right.
come on, man. - Partner.
you're a good man, Dan Stark.
call me uncle Dan.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
stay the hell away fram my partner. He's my family, now
Oh! I'm sorry.
I should have called. - No.
uh, you said you wanted a guard dog, and this guy - He's - he's reckless hi! And, well, he doesn't listen, and he will nip your heels until they bleed, but he will guard the socks off you, so.
literally.
well, thank you.
Hey, what's up, partner? You want to come in?
we were just about to have some cake.
no, I'm okay. Thanks.
all right.
Thanks, Jack.
guard dog! Whoo!
all right!
west. 10: 02 P. M
I shouldn't have even brought it up. 11 HOURS LATER
any sicko who peeps on my l. T. Answers to me.
it's not a case, and even if it were, I'd be clinically insane to assign it to you.
well, then let us just ask around...
and see if anybody saw anything.
no, I filed a report. Everything is fine. I am fine.
okay. You left me no choice.
I'm relieving you of your duty. Wh... what?
you heard me, officer. I'm relieving you of duty.
gun and badge on the desk, please.
no. Dan, I really don't think you can do that.
yeah... no, that's not gonna happen.
okay, I'll tell you what is happening.
I'm gonna make this my personal mission...
to track down this peeping Tom.
come on, Jack-o. We're on the case.
no, it's... Damn it, it's not a case!
dripping wet.
Pat...Pat...Pat.
your skin feels alive. The air is cool.
the gooseflesh is coming.
okay, how is this helpful?
you would be surprised how often this works.
then you step over toward the window...
okay, now I'm confused here. Where's the towel?
I mean, are we talking headlights, or was he able to check under the hood? Okay, we're done here.
Hey, you want to catch a perv, you got to think like a perv.
all right, I-I barely saw anything. I was exhausted.
I had just come back from yoga.
yoga! Yes, yoga class!
of course!
this sicko scouts out yoga classes... Where... where young women with hard bodies...
go to expand their spirits... and to tighten their righteous glutes...
and whatnot.
he watches them bend.
he watches them fold. He watches them sweat.
and then he follows them home.
and he watches them shower.
actually, that's plausible.
Namaste.
I'm Detective Dan Stark.
I'm here to talk to you about a dangerous sexual predator... who's on the loose.
that's right... a peeper.
a depraved horndog... who is a threat to each and every one of you.
my partner, Jack Bailey, is handing you all a perv whistle.
uh, safety whistle.
I want you each to keep your perv whistles with you at all times. Why?
take a look at yourselves.
you all possess sexy...
lithe, incredibly flexible bodies.
make you all prime peeping targets.
that's right.
like you, darling... I mean, you can't go sporting a silhouette like that...
without taking some precautions.
there you go.
Hey, you know what, studly?
I'm even gonna give one to you.
I feel safer already. Do not fear!
I will personally be on patrol...
all night long in your neighborhood.
that's right. When the sun goes down, I will be right outside that window, watching...
...for that peeping Tom. - Uh...
Hey, uh, Dan, could I have a word?
Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Don't let me stop you.
Hey, you think I'm getting through to them?
Yeah, I think all of the blinds are gonna be shut tonight.
well, that's a start.
listen, I know that Ruiz is the real victim here, so I'm just concerned that you may be taking this... a little too personally.
no such thing as taking a case too personally.
well, no, it's just if you're too close, it could cloud your judgment.
Oh, bull diddley.
a man always does his best work when he's too invested, and I'm way too invested.
and bad guys better watch out.
relax, Wallace.
DRAYTON.HEADQUARTERS OFF.EL
now, how about you boys telling me what you found?
the six pages contained in the file before you, if made public, could bring this company to its knees.
it's a safety report.
not any safety report.
that is the blackbird file.
it was buried by the company six years ago.
incredibly sensitive material, so, naturally, I brought it to you.
Where'd you find this little gem?
I found it encrypted and deleted... on a discarded hard drive.
somebody tried really hard to make sure that was gone.
we see evidence that drayton oil... "and its owner, Patrick drayton, "have been knowingly profiting... from unsafe and illegal drilling practices.
yet somehow that never saw the light of day.
you have a hand in this, ashford?
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look.
this thing never came through my office.
I've never seen that report in my life.
I say we take it to the feds. Then what?
company goes down in flames, we lose our jobs.
in this economy? A-and good luck getting another gig... once we're known as a bunch of whistle-blowers.
but it's a safety report.
we know about it. We're liable.
people get hurt, it could bite us in the ass.
I'm all for doing the right thing.
but I need this job. Screw this job!
I can't even get an hour lunch break... out of these cheap corporate bastards.
I am not giving up my career...
so some loser computer tech... can live out his revenge fantasy.
hold on, hold on. I've got a better idea.
we're gonna sell it.
wait. Isn't that illegal?
this blackbird file gets out, our biggest competitor stands to make millions.
why shouldn't a couple mil land in our pockets?
that should take the sting out of unemployment.
I knew it. I knew it. I knew you'd come up with something great.
take down a corrupt company... and get a little reward for our troubles.
Theo, what do you say?
whatever. I hate this job. I like money. I'm in.
I love doing the right thing.
I went ahead and compiled a map of Ruiz's neighborhood... marked with all the registered sex offenders.
Oh, great.
uh, y-you do know this isn't your job.
Oh, I had a little free time. Okay.
according to the txdps database, within a 3-mile radius, there are 317 creeps officially on record, and I really like your tie.
Oh, uh, thank you.
uh, a-any convicted stalkers, voyeurs?
Nope, so I did a little extra snooping... and cross-referenced that database with two others...
and created the matrix of sexual deviancy.
you don't have to call it that.
actually, let's not call it that. - Hey.
Hey! Hey, you!
sorry. I...
we don't know each other that well.
I just got caught up in the moment.
all right, I'm just gonna go.
thank you. - Bye.
so, hey, about dinner tonight...
Kyle got off work early, so he can join us.
uh, ye... well, you know, uh, the thing is, I- I really have a lot of work that I ought to get to.
I just keep thinking to myself, you know, you and Kyle, you'd probably really get along...
if... if you just spent some time together.
you haven't really had a chance.
well, maybe some other time.
my evening is gonna be packed with sexual deviancy.
I'm just gonna go ahead... and assume that makes sense in another conversation.
all right. Keep moving.
official police business here. Nothing to see.
peeping Tom on the loose.
now, what have we here?
hello.
well, now. We're getting kinky.
what?
No! Stop!
stop! Police!
Jack! This is bigger than a peeping Tom!
we got a murderin' Jane!
industrial grade, polyethylene tarp, vapor tape, no sign of a forced entry, and a single bullet wound... to the head with a silencer.
Dan, this is a professional hit.
Yeah, or one hell of a kink fest.
I mean, if you hadn't interrupted the killer, there wouldn't be a shred of evidence.
now, did you get a good look at her?
no, not good enough, but...
I can't emphasize to you enough... how attractive she was.
I mean, just big, ol' pouty lips...
not me.
dead guy.
wait. I'm gonna answer it.
what are you gonna say?
I'm gonna imitate the guy's voice.
I'm good at doing impressions.
you can't imitate his voice. You didn't even hear him talk.
Hello?
Hey, Theo. I-I've been having second thoughts.
if they realize we took that file, we all could be dead.
we never should have stolen that file.
stolen that file.
w- who did we steal the file from?
Theo?
Yeah. Theo.
w- what's wrong with your voice, Theo?
nothin'. Who is this? Who are you?
who's this? Who are you?!
G...
I think he caught on.
you think? I tell you what, Jack-o.
these guys are in over their head.
I don't think they even know it yet.
Hey, buddy.
what part of "keeping our contact to a minimum..."
do you not understand?
somebody's onto us.
they've got Theo's phone.
what are you talking about?
I called Theo. It wasn't Theo.
it was, like, some low-voiced freak.
look, pull yourself together, man.
Theo was probably... just stoned out of his mind playing video games.
I bet he was just messing with you.
maybe. Maybe.
now, we stick to my plan, all right?
the day after tomorrow, I'm gonna sell the blackbird file, and then what do we do?
we stay out of town until things cool down.
exactly. Get yourself to a beach, buddy.
get a tan. Please.
okay. You'll... you'll... You'll check on Theo?
if it'll make you happy, absolutely.
I assure you there won't be any more surprises.
Hey, babe.
what are you doing here?
I'm coming to get you. You ready to go?
Yes. In five minutes.
uh, by the way, Jack is not coming...
it's just you and me tonight.
well, that's too bad.
so, I had an interesting day at work today.
and what do we have here?
open it up.
first class to a tropical island... in the middle of nowhere.
what do you say we disappear for a couple weeks?
white, Sandy beach?
the flight leaves in two days.
there's no way I can drop everything.
come on, sweets. We need this.
no, it's impossible. Look at my desk.
come on. You can't say no.
look, when an opportunity like this comes along, you just have to reach out, and you got to grab it.
all right.
I'm gonna rearrange my schedule.
good. Do it.
we both could use the time alone... together, without any distractions.
good morning, neighbor.
Dan. What the hell are you doing here?
well, in light of recent murderous activity... in your neighborhood, I took it upon myself...
to park the aluminum love cradle close to your house... so I could keep watch over you during the night.
it's the least I can do as your bodyguard.
no, no, no, no, no. No.
you are not my bodyguard. I do not need a bodyguard.
I understand you're upset, but let's talk about it... while izzy and I escort you to your vehicle.
no, that's not gonna happen, okay, because we are investigating a murder...
that has happened in my neighborhood, and I'm not gonna let you and this thing that you live in...
get in my way.
you're strong, and you know I dig that.
but I want you to take this. Please?
take it with you. It's a whistle.
keep it with you at all times.
so if you encounter somebody... who's making you uncomfortable and invading...
...your personal space...
I guess I should have expected that.
I'm not a helpless victim, Dan. I'm a police lieutenant.
now go get me a lead on that murder case!
lieu, can you tell me where the water main is?
cause, uh, I got to hook up the plumbing.
I got a... I got a situation in my bathroom here.
you know what? Don't worry about it.
don't worry about it. I'll figure it out.
this is Detective Jack Bailey... with the Dallas police department.
I need a trace on a blocked ca...
no, yeah, sure. I'll hold again. Why not?
I mean, it's only a murder investigation!
there's an easier way... to get your caller's name and address. How?
here is your caller's name and address.
Oh. That was easy.
I traced it myself.
we're working with the phone company on another case, and I've become familiar with their procedures.
and their passwords.
I really hope I'm not taking away... any of the fun, detective-y part of your job.
no. This is, uh...
this is good. Thank you.
have no fear.
ana has been safely escorted to her office un-ogled.
that's incredibly comforting.
okay, where are we on our murder case?
we need what Frank used to call a lead.
Yeah, everybody calls it a lead.
you got one? Yeah.
thanks to Samantha.
Yeah, thanks to me.
Scott Wallace.
all right? He's our mystery caller.
got an address right there.
nice work. Let's get over there before it's too late.
Scott WALLACE'S CONDO
Scott WALLACE'S CONDO IT'S TOO LATE
Hello?
I want my money back. You're a disaster.
relax. Everything is under control.
under control? I paid for a corporate cleaning.
not a giant mess.
I thought you were gonna try and buy him off first.
the hacker was unreliable.
the cleanest solution was to eliminate him.
besides, he was a loser. No one would have even noticed he was missing.
well, somebody noticed! You left a body and a witness!
that was a fluke.
look, you hired me for my reputation because I'm the best.
the situation is under control.
this time, no one will even notice a crime was comm...
Mr. Wallace?!
I want this...
Mr. Wallace! Dallas p. D! Your front door was open!
Mr. Wallace?
Mr. Wallace!
Hey.
Hey, wake up, buddy.
wake up.
it's a suicide.
hang on.
he's gone.
Oh, you never get used to it, Jack-o...
being around a dead body.
zombie! Shoot him in the head! It's the only way!
stop! Stop, Dan!
he's trying to say something. He's trying to talk. He's what?!
what? What?
Drayton...Oil... What?
...trying to kill me.
was it a woman? Was it a hot woman?
Dan. Shh!
blackbird.
stay with us!
stay with me, brother! You're gonna be fine!
this is Detective Jack Bailey.
I need an ambulance right away!
do not go into the light! Do not go into the light! You've got to be kidding me.
h- hey... let me see...
uh, can you make those... M- make the lips bigger.
luscious and pouty... Pouty lips.
and put her in some kind of hot, little, uh, nurse's outfit.
well, yeah, was she wearing a nurse's outfit? No.
just trust me on this.
put her in a nurse's outfit. Something short.
well, we have a murderer in my neighborhood, and our only witness is in critical condition.
so please tell me we've got something else.
Yeah, uh, from what I've learned, blackbird is an independent safety report... on the oil industry.
it comes out every five years or so.
a lot of companies fell in its crosshairs, with the exception of Drayton oil.
for some reason, their report came back squeaky-clean.
why would somebody be murdered over a positive safety report?
exactly. I mean, it's got to be a- a lie or a cover-up, maybe?
well, what the hell are we waiting for?
let's get over there, kick some doors down at that company, see if anyone recognizes our murderin' Jane.
Ooh, man. Smokin'. Ooh. Yeah.
okay, wait. Hold on.
the C. E.O. Patrick Drayton, is one of the most powerful businessmen in Dallas.
I mean, if he's involved, we need to learn more before we show our hand.
so, how do we do that?
we need someone on the inside.
and I know just the guy.
I. T. Department.
Theo, please.
Oh, you didn't hear, man? Theo was murdered.
what? What are you saying?
Yeah, it happened last night.
I guess they found his body in his house, and he'd been shot.
Krista, get in here!
is everything okay?
Yes. I need to see Mr. Wallace in my office.
now. Oh, you didn't hear.
Mr. Wallace tried to commit suicide last night.
what? I know. Pills.
Rhindi heard he was in a coma.
I knew he had that, like, divorce or whatever, but that was like months ago.
clear my schedule! Cancel everything!
okay.
and what should I tell the two cops who are here to see you?
cops?
Jack! Hey. Good to see you.
uh, this is my partner, Dan stark. How you doin'?
what are you talking about? He's not bad-looking.
what? Uh, Kyle, listen.
I- I know that we haven't always been on the same page, but, uh, I was wondering if you could help us out.
of course. Of course, man. What, uh... what do you need?
you just name it, buddy. Name it.
do you know anything about a blackbird file?
No! I mean, uh, nope. No, I haven't.
here's the deal... Your boss, Drayton, he knows all about this blackbird file, so we need to get some face time with the chief hombre.
Mr. Drayton is... Is very busy.
well, maybe you can talk with him about the blackbird file.
I mean, it's early in the investigation, so if you would please not mention the police, it would...
are you okay?
Absolutely.
never better.
in fact, why don't we go back to my office, and, uh, I'll check Mr. Drayton's schedule.
cool.
all right! We're moving.
I got it. Thank you.
sure. Be right back.
just, uh, make yourselves comfortable.
damn it!
I'm taking a mulligan. She's distracting me.
here.
I want you to pay a visit to a golf buddy of mine.
his name's marshal Hewitt.
the C. E.O. of Hewitt petroleum? Exactly.
I saw him in the pro shop. He smiled at me.
the bastard never smiles at me.
I think he knows something...
about my little... Business problem.
think he's trying to acquire the file from one of your employees?
figure it out.
clean it up.
that's your job.
Oh. My bad.
is it just me, or does Kyle seem...
distracted, you know, suspicious?
well, he sure didn't want to be talking to you, that's for sure.
right? Yeah.
you think it might be because he knows that you know... that he's curling your true love's toes?
no, I don't think that's it.
it's just, uh, something doesn't feel right.
I mean, it's been 25 minutes. Where the hell is he?
you think that smarmy little lawyer knows something?
I think it's time to find out.
let's roll.
excuse me.
Where's Kyle?
Oh, um, Mr. Ashford actually left for the day.
What?! He told us to wait in his office.
we're sitting in there, kicking carp... come on.
Yeah. Hewitt.
Yes, uh, I have the, um...
Bird-related document that we previously discussed.
the fee that we agreed upon? Yeah.
okay, I'm at the location right now, all right?
I want this stupid thing out of my life. When can you get here?
soon.
uh, I'm sending my, uh, a-associate... to make the exchange. I don't care about the details.
just make sure they're here fast and tell them to bring the cash.
Kyle! Come out! Now!
okay. Doesn't look like he's here.
Yeah, we'll see about that. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on, now.
I think you may be a-a little too close... to this thing, personally.
too close? Yeah.
I distinctly recall you telling me... a good cop should take every case too personally.
true, but I neglected to inform you... there... there's an exception clause.
Oh, an exception clause. Yeah.
it's called the "if you do this, Liz will never sleep with you again" clause.
okay, you're gonna look like a jealous lunatic... if you kick this in. Okay. I am not jealous.
Kyle is hiding something.
I know it. And you know it. Now, move.
Oh, don't... Don't get me wrong.
now, being too close personally, it helps when you're busting punks, but it does not go over so well with the ladies.
you care for Lizzie.
I'm not gonna stand here and watch you ruin that.
now, if this is our guy, we'll find another way to bust him, okay?
Kyle is a criminal, and I'm gonna prove it.
not because I'm jealous. But because I'm a cop.
take a look at this.
what you got there?
Liz's toothbrush is here.
her clothes are here. Her work is here.
she's practically living here, Dan! L-let's just focus...
on the kyle/blackbird angle of it all, okay? Oh, God.
you know, I knew that she was, you know, talking about moving in with this slimeball, but I didn't know that it was so...Serious.
Jack, only pain comes from this. I mean, take it from me.
I've searched the houses of countless boyfriends... of former lady loves of mine.
what is that?!
this is mine!
Dan, this is mine!
that sow's got a corkscrew tail.
that's cute. I like that.
we got it, uh, when we went... on an awesome wine-tasting trip.
it was one of our first dates.
you know what... Kyle is just gonna have to find...
some other way to open up his fancy wines... because I am taking Corky back.
Corky"? We named it corky.
okay, Jack, you've compiled enough evidence... to convict Kyle in any court across the land...
of having repetitive sexual contact... with your lady love, okay?
he's guilty. Let's move on.
let's go talk to the C. E.O. of this oil company.
Ruiz got me the address of his country club.
that's a good idea. You go that way.
I'm gonna check out what's on Kyle's computer.
No! Jack-o! Jack! Do not do that.
look, I-I may not know much about computers, but there's one thing I do know.
there are pictures on that machine... of Kyle and Lizzie in Flagrante.
you don't know that.
never underestimate a man's need... to photograph his sexual conquests, Jack.
get to the point.
this is what I'm gonna offer you.
I will view these photos for you privately.
no, you can't look at the photos, 'cause there are no photos, Dan!
so just go, all right? Go talk to the C. E.O. okay?
taking it too personally! What about you, Dan?!
I mean, you parked your trailer... in front of the lieutenant's house, claiming to be her own personal bodyguard.
what's going on with your own personal, inappropriate case?
you know what? Don't worry about that.
I got that covered.
l. T! Welcome home.
Julius, what are you doing here at my home?
d- detective Dan told me about the sexual peeper dude... that you got all up in your neighborhood.
he was like, "hey, you want to take a couple shifts?" I'm like, "yeah.
wait, wait, wait. Some shifts of what?
Oh, uh, bodyguarding.
Yeah, no. Defending your honor.
you know, providing vigilance 24/7... to protect you from criminal activity.
Julius, is that my apron?
uh, yes. Yes, it is. And you know what?
you should get a better lock for your back window.
I'm gonna kill him. You know what?
I'm gonna just do yours medium-rare.
is that... okay. Yeah.
I- it's good to have protection, l. T. 'cause even good neighborhoods can be unsafe.
Liz. Hi.
where are you?
nowhere, you know.
just working, just following a lead.
that's funny 'cause...
looks to me like you're sitting at Kyle's desk...
for God only knows what reason.
I can explain.
I think you'd better.
yesterday an executive at Kyle's company was attacked.
okay, now, it was a professional hit, and the victim said that the killer worked for drayton oil.
okay, skip to the part where you break into my house, Jack.
your house?
Kyle's house. Are you happy? Does it matter?
Yes, it matters. It matters a lot.
well, so you... So you moved in with him.
don't change the subject.
Dan and I went to go ask Kyle a few questions.
and he ran, all right? He was acting suspicious.
are you insinuating that Kyle's somehow involved in this?
well, he wasn't acting like an innocent person would.
Oh, my God. My God. I knew it!
you have never wanted to give Kyle a chance.
you've been gunning for him... since before you even met him, Jack!
that is not what this is about.
Hey, um, on your way over here, did you happen to pick up, um, uh, what's that...
a search warrant?
I'm only asking you... because I'm assistant district attorney.
look at these e-mails, okay?
correspondence with the two victims.
from his co-workers. Okay.
he has plane tickets, Liz. He's skipping the country.
those are tickets to our vacation, Jack.
why are you even looking at those?
to the maldive islands, okay?
a place that has no extradition treaty... with the United States.
coincidence?
why are you doing this, Jack?
because I'm a cop. I want to know why Kyle ashford ran the second he saw me.
maybe because he thinks he's being framed... by my crazy, jealous ex-boyfriend.
okay, Liz, I'm gonna say this as simply as I can.
I believe your boyfriend stole something from his company...
and that someone is trying to kill him to get it back.
well... I'm calling Kyle.
great. Call him. I've been trying... to get him on the phone all day, but he won't take my call.
well, he'll talk to me.
Hey, babe. Can't talk.
I'm about to jump into a meeting.
Hey, are you okay?
uh, yeah. Of course.
listen, this is crazy.
Jack is telling me that I need to warn you about some woman, a hit man, a-a hit woman, if you will.
she's got, uh, blond hair. I guess she's tall.
she's...
sexy lips.
he seems to think that this hit woman, uh, tried to kill one of your co-workers earlier... and that you are next on her list.
got to run, babe. Be home soon.
what did he say?
he's on his way home.
you can ask him yourself.
great.
may I have a word with you, your wealthiness?
this is a private club. Members only.
Oh, really? It's a good thing that I got me a day pass.
well, I've got me a tee time.
so whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait... until after my round.
you can call my lawyer. I've done nothing wrong.
you know, in my experience, golfers are bullies and cowards.
it's something about the... the... the club...
being so darn big... and the balls being so darn small.
call Marcus in security, please.
Yeah, do that.
while we're waiting, uh, Do you recognize... Her?
never seen that woman before in my life.
are you sure, now? You want to take another look?
she's quite an exquisite creature.
wish I could help you. I really do. Yeah.
you know anything about the blackbird file?
holy... well, I'll take that as a "yes.
get out of my clubhouse. Where's Marcus?
you, sir... You have devoted your life... to a wussy sport which you will never master.
and you're a terrible liar.
you revealed yourself to me.
you can expect to hear from my attorney.
Oh, hey.
okay. All right.
someone must have tipped Ashford off.
he got away. You're fired!
he tried to kill me.
you have any proof?
Jack, he's obviously not the bad guy here.
have you seen his car? It is riddled with bullet holes.
it's riddled with bullet holes, Jack, and someone kicked in my front door.
that was me, actually.
okay, I don't know what's going on here, all right?
I'm just... I'm trying to do the right thing.
okay, well, w-why didn't you take it to Liz?
I mean, she works for the D. A.
well, the other two people who know about the file... are either dead or in the hospital.
I'm not gonna put other people's lives in danger.
especially Liz's.
I'm sure you'd do the same thing.
Jack, I'd feel much better... if we could get him under police protection.
fine, I'll take you into custody... until we can sort this whole thing out.
thank you, buddy. In the meantime, I'm gonna need that blackbird file.
Absolutely.
I- I don't have it on me. I hid it.
well, then, you're gonna take me to where you hid it.
Oh, my God. Okay.
if you cook like that, you can break into my house any day.
well, thank you.
thank you very much. You know what?
I- I wanted to do dessert, but I didn't find any in there.
would you mind if I broke into one of these houses... and got, like, an apple pie?
no, we have enough crime in this neighborhood... with our peeping Tom and our murderer.
don't even worry about it. Y'all will catch him eventually.
y'all always caught me.
Yeah, well, I'll drink to that. Hmm.
hmm. Yes.
may I use your facilities?
absolutely, and you can even go... through the front door like a non-criminal.
Ah, you know, I would use the, um...
but Dan hasn't hooked up the plumbing, so it's... it's just kind of gathering.
okay, o-okay. I got it. I got it. Thank you. Right. That's too much.
you're right. Be right back.
that's him! That's the peep... He peeped all over me!
you're a long way from your yoga mat.
missed you in class today.
Oh, geez. D-did he try to get rough with you?
did you use your whistle?
I mean, I can't believe I wasn't there for you.
well, somehow I muddled through.
well, the least I can do is give you your command back.
Hey, listen up, everybody! No.
important announcement here.
lieutenant Ruiz is back in charge.
let's give her a round of applause. Dan, I was always in ch...
Oh, thanks.
okay, that's it. Let's fight some crime. Party's over. Thanks.
all right. That's good.
listen, now that that's taken care of, can you please just give Jack a hand?
he's got a big break in the blackbird case.
Yeah, I don't think Jack's really in the mood... to have me looking over his shoulder right now.
when have you ever taken "no" for an answer?
okay, look. I- I got to confess. I...
I've pretty much been deliberately avoiding... getting to know you.
Really? Yeah.
but, um, you know, now that I know... that you're just trying to do the right thing,
I feel kind of bad.
well, to be fair, I wasn't exactly... champing at the bit to hang out with you, either.
Really?
hell, no, man. When you bailed on dinner, I was thrilled.
huh. So all this time I've been avoiding you, you've been avoiding me.
Oh, yeah. Definitely.
and I thought we didn't have anything in common.
Hey, Jack around?
Oh, he and Kyle went... to pick up the blackbird file from his ranch.
Kyle's ranch.
not Jack's ranch. I don't think Jack has a ranch.
Hey, do you need another sketch done?
because I could put her in a leather cat suit this time.
I like the way you think, darling, but, no, no, no.
your first sketch worked like a charm.
I mean, any innocent man... would have taken one look at that drawing...
and started studying the curves... and asking about the sexy outfit and whatnot.
Drayton didn't give it a second thought.
our murderer may be a woman, but Drayton is definitely pulling the strings, and I'm gonna take him down before he strikes again.
that reminds me. Uh, Mr. Wallace is dead.
What?! He was killed in the hospital this morning.
two HOURS EARLIER
Kyle's got to be the next target, and Jack's out there on the ranch with him?
please tell me he took backup.
I think they went alone.
Oh, damn it!
Ah, don't worry. The maid will get it.
come on in.
so, you played quarterback.
Oh, yeah. High School.
gave it up when I went to Yale, though.
so, the blackbird file's over in the family safe.
this will just take a second.
let's see.
do you mind, buddy?
fine.
I'll be in the east wing.
yeah?
what the hell you doing out there... with a murderin' Jane on the loose?!
and Wallace... I'm fine. Wait. Slow down.
they got to Wallace! He's dead!
really dead this time.
Kyle is next. Jack, you need backup.
N- no, Dan. I'm fine.
I'm just here to get the file, and then I'm gonna go back to the station.
everything's gonna be fine.
Hey, Ashford.
W... this isn't what it looks like.
you're fired.
everything's gonna be fine.
no, Jack!
police! Drop it!
he shot my arm! I was aiming for your heart.
damn, maybe my stance is off.
I'm really bleeding here!
barely!
just lower your weapon. You first!
listen. We can make this work for us.
you tried to sell the blackbird file to the highest bidder.
now you want to cut a deal?
I... I knew it.
shut up, Jack! Look, hey.
nobody knows about this except him.
so you're saying we kill him, and all of this could just go away.
Hey, your words, not mine.
drop it, Drayton, all right? This is over!
guns down. I mean it, gentlemen.
what are you doing here?! I thought I told you to get lost!
I'm not about to let my record get tainted... by one dissatisfied customer and a few lucky cops.
get him up. We're moving this in the kitchen.
no. I'm not stepping foot on linoleum.
if you're gonna kill us, you got to kill us somewhere difficult to clean.
have it your way.
36 seconds earlier
if you're gonna kill us, you got to kill us somewhere difficult to clean.
have it your way.
Fore!
now, that's a sport!
Kyle! Kyle, a little help, buddy!
you all right, there, partner?
Yeah. Thanks for the whistle.
I got the blackbird file.
I got the murdering Jane.
Where's Kyle?
did we get them?
they're buying this whole whistle-blower story.
unbelievable.
I don't get it. That twerp should be going to jail.
it's like they're planning a ticker-tape parade.
what are we gonna do?
we don't have a case. We don't have any proof.
even Liz believes him. I'm telling you, man.
I got a half a mind to wander over there... and punch that twerp in the kisser.
no, you were right, Dan.
the second I went after Kyle...
I lost Liz either way.
Hey, buddy.
I just wanted to stop by and say... No hard feelings.
look, Kyle, you can tell them whatever you want, but we both know what really happened.
what are you talking about?
I told your fellow detectives the truth.
I...
face it, Jack.
it's your word against mine.
now, who are they gonna believe?
an upstanding whistle-blower... Or some pathetic ex-boyfriend...
who kicked my door down without a warrant?
is this really something... that you want to drag into a court case?
what would Liz think?
whistle-blower.
Whistle-blower!
Ow! That really hurt!
no, no, okay, there's no other way to explain it, but all of a sudden I hear this, like, shriek.
wait, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.
there's plenty of other ways to describe it.
like a manly yelp. - No, it wasn't...
Yeah, it was a shriek, okay?
and so, then the peeper comes jumping over the fence...
okay, and then you come in...
Hey, she comes in, and she sacks this dude...
like a linebacker, okay?
it was just like... bam! It was brutal.
okay, he had it coming.
I tell you this much, Dan. She doesn't need a bodyguard.
she got moves like, linebacker, heisman trophy.
Yeah, I know. I didn't want anybody to hurt you.
well, I'm touched, but do me a favor, sweetheart, and move this giant beer can out of here by tomorrow, or I'm gonna show you some moves he's talking about.
Hey, I thought you would be halfway... to the maldive islands about now.
plans changed.
what happened?
I don't know what happened at the ranch.
you'll have to tell me.
but I do know you, and I know... that you wouldn't be hiding in the closet.
is that what he said? Yes.
amazing.
I just... I couldn't believe when he said that.
I- I thought, "if you're gonna lie to me about that, what else are you lying to me about?..."
and just to make himself look better, too.
and... and I just don't think you would ever do that.
you tell me the truth...
even when it makes me hate your guts.
I've done it many times.
anyway, um, Kyle and I broke up, so...
well...
I'm not very sorry to hear that.
thank you for your honesty.
would you like a beverage?
Yes, I want a drink more than anything right now.
corky, what are you doing here?
corky didn't really want to be with Kyle anymore.
smart pig.

I'm The Last One That Saw Her.
they'll Suspect Me?
Yes.
Oh, My God.
then Why.
I Need To Go To The Police, Don't I?
I Just Spoke To Them.
I Agreed To Surrender You In The Morning,
but These First Few Hours Of An Investigation Are Always The Most Important.
anything Can Be Misinterpreted.
won't My Coming Here Be Misinterpreted?
unfortunately, It's A Risk We're Going To Have To Take.
this Early In An Investigation, It's All About Leverage,
and You Have The Right To Remain Silent,
so Our Leverage Is How Much Access We Allow The Police.
they Want More, We Want Less, So We're The Gatekeepers To You.
Yep.
we're Going To Have You Take A Polygraph, Mr. Rucker.
it's Not About Truth Or Innocence.
I'm Sorry, A Lie Detector Test?
Yes, I Need Information So I Know How Much To Let You Talk Versus How Much To Keep You Silent.
yeah?
they're On Their Way To You Now.
they're Not Going To Wait Till Tomorrow.
how Long?
20 Minutes, Ten If They Send Someone From Central.
you Have 15 Minutes.
here You Go.
thank You.
in About Five Minutes The Police Are Going To Burst Through Those Doors.
I Need You To Be On For The Next 48 Hours.
that's How Long They Have To Charge Him With Murder Or Release Him.
it's Now Going To Be The Most Crucial 48 Hours Of His Life.
if They Charge Him, Bail's A Long Shot And He Could Spend A Year In Prison Before He Comes To Trial.
even If He's Found Innocent, That's A Year Of His Life Gone, So These 48 Hours Are Gonna Be Like A Mini-Trial.
we're Gonna Get The Cops To Look Somewhere Else And Get Him Released.
okay?
I Rode Up In The Elevator With Him.
either He's The Best Actor In The World Or He Had No Idea This Happened.
okay, Good, It'd Be Nice If He Was Innocent.
it's A Better Hand.
come On, I Thought We Had An Agreement.

Mr. Rucker, You Are Under Arrest For The Murder Of Lisa Pruitt.
you Have The Right To Remain Silent.
anything You Say Can And Will Be Used Against You In A Court Of Law.
easy, Easy.
you Have The Right To An Attorney.
if You Can't Afford An Attorney --Jason!
ma'am, No, You Need To Step Back.
okay, Here We Go-- 48 Hours.
the Panic Alarm Was Triggered From Inside?
yeah-- Yes, Ma'am.
so The Alarm Wasn't Triggered From Someone Breaking In.
it Was Triggered From Someone Already In?
Yeah, That's Why They're Thinking The Husband Did It-- Because He Could Disarm The System.
and Who Else Can Disarm The System?
who Else, Uh, Besides Mr. Rucker?
Yes, Mr. Horner.
well, Uh, Housekeeper And Lisa The Babysitter.
miss Pruitt? --yeah
what?
you Said "Lisa.
Yeah, Lisa Pruitt. Why?
what's The Housekeeper's Name?
I Don't Know.
but You Know Lisa's.
I Try To Be Observant.
hmm, Selectively Observant.
you Can Also Disarm The Alarm System.
it's Not Just The Housekeeper And Lisa The Babysitter, Is It?
I Don't Think I Want To Answer Any More Of Your Questions.
you Don't Need To Answer Any More Of Her Questions.
so.
did You Find The Murder Weapon?
the Poker?
Yeah, It's Right Outside The Door, Right Where The Husband Dropped It.
the Husband?
Yeah.
and How Does That Play, Tony?
he Lets Himself In, Tries To Rape Her, She Resists, He Kills Her.
steals The Missing Red Purse, Triggers The Alarm On The Way Out, Make It Look Like A Burglary.
see, I'm Liking The Security Guard.
Oh, You're Such An Unbiased Observer.
guard Sees The Babysitter, Wants Her, Lets Himself In, Disarms The Code,
tries To Rape Her, She Resists, Then Steals Her Pretty Red Purse,
triggers The Alarm On The Way Out To Make It Look Like A Burglary.

that Hubby Needs To Reassert His Manhood.
Hey, Listen, I'm All For Dime Store Psychoanalysis If It Helps Me Close A Case.

content.
you Know, Sometimes The Fog Dissipates, The Rain Disappears, And Everything Makes Sense.
you've Made A Decision? --I Have.
Alicia Around?
uh, No.
so, You Know The Offer You Made?
what Offer Would That Be?
freedom Today If I Don't Fight The Conviction, Stay Disbarred, Can't Run Again.
Yes, That Offer.
smart Move Would Be To Take It.
so I Have To Imagine You're Going To Tell Me To Go To Hell.
you Want The Longer Version?
can't Wait.
I Wouldn't Get Too Comfortable In That Office Of Yours.
I'm Gonna Testify.
would It Help If I Told You That That's A Mistake?
look, If I End Up In A 12 By 12 Cell For The Next Nine Years,
I Just Want To Know That I Did Everything I Could.
will You Call Alicia For Me?
no service
I Liked Her. I Wouldn't Hurt Her.
so, You Were At The Movies?
Yes.
legend Of Condor Hero. It's A Wuxia Movie.

Cary, Can I Talk To You For A Second?
are You On Something?
Cary: No.
I Like You, Alicia.
I Like You, Too, Cary.
I Need You To Pull It Together Now.
okay.
okay, Here We Go.
pulling.
I Showed You His Lie Detector Test.
a Partial Test You Conducted.
by A Top FBI Polygraphist, And He Was Passing With Flying Colors.
then Let Me Question Him.
with Conditions.
I Could Charge Him Right Now.
then Do It.
what's Stopping You?
you Don't Have Enough.
I Want Two Of My Lawyers To Stay With Him At All Times.
they Have The Freedom To Consult Him With The Camera Off.
and I Want 15-Minute Breaks Every Hour.
no Food?
pizza.
in One Hour.
he Is A Little Creepy.
walks Around Like He's Saving The Neighborhood.
you Know What?
we Had A Break-In Right After He Started Six Months Ago.
Really?
what Did They Take?
that's The Thing.
just Some Money From Our Bureau, Some Clothes From My Closet And Popsicles.
popsicles?
Yeah.
I Think He Did It Just So He Could Come And Take A Report, You Know?
same Thing With Three Other Houses In The Neighborhood.
it's Just Creepy.
then What Did You Do?
well, I Dropped Her At The House.
I Made Sure She Had My Cell Number, Then I Went To The Movies.
did You See The Security Guard Anywhere Near The House?
the Guard? Sure He's Always Around.
you Seen Him Around Much When You Dropped Off Lisa Pruitt?
I Guess.
Yes, Thank You, Mr. Gardner.
we're Following All Leads.
Really?
Yes.
because I Know You Have An Unoccupied Interrogation Room.
so, Very Simply, You're In Jail Now Because You Dp'd Cases, Is That Right?
it Is.
could You Explain?
well, Dp Means Declining To Prosecute.
and What Cases Did You Decline To Prosecute?
uh, Investigations Into Allegedly Corrupt Real Estate Practices.
what Was Happening Is That Speculators Were Buying Depressed Properties On The Land Near Where Olympic Stadiums Were To Be Built.
why Did You Stop These Investigations?
they Sound Promising.
for A Very Simple Reason-- Lashkar-Etaiba,
which Is A Jihadist Extremist Group Believed To Be Active In Chicago,
allegedly Involved In Last Year's Attacks In Mumbai.
and The Fact Of The Matter Is, Is I Pulled These Investigators From These Other Cases
because I Believed That The Pursuit Of These Extremists Was More Important.
in Fact, There Was An Arrest In October?
that's Correct.
that Would Be David Coleman Headley, Allegedly A Key Member Of Let.
so.
why Didn't You Testify To All Of This At Your Trial?
I Should Have.
but There Was A Larger Consideration.
a Failing In My Personal Life Was Being Used Against Me.
I Wanted To Protect My Family Against Further Hurt.
I Knew That I Couldn't Testify About These False Corruption Charges
unless I Was Then Willing To Testify About.
my Life.
thank You, Mr. Florrick.
Mr. Landry, Your Witness.
actually, My Witness, Your Honor.
um, Your Honor?
objection.
on What Grounds?
Mr. Childs, You're Not The Judge Here.
apologies, Your Honor.
uh, Mr. Childs Is Instrumental In The Matters Directly Under Consideration Here, Your Honor.
those Are The Grounds.
but Mr. Florrick Is Such A Great American Hero.
your Honor.
and Has Been Instrumental In The Defense Of Our Great Nation.
your Honor!
surely He Wouldn't Mind A Few Softball Questions.
my Goodness, The Sarcasm Is As Thick As Butter Here Today.
I Don't Mind Being Questioned By Mr. Childs, Your Honor.
in Fact, I Welcome It.
well, Then, Let's Take A Short Break For Lunch, And Pick Up Right Where We Left Off.
she Was Selling Drugs.
I Bet It Was A Drug Deal Gone Bad.
come On, You Don't Know That.
I Knew Her Better Than You Did.
look, I Think It Was That Guy From The Neighborhood Where She Babysat.
she Always Said He Was A Nuisance.
Hi.
excuse Me, But Do You Guys Have A Minute?
Yeah.

burkle, Or, Uh, Rucker.
she Said That He Was Getting Too Close.
making Her Uncomfortable.
they Were Working On Something Together, Some Project, And She Said She Was Gonna Quit.
so, Um, Do You Want Me To Make A Statement Or Something?
we'll Call You, Okay?
all Right.
Yeah.
look, Um, Not Right Now, But Maybe You And I Could Meet Up Later, And I Could Take It Down Then.
so, You Threw Away Your Ticket Stub. Is That It?
Yes.
okay.
and This Chinese Movie-- What Was It About?
legend Of The Condor Heroes?
it's About Two Sons Learning Martial Arts In Mongolia.
sounds Exciting.
you Know Chinese?
Chinese? No
then How Did You Understand It?
that's Odd.
let's Take A Break For A Second.
Yes.
let's Do That, Mr. Gardner.
detective? The Camera.
what's Going On?
it Has Nothing To Do With This.
Mr. Rucker, You Don't Understand.
the Decisions You Make Right Now You'll Regret For Decades If You Don't Make Them Right.
Cary: Yeah.
look, I Just.
you Don't Know What It's Like To Be Out Of Work, To Be Stuck At Home.
I Do.
so Tell Me.
I Have A Place To Work, To Do.
but. But Just On Spec. I'm Not Being Paid.
and You Do This Work At An Office?
that's Where You Were?
you Weren't At The Movies?
Yeah, It's Just A Studio To Draw.
it's Nothing. It's The Size Of A Closet.
will: And Lisa Pruitt Was Working With You?
our Investigator Is Talking To A Friend Of Pruitt's.
she Did Some Writing For Your Graphic Novel?
Yes.
were You Sleeping With Her?
no.
so, What's In The Studio?
what's In There That The Police Might Misunderstand?
I Don't Know.
has She Been There?
has Lisa Been There?
Yes.
once.
look, I Didn't Say Anything 'Cause I Knew How It Would Look.
so, Where Is This?
where Is This Studio?
what Do You Have?
looks Like Your Client Had A Little Love Nest.
just Found Out About It On The Victim's Computer.
you Know The Security Guard Had Priors For Selling Dope?
dope? -yeah
and A Hero Complex.
that's Fascinating. Keep On That.
there Are Three Unexplained Burglaries In The Last Six Months.

damn.
I Just Sent Alicia Off To Check It Out.
she's Got About Ten Minutes.
okay. Calling.
Alicia, Where Are You?
I'm, Uh.

Yes, And, Not To Put Too Much Pressure On You, But The Police Are On Their Way.
on Their Way Here?
Yes.
they're About Ten Minutes Behind You.
now, It's Not A Crime Scene, So You're Fine To Inspect And Take Anything You Want.
anything I Want? What Are We Saying?
I Have The Key.
look.
look, I Don't Know What You're Going To Find In There,
but Until The Police Declare It A Crime Scene,
you Can Preserve For Our Uses Anything You Find.
has Jason Said Anything?
no, But The Police Could Misunderstand Something They Find.
and Kalinda Thinks The Security Guard Is Heating Up.
here's Something She Wrote.
a Short Story.
okay, I Think We Could Use That.
there's A Blonde Hair In A Brush.
what Do I Do?
is It A Long Hair?
Yes.

no Hair In The Drain.
Thanks. Good
there's A Bra On The Towel Rack.

you All Right?
I Think So.
you Were Well Within The Law.
well"?
you Were Within The Law.
I Know It Feels Like We're Playing A Game Sometimes,
but We're Not Here To Pursue The Truth.
we're Here To Defend A Client.
and If He's Guilty? --Then, He's Guilty.
truth Is Above Our Pay Grade.
who's With Jason Now?
take A Few Hours Off.
get Some Lunch Or Something.
are You Going To Go Back To Help Cary?
Yes.

get This Off Your Mind.
she Telling Her?
Yep.

Nope.

Sonya, The Question Is Going To Be Asked.
if There's Something That You Want To Tell Me, Now Is A Good Time.
no.
well, Then.
is He Innocent?

hurting Her?
Yes.
Yes, He's Innocent Of That.
but Sleeping With Her-- He's Not Innocent Of Sleeping With Her?
I Don't Know.
is There-- Sonya, I-I Hate To Do This, But Jason Isn't Being Up-Front With Us
is There Anything That Would Lead The Police To Believe That He Is Guilty?
there Might Be.
let's Start With The Easier Questions, Shall We?
how Many Times Did You Sleep With This Prostitute, Amber Madison?
objection, Your Honor.
sex Is Not Relevant To My Client's Guilt.
Mr. Florrick Was Sentenced For Dp'ing Cases In Trade For Sexual Favors,
so Sex Is Entirely Relevant To His Guilt, Your Honor.
the Fact Of The Sex Is Relevant, Your Honor, But Not The Minutia.
then I Will Endeavor To Discern The Minutia.
you May Continue, Mr. Childs, But, Oh, So Carefully.
how Many Times Did You Sleep With Amber Madison?
well, Just To Be Precise, Mr. Childs, By "Sleeping With"" You Mean "Having Sex"?
Yes. Thank You.
and Just To Be Even More Precise, By "Having Sex," I Will Also Include Oral-Genital Contact.
18 Times.
18 Times.
and Would You Classify Any Of These As Oral-Genital Contact?
objection.
minutia, Mr. Childs.
thank You, Your Honor.
now, Were These Assignations With Amber Madison.
were They In Hotel Rooms?
Yes.
all 18 Of Them, You Were In A Hotel Room?
to The Best Of My Memory.
well, Let's See If We Can Refresh Your Memory.
did You Ever Sleep With Amber Madison At Your Home While Your Wife Was Away?
objection.
your Honor, The Defendant Has Made It Very Clear
he Believed He Paid For These Various Hotel Sessions With Amber Madison.
we Just Want To Be Clear That These Were The Only Sessions.
overruled.
so, Mr. Florrick, Did You Ever Sleep With Amber Madison At Your Home,
in Your Bed, While Your Wife Was Away?
no.
and You Know You're Under Oath?
Cammy, Let It Be Stated That I Know I'm Under Oath, And I Know That mr. Childs Is Trying To Catch Me In A Perjury Trap, And Yes, My Answer Is Still No.
thank You, Mr. Florrick.
no Problem.

I'm Not Sure I'm Going To Be Able To Get In.
do You Want Me To Tell The Police?

Oh. Does She Have A Laptop Case With Her?
Yes.

Yeah.

I Was Freaking Out.
Yes, I Know.

so, You Were At The Office All Night Until You Got A Call From Security About The Silent Alarm?
Yes. why?
you Didn't Go Home Before That?
no. Why Would I?
our Investigator Checked The Nanny Cam.
it Hadn't Been Turned On.
Oh, Well, I Must Have Forgotten That Day.
Yes.
we Thought Only Four People Could Disarm The Security Alarm-- Jason, Your Housekeeper,
the Babysitter And The Security Guard-- But We Forgot, You Could, Too.
Yes.
Why? What's Wrong?
we Found A Notice Of A Failure To Deliver A Package To Your House.
our Investigator Checked With The Company.
you Signed For A Delivery.
at 7: 30 P. M.
when You Said You Were At Work.
I-I Didn't Do It.
okay, So What Were You Doing At Home?
I Was Jealous.
I Thought Jason Was Sleeping With Her.
I Came Home To Surprise Them.
And?
he Wasn't There.
she Was There, Reading To The Girls.
I Left Embarrassed, Intent On Never Being Jealous Again.
and That Was It?
that Was It.
can I Check Your Laptop?
Why?

I've Been Subpoenaed.
to What?
your Husband's Trial.
why Would They Subpoena You?
I Know Certain Things.
well, That Doesn't Sound Good.
are You Going To Tell Me?
do You Want To Know?
I Don't Know.
Oh, God, I Don't Know Anymore.
the Truth Seemed So Simple-- Lying, Not Lying.
do You Want Him Out?
I Just Want Things To Stop Spinning.
you're Right, I Don't Want To Know.

Oh, Yes, Thank You For Getting Back To Me.
so, Lisa Pruitt Would.
I See.
right.
well, Thank You.
what?
that Was This Lawyer.
I Found It Near The Belongings Of The Victim In Rucker's Studio.
lot Of Lawyers Running Around This One.
I Don't Even Know Who We're Defending Anymore.
it's Gotten Very Confusing.
Yeah.
the Lawyer Wouldn't Tell Me If Lisa Pruitt Had Been In To See Her.
of Course Not.
that Would Be Too Easy.
but She Did Tell Me What Kind Of Work They Do.
matching Pregnant Women With Families Who Want To Adopt.
detective, I Need You To Stop Interrogating My Client And Step Out.
I Was Just Asking A Question.
you Can Finish Later.
please.
what's Wrong?
you Got Her Pregnant.
she Was At Your Little Studio.
no.
what? No
she Went To A Law Firm For Adoption.
tell Me Now Because They're Going To Find This Out During An Autopsy.
you Got Her Pregnant.
no, I Couldn't Have.
she Was At Your Studio.
Yes, I Know, But I Didn't Get Her Pregnant.
tell Me The Truth.
I Couldn't Have Gotten Her Pregnant. I Had A Vasectomy.
I Was Wondering When You Were Coming Back For That Statement.
Yeah, I'm Sorry I'm So Late.
a Couple More Questions Came Up About Lisa Pruitt.
she Ever Mention Anything To You About Being Pregnant?
who Said That?
Oh, Her Lawyer.
she Was Contacting A Law Firm About Putting A Baby Up For Adoption.
Yeah, She Told Me.
she Say Who The Father Is?
who She Babysits For-- Rucker.
Really?
Yeah.
that's Why I Think He Did It.
killed Her.
he Wanted Her To Have An Abortion, She Said No.
did She Tell You That?
he, Uh, He Didn't Want To Be Pinned Down.
you Know, This Is.
this Is All Very Helpful.
you Want Me To Say The Same Thing To The Cops?
can You Come With Me Now?
just-just Give Me A Minute.
sure.
what's Wrong?
nothing.
miss Sharma, The Defendant Fired You From The State's Attorney Office, Didn't He?
Yes, He Did.
now, In Your Own Words, Could You Explain Why He Did That?
he Said I Was Working Two Jobs.
and Were You?
Yes.
so You Were Working For Him, And You Were Working For.
you.
and What Kind Of Work Were You Doing For Me?
I Was Running Down Bimbo Eruptions.
would You Please Explain That Colloquialism?
your Honor, Again, We Object To This Line Of Questioning.
your Honor, This Is Our Last Witness.
we Ask For Some Leniency.
granted. Overruled, Mr. Golden.
what Were Bimbo Eruptions?
you Were Worried That Lawyers And Judges Were Being Co-Opted By Powerful Forces Who Used Prostitutes To Blackmail.
and When You Started This Task Force,
you Discovered That Mr. Florrick Was Involved With Amber Madison.
would You Please Explain How She Was Used To Co-Opt Mr. Florrick?
a Procurer Assigned Specific Prostitutes To Flatter And Pursue Certain Clients.
and The Clients Were Referred To By Number.
for Example, One Of The Clients Was Referred To As Client 12.
and What Did These. These Women Do?
these-these Prostitutes?
they Would Discover The Marital Status And Sexual Predilections Of These Clients.
to Use The Example Of Client 12, Um,
he Was Found To Be A Judge, A Married Judge, With Three Daughters,
and He Was Deemed To Be Interested In African-American Prostitutes,
and The Imagery Of Southern Plantation Life.
okay.
once Mr. Florrick Was Involved With Amber Madison, No Money Exchanged Hands, Isn't That Correct?
Yes, That Is Correct.
and If A Client Tried To Pay, A Procurer Would Refund The Client's Money.
like When Client 12 Tried To Pay For An Evening Out With Two African-American Women,
that Money Was Refunded.
miss Sharma, You Don't Need To Refer To A Particular Client.
just Answer My Question.
but I've Been Asked To Answer In My Own Words.
these Are My Own Words.
right, Your Words Could Be A Bit More On Point.
now, Did Mr. Florrick Have Sexual Relations With Amber Madison At His Home?
to Answer That Question, I Need To Talk About My Job,
and How Important It Was For Me To Know The Names Of All The Clients, Including Client 12.
I'm Here Under Subpoena, Mr. Childs.
if I'm Asked To Name The Names Of The Clients, I Must.
right?
um, Your Honor, Uh, Again, We Object To This, Uh, Sexual Line Of Questioning.
it's-it's Irrelevant, Just Like The Names Of These Clients Is Irrelevant.
we Respectfully Submit That This Is Beneath The Dignity Of This Court.
I Would Tend To Agree, Mr. Golden.
surely, Your Honor, There Is A Way To Elicit This Testimony, Possibly In Chambers?
not Without These Clients' Names Becoming Part Of, Uh, Public Record.
isn't That Right, Miss Sharma?
Yes, I'm Afraid So.
judge: I've Given Too Much Leeway To This Sexual Testimony, Mr. State's Attorney.
now I Must Call It To A Halt.
your Honor.
no, Sir.
it Is 4: 00 P. M.
and I Find Myself Unpersuaded By Your Arguments Of Mr. Florrick's Guilt.
I Believe This Was Nothing More Than A Sexual Witch Hunt.
but That's Not For Me To Decide.
my Job Is Merely To Determine If There Is Enough For A New Trial,
and I Believe, Mr. Florrick, There Is.
I'm Sorry, Mr. Florrick.
I'm Sorry This Has Happened To You.
and I'm Sorry I Don't Have The Power To Do More Than Order A New Trial.
but That Is Exactly What I'm Going To Do.
you, Mr. Florrick, Have Been Granted A Retrial.
Yes!
the Kid From The Dorm Was Right About The Motive.
it Was Just His Motive, Not Jason's.
she Wouldn't Get An Abortion?
they Argued, And He Killed Her.
how Did Lisa's Bra Get In Jason's Studio?
Jason Gave Her The Keys, And Her And Max Would Go There When He Wasn't Around.
at Least That's What Jason Said.
they Don't Look So Happy, Do They?
I Don't Understand Marriage.
it's A Mysterious Institution.
you Never Wanted It?
is That A Proposal?
Yes.
I've Been Watching You From Afar.
this Is Weird.
maybe You Should Watch TV.
there's Nothing On.
we Could Play 20 Questions.
does He Have A Key?
he'll Knock.
so, It'll Be Electronic Monitoring?
he'll Have To Stay Here In The Apartment?
Yes.
and We Will All Have To Adapt.
okay, Maybe We Should Just Get On With.
here We Go.
I Love You Both.
Hi.
well, let's start with soft targets.
these are reductions you can make without further layoffs or reorganization.
is one of them IT?
why don't you just tell us?
certainly.
annually, you spend $10, 000 on paper products.
cups. - You're kidding.
we would suggest moving to a self-policing hydration policy.
you spend $38, 000 on season tickets to the Chicago Cubs.
Yeah, but that's good business.
we entertain clients.
we would suggest season tickets for a less expensive sport franchise, the Chicago Red Stars.
the Professional women's soccer.
we got to cut somewhere.
the floral budget for the firm is $28, 000.
Yup. Cut somewhere.
we would suggest moving to perennials or going artificial.
we also suggest you no longer validate for parking.
the self-policing hydration policy would be presented as going green with fact sheets posted next to coolers on reducing landfills.
hello.
Oh, it's.
uh, hi. Is, uh.
uh, no.
Alicia left her phone at home.
you want to leave a message?
no.
she's with another lawyer. I'll try him. Thanks.
okay.
good morning.
Dorfman & Associates.
sorry, we don't have our phones in yet, Mr. Gardner.
let me tell Alicia.
Mr. Gardner wants you to start without him.
Thanks.
can you get us coffee?
partners offices here.
conference room there.
waiting room.
I think this is some kind of flowing thing.
what is it?
a glassed-in waterfall.
my daughter's the designer.
we have the drywall in next week.
no longer a mom-and-pop operation, huh?
last time we saw you, it was in a storefront.
not quite Stern, Lockhart, but we're on our way.
you're walking through a wall.
sorry.
we heard Stern, Lockhart was in trouble.
Tammy. - No
we've had a few layoffs, but we're steady now.
Where's all the money coming from?
insider trading.
dad's joking.
new corporate clients and a depressed retail market.
what's this?
the world's 14 highest peaks.
Annapurna, Broad Peak, Makalu.
you climbed these?
two left.
dad's hobby.
I don't know how it happened... the outdoorsman sired a homebody.
so, shall we join suits?
I'm all right if we combine lawsuits, but we really need to combine.
no stabbing in the back.
you represent the union employees, we represent the nonunion.
you have something written up?
over a handshake.
that's how I do everything.
we're junior associates.
we do everything in writing.
okay.
federal agents!
put your hands on your head now!
all right, spread out.
everything goes... computers, files, every box.
come on, Rivers.
this is harassment.
no, Eric. This is an arrest.
for what?
what did I do?
maybe you didn't hear. Hands on your head. - Ma'am.
come on. These are my lawyers.
they'll have me out in 24 hours.
not this time.
okay, okay.
what's the charge this time, Rivers?
first degree murder.
who did I kill?
Oh, come on, you lost a case.
when I lose a case, I don't go pee on your lawn.
she was innocent, and you gave her over to that scum.
Hey, that's ours.
sir, we are lawyers with Stern, Lockhart & Gardner.
we are not employees of this firm.
and we do not grant you permission to confiscate our work product.
well, given that I can't distinguish between work product in the field,
I'll segregate the files, and you can get a court order to have them returned.
well. - No
what's his name?
it's federal. I don't know the cast of characters.
what's he saying?
he telling them that we're his lawyers, and we will get him out in 24 hours.
uh, you led him to believe that?
no.
we were there on the furlough lawsuit.
the metro suit.
we decided to marry union and nonunion.
so why did Dorfman get arrested for murder?
well, Dorfman was defending a drug dealer, and there was this witness testifying for the prosecution, a Kelli Gerber Smith.
supposedly, Dorfman gave her name to his client, the drug dealer, who then had her killed.
who was the drug dealer?
Bishop's one of Dorfman's clients?
uh, he wanted us to take over his ongoing cases, just while he's being held.
he doesn't have his staff lined up yet.
he also wants us to argue for his release.
he can pay us.
it's a drug case. First things the Feds will do is freeze his assets.
he can pay us when they're unfrozen.
he seemed good.
we'll take it under review.
what was that about?
either they don't like him, or the rumors are true, Stern, Lockhart's going down.
Oh, damn it.
and I have student loans.
your husband.
Yeah, at least you have someone to fall back on.
no, no.
no, it's nothing.
I just can't find the tax returns.
and why do you need them?
you know Eli.
he needs to look into anything that can be used against us.
uh, under my bed in a box marked, I think, house files.
good. thanks
how are you doing?
well, I was almost got arrested this morning.
you.
what?
do you know an AUSA named Rivers?
very intense guy.
out to save the world. Why, what happened?
he was arresting this other lawyer.
it's a long story, but I almost got caught up in the sweep.
he's a zealot.
never look a zealot in the eyes.
how are you? - Good
I made a BLT.
I'm very proud of myself.
you know, this is the closest we've had to a normal conversation.
Yeah.
I like it.
maybe we should talk on the phone more.
speaking of which, you left your cell phone here.
will called.
he already got in touch.
okay, back to work.
back to work.
I say judges are skins this time.
hello.
Mr. Gardner, AUSA Rivers.
that's okay. We won't hold it against you.
suit up.
you phoned.
you wanted your work product back.
Yeah, but at my office.
this is a friendly County game.
you're thinking about taking the Dorfman case.
we would advise against it.
Really? And what else would you advise?
Mr. Gardner, you're having money issues.
you can't afford troubles with the federal courts.
this is like the movies.
you have to threaten me with an audit or something.
Oh, that's the IRS.
it would be a federal crime to influence the IRS.
guys, I'm being threatened over here.
can you believe it?
poor baby.
Mr. Dorfman is in trouble.
he is guilty, and his assets are frozen.
it would be a mistake to represent him.
too late.
I already am.
as of when?
as of ten seconds ago.
congratulations, Rivers.
you just won Dorfman an attorney.
this is how it works.
germs enter the political bloodstream via anonymous Twitter accounts.
these are picked up by political blogs that.
I'm going to drop that metaphor.
Why? No...
keep going. See where it takes you.
there's an anonymous Twitter account out there... Upriser7.
it's saying things about you and Alicia.
well, isn't that, uh, to be expected?
some of them are true.
like what?
saint Alicia, as she's called behind her back, is despised "because of her close connection to boss, Will.
widely hated, she's given all best cases.
are we saying that's true?
Alicia and Peter sleep in separate rooms.
he is in maids quarters.
she's in the master.
not even a real marriage.
so, the danger is that it'll be picked by a political blog, and then move into the mainstream.
I mean, I can reduce the damage by flooding the zone with bogus tweets that say the opposite.
any search engine will be overwhelmed by both.
wait a minute.
who knew that we are in separate rooms?
there's also stuff about Mrs. Florrick's work, her competition for a job, and her connection with her boss.
what did that one say?
you don't want to read it.
that she's sleeping with him.
all right.
let's find out who's sending these tweets.
thank you, Mr. Gardner.
my father is just so thankful.
no problem.
we'll see what we can do.
not my playground.
all rise.
Mr. Rivers, what do we have today?
several motions on Eric Dorfman, Your Honor.
and I'm sorry to hear about your accident.
thank you. I got your card.
I imagine you're seeking detention pending trial?
Yes, Your Honor.
Mr. Dorfman, in our opinion, released a witness list to a killer, and given that there will be vulnerable witnesses in this case, we ask for pretrial detention.
AUSA Rivers failed to convict LeMond Bishop on RICO charges and is now going after his lawyer as retribution.
in your opinion?
excuse me?
in your opinion?
Yes, in my opinion.
he's trying to subvert the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
Mr. Gardner is prone to hyperbole, Your Honor.
Kelli Gerber Smith offered to testify against one of the most dangerous kingpins in this country, and in our opinion, was brutally tortured and murdered for her troubles.
your Honor, the prosecution's evidence is thin at best.
generic carpet fibers found on the body, access to a witness list.
that hardly makes Eric Dorfman suspect number one.
in your opinion.
Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry.
I thought it was obvious, when I speak, it's my opinion, and when he speaks, it's his.
Oh, boy.
mister.
Gardner, Your Honor.
it is equally obvious that I'm a judge, and yet you continually refer to me as "Your Honor."
all I ask is that you do the same with your opinion, and remind yourself and the court that it is in fact your opinion.
your Honor, if I could return to the facts.
Mr. Dorfman was one of four people to hold the witness list that was sealed under a court order.
there were carpet fibers found on the tarp covering Ms. Smith's body that came directly from Mr. Dorfman's law firm.
and in our opinion, he was the only one with anything to gain if her name got out.
this is a vindictive prosecution and should be treated as such.
in my opinion.
the court disagrees, Mr. Gardner, and orders pretrial detention.
I'll see you both back here on Wednesday at 9: 00 a.m. for pretrial motions.
it's their courtyard, you play by their rules.
they're so cocky.
it's just another courtroom, and they treat it like St. Peter's.
didn't we agree to not take this?
no, we agreed to cut the flowers and paper cups.
the least I can do is take the cases I want.
you sure this isn't pride?
of course, it's pride.
what's wrong with pride?
pride built the pyramids.
and Watergate.
God, those do look fake.
those are the real ones.
okay, four people had access to that witness list.
find out who they were, where it went.
rivers, the court clerk, Dorfman, the judge.
good.
now, did they or anyone around them leak it?
also let's look at the prosecution's assumptions: the witness in this original case.
are we sure she was even actually murdered due to the case?
and if she was, did the killers really need the witness list to know she was going to testify?
how do we find that out?
go to Bishop.
you want to go ask a drug kingpin whether he really needed a witness list to kill somebody?
well, there's probably a better way to put it.
but in theory, he wants his lawyer out, too, and if he could help steer us towards evidence that would exonerate Dorfman, that'd be good.
you up for it?
sure.
uh, excuse me.
Mr. Bishop?
so you're my lawyer's lawyer?
actually, she is.
arms out, ladies.
it's all right.
the lawyers are on our side.
didn't you hear, Tony?
when we were picking sides, they got the cops; we got the lawyers.
beautiful horses.
they're not mine.
rich people need places to board them.
one of your legit businesses?
Hey, I'm all legit these days.
isn't that right?
it is.
so you wanted help with Dorfman?
good.
I like him.
did he show you his rock collection?
I think he just picked those rocks up off the street.
guy has these rocks from the top peaks from around the world.
Everest?
no, not that one yet.
mountain climbing never made much sense to me.
bunch of idiots who just need something to do.
but he's a good lawyer.
and lucky.
we didn't even have to go to trial with that witness dying.
you mean being murdered.
Mr. Dorfman has been accused of leaking the witness's identity, allowing you to murder her.
well, as I'm sure you're aware, he didn't do that because I didn't do that.
right.
but if you could steer us in the direction of what really happened, I think that could help Mr. Dorfman.
"what really happened"?
is there some evidence that points to the murder happening for other reasons?
reasons that didn't require the witness list.
I own a chain of six sporting good stores, four restaurants, ten dry cleaners.
I am a businessman.
so I don't want you making the same mistake as the government, thinking that, because of the color of my skin, I sell drugs.
because that would be racism, wouldn't it?
well, this is an exciting day.
you wanted to come.
so.
here's the thing.
I won't say much, I won't answer questions, but Bishop likes Mr. Dorfman, thinks he got a raw deal.
we do, too.
rivers found the black SUV that carried this dead witness.
unfortunately, this SUV was never meant to be discovered, so it may not be as clean as one would hope.
was Dorfman ever in this SUV?
again, if there is any attempt to subpoena or question myself or Mr. Bishop, we will deny this.
but Rivers found the SUV two weeks ago, right after the murder, and he's kept it under wraps ever since.
Why?
keep it out of your hands.
surprise you at trial.
we would advise you to fight its inclusion.
talk about a pact with the devil.
we're taking trial advice from killers.
objection, Your Honor.
this SUV was kept from us intentionally.
the only reason the court knows about it at all is because we brought it up.
it should be thrown out.
I'll give you some leeway, Rivers.
go ahead.
in addition, Your Honor, we discovered an impression made on the console from a hastily written note... "Gerbre."
this of course was the middle name of the victim, and as you can see the last two letters were inverted.
this clearly matches the accidental inversion made on the witness list.
we submit it into evidence.
Objection!
again, Your Honor, this evidence was intentionally withheld from us, summarily removed from all exhibit lists, and should be excluded.
in your opinion.
Yes, in my opinion.
while Mr. Gardner and his white-shoe firm may have the resources to process evidence expeditiously, in our opinion, Your Honor, the federal government does not.
not according to your own lab's time stamp.
in my opinion, Mr. Rivers was holding on to this key discovery evidence for weeks,
your Honor, lying to this court about its very existence.
Mr. Gardner is working with old information, in our opinion.
I would submit this revision of the evidence room stamp.
objection.
I'll accept.
continue, Rivers. - Thank you.
I would like to name. - Excuse me, Your Honor, I objected.
Yes, I know, Mr. Gardner, and I accepted Mr. Rivers' evidence.
Yes, but you failed to rule.
my ruling is implicit, Mr. Gardner.
now, sit down.
no, it isn't, Your Honor.
and I will sit down when you rule.
would you like to be held in contempt, Mr. Gardner?
no, I would not, Your Honor, but I would like a ruling on my objection.
you are trying my patience.
I understand that, Your Honor, but we both know if you don't use the proper form of "sustained or "overruled," the matter can't later be appealed.
and I was surprised in reviewing your past court cases, how often you encouraged lawyers to move on without actually ruling, therefore avoided having your nonrulings overturned on appeal.
in my opinion.
Mr. Gardner, I have never been quite so offended in all my years on the bench.
I understand that, Your Honor, but I still want a ruling.
a ruling I can appeal.
your Honor, this evidence is necessary for our prosecution.
a conviction is necessary for your prosecution.
that doesn't make it a worthy argument.
one hour for lunch.
your Honor.
I said, one hour for lunch.
what the hell was that?
do you have a map? - Do I have a what?
a map so I can show you where you live.
that, my friend, was a Chicago defense.
get used to it.
even if the judge kicks the SUV, which given my courtroom performance, isn't all that likely.
although fun.
we still need to undercut the carpet fibers from Dorfman's office.
that's the only thing that ties him to the body.
Dorfman's carpet is US Taupe Dream.
it's one of the most common in the country.
good.
anything on the witness list?
two other prosecutors in Rivers' office had access to it.
they were listed on the initial filing before Rivers took over the case.
I'm data-mining them now to find any connection with Bishop's crew.
all right, Cary, you stay on the carpet.
and, Kalinda, you stay on the data-mining.
and,
I'll go back to my office.
Yes, I do have a home.
good.
maybe you should try using it.
interesting case?
Yes.
may I help you, Mr. Gold?
saint Alicia is not just sleeping with her boss, she is also using him to get promoted.
Upriser7... a tweet.
about, uh, two hours ago.
about me?
Yes.
and Peter.
but mostly you.
at first, I thought it was intended to derail Peter's campaign, but then I realized, no.
it's about you.
we're just collateral damage.
this is on the Internet?
Yes.
and Ben Smith just linked to it as part of a remainder item, so it may get wider play.
please excuse the melodrama, but do you think there's anybody here who's got it out for you?
young guy, 12: 00?
but would he know that you and Peter are in separate rooms?
that's in here?
even mentions the name of the moving company that put the bed in.
saint Alicia" doesn't sound like him.
that's the thing about the Internet.
nobody sounds like they seem.
Hi.
want to make a call, Mrs. Florrick?
no, um, I just.
it's.
you know the movers who came out last week to put in the bed?
your apartment? Yes
is there any way Cary could've heard about that?
heard the movers put in another bed?
Yes.
no.
no, I don't mean on purpose.
I'm discreet, Mrs. Florrick.
Yes, of course.
it's not. it's just, you know, the Bluetooth.
sometimes you can be near someone.
never mind.
forget it.
Yes, hello.
um, can you stop Mr. Gold from leaving?
I think he left.
my mistake.
uh, never mind.
what's up?
can you come into my office?
certainly, ma'am.
can you look inside that bag?
where did that come from?
I have no idea.
$200, 000 and the vague whiff of marijuana.
what did you say to him?
nothing. We just asked about the murder.
what's up?
and why does it smell like a frat house in here?
our best guess.
I'll make the call.
it's your retainer.
I didn't know you were hiring.
I'm not.
I need new lawyers.
don't you already have representation?
in jail.
I need someone now.
business is piling up.
this is a bit unorthodox.
we represent your current lawyer.
Yes.
my experience is lawyers are good at making the unorthodox orthodox.
why us?
one of my aides saw him in court.
I was off-script.
nice touch bringing the black guy.
for your information, I'm an equity partner.
where you from?
none of your business.
I have a corporation, a large one, with a lot of employees.
and they sometimes get into trouble.
I need a firm to look after their interests and mine.
help me make the best financial and legal decisions.
I pay well.
I pay on time.
and I help those who help me.
you have a DUI involving the Baja Fund CEO.
I could tell you things that would help you with the arresting officer.
I met your husband once.
taller than I expected.
Yes, he is tall.
electronic monitoring's a bitch, isn't it?
they don't validate.
how can they not validate?
they're going to argue about this, then they're going to say "yes.
maybe.
no "maybe"" Money makes things predictable," so here's your signing bonus: This Rivers, I have something.
it isn't the same as Sheffrin-Marks.
you don't even believe that.
how's it different?
you know how many kids died from their asthma medicine?
Oh, my God, the sophistry here is just blinding.
Sheffrin-Marks has white employees in suits.
Bishop's crew has African-American men.
don't try to sell this on the back of racism!
Sheffrin-Marks didn't set out to murder anyone.
Shane Marx, Paul Din, Johnathan Graham, all murderers.
accused murderers.
now who's the sophist?
we're not in a court of law, Diane.
it's just you and me.
we represent murderers.
we get them off.
no.
we keep the courts honest.
and why shouldn't the courts be kept honest about Bishop?
everybody deserves representation.
does that stop suddenly when it comes to.
a criminal organization whose sole purpose is to sell drugs and to murder to control territory?
sure.
put it any way you want, it's still a true statement.
we're doing this for the money.
of course we are.
we're not a charity.
we do this or we lay off half of Acquisitions.
that's ten lawyers and ten families.
not to mention your season tickets.
I'm sorry.
he gave a parting piece of information about Rivers.
what?
rivers was sleeping with Kelli Gerber Smith, the murdered witness.
objection, Your Honor.
overruled.
how's that, Mr. Gardner?
do you approve of that?
I do.
thank you, Your Honor.
so, if there are no more pretrial motions maybe we can move this along.
actually, the defense requests that AUSA Rivers be disqualified as prosecution's representative.
on what grounds?
that's my question, Mr. Rivers.
Yes, Your Honor.
on what grounds, Mr. Gardner?
your Honor, this is a signed affidavit from the clerk at the Lake Avenue Motel saying that Mr. Rivers spent the night with Kelli Gerber Smith on nine occasions.
relevance, Your Honor?
your Honor, do I even need to respond?
is this true, Counselor?
uh, Your Honor.
answer the question, Mr. Rivers.
Yes.
but I assure Your Honor that it will in no way affect my ability to prosecute this case.
motion denied, Mr. Gardner.
however, I am reconsidering the SUV.
how did you find that out?
how?
inside source.
too bad it didn't disqualify Rivers.
we didn't want it to.
it undercut the judge's trust in Rivers and got her to kick the SUV.
do you have a second?
sure. What's up?
are you tweeting about me?
am I tweeting about you?
are you Upriser7?
what are you talking about?
someone's gossiping online about me.
and you thought it was me?
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, it's good to be working with you, too.
Hello?
Eli: In here, hon.
how was work?
Where's... - In the shower.
kids are in bed. I let them watch a little TV.
have you ever seen When a Stranger Calls?
the movie?
a long time ago.
we just traced the IP address for the last anonymous tweet.
And?
it's coming from inside the house.
no, just a bit of an emergency.
rivers found another way to get the SUV in.
through the GPS.
so I'll need you to come in. sorry
no, it's all right.
um, I'll probably be half an hour.
great. Thanks.
no problem.
is that Will? - Yes
I have to go back in.
so what do you think?
I don't know.
maybe one of them is angry.
either about me running again or.
or me at work.
do you really think it's possible that our children would do that?
it's crazy, Peter.
maybe someone was using our Wi-Fi without us knowing?
Eli's checking it.
but we still have to talk to them.
I'll do it.
tomorrow.
all-nighter?
no, just a few more hours.
I found condoms in your bedside table.
I was looking for your letter opener.
I thought maybe they belonged to Zach.
you know, you found them in his room.
but then I thought, you wouldn't take them.
you'd have a sensible conversation with him about responsibility.
so then, I thought they were yours.
but that didn't make sense because you have an IUD.
I had it removed.
Oh, really?
so condoms do make sense?
they do.
for who?
check it, Peter.
I said I was looking for your letter opener.
I have other drawers, too.
did you check these ones?
I said that I was looking.
how about over here? Did you check this drawer?
what is it you need to hear from me?
I will never touch another woman again.
what do you want, a prize, Peter?
it seems to be the minimum prerequisite.
for both of us.
then trust me.
then don't go to work tonight.
trust me.
but the GPS isn't the same as the SUV in our opinion.
it's contained in the SUV in my opinion.
but the data is separate and tracked through satellite imaging.
which is only accessed through the SUV, which was thrown out!
your Honor, the GPS shows this SUV drove right from Mr. Dorfman's office to the site where the body was dumped on the night of the murder.
you have no proof my client was in the SUV or at his office at those times!
this isn't about Mr. Dorfman pulling the trigger.
we don't need to prove that, Your Honor, in our opinion.
this is about whether or not he was complicit in the witness' death.
and the inference is that. - Was the GPS factory installed?
what?
I don't know.
how is that relevant, Mr. Gardner?
if the GPS was installed at the factory, it should be considered part of the automobile regardless of whether or not the tracking information was pulled from satellite technology.
the GPS was manufactured by Botheon, Incorporated, Your Honor.
not General Motors.
a separate corporate entity that uses separate satellites that gather information.
therefore, we should be able to introduce this information into evidence.
overruled, Mr. Gardner.
the GPS data is allowed into evidence.
we're still looking for ways to undercut the GPS, but we need to know: Were you at your law office that night?
the night of the murder?
Yes.
but you didn't talk to or see any of the Bishop crew?
no.
then why were they at your office?
because this GPS has them at your office.
I don't know.
they could've been parked there for all we know.
all "we" know? Who's we? - We.
dad and me.
you were there?
Yes.
okay, we'll try to do what we can to undercut the GPS.
Thanks.
Mrs. Florrick.
could you stay a minute?
no, Tammy. We're fine.
your daughter had access to the witness list and she leaked it to Bishop.
Why?
to win the case?
I had a struggling firm.
she wanted to show Bishop we could handle his business.
and you, you knew?
well, then that's your defense.
no.
you even think of using her to free me, and I'll confess.
she's not my client.
I am your client and I will confess.
Eric, this.
I don't think you understand.
with that information, Bishop will kill her.
no.
he knows if he moves against her, I'll tell Rivers everything.
I've got some files socked away, and attorney-client privilege be damned.
then what are you going to do?
because if I found out your daughter leaked the witness list, Rivers can't be far behind.
will you take a message to Bishop for me?
it's not a big deal.
I won't have a talk.
no scolding, no mothering, just.
I want to know.
well, I don't tweet.
y-you guys think that.
mom, this is stupid.
Alicia: Don't say "stupid.
there were two IP addresses used: the Internet at your school and here.
I can't believe this.
this is like a police state.
don't be melodramatic.
I'm asking you a question.
no, you're not.
you're not saying "no."
grace, don't.
you didn't do this?
you didn't write these things? - Mam
what?
let's at least pretend we know what happened here the last six months.
that was different.
we didn't tell you about the pictures, because they were trying to hurt you.
it was a lie, Zach.
and not one.
it was over and over again.
but a lie like lying about having Jews in your basement.
you know, like, with the Nazis.
let's trust each other again.
my defenses are down.
let's go.
just tell me.
I told you.
he did it.
that's the way he and Becca talk all the time.
uh, not really how I wanted it to, but.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
she's still in class.
will you excuse us, ladies?
it's okay.
have you got a problem?
that depends, Upriser7?
Oh, so what are you, like, the Internet police?
no, just an interested bystander who wants to protect his six-figure income.
so, you and Zach talk a lot.
he talks a lot about his parents, is that it?
Oh, no.
have I been a bad girl?
no, dear Becca, because that would only make you want to do it again.
you know what you've been?
gum on the bottom of my shoe.
spoiled little brat who will get pregnant at 17, have an abortion at 18 and meet some sweaty frat boy over spring break, and work as a dental hygienist until the day you die.
and you.
you're a perv.
you better get your story straight, perv.
Oh, Mr. Gold. I'm sorry.
don't worry, officer.
just a daughter of a friend of mine.
she's all right now.
aren't you, Becca?
I'm good.
see, I have a lot of friends, I'm sure you do, too, but only difference is, my friends are not in homeroom.
so I want you to listen to me.
stop tweeting.
if you tweet, I will know you tweet and I will.
have you seen Drag Me to Hell?
it will be just like that.
do you understand?
I want to hear the words.
I understand.
good.
and enjoy high school.
it really is the best time of your life.
this way, gentlemen.
my name is Tony Gurstelle, and I am guilty of the murder of Kelli Gerber.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
he's surrendering himself freely!
get out of my way!
I acted alone and with no consultation from anybody else.
I had no access to the witness list or any other information other than my own.
I don't have anything further to add.
what kind of deal did you make?
you got your murderer.
come on, what kind of deal did you make with Bishop?
do you expect an answer?
Really?
what kind of deals do you make every day?
with drug dealers, killers?
I am in pursuit of the good.
you're in pursuit of your own sanctity.
take your suspect.
he killed your girlfriend.
you won.
you pay your rent, you go to your restaurants, but you still wake up with fleas.
I'm firing you.
no reflection on your work.
I just feel more comfortable with Dorfman.
and keeping the evidence he has on you secret?
well, that doesn't hurt.
good work on his defense, by the way.
will: Good work on your deal.
Dorfman keeps everything he knows under wraps and you turn over the murderer.
well, we only ended up there because of your defense.
look, we can work with Dorfman and share your business.
no, thanks.
I need an up-and-comer.
someone who's hungry.
you don't think we're hungry?
not like Dorfman.
guy's a mountain climber.
sorry it didn't work out.
so, I'm pitching our firm to this drug dealer.
I'm telling him we'll validate for parking again.
they don't teach you that at law school.
and he said, no.
he said he looked at our financials and he thinks we have a year left.
so what are we going to do?
I don't know.
lay off Acquisitions?
or split up.
do you want that?
it's an option.
I take my people, you take yours.
or we could shop for another drug dealer.
Hey, they're the only ones making money these days.
or find a third partner.
how does that work?
find a replacement for Stern.
bring him in as equal partner.
somebody with a client list, some equity.
you're okay with giving up a third?
of what, a sinking ship?
sure.
we'll kill each other if we don't find a referee.
a third partner?
someone neutral, someone we both agree on?
an optimism fills the void.
I think that's alcohol.
just as good.
you sure?
Yeah.
come on. Let's go before I change my mind.
just wait.
come on. Let's go.
just one second.
I need to get something of mine.
let's just drop this. Okay?
he told me to drop it.
anything said in voicemail doesn't count.
no. You know what?
I'm not just dropping this. You want to know my plan?
my plan is I love you. Okay?
if none of this makes sense to you, just ignore it.
delete voice mail?
I need something on a Dr. Randall Booth.
we need to knee-cap him.
anything you want, Mr. Gardner.
hello.
Hey, Alderman. It's me. I'm
Hey, what is that? You having a party?
Yeah. My, uh, daughter's preschool graduation.
is this, um... this is about the cash?
Yeah, yeah. The $50, 000.
so, what? Do they have preschool graduations these days?
preschool, grade school, Sunday school;
we celebrate every second of a kid's life these days.
Yeah, Lindsey wants to have a kid, but I don't know.
2518 minimization.
a "2518 minimization" is a 30-second break in the recording.
required by law for when a phone conversation turns personal.
you're probably wondering why we're asking you to indict only one of these men today.
the simple reason is: this man is dead.
Royce Crombie was a bundler.
a man who solicited money for politicians.
when Mr. Crombie found out that this grand jury had been impaneled, he took his own life.
so we are asking you to focus on this man today.
now, I know many of you may recognize him.
detroit Pistons, 2000?
but I still need you to judge him purely as a politician.
a corrupt politician.
dang, man.
I thought you were supposed to distract me. - This is distracting you.
what, distracting me with fouls?
you got to protect those knees, old man. For Marion.
looking good.
who's that? - Tammy.
now, now.
so, you really were done, huh?
moved on from your schoolyard crush.
how'd you meet her?
she's an old friend.
I told her to come down here to watch me whip the ass of the great Matthew Wade.
here we go.
how'd we do? - Nothing yet.
we're hearing they may come back tomorrow.
tomorrow? You're kidding.
no. Kalinda thinks she can find out more when the clerk comes out.
okay. Keep me in the loop.
how is he?
he's better than I'd be. - You're a good friend, hanging with him.
no, in Chicago you need your friends three times:
at your wedding, your wake, and your first indictment.
Blake's here. Just arrived. - Good. Have him help Kalinda.
yeah... Actually, I don't know how much those two help each other.
look, as long as they don't kill each other, the competition's good for the firm.
Dr. Booth is, uh, still in the hospital.
sorry. That's the witness that you put in a coma.
Oh! Yeah. Yeah, what... when did I do that, again?
when you broke into his office to find evidence for our anti-depressant case and the good doctor surprised you?
right. Right. That must've slipped my mind.
cause I-I thought I broke into his office,
I found the evidence, I accidentally left the door open, and then some unknown assailant beat him up.
sure. When the police question you stick to that.
see you.
clerk just left the room. Kalinda's on him.
good. We'll sit tight.
nice guy.
I saw him at UCLA in '97. Played like a demon.
sorry, hon. Looks like I won't know for another day.
so did he do it? - Do what?
whatever they're charging him with.
he's a black Muslim alderman in the city's poorest ward.
and he was wiretapped saying I don't know what.
my guess is it doesn't matter if he did it.
music's off and he's the one without a chair.
you're not interested in any of this, are you?
I'm sorry, were you talking?
I have a surprise for you tomorrow at work.
sounds dirty. What is it?
let me explain this whole idea of "a surprise.
if you fall in love with me, I'm out of here.
I know. - I'm just warning you.
I know.
will! Call waiting.
the problem isn't corruption; the problem is terrorism.
what? - They say he took extremist money.
30 years to life.
I need you to take this.
I heard. It's just federal overreach.
I know, but they may have stumbled onto something they can win
anti-muslim bias.
wiretaps are hard. Juries love them.
I know. That's why I need you to take this.
get it kicked in pretrial motions.
he will lose in front of a jury.
and if I advise him to cop a plea?
it's your call.
okay, very simply:
the government was embarrassed by the Blagojevich fiasco, and they're gunning for any Chicago politician they can find.
will has nothing to do with this.
he has asked me to lead because his friendship with Wade is a hindrance.
so here's our plan. Get the terrorism charge booted.
we do that, we get a 30-year sentence down to six months and change.
two fronts: the money.
I'm going through Royce Crombie's finances.
he bundled for a lot of candidates.
I'm trying to trace the cash.
good. Take Blake. And the second front, the wiretaps.
already worked out discovery with the Feds.
the usual rules. We go to them, work in their house.
how many hours of tapes? - 135.
how many people do you need?
Michael, Howard, Alan, Alicia. Should take a week.
good. There's something in those tapes the government believes makes their terrorism case.
is it an inaudible utterance? Is it guesswork?
find it. Neutralize it. When do you go?
as soon as this meeting is over. - Good. It's over.
no pens, no papers, no cells.
the tapes won't be marked, the calls won't be labeled.
they make our jobs hard because we are out to destroy them.
you brought jackets. Good.
the Feds keep the room temperatures freezing.
it's petty harassment, but don't complain.
don't bitch. Just work harder.
don't say anything to anyone but me.
don't forget. You find anything, knock on my door.
2/22/10, 11: 38 a. m.
Hello? - Wade, it's me. You phoned?
uh, yeah.
you sound busy.
I thought we could talk.
so, what? Are we in need of advice or consultation?
a bit of both.
when does the meter start running, Eli?
when does the meter start running, Eli?
for a friend, when we both agree.
I got a meeting with Florrick in ten, so what do you need?
login submit see all
that's just pitiful. 57 friends.
the only thing worse than having a fake profile is having nobody visit it.
we just need to update it.
he needs to comment more on his dad's race.
no. He needs to comment more on his opponent's race.
what? We have Glenn Childs, Jr. say something racist about his dad's African-American opponent.
it wouldn't be us saying it. It'd be him.
Yeah, but it'll be us having him say it.
and besides, it'll just make Wendy look sympathetic.
so, what then? We need something viral.
Oh, my God. Dad.
dad, look! It's a double rainbow!
dad, get out of your sleeping bag.
tell me, Dad. What does it mean?
it means the city is safe.
so, why do you need the blinds closed, again?
for your surprise.
it's not my birthday.
you see the puppy? - I do.
the puppy's smiling. - I can see.
no...
where? - 50-yard line.
how? - Magic.
I got to admit, this is really turning me on.
I knew it would.
how much time do we have?
20 minutes.
we're not alone.
sorry. I... - That's okay.
something on the wiretaps. - What is it?
someone who's on them. Eli Gold.
well, I guess that would make sense.
Wade would be phoning a political operative like Eli.
well, that's what I thought at first, too.
but the wiretaps are on Eli's phone.
you think the Feds are going after him? - Six degrees of wiretap.
the Feds go from Crombie to Wade, Wade to Eli, then Eli to...
uh, thank you, Alicia.
Eli is a top client, but I think you can't say anything to him.
I know it'll be difficult, but you're covered by the same confidentiality.
do you want off the wiretap detail?
no. Unless you want me off.
no. You're doing a good job.
so anything on the terrorism charge?
well, we now know why the grand jury indicted.
Wade comes right out and says it.
is the $50, 000 political payoff from Islamic extremists?
he actually says "Islamic extremists"? - Wade says he was joking.
Yes, but it doesn't sound good.
all right, stay on it. Thank you, Alicia.
your client killed a man.
and in Chicago, at least today, that's illegal.
and I'm not gonna cut any corners with you, so get it to me by 5: 00.
you sound tough.
Yeah, I'm in a bad mood. What do you need?
the Crombie suicide-- I need his movements the last week.
Oh, yeah, the bundler? Shouldn't you be in federal court?
I thought Cook County probably did its own investigation.
come with me. - No, you can just send it over.
Kalinda, come with me.
okay.
wow, you really are in a bad mood. What's up?
Dr. Randall Booth. Do you know who that is?
I do.
thank you for not lying to me.
well, thank you for having so much faith in me.
he was beaten within an inch of his life after surprising a burglar ransacking his office.
strangely enough, your firm won a case the next day that benefited from that assault.
are you making an accusation?
no.
I saw the assault report, and your fingerprints were found at the scene.
what? - Now, I told the investigators what I thought.
I thought you probably went to the doctor's office earlier in the day to question him, and that's how your fingerprints ended up there.
and the police-- they wanted to question you.
I told them this sort of assault was unlike you and suggested they look elsewhere.
Thanks.
but if I were you, Kalinda,
I would try and figure out how my fingerprints ended up at the scene.
what did the assailant use?
to beat the doctor? - Yeah.
never recovered, but the police think it was a baseball bat.
I was elected by a five-point margin.
in Ward 53. I could get a serial killer elected in Ward 53.
okay, I got to go. Um...
I'll help if I can, but my hands are full with Florrick.
4/13/10, 11: 16 a. m.
this is Gold. - Yeah, Dad, it's me.
Yeah, your mom said you'd phone. - Did she tell you?
she told me a strange story about you wanting to move to Israel and live on a kibbutz.
it's not strange, Dad. I'm 18. I want to go.
Yeah, of course, you want to go, but you're...
2518 minimization-- 11: 17 a. m.
30-second break. Tap resumed.
Hey, Alderman Wade. Hoping you could help us with that new detox center down on...
this is Gwen Abernathy, from the Central City No Kill Shelter.
I have a bit of a problem... - ...trying to schedule an appointment to come talk to the high school...
no, no, don't tell Peter.
why not? It's a detail; he hates details. I'll ask Alicia.
what's up with you, Eli?
everything you do, you shoot past the candidate's wife?!
no, I don't. - Yeah, you do.
okay, I do. She's smart. She's not like
uh, what was that one in 2008?
Oh, my God, Jenny.
Yeah.
so does she know everything you're up to?
Alicia? Uh, no.
you gonna tell her?
I don't know, um...
she's burdened with a-- what do you call that thing? A conscience.
Oh, yeah, that.
Yeah, that.
what's up, Martin? I'm kind of busy.
what did we say? What the hell did we say?!
is this about the debates?
no, Glenn Childs cannot stand on a soap box.
you know what this is about.
you're right, but remind me.
we said hands off families.
Florrick has two kids. My client has two kids.
they were off-limits. - They are off-limits.
then what am I looking at?
tell me. I need guidance.
a fake Web profile.
a "double rainbow" video of someone faking Glenn, Jr.'s voice.
sounds sweet.
it has Childs and his son in the same sleeping bag together.
google "Double rainbow" and "Glenn Childs, Jr.
doesn't sound like us, Martin. Have you checked out Wendy?
Oh, come on. Eli, that only works so many times.
you know, we have stuff we can use, too.
stuff on Zach and Grace.
that's right, I know their names.
Oh, my God, it's so beautiful!
don't do anything you'd regret, Martin.
or what? My only regret is thinking you'd stick to your word.
you want to make this about families, this is now about families.
Oh, Dad, Dad, get out of your sleeping bag...
I don't know, Eli. But it's not us.
let me comfort you, son.
Hey, Alderman. Got a moment?
Yeah. Why wouldn't I? It's only 5: 00 a. m.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I wake you?
how much, Royce? - $30, 000.
so are we talking Islamic extremists here?
so are we talking Islamic extremists here?
it was a joke. They were laughing. I got the original.
4/23/10. 5:33 a. m.
that's my call-waiting.
good. I'll see you in court.
hello.
Hey, Alicia, we've got a bit of a problem.
Mr. Gold-- Eli, how are you?
good. Why?
no reason.
okay. So I got a call from the Childs campaign about something on the Internet that we did not approve.
Eli, um, why don't we do this in person?
in p...? It'll only take a second.
um, you know what, we can do it after court.
um, we'll do it in person...
what's going on? - We'll talk later.
all rise. The Honorable Judge Lessner presiding.
and we have pretrial motions on People versus Alderman Matthew Wade, is that correct?
Yes, Your Honor. - Oh, hell.
ms. Lockhart, do you have a motion?
Diane, psst. Diane, Diane.
uh, one moment, Your Honor.
just keep saying "in my opinion" before everything. - Keep what?
I've argued in front of this judge before. Just do it.
ms. Lockhart? - Um, yes, Your Honor, I,um...
we believe the government has padded its charge against my client with a ridiculous terrorism count...
in my opinion.
and we ask for summary dismissal of this charge.
the government has ample reason to charge Mr. Wade, Your Honor.
in the submitted wiretaps, he had mentioned on several occasions receiving money from Muslim extremists.
in your opinion?
excuse me, Your Honor?
in your opinion, you have ample reason?
uh, yes, in my opinion.
the unfortunate thing is, Your Honor, the government has attempted to bury the fact that this was merely a joke-- in my opinion.
a joke taken deathly seriously by their client.
I'm sorry, was that in your opinion?
ms. Vashey, was it?
Yes, Your Honor. In my opinion.
the only problem is that, in an earlier taped conversation between Mr. Wade and Royce Crombie, the two men discussed Mr. Wade's faith and joked that the only people who would contribute money to him were Islamic extremists.
this then became their running gag.
a running gag unaccompanied by laughter, Your Honor.
Yes, as tends to happen in human conversation.
you'll find, at these moments in the wiretaps,
Mr. Wade and Crombie joked with laughter-- about Muslim extremists.
in my opinion.
it does seem a little odd, Ms. Vashey, that someone who was an actual Muslim extremist would refer to associates as "Muslim extremists.
do you have anything else?
ms. Vashey, anything?
your Honor, immediately after Mr. Wade received $50, 000 from an Islamic extremist contributor, he vetoed the city council's decision and insisted that the Al-Mirad mosque be built...
Oh, come on.
this he did over the objections of his community and the advice of his campaign manager
in my opinion.
this is a moving target of an indictment, Your Honor.
in my opinion, it should be rejected.
the evidence is quite clear.
in my opinion.
then supply it to the defense for review, and I will hear arguments on this charge in four days time.
they're going to get me, no matter what.
alderman Wade did, in fact, maneuver the city council to approve the Al-Mirad mosque on 86th.
and he explained why.
he did. It was a blighted neighborhood, and the building that was razed was a squatter " meth house.
it's also true that the neighborhood has revived since, so one could argue that Wade made the right decision.
But? - He received a payment from Crombie
a $50, 000 contribution
a day before he reversed himself on the mosque.
it's a bad fact.
Yep. Anything good?
well, there's, um...something odd.
um, the bundler, Crombie
at the time of this $50, 000 contribution, he made six visits in one week to the same gas station at Garfield Park.
okay, I don't understand.
this gas station is ten miles away from him.
you think it was a meeting place for one of these Islamic contributors?
or a non-Islamic one.
I will... I will find out.
and we're still on the wire taps. Halfway through.
good. Then let's go.
everything all right?
Yeah. It will be soon.
so what'd you do with my bat?
I took it because I didn't want you to destroy my next rental car.
right. So where is it?
you know what I want, Kalinda? A truce.
because I really think that we got off on the wrong foot.
this won't end well.
well, that's intimidating.
the 15 boxes we've been through haven't yielded anything bullet-proof, so we need to focus on repeated patterns of conversa...
Eli. How are you?
me? Good. Why? What's wrong?
nothing. I was just asking.
there is a tape online which we had nothing to do with making fun of Glenn Childs's son.
and I just had an angry call from the Childs campaign that they plan to return the favor.
return? What do you mean?
I don't know. But I wanted to prepare you.
hold on.
Hello?
yeah? Well, stop him!
what do you want me to do? !
tough campaign?
we get the Pastor Isaiah endorsement right at the moment when it means nothing because he loses his church.
so, yeah. I guess.
you're doing everything by the book, aren't you?
Hello?
so, uh, Lemond Bishop owns this place, right?
I recognize you from his crew.
I did some work for Mr. Bishop last year.
okay, I know he's legit now. No more drugs.
here's your change.
so, uh... if Mr. Bishop happens to come in here, will you tell him that Kalinda dropped by, wanted to talk to him about Alderman Wade?
he's not the owner, lady.
I'm just across the street. Parked right there.
I don't think you're hearing me. He's not the owner.
you have a nice day.
stop it. - You still mad at me?
I'm just studying, see? This is called studying.
well, I'm bored.
well, you need to work on that, don't you?
how much would it cost?
ten dollars.
my mom would kill me.
not if it was just one sweet little stud. Right there.
who do you think you are, Becca?
I think you just answered your question, didn't you?
you think what you did is funny?
what are you talking about? What did I do?
the fake page you made about me. - What fake page?
I know you did it, you bitch. I recognize the picture.
what picture? What are you talking about?
the one from drama camp.
What...?! - Who do you think you are?
Hey! She said she didn't do it.
Oh, I get it. The Florricks.
Oh, no. It's-It's okay. Glenn, stop it!
don't worry, you're still beautiful.
he's such a jerk.
well, you were very brave.
no, I was just...
thanks for sticking up for me.
I got to go.
stay in.
Mr. Bishop?
Oh, yeah. Now I know you.
Yeah, but your firm... I thought you guys went bankrupt.
not yet, but we are working on it.
you're working on it.
so, what are we after here?
actually, uh, I work for Alderman Wade.
it would be really helpful if we could prove that the donations he received came from someone other than Islamic extremists.
well, I'm no Islamic extremist, lady.
no. I-I didn't think that you were, sir.
it's just that the day after Wade accepted the $50, 000 donation, he made a 180-degree turn on building a mosque.
we just need to show that the money's irrelevant. That's all.
well, I wish I could help you, but I like to donate anonymously.
you know, like Jesus said.
do good deeds in private, so only your Heavenly Father will reward you.
sure, but uh... we could keep you anonymous.
no. Thank you, though.
this is what I need.
I need you to stop asking questions about my business.
my apologies.
good luck with Wade.
I hated the Pistons. But I always liked him.
every year, Cook County police map out gang territories according to crime statistics, arrests, and gang tags.
this is a copy of last year's map.
this territory here, according to police, belongs to Lemond Bishop.
our old friend, Bishop.
he seems to be doing quite well.
and who's this here?
this is Cobal Sixty. A competing gang.
they ran a meth house from the squatters' building here.
that's the building that was torn down, and the Al-Mirad mosque was built in its place.
Oh, my God.
this is a copy of this year's map.
Lemond Bishop occupies it all.
alderman Wade wasn't being paid off by Islamic extremists.
the mosque was irrelevant.
he was being paid off by Lemond Bishop to get rid of his competition's base.
what a defense.
Wade wasn't working for terrorists. He was working for a drug lord.
you took the money.
we found out you took the $50, 000 from a drug dealer. - From a businessman.
come on. Lemond Bishop's as much a businessman as I'm a point guard.
you helped him control territory.
when did the rules get tougher for black politicians?
of course I took a campaign contribution.
of course I treated that contributor like a friend.
Oh my God. You're like a little kid who gets his hand stuck in a cookie jar, starts yelling about racial bias.
no, I'm like a little kid who had to wait in line for the white kids to get their hands out of the cookie jar.
well, we're talking a plea bargain now.
we can get them down to five years. - No.
Wade, our only defense is that you're just as corrupt as any other politician in this damn town.
then argue it! - We have no options!
we got two wars in this country. Terrorism and drugs.
you just went from one enemy camp to another.
I'm not taking a plea.
now... You gonna suit up?
Oh, hello, Mrs. Florrick. - Yes?
I'm Becca. I'm-I'm visiting Zach.
Zach, I think, is still at school.
Oh. Oh, wait.
Oh. That's him.
um, he asked if I could wait. He'll be right up. Well, may I?
certainly.
I guess he had to take Nisa home first.
she's his... his girlfriend.
so you're not... Zach's girlfriend?
no. We're just study partners.
I - I don't have time for boyfriends.
my dad says,"Get into a good college first, "and then we can talk about boys.
so you haven't met Nisa? - No.
Zach is a real sweetie to make her feel at home.
her family's from Somalia, and I know how out of place someone like that can feel here.
no. He wants to go forward. - With what?
with whatever we got. He considers this a racial prosecution.
it is a racial prosecution, but it's a racial prosecution we're gonna lose.
we still have the wiretaps.
there's a lot of people on them.
campaign operatives. Politicians who seem pretty savvy about the cash.
show the hypocrisy of the prosecution by naming the white participants who are not being tagged.
one of them's our client.
who?
well, it wouldn't be Chicago if there weren't a conflict of interest.
okay, so let's finish the taps, collect the names of all the operatives and politicians on them, get our ducks in row, see what kind of brief we can argue from it.
how long have you known Eli was on the wiretap?
a few days. - We don't share information anymore?
well, could you have the mayor phone me back?
of course, Alderman.
I understand how important this is, and of course you understand...
can you listen to this?
but I promise you...
Hey, no one else works on a Sunday.
and what's up with you, Matthew?
I heard you're running into a little trouble.
well, it's nothing I can't handle. Just wondering if you miss Chicago.
the restaurants.
so I heard the machine's falling apart. At least that's what I read.
Yeah, you guys all flee to the White House, and we're left holding the bag.
Oh, come on, Wade. - Who is it?
do you want me to tell Obama that?
ruth Yamaguchi? The actual Ruth Yamaguchi?
no, no, I'll get the briefs together. You finish the tapes.
good news? - The best.
uh, I've asked you here, Eli...
... because I'm starting a new firm with David Lee, and I want your business to come with me.
this move doesn't seem like you. It's more like Will-- I know.
I discovered Will and Derrick Bond were thinking of pushing me out, so this is me being proactive.
this is happening when? - Soon, in a few weeks, which takes me to the second thing that I have to ask of you.
I need you to keep this confidential until we're ready to make our move.
where is Mrs. Florrick going?
I - I don't know.
my guess is... she might stay with Will.
but I'd like her to come with me.
thank you, Diane, for this confidence, but I can't commit to a move.
I have to see where the chips fall first.
I understand.
you're being wiretapped.
you'll need a good lawyer.
5/22/10, 8:33 p. m.
alderman Wade.
alderman Wade"? Listen to you.
Hey, Will, I saw it was you, man. It was a joke.
I don't think it was a joke.
I think you've turned into Alderman Wade, Savior of the 53rd Ward.
Yep, no time for the little people.
so did you talk to her? - I did.
And? - Choked.
no, you're kidding. What'd she say?
nothing, she didn't say anything. - She blew you off?
she didn't even phone me back. I asked her to phone me back and...
wait a minute, you didn't talk to her in person?
she was at her husband's press conference. What was I going to do?
Oh, come on, grow a pair, dude.
I did; I even phoned her twice.
once, I said,"Let's move on," then I phoned back to...
2518 minimization. 30-second break.
tap resumed.
I guess I thought it was obvious.
you spill your heart in person; you don't do it in a voice mail.
I don't know. - Right, that's why I'm telling you.
now, listen to me.
go to her now and you're going to say the same thing in person.
no, I'm done.
I'm over it, and that's good. It's like something lifted.
if I weren't her boss and she weren't married, and...
we'd be having a different conversation, but...
she's right not to phone...
and I'm good with it.
Hey, I just wanted to say...
look, you're right.
I don't have a plan.
it's wrong. I'm your boss, you're my employee.
let's just drop this. Okay?
your Honor, in my opinion, if I may be allowed just to
no, in my opinion,
ms. Lockhart, I am seeing no reason to dismiss these charges.
the motion is denied. We will continue to trial.
now...
is there anything else? - Yes, just one more thing, Your Honor.
your Honor, we ask that subpoenas be ordered for a person caught speaking on the government wiretaps.
I'm not allowing a fishing expedition here, Counselor.
I understand that, Your Honor.
in our opinion, there is only one person we need in order to offer context to the charge that Alderman Wade was bought by Islamic extremists.
and who is that?
this witness is on the government tapes?
she is, Your Honor, discussing Alderman Wade's relationship with Muslims.
your Honor, just to be clear, Ruth Yamaguchi is...
she works at the White House. - And...?
her connection to this case is tangential, at best.
in your opinion?
Yeah, of course.
your Honor, we understand that Ms. Yamaguchi works for President Obama, and there may be some reluctance to hear
president Barack Obama's name mentioned in the same sentence as "Muslim" and "terrorist,
but in my opinion, that should have no impact on the path to justice.
I would agree.
the subpoena is so ordered. Is there anything else?
ms. Vashey?
your Honor, we will need a five-minute recess.
bad time?
Brad Pitt has an earring.
we're studying, Grandma.
I know.
she doesn't like me.
tell her you have a 4. 2 GPA, and she will.
no, my guess is she still wouldn't like me.
Becca uh-oh. check out
who's Becca?
for God's sake! He's done with her.
it was a one-time thing. It's over!
would you just stop following me?! - Beat it!
that's your sister?
my dad already said he beat it, and he'll beat it again, if he has to
just like everyone else. - You gotta beat it!
When'd she do this?
he slept with one hooker, okay? One hooker!
Ju-Ju-Just... one hooker! One hooker! - Hey, look, a lot of hits.
what don't you understand?
one hooker! One... one... one hooker! - Beat it - One hooker! What don't you understand? - I got to phone my dad.
good job. The government freaked out about the Ruth Yamaguchi subpoena.
they're dropping the case against Wade.
come on, Florrick, give it up.
good job.
Yeah.
I, um...
do you...?
I need to ask you a question.
sure.
I hate your towels. Oh, hey. What's up?
I don't you making the same mistake as the government, thinking that, because of the color of my skin, I sell drugs.
why shouldn't the courts be kept honest about Bishop?
everybody deserves representation.
does that stop suddenly when it comes to...
a criminal organization whose sole purpose is to sell drugs?
in Baltimore, he was working two jobs.
when he wasn't protecting Bond & Associates interest, he was out protecting MS-13, Baltimore's biggest meth gang.
bond played us against each other.
I don't like being played.
so I suggest we do the same to Bond.
counselor?
thank you, Your Honor.
Mr. Rubio, what is your job?
I'm a guard at the Northeast Illinois Correctional Center.
and what is this?
an outdoor cell on the yard.
we use it when an inmate acts up in the prison yard.
and did anyone act up on September 14th of last year?
Yes, sir.
some inmates got in a fight, so I placed one in the cage.
and was it this inmate?
Yes, sir.
then I turned away to handle the others, and when I came back, he was...
winston was stabbed.
and this is how you found him?
Yes, sir.
dead. With this weapon?
Yes, sir.
a shiv found inside the cage.
and who did this shiv belong to? - Him.
you're referring to Joey Church, inmate #321120? - Yes, sir.
nothing further.
Mr. Rubio, were you aware of any previous conflicts between my client, - Joey, and the victim? - No.
winston had just been transferred in the week before.
and how long did my client have left on his 18 month sentence?
two weeks.
do you find many convicts with two weeks left on their sentence performing acts like this one?
objection.
sustained.
to clarify, Mr. Rubio, you didn't see the stabbing occur?
no. Unfortunately, I did not.
and how did you determine that this shiv was my client's?
well, they found his DNA on it.
but it was fashioned from his toothbrush, correct?
Yeah.
so that would explain the DNA.
objection.
outside Mr. Rubio's expertise.
I think it's just common sense, don't you?
the defendant's toothbrush would have his DNA on it.
overruled.
Mr. Rubio, do inmates ever steal personal items from one another?
all the time.
so it's possible that another inmate stole my client's toothbrush?
sure, possible.
nothing further.
your Honor, at this time, we would like to be heard on precluding the prosecution's next witness.
your Honor, the defense had ample time to argue during pretrial.
Yes, but new information has come to our attention.
come on. I'm always amazed at how convenient this new information is.
counselors.
shall we take this lovely little debating society into my chambers?
they're coming after bought testimony.
no. They'd play that in court.
it's the lie detector. - They dinged us on lack of motive.
we need our eyewitness. - I know.
whenever I see that bitch, I know we're in trouble.
their eyewitness denied seeing anything, Your Honor.
Yes, initially, because he didn't want to be seen as a stool pigeon.
we offered no deal.
Mr. Ellis changed his mind of his own free will.
after the police conducted a lie detector test.
a lie detector test he willingly agreed to.
which caused him to change his mind and claim he saw this stabbing.
right. Because he was caught lying by the lie detector.
carob chips, anyone?
I'm good.
the bottom line, Your Honor, is we don't intend to reference the lie detector in court.
we only intend to use Mr. Ellis' testimony.
your Honor, this is a sworn affidavit from Iderdex.
it's a manufacturer that services all Cook County lie detectors.
they claim, during the week in question, the lie detector was out of service.
clearly, this was a case of the police conducting an X detector.
that is guesswork.
an X detector?
educate me.
it's when the police attach the suspect to a fake lie detector, such as an Xbox or a Xerox machine, making him think that he's been caught lying.
your Honor, even if what Mrs. Florrick alleges is true,
I would cite People v. Lee.
the police have leeway to misrepresent during an interrogation.
I know your boss thinks I'm pro-defense.
excuse me?
your boss-- Mr. Childs.
I know he thinks because I pal around with
bill Ayers and the like that I'm pro-defense.
well, I don't believe that, Your Honor.
the only problem is when I try to be pro-prosecution, the police pull a stunt like this.
people v. s.Lee is not absolute, Counselor.
this was an extrinsic misrepresentation and therefore your eyewitness is excluded.
thank the police, not me.
good job. I didn't see that one coming.
I have to keep you on your toes.
so, anything new on Blake?
you just got my only eyewitness kicked and you want my help?
Yeah.
we're talking a ten percent cut across all departments.
it's not our choice.
if you haven't noticed, Cook County is going through a budget crisis.
so, everybody keep an eye on the O. T.
and unload any dead wood.
we've got a dispo dump at the end of the month.
so separate the chaff.
what about investigator time?
we just got beaten in court because the defense was one step ahead of us.
we're all doing more with less.
some of us aren't.
if you're referring to the Bishop investigation, drugs are drugs.
so we just let a case from Lockhart/Gardner slip through the cracks?
if any case slips through the cracks, the problem isn't the budget, the problem is the A. S.A. Get creative.
use what you know.
okay, moving on.
here's what I know.
no, we already questioned him.
he had nothing to offer.
he's got a parole hearing in a week.
he might be more open to questioning.
getting creative.
don't say anything about the hair.
what's going on?
I hate to lose.
and I hate to lose to someone who's outspending me two to one.
you're on that prison knifing, aren't you?
that's just a pro bono for them.
they got Kalinda on it.
let me look into that.
Diane Lockhart approached me.
about?
a job.
And?
I don't want to go.
but you've got student loans. - Yes, I do.
I put you on these Lockhart/Gardner cases because you know them.
so, show me you know them.
go ahead, read it.
it says because I have a white husband, I'm not really Black.
it says my kids are half-breeds.
it says they should be embarrassed to go to school.
look at it.
it's not us.
it's being distributed in African-American neighborhoods.
church parking lots.
makes no sense for me to go there.
let me read it to you.
is she really. - Come on, Wendy.
we're all adults.
we all could have gone into aluminum siding but we didn't we chose politics.
I haven't gone there with either of you.
well, congratulations.
and I'm telling you I didn't do it.
now tell me why you're really here.
I want a two-way race.
I do, too.
Peter's desperate.
he's almost out of cash.
people are dangerous when they're desperate.
let's talk about it.
there's certain things I can't do.
but I can?
Yes, ma'am.
I was in the prison yard, but I didn't see the attack.
I already said all this.
Yeah, we noticed your parole hearing was in a week.
we thought that might jog your memory.
look, honestly, I didn't see it happen.
but... Church told me he did it.
he told you? - Yeah.
I couldn't believe it.
take a chance like that with two weeks left on your sentence?
why didn't you tell the investigator before?
he didn't ask.
so why did Church do it?
Did-did he say?
because of what Winston called him.
and what was that?
the "N" word.
so we have our motive.
what?
I love to see how uncomfortable it makes you white folk.
what?
am I not supposed to say the "N" word anymore?
no, it makes me feel all warm and post-racial fuzzy.
you know we have a problem now.
we have a motive, but it's sympathetic.
how do you figure?
there's four African-Americans on the jury.
church just killed someone who called him the "N" word.
so how is it going to go over with them?
ms. Scott-Carr. - Mrs. Florrick.
I agree. It's appalling.
my daughter brought it home from school.
she was crying.
I held her for an hour.
I'm sorry. I'm really very sorry, but
I think you need to speak to my husband.
because you're just the wife? - No.
because the campaign is the campaign.
do you believe there are certain things so...
appalling, they're no longer the campaign?
Yes.
but I also think you are in a three-way race, and it's unclear who did this.
we're both mothers first, aren't we?
professional women concerned about the world, yes, but always our children come before everything.
I would do anything for my daughters to see them not hurt, to see them not crying.
you're the same? - Yes.
it alleges that your son got his girlfriend pregnant,
and that your husband paid for their abortion
I'm sure you join me in finding this appalling, too.
and I'm sure there's no truth to it, as there was none to this.
I think President Obama tagged this part of the campaign as the silly season.
it's an unfortunate characterization,'cause I find nothing silly about this.
next time you want to come to my office, you make an appointment.
as one mother to another, if you have any sway there, tell your campaign to stop this silliness.
and I will make sure your children don't come home crying.
good-bye.
to a better future.
do you know how patronizing this is?
I do, but is it true?
so you think a white jury wouldn't judge fairly because the motive...
that's different.
there's no white equivalent to the "N" word.
maybe there should be.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
so, you don't think we'll risk jury nullification with this motive?
I think we can't generalize.
I think people do things for a lot of reasons, - and I think a generalization is being made here based on... - O. J.
based on a false generalization of African-American overreaction to a slur.
this crime happened in prison.
this wasn't a white wine garden party, this was prison.
and I think we can argue, pretty convincingly, that the "N" word is tossed off with some frequency there.
then let's go with the "N" word.
it explains why Church would stab someone two weeks before release.
geneva, you do the questioning.
with relish.
and one more thing.
Mr. Agos had brought it to my attention that a defense investigator's had much success against us.
so I am stepping up our investigation into Kalinda Sharma.
we believe the police have leaked to her, judges have leaked to her, and even some of our own.
I want you to keep track of all contact.
we are going to do our utmost to keep this a level battlefield, okay?
good job, Cary.
good job, Cary.
you know how long I've worked with him, and not a word?
good job, Geneva.
Yup, it helps to have a penis.
the defense attorney is Alicia Florrick.
she's smart.
she'll make you like her.
she'll ask if you've been offered anything in exchange for your testimony.
you need to be able to truthfully say no.
so I'm going to tell you exactly what we can't offer you.
we can't put in a good word at your next parole hearing.
we can't trade you anything. - Not now.
then she's gonna ask you, what did I tell you next?
and I need you to remember something.
what?
just give me a minute.
you going to get out?
you need something?
Yeah. Why are you following me?
you? - Yeah.
I'm not following you.
you here for Lockhart/Gardner or MS-13?
Oh, you are working with some old information there, buddy.
okay, well, I got some advice for you, buddy.
don't follow me.
I'm just standing where I'm standing.
I can make things difficult for you for both your jobs.
you don't want to do that. - Actually, I do want to do that.
I just don't know if I need to.
you don't carry a gun, college boy. - I don't need to.
and you're a hell of a long way from Baltimore.
go for it. It's not mine.
Hello?
ms. Lockhart.
how are you today?
Oh, no. I'm-I'm good.
no, it's a great time. What can I do for you?
what was that about? - It's, uh, posturing.
Lockhart/Gardner's second investigator.
they have two investigators on a pro bono?
we need help.
so in your opinion, Mr. Howell, there was a motive?
well, yeah.
he called him the "N" word, so, sure.
no further questions.
Mr. Howell, you're in prison for check kiting?
Yes.
and I really regret it.
I got behind in my bills, and you know, young, stupid mistake.
did Mr. Agos prep you with that answer?
sure.
and... what did he ask you to say?
well, let me see if I can remember.
he said to tell you that I'd been offered nothing in exchange for my testimony, - and that... - And when he...?
objection.
your Honor, Mrs. Florrick didn't allow the witness to answer fully.
is that true, Mr. Howell?
Yeah. It's a long answer.
continue.
well, then Mr. Agos said you'd ask me an open-ended question which would allow me to talk for a while about my answer.
speaking from my heart, I've been offered nothing in trade for being here.
my reasons are of a personal nature.
I found God in prison, and I'm remaking myself in His image.
it's allowed me to look back on my life and realize where I've strayed from the path.
I heard.
the race card. - Yes.
they have their motive. The jury ate it up.
and I walked right into a trap.
never ask an open-ended question.
okay, okay, let me talk to Blake.
Why?
he may have something. - I don't understand.
it's okay. You don't have to.
what do you mean? I'm the lead attorney.
why wouldn't I have to?
when you two decide on the strategy, tell me.
so what I'm saying is we are not made of money.
Mrs. Florrick.
hello.
xerox room?
anyway, we need to make big moves with little gestures.
Mrs. Florrick, this is a surprise. - Stay there.
I want to talk to you.
no. It's Childs.
this flyer was designed to undercut Wendy's African-American base.
that's not in Childs' interests.
it is in ours. Peter's.
Childs is looking toward the endgame; votes are votes.
he wants African-Americans to sit on their hands.
we have supporters... who are willing to do what we want.
as does Childs.
as does Wendy.
and you're in contact with them? With ours?
some, but I don't control them.
where did you get this?
she visited my office.
have you talked to Peter? - Not yet.
I will take care of this. - Do.
these would be helpful to me.
that help we need, we'll find it here.
we find a five-year-old investigator?
or a six-year-old.
no, no, no. - Yeah!
the clarion call of duty.
the Innocence Project was a million years ago.
it was two years ago, and you were the best one there.
Yeah, well, I'm Super Dad now, see?
Nina's IPO goes public next month.
I don't need the sofa change Cook County offers.
then do it for the fun.
come on. You're not a stay-at-home dad.
honey, go over there and play, baby.
daddy needs to brush off these nice people.
Bryan Stone used to be an airline executive until his wife started a line of purses.
rodrigo Thorton just retired from the Second Circuit.
his wife invented a computer app that just made its first million.
I'm in good company.
you're being bred like the Matrix.
Yeah, well, let 'em.
I'm tired of bringing home the bacon.
come on.
we've got good dental.
come on in.
you've seen this?
what Blake found?
I have now.
you think we should use it?
I think I was told to defer to the partners, so that's what I'll do.
and if you weren't deferring?
I would ask if it were true.
we're running into difficulties with the original strategy.
Yes, but if the new strategy isn't true, it'll be easy to undercut.
what do you think?
I think we don't have much choice.
so you have no memory of Mr. Winston calling you the "N" word?
no. I mean, I'm not saying he didn't, but, if inmates killed based on that, there'd be nobody left in prison.
did anything unusual happen the day before Mr. Winston was killed?
Yeah.
a man visited me in prison.
what man? - I don't know.
he was about mid-30s, white, five-ten.
he was wearing a baseball cap.
this man? - Objection, Your Honor!
this is surveillance video from the Northeast Illinois Correctional Center on July tenth.
I'll allow.
and you had never seen this man before?
never.
who's that in the photo he's showing you?
my daughter, Evie.
she's ten months old. - hell.
and why did this man show you a photo of our daughter?
he said he'd kill her if I didn't do something about Jay Winston.
Mr. Church, did you kill Jay Winston?
Yes.
and why did you?
I'm sorry.
I never hurted nobody before ever, but...
he had a photo of my little girl.
he... It was taken from inside my house.
he said he'd kill my whole family.
it's not true.
okay, tell us.
tell you what, that it's not true?
it's not true. - All of it?
Yeah, all of it.
dad, they say things about your campaign all the time.
and Becca, is she your... is she your girlfriend?
no.
she was. Not anymore.
you know, it's just that - we never really talked about it, Zach. - Dad, please. It's okay.
well, you need to protect yourself. - Mom.
Zach and I talked last year when you were... away.
I found condoms in his backpack. - Not mine. It's a friend's.
and I kept them.
and we were to talk if he ever needed them.
I know it's hard for you to talk to us.
but we're here.
we're always here for you.
okay.
dad, is it getting out? - No.
we're going to stop it. - Thanks.
well, that was a farce. - Why? You don't believe him?
would you have told your parents?
we didn't tell my parents.
Christmas vacation we were supposed to sleep in separate rooms.
Yeah, but we were a heck of a lot older than Zach.
and kids are growing up a heck of a lot faster.
you could have told me about the condoms, you know.
Yeah, I could have.
I want to share the bedroom again.
my parents slept in separate bedrooms for 20 years.
I don't want my parents' marriage.
I don't either.
because I'm not just a dad.
I'm not just a man on your arm.
and I'm not just your roommate.
I know.
so?
I need to think.
so who is he?
he had to sign in.
we had to sign in.
he did sign in under an assumed name.
fake license.
how is that possible?
it... It isn't.
somebody made a mistake.
Rita? - Who?
who signed him in?
no. The baby carrots.
just tell her the baby carrots are a train.
Yeah.
who signed him in?
that's where this gets interesting.
I don't remember much about him.
I guess he used a fake I. D.huh?
Yeah.
so it's just... it's kind of odd.
how many guards are there here?
285. 63 per shift.
and yet, in the matter of one week I've dealt with you twice.
I think what he means...
it's probably just... It's nap time.
hold on, Rita.
I think what he means is, not only were you turned the wrong way during the murder, you're also the guard who let the mystery baseball man in.
go ahead, Rita.
so?
just interesting, isn't it? - I find it so.
this is not looking good.
I know we don't consult.
I know we don't coordinate.
but if we had a safe word, I would be screaming it right now.
you want me to stop whipping you?
the flyers involving her white husband.
I don't know if they're us, but if they are, stop.
you want to know if they're us?
no, but if they are, I need them to stop.
that would be consulting.
Yes. Which I'm not doing.
okay, here's the problem.
do you want to know the problem?
I can't stop, because they're not us.
I don't believe you.
that's your prerogative.
I do know who they are, though. - Who?
your PAC.
you took the money.
they're insuring their investment.
you can tell them to stop, but you're going to have to find some new money.
so we tell them to stop with the racist flyers, they take away the money and our campaign is out of business.
Yep, that's about it.
but who said a conscience is cheap?
what's this?
prison guard's work history.
look at his job two years ago.
Leacrest Stables.
he owns them. - But I don't get it.
why would Lemond Bishop want Winston dead?
here, halfway down the page.
transfer notice.
winston was to be transferred to a courthouse holding cell for a week.
for questioning? - It doesn't say.
spilling to the Feds.
let's say Winston has dirt on Lemond Bishop.
daddy. - Now, if I were... Hello.
if I were Lemond Bishop, then I would want to get rid of him, wouldn't I?
so we have to prove Church wasn't just a pawn.
he was part of it.
no, we just have to go out just for a few minutes to do a little research, don't we?
and then we'll be back.
Mr. Gold. - Becca. Thank you, ladies.
see ya. - Bye.
you seem... upset.
how is it that I can manage aldermen and judges and yet
I still seem to have this ridiculous little mean girl thorn in my shoe.
maybe you're secretly in love.
here's the thing.
I'm not going to ask,'cause I know you'll only lie, and that's okay.
it actually makes things easier.
what things?
when you're asked, you did not sleep with Zach.
you did not hook up with him.
you did not have an abortion.
you don't have to think. Just say yes. - Yes.
and what if I did?
what if you did what?
slept with Zach, and had an abortion?
then we'd have to discuss what was provable.
lake Drive Health Center.
I was there on May 18th.
does that make your job harder?
listen... - No, Mr. Gold,
I'm tired of listening.
have Zach phone me.
I like Zach.
I don't want to make his life harder.
I want to make it easier.
may 18th.
working back, you weren't showing, so that means a March, April conception.
that's when you were sleeping with Mr. Hock you're after-school college prep tutor.
Yes. Appalling, isn't it?
I investigate my opponents.
too bad you don't have the resources to do the same.
so... whenever anyone asks whether you slept with Zach, what do you say?
it's very easy.
I know, given your history, it's probably a new word for you, but you say no.
let's try it.
no. - Good.
always lovely, Becca.
what's up?
just saying hello.
Kalinda, why don't...
I want to talk to you, but I'm going to head out.
you're being investigated.
what? - Childs.
you're doing too well.
it won't be much of an investigation, 'cause I haven't done anything wrong.
a lot of people leak to you.
Yeah, friends. - Yeah.
well, they're going to be scarce.
does that mean you as well?
what are you guys doing with Bishop?
I thought Will and Diane backed away from him.
Yeah, they did.
the Church defense?
it's not some little pro bono, is it?
you don't put two investigators on a pro bono.
I, um, I don't know.
you know what I think?
I think you guys are auditioning for Bishop.
I thought we were out of the drug kingpin business.
he lost his previous representation, and my guess is, it's too lucrative.
do you ever feel like we're not the wrong side?
all the time.
maybe it's not bad.
there are 44 equity partners.
we need 23 to vote Bond out.
he has 22 certain votes.
no, 28.
how do you figure? - His people...
plus the people in Litigation we pissed off. - 24 maybe.
and they may not be so certain if they knew that
bond was making a deal with a drug kingpin.
or they may be more certain.
it's a new economy.
that's what the Joey Church defense was about, right?
we represent Church to gain favor with Bishop.
Yep, we successfully defend a Bishop lieutenant, he swings business our way.
it's a smart move. Brings in a fast influx.
so we need to start lining up votes now.
we can't be seen together so much.
he'll get suspicious. - I'll talk to you later.
it's money, hand over fist!
what were you thinking? - You can do better. Do it!
don't worry.
internecine warfare creates healthy competition.
Hey, I know it from my business.
show me results and I'm happy.
okay, Andrew, we're freezing our asses off out here.
all right, all right, sorry.
what did you find?
good respectable dad.
good respectable meth habit.
no apparent connection to Mr. Bishop.
never worked for him.
never bought from him.
they move in completely different circles.
I'm not seeing much good here.
slow down!
you're gonna stop?
listen, we got kids in this neighborhood, okay?
so if you're gonna drive... - Shove it!
ever hear of Northbrook Youth Soccer?
are you talking to us?
Northbrook, kids soccer league?
okay, I haven't heard of it, but I imagine it exists.
tree Frogs.
it's Youth Soccer.
it's 2006.
wasn't a very good year for them.
five losses, three wins.
look who the coach is.
that's Joey Church.
see, here's the thing - Brian.
I got a vehicle behind on tickets.
it's a gray Lexus, 2009.
plate is 9-Texas- Howard-2304.
no, he needs a wheel lock.
Yeah, right. Thanks.
I never want you as an enemy, man.
so I'm looking at this photo, it occurs to me; the sponsor...
fast & Elegant Dry Cleaners.
it's one of his legit businesses.
before Church got into trouble, he was coaching his son's team, and he solicited Bishop for sponsorship.
so we can show they knew each other.
are you sure?
as far as we can tell, yes.
church was in league with Bishop.
we could turn him.
get him to testify against Bishop.
or get him to turn on a lieutenant.
work up the pyramid.
just so we're clear.
we've built a very strong case against Church.
Yes, but Church is a small fish.
Bishop is the whopper.
a whopper you spent the last five years trying to land.
and now we have new life.
by decimating our case?
no, by turning the case. - You've already turned a half dozen cases, and where are you?
okay, let us discuss it.
sir, you have the dispo dump coming up.
we can nail Church. You can't nail Bishop.
give me a minute.
you, too. Just one minute.
I need you to talk to the investigators about Kalinda.
Why?
they just need some confirmation about a few things.
we've been slipped some anonymous information about her.
what information?
she's been lying under oath, testifying under an assumed name.
well, I don't know anything about that.
but you can offer a background.
Yeah, all right. - Good.
I've been working on some budgetary maneuvers right now.
I should know very quickly if I can improve your position.
I just wanted to drop by and say... - What?
there was no abortion.
not with Zach.
how do you know?
she was with somebody else.
I am sorry about all this in your life.
thank you.
Eli, thank you.
and we had nothing to do with the Wendy flyer.
it was our PAC.
and we don't have any control over them.
so is Wendy still putting out the Zach flyer?
if our PAC goes forward, then Wendy does, too? - No.
Peter told the PAC to get lost. - He...?
when? - Tonight.
so that means...?
we're bankrupt.
he's here on a grand jury subpoena.
different case.
does he know anything? - No.
Yeah, more later.
you want something?
Nope, but you might.
I always want something.
okay, I'm listening.
that man there in the baseball cap?
Yes, sir.
that's one of my associates from California, a Mr. Harden.
again, objection, Your Honor.
you will have a chance to cross-examine, Ms. Florrick, and the jury will have a chance to judge the veracity of Mr. Bishop.
I can't wait.
and that photo your associate is carrying, - that is Mr. Church's daughter? - Yes.
and why is he doing that?
I sent him there.
Mr. Church was worried about whether his family was being taken care of while he was in prison.
I wanted my associate to assure him they were.
and when you say "taken care of"?
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
no, not "taken care of." Supported.
so there was no threat to Mr. Church like the defense is claiming?
no, not at all.
we were merely calming his fears about his family's security and health.
and so there was no pressure on Mr. Church to commit a crime that he already admitted?
that's correct. - Thank you.
do you have anything else, Counselor?
no, ma'am. I think that'll be enough.
what the hell did you do?
got a conviction for first degree murder.
you sandbagged me.
your case was on the docket for years.
I cleared mine in a week.
by overstepping your authority.
we were gonna use Church to get to Bishop.
good luck.
I don't want you to go anywhere.
well, I don't want to go anywhere.
I'd like to make you an offer.
I'd like that.
so, Canada, huh?
excuse me?
I was such an idiot.
I was looking on the West Coast.
don't ask me why. - I'm sorry.
what is it you want?
she died in a Toronto house fire, like, eight years ago.
the body was never found.
seems she was in some trouble with the cops.
I'm still trying to work out the details.
so that's me?
that's my surmise.
am I wrong?
I think you need to find that out for yourself.
how are you?
good.
I love you.
I know.
this is court-ordered mediation.
it's not opt-out mediation or I-don't-feel-like-it mediation.
we know that, but what can we do?
we can't negotiate with a stone.
Yes, but you can lower your ask.
given the set of facts I'm looking at, well, it's way too high.
and the law is far from clear as to...
then let's go to court.
look, the judge doesn't want to clutter up his docket.
that's why he empowered me to keep you here as long as I want to reach a compromise.
and I will. So show me some movement.
our client wanted to sue for $38 million in punitive.
we got her down to 14. That is movement.
but where is theirs?
think about a new ask.
I need you to raise your offer.
come on.
given the set of facts I'm looking at, well, it's way too low.
and the legal issues... - What about their ask?
$12 million for what was clearly an accident?
$14 million. - Oh, my God. It keeps going up.
no, it was always $14 million.
exactly, because they won't move. That's Will Gardner's M. O.
he gets his opposition negotiating with themselves so he can just sit back and...
okay, the good news is, they've agreed to an increase in their offer.
Really? - Yes... $100, 000.
as a goodwill gesture.
but it's linked to an equivalent reduction in your k.
we're not meeting in the middle.
you are meeting in the middle.
everyone's meeting in the middle, or I keep you here.
this was an unfortunate accident...
wait a minute.
I know Celeste works under the mistaken impression that if she says something enough times, it'll make it true, but this wasn't an accident;
this was fraud. Deposition 101, page 58.
but wasn't this an accident, ma'am? Answer...
no, an accident is unintentional.
what your client did to me was intentional.
you sound angry, ma'am.
do I?
I guess I am. I...
would you like to take a break, Maggie?
can we get you anything for your pain?
thank you, Mr. Gardner.
why don't we let Maggie raise her hand when she wants to take a break instead of continually vocalizing her pain into the record?
wow, Celeste. Cynical much?
only since your fifth interruption.
thank you, but I don't need a break.
she esn't need a break, Will.
can I continue now? - It's up to you.
this was all caused by an accident four years ago, wasn't it?
I was in a car accident.
it caused DDD...degenerative disc disorder.
it's misaligned vertebrae discs.
and Dr. Farland, the man you are suing, my client, suggested an operation.
he did.
he said I needed an SCS...a spinal cord stimulator.
a device like this?
our client was given a chance to choose which model to have surgically implanted from a catalogue of 12 FDA-approved models.
but she didn't choose any...
that's the defense's point.
Yes, but I expected him to pick one of the FDA-approved devices.
I was never told there was another option.
and what happened after the operation, Maggie?
the pain was gone.
I was ready to worship Dr. Farland.
but then the pain came back?
Yes, it was like a deal with the Devil. It came back three times worse.
but that's not why you brought suit.
no. About a month after my operation,
I received an itemized bill for the SCS.
on it was listed the manufacturer and the inventor.
and who was the inventor? - My doctor, Dr. Farland.
and this device he invented...it was not FDA-approved?
that's right.
he just implanted it in me like I was a guinea pig.
I want to sympathize...I do...
but you can't keep asking for $14 million.
Maggie has three children. She is in constant pain.
her life has been shortened by a decade.
her husband left her, and she's being kicked out of her house, all because she cannot hold down a job or offer spousal companionship.
now, if that happened to me from a doctor who experimented on me without my knowledge,
I'm sorry, but I would be asking for twice as much.
good job. Keep on him.
and, everyone, the mediator's threatening to keep us here through the weekend, and I think he means it, so make arrangements.
we might have a slight edge in mediation.
the mediator seems sympathetic.
Really? Will that matter?
not really.
we're heading to trial either way, but it shows our argument's working.
what's up there? - I just got a call.
someone who needs crisis management.
one of our clients?
no, someone impressed with the Florrick rehabilitation.
now I'm starting to feel like a slacker.
Eli is starting to clock more billable hours than us.
who is it, one of the airlines?
I heard a jet went off the runway at O'Hare.
no, but I might be able to sign them. I can decide for both of us?
Yes. Just keep me in the loop.
cheese.
cheese?
Yes. We represent the Wisconsin State Dairy Guild, and we need your help.
with cheese? - Yes.
a certain kind of cheese or all cheese?
there was an outbreak of listeriosis in a Chicago grammar school four hours ago.
news reports say the outbreak was traced to bacterial-infected cheese slices.
five children are hospitalized, four teachers are ill, and we're getting alarmed calls from government officials.
does the guild have a contract with an existing PR firm?
Keyser & Associates. They're working on an "Eat Cheese" campaign.
not anymore. You hire me, I am one voice.
tell me if that's okay, or we go no further.
I'll have to get permission. - That's fine for now, but I need someone here who doesn't need to get permission.
Agnes, hello. get me... - Monthly retainer of $60, 000 a month.
hourly still applies. You'll find that's competitive.
fine.
get me everything on listeriosis, anyone who will speak out against cheese.
and I'll need more investigator time. Get Kalinda.
she's on the mediation. - Not anymore.
60...60 a month...
W - wait, hold on.
it was just after recess. The culprit...
the most innocent of foods. Cheese.
this cell phone video - Oh, dear God.
shot by a cafeteria worker, captures several students becoming gravely ill...
we're worried this is gonna keep people from purchasing cheese.
you think?
cheeseburgers and grilled cheese sandwiches...
you'll have to hire Lockhart/Gardner as temporary counsel.
actually, we have outside counsel.
okay, I can explain myself for now, but when things move faster, you're going to have to just trust me.
currently, everything we say and do can be subpoenaed for civil or criminal trial.
and believe me, with news like this, you do not want that.
we need to be able to speak under cover of attorney-client privilege, which Diane provides, and we need it now!
go ahead, get permission.
Walter. Still there?
we also need to hire Lockhart/Gardner as temporary counsel
and get me the CEO of Heather Farms...
before he talks to a reporter.
here he comes now. You just tell him what you told me.
what's wrong? Is everything all right?
I don't know. I got a call from someone at the Vindicator.
she asked if I had an opinion about the results of the medical investigation of Dr. Farland.
the...I don't understand. It's a year off.
I know. She said the FDA expedited it.
she got an early look, and they're siding with Dr. Farland.
it may not be true. - It doesn't matter.
any rumor of an investigation that goes against us hurts us.
did this reporter say when she wanted a comment?
this afternoon.
she has to go to press Monday with the leak.
here's her number. She's the Metro editor.
Kate Hanson...I know her. Let me give her a call.
she'll be easy to stall.
thank you for doing this.
once more around the park.
so what do you think?
I think we have a gun to our head, and can't wait for trial.
we have to get a good deal in mediation. Damn!
be right there.
Owen, can you do me a favor?
Diane, we...
I'll call you back.
I think the mediator's lying to us.
I think you're right.
two hours and a bottle of wine, we can settle this.
just this? Why not the Middle East?
it's game theory with imperfect information, Will.
why don't we make it perfect?
I thought you liked imperfect. Poker over chess.
you sure you're on the right floor?
I'm serious.
we used to settle a lot of things in the old days.
we used to unsettle a lot of things, too.
I'm going into my room now.
you haven't heard our case yet.
it's a good one. - Then I can't wait.
good-bye, Celeste. - My number.
when you're ready to negotiate.
the whole weekend?
maybe not the ole one. It's hot, right? The nights are hot?
steaming.
sultry with the scent of jasmine, forbidden love.
coat, no coat?
no coat.
you're fine with this, right?
I just need someone with the kids rough Sunday.
sure. The fun uncle. I'm the fun uncle.
so you and Will in a hotel room.
Yes.
will, me, four lawyers, six of their lawyers and a mediator.
you and Will checking out the hot tub.
in a businessman's hotel.
the best sex I ever had was in a businessman's hotel.
okay. Can we not go there?
you are so funny. You are the most prudish wanton woman I know.
what was that? - What? Nothing.
I have to go. - But you were about to say something.
you won't get in a fight with Peter, right?
he's picking up the kids for dinner Saturday night.
I didn't mean it...
about the "wanton" Alicia, talk to me.
Owen, I would if I had the time.
you have to wait for the elevator, so talk to me here.
okay.
you're sleeping with Will, which is why you left ur husba.
come on. - I'll call you later.
no, Kate retired three months ago. I'm her replacement, Mr...
Yeah, so you'll be getting a package in about an hour or so, Ms. Battista.
just ignore it. - I already got it.
my parents drink Scotch. They'll be really grateful.
and what might you need?
you contacted my client for comment on the FDA investigation.
I thought I might help.
you wouldn't happen to be fishing for what I might know, would you, Mr. Gardner?
I might be.
I just find it odd that you'd be the on reporter leaked an FDA decision.
maybe I'm just a better reporter.
and maybe you have a source that's lying and trying to undermine this negotiation.
so come in for an interview, and you can offer some context.
okay. How about lunch on Monday?
you mean after my deadline? I don't think so.
how about in my office in one hour?
two hours.
I thought we had agreed this morning to lower your ask by $100, 000.
Yes, and we reevaluated our position, and we're staying with our original ask.
I'm glad you think it's funny.
I thought we were making progress.
we are making progress.
Mr. Gardner has a tell.
when he's in trouble, he doubles down.
so we're lowering our offer.
you don't you think the issues here are too serious to treat like gambling?
no, gambling is too serious to treat like these issues.
we're lowering our offer.
you all right? - No.
okay.
Yeah.
what are you doing?
will wants me to get some inkling of their bottom line in mediation.
Why? - Eli needs your help.
Heather Farms outside Bloomington.
the USDA is investigating this listeria outbreak, and they tend to be slow.
well, which takes priority, cheese or mediation?
both. - All right, got it.
there is no Heather Farms. It's just one division of Karpwell Foods.
and I don't care. I'm not your rabbi, sir.
I'm merely trying to keep your cheese from damaging the imageof all
well, I'm sorry you feel that way, but I do care.
it's not even clear that we're responsible.
I mean, what else did these kids eat? That's what I want to know.
Oh, yes, that's a great line of defense.
with images like these, people love to hear that the kids are really the problem.
do you know who Tony Hayward is? - Do I...
Yes, he's the CEO of British Petroleum.
no, ex-CEO of BP.
the man who many think oversaw the destruction of a brand.
so first thing's first, we work on your attitude.
excuse me? I think we need to work on...
look, I don't have time to argue with you.
the first rule of managing a crisis: the top man answers the questions.
that is the only reason you're here, that is the only reason I am talking to you.
so, in ten minutes time, you're giving a press conference where you'll order all your cheese products off the shelves.
we need a split screen of that image with you looking strong...
wrong tie, get him a red tie...
then you'll apologize for any missteps and say the buck stops here.
actually, he can't do that.
actually, he can and he will.
no, legally, he's in a very vulnerable spot.
he can'te out there apologizing and taking bla.
he's gonna get sued no matter what.
Yes, but the size of the suit is still in question.
I don't care about the size of the suit, Diane.
Yes, Eli, but I do. - I'll just sit here then.
Diane, you're only here as window dressing.
you're only here to keep us from getting subpoenaed.
no, I'm here as their lawyer. You're working the images...
and the images take precedent right now.
he won't have a business unless he...
nice to meet you, Mr. Protopapas.
Dr. Farland was stopping by for lunch.
but if you have any questions...
ms. Serrano, could I speak with you?
this is really inappropriate.
we were having lunch. It's been on the books for weeks.
I am not listening to any evidence off the record, ma'am.
and I am not offering any. I'm standing on the record.
so is the plaintiff. And they offer a convincing case.
an easily-refuted case.
Mrs. Reeves is responsible for her own condition.
how do you figure? - Deposition 200, page 14.
it's so key, I know it from memory.
question: If there's nothing wrong with your device, Doctor, how did it malfunction?
it didn't malfunction.
even the best SCSs are prone to lead migration.
and a lead is... - sorry.
when the electrical leads don't stay where intended.
it's usually not serious, but in the case of Maggie, it became quite serious because the problem went undetected foso long.
that's what caused the infection, which caused the permanent damage to her spine.
and why did it go undetected?
well, I prescribed hydromorphone for any topical pain from the surgery, but Mrs. Reeves... I'm sorry to say this...
but she continued to use the painkiller long afterward.
so, if Mrs. Reeves hadn't overmedicated herself, she would have noticed the infection and come to you for her SCS adjustment?
Yes.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Reeves, but it's true.
come on. Why not blame the victim for having pain in the first place?
Yes, but is it true?
the device malfunctioned, the pain returned.
only then did Maggie take the painkillers.
Celeste reverses it so she can make it seem like the painkillers caused the problem.
if Ian get h up to eight million, will you say yes?
is she offering eight million?
will you accept it?
if you're asking for our bottom line, then no.
we can't give you our bott line or they'll use it against us.
Where's Kalinda?
I'll call. Where are you going?
to meet a reporter.
tonight, school officials are reassuring parents from the school lunch menu for the time being.
it's not yet clear whether cheese at neighboring schools and stores in the area may also be tainte Grace!
grace, Stop eating the pizza!
Really? You were the bad one?
well, yeah, I was.
don't I seem like I was the bad one?
so, in what way bad?
no, you don't nt to hear this.
no, I do want to hear this.
ecstasy. Driving my car into a lake, stealing stuff, juvie.
and Mom?
she was perfect.
homework done, room clean, never did drugs.
never did anything.
she's still like that.
she was a good sister. Always covering for me.
you guys have a good mom.
Grace's tutor.
Hello! Hello. Can we turn it down?
sorry. Wee almost done.
so you're the, uh, the tutor?
what subject?
physics. And just science.
Really?
where do you go to school?
U of C.
and, um...
what's this?
we're making a video.
we're done with all my homework.
got it. Understood. - Oh, my God.
pretty...
provocative stuff.
it's just street dancing.
Yeah, just freestyle.
dad slept with somebody else.
dad. He slept with someone other than the hooker.
he...
how do we know?
he told me.
that's why Mom kicked him out. You didn't know that?
I didn't know that.
what are they saying?
they think it was an improper cleaning of the culture vats in Line Six.
you sound like you don't agree.
well, I clean Line Six with peroxyacetic acid incoming call Alicia and quaternary ammonium after every culture.
they're not gonna find listeria there.
where else could listeria come from?
we keep these units accurate to one degree either way.
I don't think it was a refrigeration problem.
so what do you think?
I think it used to be an easy job to find the source.
now you got some of these cheeses...
they're a blend of three or four lines from three or four companies.
so all I can say is good luck.
damn. Are you sure?
Eli, you know this is a good thing, right?
it looks like your client isn't responsible for the listeria.
Kalinda, this is not the law.
I'm not looking for innocence, I'm looking for certainty.
the whole point is to bury this story with an apology, then move on.
so you want our guy to be guilty?
no, I want it to be over.
I don't want to train another CEO from some other company tomorrow to take the blame.
he can't say this. - He has to say it.
no, he can say,"I offer my deepest, sincerest sympathies to the families.
And,"I'm doing everything I can to trace the source of our missteps.
no. "The source of the outbreak"
Really? Really, Diane?
Hean't say anything that sounds like an admission...
Really?
I am doing everything I can to trace the source of the outbreak.
Heather Farms is committed to finding the root of this...
so why should I hold your story?
well, the Scotch for one. And because it's not true.
it's not true that Dr. Farland's being investigated?
no, it's not true the investigation is going Farland's way.
and you know this how?
I know this because I can see who has an agenda.
in this case, the defense. - Heads up.
why should I care?
because I can make you care.
okay.
I'll give you complete back channel on the case.
as pulse-racing as that is, get me back channel on this.
your computer?
no, the cheese thing.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
the listeria outbreak.
all the sick kids, some were hospitalized...
Eli Gold is part of your firm, right?
I'll delay my story, you get me the back channel ticktock on the crisis managing.
I'll have to talk to Eli.
well, then it wouldn't be a back channel, would it?
get me something behind the scenes.
let me see what I can do.
and by the way, uh, it's not the FDA investigation that's concluding.
the call I got was about the State's Attorney.
turns out, they decided not to bring fraud charges against Dr. Farland.
hello.
may I help you? - You may.
I need information about a fraud investigation.
are you sure?
am I sure I have nothing to offer you about our fraud investigation? I am.
we just need to know if this leak to Gretchen Battista was faked, Cary, that's all.
and if it was, then we need to get her to hold her story.
I understand.
I still have nothing.
how have you been?
come on.
what am I faking?
interest, concern, friendship.
and what if I'm not? - Then let's be friends.
but I still don't have anything for you about this fraud investigation.
check with Matan; it's his case.
he's no use.
because he doesn't want to sleep with you?
but you do?
I'm merely making an observation.
and what observation might that be?
you tend to use people's feelings to further your investigations.
you think that's what I did with you?
I think I have to get back to work.
Cary, whatever I felt, I didn't invent.
that's great to know, Kalinda.
now I have to get back to work and I think you do, too.
Yeah.
ceo blame kids
the CEO questioned the need to recall all cheese products, suggesting that the listeria victims themselves could have been responsible for the sickness.
I don't know that much about it at this point, but I-I would love to know what else those kids were eating because I don't think it's just the cheese.
what the hell?
what the hell?! What did you say?
what did you say?
what are you talking about?
I - I said exactly what you told me...
I don't know enough, but what else did these kids eat"?
you know what you do when you don't know enough?
you shut the hell up. - I didn't say that.
with a garbage bag in your hand? What are you, Chico and the Man?
that...that was in the morning, before I met you.
the press was in front of my house.
they're playing it like you just said it.
they can't do that.
where do you live...Fairyland? Of course they can do that.
okay, Eli, what now?
well, he's burned as a spokesman.
you're going to have to get all the cheese off all the shelves in Illinois.
what? No, I don't think that's possible.
he just blamed the victim. It just became possible.
Owen, thank you so much.
I've been in mediation all day, couldn't geaway.
how are the kids?
good. Grace is bonding with a shy dance teacher and
Peter told Zach that he slept with another woman.
what?
grace is bonding with a...
no, what did Peter say?
Oh, yeah, he told Zach, your son, that he, Peter, was at fault for you kicking him out 'cae he slept with somebody else, and so now I'm wondering who that somebody else was.
Zach told you this? - He did.
and what did Zach say to him?
to Pe... nothing. I think he just took it in. So who, who is it?
I have to go back to work.
come on, Alicia, work is like this new avoidance tactic for you.
is Zach all right? - Zach's fine.
Zach...he's, he's wondering how you are.
How...how are you?
I've got to get back to work.
there you are.
Kuhn? - Yep,
I think you were up by 32 last time we played.
nine years ago? - That's right, you always hated my memory thing.
one Cheerio ante? - Two...inflation.
so I heard you got married.
twice. Heard you didn't.
you were always bad at bluffing.
who's the lady friend?
the...? - The lawyer.
I get a strong possessive sense there.
you're not going to say?
I say either way, you'll use it in negotiations.
call.
so how do you know Gretchen? - Gretchen?
the reporter. Through your firm?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
so are we gonna play cards all night or are we gonna negotiate?
how about both?
you lose this hand, you convince your client to take my deal.
I lose this hand, I convince my client to take your deal.
what deal? - $10 million.
and if I lose?
she takes $500, 000.
so that's your bottom line, huh,$10 million?
I miss you, Will, I really do.
why did you drop out?
I didn't. Moved on.
to...? - Adulthood.
as I remember, we did some pretty adult things ourselves.
come on, one bet.
we settle this like adults.
no mediator.
your lady friend will be so impressed when you show up at her door with $10 million in your hand.
no, thanks.
come on. Where's the old Will?
embrace the risk. - No, thanks.
wuss.
too bad, you would have won.
calling Zack
anything?
they want to pay $500, 000, but they're willing to go to $10 million.
you're kidding? - Nope.
we were willing to take $5 million.
the only bad news is,
I don't think she planted the story with Gretchen, but I can't tell.
she's a good bluffer.
anything else? - Yeah, she's gonna try to play you.
in what way? - Jealousy.
using your past? To what end?
rattle you, get you to admit the bottom line just for the kick of it.
so you and her, huh?
two years. - I just don't see it.
I was a different person.
and she's the same? - Oh, yeah.
well...
what if I play jealous...
for the mediator?
maybe you should.
tantric sex.
no, sex sex. - No, no, tantric sex.
you have to eschew frictional orgasm for a higher form of ecstasy.
no, can't we have a little frictional orgasm?
we don't touch, we don't undress.
we talk about our childhoods, anything but sex.
delaying gratification is to increase gratification.
Yeah, but I've spent the last three hours doing laundry, and the kids are gonna be home in a couple of hours, so I don't really have time for delayed gratification.
they're home early.
hello. What a surprise.
how are you?
Jackie, how...funny.
Yes, so Peter asked me to pick up Zach and Grace.
I hope you don't mind, I have my old key.
hello. - Hello.
my name is Finn.
Finn's a friend of mine from school. Jackie, you're a little early.
Yes, well, I thought I'd clean up. It always gets so messy here.
but, um, why don't I come back later?
no, no, sit down, talk with us.
you must have incredible stories to tell about your life.
Finn, Jackie's early. She needs to go.
no, no, thi-this is a perfect moment for us to learn about her past.
tell us about your childhood.
my childhood? - Yes.
where should I start? Chicago was very different when I was a girl.
no, Mommy will help you.
no, Mommy will.
I have to go.
good-bye.
kids? - Boy and girl.
you think this mediation is hard?
I'm really sorry about all of this.
Hey, they're all tough.
we just have to remain human.
how do we do that?
find a box for this and keep it in that box.
thank you.
we are not paying a cent above her medical bills.
then let's go to court.
you failed, Will. Just face the fact.
okay, stop. - How did I...
the point of bringing you two together is to talk, not to shout.
I know what it looks like when he fails, and he is failing.
Alicia, talk to him.
excuse me?
I'm just saying, Will and I talked last night...
Celeste... - What?
and we were trying to negotiate a deal, but clearly his ego got in the way, and I used to be able to talk to him.
I can't talk to him now, so you'll have to talk to him.
Celeste, what are you doing? - I'm talking to her.
I'm just saying that Will and I got together, we had a productive session, that's all, and I was thinking we should do that again.
okay, I think we've taken a turn towards the personal, and what I think we should maybe...
excuse me.
okay, you want to be productive? Let's be productive.
you already tried the blame-the-victim defense with your painkiller O. D. fiction.
that didn't work. - Who's saying it didn't work?
I am.
well, we'll prove the opposite in court.
no, you wot.
I know the judge. He won't allow it.
so maybe you should raise.
Zuggler Med project manager. Deposition 207, page 13.
what's this? The backup plan?
question: So you believe you were within your rights "to manufacture this SCS device,
and Dr. Farland was within his rights to implant it in his patient
of course. According to the FDA's own rules.
but Mr. Gardner seemed to imply that Dr. Farland was Josef Mengele.
Josef...? - The...
that's okay.
fda rules say that you were within your rights to manufacture this device, correct?
Yes. They allow manufacturers, like ourselves, to decide which devices need to be submitted to them for approval.
and if a new device is merely a minor modification, then, according to FDA guidelines, it doesn't need approval.
ms. Serrano's reading is surprisingly selective.
why don't you keep going?
what is this?
that? It's a BR1. It's a spinal cord stimulator.
and this is FDA approved? - Yes.
and you aim that Dr. Farland's SCS is a minor modification of this?
Yes. That's why we didn't need to submit it to them for approval.
so, then what is this?
that's Dr. Farland's SCS.
so, you're saying that this is a minor modification of this?
IRA, you can't judge these with a layman's eye.
medical professionals who manufactured Dr. Farland's device concluded that these two devices were similar.
these two? - Yes.
in fact, I anticipated Mr. Gardner's bringing this issue up again, so I had a study done by the respected Benzor Labs in Quantico, Virginia.
what's it say?
that it's a minor modification.
the mediator's on our side. - Yup.
nice job, by the way, but he still was impressed by this.
okay, so we have to get someone to say it was vastly modified.
we need Kalinda.
I want to repeat, this is only a precaution.
we are removing all Karpwell cheese from circulation.
Yeah. Gretchen, I'm kind of busy right now. What do you need?
so you're the man behind the cheese, Eli, is that right?
I'm the...
who told you that? - An unnamed source.
and what else did this unnamed source tell you?
he said you're crisis managing for the listeria outbreak, and that you investigated Heather Farms, and the outbreak's not from there.
the political revival of scandal-plagued State's Attorney, Peter Florrick.
he is also known for being a tough infighter.
though never confirmed, Eli Gold was also thought to be the architect of an ugly racial attack on his opponent.
so, why is this wholesome brand hiring a spin doctor known for rehabilitating scandalized politicians?
are you there, Eli?
hello.
any comment?
I'm not part of the story.
I'm sorry, Eli. You just became part of the story.
so pull up a chair.
it's not all bad, Eli.
it is all bad.
you become the story, it deflects from your client's guilt.
I become the story, it makes my clients look guiltier.
who leaked it, Diane?
Eli, it's a fool's game to look for a leaker.
Gretchen knew we checked Heather FarMs. She knew it was clean.
I told two people about that...you and Kalinda...
but Gretchen said the leaker was a he.
did you tell Will?
Oh, he went to the kids' vigil.
I thought you said he was burned.
he was. You're changing the subject.
I am. So, you tried to un-burn him?
you haven't seen this yet?
Oh, my God.
it's wonderful, isn't it? People love humility.
Tony Hayward needed a pie in the face.
you didn't. - set it up? No.
that was just luck.
I thought he'd just get booed.
I'm proud to be here today. I don't care in what condition.
I'm good at my job, Diane, but I can't have leakers.
it's unprofessional.
will didn't leak.
so you're here to give up.
ten million, and we won't accept a penny less.
Really?
you and your lawyer friend cook something up?
it didn't work for you to blame the painkiller.
it didn't work for you to blame the victim, so minor modification.
that's what your case rests on now.
Dr. Farland's SCS is merely a minor modification of existing SCSs.
have some pastrami, Will.
let's leave all this boring medical talk behind.
the problem is, medicine is a lot like politics.
and all we had to do was follow the money.
she never was jealous, was she?
your lawyer friend. That was all a piece of playacting?
Dr. Farland, your man of healing, invented an SCS to make money.
30% on every device implanted.
sorry. Sorry.
who was that? - Kalinda.
here's a copy for you. - What is this?
Farland's patent application.
Yeah, I know. It's a good read, though.
the problem for you is, Dr. Farland had to insist on its originality.
I get it. You don't have to lord it over me.
no, I won, so you have to listen.
Dr. Farland had to insist on the originality of his device to file a patent.
this SCS is a truly original developnt "in severe back pain management.
it is not a mere modification.
how nice of him to use those words. "of existing SCSs on the market.
therefore, patent. - I can read.
you're not going to be a sore loser, are you?
eight million dollars. - Ten. By today.
no.
eight. That's more than you thought you'd get.
I'll talk to my client.
I need a new home.
you need a... - New home.
my firm is going under.
Monty & Columbech? - Breaking up.
Litigation's going one way, acquisitions another.
how many in litigation? - Me.
eight other top-flight lawyers. We need a home.
I'll check with Diane.
I miss you.
so, it looks like we'll make a deal.
I heard.
I just wanted to thank you for all of your hard work.
you don't have to thank me.
I wasn't the one who played them.
we...
that's not why we won.
you won because of the facts.
you got your client rich because you played them...and me.
that's not fair. - It is fair.
it may not be polite, but it is fair.
don't worry about it.
if I needed a lawyer, I'd probably hire you, too.
very nice to meet you.
Hey, Mom.
just wanted to see how you were doing.
how's your thing?
it was good.
I don't know. I go back and forth on work.
Yeah. Same with Dad.
I want to do something very old-fashioned.
I want to kiss you on the forehead. Is that all right?
sure.
tucking in is too much. - Right. Sorry.
love you.
I'm getting boring. - Getting?
I'm serious. I used to be...
interesting.
I spent the entire day doing laundry and watching daytime TV.
I saw the clothes. Thank you.
I mean, when did this happen?
you're the one out having sex with your boyfriend.
Owen... - And I'm the one at home with the kids.
and it's much appreciated.
are you gonna get hurt by this guy?
I don't know. I have no perspective.
you should have rebelled in high school. Then you wouldn't have to do it now.
is that what this is, rebellion?
or love.
it's not love, is it?
no.
good.
cause that would make it very complicated.
the breadwinner for a while. It's not gonna last forever.
I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity.
glad you could come aboard.
not only are you coming back to the workplace fairly late, but you have some very prominent baggage.
but, hey, if she can do it, so can you.
Oh, the investigator. - You're Peter Florrick's wife.
that's right.
last time I was in court was 13 years ago.
wow, I was 12.
state's attorney's here.
I'm Glenn Childs. Peter blames me for his downfall.
don't make yourself collateral damage here.
the day you leaked that sex tape to the press and forced me to shield my children, that was the day I became collateral damage.
you've obviously never made a woman angry before.
an hour ago, I resigned as State's Attorney of Cook County.
but I do admitto a failure of judgment in my dealings with these women.
I've never abused my office for sexual favors.
give us time to heal and rebuild their trust... trust...
mom, breakfast.
Oh, hey, congratulations. That's great.
your husband's appeal - it looks like he could get out of prison any month now, huh?
looks like it. - Early Show had a story on it.
some good stuff on you, too. Did you catch it?
no, missed it.
Yeah, I caught it online. I can send you the link.
that's okay. - No, no, no, it's easy.
so Litigation wants me on this new class action.
that's where I'm headed. What about you?
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, in here, I guess.
DIANE: When did you say this was?
may 15, four months ago.
do you have anything with the date?
a parking receipt.
had you ever met Mr. McKeon before?
no. I'd seen hisfamily on the news.
I heard about their hotels and stuff, but that's about it.
will: Well, the problem here, Christy, is that any civil suit could be seen as
opportunistic.
because of their money?
Yes.
I'm sorry, but I didn't choose my rapist.
DIANE: This kid doesn't know what she's in for.
taking on the McKeon family... - Alicia, if you don't mind, we just need to...
no, it's allright, stay.
I don't know about this.
it's a criminal case, not a civil one.
except the new State's Attorney rejected the charges.
Yeah, because it's got Duke lacrosse written all over it.
Oh, come on. - What come on? Put your politics aside, Diane.
you're Glenn Childs, you get this dropped in your lap
a stripper at a bachelor party accusing the son of the most powerful family in Chicago of rape - and you don't think it's Duke lacrosse II?
he's worried about the McKeon family money.
he's worried abouttheir campaign contributions.
well, I'm worried thatwe're overextended.
how many Sheffrin-Marks depos do we have left?
2/10. - 2/10.
we need to keep our eye on the ball.
and Christy is just gonna look like she's trying to make some quick cash from the McKeon family.
do you believe her?
I believe a lot of things I can't prove.
all right, here's what I think.
I know the McKeon family lawyer.
Ericcson? - Right, William Ericcson.
that's just what we need - two Wills.
the McKeons are gonnawant to keep this out of the press, even if he didn't do it.
so my guess is they throw her some cash, maybe 50 grand or so to keep her quiet.
hmm, yeah.
Mr. Ericcson, please.
tell him it's the other Will.
I want you to be at this lunch. Don't say anything. Just listen and look serious.
I can do that.
how you holding up here?
I'm holding up.
Oh, yeah, how do you know her?
who?
Christy. - I don't.
then why did she ask for you to be on the case?
I don't know.
Ericcson here.
I think you know why I'm calling.
two months ago, Peter Florrick was sentenced to ten years for bribery and corruption.
today was the first step toward his release.
he was known in Chicago simply as "The Hammer."
he jailed cop-killers, CEOs, corrupt politicians, until "The Hammer" got hammered.
an hour ago, I resigned as State's Attorney of Cook County.
within weeks, Chicago's incorruptible State's Attorney found himself with all the trappings of a modern American scandal:
a rival with an eye on his job, an embarrassed wife, a blushing call girland an R-rated sex tape.
does she do this for you? Does she?
Oh, God, please. You are ama...
Hey, ever heardthe whole thing?
no. - You're the only one who hasn't.
everything Ihave on McKeon.
What?! I beat you three sets to two.
Oh, come on, you don't even believe that.
this is driving me crazy. How do I know you?
me? - Miner, Parsons & Layton?
Alicia is actually our newest junior associate.
one month in.
will Ericcson, Alicia Florrick.
well, it is very nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.
you, too.
I'm rooting for your husband.
I know he has a lotof enemies in this town, but I always root for the underdog.
Oh, just ignore him.
the only reason someone's forced out of public office in America these days is sex.
so let's talk about Lloyd McKeon.
it's so sad, really.
I remember when you had a respectable firm, Will.
one that wouldn't sink to scurrilous charges like these.
and what chargesmight those be, Will?
I haven't said anything yet.
do you think you're the first firm she's shopping this lawsuit to?
there's nothing there.
even the State's Attorney - the new State's Attorney - thinks there's nothing there.
and yet I got you to a settlement lunch on a half hour's notice.
Mrs. Florrick, what would you say to someone bringing unsubstantiated sexual charges against a public figure justin order to gain an advantage?
you want to know what I would say?
I would.
I would say you're trying tochange the subject from rape.
well, I would agree that, as offensive and misguided as these charges are, the optics aren't exactly in our favor.
so we're willing to make an offer.
it's nonnegotiable.
you have till end of business day.
McKeon did it.
under a hundred thou, I would've said no.
over a hundred thou... - What about well over?
if you don't mind my asking, Ms. Barbosa, why did you request me?
I saw you on TV.
I thought you'd understand what it's like to be misunderstood.
ladies. Sorry about that.
McKeon's lawyers made a financial offer that Diane and I actually agree on.
a first.
it's a cashsettlement. $450, 000.
you're kidding.
we don't have to go to court? He just offered that?
you'll have to sign a standard confidentiality agreement.
both parties free each other of liability and agree not to speak to anyone, including the press.
what? - It's standard in civil agreements.
I want everybody to know he settled. Can't we tell the police?
not if we sign a confidentiality agreement.
McKeon could withdraw the awardand sue you for defamation.
what do you think?
I think under the cir...
I think you're looking for justice, Christy.
and sometimes justice comesin a form we don't expect.
if you take this money, the settlement will be known to the two people that matter most, you and him.
I'm sorry, no.
he'll know how much it costs to rape somebody and getaway with it, that's all.
this is about him admittingthat he did this to me.
she's right.
okay, Ericcson, how flexible are youon confidentiality?
exclude newcriminal discovery.
Oh, come on, this isn't... you want to go to court, is that it?
take it as far as pretrial? He doesn't wantto go to trial.
look, Ericcson, you want to make McKeon the Bachelor Party Rapist, be my...
that's how you want to play it?
we just turned down a half million bucks.
feels good, doesn't it?
looks like we got a case.
you have to size these things up pretty quickly.
12 clients, stockbroker types, no one out of control. It was easy.
they paid $400 for a 90-minute, two-girl fantasy strip.
two girl?
who was the other girl?
Maura... I - I don't remember her last name.
that was the only time she worked.
sorry.
she insists on being here during all this. It's a nightmare.
and McKeon, how'd you meet him?
the groom?
he offered me another $100 for a private lap dance.
when I got in the bedroom, he locked the door.
then he grabbed me.
I tried to get the mace from my bag, tried to shout.
did you tell anyone afterwards?
Maura. And our driver Grant.
he was the one who suggested she drive me to the hospitalfor the rape exam.
and the service, Worldwide Elite, how long did you work for them?
two years. - And what else did you do there?
what do you mean? - I mean, what else did you do there?
for a year, I was an escort.
didn't you think that might be important to tell us?
I haven't gone on a call in a year.
I was in an abusive relationship.
I needed the money to move out.
when I moved, I stopped working.
but still stripped.
so what's your point - a call girl can't get raped?
Yeah, that's my point, thanks. - Look, she lied to us.
why believe her now?
cause she walked away from half a million dollars.
and when did sheever lie to us?
you know, the more you bond with these clients, the less helpful you are.
your stripper was hooking.
why is she my stripper when she does something bad?
okay, so the point is to prepare for trial so we don't actually have to go to trial.
Cary, right? - Yes, sir.
nice suit. I got a job for you.
I need you to take Alicia's Sheffrin-Marksdepos for the week.
all right, I'm on it. This is settlement poker.
no one wantsto go to trial, but the person who plays the better hand makes the better deal.
so get me some good cards.
so your first thought is to come tothe State Attorney's office?
I just need one thing.
and why do I help you, again?
because you like me.
that still works with people? - Mm-hmm, like a charm.
you never should have quit this place.
I didn't quit. I was fired.
come on. You ran a solid rape investigation.
you should be dying to slip us the witness interviews.
Leah, could you come outside for a second?
and you're telling meyour husband had nothingto do with this?
Mr. Childs, my lawfirm is bringing on a civil action, that's all.
designed to embarrassmy office and make it look like I don'tcare about a rape victim.
a happy coincidence?
I understand the need to blame someone for your husband's downfall, but I didn't release that sex tape to hurt youor your family.
I have kids, too. And you should knowI was holding back.
I had more to releaseabout your husband, a lot more.
disturbing things, but out of compassion, I held back.
Mr. Childs, if you have something to show me, just do it, okay?
cause the one thingI don't have time for these days is empty threats.
you want something on your stripper?
get a subpoena.
I liked Christy.
she was one of my best dancers.
but I have nothing else to add.
I'm sorry.
we just need contact information. That's all, Ms. Avarski, for the driver and the stripper.
dancer.
look, I would love... - Because we'd really hate to subpoena your booksand client records.
you're East Indian?
Yeah. - Hmm, it's very popular these days.
contact information?
follow me.
why A-B-C?
$1, 500 an hour, $2, 100 and, uh, $3, 100.
what makes someonemore expensive?
is this about the rape?
no. - Regular clients and special requests.
requests?
no condoms or being dominated or role-playing.
whatever theycan't get at home.
people would really pay $3, 000 an hour?
the day rate is $31, 000, dawn to dawn.
so about this rape, can you get me contact information on this dancer?
Maura? She quit right afterwards.
left a fake number, fake address, fake social.
happens all the time.
what about the driver? Could you help me find him?
so, Mom, where are you, anyway? - Look, I have to work late tonight.
can you ask Grandma if she can stay till 10: 00? - Sure.
grandma, can you stay till 10: 00?
mom's working late.
no need to shout, dear. If she has to, she has to.
grandma can stay.
so, Mom, I was talking to Grandma, and she said she visited Dad this weekend, and he was saying how much he missed us.
grandma said that?
I was thinking maybe we should be going there.
you know, visiting him?
your dad didn't want you to see him like that in prison.
he was... He didn't want you to worry.
but let me ask him - maybe he's changed his mind, okay?
right.
we'll talk about it when I get home tonight, okay?
all right, see you tonight.
I trust you'redoing your homework.
five minutes.
we understand you can corroborate Christy's story.
which was? - That she told you about the rape right after it happened.
look, I like Christy, she's a good tipper, but when she drinks, she doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
but you do?
Christy gave the guy a lap dance, he paid her, we went home.
nobody said anything about any rape.
I don't blame Christy for trying to get extra money out of McKeon, but, hey, she's lying.
is that Dad?
I don't know.
but you're thinking it, too.
jackie: Gonna need your help in a minute.
dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
do we tell Mom?
they sent them to Mom to hurt her.
so I say no.
so?
I don't know. Do they want to see me?
Oh, Zach does, but Grace doesn't?
she's hurt. She thoughtyou were everything.
so two months in, you seem well.
I am. Somegood guys here.
there's probably less backstabbing than the state attorney's office.
you look good.
it's like it agrees with you.
so, here's the thing about Childs.
everything he does is a political calculation.
everything he says... - Peter, no.
I don't want to be used.
Alicia, I know you don't believe me, but Childs set me up.
and if what I give you can help a rape victim, what's wrong with that?
how do you knowshe's a rape victim, Peter?
I didn't tell your mom. - Daniel told me.
your appellate lawyer?
he's the one who referred Christy to you.
what's wrong?
I'm hard-pressed to think what's not wrong.
so he what...?
well... I mentioned to Daniel that you were with Stern, Lockhart, and that if he didn't have time for Christy's case that maybe you would.
I thought you'd want the work.
you thought it was a good idea to send me a hooker to represent?
no, I thought it was a good idea to send you a rape victim.
Oh, my God.
you had sex with her.
what?
you're using her first name, Peter.
you're saying Christy.
she's one of your whores.
Oh, Alicia, would you stop it?
when are you gonna stop thinking that I slept with everyone?
when are you gonna forgive me, for Christ sakes?
how much did you spend on Amber?
you had sex with her, what, ten times, 20 times?
you don't want to know the details of what I did.
if you want me to forgive you, I need to knowwhat I'm forgiving you for.
so at $3, 000 a pop, that's, what, $60, 000?
did you pay her not to use a condom? Was that extra?
your trip to Houston, did you take her with you?
you know I didn't. - I don't know what I know.
Grace's 12th birthday party, you s...
you said you had to leave early.
where did you go, Peter?
you answer those questions, and then we will talk about forgiveness.
this is a pretrial hearing, so don't worry aboutthe driver yet.
we just need to win a few motions.
sorry! - Don't worry about it.
it all comes down to the rape kit.
Kalinda: Still no luck findingthe other stripper.
all we haveis a first name, "Maura," and a general description.
we need to box McKeon in.
there's only one of two ways his semen ends up in that rape kit: consensual sex or rape.
we get him to swear therewas no consensual sex.
why would he do that?
cause he has a wife.
there you are.
how you doing? You nervous?
no, but maybe I should be.
this is just a pretrial hearing.
state's attorney's tryingto squash our subpoena, so today we just get the ground rules straight, in case this thing goes to trial.
Kalinda, I need you to get upstairs, get in the State's Attorney's office and wait for the subpoena.
I'll do that.
what? You don't have to.
I know. I'll be back.
you all right?
Yeah, sure, I'm fine.
Oh, my God, this is too good. We got Judge Abernathy.
he's our newest judge. He's so liberal, he makes Michael Moore look like Rush Limbaugh.
justice may be blind, but judges sure aren't.
God, Ericcson must bepulling his hair out.
all rise for Judge Abernathy.
Oh, please, don't stand.
everybody sit back down, please.
we've got the big room here, don't we?
your Honor, given the statureof my client, Mr. McKeon, and given the fact that this pretrial hearing has already garnered the attention of our friends in the press, we would ask the court toseal the pretrial filings and avoid a show trial.
Oh, Mr. Ericcson, I don't think we need to do all that.
do we? First Amendment issues and all?
I deny the petition with regret.
Mr. Gardner?
Yes, Your Honor.
we have a lot of testimony focusing on whether there was a consensual act between Mr. McKeon and my client, but if Mr. McKeon is willing to stipulate there was, indeed, a consensual sexual act, we would forego this testimony.
that's a good point. Mr. Ericcson, how do you respond?
we will stipulate there was no sex of any kind, forced or consensual, Your Honor.
the plaintiff also requests an expedited trial date, Your Honor, a DNA sample from Mr. McKeon, DNA results from the rape kit, and the investigative reports from the State's Attorney's office.
they have been reluctant to furnish them.
thank you, counselor. I will grant all four motions.
Mr. Ericcson?
I interpret from Mr. Ericcson's, uh, gesture that he acquiesces.
well, I'll see you all back here... Let's see.
my docket is clear.
five days? How's that for expedited?
uh, as a side note, I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the recent mass killings in Darfur.
okay, thank you.
court adjourned.
that was a great start, huh?
I understand you're having trouble with the driver.
and you're boxed in on the rape kit. You should just settle on our terms.
Yeah, right. See you in trial.
May15, four months ago.
this one seemed cool.
so you know Will?
12 clients, stockbroker types.
Mr. Gardner. You two went to school together? That's what they were saying the other night at drinks.
Yeah. - So that's why?
Cary, if you don't mind, I've had only a week with this.
you got an expedited trial date to force the otherside to settle, and now you guys arethe ones suffering.
what are you looking for?
TZK Industries.
I... I've seen it somewhere before.
what is TZK Industries?
TZK Industries.
it's a furnituresupply company. Supplying elegant furniture to home and business.
why What do you need?
something to undercut Christy's driver.
okay.
it can't be that easy, can it?
what?
so I find thisodd, Mr. Grant.
you were there, and you saythere was no rape?
so either you're lying or my client's lying.
all I know is what I saw.
your Honor, request permission to approach the witness.
Yes. Please. Approach.
Mr. Grant, this is a copy of your wife's W-2.
could you read the name of your wife's employer, please?
TZK Industries.
and TZK Industries is a company owned by the - McKeon family to supply furniture to their properties. - Objection. Not in evidence.
well, I think it's all right for it to be asked, Mr. Ericcson.
I... Actually, sustained.
your Honor, you sustained the objection?
I did. Mr. Ericcson had a point.
isn't it an amazing coincidence, Mr. Grant, that after a year of unemployment, your wife got a job in June from the McKeon family, a month after thebachelor party incident?
no. - And why is that, Mr. Grant?
because my wife and Iare divorced.
my wife and I have been separated for a year now, so her getting this job has nothing to do with me.
but, sir, wouldn't you benefit even if only in the form of lowered spousal support?
I guess, but I'm not Warren Buffett.
no further questions, Your Honor.
I'm sorry. I didn't see it.
don't ever let your first chair get undercut like that again.
good news?
I just got the rape kit results.
state's Attorney wasn't stonewalling.
they sent it out to a commercial lab and just got it back.
And?
it's not McKeon's DNA.
the rape kit came back.
it's not his sperm. It's not McKeon's DNA.
grant says you're lying. McKeon says you're lying.
I'm not lying. I... It's really not his sperm?
Christy, we need to get the full - Who else did you havesex with that night?
no one. I swear.
well, you obviously had sex with someone because it isn't his sperm.
so, was it a boyfriend or another client?
you need to find Maura. - We can't find Maura.
you really don't remember anything that could help us find her?
we didn't talk.
she was on her cell phone the whole night till her battery ran out.
I'm sorry.
I need to get to class.
not that I mind it, but since when did you become me?
you didn't believe her. I did.
maybe she is telling the truth.
Christy said the light was flicked out, so maybe McKeon was with a friend.
so let's see if the cops tested the other party-goers.
worth a try.
it's not just that. What's up with your bud, Abernathy?
he's going out of his wayto kill us.
you know how this works. Liberal judge gets on the bench, doesn't want torule from his bias, so he bends over backwards the other way.
I thought you said you had some pull with him. He wanted to be on your Glass Ceiling committee or whatever it is.
Emily's List" Are you suggesting I influence a sitting judge in some untoward fashion"?
no, just in a toward one.
come on, come to the court, let him see your sad littleliberal face...
and contemplate a life without his friends.
will, I'm so sorry.
don't be. We're a team. No apologies.
now what are you doing?
close the door. - Come on, Zach. Just let it go.
would you shut up and look at this?
see that?
it's called a "specular highlight."
it's like a light in the eyereflected in the eye.
see where it is?
it's to the left.
and now, look at this. The lady's eye.
see? The dot's to the right.
okay... - They're not in the same picture.
dad's face was Photoshopped into it.
Hello? Zach, Grace, I'm home.
Jackie, I have a request to make.
certainly, dear.
you want the kids to visit Peter in prison, you talk to me.
you don't talk to Zach. - When did I talk to Zach?
you told him Peter was lonely in prison.
because he is.
just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
Hey, Mom.
how was work? - It was crappy.
I thought I'd make breakfast.
for dinner?
my goodness. - Like when you were little.
you don't have to like it. It's for me.
so, I want to show you some pictures of where Dad's staying.
what?
I want to make sure you know what's involved with visiting Dad in prison, okay?
I'll get that.
so, Zach, can you show me how to get to Google Images on your computer?
Yeah, sure.
what is that?
nothing. Homework.
mom! Someone's here!
still no Maura?
DNA is definitely not from McKeon's semen.
I was going to the crime lab to see if they ever collected DNA from the otherparty-goers when...
you can watch a little TV. I'll be right in.
want to do this later?
no, no, no.
I think I just caught my son checking out porn.
anyway... I asked a cop friend to run the rape kit results through CODIS.
and they got a hit.
who, the best man?
Manny Lyons. A rapist serving 20 to life in an Ohio supermax.
I don't understand. - You're in good company.
and he's a convicted rapist.
Christy was raped. - Apparently.
I don't get it.
was he... Was he at the party?
well, as far as I can tell, he was in a holding cell in Columbus at the time.
this makes no sense. - We know.
this pile is everything on the Manny Lyons rape.
this pile, everything on ours. And we can't find one thing in common.
no connection with McKeon?
Nope, we checked it.
Manny Lyons broke into an Upper Arlington apartment,
held a knife to the neck of a 40-year-old divorcee, raped her, and stole her car.
he was stopped running a traffic light ten miles away.
the divorcee identified him in a six-pack photo line-up.
what?
they do have one thingin common.
and you were the lab supervisor who worked on analysis 5795
the rape kit in this case - Professor?
doctor. - Doctor.
and these are yourinitials, "GG" right at the bottom of the report?
Yes, those are mine.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
this isn't 5795. This is 5794.
the Manny Lyons case. My mistake.
Oh, I see that you ran the analysis on both cases.
given the sequential numbering, I imagine that you worked on one right after the other?
it appears so.
in both cases, the DNA matched the same culprit, Manny Lyons, is that correct?
it is.
so let... Let me follow the logic here.
Manny Lyons... who never set foot in Chicago... - Objection. Not in evidence.
I will sustain that.
isn't it true, Dr. Girtzman, the only connection between Manny Lyons and Christy Barbosa is that you worked on both cases?
objection. Argumentative. - Mrs. Florrick, this is not a debating society.
sustained.
Dr. Girtzman, would you say that the standard of a commercial lab is relaxed?
no. And, uh, Your Honor, may I answer her earlier question?
personal privilege. - Oh, yeah, if you'd like.
we handle an immense backlog of untested rape kits from crime labsall across the country.
we do so with speed and professionalism... - And yet isn't it true, sir, - that your lab almost lost its accreditation in 2005... - Now, that was never proved!
...when it cross-contaminated two DNA samples that were out-sourced from a crime lab...- This is an old slander!
...that you failed tosterilize scissors that then carried the DNA from one sample to the next?
I don't have to answer this. - Actually, you do, sir.
your Honor, given this testimony, we move that the rape kit be reexamined at a second genetic lab.
I think that is an understandable request, Mr. Ericcson.
your Honor, we would stipulate that Mrs. Florrick hasproven her case.
Dr. Girtzman cross-contaminated the sample...- Excuse me?
but we would argue, therefore, that that is the very reason it cannot be tested again.
you've got to be kidding me.
the very fact that it is agreed that the sample is now contaminated means it can't possibly be tested with any authority.
your Honor...
Mr. Gardner, you argued thatthe rape kit was contaminated.
you can't now argue it's probative.
the plaintiff's motion for retesting is denied.
your Honor...! - Motion is denied.
we've got to find that other stripper.
so basically this is a Hail Mary pass?
look at you with the sports metaphors.
Yeah, I don't see manyother options here.
good evening.
do you have a reservation?
actually, we have a... strange request.
we need to get a printout of a phone bill from four months ago.
the name? - McKeon.
first name?
would you liked that e-mailed or a hard copy?
hard copy.
if I could just see some I. D.Mr. McKeon.
um, well, actually can I ask you a question - Rosemary?
there was a bachelor party here in May that resultedin a... a rape.
were you here then? - I was.
well, the only person we believe who can corroborate the rape victim's story was using a cell phone that night.
and we're thinking she usedthe bathroom phone when her battery ran out.
we were hoping to glance at the bill just to see if there was a number she dialed.
I'll have to speak to a manager.
nice thought.
if all else fails, try honesty.
I got 20 bucks on deception.
what are you doing north of the Loop?
you know, just seeinghow the other half lives.
Alicia, this is Marlena.
nice to meet you.
ask for a view of the lake.
it's beautiful at night.
she thinks we're getting a room.
Yep.
now they all think we're getting a room.
you worried?
you?
we could do worse.
I'm having troublegetting my manager.
if you could just wait another minute.
I owe you $20.
okay, Christy and Maura arrived at 10: 15.
right there, 11: 20.
out-of-state area code.
hello. You don't know me...
were you the other dancerthere that night, Maura?
I was, yes.
and your driver, Mr. Grant, what did he tell you after you took Christy to the hospital?
he told us that the McKeons were very rich, and we should all keep our mouths shut.
and that's why you went back home to Michigan?
Yes.
I'm sorry. I was scared.
and to reiterate, Christy told you about the rape immediately afterward?
Yes. In fact, he followed her out into the parking lot and he said, "Don't tell anyone."
just take the money and shut up.
no further questions, Your Honor.
thank you, Alicia.
for... - you know.
Christy, I'm just curious.
where did you meet my husband?
your husband?
I've never met your husband.
my mistake.
all rise for Judge Abernathy.
good afternoon.
I have given this case quite a bit of thought, as you can imagine.
you have both argued your case well.
but I find myself judgingin favor of the defendant.
without a DNA match to the rape kit, we have a classic he-said, she-said;
and as much as my personal sympathies lie with the plaintiff, the evidence does notwarrant a favorable decision.
judgment in favor of the defense.
are you okay? - No.
I'm sorry. I believe you.
this is all I want to say.
I have been falsely accused by a woman who wanted nothing more than a quick payday.
but every year there are thousands of women who are abused, and I don't think we should let this false accusation...
Mr. McKeon. You're under arrest for the rape of Christy Barbosa.
Wha...? - Cuff him.
what? Is this a joke?
it must be hardto lose, Mrs. Florrick.
not if it forces you to prosecute.
I'm coming out of this witha criminal case I'll win, and you're coming out with a loss.
nice job.
Lloyd McKeon was arrested today for rape, literally seconds after he wascleared in a civil case for the identical crime.
state's Attorney Glenn Childs took credit for finding an untainted sample of DNA that will guarantee McKeon's conviction in a criminal trial.
Childs denied that McKeon's arrest was a reaction to...
this is yours? - Yeah.
is he going to jail?
I think so.
well, then that's good.
Thanks.
good night. - Good night.
what do you want me to do?
I want you to beg.
please... oh...
does she do this for you? Does she?
Oh, God, please... You're amazing... - What do you want me to do?
what do you want me to do to you?
just... don't... stop.
what'll you give me?
what'll you give me not to stop?
everything.
the Good Wife:
an hour ago, I resigned as State's Attorney of Cook County.
dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.
who first told you of your husband's infidelity, Mrs. Florrick?
cnbc. I saw it on the crawl at the bottom of the screen.
I'm glad you're making a life for yourself. It gives you a break.
well, I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity. It's a real lifesaver.
no. Glad you could come aboard.
looks like we share an assistant, so tell me when I'm hogging her, okay?
and let the best man win.
you told him Peter was lonely in prison. - Because he is.
just don't go around me by talking to my kids.
Jackie, it'll just have to wait until next week.
but Peter's expecting them for his birthday.
Peter and I agreed I'd bring the kids next week.
their first visit is a big deal. I want to do it right.
and so, you need me for how many nights late?
just a couple, and I shouldn't be too late-- 11: 00 or so.
what do you want me to tell Zach and Grace?
tell them I love them, and I will call them tonight.
and Peter-- what do I tell him?
Jackie... - Okay, then. Bye.
there she is.
Alicia, Marne Compton.
bowdoin, 2005. Summa cum laude.
she worked for three years at Kaplan & Cohick? Personal assistant to Mr. Cohick.
why'd you leave?
there was an opportunity with Habitat for Humanity building an orphanage in Tijuana.
peace Corps. Belize.
and you know we only have money for one assistant, Marne, so we would have to share you.
Oh, yes. Don't worry. I'm used to high-pressured environments.
I like action. To me, it's all about time management.
I know you're juggling three or four cases at once, and it's my job to help catch any balls that get dropped.
I love your boots. Where did you get them?
Oh, why thank you. I got them at Saks Fifth Avenue. They have a sale now, and you can't believe the options.
isn't she great? - Oh, yes.
so, should I make it happen?
well, actually, let's bring in a few more people. I'll make some calls.
sure, but we should do this like voir dire or something. Three peremptory challenges, you know.
Hey, did you hear about the rumors? Stern is retiring.
our Stern? - Yeah. We'll just be Lockhart, Gardner.
I saw this happen at my dad's firm two partners losing a third. It was like Dawn of the Dead.
people fighting over turf. Junior associates lining up against each other.
not us? - Oh, hey, I won't if you won't.
we have such a good working relationship.
they're still on the Lakeshore crash? I thought we settled that already .Nope. Today
that is our train.
it crashed. Your clients crashed it.
do I need to use simpler sentences?
Yes, Patti. Please. I love it when you patronize me.
cross National Freight entrusted your clients to drive our train.
they drove it too fast. They derailed it, causing millions in damage.
luckily, it was a freight train and nobody died.
except our clients.
we should be suing you, and not you us.
except for this nagging little problem, Patti.
that your company overworked my clients with double-digit shifts and 18-hour days.
Oh, yes, the sexy overtime evidence. Juries love that.
except for the fact that my clients are heroes.
except... - Yes?
except for the fact that these three men stayed with your train to keep it from crashing into a residential neighborhood, saving untold lives.
untold. I love untold. - My bet is a jury will, too.
will. We're not picking a jury tomorrow.
judge Parks is a pro-business constructionist who detests nuisance lawsuits as much as I do.
he's going to grant my motion to dismiss, and you know it.
and I know you know it. So what do you want?
make me an offer.
damn it, Alicia, I thought I said 3: 00.
I'm sorry. - I love watching you, Will.
it's like Shakespeare in the Park. - This is awkward.
I tried to keep it so that you wouldn't cross paths with the widows.
Heartstrings-- ouch, ouch-- being tugged.
what time is their 60 Minutes interview? - 5: 00.
we may not need a jury.
but, hey, what do I know? It's just 60 Minutes.
we know how much they love high-powered executives and hate grieving widows, right?
Mr. Harkin, I'm putting you on speaker.
uh, yeah, fine.
even though it is my belief that we would win a countersuit against your clients for negligence, we are willing to pay out their pensions for ten years.
Ten?! You kidding? Does it come with double coupons?
are you comfortable with that, Mr. Harkin?
no. 80 cents on the dollar.
you know, Sir, these widows are having trouble paying their rent. - What?!
one of them is about to lose their house. She has three children.
what? Who is that?
I'll get him up to a dollar.
you get them to agree.
Ooh, I have yoga in half an hour.
after that, this deal is dead.
their pension for ten years?
it's a come-out offer.- Anything?
pension for ten years.
how much do we have in this?
partner hours? 82. - Will they take it?
I don't know. I don't think so.
we're bleeding here.
Hey, what was that all about? With Overby?
Oh, Malcolm? You know him? He's an old friend. Just catching up.
so, uh, don't take a lot of time with it. Just do a basic background check.
Malcolm's an old friend.
what am I looking for?
stability. Kalinda, one last thing.
I need you to keep this confidential.
I'll be splitting time with Cross National Freight. I'm not sure that's possible.
well, if Will asks, just say I'm having you do work on Sheffrin-Marks.
I want an apology.
they worked my... our husbands to death.
they tried to blame them for this accident, and now they want to pay ten years on their pensions?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Underwood.
I don't want you to apologize. I want them to apologize.
they don't apologize. Money is their apology.
well, I guess then they must not be very sorry.
I think we should take it.
I-I... I need the money.
I'm a month away from sleeping in my car.
my kids-- they still cry for their dad at night.
look at these bills. I... They're not even paying John's overtime.
because they want to starve us into a settlement.
let me talk to her again, see what they come back with.
but I think we all know we're in the endgame here.
so, you've lost faith?
I believe Cross National Freight overworked your husbands to the point of exhaustion.
I believe that's why the train crashed, but I can't prove it.
and they can prove the train was moving too fast.
I'm sorry, Linda.
so, you still want these, denial of overtime claims?
Yes. Everything you have.
we're trying to build to a... - What?
would you just give me a moment?
Alicia, this offer is walking out the door in ten minutes.
what?
this is the memo in our discovery.
this is the same memo sent to our clients.
they left off three names.
you can go to yoga now. We'll see you in court.
the bottom line is Cross National Freight deliberately denied us discovery by concealing Mr. Merriman - and two other department heads. - Your Honor, no one has been denied discovery here.
if names were left off documents, it was inadvertent.
Inadvertent? Is that what they're calling Wite-Out these days?
your Honor, that is just...
I'm sorry, but I find Mr. Gardener's charges personally offensive.
Mr. Merriman and these other two people have nothing to do with overtime.
then why were they CC'd on a letter denying it?
Mr. Gardner, you don't have enough here to convince a jury.
your Honor, with all due respect... - Don't all due respect me, Counselor.
I'm not your high school gym teacher.
on the other hand, Ms. Nyholm-- inadvertent, my ass.
Mr. Gardner, how long would it take to depose these witnesses?
to properly prepare and depose, I would say one month.
you have three days. - Three?
but, Your Honor, that isn't... - Now you have two days.
want to try for one? - No, thank you, Your Honor.
your Honor, if I could just interject here.
these executives are very busy people. Even two hours out of their work day...
ms. Nyholm, you just gave Mr. Gardner back his third day.
would you like to give him a fourth?
no, Your Honor. I'll stop.
good. We'll meet back here on Friday to decide whether a dismissal is in order.
does anybody have anything to say?
okay. Next case.
next on docket... - Cancel everything.
for the next 72 hours, we eat, drink and sleep this case.
I wanted to bring you a birthday cake.
how's everything at home, Mom? - Good.
she's working too much, but that's about it.
Alicia? - What did I say?
every time you refer to Alicia, you say "she"" - Do I?
Alicia came home last night at midnight, left this morning at 6: 00.
I warned her about Diane Lockhart.
no, no, it's the other one, Will Gardner.
I mean, I'm glad they're friends and all, but he needs to give her a break.
day and night, she never stops.
okay, so the goal is this. I'll depose Merriman.
he's the VP of Operations. That's who I think Patti's hiding from us.
the other two-- what are their names?
jonathan Eldredge and Sarah Conley.
he's a systems engineer, and she's in industry relations.
okay, whatever you do, just keep the depose going.
just keep asking questions so Judge Parks doesn't pull the plug on this.
hopefully, I draw enough blood with Merriman, they'll up their offer.
remember, the point isn't to go back to court.
the point is to get them to open their wallets further.
and you're a mechanical systems manager.
is that correct, Mr. Eldredge? - Yes.
and this says that you ordered a new public-address system for passenger cars.
could you explain? - Standard upgrade.
and this says you authorized a new coupling mechanism.
is that right? - Yes. Standard upgrade.
and this says-- let's see-- that you replaced the automated LRS, - "Load Regulator System." - Standard upgrade.
your rail traffic has doubled in the last decade, but you've cut your crews in half, correct?
there's more automated equipment. Trains are easier to drive.
and yet it still takes the same amount of time to drive them.
let the record reflect that Mr. Merriman shrugged.
let the record reflect, I shrugged, too.
so, Ms. Conley, you're saying you have nothing to do with approving or denying overtime?
that's right. - And what about David Merriman?
has he ever approved or denied overtime? - I don't recall.
did any of the accident victims work overtime the week before the Lakeshore crash?
I don't recall. - Did any of them routinely put in for overtime?
I don't recall. - Ms. Conley, are you married?
I don't re... - Oh, I'm so sorry, Ms. Conley.
I've got three clients who lost their husbands-- must have been a Freudian slip.
the truth is, these three employees had gone 24 hours without rest when this accident occurred.
no, no, they work hard, sure, but... - You worked them hard, didn't you?
I did my job, Mr. Gardner.
and what was your job, Mr. Merriman? Tell us.
we pay these people well-- we expect results.
you're a lawyer, you work people hard here at your firm? You bet your ass you do.
this is America. You work hard, get the job done, whatever it takes.
I think we should take a break.
definitely.
let Mr. Merriman recompose himself.
this guy is a walking disaster.
no wonder they hid him from us.
you should've seen Patti. She looked like she was ready to give birth right there.
how'd yours go?
well, I know more about trains than I ever wanted.
just keep it going. Patti's on the phone with her overlords trying to up the offer.
if she does, can you get the widows on the line?
Yeah, Linda said she'd stay by the phone. - Thanks.
you kept them together. I know that hasn't easy.
Oh, I didn't do anything.
you can just tell us the number, Patti.
have you ever known a fishing expedition to be free, Will?
three more days for discovery-- that went both ways.
Oh, come on. Our clients passed every company drug test...
Yes, but this wasn't the company's.
this was part of Underwood's application to renew his health insurance, a week before the crash.
amphetamines? That's right. Your client was on speed.
when I was first starting out, I,uh, I got a terrific piece of advice, and it's always stuck with me and this is it:
everything that happens in a courtroom... - Who did you say he was again?
Yeah, I think I've heard of him.
back in the time of Clarence Darrow, it was a common practice for people to smoke in the courtroom.
so, do you work with him?
currently.
rumor is he might be going to another firm.
I just hope he takes me with him.
...Cuban cigar and he starts smoking... Sorry.
would you excuse me?
it's my mother. I'll be right back.
what's up? - Cross National is throwing an insurance drug test at us for Underwood. Could you check it out?
sure, but tomorrow.
uh, what? Why? What's up?
Diane's asked me to do further work on Sheffrin-Marks.
she what?
I've gotta go.
I can tell from your face, it's not good.
the company has a drug test.
it says Jimmy had amphetamines in his system.
for the longest time I didn't think there was evil.
I just thought there were people who did good and bad things.
but now...
sorry.
that's the kind of conversation Jimmy and I would have.
Linda, I have to ask, did you know about this?
Alicia, Jimmy never did drugs.
there's nothing to know about.
go through your medicine cabinet.
bring me every pill Jimmy's ever taken, every pill he could've accidentally taken of yours. Could you do that?
are we gonna win?
we're gonna fight.
judge may exclude drug test if there's been a violation of testing procedure.
judge Parks would rather eat his own foot than offer us relief on that.
Kalinda have any leads?
I... No. She's doing something with Diane.
for Diane? What?
something for Sheffrin-Marks.
what?
we've got a power vacuum here.
it makes people do... interesting things.
did she say anything about Malcolm Overby?
no.
well, I'm giving up on law anyway.
I'm sick of it.
back to the minors?
I could've been a contender.
I liked watching you pitch.
Yeah, I had some moments.
we're the last ones here. - Yep.
I should go. - Yeah. Me, too.
yeah? - Yeah, Mr. Gardener.
there's a woman down here who insists on seeing Mrs. Florrick.
Oh, Ms. Conley, did you forget something?
I'm not here. I have a family. I can't get messed up in this.
okay. Let's talk.
no. It's wrong what they're doing.
blaming them with that drug test. Blaming them for something they...
something they...?
Newbury Heights.
wait. What? - Newbury Heights. I don't know what you mean. Find out.
is that your toy?
what is that?
is that your toy?
is that what it is?
how old?
Oh, I'm so stupid.
I should've just shut up. I should've just kept walking.
but that would've been wrong.
I thought you'd be different.
I thought after what you went through... with your family...
and you come here to my house? - I'm sorry.
then go. - I can't.
there are three mothers who are widows now, Mrs. Conley... - It's not my fault.
but it's somebody's fault.
what do you want?
I looked into Newbury Heights.
I couldn't find anything. I went back 50 years.
there's never been an accident there.
it wasn't an accident.
it was a near miss.
and it wasn't one of our trains.
right. Coming into Newbury Heights, there's a nine degree curve.
that's where we jumped the track.
just managed to get the brake on before we hit the commuter train.
did anyone from your company ever identify the problem?
sure. Sure. They identified me.
said I was going too fast.
but the speed gauge never went above 32 mph.
I thought it was mechanical. Maybe a faulty pressure sensor.
isn't the pressure sensor part of the load regulator sensor?
trains, you know. Love them.
so, if you upgraded the LRS, wouldn't you have to replace the pressure sensor, too?
Yeah. Fact is, that's what they did, after the near miss, they upgraded the LRS.
standard upgrade.
we've been going after the wrong thing-- overtime records and not faulty equipment.
they erased those memos not to hide Merriman, but the structural engineer, our buddy Eldredge.
if we can prove he was at Newbury Heights... - Yep.
previous knowledge. We'll have a case even Judge Parks can't kick.
here's the deal: We can't let Patti know we're changing strategies.
I'll keep deposing Merriman. You re-depose Eldredge. Be ready in ten minutes.
okay.
I think I have someone you'll be more comfortable with.
worked 19 years as an assistant.
we called them secretaries in my day.
and are you comfortable with online research, Mrs. Plack?
online? Oh, yeah, everything's computers nowadays.
don't worry, I'm a quick study.
Hey, I like your hair this way.
Yeah, I do.
it looked so dowdy on TV, pulled back like that.
but that must've been a hard day, huh?
what's the smoking policy here, anyway? - What? I thought you two would have a lot in common.
that does not count as a preemptory.
Oh, Mr. Merriman's is upstairs.
Yes, I thought I'd sit in on this one today. Get to know you better.
great. Please.
actually... chairs aren't really my friends these days.
I think I'll just stand.
so you're Will's new one?
Yes. I'm his new junior associate.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
the way he looks at you: that's what I meant.
I guess he finds you a challenge.
too many blond gigglers, and why not go for someone more substantial, someone with interesting history.
Mrs. Nyholm.
I know how this works-- we're going to try and get into each other's heads, try and unnerve each other.
can I give you a little bit of advice?
after the past seven months, I'm vaccinated.
fair enough.
let's get started.
Mr. Eldredge, two months before the Lakeshore crash, you authorized an upgrade of the load regulator system on all Cross National Freight trains.
can you explain why? - There wasn't just one reason.
it was a change we'd planned for some time.
and what about the LRS in the train that crashed, did you replace that one?
I don't believe we did.
the-the upgrade takes some time, and we couldn't have all of our engines out of commission at once.
I understand that. Tell me about Newbury Heights, Mr. Eldredge?
what?
tell me about it.
it's, uh... I don't know what you mean.
june 21, you went to Newbury Heights to check out a near miss collision, isn't that right?
would you like to take a break?
if you were to learn there was a problem with a piece of equipment on your trains, - Mr. Eldredge, you'd replace the part, wouldn't you? - Of course I would.
and you'd make sure that no trains were operating with unsafe equipment?
look, I know what you're thinking. - No, you don't.
I never once... - My apologies.
a... a pang.
we're gonna have to break this off here.
Oh, come on. Objection.
let the record reflect deposition was suspended for medical reasons.
and again, I-I apologize. Mr. Eldredge.
sorry. - It's okay.
Hi, Jackie. It's me. I saw that you called.
please obey all commands and follow instructions. Please obey all commands and follow instructions.
dad. Dad
it's you!
I... I missed you. - I know.
grace. - Go to him.
grace. - Happy Birthday, Dad.
so, you still a fish or what?
Yep, still a fish. Just like in Oz.
they do shakedowns every day?
your Honor, Will Gardner. This is my third message.
defense counsel's interrupted deposition for the day and we...
damn it.
he's lying. - What?
he knew exactly what Newbury Heights was. He said he was in the office all day.
but you have to swipe that every time you exit and enter.
which means we can tell exactly what time he came and went.
I can't get the judge on the phone, but if I hurry, I'll catch him. - What are you doing?
getting a court order for Cross National Freight's security records.
find Kalinda, tell her to meet me down at the courthouse.
Oh, listen, I'll call you about that...
Diane has a boyfriend.
what's the occasion? - Work.
it's just so pretty. - Thank you.
what time did you get in? - Late. You were asleep.
Thanks, by the way. This should be the last late night for a while.
I took Grace and Zach to see Peter.
you did what?
I took Grace and Zach to see their father for his birthday.
Jackie, I-I... I-I'm thunderstruck.
I tried to phone you. - You tried to phone me?
we discussed this.
I was taking them next week.
it worked out perfectly, seeing him. They were perfect.
Jackie. I am their mother.
it is my decision. This of all things is my decision!
I'm sorry. It was spontaneous.
you don't supervise my kids spontaneously.
you don't take them to prison. You don't just try and phone me.
you phone me. You respect me as a mother or you leave.
I am doing the best I can.
well, join the club.
Overby's firm is well capitalized, excellent client base, no ethics charges, no bankruptcies, no judgments.
but are you sure that's what you're looking for?
I... don't know. Should I be looking for something else?
well, that's like asking a dentist whether you should brush.
see what you can find out. And, Kalinda, again, this is just between you and me.
you understand? - Yeah.
do you know how much you pay jury consultants? - No.
$100, 000 for three months work.
that sounds about right.
do you know how much I make?
I have a feeling I'm finding out.
a fourth of that. - That sounds outrageous.
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
subpoenaed records of security entrances from May to August. - Thanks.
so, Kalinda, can I ask you...
this thing you're doing with Diane, does it have anything to do with Malcolm Overby?
no. - It doesn't?
no, you can't ask me.
it's just... If he's coming on as a third partner, Will should know.
you can't ask me and I can't tell you but don't conclude from what I'm saying it's what you think.
okay. Can you be any more specific? - No.
wait, here's the date, June 21.
it would take him about two hours to get out to Newbury Heights.
he leaves the office at 6: 42 p. m.and he comes back... - An hour later.
that's not enough time.
what about the next day?
same thing. 9:48 p. m.comes back at 10: 33 p. m.
wait. That's someone else.
Oh, you're right. That's Sarah Conley.
Oh, here he is.
Eldredge... he left and came back a few minutes later.
that's interesting.
what? - Look.
see, here it is again.
Sarah Conley leaves within a few minutes of Eldredge, she comes back a few minutes after him.
same here, 9:30 p. m.
me, too... 8: 45 p. m.
and on August 5, the night of the Lakeshore crash, same thing.
they're always the last two working together at night.
Yeah, well, so are we.
Yeah, but they're leaving and returning within a few minutes of each other on foot.
and you know what's across from their building?
the Stanford Plaza Hotel.
I think they were having an affair.
jonathan Eldredge is denying everything.
that's not my problem.
all the nights you went to the hotel with him across the street, that is your problem.
Oh, my God.
Sarah, I don't care about your personal life. That's your business.
all I care about is what he said to you the night of the accident, that's all.
he wanted to talk; he was so upset.
he said he knew for a while there was a problem with the pressure sensor.
he'd been trying to fix it quietly.
Sarah, I need to demonstrate that Eldredge knew about the problem before the accident.
but there's no document, there's no smoking gun, and I don't have the time to find one.
all I've got is you. - I can't testify!
this isn't about the affair, Sarah. This is about the accident.
the only way I know about the accident is because of the affair, and I will have to talk about it.
if I don't, they'll bring it up.
they'll say I'm getting back at him, that I'm bitter. You know how they'll twist this around.
there's no other way.
I'm sorry, hon. Dylan only wants you.
is everything all right? - Yeah, fine.
I love you.
how old did you say Dylan was? - Three months.
it's not just me.
it's my husband, it's my other kids, it's a baby.
they have nothing to do with this, but if you make me testify...
please don't do to me what somebody did to you.
wow, you are really obsessed with him.
not obsessed.
intrigued.
so, is he seeing anyone?
so that's what this is about. You want me to introduce you?
no. I was just... - Introduce whom?
Malcolm Overby.
Kalinda. - Kalinda what?
uh, I'm a lawyer. My firm threw this party.
what do you do?
I crash other people's parties.
so, if I gave you my card, what are the chances you'd use it?
I'd say pretty good.
use it however you want.
so, I take it you have some information.
Yeah. I looked deeper into Mr. Overby, and I don't think he's a good candidate for partnership.
based on my investigation, he appears to be nonexclusive.
Nonexclusive? - In pursuit of other options.
openly in pursuit.
are you sure? - Positive.
the firm can do better.
well, thank you, Kalinda, for your discretion in this matter.
always.
and, Kalinda, let's talk tomorrow about renegotiating your contract.
I'd like that.
this is it.
every pill in our medicine cabinet.
and this... this is a prescription Jimmy got a month before the accident.
it's for allergies.
do you think that could be it?
it could be. The drug test didn't screen for pseudoephedrine.
not in this dosage. Thanks, Linda.
have a good night. - You, too.
was it frightening? - No.
I just... I don't like him in there.
I like seeing Dad in a suit.
Yeah, me, too.
so, you're okay? - Yeah.
I mean, I'm mad at him, but he's still Dad.
what about you? You look sad.
no. It's just this case I'm working on.
might have to do something I don't want to.
something? - You know, like what happened to us.
well, you said "might," Is there another way?
not that I can think of.
well, you're a lawyer, right? You have to represent your client.
even if it means hurting another family?
well, if you didn't, you'd just hurt your client, right?
you have to do your job.
you can't just not do your job.
so, three days later, and you still have depositions to conduct?
your Honor, Ms. Nyholm stomped out of Mr. Eldredge's deposition two days ago, and we have been constrained with questioning Mrs. Conley and Mr. Eldredge ever since.
as melodramatic as Mr. Gardner's account is, Your Honor,
I think the last time I stomped out of anywhere was the third grade.
unless I've grown bigger than I thought.
uh, we ask, Your Honor, for an open deposition, so that you may rule...
they're going to force her to testify in open court?
if she denies the affair, they'll accuse her of perjury.
then, everything she says in court will get thrown out.
who are yosing?
ms. Sarah Conley, Your Honor.
please don't do this. - I'm so sorry.
Mrs. Conley, what did Mr. Jonathan Eldredge tell you on the night of August 5, - a few hours after the Lakeshore crash? - Objection, Your Honor.
no foundation. Ms. Florrick has yet to establish access.
your Honor, do we need to establish access? They work in the same company.
but in vastly different departments.
sustained.
ms. Conley, where were you on the evening of August 5 after the Lakeshore crash?
I was in a hotel room downtown.
were you alone?
no. I was with Jonathan Eldredge.
Mr. Harkin, can... can you hear us?
no, no, that's good enough.
where is your assistant? - I don't know. She quit.
it's very hard to find a good assistant these days.
Mr. Harkin, I'm going to make our final offer now.
go ahead.
I think you can see this meets all of your demands and then some.
under one condition: that we don't go to trial.
I think we can handle that. - There is one other thing.
they want an apology.
excuse me? - Fine.
Mr. Harkin?
just settle this thing, will you?
well, Patti... it's always a pleasure.
Yep. - Until next time.
Mrs. Florrick.
excuse me. You got a minute? - Sure.
this one looks pretty good, and if you don't like this one,
I think we need to start looking at the new crop of Ivy Leaguers.
Courtney, this is Alicia Florrick.
I didn't expect you.
spur of the moment. Sorry I missed your birthday.
the kids said the visit went well.
Yeah, they... they look great.
Zach's almost as tall as I am.
three months, then suddenly, boom.
so, um... Mom tells me you're working on a hard case.
Yep.
I guess you're putting in a lot of hours with Will.
a lot of time to think about things in here.
a lot of time out there, too.
he's not what he seems, Alicia.
Peter, if it's one thing I'm learning... nobody is.
Gardner acts like he's this good guy and he's everybody's best friend, but I could tell you a few things about him.
what?
can we... Can we at least acknowledge how ironic this conversation is?
I love you.
I was thinking about our apartment on 81st Street.
remember? No air-conditioning.
it was so hot you'd... you'd run around in that T-shirt you got from the Mexican restaurant below.
all I could think was, God, you were the most beautiful woman in the world.
then? - No.
then and now.
I don't want to lose you. I don't know what happened. I lost my way. I...
I got on a power trip. - Don't.
don't blame it on that. - I'm sorry.
no, it's me.
I understand. I understand.
but don't give up on me.
it's nothing.
what do you mean, it's nothing?
look at 'em.
I am looking at them. It's a financial meeting.
that's how they look in a financial meeting.
no, that's how they look when they're cutting jobs.
come on, law firms aren't recession-proof the way they used to be.
would you stop scaring yourself?
they said billable hours are up this year.
they said we're fine.
and tax litigation? We have six full-time.
all right, let's cut four and hold on to two.
which four?
his wife is pregnant. - He doesn't have seniority.
see if he'll do part-time.
and the junior associates?
let's put a pin in that.
we don't have many pins left. - Diane.
Oh, better late than never. - What, Stern?
the great man makes an appearance.
Jonas, how are you? We need to run some names by you for layoffs.
where are you? It sounds loud.
Alicia, do you have a second?
sure.
it's not like law school, is it?
it's better. I always felt unsure in law school.
Really?
could have fooled me.
I did fool you.
so I have a favor to ask you.
you never met Mr. Stern. - No, he's been away.
right, Bali and the Barrier Reef.
anyway, he has a daughter-- Anna-- from his first marriage.
she's being sued. I don't know all the details, but I'm sure they're ugly.
last time, we got her out of a drug possession.
the time before that, she drove a car through a department store window.
you don't need to take notes on this. Anna's a real party girl.
her new husband hired some no-name lawyer, and Mr. Stern wants someone from our firm to cocounsel with him.
with this other lawyer? - Yeah. Just make sure he doesn't screw up.
second chair him.
she's meeting with the lawyer in two hours, so take Kalinda and get a lay of the land, okay?
we're going through a lot of changes around here.
there's only three votes that really matter-- mine, Diane's, and Mr. Stern's.
this is a good way to impress Mr. Stern.
Thanks.
whoa, you're not kidding.
Yeah, they were just on our doorstep. Someone rang the doorbell and ran.
Why? - I don't know, I think to scare my mom.
is that... - what, crack?
Yeah, but it's Photoshopped. My dad's not even in the picture.
why do all the cool things happen to you?
- No, it's somebody else.
here.
what's the password for the parental controls?
I don't have parental controls.
my mom trusts me .You're kidding.
this is so great.
what are you doing? - 39, 000 matches.
that's crazy. - That's a start.
you must be 18 years or older to access Sweet...
aren't you glad you have a friend like me to help you with a tough chore like this?
no.
this is going to take forever or something.
stern's daughter lives here?
maybe we have the wrong address.
or maybe there's a methadone clinic near here.
excuse me.
are you looking for me?
actually, we're... Are you...?
I'm Anna, Jonas Stern's daughter.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
don't worry, I get that a lot. This is me now.
I was in rehab out in Westchester, and there was this volunteer there, a yeshiva student, and he had this amazing LP collection.
and so you went Orthodox?
Hey, they were good LPs.
was talking about passion and music and the Torah, and I just...
I fell in love.
that's the problem with love-- you can't make it do what you want.
so... what happened?
well, a lady tripped in front of our house and she's suing us.
we have homeowner's insurance, but it only covers the $20, 000 in compensatory damages, not the punitive.
how much is the punitive?
$1. 2 million.
she's suing you for $1. 2 million? - Yes.
it'll take everything we own and our future.
just when yothu nd your place in life, here comes this.
sorry, I can't do this during the Sabbath.
it's work.
and what about your dad-- can he help?
we don't want it.
we're not in touch with him.
Yeah. Last year she was club-hopping with Tara Reid.
do you know what she doing next year?
club-hopping with Tara Reid.
does anyone ever surprise you?
no.
even me? - Especially you.
sorry, Anna probably told you, we've already hired a lawyer.
he did work for my brother on a foreclosure, and he's very good, but, um, thank you.
isaac, could you just tell us what happened?
are you Jewish?
is that important?
to understand what happened, yes.
it's important to be Jewish to understand a slip and fall?
this slip and fall, yes.
I'm sorry you came all this way, Mrs...?
you're...?
he put the skin heads away.
how's he doing?
it's an eruv wire.
a what? - Eruv wire.
like carrying a baby or groceries in a community's courtyard.
but there are no courtyards these days so the eruv wire creates a symbolic courtyard for the whole neighborhood.
and this eruv wire fell?
Yes, from there.
isn't it the responsibility of the community?
no, it's on our property.
so... someone tripped over this wire and now she's suing you for $1. 2 million.
I feel like I'm missing something.
willful and wanton conduct.
Ryan, there you are.
this is the other lawyer Anna mentioned.
we were just discussing the suit.
our firm feels that it could offer you some assistance.
odd, I didn't know I needed some... assistance.
Mr. and Mrs. Loeb, could you give us a moment to talk?
Yes, yes, please.
Ryan, if you could make this work, we'd prefer that.
and Mrs. Florrick, next time you see your husband, please tell him how much he is appreciated.
so I do the depositions, the pretrial motions, prep for next week's trial, and here comes the 600-pound gorilla.
Yep, that's me, 600 pounds.
did you read the brief? - Nope.
talk to the plaintiff? - Nope.
came on this case two hours ago.
our firm is doing it as a favor to Mrs. Loeb.
why willful and...?
Hey, I was put on this case.
it's not my choice and I really don't care if it's your choice.
you call it a 600-pound gorilla or whatever you want, but now I'm your second chair.
they saw the eruv wire was down, they knew it could trip somebody up, and they didn't try to repair it.
that's why it's willful and wanton conduct and subject to high punitive damages.
they admitted to that?
in their depositions.
and why would they admit to that?
the wire fell on the Sabbath.
they couldn't do anything.
Yeah, it's the perfect legal trap.
they're liable because their religion wouldn't let them act. - And your defense?
my defense is to suggest that you go tell your boss you're meeting regularly with me and I'm doing a great job and let me win this case.
that's not going to happen, Mr. Alprin.
we're in this together.
can't hear you.
you're maintaining that you were injured so badly as to require a large judgment?
I'm maintaining that I have pain every single day.
I-I try to ignore it.
I try to pick up my little girl, but I can't.
it keeps me from pushing her on a swing.
it keeps me from playing with her on the floor.
and this grocery store was a half mile from your home.
why did you pass up five closer grocery stores to go to this one?
my daughter needs gluten-free foods and, uh, this grocery store
the kosher grocery store-- had more options.
good answer. - After you fell, how much time passed...?
great answer.
anything to undercut the injury testimony?
I'm still checking.
I mean, as far as I can tell, nobody witnessed her fall, but I'm checking with first responders.
any word from your cocounsel?
no, our friend Mr. Alprin doesn't pick up his phone.
this one's a tough one.
the jury's gonna love her.
and you're dealing with sympathy issues.
is that a euphemism for something?
anti-semitism.
we'll deal with that in voir dire.
wonder what those questions will sound like.
do you dislike Jews?
you're a bundle of fun today. - You're kidding me!
layoffs.
Hi, I'm Katarina.
and I am so excited to chat with you.
you must be 18 or older to chat and please have your credit card ready.
and as if life wasn't full enough.
Mr. Alprin...
so, I asked for a continuance until Monday morning because Vice cops like to sleep in, so don't fail to show up in court, okay?
if you don't show up, you're going to have to take a plea.
Alprin & Associates.
I thought you were taking away his keys, Mrs. Frazzi.
okay, the arraignment won't be until 3: 00.
I'll see you there.
okay, you let me know when you can talk.
I'll just... sit here and wait.
so... Mrs. Florrick.
Mrs. Peter Florrick. Right here in my office. - Yep.
dressing up as a peasant and walking amongst the serfs.
that's me. So this is what idealism looks like.
I liked your husband.
he was better than this current state's attorney.
easier on DUIs and drug cases.
so, here's your problem.
you've got a client who admitted to liability, and a sympathetic plaintiff.
you saw the depositions?
got them from the plaintiff's attorney.
you wouldn't answer your phone.
the only play I see is you attack the medical evidence, and try to reduce the punitive amount.
what do you think of the First Amendment? - I like it.
isaac and Anna's religion requires they not act on the fallen eruv wire, because it's the Sabbath.
therefore they can't be held liable for not acting.
you want to use the First Amendment to attack a slip and fall?
they believed God would judge them if they acted, so they couldn't act.
and what about OSHA v. Smith? - OSHA v. Smith can kiss my ass.
liability is outweighed by the Loebs' right to exercise their religion.
up to what point?
if they saw someone dying outside... - Well, yes, when that happens, I will call on you, Mrs. Florrick.
but you're creating a loophole in liability law.
no. The Constitution is.
how long were you married?
15 years, and don't do that. - What?
throw a personal question into the middle of an intellectual argument.
it gets more honest answers.
judges in civil courts crave two things: novelty and getting out of civil court.
the First Amendment is novel.
we'd have to put a First Amendment scholar on the stand.
I was about to make calls.
give me half.
how can you work there?
how can I work where? What are we talking about now?
stern, Lockhart & Gardner.
Oh, right. The big bad corporate overlords.
much better to work in a storefront, fighting for DUIs and prostitutes.
two years ago, I had a case of lead poisoning in toys.
Benny Brauer. Eight months old.
fell into a coma after sucking on a crib mobile.
the insurance company offered to settle until your firm got involved.
isn't the point of representing clients to help them win?
meet me in open court, I'll beat you every time.
that's not what your firm did.
you buried us in paper, continuances, trial motions waiting for Benny Brauer to die.
a week later, I heard your chief litigator had a name for it.
litigating the margins.
delaying the reward to exhaust the opposition and therefore reduce the payout.
we do pro bonos. We do death row cases.
you can't tarnish an entire firm based on one case.
sure you can.
especially when one of the partners was the chief litigator.
just give me one second, all right?
so, Stern called for an update on his daughter's case, and he sent you something.
me? - Well, whoever we put on the case.
he's in Bora-Bora.
Thanks.
so, how's it going?
good.
we're going for a First Amendment defense.
on a slip and fall?
religious freedom trumps liability.
smart.
maybe I'll sneak into court, and see how it's going. How's the cochair?
he's... interesting.
interesting is good.
he was saying some things.
yeah? What?
nothing. Another time.
look, here's my take on it.
we're too low on the totem pole to get fired because we don't cost enough.
the problem is these older people.
I don't mean that in a generational sense.
I just mean, you know, the ones who have been here longer.
Thanks. - They're not hungry enough, you know?
and they cost too much.
Cary, have you ever heard of a case here defending a toy company against lead poisoning?
no. Why, should we be on it?
no, no, it was two years ago. The kid died when we didn't settle.
two years ago? Why are we talking about something that happened two years ago?
how's homework going?
done.
what've you been up to?
nothing. Homework.
Oh, Grandma left her wallet again.
can you put it by the door so she doesn't forget it next time?
sure.
is a purely volunteer policing force for the Hasidim.
mostly we deal with hate crimes.
and you were the first responders on the scene?
Yeah, right here. Lady was on her back, screaming.
on her back? But she fell forward.
Yeah, and then she rolled on her back.
there was a lot of broken glass in her groceries.
that camera seems to have a direct view.
it was put in before the lady fell, but wasn't hooked up till after.
Oh... it's unlucky, yeah?
just happened like that.
you know with all the hate crimes around here, we have almost every square yard of this block covered by cameras.
can I ask a favor, Ezra?
could you stand here for a minute where Dawn fell?
sure.
okay, hold up, hold up.
so, Mr. Alprin, let me get this straight.
you intend to argue a slip and fall as a First Amendment issue?
Yes, Your Honor. - This is ridiculous, Your Honor.
they can't even keep a straight face.
in Kolatch v. Harper, 1983, Your Honor, it was argued, the Constitution can't be segregated from peripheral areas of law.
Kolatch v. Harper?
you can't just bring up some two-bit case from 1983 as a citing.
that was actually a one-bit case.
it was my first one as a litigator.
and as I remember it, I lost that case.
Yes, sir, but it was still a good argument.
your Honor, shouldn't a jury be allowed to decide?
Yes, that's what I argued then.
attorney: Your Honor, this is about liability.
this is not about the Constitution.
counselor, everything's about the Constitution.
life rarely gives you a chance to reverse a past regret.
so, what the hell?
let's let the jury decide.
step back.
Oh, and, Mr. Abbott, you may call your first witness.
so, when you installed the wire a year ago, you warned the Loebs about maintenance?
Yeah, I did.
I always recommend that I be called once a month to maintain and inspect.
and how often did the Loebs phone you after you installed it?
zero.
thank you, Mr. Knox. No more questions, Your Honor.
Mr. Alprin?
good morning, Mr. Knox. - Good morning.
every time a customer phones you for maintenance, you make money, correct?
that's not why I ask them to.
you ask customers to phone you once a month not because your work is shoddy? - No.
because that would mean you'd liable in this case, too, if your work was shoddy.
objection. - Sustained.
when was the last time you were sued for shoddy workmanship, Mr. Knox?
well, I've never been sued.
and have you ever been served?
I guess I might have.
isn't it true that the plaintiff in this case tried to sue you for the shoddy workmanship at the Loeb house, - Objection.
and it was until you agreed-- with a proverbial gun to your head
to testify for the plaintiff... - Your Honor, objection!
Mr. Abbott, the question hasn't been asked yet.
wasn't it only when you agreed to testify against the Loebs that the lovely Mr. Abbott over here agreed to drop the lawsuit against you?
go ahead, you can object now.
objection, Your Honor. - Overruled.
you're making this sound bad.
well, then, help me make it sound good.
you did shoddy construction, connecting the eruv wire, - you got sued, and then you tried to blame the customer for... - Misstates the facts!-Objection!
to avoid a lawsuit yourself. Help me make that sound good.
your Honor, objection.
withdrawn.
your witness.
nice cross. - Thanks.
where did you go to school?
so we're getting intimate now?
Yes, school talk. Very personal.
samford University.
stanford, really?
no, Samford. Cumberland.
ranked in the top 133 of law schools.
I make up in passion what I lack in law books.
you're good.
so, you can't use any machinery during the Sabbath, because God would disapprove?
Yes.
so that's why you couldn't call about the eruv wire being down, because that would be operating machinery?
Yes. - Okay. I think I get it.
what's he got? - Mrs. Loeb, this is a record of your cell phone bill.
if you could look at the underlined item there.
there's a phone call you made at 9: 33 p. m.on what day?
would you read that?
september fourth?
Yes, what day was that? What day of the week?
Mrs. Loeb.
Friday.
that would be the Sabbath?
you... made a phone call on the Sabbath?
I... I'm...
Yes.
Abbott: And this was a call to?
to my father. We've been estranged, and I...
and you called at night on your cell, so your husband wouldn't find out about it.
is that right?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
you did the same thing on August 7, and July 17, and June 19.
is this correct?
other Fridays?
so, Mrs. Loeb, you could have called about the eruv wire being down, but you chose not to...
...Thus, making you liable.
no further questions.
I understand it.
I understand her wanting to phone her father.
it's a betrayal.
it's a weakness.
was what happened with your husband a weakness?
that's different.
how is it different?
she didn't cheat on you.
she lied to me.
she... betrayed... everything.
but it wasn't selfish.
have you forgiven your husband?
then how can you tell me to forgive?
Hey, I'll get back to you.
they want to talk settlement.
they know we've lost our First Amendment argument, now they want to pick our pockets.
we don't have a lot of options.
KATARINA: And you're really 18?
Yes.
and what do you look like, Zach?
can I ask you a question?
you can ask me anything you want.
I think I have a picture of you.
it's-it's of you and a man in... it looks like a hotel room.
KATARINA: What am I wearing?
a black bra. - But you sound so sexy.
no, I don't. - Yes, you do.
your voice is so... It makes me want to do things.
Katarina, listen, I'm paying you so I can ask you something serious.
somebody took photos of you in a hotel room, and you're using drugs.
and... I need to know who took the pictures.
kid, look, I'm not Katarina.
Yeah, I saw him in court. I like him.
it's like we were, out of a law school-- hungry. Is he with some firm?
no. He's coming here, actually, for that settlement conference.
aren't we laying people off?
Yeah, but we need some new blood.
litigators who can do the job of two, you know?
you've met him before. - Who?
Ryan Alprin. That case involving lead poisoning in toys?
Oh, right, from two years ago.
he was on the other side. - The losing side.
so, what, he holds a grudge? - Thinks we buried him.
I'm sure we did. That's how you kill shallow pockets.
litigating for the margins? - Representing your client.
if he was with a bigger firm, might have deeper pockets.
let's talk to him, see if he's interested.
okay.
I better go.
a lot of glass here.
Yes, every time we sell a piece of our soul, we buy glass.
who's that?
my competition.
nice coconut.
Thanks. - Can I have it?
no.
what's our fallback position?
like you said before-- undercut the extent of injuries and try to reduce the award.
Yeah, we're still vulnerable on punitive.
I've gone over the numbers.
we can settle for double compensatory.
why didn't you divorce him?
because I didn't want to.
double compensatory handles the victim's medical, and a bit more.
that's not an answer.
it's the only answer you're getting.
no one asks you?
Ryan, I'm your cocounsel.
I know you think you've got this cute little spontaneous thing going...
this is my take on it. You're a rule-follower.
the way you dress, the way you act.
but there's this part of you that wants freedom.
rule-breaking. Look at who you married, look at, uh...
Ryan, seriously, stop.
you like people who scare you.
the Loeb house, deli, parking lot, park.
there are video cameras here, here, here and here.
this... is what they shot.
now, there's a three-foot clearance between the victim's head and this view.
a two-foot clearance between her feet and this view.
that is either the strangest coincidence in the world, or... - Or a scam.
but she had to know exactly what the cameras saw to avoid being taped.
this view at the deli was obvious, because the cash register was right next to the security screen.
but these cameras-- the park cameras-- their screens aren't on-site.
the only way she could see them was at the security company.
so, you think the victim has a connection there?
we'll settle for one million.
that's unlikely.
I've shown how much the homeowners policy will pay. That's our zone.
no, our zone is what Jonas Stern can pay.
Oh, so that's what this is about? You're targeting Mr. Stern.
we're aware of Mr. Stern.
then you're aware that Mr. Stern is not stepping in on this.
we're in Mr. Stern's office, and you work for Mr. Stern, but he's not stepping in on this?
okay. This was fun.
I have 63 security linkups-- Households, businesses, loading docks.
we DVR everything up to about six months.
do all the employees have access to all these screens?
well, actually, it's just the three of us. What are you looking for?
just covering my bases.
there was a surveillance camera put in right where this trip and fall happened, right?
right, but it wasn't linked up until the next week.
in fact, we rushed it due to that fall.
there. - Oh, yeah.
why rushed?
well, it's kind of dark there at night.
so someone goes there with a cherry picker to put a camera up?
that's right. - And who does that?
I do.
I think we've got our man.
we've got phone records, we've got credit card bills.
Hank was within reach of the eruv wire days before it fell.
this could work. - You want to do cross?
no, you should.
get him to deny connection, and then go for impeachment.
I like working with you.
Yep.
no, I really do.
what?
you shouldn't do this.
do what? - Talk this way.
because you're married?
for a start.
your husband cheated on you.
and so what? What does that mean?
what do you want?
Ryan, I've got two teenage kids and a to-do list you wouldn't believe.
you're not convincing me.
just do the work, okay? Please?
the Loebs are counting on us. Don't make this more difficult.
we're doing this wrong.
probably.
I can't fire another person.
I can't look another one in the eye and say,"You're going to land somewhere," when I know they're not.
what do you propose?
you have a lifeboat that holds 15 people or one person-- who do you put in it?
is one a priest and one a rabbi?
stern costs just as much as 15 litigators, Diane.
you want to make a move against Stern?
I want to save 15 jobs.
stern brought us together.
we're only a firm because of him.
the wedding is over, the minister can go home.
he costs us. He's not what he used to be.
he doesn't bring in any clients.
you know, this would be a whole lot less galling if you were just honest.
there are three votes on this board, and you want to get rid of the one that sides with me.
this is a power play, pure and simple.
get off it, Diane. Nothing here is pure, and nothing here is simple.
this is.
it's going to be hard.
I know. I'm sorry.
I can see, even with the small things, he doesn't trust me.
it's like with my dad after rehab the first time.
he looked at me differently.
like I was a time bomb.
I'm sure he wants it to work.
he does.
you can't just throw a marriage away, can you?
you good?
Mr. Alprin, are you ready?
Yes, Your Honor.
so, you are the owner and operator of Megalith Security. Is that right, sir?
Yes, it is. - And how do you know the plaintiff?
well, I... I don't know her.
you're under oath, and you're saying you don't know her?
Yes, I am.
fair enough.
sir... what's this?
it's a phone bill.
it's your phone bill, correct?
and this number here-- you see that?
that number belongs to the plaintiff.
so, was that a wrong number, sir?
probably. I... I don't know.
and here on this page, did you phone that wrong number three more times?
I don't know.
and this phone call was eight minutes long.
is that typically how long you... talk to a wrong number?
well, I would contest that bill.
and this call of five minutes, and this one of 23 minutes-- would you contest that, as well?
I would.
now, this surveillance camera that you installed near the eruv wire in the week before the...
accident, you were in a cherry picker bucket, right?
up there installing the camera? - Yes.
and that would have put you right in the exact place where the eruv wire attached to the Loeb house?
no, not-not right there.
five feet away?
I don't know.
I didn't measure it. - Well, we did.
so, you were in a position to weaken the eruv wire so that it could fall.
Objection!
Kalinda, I'm in the middle of trial. Can't this wait? - No, it can't.
look, Will was having me look into your cocounsel.
what? - He was thinking of hiring him. It's a standard operating procedure.
okay. - I'm on with a friend from the bar association.
they can't find his bar number.
what? Why?
because he's not a lawyer.
Ryan Alprin went to law school, but failed his bar exam and never took it a second time.
they can't find his bar association number.
how is that even possible?
the system is based on trust more than we think.
but he's up there right now cross-examining. Yeah, I'm still here.
he's winning this case.
this is not just about the case.
he'll be arrested-- this is a state crime-- and you could be disbarred if you don't take this to the judge.
if I know he's not a lawyer.
which you'll know in two minutes.
once the jury starts deliberating, the verdict stands.
Yeah, but we need to... - Okay. We're winning this case.
the Loebs need us to win this case.
I'm not going to let Ryan... I need you to take a walk around the block.
what?
I need you to take a walk around the block now, and we'll talk later.
wait. I want to be clear.
you want me not to be here when I get this information?
we are minutes away from sending this to a jury, so go for a walk.
so, you're saying, sir, you're not connected to the plaintiff, and yet you had access to the eruv wire just days before it fell, you control the placement and view of your surveillance cameras, and you phoned the plaintiff three times in the week before the accident?
I don't know about any of this.
so, the documentation is lying?
all these phone records, all these bills... - Stop.
what?
you're resting the defense right now.
I'm not... - I know you're not a lawyer.
and I'm not going to let you endanger this case.
Mr. Alprin?
the defense rests, Your Honor.
this is what you're going to do.
after jury instructions, you turn yourself in, or I'm going to the judge.
this is all a mistake.
don't. I mean it.
I'm sorry.
no, this isn't one of those "sorry" things.
you turn yourself in, or I will.
BAILIFF: All rise.
judge: Madam Foreperson, have you reached a verdict?
Yes, we have, Your Honor.
how do you find?
we find for the defense.
thank you, jurors, for your services.
you are dismissed.
yeah? - Just quickly.
uh, this lawyer, Ryan-- I think I made a mistake.
what do you mean?
I mean... I don't think he's right for us.
okay. I got it. Thanks.
Hey, it's me. Look, the law is the only thing I'm good at.
it's the only thing I've ever been good at.
I made a mistake, and I'm going to fix it.
I just, uh... Alicia...
I wanted to say to you...
Zach, who were you talking to last night?
uh, no one. - Jackie picked up the extension, Zach.
she said you were on the phone with someone.
who was it?
look at me. Who was it?
you wouldn't understand.
well, I may or I may not, but you're going to tell me anyway.
I phoned a sex line.
I was curious.
I won't do it again.
mom, I said I'm not going to do it again.
I know.
I can't stop what goes on out there, but in here, we tell each other the truth.
that is the truth.
you're sure? There's nothing else you want to tell me?
no. Why?
I release about your husband - a lot more.
disturbing things. I was holding back.
do we tell Mom?
they sent them to hurt her, so I say no.
you're three months into a ten-year sentence, and you're plotting a political comeback.
politics is just a game of Chutes and Ladders.
Alicia, um, we... we need you to do something that we didn't expect.
will you testify?
Mrs. Florrick?
sorry to keep you waiting. We had to move them.
I put them in the jury holding room.
I've sent people to prison, a lot of people, actually, and I'd do it again.
but I do wish that every prosecutor had my experience of walking in a convict's shoes.
well, you must've seen the articles or heard the rumblings.
with crime rates up and disappointment in your successor rising, the voters seem to want you back.
well, Russ, I'll always remember what my dad told me.
and he said, "If you're ever granted a second act in life, don't repeat the first one."
so as gratified as I am by all the talk, I think...
I think that's all it is: talk.
so, then, what's next for Peter Florrick?
I've got to go into that courtroom in the next few weeks and win this appeal.
that's not gonna be easy.
I have a family - a wife who's been nothing short of amazing, two kids
strength through all of this.
I'm very proud of them.
I promised to address the elephant in the room, and so I have to do that now.
what drove you to seek prostitutes when you know it could put your life and your career in so much danger?
I'm a flawed human being.
and, uh... and I've paid a heavy price.
I'm not complaining. That's just the truth.
but I've looked in the mirror, and what I've seen, I don't like.
and I'm gonna change it.
that said, I do think it's time to turn the page, look to the future.
Thanks, love.
Oh, God, you smell good.
how'd it go?
good, I think. It was kinda weird.
Oh, by the way, this is Kya Poole, LLC Consultants.
she's a reputation manager.
Hello, Mrs. Florrick. I have a lot of respect for you.
thank you. - Thanks.
hope it fits. Prison fare takes its toll.
so I'll just change. Jim, can I use the bathroom?
that's the look the public misses: confident, real, optimistic.
know what he was talking about at that moment?
you.
I have to go.
stern, Lockhart & Gardner, right?
Yes. - Say hello to Will.
Hey, you'll drop by later, right?
Yeah, I'll stop by after work.
good.
I'm sor-sorry. What was the question again?
you work at Chicago Polytech, isn't that correct, Professor Whitton?
Yes. I, um, uh... I received a grant to research cellular reproduction...
I'm sorry, cellular reproduction in pluripotent stem cells.
more commonly known as cloning?
Yes, I - I'm sorry. Yes, cloning.
why does she keep apologizing so much?
that's who she is.
TAMARA: Now, the prosecution contends that you buckled under the pressure of your research.
you were supposed to deliver your results, and you missed several deadlines.
missing deadlines is just, um, I mean, everybody misses deadlines.
TAMARA: Did you set the fire that destroyed your lab, Professor Whitton?
no... Never.
I, uh... Look, I was on the verge of a career-defining fellowship at Cambridge.
I would never do anything to hurt my research.
where were you at the time of the fire?
um, I was running on the, uh, track across campus.
this is like watching a baby seal being clubbed.
that's after how many sessions of witness prep?
three.
you can't put her on the stand.
the stammering, the nerves; she looks guilty.
she's innocent.
Yeah, well, so's my four-year-old niece, but I wouldn't put her on the stand either.
what do you get from her? - Denial, alibi, context.
you still have the alibi witness?
and the guard and the arson expert.
I'd keep her a mile away from the stand.
you put her on, she's going away for 15 years.
that puts more pressure on the other witnesses.
get some tougher witness prep, will ya?
those were Wiffle Balls you were throwing at her.
the layoffs?
uh, I'll put Josephson on it.
Josephson? No.
I need it to be tougher. More blood sport.
you get two lawyers who really butt heads, make them prosecution-defense.
you need this to be more Darwinian, more real world.
doesn't get more Darwinian than that.
witness prep 108. Keith Thomas, arson expert.
Mr. Thomas, can you give us your professional opinion of the arson investigations?
it was a rush to judgment.
the fire department labeled it an arson, but the reality is, it could've been an accident.
but arson investigators said they found traces of lighter fluid at the crime scene.
they're calling it lighter fluid, but what they really found was butane, which is not only commonplace in a lab, but could spontaneously ignite.
thank you, sir.
spontaneously ignite?
are you serious?
Yes, I am serious. I try to be.
okay, well, then let's continue in this serious vein.
aren't all the flammable liquids stored in steel cabinets on the other side of the lab?
Yes, I believe that's correct.
you believe that's correct, but you don't know.
wouldn't you object at this point?
no, she wouldn't.
just do your best, sir.
we're just trying to prep you for the tough questions.
I misspoke. I should have said, "Yes, that's correct."
what about the wax residue found at the crime scene?
investigators say it came from a birthday candle used as part of a time-delay incendiary device.
you ever seen that before?
a birthday candle can be used as a three-minute fuse allowing the arsonist to flee before a fire.
but I think it's far more likely to have come from some wax paper, which would not be out of place at a lab.
Yeah, I seen that all the time in labs, for sandwiches or comb harmonicas.
that's kinda rude.
Oh, I'm just getting started.
did you ever visit Dr. Whitton's lab, sir?
no. I'm an expert witness; I'm not an investigator.
did you evaluate photos of the crime scene?
Yes, I did.
but ultimately, your assessment of the fire is based on pure conjecture.
I'm offering my theory based on years - Which you're being paid for.
as are you! - Yeah, but only one of us is trying to sell their theories as truth.
okay.
let's just sum up, shall we?
your belief is that a rag soaked in butane - a chemical which Dr. Whitton never used in her work
somehow migrated across the lab and into her research area, and then spontaneously ignited on a piece of discarded wax paper.
he was the best. Really.
we had three other arson experts, all half as good.
well... you know how I'm always looking for a silver lining.
it was a nice cross by your boy.
Yes. Darwin is alive and well.
the bad news is, we can't sell this as an accident.
wax paper and spontaneous combustion?
jurors will laugh you out of court.
so if we can't sell it as an accident, sell it as arson, just not by Ellen.
you're doubting my story?
no, we just feel we have better options.
but... But if I don't testify, won't the jury think that I'm... suspicious?
it's all about finding the best strategy for acquittal, Ellen.
they've taken my passport.
Yes, well, that's... standard.
would you excuse me, please?
I-I'm... I just... you know...
it feels like I'm just being put in a smaller and smaller box.
when does your family arrive?
they're not coming. The last continuance, they lost money on the plane tickets, and I just told them not to come.
I don't know anyone here.
I'll be right back.
you can go, too, if you want.
it's all right. - It's not.
I'm facing 15 years in prison.
left-wing bioconservatives, religious bioconservatives, animal rights activists
Ellen's lab received hate mail from all of them.
okay, good. Cary, you continue with witness prep.
Alicia, you help him.
try to keep it competitive.
Tamara, keep me in the loop.
What'd I miss?
plan B: Religious Fanatics.
saw your husband's appeal starts today.
Yep. - Should be interesting.
I'm kind of nostalgic for when things weren't so interesting.
you need a drink.
probably.
Hey, Mike.
Judy, you look great. - Oh... thank you.
so, you've gained a few pounds.
I heard you, uh, made some new friends in Tamms.
Yeah, a nice burglar.
I gave him your address.
you believe that?
I hired Landry. Taught him everything he knows.
let's just hope you didn't teach him too well.
all rise for the Honorable Judge Harvey Winter.
Mr. Florrick, it's been a long time.
always a pleasure, Your Honor.
GOLDEN: Uh, Your Honor, we would first like to schedule an evidentiary hearing to present new exculpatory evidence.
two weeks from today: 3: 00.
thank you, Your Honor.
I would also like you to consider releasing my client on electronic monitoring while the appeal is ongoing.
your Honor, bail should not even be on the table at this point...
bail hearing is set for day after tomorrow. 5:00.
your Honor, the state vehemently objects.
your vehemence is noted.
there will be a bail hearing here, day after tomorrow, at 5: 00, Mr. Landry.
you're welcome to join us.
if there's nothing else to schedule, next case.
how about that?
I could be out in two days.
Mr. Florrick... See you.
soon.
so, is he getting out?
how did you...?
who said that?
it was online. There's 65 articles.
one even in Singapore.
you make it a habit to check for Dad online?
no, I have it on Google Alert.
anytime there's an article, I get an e-mail.
so is he going to live here?
I don't know.
how would you feel about that, Grace?
there's no space. Where's he gonna stay?
in Mom's room. Where do you think?
he's gonna stay in your room?
I don't know. Look, this just happened.
it didn't even just happen. It might happen.
shouldn't he get an apartment? - Dad's not going to stay at an apartment.
and besides, you should be happy about this.
it means Grandma won't have to watch us. - Is that true?
Yeah, he'll be on electronic monitoring; he'll be stuck here.
he would? - I don't know.
this is very premature.
I promise you, we will sit down and we'll discuss this.
but for the moment, I have to go to school and you have to go to school.
okay?
I love you.
and I love you.
no, first you reject all press conferences.
you just want to be home with your family.
that's all. No statements, no photos.
keep the press starved, then they'll eat whatever you offer.
private holding room.
sure beats lockup.
Oh, yes, it's the upside of a special priority defendant.
the downside - everything else.
how are you? - It's great to see you, Peter.
uh, look... Landry is going to throw everything he can at you trying to shut down bail.
now, I know Judge Winter.
he's a decent guy. He wants to do the right thing.
a little nudge might help.
it's great to see you, Alex.
Peter, we go back 20 years, and you're looking for a wire.
the one casualty of the last eight months - trust.
so what are you saying?
I think we're fine.
appreciate your support.
good luck, Peter. - Thanks.
you know, I've never lived on a farm, but I think that's what it looks like when the weather vane changes direction.
a good change?
if the assistant state's attorney is coming to me, It's great change just that I'm in a time crunch.
does yours involve anthrax?
Hey, FBI big shot, you owe me a favor.
look, just give me 30 seconds.
there's only half a dozen pieces of hate mail.
cops didn't consider them any serious threat.
but I need a suspect.
so if any of them seem remotely legit, just... tell them two minutes.
Yeah, a couple women from Wyoming. Crazy, but harmless.
defenders of Natural Life. It's a boilerplate protest letter.
they're not known for taking any direct action.
this one, the Christian Coalition for Bioethics, they're legit.
they're radical religious bio-cons opposed to genetic engineering, cloning, stem cell research.
I've only known them to be active on the West Coast, but... - Define "active."
protests, vandalism... Not arson.
but, hey, people change.
they've also been known to put coded messages in their letters.
someone behind this has a real Zodiac complex.
good luck with that.
thank you for coming in early, Ms. Bennett.
we're really here just to make you comfortable with your testimony, not to rehearse you or get you to remember answers. In fact...
if you're remembering answers, we're doing our job poorly.
it'll just feel scripted in court.
no, I get it. You want me natural.
that's right.
so, the first thing we'll do is... - ...ask you some very basic questions.
what is your connection to this case?
well, I work the front desk at the biochem lab-- the one that burned down.
I work with Professor Whitton.
I'm in the Physics Department. She's in Chemistry.
uh, but we really bonded at a conference in St. Louis.
Walt, answer the questions simply. Nothing extraneous.
the prosecution is going to try to get you to ramble. Don't.
I see Ellen every day.
and, that day, she left at 7: 00 pm.
7: 00 pm. exactly?
Yes. Why?
I just find it odd.
when was the last time anything ever happened exactly at the hour?
um... Cary?
excuse me.
what are you doing?
I'm asking questions. - You're cross-examining.
so, that's my job.
no, our job is to prep her, not undercut her.
so, next time, warn her when you're flipping from advisor to prosecutor.
do we have a problem?
we have a problem if you're trying to show me up at the expense of witness prep.
okay. You're right. I'm sorry.
Ellen is a lovely person, and a great colleague.
uh, last fall, when I wrote a cover article about electron crystallography for the Journal of Quantum - Physics, which is... - Walt...
what? Yeah. - Don't answer more than the prosecution asks.
short, straightforward answers. Gives a sense of confidence.
okay. I got it.
tell me about the night of the fire.
I saw her walk out of the lab at 7: 00 p. m.
and she didn't return?
"yes" or "no" answers, Mary.
Ooh, right. Yes.
I was at Dobson Auditorium at 9: 00 for a concert, uh, when I stepped outside to phone my mother, and that's when I saw her, uh, running around the track.
from 50 yards away, you saw her?
I did, yeah. I - I recognized her track suit.
it's not 50 yards.
you know for a fact it's not 50 yards?
What'd you do? Did you measure it?
no, my students did.
it was an experiment in weights and measures.
it's exactly 34 yards.
a distance at which normal visual acuity can identify and distinguish between human features.
just reviewed the witness prep.
good job.
looks like both witnesses will be great.
Thanks. - No, thank you.
it's always the case, isn't it?
it's easier to rip apart than to build up, so... thanks for building up.
how's the appeal going?
Oh, Peter's appeal.
good. Really good. Just...
Peter will be out soon?
Yeah. I don't know.
well, if you ever need anything...
if I ever need... - Anything.
give me a call.
okay, I will.
Alicia Diane told me to come to you when anything...
so I just wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
it was on my windshield when I got to my car.
okay, you can drop the cool thing.
we're not at school anymore.
what cool thing?
look at you.
the way you're standing.
I'm just standing. What's your problem?
maybe it's from Mom's work.
wait.
maybe we should... - What?
I don't know.
great.
is that Dad?
I don't know.
is it... Is this fake, too?
I don't know.
this is getting crazy.
Zach, this is serious.
I know.
but we agreed - they're just trying to scare Mom.
maybe there's a reason she should be scared.
we don't know enough. - What do we need to know?
who sent this.
okay, so how?
anything on the CCB letters?
depends.
does "hidvycilfeteenuc" mean anything to you?
what's the context?
how's witness prep?
not bad. We'll talk.
I know we've talked about you having to testify, but it might happen sooner than we anticipated.
how soon? - Tomorrow.
you want me to testify at his bail hearing?
we need to show the judge that Peter will have a safe, stable living situation if he's out on bail, and that he will be welcomed home.
you know what I'd like back?
privacy.
landry's cross could get personal.
they think that Peter has the judge in his pocket, so they're out to draw blood.
so keep your answers short, to the point, unemotional.
I spent six hours prepping witnesses today.
it's one thing to know it. Um...
lawyers always make the worst witnesses.
Thanks.
I just want you to be prepared.
who hired Kya? You or Peter?
I did.
why did you hesitate?
I didn't - uh, Peter has lots of friends who want to see his reputation burnished.
in a way, they hired her. But she's good.
I mean, she supposedly did the same thing for the Madoff sons this year.
and that went so well.
do you want me to prep you?
no. Thank you. I think I can handle it.
if you don't mind me saying, there is some... ambivalence inherent in your position, Alicia.
and ambivalence could hurt Peter's chances.
I'm not going to lie on the stand, Daniel.
that's not what I'm saying. The truth is the truth, but it can often sound... truer.
is the judge in Peter's pocket?
no.
I'll see you in court.
Mr. Ford, your witness.
you testified earlier that Dr. Whitton left the lab at 7: 00 pm?
I mean, yes.
how long was your shift that night?
3: 00 to 10: 00. - Seven hours.
you must have taken restroom breaks occasionally.
you could have missed Dr. Whitton reentering the building.
I don't think I took any breaks after 7: 00.
you don't think?
objection. Badgering the witness.
overruled.
uh, you're under oath, Mary.
can you state with certainty that you never left your post after 7: 00 pm?
n-no. I just... - You just...?
I'm just not sure.
so Professor Whitton may have reentered the building while you were away from the security desk.
in fact, she may never have left.
no.
um, I really think...- A lot of middle-aged brunettes work at the lab.
you could have mistaken someone else for her.
I'm pretty sure... - Pretty sure?
are you or are you not absolutely certain you saw Dr. Whitton that night?
Yes.
we went through all those questions in prep.
more than once. - Some witnesses get intimidated by court.
there's not much you can do to prepare for that.
make sure Walt holds up.
so, how damaging was that?
it wasn't good.
but we've still got the threatening letters and Walt.
do you and Walt have any history between you?
between... No... no, no.
he just said that you two really bonded at a conference in St. Louis.
well, we both attended it.
we sat next to each other at an awards banquet.
Oh, the night he won an award?
the cover article he wrote for The Journal of Quantum Physics...
turns out to be three paragraphs on page 46.
we can't put someone who embellishes like that on the stand.
what we can't do is elicit perjured testimony.
so make sure he doesn't perjure himself.
but he's... - You're never handed the perfect witness.
you make the perfect witness.
we're not sure we should put you on the stand, Walt.
what?
I thought she needed me.
she does. But we don't think you're being straight with us.
Yes, I am.
no storytelling. No embellishments."Yes" means yes."No" means no.
and if you get stuck - if the prosecution asks you something you don't know or you don't understand
don't ad lib an answer.
you just say you don't know, or you wouldn't want to speculate.
good.
where were you the night of the arson, Walt?
I was at the auditorium for the piano recital.
it started at 8: 30 in auditorium number four.
that one has the best acoustics, because of the... - No. Walt.
eight-word sentences, max. You get to word nine, just stop talking.
how long were you at the concert?
left around 9: 00 to make a phone call.
to whom?
my mother.
and that's when I saw Ellen across the street, at the track, running.
you saw her at the track at 9: 00, but she may have just arrived.
how do you know she didn't light the fuse and run straight to the track?
I'm going to need more than nine words to answer that.
okay, if she lit the fuse and the firefighters respond within five minutes, that gives her a total of eight minutes to run two miles.
if she can do that, she might as well sign up for the Olympics.
my cousin Doug was in the Olympics, actually.
it was a joke.
so, a letter written by the Christian Coalition for Bioethics should have all the hallmarks of a Protestant terrorist group: the logo, the cryptic apropos Bible quote.
right?
so why did they pull a quote from the Douay-Rheims edition, a Catholic Bible?
St. Mary's, K through 12.
see, Protestant versions, like King James, call it the book of Isaiah, no "s" at the end.
and verse 9: 18 is some variation of "For wickedness burneth like the fire"
did the first CCB letter use the Catholic Bible, too?
both do.
I think it's a red herring; I think someone created it to throw the blame on somebody else.
I think you might have someone in mind.
well, if I were a cynic, I'd say our client. Letter on her windshield.
you are a cynic.
Yep.
what is that?
nothing. - Oh, my God.
how'd you...?
you know what? You're liking this.
this is serious stuff, and you're just having fun.
do I look like I'm having fun?
Yeah, you do.
look, somebody's trying to set up Dad.
then go show it to him.
what?
go show this stuff to Dad.
he's at his bail hearing. Go show him.
Peter Florrick was tried, convicted, sentenced.
there's no longer any presumption of innocence.
this is not about innocence. This is about bond.
Peter Florrick has no previous record, he is not a flight risk.
he is a family man who is eager to go home to his wife and children, who are eager to have him.
Oh, come on! They are not eager.
is this true, Mr. Golden?
it is, Your Honor. They are... eager.
well... Let's find out.
please state your name for the record.
please state your relationship to the defendant.
I'm his wife.
thank you, Mrs. Florrick.
and what is your current living situation?
I live with my - with our - two children in a three-bedroom apartment at 3001 N. Dearborn Street.
and is there room for Mr. Florrick there?
Yes.
and should he be granted a pretrial release, are you prepared to have him at home?
um... do you want him there?
I think Peter should be home with his children.
thank you.
LANDRY: Mrs. Florrick, you mentioned the apartment is a three bedroom, and you have two children.
would they share a room?
no.
so, you and your husband would... share a room?
Yes.
you're saying under oath that you intend to share a bed with...
objection, Your Honor. - Relevance.
I'm-I'm simply establishing that there truly is a place for Mr. Florrick, - given everything that's... - This is a private family matter, Your Honor.
that's enough, Counselor.
whether they intend to share a bed is of no concern to this court.
thank you, Your Honor.
Mrs. Florrick, I have one more question.
did you meet with a divorce attorney on February 23?
Yes.
I had a brief consultation with a divorce attorney a few days after the allegations against my husband surfaced, in order to weigh my options.
are you saying you've ruled out the possibility of divorce?
I-I have no plans to divorce.
but you haven't ruled it out?
I haven't ruled out running for president.
probably won't happen, but I haven't ruled it out.
so, you intend to welcome Mr. Florrick back into your home?
Yes. - Despite the sexual dalliances with call girls...
my son is here, Mr. Landry.
are you suggesting you'd give different answers if he weren't?
I'm suggesting you stop asking invasive and irrelevant questions.
isn't it true... - What's your goal here, Mr. Landry?
Mrs. Florrick... - To do your boss's bidding?
to embarrass me? Embarrass my husband?
to goad me into some emotional public renunciation of him?
the relevant question here is whether Peter has a suitable place to go home to.
and I am stating under oath, that he does.
any further questions?
why don't we leave it there?
I'll take the arguments and testimony into consideration and rule tomorrow.
I can't believe you.
it's really not that big of a deal.
how did you even get out here?
I took the El.
I wanted to see Dad.
why wasn't he there?
because this was just for the lawyers.
and don't try and change the subject.
you ask me.
you talk to me.
I would have brought you.
you wouldn't have. - I...
I would have.
so trust me.
I thought you kicked ass.
you're still in trouble.
I know.
I have to get you home, and then I have to check an alibi.
what is that?
this? Nothing. Homework.
I ran an ink X-ray analysis on the fake CCB letters.
the toner is Office Store brand 4546-H.
very unique. And one of the few places that uses it is the printer at Ellen's office.
okay, well, that's disappointing.
Yep, disappointing because it looks like she's sending threats to herself.
where are you?
Polytech. The auditorium.
Cary and I are going to check out her alibi.
what? - I'm losing you. Call me back.
so, Walt came out of auditorium four and he stood here.
right. He came out at 9: 00 pm looked across the street.
34 yards towards the track where Ellen was running.
well, with this lighting, that should be all right.
do you have a navigation system?
Yeah.
Ah, finally. Bars. I wasn't getting any before.
Yeah. Me, neither.
recital hall must be a dead zone.
auditorium at school has a scrambler to stop cell phones from ringing during a performance.
I bet they got the same thing here.
how could Walt phone his mom from the auditorium door, if it's a dead zone?
and look - check this out.
Walt said the fire trucks came here, on University Av, but the fire station is there and the lab is there.
Yeah.
but Garden Av is a direct route.
why would the firefighters go the long way around?
they wouldn't.
yeah?
what toner does Walt's office use?
the Physics Department?!
the same. The whole Science Department orders in bulk.
Oh, my God.
what? - Walt said it.
only an Olympian could run two miles in eight minutes.
so how does he get eight minutes?
three minutes for the fuse to burn down, and five minutes for the firefighters to arrive.
but how does Walt know the fuse is three minutes?
the arson expert mentioned it in prep, but how does Walt know?
cause he did it.
if we go to the state's attorney's office...
there's not enough to clear Ellen and prosecute Walt.
we don't have definitive proof he sent the CCB letters.
they'd simply thank us and bury it.
you know one option, if you want to really be gutsy?
nail him on the stand.
trap him in his own lies.
and if we do it wrong, we just proved our alibi false.
Hey, no pain, no gain.
did you really just say that?
Yes, I did.
meant it, too.
well... we're either about to destroy the prosecution's case or make it.
uh, I arrived just as the performance began at 8: 30.
around 9: 00, I stepped outside to phone my mother... uh, right in front of the recital hall.
did she answer?
uh, no, I... I got her voicemail.
but the recital hall scrambles the signals so calls don't interfere with the performance, so how could you have gotten through?
I wouldn't want to speculate.
there's no record of that call in your cell phone records.
no record of any call at all... - What is this? What is she doing?
just wait. - Did you see anyone while you were in front of the recital hall?
uh, yes.
uh, I saw Ellen Whitton, uh, running the track across the street.
and then the fire trucks raced by to the lab.
on University Avenue? - Uh, yes, that's correct.
but University Avenue isn't the most direct route from the fire station to the lab.
uh, well... I'm sure that emergency vehicles can go any way they want, can't they?
I'm not sure why they'd opt to go the longer way when they could just take Garden Avenue.
well, I guess you'd have to ask them.
I did.
they said they did take Garden Avenue.
where were you when the fire occurred, Walt?
uh, I was at the, uh, the piano recital, like I said.
strange. We can't find a single person who remembers seeing you at the recital hall.
even during intermission.
I, uh, I went right to the restroom at intermission. I,uh, wasn't feeling well.
there was no intermission that night.
the performance was Brahms' Piano Concerto Number One in D minor.
you weren't at the recital, Walt.
you were at the lating... to set the fire, destroy Ellen's research, and frame her for it.
no. No.
What...? Why...?
if I wanted to-to-to frame her, why would I be here, vouching for her?
I don't know. Is it because you set the fire to keep her here instead of off at the Cambridge fellowship?
but you never meant to have it pinned on her, did you?
and when it was, you tried to save her.
with an alibi. With fake letters from a hate group.
I...
Mr. Gifford?
Mr. Gifford, let me quickly say, you have a Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
Aw, crap.
all rise for the Honorable Judge Harvey Winter.
before I rule on bail, I'm told the prosecution intends to make a proffer to the court.
that's correct, Your Honor.
the state has recently received evidence that the defendant has attempted to interfere with the judicial process.
What?! - I have a signed affidavit from ASA Alex Phelan stating that
Peter Florrick has asked him to influence Your Honor into granting bail.
now we know Your Honor is truly impartial, and that any influence would have landed on deaf ears, but we also believe that Mr. Florrick has put you in an awkward position, confusing the public as to the impartiality of any bail offer you might extend.
your Honor, this is outrageous!
it is that, Mr. Golden.
it is pure fiction.
Mr. Phelan is an officer of the court, Counselor.
unless you have concrete evidence that Mr. Phelan is lying, the proffered information is considered reliable and relevant.
bail is hereby denied.
this court is adjourned.
Peter, I'm so sorry.
Alex Phelan was at Zach's baptism, remember?
could he have misinterpreted?
no.
it's a betrayal.
I thought I'd be leaving with you.
Mr. Florrick. - You'll tell the kids?
I will.
I'll see you.
this was a set-up.
Peter didn't make bail.
so, who is it?
I don't know.
but... What's he doing?
he's taking pictures of our front door.
Why?
I don't know.
Dr. crispill to the emergence.
Dr. crispill to the emergence.
this is a delaying tactic, your honor. it's...
she was just contacted this morning.
that's not a delaying tactic;
that's a simple procedural... -- sit down.
