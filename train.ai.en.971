you're sure the kids will be there? - Yeah, they'll be here.
they think this is gonna be the easiest score they've ever pulled.
Oswald better show. - He will.
the kids get me the Krugerrands, i drop them in the locker, and Oswald delivers them to his fence.
just like that? - Just like that.
Russell is headed your way.
our courier has arrived.
that's, i didn't do anything.
I need you to come with me.
krugerrands. Where'd you get these?
they fell off a truck.
I want to talk to my lawyer.
of course. What honest man doesn't?
you ready for this?
born ready.
dude, watch where you're going!
I'm sorry about that. Here, let me help. Hold on.
Hey, get your hands off my stuff. - What's going on?
do you know how much i paid for those groceries? - Here comes manny.
this guy runs into me, and now he's trying to pocket my stuff.
look, i'm not trying to steal anything. Okay?
I'm just trying to help you out here.
just hit and run me, then. - Calm down. He's trying to help you.
just listen to the lady. Handle it yourself, okay?
how about that? - Walk along!
Yeah, Jones deserves an oscar.
Manny's approaching the drop.
smooth.
I'm glad he's on our side.
Caffrey is headed toward the lockers.
how's it going? - So far, so good.
you're a convincing mark.
well, wait till they find out what i do for a living.
should we take the kids in?
not yet. I don't want to spook Oswald. We wait.
you guys should invest in some of those little, um, christmas-tree air fresheners.
you don't like the van. Noted.
Peter, can i talk to you?
we took russell back to the bureau.
he didn't call his lawyer.
who'd he call? - Play it.
what? I didn't do anything.
explain this. Play it.
I'm not working with the fbi!
they got me with the case. What was i supposed to do?
tell them i can still get 'em alex hunter, but they got to post bail!
why is Russell talking about Alex Hunter?
do you know who he's talking to?
went to a burner phone. - Answer my question.
Alex is in trouble.
Alex is back? Damn it, neal.
I can't let my guard down for one day, can i?
you used us to take Russell out of play.
if you jeopardized this case... - i didn't, Peter.
Diana? - It's 8: 00. i don't think Oswald's gonna show.
Yeah, i guess he conned all of us.
check the locker.
Why? - Check it.
the case isn't here. Damn it!
did we ever lose visual on the locker? - No.
then how'd he get the bag? !
he was here the entire time.
so help me, if this was part of your plan
it wasn't. Oswald improved my con.
then you better figure out how to catch him.
Oh, why is he here? I asked for Alex.
understandably, my client does not trust the FBI.
she has asked her lawyer to preside in her absence.
got a nice little practice going? - I do all right.
helps when you're friends with criminals.
thanks to you two, i got a pound of shrapnel in my ass from today's misfire.
tell me why you really put us onto Russell.
and it better be good.
someone's looking for alex.
Russell said he could deliver her, and we took him out of play before he could.
who's looking for her?
probably the same people who killed Kate.
if Oswald has the coins, he'll try and fence them eventually.
that's what i'm counting on. And you're gonna help make that happen.
we're gonna make Oswald reveal the Krugerrands and the painting.
well... how?
those coins belonged to someone who probably wants them back, right?
tell me who.
uh... Russell may or
or may not be an old connection from Detroit...
the Detroit mob? - Yeah.
all right, i'm gonna have to convince oswald i'm in with them.
what if he recognizes you? - He won't.
unlike you, the bureau makes sure that my picture doesn't get in the paper.
he knows you. You -- i don't trust. So...
impossible. He studies crime for a living.
you'd need an expert on the Detroit mob to pull that o
I just found my expert.
Hello?
can i help you?
you took something of mine.
is that so?
tell him you're the peacemaker.
that's an old Detroit player. Do it.
I'm the peacemaker.
well, i don't recall starting any wars.
I'm sure, uh...This is a misunderstanding.
you stole my Krugerrands, and i want them back.
listen, i don't have time for jokes.
okay.
when it's a matter of our missing money, - i never joke. - I never joke.
this picture tells a story, Professor.
I don't see myself in that story.
no, but you see the case.
and now you've got it.
tell him you'll cut off his hands if he doesn't pay up.
what? - It's the detroit mob, not the girl scouts.
I wouldn't want anything to happen to your hands, Professor.
I said cut off his hands! - Quiet, moz.
all right, listen, listen, if you're the peacemaker, i'm sure we can find some common ground.
the krugerrands were worth $2 million.
I want $3 million for my trouble.
well, well, that's simply not possible.
make it possible. Deliver it tomorrow.
or i'll start with your thumbs.
or i'll start with your thumbs.
I can get you $200, 000.
$200, 000? - 10%.
no, no, no, no. 30% is the going rate.
$600, 000. fine.
okay. I need that wired today. Okay?
no prob.
how much can i get for this?
original thayer. Nice.
I'll give you half a mil.
where does it say "dumb schmuck" on my face?
the painting's been sliced. Take it or leave it.
listen, it's cut at the frame line.
Re-stretched, you're not gonna lose even an inch of canvas.
you won't have any trouble finding an enthusiastic buyer in macao or singapore, and i think you know that.
Ah, Professor's done his homework. - Yes.
okay. $2 million.
wired today.
got it.
I'll need your account and routing number.
testing me, were you?
there you go.
it's a pleasure doing business, george.
I wish i could say that
FBI! Don't move!
hands on the table! Hands on the table!
george Oswald, you're under arrest.
no. No.
good to see you again, Professor.
careful with his hands.
I want to see my lawyer.
come on, get moving.
thank you, Miss Hunter.
and i believe you've been looking for this.
uh, per Neal's suggestion, we've booked you on a secure flight to Italy.
and we made sure we publicly thanked Russell for his thoughtful and continued cooperation with the FBI.
Neal said you were the best.
Hello, everyone.
your Professor, George Oswald, will not be joining you today.
instead, i'm here as a recruiter -- for the FBI.
Hi, i'm special agent Peter Burke.
and these are some of my colleagues.
they studied criminology just like you, and now they get to catch bad guys for a living.
FBI. You're under arrest.
guys, s-stay calm.
professor Oswald! He made us do it!
good job, Manny! Way to stay calm! - Veronica, let me handle this.
no, listen to me. No, no, no, no, no.
listen, you don't understand. You don't understand.
if you think it's fun reading about these guys, wait until you experience the feeling of catching them.
for the record, i still maintain that i basically turned myself in.
the full weight of the FBI was bearing down on you.
I wear a badge.
he wears a tracking anklet.
applications are on the table.
you think we don't know how this works? We know how this works!
Manny! Shut your mouth! Manny! - I got this!
there's a lot of information that we have for you.
Manny, shut the hell up! - D. A.'s dream.
tripping over themselves to cut a deal.
they're young. We'll probably give it to 'em.
look at us.
saving america's youth from a life of crime.
Ah, we're a regular after-school special.
one second.
Diana... - Boss, you have some time?
I have something to show you.
but take a look.
narrow tunnel with a slight ridge.
there's something there.
leaving so soon?
Venice is calling.
Oh, you know what? I'm gonna actually keep that up here with me.
okay, sure.
you know, it's interesting.
they searched oswald's house and found several of the things he was suspected of stealing
jewelry, egyptian artifacts.
but there was a Matisse...
Matisse?
it was rumored oswald had it, but it wasn't at his house.
that's shame. It'd be worth a fortune.
Yes, it would. It's about the size of your box there.
I'll keep an eye out.
I could use the reward money.
I'm sure you could.
goodbye, neal.
be careful.
you too.
if someone's looking for me...
they're coming after me, too.
that's the last piece of the music box.
I'm giving up my obsession.
you're suggesting i give up mine?
Kate's gone.
the rest of us are still here.
goodbye, alex.
whatever this thing's hiding, it's not the music.
I think it's a keyhole.
a key to what?
could we get it into x-ray?
not without alerting somebody.
I don't want to take a hammer to it just yet.
it could self-destruct.
wouldn't surprise me.
let's see if we can find that missing piece.
maybe our friend knows where it is.
in memory
are we going to Montebello? - Yep.
the times food critic called it the best new restaurant in Manhattan.
yelp gave it three stars.
Wow. They practice molecular gastronomy.
what? - It's a revolution in fine dining where chefs use biochemistry to create new and exotic dishes.
a grill works just fine for me.
every dish is a work of art.
I'm surprised you chose Montebello.
it's expensive. - I'm impressed.
Oh, we're not eating there.
okay, Peter, this is like me taking you to Yankee stadium and then listening to the game in the parking lot.
it's a meeting place. I didn't pick it.
who did? - The insurance investigator.
Oh, insurance? Great.
someone stole $100 million in Japanese bearer bonds.
samurai bonds. Nice.
that's what they're call on the street.
Oh, now I've got your interest.
so who's the investigator?
she has a suspect here in Manhattan.
she? Wait, wait. Is it?
no. It is?
Yeah. Yeah.
agent Burke, it's nice to see you.
Neal Caffrey. It's been a while.
Sara. Nearly five years since you testified at my trial. Against me.
well, you did steal a painting insured by my employer for several million dollars.
not according to a jury of my peers.
I thought all your peers were in prison.
a few of us managed to stay out. - I could fix that.
sorry to break up this happy reunion, but we're here to talk about the samurai bonds.
that's what they call them out on the street.
well, we're not here to talk about them, we're here to find them.
a girl's got to make a living.
well, my fees are based on recovery, so, yeah.
Sara? - My company, Sterling Bosch, insured a hundred million in non-government Japanese bearer bonds.
a hundred million yen or U. S. dollars? - Dollars.
and if you recover them? - 2%.
the truck was hijacked in transport, and I think the bonds are somewhere here in New York.
she believes Edgar Halbridge is involved.
Biinternational real-estate guy.
he can move them without raising flags.
Yes, he can. Excuse me.
Hi! Emilio's just inside.
thank you so much. - You're welcome.
Hey, you! That's my car! Get away from it!
Emilio, listen to me.
you can change the Vin numbers, you can change the grill, the paint.
it's still a Mercedes SLR.
I know, because you did not change the electronic Vin behind the steering wheel.
you're crazy! You're just stealing my car!
no. You stole it. I'm taking it back.
don't make a scene.
you can file a complaint with my friend from the FBI.
Hey. Hi, there.
special Agent Burke, FBI.
this is just a misunderstanding. I should just...
you should stop walking and put your hand above your head.
Yeah, running just annoys him.
so you're basically a high-class repo man.
well, I prefer white-collar bounty hunter.
you should put that on your business card.
this is a limited edition SLR, worth $450, 000.
making your cut $9, 000.
not a bad score on your lunch break.
no, it's not. Speaking of business cards...
when you feel like turning in that Raphael, please call me.
I wouldn't wait by the phone.
see you tomorrow Caffrey.
so happy to have you back in my life.
it's clear.
come on.
Hey, you okay? - Yeah.
Yeah, Kate was sitting on the left side by the window.
definitely no accident.
did you ever think it was? - No.
a mechanical failure wouldn't cause an explosion by the door.
I bet it was set to explode the plane in mid-air.
it went off early.
or someone set it off early.
what about the black box?
the whole tail's missing.
excuse me! Who are you?
you said the guard's route takes 15 minutes. - That's not the guard.
all right. Just follow me on this one.
what are you doing in here? - Morning. We're with Sterling Bosch.
you're Roy? - Where you been, Roy?
unlike you, we're on a schedule here.
sterling Bosch? Insurance?
Yeah.
no one told me you were coming.
I thought Wentlow Sterlings was handling the claim.
they were. Where's the cockpit voice recorder?
Oh, that's been logged in with NTSB in Washington.
I hope you made a backup.
insurance? - Just trust me on this one.
listen, how'd you guys get in here?
we walked in. - Your security is abysmal.
we have one guard for four hangars.
good to know.
listen, we made a copy of the voice recording.
I only handle the physical evidence.
I don't have access to the recording.
when's our flight leave? - Two hours.
I can have F. A.A. Send a copy to you.
that would work. - Yeah, I guess that would work.
I'll have them send it to, uh, Sterling Bosch. What's your name?
you know what, why don't you have them send it to my insurance investigator, Sara Ellis.
I can do that. - Great. I'll follow up with a call tomorrow morning.
all right. Ask for my assistant. I'll give her a heads up.
Thanks, Roy. - Yeah, bye, Roy.
Hey, we'll get it. - Yeah.
who's Sara Ellis?
Oh, you weren't at my trial. She was.
Yeah.
she testified against me.
I testified against you.
Oh, that's different. How can I work with her?
I'm the cunning art thief who slipped through her fingers.
I don't think she used those words.
no, but she looks at me and sees dollar signs.
she's gonna come after me again for that Raphael.
do you have it?
okay. There's a hundred million stolen bonds out there.
she knows this case better than anybody.
right now, we're on the same team, so play nice.
she... I... - No. Don't.
but... Fine. - Good.
start a conversation.
Sara, I feel like we got off on the wrong foot. Let's start over.
you want to be friends? - Why not?
okay, what? Coffee? Grab a bite?
sure. - How about dinner?
or maybe a movie? You like classics, right?
good memory.
are you worried about her and Neal? - Not at all.
you name the date, Neal.
I would love to spend time with you.
anything to keep you talking.
you're recording me?
everything you say to me can and will be used to nail your ass to the wall and recover my painting.
everything okay, Neal?
what's that?
I could get used to this.
okay, people.
you know Sara Ellis, from Sterling Bosch.
thanks to her Intel, we have subpoenaed coded e-mails between an alias we think is Edgar Halbridge and a man in hamburg he calls Mr. Black.
the e-mails use a public-key encryption.
we've cracked most of them.
we believe Mr. Black is a courier.
Halbridge has paid him a one-time fee to enter the U. S.
and get the bonds out of the country.
the bonds are transferable?
no title. Whoever holds them owns them.
each certificate is worth 200 grand.
so a stack of $100 million is this thick?
Halbridge is taking a huge risk using a courier.
I'd take the risk.
our plan is to intercept Mr. Black when he transfers planes in Toronto.
then we put Neal into his place here in Manhattan.
thank you for the heads up.
you said you cracked most of the e-mails.
what's in the one's you haven't? - Don't know.
Halbridge won't recognize Mr. Black?
from the vernacular of the e-mails, we think he's an American ex-pat.
the last e-mail says Black will be the guy wearing a leather jacket and carrying a copy of "atlas shrugged,
which tells me he doesn't know what he looks like.
let's make this happen.
you're welcome.
for what? - Oh, I recover the bonds, and your cut is $2 million.
see, I thought the bureau needed me, - given their recovery rate is less than 1 in 20. - Is that true?
that's the bureau's recovery rate. Not mine.
canadian authorities have detained Mr. Black in Toronto but left his name on the flight manifest to JFK.
as far as Halbridge is concerned, Black lands in an hour.
we've duplicated his wardrobe and every item he had on him.
diesel jacket, leather wallet, and copy of...
atlas shrugged. Mr. Black's a lone wolf.
german chocolate.
not a fan of the bittersweet.
from the airport, you'll take a cab to fort Green.
you'll wait there for a car to pick you up.
the location's open. We'll be back eight blocks.
we can't get closer without risking our cover.
GPS tracker and voice transmitter in the watch.
we'll be behind you.
as soon as you see those bonds, we move in on him.
what's the activation phrase?
you'll say,"long flight," and we'll be there.
long flight.
should I be getting a recovery fee, because Sara gets 2% and I feel like I'm doing the heavy lifting.
move.
I'm standing alone by a waste treatment plant.
sexy. We got him?
GPS signal is locked.
car coming.
here we go.
black limo. Arriving from the South.
got Mr. Black.
I'll confirm when the job is complete.
everything is as you requested,Your gloves, your briefcase.
what happened?
we lost the signal.
is everything in order?
that is the correct gun?
Yeah.
no GPS, no audio.
what do you mean? Did he do that or did we?
neither. Looks like someone's jamming it.
sure was a long flight.
what was that, sir?
Oh, I... I said,It sure was a long flight.
Ruger Mark Ⅱ with tactical solutions receiver.
red dot holographic sight. Good.
as you requested.
we still don't have a visual.
get eyes on him. Neal said he arrived from the South. Let's use that.
call NYPD. See if we can rush in one of their helicopters.
couldn't carry this with me on my long flight, could I?
everything else is in place.
that's fantastic.
okay, get a visual on the black limo.
Halbridge's office is in midtown and he lives on the upper West Side.
send a team to both.
NYPD can get a chopper in the air in five minutes.
otherwise we're flying blind.
great. They've got a head start, and we are looking for a black limo somewhere in Brooklyn.
everything all right, Mr. Black?
how much farther? - We're close.
target's on the first floor.
I'm here if there's any resistance.
stay here.
keep the engine running.
any time you guys want to break that safe distance you're maintaining,
I'd appreciate it.
he's back up.
have I mentioned how long my flight was?
lawrence of Arabia" long.
he's giving us the takedown signal. Where is he?
GPS is coming up.
I hope you guys are close 'cause I think I'm supposed to kill somebody.
did he say "kill somebody"?
I'm walking into a house with a loaded gun.
please stop me.
my driver has a gun, also. If I don't do this, he might, so I'm going to go through with this until you get here.
found him. 8602 2nd street, park slope.
get a team there now! Who lives there?
Oh, God. - Go! Go!
Freeze! - Wait! Don't shoot!
why did he say,"don't shoot"?
because she's gonna kill him.
this is because I won't let the Raphael go.
no, it's not. This isn't what it looks like.
it looks like you're here to kill me.
okay, it is what it looks like. I was sent here to kill you.
look, Mr. Black from hamburg isn't a courier.
he's an assassin. - Right.
there's a driver outside. He's armed.
he may come in here if he doesn't see muzzle flashes.
I can make that happen.
that's probably Peter.
look, I'm putting the gun down.
answer the phone.
this better be Peter.
it is. Tell me you haven't shot Caffrey yet.
no, not yet. - The flight was long, Peter!
who wants me dead?
Peter, is that true? - It looks that way, yes.
we can arrest the driver outside.
work him to get to Halbridge.
that doesn't guarantee we'll recover the bonds.
what do you suggest?
let him think I'm dead.
congratulations, Caffrey.
you've killed me.
it's done. Let's go.
what about the gun?
I left it in the briefcase for the driver to dispose of.
I know, but apparently that was part of my plan.
we intercepted the e. M.T.'S and NYPD.
we put out reports that she's confirmed dead.
where is Sara now?
jones was taking her to the safe house.
I took her to the safe house. She didn't want to stay.
why not? - Gentlemen. Neal.
you're really redefining business casual.
hardly recognized you without the ruger.
you should step out.
I think I'll step out.
my files on Halbridge. Please put them in there.
first things first. I need pants.
Jones, find her some pants.
what are you doing? You okay?
it's been a rough night. You should get some rest.
we'll talk on the way to the safe house.
I'm good. - You're staying?
Peter, I was woken out of a dead sleep by Neal Caffrey standing over me with a gun.
I would love to be somewhere I could trust.
any progress on the pants?
here's your bag.
thank you.
where are you gonna sleep? - I will be fine.
something about an attempt on your life really gets the blood flowing, like a double shot of red bull and espresso.
I think I just invented a drink.
you boys got any scotch?
get a cot. Bring it up here. - You got it.
it's been a while since somebody wanted me dead.
don't look so surprised.
the question is why does Halbridge want me dead?
which means what's so special about you?
I play a mean cello.
I work for Sterling Bosch. I can be replaced.
kill me, another investigator takes over, and Halbridge knows that.
so, honestly, why me?
Sara. We'll figure this out.
we are gonna get this guy.
how's the coffee around here? We have a lot of work to do.
you were supposed to be here an hour ago.
Yeah, well, we can't all spend our nights sipping wine on my couch.
not with that attitude, you can't.
I was a little busy posing as a professional killer.
as you said.
are you tipsy? - A little bit.
Where's the cockpit recording?
I checked with Roy's office.
the package from the F. A.A. Arrived at Sterling Bosch earlier today, care of Sara Ellis.
so what happened? Where is it now?
you went and killed her is what happened.
it's under lock and key while they investigate her "death."
okay. I'll find a way into Sterling Bosch.
look, your best chance is to wait until sleeping beauty awakens from her dirt nap and snag it then.
I'm guessing you're not her favorite person at this moment?
no. - Then I would suggest cozying up to her.
she put a gun in my face.
and cocked it? - Yeah.
you've come back from worse.
love what you've done with the place.
what do you want, Caffrey?
look, I feel bad about last night, so I bought you a housewarming gift.
I know how much you've been wanting this.
the Raphael you stole.
no. But it's a nice print of a stolen Raphael.
says so right here. - Homey.
Yeah, I mean, we're working closely on this case...
Really?
are we gonna keep doing this? - Really. Keep talking.
cause I can go on all day. - Please.
Hey, kids. Playing nice?
Neal brought me a gift. - Ah, the Raphael.
cute. - He wants something.
I can't get you a present?
when someone like you gets someone like me a gift, there's a reason.
Peter, what do you think Neal wants?
he's never given me a present.
I sent you birthday cards.
wasn't a present. Do you want something from Ms. Ellis?
I want her to stop pointing guns at me.
that can be arranged. Sit.
let's talk about Halbridge.
Sara, why do you think he wants you out of the way?
I don't know.
what do you have in your files that we don't have?
well, I dug deep.
um, stocks, security, all his land holdings.
tenant lease agreements.
we've already seen all that.
I believe so.
Mr. Black. When was the first e-mail sent to him?
good. Figure out when he arranged the hit?
Yeah. Yeah.
all right. Here it is.
five weeks ago, what were you digging into?
five weeks ago?
this.
Ridgemont is an apartment complex on West End Avenue.
it was the first place that Halbridge lived when he came to New York.
he bought it for nostalgia? - It's a classic six.
maybe Halbridge is into pre-war architecture.
maybe, but he's renovated all his other properties except for Ridgemont.
there's something there he doesn't want to let go of.
Yeah, and you should ask him.
doubt he'll discuss it with the FBI.
do you think he'd talk to Mr. Black?
if you have a weapon, I'll take it.
I don't.
I'm gonna check.
get your hands off me.
it's all right, Nico.
what is so important that you need to see me in person?
you want to do this in front of him?
I'm more comfortable that he stays.
did you enjoy your trip to New York?
it isn't over yet.
it should be.
your business, as I understand it, is complete.
not quite.
I'm here to talk about Ridgemont.
that supposed to mean something?
you hired me to kill a woman.
this conversation is over.
I asked myself,"why kill her?
she must mean something to you.
so before I took care of her, we had a little talk, and she had a lot to say about Ridgemont apartments.
if you're insinuating that I had some woman killed, what makes you think that I won't have you killed right where you sit?
that crossed my mind.
here's what happens now.
you're going to transfer $2 million into my account.
you got 48 hours, or the FBI gets a call telling them to look into any connection between you and Ridgemont apartments.
liquidating $2 million in assets will take some time.
you're a wealthy and resourceful man. You'll think of something.
if I don't?
you got a lot more to lose than I do.
we were right.
Ridgemont was the way in.
good. Jones, Diana, keep monitoring Halbridge's phones and assets.
there are plenty of places to plant a bug in his house.
if you want to go that way.
you're playing with guns. I'm not letting you back in there.
just letting that simmer.
what happens if he actually transfers the $2 mil to Mr. Black?
it'll be a good day for Mr. Black.
I've got a team watching Ridgemont.
if Halbridge makes a move, we'll figure out what's so important in there.
now, explain to me why your hair was slicked back.
amateur production of "grease"?
I do think you'd make a sublime Danny Zuko.
Oh, not Kenickie?
Oh, please, you're not a follower.
I went back under as the hit man.
can't keep yourself from terrorizing Sara?
no, we're trying to force the suspect into...
why are you still here?
Oh, you have a better wine selection than I do.
love your honesty.
truth is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.
and this malbec is a little dry.
I've got to get back to the bureau.
so, any progress with Sara?
well, she's still camped out in the conference room.
still? Where's she sleeping?
she's sleeping in the conference room?
her bed's tucked into the corner.
she had Jones drag in half her wardrobe.
Oh, guess you can take it with you.
sounds like she's in for the long haul.
I guess. - That can't be fun.
for her or for us? - Either.
the suit can't force her into a hotel?
Peter agreed to this.
she's under protection, so she can't leave the building.
can't crack a window and no room service?
I mean, seriously, who can survive like that?
coffee for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?
heard Halbridge bit.
Yeah. We've got a team at Ridgemont.
how's everything going with you?
I hate this coffee, I hate eating food out of foil, and the air in here is stale.
cabin fever?
I'm very sick of this place.
we should get you some fresh air.
well, that's a little hard when you can't leave the FBI.
Oh, come on.
you got to think outside the box.
the roof.
Yeah, it's still the FBI. - Yeah.
you know the secret to living with rules?
finding ways to bend them?
exactly.
well, go on. I'm fascinated.
I'm not gonna tell you about the painting.
it's too bad.
you know what they say about curiosity.
curiosity can't kill me if I'm already dead.
so, what's it like?
being dead?
so far, it's what I imagine prison must be like.
you're equating prison and death?
I'm sorry. I forgot I was talking to an expert.
cue the violins, Neal. You've got 2 miles.
I have a conference room.
Aww, you're indoors for two days.
I got this for four years.
do you really want to keep doing this?
no, not really.
beautiful. - Yeah.
nothing's changed.
I'm dead.
and the city looks the same.
as far as the world knows, you're no longer in it, but it keeps turning?
Yeah. Certain things...
humble you?
well, I was gonna say "really piss me off," but okay.
Yeah, sure. Humble me.
all right.
Oh, what? Your passing didn't make a big enough splash?
a girl can hope.
parents? - Deceased.
brothers and sisters? - Only child.
goldfish? - No.
what do you want from me, Caffrey?
who says I want anything?
I do. You're a con man.
you smile for a living.
and you're smiling at me right now, so I know that you want something.
all right.
I would love for you to pass me that fortune cookie.
you first.
apparently excitement and intrigue follow me. How about you?
I make delicious soups.
confucius has you pegged.
well, it's true, actually. I do.
yeah?
Hey, Peter. - Got word from surveillance.
Halbridge just hired a crew to do some landscaping at Ridgemont tomorrow morning.
he took the bait? - Yep.
Halbridge is digging up Ridgemont.
I'll toast to that.
stop! Stop! Get that up! Come on, guys.
get the crane over here.
okay, let's see what they found.
let's go. Come on. Quick. We got to get this I need everyone to put their tools down and step 2 feet away from the hole.
put it down, guys.
excuse me.
can't be our bonds.
no. Whatever Halbridge is hiding has been here for years.
he's bound to have more than one skeleton in his closet.
Hey, Burke, open it? - Yeah, go ahead. Get it open.
looks like you were right about those skeletons.
how's the case going?
we're making headway. We just dug up some new evidence.
that was some sort of pun, wasn't it?
I could have also said we found a body of evidence.
I get it. You're very, very funny.
I'm here all week. Don't forget to tip your waitress.
so does that mean that Sara gets to go home?
soon, I hope.
well, have you talked to her?
Yeah, I'm gonna update her now.
no, I meant, have you talked to her?
like a person? - I'm not a shrink.
you've got a pretty good bedside manner, Agent Burke.
don't pretend you don't.
all right. You twisted my arm. I love you.
I love you, too.
how you doing? - Me? I'm good. I'm fine.
it's a nice outfit. Going somewhere?
no. No, I'm just pretending.
dress how you want to feel, right?
Neal came by. We had a nice little chat.
is he in one piece? - Yes, I left him whole.
good. I prefer him that way.
Yeah.
these flowers from him?
um, no. My company sent these to the funeral home. For me.
we had everything forwarded from the funeral home.
it's evidence. - Yeah. It's carnations.
that's all I'm worth. Might as well be weeds.
well, I don't think that's fair to carnations.
I mean, you got to admit, they brighten up the place.
did you find anything at Ridgemont?
a body.
a... whose?
don't know yet. Clothing is from the mid 80s.
looks like a blunt force to the head.
no I. D. No direct links to Halbridge.
okay, well, then, what can I do?
nothing. Tonight you can rest.
that's what you can do.
when this thing is over, you can get back to your life.
maybe find something that doesn't fit in these boxes.
Oh, all right. You're getting paid by the hour now.
okay.
my advice?
get a life. You work too hard.
and you don't?
what is it they say... "we can sleep when we're dead."
that's a good idea. You're dead. So get some rest.
forensics will be here tomorrow, and you can jump back in then.
okay.
all right. I'll make us coffee.
Oh, yeah. - Right?
right. Yeah, the way that "s" moves like that.
Yeah.
Yeah. - It's very similar.
did I miss a memo? - No.
were we starting early, or forensics came back this morning with an I. D. On the body.
And? - You're gonna love this.
the body buried under Ridgemont was identified as one...Halbridge is the corpse?
- Yep.
so the man we know as Edgar Halbridge is an impostor.
Yep. - Who is he then?
we spent the morning comparing a recent signature of Halbridge's to signatures from every Ridgemont apartment lease from the early-to-mid-'80s.
we found a pretty good match.
he was a tenant at Ridgemont at the same time the real Halbridge was living there.
so you think Price killed Halbridge and took his identity? Why?
the real Halbridge had no family, but was coming into some serious cash from an inheritance. Price was poor.
so Price knocks him off and then steals his identity.
Halbridge's body is lying there at Ridgemont, driving Price crazy.
his own tell-tale heart.
pay up. - What?
Peter told me you would bring up the tell-tale heart.
Oh, I'm glad my grasp of Gothic fiction is a source of amusement for you.
he buys the property.
it isn't worth the risk of digging up the body, so he cements over it and makes sure no one ever digs there.
you start poking around Ridgemont, that's why he wants you killed.
I like it. In theory.
Yeah, but that's all it is, a theory.
we've got the signature, but it isn't definitive.
no, if we're gonna prove murder one, we're gonna need more evidence.
thank you. Pay up. - We had a bet.
I told her at some point you'd say we need more evidence.
we do.
and we still don't have the bonds.
what if we could kill two birds, so to speak.
make Halbridge admit he's Steve Price and reveal the bonds?
great. What's the plan?
how would you feel about coming back from the dead?
this was what you found underneath one of my buildings?
it is.
how did they die? - We think it was murder.
unfortunate.
have you had any luck identifying it?
not yet.
we'll know more when the lab work comes back, which takes weeks with older remains like this.
I was hoping that you might be able to help us.
uh, I bought the building 20 years ago.
it's before my time.
there is one thing you might be able to help us with.
I assume you recognize this woman.
do I? - You should. Sara Ellis.
insurance investigator working with Sterling Bosch.
she was investigating you concerning stolen bearer bonds.
Ah, yes. I read about her recent misfortune.
what did she, uh, have to do with this?
does. Present tense.
this photo was taken yesterday. It appears she's alive.
her death was faked.
why would she do that? - I don't know.
but she was the one who tipped us off about the body.
we think that she's working with this man.
you know him?
what's his name?
that may be an alias. We're not sure.
does the name ring a bell?
no.
well, we think these two might be targeting you in some way.
if something comes up, please let me know.
we're here to help.
thank you. - You're welcome.
keep those photos. - I will.
Nico, get in here.
you're getting better at planting bugs than Caffrey.
he's talking? - Yup.
he played me. They both played me.
how did they know about the body i don't know, but they know who I am.
Oh, it's time to move.
got him.
did it work? - It worked. Wine, please.
bringing Sara back from the dead was brilliant.
sterling Bosch released the mail?
you had a very specific syrah here that I wanted to try, but it's gone missing.
I drank it. The pinot is fine. Moz, the mail.
Yes, they released it.
the package from the F. A.A. Containing the cockpit voice recording is now sitting amidst a pile of envelopes on her desk.
or so I was told by a very perky assistant.
good.
so, how are you gonna get it from her?
well, if we take Halbridge down, the first thing Sara's gonna want to do is get out of that FBI building.
an impulse I understand.
sterling Bosch is on the way home.
think she'll stop and pick up her mail?
Yeah, she's a workaholic, and everybody likes mail.
this is true.
to the unopened package and the tantalizing mystery it contains.
you want me to steal it? - She has a gun.
is it still pointing at you?
no, I think I've convinced her I'm not trying to kill her anymore.
well, you are a charmer.
I think I've got a plan that's a little less illegal than breaking and entering.
what do you need? - A car.
you don't drive. - I don't drive often.
do you think the lady will accept a ride from you?
beats packing everything into a cab.
I drink to your charm, sir.
did you get everything you need? - Yes, I did.
thank you, Mr. Price. - Of course.
did this man just remove something from a security box belonging to Steve Price?
Yes.
can I see some I. D?
I think you'll find everything's in order.
excuse me.
where you headed, Steve?
you're under arrest for the murder of Edgar Halbridge.
I wonder what's in here.
goldfish.
these are pretty.
they got them. - Thank God.
I can finally take a shower that doesn't involve a sink.
for some reason, I imagined the FBI had showers somewhere in the building.
it's funny how we have these mental images that don't always match reality.
get me a cab. - I'm headed that way.
you have a car now?
which agent's ride are you about to steal?
borrow. I'll leave a note and everything.
I'll get the Raphael. - Yes.
don't want you to forget it.
you don't pack light, do you?
found a gun on the driver.
any luck on the suitcase with the gun they gave Neal?
nothing. Maybe they dumped it.
keep looking. - Okay.
Where's Mr. Black?
the Canadians are holding him. - Are you sure?
last we checked. - Find out.
Mr. Black... he's here, isn't he?
your boss got a pricey lawyer.
I don't recall him saying you got one.
you want to be charged as an accessory to another murder?
or do you want to talk to me?
Peter! The Canadians released Black 12 hours ago.
they didn't have anything to charge him with.
damn it! He was in your car.
where is he now?
he came back to finish the job.
Where's Sara?
where do you want these?
Oh, um, you can just put them right back there. Thank you.
you know, Neal, for an art thief,Alleged art thief.
Yeah.
for an art thief, you certainly have your moments.
well, I doubt you'll be saying that after a shower and a few hours of sleep.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Oh, brother. It never ends.
what is this?
drop it. Now!
I said drop it!
I'd listen to her if I were you.
get him out of here.
come on. Let's go.
what are you doing here?
she needed a ride.
excitement and intrigue follow me wherever I go.
that's probably true for both of us.
Yeah. Looking forward to trying that soup.
soup?
are we going to Montebello? - Yep.
the times food critic called it the best new restaurant in Manhattan.
yelp gave it three stars.
Wow. They practice molecular gastronomy.
what? - It's a revolution in fine dining where chefs use biochemistry to create new and exotic dishes.
a grill works just fine for me.
every dish is a work of art.
I'm surprised you chose Montebello.
it's expensive. - I'm impressed.
Oh, we're not eating there.
okay, Peter, this is like me taking you to Yankee stadium and then listening to the game in the parking lot.
it's a meeting place. I didn't pick it.
who did? - The insurance investigator.
Oh, insurance? Great.
someone stole $100 million in Japanese bearer bonds.
samurai bonds. Nice.
that's what they're call on the street.
Oh, now I've got your interest.
so who's the investigator?
she has a suspect here in Manhattan.
she? Wait, wait. Is it?
no. It is?
Yeah. Yeah.
agent Burke, it's nice to see you.
Neal Caffrey. It's been a while.
Sara. Nearly five years since you testified at my trial. Against me.
well, you did steal a painting insured by my employer for several million dollars.
not according to a jury of my peers.
I thought all your peers were in prison.
a few of us managed to stay out. - I could fix that.
sorry to break up this happy reunion, but we're here to talk about the samurai bonds.
that's what they call them out on the street.
well, we're not here to talk about them, we're here to find them.
a girl's got to make a living.
well, my fees are based on recovery, so, yeah.
Sara? - My company, Sterling Bosch, insured a hundred million in non-government Japanese bearer bonds.
a hundred million yen or U. S. dollars? - Dollars.
and if you recover them? - 2%.
the truck was hijacked in transport, and I think the bonds are somewhere here in New York.
she believes Edgar Halbridge is involved.
Biinternational real-estate guy.
he can move them without raising flags.
Yes, he can. Excuse me.
Hi! Emilio's just inside.
thank you so much. - You're welcome.
Hey, you! That's my car! Get away from it!
Emilio, listen to me.
you can change the Vin numbers, you can change the grill, the paint.
it's still a Mercedes SLR.
I know, because you did not change the electronic Vin behind the steering wheel.
you're crazy! You're just stealing my car!
no. You stole it. I'm taking it back.
don't make a scene.
you can file a complaint with my friend from the FBI.
Hey. Hi, there.
special Agent Burke, FBI.
this is just a misunderstanding. I should just...
you should stop walking and put your hand above your head.
Yeah, running just annoys him.
so you're basically a high-class repo man.
well, I prefer white-collar bounty hunter.
you should put that on your business card.
this is a limited edition SLR, worth $450, 000.
making your cut $9, 000.
not a bad score on your lunch break.
no, it's not. Speaking of business cards...
when you feel like turning in that Raphael, please call me.
I wouldn't wait by the phone.
see you tomorrow Caffrey.
so happy to have you back in my life.
it's clear.
come on.
Hey, you okay? - Yeah.
Yeah, Kate was sitting on the left side by the window.
definitely no accident.
did you ever think it was? - No.
a mechanical failure wouldn't cause an explosion by the door.
I bet it was set to explode the plane in mid-air.
it went off early.
or someone set it off early.
what about the black box?
the whole tail's missing.
excuse me! Who are you?
you said the guard's route takes 15 minutes. - That's not the guard.
all right. Just follow me on this one.
what are you doing in here? - Morning. We're with Sterling Bosch.
you're Roy? - Where you been, Roy?
unlike you, we're on a schedule here.
sterling Bosch? Insurance?
Yeah.
no one told me you were coming.
I thought Wentlow Sterlings was handling the claim.
they were. Where's the cockpit voice recorder?
Oh, that's been logged in with NTSB in Washington.
I hope you made a backup.
insurance? - Just trust me on this one.
listen, how'd you guys get in here?
we walked in. - Your security is abysmal.
we have one guard for four hangars.
good to know.
listen, we made a copy of the voice recording.
I only handle the physical evidence.
I don't have access to the recording.
when's our flight leave? - Two hours.
I can have F. A.A. Send a copy to you.
that would work. - Yeah, I guess that would work.
I'll have them send it to, uh, Sterling Bosch. What's your name?
you know what, why don't you have them send it to my insurance investigator, Sara Ellis.
I can do that. - Great. I'll follow up with a call tomorrow morning.
all right. Ask for my assistant. I'll give her a heads up.
Thanks, Roy. - Yeah, bye, Roy.
Hey, we'll get it. - Yeah.
who's Sara Ellis?
Oh, you weren't at my trial. She was.
Yeah.
she testified against me.
I testified against you.
Oh, that's different. How can I work with her?
I'm the cunning art thief who slipped through her fingers.
I don't think she used those words.
no, but she looks at me and sees dollar signs.
she's gonna come after me again for that Raphael.
do you have it?
okay. There's a hundred million stolen bonds out there.
she knows this case better than anybody.
right now, we're on the same team, so play nice.
she... I... - No. Don't.
but... Fine. - Good.
start a conversation.
Sara, I feel like we got off on the wrong foot. Let's start over.
you want to be friends? - Why not?
okay, what? Coffee? Grab a bite?
sure. - How about dinner?
or maybe a movie? You like classics, right?
good memory.
are you worried about her and Neal? - Not at all.
you name the date, Neal.
I would love to spend time with you.
anything to keep you talking.
you're recording me?
everything you say to me can and will be used to nail your ass to the wall and recover my painting.
everything okay, Neal?
what's that?
I could get used to this.
okay, people.
you know Sara Ellis, from Sterling Bosch.
thanks to her Intel, we have subpoenaed coded e-mails between an alias we think is Edgar Halbridge and a man in hamburg he calls Mr. Black.
the e-mails use a public-key encryption.
we've cracked most of them.
we believe Mr. Black is a courier.
Halbridge has paid him a one-time fee to enter the U. S.
and get the bonds out of the country.
the bonds are transferable?
no title. Whoever holds them owns them.
each certificate is worth 200 grand.
so a stack of $100 million is this thick?
Halbridge is taking a huge risk using a courier.
I'd take the risk.
our plan is to intercept Mr. Black when he transfers planes in Toronto.
then we put Neal into his place here in Manhattan.
thank you for the heads up.
you said you cracked most of the e-mails.
what's in the one's you haven't? - Don't know.
Halbridge won't recognize Mr. Black?
from the vernacular of the e-mails, we think he's an American ex-pat.
the last e-mail says Black will be the guy wearing a leather jacket and carrying a copy of "atlas shrugged,
which tells me he doesn't know what he looks like.
let's make this happen.
you're welcome.
for what? - Oh, I recover the bonds, and your cut is $2 million.
see, I thought the bureau needed me, - given their recovery rate is less than 1 in 20. - Is that true?
that's the bureau's recovery rate. Not mine.
canadian authorities have detained Mr. Black in Toronto but left his name on the flight manifest to JFK.
as far as Halbridge is concerned, Black lands in an hour.
we've duplicated his wardrobe and every item he had on him.
diesel jacket, leather wallet, and copy of...
atlas shrugged. Mr. Black's a lone wolf.
german chocolate.
not a fan of the bittersweet.
from the airport, you'll take a cab to fort Green.
you'll wait there for a car to pick you up.
the location's open. We'll be back eight blocks.
we can't get closer without risking our cover.
GPS tracker and voice transmitter in the watch.
we'll be behind you.
as soon as you see those bonds, we move in on him.
what's the activation phrase?
you'll say,"long flight," and we'll be there.
long flight.
should I be getting a recovery fee, because Sara gets 2% and I feel like I'm doing the heavy lifting.
move.
I'm standing alone by a waste treatment plant.
sexy. We got him?
GPS signal is locked.
car coming.
here we go.
black limo. Arriving from the South.
got Mr. Black.
I'll confirm when the job is complete.
everything is as you requested,Your gloves, your briefcase.
what happened?
we lost the signal.
is everything in order?
that is the correct gun?
Yeah.
no GPS, no audio.
what do you mean? Did he do that or did we?
neither. Looks like someone's jamming it.
sure was a long flight.
what was that, sir?
Oh, I... I said,It sure was a long flight.
Ruger Mark Ⅱ with tactical solutions receiver.
red dot holographic sight. Good.
as you requested.
we still don't have a visual.
get eyes on him. Neal said he arrived from the South. Let's use that.
call NYPD. See if we can rush in one of their helicopters.
couldn't carry this with me on my long flight, could I?
everything else is in place.
that's fantastic.
okay, get a visual on the black limo.
Halbridge's office is in midtown and he lives on the upper West Side.
send a team to both.
NYPD can get a chopper in the air in five minutes.
otherwise we're flying blind.
great. They've got a head start, and we are looking for a black limo somewhere in Brooklyn.
everything all right, Mr. Black?
how much farther? - We're close.
target's on the first floor.
I'm here if there's any resistance.
stay here.
keep the engine running.
any time you guys want to break that safe distance you're maintaining,
I'd appreciate it.
he's back up.
have I mentioned how long my flight was?
lawrence of Arabia" long.
he's giving us the takedown signal. Where is he?
GPS is coming up.
I hope you guys are close 'cause I think I'm supposed to kill somebody.
did he say "kill somebody"?
I'm walking into a house with a loaded gun.
please stop me.
my driver has a gun, also. If I don't do this, he might, so I'm going to go through with this until you get here.
found him. 8602 2nd street, park slope.
get a team there now! Who lives there?
Oh, God. - Go! Go!
Freeze! - Wait! Don't shoot!
why did he say,"don't shoot"?
because she's gonna kill him.
this is because I won't let the Raphael go.
no, it's not. This isn't what it looks like.
it looks like you're here to kill me.
okay, it is what it looks like. I was sent here to kill you.
look, Mr. Black from hamburg isn't a courier.
he's an assassin. - Right.
there's a driver outside. He's armed.
he may come in here if he doesn't see muzzle flashes.
I can make that happen.
that's probably Peter.
look, I'm putting the gun down.
answer the phone.
this better be Peter.
it is. Tell me you haven't shot Caffrey yet.
no, not yet. - The flight was long, Peter!
who wants me dead?
Peter, is that true? - It looks that way, yes.
we can arrest the driver outside.
work him to get to Halbridge.
that doesn't guarantee we'll recover the bonds.
what do you suggest?
let him think I'm dead.
congratulations, Caffrey.
you've killed me.
it's done. Let's go.
what about the gun?
I left it in the briefcase for the driver to dispose of.
I know, but apparently that was part of my plan.
we intercepted the e. M.T.'S and NYPD.
we put out reports that she's confirmed dead.
where is Sara now?
jones was taking her to the safe house.
I took her to the safe house. She didn't want to stay.
why not? - Gentlemen. Neal.
you're really redefining business casual.
hardly recognized you without the ruger.
you should step out.
I think I'll step out.
my files on Halbridge. Please put them in there.
first things first. I need pants.
Jones, find her some pants.
what are you doing? You okay?
it's been a rough night. You should get some rest.
we'll talk on the way to the safe house.
I'm good. - You're staying?
Peter, I was woken out of a dead sleep by Neal Caffrey standing over me with a gun.
I would love to be somewhere I could trust.
any progress on the pants?
here's your bag.
thank you.
where are you gonna sleep? - I will be fine.
something about an attempt on your life really gets the blood flowing, like a double shot of red bull and espresso.
I think I just invented a drink.
you boys got any scotch?
get a cot. Bring it up here. - You got it.
it's been a while since somebody wanted me dead.
don't look so surprised.
the question is why does Halbridge want me dead?
which means what's so special about you?
I play a mean cello.
I work for Sterling Bosch. I can be replaced.
kill me, another investigator takes over, and Halbridge knows that.
so, honestly, why me?
Sara. We'll figure this out.
we are gonna get this guy.
how's the coffee around here? We have a lot of work to do.
you were supposed to be here an hour ago.
Yeah, well, we can't all spend our nights sipping wine on my couch.
not with that attitude, you can't.
I was a little busy posing as a professional killer.
as you said.
are you tipsy? - A little bit.
Where's the cockpit recording?
I checked with Roy's office.
the package from the F. A.A. Arrived at Sterling Bosch earlier today, care of Sara Ellis.
so what happened? Where is it now?
you went and killed her is what happened.
it's under lock and key while they investigate her "death."
okay. I'll find a way into Sterling Bosch.
look, your best chance is to wait until sleeping beauty awakens from her dirt nap and snag it then.
I'm guessing you're not her favorite person at this moment?
no. - Then I would suggest cozying up to her.
she put a gun in my face.
and cocked it? - Yeah.
you've come back from worse.
love what you've done with the place.
what do you want, Caffrey?
look, I feel bad about last night, so I bought you a housewarming gift.
I know how much you've been wanting this.
the Raphael you stole.
no. But it's a nice print of a stolen Raphael.
says so right here. - Homey.
Yeah, I mean, we're working closely on this case...
Really?
are we gonna keep doing this? - Really. Keep talking.
cause I can go on all day. - Please.
Hey, kids. Playing nice?
Neal brought me a gift. - Ah, the Raphael.
cute. - He wants something.
I can't get you a present?
when someone like you gets someone like me a gift, there's a reason.
Peter, what do you think Neal wants?
he's never given me a present.
I sent you birthday cards.
wasn't a present. Do you want something from Ms. Ellis?
I want her to stop pointing guns at me.
that can be arranged. Sit.
let's talk about Halbridge.
Sara, why do you think he wants you out of the way?
I don't know.
what do you have in your files that we don't have?
well, I dug deep.
um, stocks, security, all his land holdings.
tenant lease agreements.
we've already seen all that.
I believe so.
Mr. Black. When was the first e-mail sent to him?
good. Figure out when he arranged the hit?
Yeah. Yeah.
all right. Here it is.
five weeks ago, what were you digging into?
five weeks ago?
this.
Ridgemont is an apartment complex on West End Avenue.
it was the first place that Halbridge lived when he came to New York.
he bought it for nostalgia? - It's a classic six.
maybe Halbridge is into pre-war architecture.
maybe, but he's renovated all his other properties except for Ridgemont.
there's something there he doesn't want to let go of.
Yeah, and you should ask him.
doubt he'll discuss it with the FBI.
do you think he'd talk to Mr. Black?
if you have a weapon, I'll take it.
I don't.
I'm gonna check.
get your hands off me.
it's all right, Nico.
what is so important that you need to see me in person?
you want to do this in front of him?
I'm more comfortable that he stays.
did you enjoy your trip to New York?
it isn't over yet.
it should be.
your business, as I understand it, is complete.
not quite.
I'm here to talk about Ridgemont.
that supposed to mean something?
you hired me to kill a woman.
this conversation is over.
I asked myself,"why kill her?
she must mean something to you.
so before I took care of her, we had a little talk, and she had a lot to say about Ridgemont apartments.
if you're insinuating that I had some woman killed, what makes you think that I won't have you killed right where you sit?
that crossed my mind.
here's what happens now.
you're going to transfer $2 million into my account.
you got 48 hours, or the FBI gets a call telling them to look into any connection between you and Ridgemont apartments.
liquidating $2 million in assets will take some time.
you're a wealthy and resourceful man. You'll think of something.
if I don't?
you got a lot more to lose than I do.
we were right.
Ridgemont was the way in.
good. Jones, Diana, keep monitoring Halbridge's phones and assets.
there are plenty of places to plant a bug in his house.
if you want to go that way.
you're playing with guns. I'm not letting you back in there.
just letting that simmer.
what happens if he actually transfers the $2 mil to Mr. Black?
it'll be a good day for Mr. Black.
I've got a team watching Ridgemont.
if Halbridge makes a move, we'll figure out what's so important in there.
now, explain to me why your hair was slicked back.
amateur production of "grease"?
I do think you'd make a sublime Danny Zuko.
Oh, not Kenickie?
Oh, please, you're not a follower.
I went back under as the hit man.
can't keep yourself from terrorizing Sara?
no, we're trying to force the suspect into...
why are you still here?
Oh, you have a better wine selection than I do.
love your honesty.
truth is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.
and this malbec is a little dry.
I've got to get back to the bureau.
so, any progress with Sara?
well, she's still camped out in the conference room.
still? Where's she sleeping?
she's sleeping in the conference room?
her bed's tucked into the corner.
she had Jones drag in half her wardrobe.
Oh, guess you can take it with you.
sounds like she's in for the long haul.
I guess. - That can't be fun.
for her or for us? - Either.
the suit can't force her into a hotel?
Peter agreed to this.
she's under protection, so she can't leave the building.
can't crack a window and no room service?
I mean, seriously, who can survive like that?
coffee for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?
heard Halbridge bit.
Yeah. We've got a team at Ridgemont.
how's everything going with you?
I hate this coffee, I hate eating food out of foil, and the air in here is stale.
cabin fever?
I'm very sick of this place.
we should get you some fresh air.
well, that's a little hard when you can't leave the FBI.
Oh, come on.
you got to think outside the box.
the roof.
Yeah, it's still the FBI. - Yeah.
you know the secret to living with rules?
finding ways to bend them?
exactly.
well, go on. I'm fascinated.
I'm not gonna tell you about the painting.
it's too bad.
you know what they say about curiosity.
curiosity can't kill me if I'm already dead.
so, what's it like?
being dead?
so far, it's what I imagine prison must be like.
you're equating prison and death?
I'm sorry. I forgot I was talking to an expert.
cue the violins, Neal. You've got 2 miles.
I have a conference room.
Aww, you're indoors for two days.
I got this for four years.
do you really want to keep doing this?
no, not really.
beautiful. - Yeah.
nothing's changed.
I'm dead.
and the city looks the same.
as far as the world knows, you're no longer in it, but it keeps turning?
Yeah. Certain things...
humble you?
well, I was gonna say "really piss me off," but okay.
Yeah, sure. Humble me.
all right.
Oh, what? Your passing didn't make a big enough splash?
a girl can hope.
parents? - Deceased.
brothers and sisters? - Only child.
goldfish? - No.
what do you want from me, Caffrey?
who says I want anything?
I do. You're a con man.
you smile for a living.
and you're smiling at me right now, so I know that you want something.
all right.
I would love for you to pass me that fortune cookie.
you first.
apparently excitement and intrigue follow me. How about you?
I make delicious soups.
confucius has you pegged.
well, it's true, actually. I do.
yeah?
Hey, Peter. - Got word from surveillance.
Halbridge just hired a crew to do some landscaping at Ridgemont tomorrow morning.
he took the bait? - Yep.
Halbridge is digging up Ridgemont.
I'll toast to that.
stop! Stop! Get that up! Come on, guys.
get the crane over here.
okay, let's see what they found.
let's go. Come on. Quick. We got to get this I need everyone to put their tools down and step 2 feet away from the hole.
put it down, guys.
excuse me.
can't be our bonds.
no. Whatever Halbridge is hiding has been here for years.
he's bound to have more than one skeleton in his closet.
Hey, Burke, open it? - Yeah, go ahead. Get it open.
looks like you were right about those skeletons.
how's the case going?
we're making headway. We just dug up some new evidence.
that was some sort of pun, wasn't it?
I could have also said we found a body of evidence.
I get it. You're very, very funny.
I'm here all week. Don't forget to tip your waitress.
so does that mean that Sara gets to go home?
soon, I hope.
well, have you talked to her?
Yeah, I'm gonna update her now.
no, I meant, have you talked to her?
like a person? - I'm not a shrink.
you've got a pretty good bedside manner, Agent Burke.
don't pretend you don't.
all right. You twisted my arm. I love you.
I love you, too.
how you doing? - Me? I'm good. I'm fine.
it's a nice outfit. Going somewhere?
no. No, I'm just pretending.
dress how you want to feel, right?
Neal came by. We had a nice little chat.
is he in one piece? - Yes, I left him whole.
good. I prefer him that way.
Yeah.
these flowers from him?
um, no. My company sent these to the funeral home. For me.
we had everything forwarded from the funeral home.
it's evidence. - Yeah. It's carnations.
that's all I'm worth. Might as well be weeds.
well, I don't think that's fair to carnations.
I mean, you got to admit, they brighten up the place.
did you find anything at Ridgemont?
a body.
a... whose?
don't know yet. Clothing is from the mid 80s.
looks like a blunt force to the head.
no I. D. No direct links to Halbridge.
okay, well, then, what can I do?
nothing. Tonight you can rest.
that's what you can do.
when this thing is over, you can get back to your life.
maybe find something that doesn't fit in these boxes.
Oh, all right. You're getting paid by the hour now.
okay.
my advice?
get a life. You work too hard.
and you don't?
what is it they say... "we can sleep when we're dead."
that's a good idea. You're dead. So get some rest.
forensics will be here tomorrow, and you can jump back in then.
okay.
all right. I'll make us coffee.
Oh, yeah. - Right?
right. Yeah, the way that "s" moves like that.
Yeah.
Yeah. - It's very similar.
did I miss a memo? - No.
were we starting early, or forensics came back this morning with an I. D. On the body.
And? - You're gonna love this.
the body buried under Ridgemont was identified as one...Halbridge is the corpse?
- Yep.
so the man we know as Edgar Halbridge is an impostor.
Yep. - Who is he then?
we spent the morning comparing a recent signature of Halbridge's to signatures from every Ridgemont apartment lease from the early-to-mid-'80s.
we found a pretty good match.
he was a tenant at Ridgemont at the same time the real Halbridge was living there.
so you think Price killed Halbridge and took his identity? Why?
the real Halbridge had no family, but was coming into some serious cash from an inheritance. Price was poor.
so Price knocks him off and then steals his identity.
Halbridge's body is lying there at Ridgemont, driving Price crazy.
his own tell-tale heart.
pay up. - What?
Peter told me you would bring up the tell-tale heart.
Oh, I'm glad my grasp of Gothic fiction is a source of amusement for you.
he buys the property.
it isn't worth the risk of digging up the body, so he cements over it and makes sure no one ever digs there.
you start poking around Ridgemont, that's why he wants you killed.
I like it. In theory.
Yeah, but that's all it is, a theory.
we've got the signature, but it isn't definitive.
no, if we're gonna prove murder one, we're gonna need more evidence.
thank you. Pay up. - We had a bet.
I told her at some point you'd say we need more evidence.
we do.
and we still don't have the bonds.
what if we could kill two birds, so to speak.
make Halbridge admit he's Steve Price and reveal the bonds?
great. What's the plan?
how would you feel about coming back from the dead?
this was what you found underneath one of my buildings?
it is.
how did they die? - We think it was murder.
unfortunate.
have you had any luck identifying it?
not yet.
we'll know more when the lab work comes back, which takes weeks with older remains like this.
I was hoping that you might be able to help us.
uh, I bought the building 20 years ago.
it's before my time.
there is one thing you might be able to help us with.
I assume you recognize this woman.
do I? - You should. Sara Ellis.
insurance investigator working with Sterling Bosch.
she was investigating you concerning stolen bearer bonds.
Ah, yes. I read about her recent misfortune.
what did she, uh, have to do with this?
does. Present tense.
this photo was taken yesterday. It appears she's alive.
her death was faked.
why would she do that? - I don't know.
but she was the one who tipped us off about the body.
we think that she's working with this man.
you know him?
what's his name?
that may be an alias. We're not sure.
does the name ring a bell?
no.
well, we think these two might be targeting you in some way.
if something comes up, please let me know.
we're here to help.
thank you. - You're welcome.
keep those photos. - I will.
Nico, get in here.
you're getting better at planting bugs than Caffrey.
he's talking? - Yup.
he played me. They both played me.
how did they know about the body i don't know, but they know who I am.
Oh, it's time to move.
got him.
did it work? - It worked. Wine, please.
bringing Sara back from the dead was brilliant.
sterling Bosch released the mail?
you had a very specific syrah here that I wanted to try, but it's gone missing.
I drank it. The pinot is fine. Moz, the mail.
Yes, they released it.
the package from the F. A.A. Containing the cockpit voice recording is now sitting amidst a pile of envelopes on her desk.
or so I was told by a very perky assistant.
good.
so, how are you gonna get it from her?
well, if we take Halbridge down, the first thing Sara's gonna want to do is get out of that FBI building.
an impulse I understand.
sterling Bosch is on the way home.
think she'll stop and pick up her mail?
Yeah, she's a workaholic, and everybody likes mail.
this is true.
to the unopened package and the tantalizing mystery it contains.
you want me to steal it? - She has a gun.
is it still pointing at you?
no, I think I've convinced her I'm not trying to kill her anymore.
well, you are a charmer.
I think I've got a plan that's a little less illegal than breaking and entering.
what do you need? - A car.
you don't drive. - I don't drive often.
do you think the lady will accept a ride from you?
beats packing everything into a cab.
I drink to your charm, sir.
did you get everything you need? - Yes, I did.
thank you, Mr. Price. - Of course.
did this man just remove something from a security box belonging to Steve Price?
Yes.
can I see some I. D?
I think you'll find everything's in order.
excuse me.
where you headed, Steve?
you're under arrest for the murder of Edgar Halbridge.
I wonder what's in here.
goldfish.
these are pretty.
they got them. - Thank God.
I can finally take a shower that doesn't involve a sink.
for some reason, I imagined the FBI had showers somewhere in the building.
it's funny how we have these mental images that don't always match reality.
get me a cab. - I'm headed that way.
you have a car now?
which agent's ride are you about to steal?
borrow. I'll leave a note and everything.
I'll get the Raphael. - Yes.
don't want you to forget it.
you don't pack light, do you?
found a gun on the driver.
any luck on the suitcase with the gun they gave Neal?
nothing. Maybe they dumped it.
keep looking. - Okay.
Where's Mr. Black?
the Canadians are holding him. - Are you sure?
last we checked. - Find out.
Mr. Black... he's here, isn't he?
your boss got a pricey lawyer.
I don't recall him saying you got one.
you want to be charged as an accessory to another murder?
or do you want to talk to me?
Peter! The Canadians released Black 12 hours ago.
they didn't have anything to charge him with.
damn it! He was in your car.
where is he now?
he came back to finish the job.
Where's Sara?
where do you want these?
Oh, um, you can just put them right back there. Thank you.
you know, Neal, for an art thief,Alleged art thief.
Yeah.
for an art thief, you certainly have your moments.
well, I doubt you'll be saying that after a shower and a few hours of sleep.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Oh, brother. It never ends.
what is this?
drop it. Now!
I said drop it!
I'd listen to her if I were you.
get him out of here.
come on. Let's go.
what are you doing here?
she needed a ride.
excitement and intrigue follow me wherever I go.
that's probably true for both of us.
Yeah. Looking forward to trying that soup.
soup?
I gave you the box, Kate, and I never hear from you again.
here. I don't need all the heat this is gonna bring.
I deciphered the phone number that Kate dialed from the plane.
I traced it to a store-bought burner phone.
so no names associated with it.
not yet.
whatever this thing's hiding, it's not the music.
I think it's a keyhole.
a key to what?
that's the last piece of the music box.
I'm giving up my obsession.
are you suggesting I give up mine?
marshals monitor the anklet.
Yes, one of these keys goes to your anklet.
I know who Kate called from the plane.
it was the FBI agent who set up the deal between you and Kate.
now I need to find him.
is this a good idea?
you have a better one?
no.
you think Mozzie can do this?
Oh, he is a savant when it comes to things like this.
rain man. I get it.
you should see him with a rubik's cube.
probably can do it with his feet, right?
30 seconds, socks on or off.
this is the single greatest day of his life.
Yep. All the conspiracy theories have come true.
we've been so close, and now we finally meet.
I told you. - I agreed with you.
no, there's no shushing.
no shushing for you.
you ready to record this?
Yes, but...
first walk me through it.
all right. Pay attention.
this is where it gets good.
we noticed this broken piece...
wasn't broken.
it's a keyhole.
Yep.
and this is the key.
there's a second comb.
Yep.
we snap it into place.
you ready?
Yeah.
any idea what kind of code it is?
sounds could correspond to numbers, wavelengths.
Pala's discovery of hidden music in "the last supper."
Runescape's encoded flute solo!
don't forget "close encounters."
geographical coordinates encoded In five tones.
very good, suit.
clearly we're in good hands.
Yeah.
what are you doing?
I'm getting this out of harm's way.
and I am keeping this.
that's a good idea.
if we defang the box, we can use it to lure out Fowler.
no way.
tomorrow, you and me.
it's back to business as usual.
business as usual.
us without the box.
down.
how old is this code?
hard to say.
the last credible report has the box disappearing from konigsberg castle in '45.
now, assuming no one has reunited the cherub and the box since then...
wait, wait.
the box and the key were together the day we stole it.
she had them both before she brought the box back to me.
well, she obviously inserted the key and found the comb.
so why'd she give it back?
couldn't solve it herself?
or she took something out of it.
or she knows something we don't.
she could be a step ahead of us.
Yeah.
we really should talk to her.
it's too bad she disappeared to Italy.
maybe.
you know where Alex is, don't you?
I have an idea.
how did Mozzie do?
better than I expected.
I'm convinced. He's the cherub for the job.
and what about Neal?
how's he doing with all this?
I don't know if he's interested in the music box.
I think he just wants to find Fowler.
see what he knows about Kate's death.
well, speaking of Fowler, we got a blip on the radar.
an old bank account.
someone checked the balance.
can you trace it?
no. It was done remotely.
200 bucks in the account?
Yeah, he emptied his accounts when he went underground, but he didn't get much.
maybe he's desperate for cash.
what are you thinking?
do you know about his wife's death?
she was killed during a robbery a few years ago.
back when he was working violent crimes for the bureau.
suspicious circumstances surrounded her murder.
that kept the insurance company from finalizing their claim.
we could make it look like the claim finally came through.
put a stack of cash in the account.
if he bites, we can track the withdrawal.
in the meantime, make sure that stays safe.
what bushes did you rustle to uncover Alex's trail?
remember that silver collection she fenced a few years ago?
the Spanish pieces from the Almiranta shipwreck?
they're popping up again, one at a time.
I don't like loitering.
I really appreciate this.
so, what happened to your goatee?
you know I liked it.
we all grow up.
all children...
except one.
did you bring it?
it's from the Almiranta.
who's the fence?
anonymous.
the thief?
it's the third piece of shipwreck silver I've had come through this month.
someone's been busy.
too busy.
I like that "someone." So you should warn her the nypd is on the trail.
if they make the Almiranta connection...
understood.
what do I owe you for this?
we all go way back.
just remember me fondly when you pull the next job.
well, that might be a while.
or it might not.
he thinks it's Alex...
she knows how valuable this stuff is,
and she knows where it is.
she's stealing back her own stuff.
when the nypd realizes it's all from the same collection...
they'll set a trap.
unless we get to her first.
Oh, that would take FBI resources we don't have access to.
I can get those.
how?
I con the FBI.
Peter said it's time to get back to business as usual.
following standard Peter protocol,
that means he'll try to pull from the reserve of active case files, which I am allowed to take home and peruse.
exhibits "a," I presume?
Yes.
they range from mortgage fraud to copyright infringement back to mortgage fraud.
sorry, I just dozed off.
I know.
but Peter always tries to find a diamond in the rough.
so you want to create a diamond for him to find.
exactly.
if we can forge a case file linking the silver thefts, He won't be able to resist it.
and then he'll think he found the case himself.
it's brilliant!
Hello, hello. - June.
sorry to interrupt your project, but I will be leaving town for a few days, so, as per our agreement...
Oh, you want me to walk Bugsy.
please. He loves your company.
you got it.
okay. Thank you.
Bye-bye, you two.
uh, so she has you dog whispering?
small price to pay.
where were we?
Hale told us when the silver pieces started coming in,
we know Alex's M. O.
and I created this.
you named Alex "the silver burglar"?
all right, I admit it lacks a certain flair.
but it makes the point.
it includes the police reports for the stolen items, and I've added just enough FBI research to connect the dots.
uh, your file's a tad too nice to have been floating around the bureau.
so we age it.
just like a painting.
get in the mind of the file.
live the life of the file.
hear the pulse of the file!
can we do this? - Please.
step one - The case file is assembled by our clerk, Janice.
she merges all the various reports...
probably over lunch.
she logs in the police reports and staples them together.
looks like she forgot a page.
nice.
now, our probee usually brings her coffee.
it's an excuse to flirt.
Oh, he's left-handed.
then it goes to Susan, who highlights the pertinents.
Oh, she's the eau de parfum?
she is.
what are you doing?
this is the first burglary victim.
Susan sees the name and then starts humming.
Mr. Gordon?
he was a county commissioner.
commissioner Gordon.
Batman
no one will know what song you hummed when we did this.
live the file.
next.
then it gets approved by Hughes.
now, his signature is tricky.
he has his assistant sign for him...
so...
forging the forger.
nicely done.
now it gets passed around the office a few times.
nice one.
now I slip it in with the rest of the files.
u. S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation - Hey, honey. - Hey, hon.
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
good.
he's in trouble.
Ooh, chinese.
Yeah. Satchmo got into the quiche I made.
bad dog.
thank you.
Oh, so the reserve box, huh?
looking for your next case?
Yeah, it's time for Neal and me to get back to basics.
want to help?
no.
good.
all right, what do we got?
antitrust lawsuit.
Yeah. Does that sound interesting?
no, actually, boring.
all right. Let's see...
medicare scam.
okay, well, you sighed, so we're gonna pass on that one.
Oh, look at this one.
cat burglar.
that's kind of sexy.
someone smells good.
that would be susan.
let me see that.
Oh, yeah.
look good?
this should do the trick.
Oh, I know that look.
you got your eye on a new bad guy.
Ah, got our next case.
what do you know about stolen Spanish silver?
do you even have to ask?
Oh, just once I wish I did.
a silver thief.
I've heard good things.
thought you might like this.
cat burglary. Love it.
why are you humming?
something in the file. Popped into my head.
all right, settle down, kids.
NYPD has been investigating a series of silver heists.
the thief breaks through the window and then cleans out the place.
but here's what nypd missed.
all the thefts included at least one piece from a 17th-century shipwreck,
the Almiranta.
if we can figure out who else owns pieces from that shipwreck...
we can predict who's gonna be hit next.
now, insurance policies are giving us three potential targets.
we're gonna stake out all of them.
this couple called in a vacation watch to their alarm company.
they'll be gone for a week starting tomorrow.
that's a lot of lonely silver.
then that's the address we'll take.
this should be fun.
Batman
you were right.
we got a hit.
Fowler's insurance settlement.
deposited yesterday. A portion was withdrawn within 40 minutes.
ATM?
on 32nd street.
I did a radius check, pulled traffic cams near the area - Got these.
Hello, Garrett.
Yep. I'm heading out to take a look.
Diana, last time Fowler...
tried to shoot me?
Yeah, I'm not gonna give him another chance.
easy! Amadeus.
additive code...
morse, baudot...
set theory, logarithmic, and geographic
every kind of cipher. Unless, um...
means something to you, then it's still just noise.
is there anyone who can help you with this?
there's one guy.
he works at an antique store in the west 30s.
code breaker? - Code maker.
has a rep for hiding codes in gadgets.
government job?
Yes. Just not our government.
and you trust him?
well, I trust him enough To play him a partial piece of it And not tell him where it came from.
maybe Alex will have our answers.
Oh, sure. Perhaps she decoded it already using a stolen silver tea set.
how are you gonna talk to Alex, anyway?
the FBI's staking out a penthouse.
she always does rooftop recon one block away.
tell her I said "ciao."
will do.
Where's Caffrey?
Oh his way.
he was staying in short-term housing a block from that ATM.
the clerk I. D.'d him off the pictures.
he's going by the name Aaron Burgis. He left two days ago.
any hits on that alias?
Yeah. And it's a big one.
Semtex Class AA Explosives
you sure it's Fowler?
are you gonna tell Neal?
I don't know if he can handle it.
they're on vacation in Miami.
look down.
to the right.
the municipal utility van.
you're looking very "to catch a thief" tonight.
I hope you don't think I'm the little french girl and you're Cary Grant in this scenario.
I'd like to think there are similarities.
but I'm not here to turn you in.
right.
you were just in the neighborhood.
if I could reach you like a regular person, maybe it wouldn't have to be this way.
sorry. It's kind of hard to keep in touch With this bull's-eye on my back.
so you come out at night to steal the things you fenced, then fence them again?
I don't have the luxury to be creative.
who else knows I'm here?
just me and Moz.
Oh, and the nypd if you keep going.
they're close to linking the thefts, Alex.
I used my friends in the van to get to you first.
Why?
the music box.
you found the code.
tell me you cracked it.
I'm lurking on a rooftop, spying into people's windows.
do you think I cracked it?
I can get that target off your back once and for all.
how?
hit somewhere else tonight.
what's my take?
the music box.
deja vu, Neal. We've done this.
third time's a charm.
the box is sitting in a safe in Diana Barrigan's apartment.
who is she?
FBI agent.
you want me to break into a fed's apartment?
she's sitting down in that van right now.
and her girlfriend works the night shift.
girlfriend? That must kill you.
so what do I do with it once I get it?
return it to the rightful owners.
give it to the Russian museum.
the person who wants it will take his eye off you and put it on them.
what do you say?
you're already dressed for it.
Fowler just became the priority.
I need you to look into everything Fowler did with this alias, leading up to the explosion and after.
off the normal channels?
stay away from the office. Can you work from home?
I prefer it.
good.
where are you going?
I'm headed home.
Why? Why?
I thought we were all surveiling tonight.
you guys are fine without me.
Oh, come on. But it's the van.
the van's fun.
you hate the van.
I like the van when Diana's in it.
you're the only thing that smells good in here.
then take your last whiff, because I'm leaving.
all right, Diana has more important things to do than be your potpourri.
besides...
I have something important I need to tell you.
what's up?
you won't admit it, you won't show it,
but I know how difficult these last few months have been to you.
I'm glad that you trusted me.
of course.
I'm returning the favor.
this is a receipt for parts used In making the bomb on Kate's plane.
it says the buyer's name is Aaron Burgis.
do you know who that is?
it's Fowler's alias.
Diana tracked his purchases and found that.
made one week before the explosion.
Fowler bought the explosives and put them on the plane.
you okay?
Yeah.
we're closing in on Fowler.
Diana has a lead.
good.
Neal. - Good.
access Granted
are you okay?
I'm not surprised.
part of me knew it had to be Fowler.
if we get him now, we can put him away.
is Neal with you?
Yes. What's going on?
someone just broke into my house.
the music box is gone.
what?
don't do this, Neal.
tell me you didn't do this.
do what?
tell me you didn't steal the music box.
what are you talking about? I'm right here.
it's been safe in Diana's apartment for months, And the minute I tell you about it, it disappears.
I didn't take it.
you're not gonna get away with this.
you're not.
long Lost Russian Music Box Mysteriously Returned to Museum
russian heritage museum received an anonymous gift.
seems an antique music box was left in their delivery drop.
they're doing a public showing Sunday?
by invitation only, before they ship it back to st. Petersburg.
Thanks.
get up here.
wish me luck.
you knew the Russians would want to show this off.
you're trying to lure Fowler out.
someone is.
Oh, would you stop?
you can skip the viewing.
Oh, no. I'll be there, but you won't.
you can't pull me off this, Peter.
I can do whatever I want with you.
you're lucky that I don't put you in lockdown.
get out.
Konnichiwa, my friend.
I have something very intriguing for you.
Oh, yes. It is.
um, can you make a copy?
of course.
got my eyes on you.
this is a surprise.
you come here to add to your stuffed-squirrel collection?
well, let's just say my day opened up.
how did your black-on-black affair go?
I found Alex. - That's good.
she has no idea how to solve the code.
that's bad.
and I got benched by Peter.
what happened?
I had Alex steal the box from Diana and donate it to the Russians.
Oh, God. You're trying to draw him out.
Fowler bought the explosives that blew up Kate's plane.
Oh, Neal.
very interesting.
Oh, excellent. He can help us.
Two-parter.
two-part code.
interesting idea.
we can each take half.
as they say, divide and conquer.
brilliant mind.
Akihiro, you flatter me.
what he said was
Yeah, I-I heard him.
Oh, yeah. Okay. Sure.
um, a-are you okay?
Yeah. Moz, I'm fine.
I'm gonna head home.
ja ne. - Ja ne.
russian heritage museum is invitation only, and they're sticking to that.
I pulled this from municipal archives.
we can stake out the building.
if Fowler shows up, we grab him outside.
all right, listen.
I want Neal's anklet monitored continuously.
you think he'll try something?
Neal wants Fowler more than I do, and I can't let that happen.
are you in place?
I've got eyes on the front entrance.
Where's Caffrey?
he's at home.
let's hope the little guy's there to keep an eye on him.
how do I look?
don't answer that.
you're inscrutable.
you know that, Bugsy?
they say accessories make the outfit.
you buy it?
Peter, I see Fowler.
he's coming your way.
hello.
nice to see you.
invitation, please?
Fowler just entered the building.
I'm going after him.
stay on the entrance.
invitation, please.
FBI. I'm investigating that man you just let in without one.
sir...
you can't go up there.
I am a federal agent. Where do these stairs lead?
the modernist gallery. It's closed for renovations.
it's locked. Do you have a key?
Fowler, open up!
you don't know what you're messing with!
let me try this key.
surrender, Fowler, right now!
let it go, burke!
get that thing open.
Neal, we've had a breakthrough of unforeseen magnitude.
Akihiro's run-on haiku paired with my rejection of predetermined
does June know you're up here?
Oh, benjamin siegelbaum.
what has he done?
hello. - Suit, we have a code red.
now is not the time, Mozzie.
it's a dark day when I turn towards the system instead of recoiling.
just spit it out!
remember when you asked me to tell you If Neal was gonna do something stupid?
well, I regretfully report...
that he's out of his anklet.
damn it.
but that's not the "stupid" part.
he's got a gun.
Neal is manipulating his tracking signal.
I'm sure he's close. He's armed.
if you see him, pursue.
got it.
Neal, what are you doing?
thank you.
you got a party crasher out front.
Yeah. - Caffrey got past me. He's inside.
I'm going after him.
damn it!
no.
is anybody coming?
now, there was a time - Yeah. - He's upstairs.
stop him.
you got nowhere to go.
Caffrey's in there.
he's with Fowler.
I have five shots left.
that's the only warning you get.
whatever you think happ... - tell me why you killed Kate!
you blew up the plane to get rid of us!
no.
what was in it for you?
Jesus, Caffrey, you think you're the only one that lost something?
don't play with me, Fowler.
you think I wanted to spend the last year of my life chasing you and a stupid box?
it cost me everything!
my career is over.
my wife is gone.
stay out of this, Peter!
Neal, put the gun down!
Neal, don't do this!
you know he killed Kate.
I didn't kill her.
who did? - I'm...
what do you know?
tell me what you know!
you want to kill me, Neal?
go ahead and pull the trigger.
Jesus, Fowler, you're not helping this.
Neal, do not do this.
I know you killed her.
you killed Kate.
listen to me.
if you pull that trigger, you will regret it for the rest of your life, Neal.
you're not a killer.
I want him to know how it felt.
how she felt.
look at me.
look at me, Neal.
Neal. Look at me, Neal.
come on.
this isn't who you are.
cuff him.
how are we gonna handle this?
call Jones.
you two can handle the official bureau response.
take him back to the office, then I'll figure out what to do next.
did you kill her?
no.
you're gonna tell me who did.
I was just like you, burke.
moving up in the bureau.
beautiful wife.
things were good then.
your wife was murdered.
Yeah.
did my best to put the pieces back together,
but all I could think about was vengeance.
then out of the blue one day, I get a phone call, anonymous voice,
pointing me right to her killer.
so I tracked him down.
and you killed him.
a few days later, I get a package in the mail.
it's a video.
of what you had done.
followed by another phone call.
man tells me he can arrange it for me to be transferred into opr.
Opr?
Yeah.
he had enough clout to make that happen?
Yeah.
is he with the bureau?
I don't know.
after that, he told me If I could get him the music box, the video would disappear.
give it to your mystery blackmailer...
get your life back.
that was our deal.
so I traced the box to Caffrey.
but he didn't have it.
well, everyone thought he did.
but he was in prison.
so you went after Kate.
I figured she'd know where you kept it.
you're the man with the ring.
she was signaling you with her ATM card that day, huh?
Yeah.
it worked.
why'd you buy the explosives?
Oh, that was Kate's idea.
look, I set up your getaway...
as part of mentor.
Oh, mentor was real?
Yeah.
Kate felt that no matter how far away you two got, you would never be safe.
and I don't think she was wrong.
Hey, look...
I don't know who the guy is pulling these strings,
but I have never seen anyone with the kind of juice he has.
so it was her idea to blow up the plane?
Yeah. You two bail out over the water.
boom.
fake our death and live happily ever after.
the bomb exploded early. Why?
I don't know.
she called you from the plane.
we heard it on the cockpit recording.
Kate never called me.
your name was listed on the phone.
I'm not that stupid.
boss? - Yeah?
the marshals reset the key.
put it on him. Take him home.
Peter, not right now.
go home.
so, what's gonna happen to me?
I haven't decided.
you want to help me?
the flash drive I got from you the day that I...
the day you shot me?
Yeah.
it contained the date, time, and place of a meeting.
who were you meeting?
I had been trying forever to get to the guy pulling the strings.
I had finally gotten a meeting with the intermediary.
what was the name of the guy you were meeting?
I don't know. I was gonna find out that day.
you didn't know it?
no.
I was there.
what?
did you see him?
no. He was good.
he dodged my cameras.
I never got a clear look at him, but...
I got this.
you know him?
Yeah.
we trained together in special forces.
you didn't know he was involved in this?
no, I haven't seen him in years.
that's our patchwork man.
excuse me.
what's going on?
NYPD just called in a homicide In an antique shop downtown.
the same antique shop where Neal got his gun.
rule out a snatch and grab?
two shots to the chest.
as far as we can tell, nothing was taken.
that was playing when we came in.
I'll check it out.
what the hell's going on?
shop owner was working on the codes.
turn that off.
let me see that.
Eureka!
he must have figured something out.
when you're done with this, it comes to me.
how about surveillance tapes?
the gunman was smart.
knew to avoid the cameras.
but this is interesting.
surveillance tape was cued up to some earlier footage.
he's the next target.
what the hell's going on?!
Hi, Neal.
can I come in?
sure.
come on in.
Neal, pick up!
keep trying.
are you gonna answer that?
no.
is the target officially off my back?
whoever wants the box knows you don't have it now.
well, it'll be nice to stop prowling around rooftops for a paycheck.
what about you?
did you get what you need?
I found Fowler.
but I still don't know who killed Kate.
and the code?
Moz will crack it.
I chased that music box for a long time, Neal.
I almost feel guilty I brought you in.
Oh, come on. I forced my way in.
true, but that's just what we do.
it's kind of sad.
it's all coming to an end.
Freeze!
hands where I can see them!
may I?
my number.
from now on, I'll answer it.
see you around, Neal.
I thought we sent you to Italy, Alex.
snuck back in.
you are quick on your feet.
like a cat.
that silver around your neck - Spanish, by chance?
don't know.
see you around.
you want to explain the guns?
someone killed Akihiro Tanaka.
we thought they were headed here next.
Why?
surveillance tapes at the antique shop...
paused on your image.
well, I wasn't there alone.
sir?
what happened?
have a great day.
I gave you the box, Kate, and I never hear from you again.
here. I don't need all the heat this is gonna bring.
I deciphered the phone number that Kate dialed from the plane.
I traced it to a store-bought burner phone.
so no names associated with it.
not yet.
whatever this thing's hiding, it's not the music.
I think it's a keyhole.
a key to what?
that's the last piece of the music box.
I'm giving up my obsession.
are you suggesting I give up mine?
marshals monitor the anklet.
Yes, one of these keys goes to your anklet.
I know who Kate called from the plane.
it was the FBI agent who set up the deal between you and Kate.
now I need to find him.
is this a good idea?
you have a better one?
no.
you think Mozzie can do this?
Oh, he is a savant when it comes to things like this.
rain man. I get it.
you should see him with a rubik's cube.
probably can do it with his feet, right?
30 seconds, socks on or off.
this is the single greatest day of his life.
Yep. All the conspiracy theories have come true.
we've been so close, and now we finally meet.
I told you. - I agreed with you.
no, there's no shushing.
no shushing for you.
you ready to record this?
Yes, but...
first walk me through it.
all right. Pay attention.
this is where it gets good.
we noticed this broken piece...
wasn't broken.
it's a keyhole.
Yep.
and this is the key.
there's a second comb.
Yep.
we snap it into place.
you ready?
Yeah.
any idea what kind of code it is?
sounds could correspond to numbers, wavelengths.
Pala's discovery of hidden music in "the last supper."
Runescape's encoded flute solo!
don't forget "close encounters."
geographical coordinates encoded In five tones.
very good, suit.
clearly we're in good hands.
Yeah.
what are you doing?
I'm getting this out of harm's way.
and I am keeping this.
that's a good idea.
if we defang the box, we can use it to lure out Fowler.
no way.
tomorrow, you and me.
it's back to business as usual.
business as usual.
us without the box.
down.
how old is this code?
hard to say.
the last credible report has the box disappearing from konigsberg castle in '45.
now, assuming no one has reunited the cherub and the box since then...
wait, wait.
the box and the key were together the day we stole it.
she had them both before she brought the box back to me.
well, she obviously inserted the key and found the comb.
so why'd she give it back?
couldn't solve it herself?
or she took something out of it.
or she knows something we don't.
she could be a step ahead of us.
Yeah.
we really should talk to her.
it's too bad she disappeared to Italy.
maybe.
you know where Alex is, don't you?
I have an idea.
how did Mozzie do?
better than I expected.
I'm convinced. He's the cherub for the job.
and what about Neal?
how's he doing with all this?
I don't know if he's interested in the music box.
I think he just wants to find Fowler.
see what he knows about Kate's death.
well, speaking of Fowler, we got a blip on the radar.
an old bank account.
someone checked the balance.
can you trace it?
no. It was done remotely.
200 bucks in the account?
Yeah, he emptied his accounts when he went underground, but he didn't get much.
maybe he's desperate for cash.
what are you thinking?
do you know about his wife's death?
she was killed during a robbery a few years ago.
back when he was working violent crimes for the bureau.
suspicious circumstances surrounded her murder.
that kept the insurance company from finalizing their claim.
we could make it look like the claim finally came through.
put a stack of cash in the account.
if he bites, we can track the withdrawal.
in the meantime, make sure that stays safe.
what bushes did you rustle to uncover Alex's trail?
remember that silver collection she fenced a few years ago?
the Spanish pieces from the Almiranta shipwreck?
they're popping up again, one at a time.
I don't like loitering.
I really appreciate this.
so, what happened to your goatee?
you know I liked it.
we all grow up.
all children...
except one.
did you bring it?
it's from the Almiranta.
who's the fence?
anonymous.
the thief?
it's the third piece of shipwreck silver I've had come through this month.
someone's been busy.
too busy.
I like that "someone." So you should warn her the nypd is on the trail.
if they make the Almiranta connection...
understood.
what do I owe you for this?
we all go way back.
just remember me fondly when you pull the next job.
well, that might be a while.
or it might not.
he thinks it's Alex...
she knows how valuable this stuff is,
and she knows where it is.
she's stealing back her own stuff.
when the nypd realizes it's all from the same collection...
they'll set a trap.
unless we get to her first.
Oh, that would take FBI resources we don't have access to.
I can get those.
how?
I con the FBI.
Peter said it's time to get back to business as usual.
following standard Peter protocol,
that means he'll try to pull from the reserve of active case files, which I am allowed to take home and peruse.
exhibits "a," I presume?
Yes.
they range from mortgage fraud to copyright infringement back to mortgage fraud.
sorry, I just dozed off.
I know.
but Peter always tries to find a diamond in the rough.
so you want to create a diamond for him to find.
exactly.
if we can forge a case file linking the silver thefts, He won't be able to resist it.
and then he'll think he found the case himself.
it's brilliant!
Hello, hello. - June.
sorry to interrupt your project, but I will be leaving town for a few days, so, as per our agreement...
Oh, you want me to walk Bugsy.
please. He loves your company.
you got it.
okay. Thank you.
Bye-bye, you two.
uh, so she has you dog whispering?
small price to pay.
where were we?
Hale told us when the silver pieces started coming in,
we know Alex's M. O.
and I created this.
you named Alex "the silver burglar"?
all right, I admit it lacks a certain flair.
but it makes the point.
it includes the police reports for the stolen items, and I've added just enough FBI research to connect the dots.
uh, your file's a tad too nice to have been floating around the bureau.
so we age it.
just like a painting.
get in the mind of the file.
live the life of the file.
hear the pulse of the file!
can we do this? - Please.
step one - The case file is assembled by our clerk, Janice.
she merges all the various reports...
probably over lunch.
she logs in the police reports and staples them together.
looks like she forgot a page.
nice.
now, our probee usually brings her coffee.
it's an excuse to flirt.
Oh, he's left-handed.
then it goes to Susan, who highlights the pertinents.
Oh, she's the eau de parfum?
she is.
what are you doing?
this is the first burglary victim.
Susan sees the name and then starts humming.
Mr. Gordon?
he was a county commissioner.
commissioner Gordon.
Batman
no one will know what song you hummed when we did this.
live the file.
next.
then it gets approved by Hughes.
now, his signature is tricky.
he has his assistant sign for him...
so...
forging the forger.
nicely done.
now it gets passed around the office a few times.
nice one.
now I slip it in with the rest of the files.
u. S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation - Hey, honey. - Hey, hon.
Hey, buddy. How you doing?
good.
he's in trouble.
Ooh, chinese.
Yeah. Satchmo got into the quiche I made.
bad dog.
thank you.
Oh, so the reserve box, huh?
looking for your next case?
Yeah, it's time for Neal and me to get back to basics.
want to help?
no.
good.
all right, what do we got?
antitrust lawsuit.
Yeah. Does that sound interesting?
no, actually, boring.
all right. Let's see...
medicare scam.
okay, well, you sighed, so we're gonna pass on that one.
Oh, look at this one.
cat burglar.
that's kind of sexy.
someone smells good.
that would be susan.
let me see that.
Oh, yeah.
look good?
this should do the trick.
Oh, I know that look.
you got your eye on a new bad guy.
Ah, got our next case.
what do you know about stolen Spanish silver?
do you even have to ask?
Oh, just once I wish I did.
a silver thief.
I've heard good things.
thought you might like this.
cat burglary. Love it.
why are you humming?
something in the file. Popped into my head.
all right, settle down, kids.
NYPD has been investigating a series of silver heists.
the thief breaks through the window and then cleans out the place.
but here's what nypd missed.
all the thefts included at least one piece from a 17th-century shipwreck,
the Almiranta.
if we can figure out who else owns pieces from that shipwreck...
we can predict who's gonna be hit next.
now, insurance policies are giving us three potential targets.
we're gonna stake out all of them.
this couple called in a vacation watch to their alarm company.
they'll be gone for a week starting tomorrow.
that's a lot of lonely silver.
then that's the address we'll take.
this should be fun.
Batman
you were right.
we got a hit.
Fowler's insurance settlement.
deposited yesterday. A portion was withdrawn within 40 minutes.
ATM?
on 32nd street.
I did a radius check, pulled traffic cams near the area - Got these.
Hello, Garrett.
Yep. I'm heading out to take a look.
Diana, last time Fowler...
tried to shoot me?
Yeah, I'm not gonna give him another chance.
easy! Amadeus.
additive code...
morse, baudot...
set theory, logarithmic, and geographic
every kind of cipher. Unless, um...
means something to you, then it's still just noise.
is there anyone who can help you with this?
there's one guy.
he works at an antique store in the west 30s.
code breaker? - Code maker.
has a rep for hiding codes in gadgets.
government job?
Yes. Just not our government.
and you trust him?
well, I trust him enough To play him a partial piece of it And not tell him where it came from.
maybe Alex will have our answers.
Oh, sure. Perhaps she decoded it already using a stolen silver tea set.
how are you gonna talk to Alex, anyway?
the FBI's staking out a penthouse.
she always does rooftop recon one block away.
tell her I said "ciao."
will do.
Where's Caffrey?
Oh his way.
he was staying in short-term housing a block from that ATM.
the clerk I. D.'d him off the pictures.
he's going by the name Aaron Burgis. He left two days ago.
any hits on that alias?
Yeah. And it's a big one.
Semtex Class AA Explosives
you sure it's Fowler?
are you gonna tell Neal?
I don't know if he can handle it.
they're on vacation in Miami.
look down.
to the right.
the municipal utility van.
you're looking very "to catch a thief" tonight.
I hope you don't think I'm the little french girl and you're Cary Grant in this scenario.
I'd like to think there are similarities.
but I'm not here to turn you in.
right.
you were just in the neighborhood.
if I could reach you like a regular person, maybe it wouldn't have to be this way.
sorry. It's kind of hard to keep in touch With this bull's-eye on my back.
so you come out at night to steal the things you fenced, then fence them again?
I don't have the luxury to be creative.
who else knows I'm here?
just me and Moz.
Oh, and the nypd if you keep going.
they're close to linking the thefts, Alex.
I used my friends in the van to get to you first.
Why?
the music box.
you found the code.
tell me you cracked it.
I'm lurking on a rooftop, spying into people's windows.
do you think I cracked it?
I can get that target off your back once and for all.
how?
hit somewhere else tonight.
what's my take?
the music box.
deja vu, Neal. We've done this.
third time's a charm.
the box is sitting in a safe in Diana Barrigan's apartment.
who is she?
FBI agent.
you want me to break into a fed's apartment?
she's sitting down in that van right now.
and her girlfriend works the night shift.
girlfriend? That must kill you.
so what do I do with it once I get it?
return it to the rightful owners.
give it to the Russian museum.
the person who wants it will take his eye off you and put it on them.
what do you say?
you're already dressed for it.
Fowler just became the priority.
I need you to look into everything Fowler did with this alias, leading up to the explosion and after.
off the normal channels?
stay away from the office. Can you work from home?
I prefer it.
good.
where are you going?
I'm headed home.
Why? Why?
I thought we were all surveiling tonight.
you guys are fine without me.
Oh, come on. But it's the van.
the van's fun.
you hate the van.
I like the van when Diana's in it.
you're the only thing that smells good in here.
then take your last whiff, because I'm leaving.
all right, Diana has more important things to do than be your potpourri.
besides...
I have something important I need to tell you.
what's up?
you won't admit it, you won't show it,
but I know how difficult these last few months have been to you.
I'm glad that you trusted me.
of course.
I'm returning the favor.
this is a receipt for parts used In making the bomb on Kate's plane.
it says the buyer's name is Aaron Burgis.
do you know who that is?
it's Fowler's alias.
Diana tracked his purchases and found that.
made one week before the explosion.
Fowler bought the explosives and put them on the plane.
you okay?
Yeah.
we're closing in on Fowler.
Diana has a lead.
good.
Neal. - Good.
access Granted
are you okay?
I'm not surprised.
part of me knew it had to be Fowler.
if we get him now, we can put him away.
is Neal with you?
Yes. What's going on?
someone just broke into my house.
the music box is gone.
what?
don't do this, Neal.
tell me you didn't do this.
do what?
tell me you didn't steal the music box.
what are you talking about? I'm right here.
it's been safe in Diana's apartment for months, And the minute I tell you about it, it disappears.
I didn't take it.
you're not gonna get away with this.
you're not.
long Lost Russian Music Box Mysteriously Returned to Museum
russian heritage museum received an anonymous gift.
seems an antique music box was left in their delivery drop.
they're doing a public showing Sunday?
by invitation only, before they ship it back to st. Petersburg.
Thanks.
get up here.
wish me luck.
you knew the Russians would want to show this off.
you're trying to lure Fowler out.
someone is.
Oh, would you stop?
you can skip the viewing.
Oh, no. I'll be there, but you won't.
you can't pull me off this, Peter.
I can do whatever I want with you.
you're lucky that I don't put you in lockdown.
get out.
Konnichiwa, my friend.
I have something very intriguing for you.
Oh, yes. It is.
um, can you make a copy?
of course.
got my eyes on you.
this is a surprise.
you come here to add to your stuffed-squirrel collection?
well, let's just say my day opened up.
how did your black-on-black affair go?
I found Alex. - That's good.
she has no idea how to solve the code.
that's bad.
and I got benched by Peter.
what happened?
I had Alex steal the box from Diana and donate it to the Russians.
Oh, God. You're trying to draw him out.
Fowler bought the explosives that blew up Kate's plane.
Oh, Neal.
very interesting.
Oh, excellent. He can help us.
Two-parter.
two-part code.
interesting idea.
we can each take half.
as they say, divide and conquer.
brilliant mind.
Akihiro, you flatter me.
what he said was
Yeah, I-I heard him.
Oh, yeah. Okay. Sure.
um, a-are you okay?
Yeah. Moz, I'm fine.
I'm gonna head home.
ja ne. - Ja ne.
russian heritage museum is invitation only, and they're sticking to that.
I pulled this from municipal archives.
we can stake out the building.
if Fowler shows up, we grab him outside.
all right, listen.
I want Neal's anklet monitored continuously.
you think he'll try something?
Neal wants Fowler more than I do, and I can't let that happen.
are you in place?
I've got eyes on the front entrance.
Where's Caffrey?
he's at home.
let's hope the little guy's there to keep an eye on him.
how do I look?
don't answer that.
you're inscrutable.
you know that, Bugsy?
they say accessories make the outfit.
you buy it?
Peter, I see Fowler.
he's coming your way.
hello.
nice to see you.
invitation, please?
Fowler just entered the building.
I'm going after him.
stay on the entrance.
invitation, please.
FBI. I'm investigating that man you just let in without one.
sir...
you can't go up there.
I am a federal agent. Where do these stairs lead?
the modernist gallery. It's closed for renovations.
it's locked. Do you have a key?
Fowler, open up!
you don't know what you're messing with!
let me try this key.
surrender, Fowler, right now!
let it go, burke!
get that thing open.
Neal, we've had a breakthrough of unforeseen magnitude.
Akihiro's run-on haiku paired with my rejection of predetermined
does June know you're up here?
Oh, benjamin siegelbaum.
what has he done?
hello. - Suit, we have a code red.
now is not the time, Mozzie.
it's a dark day when I turn towards the system instead of recoiling.
just spit it out!
remember when you asked me to tell you If Neal was gonna do something stupid?
well, I regretfully report...
that he's out of his anklet.
damn it.
but that's not the "stupid" part.
he's got a gun.
Neal is manipulating his tracking signal.
I'm sure he's close. He's armed.
if you see him, pursue.
got it.
Neal, what are you doing?
thank you.
you got a party crasher out front.
Yeah. - Caffrey got past me. He's inside.
I'm going after him.
damn it!
no.
is anybody coming?
now, there was a time - Yeah. - He's upstairs.
stop him.
you got nowhere to go.
Caffrey's in there.
he's with Fowler.
I have five shots left.
that's the only warning you get.
whatever you think happ... - tell me why you killed Kate!
you blew up the plane to get rid of us!
no.
what was in it for you?
Jesus, Caffrey, you think you're the only one that lost something?
don't play with me, Fowler.
you think I wanted to spend the last year of my life chasing you and a stupid box?
it cost me everything!
my career is over.
my wife is gone.
stay out of this, Peter!
Neal, put the gun down!
Neal, don't do this!
you know he killed Kate.
I didn't kill her.
who did? - I'm...
what do you know?
tell me what you know!
you want to kill me, Neal?
go ahead and pull the trigger.
Jesus, Fowler, you're not helping this.
Neal, do not do this.
I know you killed her.
you killed Kate.
listen to me.
if you pull that trigger, you will regret it for the rest of your life, Neal.
you're not a killer.
I want him to know how it felt.
how she felt.
look at me.
look at me, Neal.
Neal. Look at me, Neal.
come on.
this isn't who you are.
cuff him.
how are we gonna handle this?
call Jones.
you two can handle the official bureau response.
take him back to the office, then I'll figure out what to do next.
did you kill her?
no.
you're gonna tell me who did.
I was just like you, burke.
moving up in the bureau.
beautiful wife.
things were good then.
your wife was murdered.
Yeah.
did my best to put the pieces back together,
but all I could think about was vengeance.
then out of the blue one day, I get a phone call, anonymous voice,
pointing me right to her killer.
so I tracked him down.
and you killed him.
a few days later, I get a package in the mail.
it's a video.
of what you had done.
followed by another phone call.
man tells me he can arrange it for me to be transferred into opr.
Opr?
Yeah.
he had enough clout to make that happen?
Yeah.
is he with the bureau?
I don't know.
after that, he told me If I could get him the music box, the video would disappear.
give it to your mystery blackmailer...
get your life back.
that was our deal.
so I traced the box to Caffrey.
but he didn't have it.
well, everyone thought he did.
but he was in prison.
so you went after Kate.
I figured she'd know where you kept it.
you're the man with the ring.
she was signaling you with her ATM card that day, huh?
Yeah.
it worked.
why'd you buy the explosives?
Oh, that was Kate's idea.
look, I set up your getaway...
as part of mentor.
Oh, mentor was real?
Yeah.
Kate felt that no matter how far away you two got, you would never be safe.
and I don't think she was wrong.
Hey, look...
I don't know who the guy is pulling these strings,
but I have never seen anyone with the kind of juice he has.
so it was her idea to blow up the plane?
Yeah. You two bail out over the water.
boom.
fake our death and live happily ever after.
the bomb exploded early. Why?
I don't know.
she called you from the plane.
we heard it on the cockpit recording.
Kate never called me.
your name was listed on the phone.
I'm not that stupid.
boss? - Yeah?
the marshals reset the key.
put it on him. Take him home.
Peter, not right now.
go home.
so, what's gonna happen to me?
I haven't decided.
you want to help me?
the flash drive I got from you the day that I...
the day you shot me?
Yeah.
it contained the date, time, and place of a meeting.
who were you meeting?
I had been trying forever to get to the guy pulling the strings.
I had finally gotten a meeting with the intermediary.
what was the name of the guy you were meeting?
I don't know. I was gonna find out that day.
you didn't know it?
no.
I was there.
what?
did you see him?
no. He was good.
he dodged my cameras.
I never got a clear look at him, but...
I got this.
you know him?
Yeah.
we trained together in special forces.
you didn't know he was involved in this?
no, I haven't seen him in years.
that's our patchwork man.
excuse me.
what's going on?
NYPD just called in a homicide In an antique shop downtown.
the same antique shop where Neal got his gun.
rule out a snatch and grab?
two shots to the chest.
as far as we can tell, nothing was taken.
that was playing when we came in.
I'll check it out.
what the hell's going on?
shop owner was working on the codes.
turn that off.
let me see that.
Eureka!
he must have figured something out.
when you're done with this, it comes to me.
how about surveillance tapes?
the gunman was smart.
knew to avoid the cameras.
but this is interesting.
surveillance tape was cued up to some earlier footage.
he's the next target.
what the hell's going on?!
Hi, Neal.
can I come in?
sure.
come on in.
Neal, pick up!
keep trying.
are you gonna answer that?
no.
is the target officially off my back?
whoever wants the box knows you don't have it now.
well, it'll be nice to stop prowling around rooftops for a paycheck.
what about you?
did you get what you need?
I found Fowler.
but I still don't know who killed Kate.
and the code?
Moz will crack it.
I chased that music box for a long time, Neal.
I almost feel guilty I brought you in.
Oh, come on. I forced my way in.
true, but that's just what we do.
it's kind of sad.
it's all coming to an end.
Freeze!
hands where I can see them!
may I?
my number.
from now on, I'll answer it.
see you around, Neal.
I thought we sent you to Italy, Alex.
snuck back in.
you are quick on your feet.
like a cat.
that silver around your neck - Spanish, by chance?
don't know.
see you around.
you want to explain the guns?
someone killed Akihiro Tanaka.
we thought they were headed here next.
Why?
surveillance tapes at the antique shop...
paused on your image.
well, I wasn't there alone.
sir?
what happened?
have a great day.
it's late. - Yeah.
that's not supposed to be one of Monet's lost frames?
no, just trying to clear my head.
good. About that.
Vincent Adler -- Seven years ago, he ran a huge ponzi scheme and disappeared with a billion dollars.
you knew him?
he's the man who made me who I am today.
he's rained hell down on both our lives.
you knew. You knew, and you didn't say anything?
I just figured it out myself, okay?
I'm trying to reconcile the Adler I knew - with the man responsible for -- For Kate?
for Mozzie? - Yeah. So let's get him.
come on.
start talking.
Yeah, I'm not much of a beer drinker, so
I know. That's why I brought you this.
I don't recognize the bottle.
that's because it cost as much as the beer.
I don't even need a corkscrew.
Nope. Okay.
now... How do you know Adler? - It's a long story.
if we are gonna catch this guy, just like I caught you, - I need to know everything. - There's too much to tell.
you're gonna plead the fifth?
a few secrets are good, Peter -- Keeps the mystery alive.
I get it.
this story includes some stuff about crimes I don't know about.
Yeah. -No. You're not holding back on me.
we've got all night. I'll make you a deal.
full immunity for anything you say from this moment until the sun rises over that balcony.
full immunity?
did you kill anybody? - No.
then full immunity.
all right. Let's start with this.
Mozzie decoded the music box. It's an equation.
this is what it built.
it's a fractal. - Very good.
I've seen one like it before. - Where?
in vincent Adler's office when I worked for him.
how did you meet him?
if you want to know about Adler, we got to start with Mozzie.
why am I not surprised?
it was eight years ago. I was new to the city, didn't know the east village from the west.
all right, follow the lady.
all you got to do is follow the lady.
I mix them fast, but if your eyes are faster, you win -- Simple as that.
lady's in the middle.
you got good peepers, pal.
want to double up, buddy? - Sure.
toss them. - Okay.
you think you can follow them, but I'm saying that you can't. It's all a game of you vs. Me.
all right, here we go, here we go.
where is she? Where is she?
watch her. Watch her.
she's a sneaky lady, but I think she likes you.
she's on the right. - No, she's back in the middle.
are you crazy? She's definitely on the right.
it's his money, kid.
crap. she's sneaking around on you, boss.
lucky guess.
you're so good at this, why don't you put your own money down?
you gonna bet or walk away.
you!
what you got?
all right.
$50? Come on, really take this guy.
time to put up or shut up, kid.
it's up to you.
all right. Let's go $500.
now we're talking.
all right, looks like I hooked me a whale here.
looky, looky, looky, hey, diddle, diddle, the queen's in the middle. Follow her fast. Follow her slow.
my hands are fast. Your eyes are slow.
see her? See her?
pick that little lady and you win, my man.
all you got to do is show me the smile on the lady's face, and you walk away with it all.
you sure? - Yeah. He's sure.
I'm sure.
fun game, man. Thank you.
you toss the broads really well.
damn it!
Cado, you want to earn 10 bucks? - $20.
Seriously? - You gonna stiff me this time?
go, you little weasel. Follow that guy.
he's in my traing program.
I'm the guy from the park.
Hey, I'm not here to give you hospital time, kid.
good,'cause I'm not giving you your money back.
keep it.
what's your angle?
look, I been running find-the-lady for years, and even I didn't catch that swap.
Where's your partner? - I left him.
Why? - I need an upgrade.
Mozzie had a goatee?
well, only to distract from his toupee.
we talked. Moz told me about his detroit days.
he'd been running street cons since he was a kid.
notice my lack of surprise.
what does any of this have to do with Adler?
well, he's the reason Mozzie found me.
these forgeries are exquisite.
who says it's a forgery?
given your living conditions, I do.
how did you match the tricolor seal?
just eyeballed it. - By eye?
you are very talented, kid.
with you as my partner, we could move way beyond the street hustle.
what did you have in mind?
a long con, which, if executed properly, would enable us to purchase and retire on neighboring temperate-zone islands in a mere six months.
I just got to this city, and I'm too young to retire.
I'm talking about summiting the everest of swindles.
who's the mark?
Vincent Adler? - Yeah.
now this is getting good.
that was the first time I heard Adler's name.
what?
those bonds -- that's the first time I'd come across you.
Really? Tell me.
you're stalling. - No, I'm not. Come on.
we got -- we got a long time until sunrise.
we got plenty of beer and...this.
so tell me.
did you have to fight to take my case?
Yeah. It was a real tug-of-war.
here's another one for you, Peter.
stop hoarding all the new cases, Burke.
bond forgery sent over from nypd.
two phony atlantic incorporated bonds in six months.
what? You want it?
two in half a year?
atlantics have never been forged.
I'll pass. - All right.
this is quality work.
so is my kid's drawing on the fridge.
he's all yours. - Okay.
I think this guy has a future.
what was my Nickname?
what? -Come on. Every case gets a Nickname.
Hagen was the dutchman before you i. d.'d him.
what was my nickname?
don't recall. - That's too bad.
well, the sooner you rember, the sooner we can move on.
James bonds. - Bonds.
James bonds. - James bonds.
Yes, yes. Would you like another beer? - Yeah.
shaken, not stirred?
see, I knew it was a mistake telling you.
believe me, yours was just one file in a giant stack of cases.
but it was on top.
you weren't that good.
this guy's good.
honey, come on -- Are we gonna put this away, - or is that our new coffee table? - Oh, I'm sorry.
what about this one is getting under your skin?
you really want to hear about this?
well, of course, always. - All right.
he's tampering with federal evidence.
that's a forgery?
the seal, the signature, the security strip.
see, most forgers are only experts at one aspect.
the man who forged this bond is capable of bigger things.
he can do it all. - Well, so can you.
lose the 'stache? - Yeah, sorry, magnum.
I still love you. - I love you, too.
Satchmo -- Elizabeth named him?
how do you know I didn't?
well, elizabeth likes old jazz. You don't.
don't forget I knew a fair amount about you before it was over.
know thine enemy.
know thyself, and you will win a hundred battles.
Mozzie's influence? - Big student of history.
tell me how you went after Adler.
he was a big fish.
there he is, our white whale.
what did you find out about him?
well, he's the c. e.o. of Adler financial management, - and he runs their top hedge fund. - Good.
What'd he bring in?
I don't know. - Never say that. Know everything.
Adler made $150 million last year, up 8% from the prior year.
know thine enemy, and you will win -- sun tzu.
all right. What's the con?
well, Adler routes a hefty percentage of his profits into an account in the caymans every six months.
Tax-free? - Exactly.
all we need to reroute his next wire transfer is two pieces of information
account number and password.
that's where you come in.
where does he keep it -- Personal safe, deposit box?
in his head. He's too smart to keep it anywhere else.
I can't just walk up and ask him for it. That's impossible.
a wise man once said it's fun to do the impossible.
bertrand russell? - Walt disney.
you should read more.
our clock is five months.
you'll ingratiate yourself, become a trusted friend, then convince him to tell you.
why don't you do it?
I'm more the behind-the-scenes guy.
all right, look at me, and then look in the mirror.
who has a better chance of charming Adler at the charity dinner on friday?
the antiquities recovery project?
it's five grand a plate. I can't afford that.
well, you can if you cash in a few more of your bonds.
big mistake.
cashing those bonds was a calculated risk.
but it was worth it for the con we were about to run on Adler.
Yeah, but bankrolling them got us our first visual on you.
if I recall, I wasn't the only one who made a mistake that day.
no, hang on, hang on.
Yeah, it was that bank in midtown.
did you get it? - Yep.
the teller was a sweetheart.
Oh, she gave you a sucker.
you know, the irony of that would not be lost on alanis morissette.
this guy's a forger. He's good.
what? Brooks brothers suit.
Yes, I understand. - So?
so that means fed -- Talking to the bank manager.
we got to go.
...these bonds, I want you to call me immediately.
never met a fed before. - Let's keep it that way.
detain him if possible. - Absolutely.
good. - Excuse me.
sorry, I-I couldn't help but overhear. Are you with the fbi?
special agent Peter Burke.
I - I just took some money out of the bank, and you heard you talking about counterfeiting.
your money's safe. I'm looking after counterfeit bonds.
well, I have some bonds at home.
how would I know if they're not real?
I'm sure they're fine.
well, thanks again for all the hard work you're doing, agent Burke.
that's for you. Have a good day.
he's not a nanny goat in a petting zoo. He's a fed.
within minutes, he could have set up a five-block perimeter -- Hundreds of trench-coated g-men.
it was worth it. We now know two things.
we got to move off bonds, and his name is Peter Burke.
know thy enemy, right? - Fine.
now you've got the money to pay for the invitation.
what name you gonna use? - I don't know.
nicholas halden. - Quaint.
get yourself a few aliases. You're gonna need them.
Oh, pop quiz, hot shot -- Adler's market strategy pre-crash?
short derivatives, bullish on commodities.
you have learned much, grasshopper.
why are you filling that bottle with bargain red?
have you studied Adler's wine list?
is that the '91 bordeaux?
the one year it was corked in the wrong bottle.
$800 a pop.
I, of course, got this bottle empty.
best served when the guests are drunk.
and I asked my cleaner to keep an eye out for something in your size.
Yeah, I don't know if I'm a suit guy.
you'll be fine.
well, I really appreciate you coming. - Thanks.
Mr. Adler? Nick halden. Nice to meet you.
I brought this from my collection.
that's very generous. Thanks for coming.
Hey, nice play on the emerging markets last quarter.
you really called russia.
well, it all came down to grains, didn't it?
where do you think they're going?
bull market. For us, not europe.
I'd say their imports are up 20%.
interesting. Enjoy the party.
Raphael'ssaint george and the dragon
it's a powerful piece. - Commodities and art?
you've got diverse interests.
like you, art is my passion.
then you should talk to my assistant.
Nick halden.
Hi. I'm Kate moreau. - Hi.
you like it? - What? What? Yeah.
no, it's,-- It's breathtaking.
it's my favorite one.
Raphael was a master of balance
thick brush strokes for the landscape, but the skin tones are almost...translucent.
are you an artist? - I dabble.
I tried, but the romance of being a starving artist wore off very fast.
well, you won't find any original Nick haldens at a gallery downtown.
what do you do?
I'm looking for new opportunities.
excuse me, sir. May I take that?
thank you.
you're here to cozy up to my boss.
if I work for Adler, I can go anywhere.
any advice?
I've seen the seating chart, and you're nowhere near him.
that's your first challenge.
Hi.
I like a challenge.
good luck, Nick. - Thanks.
it seems my date has been relegated to the buenos aires table.
you have until the salad course arrives to tell me what you want. Go.
I want to work for you.
in what capacity, other than your enthusiasm for grains and paint?
acquisitions. My team is full.
cameron Singer -- You're about to buy his firm.
Speculation's been front page of thejournalall week.
pass the bread.
well, he's been avoiding that woman.
next week, Hannah fields will announce her new investment branch. She's buying out Singer.
he's gonna back out of your deal, and the media will eat it up.
your company will appear unstable.
that could spook investors.
I'm gonna continue my meal now with someone who looks better in an cocktail dress than you.
well, look into Singer.
if it turns out I'm right, call me.
the Singer deal -- Was it true? - Absolutely.
Mozzie and I had been spying on them for weeks.
Adler ditched Singer and brought me in a month later.
he hired you to find things for him to buy.
well, part of my job was knowing everything about everyone Adler dealt with.
he had a lot of holdings and a lot of enemies.
turns out I had a knack for rooting them out.
and Kate was there the whole time.
is that when you guys got together?
no, no. She had a boyfriend.
it's not there.
all right, we'll just have to try again.
remind me again why I let you make my favorite necklace disappear.
Because...you like magic.
someday you're going to tell me all of your secrets.
I mean it.
may I?
maybe someday.
come out with me on friday.
I,-- I have your assignment from Adler.
he wants you to look into this.
right.
looks like someone's been looking into his recent art acquisitions.
michael asked me to move to chicago with him.
Chicago?
are you gonna go? - I-I am, in a month.
it's a big step. - Yeah. I know.
well, you'll like chicago.
They,-- They have a great art museum, and decent pizza.
little windy. - Yeah, I've heard that.
I should just get this - I need to get back to work.
what is this?
it's a fractal -- A mathematical curiosity.
that was the first time you'd seen one? - Yeah.
you know, he was obsessed with them.
his were similar to that one, but none was an exact match.
okay, so, Kate was going to chicago with another guy, and you were trying to root out whoever was looking into Adler's stuff.
keep talking.
you found the culprit. - She talked her way in.
she seems mostly interested in your south american acquisitions.
and you got her to come here in person?
I had the foundation feed her a story that they were impressed with her research.
she thinks she's here for a job interview.
bring her in. - Yes, sir.
miss hunter.
it's a pleasure to meet you. - Have a seat.
miss hunter...
your passion for antiquities is unusual for such a young woman.
well, every object has a story to tell.
I find those stories fascinating.
that was almost convincing.
who are you working for?
I don't work for anyone...yet.
that's why I'm here. - You can drop the act.
someone is paying you to get into my records.
now, who is that? Why don't you tell me?
sir, maybe it would be best if we
what are you looking for?
there were rumors you made some big discoveries.
I got curious.
I thought you wanted to share your art with the world.
that's for me to decide.
you accessed my private database.
you made copies of my records.
I should bring charges.
everybody gets one big mistake in life and one opportunity to fix it.
I believe in second chances, Miss hunter.
I think you're clever enough to know what I mean.
Thanks, Nick.
grateful to be here, Mr. Adler.
Vincent.
your hard work deserves a reward.
thank you.
I know I don't meet the buy in, but
Nick, come on, now. We've talked about this.
you know I don't like my people to invest in the fund.
you've made exceptions.
for you.
thank you, sir.
you invested your money with him. - All of it.
we all did. He was making us 14%.
you didn't know it was a scam?
no. My goal at the time was to prove my loyalty to Adler.
the job became my life.
then what happened to Alex?
I know there's more to that story.
you're sweet.
nice trick.
you got me.
you got off easy.
too late to apologize. - I'm not gonna apologize.
it's my job to catch you.
it's your job to not get caught.
fair enough.
what do you want?
buy me a drink, and we'll talk.
let's go.
Nick Halden -- That's a good name.
not your real one, but I like it.
I recognize a fellow grifter when I see one, Nick.
all right.
humor me, Alex.
what were you really looking for?
something Adler doesn't have.
he has everything.
he doesn't have this.
it's a music box.
quite the holy grail.
it's worth about as much.
so Alex turned you on to the music box.
Yeah, she'd been chasing it for years.
she heard Adler had information on it.
did he? - He had a rumor that it was at the amalienborg palace in copenhagen.
said she'd send me a message if she ever need my help getting it.
what kind of message?
a flower.
did she ever send it?
Yeah, but that's another part of the story.
Alex disappeared, and Kate Well, things changed.
you're taking a sick day?
I'm not allowed to feel lousy?
every day with Adler counts.
I've already got the siphon in place. All we need is the password.
I'll get the password.
you know, I'm sensing your heart isn't totally into this.
my heart is fine.
this is about the girl.
I thought she left for chicago.
she left today.
you know, it's probably for the best.
now you can focus.
I got to go, okay?
you're supposed to be in chicago.
it's a big step... In the wrong direction.
Why?
because you're here.
so, you and Adler developed a connection, and you and Kate were finally together.
you had it all.
Yeah, I was eating the best food, wearing the best suits, drinking the best wine -- The kind that has corks.
it was the perfect life.
and it was also the perfect lie.
you and Mozzie were still working the long con.
trying to make the lie real.
but every con has an expiration date.
Adler makes the transfer on friday, and you still haven't gotten the password yet.
I said I'll get it, i'll get it.
Oh, good, because I thought you were having second thoughts about abandoning your new town-and-country lifestyle.
don't kid yourself.
Kate doesn't even know your real name.
none of them do.
they care about me, okay?
she cares about me.
um, no.
she cares about Nick halden, and he doesn't exist.
I hear the suit's been asking around about you.
he has a sketch.
Where'd he get a sketch?
Oh, they always have a sketch or a print or something.
look, it's time to finish this job and move on.
let's have a look at you.
never worn a custom suit before.
the fit is perfect... Except for the cuff.
the break should be an eighth of an inch above the shoe.
Nelson. - Good eye, sir.
I can't accept. This is a $10, 000 suit.
you can and you will.
some people say dress for the job you want.
I say dress as the man you want to be.
Nick, men like you and I --We have an obligation to assault the commonplace every chance we get, from the clothes we wear to the art we collect to the women in our lives.
you and Kate have gotten close.
Yeah.
you look good together.
how does she feel about it?
there are things about me that I haven't told her.
I wouldn't worry.
oftentimes, the things we try and hide are the most obvious to the people around us.
everything all right?
Nelson, would you excuse us for a moment?
of course. - Thanks.
there's something you should know.
what's wrong?
I flagged a small irregularity in your account in the caymans.
Trace-analysis reports were inconclusive.
what kind of irregularity?
blips from a random i. p.Address.
hacker?
it's probably someone from the bank, confirming.
but I'd have to look into the account details to be sure.
you'd need the password.
I'll arrange a time for us to go to the bank so you can access it yourself.
no, no.
I trust you.
bank closes at 6: 00. Burn this when you're done.
don't sell yourself short.
Kate'll love you for who you really are... As will others.
you like the hat?
I could get used to it.
are you all dressed up with somewhere else to go?
no, I just have to be somewhere by 6: 00.
it's a commitment I made a long time ago.
I think that you should blow off said commitment.
yeah? - Look.
our violinist agrees.
you are staying here with me.
I promised a friend.
I can't I can't back out of it.
Kate, I'm... - What's wrong, Nick?
I just feel like You and me and all this I don't know.
I feel like I could blink, and it'd all be gone.
you just blinked.
I'm still here.
then nothing else matters.
you didn't get the password.
you said it yourself. This is a long con.
you stepped on the brakes when you should have leaned in.
it's Kate, isn't it?
I'm in love with her.
every con man gets his heart broken once.
she's not gonna break my heart.
Well...We'll get them next time.
love is a temporary madness.
it erupts like an earthquake and then subsides.
St. Augustine.
good.
you've been reading.
a smart guy told me to.
Oh, my god.
I want more.
what? You're insatiable.
pizza. - What?
we have half a margherita left over from last night.
wait, hold on. Whoa Who said you get the sheet? No, no, no, no, no.
Yes, I get it. - All right.
mine.
Nick. - What?
the neighbors can see you.
Oh. Hi, neighbors. Should I give them a little show?
no. Here. Look. There. - Ooh, I got a hat, too.
now you're presentable. - All right.
you like that?
put some pants on.
floors of wall street.
you got the sheet. You don't get the last slice.
it's only fair.
Vincent Adler has disappeared, and with him hundreds of millions of dollars of his clients' money.
a preliminary investigation indicates his investment firm may have been built on a giant house of cards.
securities regulators now claim Adler never traded any shares for client accounts.
if true, Adler's disappearance could prove to be the brilliant exit strategy - for one of the greatest financial frauds of our time. - Holy cow.
can you believe it?
who'd have figured?
nobody saw this coming?
this guy took thousands of people for their life savings, including charities.
clinton jones.
word around here is that you're putting together a special white-collar task force.
I am.
well, I've only been here a few months.
but I was wondering, if there were some spots open, if I could get a shot.
are you the one who put the dutchman on our radar?
Yes, sir.
I studied a profile like his at quantico.
well, I can't promise anything.
it is a long list, agents with more seniority -- You know how it is.
that's not the same sucker you got from james bonds last year, is it?
people talk.
Yeah. Well, nobody gets why i'm still holding on to this.
unfinished business.
I get it.
so, Adler disappeared, but what about his account?
there was only a dollar left in it.
the password was an anagram for "nice try neal."
then what happened with Kate?
no money, no jobs. It's all gone.
I know. I know. Hey, hey.
we're gonna be okay.
it's just you and me now, right?
that's all that matters.
come here.
we're gonna get it all back, okay?
okay.
how?
okay, if we're gonna do this, I need to tell you something about me.
what?
I'm not Nick halden.
my name's neal caffrey.
you and Kate lost everything?
Yeah. Adler paid well.
we put it right back into the company.
and why not?
everything he touched turned to gold.
he conned us. - He conned everybody... And then disappeared.
what happened after you told Kate the truth?
I thought this was about Adler.
well, I just got a few beers left, and I'm curious.
I taught her to survive.
Hey, you, stop!
someone stop that guy!
Freeze!
put your hands up!
Hey. Get up.
officer, this man stole my package.
I did no such thing.
whoa, whoa, be careful with that.
it's the falconer manuscript from the 16th century.
Hey, I recognize this guy.
how you doing, smedley?
this guy's got warrants out in three different states.
thanks to you, we can get him off the streets.
write him a receipt.
you can't take that.
it's worth a fortune.
we'll look after you, okay?
bring this to the 23rd precinct.
pick it up from evidence in a few days.
days? - 23rd.
I'm a little sick of being scalped every time we pull one of these.
you know, moz, you look better without the hairpiece.
very handsome.
Hale takes a cut.
we split the rest three ways. I don't know. It's not bad.
to all this.
to the best of times.
and to... Our villa on the cte d'azur, the sun setting over the mediterranean.
the olive trees whispering in the hills.
let's do it.
let's go.
now?
you want to go to france now? - Yeah.
look, that fbi agent -- Burke.
he's been asking around about the british pounds.
maybe -- I don't know.
maybe we should take some time away, outside the fbi's range.
we can start in cap d'antibes while it's still warm, work our way up to paris, over to amsterdam, then copenhagen.
I'm not going to copenhagen.
okay, I should've mentioned Alex.
this isn't about Alex, neal.
you can't just say, "hey, Kate, let's go to copenhagen for this opportunity" Alex told me about.
you just tried to con me.
I made a mistake, okay?
I'm doing this for us.
that music box is worth a fortune. It can give us the life we want.
you went to copenhagen without her. - Yeah.
the box was there.
but it was a three-person job. Without Kate, it fell apart.
Alex ended up in a french hospital, and I barely escaped.
but someone at the palace pointed the finger at you.
everyone thought you had the box.
I didn't correct them.
sure. It gave you great street cred.
I came back to new york.
Kate was gone.
well, she learned something from me,'cause she disappeared.
I started running big cons.
guess I was trying to get her attention.
well, you certainly got ours, steve tabernackle.
you knew about steve?
we knew a lot of things.
before returning to new york, caffrey popped up in denmark and france.
he's not afraid to cross borders.
he definitely does his homework.
we flagged his aliases at all ports of entry.
I mean, when we get a hit, we throw up roadblocks.
no, he'll never use the same i. d.Twice.
tell me something I haven't heard.
what about you? Agent...
you're on the run. How do I catch you?
stake out my girlfriend?
well, caffrey has one, right?
we think they split up.
well, but we know where she is.
does she know we're onto her? - No.
we've never had enough on her to bring her in.
and he hasn't gone anywhere near her.
hang on.
it took us months to catch her, and she never stays in the same place for more than a week.
she's hiding from him.
he doesn't know where she is.
Hey, ruby's in burma.
I'm gonna need a bush plane to get Oh, no. Did your pigeon die?
no, Estelle's fine -- Best homer in the city.
then what?
I received some news.
Some...information has surfaced on the street. - Kate?
you have to understand.
it comes from a highly unreliable source. - Where is she?
his name is Jimmy the snitch. - I need a location.
Neal, this smells like a trap. - I don't care. I need to see her.
it's a storage facility.
she'll be there this afternoon.
all right. Thanks.
be careful.
forging raphael.
you've gotten good.
I heard the real painting was stolen.
I hoped it would get your attention.
it did.
I missed you.
I lied to you about a lot of things, Kate, but I never lied about loving you.
I believe you.
I love you, too.
how did you find me?
well, moz heard you were fencing mauritian penny stamps.
I quit dealing in stamps.
it's okay.
hands on your head!
agent Burke.
you're under arrest.
I know.
thank you.
I never would have found her without you.
it's my pleasure.
so you guys were all in that municipal - van out front?
that's got to be uncomfortable.
doesn't smell too good, either.
and you know the rest.
all right, so what do we do next?
we find Adler. He's the key to this whole damn thing.
well, I've looked. His trail didn't go cold, Peter. Thereisno trail.
I caught you when I found out what you wanted most.
we know what he wants most.
the fractal.
what is this?
you have any ideas?
it must mean something, must point somewhere.
are you telling me the truth, neal?
why do you ask?
I only know one of your friends who's into origami.
Alex has been here.
and this receipt is from today.
what does she think it is?
it's a fractal antenna.
they're in everything now. There's one in your cellphone.
and this shape corresponds to a specific frequency for an emergency beacon.
emergency beacon?
you're telling me that if we build a real one of these and we hook that up to a radio
it's gonna lead us to a boat or a plane or something that disappeared in the 1940s.
how goes the construction of our treasure map?
the antenna? Slow and steady.
I'm trying to build everything as close to the original 1940s designs as possible.
do you know how hard it is to find vacuum tubes these days?
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
good work, moz.
I don't like that expression.
good work? - Well,"work" implies I have a job.
apologies. - A careless word may kindle strife.
see you later.
you must be Neal.
you know my name, but I don't know yours.
Ah, I see that you have met Ford.
Hi. It's a pleasure.
ford is an old friend, and he's just moved back to Manhattan.
I missed the old neighborhood, to say the least.
I think you'll find that you two have quite a bit in common.
is that so?
so you'll be around for a while?
june has been kind enough to make a few donations to my new apartment.
we both know how generous she is.
thank you.
that looks like one of Byron' s suits.
that reminds me I have some more jackets in the back room.
come.
How' d you know June's husband?
Byron and I worked together.
partners in crime?
something like that.
Hey. Is Peter around? - No.
I need a favor.
Neal, what did I say last time you asked me for a favor?
I should think long and hard before trying to pull anything over on you.
And? - And that if I ever did try, you'd break one or both of my arms.
you know I hate to repeat myself.
I'm willing to risk it. Can you run a print?
it's not for me. It's for June.
your landlady needs a print analysis?
a friend of hers dropped by the house.
I think he's up to something.
you catch a name? - Ford.
it's probably a nickname.
what did this "Ford" do?
he took some of June's things.
does she know?
actually, she gave them to him.
out of the kindness of her heart. - Yeah.
but he may be a criminal.
sound like anyone we know?
this is different.
afraid you'll lose that nice roof of yours?
there's something off about this guy.
will you run it for me? Please.
you know he doesn't like the vet.
I think he feels guilty.
Yeah.
he wouldn't have been there if he didn't swallow one of my handcuff keys.
honey, he's a dog. Dogs like shiny things.
you need to be more careful what you leave around!
Oh, so I should feel guilty?
I think an apology is in order.
I'm sorry.
good boy. - Thank you.
all right. Come on. We have some time.
you want to have lunch?
I'd love to. - But what?
I'll take a rain check.
this is Burke.
Caffrey asked me to run a print.
he knows better.
Peter, you should see this. - All right.
everything okay?
it was until you told Diana to red-flag a murder suspect.
murder suspect? - Jonas Ganz
person of interest in the Sturdivant heist a few years back. Charged with armed robbery and homicide.
the only thing the prosecution could stick was GTA for the getaway vehicle.
june knows him? - Yeah. She said he was a friend.
Yeah, well, this "friend" has been in and out of correctional facilities for the last decade or so.
he had a lifer quality about him.
his first stint was for burglary in Lompoc, back in 2000.
can I see that? - Yeah.
I think Diana pulled the wrong print.
there was only one print on the coin, and she ran it.
Why? - cause this isn't the guy I met.
lab pulled seven points of reference from the print on that coin.
it belongs to Ganz.
this can't be identity theft.
no, I don't think anybody would want to pass himself off as this guy.
Peter. I dug up the intel you requested on Ganz.
I may have found our connection to the guy you met at June's.
that's him. looks like Ganz has a former cell mate.
Bradford Tullman, aka "ford."
locked up for real-estate fraud two years ago.
sold nonexistent land to a half a dozen major corporations.
another smooth talker.
if he shared a cell with Ganz, that could explain the print.
Yeah, but not why Ford doesn't have one.
I saw him touch the coin.
super glue on the fingertips? Invisible tape?
no, I shook his hand. I would've noticed.
Oh, look at this. Says here...He's a known associate of June's late husband.
they were booked 20 years ago.
for running a rooftop casino?
out of your place. Look at that.
always did feel like home.
all right, Jones, get ahold of Ganz's probation officer, find out where he's staying.
have Diana sit on him. - On it.
if Ganz and Ford are working our backyard, - I want to know about it. - All right.
Ganz... You've got a lot of friends.
Hey, June.
I knew you wouldn't mind. I was looking for this.
photo album?
ford asked if he could see it.
well... You two go way back.
back then, the three of us were inseparable.
Lenox lounge. - Yes.
Byron looked so handsome in that suit.
even Ford asked if I still have it.
but I told him it probably wouldn't fit him.
it really is something. - Yeah.
I think I'll take it down, let him see it. - Yeah.
let me know if you need anything, okay? - I promise.
Hey.
you mind if I come in?
sure. Come on in.
Oh, thank you.
it looks different now.
well, you know, Neal, the reason why I came is because I want to set the record straight.
you know how it is.
you tell people that you've done time, and they have a bad way of looking at you.
june told me a little, but given your current situation, I was hoping that you'd understand.
maybe I do.
Yeah, me and Byron.
this was our place.
we had three games of five-card stud going around the clock.
good rake? - We made a lot of green, especially since the joint was nicely juiced.
what, did you have a mechanic?
kid, I was the mechanic.
running up cards in your own joint. That's risky.
Hello, Hello. - hey.
you boys talking shop?
Oh, we were just talking about the good old days.
old days. Have you asked him?
Oh, yeah, I was just about to.
june and I would love for you to join us for dinner tonight.
of course. - Oh, that's wonderful.
then I'll see you downstairs.
okay. - Okay.
she's not like the rest, is she?
she sees us for who we really are.
is that why you're here?
well, I'm here because...I'm looking for a second chance.
good.
I was worried you were looking for something else.
I never found it cause I haven't worn this suit before.
I don't like this guy.
you've never met this guy.
he's trying to scam June!
look, I'm with you, but all we can assume is he's been in touch with a former cell mate. Who's a potential killer.
that's not very comforting, mon frere.
you think this is what Ford's after?
maybe Ford's trying to finish something he and Byron started.
I can try and make it more legible.
Hey, you mind hanging around the house the next few days?
Oh, I'll make sure she's okay.
Oh, we've got book club on for tomorrow anyway.
I didn't know you two had a book club.
it's very exclusive. - Well, so is this.
Peter, what's up?
looks like Ganz is pulling together a crew.
what kind of crew? - Not for rowing.
looks like muscle for hire.
he's planning another heist.
Yeah, I want to talk to Ford.
bring him in the office tomorrow.
no, he's smart, peter. You won't be able to sweat it out of him.
you got a better idea?
how do you feel about dinner parties?
I hope that's a non sequitur.
I'm having dinner with Ford and June tonight.
you and Elizabeth should join us.
you want me to bring my wife to a covert interrogation?
it's perfect. He won't suspect you're a Fed.
then who am I? - A co-worker.
and what kind of co-work would that be?
I may have implied that you're not exactly a noble citizen.
no. - Peter...
I said no. Find another way.
Hello? Hey, Neal.
Really? That sounds great!
I'm sure Peter would love to come.
okay.
perfect. We'll see you tonight.
Neal just invited us to dinner.
Yeah. He's using you so I can interrogate a suspect.
well, what's wrong with mixing a little business with pleasure?
Plus, you owe me dinner.
lunch. That was a rain check for lunch.
and you're paying me with dinner.
this is gonna be fun!
dress nice, okay? - Okay.
burkes!
Peter. You baked.
pie. - Bon Appetite.
Peter, Elizabeth, I'm so happy you could make it.
it's our pleasure. -Ome.
you must be Ford.
Peter. You're certainly not what I expected.
same here.
Neal tells me that you pull team gags together.
we do.
he's a hell of an outside patsy. -Yeah.
he's got that look.
patsy. - It's a compliment.
no way.
so damn long!
you never mentioned June had such a wonderful voice, and you, by the way.
please.
you should see how she moves!
please. Ford promised me a dance a long, long time ago.
come on.
well, if you need some company, let us know.
"us"? Peter, you dance?
no. He's terrific. We took a Salsa Class last year, smiled the whole entire time.
do you have any pictures of that?
cause I'd love to show the guys at the office.
no pictures. Thanks, honey.
thank you. I'm gonna freshen this up.
Oh, my goodness. That's amazing.
that was nice. - Thanks.
but I'm losing patience.
ganz is out there, planning God knows what.
we'll find the link.
well, we better find it before I have to sing something from "pippin."
I'll be right back.
no, no. Hang in there. Stay...
Peter? Any requests?
Moz, you got something?
asked around about Ford. Word on the street is, he masterminded the Nicosia job back in the day.
his credentials are impressive, to say the least.
how come I hadn't heard of him?
well, because the guy's a whisper.
you know how it is.
in our business, no reputation is the best reputation.
you find anything on that receipt I gave you?
I have, with the use of a hair dryer and photo shop contrast.
why do you have a hair dryer?
you want to know what it says or not?
I'm listening. I'm listening.
it's a receipt from a furniture store for a walnut leather coffee table.
Yeah, I've seen it, in Byron' s study.
there's something else.
there's an additional charge for labor and modification.
you're saying Byron had it custom-made?
it looks that way.
are you having a party over there? Without me?
Oh, let me put that away for you.
is that a photo album?
wow, honey, did you see that?
I love photos. They tell you so much about a person.
it'd be nice if I could see some photographs of yourself - Yes... - And Byron... and Ford.
Byron... What were you up to?
hello. You know what?
I was looking for Byron' s record collection.
Oh, it's in the library.
the end of the hall, past the stairwell.
okay. Thanks. Sure.
Oh, look at that.
that was Byron' s first new car - A '64 Corvair convertible.
where have you been?
I was almost put on background vocals.
come with me. Right now.
the plate was right here. - Plate?
printing plate for the u.s.$100 bill.
you're sure?
fair enough.
where is he? - He's gone.
he just caught a cab outside.
Where's Ford heading? - I don't know.
nor do I. You're late, Moz!
it's a travesty, really. Had I been at the dinner, it would have been a fascinating meeting of the minds.
I didn't know you were invited.
I wasn't, but I thought there' d be hors doeuvres.
there's pie.
did you bring ice cream from your truck?
how did Ford know about the plate?
well, he's probably known for years.
I'm curious. The plate in question?
Flexographic, for the $100 from 1991.
smart. - Yeah. Unlike newer bank notes, they'd have fewer security features.
no watermarking of Franklin, no micro-printing.
no optically variable ink, much easier to duplicate, and it's still legal currency.
what's old becomes new again.
all right. Since we can't find Ford, let's figure out what else he needs to make these bills.
I'll need to borrow some reading materials.
fine. From where? - The U.S.Treasury.
I'm not comfortable with this.
Really? You're not comfortable?
I've got the "Men In Black" bobsled team breathing down my neck.
these treasury agents are a little skeptical.
you look like a 12-year-old who just found the lingerie section of the sears catalogue.
okay. The plate is the real deal, but it's just a start.
you need the right press, the right cutter, but most importantly, the right inks and paper.
can you forge these?
U.S.Bills are tricky.
the ink, maybe, but the paper -- I mean, the feel of that linen-cotton blend is tough to duplicate...
so I've been told.
all right. We're done here.
so, could someone steal these things?
you think that's why Ganz pulled his crew together?
makes the most sense.
Hey. We were sitting on Ganz's place.
guess who showed up.
we grabbed him as he left. No one saw.
put him in the conference room.
you two really do work together.
never lied about that.
tell me about your relationship with Ganz.
I told him about the plate while we were at rikers.
you traded information with Ganz for protection.
where' d you get the plate?
Byron. He stole it.
from where? - From me.
I thought he would want in.
it would have been a big one for us.
our, final score.
but he wanted to print the money himself?
he didn't want to print it at all.
he was protecting me from myself.
so, coming back into June's life, everything you said to her -- It's all a lie?
no.
if Ganz had found that plate in her house...
I came back to protect her.
right. Ganz has the plate.
what's his next move?
I told him what else he needed.
paper, ink... - Cutter, press.
the list was long.
from one professional to another, how come you don't have any prints?
pumice stone.
I rub my fingers with it every morning.
wake up, brush your teeth, scrape incriminating evidence off your fingertips?
old habits...
Yeah.
think he's telling the truth?
maybe.
ford wears a hat.
and...?
I'm not him, Peter.
I didn't say anything. Just commenting on the hat.
you think he wanted to protect June?
you don't.
no, I think he's looking for that last big score.
people can change, Peter.
maybe.
look. The fastest way to shut this down is to get Ganz and his crew confessing to a premeditated crime on tape.
you want to send Ford undercover?
it's a big risk. - Not just Ford.
me. - Yeah.
look. Ganz has two wheel man, two pieces of muscle, and a forger.
we'll need to take one of them out of the equation.
can I make a suggestion?
we took Ganz's forger out of play.
he had a nice little side hobby going forged autographed Yankee baseballs.
ready to introduce Neal as your pinch-hitter?
nice.
you like what I did there? - I did. That was good.
I'm ready, fellas.
this is a one-way radio, with GPS.
you don't use wires anymore?
not since "Carlito's Way."
FBI's gotten pretty slick.
you sure you're up for this?
son, I once walked out of the Met holding a Renoir.
that was you? - That was me.
this ain't nothin'.
is that the guy?
who else would it be?
this kid is the best print man around.
does this kid have a name?
no names.
the less we know about each other, the better.
how long have you guys known each other?
about five years?
mutual friend of ours need to get out of town, so he came to my shop.
he hooked me up with some of the best work I've ever seen.
photo I.D. passports. - So we stayed in touch.
used him four times since.
five. Don't forget that other thing.
well, that was between us.
let's see what he knows.
it's like they're speaking "crimines."
give me the I.D.s.
which one's the fake?
watch this.
they're all fake.
the hologram on the Alabama license is cemented with the wrong base.
and the UV ink should be mixed at a 5-to-1 ratio.
this looks like 3-to-1.
the laminate on the California is too thick, and last time I checked, "Illinois" is spelled with two "l," not one.
all right!
I'll need to know the required tools.
we have the equipment all ready, and we have the list.
I'll contact you this week.
I gave you the list, but now I'm bringing you help -- Good help
someone who's not gonna get busted for a phony baseball.
how did you know it was a baseball?
gear up now!
I never said how the guy was busted.
suddenly I think you know a little too much.
look, let's not get jumpy.
you want an explanation, I'll give you one.
you say the word, we're in there.
I'm all ears. - You think someone talked?
maybe. I don't know you.
and Ford has a tendency to get chatty.
put it past him. Why should I?
cause I called the Feds.
you? - Yeah.
I let word slip about a few indecent ebay transactions.
there better be a good reason.
ford told me you were pulling something big and that you'd need a reliable bill maker.
and I wasn't about to risk my share on some half-wit hire.
you knew about this? - Of course.
you're in.
you... You wait on the sidelines.
it's on him to hand over your share now.
you trust the kid?
hell, no.
but what choice do I have?
I'm gonna hold on to this for a while.
if Ganz had seen this, you probably wouldn't be breathing right now.
I'm on call?
ganz contacts you, I want you ready, willing, and able.
now, he said he already had the tools.
what else does he need?
I saw Ford's checklist. It's either ink, paper, or both.
Yeah. You and Ford had a pretty interesting rapport today.
I know where you're going.
don't need to look in a crystal ball? - You think he's a cautionary tale.
you want to be like him when you grow up?
more fun than sitting in a cubicle.
Neal, if ever you do decide to grow up, you should realize this one thing. You can either be a con or a man.
you can't be both.
run accounts on everyone in Ganz's crew. They're pretty dried up.
probably paying for supplies in cash.
it'd be good if you could remember the aliases you saw on those I.D.s.
joseph Dowd, Kenny Estrada, and Dylan Fleecs.
you didn't ask. - Well, it's simple word association.
Kenny Estrada -- He won't say nada. - Are you serious?
Yeah, I got one for every cop and crook I ever met.
what was mine? Burke the jerk?
Oh, come on. You tell me what else rhymes with Burke.
"work." "lurk." "smirk." "clerk" works.
what do you have? - Wait a second.
this is the original booking slip for our forger?
we printed him this morning.
there are two colors of ink here.
he had dark green ink on his fingers before we brought him in.
our forger already mixed the dye.
ganz is going for the paper. - Yeah.
Hey. - Oh, hey.
so, I ran those aliases. - Yeah, who showed up?
what? - Nothing.
what' d you find?
he's been staying at the continental in Long Island city.
paid for his room with cash, but we got a pay-per-view charge off the card he laid down for deposit.
the continental's right next to the BCU plant.
it supplies the bureau of printing and engraving with paper stock.
that's where Ganz plans to get his paper.
get ahold of Serrano in the Treasury Department and Kavanagh in secret service.
if they try to hit the BCU, we'll be waiting.
all right.
should... - that means we move, Caffrey.
how was the book club?
well, there's only so much to discuss when it comes to Kitty Kelley.
how's it going with Ford? - Well, he's working with us.
Oh, shame.
he was a true legend.
Byron had it better.
Oh, he wound up with the plate.
more than that, Moz.
June? - Yeah. And a home.
you think Byron wanted out of the life?
I think he did.
that's why he hid the plate instead of using it.
well, if he really wanted out, he could have destroyed the plate.
I don't know. Temptation of that last big score is strong.
ford can't resist it. - No.
few of us can.
Peter. - Yeah.
ganz just shook his surveillance.
I know. Ganz is off the grid. - So is Ford.
apparently, Neal's not the only one who can slip the marshals.
all right, I'm gonna call the Treasury Department.
I want you to get ahold of the secret service.
this is burke. You need to get your people in place.
this thing could go down any second.
relax, Burke. The stock is safe. We're moving in now.
paper's in transit?
why wasn't I told about this?
I want a team to Caffrey's place now!
I gotta tell you, the guy's still got it.
let's make some money.
Neal, it's me.
you're too late.
we're going to be hitting the truck en route.
we need you to I.D. The archived paper.
you think you can handle it?
this isn't what I do.
it is today.
Ganz: go, go, go!
get out of the truck now!
you recognize her? That's your daughter.
I'll be sure to take good care of her once you're gone.
get out!
out of the truck now!
open it up!
we got cops!
it's showtime, kiddo.
get on the ground. Face down!
come on, come on. What's taking so long?
get back there and help him.
move it! Move it! here.
this is it.
talk to me.
NYPD says the truck was hit two minutes ago.
five-man team, and they got away clean.
there's a good chance Caffrey was with them.
what about Ford?
there was no one matching his description.
he's up to something. There's no reason he should run from us.
I got an APB out.
good. We need to find him, fast.
it's good to see you, kid.
any problems?
it went down like you said. - They bringing in the paper?
Yeah.
one last score, huh, Ford?
he's smart, isn't he?
it's time for you two to get to work.
all right, now, you be careful where you're pointing that banger, kid.
you ran a nice game, old man, but it's my rig now.
so, can we print... Or what?
guess we don't have a choice, do we?
let's get started.
can you...? Thank you.
how much more are we printing?
all of it.
that could take days.
then it'll take days.
smile, guys. We got all the time in the world.
ford was clever. He let word about a potential job slip.
and let someone pull it for him.
you're like him. - I accept your accusation.
let's pretend you've broken some laws. Where would you go to hide?
someplace I've never been caught. If he's really pulling the strings, he's already got it set up, and he's got his tracks covered.
maybe not.
there's something about these photos...That Ford tried to hide from me.
there's something here. That's the Lenox lounge off 125th street.
june's mentioned it before.
what' d she say?
Byron used to run the back room.
when? - About 25 years ago.
that building's still there, isn't it?
you said this place was clean! It is.
then why are there police outside?
give me the case.
I said give it to me! - Okay, okay!
what was in Ganz's suitcase? - Just a lot of newspaper.
you called those cops.
I thought I saw a cat stuck in a tree.
you were running this from the moment we met.
you knew that coin had Ganz's print on it, told him where to find me.
you put June's life at risk. For what, Ford?
for a score? - I had a choice to make.
walk away with a little something or a whole lot of nothing.
what is this?
guess someone's really worried about that cat.
are you for real, sweetheart?
is that real enough for you, sweetheart?
he had that on him.
keep the front locked up. No one in or out.
come with me.
How' d they find us?
unlike you, I've got a partner I can trust.
you really think you can make it?
you said you had a choice to make.
I'm gonna give you another one.
until the suspect is secure and Caffrey's safe, nobody moves.
it's not too late, Ford.
you can still walk away from this if I back your story.
I'll give you two options -- One, get rid of that gun, become a cooperating witness... And take June dancing.
option two?
you take that case and run as long as you can.
I'm too old to walk down another midway, son.
tell June... I'm sorry.
stand down. Come on.
Ford?
he want that way, but this place was a speakeasy. There are exits everywhere.
suspect is exiting the southeast corner of the building.
he won't get far.
ganz is out front.
jones and Diana are picking up the rest of his crew.
tried to help him.
you know there's one thing Byron figured out that Ford never did.
there's no such thing as a final score...only the next one.
unless you figure that out, you're gonna lose in the end.
you ready? - Yeah.
it's okay.
I've always known what kind of man he was.
then why let him in?
to remember...What Byron and I had.
even if it was just for a while.
maybe I wanted to go dancing again.
may I?
I found a junk guy in Queens who collects vintage radios.
it's a gold mine for parts.
I should have a working prototype -- Neal, are you listening?
do you ever think about how all this is gonna end?
Oh, you mean... The big score or the big house? - Yeah.
is there another option?
Byron found it.
Ah, the true-love route.
you know, that's the biggest con of them all.
you're a cynic. - Of course.
you know what they say.
old con men never die.
our smiles just fade away.
so you got rid of the printing plate?
it may have found its way back inside the table.
for a rainy day? - Yeah.
for a rainy day?
Matthew Keller pled down to manslaughter after you two brought him in for murder.
Yeah.
his sentencing was this week.
Yeah, he got 20 years at Barksdale.
yesterday, he contacted the Department of Justice.
he says he has information critical to national security.
his sentencing didn't go well. Now he wants a deal.
probably.
but we do that sometimes, Caffrey.
we make deals with con men.
what did Homeland Security say?
Keller wouldn't talk to them.
he insisted he would only talk to you.
Neal's right.
I seriously doubt he has any real information.
there's no harm checking it out.
go talk to him.
who is this guy?
he's an old rival of Neal's.
they were baccarat partners in Morocco.
uh, backgammon in Monaco.
close.
and we were never partners.
mm, a contemporary of Neal's... This I got to see.
no, he's not what you'd expect.
a little more Ratso Rizzo than Cary Grant.
I'm Cary Grant?
only by comparison to Ratso Rizzo.
agent Burke and Mr. Neal Caffrey.
thanks for coming, gents. I appreciate it.
thank you, O'Donnell.
you're doing all right for yourself, Keller.
eh, meager touches, but I get by.
Dominican rolled.
the, uh, tobacco is infused with Louis XIII cognac.
they're delicious. Please.
you have information for us?
I understand. You're on the job.
how about you, Neal, huh?
is this business or pleasure?
it's always a pleasure seeing you behind bars.
well, we're all in prison of sorts, aren't we?
it's the life we make out of it that matters.
I mean, you've made the most out of your prison sentence, working for the feds.
I think I'd like to do the same.
what do you want, Keller?
new game, Caffrey?
there it is.
I feel like I've made a home for myself here, you know?
I've nested.
and now they want to move me somewhere less welcoming.
Yeah. Barksdale Supermax.
don't think they chill the port there.
no, you're right.
Yeah, inmates don't realize that a white port should be lightly chilled.
you're a skilled people person.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
I don't know. A lot of Russian mob at Barksdale.
that's right. You have a problem with them.
a seven-figure debt, as I recall.
and there's another reason why I want to stay here...
which brings me to my proposal.
are you familiar with the term "pis aller"?
my French is a little rusty.
it's a move of last resort...
something you do when you're out of options.
Yeah.
now, if I had information of a maker of forged passports,
I imagine that would be of value.
what are you looking for in exchange?
I'd like to stay here.
no.
relax, Neal, all right?
it's not like I'm asking to be let loose on the streets of New York with only an anklet to control my compulsions.
and I am hoping, agent Burke, that this could lead to an ongoing relationship between you, me, and the Bureau.
you're already scheduled to be transferred, Keller.
we're pretty late in the process.
that's why I asked for you.
these are perfect passports. ... Caffrey quality...
just the thing for terrorists and... smugglers.
no promises, but if your information pans out,
I'll see what I can do.
I appreciate your candor.
I can see why Neal trusts you.
the guy's name is Jason Lang.
look him up.
okay, Neal.
time to go.
"pis aller..."
can also mean the worst thing that can happen.
we're both running out of options, Caffrey.
it's your move.
later, Satchmo.
Ohh.
el? Have you seen my jacket. ... The blue pinstripe?
Yeah, I've... I've got it. -Okay.
is it this one?
Yeah.
Ohh!
you have a meeting today.
I was supposed to pick up the dry cleaning last night.
I am so sorry.
honey, it's okay. I got it.
Ugh!
wait.
wait a minute. You never called to remind me.
did you assume I'd forget?
I know you had a lot on your mind.
Yeah, but I don't want to be the husband -that forgets to pick up the dry cleaning. -That's sweet.
but I am.
relax, okay? I'm not mad.
Yes, you are, and you're gonna hold onto it all day.
Really? Would I really do that?
no. Never.
okay, you're the one who forgot the dry cleaning.
see?
now you scared the dog.
Oh, add that to my list of imperfections.
okay, look, I don't want to be the wife that has to call and nag you to do things.
and plus, it's... it's a lot more effort to try and remind you, and I don't even know if you're gonna remember.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was such a foregone conclusion.
neither did I. Can we stop this?
Yes. Please.
okay, I've got to go to work.
me too.
have a wonderful day.
you too.
Yeah, that could have gone better.
you didn't help.
so, what do you think Keller wants?
well, he's set up like a king at Hawthorne Fed...
smoking Gurkhas, sipping port, reading the times.
as much as I loathe schadenfreude, it would be nice to know that Keller's suffering.
well, if they send him to Barksdale, the Russians will take care of that.
well, can you trust the suit to not keep him at Hawthorne?
his transfer's later today.
and you're heading to the office to check out what Keller told you?
he's desperate. This is his last play.
what about...Kate?
what about her?
well, Keller's used her to provoke you before.
he may do it again.
Keller can bring up Kate, he can offer Peter deals, he can even beat me at chess...
he's winning the chess game? No.
but my point... forged passports won't stop the transfer, and I've moved past Kate.
I have, Moz.
clearly.
look, she'll always be a part of me, but...
I have to move on.
okay.
Hey. What's going on?
Hey. I figured out Keller's game.
he wants us to investigate this Jason Lang, forger-turned-photographer on the Lower East Side.
so he said. Yeah, but here's where it gets good.
Keller and Lang were suspected of working together on the Bellmont bond forgeries three years ago.
they were partners?
Yeah, but it went south, and Keller took two bullets.
from Lang's gun.
I spoke to the case agent.
he said that their partnership dissolved and Lang destroyed the bonds.
Keller's going for a trifecta...
take out the man who shot him, secure his stay in a federal hotel room, and tweak me in the process.
next case.
Yeah, not so fast.
Hughes still wants us to find out if Lang is making phony passports.
Oh, don't tell me we have to make a deal with Keller.
Oh, relax, we're not gonna release Keller on an anklet...
unless June has a spare bedroom.
Oh, that's not funny. No, you're right.
you're nothing like Keller.'Cause he's a killer.
well, there's that, and he had cigars in his cell.
I remember your prison cell... no cigars.
when you're done, I'd like to go visit Lang's studio.
all right, I'm just saying, you know, he had a Tiffany lamp...So did my mom.
what's going on?
nothing.
Oh, come on.
your sarcasm goes up in direct proportion to your stress level.
it's Elizabeth.
I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning.
well, it happens.
apparently, all the time.
I've become the guy who forgets to do it so often that she had to pick it up without even asking me if I got it.
she was angry? -No.
and that's bad? -Yes.
I'm a constant disappointment.
she said that?
implied.
maybe she finds your forgetfulness endearing.
I don't want her to find my forgetfulness endearing.
and the worst part is, when she left this morning,
I didn't call her "hon."
have you ever seen an actual fight? Because...
it's our own little abbreviation for saying, "I love you."
when we first got married,
I used to say, "I love you, honey."
then it became, "love you, honey,
then "honey."
now all we need to say is, "hon."
very efficient.
point is, I didn't say it.
look, call her, leave her a voice mail, and say "hon" before you hang up.
did I miss anything?
no. I'll call her as soon as we're done here.
okay.
Hi. Peter Burke, FBI.
would you mind getting us Jason Lang?
thank you.
keep your chin down.
keep your eyes down.
we received information that your studio may be involved in the production of passport forgeries.
who told you that?
your record.
you were convicted of forgery in the past.
well, that was 10 years ago, you know?
just take a look at my price list.
I think you'll see that
I really have no use for an illegal side business.
Oh, come on. Take a break.
will you excuse me? -Certainly.
this is Jason.
I don't like this guy. What do you think?
Truesdale color-shifting printer.
mm, that'd be an important tool in making color-shifting images in the U. S. passport.
so would the Metrolux 5200, which is only used for one purpose.
making holographic images.
also found in U. S. passports.
it's a nice cover.
he integrates holograms into his artwork.
is this enough to bring him in?
it's enough for us to get a warrant.
Hey...Lang.
I need to talk to you about your equipment here.
Lang! Hey! La...
I'll follow. Stay here.
okay.
this was a setup.
drop your weapon and your cell and get in the van.
Hello?
you lost a key piece, Caffrey.
God damn it, Keller, this isn't a game!
of course it is. Life is a game.
if you stop playing, Peter Burke will die.
Hey, check the doors upstairs.
you're working with Keller.
what makes you say that?
Keller turned us on to you, so, obviously, you made a deal with him.
he's going to betray you.
well, why don't you let me deal with Keller, and... and you worry about yourself?
I'm not worried. -Hmm, you should be.
Nah, you should be.
you kidnapped a federal agent.
you're gonna have the full might of the U. S. Government closing around your neck.
time to shut up.
here's what I already know.
we made a left on Houston, then made a wide right about a minute later, driving straight for about eight minutes or so in stop-and-go traffic.
we're in the garment district, 8th or 9th Avenue and about 38th Street.
you're not wearing a mask, and I'm not dead, so you still need me for something.
before this goes any further, let's work something out.
you know, I've gone down that road before, and I trust you less than I trust Keller.
I don't know who you've dealt with in the past, but I keep my word.
you know, every few months, a different agent comes by, investigating a different crime, and he tells me that if I don't cooperate, he's gonna make my life a living hell.
and he does.
I can help you with that. How?
I mean, you can't stop the Bureau from playing politics.
it just never ends.
look, whatever you're planning,
Keller has something else in mind.
you are gonna wind up dead or in prison unless we work something out.
no more deals.
okay?
you should better protect your king.
Where's Peter?!
it's stuffy in here.
let's go for a walk.
I know you won't think twice about killing him, so I haven't told the FBI.
it's best not to discuss personal matters with everybody, Neal.
well, they're gonna find out soon enough.
you seem upset, Caffrey. You know?
I mean, clearly, you're dealing with a big problem here, and I wish I could help, but I got problems, too.
see, since Burke didn't stop my transfer, they're shipping me off to Barksdale later today.
now, my sources tell me that I, too, face dire circumstances unless my debts with the Russians gets paid.
how much do you owe them?
$2. 5 million.
once my problem goes away, then...
maybe then, I can help you with yours.
I don't have $2. 5 million.
Neal, how long have we known each other?
everything is gone, Keller.
I've had to use my resources since my current activities are a little limited.
it's true. You do have expensive tastes.
but I recall a night in Scotland when you acquired something worth that amount.
that was six years ago.
I'm fairly certain you held onto it.
I didn't. I didn't have any use for it.
well, I do.
so find it.
you got three hours till my transfer.
we'll be in touch.
you're gonna lose, Keller.
again.
pis aller.
my move of last resort, Neal.
Hey, Neal. If you're looking for Peter, he's not here.
Yeah, I know. Diana, we got a problem.
Keller and Lang worked out some kind of deal.
Peter's been taken.
listen up... one of our own's been kidnapped.
now, Graham, I want you to coordinate eastern and southern districts.
Jones, I want you with Keller's transfer convoy.
Campanelli, I want wiretaps within the next two hours on every cell, home, prison, and business linked to Keller and Lang.
under no circumstances does anyone talk to the press.
this is 24-7 till we find him.
all right, let's do it.
what did Keller tell you at the prison?
he wants $2. 5 million in exchange for Peter.
but Keller doesn't have Peter.
Keller's behind bars. He's running this.
he called me on Peter's cell right when Lang drove away with him.
ERT is analyzing the phone and we put out an APB on the van.
why does Keller want that kind of money?
he's doing 20 years.
he needs it to pay off the Russian mob so they don't kill him when he arrives at Barksdale.
the FBI doesn't negotiate... period...
particularly with someone who's already locked up and fearing for his life.
sir, all due respect... Keller doesn't bluff.
he will kill Peter if I don't engage him.
the reason no one takes our men is because we make it clear all hell will rain down on them if they do.
you also have to be willing to sacrifice a few of your agents to prove your point.
this isn't a one-man con, Neal.
this is the U. S. Government.
we will catch Lang, and we will string Keller up by his thumbs until he cries for forgiveness.
protocol dictates we lock Keller down till this is all over, but that gives him exactly what he wants...
to stay at Hawthorne indefinitely.
you've already contacted the prison?
we're sending his ass to Barksdale Supermax.
come sundown, Keller's gonna be bunking with a 7-foot Russian named Ivan.
Diana, you stay with Neal.
listen, Caffrey...
let us do our job. We'll bring Peter home safely.
would you give us a minute?
sure. - Thank you.
Moz, what's up?
I got a call from an unidentifiable voice from an unknown number.
gave me a time and a place for a meeting.
told me to tell you.
is this your little friend Keller?
all right, meet me at Madison Square Park in half an hour.
you got it.
Oh, and bring a hammer.
uh, ball-peen or claw?
ball-peen or claw?
surprise me.
Neal, what's going on?
Keller kidnapped Peter. Got to go.
w-wait, w-what?!
every agent in the Bureau has one goal right now...
to find your husband.
I know. Thank you, Reese.
we're going to post a team at your home in case he makes contact.
just, uh, give us a few minutes, -and I'll have them take you back. - Okay.
they, um...
they say this is the biggest manhunt the FBI has run in a decade.
even I've never seen anything like this.
what do you know about Keller?
he's a chess player.
he thinks 10, 12 moves ahead.
so everything they're doing...
all the helicopters and the agents knocking on doors?
he would have foreseen that.
they don't know his end game. - No.
what are you doing?
well, they want me to go home...
sit tight.
but is that what you're gonna do?
what do you want me to do?
whatever it takes to bring him home.
I'm supposed to be escorting you home.
I need to meet up with a friend first.
I hope you're not planning on making a side deal with Keller.
look, Diana, if this were any other kidnapper...
rule one... never let someone emotionally involved do the negotiating.
Yeah, if you're willing to lose your hostage.
I've read the FBI playbook. So has Keller.
well, why do you think he's so different?
early in his career, Keller pulled a 3-man job.
the game was pretty straightforward, and nobody got hurt.
but while they're walking away from the site, the third man says he thinks he left his passport behind.
while he's checking his pockets,
Keller put a bullet in his is head.
the guy's passport was in his back pocket the whole time.
Keller didn't wait to find out.
you were the second man?
if I can engage him, I can make sure Peter's alive and figure out a lead.
I can't endorse what you're doing.
what do you think Peter would let me do?
all right, I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.
I'll meet you here in... -one hour.
here. -Here.
Hey.
so, you ditched Big Brother?
brother? -Big Sister.
Yeah, she's not gonna follow us.
what's with the sack of hammers? -I said bring one.
you said to surprise you.
you're worried about Peter.
I happen to have an arsenal of hammers.
look, you've got half an hour before the exchange.
unless Keller's developed a hammer fetish,
I imagine we're smashing something?
recognize this spot?
I once met a man in this park who claimed to be John Lennon, and I believed him.
the year was 1991. -Mm.
it's where Kate and I used to come.
I used to think one day our kids would play on that playground.
I didn't know you thought about kids.
Yeah.
I thought we'd grow old here.
you were gonna propose?
I had the whole thing worked out, Moz.
remember that street violinist? -Caesar.
I had him learn "Everybody Loves Somebody."
he was gonna spontaneously break into it when we passed.
why didn't you tell me?
would you have approved?
perhaps not.
but the name "Uncle Mozzie"
does have a certain je ne sais quoi.
I assume you acquired a ring?
Yeah.
I figured it was safer to leave it here than in a safety deposit box when I was in prison.
well, any idiot can rob a bank.
that's the McNally Solitaire.
that's worth at least two...
and a half million at the last appraisal.
I thought we had depleted your resources.
I guess I was still holding out.
for what?
hope...
that she wasn't gone.
well, fate has a way of putting in front of us that which we most try to leave behind.
Dostoevsky?
no, me during my blue period.
are you really willing to give that up for the suit?
keeping Peter alive is more important than holding a candle for someone who isn't.
you should stay hydrated.
Caffrey's on his way to the exchange. -Okay.
did you check in with Ridgefield? -Yeah.
the transfer's in motion.
okay, all right. Terrific.
well, you stay here, all right?
don't talk to him. Don't let him talk to you.
and, uh...
don't take your eyes off him. That's nice.
Lang, did I hear you mention Ridgefield?
keep your mouth shut.
Ridgefield, the private security firm that the government's contracted out to transfer prisoners?
could be. Or maybe I have a cousin Elmo Ridgefield.
sounds to me like you're helping Keller escape during his transfer.
you're meeting Neal for an exchange.
so, you're using whatever he gives you to buy off Ridgefield, and they're gonna let Keller escape during the transfer.
you are a smart guy. You know what?
I genuinely like watching you work.
so, you probably also picked up on the fact that I don't care if you heard us.
which means you don't intend to let me go.
you intend to kill me.
no.
no, I don't intend to kill you.
no, Keller does...
once he's free.
keep an eye on our friend.
um, I'm selling magazines.
uh, Suit Quarterly, anyone?
no? Clearly, I have the wrong house.
it's... it's... it's okay. He's... he's a friend.
we can talk on the patio.
did Neal send you?
no.
I came of my own volition.
look, I don't know anything, and it's killing me.
listen, I don't usually give these guys much credit, but between them and Neal,
Peter's gonna be home in time for dinner tonight.
you know that?
Moz, what you know?
Neal's meeting with the bad guys right now to strike a deal.
he's also giving them what they want to ensure your husband's safe return.
Peter and I had a fight this morning.
I'm sure it was nothing.
no, there's never small fights. It's...
you don't resolve them, they fester.
and this is the first morning that we didn't.
I thought he would have loved that I picked up the dry cleaning.
Seriously? This is about dry cleaning?
I-I'm sorry.
the longest relationship I've had is 11 days.
and then she deflated.
I'm kidding. Go on.
the last thing I said to him was, "Have a wonderful day.
now, I'm guessing, in a fight about dry cleaning, that that's pretty severe.
we're not like most couples, Moz.
we work.
I don't want to lose him.
look, I understand how hard this is, particularly when the suits won't tell you anything.
that's why I want you to have this.
I'm gonna drop a bug in there so you can hear what they hear...
when they hear it.
thank you.
Oh, wow! I have a set of these.
Oh, wait. No.
these aren't Russian military surplus.
Where's Peter?
he's safe.
may I see the item?
Nope.
I see Peter, you see the ring.
those aren't the terms.
I didn't agree to any terms.
first we'll have the ring authenticated and delivered to the Russians, and then we'll release Burke.
you'll get I it when I have proof that Peter's alive.
are you willing to let your agent die?
are you willing to let Keller down?
all right.
we're gonna show Mr. Caffrey proof of life.
you can ask one question.
I'm going to text it to Burke, and he's going to text the answer back.
I want to speak with him.
one question. Make it a good one.
what cellphone number was Caffrey using the first time you caught him?
that's the question?
let me see it.
wait. I don't have my glasses. Bring it closer.
you're lucky your buddy's paying up, or my friends would be sending me a very different message right now.
give me a break. It's been a few years.
okay.
area code 668...
is that correct?
that's right. -Great.
the ring?
you're not gonna authenticate it?
if it's not real, you'll just never see Burke again.
100 bucks. You can't beat that.
Thanks. Sure.
do you mind?
let me get this straight...
you gave them a multimillion-dollar ring, and they still have Peter?
I admit the terms weren't favorable.-You think?
what's the FBI found so far?
Oh, that's right.
I've got proof of life and a message.
how do you even have access to a multimillion-dollar ring?
Oh, that's for another time.
I asked Peter for the phone number I used when I was first arrested.
what, and you didn't have one?
actually, I had several, but I was hoping he'd take the opportunity to pass me a 10-letter message using the keypad.
he told us something.
a cross street, a location, a warning?
not Pam sees?
does he know any blind Pams? -No.
onus border.
worthy of the Times Sunday edition, but it means nothing to me.
no tram seeps.
not ram reds.
got it.
no transfer.
that's got to be it.
Peter wants us to stop Keller's transfer.
it's in progress. Jones is with them.
Jones, we made contact with Peter.
good. Is he all right?
Yeah, but he wants us to stop Keller's transfer.
Why? -I don't know. Just do it.
Diana, the convoy is already on Lafayette.
radio the drivers.
okay, will do.
ridgefield 429, this is agent Jones. Come in.
repeat... Ridgefield 429, this is agent Jones. Come in.
you gonna respond to that?
let's do this!
don't move! Do exactly what I say and you live.
we're secure!
let's go.
ridgefield 429, come in.
come on!
Hey, man, what are you doing?
sorry. The fee's too high for excess baggage.
come on, this wasn't the deal!
he's out!
he's out! Cover the other side!
we've got a runner!
Oh, whoa, whoa, okay.
why is there a tree on your dashboard?
it's a hybrid.
it's showing me how efficiently I'm driving.
you're not driving very green.
all your leaves are falling off.
do you want to catch Keller?
I feel like I'm stuck inside the giving tree...
nothing left but a stump.
I'll grow a new one over the weekend.
Jones, what's going on?
Keller escaped.
alright, the three guards from the transfer bus are in custody.
we've confirmed that Keller paid off two of them and the driver.
lang was paid a ransom...
Caffrey! Berrigan! My office.
um, go over to the hangar.
I'll meet up with you when it's done.
Keller's late.
I wonder what he's planning.
he's a hell of a chess player.
I imagine him sitting in his cell, plotting every second of this escape.
there's something he's not telling you.
Hey, I have the ring, so he's not going anywhere.
with all his debts to the Russian mob and the security firm,
I wouldn't be surprised if he already spent more than it's worth.
shut up.
are you sure you have the real ring?
maybe Keller paid off your people. Hey.
wouldn't be the first time. Now is quiet time.
I get it. The feds hassled you.
they made your life very unpleasant.
so, you thought that you could do one last job and disappear.
he is not gonna hold up his end of the bargain.
you are going down for this. Hey!
I know what I'm doing.
do you understand that?
I shot him once, okay?
and now I'm gonna finish the job.
the only thing is, you're not good with a gun.
you hold it with no secondary support. Uh-huh.
and you use your trigger finger to brace for recoil, which means you shoot off target.
no wonder Keller survived when you first shot him.
you couldn't hit a man 3 feet in front of you with a full magazine.
well, let's give it a try.
we told you to go home.
and you were to take him there!
sir, I know that, but...
but you made an exchange...
exactly what we said we don't do.
sir, in his defense, no one knows Keller better than Neal.
had we interceded in any way, he thought they would have killed Peter.
I'll deal with you later.
right now, we've got a free criminal and a captive agent to get back.
now do your job. Get him out of here.
the exchange was the only way to contact Peter.
and we almost stopped Keller. I know.
I can't just go home.
Neal... you don't have a choice.
thanks for sticking up for me in there.
I'll let you know as soon as I hear something, okay?
this is Jones.
I've got Peter on the line!
Peter, I'm gonna put you on speaker and start a trace.
Burke, it's Hughes.
tell us your location.
I need to talk to Neal.
where are you?
Reese, put Neal on the phone.
I'm here, Peter.
listen carefully.
I'm in a locked cell.
lang is three feet away from me, knocked out next to his gun.
Keller is en route.
you need me to talk you through a jail break.
Yeah.
that's... that's my husband. Put him on speaker.
I'm sorry, Ma'am. I'm not authorized...
you have my husband on the line! Put him on speaker!
the cell is roughly 8x12.
it's made of cement and metal bars.
there's a locked, hinged door.
clear a space. 8x12 perimeter.
let's do it!
the cell's in the middle of a Schmatta-shop basement.
there are cardboard boxes, an old metal chair, a can of soda, which was a gift, two lamps, light bulb, thread, fabric...
and some really creepy mannequins.
okay, tell me about the door.
the cell door has an electronic keypad... Fassbinder ES-320.
Ah, Fassbinder chips are hardwired to a power source, plus a backup battery.
can we disable it with anything here?
uh... Neal?
I'm thinking, Peter! -Think faster.
all right, look... look for the hardwire connection to the lock.
okay, got it. Feels like a thin gauge.
I'm guessing if I cut it...
you'll activate the lock's redundancy mechanism.
no, we need... we need to short the backup before cutting the electricity.
there's a conduit that runs alongside the cell.
follow that conduit to the fuse box.
I got it. It's right on the back wall.
I'm putting you on speaker.
okay, all right, uh...
here's where it gets a little tricky, Peter.
pull back the inside panel.
you'll see two hot wires and a neutral. Strip the neutral.
hang on, I got to make a quick wire stripper out of the soda can.
look at you, improvising without me.
done.
okay, uh...All right, break the light bulb and attach the filament to the battery of your cellphone.
the filament conducts the charge...
which creates a surge, shorts the power, and the locking mechanism should release.
"should"? It will.
has it occurred to you that in order to use my cellphone battery...
we're gonna have to disconnect.
it's the final step, Peter.
Hey.
Oh, God.
we've got a lock on his location...
textile shop off of 9th and 39th.
Burke, stay on the line.
there's team on their way.
there's no time.
come on, Peter.
how long should it take if this works? A few seconds.
please, honey, you can do this.
hang tight, Peter. We're on our way.
I've got Lang at gunpoint.
all right, let's go!
you better hurry.
Keller's on his way, too.
FBI! Don't move!
Jones, it's me! Peter?
Yeah, clear around back.
there he is...
escape artist extraordinaire, Peter Burke.
what happened with Keller?
he hasn't shown.
he won't. He's smarter than that.
who knows... Maybe he never planned on showing, seeing as how he didn't trust Lang.
which would have left Lang with the ring, the debts, and you.
uh, speaking of which...
Oh, right. Yeah, thanks. It's...
before I hand that back to you, is it stolen?
well, it's never been reported as stolen.
listen, if it's legitimately yours, the FBI can't hold onto it.
well, it's been missing for a couple hundred years, but, uh...
it doesn't belong to me.
so...
you may want to contact the Scotland Royal Museum.
what?
Hey, hon.
Hey, hon.
I saw the surprise party you set up for me.
it's very kind. I'm sorry I couldn't make it.
Yeah, me too.
I couldn't have escaped without you, Neal.
but I guess we both got what we wanted, right?
I wouldn't say that.
how about we call this one a draw?
we'll take a break for a while. What do you say?
I'm gonna find you, Keller.
well, that might be tough. I'm already outside your radius.
Hey, Caffrey...
you're starting to sound like a lawman.
could be fun.
what is this?
it's a fractal -- A mathematical curiosity.
it's a fractal antenna.
you're telling me that if we build a real one of these...It's gonna lead us to a boat or a plane or something that disappeared in the 1940s.
I want to know the man who's pulling the trigger.
his name is Vincent Adler.
you knew him?
he's the man who made me who I am today.
why are you helping us?
I like having Neal Caffrey owe me one.
I owe you one.
something like that.
so, as we all know, Mr.Stanzler is very, very specific.
the Bordeaux glasses are only to be served with Cabernet, and in Burgundy glasses, for heaven's sake, only put Pinot in these.
if it smells like paint the next time I walk in here, I will shoot someone.
Mr. Stanzler. Andrew, hi.
skip the pleasantries. You have six seconds.
okay, well, everything's set for Saturday.
and what about the ice sculpture?
uh, the 4x3 ice bear. - 4x3? No. 8 feet.
8 feet? - Did I stutter? 8 feet.
8 feet. I want it bold. - Got it.
8 feet. - Sorry about that.
no, it's okay.
one thing I-I like about your boss -- he knows what he wants.
Yeah.
Brooke? Are -- are you okay?
last week, you said your husband works for the FBI.
Yeah, he -- he does. Is, uh --Is everything all right?
no. It's not.
new Yorkers took to the streets as temperatures soared to triple digits, making today one of the city's hottest days on record.
with east coast hydroelectric reporting record usage, city authorities warn of more rolling blackouts... - I know, Satchmo.
you warned me not to use the central air before the blackout hit.
but I didn't listen cause you're a dog.
so until we get it fixed, meet our new AC. - Oh, it's a hot one.
well, hello, my boys. - Hello.
look at the new air conditioner. - Yeah.
how's the world's most interesting evil man?
actually, we need to talk about Stanzler.
I told you Andrew makes his money as an energy trader, right?
uh...Yeah. - Well, actually, it's worse than that.
I've been working with his assistant, Brooke, and she thinks Stanzler's involved in creating the blackouts.
say that again. - Yeah.
Brooke overheard Stanzler talking about it with another trader.
so she did some digging.
she thinks they're with holding supply during peak hours and then selling energy to the city for triple the rate.
el, these are very serious allegations.
honey, I know.
there are three confirmed deaths, and it's cost the city tens of millions.
that's why I'm telling you.
all right. We have to bring her into the bureau
she doesn't want to come in.
she's terrified that someone's gonna see her and tell Stanzler.
do you know, he actually threatened to shoot the painter today?
Seriously? - Oh, he was half-joking.
but I wouldn't put it past him.
okay. So, where can I talk to Brooke?
well, maybe come down to the museum while Stanzler's out.
that's good. You could bring Heal.
why Neal? - Well, honey, she's really nervous.
and, you know, Neal has a calming smile. - Fine.
I'll bring Neal and his calming smile.
thank you. You're a good boy.
and so are you.
when did you get back in town? - Just a few days ago.
how was Argentina? - It was...hot. But very interesting.
what did you find?
I figured out where those crates we found were being smuggled out of.
it's an estate in southern Argentina.
look what they've done with the place. - Yeah, someone burned it down.
and I'm pretty sure it was Vincent Adler.
I think this is where Adler was hiding after he fled the U.S.
right. This is good.
Yeah. I also met some locals.
and some Llamas. - Yes, and some Llamas.
um, this is Rosa. She worked in Adler' s kitchen.
said he was obsessed with finding a German soldier named Gerhard Wagner.
who is he? - I don't know, but hopefully the FBI can find out.
all right. I will pass this on to Peter.
thank you.
it's good to see you. - You too. Yeah.
are you really going this way? - Yeah.
I hate that. - Awkward goodbyes after you've already said goodbye.
Yeah. I'm gonna grab a coffee. - Bye.
your husband will be here, right?
he'll be here soon.
do you want to go over seating arrangements with Yvonne? - Okay.
Hey, thank God you're here. Where's my husband?
she's kind of losing it. I'm sure he's on his way. He said to meet him here.
um, will you call and see how close he is? - Yeah, of course.
okay. - I just got a text. Andrew's coming.
what do we do? - I-I thought he was in Connecticut.
the meeting got canceled. So I-I got to go.
hold on just a second.
how far away are you?
I had to borrow Diana's car.
I would have been there in 10, but there's an accident on 5th.
so now...17 minutes, plus 1 minute for parking, and I'll still be there 4 minutes early.
okay, hold on.
Yeah, that might not be soon enough.
Stanzler's on his way, too.
all right. Do whatever you need to do to keep her calm.
but don't let her go.
you really miss your air conditioner, don't you?
he made my dog pant.
now this is personal. - Okay.
sorry. - I know, I know. I trust you. I just...
I'm sorry. I can't do this.
Brooke Argyle? - Yes.
Hi. I'm agent Peter Burke. How are you? - Hi.
Hey, hon. - Hey, honey.
thanks for coming. - Of course.
el told me you have information that links Andrew Stanzler to the blackouts.
um, he's outside.
what your boss is doing is wrong, and it's hurting a lot of people.
will you help us?
listen, you can trust my husband.
okay. - Thank you. We'll take care of you, okay?
el will be in touch. - Yeah.
did we really just do that?
did you see any other option? - No.
so, which one of us is gonna tell Peter?
I vote you.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
you impersonated an agent.
you told me to do whatever I needed to do.
I didn't say commit a federal crime.
I convinced her to come in.
Yeah. And now is the time to correct the situation by having her meet the real Peter Burke.
she will blow out those doors so fast you won't see her shadow.
you know why? Cause the lights will be out from the power outage she couldn't help us stop.
you do not get to be me anymore. - That doesn't go there.
what are you doing? Get up! - Peter, she's skittish.
if I try to explain to her that impersonated you, she'll never trust you, me, Elizabeth, or the FBI.
no. Don't touch that.
Hello? Oh, hey, El.
are you downstairs with Brooke? Great.
listen, I talked to Neal, and we're just gonna be honest with her.
Yes. That's all that --Honey, you --Right.
Uh-huh. I understand.
okay. See you in a bit.
Elizabeth talked you into it.
listen up, everybody.
for the next hour and only the next hour, you will call Mr. Caffrey special agent Peter Burke.
no questions. No laughing. Just do it. And never speak of this again.
who? Me? What? - You don't even need him.
what are you --Stay there.
Hey, hon. - Hi, hon.
great to see you. Hi, Brooke.
Hi. - Hi.
I thought we were just gonna be speaking with your husband.
Oh, we were, but, actually, this is, um...Neal Caffrey.
are you an agent, too?
no. No. I wish I was. I'm just a consultant.
so, how does that work?
actually, I'm a criminal.
a criminal?
I've made a lot of really bad life choices, which landed me in prison.
but now I assist the FBI. - Oh. Okay. Good.
as a matter of fact, had it not been for agent Burke here, I'd still be in prison - - rotting. You're giving me way more credit than I deserve.
no, no. Don't be modest, Peter.
you caught me --Twice.
and you can send me back any time you want.
why don't we go talk in my office? - Okay.
so, what role did Stanzler's company play in all this?
Stanzler's company's a broker.
new York's electricity system is a deregulated market.
so if someone bought up enough energy, they could temporarily artificially create a shortage.
don't get any ideas, Neal.
I won't. But I'll talk to the...
you should talk to the commodities trading commission.
um, is there any way you and I could speak --Just the two of us?
I know Neal seems intimidating, but he's very useful in cases like yours.
in fact, I think he's the single most valuable asset we have here at the bureau.
please.
on second thought --Neal. Cream. No sugar.
we have agents for that.
I have something better. I have you.
thank you.
I didn't want to say this in front of your criminal consultant, but I think Stanzler's looking for a burglar.
what's he trying to steal? - I'm not sure.
but I was listening in on a very cryptic phone conversation he had with someone named Bill Rosko.
bill Rosko. - I Googled the name, and Bill has a criminal record for breaking - -Breaking and entering. Yeah.
Oh. Don't you hate it when Peter makes you get coffee?
you're getting me Mocha Chai Latte's for the rest of the month.
Hey, boss. Why is Neal in your office?
Neal is posing as Peter so a witness will tell us about an energy-collusion scam.
awesome! I'm going in.
no. - Come on. Let me bring him a file.
what do you have? - Unh-unh. This is for Peter.
Diana...It's the info Sara requested on Gerhard Wagner.
there's nothing in here. Why is Gerhard Wagner's file empty?
the Department of Defense classified his information when he immigrated to the U.S. After world war II.
Yeah, but that was more than 50 years ago.
I'll make some calls, see if I can get his file declassified.
all right. I'm gonna find out what Brooke had to say to me.
this is gonna be good.
Oh, yeah. - No, no, no.
a thief? Sounds like a job for Neal Caffrey.
Yeah, too bad Stanzler's already made me. I would love to find out what he was trying to steal
you still can. Or the new Neal Caffrey can.
you're serious?
Peter, that's bold thinking, but posing as a thief --Particularly as me...
I mean, we'd be better off sending in any number of competent criminal C.I.'s.
no. I'm retaking control of this case before anything else goes sideways.
talk to Brooke. Have her put Neal Caffrey, thief, on his books.
that's you? - That's me.
welding is a lot harder than it looks.
I deserve a medal.
sorry about the flames.
you want to wear my extra helmet?
I'm good.
nothing like wearing a leather flame suit on the hottest day of the year.
I'm almost back to my fighting weight.
for the last parts for the antenna, I've been scouring ebay Europe.
are you even listening to me?
you wouldn't believe the amount of paperwork required to send someone undercover.
isn't that the suit's job?
Nah, he made me do it since I told a whistle-blower I was Peter Burke.
why would you do that?
we were gonna lose her. I had to.
now I'm stuck with the is 9 form, a.k.a.The whistle-blower declaration of facts.
Yeah. - The same thing holds for impersonating a suit.
get out or I'm gonna find you wearing wing tips.
what do you think?
I'm too late.
the metamorphosis is complete, cockroach. - Thanks, Kafka.
Peter. Sara. What are you doing here?
do I want to know?
not yet. - All right.
tales of the FBI's classified files.
Peter figured out why Adler' s so interested in Wagner.
excellent. Top-secret movies. I'll make popcorn.
butter, please.
when do we get to the good part?
quiet... - in a relentless counter blockade to destroy Britain's shipping.
the man on the left is Gerhard Wagner.
worked as a radio operator in the U-boat headquarters.
after the fall of the third Reich, he fled to America.
he claimed to have top-secret information he wanted to share with the U.S.
gerhard Wagner, however, was sent to a detention center at Ellis Island.
and whatever he knew disappeared with him when he escaped from the detention center a few weeks later.
what kind of top-secret information could Wagner have that Adler would be looking for a half-century later?
I have a feeling it has something to do with the antenna Mozzie's been building.
which makes sense, cause he was a radio guy.
if he escaped the detention center, he may have hopped the fence and gotten in the naturalization line.
why not? Changed his name, became an upstanding citizen. - All right.
we'll check the archives for matches between his physical description and someone who entered Ellis Island around that same time.
listen, uh...Next time you're poking around classified files, see if you can find anything on the death of the electric car.
sure. And I can throw in some stuff about crop circles.
Yes. You're joking.
Mozzie, the U.S. Government is not conducting mind-probe experiments.
that's what they've made you believe.
are we doing this again?
guess so. You headed home?
no, I'm gonna go grab a bite. How about you?
Oh, just to the gym. - Really?
I just -- I took you for more of a "sit-up/push-up in the morning" kind of guy.
I swim. - Yeah? How's that work with your ankle bracelet?
it's waterproof. Are you trained in counter-surveillance?
you talking about the guy at our 6: 00?
so the answer's yes. - yes.
and he knows we made him.
how long do you want to stay here?
we'll see what his next move is.
much better. - That's not fair. It's my game.
Ah, we take turns.
he's making his next move.
you okay? - Yeah.
Yeah, I've been followed before in my line of work.
whoever he is. He knows you're working for us.
so, the emergency exits are here and here.
there's only one entrance to the exhibit and a service corridor.
if you're not planning on robbing the museum, - why would you need to know all this? - It's my in --To impress Stanzler.
you know, it's sexy watching you plan a heist.
yeah? Think I should go rogue? - Yes.
all right. Say goodbye to Peter Burke.
Hi. I'm Caffrey. Neal Caffrey.
what? - Nothing.
you don't like my Neal?
well, he sort of has a way of, I don't know, pulling you in when he talks - - A kind of quiet, sexy whisper.
Oh, sexy, huh? - And he doesn't put his hands on his hips.
right. He gets people to do what he wants by charming them.
he doesn't rely on a badge.
Really? Well, you are so smart.
you have all the answers, and I couldn't do this without you.
much better.
Oh, honey?
you're gonna have to take off your wedding ring.
I am.
feel naked without it.
maybe you could wear a hat.
Mr. Stanzler. This is Neal Caffrey.
who? - Your 11: 00, sir.
I understand you're interested in an acquisition.
I'm sorry? What?
you're interested in an acquisition.
who told you that?
big Bill Rosko.
he said you offered him a job.
Yeah, well, big Bill has a big mouth.
and I never offered him anything.
well, if there is a job, I'm your man. - Yeah.
everybody in your business says the same thing, right?
what if I told you I could rob this place in under 20 minutes?
I'd say good luck. We've got the top-of-the-line security system.
it's good, but nothing's perfect.
two cameras cover the front and back, but they're blind to the side exits.
your roof?
it's a burglar's dream. 1 - inch wood and asphalt.
what exactly would you leave with?
every display is laser-guarded, heat-, motion-, and weight - sensored.
I know.
so I'd skip the display and hit your private collection.
how did you know about that?
like I said. I'm the best.
Stanzler needs a thief to steal a flash drive from this man - Another trader, Francis Luntz. - Slow down, Caffrey.
I want to hear details about the meet. - Quiet, you.
based on their trading records and what little information I got from stanzler, I believe the two are using their combined market power to create temporary shortages.
but did you flaunt your past crimes?
no, I did not flaunt my past crimes.
how did you convince him to hire you?
I'm that good.
these guys are incredibly careful.
from what I can gather, Luntz doesn't trust Stanzler.
he secretly videotape done of their meetings.
now, this video, which is now on flash drive, is what Stanzler wants me to retrieve.
steal. - Steal.
why don't we just use a warrant?
we could, but Stanzler doesn't know exactly what's on the tape.
so if we shake Luntz down and the video is insufficient, we blow our chances of catching either one of these guys.
but I do want a warrant for Luntz's home.
I don't need a warrant to break in.
well, this Neal Caffrey does.
that's it for now.
after we left my apartment last night, Sara and I were followed.
any suspects? - Adler.
I think he put a tail on Sara.
everyone who's looked into him -- Mozzie, Kate --They all got hurt.
where is she now? - At the archives. I'm meeting her there.
good idea. Stay close to her.
all right, but for my break-in, I'm gonna need some training.
I got you covered.
my pupil has arrived.
take the pebble from my palm.
Seriously? Kung fu?
I'm preparing you for your mission.
okay. Give me $20.
look, do you want my help or not?
lesson 1-- we take. We don't give.
now, moving on - Give me my 20 back, or I'm gonna arrest you.
Oh, you're gonna be a very difficult student.
Hey. - Hi.
anyone follow you? - No.
you? - All clear.
they said over the phone that it could take up to four weeks for us to get access to those files.
that's all right. I got a plan.
are you gonna share that plan with me?
any chance you can tell me a little more about what you're looking for?
only that it's regarding an individual who may have come through Ellis Island in 1946.
we need to look through files to match a physical description.
the rest is national security. - You understand.
of course. Sorry I wasn't more helpful over the phone.
she didn't say she was with the FBI.
Oh, she's not.
I am.
please, follow me.
Peter knows.
this is it.
records. Ledgers. Card catalogs.
which ones are from 1946?
all of them.
excuse me.
Yeah, we can do this.
okay, listen up, sausage fingers.
we don't have all day.
Oh, our guest speaker.
Hello, there.
how's he doing?
we'll come back to the lock-picking later.
Byron would be so thrilled to know his training jacket is back in the game.
are you teaching him to run a cross?
scratch on a dip.
with the farmer's pants?
Neal wants to run a bird dog.
Oh. He's a Fed.
can we move on with this?
uh, yes.
now, your first task is to drop a bug into Stanzler's jacket so your little Evil Empire friends in the Vancan listen in on him, while you fumble through the house.
do we need a commentary?
Yes. But dropping the bug isn't the hard part.
retrieving it is --Without jingling the bells.
again.
all right.
this is impossible.
understatement is the key.
these two fingers, like tweezers --So that the thumb will never touch the mark.
it's gonna take a while.
so tell me, repo......why you helping out? What's your angle in all this?
if Adler spent his life searching for something, that means the pay off's got to be bigger than the billion he's already stolen.
that's all?
I like the mystery.
I know what it's like to have a lot of questions.
Really?
when I was 13, my older sister ran away and we never heard from her again.
I'm sorry.
I used to go into her room and just look at her things and hope that something held the key.
you know, if there was a book about dancers, I'd wonder,"is she a ballerina?"
or there was a pony poster. So I wondered if she was off on a ranch somewhere.
and I never found the answers I was looking for.
but...if we find Adler, maybe you can have some closure with Kate.
last chance, suit.
some of us go to work at night.
like this?
you didn't drop the bug. - No, I didn't.
I decided to practice one more lift.
you've learned all I have to teach you.
you, Peter Burke, are ready to commit a crime.
looking sharp, Peter. - Thank you.
there's a very good teacher inside that little shiny head of his.
How' d it goat the archives? - Great. But it's gonna take a while to find Wagner.
another late night with Sara, huh?
Hey, keep your eye on the prize, okay? This is serious. Stanzler doesn't mess around.
now, remember, backup is 10 seconds away - You don't give me the "be careful" speech.
I invented the "be careful" speech.
Yeah, but since I'm you, I should give... - You're Neal in the van, and I'm Neal outside the van.
okay.
then go out there and make me look good.
Mr. Stanzler. When you get to that master bedroom, look for anything called "project Edison."
got it.
my meeting with Luntz will last 20 minutes. You have exactly that to find the video and find your way back to the Bentley.
20 minutes? Plenty of time.
it better be. Otherwise, you're on your own.
let's go.
heads up, guys. I think we're pulling into Luntz's mansion.
out of the vehicle. Headed for the basement door.
good. We got ears on you. - Wait for me to confirm that.
working on the lock now.
okay, we have ears on you.
so, tell me about this guy, Wheelock, your contact at the power company.
what else did he say?
they have budget cuts, fewer controls, which makes monitoring us that much more difficult.
3,000 immigrants a week, and not one of these files is computerized.
well, whoever this Gerhard Wagner is, he has earned my admiration.
how's that?
he worked the system to his advantage.
I mean, one day he was here, and the next -- poof He's vanished into the vast bureaucracy --Like a Germandave Chappelle.
did Neal send you to come sit with me?
no one sends me. I go places.
of course. My mistake.
he's not worried about you, if that's what you're implying.
I'm here for obvious reasons.
well, of course.
I mean, it's impossible to deny this Tracy/Hepburn thing between us.
I do want you, Mozzie. - Please. Control yourself.
I'm here to double the workforce. I want to get Adler, too.
I take that as a sign.
of what?
I'll let you know.
I'm in the master bedroom.
all right. Check the drawers and cabinets.
people usually hide things where they're easily accessible.
as Mozzie taught you.
I found a safe key. "centurion."
centurion. Look for an in-wall safe.
Mrs.Luntz.
well done, Mr. Luntz.
I found the safe.
I found the video.
copying it now.
I'll give the original to Stanzler and keep the backup for us.
guys, listen to this. - This Chip Wheelock, the guy at E.C.H.
-That's east coast hydroelectric.
what exactly does he know?
he knows he wants in.
we got a guy in the power company, flips a switch, rolling blackouts.
we make a fortune.
no. No way. It's too risky.
you mean it's too easy?
look, go to the party on Saturday night.
talk to the guy, spend a few minutes, see what he has to say.
if you don't like it, take a walk.
Peter, Stanzler and Luntz may have an executive from east coast hydroelectric in their pocket.
he's meeting them at the party on Saturday.
all right. We wait until Saturday and take down all three of them.
video's copied.
I'm on my way out.
what's your exit plan?
same as my entrance plan.
did you get it?
Yeah.
very good.
it's been a pleasure. - Want another job?
what do you have in mind? - Geller museum. Saturday. 5: 00. Tell no one. Ask no questions. I'll pay you double.
okay. - Okay.
after the first outage, we will clear seven figures each. I'm not committing to anything today.
this is what was on the drive.
Luntz recorded this meeting and kept his mouth shut, even though, we believe, he went on to participate.
on Saturday, Stanzler's trying to bring in this man to sweeten the pot.
chip Wheelock, senior manager at east coat hydroelectric.
with someone at the power plant able to flip the switch, they'll be able to escalate their plan.
that means more blackouts. - Not if we stop them.
I've been invited to an event as Neal, so we can take advantage of this opportunity by slipping a video feed on Stanzler.
how are we gonna do that?
Brooke was able to get Stanzler's suit from the dry cleaner.
we installed a camera in place of the lapel button.
check this out.
nice.
Brooke will make sure that Stanzler's wearing that jacket.
Jones, Diana, you'll be in the van.
always. - I like the van.
and, as a precaution, I'll be accompanying Elizabeth...as my wife's husband.
tell your staff they get $100 each if they don't spill anything. They get fired if they do.
el said you knew how to motivate your employees.
that's the smallest 8-foot bear I've ever seen in my life.
I've got Stanzler's camera online.
anything Stanzler sees, we'll see.
Neal, have you met Peter and Elizabeth Burke?
Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.
this is my lovely wife, Elizabeth. - You married up.
telling me.
I could use a drink right now.
Yes, I'll have one, too. - Yeah, me too. Thank you.
Mr. Stanzler, Mr. Luntz is here.
want to help me out here for a second?
Yeah, you're the boss.
ladies having fun?
so this is undercover work, huh?
I'm sure Peter's hating every second of it.
and you? How does it feel to be an FBI agent?
still trying it on. The job certainly has its perks.
excuse us, ladies. - What are we doing?
your assignment.
everyone hear that? Showtime.
copy that, Peter.
you donated all this? - Yeah.
I'd like you to babysit. My friend Francis there is not having a very good day.
that's my assignment? Babysit Luntz?
Yeah. I'll have more for you when I get back.
a lot on your mind? - Yeah.
listen, I'm glad that, uh, Stanzler let us alone for a couple minutes.
I don't know what he told you, but I'm not interested.
I mean, this thing --It's gotten way beyond what I ever imagined.
you two --You do what you want. But I'm out.
sorry, Wheelock.
wait. Yeah, wait. Francis...
he told you I was Chip Wheelock? - Yeah. Are you not?
excuse me a minute.
I know about your energy scheme with Stanzler.
you what?- He's planning to double-cross you.
he -- he can't do that. I have leverage over him.
actually, you don't.
Stanzler had me break into your estate and steal the video.
who the hell are you?
Jones, we're locked in the Stanzler gallery.
Yeah, this is Jones. You sure?
guys, another blackout's about to sweep through this sector.
Diana, find Elizabeth. - Elizabeth.
backup generator? - Uh, downstairs.
let's get down there.
Where's the team? - On their way in.
who you talking to? - The FBI.
of course. Perfect.
Stanzler told you that Wheelock would be here to lure you out.
Why? - My guess?
when the power goes out, he can circumvent the security cameras and come back here unnoticed.
what's the point?
Oh, geez. He's gonna kill me.
if I'm right, he's gonna try to kill us both.
who's got eyes on Stanzler?
all right. I see him. He's on the far side of the room. I'm on him.
ladies and gentlemen, due to the blackout, this museum is now in lockdown.
FBI! Everyone stay where you are!
remain calm!
Oh, come on.
can you open this?
Peter, Stanzler's making his move.
he's out of the atrium, but I can't tell his location.
Peter's in the Stanzler gallery. We need to get a key.
Yes, sir.
hurry up. Hold this.
I wasn't trained to do this in the dark.
Peter, there's another light in that room. It's Stanzler. He's got a gun.
we're at the generator. It's been disengaged.
can you turn it on?
FBI! Drop it! You're surrounded, Stanzler.
like he said. FBI has you surrounded.
I didn't know you had moves like that. - I didn't know I authorized a badge.
well, I need one. I was an FBI agent.
was. - Was.
you enjoyed being me.
I admit there's a certain allure to your profession. How about you?
being Neal Caffrey has its charms.
ignoring convention? Embracing your ID?
and I do look good in black. - You do.
I have a feeling I had to work a lot harder fitting into your world than you did fitting into mine.
I don't know about that.
good work.
got the generator back on. - I couldn't leave you in the dark.
welcome home, agent Burke. - It's good to be home, Mrs.Burke.
Oh! Thank you. I was starving.
Mozzie's in the other room looking at microfiche.
how was your night? - Oh, the usual.
yeah? What' d you get me?
Oh, I love gourmet finger food. Is that...
guess the blackout finally caught up to this grid.
m- mozzie gave me a lantern. Sorry.- Let me get out of your way here.
I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry.
uh, Sara...I got some--Uh...Hi, Neal.
what do you got?
uh, the, um, urgency transcends the awkwardness.
I found Gerhard Wagner.
every characteristic matches --Height, eye color, facial structure.
uh, you missed a button.
registered with immigration under the name Michael Hunter.
let's go find him.
Oh, w-we can't. Um, he died here in New York.
the obit says he has one surviving family member.
a granddaughter.
who's Alex Hunter?
I thought I knew.
this is Alex. I'm headed to the location now.
I'm on my way.
peter: Vincent Adler - He's looking for a sunken U-boat off the New York coast.
I just want to say that if we're gonna continue working together, then we really should not ignore the other night.
look, it was... - hot.
the Chrysler building.
painting it for your girlfriend?
it calms the nerves.
Neal: my God.
you found it.
it's Nazi plunder...From all over Europe.
this has got to be worth billions of dollars.
get down!
you did this.
Peter, those were masterpieces. I would never burn them. You know that.
but you'd steal them. - Then prove it.
we've got to hurry.
we're almost loaded.
it's the Feds. Let's get out of here.
get around the front of that plane.
team one, flank left. Team three, flank right. Box him in!
we cannot let Caffreyget airborne!
we're not gonna make it. - We don't have a choice, Moz.
we have to make it.
what color are your eyes? - Blue.
are you a criminal consultant for the federal bureau of investigation?
Yes.
okay. For a baseline, I'm gonna need you to tell a lie.
I've never told a lie.
great. We've got our baseline.
ask him about the warehouse.
shortly before his death, you confronted Vincent Adler outside of a warehouse.
what was in that warehouse?
a U-boat - German, recently dredged off the coast of New York state.
and inside of that U-boat?
a collection of art plundered by the Nazis.
what happened?
the warehouse burst into flames.
did you steal the art?
no.
do you know who did?
no.
jones: according to the readout, he's telling the truth.
it's 2: 00 in the morning, Peter.
you gonna keep me here all night?
until I'm satisfied.
next question.
Hey. - Hi.
you look exhausted. Everything okay?
Oh, just - long night.
Sara, Peter may come to you and ask some questions.
about what? - He thinks the art didn't burn.
how's that possible?
Oh, he thinks you took it.
I was off-anklet when it could have happened.
so you need an alibi.
what is it you're hoping I tell him? - The truth.
about the other night. You want me to tell him everything?
cause that could get really very awkward.
skip the good parts. - Yeah.
did you take it? - No.
do you believe me?
you're a damn good con man.
if that art is out there...Any idea who has it?
her name is Iolana.
she from any island in particular?
whichever one your heart desires.
so, I guess this was from you?
how? - It wasn't easy.
the warehouse?
I worked backwards from the transmitter you wired into the limo. Security?
I got around it with a localized E.M. Burst. - And the art?
Adler had it loaded onto a truck. The swap wasn't hard.
and the TNT we got off the sub was unstable and easy to detonate.
a perfect cover.
you didn't tell me.
plausible deniability and all.
we finally got our white whale.
in Hawaiian, her name means "to soar..."Which is exactly what we're gonna do in a very short time.
well, it's not that easy.
I just spent five hours in interrogation with Peter. He suspects something.
all the more reason for haste.
how long to get things ready? - Just a few days.
I can lull Peter. But we don't rush this.
we take our time. We do it right.
to our best and final score.
I passed your lie detector. - I've seen you do that before.
are you saying I cheated?
I've seen you do that before.
all right, if you're not gonna talk to me, let's at least just keep it civil, okay? - Fine.
how bout them meets?
what's wrong? Hmm?
what happened that turned you against me?
I turned against you?
Peter, we're a team. - Ohh.
we did this.
this is our job.
let's not make a big deal out of it.
you're smiling.
I am.
tell me about Gary Rydell.
that's you. - Yeah, it is.
regale me.
Oh, it was an alias I used years ago.
Rydell was a bit of a playboy with an uncanny ability to wreck expensive cars.
of course. Anything else?
he was a world-class fencer.
And?
Neal, I've read the file. - And a smuggler.
a world-class smuggler.- Yeah, I get it.
you think I might activate my Rydell alias in order to sneak something out of the country, something like a stolen Nazi treasure?
crossed my mind. I think this guy is looking for Rydell.
I want to know why.
you know him. - Yeah. We met a few years ago.
he was selling pre - Columbian art, and I was - Buying.
Yeah, buying.
lawrence was also suspected of robbing $60 million from the federal reserve.
he fled the country on a commercial jet before we could make the arrest.
we think he left the $60 million behind.
well, safe assumption. I mean, the baggage fees alone would've cost a fortune.
two days ago, we traced an e-mail he sent to a server here in New York.
lawrence wants you to help him smuggle the cash out of the country.
you want me to strike up a deal with him and lead you to the $60 million.
we'll let you know when we make contact.
uh, you really think he's gonna take this risk?
if you were one step away from pulling off the biggest score in your life...Could you let it go?
Peter's not playing a hunch. He knows something. - Impossible.
so, there's nothing from the heist that could be tied back to me?
you know that art studio where you keep all the paintings you've done?
what about it? - Now it's just a studio.
you switched my art for the art on the sub?
Neal, you're talented, but Van Dyck has you beat. - I can't believe it.
look, they ran forensics tests on the burned warehouse.
they needed to find traces of paint and canvas.
do you know what this means? Nothing could survive that fire.
nothing should have survived the fire. - Thank you.
honey, you've been staring at that all night.
he took it, El. I know he took the art.
I'm standing there, watching the warehouse go up in flames, and this floats down at my feet.
it's a piece of the same painting that was in his apartment.
you're positive it's the same?
how many paintings like this could there be of the Chrysler building?
actually, you'd be surprised.
art deco started in Paris, so there was a lot of European interest in the Chrysler.
Yeah, here. It's been around, what, 80 years?
here it is. Countless artists would interpret the Chrysler's majesty using a variety of styles and techniques.
it was built in 1931. Could've been on the sub.
or maybe Neal painted it.
or maybe you've been chasing him for so long, you don't know how to stop.
or maybe I know him better than anyone else.
if not him, then Mozzieor Alex.
Neal's involved -Somehow.
well, there's a way you can find out. Have the forensics team test it.
if it's from the 1930s, then you know it's not his.
I can't involve the bureau -Not yet.
if I'm right...And Neal's behind this...He goes down.
and so do I.
I could have it tested.
you have a lab in the basement I don't know about?
no, the Dearmitt gallery. They go through private labs to authenticate work.
it's been years since you worked there.
I keep in touch.
you could call in a favor?
for you? Anything.
we made contact with Lawrence through your Rydelle - mail account.
peter: he wants to meet you at the Gramercy Fencing Club in a few hours.
why can't guys like you ever just grab a beer?
imported or domestic?
just meet with him, lead us back to the cash. I'm pulling your anklet.
as usual. - Don't get cocky. We'll be listening.
and I'll be close.
thank you.
good to see you again.
it is good to be seen, Gary. You know, I missed this place.
beauty here -They encourage disguises.
who are you hiding from?
you never can be too careful.
is that why I haven't seen you in the last six years?
Oh, I retired to the islands.
my friend, if you're retired...Then why aren't we playing shuffle board?
I haven't heard of you in the last six years, either, Gary.
how do I know you're still on your game?
maybe I'm that good. - Or maybe you lost a step.
that was my tie. Come on.
show me you're still as good as the Gary RydellI used to know.
well, I'm still using a french grip...still a fan of the depassement attaque.
let's get to the point -You stole $60 million but couldn't get it out of the country. Now you need me to move it for you.
tell me I'm wrong.
nice attaque compos? i.e. Feint left, thrust right - My signature.
I remember.
get me and the green out of the country, and you will earn 10% - 20%.
well, I'm in no position to argue.
Where's the cash? - Close.
set it up. I'll be in touch.
it is cruel and unusual punishment for you to bring me back here like this.
Yes, but I'm finally smiling.
what's your plan for moving Lawrence' s money?
I'll take it out by boat.
why a boat?
one, we're talking about a large shipment that's easier to move on the water than by air.
and, two, it's easier to pay off dock workers than TSA employees.
sold. Diana, I want a team at the harbor.
you got it.
blue.
I've driven you to dumpster dive?
a souvenir of Neal Caffrey's imperfect moment? Priceless.
you shouldn't have! - Grandma insisted.
Oh, you're both so thoughtful!
Mozzie, you, of course, know June's beautiful granddaughter.
Oh. Hi, Cindy.
grandma said the two of you have been, uh, up to something in here.
Oh, you know, idle hands and all. - And they brought us coffee!
Oh, and cookies!
I'll be back for the tray.
no. No, no. Don't trouble yourself.
Mozzie: yeah. We'll bring it down.
everything looks beautiful. Yeah.
Hey, um...Thanks again for everything. Thanks. - Thank you.
lovely girl. - I'm gonna miss this place.
Yeah, and the views.
all right. Peter's team is setting up a harbor sting.
Oh, well, perfect. So while the FBI is busy collaring Lawrence by sea, we'll be making our escape paravion...By air.
I have procured our get away vehicle.
behold -The 400 seriestwin otter.
is it big enough?
think of it as a Kardashian -What it lacks in refinement, it makes up forin cargo space.
you're not sold.
no, the plane's great. I'm just - I'm worried about Peter.
he's holding something, Moz. If he's got a card he hasn't played yet, we're not gonna get far.
okay. So, what's the best way to find out what Peter knows?
Hey, Neal. - Hey.
Peter's not here. - I know.
I want to see you.
I was hoping we could talk.
come on in. Thank you.
you, um...Want some coffee?
I never say no to good coffee.
okay. Well, then, why don't I pour, and you tell me why you dropped by knowing my husband's not here?
I don't know.
he suddenly doesn't trust me. - I don't know how sudden it is.
I don't know - Breaking out of prison, stealing the music box, almost shooting Fowler. You want me to go on?
not particularly, no.
look, he wants to trust you, but you have this - I don't know - habit of doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.
you're saying I'm impulsive but I have a good heart?
maybe you can try and balance the two?
you make a fair point.
and a great cup of coffee. But I like a little bit of milk in mine.
Yes. Okay.
tell me when.
when.
to the right things...For the right reasons.
picked up a copy on the way home. And you're sure Mrs.Suit was intentionally hiding it from you? - Yes.
you know, I guess a part of meal ways knew when push comes to shove, she'd choose Peter.
well, he's her husband.
Yeah, have they ever swapped ossobuco recipes? Which apparently means nothing.
wait a minute.
this has to be it.
the Chrysler building? - Yeah, Peter was here the night before the fire.
this painting was on that easel. He commented on it.
you remember?
did you put it on the sub?
you know, in all honesty, I - it wasn't one of your better works.
what if it didn't burn, Moz? - if he had it, you'd be in cuffs already.
no. I know him. He'd want to be sure.
so he gave it to the Feds to run some tests to see if the painting predated the sub as opposed to, say, last week.
if the bureau ran the tests, he'd have the results by now.
he doesn't want the FBI involved.
he doesn't want it on the record. - Why not?
to protect me. Or to protect himself. - Maybe.
so, if he didn't give it to the FBI lab, who else could test it?
Yeah, she comes from an art background, and she knows about the painting.
I should keep an eye on her.
it's worth a shot, Haversham.
beautiful day, Gary.
Yes, it is.
I was wondering if you'd show.
I didn't come this far to back out now.
I wasn't ruling it out.
every day that money sits there, just out of reach.
comes a point where you finish the job or it finishes you.
you get caught, you lose everything.
already lost everything. When I ran, I ran fast. Didn't look back.
So...How's this gonna work?
on your go, the ingenieur Minard will provide you and your cargo safe and discrete passage to the island of Santo Antao.
all the documentation you may need upon arrival is in that envelope - I.D.passport, everything.
getting in isn't my concern. It's getting out.
four steps.
step one, we move your money here by truck.
step two, my inside manat the gate, Mr.Ryan in customs, looks the other way while we transport you and your cargo to the vessel.
step four, Mr. Ryan files faux routing papers.
anyone comes looking for you, they'll start their search in Calais, France, 4,000 miles from your actual location.
not bad. But you skipped step three.
step three is the reason you hired me.
handle your end. Trust me to handle mine.
Caffrey's pretty planning an escape.
Yeah. Until Lawrence makes his move, he knows we'll keep his anklet off.
you're gonna let him walk around unmonitored?
no.
you are to check in every two hours on the hour.
you go from home to the office, and that's it. - I know the drill.
you're not off anklet for good behavior.
after Lawrence gets you to his money, take him to the harbor.
we've been over this. Anything else?
Yeah. What's step three?
step three is you arrest him.
good thing you didn't tell him.
I thought you might like that.
heard you talked to El.
look, Peter, whatever you think I have done, you and me hey. We're on the same team.
Really?
Yes.
may I?
Yes. Get out! - Thank you.
talk to you in two hours. - And two hours after that.
that's what I like to hear.
Hey, Moz. Our hunch may be correct.
Mrs.Suit is chatting up her old boss at the Dearmitt gallery.
what' d she say?
Oh, what a spring we're having.
blah blah blah.
Oh, she's asking him about a lab test.
Oh! S-she's giving him a scrap of burnt painting.
is it mine?
Oh, sweet Elvis Costello! It's your Chrysler painting!
it didn't burn.
flame is a fickle mistress.
we're gonna have to steal it.
no. No, no, no, no.
Peter will suspect me.
let them run the tests. We'll swap it out.
risky but not impossible.
we need a swatch of canvas and some paints from the 1930s. Which we have in great supply.
all right. Meet me at the warehouse. I'm on my way.
where are you?
I've got a tail.
What?! - Have you started?
of course I started, but without you here,
I'm not sure which colors to sample, so this whole thing might bean exercise in futility.
just pull the primaries. I can mix the rest.
I'm not an idiot.
I scraped a titanium white from the Rembrandt, a midnight blue from a Vlaminck.
Oh, you should get a monestial blue.
you know, I should get a monestial blue.
if you find one thick enough, feel free to let me know.
Oh, that's right -You're not here!
breathe, Moz.
how are we doing on the canvas? Did you check the Dal?
Evidently...Our friend Salvador liked to stretch time but not canvases.
I'll find something.
I know you will.
practicing?
Yeah, I figured I should have a copy of the Chrysler lying around in case Peter came looking for it.
you get everything?
some canvas and a spectrum of prewar paint that would pass any wood's light or I.R. Spectroscopy they want to throw at it.
the red is from a portrait of Fernande Olivier.
the last person to mix this paint was Picasso.
we're taking from masters.
Oh, Picasso was a communist. He'd be happy to share.
what's the plan for the gallery?
the plan for the gallery.
I pried some information from a loose-lipped gallerist.
they're sending our swatch out to an authentication lab at 11: 00 a.m. Tomorrow morning.
the gallery opens at 10: 30, so we have 30 minutes to get inside, make the switch, then get out.
it's gonna be close. Security?
a standard Schlagel on the door, with surveillance cameras.
we'll need a distraction while I pick it.
I can't buy you that much time by myself.
how about a Kansas city mud slide?
you gonna work the jackhammer?
no.
let's run a Phoebe Cates.
who's the girl?
I don't think June would mind if we used her granddaughter.
well, she's pretty enough.
will she do it without asking questions?
I'm sure she's up for a little excitement.
Excellent!
Oh - now onto the bigger question.
how do you plan on losing your tail, outside evolution?
I'll take a page from Magritte.
Ah, you got to be kidding me.
did I win?
the contest -"wear a dark suit, fedora,"come to 23rd and 10th. Best-dressed wins 500 bucks.
Yeah. Yeah.
you won!
okay, Moz. You're up.
Hey, I have a delivery for a Thomas Johnson.
you just missed him.
Tom took a job in Boston. His last day was Monday.
Oh, damn. Can't blame him, though.
boston's a hell of a town.
something I can help you with?
no, I'm just admiring the view.
nice, huh?
Yeah.
look what I did. I got it all over me.
there is something very seriously wrong with me.
today of all days. Would you mind holding this?
Oh. Uh, sure.
and could you take this?
o - okay, but - And I'm gonna need you to hold this up for me.
Oh. Of course.
whoa, whoa, whoa! Miss! You can't take your top off here.
look, I don't think you get it.
I can't be late today, okay? My boss will kill me if I'm late.
C - come on, man. Let her change!
Yeah. I guess it couldn't hurt.
uh, just be quick about it, okay?
Thanks, guys, really.
you have no idea what this means to me.
Oh, or... Us.
which top do you like?
this or this?
uh, th-the second one.
you guys are wonderful.
Yeah, just a couple of working stuffs doing what we can to help out a lady in distress.
almost there.
perfect. We are good to go.
great.
you are a life saver.
you too.
screw Boston. This is a hell of a town.
Hey, Peter. You gave Jones a nice runaround.
that was Jones?
I thought that could've been Lawrence. I didn't want to blow my cover.
why'd you put Jones on me?
you really want me to answer that?
you at home? - Where else would I be?
what are you doing?
you know, arts and crafts - The usual.
jones will be at your place in 20 minutes.
he's gonna stay on you.
you're gonna let him.
no problem. - Bye.
so, I'm getting everything in place at the warehouse.
the plane is fueled and ready.
you know Jones is outside, right?
Yeah. Once I get Lawrence and his money to the docks, I can slip him again.
by the time Lawrence is being hauled downtown, we'll be sipping champagne at cruising altitude.
so, when's "go" time?
Lawrence' s text came in two minutes ago.
why didn't you tell me?
this is it!
we take our time. We do it right.
look, you know, everything good must one day come to an end.
just think -We're never gonna see anything in this apartment again
except you. You can come with me.
Hey. What are you doing?
I should say something to June.
Hey. You know the rules.
no goodbyes.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss her, too.
I'm...gonna miss all of it.
come on.
I'll see you downstairs. - Okay.
goodbye, Caffrey.
lawrence made contact?
I'm on my way to the Fencing Club to meet him now.
update me when you have the money.
jones will back your play if anything goes wrong.
I'm heading to the harbor now.
all right.
everything in place?
only thing left is the money.
the Federal Reserve job - It was flawless.
probably the most secure vault in the world, and I walked out with $60 million.
it was Prometheus...Stealing fire from the Gods.
Prometheus got caught.
Yes, he did. Yes, he did.
and the FBI closed in - fast.
every account, P.O.Box, storage locker, friends, relatives, apartments. They were all over me.
I need to get out fast, stash the money.
I thought I'd be back in 48 hours to collect it, but the Feds were there, waiting.
instead, I was on a plane headed south of the border.
every morning, I'd check the news, waiting to hear the report - $60 million found in Gramercy Fencing Club.
it's here?
there are five ducts to this room.
I diverted air to two of them.
there it is - $60 million.
you know how many times I pictured this in my head?
is this how you thought it'd feel?
no.
better.
what's going on?
someone knows we're here.
agent Jones.
what are you doing here?
talk, or I shoot.
you tailing my friend here?
answer him.
were you following me?
I don't know who you are.
I'm on Lawrence.
how many your friends you got out there?
I followed a hunch.
I'm by myself.
they probably know about the dock.
the whole thing is blown.
kill him. Dump the body.
W - wait a second.
this guy is useless dead.
alive, he's leverage.
for what?
you forgot step three.
attaque compos? i.e. - Feint left, thrust right.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about a backup plan.
when it all goes to hell, this is why you hire me.
I've got a plane.
now boarding - Freedom airlines, flight number one and only.
I'm here with the client.
we're putting step three into effect.
step three? Neal, what are you talking about?
the client and I are moving the cargo to the airstrip.
client? Don't tell me you're talking about Lawrence.
that's right.
no. No, no, no. Don't do this to us.
make sure it's gassed up and good to go.
all right?
grab your suit and meet me there.
what? No suits.
no suits on the island!
no sign of Caffrey and Lawrence.
still no answer from Jones.
this is taking way too long.
you better have a good reason for calling.
I'm in the middle of something very important, Mozzie.
Yeah, you and me both, suit.
I'm passing on a message from Neal.
he's made a request for our presence, without the slightest regard for the monumental inconvenience it causes us -Primarily, me.
van Buren airstrip.
30 minutes.
moving out.
Neal, we got to hurry.
I said,"suit,"not "costume."
don't worry. The suit got the message.
load the fed up front.
why aren't we flying?
you sure you can fly this thing?
get around the front of that plane.
team one, flank left. Team three, flank right. Box him in!
we cannot let Caffrey get airborne!
Lolana, it wasn't supposed to be like this.
get us out of here.
we're not gonna make it.
we don't have a choice, Moz.
we have to make it.
climb.
we need more speed.
climb now!
watch out!
come out now with your hands up!
let me see your hands!
we're secure!
lawrence is on the plane!
you okay? - I'm good.
you all right, Jones? - Yeah.
Caffrey had my back.
sorry... Amelia.
luckily, I was here to save the day once again.
you're a hero, Moz. I'll sew you a cape.
do that. I look good in aubergine.
thank you.
step three, huh?
the part where you arrest him.
nice work.
Thanks.
Ah, the anklet.
Hey, hon. Hey. Good day?
uh, we caught a bad guy, so it wasn't a bad day.
well.
this should make you feel even better.
authentication from the gallery.
the canvas is mid-1930s.
so, it wasn't Neal's painting.
well, unless he painted it 75 years ago.
Hi, Peter.
I let myself in.
Yeah. Yeah, you did.
just clearing out some space for storage.
you like that one?
Yeah.
you can have it.
I've already got the view.
I'm calling a truce.
I may have rushed to judgment.
Oh, you had judgment on speed dial.
I'm trying to be gracious.
you kept my severed tie.
I was pretty pissed off.
and now?
look at this. I'm smiling again.
I like it.
I got to go.
okay.
door's open anytime.
Thanks.
what do you have?
E.R.T.'s still doing a clean up of the warehouse and the U-boat burn.
they found this about an hour ago.
what is it?
part of the original German U-boat manifest.
we can make out 22 of the paintings that were on board.
who else knows about this?
uh, two people on the evidence recovery team, Jones, and me.
keep it that way.
we have to sell something.
Why?
well, our first escape was compromised.
we have to fund the second.
you still think Caffrey has the art?
I don't know.
he did have that get away plane ready awfully fast.
Yeah. Yeah. But you know what? That doesn't matter.
patience is our best asset right now.
whoever stole it, if a single item on this list shows up anywhere. We got 'em.
Yeah. We got 'em.
simple question
peter: Vincent Adler - He's looking for a sunken U-boat off the New York coast.
I just want to say that if we're gonna continue working together, then we really should not ignore the other night.
look, it was... - hot.
the Chrysler building.
painting it for your girlfriend?
it calms the nerves.
Neal: my God.
you found it.
it's Nazi plunder...From all over Europe.
this has got to be worth billions of dollars.
get down!
you did this.
Peter, those were masterpieces. I would never burn them. You know that.
but you'd steal them. - Then prove it.
we've got to hurry.
we're almost loaded.
it's the Feds. Let's get out of here.
get around the front of that plane.
team one, flank left. Team three, flank right. Box him in!
we cannot let Caffreyget airborne!
we're not gonna make it. - We don't have a choice, Moz.
we have to make it.
what color are your eyes? - Blue.
are you a criminal consultant for the federal bureau of investigation?
Yes.
okay. For a baseline, I'm gonna need you to tell a lie.
I've never told a lie.
great. We've got our baseline.
ask him about the warehouse.
shortly before his death, you confronted Vincent Adler outside of a warehouse.
what was in that warehouse?
a U-boat - German, recently dredged off the coast of New York state.
and inside of that U-boat?
a collection of art plundered by the Nazis.
what happened?
the warehouse burst into flames.
did you steal the art?
no.
do you know who did?
no.
jones: according to the readout, he's telling the truth.
it's 2: 00 in the morning, Peter.
you gonna keep me here all night?
until I'm satisfied.
next question.
Hey. - Hi.
you look exhausted. Everything okay?
Oh, just - long night.
Sara, Peter may come to you and ask some questions.
about what? - He thinks the art didn't burn.
how's that possible?
Oh, he thinks you took it.
I was off-anklet when it could have happened.
so you need an alibi.
what is it you're hoping I tell him? - The truth.
about the other night. You want me to tell him everything?
cause that could get really very awkward.
skip the good parts. - Yeah.
did you take it? - No.
do you believe me?
you're a damn good con man.
if that art is out there...Any idea who has it?
her name is Iolana.
she from any island in particular?
whichever one your heart desires.
so, I guess this was from you?
how? - It wasn't easy.
the warehouse?
I worked backwards from the transmitter you wired into the limo. Security?
I got around it with a localized E.M. Burst. - And the art?
Adler had it loaded onto a truck. The swap wasn't hard.
and the TNT we got off the sub was unstable and easy to detonate.
a perfect cover.
you didn't tell me.
plausible deniability and all.
we finally got our white whale.
in Hawaiian, her name means "to soar..."Which is exactly what we're gonna do in a very short time.
well, it's not that easy.
I just spent five hours in interrogation with Peter. He suspects something.
all the more reason for haste.
how long to get things ready? - Just a few days.
I can lull Peter. But we don't rush this.
we take our time. We do it right.
to our best and final score.
I passed your lie detector. - I've seen you do that before.
are you saying I cheated?
I've seen you do that before.
all right, if you're not gonna talk to me, let's at least just keep it civil, okay? - Fine.
how bout them meets?
what's wrong? Hmm?
what happened that turned you against me?
I turned against you?
Peter, we're a team. - Ohh.
we did this.
this is our job.
let's not make a big deal out of it.
you're smiling.
I am.
tell me about Gary Rydell.
that's you. - Yeah, it is.
regale me.
Oh, it was an alias I used years ago.
Rydell was a bit of a playboy with an uncanny ability to wreck expensive cars.
of course. Anything else?
he was a world-class fencer.
And?
Neal, I've read the file. - And a smuggler.
a world-class smuggler.- Yeah, I get it.
you think I might activate my Rydell alias in order to sneak something out of the country, something like a stolen Nazi treasure?
crossed my mind. I think this guy is looking for Rydell.
I want to know why.
you know him. - Yeah. We met a few years ago.
he was selling pre - Columbian art, and I was - Buying.
Yeah, buying.
lawrence was also suspected of robbing $60 million from the federal reserve.
he fled the country on a commercial jet before we could make the arrest.
we think he left the $60 million behind.
well, safe assumption. I mean, the baggage fees alone would've cost a fortune.
two days ago, we traced an e-mail he sent to a server here in New York.
lawrence wants you to help him smuggle the cash out of the country.
you want me to strike up a deal with him and lead you to the $60 million.
we'll let you know when we make contact.
uh, you really think he's gonna take this risk?
if you were one step away from pulling off the biggest score in your life...Could you let it go?
Peter's not playing a hunch. He knows something. - Impossible.
so, there's nothing from the heist that could be tied back to me?
you know that art studio where you keep all the paintings you've done?
what about it? - Now it's just a studio.
you switched my art for the art on the sub?
Neal, you're talented, but Van Dyck has you beat. - I can't believe it.
look, they ran forensics tests on the burned warehouse.
they needed to find traces of paint and canvas.
do you know what this means? Nothing could survive that fire.
nothing should have survived the fire. - Thank you.
honey, you've been staring at that all night.
he took it, El. I know he took the art.
I'm standing there, watching the warehouse go up in flames, and this floats down at my feet.
it's a piece of the same painting that was in his apartment.
you're positive it's the same?
how many paintings like this could there be of the Chrysler building?
actually, you'd be surprised.
art deco started in Paris, so there was a lot of European interest in the Chrysler.
Yeah, here. It's been around, what, 80 years?
here it is. Countless artists would interpret the Chrysler's majesty using a variety of styles and techniques.
it was built in 1931. Could've been on the sub.
or maybe Neal painted it.
or maybe you've been chasing him for so long, you don't know how to stop.
or maybe I know him better than anyone else.
if not him, then Mozzieor Alex.
Neal's involved -Somehow.
well, there's a way you can find out. Have the forensics team test it.
if it's from the 1930s, then you know it's not his.
I can't involve the bureau -Not yet.
if I'm right...And Neal's behind this...He goes down.
and so do I.
I could have it tested.
you have a lab in the basement I don't know about?
no, the Dearmitt gallery. They go through private labs to authenticate work.
it's been years since you worked there.
I keep in touch.
you could call in a favor?
for you? Anything.
we made contact with Lawrence through your Rydelle - mail account.
peter: he wants to meet you at the Gramercy Fencing Club in a few hours.
why can't guys like you ever just grab a beer?
imported or domestic?
just meet with him, lead us back to the cash. I'm pulling your anklet.
as usual. - Don't get cocky. We'll be listening.
and I'll be close.
thank you.
good to see you again.
it is good to be seen, Gary. You know, I missed this place.
beauty here -They encourage disguises.
who are you hiding from?
you never can be too careful.
is that why I haven't seen you in the last six years?
Oh, I retired to the islands.
my friend, if you're retired...Then why aren't we playing shuffle board?
I haven't heard of you in the last six years, either, Gary.
how do I know you're still on your game?
maybe I'm that good. - Or maybe you lost a step.
that was my tie. Come on.
show me you're still as good as the Gary RydellI used to know.
well, I'm still using a french grip...still a fan of the depassement attaque.
let's get to the point -You stole $60 million but couldn't get it out of the country. Now you need me to move it for you.
tell me I'm wrong.
nice attaque compos? i.e. Feint left, thrust right - My signature.
I remember.
get me and the green out of the country, and you will earn 10% - 20%.
well, I'm in no position to argue.
Where's the cash? - Close.
set it up. I'll be in touch.
it is cruel and unusual punishment for you to bring me back here like this.
Yes, but I'm finally smiling.
what's your plan for moving Lawrence' s money?
I'll take it out by boat.
why a boat?
one, we're talking about a large shipment that's easier to move on the water than by air.
and, two, it's easier to pay off dock workers than TSA employees.
sold. Diana, I want a team at the harbor.
you got it.
blue.
I've driven you to dumpster dive?
a souvenir of Neal Caffrey's imperfect moment? Priceless.
you shouldn't have! - Grandma insisted.
Oh, you're both so thoughtful!
Mozzie, you, of course, know June's beautiful granddaughter.
Oh. Hi, Cindy.
grandma said the two of you have been, uh, up to something in here.
Oh, you know, idle hands and all. - And they brought us coffee!
Oh, and cookies!
I'll be back for the tray.
no. No, no. Don't trouble yourself.
Mozzie: yeah. We'll bring it down.
everything looks beautiful. Yeah.
Hey, um...Thanks again for everything. Thanks. - Thank you.
lovely girl. - I'm gonna miss this place.
Yeah, and the views.
all right. Peter's team is setting up a harbor sting.
Oh, well, perfect. So while the FBI is busy collaring Lawrence by sea, we'll be making our escape paravion...By air.
I have procured our get away vehicle.
behold -The 400 seriestwin otter.
is it big enough?
think of it as a Kardashian -What it lacks in refinement, it makes up forin cargo space.
you're not sold.
no, the plane's great. I'm just - I'm worried about Peter.
he's holding something, Moz. If he's got a card he hasn't played yet, we're not gonna get far.
okay. So, what's the best way to find out what Peter knows?
Hey, Neal. - Hey.
Peter's not here. - I know.
I want to see you.
I was hoping we could talk.
come on in. Thank you.
you, um...Want some coffee?
I never say no to good coffee.
okay. Well, then, why don't I pour, and you tell me why you dropped by knowing my husband's not here?
I don't know.
he suddenly doesn't trust me. - I don't know how sudden it is.
I don't know - Breaking out of prison, stealing the music box, almost shooting Fowler. You want me to go on?
not particularly, no.
look, he wants to trust you, but you have this - I don't know - habit of doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.
you're saying I'm impulsive but I have a good heart?
maybe you can try and balance the two?
you make a fair point.
and a great cup of coffee. But I like a little bit of milk in mine.
Yes. Okay.
tell me when.
when.
to the right things...For the right reasons.
picked up a copy on the way home. And you're sure Mrs.Suit was intentionally hiding it from you? - Yes.
you know, I guess a part of meal ways knew when push comes to shove, she'd choose Peter.
well, he's her husband.
Yeah, have they ever swapped ossobuco recipes? Which apparently means nothing.
wait a minute.
this has to be it.
the Chrysler building? - Yeah, Peter was here the night before the fire.
this painting was on that easel. He commented on it.
you remember?
did you put it on the sub?
you know, in all honesty, I - it wasn't one of your better works.
what if it didn't burn, Moz? - if he had it, you'd be in cuffs already.
no. I know him. He'd want to be sure.
so he gave it to the Feds to run some tests to see if the painting predated the sub as opposed to, say, last week.
if the bureau ran the tests, he'd have the results by now.
he doesn't want the FBI involved.
he doesn't want it on the record. - Why not?
to protect me. Or to protect himself. - Maybe.
so, if he didn't give it to the FBI lab, who else could test it?
Yeah, she comes from an art background, and she knows about the painting.
I should keep an eye on her.
it's worth a shot, Haversham.
beautiful day, Gary.
Yes, it is.
I was wondering if you'd show.
I didn't come this far to back out now.
I wasn't ruling it out.
every day that money sits there, just out of reach.
comes a point where you finish the job or it finishes you.
you get caught, you lose everything.
already lost everything. When I ran, I ran fast. Didn't look back.
So...How's this gonna work?
on your go, the ingenieur Minard will provide you and your cargo safe and discrete passage to the island of Santo Antao.
all the documentation you may need upon arrival is in that envelope - I.D.passport, everything.
getting in isn't my concern. It's getting out.
four steps.
step one, we move your money here by truck.
step two, my inside manat the gate, Mr.Ryan in customs, looks the other way while we transport you and your cargo to the vessel.
step four, Mr. Ryan files faux routing papers.
anyone comes looking for you, they'll start their search in Calais, France, 4,000 miles from your actual location.
not bad. But you skipped step three.
step three is the reason you hired me.
handle your end. Trust me to handle mine.
Caffrey's pretty planning an escape.
Yeah. Until Lawrence makes his move, he knows we'll keep his anklet off.
you're gonna let him walk around unmonitored?
no.
you are to check in every two hours on the hour.
you go from home to the office, and that's it. - I know the drill.
you're not off anklet for good behavior.
after Lawrence gets you to his money, take him to the harbor.
we've been over this. Anything else?
Yeah. What's step three?
step three is you arrest him.
good thing you didn't tell him.
I thought you might like that.
heard you talked to El.
look, Peter, whatever you think I have done, you and me hey. We're on the same team.
Really?
Yes.
may I?
Yes. Get out! - Thank you.
talk to you in two hours. - And two hours after that.
that's what I like to hear.
Hey, Moz. Our hunch may be correct.
Mrs.Suit is chatting up her old boss at the Dearmitt gallery.
what' d she say?
Oh, what a spring we're having.
blah blah blah.
Oh, she's asking him about a lab test.
Oh! S-she's giving him a scrap of burnt painting.
is it mine?
Oh, sweet Elvis Costello! It's your Chrysler painting!
it didn't burn.
flame is a fickle mistress.
we're gonna have to steal it.
no. No, no, no, no.
Peter will suspect me.
let them run the tests. We'll swap it out.
risky but not impossible.
we need a swatch of canvas and some paints from the 1930s. Which we have in great supply.
all right. Meet me at the warehouse. I'm on my way.
where are you?
I've got a tail.
What?! - Have you started?
of course I started, but without you here,
I'm not sure which colors to sample, so this whole thing might bean exercise in futility.
just pull the primaries. I can mix the rest.
I'm not an idiot.
I scraped a titanium white from the Rembrandt, a midnight blue from a Vlaminck.
Oh, you should get a monestial blue.
you know, I should get a monestial blue.
if you find one thick enough, feel free to let me know.
Oh, that's right -You're not here!
breathe, Moz.
how are we doing on the canvas? Did you check the Dal?
Evidently...Our friend Salvador liked to stretch time but not canvases.
I'll find something.
I know you will.
practicing?
Yeah, I figured I should have a copy of the Chrysler lying around in case Peter came looking for it.
you get everything?
some canvas and a spectrum of prewar paint that would pass any wood's light or I.R. Spectroscopy they want to throw at it.
the red is from a portrait of Fernande Olivier.
the last person to mix this paint was Picasso.
we're taking from masters.
Oh, Picasso was a communist. He'd be happy to share.
what's the plan for the gallery?
the plan for the gallery.
I pried some information from a loose-lipped gallerist.
they're sending our swatch out to an authentication lab at 11: 00 a.m. Tomorrow morning.
the gallery opens at 10: 30, so we have 30 minutes to get inside, make the switch, then get out.
it's gonna be close. Security?
a standard Schlagel on the door, with surveillance cameras.
we'll need a distraction while I pick it.
I can't buy you that much time by myself.
how about a Kansas city mud slide?
you gonna work the jackhammer?
no.
let's run a Phoebe Cates.
who's the girl?
I don't think June would mind if we used her granddaughter.
well, she's pretty enough.
will she do it without asking questions?
I'm sure she's up for a little excitement.
Excellent!
Oh - now onto the bigger question.
how do you plan on losing your tail, outside evolution?
I'll take a page from Magritte.
Ah, you got to be kidding me.
did I win?
the contest -"wear a dark suit, fedora,"come to 23rd and 10th. Best-dressed wins 500 bucks.
Yeah. Yeah.
you won!
okay, Moz. You're up.
Hey, I have a delivery for a Thomas Johnson.
you just missed him.
Tom took a job in Boston. His last day was Monday.
Oh, damn. Can't blame him, though.
boston's a hell of a town.
something I can help you with?
no, I'm just admiring the view.
nice, huh?
Yeah.
look what I did. I got it all over me.
there is something very seriously wrong with me.
today of all days. Would you mind holding this?
Oh. Uh, sure.
and could you take this?
o - okay, but - And I'm gonna need you to hold this up for me.
Oh. Of course.
whoa, whoa, whoa! Miss! You can't take your top off here.
look, I don't think you get it.
I can't be late today, okay? My boss will kill me if I'm late.
C - come on, man. Let her change!
Yeah. I guess it couldn't hurt.
uh, just be quick about it, okay?
Thanks, guys, really.
you have no idea what this means to me.
Oh, or... Us.
which top do you like?
this or this?
uh, th-the second one.
you guys are wonderful.
Yeah, just a couple of working stuffs doing what we can to help out a lady in distress.
almost there.
perfect. We are good to go.
great.
you are a life saver.
you too.
screw Boston. This is a hell of a town.
Hey, Peter. You gave Jones a nice runaround.
that was Jones?
I thought that could've been Lawrence. I didn't want to blow my cover.
why'd you put Jones on me?
you really want me to answer that?
you at home? - Where else would I be?
what are you doing?
you know, arts and crafts - The usual.
jones will be at your place in 20 minutes.
he's gonna stay on you.
you're gonna let him.
no problem. - Bye.
so, I'm getting everything in place at the warehouse.
the plane is fueled and ready.
you know Jones is outside, right?
Yeah. Once I get Lawrence and his money to the docks, I can slip him again.
by the time Lawrence is being hauled downtown, we'll be sipping champagne at cruising altitude.
so, when's "go" time?
Lawrence' s text came in two minutes ago.
why didn't you tell me?
this is it!
we take our time. We do it right.
look, you know, everything good must one day come to an end.
just think -We're never gonna see anything in this apartment again
except you. You can come with me.
Hey. What are you doing?
I should say something to June.
Hey. You know the rules.
no goodbyes.
Yeah.
I'm gonna miss her, too.
I'm...gonna miss all of it.
come on.
I'll see you downstairs. - Okay.
goodbye, Caffrey.
lawrence made contact?
I'm on my way to the Fencing Club to meet him now.
update me when you have the money.
jones will back your play if anything goes wrong.
I'm heading to the harbor now.
all right.
everything in place?
only thing left is the money.
the Federal Reserve job - It was flawless.
probably the most secure vault in the world, and I walked out with $60 million.
it was Prometheus...Stealing fire from the Gods.
Prometheus got caught.
Yes, he did. Yes, he did.
and the FBI closed in - fast.
every account, P.O.Box, storage locker, friends, relatives, apartments. They were all over me.
I need to get out fast, stash the money.
I thought I'd be back in 48 hours to collect it, but the Feds were there, waiting.
instead, I was on a plane headed south of the border.
every morning, I'd check the news, waiting to hear the report - $60 million found in Gramercy Fencing Club.
it's here?
there are five ducts to this room.
I diverted air to two of them.
there it is - $60 million.
you know how many times I pictured this in my head?
is this how you thought it'd feel?
no.
better.
what's going on?
someone knows we're here.
agent Jones.
what are you doing here?
talk, or I shoot.
you tailing my friend here?
answer him.
were you following me?
I don't know who you are.
I'm on Lawrence.
how many your friends you got out there?
I followed a hunch.
I'm by myself.
they probably know about the dock.
the whole thing is blown.
kill him. Dump the body.
W - wait a second.
this guy is useless dead.
alive, he's leverage.
for what?
you forgot step three.
attaque compos? i.e. - Feint left, thrust right.
what are you talking about?
I'm talking about a backup plan.
when it all goes to hell, this is why you hire me.
I've got a plane.
now boarding - Freedom airlines, flight number one and only.
I'm here with the client.
we're putting step three into effect.
step three? Neal, what are you talking about?
the client and I are moving the cargo to the airstrip.
client? Don't tell me you're talking about Lawrence.
that's right.
no. No, no, no. Don't do this to us.
make sure it's gassed up and good to go.
all right?
grab your suit and meet me there.
what? No suits.
no suits on the island!
no sign of Caffrey and Lawrence.
still no answer from Jones.
this is taking way too long.
you better have a good reason for calling.
I'm in the middle of something very important, Mozzie.
Yeah, you and me both, suit.
I'm passing on a message from Neal.
he's made a request for our presence, without the slightest regard for the monumental inconvenience it causes us -Primarily, me.
van Buren airstrip.
30 minutes.
moving out.
Neal, we got to hurry.
I said,"suit,"not "costume."
don't worry. The suit got the message.
load the fed up front.
why aren't we flying?
you sure you can fly this thing?
get around the front of that plane.
team one, flank left. Team three, flank right. Box him in!
we cannot let Caffrey get airborne!
Lolana, it wasn't supposed to be like this.
get us out of here.
we're not gonna make it.
we don't have a choice, Moz.
we have to make it.
climb.
we need more speed.
climb now!
watch out!
come out now with your hands up!
let me see your hands!
we're secure!
lawrence is on the plane!
you okay? - I'm good.
you all right, Jones? - Yeah.
Caffrey had my back.
sorry... Amelia.
luckily, I was here to save the day once again.
you're a hero, Moz. I'll sew you a cape.
do that. I look good in aubergine.
thank you.
step three, huh?
the part where you arrest him.
nice work.
Thanks.
Ah, the anklet.
Hey, hon. Hey. Good day?
uh, we caught a bad guy, so it wasn't a bad day.
well.
this should make you feel even better.
authentication from the gallery.
the canvas is mid-1930s.
so, it wasn't Neal's painting.
well, unless he painted it 75 years ago.
Hi, Peter.
I let myself in.
Yeah. Yeah, you did.
just clearing out some space for storage.
you like that one?
Yeah.
you can have it.
I've already got the view.
I'm calling a truce.
I may have rushed to judgment.
Oh, you had judgment on speed dial.
I'm trying to be gracious.
you kept my severed tie.
I was pretty pissed off.
and now?
look at this. I'm smiling again.
I like it.
I got to go.
okay.
door's open anytime.
Thanks.
what do you have?
E.R.T.'s still doing a clean up of the warehouse and the U-boat burn.
they found this about an hour ago.
what is it?
part of the original German U-boat manifest.
we can make out 22 of the paintings that were on board.
who else knows about this?
uh, two people on the evidence recovery team, Jones, and me.
keep it that way.
we have to sell something.
Why?
well, our first escape was compromised.
we have to fund the second.
you still think Caffrey has the art?
I don't know.
he did have that get away plane ready awfully fast.
Yeah. Yeah. But you know what? That doesn't matter.
patience is our best asset right now.
whoever stole it, if a single item on this list shows up anywhere. We got 'em.
Yeah. We got 'em.
simple question
pick a card. Any card.
what does this have to do with our property-fraud scam?
you'll have the whole thing cracked before I can say "ta-da."
pick a deed.
now what?
now I take these 51 deeds and figure out which one you took.
it's not magic. It's math.
we go through the title company's records, match them with the realtor's, and figure out which one is missing.
Ta-da. - Nice work.
but here's another case we need to make disappear.
Selena Thomas. Who's she?
devoted serial monogamist who marries wealthy men right before they die.
a black widow. Could be.
she has four rich late husbands. - She gets around.
and now she's finally getting around to new york.
quite the queen of hearts.
cute. - You like that?
move it, copperfield.
their deaths are listed as natural
heart attack, embolism, skydiving accident.
what about the fourth guy?
we're waiting on the l. a. Bureau to send their report.
four husbands, four dead bodies.
we think she's killing them, but we don't know why.
they're not leaving her all their money?
Nope. That's what you'd expect.
but she's not collecting on any of the insurance payoffs.
we flagged her name on this.
it's an application for the manhattan millionaire society bachelors auction.
if she's gonna be at this auction, then so are we.
club has three open slots for eligible men.
that means I need three volunteers.
Neal, raise your hand. - Do I have to?
Yes. There's our first lucky bachelor.
come on. We'll create very irresistible identies for you guys.
Yeah, then hope she doesn't kill her latest boy toy before we find the money.
that's a hand. Jones is number two.
no, Peter, I didn't - One more.
come on. It's only a cover. Who's number three?
how aboutyou, Peter?
I mean, you seem like the marrying kind, right?
Iammarried.
hey... It's only a cover.
be nice to give her some variety.
unless - Guys, guys, unless, you know, you need permission.
I don't - I don't - No, I
o - okay, fine. I'll do it.
all right. Let's set it up.
are you scared to tell Elizabeth? - Terrified.
my role in the assignment's minimal.
right.
you're playing piece of meat number 2.
you're gonna flirt - Talk. I'm gonnatalkto them.
and then you're gonna walk across a stage while these women are bidding on you.
el, my chances of being picked are slim to none between neal and
wait. Hold on. Your chances arenotslim.
honey, look at you.
I'm holding poop.
and you look damn sexy doing it.
you know what? - What?
you're gonna win this thing. - I am?
Yeah. I'm gonna make sure of it. Come on.
what's the grand prize on this?
I get to take a very lovely, very dangerous woman out on a date.
hmm. It's nothing you can't handle.
thanks to you.
uh, we, actually, have never been on a date.
Peter and Elizabeth's house.
dinner date. Not date. - Define date.
one-on-one. - What about lunches?
lunch is not romantic. Lunch is lunch.
we've never been on a real date.
it's okay. What's your cover?
playboy son of a texas oil tycoon.
Oh, well! I like the accent.
I'm glad you do, ma'am.
there's gonna be a very big problem, though.
what's that?
all the women are gonna want you, so what happens when your killer gets outbid?
I see your point.
you're gonna have to throw your meetings with all the other women.
how do I do that?
well, we are very shallow creatures, but there are things that even beautiful men like you do that drive us nuts.
Oh, you're good.
all right, honey, let's go over this again. You are...
Peter Williams, U.S. Steel magnate.
Mm. And tell me more about the steel industry.
well, it began as a family business.
boring, boring, boring. By then - What did we discuss?
right. Uh, you don't want to hear about what I do.
I really want to know more about you.
and why are you still single?
haven't found the right woman yet.
who might this right woman be?
Oh, well, she's about 5'5," brunette, most beautiful blue eyes I've ever seen, smart as a whip, and gorgeous as hell.
Aww. Perfect. Okay.
remember, this is a conversation, not an interrogation, so you got to move away from the "where are you froms"
and "what do you do," and, honey, don't make that face.
what face? - That face. oh. Right. Yes.
be yourself. You're gonna be great. - Okay.
Thanks, honey. - bye.
see ya.
Oh. Have we, uh, met?
I don't believe we have. Arthur fort, pastry baron to a multimillion-dollar dessert empire.
ladies love the sweets.
you ready? Are you?
gentlemen, we are about to begin.
I will make the announcement, and when I give you the go-ahead, you just take your places on the stairs, okay? Good luck.
okay, ladies, I have only one question for you!
are you ready to meet your men?
why do I feel like I need a pike and sword?
for those about to date... We salute you.
okay, ladies, you'll have five minutes to talk to each man.
when the bell sounds... ...you simply move on to the next.
now, why don't you go ahead and check your invitations for the proper rotation.
you ever done anything like this before?
Yes.
what doyoulook for?
tall, dark, and handsome is fine with me.
you can also tell a lot about a man by his smile, how confident or counterfeit he can be.
so what's your plan?
I'm gonna bomb every meeting except Selena.
Mm. You're afraid you'll cause a frenzy.
I'm narrowing the odds.
what's your approach? - I'm going for the frenzy.
I'm gonna try to charm every one of them.
I want good word of mouth. - Sure.
I'm gonna maintain eye contact and remember it's a conversation, not an interrogation.
that's all good, but what you want to do, you want to keep it up here when you talk, right?
down here, this is all second-date territory.
okay, so be yourself. Just be yourself up here.
and if you're holding a drink, keep it in your left hand.
that way, when you shake her hand with your right, your first touch won't be cold.
Yeah, itiscold.
one final reminder
some of the men have been known to propose on the very night of the auction, so, please, don't forget to check their pockets for engagement rings.
okay, millionaires, the moment all these beautiful ladies have been waiting for.
on your marks, get set... Date!
Hi.
where were you before new york?
Cleveland.
fascinating.
tell me more about cleveland.
I - it's in Ohio.
Oh! - oh!
I made my first batch of chocolate-chip cookies when I was 5 years old.
I've never looked back.
you seem passionate about pastry.
I'm passionate in everything I do.
nothing compares to it.
hunting deer? - Fawns, actually - The babies.
are you serious? - Yeah, there's a certain thrill in the kill.
and - Oh. Oh, one second.
what are you doing? - Oh, ho.
Hey, buddy! What's up?
hold on. I'm on a date. Say hi.
and switch.
how are you?
Oh, I want to hear more about you.
okay, um, well - Oh, it's gonna be cold.
it's cold, isn't it?
so, I spoke with Selena. Didn't get much.
she likes tall, dark, and handsome.
well, how dark are we talking?
excuse me. - One more minute. One more minute.
I'm looking for that - The right person.
and what does she look like?
Hi. How are you?
Ah, tsh, tsh, tsh! Just one more minute. I'm just checking the mavericks
they're losing again. It's not good.
she's looking for someone she can manipulate, someone who comes across as sincere but less than self-assured.
how am I doing?
you're great. - Yeah.
basically, she wants someone with an honest smile.
a smile.
the "honest" part went right by you, huh?
pleased to meet you, miss...
Oh, call me Selena. - Selena.
I've got to admit, you caught my eye the minute I came down the stairs.
that is a lovely dress.
Oh, thank you. Girl has to make an impression, right?
Oh, you do.
tell me a little about yourself.
well, fortunately, I've done well
well enough to devote the majority of my time to a few nonprofits.
are you... into nonprofiting?
well, with the right person, always.
yeah? That's nice.
and switch.
well, uh, I hope we get to continue this conversation another time.
Yeah, me too.
all right. It was a little too fast.
it was lovely to meet you. - Great to meet you.
Hi. - hi.
I'm Peter. - Hi, Peter.
you're very beautiful. - Aw, thank you.
so, why are you here, Peter?
to find someone special.
but most of these women are only interested in small talk, so...
well, what are you interested in?
being caught off guard.
having a conversation that - That goes beyond the "what do you do?" and "where are you from?"
Selena, there are a lot of nice guys here.
I truly hope you find the one you're waiting for.
sold for $8, 000! Congratulations.
next up is Mr. Arthur fort, the pastry baron of brooklyn.
shall we start the bidding at $5, 000?
he seemed nice. - He was charming.
But? - A littletoocharming.
sold for $11, 000.
our next bachelor is Mr. Nicholas munroe.
Nick has been making the rounds, but now he's ready to take you ladies on the date of your lives.
shall we start the bidding at $5, 000? Do I hear $5, 000?
he's gorgeous. - He's young.
well, you can get him at a discount.

well... Okay, sold!
what happened? - My plan worked. Too well.
our next bachelor is Mr. Peter Williams.
we'll start the bidding at - $15, 000.
Wow! Any other bids?
sold for $15, 000 to the woman in red!
Okay,$15, 000 has to be the record.
no. Here you go, tex.
but it was the second-highest bid they've ever had.
second? - There was a Kennedy last year.
was it one of the good-looking ones?
eh... Guys, let's talk about what's next.
okay. Where are you taking her?
nowhere. I'm gonna go to her place, drop a bug, plant a keylogger, and figure out what she has planned.
and how she plans to murder you.
that, and how she's angling for my money.
is this date gonna be dangerous?
whoa. Peter is not dating her.
I'm occupying her. I'll have an arrest warrant before dessert.
this is Peter.
Hey, Peter. It's Selena.
Hey! Great to hear from you.
we still on for tonight?
we have reservations for 8: 00 p. m. at the Griffin.
it's downtown. It's delicious.
it's... I'll pick you up at 7: 00?
no. I'll meet you there.
no, no, no. I - it's no trouble.
no. The trouble is you disagreeing with me.
well, what kind of gentleman would I be if I didn't pick you up on our first date?
Peter, i'll see you at 8: 00.
see you at 8: 00.
no trace.
Ugh! Great! We don't know where she is!
if I can't pick her up... You'll have to drop her off.
you're gonna have to seal the deal.
no - no, no! No deal sealing.
you don't want her dumping you and going after another victim.
Diana's right.
you need to impress her enough that she wants to take you home.
Elizabeth got me into this.
Yes, she did.
so, technically, it's okay.
Yeah. - Okay.
I'm gonna close the deal.
I'm on point. Target's not here.
relax, commando. It is just a dinner.
I got eyes on Selena. She'll be inside within a minute.
target sighted.
you look even more handsome tonight, if that's possible.
so do you. Beautiful.
shall we?
Yes.
wonder what's on the menu.
theirs? Or ours?
ours.
it's a very nice halibut with a mango chutney.
why are you doing this?
you helped me save face at the auction.
the least I can do is offer you a decent meal.
a candle!
electric.
something to drink? Please.
may I recommend our merlot?
a bottle of your vino del diablo.
how adventurous.
I'll take a risk once in a while.
like the auction. Like you.
Oh, so I'm a risk?
I feel I don't need to hide anything from you.
maybe that was a little too forward.
no, Peter.
there's nothing more attractive than the truth.
he's doing good.
well, he's gonna need to step it up if he wants an invite back to her place.
you ever cook like this for sara?
I thought about it. - Well, do more than think.
insurance investigator barbie would be thoroughly impressed.
Oh, I love this song.
Oh, me too.
shall we dance? - Oh, uh...
you've been adventurous with the merlot. Why stop now?
is that a tango?
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Peter, Peter, there are certain things you cannot recover from.
I can handle this.
I don't hear any screaming.
let's go back to my apartment so that
whoa, whoa, whoa.
did you get that? - The first part loud and clear.
the second? - Never to be repeated.
nice work, agent burke.
remind me to thank el for the dance lessons.
I don't think he can hear us.
she must have blown the receiver.
why don't you make us a drink while I change and put on some music?
is she actually slipping into something more comfortable?
I don't like this woman.
Hey, Jones. What's up?
come on, Peter. Plant the bug and get out.
if you can hear me, I don't see a computer, so the keylogger isn't gonna work.
I'm going for the bug plant on the purse.
Thanks, Jones. L.A.'s autopsy came in.
Selena's fourth victim dead of a stab wound to the throat.
street mugging.
Selena was the only eyewitness, and they never caught the assailant.
well, that's convenient.
the murder happened while they were out to dinner.
maybe sheis a serial killer.
or he caught on to her plan.
what are you doing?
thought I saw a bug.
I'll call the exterminator in the morning.
how about those drinks?
lemon?
surprise me.
Peter? - yes.
Oh! Oh! Oh, oh, I just spilled it on me.
Oh! Oh, I'm so clumsy.
he needs help. - All right, i'm gonna call him.
can you generate some sound effects?
a steel mill, people yelling, something.
the bureau can, and I can patch it through to the call.
you mind if I use your bathroom?
Oh, no, I can help you with that.
Oh, no, no. That's okay. I - These buttons are difficult.
let me - Uh, here, let me get the - Oh, oh... No, no - I can get it. That's not a problem.
Peter Williams' phone.
Where's Mr. Williams?
who is this?
you know what? It doesn't matter. We need him here, pronto.
Hamilton mill is getting lit up like a christmas tree.
we have an induction furnace that is ready to blow.
sounds important.
this is Williams.
Hello, Mr. Williams.
I'm looking for Phil - Phil landerer.
right. - You know him?
okay, on my way.
we're good.
sorry. I got to handle this.
I know it. I know. Selena, I had a great time.
I'll make it up to you.
Oh, you'll make it up to me tomorrow night.
gotta go. - Yeah.
Selena made a call after you left.
I'm pulling up the audio now. Hang on.
it's me. He left early, but I think I got to him.
did you spook him? - Not at all.
I'll have Williams down on one knee by the end of the week.
after that, you finish the job, and it's payday.
she has a partner.
whoever her partner is, they probably run the endgame.
you're gonna have to keep seeing her.
is there another option? Anyone?
I'm sure Elizabeth will be completely... supportive.
we'll find out when we talk to her.
we? - Yes, we.
Oh, come on.
why do you have to see heragain?
we've run into some... complications, but - Elizabeth, this - this woman is a murder.
another reason I don't love this!
she needs to be taken out.
down. Down.
she needs to be taken down.
el, I want this over with more than anyone.
is she... attractive?
not really. - Define "attractive.
you know, I'm gonna
I'm gonna take satchmo for a walk, get a little air.
Bye. - See ya, honey.
that wasn't a complete train wreck.
but that's as far as it goes.
you're seeing Selena again tonight. What's your plan?
well, I'm gonna try to get to her cellphone and find out who she's talking with.
the sooner this ends, the better.
then propose. - Right. What?
well, you said you want to speed things up, right? - Yeah.
nothing says "enamored" like - Polygamy?
marry me. - no!
no, the cell is a good start.
all right, it's your operation.
and I'm not changing it.
Diana has already prepped the team.
she's following me in the van.
sounds like you got it covered. Do you mind if I take off?
where you going?
Sara's coming to my place.
you're not the only one with dinner plans.
Hey. - Hey, I got your message.
is everything okay?
I don't know.
you tell me.
you're trying to impress me.
well, look, I know you said I didn't have to, but...
whatever makes you feel better.
Wow. Look at you.
no purse? - no.
I was in the mood for something a little more private tonight.
let's go to your place.
my place?
sure. Sounds good.
Oh, it will be.
Neal, change of plans.
you have 15 minutes to clear out of your apartment, or my cover's blown.
I'm commandeering your date.
it's very lovely for a first date.
don't expect this every time.
Oh, there's gonna be a second date?
guy can hope. - Yeah?
Yeah. I could be talked into it.
Neal, go check your phone.
thank you. - yep.
who is it?
we got to get out of here right now.
Peter's undercover. He's coming up the stairs.
I'll explain everything later.
no, no! Not that way! The closet.
uh, new bottle.
through there.
I got it, I got it.
sorry.
Ooh, grab me a quiche.
just let me make sure we're all set.
here we are.
amazing!
Oh, Peter, you shouldn't have.
surprise. - What is going on?
remember that case I was working on?
the killer bride? - Yeah. Peter's dating her now.
Really? - yep.
so what arewedoing?
this apartment was a backroom speakeasy.
and this was the observation room.
Oh, wow.
very eclectic, right?
Peter, you didn't tell me that you were an artist.
I dabble. I wouldn't say I'm any good, though.
Oh, don't be modest.
you know, this may sound silly, but...
...would you draw me?
Oh, I'm sure that we could have...
you mean right now? - Yeah. Why not?
I - it would take time to do it right.
we have all night.
it wouldn't do you justice.
Oh, but you will. I won't take no for an answer.
okay. But, uh... You should know that
I'm experimenting with some very, very primitive styles.
Yeah.
CanPeter draw?
unless she's expecting a breathtaking stick figure, he's in trouble.
Uh-huh. Does he know thatyou'rehere?
unfortunately, yes, he knows about this room.
all right.
let me make sure the light is right.
okay. All right. Hold this.
this is not how I saw the night going, by the way.
I mean, any guy can make a girl dinner.
Onlyyoucould sketch a black widow from a hidden back room.
is the pose okay?
Yes. That's perfect.
okay. - But, rember- No peeking.
Peter, I have to ask, how did you... Set this... All up so fast?
Hey, do yourself a favor.
never try to send a grappling hook through the post office.
I - I mean, that is, if... You ever needed to send a grappling hook, that is perfect timing.
this is my... Man - Haversham.
he made the arrangements. Haversham, everything is perfect.
thank you. You may enjoy your night off.
so sorry to interrupt... Such a suspiciously amorous evening.
Haversham, do you mind?
I'll need my suit for tomorrow.
a suit.
Yes. I'll be right back.
good. - How handy.
Yes, He's... one of a kind.
I should have known.
finished. It looks good.
something's missing.
Neal, are you sure you want to do that?
well, Peter said he wants this case closed fast. This should help.
okay, but Peter is gonna be really mad.
but she won't.
all right, moz, get this to him without her seeing.
Oh, sure. I'll hide it under my gargantuan clown sleeve.
Oh, come here. Try this.
Oh, I'm more of a spring.
Moz, we don't have time.
okay.
Oh. I got it. - Okay.
your turn coat for tomorrow, sir.
Ah, yes. Thank you. That is exactly what I needed.
good work, moz.
Oh, I'm gonna need some... Cash for the dry-cleaner.
of course. - $50 should do it.
don't know what I'd do without you.
Oh, I might need more.
good evening... - yes.
...Madam. - It's great to meet you... Haversham.
he's curious.
very high-functioning, considering his condition.
done.
Wow! That looks amazing!
Yeah, it is.
Peter, what's this?
Oh, that?
I wanted tonight to be special.
are you asking me what I think you're asking me?
Peter! Yes. Yes, yes.
best date ever.
she said yes?!
you could look at this as another victory for team burke.
eh, el, I'm putting my life at risk here.
Yes! You are.
I mean, this was - This was supposed to be a date, not a save the date.
the investigation's almost over.
Yeah, I recall hearing that after the first date. Now you're engaged?
all I need is to find out who her partner is.
that means contacts, figuring out who she's close to.
maybe you need a guest list.
guest list?
for the wedding.
you want to wrap up this case?
you need an event planner.
look at you two.
Peter, you didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
thank you.
mm, you're so welcome.
now, I was thinking of setting you guys up by the gazebo.
that sounds great. - Yeah.
I'll need a head count to make sure we have enough room.
did you bring your lists?
Selena, friends and family?
Oh, no. I'm new to the city. I don't know many people here.
Plus, I have all the family I need in this man.
I understand. You want to keep it small.
weddings can be so chaotic. In the end, you're making a schedule instead of a-a memory.
sounds like you've had experience.
you know, my husband and I wanted to keep it small, but somehow our wedding ballooned into this massive event.
you didn't enjoy it?
Oh, it was lovely. It was really lovely.
but I think if I were to do it again, I'd keep it a little more intimate, simple. Just us.
well, hopefully, ours will be more special.
we... Have to get going.
we have reservations for lunch in a half-hour.
Oh, Peter, do you mind if I borrow Selena for just a moment?
I wouldloveto go over invitations with her.
sure. I'll go get the car.
okay. Thanks, honey.
now that we're alone, I wanted to ask you something, and I didn't want to do it in front of your fianc?
have you been married before?
I have.
how many times? - What business is that of yours?
Oh, I was just asking to make sure that you have all the proper legal documents for the marriage license.
that way, we can avoid a lot of questions.
great. I'll have my lawyer send over the papers.
okay. So, we'll be in touch.
thank you so much. - Okay.
ready? - Ready as you are.
did you, uh - did you get a look at the license plate?
uh, no tags.
all right, thank you very much. I got it from here.
thank you.
Wow. That car came out of nowhere.
Yeah. If she hadn't warned me, I
Oh, I don't want to think about that.
I - I don't know what I would do if anything happened to you.
and if something did?
how close was it?
close. Got my heart pumping.
but then Selena and I had one of those "should anything ever happen" chats.
that's a pretty good scam.
car nearly runs you down, which prompts a discussion about what happens when you're gone?
exactly.
she told me if worse comes to worse, she wouldn't want a dime of my money.
Really? - She'd prefer I leave it to charity.
one of her choosing?
I went through the wills of her victims.
each one left a significant contribution to a charitable organization.
I'm guessing these don't exist anymore.
no. - So where'd the money go?
this may tell us.
we got something from the legal papers Selena gave Elizabeth.
the lawyer's name was a bogus I.D.
we tracked to this guy. Look familiar?
it's the emcee from the auction. Gerald jameson.
Yeah, he hosts dating events worldwide.
never stays in one place for more than a year.
always changes the name and charity of his latest auction.
that's a great setup.
he puts on these auctions, lines up the suitors...
she knocks them down.
we need a concrete link between these two and the charities.
I'll talk to him. - What are you gonna say?
that my date didn't work out.
she was a nice girl who prefers... - Nice girls.
I was gonna say "blondes," but we can run with that, too.
should give us enough time to case the office.
who is "us"? Why'd I ask?
all right, we're looking for safes, vaults, and locked cabinets - Keep an eye out.
Hey, hey. Great to see you again.
well, I was just wondering about your next event.
I take it... Things didn't work out.
well, you know, some guys propose on the first date.
some don't make it to the second.
I see.
and with regards to your little friend over there, we have a - A certain height requirement.
Oh, no, no. He's, uh - He's all set with the ladies.
Really? - Oh, yeah.
well, I'm sorry to say my next event won't be for two months, and that's in Florida.
I love the sunshine state.
am I still tall enough to fill out an application, or...?
Yes, of course. I'll go get it from the back.
standard banks-smith security system, but it's gonna be hard to get in here with him hanging around.
then we will have to get to it later.
there you are. - Thank you so much.
one more thing. I love this space.
do - do you love it?
Yeah. High ceilings!
do you rent it out?
Yes, it is possible.
my friend, Mr. Williams
uh, we attended your last auction together
of course, yes. He's our big winner.
Yes, he had better luck than I did.
and he asked me to help him with a... Certain celebration.
welcome to your bachelor party!
can't believe you did this.
Oh, you're welcome. - Not what I meant.
come on.
now we have the entire night to get into Jameson's office.
the Harvard crew is all over the place for backup.
this is business. It is not pleasure.
what ishedoing here?
I love national geographic.
the mating habits of midlevel government employees - Totally captivating.
well, I'm not on duty. I'm going to get a drink.
this anything like your first one?
no.
all right, i'll distract. You get in the records room.
got anything?
no.
I'm gonna get a drink.
nothing. - Great.
I don't know who's gonna kill me first - My wife or my fianc? e.
what if I told you there's a way to spook your lady into leading us straight to the money?
how? - Use what we got.
Neal, what we've got are strobe lights, probies, women, and booze.
exactly.
have a probie grab a camera from the surveillance truck.
we're taking shots.
Mr. Jameson! Come on, join us for a drink.
Oh, no. No, I really need to keep an eye on the space.
Oh, come on. I owe you one. - Weowe you one.
Yes, none of us would be here if it wasn't for you.
well, if you put it that way, I guess one little drink wouldn't hurt.
all right.
gentlemen, cheers.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Congratulations.
Aah! That burns!
delicious. Thank you. You guys have fun.
no, no, no, no. Hold on. - Bartender, another round?
no, no. No, really. - Come on. I disagree.
this is my best friend's bachelor party.
let's make it... A night to rember.
Congrats. - Thanks.
have a wonderful life.
okay! Oh, god!
Yeah, that's delicious. - Yeah, it is.
one more. No, top shelf. - And cheers again. And cheers again
Aah! Ha!
you know, it does go down easy.
four, five, six times... You can barely taste it.
you beat us on that one!
much happiness.
Cheers. Cheers. - Thank you.
what are you doing here?
miss Thomas?
what can you tell me about this man?
you're FBI? - I was undercover at Mr. Jameson's last fundraiser.
we believe he had illicit financial dealings prior to his death.
his death? What happened?
we're waiting on the toxicology report.
I'm here because I need to question everyone affiliated with the society house's recent auction.
I'm sorry.
this is a shock, but I don't know anything.
looks like diana got to her.
she's heading towards the bank.
she'll be clearing out the money any minute now.
good. Give jameson his wake-up call.
Peter, you're on standby.
Hey!
I got a ping from the bank. Why did you drain our account?
wait a minute. They told me you were dead.
what? Who told you I was dead?
we did.
wait a minute. What's going on?
you two are under arrest.
wait a minute. You're FBI, too?
Yeah, let's just say i'm the adventurous type.
uh, speaking of, I think we wereall a little adventurous last night.
further incriminating evidence.
should we give him a little slide show here? - yeah. Yeah.
here's you on shot number eight, having a good time.
here's you on shot number 12 having a great time.
this is when you told us you had a big payday coming up.
great. Good job.
and that's when you told me I should enjoy the honeymoon phase while I can.
Oh, here's where you said you were tired and wanted to go to bed.
something about having to tie up loose ends in the morning.
they say that alcohol's a truth serum for some people.
you are definitely one of them, my friend.
and, in case you were wondering, we got it all on tape.
I actually thought we had something.
it wasn't real.
not even our tango?
you know, they say that breaking up is tough.
for what it's worth, it wasn't me.
it was you.
that's a shame.
would have been a nice wedding. - Yeah.
Elizabeth ordered most of the arrangements already.
I'm sure she did a great job.
it's too bad we'll have to ship them all back.
or ship them somewhere else.
is everything okay?
Peter needs your help right away.
okay.
honey?
Hey, beautiful.
what is this?
I'm sorry for what you went through on this one.
so, to make it up to you, I'm giving you the wedding you always wanted.
small, simple. Just us.
will you marry me again?
Yes. As many times as you ask.
preacher's here. - That was fast.
sorry I'm late.
don't tell me he's been ordained.
twice. Tax dodge?
Oh, yeah, like I pay taxes.
will you bear witness?
of course.
dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of... suit
to our best and final score.
what is it?
part of the original German u-boat manifest.
you still think Caffrey has the art?
I don't know.
agent Kramer is sorry he can't be here in person, but he briefed me fully.
he did? - Chris Gates.
you're interpol? - Yeah.
so it's a partial list. Most of what was on the sub is still unaccounted for.
they only found one page.
if anyone tries to sell anything that's on that list, we're gonna nail 'em.
Yes, we are.
did you find the safe?
the manifest wasn't in there, Moz. I'm sorry.
it's open season on Keller. Spoils go to the victor.
a $6-million bounty.
that's roughly the black-market sale price of the Degas.
no. That's the exact sale price of the Degas.
it's on the list, Moz!
you lied to me?
when the Degas turns up - And it will
the FBI is gonna know the treasure didn't burn, and we are the prime suspects.
the sparrow dies at midnight.
then I'd hate to be the sparrow.
Seriously?
I was about to expose the leader of the North American Union.
Nope. You just thought you were.
the N. A. U. doesn't exist.
says you. You set this up?
I had to talk to you somehow.
another piece of fiction.
much like the yarn you spun about not having the FBI's art manifest.
you have a right to be angry. I lied to you.
Why? - I broke into Peter's safe.
I had the list in my hand. I was ready to take the treasure and go.
then why didn't you?
Peter cal - I have a life here.
but we had a dream.
well, dreams change.
I mean, have you ever thought we might not like whiling away our days on a Mediterranean island?
then we sell our island and come back.
no, you can come back. I can't.
I run on this, and New York is just a memory for me.
come on, Neal.
this was the one - The perfect last score.
I knew you were dragging your feet.
you went behind my back and fenced the Degas.
I did it to - I did it to protect us.
by putting a hit on Keller?
doing something that rash is exactly what will get us into trouble.
most black-market pieces never resurface. You know that.
because they're not on a list that Peter is actively looking for. The Degas is.
if Peter finds it - Yeah, I know.
and it proves that the treasure didn't burn, and the trail leads straight back to us.
so let's stop the bleeding.
who's the fence?
rusty? Seriously?
all right, talk to him.
find out who he sold the painting to. We'll start there.
fine.
talk to Rusty, okay?
but that does leave one question.
do you want to stay?
I'll let you know.
the greatest way to live honorably is tobe what we pretend to be.
I'm paraphrasing, but I don't think old Socrates here would mind.
he might.
can I help you? - Yeah.
you know anything about Renaissance portrait medals?
you seem to know that I do.
I have a cold case on a Fiorentino that was taken from the Smith Sonian 8 years ago.
the one I found turned out to be chocolate, wrapped in foil.
you probably heard that story.
sounds vaguely familiar.
I thought it might.
I'm - Agent Kramer, head of the bureau's D. C. Art crimes unit.
I'd say this moment was inevitable, Mr. Caffrey, given I am who I am, and you are who you are.
Oh, good. You two have met.
Oh, Neal and I were, uh... Well, what were we doing here?
shooting the breeze. - Yeah.
Yeah, you could say that.
agent Kramer was my mentor at Quantico.
now I'm just a friend.
so you're the one who taught Peter everything he knows.
well, I taught him a fair amount.
kept a few things for myself.
Oh, now, you didn't tell me that.
what brings D. C. to New York?
you tell him?
why don't we take this into the conference room?
all right.
two days ago, we got a tip that a long-lost masterpiece surfaced in New York.
you all know Agent Kramer from D. C.
one of our c. i.s heard chatter of a black-market painting being sold here.
a Degas.
good eye, Jones.
this one's called "Entrance of the masked dancers."
it was compl - Oh, Neal, I'm sure you can take it from here.
Oh, completed in 1884, it's one of Degas' seminal works.
it's more complex than the gauzy "Ballerinas" he's famous for.
it's believed to have been taken by the Germans in '41 from the Tsarskoye Selo Museum in Saint Petersburg, along with a whole lot of other art.
it hasn't been seen since.
what do you think, Neal?
me? I think recovering this masterpiece would be incredible, Sir.
me too. So we're gonna find it.
Hey, Moz, did you talk to Rusty?
I left word. He hasn't returned.
relax. He goes up to the Poconos. - The FBI knows about the Degas.
our degas? - Well, as much as it ever was.
we have to find Rusty, make sure he keeps our names out of this.
Oh, the hypothetical becomes the reality.
well, how's this for reality?
agent Kramer is in town from D. C. lending Peter a hand.
Really? What's the eminence grise of the art crimes unit like?
take Peter, add years of experience and less inclination to cut us slack.
my blood just ran cold.
supposedly he has an encyclopedic knowledge of the impressionists.
well, he knows enough about our Degas to scare the hell out of me.
please tell me he didn't bring his girl Friday with him.
no, we caught a break. Agent Matthews isn't with him.
a break, indeed. I don't know how you would have gotten out of that.
well, let's focus on getting out of this.
we need to stop Peter from finding that painting.
what do you have in mind?
locate the Degas and get it back. Why is there a giant hourglass on my table?
somewhere along the line, I think your motives got blurred.
keeping the treasure here was never part of the long-term plan.
Moz, this is not - 48 hours.
in that time, I will do anything you think we need to do in order to leave.
and when time runs out?
Lolana and I are taking the treasure and leaving...
regardless of the list, the Degas, or the FBI,
I hope you'll come with us.
you're giving me an ultimatum. - Yes, I am.
stay here with Peter or come with me.
choose a side, Neal.
Yeah, that was an interesting one.
we pulled the wire con on a mob boss.
another average day in the New York white collar office.
don't laugh. It's not far off.
what happened to the stoic, no-nonsense probie we called the archeologist?
the archeologist? - Yeah, he'd never stop digging.
I'm still stoic.
well, Neal's loosened you up a little bit. - Not true.
I can see that. - But in a good way.
Hey, our closure rate is unprecedented.
they know about you boys in D. C.
lot of water-cooler talk about Gotham city's finest cop and robber.
you took this right here in the kitchen.
Yeah. Yeah.
Neal is my C. I.and he's - Yeah, he's also a friend.
I'm - I'm - I'm gonna go put a pot of coffee on, and I'll let you guys talk, okay?
you're awful close to the guy you think stole the Degas.
it's that obvious?
well, today you had a roomful of people ready to go after that painting, and you looked at only one man. You think he stole the treasure?
I have my suspicions.
that's why you're here. I need an outside perspective.
Hey, before I met you, I had a C. I.
who used to throw batting practice for my son's little league team.
and now?
now I get the occasional e-mail from prison.
these are short-term relationships, Petey, at best.
it's hardwired in their brains.
you think once a con, always a con?
I think recidivism rates paint a bleak picture.
and you have to protect yourself when they fall.
I know. My career's at risk.
no, I'm not talking about your job. I'm talking about you.
when this happens, you're not slapping cuffs on a criminal.
you're taking down a friend.
it hurts.
people can change.
Pete... You asked me for my help.
if Neal is a suspect... - He is.
...then you have to treat him like one.
Neal, we need your expertise.
that's what I'm here for. - Great.
let's say that you're in possession of a masterpiece that disappeared 70 years ago.
like a Degas? - Exactly.
you can imagine that, right, Neal?
enjoying the fantasy as we speak, Sir.
too bad it can't last. - Why not?
because the painting's hot. You have to get rid of it.
or the feds will take me down? - Exactly.
you need to take that? - Nope.
so I've got a hot Degas I need to move before you take me down.
question is, how do you fence it?
I don't. I'd have someone fence it for me.
why go through a middleman?
a Degas appearing after all this time is going to be greeted with a healthy amount of skepticism.
people will assume it's a forgery.
Yeah, they usually are.
so I'd need someone with an impeccable reputation to make the sale. You want me to ask around?
actually, Kramer's team already has two suspects in mind.
thorough. - This is Gus Leland.
deals exclusively in French impressionists, recently returned to New York.
I know Gus.
he always has quality work. He definitely fits the bill.
second guy is known as Rusty.
renowned for an impeccable eye at spotting forgeries.
Yeah, he's suspected of brokering the black-market sale of Matisse's "la pastorale" last year.
Yeah. And it's also rumored he recently sold a high-priority painting here.
tell me, Neal, when you fence your Degas, who are you gonna use?
rusty's got the local contacts.
I'd go with Rusty.
then that's who we'll go after.
okay. My team has Gus.
good luck, gentlemen.
all right, I'll call Mozzie. He keeps tabs on Gotham's black-market elite.
no need. We've had eyes on Rusty for 24 hours.
we know exactly where he is.
let's go.
let's walk.
don't we need a car to pick up Rusty?
I got a few in place.
need to reach out and touch someone?
I find it a handy tool to keep abreast in this fast-paced world.
no one ever talks anymore. Put that away.
let's talk. - Okay.
tell me why Kramer's really here.
he's a friend and he's a mentor. - He's a watchdog.
is that what you think a mentor is?
let's see - as depicted in Homer's "Odyssey," mentor was half-man, half-god.
he represented the union of path and goal, if I recall.
wisdom personified. - That's one interpretation.
mentor also guided Odysseus' son during the Trojan War.
you planning to go to war, Peter?
Oh, not yet.
but if I have to, Kramer's got my back.
must be nice having someone who believes in you.
I never gave him a reason not to.
what's this about? You already have a new piece to sell?
you asked to meet in plain sight.
could you pick somewhere more public? And your hair's like a freaking flare.
this is genetics. That shirt is a choice.
why are we here?
this is about the last piece I sold. Where is it?
questioning my professional discretion? I'm insulted.
rusty, I need it back.
well, that's a different conversation.
I can talk to the guy, see if he'd be willing to part with it for, say, a 30% profit?
this is an emergency.
do you know how this works?
I'm a middleman. I give you the name, you cut me out the next time.
my entire job is dependent on me not telling you that information.
the FBI is looking for that painting.
now you're trying to scare me into helping you? Sad.
not sad.
urgent! The feds are here!
really, Mozzie?
going with the old, tired "g-men are after me" bit?
rusty, stay where you are! Rusty!
Diana, tell backup to come around to Bryant Park.
Hey, look out!
all right, I'll take left, you take right? Peter?
go.
Hey!
such a hurry!
Hey. - Why'd you bring the suit?
look, the FBI has been monitoring Rusty.
Peter didn't give me a chance to warn you. Did you get the info?
rusty didn't tell me anything.
on the upside, I'm assuming he won't tell the FBI, either.
all right, good. I'll head him off.
what? No! Let him go!
Peter is gunning for me, Moz.
if I help him catch Rusty, maybe he'll ease up on his leash. Now get out of here before he sees you.
hold on. Rusty's phone.
I deleted any references to us.
perfect. Thank you, Moz.
Diana, where are my guys?
this exit's closed.
rusty... We need to talk about a man and a Degas.
got to love good old-fashioned teamwork.
he screamed for his lawyer the second I put cuffs on him.
he knows talking will kill his reputation. We need leverage.
you have it. Found Rusty's phone.
he must have tossed it.
his recent call list should help us figure out where he got the Degas.
we'll get this to E. R. T.
meet you back at the office. We'll go over details.
sounds good.
your boy is very helpful for our lead suspect.
so it seems.
excuse me! Hold the elevator please!
thank you.
agent Matthews.
please. You can call me Melissa after last time.
sorry. Melissa. How are you?
I'm good. - Good.
I didn't know they'd pulled in interpol for this.
well, here I am.
on your way to see Agent Burke?
Yes. yes. - We'll go together.
fan... Tastic.
I assume you're here about the Degas?
I only know what Kramer tells me.
can I trust you? - What's wrong?
Melissa... Can I trust you? - Try me.
what I am about to say... Damn it. You're not authorized.
authorized for what? - It doesn't matter. There's no time.
there is a mole in the White Collar Division here in New York.
what?
we intercepted an unidentified transmission from this office.
someone here is trying to make a play for the sub's stolen art.
and they've sent interpol in to investigate?
Yes. I'm on special assignment.
no one here can be trusted. As far as this office is concerned, I'm a recovery consultant on loan to the bureau.
but the night we had drinks - I was careless, all right?
I let my cover slip. I'm sorry I got you mixed up in this.
Chris - Call me "Neal."Please.
I definitely don't regret the drinks, though.
agent Matthews. Thanks for making the trip.
of course. That's the job.
I have everything that Agent Kramer requested.
great. I see you've met Neal.
Yeah.
Yes, Neal and I had a very interesting conversation on the ride up.
he's always good for that.
you were right. The numbers on Rusty's cell gave us a lead.
glad I could help.
agent Kramer's in the conference room. Come on up.
I owe you another Martini.
it looks like Rusty deleted several numbers from his phone before Neal found it.
unfortunately, we don't know who he bought the Degas from.
but if we find it, we'll have leverage to make him tell us where he got it.
Yep.
the good news is, we think we know who he sold it to.
there were several calls placed to this man.
that's Elliott Richmond. He's a black-market arms trafficker.
rumor is he made a fortune moving M240s.
a fortune he spends on art.
he's got a soft spot for impressionists.
art is currency for guys like this.
over the past decade, a majority of black-market dealers stopped trading in cash.
too easy to trace, too unwieldy.
instead of carrying duffel bags with millions in bank notes,
it's easier to trade a single piece of art worth the same amount.
Neal, rumor is you've had some experience in this payment process.
well, details are sensitive, but the thief in mind allegedly traded a Manet for a batch of stolen identies.
it was a tough assignment.
assignment?
Yeah, the Wesley Godfrey cover was blown. What's our angle on Richmond?
Richmond keeps a penthouse at 75 Wall.
he doesn't own any other property in the city, and he loves to look at his art, so it's a good bet this is where he's keeping the Degas.
we've already set up a buy with him. Melissa, if you'd be so kind.
two years ago, I recovered this while working a case in Germany.
Whoa!
this is an MP5K modified to shoot through a briefcase.
very rare. Civilians can't get their hands on them.
we've told Richmond that if he likes what he sees, I can get him a couple hundred.
that should be enough to negotiate for a degas.
you're going in?
I'm gonna pose as the seller, and Diana will be my backup.
you hate guns, and as we can all see, Diana...
kind of love 'em.
so I'm sitting this one out?
not exactly. You'll be in the van... With me.
HK mp5 in a briefcase. Classic.
trigger's in the handle.
it'll fire through the briefcase shell while you're walking.
very nice. How many have you got?
two gross, but this will cost you. It's a rare item.
Oh, I understand that.
what I don't understand is what she's doing here.
she assists me.
can't the lady speak for herself?
the lady is also his muscle.
you're funny. - Let's talk.
agent Berrigan seems impressive.
almost as impressive as Peter.
if there's one sure thing about Peter, he accomplishes what he puts his mind to.
if he's got a target, he'll keep pursuing till he hits it... Dead-center.
I'll tell you what - You bring me a gross, and you've got yourself a deal.
done. But I don't do cash or check.
neither do I.
I have got a recently acquired and very valuable item that is worthy of these guns
financially speaking, of course.
what kind of item? - What happened?
maybe Peter doesn't consider you as much of a partner as you think.
tomorrow. 1: 00 sharp.
you bring the guns. I'll bring the item.
until tomorrow.
must be hard to do your job when you're kept out of the loop.
you seem to know something about that, huh?
Hey. - hey.
what happened today?
your watch cut out.
equipment malfunctions. It happens.
you know that better than anyone.
so you're not gonna tell me everything, huh?
it happens. If you don't like where they go, too bad.
that's Kramer talking.
he's the devil on your shoulder.
no. He's reminding me why I'm here.
I'm helping this investigation.
do you rember what you said to me the day I first accused you of stealing the art?
what was it, Neal?
prove it. - Be careful what you wish for.
then good luck.
Melissa. You dropped something.
I'll get it.
guess Kramer brought you in the loop after all, huh?
Thanks. - You're welcome.
why, yes, I do own these villas. What's that? The island?
Yeah. I kind of own that, too.
sure, I can show you coral reef... In my submersible.
we got a problem.
we should maybe copyright that phrase.
Peter put in an op order to search Richmond's home tomorrow at 1: 00.
we need to get there before the feds. Meet at my place tonight.
looking sharp, there, Mozzie.
Keller... Quelle surprise.
you're a hard man to track down.
you should know I always have an escape route.
five paces to my left is the "A" train.
to my right is Jerry, a noble hot-dog vendor who would gladly risk his life for mine.
looks to me there's only one major exit you're concerned with, given these fancy shirts, here. You almost killed me, Mozzie.
you put a price on my head.
which means all I have to do is scream and New York closes in to take you down.
you scream, I gut you like a carp, then hop the "A" train five paces to your left.
Jerry would never let you get that far.
you're bold, Mozzie. I'll give you that.
you make the kind of ruthless choices that Caffrey never would.
what do you want, Keller?
you know what I want.
I'm here as a courtesy...
which means this is your last chance to cut me in on your treasure.
even if I knew what you were talking about, the answer would still be no.
you're sure about that?
remember, I did ask nicely.
now I'm gonna have to make you give me what I want.
how?
why ruin the surprise? Enjoy.
you'd think that thing had sports scores on it.
I'm looking at Neal's tracking data.
is that what you've been doing for the last hour?
I need to know where he is.
honey, it's almost 10: 00 on a Monday. I don't think he's going anywhere.
Yeah, I can't be too sure... Not now.
all goes well, we'll recover the painting tomorrow.
then what?
then I'll know the truth.
Neal really did it, didn't he?
what's got you suddenly so convinced?
you.
the last time you obsessed this much, you caught him.
Hey. - We've got a problem.
you're right - We should copyright that phrase.
Keller's back. I don't think he's going anywhere.
what?
he's got the entire U. S. Government and half the criminal underworld looking for him.
exactly, and if he's sticking around, it means he's planning to do something big.
so we should split before that happens.
no, we worry about Keller after our Degas problem is handled.
I'm almost done with the forgery.
48 hours, Moz. Let's make them count.
you've already got a plan.
we'll have a 10-minute window during the FBI raid to swap the painting.
I'm sorry. I assumed you had a good plan.
with Peter on my back, this is the only way.
okay, then. Proceed.
all right, this is the layout for Richmond's apartment.
he's the penthouse, 43rd floor, accessible by two elevators and the fire stairs.
inside, Richmond's got a personal arsenal, so we have to tread carefully.
take him down quickly so he doesn't have a chance to grab a weapon.
Richmond thinks we're there to deal.
Diana, you'll ride up with me. Jones, your team has the stairwell.
Wow. 43 floors. Lucky I do cardio.
what are you doing with Caffrey?
I want to know where he is at all times, so he's coming with me.
if Peter's planning on taking you up to Richmond's, how is this gonna work?
he won't be taking me up.
there's a holding room right next to the guard's desk.
I'll make sure Peter locks me in there before going up to Richmond's.
it's a clear shot from there to the elevators.
you'll need padded shoes.
and your elevator-override box. - Okay.
it'll buy me time to hit Richmond before Peter gets there?
that's all it's gonna buy you. They'll be on the stairs.
you'll need another way down.
I know.
uh, there is no other way down. - I know.
you're keeping Neal close while you go in for the Degas?
I want to watch his expression when he sees the painting in my hand.
any chance he goes for the place tonight?
no, I've got a team monitoring his tracking data.
that doesn't mean he's not planning something.
I'm sure he is.
how are we gonna get the copy of the Degas and all the other stuff up to Richmond's in the first place?
you're gonna do it.
how?
we're gonna need a bazooka.
you are looking at an AT4 recoilless rifle.
made by Saab, fielded by U. S. and Swedish forces. Very popular in Afghanistan last summer.
how many do you have?
we'll go with 200.
should I be asking how you got them?
let's just say they fell off a truck.
how do I know nothing broke falling off that truck?
Oh, consider this a floor model.
test it out, and if you like it, we can talk about the other 199.
obviously I can't test it here.
Oh, take your time.
you know, I'll be in touch.
enjoy. Enjoy.
okay. The elevators are mine, Neal.
the rest is up to you.
team One in position on the stairs.
Thanks, Jones. We're moving in. - - I got it.
what are you planning to do with this?
always be prepared, right?
right.
FBI. We have a warrant to search the penthouse.
agent Peter Burke. I have a hostile witness on my hands.
do you have a storage room or an office that I can borrow while I'm conducting my business upstairs?
Yes, sir. Right over there. I'll show you.
Oh, come on, Peter. You cannot lock me in here.
watch me.
under no circumstances is he to leave.
he has no medical condition, he's had enough water, and he's been to the bathroom.
if he calls you, don't answer.
if he requests anything, don't acquiesce.
am I clear? I am the only person to open that door.
I'll be back down later.
everything okay with Neal?
he won't be going anywhere.
you there, Moz?
no names, nea - Oops.
got it.
what the hell?
we're stuck.
Jones, we've got a delay. Stand by.
call down to the guards.
we need this elevator moving immediately.
operation fedibuster is in play.
all right. Tell me when.
Yeah, we're stuck.
are you sure? - What?
are you kidding me? Yes, we're sure. Get this elevator moving.
come on. - now!
you'll have to be patient.
this could take a second.
get this elevator moving. Come on!
opening door now.
Neal, hurry up.
that was close.
it got my pulse going. - get us up or get us down.
I don't care what you do, just get us out of this elevator now.
you don't understand.
I'm rebooting the system, ma'am. It takes time to initialize.
get it done.
Hey, you know where he hid the painting?
I have an idea.
found it.
hurry, Neal. Your time is running out.
finally. Jones, we're on our way.
Roger that.
Neal, get out of there!
they've reached the penthouse. Get out of there.
coming!
come on in. After you.
you didn't bring the guns?
no. We brought this warrant instead.
Jones, we're clear.
elliott Richmond, you're under arrest for illegal arms trafficking.
Neal, Peter and Diana are with Richmond. I'm getting out of here.
good luck.
see you on the other side, Moz.
nailed the landing. - I need a drink.
took you a while.
run into some problems?
Richmond went down without a fight.
you found it.
don't jump to any conclusions.
Kramer still needs to weigh in.
all right.
any verdict yet?
this is consistent with the period where his dark palette gave way to bold colors.
the strokes angle slightly to the right.
so it's real?
the signature is dead on.
Degas was losing his sight toward the end.
there's a crispness - Neal, stay out of this.
no, no, he's quite right. But the oil is the real tell.
to make a work look authentic, pigments are bound with linseed oil, which takes roughly 50 years to dry.
when that finally happens, the oil starts evaporating, causing the surface to crack.
however...
yeah? - Please.
thank you.
Yeah.
these micro-cracks are slightly immature for a work that's supposed to be over a hundred years old.
good eye, Mr. Caffrey.
little more time in the oven, and it would have had me fooled.
so it's a forgery.
I'm sorry, Peter.
I know how much you wanted this.
petey... We took down an arms dealer and recovered a number of missing paintings.
this is still a win.
I thought for sure it was the real thing...
that the treasure was out there.
searching for the truth is what makes you a good agent.
you can't always be right.
in fact, the hardest thing to do is admit you're wrong, like I seemed to be about Neal.
you think he's changed?
I can't say it with conviction that he's reformed yet...
but I can tell you he wants to be here.
find Something interesting?
Hi, Chris.
you went all out for your undercover assignment.
really settled into the bureau.
the tie drawer's a nice touch.
maintaining cover is my specialty.
Oh, I know.
agent Jones told me how much he's enjoyed working with you all this time.
all right. You caught me. I'm not who I said I was.
no. You're Neal Caffrey, infamous con man and forger.
guilty as charged.
how long did you think you could keep this up?
not long, but I need to buy some time, and it was the only play I had.
Melissa, working with Peter has been one of the best things that's ever happened to me.
but he started cutting me out. You know how that feels.
he wasn't trusting me. - Imagine that.
I need to know why so I could fix it.
I'm sorry I brought you into this.
obviously, I'll have to tell Kramer everything.
of course.
we'll tell him the truth.
the whole truth.
if I tell him I told you about the existence of the U - boat manifest over Martinis, my career is over.
and you know that.
you really are Neal Caffrey.
welcome to White Collar.
it was impressive watching you work.
likewise.
whoever forged that painting is gonna make our work a whole lot more interesting.
Why's that?
because it's the best I've ever seen.
we did it, Moz.
the FBI is off our trail.
I've never known you to pass up a good bordeaux.
notice anything?
come on. Can we please enjoy our victory?
Neal, I've been really patient.
but it's time for you to make a choice.
do you want to leave or not?
no.
there are things about this life I'm not ready to give up.
do you even know what this life is anymore?
I mean, you're... On a leash.
you're still in prison.
you have Stockholm syndrome.
I can always walk out that door, Moz.
I can never walk back in.
well, then, you've made your choice.
I always thought ours would be a happy ending.
if you want a happy ending, it depends
on where you stop the story. Yeah, Orson Welles.
I'll see you around, Neal.
you're fooling yourself if you think this is who you really are.
honey, you're gonna drive yourself crazy.
I'm missing something, el.
you've looked as hard as you can. There's nothing more to find today.
but there will be, and when the right evidence surfaces...
...I'm afraid this will all blow up in Neal's face.
whatever mess he made, he made it.
and if it comes out, he's gonna have to clean it up.
so... What?
so come home... Have dinner...
relax with a bottle of your favorite beer...
and continue working on the case, because you are...
a workaholic? - ...Peter Burke, the archeologist.
Thanks, honey. I'll be home soon.
okay.
agent Burke. Working late again.
you're persistent, I'll give you that.
Keller. - Pardon the theatrics.
but under the circumstances, we can't be having this conversation in person.
I'm sure you understand.
what do you want, Keller?
I need your help.
my help.
turn yourself in. I'll see what I can do.
Yeah, I don't think I can do that, Burke.
but I tell you what - If you help me, I can help you.
our interests are more mutual than you think.
and you know this how?
because I've seen the treasure.
Yeah, your boy Caffrey's got it.
and you want it.
I'm a sucker for the game, Burke.
so, you gonna help me or what?
why would I help you? - That's a good question.
how about you go home and relax with a bottle of your favorite beer and think about it?
you could use some alone time.
boss.
neighbors saw a black van, Jersey plates.
she was alive when they took her.
we're all over major transportation centers.
he won't get out of the city without us knowing.
he took my wife.
the park removed my breakfast bench.
lucky me. What's in that?
nothing. Hence my woe.
you know, ira the voice-box says we missed our chance to nab a sargent painting.
ira the voice-box doesn't talk.
he signs. - What's your point?
Neal, we are con men, grifters, mountebanks, flimflammers.
we have to keep our skills sharp.
"flimflammers"?
see? I'm already becoming a dinosaur.
look, I get that you have to play boy scout until your commutation hearing, but you are seriously hindering my primal instinct.
I don't think a few more weeks will render you extinct, winosaurus.
okay. A few more weeks.
what happens if you get it? Have you thought about that?
my anklet comes off?
Yeah, and you're once again walking the streets of Manhattan a free man.
I could get a job.
a job? Seriously?
cause people love to hire ex-cons.
you're gonna look dashing in janitorial green.
I was thinking more along the lines of corporate security or paid consultant to the FBI.
a GS-10 with a 401.
keep your enemies close, right?
starting salary of 45 grand. That will not keep you in those fancy ties.
then I guess we will have to supplement my income.
this entire weekend, assume I do not exist.
don't e-mail me. Don't call me.
don't even think about calling you.
don't even think about thinking about calling you.
unless someone dies or Neal does something big, and maybe not even if someone dies.
the dead body might be mine. Christie and I are supposed to go ring shopping.
does that mean that you - Now that New York has legalized gay marriage...?
Yeah. Yeah, Christie proposed.
you're engaged! Congratulations!
congratulations, agent Berrigan.
well, you guys go shopping for rings. Jones can cover Neal.
Yeah. - No, no. This is an important assignment.
do not let Caffrey hijack your bling moment.
no, I want to help with Neal.
I'm kind of pushing for a longer engagement.
things are moving faster than I thought they would.
completely understand. - Yeah. Been there, been there.
all right, Well, then, have fun watching Neal.
why do I get the feeling this is about me?
not everything's about you.
Diana and christie are engaged.
Congratulations. When's the date?
what? I assume I'm invited.
follow me.
I'm not invited?
relax. What are your plans this weekend?
Mozzie has an in to meet the street artist Miss. Rule.
she waltzed into the met and put one of her pieces up
she sounds lovely, but you're booked.
I am?
get in. We'll talk about it. Actually, I'll talk. You'll listen.
it's Miss. Rule. - Drop off Miss. Rule.
this weekend, I'm gonna be too busy to deal with you not being busy.
Yes. Elizabeth's birthday.
you need time to scramble for a gift?
for once, I don't.
the charming Neal Caffrey will have to hElp Elsewhere.
you planned ahead. What'd you get her?
I sent all of our old photographs and wedding footage out to be professionally edited into a DVD montage.
sounds nice.
Yeah, I got the platinum package and everything.
comes in a beautiful satin-bound book.
and I'm flying in her parents.
your in-laws are coming?
Yeah. You don't look happy.
I don't? - No.
I have an entire weekend of her mom singing "bad boys" ahead of me.
Peter, you have to introduce me.
Oh, no, no. I'm not giving you that kind of ammunition.
but I'm - no.
you're working on a case involving a stolen stradivarius from the symphony.
all right. - You like that stuff.
all right, it's not "stuff.
Antonio Stradivari crafted some of the most unique and beautiful violins in the world.
there are only 650 left.
I knew you couldn't resist the lure of a rich provenance.
who's the case agent?
before I tell you, remember that your commutation hearing is coming up, and you should consider this an opportunity to impress Diana, Jones, and myself with your maturity and self-restraint.
Peter, what did you do?
you're loaning me to my ex-girlfriend?
she's helped us in the past. Now she's calling in her favor.
come on. Smile.
good. You're already getting along.
you'll keep him in line?
I'm in charge. He's my headache.
good. Everything's settled. You kids have fun.
wait. You're leaving?
Sara will fill you in. She's the boss on this one.
meet our suspect - Bryan Mckenzie.
McKenzie. Where have I heard that name before?
from me. He's V. P. Of Sterling Bosch's New York division.
you suspect your boss is mixed up with the missing stradivarius?
well, he's very busy developing relationships, trying to expand our brand past insurance.
he doesn't work the field anymore, but he took the violin on as a case, and then it went missing
doesn't add up. It's pre-1700- valuable but sells for less.
so why is Bryan interested in it?
when was it reported missing?
that's just the thing - It wasn't.
and I only know about it because I saw Bryan creating a file on it.
he said he would have it handled by the end of the weekend, and then he changed the subject.
well, if he thinks he has it handled, then he already has a head start.
well, he's been working from home the last day and has not left once, except...
to teach his daily tal chi class.
you've been following him?
well, I can't use Sterling Bosch resources to investigate my own boss.
that's why I called Peter.
he does like a good gut detector.
Bryan's, um... - Bigger in person?
easy, right? Just wouldn't want to come face-to-face with him in a very slow fight.
if Bryan is doing something illegal, he's putting my entire division at risk.
and with it, your job.
well, yes, and a lot of people's jobs. - Right.
now, unfortunately, I have to keep up appearances at work, but we'll reconvene tomorrow at 8: 00 a. m.
8: 00 a. m. On a Saturday?
Peter said I'm the boss.
you know he's secretly hoping this will bring us back together, right?
like "if he can get past you hiding the treasure, so can I" sort of thing?
if this is a problem for you... - No, no, not at all.
but we're going to establish one rule.
I love rules. - Good.
rule number 1 - Don't date the boss.
too late!
Freeze! F. B. - Oh, it's you.
are you expecting a girl scout packing heat?
I thought El's parents were early.
I told Diana to pick you up at home.
Yeah, and I told your babysitting service to pick me up here.
you're not being chaperoned. - Really?
all right, I'm cautious this weekend. Sue me.
afraid I'll crash the sears family portrait?
this is a handmade Mrs. Mitchell original. She's a wonderful woman.
with a delightful sense of humor.
they live in Illinois. It's cold.
I bet she makes matching t - shirts for family vacations. Am I right?
she works at a specialty-foods gift shop, and he's a psychiatrist. Now go.
he's a shrink? - Yeah.
I would pay to see you spend quality time with him.
look, we get along. He's a very interesting man.
he's very intelligent, discerning - Terrifying?
terrifying man.
I feel like I'm showing up for the first date with his daughter every time I see him.
and he's the one you get stuck with.
Exactly! Because El and her mom are constantly disappearing together.
he probably asks you about your feelings.
Yeah, and my dreams. And he stares.
he stares?
he - Oh, no. You're stalling.
what? - So that you can meet them.
what are you talking about? I'm trying to be a good friend.
Oh, my god.
okay. I'm a little embarrassed.
look at me. I'm hideous, I'm itchy, and I'm not a good enough liar to pull this off.
all right, remember, the best lies carry an element of truth.
that's them. - All right. No, just - just...
are they here yet?
you too. Out, both of you. now.
Bye.
keep an eye on Neal.
sure thing, Dr. Huxtable. - Nice
right on time for duty... Cadet.
she thinks she's in charge.
Jones, she roped you into this, too?
well, Peter said to help her legally so you wouldn't have to illegally.
we are trying to pinpoint exactly when the stradivarius went missing.
the symphony recently returned from a tour in China.
now, the strad is listed among the items they took through customs, so it must have disappeared when they got here to New York.
the interesting part is that Bryan was in Beijing the same time the symphony was.
he assessed the violin before it traveled.
says here he was detained by customs on his way back.
Yeah, they held him for a few hours, but he came back clean, so they won't divulge their interest in him.
well, maybe his files have the answer.
I mean, he's been working from home. We could pay a visit.
you know a thing or two about making house calls, don't you, Neal?
agent Kramer. Nice to see you again.
Peter didn't tell you I was coming?
he told me. I'll be helping you while you're here.
thank you, Diana, agent Jones.
I don't believe we've met.
Hi. Sara Ellis with Sterling Bosch.
insurance. I hope Neal hasn't gotten himself into any more trouble.
no.
no. Believe it or not, he's actually helping us on this one.
good to hear. I'll leave you to it.
see you around, Neal.
look forward to it, sir.
you can handle... them?
why is Kramer here?
I don't know. What I do know is that you're not breaking in to Bryan's apartment.
well, we're running out of time for a warrant.
maybe that cute paralegal in Judge Muir's office.
boys, as much as I am enjoying this, you don't need a warrant.
I have a key.
Freeze! FBI!
Peter, you know what you are?
Yes, I do. I'm a bad boy. Bad boy.
I'm gonna go help Alan and El with the bags.
hold on. Let me have a look at you.
you're wearing my sweater!
I'm surprised it's still holding up. He wears it all the time.
honey, I-I could have helped you with those bags.
I got it, Peter. I've got it.
so glad you could make it, Alan.
thank you.
I see you've been here before.
does Bryan make keys for all his employees?
a few, for work or... - Pleasure?
and here I thought you were the honest type. What happened to rule number one?
my private life is still private, Neal.
I understand. Honest women make me uncomfortable anyway.
now, why is that? 'Cause you're not honest with them?
I hate feeling at a disadvantage.
I didn't lie to you.
no, you simply with held certain truths.
Yes. - So I shouldn't be upset.
exactly. - Exactly.
Oh, my god. You know what?
hiding priceless treasure and hiding an ex-boyfriend are two totally different things.
now, can we please focus? Because Bryan's gonna close this case in two days.
so, if you really want my help solving this case, I have to know why you were in BeiJing with Bryan.
okay. You got me. We dated. It was years ago.
you're wearing the same new shoes.
all right, so I might have seen him recently.
he was your rebound off me.
well, that seems only natural, considering you were my rebound off of him.
you know, Sara, I'm starting to see a pattern emerge. You have a type.
Yes. Apparently, I date criminals.
alleged criminals. I get it. More interesting.
Bryan was not a criminal when we dated, and I left him early in Beijing, right when he became interested in the violin.
Yeah, I think you should probably tell me everything, starting at the beginning.
fine.
when I first started at Sterling Bosch, Bryan was still working the field.
we broke cases together - valuable objects, intriguing stories, exotic places.
quite the globetrotter.
well, one thing led to another - Tell - don't show.
eventually, he expressed his desire to expand Sterling Bosch beyond insurance.
I didn't agree with this direction and realized how different we were.
so I broke off our engagement.
engagement?
engagement. Now you know everything.
feels really good to share. You should try that sometime.
so, that's the last of Caffrey's files.
I have my work cut out for me.
any shortcuts you can talk to me about so I don't waste my time?
sorry. I know it's a lot, but everything you need for the report's in there.
D. C. misses you, agent Berrigan.
you ever feel the same?
it's a beautiful city.
the potomac at your feet.
I like the pace of New York.
that why Peter brought you back?
he must really rely on you to help him with Neal.
Peter's got that handled.
do you need anything else, agent Kramer?
I'll find you if I do.
Caffrey and Sara are probably re-enacting "moonlighting" by now.
everything okay with Kramer?
Yeah. He's collecting intel for Neal's hearing.
so watch what I say about Caffrey.
Kramer's asking a lot of questions.
how long's Bryan been into synchronized meditation?
Bryan's in phenomenal shape.
no wonder you went back to him.
I did not go back to him.
we flinged. People fling after a few glasses of wine.
that's lucky. My flings never landed me in beijing.
Bryan was trying to rekindle something that's not there anymore, okay?
well, we don't know where he hid the strad files, but we know where he'll be this afternoon.
first we go in BeiJing, and now he's going here. Bryan hates the symphony.
well, he must be going for something else.
and we need to go. - What, to the symphony?
go" go. Bryan's home early.
you can't go that way! We have to hide!
Sara, I'm not gonna hide. - Stop it!
my purse! - No, Sara!
what are you doing here?
I'm here 'cause you gave me a key.
the last time I saw you... We were there.
now you're here. Why?
well... I think you know why.
I want to hear you say it.
okay. I missed you.
from the withered tree, a flower blooms. I knew you'd be back.
sorry I left you in Beijing.
that hurt.
there I was, in a foreign country getting savaged by customs, and my girlfriend... abandons me.
why did they target you?
bureau cratic nonsense.
they have to look like they're doing their job, and they chose me as the example.
that's terrible.
worst part is, it ruined our trip.
I hated thinking the girl that got away got away again.
well, you know how you could make it up to me?
take me to the symphony. We had so much fun in beijing.
Yeah. You're good. Clever girl.
what do you mean?
you saw the invite, didn't you?
well, what can I say? I love the symphony.
but I don't. - Let me convince you.
I'm trying to convince your father.
to go on a culinary tour of Basque country? Good luck.
you and Peter should come with us.
no, Peter could never get away with his schedule.
then we should go - Leave the two of them to fend for themselves.
you ladies need some help in there?
Nope. We'll be there in just a second.
maybe they'll finally hit it off this time.
how you doing, Peter?
good. Work is good. I'm good.
work is good?
Yeah. That's interesting.
Yeah. How's your work, Alan?
psychiatry is always thriving.
mental instability is everywhere you look.
never mind about us. This is about honeybee.
there you go, dad. - Woman of the hour.
there's your tea. - Always taking care of everybody.
honey, here's your beer. - Thank you.
Alan, give El her present.
is it time for presents?
here you go. - Thank you.
this is amazing!
where did you find this? I lost this when I was little.
you did. It broke our hearts, you were so upset.
I was cleaning the basement, and I found it in a crawl space.
we know how much you loved her, so we had her restored for you.
now you have a little piece of your childhood back.
always good to stay in touch with your roots.
right, Peter?
that's right, Alan.
well, this - this is amazing, you guys. I'm truly... touched.
I - I got to go show Peter. Honey!
look at this.
what? What, what, what?
that's... great. Do you love it?
I hated it. I've always hated it.
well... It's not so bad.
honey, look at it. It looks at you with those creepy-ass eyes like she wants your soul.
do you know how that feels?
I can imagine.
and I didn't lose it. I stuck it in a crawl space, and it's back.
well, but you know what? It - it's the thought that counts.
Hey, you two, get back in here!
I'm gonna give you your present later.
okay. Okay.
what Neal found was a surveillance tape from the symphony.
now, obviously, the security is pretty outdated.
this only shows the hallway outside where they kept the strad.
this is from Wednesday, when it went missing.
no activity at all?
Yeah, I thought it was strange, too, so we examined the tape - It's pretty worn.
when that happens, you see the tearing in the frame.
can you retrieve the old footage?
that's where we shine. We have the technology to rebuild it.
so here's the first image that we recovered.
do you recognize her?
no. But that does look like the stradivarius.
I'm going to the concert with Bryan later.
good. You can make an I. D.observe their interaction.
wait. If Bryan went to the trouble of recording over this footage, he's probably going back to the symphony to return the security tapes.
you need to put the original back.
I'm meeting him at his place before we go, so I'll just do it then.
thank you.
see ya. - bye.
Diana, how do you feel about classical?
way ahead of you, Caffrey.
I know you'll go to that concert no matter what we say, so I'll be escorting you.
escorting me? Should I bring you a corsage?
they didn't let me go to prom.
Really?
well, they can't stop you from getting married.
you've been dying to bring that up.
am I invited now? - Yeah.
Yes. - When it happens, you're invited.
listen, I make a pretty good best-man speech.
okay, don't push it.
Hey, you should let Caffrey throw the bachelor party.
now, that I will consider. - You won't forget it.
Caffrey, I want to go to that party.
you're on the short list.
see ya, Jones.
agent Kramer.
Neal, nice to see you working so hard when Peter's not around.
I like to help where I can.
so, if any questions come up while you're reviewing my files, I'm here.
I'm beefing up on your cases to give the FBI's official response on your commutation.
we do it for every hearing involving one of our guys.
so it's a formality?
Yeah, but I'm impressed with what you've done here so far.
thank you, but I couldn't have done it alone.
so I'm noticing.
keep up the good work, Neal.
we may keep you around.
here are the backgrounds.
they match June's tickets.
now all we do is print the tickets on top of that, and you, my friend, have top-tier seats to the symphony.
it's too bad the Sumners are at the royal riviera.
you know, I could have swiped those tickets for you.
saved you an awful lot of trouble.
june, are you sure the Sumners didn't give away their seats?
15B is Preston's favorite roulette play.
he feels it's bad luck if anyone except a Sumner sits in that seat.
but you said the family never goes.
Yeah, entitlement issues of the rich and not famous.
all right. Here are your originals.
well, as our resident expert, would you authenticate?
well, it's enough to... fool me.
and we all know, I am no fool.
no, you are not. You're a lifesaver.
thank you so much, June. - Thank you.
Bye, June. - Bye, now.
so, how's it going with little Miss Repo?
little less "war of the roses" now that there are no secrets between us.
have you forgotten about the battle of the missing raphael?
okay. Fewer secrets between us.
Hey, Peter. - You busy?
well, you said you were too busy for me not to be. How's everything going?
I can't get a moment alone.
Peter! It's your turn.
okay, okay, yeah. One second. One second.
they'd only let me escape to make a work call, which didn't please her dad.
is he staring?
like a creepy doll.
you - you want to come over and ease the glare?
as much as I would love that ammunition, you made Sara the boss today.
damn it. El hates the gift her parents gave her.
now there's extra pressure on mine to be great.
well, you said it would be.
well, I thought it was, but in reality, it looks like they didn't send the platinum package.
and now I can't get a minute to check the disc.
is Mozzie there?
that cat can dance.
you must be really desperate.
like a caged animal. - I'll send him over.
I'm only doing this for Elizabeth.
Mozzie, what are you doing here?
well, birthdays only come but once a year, for those of you using the julian calendar.
here, I got you this, uh... - What?
Oh, thanks for making me look good.
Mozzie, this is a Miss. Rule.
how did you get this? - How did you get it?
I paid for it. But let's keep that between us.
as they say, three may keep a secret if two of them are dead.
only Benjamin Franklin said that.
you know he invented the bifocal. - Yes.
that's a factoid, actually.
the Dollonds made spectacles of that type for years before Franklin got credit, but misinformation within an elitist, patriarchal society runs deep.
you're distrustful of our founders?
Mozzie is distrustful of a lot of things.
a true Marxist!
long live the Proletariat!
come on in.
now you may thank me, suit.
I chose white. Goes with everything.
Thanks.
what do you say we listen to music, stand around awkwardly, and wait for the night to end?
Sara and Bryan look cozy.
Really? I didn't notice.
step over here, please.
Bryan just snuck through the metal detector.
he's definitely not here for the concert.
we got a problem.
the symphony must have updated their security system when the strad went missing.
our tickets don't have a barcode.
what do we do now? - We'll be fine. Go with me.
can I help you, sir?
I hope so. I'm Preston Sumner III. My grandfather called ahead.
I'm sorry, sir. I never got word to print these tickets.
well, phone connections from Nice can be tricky, but as you can see, these are my granddaddy's seats - Lucky 15b for black.
right, sir, but only a Sumner can
can sit in a Sumner's seat. Yes, this is my wife, Diana.
doesn't she look lovely tonight? She's an avid fan.
Dudamel's mastery of Mahler's 5th symphony last month was breathtaking.
if you'd like to verify with my grandfather, he's at the royal riviera.
that won't be necessary.
in fact, Maurie... Can you take them in?
Maurie's our resident instrument expert. He'll tell you all about the show.
lovely. Thank you so much.
right this way.
do you know if any of the instruments we'll be hearing tonight are unique?
quite special, in fact.
our second violinist will be playing an hilaire, and the first, a nagyvary.
a modern string said to match the sound of a stradivarius.
don't be fooled. Nothing beats the original.
will we get a chance to compare?
I hear the symphony has a stradivarius.
we do... But it's fragile.
we only feature it opening and closing nights.
excuse me. Second violin calls.
thank you so much.
that's true.
recognize our klimt portrait?
it says here Annie Chaite is second violin.
so we know Bryan and Annie are connected somehow, and he snuck something past security.
all right. I'll keep an eye on Bryan.
go check with Sara.
Oh, gosh! Sorry. I should watch where I'm going.
you're Neal Caffrey.
I usually pride myself on keeping a lower profile. What gave me away?
who, actually.
my girlfriend - She was after you for a stolen raphael.
spent a lot of late nights on you.
you going to intervene? - No.
no, I'm only concerned with one instrument here, not in watching them swing theirs.
did you clock Bryan getting through security?
Yep.
I guess I was the spark she need to escape a... monotonous routine.
until she realized fireworks don't have a lasting flame.
you know, the nice thing about fireworks - There's usually a second show.
well, you boys look like you're getting along.
famously. You remember Neal, sweetie.
hard to forget.
nice to see you, Sara.
you don't mind if they join us for drinks afterward, do you?
I can't think of anything more fun.
I'm Diana, by the way.
great. We'll find you after the show.
well, at least we know Bryan and Annie won't be meeting up anytime soon.
come on.
so, I told Derrida,"I will see your deconstructionism, and I will raise you transcendent abnegation.
you've created your own philosophical bubble.
I'm on my third manifest.
Peter, where did you find him?
well, like Alan said, mental instability is everywhere.
Mozzie's a friend of Neal, who is Peter's c. i.
well, you've lived an extraordinary life.
I have, haven't i?
as Abbie Hoffman said to me,"sacred cows make the best hamburger."
now, if you'll excuse me, I do have to go to the restroom.
rampant narcissism, delusions of grandeur, paranoia from overblown sense of self.
he's... - Insane?
...magnificent!
well, it's a shame about his rabid kleptomania.
he needs constant supervision. I should go check on him.
you're sitting on my bed?
that chair is not ergonomically supportive.
you're good with the crazies.
her dad's liking your lies better than my truths.
they're not lies to those of us who have our eyes open.
how's my video?
that's a smile. It's good, right? It's touching.
definitely touching, especially the gladdening of the bride.
what?
the traditional yemeni custom whereby music sounds throughout the community.
that's Pir and Elethia Baakrime.
they had a beautiful ceremony where sweetened fritters and doughnuts were prepared .
to symbolize the sweet life they would have together It's cute, huh?
Oh, god, they sent the wrong video. Oh, god.
Oh, of course. Why shouldn't I ruin El's birthday with her father here?
well, on the up side, the Baakrime are probably really enjoying the footage of Elizabeth's bridal shower.
you need to help me, Mozzie.
I've got 24 hours to fix this.
Mozzie, stop watching!
What'd you have in mind?
we need a scanner.
the lab is uploading the images via FTP now.
the jpegs will be opening in sequence.
thank you, Wesley.
let me know if you need anything else.
know where to find you.
reminds me of a flip book.
turn the pages, see the man fall.
only this one's hopefully gonna show us where the girl hid the violin.
Ah, the Sara Ellis case.
she the same Sara Ellis who targeted Caffrey for stealing a raphael?
Yep.
now they're working together? Funny how things turn out.
Ah, Neal keeps things interesting.
Yeah. You like having him at the FBI?
I do.
then you should say so at his hearing.
Jones? Sara ever get her raphael?
I think you should ask her about that one.
looks like your flip book's done.
Hey, Jones. - Caffrey.
we got the rest of the tape back. You got eyes on Bryan and Sara?
Sara's in her seat, and we followed Bryan to the bathroom. What's up?
there's another person on this tape.
who?
I don't know, but he's in room 207, and she clearly hands him the violin.
all right, I'll call you back.
Annie may not be his target.
damn it! There's a second exit.
excuse me. Where's room 207?
Mr. Sumner. - Room 207. Where is it?
it's Maurie's room backstage, but...
how did this happen?
well, we think Bryan slipped out of the bathroom to confront Maurie.
but security's in mid-update, so we don't have video, and Sara said Bryan wasn't gone for more than five minutes.
is her cover blown?
no, it's intact.
we made a show of searching everyone, including her and Bryan.
if he had a weapon, he ditched it.
and the stradivarius?
E.R.T.'s inspecting it as we speak.
sounds like you have everything handled.
Yeah, Well, you said to call if someone died.
so I'm calling.
Thanks, Jones. Keep me posted.
when we got back from beijing, our manager left the strad in his office.
you saw your chance to play it.
I'm second violin.
it was the only time I'd get to play such a special instrument.
but i, uh... I damaged it.
so you gave it to Maurie to fix.
I panicked.
he said he could fix it and put it back before anyone would notice.
do you have any idea why someone would want to kill him?
no. He was such a nice man.
Annie had nothing to do with this.
you think we can get this figured out before Peter decides to come in?
well, let's take a look at that violin, and we'll find out.
E.R.T. says it's clean.
no secrets, no hidden compartments.
nothing but a stradivarius.
okay. So, I'm Bryan.
Really? 'cause I have more in common with him.
I'm Bryan.
I'm going out of my way to search for a pricy violin when I find out Maurie has it.
you approach Maurie, you ask for it, and for whatever reason, Maurie resists.
so I kill him.
and leave the strad behind? It doesn't make sense.
a tuning peg's been ripped off.
well, annie said she broke a string.
Yeah, but when you break a string, it breaks - It doesn't snap the violin.
Sara, what work was Bryan doing in beijing?
he was at the peking sci-tech convention to research expanding...
sterling Bosch's tech division.
Jones, can you check and see if anything was stolen from that convention?
no, I-I already did. Local authorities said nothing suspicious went down.
you're right. Nothing at the convention.
one of the vendors reported a carbon polymer was stolen from their lab.
according to this, its low mass and structural integrity make it one of the strongest materials in the world.
capable of enhancing medical development, imaging technologies, body armor, and even building an elevator to space.
Bryan does dream big.
guess what it looks like.
a violin string.
when Maurie went to fix it, he must have realized something was wrong, become an obstacle
so Bryan stole this to launch Sterling Bosch into the tech world.
he knew anyone who was at that convention would be flagged trying to leave the country.
he couldn't get through customs.
Yeah, so he hid the string on the violin to pass inspection, then he went through separately - smart.
so we know where it came from.
and we know how it got here.
the only question left is, where's the string now?
is this what you're looking for?
you really are a clever girl.
didn't take a genius to figure out something was up.
you were angry after what went down after the concert, and I figured you never got what you wanted.
I'm assuming you're here for a reason.
I'm here to turn our relationship into a genuine partnership.
this must be very important.
it only constitutes a sector of industry that's worth billions.
this is going to put Sterling Bosch on the map, isn't it?
tech development is the future.
you want to work for China, or do you want to be China?
I want to be with you, Bryan, working right alongside you every step of the way.
sounds like sara missed her calling.
Bonnie to any man's clyde?
she sells this whole partner thing.
you could take some notes, wifey.
you just won't let it alone, huh?
you're one of the few people I've seen who isn't thrilled to be engaged.
it's just strange when something you never thought was a possibility suddenly is.
you're worried it's too good to be true?
just takes a second to get used to.
why the change of heart?
I'm tired of living parallel lives thinking that you and I are moving in the same direction.
we're not even on the same track. I want you to let me in.
wonder if she's speaking from experience.
she's lying to get a confession.
whatever helps you sleep at night.
you're really in this with me?
till the very end.
because you love me?
too bad I don't believe you.
he knows she's lying. Come on.
what?
if you had kissed me half as passionately as you looked at Caffrey, this might have ended nicely.
Bryan, what are you talking about? That ended.
but it's not over.
goodbye, Sara.
Bryan, is this a joke?
no.
Bryan, you don't want to do this.
FBI! Put down your weapon!
drop the weapon and we can talk.
you first.
it's okay.
back down unless you want a bullet in your face!
can I please do the honors?
why not? You've earned it, cadet.
Bryan, that looks like the weapon that killed Maurie.
what with that and the confession we got on tape...
sterling Bosch will need a new V. P.
thank you for the baton.
Bryan mckenzie, you have the right to remain silent.
you okay? - Yeah. You?
we make a pretty good team.
we do, on the case, which is now closed.
right. So you're no longer my boss.
sadly.
so I guess we'll just... - We'll be friends.
friends, right.
you know, friends go out occasionally.
they do, don't they?
well, then maybe you should call me sometime.
your dad fell asleep on the couch. I don't want to wake him.
you mean you're afraid to wake him.
no comment.
el, I'm so sorry you didn't get what you wanted for your birthday.
honey, it's okay. My parents were just trying to be thoughtful.
I know I'm gonna love your gift.
I hope so.
surprise!
what?
you're always so busy planning dinners for other people, it's about time someone planned a dinner for you.
you guys are so sweet.
honey, right here is my gift.
this is beautiful.
a wise man said,"it's good to keep in touch with your roots.
from my first family... To my second.
is that a tear? I got one.
this is a lovely thing to do, Peter. Right, Alan?
nice going.
we live to make our girl content.
as do I, sir.
Satchmo. Satchmo, no!
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Satchmo! - Oh, no, he's gonna bury it.
I don't think that's coming back.
I'm getting a drink.
thank you. - Happy birthday.
we're closing up for the night. You wanted to see me?
I did.
Yes. Sit down.
Diana... You like working for Peter.
the FBI is my home.
no one wants to lose their home.
what are you getting at, agent Kramer?
going through these files have made me realize Caffrey's got a lot of secrets, the kind he can't cover up alone.
you think I'm helping him?
I think maybe you and Peter turn a blind eye.
but if I keep digging... ...who knows what will turn up?
you won't find anything.
you sure about that?
I think we have to talk about Neal's commutation.
none to speak of.
marital status?
Seriously?
you and Sara are getting along again. Maybe you eloped.
Vegas is a little outside my radius. Do you have to fill that out right now?
your commutation hearing is in a week. I put this off as long as I could.
would you say you have a girlfriend?
that's really on there?
Neal, the board is deciding whether to release you from your anklet from me permanently.
they want to know who's in your life.
are they a good influence, or are they gonna steer you back to the dark side?
and you think Sara could be an angel on my shoulder?
as opposed to that little devil you have on your shoulder now.
Mozzie's more of an imp than a devil.
but I was released into your custody.
ultimately, what you say at the hearing will carry the most weight.
okay.
target approaching.
he sure knows how to make friends.
he's one of the most beloved cons in the world.
and no criminal record.
he's a pro.
makes me wonder if that would be you
if you hadn't caught me? I'd like to think so.
if Gordon Taylor's in town, it means he's here to do a job.
he's a key suspect in some of the biggest heists in the past decade.
Antibes. That the location of his last job?
no, that's his villa.
they say you can hear his parties all the way across the Mediterranean.
that's not true. - Reminds me of college.
regardless, Taylor is a contract thief.
we need to find out who hired him and what they're planning to steal.
how is it Taylor doesn't have a record?
he has a saying - "Nobody gets caught. Everybody gets paid."
and so far, he's lived up to that.
he also has a very loyal following, and it helps that the public loves him.
even his victims say nice things.
check this out.
this was a heist he ran in Paris.
he dove out of a second-story window onto this guy's peugeot.
two weeks later, Taylor sends a check to the owner to cover the damages.
claimed he heard about the car on the news.
because he's popular, it's difficult to find witnesses willing to talk.
he's careful, and he's smart. This isn't gonna be easy.
we need to find out what he's hitting and when. He hires locally.
Neal, talk to the street, figure out what kind of crew he's putting together.
Diana, follow the money trail surrounding his trip.
Jones, cover surveillance on the hotel.
I want intel on everyone he meets.
you got it.
boss, you got a minute?
Yeah.
can I speak freely?
of course.
when agent Kramer was here last week, he told me he doesn't think Neal deserves to have his sentence commuted.
Kramer told you that?
he wanted to know what I planned to say when I testify at Neal's hearing.
he didn't say anything to me.
he knows you consider Neal a friend.
can I ask... - What am I gonna say at the hearing?
I haven't decided.
Kramer's sending some of his people to pick up Neal's old prison letters.
his letters to Kate?
we always suspected they contained codes, but we could never crack them.
maybe he thinks he can.
give Kramer what he wants.
if he asks me to go behind your back?
I can't imagine he would.
if he does?
if he does, do it.
but I want you to tell me about it.
I may be jeopardizing a wonderful career opportunity back in D.C.
I thought Christie hated D.C
she does. And I work for you.
without leaps of imagination, you lose the excitement of possibility.
are you quoting Gloria Steinem?
she's not just for feminists.
she has unlocked what's missing in our lives. We need jobs.
if she only knew who she inspired.
Oh, she does. But not any job.
a good job. A big job.
well, I have to be careful about taking those kind of jobs at the moment, okay?
look, I know this is risky with your big hearing coming up, but this is too good to pass up.
you are looking at the first man hired to be part of Gordon Taylor's next score.
no, no, no, Moz. The FBI is after Taylor.
Peter and I are chasing down his crew.
me! You're looking for me. I'm his crew.
pull out. You're gonna get caught.
Taylor never gets caught, and everybody gets paid!
have you already said yes?
Yeah, of course I did. No one says no to Taylor.
and he asked me about you to be his possible point man.
he asked about me?
point. Man.
all right, there's a way we can still do this, but you're gonna have to work with us.
"us" - You mean the suits?
Yeah.
you're already in. Taylor's going down one way or another.
Yeah, I don't want to be the one to bring him down.
look, if we do this right, no more anklet, no more prison. I'll be free, Moz.
look, Neal, I - I want to help you.
really, I do, but not in this way.
come on. The guy's a legend.
all right, how about this? You keep your integrity intact.
you said Taylor was asking about me, so set up the meeting.
then you've done your part.
if he takes you on, I will not wear a wire, I will not testify, and I will not lie to Taylor.
you won't have to. It'll be like we're really doing the job.
Yeah, without the fun.
or the threat of prison.
like I said.
this case takes us home, Moz.
home. That's an apropos analogy, considering the target.
Why? What's the target?
Taylor's gonna hit Yankee Stadium?
it's a good job.
got to hand it to you.
took you all of 24 hours to find out Taylor's target.
well, not only that, but as an added bonus, I've figured out a way to work Mozzie into his crew.
Really? Are you in his crew?
not yet. But I'm thinking that's the way to go on this one. Me and Moz on the inside.
any idea what Taylor's going after in there?
Nope.
I don't know what you're planning, but you are one week away from freedom, and you are really playing with fire here.
you're welcome.
let's go to the ballpark.
you're in a good mood.
my dad took me to a day game when I was 8.
decided then and there I wanted to play for the Yankees.
Yeah, you and every other 8 year-old at the game.
Yeah. I did end up getting pretty good.
I'm sure you did.
I imagine a shelf somewhere loaded with little-league trophies.
Yankee Stadium.
new house that Ruth built.
new cathedral of baseball.
the new Bronx Zoo.
you must be Geoffrey, head of security. Special agent Peter Burke.
well, thanks for the heads up. Looked over the file you sent.
he's never used a weapon or a threat of violence?
no, but we can't relax.
we know Taylor intends to strike somewhere in the stadium.
we're trying to identify the likely times and targets.
well, the vaults below are secure, but we handle millions in cash from concessions every game.
you should vary the pick-up and drop-off times.
and of course, the public has easy access to the museum.
I think we should see that for ourselves.
all right.
this is awesome. -Okay.
you know, we can't even place a value on most of these pieces of history.
they're each one-of-a-kind.
is all your memorabilia in this room?
well, most of it's concentrated in here, but we also have championship trophies and retired jerseys throughout the building.
got to be millions of square feet to cover.
we should get blueprints.
slugger.
right. Uh, could we trouble you for building plans and a chart of the display cases and security cameras?
sure. Why don't you wait here while I pull it all together?
I, uh - I get the feeling you'd like to look around a little more.
Thanks, Geoffrey. - Sure.
go ahead.
being here, all this... reminds me of watching games with my dad.
your dad take you to a lot of games?
no. Mostly we'd watch them on TV.
he'd run an extension cord out to the porch, put on our yankee caps, crack open a beer.
way to go, dad.
well, root beer for me.
during commercials, we'd throw the ball around.
sounds like something to go home for.
it is. And when I go back, we still do it.
except now I drink real beer.
Oh, man. What I'd pay to have that bat in my collection.
I bet it's a lot of money for that piece of wood.
"piece of wood"?
Yeah. I mean, take away the fact that Dimaggio swung it, it's just a bat.
but some guy named Pollock can splatter paint on a canvas and you think it's worth millions of dollars.
"Splatter paint on a canvas"?
you stand in front of one of Pollock's works, the chaos fades away and you see the discipline, the balance of restraint and abandon.
like when Dimaggio stepped up to the plate.
great art has a broader meaning. It captures a time, a place, an emotion.
this bat was used to set the all-time hit-streak record the same year hirohito bombed Pearl Harbor.
for four, five at-bats a day, Dimaggio let Americans forget that we were going to war.
a time, a place, an emotion.
this bat, those balls, these pennants got this country through some tough times.
they still do.
gives us something to root for.
and if you work hard, swing for the fences...
...anything's possible.
that's how you feel about baseball?
that's how a lot of people feel about baseball.
Yankees security is sending over more surveillance footage.
great. Where's Caffrey?
prepping for his audition for Taylor's crew.
a bit like putting a drink in the hands of an alcoholic.
reformed alcoholic, I know. And it's more like a bottle.
but putting Caffrey side by side with someone like Taylor is the best way to nail him.
here's some surveillance from the hotel.
Yes, I know. It's Mozzie. He's Neal's in.
how convenient.
so long as he stays on our side, we don't ask questions.
we've granted Mozzie immunity.
to preserve his street cred, you want us to arrest him if we catch him?
and make it look real.
Oh, I will. - Same for Caffrey.
Taylor knows a lot about Neal, but our backstop has held up.
that he was released two years ago but remains a person of interest in a number of elegant high-profile crimes.
any other questions?
good. Let's make the Yankees proud.
billiards. Couldn't be a better audition.
don't get cocky. The man is unparalled.
he has won the Taylor world championship so many times they named the tournament after him.
are you jealous?
I'm ecstatic for him.
it gives me hope knowing that Taylor and his villa on the French Riviera even exist.
of course I want to be him.
I assume his game is eight ball.
Oh, it is. Winning is important, but more so, he says he can learn everything he needs to know about you by how you play pool.
how competitive you are, what risks you take, your level of confidence...
did you get any more info on what he's after?
Taylor is true to his rep. He promises no details until the game is afoot.
it's a good way to keep a crew honest.
Yeah. We could learn a lot from him.
Oh, and when you meet him, he's gonna give you a big bear hug.
it seems like he's just being effusive, because he is.
but what he's really doing is - Giving me the pat-down.
exactly. - Got it.
Oh, that must be your cue.
to do what?
no, I mean your new cue.
hello. - Hi, June.
now, while I still have serious reservations about your participation,
I felt compelled to give you the best shot at success.
gentlemen, may I present Lord Byron.
june, I love you.
I mean, Byron must have run the tables with this.
you know, for some reason, every great con man in the world needs to master the game of pool at some point in his life.
I was 9 years old.
there was a pool hall on my way home from school.
a pool hall in St. Louis, Missouri. Must have been full of hustlers.
Yeah. I was one of them.
thank you.
Hi, Peter . - Hi, Sara.
what's going on, aside from that mustard stain about to happen?
thank you. Can I get you anything?
no. - Here you go.
no, that's all right.
the board is putting together a list of character witnesses for Neal's commutation hearing.
I'm sorry his what?
he didn't mention that to you?
no.
commutation hearing? So Neal might be set free?
it's possible.
and why would they do that?
after Keller's arrest, the board of corrections recommended an early release for Neal.
well, good for him. - Yeah.
only Caffrey, huh?
well, could be. It's far from settled.
how do you think it's gonna go?
the board knows that you testified against Neal at his trial.
yes I was very upset about that Raphael back then.
but somehow, you were able to get past that far enough to start dating him.
so if I testify, my relationship with Neal is likely to come up as public record?
it might get a little uncomfortable.
no, no, no. It's not the relationship, Peter .
it's why we broke up that poses the problem.
I'm gonna assume pleading the fifth is not ideal at these hearings.
no. No, it's not.
honestly, I don't know where Neal and I stand right now.
you might want to think about it.
here comes your 2: 00.
Hi. Neal Caffrey.
welcome.
so, uh, you're a pool player.
Yeah, I like to play.
of course, I don't know if I'm in your league.
well, there's only one way to find out, isn't there?
let me just finish up.
you're up.
so, Neal, tell me about yourself.
when did you get out?
18 months and 17 days ago, not that I've been counting.
I've never been to the big house, myself.
it does not look like fun.
it certainly forced me to be more cautious.
I can tell.
you haven't given me very many choices.
c'est la vie.
so, what do you think, Neal?
let the boss win so you can get the job?
absolutely not.
correct. I prefer honesty over ass-kissing.
thought you might appreciate the challenge.
of course, I don't mind the occasional puckering up.
excellent effort.
except you've left yourself with no shot.
eight ball, corner pocket.
what if I can make that shot?
I don't think you can.
if I make that shot right now, will you hire me on the spot?
listen, Neal, you play aggressively, but with grace.
you think ahead, and if half of what I've heard about the u-boat treasure is true, then I definitely want you on my team.
but you're over-reaching, and that is a very bad sign.
I can make the shot.
you make it, you're in. You miss, you walk out the door.
all right.
welcome aboard.
same place tomorrow morning, we'll go over the plan.
I'll be there.
it's open.
Hi, Neal.
Sara. Hi.
this is a surprise.
Yeah, today is that kind of day.
Oh, you need my help on another case?
no. Peter told me about your commutation hearing.
Oh, yeah. That.
Yeah, that. Congratulations.
thank you.
how long have you known about it?
a while. - Yeah?
you didn't say anything about it when we... reconnected.
Yeah.
look, I didn't bring it up because I didn't want to ask you to appear at the hearing.
you didn't trust what I would say?
no. We worked together, and it went really well.
Yeah, I thought so.
I didn't want you to think it was because I needed you to say nice things about me.
well, I appreciate that.
don't do it again.
what?
Neal, what are we doing right now?
talking? - Yes, we're talking.
we're being open with each other. That is what we need to do.
I don't need you to protect me by hiding things from me, all right?
cause that's where we got tripped up last time.
that, and a multi-billion-dollar uboat treasure, you know, explosion.
all right. Tonight, you and I are gonna talk.
not about your hearing, but we are gonna talk.
what do we talk about?
everything.
quid pro quo.
I am an open book.
Really?
I think I know where to start.
of course you do.
how many other former fiances do you have?
okay.
and do they all practice tal chi?
stop it. It was just the one.
Really? - It was the one.
are you sure?
is your real name Neal?
that is a very long story.
it sounds like a really good story.
it's really boring, and I'd prefer it, frankly, if you started with something a little more innocuous.
gonna have to work into it? - Yeah.
Hi! - Good morning.
Peter will be down in just a second. Come on in.
you, uh, want some breakfast?
I would love some.
good. - Thank you.
this place looks great, by the way.
Thanks!
you're, uh, awfully chipper this morning.
so are you.
el, you are a tigress! A tigress!
honey! - Oh, I know when you
Hey, Neal. You grab some breakfast?
I'm not hungry anymore.
you're early.
I'm excited to get started on this case.
excited to work with Taylor?
excited to bring Taylor to justice.
have you ever heard of Robert Withrow, jr.
wealthy, entitled son of Robert Withrow, jr.and owner of the Withrow Hotel?
the one and only Diana followed Taylor's money trail back to him.
that would explain why he's staying at the Withrow Hotel.
well, his passion for baseball raised some eyebrows.
he collects priceless baseball memorabilia.
the Yankees say he's tried to buy some of their most significant pieces over the years.
but they're not willing to sell. Enter Taylor.
exactly. That's Geoffrey, from the Yankees.
why don't you finish your breakfast, then we'll wire you.
Geoffrey, good news.
I never realized how much Peter loves baseball.
well, you know, the Twins drafted him.
wait, he played pro?
he had an amazing slider.
played in the minors right after college.
and two weeks into spring training, I blew out my rotator cuff.
honey, I'm sorry. I thought Neal knew.
it's okay.
I'm gonna finish getting ready. You guys, have a good day.
all right. - Love you.
see you.
so, that's it, huh? You only got to play for two weeks?
I went under the knife, and they were able to repair it.
three months later, I was back in the rotation with the triple-A club.
so you still had the slider?
Yeah, but that was the problem.
I could throw it, but the doctors said if I continued, I'd destroy my arm for good.
that was in my head every time I pitched.
so I left.
I had a choice - I could continue down that path or find a new passion.
it's a tough call to make.
you never look back and wish you played in the majors?
Oh, of course I do.
there's no bigger dream than playing in the show.
standing on that mound, right in the middle of the stadium, listening to the crowd chant your name.
in hindsight, if I'd kept playing, I would have destroyed my arm.
then I never would have been able to pass the FBI physical.
and I never would have caught you.
come on. Time for our show.
Caffrey's anklet's off, he's wired, and inside the billiard room.
Jones, when you played ball, did you ever imagine having walk-out music?
you know, walk-out music, to get the crowd going when you walk out to the mound.
Yeah, I know what it is. I never set my sights that high.
I take it you did.
"I go to work," except it'd be "I go to Burke."
Kool Moe Dee? Really?
Yeah. Yeah. I was a closer."I go to Burke."
that's definitely old-school.
it works. - Yeah, it works.
they're in.
as I of yours.
that thing at the Del Monico a few months back...
was that just Neal, or was it the both of you?
he's not one to brag.
I respect that.
it was me, not him.
looks like our cover story's working.
they think Caffrey was involved with the Del Monico diamond heist.
you know, Kramer actually asked me about it.
he ask you anything about Neal's old prison letters?
Diana said he's sending a team in to scour them for codes.
no, just about Neal's old crimes.
by the end of the conversation, he had me thinking twice over whether we'd be doing the bureau and Caffrey any favors by letting him out early.
Mozzie, they were out of the Gosset Brut, so I had them open a Grand Cuvee '96.
96 Grand Cuvee. My usual.
Neal, I know how much you love the Caspian osetra caviar so they're bringing up an ounce.
much appreciated.
you think this is what his life will be like?
who? Neal?
when his anklet's off.
there is that chance we'll be hearing this same conversation.
Yeah, only then it'll be a lot harder to monitor him.
Yeah. Robert. Let's talk outside.
no, that's nonsense. I wanted to see what my money's bought me.
gentlemen. What's going on?
this is a friend of mine.
I'm your boss. Who are you?
what's going on over there?
this is a jammer.
without it, we only talk about the weather.
every frequency's killed.
we almost had withrow and Taylor on tape.
instead we're out here with nothing.
okay. Here's the deal.
the only thing I know about you guys is that you're a bunch of professional thieves, so I'm sure you won't take it personally when I say that I don't trust any one of you.
but you hired me.
it's my job to deliver on our agreement.
Yeah. And I know that you will, because Paul here's gonna make sure by going with you.
this isn't working for me.
guns get you caught, hurt, 10 to life.
no guns. No outsiders.
it's non-negotiable.
then this is where we part company. No hard feelings.
gentlemen, thank you very much indeed.
I'll be in touch shortly to pay you for your time.
I hope we can work together again soon.
hold on. Hold on. You can't just walk out of here. They know who I am.
that's because you waltzed in here and introduced yourself to everybody.
nobody's leaving.
Robert, please.
if the feds can't hear us, this may turn into the last 10 minutes of a Tarantino film.
if they could hear us, they'd be here already.
Yeah, and we die in a slow-motion hail of bullets while Nancy Sinatra plays ironically in the background.
all right, don't zip up your boots yet, Nancy.
excuse me, gentlemen.
it's all right, Neal. I've got it under control.
understood, but I just had a thought.
it seems to me if Mr. Withrow trusts Paul, then we should trust him, too.
use him as our breaker, so long as he doesn't change the plan.
and Taylor has a good reason for the no-guns rule.
stadium security does not mess around.
we'd need weeks of additional preparation, and even then, it's not worth the risk.
paul joins us, but we leave the weapons here. That's just my two cents.
are you willing to put Paul on your crew?
I've got men on every exit. What now?
keep monitoring from here in case they come back online.
I'm gonna check in with Yankees security to get an op order for today's game.
I have a feeling this is going down soon.
we'll let you know the moment they move.
great.
Yankee stadium. The museum.
what's our target?
george Herman Ruth's first official home run ball, hit against the Yankees on may 6, 1915, at the polo grounds.
it's priceless, not for sale.
Mozzie, you're first up. How'd the hunt go?
Oh, good. This ball is from 1921.
excellent. Your job will be to detail this to perfection.
Neal, how's the Babe Ruth signature?
he couldn't tell us apart.
that's what I like to hear. When Mozzie's finished, you sign the ball.
then at the stadium, you make the switch.
they're gonna catch on it's a forgery.
Yeah, Neal's right - I can make this passable, but an expert will nix this on closer observation. Exactly.
we want them to know that it's stolen, just after we're gone.
duran, you're gonna play lookout while Smitty sets up the video feed.
paul - Trustworthy Paul - You now have the most important job.
you'll pretend to admire the Babe Ruth ball...
smash the glass...
...and run away, leaving the ball there.
security will pursue.
that would be me.
and Neal will switch out the real ball for the fake ball.
and meet me in the upper-deck hallway in a camera-blind spot to make the pass.
and then you'll give me the ball at parking k-5.
exactly. Neal... Nice watch.
thank you.
take it off.
you're a security guard. They don't wear $5, 000 watches.
in fact, all of you, cellphones, watches, communication devices in the bucket.
from now on, no outside contact.
thanks for the update, Diana.
Kramer's people are here. I wasn't invited in.
you let me know if you hear anything.
Peter , I've got the op order. They've approved two additional teams.
all right. Great. If we don't hear from Caffrey in two hours, we move in.
Yes, sir.
is this a bad time?
what's up?
I've made a decision.
the burnt amber is calibrated ever so slightly warm.
Oh, here. Practice.
I need to get a message to Peter .
he's inspiring, Neal.
he's skilled, strategic, magnanimous...
commutation, Moz.
I thought a lot about what you said, and I want to testify on his behalf.
okay. The cost of freedom.
what do you want the note to say?
I'll hide it under the stitching.
we talked. A lot.
and... While he is never going to be a model citizen, he's also not the brazen thief that he was six years ago when I went after him for that Raphael.
excuse me. - Yeah.
Yeah, Jones. What's up?
tail them and stay low. I'm on my way.
what's going on?
Neal's about to rob Yankee Stadium.
gather 'round, gentlemen. It's game time.
I want to see this ball that I'm paying for.
I don't want any of you walking out with the real one when I'm stuck with the fake.
let's see.
of course.
fingerprints. Come right over there.
if they find Peter 's note, then cue up Nancy Sinatra.
it's good.
wait, what's this?
the two red stitches in a row.
uh, t-that's for your benefit.
it'll fool most of the experts, and of course it's not on the real ball.
so you'll be able to tell the difference.
nice work, Mozzie.
I knew you were the man for the job.
all right, gentlemen. Let's go.
Hi, Peter . game on.
Diana, I'm at the stadium. What's our status?
we got this place covered.
any sign of Taylor and his crew?
they're here, used the V.I.P. entrance.
Taylor and Mozzie are holed up in the delta suite.
is Withrow with them?
negative. We believe he's still at the hotel.
what about Neal and the others?
they spread out in the crowd.
geoffrey's got extra men at every hot point we identified, so as soon as they surface, we got 'em.
all right. I'll meet you in five.
right on schedule.
they may be on to us.
looks like there's additional security.
guess we'll have to give them someone to catch.
batter up.
Hey! Stop right there! Get him!
I confess. I confess.
we've got a vandal in the museum. Secure the room.
no, no. I got it. You guys can take him in.
all right, everybody. Clear out of here, please. Okay? Can you back up?
thank you.
looks like he broke clean through the glass.
get everybody out of here.
runners on the corners.
like clockwork.
I have to tell you, Mr. Taylor, this is a first-class operation from top to bottom.
well, you and Neal are a pleasure to work with.
you're not having nearly enough fun, Mozzie.
I cloak anxiety with indifference and reserved chatter.
you know, I might have some work coming up later in the summer.
how do you feel about Paris?
J'adore Paris, mon frere.
good. Good.
you're up.
I don't know anything about any heist!
last chance. You sure?
I accidentally bumped into the case.
get him out of here.
well, he's got to be the decoy.
this just doesn't add up. I mean, why didn't he take the ball?
because he left it for someone else to take.
I want to see the ball that's in that case now.
all right.
I'm on deck. - Okay. Good luck.
Thanks. See you around.
agent Berrigan, someone's approaching the suite.
description?
5'10," brown hair, slender build, wearing a jacket and cap.
moving in now.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
false alarm.
they just don't have the bats to put runs on the board.
come on, Peter .
what do you make of that?
the pattern on the stitching's off.
Yep. It's supposed to consistently alternate red, blue, red, blue.
this patch here, it's red and red.
is that a common mistake?
no. But I'll have to check this ball's documentation.
you know, it's nearly 100 years old.
that'll take too long.
what are you doing?
bear with me.
wait!
I can't believe you did that.
thank you, Neal.
we don't have much time. Come on.
Caffrey took a real chance writing a message in that ball.
Neal may be the expert in spotting forged paintings and bearer bonds - And gems. - Antiquities, counterfeit money.
pretty much any kind of document.
anyway, baseball's my thing.
there's Withrow.
there it is. Go. Go.
FBI! Hands in the air!
I was just scalping tickets.
Taylor, turn around slowly.
I'll take that.
Hey, now. Careful with that thing, man. It's priceless.
Yeah, it's gonna cost you four to six years.
I have a well-maintained reputation as a crook.
make my arrest look real.
say "ow." - ow!
Where's Taylor?
he called an audible and sent us instead.
did Neal tip him off?
now, that's an ungrateful thank-you from the cynical eyes of the law.
have you ever considered there are some criminals who are too smart to get caught?
no.
pig!
what are you doing, Moz?
pantomiming his wholly unexpected capture, I'm sure.
it's not just the New York summer heat. The air thickens when things don't feel right.
Mozzie said something, didn't he?
everyone gets paid.
always on my team.
I hope this little operation of yours has built up enough good will that you'll be joining Mozzie in Paris in a few months.
you still think I'm a thief?
fish don't do well out of water.
agent Berrigan, I think you should take a look at this.
Neal coded his letters.
and we cracked it.
don't know what they mean yet, but we will.
they cracked Neal's letter code to Kate.
this isn't good.
coming.
thought we were meeting at the office.
can I come in? - Sure. Come on in.
you okay? You seem a little tense.
Yeah, just got some things on my mind... One of which is Taylor.
how do you think he got away?
he runs a pretty good game.
he does. You want to know what I think?
sure.
he's not the most brilliant criminal, and his thefts aren't high-tech.
but he knows people.
I think he charmed Mozzie, the same way he does everybody else, and in the end, Mozzie liked him too much to see him get caught.
that's one theory.
but you got Withrow.
and you saved the baseball.
which reminds me, I got something for you.
you sure you're okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
get ready.
what?
that's my rookie card. - Sure is.
you know, I got to say, knowing you played pro ball,
I don't know, made me see you in a whole new light.
Really? - Yeah.
there's a lot more to Peter Burke than I know.
how did you get this?
I have my ways.
I got something else for you, too, for saving a piece of baseball history.
come on. You're gonna love it.
can I keep this? - Sure.
not that expensive.
how did you arrange this?
I have my ways.
you ready? - yep.
let's go to burke.
I'm standing on the pitcher's mound... in Yankee Stadium.
I know.
thank you.
why didn't you tell me you played pro?
there are things in the past that live in the past.
not my life anymore.
some of the things we've done are pretty hard to forget.
honestly, Peter ...
...do I have a shot at commutation?
you know, the one thing that I took away from my injury is that, on days like this, don't worry about the future or the past.
enjoy the moment?
Yeah.
got some sauce on it!
I moved your portion of the treasure out of the country.
it's still worth more than either of us could ever spend in a lifetime.
I don't want to run anymore, Moz.
I'm -- agent Kramer.
head of the bureau's d. c. art crimes unit
so you're the one who taught Peter everything he knows.
Neal's my c. i. - he's also a friend.
the u. s. probation office is convening a hearing to discuss the commutation of your sentence.
you could be a free man.
you've already served two years of a four-year sentence while confined to a tracking anklet.
I won't be going anywhere anytime soon.
this is my home now.
Caffrey's got a lot of secrets.
but if I keep digging, who knows what will turn up?
if Kramer digs up these things -- Neal could get the maximum.
he could go back to prison.
for a long, long time.
you're covering for him.
you box him in, he's gonna run.
these marshals are here to take Neal Caffrey into custody, and he'll work for me in d. c. permanently.
you understand this is best for everyone, don't you?
I do know that he has a good heart.
do you think Mr. Caffrey is reformed?
as long as he's on that anklet, we'll never know.
as long as we treat him like a criminal, he'll always think that he is one.
should Neal Caffrey's sentence be commuted?
Yes. Neal should be free.
I'm saying Neal should be free.
I can tell you one thing -- I won't be going anywhere anytime soon.
Peter, Caffrey's cut his anklet.
Neal's gone.
that person you saw on Roosevelt island -- who was it?
E. Parker, witness protection.
when this is over, I'll tell you everything.
Kramer thinks you know more than you're saying.
world's greatest FBI agent
until the dust settles, keep your head down, close some cases, and forget about Neal Caffrey.
What'd you bring me?
work-up on another mail fraud.
foreign lottery?
magazine sweepstakes.
Oh, variety -- spice of life.
is this where Caffrey sat?
who's that at Neal's desk?
no idea.
well, it looks like he knows you.
he's got quite the swagger, doesn't he?
you didn't blink first, did you?
no, I didn't.
I've been invited to the party.
Peter, this is agent Kyle Collins.
he's with o. i.a.
what brings the office of international affairs to white collar?
it's been six weeks, and the bureau hasn't turned up one lead on its poster boy for reform, which is why Caffrey needs to be captured and locked away for a long, long time.
as you're aware, we've got agents flipping over every mattress Caffrey's ever slept on.
but those other agents aren't Peter burke.
I've given my statements. Everything I know about Neal is in the file.
everything that's official, maybe.
but agent Kramer seems to think that you may have left out the good stuff.
Kramer sent you.
you know, he shed quite a bit of light on your relationship with Caffrey.
agent Collins, if burke says it's all there, it's all there.
Neal Caffrey has 27 known aliases, "speaks eight languages, "including conversational swahili.
he'd avoid countries with extradition.
that's helpful.
he has a weakness for beautiful women and." i love this bit of in sight.
he runs. - Yes, he does.
are we done here?
no. Agent burke, I'm gonna find Neal Caffrey.
and you're gonna help me do it.
buenos dias, Rodrigo.
Sr. Maine!
est? Listo?
Listo. Sr. Maine.
est? Listo.
thank you.
here you go.
thank you very much.
Hey, you didn't pay for that!
here. For his payas, Hector.
Oh, thank you, se? Or.
see you in a little bit, buddy.
okay.
pardon, uh, usted conoce "mi valero"?
s?
Sigueme.
buenos dias, Maya.
Hello, again, new york.
"mi valero." that's the last time I tell you one of my favorites.
that almost sounds like regret -- something you said you didn't believe in.
after a few caipirinhas, I say a lot of things.
Oh, your usual table has ears.
Oh, Barry?
he's harmless.
he wants to unionize my servers.
viva healthcare!
more or less harmless.
say yes to dinner tonight.
I'm sorry. I have to work.
you're the proprietor.
I like you, James.
I do. But men like you are trouble.
men like me?
men who come here to escape their past.
I think you're confusing me with the guy who steals Hector's payas.
and if you are, I'm offended.
Estoy tambien.
so you're an honest man who has nothing to hide.
open book.
you're from new york.
that's all you've told me.
it's the best city in the world.
then why'd you leave?
to live here. In paradise.
I'm sorry, new york.
your open book is a work of fiction.
Maya, come on.
one moment of honesty.
that's all I'm asking.
maybe then I'll consider dinner.
if it isn't Barry Soetoro -- carefree treasure hunter.
just so I'm clear, you can have any woman you want, and the one woman you choose is the only woman in the entire archipelago who doesn't want you.
you have your pursuits, I have mine.
well, she has no reason to assume we're hiding anything.
except the fact that this island has no U.S. extradition treaty and we showed up with limitless wealth.
the NEW YORK TIMES
you miss it?
of course.
but what's regret gonna get me?
nothing.
and you're James Maine -- rich, carefree island resident.
Neal Caffrey, on the other hand, is -- is a wanted fugitive.
too bad the FBI won't forget that.
you think he's in milos?
Sparta, maybe?
you know, there's nothing in his file about an affinity for greek philosophy.
cause you're not gonna find Neal studying trinkets.
and why is that?
he disappears through reinvention.
the man you're looking for isn't the one who sat at that desk.
the day Caffrey fled, you said you followed him to Roosevelt island.
you claimed you didn't know why he was there or who he met with, and yet you had agent Clinton jones flag the name e. Parker, but you failed to mention the part about e. Parker in any of your official statements.
we couldn't confirm the details.
you tried to go through witsec?
no help.
I'll let you know if that's true.
did you leave out anything else?
he likes tanduay rum.
Nope. I've got people on the ground in the Philippines.
then clearly you know more than I do.
Aw, that's a shame.
I liked picturing Neal and Moz touring the conut palace.
well, if Collins has his way, you can start picturing Neal in sing sing.
that's if he's lucky.
you want me to kick Collins' ass?
six weeks.
six weeks of chasing down leads.
el, he's my responsibility.
if anything were to happen to him. - Honey, Kramer backed you into a corner.
you had to let Neal go. You know that.
Yeah, and now I know that Collins has access to witsec.
he's got a leg up.
you still think this e. Parker knows where Neal went?
my gut's telling me that parker is the key to all of this.
and you don't think you can get to parker first?
no.
you know, but maybe I could come in a close second.
by following Collins.
Yeah, if parker knows where Neal is, maybe I can warn him that Collins is coming.
well, that's a big "if." - yeah. Right now that's all I have.
and if all else fails, you can kick Collins' ass.
you know, most normal people make sand castles out of sand.
when have you ever considered us normal people, Moz?
your point?
language is fluid.
so is your linen shirt.
all right. You mind hanging out while I change?
or I could go meet Dobbs by myself, save you the trouble.
we're paying the guy 25 grand a month for safe haven.
I think that's earned me some face time.
as you know, i vetted a lot of locations for our final refuge, and with our very specific demands for lifestyle and security, it's a short list.
big enough to blend in, small enough to limit exposure.
I know, Moz.
if we cross Dobbs in any way, our only other option is isla paradiso.
sounds nice.
it's a leper colony!
and contrary to popular opinion, I do not have the compassion of Jesus.
I'll be a saint.
Oh, I got this for Dobbs.
and this would be?
Oh, a good first impression.
it looks like Dobbs is doing okay for himself.
he's got the whole island wired.
clearly.
she's beautiful.
this one took me almost a year.
half the challenge is finding materials this far from the mainland.
Mr. Dobbs, I'd like to introduce you to my associate, James Maine.
Mr. Maine. The names we choose can be very telling.
where does yours come from?
the u. s.Maine. - Didn't the Maine shipwreck in rough seas?
suffice it to say, it wasn't a planned retirement.
thought you might appreciate a new canvas.
look at this.
dimple whiskey.
1935.0
not easy to come by in these parts.
how'd you find it?
well, how we emptied it is the better story.
I'm sure it is.
I assume you have something else for me?
built all these yourself?
I've been on this island almost 20 years.
it's important to have hobbies.
well, I have to admit, I don't know much about ships in bottles.
well, planning is critical.
when all the pieces are set, it only takes one pull of the string to bring them to life.
but if all the pieces aren't perfectly linked together
it all collapses.
I've heard this story before.
paradise comes at a price, Mr. Maine.
you pull the strings.
and I keep everything tied together.
please have a seat.
25 grand - what assurances does this guarantee us?
it assures you the local law enforcement won't divulge your presence here, nor will they hassle you.
if you have any disputes, problems, issues, bring them to me.
extradition or not, this money guarantees that we stay invisible to the outside world.
that's right.
I only ask that you respect the sanctity of the island.
and if I have concern, I come to you.
anytime, day or night.
but I doubt he'll have any. - But I do.
please don't. - There's a boy in town -- Hector.
he runs a fruit stand.
one of your men has been taking his payas without paying for them.
from now on, Brody will pay for his papayas.
and the ones he's already taken?
I'll see to it the boy is compensated.
all right. Then I think we will be very happy here.
excellent.
Payas? Seriously?
it's about justice, Moz.
and if a certain cafe Girl gets wind of your little good deed?
added bonus.
just so you know, Hector makes a killing off that fruit stand.
think about that the next time you give me an embolism.
gentlemen. It's been a pleasure.
perfect timing.
Collins is in there now.
E. Parker?- Female. Mid to late-50s.
What'd you bring me?
deviled ham.
Oh, Neal hated this.
that's because he had a nose.
what? - Nothing.
Oh, stakeouts with Neal were the worst.
how so?
well, he'd -- he'd always want to listen to public radio or talk about chiaroscuro in roman imperial manuscripts.
you miss him.
Yeah. Yeah, right.
especially the way he'd run off after I told him not to.
Oh, drove me crazy.
you know, if it makes you feel better, I could come up with an excuse to get out of the car and go eavesdrop on Collins by.
I don't know, zip-lining across the drainage pipe with grappling hooks made out of expensive Forzieri ties.
it might make me feel a little better.
you're the best wife ever. You know that.
look at that.
rejected.
man on deck.
actually, I was on deck.
now I'm up to bat, technically.
right. The best wife ever would have known that, wouldn't she?
she would. - Good luck.
Thanks.
ms. Parker, my name is Peter burke. I was
I know who you are, and I've already told your partner I've got nothing to say.
agent Collins and I aren't partners.
I'm Neal's friend.
you need something more original than good cop/bad cop.
I've played that game myself, and you're not very good at it.
no, I'm trying to help him.
were you trying to help him when you locked him up the first time?
I was, but that -- then I'm pretty confident he doesn't want your help now.
ms. Parker, I don't think you understand what -- no.
come, misses! This way!
where are we going, Hector?
surprise.
don't tell me the guy who steals Hector's payas offers you wine and chocolate.
out of nowhere, he paid Hector back today.
I wonder if you have anything to do with that.
I'm flattered that you think I would.
come on. I'll show you the view.
right this way.
here.
how did you do this?
plaster molds and a lot of sand.
it's the view from my old building.
this is amazing.
Why?
I'll never be an open book, but new york was a pretty big chapter.
are you going to be honest about it?
you asked me for a moment of honesty.
I'm gonna give you 20. - 20?
20 questions.
so generous of you.
well, I'm a generous guy.
ask me anything you want about my life there.
anything? - Anything.
okay. - Honesty.
do you miss it?
every day.
I lived there off and on since I was 18, so.
why did you go there?
I had to leave the place I was from.
where was that?
St. Louis, but that's not a new york question. Tricky.
okay, then, it doesn't count.
all right. Okay.
um. Did you know anyone when you arrived?
not a soul.
who was your first friend?
he doesn't look like a Barry.
do I look like a James?
that's why I call you "new york."
I can live with that.
are you alone? - Yeah.
what's going on.
well, i made a grappling hook out of forzierI ties.
it's you.
call me Ellen.
for the record, your wife does a very good "good cop."
Yes, she does.
Ellen. We need to talk about Neal.
he doesn't know it yet, but he needs our help.
I'm curious.
what exactly did Neal tell you about me?
nothing.
not even a name.
you were Neal's father's partner.
you talk the talk.
partners are like family. That's it, isn't it?
agent burke, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm in witsec for a good reason.
I'm not so sure this was a good idea.
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.
I gave Neal the signal to run.
the day of his commutation hearing, the day he would have gone free, an agent with a grudge decided Neal didn't deserve that freedom, so he was gonna be hauled off for life.
prison. An anklet in d. c.-- something that he didn't deserve.
so I gave him the signal to run.
you set him free?
and now he's out there somewhere.
and the other agent who came to you -- agent Collins?
he won't stop. Until he brings Neal back
alive or. Or otherwise.
Ellen, if anything were to happen to him, I.
I don't think I could live with it.
I sent Neal out into the world once.
told him a truth he wasn't ready to handle.
six years ago, when the feds were closing in on him, Neal and I exchanged pagers.
in case something happened, we'd use them like emergency flares.
Ellen, you won't regret this.
protect our boy.
Ellen? - Hi, Neal.
guess this makes you 3 and 0.
2 and 1.
haven't found you yet.
Ellen gave you the pager number?
Yeah. Yeah, she sends her best.
I'm sure.
what do you know?
Neal, the d. o.j. has got someone looking for you.
well, if they didn't, I'd be insulted.
he means business.
"he" meaning "you"?
no. - Then I'm not worried.
how bad did I leave things for you?
eh, the bureau beat me up a little, but I'm handling it.
and Elizabeth?
she's good.
the agent who is after you, his name is Collins.
he's with the office of international affairs.
he's dangerous.
and he won't stop until he finds you.
I'm safe here.
and I'm happy.
we had a good run.
it's not over.
Yeah, it is.
you're an FBI agent. I'm a con man.
there are only a few ways this could have ended.
this is one of the best.
right.
you understand this has to be the last time.
new york and I are done.
I get it. Please watch out for Collins.
I will.
it's good to hear your voice.
Yeah. You too.
goodbye, Peter. - Goodbye, Neal.
thanks for coming. Any sign of Collins?
not since yesterday.
my friend in Quantico slipped the recording to the digital evidence exploitation unit.
she isolated three distinct background elements of Neal's call.
listen.
church bells. - Four in a row.
there's more.
ocean tides. Rhythmic.
they were audible during the call.
listen to that fourth wave again.
it's off rhythm. - It's not a wave. It's thunder.
all right. We've got church bells and a storm.
it's a start, right?
all right. I'll make the coffee.
Bienvenue. - Bienvenue.
I did some precursory digging into this Collins.
What'd you find?
well, think dog the bounty hunter, sans the bleached mullet and bel esprit.
seems he'd rather bring home his captures in body bags than not at all.
the call was untraceable.
the beeper and the burner phone are in the bottom of the Atlantic - it's done.
you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure, Moz.
good.
vitamin C.
morning.
you're up.
can I get you some breakfast?
Thanks. I should get over to the caf
can I see you tonight?
I'd like that very much.
see you, Barry.
setting down roots.
spicy ones at that. I support this.
a hard beginning makes a good ending.
I'll have Hector keep an eye out for Collins, just to be safe.
to good endings.
Yes. Good endings.
the call came in at midnight.
the bells rang four times.
let's assume it was 4: 00 p. m. where Neal was.
vanuatu -- waves, churches, no extradition - it works.
Ah, it's no good.
the only storm activity at 4: 00 p. m. in utc plus-11 occurred up near Vladivostok, Russia.
Yeah, Mozzie is afraid of bears.
let's try 4: 00 a. m. - a little early for church.
no, not necessarily.
I served my tour near a Chamorro village in Guam.
local chapel had a 4: 00 a. m. service for the fishermen who went out before dawn.
puts him in utc minus-1.
cape Verde islands.
no extradition.
isolated thunderstorms throughout the Atlantic, but, i mean, there must be dozens of tiny islands.
Diana, what about the bells?
well, analysis says they were Spanish brass, but the islands in that area were colonized by Portugal, not Spain.
dead end. We need Spanish bells.
wait a second. I think I may have something.
in 1798, a bell was dredged from the wreckage of a Spanish ship named the Trinidad.
it was hung in the church of st. Christopher in the port city of Santa Maria on the northernmost coast of Cape Verde.
and you got to love the internet, because I have a tourist video with the bells ringing.
Diana? - Already on it
Yes!
Oh, you got to love the sound of Spanish brass!
we got him!
what now?
go back to the office and figure out a way to bring Neal home.
Yes. - Agent Collins.
uh, my husband's actually at the office.
I know.
well, then, what are you doing here?
my job. - You can't just walk in like this.
does agent Hughes know about this?
he will.
I'm calling my husband.
sir, take a look at this.
no need to bother your husband, Mrs. Burke.
I found what I was looking for.
Collins was in my house.
he had absolutely no right to be there.
he had every right.
you were withholding information on Caffrey's whereabouts.
I was speculating on my free time.
I saw the map.
you circled Cape Verde.
is he there? - I don't know.
I think so.
Collins?
he was on the first flight to Cape Verde.
does he have jurisdiction?
no.
then how do you think he's gonna bring Neal back?
Caffrey's fate is out of your hands, Peter.
I don't accept that. - Well, you better.
pending review of the situation, I've been instructed to put you on leave.
do yourself a favor.
use this time to get some perspective.
think about what's important.
if you decide it's Caffrey. I understand, but I can't protect you.
do you understand?
completely.
Sr. Maine, Sr. Sutolo!
I think I saw that man at the aeropuerto!
he fit the description?
solo Americano in a diplomatic line.
had very small luggage.
tiene su la foto?
Yes, yes. I have one.
this sure looks like his file photo.
how did he find us?
Peter said he was good.
good work, Hector. - Thank you.
keep eyes.
okay. I keep eyes.
thank you, Hector. - Don't worry.
we have maybe 24 hours.
what do you want to do?
what choice do I have?
this island's burned.
Collins is making his way to Santa Maria.
we're on borrowed island time.
say goodbye to the last traces of James Maine.
even though they're forgeries, this still hurts.
I really thought I was done running this time.
we should get to the airport.
Collins is only after me.
you don't have to go.
you run, I run.
that's the deal.
then let's run.
pardon. Como puedo llegar a Santa cristobale - Ah, se. The churche. - Se, the church.
muchas gracias.
Hola. - Buenos días，Sr .
are you looking for a particular type of hat?
Oh, no.
actually, I'm, uh -- I'm looking for a friend.
see Sr. Maine.
Yes, see Sr. Maine. Yes.
skinny brim, about 25 vueltas, classic ribbon.
Ah, Sr. Maine loves the classics.
do you know where I can find him?
he also loves coffee.
come.
you see?
coffee. His biggest weakness.
gracias.
you have a good day, sir.
so, what brings you to the island?
I'm looking for a friend.
dark hair, I think blue eyes.
he's annoyingly persuasive.
maybe you've seen him.
mm, nope.
it's Collins!
1899/12/31 0: 12: 00
has he done something?
not at all.
I owe him an apology.
it's a long way to come to say you're sorry.
he's a good friend. He's worth it.
well, looky here. Agent burke.
never mind. I'm sure you haven't seen him.
I wonder.
what could you be doing so far from home on a tiny island?
I imagine the same thing that brought you here.
getting the best orange juice for the price.
you know, it took me a day to find Caffrey's island hangout.
What'd it take you -- five minutes?
something like that.
the suit's here with island suit.
it's a double-barreled suit.
that's how Collins found us.
no. No. They're not working together. They can't be.
you're good, burke.
I'll give you that.
but I haven't played my trump card.
damas y caballeros. Your attention, please.
what the hell are you doing?
you may know this man as James Maine. His real name is Neal Caffrey.
con man, art thief, forger, fugitive.
we have to go now.
it won't work, Moz. They're not gonna give me up.
I'm offering $500, 000 American for the capture of this man.
you bring him to me, and the money's yours.
unless they're paid to.
take a good look at that.
all right?
now, take a good look at his face.
I don't care what condition you bring him to me. Just bring him to me.
Collins, what's that about?
we all have our methods.
were you ordered to bring him back alive or just bring him back?
Oh, I'm sorry, did I not specify "alive"?
go ahead. Arrest me, agent.
Oh, that's right. You can't. You have no jurisdiction here.
neither do you.
that's why I need the help of these good people.
that's my wallet, kid!
Hey, if you need cash, I know how you could make half a million!
no, no.
you know, I used to take pride in being able to steal your wallet.
but if a kid can do it.
how are you, Peter?
all right.
damn good to see you.
you too.
look, Neal, i -- awfully convenient, suit.
Neal calls you, and the next day you're sharing pie A coladas with the super-suit on our island?
it was the only way I could warn you.
Collins is dangerous.
we noticed.
he's turned half the island against us.
which is why we need to get out of here as soon as possible.
all right. The airport's burned.
they'll be looking for us there.
then by sea it is.
my associate Lorenzo has a charter boat.
can his silence be bought?
Oh, please. I officiated his daughter's wedding.
he can drop us over here.
Nitsae island.
we can lay low there for a week or two.
Yeah, then what?
I do know a place -- upside, beautiful black sand beaches.
downside? - Lepers.
welcome to paradise.
all right, listen. Word is spreading with every passing minute.
we have to move now.
VAMANOS.
did you -- I did.
didn't take long.
nice shot, Cassius clay.
it'll be easier on my own.
I'll meet you at the wharf.
no, it's too dangerous.
worst case, I'll hide out somewhere, meet you before dawn.
Neal, the suit isn't wrong.
can't you just say I'm right?
rather not!
are you sure you're gonna be safe here tonight?
Yeah, if Dobbs gives me protection, I can head to the docks after sundown.
look, I know i promised you I wouldn't bring trouble.
thank you for being an open book, new york.
it was a fun read.
actually, it's Neal.
be safe, Neal Caffrey.
go.
James, come in.
is everything okay?
you said to come to you anytime, day or night, right?
I did.
have a seat. Let me get you a drink.
what's going on?
I need an escort off the island.
really, Lorenzo?
we ate conch together.
does that mean nothing?
that's my price for transport, Sr. Soetoro.
take it or leave it.
fine. Take.
but this is highway robbery -- by sea.
seaway robbery!
that went well.
well, we have our way off the island.
now all we need is our half-a-million-dollar man.
I'm sure he's on his way.
or there's the worst case.
right.
this may be a long night.
it's almost sundown.
with your men's protection, I think it's safe enough -- transport's still en route.
what's your rush?
thank you again for all your help.
it's what you pay me for, isn't it?
keep the local government out of your hair.
Oh, but wait - this wasn't the local government, was it?
it was the united states government.
on my island.
I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.
and yet you did, Neal.
you did.
thankfully, I've made a few calls and cleaned up your mess.
I never told you my name was Neal.
but I did.
Hello, Neal.
these marshals are here to take neal caffrey into custody.
I gave neal the signal to run.
you set him free?
if anything were to happen to him, I don't think I could live with it.
agent burke, i'mgoingto find neal caffrey.
and you're gonna help me do it.
the agent who is after you, his name is collins.
and he won't stop until he finds you.
he's dangerous.
paradise comes at a price.
and if I have a concern, I come to you.
anytime, day or night.
then I think we will be very happy here.
Caffrey's fate is out of your hands.
do you understand?
completely.
I'm looking for a friend.
maybe you've seen him.
has he done something?
you can have any woman you want, and the one woman you choose is the only woman who doesn't want you.
agent burke.
never mind. I'm sure you haven't seen him.
now, I'm offering $500, 000 U. S. for the capture of this man.
I really thought I was done running this time.
you run, I run.
then let's run.
we were supposed to meet neal back at the wharf.
by dawn.
we waited for him all night. He didn't show up.
Neal is well aware he's the island's most wanted.
now, if you had read "team thieving 101..."
that doesn't exist.
...which clearly you have not, you would know you do not leave the set rendezvous point.
and if you read "catching neal caffrey 101,
you should know that, first, you start with the girl.
Orita.
Barry, what are you still doing here?
my nom de plume.
I thought you left with neal last night.
that was the plan. I take it you saw him?
Peter. We met yesterday.
I'm on neal's side.
he is. Back to neal.
he wanted to meet you both, but there were too many people out looking for him, so he went back to dobbs'.
shelter from the storm. Our resident protector on retainer.
he went there for cover?
he didn't intend to spend the night.
he's probably still there.
thank you.
will you let me know when you find him?
Yeah, of course.
one thing I know about neal -- He knows how to run.
see? Just as we left him.
two more hours, Caffrey.
then it's only a short flight to the canary islands and an easy ride home.
here.
I came to you for help, Dobbs.
I don't know why. I wouldn't harbor a fugitive.
I paid you.
to help establish yourself on the island.
you never said the U. S. Government was looking for you.
you should get that fixed.
I told you I didn't want him here.
Caffrey, you only had to be good for a couple of hours, and as long as you got two good legs, you're gonna find a way to run.
you're a federal agent.
you were in the act of fleeing.
you could be armed.
God!
no more running, Caffrey.
I'm assuming big brother didn't give you full access to their keyhole satellite footage.
this trip doesn't have big brother's blessing.
looks like they're setting up a party.
dobbs' monthly island-wide fete.
it's where dobbs distributes his payola to the island officials.
quite the island you've chosen for yourself.
look, suit, I-I need to ask you something.
once we get off this island, hypothetically, what are your exact intentions with neal?
let's find neal.
then we'll deal with the rest of this.
Moz, 11 o'clock.
Collins.- best case
Collins got a tip, and dobbs is hiding neal inside.
Yeah, worst case, dobbs turned him over.
how much protection money do you pay dobbs?
apparently, not enough.
all right, eventually, they're gonna have to bring neal out if they want to catch the next flight out of here.
that's when we make our move.
Ohh, god.
almost got it.
there.
how bad is it?
the bullet lodged in the vastus lateralis, the thigh muscle next to the bone.
no arteries were hit.
that sounds promising.
you gonna sterili-- okay.
it's gonna hurt for a few weeks, but you'll heal up fine.
look away. Focus on the boats.
Claudia, annette... What are you saying?
I'm admiring your boats.
stand up.
Collins is waiting for you outside.
thank you, doctor.
Oh, god.
stay off your feet. I mean it.
do not put any pressure on it, or that wound will open up again.
well, that's gonna be a little tricky.
you want me to walk to the car?
believe me, it's the last time i'll ask for your help.
good.
you didn't have to turn me in.
I just needed to camp out for a couple hours till I could make it to the docks.
this isn't a halfway house. You jeopardized me, my home.
how much did they offer you?
I don't need money.
no. No, you need the U. S. Law enforcement out of your hair.
Why?
they're looking for you, not me.
let's give them what they want.
Oh, god.
there's neal, and he's zip-tied to the dash.
and there's collins. They're hitting the road.
you sure this plan of yours will stop him?
does a wine have tannins?
what is this?
don't look at me.
I've been stuck in a cell, shot, and tethered to a dashboard.
come on!
look, those mangos aren't gonna move themselves.
I'm happy to lend a hand if you'd
don't make me shoot you again.
get that cart out of the road!
what is this? Endale!
excuse me, sir, are you yelling at these children?
stay out of it.
you're not from here, are you?
well, show some decency.
help clean it up.
come on, let's get this stuff out of the road. Come on. I got a plane to catch.
I hope you're planning on paying this kid for so
sir!
here, help me with these watermelons.
what took you so long?
got caught in traffic.
I got a car parked a block from here. We're gonna have to move quick.
Yeah, quick may be a problem.
you're shot?
Oh, Neal, I expected you to be mobile.
well, collins thought ahead.
come on already!
sir, there's a lot of fruit here.
avocado.
maybe I should call it. - hey, there's still some mangoes by the tire.
what? No. No, I'm not going back to prison. Let's go.
you're okay? - yes!
all right. What's the plan?
the marina -- I have access to a yacht.
I stole the keys to dobbs' boat.
I don't think he'll mind.
we'll have to text mozzie.
he hates it when you deviate from the plan.
and he really hates it when I drive his car.
all right, I'll drive.
almost done.
all right, get it off the road! Move!
Hey, caffrey!
Hector, muy bien.
do you know which one is his?
Nope.
you ditched me.
you stole my car.
I had to take a taxi here. That wasnotthe plan.
what happened to you?
I got shot.
welcome to the club.
it's good to be a member.
and I'm fine. Thank you.
we need to find dobbs' boat.
Oh, well, the middle one doesn't have deep-sea-fishing mounts, and dobbs went out last week.
scratch the middle. That leaves us about a dozen.
the model boats in dobbs' library -- they all had women's names.
Yeah, there was, um, claudia, annette, adele...
Isabella, I can tell-a esmerelda, find adele
a peter, this is not the time. - what?
mirabella, so compella was there amirabella?
Yeah.
Rob's fair ladies - did he get into the rum?
I don't know. - These were the names of dobbs' boats?
Yeah. How'd you know that?
who cares? Why did you just defile a nursery rhyme?
forget the boat.
I think I have a way to get you back to new york.
I'm telling you, it's robert macleish.
Oh, come on, peter.
you spot a few boat names and you expect me to believe
I know it sounds crazy.
well, you're damn right it does.
macleish has been at the top of the most wanted for 20 years, and in all that time, no one's seen him.
because he's been here -- on an island off the radar with no extradition.
I'm looking at caffrey's sketch.
it looks as much like macleish as my cousin phyllis.
because he's had major reconstructive surgery.
listen to yourself.
you're not this man, peter. You're grasping at straws, and you know it.
he's here, Reese.
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to give me more to go on than a few women's names.
Hey, peter, if you can get us a photo, we can run it through biometrics.
working on that now.
but assuming it's him -- well, that's a big assumption.
if it's him, what is he worth to the bureau?
what are you suggesting?
if caffrey catches him -- Caffrey?!
Yes. If caffrey catches him and delivers him to you, would justice agree to let him return to new york and reinstate his old deal?
back on his anklet, working cases?
Yes. Working for me.
Oh, my god. Well, that's a hell of a tall order.
I know.
first, prove it's macleish.
if it's him, i'll run it by justice, but no promises.
Yes!
Thanks, Reese.
and, Peter, next time, take me off speaker.
I didn't think he'd go for it.
Yeah. Well... I got a promise on a maybe.
but you're giving me a chance.
Moz, you get the photos of dobbs?
uploading.
Isabella, I can tell-a esmerelda, find adele
a stays in your head.
it's driving me insane!
was this like some government experiment in tune implantation?
macleish is a required first-year case at quantico.
the fbi pursued him through a list of many women in his life.
the names of these women were on a test.
the song's a mnemonic device to rember the names.
but the fbi never found him.
so it's like an exercise in harmonic futility, much like "the macarena.
Yeah, well, we came close with mirabella, but he wised up.
or so you thought.
Yeah.
the girl always gives you away.
feels a little long for biometrics.
a little too long.
before we take this further, suit, I need to clear the air here.
Moz -- I-I know.
but he traveled halfway around the world on an unsanctioned manhunt to track us down.
and now he's trying to move heaven and earth to bring you back to new york.
I think we deserve to know why.
I suspected you having the art from the u-boat, and I brought in kramer to help me prove it.
you had every right to.
I know. I did.
but... Kramer crossed the line.
he crossed the line, peter. You didn't.
Neal, you'll be running forever.
but bringing home macleish -- this is a way to set things right.
Yes.
thank you.
biometrics matched.
it's macleish.
how do we get him back to the u. S?
without a lot of help from hopalong here.
and considering you don't have the power to extradite...
and you have a target on your back...
and you can't make an arrest or carry a weapon...
okay, you're both equally impotent.
But...we still have options.
if dobbs' power comes from paying off local authorities, what if that goes away?
and he can't pay them off?
we steal back the bribe money.
we let the word spread that he's skipping town with the cash.
his party.
Yes!
everyone he's paying off will be there.
they find out that he's leaving town...
drop in a few key whispers, some damning evidence...
I think we have a plan.
this is sheriff morales. He's a talker, and his word carries a lot of weight.
then he's a good person to start hearing some whispers.
he spends a lot of time at the marina.
great.
and he should see someone fueling dobbs' boat for a long voyage.
here are the keys to theesmerelda.
gas her up and put another 50 gallons in the cabin.
where is Mr. Dobbs' going?
far. That's all I know.
Peter, the party -- How are your mixology skills?
you wantmeto tend bar?
everybody talks to the bartender.
I tapped a keg or two in college.
I'll give you a refresher.
don't forget your garnish, okay?
that's just as important as the pour.
Yep. Yep.
you know, before you pour, add a little flourish to it, you know?
spin it around, throw it in the air.
that's good. - go back to your baseball days.
baseball.
nice. Yeah, that's
we can work on that.
Yeah. For sure.
all right, but what about his regular bartender?
Oh, hemayhave won an all-expense-paid dream vacation that takes place the day of the party.
it could work, but he's not gonna hire me because of my pretty face.
no. But if you got a recommendation from one of the island's top caterers...
Maya?
no. I don't want her involved in this, moz.
what if she's willing to help?
you talked to her?
she's worried about you.
and I'm sure she'll give peter a glowing recommendation.
Neal, this plan sounds incredibly intricate.
it is.
what happens if it doesn't work?
it will.
what if you get caught?
well, then I go to jail for a long, long time.
or worse.
we're gonna stay a step ahead of him.
I wouldn't have asked for your help unless I knew it would work.
you really think dobbs will leave the island for good?
that's what you want, isn't it?
that wasn't the only thing on my list.
we'll make it happen.
I hope your friend is a good bartender.
Neal, do we have bitters?
nice.
Yeah, you'll get it. - yeah.
here you go, moz.
if you can't nail the quality, go for quantity.
he's working on it. - all right.
no, gin. - right.
Yeah, pour it like it's hemingway's last call.
so, that's the equipment to open a safe?
Yeah. Back to why a generous pour is so important he's got a brickman 2-5-10.
you can't crack that, can you? - no.
no, not without heavy equipment and several hours of alone time.
you're gonna have minutes, at best.
look, all the drunken whispers in the world won't matter if it doesn't look like he's made off with their bribe money.
true.
so, how you gonna open the safe and have it empty?
well, we do the next best thing.
what, fake and bake?
what's a fake and bake?
we'll make it look like it's empty.
this frame is larger than I expected.
we'll need to find a way to sneak it into dobbs' library during the party.
how's hector's aim?
gentlemen...
to the island's most wanted.
may they be returned to where they belong.
That'snotan omen.
no. - no.
come out with your hands up!
you're too late.
do you mind?
go, go.
Burke, is he here?
you tell me.
I'm done.
what do you mean you're done?
I came here to convince neal to turn himself in.
meanwhile, you got the wild bunch chasing him down like a dog on the street.
I'm doing my job.
Really?
word around town is that you shot him.
you're a bigger menace to society than he ever was.
Yeah, well, playing by your book only gets you so far.
which is why I booked a 4: 00 flight out of here.
I'm a white-collar agent, not a bounty hunter.
besides, i'm out of vacation days.
it's all yours now!
the bar's open.
buenos deas.
appletini. - appletini.
coming right up.
this is a beautiful party.
Yes. Well, Mr. Dobbs knows how to do it right, doesn't he?
Where's rajulio?
Oh, so sad.
Rajulio -- He has been detained by the american federal agent.
I'm kevin.
thank you.
did you know that rajulio's not here because he's been detained by the feds?
no, no, no, no.
no, you're not supposed to be here until tomorrow.
it's Mr. Dobbs. We rushed the order.
you want to give me a hand here?
there must be some type of mix-up. Mr. Dobbs is entertaining tonight.
Oh, he's having a party? - yes.
no problemo. I'll fix his window before a guest even notices.
eyes on the job.
you want to explain to your boss why he has to pay for this twice?
this window crate is heavy.
no one told me there's a second floor.
here, l-lift from the knees, muchacho.
I'm concerned about your back.
thank you.
por favor.
Cuba libre. - cuba libre. Very good.
what is this about rajulio?
uh, I don't want to get him in trouble.
he's not.
the americans detained him, right?
I'm guessing it's because of all that cash.
Rajulio saw them loading all the money out of the safe into Mr. Dobbs' boat.
well, that's what he said. I-I don't know.
what can I get you?
whiskey, please.
Salud. - salud, sir.
something's wrong.
Rajulio saw dobbs' cash.
what's dobbs doing with it?
clear? - clear.
let's see here.
going island hopping?
eh, you been saving that one?
Nope. Just came to me.
all right. We better hurry.
excuse me for a minute.
all right, how does that look?
uh, pretty good.
take a look at the door, will you?
all right.
Oh, just rember -- dobbs is about 3 inches taller than I am.
Yeah, and the sheriff's about an inch shorter. Let's split the difference.
any chance we can really break into the safe and steal the money in the next five minutes?
no.
no, but there's a storage room next door.
I just saw it on the way up. Let's go.
Oh, great.
he didn't leave.
and you were in contact with him, so you know exactly where he is.
are you going to order something?
you do okay here -- I mean, for a woman who's on her own.
I mean, the food is decent.
the service is courteous.
but you could really use some upgrades.
I mean, when was the last time you bought some new glassware?
hell, when was the last time you thought about remodeling?
why would I remodel?
because that's what people do when they come into half a million dollars.
this isn't a good time to talk.
well, whether it's today or tomorrow, neal caffrey will leave you.
he has to.
he's on the run.
he's bad news.
and I want to give you a chance to say when it ends, instead of him.
$500, 000 u. S. - Today, if I capture him.
but tomorrow, if he's already gone, that information is worth nothing.
I know where he is.
Ah, Mr. Dobbs, when do you leave on vacation?
I don't. Who says I did?
Oh, my apologies, sir.
I don't remember his name, but he said you had theesmerelda all gassed up for a long trip.
again, I-I'm sorry.
what can I get you?
Horchata ponche.
what's your name?
Kevin, sir.
Kevin - yes.
first of all, shut up.
second, I'm not going anywhere.
and third... Theesmerelda isnotall gassed up.
Henry, I was at the docks when they fueled up theesmerelda.
no. - yes.
and don't be so hard on kevin, here. He's filling in for rajulio.
who's rajulio?
Rajulio is your regular bartender.
he's being questioned by the feds right now.
about you.
this doesn't make any sense.
why would they talk to my bartender?
because he saw you loading bags of money onto your boat.
what?
you're out of your mind.
okay. Let me get this straight.
the americans are looking into you, you gassed up your boat, and you loaded it with cash?
nothing you've said is true.
except I was at the marina!
I saw them fueling up theesmerelda.
all right.
your money is where it's always been, and I'm not going anywhere.
okay. Prove it.
okay.
you work for Mr. Dobbs, right? - yes
listen, if things get bad for your boss in there,
I heard that one of dobbs' friends had a plane leaving the airport.
you know.
Peter? Showtime.
now, this isn't exactly how we planned our retirement.
Neal, the law on our tail, an ocean breeze, a precision heist from an island overlord.
it kind of is.
you have nothing to worry about.
as you
wait, wait. Wait, wait.
I didn't do this.
you son of a bitch.
you're trying to skip town with our money!
no, no, no, no.
look, I-I'll give you money.
I'll give you more money.
let's see the money.
sheriff! Sheriff morales!
I'm neal caffrey.
I'm the one with the bounty.
I'm the guy you're looking for.
I came to this island for sanctuary, and this man set me up.
Dobbs here loaded all his money -- it's not true.
let him finish!
he loaded his money and his valuables onto theesmerelda and was planning to run while everyone was still looking for me.
you can't possibly be buying this.
he's being hunted by the u. S. Authorities.
well, the bureau changed their target when agent collins discovered who dobbs really is.
who's that?
robert macleish, number four on the fbi's "most wanted" list.
that's a lie. - and now they're after both of us.
get him out of here.
agent collins is at the compound right now. See for yourselves.
get me out of here. We have a deal.
no sudden moves!
everyone stay calm.
let's go, guys.
it's over.
you got me.
move it, caffrey.
everyone has their price.
I hope you get everything you deserve.
I'll think of you with every dollar I spend.
let's go.
we have a plane to catch.
there's macleish. The plan worked.
he thinks collins is afterhim, too.
it's just not his day.
well, he's had more good ones than he deserves.
last chance.
you can grab a free flight back to new york.
no, thanks.
the world beckons.
any particular part?
Seriously?
just don't expect a postcard.
make sure the feds keep the bargain they struck with neal.
he trusts you.
I will.
I know.
look at this, neal.
agent burke's been worried about you.
traveled all the way here and almost didn't get to say goodbye.
good to see you again, peter.
you too.
Congratulations.
you caught him.
plan on taking him back on my charter?
you're not gonna stop me.
no?
you should know who else is on that plane.
what are you trying to pull, burke?
nothing. Henry dobbs is on that plane.
had a feeling he'd be needing a flight.
I don't give a damn about dobbs.
Oh, I think you do, because "dobbs" is an alias.
you probably know him by his real name -- rob macleish.
Dobbs is robert macleish?
the one and only.
you play this right, and you've landed the biggest score of your life.
robert macleish is on this plane, right now?
Yep.
justice department has been fully briefed.
there will be cameras and reporters when we land on the canary islands, which, funny enough, does have extradition.
now, you can say that you had nothing to do with his capture.
why give neal all the credit when we've gone through all this work to include you?
see the part where you, uh, secretly recruited me to help you take down macleish?
that's good thinking.
you set me up. - for the win.
and what do you get out of this, caffrey?
my old desk back.
well, my job was to bring you back.
what happens to you once you're in the system, that's up to the bureau.
don't try it, dobbs.
back away from the door, macleish. No more running.
I'm hauling your ass back to new york.
you hear that?
we're going home.
we're going home.
should be off the cane in a week.
you think so?
maybe. - yeah.
welcome back.
thank you, jones.
thank you both for bringing me back.
you know, I always thought i'dbe the one to shoot you in the leg.
well, there's always next time.
well, I hope you get a "next time.
what he did, he did for peter.
Yeah.
I get that.
looks like you got something special.
aside from the beard.
a letter of appreciation.
I'll have to get it framed.
he's mad because I denied him the reward money for macleish.
a medal would have been nice. That's all I'm saying.
well, you know, speaking of medal, jones -- yeah, caffrey.
you do get a medal.
and the award for the best foreign capture goes to...
may i? - yeah, of course.
comfortable? - yeah.
feels like home.
good.
Oh, don't get up.
I'm fine. It's just annoying.
Oh, it's so good to see you, neal.
you too.
Oh... So, I made the right decision trusting peter.
you've always had a pretty good instinct.
you too.
june said she never even considered renting out your room after you left.
well, she is one of the many reasons that I'm glad to be back.
want to sit down? Can I get you something?
the marshals are shipping me off in a few weeks.
where?
nowhere close, I'm afraid.
there's been too much exposure here.
a few weeks, huh?
both of us get another new start.
Yeah.
I was really hoping we'd have more time together.
me too.
even though I haven't seen you in a few years, you are the closest thing that I have to family.
Oh, that's not true. - You know what I mean.
they don't know about our history.
they don't know about my dad.
they don't need to.
but I do.
that was a long time ago, neal.
there is no reason to go dredging it up again.
everything I grew up believing was wrong.
everything.
and I ran before I got to hear the full story.
I'm not running anymore.
I want to know who he was.
before I leave -- I promise.
you promise?
I promise.
but tonight, tell me about the island.
was there a girl?
Yeah, her, uh -- her name was maya.
you spoke with caffrey on the phone.
you had a map with his location circled on it.
the board wants to know how that came to pass.
Reese, I didn't aid or abet.
I didn't know where he was, so I made the phone call to track him.
Kramer had it out for caffrey, and then you, after you helped him return the raphael.
I know.
Caffrey's case has risen to the level of deputy director and inspector general, and a lot of your work is being put under the microscope.
you were expressly ordered off neal's case.
you broke the rules.
I understand.
and as far as d. C. Is concerned, it was collins who helped caffrey bring home macleish, not you.
now that neal is back, I will make sure that both of us stay on the straight and narrow.
afraid we're past that, peter.
so then maya tells dobbs exactly where we were.
Really? - Yeah. She was in on it.
it was all part of the plan.
everything all right?
no.
I've been reassigned.
what do you mean?
my mom told me he was dead.
but you told me the truth.
he was a dirty cop... And he's not dead.
ms. Parker, you were Neal's father's partner.
that's it, isn't it?
agent Burke, I'm in witsec for a good reason.
these marshals are here to take Neal Caffrey into custody.
he'll work for me in D. C. Permanently.
you broke the rules.
I go back to work, and you're placed under review and reassigned?
I'm sure it's only temporary.
it's the evidence warehouse, and it's the best I could do.
the marshals are shipping me off in a few weeks.
everything I grew up believing was wrong, and I ran before I got to hear the full story.
I want to know who he was.
when my dad went away, Ellen looked after me.
you grew up in witness protection.
I was 3 when the marshals took us away.
what happened?
we found a gun with his prints on it.
he killed a cop?
it was a long time ago.
I need to know who I am.
agent Patterson.
watching you, Caffrey.
always good to see you, sir.
Patterson's not the only one keeping an eye on me.
black-market prosthetics off a raid on the docks.
counterfeit eyeballs. Very rat pack. - Hmm?
Sammy Davis Jr. Had a glass eye.
we got to get you back to white collar.
Oh, tell me about it.
what's in the bag?
Oh, I made a detour on my way to the bank to pick you up Manhattan's best sandwich.
why did you go to the bank?
you don't want to know where I got the sandwich?
marginally less interesting.
first FBI check since I got back.
put it in my rainy-day account.
rainy-day account?
well, with what I get paid, all I can afford is an umbrella.
cute.
good morning.
what can I do for you?
how did you leave things with Sara?
non sequitur. Why?
look behind you.
I'm an insurance investigator with Sterling-Bosch.
I'm here to see agent Burke.
how was your island adventure?
you know, it was kind of like rum punch.
seemed like a good idea at the time un-- until the hangover?
Yeah. - Yeah.
Hi, Peter. - Sara.
what brings you down here?
I'm working the Covington settlement.
hedge funder we targeted during the sweep on insider trading last year.
we were getting close until he died.
scuba diving in the Hamptons.
forfeiture units seized all illegal gains, and we closed the case.
well, I'm cleaning it up on our end.
his death was ruled accidental, so...
the young widow gets the insurance money.
how much? - $50 million.
unless I can prove she doesn't deserve it.
now, the NYPD ruled her out as a suspect, but
you think Sophie Covington pulled one over on everyone?
well, you're the connoisseur on crimes of persuasion.
that's what I want you to tell me.
and you're the expert on the case.
now, there's a memorial at 1: 00 marking the anniversary of Covington's death.
who's up for a stakeout?
Neal has errands to run, but that doesn't mean you can't pick my brain over Manhattan's best sandwich.
then i'll take over.
fill in. - Fill in.
thank you.
60 minutes, Burke.
great.
well, the parazzi are still interested.
a 21-gun salute -- That's what his will said.
Mmm, nice to see a year after his death, Covington's ego lives on.
that is a good sandwich.
now that the death certificate's been issued, Sophie's giving Covington his elaborate send off.
maybe for the second time.
think she made sure that dive was his last?
well, she certainly had a lot to gain from his death.
that's Wilson Mailer, Covington's hedge-fund partner.
suspected he was dirty, too, but nothing stuck.
she didn't like that.
that's a familiar touch for a married man.
Oh, Covington's rocky marriage was all over the gossip rags when we were investigating them.
el leaves them in the bathroom.
well, perhaps that's why Sophie's so reclusive.
this is the first time i've had eyes on her outside of a boardroom.
he's keeping his distance. - Yeah.
he's too far away to be a curious bystander and too subtle to be parazzi.
Neal, you've hardly said a word.
are you sure you're up for this?
Ellen agreed to help me look into my father before she disappears into witsec again.
it's now or never.
there she is.
hello. - How are you?
good. - Good.
after all this time, I thought you two should know each other.
you must be Mozzie.
charmed.
is it safe for you out here?
Oh, as far as anyone's concerned, i'm, uh, long gone.
uh, wild guess -- Both of them are named marshal.
before I leave town, I think it's time you met my old friend Sam.
I contacted him after we talked last.
did he know my father?
he did.
he's a cop -- undercover for a long time.
a hard guy to get hold of.
what was going on in my department was bigger than your dad.
Sam was helping me get evidence on...the others.
others?
when your dad confessed, you, your mom, and I were thrown into witsec, and there was no time to look for answers.
work with Sam.
maybe you'll find what I wanted to, that he wasn't a bad guy.
I just want to know the truth.
you want to help me finish planting?
I would love to, but I got to get back to work.
I, on the other hand, am known for my work with yamadori bonsai.
that's true.
Oh, forget-me-nots -- a fitting au revoir.
look after her, okay? - I will.
I'll see you soon.
thank you again. - You're a dear.
let me get you some gloves.
Oh, sure.
our delicate hands are roughly the same size.
we're at the southeast corner by the monument.
Neal? - Yep.
he scorched a lot of earth when he left for his island adventure.
a little smoke damage here, but I wasn't totally unprepared.
you knew he was gonna run?
something i've learned -- things get stolen, and people go away.
most of the time, you don't get them back.
detail, attention!
forward arms!
wonder if he got a permit for that.
Yeah. - Make ready!
Aim! - Sophie's leaving before it's over.
fire!
not quite the grieving widow.
make ready! Aim! Fire!
make ready! Aim! Fire!
make ready! Aim! Fire!
fire! Fire!
I think you just saved my life.
you could be right.
you okay?
Sophie, over here! Wait up, Sophie!
I have to go. I have to go.
wait a second!
this way, Ma'am. Come on. Sophie, excuse me!
stay back!
Hey, you all right?
what happened?
somebody tried to grab Sophie.
looks like your insurance-fraud case just turned attempted kidnapping.
well, you can add theft to that list.
she stole my hat.
something didn't seem right, so we got out of the car.
I saw Neal start to run, got there as fast as I could, but the guy was gone.
it was a faded blue, grayish van -- no plates.
that's all I saw.
reporters captured a few photos of Caffrey's hat, but nothing we can use.
it all happened too fast.
Thanks, Peter.
Yep.
you'll be back, shouting down at us like alexander the great.
I see myself more as a Caesar.
you say Roman. I say Greek.
Burke, what are you doing here?
just gave Diana my statement.
the Covington widow.
kidnappings are usually personal.
okay, all right.
we should send somebody out there who knows every-- Caffrey, give us a minute, please.
Peter, justice is still reviewing your case.
Covington is an active investigation.
you need to back off.
I was lead on that investigation for a year. - I know.
I could consult outside my hours at the evidence warehouse.
no investigating, no field work.
tap me like a geyser.
I'll make a call as long as you keep it to that.
you said you were gonna make a call.
you want me to do it right now?
I'd appreciate that.
why were you leaving the memorial?
I was overwhelmed.
my driver had the car waiting around the corner.
who runs after nearly being kidnapped?
someone who feels like they're being chased.
figures you'd side with the fleeing suspect.
you know, the thing about fleeing suspects is, they can't say goodbye... To anyone.
well, that's on the lam 101.
you know why I had to run.
I do. And just so you know, the world did not stop spinning without you.
miss Covington, I know it's been a rough day, but we do want to help you.
do you?
when the FBI investigated my husband, my life was turned inside out.
after he died, that wretched insurance investigator all but accused me of murder.
think she's talking about you?
I've heard worse.
we're all just trying to do our jobs here.
you'll have to excuse me, but i've had my fill of law-enforcement types.
Hey, don't you need to get back to evidence?
convinced the brass to let me consult on all things Covington.
they made you a consultant?
do you have a radius?
I have a badge.
one last question
what is the nature of your relationship with Will Mailer?
you do not get to ask me about my personal life.
Ooh, touchy subject. Can I see that?
any more questions, you can contact my lawyer.
and call off your tail.
I'm sick of being followed.
we don't have surveillance on her.
neither does Sterling-Bosch.
that guy we saw lurking around the memorial
he's got to be involved.
Sophie's done with the FBI.
Oh, but I bet she would talk with the dashing stranger that saved her life.
Yeah, I could find out what's really going on between her and Mailer.
if someone is tailing her, we can get a look.
what are you thinking?
come with me. - Okay.
all right, you sure she won't recognize you from your investigation into her husband?
we never met in person.
all right, set me up.
I hope this wasn't too disruptive.
Oh, it's not a problem.
I'm just happy I could help out.
it's you.
you okay?
I was just giving my statement to agent Burke here.
Yes, thank you for your time, Mr...Armstrong.
uh, Neal. - well, at least now I know your name.
Yeah. Neal Armstrong. - like the astronaut.
one small step for man.
Sophie Covington.
nice to meet you.
I don't know how to thank you for what you did.
if there's ever anything that I can do, just please let me know.
actually, there is. Can I get my hat back?
I don't have it here.
we could meet for coffee or...
this is my address.
come by around 4: 00.
and i'll have it waiting for you.
all right.
if I can help you in any way, please give me a call.
he's one of the good guys.
are you -- one more thing to discuss with agent Burke.
see you at 4: 00. - bye.
well, uh, arms, arms
all those prosthetics in the evidence warehouse.
a-at least it's better than Neal Handleman.
no, it's not. I like Neal Handleman.
I should have gone with Eyes-Enhauer.
that would have been good.
this is Mr. Mailer.
just here to pick up my hat.
Ah, the knight in shining armor.
more of a right place, right time kind of thing.
Mr. Armstrong, it's good to see you.
call me Neal, please.
Neal, it's good to see you.
goodbye, Will.
hope I'm not interrupting. I didn't realize you'd have a friend over.
will's not a friend.
he was my husband's business partner.
so, tell me, Neal, are you a professional kidnapping interventionist or...
no, I'm an entrepreneur.
I've done well over the years, and I enjoy finding worthy causes to give back to.
I used to teach public school.
I -- after I met Grant, I started a charity for art programs.
the more I made, the more I gave away, which was just something else for us to fight about.
you have a beautiful home.
thank you.
I spend a lot of time here.
the media attention, it's just -- why you took my hat.
Yes, that's why I took your hat.
hmm, vintage.
Yeah. - I almost hate to give it back.
Oh, nice - thank you. - you're welcome.
speaking of vintage, um... Would you like a glass of wine or...
I'd love one.
okay.
I backpacked the costa Brava after college.
this Rioja reminds me of it.
to Spanish wine. - to hats.
so, how does this count as consulting?
confirming i. D. That's the same guy I saw at the memorial.
you know, I feel like I'm being followed.
Yeah, we're tailing your tail.
lose him so we can follow him home.
you're asking me to give up trade secrets?
call your patent lawyer.
just a minute.
one second.
gun! FBI! FBI!
don't hurt me!
calm down, or you're gonna hurt yourself!
okay, okay.
what were you doing at the Covington memorial today?
someone hire you to grab Sophie?
didn't get the job done, so you thought they were coming after you?
what? No. No, no, no.
so you usually answer the door like that?
I thought I was dealing with disgruntled husbands.
you don't strike me as the romantic type.
explain.
I'm a P. I. I work infidelity cases.
a lot of what I find tends to make people want to kill me.
who hired you to tail Sophie?
you pulled a weapon on a federal agent.
you are way past client confidentiality.
woman named Poppy Mailer.
mailer's wife.
she hired you to find out if he's having an affair with Sophie Covington.
is he?
uh, spent six months trying to confirm, but so far zip.
Mrs. Mailer's obsessed. She wants to know everything about Sophie.
who comes, who goes -- she wants it all.
you take any photos today?
t-they're in the printer.
I haven't gone through them yet.
old-school.
you got a shot of the kidnapper.
good thing we're collecting evidence today.
I need everything you have on Sophie Covington.
O-over there.
all that and no proof of an affair, and she still keeps you on retainer.
me and her psychic.
Sophie Covington -- what is she like?
from what I saw, she's not into murder, money, or Mailer.
so she's not the gold-digging, social-climbing husband murder that I read about?
no. I think she's lonely.
well, she's not a shopper, but Mailer is.
handbags, jewelry, flowers.
big spender for a guy who's low on money.
mailer's cellphone -- he calls Sophie, but she doesn't call back.
all right, these are Sophie's movements at the memorial.
Sophie gets there.
mailer's waiting.
he touches her.
she pulls away.
she leaves.
I don't see Mailer anywhere over here.
he's in the earlier shots but not the later ones.
because he's our kidnapper.
from Freddy's file, same red stripe on the glove.
all right, not definitive, but what if Mailer and Covington ran their insider-trading scheme together?
FBI's closing in, so Mailer pins it all on Covington.
sabotaged his diving equipment and kills him.
but he realizes Sophie's gonna get the insurance payout, so he seduces her.
she's not having it.
he decides to grab her at the memorial.
Why?
he could force her to transfer the money to an offshore account.
pay her own ransom.
it's basically a white-collar mugging.
Sophie wouldn't have gotten out of that van alive.
Mailer was at her place today.
if we're right, he's gonna try again.
Sophie likes you.
if Mailer thinks someone else is going to steal that fortune before he does
no, no, no. I'm not that guy.
I can't con a widow.
you can if it's to save her.
we force Mailer to act, and we nail him.
well, how do we convince him that we're an item?
Freddy. - good.
Freddy takes incriminating photos of you and Sophie.
Mrs. Mailer will not be able to resist using those to turn the screws on her husband.
come on. It's what we pay you the rainy-day bucks for.
come on, information.
I told you, he's unique.
so is Bob Saget.
that tells me nothing.
Mozzie invited me over to play cards.
that explains the marshals trying to blend in out front.
Ellen has so little time left in the city,
I thought she should spend it with friends.
that's awfully charitable of you for a weekday.
well, I do have ulterior motives.
I want to know more about you as a child.
I'm not talking.
come on, give me something.
he forged his school i. D. He, uh, conned the bullies out of their milk money.
wore ties to preschool.
no ties, but there was always a little con man in him.
I knew that.
talent like his is born.
it's not made. Come on, a "for instance.
okay, Neal loved school, but his mother wasn't, uh
punctual.
she was a mess. She never got me to school on time.
so, first, he broke in and adjusted the school clock so that class started 30 minutes later.
mind you, this was when he was in second grade.
okay, that could not have worked.
no, it didn't.
so then he tried barricading the roads and rerouting the school bus to run past his house.
that actually worked for a few days.
then he got smart and started forging his own city bus passes.
I was never late again.
Ooh, speaking of, I can't keep my shining knights waiting.
I should go.
great to see you.
I'll let you know when I hear from Sam, hmm?
okay.- bye-bye, Ellen.
Bye, Mozzie. Thanks for letting me win.
see you soon.
Thanks, Moz.
she's a nice lady.
Yeah. - she's really gonna miss New York.
we all do.
it's a hard city to leave.
now, you came in with a suit-induced frown.
can I help?
Yeah. Peter wants me to con a widow.
well, widows fall into two categories
the bereaved and the relieved.
which kind does he have you duping?
the kind with the $50-million bull's-eye on her back.
is she the killer?
no, she's not.
and I need to convince a P. I. That she and I are romantically involved.
well, that shouldn't be too hard, cheekbones.
don't ever call me that again.
I want you to tell the P. I. Who I am, who i've always been.
a con man? - exactly.
while you do what?
Mr. Armstrong. - Tony.
what are you doing here?
Oh, all that talk of Spain last night reminded me of cadaques
rocky beaches, artists' colonies, best seafood I ever had.
that is a paella pan.
how would you like to go to the costa Brava without leaving the house?
fellow ornithologist.
what kind of bird you watching?
the kind that steals nest eggs and flies south real fast.
man's got something on his mind besides the hat.
maltese falcon.
Yeah, yeah. - all true.
so, what were you doing in cadaques?
just passing through on my way from France.
found the Dali museum very challenging.
all right.
hope you're hungry.
best hal cart in the city.
want?
I'll take your word for it.
you know, your guy just started coming around.
Oh, probably smells the greenbacks.
you may have heard of him
con man.
Oh, world class.
this is really nice.
it's one of my favorites.
no, I mean this -- Staying in, making lunch.
never did that when I was married.
your husband wasn't into cooking?
turns out we actually didn't have that much in common.
I admit I jumped in without looking, but you make a choice and
and suddenly, you're living a life you never thought you'd have.
been there -- a couple times.
this the gala for your charity?
Yeah. I was gonna go, donate the insurance settlement.
all of it?
I don't feel right having it, but I'm not ready to go back out there, so i'll just send a check.
you know, not long ago, I took off for a while.
thought a break from New York was what I needed.
and then a friend helped me find a way to get my life back.
wasn't easy, but... It was worth it.
I should go.
okay. - can you walk me out?
sure.
guess this is goodbye?
guess it is.
okay.
Bye, Sophie. - bye.
forget something?
it looks better on you, but I should probably hang on to it.
Yeah.
all right. - all right.
must have been a hell of a paella.
Yeah, I went for the hug.
Sophie upped it to a kiss.
Yeah, and you couldn't deny the kiss 'cause you were working.
whatever it takes to get the job done.
good hustle. - Thank you. Where'd you get these?
envelope on my doorstep, along with an invoice for five hours of P. I.Work to be paid in cash.
honest day's work for Moz.
Yeah, for a change.
did you set up an auto alert on Mailer's bank account?
poppy withdraws anything more than 100 bucks, will Mailer gets a text message.
And?
worked like a charm.
we set up surveillance in Freddy's building.
she took out money.
he got curious and followed her.
this gets good.
poppy, what the hell is going on?
you followed me?!
you are going through money like water!
why don't you take a look at this, Will?
your whore has found herself another man.
you put a P. I. On Sophie?
how long has this been going on?
long enough to know what a bastard I married.
you know what the best part is?
hat man is after her money.
looks like Moz earned his pay.
Mm-hmm, when he gets me his social-security number.
Hello?
Sophie, hi.
I think we've found our widow of opportunity.
get it?
dropped the "n." - yeah.
mm, that...
Sophie invited Caffrey to escort her to the gala.
it's already hit the websites. Mailer will know.
if Mailer's plan is to grab Sophie, this is his chance.
we'll have agents at all points of entry
perimeter surrounding the building, outside her house.
if Mailer makes a move, we're ready.
we'll track you in the limo via cell signal.
all right, gear up.
head out.
Jones, take off Caffrey's anklet.
Where's Peter?
evidence.
nothing left to consult on.
he should be here.
don't worry, Caffrey --i'll be there to keep an eye on you.
ever tell you how much I hate that van?
everyone in position. Eyes on Mailer. Call it in.
that man is not happy.
well, the van will do that to you.
Caffrey better be on his best behavior.
Caffrey's en route.
sorry I kept you waiting.
don't worry about it.
you look beautiful.
Tony, how are we doing for time?
Oh, we should be all right, Miss Covington.
what's wrong? You seem distracted.
I'm admiring Tony's watch.
that the new fathom 20?
it is. - pricy.
was it worth it?
I think so.
you think I'd look good with a watch like Tony's?
I'm not sure it would suit you?
but you don't really know me, do you?
why do you think we met?
I don't know -- happy coincidence.
or rescuing you turned out to be the perfect way in.
in? What are you talking about?
when I was at your place, you told me you felt bad about having all that money.
I wanted to help.
so I took it off your hands.
you took it? - your banking information wasn't hard to find.
you stole $50 million from her?
Yeah, there it goes.
just put $50 million into my rainy-day account.
you were gonna give it away.
Tony, call the police.
Tony doesn't work for you anymore.
that watch means Tony can be bought.
he knows how to follow the money.
maybe he wants to come work for me.
she's got a party to get to.
let her out.
by the time you call that FBI agent Burke, we'll be long gone.
no one's making any calls.
I'm sorry, Miss Covington. Give me your phone and get out -- now.
what are you...?
you make me sick!
was any of it real?
go.
I need your phone, too.
that was a bad idea.
we'll see about that.
stop staring at me.
help me get through this, we can go home to the wives.
scale of worst evidence you've handled, how bad is this?
Oh, it's nothing.- the snakes -- that was bad.
I hate snakes.
agent Burke, this is Sophie Covington.
Sophie, you all right?
you said to call you if I needed help.
I need help.
the man that saved my life -- Neal?
he stole my money.
is that a personal call?
where is he now?
he's with Tony, my driver.
they -- they forced me out of my car, and he took my phone.
all right, Sophie, this is very important.
what exactly did Neal say to you?
he said he put my husband's life-insurance money into his rainy-day account.
he said that -- rainy-day account?
he said that by the time I called you, he'd be long gone.
he mentioned me by name?
that's how I rembered you'd given me your card.
he said he took $50 million, but I don't have that much money.
Sophie, you're gonna be okay.
stay where you are.
where are you going?
Burke, where are you going?
one step out that door, I write you up.
it goes on your record.
Burke, where are you going?
to cross the line.
saw a picture of you with Sophie Covington.
you move fast.
why not? She's a nice girl.
with a lot of money.
you screwed me. Twice.
but today, you forgot your lucky hat.
you don't need luck when you got a plan.
time to tell me who the hell you really are.
my name's Neal Caffrey.
I'm the best thing that ever happened to you.
Caffrey's signal's still not up.
pull traffic cams for all routes from the Covington residence.
right away, sir.
Hey, Peter!
what are you doing?
you weren't authorized to -- Neal is in trouble.
what the hell's going on?
are you tracking his phone?
well, the signal dropped. We're working on it.
this op's gone off the rails.
mailer's not coming.
he paid off Sophie's driver.
she and Caffrey both got grabbed?
Yeah, but Neal managed to get her out of the car.
Sophie called me.
she's safe, but he's on his own.
any idea where he is?
no, but I think I know how to get him out of there.
this way.
I thought it'd be best if you filled her in.
all yours.
Sophie... Neal works for the FBI.
we sent him undercover to protect you.
he said that he siphoned the life-insurance money from you, but he didn't.
then why would he say that?
to get you out of the car.
he figured out Tony had been paid off to abduct you.
paid off by who?
Wilson Mailer tried to kidnap you.
he's after the insurance payout.
Oh, my god.
I got here as fast as I could.
how do we get Caffrey out of there?
he passed me a message through Sophie.
we need to put the entire insurance settlement in Neal's bank account.
$25 million from each of you.
sure you got that message right?
Yeah.
I know Neal.
Sara, I'm sure you can get authorization for that.
you want 15%?
it's a good deal.
for you.
better deal for me is kill you and keep all of it.
I can't transfer the money if I'm dead.
you kill me, you've got a body to get rid of.
I've been seen with Sophie.
she thinks I stole the money.
I'm your face man.
you believe in luck, you can push yours, or you pay me enough money to disappear, and it's a win-win.
what keeps you from turning me in?
may i?
think a guy with a wanted poster is gonna go to the law?
so, your plan is to put $50 million into the personal bank account of a con man who recently fled to a remote island with no extradition?
so that he can transfer it to a financial genius who will have made every effort to make sure that we can't trace it.
Yep.
it's your money, ladies.
he saved my life.
I'm in.
he must have a plan.
10%, And you have a deal. - I can work with that.
do the transfer.
Sara, in or out?
okay. I'm in, too.
all right, Tony's paid off, I'm not saying anything, and you're a much richer man than I am.
it's a pleasure doing business with someone who sets the bar so high.
means something coming from you.
I got to ask -- Grant Covington -- how did you pull that off?
oxygen tank?
switched out the regulator valve.
just like that, nothing left behind.
if it weren't for that P. I.and his photos, I wouldn't have to run.
you've seen them, right?
there are none of you?
nothing left behind.
guess you really are a lucky man.
think I could get my phone back?
we should have heard from him by now.
Yeah.
well, the good news is, I'm alive.
that is good news.
wait, is there bad news?
depends on whether you're a "glass half full"or a "glass half empty" kind of person.
you lost half the money?
or a glass 10% full.
Mailer has 90%?!
sometimes in life, you have to cut a deal.
any other good news?
Yeah.
mailer's headed to Freddy's to destroy the evidence.
we don't have much time.
I send you, it's both our asses on the line.
Yeah.
Neal, I'm on my way.
FBI! Show me your hands. Drop the weapon.
nice gloves.
they look familiar.
it's kind of warm out there for those, isn't it?
Yeah, it's a beautiful day.
turn around.
Wilson Mailer, you're under arrest.
good thing we were behind that door.
guy who lives here would have shot you.
Sophie, the things I said in the limo -- you don't need to apologize.
listen, you asked me if any of it was real.
a lot of it was.
you saved my life.
and made you some paella.
and you saved my life again.
thank you... Neal Armstrong.
Neal armstrong -- definitely not real.
Yeah, kind of figured.
sure made for a great story, though.
we made the window for forensics to track the bank transfer.
money's been recovered, and it looks like they can prove Mailer tampered with Covington's regulator.
we can also get him on murder.
handed you an inch, you sprinted to the finish line.
Caffrey did the Same thing.
the two of you... Careful, Peter.
I don't want you to wake up one day and not recognize yourself.
they made a decision?
it is our recommendation that he be reinstated "as special agent in charge "of the Manhattan white-collar division effective immediately.
congratulations, honey.
Thanks. - congrats, Peter.
it'll be good to have you back in the office.
and we're not just saying that because we get to hand Caffrey back to you.
well, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for all of you.
you make me look good.
to Peter Burke.
the man we all wish we could be more like.
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!
let me get over here.
shake my boss's hand.
Yeah.
team's back together the way it should be.
refill?
Yes, lots to celebrate.
Peter's back.
Sophie's safe.
and you're mad at me.
come on.
truth.
Oh, Neal, I was.
you had a right.
after everything you did for me, I -- Neal, it's not about you.
that's very mature.
I told you about Emily.
your sister.
one day, I'm yelling at her for borrowing my clothes, - and the next -- she ran away.
you leaving like that -- It opened up some old wounds.
you know, she's out there somewhere. I just wish I knew where.
you deserve to know.
don't we all?
No!
I'm family! I'm family! I'm family!
they found me.
who? Who did this to you?
trust Sam.
all right, she's in respiratory arrest!
we got to go!
I want to come with you.
let us do our job, okay?
he was a dirty cop... and he's not dead.
you grew up in Witness Protection.
I was 3 when the marshals took us away.
Ellen agreed to help me look into my father before she disappears into WITSEC again.
we found a gun with your dad's prints on it.
he killed a cop?
he confessed.
Ellen! - They found me.
who? - Trust Sam.
I was undercover with the Flynn organization.
they were a local crime family with some P. D. on the payroll.
including my father?
Dennis Flynn Sr. died in prison.
this is his son.
maybe he's here for revenge.
Sam's blood. - Run his DNA.
Peter, he's here.
something you have to know, Neal.
why didn't you tell me?
tell you what? - That you're my father.
why didn't you tell me?
why did you lie to me?
I had a feeling that after everything you'd heard about me,
I'd be the last person you'd want to see walking through your door.
well, that's a big assumption to make.
did you kill a cop?
I'm a lot of things, Neal, but, uh... - not that.
no. Not that.
all right.
you tell me what did happen.
that was your third birthday. You remember?
no, I don't.
it was the hottest March in years.
Ellen and I had just gotten off duty.
dad! - Neal!
you didn't think I was gonna miss the cake, did you?
I had made detective three months earlier.
next thing you know, the two of you will be on patrol together.
I didn't wear the hat anymore, but you always loved it.
things were good then.
what changed?
I was young, driven, confident I could take on anybody.
all right, police! Hands in the air!
she said hands in the air! Drop it!
Ellen would have said I was arrogant. She probably would have been right.
well, that's great, but I want to know what happened to our family.
I'm telling you.
I was a good cop.
son of a bitch!
Ellen and I were on a tear.
all the bad guys were afraid of us.
you have to understand something, Neal.
I loved you and your mother very much, but we weren't rich.
it's not easy raising a family on a cop's salary.
we hit these gun runners, taking down their major suppliers.
let's go.
one operation, I find myself alone, staring at a crate full of cash.
one bundle was three months' salary.
what did you do?
I've thought a lot about that moment.
I could have gone either way.
flip a coin.
heads, I take it. Tails, I don't.
and you took it. - Yeah I took it.
Hey, Bennett.
that's when everything changed.
we got to talk.
your supervising officer sees you taking money from a crime scene, that should be the last thing you ever do as a cop.
but he said he'd look the other way if I did a couple favors for him.
and if not, you went to jail.
that's how I ended up working for the Flynns.
let's go, guys! Let's go! It's a raid!
they started me off small.
let's go!
making sure their guys got out the door before a bust, that sort of thing.
police! Hands in the air!
Ellen had no idea. - Police!
I was her partner, her best friend.
where the hell is everybody?
I was in her blind spot.
pretty soon, opening doors for the Irish mob wasn't enough.
I was also taking down a lot of the Flynns' competition.
that's when things got bad.
Neal, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
you're James Bennett.
I understand you have every reason not to trust me right now, Burke.
you told us you were Sam Phelps.
no, you assumed I was Sam Phelps. I didn't correct you.
did Ellen know that she was in contact with you and not Sam?
no. - So you lied to Ellen, too?
when I went into WITSEC, they sent me to Montana -- alone.
after about 10 years, I was going nuts.
I-I couldn't take it anymore.
they wouldn't tell me where you were, so I went back to D. C.
the only one who would talk to me was Sam.
he told me how he and Ellen had gotten very close to making a case against the people who framed me, but the only connection he had left with Ellen was a P. O. box
a way of getting in touch in case of an emergency.
and Sam gave you the P. O. box. - He was about to retire.
if Ellen reached out, he wanted somebody to be able to help her.
then one day... ...this showed up.
that's Ellen e-mail.
I was gonna tell her the truth when I got to New York, but I didn't get the chance.
listen, I've been here over a month, and I got nothing.
I don't even know who attacked me.
that's impossible. He died in prison.
this is Flynn Jr. the son who's trying to revive the family business.
we think he killed Ellen.
we plan to bring them down -- for good this time.
let me help you.
how bad are you injured?
Ah, it's just a bruised rib.
it's nothing I haven't slept off before.
I'll be in touch.
have fun in school.
okay. - Bye-bye.
you okay? - No. I'm not.
do you believe him?
right now, I want to focus on taking Flynn down.
this is Dennis Flynn Jr.
years ago, the Flynn crime family was dismantled.
he's spent the last 10 years trying to rebuild it.
according to organized crime, Flynn did so by moving into the white-collar world.
his latest venture is personal.
the Flynns started making money by bootlegging whiskey.
after prohibition ended, they moved into counterfeiting and used the Conroy family for distribution until they had a falling out.
I have Google, too.
Flynn doesn't normally get his hands dirty.
but because of the family history, he's handling this himself.
it's a decent fake.
the relief on the lettering is a little shallow, but if you've never held a bottle before, you wouldn't know that.
true test, however, is in the palate.
if you're pouring, I'll take a dram.
for Flynn, this venture symbolizes everything that once was great about the family.
it's not about profit. It's about pride.
even so, there's always money in good fake booze.
which this is not.
it's bottom shelf mixed with caramel coloring.
counterfeiting is all about creating the closest simulation to the real thing at a fraction of the cost.
Flynn needs better taste for a low price.
I can make a better product for him, gain his trust.
well, basic alcohol counterfeiting.
once you know the fundamentals, you can
good, we can get him on distribution of counterfeit items.
what are you talking about?
Thanks, guys.
we arrest Flynn for distribution?
that's it?
we don't have enough evidence for murder...yet.
but if we can prove distribution, he'll be locked up, and we'll be able to collect evidence.
you're the boss.
I want you to teach Jones everything you know about whiskey counterfeiting.
you can't bench me on this.
Yeah. I can. - It would take me a month to teach Jones everything I know, and you need me to make a good counterfeit.
are you ransoming your skills?
look, if it were easy to do, Flynn wouldn't have such a hard time finding a good one.
you're too close to this.
you really think you can keep a smile on your face when you're standing in front of that guy after what he's done?
Yeah, I do... Because I have to.
what are your thoughts on approaching him?
I must have lost my mind.
I went to New Jersey of my own free will.
if you want to get flavor extracts or find a discount tanning salon, there's no better place.
six different factories conveniently lined up for clandestine tasting.
just this one vial could make the entire Hudson River taste like...oh, bacon.
add that to your to-do list.
so, have you decided what brand we're gonna forge?
Shackleton whiskey.
Ah, the Shackleton
dug out of the Antarctic ice after Ernest Shackleton's ill-fated journey came to an abrupt end.
probably because he brought more whiskey than supplies.
they say you can taste the frozen tundra in every bottle.
what do you think that tastes like, Moz?
penguin feathers.
I have no idea.
my only bottle of Shackleton... - was lost in a bet to me.
Yeah, only because you cheated.
illegal usage of gum drop lane.
you lost a $200, 000 bottle of whiskey playing "Candy Land"?
high-stakes Candy Land.
darling, the next time, would you please read the rules more carefully?
thank you.
we have a deal?
Oh, we'll make you a couple bottles, I promise.
thank you so much.
Hey, are you going into the counterfeit-booze business?
no, no.
I'm getting a head start here on my Christmas shopping.
remind me to check the bottle of Barolo she got me last year.
Yeah.
look at that.
Mmm, quite the bouquet of fruit.
hmm, I taste, uh, apples and peaches.
plus toffee and caramel, with a hint of cinnamon.
no penguin feathers.
it's a complex mix.
this isn't gonna be easy.
all right, I finished charring the oak.
okay, that should add some body to this cheap whiskey.
Ooh, we got a lot of work to do.
we have a lot of work to drink.
if we're gonna match that flavor, we're gonna have to taste the wares
repeatedly.
in light of recent events, that will not be a problem.
you know, whiskey comes from a Gaelic word mean-- What?
you said "Gaelic."
a Gaelic word meaning "water of life."
now I understand that.
Yeah, and tomorrow morning, we are gonna find that name painfully ironic.
Mmm, a touch more Ceylon cinnamon. I think. - Oh, come on. It's perfect.
you just want me to keep drinking so that I'll talk about my father.
I admit nothing... unless it's working.
I don't know whether to be mad or impressed that my own dad conned me.
well, at least you learned where you inherited that particular skill from.
I keep thinking I should have known it was him.
that even after all these years, a man should know his own father when he's right in front of him.
and here he is, yet you seem hesitant to seize that opportunity.
to do what, Moz?
go out in the backyard and throw a baseball?
he doesn't get to come back here and make up for lost time.
this is ready.
okay. So, we just add the coloring to our faux Shackleton, and
we're not gonna add the coloring.
then it will obviously be a fake.
which is part of your plan.
did you tell me that already?
on the seventh tasting.
look, Flynn is looking for a counterfeiter, right?
so we have to prove to him that we can make something that's close to the real thing.
without making it appear that you just used the real thing.
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
Ah, so, once you convince him of your skill, then what's the plan?
Peter wants to take Flynn down for counterfeiting.
for counterfeiting, Moz.
Ellen deserves more than her killer getting a slap on the wrist.
so one way or another... I'm gonna make sure he goes down for murder.
Neal Caffrey hung over -- didn't think it was possible.
taste testing is a necessary part of counterfeiting whiskey.
Seriously?
you sacrificed for the greater good.
here's your reward.
what is that? - Pickle juice.
I'm not drinking that.
well, you should.
it's an old Burke family hangover cure.
Yeah. It was either that or raw eggs and butter.
now you're making stuff up.
is your batch ready?
it is. I tested it this morning.
Ah, hair of the dog -- also a good cure.
I don't know about the cure part.
how'd your end go?
this afternoon, Flynn will be at a micro-distillery tasting for event planners and liquor distributors.
how'd you find out -- organized crime tip?
organized wife tip.
she has access to the guest lists for these types of things.
she's not gonna be there, is she?
Yeah, she will.
she'll be fine.
Flynn is a very successful businessman.
he wouldn't do anything at this event to tarnish that reputation.
can she get me a booth?
already did.
so, drink your pickle juice.
I need you on your "A" game.
that's it.
and then when we're done, we'll, uh, need to finish our conversation with James.
would you mind handling that without me?
Neal, he's your father.
you have to talk to him.
he's a man we need information from.
and I know you'll ask all the right questions.
stop staring. You're hurting my head.
all right, I will.
Thanks. - Yeah.
you know, it's tough enough to read you even without the sunglasses.
hmm, maybe I'll keep them.
how you doing today?
thank you.
let me get set up here.
excellent.
excuse me.
Mr. Earnhart, glad you could make it.
thank you.
you know I never pass up an opportunity to get paid to drink good whiskey.
well, I think you're in luck.
we have a lot of amazing micro-distillers here today.
enjoy. - Thank you.
you ready for a tasting?
nice.
it looks like the pickle juice worked.
always does.
the hangover's gone, but what about when Neal sees Flynn?
jones is there to step in Neal's way if he needs help.
Plus, Elizabeth is armed with a very disapproving look.
I've got eyes on Flynn.
great.
once he's near Neal's booth, you guys are up.
all right.
let's see how well you know your whiskey, shall we?
in one of these, I have poured Shackleton whiskey, and in the other my own private micro-distillery.
let's see if you can tell the difference.
you think you can replicate Shackleton?
no, I did replicate it.
you familiar with Shackleton, sir?
I consult for Mackenzie Distillers.
Ah, who made the Shackleton replica a couple years ago.
it wasn't bad.
no, it was perfection.
no, this is.
but don't take my word for it. You tell me.
I'd like to try the other one.
be my guest.
Mmm, elegant, light, with a taste of Orkney Islands peat.
this is definitely the Shackleton.
no. No, this is the Shackleton.
it's the kind of whiskey a man would freeze to death for.
well, there's only one way to solve this.
let's find out who's right.
now, we all know Shackleton is renowned for its light amber color, so...
after you.
elegant and light.
gentlemen, I work at a micro-distillery.
you really think I can afford Shackleton?
I'm impressed.
we'll be in touch. - All right.
how did you distill it?
must have cost you a few bucks.
Oh, if I answer that question, you wouldn't need me, would you?
I get it. Thank you for the dram.
he didn't take the bait.
seems Caffrey was too legitimate.
I think I can fix this.
you shouldn't be here.
excuse me.
I'm sorry?
this is not a real distillery license number.
you forged the document.
listen, I-I think there's been a misunderstanding, okay?
I filed the paperwork already.
I should have it in a couple months.
well, until then, this is illegal.
please, don't call the cops, okay?
I won't.
but you should get out of here before someone else does.
all right.
got to say, I'm surprised a guy with your skills would need to fake a license.
Yeah, well... - Give me one of your business cards.
I'll be in touch.
I love it. My wife saved a sting.
I didn't save it.
I just gave it an extra push.
which saved it.
are you still meeting with Neal's father tonight? - I am.
I wish Neal would change his mind.
whatever my opinions of the man, James is his father.
Neal should hear everything from him.
can't imagine what Neal's been going through.
this is his chance to break the cycle.
if what James says is true.
about being framed?
do you believe him?
I'm willing to hear him out, and I think Neal should, too.
ask Neal again.
but this time, tell him we'll do it at our house over dinner.
a home-cooked meal with a con man and his long-lost, dirty-cop father?
Yeah, exactly.
maybe what this needs is a little normality.
good idea. I'll call him.
look, Peter, I told you -- I don't want to be there, all right?
Yeah, I'll think about it.
tell Elizabeth thank you.
I have discovered a new hobby.
drinking is the opposite of a new hobby for you.
hmm, I'm thinking about counterfeit tequila next time.
you should stock up on limes.
I'll get right on that.
so, what did the Suit want?
he invited me to dinner.
how dare he.
he also invited James.
what?
you should go.
et tu, Moz?
have you ever stopped to think about why he conned you?
Yeah, to find out what I knew about the evidence box.
or maybe to get to know you.
you don't know that.
would you have spoken to him if you'd known who he was?
I wasn't given the opportunity.
he conned his son into bonding with him.
it's hardly a Hallmark moment.
I didn't say it was noble, but it was human and dare I say...
something you might have done.
look, every orphan wants to know their parents.
I know I'd give anything to know mine.
you can, Neal, right now.
don't throw away that chance.
well, I,uh -- I appreciate the thought, Peter, but I don't think he's coming.
well, he's always late.
no, he's not.
that much I've learned about him, so it'll have to do for now.
you know, I-I'm very grateful for you guys being a family to him.
it's nice to know he's got people like you two in his life.
mm, I'll get that.
is this real or fake?
Oh, that's real.
I've had my fill of counterfeit things lately.
I'm glad you're here. - Thanks.
hon, what's so funny?
it's nothing. It's just, um, the two of you are sneaking pot roast to the dog in the same way.
you're putting it into your napkin and then palming it to the dog -- it's very funny.
I'm sorry. - Sorry, Liz.
Satchmo looked hungry, so I just...
no, um, Peter cooked the pot roast.
I mean, it's a little -- it's a little dry.
uh, yeah, it is.
I was hoping Satchmo would take some of mine, as well.
perfect segue into dessert, yes?
Yes, yes. Yeah.
uh, I'm actually gonna go walk Satchmo, as well.
all right.
thank you very much.
get that out of your way.
Thanks.
Satch, come on.
I hear you're going undercover with the Flynns.
I am.
you have no idea how dangerous those guys are.
I've dealt with worse people.
I don't think you have.
then maybe now is a good time for you to finish your story.
when did you first encounter the Flynns?
when I tried to get out.
I couldn't take it anymore.
I got tired of lying to your mother and to Ellen.
I was dreading the day that you'd find out that your father was a crook.
I'm out.
you don't get to make the terms of this, James.
I don't care. It's too much.
I'll tell you what.
but Flynn Sr. knew I was valuable.
he threatened me, showed me a gun he'd used to kill a cop.
he kept the murder weapon on him?
in an old whiskey box.
it was his way of showing that he was untouchable.
but I was adamant, and, uh, eventually, he relented and said that he'd let me out if I did one last job.
what was it?
he told me that my supervising officer would have it.
but when I got there, I thought they were gonna kill me.
everyone not in the family is disposable to them, after all, including my supervising officer.
they'd killed him with my spare firearm.
they'd stolen it out of my locker.
see, they timed their frame perfectly.
drop the gun.
even Ellen didn't believe me at first.
but you convinced her.
the truth convinced her, and I'm hoping that once I have this box with the evidence she found, it will convince you, too.
can you show me one piece of that evidence now?
Ellen believed me.
well, she's dead, so I'm gonna need a little more than that.
Neal. - No, he already conned me once.
and I know better than anyone, the stories are meaningless unless you got something to back it up.
excuse me.
Yeah. All right.
I'll be there tomorrow.
thanks for dinner, Peter. I got to go.
what? Where?
to prepare. Dennis Flynn's got a job for me.
looks like I'm back in the family business.
have you heard of the Flynn family?
can't say that I have.
see, that's a problem.
back in the old days, everybody knew our name and what it meant.
what did it mean?
whiskey. It was prohibition.
we were the biggest game in town.
what happened after prohibition ended?
Ah, we moved on to other things, built an empire.
and then the feds tore everything down.
trumped-up charges, of course.
of course.
I've been rebuilding it ever since.
my old man would have been proud.
what did your father do?
he was a cop.
you didn't follow in his footsteps.
no. I thought about it, but...wasn't for me.
well, fathers can be a tough thing to live up to.
probably best that you went your own way.
you're telling me.
is that an F-520 column still?
Yes, sir.
can't wait to play with that.
you know, actually, I'm a little more interested in your, uh
your knack for imitations.
how soon can you start?
Oh, I can get the bottles of Shackleton going right away.
how are you gonna sell them?
don't be too eager, Neal.
once he indicates he intends to sell the whiskey, we can move.
no, I-I'm not gonna sell them.
that would be illegal.
this is just, uh -- it's just a hobby.
it's a really expensive hobby you got there.
Yeah, well, the best ones are.
Oh, and, uh, you won't be making Shackleton.
you'll be making the booze my family used to sell.
that's $100, 000 bottle of whiskey.
they only make 55 a year.
and I'll need 55 more.
can you do it?
are you listening to me? Can you do it?
Yeah. Yeah, sorry, I got distracted by the...Higgins-Barrow.
I've never seen one in person before.
Yeah, there it is.
Yeah, I can do the job.
that's great. We'll, uh, start in a few weeks.
a few weeks?
why wait?
well, duplicating a McCann isn't just about what's inside.
each of the bottles has to be hand-blown.
for your hobby?
Yeah, that's right.
there's no reason to have one if you're not gonna do it right.
I'll call you when I find someone.
I can do it.
Neal, don't push it.
can he make the bottles?
I have no idea.
you're telling me that not only can you perfectly imitate the booze but you can blow the bottles, too?
well, I need some help from a friend.
the air quality in here is abysmal.
do you know the effect that can have on the cooling glass?
and you call that a furnace?
it's the best money can buy.
Yeah, exactly.
furnaces should have character, like the pieces that are born from them.
are you saying you can't do the job?
of course I can do the job.
these will do fine.
I'll also need newspaper. I prefer The New York Times.
planning your restroom breaks already?
you dampen the paper and char it, then use it to shape the piece.
newspaper?
he's the best.
Yeah, he better be.
you do realize I haven't blown glass since before they faked Reagan's death.
I'm a little out of practice.
you'll be fine, Moz.
Oh, I'm gonna miss my eyebrows.
along with my bangs.
Oh, great. Now he's also big brother.
well, we're an investment.
let's show him he made the right choice.
and once he leaves his office, I'm going in there.
why would he need to get into his office?
I don't know, but whatever the reason is, I know I'm not gonna like it.
good job, Moz.
not so out of practice after all.
Yep, like riding a horse.
you're allergic to horses.
whatever.
you got this for a second?
okay. I'll, uh, just stand here, holding molten glass.
Yeah, just give me one sec.
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing?!
what the hell is he doing?
uh, I told you, I'd never seen a Higgins-Barrow in person.
and I've definitely never tasted it.
you think you can just come in here and drink my booze?
all agents, be ready to move in.
Neal may not make it out of this one.
I was gonna share.
you're crazy. You know that?
and you really love your whiskey.
well, that's the reason that I'm so good at making it.
celebrating a little early, don't you think?
no, the glass is coming along well.
we'll have the first of 55 ready in an hour.
once we've perfected the mold -- Uh, I actually don't give a crap.
how long will the rest take?
a day. Maybe two.
one day it is.
Well...- Well...chop-chop.
thanks for the taste.
you broke into his office.
the door was unlocked.
don't play semantics.
James was telling the truth.
What'd you find?
Flynn has a gun in his whiskey case.
it's a Browning P9R, the same model used to kill Ellen.
Flynn Sr. was arrogant enough to hold onto a murder weapon.
you really think his son would do the same?
he wants to be just like his father.
he's obsessed with the family's history, getting things back to how they were.
the same model doesn't mean the same gun.
it means my father was telling the truth.
don't go off book again.
if we stay the course and arrest him on distribution, our warrant will allow us to seize everything in the warehouse.
including the gun?
Yes. - Okay, but how?
Flynn's playing it safe with me.
but he'll talk to the Conroys.
