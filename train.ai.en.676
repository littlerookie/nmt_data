showa shell's push into solar comes as a way to adjust to declining oil demand in japan, a trend expected to continue, given the nation's slumping economy, aging population, the adoption of hybrid cars and the move toward cleaner-burning natural gas for power generation.
showa shell, which accounts for roughly 12% of japan's oil-refining capacity, plans to cut its capacity roughly 20% next year.
