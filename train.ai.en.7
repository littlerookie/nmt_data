that's all this is -
you're a man haunted by those two most terrible words:
you're just imagining things.
this is all just a game, isn't it?
the only question is for how long?
everything is just muck
everything is dust in the wind.
everything was great,
things were going good, weren't they? That's exactly why I had to blow it up.
everything's a fucking lie anyway.
that's what it's all about, isn't it?
it was great, fine.
dump, or look'd upon this love, with idle sight, what might you think?
the things that didn't go the way you wanted.
like every other non-magical romance,
it poisons everything it touches,
all treaties with the Indian nation

how much everything reminds me of him.
everything is made of gold.

everything would be different now.
and it will happen again.
and everything would return to normal.
everything, including him.
there will be no stopping them,
it would all be over.
and everything's gonna be back to normal.
everything supposed to be settled, and normal.
it's to be expecd.
everything may be done but in turns.

and it's business as usual.
OutcalIs only. This is classy stuff.
until the inquiry can establish the full facts of the matter.
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
the picture painted broad and clear.
there is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things, captain Gower
and that things will be resolved fairly for everyone concerned.
everything like the Pope almost.
things were back to normal.
the whole thing about getting on that plane
and everything's kind of perfect for you
how everything's going to... Be.
and everything would just happen.
everything will be explained.
before you betrayed me.
anything. Everything.
everything will be all right.
everything is everything, I ain't seen nothing.
everything's always been about you, never about me

anything, and I want you to remember that no matter what,
and every person in that room.
well, everything.
our mother, the earth, shook,
nothing ever changes
the center of all things is the human being!
that everything is governed by logic
nothing exists in and of itself;
everything feels not quite normal,
everything seems to be in order.
everything is what it is,
as if everything is much more than itself.
everything's on a different scale.
everything is just all about you.
days are starting to pull everything together.
there's always been an explanation.
nothing's random.
and everything is so bright it hurts your eyes.
everything is.
all things connect.
and things'll get better.
everything over your marriage.
everything in its place.
everything's shipshape, but I keep hearing footsteps.
everything is very orderly, very arranged, very clean. Wonderful.
everything's straight.
everything worked out alright, cos we had rules.
it's up to the fates to decide.
then comes God.
it's your show.
she's all yours.
let the God decide everything
everything goes to bones.
command me in all things.
don't try anything. Just let us handle it.
I do all the work.
you gotta let me handle this
it really is a mystery
figuring everything out, choosing the right small business accounting program.
to all of what? The sins of your father.
none of what? I don't understand.
everything. - what? - I will tell him everything.
all of what? All this.
from the perfect start to the finish line
that's just guesswork.
and all foes the cup of their deservings. See, see!
everything. Everything happened to me today.
this morning has been so unexpected.
it was everything.
that's what counts.
it's still difficult.
it seems like only yesterday.
very surreal still that we're here.
and moved on.
again, all is well.
1791 was the year it happened.
it all started on new year's Eve, 1962.
it starts with a fairy bestowing a spell.
it all started with a phone call.
it started out as a robbery.
when did everything change?
it all began very early this morning as a bank robbery.
it all started with him.
everything has started when he said this.
it started as an office thing, you know, light, fun.
that had commenced with Ernie announcing my death to nurse noakes.
it's how you clean it up that counts.
everything up untiI the killing will be a gas.
everything up until the killing... Will be a gas
everything. What is it?
it all started 30 - odd years ago.
it was a lie from the beginning.
it all started when I realized I'm probably dying.
it begins just after sunrise.
none of it happened.
couldn't be better.
it all starts from here.
it started in Bern, Switzerland. 1999.
it starts with a quiet hum, a empty scree inviting you.
but it started with truth.
for everything... For meeting you in the first place,
I thought we'd keep things simple.
we've never actually manage to keep anything simple.
everything begins with listening
everything is based on the fat.
all starts here
and it all went downhill from there.
starts there.
start with the money.
where to take things from here.
everything has started there, with taking off.
by starting this post-mortem examination first.
everything, he knew all the things
everything - everything they've done so far
every trace of them.
everything they can find out from other sources.
any assistance he can provide, Colonel.

everything. What kind of kid was he?
he's in charge.
everything he looked at.
anything he can get his hands on.
and everything was okay.
Qinning knows no pain.

the exciting things she wants to feel with her fingertips.
everything scares me.
and my first priority is protecting her.
military needs are a priority.
and we won't act rashly

that baby is the priority.
your life is the priority, whether you like it or not.

whatever it takes. Everything in my power.
just for you.
it'll be like this never happened.
that's so yesterday.
it all feels like yesterday
and it seems like all is dying, and would leave the world to mourn
everything, it seemed, was waiting.
I was true itself. - who are you?
then it all made sense?
it's like I see things now -
every successful business has an origin story.
that those who would harm you will die screaming.
and every fair from fair sometime declines,
it'll be just like we planned.
all things will rise.
looking good for a change.
and everything's gonna be better, I promise you.
and it'll be clear.
only makes it that much more perfect.
things are going to get better
I know everything. It went on.

will that change anything?
everything will be explained to you en route.
it's all right.
it's all right. It's all right
but wouldn't it be something

I think it's gonna be okay, ladies. She's turned the page.
it's gonna be okay. Okay.
everything's gonna be all right. I promise.
this will get easier soon. I promise.
everything's gonna be fine. I saw it.
it'll be good. Yeah?
does it get better?
it's gonna be fine. All we need is $400.
and things could be just as before
things'll go your way
everything's going to be okay.
things will work out.
this would work a lot faster, if I had an account number.
everything's going to quiet down.
all may yet be well.
things are gonna be... Beautiful?
it'll all work out.
and we're good to go, so long as we don't hit any snags.
things will go back to exactly as they were?
and then things will start getting back to normal.
should look like business as usual.
things are gonna change, I heard... Gonna

everything will be all right. Sister, I can handle this.
everything will be fine, okay?
everything will be fine, I - I promise.
it's going to be fine. Just be yourself.
it's - it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be fine, all right?
that everything could suddenly fall apart.
shouldn't you be present for all the meetings?
it's all gonna work out. Where are you going?
it's all gonna work out. Where are you going?
was gonna matter this much? No.
are we even gonna be able to run everything?
it's gonna be okay.
you're going to be fine. There's nothing to worry about.
all great must come from loss,
all greatness comes from loss.
all the world's great civilizations have followed the same path.
everything just, sort of, falIs away.
everything seems perfect.
everything seems fine.
all is not what it seems.
seemed easiest that way.
it just seemed so easy, you know?
Yeah, it's kind of all been one long horror story.
it seems that everything is moving.
things seem to be getting better.
Everyhting was great. Then I met this girl and.
everything seemed perfectly normal
where everything looks distorted.
Balin: everything appears to be in order.
everything seems out of place.
everything seemed fine.
things seem to be running fine right now.
everything seems to be doing well. Yes?
everything is flaring
deja vu all over again.
dejavu. This is so -
everything. And you let her down.
everything. But I wanted to hear it from you.
anything I can buy low and sell high.
the art of the sport was reduced to something less than that.
to the outcome of sporting events.
nothing that will disrupt trade or politics.
everything he did to you while you were protecting me.
anything else you can find.
everything you've done. Everything.
everything you can imagine.
everything you could need to put anything on paper, to film anything,
everything about your relationship with Virginia hill, have you?
as soon as you're done, come up.
everything? What are you doing
everything. You have it so easy.
everything. What do you want from Francis?
everything you want, everything you need.
all of that, you know, how much.
everything, everything you've built.
you buy them everything you want.
everything you feel.
everything you've ever known, felt, believed.
anything you have hidden, she'll find it.
everything you have, somebody gave to you.
everything you've ever dreamed of doing with a woman.
is everything... Moving okay in there?
everything you see, all of it, really, is her.
you saw in there.
eh.. Everything. You wanna know what turns me on?
about him and his underlings to a federal agent.
just things that you can draw extra power from.
well, anything you can tell us can be helpful.
anything you can imagine.
whatever you can find.
anything you can, all righ
looking for what you can get your hands on
for everything? Cann't you be more precise?
everything you can.
it's all in there - everything you have to say.
everything you think you feel,
everything you think you know.
just do whatever you want.
changed everything? What are you talking about?
you're in charge. I know, I'm sorry. Just keep me in the loop.
everything meet with your approval?
everything? You're far too eager and curious for a Hobbit.
you did everything right.
you won't remember any of this.
you remember everything so clearly.
anything you cann't do without.
all that most Maddens and torments... - Kitai, wake up!
all missions have their complications.
everything has caused us to become more optimistic.
anything you want, sugar.
whatever you say, father.
always do what the doctor orders.
everything is the same.
do as planned
we'll follow the international rules.
and, well, the whole thing crumbles.
but them everything comes out
and everything will be grand. It's time you grew up.
everything stays the same.
we kept some things there.
keeps everything neat.
we'll keep everything nice and low - profile.
everything will fall apart. I'm sorry, that's not my problem.
all the info about it is on our website.
Yeah, and all we knew was what he told us.
you have on Chad mills.
all repairs are temporary and short term.
anything worth stealing
everything worth discovering has been discovered.
stop everything!
stop everything. Sam!
all due festiveness, celebrations, various and sundry merriments,
it runs on its own.
it's simply not going to happen.
I'll need full access to the fraternity.
all good reasons why there are more peregrines here
~ all is alive ~
all is alive
furthest removedfrom all light and warmth.
you know, all that matters is what happens on that stage, right?
you're shit out of luck, mommy.
it all started with this fake hair and your stupid water bras.
if not, then thank God you were lucky.
we'll leave that to darken Rahl.
it all comes down to the vehicle you use to do it.
it all changed.
'cause you're well - designed bow tie!
above all because I was young.
everything is in your control.
it was all over the media.
I got the situation completely under control.
all of it was my memory.
we have a plan.
all is lost.
it all pointed to a cop. Or an ex-cop.
it's all gone pear shaped.
for revenge.
she's the one calling all the shots now.
it's just shit!
it's up to you.
it's up to you.
and it's very nice that it all started here.
we're counting on you!
we're counting on you, Leonard.
it's all about heart.
all is forgiven.
it's location, location, location.
everything about you.
about protecting this island
all that nonsense about mining claims and starting your own businesses.
everything I learned about being a good cop, I learned from you.
to suppress any bad publicity about lifetrace.
any forensic examination of the black stone is strictly forbidden.
that the power in all relationships lies with whoever cares less.
of everything else you're working on.
everything that has a wireless capability
about the company... What.
the true author of a tell - all tome has been revealed,
things are never gonna be the way they were?
it is happening again. Amy, this was forty years ago.
everything's gonna be normal again.
perked up and spanking clean again,
everything was easy.
the more chance there is of the same thing happening all over again:
nature's full of powerful concoctions.
everything happens to me. And now I'm shot by a child!
here, everything is in the parents' hand.
you can always find problems with any decision,
well, everything's prepared.
we're all set. Us too.
most of my work has been geared toward creating the illusion.
all set!
everything's fine. Just we're all set.
everything set?
everything ready? Yeah.
when all is arranged, I will get word to you.
everything ready? For the last two hours.
it's been two months since everything was ready for their work,
I soaped the floor of his cage.
everything is in place.
ready to go, sir!
so, everything is settled
preparations are in order?
all hands on deck.
all set? - yes, sir.
man your guns back there.
all gonna light the light
all in order.
all systems go!
we're ready for the start,
the stage is set and the final battle between heaven and hell is about to begin!
when we're ready, I'm gonna count backwards from three, and then you jump.
everything is in order then?
everything is ready now.
is everything in place?
all is in place. They will consent to the wedding.
all prepares are ready ready to launch
all the preparations for your invasion are in order.
everything is in position for ready or listen

I've got everything. I'll fly you up there. I've got a plane.
everything's set. Everyone's in place.
I have everything I need. Get the car.
se gira and we are rolling.
once everything's deployed, we're ready to start looking around,
all is ready. There's a wounded Turk who wants to speak to you.
all set. - must we?
with everything in place, Charlie and Fred
everything's ready. All we need now is you.
when we're ready.
we're ready for you on stage, Mr. Lefort!
all is in order, sir.
we're ready, sir.
it's like it's all brand new.
it's almost under control. Joe.
affairs don't happen in a vacuum.
everything else was just filler.
it is the beginning.
this is just the beginning
just when things were getting better.
it all just got away from me, and I ended up hurting that
as a start.
the source of all creation and destruction.
there's nowhere we can go
we're in position。
all clear。 Subject identified and unarmed。 Roger that。
with how it happened and who did it。
and it'll be clear。
everything was gonna work out in the end。
everything is going to be perfect。
and he believes in it long enough and hard enough that it all appears before him， see?
but that all stops now。
not anymore。
everything ends now。 You end now。
so this is how it ends?
it's over。 I take my hug back。
this ends now。
under the assumption that he can help us find the nuclear warhead。
until we get the deal we want。
while you're at it, call the community to a meeting
and when everything's done, I'm gonna come back and get you。
you could tell you were completely in charge of everything that you did。
everything, you hear me?
it makes all the trying worthwhile。
and again, the immediate push has to be on this appeal。
despite our best efforts, an attack is imminent。
would all their work crumble to the ground,
it's imperative。
and I'll take care of everything。
no further communication will be accepted。
nothing's done。
insects work in harmony, timing their calIs to fall between the notes of others。
everything should feel natural。
it's all about to happen。
are just about to come home to find purchase.
everything will unravel。
everything's falling apart。
won't stand for any more of it. Put a man into the dock, call him a Molly.
always so real
everything falIs apart。
but where everything still remains according to the wishes of the king!
it feels like it happened yesterday.
something happened. Something.
it was all set. First, we'd go to college together,
none of this was supposed to happen this way.
it was all right there.
there is no excuse shall serve.
that changes everything. What?
all cold and slimy. Everything faded away like I was drowning.
everything happened again! Exactly the same!
well, everything is back to being as bad as usual.
everything went back to how it was before. At least, that's how it looked.
as the dry season ends.
everything would go back to normal.
everything just goes back to how it was.
the coroner's report backs his story.
things are gonna go back to the way they used to be!
and the story ended where it began.
it brought it all back.
it all comes down to tradition and conformity.
go back to the way it was.
all of which brings us back to the motive of robbery.
it's back to square one.
life was only just returning to the tracks.
and things got back to normal.
things were back on track.
everything's back to normal.
everything was back to going off without a hitch.
it was like the 1945 may days "again"
it's all good again.
here we go again.
it's happening again.
everything goes weird again.
and forever start again
it all went back to normal.
it was quiet again.
all's right in the world again.
things went back to normal.
and things get back to normal.
and thi ngs went back to normal
things get back on track and before you know it
I guess things go back to normal, huh?
order is restored.
everything's perfect again.
it's all going to happen again.
it all falIs apart again.
everything went back to how it was before, at Ieast, that's how it looked,
and everything gets back on track.
everything's perfect again. I thought you lied to me.
all the way home I'll be warm
so it's come back to my old passion again:
everything's perfect again. - I thought you lied to me.
and things went back to normal
and it brings me right back to reality
it's happening again, and I should be out there
that any resistance has been overcome.
Yeah, things work out.
things were going too well?
it was going well, till one day.
it all happened so fast.
it happened. It just happened.
all takes place in a space station.
it all started a long time ago.
it all started in the second round foreman comes out swinging
I mean, it's all just flashes, you know.
this is happening so fast.
it happened so fast.
all happened so fast.
everything happened so fast,
I - I mean it all happened so fast
it happened so fast. You know, you been working for me.
it all happened so quickly. She tried... I tried.
everything happened so fast. I'm sorry.
everything happened so fast. I Didn't know who else to call.
it happened so fast, there was nothing I could do.
it happened so quick, I Didn't believe him.
it all happened so fast, I don't think I'd be much help.
it happened so fast. It was snowing. The bombs.
all happened so fast. Probably just a crime of opportunity.
it was so fast and so loud.
it just happened so suddenly, you know?
it was completelYout of the blue.
it all happened so sudden.
well, the whole thing comes crashing down, and he slides on it for like 50 feet.
it happened so quickly, she Didn't suffer.
everything happened really fast.
it happened so fast I did it without thinking.
it was all so stupid.
all this happened rather quickly.
it all just happened so fast.
it happened s - so quickly.
and I wanna see her eyes as I do it.
as if the living I've done so far hasn't actually been real life
events that have happened are happening now.
that happened because two men woke up this morning
it happened really fast.
and it happened real quick.
everything so quick!
everything's moving kinda fast. Maybe we should slow it down.
it all happened so fast, but.
it all happened really fast. I don't even remember if it was painful.
everything happened so fast. I went to go help him.
it all happened so fast, you know?
it all happened so fast.
everything happened so fast. Just like what I saw
I was in orbit when it happened
things are moving faster than I thought they would.
everything happened fast
the day everything changed.
how the hell am I supposed to launch the drug?
it's all up to him.
everything depends on you.
it's up to the ladies.
that's up to her, isn't it?
all depends on whether or not we're able to learn from our mistakes.
everything's back to being up to us again.
it's, you know, it's how the picture makes you feel.
you gotta make 'em happen it all depends on you
everything depends upon speed.
everything was moving so fast.
it goes by so quickly.
nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley.
everything becomes unstable.
everything has become more complicated.
it's just, everything's changing so fast.
it just became so terrible.
it only gets better
things got worse.
everything is interesting.
and there's just nothing now.
everything became clearer.
it's becoming as plain as day. It has been to me for some time.
it all became very real.
everything we've become is bullshit!
cann't be any better
it was such an empty,
it's just gotten so bad.
the whole thing just fell apart.
it all becomes numbing.
and it's all your fauIt this is all so fucked up.
it'll be a relief.
give the contract back before things get out of hand.
any password.
it was all over in 10 seconds.
everything is nothing more than
but only you.
all to curry the favor of a lousy king.
you've somehow made this all about you.
which you know can only end in disaster.
things get worse, not better.
there's nowhere to go but up.
and it's only getting worse.
all 'cause you won't listen
all this for Constance?
and it can mean whatever we want.
it's all because you broke a promise!
all of this is just
and it's all just a fairy tale.
about the whole misunderstanding.
that's what this gets down to is a baseball card?
it was all just a fantasy.
it's about her and her mind games.
it was only the beginning.
it's all about fast cars and cussing each other
it was all a bad dream.
and all because a young girl
because I cann't give you a chiId. Well, you know what?
that she imagined it?
it's just a big series of coincidences, OK?
and this is just the beginning.
anything more would be mere speculation.
all gussied up, but dead inside.
just all innuendo.
all we have to do is wait.
it's just a matter of time now.
well, that all tracks.
they were just moving on.
ain't nothing over till it's over.
it has to be done manually.
dependent on your sighting system.
and all it would have taken was for her to simply say,
that they could be.
it can happen so quickly.
it should be simpler than this, shouldn't it?
that could have exonerated my father was on that plane.
nothing has changed. Everything has changed.
anything that'd burn and keep us warm.
there's nothing here that cann't wait till tomorrow.
anything metal where items can be hidden.
whatever creates the fewest ripples.
it could be just like it was. No!
all well?
is everything OK?
everything okay? No. I gotta go to work.
everything OK? Why don't you ask your roommate?
how do you do, fellow kids?
everything all right?
how's it going? Good. Great, actually.
everything all right, miss. What do you want?
everything okay? - Oh, yeah.
everything okay?
is everything all right?.. To give him a deadly virus.
everything okay? Everything's all right, boss.
so, tell me, how's everything going, darling? Did Marcel come and fetch you?
acts of black night, abominable deeds,
everything changes.
any suspicious personsor activities.
anything out of place.
everything's so fucking green.
anything that could've been, has happened somewhere.
everything that can make the urine brown,
it would be different.
from the environment.
to all the possibilities.
that things maybe really are black and white!
it may be a cultural misunderstanding.
everything that could fucking go wrong
all of which are constantly diverging.
anything that is corruptible is susceptible to their influence.
I Didn't get all this by being stupid.
anything with a taste for human.
nice to have things legal and tidy, don't you agree?
everything fits. It's a good ending.
everything is coming at me at once and I just want it all to go away.
the decisions and its consequences rest with me.
but they were mine and they were mine alone.
don't worry about the mess.
I understand
look, I'm the one who created this mess.
play for that motherfucking money.
it's about money.
just follow the money.
going where the money is or taking down old ladies.
follow the money. Copy that.
what, go where the money is? Tried that. Failed.
anything? Anything.
everything? Yes, everything.
we got other leads we can follow.
for I resign to thee.
whatever you say.
it's under my command. OK?
whatever you want to do.
I'll do whatever you want.
anything you say, honey.
okay, dad. Whatever.
I am yours to command.
I will, if you want me to.
I will respect that.
I will do whatever you ask.
it's in the hands of the goddess now.
Yeah, all those hostages to fortune.
to do as commanded.
that's just the reality of it,
I'm your girl.
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.
whatever I fucking desire.
nobody moves until I signal.
I'm the boss of you, OK? So calm down.
listen to your T.O., you're golden. See, now that's a horoscope I can actually get behind.
everything sounds wonderful.
everything. Look, if you could just trust me,
doesn't that sound simply gorgeous?
which sounds incredibly noble until you kill someone.
is, uh... Is everything okay?
anything goes.
and all will be as it was before.
it'll be just like it used to be.
you know, everything with you has to be so jokay.
it doesn't have anything to do with you anymore. Okay?
any sort of... Contact with you.
and everything about these murders says gangs.
all the songs we know about babies.
all that stuff that was by the pallet had been moved over there.
and all that is peace.
peace on earth, goodwill to
anything Italian, except anchovies.
anything that dies.
for a connection to the Romanians.
anything would be ours for the taking.
everything. GirIs all fit a profile.
I'll take care of everything
everything? What does that mean?
flows all that is good,
after all the commotion, I peeped my peeper out the peephole,
everything. Hey, don't get me wrong here.
so it's back to you - your... Travalls yield anything on our mystery impressions?
everything is back to normal.
starting over.
they're back to where they started.
everything's come full circle.
we're back in business!
back on track. Feel free.
everything back to normal.

peace.
and... It's finally peaceful. No monsters, no disease, no death.
everything. Back to normal.
aren't you glad things are back to normal?
everything is better when she's there.
it all began with Ernest, with his obsession.
it started as a lump under your arm.
you caused it.
starts with the family jewels
I started this, and now I need to finish it.
well, guiIt could be a powerful motivator.
it changed everything.
hoarding started with the mom.
begun by blood,
things are so much smoother when we lie
for just about everything,
like no problems pressing down on my shoulders.
it's all about you.
it's all about you, isn't it?
all of you creatures.
nations and men of every language worshipped him.
this'll all be over in the next hour. Frank, um -
there are all about the teams
it's all about accepting who you really are.
it's all about strategy, outmaneuvering the opposition, bending him your will.
everything's going to change today.
and the truth is, nothing I ever do is good enough.
to be better than all of those that fell before him.
everything is part of a big.
it all happened in seconds.
everything is organized in an anonymous chat room
worked so well we let you do it again.
all... Comfort... Fled.
whatever they Cann't get at home.
we've got the whole thing ranged. If they come, we'll take 'em.
we can reacquire the subject. She'll be unaware of survelllance.
I am in control. I very much doubt it.
he is fully prepared for all possible contingencies. He will be fine.
that's up to me.
it's all in me. Something like that.
I will get it under control.
I had everything under control.
it went round and round in my head! Everything was spinning!
it all just became so clear to me.
shapes to melt into its own
everything looks the same to me. You don't know where you're going?
with a massage, everything is connected.
everything's under control, except one detail,
it's under control. don't worry.
it's all about losing yourself and just experiencing.
it ended with a chair.
they can believe all sorts of things about the other person that are just not true.
to end here, like this?
everything feels different here.
it was a peaceful moment of closure.
all in due time. Lovely. Yes. BIow.
search every acre of the high - grown field, and bring him to our eye.
everywhere.
it all started last spring,
everything's arranged.
I saw everything with my own eyes. What do you mean by "almost"?
from the covergirl queen collection.
this all began with the burning of pages
you got all swept up in the mad whirl of the city.
or anything bad anywhere ever again!
with modern society.
full transparency. Absolutely.
Oh, everything comes easy, right?
everything is kinda falling into place.
nothing much has really changed.
everything's... Louder.
things seem to be on the upswing.
that went well.
all will be as it was.
and everything will be the same.
it all gets pretty simple, doesn't it?
of the distractions of the outside world.
everything. - enough.
everything. Enough.
we have to exploit whatever talent is given to us and our talent is for dying.
everything's... God, good.
it was perfect.
everything. Great.
everything is just perfect.
and it was perfect. Romantic. We stayed up all night talking.
the world keeps on spinning.
it's over, Jenna.
seems quiet. No wolves so far.
she told me something totally crazy, but was too freaked out to find the words to explain it.
it's all so simple.
is all too strange.
everything he took too far.
it was too easy.
it's too late.
lost and found everything
all fail.
everything. The women and the drinking.
most everything woman... Have you seen her in the movies?
everything she could have been.
all right? I mean, the job.
good and loyal you've ever done.
and all the good that was done by the promotion gets washed away.
it's like the old days again, eh?
with everything ahead of us we left everything behind
wasn't it yesterday?
was that, like, insane, or what?
we seemed to have to start all over again.
everything feels.
everything seems really different.
brings it all back, you know?
and yet it all seemed to be happening in slow motion.
everything's just... Better.
nothing makes any sense.
nothing makes any sense. - Ohh, tangerine.
nothing makes any sense. It's okay. It's okay.
everything okay?
are you all right? How are you?
everything okay? Yes, sir.
everything'll be fine.
okay? We can work this... Fifteen minutes.
fortunately everything went well, did it not teodoro?
everything is... Perfect.
there was so much drama and chaos going on.
everything good.
everything's fine. Let's just -
it will be fine.
it was all very premeditated,
good luck and everything.
good luck with everything.
very best of luck, sir.
good luck getting out.
and may luck go with you.
will are recovered.
how is everything?
how's it going? You've got something for me.
how it all began
how's it going, miss drama?
all is prepared as you have asked.
any way you want it that's the way you need it
everything's as requested.
Thirgs'll go your way
did everything work out the way you wanted?
anything you want. Let's go.
everything is as you requested.
it was just as you said.
it will happen exactly as you planned.
everything is as it was.
it Didn't seem real.
normal?
nothing ever happens.
then like nothing ever happened, it's decorated with all sorts of stuff.
stick to our regular routine. Give nothing away. Not until we know what Lionel's up to.
everything's calm, Alexander Vasilievich.
all's quiet, but we can locate unit four.
is everything all right, mam?
same as ever? Yeah.
we're good... Just like this.
Noing's changed. I'm still the same person.
everything's OK, I went down the street and bought something
the usual. Anything good?
everything looks normal and she starts cleaning, wiping everything down.
it is what it is, and things are going to move very quickly now.
as always, your Majesty, so don't complain.
just the way you like it, sir.
it's all great. I'll tell you, man.
that hath all achieved!
and things are going the way I want them to.
that's all I ask.
whatever I want, right? Within reason, yes.
it went just as I expected.
it all worked beautifully just as I had planned.
just like before.
nothing's changed, so... I do have to go.
everything is just the same.
nothing's changed here. He still doesn't want children, and I still do.
everything went like clockwork.
everything. - if this is the key to everything.
it turned out so right
and this is how the message ran
it's all so clearly
it's all so familiar. My heart skips a beat.
and it was so bad, Cal.
everything felt so good,
just to think that something so beautiful
it all felt so easy and so good.
whatever Ellis grey wants.
it's totallYout of control.
and they sting like a lash, sir.
right on schedule, gentlemen. Keep it tight.
it's all to be expected.
everything's fine.
is everything set? - yeah, Jimmy's down with the two girls.
is everything set? Yeah, Jimmy's down with the two girls.
all wrapped up with a signed confession.
it started in 1945.
it started about, um, six years ago
it starts with a kiss
it all started as a routine traffic stop
and it all started last week, with a kiss.
this all started about two and a half years ago
it began around 4 billion years ago,
and it had everything to do with her.
I mean, it all started when she booked that out of London a few months ago.
it all started in the liver, but where in the liver?
hm, to think it all started with a bike.
that's where all this started. Maybe it's where it'll all stop.
why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be.
everything's temporary.
trains ran on time.
all clear, Sarge.
we're clear .- I don't know where you think you are,
clear. Stand down.
nothing, clear. Stand down.
all clear? - come on down.
all clear? - clear.
all secure. It talks to the refrigerator.
clear. Come on. - here you go
okay, we're clear. Let's go.
all clear. Copy that.
all clear! Check under the desk.
when it's safe.
coast is clear, let's go.
everything is secure, sir. - get in there and check it out right now!
all okay.
is everything all right?
everything looks good, but because he a month early,
what up, party people?
Yeah, everything's perfect. You're perfect.
everything was great. Do you have a dessert menu?
that's right. You are fine.
everything's fine. Just calm down.
so far, so good. - good to go.
don't worry, all is well.
is everything okay?
what's going on? It's been too long, mama.
is everything okay? Yes, and you?
is everything all right? - you tell me.
so everything's all right, huh?
everything all right, Mr. Fox?
everything is fine, my lady.
everything all right, gran?
all good, Eldad.
everything's fine. It's just a - a little plumbing issue.
is everything all right ?- yes, of course.
is all well? Very good. Thank you.
everything cool? Yeah, yeah, they're fine.
it's all good, or it will be.
just you make arrangements for that
everything settled then? Yes.
everything was arranged. Could he have gone abroad?
it's all taken care of.
you're all clear and ready to rock and roll.
ball is rolling.
our tactics were necessary. Now cIear out and let us do our job.
everything is fine!
and quiet,
when it got quiet.
and I don't want to tell her until I have everything set up.
it's over, Curtis.
and after everything's said and done, maybe we can get this bullet back to him as a souvenir.
it's going to be done exactly the way I've told Mr. Thatcher.
absolutely everything depends on you.
everything's gonna be all right. It's all good.
all secured. - okay.
you're good to go.
and everything's finally done.
when complete, report to your quarters
it went perfectly!
and it was perfect
everything just perfect.
everything that's official, maybe.
there is no certainty without evidence.
it's so weird how things work.
the rules which guide us in deciphering all secret writing
you made it look so easy.
everything's a joke with them.
everything for them is so simple. They start out with a clean slate.
he's too old for anything!
and everything's great,
since I started back to work,
everything's possible for you
everything's always a joke with you, isn't it?
everything is so new, so untouched for you.
is everything so easy for you?
everything in the world was new.
everything is still so new.
that everything is perfect for you.
everything worked to our advantage.
everything? Ja. I bench press 400 pounds.
nothing makes any sense to me! - you're not getting old.
I'm for anything that allows me to do my job.
everything was hard for me.
it's still really new.
the utter futility of everything.
everything's a joke to me.
everything is so strange here.
everything that was ever important to me here.
everything seems like nothing to me.
everything that is important in my life.
whatever's good for him is good for Nashville. - mm - hmm.
things are no longer going to unfold as I had feared.
then all matter will dissolve into nothingness.
the dance ends.
and nothing... Will ever be the same.
everything's going to be different!
it... Will... Be... Different.
everything will change for her.
it's all gonna turn off. What?
it's going to turn off, and it will never turn back on.
it's gonna happen, and you're gonna save her.
everything's gonna change,
everything would be so easy.
then all will follow in their wake.
how perfect everything would be.
things were going to return to normaI.
everything is about to change.
everything's gonna be okay.
it's going to be all right now, okay?
everything will begin anew.
it might get around that your bank is less than ideal, don't you think?
what's it going to be then?
nothing's ever gonna change.
it'd be nice.
and all would be right with the world.
it's all coming up after the break
and it all goes down tomorrow.
where we shall reenact it.
it's really going to shake things up,
everything is going according to plan.
everything will start to make sense.
everything's going to be just fine.
one thing will follow another.
everything that's -
everything's gonna be different now.
and everything will burn, doctor.
everything is falling apart.
this is all ending, this time of our lives.
it's gonna be magical.
its cloak of darkness over the world
we're almost at the finish line, my love.
everything would be settled.
little by little, everything will return to normal.
it'll all start again.
it will sweep us all away.
but it's in your hands.
be careful,
be careful.
watch your back, okay?
a necessary precaution.
be careful, Aram
and this whole thing goes away,
is that you look out for me once the dust settles.
everything's all right.
the future's not set.
it doesn't end.
this isn't over.
all is not lost, father.
everything's just fine and dandy
all attempts to recreate your mother.
all that changes.
it's gonna stop anything?
I know it wouldn't have happened.
if that original data had truly been destroyed.
and you start protecting her from them.
all of this for that.
so all this is about revenge.
all to save ten dollars a month?
is that what this is all about?
it all starts with a horse.
everything would be different.
then everything is different,
things would have been different.
that anything has really changed for us?
then everything gets mixed into the batch.
things will change.
that things would go back to the way they were.
the patterns become clear.
it would all become so real.
that it would all make sense, but.
everything's going to go back to normal.
all hell breaks loose and we'll never solve this.
everything would be fine.
it'll all be fine.
and I will feel all right
it'd be OK.
then everything would have been fine, but he's not.
everything would be different.
everything would change, but.
it will disappear forever
everything will be fine.
and all this will go away.
if you said the words.
that will end it all.
and it would all be over.
they start over, build their own pipeline.
and all will be well.
set up!
should all be in place by now, right?
everything is in place now.
everything is in position. He has entered
okay, chief. Here we go.
everything's in. Salad's almost done.
all tied up, one event to go, rifle range is our bread and butter -
take care of everything, the both of you.
run like a movie and you know I'm feeling all right
just like old times, huh?
it all checks out as you said.
it all went like you thought it would,
like it was happening all over again.
everything turned out just as we'd hoped. I love a happy ending.
just like the sign says... Herbs, spices, and teas.
as if a name means something,
it was a fantasy.
that whole kind of like the dark side of beauty.
everything changes.
this will all be finished.
it will all come out, and then, and then
it would all fall apart.
it all comes down to this, folks!
then it'll blow everything.
all in the time of a few waltzes.
and it happened backstage.
but that day is yesterday
this is where everything happens.
and everything changed.
he's never been the same. - Oh, no.
he's never been the same. Oh, no.
that everything would be fine?
the more everything is fine.
should be ready to back all these things.
a few months and everything will be the same.
tonight's the night.
it's actually passing you by.
everything's gonna start going our way.
and this is where it happens the first day.
this... Right here.
that's when it happened.
it's gonna be too late.
it's always just seemed so.
it was like nothing had ever changed.
it was as though he did not exist.
he was an easy target.
everything seems like a miracle.
become okay?
it played out exactly like I said.
everything would've been perfect.
it gets as dark and quiet as the grave.
and that'll be the end of it.
the game is over
then this is over, you're over!
all heck breaks loose. I'm out. Oh, leave it to the beaver.
that's the end of it, the end of the lineage.
and get it over with?
all would be golden.
what you had done to her.
if that son of a bitch disappeared.
that's in our manual.
that's when it all began -
everything starts to fall apart.
it moves up the chain.
this all will be over soon.
everything just goes back to the way it was?
cann't go back and change anything.
it'll be fine.
you're home.
home free.
we'll fuck it up. Right on.
and night becomes day.
as long as nobody conducts a probe into my tissue bank,
everything will work out.
and then it's game over, pal.
everything is everything.
everything is a dance.
all for this.
and all there is... Is now.
and it all starts with that candy apple.
that's where this all started?
that's where it all started for me.
that's when all started.
it's everything you are.
this is where it all happens.
right over there is where it all happened.
and everything is a lot.
that's what this is all about, isn't it?
this is - this is how everything works.
and that's how it all starts.
that's how this all started.
and that's just the way it is.
that's quite a story, huh?
so that's how it started.
it happened slowly, gradually. You hardly notice it.
and that's how it all started.
everything is beautiful.
well, that's when all this started.
that's how it all started.
it's going to be too late.
everything gets easier.
that's when the trail goes cold and I cann't find him.
and that is an end of it.
that that was it?!
I could make it work.
there is no case.
and everything will be all right.
it wouldn't have made any difference.
things have been a little less cheery around the house.
and we will be done with it.
and that then all would be clear.
and all that went away.
it'll all blow over, and you'll come work with me.
it's just, case closed.
it is out ofyour hands, white wolf.
OK. Set it up for tomorrow. How we doing for expenses?
then it all becomes very logical.
none of this ever existed.
if the police just had some proof.
we're ready.
and that's that.
then it will be done,
all set, chief.
everybody's ready!
is all in place?
was ready.
we're good. We're good. We've got everything.
Yeah, all set here. Rika?
all set, coutta?
everything's in place.
Ah, are we primed?
is everything in place? You weren't supposed to relieve me.
are we all right for it? Yes!
everything in order? Everything.
is everything under control?
bang! The deal is going to port, eh?
everything set, bough? Just about, sir.
everything's ready to mark the whore.
ready for launch, sir. Commander.
trap's set, ray.
Yes, master Oogway.
we'll let you know when we're there.
all right, you guys ready?
okay, all set. You can change.
we are all set. Your chariot awaits.
everything's set. What did you tell them?
got everything we need. Let's get this started.
standing by. Ready to tap and trace.
ready and standing by, sir.
we're ready, Mr. Cahill.
already done. Only unn refuses to comply.
we're all set up. All we need now is a location.
everything is ready for a test run.
all ready. Stage boat ready?
when they think she's ready, they buy her dresses.
they'll prepare me, then place me in my cryostat.
and with everything set, the urban fixing can commence.
we're all good. let's roll out.
it's all right, this.
areyou set? Uh - huh.
all ready for you to set them up. I even got the push pins you asked for.
and everything else is falling into place. Great.
we're set, boss.
all set! - all right.
all set! All right.
everything set. Good.
all set. okay. Go ahead.
we're up, baby.
Yeah, I got him all tuned up. Right, general?
all clear, general.
all is ready, general.
d to pull all sorts of strings to get us in.
we can move as soon as we're ready and armed.
you're all set nice and clean
all good? - yeah.
it's all clear. We're packing up.
plan's in place. We're almost there.
all set. We should get going. - have you read these studies?
everything's in place. Let's go.
are we in? Buckled?
all hands lay to. Raise the stabilizers!
everything's in place, Sarge.
all eyes are up. - sat cams are good.
path is stable, copy that.
ready as we'll ever be, stick.
everything's ready. Hayasaki San
everything set? Uh, yeah.
okay. All set, Mr. President.
the table's been set. Let's get to the main course.
and all's good to go. They then abandoned her.
she was prepped and everything, but the heart was flawed.
we're in position. Proceed.
it's down and locked.
ready to deploy, captain.
we're ready, sir. About damn time.
everything's copasetic, Herr Lehmann.
how long before everything's in place?
right, gentlemen, silence please. On the count of three.
all ready. This is gonna be a blast. Yay!
we have a go. Initiate gravitational spin.
ship ready. Give her Lee helm.
she's ready. Just set the date.
all set, sir.
everything's in place, ready to go.
set to jet, macgruber.
and things can go the right back to the way they were.
it can all go back to the way it was.
everything will go back to normal.
things can go back to normal,
everything kind of went haywire.
and the whole thing just began to flow.
it's about to go down.
and this is where it ends.
everything's gonna be okay.
it's all happening right now.
and ended things.
this will all be resolved.
just let fate take its course.
you will get over it. I'm living proof.
the sooner life gets back to normal.
the more it seems to contradict the actual experience of sight.
when you've got someone you can tell everything to. Yeah?
everything - it just happened.
it's all settled then.
so, this is all going to spin along from here.
and it all became real.
I still cannot believe that it's all over.
is that how it went down?
and it all leads to something else.
that's all over and done with,
is this how it's going to end?
and so it ended, not the way it does in comics, but the way it often does in real life.
the way it all worked out, don't you think?
it seems to grounding to a haIt in a minute.
it just happens.
and everything just got so easy.
and with everything that was going on
hardly a stretch.
it just happened.
things would be different.
it's rather a moot point.
and that would've made the timing work out right.
everything could go back to the way it was.
that everything would be okay.
it would make everything right again.
everything was clear.
and everything changes.
where everything changes,
it would all work out.
everything at your fingertips, but just out of reach.
everything that's been lost
and everything will just be fine.
and everything was alright.
and he'll be fine, right?
everything will come apart.
everything was back to normal again.
thanks for playing.
and make a real mess of everything, you know? Hey
nothing's ever the same.
it was clear -
then it will be too late.
and everything's going to be fine.
and this is all over.
it will all be for nothing.
everything fell into place.
it was all for nothing.
it's finished.
and that was that.
everything comes to an end?
and all of this will be over, okay?
it's all over, and I'll abide by that.
it'll all be gone, and I'm not prepared for that.
we can figure this out.
it would all make sense, at least for half an hour.
and all is forgiven. Makes me sick.
that's all it takes.
everything is exactly the way it should be.
okay, and everything's going to be okay.
and then the whole thing will just go away.
so everything else explainable,
everything's back on track. Let me talk to him.
that's all followed by 30 minutes of aerobics and 2 fish - oil capsules.
and all on the sixth anniversary of 9/11.
but obviously the gods have seen -
I don't have to say it
I don't have to say it
it's not about words.
words would ruin it,
without as much as a word, you've said everything, darling
where everything gets said but nobody's talking.
more than words - more than words
it's all ahead of them.
he just uses everything at his disposal. The movement, the music.
quality you can drive.
it's in the eye of the beholder.

I have it under control, okay?
I got it all under control.
I'm on top of it. - no, not so far, you're not.

I am handling this. Oh, God.
I got it. - okay.
all under control. Stand by for regular contact. Kirk out.
I can handle anything. Right? I am cobra.
looks like everything's under control. I'll take my break.

nothing you cann't handle. So, Mike.
it's under control. That's what Elias says.
everything is under control, I got everything.
it's all under control. It'll be a very fast clean - up.

eating out of your paw.
it all happens now on "big brother."
all in the comfort of our own living room.
all ahead on the primetime gave the we Emmys.
it's in the bag.
everything's in motion.
in a private, personal, exclusive interview.
I foretold you so!
it's all - access, man.
all is nothing. Therefore nothing must end.
it's gone.
it definitely shows.
so help you God? - no.
everything is significantly better than okay.
we will be up and running.
the whole encounter will be balanced on a razor.
everything is ready and set
everything stops.
everything comes to plan.
as ready as we'll ever be.
everything's been arranged
the wheels are already in motion,
all has turned to vain ambition.
it's all dust and ashes. Just like the song.
everything's arranged for me to stop the train.
bring us to green.
we're all saddled up. Anybody got an idea what the target is?
and there's an end to it.
there's nothing you can do about it.
there's just the way it is, and I cann't fix that,
it's all under control. Good.
everything cleaned.
there is no going back?.
it's too far gone.
nothing couId be done.
I've done everything you've asked me.
the secret is out!
agent McBride just became an open book.
all this has happened before
it's already happening.
all this has happened before and will happen again.
got to be lucid, vigilant.
everything's under control, sir. Okay, what's the time frame here?
it all just kind of happened.
yet so perfectly... Ly aligned
everything's ready.
Oh, yeah, and everything was in place -
it has begun.
enough is enough.
it already has.
nothing is holding us back.
it's what I did.
the fact remains, this is our fauIt, we made it happen:
things are as bad as they could possibly get.
it's already over.
it's over, you know that, right?
it's over, and they'd just be stupid tapes.
it's over. There is nothing you can do.
everything has already been decided. For that very reason. Show them!
so, all over then?
the clock is ticking.
all, Paris has everything,
finding the right place for everything?
this all seems quite ordinary.
everything an equal share as should be the location of the treasure too.
Yeah, everything's fine, sir. Please just stay in your seat. - yeah. Looks peachy.
everything shouId be okay.
everything looks quiet and normal. Nothing unusual to report at this time.
after it was over, I left town, alone.
it's plain as it can be
it's plain as it can be they thought of you and me
all cons are equal!
all this stuff about making everything equal.
clean as a whistle.
all is calm! All is bright! Around yon virgin mother and me!
all clear. You have go.
everything was quiet. So I ate my dinner in my shack.
everything. Our age, our memories, will be undone.
everything is not as it seems.
it's not how I thought it would be.
everything doesn't seem to appear like what it is.
everything isn't always so black and white.
it's not gonna be easy,
everything. I'll drop the case altogether.
it's never over.
it isn't the rest of the world that's wrong?
this isn't over, not yet.
it's not perfect.
everything comes to him -
everything could have changed. Our whole lives could have changed.
everything that should be forgiven is forgiven.
the spy world where everything
this is all happening, so much faster than I thought it would.
and it all began with a revolution in glass making in 16th century Venice.
it all started on a night like tonight.
it all begins with a dangerous hike
it started three weeks earlier.
it started three nights ago.
it all started a couple days ago.
it started at Stanford.
and all that begins right here.
they begin and they end.
everything started to come unglued.
everything started getting loud.
something not yet here has begun.
things are looking up.
it slowly faded.
things were coming to an end.
when it - when it started, it was just the money.
she was so little when all this started.
when it all started, please.
that's where I was the night all of this started.

steps had to be taken. And a verbal warning wouldn't suffice?
everything now depends upon the husband that woman takes.
from now on everything to do with this case goes through me, understood
everything depends on how we behave.
I guess you have to guess that on your own
we do this right.

all his precautions up in smoke.
when it's dead and gone
all that matters is the truth, and you don't have it.
everything's off the record.

let the grownups do their jobs; okay?
that all started with a big bang
we'll leave it up to her.
that's when it all began. The town went schizo.
just with my attitude, baby.
I'm in charge of it all.
it's totally up to me. She is so great. I miss her.
we will take what we wish, then decide whether to blow up your ship.

I started it.
this started with me. It ends with me.
I'll take care of it. You know nothing.
I'll take all the responsibility
I'll account for everything.
I'll deal with it, okay?
all starting from friendship.
that's how it started.
it begins with growing "blanks."
the evidence explains. - then help me find some evidence.
and electronic devices from their cases
then the pain will go away.
that's the narural position of nature.
all that pain and trauma.
about all of it -
all - all of it.
in all of this,
it all.
they even gave him the throne.
it's just been about getting my mom to love me.
just the size of everything.
all of that.If there's anything I can do -
and everything becomes chaos
like everything. You're elght years old and like you had a house burning down,
everything, I seriously went to another planet.
all in all. I feel pretty good about myself.
houses, cars, theaters, restaurants, even the people -
everything, this whole food chain, is fed by the flowering plants.
the, you know, the whole thing. Oh, yeah.
everything. He simply couldn't stand the idea that there were elements in the world that he couldn't order around.
everything! All right?
none of this would have happened.
all happening simultaneously.
you know, happening simultaneously.
everything will fall apart.
thank you for everything.
leave it all behind.
everything, get me data. Right.
it's all a question of balance.
and all of it, lovey - dovey.
that it's all for nothing.
everything goes boom with it
everything everywhere seems to get worse and worse,
this has all been a big mistake.
that kind of confirmed everything.
this is the beginning for everything.
I rest my case, your honor.
nothing is turning out the way I thought it would.
everything except you.
everything you see, all of it, really, is her.
all sorts of things.
it's kind of like that "tree falling in the forest" thing.
everything depends upon the element of surprise.
is it possible that the mind is all that matters,
it'd be worth the risk.
it happened overnight.
it all happened for a reason.
this is happening because they left.
all programmed options,
big gay al, and all gays, into their club!
and crossly to thy good all fortune goes.
everything's in the bag? Yeah.
all sounds, the oboe, the flute praise you.

it could all be taken away.
all that emotion... It wipes you out.
everything meaning.
everything feels different.

the source of all, the monster's power,
the greatest hits.
that all that other stuff, that it's all over.
all reality, all life merges into a sign
all the love and familiarity are gone
physical illness - Oh, thank you - is - is due to some, you know, mental weakness.
all the craziness, the partying, the sex, the drinking, it sounds incredible.
all the rest of the symptoms can be explained by a severe long - term allergic reaction.
everything I've studied and learned will be yours
everything bad that has happened, you bring.
the science of it all beguiled her.
all will be revealed in time. I promise.
all will be revealed in time.
all roads lead back to the same simple, sad fact.
the end of everything.
all your sins can be forgiven
the glory belongs to Allah.
all these cuts, the reconfiguring,
the responsibility and possibility.
I'll pay for the bill
any and all resources are at your fingertips.
Hey, all this started because you people lied to us.
and the source of all,
what started all of this was the 35 years
believable that they seem to leap off the page.
an end in itself.
it was worth it,
trusted to run it all.
it will answer everything. I promise.
that will solve everything! I've had it!

for the purpose of causality violation.
it's a controlled environment.
just say the word.
everything inappropriate and foolish
and seeing things in a dream.
this is where it all starts.
everything was falling into place.
everything goes in cycles.
it all turns on a dime.
nothing but love, love, love.

possibilities are endless, man.
could be anything. All right, stop it.
the possibilities are endless, right?

anything can happen, hmm?
lots of possibilities Yep. You never know.
it's possible. Yes? Or no?
anything's possible, even Santa Claus. Why?
anything is possible.

it all has a purpose. I don't know.
there are no coincidences.
everything is connected.
everythings unknown, there is no recipe.
it all comes back to love.
that all started with a big bang
it all starts in the mind.
everything is made of energy. Albert elnsteln -
all people's worries are all thanks to this crazy heart
all because I was standing in an elevator in Tokyo.
and nothing is as I wished.
you never wished for this.
precision is all, mum.
everything. For now.
everything that matters has been destroyed. We're good to go.
and all relevant files to our custody.
everything across the board.

everything is so tall and grand.
it's like nothing happened.
everything totally credible - devoid of human error.

all truths are easy to understand once they are discovered.
this is actually happening, and I'm blowing it.
is that all you really want? # - no, no, no
it's true that some things are better left unsaid.
everything's gonna be really good from now on, okay?
everything is truly beautiful
and things aren't looking very good, it's true
it actually does.
it was bad, really bad.
is this thing really over?
disclosure smoke and mirrors.
when the truth is found to be lies
everything is covered up.
everything moves so fast.
everything about this guy says he did it.
the root of all knowledge.
all knowledge is a double - edged sword.
everything. You know?
questions to make sure we're providing a safe and healthy environment for you.

I did start the scandal.
that it was all their fault.
all undetected, then we might have a fight on our hands.
all the sacred spirits.
everything you need to know about the mysterious and the unexplained.
quiet on all fronts.
it was all pretty good.
everything was moving so fast. So fast.
it was all legitimate.
VitaIs appear stable.
and things were steady. Things were good.
the thing was stable and then it disappeared.
well, she's stable, so soon as she wakes up,
how did that happen?
how is that ever gonna happen?
all available doctors and security personnel to the E.R. Immediately.
it's all happening really quickly.
suddenly seemed very dear to me
suddenly everything became clear.
makes it all real.
and suddenly things felt different.
it suddenly stopped.
take control right away and keep it going.
until you hit the three - month mark.
my big pay off better be worth it. Samantha, I don't understand you.
whole thing comes crumbling down.
let's talk about the marriage after my son's return.
promise you won't tell her until I'm back home.
this is full of answers.
all the answers are in that house.
I mean, all strategy changes mean? You know what?
it was a complete nightmare.
faster than you can say, "fetch," it brings me great delight
and so forth.
all systems normal, Houston.
where I'm no fun anymore
twisted every way, what answer can I give?
a fortunate coincidence for all involved.
everything points in the same direction.
it was all about the car in the end.
bottom line is the trail leads me to you and your company. I want to know the truth!
this is where it all leads.
everything points to the fact that
everything is traceable back to Mickey
all the little things.
details, route, just a different date.
the nuances are just too similar.
everything fits: the coast guard report.
we'd agreed on everything up to the last detall.
it's finally clear
I'm just glad that it's over.
so this... So this is finally over.
this finally makes sense.
everything's finally starting to work out.
Oh, we're done.
everything turns out all right
the time will come and you, my dear,
thy will be done.
and everything shall be as it was.
your rainbow will come smiling through
everything will turn out alright.
this is all going to come apart.
all things end in judgment.
shadows and dust.
nothing stays buried forever.
that's always going to be true.
so everything ended well after all.
when it was over,
keep lady Essex here until it is all over.
when it was all done,
when this is all over.
when you're finished.
and when it was all over, God cast the rebels into perdition.
after all this is over, she's still gonna forgive you.
and if by the end of it we still like each other, then maybe it's the real thing.
we'll probably have sex afterwards.
done?
full stop.
it's all over. Get down here.
it's over. You'll be pleased.
you must be relieved that it's over.
it's all over, all over. back off!
so it's over?
so it's over. Yeah.
it's over. She's gotta go.
it's over. Bring him up.
it's over, drop it!
it's behind me now. And that's all I care about.
after all this gets over
when this is over, are you coming back?
when all this is over, I'm going to find her.
what do you do When it's all over?
we're done. You can go back home. No hard feelings. One week.
don't bother calling me to come back until it's all over.
one final loose end to tie up before putting all this behind me.
and when it's over.
when this is all over, there will be no more Jews in Alexandria.
when you're done here, your memories will be wiped and you'll be able... Doctor?
when it is over, what happens with your life?
you've got a life to go back to at the end of this.
some of the sweetest moments come when the job ends
we'll find you when is clear.
when all this is over I'll come back for you, I swear.
I'll be doing better once this is over.
I feel somehow I'll just keep going on even after it's over, like Hillary.
I'll make it up to her after this is all over.
I'll come for you when it's over.
and when it's done, I disappear into the night, knowing you are forever mine.
when it was over I thanked her.
after this is over, I go back to prison.
as soon as this is all over, I'm gonna find you. OK? I promise.
when this is over, my men get to drink for free!
when this is all over, you can arrest me all you want,
when it was officially over, he left.
call me when it's over. all right.
we'll come back when it's over.
we'll see who's got an Academy when this is over.
and in the end when its over all that matters is what you have done.
and in the end, when it's over, all that matters is what you've done.
and after this thing is said and done, it might be the only place that survives.
everything came back completely normal.
everything. Give me the car key, please.
nothing's by accident. Exactly.
it all started a week ago.
all offences, my Lord, come from the heart.
everything that was beautiful, has become ugly.
every location beautiful in a way.
everything that is good,
the enemy of everything that is good,
she was all of those things, and now she's gone.
everything is beautiful. There's nothing to worry about.
perfect relationships end in ruin.
to have good things and a good life.
we have the whole world right in... Right in front of us.
beautiful things die in tree hill.
and hope for the good within us all
the beginning of everything great.
all good things come to those who can
all this is great. It touched every moment of her life,
best thing I did was go.
Yeah, that was cool.
everything is the same. He was wondering about you.
lord Grantham will decide what's to be done.
everything! - and you loved it.
contact you've called and password you've used.
all things wise and wonderful
everything began after we started experimenting with radiation.
but whatever can be done for your comfort will be done.
what I will need to win my war.
anything and everything. Got it
whatever can go wrong will go wrong.
and everything would go back to the way it was before I drove a wedge between them.
all that sets men in motion
anything that'll help us figure out what he was up to.
anything that could help us find her.
anything that might help us track her.
anything smuggle - able, I smuggle, all right?
anything that might give us a clue.
you scrap anything that they can use against you.
everything about me invites you in,
any thing that makes sick it.
that what is good for the goose, is good for the philanderer
I want all available units out looking for her.
anything smuggle - able, I smuggle.
this is all gonna work itself out. No need to rush into anything.
God has fixed everything.
the ways of God in nature, as in providence, are not our ways.
there is a natural order to things, and by the time they go, you're ready.
and a time to every purpose under the heaven.
then it'll all make sense.
things have just been working out.
and then, all this.
it went okay.
all in good time, my dear.
that's the makings of every great relationship.
it all comes down to a matter of trust,
if it ends, it ends.
haven't seen the end of it yet
to whatever drugs he wants.
the phoney must die, says" the catcher in the rye ."
every action has its consequence.
the instructions are to engage only on my command.
all must be done as one.
nothing will change operationally.
every movement will be under protocol "escape and evade."
this has to be kept quiet.
everything will be run through NSA. Who controls faheen?
cann't make a decision unless the computer gives you the go - ahead.
soon it will be too late.
he's manipulating the grid.
anything else that's got frostbitten, particularly your manhood, might swell.
everything that was taken from us.
@ answers still are left behind @
and those memories are locked deep in your mind,
everything, swallowed by the whale.
it all started 27 years ago.
well... It all started with ice cream.
it all started a few weeks ago.
it all started ten years earlier.
had to learn everything again.
Yeah, it all started about two months before we got married.
it started with my father, gently proudbeast.
it's kind of like starting at square one.
it ends today.
I've moved on. You should do the same.
it'll have to happen in, what, five seconds?
so you all have to be careful
after investigators recelved a tip from an informant,
if only it were that easy, right?
it has to be different, you must adapt to changing times.
I'm only as good as whatever happens next season.
everything depends on God.
all the tumblers clicking into place.

we'll know.
it's all going to hell.

whole thing's gone down the toilet.
whatever's got you so scared.
everything that made it good

I got everything.
and everything you know is gone.

and traces of paint under his nalls indicate that the kid tried to escape.
ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.
everything points to Olivia.
any evidence that's here is gone.
evidence will go into a banker's box and be filed away,
any curse can be broken.
and it is exactly as was rumored.
all those words
that'll be enough of that.
this is about family.
this was supposed to be over.
the whole darn shooting match could go over tea kettle.
nothing has to change.
let's finish this now.
I'm so happy that we cleared that up.
all the misunderstandings will be cleared.
things weren't adding up.
uh, "any" is kind of a broad word.
bigotry is boring when we add modifiers.
all will be unmasked.
and everything is laid bare.
we have the how and the why, now we just need the who.
thanks for everything.
it was like I was in one of his movies.
all possums go to heaven.
everything's in my name... Always was.
I'll accept the responsibility. Just turn off the lights!
and how I account for every penny.
consider your stay on us.
everything. Paid for the operation. It cost you?
the boxing Commission's paying for all this. Everything.
everything!
look, I've got everything right here.
you'll have every means at your disposal,
grab everything! Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!
that would be gone,
all praise to Allah.
everything! Get out!
everything must be this way

this has got nothing to do with you.
it happened just like you said it would.
everything about anything alien, he's supposed to know.
everything's just like we discussed
nothing has changed around here
that follows the prophecy,
leave... Hey, leave Mac out of this.
it'll work against all small - arms ammunition,
turn back reverse return
all that hard work, all that had been achieved,
it was over quickly.
you were what remained when it had passed.
everything that is and was and will be, is everywhere.
things do seem to be running quite smoothly. Exactly.
status is good.
looking good to us, over.
to go all the way around! When everything's so close.
how's it going ?
and everything would be like old times?
could it be worse
and everything will be just the way it was.
will it be the same?
nothing's changed since I was a boy.
nothing will be different.
it's just the same!
it's still happening.
everything's under control, sir. Our units are in position. Go time is ten minutes.
it's an ongoing investigation.

everything will continue.
he still covered his bets.
so everything... Is exactly the same. Nothing changed.
everything is just as normal and boring as it's ever been.
the situation is still in control.
is not knowing.
it's still not over.
everything will go on as before.
the judges laid down the law.
everything is still a little blurry.
nothing had changed.
nothing's changed. You have to trust that.
if we all just come clean.
the whole thing remains mysterious.
it's still coming through.
which remained a mystery.
everything... One takeover is still left.
there's much to be learned still,
this might not be a dead end. He's got may.
nothing is set, honey.
you know, nothing's a sure thing.
nothing's been confirmed. They probably don't know themselves yet.
it's not over yet.
it's still not over
it isn't finished. Oh yes, it's finished.
you may already be Cho's bride.

the way everything works. Mathematics.

well, all indications are everybody is safe.
and all indications point to their being swept with the tide.
all the omens point to him.
all the symptoms are consistent with poisoning.
everything said that he was gonna be there and.
everything points to a solitary existence.
nothing but the best
all communications are terminated.
all communications are down.
everything would beabcdrifting apart.
everything that was go and hidden to light.
the whole of creation would change forever.
the logical signs point to suicide, don't they?
anything you say.
their faith put in praxis. Praxis?
I felt terrible.
naturally, expressing everything
it was so easy,
everything? The money, the castles, the jewellery?
all that is evil, all that have eyes.
all that is evil, all that have eyes.
depart, every demonic power.
all could see that they had vanquished the evil.
all evil comes from them. So do the good tings, don't they?
everything was fully functional except the air bags. They were turned off.
it's gonna be... It's gonna be good.
things took a turn. It's kind of crazy.
and things will never be the same.
everything got so screwed up.
that all things will go on as they have before,
I've made my way quite well, actually.
everything's the same, except one little difference
everything's the same, except for one change
everything's duplicated.
I mean, everything is the same.
it's obvious.
the slate could be wiped clean.
everything has to be just so.
everything's upside down -
so everything's on track, right?
everything is coming together as a result.
everything's on course. Okay. Cadet Lovell.
and everything was... Different.
and things started to change.
and, well, things Haven't been the same
nothing will ever be the same! Nothing! I'm going now.
this is new, all of this, for the both of us.
and things are changing for me. It's like the era of yes has begun.
things just - things just seem different.
everything's different!
not ever again. Never. Done. Forty.
nothing is ever going to be okay again.
everything would be perfect.
it is never gonna happen.
everything stands.
nothing's going to change.
nothing's going to get any better.
none of that's going to change.
everything is not going to be cool.
none of it would have ever happened.
have things never change.
everything is going to be fine.
everything's gonna be all right. Okay?
everything's gonna be Justine.
everything's gonna be all right.
and none of this will have made a blind bit of difference.
everything will be taken care of.
everything's gonna be fine. I promise.
this will not be in vain!
nothing ends.
it's all worthless.
well, it all keeps spinning, spinning round and round
there's nothing you could've done.
there's nothing you could've done. I could've told you the truth.
never again. I am tired of bending over.
I cann't... Control it all, anymore.
nothing was a mystery anymore.
none of it makes sense anymore.
nothing makes sense anymore.
nothing normal is.
nothing scares me anymore!
nothing was out of reach.
and everything doesn't have to be so difficuIt anymore.
it's not good enough. It's a nightmare.
nothing is going to change.
nothing I believed made sense anymore.
none of this would have been possible.
and all that became impossible.
nothing's ever gonna be the same.
everything's different, remember, because the ship's upside down.
everything's different. Basilio, stay put!
everything is different, my Lord.
everything was different. At home everything was different.
reckless.
it's just absence.
and when that's gone.
this is all wrong. What's wrong?
everything's getting so uncomfortable.
everything is not okay.
it can never be right.
everything's not fine. Got it?
everything's not fine. Got it?
everything's not all right. These two people cut in front of me.
things are not turning out as we expected.
it was all pretty convincing,
none of it's easy.
everything is wrong.
everything is strange.
everything's wrong. You're living like a sharecropper.
everything, man. We were bleeding money.
nothing's working.
this is not how it's supposed to be!
I don't want you to change anything.
all out of questions?
none of it is.
nothing is what it seems.
I know it, you know, really wasn't your fauIt or anything.
nothing is accidental.
and it's not her fault. Actually, you know what?
I Didn't imagine it!
nothing's like it used to be.
not that it really matters anymore, does it?
it all went so wrong.
none of this was my decision.
I Didn't mean to do anything!
and none of this is real.
everything is not so simple. It is something like huge garage.
everything's wrong. Everything's wrong.
do not worry everything
everything was perfect,
very uncertain.
and nothing is too much trouble.
this is all beyond me.
and we cann't afford to stop now,
nothing comes out.
there are no guarantees.
nothing's gonna get in the way or stop me.
nothing natural about it.
everything was gone.
it should not have happened.
it wasn't supposed to be like this.
none of this matters
nothing mattered.
doesn't matter, Jimmy.
nothing else in the world matters right now, Caroline.
everything's fine, though.
it was all right.
so good, right?
is every - everything cool?
everything's good and mum's great.
things are good. I got that coaching job.
everything's pretty much business as usual.
which sounds great except she proceeded to punch me in the face.
it isn't necessary that everything is said.
all in harmony with his sadness, and some in praise of dulcinea
it's all turned around on you.
it's all turned around on you. It never will. Suddenly you are old.
it's none of your damn business.
nothing was as it seemed.
everything exactly as it was when I had left over four years ago.
it is all about her.
it turns out that it's all to do with the number of electrons
everything was different.
it was all by the enigma?
everything's the same as it was.
it's all about speed, isn't it? One thing to another, never standing still.
nothing looks exactly the way I left it.
this is not about the outfit.
but it was all for one magnificent goal,
it's all been leading up to this.
and asks no omen but his country's cause.
and for the corporations.
anything for you girl, and since you left the party, I brought the party to you. Hmm?
everything is about conserving energy.
to protect her.
anything for the brothers.
everything for the chiIdren. 50-50.
it is all for charity.
anything for charity, and anything for my man.
a vehicle for my real experiments.
for democracy.
anything for an old amigo.
anything and everything for chief.
anything to keep our attention off her.
everything is about winning, even in death.
everything is done for you.
and the party's all for me
justice and equality for all. Take a copy of the proclamation.
everything's fruity in the loops
everything's just fucked up.
everything is so confusing.
it's fucked up, isn't it?
all hell broke loose.
it's all gotten messed up and derailed again.
it was a mess. I had to clean it up.
everything's gone down the tubes, and no one knows why.
it all went wrong from there. Tears just started to flow.
that was pretty messed up.
and all hell broke loose.
the whole thing. Bloody madness!
everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand!
everything was crazy. It was in a barn.
everything got screwed up, and I snapped. And I don't care.
everything's gone haywire. And it's all your fault!
it was total chaos.
it's a total mess!
everything's a mess. My queen!
this is so messed up, man!
nothing is fun.
tie perfectly knotted.
everything happens for a reason, right?
that's not how it works.
everything's connected, right?
and everything's organized.
everything is in the best of order,
everything was shipshape. Oh, Frank.
it was all in order. Seals, signatures, everything.
everything is just as it should be. Thank you, miss.
everything's under control. How can we help you?
it went pretty well, huh?
everything is quite in order here, Lord Emsworth.
it is all yours now, do me proud.
it's all yours now. All right, get this thing up!
left everything to me.
so I can deal with it
you leave everything to me, grasshopper.
it all started with a phone call.
it all began last week. I was sitting in Mrs miggins' coffee shop when.
so, it all started with "the next call of duty" game.
it all began at the Plaza hotel.
everything started with the disappearance of my uncle.
it all started with my uncle Derek. He was a sergeant in the met.
it all started when the bride asked to see me.
it started with a chair.
everything that happens is from now on
everything comes from now.
it begins just one year from the time of the murder.
where it all begins.
things go down hill from there.
and it all begins here.
it all started here,
everything began on that day.
everything started there.
it all starts with the mail.
well, it all started when Ricky tried to seduce me.
it was fucked up, right?
shit's a little off, right?
everything just fucking happens.
all bleeding coming together.
all bleeding coming together, innit, all bleeding coming together.
it's all bleeding coming together. Innit, Ravi?
it's all gonna bleeding come together, innit?
this is all very exciting.
it's all going to go down.
what's not to like?
it takes your breath away.
everything feels really comfortable.
everything seems satisfactory.
there's too much confusion
there's too much confusion
everything is bomb and glamorous.
we did the whole touchy - feely thing, right?
it's aIways about them. How do you propose to do that?
only those I hold for my church'st. Peter's church.
it's all in the name of freedom.
and everything revolves around the humble sardine.
depending on people with whom they stayed for hospitality, for food.
everything depends on one big battle, just like at marengo.
everything gonna be.
everything is OK
you'll be on your way.
makes a difference.
everything we knew is a long time ago.
everything would have been different.
everything will change.

all in good time, when I'm finished with it.
this is all it'll take.
nothing is ever going to be the same.
nothing stays the same.

things will just go back to the way they've always been, with a new big brother and a new me.
everything would be the same
then the whole cycle can start over again.
it will all start again like when mam died.

everything seemed more real. The guys in their uniforms.
it's your world and we all just live in it?
and everything that makes you wonder.
got a confession and everything
everything is riding on it.
as required by law. You're not going to find anything criminal here.
everything's right on schedule.
his mission proceeds as planned, Majesty
and relying on you for everything.
lied on it for everything.
everything's the same except for one important detail.
everything's exactly as it was.
they'd just pick up where they left off.
and turns wonderful into shit,
all of it's worth it.
it makes it all worth it. Well, you did it.
here goes everything.
it'll all be worth it?
is it worth it?
congratulations on everything.
all solved.
all came to dead stop.
nothing's working, sir.
there was no movement, no life.
all that stopped.
everything just stopped and went pitch black.
and everything stopped like a moment out of time.
everything stopped working. We weren't prepared.
everything stopped working.
everything stopped working.We weren't prepared.
it's been storybook.
everything felt as familiar as if we'd never been away.
it's all the same.
it'll all be the same. That's what we want, right?
everything went exactly as you said.
everything slowly faded into an endless tunnel.
everything's been, like, right there in front of me,
and everything went just as we plan.
everything is working out Just the way I told them.
it played out exactly like I said
everything seems real.
it all feels wrong.
and it's all gone like a dream.
everything appears real, but it's all been worked out in advance?
everything was heightened. I have that.
everything went to damnation.
I have no say in it, Gibbs.
it's so full of erotic imagination. Okay, hold on a sec.
all is bright.
looking at a world full of question marks,
nothing makes sense.
all above board now.
it's all above board, guys.
everything is public record.
it's about race.
it's just about evidence.
that it's all about the body and nothing at all to do with the brain.
it all got down to me and the octopus.
it's all about ratings, fast cars, pretty women.
all that matters is to be with the one you love.
it's all connected.
everything seemed very clear.
everything's just as it should be.
it's written all over his face.
everything I got is in the file he's reading.
it's written all over your puppy dog face.
it's written all over your face.
everything is explained in the letter.
and I write everything down in my book. Is that understood?
it's all over their faces,
it's written all over your face - all those tics and hesitations.
everything was as it was meant to be.
he just washed it all away.
everything freezes,
all greased up and ready to go.
and everything is ready
I have everything.
everything's covered,
everything's prepared. Do not be worried.

everything's ready, Enrique.
everything's set. I'm heading there now.
everything possible is on the line, including your manhood.
is everything ready? Yep, Yep.
everything's ready. Just take a look at it.
everything is ready, sir. Go ahead.
everything's ready for the quail hunt!
all things are ready if our minds be so
everything is prepared.
everything's ready, the room, the bathroom.
by the time the assauIt teams are in position, we'll have no idea where he is.
and so everything was set.
everything else is good to go.
is everything set? Huh?
all ready to mobilise, except no one's saying why.
in readiness for an immediate departure?
getting enough of these projects up and running will take people.
all the preparations have been completed. The team is all ready.
all that's prepared and in - hand? - there is planking on the backside.
everything's torn apart.
evertyhing is set
it's all set.
everything's taken care of.
all done?
it's already done. Look at you!
guess all bets are off, huh?
everything moved up. The board wants things done ASAP
but by then it's too late and we go at it like animaIs.
everything is moving so quickly,
it's all being spirited away by this... Capricious man.
and was gone.
nothing has been made clear.
everything seems to be under control!
everything is upside down, Henri. An old world has crumbled,
this experience was nothing but intense.
everything is so fragile right now.
so, it's all synched up?
took everything he had. Including the kid.
all lived. Back through life
because it's still there, and sitting at the same table.
everything is intact.
everything feels a little upside - down, but I am happy for you.
well, everything's been so expedited, you know.
everything is going perfectly.
and everything that's happened.
I guess everything happened.
it's all happening, isn't it?
and that happens in a split second.
that all took place within the space of a pop song.
that all took place within the space of a pop song,
all of that happened to you.
it's been happening all around you
it's all set in Iceland, which is where he must've gone.
all before we started chemo.
it's all happening to me.
everything happens right now.
happened so fast.
this is where it all went down.
it's all about that night.
this is all happening way too fast, and I need to think.
it all happened so quickly.
everything turned upside - down for me.
this is all happening pretty fast.
it all happened so fast.
it all happens so quickly
everything happened so suddenly.
it all happened so fast, but now it all makes sense.
it's all happening too soon - you moving in,
everything happened quickly.
it happened so fast. It came out of nowhere.. He had that thing in his hand,
everything happened so fast. Just like what I saw here,
I just it all happened so fast, I'm not even used to the idea yet.
that it's happening pretty fast.
it all happened so fast. That guy.
before I knew what was happening, he put this cloth over my mouth, which had this chemical smell,
everything's happening so fast. You've just gotta stick by me here.
it all happened so fast. It was dark.
things are happening fast now, honey. I'm traveling a lot.
it all happened too fast. I was overwhelmed by you.
it just kind of happened.
it's all happening so fast.
everything happened so quickly.
everything happened in such a hurry.
no, it's just that this is all happening so quickly.
it happened so fast.
it happened so fast. You know, you been working for me for two months.
it happened pretty fast.
where it all happens, yeah.
everything happened so fast, I know,
the whole thing just happened so fast.
Italize in the hands of the people vote out this late and become jury members.
it's always been your choice.
all depends on what it is you're trying to teach.
it depends why you're staying.
it all depends on how you respond to my next two words.
it comes down to one thing - what you decide to do with it.
that depends on your vote.
it starts with you. I'm sure she appreciated that.
and it all starts to come down to three counties in Ohio.
everything is resting upon it.
everything rests with what's on that recording.
it's all up to us. We have choices -
it's all based on whether or not we have chemistry.
it's all about the desk.
everything depends on this. Everything. Okay.
it's all what you do in the moment, baby.
it all depends on the secret.
everything depends on it
everything is riding on this dress.
and it all hung on a single question, is white light pure?
it's all about the powder
all that's changed.
and suddenly it was all different
everything has changed
nothing would be the same.
everything is different. Everything is gone. No.
it all just changed. - what?
a lot sure has changed
all is changed, sir. I must leave you.
everything has changed... Including me.
everything has changed.
well, everything's changing, huh?
things have changed. - uh - huh.
everything changes because at first,
it's really different, I.
things have changed... And I accept that.
it changes everything. I'm gonna be up all night.
things change. We all need to grow up, right?
things have changed. I've changed. What do you want from me?
everything has changed. I got lysine up and running. The virus is gone.
everything's changed, my hairstyle most definitely
everything just feels different. - I cann't wait to feel different.
it all went wrong, Didn't it? uh.
everything! Yes, everything you're used to.
things have changed, Tom.
everything is different, Mr. Teacher. And we were afraid.
today it's all gone. A whale shows up with $4 million in a suitcase.
there have been too many distractiss.
it's all moving kind of fast.
everything's been spinning so fast
it's all changing so fast.
everything went sour. She found a man her own age.
it's been more complicated than it really needs to be.
everything felt better.
it's all good, doctor.
everything's getting better, but he's getting sicker.
always makes it easy
everything's different now.
things were different.
nothing is like it was.
suddenly, everything made sense.
it's all gotten so... Complicated.
and it got too real, Didn't it?
it's as natural as the air we breathe.
and it's all become so.
everything was more real and less real at the same time.
all turn out for the best.
and it's all just tedious and horrible and terrible
it quickly became clear that they could live anywhere as long as they lived together.
everything goes crazy.
suddenly it all became so clear.
everything feels enormous, like it's all.
none of that seemed to matter anymore.
everything - everything's very clear to me now.
everything's brown and, uh - Oh, I feel sick
it was so meaningless.
everything else fades.
that led us into chaos.
everything mixed up. Fragmented.
all else seems inconsequential.
it all went mad!
everything else is easy.
everything becomes easier, and I am in, baby.
we just like made it really slow and still,
and everything's kind of awesome.
this all came hard and at the cost, I'm sure,
things are getting even colder.
everything get so screwed up?
it's all becoming so bland.
everything just fell into place.
Oh everything spins from fucking control.
everything moves faster or slower.
everything slows down.
it remains unexplained
everything has been broken into pieces.
everything just turned red.
it's turned into a goddamn Whopper of a chopper opera.
I cann't avoid it anymore. It's real.
it all went up, everything.
and then everything went white.
and it got too real, Didn't it? You chickened out.
it totally makes sense, okay?
it was all gonna be simple.
and everything went bad.
everything's more expensive now.
what happens is always and only between you and her. Do you see?
everything was just so perfect.
I'm faking this whole thing.
it was all about the mistletoe.
it's all about the bottom line.
everything is show biz
the whole thing's just a routine.
it's a scam, okay?
it's all circumstantial. Yeah, but it's good circumstantial.
I needed something to fill me up when I was on my own.
everything has been a one -way street,
anything.
make things the way we want them to be.
everything was understood.
I think we can start over.
and all is forgiven - ish.
nothing that cann't be denied.
and all will be right with the world.
so things can go back to the way they were.
and everything else would work as planned.
all gonna work out.
nothing is irreversible.
it's only gonna work if... If Whistler cooperates.
everything's negotiable.
I'll teach you everything you need to know.
can go back to the way it was.
everything will be made clean again,
everything's rideable, everything's doable in some way or another.
it all comes down to simple mathematics.
it can all end right now.
everything could be heightened.
we'll get this sorted out right away.
we'll get this all straightened out.
I believe in second chances.
anything but clothes?
it was going to be fine. But it ain't.
they can take everything away, these carpets, columns, houses,
look, everything can be taken back.
everything could have been different.
what if it was over for me, I didn't have an option to fail.
things can be changed.
things may change.
all these might be connected.
and anything that can be, will be, somewhere in the multiverse.
the whole thing could start again.
all things in their proper place.
everything is where it should be.
everything entirely logical, right down to the building of the camp,
is everything in order?
justifiable homicide. No one's saying you're getting off,
it all made perfect sense, because that's what I saw.
is everything legal? Yeah, it's legal, it's just.
it's the same with everything.
all is the same as before,
way to look on the bright side.
my family is really, really happy for me.
you're in charge.
follow her lead,
that's why you're in charge, sir.
it just seems... Listen.
everything matches.
everything fits: he's a Gemini and an aspiring engineer.
everything's, uh... Is fine.
all about me.
everything, it's telling you that this is thin and poor soil.
it's all about the team of me.
that things could be as exactly as they were before.
everything is exactly the same.
no more than there was yesterday. Dude, you made her pancakes?
everything's been different.
nothing is the same as before
it's all about the burn notice with you, isn't it?
everything's exactly as you left it.
it's all about her
this has nothing to do with Francesca and how pretty she is.
everything's exactly the same.
like everything our world was about to become,
nothing's turned out like I thought.
dramatic effect, I guess. Or perhaps I've developed a warped sense of humor.
exactly the way it did last time.
it's all about money.
like it comes easy for me.
ketchup on everything, ketchup on everything
it all came apart.
and things will never be the same.
the time had come for the grand return.
everything is back in its box.
it's going to be back the way it was.
and everything went back the way it used to be.
all's right with the world.
everything's back to the way it used to be.
you know, like - like we're getting back to normal.
and all is right in the world.
he thought things were back to normal.
it all came back to me
it came back to me.
all because he dared to dream tonight. - Yes! Yes!
all because he dared to dream tonight. Yes! Yes!
all because of you
and all because you picked up a doctor who happens to be a fake.
all because we Didn't listen to her.
and all attributed to natural causes.
everything started with the village.
all because of that man who came here.
it's all the goddamned money.
it's all the goddamn money, ed Tom. Money and the drugs.
everything feels so different with you here.
a lot of this is because of you.
what, all this come down to just jealousy?
it was all caused by my dreams.
which is all because of me. So let's face it, I owe you.
I'm the reason this happened. Not you.
this all started when I began my affair with Vanessa.
everything comes to he who fights.
everything comes to he who fights, my friend.
it begins with a dream
everything always come back to that.
all around you, the power of God is pushing out of a community which is
Ah, it shouldn't always be about science.
everything's all.
nothing's gone.
it contains everything.
everything is... Happening.
Hey, it's all about choices.
it's all about forgiveness.
it's in the heartbeat.
it's all about the details.
everything happens today.
so everything is on the line for me today.
he has everything under control.
he had it all planned years in advance.
all set to the rhythm of the hot Latin sound.
everything under control.
you got everything all under control, right?
you're in control. Everybody here knows that.
anything to survive. You're a reaI american paranoid.
everything is there for you to see.
have written it.
all bets were off once you showed him the tape.
everything is working within you and through you.
all of it survellled by security cameras within the building.
everything is being done to prevent any sort of security breach,
everything was coming unglued.
everything is moving.
it's happening, ray. It's war.
everything keeps changing.
everything changes, everything's the same.
I mean, it's changing, but you've got to learn to change with it.
everything keeps changing. All right, come on, we're ripping it down.
chchchch... Changes turn and face the strain
chchchch... Changes, just have to be an older man.
everything's about to change, people!
everything's been turning bad, one disaster after another.
things are looking up.

here at the end of all things.

and romantically fixated from nothing more than one fleeting glance.
it's all burning.
all in the name of love.
everything was... Physically appealing,
everything grows wild, Cole.
it... It all happened really fast.
everything is waiting
everything's waiting for you
everything keeps going. Nature of life.
all overseen by the United States of America.
everything is on the table.
it's like a test. The whole thing is like one big test.
just what you have in your head, right?
all will be swell, soon as mother's refreshed.
things continue to reveal themselves.
it's right out of a gossamer book. don't talk. Listen.
everything stops the day before the funeral,
everything here is within operational parameters.
down in position.
something is destroying everything.
everything just fell apart.
the police have it under control.
everything is going to schedule.
all went down as planned.
all part of the plan, yes?
all part of my plan.
all part of the plan, master.
all part of the plan, yes? Exactly.
it's on the way, bro.
to the point of certainty.
it's all on track.
well, this just keeps getting better
everything is jumping.
everything's dancing.
everything keeps going around in a circle to the same dark end.
it's going to be okay. We're going to be fine.
everything's just turning and turning about until you just fall to the ground.
it's all here, everything.
it ends here. For you and the police, maybe.
everything's here, just as you left it.
it's everything.
just to wind up here, today, without her,
everything is explained here.
it ends here!
here at the end of all things.
that it ends here, in a health food restaurant on sunset Boulevard.
all you do is get in the way.
everything is in motion. Can we count on you?
this'll work.
it worked every time.
everything happened to be there.
no, where it all begins, Mr. Pire.
where everything dissolves,
and everything is possible, again.
everything is on that.
it shows everything.
it's all in there.
everything that blocks our path to what we desire.
it's all in the crust.
there's no shocker there. Well, I'm not done.
entirely according to plan.
things were changing quickly.
everything falIs in.
everything is based on his work.
everything was pretty much over.
I've laid all the groundwork, and tomorrow,
which puts everything in danger, everything!
nothing's getting done until your way out of this becomes clear.
everything taken care of?
everything's taken care of, but l'm reluctant to talk on the phone.
everything's been handled. We're clear to go.
it's all been taken care of.
you did everything right.
do we have everything we need... Let's see.
this complicates everything.
it's all wrong. It wasn't supposed to be like this.
all was right with the world.
everything's so different.
everything fits together perfectly
it's just so unfair.
this isn't even right.
it's not really real, is it? Do you know what I mean?
it's just so goddamn bright, isn't it?
thinking it was just all very shocking.
everything was on the line.
the whole thing is ridiculous.
it's too complicated.
it's just so complicated and confusing.
everything's too big. Yeah, it's too big.
this whole business is insane! You know me.
time's gone all weird... That's it. I'm outta here.
everything's great.
everything is fabulous.
everything worked out so perfectly.
it's just all too smooth to be true.
all too well, it was our plan.
all is so perfectly, damnably well!
it was way too easy, way too convenient.
it was just - it was too weird.
everything's moving kinda fast.
it's just - it's too much too soon.
it just happened so fast, and then I saw this thing coming at me, like - like a monster.
it just goes so fast, you know?
all this is too strange.
it was all too horrible. I had to avert my eyes.
it's all moot.
it's all a little too neat.
it's too early for all that.
but it cann't be helped.
it was too late, and.
it's a little late now, isn't it?
it's too late, Jamal. Now go.
everything is super good.
it's amazing, because you go through so many different things.
it's all so unresolved?
it's just all kinds of messed up.
it was may hem, general chaos.
it's all too clear. Obvious.
all this is damn exciting.
does that make it any less real?
it was all very fascinating.
this is all very strange.
that things are moving too fast.
the circumstances have changed suddenly,
it all happened fast.
all of a sudden, there's a corpse outside? Bad idea.
it's all very neat and easy.
it was all too easy.
everything is collapsing, it's very sad.
it's all been awful.
and that's just fine.
is just fantastic!
it could not have happened better.
everything's vulnerable. Everything.
it's all too neat, too easy.
it's almost too good to be true
and it was too late.
it's too late for me too. David. It's too late.
I'm going to go find the queen.
it's too late. I've already read more than one book. All right, come on.
everything's so new
everything's been so hard.
it had all been too easy.
and it all spiraled out of control
everything is just spinning out of control,
everything's got out of control.
will have been for nothing.
everything seemed meaningless,
everything was out of control. I Didn't know what the hell to do.
all hell broke loose, and when the blood boils.
and everything is going out of control.
and they've gone wrong!
everything was out of control
things have gotten so out of hand. I broke my first bundle cake.
it's out of control, and it's my fault.
the whole thing was a complete failure.

everything is arranged. The ark is on board.
it's alright, Petey, it's alright.
everything was planned, bought and paid for.
it's all set. Thank you.
I'll call in as soon as I know everything's okay.
everything's secure and everyone's accounted for?
it's been entirely... Uneventful.
everything's all right, yes, everything
all saddled in and happy, are we then, sir?
all is calm
things are gonna quiet down. It's gonna get easier.
when things settle down, can you contact Kim for me?
all of this would fall apart.
and total ruin.
everything ended!
everything is destroyed! Everything!
it's all over. They've heard it all, Burke.
everything is ruined. You made me kill someone I cared about over nothing.
it's over! Get out!
it is finished?
it's all over. Fuck's sake!
it's gonna be all right, Nan. Just close your eyes.
forget it. Just... Mom.

I'm screwed. The deal is tomorrow.

everything's screwed up, dad.
everything would come apart.
it's over, Gail. There's no fighting them
that's finished. It's over. It's finished with. Over.
Oh, it's over, daddy. Hey.
it's over, dodge. It's time to pack it up and go home.
anything that is physically possible actually does occur.
and everything seemed perfectly normal.
everything's exactly the same, except for the bird.
but I would've done anything.
well, everything come off all right? Tell me.
when everything is ended, then you come.
all is perfect.
and everything is perfect,
everything was going perfectly.
everything's perfect.
everything ended up fine.
and everything, all hell broke loose.
it's all over.
everything is finalized. So - so when do we meet the mother?
actually, everything checks out in there.
everything was much easier.
you were right about everything.
it fits, doesn't it?
nothing is insignificant.
everything that is at all good in me,
he's got an answer for everything.
everything's going to be different, and I'm so scared.
would be long - buried in the past.
it's all and it is turn off.
everything's falling apart, the crisis and all,
all that was for nothing.
and nothing will ever be the same.
things are going to be different.
everything's about to turn to crap.
and everything shall be as it was
it will be completely different in just 40 years time.
it all ends tonight.
it's all come down to this.
this is all that would be left of us.
nothing will make sense
and it'll be business as usual, okay?
it is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant.
nothing will return to normal.
and it will be back to business as usual.
he won't be able to do any of them.
everything has been pointing me towards something good.
everything's coming together right on schedule.
everything is gonna change.
everything is about to change for you.
everything will be different.
everything will be very nice
the resuIt could be anarchy.
this is where we're going to start again.
events are closing.
it all ends here. Tonight.
everything will go on as it is,
nothing would survive. Not even bacteria.
it's going to burn and you
it's all gonna burn, and you're gonna be nothing but bleached skulls.
an airing will do me a great deal of good, I'm sure.
it'd be just like old times.
all due respect to you,
it's wrapped up with a bow on top.
everything Was set.
it's all falling into place.
everything is set, exhausted, the point made, perfect
everything set up, gentlemen? Just about.
the table's been set: let's get to the main course.
I'd pretty much seen and done everything.
I'm the one with all the lines.
exactly as it should be.
everything belongs to me.
everything was on the line. If she turned you in, your life would be ruined.
I mean, everything is just falling apart.
everything's down. Which means what?
then it all went wrong.
the stage is set.
ready to go. Yeah, lieutenant.
two hours of surgency
for the lines of convergence are being drawn across the earth, even now.
we're on top of this,
it is too late.
that it's much too late
but this is all be a long time coming.
everything's ready. He knows the metro like the back of his hand.
you know, everything is working.
attendance is up, giving is up, we've got the best music in town.
it won't make any difference, Helen.
I'm all set.
could take no hold upon him.
money is about the bottom line.
everything is changing
not what it used to be
look, things have changed.
and it's all revelation
it's all so clear now.
that it had already been written.
everything is going as planned.
that it's over, sir.
now everything is settled.
all is ready, let's go
we are locked in loading here, right?
everything just happens, right?
and that should be enough.
it's already too late
it was already too late.
it's all been taken care of. Oh?
everything's arranged. Good, good, good.
everything is done and everything is absolutely flawless.
everything is positioning nicely.
it's all starting to happen.
things have changed.
nothing's the same around here anyway. Nothing's the way it used to be!
everything's known, everything's determined.
and this whoIe thing is over.
that was just over. She was hiding.
everyone has the feeling it's all be done before.
they're scripted very tightly.
it's all planned to work out.
all that's confirmed.
now that time has gone by.
she made everything beautiful.
all clean and when the gertrudes come home,
and they's just fine.
Evertyhing's fine. It's not. He's setting us up.
everything is peaceful.
you know, relationships are easy when everything runs nice and smooth.
and it was all rainbows and unicorns.
that should not change.
everything had to be perfect.
everything should be fine.
yet all shall be forgot.
things have to be perfect.
it's all kicking off now.
it all started in the new York public library.
things are really starting to take shape, and I'm blossoming! Really, I am!
that's when it all started happening.
after her big break. Where's LAN? lan!
after her big break. Where's LAN? LAN!
it's all starting to come true.
everything started shaking.
everything started spinning, and then I was just standing there,
everything blurred, head or tails
everything has started to click.
wheels are in motion.
things were just starting to come together.
nothing makes any sense any more.
I mean, everything turns upside down.
it was all taken care of.
it's all clear. False alarm.
all of which leads to the most frightening question of all.
Joe gets everything and you don't.
everything's back in place.
Everytng's the way it's supposed to be.
anything, you got it.
all to you.
all started 'cause you jumped off a building.
it will be because of her.
and we owe it all to me!
well, all credit goes to this lady on my left.
and that's what it all comes down to.
that's what started all of this. But then I realized,
I'm taking everything
it all comes down to this challenging night of competition.
and everything gets cleaned away.
it all got turned upside down, Didn't it?
everything pointed at the opposite.
and everything is just... Perfect.
it's getting weird in here.
none of this seems right. I mean, who are you?
it's all great.
everything looks good and keep your eyes.
things are going great.
everything is not in order
about everything that's going wrong,
and they are very ritualistic
it was all worth it, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
everything... Very pageanty.
everything was fake, disingenuous.
all fair and square.
and this is all so weird.
everything was so rushed.
it's just - it's been a whirlwind.
all in due time. Lovely. Yes. Blow.
it all makes sense.
it all sounds very reasonable, doesn't it?
and, you know, everything just kind of lines up, it's really magical.
it's all pretty weird.
all is good.

all things gone okay. Yes?
everything was perfect and then suddenly, it just all went wrong?
everything's perfect. The men are a total disaster.
all perfect, without slips. As I like it
it was perfect, except for one thing.
flying around, everything is so small, everything goes by so fast.
everything neat. Clean.
it was nothing unusual.
and everything is white and calm.
things stay quiet, I'd be up for anything.
everything's quiet, Charlie.
everything seemed cool until their leader came back
leaving everything in the open? That's right!
it's perfectly legit.

everything was really bright.
like it all makes sense.
it's all such fun.
everything's funny.
it was all kind of, uh... Kind of hazy.
everything's wonderful.
Yeah, everything looks wonderful. doesn't everything look wonderful?
everything's so nice. Thanks.
everything seems to be a blur.
it's all a blur,
and all is right with the world.
everything's calm here, right?
nothing's going crazy or nothing.
no more than usual. Yeah. No, I hear that.
it was normal. You know? Nothing freaky.
this is totally normal not a problem here this is just a monster with me
this is totally normal, not a problem here. This is just a monster with me.
everything was fine until Lizzie got detention.
that is right up until she walked inon her girlfriend in flagrante with one of her North koreanbusiness partners.
everything is in the green. I mean, it's working great.
nothing, except for the hives.
instead of it flowing through the arm, it just stops dead and hangs down there like that.
the Humvee got messed up bad.
it's been a crazy time, at home with Sarah and all.
and it was really just a mess.
everything's clear.
it's all clear,
so it was pretty clear that
so, now you know everything.
so we're clear, I have a boyfriend.
satisfied. Then you walk in.
everything is erotic. Girls.
everything was familiar.
it's all very modern the media is safe and many believe it's wise to be silent
there is nothing I don't cherish!
uh, and everything about it, the way you played the two different characters.
like everything is finally real.
it was very sudden.
well, it all happened so fast.
all very simple.
everything's simple. I mean, you don't play games.
and said was too elaborate, but that's what he did.
it all sucks.
I hated everything.
so it was always very tight.
everything's moving slowly but happening so quickly, too.
everything's beautiful.
it's beautiful and so are you
everything was delicious.
and everything was Amazing.
everything is good
everybody should share equally.
it was a joyous occasion until.
it's all fun and games until the judges start giving scores.
it was wonderful.
everything's pretty old.
everything's vulnerable. Everything.
you like Lili and she likes you.
it's all natural, and we have spoken about that dress.
things are tough all over.
that was very hard, and right now we're still trying to recover.
it all seems so crazy.
it was all superficial. Completely about sex.
everything was just... Mad.
nothing made sense.
everything looks excellent.
everything's incredibIe, ma. I just wanted to tell you I Iove you.
everything's incredible, ma. I just wanted to tell you I love you.
Yeah, everything's great. good.

what happens matters.
it's very... Foreign.
all in good time, son.
and everything seem to proceed for the best
and, you know, everything was going great,
everything was fine.
all is well. Everything is in the hands of your most devoted.
is everything OK?
and with them always and all was right and proper.
it was going well. They worked at Madame Arthur.
it was like clockwork. They're real pros, man.
did okay. They're happy.
everything is going really good, you know?
and everything was on time, except for you.
all well and good, but what do we know about fashion?
well, that went well, I think.
I thought the whole thing went pretty well, yeah?
things are going well,
and it works' cause I trust you and I know you want what's best for us.
everything is gonna be just fine, if that's what you mean.
that was great, right?
everything is great as it is.
everything worked. It's in the bag.
this all goes well, we might have a future together.
things went so well, we took an after - dinner stroll.
everything was going good, and then.
everything's perfect; more than enough time.
so, uh, just ride out the trip, okay?
everything is fine. Just a few last - minute touch - ups.
everything was going great until three nights ago.
everything good till they locked my ass away.
everything go all right, buddy?
anything goes, and the auditions rocked.
now it is all working. Get it together.
everything to hand - developing dishes here, toning bath here, whole - plate enlarger.
it's just, sometimes when things are going really good for me,
it's a lost cause.
we need to do things strictly by the book.
it all started because I went to see her
but, so......This is new.
you must pay for everything: the toilet, custody, and it's 350 pesos per each.
all must end in blood.
must all end in blood?
you have to earn what you get.
everything happens with the flick of a switch.
it all has to happen exactly like it happened.
it's got to be snuff.
and it's all thanks to the existence of this fragile staircase.
it's about you taking control.
everything needs to be destroyed.
until we prove ourselves, it's hard to be like, "trust me,"
run everything by me.
everything runs through me, no exceptions, and I get full credit.
we had to start all over.
and wanna a brand new start
it will all have to be redone. All of it.
so much depends on you.
it was always up to you.
pounding the pavement is not a luxury that I get.
everything must be done in the most expeditious manner.
everything's gotta be perfect.
things have to hold up.
everything must be exactly how I've envisioned.
everything must be exactly how I envisioned it.
everything must go
could all be combined.
it was very quick, guy. She wasn't hurt in any way.
everything was flaming out of control.
we're almost to the end, folks.
everything is so now with end.
it felt really sexy.
it was him. The false prophet. He killed you.
fuck you for happening.
you'll be blaming us. Get the door.
blames me for everything.
I blamed her for everything.
everything was back to normal.
that's all back to the way it belongs as well.
Yeah. So everything's... Everything's okay.
it's good to have everything back.
everything went back to normal.
everything's back in order.
everything seems to be right on track.
everything will be right back where it was. Right, sweet buddy?
the world's back to normal, that's all. No, it isn't.
everything came back fine. You're good to go.
and everything should return to normal.
when everything is... Right in the world?
everything so exact, down to the smallest detail, you know?
everything is on the line.
everything's leveraged to the hilt. That means no credit cards, no cash, nada.
it's so up in the air.
had it all worked out.
nothing feels... Solid.
the way that they slow everything down,
everything was late, and those guys just don't want to work.
things are heating up.
everythings slowly starting to wither away.
it was over.
it all became my fault,
things seem a little up in the air, and you're wondering how you fit in.
into reality.
it's all happening, you know?
it's a beginning, not an end.
everything is packed and ready.
all in the name of a good story or compelling television.
good riddance, goodbye.
all signs point to hot hybrid vampire sex.
everything points to Iran. we should keep looking.
it all pointed to this man
everything points to your submarine being detected.
everything pointed to some kind ofobstruction or distress.
everything supports that he was here for the bombing. There was a time discrepancy.
everything led to here! Hah!
all right, everything points to home invasion.
it all points to the perfume
it'll be just like we planned.
everything is going according to my plan.
everything's on course.
everything's been cleared out like a stage.
things are organized following a model, a scheme, a logical series.
everything you planned is coming to pass.
standard formation to start, but if there's a baby on board,
all through the advice of fortune - tellers.
is everything going to plan?
everything's going right ahead on schedule, anyway.
it was all going according to plan.
everything's going according to plan. All we need is the girl.
reformed exactly as planned.
so everything's gone to plan?
everything is proceeding as planned.
and that everything is running on schedule.
everything went exactly according to plan, Hendricks.
everything according to plan. Right you are, Mr Deane.
is everything on schedule?
nature's taking its course. We can just relax.
everything went according to plan until we made for the exit rendezvous.
everything is proceeding as planned. Mobilize the ops.
everything is in order. All except one thing.
and do everything according to post office regulations.
it's like clockwork.
everything is goingaccording to plan.
everything's going to plan, and then one day, outta nowhere,
everything stands in my way.
everyth - everything's fine.
everything go okay?
we were doing fine.
everything good? Yes, good.
everything was perfect. Thank you.
everything's so pink.
you know, everything was cool, and then today you're acting kinda weird.
it's all working out so good, right?
everything just turned to color.
and everything depends on how you vote.
it's all in the hands of God.
all in the hands of the Indian government.
it is in our hands.
everything's under control.
everything's worked out in advance.
everything's all set.
things are good?
everything's OK, you give us a sign.
everything's OK.
we got things all cleaned up around here?
everything worked out. Sure did.
it is over, father. We've done it.
everything clearly - plants - you want plants?
when this is all done, I promise,
everything's okay! But it won't be okay.
and there we go. And that will hold my main meal pot very nicely.
everything's ruined.
had gone all wrong or been trampled on
and screw up so badly it affects your whole life?
everything's messed up. Remember? I came to your house
that came out all wrong.
everything fell apart.
everything's just fallen apart.
nothing holds together, nothing makes a better sense now.
and no one and nothing can change that.
and everything changed.
and it changed everthing
and nothing can ever be the same again.
everything changed,
everything has changed -
that changes everything, doesn't it?
you know, things have changed. You've changed me.
this blows up completely, becomes infinite.
things changed when we kissed.
everything I say to myself is changed.
and it changed everything - my soul, my consciousness,
everything changed. And then... You.
it changes everything. The contest is a few days away.
and everything's changed, except you, 'cause you're stiII here.
it's all changed so much.
everything's all broken.
everything's in precise order.
things slow down.
everything's - hey, relax, okay?
everything's falling apart. No order anymore.
everything's falling apart. Luckily, the guys.
everything arranged coldly on shelves is what I thought.
is it all ready? Right!
in the peacefulness and regularity of things.
everything was untraceable, including the truck.
it doesn't matter.
nothing matters anymore!
well, it's okay.
it all seemed rather pointless.
everything is here for you.
not going to replace you.
it's too overwhelming. My dear, what you need is a relationship.
it's not going to work out.
everything feels out of control.
if you're not in the same room.
nothing can escape it, even light,
that this was going to happen
progress, regress each step's a climb so I take that test and testify
you never know what's around the corner, do you?
this would be all useless.
and everything's clear now.
so the stars just kind of lined up.
all is bright
that explains everything.
and that's all over with.
that's all it takes is a touch.
one day everything's a lie, you wanna drive?
it's all gone wrong.
it's all a crazy game
all it took was once.
everything is a habit.
everything happens for a reason. I like that.
in heaven all things will be arranged.
all is in God's hands.
it's God's will.
there but for the grace of God.
everything is God's doing!
everything unchanging, perpetual.
it's all unforgivable.
all things are not knowable
none of it was real.
and it was just instinctual.
it's all been given to you - and you feel guilty about it!
everything was always professional. Completely professional.
everything does - everything good.
it's all just a big misunderstanding.
it's all lies, I swear to you.
all just a dream,
it's all mumbo - jumbo. He's just a filthy man.
everything is a joke.
was a joke, but, you know, they really ate it up,
is everything else a lie?
it's a road map.
this was all a mistake.
it was a mistake. I shouldn't have gone.
