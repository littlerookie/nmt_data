well, he's not counting. Not off the top of a five-deck shoe.
wait a minute.
isn't that that two-bit magic act over at the Back Page?
what's his name? - Cadillac.
Yeah, that's Frank Cadillac.
is he pulling tricks on us? Is that legal?
you can't trick the deck.
I'm telling you, that little prick knows what's coming.
if he's running that good a system, why is he not betting more?
that's going to be my second question.
look at that. He's looking right at us.
it's like he can hear us.
what table was that? - 27.
this is Roybal. Give me two men on table 27. I'm coming right down.
place your bets, please.
here's the thing about the future.
every time you look at it, it changes because you looked at it.
Hi. - And that changes everything else.
9070
empty the drawer. Move!
drop the gun! Now!
9070
drop the gun! Step back!
it's his gun. He was going to shoot two people!
step back. We'll settle this right now.
what's he doing?
secure the doors, elevators, escalators, every way out of this damn place! Now!
freeman, seal off the blackjack tables. Sullivan, link up with Roybal.
we're on the floor. On the floor right now.
bring up the other cameras.
that way. This way.
he's right next to you. $10 slots, aisle 14.
there he is! Behind you! Your left! Turn around!
he's right between you!
he's in the mens room near the gift shop. Gift shop! Gift shop!
Davis, where the hell is he?
black T-shirt, straw hat! Heading towards the entrance!
come on, let's go.
call Vegas P. D.
just stole a silver Charger, tag 585G4S.
drop the gun! Step back.
he rose to the top of our gambling fraud wish list about two months ago.
what he does has nothing to do with luck. It's definable ability.
look at him. He knows exactly what to do and not be caught.
can you explain that to me?
no, I can't explain it, Callie, nor do I have the time.
the Russian Federation has a 10-kiloton nuclear munition - unaccounted for. - I understand that.
I'm not sure you do. We need every agent available beating the street.
that bomb was stolen five weeks ago. We've just been informed of it now.
which means it could be parked under this truck for all we know.
I need actionable intelligence, not paranormals and bullshit magicians.
with all due respect, sir, this bullshit magiciars shown a pattern of advanced awareness that is statistically impossible.
you let me bring him in and you'll get what you want.
five days, Callie. That's it.
get me the head of casino security.
you Roybal? - It's Roybal.
whatever.
who are you? - Cavanaugh. Take a walk.
Hey, Roybal, this isn't a pissing contest. Come on.
What'd you do? You got a new car? - Stole it.
look at this.
twenty minutes to walk 20 steps.
well, that's what you get from two packs a day.
Oh, hey.
I got you two sandwiches. - Two sandwiches?
that's 20 grand. - Take it. I love you.
Oh, jeez.
how can I repay you?
must be a bitch to park this thing.
chief Roybal. Special Agent Ferris.
I'm sure Agent Cavanaugh has explained to you that everything you say is admissible in court and anything you knowingly admit can be used against you.
do we understand each other?
sure.
tell me about Cris Johnson. - I don't know who that is.
how about Frank Cadillac?
you chased him out of your casino tonight.
he stole a car from valet parking. - Yeah, I know Cadillac.
I thought he was cheating us at cards.
next thing I know, he's tackling some guy and waving a gun.
the gun wasn't his.
the man he tackled is wanted for two casino killings in Reno.
he's in custody now.
come on, I want to show you something.
you remember this?
Oh, yeah, of course I do. We were saying he's looking right at us.
how'd you get this? - Think carefully.
what were you talking about right when he looked up?
we were saying, if he has a system, why isn't he betting more?
you sure you weren't doing or saying anything else?
I was going down to pick him up, I was reaching for my radio...
and right then? That's when he looked up? Be very specific.
that's what I said.
he looked up, really.
so he doesn't have to be there to do it.
once you enter his consciousness, he can pick it up.
is that to work his system?
thank you. We're finished.
done some good here, Mr. Roybal, but none of it is up for discussion.
now, as far as you're concerned, Cris Johnson never existed.
that's going to be difficult considering 100 cameras saw him at the casino.
not to worry. Those tapes have been destroyed.
Hey. Is she single?
cris, you can't keep stealing cars and having people chase you.
that's not a life.
but you got to forget this girl that you keep seeing in your head.
I'm not going anywhere until I meet her.
well, suppose she don't show up?
she already did, at the diner. 8: 09.
well, you got a couple hours. How about a game of pool?
all right, Irv.
we'll shoot some pool.
we timed every hand of blackjack.
the longest was 89 seconds, when Johnson pulled a six-card 21.
so we know he can see at least a minute and a half ahead.
I had our techs run a radio frequency spectrum analysis.
came up dry, so he's not receiving any form of electronic help.
at one point, there was a two-minute, 16-second delay.
he never bet, just got up and walked away.
well, maybe 2: 16's too long. He can't see that far.
narrows our window a little bit, anyway.
got him. Vegas P. D. Got a LoJack hit on the stolen vehicle.
okay.
listen, about that girl.
when you looked at the clock, did you happen to see a calendar?
because it could be 10 years from now she gets hungry.
it's got to be soon.
I've never seen further ahead than two minutes.
except for her.
now, what do you think the reason is for that?
I don't know. Maybe she doesn't scare easy.
maybe she's the one.
well, when you get like this there's no talking to you.
she's almost here.
what happened to the diner?
somebody else, a cop. - A cop? Well, then, you got to go.
hold on. I want to see how much she knows. What she wants from me.
where else would I be?
special Agent Ferris.
next time, steal a car without LoJack.
can we speak privately?
it's okay, Irv.
go ahead. Thanks.
I'm sure you know why I'm here.
because you're the man who knows what I'm going to do before I do it, right?
Oh, the show, right. Right!
I saw you there.
wonderful. You like magic tricks.
Yeah, yeah, I do like your magic tricks, clairvoyance...
whatever you're calling it.
let's talk about something hard.
a stolen nuclear munition is being smuggled into the United States, or may, in fact, already be here.
I want you to look ahead and tell me where it's going to be deployed.
I think you've got the wrong guy. It's a magic act.
you going to stick with that story?
because millions of lives are at risk and you could, maybe, prevent a major catastrophe.
on a practical note, we're standing in front of a stolen vehicle and you are wanted for assault involving a weapon at the casino.
all right, that was an accident. He had a gun.
he was going to shoot two people. - Yeah?
how'd you know that?
no good deed goes unpunished, does it?
I can fix your legal problems, buddy, but you've got to step up.
otherwise, your next magic show is going to be at Folsom State Prison.
it's ironic, but people like you who try to help have been torturing me, in the full sense of the word, since I was three years old.
what did they call it?
Oh, yeah.
observed play therapy.
featuring the marathon, 36-hour, can-you-guess-the-next-flash-card game.
so, please, leave me alone and let me live some semblance of a normal life.
I'd love to indulge your feelings, but I am dealing with a slightly larger picture right now.
now, you can exercise your responsibility to help your fellow man or I will exercise that responsibility for you.
you're right. I got to go.
he's gone, right?
I missed him by seconds, didn't I?
excuse me, honey, can you get off my car?
Yeah, thank you. Jeez.
Mr. Roybal? - It's Roybal. Can I help you, man?
I have a few questions if this is a good time.
gaming Commission? It's after hours.
you guys should be at a strip club, right? Come on.
what can you tell us about Cris Johnson?
I don't know who you're talking about.
let me rephrase the question.
it's destiny.
here you go, hon. - Thanks.
excuse me.
hello.
I noticed you were alone, too. Do you mind if I join you?
actually, I do.
sorry to bother you, but I have a question about the coffee.
the bean they use...
isn't that something you should probably ask your waitress?
Yes, it is.
excuse me, do you have a light?
I don't smoke.
here you go, hon. - Thanks.
please.
don't.
Hey, Liz.
did you follow me here, Kendall?
No! No, I just thought we could talk.
you know, we got really nothing to talk about.
and I told you that three weeks ago.
Liz, come on, all right? I had an off day. Just give me another shot.
it's not gonna happen. Okay? So maybe you should just go.
do you know how hard it was to find you?
I was at your apartment. I tried the Starbucks on Lexington.
I was at the dry cleaner. All I am asking for is a few minutes of your time so that we can work things out.
okay, Jesus, you are stalking me now. - Don't!
don't say that, please. That's a terrible thing to say to somebody.
let go of me, Kendall.
look, I just... I thought we could talk, maybe we could take a drive.
and now you are ruining it.
you're hurting me.
Kendall, I think you're having another off day.
who the hell are you? - I'm her future.
Really?
Hi, my name's Cris.
you okay, Kendall?
see, the thing is, I feel connected to you. I don't know the reason why.
see, now, listen. - All right.
I think it's only fair that you pay for the lady's breakfast.
what are you having? Pecan pie is amazing.
excuse me, I can pay for my own breakfast.
and you know what?
you two work things out.
okay.
you're hurting me.
Kendall, I think you're having another off day.
who the hell are you? - I'm her future.
Really?
incoming.
did you see that?
goddamn it! Kendall!
what? Don't blame me. This is your fault.
get out of here! Will somebody please call the cops?
are you okay? Let me help you.
come on, let's get you cleaned up.
come on.
okay.
Oh, yeah, I'm seeing some stars.
Yeah.
I'm Liz.
cris.
you must have a death wish getting involved in that.
here. Just...
okay. - Just...
okay, hold it there for a little bit.
okay. - Yeah.
it will.
what will? - Your luck. It's going to change.
what are you? A leprechaun?
do leprechauns get punched in the face or have their car stolen?
your car was stolen?
Yeah. I'm hoping they find it today.
I'm supposed to be in Flagstaff.
Hey, is this tooth loose here?
I don't know. I don't think so.
hurts.
well, listen, maybe I could give you a ride, and I'm kind of going that way.
that would really be helpful, Liz. Thank you.
well, I do have to make a stop, though.
it's okay.
and it might take a few hours, so if you're cool with that.
Hey, look, if you're uncomfortable with this, - I'll take the bus. - No, no, no.
it's fine, it's fine. You're not a psycho.
right?
because the first psycho vibe I get, you're out of the car.
okay. Yes, ma'am. - Okay.
deal.
deal.
it's amazing, isn't it?
I end up in a diner where you are, and we're both headed in the same direction.
I don't know if I would call it amazing, but...
destiny.
that's what it really is.
okay, I'm starting to get that psycho vibe.
Oh no. You don't believe in destiny?
well, even if it does exist,
I don't think I want to know.
I mean, if every move we make is preordained, then what is the point of that?
I mean, life is supposed to be a surprise.
isn't it?
it would be nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
so he came in twice a day for a week at exactly 8: 09?
Yeah, he'd stay a few minutes, have a martini, and then he'd go.
till today, when he met that lady.
you didn't find anything strange about that?
not strange enough to call the police.
we got a regular that counts the corn flakes in his bowl because it has to be an even number.
got any cameras?
inside? No.
outside?
no.
did you notice what kind of car he was driving?
maybe overhear where they were going?
I don't know what car, but they were headed up to Flagstaff.
Flagstaff. - That's what they said.
got another regular, she's always on a diet.
brings in a scale and her own salad dressing.
thank you. - You're welcome.
guy knows we're after him, but he still risks coming here.
8: 09, twice a day. - Doesrt even know if it's day or night.
just the time. He was waiting for her.
all right, there's a traffic cam over there, a bank, a 7-Eleven across the street.
just run all the tapes. Maybe we'll get lucky and catch him in wide.
your buddy Roybal, the casino chief?
had his throat cut last night after getting a kneecap shot off.
you're telling me this now? We just talked to him about Johnson.
Hey, I just found out. - All right.
local weapon? - Dead end.
and forensics came up empty. Not a hair, not a fiber.
somebody wants information.
now, the next time anything happens relative to Johnson,
I want to know right away.
I don't care if it's a paper cut.
okay, boss.
that's good! Good. Right there!
the head of casino security, what did you learn from him?
for a macho guy, he screams like a girl.
but he was questioned by federal agents looking for Cris Johnson, yes?
he said they haven't found him yet.
do you believe this shit?
he can see things before they happen?
it makes no difference what I believe.
look, we spent two years setting this up and that man out there is worried all this will be compromised by Johnson.
we're wasting our time looking for some magician.
we're being paid to secure the operation, Jones, not to hunt down some carnival barker.
Really? Then why are the same authorities that are looking for us so interested in him?
get rid of him.
do it now.
Hey.
Havasupai Reservation. I teach here once a week.
the conditions are pretty lousy.
but it's in the Canyon, one of the Eight Wonders of the World.
Hey, Sam. - Hey, Liz.
well, a couple hundred years ago, this tribe was booming.
plenty of food and a thriving culture. They should be better off.
but I guess this was just their destiny.
I'd like to meet their shaman.
I read once that in many North American tribes their shamars purpose wasrt only healing but they also claimed to have power over the atmosphere.
to bring on or stop rain.
even know future events.
do you think that's possible?
do you think that's possible?
well, I believe anything is possible.
me, too.
whose birthday? - One of my students'.
Hey! Hi!
how's it going?
Hello! How is everybody? Good?
that's good. - Oh, I was close.
that was a lot. You messed up on the last part.
on the last part. Yeah.
I thought you werert coming back until next Monday.
well, I'm not, but it's Jake's birthday. How could I miss that?
who's that man you're with?
is he your boyfriend?
no, no, he's not my boyfriend. He's just my friend.
I think he likes you.
well, why would you say that?
because he looked at you like my brother looks at his girlfriend.
Hey, Jake, you want to see some magic?
I'll show you something. Come here.
I found this rock out in the Canyon and I want you to hold it because it's a magic rock.
that's right. Hold it really tight. Keep squeezing.
it's magic.
he won't bite.
happy birthday.
so, you're a magician?
well...
I have a small magic act back in Vegas.
the Frank Cadillac Show.
I thought your name was Cris. - It is.
Frank Cadillac is my stage name.
how did you come up with that?
I picked two things I really liked and I put them together.
Frankenstein and Cadillacs.
you are odd.
charming, but odd.
cease fire! Visitor on the range!
nice.
a little close, though.
okay.
you were right about the traffic cam. We got a positive ID.
I'm sorry.
don't be.
it's okay.
did I drool?
drool? - Yeah.
drool? No.
Oh, my God, it's coming down so hard.
Yeah.
I like rain.
I like rain, too.
you know, once, I think it was in Denmark, it rained fish.
because the sun dehydrated the water and took it up into the atmosphere, rehydrated the fish eggs and they hatched and it rained fish.
is that true?
Yeah, in the clouds. True story. It happened 50 years ago.
I just felt like sharing that with you.
road's washed out ahead. You can't cross till morning.
not even then if this keeps up.
you want to spin around and go back about two miles, take your second left. There'll be a motel there called...
the Cliffhanger." Thanks.
right.
him, right?
that's it?
there's no front plate. Where's the other side?
I don't have it.
what was that on the front window? Go back.
back, back.
back. There! Zoom in.
that's a permit.
track it and find her.
I'll light a fire.
cris, one little problem.
Oh, no, no, I'm going to sleep in the car.
okay.
here.
Thanks. - Sure.
Hey, did you hear the joke about the Zen master who ordered the hot dog?
no.
he said he'd have one with everything.
good night.
good night.
what do we have?
they're at the Cliffhanger Motel outside Flagstaff.
we found an Arizona DOT foreman who remembered the Land Cruiser.
why would he do that?
the road was flooded. He was about to suggest a place to stay.
but Johnson already knew. Right?
exactly.
Callie. It just got worse.
all right, people, we've got a nuclear alert.
code Red, in the Southern California region. L. A. To San Diego.
95% certainty.
nuclear emergency search teams are on the way, but until they get here, can somebody please tell me what my agency, the FBI, is doing about it?
sir, tier-one suspects have been interrogated.
cars and premises have been checked, friends and acquaintances.
we've opened up surveillance on tier-two and three suspects, but nothing actionable yet.
Oh, is that what we're doing, waiting for something actionable?
there are eight million lives that are precarious at best.
I say we widen the net to "slightly suspicious
and get some decent intel before this nuke blows up Los Angeles.
all right, Callie.
what do you propose we do next?
I believe that the urgency of this situation compels the use of any and all resources to obtain Cris Johnson.
we know where he is. Let my team pick him up.
he said they're mobilizing.
standard procedure when security is escalated.
tell him to wrap it up.
they'll lead us straight to Johnson.
you hungry? There's a coffee shop down the road.
I'd rather eat here, if that's okay.
sure.
what?
there's an Italian painter named Carlotti, and he defined beauty.
he said it was the summation of the parts working together in such a way that nothing needed to be added, taken away or altered.
that's you.
you're beautiful.
Wow.
that was incredible.
what was?
this.
right here gives us a good standoff position and open view of the front of the motel.
we can run multiple point and area surveillances from this road here, that turn out.
get a team with a parabolic set right here.
that's fine, but I also want mobile surveillance.
and give me two or three roamers.
if he rabbits on us, I want to be flexible.
Ferris.
call the local police in Flagstaff.
tell them to hold the outside perimeter.
I want that area locked down.
a body turned up in an apartment with a line of sight to my office.
slit throat, like Roybal.
somebody's trying to follow us to Johnson.
cris.
Yeah.
maybe there is such a thing as destiny.
give it 40 seconds.
so, after two minutes, he just stops seeing what's going to happen?
I sure as hell hope so.
Elizabeth Cooper?
Yeah. - Federal Agent Ferris.
what is this about?
I'm going to need a few minutes of your time.
Yeah, okay.
they're putting her in the car.
drop the gun! Step back.
it's his gun. He was going to shoot two people!
OK, everybody. Ready?
let's settle down.
today I'm going to show you a story.
let's all tune in together.
a long time ago...
...the soul of our planet was sick.
people had become isolated...
...and warlike.
our world was frightened.
it was dying.
but a great scientist...
...was trying to save us.
he had tried many times...
...and he knew he could only try once more.
this was the last Mimzy.
it's gotta be my new braces.
I'm not a terrorist, ok?
Ah, you sure about that? Let's see in your pockets.
that's the third time she's done that.
we're gonna be late for the test.
have you studied?
all night. I'm freaked out.
C'mere.
check your messages.
whoa. Gee, thanks, man.
courtesy of my cousin Bob.
took the test last week. Cool.
listen up. All right?
now, just a reminder...
science fair projects are due one week after vacation.
Oh, come on!
it's gonna be a great fair this year.
there's lots of great exhibits.
um, you have tests sitting in front of you.
Noah, you're not an ameba.
you have a spine. Use it, sit up straight.
that goes for all of you. Come on, you guys.
let's get focused here.
you have 30 minutes...
...and begin.
so, how d'you do?
total choke.
you didn't use the text I sent you.
Mr. White coughed. I think he saw.
you're such a wuss. Hey, look at this.
whoa. I'm in the front...
I have times four.
Hey, dude, d'you wanna come over?
can't. Leaving for Whidbey in an hour.
Whidbey?
for Easter vacation?
how lame! - Tell me about it.
Hey!
Oh, hey, sweetheart, how's it going?
I packed up the car already.
you were supposed to be home.
listen, we're gonna leave first thing in the morning.
I promise. But you gotta tell the kids there was nothing I could do about it.
Oh, sweetheart. - I'm sorry.
I'm gonna get home late so eat without me, ok?
Emma, where are you? We're eating.
coming, mom! - Ok.
know what? It snapped.
Oh, honey, sit down, we can fix it later.
please.
no, you're the sensitive little genius.
why don't you do it?
I can't do it.
I don't have dexterity.
Dexterity? What kind of mutant are you?
Noah. Fine.
Where's the stupid string?
it's in my stupid hand.
why couldn't I have a normal sister like everyone else?
come on, sit down...
so that we can eat like a family, ok?
Yuck!
they killed it!
how else would you eat it?
mommy, I don't understand. - What?
why did they have to kill it?
he didn't do anything to anyone.
what about that chopped-up cow you're eating?
what chopped-up cow?
what do you think hamburger is?
did you have to?
you there?
dad! - Heh!
you're home. - Yeah.
Hey, I'm sorry about tonight, ok?
OK?
Oh, you're in a bad mood, are you?
is it 'cause I'm late?
Hm? What is it?
your sister or school, what is it?
school! School sucks!
OK.
what else? Ahhh.
what else?
life sucks. - Life sucks.
I suck. - You suck.
all right. Well, just put it on pause for a second...
...because I wanna tell you, you're probably right.
because sometimes life does suck...
...and sometimes school sucks, but...
...you're completely wrong on the Noah Wilder front.
I should know, I mean I've lived with him for...
how old are you? 10?
10 years.
and, uh, I will put it in writing...
...money-back guarantee, full warranty...
...Whatever you want, to tell you...
...that Noah Wilder does not suck.
in fact...
...he's the greatest kid I know.
Y- Yeah? Yeah?
sorry, hope I didn't wake you up.
no, no.
Ah, no, no, listen...
if he accepts the motion, we're done.
don't you dare, I'll be there in 20 minutes.
Oh!
sorry, Jo. Take the kids to Whidbey, I'll be there later.
come on, get out.
come on, sweetie. Get out!
isn't it pretty?
Oh, look at it, it is so beautiful!
I'll get the keys.
Oh, look at it!
I love this place.
Oh, careful. You ok?
the magic staircase.
up you go. - Magic?
well, kinda.
Noah, no! Mommy said you have to wait!
man, it's cold.
Oh, it's really cold.
cold water.
what's that?
I don't know. I'll go see.
let me.
no, don't.
I wonder if it opens.
what's that?
I don't know.
read the directions.
do you see any directions?
come on in, guys.
keep it a secret.
dinner's almost on, you coming down?
Yeah, in a sec.
what is that? - Oh, it... I don't know.
em and I found it on the beach.
let me see.
look at all those triangles.
make a nice paperweight.
Mim...Mimzy.
Mimzy.
Mimzy?
Mimzy.
what are you doing, Em?
get out of my stuff.
what's that new stuff?
and what's that bunny rabbit?
Where'd they come from?
she was on the side.
no she wasn't.
I think she's the Easter bunny.
Ya-Da-Da da-Da. Give me that.
give this to me. No.
give it... - No.
now look what you did. Give me those.
what are they for?
it's like she's talking to me.
Yeah, right.
like this?
it's a spinner, Noah.
uh...
what...
how did you do that?
I did like this.
no, smooth.
close your eyes.
what is this stuff?
Wow!
Whoa!
Oh, sheesh.
no, don't!
are you crazy?
do you even know what just happened to your hand?
is it ok?
this stuff could be dangerous.
maybe we should tell someone.
I showed the green glass thing to mom.
she thought it was a paperweight.
maybe other people don't see what we see.
maybe you can use these for your science project.
I'm not even gonna do a science project.
morning, Mr. Willpower. - Morning.
I thought you were dieting.
I thought you were meditating.
aren't you supposed to be in Nirvana?
I am.
Larry, are you seriously eating that?
I haven't had anything to eat in 8 hours.
Oh, really? That's called sleeping.
here. Come on.
Oh, my goodness.
ha! No. - Yes.
I am not so easily tempted.
what about him? - Hey, stop it!
Ah, let me focus.
I had another one of those dreams last night.
were there any lotto numbers?
no, no numbers. Just that...
that same light and that...
spinning mandala shape...
coming down at me. - Oh, are you sure?
because sometimes you forget. Historically, you've been...
no, no numbers. Just, god, ever since we left Nepal...
it's that same dream. I don't get it.
it's like the shape is...
...sucking me into it.
it's... It...
don't talk.
just... Just try not to lose it.
just...
see if it can...
come back to you, then... you can remember...
you're trying to get numbers out of me.
no, I'm not... - There were no numbers.
it's so sad.
Oh, we could've been so rich.
could you imagine how many people we could've helped......with that money?
Naomi, let it go, ok?
it was a year and a half a go, it just happened once.
it was a total fluke.
Larry, you dreamt all six numbers of a winning lottery ticket.
we could've won 18 million dollars. - Million dollars, I know.
how was that a fluke, Larry?
come on, I'm sorry. I know.
Oh, really? Is this what's going on right now?
it is, mm-Hm.
you think you can just...
...kiss your way back... - I do.
you know what? It's Easter vacation, let's celebrate.
you're not allowed to... - Got you.
I tagged you.
you're it. - Oh...
you're not gonna get me, you can't get me.
you can't get me.
I'm gonna get you.
em!
Oh. Man, that feels good.
you got some pretty intact sand dollars there.
they're nice.
reminds me of Mr. White.
try it. This is Mimzy's shell.
sweet!
wasn't that just the most beautiful day, huh?
the beach...
sweetie, come here, I'm cold, I need a cuddle.
Yeah, let's... Aww.
that's good. Now I'm nice and warm.
God, look at it.
it's so beautiful.
I love this. - Me too.
look at all the stars, mommy. - Yeah.
it's so big.
are we the only people in the universe?
that is a very big question...
and, um, nobody really knows, honey.
I don't think we are.
I think you're probably right.
so what do you say, guys?
uh, how about we make some s'mores, hm?
well, actually, I'm not hungry.
I'm full too.
my tummy's so full I'm gonna go upstairs.
m- Me too, I'm... I'm kinda tired, em.
we can do s'mores tomorrow, ok, mom?
I have a girlfriend named Marcie.
but she doesn't always like me.
she thinks I'm too smart.
and the girls in my class...
...don't talk to me.
because I like astronomy...
...and I play the violin.
Mimzy. - I know, I'm your friend too.
tea, ladies?
what's in there?
what did I just do?
how did you do that, Noah?
I don't know, with my brain?
I just looked at it and it...
disappeared.
it's not funny!
it is to me.
you better clean that up.
you're not the boss of me, ok?
Hey, Noah, Mimzy knows things.
Oh, yeah? What kind of things?
I think she reads minds.
she knows all about us.
like what?
she knows our names...
...where we were born...
...and what kind of French fries I like.
that's nice.
and you know what else?
she said dad's gonna call.
that's daddy.
come on, Mimzy.
Hey, guess what? - I know. Daddy's coming.
well, how do you know that? He just called me from the car.
Mimzy told me. - Yeah, Mimzy told her.
daddy! Daddy's here!
daddy! Yay!
daddy, daddy, daddy! - That's dad, all right.
daddy's coming! - Come on, let's go.
Hey, guys! - Daddy, yay!
daddy's here! - C'mere, Em.
Hey, bud.
how are ya? Huh?
Oh, I'm happy to see you guys!
Hi! - Hey, you!
home at last.
and they said we're just looking for carrots...
...and there were no carrots there.
mom, can you tell a joke? Oh.
and they were really dreaming of carrots.
come on, come on, tell a joke!
Hey, did you... - Come on.
I don't know what's got into them.
you know, Emma, she just hangs onto that rabbit...Day and night.
and Noah, it's just like he's on another planet...
you know?
they're not my babies any more.
Aww. No, it's true.
you know, we haven't played one board game...
...since we've been here. Not one.
yeah? - You know, we've barely talked...
apart from at dinner...
and then they run off before they're done, I...
it's really different, I...
they're growing up.
they'll always be your babies, Jo.
our babies.
all right. - Thanks, Mike.
grab the bucket, ok.
all right, here we go.
this one's for you.
why are you giving me a club?
dad, I'm not gonna play golf, am i?
Ah, come on, we're gonna give it a try.
all right.
Noah...
come give it a try.
no, dad, you know I suck at sports.
Oh, now this is not a sport...
this is an obsession. Come on.
come on, you're gonna like this.
OK.
now, you wanna line up, right?
there you go. Just get in position.
now, you don't wanna kill it.
you don't wanna kill it, all right?
you just wanna let the gravity...
...just glide the club right down to the ball.
all right, now then, it's not about strength...
...It's about control.
OK?
you ready? Ho-Ho-Ho. Hold on. Hold on.
just want to see right where you are here.
OK.
whoa, baby!
I think we've found your sport.
and this, ladies and gentlemen...
...is a basic outline of the story of DNA...
and of the doctors Watson and Crick...
...who cracked the genetic code that controls all living things.
and we now believe...
...that genes don't just control the way we look.
but also how we think and how we act...
...and how we feel.
so, when people mess with mother nature...
look out.
because pollutants can change us.
and not just chemical and biological ones...
cultural ones as well.
perfectly good DNA becomes a bunch of useless junk...
...carried from generation to generation.
and, uh, as a case in point I'd like you to meet...
...a very special friend of mine.
this is Charlie.
he'd like to say hello, he's a little shy.
how you doin'? You don't wanna come out?
no, I think you should.
gotcha!
EW! Gross!
Oh, yes...
gross, oh, that's right.
this is what happens when you screw with the code.
and don't tell your parents i said the word "screw."
please.
this is what happens when pollutants...
...contaminate DNA.
let Charlie be a warning. This could happen to us.
you wanna end up with two heads? I don't think so.
this can happen to all living things...
and in fact, it may be happening right now.
then why don't they do something?
why don't they stop it?
excellent question, Wendy.
why don't they do something?" "Why don't they stop it"?
who is this "they" that Wendy's referring to...
I wonder, huh?
what do you think?
they" is all of us.
right?
OK, thank you. We'll see you on Wednesday.
keep working on your science fair projects.
you play golf?
no. What's goin' on?
nothing's going on, I mean...
I was bored out of my mind.
Noah! Noah, do you have a sec?
I need to talk to you about this.
Yeah.
I'm outta here, dude.
just relax, Noah, it's ok. It's not about the test...
it's about this.
um... Hey, did you, uh, did you draw this?
Yeah.
OK. Uh, what was your inspiration?
I mean, where did you come up with this design?
I was just scribbling.
I do it all the time.
and I've got a whole bookful.
may I?
here are a few of 'em.
that is incredible.
my favorite one... There's a few.
beautiful.
do you know what these are called?
no.
they're actually called mandalas.
have you ever seen one before? - Mandalas.
no. Never...
heard of one or seen.
Noah, would it be all right...
if I borrowed these for a little while?
borrow all you want.
trade you for an A. Only kiddin'. See ya.
sure it's not in one of the other books?
no, it's in here, it's one of the old ones.
I know I've seen it.
there it is.
I knew it.
it's 12th century, it's one of the oldest known.
Oh, my god...
that is incredible.
it's almost an exact match.
and you know something else?
this is the same image......from my dream.
Larry...
Hey, Noah...
you know what time it is?
Yeah, I know, it's late, but...
you gotta see this.
what is this? I mean it's way past your bedtime, bud.
it's... Uh...
what is that?
it's part of my exhibit for the science fair at school.
it's amazing, how did you do that?
it was easy.
first I discovered that spiders are sensitive to sound waves...
...and seem to move when they hear various frequencies.
then I experimented with the frequencies...
...to make them move in specific patterns.
I calculated their movements with my computer...
...and I re-programmed them.
their circular webs started changing into something more elongated.
I call it...
...the structured bridge.
this geometric design is extraordinarily strong...
...and would be equal to a beam that could hold...
...1, 000 pounds per square inch.
did he do this on his own? Did you help him?
no, he's done it all by himself.
he's just, sort of, taken off all of a sudden.
you know, in the last month or so.
his sister is highly gifted too.
Mm. No, no, no, no.
this is more than highly gifted.
this is genius.
he's gonna win the national science fair.
...that exist today, a bridge of this type...
...could span the entire solar system.
are there any questions?
wait, did that say Mimzy?
uh, yep.
let me see.
look, she's got Mimzy too.
with the white rabbit? - Yeah.
OK. - And this is Mimzy.
she came here to find me.
I don't know why.
white rabbit, just like in the book.
you know, he was the one who was always late......for a very important date.
where did you get it?
we found her on the beach.
Noah thinks she's from outer space...
but he doesn't really know.
outer space.
do you believe in aliens?
aliens? Like flying saucers and things like that?
Yeah, I guess I do, sort of.
Noah does too.
Oh, well... boys.
do you think aliens would ever come here?
some people think they might be here right now...
...and we don't even know it.
Really?
but what do they want?
I don't know.
Noah doesn't know if they're good or bad...
they might help us or kill us...
...or maybe steal our brains.
steal our brains?
if I show you something promise you won't tell?
Oh. Like... a secret?
Really? Cool!
what kind of secret?
I can do a magic trick with my hand.
Really? Yeah. Show me.
OK. Whoop... Thank you.
that's, um... That's...
that's a really great magic trick, Em.
honey, c'mere.
sweetheart, please, come here!
come here, ok? No!
Oh, my god. - It's ok.
it doesn't hurt. Watch.
Oh, my god! No! No! No! Uh!
Julie! Julie! Wait up! What's wrong? Don't you wanna get paid?
I... I gotta go! I gotta go home!
Julie, what's wrong? - Honey, are you ok?
what happened? - Nothing.
what happened? What did you do?
nothing, daddy. I just showed her a magic trick.
you know what? I'll call Julie in the morning.
I'm sure it was nothing.
it's not just Julie...
it's everything.
I mean what about Noah's science project, huh?
how did he do that all by himself?
I mean, usually he struggles, he needs my help...
...and suddenly he's in a league of his own.
I mean, something is just not right.
what's not right? Look, we got two special kids...
...with great minds, imaginations, it's...
no, you're not getting it!
you know, I'm scared. I...
that... It's... It's just not normal.
don't talk like that.
look, you're overreacting to this whole...
David, stop it. Open your eyes.
I think we need to do something.
we have to get help.
Yeah, well, all right, we'll get help. Um...
what kinda help?
No! Uh!
what was that?
Hey, George! What's goin' on?
stop messin' around, this isn't funny.
whoa, I just lost power in sector 4.
Keith, see if you can't reroute power through substation 5.
sector 3's offline.
homeland security?
Yeah, no kidding.
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, Noah, you all right? - Daddy, what's happening?
Hey, sweetie. It's... It's a blackout.
the whole neighborhood's dark.
did you guys hear that sound?
they're saying that it's blacked out half the state.
unbelievable.
they don't know what's caused it.
no, well, they... They will.
they always know exactly how these things start.
they do? - Oh, yeah.
Yeah! - That didn't last long.
are you ok?
I'm goin' down there now.
Oh, man, it's been a crazy morning.
the FBI, the Pentagon's been calling.
look, I can't talk right now, Bill.
well, somebody has to have the keys.
look, Bill, just get everybody down there now.
it's Lorna. - Who?
your daughter, Nate. She wants to know what's happening.
tell her so does the president, he wants to know too.
Hey, baby, you know where my computer codes are?
he'll call you back, honey.
did you try your dresser, under your underwear?
ahh, got it.
I knew you should never have agreed to this.
you had a perfectly good job at the justice department...
and now, all of a sudden, you're a terrorism expert.
look, baby, the national director appointed me.
what do you want me to do, call in sick?
but no one ever actually thought you'd...
I mean, this is Seattle, Nate.
why would terrorists attack Seattle?
I don't know, Sheila. Look, we got the Boeing plant...
we got Microsoft...
we got the music experience.
I don't know, babe. I gotta go.
I'll call you later, baby.
Nate... - Huh?
your fly. - Who?
zip up your fly.
Oh, oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you. I love you, baby.
it grew right in front of my eyes.
I moved stuff inside the crystal...
and then... then whoosh.
half of the state blacked out.
what do you think it is, Noah?
I don't know...
but we have to throw it out.
all of them, all of the toys.
everything, it's just too dangerous.
No!
em, what if something terrible's about to happen?
that won't happen. - How do you know?
Mimzy told me.
Mimzy, she's one of them.
she came with them.
...tesseract. Acute, hexagon. Rhomboid...
acute, tesseract, pyramidal, octahedron...
acute, helix...
Whoa!
good morning. Good morning, everyone.
morning. - Morning, sir.
for those of you who don't know, I'm regional director Nathaniel Broadman.
and this is briefing one of alert 22d.
I think this is the day we've been training for, everybody.
look, we're gonna do this right, we're gonna do it by the book.
Stu, you're up first. What do you got?
this is from NSA, uh...
global positioning has zeroed in...
on the Queen Anne section of Seattle.
no suspicious net chatter.
how could a surge like that originate from a residential neighborhood?
that's what we wanna find out.
I got a very bad feeling about this one.
this is important.
no, I'm not taking them to the emergency room.
look, uh, I know Dr. Sherman very well.
please get him to call me.
eat up, guys.
can you get me some orange juice?
can you "please" get me some orange juice?
I had a strange dream last night.
I dreamed about a bridge.
what kind of bridge? - I don't know what kind.
I dreamed that they were gonna build a really big one.
across the whole universe.
and you know what?
it's gonna come right to our house.
Hello, Noah. - Mr. White.
who is it, Noah? - Is your mother ar...
Oh, hello, Mrs. Wilder.
I'm so sorry to barge in on you like this.
I was gonna call but I thought it would be better......if I came by in person.
this is Naomi.
hello. - Do you have a minute?
uh, sure, come on in. - Great.
OK, thank you.
we've put an explosive charge in your head.
does that sound familiar?
the Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?
I gave it to you.
Ethan, where's the Rabbit's Foot?
wait... What are you saying? That wasn't it?
what I gave you, was that... - I'm going to count to 10.
you're going to tell me where the Rabbit's Foot is or she dies.
Jules, it's going to be okay.
it's going to be okay. Do you understand?
you listen to me. I got exactly what you asked for.
did you want something else?
if there was a misunderstanding, I will fix it.
I can get it, whatever you want.
listen. Talk to me. We can talk, like gentlemen.
three. - God!
all right. All right, all right.
I know where the Rabbit's Foot is.
I can help you.
the way you helped me on the airplane?
that way?
you put the gun down. I'm not talking to you like this.
that's your choice. Four.
the Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.
you want to know where in Paris? Then let her go.
cause you will not... - It's not in Paris. Five.
I can get it for you.
but you kill her, you do this, you get nothing.
six. - Are you listening to me?
the only way you're going to get what you want is for you to...
do you think I'm playing? - Son of a bitch!
do you think I'm playing? You don't think I'll do it?
where is it? Where the hell is it?
look at me. - Where the hell is it?
stay with me. - Seven! Seven!
I am going to kill you. I swear to God I'm going to kill you!
eight! - No, please.
please. Don't do this. Just let her go.
I promise you. I promise you.
I can figure out how to get whatever... - Nine.
listen to me. Listen to me.
I want to help you.
I want to help you get whatever you want.
but you got to do what's right. What you know is right.
no. No.
no.
ten. - Don't!
ten. - Don't!
what are you doing? - Your brother wants another one.
Oh, God, no. Ethan, that's what we talked about...
I'm watching him. He's fine. - That's how it is with Rick.
he's fine and then suddenly he's naked and he's hugging everybody.
I'll take full responsibility for Rick. - You will? Full?
well, mostly full. - It's a huge responsibility.
it's going well, right?
it's going really well. - Yeah.
Julia, your sister's here.
give me a hug. - You look so beautiful.
I don't know about that. So, is this him?
I hope so. - Oh, come here. Oh, gosh.
all right. Mom's dying to see you.
I can't believe you guys came all the way to Virginia.
like we'd miss your engagement...
when Julia called and told me that she was getting married, I had one thought, that it was just too bad that Daddy wasn't here to walk her down the aisle.
and then when Julia told me... Thanks, Mom.
that Ethan doesn't have his parents anymore, either,
I got really sad.
but it occurred to me that this is about starting a new family and how beautiful that is.
and I just want to say I am making Julia an aunt, so I expect the same treatment very, very soon.
Cheers!
department of Transportation?
I've been there over 10 years now. Wow.
what do you do at the DOT?
I study traffic patterns.
you hit the brakes for a second, just tap them on the freeway, you can literally track the ripple effect of that action across a 200-mile stretch of road, because traffic has a memory.
it's amazing. It's like a living organism.
freshen that up for you? What is it, vodka, martini?
Yeah. Thanks.
ladies, do you need...
I'd marry him. - I would, too.
okay, so, a three-week heli-boarding honeymoon?
okay, you actually get dropped... - From a helicopter, yeah.
it's how they met. - Really?
tell her the story. - There's no story.
it is a good story. Tell the story.
first of all, no one was ever good enough for Julia.
Oh, here we go.
not spontaneous enough, adventurous enough, funny enough...
you know what? No, that's not true. You make it sound like I've never dated.
no one we liked.
that is true. - That is true.
then she goes and gets in a chopper that takes off from this lake...
what was the name of that lake? - Lake...
lake Wanaka. Wanaka.
Wanaka. Thank you.
he heard that? - How did he hear that?
and the hospital's cool with you taking three weeks?
Yeah, I'm not the only nurse employed there, you know.
I'm psyched that you're going to be my brother, man.
so am I, Rick.
no, it's awesome. I think it's going to be sick.
me, too, man. I just got to get the phone.
you rock hard. - Okay.
Hello?
is this Mr. Ethan Hunt? - Yes, it is.
this is Ready-Travel Resort Services.
we'd like to offer you a chance to win an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.
we ran out of ice. I'll be back in 10 minutes.
Oh, no. Can't somebody else go? - No, I got it.
I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy.
thank you.
$1. 86.
thanks for coming. Can't decide what size Slurpee to get.
I usually go for the 900-ouncer.
how's that party? Sorry I had to call you.
Yeah, you should have come. - You should have invited me.
you know I would have. - Thanks.
I know we joke about it, but I am always this close to begging you to stop training our people and get your ass back in the field.
but that's not what you do anymore, and so I respect that choice.
you know I do. Family's everything.
come on, John. What's going on?
it's Agent Farris.
she was on an operation.
she's disappeared. Been off-grid 11 hours.
I'm sending in Search and Rescue. I was hoping you'd want in.
you've got good people for that.
Yeah. Yep, that we do.
wheels up at sunrise if you have a change of heart.
take some pictures of the party for me.
Ethan. Three days ago, Agent Lindsey Farris was captured while on a surveillance operation.
this is the man she was tracking. His name is Owen Davian.
details are eyes-only, but I can tell you that Davian's a black-market trafficker.
extremely dangerous and a priority for us.
at 1400 hours today, a recon satellite ID'd a caravan of vehicles with plates matching those known to have been used by Davian's operatives.
they stopped at a derelict factory outside Berlin.
it appears they have a hostage. We believe it's Agent Farris.
normally we would disavow, but Lindsey may be the key to getting us closer to Davian, and that's a risk we need to take.
your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find Lindsey and bring her home.
I've already assembled a team.
I have them standing by, awaiting your word.
this message, let's call it my excellent engagement gift to you, will self-destruct in five seconds.
good luck, Ethan, and thanks again.
am I ready?
you okay? - Yeah.
Yeah.
you know, I'm sorry. I realized I didn't tell you that the office called during the party. I have to go to Houston for a night.
metro's having a public transpo conference.
it's so last-minute. - I know.
well, well, well.
now, if it isn't Mr. "Those Who Can't Do, Teach
back in the field.
what's up, baby? - Hey, man.
Hey, Ethan, don't worry. We're going to get the girl.
or have you been away so long you've forgotten how good we are?
welcome back, brother.
is our truck in place?
weapons good to go?
Yeah. You? - Yeah.
you know I got your six.
Hey, man. That's your job.
guns one, activated. Guns two, activated.
guns three, activated. Guns four, activated.
guns ready.
all four guns operational.
they've got men on the second, third, fourth floors.
I count 14 of them.
observer, I'm in approach position.
Roger that. Stand by.
target match.
the prize is on the sixth floor. Two Tangos with her.
moving in.
so, Raider One, at some point, we got to go over this whole "getting married" thing.
negative, Observer.
I don't respect you nearly enough to have that conversation.
you may not respect me, but for now you're stuck with my voice in your head.
so, this girl, what the hell do you see in her anyway?
who, Julia? You've never met her.
Yeah, and the way things are, I probably never will.
lucky for her, right? That's what you're thinking.
they've got communications gear.
two Tangos, second floor, northwest corridor.
groundhog, that's you.
you need to grab that gear on the second floor as soon as we go hot.
copy that. I'll need two minutes, which means you'll need me in one, right?
Yeah, just about.
Raider One, make a left at the top of the stairs.
the prize should be at the end of the hall.
Phoenix, I have eye on the prize.
give her 10 cc's more.
call me when she wakes. - Okay.
we need touchdown in less than three. Do you copy?
Roger that, I copy.
please, when do I not copy? All I do is copy.
stand by to go live. On my mark.
one. Execute.
warning. Warning.
Raider One, you're clear. Move!
Lindsey. Lindsey.
Ethan?
I'm going to get you home.
observer, I've got the prize. Evac in three.
Roger that.
this is adrenaline. Lindsey, you're going to feel this.
groundhog, second floor is clear.
on the move!
observer, we're on the move.
evac in 90 seconds. - Roger that.
Phoenix, get to the LZ now.
Roger, Observer. On my way.
Ethan. I have to talk to you.
come on, come on. - I have to talk to you right now!
just for you. Turn off your transmitter.
do it, Ethan!
Ethan!
Lindsey! Moving! - Moving!
mag!
ready to move.
we evac from here.
get down!
I'm out. How many rounds you got?
enough.
now I'm out.
t minus five, baby.
Lindsey, hold on to me.
Luther!
rolling!
God! My head! What is that?
what is... - Is she okay?
Lindsey! Let's get to the chopper.
zhen, get rid of the truck.
let's go!
God! What is that? You can't hear that?
Oh! God! - What's wrong with her?
let's go! - We loaded?
Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!
go, go, go, go, go!
son of a bitch. - No!
guys, we got company. I'm going to try and lose them.
hurts so much.
turn it off. Please.
please, Ethan.
guys, their missiles are hot!
incoming! Hold on.
okay. That was lucky. We only get one of those.
do we have a defibrillator?
Ethan, turn it off!
bring it on!
Ethan! What is it? Did they put something in my head?
they injected you with a time-release charge.
do you remember that? - No. Time-release...
an explosive. They've activated it.
it's gonna detonate unless we fry the charge, - which is what we're gonna do. - No, Ethan.
zap her like that, you'll stop her heart.
then I'll zap her again and bring her back.
do it!
guys! They're firing another one!
Ethan! - Zhen!
zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!
I want you to set it for 150. - 150.
Lindsey, I'm gonna short out the explosive in your head.
you're gonna be okay. - It'll need 30 seconds.
damn it.
twenty-five seconds! - Come on.
we're almost there.
they have us locked. - Twenty seconds.
hold on.
I got them!
ten seconds. - Almost there. Almost there.
give me the paddles.
Ethan. Thank you.
shit.
Hey.
Hey.
how did it go?
I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.
I'm just tired.
I read your training brief on Agent Farris.
the words you used were "beyond capable.
that still stand, Mr. Hunt?
Mr. Brassel... - Does it stand?
Yes, sir, it does.
because we've got a corpse downstairs that says otherwise.
killed by a detonator implanted in her skull through the nasal cavity.
Mr. Brassel, it's unacceptable to judge Agent Farris' competence based...
it's unacceptable that chocolate makes you fat, but I've eaten my share. And guess what?
now, I approved Agent Farris' surveillance op based on your evaluations, Mr. Hunt, of a woman who allowed herself to be captured.
so you go to recover her. You encounter a dozen men.
you don't grab any of them?
our objective, Mr. Brassel, was to recover Agent Farris.
Davian employs a cellular structure at his organization.
the men there more than likely had no information...
who's drawing these conclusions? Is it you?
I am, sir. Based upon... - I'm not on you yet.
you allowed Farris to board your chopper without a scan.
that explosive device could have taken you all out.
there is one reason that you are sitting here before me today, and that is luck.
because your operation was poorly conceived and executed worse.
two laptops were recovered... - I'm aware of that.
we've talked to Tech Services.
they doubt if they can reconstitute the drives.
"Crispy," I believe, is what they called them. Worthless.
Mr. Brassel, as Operation Manager of this office, - I have the authority... - Excuse me.
did you just throw a title at me, Mr. Musgrave?
I don't care if your daddy plays golf with the President.
this is Intelligence. So far I haven't seen any.
you think this op was worth the risk, Mr. Hunt.
what do you know about Owen Davian?
he was the one who brought gas centrifuge technology to Korea from Pakistan.
he was also the man who sold Toxin Five to the Armahad Republic Jihad.
he is a man who provides, provides, provides!
and he remains invisible. He's a goddamn invisible man.
wells, not Ellison, in case you want to be cute again.
we can't find him.
he knows it. It's emboldened him.
I've been trying to bring Davian down since the day that I got here.
do you know what I've got for it?
it's never been confirmed the Toxin Five theft was Davian.
Mr. Musgrave, please don't interrupt me when I'm asking rhetorical questions.
your operation has achieved one thing.
you have reminded Davian that he is winning.
and now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go inform Mr. And Mrs. Farris that their baby girl was killed in a head-on collision on l-95.
I stand here today deeply saddened by the death of one of God's children, Lindsey Elizabeth Farris.
it is always startling when the Lord takes one of our young so unexpectedly.
be aggressive. Come on. Stay focused. Keep your knees bent. Good. Good.
now, to fire the lock, the extractor has to be...
that bag's not going to hit you back. Hit harder.
don't rely on your sights. Keep your eyes dead on the target...
attack me. Come on.
don't ever release the firing pin unless the extractor's...
good. There you go. Good.
identify the target. Point and shoot. It's very simple. You point and shoot.
stay focused.
miss Farris, you know how many recruits I've trained.
I'm proud to say that you are the first that I've recommended for active field duty.
Congratulations.
am I ready?
yes?
is this Mr. Kelvin?
Yes. Who is this?
I'm calling from Norfolk Mail Service.
Lindsey Farris rents a post office box here.
she sent you a piece of mail from Berlin and asked us to call you when it arrived.
it came this morning.
thank you.
this right here. - Thanks.
it's a microdot.
a microdot with nothing on it. This is unusual.
Lindsey wouldn't send me a blank microdot.
I'm telling you, man, there's no image.
then you're not looking in the right place.
where the hell am I supposed to look?
there's not much square footage to this thing.
why would Lindsey send me a blank microdot?
I don't know. Why would Lindsey send you anything?
you were her instructor, not her handler.
listen, man. I don't mean to cross the line, but was there something going on between you two?
you and Lindsey.
Lindsey was like my little sister.
and you never slept with your little sister, right?
Hey, brother, if I don't ask you, who will?
maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.
well, that's old school.
if she was in a hurry and only had access to black-market gear, maybe.
could you get the tools to read it? - I might know a guy.
magnetic means encrypted. - Yeah, I know that.
Yeah. Be right there.
the thing about Lindsey is she was brand-new.
she was sweet. Remember when you were sweet?
can you remember that far back? - Yeah, well, barely.
in Germany, you asked me what it is I see in Julia.
what I see in Julia is life before all this.
and it's good.
Benji, what have you got?
well, these hard drive platters are just fried.
Yeah. - You know, they made a mess of them.
it's just like... There's holes in them and stuff.
and it's got scorched all the way through. And then...
look, this one's got a hole in it and stuff.
I can't believe. I can't even look at it.
Benji. Did you recover anything? - Yes. Yes.
despite the aforementioned conditions of the hard drive you brought back, I managed to recover portions of two dozen e-mail files.
your Mr. Davian is going to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow and attend a function at one Vatican City.
what the hell is Davian doing at the Vatican?
it's all got to do with the "Rabbit's Foot.
rabbit's Foot?
Yeah, well, I'm assuming it's like a code word for something he's about to sell to an unspecified buyer, for $850 million, by the way. Or maybe it's not a code word.
maybe it's just a really, really expensive bunny appendage.
you have no idea what it is?
it's interesting. I used to have this professor at Oxford, okay?
Dr. Wickham, his name was, and he was like this massive, fat guy.
you know, huge, big guy. We used to call him...
you know... Well, I won't tell you what we used to call him.
he taught biomolecular kinetics and cellular dynamics, and he used to sort of scare the underclassmen with this story about how the world would eventually be eviscerated by technology.
you see, it was inevitable that a compound would be created, which he referred to as the "Anti-God.
it was like an accelerated mutator, a sort of, you know, like an unstoppable force of destructive power that would just lay waste to everything.
to buildings and parks and streets and children and ice cream parlors, you know?
so whenever I see, like, a rogue organization, willing to spend this amount of money on a mystery tech, I always assume it's the Anti-God.
end-of-the-world kind of stuff, you know?
but, no, I don't have any idea what it is. I was just speculating.
did you brief Musgrave on this? - Who, me? No, not yet.
good. Don't. - What?
don't tell anyone about this. - This took me ages.
if something goes wrong with the operation, I want Musgrave to have deniability.
that's great work, Benji. - What operation?
that look in your eye is a pain in my ass.
you know that, right?

Ethan, what's going on?
I keep thinking you just need time to tell me whatever it is that it's...
but nothing in my mind makes sense.
Yeah.
what's wrong?
what are you not telling me?
I need to ask you for something.
and it's the most...
I need you to trust me.
of course I trust you.
am I ever going to be able to understand what this is?
I need you to trust me.
Yes.

charity event. Vatican City.
our mission is to get in and kidnap Davian.
I don't know why he's so happy.
I did remind him that the Vatican is the Vatican.
a 109-acre sovereign state in the middle of Rome, surrounded by a 60-foot wall, which is monitored 24/7, with over 200 CCTV cameras.
that's not even what makes it a challenge.
getting Davian is good. But getting his buyers is even better.
if they realize he's been grabbed, they'll disappear.
I'm sorry, what are you saying?
no matter how we grab Davian, his clients are gonna know he's been taken.
no, they won't. Access point is here.
it's a one-way street adjacent to the Vatican wall.
I'll need 30 seconds. And we'll need a truck.
now we've pissed off every Italian in Rome, go do what you got to do.
don't forget the smoke. - Yeah.

I know that. Thanks.

I don't agree with that. - Then I'm smarter than you.
I'm going up. I agree with Luther.
we can't have real relationships. But you see, I love that.

Really? - Yeah, really.

Davian just picked up a briefcase.
we're going to have to move sooner than we thought.

I'm not proud of it. I'm not happy about it, but I've lived with women a few times, and it doesn't ever make it to two years.
you can't. - Thanks for the advice, but it's different for me than it is for you, you know?
I'm not in the field anymore. - Oh, okay.
here's a retirement present.
in our job, there's always going to be something between you and a woman.
always.
Luther, listen. - Dishonesty.
a dishonesty that poisons everything.
I think I need to tell you something...
stop talking. This isn't about you, Ethan.
and whoever this girl is, you're going to end up messing up her life, too.
don't do it.

Congratulations.

Ethan Hunt and his team just grabbed Owen Davian in Rome.
they're headed back now. I thought you should know.
you were aware of this operation?
Yes, I was.
then good work.
thank you.
you're dead, Mr. Davian.
there were witnesses.
that was you in the bathroom.
now, you're going to tell us everything.
every buyer you've worked with. Every organization.
what the hell is your name?

it's up to you how this goes.

I'm going to find her, whoever she is,
I'm going to find her, and I'm going to hurt her.
you were apprehended carrying details of the location of something code named the Rabbit's Foot.
I'm going to make her bleed, and cry, and call out your name.
and you're not going to be able to do shit. You know why?
what is the Rabbit's Foot?
because you're going to be this close to dead.
and who is the buyer?
and then I'm going to kill you right in front of her.
I'm going to ask you one more time. - What's your name?
what is the Rabbit's Foot? - Who are you?
and who is the buyer?
you don't have any idea what the hell is going on, do you?
I mean, you saw what I did to your little blonde friend at the factory, right?
well, that was nothing. That was fun.
that was fun.

Ethan, stop!

Ethan! - What is the Rabbit's Foot?

Ethan, stop! Don't do it.

brassel sent me to Germany to surveil an exchange, to ID a man named Owen Davian.
the following story is fictional and does not depict actual person or event
Boone STANDS ALONE
38578.0
where the hell have you been?
you are 20 minutes late, and this is our first actual press for this campaign.
I'll make it up to him.
it's going to take a little more than just a charming smile, Dex.
and what do you have on your feet?!
you told me to buy the suit.
you didn't say anything about the shoes.
sorry to hold you up.
I was at the community center.
running that center, must certainly get culture shock compared to corporate litigation, eh?
no comparin.
what I do now matters.
so, uh, what made you decide to jump into the tar pit of municipal politics?
look sharp!
gonna have to get you boys a real hoop one of these days.
sorry about that. Dex is really dedicated to the kids down here.
he's going to need more dedication to knock Grover Boone off his perch.
your guy has got no name, no connections, and no money.
well, he's got something better.
Hey, Eric...
heart.
they move your brother out of the ICU yet?
I'm keeping him in my prayers.
you need anything, you come see me, you hear?
this boy Eric's older brother was walking home the other night, caught a stray bullet.
local dealers flexing muscle at each other.
happens every day out here.
it doesn't make it right, though, does it?
so to answer your question: That's why I'm running for city council.
sixth Street is the biggest drug market in North Philly.
cops can't stop it. Boone can't stop it.
what are you going to do about it?
I'm going to shut the whole thing down.
in other news, police sources said today that murdered city council hopeful,
Dexter Collins, was in possession of a significant amount of crack cocaine, strengthening speculation that the anti-drug candidate struggled with an addiction that led to his death just five days before the election.
bleeding ulcers, man.
I haven't eaten in days.
the prison doctors are useless. I can't take it anymore.
that's something you should've considered beforerobbing five liquor stores.
show some holiday spirit, man. I'm looking at 15 years.
we're looking at a three-hour drive back to Philly.
lawyer said you got something to give?
you know that after-hours joint on Susky?
the Red Rooster?
got it on good authority a lot of those waitresses are pros.
what? You're leaving?
we're Homicide, Luther. We deal in bodies, not hookers.
you're as dumb as you look if you think that weak crap is gonna to fly.
I was just warming up.
I'll see you in 15.
what about him? - He didn't get killed by no drugs.
he was assassinated. Sixth Street Mafia.
and you witnessed this?
a crackhead up at Graterford told me on the cell block, when I serving my last bit.
he saw the whole thing go down.
let's talk to the smokehound.
dead. TB. Last year.
happen to ID the doer before he died?
he said he didn't get a good look.
Aw, that's great. Second-hand BS from a dead witness.
any more garbage you wanna peddle? Hey...
the gun they used-- . 40 caliber SIG?
y'all ever find it?
what's your point?
I know where it is.
there's nothing here.
wait a minute.
40 caliber SIG Sauer.
guess Luther's not as dumb as he looks.
Dexter Collins, found shot to death on Sixth Street, 2:00 in the morning.
looked like a drug deal gone bad.
he was 30 years old, raised in the badlands, full ride at Penn, Yale Law, then Wall Street.
the guy was a lightweight.
he gave it up to be a community activist. Ran for city council.
said he was gonna take on the drug dealers.
anti-drug candidate found shot to death with a crack pipe and a fistful of vials.
the crack thing never jibed to me.
he was a reformer. Refused to take "street money.
said he was going to earn votes, not buy them.
ward bosses must've loved that.
newspapers went to town after his death. Called him the "Crackhead Candidate.
but they never reported this: The autopsy didn't find any drugs in Dex's system.
maybe he hadn't used in a while?
or maybe the drugs were planted.
frame job? - This was a nasty campaign.
Dex was giving Grover Boone a run for his money.
30 years on the city council?
Boone would eat his own children to hold on to his seat.
commissioner created a task force to solve Dex's murder.
two dozen cops, handpicked, hardly any homicide experience.
guess how that went.
so, let's look into Luther's story.
the gun we found is a match as the murder weapon, but there's nothing connecting it to the Sixth Street Mafia.
we need more on Dex Collins than news reports and rumors. Who was close to him?
well, the father, Ronnie Collins, raised Dex by himself.
and also his campaign manager, Cassie Michaels.
re-interview them, but let's not rattle too many cages until we know what we're going at.
I'm going to meet the campaign manager.
something I got to take care of.
who's that?
I keep getting my neighbor's mail.
you might want to stop by the post office.
check it out-- nine o'clock.
Oh, not bad.
you think I got a chance at something like that?
Absolutely.
yeah? - Yeah.
Hey, you. - How's it going, Frankie?
Oh, you know, busy working on my swing.
Yep. - Listen, I got to jet.
see you later?
see ya.
you're an ass.
Dex was special.
we met in law school, and I could tell he was going places, so I jumped at the chance to work on his campaign.
that must've been a shock, the way he died-- murdered in the street like that.
couple questions that never got resolved-- Dex's involvement with drugs for one.
Dex never so much as took a drink as long as I knew him.
I was his campaign manager.
my job was knowing about his skeletons, and he didn't have any.
sounds too good to be true.
well, it's too good for this city. - Meaning?
Philly's political machine has been in place forever.
if you want to run for office, then you need name recognition.
so you pay the ward leaders, in cash, to go spread the good word.
street money.
ostensibly it goes to expenses, but...
mostly it just goes into their pockets.
Dex refused to do that, so he made some enemies.
any of these enemies the type who'd shoot Dex, plant drugs on him?
in my business, we specialize in character assassination. Not the other kind.
so explain what Dex was doing on a known drug corner, dead of night, if it wasn't for drugs.
he was on a mission.
let's get real.
the drug war is over; we lost.
there's a boy, 16 years old, who was shot by drug dealers, died in ICU last night.
his 12-year-old brother cried in my arms, asked me why.
I couldn't tell him that's just how it is on Sixth Street.
I couldn't say, our district leader, Grover Boone, is too busy hosting parties for real estate developers to be accountable for the blood on our street.
I need to answer that boy's question.
give me a chance.
sign my petion to be added to the ballot, and I swear to you, I will always be here and accountable.
your name's Warren, right?
own the Diamond Diner. What's wrong?
I don't need an outsider telling me what it's like on my own street.
I'm not an outsider.
I grew up here.
live here now, just down the block.
well... you sure as hell didn't get that suit on Sixth Street.
come on. Come on.
I, uh... I assure you I, uh, plan to take better care of our district than my apartment.
what's this about?
uh... my dad.
some of you may know him.
every morning he's woken up, knowing he'd have to push a mop all day.
but he's had faith each day his hard work was going to pay off.
that faith gave me a better life.
so every morning, I wake up, I look in the mirror, and I see faith.
I know I can do the same for you.
all I need is your signature.
do you rember those signs painted on sidewalks and bus shelters?
Yeah,"Faith." They were everywhere.
it wasn't even us who did that.
Dex's supporters did it themselves.
end of the day, it wasn't power or politics for Dex.
all he cared about was that damn street.
and he paid for it with his life.
got a hit on the murder weapon, boss.
registered in '04 to a Jay Quincy, a truck driver in Chester.
reported the gun stolen with a couple others a few weeks before Dex's death.
he's done it before, too. Once in Jersey, twice in Delaware.
a straw purchaser. - Lowest of the low.
reports guns stolen and sells them on the street.
figure he sold to Dex's killer.
maybe one of the Sixth Street Mafia.
last cops I talked to were a joke.
they already made up their minds about him. They didn't even know what he was about.
you and your son pretty tight, Mr. Collins?
put everything into Dex.
you understand, I...
I wanted him to have opportunity, get him away from here.
but he came home.
said he wanted to change the way things worked on the streets.
who was I to tell him the street wasn't worth the trouble?
he was going after the dealers.
only one who had guts enough to stand up to them.
what was his reward?
called him the crackhead candidate.
guess that sells more papers than...
faith.
taking a look at the Sixth Street Mafia.
it's about time. - Why is that?
Dex was out there every night trying to save folks, and those gangsters didn't like it one damn bit.
Hey, friend, can I talk to you?
listen, man, you don't have to be doing this.
saying you're not alone.
take my card, come see me.
we can help you get clean, give you options.
you best start moving.
I ain't even playing.
I know you. Victor Nash.
we grew up together. - Yeah, so?
my dad helped us set up that car wash, remember?
two bucks a car. Thought we were some regular Trumps.
Look,'cause we know each other, I'm gonna give you a pass.
go home. Now.
I won't go until all of you go first.
how you plan on pulling that off? You strapped?
I don't got a gun.
I got faith.
but see, I got a gun.
yeah?
but you won't use it.
a screwup from the age of ten.
Dex saw something there worth saving.
for a while, it looked like he was right.
Victor left the corner? - Did odd jobs at the campaign office.
Yeah, but I never trusted him myself.
you don't just walk away from a gang like Sixth Street.
after Dex died, Victor went right back to them.
no questions asked.
Yeah, Scotty. Traffic, huh?
I'll meet you on Sixth Street.
this a private game?
relax, folks. Just looking for someone.
Hey, Victor.
I didn't do nothing.
besides slinging rock, guns, agg assault? That's all in the past?
one of those early achievers, I guess.
Hey, why y'all hassling me?
Dex Collins. - I can't help you.
now, see, that's not how this works.
we ask questions, then you lie.
whoops, a gun.
this the one you pulled on Dex?
that was a misunderstanding.
like hanging around his campaign just before you popped him?
where were you, huh, the night he got shot?
I was at an NA meeting.
I was all messed up; I was getting high, half hoping to get busted or dead.
he helped me.
come on, Victor. Still a soldier.
sixth Street was losing business with his nightly visits to the corner.
Dex reached out to you, and you put one in his chest.
sixth Street was nothing compared to who was really after Dex.
is all this really necessary? - Yes.
Dex, I have every member of the district coming here today.
I have ward leaders and clergy, most of them expecting more than just a free meal.
I'm not paying for votes.
then, you need to convince them to support you.
Dex, champagne's gonna help with that.
I should be out on the corner, not kissing political ass.
you need to do both.
Dex, look, I think that you actually have a shot here, okay, so just straighten this tie and put on a smile.
it's only gonna hurt a little.
what's going on?
I'm Lieutenant Doherty.
this is notification that you're shut down for health violations pending review.
the inspector was here two months ago. There weren't any problems.
you'll have to take that up with the Health Department...
assuming you have a liquor license.
we're hosting a private party here tonight, expecting 150 guests.
not anymore-- building's only zoned for 70.
Oh, are you the fire marshal, too, or just Boone's hatchet man?
Cassie, it's okay.
he's only doing what he's told.
isn't that right, Lieutenant?
man Send the rich boy home.
vote Grover Boone.
he stands alone.
send the rich boy home.
vote Grover Boone.
he stands alone.
Boone is like any other gangster in the street.
he's got muscle, too...only they wear badges.
now I know you're still using, Victor.
saying a cop did Dex Collins, huh?
saying if Boone wanted Dex done, he'd be done.
you fill in e blanks. - Yeah, we'll do that.
you remember how the rest of this goes.
came up in the department with Pat Doherty.
he's never served a day of street duty.
desk jockey, huh? - Political operator.
goes lieutenant to deputy commissioner in two years.
hitched his wagon to Boone. - Not just him.
health Department closes Warren's restaurant in '05.
he files a complaint that gets thrown out.
electricity's shut down in his house the next day.
Yeah, Boone takes no prisoners.
he's not all bad. Hires cops to moonlight for him.
speaks up for us at city hall.
and then condemns us on the 5: 00 news when it hits the fan.
this election got ugly.
Dex's campaign office was broken into, volunteers harassed.
maybe someone went too far.
making extra points for taking out the competion.
meeting with Warren, see if he remembers any rabid Boone supporters.
gonna contact Boone, too.
that's a hornet's nest, Scotty.
I'll handle Boone.
you sold the guns on the street, filed a false report.
not the first time, either. You got a whole side business going.
ain't that right? - I don't recall.
listen, Ray.
it's Jay.
right-- Jay.
I pulled the other reports you filed.
I got them right here.
uh... somewhere.
hang on a second.
seven handguns in Delaware in 2002.
12 in Jersey the next year.
I got bad luck.
don't know the half of it.
one of your guns was used in the shooting of a policeman.
another wounded a little girl on a playground.
now, I'm a cop and a mom, Jay.
you've pissed me off twice already.
then, there's Dex Collins. Sold the gun to the killer.
that's conspiracy.
prove it. - That's why the DA's here, Jay.
to be honest, I'm not that good a lawyer.
add, you know? Makes it hard.
that's why I work this crap job. Oh, here we go, okay, so...
the report says that the guns were stolen from your mother's house, so even when we prove this false -
and we will-- any half-assed public defender's gonna say that we can't connect it to you, so what I'm proposing is...
so I can go.
yeah...
but Mom's gonna have to stay.
like you're gonna arrest an old lady.
you see, Ray, not only are we arresting her, but, uh...
we're gonna convict her, too.
Hey, Mrs. Quincy.
your old lady's gonna spend the rest of her life in a cage thinking one thing:
my son did this to me.
it was a Dominican guy.
hangs out at the Hardware Depot.
jorge Gonzalez. Okay? Anything else?
Yeah, you gonna drink that?
you should have called first, John.
Yeah, would he have called back?
this is about Dex Collins.
I'm looking for a list of supporters from the last campaign.
never gonna happen. - You impeding an investigation?
I'm looking out for you, John.
look, Boone is just gonna refer you to his attorney.
then, he's gonna call the commissioner and have you transferred to the motor pool.
we did a thorough job on this case three years ago.
Dex Collins was killed buying dope.
except you didn't find the doer.
he was probably dead, too-- community service murder.
you don't want to start a riot in the streets by stirring this up.
you worried about a riot in the streets or a riot in city hall?
both.
so, Boone is refusing to cooperate?
did I say that?
come on, John, relax, we're working the same job here.
I do police work, Pat. Not exactly sure what you do.
councilman Boone.
good to see you, Lieutenant. Sorry I can't talk.
do it again real soon.
you paid a big price supporting Dexter Collins during the election, going against the Boone machine.
Yeah, it was tough for a while.
no income, three daughters.
worked 12 hours a day for Dex, then bartended at a club after hours just to get by.
back in business now, though.
Boone cooled off after Dex died.
think it was one of Boone's people? Got overenthusiastic, went after Dex?
well, everybody was kind of crazy.
you know, bricks were thrown, tires slashed, but the worst damage we did to ourselves.
what does that mean?
well, we were doing well in the polls, but, uh, flat broke.
the big donors were afraid of alienating Boone, so we got into bed with the wrong people.
you're saying it was one of Dex's own supporters who took him out?
I'm saying, you lie down with dogs...
he's here. Mulwrey is here.
he's, like, five steps behind me.
I thought you were pitching him. - Yeah, but he said that he wanted to meet you.
Dex, this guy is big money, and he is no bull, okay?
we are one minute away from having our phones repossessed, so, please don't piss him off.
okay, don't preach to him. Just be normal, okay?
we need this - Mr. Mulwrey, um...
why don't you, uh, come into my office?
Mr. Mulwrey? - I've heard enough. You're my guy.
just maybe consider some real shoes.
Oh, my God!
there was 50 grand easy in that case.
street money. - What did Mulwrey want in return?
he was lobbying city hall to redevelop the Chandler Housing Projects.
would have displaced hundreds of poor residents.
Dex spoke out against that during the campaign.
Mulwrey figured he'd buy Dex's silence.
but the next day, Dex held a press conference denouncing the Chandler redevelopment.
so Dex takes the man's money and screws him a day later.
Mulwrey comes out of the construction business.
waste management. Plays by different rules.
you hit him, he hits back.
with a vengeance.
this used to be the Chandler Housing Project, right?
pulled that eyesore down three years ago. Feels good to give back.
I'm sure you relocated all the people who got displaced, too.
the city contracted me to redevelop here.
yeah,'cause you paid 'em off. - But not everyone toed the line.
Dex Collins, for example.
gave him a lot of money to back off.
only he screwed you to the wall with a press conference.
almost ended this cash cow.
it's called the cost of doing business.
as you can see, I ended up on top.
and Dex ended up dead.
Dex and I were straight.
first time in the history of Philly politics that a candidate actually gave money back.
Dex returned the 50 grand?
guy was sincere, I'll give him that.
but a bit too naive for his own good.- Because he was on the up-and-up?
because he didn't know that his campaign manager was taking cash from everyone and putting it on the street.
Cassie Michaels told us they never took a penny of street money.
well, then she lied.
I don't care how charismatic you are.
in ward politics, the bosses don't lift a finger without getting paid.
Cassie went behind his back?
the guy ran his whole campaign on doing things different.
he just didn't know what the other hand was doing.
so, he gave you your money back?
figured he found out what she was up to. Isn't that why he fired her?
what's up with this new DA?
waiting half an hour to start a lineup for our straw purchaser Quincy. Bell's nowhere.
who is this jackass anyway? - Bell's good people.
his dad was a cop. Killed in the line.
car broke down.
recognize any of them, Jay?
hard to say. They all look alike.
let's pretend for a minute that your mom's life depended on it because it kind of does.
number four.
wasn't hard to say, after all.
you held back about the street money.
Dex wasn't taking it, but you were.
well, I was doing my job. - That how Dex saw it?
going behind his back. - He understood.
that why he let you go?
I was good at my job, and he knew that.
well, it was more than that.
I did some background on you two.
you met at Yale. Shared an apartment.
Yeah, we were friends. - With benefits, right?
but the relationship changed. - We went in different directions.
yet you drop everything when he calls.
okay.
what do you want me to say?
you want me to say that I still had a thing for Dex? So what if I did?
it had to be tough.
him wanting you in his camp, just not on his arm.
not in his neighborhood, at least.
you know, in my experience, top motives for murder: love and money.
I didn't kill Dex. - Which was worse, Cassie?
getting fired or dumped?
I was protecting him from himself.
Dex was a saint. But he never understood.
saints don't win elections.
we are about to take down the most powerful member of the city council.
that wouldn't happen without street money.
you don't get it, Cass.
it doesn't count if we play by their rules.
says who? Where is it written that Dex Collins can't work the system?
the system's broken.
I am trying to show people we don't need it anymore.
your ideals are nothing if you lose. They're nothing.
that is why I'm here. Because I keep you grounded.
I put you in the game.
I didn't ask you to.
you think you've done this alone?
if it wasn't for me, you would still be the most popular activist on Sixth Street.
instead, you are a political presence.
just imagine what we can do.
you can't be a part of this anymore.
there's a reporter on the phone from the Inquirer.
wants a comment from Dex about a story for tomorrow.
has to do with June 13, 1987.
I'm sorry. That supposed to mean something?
what did the reporter have?
he never said.
Dex kept things from me, too.
and a day later, he was dead.
Yeah, that's not good enough. Cassie, you were his campaign manager.
his friend. You saying you never found out?
Yeah.
unfortunately, I did.
I've been meaning to tell you how much I admired your son.
of course, - no one's perfect.
cause in 1987, Dex was arrested for dealing drugs.
just like the rest, looking to bring my son down.
I'm looking for the truth.
why didn't you tell me? - It would have given you an excuse to walk away.
you owe Dex more than just sitting vigil for him.
tell me what happened.
cops come to my house one morning.
say they busted Dex for slinging dope the night before.
I said,"No, sir, not my son. You must have got it wrong.
but they were right.
13 years old, and they got him in lockup.
judge suspended the charges because of my boy's academics.
Yeah, did everything I could to keep him off the street.
street still killed him in the end.
juvenile record's sealed, but a reporter found out anyway.
any idea who else could have told him, Ronnie?
Oh, yeah.
Dex's juvenile record.
picked up for distribution of cocaine, June '87.
you were with him.
Dex got off. His father made a deal.
sent him away to a fancy school. But not you, Victor.
Nah, I took the full hit.
24 months at Glen Mills Youth Detention Center.
these cords are sealed. Public has no access to them.
so tell me how the Inquirer found out about it.
you charging me?
only other person who'd remember.
only one who can confirm it. You.
charge me if you're gonna charge me.
call Boone, tell him the job's done.
Oh, you think I answer to Boone?
you police, ain't you?
I answer to him.
you were pissed at Dex for dodging the bullet all those years ago.
making something of himself.
he gave me a second chance. - Right.
as his errand boy.
what else was I good for?
exactly. You were nothing but a thug.
thought you'd take him down a notch.
remind everyone exactly what street Dex comes from.
but what I can't figure out, Victor: why you had to shoot him, too.
I was so high that night, I barely rember what was happening.
go the hell away!
I told you. I...I thought you was a reporter.
where have you been?
in here not feeling too good.
any more?
look, I ain't ever had nobody looking out for me.
Hey, drop that self-pity routine.
the reporter just came.
they wanted me to know about what happened between us back in the day, you know?
I didn't say a word, but gave me money anyway.
doesn't matter, Victor
I said nothing. I don't even know how they found out.
it was Boone.
someone slipped these under my door this morning.
thought it was you.
Boone keeps pushing and pushing.
I'm sick of it.
this ends tonight.
what are you gonna do? - Talk to Boone.
he's got dirt on me, and I've got dirt on him.
photo showed Boone with a woman?
stripper from the Oasis Club.
he was doing her for months while his wife was sick and dying in the hospital.
a man of the people, my ass.
when exactly did Dex go to see Boone?
a few hours before he died.
and you never told?
a guy like Dex.
high-profile, respected.
gunned down like a dog.
what do you think they'll do to a guy like me?
they're towing my damn car.
jeez.
where did you find a parking employee with the balls to tow my car?
you've got your people, I've got mine.
let's talk about Dex Collins. - Why would I do that?
because Doherty's wife works admin at a juvenile court.
you had her look into Dex's sealed record, leak it toThe Inquirer.
you can do better than that.
I also have a witness placing you with Dex the night he was murdered.
maybe I should call my lawyers.
well, then we're talking headlines, Grover.
being a suspect in a murder investigation doesn't really help when you're making a run at mayor.
you know, I never knew you to be political, John.
if you'd played ball a few years ago, you'd be head of the department now.
this isn't politics.
everything's politics.
but since I like you, I'm going to give you ten minutes.
ask your questions.
Dex came to you the night he died. He had some photographs.
I was expecting a showdown.
but the boy had a way of surprising you.
you had a tough day in the press.
it's only going to get tougher.
unless... you've come to surrender.
you should probably avoid the Oasis Club.
at least while your wife's in the hospital.
hmm, that's like telling a dog not to bark.
everyone has something.
even you.
let me tell my wife first.
I don't want her to see this in the news.
I'm giving these back to you.
we're wasting time beating each other to a pulp.
and what do you propose?
you kill the newspaper story, I kill the photos, no more smear jobs.
how do I know there aren't more copies?
you don't. So let's be the good guys, Grover.
I absolutely underestimated you.
you know, if the roles were reversed, I wouldn't pay you the courtesy.
I know.
so why are you doing it?
cause I'm gonna beat you anyway.
all my years in politics, I never met anyone like him.
kind of wish he was still around.
it would've made life interesting.
you couldn't last 30 years on the city council without knowing your enemies.
you ever find out who took the photos?
no one in my campaign.
I'm curious, Grover, if Dex had lived, would you have killed the news story?
looks like your ten minutes are up.
we'll do it again real soon.
something kicked up on your suspect from the lineup, Jorge Gomez.
turns out this isn't his first arrest.
I ran his name, no felonies.
but he's got a misdemeanor. Drunk and disorder in '04.
held overnight on $500 bail.
his boss at the time bailed him out.
his boss?
owner of the Diamond Diner.
you're no career criminal, Warren.
if you were, you wouldn't ask three other employees where to buy a gun before Jorge Gomez.
or you'd have thought to toss it in the Schuylkill.
not in a drain pipe half a block from Dex's body.
checked your story for that night.
bartending at the Oasis.
but the manager says you clocked you out early.
alibi's shot; got you with the gun, it's premeditated murder.
you're looking at life.
that gun was for protection.
that's not how you used it.
you know, the thing about the Oasis Club?
that's where those blackmail photos of Boone were taken.
see, what I don't get, why put your neck out for Dex taking those photos, then get a gun to kill h?
that's not how it happened.
you going to have to explain it to us then, Warren.
so we can help you.
give us something for the DA.
do 20 years instead. Get some time with your family at the other end.
I got a right to support a candidate without being harassed.
well, sure, as long as it's Boone.
Yeah, but Boone put the screws to you.
he used everything in his arsenal: the health department, even the cops.
he was out for blood.
he had people watching me.
it's why I got the gun.
sure.
position you were in, hey, I'd have done the same.
all that rage, but why take it out on the wrong guy?
this epic dogfight between him and Boone,
and Dex wouldn't...
what? What happened?
what made you turn?
all that talk about looking in the mirror, seeing faith-- that was powerful stuff.
that's what hooked you onto Dex, right?
so let me ask you, when you look in the mirror now...
what do you see?
I see Dex.
there you are.
Dex, where have you been?
look at this. No dealers. No buyers.
Boone had the cops sweep the block.
today, Sixth Street.
tomorrow, Seventh, the Eighth, the whole district...
what happened with Boone?
I wish I could've seen his face when he got those photos.
it was you?
you're messing with the wrong guy, Warren.
that's why I got this.
anyway, who cares? We are gonna win now!
you didn't use the photos?
we don't have a chance without them.
look, we're in a dead heatight now.
but if we don't pull it out this time, we'll get him next time.
next time is four years from now.
I don't have four weeks!
Boone's taken my restaurant.
I can't pay my bills.
now what's he going to do to me when you lose?
Warren, I guarantee you, he stays away.
you cut a deal.
What'd Boone offer?
clean up your street?
run you in another district?
or was it a straight-up payoff?
no, it's not like that.
I should've known.
you're just like the rest. All crooks!
Sellouts! - Warren, for God's sake...
and I'm the one who gets screwed! - Listen! Listen, man!
Philadelphia August 15, 1989
Father...?
it's time.
don't look back.
where is she? - Isn't she coming back for an encore?
excuse me...
...may we trouble you for assistance?
Speakenzee Englishsky?
Oh... Eh...
I'm sorry. Um...
for my family, please. We ask for your kind help.
may I help you, sir?
you speak Russian?
well, only a little.
my grandpa taught me.
you a Russky too, Vera?
go get 'em, rook.
thank God...
...I don't know if our chaperones followed us...
...what is the protocol?
whoa, sir. I ain't fluent. I got curses and toasts, that's all.
Papa, please.
we surrender our passports.
we want to defect to United States.
the United States.
you speak English... big time.
I learned by watching American television on the black market.
don't tell my father.
you, uh, coming from the prom?
uh...a concert.
this dress belonged to my mother.
Nadia, what are you talking about?
we'll, uh, call the State Department and get someone down here to meet you.
discuss political asylum.
you know, if you do this, there's no going back.
welcome to the United States, little man.
I am sorry.
he only knows police in Russia, where they can't be trusted.
things are different here.
you call me, any time.
I'll help you out.
and, uh, for your, uh, collection.
Philadelphia.
our new home.
I haven't responded to a fight on the highway since I was in uniform.
call came in from the district, someone asking for me by name.
I'll turn that face into scrap metal! - I'll kill you first!
your kind of crowd, Nick.
who's the guy?
do I know you?
Yeah, you said I could call anytime.
I'm Dimitri. - Yeah, Koslov. I remember.
what's going on?
this scum has my sister's bag. - This bag ain't even mine, man!
so where'd you get it, tough guy?
cousin Beamer. Just denied parole. His mama's giving away his stuff.
son of a bitch. - Know whose it is?
who's she?
I was in the Ninth District the night the family defected.
four months later, I was at her funeral.
????
skull fracture, severe bruising, manner of death undetermined.
multiple blunt-force trauma with cardiac arrest, consistent with other wilding victims that night.
serious crime wave in the subways, fall of '89.
packs of kids surrounding their victims, commuters mostly.
I'm 22 years old; I just aced my firearms training;
and my ma's begging me not to take the Broad Street line.
well, your mom wasn't wrong.
the assailants got her bag, but they left her jean jacket, sneakers????
she made some kind of mix tape the day she died.
she was gonna be a big opera star, but she loved pop culture.
toughest funeral I ever went to.
I promised the Koslovs that things wld be different here, but they were worse.
the cousin of the punk we picked up in Center City.
arrested on agg assault charges three months after Nadia's murder.
known ties with the crew who was out wilding the night Nadia died.
lab found residue on her bag.
this clown's DNA shows up, we got a slam-dunk.
what was it about Nadia Koslov's bag caught your eye?
you like the patches, the places your sorry ass will never see, huh, Beamer?
I ain't Beamer no more. I found my Lord and Savior.
I go by Michael now.
tell me what happened that night, I'll start using your grownup name.
it wasn't me who killed her, man.
no? Then how'd you get her bag?
when I found her, she was already half-dead.
Oh, man.
say what?
seeing that girl die like that, all alone...
messed me up real good, man.
nothing else to do but pray.
what's that you heard her say?
is that Russian or something? - I don't know.
but it's stuck in my head to this day.
you see anyone else in the subway?
I only heard the girl falling and footsteps.
what kind of footsteps? - The running kind.
a bunch of Air Jordans up the stairs two at a time?
up the stairs, but they was like clickety-clack, know what I'm sayin'?
hard-soled shoes? - Yeah.
how many?
one person, that's all.
you're saying it wasn't a wilding thing?
as God is my witness. And I ain't got no reason to lie.
Clickety-clack.
come on, Yakov Smirnoff. Tell me you know what it means.
no clue. Like I told you, curses and toasts.
but I know someone who might.
you say you cannot convict man who killed my daughter.
now you say you can?
what I'm saying, Leo, is that we've got a new lead:
Nadia's dying words.
that mean anything to you?
I have no idea why Nadia say this.
sounds like zolotoi. It means "gold," "golden one.
come on, Pop. They're trying to help.
they cannot bring back Nadia.
we have witness testimony. Whoever killed Nadia didn't steal anything.
so why? Drian who kill her?
she knows this person?
what do you remember about the night Nadia died?
pop was driving his usual night shift.
I was upstairs with the babysitter.
anyone come to mind, had a problem with Nadia?
of course. You have been to durdom?
the insane asylum--that's what he called her high school.
Regis High School of the Performing Arts.
Nadia was a voice major.
I thought it was a good school.
pop hated the place.
a lot different than the conservatory back in St. Petersburg.
at Regis there is no study. Only craziness.
you say it is someone she knows.
it is someone there.
my tax dollars paying for this circus? Can hardly hear myself think.
my high school, we were lucky to get a field trip to the dump.
Hey, hey.
Clickety-clack. - Detectives?
I'm Elliot Glick. ght this way.
bear with me.
office hours will start in a few.
cute haircut, Jules. - Back at you, Elliot.
Nadia's death was a tragedy.
she'd only been in the country four months.
you knew her? - Not really.
I was the head of the drama department, and she was a voice major, so, you know, we didn't interact much.
you remember any students or faculty she might have called Zolotoi?
no, that doesn't ring a bell.
we'll need the attendance and disciplinary records from that year.
Nadia's files, yearbook, too.
anything you want.
see you have an all-girl fan club outside.
Nadia a member when she was a student?
I told you we didn't interact much.
what about the night she died?
I was at home with my wife.
we were divorced 15 years ago, but she'll remember. We were...
we were devastated when we got the call.
better luck second time around?
the third time's a charm.
we'll need a list of her teachers.
well, she only had one: Phoebe Curtis???
one teacher?
how's that happen?
Phoebe taught an advanced workshop.
only eight students were accepted, and Nadia was one of them.
I understand you were Nadia Koslov's teacher at Regis.
she was in my improv workshop. I was an alumna, too.
Artist-in-residence. - Class of '77.
voice major, right?
I'm a much better trophy wife than I ever was a singer.
who else was in your workshop?
a couple of kids from each of the departments.
they collaborated in class, and then completed a final project.
this final project...Nadia work with anyone in particular?
Oh, no, it was a solo performance.
they had to improvise on the city streets, and then submit a recording of it for their final grade.
like, on a cassette tape?
or a videotape, something like that.
you still have Nadia's?
she died before completing the course work. I never got to hear it.
when was the last time you saw her?
in my class, the day before she died.
did Nadia ever have any nicknames for you?
not that I know of.
but I'm sure there was some of that behind my back.
I had a reputation for being demanding.
any of her classmates have any problems with her?
Nadia was a world-class soprano.
they were all jealous.
what they didn't realize is that she was struggling just as hard as they were.
Nadia, I'm sorry.
Nadia. I'm gonna have to ask you to stop.
I did something wrong?
I asked you to prepare a piece that expresses who you are.
it is my signature aria. I perform it in concert.
Nadia, I want to hear your voice, your soul, not your technique.
but my father says...
I'm not talking about your father. I'm talking about you, Nadia. Who are you?
not what you think. What you feel.
I...I don't know.
okay.
well, have a seat until you figure it out.
Cyrus, get up there and open up a vein.
Ow!
Nadia, what's the problem?
black roses. I must have an admirer.
maybe I was too hard on her.
you know, those kids were tough enough on themselves.
and each other.
that girl at the door...
she had just lost her spot in my workshop.
to Nadia.
Yes.
what's with the black roses?
they were Chelsea's thing.
she doodled them everywhere. Had a black rose tattoo, the whole nine.
after Nadia died, you give her spot to anyone?
well, since it was available, I gave it to Chelsea.
boss.
what do you got, Kat?
lab ID'd the substance on Nadia's bag.
methyl salicylate.
what is it?
it's a compound found in aspirin and muscle rubs.
this case, in something called oil of wintergreen.
oil of wintergreen? Saying she ingested it?
Yep. Found trace amounts in her blood samples.
lab never tested it back in the day...
cause they thought it was a wilding incident.
trace amounts enough to cause a fatal overdose?
not usually, but Nadia had asthma.
people like her... aspirin compounds can be highly toxic.
would have happened almost immediately.
caused the cardiac arrest. - That's what the ME said.
and get this. Oil of wintergreen's a coagulant.
bruises would have gotten worse after she died.
making it look like she had been beaten.
nothing random about this crime, boss.
Nadia was poisoned.
oil of wintergreen's toxic?
what, like, death by breath mint?
in its concentrated form.
you know, little bro glass dropper bottle.
where did she get the stuff? No poisoning Web sites in '89.
well, any health food store.
lucky for me, not many around back then.
what the hell is it used for?
flavoring in candy, fragrance in muscle rubs and lip balms and, uh, beekeeping.
Beekeeping?
an essential oil for promoting healthy swarms.
so, after tap class, Chelsea Cutler's tending her bees.
I'm working on it, okay? Don't hate...
and why do you keep saying "she"? Could have been a guy, you know?
come on. You know how the ladies love to poison.
better watch what you drink.
sorry. I needed some joe.
no problem.
got her waiting.
So...got any tattoos, Chelsea?
tattoos?
I thought you wanted to ask me about Nadia Koslov.
like answers better than questions around here.
uh, yes, one. A black rose.
black roses.
that your thing back in '89?
Oh, God. What I did to Nadia with the roses.
you think it was me?
took careful planning getting those things in her bag, no one seeing.
cunning and preparation: two key ingredients in homicidal poisoning.
poisoning?
I thought it was a bunch of guys in the subway.
it's a real personal way of killing someone.
you remember who got Nadia's spot in Phoebe's workshop after she died?
please, I did not kill her.
Nadia was stealing your spotlight; you stole it back.
I was angry, and what I did was totally stupid, but once she got into that workshop, she had much bigger problems than me.
how is that?
kids in that class were the best of the best.
they got whatever they wanted.
and somebody wanted Nadia.
career concept: ditch the ethnic last name. Move over, Madonna; hello, Nadia.
Nadia, oh, what can I say?
if you weren't so uptight, you might make my day Cyrus, baby, if ego was a crime You'd be chillin' on death row Doin' time, doin' time.
you are so busted. - Who knew?
she totally gets it.
a dance?
they were attached at the hip after that. Never saw one without the other.
they still dating when Nadia died? - Hot and heavy.
probably wouldn't have thought twice...
till I saw him on a gay bar crawl a couple years ago.
gay?
you just said he was dating a girl.
exactly. The guy was a mess.
couldn't sleep, either?
Yeah. What do you got?
pepperoni.
the books.
opera for Dummies.
I thought my life was complicated.
plots in these things... talk about twists and turns.
anything with Zolotoi?
I looked for Zolotoi, Golden One, Gold... got nothing.
except how many of them have poisonings.
popular way to go in opera.
how about you?
looking in Regis directories, Russian fables.
even e-mailed a professor at the St. Petersburg Conservatory.
shot in the dark.
shot in the dark's better than nothing.
Zolotoi. - Yep, Zolotoi.
you and Nadia close back at Regis?
Absolutely.
I wanted to write musicals for her.
I was the songwriter; she was the voice.
thinking more on the romantic tip.
Oh. Yeah, we fooled around a few times.
I guess you could say I was an equal opportunity crush.
bisexual. - Right.
Yeah, it wasn't until college that I chose my major, so to speak.
you sound like a confused guy, Cyrus.
getting close to Nadia even though you were on a different bus.
maybe it was because she was an outsider.
we just sort of found each other.
you two have any pet names? - No.
but we certainly did adore each other.
I haven't set foot back in the subway since she was...
you know.
ever hear her use the word "Zolotoi"? The Golden One?
no, she only spoke Russian with her family.
with me, she shared the things that she couldn't bring home.
like what? - Her dreams.
where you headed, Miss Thing?
I'm going to talk to Nikki about my final project.
share. Now.
well, the other day, singing with you in the subway...
no, you're going to laugh.
never.
I know it sounds stupid, but that was my voice.
you know, like Phoebe said, I was feeling, not thinking.
I want to be the singer in a band.
a star is born!
Yeah, just don't tell my father. He thinks I'm preparing an opera.
your father's, like, in the KGB.
only way I'm talking to him is if there's a gun to my head.
and Nikki's going to be your backup dancer?
well, I want her help me with choreography.
I mean, if I stand there in my ball gown for another minute like this...
she's probably not the greatest choice, Nadia.
why not? She's the best. - But she's so not a team player.
stop gawking at me.
and get your pet Commie out of here.
Nikki, what are you doing?
warming up for three hours on toe shoes. What does it look like?
an overdose.
but you're good. You're great. You don't need this stuff.
what I need is for you to get the hell out here!
I'm gonna go get some help.
you're gonna be all right... - Bitch, if you get anyone,
I swear to God you'll wish you hadn't.
Nadia consider herself warned?
I don't think so.
that same week, Regis instituted a zero-tolerance drug policy and Nikki was expelled.
well, how'd the prima ballerina take it?
????
you were in Phoebe Curtis's workshop?
sure was. The best of the best.
couldn't find you in the yearbook.
what happened between then and graduation?
Regis wasn't preparing me for the realities of the biz.
so I quit.
you "quit," huh?
so what's this?
looks like "Papers of Expulsion"?
yours. Nadia rats you out for drugs, and you end up here.
so where were you, night she died? Truth this time.
I was too short for a professional corps de ballet.
everyone tried to tell me.
but I wouldn't listen.
I punished myself instead.
nothing an addict likes better than someone else to blame it on.
trust me. My hatred was directed inward.
they had already kicked me out when Nadia found me in my dressing room.
we check with the school, they gonna confirm that story?
I could care less what the Regis faculty say about me.
those losers couldn't do, teach, or keep their hands to themselves.
think of the most painful experience of your life.
boil it down...to one name.
and when you're ready, say it out loud.
shout it, if you have to.
but it's so hard to choose.
I have to go.
you're holding onto something, Nadia.
you've got to let it go.
holding on"?
I left my entire life behind. I have nothing left to hold onto.
except the hurt.
it's come right along with you.
running away is not the same thing as letting go.
I'm trying.
I've seen brilliant performers self-destruct.
if you need my help...
I'll be there for you. Day or night.
okay.
Elliot Glick took a special interest in Nadia?
like a heat-seeking missile.
what was in that little, brown bottle of his?
I don't know. Aromatherapy stuff?
What'd it smell like?
minty.
said you and Nadia "didn't interact much. "Want to revise that statement?
no.
been divorced twice already.
well, I don't see what my marital history has to do with Nadia Koslov.

might give us some insight to the cause of all those breakups.
anything you want to tell beforehand?
I have nothing to hide.

oil of wintergreen.
you know that it was toxic? - I was careful with it.
I used it for meditating.
witnesses saw you applying it to minors, including Nadia.
getting handsy with her afterwards.
I was teaching The Method.
I was helping my students gain an emotional investment in their work.
I gave my soul to those kids.
you were making a pass.
and when she rejected you, you made her pay.
I didn't kill Nadia.
but I didn't protect her, either.
are you all right?
excuse me? - Katya.
the name I would've said if I had courage.
your mother.
come here.
my father didn't let me go to her funeral.
he didn't even let me cry for her.
she was a big deal soprano, so instead of mourning, we practiced.
I'm sorry.
before we left, I wanted to put roses on her grave.
but now I never can.
she would be so proud of you.
I just wish she could hear what I sound like. Not in Russia, now.
well, she can.
go ahead???
and I see your true colors shining through See your true colors That's why I love you So don't be afraid To let them show...
I stop by.
you not at opera. They say you quit.
Mr. Koslov...
Papa! Papa!
hold on! Why are you not working?
I am!
in here, with this podunkum, singing this khrenovyi Amerikansky pop?
my final project is due tonight, and I will do it the way that I want.
there is more to life than opera.
opera is our life.
I am not her, Papa.
this crap school, it ruins us.
us"? There is no us!
just your dreams being shoved down my throat.
a parent should encourage his child's independence.
but Leo took Nadia's growth as a personal betrayal.
he chased her down the hall. That was the last time I saw her.
Hey, Nick, I've got something.
a dean from St. Petersburg Conservatory got back to us.
back in Russia, Leo Koslov was a vocal coach to some big careers, including his wife's.
Katya. - She gave him a nickname and it stuck, at least in opera circles.
the Golden One.
Nadia was saying a name with her last breath.
and it was her father's.

Grandpops, on my ma's side.
MyDeyda. Left Russia and came to this country alone.
he was 14.
wish I could ask him more questions.
listen to more of his stories.
to the wisdom of our elders.
to your grandfather of blessed memory.
never knew about your career in the old country, Leo.
now I do.
with her dying breath, Nadia said your name.
the glory days of your family, your career, your marriage.
why did you lie to me?
I thought I could leave the past behind.
Hamlet. Romeo and Juliet.
the great operas.
stories all had death by poisoning.
is that how you punished Nadia for dishonoring you?
I am one who is punished by fate.
you knew she had asthma.
you knew it would be quick. Did that take the sting out of what you were doing?
you think I did not suffer enough?
Nadia made a tape the day she died. Empty case found at the crime scene.
you have it, Leo?
Nadia had asked me to grieve for all we had lost.
the last time I saw her, she showed me the joy that is possible on the other side of grief.
you know "Va Pensiero?
from an opera by Verdi.
it's a famous song about freedom and also of homesickness.
the tape
it was her final project for the class that I cursed.
she knew you loved her.
but I never got a chance to tell her that.
Elliot Glick's divorce records were a goldmine.
Glick's exes had a lot to say about his extracurricular activities.
he have a history with his students?
Phoebe Curtis. Major player in his second divorce. Ten years on and off.
cornered his second wife in a parking garage with a crowbar.
and that was just her opening act.
would have been threatened by Nadia once Glick had his eyes on her.
well, Glick brought oil of wintergreento Phoebe's apartment for that acting thing.
date on the cassette case is the day Nadia died.
missing tape was her final project.
she might have gone to Phoebe's house to hand it in personally.
Phoebe lived two blocks from the subway where Nadia was found.
get her down here.
want you to think of the most painful experience in your life, boil it down to a name, and say it out loud.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
too hard to say Elliot Glick's name?
Elliot and I were friends.
such good friends you decided to harass his wife.
only thing you forgot was the antifreeze and boiling bunny.
what made you so mad, Phoebe?
you think he was forgetting about you?
he wasn't forgetting about me. I was his muse.
sure, when you still had potential. But you start acting up...
and he creates the artist-in-residence position to keep you close, work a little damage control.
I was a great teacher. I inspired those kids.
till Elliot found his new muse, Nadia Koslov.
then you pull out the oil of wintergreen, and start making your plans.
went back to your old apartment, Pheebs.
stuff's all over the place. Seeped through the linoleum floors.
you're right. I had a plan.
but it wasn't to kill Nadia.
I wanted to kill myself. That was my plan.
but you're sitting right here.
cause it wasn't about Elliot anymore. Not once you heard that tape.
Nadia had found her voice.
she was the real deal.
Elliot knew that. - So didou.
that kind of talent...
made you realize that you never had it.
that hurt. Even more than him not loving me.
until I got the idea that...
...if Nadia was gone...
your problems would be, too.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Phoebe, are you okay?
it's... It's beautiful.
you're the one who taught me to feel.
I felt my mother in my heart, and I sang for her.
Elliot says running away is not the same thing as letting go.
maybe that's why you're sad.
I made this for myself.
it's, uh, good for your throat. You take it.
you're the real singer in this room.
go ahead.
thank you.
come on. Let's get you to the train.
the following story is fictional and does not depict actual person or event. Philadelphia, august 15, 1989.
Carmen

I got curses and toasts, that's all.
Papa, please.

I learned by watching American television on the black market.
don't tell my father.
you, uh, coming from the prom?
a concert.
this dress belonged to my mother.
Nadia, what are you talking about?
we'll, uh, call the State Department and get someone down here to meet you.
discuss political asylum.
you know, if you do this, there's no going back.
Yeah.
welcome to the United States, little man.
I am sorry.
he only knows police in Russia, where they can't be trusted.
things are different here.
you call me, any time.
I'll help you out.
and, uh, for your, uh, collection.
Philadelphia.
our new home.
I haven't responded to a fight on the highway since I was in uniform.
call came in from the district, someone asking for me by name.
I'll turn that face into scrap metal!
I'll kill you first!
your kind of crowd, Nick. - Who's the guy?
do I know you? - Yeah, you said I could call anytime.
I'm Dimitri. - Yeah, Koslov. I remember.
what's going on?
this scum has my sister's bag. - This bag ain't even mine, man!
so where'd you get it, tough guy?
cousin Beamer. Just denied parole.
his ma's giving away his stuff.
son of a bitch. - Know whose it is?
who's she?
I was in the Ninth District the night the family defected.
four months later, I was at her funeral.
skull fracture, severe bruising, manner of death undetermined.
multiple blunt-force trauma with cardiac arrest, consistent with other wilding victims that night.
serious crime wave in the subways, fall of '89.
packs of kids surrounding their victims, commuters mostly.
I'm 22 years old; I just aced my firearms training; and my ma's begging me not to take the Broad Street line.
well, your mom wasn't wrong.
the assailants got her bag, but they left her jean jacket, sneakers.
she made some kind of mix tape the day she died.
she was gonna be a big opera star, but she loved pop culture.
toughest funeral I ever went to.
I promised the Koslovs that things wld be different here, but they were worse.
the cousin of the punk we picked up in Center City.
arrested on agg assault charges three months after Nadia's murder.
known ties with the crew who was out wilding the night Nadia died.
lab found residue on her bag.
this clown's DNA shows up, we got a slam-dunk.
what was it about Nadia Koslov's bag caught your eye?
you like the patches, the places your sorry ass will never see, huh, Beamer?
I ain't Beamer no more.
I found my Lord and Savior.
I go by Michael now.
tell me what happened that night, I'll start using your grownup name.
it wasn't me who killed her, man.
no? Then how'd you get her bag?
when I found her, she was already half-dead.
Oh, man.
say what?
seeing that girl die like that, all alone...
messed me up real good, man.
nothing else to do but pray.
what's that you heard her say?
is that Russian or something? - I don't know.
but it's stuck in my head to this day.
you see anyone else in the subway?
I only heard the girl falling and footsteps.
what kind of footsteps? - The running kind.
a bunch of Air Jordans up the stairs two at a time?
up the stairs, but they was like clickety-clack, know what I'm saying?
hard-soled shoes?
Yeah. - How many?
one person, that's all.
you're saying it wasn't a wilding thing?
as God is my witness. And I ain't got no reason to lie.
Clickety-clack.
come on, Yakov Smirnoff.
tell me you know what it means.
no clue. Like I told you, curses and toasts.
but I know someone who might.
you say you cannot convict man who killed my daughter.
now you say you can?
what I'm saying, Leo, is that we've got a new lead: Nadia's dying words.
that mean anything to you?
I have no idea why Nadia say this.
sounds like zolotoi. It means "gold," "golden one."
come on, Pop. They're trying to help.
they cannot bring back Nadia.
we have witness testimony.
whoever killed Nadia didn't steal anything.
so why? Drian, who kill her?
she knows this person?
what do you remember about the night Nadia died?
pop was driving his usual night shift.
I was upstairs with the babysitter.
anyone come to mind, had a problem with Nadia?
of course. You have been Todurdom?
the insane asylum-- that's what he called her high school.
Regis High School of the Performing Arts.
Nadia was a voice major.
I thought it was a good school.
pop hated the place.
a lot different than the conservatory back in St. Petersburg.
at Regis there is no study. Only craziness.
you say it is someone she knows.
it is someone there.
my tax dollars paying for this circus? Can hardly hear myself think.
my high school, we were lucky to get a field trip to the dump.
Clickety-clack.- Detectives?
I'm Elliot Glick.
get this way. Bear with me.
office hours will start in a few.
cute haircut, Jules. - Back at you, Elliot.
Nadia's death was a tragedy.
she'd only been in the country four months.
you knew her? - Not really.
I was the head of the drama department, and she was a voice major, so, you know, we didn't interact much.
you remember any students or faculty she might have called Zolotoi?
no, that doesn't ring a bell.
we'll need the attendance and disciplinary records from that year.
Nadia's files, yearbook, too. - Anything you want.
see you have an all-girl fan club outside.
Nadia member when she was a student?
I told you we didn't interact much.
what about the night she died?
I was at home with my wife.
we were divorced 15 years ago, but she'll rember. We were...
we were devastated when we got the call.
better luck second time around?
the third time's a charm.
we'll need a list of her teachers.
well, she only had one: Phoebe Curtis.
one teacher? How's that happen?
Phoebe taught an advanced workshop.
only eight students were accepted, and Nadia was one of them.
I understand you were Nadia Koslov's teacher at Regis.
she was in my improv workshop. I was an alumna, too.
Artist-in-residence.- Class of '77. Voice major, right?
I'm a much better trophy wife than I ever was a singer.
who else was in your workshop?
a couple of kids from each of the departments.
they collaborated in class, and then completed a final project.
this final project...Nadia work with anyone in particular?
Oh, no, it was a solo performance.
they had to improvise on the city streets, and then submit a recording of it for their final grade.
like, on a cassette tape? - Or a videotape, something like that.
you still have Nadia's?
she died before completing the course work. I never got to hear it.
when was the last time you saw her?
in my class, the day before she died.
did Nadia ever have any nicknames for you?
not that I know of.
but I'm sure there was some of that behind my back.
I had a reputation for being demanding.
any of her classmates have any problems with her?
Nadia was a world-class soprano.
they were all jealous.
what they didn't realize is that she was struggling just as hard as they were.
Nadia, I'm sorry. Nadia.
I'm gonna have to ask you to stop.
I did something wrong?
I asked you to prepare a piece that expresses whoyouare.
it is my signature aria. I perform it in concert.
Nadia, I want to hear your voice, your soul, not your technique.
but my father says... - I'm not talking about your father.
I'm talking about you, Nadia. Who are you?
not what you think.
what you feel.
I don't know.
okay.
well, have a seat until you figure it out.
Cyrus, get up there and open up a vein.
Nadia, what's the problem?
black roses. I must have an admirer.
maybe I was too hard on her.
you know, those kids were tough enough on themselves.
and each other.
that girl at the door...
Chelsea. Chelsea Cutler.
she had just lost her spot in my workshop.
to Nadia. - Yes.
what's with the black roses? - They were Chelsea's thing.
she doodled them everywhere. Had a black rose tattoo, the whole nine.
after Nadia died, you give her spot to anyone?
well, since it was available, I gave it to Chelsea.
boss.
what do you got, Kat?
lab ID'd the substance on Nadia's bag.
methyl salicylate. - What is it?
it's a compound found in aspirin and muscle rubs.
this case, in something called oil of wintergreen.
oil of wintergreen? Saying she ingested it? - Yep.
found trace amounts in her blood samples.
lab never tested it back in the day...
cause they thought it was a wilding incident.
trace amounts enough to cause a fatal overdose?
not usually, but Nadia had asthma.
people like her...aspirin compounds can be highly toxic.
would have happened almost immediately. - Caused the cardiac arrest.
that's what the ME said.
and get this. Oil of wintergreen's a coagulant.
bruises would have gotten worse after she died.
making it look like she had been beaten.
nothing random about this crime, boss.
Nadia was poisoned.
oil of wintergreen's toxic?
what like, death by breath mint?
in its concentrated form. You know, little bro glass dropper bottle.
where did she get the stuff? No poisoning Web sites in '89.
well, any health food store.
lucky for me, not many around back then.
what the hell is it used for?
flavoring in candy, fragrance in muscle rubs and lip balms and, uh, beekeeping.
Beekeeping?
an essential oil for promoting healthy swarms.
so, after tap class, Chelsea Cutler's tending her bees.
I'm working on it, okay? Don't hate...
and why do you keep saying "she"? Could have been a guy, you know?
come on. You know how the ladies love to poison.
better watch what you drink.
sorry. I need some joe.
no problem.
got her waiting.
so...
got any tattoos, Chelsea? - Tattoos?
I thought you wanted to ask me about Nadia Koslov.
like answers better than questions around here.
uh, yes, one. A black rose. - Black roses.
that your thing back in '89?
Oh, God.
what I did to Nadia with the roses. You think it was me?
took careful planning getting those things in her bag, no one seeing.
cunning and preparation: two key ingredients in homicidal poisoning.
poisoning?
I thought it was a bunch of guys in the subway.
it's a real personal way of killing someone.
you remember who got Nadia's spot in Phoebe's workshop after she died?
please, I did not kill her.
Nadia was stealing your spotlight; you stole it back.
I was angry, and what I did was totally stupid, but once she got into that workshop, she had much bigger problems than me.
Oh, yeah? How is that?
kids in that class were the best of the best.
they got whatever they wanted.
and somebody wanted Nadia.
move over, Madonna; hello, Nadia.
Nadia, oh, what can I say?
if you weren't so uptight, you might make my day Whoo!
Cyrus, baby, if ego was a crime You'd be chillin' on death row Doin' time, doin' time.
you are so busted.
who knew?
she totally gets it.
a dance?
they were attached at the hip after that. Never saw one without the other.
they still dating when Nadia died?
hot and heavy. Probably wouldn't have thought twice...
till I saw him on a gay bar crawl a couple years ago.
gay?
you just said he was dating a girl. - Exactly.
the guy was a mess.
couldn't sleep, either?
Yeah. What do you got?
pepperoni.
the books.
opera for Dummies.
I thoughtmylife was complicated.
plots in these things...talk about twists and turns.
anything with Zolotoi?
I looked for Zolotoi, Golden One, Gold...got nothing.
except how many of them have poisonings.
popular way to go in opera. How about you?
looking in Regis directories, Russian fables.
even e-mailed a professor at the St. Petersburg Conservatory.
shot in the dark.
shot in the dark's better than nothing.
Zolotoi. - Yep, Zolotoi.
you and Nadia close back at Regis?
Absolutely.
I wanted to write musicals for her.
I was the songwriter; she was the voice.
thinking more on the romantic tip.
Yeah, we fooled around a few times.
I guess you could say I was an equal opportunity crush.
bisexual. - Right.
Yeah, it wasn't until college that I chose my major, so to speak.
you sound like a confused guy, Cyrus.
getting close to Nadia even though you were on a different bus.
maybe it was because she was an outsider. We just sort of found each other.
you two have any pet names? - No.
but we certainly did adore each other.
I haven't set foot back in the subway since she was...
you know. - Ever hear her use the word "Zolotoi"?
the Golden One? - No, she only spoke Russian with her family.
with me, she shared the things that she couldn't bring home.
like what? - Her dreams.
- Never.
I know it sounds stupid, but that was my voice.
you know, like Phoebe said, I was feeling, not thinking.
however do you want me I want to be the singer in a band.
a star is born! - Yeah, just don't tell my father.
he thinks I'm preparing an opera.
your father's, like, in the KGB.
only way I'm talking to him is if there's a gun to my head.
and Nikki's going to be your backup dancer?
well, I want her help me with choreography.
I mean, if I stand there in my ball gown for another minute like this...
she's probably not the greatest choice, Nadia.
why not? She's the best.
but she's so not a team player.
stop gawking at me.
and get your pet Commie out of here.
Nikki, what are you doing?
warming up for three hours on toe shoes.
what does it look like? - An overdose.
but you're good.
you're great. You don't need this stuff.
what I need is for you to get the hell out here!
I'm gonna go get some help. You're gonna be all right...
bitch, if you get anyone, I swear to God you'll wish you hadn't.
Nadia consider herself warned?
I don't think so.
that same week, Regis instituted a zero-tolerance drug policy and Nikki was expelled.
well, how'd the prima ballerina take it?
if she had a heart, it would've been broken.
you were in Phoebe Curtis's workshop?
sure was.
the best of the best.
couldn't find you in the yearbook.
what happened between then and graduation?
Regis wasn't preparing me for the realities of the biz.
so I quit. - You "quit," huh?
so what's this?
looks like "Papers of Expulsion"?
yours. Nadia rats you out for drugs, and you end up here.
so where were you, night she died? Truth this time.
I was too short for a professional corps de ballet.
everyone tried to tell me.
but I wouldn't listen.
I punished myself instead.
nothing an addict likes better than someone else to blame it on.
trust me. My hatred was directed inward.
they had already kicked me out when Nadia found me in my dressing room.
we check with the school, they gonna confirm that story?
I could care less what the Regis faculty say about me.
those losers couldn't do teach, or keep their hands to themselves.
think of the most painful experience of your life.
boil it down...
to one name.
and when you're ready, say it out loud.
shout it, if you have to.
but it's so hard to choose.
I have to go.
you're holding onto something, Nadia.
you've got to let it go.
holding on?
I left my entire life behind. I have nothing left to hold onto.
except the hurt.
it's come right along with you.
running away is not the same thing as letting go.
I'm trying.
I've seen brilliant performers self-destruct.
if you need my help...
I'll be there for you.
day or night. - Okay.
Elliot Glick took a special interest in Nadia?
like a heat-seeking missile.
what was in that little, brown bottle of his?
I don't know. Aromatherapy stuff?
What'd it smell like?
minty.
said you and Nadia didn't interact much.
want to revise that statement?
no.
been divorced twice already.
well, I don't see what my marital history has to do with Nadia Koslov.
family court records on their way.
might give us some insight to the cause of all those breakups.
anything you want to tell beforehand?
I have nothing to hide.
delivery invoice from Heart Mart, your old neighborhood health food store.
read the highlighted part.
oil of wintergreen.
you know that it was toxic?
I was careful with it.
I used it for meditating.
witnesses saw you applying it to minors, including Nadia.
getting handsy with her afterwards.
I was teaching The Method.
I was helping my students gain an emotional investment in their work.
I gave my soul to those kids.
you were making a pass.
and when she rejected you, you made her pay.
I didn't kill Nadia.
but I didn't protect her, either.
are you all right?
excuse me? - Katya.
the name I would've said if I had courage.
your mother.
come here.
my father didn't let me go to her funeral.
he didn't even let me cry for her.
she was a big deal soprano, so instead of mourning, we practiced.
I'm sorry.
before we left, I wanted to put roses on her grave.
but now I never can.
she would be so proud of you.
I just wish she could hear what I sound like.
not in Russia, now.
well, she can.
go ahead.
and I see your true colors
shining through See your true colors
that's why I love you So don't be afraid To let them show...
I stop by.
you not at opera.
they say you quit.
Mr. Koslov...
Papa! Papa!
hold on!
why are you not working? - I am!
in here, with this podunkum, singing this khrenovyi Amerikansky pop?
my final project is due tonight, and I will do it the way that I want.
there is more to life than opera.
opera is our life.
I am not her, Papa.
this crap school, it ruins us.
us?
there is no us!
just your dreams being shoved down my throat.
a parent should encourage his child's independence.
but Leo took Nadia's growth as a personal betrayal.
he chased her down the hall.
that was the last time I saw her.
Hey, Nick, I've got something.
a dean from St. Petersburg Conservatory got back to us. - Yeah?
back in Russia, Leo Koslov was a vocal coach to some big careers, including his wife's.
she gave him a nickname and it stuck, at least in opera circles.
the Golden One.
Nadia was saying a name with her last breath.
and it was her father's.
open a bottle of vodka, can't leave the table till it's done.
russian tradition?
Grandpops, on my ma's side.
my Deyda.
left Russia and came to this country alone.
he was 14.
wish I could ask him more questions.
listen to more of his stories.
to the wisdom of our elders, to your grandfather of blessed memory
never knew about your career in the old country, Leo.
now I do.
with her dying breath, Nadia said your name.
the glory days of your family, your career, your marriage.
why did you lie to me?
I thought I could leave the past behind.
Hamlet. Romeo and Juliet.
the great operas. - Stories all had death by poisoning.
is that how you punished Nadia for dishonoring you?
I am one who is punished by fate.
you knew she had asthma.
you knew it would be quick. Did that take the sting out of what you were doing?
you think I did not suffer enough?
Nadia made a tape the day she died.
empty case found at the crime scene.
you have it, Leo?
Nadia had asked me to grieve for all we had lost.
the last time I saw her, she showed me the joy that is possible on the other side of grief.
you know "Va Pensiero"?
from an opera by Verdi.
it's a famous song about freedom and also of homesickness.
the tape.
it was her final project for the class that I cursed.
she knew you loved her.
but I never got a chance to tell her that.
Elliot Glick's divorce records were a goldmine.
Glick's exes had a lot to say about his extracurricular activities.
he have a history with his students?
major player in his second divorce. Ten years on and off.
cornered his second wife in a parking garage with a crowbar.
and that was just her opening act.
would have been threatened by Nadia once Glick had his eyes on her.
well, Glick brought oil of wintergreen to Phoebe's apartment for that acting thing.
date on the cassette case is the day Nadia died.
missing tape was her final project.
she might have gone to Phoebe's house to hand it in personally.
Phoebe lived two blocks from the subway where Nadia was found.
get her down here.
want you to think of the most painful experience in your life, boil it down to a name, and say it out loud.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
too hard to say Elliot Glick's name?
Elliot and I were friends.
such good friends you decided to harass his wife.
only thing you forgot was the antifreeze and boiling bunny.
what made you so mad, Phoebe?
you think he was forgetting about you?
he wasn't forgetting about me. I was his Muse.
sure, when you still had potential.
but you start acting up...
and he creates the artist-in-residence position to keep you close, work a little damage control.
I was a great teacher.
I inspired those kids.
till Elliot found his new Muse, Nadia Koslov.
then you pull out the oil of wintergreen, and start making your plans.
went back to your old apartment, Pheebs.
stuff's all over the place.
seeped through the linoleum floors.
you're right.
I had a plan.
but it wasn't to kill Nadia.
I wanted to kill myself. That was my plan.
but you're sitting right here.
cause it wasn't about Elliot anymore.
not once you heard that tape.
Nadia had found her voice.
she was the real deal.
Elliot knew that. - So did you.
that kind of talent...
made you realize that you never had it.
that hurt. Even more than him not loving me.
until I got the idea that...
...if Nadia was gone...
your problems would be, too.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Phoebe, are you okay?
it's...it's beautiful.
you're the one who taught me to feel.
I felt my mother in my heart, and I sang for her.
Elliot says running away is not the same thing as letting go.
maybe that's why you're sad.
I made this for myself.
it's, uh, good for your throat.
you take it.
you're the real singer in this room.
go ahead.
thank you.
come on. Let's get you to the train.
but then again this isn't a dream. I am just a little kid.
a vile little monster who killed his mother at birth.
do you still resent your father?
not any more.
he's one of those people who believes there's only one answer to every problem one of those who blames everything on Jews and Freemasons.
not seeing you're not going to find one reason but a thousand, to why things went wrong, if they really did go wrong...
I'm cold.
it's warm out.
it's not the weather.
a helluva time for repairs.
but I'm not doing repairs.
want help? -I'm nearly done.
it's for Vanderbruck.
you may be in for a real treat in the morning.
do you hate Vanderbruck?
I don't hate anybody. -I do.
he's here 2 years and already rich.
I can't dirty up these mules.
Huguette'd be sore.
wake up.
no, no...
Vanderbruck's coming.
always a pain in the butt, that one...
quick. This is gonna be fun.
not up yet, Cordier?
hurry up... quick!
I was working late last night.
don't make a habit... Shit!
take a look! Fast!
didn't even say 'good morning'
I don't believe it!
thanks a lot, Cordier.
get these shit holes out of my sight!
forever!
they must vanish. Just as if they'd never existed.
sure thing. Go on...
I don't dare.
excuse me, Mr. Vanderbruck.
that's not funny.
shit, my hat.
kiss me, Huguette. This calls for a celebration!
whoever dares say I sawed the boards so a man'd fall in and maybe get killed.
quit acting like an idiot, Nono
...would be ruining my career...
accusing me of a serious offense and a one contrary to my nature.
everybody knows. I'm not one to take risks.
that's for sure... sissy. You're a prize asshole.
cut it out, blockhead!
you resent Nono because he's a real man.
there, Nono, my little he-man. Lucky I have you.
why not, if it's true?
what's got into you, Lucien?
Oh, Rose, you should've seen the look in his eyes.
like a killer's.
me? Killer's eyes?
eyes don't harm.
hands do.
kiss and make up.
well, kiss him.
come on.
you know, Rose, I've been thinking... But then again...
maybe it's not a good idea - that you get a gun...
to shoot with? -Not to shoot with, Nono.
just to keep her man off if he comes at her with bad intentions.
lt is a good idea! -Not really.
I can't see Rose, so sweet and frail, with a big gun in her little, shaky hand.
and especially 'cause I might unintentionally kill him.
you see.
let's get you a gun. - Really?
sure. Come on.
that's a good one.
a pastor's wife shot her husband with it?
Oh yes!
have anything bigger? Something very, very frightening.
a club?
no, very frightening. - Really, very, very frightening.
a gas mask.
hold it.
good.
I'll never use it. -You never know.
you've got an idea in your head.
not at all, I swear. You know, I do things and I don't know why.
later, I understand. But I never plan ahead.
you're weird sometimes.
you're not scared someday I might shoot you if you leave?
first learn to shoot, then I'll be scared. Go on.
morning. Did we wake you?
you see what I see?
see you later. - Are you following him?
not him. The ladder.
Scram!
never a dull moment when he's around!
are you crazy!
what a sick idiot!
let me by. -This isn't the first time! Should be locked up!
after such a beating, he won't offend again!
you'll be sorry if you touch me.
play along. I'm just pretending.
it's better than being locked up, no?
O. K. But go easy. -Sure.
not the head. - Of course.
take that!
pig! That'll teach you to peep.
easy. He still has to bring home his ladder!
not the head, eh?
I can't read the aviator's book.
it's annoying me. Perhaps it's too well written.
you like sounding illiterate.
you're not... So why?
habit.
grammar gets rusty like everything else if you don't use it. And there isn't a strong demand for it in Africa.
just like for Good and Evil...
what's Good? What's Evil? Nobody knows.
it's not much use here. So that gets rusty, too.
must be the climate.
do you think it will happen to me too?
you will never be like others.
it's not that you're prettier than Rose...
she's my girl, Rose.
no, not prettier, but with you the difference comes from inside.
something that grabs you by the heart like a vice and doesn't let go.
when I look at you...
I'm ill at ease.
but I can't keep away.
do you understand that?
even if we kiss, it won't make it simpler.
Bye. Careful with the pistol. -Don't worry.
stop it, Nono!
and if I pretend too? - lt was that or jail.
leave Nono alone. Rose is waiting for you.
kissing the bitch makes me sick.
I promise I'll try to watch it.
listen.
what is it, sweet? -Why, nothing.
I figured as much.
I'm a bit tired... not enough sleep.
the schoolteacher's cute. -You know her?
not really but I saw her on the movie screen in silhouette.
you both looked fine in silhouette.
you were swell, together.
don't be silly. She's not that kind.
she's too good for you?
while you're the best I can get? -Listen...
having you is an honor...A man who's killed my husband for love.
no, I was just getting rid of trash.
the trash also happened to be your husband, so I killed two birds with one stone.
there's a lot of trash around.
there'll be less and less... Had to start somewhere.
well, I want to believe you killed him on account of me.
let me go on believing it. Who are you to tell me what to believe or not believe?
you're taking your time. - I'm coming.
I don't believe it. They're all conspiring to keep me from sleeping.
I'm worn out...
wait.
what's wrong?
what's with you?
vicious nag...
are you hurt? - lt kicked me in the privates.
come in and let me take a look. -I'll go home.
I'll fix you up. -I'll see a doctor.
you won't get there in this state. - Are you sure?
Yes. Can you walk?
barely.
I don't see any bruises.
but it hurts like hell.
doesn't take much to hurt like hell, when it's down there.
here? Or here?
you're too soft.
I am not soft. Touch me anywhere.
say, you're not crying in pain now.
someone's outside.
hear it?
I'm sure. It's like something was being dragged.
wake up!
I'll go and see.
take your gun at least.
Oh, goddamn!
the son of a bitch is back!
maybe he's not dead.
he's dead as they come.
then he's not alone. -I doubt that.
which goddamn son of a bitch brought him?
there's the bastard.
stop there, damn you!
black bastard. Why'd you bring him back?
please, ma'am. -I'll peel your black ass.
forgive me. -What got into you, for Chrissake?
stop it! How's things, Friday? Getting cloudy, eh?
thank you, Captain, very well. Yes, it looks like rain.
what got into you to bring him back? He was fine where he was.
stop it. -You take the trouble...
to kill him and this prick...
back to the house. Now!
don't be afraid.
I always treated you right.
that's why you can trust me.
I'll never tell a soul. -Good.
I didn't see anything.
you mean like Ma'am Rose naked?
that neither... Can I go, Captain?
sure, Friday. Thank you.
but before you go, give me a hand with burying the body.
white folk aren't meant for vultures.
will he have some?
friday, want some coffee, a piece of bread, some pate?
no, thank you. I'm not hungry.
I'd better be going, now.
wait Lucien.
do you think you'll sleep easy if I let him go, after what he heard you say.
maybe he didn't hear. -You were yelling it.
maybe he didn't understand.
you know I swallow my words. They used to tell me off all the time in school.
well, this time you didn't swallow them. I thought you were tougher.
with Marcaillou you took advantage of the situation.
he was a different story. Friday's a good black, who's never hurt a fly.
if we looked hard enough...
I know what's bothering you.
when it happens
Iike with your husband's 'accident'...
when you hear about it later...you can say:
what can I do? I'm not responsible for it.
but this is not the case this time. This time you know what's gonna happen.
so you're telling me "Don't go.
I can't back out now. Now I must go.
just checking if you've changed your mind.
I'm coming.
you think he'd wait if he'd understood?
tired?
I'm not feeling well, my legs are shaky.
don't worry, it'll pass.
what's wrong?
you know very well I have to do it.
but, Captain, I trusted you. You're different from other white men.
there's your mistake. -I've always believed your every word.
no, you didn't. Now you're lying.
coming from a good catholic like you it worries me.
lying is a sin.
killing people is a sin too. And a worse one than lying.
let me tell you a secret now, and that it might offer you some consolation.
we all kill what we love.
but you don't love me.
and one more thing. No, don't tire yourself getting up now...
better the blind man who pisses out the window...
than the joker who told him it was a urinal.
know who the joker is? It's everybody.
all the bastards who look away when you're in shit, who wallow in their cash, praying through their assholes that nothing happens.
if it's true they were made in God's image,
I wouldn't like to get Him in a dark alley.
you kissed too much white ass. And now you're getting fucked, and you asked for it.
so now this is what I do with friends like you.
did you do it?
I'm tired of taking the rap, for doing what everyone wants me to do, and don't have the courage to do themselves.
madam Marcaillou? -Yes, sir.
Colonel Tramichel - Tra as in tralala...
this early visit may surprise you.
please, gather your courage.
mother of God, no, I don't believe it!
alas, yes, it's but too true.
there must be two. This is the second I'm getting.
when is this story going to be over?
wake up.
there's an officer here to see you.
he says it's urgent.
it's war, for sure.
I don't want you drafted.
but, Huguette if there's a war they'll need the police more than ever to arrest the ones who won't fight.
no, listen.
no?
away! -Let it say goodbye to his master.
it doesn't want to say goodbye. Dogs eat what has scared them, right Medore?
weird dog... He's got a...
I think the victims were struck by the same hand.
the same weapon was used on them both.
I won't say you're wrong, but I won't say you're right.
I know how it happened.
friday wanted to get even with my husband for the beating he got the other day.
so he took the rifle and -see the hole- shot him point blank.
then my husband took the rifle back and killed him before dying.
a case of self-defense. -That's how I see it.
this isn't something unheard of Colonel, two dead men shooting each other.
you're right. It's happened before.
during the war, a machine-gunner got killed.
but his finger stuck in the trigger so his corpse went on and killed dozens of Huns.
my condolences, dear Lady.
make sure they're six feet under. I never want to see them again.
I've never seen a clearer case of murder.
clear as rain water. -You mean still water.
Yes, sir!
kiss me. -You're forgetting again: it's not proper.
you don't grab a brand-new widow.
well, I have to wait for tonight then!
look.
my God... poor little thing.
this whole situation is a real pain!
the dirty pig isn't worth buying a new one.
the veil's a present.
don't fool with death, Nono. It's bad luck.
have more.
then I won't eat after the funeral.
pity though, 'cause this is good food. -It's lamb stew.
need help? -No, that's all right.
quit stuffing your face and look after Rose.
does that really suit me?
you look pretty, dressed up like a widow.
a kiss? -A big one.
come look.
come look. -What's happening?
I saw them. They were kissing.
what are you saying? -Don't interrupt me when I'm speaking.
you're losing it! Why are you making this up?
I saw 'em, I tell you, in the mirror.
shame! -What's going on?
this is the last time I try to comfort somebody.
I just told her to lay her head on my shoulder.
then I patted her on the back, like anybody with a heart would.
you, my only true friend... believing such a horrible lie.
not at all. -Don't listen to those two.
he was feeling up the girl.
stop howling. -I saw them.
shut up!
worst for you, 'cause I saw them. -So?
I'm ashamed. I'm going home.
are you leaving? -After what happened...
she loses her husband, gets insulted...
it's natural she's upset.
you keep out of it. It's woman's business.
come and powder your nose for the funeral.
so, my little Rose... Your heart mourns.
not my heart or anything else.
are you forgetting our Father's words:
forgive us our sins...
as we forgive others.
no, I haven't forgotten, they're lies we teach children and they stick with them, even if they know it isn't the truth.
why should I forgive Marcaillou?
you can only forgive those you love, and even then...
but this isn't something your good Lord teaches.
but you believe in God?
sure. -Do you truly believe?
I believe, but not truly.
Hey, Father. Is that pigeon hanging over the church altar made of gold? -That pigeon is the Holy Spirit.
I'll say no more. I don't want to encourage theft.
what's it worth? Approximately...
what's that? -A walking corpse.
Where's he going? -He's looking for the cemetery.
gonna get buried? -Out of my way, brats.
excuse me. Is Mr. Cordier at the funeral?
that's him over there.
everybody here thinks you're dead!
no, Ma'am, that's not true.
well, I'm glad. You've got a bill to pay at the laundry.
four silk pajamas.
I don't wear pajamas, just nightshirts.
holy Jesus! -What is it?
a ghost. -Where?
there!
it's Le Peron. A ghost has to be dead first.
I didn't think of that.
Warrant-officer George Le Peron.
it's war!
always the war. Why should l be the first to know?
it's not the war.
it's about my brother.
I see the resemblance. -Hardly.
and how is he?
dead...
and you know who killed him.
didn't your regiment squash the peanut picker's revolt?
sure did. -lt sure took guts...
all those blacks armed with clubs and all you had were machine guns!
my brother said you were an ass.
why try to cover up for his murderer. You know very well who's done it.
if I knew who it was, he would already be in jail.
he's a cop, that's why.
is it your friend, Chevasson?
he's not my friend.
I even refused to put him up the night of the crime, which I regret, 'cause if he hadn't been at the brothel...
funny, in trying to defend him, you implicate him even more.
Oh, that's the way I am. I don't know why.
Fete-Nat! Bring the glasses!
don't turn around. He might drop the tray.
you're not afraid of ghosts, are you?
my grandma saw some, long ago.
after the big war, God wouldn't let the dead come out.
there'd be too many.
how'd he do it?
Hello, friend.
so now, white folks wait to be dead to shake the hand of a simple black.
well, it's too late now.
what I just heard is awful!
here it is...
their favorite place.
they were there, so quiet.
What'd they do?
nothing - like anyone else when they can help it.
he always liked ratafia...
this might do something...
it brings me closer to him.
to think that he might've been killed here, my poor brother...
what makes you say that?
well, he had to be killed somewhere.
so, why not here?
true.
I'm exhausted. Walking is tiring...
...but walking and thinking...!
it's funny...
my brother saw you differently.
may I call you Lucien? -Of course, George.
my brother sure had the good life...
better than ours.
you can say that again.
no formalities between us? -It's all right with me.
the army must be a drag at times. -Yeah...
but I couldn't do anything else. And you?
same for me.
but is doing nothing a real goal in life?
not always.
does it excuse us?
can you excuse a pole for filling a hole?
it may squash some rabbits, but is it the pole's fault if it fits that hole?
there's no comparison. A pole is an inanimate object.
aren't we all more or less inanimate?
what do you mean?
who knows!
look. There's a guy who won't die in the war.
sad sight...
not for everybody. Your brother enjoyed shooting them.
and you let him?
I'm not a policeman, George... I'm Jesus Christ in person, sent here with a load of crosses each bigger than the next.
I see...
I try to save the innocent but there aren't any.
all crimes are collective.
we contribute to each other's crimes.
we all shot your brother...
and maybe I did a bit more than anybody else.
strange day!
now what?
a red and a blue sock! I must have dressed in the dark.
I have a question no one has answered yet.
the big question. -Go ahead.
when you scratch your balls, is it 'cause they itch or 'cause it feels good?
I've had an exhausting day.
I get taken for a ghost... I drink ratafia...
I've heard things and I don't even know if I really heard them.
but I don't mind 'cause now I know who killed my brother.
who?
you told me...
I forgot what I told you. Could you repeat it?
what matters is what I didn't tell you.
what didn't you tell me?
your brother and his mate, I saw them alive and well the day after the murder.
no... no... no...
what time is it?
six P. M.
we're entering the virgin forest.
women nurse these fierce invalids returned from the tropics.
how was my mutton stew?
even better than the one Huguette made.
you ate twice!
I can never say no.
why'd you marry her?
I dunno. She asked me.
what about Rose?
same thing.
were you with her when Marcaillou was shot?
let's see... when Marcaillou was shot...
it's strange... we've got so much inside our heads...
but when we want to use it...
nothing!
why do you ask?
it was good for Rose.
even better for Marcaillou! He was a brute.
whoever killed him, did him a favor.
better, a charitable act.
but not everybody can understand that.
I'm not everybody, Lucien.
no, don't.
but why?
don't.
when I pity someone, it's bad for them and me.
why are you so late?
I'm exhausted, Rose.
sleep is all you do.
it's the best thing, besides eating.
when you eat or sleep, you forget about the things you can't solve.
think about it. You'll see I'm right.
it's not thinking I need.
what are you doing?
I'm praying for strength.
you think it'll work?
I'm so weak I couldn't stick my finger in a cherry pie.
it's working! Thank the Good Lord!
it's the least he could do.
God TOLD ME TO KILL THEM. I WASN'T SURE. JESUS CHRIST.
can anyone read that? -No, Ma'am.
it's the beginning of "La Marseillaise."
children of the land the day of glory's come...
...the bloody flag of tyranny's against us...
very good!
the rice pudding's gone!
I had to shape up before taking Rose home.
about time she's gone.
aren't you done yet?
what's taking you so long today? -I'm drinking my coffee.
if you only bothered to look, you'd see it's true.
drink it somewhere else.
you're serving lunch in a bit, so why should I get up now?
O. K, stay there.
I'm off to the hairdresser now and I won't be back for your lunch.
how's she gonna turn up this time?
you spoil my appetite.
what are the odds that war's declared?
you really want it?
Yeah! I waited so long!
but you'll have to fight. -Think so?
they'll put you straight in with the Senegalese fusiliers
but I'm not from Senegal!
and the black units are the shock troops.
highest casualty rate!
Oh yeah?
I guess a war's not so good...
I'll clear out.
but I'd need money. I don't got any.
but I got a friend who does.
a friend?
my sister's husband.
I didn't know he was your friend. -Well, if you weren't...
I'd tell Huguette all about you and Rose.
poor Nono... What supposedly happened is nothing.
absolutely nothing compared to what might happen very soon.
I've lost a button. I'm looking for needle and thread.
found it?
please put it back in order, so Huguette doesn't have to do it, because I won't be here tonight.
and don't look for the money. I've taken it all.
coming! I'm just getting some ice.
last night I dreamt God, had turned into a black, just as Marcaillou was on his way to Heaven.
so that fool didn't even try to get in.
he said "Such rotten luck. I get killed, my wife fucks around, and God's a nigger!
this is the kind of dream you have after eating too much mutton stew.
fakir Birman's horoscope!
look, Pisces, that's my sign.
you will soon make a voyage for romantic reasons.
where'll we go? -That's last year's paper!
so what? The words are still there.
do you think we still have a chance in the next world? You, Huguette, myself, all the blacks full of good will and that counted so little?
my dream made you say that?
maybe.
want to come with me?
where?
to eat fish by the river.
I thought we'd go farther.
you're eating at home. In fact, you're late. My dinner's burning!
sure you won't come?
I'm sure!
too bad!
see you later, darling! -See you!
over there.
I'm worried! He tore my room apart before he left.
I've never seen him like this. He was crazy.
you didn't see him?
I keep telling you he's not here!
of course, he might be in the cupboard.
just 'cause he's not isn't any proof!
you don't know where he went? -Haven't seen him since last night.
since last night!
and that hat there, did it walk in alone?
so you sleep with the creep. It's too disgusting!
and you and Nono?
it's not the same. I love Nono. -Sugar, sugar...
don't change subject! I'll make you spit it out. Where's the dough!
I don't know.
Where's my money?
that money's mine, not his. I saved it up to get the hell out.
I deserve some good times to see the Riviera...
I didn't spend 15 years here to be ripped off by a whore like you. I'm warning you!
I never saw your money!
you seen Nono's hands?
what's wrong with them?
he can get nasty, Nono! One last time, where's my dough?
that's enough! Shut your fucking face...
and if you move, I'll clean the shit outta your brains!
What'd she say? -Don't listen do it!
do what? -Give her one! She'll talk.
don't touch me.
let me go, you bastard!
my money!
mama!
don't let her go!
Colonel!
war's been declared! I heard it on the wireless!
how distressing.
it's just like Daladier to pull a trick like that.
it's typical... I just knew it...
of course... Daladier...
until we get our orders, we'll have to make do.
get out from under my legs.
they're nice but a bit... clinging.
attention!
war has just been declared between France and Germany!
general mobilization!
Lucien, it's awful. Huguette... Nono...
I know, I was there.
you saw everything?
let's say I heard everything. It's the same.
and you did nothing?
why should l? Coffee?
why... to stop me.
it wasn't up to me to stop you.
it was up to you, to Huguette, Nono, Marcaillou.
I might lead you into temptation, but is this a good enough reason not to stop?
I just help people to reveal their real nature.
it's a dirty job, Rose!
and you might very well say I deserve all the dirty pleasure I get out of it.
aren't you ashamed of speaking like this?
that's yet another aspect of my business, enjoying other people's misery.
you've gone completely insane!
no, quite the opposite. I should crack down the rich and powerful but that's just what I'm not allowed to do.
so I make up for it by coming down twice as hard on the poor, the wretched, the blacks.
and poor girls like you who've put their brains where I won't say.
does that make you cry? Don't. It won't help you.
you know, I've sobbed my heart out.
it didn't solve anything.
you can't get out of it so easily.
don't look at me like that! You heard me!
I can't believe it.
Lucien, why did you do it?
I must get out of this situation. You've gotta help me.
I really don't know what to do. - How the hell should I know?
any idiot can see it's your gun and your fingerprints!
but that's horrible!
at first, you're right, it is horrible, but then you start to think about a thousand other different things:
starving kids, girls sold as slaves for a mirror, women whose sex is sewn up...
and you start thinking God created murder out of pure kindness.
cause what is murder compared to all of those horrors?
so, my little Rose, the only thing to do is scram.
but where to?
listen, I'd be glad to lend you the money for the boat.
you'll manage, I'm sure of that.
you could make a mint just doing what you like best.
which, by the way, you do better than any woman I've known.
and being as we'll probably never see each other again,
I'll be glad to have a last quick one with you, even though you're a fugitive.
how am I going to get up in time for mass?
if you so much as touch me, I'll rip your eyes out.
even if I go, don't think you'll get off.
it may take a lifetime, but I'll see you dead.
look at him. That makes him laugh.
it's those two dogs down there.
do you know why dogs sniff each other's butts?
when dogs still ruled the world they held a convention to vote new laws
the head dog said: "l suggest that due to poor hygiene here, our assholes be left at the door.
the dogs agreed and de-assholed.
but just then, a tornado blew in and mixed all the assholes up.
not one dog recognized his own.
ever since, they smell each other's asses and it'll go on 'til the end of time.
funny, isn't it? -Very.
attention! Curfew tonight at 9 o'clock...
stop! There's no more war!
what? -There's no war!
already? -They've signed at Munich.
tonight we celebrate.
Cordier, they've signed at Munich.
he doesn't give a shit, if there's a war or not, can't you see?
don't say that, Rose.
shut up! I've had enough of your bullshit!
I might not be very bright but I did notice you're justifying your every move.
one must always search for the real reason for things, Rose.
you're being a little too harsh, Rose.
and then, doubting my good intentions.
there are times I could swear there isn't a mean bone in my body.
but now I wonder...
they say there's only one death but a hundred ways of dying.
I hope yours will be the worst.
why did you write that on the blackboard?
because I don't love you enough?
you mustn't love me, Anne.
it's not because of you, but my job.
being with you would prevent me from doing it right.
and I can't allow that.
there are thousands of unhappy people, and I'm all alone...
then you shouldn't have told me.
I didn't need to know.
I had to.
you're not afraid?
afraid of what?
of what might happen...
that's not important.
anyway, I've been dead for such a long time.
he who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
the Lord is my shelter and my fortress and my God in whom I trust.
surely he will save me from the fowler's snare, from the deadly pestilence.
detective Pitts. Homicide.
...will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
he is my shelter and my fortress and my God in whom I trust.
surely, He will save me from the fowler's snare and the deadly pestilence.
he shall cover me with his feathers and under his wings.
he shall shelter.
his truth shall be your shield and your buckler.
he who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
the Lord is my shelter.
why are you doing those by hand?
I was just asking myself that.
is that normal?
sending out invitations to a baby's baptism?
is that what Presbyterians do?
well, I want close friends and family there.
how will they know, if we don't tell them?
I'm saying we don't want this turning into another wedding.
our wedding was perfect.
Yeah, 30 of our closest friends.
simple backyard ceremony.
turned into 150 of your mom's closest friends at the church.
Oh, that.
if that's work...
tell them it's your day of rest.
this is Annabeth.
blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely.
Hey. What's up?
sorry to drag you out on a Sunday.
that's okay, Detective.
double time on weekends makes up for a multitude of sins.
what do you got?
married no children.
she's under arrest for killing her husband.
he was regional manager of the Croft Miller's grocery chain.
how'd he die?
well, Mr. Delacroix was stabbed three times in the back with a butcher knife.
Cindy's bloody palm print is on the kitchen counter.
her fingerprints are on the weapon.
has she confessed?
believe she's about to.
she waived her right to an attorney.
not much she can say to get out of this one.
let's see.
we're ready.
Mrs. Delacroix?
the deputy prosecuting attorney is here now.
you ready to make your statement?
Yes.
did you stab your husband?
Yes.
did you intend to kill him?
Yes.
why'd you do it?
God told me to.
blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner.
I think she just found something to say.
I've had dozens of clients who wanted to plead insane, but I don't think I've ever actually had anybody who is insane plead insane.
I'm telling you, this lady is so crazy she doesn't want to plead crazy.
then how can you file a competency motion?
because she doest know about it.
BAILIFF: Case #05CR-30756. People v. Cindy Delacroix.
first degree murder, Your Honor.
judge: I've read the public defender's motion for a pretrial competency exam.
unless the People have any objection to a psychiatric evaluation, I will so order.
requesting a sidebar, Your Honor.
judge: Yes, counselor?
your Honor, this motion was filed confidentially.
Mrs. Delacroix believes psychiatry to be the work of the devil, and objects to even the slightest insinuation she might have mental problems.
then why is he pursuing the competency hearing?
your Honor, this is not a ploy.
Cindy Delacroix believes she was divinely directed to commit the acts she's accused of, and she's not kidding.
well, the State believes she picked that butcher knife up all by herself and stabbed her husband in the back with it three times.
your Honor, if I'm gonna continue to be able to represent my client, I respectfully request the Court to insist on a competency exam over my strenuous objections.
as long as we don't establish the precedent that being deeply religious makes you mentally incompetent, fine.
okay. I get it. Step back.
the Court hereby orders the defendant to submit to a psychiatric examination to determine her fitness to stand trial.
objection, Your Honor! There's nothing to warrant such an examination.
my client considers this examination to be an invasion of her privacy and a direct attempt to circumvent her communication with God.
judge: Competency hearing so ordered.
this is wrong.
this is wrong.
Maureen: Officer Macklin, what's going on?
how are you holding up?
I know there was a lot of fallout after you testified against Detective Martin.
I'm okay. I just want you to know that not every cop hates you, Maureen.
you came down here just to tell me that?
that and I was hoping that you could put this paperwork on the fast track for me.
it's a justifiable homicide.
homeowner takes a gun away from a guy breaking into his house and shoots.
kills him. Burglar had a record for previous B&Es.
hmm, and Officer Keith Macklin has a promotion coming up, and would like another solved case on his record, hmm?
you know, I called you some time ago.
I didn't return the message. Sorry.
that's okay.
you were probably busy.
I was wondering if...
I don't date cops.
Oh, so it's, it's the clothes and not the man?
basically.
listen, I will do this.
anything to save the people's time and money.
but you need to send, uh, Dave Simon up here to talk to me.
I'll bring him myself.
man: So tell me, who is the commander in chief?
and your parent's names?
Gabe and Nora Templeton.
how's the baby?
Oh, she's so cute, it's ridiculous.
she's getting baptized next week.
can you tell me why God told you to kill your husband?
I don't appreciate your tone.
and I'm not going to answer that question.
Mrs. Delacroix,
I simply asked why God told you to kill your husband.
that's between God and me.
I spoke to the Lord.
I sought His guidance.
it was His hand that took Barry's life, not mine.
and I am at peace with that.
so, if God told you right now to reach across this table, put your hands around my neck and strangle me to death, you'd do it?
I know what the Lord guided me to do is against the laws of man, but I answer to a higher law.
okay, she not only knows right from wrong, she just confessed on the record again. She's competent.
and she also just told her shrink she hears voices and believes her actions are compelled by an overwhelming undeniable force.
in Indiana vs. Kennesaw, the Court called that crazy.
you're not listening to me.
you think that everything can be solved through doctors and therapy.
well, there's no question therapy would be a tremendous benefit.
but there is no doubt whatsoever the defendant is mentally competent, aware of her actions and legally fit to stand trial.
so ordered.
your Honor, even though my client is deemed competent to face trial, we reserve the right to plead insanity and/or temporary insanity.
I told you I'm not insane.
this competency finding by no means prevents you from mounting any defense you choose.
if you think you can prove your client was legally insane at the time of the crime...
my sister is not insane! Her husband was insane!
please refrain from talking in the gallery.
if I am insane, then Abraham is insane.
God told him to kill his beloved son.
you promised me you wouldn't say I was insane.
Mrs. Delacroix, I won't warn you again!
God tested Abraham, God tested Jonah,
God tested Sarah,
God tested Mary, and God tested me.
next case.
Maureen: Tell me about the break-in.
the worst part was this was my weekend with Laurie, my little girl.
her mother and me split up last year.
since the break-in, she won't let Laurie stay with me anymore.
did Laurie see anything?
no. Thank God.
she didn't wake up.
like I said,
I woke with a glass-breaking sound, like a window being punched out.
so I got up and I went downstairs.
and I see this guy rifling through my things.
first I froze, but then he spun around.
and I saw the gun and just, you know, instinctively grabbed it.
And?
big struggle.
he wasn't letting go of that gun.
and it just kind of went off.
and he was dead.
well, this is all very consistent with your statement.
you're a very lucky man, Mr. Simon.
I'm lucky everybody's been so helpful and great.
this has been a horrible few days.
but seriously, I appreciate everyone not making it, making it any worse.
thank you both.
thank you.
thank you for coming in.
okay.
so, you good on this?
close.
no one gets a pass until I see the ballistics and fingerprint reports.
I guess I... guess I'll let you get back to work.
ms. Delacroix, you are claiming that God ordered you to kill your husband, is that correct?
God is my shepherd.
he guides my heart and my hand.
and last Sunday, God put a knife in that hand and told you to stab your husband?
Yes.
I can't believe her lawyer let her do this interview.
she fired her lawyer.
you're kidding. She fired Jeff?
she refused any further psych exams and she fired him.
her sister and her church are handling things for now.
and her church thinks a confession on the local news is a good plan?
they're trying to sway public sentiment.
believe me, I almost wish they would've found her incompetent.
gotta tell ya, boss, having to go after this woman's twisted idea of God, that's not a good day in court.
reporter: Why do you think God wanted your husband dead?
the devil had taken his soul.
reporter: So you killed him?
I cut out his sin.
I did as God commanded.
you think a jury's going to go for this? Maybe.
with some people, all you need to do is invoke God and they fall in line.
it only takes one person to deadlock a jury.
well, I don't buy it.
God doesn't tell people to kill.
Danny, do me a favor, and work up a brief on religious based offenses. Okay.
don't let the whole "God told me to do it" spin throw you off your game.
Steve, don't worry.
I'm going to handle this just like every other murder case I've tried.
she's only tried two murder cases.
so she came up from behind and stabbed him.
victim fell forward onto this chair, knocking it on its side.
she stabbed him two more times, leaving the knife buried to its hilt.
this was not a happy housewife.
Anywho... the blood trail goes back into the kitchen, where he grabs his keys.
his car keys?
maybe he thought he could drive himself to the hospital.
staggers outside, face-plants in the yard.
not many signs of chaos and discord in the house.
she said that he was demon-possessed.
but there are no signs of drugs, alcohol or porno magazines.
there's still the computer.
we'll get to that this afternoon.
let's hope there's a big fat Internet history file.
Hey, what about their financials?
big box of receipts.
they did keep track of their money.
good. We need a clear motive based on their life together.
they say women kill men for three reasons:
infidelity, abuse, and, every once in a while, for money.
given that she stabbed him three times, let's focus on the cheating and the beating.
done.
man: Barry and Cindy were the first couple that I married here, back when this church met in a storefront.
they were high school sweethearts.
they had their whole lives in front of them.
so you knew them well.
Yeah.
this is a shock for all of us.
Cindy's one of the most active members of our congregation.
what about Barry?
unfortunately, he had stopped attending.
he was going through some difficult times personally, and he couldn't reconcile his feelings with the tenets of our religion.
were they having marital problems?
they came to me for counseling about a year ago.
they were at a crossroads.
Barry wanted to go one way and Cindy wanted to go another.
it came to a point in therapy where I think Barry wanted me to counsel them to divorce.
he brought it up several times, but Cindy was adamantly opposed.
she did not believe in divorce.
was Barry unfaithful to her?
okay, this is...
I'm still Cindy's active pastor, and the leader of this congregation.
I feel like I've said too much already.
I just need to understand why this happened.
was Barry gay?
again, I don't... I'm not comfortable.
you understand that the clerical privileges only apply to Catholic priests in the confessional.
I can subpoena your testimony.
you have your responsibilities and I have mine.
ANNABETH: We found a dress in Barry Delacroix's closet.
the dress had a name tag on it.
Hi, my name's Marie.
so who's Marie?
exactly.
was he having an affair with Marie, or was he Marie?
well, either way, you got your motive.
it's promising.
how's it going in here?
Cindy's comparing her acts to acts committed in the Bible.
but, in the Bible, if God wants somebody dead,
he takes care of it Himself.
lot's wife, Sodom and Gomorrah...
okay, so God never tells anyone to kill.
if He does, it's just a test.
and then He stops the guy from doing it.
I have a feeling this act has a lot less to do with God, and a lot more to do with Marie.
I'm on my way to talk to the victim's brother.
keep it up.
I'm so sorry for your loss, but I have to ask
did your brother ever talk to you about someone named Marie?
Marie? No.
do you know if he was having an affair?
that's not a simple question.
he and Cindy had known each other since they were, I don't know, a couple of dumb kids.
he had grown into a different person;
she wanted him to stay the way he was.
are we talking about sex?
Yeah.
he wanted to try different things, but he didn't want to upset Cindy.
that's what he kept saying to me.
he was trying to figure out how do that without hurting her.
but, finally, he realized he had to leave.
he told you that? When?
a week or so before he died.
did Cindy know that?
of course!
Oh, Barry was very honest with her.
he wanted to do this right.
but it just...
all went wrong.
so about a year ago, the Delacroixs upgraded their computer system, and Barry discovered the wonders of pornography.
guy just went bananas.
two grand a month on their credit cards.
he only made $45, 000 a year.
wait, it gets better.
look where he's been spending most of his Internet time last couple of months.
"free Living," what is this?
it's like a swingers organization.
you mean like wife swapping?
more like just group sex.
I've been trying to get in touch with some of these people, but they're kind of hard to track down.
Sex-addicted swinger and a religious wife.
that's a recipe for disaster.
and a slam-dunk motive, if we can get somebody from "Free Living" to testify to Barry's involvement.
keep looking.
you got it.
on your B & E case.
thank you.
Maureen: Do you understand you have the right to counsel?
I've got nothing to hide.
the burglar pulled a gun and we struggled.
your fingerprints are on the bullets.
you lied to me, Mr. Simon.
it was your gun.
that's... that's not possible.
I'm going to give you exactly one more chance to tell the truth.
okay.
it was my gun.
but it wasn't my idea to lie about it.
whose idea was it then?
the officer.
gosh, you know,
I don't want to cause trouble for anybody.
what did Macklin tell you?
okay, the gun wasn't registered.
so when I told Macklin that, he said I should say it was the burglar's gun.
he said it would save him, me, everybody, a whole lot of trouble.
He'd...he'd just write it up that way.
his fingerprints are on the bullets.
wait a minute, are you saying that it was his gun?
he says you told him to lie about it.
you think I filed a false report?
I'm informing you of what he said.
you know, a lot of guys said some pretty nasty things about you after you testified against Detective Margate.
I wasn't one of them.
this is why I don't date cops.
if Dave Simon said I told him to lie about that gun, then he's making that up, and if he's making that up, he's making up everything else.
two things: Cindy Delacroix purchased a set of kitchen knives six days before the murder.
I have a credit card receipt to prove that.
do we know if the murder weapon came from those knives?
I'll have Forensics check.
great. What's the second thing?
Cindy got a new lawyer.
somebody named Marla Dodds.
no.
Oh, no, no, no.
who is she?
she's a nightmare of a defense attorney, and an unapologetic media hound.
that would make sense.
Why?
cause she's outside on the courthouse steps right now.
religion is under attack in this country, in our schools and in our courthouses
in this very courthouse where our sister, Cindy Delacroix, will be tried.
is this just?
is it fair?
no. Why?
because how can a godless process ever understand the heart of a God-fearing woman?
let us all bow our heads and join in a silent vigil for our sister Cindy.
and let us pray that the Holy Spirit will touch the heart of this judge, this jury, this prosecuting attorney, so that they, too, may one day be able to hear the voice of God.
she's praying the jury ignores the law?
she's saying religious people should band together, regardless of the cause.
she's manipulating emotions.
she's going for jury nullification.
so what does that mean for us?
it means I have the strongest murder case.
I could possibly have...and I could lose.
no luck finding our swingers or the mysterious Marie?
nothing so far.
detective Pitts is still on it.
well...
show time.
ms. Chase...
it is an honor to do battle with such a seasoned star of Indiana's criminal justice system.
ms. Dodds.
you know what Jesus said at the Last Supper:
everybody who wants in the picture, get on my side of the table.
Maureen: What you told us is not adding up.
did you know the man you shot was a loan shark?
Really? No.
I have a sworn statement from your ex-wife saying she left you because of your gambling addiction.
that's her side of the story.
Ernie Hay came to your house on the evening of September 8, and you let him in.
and he demanded that you pay him what you owed him.
this record book from Ernie's apartment has you in the red for 150 grand in football bets.
when you told him you couldn't pay him, he threatened you, so you got your gun out and shot him.
come on.
you... you know that's not the way it was.
then you broke the window to make it loo like a burglary;
got his fingerprints on the gun to make it look like it was his, to make it look like self-defense.
it was self-defense.
except there was no break-in and he never had a gun.
and I never told you to say that the gun was his.
I want to talk to a lawyer.
the right shoulder blade;
the second stab wound punctured the victim's left lung and the third one went very deep, causing massive internal bleeding.
how would you categorize such wounds?
these would be classified as rage wounds.
ANNABETH: Thank you.
no questions, Your Honor.
ANNABETH: Detective Welsh, can you tell us if any of these knives were used in the commission of the crime?
the largest one, the chef's knife, was found imbedded in the victim's back.
ANNABETH: The one with the defendant's fingerprints on it?
that's correct.
nothing further, Your Honor.
thank you for your good work, Detective.
no questions, Your Honor.
ANNABETH: Pastor Rayburn, does God speak to you?
Absolutely.
in what way?
I sense Him in my heart, in my soul.
in every way possible.
does God condone killing?
no. Of course not.
ANNABETH: Thank you, Pastor.
no further questions, Your Honor.
pastor...
what does the Bible say that God did to Sodom and Gomorrah for their sins of the flesh?
he destroyed them.
objection, Your Honor.
the reference...
your Honor, Ms. Chase is the one who opened the door to this line of questioning when she asked the witness if God condoned killing.
actually, I'm objecting to the reference to Sodom and Gomorrah, in which God did not ask an individual to do the destruction, He did it Himself.
and if the Court wishes to get into biblical debates, we'll be here indefinitely.
stay on target, Dr. Dodds.
pastor,
the last time that Cindy came to you for help, what was going on in her life?
she was struggling to save her marriage.
struggling against what?
her husband's sexual obsessions.
Mm! Could you be more specific?
he... he wanted Cindy to have sex with multiple partners.
and what did Cindy want?
a family.
a normal marriage.
DODDS: So, when Cindy asked for your help, what... what sort of advice did you give her?
I said the Bible teaches us to hold marriage sacred, but in this case, her marriage may not be a real marriage anymore, but a perversion of marriage.
Oh, so... did you offer a remedy?
I told her to open her heart.
that God would tell her what to do.
I think we made a big mistake not arguing religion.
how'd it go?
she's turned into St. Cindy in there.
we should call the pastor again for tomorrow.
guys... Steve, this is how she does it.
this is how she wins.
she puts the focus of the debate as far away from the crime as possible, and gets you to follow her.
guys, good news.
I found the swingers; they want to talk.
let's not keep them waiting.
we've just been in a state of utter confusion, Phil and me.
we couldn't believe that Barry was dead.
it's just so awful.
when we heard all the horrible things they were saying about Barry on TV, particularly because he was involved in "Free Living,"
we knew we had to speak out.
well, you did the right thing.
Yes, and we are interested in anything you have to tell us.
well, first of all, Barry was a good man.
a sweetheart.
he did not deserve to die like that.
and second, that woman, keeps calling herself Cindy, his wife...she's a hypocrite.
you knew Cindy?
Yeah. We knew her.
as Marie.
we've been getting the victim's mail since the murder, and that bill just came in.
Barry reserved a moving truck.
picking it up the day he died.
somebody up there likes you.
defense get a hold of that yet?
Yeah, they just got it this morning.
well, they're going to claim
Cindy didn't know anything about it.
with Marla as her attorney,
I have to get Cindy on the stand.
Dodds won't let that happen in a million years.
Cindy's a woman scorned.
I have to find a way to let the jury see that.
let the evidence show them.
that's just it-- Dodds has a way of making evidence irrelevant.
I have to provoke Cindy to testify.
was Barry alone when he came to the Free Living sex parties here in Indianapolis?
first of all, they're not parties, or orgies.
they're sexual exploration seminars.
the witness will answer the question.
ANNABETH: Did Barry come to these sexual seminars alone?
no.
who did he come with?
he came with his girlfriend, Marie.
is Marie here today?
Yes.
would you point her out to us, please?
she's lying.
DODDS: Objection, Your Honor.
this is an unsubstantiated allegation.
your Honor...
this dress with a name tag that reads in full
free Living Seminar
Hi, my name is Marie,
was found in the Delacroix's bedroom.
DODDS: In Barry Delacroix's closet, not Cindy's.
ANNABETH: Your Honor, we are checking DNA from the dress against DNA taken from the defendant.
but, if need be, the witness can identify certain birthmarks on the defendant's body.
withdrawn.
what happened when you first met Cindy?
she was real nervous, so I got her a drink and we just talked.
she enjoys drinking White Russians and so do I.
so I told her, they don't have to be fattening if you make them with skim milk.
and then what happened?
she met my husband Phil, and we danced a little bit, and, eventually, we hooked up with Barry.
and then with a couple of other couples, and, you know, had sex.
who had sex?
we all had sex.
together.
did you have sexual relations with Cindy Delacroix at this seminar?
Yes.
two different times.
this is wrong.
was she a willing participant?
I would say so.
based on...?
based on she was very giving.
and she certainly seemed satisfied.
she cannot say this about me.
take your seat, Mrs. Delacroix.
she also came back to three different seminars.
she is lying!
no, let go of me!
this woman is lying, and I demand to be heard!
this is my trial.
judge: Order! The defendant will be silent.
counselors, approach the bench now.
there is nothing more fundamental then the right of the accused to speak in her own defense.
what about the rights against self-incrimination?
she's on the record as saying she wishes to testify, Dr. Dodds.
has she expressed this wish to your privately as well?
she has, Your Honor.
then that is her right.
we'd been married for 12 years, and our sex life had always been normal.
but then Barry started telling me how repressed he felt.
that he enjoyed other things.
I know this is difficult, Cindy, but you need to be more specific.
the Lord wanted me to do whatever it took to save my marriage.
even sleeping with other people?
it wasn't easy.
or pleasurable.
I didn't enjoy anything, like that woman said, but Barry wanted to experiment.
and did you want to experiment?
I didn't want to lose my husband.
love, honor and obey your husband.
those may be words to some people, but to me, they're not.
and I loved him so much, I lowered myself.
it was sickening.
so, I prayed for guidance.
I asked the Lord to protect me.
and He answered me.
how?
a voice.
God spoke to me.
he said he was with me, but that I needed to protect myself.
he told me to pick up the knife.
he told me He would guide my hand.
and that's the last thing I remember.
ANNABETH: So, it's your testimony that you had sex with Cheryl Pierson, but you did not enjoy it?
I did not.
you did not enjoy it twice?
objection, Your Honor. Withdrawn.
ANNABETH: Did Barry force you to have sex with other people?
did he hurt you or threaten you?
I knew it was what he wanted.
but did he physically force you?
no.
did he threaten you in any way?
no.
did things improve between you and Barry after you had sex with other people?
no, they did not.
in fact, Barry reserved a rental moving truck six days before the murder.
isn't that true?
I'm not sure.
it must have been awful for you to have lowered yourself like that.
sacrificed your standards, your morals, your own body.
I prayed that he would see the error of his ways.
because God gives us free will.
that's right.
did God tell you to go to those sex parties, or did you choose that of your own free will?
I did it to save my marriage.
but you chose to stay in that marriage.
Barry wanted a divorce.
he wanted out.
he told you he intended to have sex with other people, but you chose to stay.
I loved him.
love is a powerful thing, Mrs. Delacroix, but so is rage.
so is shame.
like the shame you felt when you attended sex party after sex party, debased yourself with another woman, and Barry told you he was moving out, anyway.
and the rage you felt when you picked up that knife and, of your own free will, stabbed him in the back.
no. You wanted revenge.
you wanted him to pay, you wanted him to hurt the way you were hurting.
I just didn't want him to leave me!
how great was that?
if this were any other trial,
I'd say you made your case, but whatever you did, Dodds has suceeded in making God the defendant.
there are one or two jurors just lapping up everything she says.
you're gonna have to get through to them.
it all comes down to the closing argument.
you're gonna have to make a better sermon than she does.
God is real,
and God speaks to us all, but most of us chose to ignore him, because most of us don't want to hear His word, because, if we did,
we might be called upon to act.
to sacrifice.
I'm sure that...
that many of you have a personal relationship with God, but you are also under attack, because, in this country, if a person says that God speaks to them, not in an intellectual or metaphorical way, but actually, actually speaks to them, that person will be vilified.
Barry Delacroix was a lost man.
he lost his faith.
he chose to live a life of perversity and depravity, and he wanted and expected his wife to do the same.
he wanted his wife to have homosexual experiences for his entertainment.
he wanted to offer her body to other men for their sexual gratification.
now, you tell me who has committed the crime here?
this man, or this woman who has listened to the never-changing voice of a moral God?
does the prosecution wish to rebut?
I'm not here to debate whether Cindy Delacroix is a woman of faith.
I don't know if God has provided her comfort and guidance throughout her life.
I hope He has.
I'm here to see is held responsible for the act she committed.
her husband Barry had some strange ideas, I'll give you that, but he never forced her to do anything.
he tried to extricate himself from the marriage, so they could both lead the lives they wanted, but instead, Cindy chose to attend numerous sex parties with him, where she chose to have sex with other people.
when Barry decided to leave, anyway,
Cindy chose to take matters into her own hands.
she chose a particular knife, and when her husband was about to walk out the door forever, she chose to bury that knife in his back, not once, not twice, three times.
Cindy Delacroix is not a saint.
she is a murderer.
members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
we have, Your Honor.
what say you?
jury FOREMAN: On the sole count of murder, we the jury find the defendant, Cindy Delacroix guilty.
judge: Bailiffs, take charge of the defendant.
members of the jury, this completes your service.
you are dismissed with the thanks of the Court.
we are adjourned.
music's weird.
it calms me down.
you're smoking meth, and you want to calm down?
I'll be right back.
got to go do something.
yes?
drive! Drive!
look out, look out, look out!
crap! My mom's gonna kill me.
dude, what did you just do?
I took a leak.
Oh, sweet!
I'm gonna take you on a trip Follow me...
honey?
Hey, hon?
who discovered the bodies?
came home from a business trip to find his wife and mother-in-law shot dead, point-blank range.
ballistics matched. 380 caliber, probably a pistol.
cheap, concealable, quiet.
Yeah. They were killed in the living room.
TV was still on.
what are you thinking - home invasion, robbery, drugs?
well, they're all on the menu, but never can tell.
leads on the shooter?
uh, there's one unidentified fingerprint on the wife's wedding ring and a few others we're still working on.
and the husband was where when this happened?
away on business, Chicago.
how long? - Just one night.
he's in financial services.
any chance the husband might have...
hired somebody to kill his wife and mother-in-law while he was conveniently out of town with an iron-clad alibi?
I was gonna ask if you had any thoughts on who the shooter might be.
no. This guy is in shock.
um, let's see. Mr. Prichard checked out of his hotel 11: 15 a. m. on Wednesday.
flew back to Indianapolis that afternoon.
M. E. thinks the shootings went down Tuesday night.
what a horror show, coming home and finding your family killed for no reason.
do me a favor.
let's keep the press at bay on this.
we don't need a media circus until we have somebody in custody.
and Annabeth?
get ready to catch this one when it lands.
I remember hearing a car racing down the street, but I had no idea it hit my car.
anyway, before bed, I let the pupper out, and that's when I noticed this mess.
what's strange, I didn't hear the shots, but I heard a car.
Yeah, well, shots were fired indoors.
it came from a small caliber weapon.
it's quieter than you think.
when did you hear the vehicle racing down the street?
I was watching one of my shows.
maybe 8: 00, 9:00 p. m.
so, how well were you acquainted with the Prichards?
she was a very kind lady.
it's just so terrible.
it really just makes you scared.
you think things like this won't happen in your own backyard.
well, did you hear anything, see anything?
when I got up in the morning,
I noticed all their lights were still on.
I- I thought it was odd, but I thought they just forgot.
this mirror is from the right side of a 1995 Chevy Tahoe.
and from the paint scrapings, this particular SUV is dark blue metallic.
Thanks.
check body shops, uh, local insurance agents.
we're looking for a 1995 dark blue Chevy Tahoe, a scrape on the right side, missing the passenger-side mirror.
I'm so surprised the police are investigating this.
we just called our insurance guy yesterday.
can you tell me what happened?
my son Charles went to marching band practice, and somebody banged it up in the high school parking lot.
may I speak with Charles?
sure. Come on in.
lately, he's been practicing a couple of hours a day.
Chuckie, what on earth are you doing?
What...?
Chuckie, get back in here!
get off of me.
this is Detective Drummer.
I need a black and white sent to 338 Rosewood Avenue.
I'm very sorry for what happened Tuesday night.
I didn't know anything about the murder beforehand.
I thought we were just out smoking meth.
we? Who's we?
Chuckie wants to fully cooperate.
he feels genuine remorse.
he's confessed to being there.
he admits to doing drugs, and he's perfectly willing to tell you the name of the other guy.
the guy with the gun.
I'm waiting.
we're looking for probation.
right now, you're our prime suspect.
you've admitted to fleeing the scene of a double homicide.
you're old enough to be tried as an adult.
but I didn't kill anybody.
I didn't even go in the house.
you have any idea why your friend shot two women in cold blood?
he's not my friend.
then what was he doing in your car?
he was my dealer.
we were driving around getting high.
he-he just told me to pull over.
I stayed in the car the whole time.
I had no idea what was gonna happen.
then I heard the shots, and I drove him away, but that's-that's all I did.
you drove a getaway car in a murder.
that makes you just as culpable as the person who allegedly committed the crime.
if he knew a crime was being committed, which he did not.
he just told me he heard the shots.
at the very least that's aiding and abetting.
listen, this is all about who the other guy is, and you're not gonna get to him without making a deal.
my son has a drug problem, but he didn't rob anybody, and he certainly isn't a killer.
he goes to church.
he plays in the marching band.
we're not the kind of people who do things like this.
he's a scared kid who made a mistake.
he fled the scene.
he drove the getaway car.
he's doing time.
how much time?
one year in prison, five years felony probation, mandatory drug rehab.
I want a guarantee.
two women are dead.
so I'll tell you what.
if he's lying, if he doesn't lead us to the killer, if his testimony falls apart, he's doing 12 years, guaranteed.

does TJ deal meth out of the apartment?
I don't know.
I always just called him up.
there he is.
that's him. That's TJ, the guy.
yeah?
detective Drummer.
is he armed?
what do you... what do you mean?
does he have a gun?
he used to. I don't... I don't know.
stay there.
Chuckie led us to the shooter who had stolen goods in his possession which he'd taken from the home of Julie Prichard, one of the two women he murdered.
so, this Chuckie will testify that he saw TJ go into the house, that he heard shots fired, and that TJ ran from the house with stolen property?
exactly.
Chuckie's passed a lie detector test.
I think he's for real.
he's-he's a 16-year-old kid.
he got in over his head.
and TJ? - TJ's 20.
is there any other evidence to tie this TJ character directly to the crime scene?
the prints we found in the house and the partial print we found on Julie's wedding band turned out to be TJ's.
apparently, he tried to pry it off her finger after killing her.
that's as cold-blooded as it gets.
junkies will take anything.
okay, so, walk us through Chuckie's deal.
his lawyer wanted him to walk but I got one year in jail, and five years felony probation.
sounds about right.
any lead on the murder weapon, Lou?
we're searching for it now.
Chuckie claims that TJ threw the gun out of the car window the night of the murders.
and Chuckie's gonna lead us to where it got tossed.
he threw the murder weapon out the window?
guy's a meth addict.
he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
okay. So, it looks like Mr. Terrence Jerome Mills is on the hook for two counts of murder and armed robbery.
let's schedule an arraignment, and find TJ's murder weapon.
Maureen, I want you to talk to TJ's public defender.
let's see if the boy wonder has anything to say for himself.
and Annabeth, I want you to get a deposition from the victim's husband.
there's no evidence that he was involved here, but let me know if you feel like there's something important we're missing here.
detective, we've got sth right there
Chuckie said you pulled the trigger.
you don't have to respond to that.
I can respond to it.
Chuckie's lying, okay?
he killed those ladies, not me.
we were driving around getting high, you know, and Chuckie said,"Let's get some money."
let's do these people.
then he just shot them both.
boom, boom.
it was sickening.
any reason?
just for the fun of it?
Yeah.
Chuckie's a jackass.
TJ, his fingerprints aren't all over that house, but yours are.
Yeah, because he was wearing gloves.
the police found the murder weapon a. 380-caliber pistol.
it's a straight-up ballistics match from the killings.
that's not my gun. - Really?
then why are your fingerprints all over it?
you don't have to answer that.
I'm not gonna.
our office is willing to take the death penalty off the table if you will plead guilty.
let's get real, Maureen.
you know the death penalty isn't on the table in the first place.
there are no special circumstances.
the case is completely circumstantial, and your star witness is a drug addict.
the worst possible case scenario,
TJ gets life without parole.
Yeah, well, that's more than he gave those two women.
we're offering nothing less.
since that's what he's going to get from a jury, if he gets convicted, might as well roll the dice and see if he gets off.
Yeah, well, let me know how that works out for you.
Oh, Mr. Prichard.
I'm Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Chase.
I'm, uh, I'm so sorry for your loss.
thank you.
please, have a seat.
I know this is a difficult time, but I do have some progress to report.
it looks like we may have found the man who murdered your wife and mother-in-law.
who is it?
does this man look familiar to you?
no. - Take your time.
maybe your wife knew him?
no. I'm sorry.
what about the other kid, the, uh, driver?
he led us to the shooter and is testifying against him in exchange for a reduced sentence.
how reduced?
one year in jail, five years probation.
that's all he gets, for killing my wife?
we believe he only drove the car and had no prior knowledge of the murder.
and that he could not have stopped it.
he didn't even try to report it.
maybe if he had called 911.
we need Chuckie's testimony to put your wife's killer away.
otherwise we never would have made the deal.
promise me this is the guy.
promise me he's not going to get off easy, too.
I promise.
if he's the guy, he won't get off easy.
he'll be charged with both murders.
I'm just curious.
does your work take you out of town often?
no.
but this was the Midwest Mortgage Lenders Association's annual conference.
it happens once a year.
I used to like to go on the thing, you know, hanging out with the guys.
but ever since I married Julie, I can't wait to get home.
I just get so lonely without her.
she doesn't like to be alone, either.
that's why her mom was with her at the house.
we kept talking about getting a dog, but I figured I'd be the one stuck walking the damn thing every day.
damn it.
I just keep thinking, if I'd only been there, you know?
if I'd...
who asked for this meeting, us or them?
his PD, a career-climber.
I think she staging a dog-and-pony act to impress her supervisor.
she knows TJ's guilty as sin, but she's got to act like she's fighting for him.
I'm thinking she'll ask for 30 years.
and we'll counter with two terms of 60 consecutive?
exactly.
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.
Oh, man, all right, tell them. Tell them.
sit down, TJ.
you brought us down here to watch your client go through withdrawal?
I come bearing gifts.
just get to it, Becky.
hypothetically, if TJ were to confess to killing Julie Prichard and her mother on the night of December 6, and if he were to tell you that someone hired him to commit these murders...
you're claiming this was an execution?
this was not a random home invasion.
this was a murder for hire.
and you can prove that by...?
in exchange for giving you the man who ordered these executions,
TJ will serve 15 years.
or we'll investigate and find him ourselves.
you'll never get near him without me.
he's one of the biggest amphetamine suppliers in the Midwest.
if you could get him, you would have done so a long time ago.
you murdered two women in the course of an armed robbery.
we're not interested in a deal unless you're giving up Osama bin Laden.
well, then, we're in luck.
how does Richard Wolf sound?
richard Wolf hired you to murder these women?
I'm a dealer. He's my supplier.
why did he want these people killed?
I don't know why.
something to do with a business deal gone bad.
he was going to give me a six-month supply.
Ooh, well, that worked out well.
the name doesn't mean anything unless he can prove Wolf ordered the hit.
we're not just going to assume he's telling the truth.
it's all true!
I swear to God.
I can't spend my life in prison.
look, I'll wear a wire.
I'll get him to talk.
I'll get him to say that he told me to kill those two people.
how do we know you can even get near him?
because I just killed some people for him!
we have a relationship.
he's expecting me to show up so I can get my payment.
richard Wolf is going to find out you've arrested TJ anytime now.
let's make this deal and TJ can lead you to Wolf before that happens.
we'll get back to you
we can't take this deal.
Oh, we're taking the deal, Annabeth.
are you kidding me?
15 years for a double homicide?
are you kidding me?
richard Wolf is the Moby Dick of meth.
he is the whale.
the DA starts salivating at the mention of his name.
it's still a bad deal.
if we get Richard Wolf, we could lose every drug case we have on the docket for the next year and still be ahead of the game.
wolf is responsible for a third of the meth production in greater Indianapolis.
meth is tied to 20% of the murders, and one in four of the fires in this city.
what am I supposed to say to the victim's husband?
15 years is not a slap on the wrist, Annabeth.
not in exchange for taking a drug lord off the streets.
you've got to think big here.
wait, we have another problem.
if Wolf ordered the hit, what did James Prichard do to cross him?
what was Prichard's line of work again?
financial services, mortgage, lending, that sort of thing.
he could have been laundering Wolf's money, hiding it in real estate.
of course it wouldn't hurt to confront James Prichard directly and see how he responds to Wolf's name.
you think you can handle that?
it's hard to believe Prichard's involved in meth.
he's such a straight arrow.
but if he is, then we don't have to take TJ's deal.
I just... I don't want to give 15 years to this cold-blooded killer.
there has to be another way to get Wolf.
how do we know TJ's even telling the truth?
I mean, how do we know he even knows Richard Wolf?
we do need to corroborate TJ's connection to Wolf.
but we've got to do it quickly.
the minute we arraign TJ,
wolf's gonna hear about it, and then we can't send TJ in with the wire.
meantime, let's look into Prichard's business.
if he was working with Wolf, he must have done something to make him very, very angry.
your boyfriend's in a lot of trouble.
I'm going to need you to give me the names of some of the people he hangs out with.
how's that supposed to help TJ?
it could help him spend less time in prison.
what makes you think I want him out of prison?
he, uh, listed you as an emergency contact.
he did?
he's not the most reliable individual, he stole stuff all the time.
like what?
money, mostly, and...
drugs?
he ever mention any names?
I don't know.
no, I don't know. Why?
I'm coming.
I said I'm coming.
I've got to go.
TJ ever borrow your cell phone?
Yeah, he stole it for, like, a month.
guess who had to pay the bills?
yeah?
what's your cell phone number?
homeowner's Refinance Bank "Community Place reassures customers their personal records are safe...
thank you for coming in again, Mr. Prichard.
you can call me James.
you have an update on the case?
actually, we are trying to figure out if TJ had another motive.
like what?
TJ claims that he was paid to kill your wife and mother-in-law.
what?
by someone who wanted to hurt you, because of a business deal.
whose business?
have you ever seen this man?
no.
why, should I have?
does the name Richard Wolf mean anything to you?
no, and I'm not answering any more questions until you tell me what's going on.
okay.
I'm going to tell you something that's confidential, James.
you can't talk to anyone about this or it could contaminate the jury pool and the judge will be forced to change our venue.
none of us want to try this case in another county.
but I think it's only fair to let you know...
TJ wants to make a deal with the prosecutor's office.
he'll testify against a notorious drug lord if we give him a lighter sentence.
you promised.
Mr. Prichard.
I can't believe this is happening.
nothing has happened yet. - I trusted you.
you promised he wasn't going to get off easy, like that other little punk.
can you think of any reason someone might want to hurt you, your wife, or her mother?
you think this is because something I did?
I approve homeowner refinancing packages.
I stare at paperwork all day long.
Julie worked at the children's section of the public library, for Pete's sake.
her mother made meals for the disabled.
do you understand?
do you get it?
they're both dead now.
you want to use that to put away some drug guy?
I'm done talking to you.
please, sit down.
you have the man who killed them.
do your job.
put him away forever.
and leave me alone.
they just got married last year.
they were the same age as us, Jack.
he's just devastated.
they have any kids?
no, but they were trying.
Jack, that poor man's going to spend the rest of his life beating himself up for not being home that night.
well, I would, too.
who do you think is more guilty, the meth head who shot those poor women, or the kingpin who hired him to do it?
what about the kid driving the getaway car?
he didn't know about it.
he's basically a bystander.
he drove the guy away.
isn't that a crime?
Yeah, I could try to nail him.
but he's cooperated, and he's going to help me put the shooter away.
so, basically you got three bad guys.
you got your dumb kid, you got a guy who squeezed the trigger, and then you got the guy that ordered the killing.
the shooter says he was following orders.
Yeah, isn't that what they all say?
they were "following orders"?
I mean, both of them had to be willing, otherwise the whole thing wouldn't have happened.
exactly.
you're making deals all day?
one guy to get to another guy, to get to another guy?
Yeah.
I have to you... it's wearing me out.
come here.
let me see this.
now, looking at these calls, when the girlfriend's cell phone was in TJ's possession, you'll see a spate of calls over a two-day span for the same number.
that would be a two-day span right before the murders went down.
and this number belongs to?
one of Wolf's underlings.
Oh, so it seems that TJ was connected to Wolf.
what about James?
he's in hell.
I mean, he's grieving for his wife.
I don't think he knows anything about Richard Wolf.
well, you might want to rethink that.
Why? What?
two months ago, a backup computer tape went missing from James Prichard's office.
how could that tie to Wolf?
the computer tape had over 30, 000 credit applications on it.
one tape? - Easy.
probably fetch somewhere in the low six figures.
meth addicts steal IDs for the dealers who pay them in drugs.
they go through your trash, they steal your mail.
the dealers take those IDs and sell them to people who convert them into actual cash.
the value of the stolen IDs are based on the person's credit limits.
but James Prichard's not a meth addict.
true, but the big dealers are now skipping right over the addicts and buying credit information from anyone who has insider access.
insiders like Prichard.
dealers are making as much or more from ID theft as from drugs.
that money buys chemicals, the chemicals make more drugs, which make more drug addicts, who steal more IDs, and the circle is complete.
but we don't have any real evidence that James was involved in stealing those IDs.
only that it appears that Wolf had his wife and mother-in-law killed.
that points to some kind of connection.
maybe he was being forced into working with Wolf.
theoretical.
maybe he decided to quit, and Richard decided to get even.
again, theoretical.
go back to friends, neighbors, coworkers.
see if anyone in Prichard's life found anything suspicious.
Annabeth? - I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get my head around the possibility that this guy's been playing me, and it's really hard to believe.
duly noted.
but remember, we're trying to get to Wolf without TJ.
hey
you're the one who wanted to have her cake and eat it, too.
afraid not. Never seen him.
is there anything else that sticks out in your mind from that night?
well, there was something.
it probably doesn't mean anything.
it happened the night after the murders.
after?
see that house across the street from the Prichards?
that's the Alavi family that lives there.
nice enough couple.
two darling little girls.
the night after the murders,
I took my little dog out before bedtime, and I saw them rushing around, throwing things into their car and then they just took off.
kids and everything.
they left when?
the day after the murders.
the woman deadheads her roses but leaves the milk out to spoil?
it looks like they left in a hurry.
well, there's a week's worth of mail left in the mailbox, and nobody called to cancel the newspaper.
I talked to the husband, a Vashar Alavi, the day of the murders.
he was a little on edge.
check this out.
look at the victim's house.
okay, imagine the possibility.
TJ's high. He's wired.
he's been told 5461 Tennessee Court.
5467 is across the street.
seven looks a lot like a one.
you think TJ killed the wrong people?
that's why the Prichard connection to Wolf never made any sense.
richard Wolf wanted these people dead, and they knew it, Lou.
they knew they were the targets.
that's why they left in such a hurry.
that's why they packed up their kids and ran.
well, we still don't know why they were the targets.
either way, we've better find them before wolf does we think TJ screwed up and killed the wrong people.
the wrong people?
it looks like the hit was meant for the neighbors across the street.
they moved out in a hurry, right after the murders, but no one knows where they went.
if that's true, then James Prichard is not the connection to prosecuting Wolf.
correct.
which you've been saying all along. Hat's off.
but that also means that we're no more capable of nailing Wolf today than we were yesterday.
ergo, we need TJ's testimony.
unless we find the neighbors.
you just told me you don't know where they are.
Vashar Alavi owned a dry cleaning business downtown, and he's originally from Iran.
Iran?
well, then he's long gone.
that's one of the few places that Richard Wolf can't find him.
you need to talk to TJ.
I promised James Prichard.
I gave him my word I wouldn't let TJ walk.
Annabeth, you know you can't promise anyone anything in this business.
if we, as an office, choose to throw the little fish back to catch the big fish, we have to be able to do that without you getting in the way with your promises.
the "little fish" shot and killed two women.
Mrs. Prichard was 29 years old.
you still shouldn't have promised anything.
you're right, Steve, but I did.
what do you want?
I want TJ to get what he deserves, and I want Richard Wolf.
but to have any hope of that,
I need time to find these missing people.
we arraign TJ at 3: 00 tomorrow.
that's all the time you're getting.
if you can't find him by then, we take the deal.
the Department of Environmental Management requires every dry cleaner to keep a purchase log of this particular chemical.
it's called "perc"?
chloral Ethylene.
also known as perc. And guess what?
perc happens to be the latest craze among larger meth lab operations.
it speeds up the methamphetamine drying process, while simultaneously stretching the bulk of the final product.
basically, your user winds up smoking dry cleaning fluid with some meth mixed in.
and, let me guess, it also makes it more addictive?
everybody wins.
so, tell me why this log's important.
well, about seven months ago,
Mr. Alavi reported some perc being stolen right around here.
who stole it?
police never solved it.
but if you notice from this log, perc purchases nearly tripled immediately following the theft.
well, whatever went down, it sounds like Mr. Alavi's in the meth supply business.
well, either that or he's planning on opening three more dry cleaners.
we've got to find these people.
I've got the paralegals checking the airlines,
border Patrol, State Department.
if they've left, there will be a paper trail.
so if we don't find anything, it could mean they're still in Indianapolis?
let's hope we come up empty-handed.
could you check out the passport info on these folks for me, please?
Thanks.
destination: Tehran, Iran
it's a family of four, two girls.
they would have checked in last week.
they tried to book tickets to Iran,
Lauren Alavi, the littlest girl, she couldn't get out.
she was born in this country, so she's never had a passport.
now, her parents filed an expedited application.
but with an Iranian father...
well, the State Department is taking its time.
I figured the guy didn't want to leave his family behind.
so, they're still here, we just don't know where.
I had Juliet call every hotel in Indianapolis.
she found a match of three families with two little girls, but only one paid for everything in cash, and only one didn't provide a checkout date.
you are so good.
I can be.
Indianapolis Police!
open the door and I will shoot!
drop your weapon! It's the police!
Mr. Alavi!
we're here to talk about Richard Wolf.
do not shoot!
my hands are up in the air!
we know you were supplying Richard Wolf with perc, Mr. Alavi.
now, that's a felony.
I don't think you can prove this.
we have documentation showing that you ordered far more chemicals per month than you could possibly use.
please, my husband's health is very bad.
I must think of my wife and my children.
if I help you, they will kill all of us.
actually, as long as Richard Wolf is free, he will try and hunt you down.
if you cooperate, we can get him off the streets.
we can provide you with new identities, get you in the Witness Protection program.
it'll be a new start.
Vashi-zam, think of the girls.
tell me what I can do.
well, you can start by telling me why Richard Wolf wants you dead.
one day in March,
I see that my storage area is empty.
someone has cut the lock and removed all the solvents, the perc.
so I called the police.
they make a report, but nothing happens.
then not long after, some men come to me and say we took the perc, and now we're going to pay you to give it to us.
this is bad, I said no, I don't want to get paid.
but they say they will kill me if I refuse.
they work for a very big man, Richard Wolf.
what am I gonna do?
so this goes on for some months and I don't tell my wife.
and my doctor says I have a bleeding ulcer.
and one day she asks me what's wrong and so I tell her.
she tells me it has to stop.
how did Richard Wolf pay you?
they took my bank account number and put the money in there.
they told me if I tried to tell anyone, I will go to jail because the police will see that I'm getting paid.
so you think we got enough?
we got it all.
Mr. Alavi can prove Wolf was paying him and when he stopped supplying chemicals,
wolf threatened to kill him.
and the meth labs?
Alavi is taking the police to where he delivered the chemicals, and we expedited an arrest warrant for Wolf.
so we're hoping these are his last free hours on Earth.
Becky, I bet you're looking for me.
you are aware that TJ's being arraigned at 3: 00?
we were just talking about what we should wear.
I'm in olive, but do you think pinstripes are better?
Yeah. - Olive brings out my eyes.
if you want to make this deal with TJ, this is your last chance.
actually, we found another way to get Wolf, so...
so don't despair, you were offering 15 years if TJ wore a wire.
yes?
well, how does 30 years to life sound if he testifies that Richard ordered him to make the hit?
or?
or, I'd guess we'd have to up the charges to whatever we're charging Richard with.
so that's him?
that's Richard Wolf?
the one, the only.
he looks smaller in person.
Rachel, call my lawyer.
Yeah.
they found the meth lab in a warehouse downtown.
they're going in.
what's wrong?
he was fine, and then...
I saw Richard Wolf down the hall.
it was just for one second, and now his stomach is...
I don't think...
not today.
Mr. Alavi, I'm going to be right in there with you.
there's nothing to worry about.
do you want me to get you some water?
I just wanted to thank you for coming.
Mr. Prichard, I,uh...
how are the girls?
they're well. Thank you.
you know, sometimes the only blessing I can think of out of all of this, is that your girls are still alive.
would you do me a favor?
sure. Anything.
make sure you put him away in there today.
that I will do.
I'm counting on you.
please, I'm ready.
okay.
you knew it was illegal to sell these chemicals to Mr. Wolf.
Yes.
so why did you continue?
he threatened to come to my house and kill me if I ever refused.
but you did stop.
Yes, I wanted out of all of it.
what happened then?
Mr. Wolf called to warn me.
I begged him to let me out of it, but he said he wasn't playing games.
what happened next?
I...
I bought a gun.
you thought you could protect yourself?
I was desperate.
and we quickly made a plan to leave, but then we realized we didn't have a passport for my youngest daughter.
and then that night...
the neighbors in the house across the street were killed.
it was horrible.
the next day the police are everywhere, so when it got dark, we took the girls and we ran away.
can you please point out Mr. Wolf in the courtroom today?
that's him, there.
did Mr. Wolf pay you to commit murder?
Yes. Not in money, in drugs.
what did he tell you exactly?
he told me to go to 5461 Tennessee Court.
but you didn't go to that house.
I was high on meth, and I screwed up 5461 with 5467.
what else did he tell you to do?
he told me to...
shoot the whole family, even the kids.
but there weren't any kids.
because I got the wrong house.
but I was so wasted.
if there had been any kids,
I'd have killed them, too.
on the first count of conspiracy to commit murder, "we, the jury, find the defendant Richard Robert Wolf, guilty.
on the second count of conspiracy to commit murder, "we find the defendant, Richard Robert Wolf, guilty.
I like it when you win.
what did Wolf get?
life without parole.
I like it.
you know, I'm still holding you to that deal.
Oh... it was... it was a back rub.
no, no.
actually, I think it was you washing the dishes in the morning.
right, right.
baby, I'd clean the whole damn kitchen for you.
sync: fisherchen -=www. ydy. com/bbs=
make a sound and you die.
Hey, I need you to go to the hospital and interview a victim.
uh, absolutely.
on my way. Just let me grab a cup of coffee.
morning, Maureen.
morning.
what is it？ insomnia?
breast-feeding.
breast-feeding?
your kid's sleeping through the night.
who are you breast-feeding?
excuse me.
I'm trying to build up my breast-milk reserve, so I get up at night to pump.
okay, first of all, we agreed to never discuss this subject again, and second of all, how long are you gonna keep this up?
supplying nutrients and immunities to my baby?
as long as I can, Steve.
you're not gonna be one of those moms who breast-feeds their kid until they're or 12 or something, right?
because that's creepy.
I'm not gonna be creepy and can we please add this to the list of conversations we won't be having?
works for me.
the victim's name is Casey Wurth.
a guy forced his way into her home last night, raped and beat her.
cops arrest anybody?
not yet, but they will.
Brian Ford was released three weeks ago after serving time for raping two women.
last night was right up his alley.
home invasion, knife used to subdue the victim.
1412 Goren Place， four blocks from the crime scene， and about a mile or so away from where I live.
you're gonna be seeing a lot those.
interview the victim, then we'll go from there.
okay.
wouldn't want to be you today, pal.
I had my key ready before I got to the door.
you're supposed to do that so you can get in the house as soon as possible.
I always did that.
take your time, Casey.
he pushed me inside.
I guess he hit me, because I went down.
he kept hitting me.
I begged him to stop, but he wouldn't.
did you recognize him?
it was dark.
I only saw a sliver of his face.
he was maybe six feet, dark brownish hair.
I could taste blood in my mouth.
it didn't seem real.
I could feel myself going out and I knew I wouldn't wake up.
but then I did and... he was gone.
Casey, do you have any idea who might've done this to you?
was anyone threatening you?
old boyfriends?
no.
I'm sorry, I'm not helping.
Oh, you're not gonna be able to find him.
I'm gonna do everything I can.
these hedges are pretty high， perfect place to lie in wait.
do you think he was after her specifically?
I don't know.
she doesn't see anyone when she's coming up the sidewalk.
gets to the door， she's grabbed from behind.
seemed like the guy was already there.
stepped out of the shadows.
any amount of force he used has already bought him an upgrade to a class A felony.
lying in wait?
I could go for consecutive sentences.
when can we expect
DNA analysis on hair and fibers?
there are no hair and fibers.
no semen, either. He must've used a condom.
also wore gloves, so no fingerprints.
guy's a pro.
this case is gonna come down to an ID.
but the victim has no idea who would've done this to her.
her neighbors do.
have you talked to them yet?
got a unit over there right now.
apparently he's claiming he was at the mall.
he did eight years for raping two women.
Yeah.
that's just not enough.
Maureen: Can't find what you're looking for?
I forgot what I was looking for.
do you need to go home and take a nap or something?
what I need is a pot of real coffee.
but I've already had my one cup for the day.
so, I'm fine. Thank you.
you don't seem fine.
you seem kind of out of it.
I just spent the morning listening to a girl who was violated in unspeakable ways.
so, if I'm a little depleted emotionally,
I think that makes me human, right?
excuse me.
Danny, I need a list of registered sex offenders living in a 20 miles radius of Casey Wurth's attack.
also, get me whatever we have on Brian Ford, convicted rapist, recently paroled.
Brian Ford. Got it.
no problem.
just got a head's up.
there's gonna be a town meeting this afternoon about the guy on the flyers.
I told them you'd be there.
the last thing we need is villagers with torches running through the street trying to capture their own monster.
just tell them that the prosecutor's office is investigating and let us do our job.
see what you can do to calm things down.
no.
no, no, no, no. You don't want me representing you at that meeting.
why not?
Steve, I live around here.
I'm with the villagers on this.
I don't want a rapist living next door.
he has served his time.
according to the state of Indiana, he is a private citizen.
he is a repeat offender and he may have just brutally raped Casey Wurth.
then you will prove that in a court of law and put him away.
meanwhile, go to the meeting.
don't let it get out of control.
you wanted to see me?
Yes.
I'd like to make a suggestion on how we handle this rape case.
I'm all ears.
we're gonna have to move pretty quickly to stay ahead of public sentiment.
Annabeth's exhausted.
she'll be fine.
I'm not so sure.
nobody forced her to come back to work.
if she wants to juggle a baby and a job, that's her business.
my mother used to say the definition of juggling is something's always falling.
Steve, we cannot afford a mistake on this.
so what do you want to do?
take it away from her?
maybe.
no.
all I'm saying is, maybe we're expecting
and as her supervisor, I'm concerned.
part of managing people is knowing when to push them and when to let them figure things out for themselves.
Yes, but Steve...
she will be fine.
but you are now her supervisor, so feel free to supervise.
this is Danny Robel from the D. A.'s office.
I need all existing records on Brian Ford.
uh, rap sheet, prison record, probation report.
thank you.
Thanks.
Hello, everyone.
I'm George Roberts, Councilman for this district.
I live at 1517 Goren Place.
Yes, that's right.
the same street as Brian Ford.
so I'm very invested in keeping him under control.
why don't they lock him up?
I'm going to let Officer Harmon answer that question.
at the moment, we have no evidence tying him to the crime.
what's he doing in our neighborhood?
he should not be allowed to live among decent people.
I agree, sir.
but you're gonna have to change the laws.
now, maybe the representative from the prosecutor's office could speak to that.
ms. Chase, are you here?
come here, sweetie.
I'm Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Annabeth Chase.
officer Harmon is correct.
the laws allow Brian Ford to live wherever he wants as long as he registers as a sex offender and checks in with his parole officer.
but we're doing everything we can to figure out who committed the recent assault.
Brian Ford did it.
that's right. That's right.
we'll need to make that case, sir.
so we're supposed to wait for him to hurt somebody else?
I'm afraid to jog by myself in the morning or even take my dog to the park.
that's why we're here, right? To organize a neighborhood watch.
I've been watching him since the day he moved in.
I saw on the Internet that he was being let out.
that's all anybody was doing, just putting the information on a website.
so I started following him.
he got away from me that night.
I mean, what are the odds that the one night I can't find him, him that girl gets raped?
we can't wait for law enforcement.
we've got to get rid of him.
that's right.
now, now be careful Don.
be careful. We'd hate to see you get into trouble.
no trouble at all.
in fact I've got my 45 out in the truck.
I'll be happy to go castrate the son of a bitch right now.
that's the way!
I'm sorry, Sir, what is your name?
don Wheeler.
Mr. Wheeler, we're all a little upset, but I'm sure you don't mean to make threats in the presence of a police officer and a prosecutor.
why not?
look, I live here, too, okay?
I want to feel safe, but we have to let the police and the courts do their jobs.
all right, all right. We need to focus our energy.
I've got sign-up sheets for each block.
if we can organize a successful neighborhood watch, keep an eye on this guy 24 hours a day, maybe we can discourage him from even living here.
so, if you'll just step up and sign up， we can get this program rolling right away.
all we need is your name, your address, your phone number and what hours you might be available.
I don't know who scares me the most: Brian Ford or the guy who volunteered to castrate him.
if Brian Ford ever got near you, I'd kill him.
Jack.
he's been living less than a mile from us, okay?
and I had no idea.
and what would you have done if you'd known?
I don't know.
that's where he lives.
look at those flowers.
Yeah, all he has to do is cut through a few yards, walk a couple of blocks.
we'll be okay, Jack. You're damn right.
you're damn right we're gonna be okay, cause from now on, I'm keeping an eye on this guy.
you're starting to sound like Don Wheeler.
well, he's got a point.
listen, I just, I don't want you getting all worked up and doing something stupid, okay?
it's not stupid to want to protect your family.
no, honey, of course not.
and it's not stupid to believe that rapists will rape again.
let's go home.
did you hear what happened to Brian Ford?
Yeah. I'm on my way to the police station to hear his complaint.
any word on his alibi？
nobody ID'd him at the mall.
the police went store-to-store with his mug shot.
we need the surveillance tapes.
and you get the privilege of going through them all.
look at me, I'm in a dream.
I got to go.
nothing like listening to a convicted rapist whine first thing in the morning.
get those tapes.
I had that car less than a month.
deputy Prosecuting Attorney Annabeth Chase, this is Brian Ford.
I want these people prosecuted.
they set my car on fire, they took a baseball bat to my windows.
did you see who did it?
I didn't see their faces.
these people are crazy.
and I demand protection.
I am a United States citizen.
I have the right to feel safe.
we all have that right.
unfortunately, some people don't respect it.
I didn't rape that girl.
I was at the mall.
we checked that out, Mr. Ford.
nobody remembers seeing you there.
well, that's where I was.
so you better start looking for somebody else and take those flyers down with my face on them or I will sue this city for all it's worth.
send me a copy of his statement.
I'll look at it.
Brian Ford fits the physical description.
you factor in his recent release, as far as I'm concerned, he's our guy. The M.O.S are different.
they both used knives.
that's not what I'm talking about.
okay, so where are we with this?
Brian Ford's prior attacks were considered power rapes.
he used a knife to control his victims, but he never cut them or beat them.
he tried to engage them in sexual fantasies.
and Casey Wurth?
hers was a classic anger rape.
the assailant beat the hell out of her.
so the guy was angry.
Brian Ford's been locked up for the last eight years.
that'll piss a guy off.
you think Brian Ford changed his M.O.S ?
I think he wanted revenge and he got it on Casey Wurth.
we need to get him off the street.
Maureen, I have to make this stick in court.
I mean, I can't just go into a bail hearing and say, "We all just think it's him, Your Honor.
what do you need?
to do my homework, to widen the net.
I just want to make sure we get the right guy.
okay, do it.
okay.
let's run possible likely and look-alikes in the area who fit the M.O.S.
Danny will check out Brian Ford's alibi.
we have received 250 calls today all asking why we have not arrested Brian Ford.
Yeah, about that-- bad news.
his alibi checked out.
he's caught on a security camera at the mall at 8: 30 that night. The rape occurred around 10: 30.
that still gives him plenty of time.
let's see what we have.
these are the 15 registered sex offenders in the radius.
four of them don't fit the physical description, three are pedophiles and two have been missing for over a year.
missing?
it happens. Guys register and then leave the area.
unfortunate flaw in the system.
that leaves these six.
they've all been out of prison for at least a year, and, to our knowledge, none of re-offended.
Greg Weiss, eight years for raping an elderly neighbor.
Doug Cronan, raped a 16-year-old girl across the street.
alan Rayfield did ten years for the abduction and rape of a woman he worked with.
now he says he was with his girlfriend the night of Casey's attack.
these guys have girlfriends?
go figure.
bill Nava, preyed on hookers.
ed Young stalked and raped a nurse who reminded him of his mother.
last but not least, Brian Ford.
who now has a semi-believable alibi.
which could be enough to confuse a jury.
the victim said she got a glimpse of him, right?
I'll put together a six pack of them and see if she can make an I. D.
Casey, I'm about to ask you to do something very difficult, but I need you to concentrate and be honest.
okay.
Casey, I want you to visualize your attacker.
I'm going to present you with a piece of paper showing six photos.
I'm not indicating whether your attacker's in there.
do you understand?
Yes.
see if you recognize him.
I don't know.
I don't know.
hold on.
I think that's him. Number three?
Yes.
are you sure?
you're under no obligation.
Yes. Oh, my God, that's him.
that's the man who raped me.
arrest him.
we got him.
we got him.
that Brian Ford be held without bond.
the victim picked him out of a photo array.
my client was identified because his face is plastered on flyers all over town.
the prosecution has no physical evidence, a security tape verifies my client's alibi.
I will have experts lined up around the block to argue mistaken I. D. and false memory.
you will have your chance, Mr. Drucker.
I'm holding Mr. Ford on one million dollars bail, but I'm giving Ms. Chase 72 hours to prove to me that he is a flight risk or a risk to community safety.
next case.
her victim's I. D. isn't going to be enough to hold this guy.
all right, put a rush on the lab results.
let's see if anything comes back that matches Brian Ford.
search his house. Nothing gets by, okay?
I'll meet you there. You got it.
ms. Chase， I brought you these.
what is it?
my surveillance reports， photos, videos.
you can use them to put Brian Ford away.
Mr. Wheeler, what is going on here?
we're all concerned, but you seem to be taking it to another level.
maybe I just have a lower tolerance for this kind of thing.
your behavior is dangerously close to becoming criminal.
now, you need to stop obsessing about this case and get back to your normal life.
I haven't had a normal life in five years.
not since one of these creeps took my daughter from me.
I'm... I'm sorry, I didn't know.
she was 14， walking home from school, and he grabbed her off the street, drove away with her.
she was missing for six days.
you know how long six days is?
I went on the news, pleading...
the whole time she was laying at the bottom of the Geist reservoir.
somebody raped her and strangled her, and threw her in the lake like she was some kind of trash.
did they find him?
no.
no, the police said he probably just moved on to another town, another state.
there are plenty of lakes.
Mr. Wheeler, you understand
Brian Ford was in prison five years ago.
he couldn't have raped your daughter.
he raped somebody's daughter.
got the lab results back from the crime scene.
Casey Wurth's blood, broken glass.
was there glass in Brian Ford's car?
there was glass, but we couldn't make a positive match.
of course, the fire didn't help.
so you find anything interesting?
a couple of changes of clothes in the closet, frozen dinners in the fridge.
guy wasn't living large.
he likes TV.
huh.
he highlights the TV listings so he won't miss his favorite shows and the flower garden.
what?
I don't know.
he's... he's got hobbies.
so?
so nothing.
check his phone bill, see who his friends are, I talk to his cable company.
I want to know what he's watching and when.
I'll go back and take a look at Mr. Wheeler's so-called evidence.
you need help going through all that?
that's why God invented paralegals.
Mr. Wheeler put captions on the back of the photos.
he took notes.
can you say "obsessive"?
okay, so where do we stand?
do we have enough for a trial?
I don't know.
I mean, I've handled a lot of rape cases, and there are certain behaviors you're going to see in repeat offenders.
I'm not seeing them.
and, look, he's not initiating contact with women, old girlfriends, girls on the street.
he's not calling sex lines, he's not watching porn.
look at his cable bills.
he's catching up on his Adam Sandler movies.
you're looking for an obsession with sex.
you said yourself it was an anger rape.
okay, but nothing we have on Brian Ford supports the profile of an angry guy.
he watches television, he seldom leaves the house.
when he does, he keeps his head down, he doesn't talk to people.
he made a flower garden for God's sake.
what are you saying?
his mug shot was plastered all over town, and maybe that is why she ID'd him.
I'm saying, Maureen, right now,
I could not convince a jury that Brian Ford raped Casey Wurth because I'm not convinced myself.
I'm saying we may be onto the wrong guy.
all right, then talk to the victim again.
Casey, I hate to ask you this, but I have to.
are you absolutely sure Brian Ford is the man who attacked you?
you don't believe me?
if he's the one, I will go after him with everything I have.
but if he's not, the defense will drive a hole through our case.
and, Casey, whoever did this to you will still be out there and will do it to someone else.
so I need you to think,
I need you to put yourself back there...
I don't want to put myself back there.
I want it all to go away.
I want to be able to walk into my house without breaking into a cold sweat.
I want to stop looking at the men on the street, imagining all the horrible things they're capable of.
I want to be able to sleep.
I can't sleep because I know he's there in the dark.
I see him over me, I... hear him.
I'm sorry.
it's him.
it has to be him.
it's him.
I'm sure. It's him.
what's going on?
I'm going to pump.
go back to bed.
baby, it's 4: 22 in the morning.
you got to get up soon.
it's okay, I need to do this.
you're going to burn out, honey, okay?
Haley's okay.
I don't want her to be okay.
I want her to be as healthy as possible.
I don't want her getting sick because I decided to go back to work.
come here.
how are we supposed to do this? Hmm?
seriously, I mean... what do we do when there's people out there like Brian Ford?
we look out for her.
we lock our doors and teach her to do the same.
and I go to work tomorrow and try to put the bad guys away.
sprint's new fai to Casey Wurth, I slept on it.
I just don't think Brian Ford's our guy.
what do you mean, this isn't the guy?
the victim ID'd him. This is the guy.
she needs him to be the guy, Steve.
there are a lot of sex offenders out there.
it could be any one of a hundred.
then it's probably exactly who we think it is.
Annabeth's the one who has to argue it in court, and she doesn't feel she can make a case.
so let's figure out what we're going to do.
well, I'll tell you what we're not going to do.
release Brian Ford before we've charged somebody else.
town'll go crazy and I'll get another call from the D. A.
okay, where were you before you zeroed in on Brian Ford?
we had five other likely suspects, but we never finished going over their alibis or cross-checking their histories against Casey Wurth's.
bring them in.
keep it quiet and make it quick. You got 24 hours before you have to be back in front of a judge again.
tell me about that night.
I already told you.
and now you'll tell me again.
my mother brought me dinner.
we watched Jeopardy.
that's our thing.
I don't know anything about it, except I didn't do it.
I was at a card game.
and I got three buddies that'll tell you the same thing.
so the name means nothing?
Casey Wurth， come on, she's your neighbor, man.
you are aware that being at the track is a violation of your parole?
Annabeth.
Hey, Danny, what's up?
I got a hit.
Casey worked at a warehouse store a year ago with Alan Rayfield.
it's the same M.O.S as the rape he was convicted for.
great.
Mr. Rayfield?
this is Deputy Prosecutor Chase. Open up.
let's check around back.
Yeah.
excuse me.
you're Alan Rayfield's girlfriend, right?
could you tell us where he is?
I don't know, out of town?
I'm sorry, what was your name again?
right.
sunny, we need to find him right now, so I'm going to ask you one more time.
Where's Alan?
I don't know.
wrong answer.
take her in.
you brought in Rayfield's girlfriend.
Yeah, and I think she's covering for him.
you want me to handle it?
no, I can do it.
if we're gonna break this girl, things need to get very ugly very quickly.
Maureen, who are you talking to?
I am offering to help, so you don't feel like it's all on you.
it is all on me.
I have to find the right guy, and if she knows who that is, she's gonna tell me.
you can watch from the observation room.
if I'm not getting the job done, come on in.
no mercy.
how long have you been seeing Alan Rayfield?
maybe six months.
you know he did time?
sure.
you know why? Yeah.
it doesn't bother you?
he's not like that with me.
you mean he doesn't stalk and rape you?
do you know what he did to the girl he worked with?
I don't want to know.
you should know who you're sleeping with.
who you're protecting.
I'm not.
you're lying for him, Sunny, we both know that.
he hid in her car.
put a gun to her head, told her to drive.
stop it, please.
he took her to the woods, raped and tortured her for seven hours.
stop.
he had a girlfriend then, too, Sunny.
she tried to lie for him, just like you.
I think that girlfriend should have been tried as an accessory.
she as good as held down his victim while Alan raped her.
is that what you're doing, Sunny?
is your self-esteem so low, you think the only love you're ever gonna get is from a sexual predator?
does he tell you he loves you?
because he's not capable of that.
he has a 72% chance of re-offending.
do you want him around your friends?
your sister?
God forbid you ever have children.
he wasn't with you that night, was he?
was he?
no.
I don't know where he was, but he wasn't with me.
I was just coming to see you.
they released you?
my brother posted bail. He had to put up his business.
it's not appropriate for you to be...
you should be ashamed of yourself.
you made me a target.
you made yourself a target when you raped two women.
now get out of my way.
no, no, no. Listen to me.
get your hands off of her.
Mr. Wheeler...
are you nuts?
they never should have let you out.
Freeze! Drop the weapon.
put your hands over your head.
Mr. Wheeler... I've got you covered.
please...
don't do this.
he's scum.
put the gun down. Don't ruin your life.
I don't have a life.
but I can do one good thing now.
I said drop the weapon.
Mr. Wheeler, please give me the gun.
please, give me the gun.
he deserves to die.
Annabeth Chase.
we spotted Rayfield at home.
now? Right now.
okay, I'll get a warrant. I'll meet you there.
alan Rayfield, you're under arrest for the rape of Casey Wurth.
get your hands off of me!
we found these gloves. They're caked with blood.
and he kept them? Souvenir.
excuse me. Sure.
ms. Chase, I hope you're not pinning this case on another victim I. D.
that ship has sailed.
no, Your Honor.
we have concrete evidence of Alan Rayfield's guilt.
during the vicious attack on Casey Wurth, a lamp was broken and shattered on the floor.
we found broken glass embedded in a pair of Mr. Rayfield's shoes.
the glass was a match to the broken glass from the lamp at the crime scene.
the search of Mr. Rayfield's apartment also yielded gloves, which matched the description of the gloves used by Casey Wurth's attacker.
initial tests show the gloves contain more than one person's blood.
I believe this evidence will allow us to solve not only this case, but other cases, as well.
your Honor, this was a violent, torturous sexual assault.
this is Mr. Rayfield's second such assault, and we intend to prosecute him on all possible counts, to the full extent of the law.
we believe he is a flight risk, as well as a danger to this community.
and, therefore, the state is asking,
your Honor, to hold him without bail until trial.
granted.
what do you want?
thirty.
how about 20?
thirty minimum.
I like my chances with a jury.
I'll talk to him.
we did it. We got him.
you did.
I hope you'll be able to sleep now.
Mr. Wheeler?
I heard you put in a good word for me.
you're being charged with a weapons violation and menacing.
but it's your first arrest.
I'm sure your lawyer will work something out.
I've been thinking about your daughter.
I'd like to reopen the case.
there have been a lot of advances in criminal forensics in the last five years.
I'd really like to take a shot, if that's okay with you.
I would appreciate that.
Hey, baby.
Hey. What's with the beeping?
it's an alarm system.
now, I don't mean to scare you,
I just figured...
hey... you okay?
Hey, something wrong?
I'm fine now.
is Haley asleep?
Yeah. I gave her a bottle; she went right off.
thank you.
I'm going to put this stuff away, and I'll meet you upstairs.
I've got to stop for a second.
but we're almost home; let's keep going.
I can't!
look at you.
I'm twice your age, and you can't keep up.
I'm trying, mom.
you are not trying.
looking great takes discipline, Jessica. It takes willpower.
what kind of family has dinner at 9: 00?
I told you I had to cover a second shift.
as it is, you hardly see your daughter.
what do you want me to do, mom?
you think I like being away?
you shouldn't have all the burden of paying the bills.
I'm trying to find a job, Helen.
you're not a surgeon.
you sell cars-- how hard can it be?
I don't sell cars.
I manage a dealership.
well, right now, you can't manage to pay the mortgage.
what does she want now?
she has a migraine. She probably wants her pills.
she could get them herself.
here you go.
good night.
wait, I need to talk to you.
mom, it's late.
no. We need to do this now.
it's about Paul.
he's not a good man, Jessica.
I know that you think he is, but you're wrong.
...is a good husband, a good father.
he was never what I wanted for you.
you knew that the day you got married.
I told you that one day he would disappoint you.
he won't! - You don't understand.
he already has.
I'm sorry, but...
Hey.
Hey.
sorry to call you at home.
it's fine.
my mother was visiting, so she said she'd stay and help jack with the baby, which means she'll be telling him everything we're doing wrong as parents, only she'll say them to Haley.
sweetheart, are you cold?
did your mother forget to put a sweater on you?
stuff like that. - Sounds annoying.
hopefully, jack can handle it.
what's our case?
guy killed his mother-in-law.
I just couldn't take it.
you don't know what she was like.
constant criticism.
she made Jessica crazy, called her fat, made her feel like a bad parent, a bad mother.
so you did this for her?
I did this for us.
I don't care what happens to me, I just wanted her out of our lives.
look, maybe I should have a lawyer.
you don't need a lawyer, Paul.
we know you did this.
you want to help yourself?
help me understand why.
Jessica was pregnant when we got married.
she was only 22.
she didn't want to believe that we were in love.
she thought Jessica was making a huge mistake, giving up her entire life.
that was a long time ago. - It never stopped!
nothing I ever did was good enough.
she made Jessica feel stupid for staying with me.
she was living in the house?
I lost my job a few months ago.
the joke is she came to help.
what would you do?
if you were me, would you get a lawyer?
you're doing fine.
it was always a competition.
anything Jessica did, Helen made it clear she could do it better.
what was Jessica supposed to do?
you get told you're nothing your entire life, you start to believe it.
are you sure I don't need a lawyer? I think I want...
you think? If I were you, Paul,
I'd be thinking about how to cooperate.
how many times did he say he wanted a lawyer?
he didn't. He phrased it as a question.
how many times?
I don't know-- we're fine.
we're not fine-- you just cut him off.
you stopped him from finishing his sentence.
I've been doing this a long time.
suspects ask for advice. Doesn't mean we have to give it.
we do if his intent is clear.
it wasn't.
that guy shot a woman point-blank. I'm doing what's necessary.
you're about to get the confession kicked because you pushed too hard.
I didn't. - You did.
let's get him a lawyer, and then, let's see if we still have a case.
think the defense will try to kick the confession?
any decent defense attorney would try.
Randall asked about a lawyer more than once, and Branch was pretty aggressive about changing the subject.
what else do we have besides the confession?
the case is solid
Randall's prints are on the gun, he's got blood on his shirt, he even has gunshot residue on his hands. So did the wife.
well, she took the gun from Randall after he fired it, so, yeah, she has residue on her, but she was a witness, nothing more.
is she really going to help us?
I mean, he's her husband.
I can't sleep.
I mean, look at me. I'm a wreck.
take your time.
the hardest part is that
I know in his mind, Paul thought that he was protecting me.
he just wanted my mother to leave us alone.
he committed an intentional murder.
I know.
I see him sitting in the courtroom, and sometimes...
I see the man that I married.
and then, I see my mother's face.
I know this must be difficult.
I want you to know that my mother made me crazy.
she could be mean, hurtful, sometimes on purpose, but she didn't deserve...
whatever she was...
I loved her.
she was my mother.
so what happens now?
we have a suppression hearing this morning.
Paul's attorney is trying to exclude his confession.
can he do that?
he claims Paul asked for a lawyer during his interrogation.
normally, we'd be more confident, but the judge we drew is known to be tough on the police.
he was a civil rights attorney before he took the bench.
Jessica, we could lose this.
your husband's confession could be suppressed.
he's not my husband anymore.
detective, prior to taking the defendant's statement? Did you read him his Miranda rights?
Yes. - At any time, did he tell you that he wanted a lawyer?
no, he never used those words.
thank you.
no further questions.
let's talk about the words that he did use.
I have a copy of the transcript here.
my client raised the issue of a lawyer three times.
he never said he wanted one.
well, not two minutes into the statement, he says, "maybe I should get a lawyer."
a few minutes later, he asked the question,"do you think I should get a lawyer?
that's right, he raised it as a question.
and you ignored him.
and the last time, you deliberately cut him off.
I'm a detective. It's my job to keep suspects talking.
so you admit you cut him off on purpose?
objection. Your honor, the law is clear.
a suspect doesn't invoke his right to counsel unless he makes a clear request.
it was clear! - It wasn't.
he used words like "maybe" and "I think I want.
your honor, there are no magic words.
he doesn't have to say, "I want a lawyer.
the issue is my client's intent.
and you think his intent was to get an attorney?
Absolutely. My client was intimidated.
detectives aren't mind readers.
they don't have to interpret every sentence for subtle requests.
I agree, but this wasn't exactly subtle, Ms. Scofield.
he raised the issue three times, each time, he was deliberately diverted from his purpose.
your honor...
I'm sorry, Ms. Scofield, but Mr. Hellman is right.
there are no magic words.
I saw the tape.
it's clear to me that Mr. Randall wanted help.
the confession is out.
these liberal judges that sit up there on their high horse.
it wasn't the judge, George.
you pushed it-- we warned you.
Hey, that guy wanted to confess. I didn't exactly twist his arm.
okay, look, it's done.
the goal is now to get ready for trial.
George, bring everything we have on Paul Randall.
I want statements from friends, neighbors, ex-colleagues.
Maureen, look deeper into the marriage. Find out what was really going on at home.
I'm on it. - We also need to prep Jessica.
now that the confession is out, Hellman's going to go after her on the stand.
Annabeth, may I have a word?
I think this family's been through enough. I don't want to see this trial get ugly.
are you considering a plea?
maybe. I think I can get him to take eight years.
eight years.
Doug, he shot an unarmed grandmother in her bed.
you lost the confession. We both know how hard I can make this.
but you won't.
you said the same thing in the Calvin Riggs trial, Doug.
you talk like you'll do anything to win, but in the end...
look, Annabeth, Riggs was a one-time thing.
now, don't mistake an act of kindness for weakness.
I won't give eight years for an intentional murder.
we'll take our chances with a jury.
I got to run. I'm supposed to meet Maureen and Steve before the judge sits at 9: 00.
okay, do I have everything? Where are my books?
how do I look?
first day at trial for you is always like the first day of school, huh?
except I'm not worried about whether the cool kids are going to like me.
Oh, really? What about the jury?
hmm. Now I'm worried.
Yeah, well, you look great.
and you are one of the cool kids.
thank you.
I'll call you from work. - All right.
so how does it look?
not bad.
would have been a slam dunk with a confession, but we've still got a case.
I agree.
we start with Jessica, lay out what happened, then move to the forensics.
how strong is the science?
strong enough.
we've got gunshot residue on the defendant's hand, and blood spatter on his shirt.
good, what about Jessica?
we're on our way to meet her now.
she's vulnerable on a few keys points, and Hellman's not going to make it easy, but if she can hold up on cross, we should be okay.
all right, well, let's get it done.
just tell the story very simply.
the jury needs to hear your version of the events.
my version?
there's only one version.
not in court. Not when someone is facing life in prison.
now, you need to be prepared, Jessica, they will come after you.
for what?
your prints are on the gun.
a gun you bought.
for protection, not to murder my mother.
we know that, but we want you to be ready in case the defense goes there.
paul wouldn't do that.
and if his lawyer tried, he'd stop him.
I was in my mother's room, we were talking, and when I looked up, I saw Paul with the gun.
did he say anything?
no. I called to him, but he didn't answer.
he just raised the gun and shot her.
what happened next?
nothing. He just stood there looking at me.
I took the gun out of his hands, went to the phone and called the police.
your witness.
you fought with your mother often, didn't you?
Yes.
now, the truth is she was brutally critical of you, wasn't she?
sometimes.
she didn't approve of your looks, your marriage, the way you raised your daughter, did she?
a lot of mothers disagree.
and didn't you go to a therapist because you were traumatized by your relationship with her?
Yes, but... - and didn't you take antidepressants prescribed for you by that therapist?
objection. Your honor, where is this going?
I'll tell you where it's going.
there were two people in the house that day, and I want to know who had the real motive to kill Mrs. Brooks.
objection. - Overruled.
make your point, Mr. Hellman, and make it fast.
you hated your mother, didn't you.
no.
Mrs. Randall, you're under oath.
now, your friends and your neighbors have all heard you talk about how angry she made you...
objection. - ...And meanwhile...
now counsel is testifying.
no one has ever heard my client say one word about your mother!
sustained!
the jury will disregard the last question.
whose gun is this?
did you purchase this weapon, Mrs. Randall?
there were break-ins in the neighborhood, I was scared.
my client didn't want this gun, did he?
please say something.
in fact, he refused to go with you when you went to learn how to shoot it.
Objection!
I'll go you one better.
chambers, both of you.
that was over the line.
I was just doing my job.
doing your job? You intentionally misled the jury.
you can't accuse her unless it's in good faith.
all right, enough.
Doug, I admire your passion, but she's right, some of that was over the line.
that being said, Ms. Chase you have the burden of proof here.
you have to prove that Mr. Randall is guilty, and part of that includes proving that Mrs. Randall isn't. Are we clear?
Yes.
Doug, I assume you're done on cross.
I think so. - Fine.
I think we've all had enough for today.
we'll pick this up again in the morning.
so...
what do you think of my eight years now?
are you kidding me?
you just accused an innocent woman of murder in open court.
Hey, I warned you.
let me tell you something. You think you scored points in there?
you're wrong, this jury's smarter than that.
Yeah, well, maybe, maybe not.
but don't forget you need a unanimous verdict, I only need one person to have a doubt.
see you tomorrow.
get some sleep, you're going to need it!
well, I've known Jessica since college.
she's a good person.
but I can't lie...
she was always angry about her mother.
she spent a fortune going to a therapist.
we all love Paul.
he's a little quiet, but he was always nice and helpful to everyone.
he was a great neighbor.
please tell me you found something new on Paul Randall.
we did-- he's a great guy, always so nice and helpful.
I came up empty, too.
so what do we know about his marriage?
I looks solid.
Jessica said they hit a rough patch a few years ago.
paul was drinking, but they made it past it.
we ran his cell records; nothing unusual.
I requested his credit card statements for the last year.
go back a little further.
we need the jury to see who this guy really is.
right now, he's too clean.
I agree.
we know the guy confessed, but the jury doesn't.
and if I were sitting in that jury box, I might have some doubt.
you were right, he's totally twisting everything.
he knows I didn't kill her, but now those people think you did fine.
you told the truth, Jessica, we need to trust the jury to see that.
I'm calling a forensic expert next.
that testimony could get a little graphic, but I really need you to be there.
the jury needs to see that this was your mother and you cared about her.
you think you can handle it?
at the time Mrs. Brooks was killed, she was sitting in bed.
as you can see, she was propped up at a 45-degree angle.
is that significant?
Absolutely.
Mrs. Brooks was killed by a single bullet.
it entered her chest here, and exited her back four inches below.
if you track the path with a trace rod, you can see the trajectory, and you can also see that whoever was holding the gun had to be at least six feet tall.
is 5'5."
in your opinion, could she have fired that shot?
not without raising her arm in a very unnatural way.
now, did you find any other physical evidence to connect the defendant to the crime?
Yes, I found gunshot residue on Mr. Randall's right hand, and a very fine blood spatter on his shirt.
can you explain that?
Yes.
in this kind of shooting, most of the spatter is propelled out the back of the wound, but a very fine mist, or "blowback" is sprayed from the front as well.
I found that mist-- of the victim's blood on Mr. Randall's shirt.
thank you. No further questions.
Helen Brooks suffered from chronic migraines, didn't she?
correct.
and these migraines were so severe at times that she required a special bed?
Yes, the headboard of the bed was adjustable. You could raise or lower it using a remote.
and the fact is, she was holding onto that remote when she was shot.
objection.
speculation. Facts not in evidence.
withdrawn.
you tell me, Mr. Schmidt, if she was holding onto that remote, and if she squeezed it after she was shot...
objection. - I'll allow it.
that would change the angle of the headboard, wouldn't it?
if one squeeze could raise it up?
how would that look if she were sitting up by a few degrees?
could you put that up there?
your honor, this is fair game, counselor.
so, now, the shooter could be as short as 5'5."
you say you found gunshot residue on my client's hands, is that correct?
Yes.
did you forget to mention that you also found it on Mrs. Randall's?
Mrs. Randall took her husband's gun.
in such a case, we would expect to see some transfer.
either that or she was the one that shot the victim.
objection.
your client had blood spatter on his shirt.
which means he was there when the shot was fired, it doesn't mean he fired the shot.
no, but... - thank you.
nothing further.
remember, I only need one to have a doubt.
redirect, your honor.
proceed.
sir, in your expert opinion, how likely is it that Helen Brooks hit that remote after she was shot?
extremely unlikely.
and how likely is it that she held that remote down long enough to move that headboard in a significant way?
I've been a forensic analyst for ten years.
it's more than unlikely, it's almost impossible.
almost impossible, that's what he said. He couldn't rule it out completely.
so where's the jury now?
it's hard to say.
as crazy as it sounds, if they think she hit that remote, we got problems.
can I interrupt?
please.
I ran Paul Randall's credit card statements going back the past two years.
get this:
he visited a local motel five times over the past six weeks.
do you think he was having an affair?
either that or he gets really sleepy in the middle of the day and he can't quite make it home.
I'm headed over there to see if the manager remembers him.
also found a hospital payment.
an emergency room visit a year ago.
turns out he fell and hit his head.
I don't get it. - Neither did I, but then I interviewed the E. R. Doctor who treated him.
paul Randall fell because he was drunk.
the doctor said he was an alcoholic.
Jessica said he used to drink, but that he stopped.
he did-- eight months ago.
our choir boy went to aa.
this is the name of his sponsor.
I don't believe this.
why are we getting this information now?
I'm sorry, Steve, we had a confession and an eyewitness...
that's not good enough, George!
we should have had this information.
Maureen, check it out.
if Paul Randall showed his true self to anyone, it's that guy.
yes?
I'm Maureen Scofield, I'm with the D. A.'S office.
I need to ask you a few questions about Paul Randall.
well...
I don't feel comfortable talking about Paul.
I know you were his aa sponsor.
I can't talk about it.
that was an important relationship...
but it's not privileged.
the program is based on anonymity.
it's how we help each other, all right?
now, paul was trying to stay sober. I don't want to make it harder for him.
if you know something, you need to tell me.
don't make me issue a subpoena.
do whatever you have to do.
sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?
I was just describing the brick wall I ran into with Paul Randall's sponsor.
he gave her nothing.
I think I know what he didn't want to tell you.
you brought audio visuals?
surveillance tape of the motor court inn, a lovely little road side motel frequented by none other than one
so he was having an affair.
but how does that connect to our case?
let's watch the enhanced version.
Oh, my god.
he was sleeping with his mother-in-law.
that's just not possible.
I wanted you to know before it comes out in court.
it just doesn't make any sense. I mean an affair?
paul hated her.
so you never saw any signs? You never suspected?
how could I ever imagine my own mother would do that to me?
I'm so sorry.
Jessica, are you sure you're going to be able to handle all this?
Yeah.
Yes.
I'll be fine.
what happens now?
Maureen is at the courthouse now.
we've asked the judge to compel the sponsor to testify.
if he agrees, I want to put him on the stand today.
your honor, you can't let this man testify.
he may have critical information.
it may be critical, but it is also privileged.
now my client confided in this man as part of his recovery.
it's no different than confiding in a priest.
it's very different.
alcoholics anonymous is a treatment program, not a religion.
it is grounded in religion. It's a 12-step program.
step three is turning your life over to the care of god.
whose god?
AA members come in all faiths-- Christian, Jews, Muslims.
and no one has to convert when they join.
your honor, you have the case log.
I refer the court to cox V. Miller, where this privilege was considered and rejected.
it's a second circuit case out of New York.
Yes, and the supreme court affirmed the decision.
well, they never issued a written opinion. There's plenty of room for debate here.
your honor, there are 50, 000 aa chapters in this country, one million members.
we cannot treat everyone like a priest.
if he acted like a priest, we can.
look, your honor, people go to aa for help.
part of that help comes from the spiritual guidance they get by admitting what they did wrong.
now if everything they say is fair game in a court of law, people won't seek treatment.
it's as simple as that.
I understand.
but I have to balance the interests here.
you want alcoholics to get help, the state wants to catch a murderer.
state wins.
I'm allowing the sponsor to testify.
would you say you know the defendant well?
he's one of my closest friends.
you sponsor someone, you go through a lot together.
you confide in each other.
did the defendant ever confide in you about his mother-in-law Helen Brooks?
Yeah.
what did he tell you?
he talked about her all the time, how she would control Jessica, make her feel bad about herself.
did he seem angry?
definitely.
but nothing like he was after.
after what?
the day before the shooting, Paul came to see me.
he was upset, angry.
he was really tempted to drink.
he said he made a mistake, something stupid unforgivable.
and what was that?
he was, uh...
having an affair with his mother-in-law.
it'd been going on for about a month, maybe two.
started after she moved in with them.
you have to understand that just because somebody stops drinking, it doesn't mean they stop behaving like an addict.
you know, we often substitute one thrill for another.
I think that's what he did with her.
he knew it was crazy. He tried to stop it.
but that's when his mother-in-law just got mad.
she threatened to tell Jessica.
he knew if Jessica found out, she would leave him, take his daughter.
he said that Helen seduced him on purpose to end the marriage, ruin his life.
and what did he say he was going to do about that?
the only thing he said is that he had to stop her.
one way or another, it would all soon be over.
no further questions.
Helen Brooks planned to tell Jessica about the affair. Is that what my client told you?
Yes.
assuming that she followed through with that threat, what do you think is more likely, Mr. Brandt, that my client, who never held a gun in his life, suddenly killed Helen brooks, or that Jessica Randall shot her mother in a rage after learning the truth?
Objection!
that was it. Her mother had taken away her life, her home, her daughter, and now her husband.
objection.
Mr. Hellman, that's enough.
stop...
Paul, say something.
Jessica, please.
bailiff.
you slept with my mother.
you killed her. And now, you're blaming me.
what are you?!
she was my mother!
that's a woman scorned, ladies and gentlemen.
it doesn't get much clearer than that.
all right,
I said "enough," counselor. Save it for closing.
ready when you are, your honor.
nothing further.
that was not helpful.
it's crazy what they're saying!
I didn't know anything about what happened until you told me!
I know.
then how can he tell the jury that I knew?
it's a trial, Jessica.
it doesn't have to be true. He's trying to create reasonable doubt.
I want to testify again.
I didn't know. I want the jury to hear me say that.
I understand, but that is a mistake.
all he needs is the possibility that you knew.
you could deny it forever, and he'll say you're lying.
putting you back up there gives Hellman what he wants.
I agree.
it would look desperate.
we cannot have the jury thinking that we're on the defensive.
I can't believe this.
I can't believe that this is my life.
I can't believe that that man was my husband.
Hey.
heard things got a little rough today.
you know the last two words any prosecutor ever wants to hear?
not guilty.
he was good.
I think it all comes down to the closings.
you'll be ready.
maybe.
turns out, I don't have the most sympathetic victim.
Hey.
paul Randall shot the woman he was sleeping with in a cold, deliberate, vicious way.
I don't care who Helen Brooks was.
he deserves to go to prison for the rest of his life.
think about Jessica.
one day, she's taking care of her family, the next, her life's blown apart.
I mean, her mother's dead, her marriage is over, her six-year-old wants to know why daddy's not coming home.
sounds like her life was less than perfect before that day.
Helen Brooks was 48.
other than a few headaches, she was in good health.
she had time, maybe 30, 40 years ahead of her.
now don't get me wrong, in many ways, her life was a mess.
she was hypercritical, hurtful, disrespectful, and as I stand here,I can't imagine how or why she could sleep with her daughter's husband.
but I do know this.
was brutally murdered.
paul Randall shot her in the most cold-blooded, premeditated way possible.
you heard Jessica's testimony.
she saw Paul walk into her room.
he was perfectly calm.
he wanted Helen dead.
Why?
you heard Michael Brandt, his sponsor, tell you why.
in Paul's mind, his life was over.
if Helen told Jessica the truth, Paul knew Jessica would leave him.
he was angry.
he thought Helen set him up, that she seduced him on purpose as a way to destroy his family.
and if his life was over, so was hers.
now we gave you forensics.
the bullet trajectory proves the shooter was at least six feet tall.
think about that.
it's a devastating fact, a fact that the defense can't live with.
no matter what it takes, the defense will not let you focus on the evidence.
so what do they do?
they get desperate.
they come up with some ridiculous theory about the victim pressing down the remote after she was shot.
this is absurd.
this is a creative defense lawyer on the ropes grasping for any argument he can find.
thank you, Mrs. Chase, but I'm not that clever.
truth is, it doesn't take a lot of vision to see what happened here.
Jessica Randall hated her mother.
now we know that because she said so to anyone who would listen.
she lived her whole life dealing with constant criticism, constant disapproval.
and on top of that, her mother slept with her husband.
now can you imagine that rage?
you open your life and your home to your mother, the one person on earth who's supposed to love you more than anyone else, and that happens.
killed her mother.
she bought the gun, she learned how to shoot it.
you heard the state's expert.
one squeeze, one reflexive squeeze on that remote control, and the shooter could be as short as five-foot-five.
did that happen?
I submit that it did.
but even if you're not sure, the burden is on the state to prove that it didn't happen.
we do have the burden.
and that's why I want you to think about the blood.
had blood on his shirt.
the victim's blood.
ask yourselves:
how did that happen?
if Jessica Randall shot her mother, how is it that Paul was the only one with any sign of blood on him?
what do you think?
you did the best you could.
it's out of our hands now.
you think they'll deliberate for a while?
probably.
they have a lot to discuss.
okay, honest opinion, no hedging.
you think we did enough?
Yes.
you?
it's hard to say.
I mean, I think I made a connection with most of the jurors, but there was one who wouldn't make eye contact with me.
she makes me nervous.
but my gut tells me, we made our case, and the jury's going to see that.
you're serious?
as her example?
what? It's not that much of a stretch.
right.
so, waiting for the verdict in a murder case is like taking a home pregnancy test.
Yeah.
I mean, you really want to know the results, but you're scared to look, 'cause it's a huge moment.
you don't want to be disappointed.
what?
you asked me what it was like, I gave you an example.
I didn't say it was genius.
staring at the phone won't make it ring.
the jury's been deliberating for hours.
if they don't come back with a verdict soon, chances are, we lost.
hello.
Yes, speaking.
I don't understand.
now?
well, what's going on? Do we have a verdict?
okay. Thank you.
what?
that was judge Meyers' clerk.
he wants to see everybody in chambers right away.
Why?
the jury has a question.
so?
before they put someone away for murder, they need some more information.
they have a question about Jessica.
sorry to bring you down at this hour.
I know it's late, so I'll get right to it.
at 7: 06 this evening, the jury foreman approached a bailiff.
he handed him this note.
judge, we have a question.
we took a vote and would like to hear from another witness.
can you call Jessica Randall's therapist to the stand?
I think it's a great idea.
I'm sure you do, but it's completely out of the question.
Jessica's therapist, that's what they're focusing on?
it doesn't matter. The evidence is already closed.
well, now, hang on a minute.
if that's what the jury wants to hear don't push it, Doug.
you've twisted the truth enough in this trial.
I'm not about to open an innocent woman's health records so you can make it worse.
your honor, did they say why? Why the therapist?
I read the note.
that's all we have.
I'm instructing the foreman to continue deliberations.
this is disaster. Calm down.
why do you think they want to hear from the therapist? They have a doubt, Maureen.
they think Jessica might be crazy enough to kill her mother.
we don't know that.
it could just be a question.
it's not just a question.
they're focused on Jessica's mental state.
the fact that she's in therapy made an impact.
not to mention her outburst in court.
okay,
I know it looks bad, but...
ladies, never a dull moment.
looks like you two hit a bump in the road.
not necessarily.
Oh, come on, you know what this means.
the jury's having doubts.
they're not asking to hear more about my client.
they're looking at the wife.
Doug, what do you want?
same thing I wanted at the start of the trial
eight years.
forget it.
you're holding on to this too tight.
you've lost.
take the eight.
no.
if I win, Paul Randall goes free.
you want to risk that?
might want to talk to Jessica about that.
we'll get back to you.
eight years?
it's not enough, we know.
but if the jury finds him not guilty, he goes free.
I don't understand.
what does the jury's question mean?
we don't know.
maybe nothing.
maybe they asked because they just want to be thorough.
or...
maybe they're focusing in on you as the more likely suspect.
what do you think?
I think the question is probably bad for us.
if we lose, he could be out and free this afternoon.
I understand, but I don't know what to think about anything anymore.
I've trusted you the whole way. You know what's best.
I know it's your decision.
if you think we can win, let's go to the verdict.
if you don't, let's take the deal.
so, what's the plan?
I don't know.
Hellman's good, but he pushes it.
I don't think the jury believed him.
they don't need to.
all he needs is a little doubt.
look, I know it's hard, but this is what it means to try cases.
you don't get any answers. It's all about trusting your instinct.
what would you do?
you really want to know?
from what I've heard,
I'd take the deal.
I couldn't watch Jessica's face when her husband walked out a free man.
but that's me.
I'd take it, too.
Jessica has a daughter.
if the jury kicks Paul, he could get joint custody.
are you sure you want to do this?
Yes, your honor.
very well.
as you know, a plea of guilty may be entered any time before the verdict has been read.
your honor, at this time, my client wishes to withdraw his not guilty plea, and accept the state's offer of eight years.
so entered.
I'll inform the jury they're no longer needed.
and we are adjourned.
you did the right thing.
Thanks.
thank you.
I know you did everything you could.
Hey, what happened?
excuse me?
I was on the jury.
Oh, right. Hi.
we were deliberating, and all of a sudden, the bailiff came in and said we were dismissed.
Yeah. I'm sorry. That happens sometimes.
the defendant decided to plead guilty.
you're kidding.
no, he entered a plea this morning.
Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.
I mean, we all knew he was guilty.
you did?
Yeah. I mean, come on.
was that defense attorney desperate or what?
that thing about Helen squeezing the remote after she was shot? Please!
nobody bought that.
uh, what about the therapist? You asked that question.
Oh. There was this one woman on the jury.
she wanted to know what the therapist knew about their marriage.
we asked the question to make her happy.
we were filling out the verdict form when the bailiff came in to stop us.
great.
so, what he get, how many years?
eight.
that's all?
Wow.
that doesn't seem like much for what he did.
but I guess that's how it goes, huh?
Annabeth, got a minute?
sure.
well, you tried a good case.
I just wanted to tell you that.
I won, you know.
I ran into the foreman.
gave me that.
they were about to find your client guilty.
I knew I had it,
I knew the jury was with me. I just didn't trust my instincts.
well, that's what I was counting on.
I knew I couldn't win.
I knew you had to give it away.
when I said I only needed one person to have a doubt, I didn't mean a juror.
I meant you.
Oh, come on.
come on, it's just a bad beat. It's good to win again.
get on the ground!
come on! On your knees!
stomach on the ground!
Connor Bradley, a freshman in the university.
3. 8 gpa.
business major. - And he robs a bank?
on his way to the movies with some friends.
how much did he rob of? - $1, 237.
that's barely enough for popcorn.
computer techs say he was playing a lot of online poker.
he spent all his cash in half term, and he could not ask his parents for it.
he's addicted.
there's nothing to stop you gambling on a computer, except your cash flow.
is there anything you want to tell us?
I keep my cards in three-dimensional space.
so is this an armed robbery, or is he just a sweet-talker?
if you call this sweet talk.
give me all your money, and you won't get hurt.
she thought he had a gun.
we recover any of the loot? - No.
all right, let's set up some initial interviews with the friends in the car, their parents...
their parents are coming infrom Missouri. - Oh, no.
nothing is much terrible like that, "hi, mom, I'm in jail." phone call.
college student robbed a bank.
Yeah, what is that, some kind of independent study?
on the robbery charge, how does the defendant plead?
not guilty, your honor, and given that no weapon or money has been discovered...
your honor, this defendant has shown a willingness to threaten the livesof innocent strangers.
bail is setat $50, 000.
defendants can be bailed, but they are not allowed to return to Missouri or to drive. They are not allowed to use other computers except after using computers in libraries.
will at least one parent remain in Indiana until trial?
Yes, your honor. - So ordered. Next case.
so it's ten percentof $50, 000?
that's right. - How soon?
you post the bond, I'll get the paperwork rolling.
you could have him backat your hotel by supper. - Thank you.
I assume you're not filling their heads with false hope.
my goal was to get this family back together.
and your goal for tomorrow?
how's 11: 00 A. M?
two years, plus mandatory treatment for his gambling addiction, and a full confession with financial restitution.
wait a minute. I have to confess?
we have talked about this.
confession of guilt before the judge is part of any arrangement.
you know, I just thought...
I thought I could keep my parents from having to go through a trial.
Connor, we're here today to decide your future.
we need to make a deal today, or your future is ruined.
I can't make a confession in front of my parents. It will kill them.
the jury is gonna see you on that tape robbing the bank.
they won't care about what your parents think.
I can't do it.
Mr. Bradley, we have it on tape.
Yeah, well, we've seen the tape, and it's a blurry mess, with somebody, who in our opinion doesn't look like Connor.
were you know your son spent many hours gambling over the internet?
Yes, Connor told me about it.
but he also said that he quit doing it last semester.
it was his first time away from home. He made a mistake.
and he's about to make another one.
you need to pressure him to take this deal.
he thinks he's letting you down.
do you really want a full-blown trial, landing him in jailfor four years, 500 miles from Joplin, Missouri?
maybe we should hear all the options.
he gave me his word that he did not rob that bank.
Mr. Bradley, this is a list of the students who went with your son to the movies that day.
do you understand?
the jury has no reason to doubt any of them.
four friends of his placing him at the scene.
that's their business.
all right, let's be clear then. We were willing to deal.
it doesn't mean we'll go easy on him at trial--quite the opposite.
they're all yours. I have witnesses to interview.
central Indiana State University Snapping Turtles
Kaitlin, the other passengers in the car that day describe Connoras quiet and withdrawn.
is that accurate? - Yeah.
do you have any idea what was going on with him?
no, but I thought that going to the movies might cheer him up.
did he ever talk to you about money? - No.
but you're close with him, right?
I mean, we were friends.
Kelly Yunrun was in the car that day, right?
Yes.
he told me Connor has feelings for you.
I guess like a crush;nothing serious.
we're really good friends.
I had no idea that he was gonna robbing a bank.
Oh, excuse me.
Hey, Ray. What's up?
there is a long distance from the side of the road.
Plus, no skid marks. - The bike wasn't mangled up.
guy's out on bailfor three days, and he just happensto be the victimof a hit-and-run?
body is frozen. He's been.out here at least overnight.
why did his parents wait a day to report him missing?
they were trying to find him on their own.
they didn't want him getting in any more trouble.
his windpipe was crushed, and the neck fractures were inconsistent with any kind of fallfrom a bicycle.
he was choked to death.
and there are some minor scrapes on the back of his hands.
all of this happened on the roadside?
lividity shows up on his back, but he was found on his side, so he was moved.
what about time of death? - About four hours of decomposition.
but then he was dumped in nearly freezing temperatures, so...
so if he went missing on Tuesday, and turned upon Wednesday?
it means he could have been killed pretty much any time within that two-day spread.
sorry. But it's not all bad news.
what? - This came from the lab.
fiber? - Found it in the bike gears.
it's on car upholstery.
it's not every day your defendant becomes a murder victim.
we were just getting started. We hadn't even figured out why he robbed a bank.
the kid is an honor student, no history of any kind of trouble.
well, what do the police have so far?
well, you know how it goes. They start from the murder scene, and work out from there.
do you think we should stick with the robbery case, it gives us a leg up?
at least talk to his parents before they go back to Missouri.
and you still think he didn't act alone?
maybe now that he's dead, people will be willing to talk more.
Yeah.
where are you going?
I got to pick up my daughter at the airport.
Oh, that's great.
that's not great?
Jessie got, uh, early acceptanceat college, and since then, she's been blowing off the last half of her senior year.
I remember that.
we probably put too much pressure on her, right?
and, uh, she achieved her goal, and now she's letting loose.
sounds like she needs a little quality time with her dad.
Yeah, that's what her mother thought, too.
but you don't?
Jessie is a bright, articulate, independent, stubborn person, just like her mom.
and someone else I know.
I only stay a few minutes. My husband doesn't know that I'm here.
I understand.
after he turned down the deal and came back to our hotel, Connor told me that he robbed that bank.
I see.
did he say where the money was? - No.
did he say why he robbed the bank?
no, and he begged me not to tell his dad until he got back.
got back from where? - I should have neverlet him go.
just tell me what happened.
he said that he needed to straighten some things out.
I told him I'd haveto drive him, but he said that I needed to trust him...
so I let him go.
where was your husband at the time?
he was out getting food for us.
and what time did your son leave?
it was around 3: 00 in the afternoon.
okay.
how was he killed?
he was choked to death.
and then he was left outside for almost a day and a half.
Kaitlin, his mom said the last time she talked to him, he said he hadsome things to straighten out.
do you have any idea what he was talking about?
well, you know he gambled online. -We know.
no.
I mean, he played poker with a bunch of guys in reality.
no one has ever mentioned that before.
that's because the game is exclusive, invitation only.
one of the rules is that you can't talk about it.
are you saying he robbed a bank so he could keep playing poker?
I wouldn't know.
but you knew about the game. Did you play there, too?
not exactly. - Answer the question, please.
look...
I know who runs the game, and I'm afraid of him.
Why?
because the last time I saw him...
he twisted my arm behind my back and slammed me up against a wall.
why would he do that?
because I was breaking up with him.
what's his name? - Bryce Gibson.
you know mom always makes everything sound 10 times worse than what really happened.
don't even try it, Jessie. Your mother and I are on the same page on this problem.
it was Chelsea's birthday.
you were gone all night, no phone call.
I forgot my cell phone. - You forgot it, or you left it on purpose?
let's talk about your grades, too. - They're not that bad.
Jessica, a c in calculus? For anyone else, that's okay.
for you, it's an embarrassment.
dad, I'm going to be an English major.
look, just because Boston college gave you early admission doesn't mean they won't change their mind and drop you tomorrow.
maybe I should look at schools here from now.
in Indiana? - Notre Dame was always my second choice.
have you talked to your mother about this?
do you not want me to go to school nearby? - That's not what I'm saying, you know that.
Hey, Ray.
I thought that was you. - Hi.
wow, you look great. - Thanks!
you, uh, staying long?
talk to your supervisor.
actually, boss, Ed is already waiting for us upstairs.
this won't take long. - I'm going to stay here.
promise not to embarrass you. Bye, Ray.
Bryce gibson, junior at Central State, lives in a house with his dad.
his parents are divorced.
what connects this guy to the victim?
they played poker at Gibson's place, according to Gibson's ex.
Yeah, poker and this.
it is recovered from the victim's bike gears.
we took the liberty of doing a drive-by Gibson's house, and noticed he had a brand-new car, which led us to the one he traded in.
traded in the day after the victim went missing.
it made our job a lot easier that he no longer owned the car.
there's no way he can contest the grounds for the search.
this fiber matched the interior upholstery.
nothing dumber than a smart criminal, huh?
luminoled the floor boards. Came back with some human dna, but the lab is still working on that.
we know the body was moved, and from paint dust found on the back of the victim's hand, it looks like a fight that happened indoors somewhere.
Gibson loads the body and the bicycle into his car and drives into the country to dump the evidence.
what's the time of death?
victim's mother was the last person to see him--Tuesday at 3: 00 P. M.
when we recovered the body on Thursday, it was frozen, with only about four hours decomposition.
so we don't know when the body was dumped.
going over Dr. Smith's report, something jumped out.
see that dust in the snow on his arm?
it snowed Tuesday night at 8: 00 P. M. for about an hour.
and that's the last time it snowed, until the day he was found.
so it likely the body was left outside on Tuesday evening.
good. What do we know about the poker game?
not much.
the kids aren't anxious to let the parents know they're players.
so we're going through the campus gamblers anonymously.
beause we think someone there might want to get back at Gibson.
what about the "anonymous" thing?
they're going to make an announcement.
on the surface, it is a survey of the moral and financial situation of seniors.
we don't have time for that.
let's arrest Gibson right away, before he has time to hide any more evidence.
Marion County Jail
Connor lost money, but it wasn't in like the thousands of dollars.
just a friendlycollege poker game. - It's a $2. 00 limit, texas hold 'em.
we've been told the game was so exclusive, players were sworn to secrecy.
I don't know where you heard that. - Your ex-girlfriend, Kaitlin Howard.
my ex-girlfriend? - News to you?
she's making things up. - Like you throwing her against a wall?
can we confine this to questions about the alleged victim, please?
was Connor a regular player? - He played maybe...
I don't know, six times since school started.
and the two of you never got into any kind of fight?
never.
so how did fibers from the victim's bike gears come from a vehicle you once owned?
my client often gave the alleged victim rides homefrom his house.
after poker, when it was too cold for him to ride his bike, we just threw it in the back.
that's considerate.
where were you on Tuesday afternoon?
I was at home until my mom picked me up.
and what time was that? - About 4: 00, I don't remember exactly.
we go to dinner on Tuesdays. - At 4: 00?
my mom likes to watch her money very carefully.
we get the early bird.
watching sports is about the only thing that gets my mind off poker.
actually, the best part of a GA meeting is that we can talk about gambling.
what about Bryce Gibson's game? - Serious stuff, no limit pots.
how big?
thousand bucks a game, last time I played there.
yeah? When was that?
wait a minute.
I thought we were just talking about Bryce. - You agreed to meet with us.
if you wind up giving us nothing...
we might think you have something to hide.
last time I played at Gibson's, I accused him of cheating.
you caught him?
he had this pattern I couldn't figure out for the longest time. It was like ...
a built-in pause before he made his bets, you know?
like he was waiting on final instructions.
and then I realized, he's wearing a wire.
did you actually see the wire? - You think I'm still blaming himfor my losses?
I've already been through this in meeting.
look, if he wasn't cheating, then why had he throw me out of the room?
physically? - Yeah.
I mean, maybe I shouldn't have said it in front of everyone, but...
where exactly do these games take place?
at a round table in the living room in the basement.
we've been through his place. There's no round table in the basement.
I don't know what to say.
but Bryce is the one who's got something to hide.
so Gibson's dad live supstairs; Where's mom?
she lives in Hendricks county.
they're divorced.
where is this supposed table?
used to be something here.
Oh, look what we have here.
safety first.
somebody tore the guts out of this.
I think it looks like the interior of the smoke detector.
what do you know?
I wonder who was on the other end of that.
we found the tale upsairs in the dad's place.
there's a camerain the ceiling. Check this out.
this thing has an infrared light hidden underneath, shining through the smoked glass top.
you can't see anything because it's invisible to your eye.
so any card lying facedown would be visible to the pinhole camera above.
Hey, I'll take that hand.
okay, for this to work, somebody would have to monitor what the camera was getting and relay it back to Gibson at the table.
the other end of the cable came out in the spare bedroom upstairs.
so his dad must have at least known what he was up to.
maybe he also knows what happened to Connor Bradley.
that's strange.
I bought the house this past year and never noticed that.
maybe the previous owners were security conscious.
we also found a table rigged to help your son cheat at cards, that had been moved to your part of the house.
the police, all sorts.of people have been...
they are in the house for days, moving everything around.
I'm in a hotel myself-- I can't even go home.
so it comes as a complete shock to you that your son was running a quickie game.in your basement?
first of all...
I'm gone much of the time.
I'm the tri-state manager for a group of insurance brokers.
second: You're right, it is my basement.
but it's also a completely separate apartment, and I try to give Bryce his privacy-- he is in college after all.
but you were around Wednesday to co-sign on a car loan?
I got back that morning.
I had promised Bryce a new vehicle a couple months ago.
his old one had a series of problems. It really wasn't worth fixing.
it likes some torn upholstery.
I wasn't aware of that.
you weren't aware that your son had used the vehicle to transport a bicycle and a dead body the day before?
I highly doubt that to be the case, since my son was with my ex-wife that evening.
she picks him up at 4: 00 every tTuesday. Believe me, she's very strict about that.
you're not on good terms?
we were in business together.
it went bankrupt. Very ugly. She blames me for all of it.
I picked Bryce up at 3: 00 so we could go to dinner.
so now it's 3: 00?
your husband's statement says 4: 00. Your son's statement says 4: 00. What happened to 4: 00?
well, because that's when it normally is, but I remember it specifically, because I came by early that Tuesday.
for what reason?
I wanted him to put up some shelves in my office.
Bryce is good with that sort of thing.
the name of the restaurant? - Metro grill on market street.
when you picked him up, did you go in to his basement apartment?
I called Bryce from the car and told him I was out front.
I don't like running into my ex-husband, if I can help it.
I'm sorry he got involved in that.
if he was living with me, it never would have happened.
but just because my husband was negligent, that doesn't mean Bryce killed someone.
I don't know what I'm looking at.
that's the victim's DNA. We found it in your son's car.
well, Bryce had many friends.
it's also the DNA we found on a scrape on the wall in your son's apartment.
take a good look. That's another.mother's son.
Denham's going to make the boys' connection seem as innocent as possible, and then hammer at the alibi.
if Connor left his house at 3: 00.
and Gibson was on his way to dinner at that time, we do have a problem.
but metro grill only has mother and son from 4: 30 to 6: 30.
what do you think Denham's going to do with a missing hour and a half?
I think Gibson was helping his mother move the bookshelf at the speed of slide.
wait a minute.
Denham's putting Mrs. Gibson up to talk about the alibi, right?
right.
why don't we do the same thing with the dad, but do it first?
we get him to deny all the gambling stuff, where he's completely unbelievable, then switch him to the alibi.
so it all feels like a lie. - Work with the strengths, I say.
speaking of which, how's Scott Payce holding up?
solid, paints Gibson as a hothead when it comes to covering the cheating.
what about Kaitlin?
a little scared of her ex-boyfriend still, but she'll get through it.
he used her fear.
it's the best emotional connection we have to prove Gibson's violent side.
typically, in choke holds, the forearm compresses the neck and occludes the upper airway, which cuts off oxygen to the brain.
is that what happened here?
in this case, the hold was applied with such force that it fractured the larynx and hyoid bone.
in other words, his neck was broken. - That's correct.
this caused spinal shock, which immediately shut down his breathing - he was dead within seconds. - No further questions, your honor.
aren't choke holds most effective when the person performing the hold has the heightand weight advantage?
in a general sense.
what was the victim's height? - Six-foot, 170 pounds.
your honor, I'd like to submit into evidence, my client's height: 5'10," weight: 163 pounds.
if this were a college wrestling match up...
your honor, it wasn't a college wrestling match up.
sustained.
one last thing: We heard earlier from you about how the time of death was determined by the Tuesday nightsnowfall, is that correct?
Yes.
did you ever consider that whoever placed this bodyby the side of the road might have tried to cover it up with snow, thereby making it possible that it could have.been placed there at any point between the snowfall and discovery?
it never came up. - Thank you.
Dr. Schmidt, can.you think of a reason why it never came up?
probably because there was no more than one inch of snow reported for that evening.
can't even make a snowball out of that. - Objection, your honor.
to what? The weather?
the first week, there'd be a bunch of new players.
they'd do pretty good their first time out.
that was Bryce's way of hooking them in to the game.
objection, your honor. Speculation. - Sustained.
what happened after the first week?
the second week, everyone would do a little worse.
and then, by the third week, Bryce would completely wipe them out.
and the next week? - He'd start all over again.
the last time you played at Bryce Gibson's, you were thrown out--is that correct?
Yep. - By Bryce Gibson himself?
Yeah. - Why?
I accused him of cheating.
and what did he say to you when he physically ejected you?
he told me that if I went around telling anyone that he was cheating, that he would beat the blank out of me. - No more questions, your honor.
Mr. Denham? - Nothing, your honor.
the witness may step down. Ms. Chase, next witness.
what's up? - Kaitlin's a no-show.
I knew she was shaky, but I didn't think she was this shaky.
I think we should move up Gibson's dad.
back so soon?
I was just going to show Jess what happens when college kids go bad.
Oh, the judge wanted an early lunch break.
how's your trip so far? - It's pretty fun.
indiana isn't nearly as dull as my dad said it was.
sorry, we have to work.
you sure everything's okay? - Everything is under control.
ms. Chase, this came while you were out. - Thank you.
okay, you called Ray. - I'll start calling her relatives.
okay.
on our way. - Maureen, look at this. It's all money.
Connor was going to give this back. Kaitlin.
I'm guessing$1, 200 and change. - That was the clerk.
judge Lathrop wants us in chambers. - Rains, it pours.
anything you want to tell me?
when we broke for lunch, I got into an elevator with the last witness.
he was talking on his phone and he was saying that everything he said on the stand, he was making it up.
did you know or suspect your witness was lying?
of course not, your honor.
Mrs. Stottlemeyer, what did you do after overhearing the witness say he was lying?
I told paul here about it.
and what did you do, paul? - I told two other jurors.
then we decided we'd better come up here and tell you.
so a total of four jurors? - Yes.
thank you for your honesty.
in light of these developments, ladies and gentlemen, I am declaring a mistrial.
that means you can go.
I deposed Scott Payce. His story was not made up.
this whole thing stinks.
obviously, somebody got to him.
what about the money from Kaitlin? Did it check out at the bank?
every last serial number.
any idea why she didn't give it up earlier?
Connor must have given it to her to hide.
when he died, she probably got scared we'd think she was in on it.
was she? - I don't know.
we haven't been able to track her down yet.
of course, receiving money from her makes you a material witness when we start a new trial.
I haven't thought of that, actually.
first things first, though: Who tampered with Scott Payce?
Denham's annoying, but not dirty.
Gibson's dad, though, definitely likes to game the system.
you mean he likes to cheat. - We never proved that.
we need to diginto this character's financial background and we need to useobstruction of justice to do it.
we think somebody paid you off. - No.
nobody approached you before the trial?
nobody approached me before the trial.
nobody gave you any money? - Nobody gave me any money.
perjury starts at three months and goes all the way to two-year jail time.
look, I didn't lie, all right? My testimony is the same as it was in the deposition.
you want to be a smart-assor tell the truth?
look, I was on the phone with a friend, okay?
we were kidding around. It was, like, a joke.
I didn't know that there were any jurors on the elevator.
and besides, I'm in recovery, so I'm not really responsible sometimes.
are we done? I'm going to be late for class.
so Joe Gibson's insurance company... - yeah?
it involves him visiting nursing homes all around the midwest.
there is no doubt that he is promoting a careful and safe retirement plan.
he sells deferred annuities from a reliable company.
that doesn't sound so bad. - Yeah, but I did some calling around.
it turns out when he shows up to meet with these people, he abruptly switches financial products and sells them a supposedly better one.
Ah, but it's not better. - 40% early withdrawal penalty, anyone?
daddy steals from little old ladies. - Technically, but not legally.
this guy is really good at keeping his nose clean.
on the bright side, I looked into Kaitlin's school records.
she's not a rich kid, She lives upon academic scholarship.
that's nice, but how does that help us find her?
it's mid-term week at the university.
I figure she might skip court - but she won't skip a mid-term.
I helped Bryce with the poker games.
helped him cheat? - I knew about it.
it just didn't seem right for me to get up there and say stuff about him when I was a part of it.
how big a part?
I'd meet new players and I'd bring them over to play.
like recruiting? - In a way.
that's how I met Connor.
he was such a sweet guy.
did you have feelings for him?
Bryce found out. That's why we broke up.
he said that if Connor and I ever got together, he'd kill him.
and you believed him.
you know what he's capable of.
did you tell Connor that you'd broken up?
he found out. He was all over me.
but then I got really scared for him, and I panicked and I lied.
I made up this story that I...
that I got kicked out of school because I was behind on tuition.
I just thought that...
that if I pushed him away I could protect him, you know?
and do you know what he does for me?
what? - He robs a bank.
do you know what that's like?
to have someone do that for you? - Why did you keep the money?
I was in shock.
all this happened based on a stupid lie.
and before I could figure out how to handle it, he was arrested.
but I did tell him the truth when he got out on bail.
I told him about the lie, about cheating, about everything.
how did he take it?
well...
actually, that'S...
that's when we got together.
you slept with him? - It just happened.
I just think everything was out in the open.
we were going to give the money back, we were going to tell the police it was all my fault.
Kaitlin, he was still a bank robber. He was still going to jail.
we knew that. But we had a plan to come clean with everybody, to start over.
that's why he wanted to go to bryce'S. To tell him he knew about the cheating.
and then he wanted to tell Bryce face-to-face that he was in love with me.
and he never came back.
I begged him not to go.
but he promised me that everything would turn out fine if we just told the truth.
this thing better work with my dish.
come on! The fight starts at 3: 00, let's go.
it looks heavy.
maybe you should take a break and set it down.
he said nobody gave him any money, but...
there's more ways then cash to a college boy's heart.
so I got him with a giantplasma TV, not much else.
you don't know where it came from?
tracked it back to the store, but their records show a cash sale.
does he know that? - No.
that's good.
we know who gave you that television.
nobody gave it to me, I bought it myself.
with what?
your checking accounthas a $65 high for the past three months.
the store came up with the receipt.
and the guy who bought it for you is gonna be booked on obstructionof justice charges.
you're next.
you're bluffing.
what makes you so sure? - I'm beyond sure.
if you want anything from me, I want a promise that I'm not gonna be chargedwith anything.
we'll think about it.
and I also don't want my parents to find out, either.
all right? I'm in enough trouble as it is. - Let's see if it checks out.
you said some "guy.
it wasn't a guy.
it was a woman. Who?
Gibson's mom.
she told me if I lied in front of some jurors, there'd be a TV waiting for me, bought and paid for.
so you alone today?
Yeah, Jessie went up to Notre Dame. - By herself?
that's the way she likes.
what's her mom think about all this?
she thinks I'm trying to steal her away from her.
but you're not.
you know, the way that kid is all over the place these days, I'm thinking maybe I should.
where are we with Patricia Gibson?
we've got Payce's confession, we got the plasma TV, but we don't have a receipt leading directly to her, so we're getting a search warrant for her house.
what about her work? - Works at home.
runs a non-profit that steers kids into college.
what kind of kids? - Kids having trouble in high school.
maybe she could give me a couple points. - Yeah, you could use them.
it's not my fault that one of your witnesses lied in court.
no, but Scott Payce didn't lie in court, he lied after, in front of jurors, and that was your fault.
I have to say, looking around here, your organization seems to exist on paper only.
Oh, no, those contain confidential student records.
Really? They look like financial records to me.
you applying for a federal grant? $500, 000?
that's a whole lot of grant.
before they got divorced, the Gibsons had a successful vitamin supply business.
Where's the bankruptcy come from? - That's the beauty part.
they get divorced, he transfers all his assets to his ex-wifein the settlement, - and then declares bankruptcy. - You think they divorced for convenience?
they're not exactly Ozzie and Harriet. - More like Bonnie and Clyde.
I think we might have an answer as to where the gambling profits went.
okay.
it's just a theory, but, uh, take a look at these bank records.
how many non-profitsdo you know regularly take in $6, 000, $7, 000 in donations, that get deposited like clockwork on Monday morning?
right after the poker weekend.
so Joe Gibson helps his kidcheat at cards, and then his kid sends the profits over to Momto hide in her fake business.
it also makes mom look legit on paper, so that she can apply for a half million dollar federal grant.
your average American family.
with a whole lot to lose when their son commits a murder.
illegal gambling, fraudulent non-profit, covering up a murder
that's quite a list.
I haven't done anything wrong.
as we speak, your son is making a deal to put you away.
I thought you might want to spread the love.
he wouldn't do such a thing. - But that's how you raised him, isn't it?
look out for number one. I've got mine, now give me yours.
he'll be the star witness at your trial.
we know you had nothing to do with hiding the body.
so why am I here?
there's the matter of illegal gambling, bilking senior citizens...
it was your wife who tampered with the witness, wasn't it?
you wouldn't do something like that.
so why go away for it?
it was all Joe's doing. - I thought he was out of townon business.
in Illinois, an hour away.
I called him when I got to Bryce's.
there was this dead boy.
and joe said, "go to dinner."
get out of the house, he would take care of everything, and he did.
your mom and dad aren't really divorced, are they? - That's ridiculous.
the three of you lived and worked together as a family.
only not one anyone on the outside could see. - You have nothing to prove this.
we have a direct connection from your client's illegal gaming to his mother's fraudulent business.
what I'm proposing to you is a deal for voluntary manslaughter.
ten years for something he didn't even do? - I'm not done.
we'll take off two years if you testify to your mother's role in the cover-up, and another two for your father.
let me ask you this:
you ever wonder why your dad used your car to dump the body, instead of his own?
I wanted to call the cops, all right? - My mom said no.
he came over to tell me that he and Kaitlin were together.
I said I didn't care.
and then he said he would tell everybody about the card game.
about the cheating.
and that's when the fight started.
I grabbed him around his neck, and the next thing I know, he's on the floor.
it was an accident.
that may be, Mr. Gibson, but your actions that followed were not accident.
the defendants are remanded to the state's custody for the term set forth in their plea agreements.
this has been a nice trip. I like here.
does that mean you made a decision about school?
I'm going to Boston.
good.
well, you made the right choice.
Yeah, I received a wake-up call with notre dame this morning.
Oh, yeah? How so?
they took one look at my recent grades and put me on a waiting list.
well, I hope this motivates you to get your act together.
academically speaking.
obviously, I can do better.
well, for the record, Jessica, it's been great having you here.
and I just wish that, um...
when you moved here, you promised to visit me every month.
Yeah.
how many times have you come to visit? - Twice.
maybe you should get your act together on that.
well, obviously, I can do better.
Hey, congratulations.
six years for Gibson, four years for each parent.
triple play. - I had a lot of help.
Hey, where's Jessie? I wanted to say good-bye.
Oh, you missed her. I just drove her to the airport.
so what's the verdict?
Boston college. - That must be a relief.
that's not a relief?
I don't know, I guess I'm worried about her-- you know...
all the trouble college kids seem to get into these days.
tell me about it. - Kind of loving having her here, you know.
you know, when my parents split up and my dad left the house,
I started dating a race car driver.
What?!
it was for nearly a month, and he was a teenage race car driver-- little cars.
but that sure got my dad's attention.
you think that's what this about?
I think they're always testing us, right from the beginning.
well, that might explain the constant sense of failure.
how old is Hayley? - 19 months.
Yeah, well, you should know then, right?
all right, I gonna get home to that.
good night. - Good night.
Oh, by the way...
not one word to Maureen about the... - the race cardriver?
Oh, don't worry, I'm saving that for later.
what happened between us did more than just "hurt" me that night
dear Ellen, Wish I could make you understand go back and change everything.
Tim, Would you be willing to meet me to discuss it? Ellen the police said because of the statute of limitations, there was nothing they could do.
in Indiana, rape is a B felony, which means charges have to be brought within five years.
I'm sorry for wasting your time.
no, no, no, stay. Tell me what happened.
it was the first and last frat party I ever went to.
it was 11 years ago.
I was a freshman, very naive.
he was a senior.
seemed like a nice guy.
we'd been dancing and talking.
and then suddenly I felt really lightheaded, like I was going to faint.
I think he must have slipped something in my drink.
what happened next?
I told him I wasn't feeling well.
and he said he would get his coat and walk me back to my dorm.
we went up to his room...
and then he locked the door.
he... he pushed me down on the bed.
he pinned my arms above my head and tore my clothes off, and then he raped me.
did you call for help?
I screamed and screamed like an animal till I had no voice left.
but the music was too loud, no one could hear me.
and then I realized no one was going to come help me.
I wanted to die.
and then I must have passed out.
what's the next thing you remember?
I woke up the next morning shivering.
I was naked, and he was actually sleeping in the bed next to me, like we were some happy couple.
I just got my clothes, ran home and showered.
you realize you destroyed any physical evidence, DNA?
I thought about that afterwards, but I was just...
I was so in shock. I felt so dirty, I just had to.
did you report him to the police?
I went to the university provost but he told me that if I wanted to file a complaint, that O'neil would have to present in order to defend himself.
and at that time, I just...
I didn't have the strength to face him or to go to the police.
I do now. But I can't even bring charges...
if Mr. O'neil slipped something in your drink, that makes it A class a felony, no statute of limitations.
then I want to press charges.
why now after all this time?
because he wrote me a letter.
he wrote you a letter apologizing for raping you.
he said he wanted to make amends.
he's in some 12-step program and this is the ninth step.
owning up to all the harmful things you did before you were sober.
I mean, I've heard a lot of I'm so sorry,
but not a single for raping you.
he's smart enough not to expose himself to further criminal liability if he can help it.
so after the letter, you exchanged e-mails for a month and then agreed to meet him for coffee?
I was trying to get him to admit what he'd done.
you know, to say it straight out.
over the years, other than the provost, who else have you told about this?
I never told anyone.
not even my husband, not until I got his letter.
how did your husband react?
he was hurt that I kept it a secret from him all this time.
and shocked, because he had known Tim O'neil in college.
why didn't you ever tell him?
I didn't want to be thought of as damaged.
I just wanted to be me, not a victim.
and I was managing fine up until a month ago.
if Tim O'neil really wants to make amends, he can do it from a jail cell.
11 years, no corroboration, no forensics, no evidence.
O'neil's letter is practically a confession.
a good defense attorney can make the distance between practically and actually seem as wide as the gulf of Mexico.
making amends? He made her relive the rape all over again.
he felt guilty, got something off his chest, and now he feels better and her life is in turmoil.
we could at least look in to settling the statute of limitations issue, and talk to whomever we can find who was there that night.
all right.
we'll have ray talk to Mr. O'neil.
maybe he can get him to say something we can use.
I sent her the letter, but I never expected to hear back from her.
it's just something that I had to do.
but then she sent me an e-mail and we started going back and forth online about what had happened.
we even met for coffee.
then you show up.
I mean, I never expected her to go to the prosecutor's office.
believe me, I never would have sent her that letter if I would have known.
we're still deciding whether to press charges.
look, I've got a wife and two kids.
I can't go to prison.
maybe if you told me your side of the story?
we hooked up at a party at my frat house.
it was one of those situations, you know?
I thought we had a good time together.
well, she didn't.
she said she screamed, tried to fight you off.
I don't know about that.
I had a lot to drink.
how long you been sober?
four years, three months.
ever since my oldest boy, Michael, was born.
I'm two years in myself. Gambler's anonymous.
no kidding?
you used to hit it pretty hard?
if you call 11 straight weekends in Vegas hitting it hard.
I lost $59, 000, my house and my fianc.
so I understand about making things right.
what were you making amends for, Tim?
it wasn't just a bad date?
I'm sorry if she felt violated in some way.
violated?
did you violate her?
he actually said violated?
he stopped just short of saying he raped her.
did he acknowledge that she said no repeatedly at the top of her lungs?
he said he might have misread her signals.
what about date rape drugs?
he said there were definitely roofies circulating at that party, but he denied drugging her.
the most he would say is it's possible somebody slipped her something.
what a weasel.
a weasel with a guilty conscience.
so what do you think?
you want me to pick up lover boy and start talking to witnesses?
from what he told you and the letter,
I think we definitely have enough to convince a judge.
Yeah, pick him up.
Hey, babe.
Hey, buddy, how's it going?
Mr. O'neil.
Yeah, what?
you're under arrest for the rape of Ellen Pinter.
Tim, what's happening?
don't worry about it, honey, I'll deal with it.
you have the right to remain silent.
you have the right to counsel.
if you can't afford an attorney...
I thought we understood each other.
I never been to Vegas in my life, brother.
never been engaged. Never crapped out on my mortgage.
me, I don't have to make amends.
you, you're just getting started.
Becky, let me guess, you're representing O'neil.
why is it rapists always hire female attorneys.
alleged rapists.
a copy of the motion I just filed to dismiss your case.
you need a little remedial math over here in the prosecutor's office.
this is a waste of paper. There's no statute of limitations issue here.
Oh, that's news to me.
he drugged her, Becky, that makes it a class A felony.
and your proof of that is what? A blood test? A tox screen?
point of clarification, we're representing the victim.
you're defending the guy who raped her and then 11 years later felt kind of bad about it, sort of.
have you read his letter?
that's what I'm basing my character assessment on.
he doesn't say he raped her.
he says he's sorry that she felt badly about their encounter that night.
I know what it says.
something that happens between consenting adults is not...
they weren't adults, and she didn't consent.
tim O'neil pulled his life together after nearly destroying it with alcohol.
he's serious about his recovery, which is why he wrote the letter.
isn't that worth some consideration?
Yeah, this much. Becky, the man's a rapist.
you really see the world in black and white, don't you?
people are either all good or all bad to you.
except they're not.
who cares what Becky Brokaw thinks?
I don't, I care what you think.
you don't see the world in black and white, just in fewer shades of gray than most people.
but that's what makes you such a good prosecutor, your emotional connection to the victim.
I don't see any shades of gray here just because Tim O'neil said he was sorry, sort of.
I met Mrs. O'neil on the way in.
she had her two little kids with her.
that must have been awful.
at least Tim O'neil expressed some remorse.
most don't.
how many victims' families have told us just hearing the words"I'm sorry" would have made a difference?
I think you're confusing remorse with a guilty conscience.
what's the difference?
O'neil may have said I'm sorry, but he has never owned up to what he did.
Ellen Pinter needs to hear him admit to raping her and then apologize, and if he won't say it, I'll have a jury say it for him.
if the judge lets you.
your honor, the prosecution's date rape drug scenario is nothing but a bad faith allegation, a transparent attempt to get past the statute of limitations.
the reckless disregard for the minimum standard of proof is as suspicious as this mystery drug they're claiming was used to subdue the victim.
this is a hyperbole-free zone, Ms. Brokaw. Ms. Chase.
your honor, as stated in the charging information, the people have reason to believe that the victim was drugged and subsequently raped, which the law strictly construes as the standard for tolling the statute.
the victim's uncorroborated testimony includes the admission that she consumed alcohol on an empty stomach and subsequently felt lightheaded.
no quantum leap of logic is needed.
your honor, it's for the jury, not the defense, to determine the credibility of the victim.
thank you, Ms. Chase, I went to law school, too.
so now that everyone's had their say,
I'll issue my ruling within 24 hours.
right now this case rests solely on Ellen Pinter's testimony and Tim O'neil's letter.
now, barring an actual confession from O'neil, fat chance.
we are in desperate need of corroboration of the events that evening.
ray's talking to potential witnesses, but it's been 11 years.
finding them is one thing.
getting them to admit to actually seeing something is another thing altogether.
we should talk to Mrs. Pinter's husband, too.
thank you, Sarah.
judge Michaels' ruling.
this is moot if he won't toll the statute.
the allegation that the defendant" drugged the victim before assaulting her"satisfies the plain language of the class A felony rape.
the information is valid on its face.
no statute of limitations applies.
Ellen Pinter's finally going to get her day in court.
look, this case is far from a cinch for both sides.
I don't think Brokaw's gonna want to take it to trial either.
either? I do.
I would hate to see him walk away because of a hung jury-- or worse.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
Hey, this is not about you. This case is iffy.
if O'neil is willing to add the postscript "I'm guilty of raping you" to his letter, then I think eight years is fair.
I'd say that's too lenient by far.
twelve.
fine, 12. After the arraignment, make the deal.
I think we both realize no one's interests will be best served by a trial, especially the victim'S.
you won't like what I'm going to offer.
then let me go first. Four years, two suspended.
let's be serious. - What's serious?
twelve. - 12 years?
what is that, some kind of vindictive old testament number?
11 years of silence plus one? - 11 years of suffering plus one.
contingent on a full admission of guilt and an apology to the victim.
you are really going for blood.
take it or leave it.
no matter what you think he did 11 years ago, Annabeth, the jury is going to see Tim O'neil for who he is now.
Yeah, they are.
a man feigning remorse, unwilling to accept responsibility and feeling entitled to a group hug instead of an appropriate prison sentence.
12 years is unacceptable.
then I'll see you at trial, where you'll do a lot worse.
Ellen and I didn't meet until the following semester.
I was the teaching assistant in her IT class.
and you had no idea?
we've been married for seven years, and she never mentioned it.
not until that damn letter arrived.
your wife said you knew O'neil.
not very well. We had friends in common.
he was always after me to join the fraternity.
these friends you had in common, you think you could give me a list of names, the ones who might still live in Indianapolis?
anything I can do.
you've reconsidered?
what would your offer be if my client were to give you the name of another man who raped Ellen Pinter on the night in question?
she never said anything about a second rape.
she didn't know.
she was unaware of being assaulted by this man.
because she was unconscious at the time.
this other guy is the individual who drugged her at the party.
Mr. O'neil, why didn't you tell us this before?
you can only make amends for yourself, not for someone else.
or you were holding it in reserve as a bargaining chip.
Annabeth, don't be cynical.
this sounds like an admission of guilt.
not to drugging her.
are you willing to come clean?
we'll consider it, if we can reach a reasonable compromise.
less than 12.
if we can make a case against the second rapist, and if Mr. O'neil allocutes to his crime in open court and apologizes to the victim.
I just want to see my kids grow up.
if making a deal and testifying is the only way, then I'll do that.
what are you prepared to say, Mr. O'neil?
that I raped Ellen Pinter that night, and I have regretted it ever since.
satisfied? - It's a start.
I can't wait to tell Ellen Pinter the worst experience of her life is actually far worse than she ever imagined.
don't put it off.
maybe we should have O'neil write her another letter.
he has such a way with words.
ray, talk to us about the second rapist.
Alex Peterson, 33, VP out of downtown brokerage.
he's supposed to be a hard charger with major upside potential.
he's got a wife, two kids, a Porsche and a five-bedroom colonial outside in Crestview.
same class as O'neil, president of the fraternity at the time.
make sure you get his tory on the record so we have something to impeach when he lies to us.
impeach with what?
testimony from the fraternity brothers Ray's interviewed.
and if we can't find anyone who'll tell us the truth?
these guys bond for life, like a pack of wolves.
you have my word no sweeter deal for O'neil unless we can corroborate his story about Alex Peterson.
I'll break the news to Ellen Pinter.
tag along, Ray. - Moral support.
did they plan this?
did they see me at the party and say "her, let's get her"?
I'm sorry, Ellen, I can't answer that yet.
is he the only other one, or were there others?
not according to O'neil.
he wasn't even gonna mention this until he had to.
I feel sick. I thought coming forward would make things better.
if O'neil testifies, we're going to get Peterson, too, right?
that's the plan.
right now he's our only witness to the second rape.
a confessed rapist who's cutting a better deal for himself.
we have to work with what we've got.
hopefully the jury will take into account that he came forward in the first place and find him credible.
we're working on finding other witnesses.
no one's gonna say a word.
why would they after they've kept quiet for 11 years?
people can surprise you when they get the opportunity to do the right thing.
you think?
well, you have a lot higher opinion of people than I do.
I can't handle this.
Ellen, you came to us because you wanted justice.
let me try to get it for you, please.
who's asking?
ray Blackwell, prosecuting attorney's office.
one of my guys dip into petty cash or something?
this is about you, pal.
I'd like to ask some questions.
about what? - About a fraternity party.
a fraternity party? There must have been hundreds of them.
well, this one was 11 years ago.
there was a young woman passed out in an upstairs bedroom.
like I said, those parties were crazy.
she was drugged. Jog your memory?
or were there hundreds of them, too?
I'll make my attorney available.
october, you're talking about Bach, first big party as a pledge.
Bach? As in classical music?
as in Bacchus, the Greek god of wine.
he's a demigod, actually.
if I recall, you were praying to the Greek demigod of porcelain all night long.
when you're a pledge, they build up Bacch like it's going to change your life.
really it's just like any other party.
a bunch of horny drunks revving each other up into the red zone.
either of you see O'neil or Peterson that night?
it was a long time ago.
they must have been-- all the seniors were there.
what about O'neil or Peterson with this girl?
don't remember her.
Nah, no, sorry.
take another look.
she was raped that night at your fraternity house, at that party.
not by us, brother.
my client denies knowing Ellen Pinter, formerly Ellen Richards, and has no knowledge of the alleged events of October 13, 1996.
his friend, Tim O'neil, tells a different story.
the delirium tremens ravings of an alcoholic with a guilty conscience.
in this letter of his, does O'neil even mention a second guy?
that's what I thought.
I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
you were trying to intimidate us?
does your client remember bringing roofies to that fraternity party?
roofies?
it's a date rape drug, which, I'm sure you know.
why would I need a date rape drug?
Mr. Peterson has no recollection of that particular party.
other witnesses will.
and this is his opportunity to come forth and tell the truth, which will be taken into consideration during sentencing.
you're getting ahead of yourself, counselor.
other than the desperate finger-pointing of an alcoholic rapist, you have exactly what evidence against my client?
something else you want to tell me about that party?
I'm actually in a hurry.
who's the Greek demigod of lying?
who had the roofies?
I don't know, but everybody was talking about them the next morning.
did you know what Peterson and O'neil were up to?
no, no way.
I swear, I didn't see them with that girl.
what did you see?
it's time to be a man, Brian.
step up and tell the truth.
I was up on the second floor, all right?
I saw Alex come out of Tim's room.
you didn't see Ellen Richards at all?
well, not that night.
the next morning I was downstairs early.
I saw her rush by, looking kind of rough.
did you speak to her?
no, I mean, I asked if she was okay, but she just blew right past me.
later on that morning,
I saw Alex and Tim having this conversation.
tim was really freaked out about something, but Alex just kept yelling at him, telling him to shut up.
either of them mention Ellen? - No.
when Alex saw me, he kind of lost his cool for a second.
what did he say?
well...
he told me that if I didn't say anything, he'd make sure I got accepted into the fraternity.
did you?
I'm ashamed to say.
O'neil's ready to testify.
we've got a witness to back up his story about Peterson possessing roofies.
this is a good day.
we should finalize O'neil's deal.
he pleads guilty to aggravated sexual assault.
six years, serves four.
please tell me you're joking.
no less than ten is acceptable.
peterson will get 20 years.
if he's convicted.
his attorney will use any deal with O'neil to club us over the head with and discredit his testimony.
and the jury will look at O'neil and see a guy who eventually did the right thing.
because it's in his own best interest.
if we have a tough deal in place with him, it at least makes him more credible.
this might be one of those times when seeing the world in black and white actually impairs your vision.
you feel sorry for him?
I feel sorry for his family.
cutting a sweetheart deal with O'neil goes against everything.
call it whatever you want, the reason I get up every morning and go to work.
well, that'll sound great in your retirement speech.
however, for now, you need to remember that this is how business gets done every day of the week in every prosecutor's office in this country.
Annabeth, do your job.
you answer every question honestly.
the first time I catch you in a lie, the deal is off.
I understand.
whose idea was it to rape Ellen Pinter?
the idea to, uh, knock a girl out with roofies and take advantage of her...
you mean rape her.
that was Alex's.
and who picked out Ellen?
I did.
she was young and pretty and vulnerable?
I was drunk and aggressive and ashamed of myself pretty much as soon as it was over.
so ashamed it took you 11 years to admit it.
I did a terrible thing.
I knew it. I never did it again.
I'm not a terrible person.
you don't need to convince me of that, Mr. O'neil, just the jury.
so you hear from Ed?
postcard.
wish I was in Maui.
he says it rained every day.
he's a liar.
speaking of it, how is New York?
it's good.
yeah? What'd Dr. Graham say?
clean bill of health. Nothing but acid reflux.
Oh, that's fortunate, huh?
I know you had him on the phone ten minutes after I walked out of there.
I couldn't get him to tell me a damn thing.
that's 'cause it's nothing, trust me.
want me to tell sex crimes to pick him up?
O'neil puts him in the bedroom, but as a witness, he's problematic.
Brian Hall puts him coming out of the bedroom.
husband Craig knows more than he's saying.
is this based on anything more than the acid reflux in your famous gut?
it's body language.
the way he acts with his wife.
but not to her.
that's why I thought I'd drop by their house a little later.
what now? Ellen is already in bed.
Oh, I was hoping to have a word with you.
like I said, it's late.
for you too, right?
come on.
it's buzzing around like a hornet inside your head.
you're dying to tell someone what you know.
anybody but your wife.
I heard the rumor a week later.
it was all over campus that O'neil and Peterson drugged and raped a girl at the Bacch party.
give me a name, Craig.
he told you about the roofies himself?
he was trying to be my buddy.
he invited me to the party and offered me one, said I should try it out on somebody.
yeah?
but I never knew who she was.
and I sure as hell didn't know Ellen was the girl.
so you've known for a month and said nothing.
I didn't want to make things even worse for you.
but that's just what you did.
I... I feel so confused.
but I feel like i can't trust him.
are you worried about testifying?
Yes.
we won't call you if you don't want us to.
thank you.
I feel like my life, my marriage, it's all upside down.
I feel estranged from my husband.
and the man that I'm relying on for justice is one of the men who raped me.
well, we hope to convince the jury that he's trying to make things right.
because it's good for him.
do you think he's really sorry for what he did?
I don't know.
are you sober? - Of course.
I couldn't do that to my family.
making amends is the ninth step.
do you remember the tenth?
continue to take personal inventory and when I'm wrong promptly admit it.
that's just what you're doing today.
where was Alex Peterson while you raped Ellen?
outside in the hall.
after I, uh, finished, I let him in.
what was Ellen doing?
she'd passed out.
while you were raping her? - Yes.
and when Mr. Peterson came into the room, did he say anything?
she looked like she was ready to have a real good time.
and he was going to give her one.
what happened next?
he raped her.
he raped her? - Yes.
while she was unconscious? - Yes.
and you were in the room the entire time?
you witnessed all of this? - Yes.
and after he was finished with her?
he got dressed and went downstairs to party.
what did you do? - I fell asleep.
you fell asleep next to the woman you just raped?
Yes.
Mr. O'neil, why are you testifying for the prosecution today?
it's part of my plea agreement.
so after this trial, you will be going to prison?
as soon as I finish testifying.
and as part of your plea agreement, did anyone ask you to fabricate anything?
exaggerate Mr. Peterson's role in the crime and diminish your own culpability?
no.
nothing further.
this plea agreement of yours, how long will you spend in prison?
the sentence is for six years.
how long would you actually serve?
about four years.
and what kind of penalty would you have faced had you stood trial like Alex Peterson?
up to 20.
so by getting on the stand and lying about Mr. Peterson, you've been able to shave off approximately 16 years from your sentence.
objection.
sustained.
did you tailor your testimony to obtain this enviable agreement from the prosecutor's office?
no.
isn't it true that the entire plan to rape Ms. Richards was your own?
no.
and when Alex Peterson discovered what you had done, he terminated his friendship with you and had you expelled from the fraternity.
I left on my own.
and subsequently fell into an alcoholic stupor that lasted for years.
isn't that why you're here?
not only to save your own skin, but to have revenge on Mr. Peterson?
I came here to tell the truth.
and that's what I've done.
no point to any further questions for this witness, your honor.
redirect, your honor.
proceed.
Mr. O'neil, you came forward earlier this year of your own volition, did you not?
to make amends with Ellen Pinter.
to apologize for raping her 11 years ago.
and now that you're about to go to prison, do you regret coming forward?
we took advantage of an innocent girl.
I have to pay a price for that, and so does Alex.
this feels so strange.
tim O'neil had his 12 steps to recovery.
this could be one of yours.
they're taking him to prison?
right now? - Yeah.
maybe he really does have remorse for what he did to me.
maybe he does.
one down, one to go.
Mr. Hall, the night of the party, did you see Mr. Peterson?
Yes, on the second floor.
I saw Alex leaving Tim's room.
the next morning they were having this heated discussion.
Alex must have thought I'd overheard them.
did you? - Only a little bit.
tim seemed upset but, uh...
Alex was laughing.
what did he say?
Alex said that he was still the house's number one virgin surgeon.
and what happened next?
well, then Alex promised me that I would get into the fraternity if I didn't say anything.
a quid pro quo for your silence?
that's how I understood it, yes.
thank you, Mr. Hall.
Alex Peterson explicitly asked you to lie for him?
he promised he would get me into the fraternity.
did he ask you not to tell anyone that he had raped Ellen Richards?
not in so many words.
in fact, not at all.
Alex was the one that had the roofies at the party.
I just put two and two together.
did you see my client distributing this controlled substance?
no, but other guys had said that he had given them roofies.
move to strike. Hearsay.
sustained. Mr. Hall, you'll limit your testimony to those events of which you have only firsthand knowledge.
do you have firsthand knowledge that Alex Peterson drugged and raped Ellen Richards?
no.
nothing further for this witness.
I had heard the rumors about that party, but I didn't think they were true.
we had mutual friends.
Alex was after me to join the fraternity.
the more I said no, the more he pursued me.
he invited me to the party.
he said that it was going to be the party of the year.
when I asked him why, he said he'd show me.
and what did Alex Peterson show you?
roofies.
he said that he and O'neil were planning on trying them out that night.
there was going to be a lot of hot babes at the party.
and he asked me if I wanted one to use.
to use? - On a girl.
he was offering you a date rape drug?
Yeah.
and did you accept?
no, of course not.
thank you.
your witness.
you testified that you did not attend the party in question.
that's correct. I was at the library all night.
so you have no firsthand knowledge of any events that may or may not have occurred at that party 11 years ago.
that's right.
so this story of yours, Mr. Pinter, that so conveniently fits into the prosecution's case like a missing piece of a puzzle
you didn't breathe a word of this to anyone for 11 years, did you?
no.
you didn't tell the school. - No.
or the police? - No.
and when you found out that your wife was the woman who, in fact, had been raped at that party, you didn't say anything to her, did you?
no, I didn't.
but now, to bolster a weak case by the prosecution, you've miraculously unearthed this buried treasure of a memory.
I now realize everything I did was wrong.
that's why I'm here.
to tell the truth.
what's true is that you would walk into this courtroom and say anything--anything in front of this jury, to crawl back into your wife's good graces, wouldn't you?
objection. - Sustained.
lower the rhetoric, Mr. Matthews.
nothing further, your honor.
the people rest, your honor.
court will adjourn until tomorrow, at which time the defense will have the opportunity to present its case.
I'm not sure they'll even put on a case.
you think Matthews is that confident?
it's a jump ball.
depends how O'neil did with the jury.
if they bought his act of contrition.
you don't think they'll call Ellen?
it's too risky for Matthews.
he'd have to handle her with kid gloves.
right. If it looks like he's beating up on the victim...
what about Peterson?
if he puts Peterson on the stand, he risks having one of you two expose him for the smirky creep that he is.
I'm not sure if Alex Peterson's ego will let him stay off the stand.
well, let's hope you're right.
if we get a shot at Peterson, that would be a real break.
Mr. Matthews, are you ready to call your first witness?
Yes, your honor.
defense calls Ellen Pinter.
your honor, we were not informed of this.
we need time to prepare.
we're calling her as a rebuttal witness, your honor.
to whose testimony, counselor?
I'll allow it.
the bailiff with locate Ms. Pinter, bring her to court.
we will reconvene in one hour.
Mrs. Pinter, do you see Timothy O'neil anywhere in this courtroom?
no.
isn't he the man who raped you?
one of them.
the only one you were ever aware of.
the one you identified.
the one who confessed.
the one who's now serving a prison term for that crime.
Yes. But there was a second one.
according to Tim O'neil. - Yes.
when did you first meet Mr. O'neil?
when I was a freshman in college.
where were you at the time of the crime?
at his fraternity house.
Mrs. Pinter, I'm very sorry to have to put you through this.
if you'll just bear with me.
I won't ask you to tell us what happened that night.
we've already heard Mr. O'neil's testimony.
what he did to you.
thank you.
while Mr. O'neil assaulted you, were you conscious the entire time?
at first.
at some point before he finished, I passed out.
Mrs. Pinter, have you ever seen my client before today?
not in person, no.
never? - No.
he made sure of that when he and O'neil drugged me.
move to strike.
Mrs. Pinter, please refrain from offering commentary.
before seeing Alex Peterson in this courtroom, you wouldn't have known the difference between Alex Peterson and Payton Manning.
Yes.
so is it safe, then, to assume that you never saw him drug you?
never saw him commit any crime at all?
the point of drugging a woman so that you can rape her is so that she won't be able to identify you.
but you identified Tim O'neil, didn't you?
well, he made his move too soon.
he couldn't wait until I passed out.
the fact remains that you cannot identify Alex Peterson as a person who drugged and raped you, can you?
no.
as far as you know, he never assaulted you.
as far as I know.
Mrs. Pinter, I'm very sorry for what happened to you that night.
but the only one you know for a fact who assaulted you is who?
nothing further.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the bailiff has informed me you've reached a verdict.
if the foreperson could hand it to the bailiff.
in the matter of the state of Indiana V. Alexander David Peterson, the jury finds the defendant not guilty on all counts.
Hi.
I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for me.
and everything you tried to do.
I just wish we could have gotten a better result.
well, what happens now is more important to me than what happened inside that courtroom.
you're right.
you know, guys like Alex Peterson, they never change.
he'll screw up again and we'll put him where he belongs.
I look forward to that.
okay, I did it.
why am I here?
partial confession at the scene.
partial?
she caught me by surprise.
how?
she said, I did it.
so what's the problem?
I ask her about the blood on the leash, and she blurts out, I did it.
please don't arrest mein front of my kids.
her son gets in her face, starts accusing her, we pull her off to the side, put the cuffs on her, bring her down here.
I was so rattled, it wasn't until we got in the car.
your actions on the scene may have resultd in a questionable confession.
it sounds so much better when you say it.
her son accused her?
what did he say... exactly?
you finally did it, didn't you?
you killed him, just like you always said you would.
talk to me about the victim.
Peter Stratton, psychiatrist. 62 years old.
thriving practice at the university med center.
married Corinna Stratton when he was 40.
she was 18.
creepy but not criminal.
is the confession going to be a problem?
wouldn't hurt to shore it up with a little corroborating evidence.
well, here's what we got so far.
somebody crushed his skull with a blunt object, probably wood.
techs recovered wood particles from the scalp.
body temperature indicates time of death around 9: 00 P. M.
son found the body approximately 12 hours later.
she let her kid discover the body?
talk about a Freudian moment.
bloody paw prints on the front walk pointing away from the house.
and a bloody finger print on the leash.
which she wiped down, but she missed a spot.
his blood, her print, their dog.
killed her husband, then took the dog out for a walk.
first things first.
anyone else in the house other that the son?
younger sister. They're with the grandparents now.
the Strattons have two other kids, one in Florida and one in college here in town--Carly and David.
murder weapon? - Unrecovered so far.
she could have chucked the murder weapon when she walked the dog.
PD did a sweep. Came up with zero.
she's been vague on just where she went that night.
go back and question her again.
it's too late. She lawyered up. Public defender.
all right, look.
talk to the kids before they have a chance to contaminate each other's stories.
and I want to know more about Mrs. Stratton and these threats she might have made against her husband.
and find that murder weapon.
she's been threatening to kill him for years.
ever since I can remember.
you know where she might have went that night with the dog?
I don't know. She usually just takes her around the block.
was it unusual for you to come down to the kitchen and your mom not be up yet?
Yeah, but it's obvious why.
she wanted me to find him.
what a crock. I never heard my mom threaten my dad. Not once, my whole life.
your brother Jay said it was an everyday thing.
he says she's paranoid. He hates my mom. Always has. He's a fanatic.
my dad treated some very sick people.
very disturbed people. Psychotics. I mean, maniacs.
it had to be one of his patients.
I just know it.
we got one kid who says she did it, one says no way, and another is in complete denial.
what about the older sister?
Carly. We finally got through to her down in Boca Raton.
she's not even coming back for the funeral.
she's not coming in for her own father's funeral? Interesting.
have her deposed down there.
absent the weapon, do we have enough to charge Mrs. Stratton?
a confession should be enough if it isn't thrown out.
so I understand there's a new sheriff in town.
thought I'd pop up and pay my respects.
Doug Hellman, Jim Conlon.
Jim, it's nice to meet you. Annabeth, Maureen.
by the way, I'm going to need all your evidentiary material on the Stratton case so far.
you're representing her?
Mrs. Stratton called a few hours ago and asked me to take over the case, so as soon as you can?
and I have a few things to drop off here.
here's a motion to suppress initial interview, motion to suppress the second interrogation, and motion to suppress the so-called confession.
I assume you are charging her? - With murder.
well, I'll see you at the arraignment then.
Jim, it's nice to meet you.
Annabeth, Maureen, always a pleasure.
better call the babysitter. Looks like it's going to be a late night.
you worried about these? - Not if we're prepared.
Doug Hellman's a big bump up from public defender.
yeah? Well, I'm a giant step up from my predecessor.
one count of murder.
how do you plead, Mrs. Stratton?
not guilty, your honor.
ask the defendant be held without bail.
now, surely, not even our exuberant prosecuting attorney is suggesting that Corinna Strattonis a danger to the community?
we have forensic evidence and a confession.
which has little chance of surviving the motion to suppress.
she was fully mirandized.
well after she was taken into custody by an over zealous police officer.
she freely admitted to the crime.
she was attempting to spare her children further trauma.
she would have said anything.
including "I did it"?
counsel has not yet addressed my question.
now, how is Mrs. Strattona danger to anybody?
she callously left her husband's bloody body where her own children could find it.
she is a danger to them at the very least.
she killed her husband, your honor. Res ipsa loquitur.
the thing speaks for itself.
that remains to be seen, ms. Chase.
indiana criminal code, section 353382.
a murder charge is bailable when the proof of guilt is not sufficiently evident.
bail is set at $150, 000.
the minor children will remain in the custody of the maternal grandparents.
assuming you make bail, you are not to go near the children, Mrs. Stratton, or I will revoke your bail sooner than you can say Jack Robinson, do you hear me?
Yes. - Your honor.
your honor. - Next case.
okay, we did well. - Case number 52745.
you know and I know she did this.
you know and I know your evidence is weak. Want to make a deal?
you're out of your mind. - Yeah.
well, when you come crawling back to me. I promise to be gentle.
Hellman's just trying to see if he can make us blink.
dig into this marriage and find a motive.
we're arranging for depositions from the kids.
and we've asked Dr. Parent to do a walk-through of the crime scene, see if she can give us any insight into the psychiatrist and his wife.
takes one to know one.
look, let me be clear about one thing.
there will be no sweet heart deals in murder cases.
amazing how normal they look.
notice anything about these pictures?
the kids. The kids and mom.
the kids and mom and the dog.
the kids at school. But where's dad?
she excludes him from her domain, and she advertises it.
look in here.
kids' clothes meticulously stacked.
mom does hers out of sight.
classic act of martyrdom.
and she won't even touch the husband's laundry.
so he leaves it out to remind her of her misbehavior.
all that from a pile of laundry.
dad does the same thing.
he wants everyone to know he worships his kids.
but no shrine to mom or Carly, the oldest daughter.
the one who got away.
and just one picture of David.
and look. His eyes are closed. Now, is that symbolic?
like he's blind to something or...?
I don't know what Dr. Stratton saw in this picture, but I think we can assume one thing from the fact that he chose to display it.
well, he obviously didn't like David as much as the other two.
david was on mom's side.
that's interesting.
Annabeth, I hope you're in a receptive frame of mind you should save your breath, we got a really strong case.
I'll save mine but Corinna has something you're going to want to hear.
we found the murder weapon, Doug.
which she tried to destroy.
it's a match.
it was self-defense. He attacked me.
bruises on her back and shoulder.
that's a shadow, not a bruise.
she bashes his head in, leaves his body overnight in his study where her children can find it and then goes upstairs and goes to bed.
what part of that argues self-defense?
don't forget, she was so injured that she walked a good mile and a half to get rid of the murder weapon and then walked back home again.
my adrenaline was pumping.
Yeah, I bet it was.
what precipitated this allege attack?
I finally got up the courage and I went to him that night and said it was over.
I wanted a divorce.
and custody of Jay and Francesca.
he slammed me against the wall. Shoved me into a table.
any evidence of this, a witness?
francesca was upstairs and Jay was out.
I thought he was going to kill me.
and I grabbed that bat, his precious cricket bat which was a joke, he never played cricket in his life, except the summer he spent at Oxford.
Mrs. Stratton. - What happened after he attacked you?
I whirled around and hit him. - Then left him for dead.
I didn't know he was dead.
why didn't you call 9-1-1?
I didn't think he was hurt that badly.
it was all a blur.
I walked Maggie, I went up stairs and I went to bed.
burning the bat, was that a blur too?
I thought he'd be able to use it against me to take the kids.
use it against you, you mean your assault with a deadly weapon?
my defending myself.
I had to get rid of the bat, so I burned it.
Doug, come on, are you kidding me?
all right, now look, we are prepared to accept a charge of involuntary manslaughter for four years, two suspended.
voluntary man, ten years.
four suspended. She'll do six.
stop. Four years?
six years, that's completely unacceptable, I'm innocent.
why should I have to go to prison?
Corinna, just let me...
no, you're not listening to me, any of you.
I am listening. We are all listening here.
when I was 15, I was Peter's psychiatric patient.
is this part of the show?
well, at the moment, I have to say we're a little bit off the map here.
I was 15. I was troubled, vulnerable.
he was my doctor. He was supposed to help me.
and instead he seduced me.
he seduced you?
he had sex with me.
did he ever coerce you into having sex?
coerce, what does that mean, I was a kid.
but you grew up and married him.
you had four children with him.
I was young. I didn't know what else to do.
he was the only man I getting married made us normal.
it made everything okay.
for everyone else, for my parents.
as far as everyone else was concerned, we were the all-American family.
Mrs. Stratton, even if what you're saying is true, it doesn't justify you murdering your husband 25 years later.
well, you have to admit it makes a hell of a story.
so the self-defense was predicated on the abuse.
the story may ring true to some people.
it's a guarantee hell man will milk it for everything it's worth.
you got to push back.
talk about the victim's standing in the community.
a respected psychiatrist with a 30 years practice.
spin the wife as reedy and conniving.
this is not New York.
people here are not big on psychiatrists and this one molested his teenage patient.
if we hammer on this we give it credence.
look, you got to play hardball.
which I'm saying could backfire.
I just got a fax from Peter Stratton's lawyer.
according to him, Dr. Stratton was the one who wanted the divorce.
he was all set to file.
he also told his lawyer he was afraid of his wife.
feared for his life. - Hearsay.
though we could get it in.
I know the existing mental condition exception.
if divorce was his idea it's hard for her to claim that he attacked her when she brought it up.
well, you've had a busy week.
two radio shows, an op-ed.
Yes, which generated three letters to the editor calling Peter Stratton a pervert of one sort or another.
in Indiana, grandmas, who happen to make up at least half of all jurors, are just going to hate your victim.
you really think you can spin the jury pool so blatantly?
Yeah, well, I prefer to think of it as setting the table to insure people keep an open mind.
speaking of setting the table. Thanks.
defense attorneys don't usually ask the people out to lunch, unless they're up to something.
so how are you doing by the way?
I'm okay.
thanks for asking.
I just wanted to give you a heads-up, uh, Corinna wants to be present at the kids' depositions.
no way. Not a chance.
she has a legal right to be there.
she has a restraining order, Doug.
she can't come within two miles of her kids.
already run it past judge Cooper and as long as a bailiff is present...
you know as well as I do, she wants to intimidate the witnesses, aka, her children.
I got her solemn word she won't open her mouth.
Yeah, that's legally binding.
Doug, come on, who's interested in depositions except lawyers.
well, apparently Mrs. Stratton takes an avid interest in the law.
I'm sure she does.
and while you were talking to your dad?
my mother came in.
I was tired so I said good night, went upstairs.
did you hear them arguing after you went upstairs?
I heard them, but my parents don't argue.
they're both really good at talking about their feelings, things like that, so it's not so much arguing, more like, you know, discussion.
heated discussion. - Normal.
could you hear what they were discussing?
I-I was listening to music.
and chatting with my friends online.
Jay calls me up, mom killed dad.
mom killed dad!
I'm, like, did you see mom kill dad?
Uh...no.
well, then how do you know that, Jay? She just did.
I tried talking to him but you can't talk to him.
he hates my mom.
why does he hate your mom?
to be on my dad's side.
anything that comes out of my brother's mouth it's like it's coming right out of my dad's mouth.
so your father also hated your mother.
he was always trying to convince you that she was wrong.
or stupid. Or crazy.
he was a master manipulator.
he could make you think that anything he said was your idea first.
you thought he was agreeing with you but really it was you agreeing with him.
and was he that way with your mom?
he was that way with everybody.
when I was like 11 or 12, mom finally caught on and started doing it back to him.
and he really didn't like that at all.
she stood up for me.
and she gave me the spine to stand up for her.
did your father resent you for standing up for your mom?
that's when things really got bad.
ever since then, it was like nonstop warfare in our house.
she'd fight with my dad over anything.
it's like a full-time job.
fighting with my dad.
she was fighting with him the day he was killed.
and what was that fight about?
one of their favorites, the garage door opener, there's nothing wrong with it, but she's so helpless she can't figure out the button, so it became all about my dad keeping her in prison for the rest of her life.
he deliberately provided me with a nonworking remote.
Doug. - Corinna, you cannot address...
but it's true he did.
did you ever hear your mother threaten your father's life?
she was always threatening him.
it was like, I'm going to poison you.
I'm going to throw a hair dryer in the bath tub.
like a joke but not a joke.
ha-ha, real funny, right?
try hearing it every day of your life.
did you father take these threats seriously?
sure he did. He was scared.
did you ever hear your mother talk about getting a divorce?
if she got a divorce, who'd she fight with?
the only reason I never left your father was to protect you.
I don't need your protection.
I don't need your mind games. - My mind games?
baby, he was the manipulator.
this is not a family therapy session Mrs. Stratton, one more word and I will have your bail revoked.
that's the deal Corinna, you cannot talk to the kids.
okay, I'm... okay.
did you father ever mistreat you or your siblings?
no.
he yelled at all of them, especially David.
you can't talk to me either.
well, shouldn't you object or something, you can't believe a word he says.
can't object at a deposition.
he might as well be his father. - Look, listen.
listen to me, this is off the record.
now, listen, this is not the way we do this.
now, I need you to trust me and have patience and let me handle things.
let me tell you something, I've been patient.
I've been patient my entire life.
waiting for somebody to listen to me.
and you stand here and you tell me I should let you handle things.
I don't want you handling things.
I want you gone.
I think we could use a little recess here.
I mean off this case.
Corinna, you don't mean that. Think about what you're saying here.
please inform the judge I no longer require your services.
and the next time you find yourself talking to a lawyer, young man, you'll be talking to me.
Corinna, this is not a good idea.
I have a constitutional right to represent myself.
don't tell me I don't.
this situation is highly unusual and potentially problematic.
the defendant will be cross-examining her own children who are arguably ancillary victims of the crime.
counselor is the attorney of record.
well, I would simply say, your honor, that I believe Mrs. Stratton would be more effectively represented by counsel.
Mrs. Stratton.
the supreme court affirmed in Faretta V. California, the sixth amendment right to self-representation.
even where such self-representation would be to a defendant's own detriment.
I would like to invoke that right.
you've done your homework.
I always do your honor.
I would like to state for the record that I think this is a misguided idea.
Mrs. Stratton, would you please acknowledge for the court reporter that you've heard me.
Yes, your honor, I understand you think it's a bad idea.
counselor, this is your lucky day.
you will sit second chair and participate as needed.
so ordered.
I heard.
pro se cases rarely work out for the defendant.
I know. I should be happy to have her representing herself, but why do I have this uneasy feeling?
be careful. It's like playing tennis against someone worse than yourself.
you play down, you could end up losing.
we're not going to play down, but Corinna's going to be talking to the jury all day, every day, destroying her dead husband's reputation.
if Hellman's smart... - which he is...
that's exactly what he'll get her to do--harp on what a creep he was, hope to peel off a sympathetic juror or two, and hang the case.
Oh, I got the oldest daughter's deposition from Florida.
fills out the family portrait.
Jay hates mom, David hates dad, Francesca's in denial, and this one, Carly, hates them both.
sounds like a perfect storm.
look, I know you're swamped, but I still need those indictment status reports in before you leave.
the entire seventh floor got theirs in early.
okay, how do you want to divvy this up?
you take the M. E. and shrinks, I'll take the kids?
delicious.
the victim was sitting with his back turned to his assailant.
the location of the wound clearly indicates that he was struck from behind.
in your professional opinion, were the victim's wounds consistent with a claim of self-defense?
in my professional opinion, they were not consistent with self-defense.
your witness.
not consistent.
does that mean impossible?
I've never seen it.
objection, your honor.
what are you objecting to? - His tone.
you can't object to his tone.
counselor, please educate your client on the basics of court room procedure.
move on, Mrs. Stratton.
do you recognize this?
it's the autopsy report on Dr. Stratton.
can you read what I've highlighted there on page seven, please?
evidence of silent cerebral infarction.
is that from getting hit on the head? - No.
it's a small cerebral stoke.
many people have silent, non-fatal strokes, Mrs. Stratton.
by some estimates, they're found in 12% of autopsies.
what brings on a stroke?
high blood pressure. Genetics, stress.
is it possible that this stroke was brought on by the stress of Peter attacking me?
objection. Facts not in evidence.
Mrs. Stratton, please rephrase the question.
make it more hypothetical.
is it possible that a person could attack someone, have a stroke, and die?
well, of course it's possible. - Thank you.
I'm finished, your honor.
redirect, your honor.
is that what happened here, doctor?
did Dr. Stratton have a fatal stroke caused by the stress of his fight with Mrs. Stratton?
the state of fibrinoid necrosis indicates that this trauma happened a minimum of 12 to 15 months ago.
this stroke was an old event.
refresh our memory, doctor.
what was the official cause of death again?
massive blood loss as a result of severe head trauma.
so, if somebody hadn't hit him on the head with a heavy, blunt object...
none of us would be sitting here today.
objection, your honor. There he goes again.
I agree with you. Sustained.
I noticed the light under the door in my dad's office.
keep thinking if I'd have gone in to say good night, if he was still alive, maybe...
I could have saved him.
what happened the next morning?
I found my dad lying on the floor of his office.
first thing I thought, she did it. She finally did it.
speculating. - Objection, your honor.
the witness was not asked what he was thinking.
sustained.
Hi, Jay. - Hi, mom.
your honor, the restraining order requires Mrs. Stratton to keep her distance.
Mrs. Stratton, move back, please.
did you ever know anybody named Danny Depaul?
you know I did.
can you tell the court who he was?
he was my best friend in junior high.
what happened to Danny Depaul, your friend?
he...
killed himself with his father's gun.
please tell the court what your father got you for your 15th birthday, just six months later.
what he gave me? It was...it was from both of you.
no, it wasn't.
whatever.
it was a hunting rifle.
and didn't that strike you as strange?
Yeah, I had asked for one the year before.
you guys said I was too young.
did you ever wonder if your father wanted you to do what Danny had done?
mom... you...you need help.
there's no way I ever thought that.
you were the one who reminded him I'd asked for it.
you told him to buy it for me.
that is your father talking, putting words in your mouth.
objection. She's testifying.
sustained.
tell me this--did you ever go hunting?
no. I...I wanted a guitar.
I told dad, he took the gun back, he got me a guitar.
that's what happened.
I wonder what she was trying to accomplish today.
did she think Jay was suddenly going to take her side?
well, let's hope the jury sees Corinna for what she is--controlling and border line delusional.
you okay? - Yeah.
it's 8: 30, I got to get another report out to Conlon.
change can be good.
believe me, I've had enough change to last me a life time.
this is hard.
I should be home.
sometimes I worry that Haley pulled the short straw, you know?
I'm all she has now.
Hey, I was raised by a single working mom, and look at me.
Yeah.
question is, do I really want my daughter to grow up to be like us?
so who's their first witness?
David, the loyal one.
welcome to the Stratton family, home of parallel universes and alternative realities.
David, can you please tell the jury how you feel about spiders?
spiders?
you know, spider world.
you want me to talk about spider world?
please.
when I was about eight, you took me and Jay to a nature movie.
only it wasn't for little kids.
it was a 3-D movie, and the spider was, like, two stories high.
we both started crying.
Jay wet his pants.
it was awful.
David, can you read from this?
your honor, Mrs. Stratton needs to identify that document.
these are psychiatric files on my children kept by my late husband.
side bar, your honor?
Mrs. Stratton, you cannot with hold evidence so that you can bush whack the people at trial.
your honor, these witnesses are minors.
their mother cannot exploit access to their confidential medical records.
your honor, I wrestled with this.
there is stuff in these files that will be very painful for my family, but I finally decided late last night that I just had to share them.
what Mrs. Stratton means, your honor, is that her right to defend herself outweighs any patient's right to confidentiality.
these children have privacy rights under state and federal law.
not when the defendant is facinga murder charge, they don't.
I'm inclined to agree with you, Mr. Hellman.
ms. Stratton, you may continue.
your honor, the people also need time to prepare for cross-examination.
after this witness, we will adjourn for the day so that the people may review this new evidence.
I do not like surprises, Mrs. Stratton.
don't do it again.
step back.
can you tell the court what it says there, the part I highlighted?
august 12.
I took the boys to see spider world.
it was a significant stressor.
later induced hypnosis.
suggested their mother took them.
can you open that second file, and read what's on top?
this is from the day after your brother Jay's 15th birthday.
january 10.
Jay very upset over gun.
calmed him.
induced hypnosis.
suggested gun was his mother's idea.
suggested I wanted him to have a guitar.
upon awakening, Jay asked for guitar.
affirmative data. Stressors seem to increase suggestibility.
your honor, I would like to enter into evidence these files, which document years of psychological experimentation, including behavioral modification and hypnosis, performed on my kids at the hands of their father.
all of which was raw data for a clinical trial at Indiana University on adolescent behavior.
my husband used his own children as guinea pigs.
the defense rests, your honor.
30 years of confidential patient files.
where did the children's' files come from?
she claims they were mislabeled among his patient files, and she finally broke the code.
smart lady-- she knows how to lie to a judge and get away with it.
he turned his children into lab rats.
he deliberately stressed them out, and then measured them for their susceptibility to being hypnotized.
I think it's safe to say she gained some points with the jury.
if she knew where those files were, she must have known what he was up to.
she's complicit.
and we need to use that complicity for our rebuttal.
this is interesting.
hypnosis with Francesca, dated a couple of months before the murder.
suggested she chose to live with me, not her mother, after divorce.
according to her deposition, Francesca was in her father's study that night.
what if he was hypnotizing her when Corinna walked in on them?
using it to influence her in a divorce proceeding.
so she sees him doing to their daughter what he's been doing to her for years
controlling her, manipulating her.
she might even feel jealous.
Francesca's taking her place as an object of the doctor's attention.
but she hates him.
still, it's the only attention she gets, the only dynamic that she knows.
she's a control freak, too.
now she's losing control of the situation.
so she grabs the cricket bat.
if Francesca can remember anything about that night, she may be our rebuttal witness.
assistant prosecuting attorney Annabeth Chase.
Hi. I'm Carly.
we were told you were in Florida.
I just got in last night.
I came up to be with my brother and sister, lend them some moral support.
come in.
I was actually hoping to talk to your sister.
my grandparents are out, and I'm pretty sure grandma doesn't want Francesca talking to anyone.
can I ask you a question?
why didn't you come home for your dad's funeral?
cause I'm selfish, according to my mom.
never mind.
you don't know my family.
I'm beginning to.
Carly, were you aware of what your father was doing?
the hypnosis thing?
Yeah, I figured that one out my first year of college.
twisted, huh?
why do you want to talk to Francesca?
I think she can help us establish what really happened that night, definitively.
you mean, convict my mother.
Carly, you realize, if your mom's acquitted, she'll have custody of Francesca and Jay.
francesca, you need to talk to her. Tell her whatever you know.
I already have.
when you went into your father's study that night, what exactly did the two of you talk about?
francesca, don't you realize?
he was hypnotizing you.
no, he wasn't. - Yes, he was.
and you have to understand, Franny, he did it to all of us.
the worst part is, mom knew.
she let it happen.
you don't understand--I can't.
you need to tell the truth, Franny, in court.
can you make me?
I can. But I'm not going to.
no, I mean, can you make me, like legally? Because if you make me, then my mom won't be mad at me.
he called it his calm down voice.
when I was upset about something, dad would take me into his office and start talking.
I'd listen and breathe.
like a game, kind of.
is that what happened that night?
I was upset.
we went into his study.
he got out his file, like he usually did, and he started talking.
what were you upset about?
it was something my mom had told me.
she said I needed to come live with her.
and what did she tell you?
she told me what my dad had done to her when she was his patient, when she was my age.
I didn't believe her at first.
so what did you do?
I went to talk to my dad.
I told him what she had said.
what did he say?
he said he'd made a terrible mistake, and that my mom had held it over him their whole lives.
objection.
she shouldn't have to talk about this.
she was under hypnosis, her memory is unreliable.
strong V. State excludes evidence derived from hypnosis.
I'm merely establishing whether the hypnos is took place.
overruled. Go on.
francesca, did he talk to you in his calm down voice?
that the thing--he didn't that night.
he didn't use his calm down voice.
he said he was too tired.
then what happened?
my mom came in.
she said you can't just put her under and turn her against me like that.
you can't get rid of me that easily.
what do you think she meant by that?
at the time, I had no idea, but now I realize she thought I was under hypnosis.
did she say anything else?
she said she was going to ruin his reputation.
and he said, you've been saying that for 20 years. Go ahead.
I'm retiring anyway. I don't care anymore.
did your dad sound angry?
he was tired, not angry.
just really, really tired...
of everything.
thank you, Francesca. Nothing further, your honor.
I'm sorry, darling.
I know you didn't want to be here today, and the prosecution forced you.
you're a brave girl.
I want you to tell the truth.
if you had to decide, would you choose your father or would you choose me?
I wish I'd chosen you.
good girl.
can you tell us why?
because...
maybe then you wouldn't have killed daddy.
the facts are clear in this case.
the defendant does not dispute them.
she murdered her husband, then tried to destroy the evidence.
the children are the real victims here.
no matter what Peter Stratton did or did not do, no matter what crimes and injurie she may have committed against his family and his wife, murder was not the remedy.
and Corinna Stratton is guilty of murder.
I was 15 years old.
he was my doctor.
I had a big crush on him.
one day, I let him know how I felt.
he stood up, and he locked the door.
and then he asked me if he could sit next to me on the couch.
I had no experience.
when he sat next to me, I started to cry.
he was very gentle--hugging me, brushing away my tears.
I thought I was in love.
and I thought I was healed.
so when you ask yourself why didn't she leave him?
think back to that little girl--so trusting, so vulnerable.
and the only way she could make sense of her life was to marry her seducer.
and I did want to leave him, many, many times over the years.
but I just could not walk away and leave my children with him.
believe me, if anyone knew what he was capable of, it was me.
state of Indiana V. Corinna Denise Stratton.
the jury finds the defendant, on the charge of murder, guilty.
Hey, hey, Congrats.
if she's the standard for motherhood, I guess I'm doing pretty well.
well, speaking of motherhood, child protective services called.
the eldest sister Carly is going for custody.
they'd like you two to testify.
she's taking them to Florida?
she's returning home to Indianapolis.
she wants joint custody with the grandparents.
I'll support that, happily. - Me, too.
you know what I think?
you won-- don't rub it in.
I think they lived to fight with each other.
conflict was their relationship.
Yeah, and the relationship was her whole life.
he threatened to take that away, so she snapped.
they were both getting something out of that sick dynamic.
you know, um, I went through a pretty horrible divorce a few years back.
I know.
Yeah. Well...
the pain eventually goes away.
I mean, mostly. But the loneliness you know, when I have a good day, I still catch myself picking up the phone to call her.
so, Annabeth, how are you doing?
I mean, really. - Up and down.
good days and bad. Like you.
Oh, excuse me.
hello.
Hi.
yeah-- oh, okay. Well, I am on my way.
see you there.
ex-wife? Ah, it's a new girlfriend.
she's just getting back from a trip.
plane just got in;I got to meet her.
airport rendezvous?
clearly getting serious.
well, serious is meeting the parents.
airport run is strictly romance.
winner gets the check?
that would be me.
good night, counselor. - Night, counselor.
Hi. It's Annabeth.
she's doing good? Okay.
I was 14 years old then.
on the night of Awa Odori
I saw my mother crying as she danced.
hello. Thanks for calling.
thanks for you help.
look at the first plan.
the targets are couples in their forties and fifties.
a tour of the world's heritages plus making ceramics.
they reach hotels early...
so they have enough time to rest.
but they have loans to pay back and school expenses for children.
a little too expensive.
no more cost-cutting in food with middle-aged tourists.
cut down the air fare?
I tried to but no.
no stopover shopping?
squeeze one in the course and you'll get a kickback.
well I'll negotiate...
remake the plan with revised costs.
certainly.
Sakiko.
I found some new entertainment facilities.
I see.
I'll make reservations.
we'll make a new price list tomorrow.
alright.
Thanks.
I'll be going.
goodbye.
Bye.
hello.
Sakiko? This is Matsu in Tokushima.
Matsu?
why at this time of night?
Sakiko. Calm down and listen...
your mom's been hospitalized.
what's the matter with her?
don't take it too seriously.
the doc said...
Sakiko!
your mom wants to see the Awa Odori festival.
it's festival season.
two months to go but we're already in the festive mood.
you used to dance with your mom.
it was fun.
although I don't know why.
Mt. Bizan welcomes you.
see you.
Thanks.
Sakiko?
Keiko.
I thought you'd come tomorrow.
Matsu?
he returned to his shop.
go there for a drink later.
he's waiting for you.
I'm telling you it hurts.
I told you before. It hurts so don't do it again.
miss Sakai.
you're taking care of sick old men and women like me.
I know you're a good nurse.
but don't follow the doctors blindly.
the patients are watching you.
you're young pretty and bright.
you must know that.
hi Sakiko.
welcome back.
sit down here.
don't stand there. You're in the way.
behave yourself Mother.
save your lectures now.
you're in a hospital not your shop!
so I behave like a patient.
mother!
all right.
excuse me. I'm tired.
let me sleep.
how about tea?
we wanted to tell that nurse about her way of treating us.
Tatsuko is great. She really talks like a boss.
let's dry the laundry.
she's selfish.
this is your mother's stomach.
there's a dark shadow in the liver.
this is the pancreas.
a little dark and vague.
this must be the origin.
malignant tumors.
the lungs.
there are many tumors.
they're spreading all over her body.
I don't think any operation will be effective.
let's nurse her as we check her physical strength.
are you all right?
will she live?
through this summer.
I know a similar patient who survived for a year.
but I'm not sure.
what'll we do?
shall we let her know?
if you have a family to consult with...
none. We're alone.
the two of us.
my father...
he's dead.
the little girl was asked...
where are you from?
the girl replied
I'm from Tokushima Awa Province.
that's all for today.
very nice!
let us hear it again.
you're really good.
how's your mother?
they're still examining her.
you must take care of yourself.
thank you.
how long will you be here?
business is the stage for women. Don't leave it easily.
I know.
my disease is merely liver trouble.
so don't worry.
aren't you needed back home?
I have Keiko here.
I'm not so busy at this time of year.
I can stay longer.
I have something to tell you - Say it.
I was really shocked.
I want to quit.
Why? You're doing all right.
you're a good nurse. You help me a lot.
a patient scolded me.
she didn't let me inject her.
as if I were hurting her on purpose.
you're cold.
I'll really quit.
wherever you work... you'll disagree with someone.
be a nice nurse to your patients.
all right. I understand.
it won't be long before her bed becomes empty.
that's the spirit.
what did you say?
her bed becomes empty?
I mean...
no just words.
she doesn't mean it.
what's that?
are you a doctor?
I'm sorry.
I want to know what you meant.
just words?
what did you become a doctor for? Just words?
don't tell lies to your patients.
we patients depend on doctors and nurses in the hospital.
many of us are afraid every day of how they treat us.
this is the humble request of a dying old woman.
doctor. Nurse.
there might be some patients you like or dislike.
but we were created equal.
so treat us equally...
equally.
please watch over your poor patients.
mother...
thank you. - I'll come again!
they are finished... oh no!
great!
just like Tatsuko.
we were all surprised.
she's got guts.
some became her fans because she scolded them.
I wish I'd have seen them.
some years ago...
a popular singer came to her place.
his song was popular.
he was with his friends.
she tried to make them quiet but she left them alone.
I hit my wife.
she looked at me coldly and laughed.
Why? It doesn't make sense.
what a nuisance! He spoils the mood.
we have no liquor for kids.
come on don't call us kids.
I call kids kids.
do you know why he's crying?
who knows?
he has good reason to cry.
your song is popular but don't be so proud.
how dare you...
shut up idiot.
how dare you call me that!
let's not drink at such a lousy place.
let's get out.
they say it's the best shop here.
they're wrong.
so is your song because you don't know people have tears at heart.
don't talk like a preacher!
matsu bring salt. - Alright.
just get out!
that was his only hit song.
he became an actor but it wasn't an easy job.
at the Awa Odori festival four years later he visited her with a bouquet.
who is he?
Saburo Yoshino. He comes every year.
Saburo Yoshino? I know him.
if Tatsuko gets well let's go to the festival all together.
why don't we dance?
my muscles would ache.
something wrong?
miss Kono.
miss Kono.
I'm sorry.
doctor don't bow to me.
you scolded me.
I'm ashamed of what I said.
please forgive me.
I was worried and defeated.
scared too.
I didn't know what to say to you.
I was afraid you might want to change hospitals.
my name is Daisuke Terasawa.
I'm a pediatrician.
I'm Sakiko Kono.
that young doctor...
came to me in the ward and said "I'm ashamed of myself for what I said.
thank you for scolding me.
some character! I felt he got me.
I was surprised.
but on closer view he's handsome.
don't you think so Sakiko?
are you turning 34?
what?
miracle on 34th Street.
Yes!
sorry. I'm 32.
you got a lover?
no. I'm not interested in marriage.
you won't be able to see your grandchild.
devils will laugh if you talk about the future.
you've gotten well.
you'll be able to play soccer again.
Really?
so try hard.
I will.
no more medicines.
alright. Come here.
Dr. Terasawa.
chief Obata wants you. - Thanks.
excuse me.
good morning.
here's your lunch. Eat it.
Oh thank you.
a chicken bowl again.
what?
by the way I hear you offended Tatsuko.
Tatsuko?
Yeah.
did you apologize?
Yes.
if she got angry with you it was certainly your fault.
regret it. - Yeah.
that's all right. It's like a routine.
she was like that to me before.
I want her to take a private room.
but she hates it.
all the patients are equal" she says.
Oh it looks delicious.
eat it.
Terasawa. - Yeah?
she's joined the Dream Grass Society.
pass. - Here!
so do I! Last card!
great!
pass. - You pass?
I won! I'm a millionaire.
I am the second one!
see!
tell me the truth.
why don't we have...
a picture of my father?
you said he died long ago and you lost his pictures.
tell me the truth.
as a matter of fact
I didn't marry your father.
and he had another home elsewhere.
but Sakiko...
it's not something sad or regretful.
I loved your father very much.
and you're the child of the man I really loved.
then why did you lie to me?
you were ashamed.
you did a bad thing.
Sakiko! He's dead.
your father is gone.
I want to see him.
I want to see him.
I want to see him.
let me check your blood sugar level.
miss Kono.
help me.
guess who?
I win!
wait!
I came here before I left Tokushima.
it was a long time ago.
I loved the view of the sea here.
it told me the world was spreading far and wide.
so you became a travel agent?
maybe so.
when I came home from school one day my mother was wearing makeup.
she said "hello" over her shoulder.
I didn't want to see it again so I came home late.
when she was out I felt relieved.
what a bad daughter I was!
after autumn...
she won't live.
did you tell her that?
maybe that's what she wants.
but I don't know...
how to tell her... what to say.
have you ever heard of the Dream Grass Society?
no.
about self-dedication?
self-dedication?
to leave a body to science.
one agrees to dedicate one's body to the university after one dies.
the Dream Grass Society supports the system.
Tatsuko...
your mother wants to do that.
what would happen to her body?
medical students would dissect it.
dissect?
her family can refuse it.
Tatsuko needs her daughter's agreement to her dedication.
I think she did it all by herself.
there are many delicate problems.
it takes one to three years for the body to return to its family.
it's not a short time for the bereaved family.
what's this "message sheet?
a kind of letter from the dedicator to the students.
she can write anything.
anything?
Yes. Cheering words a poem a story of her dog anything.
the students will read it first then will dissect her body.
Tatsuko see you tomorrow.
thank you and take care.
good bye.
Tatsuko entrusted me with this.
she called me about this time last year.
she wanted me to give it to you.
why didn't she call me?
she wanted me...
to give it to you after she dies.
I'm back.
I'm soaking.
hello.
she told me to keep it a secret until she dies.
I don't know what it is.
but...
I thought I should give it to you earlier than that.
Kojiro Shinozaki.
tokyo.
my birthday.
Kojiro Shinozaki.
the year before I was born.
father!
who are your parents?
what are their names?
my father is Jurobei of Awa.
my mother is Oyumi.
Oyumi was surprised.
puppet Joruri.
you're right.
she should go out of the hospital for exercise once in a while.
thank you.
she's tough so she doesn't show the pain on her face.
but actually it must be painful.
take care of her.
she remembered the mole on her forehead.
Oh you are my daughter!
she was about to say that.
but she stopped...
I'm sorry.
I can't eat it all.
will you eat it?
why the sour look?
mother.
tell me the truth.
my father is alive isn't he?
why did you say he was dead?
mother!
we're even.
you lied to me didn't you?
when Dr. Shimada told you I'd die?
so we're even.
cut it out.
you don't need me?
you closed the shop without telling me.
you didn't tell me when you got hospitalized.
you make decisions alone.
it's on me.
I enjoyed it.
I want it too!
give it to me! Right.
I said cruel things to my mother.
when I'm with her
I feel...
as if I were alone in the world.
so I...
you told her how you felt?
I regret it...
but I couldn't tell her any other way.
it was better than telling her nothing.
I think so.
she must have a hard time for being unable to tell you about your father.
but she had some reasons.
only she knew.
no one but your mother.
no one else knew.
not even you her daughter.
may be.
she's Ionely.
a very Ionely person.
good morning.
good morning...
this is your book.
thank you.
mother.
I'll return to Tokyo. I have work to do.
you will? That's better.
business is the stage for women right?
work hard.
Sakiko.
good morning.
are you leaving?
so suddenly?
is somebody nice waiting?
change your towels.
thank you very much.
you're welcome.
I'll take care of your mother.
tokyo isn't very far.
I'll call you if something happens.
Thanks.
I'll call you even nothing happens.
Thanks.
the next station is arriving.
Tatsuko!
I'm a terrible mother.
I've worried my daughter for a long time because of vanity.
when she glared at me the other day
I was scared.
she told me that she said a terrible thing to you.
she did.
she's stubborn.
she doesn't change her opinions easily.
but in fact she's simple and obedient.
I'm glad she doesn't resemble me on that point.
dear Tatsuko
I'm writing this letter as soon as we parted.
I'm glad we met today.
I usually walk the path to the shrine
but when you were with me...
it looked different.
you walked up the steps.
what did you pray for at the shrine?
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
I'll call you.
my signal will ring twice.
time flies when we're together.
I miss you so much. I'm dying to see you.
tomorrow come quickly.
please release the shutter.
it was a pleasant trip.
I'll send you the photo.
I wish I could hand it to you.
there's only one photo of us together.
I can't forget Mt. Bizan when we saw it together.
how did you like my home?
I'm sorry I can't go.
I have no time to spare.
how are you?
I want to hear your voice...
self-dedication?
to leave a body to science.
one dedicates one's body to the university after one dies.
students need bodies to dissect to become doctors.
your mother understands the surgery so deeply.
consultation?
your first visit?
let me make your card. Fill out this paper please.
your health insurance card.
yeah again.
see you next week. - Thank you.
take the medicine regularly.
don't stop it midway.
it bothers me.
I'll take it.
thank you doctor.
are you all sick?
our knees hurt together because we're good friends.
so you'll get cured together.
then must I cure just one lady?
that'll be me.
will you wait a little longer?
next patient please.
what is it?
it's my throat. It aches.
no previous illness.
allergies?
is your name Kono?
Yes.
where you from?
Tokushima.
I took the old lady to the bus stop.
Really?
your family?
I have a mother.
she's not well.
fortunately she has a good doctor.
your throat seems all right.
no medicine is needed.
don't cool yourself too much.
the festival season is coming.
in Tokushima.
I haven't seen the dances for thirty years.
if you have time please come to see them.
are you on Yumeko Bridge now?
I'm writing this letter in Tokyo.
I wanted to marry you...
even at the cost of all I have now.
but I can't even realize your wish...
to see Awa Odori together.
Tatsuko...
I'm sorry.
but I can't leave this small clinic...
or turn down my devoted wife.
I can't betray her trust.
how's her?
in the ICU on the third floor.
this way.
mother.
stupid.
you didn't have to come.
mom, let me in.
Stacy Crandall, 17, high school senior.
found 6: 00 A. M. This morning in Garfield park, raped and unconscious.
enough ecstasy and diazepam in her system to kill her.
is she going to make it?
by some miracle, looks like she is.
she's in the hospital. Her parents are with her.
ecstasy and diazepam? Was she drugged?
possibly.
last seen around a quarter to 2: 00 leaving a neighbor's birthday party, looking a little woozy.
blood alcohol indicates she had one or two drinks.
so somebody might have slipped something in her drink.
or maybe she self-medicated.
lives a few blocks away.
20 minutes after she left the party, Stacy called the Sextons' house.
she was locked out. Missed her curfew.
her parents locked her out? Are you serious?
parents did it to me.
why am I not surprised?
right after she called him, Sexton got in his SUV and left.
nosy parker neighbor saw him go.
presumably to pick her up.
back ten minutes later;drove directly into the garage.
neighbor couldn't see if Stacy was with him or not.
but she did see him make another round trip a couple hours later--that one took an hour.
this time to dump the body.
presumably. - DNA?
came up negative;ditto the scene where the victim was left.
can we put Stacy in his SUV?
clean as a whistle.
but I'll tell you what they did find--a partial print from Sexton off Stacy's necklace, and dog chains which matched the ligature marks on the girl's body.
and Sexton doesn't have a dog.
it isn't much.
does Sexton have an alibi?
his wife says he was with her all night.
for what that's worth.
have they searched the house? - Yeah. Nothing.
look, we know maybe the cops have jumped the gun on this one, but they were going with their gut.
this guy did it.
Yeah, well, their gut's giving me a stomachache.
we have 72 hours before we have to charge Sexton or release him.
when she came home from their party, your daughter was locked out.
she missed her curfew.
we couldn't stay up any longer so we went to bed.
you didn't hear her knocking?
we woke up.
we figured we'd leave her out there a few minutes--teach her a lesson.
five minutes tops, and we went down to the door, she was gone.
thought she went back to the Sextons', so we called over there and there was no answer.
how does Stacy know the Sextons?
best friends with Kelly's little sister.
so she got to know Kelly Pretty well.
she's not that much older than Stacy.
Kelly's sister at the party?
Lexie? - No.
she passed away a year ago.
it was an accident.
tim and Kelly's engagement party, of all things.
cold medication.
she wasn't supposed to be drinking.
how well do you know the Sextons?
not well. Neighbors, you know.
all the kids are really crazy about them.
they're such an attractive couple.
are you sure?
physical exam confirms you were raped.
why'd you leave the party?
I-I started to feel kind of weird, you know. Like...
dizzy.
too much to drink?
I... I don't think so.
but...
you had diazepam and ecstasy in your system.
I don't do drugs. Honest.
why'd you call the Sextons?
I wanted Kelly to come pick me up.
did you talk to her?
tim answered...
I think. I don't...
I don't really remember. I'm sorry.
I thought you might want these back.
this isn't mine.
you were wearing it when you came in, sweetie.
a toe ring? It's yours, honey.
you don't remember anything about the assault, anything at all?
no. Nothing.
do the police have any idea who did this?
your parents didn't tell you?
they arrested Tim Sexton.
it couldn't be Tim.
I don't believe it.
why would he do this to me?
this is so bogus.
you spoke to my wife, she told you--I was home all night.
after the party, we went to bed and went to sleep.
whoever attacked Stacy is still out there.
I doubt that.
how's Stacy doing?
is she going to be okay?
no thanks to you.
she called your number shortly after 2: 00 A. M.
I was sound asleep.
maybe she left a message.
a few minutes after that, one of your neighbors saw you drive off.
some of my neighbors have overactive imaginations.
ten minutes later you were back.
enough time to pick up Stacy and bring her back to your house.
did this neighbor see Stacy with Tim when he supposedly returned from this mysterious late-night mission?
he drove directly into the garage.
are you honestly trying to sell that scenario?
he brought somebody home to rape with his wife sleeping in the next room?
a couple hours later, a neighbor, still awake, sees you drive off again.
this round trip takes an hour.
enough time to dump Stacy Crandall in Garfield park and leave her for dead.
this neighbor's word against my wife's.
you don't have anything, counselor. Either charge my client or let him go.
he's staying under lock and key.
48 hours.
that's how long you got before I walk out of here.
I know how this works.
no wonder he knew the drill.
he's definitely been here before.
five in Iowa, six in Dallas-- busy boy.
if he did what the authorities suspect him of doing...
either he's been laying low since he moved here two years ago...
serial rapists don't usually just give up their favorite pastime...
or we have other victims in Indianapolis.
we've been talking to authorities Indallas and Ames, Iowa.
Sexton was suspected of drugging and raping teenage girls in both locales.
but never charged?
each time they moved away, rapes with this particular M. O. ecstasy, diazepam combo, bondage-- suddenly stopped.
ray's analyzing all unsolved rapes and rape-homicides since Sexton's been in town.
how long ha she been married? - A little over a year.
she's a local girl. They met and married here.
I wonder how much she knows about her new husband?
I don't know what else to tell you, Ms. Chase. Tim was with me all night.
how much did your husband tell you about his past before he moved to Indianapolis?
everything.
did he tell you he was the primary suspect in nearly a dozen rapes the last two places he lived?
I know my husband. He never could have done anything like that.
he was questioned extensively by the police on a number of occasions.
was he ever arrested? - No.
then he didn't do it.
we think he did.
and so do the authorities in Dallas and Iowa.
please just talk to me.
what really happened that night?
what did Tim do when he left the house?
I told you, Tim didn't leave me the whole night.
we both know he did.
when Stacy called, he went and got her, didn't he?
you don't understand--it's not that easy.
how close are we to charging this punk?
ray's still looking at open cases.
Mrs. Sexton's sticking to her story.
I think she's afraid of him.
battered spouse?
Ed's looking for any emergency room visits in the last year.
we'll offer her protection in exchange for testifying.
her testimony could put us over the top.
we could charge Sexton and convict him.
battered spouses make fragile witnesses.
if Kelly falters, we'll have an expert witness standing by who'll explain why.
I've already made an appointment with Dr. Ashland to profile Tim Sexton; I'll talk to her about Kelly as well.
I've prosecuted tons of these cases in Manhattan.
guys like Sexton are cowards and bullies.
I've always taken a personal satisfaction in seeing them locked up.
there you go.
sexton, Kelly. - You got lucky.
she lives clear across town. - Typical.
doesn't want friends, family, neighbors to know her hubby's using her for a punching bag.
dislocated shoulder, lacerations, abrasions.
waterskiing accident.
fell off a horse--dislocated same shoulder, lacerations and black eye.
Yeah, I remember her.
thought her story was hinky.
doctor tried to talk to her about it, but her husband was hanging around.
she couldn't wait to get out of here.
here you go, last batch.
let's see what you got.
female Caucasian, 25 years old, drugged, raped, strangled.
uh, he prefers bondage to strangulation.
a little older than he likes.
what about young kids?
that's not our guy. He goes for older teens.
cherry-picks them all;dark hair, slender.
this might be oneo f his.
Jody Tarnowski, 19, drugged, lethal levels of ecstasy and diazepam, raped, body dumped in wooded area.
Dr. Ashton, I understand why a rapist would use a date-rape drug like a roofie.
it's called antri grade amnesia;the victim doesn't recallbeing raped, so she doesn't report it to the police.
but the rapist we have in custody drugged his victim to the point of nearly killing her.
the doctors tell us she must have been completely unconscious at the time of the assault.
now you're talking about something different--sleeping beauty syndrome.
having sex with someone while they're unconscious?
believe it or not.
how does anybody end up hard wired that way?
well, the sexual thrill for the rapist comes from being able to possess the victim completely.
he can do whatever he wants to her and she won't offer any resistance.
like sleeping beauty, only the guy isn't exactly trying to wake her with a kiss.
hardly. Waking her would only ruin the experience.
okay, one thing I don't understand: This rapist--if it's the same guy has attacked a number of women, but he's never tried to kill his victim before.
why the escalation?
could be he's become desensitized and he needs to add a greater element of danger to achieve the same thrill.
in which case, there's no going back.
none.
Jody Tarnowski, 19, rape-homicide.
same M. O. as past valentine's day.
last seen by a friend getting a ride from a good-looking stranger who fits the general description of Tim Sexton.
every parent's nightmare.
raped, bound, diazepam-ecstasy overdose, body dumped in river side park, no DNA.
locate the friend. See if she can I. D.Sexton from a photo.
excuse me, Miss chase. You have a visitor in reception.
Kelly, hi.
I was thinking about what you said about those other girls.
I'm so glad you came.
I'm not sure I should be here.
this is probably a really bad idea.
wait. Please don't leave.
Kelly, you're doing the right thing.
wait for who?
we can help you.
what do you mean?
we saw the emergency room reports.
Yeah, well, I'm kind of accident-prone.
only since you've been married?
Kelly, do you really want to stay with this man?
what happens when you have kids?
I just don't know what's going on with him.
he's not who I thought he was.
he's getting more violent every day. He's starting to scare me.
you need to leave him, Kelly. Get out of this marriage.
you can't protect me. He'll find me.
I give you my word.
but I need you to tell me the truth about what happened that night.
Stacy called the house after the party.
tim picked her up and brought her back to the house, put her on the couch.
she was out of it. She...
she'd had too much to drink or something.
I went to go get her a blanket, and when I came back...
it's okay. You can tell me.
he had taken her clothes off and he was, you know, on top of her.
he was raping her?
did he know you were there?
I think he wanted me to watch what he was doing.
I was just so shocked.
what did you do?
when I realized what was happening, I tried to stop it. I mean...
I yelled and I screamed and I pounded on his back.
he didn't feel it.
he wouldn't stop.
he was just in this state.
I'd never seen him like that before.
you could have called 911.
he said that he would kill me.
Kelly, we will protect you if you testify against him.
and if I don't?
we'll protect you anyway, but it will be a lot harder if he's not in jail.
about time. New evidence?
an eyewitness: Kelly Sexton.
she was there during the attempt?
he beat her up when she tried to stop Stacey's rape.
she felt partly to blame. She wants to testify.
good. What about the Tarnowski murder?
we're working it. We're still looking for that witness.
what's your trial strategy for Sexton?
we start with Stacey's testimony.
I'm not crazy about putting her on the stand.
well, we have to use her. I mean, she's young, sympathetic.
jury needs to hear from the victim.
she doesn't remember anything about the assault or her attacker.
it leaves her wide open for the defense.
we'll prep her.
any problems we have with her as a witness, we can offset with Kelly's testimony.
we know the physical evidence can be argued either way but we have a strong expert witness in Dr. Ashton.
and with Kelly's testimony, we go from a toss-up to a slam dunk.
there's no such thing in my experience. However, if you feel you have to.
but if defense goes after her on cross and they try to put the rape victim on trial,
I want you on your feet objecting every step of the way.
Absolutely.
why did you leave Tim Sexton's birthday party?
I started to feel kind a weird.
like I was gonna be sick.
I went home, but I was locked out, so I called Kelly for a ride.
did you speak to Kelly?
no, Tim answered.
what did you talk about?
I don't remember.
did Kelly come to pick you up?
I don't remember.
so the last thing you remember, you made a phone call.
Yes, and Tim Sexton answered.
and what's the next thing you remember?
waking up in the hospital.
thank you.
during the party, did Tim Sexton say anything inappropriate to you?
no.
did he behave inappropriately?
no.
did he touch you in any inappropriateor sexual way?
no.
you said you left the Sexton's party because you felt weird.
well, how many drinks did you have at the party?
objection: Relevance.
overruled. You may answer.
a couple beers.
who were you drinking with?
no one in particular.
can you tell us when the alleged rape occurred?
no, I don't remember.
because you were drinking?
I-I was drugged.
you took drugs?
objection: Counsel is engaged in subtle character assassination.
goes to credibility, your honor.
I'll allow it. Witness may answer.
someone gave them to me without me knowing.
Really?
well, how would someone do that?
I don't know.
put them in my drink, I guess.
diazepam and ecstasy?
Yes.
you sure you didn't take them yourself?
objection, your honor, asked and answered.
sustained.
can you describe your attacker?
no. I was unconscious.
no further questions, your honor.
you told the police your husband never left the house the night of his birthday party.
is that true?
no.
you lied to the police.
I was scared. - Scared
I was scared that Tim would hurt me if I told them the truth.
so did your husband leave the house that night?
around 2: 00 A. M.After Stacey called, he got up and got dressed.
did he say where he was going?
he said, Stacey needs a ride. I'm going to go pick her up.
how long was he gone?
ten, 15 minutes.
and when he came back to the house, was Stacey with him?
no.
he said she was gone by the time he got there.
he just thought her parents let her in.
according to a sworn statement you made earlier, your husband picked up Stacey and brought her back to the house.
no.
Mrs. Sexton, in your sworn deposition, you stated your husband came back to the house with Stacey, who was unconscious, put her on a couch in the den and raped her.
I didn't say that, you did. You put those words in my mouth.
Mrs. Sexton, you gave a sworn statement.
because you pressured me. I didn't know what to do.
Mrs. Sexton, you went to emergency rooms where you were treated for suspicious injuries on three separate occasions.
are you recanting your previous statements because you fear your husband will hurt you again?
objection, your honor. Argumentative. Assumes facts not in evidence.
sustained.
in your sworn deposition, you stated your husband threatened to kill you.
objection, your honor. Asked and answered.
no, he didn't. He never hurt me.
I already told you what happened.
well, we knew this could happen.
our expert will explain what a challenge it is for a battered woman to testify against her husband and help the jury understand why Kelly recanted.
no one can predict what a jury will do, but we have a very strong case.
thank you.
when Wexler calls his own expert witness to counter Dr. Ashton, they'll cancel each other out.
Dr. Ashton can give the jury a profile of the sleeping beauty syndrome rapist and how Sexton fits the bill.
and Wexler's expert testifies other wise-- it's a draw.
maybe Dr. Ashton doesn't even mention sleeping beauty.
Dr. Sykes, Dr. Ashton testified that Kelly Sexton's injuries were consistent with physical abuse.
now, you reviewed the medical records.
in your opinion, are her in juries consistent with what she told her emergency room doctors?
water skiing, horseback riding, absolutely consistent.
in your textbook, you give three different profiles of batterers.
does Tim Sexton fit any of these profiles?
no, not at all.
no further questions.
Dr. Sykes, you're familiar with rapists' profiles?
certainly.
for instance?
the anger retaliatory rapist, the power assertive rapist...
what about the outwardly charming, intelligent rapist?
anger excitation.
is that the somno...somnophiliac? You're referring to sleeping beauty syndrome?
Ah, is that what they call it?
sleeping beauty syndrome is asexual deviancy involving intercourse with acompletely unconscious partner.
andrew Luster was a notorious example.
luster wanted his victims in a coma-like state during sex.
for what purpose?
to possess them, utterly. It's a form of playing god.
doctor, could you give us a profile of the typical sleeping beauty syndrome rapist?
a man who uses his charm and physical good looks to disarm and seduce his victims.
a man who's used to getting what he wants from women.
so, he's not a loser or a failure with women?
Oh, no, quite the contrary.
take Luster--he was incredibly wealthy, good-loooking, he could have had any woman he wanted.
in fact, it was probably too easy for him, so he upped the ante.
does Tim Sexton fit the profile of the sleeping beauty rapist?
objection.
the witness has already painted a picture of the prototype.
I am only asking for the doctor's expert opinion, and he is their witness.
I'll allow it. You may answer.
I would say that he does.
I swear, I think the little creep was actually flattered Dr. Sykes said he had sleeping beauty syndrome.
you did a great job getting that in, by the way.
much more credible coming from their expert than ours.
I don't know. Wexler had an answer for all the physical evidence.
well, we knew he would.
it may just come down to how the jury feels about Kelly, whether they believe her sworn deposition or what she said on the stand.
Yeah.
I feel badly for Stacy and her parents if we lose this, because Kelly couldn't come through for us.
nice work, both of you.
Thanks. - Thank you.
you did your part.
it's too bad Kelly couldn't do hers.
you thought this might happen.
well, I thought she might falter, you know, forget.
I didn't think she'd out and out recant.
Annabeth chase.
thank you.
the jury's back.
after a great deal of debate and dozens of ballots, we are dead locked and unable to come to a decision.
I'm declaring a mistrial.
I let you and Stacy down.
it's my fault that Tim is free.
he's not free yet.
he's only out on bond.
we can always try the case again.
no, you can't; not if you've already tried him once.
a mistrial isn't an acquittal.
what are you talking about? I thought...
you thought it was double jeopardy. No, it's not.
we can start over, bring in new evidence.
what new evidence?
there isn't any.
we'll keep looking.
we also suspect him in another case, here in Indianapolis.
eight months ago, a young woman named Jody Tarnowski.
he wouldn't... - he wouldn't?!
why wouldn't he? We know he's capable of it;he's done it before.
Kelly, do you know anything about Jody Tarnowski?
of course not.
so, you are going to try him again?
Absolutely. This isn't over.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I-I'm just so surprised, I...
he's gonna lay a lot of pressure on me.
that's why we need you to get away from him and stay away from him.
I will.
it's good that you can try him again; it really is.
I'm telling you, if she wanted him to walk,
she planned to recant her testimony all along.
she was playing us to get her husband acquitted?
but her injuries were real;she didn't fake those.
so what gives?
Oh, my man, I love him so?
apparently. You know when she set me up?
when I told herwe found out he'd been suspected in the other rapes.
she dropped that hint, I ran with it all the way to spousal abuse syndrome and talked her into taking the stand.
she created enough doubt in the jury's mind to get her husband a mistrial.
but why not just stick with the alibi?
that's what I've been asking myself-- why go to such great lengths?
maybe to keep us from focusing on something else.
but what?
the guys over in archives finally coughed up the Tarnowski evidence.
maybe this-- the Tarnowski murder.
she definitely flinched when I brought it up.
and the medical report you've been asking for on Kelly's sister.
what's that about?
Stacy's parents told me Kelly Sexton's younger sister died last year.
with all the drugs in this case, I thought it was worth taking another look.
hmm, just what they said.
alcohol and cold medication, lethal interaction.
death by misadventure.
without Kelly's testimony, we don't have enough evidence to get a conviction.
we have to re-try Sexton. The man is a sexual predator.
and he's become homicidal. If we let him go...
look, I will not put Stacy Crandall and her family through the agony of a second trial
not unless I'm certain we're gonna win.
we can build the case differently.
strategy is not enough.
if we retry him, at least we can hold onto him until we can get a witness who can do a photo I. D. on Jody Tarnowski's murderer.
we can start building that case, too.
we need more ammunition than we had last time, and we need it up front.
are you authorizing us to get some?
officially? The Stacy Crandall case is on hold.
unofficially...
do what you need to do to nail this bastard.
thank you for letting me see Jody's room, Mrs. Tarnowski.
it really helps me get a sense of her.
she was very pretty.
Yes, she was.
when she kept her hair out of her eyes.
and so many trophies. She must have been a really good athlete.
like I was.
I went through the evidence, and I wondered why you didn't want to keep her ankle bracelet.
it wasn't jody's.
she didn't go in for that kind of thing.
I told the police, but they said you never know.
maybe it was a gift for valentine's day.
they welcome him back with open arms.
some chicks dig killers.
I'll never understand.
Annabeth, he left the gym. He's back in his office.
now what's on his menu?
he's got to keep his girlish figure.
later.
you are being so good for mommy.
I don't know where you get your patience.
Yeah, I do.
your daddy.
just hang in there for a second, okay? We'll be home soon.
I wondered who you were talking to.
baby-sitter flake out on you?
isn't this bring your daughter to work week?
nanny's got the flu, and the vdf's are due, so here we are.
been there.
baby-sitters, late nights.
somehow, it all gets done. They grow up fine.
you have kids? You've been holding out on us.
it's no mystery.
got a 17-year-old daughter, Jesse.
she's a senior in high school, lives in New York with her mom.
I tell you, I'd like to believe she has street smarts, but, uh...
you know teenage girls.
they think they're so worldly, think they know everything.
truth is, they haven't got a clue.
well, hang in there, huh? - Night.
where are you?
some crummy diveout by the airport.
Oh, I was afraid of that. He may be thinking about leaving town.
I'll keep you posted. Okay. Thanks.
who drinks orange soda?
you buy, you choose.
you miss this, being on the street?
I can go back anytime I want.
they're always looking for crossing guards.
you regret it?
I didn't turn anybody in.
grand jury asked me a question under oath, I just told the truth.
all right, I can respect that.
so how long you and Conlon been going steady?
Conlon's all right.
moved half-way across the country with him.
Yeah. Gave up the big apple for this.
sounds like love to me.
always goes for the same type.
what a charmer.
Hey!
come here.
come on! Come on!
Hey! - Stop it!
get the hell out of here!
what are you doing?
just leave us alone.
so we have a new on Kelly.
she likes her sex rough.
the bruises, the dislocated shoulder--it's all part of their mutual rape fantasy.
you could tell they couldn't wait for us to split so they could pick up where they left off.
hot and bothered. - But why the wig?
why did she disguise herself?
her husband likes to rape teenage girls, she likes it rough, so she dresses up like a teenager.
keeps the marriage fresh.
who knows? Maybe Sexton's kindergarten teacher had long brown hair.
what? You never had a crush on a teacher?
I took this from her file.
Yeah, she does look kind of like Kelly, with her wig-- long brown hair.
Stacy Crandall, too. Definitely Sexton's type.
where are we with the idea of Sexton in the Tarnowski murder?
it'll take some time.
Jody's friend moved out of the state.
keep pushing it, huh?
I'll show Stacy this picture of Jody.
maybe Jody knew the Sextons, as well.
nice job, putting the tail on Sexton.
Thanks.
next time, follow protocol, and check with me first.
always.
what's her name?
I can't say for sure.
there are always girls like that hanging around the Sextons.
I mean, Lexie and her friends were always over there.
they were really tight.
she got along with her brother-in-law?
Lexie was so excited about their engagement party.
God, if she only knew what Tim was really like.
were you there at the party the night she died?
Yeah. Not when she OD'd.
that was later.
after everyone left.
Kelly and Tim had to take her to the emergency room.
I cried for days.
Lexie was comatose by the time they called 911.
I went back, took another look at the medical report.
thing is, the M. E. never did a tox screen.
she was taking this cold medication.
she shouldn't have been drinking.
the combination was enough to cause a lethal inter action.
so the family story fit what happened.
death by misadventure.
I have a feeling Lexie belongs up here with the rest of Tim Sexton's harem.
look at this photo Stacy took that night at the party.
that's what Kelly was wearing when we busted them. Same top.
what's that called? - Baby-doll.
are you sure?
Yeah. With the long brown wig, a lot like her dead sister.
she dressed up like her dead sister to have rough sex with her husband?
I think we should exhume Lexie's body.
I know it's been over a year, but...
well, we still got a shot at finding drug evidence.
I'll get a judge to order the exhumation.
ecstasy disappears from the bloodstream in a matter of days, but it remains in the fat cells a long time.
I also found Traces of diazepam-- toxic levels of both.
and I found something else, wrapped around the victim's left hand.
I didn't know what to make of it.
I thought the victim's name was Lexie.
K... for Kelly.
why put a silver charm in with the body?
like Stacy's silver toe ring and Jody's silver ankle bracelet.
something Sexton left behind to show that he possessed them.
I bet he got Kelly to put it in with Lexie as a good-bye gesture.
Sexton certainly indulges himself with his silver jewelry calling cards.
maybe he's got more of them squirreled away somewhere.
I'll get the warrants.
match made in heaven.
that's Lexie passed out on the couch.
wait a minute. Kelly was with him?
she was in on it.
she molested her own sister.
that's what it is. They violated her together.
to celebrate their engagement.
Jody was their valentine's day gift to each other, and Stacy was Sexton's birthday present from his wife.
there must be other tapes of Jody and Stacy.
I'll get Ed and Ray right on it.
we have to screen the rest of this.
you do it. I don't have the stomach for this.
love you, babe. - You, too, babe.
so how does it feel being the one wearing the chains?
what are you here for?
I don't know how any one could do the things your husband did, but you're worse than he is.
your little sister?
you know what, Miss chase?
no regrets.
no regrets?
none. Everything that we shared brought us closer.
even murders?
your husband was a serial rapist, but he never killed anyone until he hooked up with you.
you've obviously never been in love.
not real love.
I've been in love.
love doesn't turn you into this--whatever the two of you are.
you don't understand.
we'd do anything for each other.
no boundaries.
I wanted to give Tim the ultimate experience--something no one else would give him.
raping and killing your sister was the ultimate experience?
we didn't kill her. It was an accident.
Lexie drank too much that night.
took that cold medicine.
you didn't take that into account when you slipped her the ecstasy and diazepam, did you?
maybe you didn't intend to kill the first time, but you got off on it.
it was a three-way.
totally consensual. Lexie was into it.
and that stuff that you saw on the videotape?
Lexie was just pretendingto be unconscious' cause she knew that's what Tim liked.
and Jody Tarnowski?
and Stacy Crandall? Were they into it, too?
our investigators found the safe deposit box under your maiden name.
tell me something.
how did you and Tim use those videos, huh, Kelly?
to relive the experience till the thrill wore off and then you needed a new victim?
you'll be tried for your sister Lexie's rape-murder, Jody Tarnowski's rape-murder, and retried for Stacy Crandall's rape and attempted homicide.
life without parole times three.
you should have seen Sexton's face. He finally stop smirking?
Kelly started crying.
first real emotion I've ever seen from her.
well, three counts each of life without parole would make you cry, and wipe the smirk off your face.
did Stacy show up?
with her parents.
won't be seeing him again. Or her.
Hey. Congratulations.
way to go, putting the love birds in a cage for good.
thanks to you, and your keen appreciation of women's fashions.
the baby-doll top.
when you've got an eye for style...
Oh, is that what he has an eye for?
come on, now. You're going to embarrass me.
anyway, you did right by those young women.
we feel good about it. - You should.
Jody's mother found out what happened to her daughter, and Stacy and her parents got some measure of justice.
the judge even agreed to seal the evidence.
the video tapes they made of Stacy, Jody and Lexie will never get out.
the last one I ever took of her.
helped us solve the case.
Lexie was my friend.
I thought Kelly and Tim were, too.
I feel so stupid for trusting them.
no, don't blame yourself.
no one ever could have known what kind of predators they were. Are.
they're never getting out, are they?
their lawyer said that they were going to appeal.
they're never getting out. Trust us.
I also wanted to thank you for persuading the judge to make an exception.
no one will ever see the tape.
we promise.
thank you.
thank you so much for looking out for me.
and for what you did for her.
Oh, lonesome night.
and babbits bawling, the wind biting the bone.
wind like this...
full of voices.
ancestry howling at you...
yibbering stories...
all voices tied up into one.
one voice differing...
one voice...
whispering out there, spying from the dark...
that fanged devil...
old Georgie himself.
Mm. Now you ear up close...
and I'll yarn you about the first time we met...
eye to eye.
and thus it was that I made the acquaintance of Dr. Henry Goose...
the man I hoped might cure me of my affliction.
have you lost something?
question one:
what secret in Sixsmith's report would be worth killing him for?
question two:
is it reasonable to believe that they would kill again to protect that secret?
and if so, question three: What the fuck am I doing here?
while my extensive experience as an editor has led me to a disdain...
for flashbacks and flash-forwards and all such tricksy gimmicks...
I believe that if you, dear reader, can extend your patience for just a moment...
you will find there is a method to this tale of madness.
my Dearest Sixsmith:
I shot myself through the roof of my mouth this morning with Vyvyan Ayrs' Luger.
a true suicide is a paced, disciplined certainty.
people pontificate, "Suicide is a coward's act."
couldn't be further from the truth.
suicide takes tremendous courage.
any problems, you just hit this button. - Thank you.
on behalf of my ministry and the future of Unanimity...
I would like to thank you for this final interview.
hello. - Press pass.
expecting trouble?
I was Dermot Hoggins' publisher, not his shrink or his astrologer.
and the ruddy, bloody truth is...
I had no idea what the man was gonna do that night.
this beach was once a cannibal's banqueting hall...
where the strong gorged on the weak.
but the teeth, sir, they spat out...
like you or I would expel a cherry stone.
do you know the price a quarter pound of these will earn?
remember, this is not an interrogation or a trial.
your version of the truth is all that matters.
truth is singular.
its versions are mistruths.
don't let them say I killed myself for love.
had my infatuations, but we both know in our hearts...
who is the sole love of my short, bright life.
there you are, Mr. Ewing.
as binding a covenant there can ever be between men outside the province of Scripture.
thank you, Reverend Horrox.
I know my father-in-law is profoundly excited about this deal.
Haskell Moore is a great man.
future generations depend on men like him...
men capable of speaking the truth.
quite.
when I first encountered Haskell Moore's writing...
its perspicuity struck me as though delivered through divine revelation.
the learned doctor and I have spent many a night debating Mr. Moore's tractus.
I'm only willing to concede that he makes a compelling case as to why we are sitting here...
enjoying this divine lamb...
while Kupaka stands there...
content to serve.
indeed. Well, Kupaka...
you enjoy your life here with us...
do you not? - Oh, yes, Reverend, sir.
Kupaka very happy here.
you see, this is Moore's "Ladder of Civilization..."
the reason behind this natural order.
please, Giles, do shut up.
I've been listening to this for weeks.
I would love to know what his own son-in-law has to say about it.
Oh, well, let's see, uh...
it is an inquiry concerning God's will and the nature of men.
and what does he have to say about the nature of women?
I'm afraid that's a subject he prefers to pass by in silence.
he wouldn't be the first.
uh, pray, Mr. Ewing, continue.
well, the question he does pose is...
if God created the world, how do we know what things we can change...
and what things must remain sacred and inviolable?
Reverend Horrox real specific how to run plantation.
georgian Way, best way, he say.
Oh, God, this heat is unbearable. How do they take it?
Reverend Horrox say slaves like camel, bred for desert.
he say they not feel heat like civilized folk.
now we should get you out of the sun.
and what...?
what is that noise?
Oh, there you are. - What happened?
Ah, ah, ah.
it is as I suspected. Gusano Coco Cervello...
better known as the Polynesian Worm.
I once saw a man's brain after the worm finished with him.
maggoty cauliflower.
but have no fear.
this particular devil and I are well-acquainted.
here we go.
Ah, yes, yes.
Oh, glug, glug, glug.
I don't know what I would have done had our paths not crossed.
well, for starters, you would have died.
I shall find a way to repay you.
Oh. No, unnecessary, I assure you.
I am a doctor, Adam.
a tiger cannot change its stripes. Heh-heh-heh.
Sixsmith, I do hope you will be able to find it in your heart to forgive me.
Mr. Frobisher!
Mr. Robert Frobisher!
management would like a word with you, please, sir!
Mr. Frobisher, open this door, please!
we do know you're in there, Mr. Frobisher. Please comply!
a letter is being drafted to your father, sir.
Mr. Frobisher!
hated leaving you like that. Wasn't the goodbye I had in mind.
someone's in a hurry.
by the time you read this, I will be on my way to Edinburgh.
on my way to fame and fortune.
I know you haven't heard of him, but trust me:
Vyvyan Ayrs is one of the musical greats, Sixsmith.
the tragedy is that he hasn't produced any new work in years due to illness.
my scheme is to persuade him to hire me as his amanuensis...
and aide him in the creation of a masterpiece...
Hey! - before shooting up through the musical firmament
eventually obliging Pater to admit that, yes, the son he disinherited...
is none other than Robert Frobisher, the greatest British composer of his time.
I know, Sixsmith, you groan and shake your head...
but you smile too, which is why I love you.
P. S.
thanks for the waistcoat.
I needed something of yours to keep me company.
St. George and the Dragon.
reminds me that composing is a crusade.
sometimes you slay the dragon, sometimes...
the dragon slays you.
all right then. Frobisher, is it?
I trust Mackeras taught you enough to be useful.
I've had this little melody for viola rattling about my head for months.
let's see if you can get it down.
subtle grace note before the third.
soft and simple, got it?
now it gets interesting.
good. Play that back.
I'd love to, sir.
um...
what key are we in?
what key?
G-minor, of course!
and the time signature?
for Christ's sake, did you hear it or not?
I just need a little more time... - You need?
my dear boy, who is working for whom here?
I apologize, sir... - Are you an amanuensis or an apologist?
now pay attention.
3/4 changing to 4/4 on the fourth bar and back to 3/4 on bar five...
if you can count that high.
crotchet G, pause for a quaver, repeat G quaver, then E flat on the downbeat.
and so on.
all right, let me hear it.
stop! Please, you're hurting me.
you must have misheard me: I said I had a melody, not a malady!
Vyvyan?
Jocasta! Deliver me.
what's going on in here?
an exercise in futility.
should I be introduced?
there's really no point. The boy's as useful as the clap.
fortunately, he'll be much easier to get rid of.
would you be a dear and get Henry to show the boy out?
Yes, of course, darling.
it's beautiful.
Yes.
that's it!
that's my melody!
come on, Luisa! We're meant to be together.
please, Luisa come on, come on. I'm telling you.
I'm telling you, baby, you can't leave me. It's a past life thing or a future life thing.
it's you and me.
look, for the last hour...
all I could think about was throwing you off your balcony.
who the hell do you think you are?
you write a bullshit column for a fucking rag!
elevator!
thank you.
nice to know the age of chivalry isn't dead.
you okay?
no bones broken, I think.
no, no. You sit, you sit, you sit.
let me see.
great. Power outage.
perfect end to a perfect day.
still glad the age of chivalry isn't dead?
I'd still rather be right here than back up there.
guys like that are just an occupational hazard.
you were interviewing him?
Yeah, for Spyglass Magazine.
Luisa Rey.
Rufus Sixsmith.
Rey?
you wouldn't happen to be related to the journalist Lester Rey?
Yeah. He was my father.
Really?
he must have been enormously proud of you, following in his footsteps.
Mm.
that's her. My niece, Megan.
she's lovely.
a born physicist with a better mind for mathematics than I ever had.
did her PhD at Cambridge. A woman at Caius.
hm. Gives you hope for the world.
it's hot.
and we're still here. Heh.
that's a very peculiar birthmark.
Yeah.
my little comet.
my mother swore it was cancer.
she wanted me to get it removed, but I don't know, I kind of like it.
I knew someone who had a birthmark that was similar to that.
Really? Who was it?
someone I cared about very much.
uh, a hypothetical question for you, Ms. Rey.
as a journalist...
what price would you pay to protect a source?
any.
prison?
if it came to that, yes.
would you be prepared to compromise your safety?
my father braved booby-trapped marshes...
and the wrath of generals for his journalistic integrity.
what kind of daughter would I be if I bailed when things got a little tough?
hm.
saved. Heh.
Taxi!
you sure you don't need a cab? - No, I've got my car.
well, you know, if there's ever something I can do for you...
please give me a call.
thank you, I will.
Bye.
it was the Night of the Lemon Prizes...
and admist all that forced jollity...
I recall a moment of introspection.
Why?
why would anyone in their right mind choose to be a publisher?
this was the precise moment that Dermot found me.
Oi! Timothy.
Ah. Hey, Dermot.
bad news inexorably does.
fucking bullshit, it's a fucking waste. - Ha... ha... ha.
never forget, Herman Melville writes a ripping yarn...
about a big white whale which is summarily dismissed, and yet today...
it is lugged around in the backpacks of every serious student of literature in the world.
I don't give a fuck what happens when I'm dead.
I want people to buy me book now.
well, as your publisher, obviously nothing would make me happier.
but sadly, for whatever reason...
knuckle Sandwich has yet to connect to its audience.
you want a reason? I'll give you a reason. Right there!
Oh. You mean Mr. Finch?
Felix-fucking-Finch!
the cunt that shat all over me book in his poncy fucking magazine!
it wasn't that bad.
no?
Mr. Hoggins should apologize to the trees felled for the making of his bloated autobio-novel.
400 vainglorious pages expire in an ending that is flat and inane beyond belief.
steady now, Dermot.
what is a critic but one who reads quickly, arrogantly...
but never wisely?
fuck him.
Dermot.
ladies and gentlemen!
we have an additional award tonight, fellow book faeries...
an award for Most Eminent Critic!
mister... Oh! Beg pardon, "Sir" Felix Finch, O-B and E!
and what might my prize be, I wonder?
a signed copy of an unpulped Knuckle Sandwich?
can't be many of those left.
well?
just what does that lead-less pencil you call an imagination have in mind...
to end this scene? Hm?
I think you're gonna love this. - Ha... ha... ha.
now, that's an ending that is flat and inane beyond belief.
my thoughts?
if I am honest, I admit that the obvious emotions...
like shock and horror, flew as Finch had, here and gone...
tequila. Couple of fingers.
while deep down...
I experienced a nascent sense of a silver lining to this most tragic turn.
overnight, Dermot "Dusty" Hoggins became a cult hero to the common man.
grabbed the critic and sent him plummeting to his death.
and Knuckle Sandwich shifted 90, 000 copies in less than two months.
I was, for the briefest of moments, Cinderella...
and all memory of past misfortune receded...
in the rearview mirror of my dream come true.
what the...? - Tim-o-tee Cavendish I presume.
uh, my office hours are 11 to 2.
my secretary would be more than happy to schedule an appointment, if you so desire.
friends like us don't need appointments. - We like it all cozy like this.
visited Dermot in the joint.
our brother's got a question for you.
Where's our fucking money?
boys, boys, look here.
dermot signed what we call a copyright transfer contract, which means that, legally...
dermot didn't sign no fucking contract for the event of the fucking season!
uh, uh... All right, perhaps, uh...
we could moot a provisional sum as a basis for ongoing negotiation.
okey-dokey.
what sum we gonna moot?
50k would do for starters.
fifty sounds reasonable.
tomorrow afternoon.
tomorrow afternoon?
cash. No bollocks.
no checks. - Old-fashioned money.
gentlemen, the law says...
the law?
What'd the law do for Felix-fucking-Finch?
Mm-hm.
ordinarily, I begin by asking prisoners to recall their earliest memories...
to provide a context for the corpocratic historians of the future.
Fabricants have no such memories, Archivist.
one 24-hour cycle in Papa Song's is identical to every other.
may I say you speak Consumer surprisingly well.
it is unfortunate that most of Unanimity...
can only speak one language.
as an officer of Unanimity I am, of course, restricted from using subspeak.
of course.
please describe a typical 24-hour Papa Song cycle.
at hour four, each server is woken by auto-stimulin.
Sonmi-451, Yoona-939...
from revival, we proceed to the hygiene.
after dressing, we file into the dinery.
at hour five, we man our stations to greet the new day's consumers.
welcome to Papa Song's.
for the next 19 hours, we input orders, tray food, vend drinks...
Upstock condiments, wipe tables, and bin garbage...
all done in strict adherence to First Catechism.
Ooh! Ha... ha... ha.
what is the First Catechism?
honor thy Consumer.
after the final cleaning, we imbibe one Soapsac...
then return to our Sleep box.
that is the blueprint of every single day.
did you ever think about the future?
Papa Song servers have just one possible future.
you mean "Exultation"?
could you describe this annual rite of passage?
on First Day, Seer Rhee would stamp a star on each of our collars.
twelve stars meant an end to our contract.
how did you feel when you watched one of your sisters Ascend?
excitement.
I was happy for them.
but envious as well.
did your sister servers feel as you did?
most of them.
I would like to ask about the infamous Yoona-939.
Sonmi-451.
if Yoona-939 woke you...
who woke her?
seer Rhee.
why would a Seer wake a Server?
perhaps you should ask him, Archivist.
what's wrong with him?
he drinks Soap.
it makes him happy.
then he sleep like us, in our box.
do you ever think about...
what it must be like up there with the Consumers?
third Catechism forbids such questions.
Yes, it does.
come. Let me show you a secret.
accessing storage. Lost and Found.
now...
Sonmi-ja...
we are inside a secret.
a kino? We're not allowed. - Sonmi-ja.
no one will ever know.
come.
this is a violation of the ruddy Incarceration Act!
I will not be subjected to criminal abuse!
this is a violation of the ruddy Incarceration Act!
I will not be subjected to criminal abuse!
you could have been excised.
how did you justify such a risk to yourself?
she was my friend.
please describe the events of September 18th, from your perspective.
I was stationed at pedestal one.
Yeah, do it! Ha... ha... ha.
go on! - You know she wants it!
give her the shake!
whoa. Oh!
go! Go!
Oh! Unh.
I will not be subjected to criminal abuse.
elevator approaching.
step away.
code yellow. Area is secure.
nay, this life of rotted luck ain't no smiley some yarnie.
and rares time I ever fess the secret of Sloosha's Hallow.
Adam, my brother by law, and his son and me be trekking back from Honokaa Market.
was Adam's custom to kowtow his ancestry with offerings and honorings.
suddenly...
that fangy devil's eyes, I felt them.
who there?
Zachry.
Oh...
a darky spot you're in, friend.
old Georgie?
ain't no blade can protect you from the True-true.
pa!
Jonas! Jonas, go! Go, go!
Zachry!
Zachry? Zachry!
stay here.
safe here.
Zachry!
Kona'll be feasting on Adam and his boy by sunup.
Zachry!
No! Nay!
Zachry!
Zachry!
you say all the time, yeah?
"the weak are meat, the strong do eat"?
father! Aah! Unh.
No! Jonas!
the True-true is what that is.
whole Valley whispering about the blood of Adam and his son on my hands.
but Rose and Catkin never believed no yibbering, and stood by me.
uncle Zach, look!
Yeah, I see them.
Prescients come bartering twice a year...
their ships creep-crawling on waves...
just floating on the smart of the Old Uns.
Barter'll be starting soon.
Yeah.
you must go find your ma.
What're you doing?
ma says you ain't been right since Sloosha's.
say I gotta keep eye wise on you.
you minding me while I mind the goats.
I see.
stump is, who's gonna mind your ma at the barter?
she got no tongue for haggling, not like you and me.
sure you're all right?
swear by. Be home for supping.
why words slinking slide off the tongue when we need them most?
if my tongue been more bold...
could I have stop all the tiresome about to happen?
uncle Zach!
this my big bro I yarning about.
what's this about, sis?
special guest hosting.
thank you for the kindsome host of my valley stay.
I ain't saysoed this, Rose.
abbess sayso a gift of great honor.
she can be hosting then.
I bring you gift, Zachry.
need no gift from a stranger.
now kin and bros and half-strangers, even the Abbess...
all come knocking...
to gape in wonderment, like Sonmi herself were sitting in our kitchen.
how your ship slide and glide so silentsome?
fusion engines.
no one queried what "fusion engines" was...
because they didn't want to look stupid front of the gathering.
fusion engines.
true really was, Meronym answer the questions...
but no answer ever quenched your curio.
all that answering done was taught everyone to not trust her.
she a sly one.
scheming and worming herself in.
watch her, watch her close.
she's got secrets.
Zachry Bailey! - Sorrysome for waking you, Abbess.
I dream something diresome's gonna happen.
come in, come in.
Oh, let Sonmi guide your heart.
Oh, I can hear her voice a'prayin' for you.
Oh, Old Georgie's a'hungerin' for your soul.
Oh. I know'd it.
Spit'n cuss on your dreams. - I know'd it.
bridge a'broken', hide below.
Hands'a'bleedin', can't let go.
enemy's sleeping, don't slit that throat.
an auguring.
Oh, Zachry.
trust Sonmi.
keep Her warning with you. Nail it to your memory.
thank you. Thank you, Abbess.
thank you.
Sonmi-451.
wait, wait.
there's no reason to hide.
I know you are Sonmi-451.
my name is Hae-Joo Chang.
what has happened to Seer Rhee?
soap overdose.
it is unfortunate that it had to happen with everything going so well...
because now it is probable that the Enforcers and the DNA sniffers...
will find out about you.
and if they do, if they realize your connection to Yoona-939...
you will be excised.
but you have a choice:
you can remain here and risk being discovered...
or you can come with me.
the foresail!
two, six, heave!
two, six, heave!
close the gaskets!
cape home!
bear away a point.
aye, aye, captain!
and hurry!
friday the 15th. We made sail with the morning tide.
Mr. Boerhaave had my cabin changed.
I have been quarantined to a storeroom away from the other passengers and crew.
Henry argued in vain that the Polynesian Worm is not contagious.
hardly matters.
all I want to do now is return home and unburden myself of this responsibility.
my Dear Sixsmith, I am in desperate need of your help.
after my last letter, I'm sure you're rushing to pack your bags...
but you needn't, really...
unless, of course, you wish to witness the rebirth of Robert Frobisher.
is it not miraculous how one's fortune can turn so quickly, so completely?
one moment, leaping from a hotel window...
the next, gainfully employed by one of the world's greatest living composers.
my only problem is that I accidentally got hooked on a journal written in 1849...
by a dying lawyer during the voyage from a Pacific Isle to San Francisco.
to my great annoyance, the pages cease mid-sentence. Half the book is missing.
it's completely killing me.
could you be a mensch...
and when you're next foraging at Otto's Books, make an inquiry?
a half-finished book is, after all, a half-finished love affair.
Schuhmann and Tom Marshall, my chief engineers...
and then we'll take some questions.
america loves oil.
america is addicted to oil.
some fantasize about wind turbines or pig gas.
but I'm here today to tell you that the cure for oil is right here.
the cure is nuclear power. The cure is Swannekke.
Hello? - Hello, Ms. Rey.
I'm frightfully sorry for calling at this hour.
Dr. Sixsmith?
I need help.
I need 50, 000 pounds!
not two thousand, 50 thousand!
I can go through it again, Mr. Cavendish, but the total's right.
2, 343 pounds and 16 pence.
how is this possible?! The ruddy money was pouring in.
debts mostly, Mr. Cavendish. Solvency has its drawbacks.
the situation looked dire...
but I knew that Timothy Cavendish's capital in this town...
could not be defined by an accountant's balance sheet.
McCluskie! Look, how are those delightful kiddies of yours?
it's "Cavendish the Ravenous," ha-ha-ha, your favorite Timothy.
you heard correctly.
Charles Dickens' own, original, authentic writing desk for 60, 000 pounds.
I think that's very fair.
but our records indicate that the desk is already accounted for...
by the Dickens House Museum.
okay, what about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's desk?
in the darkness, I suddenly saw the light.
blood has always trumped water.
if the Hogginses brutes wanted to turn this into a family affair...
they'd find the Cavendish clan more than ready for the task at hand.
I'm only gonna ask you nicely once. - Good to see you, Denny.
I'm not lending you a ruddy farthing until you pay back the last lot.
why should I be forever giving you handouts?
Denny, I've had a minor run-in with the wrong sort.
if I don't get my hands on 60, 000 pounds, I'm going to take an awful beating.
well, get them to video it for us, would you? Now fuck off.
I'm not joking, Denholme.
why is this my problem?
because we're brothers! Don't you have a conscience?
Denny...
help.
please?
den, who are you talking to?
Hello, Georgette.
Hello, Timothy.
right. All right. What, 60 grand?
it's gonna take some time, but in the interim...
I've got the perfect place for you to hide.
rise tacks and sheets!
I have begun to fear I may never hold my beloved Tilda in my arms again.
the Parasite writhes at night, igniting spasms of pain...
while visions and voices, obscene and monstrous, haunt me.
Mr. Ewing?
in the name of God! Help, help!
Mr. Ewing, no fear, no harm, no shout...
please.
my name Autua.
you know I, you seen Maori whip I.
you know I.
what do you want?
you help, Mr. Ewing.
if you no help, I in trouble dead.
well, you're already very much in trouble dead.
the Prophetess is a mercantile vessel, not an underground railroad for escaping slaves.
I able seaman. I earn passage.
well, then I suggest you surrender to the captain's mercies forthwith.
no, no!
they no hear I!
they say swim away home, nigger, and throw I in drink!
but you lawman, aye?
please, cap'n hear you, Mr. Ewing.
no, I can't help you.
I'm afraid your fate is entirely your own. I desire no part in it.
then kill I.
don't be absurd.
if you no help, you kill I just the same. It's true, you know it.
I ain't be no fish food, Mr. Ewing.
die here better. Do it.
do it quick.
I found an old Transway marker, captain.
it's got to be the right mountain.
problem is, the Valley people are afraid of it.
they think the devil lives up there.
I can't find anybody to guide me through the Kona territory.
Meronym...
every day you are out there, you increase your RAD levels.
this dream of yours is going to kill you.
and for what? The off-world colonies may no longer exist.
I gotta go, captain.
thank you for coming. I'm in 1404.
I'll be right up.
Dr. Sixsmith?
Dr. Sixsmith?
it's Luisa.
go call the police, right now. Call the police!
Oh, God.
my Dear Sixsmith, you alone could understand how I'm feeling right now.
today, Ayrs and I presented our first collaboration to Tadeusz Kesselring...
Ayrs' favorite conductor, who arrived from Berlin.
it's called "Eternal Recurrence." Wish you could hear it.
it's the most accomplished tone poem I know of written since the war...
and I tell you, Sixsmith, that more than a few of its best ideas are mine.
at our time of life, Ayrs, a man has no right to such daring ideas.
I suppose I've won a rearguard action or two in my war against decrepitude.
dinner of pheasant and Bordeaux, rich as butter-cream.
how I love to listen to men of distinguished lives...
sing of past follies and glories.
the only broken note in the entire evening was Ayrs' wife, Jocasta...
excusing herself early.
later I asked Ayrs about it.
he said Kesselring had introduced Jocasta to him.
I pried, "Had Kesselring been in love with her?"
the subject was a prickly one.
Jocasta is a Jew.
so obviously, a relationship was impossible.
why "obviously"?
can you really be so ignorant of what is happening in Germany?
at this point in my life, all I know, Sixsmith...
is that this world spins from the same unseen forces...
that twist our hearts.
how is it'n, Zachry?
Samewise.
mindin' some comp'ny?
nay.
but goats'n surly wise herders ain't known for our howziting temper.
feelin' I ownin' you a real kowtow for 'vadin' y'house with no sayso.
true sorrysome.
so, you mindin' a stranger queryin' 'bout your troddin'?
swap you, query for query.
Fair'by.
cog y'ain't come t'learn stitchin' or milking or herding.
why you here?
I needing a guide.
guide? To what?
Mauna Sol.
bridge a'broken, hide below.
what's wrong?
we cross and recross our old tracks like figure skaters...
and just as I was reading a new submission...
a powerful deja-vu ran through my bones.
I had been here before, another lifetime ago.
Ursula...
the love of my life?
I could think of no other serious applicants.
what had happened to her?
and more importantly, what had happened to the young man...
who had ridden this same train composing sonnets to his "Soul Bound Love"?
the auguring come true, Abbess. Broke bridge just like you say.
Meronym were there yibbering about trekking up Mauna Sol...
horses' pass'n, woman come cussing n'twisting up my life
mind the Words o'Sonmi.
our lives are not our own.
from womb to tomb, we are bound to others...
past and present...
and by each crime...
and every kindness...
we birth our future.
welcome to Neo Seoul.
come on, out you come.
this may be the biggest mistake of my life, but here.
thank you, Mr. Ewing. Thank you.
now to tell the truth, I was worried...
you might try and eat me if you didn't get something in that stomach.
well, you safe, Mr. Ewing. I no like white meat.
Ha-ha-ha. - Oh. Right.
but before I decide what I am going to do with you...
tell me why you were being whipped so savagely.
my uncle was a sailor.
he took me on a French whaler when I was 10 years old.
I seen too much of the world.
I no good slave.
why did you look at me?
pain strong, aye? But friend's eye more strong.
look, you are a runaway slave and I am a lawyer.
how do you imagine we could possibly be friends?
all you need.
Jesus! Javier Gomez, what did I tell you about jumping onto my balcony?
why do you leave the door open if you don't want me to come in?
because, smarty-pants, the only thing worse than having you jump onto my balcony...
is the idea of you jumping onto my balcony and being stuck out there.
okay.
what are you reading?
just old letters.
sixsmith...
the plot has taken a sensual turn.
last week, Jocasta and I became lovers.
but don't alarm yourself. It is only a carnal act performed in service.
not unlike my role as amanuensis.
and I confess, women's hearts, like their desire, remain a mystery to me.
afterward she cried and thanked me for bringing life back into their home...
making it clear that Vyvyan had been there the entire night...
between us like the silence between notes that holds the key to all music.
P. S. Best news of all:
I've started my own work.
uh, I called about an old recording...
written by a man named Robert Frobisher.
Oops. Uh, busted.
I know I shouldn't be playing it.
I was checking it to make sure it wasn't scratched.
but, honestly, I just can't stop listening to it.
this is the "Cloud Atlas Sextet"?
it's the "Symphony."
it's beautiful.
but I think I heard this before.
I can't imagine how.
I doubt there's more than a handful of copies in all of North America.
but I know it.
I know I know it.
before I realized it, my feet had borne me back...
to the Temple of Sacrifice where I offered up my virginity.
back to those four days of paradise...
when Ursula's mater and pater slipped off to Greece for a long weekend.
or so we thought.
Ursula! - Oh!
sir, madam! I assure you this is completely innocent!
two sprained ankles, one cracked rib.
official cause of accident listed on the hospital form, "pussy."
what were the chances that she still lived in this house?
and yet, there she was.
Ursula.
why had I never returned her calls or letters?
shame. Spinelessness. Hallmarks of the Cavendish clan.
I realized I had a choice.
I could slink off and continue as planned...
or I could go boldly to the door and discover what hope, if any, lay within.
Abbess, come quick. It's the Bailey girl. - Catkin?
Aye. She dying.
what happened? - Zach!
Sonmi... - The scorpion fish.
healer say she be gone by sundown.
ain't right, ain't fair but nothing to be done.
be very still.
termination charge, here.
just enough to blow carotid.
how does it feel?
good.
Catkin's dying!
what? - Trod on a scorpion fish.
you can save her. You got spesh smarts in that gearbag what'll save her.
that's the True-true.
prescient Council swear by special order...
say I can't go play Lady Sonmi for every fate twistin' wrong...
N' click fingers make right.
I just a stupid goat herder, but I cog you killin' Catkin by not acting...
just as if I left you up on that bridge, you Kona meat.
if a Prescient be laying with poison melting her heart'n'lungs...
if it be your kin?
Why's a Prescient's life worth more'n a Valleysman?
I'll take you to Mauna Sol.
I know the way.
if you save Catkin...
I will guide you through the devil's door if that's where you want to go.
while the past may call to us with the enchantment of a siren...
better, I believed, to stay the course set by dear brother Denny.
just sign right here.
and tomorrow, life could begin afresh, afresh, afresh.
this way.
come on. Come.

it's not what you are used to, but I think you will like it.
this is your bed.
these are your clothes.
mine? But these are Pureblood clothes.
no. They are yours.
did you know he was Union?
no, but it wouldn't have mattered.
why not?
because it was the first time a Pureblood had shown me kindness.

Oh, baby.

what the ruddy hell are you doing in my room?
keys go walkies! Let's give these to Ms. Judd for safekeeping, shall we?
leave my things alone, you pilfering cow!
because you're new, I shall not make you eat soap powder, this time.
be warned, I do not stand for offensive language in Aurora House.
not from anyone. And I never make idle threats, Mr. Cavendish. Never.
I'll talk to you how I ruddy well like, you thief!
make me eat soap powder? I'd like to see you try!
Ooh! Gawd! Bloody hell!
a disappointing start.
I am so sorry to keep you waiting. Uh, I know it's a Ms...?
Rey.
Luisa Rey. Spyglass Magazine.
right. Right.
Luisa, this is Joe Napier, he's our security chief.
um, I was surprised to get your query.
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a feisty magazine, but, uh...
anything you need, sir, just let me know. - Will do.
guys, I'm good. Thank you very much. - Thank you. See you.
our editor's trying to spice things up a little bit.
he says the public wants more substance, so...
Oh. Probably just a fad.
come on, follow me. Let's start you with the Chicken Ranch.
that is where we keep the Eggheads.
say hello to Nemo? Okay. Come on.
Hello, Mr. Cavendish.
feeling super this morning?
no.
I checked in last night believing that Aurora House was a hotel.
my brother made the booking, you see. His idea of a practical joke.
but listen, you have a bigger problem closer to home.
there's some demented bitch calling herself Noakes...
rampaging about the place, impersonating a chambermaid.
but the point is this:
she struck me and she stole my keys.
right? I'll need those keys back, straight away.
aurora House is your home now, Mr. Cavendish.
your signature authorizes us to apply...
signature?
the custody document you signed last night.
your residency papers.
no, no, no, no! That was the hotel register!
never mind, it's all academic. Oh.
this is gonna make a heck of a dinner-party story.
most of our guests get cold feet on their first mornings.
my keys, please.
residents are not...
I'm not a ruddy resident!
you'll find temper tantrums won't help you at Aurora House!
you're breaking the ruddy...
uh, Anti-Incarceration Act or some ruddy thing...
and I will not be subjected to criminal abuse!
I will not be subjected to criminal abuse.
outside, fat snowflakes...

you bet I am! To the land of the living.
Soylent Green is people!
Soylent Green is made of people!
Ha-ha-ha. - Oi! Get back here, you!
Oi!
you keep away from me or I'll be forced to name you in the police report as an accomplice!
I have better things to do than this!
then go ahead and do them, you bloody sodding soap-dodger!
right!
let go of me, you ruddy cruddy rugger bugger yob!
put me down!
you can maintain power over people as long as you give them something.
rob a man of everything and that man will no longer be in your power.

Fabricants can be excised for this.
our survival often demands our courage.
knowledge is a mirror...
and for the first time in my life, I was allowed to see who I was...
and who I might become.
go clean the head.
good morning, Captain.
you would help it remain so, Quillcock, by buggering off.
I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.
if I was, I would be unable to inform you of the stowaway...
that I have discovered in my cabin. - Stowaway?!
I assure you that this Moriori had no choice.
now, he has sworn to me that he is a first class, able-bodied seaman...
capable of earning passage, if only given a chance.
a stowaway is a stowaway even if he shits silver nuggets.
did he ever explain anything to you?
he told me their goal was the creation of a free-willed Fabricant.
Yoona had failed.
I was their last hope.
I have to say, if all lady journalists looked like you...
I might start to take this women's lib thing more seriously.
well, I'm sure they can use your support.
nice.
okay, you wait here and I will go and find someone smarter...
who can walk you through the details of some of your questions.
great.
okay, what would Dad do?
who the bloody hell is this? Have you any idea what time it is?
Denny? It's me, Tim.
Timothy?
where are you?
I think you ruddy well know where I am!
but residents aren't allowed access to phones.

you know the rules?
I helped write them, Timmy.
I have been a principal investor in Aurora House for 12 years.
it's incredibly lucrative. You can't believe what people will pay to lock up their parents.
look, Den. You've had your fun.
I think it's high time you put an end to this little game of yours.
ha, Ha. No, No, Timmy. My fun has just begun.
what are you talking about?
I'm your brother. Why are you doing this to me?
I think a better question in this instance would be:
what have you done to deserve this?
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, come now, dear brother, don't insult me.
you can't think that I didn't know about you and Georgette!
Georgette?
look, Den, I didn't mean to hurt you.
I'm afraid your penance has come due, Timbo. It's time to account for your crimes.
Denholme...
I'm... I'm so, so sorry.
no, No, No. There's no need to apologize.
your exile is more than enough reparation.
although, Ha, Ha, I do have my fingers crossed for a scenario involving you...
cheerio, Timmy. Bye-Bye now.
sends his love.
I would like to ask about the night of your arrest.
I remember listening to his heart beat.
your heart beats much slower than ours.
there is a gentleness to the sound.
I find it comforting.
Vyvyan, what time is it?
I don't know. Who cares?
I've heard a melody, boy. For violin.
quick.
find a pen!
I heard it in a dream.
I was in a nightmarish cafe...
blaring, bright light...
but underground, and no way out.
and the waitresses...
they all had the same face.
there was music playing, but unlike any music I've ever heard in my life.
it began...
it began...
wait.
it was so clear a minute ago.
help me, Robert! Help me! It's slipping away.
I've lost it.
it'll come to you, sir.
the minute you stop trying to find it, it'll find you.
you are naive, Robert.
I am anything but.
there is a gulf between these chairs.
what you want is no different from what I want.
the gulf is an illusion.
how do I describe that night, Sixsmith?
what had happened between Vyvyan and I transcended language.
it was music that poured from his eyes, that breathed from his lips.
music as beautiful as any I have ever heard.
what are you doing in here?
they found us.
I'll be with you the whole way. Now focus on me.
Hae-Joo!
stay with me.
right here. I won't let you go.
Mr. Ewing! - It's all right.
I've talked to the captain. He'll hear your case.
what's your name, boy?
Autua, sir.
this Christian gentleman, who knows nothing about ships...
tells me that you're a first-class sailor.
very well.
let's see you lower the main topsail.
Mr. Roderick, my bottle is empty.
Mr. Boerhaave, ready my piece.
what? Sir, you gave me your word, captain.
please. You can't do this!
nobody tells me what I can and cannot do on my own ship...
especially when it concerns nigger stowaways.
get them!
Cap'n, look!
he's got fish-hooks for toes.
Mr. Boerhaave, do not make a mess of my deck.
No!
Hae-Joo!
captain, please.
look, if you could just hear me out, please.
look!
Ha-ha-ha. The darkie's salt as I am!
Mr. Boerhaave?
it appears we have an addition to our crew. Be sure he earns his keep.
Mr. Hooks!
found her.
she was in the chem labs looking for the bathroom.
Ah.
well, perfect. Then why don't you take over from here, Sachs?
you know, introduce our little tribe...
and guide Ms. Rey through the, uh... through the tower.
funny thing is, I'm not even supposed to be here.
I was meant to be in Seoul...
but the air-traffic-controller strike screwed everything up...
so now I'm on the pond-jumper tonight.
you ever think the universe was against you?
all the time. - Mm.
you mind?
I'm cool.
you seem nervous, Isaac.
do I make you nervous? - No.
actually, just the opposite.
are you gonna tell me why you covered for me?
"freedom," the fatuous jingle of our civilization.
but only those deprived of it have the barest inkling of what it really is.
there's much disagreement on what should be done with you.
the Corprocrats want you euthanized as a deviant.
the Manufacturer is demanding a period of study.
the psychogenomicists are screaming for an immediate cerebral vivisection.
however, the problem you create is a political one...
which means you're my problem.
I find it intriguing to imagine that...
beneath these perfectly engineered features...
are thoughts that terrify the whole of Unanimity.
I'm not afraid of such thoughts because I do not fear the truth.
there's a natural order to this world, Fabricant...
and the truth is, this order must be protected.
inform the Archivist and prepare her for Excitement.
Yes, sir. - Sir?
can you tell me what happened to Hae-Joo Chang?
killed, I was told.
all these recent excitements, really, Adam, it's far too much.
you need to rest.
I had a girlfriend once.
she kept trying to get me to read Carlos Castaneda.
you ever read any of that shit?
Oh, yeah.
but the relationship was doomed.
every time she brought up any of that karma, past life stuff...
I couldn't stop myself from laughing.
and yet...
I can't explain it...
but I knew when I opened that door...
they destroyed most of the copies of the report.
most?
there's no good choice here, is there?
if I help you, I could lose my job...
or worse.
if I don't, a lot of people...
Yeah, it'll be worse than worse.
you have to do whatever you can't not do.
something praying on you, Zachry?
you really ain't feary 'bout meetin' Old Georgie on the summit?
more scaresome about the weather than any devil.
you cog he's real?
who tripped the Fall, if not Old Georgie?
True-true?
the Old Uns.
that's jus' a rope o' smoke.
old Uns got the Smart.
they mastered sick and seeds...
mak'd mir'cles 'n fly 'cross the sky.
true. All true. But they got something else.
a hunger'n their hearts, hunger that's stronger'n all their Smart.
hunger? For what?
a hunger for more.
belief, like fear or love, is a force to be understood...
as we understand the Theory of Relativity...
and Principles of Uncertainty...
phenomena that determine the course of our lives.
yesterday, my life was headed in one direction.
today, it is headed in another.
yesterday, I believed I would never have done what I did today.
these forces that often remake time and space...
that can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be...
begin long before we are born and continue after we perish.
our lives and our choices...
like quantum trajectories...
are understood moment to moment.
at each point of intersection...
each encounter...
suggests a new potential direction.
I have fallen in love with Luisa Rey.
is this possible?
I just met her, and yet...
I feel like something important has happened to me.
that's it.
the music from my dream.
this is from my dream. That night I came to your room...
this is the music I heard in my head.
somehow I gave it to you.
I've been working on this piece for weeks now...
and I suspect you heard it and incorporated it into your dream.
I call it the "Cloud Atlas Sextet."
this is obviously the result of our collaboration.
the "Atlas," I believe...
is the only thing I have done in my life that has value.
yet I know I could not have written it...
if I hadn't met you.
there are whole movements in the "Atlas" that I wrote imagining us...
meeting again and again in different lives, in different ages.
Yes.
something as important as this cannot be described as yours...
or mine.
it is ours.
that is exactly how I feel, Vyvyan.
I'm sorry, I...
I thought...
you thought? You thought what?
that I might fancy a little buggering from a fine young dandy like yourself?
I'll pack my bags and be gone by morning.
you'll do no such thing. You'll leave only when I say you can leave.
you will continue working on Vyvyan Ayrs' "Cloud Atlas."
when it is finished, then I will decide what to do with you.
you can't keep me here! I'm leaving.
good luck with your composing.
I'm sure a sterile old fuck like yourself...
is still capable of something completely inmemorable.
I suggest you think about this, Robert.
think about reputation.
reputation is everything in our society.
yours, my disinherited reprobate, has expired.
did you not think that we would inquire about someone living under our roof?
Mackerras himself wrote, and I quote:
he is a prostitute...
whose liaisons with perverts and sodomites were commonplace...
in his brief and forgettable career at Caius.
"lock up the silverware." Unquote.
be warned:
leave here without my consent and all the musical society will know...
of the degenerate Robert Frobisher.
after that...
even if you compose one of the greatest symphonies ever written...
no one will hear it...
because no one will want anything to do with you.
I won't let you go again.
I told you he'd come.
two things became clear.
hanging myself from Edinburgh's flagpole was preferable...
to letting that parasite plunder my talents a day longer.
I must complete my sextet.
I can't do it here, so tonight I plan to make my escape.
please stand by for vehicle scan.
clearance granted.
any jailbreak's a risky proposition.
I know, I know.
we could use code names, but truth is, I'd probably be the first to forget mine.
so, Mr. Cavendish, Ernie Blacksmith.
this is Mr. Meeks, and my girl, Veronica Costello.
to trust.
to trust.
I know, I know.
what about the parrot, then? If ever there was a likely songbird.
Mr. Meeks is a fine and honorable gentleman.
he would never betray us.
besides, no one's ever heard him say anything else.
I know, I know.
question is, old man, think you're up to snuff?
unanimity requires compliance. We have a security code red.
prepare to be boarded.
what are we going to do?
stay calm, stay calm.
"it will end in tears." You warned me.
I suppose I'm as hopeless as Adam Ewing, oblivious to all the unspeakable forms lying in wait, blind to the fact his friend is poisoning him.
Henry, please.
the idea of losing this ring distresses me beyond measure.
don't be a silly puffin, Adam. I'm sure your wife would set your health above a gold loop.
I have seen the onset for dropsy and it is not a pretty sight.
I know an excellent Spanish goldsmith who works with such alacrity that your Tilda may not have to know this was ever removed.
give it to me!
get your fucking hands off my pudding!
it's not your pudding, you Alzheimer's lout!
you've already eaten your pudding!
stop it!
don't you talk to me like that!
I'll speak to you any way I... - You better get in here.
it doesn't mean you can have two puddings just because you've already...
stop it now!
you ruddy idiot!
you think you can get away with that?
stop it!
I said, stop it!
Mr. Cavendish!
the room stank of bitter medicine.
curiously heavy things, guns.
why did I take it exactly?
can't say.
an intuition, a sense of significance, that from this point on, there was no going back.
okay.
Sussin' them clouds, we run out time.
Hey, don't need no smart rope.
yea.
see you fall, I catch you.
hands in the air!
step off the vehicle. - Get down!
get down! Now!
fucking migrant monkey-talk.
it's okay.
why do they hire these greasy subs?
negative, sir. Definite illegal.
detain him for now.
I'm reading a second life form! - Where?
in the truck. - Check it out.
Yes, sir.
you trod on the Devil's ground now, Valleysman.
I'm saying just once. That offlander ain't getting to the top.
time for you to let go of that rope.
you trespass, you pay the price.
now drop that rope.
drop that rope!
drop that rope!
ForceCon One entering the truck.
Roger that.
maintaining visual.
it's her! - Everything okay, huh?
What?!
Freeze!
I. M.E, I. M.E!
who are you?
commander Hae-Joo Chang.
first Science Officer of the Union Rebellion.
why are you doing this?
because I believe you have the power to change this world.
now drop that rope.
let go of that rope! Let go of that rope!
hands are bleeding, can't let go. - Let go.
hands are bleeding - Can't let go. - don't let go. No.
thank you, Zachry.
you saving me twice now.
you fall, I'll catch you.
excessive force confirmed.
stop them. Stop them now!
what are you doing, boy?
I thought I'd made myself clear.
do what you want. I'm leaving.
fine, Frobisher. Go.
but I'll take this.
give that to me! - It's mine!
I'm warning you.
under the conditions of this relationship,
I'm certainly within my legal rights.
give it to me! Give it to me or, I swear to God, I will kill you as you stand!
please.
you're a coward.
I'll do it. - You won't pull that trigger.
your kind never does.
Yes. Yes, well...
how fares our worm today, Adam?
I'm afraid it has taken the best of me.
Oh, No, No, No. Nonsense. Nonsense.
you mustn't give up.
you must think of your beautiful wife.
you must think of Tilda.
they're trapped in the dam way. We've got them.
come on.
what are you doing?
come on, come on. Hurry!
nay, the dead never stay dead.
open your ears and they never stop a'yibbering.
what is this place?
before the Fall, Old Uns built dwellings beyond the sky, among the stars, and this place joined here with there.
Sonmi...
tis she.
the Old Uns prayed to Sonmi same as Valleysmen?
nay, not 'cisely same.
move it! Move it. Step aside.
over here. This way.
get out of my way!
come on.
now, stay close. Fabricants get snatched here.
all clear.
thank you.
no sweat. We're partners. But you gotta tell me what's happening.
let me take off these clothes, call the cops, and I promise I'll tell you everything that happened in the morning.
okay, but I hope you realize you just said exactly what every character in any decent mystery says right before they get killed.
good night, Javier.
What'd you mean down there, 'bout the Old Uns and Valleysmen praying to Sonmi, not 'cisely the same?
I mean, they were different.
different.
how?
you want the True-true?
this is where you live?
this is where Union was born.
Sonmi weren't no god.
she died hundreds of years ago on a faraway peninsula deadlanded now.
what?
I cog Valleysman beliefs.
I know Abbess taught you Sonmi was a miracle, birthed o' Darwin God o' Smart, but ain't the True-true.
lies.
her life was sad and judased.
she died trying to change the Old-Uns thinking.
lies, nothing but lies.
nay, nay, you're lying.
the nature of our immortal lives is in the consequences of our words...
Sonmi?
fore she died, she spoke of her acts 'n' deeds.
her words a heart sake blessing minder me what's the True-true.
how long you listen to this?!
how long you just stand there and let a stranger keep fucking your beliefs up and down, and in and out?!
our lives are not our own.
from womb to tomb, we are bound to others.
Zachry.
you all right?
finish your sussing.
shh, shh! Shh!
if I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.
now, I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
be cool, all right?
and if I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already.
how's that feel, huh?
good conversation starter, isn't it?
you knew my father?
korean War.
I was in the 21.
that's me on the end, next to your dad.
the mortar landed so close it could've dropped out of my ass.
if your father hadn't done what he did, I wouldn't be here.
guess that makes two of us.
Oh, yeah, you ain't let go that rope cause you are lusting for that darkly, sweet meat.
Ah, cog it all now.
for what, fool?
they want the island.
Prescients want it all.
she ain't your tribe! She ain't even your color!
this Jezebel ignores your yarns and ways, spinning and spouting her whoahsome lies, and you lap it up like a dog in heat!
it ain't true.
ain't it? Then do somthing, stop her!
take your spiker and slit her throat.
protect your tribe! Protect your sis and little Catkin!
kill her now 'fore it's too late!
they will kill you.
you don't know these people like I do.
yeah? Well, if that's all you came to tell me, you're a little bit late.
somebody just forced me off the Swannekkee bridge.
this is out of control.
you know who did it?
a contractor. Calls himself Bill Smoke.
and... Hm.
what?
he got Sachs.
Isaac? - A bomb on his plane.
the press is blaming the PLO.
he was a threat, like Sixsmith. Like... you.
they all need to get in here, so pass behind.
bring them through.
Sonmi-451.
I am most honored to meet you.
I am General An-Kor Apis, leader of Union.
who's paying him?
the same guy that pays me.
Lloyd Hooks?
he was in Pikes Consulting.
Yeah, I heard of them.
they were, uh, lobbyists for oil companies.
but...
why would Big Oil hire Lloyd Hooks to run a nuclear reactor?
you got that same look your father used to get.
you see it, don't you?
hooks doesn't want the report discovered because he doesn't want the reactor fixed.
he wants it to fail.
this is about the future of energy in this country.
they want the explosion, the chaos and carnage.
the more deaths, the better.
can't cog it.
words and worries like a wasp's nest poke'd and prod'd by you!
you come elbowing in my life, yibberin' about the True-true...
an' never telling the whole true.
I need to cog what you're doing!
I told you. I come to send a plea o'help.
help, why?
to steal our land?
to kill and slave us all? What you want?!
Prescients dyin', Zachry. Jus' like Catkin.
this world poisoned me and all my kin.
we get no help, find no home off land away.
I sayso truesome, we not s'vive.
we not s'vive.
Ayrs has the dogs after me.
the bullet passed through, killing little more than his appetite...
yet he's out for blood.
will have to pay the piper.
I should call the cops.
won't help.
how do I know you're not lying to me?
Smoke'll be coming for me as soon as he figures out I'm with you.
we need that report. I can't protect you for long without it.
general Apis...
you, my dear...
are proof our efforts were not in vain.
but I'm just a diner server.
I was not genomed to alter reality.
no revolutionary ever was.
I'm sorry.
I cannot do what you're asking.
hm.
it would be a difficult choice for anyone.
but before you call your decision final...
there is one last thing I would like you to see...
in order to fully understand what we are fighting for.
cross your fingers and toes.
if your prayer be answered...
will Prescients never return to the Valley again?
those wishin' to come with us be welcome.
the Valley is my home.
are you all right?
I know it is forbidden.
Sixsmith, I climb the steps of the Scott Monument every morning...
and all becomes clear.
wish I could make you see this brightness.
don't worry, all is well.
all is so perfectly, damnably well!
I understand now...
that boundaries between noise and sound are conventions.
all boundaries are conventions...
waiting to be transcended.
one may transcend any convention if only one can first conceive of doing so.
at moments like this...
I can feel your heart beating as clearly as I feel my own...
and I know that separation is an illusion.
my life extends far beyond the limitations of me.
all hands!
storm is coming, Mr. Ewing. Got to get you down below.
yes? Okay.
I'm not running a fucking charity. Out with you!
on you go!
Oh, Mr. Ewing.
uh... oh. A word, if I may?
dangerous times we live in, eh?
quite a scandal.
they say this ruffian, Robert Frobisher, is a composer.
you're a composer too, aren't you, Mr. Ewing?
what do you want?
the constable asked to search my rooms.
I know how hard you're working, so I told him...
there's no one on the third floor.
it costs quite a bit of money to keep an entire floor empty.
that's all I have. - Oh.
Mm.
what a beautiful waistcoat.
if these letters aren't important, why do you keep reading them?
I don't know.
maybe I'm just trying to understand something.
what?
why we keep making the same mistakes over and over.
maybe you should ask...
Megan.
what?
do you know a Megan?
that's his niece.
how do you know that?
looks like he mailed something to her.
probably used the envelope he was keeping the letters in.
come on, Luisa.
first rule of mystery writing: A good clue always leads to another clue.
when The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish is turned into a film...
I'm thinking for the role of the hero one part Sir Laurence Olivier...
with a dash of Michael Caine.
who the hell is this?
Dr. Conway, Aurora House. I'm covering for Dr. Upward.
Oh, is this about Mother?
Yes, it is, Mr. Hotchkiss. I'm afraid you must steel yourself.
I don't think she's going to last the night.
unfortunately, it isn't a convenient time for us.
do we really need to come right now?
uh, no, of course not, but she did ask for you specifically...
and she seems quite upset about her last will.
we'll be right there.
in mizzen up mainsail!
the plan was a series of toppling dominoes...
that had commenced with Ernie announcing my death to Nurse Noakes.
I know, I know!
Shh...
the entire ambush hinged upon the silence of Mr. Meeks.
I know, I know. - Shh.
Mr. Cavendish?
everything all right?
don't leave me here. - Shh.
Mr. Cavendish?
you!
I knew it was too good to be true!
you cantankerous witch!
Mr. Hotchkiss, your mother is my dearest friend here. Do please hurry.
and so, adieu!
which, translated literally from the French, means "to commend before God"!
Oh.
I have Joe Napier on line one, Mr. Hooks. He said he can't wait.
for God's sake, Joe, I am late already. What's up?
I got a call from that reporter... Rey.
she was asking about Sixsmith.
I see. - You said she wasn't gonna be a problem.
uh, well, some problems are more resilient than others, Joe.
Where's the ruddy key?
did he not leave it in the ignition?
his wife was driving! She took it!
the ruddy female took the key in with her!
sweet Saint Ruddy Jude, what do we do now?
look under the sun flap!
Yes!
what is it? It's not a key. What do you do with it?
what else could it be? - Well, how does it work?!
shite! - Oh, no!
well, think of something! You're the genius! You're the ruddy ruddy genius!
we're done for.
Oh, boy. I can't even believe I agreed to do this.
is this thing working? I mean, is it even on? Can you hear me?
just keep walking.
I think he's behind me.
whatever you do, don't look back.
get out of my car or I'll sue!
I'm gonna flay your arse straight into a coma if you don't open this door!
you! Out!
get out of my bloody car! - Cavendish!
get out of there, Cavendish! - What's that button for?
Yes!
Yes! - Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, no.
it's Mr. Meeks. He does want to come.
Oh, dear.
Oh, ruddy bloody hell.
all for one and one for all?
the gate!
Veronica, would you unlock the door for Mr. Meeks?
Hello, Mr. Meeks. We're out for a nighttime drive.
I know! I know!
ramming speed! - Aah!
how thrilling!
Oh, no!
foot to the floor, Cavendish! - Here we go!
Aah!
here we go.
come on now, Adam, handsomely does it.
Oh, the worm fights back.
it is always darkest before the dawn.
Mr. Ewing is at a critical juncture in his treatment.
the next few hours will determine if he lives or dies.
then I stay here.
no... you can't.
I must.
Mr. Ewing save my life. He my duty.
listen to me, you ignorant ape.
Mr. Ewing doesn't want you around him. You probably infected him to begin with!
he begged me, and I quote, "Keep that dirty nigger away from me.
so, please, kindly respect his wishes!
Where'd he go?
I don't know.
Oh, shit. - What...?
to freedom!
freedom! Ha-ha-ha.
Oh...
Oh!
fuck! - Bullshit!
that's it. England does it again.
scotland goes down in flames. Oh, the embarrassment!
you are going to be sorry in ways you cannot even imagine.
fuckin' English bastards!
help!
fuck! - Joe!
no illegals here! No illegals here! Boss away! Boss away!
look, I'm not an inspector. We need your help.
I don't understand.
are there no true Scotsmen in the house?
those there English gerunts...
are trampling all over my God-given rights!
these people are mine.
they've used me and my pals most direly...
and we're in need of a wee bit of assistance!
aye, pal.
we'll not let you down.
now you just look here, you grebo.
two people came in here. Which way did they go?
we treat workers good!
no need union!
which way did they go? - Aah!
shut up! - My boss has many friends.
shut the fuck up!
don't make a mistake! Aah!
stupid fucking wetback.
what... what was that, Adam?
how shall I comprehend when you drool and dribble so?
Oh, let me hazard a guess.
something in the key of, "Oh, Henry, how could you do this to me?"
I thought we were friends.
well, unfortunately, you were wrong.
wrong.
like Horrox and your silly father-in-law.
there is only one rule that binds all people...
one governing principle that defines every relationship on God's green earth.
the weak are meat and the strong do eat.
that way.
I told Hooks you couldn't be trusted, Joe.
you'll be next, you son of a bitch.
part of the business.
enjoy your retirement.
and don't call me a fucking wetback.
stand by to take in foresail! - Stand by to take in...
why, you ask?
it's absurdly simple.
there is gold in your trunk. I want it...
so I have killed you for it.
get away from Mr. Ewing or I kill you.
you!
Mr. Ewing, Mr. Ewing!
got to flush you out.
come on, Mr. Ewing, come on!
die!
die!
what was that?
kona war cry.
Zachry!
Oh, no, no, Sonmi, no!
Zachryl!
this is what the general wanted me to see?
the end rushes towards me.
unable to eat or sleep.
like Ewing, the mortal coil has become a noose.
would rather become music.
they believe they are going to Xultation...
but they are not, are they?
welcome.
take a seat.
just relax.
this is to remove your collar.
nay.
no.
nay.
rose.
rose.
enemy's sleeping, don't slit that throat.
their genomics industry demands a huge quantity of bio matter for womb tanks.
but more importantly, to sustain their engineered labor force.
recycled Fabricants are a cheap source of protein.
soap.
they feed us to ourselves.
that ship...
that ship must be destroyed.
Yes.
the systems that built them must be torn down.
Yes.
no matter if we are born in a tank or a womb, we are all Pureblood.
Yes.
we must all fight...
and, if necessary, die...
to teach people the truth.
this is what we have been waiting for.
it's done.
Oh. Oh. Here, here, Catkin.
Oh. Oh, Catkin. Oh.
no.
you were then taken to a Union-controlled satellite link.
I broadcast my Revelation...
to the Twelve States and Four Off-World Colonies.
eighteen minutes later, the Enforcers attacked.
to be is to be perceived.
and so to know thyself is only possible through the eyes of the other.
the nature of our immortal lives is in the consequences of our words...
and deeds that go on apportioning themselves...
throughout all time.
Zachry.
uncle Zach!
hide, hide!
Zachry!
No! No! No!
you kill chief. Now you meat.
catkin.
safe now. - Unc'a Zach!
safe, safe now.
thank Sonmi.
no, thank you.
come on, Mr. Ewing, one more.
one more.
salt clean out your stomach.
good, good.
come on, Mr. Ewing, come on. Come on.
see where we are? See where we are? Stay here.
home.
home.
Megan Sixsmith?
make them pay.
you can count on it.
thank you.
my uncle was a scientist, but he believed that love was real...
a kind of natural phenomenon.
he believed that...
love could outlive death.
finished in a frenzy that reminded me of our last night in Cambridge.
watched my final sunrise, enjoyed a last cigarette.
didn't think the view could be any more perfect...
until I saw that beat-up trilby.
honestly, Sixsmith, as ridiculous as that thing makes you look...
I don't believe I've ever seen anything more beautiful.
watched you for as long as I dared.
I don't believe it was a fluke that I saw you first.
okay. - Thank you.
corporal, update the log book...
and make sure there is a cabin... - Captain say-soed take you with us.
I wanna go with Meronym.
go where?
Prescients n'same boat as us.
got no home neitherwise.
Nay... not yet.
you think someone going to hear your prayer, come down from the sky?
P'haps. P'haps one day.
Heh. One day ain't but a flea o' hope.
yay, and fleas ain't so easy to rid.
hm.
I believe there is another world waiting for us, Sixsmith.
a better world...
and I'll be waiting for you there.
may I help you, sir?
Yes, thank you, I'm looking for a friend who came to Edinburgh.
I believe we do not stay dead long.
find me beneath the Corsican stars where we first kissed.
yours eternally, R. F.
No!
God!
No!
the report said Commander Chang was killed in the assault.
that is correct.
would you say that you loved him?
Yes, I do.
do you mean you are still in love with him?
I mean that I will always be.
our lives are not our own.
from womb to tomb...
we are bound to others...
past and present...
and by each crime and every kindness...
we birth our future.
in your Revelation, you spoke of the consequences of an individual's life...
rippling throughout eternity.
does this mean that you believe in an afterlife?
in a heaven or a hell?
I believe death is only a door.
when it closes, another opens.
if I cared to imagine a heaven...
I would imagine a door opening...
and behind it...
I would find him there...
waiting for me.
Oh! - Oh, Tilda!
I'm home. I'm home.
I'm home.
Oh, God, I missed you so much!
thank you, sir.
if I may ask one last question:
you had to know this Union scheme was doomed to fail.
Yes.
then why did you agree to it?
this is what General Apis asked of me.
what, to be executed?
if I had remained invisible, the truth would stay hidden.
I couldn't allow that.
and what if no one believes this truth?
someone already does.
Adam? Good God!
I have just been recounting your astonishing adventure.
please join us.
get him a chair.
no, no, thank you. I cannot stay.
well, what are you doing here?
I thought the doctor said at least three weeks in bed.
he did, but this couldn't wait.
I need to speak with you, sir. Privately.
of course.
excuse me.
is that the contract from Reverend Horrox?
it is indeed.
well, you know, I could have sent a boy.
are you insane?!
I owe my life to a self-freed slave.
and I cannot in good conscience participate in this kind of business any longer.
this would make such a good book.
I'll drink to that.
outside, fat snowflakes are falling on slate roofs and granite walls.
like Solzhenitsyn laboring in Vermont, I shall beaver away in exile.
unlike Solzhenitsyn, I shan't be alone.
goddamn you, sir. If you were not my daughter's husband...
Hello, Father.
tilda?
what is going on?
I've come to say goodbye.
goodbye? Where are you going?
we're moving back East to work with the Abolitionists.
what?
that poison has rotted your brain.
well, if it has, I highly recommend it.
I've not felt this good in years.
Tilda, I forbid you from going anywhere with this madman.
I've been afraid of you my whole life, Father.
I'm going with my husband.
Adam!
listen to me.
for the sake of my grandson, if not your own.
there is a natural order to this world...
and those who try to upend it do not fare well.
this movement will never survive.
if you join them, you and your entire family will be shunned.
at best, you'll exist as pariah to be spat on and beaten.
at worst, lynched or crucified.
and for what?
for what?
no matter what you do...
it will never amount to anything more than a single drop in a limitless ocean.
but what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?
well, firey dying.
Mm. Just as well. My yarning is done.
No! Please!
tell us one more!
come on in here, you little buggers! Come on, it's getting cold!
uh, now, you heard your Grammy. Go on. Get on with ya. Come on.
eh? Eh?
you like it out here, don'tcha, Grampy?
Supposin' it minders me of my Valley, huh?
which is Earth?
uh... There.
that one there. That blue shimmered.
Yeah.
now, help your Grampy up.
Oh, yeah.
are you gonna tell us about the woahsome ship...
and the big sleep and all the nex'nexs?
no, your grammy tells the nex'nexs way better than me.
do you still love Grammy?
your grammy is the best thing that ever happened to me.
Mm. - Come on here, Grammy.
Lemme warm them old bones.
who are you? We are three wise men.
what? We are three wise men.
well, what are you doing creeping around a cow shed at 2: 00 in the morning?
that doesn't sound very wise to me.
we are astrologers. We have come from the east.
is this some kind of joke?
we wish to praise the infant.
we must pay homage to him.
homage? You're drunk! It's disgusting!
out the door! Out! Bashing me with tales about Oriental fortunetellers.
come on, out! No, no. We must see him.
go and praise someone else's brat. We were led by a star.
led by a bottle, more like. Go on out.
we must see him. We have brought presents.
out! Gold, frankincense, myrrh.
well, why didn't you say? He's over there.
sorry the place is a bit of a mess.
well, what is myrrh anyway? It is a valuable balm.
a balm? What are you giving him a balm for? It might bite him.
what? That's a dangerous animal.
no, it isn't. Yes, it is.
it's great big and No, it is an ointment.
well, there is an animal called a balm... or did I dream it?
so you're astrologers, are you? Well, what is he, then?
hmm? What star sign is he?
well, Capricorn. Capricorn, eh? What are they like?
he is the Son of God, our Messiah.
king of the Jews!
that's Capricorn, is it? No, that's just him.
Oh, I was gonna say, otherwise there would be a lot of them.
by what name are you calling him? Uh, Brian.
we worship you, O Brian, who are lord over us all.
praise unto you, Brian, and to the Lord, our Father. Amen.
you do a lot of this, then? What?
this praising. No, no, no, no.
well, if you're dropping by again, do pop in.
and thanks a lot for the gold and frankincense.
but don't worry too much about the myrrh next time, all right?
thank you. Goodbye.
well, weren't they nice?
out of their bloody minds, but still... look at that!
here! Here!
that that's mine! Hey, he's a baby! Oh!
shut up!
Brian
the babe they called Brian
he grew
grew, grew and grew
grew up to be
grew up to be
a boy called Brian
a boy called Brian
he had arms and legs
and hands and feet
this boy
whose name was Brian
and he grew
grew, grew and grew
grew up to be
Yes, he grew up to be
a teenager called Brian
a teenager called Brian
and his face became spotty
Yes, his face became spotty
and his voice dropped down low
and things started to grow
on young Brian and show
he was certainly no
no girl named Brian
not a girl named Brian
and he started to shave
and have one off the wrist
and want to see girls
and go out and get pissed
a man called Brian
this man called Brian
the man they called Brian
this man called
bri
Aah!
how blessed are those who know that He's a god.
how blessed are the sorrowful. They shall find consolation.
how blessed are those of gentle spirit.
they shall have the earth for their possession.
how blessed are those who hunger and thirst to see right prevail.
they shall be satisfied.
how blessed are those whose hearts are pure.
they shall see God.
speak up! Shhh. Quiet, Mum.
well, I can't hear a thing. Let's go to the stoning.
Shhh! We can go to a stoning anytime.
Oh, come on, Brian. Will you be quiet?
don't pick your nose.
I wasn't picking my nose. I was scratching.
you was picking it while you was talking to that lady.
I wasn't. Leave it alone. Give it a rest.
do you mind? I can't hear a word he's saying.
don't you "do you mind" me! I was talking to my husband.
well, go and talk to him somewhere else. I can't hear a bloody thing.
don't you swear at my wife.
I was only asking her to shut up so we can hear what he's saying, Big Nose.
don't you call my husband "Big Nose." Well, he has got a big nose.
could you be quiet, please? What was that?
I was too busy talking to Big Nose.
I think it was, "Blessed are the cheese makers."
what's so special about the cheese makers?
well, obviously, it's not meant to be taken literally.
it refers to any manufacturers of dairy products.
see, if you hadn't been going on, we'd have heard that, Big Nose.
Hey! Say that once more, I'll smash your bloody face in.
better keep listening. Might be a bit about, "Blessed are the Big Noses."
Oh, lay off him.
Oh, you're not so bad yourself, Conch Face.
where are you two from, Nose City?
one more time, mate, I'll take you to fuckin' cleaners!
language! And don't pick your nose.
I wasn't gonna pick my nose. I was gonna thump him!
hear that? "Blessed are the Greek." The Greek?
well, apparently he's going to inherit the earth.
did anyone catch his name? You're not gonna thump anybody.
I'll thump him if he calls me "Big Nose" again.
Oh, shut up, Big Nose. Oh! Right. I warned you.
I really will slug you so hard oh, it's the meek!
"Blessed are the meek"! Oh, that's nice, isn't it?
I'm glad they're getting something, 'cause they have a hell of a time.
listen, I'm only telling the truth. You have got a very big nose.
Hey, your nose gonna be three foot wide across your face when I'm finished!
Shhh! Who hit yours, then? Goliath's big brother?
Oh. Right. That's your last warning.
Oh, do pipe down.
silly bitch. Get in the way on me.
Oh, come on. Let's go to the stoning.
all right.
blessed is just about anyone with a vested interest in the status quo.
well, what Jesus fails to appreciate is it's the meek who are the problem.
Yes, yes. Absolutely, Reg. Yes, I see.
Oh, come on, Brian. They're gonna stone him before we get there.
all right.
that's disgusting.
it's the chap with a big nose's fault. He started it all.
Oh, I hate wearing these beards.
why aren't women allowed to go to stonings, Mum?
it's written, that's why.
beard, madame?
Oh, look, I haven't got time to go to no stonings.
he's not well again.
stone, sir?
no, they got them up there, lying around on the ground.
Oh, not like these, sir. Look at this.
feel the quality of that. That's craftsmanship, sir.
well, all right. We'll have two with points and a big, flat one.
can I have a flat one, Mum? Shhh!
sorry. Dad. All right.
two points, two flats and a packet of gravel.
packet of gravel. Should be a good one this afternoon.
who? Local boy.
Oh, good. Enjoy yourselves.
Matthias, son of Deuteronomy of Gath?
do I say yes? Yes. Yes.
you have been found guilty by the elders of the town of uttering the name of our Lord.
and so as a blasphemer...
you are to be stoned to death.
look, I'd had a lovely supper, and all I said to my wife was, "That piece of halibut was good enough for Jehovah."
blasphemy! He said it again!
did you hear him?
really!
are there any women here today?
very well. By virtue of the authority vested in me
Ow! Lay off! We haven't started yet!
come on! Who threw that?
who threw that stone? Come on.
she did! She did!
he did! He did!
sorry. I thought we'd started.
go to the back.
always one, isn't there? Now, where were we?
look, I don't think it ought to be blasphemy, just saying "Jehovah."
you're only making it worse for yourself.
making it worse? How could it be worse?
Jehovah! Jehovah! Jehovah!
I'm warning you, if you say "Jehovah" once more
right. Who threw that?
come on. Who threw that?
him, him, him.
was it you? Yes.
right. Well, you did say "Jehovah."
stop! Will you stop that?
stop it! Now, look! No one is to stone anyone...
until I blow this whistle.
do you understand? Even and I want to make this absolutely clear
even if they do say "Jehovah.
good shot! Bravo!
have I got a big nose, Mum? Oh, stop thinking about sex.
I wasn't! You're always on about it, morning, noon and night.
will the girls like this? Will the girls like that?
is it too big? Is it too small?
here you are, mate.
bless you, sir. Alms for the poor.
alms for a leper. Alms for an exleper.
bloody donkey owners. All the same, ain't they?
never have any change. Oh, here's a touch.
spare a talent for an old exleper? Buzz off!
spare a talent for an old exleper?
a talent? That's more than he earns in a month!
half a talent, then. Now, go away!
come on, Big Nose, let's haggle. What?
you open at one shekel. I start at 2, 000. We close about 1, 800.
no. 1, 750?
go away! 1, 740?
leave him alone! All right, two shekels. Isn't this fun, eh?
look, he's not giving you any money, so piss off!
all right. Half a shekel for an old exleper? Did you say "exleper"?
sixteen years behind the bell, and proud of it, sir.
well, what happened? I were cured, sir.
cured? Yes, a bloody miracle, sir.
well, who cured you? Jesus did, sir.
I was hopping along, minding my own business.
all of a sudden, up he comes, cures me!
one minute, I'm a leper with a trade;
next minute, my livelihood's gone.
"you're cured, mate." Bloody dogooder.
well, why don't you go and tell him that you want to be a leper again?
I could do that, sir. Yeah, I could do that, I suppose.
I was gonna ask him if he'd make me a bit lame in one leg during the middle of the week.
you know, something beggable but not leprosy, which is a pain in the ass.
Brian! Come and clean your room out!
there you are. Thank you, sir. Thank
half a denary? Me bloody life story.
there's no pleasing some people.
that's just what Jesus said, sir.
Oh! Good afternoon.
Oh, uh, hello, officer.
I'll be with you in a few moments, all right, dear?
what's he doing here? Don't start that, Brian. Go and clean your room out.
bloody Romans! Now look, Brian.
if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have all this.
and don't you forget it. We don't owe the Romans anything, Mum.
well, that's not entirely true. What do you mean?
well, you know you were asking me about your My nose?
Yes. Well, there's a reason it's like it is, Brian.
what is it?
well, I suppose I should've told you a long time ago
what? Well, Brian...
your father isn't Mr. Cohen.
well, I never thought he was. None of your cheek!
he was a Roman, Brian.
he was a centurion in the Roman army.
you mean you were raped? Well, at first, yes.
who was it? Naughtius Maximus, his name was.
promised me the known world, he did.
I was to be taken to Rome, housed by the Forum slaves, asses' milk, as much gold as I could eat.
then he, having his way with me, he had
vroom, like a rat out of an aqueduct! The bastard!
Yeah, so next time you go on about the bloody Romans, don't forget you're one of 'em!
I'm not a Roman, Mum! And I never will be!
I'm a kike, a Yid, a hebe, a hooknose!
I'm kosher, Mum! I'm a Red Sea pedestrian, and proud of it!
sex, sex, sex. That's all they think about, huh?
well, how are you, then, officer?
ladies and gentlemen, the next contest is between Frank Goliath, the Macedonian babycrusher, and Boris Mineburg.
Larks' tongues. Wren's livers.
chaffinch brains. Jaguars' earlobes.
wolf's nipple chips. Get 'em while they're hot. They're lovely.
dromedary pretzels, only half a denar. Tuscany fried bats.
I do feel, Reg, that any antilmperialist group like ours...
must reflect such a divergence of interest within its power base.
Oh, great. Francis? Yeah, I think Judith's point of view is very valid, Reg, provided the movement never forgets...
that it is the inalienable right of every man or woman.
or woman to rid himself
or herself. Or herself
agreed. Thank you, brother.
or sister. Or sister.
where was I?
I think you finished. Oh, right.
furthermore, it is the birthright of every man
or woman. Why don't you shut up about women?
women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement.
why are you always on about women, Stan?
I want to be one.
what? I want to be a woman.
from now on, I want you all to call me "Loretta.
what? It's my right as a man.
well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?
I want to have babies.
you want to have babies?
it's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.
but you can't have babies. Don't you oppress me.
I'm not oppressing you. You haven't got a womb.
where is the fetus gonna gestate?
you're gonna keep it in a box?
here, I've got an idea.
suppose you agree that he can't actually have babies, not having a womb which is nobody's fault, not even the Romans'
but that he can have the right to have babies?
good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors...
for your right to have babies, brother
sister. Sorry. What's the point?
what? What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies...
when he can't have babies?
it is symbolic of our struggle against oppression.
symbolic of his struggle against reality.
it's dangerous out there.
Larks' tongues. Otters' noses. Ocelot spleens.
got any nuts? Haven't got any nuts. Sorry.
I've got wrens' livers, badger spleens. No, no, no.
otters' noses? I don't want that Roman rubbish!
why don't you sell proper food? Proper food?
Yeah, and not those rich, imperialist tidbits.
well, don't blame me. I didn't ask to sell this stuff.
all right. Bag of otters' noses, then.
make it two. Thanks, Reg. Two.
are you the Judean People's Front? Fuck off!
what? Judean People's Front!
we're the People's Front of Judea!
Judean People's Front! Wankers.
can I join your group? No. Piss off.
I didn't want to sell this stuff. It's only a job.
I hate the Romans as much as anybody! Shhh. Shhh!
are you sure? Oh, dead sure. I hate the Romans.
listen, if you wanted to join the P. F.J. you'd have to really hate the Romans.
I do. Oh, yeah? How much?
a lot.
right. You're in.
listen. The only people we hate more than the Romans...
are the fuckin' Judean People's Front.
Yeah! Splitters!
and the Judean Popular People's Front. Oh, yeah! Splitters!
and the People's Front of Judea. Splitters!
what? The People's Front of Judea.
we're the People's Front of Judea!
Oh. I thought we were the Popular Front.
people's Front!
what happened to the Popular Front? He's over there.
Splitter!
Oh! I think I'm about to have a cardiac arrest.
absolutely dreadful.
brother! Haha! What's your name?
Brian. Brian Cohen.
we may have a little job for you, Brian.
what's this, then? "Romanes eunt domus"?
"people called Romanes, they go the house"?
it says "Romans, go home."
no, it doesn't. What's Latin for "Roman"?
come on! "Romanes"?
goes like? "Annus"?
vocative plural of "annus" is? "Anni"?
Eunt"? What is "eunt"? "Go."
conjugate the verb to "go."
so "eunt" is?
third person plural, present indicative. "They go."
but "Romans, go home" is an order, so you must use the
the imperative. Which is?
um, oh, oh, "i."
how many Romans? Aah! Plural, plural.
"Domus"? Nominative?
"go home." This is motion towards, isn't it, Brian?
dative!
no, not dative!
accusative, accusative!
Domum," sir. "Ad domum." Except when "domus" takes the
locative, sir. Which is?
understand? Yes, sir.
now, write it out 100 times.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Hail Caesar, sir.
hail Caesar. If it's not done by sunrise, I'll cut your balls off.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you. Hail Caesar and everything, sir.
finished!
right. Now, don't do it again.
Hey, bloody Romans!
we're gettin' in through the underground heating system here, up through into the main audience chamber here, and Pilate's wife's bedroom is here.
having grabbed his wife, we inform Pilate that she is in our custody...
and forthwith issue our demands.
any questions? What exactly are the demands?
we're giving Pilate two days to dismantle...
the entire apparatus of the Roman lmperialist State, and if he doesn't agree immediately, we execute her.
cut her head off? Cut all her bits off.
send them back on the hour, every hour.
and, of course, we point out that they bear full responsibility when we chop her up...
and that we shall not submit to blackmail.
no blackmail!
they bled us white, the bastards. They've taken everything we had.
and not just from us. From our fathers and from our fathers' fathers.
and from our fathers' fathers' fathers. Yeah.
and from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers. Don't labor the point.
and what have they ever given us in return?
the aqueduct. What?
the aqueduct.
Oh, yeah, yeah. They did give us that.
and the sanitation.
Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg. Remember what the city used to be like.
Yeah, I'll grant you, the aqueduct and sanitation are two things the Romans have done.
and the roads. Well, obviously the roads.
I mean, the roads go without saying, don't they?
but apart from the sanitation, the aqueduct and the roads
irrigation. Medicine.
education. Yeah, all right. Fair enough.
and the wine.
Yeah, that's something we'd really miss, Reg, if the Romans left.
public baths. And it's safe to walk in the streets at night.
Yeah, they certainly keep order. They're the only ones who could in a place like this.
all right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?
brought peace. Oh, peace! Shut up!
I'm a poor man. My sight is poor.
my legs are old and bent.
it's all right, Matthias.
it's all clear.
well, where's Reg?
Oh, Reg. Reg, Judith.
what went wrong? The first blow has been struck.
did he finish the slogan? A hundred times, in letters ten foot high, all the way around the palace.
Oh, great. Great.
we. We need doers in our movement, Brian, but before you join us, know this:
there is not one of us who would not gladly suffer death to rid this country of the Romans once and for all.
Oh, yeah, there's one.
but otherwise, we're solid. Are you with us?
Yes.
from now on you shall be called "Brian that is called Brian."
tell him about the raid on Pilate's palace, Francis.
right. This is the plan.
now, this is the palace on Caesar's Square.
our commando unit will approach from Fish Street under cover of night...
and make our way to the northwestern main drain.
if questioned, we are sewage workers on our way to a conference.
Reg, our glorious leader and founder of the P. F.J. will be coordinating consultant at the drain head, though he himself will not be taking part in any terrorist action...
as he has a bad back.
aren't you going to come with us? Solidarity, brother.
Oh, yes, solidarity, Reg.
once in the sewer, timing will be of the essence.
there is a Roman feast later in the evening, so you must move fast.
and don't wear your best sandals.
turning left here, we enter the CaesarAugustus memorial sewer, and from there proceed directly to the hypocaust.
this has just been retiled. So, terrorists, careful with those weapons.
we will now be directly beneath Pilate's audience chamber itself.
this is the moment for Habbakuk to get out his prong.
Shhh. Shhh.
campaign for Free Galilee.
Oh, uh, People's Front of Judea. Officials.
Oh. What's your group doing here?
we're gonna kidnap Pilate's wife, take her back, issue demands.
so are we. That's our plan. What?
we were here first. What do you mean?
we thought of it first. We did!
Yes, a couple of years ago. We did!
come on. You got all your demands worked out, then?
of course we have. What are they?
well, I'm not telling you. Oh, come on!
that's not the point. We thought of it before you.
did not! We did!
you bastards, we've been planning this for months.
well, tough pity for you, Fish Face. Oh!
brothers, we should be struggling together.
we mustn't fight each other.
surely, we should be united against the common enemy.
the Judean People's Front!
no, no, the Romans!
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he's right.
right. Where were we? You were gonna punch me.
brothers!
what
you lucky bastard.
who's that?
you lucky, lucky bastard.
what? Quite the little jailer's pet, are we?
what do you mean? You must've slipped him a few shekels.
slipped him a few shekels? You saw him spit in my face.
Oh, what wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face!
I sometimes hang awake at night dreaming of being spat at in the face.
well, it's not exactly friendly. They have me in manacles.
manacles?
my idea of heaven is to be allowed to be put in manacles...
just for a few hours.
they must think the sun shines out of your ass, son.
Oh, lay off me! I've had a hard time!
you've had a hard time? I've been here five years.
they only hung me the right way up yesterday, so don't you
all right, all right.
they must think you're Lord God Almighty.
what will they do to me? Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion.
crucifixion? Yeah, first offense.
get away with crucifixion? It's
best thing the Romans ever did for us. What?
Oh, yeah, if we didn't have crucifixion, this country'd be in a bloody mess.
guard! Nail him up, I say!
guard! Nail some sense into him!
what do you want?
I want you to move me to another cell.
Aah! Oh, look at that! Bloody favoritism.
shut up, you! Sorry.
now take my case. They hung me up here five years ago.
every night, they take me down for 20 minutes, then they hang me up again, which I regard as very fair in view of what I've done.
and if nothing else, it's taught me to respect the Romans, and it's taught me that you'll never get anywhere in this life...
unless you're prepared to do a fair day's work for a fair day's
Oh, shut up!
here. Pilate wants to see you.
me? Come on!
Pilate? What's he want to see me for?
I think he wants to know which way up you want to be crucified.
nice one, centurion. Like it.
shut up! Right, right.
terrific race, the Romans. Terrific!
hail Caesar. Hail.
only one survivor, sir. Oh. "Throw" him to the floor.
what's that? Throw him to the floor.
Oh.
now, what is your name, Jew?
Brian, sir. "Bwian," eh?
no, no. Brian.
Aah!
the little rascal has "spiwit."
has what, sir? "Spiwit."
Yes, he did, sir.
no, no. "Spiwit," "bwavado," a touch of "dewwingdo."
Oh, uh, about 11, sir.
so, you dare to "waid" us?
to what, sir?
"strike" him, centurion, very "roughly."
Aah! And "throw" him to the floor, sir?
what? "Throw" him to the floor again, sir?
Oh, yes, "throw" him to the floor, please.
Aah! Now, Jewish "wapscallion"
I'm not Jewish. I'm a Roman.
a "Woman"? No, no. Roman.
Aah!
so, your father was a "Woman." Who was he?
he was a centurion in the Jerusalem garrison, sir.
Really? What was his name?
Naughtius Maximus.
centurion, do you have anyone of that name in the garrison?
well, no, sir.
well, you sound very sure. Have you checked?
well, no, sir. I think it's a joke, sir.
like, uh, "Sillius Soddus" or "Biggus Dickus," sir.
what's funny about "Biggus Dickus"?
well, it's a joke name, sir.
I have a very great friend in Rome called Biggus Dickus.
Silence! What is all this insolence?
you will find yourself in gladiator school "very" quickly...
with "rotten" behavior like that.
can I go now, sir? Aaah!
wait till Biggus Dickus hears of this.
"Right"! Take him away!
Oh, sir, he I want him fighting wild, "rabid" animals within a week.
Yes, sir. Come on, you.
I will not have my friends "ridiculed" by the common "soldiery."
anyone else feel like a little giggle...
when I mention my "friend,"
Biggus...
Dickus?
what about you? Do you find it "risible..."
when I say the name...
Biggus... Dickus?
he has a wife, you know?
you know what she's called?
she's called "Incontinentia."
Incontinentia Buttocks.
shut up! What is all this?
I've had enough of this "rowdy," "rebel" behavior!
Silence! Quiet! "Praetowian" guards!
seize him! Seize him! Blow your noses and seize him!
hmm? Hmm.
Oh, you lucky bastard.
and the bezan shall be huge and black...
and the eyes thereof red with the blood of living creatures!
and the whore of Babylon shall ride forth on a threeheaded serpent!
and throughout the lands there'll be a great rubbing of parts.
the demon shall bear a ninebladed sword.
ninebladed not two or five or seven, but nine which he will wield on all wretched sinners, just like you, sir, there.
and the whoring shall be on the head of Addius.
there shall in that time be rumors of things going astray, um, and there shall be a great confusion as to where things really are.
and nobody will really know where lieth...
those little things...
with the sort of raffia work base that has an attachment.
at this time, a friend shall lose his friend's hammer, and the young shall not know where lieth...
the things possessed by their fathers...
that their fathers put there only just the night before about 8: 00.
yea, it is written in the Book of Cyril...
in that time
how much, quick? It's for the wife.
Oh, uh, 20 shekels. Right.
what? There you are.
wait a minute. What?
we're supposed to haggle. No, no, no. I've got to get
what do you mean, no? I haven't got time.
well, give it back, then. No, no. I just paid you.
Burt, this bloke won't haggle. Won't haggle?
all right. Do we have to?
I want 20 for that. I just gave you 20.
are you telling me that's not worth 20 shekels? No.
feel the quality. That's none of your goat. I'll give you 19, then.
no, no, no. Do it properly. What?
haggle properly. This isn't worth 19. You just said it was worth 20.
Oh, dear, oh, dear. Come on, haggle.
all right, I'll give you ten. That's more like it.
ten? Are you trying to insult me?
me with a poor, dying grandmother? Ten?
all right, I'll give you 11. Now you're gettin' it.
did I hear you right? Eleven? This cost me 12. You want to ruin me?
Seventeen? No, no, no, no. Seventeen.
eighteen. No, no. You go to 14 now.
all right, I'll give you 14. Fourteen? Are you joking?
that's what you told me to say! Oh, dear.
Oh, tell me what to say, please!
offer me 14. I'll give you 14.
he's offering me 14 for this! Fifteen!
seventeen. My last word. I won't take a penny less, or strike me dead.
sixteen. Done.
nice to do business with you.
I'll throw you in this as well. I don't want it, but thanks.
Burt. All right, all right.
now, where's the 16 you owe me? I just gave you 20.
right. That's four I owe you, then. That's right. That's fine.
I've got it here somewhere. That's four for the gourd.
four? For this gourd?
look at it! It's worth ten if it's worth a shekel.
you gave it to me for nothing. Yes, but it's worth ten.
all right, all right.
no, no, no, no. It's not worth ten.
you're supposed to argue. "Ten for that? You must be mad."
Oh, well. One born every minute.
Daniel. Daniel.
job. Job.
Joshua. Joshua.
judges. Judges.
and Brian. And Brian.
I now propose that all seven of these exbrothers...
be now entered in the minutes as probationary martyrs to the cause.
I second that, Reg. Thank you, Loretta. On the nod.
siblings, let us not be down on it.
one total catastrophe like this...
is just the beginning!
their glorious deaths shall unite us all in
look out!
Hello?
Matthias?
Reg? Go away.
Reg, it's me, Brian.
get off! Get off out of it!
Stan! Piss off.
Yeah, piss off. Bugger off.
Oh, shit!
coming.
yea, verily at that time it is written in the book of Obadiah, a man shall strike his donkey and his nephew's donkey.
my eyes are dim. I cannot see.
are you Matthias? Yes.
we have reason to believe you may be hiding one Brian of Nazareth, a member of the terrorist organization, the People's Front of Judea.
me? No. I'm just a poor old man.
I have no time for lawbreakers.
my legs are grey. My ears are nulled.
my eyes are old and bent.
quiet! Silly person.
guards, search the house.
you know the penalty laid down by Roman law...
for harboring a known criminal?
no. Crucifixion.
Oh.
nasty, eh? Could be worse.
what do you mean, "Could be worse"?
well, you could be stabbed.
stabbed? Takes a second. Crucifixion lasts hours.
it's a slow, horrible death.
well, at least it gets you out in the open air.
you're weird.
no, sir. Couldn't find anything, sir.
well, don't worry. You've not seen the last of us, weirdo.
big Nose. Watch it!
whew, that was lucky.
