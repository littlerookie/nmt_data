what kind of doctor are you?
he was kind of a local hero.
a high school football star.
so a pretty strong kid, huh?
I know he used to run out here on the mountain all the time.
that's not easy.
was he out here running today?
he was wearing sweats.
a crime of opportunity or was the unsub laying in wait for this kid specifically?
unsub?
unknown subject. The killer.
if it is a cult, do you think they cared who the victim was?
maybe. Maybe not.
so we're talking about a blitz attack on a high-risk victim
one who could defend himself with a weapon picked up at the scene.
disorganized offender. It could be a cult.
the manson crime scenes were textbook disorganized murder.
this looks like a heavily traveled area.
a lot of the locals walk these paths.
some tourists, too.
if you are gonna conduct a ritual killing?
would you do it in the middle of a traveled path?
well, if the other crime scene was a ritual site where the pentagram is
I might blitz the victim here and drag him to the other scene.
why didn't they?
does "lod" mean anything to you?
Uh-uh. I don't know of any significance in satanism, either.
well, I could have Garcia research this "lod" thing if I could get a call out.
not much of a chance of that out here.
are there any cults in the area that you know about?
secret groups?
people you see you don't know much about people who stay to themselves mostly.
this is a very religious area.
church on sundays, fellowship on wednesday, bible classes.
if there was a secret group, I'd probably know about it.
that's an inherent contradiction.
excuse me?
he means if there was a group being secretive you probably wouldn't know.
look, people out here just want a quiet place to raise their kids.
what I know is none of them are capable of doing this.
find anything interesting down there?
Yeah, it does look like some kind of ritual site.
have any of you ever heard the expression "lod" or the acronym "L. O.D."?
not me.
sheriff Bridges!
it's ok, Harris. Let her in.
was Adam Loyd killed out here?
who told you that, Veronica?
was he? My daughter was with him.
they were out running together this morning.
Oh, my god. I can't find her. Cherish is missing.
cherish is missing!
help me, please.
take her home.
we're looking for someone who can overpower our victim abduct a girl from a traveled path without being seen.
it certainly fits with the cult theory.
more than one unsub to control multiple victims.
but if the attack were ferocious enough a single unsub could, too.
kill Adam and grab the girl while she's in shock.
this is some rough country.
we only went 1/4 of a mile, and we almost got lost.
the unsub has to be from this area.
you don't just stumble onto a place like this.
JJ, where'd the sheriff go?
he's setting up a search party.
tell him I want him to use volunteers from the area. Locals.
do you want him to know why?
no, not yet.
is it wise to alienate him?
well, he thinks we're looking for a monster.
if we tell him we're looking for volunteers so we can profile who shows up he might call the whole thing off.
state won't be here for over an hour. We're not gonna wait.
I want you to gather everyone up and I'm going to assign grid locations.
Yes, sir.
you have a moment, sheriff?
I've got a missing girl, 100 square miles of woods, not enough men and in a couple of hours it's going to be dark.
have you considered using the people that live in the area?
I'm not gonna have civilians messing up the crime scene.
we can instruct them not to touch anything until a member of law enforcement arrives.
what if they get lost, too?
we can have them sign in to a volunteer sheet and keep track of what grid square they're in.
look...I grew up in a small town.
you have the state police coming in?
Yeah.
your locals can do a better job of finding this girl than any statie.
you know that.
you'll keep track of 'em?
I've coordinated searches all over the country.
let's go.
Harris, I'm going downtown.
don't do anything until I get back, all right?
Hey, can I come with you guys?
I need to call Quantico and have them research that whole "lod" thing.
Yeah, sure. Hop in.
what's happened, John?
Reverend Paul Burke, this is
I'm sorry, I forgot your names.
I'm agent Jareau. This is Dr. Reid.
they're with the FBI.
FBI? It's true, then? Adam's dead?
cherish Hanson's missing, too.
is there anything I can do?
actually, yes. We're putting together a search party.
could you call the congregation?
of course. Of course. I'll go make some calls.
Thanks, Reverend. This way.
use any phone, doc, you just dial 9 to get an outside line.
I've got an emergency phone list back here in my office.
did you play ball?
no.
Yeah, I probably wouldn't have, either, if not for my father.
I'm Cory.
who's that, nietzsche?
thus spake zarathustra" was rather antagonistic of the judeo-christian world view for this town, isn't it?
I don't think too many people here would've bothered to read it.
if they had, they wouldn't understand it.
might as well be a hawking essay on quark theory.
nobody ever got that reference before.
is my father around?
the sheriff?
he's in his office with another agent.
agent?
I'm with the FBI, behavioral analysis unit.
Profilers?
ha. This is mad cool.
I got, like 100 questions I go
wait. Why would FBI profilers be here in McAllister?
there was a murder outside of town on the mountain.
a murder?
a girl's missing.
it's Cherish, son.
we're putting together a search party.
I need you to get the rest of the team together and meet us out at the trail about 1/2 mile south of the point.
Yeah. Ok.
came as soon as I heard, sheriff.
good morning, Henry.
sign in with this lady here then just stand by for a few minutes.
everyone, please, as soon as you've signed in make your way back to the police cars.
that's where you'll be assigned your groups. Thank you.
I grew up in Brooklyn.
you couldn't get this many people out for anything less than free money.
well, here come the jocks and cheerleaders.
ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
now, you're all assigned grid squares to search.
each grid has a deputy or an FBI agent.
you find anything, do not touch it.
just let your grid leader know.
now, are there any questions?
all right. Everyone get in your group now.
all right, you guys, let's head out.
you have the sign-in sheets?
Yeah.
is Garcia standing by to do background on them all?
I got a deputy waiting to take me back to the station.
I'm gonna fax her soon as I get there.
good. This type of unsub can't resist injecting himself into a show like this.
he's here with us.
man, this is one peyton place of a town.
most everyone lives well above the median income of the country.
you got doctors, lawyers...
one guy owns a bunch of shoe stores up and down the eastern seaboard.
ha. Is he married?
Yeah. Story of my life, sunshine.
Reverend Paul Burke, looks like he became born again in prison.
prison?
Yeah, 2 years as a guest of the state of Ohio for embezzlement.
I'm seeing a lot of tax sheltering and various hanky-panky here but I'm not sure what would suggest potential satanic cult members hold on.
wait, you got something?
Yeah, I got a guy with a ton of debts spotty work history, his house is in foreclosure.
he's got a record, too assault with a deadly weapon 3 years ago.
wait. Does it say what the weapon was?
baseball bat.
our unsub used a blunt object.
bats are blunt, aren't they?
what's this guy's name?
OK. Here he is. "Grid b-5." Ok, that puts him with...Elle.
you all right there?
way to scare a girl.
saw you bent over.
I was tying my shoe.
these almost never come untied.
good for you.
my name's Henry.
well, then good for you, Henry.
I'm Elle.
like the letter?
that's a different kind of name.
had it all my life.
that's funny. Your whole life.
you're with the FBI, right?
that must be exciting.
it has its moments.
it's dangerous, too, right?
I mean, you go after killers and things.
really bad guys.
you ever have to shoot
Satan commands the virgin be sacrificed at the next full moon.
that's tonight, isn't it?
Wh--what's that?
blood.
tired?
I'm fine.
we all get them sometimes.
get what?
nightmares.
it's not that bad.
you want to talk about it, you know where I am.
uh, they're ready.
okay.
contrary to popular belief there has never been a proven case of satanic ritual killing.
never a verified human sacrifice.
having said that, there have been isolated cases of animal sacrifice...
many, many cases of vandalism in the name of satan.
but that doesn't mean that ritual satanism is impossible.
more importantly, for our purposes there have been cults that killed, just not in ritual fashion.
the Reverend Jim Jones and the peoples temple...
his followers killed a U. S. Congressman and 3 people before committing mass suicide and leaving over 900 people dead.
and perhaps the most widely-known of the killer cults the Manson family under the direction of Charles Manson killed 9 people in a 4-day period in an attempt to initiate a race war.
killer cults do exist, and they all have one thing in common...
invariably they're headed by charismatic megalomaniacs.
you're looking for that leader. He's who will stand out.
he'll be memorable to somebody, people who aren't in his group will see him as strange, weird, scary.
since we're dealing with professed satanists which is often practiced by younger males we may be looking for teenagers.
heavy metal music is often associated with satanism and these kids and their leader may reflect that in their look.
most likely, there'll be sex, drugs and alcohol.
and the leader, he'll be older.
it's part of his charm.
and he is from this area.
he's definitely local.
these woods are too thick and confusing for a visitor to get around in.
you think one of our own people is doing this?
we're sure of it.
I would know if someone was capable of doing
dad. I know somebody like that.
his name's Mike Zizzo.
he graduated about 5 years ago.
he's in his 20s, but he still hangs out with high school kids.
he's got a group of them.
they follow him everywhere.
they all get high and listen to heavy metal.
he calls them the lords of destruction.
how do you know this, Cory?
it's all right, son.
I've been there, where they hang out drinking beers.
he talks about Satan all the time.
says he's the one true god.
where is this place?
on the other side of the mountain. The old Jenson house.
it's out of my jurisdiction.
not ours.
sorry, dad.
I'm not going on the raid.
what's up?
I don't know yet.
FBI! Don't move!
I said turn the music down now!
up against the wall! Everybody up against the wall now!
up against the wall!
do you believe in god?
excuse me?
do you believe in god?
Yes.
how about the devil?
is someone going to tell me why I'm here or are we just going to play staring games all night?
this was found where Cherish Hanson went missing.
no wonder everyone's all freaked out.
McAllister's perfect debutante is in trouble.
read the note.
you think someone threatening to kill this girl is funny?
no, I think someone calling Cherish Hanson a virgin is funny.
you're a satanist, Mike?
sure.
and you worship the devil?
you know what satanism is?
educate us.
the word Satan comes from ancient Hebrew. It just means opposer.
Satan opposes the hypocritical morals and dogmas of the so-called holy church and its followers.
if you grew up in this town with god shoved down your throat every day you'd oppose it, too.
it's all hypocrisy. Do this. Don't do that.
and all the time, the adults are the ones screwing up.
so basically we're just atheists. Aggressively atheist.
how aggressive, Mike?
you're one of the FBI agents, aren't you?
is there something you want to tell me?
do you think god is vengeful?
I don't know.
you don't think he punishes us?
after hurricane Katrina, I read some essays by religious scholars.
one writer said god was punishing America for its immorality.
new Orleans was a wicked city, like Sodom and Gomorrah.
another one, a priest from New Orleans he thought the hurricane was proof of god's love.
those levees didn't break until after the storm was over.
if they'd broken sooner, thousands would've died.
so...
I guess the answer to your question depends on whether or not you think you have something to be punished for.
my friend Cherish...
she's missing.
and it's my fault.
I've got to give the sheriff a report.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
you guys need anything?
coffee would be nice.
he takes about a quart of sugar in it.
2 teaspoons is fine.
you got it.
you knew I didn't want you to tell Hotch about my nightmares.
Reid, that's something they need to know about.
what do you mean "they"?
Hotch and Gideon.
you told Gideon, too?
Yeah, and it's ok, kid.
what if they think I can't do my job?
what if they want to pull me off the team?
they won't. - Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
I just do.
you had no right, man. I--I confided in you.
you know, this is exactly what I get when I trust someone.
it gets thrown back in my face.
mine started 6 months after I got into the B. A.U.
Yeah. Mine.
we were working a strangler case in Montana.
four victims.
me, I was still pretty young at the time so you know, I was feeling myself.
I was cocky, I was arrogant.
the locals, they didn't have anything, so I stepped up.
I said I can nail down a profile for you just as soon as I can get what I need.
more victims?
she was found the next day.
so I went down to the scene to do my thing.
and as I was looking over the body, that's when I saw them.
her eyes, Reid.
they were wide open.
and there was something different about them it was like they were looking right at me.
like she knew.
I asked for a victim.
well, here she was.
that's when they started for me.
night after night I would fall asleep and I would see those eyes.
they were dead eyes. Accusing eyes.
and it got to the point where it was happening even when I wasn't asleep.
Reid, everywhere I went, I saw those eyes.
what did you do?
he knew. I didn't tell him.
I was like you. I didn't want anybody to know.
he just...he knew.
and he sat me down and he just kind of talked me through it.
I still have the nightmares to this day, just not nearly as often.
but when they come back, I know how to handle them better.
what did he say?
did you find her?
no.
did Zizzo say anything?
we don't know. We've been here the whole time.
cory, calm down.
how am I supposed to calm down?
cherish is missing. Did you check all over?
we searched the whole house.
what about the outbuilding?
outbuilding?
did you check the other area? Back in the woods?
I didn't know there was another area.
Yeah, it's like a sluice structure or something.
he took me there once. It's this way.
let's go.
the skeleton under the tree, he died a year ago.
he fell off the trail, cracked his head open.
he was just some tourist or something.
how do you know that?
we went to see the body all the time.
we watched it decompose.
who did?
we did. Everybody, the whole group.
what the hell is this?
why don't you tell us, Mike?
I've never seen this before.
pentagram, body, candles, L. O.D.
lords of destruction.
I've never seen this.
from where I stand, Mike, it looks like you signed it.
at first we were just curious, you know?
we would go, a couple of us at a time, show each other.
none of us had ever seen a dead body before.
and then it kind of became our thing.
something that we had that our parents didn't know about.
it was ours.
this was a human being.
I told you that we're being punished.
it's up here.
this is our secret place.
I can't believe this is happening.
this kind of thing doesn't happen in McAllister.
you said you read the profiling books.
you know bad things happen anywhere. Anywhere at anytime.
she in there?
is she all right?
cory, she's in there.
is she dead?
she can't be dead.
look, we drew our stars upside-down, get drunk, and listen to metal.
that's it. Hey, we don't kill people.
this is your chance to make this right, Zizzo.
you don't want to make it right.
you wanna blame someone who doesn't conform to your view of how people should act and think.
I need to talk to you, all of you.
Reid, I want you to go to the house and see if the deputies have come back.
what?
we need the sheriff and the crime scene team here.
but-- - Reid. Do it.
I can't--I can't believe Cherish
I'm sorry about your friend.
I saw her the other day.
it was a pep rally.
I've been with Brandy Dreifort. Do you know her?
she's a friend of my son's.
she's a friend of Cherish's, too.
And?
well, they all knew about the skeleton.
who did?
football team, cheerleaders, everyone.
they all watched this man decompose like it was a game for their amusement.
what?
as far as I can tell the only kids in that area who didn't know were Mike Zizzo and the L. O.D.
it's ridiculous.
sounds impossible, it's unbelievable.
she told me all about it.
the guy was a hiker or something.
probably have him listed, missing person somewhere.
Jason how do you know the L. O.D. wasn't involved?
well, she said the pentagram and the candles they weren't there a few months ago.
which means?
someone wanted us to believe there were satanists here.
Reid tells me you've read all the profiling books.
actually kinda hoping to be one of you guys someday.
are ya? So then you know what profilers do?
the unsub likes to inject himself into the investigation.
that's what this type of killer does.
who gave us is Zizzo?
who knew all about him?
you're talking about Cory?
it was convenient, wasn't it?
lucky we had a kid right in the room who could tell us where the L. O.D. was.
a group of fringe kids nobody in the town would like.
but you called us here to advise you.
my advice would be to get in front of this before your son hurts himself or anybody else.
you know where he is, sheriff?
he went up to the Jenson house to see if your guys found anything on Cherish.
morgan and Reid are out there right now.
Hey, sheriff. Did you open the gun locker?
no.
someone did. There's a revolver missing.
you know that we look at a crime scene from a different perspective than regular cops, right?
we look for more than just the evidence.
we try to pick up on the behavior of the killer.
for example, the guy we're looking for in this crime would be classified as a disorganized killer.
sounds like Zizzo, doesn't it?
Yeah. Sure it does.
but then again, sometimes a disorganized killer only looks disorganized.
sometimes it's actually an organized guy, and pretty smart guy.
somebody who can manipulate a crime scene to make it look like somebody else did it.
because of that, we also gotta look for someone who might try to put himself right in the middle of an investigation so that he can influence things.
especially if he knows exactly what it is that we're looking for.
I mean, he wants to control this, right?
and that would extend to discovery.
wantin' the body found when and especially where he wants that body found.
you mean me?
this was more than just a lucky guess, wasn't it?
I knew about the building.
you also knew about Zizzo and the satanism.
I was only trying to help.
well, you did that.
we couldn't have found this place without you.
hey Morgan, no one's up there.
get over here. - Reid. Reid.
Cory. - This got all messed up.
don't be stupid.
she wasn't supposed to be with him.
it was his run. He runs it every day, not her.
cory, listen to me. We can fix this.
but you've got to let Reid go.
I never meant to hurt her. But make no mistake
I will shoot your boy right now.
no, you won't.
tempt not a desperate man.
put the gun down. - Okay all right. You win.
drop it. Drop the gun!
OK. Ok. You win.
I'm putting the gun down.
you're in control, Cory. Let him go.
for the evil is man's best force. Man must become better and eviler.
that's what this is about, right?
Zarathustra? The superman?
there's no moral obligation for killing someone if you're superior to them?
but nietzsche was speaking metaphorically about evolving as a species.
you're just a horny kid who wanted to get rid of the cheerleader's boyfriend.
no. - Yes.
that was never my intent
come on.
you all right?
what happened?
him bringing us down here was way too much of a coincidence.
I got that.
but did you have to tackle us both?
you're welcome, Reid.
C'mon. Let's go, Cory.
playwright Eugene Ionesco said "ideologies separate us, dreams and anguish bring us together.
deborah Louise Addison. Her husband Tim.
the kids are Amber and Keith. Eight and six.
in 1985, Deborah Louise was walking home from school.
she was abducted. She was 13.
we profiled the unsub.
and we were able to locate her before he harmed her.
she writes a letter to the B. A.U. every year.
she updates us on her life.
it's nice, but
we all have bad dreams.
everyone on the plane. Who wouldn't?
we hunt the worst of humanity we see the depths of depravity, we dream of monsters.
in my dream there's a baby in the middle of a circle and there's someone on the other side.
and I can't get to her before
every night I look at Deborah helps me to go to sleep thinking of the victims we've saved.
we don't always beat the monsters to the babies but we do enough to make the job worth it keep the nightmares bearable.
how much farther?
what?
are we almost done?
you want to stop?
no.
let's rest a while.
I promised I wouldn't slow you down.
you go ahead. I'll catch up.
I can wait.
Adam, please. It's your workout.
go. I'll meet you at the point.
you're out of shape, cheerleader.
Oh, yeah?
let's see you do 3 back flips and land in the splits.
the point?
the point.
Hello?
is somebody there?
if you're trying to scare me, I'm gonna kill you.
Oh, my god. Adam, please wake up. Adam.
baby, please, baby. Please!
Noooo!
victim's the Loyd boy, isn't it?
the quarterback?
just saw his parents yesterday heading up to Nantucket.
listen get me their number up there, will you?
sheriff Bridges.
there's something here.
what is it?
you're gonna want to see this, sir.
looks like the head is busted open.
just like Adam Loyd.
you want me to get the crime scene folks down here?
Yeah.
wait. Hold on.
we're gonna need a lot more than the crime scene folks.
easy there, tough guy. Have some coffee with your sugar.
I need something to wake me up.
Ooh. Late night?
very.
my man.
not that kind of late night.
OK, so tell me, what does keep young Dr. Reid awake at night?
wait, let me guess.
memorizing some obscure textbook.
no, no, no, no.
working on cold fusion.
no, I got it.
watching Star Trek... and laughing at the physics mistakes.
actually, there aren't that many scientific errors in Star Trek.
especially considering how long ago it was made.
there are certain improbabilities, but not that many outright errors.
right.
Hey, Morgan?
uh, do you ever have dreams?
I'm sorry.
I guess nightmares would be a more accurate description.
is that what's keeping you up?
I used to get them occasionally but lately it's like I have them every night.
what are they about?
this. What we do.
do you have nightmares?
Reid, I'm not sure if I'm the right person for you to talk to about this.
why not?
it's just, uh...
did you ask Gideon about it?
no.
you should.
Hey, Hotch wants everyone in the round table room.
something up with you two?
no.
McAllister. Western slope of Massanutten mountain in Virginia.
2 bodies discovered in the woods both with apparent blunt trauma to the head.
skeletons?
one of them. The second victim was just killed this morning.
how do we know there's a connection?
they were found about 75 feet apart with nearly identical head wounds.
Where's the rest of the case file?
there isn't one. The sheriffs are on the scene waiting for us.
their location is only a half hour away by plane.
what's the rush?
well, there was evidence on the scene that could cause a bit of a public uproar.
a satanic cult.
so Peter Ustinov said, "unfortunately a super-abundance of dreams is paid for by a growing potential for nightmares.
JJ, we need to obviously, keep this out of the press for as long as possible.
I'll do what I can.
why is that so important?
there was a nationwide scare in the 1980s involving satanic ritual killings and abuse.
the satanic panic, it was called.
it began after the publication of a book about repressed memories being recovered through hypnotherapy.
memories of growing up with devil worshippers who use children in their rituals and ceremonies.
most of the claims were later found to be false or just impossible.
still, numerous therapists accepted the assertions as true and began searching for similar signs in their own patients.
after one year, thousands of people reported the exact same repressed memories.
the bureau conducted an investigation and concluded that most of the most of the ritual killings or abuse were more urban legend than anything else.
you're saying that there's no such thing as devil worship?
not at all.
but most of the satanism that we've seen is juveniles damaging property, desecrating churches, cemeteries.
to my knowledge, there has never been a proven case of a satanic ritual killing in the united states.
well, maybe there is now.
mornin'.
Yeah. We spoke on the phone.
I'm agent Jareau, and this is agent Gideon and Dr. Reid with the FBI's behavioral analysis unit.
Hi.
thanks for coming out so fast.
Yeah. Of course.
there was an in-service in Charlottesville last year said if we ran into any unusual homicides we were supposed to call you folks sooner rather than later.
Yeah, they were right.
is this unusual enough?
it certainly is interesting.
you guys must get a lot of this, huh?
satanic stuff?
not really.
who found the bodies?
a hiker found the first one at the trail and my deputies located this one while searching for evidence.
we don't even know if it's a man or a woman.
it's a man.
the male pelvis is more narrow and the opening at the bottom is heart-shaped, as opposed to oval.
melted wax?
candle wax?
candles are used in rituals.
they're also used on birthday cakes.
actually, they were originally used to protect the birthday celebrant from demons for the coming year.
as a matter of fact, down to the fourth century christianity rejected the birthday celebration as a pagan ritual.
what kind of doctor are you?
he was kind of a local hero.
a high school football star.
so a pretty strong kid, huh?
I know he used to run out here on the mountain all the time.
that's not easy.
was he out here running today?
he was wearing sweats.
a crime of opportunity or was the unsub laying in wait for this kid specifically?
unsub?
unknown subject. The killer.
if it is a cult, do you think they cared who the victim was?
maybe. Maybe not.
so we're talking about a blitz attack on a high-risk victim
one who could defend himself with a weapon picked up at the scene.
disorganized offender. It could be a cult.
the manson crime scenes were textbook disorganized murder.
this looks like a heavily traveled area.
a lot of the locals walk these paths.
some tourists, too.
if you are gonna conduct a ritual killing?
would you do it in the middle of a traveled path?
well, if the other crime scene was a ritual site where the pentagram is
I might blitz the victim here and drag him to the other scene.
why didn't they?
does "lod" mean anything to you?
Uh-uh. I don't know of any significance in satanism, either.
well, I could have Garcia research this "lod" thing if I could get a call out.
not much of a chance of that out here.
are there any cults in the area that you know about?
secret groups?
people you see you don't know much about people who stay to themselves mostly.
this is a very religious area.
church on sundays, fellowship on wednesday, bible classes.
if there was a secret group, I'd probably know about it.
that's an inherent contradiction.
excuse me?
he means if there was a group being secretive you probably wouldn't know.
look, people out here just want a quiet place to raise their kids.
what I know is none of them are capable of doing this.
find anything interesting down there?
Yeah, it does look like some kind of ritual site.
have any of you ever heard the expression "lod" or the acronym "L. O.D."?
not me.
sheriff Bridges!
it's ok, Harris. Let her in.
was Adam Loyd killed out here?
who told you that, Veronica?
was he? My daughter was with him.
they were out running together this morning.
Oh, my god. I can't find her. Cherish is missing.
cherish is missing!
help me, please.
take her home.
we're looking for someone who can overpower our victim abduct a girl from a traveled path without being seen.
it certainly fits with the cult theory.
more than one unsub to control multiple victims.
but if the attack were ferocious enough a single unsub could, too.
kill Adam and grab the girl while she's in shock.
this is some rough country.
we only went 1/4 of a mile, and we almost got lost.
the unsub has to be from this area.
you don't just stumble onto a place like this.
JJ, where'd the sheriff go?
he's setting up a search party.
tell him I want him to use volunteers from the area. Locals.
do you want him to know why?
no, not yet.
is it wise to alienate him?
well, he thinks we're looking for a monster.
if we tell him we're looking for volunteers so we can profile who shows up he might call the whole thing off.
state won't be here for over an hour. We're not gonna wait.
I want you to gather everyone up and I'm going to assign grid locations.
Yes, sir.
you have a moment, sheriff?
I've got a missing girl, 100 square miles of woods, not enough men and in a couple of hours it's going to be dark.
have you considered using the people that live in the area?
I'm not gonna have civilians messing up the crime scene.
we can instruct them not to touch anything until a member of law enforcement arrives.
what if they get lost, too?
we can have them sign in to a volunteer sheet and keep track of what grid square they're in.
look...I grew up in a small town.
you have the state police coming in?
Yeah.
your locals can do a better job of finding this girl than any statie.
you know that.
you'll keep track of 'em?
I've coordinated searches all over the country.
let's go.
Harris, I'm going downtown.
don't do anything until I get back, all right?
Hey, can I come with you guys?
I need to call Quantico and have them research that whole "lod" thing.
Yeah, sure. Hop in.
what's happened, John?
Reverend Paul Burke, this is
I'm sorry, I forgot your names.
I'm agent Jareau. This is Dr. Reid.
they're with the FBI.
FBI? It's true, then? Adam's dead?
cherish Hanson's missing, too.
is there anything I can do?
actually, yes. We're putting together a search party.
could you call the congregation?
of course. Of course. I'll go make some calls.
Thanks, Reverend. This way.
use any phone, doc, you just dial 9 to get an outside line.
I've got an emergency phone list back here in my office.
did you play ball?
no.
Yeah, I probably wouldn't have, either, if not for my father.
I'm Cory.
who's that, nietzsche?
thus spake zarathustra" was rather antagonistic of the judeo-christian world view for this town, isn't it?
I don't think too many people here would've bothered to read it.
if they had, they wouldn't understand it.
might as well be a hawking essay on quark theory.
nobody ever got that reference before.
is my father around?
the sheriff?
he's in his office with another agent.
agent?
I'm with the FBI, behavioral analysis unit.
Profilers?
ha. This is mad cool.
I got, like 100 questions I go
wait. Why would FBI profilers be here in McAllister?
there was a murder outside of town on the mountain.
a murder?
a girl's missing.
it's Cherish, son.
we're putting together a search party.
I need you to get the rest of the team together and meet us out at the trail about 1/2 mile south of the point.
Yeah. Ok.
came as soon as I heard, sheriff.
good morning, Henry.
sign in with this lady here then just stand by for a few minutes.
everyone, please, as soon as you've signed in make your way back to the police cars.
that's where you'll be assigned your groups. Thank you.
I grew up in Brooklyn.
you couldn't get this many people out for anything less than free money.
well, here come the jocks and cheerleaders.
ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?
now, you're all assigned grid squares to search.
each grid has a deputy or an FBI agent.
you find anything, do not touch it.
just let your grid leader know.
now, are there any questions?
all right. Everyone get in your group now.
all right, you guys, let's head out.
you have the sign-in sheets?
Yeah.
is Garcia standing by to do background on them all?
I got a deputy waiting to take me back to the station.
I'm gonna fax her soon as I get there.
good. This type of unsub can't resist injecting himself into a show like this.
he's here with us.
man, this is one peyton place of a town.
most everyone lives well above the median income of the country.
you got doctors, lawyers...
one guy owns a bunch of shoe stores up and down the eastern seaboard.
ha. Is he married?
Yeah. Story of my life, sunshine.
Reverend Paul Burke, looks like he became born again in prison.
prison?
Yeah, 2 years as a guest of the state of Ohio for embezzlement.
I'm seeing a lot of tax sheltering and various hanky-panky here but I'm not sure what would suggest potential satanic cult members hold on.
wait, you got something?
Yeah, I got a guy with a ton of debts spotty work history, his house is in foreclosure.
he's got a record, too assault with a deadly weapon 3 years ago.
wait. Does it say what the weapon was?
baseball bat.
our unsub used a blunt object.
bats are blunt, aren't they?
what's this guy's name?
OK. Here he is. "Grid b-5." Ok, that puts him with...Elle.
you all right there?
way to scare a girl.
saw you bent over.
I was tying my shoe.
these almost never come untied.
good for you.
my name's Henry.
well, then good for you, Henry.
I'm Elle.
like the letter?
that's a different kind of name.
had it all my life.
that's funny. Your whole life.
you're with the FBI, right?
that must be exciting.
it has its moments.
it's dangerous, too, right?
I mean, you go after killers and things.
really bad guys.
you ever have to shoot
Satan commands the virgin be sacrificed at the next full moon.
that's tonight, isn't it?
Wh--what's that?
blood.
tired?
I'm fine.
we all get them sometimes.
get what?
nightmares.
it's not that bad.
you want to talk about it, you know where I am.
uh, they're ready.
okay.
contrary to popular belief there has never been a proven case of satanic ritual killing.
never a verified human sacrifice.
having said that, there have been isolated cases of animal sacrifice...
many, many cases of vandalism in the name of satan.
but that doesn't mean that ritual satanism is impossible.
more importantly, for our purposes there have been cults that killed, just not in ritual fashion.
the Reverend Jim Jones and the peoples temple...
his followers killed a U. S. Congressman and 3 people before committing mass suicide and leaving over 900 people dead.
and perhaps the most widely-known of the killer cults the Manson family under the direction of Charles Manson killed 9 people in a 4-day period in an attempt to initiate a race war.
killer cults do exist, and they all have one thing in common...
invariably they're headed by charismatic megalomaniacs.
you're looking for that leader. He's who will stand out.
he'll be memorable to somebody, people who aren't in his group will see him as strange, weird, scary.
since we're dealing with professed satanists which is often practiced by younger males we may be looking for teenagers.
heavy metal music is often associated with satanism and these kids and their leader may reflect that in their look.
most likely, there'll be sex, drugs and alcohol.
and the leader, he'll be older.
it's part of his charm.
and he is from this area.
he's definitely local.
these woods are too thick and confusing for a visitor to get around in.
you think one of our own people is doing this?
we're sure of it.
I would know if someone was capable of doing
dad. I know somebody like that.
his name's Mike Zizzo.
he graduated about 5 years ago.
he's in his 20s, but he still hangs out with high school kids.
he's got a group of them.
they follow him everywhere.
they all get high and listen to heavy metal.
he calls them the lords of destruction.
how do you know this, Cory?
it's all right, son.
I've been there, where they hang out drinking beers.
he talks about Satan all the time.
says he's the one true god.
where is this place?
on the other side of the mountain. The old Jenson house.
it's out of my jurisdiction.
not ours.
sorry, dad.
I'm not going on the raid.
what's up?
I don't know yet.
FBI! Don't move!
I said turn the music down now!
up against the wall! Everybody up against the wall now!
up against the wall!
do you believe in god?
excuse me?
do you believe in god?
Yes.
how about the devil?
is someone going to tell me why I'm here or are we just going to play staring games all night?
this was found where Cherish Hanson went missing.
no wonder everyone's all freaked out.
McAllister's perfect debutante is in trouble.
read the note.
you think someone threatening to kill this girl is funny?
no, I think someone calling Cherish Hanson a virgin is funny.
you're a satanist, Mike?
sure.
and you worship the devil?
you know what satanism is?
educate us.
the word Satan comes from ancient Hebrew. It just means opposer.
Satan opposes the hypocritical morals and dogmas of the so-called holy church and its followers.
if you grew up in this town with god shoved down your throat every day you'd oppose it, too.
it's all hypocrisy. Do this. Don't do that.
and all the time, the adults are the ones screwing up.
so basically we're just atheists. Aggressively atheist.
how aggressive, Mike?
you're one of the FBI agents, aren't you?
is there something you want to tell me?
do you think god is vengeful?
I don't know.
you don't think he punishes us?
after hurricane Katrina, I read some essays by religious scholars.
one writer said god was punishing America for its immorality.
new Orleans was a wicked city, like Sodom and Gomorrah.
another one, a priest from New Orleans he thought the hurricane was proof of god's love.
those levees didn't break until after the storm was over.
if they'd broken sooner, thousands would've died.
so...
I guess the answer to your question depends on whether or not you think you have something to be punished for.
my friend Cherish...
she's missing.
and it's my fault.
I've got to give the sheriff a report.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
you guys need anything?
coffee would be nice.
he takes about a quart of sugar in it.
2 teaspoons is fine.
you got it.
you knew I didn't want you to tell Hotch about my nightmares.
Reid, that's something they need to know about.
what do you mean "they"?
Hotch and Gideon.
you told Gideon, too?
Yeah, and it's ok, kid.
what if they think I can't do my job?
what if they want to pull me off the team?
they won't. - Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
I just do.
you had no right, man. I--I confided in you.
you know, this is exactly what I get when I trust someone.
it gets thrown back in my face.
mine started 6 months after I got into the B. A.U.
Yeah. Mine.
we were working a strangler case in Montana.
four victims.
me, I was still pretty young at the time so you know, I was feeling myself.
I was cocky, I was arrogant.
the locals, they didn't have anything, so I stepped up.
I said I can nail down a profile for you just as soon as I can get what I need.
more victims?
she was found the next day.
so I went down to the scene to do my thing.
and as I was looking over the body, that's when I saw them.
her eyes, Reid.
they were wide open.
and there was something different about them it was like they were looking right at me.
like she knew.
I asked for a victim.
well, here she was.
that's when they started for me.
night after night I would fall asleep and I would see those eyes.
they were dead eyes. Accusing eyes.
and it got to the point where it was happening even when I wasn't asleep.
Reid, everywhere I went, I saw those eyes.
what did you do?
he knew. I didn't tell him.
I was like you. I didn't want anybody to know.
he just...he knew.
and he sat me down and he just kind of talked me through it.
I still have the nightmares to this day, just not nearly as often.
but when they come back, I know how to handle them better.
what did he say?
did you find her?
no.
did Zizzo say anything?
we don't know. We've been here the whole time.
cory, calm down.
how am I supposed to calm down?
cherish is missing. Did you check all over?
we searched the whole house.
what about the outbuilding?
outbuilding?
did you check the other area? Back in the woods?
I didn't know there was another area.
Yeah, it's like a sluice structure or something.
he took me there once. It's this way.
let's go.
the skeleton under the tree, he died a year ago.
he fell off the trail, cracked his head open.
he was just some tourist or something.
how do you know that?
we went to see the body all the time.
we watched it decompose.
who did?
we did. Everybody, the whole group.
what the hell is this?
why don't you tell us, Mike?
I've never seen this before.
pentagram, body, candles, L. O.D.
lords of destruction.
I've never seen this.
from where I stand, Mike, it looks like you signed it.
at first we were just curious, you know?
we would go, a couple of us at a time, show each other.
none of us had ever seen a dead body before.
and then it kind of became our thing.
something that we had that our parents didn't know about.
it was ours.
this was a human being.
I told you that we're being punished.
it's up here.
this is our secret place.
I can't believe this is happening.
this kind of thing doesn't happen in McAllister.
you said you read the profiling books.
you know bad things happen anywhere. Anywhere at anytime.
she in there?
is she all right?
cory, she's in there.
is she dead?
she can't be dead.
look, we drew our stars upside-down, get drunk, and listen to metal.
that's it. Hey, we don't kill people.
this is your chance to make this right, Zizzo.
you don't want to make it right.
you wanna blame someone who doesn't conform to your view of how people should act and think.
I need to talk to you, all of you.
Reid, I want you to go to the house and see if the deputies have come back.
what?
we need the sheriff and the crime scene team here.
but-- - Reid. Do it.
I can't--I can't believe Cherish
I'm sorry about your friend.
I saw her the other day.
it was a pep rally.
I've been with Brandy Dreifort. Do you know her?
she's a friend of my son's.
she's a friend of Cherish's, too.
And?
well, they all knew about the skeleton.
who did?
football team, cheerleaders, everyone.
they all watched this man decompose like it was a game for their amusement.
what?
as far as I can tell the only kids in that area who didn't know were Mike Zizzo and the L. O.D.
it's ridiculous.
sounds impossible, it's unbelievable.
she told me all about it.
the guy was a hiker or something.
probably have him listed, missing person somewhere.
Jason how do you know the L. O.D. wasn't involved?
well, she said the pentagram and the candles they weren't there a few months ago.
which means?
someone wanted us to believe there were satanists here.
Reid tells me you've read all the profiling books.
actually kinda hoping to be one of you guys someday.
are ya? So then you know what profilers do?
the unsub likes to inject himself into the investigation.
that's what this type of killer does.
who gave us is Zizzo?
who knew all about him?
you're talking about Cory?
it was convenient, wasn't it?
lucky we had a kid right in the room who could tell us where the L. O.D. was.
a group of fringe kids nobody in the town would like.
but you called us here to advise you.
my advice would be to get in front of this before your son hurts himself or anybody else.
you know where he is, sheriff?
he went up to the Jenson house to see if your guys found anything on Cherish.
morgan and Reid are out there right now.
Hey, sheriff. Did you open the gun locker?
no.
someone did. There's a revolver missing.
you know that we look at a crime scene from a different perspective than regular cops, right?
we look for more than just the evidence.
we try to pick up on the behavior of the killer.
for example, the guy we're looking for in this crime would be classified as a disorganized killer.
sounds like Zizzo, doesn't it?
Yeah. Sure it does.
but then again, sometimes a disorganized killer only looks disorganized.
sometimes it's actually an organized guy, and pretty smart guy.
somebody who can manipulate a crime scene to make it look like somebody else did it.
because of that, we also gotta look for someone who might try to put himself right in the middle of an investigation so that he can influence things.
especially if he knows exactly what it is that we're looking for.
I mean, he wants to control this, right?
and that would extend to discovery.
wantin' the body found when and especially where he wants that body found.
you mean me?
this was more than just a lucky guess, wasn't it?
I knew about the building.
you also knew about Zizzo and the satanism.
I was only trying to help.
well, you did that.
we couldn't have found this place without you.
hey Morgan, no one's up there.
get over here. - Reid. Reid.
Cory. - This got all messed up.
don't be stupid.
she wasn't supposed to be with him.
it was his run. He runs it every day, not her.
cory, listen to me. We can fix this.
but you've got to let Reid go.
I never meant to hurt her. But make no mistake
I will shoot your boy right now.
no, you won't.
tempt not a desperate man.
put the gun down. - Okay all right. You win.
drop it. Drop the gun!
OK. Ok. You win.
I'm putting the gun down.
you're in control, Cory. Let him go.
for the evil is man's best force. Man must become better and eviler.
that's what this is about, right?
Zarathustra? The superman?
there's no moral obligation for killing someone if you're superior to them?
but nietzsche was speaking metaphorically about evolving as a species.
you're just a horny kid who wanted to get rid of the cheerleader's boyfriend.
no. - Yes.
that was never my intent
come on.
you all right?
what happened?
him bringing us down here was way too much of a coincidence.
I got that.
but did you have to tackle us both?
you're welcome, Reid.
C'mon. Let's go, Cory.
playwright Eugene Ionesco said "ideologies separate us, dreams and anguish bring us together.
deborah Louise Addison. Her husband Tim.
the kids are Amber and Keith. Eight and six.
in 1985, Deborah Louise was walking home from school.
she was abducted. She was 13.
we profiled the unsub.
and we were able to locate her before he harmed her.
she writes a letter to the B. A.U. every year.
she updates us on her life.
it's nice, but
we all have bad dreams.
everyone on the plane. Who wouldn't?
we hunt the worst of humanity we see the depths of depravity, we dream of monsters.
in my dream there's a baby in the middle of a circle and there's someone on the other side.
and I can't get to her before
every night I look at Deborah helps me to go to sleep thinking of the victims we've saved.
we don't always beat the monsters to the babies but we do enough to make the job worth it keep the nightmares bearable.
Ken, go home.
Sandra, wait.
what?
just talk to me for a second, ok?
I can't.
please?
fine.
what?
I just want to know where you're going.
it's none of your business. - Why?
because I'm not your girlfriend.
what, are you too good for me now?
I gotta go.
that's him?
Ken, don't!
Ken, stop!
Ken, don't!
who the hell are you?
Oh, my god.
what are you doing? That's my ex-boyfriend.
get in.
Oh, no, please!
good morning, Emily.
have a good weekend?
Yeah. No.
Yes.
Oh, I've been there.
no, it wasn't
I don't want to get into it.
no problem.
it--it just feels weird for me to talk about my personal life here, you know?
I don't really know you guys all that well yet.
I totally get that.
I think I totally screwed up this date.
OK. What happened?
you have to understand, I'm a nerd.
like, seriously.
and I can fool people for days, weeks even.
but sooner or later, I blow my cover and I say something so geeky.
and then he doesn't respond, and I lose all confidence.
what did you say?
kilgore trout.
guy has a problem with kurt vonnegut?
you know kilgore trout?
I read slaughterhouse-five when I was 12 and it blew my mind.
seriously, I couldn't get enough. So I just kept going and I read 'em all.
Yeah, yeah. Me, too.
what's your favorite? - Oh, mother night.
the one about the American spy.
who pretends to be a nazi.
you are who you pretend to be.
so be careful who you pretend to be.
Oh, my god. I can't believe you're a vonnegut fan.
you just made my day.
anytime.
conference room in 5 minutes, please?
got it.
Sandra davis, 16 years old.
this is her singing at her high school talent show a month ago.
this is her on-again, off-again boyfriend ken Newcombe.
their bodies were found in a park near the male victim's car in Groton, an affluent, mostly white suburb of New York city in westchester county.
it's the third of 3 killings believed to be a series of hate crimes.
hate crimes?
the first 2 victims were keisha Andrews, 15, and Vickie Williams, 17.
they disappeared from their homes in central westchester one night.
their bodies were found in a wooded area in a southern part of the county near the city.
and this was painted on their faces.
what about this couple?
how were their bodies found?
another swastika.
this one on the boyfriend's car.
it's a different victimology.
maybe just an escalation.
or a different killer.
and it doesn't end there.
yesterday an African-American community leader, a reverend Williams, decided to take this on as a political issue.
racial hate in the suburbs.
what we are seeing is pure apathy.
black kids are getting killed and the police are doing nothing to stop it.
when will these racists be confronted?
apparently, in response to reverend williams' muckraking, a black kid was beaten on the streets of Groton this afternoon.
connecticut neo-nazi group called the white stallions claimed responsibility.
there are Neo-Nazi groups in connecticut?
the mayor of Groton called me this morning, frantic.
he's desperate to solve these crimes before it escalates even more.
what are the racial demographics of Groton?
population 42, 000.
8% black.
I'd say the mayor has reason to be worried.
if it doesn't stop soon, it could flare up into a full-scale race riot.
often come the deadliest hate.
Socrates.
new York, New York.
too bad we're flying right past it, straight to the suburbs.
Hey, this is weird.
uh, there are traces of G. H.B.found in the first 2 victims, but no sign of sexual assault.
why would the unsub use a date-rape drug to commit a hate crime?
maybe he wants to weaken them so they can't fight back.
but there was no G. H.B. In the victims of the double homicide.
there's a lot that's different about the double homicide.
the question is why.
all right, we just got new information.
a few weeks before the murder of Sandra Davis and ken Newcombe, a threatening letter was delivered to sandra Davis' door.
she showed it to her parents, who then notified the police.
the police never figured out who wrote it.
we see ken with you and it makes us sick.
take care to stop this now, or you will pay.
if you tell anyone about this, you will pay.
strange. Doesn't seem real. - What do you mean?
first of all, the use of "we" in a threat this direct is almost always bogus.
one individual trying to diffuse responsibility.
also, the message itself seems contradictory.
on the one hand,"take care to stop this now, or you will pay"?
presumably, they want them to stop seeing each other.
but then, on the other hand, they don't want them to go public with it.
if you tell anyone about this, you will pay.
the point of hate crimes is to increase publicity, not decrease it.
it's like terrorism.
an effective threat let's everybody know that they're in danger if they do this behavior.
the author would want Sandra to tell people about the note.
doesn't sound like a guy who's actually prepared to kill.
actually, it. doesn't sound like a guy at all.
take care to "stop this" implies empathy.
"take care"?
males don't use this type of language, especially when they're trained to threaten somebody.
this message is certainly written by a female, and based on the lack of psychological sophistication,
I'd say it's most likely an adolescent.
you think a girl killed these kids?
I think a girl wrote this note.
let's call that mystery number one.
you got a number 2?
maybe.
says here the autopsy on Sandra Davis was inconclusive.
she suffered blunt force trauma to the face, she had some bruising around her neck.
cause of death is still unclear. Coroner's working on it.
a lot of questions.
let's get started on some answers.
agent Jareau, Gregory Hughes.
mayor Hughes. - Yes.
this is detective Rick Ware from the state police department.
we haven't had a murder here in 2 years, you understand.
this was way above our heads.
so we put Rick in charge.
these are agents Gideon, Hotchner, Morgan, and Prentiss.
I have to say that what's been happening here the last few weeks is
it's just hard to fathom.
I mean, we're 30 minutes from the city.
what do you mean?
well, this isn't the deep south.
for the most part, these are sophisticated New Yorkers.
are you saying you don't think this is a race issue?
all we're saying is whatever happened here is way out of the norm for this community.
I wouldn't want you entering this investigation under assumptions that
well, aren't true.
fact is, we don't know what this is about yet.
we need to concentrate on the double murder and make sure that it's the same killer, first of all.
you mean there could be more than one?
we don't know that yet.
all we do know is the threat sent to Sandra Davis was written by an adolescent girl.
you can tell that just from a half a page note?
it's pretty straightforward profiling.
is there a problem, officer?
uh, there was a girl that we suspected at first, but then we talked to her and dismissed her.
I'd like to meet her.
I think it's a waste of time.
I'd like to decide that for myself.
Sandra showed us the note 2 weeks before she was killed.
we asked around the school for who might have a grudge against Sandra and Ken.
the only girl's name that came up was Tonya Mathis.
rumor was ken dumped her for Sandra, although ken told me Tonya was never his girlfriend.
you said you talked to tonya about the note. What'd she say?
she swore up and down she had nothing to do with it.
I find it pretty hard to believe she'd write a racist note.
Why's that?
see for yourself.
that's Tonya?
in the flesh.
leave her in there for a few minutes.
you're gonna make a 17-year-old girl sweat?
I want to scare the hell out of her.
did these kids live near here?
Sandra Davis lived about 1/2 mile west.
Ken Newcombe about a mile east.
what were they doing here?
when I was a kid, I used to hang out in the park at night, drink beers, hook up with a girl.
maybe, but I don't think these two were out on a date.
why do you say that?
well, as ken was wearing a sweatshirt and tennis shoes, Sandra was wearing a dress, high heels, and makeup.
she was definitely dressed to go out.
Ken's body was found here?
Yeah. And sandra here.
but from the bloodstains, it was obvious that she was killed there and then dragged here.
so the unsub shot ken first, Sandra started to run and he chased her down.
beat her and strangled her.
he had a gun, why didn't he shoot her, too?
he could overpower her, maybe he didn't think he could overpower ken.
no, it's more than that.
the killer took the time and risked her escaping to track her down and strangle her with his bare hands.
he was completely focused on her.
Sandra didn't have a date with ken.
she had a date with the unsub.
Hello, Tonya. I'm agent Morgan, this is agent Prentiss.
we're with the F. B.I.
I'm gonna get right to the point.
writing a threat like this?
it's a federal crime.
I told him I didn't write that note.
Oh, I know what you told him.
but this is not the principal's office, you understand?
the people you threatened are dead.
I didn't kill anybody.
I know that.
I got it.
but we need to know why you wrote that note.
you were angry with ken because he didn't acknowledge you.
I get it.
he didn't admit that you were his girlfriend.
I was his girlfriend. - Yeah.
what about Sandra?
she's the one who got the note.
why were you so angry with her, Tonya?
Oh, this isn't just about her going with ken, is it, tonya?
that note says "we."
you wanted to make it look like other people were in on it.
like the whole town was against her. Why?
is that the way she made you feel?
like everybody was against you?
it was that stupid talent show.
what talent show?
I was just as good as her.
she was just this quiet little girl who nobody liked.
then she sings, and suddenly she's all little miss popular, and ken's all over her.
it's not fair.
so, Tonya.
look at me.
you wrote this note for revenge, didn't you?
I know it was stupid.
but I just wanted to scare them.
I'm sorry.
we called tonya's family and friends. We're checking her out, but
that girl didn't kill those kids.
it's how you've had to learn.
anybody seen Reid? Where's Reid?
coroner's report.
victim had been beaten so extensively,
the cause of death was indeterminate.
post-mortem stab wounds were also discovered.
post-mortem stabs, huh?
what?
post-mortem stab wounds almost always indicate sexual homicide.
uh, this is also a fairly extreme overkill, which is markedly different from the other 2 girls.
so you're saying this was a different killer.
no, we're saying if it was the same killer, the overkill indicates he didn't get what he wanted from someone
what you want
sexual predators kill for sexual needs.
and in this case, there's no sign of sexual assault on his victims.
that tells us that he probably fetishises.
takes some souvenir from his victims that he uses to get off.
correct me if I'm wrong, but it doesn't sound like the M. O.Of a hate crime.
no, we're pretty certain that hate wasn't the primary motive at all.
he has a specific physical type and he tries to cover his tracks.
he is a serial killer.
Hi, Naomi.
it's nice to see you again.
hop in.
Thanks.
thanks for picking me up.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
and when did the F. B.I. Finally arrive?
only after a white boy was killed.
we cannot rely on the police.
we must protect ourselves.
let the people who are taking our daughters know they will not get away with this.
that's enough.
explain this to me.
the swastikas on the bodies.
what do they mean?
they're a distraction.
perhaps this killer isn't driven by hate, but he wants us to think so so we won't guess his real motive, which is serial sexual homicide.
I'm confident the unsub's from this county.
he knew the kind of hysteria that would flare up from these swastikas.
Reverend Williams took the bait.
judge is trying to buy us some time.
she's talking to the reverend to see if he'll cool his rhetoric a little bit.
hate crimes are political.
if we're right, this was personal.
well, we need to confirm that the double homicide is linked to the first 2 murders.
we need to speak to the families of the victims.
we know how difficult this is for you.
thanks for talking to us.
she just disappeared that night.
I know she must have just walked out the front door, but I thought we'd hear that.
what about the window in your daughter's bedroom?
she couldn't have climbed out there.
it's been painted shut for years.
no, it hasn't.
what are you talking about, Bree?
I fixed it so I could get out.
you've been sneaking out in the middle of the night?
I'm sorry.
you're not in trouble.
but just tell me, did she sneak out before?
no, I swear.
she always told me not to do it.
she was the good one.
she didn't deserve this.
nobody deserves this.
your daughter liked to sing?
we dug up everything on the first 2 victims, and basically these girls were good students who stayed out of trouble.
just like Sandra Davis.
and we found something else. They both liked to sing.
one in church, and one in a band.
their parents said that this was their passion.
just like Sandra Davis.
african-american girls between the ages of 15 and 17 who like to sing?
that's a pretty specific type.
sounds like the same unsub to me.
and the fact that they all sing, that could be part of his M. O.
maybe part of a ruse.
another girl went missing.
a naomi dade. 16 years old.
when? - Last night.
why are we just finding out about it now?
first victims weren't found for a couple of days, there's a chance she's still alive.
let's get to the profile before it's too late.
Hey, I'm Naomi...
suspect we're looking for is a black male, statistically between the ages of 20 and 35.
we know he's black because of his victims.
sexually motivated killers almost always kill within their own race.
the victims he's chosen are good girls.
they're good students.
no behavioral problems.
they're what we call "low-risk."
and the lower the risk of the victim, the higher the intelligence of the unsub.
guy's a smooth talker.
makes people feel at ease. Gains their confidence.
you'd be amazed what these guys can talk people into.
jeffrey Dahmer was once pulled over by police officers for driving over the center line.
he'd thrown the garbage bag full of body parts in the back seat of his car, but he was so calm and so self assured, that he convinced the officers not to look in the bag.
he then went on to kill at least 15 more people.
this guy's a hustler.
he may not have a lot of education, but he knows how to treat impressionable young girls.
Victor Paleologus used to troll shopping malls pretending to be a movie producer.
he told kristine Johnson he could get her an audition for a James Bond movie.
and that was the last time she was ever seen alive.
we think that because all these girls are singers, that the unsub may be connected in some way to the recording industry.
we know the unsub has a vehicle.
big enough to transport a body.
it's clean. It's not too old.
nice enough to make a girl feel comfortable inside, but it's not flashy.
this is not a guy who wants to attract attention to himself.
probably a large, dark sedan.
we recommend putting this profile on the news, the paper, anywhere it might be seen by the people in this town.
this guy's ruse didn't work on everybody.
somewhere out there is at least one woman who didn't fall for his game, and.
that's who we need to find.
the key to this unsub's psychology is the souvenir he takes.
we don't know what it is yet, but.
we know that once he has it, his victim tn becomes disposable, and that's when he kills her.
the unsub's ritual was interrupted when he killed Sandra Davis.
we don't believe he was able to take a souvenir from her.
we think he may revisit her house or any place she may have frequented.
we recommend surveillance in locations where the unsub might approach young girls.
churches, high schools, libraries, coffee shops.
stick with the community.
the people of this county should be able to offer some good leads.
thanks a lot. Good luck.
you think community vigilance will be enough?
if it were, we'd be out of a job.
I'm telling you not to do your job. - Jason.
just want to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves.
what's he doing?
so please just sit tight one more minute.
what's the problem?
well, the problem is I would have to be crazy to release this profile to the public.
what are you talking about?
Reverend Williams has already stirred up enough trouble by choosing to make this town a soapbox for his anti-racism campaign.
what do you think is gonna happen if I go to the press and tell them the killer is black?
the best way to stop all this is to find that killer.
and we just gave you the best way to do that. Right.
by telling everybody to look out for an anonymous black man?
they're gonna say that's racial profiling.
it's not racial profiling.
racial profiling is targeting suspects because of their race.
we gave you a complete profile which includes race.
the point is I've never even heard of a black serial killer.
and neither have all the African-Americans in this community already upset by what's been happening here.
you can believe in black serial killers or not, but the fact is they do exist.
and it's only a matter of time before he kills another girl.
all right, look. I am not interested in debating this.
detective Ware is more than capable of heading this investigation.
you gonna let this happen?
let what happen?
make every black man in this county a target?
Rick. - What?
we found Naomi Dade's body.
damn it.
we got a mass of reporters out there.
what's it gonna be, detective?
please.
let us help you.
finally, I want to assure you we considered all options, and we're certain this is the best course of action.
thank you.
detective, I think you made the right choice.
I hope this doesn't come back to bite us in the ass.
why would it? - Why?
last thing I need is to spread fear that a dangerous black man running around this county.
best way to solve your problem is to stay focused on what we need to do to catch this guy.
tell me.
tell me what to do.
we need to get the word out-- not just on the news.
we need to talk to these kids face to face.
gotta give them the profile.
what about the talent show that Sandra Davis sang in at her high school, that could be where the unsub saw her sing.
that's a good idea. Talk to the kids at her high school.
set up a tip line.
Yeah, you got it.
well, I hate waiting around. So, what do you say, Ware?
want to join the patrols?
get back on the street? Pretend to be a beat cop again?
beats waiting around here for more bodies, don't it?
let's do it.
tips have just started to come in.
so far, we have fingers pointed at a minister.
you don't have to do this.
a janitor at his school, and.
the reverend Jesse Jackson.
is anything useful?
not so much.
keep diggin'.
I got someone who remembers seeing a black guy they didn't recognize driving around in a black lincoln in front of our last victim's house yesterday.
that's the second sighting for that vehicle.
it fits the profile-- large, dark sedan.
include it in the press release.
Yeah, I got it.
suspect may be driving a black town car.
may be?
it's something.
no, I'm good.
for what it's worth, um.
took balls to stand up to the mayor like that.
you would've done the same thing.
I don't have to work for the guy.
I know that was a tough decision.
don't you ever wish it didn't matter?
it?
color.
judge me by the content of my character.
I mean, why does it even have to be part of the equation?
people are dying. We need to get the bad guy.
no half-cocked reverends running around, getting people mad about the wrong thing.
no mayors so afraid of offending black folks, he doesn't even want to tell the community what to look out for.
it's exhausting sometimes.
it's the way it's always been, man.
politicians, community leaders-- they do what they do.
you and me-- we do what we do.
we're the foot soldiers in these streets getting the job done.
foot soldiers.
right.
only ones who ever really get results, you know what I'm sayin'?
right there.
it's a black town car.
Yeah, just a few blocks from Sandra Davis' house.
he's turning right.
turn right here.
there it is.
you hear that? - Yeah.
nothing - got it
it's a false alarm. It's just a car service.
all right. I'll be right out.
I got him! I got him!
what the hell are you doing?
Freeze!
put down your weapon.
the cops, damn it.
I'm F. B.I.
what?
listen to me. Do not shoot.
I'm gonna reach in my back pocket and grab my wallet.
all right? All right?
I'm F. B.I.Man.
I didn't know.
give me your gun.
give me your gun! Call 9-1-1.
this man needs help.
go! Call 9-1-1!
ware, nah, nah, nah.
come on, man.
look at me. Look at me.
ware, you're going to be all right.
I'll get you some help, Ware.
talk to me. Hey, just talk to me. I'm right here.
tell me about that family of yours.
you got 2 kids, right?
I saw those pictures in your car.
what's your little one's name?
Dwayne. All right, that's good.
that's good. Come on.
I got you, man. You ain't going nowhere.
all right? All right?
tell me about Dwayne?
how old is he?
come on. Ware, talk to me. Say it.
don't you leave me. No. Come on.
don't you do this. Ware!
Ware! No. Come on, man.
what the hell happened?
I didn't know he was a cop.
w-we saw this black car parked in front of our house.
this black guy with a gun sneaking around the yard.
so, you shot him?
I--I was scared.
I got a family.
so did detective Ware.
Where's Morgan? - Back here.
you ok?
Yeah, J.J.
you're kidding.
another girl just went missing.
all right, we're on our way.
the girl's name is Ally Hadley.
she told her mom she was sleeping over at a friend's house, but she never showed up there.
well, I'm sure she's just out with some other friends or a guy or
she says she never does this. She a
good girl.
she's African-American. 15 years old.
she loves to sing.
guys we got a witness.
a girl who saw the report on the news.
she says a guy came up to her about a month ago, claiming to work for a record company.
she's on the way in.
I'll call the others.
it was after choir practice at the church.
he came up to me outside
this black guy.
told me he was an executive at some record company and he goes to churches in the area to scout talent.
he said I had a great voice, and he'd like to record me.
what did you say?
I told him I wasn't interested.
he gave me some kind of business card and told me to call him if I changed my mind.
it didn't even have a company name on it
just his name and a phone number.
it looked so fake. How could anyone fall for that?
do you have the card?
I didn't have to keep the card.
Why?
I knew him.
I was beginning to think you guys had forgotten all about me.
well, we need you now more than ever, hot stuff.
Aww, it's like candy to my ears, sugar. Go.
all right, here's the scoop. The guy's a freelance musician.
played keyboard for the girls' high school musical.
we contacted the school, and they gave us a name
in the New York metropolitan area including Westchester county.
computer says 3.
he may work at a recording studio or record company.
OK, I'm going to cross reference with I. R.S.
records.
gotcha.
mount vernon, just outside the bronx. A & l studios
looks like they went bellyup a few months ago.
but he still works there as a security guard.
Thanks, mama. You're the best.
let's go.
you're lucky the studio was available tonight.
you're not nervous, are you, Ally?
no.
good. Good. Don't you worry.
I'll have you back before your parents even know you're gone.
Hey. Let's go.
all units to A & L studios, 5663 vincent boulevard.
what are the chances of us catching this psycho in time?
Oh, that was it.
you killed that last take!
I'll--I'll be right out.
I've never been in a real recording studio before.
well, you wouldn't know it.
I mean, you're so comfortable.
it sounded like you were in your own living room singing.
it felt good.
Hey, I'm sorry. Your--your throat must be tired.
you want some water?
sure.
Hey, our road's closed. Construction.
isn't there a faster way?
not that I know of. No.
Hey, you know not a lot of girls your age would have chosen a song like this.
Really? - Oh, yeah.
and that look-- that face you got.
I mean, you got this real smokey kind of tone.
like something you hear in a thirties harlem supper club.
I mean, do you have any idea what your music does to me.
no.
it takes hold.
you get a song stuck in your head.
but for me, it gets stuck right here.
once it's there, There's just no letting it go.
it's just...
you all right?
just... a little dizzy.
what I'm saying is that it's so beautiful.
ally, I just can't
let it live.
you ever feel that? Like there's something so beautiful
so beautiful you can't let it live to show you
to remind you of how ugly you are?
I--I don't feel so good.
son of a bitch!
you think I'm ugly?
help!
somebody help!
I'll cover the door.
right there. Go.
check the back.
door are we open, lights are on.
somebody left in a hurry.
there was definitely a struggle.
so, maybe she's still alive.
they were here. And maybe she tried to flee.
she could be in the neighborhood, trying to get away.
Hotch, look at this.
it's the voices, man, his souvenirs.
let's go.
that's your pro.
help me.
what's the matter?
Where--where am I?
what did you take?
ally! Ally, there you are!
you know this girl?
thank you, officer. This is my baby cousin.
her parents are out of town, and I'm taking care of her right now.
and, uh, she snuck out and obviously got herself some kind of wasted.
I'm very, very sorry.
come on, Ally.
come on. Party's over.
you want me to tell your parents what you've done?
I mean, look around you. This is a dangerous neighborhood, Ally.
you could have gotten yourself killed.
you know this man?
again, officer, I'm very, very sorry.
she's--she's really out of it.
come on, Ally, you can sleep it off when you get home.
can I go now?
or am I gonna have to stand here all night while you mess with this kid?
there they are.
Wakeland, F.B. I!
don't move!
whats going on? - Let her go.
what did I do?
let her go.
I know you think this is about those murdered girls, right?
right?
he won't let her go. - He could be armed.
just calm down! - Hey, what the hell are you waiting for?
do not shoot!
I want you to calm down, put your weapons down so we can move in.
do it!
do it!
Wakeland, get away from the girl.
turn around.
hands on your head.
let's go.
you all right?
I was just thinking.
I know what it's like to grow up without a father.
their father died a hero.
so did mine.
doesn't make it any easier.
the life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living.
Cicero.
sorry.
Oh, wait a minute.
no, you didn't.
where did you find this?
in the airport. Can you believe it?
haven't read this in fift--like--12 years.
OK, that's funny.
chapter 3's where it starts to get good.
OK. I will let you know when I get there.
all right, you do that.
you all right?
I said, are you all right?
I'm fine.
thanks for broadcasting it.
Hey, talk to me.
whatever you say to me in confidence is between us. You know that right?
I don't have anything to tell you.
Reid, listen to me.
what you went through out there, nobody expects you to rebound
I can still do my job, all right. I'm not gonna freak out.
you think I don't know that.
it's the crime scene photos.
crime scene photos?
the dead girls in the leaves.
Reid, we've seen worse.
I know.
I know we've seen worse, but.
for the first time, I know.
I look at them, and.
I look at them and I
I know what they were thinking.
and I know what they were feeling, like, right before.
that's called empathy.
and it's a good thing.
it's not. It's got me all messed up.
I don't know how to focus.
I can't do my job as well.
so, what do I do?
you use it.
let it make you a better profiler,
a better person.
a better person.
he came after me. He came to my home.
Sarah's dead. He butchered her.
your team is in trouble.
did you fly a disturbed college student to meet with a man you believed to be a serial killer?
it was my decision.
give me your badge.
you're suspended for 2 weeks pending an investigation.
there's no satisfactory explanation what I've done.
I just don't understand it any of it anymore.
what are you doing here?
Gideon didn't answer his phone.
I called him twice.
have you been here all night?
we were supposed to play chess.
here?
uh, he hasn't been back to his apartment since, um...
right.
I need to brief the team, so...
is Hotch here?
uh, he's not due for a half hour.
Thanks, honey. - Yeah.
are you sure you're ok?
Yeah, I'm fine.
you're doing the right thing.
I know.
getting suspended was a blessing in disguise.
we deserve a normal life.
I love you. - I love you, too.
what, no Hotch, now no Gideon?
no, not yet.
these guys have been out 2 weeks.
you'd think the least they could do is be on time.
Yeah, because you're never late.
so where's Prentiss?
her phone keeps going straight to voicemail.
well, this room just keeps getting smaller and smaller, doesn't it?
should we wait 15 minutes?
we can just brief them on the plane.
right now the police taskforce in Milwaukee needs our help.
they've had 4 murders over the past 3 weeks, and in addition, another woman has been missing the last 2 days.
they've all the women are in their 30s, married with children.
any connection between these victims?
just that they've all been abducted from the area of Wauwatosa, all from very public places, but there's no witnesses.
how are we even certain it's the same killer?
well, for starters...
all of the bodies have been dumped in the city's third ward.
and there's this.
is that what I think it is?
all the hearts have been cut from their bodies.
george Washington said: let your heart feel for the affliction and distress of everyone.
Hey, am I glad to see you.
where you headed?
milwaukee. Looks like another one.
I'll catch you up on the flight.
I'm meeting with the section chief.
OK, so I'll wait.
I'm just glad you're back.
trust me when I tell you things have been a little bit shaky around here.
Morgan, I'm requesting a transfer.
is that a joke?
no, it's not a joke.
Strauss has suspended me once already. The writing's on the wall.
Hotch, we both know that suspension was bogus.
you'll get a new unit chief.
what if we don't want a new unit chief?
well, maybe the next one won't be such a drill sergeant.
look, man, are you a pain in my ass? Yes, sir.
but wanting to hang out with you and needing you to lead this team are two very different things.
it's been a privilege.
I was hoping you'd do the right thing.
have you given any thought to what department you'll request?
I was under the impression that if I left the B. A.U. I'd have my choice of posts.
well, I'll consider it after I fully complete my investigation.
you were a prosecutor.
what about heading up a white collar crime taskforce?
that'll get you home at nights at a reasonable hour.
sorry to interrupt.
sir, I've decided to resign from the FBI, effective immediately.
I don't understand.
I'm taking a foreign service exam.
with my connections, I stand a good chance of landing in the state department.
Prentiss, I think that's a mistake.
well, don't try to talk me out of it.
Garcia saw my name on the list and she already tried.
if she can't talk someone out of doing something, no one can.
sorry for the interruption.
but, sir, it's good to see you back.
the team needs you. Ma'am.
I'll be overseeing this case until I can assign a replacement.
you don't have any field experience.
my job is to protect the bureau.
if I have to hold the team's hand for one case, so be it.
ma'am, in order to function effectively, this team needs stability.
the B. A.U. Has some very talented people and they're bureau assets.
and I believe it's time that they were out from underneath you and Jason Gideon.
you know, from this angle, she almost looks human.
has anyone talked to Emily yet?
she was gone before I heard the news.
I told you, Reid, now we're down 2 agents and Gideon's M. I.A.
doesn't Strauss ever do any......
correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it's protocol to brief everyone before we arrive at the crime scene.
Yes, ma'am.
this unsub is abducting women from very public places, with no witnesses.
he holds them 48 hours, with no sexual assault, and then he dumps their bodies with their hearts carved out of their chests.
there's an obvious dichotomy in the skill the unsub exhibits in abducting these women and the fact that he cuts their hearts out so crudely.
we're probably looking at someone in a psychotic break.
could be a butcher. Might be a hunter.
somebody who's very comfortable being around blood, but as you can see, he obviously doesn't have the skills of a surgeon.
so do we have a working theory?
sure we do.
somebody really doesn't like women.
is it appropriate to ask whether I could talk you out of it?
heard you got a bigger office.
a swanky new map and everything.
it's the Milwaukee file.
J. J. wanted me to give it to you.
I'm not working it.
I'm just following orders.
they found a new body this morning.
the others are headed straight to the scene.
you the FBI?
Spencer Reid, Jennifer Jareau, and section chief Strauss.
vic Wolynski, Milwaukee pd.
you worked the Jeffrey Dahmer case.
16 years ago. I've studied it.
and you remember my name?
he remembers everything.
it what he does.
what can you tell us?
uh, local merchant noticed her a few hours ago.
uh, but considering he didn't see her when he first came to work, uh, we figure she was dumped there between 7: 50 and 8: 05.
same window as the others.
all the bodies were found in this area, right?
uh, Wauwatosa is an upper-middle-class suburb approximately 15 minutes from here.
all the women were abducted from there in the afternoon and turned up here in the morning 2 days later.
all this foot traffic and no one saw anything.
well, he, up, wraps the bodies, uh, loosely so they're not immediately recognizable.
eventually the, uh, wrapping comes open my guess is he, uh, has a van or a truck, something he can back up so he's shielded when he makes the drop.
no prints on whatever he wraps them in?
there have been traces of paint and wood stain, but most of it is just common stuff you'd get at any hardware store.
he's trying to demean them, putting them out like trash.
this guy might work or live around here.
gets off on the reaction to his... handiwork.
what can you tell us about the victim?
she was taken from a supermarket.
her husband says that most days she would have been picking up her son at school, but he was spending the afternoon at a friend's.
this is your fifth victim, right? - Yes.
you should have called us sooner.
I thought we had a handle on it.
apparently not. - Ma'am.
excuse me, sir.
we need to work with these detectives.
I'm sorry?
we don't generally criticize them.
it just really doesn't get us anything.
are you saying it wouldn't be helpful if he had contacted us sooner?
well, of course.
it's always, you know, the sooner the better. - Right.
and agent Jareau...
don't question me again.
is Jack still napping?
I thought this was over.
it is. I'm just curious.
Hello?
Hello?
what did the section chief say?
she suggested that I transfer to a white collar crime taskforce.
would you have to travel?
no, I'd have a 9: 00 to 5: 00 life.
then it's a no-brainer.
Hey. - How's it going?
well, Strauss just offended the lead detective 45 seconds into her first crime scene.
I'm not surprised.
this isn't about to get any better, is it?
I doubt it.
Morgan, listen, I've been looking at the file.
milwaukee schools start at 8: 10 and they get out at 3: 10.
every abduction has taken place within 15 minutes of school getting out.
and each body was dumped within 15 minutes of the first bell.
we could easily be looking at somebody who works in the school system.
OK. Thanks, man.
any idea how's he's getting control of these women? Is he blitzing them or coercing them?
so far we're coming up blank. - Ok.
keep me posted.
you scared me.
I'm looking for my dad.
are you lost? - I'm not lost.
I'm just not sure where I am.
OK. Maybe I can help you?
are you sure this is what your dad said?
he said if anything happened, to meet him on the side because it wouldn't be so crowded.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, there you are.
Hey, guy, I was worried.
Hi. - Hi.
I'm sorry I tricked you. My dad's just shy.
I want you to smile and ask if you can come home with us, or I'm gonna gut the boy like a deer.
would you mind if I came home with you?
I'd like that.
well, then.
Hey. What do we know?
woman's name is Claire Thompson.
husband tried to reach her on the cell phone.
when she didn't pick up, he drove to the department store.
car's in the parking lot, but she's not inside.
is that the husband? - Yeah.
J. J.Take Strauss with you.
I had the department store uplink the security footage to your analyst in Quantico. - Perfect
my desk is over here.
Garcia, baby girl, please tell me something I want to hear.
you're a statuesque god of sculpted chocolate thunder.
how about something I don't already know?
I have a sweet tooth?
did you locate the missing girl on the security footage?
on it. It's coming your way in 5, 4,3, 2...
I got it.
keep me on speaker, will you?
she doesn't seem to be on anyone's radar.
look. Who's the kid?
does Claire Thompson have a son?
no. 2 - year - old daughter.
it looks like the kid's lost.
Garcia, this all you got? - That's it.
they turn down a hallway without no security camera and we lose them.
I'll get a list of missing kids, see if we can make out a resemblance to any of them.
Oh, damn. - What?
something Hotch said.
all the abductions and disposals have been timed around school.
we thought the unsub might work in the system.
what if this guy's actually using his own son to lure his victims?
detective Wolynski told us you're trying to single out trucks and vans.
that's smart.
the unsub is dumping his victims in the business district, so I'd agree with you
he's probably not driving something that would stand out.
he may even have some type of company logo on the side of his vehicle as well.
we know that he abducts the women in Wauwatosa and dumps their bodies somewhere in the third ward.
most unsubs keep their area of control-- where they kill their victims
triangulated between the two points.
which means that the unsub probably lives in Wauwatosa or the third ward.
somewhere in that area.
and the people who live there know the unsub.
there's no sexual component to these crimes, which means it's more about the unsub making a point.
he's cutting their hearts out.
it might just be that this is the sickest way the unsub knows to disfigure the women and...
throw them out like trash. We can't really know.
the two most important questions to ask ourselves are:
what is this guy doing with these women for 48 hours?
and why is he willing to use his own son to abduct them?
and if he is truly using his own son, then it's likely that he has what we call borderline personality disorder.
now, borderlines-- they think that all relationships revolve entirely around them.
when they set their mind to something, absolute-- there is no gray area.
it would also manifest in a way that would be visible to people around the unsub.
intense bouts of anger and depression, problems drinking.
he would also be highly sensitive to rejection.
and one last thing.
it is not easy to crack clean into breastbone.
you're dealing with a guy who works with his hands and he's used to hard labor.
at the very least, he's not afraid to get dirty.
now, I'm gonna take that out of your mouth and you're gonna be really quiet.
like a doll. Ok?
Oh, that's good.
let's go on upstairs.
and you're gonna be really, really nice to the boy.
not like the little bitch we all know you are.
you understand?
say it!
I understand.
lovely.
Haley? Ok, mac and cheese. - Got it - Here you go. Good boy. - Hello - Mac and cheese. - Ah, it's the best.
it's Morgan. - Thanks.
Yeah, what's up?
you know I wouldn't be calling you unless I was desperate.
still no Gideon?
no, not a word.
Reid's starting to worry about him.
we really need you out here, man.
Morgan, I've already put in for the transfer. It's a done deal.
no, you didn't. Not yet, anyway.
it's not in the system, Hotch, not yet.
come on. You know this case.
you could pitch in on just this one.
we think he might be using his own kid to lure these women, man.
he just picked up another one.
Hotch. - I got to think.
what are you doing?
multiplication. - Multiplication.
that's hard. - It's extra credit.
the rest of the class is still on long division.
maybe I could help you.
it's ok. - I'm really good at math.
the boy...
has got to learn to do things by himself.
no, of course.
but you can make me a sandwich.
OK. - Come on.
let's go clean up your room.
help!
what the hell are you doing?
keep your voice down.
Gideon didn't show in Milwaukee and the team needs me.
I don't believe this.
don't worry, it won't affect my transfer.
I've been working on an existing case.
you're not working on this case.
I can't just switch off my loyalty, Haley.
they suspended you for 2 weeks.
who are you being loyal to?
the team needs me.
no, they need Gideon.
do you know what this guy's doing to women in Milwaukee? I don't want to know.
he's using his son to lure them, he's holding them, and then he's cutting their hearts out.
aaron, stop!
don't make me the monster here.
I feel sick about these women, but when this case is over, there will be another one.
and another one and another one.
it is never going to stop.
this is who I am.
no...
this is what you do.
I'm trying to do the right thing, here and there, and I would really appreciate a little support.
that's right.
cause you always need to be the hero.
don't give me that. - No.
obviously a happy life isn't enough for you.
I'll be back...as soon as this case is over.
Yeah, well, make sure you give your son a kiss before you leave.
can I come in?
the team needs us. They're working on a case in Milwaukee.
Gideon hasn't shown up, and don't tell me you quit or I put in for a transfer.
you put in for a transfer?
they're both still hung up in the system, so technically we're in dereliction of duty by not being there.
I'm sorry, I can't go.
right. Sorry I barged in.
wait. Wait. Can I ask
why are you really here?
I told you.
I think Strauss came to you and asked for dirt on me.
why would she do that?
I think if you have your eyes on top leadership at the FBI, you want to know who might stand in your way.
and... what could I have told her?
that one of my agents might have murdered a suspect in cold blood.
or another might have a serious drug problem which I didn't report, and if Strauss had any evidence, my career would be over.
I think she put you on our team and expected something in return.
and to your credit, you quit.
rather than whisper in her ear.
I told you.
I hate politics.
come to Milwaukee.
I'll make you a deal.
if your ready bag isn't here, packed, I won't bug you anymore.
if it is, I want you on that plane with me. One more case.
I already turned in my badge and my gun.
that's just hardware.
I have triple patrol in the area and I've got every available unit Recanvassing.
it's tough knowing they're out there and we're still a step behind.
you know, it used to be a running joke that if you told people you were from Milwaukee, all they wanted to talk about was happy day reruns.
and then Dahmer happens and they ask you about it as if it's the same thing.
as if it's entertainment.
but I was in that apartment.
Gideon, one of our bosses, says that there are things that attach to you that...
you can never wash off.
all right, -- is it possible we're looking at this the wrong way?
what do you mean?
well, we're trying to zero in on the unsub.
now, you guys tell me, but...
if he really is using his son, wouldn't the trauma manifest more clearly on the boy?
can your analyst get a list of all the children in the area that we're targeting?
Garcia can get you whatever you want.
talk dirty to me.
I
this is section chief Erin Strauss.
ma'am, I think it goes without saying that I was expecting it to be someone else.
I need a list of every grade school in the third ward and Wauwatosa.
Yes, ma'am.
the third ward has one public grade school, but there appears to be 4 private schools that draw from that area.
and Wauwatosa?
that would be 9, ma'am.
and how many students? - 3200
can you also get me a list of every guidance counselor that deals directly with the student body in that area?
certainly, ma'am.
and again, I'd like to a...
you need to present these counselors with a profile of a troubled kid.
the boy we're looking for is possibly from a single-parent home.
he's sullen and withdrawn.
he may have been caught stealing things from his female teachers.
he's more than likely clinging to maternal figures in inappropriate settings
hugging the female bus driver, the woman in the lunchroom.
his classmates might notice this inappropriate behavior and tease him, which makes the boy incredibly angry.
that many. - I'm afraid so.
well, thank you.
how was school? - Ok.
it was just ok?
is the lady still at home? - Yeah.
is she gonna leave? - I don't know.
I don't want her to.
sometimes things happen. Grown-up things.
I don't want this one to go. - But they
they all leave. Ok?
maybe they all leave because of you. - What?
I know you're old enough to understand this.
I will not always be around!
they all leave. All of them.
they leave, they leave, they leave. Do you understand me?
it's all right.
it's ok, all right?
I'm just trying to teach you something.
all right, the boy doesn't look like he could be any older than 7.
let's work youngest to oldest.
start with the Worbe Sthavior.
get the names of the parents, send them over to Garcia.
she can cross-check for criminal records.
this guy's dumping bodies between 7: 30 and 8: 00. That gives us...
a little over 12 hours to make something hit.
let's get it done. - Look who's here.
Hey. Where do we start?
how fast can you get us up to speed?
how fast can you sit down?
we're only here to help.
we'll deal with this later.
it's impossible. There's too many.
keep looking, Reid. We still have an hour.
thank you, by the way, for giving Garcia that file to give to me.
I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't see Garcia before I left.
did you sleep well? - Yeah.
do you mind if I have some cereal?
I guess not.
he's gonna kill you, you know.
are you all right?
I st--I stepped on her hair.
if you need a second, take a second. This is what it is.
just don't let the public see you break down.
this is a different area from the other dump sites, isn't it?
reid: He's getting smart.
he knows where all of our manpower will be so he's changing locations.
how long before he changes when and where he abducts them?
he does that, we're back at zero.
no, no, no, no. We gotta keep him out of here.
morgan says you're worried about Gideon.
I keep on calling him, he doesn't call back.
he's probably at his cabin. That's where he goes when he...
needs to get away.
Reid, I need your head in this. - I know.
so what's around the dump site?
here's the old printing press of quad graphics, and the paving yard, and then the concrete factory where we found the body.
none of them visible from the highway.
you don't end up there by accident.
so we go back to the schools, we eliminate the third ward, and we target problem kids whose fathers have held blue-collar jobs over the last 10 years.
what if he's not a problem kid? - What?
forget it. It's off the textbook profile.
what is it, Reid?
sometimes when a parent is unstable, especially if the other one's out of the picture, you'll do anything to be the perfect child.
like help your father abducts women?
they're never late for school.
even with the abductions, the disposal of the bodies, it's always timed perfectly so the kid will be on time to school.
I don't think the killer would care. I think the kid would.
FBI. Technical analyst Penelope Garcia speaking.
Garcia, I need a list of parents from the Wauwatosa school district, eliminating any two-parent households or any fathers holding white collar jobs that aren't labor management.
you'll see it flying over the transom momentarily.
and one more thing-- the glitches in the transfers and resignations stop now.
uh-- yes, sir.
and, Garcia... - yes?
thank you.
he's a kid that's a model student.
not just straight as, though.
it's someone who tries to please in a way that the other teachers have probably talked about.
inventing extra-credit projects, volunteering to skip recess to help clean the classroom, stuff like that.
do you know his father?
Oh, it's such a sad story.
the teachers all talk about it.
he was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor 6 months ago, and his wife left the two of them.
she just left?
Yeah. I don't know what's gonna happen to David.
thank you for driving me.
you know, I can't just leave you here.
I have to make sure your dad's home.
I know.
I can't imagine David's father being someone you're looking for.
he's very involved.
he drops David off and picks him up every day.
do you happen to know what kind of car he drives?
a van, maybe?
I can't say. Something big.
he makes hand-crafted furniture.
I know he does deliveries.
miss Bennett. - Just continue working.
we're looking for David Smith.
you just missed him.
do you know where he went?
he wasn't feeling well, so the nurse volunteered to drive him home to help out David's father.
thank you.
the boy's alone in the family room.
where are your other agents?
covering the other side.
they have an eye-line just in case somebody tries to sneak out the back.
is there any sign of the nurse or the dad?
no.
go ahead, you want to scream, scream.
go ahead and scream!
the school knows that I'm here! - Yes, yes.
you dropped the boy off, I thanked you, and then you left.
they'll find your car in the parking lot of the Mayfair mall.
I was trying to help your son.
so what are we doing here?
we call in S. W.A. T.Secu trehe perimeter, and wait for him to come out.
ma'am, he's holding a woman inside.
we don't know that for certain.
we don't have probable cause.
she's right.
if he's got her, he waits 48 hours.
he's not gonna kill her yet.
he's changed the pattern of the dump sites, and now he's changed how he abducts them.
do we really want to gamble that he's sticking to the rest of the model?
so let's pound on the door.
maybe he'll panic.
but he could spook just enough to kill her early.
let me go in alone.
the boy's in the family room.
he'll answer the door. - No.
we need to get invited in that door.
he's looking for female authority figures.
if he lets me in, I can signal as soon as I see anything that gives us cause.
technically, you're not even in the FBI.
all the better.
she's interfering with a federal investigation.
well, if I'm no longer in the FBI, then you have no authority over me.
I'm just a civilian knocking on a little boy's door.
Prentiss. - Thank you - As soon as you have probable cause, give us a signal and get out of there. - Ok.
everybody knows what we need to make this arrest legal.
Hi.
are you David?
your dad asked me to come by.
he's busy.
would it be ok if i came in and waited?
I guess.
thank you.
my dad says it's unsafe to leave your door unlocked.
smart man.
Prentiss is in. We're waiting on her go.
so...
where is your dad?
he's working in there.
is he alone would it be ok if I just let him know I was waiting?
he doesn't like me to go down there when he's working.
Oh, no, you don't have to.
um, I just gonna go and see if he's too busy.
and we can both be really quiet, ok? Can you be quiet?
who is this?
where did she come from?
she said she knew you. - What?
she said she knew you.
I can't.
take it.
it's ok. Just...
no.
point it right here.
right thing
let's go!
drop the weapon, son.
give me the gun.
here.
that's ok.
do what they say.
are you ok?
Ah,I'll be fine.
you're dying, and this is what you want to leave your son?
how's your head?
I'll live.
is it weird I'm glad to be back?
I'll make sure it stays official.
I'll be dead before I ever stand trial. - Good.
you know, I never even told the boy to bring me this last one.
how's she doing?
she's gonna be ok.
you know, I can't officially approve of how this transpired, right? - No.
the arrest was clean.
it would be a mistake to break up this team.
none of you will ever move up the chain of command. You know that.
why would I ever want to leave the B. A.U.
you mean that? You're not gonna leave us?
I don't know. I gotta talk to Haley.
Spencer, I knew it would be you who came to the cabin to check on me.
I'm sorry the explanation couldn't be better.
and I'm sorry it doesn't make more sense.
but I've already told you, I just don't understand any of it anymore.
you get enough to eat, honey?
Oh, yeah.
you travelin'? - Yeah
where you headed?
nowhere in particular.
how will you know when you get there?
that's a good question...
a very good question.
have a great day. - You too.
I guess I'm just looking for it again.
for the belief I had back in college.
the belief I had when I first met Sarah and it all seemed so right.
the belief in happy endings.
Yeah. A BONE SPUR.
I KNOW! IT'S RIDICULOUS.
a-and TOM WANTS TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY.
did I MENTION THIS?
let's SEE. I-I'M 38 YEARS OLD,
and I HAVE RUNAWAY BONES GROWING OUT OF MY FEET.
pull YOURSELF TOGEER.
I CAN'T STAND TO SEE AN 8-YEAR-OLD CRY.
19? YOU'RE GUESSING AGAIN.
because I DON'T KNOW.
because YOU'RE NOT FOCUSING.
Mm-mmm.
damn IT.
Hey, WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGE IS THAT?
mom SAYS IT ALL THE TIME.
mom IS A GROWN-UP.
I KNOW. I ALWAYS WANTED A GIRL,
but NOW THAT I HAVE 2 BOYS, IT JUST SEEMS
Oh, DAMN IT.
no. I JUST SPILLED SOME WINE.
well, IT'S DOABLE.
I GOT MY WHOLE LIFE AHEAD OF ME, RIGHT?
Hello?
great.
Tom, COULD YOU GET THAT?
I-it's PROBABLY CAROL RETURNING THE DISH FROM THE POTLUCK.
YOU...FOCUS.
Hey. IT JUST RAN OUT IN FRONT OF THE CAR.
is IT YOURS?
Oh, MY GOSH.
uh, NO. WE DON'T HAVE A CAT.
could IT MAYBE BE ONE OF YOUR NEIGHBOR'S?
I DON'T-- I GUESS IT'S POSSIBLE.
is IT DEAD?
Hayden, GO IN THE OTHER ROOM.
well, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A TAG.
Oh, DON'T TOUCH IT. IT MIGHT HAVE A DISEASE.
there's A NUMBER. DO YOU THINK, UH,
maybe I COULD USE YOUR TELEPHONE?
it's NOT WORKING.
what DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT WORKING?
I DON'T KNOW. IT DIED. MAYBE THE BATTERIES.
you CAN USE MY CELL. THANKS.
Hey, THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY NICE CLUBS.
you MUST BE A GOOD PLAYER.
Heh. YEAH, NICE CLUBS, BUT MY GAME IS A WRECK.
that's WEIRD. THERE'S NO SIGNAL.
you GOT A BAG?
a BAG?
like SHE SAID, IT MIGHT HAVE A DISEASE.
Oh. YEAH, SURE. JUST A SECOND.
y-you WANNA STEP IN?
Yeah. THANK YOU.
I DON'T SEE WHY WE HAVE TO GET HIM A BAG.
it's CALLED BEING NEIGHBORLY.
he's NOT OUR NEIGHBOR.
do WE HAVE TO ARGUE ABOUT THIS?
well, EXCUSE ME FOR NOT WANTING A DEAD ANIMAL BROUGHT INTO MY HOUSE.
sorry. MY FRIEND IS A LITTLE SHOOK UP.
he WAS DRIVING WHEN WE, YOU KNOW...
Yeah, SURE.
whoa.
little GUY'S A LOAD.
should MAYBE DOUBLE-BAG IT.
look, GUYS, UH, WE WERE JUST GETTING READY TO EAT.
Oh, A FAMILY DINNER. THAT'S NICE.
come HOME FROM PLAYING GOLF,
have A NICE MEAL, NICE FAMILY.
you're A LUCKY GUY.
Yeah.
uh, SO IF YOU GUYS DON'T MIND...
well, WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THE CAT?
I DON'T KNOW. TAKE IT TO A VET, I GUESS.
what's A VET GONNA DO? IT'S DEAD.
Hey, WHAT KIND OF CLUBS ARE THESE ANYWAY?
uh, GUYS, I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.
we'll CALL THE POLICE.
how YOU GONNA DO THAT?
you COULD YELL, I GUESS.
you HAVE TO BE REAL LOUD, THOUGH.
look, THIS IS RIDICULOUS. YOU GUYS GET OUT
Hey, DON'T TOUCH ME, BITCH!
Hey, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU--AAH!
dad! BOYS, GET IN YOUR ROOM.
no, BOYS.
stay.
the HALBERT FAMILY.
they WERE MURDERED IN THEIR HOME LAST NIGHT IN THE DENVER SUBURB OF CHERRY CREEK.
it's THE THIRD HOME INVASION LIKE THIS IN THE LAST MONTH.
they KILL EVERYONE.
parents, KIDS, PETS IF THEY HAVE THEM.
always FAMILIES, NICE NEIGHBORHOODS.
what DO THEY TAKE?
nothing THEY CAN'T FIT IN THEIR POCKETS
cash, JEWELRY.
hundreds OF WAYS TO GET CASH AND JEWELS
without KILLING ENTIRE FAMILIES.
that's WHY HOME INVASIONS ARE SO HARD TO PROFILE
multiple MOTIVES.
national STATISTICS SHOW AN UPTICK IN HOME INVASIONS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, 18% IN COLORADO.
you KNOW IT'S BAD IF THEY'RE INVITING US BACK.
back?
when A COUPLE OF AGENTS PUBLICLY CRITICIZED LOCAL DETECTIVES.
well, THEY DIDN'T NEED US TO MAKE THEM LOOK BAD.
and THAT WAS IN BOULDER.
Yeah, BUT THE STATEWIDE MEDIA RAN WITH IT,
and IT TOOK ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN.
well, I TALKED TO A LIEUTENANT NELLIS.
trust ME. THEY WANT OUR HELP.
they NEED IT.
the FIRST 2 INVASIONS WERE 20 DAYS APART.
this LAST ONE WAS JUST 9 DAYS LATER.
so THEY'RE KILLING IN FASTER CYCLES, ACQUIRING A TASTE.
and GETTING BETTER AT IT EVERY TIME.
in THE SUBURBS, THOUGH, IT'S INTIMATE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL, "RESISTANT TO GENERALIZATION,"
a MYSTERY OF THE INDIVIDUAL SOUL
Barbara EHRENREICH.
home INVASIONS TYPICALLY INVOLVE
the ELDERLY AND SINGLE FEMALES.
the FACT THAT ENTIRE FAMILIES ARE BEING TARGETED
suggests MULTIPLE UNSUBS.
could MEAN GANG-RELATED,
revenge MOTIVE, PERSONAL BUSINESS.
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THESE VICTIMS
are RUNNING IN GANG CIRCLES.
sewing CIRCLES, MORE LIKE IT.
P. T.A. MOMS, GRAY-FLANNEL DADS
these GUYS ARE KILLING THE CLEAVERS.
strange.
the PATTERN?
no, THE CLEAVERS. OF ALL THE NAMES FOR A 1950s IDYLLIC TV FAMILY,
I MEAN, IT'S RIFE WITH VIOLENT IMPLICATION.
kind OF MAKES YOU WONDER HOW THE WRITERS
really FELT ABOUT SUBURBIA, HUH?
focus, PLEASE.
uh, OK, WHAT ABOUT, UM, CLASS-BASED UPRISING?
there's NO GRAFFITI, NO MESSAGES,
at LEAST NOT VISIBLE ONES. THERE'S NO RITUALS.
manson's AIM WAS TO START A RACWAR.
there's NO PROOF OF ANY HATE CRIME HERE.
the PARENT MURDERS ARE BRUTAL, MESSY.
the INSTRUMENTS VARY. UH, GOLF CLUB,
kitchen KNIFE, IRON.
household IMPLEMENTS, SYMBOLS OF FAMILY.
but THE KIDS WERE DIFFERENT.
they DIED BY INJECTION, PENTOBARBITAL.
it's A BARBITURATE SOMETIMES USED
as AN ANTICONVULSANT FOR EPILEPTICS,
anxiety DISORDERS, AND STATE EXECUTIONS.
the INVASIONS ARE WELL PLANNED.
phone LINES ARE CUT. LIGATURE MARKS SHOW
the PARENTS WERE BOUND AND GAGGED.
look LIKE THESE GUYS HAD SOME ROBBERY EXPERIENCE.
and THEN FOUND THEIR TRUE CALLING.
no SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY.
same AS THE OTHER 2 HOUSES, RIGHT?
Yeah.
so IT'S LATE, AND THE DOORBELL RINGS.
I COME OVER,
and I FLIP THE SWITCH.
huh.
they MADE IT DARK.
no ONE SEES ANYTHING IF THEY'RE WALKING BY.
but I CAN STILL SEE THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE.
if YOU LOOK LIKE TROUBLE, I MIGHT NOT LET YOU IN...
but IF YOU LOOK NONTHREATENING, MAYBE I OPEN UP.
so THE OCCUPANTS EITHER KNEW THEM,
or THEY LIED THEIR WAY IN.
with THIS KI OF OVERKILL, THERE'S USUALLY HISTORY.
right. IF IT WAS JUST ABOUT ELIMINATING WITNESSES,
it WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SO VICIOUS.
this IS RAGE.
you THINK THEY KNOW THE FAMILIES?
it's POSSIBLE.
and THEN THERE'S THE KIDS
tucked IN, QUIET,
orderly, CONTROLLED.
speaks TO AN INTROVERT WITH SOME CAPACITY FOR REMORSE.
2 PROFILES. 2 UNSUBS.
have THESE CHAIRS BEEN MOVED?
no. IT'S ALL HOW WE FOUND IT.
so THEY'VE BEEN POSITIONED
to FACE THE AREA WHERE THE PARENTS WERE KILLED.
everything's BEEN CLEARED OUT LIKE A STAGE.
it's ENTERTAINMENT.
they SIT AND WATCH THE PARENTS DIE.
maybe.
I CAME BY ABOUT 9: 00 TO RETURN THE PYREX.
no ONE ANSWERED WHEN I RANG THE BELL,
but LIGHTS WERE ON INSIDE.
did YOU HAPPEN TO LOOK IN THE WINDOWS?
not THEN, NO.
I HAD MY CELL PHONE. I WAS GONNA CALL,
but I--I COULDN'T GET A SIGNAL, WHICH WAS STRANGE.
why WAS THAT STRANGE?
you ALWAYS GET A SIGNAL HERE.
there's A TOWER ON THE NEXT BLOCK.
uh, I LEFT THE DISH.
this MORNING, IT WAS STILL HERE...
so I CAME OVER.
th-that's WHEN I LOOKED INSIDE.
and YOU CALLED THE POLICE ON YOUR CELL.
Yeah.
these GUYS DON'T LACK CONFIDENCE.
targeting ENTIRE FAMILIES IS A HIGH-RISK ENDEAVOR.
it's POSSIBLE THEY'RE MINIMIZING THAT RISK BY JAMMING CELL PHONES INSIDE THE HOUSE.
no ONE CAN CALL OUT.
high TECH. THAT NARROWS THE PROFILE, RIGHT?
not REALLY.
Oh, YOU CAN BUY A HAND-HELD JAMMER ONLINE
for WHAT, 100 BUCKS?
I COULD USE ONE OF THOSE NEXT TIME I GO TO THE MOVIES.
Hey, GIRL. YOU'RE ON SPEAKER. BEHAVE.
or WHAT, YOU'LL SPANK ME?
so I'VE BEEN SEARCHING THE AREA FOR UNSOLVED ROBBERIES.
I FOUND 4 WITH SIMILAR ELEMENTS
phone LINES CUT, SMALL VALUABLES ONLY.
occupants TIED UP?
Yes, BUT NO HOMICIDES.
OK. THANKS, DOLLFACE. I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
well, IF THIS IS OUR GUYS,
something MADE THEM GRADUATE TO MURDER.
if WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT TRIGGER WAS,
it MIGHT TELL US HOW THEY CHOOSE THEIR VICTIMS.
well, THAT WOULD HELP.
I BE LOOKIN' INTO VICTIMOLOGY,
and SO FAR, THERE'S REALLY NOTHING TO CONNECT THE FAMILIES.
different POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS,
different CAREERS,
different SCHOOL SYSTEMS.
at THIS POINT, IT SIMPLY APPEARS
the UNSUBS ARE TARGETING THEIR VICTIMS AT RANDOM.
a REUNION IS IN YOUR FUTURE.
Hey, WHAT DO YOU--WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS?
it DOESN'T MEAN NOTHIN'. IT'S A GIMMICK.
OK.
it's YOUR TURN.
see ANYTHING YOU LIKE?
we JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA.
no, YOU HAVEN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
you're JUST TOO YOUNG TO SPEND A WEEKEND WITH SOME BOYS. THAT SIMPLE.
no, IT'S A WHOLE GROUP OF US, DAD.
look, I'VE EARNED SOME CAPITAL HERE.
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND IT HOWEVER I WANT.
who ARE YOU, GEORGE BUSH?
don't LAUGH AT ME.
gosh, I DO EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER WANTED
summer JOB, STUDENT GOVERNMENT.
drill TEAM. YOU LIKE DRILL.
to FULFILL YOUR DREAMS OF GETTING ME INTO A GOOD COLLEGE.
Oh, THAT'S NOT FAIR, CARRIE.
you KNOW, JUST BECAUSE YOU TWO WERE LOSERS IN HIGH SCHOOL
doesn't GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO TAKE IT OUT ON ME.
Hey, YOU EVER THINK ABOUT GOIN' HOME?
no.
visit THE FOLKS?
might BE TIME.
I--I DON'T WANNA EVER GO BACK THERE,
not EVER.
I'm BORED.
pick SOMEBODY, OR I'M TAKIN' YOUR TURN.
reunion.
Hey.
it JUST RAN OUT IN FRONT OF MY CAR.
is IT YOURS?
God, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
they KILLED US.
call 911!
we're LOOKING FOR 2 MEN,
probably WHITE, GIVEN THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THEY HIT,
mid TO LATE TWENTIES, INTELLIGENT, AND ORGANIZED.
these ARE CAREER CRIMINALS.
one OR BOTH HAS DONE HARD TIME,
but NEITHER PRESENTS AS A CONVICT.
they WOULD APPEAR CLEAN-SHAVEN,
well DRESSED...
neighborly. THIS HELPS THEM
talk THEIR WAY INTO THE HOMES.
they MAY ALSO BE USING A RUSE.
what KIND OF RUSE?
given THAT THE INVASIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE EVENING,
it COULD BE ANYTHING. COULD BE DOOR-TO-DOOR SALES,
person IN DISTRESS, CAR TROUBLE.
uh, DERRICK TODD LEE USED A TAPE OF A BABY CRYING
to GET WOMEN TO OPEN THEIR DOORS IN BATON ROUGE.
never UNDERESTIMATE THEIR CREATIVITY.
these MEN SHARE A VERY TIGHT BOND
and A MUTUAL COMPULSION TO KILL,
but THEIR SIGNATURES REVEAL 2 VERY DISTINCT PERSONALITIES.
one BRUTALIZES THE PARENTS.
this IS THE DOMINANT ONE-- SADISTIC,
remorseless, EXTREMELY VOLATILE.
the OTHER PREFERS A NEEDLE.
his INJECTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH AN ANGEL OF DEATH.
he's MORE WITHDRAWN,
sensitive, AND HE HAS A WARPED SENSE OF MERCY.
agent MORGAN IS PASSING OUT
a LIST OF PLACES WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE ACCESS
to THE DRUG HE USES. IT'S LONG, BUT
Hotch. THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER ONE,
and THEY'RE SENDING AN AMBULANCE.
ambulance? THERE'S A SURVIVOR?
she's LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.
the INJECTION WENT INTO THE SOFT TISSUE OF THE ARM, MISSED THE VEIN.
that's A FIRST. THIS GUY DOESN'T MISS.
like I SAID, SHE'S LUCKY.
she CONSCIOUS?
she's IN AND OUT. KEEP IN MIND
she's SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF AN ACUTE BARBITURATE OVERDOSE.
she's DROWSY, CONFUSED.
given WHAT'S HAPPENED, THAT'S PROBABLY BEST.
Yeah, YOU CAN INFORM THE NEXT OF KIN,
but ASK THEM TO KEEP IT CLOSE.
I DON'T WANT THE MEDIA TO KNOW THERE'S A SURVIVOR.
kid's IN HIS ROOM DOWN THE HALL.
how OLD?
7
you ALL RIGHT?
least THEY LEFT THE FLOWERS ALIVE, RIGHT?
looks LIKE THE BODIES WERE MOVED POSTMORTEM.
the DAUGHTER HAD BLOOD ON HER WHEN THEY FOUND HER?
she MUST HAVE WOKEN UP, COME OUT HERE, AND FOUND THEM.
you ANSWER YOUR DOOR, AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
everyone YOU CARE ABOUT IS GONE.
if IT WAS ME, I'D WANNA BE GONE, TOO.
I WENT TO GET A BAG...
but WHEN I GOT BACK, THERE WERE 2 OF THEM.
what DID THE OTHER ONE LOOK LIKE?
heavier...
HISPANIC...
quiet.
he NEVER LOOKED STRAIGHT AHEAD.
what DO YOU MEAN?
like...
a FEW TIMES, I FELT HIM STARING AT ME.
when I LOOKED UP, HE ALWAYS LOOKED AWAY.
avoiding EYE CONTACT?
then MY DAD CAME IN FROM THE STUDY, AND...
they JUMPED HIM.
they MADE DANNY CALL FOR MY MOM,
and THEY TIED THEM UP.
and THEN ONE OF 'EM WENT OVER, GOT THE THING FROM THE FIREPLACE,
he STARTED HITTING THEM WITH IT.
and THEY MADE US WATCH.
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE CAN TAKE A BREAK
no.
you NEED THIS, RIGHT?
after A WHILE, THE QUIET ONE TOOK DANNY AWAY,
and THE OTHER ONE JUST STARTED GOING THROUGH DRAWERS, LOOKING FOR STUFF.
and I RAN.
Danny. DANNY, WE GOTTA GO.
it's BETTER THIS WAY, LUCY.
what DID YOU DO TO HIM? LUCY, LISTEN
my NAME'S NOT LUCY, YOU FREAK.
I COULD TAKE CARE OF YOU NOW.
please, POR FAVOR,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY, but you have to be quiet, OK?
you're gonna make my brother mad.
Shh. Let's go.
let's go.
No!
Shh. Lucy, come on.
Hey, HOTCH!
they ONLY TAKE THINGS WITH MONETARY VALUE, RIGHT,
jewelry AND CASH, NO SOUVENIRS?
far AS WE KNOW.
one OF THEM JUST BROKE PATTERN.
witness SAYS THESE UNSUBS ARE USING CATS.
we SHOULD FIND OUT WHERE THEY MIGHT BE GETTING THEM.
there's PLENTY OF STRAYS OUT THERE.
nobody WOULD NOTICE IF A FEW WENT MISSING.
or THEY COULD WORK SOMEPLACE WHERE THEY HAD ACCESS TO ANIMALS.
could OVERLAP WITH THE PENTOBARBITAL
research LABS, VETERINARY HOSPITALS.
I'll GET GARCIA TO MAKE UP A LIST.
Carrie SAID THAT THEY REFERRED TO EACH OTHER AS BROTHERS.
it's NOT UNCOMMON FOR DUOS TO BE RELATED.
the HILLSIDE STRANGLERS WERE COUSINS.
the CARR BROTHERS PERPETRATED THE WICHITA MASSACRE.
Yeah, BUT THESE TWO ARE OF DIFFERENT RACES,
and CARRIE SAID THE HISPANIC ONE DID NOT SPEAK SPANISH,
which MAKES ME THINK...
raised IN A WHITE HOUSEHOLD. MAYBE THEY'RE HALF BROTHERS.
what IF THEY'RE ADOPTED? FAMILY DESTRUCTION PLAYS A ROLE IN THE CRIMES.
it COULD BE A REFLECTION OF THEIR OWN BROKEN HOME.
this GUY EXPRESSED AFFECTION FOR CARRIE.
we KNOW HE TOOK HER PHOTOGRAPH.
we COULD USE THAT.
if WE RELEASE NEWS OF HER SURVIVAL, IT MIGHT DRAW HIM OUT.
not COMFORTABLE WITH THAT?
OK, BUT I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE
if WE DOUBLED HER SECURITY.
I KNOW. I KNOW.
you WERE PROBABLY EXPECTING SOME NICE FAMILY
to TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ALL THIS,
but THAT'S A LIE.
they WOULD HAVE HURT YOU.
you're ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES, OK?
sleep.
sleep.
Hey, ERVIN, YOU GOT A VISITOR.
what DID YOU DO?
what DO YOU MEAN, W-WHAT DID I DO? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
that GIRL, SHE SURVIVED. IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS.
she DID?
Yeah. SHE'S PROBABLY TELLING 'EM EVERYTHING RIGHT NOW.
Hey, MAN, I--I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD SHOT.
and THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR LITTLE CRUSH.
Hey, IT'S NOT A CRUSH. I-IT
it DOESN'T MATTER!
maybe THIS IS A SIGN, GARY.
m-maybe WE SHOULD STOP. I MEAN...
I'm MAKING GOOD MONEY HERE.
screw THE MONEY.
but THE KIDS, THEY
the KIDS ARE BETTER OFF. YOU KNOW THAT.
don't GO SOFT ON ME NOW.
we're ALL WE GOT. WE'RE FAMILY.
we're FAMILY.
OK, GREAT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
Hey. SO CARRIE'S BEEN CLEARED TO GO.
well, I WISH SHE HAD SOMEWHERE TO GO.
no LUCK WITH THE L. A. THING?
can't THIS GIRL CATCH A BREAK?
it JUST RAN INTO THE ROAD.
is IT YOURS?
wake UP. WAKE UP. WAKE UP.
it's OK.
Oh, IT WAS DADDY.
it's OK. IT'S JUST A DREAM.
OK. I'M OK.
OK? YEAH.
we, UH--WE BROUGHT YOU A CHANGE OF CLOTHES.
I--I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO GRAB YOU,
so I JUST GOT THREE OF EVERYTHING.
from THE HOUSE.
looks LIKE A FLOWER SHOP IN HERE.
Yeah. THEY ALL STARTED, UM,COMING IN AFTER THE NEWS BROADCAST...
exact SAME FLORAL ARRANGEMENT WAS IN THE ORTIZ LIVING ROOM.
could BE COINCIDENCE.
or THE SENDER WAS IN THE HOUSE,
associated IT WITH HER.
no NOTE?
no, JUST A BLANK CARD FROM THE FLORAL SHOP.
get GARCIA TO TRACK THE DELIVERY,
and REID'S GOT SOMETHING FOR US WHEN YOU'RE DONE.
Hey, GARCIA. IT'S EM.
why CATS? SORRY?
evil HAS NO BOUNDARIES.
well, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I THINK THEY GO PEACEFULLY.
Yeah. HOW DO I CATCH THESE GUYS?
uh, BACK-TRACE A FLOWER DELIVERY FOR ME.
this IS THE LAYBOURNE HOUSE,
where WE BELIEVE OUR UNSUBS GRADUATED FROM ROBBERY TO MURDER.
did YOU FIND A TRIGGER?
not UNTIL I LOOKED AT THE DAUGHTER'S AUTOPSY REPORTS.
uh, CHECK OUT THE BRUISES ON HER TORSO.
she WAS BEATEN?
but NOT BY OUR UNSUBS.
the CORONER NOTED THOSE BRUISES WERE SEVERAL DAYS OLD.
uh, IT TURNS OUT SHE'D BEEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM 3 TIMES IN LESS THAN 2 YEARS.
the D. S.S. HAD EVEN BEEN NOTIFIED.
so THE LAYBOURNES WERE ABUSING THEIR DAUGHTER. WHERE'S THIS GOING?
one OF THE UNSUBS
decimates PARENTAL FIGURES,
but WE KNOW THE STATISTICS THERE.
it's--it's LIKELY HE WAS ABUSED HIMSELF.
so YOU'RE SAYING THE UNSUB RECOGNIZED THE SIGNS OF ABUSE,
flew INTO A RAGE, AND KILLED THE PARENTS?
anger DISPLACEMENT. HE'S GETTING REVENGE FOR HIS OWN CHILDHOOD ABUSE.
so YOU THINK WHAT, THE VICTIMS WERE BEATING THEIR KIDS?
uh, THE LAYBOURNE CASE WAS JUST THE TRIGGER,
but NOW THEY SEE ALL PARENTS THE SAME.
that DOESN'T EXPLAIN THE KIDS.
maybe IT DOES. THINK OF
the FAMILY ANNIHILATORS JOHN LIST AND MARK BARTON.
they THOUGHT THEY WERE SAVING THEIR KIDS BY KILLIN' 'EM.
but WHAT IS HE SAVIN' THEM FROM?
life WITHOUT THEIR PARENTS,
without LOVE, LIFE LIKE HIS.
they're ORPHANS. WHAT IF THEY BOTH
grew UP IN A THIRD-PARTY HOUSEHOLD?
what, LIKE A FOSTER HOME?
didn't CARRIE DESCRIBE AN AVERSION TO EYE CONTACT?
oppositional DEFIANT DISORDER.
often SEEN IN KIDS WHO GREW UP IN FOSTER HOMES.
guys, I THINK WE MAY HAVE FOUND OUR GIRL'S SECRET ADMIRER.
Garcia TRACED THE FLOWERS?
Yep. PAID FOR BY PHONE WITH A CREDIT CARD???????????
detective.
flowers WEREN'T THE ONLY THING THEY BOUGHT
on THAT STOLEN CREDIT CARD. $31 WORTH OF GAS
at A STATION 3 BLOCKS FROM HERE.
Hey, PAUL. PAUL. THE STATION
see IF YOU CAN PULL THE SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE,
I. D. THAT CAR.
security CHAIN'S BEEN BROKEN.
they COULDN'T LIE THEIR WAY IN THIS TIME.
media BLEW THEIR M. O.
they're SPEEDING UP, FEEL US GETTING CLOSE.
this IS CLOSE?
talk TO ME, GARCIA.
so, FELONS IN THE DENVER AREA WITH FOSTER BACKGROUND, STRESS ON ASSAULTS AND BURGLARIES.
the PHONE BOOK. WHAT'D YOU GET?
foster SYSTEM'S A BIT OF A BREEDING GROUND, GO FIGURE.
well, TRY CROSSING IT WITH WITH OFFENDERS HAVING WORKPLACE ACCESS TO SMALL ANIMALS AND/OR PENTOBARBITAL?
how MANY NAMES? 9.
matching ALL 3 CRITERIA.
sending THEM NOW.
now WE'RE CLOSE.
cameras AT THAT GAS STATION GRABBED A VISUAL OF THE CAR.
oldsmobile, MID-EIGHTIES, PARTIAL PLATE ONLY.
anything ON THE DRIVER?
it WAS FUZZY.
well, THEN I GUESS IT'S GONNA BE UP TO HER.
cbs SHE UP FOR IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
this ONE.
are YOU SURE?
OK, THAT'S A ERVIN ROBLES.
last KNOWN IS 39 HILL STREET.
that's DOWNTOWN.
employed BY THE TY POUND. PO. LET'S GO.
your PARENTS WOULD BE REALLY PROUD OF YOU.
it's TOO LATE TO BE A GOOD DAUGHTER NOW.
Oh, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I WAS HORRIBLE TO THEM.
and NOW THEY'RE GONE.
why DID THEY DO IT?
I MEAN, THERE HAS TO BE A REASON, RIGHT?
Oh, YOU'LL DRIVE YOURSELF CRAZY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE REASON.
I GO CRAZY EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES.
it MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
with WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER.
like WHAT, THEY WERE ABUSED OR SOMETHING?
there's A GOOD CHANCE.
are THERE ANY HAPPY FAMILIES?
thank YOU.
excuse ME, SIR.
I'm AGENT HOTCHNER WITH THE FBI.
this IS AGENT PRENTISS.
we're LOOKING FOR ERVIN ROBLES.
ervin's OFF TILL THE WEEKEND.
do YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE WE MIGHT FIND HIM?
you MIGHT WANT TO TRY HIS APARTMENT.
we've BEEN THERE. IT'S ABANDONED.
where DO YOU SEND HIS CHECKS?
he PICKS THEM UP. WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
we'd JUST LIKE TO TALK TO HIM.
who CAN WE TALK TO THAT ACTUALLY KNOWS HIM?
well, NOBODY, REALLY.
he COMES IN, DOES HIS JOB, AND LEAVES.
real QUIET. EFFICIENT, THOUGH.
doing WHAT?
well, ACTUAL TITLE'S
animal CARE TECHNICIAN,
but, REALLY, HE'S KIND OF THE ON-SITE KEVORKIAN.
we NEED YOU TO CALL HIM.
supervisor LEFT A MESSAGE FOR ERVIN TO COME IN RIGHT AWAY.
work EMERGENCY.
he ALSO SAID A MAN STOPPED BY YESTERDAY,
got INTO A HEATED ARGUMENT WITH ERVIN.
the DESCRIPTION SOUNDED A LOT LIKE THE ONE CARRIE GAVE. bU
the PARTNER--DID HE SAY WHAT THEY WERE FIGHTING ABOUT?
he COULDN'T HEAR IT.
we NEED A NAME ON THIS GUY.
well, UNTIL WE FIND ERVIN,
there's ONLY ONE PERSON THAT CAN TELL US THAT.
the FOSTER MOM.
my GOD. ERVIN?
well, I MEAN, HE HAD BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS.
they ALL DO. BUT NOTHING WE COULDN'T HANDLE.
and HE HASN'T BEEN ACTING ALONE, MRS. MANWARING.
he's GOT A PARTNER.
perhaps SOMEONE ELSE WHO GREW UP IN YOUR CARE.
Tyler, THE ADULTS ARE TALKING HERE.
I JUST WANT SOME MILK.
can YOU OPEN THE FRIDGE?
you KNOW THE RULES.
huh! THEY'LL EAT YOU OUT OF HOUSE AND HOME IF YOU LET THEM.
is THERE ANYONE ERVIN WAS ESPECIALLY CLOSE TO?
someone HE WOULD HAVE LOOKED UP TO?
somebody WHO PROTECTED HIM?
we TRIED WITH HIM, BUT...
he TESTED US.
have YOU KEPT IN TOUCH WITH HIM?
Oh, GOD, NO.
Gary LEFT THE DAY HE TURNED 18,
never LOOKED BACK.
ERVIN WAS A MESS WHEN HE GOT HERE.
got SEPARATED FROM A YOUNGER SISTER.
where DID SHE GO?
nobody TOLD ME.
siblings GET SEPARATED ALL THE TIME.
but THEY FIND NEW ONES HERE.
like ERVIN FOUND GARY?
what WAS THE NAME OF HIS SISTER,
the ONE HE WAS SEPARATED FROM?
Oh, LET ME THINK. UH...
he USED TO CALL HER NAME OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,
wake THE WHOLE HOUSE UP.
Hal, WHAT WAS THAT GIRL'S NAME?
Rosie, I THINK.
Yes! LUCY, LUCY, THAT WAS IT.
Carrie SAID HE CALLED HER LUCY.
Yeah, JUST LEAVING.
ERVIN RETURNED THE CALL. HE'S ON HIS WAY TO WORK.
Thanks. THANK YOU.
subject SPOTTED APPROACHING ON FOOT FROM NORTH ALLEY.
ERVIN ROBLES, RIGHT THERE!
get YOUR ASS DOWN ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW!
where YOU GOIN', ERVIN, HUH? WHY ARE YOU RUNNING?
give ME YOUR HAND.
let's GO.
you're NOT HELPING YOURSELF IF YOU DON'T TALK TO ME.
he's GIVING ME NOTHING.
do YOU WANT ANOTHER CRACK AT HIM?
no. WE CAN'T KEEP GOING AROUND LIKE THIS.
so LET HIM STEW. WEAR HIM DOWN.
we DON'T HAVE TIME.
we NEED HIM TO FIND GARY.
kids WHO GREW UP LIKE HE DID,
they're INCAPABLE OF FORMING ATTACHMENTS.
it's NOT LIKE WE'RE GONNA EARN HIS TRUST.
their WHOLE M. O. WAS PREDICATED ON THE UNION OF THEIR TWO PERSONALITIES,
and WITH ERVIN OUT OF THE PICTURE,
there's NO TELLING WHAT GARY COULD DO.
so HE WON'T TALK TO US.
but MAYBE HE'LL TALK TO FAMILY.
right THIS WAY.
remember, HE'LL BE IN, UH, HANDCUFFS, LEG IRONS.
there'll BE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
and I WILL BE IN THERE WITH YOU.
OK.
you DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT TO, CARRIE.
I DO.
remember, WE'RE INTERESTED IN GARY.
his WHEREABOUTS, HIS NEXT MOVE.
I WILL KEEP HIM ON POINT ABOUT THAT, CARRIE.
just TRY YOUR BEST TO KEEP HIM ENGAGED.
this WAY.
OK, I'M--I'M SORRY.
can--can WE JUST STOP AND THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE?
she'll BE OK.
she's A KID.
what IS SHE TRYING TO PROVE HERE?
that SHE CAN BE A GOOD DAUGHTER.
Hey. YOU'RE HERE.
did YOU, UH,
did YOU GET THE FLOWERS THAT I SENT?
Yeah.
pretty.
they WERE TO SAY THAT, UH...
that I'M SORRY.
flowers AREN'T ENOUGH, ERVIN.
we NEED GARY.
that WON'T MAKE IT UP, THOUGH.
it's A START.
No!
they're GONNA SEND YOU AWAY NOW.
don't YOU SEE? THAT'S WHAT THEY DOV WITH ALL THE STRAYS.
they SEND THEM AWAY.
that's WHY I MAKE THEM GO TO SLEEP,
so THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER.
ERVIN, MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SUFFER IF WE CAN'T FIND GARY.
so WHEN YOU KILLED MY BROTHER,
you WERE DOING HIM A FAVOR?
and WHAT ABOUT ME? IT'S TRUE.
let's JUST ADDRESS ONE THING AT A TIME.
I JUST WANTED TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
you LOOK SO MUCH LIKE LUCY, I JUST...
I COULDN'T--I
I KNOW--I KNOW IT'S SELFISH, BUT
selfish? IT'S INSANE.
OK, CARRIE, LET'S TAKE A BREAK.
what HAPPENED TO YOU THAT WAS SO BAD?
she USED TO MAKE IT... GO DARK.
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT WE USED TO CALL IT. SHE WOULD...
put ME IN THE BATH TO PRAY.
and THEN SHE'D HOLD MY HEAD DOWNOW
under THE WATER.
sometimes I COULD STAY AWAKE...
for LIKE A MINUTE...
and SOMETIMES A LITTLE MORE.
then IT WOULD ALL GO DARK.
they've STILL GOT KIDS IN THAT HOUSE.
another KID, ANOTHER WELFARE CHECK.
let's CALL D. S.S. AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THEM OUT OF THERE.
what IS SHE DOING?
they CAN'T HURT YOU ANYMORE, ERVIN.
I WANTED TO STOP,
but GARY, HE...
he WENT THROUGH IT WAY, WAY WORSE WHEN WE WERE KIDS,
and HE...HE NEVER GOT THE CHANCE TO FIGHT BACK.
so HE FOUGHT THOSE OTHER FAMILIES.
only BECAUSE I WOULDN'T GO BACK.
back?
Gary's GOING TO YOUR FOSTER HOME,
isn't HE?
get HIM OUT OF THERE.
Oh, YOU DID SO GOOD.
what IS ALL THIS?
we HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT GARY MAY BE ON HIS WAY HERE TO HURT YOU.
me? I DON'T UNDERSTAND!
these MURDER ARE REHEARSALS OF WHAT HE WANTS TO DO TO YOU.
cause OF WHAT YOU DID TO HIM IN THIS HOUSE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
ma'am, WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO DEBATE THIS.
the FACT IS, YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND ARE IN DANGER.
I--I HAVE TO PICK UP THE CHILDREN AT SCHOOL.
we'll SEND SOMEONE TO PICK THEM UP.
the ONLY WAY WE CAN PROTECT YOU IS IF YOU GO BACK INSIDE.
Hey, BUDDY.
you DON'T REMEMBER ME?
I USED TO LIVE IN YOUR HOUSE, A LONG TIME AGO.
you WERE JT A LITTLE GUY.
we're NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK TO STRANGERS
you're NOT SUPPOSED TO WEAR YOUR SHOES IN THE HOUSE,
not SUPPOSED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AFTER BEDTIME.
does SHE STILL WEAR THE REFRIGERATOR KEY AROUND HER NECK?
I'm GARY. I'LL GIVE YOU GUYS A RIDE.
come ON.
witnesses SAW THE KIDS GETTING INTO
a LATE EIGHTIES OLDSMOBILE ABOUT 20 MINUTES AGO.
I HEARD. DENVER P. D. SET UP A 20 MILE PERIMETER.
what DOES HE WANT WITH THE KIDS?
with ERVIN OUT OF THE WAY, MAYBE GARY'S TRYING TO DO HIS JOB.
he MAKES THEM SLEEP.
Reid, WHAT?
we GOT HIM. HE'S AT A DONUT SHOP 2 MILES FROM THE SCHOOL.
black AND WHITES SAW THE CAR, CALLED IT IN.
kids?
Ah, WE GOT A VISUAL ON GARY AND THE BOY,
but I DON'T SEE THE GIRL.
are YOU THE POLICE? YEAH.
he TOLD ME TO GIVE THIS TO YOU.
we MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM, HOTCH.
guys, GUYS, FALL BACK, I DON'T WANT THEM FEELING BOXED IN.
I GOT SHARPSHOOTERS LINING UP.
tell THEM TO KEEP THEIR SAFETIES ON.
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM FIRST.
Hotch? YEAH?
got THE CLERK.
that GUY SITTING AT THE TABLE WITH THE LITTLE BO
I'd LIKE TO SPEAK TO HIM, PLEASE.
you, UH, GOT A CALL OVER HERE, MAN.
grab YOUR STUFF. COME ON.
who's THIS?
I'm THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN YOU AND A BULLET.
bring IT. I ALWAYS WANTED TO DIE IN A DONUT SHOP.
and NEVER SEE ERVIN AGAIN?
he TOLD US WHAT THE MANWARINGS DID TO YOU IN THAT HOUSE.
I N'T CARE WHAT HE TOLD YOU, IT'S HISTORY.
they're THE OBJECTS OF YOUR ANGER, GARY,
not THAT LITTLE BOY IN THERE.
it's TOO LATE FOR THE BOY, REGARDLESS.
no. IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT, GARY.
and DEEP DOWN, I THINK YOU KNOW
that HE STILL HAS A CHANCE.
he DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOU.
maybe.
maybe NOT.
so WHAT SAY WE LEAVE IT UP TO HIM.
what IS IT? WHAT'D HE SAY?
come HERE! COME ON.
Gary, PUT YOUR HANDS UP WHERE I CAN SEE THEM. DON'T MOVE!
get DOWN ON YOUR KNEES.
interlace YOUR FINGERS BEHIND YOUR HEAD.
give ME THIS HAND.
give ME THIS HAND.
get ON YOUR FEET.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID, BUT NICE WORK.
Thanks.
Yeah, I UNDERSTAND THAT, I'M JUST...
I'm ASKING IF THERE'S SOME TYPE OF ALTERNATIVE FOR THEM.
nothing?
Yes, I GOT IT.
don't ASK ME TO LIKE IT.
well, WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
social SERVICES WON'T INTERVENE UNTIL THEY DO A FULL INVESTIGATION.
we HAVE TO TAKE THEM HOME?
Yeah.
hang ON A SECOND.
I TEACH CRISIS NEGOTIATION.
I CO-WROTE THE TEXTBOOK,
and IN 12 YEARS, I'VE NEVER TALKED ANYBODY OFF A LEDGE SO FAST.
Oh, BIT OF A MILESTONE, HUH?
why'd YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR, GARY?
sugar CRASH.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND.
kid, LISTEN TO ME.
anything YOU EVER NEED, ANY PROBLEM YOU MIGHT BE HAVING HERE AT HOME,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW YOU CAN CALL ME.
any TIME, TYLER.
you UNDERSTAND?
any TIME.
this SUCKS.
so MEET AT 4: 30 ON THE STAIRS,
and YOU CAN DIRECT ALL YOUR QUESTIONS
to LIEUTENANT NELLIS OF THE DENVER P. D. ALL RIGHT?
they'll BE TAKING EVERYTHING.
what HAPPENED NEXT?
you're WELCOME.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING WAS UP UNTIL HE, UH, CAME AND GOT THE PHONE.
that's WHEN I SAW THE PIECE.
then I HANDED HIM THE PHONE.
excuse ME, DID YOU SAY PIECE?
uh, YEAH, REVOLVER OF SOME SORT.
he HAD IT STUCK IN HIS PANTS.
DIYOU CLEAR A GUN? NO.
Yeah, REID?
Hotch, THE CLERK SAID GARY HAD A GUN,
but WE DIDN'T RECOVER ANYTHING HERE.
you SURE? YEAH.
I SAW NELLIS TURN HIM INSIDE OUT. HE HAD NOTHING ON HIM.
I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY HERE SOMEWHERE.
a GUN DOESN'T JUST WALK AWAY.
Yeah, HOTCH?
we JUST DROPPED THEM OFF. WE'RE LEAVIN'.
the BACKPACKS? NO, WHY? WHY WOULD WE SEARCH THE BACK
drop THAT GUN.
are YOU HURT? NO.
come ON, KID, TAKE IT EASY.
they're LIES.
I KNOW.
but YOU COULD HAVE COME IN HERE, AND YOU COULD HAVE MADE HER PAY,
and YOU DIDN'T, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOOD.
you're NOT GARY.
no.
you're NOTHING LIKE HIM.
look AT ME.
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.
OK?
let's MAKE A DEAL.

and I PROMISE YOU, I WILL WALK YOU OUT OF HERE
and YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO COME BACK.

yeah?
OK.
give ME THE GUN.
I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.
I COULD TAKE HER.
take HER?
to D. C.
you MEAN TO LIVE WITH YOU?
Yeah.
why WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT?
I HAVE ROOM, MONEY,
and, YOU KNOW, SHE'S SMART.
2, 3 YEARS, SHE GOES TO COLLEGE.
this IS THE JOB,
and I NEED TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN BE OBJECTIVE.
and I NEED TO KNOW THAT I CAN BE HUMAN.
heard FROM THE FAMILY,
and THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY FROM L. A.
Oh.
that's...
that's GREAT.
tell ME THEY RESTOCKED THE BAR.
I CALLED AHEAD.

I JUST--I JUST WANT TO HEAR HIS VOICE.
Thanks.

Yeah.

Carrie's FAMILY.
good.
I'm GLAD.
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA, THOUGH.
what's THAT?
you. KIDS.
I CAN SEE IT.
mommy!
there's USUALLY NO ACCEPTABLE EXCUSE FOR VIOLENCE,
but FOR YOU I AM MAKING AN EXCEPTION.
Oh, MY GOD, AGENT ROSSI.
this CAN'T BE EVERYTHING.
I'm SORRY, SIR?
this IS NOT EVERYTHING.
I WAS TAKING A SHOWER... YOU'RE COMING IN.
this IS THAT GALEN FILE I ASKED YOU TO PUT TOGETHER,
that DOUBLE HOMICIDE IN INDIANAPOLIS?
uh, NO, NO, SIR, YOU DIDN'T ASK ME
to PUT ANYTHING TOGETHER. YOU JU
there's MORE TO THIS CASE FILE.
um...uh, SIR, CAN THIS WAIT TILL THE MORNING?
and WHERE ARE MY NOTES, MY ORIGINAL CRIME SCENE NOTES?

you JUST TOLD ME TO LOOK UP AN OLD CASE.
do I HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW TO LOOK FOR EVERYTHING?
what KIND OF A RESEARCHER ARE YOU?
I'm NOT A RESEARCHER, I'M A TECHNICAL ANALYST.
what THE HELL DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
you LEFT THE MIDDLE OF MY BACK TOTALLY UNLOOFAED.
SSA ROSSI.
agent ROSSI, I AM AWARE THAT
fraternization BETWEEN BUREAU EMPLOYEES
is AGAINST THE RULES. HOWEVER
it's THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THIS CRIME.
20 YEARS TOMORROW 3 CHILDREN WOKE UP AND FOUND THEIR PARENTS MURDERED.
whoever DID IT IS STILL OUT THERE.
it's TIME THEY PAID FOR IT.

indianapolis, Indiana
Hey, YOU DANCE NICE.
Yeah, I COULD TELL YOU LIKED IT A WHOLE $2. 00 WORTH.
Yeah, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU MORE IF I HAD IT.
I RAN OUT.
well, YOU SHOULD'VE LEFT.
don't I GET TO LOOK ALL I WANT FOR THE COVER CHARGE?
Yeah, COVER CHARGES INCLUDE THE PARKING LOT. LOOKING'S OVER.
why ARE YOU SO PISSED OFF, HUH?
you WANT TO SEE PISSED OFF?
Hey, WHOA.
come ON.
I'm JUST GONNA GO BACK IN THE CLUB, OK?
OK.
what DO YOU WANT?
freak.
within THE CORE OF EACH OF US IS THE CHILD WE ONCE WERE.
this CHILD CONSTITUTES THE FOUNDATION
agent HOTCHNER?
Yes.
Ah.
you MUST BE DR. REID.
abner MERRIMAN, ASSISTANT WARDEN.
you're HERE TO SEE OUR INFAMOUS INMATE HARDWICK.
Yeah. HE AGREED TO MEET WITH US
as PART OF OUR CRIMINAL PERSONALITY RESEARCH PROJECT PRIOR TO HIS EXECUTION.
I've READ SOME OF YOUR STUDIES IN POLICE JOURNALS.
serial KILLERS ARE A KIND OF HOBBY OF MINE.
Chester's THE ONLY ONE I'VE EVER MET IN PERSON, THOUGH.
I BET YOU'VE MET QUITE A FEW.
sir, WE'D VERY MUCH LIKE TO GET STARTED
as SOON AS WE CAN.
Oh, OF COURSE, OF COURSE. FORGIVE ME.
um, WE, UH...
we DON'T REALLY HAVE INTERROGATION FACILITIES,
but I DO HAVE A SMALL ROOM THAT YOU CAN USE.
you're NOT ARMED?
we SECURED OUR WEAPONS BEFORE WE ARRIVED.
it's NOT OUR FIRST TIME IN A PRISON.
no, NO, I SUPPOSE THAT'S TRUE.
I HAVE TO SAY, WHEN I HEARD THAT HE CONTACTED YOU,
I WAS SURPRISED.
Why?
he DOESN'T REALLY TALK MUCH.
to ANYONE.
well, THAT USUALLY CHANGES WHEN SOMEONE'S ABOUT TO DIE.
no...
mommy...
it's MORNING.
No! CONNIE!
CONNIE...CHILL.
it's THE BROTHER. IT'S GEORGIE.
what?
you WERE DREAMING AGAIN.
I'm SORRY.
you NEVER HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO ME FOR THE DREAM.
what TIME IS IT?
you're LATE FOR WORK.
Yeah, UH, ABOUT THAT, UH...
I SORT OF PUNCHED A GUY.
did YOU GET FIRED?
Yeah. 53 BUCKS. YOU'RE, LIKE,
the WORST STRIPPER IN THE WORLD.
well, TO GET MORE I GOTTA SHOW MORE.
and TOPLESS IS BAD ENOUGH.
well, WHY DON'T YOU JUST QUIT IF IT BUGS YOU THAT MUCH?
cause WE GOTTA EAT.
Yeah, WELL, WE NEED SOME STUFF, BY THE WAY.
so GO GET IT.
Where's ALICIA?
left LAST NIGHT WITH SOME DUDE.
what DUDE?
I DON'T KNOW. SOME DUDE IN A JEEP.
got YOUR YEARLY GIFT, I SEE.
they LEFT IT IN MY CAR THIS TIME.
they LEFT THIS FOR ME ON THE PORCH, TOO.
son OF A BITCH IS NEVER GONNA LEAVE US ALONE.
happy 20th ANNIVERSARY, RIGHT?
I HATE YOU.
the, UH, DOOR WILL OF COURSE BE LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE,
and THIS BUTTON HERE,
it SOUNDS AUDIBLY AS WELL AS TRIGGERS
a FLASHING LIGHT TO SIGNAL THE GUARDS WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED.
thank YOU.
are THESE THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS?
Oh. UH, SOME OF THEM, YES.
God...
I KNEW WHAT HE DID, OF COURSE,
but I...
you KNOW, NEVER SAW...
23 VICTIMS LIKE THIS.
sometimes IN THESE INTERVIEWS THEY TALK ABOUT CRIMES THEY WERE NEVER CHARGED WITH,
so IT MIGHT EVEN BE MORE.
is IT EVER LESS? NO.
uh, PLEASE.
paying ATTENTION TO THESE ITEMS
projects A KIND OF IMPORTANCE ON THEM.
when HE COMES IN, I'D LIKE TO GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY
to SHOW US WHICH PARTS OF THE CRIMES HE THINKS ARE IMPORTANT.
sorry. OF COURSE. SORRY. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
chains LEFT ON, RIGHT?
that's PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA.
no. IT WON'T BE NECESSARY.
it WON'T?
Mm-hmm. YOU SURE?
we're JUST GONNA TALK, RIGHT, CHESTER?
Hotch IS IN CONNECTICUT, RIGHT?
with REID. THEY LEFT LAST NIGHT.
they're DOING A CUSTODIAL INTERVIEW.
Chester HARDWICK. OH, DAMN.
he DOESN'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE ON HIS MIND WHEN HE'S DEALING WITH A GUY LIKE HARDWICK.
so WHAT DO WE DO?
you GOT ANY IDEA WHAT ROSSI WAS WORKING ON?
I--I THINK GARCIA MIGHT KNOW.
he STOPPED BY HER PLACE LAST NIGHT.
what?
Why?
I'm NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY.
cause...
he SAID HE WANTED TO KEEP IT BETWEEN US.
he MIGHT NEED OUR HELP.
he DIDN'T ASK ANYONE FOR HELP.
Rossi IS A GUY
who COLOR CODES HIS HANDWRITTEN NOTES IN HIS NOTEBOOKS.
blue PEN FOR EVIDENTIARY ITEMS,
red PEN FOR SUPPOSITION AND THEORY.
the GUY IS A FUSSY, ANAL-RETENTIVE NEAT FREAK
who NEVER LEAVES ANYTHING OUT OF ITS PLACE.
I WOULD SAY THIS IS A SCREAM FOR HELP.
he's IN INDIANAPOLIS,
on A 20-YEAR-OLD DOUBLE HOMICIDE.
he SAID IT'S TIME SOMEONE PAYS FOR IT.
and HE WAS UPSET.
indianapolis?
Yeah. HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL FLIGHT THIS MORNING,
he PICKED UP A BUREAU SUV HALF AN HOUR AGO.
jet's AVAILABLE.
let's GO.
agent ROSSI.
Gary WILLIS, INDIANAPOLIS POLICE DEPARTMENT.
I ASKED FOR CAPTAIN GILES.
Yeah, HE DIED A YEAR AGO.
that's A SHAME.
he WAS A GOOD COP.
do YOU HAVE THE GALEN FILES?
Yeah, THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.
do YOU HAVE ANYTHING NEW?
if WE DO, IT'S NOT IN THIS FILE.
you DON'T KNOW?
well, WHO'S WORKING ON THIS?
20 YEARS IS A LONG TIME COLD.
when DO YOU STOP LOOKING FOR A DOUBLE MURDERER?
you KNOW, I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS AN FBI CASE.
well, IT ISN'T. NOT OFFICIALLY.
I WAS ON THE ORIGINAL SCENE THE DAY IT HAPPENED.
you PROBABLY KNOW MORE ABOUT IT THAN I DO, THEN.
at LEAST YOU HAD SOMEONE TO TALK TO.
no ONE'S LIVED HERE SINCE THAT DAY.
there's A HOUSEKEEPING SERVICE THAT COMES IN
once A WEEK, BUT OTHERWISE IT'S EMPTY.
I KNOW. I own it
I BOUGHT IT AT AN AUCTION 2 YEARS AFTER THE MURDERS.
Why?
the MONEY WENT TO THE GRANDMOTHER.
she RAISED THEM AFTER...
well, SHE DIED SOME YEARS LATER AND...
they're STILL LIVING OVER THERE AT HER HOUSE.
that's PRETTY PERSONALLY INVOLVED.
do YOU KNOW THESE PEOPLE OR SOMETHING?
no.
it WAS THE KIDS, I GUESS. I...
kind OF GOT ATTACHED.
look, I DON'T MEAN TO BE A HARD-ASS.
it's NO PROBLEM.
we GOING IN?
no.
I've SPENT YEARS LOOKING IN THAT HOUSE.
there's NOTHING THERE, NOTHING WE MISSED,
no EVIDENCE WE DIDN'T FIND.
then WHY ARE YOU HERE?
I WAS HOPING YOU HAD SOMETHING NEW.
I'm SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.
no BOTHER.
thanks FOR COMING.
sit DOWN.
I'd LIKE THIS WINDOW OPENED.
I'll ANSWER ANY QUESTION YOU HAVE,
but ONLY IF THIS WINDOW IS OPEN.
go AHEAD.
you WERE BORN APRIL 4, 1950?
does MY BIRTHDATE REALLY MATTER?
it's CUSTOMARY FOR US TO START AT THE BEGINNING.
we WANT TO TRY TO KNOW AS MUCH AS WE CAN ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD.
there's NOTHING TO KNOW. IT WAS AVERAGE.
I LIVED IN A NICE HOUSE ON A QUIET STREET.
I ATE CEREAL. I WENT TO SCHOOL. I WATCHED CARTOONS.
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
you DIDN'T LIVE IN A NICE HOUSE ON A QUIET STREET.
you GREW UP IN A SERIES OF PROJECTS IN EAST BRIDGEPORT, EACH ONE WORSE THAN THE LAST.
you SPENT YOUR TEENAGE YEARS
peeping INTO YOUR FEMALE NEIGHBORS' WINDOWS
and BURGLARIZING THEIR UNDERWEAR DRAWERS WHEN YOU GOT THE CHANCE.
and YOU SET 100 SMALL FIRES
for WHICH YOU SPENT 2 YEARS IN JUVENILE DETENTION.
we've DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH, MR. HARDWICK,
and WE'VE TALKED TO ALMOST EVERYONE YOU'VE EVER KNOWN...
including YOUR MOTHER.
good OLD JEAN?
I'll BET SHE WAS A REAL TREAT.
good OLD JEAN'S DOWN THE STREET IN THE STATE HOSPITAL.
at THIS POINT, LYING TO US
isn't REALLY POSSIBLE
or HELPFUL.
well, THEN, YOU'RE WRONG.
about WHAT?
I STARTED A LOT MORE THAN 100 FIRES.
Oh, MY--! BEAUTIFUL.
Aah!
I'M...S-SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU.
I JUST, UH,
I--you JUST LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL MULTITASKING.
what ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WORK HERE, TOO.
Yeah, IN YOUR OWN OFFICE, 2 FLOORS DOWN.
I CAN'T COME OVER AND VISIT?
are YOU INSANE?!
what's WRONG?
have YOU FORGOTTEN LAST NIGHT?
I WILL NEVER FORGET LAST NIGHT.
we WERE CAUGHT FRATERNIZING BY ONE OF MY BOSSES.
you KNOW--AHEM
it WAS RUDE OF ROSSI TO SHOW UP AT YOUR PLACE AFTER WORK HOURS.
rude? YOU FOUND HIM RUDE?
you KNOW, MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE A TALK WITH HIM.
straighten HIM OUT.
you WANT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT AGENT ROSSI?
no, WHAT I WANT IS FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO COME UP HERE AND...
and KISS MY GIRLFRIEND.
and--and IF THAT MEANS I HAVE TO TALK TO HIM,
well, THEN--THEN THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO.
girlfriend?
yes?
if YOU GET, LIKE, WITHIN 100 FEET OF AGENT ROSSI, I WILL UNLEASH
an UNRECOVERABLE VIRUS ON YOUR PERSONAL COMPUTER SYSTEMS
that WILL REDUCE YOUR ELECTRONIC WORLD
into SOMETHING BETWEEN A COMMODORE 64
and A BLOCK OF GOVERNMENT CHEESE.
call ME LATER.
you KNOW, THERE'S NOT REALLY MUCH TO THIS FILE, GARCIA.
Oh, THERE'S A LATENT FINGERPRINT
that's MAKING A SECOND RUN THROUGH APHIS AS WE SPEAK.
as SOON AS I GET RESULTS I'LL LET YOU KNOW.
and THEN THERE'S ALSO APPARENTLY SOME CRIME SCENE NOTESTHAT AGENT ROSSI WROTE UP THAT I'M STILL SPELUNKING FOR.
so HE WAS ON THE ACTUAL CRIME SCENE WITH THE LOCAL DETECTIVES?
could BE WHY IT BOTHERS HIM SO MUCH.
well, I HIGHLY DOUBT THIS WAS HIS FIRST SCENE.
Yeah, BUT IT WAS A BAD ONE.
the WEAPON WAS A LONG-HANDLED AX.
Yeah, BUT WE'VE SEEN WORSE SINCE HE'S BEEN BACK.
there's NOTHING ELSE CROSS-REFERENCED,
no OTHER CRIMES TIED TO THIS?
no, NOTHING I CAN FIND. I MEAN, CERTAINLY NOTHING
with THESE SIGNATURE ELEMENTS.
OK, SO IT'S A DOUBLE HOMICIDE, YES,
but A SINGLE OCCURRENCE WITH NO APPARENT ISSUE OF STATE LINES?
was THERE A REQUEST FROM THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR THE FBI's HELP?
I DON'T THINK SO.
so THEN WHY IS THIS A B. A.U. CASE?
I DON'T THINK IT WAS.
all RIGHT, GARCIA, I WANT YOU TO DOUBLE-CHECK
any OTHER UNSOLVED MURDERS IN INDIANA
or THE SURROUNDING STATES NEAR THIS TIME.
something THIS BRUTAL DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A ONE-TIME THING.
you've GOT IT.
what IS IT?
what IS IT ABOUT THIS CASE FOR HIM?
what DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?
how PAPA KICKED ME AND JEAN'S ASS EVERY SINGLE DAY?
that THE KIND OF THING YOU WANT TO HEAR?
if IT'S TRUE.
nobody GIVES A DAMN ABOUT THE TRUTH.
agent ROSSI?
anything COME BACK YET ON THAT PRINT?
no. NO MATCHES. NOTHING ON FILE. SORRY.
what ABOUT MY NOTES?
those I HAVE. DO YOU HAVE A PDA?
cause I CAN E-MAIL THEM TO YOU.
what's A PDA?
it's A PERSONAL DIGITAL
never MIND. IS THERE A FAX NUMBER WHERE YOU'RE AT?
I'm AT THE PALMER HOTEL.
I'll BE BACK THERE LATER. I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER.
OK. I WILL FIND IT.
Thanks.
all RIGHT, I'LL CHECK BACK WITH YOU IN, OH...
and, SIR, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW.
agents PRENTISS AND MORGAN
found YOUR OFFICE IN DISARRAY THIS MORNING.
so?
WELL...THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT YOU.
well, TELL THEM NOT TO BE.
Yeah, UH, SIR, THAT'S THE THING,
see? I'M SORRY
you TOLD THEM ABOUT THIS CASE?
Yeah, I'M... WE'RE ALL WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
damn IT, I ASKED YOU TO KEEP THIS BETWEEN US.
I'm SORRY, SIR.
I KNOW, AND I...
they're GOING TO SEE YOU.
they're COMING HERE?
I DON'T NEED ANYBODY'S DAMN HELP.
temperature's DROPPING.
it's THAT TIME OF YEAR.
warm DAYS, COLD NIGHTS.
it'll BE SUMMER SOON.
but NOT FOR YOU.
no...
not FOR ME.
let's, UM,
let's TALK ABOUT THE SPECIFICS OF THE CASE.
why DID YOU CHOOSE SHEILA O'NEAL?
you GOTTA SHOW ME A PICTURE. I DON'T KNOW THEIR NAMES.
is THAT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT,
some CHANCE TO RELIVE ALL OF THIS?
I HAVE AN EXCELLENT MEMORY.
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO HEAR THE TRUTH.
truth IS, THEY MEANT NOTHING TO ME.
they WERE TOYS, A DIVERSION,
and FROM THE MOMENT I DECIDED TO KILL THEM, THEY WERE DEAD.
they BEGGED, THEY CRIED,
they BARGAINED, AND IT DIDN'T MATTER,
because THEY DIDN'T MATTER.
sometimes I WISH I WAS NORMAL,
that I'D HAD A REGULAR LIFE.
but I DIDN'T.
why DID YOU ASK US HERE?
I WANTED TO SMELL THE AIR.
what?
they've GOT ME ON DEATH WATCH.
24-hour-a-day ISOLATION,
and I WILL BE UNTIL THEY TAKE ME TO THE DEATH CHAMBER.
so I WANTED TO SMELL THE AIR ONE LAST TIME BEFORE I DIE.
thank YOU FOR GIVING ME THAT.
let's PACK IT UP.
should WE AT LEAST
no, NO.
have A NICE TRIP, CHESTER.
you're GOING WHERE YOU BELONG.
it's 5: 17.
evening YARD STARTED AT 5: 00.
guard STAFF'S OUTSIDE WITH THE POPULATION.
there WON'T BE ANYONE TO OPEN THAT DOOR FOR...
at LEAST 13 MINUTES.
and THEY TOOK?????
while YOU WERE DOING YOUR RESEARCH,
maybe A QUESTION OR TWO ABOUT SECURITY TONES
would HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA.
I HEARD THE TONES.
so YOU PLANNED TO BE LOCKED INSIDE WITH ME,WITH NO GUNS OR WEAPONS.
I WON'T NEED A GUN.
there's NO WAY THEY'RE GONNA EXECUTE ME NEXT WEEK,
not AFTER I KILL 2 FBI AGENTS.
you SAVED MY LIFE BY COMING HERE.
but UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
I'm NOT A 5-FOOT-TALL, 100-POUND GIRL.
all YOUR LIFE
you've GONE AFTER VICTIMS WHO COULDN'T FIGHT BACK.
and THE REST OF THE TIME YOU SPENT LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER,
worried ABOUT THE KNOCK ON THE DOOR,
scared THAT SOMEBODY LIKE ME WOULD BE ON THE OTHER SIDE
waiting TO PUT YOU AWAY.
at YOUR CORE, YOU'RE A COWARD.
Chester, DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU KILLED THOSE WOMEN?
what?
earlier YOU SAID YOU WISH THAT YOU WERE DIFFERENT.
I CAN TELL YOU WHY YOU KILLED THEM,
why YOU ARE...WHAT YOU ARE.
you're BUYIN', I'M DRINKIN'.
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US COULD AFFORD THIS PLACE OTHERWISE.
Yeah, I KNOW I CAN'T.
go HOME.
we THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED SOME HELP.
you're WRONG.
come ON, NOW, ROSSI.
bounce SOME THEORIES OFF US.
fresh EYES CAN'T HURT.
this ISN'T EVEN A B. A.U. CASE.
maybe NOT YET, BUT I CAN MAKE ANYTHING A B. A.U. CASE IF I WANT TO.
it's ABOUT PAPERWORK AND I KNOW THE PAPERWORK.
why DO YOU CARE?
because YOU DO.
you CAN TELL ME WHY I DID THE THINGS I DID?
I THINK SO.
I DO.
your MOTHER'S BIPOLAR
and ALMOST CERTAINLY AN UNDIFFERENTIATED SCHIZOPHRENIC.
your FATHER SUFFERED SEVERE SHELL SHOCK IN THE WAR,
what WE NOW REFER TO AS POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.
as FAR AS I CAN TELL, HE REMAINED CLINICALLY DEPRESSED THE REST OF HIS LIFE.
53% OF ALL SERIAL KILLERS HAVE SOME FORM OF MENTAL ILLNESS IN THEIR FAMILY.
in YOUR CASE, BOTH YOUR PARENTS
suffered PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS,
which THEY LARGELY TOOK OUT ON...
they BEAT EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS THEY BEAT YOU,
so VIOLENCE BECAME A NATURAL EXPRESSION OF LOVE...
there's SOMETHING CALLED THE HYPOTHALAMIC REGION OF THE LIMBIC SYSTEM.
it's THE MOST PRIMITIVE PART OF THE BRAIN.
it WANTS WHAT IT WANTS
without CONSCIENCE AND WITHOUT JUDGMENT.
it's WHAT MAKES BABIES CRY WHEN THEY'RE HUNGRY, UH,
scream WHEN THEY WANT AFFECTION, BECOME ENRAGED WHEN A TOY IS TAKEN AWAY.
in MOST CHILDREN, A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR MOTHER
counters THE HYPOTHALAMUS AND MAPS THE CHILD'S BRAIN
into HEALTHY EMOTIONAL RESPONSE...
your HYPOTHALAMUS NEVER LEARNED CONTROL.
it STILL OPERATES ON THAT PRIMITIVE LEVEL...
your RECORDS INDICATE THAT YOU DISPLAY THE SYMPTOMS OF SATYRIASIS.
you're OBSESSED WITH SEX.
sex AND LOVE ARE CROSS-WIRED WITH PAIN.
additionally, YOUR HYPOTHALAMUS WON'T ALLOW YOU
to STOP SEEKING THE-- THE DESIRES THAT IT WANTS.
so YOU BECAME A SEXUAL SADIST...
no FUNCTIONINIG SEXUAL PARTNER WILL EVER WILLINGLY SUBMIT
to THE PAINFUL DESIRES THAT YOU HAVE.
the ONLY WAY YOU CAN SERVE THEM
is BY MAKING A PARTNER COMPLIANT,
making SURE THAT THEY DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO.
and YOU ENSURE THAT BY KILLING THEM.
earlier, YOU SAID YOUR VICTIMS NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
I THINK YOU KNOW DEEP DOWN...
it WAS YOU WHO REALLY NEVER HAD A CHANCE.
everything ALL RIGHT IN HERE?
fine. WE'RE DONE.
is THAT TRUE, I NEVER HAD A CHANCE?
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.
I WAS HERE ON A SERIAL RAPIST IN '88.
it WAS PRETTY SHORT WORK.
the GUY WASN'T GONNA WIN ANY I. Q. CONTESTS.
the DAY AFTER, WE, UH, COLLARED HIM,
a LOCAL DETECTIVE WAS DRIVING ME TO THE AIRPORT,
and, UH, HE HEARS A CALL ON THE WALKIE
of KIDS SCREAMING IN A HOUSE
not FAR FROM WHERE WE WERE.
he ASKS IF I MIND TAKING THE JOB IN WITH HIM.
we WERE FIRST ON THE SCENE.
inside WE FOUND...
found THIS.
the AX HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND,
but IT HAD BEEN WIPED CLEAN.
it TURNS OUT IT BELONGED TO THE FAMILY.
the, UH, OLDEST DAUGHTER, CONNIE,
told ME HER FATHER...
bought IT ON CHRISTMAS EVE A FEW MONTHS EARLIER...
to CUT DOWN THE CHRISTMAS TREE.
now I, UH, ALWAYS ASSOCIATE THE WHOLE THING
with CHRISTMAS.
never BEEN ABLE TO PUT A TREE UP MYSELF AGAIN.
so, HE--HE NEVER HURT THE KIDS AT ALL?
not PHYSICALLY.
but HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE KIDS WERE IN THE HOUSE.
he ONLY HURT THE PARENTS AND THEN LEFT.
OK, SO, USING A WEAPON HE FOUND AT THE SCENE
and NOT ELIMINATING ALL OF THE POTENTIAL WITNESSES, THAT MAKES HIM DISORGANIZED.
but HE LEFT NO EVIDENCE, WHICH SUGGESTS HE'S ORGANIZED.
there WAS A FINGERPRINT.
but IT WAS BEHIND THE BEDROOM DOOR.
I DON'T EVEN THINK HE KNEW IT WAS THERE.
there SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRINTS IN OTHER PLACES,
but THEY WERE WIPED CLEAN.
an OPEN BACK DOOR,
a--a DRINKING GLASS LEFT IN THE KITCHEN.
and THAT ONE GOOD PRINT...
was NOT A MATCH ANYWHERE.
I've BEEN OVER THIS A MILLION TIMES.
I--I KEEP THINKING,
if THERE WAS JUST ONE MORE PIECE,
one MORE THING TO GO ON.
the ANSWER WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.
he MIGHT BE DEAD.
I HAVE TO BE SURE.
Rossi, IF HE'S DEAD, YOU MAY NEVER REALLY KNOW.
when WE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE...
before ANY OF THE OTHER UNITS GOT THERE...
I COULD HEAR THEM...
before I EVEN GOT OUT OF THE CAR.
it WAS A WARM MORNING, AND THE, UH...
the WINDOWS WERE OPEN IN THE UPSTAIRS BEDROOM.
and THEIR VOICES...
floated OUT INTO THE STREET.
they WERE CRYING
and CALLING FOR THEIR MOMMY AND DADDY.
3 TERRIFIED CHILDREN SCREAMING FOR THEIR MURDERED PARENTS.
I've SEEN SO MUCH DEATH AND PAIN.
but THAT SOUND...
it's BEEN 20 YEARS
and I CAN STILL HEAR THEM SCREAMING EVERY NIGHT...
crying.
if I CAN'T TELL THEM FOR SURE
that WHOEVER'S RESPONSIBLE WILL NEVER DO IT AGAIN...
that SCREAMING MIGHT NEVER STOP.
alicia! LET'S GO!
in A MINUTE.
now, LEESH!
God!
guess WHAT-- MY SISTER'S A BITCH.
call ME.
you DIDN'T GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER.
why DO YOU HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT?
where WERE YOU FOR 2 DAYS?
it WAS ONLY ONE WHOLE DAY.
where WERE YOU?
I'm 23 YEARS OLD, CONNIE.
you SHOULD'VE CALLED.
you're NOT MY MOTHER.
Hi, CONNIE.
I BROUGHT THE TEAM
you NEED TO STOP THIS.
excuse ME?
we THOUGHT THAT IF WE DIDN'T CALL YOU BACK THE LAST COUPLE TIMES
you WOULD JUST GIVE UP AND LEAVE US ALONE.
well, I KNOW THAT IT HURTS,
but I'M ONLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE
someone PAYS FOR YOUR PARENTS' DEATHS.
we DON'T CARE ANYMORE.
it's BEEN 20 YEARS.
we NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE PAST IT.
please!
I WON'T BOTHER YOU KIDS AGAIN.
and YOU'LL STOP IT WITH THE GIFTS, TOO?
gifts?
what ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO WITH A BUNCH OF TOYS?
they REMIND US OF THE WORST DAY OF OUR LIVES.
I never send you any gifts
this IS IT?
it's ALL WE COULD FIND.
we THREW A LOT OF THEM AWAY.
I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT THIS.
we THOUGHT YOU WERE SENDING THEM.
first WE KIND OF LIKED IT,
and THEN IT JUST BECAME A BAD REMINDER.
these ARE INCREDIBLY CHEAP, AREN'T THEY?
where WOULD YOU EVEN BUY TOYS LIKE THAT?
or WHY?
how DID YOU RECEIVE THEM?
they WERE USUALLY LEFT ON THE FRONT PORCH AT NIGHT.
mine WAS FOUND IN MY CAR THIS TIME.
so HE'S FOLLOWING YOU.
there WAS A PICKUP OUTSIDE THE
uh, WHERE I WORK.
I JUST... I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.
what DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THE PICKUP?
uh, ALL I SAW WAS THE SHAPE AND THE HEADLIGHTS.
Morgan, OBSESSIONAL CRIMES ARE YOUR SPECIALTY.
well, THERE'S TWO KINDS OF OBSESSIONAL OFFENDERS
that WOULD SEND GIFTS TO SURVIVORS.
sadists WHO WANT TO MAKE THE FAMILIES KEEP RELIVING THE CRIME,
or GUILT-LADEN OFFENDERS,
desperately TRYING TO FIND SOME TYPE OF WAY TO APOLOGIZE.
sadists USUALLY USE SOMETHING
they KNOW WILL REMIND THE FAMILY OF THE PERSON OF THE CRIME.
jewelry, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS.
these DON'T LOOK LIKE THE KIND OF THINGS YOU WOULD SEND
to INFLICT PAIN ON SOMEONE.
so, GUILT-LADEN.
you KNOW, THEY ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE THE KIND OF THING A CHILD WOULD SEND.
OK. WELL, IT'S RARE,
but AN UNSUB WHO FEELS THIS MUCH GUILT
sometimes COMMITS THE CRIME UNINTENTIONALLY.
they TEND TO BE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED,
extremely LOW I. Q. OFFENDERS,
and GENERALLY, WELL, THEY'RE PHYSICALLY LARGE
and THEY'RE VERY STRONG.
strong ENOUGH TO HURT SOMEBODY ACCIDENTALLY.
like LENNIE IN OF MICE AND MEN
exactly.
he NEEDED HELP, THEN.
there WASN'T A FRAGMENT OF EVIDENCE LEFT AT THE SCENE.
that's NOT LOW I. Q.
well, USUALLY THEY'RE ASSISTED BY AN OLDER RELATIVE,
and IT'S ALMOST ALWAYS A PARENT.
and THIS PARENT RATIONALIZES THAT THE UNSUB WOULD NEVER TRY TO HURT ANYBODY.
see, IN A LOT OF WAYS, THIS TYPE OF UNSUB...
they're SORT OF...
overgrown CHILDREN.
when YOU GET GARCIA ON THE PHONE,
tell HER WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR OTHER HOMICIDES HERE.
get HER TO LOOK INTO A STRING OF LESS SERIOUS OFFENSES IN THIS AREA
parks, PLAYGROUNDS
involving CHILDREN, BUT NOT NECESSARILY CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN INJURED OR ABUSED.
OK.
see, AN UNSUB LIKE THIS,
when THEY SEEK OUT CHILDREN, THEY WANT TO PLAY WITH THEM.
they DON'T REALLY WANT TO HURT THEM.
but IT'S THEIR SIZE.
it FRIGHTENS PEOPLE.
this COULD BE THAT PIECE YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.
that WAS SMART TO GET HARDWICK TO FOCUS ON HIMSELF
long ENOUGH FOR THE GUARDS TO COME BACK.
I FIND THAT I DO SOME OF MY BEST WORK UNDER INTENSE TERROR.
I'm SORRY.
for WHAT?
I ANTAGONIZED THE SITUATION.
no, YOU DIDN'T.
well, I CERTAINLY DIDN'T HELP.
AH...I GUESS YOU REALLY DIDN'T HELP.
so HALEY WANTS ME TO SIGN THE DIVORCE PAPERS UNCONTESTED
so NOBODY WASTES MONEY ON LAWYERS.
you DON'T WANT TO?
what I WANT I'M NOT GONNA GET.
OK, CRIME-FIGHTERS, I GOT THE INFORMATION YOU WERE LOOKING FOR,
but IT MAY LEAD TO MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS.
Oh, OF COURSE.
there ARE SCADS OF OPEN PETTY CRIMES, AS DESCRIBED, IN THE VERY AREA OF INDIANA IN THE LAST 20 YEARS.
but HERE'S THE RUB
a LARGE PORTION OF THEM ONLY OCCUR
in THE LAST WEEK OF MARCH
and THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL EVERY YEAR.
and THEN IT GETS WEIRDER, 'CAUSE THE SAME KIND OF CRIMES CROP UP IN SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS,FOR THE NEXT 2 WEEKS, AND THEN DES MOINES, IOWA,IN THE COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THAT.
so HE'S TRAVELING.
on A SPECIFIC SCHEDULE FOR YEARS?
maybe HE'S A SALESMAN?
who TAKES A DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED PARTNER ON A SALES CALL?
what ABOUT A CARNIVAL?
carnival?
we WENT TO A CARNIVAL THE DAY BEFORE.
it's THE LAST THING WE DID AS A FAMILY.
did ANYTHING HAPPEN?
no.
no, WE HAD TO LEAVE EARLY.
there WAS THIS CLOWN THAT...
made ME A BALLOON ANIMAL.
it DIDN'T EVEN LOOK RIGHT.
but THEN HE KIND OF FOLLOWED ME AROUND.
he DIDN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING,
but MY MOM GOT AFRAID, SO WE LEFT.
you NEVER TOLD US THAT.
I DIDN'T EVEN REMEMBER IT UNTIL NOW.
Penelope, PULL PERMITS.
find OUT IS THIS CARNIVAL IS STILL IN BUSINESS.
the STUDY IS READY.
you GUYS LOOK AROUND. PRENTISS, YOU COME WITH ME.
Jeff! GET MORE TIE-DOWNS OVER THAT FERRIS HAULER!
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO SLOW DOWN HALFWAY ACROSS ILLINOIS BECAUSE THAT MORON LEFT PIECES HANGING OFF AGAIN!
idiots!
you LOOK LIKE YOU'RE IN CHARGE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE ACTUALLY PAY GOOD MONEY
to PLAY THESE FIXED GAMES.
men.
excuse ME?
it's NOT PEOPLE.
it's MEN.
is THAT A FACT?
only A MAN WOULD WASTE $50
trying TO WIN THAT $3. 00 STUFFED ANIMAL.
you PULLING OUT IN A HURRY?
that's THE WAY THIS BUSINESS WORKS.
gotta BE SET UP WHERE THE MONEY IS.
right NOW THAT AIN'T HERE.
where YOU HEADED TO NEXT, SPRINGFIELD?
we'd LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ONE OF YOUR CLOWNS.
did YOU GO TO CARNIVALS AS A KID?
Oh, YEAH, EVERY YEAR.
Yeah, ME, TOO.
first PLACE I HAD A DRINK.
clown.
come ON.
clowns?
this AIN'T A CIRCUS.
clowns ARE FOR THE CIRCUS.
you DON'T HAVE ANY CLOWNS IN YOUR CARNIVAL?
how ABOUT A GUY WHO MAKES BALLOON ANIMALS?
might.
might?
at TIMES.
how LONG'S HE BEEN WITH YOU?
what IS THIS?
this GUY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLAINED ABOUT.
kids ARE UNCOMFORTABLE AROUND HIM.
you'd HAVE GOTTEN REPORTS FROM PARENTS.
I CAN'T REMEMBER EVERY COMPLAINT I GET, MISTER.
it's NOT MISTER.
it's AGENT ROSSI, FBI.
now, DO YOU HAVE A SON?
a SON.
the GUY WE WANT TO TALK TO,
he'd HAVE BEEN A BIG PROBLEM FOR YOU.
you'd HAVE GOTTEN RID OF HIM A LONG TIME AGO, UNLESS...
it WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO HOLD DOWN A JOB FOR LONG,
much LESS 20 YEARS.
20 YEARS?
I REALLY AIN'T GOT TIME FOR THIS.
make TIME.
all RIGHT.
he DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT THOSE PEOPLE.
it WAS MY FAULT AS MUCH AS HIS.
I GOT BUSY WITH ONE OF THE RIDES BREAKING DOWN
and HE WANDERED OFF.
he JUST WANTED TO SEE THE LITTLE GIRL AGAIN.
he LIKED HER.
he WANTED TO PLAY.
he WOULD NEVER HURT ANYONE.
he WENT INTO THE FATHER'S ROOM BY MISTAKE.
he COME AFTER HIM WITH AN AX
and HE HIT JOEY WITH IT.
so HE GOT MAD, THAT'S ALL.
I MEAN, THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT UNDERSTANDABLE
he GETS HIT WITH AN AX AND HE GETS MAD?
he WAS SORRY AS SOON AS HE DID IT.
he EVEN PUT THEM BACK IN BED.
he JUST GOT ANGRY.
and I WAS TOO LATE!
I WAS TOO LATE!
I COULDN'T SAVE THEM.
but EVERY YEAR I TAKE HIM BACK
and I MAKE HIM REMEMBER WHAT HE DID.
I'd EVEN MAKE HIM PICK SOMETHING FROM THE JOINTS
to GIVE THEM.
he NEVER FORGETS.
never.
I MAKE SURE OF THAT.
Never!
look...
he's A GOOD BOY.
daddy! FBI!
daddy!
get YOUR ASS OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW.
daddy!

Garcia AND KEVIN SITTIN' IN A TREE
get OUTTA HERE. ARE YOU SERIOUS?
just WHEN I THOUGHT NOTHING SCANDALOUS WAS EVER GONNA HAPPEN AROUND HERE.
what? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
didn't YOU HEAR JJ?
the SONG MEANT SOMETHING? NO, I MISSED IT.
IT--IT...
you KNOW WHAT? NEVER MIND.
what?
there IS NO FORMULA FOR SUCCESS
Arthur RUBINSTEIN.
damn.
and severe thunderstorms and localized downpours will rumble over areas of northern California and central Nevada tonight and tomorrow.
flood warnings for story, Lyon and Carson counties are in effect - That's great. - until 8: 00 am tomorrow morning.
off the big road, south of Sin City.
B.A.U.,....
Oh, I can't. I have a date.
you got a date? With who?
my hot tub.
now that sounds like a party.
you're so not invited.
hold up, guys.
change of plans.
I'm glad I caught you.
is everything ok?
I've been on the phone with a sheriff in Nevada.
there's been a series of suspicious accidents in the Reno area that may be connected.
JJ, this can't wait till morning?
I don't think so.
if I'm right about this, I think we'll be leaving first thing tomorrow.
sorry.
three nights ago outside of Reno, this car was hit by a tractor trailer.
any survivors?
the truck driver walked away unharmed.
jonathan and Rebecca Gallen, the passengers in the car, were doa.
when the local sheriff arrived on the scene,
he noticed several. No blood spatters inside the car.
no seat belt burns.
no laceration from the air bags.
they were dead before the accident.
the autopsy confirmed that. And the cause of death: Blunt force head trauma and evidence of rape and torture to the woman.
the unsub wasn't very successful at hiding the fact that he murdered two people.
there's a chance he has gotten away with it before.
after I spoke to the sheriff, I had Garcia look into any similar accidents near the California, Nevada border.
she found two with a similar M. O. in the past couple of weeks.
both were couples, in a car, hit by a tractor trailer.
it's always a man and a woman stopped right in the middle of the road.
it's always at night on a remote highway.
it can't be a coincidence the victim type and this very specific M. O. are the same in all three cases.
was Garcia able to find any connection between them?
one thing they have in common is that they all disappeared for 48 hours prior to the accidents.
we know what he does to his victims during that time.
we just need to figure out where he finds them.
I can barely keep my eyes open.
you've been asleep since we left Reno.
Really? Oops.
Ian, look out!
are you ok? - Yeah.
that was close.
maybe we both need some rest. - Yeah.
you coming in?
no. I'm gonna call your mom and check in with the kids.
you better lock the doors.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
sure you're not.
damn it, Ian. You scared me.
time to get your second wind.
Oh, god.
we've got this little paradise all to ourselves.
what do you mean?
look around. We're the only ones here.
Oh, it's such a beautiful night. - Yeah.
let's get to the cabin.
I'm so glad we took this trip.
me, too.
thomas fuller wrote, "a fool's paradise is a wise man's hell."
it's so the baby can't hear.
what's he listening to? - Beethoven.
I personally preferred Mozart, myself.
but be careful to limit his exposure to one hour a day.
amniotic fluids have a tendency to amplify sound.
thanks for the reminder, doc.
OK, so, all three crashes were on highways outside of Carson City, Lake Tahoe and Reno.
all cities with a large and diverse, transient population.
not to mention the thousands of locals mixing with seasonal workers.
an endless pool of victims to choose from.
Rebecca Gallen was beaten badly.
ribs broke ante-mortem.
he'd need time and privacy to do this.
that would suggest the killer either lives or works in the area.
he's going to such extremes to try and hide the murders.
maybe he has a connection to the victims.
what does the press know?
all media outlets are reporting an accident.
one thing going for us, the killer has no idea we know.
that helps us.
JJ, when we land, would you explain to sheriff Bruner and his deputies how important it is to keep this quiet?
got it.
if the unsub finds out we're here, all bets are off.
he could change his M. O. or just pick up and find his victims somewhere else.
am I dreaming?
time to get up. - No, it's a nightmare.
I want banana pancakes.
please?
Abby Corbin, we don't have any kids, dogs or parents to deal with for eight more hours.
please let me sleep.
doesn't melted butter and maple syrup sound so good?
I'll tell you what sounds really good right now.
what?
peace and quiet.
you're so not a morning person.
you knew that before we got married.
from this point on, the company line is simple.
the FBI's here investigating a missing person.
you may be thinking, if the public knew the truth, they might be able to help us.
but we can't risk this getting out
because this killer needs to believe he's getting away with murder.
any future calls related to this investigation can be directed to me or Agent Jareau.
remember, if we can just keep a lid on this now, it'll only help us later.
Thanks.
thank you, Agent Jareau. - Yeah. Just doing my job.
Ah, it's not much, but it's a place to hang your hats.
all we need is a table and an evidence board.
sheriff, if you don't mind, some of us would like to go to the site of the accident.
I'll have a deputy take you.
Rebecca Gallen's father is coming in to claim the bodies.
why don't you let us take care of that?
I'd appreciate it. I'll drive you myself.
do you have any aerial photos of the crash sites?
we didn't think to get any. - Not a problem.
I'll have our technical analyst get some from the NSA.
I'd like to see what the areas surrounding the highways are like.
first victims, Fritz and Johanna Dietrich,
were found ten days ago, visiting from Germany.
their accident site was on highway 50 just south of Tahoe.
second couple, Melissa and Tom Taylor, were from Oregon.
they were found on the 267, northeast of Tahoe, not far from the interstate.
it's right here.
and the latest victims, Jonathan and Rebecca Gallen, were from Arizona.
their accident occurred between Reno and Carson city on highway 395.
right here.
all three couples were staying in the area without reservations.
and the only transactions on their credit cards were from gas stations hundred of miles away.
the common theme here is no paper trail.
if no one can contact them or trace them, they become the perfect victims.
Rebecca Gallen's father is going to be here soon.
I'll talk to him.
maybe he can help us fill in some of the blanks.
if you don't mind, I'd like to go home now and tell my wife that I didn't kill that couple.
sir, we're gonna have to ask you not to do that.
but everyone believes I killed them.
you don't know what that feels like.
we understand what we're asking of you, but this is an extremely important part of our investigation.
we need the public to continue to believe this was an accident.
Mr. Jones, we will catch this guy.
and when we do, your good name will be vindicated. I promise you that.
well, ok.
if I can think of anything that would be of use to you, I'll let you know.
thanks for your time, sir.
this guy could've left the bodies anywhere.
on the side of the road, buried in the ground.
but he didn't. And there's a reason for that.
Yeah. He's taunting us.
no, he's not.
this behavior tells us the risk of leaving the bodies where he killed them is greater than the risk he takes staging these accidents.
thank you.
satellite photos.
look at that. All three accident sites have similar blind curves.
the grade of the hill about the same, every location.
now, what are these areas just off the highway?
some are fire roads, some are trails for off-road vehicles. Advs. and such.
we know this guy's organized.
looks like he plans his escapes in advance.
Mr. Sanders, I'm very sorry that you have to be here under these circumstances.
no father should have to claim his daughter's dead body.
you're also here for your son-in-law Jon, correct?
uh, I'm gonna I need a full copy of that accident report.
we're suing that truck driver and his employer.
Mr. Sanders, your daughter and son-in-law were hit by the tractor trailer,
but that's not how they died.
what are you talking about?
they were dead hours before the collision.
no. The police told us they died in the accident.
Yes, sir. I understand that. We had to wait for the autopsy results.
and they confirmed that they had been murdered.
sir, I do understand how hard this is.
we believe Rebecca and Jon are the third couple to die in these circumstances.
who would want to kill my baby?
I have a couple of questions.
we found camping equipment in the back of Jon's car.
Yeah, yeah. He was real big on the outdoors.
this time he had to drag her along with him.
do you know where he liked to camp? - No.
where he liked to hike? - I don't know.
did he ever bring Rebecca souvenirs? T-shirts from anywhere?
I don't know.
how about restaurants? Places he liked to eat.
my baby has a...
had a sweet tooth. And, uh...
jon would always bring her back these donuts.
we found a matchbook from a diner... Flo's? Does that ring a bell?
maybe. I can't be sure. It was a real popular place. But...
he always brought some back for her.
thank you.
be right with you.
it's not even lunchtime yet.
the sign said people will travel for miles for Flo's donuts.
sorry to keep you waiting. Would you like a dozen to share?
FBI.
ma'am, we're trying to trace the steps of a couple that may have been here a few days ago.
Darling', I've waited on 87 folks since we opened this morning.
somebody would have to come through here doing cartwheels on fire for me to remember.
would you take a look anyway please?
well, I'll be. I do remember them.
were they doing cartwheels? - No, but I was.
the lady left me a $10 tip for breakfast, two days in a row.
nice couple.
they in some kind of trouble?
there's no cell service up here.
and that's a bad thing, why?
I do want to check in on the kids.
we'll be home by dinner.
Hey, I can't find my underwear. Have you seen them?
you caught me.
I'm serious.
I don't know. I threw them in that vicinity over there.
you know what? They didn't just get up and walk away.
well... Here you go.
all right. Thank you.
Hey, it's breakfast.
OK. This chair is bolted to the floor.
someone really thinks we'd want to steal this crap?
one man's trash... - Yeah, I know. I know.
did you find your underwear?
no.
it's not funny. - I'm not laughing.
but if I start looking around and find it...
you owe me lunch.
I'll take that bet.
well, at least you finally got my breakfast.
I didn't order this.
right.
I didn't.
well, neither did I.
OK. So who knew I wanted banana pancakes?
it's time to go.
we have a witness who can put the Gallens at a diner in Sherwood.
so it's possible they were staying close by.
I thought you forgot about me. It hurts.
Garcia, what information do you have on Sherwood, Nevada?
Sherwood.
a lovely town that is east of lake Tahoe near the state line.
this area has close to 300 hotels, motels and resorts.
Garcia, can you send us a list of addresses and phone numbers? On its way, kind sir.
anything else I can do for you?
not for now. - Thank you, Garcia.
you, my fine furry friends, are welcome.
remind me to have her drug tested.
so what's our plan?
I'll start narrowing down the list. - Then what?
we knock on every door and show pictures of the Gallens.
that could take days, weeks even.
I know we don't have the manpower, but at this point, what choice do we have?
Abby, let's go. Car's running.
OK, ok.
did you get everything? - Yes. I got it.
you sure? - Yes.
Ian, it's stuck.
you've got to just jiggle the handle.
I can't. - All right. Well...
what the hell? - Wait a minute.
Ian, there's someone outside. Hello!
open it! Open the window. - Open the door!
morning, JJ.
sorry for the wake-up call.
it's all right. Wasn't sleeping.
it looks like we've got a possible missing person.
Ian and Abby Corbin were in Reno for the weekend.
they were supposed to be home yesterday.
Where's home? - San Luis Obispo.
they could've driven right through Sherwood.
they've already been missing a night.
his mom's looking after their two kids.
call me when everybody gets here.
what is this? Left-over Kung Pao chicken? That's disgusting.
what?
the smell of Chinese food makes you sick,
but you don't even flinch when you look at those pictures.
she's pretty tough.
how much longer are you going to do that?
we can't just sit here all night.
well, we haven't been sitting... Ian.
and it's morning. - What?
Yeah.
is that cement? Calm down.
damn it, abby, I'm trying to get us out of here.
what was that?
where did he go?
I don't see him.
let me see it, please. Let me see.
Ian and Abby Corbin have already been missing for over 24 hours,
which means we may only have until tonight to find them.
according to their families, they left Reno yesterday
and were planning on stopping somewhere for the night.
they didn't use a credit card.
unless they travel with a lot of cash, the room wasn't too expensive.
they were not traveling on the interstate.
that eliminates over half of our previous search.
sounds like we're looking for somebody who works the night shift at a back road motel.
and we think he's most likely in his early to mid-thirties.
why is that?
abducting couples is an ambitious task.
and this guy's had time to perfect his skill.
he could be older.
don't get hung up on his age.
that's the hardest thing to predict.
what we do know is that females take extensive beatings from him.
that, combined with the sexual assault, tells us he's a violent anger excitation rapist.
a sexual sadist like this can't get off unless he's torturing
and watching the effects on his victims.
part of the torture is psychological.
this is another reason he takes couples.
chances are he forces one to watch his power over the other.
because only the women suffer sexual torture, he's likely a malignant misogynist.
this typically stems from an extreme hatred towards a woman
who was relentless in her psychological and physical abuse.
how do you know the dad wasn't the abusive one and he's just continuing the cycle?
only a woman could make him hate women this much.
the idea of the "terrible mother" is best illustrated in world mythology by the negative aspects of the great mother.
instead of nurturing her children, she destroyed him.
and given this upbringing, it's highly unlikely he'd ever been in a relationship, let alone been married.
and since he works in the service industry, he's forced to deal with a lot of people.
so he can probably hide his aversion to women until he gets them behind closed doors.
with that said, we shouldn't rule out anyone with prior offenses toward women.
given the amount of time he spends with his victims, he requires a great deal of privacy.
he may even utilize an ATV to get away from the accident sites,
so the property may back up onto an off-road trail.
we should therefore concentrate on the most remote motels first.
thank you.
Oh, my god! Ian!
he was right there!
you just watched me do that.
you always second guess me. Trust me.
it's not going to break.
I'm always second-guessing you? - Yeah.
when?
you want to get into this now?
we never should have stopped.
Oh, so it's my fault? - No. I didn't - I didn't say that.
but you want to. Go ahead.
fine. If you hadn't been hung over, we could've been on the road a lot earlier.
so it is my fault.
no, it's mine.
I should've cut you off.
sorry for enjoying myself on vacation. You should try it sometime.
I have fun.
I just don't have to be drunk.
once a year I have a few too many at dinner.
don't confuse me with your father.
Oh, my God.
haven't seen them.
how many employees you got working here?
I've got 11 people on payroll.
you got a night manager?
we rotate the shift.
got a nice set-up in the back office.
all the movie channels.
your employees, they have access to all these rooms?
we all have master keys, yeah.
I need to see a list of all of those names.
OK.
you get a lot of people staying over?
some hard-core riders.
guys come up here for a night or two.
ever get any couples?
you know any girls who'd stay here?
Yeah. I guess it is a bit... rustic.
Yeah. They might get dirty.
so the rentals keep you busy.
tourists, mainly. Most locals have their own.
imagine it's pretty easy to get yourself turned around out there.
I guess.
but it's faster getting around on trails than on the roads.
so, you run this place alone?
more work, more money.
do you mind if I keep this?
help yourself. - Thanks for your time.
he's going to jam that thing in your face again.
I need some air.
do you want to get hurt?
here we go.
the silent treatment.
you know what? It's two speeds with us lately, Ian.
we either lash out or we shut down.
that's not true, Ab. - Really?
then what do you call this?
sorry about that. I was around back.
I'm Wayne Dryden. I'm the manager.
we're looking for these people. Have you seen them?
their names are Abby and Ian Corbin.
they must have done something really bad to bring the FBI all the way out here.
they're missing. Is there anyone else here who may have seen them?
well, it's just me and the old lady.
and she's down at the mall for this Hummel expo.
she collects those things. Do you know them?
I've heard of them.
she's got those things taking over my office.
they are everywhere in there. It's a sight.
can I help you, sir? - Do you have any rooms?
one moment, sir.
if you see or hear anything, here's my card.
thank you.
I hope you find who you're looking for.
I'm sorry, sir. We have a full house.
but you just said - No, I didn't.
well, you have any ideas where we could stay?
sure. You can drive back down the road...
and if you turn left, there's about 200 places.
and turn right, there's about 199.
it's already dark, and we've barely gotten through half of the motels.
maybe he's not in the remote areas.
you think he's hiding in the middle of everything?
maybe.
let's go. - Wait. Guys?
Garcia found a connection between a motel handyman and Rebecca Gallen.
they went to high school together.
so, I thought maybe he was connected to other victims.
it turns out he's not, but there's something else that all of the women have in common.
Rebecca Gallen was found in a bra, t-shirt, skirt and flip flops.
Johanna Dietrich in a dress and sandals.
Melissa Taylor was wearing a bra, tank top, and jeans.
none of them were wearing underwear.
how do you know it was taken?
because they all packed it in their bags,
but none were wearing it during the collisions.
he leaves his victims in a car without their underwear and waits for them to be hit.
a violent collision of metal against flesh.
it's like the accidents are the final rape.
this sexual aspect didn't show up over night.
this is something he's been building up to.
what do you think your parents told them when we didn't come home?
that we're on an adventure.
what's going to happen to them?
Ian. - Abby. Abby, Abby, are you ok?
Yeah.
what's he doing?
Ian. - What?
those aren't mine. He was just in here.
get behind me.
Ian, I'm scared.
so this guy sees these collisions as some kind of rape.
we know that an underwear fetish typically begins in adolescence with peeping in neighbors' windows.
when that no longer satisfies them, they'll burglarize homes and start taking the object that arouses them.
if they get away with that long enough, they become more confident.
then the object becomes the woman wearing it.
that's when a rape can occur.
the one constant is that they always take the underwear as a souvenir.
is it possible a pervert like this has ever been arrested?
there's a good chance a serial sex offender with an underwear fetish has been caught before.
right again, Agent Hotchner.
what is it, Garcia?
for the last two days， I've been searching through vices for similar rapes and murders in cases that are still open. That has yielded me diddly squat.
so I regrouped. I looked at some pictures of baby pandas.
I went back in and I started searching for similar rapes and murders in cases that had been solved. Ok?
what did you find?
five months ago this guy named Clint Barnes is convicted of 5 rapes
that have been 30 miles away in Selbyville.
now, what's interesting, and by interesting I also mean icky and sad and wrong,
is that Mr. Barnes only stole the undergarment of his last victim
and she was beaten in exactly the same manner as our current victims.
and she was the only one who died.
the first four showed no sign of torture?
according to statements made by the survivors, yes,
some questions about his performance, things like, "Did you enjoy it?"
that sounds like a power reassurance rapist.
that doesn't fit his last crime at all.
the last victim wasn't his.
it was our unsub's.
Ian! Ian! Stop! Please!
we need to clean your hand. - I'll be fine.
you're cut pretty bad. - I said I'll be fine.
Ian, what are you doing? - He got in here. There's got to be a way out.
OK.
just-- just slow down for one second. Ok?
we gotta get out of here! - I know, Ian
Abby? I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
Abby... I didn't mean it.
I know. I know you didn't mean it.
what's happening? - Ian.
just get us out of here. Now.
please.
the way out has to be in the bathroom.
files rushed over from the D. A.'s office.
how many suspects did they have in the Selbyville case?
let's see. Including Clint Barnes, says they had about 10 other men who looked good for it.
brought in double that for questioning.
JJ, cross-reference these names of suspects.
see if you get a match with people we still need to talk to in Sherwood.
you got it. - You can use my office.
almost all these guys had criminal records.
offenses range from spousal abuse, sex crimes, molestation and attempted rape.
our unsub is using brutal, physical force and extreme violence.
look for somebody who's angry and hostile towards his victims.
look for an intellectual component.
this guy used the M.O.of another rapist to make sure the wrong person went to jail for his crimes.
the Selbyville police talked to our unsub.
he looked good for these crimes.
he's in here somewhere.
you need to let us go. Now!
people are waiting for us.
if we're not home, they're going to call the police.
they have no idea you're here.
we told them we're staying in Sherwood.
that's not what Ian said when he checked you in.
what do you want?
I want to know why you are with a man who doesn't take care of you.
and then you let him push you around like that.
have you ever wondered what it's like to be with a real man?
all right, Garcia, let's try again.
go for it.
name's Floyd Henson.
lived and worked in Sherwood his entire life.
went to jail at 25 for breaking and entering.
our friend got caught red-handed with some bloomers.
charged with attempted rape.
jerk served time, got out a year ago.
his last known address is at the crest cottages.
JJ, the list of hotels and motels we went to.
I interviewed the manager there. His name was Dryden, right?
employee records say Wayne Dryden was fired from the crest cottages six months ago.
the only employee now is the owner...
let's go. I know where we're going.
JJ, tell Garcia we'll call her from the car.
Abby. Wake up.
honey, what'd he do to you?
I'm going to kill that son of a bitch.
he said he'll be back.
Abby, I love you.
I'm going to get us out of here.
do you hear me? Abby?
I should've taken my own advice and gotten some rest.
Hotch, we've talked to so many people. It could've been any of us.
Hello? Hello?
do you hear me, Garcia?
Yeah, that's better. I can sort of hear you.
so, like I was saying, it looks like Floyd Hansen didn't even have a chance.
his mother drank herself to death when he was two.
father remarried but to a prostitute.
Where's his father now?
he died six months ago.
Floyd inherited the crest cottages from...
Garcia? We lost her.
Hello? Reid? Oh, man.
timeline fits. He gets out of jail a year ago, he's on good behavior for a few months.
but the urges are too strong, rapes and kills a woman,
but he's smart enough to blame it on another guy.
his father dies, he inherits all the privacy, control and victims he could ever need.
it's loose.
I got one. Look, Ab. If I get one more...
no. Don't you do that. Don't you give up on me.
Abby, look at me.
you can do this.
we're going to do this. We're going to get out of here, Abby.
that would really be something.
cause that hasn't happened yet.
but this...
this always happens.
easy. Easy.
someone always gives up.
I got to say, I didn't think it was going to be you.
I mean, I get it. You're tired.
leave her alone!
you know, I heard you're not a morning person,
but what kind of man turns that down?
you didn't touch my pancakes so you must be starving.
and then there's him.
he's supposed to protect you.
isn't that the deal?
isn't that why you married a big, strong man?
so...
why did he just sit there the whole time?
you son of a bitch.
there are 10 cabins on 10 acres.
there are maps outside the office. He's got a lot of privacy.
there's a garage, there's the sheds, there's stables...
why not keep them in one of the cabins?
we're going to have to check everything.
we'll look in here. - Ok. Morgan Prentiss, this way.
he's been following the investigation.
he's been at this longer than we thought.
don't worry.
when I'm done with her, it'll take the fight right out of you.
morgan Prentiss, I'm at Cabin 6.
No!
he went through there. - Morgan!
there.
are you ok? Ian.
we need an ambulance Cabin 6.
is he ok? Is he ok?
he's going to be ok. - Ian.
thank you.
well, roadside motels definitely go on my list.
of things to never do again.
you've got a list? - You don't?
it's going to take a while to get this mess cleaned up.
well, it's going to take a hell of a lot longer for that couple to recover.
I wonder if this place was ever nice.
I was here. I talked to him and I didn't see it.
he made himself look like a good guy.
you bought it. It happens. To the best of us.
welcome to the club.
Roman poet Phaedrus wrote, "Things are not always what they seem."
the first appearance deceives many.
the intelligence of a few perceives what has been carefully hidden.
get 'em - Morgan, get 'em off me!
Reid. Reid. Wake up.
what the hell is scaring you?
the name Riley Jenkins mean anything to you?
no.
he was murdered right here in Las Vegas when he was 6 years old.
you would have been around 4 at the time.
he was found him in the basement of his own house, behind the dryer.
he'd been sexually abused and stabbed.
Spencer? What are you doing here?
did I know a boy named Riley Jenkins?
I've been having dreams about his death since I was little.
why aren't you helping me?
Spencer, pay attention.
show me your face.
dad.
Las VEGAS. NEVADA
come on, baby. Give it to me. Give it to me. See? Nuh-uh.
Morgan, can you...please, can you-- My head.
my bad. Sorry.
you know these things are rigged, right?
late night?
I hate Vegas.
come on, Prentiss. How can you hate Vegas?
this is a grown folk's playground.
anyone seen Reid?
I know he stayed with his mom last night.
well, he should be here by now. He knows the departure time.
JJ. I swear to god... - What?
Oh, here he comes right now.
What'd you do? Sleep through your alarm?
sorry to keep you guys waiting. I
Hotch is already at the airstrip. How fast can you pack?
actually, I'm gonna stay for a couple of days.
is everything all right?
Yeah, I just, um...I haven't seen my mom for a really long time, so I'd like a few more days.
you sure? - Yeah.
OK, take a few days. Do what you need to do.
Hey, um, take care of yourself.
you, too. Both of you.
Hi, I'm special agent Spencer Reid, with the FBI.
I'd like to see everything you have on the 1984 murder of a boy named Riley Jenkins.
just a second. - Thanks.
that was a rough one.
did you work the case?
Yeah. I was 3 or 4 blocks away when the call came in on the radio.
my first kid.
you don't forget those.
can I ask you this? Were there any suspects?
the family, initially. A dad, an older brother.
makes sense. I heard the boy was found in his own basement, right?
Yeah. After a while, the family got defensive, stopped cooperating.
a bit like the...what's her name? The Jon Benet case, I guess.
I never liked them for it, anyway.
I always figured it was somebody outside the home.
what's the bureau's interest in the case?
um, research.
is this everything?
there might be another box down in records.
I'd like to see it all, if you don't mind.
lots of luck, everybody, let's go.
nice shot!
what are you guys doing here?
Hey, what's it look like we're doing?
uh, breaking into my room and watching "Days of our Lives."
young and the Restless.
aren't you supposed to be on a plane back to D.C.?
you're supposed to be hanging out with your mom.
and you're not.
no, it's not... that's actually not why I'm here.
come on, man.
who do you think you're talking to?
I know what this has been doing to you.
let us help.
maybe together we can find out who killed him.
I think I might already know.
so, tell us about the suspect.
truth is, I don't know anything about him.
he's my father.
what was silent in the father speaks in the son, "and "often I found in the son the unveiled secret of the father."
freidrich nietzsche.
before we go down this road, you need to be sure.
he's right.
some rocks don't need looking under.
my mind is sending me signals. I can't ignore them anymore.
mixed signals.
that's what the subconscious is all about, you know that.
Reid, your dad left you.
you take it to the Freudian extreme, you could say that he killed your childhood.
could explain a dream in which you see him as a murderer.
I've come this far, I'm not going back.
OK, thank you.
Emily, you rember agent Todd?
Oh, yeah. Welcome back. Thanks.
I'll be shadowing JJ. For the next couple of weeks.
big shoes to fill.
big ankles, at least.
come on, you look great.
that's what I keep telling her.
do you have kids, too? Or
Ah, no. I think JJ. May have snared the last viable donor.
tell me about it.
donor for what?
nothing.
I'm just, uh, reacquainting agent Todd here with the layout.
good to see you again, S.S.A. Hotchner.
no, please. Hotch.
Hotch. So, where's the rest of the team?
Oh, another case came up while we were in Las Vegas, and they stayed behind to look into it.
excuse me.
I thought you work cases together.
this one's different.
Riley was 6 at the time.
his father, Lou Jenkins, was supposed to pick him up from T-Ball practice at 4.
but he got delayed at work, prompting Riley to walk the 3 blocks home.
when his mother got home in the early evening, she found him dead in the basement.
so, the offender came to the house after the boy arrived home.
or picked him up on the way there.
coaxes Riley into the basement where he sexually assaults him.
the boy's mouth was taped shut.
symbolic.
the unsub fears Riley will talk, panics, weighs his options...
decides to make certain that he'll never talk.
he finds a knife in the fishing gear under the stairs,
stabs Riley 9 times in the chest, stuffs him behind the washing machine.
so, the unsub's a white male in his late 20s to early 30s.
means we're looking for a man in his 50s.
likely knew the boy.
maybe been to his house.
neighbor.
Reid? What is it?
my family lived less than a half mile from the Jenkins'.
do you think your dad knew the boy?
I don't know.
my memory's lack of recall just reinforces how little I knew about him.
Reid, we're going to have to track him down.
you do know that?
we should talk to my mother first, neighbors.
get their impressions.
Reid, I don't need to tell you that this signature was need-based and sexual in nature.
the man we're looking for is a pedophile.
so, I'll ask you again.
are you sure you want to go down this road?
mom? Can I ask you some questions about dad?
I'm having... having trouble remembering.
what do you want to know?
did he like to be around children?
children?
well, yes.
if it were up to him, you'd have a house full of brothers and sisters.
so, you didn't want more kids?
why mess with perfection?
um, what about other people's children?
how was he around them?
he was good with kids, I guess.
he coached your little league team.
good hit. Yeah!
Hey, good hit, Riley.
Spencer, you're next.
he was always trying to put you into normal activities.
I tried to tell him you're not normal.
you were exceptional.
let me ask you this, mom.
did you ever get the feeling, like, on his part, the marriage was just for show?
these questions are very strange, Spencer.
what is this about?
it's about Riley Jenkins.
I told you, he was someone you made up.
no, he's not someone I made up.
he was a real boy who lived in our neighborhood, and somebody killed him.
and, i don't know, I think... I think that dad might have had something to do with it.
he was real?
Yes. And...
he was on that little league team, too.
so many cases. How do you determine which ones get priority?
Ah, basically murder triage.
I look for cases where the threat of losing another life is most imminent.
without the other agents giving you a working profile?
well, that comes later.
this job does require a little bit of profiling.
just don't tell them that.
here, let me show you.
OK, family in Atlanta, mother, twin daughters, stabbed in their sleep, and, uh...
Yeah, Sioux city, Iowa.
two men with no apparent connection both found drowned in their bathtub exactly one month apart.
where would you go?
I'd have to take a closer look.
what does your gut tell you?
Sioux city looks like a serial.
another victim could die within a month.
what about Atlanta?
that's a family annihilator.
father snaps, takes out the flock, puts any relative in the area in immediate danger.
I'd take the team there first.
good. Now, do that with that whole entire stack, right there.
you ok?
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.
it's just a theory, Mr. Jenkins.
you must be out of your damn minds.
we're trying to get some new facts.
well, you're hell and gone from facts if you think Will Reid killed my son.
so, you were friends?
who the hell are you to come here, asking this?
I'm his son.
Spencer, a G-man? How about that?
I don't understand.
was william around your house often?
the occasional barbecue, that sort of thing.
was Riley around on these occasions?
why are you doing this?
I need to know.
take it from someone who does know, he was a good man.
thanks for your time.
where is he, these days? My dad?
it's been years, but he's probably still at that same firm in Summerlin.
he's been in town this whole time?
far as I know.
you know Summerlin?
Yeah. It's like 9 miles east of here. Off the 95.
he was 10 minutes away and never let me know.
can I help you, gentlemen?
Yeah.
we'd like to speak with William Reid.
is he expecting you?
I don't think so.
he's in a meeting right now.
why don't you have a seat and I'll tell him you're here.
you ok?
Yeah. No-yeah-I'm going to go to the bathroom.
I've never seen him like this before.
17 years is a long time to go between visits.
not long enough. The kid's still angry.
Yeah, I'm starting to get that.
I'll be right back. Here you go.
you from the FBI?
Yes, sir. Mr. Reid, I'm agent Rossi. This is agent Morgan.
this wouldn't be about the city council investigation, would it?
no, this is, uh, more of a personal matter.
it concerns your son.
my son? Did something happen?
that's what we're trying to find out.
Hello, dad.
you don't look like me anymore.
you used to. Everybody said so.
they say some people look like their dogs, too.
it's attributed to prolonged mutual exposure.
elderly couples, also.
they unconsciously mimic the expressions of people they've been around their whole life.
so, it kind of- kind of makes sense that I wouldn't really look like you.
I haven't seen you in 20 years.
so, are you in town on work?
we're just wrapping up a case.
a 5-year-old boy was abducted and murdered.
I read about that. Uh, Ethan Hayes, right?
that's terrible.
that case got me thinking about Riley Jenkins.
you remember Riley Jenkins?
of course.
I've been having dreams about him for a really long time.
but when we came back here for this case, it jogged something and the dream changed.
I saw his killer and he was you.
interesting dream.
you don't seem all that surprised.
I stopped being surprised by Spencer's mind a long time ago.
there are certain criteria we consider when looking at this type of suspect.
you fit parts of that profile.
me?
we just want your cooperation.
my cooperat...
you're not actually saying you think I killed Riley Jenkins?
we didn't say that.
good, 'cause that's absurd.
we'd just like permission to look through your computer, access your records.
and what would you be looking for exactly?
you want access to my files?
get a warrant.
we can't get a warrant, so we have to go under the radar on this one, Garcia.
you want me to hack your father's network?
you sure about this?
I really wish people would stop asking me that.
you're...
Hey, you're pretty good.
was the envelope dropped off at the front desk first?
Nope, it went straight to my room.
so, they knew what room you were in.
I do have to admit, the timing of this is a little suspicious.
Yeah. An hour after I see my father, we're handed another suspect.
you think you knew this guy?
I don't know. I think so, but I'm not sure.
I...I...no, I don't know.
exposed himself to a minor.
that's a precursor to molestation.
and murder.
we should take a closer look at this guy.
it's Garcia.
Yeah, talk to me, baby girl.
I'm not interrupting boy time at Crazy Horse 2, am I?
you know that's not my thing.
I'm more for in-room entertainment.
I can't help you but I do give good phone.
let me hear what you got.
Reid, we've been all up in your father's business.
what did you find?
well, let me tell you first what I did not find.
no kiddie porn, no membership to illicit websites, no dubious emails, no chat room history.
what about his finances?
we went back 10 years.
no questionable transactions that we can find.
well, he did buy a ticket to see Celine Dion 6 months ago.
but I think we can overlook that.
he's smart. Is it possible he kept things under the table?
well, of course. But from what we can tell, Reid, he doesn't fit the profile.
we can tell you other things about him, if you want to know.
I'm listening.
he's a workaholic, he actually logs more hours than we do.
he makes decent money, but he doesn't spend a lot of it.
he has a modest house. He drives a hybrid.
he doesn't travel much. He stays away from the casinos.
um, and according to his veterinary bills, he has a very sick cat.
he appears to spend most of his free time alone, he goes to the movies a lot, and he reads.
and from his collection of first editions, it seems his favorite author is
isaac Asimov, I remember that one.
he does have one other major interest.
on his home computer, he's archived, like, a ka-jillion things on one common subject.
what?
you, kiddo.
he's got, like, everything that's been published online.
every article you've been quoted in, pieces you've written for behavioral science journals,
he even has a copy of your dissertation.
he's keeping tabs on you.
that's saying something.
Yeah, he googled me.
that makes up for everything. I'm going to get some air.
you guys still there?
I thought we were giving him good news.
what else can we do?
Yeah, look up a name for us, if you would.
you like this Gary guy for the Riley murder?
somebody does.
wow, looks like you got a loose one.
no such thing.
these machines run on random number generators.
no brains, no bias.
best odds in the house, though.
Really? I thought that craps had the best odds.
normally, video poker odds are slightly worse at 0.7 percent in your favor.
but if you employ optimal strategy and always drop with a royal flush,
you can push those odds to 2 percent.
smart and handsome.
so, are you in town for the convention?
um, there are 12 conventions in town this week. Which one are you talking about?
take your pick.
6 minutes.
excuse me?
um, it was something I used to say to my mom to try to get her to quit smoking.
a cigarette takes 6 minutes off your life.
so every time she'd light one, I'd say, "it's 6 minutes less that I get to spend with you."
did it work? - No.
because I've tried it all...the gum, the patch. Nothing works.
you should try hypnosis. They've had... there's been a lot of success in...
tell you what, I'll put mine out if you buy me a drink.
uh, not today, sweetheart.
we've been looking all over the place for you. Come on.
Hey, you won, like, $2, 000 here.
keep it.
you do realize you just gave two grand to a hooker?
must have been quite a conversation.
what was it about?
how to stop smoking.
thank you for seeing us on such short notice.
well, I'm always happy to assist the FBI.
is there a witness you want me to look at?
uh, yeah. Me.
I'm trying to recover memories from my childhood.
there was a murder.
how long ago are we talking about?
I was 4.
memories from that age can be difficult to interpret.
I'm aware of the limitations of hypnotherapy.
well, then you're aware of suggestion issues.
if you've looked into this case, you may have a bias.
are you saying what he remembers under hypnosis may not be real?
it's a possibility.
either way, it's a tough sell in court.
we won't be using this for evidentiary purposes.
it's really just for me.
the suppressed memories are about my father.
I'd like to monitor this session.
make sure you get him to the right place.
you want to sit in?
I don't normally allow that.
in case you haven't realized, nothing about this is normal.
I want you to hold my wrist in your left hand.
and if you should feel any fear, I want you to squeeze, do you understand?
Yes.
go back to the night you were just telling me about.
you're at home, in your room.
you can't sleep because your parents are arguing.
I don't know what to do. I had to do something, but I didn't know what to do.
I'm not going to discuss it anymore.
he's coming in. - Who?
I know you're awake, Spencer.
it's dad.
what about him, Spencer?
what is he doing?
daddy loves you, you know that?
I don't want to be here.
OK. It's ok, Spencer.
take us to where the light is.
to the next morning.
the sun is coming up.
where are you, Spencer?
mom? My mom. She's at the window.
she's thinking.
she's been crying.
she saw him.
who? Your father?
do you talk to her?
no. No, I wanna... I wanna see...
what is it, Spencer?
what are you seeing?
that's enough.
I need you to leave this location now, Spencer.
damn it. Wake him up.
I'm going to count backward from 5.
5, 4, 3, 2,1, and wake.
Reid. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok. It's ok, Reid. It's ok.
what happened? What did you see?
try to rember, mom.
no, I can't.
you were there.
you watched dad burn the bloody clothes.
you had a dream.
mom, this was not a dream. This was a memory.
it was a memory and I saw you.
your mind, ah, such a treasure.
even as a baby you knew about things you weren't supposed to know.
this is not about me. This is about Riley Jenkins.
it was always about you.
please, mom. Please. Please, just try to rember.
remember Riley.
Riley was real.
Oh, poor riley.
Yes, poor riley. Poor riley. Did dad do something to him?
dad? No. - Think. Think.
think. - No, no. That's...no, no.
now you're confusing me, Spencer.
you knew. You knew about dad, and you didn't do anything.
No! You don't know. No! No! You don't know! You don't...no!
No! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
no, no, no, no!
I'm just going to give you something to relax.
no.
it could have been you.
what? What did you say?
it could have been you.
she's not stable, Reid.
you can't put stock in what she says. I don't need to tell you that.
and I don't need to tell you this is textbook.
father reroutes compulsion to molest away from his own son to a surrogate.
the woman thought Riley enkins was an imaginary friend until you told her otherwise.
the mind's way of suppressing memories she doesn't want to face.
you're losing objectivity here, kid.
I'm not trying to say I know what happened.
or how my dad's involved, Morgan.
but my dad's involved.
what's he doing here?
you got no evidence.
a suspect can be detained for questioning for 48 hours, regardless of evidence.
I'm not in the habit of ruining people's reputations on a whim.
Where's your captain? I want to talk to your captain.
talk all you want.
this is a local murder, and your authority ends at the state line.
look...
why don't you just head back over to the fountain view
and have a couple of drinks by the pool and think about this.
I have thought about this.
the guy's your father.
what's your point, detective?
maybe you're here to work out some other issues?
OK, listen, detective.
if you helped us out with this.
we just want him on his heels.
you've got 24 hours.
I appreciate that.
you gotta keep your head, man.
he just agreed to it. It happens all the time.
you know how these guys are.
they just want to feel like they're the ones in control.
talk to me, Garcia.
so, this Gary Michaels you asked me to track down seems to have peeled himself right off the grid.
what did he do? Skip town?
feels it. Maybe he took a new name, too.
everything in his name laps from non-use in the year after the Riley Jenkins murder.
maybe he didn't want to stick around for the investigation.
in addition to the indecent exposure wrap, he also had some lewd behavior, trespassing.
trespassing?
at a nursery school.
hard to believe the cops never pegged this guy as a suspect.
any other avenues to find him?
you betcha. They swabbed him in '85 for the exposure beef,
so I'm sending up balloons through VICAP and CODIS.
if he's offended again over the past 20 years under a different name...
which, considering his type, he probably has...
he will pop up somewhere.
all right. Keep me in the loop.
later.
what's with the wincing? You ok?
fine.
are you sure? I noticed this earlier.
earlier? How often?
um, in the last hour. I'd say every 10 minutes.
JJ. Why didn't you tell anyone?
because I am not due for another 3 weeks.
newsflash! You're in labor.
no, no, no. Because Reid needs us right now.
you need you, right now. Come on, get up.
ladies and gentlemen, I'm not a doctor.
I don't even play one on TV, but I believe young JJ.'s going into labor.
are you ok?
I'll get the car.
I need to call Will. - From the car, honey.
breathe and walk. Breathe and walk.
agent Todd, I hope you're ready because your job starts right now.
you still think why shouldn't I?
well, for one thing, Gary Michaels fits the profile.
for another, he fled town after Riley's murder.
he's a better suspect than your dad, Reid.
he's a convenient one.
someone slipped the file under my door, Morgan. What am I supposed to think?
maybe they're trying to help.
maybe they're trying to protect him.
you're talking about someone helping to cover up the murder of a child.
who would do that?
do you rember how resistant detective Hyde was when I asked him to bring in my father?
so, what? You're accusing a cop now?
it was a police file.
it was a very old police file. Anybody could have accessed it.
he told me to go back to the fountain view, have a drink by the pool, and think about things.
you can't possibly still be mad about that.
I'm not mad. I'm confused.
I never told him we were staying at the fountain view.
CODIS REPORT MATCH CONFIMED
it's a simple question.
how did the blood get on the clothes?
I told you, I'm not going to talk without council.
if you don't have anything to hide, you don't need a lawyer.
Spencer, please. I'm not stupid.
I'm proud of you, you know that?
I'm not stupid either.
no. You've done a lot of good.
I mean, other people with your talents, they might have sought different opportunities.
the private sector.
my god, you could have made a fortune.
but you chose to help people.
I chose to study murders.
why do you think that is?
I didn't do this, Spencer.
why can't you believe me?
like you said, I do have special talents.
one of them is being able to tell when somebody is hiding something.
you're angry that I left.
and you're right to be.
you want to make it up to me?
tell me the truth.
I didn't kill that boy.
but I know who did.
how'd you know that?
that was the whole idea, wasn't it?
so, where is Gary Michaels now, dad?
Spencer, please. Forget it.
you don't want to go down this road.
everything's fine. We're checking her in now.
and I got a thing back from California on your CODIS query.
did they find Gary Michaels?
some of him.
he's dead?
they dug him up 7 years ago when some new construction broke ground in the desert.
whoever killed him was smart enough to bury him across state lines.
Vegas PD. never made the connect.
how was he killed?
judging from the fractures, they think he was beaten with something.
a pipe, maybe. - Or a bat.
bat?
maybe it wasn't Riley's blood on those clothes your dad was burning.
Sheriff's...
been rumors a body was buried up at the Barker Ranch for years.
on account of that's where Chuck Manson had his hideout.
when we dug this one up, we went ahead and had him typed.
thought maybe it could be related.
it's a good thing you did.
might never have ID.'d him otherwise.
so, why all the fuss over a dead pervert?
we think he may have killed a boy in Vegas over 20 years ago.
is that how he ended up in the ground? Revenge?
possibly.
it says here you have a fingerprint in evidence, lifted from the victim's broken glasses.
we ran it up the flagpole a couple of times.
nothing ever came up.
that was then. Now we have someone to compare it to.
a suspect?
well, we're going to want to run it through AFIS, too.
that's a lot of taxpayer dollars being spent to solve a public service murder.
if you ask me, the guy got just what he deserved.
he's right, you know.
we don't have to run this print.
of course we do. Whatever Michaels did, he deserved a fair trial.
Reid, you wanted to know if your father killed Riley.
all signs point to "no." you got what you need.
what I need is the truth.
if this print belongs to your dad, he could go away for a long time.
you're just determined to nail him, aren't you?
doesn't even matter what for.
if you don't want to run it, I will.
I'm told you're refusing medication.
I'm just holding off for a little while, if you don't mind.
you know what will happen.
tremors, panic, then the voices.
but before that, when the fog lifts, a window of clarity.
I really need that right now.
I can give you some latitude here.
just tell me why.
I want to remember.
Yeah, agent Morgan.
you did?
you're 100 percent certain?
OK. Thank you.
we're going to have to get an arrest warrant.
it was a match?
Yeah. But it wasn't your dad.
we got company. - What's he doing here?
we notified your captain about this, detective.
it's all legit.
I'm not trying to stop you.
I just want to be the one to bring him in.
it'll go easier.
he's my friend.
Yeah, we figured that much. You, Lou, my father.
you slipped us the michaels file, didn't you?
you were after the wrong guy.
but you knew who the right guy was all along?
and what Lou did to him.
there wasn't any evidence.
did you even look?
you want to link him up, go ahead.
but he rides in with us.
appreciate that.
who else was with you?
no one.
you're saying you killed Gary Michaels by yourself, all alone.
that's right.
and william Reid wasn't a party to this?
no.
you're lying.
I'm not lying.
he was burning bloody clothes. I saw him.
what makes you think Gary Michaels killed your boy?
he admitted it.
you beat a guy with a baseball bat, he's going to admit to a lot of things.
how do you know he was the right guy?
I know.
he approached another kid in the neighborhood.
Hey, you're pretty good.
and how do you know that?
I was told by a concerned party. - Who? Another parent?
mind if I play?
that's all I'm going to say on the subject.
who was it?
who was it? - Agent Reid?
do not interfere with this interrogation, detective.
this is not your case anymore.
Spencer, it was me.
I'd seen him around at your ball games, at the park.
you used to play chess there, do you remember?
you played with him once.
with Gary Michaels?
I didn't know that was his name back then,
but it wasn't unusual for you to play with adults.
and you'd win, too.
did he do something to me?
Oh, no. God, no. It never got to that point.
but when I saw the way he looked at you, I knew what he was.
I could just tell.
a mother knows.
Yes.
so, you told Riley's dad.
2 nights later, Lou called the house.
he was agitated.
he said he needed me to meet him.
is that him?
Yes.
his name is Gary Michaels.
he has a history.
history?
he's done things to kids.
how do you know?
you should go now.
what are you going to do?
go home, Diana.
I sat there. I couldn't move. It was like a dream.
that paralysis in the face of something terrible.
what happened after that?
it's ok, Diana.
go on.
at some point, I found myself walking towards the house.
Oh, my god. Lou, what did you do?
and the rest...
it's all dark after that.
you came home.
she couldn't talk at first.
but eventually I came to understand what had happened.
and I knew that nobody could ever know.
so, you never told anyone?
no, she could have been implicated.
and I had to protect her.
you were burning her bloody clothes.
but the knowing, you can't burn that away.
it changes everything.
is that why you left?
I tried to keep us together, Spencer.
I swear to you, but the weight of that knowledge, it was too much.
you could have come back.
could have started over.
I didn't know how to take care of you anymore.
when I lost that confidence, there was no going back.
what's done is done.
at least now you know the truth.
I was wrong about everything. I'm sorry.
I am, too, Spencer.
there is no refuge from memory and remorse in this world.
Gilbert Parker.
well, he looks just like you.
let's hope he grows out of that.
just as long as he doesn't inherit the accent.
is there room for one more in here?
Spence, hi.
welcome back.
Congratulations.
thank you.
how is it that I just went through 15 hours of labor and you look worse than I do?
don't be ridiculous. You look beautiful.
well, I could sure use some coffee. Anyone else? - Sure.
my treat.
you ok?
Yeah, yeah. You?
Yeah, yeah, you sure? 'Cause there's something I wanted to ask you, but it can wait.
what is it?
will and I were talking, and, um...
we want you to be henry's godfather.
I don't even know...I don't know... - here, do you want to hold him?
it's ok. Here you go. - Ok.
watch his head. There you go.
Hello, henry.
if anything should happen to us, it's up to you and Garcia to make sure this boy gets into Yale.
Yale. Yale? Do you want to go to yale, henry?
that was your godfather's safety school.
don't worry, I can get you into Caltech with one phone call.
atlanta, GEORGIA - I feel stupid. - You look amazing. Drink.
I'm going home. - No. Come on. It's just an off night.
at any moment, Mr. Right is going to walk through that...
Oh, my...
is he cute? - Better.
have a drink.
Vanessa Holden, age 25.
last Friday night, she was clubing with her sister.
a stranger, white male, roughly her age, picked her up.
they left the club at 1 a.m., went back to her place.
he forced her on her hands and knees.
and then he cut her open just below the stomach.
Yeah. Pretty rough.
the gutting causes the intestines to spill out.
you can survive for a few hours, actually even days.
postmortem indicates that he slit her throat at 5 a.m .
so he disemboweled her but didn't kill her for 4 hours.
he could be a sexual sadist.
Yeah, I thought so, too, but I found two priors from a year ago
prostitutes, actually, in motel rooms.
OK. So keep running with it.
why do you think this is the same unsub?
in Vanessa Holden's apartment, the following were discover
bleach, ammonia, trash bags-- all in a triangular pattern.
one year ago, motel rooms-- bleach, ammonia, trash bags
also in a triangular pattern.
he's cleaning up.
might be trying to hide his tracks.
could be a sign of remorse.
apologizing for the murder by minimizing the mess.
but there's one other commonality between both sets of murders.
bleach and ammonia were found under the victim's fingernails.
he's making them clean up their own murder.
it's the same unsub.
author Harlan Ellison wrote, the minute people fall in love, they become liars.
so if the unsub changed the victimology, does that make him organized or disorganized?
well, the prostitutes point one way, the club goes another.
the triangular arrangement of the cleaning supplies is interesting.
obsessive-compulsive?
might have been institutionalized.
this guy started with prostitutes-- a high-risk victimology.
took a year off, came back, killed a socialite.
no forced entry, no coercion of any kind.
exactly.
so how does our unsub go from loser of the year to Don Juan?
actually, as Byron interpreted him, Don Juan was an ironic reversal of sex roles.
and when-- th--that's about it.
something must have happened between the last prostitute and Vanessa Holden making him change his victimology.
could the unsub have known Vanessa?
it's unlikely. Sexual sadists attack anonymously.
they have to sever a personal connection and see their victims as objects to perpetrate this level of torture.
we have to build two profiles, then
one for the unsub who killed prostitutes, one for the unsub who goes to clubs.
we've never done that before.
Prentiss is right.
the victimology is so different, we'll treat them as separate unsubs and see what overlaps.
Reid, work up a geographic profile, focus on location of the murders.
Prentiss and Rossi, concentrate on the prostitutes.
jordan, Morgan, and I will go deal with Vanessa Holden.
Atlanta...
detective Harding?
agent Jordan Todd.
thank you for coming.
ssas Hotchner, Morgan, Dr. Reid.
how you doing? - How are you?
Hey, is there a DNA match between the unsub and the prostitutes?
we could run through VICAP just in case.
um, there's no DNA at all.
no prints, no fibers.
just like Vanessa, everything gets cleaned up.
pretty effective forensic countermeasure.
what about witnesses? Somebody must have seen something.
Oh, yeah. Lots of people.
so you have a sketch.
it's a little vague.
that's because of this guy's other countermeasure. Take a look.
so this guy right here, that's our killer.
it looks like a fedora.
so he's drawing attention to his face while simultaneously obscuring it.
it's called peacocking
the adornment of some sort of flashy affect to sort of try to distract witnesses.
so none of your witness statements agree?
"he had a mole" , "he didn't have a mole."
he had a gap between his teeth, no, his teeth were perfect.
detective, we're gonna have to have a sit-down with Ashley Holden.
she got the best look at the unsub.
well, I wish I could make that happen, but unfortunately,
the family has decided to stop cooperating.
why is that?
they won't say.
yesterday the mother would move heaven and earth to help find her daughter's killer.
today, no, thanks. I'll take care of this.
sugar, if they broke the law, that'd be one thing, but they haven't done anything wrong.
what about public record?
anything that might explain why the family shut down?
I've got scads of blog postings on them.
the Holdens were movers and shakers in the city.
and the nasty stuff follows the money.
like what?
the Holdens got what they had coming to them.
why did Ashley get her sister killed?
Yikes. how much to gut the slutty one?
could you forward those to me?
good afternoon.
I'm sorry you came all the way out here.
it's a waste of time. Ashley knows absolutely nothing.
and we want to get this behind us as soon as possible.
Mrs. Holden, we can't begin to fathom the loss you've suffered.
that's right. You can't.
but, um...
I lost my older sister in a car crash.
and it was really hard on our family because she was the responsible one.
she was the one that my mother always counted on to watch over us.
and when she died, my mother wouldn't let the police in.
if she didn't let them in, then my sister wasn't really dead.
this man is a monster, and we can catch him.
but we need your daughter's help.
if you accuse her of anything... - Ma'am
I will be on the phone so fast... - Ma'am, ma'am, we won't.
all right. Follow me.
did you know that about Jordan?
no, and neither did she.
according to her file, she's an only child.
Vanessa's boyfriend just broke up with her, so I took her out to, you know...
to have a good time. There's nothing wrong with that.
were you approached by anyone?
guys.
can you describe any of them for us?
ordinary.
look, Vanessa wasn't even in the mood.
so if she wasn't in the mood, if she left with this guy,
then there must have been something about him, something unique.
we saw a picture of him on surveillance, and we know that he was dressed like a rocker.
so he was pretty flashy, right?
what was the first thing you noticed about him?
his attitude.
what about it? Cocky? Confident?
or did he play it more the broody type?
he was like-- he was hitting on us, but he was, like, making a joke out of it at the same time.
seriously. You don't recognize me?
I will give you 3 more guesses.
you know, even his eyes, they were different colors.
so this guy wanted to be noticed.
Yeah. That's why you go to a club, right?
and then he had these games.
like, he would bet us drinks that we couldn't get his number.
or this other one.
there. ok. Let me make sure you didn't screw it up.
hmm, ok.
the camera really does add 10 pounds. - What?
you're so...
she didn't even want to go out that night.
I had to drag her to the club.
the last thing she said to me before I left her alone with that guy was, "I had the best time tonight."
the best time.
the information about Vanessa Holden being the responsible sister, where did you get that?
some of it was on-line, and some of it was just an educated guess based on birth order.
a guess. And in the process, you lied.
that mother was shut down. I needed to salvage some rapport.
I don't know how you did things in counter-terrorism,
but we don't make it a habit to lie to get the job done.
I got you in the door, didn't I?
not only do you represent the FBI, you represent this team
to the press, the police, and to the families who are struggling with some of the hardest times of their lives.
if you get caught in a lie, the trust we depend on to help solve these crimes disappears.
do I make myself clear?
it won't happen again. - No, it won't.
when we get back, I want you to prepare a press release about the unsub.
do not release it.
from now on, everything goes through me.
Yeah, Dave?
so how bad did I just screw up?
on a normal scale of 1 to 10, I'd say a 6, but on Hotch's scale, an 11.
the unsub killed the prostitutes in separate pay-by-the-hour motels in Fulton county,
right there in one of the poorer neighborhoods the area.
now, Vanessa Holden's apartment was in the peachtree district, where there's a lot of big money.
based on the geography, he isn't just changing his victimology, he's changed his whole tax bracket.
the high profile of Vanessa Holden bears that out.
by killing her, he was climbing the social ladder.
if that's the case, this unsub had a long way to climb.
both prostitutes advertised here. Look at their pictures.
subservient positioning, asking to be dominated.
promising to come to you?
that cuts out the social interaction of meeting on a street corner.
that's a long way from a self-assured unsub who hits the clubs.
except he took a year off between the murders.
maybe he took that time to change himself.
that's impossible. - Why?
well, I mean, you're talking about a total transformation here.
I mean how you talk, I mean how you dress, how you think about yourself.
difficult maybe. Not impossible.
he already started killing.
there must have been a secondary trigger that motivated him to change who he was.
so if you're gonna transform yourself, how would you do it?
a steady diet of self-help books.
start hitting the gym?
you have to learn how to read people.
I mean, what is a pick-up? It's basically just a profile.
decoding cues of interest and recoding similar ones.
if you're too obvious, you turn off your target.
if you're oblivious, your target moves on to a better profiler.
that doesn't sound like something he could do on his own.
no. He'd have to go somewhere to learn it.
Yeah. A self-help class maybe?
uh, wait a minute. Come on. An unsub who kills prostitutes.
is he really thinking about signing up for a Yony Robbins seminar?
he would if he found a class in the same place he found the prostitutes.
learn HOW TO PICK UP CHICKS
I like your style.
well, the preliminary autopsy came back. The victim's name is Becky Williams.
was she disemboweled? - No.
and what's even weirder is the cleaning supplies were set out,
but there was no traces of them on her body.
why would the unsub alter his signate and push her out of an 8-story window?
escalating to sadism maybe?
gutting and cleaning are what he has to do to find release.
he wouldn't change that.
well, why not? He's changed everything else about himself.
did anyone see the unsub?
no surveillance cameras at the club.
Becky's friends say she was talking to a guy with sunglasses.
sunglasses.
so why did he pull out the cleaning supplies and then not use them?
on all the other scenes, the bottles were arranged in a precise order.
here they're just part of the mess.
maybe she fought back. And when Becky went over the railing, his routine had been compromised because he knew the police would respond.
or she could have jumped.
her nervous system was pumping adrenaline.
her fight or flight response kicks in.
he struck two fridays in a row, and if his routine's been interrupted,
it might compel him to strike again.
it's saturday. The clubs will be packed tonight.
take a look at the classes the unsub might have taken.
we need to generate a suspect pool as soon as possible.
OK.
can detective Harding get a copy of the sketch to Garcia?
did you find anything outside?
no. But I think there might be a new pattern emerging.
Garcia, you ready? - Sending it now.
please be aware that 30 minutes with photoshop does not allow for much artistic flourish.
both times the unsub has gone to a club, he's had some costume, but now there's a theme
a fedora and colored contacts, sunglasses, each time obscuring
are you ready, Garcia?
this area.
now, yes, maybe he's trying to draw attention to him,
but maybe he's trying to draw attention away from here.
something he knows is identifiable-- a birthmark or a scar maybe.
we need to get these out. Jordan, release these to the press.
which is why we're encouraging women to be on the lookout for this man.
he has been seen at club omega, suffragette city.
and we believe he may be attending similar nightclubs in the midtown district.
he may have a scar or a birthmark on his left eye.
based on witness descriptions and captured images, the suspect is white, mid-to late 20s, and I repeat, - he may have a scar or a birthmark... - Hotch.
what did you find out?
of the 20 self-described pickup artist classes in the area,
there's only one guy who encourages his students to dress like, uh, space cowboys.
are you ready to meet viper?
men are put on this earth to hunt women.
and even though women deny it, they want to be hunted.
they need it.
it's part of our biological imperative as animals.
and the competition the opposite sex puts you through
pitting you against other guys, against your own friends even,
it's all to reassure themselves that they have brought home the best possible mate.
it's just like you.
they want someone who's gonna make their eyeballs roll back in their head.
my job is to help you slash past every defense, every excuse, every, "why don't you meet my friend" trick that they're gonna throw at you.
you may not have ripped abs or afford table service, but if you're smarter and...
more interesting, then you will be a better predator, because this is the jungle, my friends.
and your prey wants to be caught.
will you listen to that language?
he's training serial killers. - Great.
we're dealing with a rampant narcissist and misogynist who's turned himself into a snake oil salesman.
that's one more thing he has in common with our unsub.
so you think this-- what did you call him-- unsub took my class - he copied your "the camera adds 10 pounds" routine verbatim.
Yeah. That's a good gag.
if you could just give us your atndance lists, it might help us find him.
no. - No?
my clients expect a certain amount of confidentiality.
I won't compromise that.
we can come back with a warrant.
be my guest.
but keep in mind, the money I make doesn't just pay for my fabulous lifestyle,
it also keeps some very expensive lawyers on retainer.
what club did you go to last night?
it's a legitimate question.
you seem to know a lot about our investigation.
two things to learn about me
first I outwit alpha males like you for fun and sometimes profit.
how often do you have to rely on your badge to score, baldy?
second, last night, I was at club Aqua,
and I have a stack of tax-deductible drink receipts to back up my story.
now, you might not want to believe that my style works.
and here in this harsh light, you have the advantage.
but meet me on my turf...
if you, um, have any questions, give us a call.
please tell me we are not giving up on that guy.
we're just getting started.
H--he actually said that? To Prentiss?
Yes, he did. So what can you tell me about him?
I can tell you the viper's real name is Paul Thomas.
and before he rechristened himself, he had a major mullet going on.
Garcia, we need the names of all of his students.
I'm gonna need a couple hours for a work-around.
I also need you to send Reid everything you can about what this guy teaches.
I think the unsub's using one of his routines.
we need to start building a linguistic profile.
sir, does this guy's stuff actually work on real breathing girls?
why are you asking me?
well, fortunately, Garcia, you're one of the exceptions.
well, be still my bespeckled heart. So are you, sir.
Thanks.
Hotch, this is Melissa Foster. She recognized the sketch.
I'm SSA Hotchner thank you for coming in.
you sure you've seen this man?
Yeah. I gave him the scar.
did you meet him in a club?
no. I was a prostitute.
this happened about a year ago.
and I was in bad shape. - Heroin?
but you got clean.
my girl, Cheryl, told me if I put an AD in the paper,
it'd be safer than walking the streets. So...
one day you got a call, right, to meet you at a motel?
Yeah.
when you walked in, you knew you were in trouble.
he couldn't meet your eye.
he was, um, kind of shifty maybe?
he paced.
I spent the first half-hour trying to get him to relax,
because if he can relax, then I can relax.
but he just wanted to rant.
what did he say?
he said I was the help.
they don't even see you. You're nothing. The help.
I had customers like this all the time.
they work out one of two ways.
either they want to tie you up, and you just say no or they want to be tied up,
in which case you do it and, uh, you steal their wallet.
he didn't want to tie you up, did he?
no.
you know what I remember about the whole thing, like crystal clear?
it wasn't the pain that sent him running.
it was the mess.
there's no record of your attack-- police, hospital. Nothing.
why didn't you come forward?
I wasn't ready to kick it yet.
I was this close to dying for two weeks.
and when I got back on my feet, I realized...
you just didn't want to live like that anymore.
if he hadn't attacked me, I would have died.
he saved my life.
our unsub is a confident alpha male.
he is white. He's between the ages of 25 and 30.
he's in excellent physical shape to overpower women and also to feed his self-image.
he has an obsession with cleaning.
he probably works in some service industry, wiping up after others,
convinced everyone looks down at him.
his change in himself and his victimology reflects that.
this is the kind of guy who wants to stand out in a crowd.
he's taken a class in how to pick up women.
so he'll repeat a series of well-rehearsed lines and mind games.
he may be uneducated, but he's by no means stupid.
taking this class has given him the ability to read verbal cues and body language.
one classic routine the viper promotes is called the push-pull.
he'll insert himself between two women and immediately after complimenting one,
he'll deliver a subtle insult, then pay attention to the other.
those are really nice earrings. I like those.
Thanks.
my grandmother wears a lot of fake jewelry also. It looks nice.
ignoring the one man puts her in direct competition with her friend
and causes the other to pursue you more aggressively.
I was just demonstrating. So I'm sorry.
well, we've mapped the hot spots he hits.
and he frequents the same clubs that the viper does,
so we need eyes and ears in every single one.
circulate the sketch as widely as possible.
we'll need everyone aware that there's a killer out there.
thank you very much.
I think I might just stay home and man the tip line tonight.
clubs aren't really my thing.
not a chance, kid. I need a wingman. Come on, now.
actually, there is another angle we need to pursue.
we still don't know what made the unsub change his victimology,
what made him stop killing prostitutes and move into the clubs.
the answer might be something in viper's class,
but to figure that out, we need to profile the teacher.
you need to bait him, then, with someone he sees as a challenge.
we need to study his style up close and personal.
it's gonna take someone that he's already attracted to.
Oh, this is really gonna suck.
Prentiss? - Yeah. Come on in.
Hey, I'm 10 minutes away.
you're ok with this, right?
Yeah. I'll be fine.
sadly, I've actually dated people worse than viper.
is something going on with Jordan?
um, you asked me to keep an eye on her.
and, frankly, I've noticed some tension.
I caught her in a lie.
she cut a corner to get us in with the Holden family.
did she misrepresent the bureau?
she misrepresented herself.
so how long is she gonna be in the doghouse?
until she proves she's competent.
that's gonna be tricky if you're scrutinizing her every move.
Prentiss, you seem to do ok.
I think in order for Jordan to prove she's good at this job,
it's not gonna happen under a magnifying glass.
you're gonna have to give her the opportunity.
you have something in mind?
when you think about the nature of serial crimes, it's amazing there aren't more predators in the clubs.
I mean, excessive amounts of alcohol, countless opportunities for date rape drugs,
not to mention surprisingly risky behavior being pursued.
all right. So who wants a flier?
nobody? Ok. All right.
so how's it going? - Not good.
I gave the profile to one woman, she asked if I was the unsub.
how are you doing? - Well, I gave out all my fliers.
how many phone numbers did you get?
none. I'm working a case here, kid.
OK, 4 were offered, but I didn't take any of them.
all right. Look, let me school you real quick.
what you have to do with these ladies, just take control of the conversation.
when you're talking, what makes you feel like an expert?
uh, statistics.
no. Trust me. No. Something else.
um, well, when I do magic. - See? See, that's perfect.
chicks dig magic.
I'm gonna give you a chance to work it. Come here.
excuse me, sweetheart. Whenever you get a chance.
what can I get you?
we're with the FBI. We're looking for this man.
does he look at all familiar to you?
it's not much of a picture.
I know. You know what might help, actually, is he has a scar on his eye right about there.
we also know that he's taken classes where he's learned how to distract and charm his victim.
OK. How did you do that?
that's privileged information.
so what do I do if I see him? - You should call us.
even if you just think you see him, you should definitely call us.
and if I don't see him... Can I still call you?
Yeah. Yeah. You can call me. Yeah.
OK. Cool. Wait. I don't have your number.
Oh, it's behind your barrette.
Bye.
see? There you go. That's what I'm talking about. That's called game.
that's an excellent question.
once you know a chick is interested, how do you proceed?
allow me to demonstrate.
this is a nice surprise.
well, the Atlanta P.D. and the FBI are combing all the bars you go to.
and it looks like I pulled the short straw.
lucky me, then.
so... why do you do it?
why do you teach guys how to be somebody they're not?
because it's a game, one I'm good at.
and I want to help other guys get good at it, too.
so...
affection, sex, emotional commitment. That's all just for fun, huh?
no. The fun is in the initial spark.
it's that thing a guy does in the first 5 seconds that makes you go... him.
what you're talking about is a different beast.
you can't fake it. You have to want it.
now, why are you really here?
is, um, this the guy you were telling me about?
viper, meet SSA Jordan Todd from the B.A.U.
jordan, this is viper-- god's gift to women.
God sure has a sense of humor.
you brought a friend.
you promised if i met you on your turf, you'd show me something special.
so let's see it.
Yeah, viper, who gets pushed and who gets pulled tonight?
is this the one that if you stare at it long enough, you see the image of a swan?
I'm just wondering if we missed anything.
remember, I said there was a secondary trigger.
we never found it.
maybe it's something that came from the class. Prentiss could still
what he took from the class brought him to Vanessa Holden,
but I'm talking about something much deeper psychologically.
think about this.
this unsub always goes to his victim's apartments.
never his own place. Why is that?
well, there must be some restriction there.
a nagging girlfriend, a crying baby maybe, some reminder of how miserable his life is.
which he's taking out on his victims.
you see, eye contact is a very powerful gauge.
it's why you tend to look away from someone you're attracted to
because you know instinctively what a dead giveaway it is.
but your brain goes there anyway.
images, fantasies.
don't flatter yourself.
the eyes don't lie. They dilate.
it's a chemical response. We can't control it.
OK, 15 seconds. What do you see?
Nope. No change. No dilation.
I guess chemically we're not a match.
only because you have someone else on the mind.
once that happens, the attraction center in the brain shuts down.
your turn. - No.
are you scared I might be right? Yeah?
no, Paul, I'm baffled.
I cannot figure out what the unsub could have learned from you.
what do you mean? He took my look, my words, everything that makes me successful to the opposite sex.
Really? Because that guy can get beautiful women into his apartment.
I wouldn't let you on my facebook page.
Oh, you're on facebook? - Yeah.
you should friend me. - I will.
I gave him the routines that made him what he is.
cause we've been watching all the women in the club.
and not one of them has looked at you.
so who do you really go home with, Paul?
or--or do you go home alone?
that was really good, ladies. That was really good.
don't you think I know why you're here?
one of my students copies my moves, and you're here to get inside my mind.
don't you see?
I confronted my queen bee a long time ago.
what's a queen bee? - You are.
and so is every other confident girl in here who's loud when she's drunk.
the social butterfly, the alpha female.
every student who's ever taken my class has had one in his life.
and the first exercise my students have to complete is to confront their queen bee.
it could be the girl who cheated on you or the prom date who stood you up.
but you find them and squash them.
our unsub knew Vanessa Holden.
how do you know?
it's viper's first confidence building exercise.
find the source of your first rejection and make her pay for it.
that's why he stopped seeing prostitutes.
he took viper's class and decided to confront Vanessa Holden.
it makes sense with what he said to Vanessa that night.
don't you know who I am? Look closer.
he meant it literally.
we need to talk to the family again.
so what you're saying is that you think my daughter knew her killer.
it would have been someone that she possibly met at a young age,
maybe a boyfriend, someone she rejected.
no. Vanessa told me about all her boyfriends.
how about someone who expressed himself sexually to Vanessa?
it would have been awkward, embarrassing.
and he would have had issues with cleanliness or cleaning.
what is it?
that woman who used to clean for us, the one who brought her son.
who was she?
I don't remember her name.
there have been so many people through this house,
but I remember when she brought this young boy in.
he was odd. - How?
he was inappropriate.
he would hide in the closet and then watch.
I caught him one day with Vanessa.
what are you doing in here?
WE--WE--WE weren't doing anything.
he made me.
you are coming with me. Get over here.
and what did you do?
I did what any parent would do.
do you understand what you did?
do you know what you did?
that's for talking to her... and that's for this.
don't you ever do that again. Don't you ever.
mom!
well, don't look at me.
that boy had no sense of boundaries whatsoever.
he needed to be taught a lesson.
do you happen to have any records of the employee, the mother?
no. Everyone got paid in cash.
Bobby. His name was bobby.
Vanessa called him a pervert.
I fired the mother that day.
it was awful, but there's a service that I remember that I used to get my domestics from.
it was in Fulton county.
last call, people! Last call.
see, your loveline's broken up, which means you haven't found your soul mate yet.
well, that's true. - Yeah.
it's really amazing. You see it in these couples that are together forever.
the lines on their palms change, so they--they become mirror images of each other.
Really? - Really.
why don't we--why don't we get out of here?
and I can tell you more about it.
what the hell?
I'm sorry.
Hey, you were holding on to me kind of tight.
we're leaving.
you know what? I have some club soda in the back if you want to clean that up.
Yeah. Yeah. Why don't you let me do that?
just, uh, right back here.
I need you to stay right here, ok?
who is that guy?
come on. Come on. Come on.
the bouncer saw Austin go out the back. She likes to smoke back here.
well, based on the witness' description, it definitely sounds like the unsub was here.
we got UNIS at her apartment, but no one's home.
Hey, it's Austin. Leave a message. - It keeps going straight to voicemail.
maybe we could have Garcia try to triangulate where she is based on the cell phone.
he has her.
when you asked him if he practices his routine on a sex doll,
I almost lost it.
you know, as much as I hate what that guy stands for,
I still read "five ways to get noticed" in "Cosmo" magazine.
because it makes sense.
Emily, thanks for doing this.
Absolutely.
I need you both out here. The unsub's kidnapped another victim.
Garcia, you've got Viper's attendance records?
got it. I'm ready to play the player.
start with Robert. Narrow down the permutations. Bob, Bobby.
that gives us 23 suspects.
do you have access to birth records? - Yeah.
pull the mothers' names and cross-reference with work and home addresses in Fulton county.
hold on. Bingo.
robert C. Parker lives at 932 Pryor street.
Oh, Pryor's 5 miles from here.
let's go. Jordan, have SWAT meet us at the site.
you made a mess, and now you're gonna clean it up.
clean it up! Clean it up!
clean it up!
clean it up!
faster. Faster.
you heard me saying "faster"?
first team in position.
I'll do--whatever you say you want me to do, I'll do it.
I'll do it. Ok.
the help... Doesn't talk.
stay there. Stay there.
get this off. Get it off. Get it off.
OK. It's ok.
I called you. - I know. I know. I know.
I called you.
let's go.
please, please, please.
who's that? Some... Somebody out there?
who are you? What do you want?
Mrs. Parker?
Where's Robert? Where's my son?
everything's gonna be ok. We're gonna get you some help.
no. Please. I need Robert.
I need to be changed.
he's just outside, ma'am.
it's a dialysis pump.
it was issued 10 months ago.
we found our secondary trigger.
P.J.O'Rourke wrote, cleanliness becomes more important when godliness is unlikely.
come in.
my report. - Thank you.
Prentiss said you were excellent in the field.
astute, responsive. You thought well on your feet.
she's being generous. I really enjoyed working with her.
you also posited early on that Vanessa Holden might know the unsub.
well, he didn't fit the profile of a sexual sadist.
and you were right.
clearly, our unsub was more complicated than the profile.
anyway, I just wanted you to know that you have the green light again.
and I trust your judgment. - Thank you.
how are you feeling? - Great.
I told my HMO I got abducted by a serial killer, so they gave me free dental x-rays.
I'm glad your stay at the hospital wasn't too terrible, then.
Ah, my doctor gave me a clean bill of health.
he told me I could even go back to work if I wanted to.
all righty. Back to bartending. All right.
no. I quit that job.
my recent brush with death has inspired me to pursue a different career.
well, that's--that's very exciting news.
what's, um--what is the new job path?
uh, well, I was thinking about taking up magic.
have you opened the package yet?
what is this?
is this your card?
Yeah. It, uh, it is my card.
cool.
Phoenix, ARIZONA
he's too damn old.
overweight, overpriced.
too damn old.
what, so you're saying they should have kept Marion?
that's exactly what I'm saying.
Marion, Nash, Stoudemire.
well, that's a team.
Yeah, same team that couldn't even makes it past the first round.
what is it?
where are we? - What?
I'm asking you, where are we?
I don't know. Sixth and... Buckeye?
wrong. We were on Sixth 8 blocks ago.
well, so what? What are we doing back here?
we're learning.
now, where are we?
I don't know.
you've got to know.
you always, always have got to know where you are.
I mean, let's just say you jump out of the car and run after some maggot.
this thing can't help you.
back-up will wind up at the car 5 blocks away.
won't do you much good, now will it?
no, sir.
don't sir me. Sir's for the academy.
I'm your partner.
Yes, sir--uh, right.
four-fifteen frank, 4129 23rd avenue.
repeat, four-fifteen frank in progress at 4129 23rd.
that's domestic violence. Tell them we're on it.
uh, copy that.
damn it. My flashlight.
are you kidding me? Hurry up!
hold it!
Oh, my god! Officer down, officer down!
copy that, officer. What's your 20?
we're at 23rd street!
officer?
back-up is on the way.
all units, 4129 23rd avenue...
earlier this evening, the Phoenix police force lost two of our own.
sergeant Manuel Rodriguez and Officer Thomas Kayser were killed in the line of duty.
that's 3 officers in the past 4 days.
after the first shooting, the Phoenix police department assumed gang involvement.
pretty reasonable assumption.
true. Almost 30% of all officer slayings are gang related.
technically it's closer to 40%.
if a cop isn't killed during a commission of a crime, gang involvement is highly likely.
actually, their precinct commander believes it may be a serial and has asked for our help.
what makes him doubt the gang theory?
a couple of things.
last night's victims were killed exactly the same way as the first.
shot in the neck.
something that the press didn't release.
well, now, wait. There could still be a gang behind this.
killers working together could establish the same M. O.
commander Marks hasn't ruled it out, but there's another detail.
trophies. Killer took their badges.
gang members don't usually take trophies.
they don't need to.
this is an unsub with something to pre.
and he's got the entire city on edge.
kill those who protect and serve, and no one feels safe.
ayn Rand.
go ahead, Garcia.
OK, while you birds have been in the air, I got the 411 on the first shooting.
apparently every Saturday night, Phoenix P. D. sets up a DUI checkpoint.
is that common knowledge?
public awareness is part of the deterrent.
so our unsub blows past said checkpoint at 90 mph,
and is pursued by an officer Jason Kessinger.
kessinger pulls the car over, approaches the driver's side window,
where he is shot in the throat.
he was a single parent, 2 daughters.
so, the unsub planned ahead, used the DUI stop to set his trap,
and then lured the officer to his death.
it could have been personal.
the unsub might have had a problem with these particular officers.
or with law enforcement in general. He's sending a message.
criminals, gang members, academy washouts, security rent-a-cops, teenagers, and that's just a start.
I mean, the list of people who have a problem with police officers is a long one.
the victims were shot in the neck, so the unsub knew they'd be wearing body armor.
and he used a DUI checkpoint.
I mean, both incidents show an active understanding of police procedure.
which narrows it down to anybody who watches television.
we need to cover victimology.
Garcia, find out everything you can about the officers killed.
see what they had in common besides their uniforms.
will do, but I should warn you, it will not be cake.
because I have been on the phone with these guys all morning,
and pulling files from them has been like pulling molars.
is there a problem?
you know, aside from the obvious grief for their fallen comrades,
and their fear of being used as target practice,
I get the distinct impression from their crabby behavior,
they are none too pleased their boss is outsourcing this investigation to the FBI, so...
be prepared to hit a blue wall of resistance.
commander Marks, I'm SSA Hotchner. This is Agent Todd.
agents Rossi Prentiss Morgan, and Dr. Spencer Reid.
thank you for inviting us. - And thank you all for coming.
although I'd like to have a word if you don't mind.
of course. Excuse me.
uh, Lieutenant Evans.
lieutenant Evans will answer any questions the rest of you may have.
I'll call you later. This way.
sorry, that was Officer Kayser's wife.
they'd only been married a couple of months.
she seems to think that the FBI is here to save the day.
is that what you're going to do, agents?
I apologize.
it turns out I may have wasted your time.
ballistics came back. Both 0.357 magnums, but not a match.
looks like we're talking about 2 different shooters after all.
we don't think so. - Really?
well, everyone here is pretty convinced this is the beginning of a gang war.
no, I understand that you could see it that way,
but we believe that the shootings are indicative of a single killer,
one who's not a gang member.
you're saying one shooter, multiple weapons.
both attacks were detailed, well planned out traps, not typical for a gang hit.
and the trophy taking suggests serial pathology, as well.
all right, look, I know I called you guys in, but I am way out on a limb here.
my officers feel like it's a betrayal, like I don't trust them to find this son of a bitch.
I gotta get this settled fast before this whole department comes unglued.
look, I get it.
we're only here to help and not hijack the investigation.
but if our theory is correct, the unsub's already looking for another excuse to kill again.
see, this is twelve's territory.
and you think they're behind this? - Does it matter?
Yes, it matters to us, lieutenant.
you know this city and its gangs better than we do.
we'd like to hear your theories.
OK, twelves has a captain.
street name playboy. Vice broke up a drug ring.
shot his brother, d.o.a. playboy thought he would kill us all.
well, it is pretty strong motivation, but your commander said the dash cam only showed one attacker.
most bangers will bring some back-up just in case.
well, playboy runs the toughest crew in town.
he's not "most" bangers.
well, you said the dash cam only showed one attacker.
why show your face at all?
because he had to.
he wanted to take them both out at the house, but they broke protocol.
rodriguez approached the house by himself.
wait a minute. Are you telling me they screwed up?
no, lieutenant, I'm saying that they split up, forcing the unsub to take them out separately,
one here at the house and one at the car.
that front unit's empty.
he could have set himself up there and waited.
choice of neighborhood was deliberate.
neighbors around here are used to hearing gunfire.
they'll blame it on the gangs, and so will the police.
techs have gone over this frame by frame.
there's no way to identify the shooter.
approximate height and weight, that's about all we got.
the unsub's face isn't the only way to identify him.
we also look at specific behavioral traits.
these are the reasons you don't believe it's a gang?
the shooter established what we call a signature,
something he did during the murders that wasn't actually necessary.
not part of his M. O. but identical in every attack.
in this case, the unsub took the officer's badges.
he's symbolically stripping them of their power and authority.
this act is indicative of someone who is looking to gain self-esteem.
gang members and other assailants who work together kill for different reasons,
but usually it's not to gain confidence, 'cause they already have it.
Hotch, you see that? Can we pause this?
OK, now zoom in and press play.
taking the badge would have taken a few seconds.
he's lingering. - Doing what?
that's a good question.
at least now, everyone with force knows he's out there.
it'll be harder for him to lure someone into his trap.
well, not necessarily.
being a cop is always dangerous, but even with the extra back-up and rover cars added to the shifts,
Phoenix P.D. 's still going to have to do their job.
which means walking into a potential ambush every time they take a call.
245 in progress, 106 East Broadway Road.
repeat, 245, report of an aggravated assault.
copy that.
behind the car.
Oh, yeah.
looks like a couple of bums. - Yep.
Hey, police!
clear out of here!
I got it!
son of a bitch!
officer down, 106 East Broadway Road.
copy that, officer, calling for back-up.
1099, code 2. Repeat, 1099, code 2, 106 East Broadway Road.
car 5-1, back-up is on the way.
car 5-1, I repeat, back-up is on the way.
thank you.
he set us up.
we knew he was out there, he still managed to set us up.
I'm sorry.
I watched my partner die, and I couldn't do anything to save him.
don't worry, Ron.
playboy's going to pay for this.
you saw playboy there?
no, but-- - we all know he did it, agent.
no, we don't.
lieutenant, you think I don't know how bad you want this guy?
I was a uniform just like you.
I saw a lot of cops go down.
before that, I watched my father got shot.
he was killed doing his job, a cop's job, so don't think I don't know.
officer Mercer, what happened when you got the call?
nothing special.
report of an aggravated assault.
we were on it.
this your regular beat?
we were additional tonight, added because of the shootings.
did you get a look at the guy?
nothing. I was too damn scared. I'm still scared.
you're not the only one.
my partner's family.
what am I going to tell them?
the only thing you can tell them-- that we're going to catch the guy who did this.
but the right guy.
anything?
we can forget cross referencing.
these guys were just assigned this beat.
there's no way the unsub could have known they'd get the call.
he's using the 9-1-1 calls like a lottery.
he's picking cops at random.
and yet there's nothing random about the shootings.
each scenario has been increasingly complex.
he's enjoying the hunt.
taking the time to set his victims up and luring them into his net.
it's become as important to him as the kill itself.
and this last one he executed while the FBI and every cop in the city was after him.
and the press... Their attention's feeding him.
playing right into the unsub's need to feel superior.
the press is not our only problem.
these guys are still trying to pin the shootings on a gangbanger named playboy.
I have a feeling we're not going to be able to hold them off much longer.
Hello, playboy.
what the hell, man?
let's go spend some quality time together.
time for what?
whatever you got, I didn't do it. - Yeah.
lighten up, man. I'm telling you, I didn't do it.
yeah? Well, I got a magic eight ball that says you did, playboy.
commander, what's going on?
what's going on is my officers are being shot in the streets and crucified by the press.
that's what's going on.
so you've arrested the wrong person?
I brought in a viable subject for questioning.
I had to do something.
I didn't kill no cop. Period.
sure, playboy.
just cross your heart, and we're done.
commander, I understand the pressure you're under,
but doing this could undermine the investigation.
bringing in another suspect draws attention away from the real unsub.
if he starts to feel inadequate, he may strike sooner just to prove himself.
it's also possible accusing one of their members could antagonize local gangs,
which is the last thing your officers need to be worrying about right now.
all right, look. I told you guys I was out on a limb here, so unless you have a suspect...
since we've got this guy, why don't we see if we can use him?
you mind if I talk to him?
be my guest.
commander, I appreciate your letting Agent Morgan join the interrogation,
but I promise you, this is not our unsub.
the real killer's still out there.
I know you didn't do it, playboy.
so why you dragging my ass in here, then?
I said I knew you didn't kill those cops, but he doesn't.
and they don't. And trust me, they don't care, man.
but you do. Oh, you care about me.
I don't give a damn about you.
tell you what I do care about.
catching the killer.
I told you, I didn't do it.
but I think you know who did.
no way, man. It wasn't one of us.
OK. I'll give you that.
whoever did do this ain't no banger.
but he's been working your hood pretty tough, though, huh?
without your say.
he's making you look real suspect, playboy.
causing you nothing but trouble.
he won't last long, then.
come on, man, look around you.
from where I'm sitting, it looks like he's doing all right so far.
I mean, if I'm you, I'm thinking I want this guy gone for good. What you think?
Yeah.
you know so much. Who is he?
probably somebody you'd least suspect.
probably wouldn't even think twice about him 'cause he really doesn't look all that dangerous.
well, at least not on the surface.
but he gets real violent.
well, we all violent. - No, no, no, not like this, man.
this cat goes from cold to hot in a heartbeat, nothing in between.
takes everything real personal.
thinks everybody's trying to put him down, so he's always looking for a fight,
even if he knows he's going to lose.
so he's stupid. - Maybe.
but he's aggressive. Think, man.
you give me something, maybe I get you out of all of this.
he's white. He's older than you, not by much.
and he works alone.
you know somebody like this, I know you do.
there was this guy...
he was white.
he killed my lieutenant a couple of months ago.
Bobby Q. - Yeah.
he was like my brother.
Yeah, your brother was a junkie, so was Bobby Q.
I see the similarity.
sit down, sit down!
don't even think about it. Talk to me.
forget him. I'm helping you, he's not.
all right. Your lieutenant, Bobby Q.
what happened?
well, I told the cops it wasn't a gang thing. They didn't believe me.
Yeah, that's 'cause you always tell us the truth, don't you, playboy?
I'm serious, man.
playboy, don't do it.
so who killed him?
if I knew his name, he'd be dead already.
there's been another shooting.
I'll cut him loose. - No. Not yet.
Hotch, this guy knows something.
all right, keep working on it.
they have the shooter cornered in an apartment building downtown.
Dave, stay with Morgan, see what this guy has to offer. Prentiss, you're with me.
he's in there? - Yeah, we got him cornered.
men on both floors and the entrances.
you know this guy? - Yeah, a banger called diablo.
he's one of the Lindo park assassins. Daws followed him here.
he all right? - He'll live. He's a lucky bastard.
we'd like to talk to Daws, if you don't mind.
all right, ok, stay down.
sergeant Daws.
I'm special agent Emily Prentiss, this is SSA Hotchner.
what happened?
he killed my partner.
we're sorry.
we were stopped at a light.
bastard came right up to the window.
shot scotty in the head, then shot me.
wait a minute. - There was no radio call?
no. Came out of nowhere.
guess he thought he'd bagged us both. Luckily, a truck came. He ran.
I called it in, managed to tail him here.
OK, thank you, sergeant. - It doesn't track.
no, it was a blitz attack. - Let's go.
let us go in and try to talk him down.
no, hold on.
what's going on?
I've got movement. Looks like Ramey and Wilhelm are inside the apartment.
attempting to apprehend.
what the hell happened in there?
Daws said it's a blitz attack. It's a different M. O.
Yeah, and this was done in broad daylight.
it's not our guy.
Yeah, Morgan, what have you got?
well, playboy's lieutenant was shot in the neck with a 0.357 magnum.
could have been our guy.
all right, I want you to stay on it.
Hotch, what's going on? - Nothing good.
Garcia, I need you to pull everything you can on a Phoenix gangbanger called diablo.
well, let's close it off here.
commander, can I speak to you for a second?
sorry to see it ends this way, losing another officer, but I'm glad it's over.
sir, I don't believe that it is.
what are you saying? The guy is dead.
this suspect diablo doesn't fit the profile.
are you telling me he didn't shoot officer Daws and his partner?
what I'm saying is, he may not be responsible for the earlier killings.
agent Hotchner! Agent Hotchner! - Commander, we have to be sure!
I have got the chief, I've got the press, I've the mayor.
do you realize the pressure the department's under right now?
Yes, sir, I do, but it wasn't him.
there was an earlier murder with the same M. O.
this unsub may have killed one of the twelves.
and how does that help us?
this unsub thinks of himself as a big game hunter now, but he didn't start out that way.
Meaning?
he started with a gang member, and he's evolved.
give me 24 hours.
they're not gonna wait that long, and neither is the chief.
I'll give you four.
Thanks, man. Great job.
Evans. I need your help.
I'd like you to pull a file on playboy's lieutenant.
it's over, agent. We got the guy.
no, we didn't.
what, because he turned out to be a gangbanger after all?
let it go. You guys made a mistake. You guys were wrong.
so was I. No harm, no foul.
no offense, lieutenant, but we're not wrong.
the killer is still out there, and more cops will die.
you heard what Officer Mercer said.
his partner was shot.
he couldn't do anything to save him.
do you want to feel like that when another one of your guys does get killed?
or do you want to know that you did everything you could to try to keep it from happening again?
ballistics aren't back yet,
but the preliminary M. E. reports suggest the weapon used to kill officer Beck was not a 0.357
I spoke to Garcia. Beck arrested diablo twice on drug charges, last time sent him away for 10 years.
diablo was just released on parole last week.
so diablo went after the cop who put him away assuming it would be lumped in with the other murders.
the unsub would take the fall.
Hey, it almost worked.
lieutenant, what did you find?
well, I pulled up that information on playboy's lieutenant, Bobby Q.
there's not much there.
and you're thinking playboy was right, that we didn't pay enough attention to the case.
did you?
look, the majority of homicides in this city are gang killings.
most times we spend time and resources following trails that all lead to the same place anyway.
we just assumed this was just another one of those trails.
being in a gang shortens your life expectancy,
so it's no big surprise when a gangbanger winds up dead.
same thing could be said about being a cop.
the job involves a fair amount of risk, so a percentage of untimely deaths is practically inevitable.
the M. O. is the same as our unsub's.
did, um, playboy tell you if the killer took a trophy?
he said Bobby Q's necklace was missing.
Yeah, that's in the report.
big chain, solid gold.
just figured the doer took it to pawn it.
or as a souvenir. - Fits the signature.
he built up to this. We need to go further back.
Garcia, can you pull everything in the Phoenix area
that matches the same M. O. as our unsub, not just police officers.
OK. So I'm searching homicides in phoenix in, what, the last 2 months?
make it three. - Got it.
murders, shootings, specifically neck wounds.
Oh, I got a guy named Robert Quinones, nickname Bobby Q.
we already have that one. Anything else?
Ah, just one more.
a bouncer at a bar in downtown Phoenix, Mickey Reese.
weapon's a 0.357 magnum. Interesting.
it says here the victim was wearing a ballistic vest.
apparently they don't serve Shley Temples at this establishment.
if the bouncer was wearing a vest, that could be how our unsub developed his M. O.
send us everything you've got. - Sure. Done.
all right, we got gangbangers, bouncers and cops.
all pretty tough targets; victims capable of defending themselves.
as the unsub's sense of power escalated, so did his confidence,
leading to bigger and more difficult prey.
that makes sense. Risky deaths would increase the unsub's feeling of superiority.
same thing with using a 0.357 magnum. It would make him feel powerful.
cops are at the top of that list.
high profile, always on alert, and they're gonna make headlines.
killing a gangbanger isn't easy.
they're always armed, travel in packs.
the bouncer's the earliest.
it was a pretty simple attack, no carefully thought out plan.
he could have been his first victim.
we need to figure out where their paths crossed.
Morgan, you, Rossi and the lieutenant go check out the bar.
we'll keep digging.
like I told the cop before, it could have been anyone.
did Reese have any enemies?
that's all he had. Mick was a real hard ass. Always looking to get into it.
pissed off someone pretty much every night.
looks like he took quite a beating before he was killed.
any idea which one of your patrons might have given him these bruises?
didn't get those here, man.
he was into some kind of crazy club.
extreme fighting, or some crap like that.
looked like that, and worse, all the time.
worked pretty good for his job, know what I mean?
a fight club would be the perfect place for the unsub to try to prove himself.
and a beating might be the stressor we're looking for.
do you know where this club is?
go, go!
FBI, get on the ground!
get on the ground right now! Get on the ground! Get on the ground!
don't move! Get down!
that way, let's go.
ain't breaking no laws here, officer.
agents, no matter what it looks like...
I think he's trying to let us know they have the right to be idiots.
they do, but not here. Listen up, folks.
this warehouse is not private property.
it is owned by the city, which means...
you all are going to jail.
pa 'em up, let's go.
we ain't hurting nobody, except maybe each other.
Yeah, I feel you, but we're still taking you in.
unless you want to answer some questions and make all this go away.
so ask me.
you know this man? - Yeah. Boom.
I heard. But I didn't kill him.
no, but someone who came here did.
no way. Boom could take all of us.
we aren't looking for a tough guy.
the man we're looking for probably lost every fight.
he came in here trying to be a man.
but he failed.
guy went down easily.
candy ass.
maybe even in his first fight.
he probably reacted poorly to that.
to the point where you and your boys, you ridiculed him.
all this led him to pick up a gun.
there was a guy. Called himself "animal."
lost every fight, but he kept coming back, getting in Boom's face, calling him out.
most guys lose big, they run home, tail between their legs.
this one freaked.
there's something about that hand at your throat, when you're beat.
knowing your opponent's got your whole life in his hand.
Ah, it's primal, man.
when he lingers...
that's what he's doing to his victims.
proving his power over life and death.
what's animal's real name?
there's no names here. Just nicknames. Like me. I'm beanie.
well, what do you know about this animal? Anything at all?
nothing. That's the way it works, you know?
don't talk about it.
how about a description?
scrawny, white trash.
thought he's a whole lot tougher than he is.
get him set up with a sketch artist.
beanie... Let's go.
so what do we do now?
we don't have a lot of choices.
based on his escalating timeline, this guy's about to strike again soon.
there's really only one thing we can do.
earlier today, the Phoenix police announced the suspect responsible for the deaths of 5 Phoenix officers had been caught.
that is not the case.
the killer is still at large.
there have been quite a few mistakes made over the course of this investigation,
mistakes that could have been avoided.
as a result of this, the FBI is officially taking charge of the investigation.
we have established a tip line, and a sketch of the subject is being released to the press.
we encourage anyone with any information about the shooter to contact us immediately.
the man we're looking for is a narcissist and a psychopath desperate to prove his masculinity.
he does this by going after high risk targets like gang members and police officers.
because he is a narcissist, this unsub will be following the investigation closely.
by pretending to take over the investigation, we've put ourselves above the local police,
thus suggesting that we're tougher to take out,
and issuing the unsub a challenge that he won't be able to ignore.
and painting a target directly on Agent Hotchner's back.
all the attacks, with the exception of the last one,
have taken place in the twelve's territory.
this is the unsub's hunting ground, and he's unlikely to stray from it.
where did you say you saw the suspect?
police department, how can I help you?
Phoenix police hotline.
locations have multiple vanish points for the shooter,
but limited access and exit routes for his victims.
we'll be looking for a similar situation.
this should happen very quickly.
don't forget-- this guy managed to take out 5 cops by himself.
he smart, and he's fearless.
he won't be easy to take down.
FBI tip line.
I saw that guy. Your killer. The one from tv.
male caller. He says he knows where the unsub lives, and it fits the criteria.
2717 Gelson Avenue.
it's the twelve's territory, just off the main street.
looks like there's a series of smaller feeders and allies nearby.
this could be it. - Let's go.
slow down, lieutenant. He'll be expecting us. All of us.
this is his last stand. He's going to want to make it count.
Yeah, well, this time we know about it and we're ready.
his trap could still work.
15th Avenue and Gelson. What do you know about the neighborhood?
it's rough. Lots of dead-end streets, allies.
major cross street, 17th.
residential? Any businesses at all?
there's a gas station a couple of blocks down, but that's about it.
Hey, Garcia? - Yes?
can you get us a satellite image of 15th Avenue and Gelson?
but of course. Ok, real time satellite image shows...
not a whole heck of a lot.
I've got a 2-story apartment building, no activity of any kind, no cars out in front.
Oh, there's a car down the street.
no heat registering, engine must be cool.
satellite monitoring the last 12 hours is like library-quiet.
a truck and 2 cars left in the a. m. nothing came in.
thank you, Garcia.
all right, there's a major street in front on the east side, an ally,
and 2 smaller streets to the north and south right here.
lieutenant, commander, I need a sniper here and here.
once they're set, the bulk of the squad cars can approach from the south,
and the rest of us from the east very quietly.
from this point forward, everybody goes in on foot.
Morgan, you and I go in first. Rossi and Prentiss behind us.
jordan, you and Reid stay here and work the tip line.
stay safe, my loves. - Thanks, Garcia.
clear! Clear!
false alarm. We knew we'd get some.
what now? - We wait.
you might want to split your officers into shifts. It could be a long night.
not this time. You're done.
let's go.
you knew he wouldn't be at the first address.
we figured he'd wait until Hotch was alone.
so the tip was a diversion.
something like that.
thank you. And your team.
no thanks necessary, lieutenant.
we did it together.
no, playboy!
Hotch... Why don't you go on ahead?
I think I'm going to stick around. There's something I want to do.
agent Morgan. - Derek.
this way.
this is Agent Morgan from the FBI.
Maggie Cunningham and Sam, my partner's family.
Mrs. Cunningham, I'm sorry for your loss.
thank you.
Hey, Sam... We got the bad guy who did this.
Sam, your father was a hero.
don't you ever forget that.
for he today who sheds his blood with me shall be my brother.
william Shakespeare.
sarasota, FLORIDA - State street. - Not again.
cop was just doin' his job.
he didn't really have to direct traffic around me.
he saved dozens of lives that day, honey.
all right. Now, seat belt and...
Oh, no talking on the phone.
you need to be totally confident in the seat so you can be aware of, uh...
what's happening around you.
I have to go.
no, no, no. Come on. It's sunday. You promised.
want your mom to take you?
come on, Andrea.
I'll be home before dinner.
Yeah, right. You said that last time.
I was gonna tell you this later, but, uh, I really need to see you smile,
so when you've gotten your license, this little beauty is all yours.
dad!
how do you like your old man now, huh?
but you can't let your grades slip. - No, they won't. They won't.
uh, hello, Lisa.
Lisa, guess who just got a new car.
no way.
and all I have to do is get my license.
and... - And keep my grades up.
uh, Mr. Harris, can you talk to my dad?
so great. - I love it. That's awesome.
did you guys hear there's another girl missing?
what, do you know her?
she goes to Bennett.
high school? Well, all the other girls were in college.
maybe it's not the same guy.
but he alternates between black and white girls.
what, you guys don't read the paper?
if he's going younger, we're in trouble.
what is this about?
yes?
william Harris, you're under arrest for the kidnapping of Missy Dewald and the murder of 3 women.
you have the right to remain silent. - You have a warrant?
look in the attic, the garage, and the storage shed.
she's here somewhere.
anything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law.
you have the right to have an attorney present during the questioning.
if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.
do you understand these rights? - Yes.
William, what is going on? - It's a mistake. It's a mistake.
I'll be home soon.
what are you doing?
got tired of waiting.
what's that supposed to mean?
you can look all you want. Missy Dewald isn't here.
all week, you been sayin' he need privacy and time.
you told me he wouldn't keep her on his property, but I wouldn't listen.
detective, we have a witness who can place him at the abduction site.
he has a history of similar offenses where he did use the same M. O.in Atlanta.
he fits the profile-- a high-functioning successful family man living and working in the area.
you had probable cause to make the arrest.
we just don't have enough to prosecute him yet.
what's our next move?
the key to finding her could be in his house,
so we're gonna need to dig through all there is of his life
family, work, his friends.
agent Morgan and I will interrogate him.
all right.
he holds his victims for 2 days before he kills them.
Missy disappeared yesterday.
so as long as he stays in custody, there's a good chance she could still be alive.
talk to the detective that arrested him for the Atlanta rapes.
find out what went right and what went wrong with their approach.
williams is a successful litigator, so we're gonna need some leverage,
somethin' to throw him off guard.
a discrepancy in a previous statement, that's enough to give us the upper hand.
I'll get on that.
now, we can only hold him for so long after he goes before the judge.
what are the odds we can get him to break in the next 12 hours?
that's not gonna be easy.
if his lips are silent, he chatters with his fingertips.
betrayal oozes out of him at every pore.
sigmund Freud.
did he do it? Did William Harris rape and kill those girls?
I'm sorry. I can't answer that.
he was the coach of my daughter's soccer team.
please. I'm afraid to let her leave the house.
I know this is frustrating.
as soon as we get any information, we will release it to the public.
hold tight, ok?
excuse me.
william Harris, I'm special agent Derek Morgan.
this is special agent David Rossi.
before you, uh, answer any questions,
I need to remind you that you're entitled to have a lawyer present.
I am a lawyer.
she look familiar to you?
how 'bout her?
her? No?
the three of these girls were raped, strangled, and dumped.
my god. I have a daughter their age.
Missy Dewald. She went missing yesterday.
what do you think you have on me?
we have a witness who can place you at the mall the same time of her abduction.
and, uh, well, rumor has it that you seem to have a history of this type of behavior.
how is that?
tell us about Atlanta.
Atlanta? Those charges were dropped. It was a mistake.
because the 2 rape victims wouldn't testify, and now you cover your tracks by killing them.
I didn't do this.
so, William, you've been married, what, 18 years?
you remember that feeling you get when you fall in love?
all those firsts-- the kiss, the smell of her hair-- it's exciting.
you miss that feeling, don't you?
being married to the same woman, it's like ordering the same entree for 18 years.
agent Rossi, every minute you spend with me is another minute she's alone with him.
so we've brought in the wrong guy?
Yes.
just like they did in Atlanta.
Yes.
and by the time you realize I've been telling the truth...
this poor girl could be dead.
would you prefer to do this alone?
uh, this may be too disturbing for your daughter.
it's ok. We have no secrets.
can you account for William's whereabouts for the last 24 hours?
my dad was at home with us.
the whole time?
he may have ran out for about an hour or so. I really don't rember.
3 girls have been murdered, Mrs. Harris.
Missy Dewald is missing now, and she's running out of time.
that's not my fault.
how would you feel if someone was hurting Andrea?
why did you move to florida 6 months ago?
my dad got a better offer with another firm.
it had nothing to do with the rape charges in Atlanta?
those charges were dropped.
do you really think it's a coincidence your husband's been a suspect twice?
it was a mistake, just like this.
has William been distant lately?
spent a lot of time behind closed doors?
he works a lot. Is that a crime?
I think you've known something is off, and it's made you wonder.
it's something only you would know.
Mrs. Harris, you can save Missy Dewald's life, in spite of what's happening in your family.
that's enough. This interview is over.
you find anything?
give me a minute. I will find the grime.
all right. You ready to start searching his computer?
born ready.
seem to be in control.
I'm always in control, sweet cheeks.
so far, William Harris appears to be quite intelligent.
he's covering his tracks pretty well.
Yeah, just because you delete your history,
it doesn't mean all your dirty cyberlaundry isn't hanging out there for me to find on your hard drive.
rookie mistake.
keep moving, sir. - Bailiff...
Mr. Harris can have a few moments with his family.
dad. - Honey.
how's my girl?
I'll be fine once you're home.
I'm workin' on that. How you doin'?
I know. Believe me, I know.
but, uh, they don't have a case.
honey, bail was set at $5 million. They must have something.
well, after Atlanta...
OK, so what should I do? Should I pull money from the retirement fund?
just use the house. - The house?
honey, where are we gonna go if something happens?
everything is gonna be fine. - Mr. Harris.
I have to go. Look after your mom for me. - I will.
I need you to be strong. I love you both.
we love you, too, honey. Thank you.
did you see how Sharon reacted when he said to put up the house?
she's starting to doubt him.
Garcia's been digging through William's computer.
she found an encrypted link to a web page.
Where'd it take you?
uh, an unsearchable, untraceable blog with tons of journal entries.
it's like some sort of diary.
you find anything incriminating?
I was able to differentiate between 2 distinct voices, 2 authors.
I found various idiosyncratic words, phrases, punctuation,
and orthography within the blog entries consistent with each separate person
words like "soda" and "pop."
one guy uses dashes while the other uses ellipses.
Where'd you find this kid?
he was left in a basket on the steps of the F. B.I.
one side of the discourse made a reference to the devil's strip.
what the hell's that?
uh, it's a small patch of grass that separates the sidewalk from the street.
now, that term is only used in central ohio.
william lived in Atlanta for 20 years, but he grew up in columbus.
the other guy uses words like "turnpike" and "filling the gas tank,"
both specific regionalisms for Florida.
kid, you sure about this? Right.
was there a new development?
I can't rember the last time I smiled for so long that it hurt.
I've never felt like this before.
sounds like you're bored at home.
havin' an affair?
I told you I'm happily married.
does your wife know about your secret diary?
I bet she'd like to know how good you are at keeping secrets.
I'm not sure what you think you've found,
but you've gone from completely wrong to completely insane.
you're hiding something, William.
no jury will convict me because somebody saw me at the mall
and you think I'm talking with someone other than my wife.
we found Missy.
told you so.
you son of a bitch!
detective, no! - Damn you!
that's her. That's Missy.
I looked her father in the eye and swore I'd find her alive.
so since we've been here, this girl's gone missing and now turned up dead.
do you think he dumped the body before he was picked up?
the m. e.estimates she was killed several hours ago.
but we've had William Harris in custody.
you think we have the wrong guy?
I don't think so.
he's communicating with someone.
he's confident they won't turn against him.
I don't think he's having an affair.
he has a partner.
and that partner's doing everything he can to get Harris out of jail.
I love the challenges..." "the only suspense for tonight...
was tough, but I figured it out..." "perfect timing...
I watch them chase their little spawns...
...passage truly. Those first few hours are the best.
faith should never be broken.
tell me you found his partner.
it's all so cryptic.
the end of the day came too soon.
well, they clearly enjoyed being together.
they wrote a cluster of others right after the first victim, Kim Groves, Was killed.
we need to figure out how they met.
there's gotta be something in all this about their courtship.
it all seemed so hopeless, but I finally learned to rise above it.
it sounds like William confessed he was feeling incomplete.
he was.
he didn't start killing until he met his soul mate.
faith should never be broken.
the longer they got away with it, the stronger their relationship.
sounds like these two aren't just obsessed with rape and murder.
they're addicted to one another.
we could have saved her.
there were no signs of his having a partner until now.
I guess that's why he's so cocky.
well, his arrogance is typical of a dominant personality.
he's found a submissive who's willing to kill for him.
the partner is a biter.
we found marks on Missy Dewald.
they never did that before.
well, with William out of the picture, he's changed his behavior.
maybe the partner went back to something that's comfortable, something he's done before.
I've got Garcia checking dental records against other cases.
D. A.was ready to charge him when Missy was still alive.
how the hell are we supposed to keep him now?
I'm surprised you're writing all this stuff to a fella.
sounds like you have a real special thing goin' on.
I mean, I'm thinkin' if the two of you had just got it on,
maybe these women would still be alive.
so where'd you meet him?
chat room? Porn sites? Gay bar?
whoever this guy is, he's lookin' out for you, cleaned up for you.
Missy Dewald is dead.
has he called yet?
lee Jarvis, the D. A.
I saw his name on the warrant.
he's got the best conviction rate in florida.
do you know why?
I wanna know why your pen pal killed her when he could have let her rot.
Jarvis doesn't like to lose.
he's not gonna ruin his record over this.
wow, this friend of yours wants to please you bad, doesn't he?
Oh, he is protecting you, doin' whatever he's gotta do to make sure that you're innocent.
he killed Missy so you could be together again.
it's only been a few hours, but he misses you.
and you've gotten what exactly from all this?
proof that someone out there is just as sick as you.
it turns out there's a lot of sick pups in central Florida.
today's dental records do not match William Harris,
but do match a reported rape in manatee county earlier this year.
that's great. You got a match.
Yeah, the teeth belong to the same person,
but they've never been arrested, so I can't cross-reference.
what about the victim?
Connie mayers. She still lives in the area.
they're gonna ask who you are. They don't know.
we're just buying flowers. - Those daisies are nice.
in your report, uh, it says your attacker knew what he wanted, that he was confident.
more like a control freak.
he wore a mask, but I could tell he was white.
he choked me.
took a long time for the bruises to go away.
I swear when the light's right, I can still see his hand right here.
I'm sorry.
it's not as bad as the bite marks.
I mean, they're scars now.
I haven't been with anyone since, so I haven't had to explain.
let me wrap these for you. - Thank you.
Connie mayers described an anger-excitation rapist just like William.
so we're lookin' at 2 dominant personalities.
makes sense. They have a similar discourse. They're equally well-written.
that's a big deal. - It's rare in criminal partnerships.
if their personalities are the same, their lives probably mirror one another's as well.
Harris goes to church, on the board of the p. t.a.
coaches his daughter's soccer team, rarely drinks.
sounds like a saint.
with a dark side. That's what he connected to in the partner.
Prentiss and I will go talk to the family, see if they know who it might be.
2 alpha males won't be easy to break.
the partner is definitely following the investigation.
let's do the talking for them.
you want me to put this out in the public?
we've got something better.
why would he read it? He knows William won't be writing.
these men are addicted to each other.
right now, he needs a fix, and the words they've shared are all he has to cling to.
his partner wrote "faith should never be broken.
a betrayal could devastate him.
all we have to say is that William's cooperating...
and then hope he takes the bait.
have you noticed William pay extra attention to anyone?
no.
or has he gone out of his way to avoid anyone?
we've been here for 6 months, still got boxes to unpack.
suggesting that William's found time to bond with someone?
you know, we think we know the ones we love, but everybody can keep secrets.
the man we're looking for is, uh, just like your dad.
he's smart, strong, confident.
he may have a family also.
Oh, so now you're gonna accuse someone else's dad of murder.
that's really great.
it is the last thing we wanna do.
we believe the accomplice has done this before.
that victim described a white man in his forties.
this may be someone you would recognize.
and there's a good chance he's gonna check up on you.
and why would he do that?
he's worried about your dad, but he has no way of communicating with him.
you and your mom are the next best thing.
he's uncertain right now, and that may manifest itself in mood swings.
we made a deal after Atlanta.
there wouldn't be a chance for any more misunderstandings.
and how's that working out for you?
so do you like where you live?
I do. Yeah. D. C.'s nice.
so is this place.
now it's just like Atlanta.
everyone thinks my dad's guilty, and it'll just get worse.
I'm sorry about that.
what have we got so far?
uh,"we were surprised that you injected yourself "into the investigation.
you risked a lot in order to help William.
and killin' Missy tells us how close you really are.
it must be devastating to learn that William is here with us.
he's not gonna like that. Sounds like William's cooperating.
well, that's exactly what we want him to believe, so he'll doubt their alliance.
william is here with us.
most entries followed the first murder.
Yeah, William wrote most of them.
uh,"I wasn't expecting that type of gift.
I wish time didn't take away all the pleasures of the day.
gotta see this.
what's that smirk?
Sharon is posting bail.
I'm thinkin' about where to go for dinner.
you know, maybe we got it wrong.
maybe they'r not both alpha males.
maybe we'll go to Salvatores.
partner made the first move. He's the one with the balls.
Yeah, and it was pretty risky, too.
think about it. What if you did turn in here?
or at least your partner thought you turned in here, hmm?
then he'd have no choice but to turn himself in. Your lives would be ruined.
that's the reason it works.
you both have everything to lose.
he's only cleaning up because he can't afford to get caught either. Am I right?
how is gonna react to the entry we wrote?
he knows we're reading your little love letters, so we decided to send one ourselves,
let him know you're in here helping us out.
he's probably feeling pretty betrayed right about now.
and if he is, what do you think he's doin' about it?
William, you wrote, "thanks for the perfect place to play.
what were you talkin' about?
golfing. - Golfing?
golfing. Right.
what was it like?
perfect.
I've never let 'em see my face before.
me either. - You think she's gonna talk?
they all think about it, but, uh, too scared.
I don't know. This one, this one seems defiant.
well, I don't think we should risk it.
Blood's... Not my thing.
it doesn't have to be messy.
you mean like this?
Yeah, like that.
you probably don't recognize 'em like this, do you, William?
happy and smilin'.
all these gifts. All these girls.
this is someone's child.
you know, Missy Dewald, she was supposed to meet her parents for dinner.
she was 18 years old, an only child, and you just took her away.
I feel sorry for those parents. I really do.
do you hear yourself?
not an ounce of sincerity.
you just proved you were incapable of empathy.
just like your partner.
William, you never would have done any of this without him.
but you just weren't complete, right?
wait. What is that? - Honey, stay here.
mom-- - stay here.
get OUT!
what the hell? Aw, damn kids.
don't you worry, Sharon.
we are gonna take care of this.
thank you.
it's been so long, my heart aches.
I need to see that face again soon.
I mean, it's pretty obvious there's an emotional connection between you two, huh?
can't deny that.
but, you know, William, doesn't really sound like 2 buddies to me.
sounds more like 2 men in love with each other.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
you're right.
I have absolutely no idea what it's like to be in love with another man.
you know, everyone who goes into law enforcement-- ahem--has this air of moral superiority.
you, it seeps out of every single pore.
black cop in the F. B.I.
you got a big chip on your shoulder, lot to prove.
now who's the one who has no idea what he's talkin' about?
we're not so different, you and I.
the games we play, we chose because they make us feel powerful.
so what do you have, special agent Morgan?
prove beyond a reasonable doubt that I have broken the law.
but don't you sit there with that smug look on your face and judge me, boy.
first of all, I am not your boy, and this look on my face is a look of contempt, because you disgust me.
you and I are nothin' alike.
when we do find this, uh, friend of yours,
there isn't a jury out there who won't find you guilty.
how's it goin' in there?
we're just tradin' punches.
he's watchin' the clock, waitin' for his bail to be posted.
I can't thank you enough. - You don't need to thank me.
I just wish I could have done a better job for you.
what's goin' on?
Steven, uh, cleaned up the mess outside.
Why? - Andrea, don't be rude.
it's ok, Sharon.
I--I like to help out a friend whenever I can.
I didn't even know you and my dad were friends.
look, I know how hard this must be for you.
just know your dad is gonna be home soon.
people are gonna forget this ever happened.
everything's gonna go back the way it was before, ok? You guys have a good day.
thank you.
somehow I doubt that.
what was that about?
well, why is he bein' so nice all of a sudden?
this is exactly what those F. B.I. People said to look out for.
I will not have you alienate the only person who's been kind to us since your father was arrested.
you understand me?
you got something?
one day, the partner wrote,"I feel like such an outsider.
no one understands me.
I watch them chase their little spawns, the same old conversations.
nothing stimulates me.
sounds like a party with kids.
Yeah, and somebody was not happy to be there.
I looked over, and everything changed. The only spark in my day.
this is it. It's buried in a later entry, but he's talking about the first time they met.
I looked across the room, and everything changed.
the only spark in my day.
it feels so good, so free, so right.
you moved here 6 months ago.
you met him some time after that, didn't you?
Thanks, man. Here you go, buddy.
thank you. - Welcome.
will Harris. - Steve baleman.
saw you movin' in last week. - Ah, yeah.
you all unpacked? - Ah, for the most part.
but my wife Sharon, she's, uh-- she's amazing.
she takes care of the house. I take care of everything else.
that's a good woman.
let me tell you, took me a while, but I finally got annie trained.
Hey, sweetie.
you're a lucky man.
what do we have here? - Thank you.
Aw, you're too kind, ladies.
you know, most people around here would be pretty excited about this plain old burger here.
but, uh, it's really nothin' special.
well, a good piece of meat would be nice.
stick to your bones, huh?
bloody rare and tender.
well, uh, variety is the spice of life.
I couldn't agree more.
Cheers.
you think that's funny?
no, I just remembered something.
I really hope you enjoy these memories,
because they're all you're gonna have in prison.
you know what you are? You're lost.
I think you've been runnin' from yourself your entire life, tryin' to disappear.
did I say something that upset you?
What'd you think you were gonna do, man?
what, if you got away from Atlanta, all these little urges, they'd just go away?
so you go find another posh little uppity neighborhood,
and you think it might make you feel a little better about yourself?
make you feel whole, more complete?
didn't work too well, though, did it?
Nah, nothin' seems to make William happy, not even his beautiful wife and daughter.
but then you wake up one day, and there he is,
somebody just as sick and pathetic as you are, and your whole world changes.
is all this about that black comment?
you really think that we're the same because of our skin color?
that's all we have in common.
you hurt innocent people. I don't.
you're not even a man.
that a fact? - That is a fact.
if you had anything, I'd be in a cell by now.
you will be.
shouldn't be outside, Andrea. It's not safe.
Oh, wait. Your dad's in jail.
we have nothing to worry about.
what's your problem?
my problem? I'm not the one with the freaky family.
shut up.
is that why you moved from Atlanta?
your dad was rapin'
he didn't do it.
that's not what the newspaper said.
you know, you're about the same age as those girls.
I bet he started with you.
what's goin' on over there? - Nothin'.
everybody needs to go home right now.
loser.
you ok? - Yeah. They're just being jerks.
now, look, I saw your mom was gone.
if you need any company, I'm around, ok?
I'm fine. Really. Really.
Reid, we need to figure out where that party was.
let's review one more time.
I'm a serial killer writing my partner.
why do I keep a secret blog?
it's a safe way to relive your crimes.
uh, no one ever sees you together, and, uh, no one overhears you talking.
I'd buy all that.
sounds like they take turns surprising each other.
uh, listen to this. "I love the challenges.
the timing is always perfect. "thanks for tonight.
it was tough, but I figured it out. Nothing was gonna keep me away.
what are you thinking?
they never write about a time.
so how'd they know when to meet?
Steven, what are you doing?
don't walk away! We need to talk about this!
I told you, leave me alone!
what have we got?
all 4 victims were abducted at different times of day.
it was never consistent.
one was even taken on thanksgiving morning when she went to the market for her mom.
other than the blog, there is nothing else suspicious on Mr. Sneaky's phone or his computer.
all texts, numbers, and files have been accounted for.
what did they do to communicate?
we're missing something.
we know based on the language and the knowledge of the area that
the partner was most likely born and raised in florida.
all right, let's work with the theory that the partner lives in sarasota.
they don't call. They don't write.
the signal could be something visual, or it could be something audible.
OK, if it's visual, that could be hanging a flag on their house.
and if it's audible, they'd obviously have to live close enough to each other to hear it.
something audible. Something you can hear.
what if...
what if they're not writing poetry to each other?
what if they're writing lyrics to a song?
Uh,"this feels so good, so free, so right.
give me something else.
uh,"It looks so right. It's all I need tonight.
I found it.
Garcia, that's it. That was playing when we pulled in to the cul-de-sac.
it was coming out of a car.
that's the signal. That's how they knew to go back to Missy Dewald.
the partner lives nearby. That's where they met. It was a neighborhood party.
Garcia, we need to know which neighbor it is.
give me the parameters again.
we're looking for a while male. Married, with children.
he's either got a good steady job, or he owns his own business.
he's lived in florida his entire life.
within close proximity to William, there are 7 white males.
5 are married with children.
2 were born and raised in the sunshine state.
one is on disability.
one owns a real estate business.
Oh, my god. He lives right next door.
are you following me? Are you?
he was angry and just took off.
why was he upset? - He's been like this all day.
when did it start? - I don't know.
this morning.
so after William was arrested, he became hostile, didn't he, nervous?
steven is a good man.
he's not who you think he is.
did you see Andrea out here? - No.
why is annie crying?
we think that Steven is William's accomplice.
Where's Steven?
we're trying to figure that out. - Oh, my god.
andrea said it was strange that he was the only nice one.
he was checking in on us.
I wasn't listening. I'm sorry.
now they're both gone.
it's time you talked to William.
no, Steven baleman is not just your neighbor.
and you know this how?
you told us.
those don't prove anything.
and after all this time, you figuring out who my neighbor is feels like a really small victory.
where did Steven take Andrea?
wh-what are you talkin' about?
she suspected him, and now they're both missing.
how could you? She believed you.
th-they're missing?
all those times you disappeared, I knew it wasn't work.
I thought maybe, maybe you were having an affair,
and I couldn't confront you, because then that would make it real.
then I'd have to find the truth buried in your lies,
and you have been paid to lie for so long.
it is who you are!
look, all of this is almost too much. It's too much for anybody to put up with.
but it's almost over.
I didn't put up the house.
you--you didn't post bail?
I didn't wanna believe it in Atlanta, and I'm not gonna deny it again.
now, where did Steven take Andrea?
where is she? Where is...
you son of a-- you son of a bitch!
how'd that feel, William?
you see what you're doin'?
kim groves, your words-- "the first few hours are the best.
nobody's run out of steam yet.
Andrea's been gone for 2 hours.
what's he doing to her right now?
what is he doin', William? Touchin' her?
maybe he's bitin' her, huh?
this is what he does when you're not around.
your little boyfriend is twisted, and now he's got your baby girl.
you know better than us.
has she been in pain this whole time?
steven took your daughter.
the man you trusted with your life has betrayed you.
what, is nothin' sacred to you?
so Steven baleman has a couple of commercial properties, but so far, there's nothing.
only he knows where Steven took Andrea.
I can't believe he sold out his daughter to protect his partner.
he's protecting himself.
the minute he says anything, he's guilty.
what was it you said about Missy, hmm?
man, turn around and look at me!
for every minute that goes by, he's alone with her, right?
well, it's Andrea's turn now.
what is wrong with you, man?
why aren't you tryin' to run out that door and save your child?
you think he's not gonna hurt her? Why?
did you make some kind of deal? Family's off-limits?
the longer you are in here, the worse it looked for Steven.
he think you're in here betraying him, so now he's actin' out.
he's lost faith.
he is alone with your little girl.
she's probably cryin' out for you, sayin',"daddy, daddy, why aren't you helpin' me?
Why? Because you're standin' here, doin' nothin'.
you're the only person who can stop this.
be a man. For god sakes, be a father.
Oh, dad, thank god. - You're gonna be ok.
it's Steven. It's Steven.
I don't know where he went. I don't know.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
did he hurt you? - Did you think I'd hurt her?
that i'd betray you?
or is that because that's what you did to me?
I didn't tell them anything.
you didn't tell them anything? Dad, what are you talking about?
wait. How did you even know that I was here?
Andrea, honey, trust me.
daddy's gonna make it ok. Ok?
we had a deal.
faith should never be broken.
you took my daughter! - She followed me here!
she never would have said anything.
I never would have said anything?
honey, Andrea, please.
just--just trust me. Trust me, ok?
so how'd you get out?
uh, the case-- the case was dismissed.
Oh, really? Simple as that?
you killed Missy Dewald while I was in custody.
they didn't have enough to hold me.
he talked about Missy. We got him.
so he killed Missy Dewald, and what?
what? You killed all the others?
honey, please. - No.
don't--don't come close to me.
I had your back.
what were you gonna do? What if I hadn't shown up?
were you gonna kill her?
F. B.I! - Don't move! You're under arrest!
don't even think about it!
mom. Mom, get me out of here. Get me out of here.
OK. You're gonna be ok.
I wanna go away, ok? - Ok. I promise, baby.
the guy wanted just to see his partner again.
they needed to say good-bye.
those two had everything figured out except how it would end.
british historian C. Northcote Parkinson said, "delay is the deadliest form of denial.
we appeal to him, do not hurt any more people.
he killed those people because of something I said.
that is part of the job. Tell me now if you can do it or not.
he just killed his entire family.
is this my fault?
no way.
I'm not sure I can do this job.
Oh, it's up there, on the right.
come on, son, it's time.
I know you're awake.
what's wrong? - Nothing.
there's something on your mind. Tell us what it is.
what if she doesn't like me?
let her get to know you.
there's no rush.
is that really what you're worried about?
do I have to meet her this way?
we've been talking about this moment your whole life.
I know.
baby, look at me. You're almost 10.
you're becoming a man.
I love you.
I love you, too.
come on.
what was it? - Excuse me.
this isn't good.
we have a request from alabama.
have everybody meet in the conference room. I'll be there in 10 minutes.
a husband and wife were murdered at their home while they were sleeping.
their 10-year-old daughter went missing.
I gotta call you back.
when were the bodies discovered? - Less than an hour ago.
what was the time of death? - Approximately 1 A. M.
8 hours. - I know this isn't a serial.
you're right. Most abducted children don't survive past the first 24 hours.
Dave. - What's going on?
we got a missing 10-year-old girl, home invasion.
parents were killed in their sleep.
Where's our clock? - 8 hours and counting.
I'll find Morgan and Reid and tell them we're on the move.
good. Wheels-up in 30.
you need your go bag. Jordan?
right. Right.
please let me go. Let me go. I won't tell. Please.
it's ok.
we talked about this.
are you--are you thirsty?
please don't hurt me.
it's only water.
can I decide now?
it's up to you.
I'm gonna call you... Elena.
winston churchill said, "there is no doubt that it is around the family and the home
that all the greatest virtues of human society" are created, strengthened, and maintained.
we got the uplinks of the crime scene photos.
this is Geoff and Nancy Hale. Both their throats were cut.
any evidence of abuse? - Nothing.
slitting someone's throat is quick and efficient.
that's because the real target was down the hall.
she has a name. - What?
she's not "the target." Her name's Cate. She's 10 years old.
all right.
amber alert in effect?
since 7 A. M.this morning.
with the unsub's head start he could be anywhere within a 400-mile radius.
make sure that they're casting a widenough net. - Got it.
who discovered the bodies?
Jim Scheuren, Cate's biological father.
he was supposed to take her for the weekend.
the police don't consider him a suspect.
we'll want to talk to him anyway.
we're also going to need a list of registered sex offenders in a 20-mile radius.
what's the makeup of the Hales' neighborhood?
mostly white and middle class.
we'll need aerial views of the neighborhood.
if madison county doesn't have them, talk to Garcia.
Dave, you and Morgan go to the crime scene.
the rest of us will get up to speed at the precinct.
harvest, ALABAMA
I recognize you from the tv.
Derek Morgan. - Bo whitaker. Pleased to meet you.
point of entry's around back.
now, the neighbors didn't see or hear anything.
and the dogs lost the scent almost immediately.
not hard to target a family out here.
even in broad daylight.
walk 5 feet off the track, man could get lost for days.
so, he had plenty of privacy to watch what he was really after.
I prefer cities.
you can see them coming.
nothing very sophisticated.
knocked off the pane to unlock the door.
do you think the girl's dead?
depends on what he took her for.
the Hales' neighborhood is a series of rural roads and one-block streets.
how far to a main thoroughfare?
a little over 3 miles.
so he didn't come upon Cate by accident.
sheriff Bates. - Yes.
is Cate's father here yet?
he's on his way.
let me know the second he gets here.
I told you, we already checked out his alibi.
he's not good for this.
I know, but he might know who is. - All right.
is that the autopsy report?
listen, about the plane-- - oh, that's already forgotten.
find anything in Cate's room?
that's what's weird. There's no sign of struggle.
it didn't even look like she tried to get out of bed in a hurry.
her parents' throats were cut.
if there was the element of surprise, they might not have had time to scream.
both of them?
what are you looking for?
the neck wounds-- something's off.
I'm the unsub. I kill Geoff Hale first.
he presents the biggest threat.
but how do I do that without waking nancy who's sleeping right next to him?
no ligature marks. Neither one was tied down.
and no defensive wounds, either.
geoff Hale--cause of death was a single deep, smooth cut that severed the carotid artery.
and nancy?
Nancy Hale--death was caused by a series of jagged,
shallow wounds that punctured the carotid artery.
there's more than one unsub. - You're sure?
he was either able to restrain Nancy while he killed Geoff, or she woke up,
which means she would have screamed.
at which point, Cate would have woken up.
either way, we're looking at multiple unsubs.
so things are worse than we thought.
yes and no.
Cate's chances of survival just got better.
how do you figure?
two unsubs change the dynamics.
what do you mean, dynamics?
they spent more time with her.
Yeah, Prentiss has the same theory based on the autopsy report.
right. We're about to speak to Cate's father. Stay at the scene.
I'll call you the second I'm out. - Dad's in there.
sheriff, alert your men. We may be looking at a team.
I'll get it on the wire.
how's the father?
between you and me, I've cleaned up bar fights smell better than he does right now.
Mr. Scheuren. I'm aaron hohner. I'm with the fbi.
can I get you anything? Coffee?
no, no. I can answer your questions.
do you know if your ex-wife and her husband have any enemies?
no. I mean, I don't know.
I don't--I don't know. I
what about Cate? Has she talked about anyone new in her life?
she's a normal kid, you know? She... Meets people all the time.
this would be an adult, possibly a white male.
he might be an authority figure to her.
the reason that I ask is that given the location of your ex-wife's house,
we think someone has targed Cate specifically.
sorry.
well, is there anything that you can think of that might be helpful?
we like to go to the movies.
there's a new, uh, multiplex at the mall.
how often to you see Cate?
I have visitation every 2 weeks.
do you keep to that schedule?
the reason that I ask is that right now time is of the essence.
what's that supposed to mean?
with all due respect, sir, it means that if you can't add to my knowledge of Cate,
my time is better spent somewhere else.
I'll keep you posted with any developments.
agent-- - Yes?
there's one thing-- - hold on a second. I'm right here.
Hotch, I got it.
OK, bring it with you when you come to the station. Thanks.
what's going on?
Cate Hale has epilepsy, and whoever abducted her didn't know to take the medicine.
and the primary cause of seizures is stress.
remember what I said. - I know, dad.
just concentrate. He shouldn't even realize you're there.
I know.
go ahead.
chin up. This isn't something you learn overnight.
I'm ready now.
you need to master it here first.
now try it again.
no, no! Don't touch her. - What's wrong with her?
can you hear me? - Don't go near her.
she's sick. - She's no good.
we have to do something.
you're right.
we don't kill young girls.
this is my family.
then you kill her.
help! Help! Somebody!
her father's with her.
she's been in and out of consciousness, but her vitals are stable.
any sign of sexual assault?
we haven't tested yet. We want to give her time to process.
may we speak with her?
you should know, seizures often come with retrograde amnesia.
she might have holes in her memory.
Prentiss, you should do this alone. - Ok.
Thanks, sheriff.
Mr. Scheuren, hello.
I'm agent Emily Prentiss from the fbi.
I would like permission to speak with your daughter.
OK.
I'm sorry, I'd like to do it alone if possible.
Why?
I need to ask her certain questions, and sometimes it's easier for a girl to answer those questions - When there are no men present. - I'm her father.
daddy. Please?
all right, baby.
I'll be right outside. - Thank you.
Hey, Cate. My name's Emily.
I'm so sorry about your mom and your stepdad.
I'd like to ask you some questions so we can find out who di is that ok?
Yeah, it's ok.
the doctor told me that if the paramedics hadn't been alerted to her epilepsy, she might not have made it.
you helped save her life.
you seen this kind of thing before?
unfortunately.
and kids come out of it ok, huh?
it'll take time. And patience. She's going to need you.
yesterday would have been the first time I'd seen her in a month and a half.
a colleague of mine asked me the other day how my son was enjoying the christmas present he got for him,
and I had to make up an answer because I didn't know.
I think I'll get that cup of coffee now.
the police sent the blanket and Cate's clothing to be processed.
good.
Oh, captain, my captain.
I need a list of crimes involving partners within a 90-mile radius of harvest in the last 2 years.
all crimes? - Anything.
violent crimes, break-ins, whatever's in the system.
I need to be able to show Cate some mugshots.
you got it. One scumbag yearbook coming up.
so you think they're local?
they dumped Cate 84 miles from her home.
the sheriff who found her didn't think that she'd been there long.
with the unsubs' head start, they should have been long gone.
so we're zeroing in on them.
possibly. - Then what's wrong?
I don't know why they left her alive.
I'm going to do what's called a cognitive interview.
it's as much about the things you sensed as the things you saw.
I'm scared.
I know. That's ok.
I'm right here with you. I'm here all the way.
now, I need you to close your eyes.
OK.
what is the first thing you remember?
it's cold.
you're outside? Who's there?
a man. He told me to-- - keep quiet.
what is he doing? - He's holding my hand. It hurts.
he's waiting for something.
what does he look like?
I don't want to be here.
he can't hurt you, I promise. I'm right here.
tall. Dark hair. Old.
old? Old like me? - Old like my dad.
is anyone else there?
someone's coming! Emily! Emily! Emily, help me!
open the trunk! - Please help me!
OK, it's ok. I'm right here.
I promise you he cannot hurt you.
it's ok. It's ok.
so he put you in the trunk of the car?
open the trunk! - No!
how long were you in there? - I don't know. Not long.
10 minutes.
was the ride bumpy or smooth?
it was smooth.
I wanted to scream, but no sound would come out.
it's ok.
so the car stops, and they open the trunk. What do you hear?
wind. Wind through the trees.
and what do you smell?
cooking.
are you inside now?
they've taken my shoes off.
that's so you won't run.
I want you to look down at your feet and tell me what you're standing on.
carpet.
I'm in a little room.
with clothes and tinfoil all around me.
what else?
I--I hear bells.
what kind of bells?
small. Like a fairy.
every time they ring, the man says something to the boy.
the boy?
he's standing right next to you.
how old is he?
I'm 9. Almost 10.
puyule, come here.
his parents want me to play with him.
his parents?
Emily, I don't want to go. I don't want to go. No!
don't make me go! Emily, no! Emily! Emily!
it's ok, I'm right here. It's ok. It's ok.
Cate, open your eyes.
you did a really good job. Ok.
Mr. Scheuren, you have an incredibly strong little girl.
did he touch her?
no, no. Not in that way, no.
thank god.
she was taken by a family.
a family?
parents and a little boy about her age.
they took her from her house in a car and then into an rv.
a short ride on a road and then into a wooded area.
she say anything else?
she said the mother called the boy puyule, which I think is a romanian term of endearment.
I know I used to hear it when my mom was posted overseas.
get Rossi and Morgan on the closest rv parks. - Ok.
what are we looking at here? - I have no idea.
most people pay in cash.
we don't have much in the way of records.
ma'am, this was a family-- mother, father, small boy.
they would have kept to themselves and then left abruptly.
you just described most of my business.
the son wouldn't have mingled with other children.
he would have been tightly guarded by his parents.
sorry. I wish I could help.
the family we're talking about is eastern european.
they may have spoken some foreign words to each other.
they in some kind of trouble?
you remember them.
well, you can imagine I don't get a lot of people speaking foreign around here.
what can you tell us about them?
not much. The husband was real binesslike.
wife was nice, pretty. Son was quiet.
you didn't take down a license or a credit card?
left in the middle of the night and never came back.
and I wouldn't have thought twice about it if I didn't have to clean up the campsite from all the glass.
glass?
all over the ground.
almost like they did it on purpose.
can you show us where they parked?
I told you, you're not gonna find nothin'.
I cleaned it up.
well, thank you.
jordan was right, you know, on the plane.
what are you talking about?
well, we hide behind language.
we don't talk about the ugliness we see.
Rossi, we talk about it every day.
no. We talk facts. Signature, m. o. pathology.
what are you getting at?
we're working a case where a family is grooming their son to kill.
they're not just murdering people.
they're stealing children, poisoning minds.
Where's the horror?
we can't do this job if we let it get to us.
exactly.
is it a match?
which means the rv park owner was right.
they spread it on purpose.
so everything they do is part of some ritual.
have you ever seen anything like this before?
a family that ritualizes killing together? Definitely not.
you know, if the family speaks romanian, the spreading of the glass makes sense.
it's an eastern european superstition for good luck.
so they're romanian. We already knew that.
not just romanian.
we're talking about people that are highly superstitious and obsessed with ritual.
Romany. - Romany?
gypsies.
more accurately, someone who has perverted romany culture.
call Garcia.
they're tight-knit and nomadic like our unsubs, but not usually prone to violence.
Hiya, baby.
Hey, baby girl, we need to talk.
PG or nc-17?
you're on speakerphone.
I charge extra for groups.
we need you to run through crimes similar to the Hale murders in the last 2 years.
Oh, I already did that. Zip.
go back even further, Garcia.
cross-reference against any small towns that have had reports of petty theft associated with waves of romany populations entering the area.
Romany? - Gypsies.
as in "gypsies, tramps, and thieves"?
exactly.
Oh, bless you all for turning my life into a cher song.
you'll have it nearly immediately.
you're the best.
you need to get your men together right now.
why is that?
cause whatever ritual these people are trying to play out,
we know Cate Hale didn't fit their needs.
which means they'll have to try again.
it's too soon.
he turns 10 in a week.
it's not safe.
you see one you like?
she's a fine choice.
the unsubs we're looking for are a family.
a father, a mother, and a son, approximately 10 years old.
we believe they're of romanian descent.
the family travels in an rv, but they also have another vehicle
that they use to go back and forth between campsites and cities.
we need you to call every rv park in the area.
alert the owners to be on the lookout for a family that fits this description,
as well as a campsite that might have broken glass scattered around.
the breaking of the glass and the discarding of Cate Hale
because of her epilepsy leads us to believe that these are highly superstitious people
and that they are playing out a very specific ritual.
the focus of this ritual is the young girls.
do we know why? - No.
but we do know from the location of Cate Hale's house
that they don't come across these girls by accident.
they study. They hunt.
Cate's father said that she liked to go to the movies at their local multiplex.
that's a good place to start.
also look at the parks, malls.
concentrate on those that are an easy drive from the rv parks you loCate.
this family is out there and they're looking for their next victim.
you guys need to see this right now.
excuse us.
what'soing on?
Garcia, you still there? - Present.
explain what you got.
OK, I went ahead and went further back looking for similar cases and I made the search national.
all these are hits? - Yeah.
there's 30 of them. They go as far back as 1909.
rapid city, south dakota, taos, new mexico, gary, indiana.
my map is lit up like a christmas tree.
all these girls were abducted and had their parents killed?
the time between the kills was long enough and the regions of the country so spread out
that it never showed up as serial.
what the hell is this?
I don't know, but it looks like it's been going on for generations.
Madison, ALABAMA
Reid and I will check inside.
we've doubled our highway patrol shifts and we've got roadblocks at every county line.
is there a picture on the wire?
I pulled one out of her bedroom myself.
they're bound to have hours on us.
they didn't travel that far last time.
the past killings have been years apart.
we got lucky with Cate Hale.
her epilepsy saved her life.
if this new girl fits the unsub's need, we might have lost our window to catch them for years.
this is what I don't get.
in both this house and the Hales' house the girls' bedrooms were closest to the exit.
I mean, the unsubs actually had to go out of their way to kill the parents before abducting the girls.
I think it was a countermeasure.
what do you mean?
they've been doing this for years and they've never been caught.
Why?
they disappear in the dead of night, they have a head start on the cops,
and they don't kill again for years.
exactly.
when I was a cop, I would get 10 calls a day from parents in child abductions.
now, as sad as that is, if the families didn't stay on you, at a certain point,
other cases would just start taking priority.
so what are they doing with these girls?
Yeah, what do you got, baby girl?
are you sitting down?
you're not gonna believe this. - What's wrong?
I think I know what they were doing with the girls.
Garcia got a hit on a hair fiber in the blanket the unsubs used to wrap Cate Hale.
so what's the problem?
it belonged to Kathy gray.
why does that name sound familiar?
she went missing in 1971 after her parents were murdered.
so you're telling me this little girl is now one of our unsubs?
that's what it looks like.
call Hotch. Tell him and Prentiss not to come here and to meet us at the station.
you ok?
Yeah. I just need to build a tcker skin.
you don't need to do anything you don't want to. You understand?
so these little girls got abducted and later kidnapped other girls and killed their families?
I think that's why these unsubs pick girls the same age as the boy.
what do you mean?
they're making wives.
it's ok.
I know what you're going through.
I understand. I really do.
come here. I'm going to take this off you now. Ok?
come here.
I want my mommy.
no, no, no, everything's ok.
you're a part of something now.
I was just like you.
a working theory from 1971 was that a transient killed the family and abducted Kathy gray.
then all the leads went cold.
how do you watch your family get murdered and then make a life with the people who did it?
it's stockholm syndrome. You adapt or die.
and now she's training her son to be a murderer.
at a certain point, once traditions are handed down generation after generation,
there is no right or wrong.
you simply accept the way the world works.
the romany are a closed society.
the unsub simply twisted and distorted traditions to become entirely insular.
abduction the children keeps the bloodline pure,
and killing the parents ensures that people eventually stop loong for them.
we got a report of an rv on fire about 20 miles from here.
Dave, you, Reid, and Morgan go check it out.
Garcia, I need you to digitally alter Kathy Gray's photograph to simulate what she would look like today.
consider it simulated. - Thanks.
it was started less than an hour ago, so they can't be far.
it looks like they left almost everything.
the got the girl they wanted. They're starting over.
look at the clothes.
most of them still have the store sensors on them.
so how'd they get them past security scanners?
tinfoil. - Excuse me?
Cate Hale remembers being locked in a closet surrounded by clothing and tinfoil.
shoplifters use tinfoil to line their bags and negate security alarms.
makes sense. A lot of romany make their living as petty thieves.
it also explains the bells she heard.
Cate says she remembers hearing the sound of bells,
followed directly by the father talking to the son.
I think that's probably what the mannequin's for.
school of the 7 bells.
you dress a mannequin, you line a suit with 7 bells.
if you can pick his pocket without a bell ringing, you're ready to work a crowd.
so we know how they make their money.
that's not all we know.
these unsubs are guided entirely by ritual.
they abducted Lynn Robillard and killed her family in an area
that they knew was surrounded by police and the fbi.
they had to. They can't deviate.
we also know that they're starting over.
which means they're gonna need some money.
Where's the closest shopping mall?
about 15 miles fm here.
Hey, Hotch, we know where they're going.
focus on the high-end department stores. They're bigger targets.
mom. Is this you?
ma'am!
hold it! Police!
set those bags down, rit now.
Kathy gray! Take that woman!
I said put the bags down. - Cuff her.
let's go.
what's wrong?
they've been stealing for years and they never get caught.
this was too easy.
Kathy, I can't help you if you're not going to be honest with me.
I already told you, I killed them.
all by yourself. - Yes.
well, I know that's not true. - It is.
how did you do it?
how did you abduct a child and control two adults while you slit their throats?
Oh, come on, you know she's not responsible for this.
I know we have a string of bodies, and she knows where her husband and son are.
you are the victim here. - No, she's not. She killed innocent people.
her family was murdered.
and now she's killing other people's.
Kathy, this is not your fault.
my name isn't Kathy. It's Sylvia.
no, it isn't.
your name is Kathy Gray.
and you were a beautiful little girl.
your mom and dad were murdered and you were kidnapped.
do you recognize yourself there?
you see?
I'm sick of this!
then leave us alone! - Where are your husband and son?
look at me, Kathy. Don't listen to him.
they stole your life. Let me help you get it back.
that little girl is better off with my son than any man she could meet in your society.
I'm sure you raised him very well.
tell me about your own mother.
I've already told you everything.
I killed them, all by myself.
how's it going so far?
they're trying to crack her by reminding her of the girl she used to be.
I hope this good cop/ bad cop routine works.
if her family gets away, we've lost that little girl forever.
you're lying.
Kathy-- - My name isn't Kathy!
Yes, it is. Your name is Kathy Gray.
you're from Vienna, Virginia.
tell me where your husband and son are so I can help you get your life back.
want to see what you did? - Hey, don't show her those.
if she killed them herself, she can see it again.
serial killers like to relive their crimes. Did you know that?
this is geoff Hale.
he died from a strong, decisive cut. I think that was your husband.
Nancy Hale, her wound was more tentative. This was your son, right?
I'm sure by the time he teaches his own son how to kill, his hand will be steady.
OK, stop-- - This is the Robillard family.
Kathy, you don't have to look at that.
do you want to see some more?
I don't know what that is.
then look closely!
you don't recognize your own mother and father?
see? This is the tentative cut your future husband made while he slit your mother's throat.
where are your husband and son?
Cate Hale is only alive because of you, Kathy. Isn't that
your--your husband wanted to kill her, And you didn't.
no.
how does that make you feel?
to know that he was willing to kill that little girl?
that he would have been willing to kill you, too?
they murdered your family, Kathy, and they took you in, - But you were never really one of them. - No.
you were just a breeder.
I won't betray my family.
your little boy is only 10.
there is a chance he could get out of custody when he's 18,
but that's only if we get to him.
I love my family.
then tell us where your son is - She's ready.
and we can all help him together.
OK, come on, give her a second.
I don't know who those people are.
it's a list of every known fence in Huntsville.
and you're gonna tell us who your husband took the goods to.
Coles Rudzinski, Pete Shernit, - Come on, give her a minute to do the right thing.
Matt Thorne, Brent Woodhouse... - Ok, I can't stop him, Kathy.
this is it. This is your last chance to make things right.
Morris Collins-- - stop!
Morris Collins. - Ok.
I won't tell you.
you just did.
the boy's not with him.
where are the children?
I'll only tell you if you let me see my son.
FBI! Hands in the air! Hands in the air!
get on your knees! Down on the ground! Now!
you know, we got a long list of girls to go through with you.
in history, warriors invaded towns, killed the men, women, and boys,
but kept the girls for themselves.
you exist because your ancestors did what was needed for u to survive.
get him out of here. - You'll never find my boy!
we already have.
come on, come on.
it's just you now.
you're going to be strong.
I love you, Puyule.
what did you tell him?
OK, Kathy, no.
sheriff, get that videotape. We need to get it to a translator.
you got it.
the translation should be here in a few minutes. - Good.
the little girl's aunt and uncle are on their way here from Birmingham.
they'll be here in a few hours.
and also, I--I just spoke with JJ.
she'll be at her desk by the time we get back to Quantico.
she has 3 more weeks of maternity leave.
I know, but she's ing to be back.
and, honestly, I'm...
ready to get back to counter-terrorism. It's... Where i'm needed.
they're lucky to have you.
may I say something? - Sure.
this team is like a family.
and families take on the traits of their leaders.
you don't show much emotion.
meaning what?
I've sat at JJ's desk and I've looked at some of the worst things I've ever seen just trying to do half her job.
I hope you don't take her for granted.
I don't.
we got the translation. - What did she say?
don't tell them about your brothers.
how many brothers do you have?
mario Puzo wrote, "the strength of a family,
like the strength of an army, is in its loyalty to each other.
you're almost 10. You're becoming a man.
are you ready?
I love you, Puyule.
I love you, too.
Giddy-Up. - Well, it's about time.
I promise I will make it up to you.
now, tell me what you want.
I want...
I can do that.
what are you doing?
Hey, lover.
tonight? Yeah. I'm wide open.
2 a. m? You like to make me wait, don't you?
you want the usual?
uh, so where do you want to meet? The Cutler.
I think I can do that. Ok.
look, mom, look what I can do. I can do it myself.
Hi, dad.
Hotchner.
agent, this is Patrick Jackson, attorney general down in Texas.
Yes, sir, what can I do for you?
I got a case here in Dallas and...
well, your director thought you might be the person for a consult.
could you forward the details to Jennifer Jareau, our liaison?
not your team, Agent Hotchner. Just you.
what's the reason for that, sir?
you'll be briefed on the ground.
could you send details about the case or the unsub?
it's not the unsub you need to worry about. It's the lawyers.
how soon can you be here?
does the name Hoyt Ashford ring a bell?
investment banker? - Close. Hedge fund manager.
you might have seen him on the talk shows all red in the face,
saying the real estate crisis wasn't a big thing.
I did see his public apology on the news channels when it was.
Yeah, well, that was unfortunate, 'cause now his lawyers want to classify this as suicide.
we kept the scene preserved.
your consult might buy us some time.
well, most men don't take viagra before they kill themselves.
does he have a wife? - At home, with the kids.
so, mistress or prostitute?
agent Hotchner, what I'm about to tell you is confidential information.
it's not to be included in any reports.
every Wednesday, Ashford withdrew $10, 000 out of a fund in cash.
today was no different.
so, high-end prostitute.
we interviewed the valet, the concierge. Nobody saw her.
well, that's not surprising. These women know how to be discreet.
you'd think the profit margins in the toilet, they'd show a little restraint.
so this isn't the first?
we think it's the second.
I am going to call my team. - Understood.
but there is a reason why I wanted you here first.
I got 3 judges and one state senator asking if I'm sure I have a case.
you poke around, this type of woman, this type of lifestyle, people get edgy, call in favors.
I'm sorry, but the politics of this are your problem.
Yes, they are. And of course we all want her stopped.
you just don't want any big fish caught in the net.
that's how it's got to be, r bureau involvement.
local murders, local case.
all right. I just need a place for my team to set up and all your case files.
we don't have as much on Michael Stanton, but I'll send it over.
I'll be in touch in the morning. - Thank you, Agent Hotchner.
what floor? - Uh, 16. Thank you.
long night?
uh, kind of. Yeah.
Yeah. Me, too.
these tokyo markets are killing me.
excuse me. - Good night.
darling.
an outlaw, who controls the sexual channels between nature and culture.
Camille Paglia.
female serial killers are a fascinating field.
we don't have much information on them,
but what we do know involves throwing the rules completely out the window.
signature, for instance. They don't torture or take trophies.
because there's no sexual gratification when a woman kills.
exactly. Murder is the goal. They don't have to do anything extra.
so, basically, women are more efficient at killing.
historically, they have had body counts in the hundreds.
so assuming that the job is the stressor, what are some of the reasons prostitutes kill their customers?
money, drugs, post-traumatic stress disorder.
at some point, every call girl, no matter how well paid, gets coerced into an activity she didn't consent to.
aileen Wuornos used to purposefully stage paid sexual encounters
as an excuse to murder men she thought would rape her.
but Wuornos was psychotic and disorganized.
I think this girl's poisoning them before she has sex with them.
she's using tetra-methylene- disulfotetramine.
it's a popular rat poison in china, easily soluble in alcohol.
poison is the perfect m. o. Quiet, quick,
and the victims never see it coming because they think they're getting lucky.
does that mean something to you?
well, at $10, 000 a night, these men are paying for discretion as well as sex.
she has a history with them.
they see her repeatedly.
she didn't decide to kill them in the moment.
she walks in with the intent to kill them and she's doing it before she sleeps with them.
so she's not just organized, she's also methodical.
she decides early which one of her clients are worth killing and which aren't and she plans accordingly.
maybe the victims all share the same fetish.
both victims were in their 50s, highly visible.
careful about their image.
I mean, if they were kinky in the same way, they'd go to great lengths to hide it.
and we're facing a corporate culture they'll do everything it can to keep us out.
actually, I had some luck there.
Hoyt Ashford's wife isn't too happy with how he died.
she's agreed to talk to us?
Yeah, but because every silver lining has a dark cloud, uh, the hedge fund released a statement.
uh, "Ashford died peacefully in his home"," according to lawyer David Madison.
they're already trying to close ranks.
does that language sound familiar to anyone else?
what do you mean?
the press release from the first victim.
uh, "according to company lawyer, Stanton died peacefully in his home.""
Prentiss and Morgan, start with the wife. See if you can get her to open up.
JJ, call the lawyers and tell them I want to meet with both of them.
you want to play them off each other?
I think one of them wrote both press releases.
let's see which one calls us back.
babe.
what time is it?
if you leave now, you can get your kids to school.
thank you, Agent Hotchner.
the phoenix police announced the suspect responsible for the deaths of 5 phoenix officers had been caught. That is not the case.
the killer is still at large.
Mrs. Ashford, we're very sorry about our husband.
I've been getting nothing but condolences all day.
I feel like a hypocrite for accepting them, knowing how he died.
we think your husband might have been targeted because of something...
sexual he did with this call girl.
we know this is hard, but is there anything you can tell us about what he liked?
in bed? I can sum it up in one word.
younger. - How much younger?
24, 25. It's... That was when I met him.
so, your age difference was part of the attraction?
are you kidding? It was the whole relationship.
Mrs. Ashford, no offense, but...
your husband spent a lot of money on this woman.
was there anything else at all that he liked from a younger woman besides the ego boost?
there's a certain kind of man, agent, for whom the only kind of sex that matters is the ego boost.
but in a marriage like ours, after a few years, it doesn't come voluntarily anymore.
you have to work at it.
or in my husband's case... Pay for it.
JJ, both lawyers said that they would be here at noon.
they both called back and they said they would meet you at the Manchester Center.
it's almost 12: 30 neither of them are here.
can you text me the numbers? I need to call.
agent Hotchner? - Never mind. She's here.
she? - Yes.
Ellen Daniels. Barswell Consulting.
ms. Daniels, we called two lawyers and neither of them was you.
they called me to consult on the press releases.
my firm specializes in strategic risk management for firms around the city.
you're a problem solver.
and we have a mutual one, don't we?
do you know who this girl is? - No.
well, one of your clients might. That's the point.
well, they're not gonna open up to either one of us about it.
then they're putting themselves at risk.
Yes, I understand that, but you see, my hands are tied.
none of these men are going to admit that they have a professional girlfriend.
I can subpoena their financial records.
then I would have to file about a year's worth of injunctions to stall you.
now, who needs that kind of hassle?
ms. Daniels, this is not a game.
I need a phone number, if not of this particular girl, then someone like her, someone we can talk to.
no escort will agree to sit down with the FBI.
but I have something better for you, assuming you might be willing to overlook certain legal niceties.
do you want to buy a house?
no.
Yes, you do.
I don't get it. I thought Hotch said we were into meet a madam here.
actually, there's a lot of overlap between real estate and sex work.
property is a safe and inspection-free investment for large sums of cash.
your brownstone used to be owned by a gigolo.
Hello, you two!
are u the-- - isn't this neighborhood just fabulous?
and you're gonna love this house.
you two need lessons in faking it. I teach a class.
uh, I'm--I'm sorry. I just-- I want to be clear.
you are a madam, right? You arrange dates for escorts?
all I arrange are meetings.
what happens between two consenting adults when that meeting is over is something I'm not liable for. Now...
who wants a scone?
Oh, yes. We all know about this woman.
she's terrible for business.
I guess there's only so many men that can, uh, afford the service you provide.
well, that's certainly true.
but the way she's behaving, she's only hurting herself.
and why is that?
an escort's client list is the most important investment she has.
it's her daily income and her retirement package when she sells the list.
so she isn't working with a service, is she?
no madam would allow an escort to kill off the clientele.
what about the, um, type of work your employees do?
we're sort of operating under the assumption that this escort is, um, killing men who...
make her perform a... Specific sexual act.
what did you have in mind, sweetie?
I--I don't even-- I don't know.
if I may. I think you're looking at this all wrong.
start with this question--why would a man pay a woman 5 figures?
it's not for sex, is it?
of course you've got to be good in bed to be successful.
but that's the easy part.
what's the difficult part?
what men want more than the no strings attached sex is a therapist.
someone who will absorb the worst parts of their personalities.
their fears and their insecurities.
everything they can't take home to their wife.
that's what I groom my girls to do.
how to talk to these men. How to listen.
don't get me wrong. Deviancy comes with the territory.
I can't tell you how many men need to be submissive as an outlet from their extremely stressful jobs.
I can tell you that if the sex was the reason she was killing these men,
she would have broken long before she charged $10, 000.
so it isn't how these men act in bed, it's how they act out of it.
Jesse, what's your 20?
uh, I'm, uh, just starting my sweep.
Oh, my god.
victim was Joseph Fielding. He was the CFO here.
poisoned?
and staged.
she killed him in his office and then rolled him out here to be found.
the lipstick's new. - Done postmortem.
Reid said female serial killers don't leave a signature.
I think she did that just for us.
she's already exposed him at his most vulnerable. Now she wants to be noticed.
I'm allowed back.
which one of you is Aaron Hotchner?
I'm Hotchner.
Larry Bartlett. I represent Mr. Fielding in webster industries.
this is a closed crime scene, Mr. Bartlett.
Yes. I spoke to Ellen Daniels.
she said you're a very reasonable man.
escort him out, please. - No, wait. Please.
the press is outside and they can smell blood.
any way we can handle this discreetly?
we're not about to lie for you.
you don't have to lie. St don't comment.
excuse us.
is there any reason to go public yet?
validating her is exactly what she wants.
if we hold back, she's more likely to make a mistake.
he doesn't need to know that.
we need everything you have on Fielding.
bank accounts, tax records, emails, everything.
everything?
18 cars, 6 houses, and 3 boats.
can you even boat in Dallas?
you know, when you're talking out that much money, 10 grand for a call girl is like deciding where to go for dinner.
are you there, Garcia?
affirmative.
I have half a million over here for something called the bat cave.
and here's a picture of him as fetish Batman.
that is wrong.
is there anything this guy didn't like to spend money on?
Yeah, his ex-wives. Fielding was married 4 times.
he didn't have prenups the first two, but he did everything he could to cut off his ex-wives.
are there children involved?
Yes, with 3 of the wives.
Hoyt Ashford was married a few times, too, wasn't he?
you know, considering that when Kevin takes me to dinner and a movie,
he defaults on his student loans, this amount of money is sick.
what did you find?
well, all 3 of our dearly departed rich guys were embroiled in bitter court battles
over how much to pay in alimony and child support,
and even when the court ruled in the wife's favor, which was almost always,
these 3 charmers just, you know, decided not to pay.
Garcia, can you generate a list of high-profile Dallas CEOs who are holding out on their ex-wives?
one loaded losers list, Dallas edition, comin' at ya.
Penelope out.
so why would a prominent businessman who could easily pay child support refuse to?
for this type of overachieving personality,
paying money after the marriage ends probably offends him.
they're spending tens of thousands on an escort,
but they won't drop a dime on their wife and kids? That's cold.
narcissistic, self-absorbed, a pathological avoidance of paternal responsibilities.
meanwhile, most prostitutes come from broken homes, she's listening to pillow talk.
could serve as some sort of trigger.
how their ex-wives are cheating them out of money, how their kids are nagging them.
everything that these men take for granted and that she never had.
well, should I assemble the police for a profile?
I just don't think it's gonna help.
she lives in a completely different world than they do.
same with the news-watching public.
and the CEOs who sleep with her won't admit to it.
like I couldn't even get past the team of lawyers protecting them.
what if we give the profile to the corporate lawyers?
they've cleaned up after her, even if they don't realize that they've seen this woman.
because every time we've approached them, they've circled the wagons.
what makes you think this is going to be any different?
because she's putting them at risk, too.
we're looking for a white woman between the ages of 25 and 30.
she's paid between 10 and $15, 000 per session,
and she's very well versed in the world of money and privilege.
even though she's a call girl, she doesn't look like one.
she could pass as a business woman or a co-worker.
you've probably written up her personal expenses as losses.
shoes, jewelry, clothing.
your bosses pay her in cash, but they may also be paying her in other ways
taking care of her, a new car, paying for her medical bills, even.
she probably did not grow up with a father figure,
and she is now turning that rage toward clients who walk out on their families.
what's going to happen once this woman is caught?
she'll be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
what about the other men she's sleeping with, the ones she doesn't kill?
what about them? - Will they be prosecuted?
right now we're concentrating on stopping her from killing again.
that's all well and good, but our employers are going to ask us about the risks involved in cooperating with an FBI investigation.
tell your employers that the risk is not only a physical one.
she's compromising privileged information as well.
after she sleeps with these men, they talk to her.
it's part of the release they get in seeing her.
all that dirty laundry you've worked so hard to cover up-- she knows it.
as long as she's out there, it's not just your clients that are vulnerable.
your firms are, too.
excuse me.
I'm Allison Barnes.
I'm a lawyer at webster industries where Joseph Fielding worked.
this is really not the time.
we'd like to hear what she has to say. Go ahead, Ms. Barnes.
a while back, I, um, looked at some paperwork that Mr. Fielding filed about a penthouse downtown.
I asked him what he'd be using it for, and he just kind of chuckled and said it was for a friend.
is that the kind of information you're looking for?
do you have an address?
Trent? - Yes. That's me.
thank you for meeting me here.
no, please, thank you.
may I sit? - Yes. Oh, god, yes. Of course.
so, let me explain something.
nothing's going to happen today.
we are just gonna chat and get to know each other,
and then we'll make an appointment for later in the week.
so, just... Relax. Ok?
Yeah. No.
believe it or not, this is me... Relaxed.
wine? - Sure.
I've never done anything like this before. - Trent.
could I see a list of 82 bordeaux?
what I'm trying to say is that...
it's been a while since I've been out on... A date.
when did your wife die?
how did you know?
I just do.
she had ovarian cancer. 8 months ago. She...
Oh, I'm sorry. Boy, this must really be sexy, huh?
you are not gonna say the wrong thing or scare me away.
I am here for you.
I almost didn't show up.
how come?
cause I was nervous. And...
my lawyers told me about this thing.
what thing?
apparently, there's this girl-- woman--like you...
who's been killing her clients.
Really?
my lawyers met with the FBI.
this woman targets CEOs and big spenders.
how awful. - Yeah.
somebody's already spilled the beans about a penthouse she has.
it's just a matter of time till they catch her.
and when they do, there'll be...
a lot of big men in trouble.
well, my guys seem to think they got the FBI in their pocket.
they won't release any names. And if they do...
we'll take care of them.
the FBI knows how to play ball.
Trent... Let's get out of here.
I thought there were rules.
I am making an... Exception.
you got anything? - No.
and she seems too smart to leave a receipt laying around.
Yeah. Ruins the mystique.
she's gotta be whatever the customer wants.
Hey, look at this.
she's got a lot of high-end designer jewelry here, and then this.
it's way too small to be an adult's.
she probably kept it from her childhood.
Oh, it's a purity ring.
by wearing it, you promise to save yourself for marriage.
she broke that promise a long time ago.
Hey, Prentiss.
got a whip?
antique first editions on the bookshelves.
and porno in the DVD player.
nothing identifiable. No pictures, no sense of personality.
her lifestyle is completely disposable.
well, these aren't just for show.
the spines are cracked. Somebody's read these.
who reads Voltaire in French?
someone with good taste. Probably well-educated.
you know, we profiled that she learned to fake privilege.
what if she's not faking it?
you're saying maybe she came from money the whole time?
maybe.
Prentiss should answer. If it's a customer, she'll get more information out of them.
unless she's calling in for her messages.
Yeah, Garcia, we're getting a call to this line. Can you work some magic?
I don't have a trap-and-trace in place yet. Give me a few.
I'm gonna stay on the line. She's gonna work it.
Prentiss, get ready to vamp.
Hi, it's me. You know what to do.
Aaron. I know you're up there. Pick up.
Hello?
I'm at a disadvantage. You seem to know my name, but I don't know yours. Can we start there?
I thought I could trust you, Aaron.
who says you can't? - I want to.
I even looked you up online. Is that strange?
no. It's flattering to be noticed by a woman like you.
and I thought you were so... Upstanding.
I watched the presentation you gave on school shootings. I found it posted on Youtube.
and for a moment, I actually thought there were still good people in the world.
but I've disappointed you, haven't i?
just like all the other men in your life who've walked out on their families, who deserve to be punished.
did you walk out on your family?
no. My wife left me.
do you have kids?
I have a son.
how often do you see him?
I try to see him every week.
do you see him every week?
no, I don't get there as often as I want.
I believe you. But don't compare yourself to the men I see.
you are nothing like them.
you're just another whore. - How am I a whore?
you come when called. You do their bidding.
my guys seem to think they got the FBI in their pocket.
in hotels you take the side elevator to avoid crowds,
while the men who pay your salary walk across the ivory marble foyer into their cars.
I'm in on the land line, triangulating the cell.
give me like 60 seconds.
but I'm just frustrating you, aren't i?
what do you mean?
well, you want to show the world all these bad men and my investigation's just getting in your way.
no, Aaron. You're not doing your job!
you don't want to arrest me, you don't want me in custody, because you're in their pocket.
we'll take care of them.
you just want me to disappear, just like they do.
truthfully, I'm only interested in finding you.
you've been betrayed so many times, you don't know who to trust,
and that's why that first murder felt so good.
but each one since has been less and less satisfying.
you know that's going to continue. Am I right?
Yeah.
come to me and turn yourself in.
I will make sure that you get the help you need.
I won't let you disappear.
if we met under different circumstances...
I could believe that.
I won't let you cover this up.
Garcia, talk to me. - Oh, my god, was that
Garcia, focus.
Hello?
channel 9 news room.
I just heard gunshots in a parking lot.
corinth and Michigan.
I think somebody might be dead.
got it! 1818 Corinth Avenue.
get back!
don't compare yourself to the men I see.
you are nothing like them.
you're just another whore.
her use of the word whore is interesting.
it suggests she's trying to disassociate herself from her actions.
but she's become more personal with the murders.
she's changed her m. o. From poison to a gun.
and she changed her victimology.
Trent Rabner was faithful to his wife until she died.
they didn't have kids.
her whole justification for who's worth killing and who isn't is gone.
she's obviously devolving.
this is gonna be ugly.
she's the type who could go on a spree and take out anyone she sees as a target.
could we go to the end just before she pulls the trigger?
well, you want to show the world all these bad men and my investigation's just getting in your way.
no, Aaron. You're not doing your job!
you don't want to arrest me, you don't want me in custody, because you're in their pocket.
you just want me to disappear, just like they do.
who's "they"? - The mean she sleeps with, I'm assuming?
no, it's bigger than that now. She's lumping Hotch in with the lawyers.
so maybe it's anyone in a position of power who could cover this up. Cover her up.
the purity ring you found-- you said it was tiny?
only a little girl could wear it.
she wouldn't buy that for herself. It was a gift.
maybe she's talking about her father.
well, if her father was anything like these CEOs, he probably walked out on her, too.
OK, so, you're rich, you decide to start sleeping with men who are like your father to get back at him.
how do you go about finding clients?
could she have started with the service?
she wouldn't need to.
the madam says that she trains these girls how to act around these men.
this unsub already knows how to do that.
she said something else, too.
she said that your client list was like your 401k.
you sell it when you retire.
so maybe our unsub bought her client list from another call girl.
it makes sense. They're expensive names.
only someone who came from money could afford it.
so who's recently retired?
you're kidding.
you keep tabs on who your clients sleep with.
you know who got out of the game.
you're asking me to violate attorney-client privilege.
we're asking you to help us catch a killer.
well, let's say that your profile is correct and she is the daughter of my client.
if I do this, I'm gonna need immunity on the back end.
come on, boys, give it up.
I mean, you two know how this game is played.
Yes, we do. So here's the deal.
give us the information we want or I'll arrest you on the spot for obstruction of justice.
and while you're sitting in Dallas central booking waiting to make your one phone call,
I'll have the entire white collar division from the FBI here from quantico,
and they'll turn your offices upside down until we find what we want.
that's my offer.
I'd take that if I were you.
yes?
we're looking for Katherine.
you have the wrong house.
we're not interested in you.
we're looking for the woman who bought your list.
Oh, honey, go play with your toys, ok?
come in. - Thank you.
her name is megan. Megan kane.
and her father was a client of yours?
Andrew. He was one of my 8 regulars.
he's a VP at Ebbett Oil now, I think.
I saw him for 6 years.
and does your son... - No.
after I retired, I... Wanted something good in my life.
6 years is a long time to see one call girl.
most men only have room for one affair at a time.
how did Megan know about you?
andrew left his wife because of me.
of course, he... Married someone else, but...
I wasn't surprised when Megan knocked on my door.
you must have been surprised she wanted your list.
Megan had all kinds of opportunities in life.
didn't you wonder why she wanted to follow your career path?
um, Megan didn't want to be a call girl.
she didn't?
she wanted me to go away.
she said that after I ruined her parents' marriage that I ruined her life, too.
she bought my list so that nobody else would.
so here's what we know about Megan Kane.
her parents divorced 8 years ago.
after the divorce, she traveled internationally. We're not sure when she came back, - Long night? - but she kind of fell off the grid,
which is easier to do when you're making tens of thousands of dollars a night.
Garcia put a trace on her father, communication, accounts, the whole nine.
I also forwarded the picture to Dallas P. D.and upscale hotels.
excuse me. - Good night.
I saw her 2 nights ago in the elevator of my hotel.
call Ebbett Oil. Tell Andrew Kane I need to meet with him as soon as possible.
you have the wrong woman.
no, we don't.
is this how the FBI does their job now, making random accusations against people they don't even know?
she kept the purity ring you gave her?
we found it in a penthouse that one of her customers rented for her.
Andrew, don't say anything.
when you cut off your ex-wife, you cut off Megan, too.
we still think you can help us if you can contact Megan.
we're done here.
we have a tail on Kane at his home and office.
we sure this is gonna work?
he knows where Megan is. He'll contact her.
to protect his reputation if nothing else.
guys, I might have something.
andrew Kane just reserved a room at the Wilmore Hotel, room 2257 to be exact.
can I get an ick-ick-icky on making an appointment with your own daughter?
Megan won't show up until she's sure Kane's there.
JJ, tell nobody to move until we get there.
we haven't seen Kane or his daughter down here.
there's a lot of entrances. We could have missed one.
stay where you are.
FBI. Don't move.
he told me to show up here. - They could be anywhere.
let's go.
Hello, daddy.
how could you?
how could I what? Embarrass you?
fail you?
my god, Megan. Those men-- they were good men.
those men? Let me tell you about how good those men were, dad.
I'm not going to listen-- - Hoyt Ashford liked to play pretend.
except the bruises that he left weren't pretend.
you stop it. - Michael Stanton
you spoke with him at a conference, didn't you?
do you know who he liked to watch me with?
I will not let you talk to me this way. - I even asked about you.
I wanted to know what it was that these women did that was so much better than mom.
shut your mouth!
that's what they told me you liked.
there are 4 luxury hotels in the area that the unsub frequents.
we could split up, but we'll go in blind.
ivory marble. She mentioned it on the phone.
the men who walked through the ivory marble foyer.
the Chase Regent. - Are you sure?
andrew liked it there. He said that the staff was very discreet.
all right, let's set up a perimeter when we get there. Nobody gets in or out.
the FBI knows who you are. - I know.
if you want to punish me... Fine.
but don't do it by destroying yourself.
let me protect you. - How?
we'll turn you in. My lawyers can post bail. We'll get you out of the country.
Oh, of course. Ship me off, let me be somebody else's problem.
for god's sake, Megan.
you're my little girl.
I love you.
please. Please.
let me save your life.
I'm scared.
I know.
it'll be ok.
will you stay with me? - Yes.
do you promise? - Yes.
Oh, yes.
I need something. - What?
your client list.
what are you gonna do with it? - Hide it.
if the FBI finds it, they'll prosecute you for all 4 murders.
you'll never be released.
hold on. Just give me a second.
shut your mouth!
Megan. We're out of time.
this is it. It's my contacts, my clients.
everything.
I'll see you at the police station.
we'll get through this.
easy. - You sure?
it's over. She knows it.
I'll call 911.
Hello?
Megan. - Nothing l change.
they'll just go back to doing whatever they want and keep getting away with it.
not if I have anything to do with it.
who was it who said, "you don't pay a prostitute for sex, you pay her to leave afterwards"?
it was Dashiell Hammett.
it doesn't make sense.
the men always leave first.
I'd give anything to see his face right now.
no.
how could your wife have ever left someone like you?
you're the first man I ever met who didn't let me down.
will you stay with me? - Yes.
promise? - Promise.
sir, roll your window down. Roll your window down now.
dallas companies were rocked today as a list was found of men who were rumored...
andrew Kane resigned amid allegations of ties to an escort -- who was reportedly killing her clients. --Let's talk.
the attorney general insisted that he was not responsible for the leak of the clients' names.
Kane refused to comment, but sources say he was the father.
I'm telling you, you're gonna love it.
do you think so? - Yeah.
look, it's great. I saw it forever ago on vhs.
campy. - Fun.
2. Thank you.
enjoy the show, you guys. - Thank you.
enjoy the show.
Ah, don't worry, it's not that scary.
that's lame.
I--I mean it's-- It's kind of scary, But, uh, mostly funny, you know?
how funny? - Well, it's...
just don't spill it, Jesse.
where do you want?
it doesn't matter to me.
there? - No, that's too close.
thought it didn't matter. - Well, just not too close.
you know you're gonna fall asleep anyhow.
OK, stop. Air.
and I'm getting razor burn.
what?
Oh, my god!
fire! Fire! Come on, let's go. Get up. Come on! Fire!
get the door!
move, man! There's the fire exit!
Cathy, Run! Run!
help! Somebody help us! - This way!
get the door! Hurry!
help! Help! Help! - Somebody help us!
mom! - Jesse!
Jesse, where are you?! - Cathy!
get us out! Somebody get us out!
this is news footage from a movie theater In royal, Indiana, population 2, 000.
earlier tonight 19 people were killed.
and they're sure it's arson?
Yeah. 2 days ago the same thing happened at the local recreation center.
12 victims, no survivors.
I heard about that. - Yeah, it was all over the news.
there were some details that didn't make the news.
a week and a half earlier there were some fires at a convenience store, a local restaurant.
luckily, it was after hours and no one was hurt.
so whoever set these went from no victims to 31 in 2 weeks.
that's a hell of an escalation.
why didn't they call us in sooner?
the local police and fire department knew they were dealing with an arsonist,
but they had no idea he'd become a killer.
most arsonists don't. They just like setting fires.
any deaths that occur are almost always accidental.
31 victims is not an accident.
the police chief knows he made a mistake.
and he learned the hard way that even though not all arsonists are killers,
they do have one thing in common,Once they start, they can't stop.
Tennessee Williams said, We all live in a house on fire.
no fire department to call, no way out.
based on the limited population of royal,
the unsub is most likely a local male Between the ages of 17 and 30.
what, arson is a sexist industry?
for the most part, yeah. Only 12% of arsonists are female.
apparently women just aren't inclined to burn things.
let's go with the numbers. Focus on males.
well, we can scratch hero complex off the list.
he hasn't left anyone to save.
Yeah, but we can't rule out firefighters and other first responders.
how's about I do a background check on all local firefighters and emts?
and flag anyone with a history Of being first on the scene.
or anyone with a juvenile record That includes vandalism or small nuisance fires.
I will look at everything from firebug to flamethrower.
did you check out the news footage?
I want the word out that we'd like to see any personal videos or photos of the fire.
arsonists like to watch, and if our unsub stuck around,
maybe somebody will recognize him.
I'm on it.
locals find anything in their call logs That resemble the unsub's m. o?
I mean, he may have staged practice runs.
according to the fire chief's report There was nothing similar in the past year.
Garcia, extend your search statewide.
the unsub may have done his practicing far enough away so as not to arouse suspicion.
I will cast a wide net, sir . - Thank you.
I grew up in a small town.
people are gonna assume anyone we question is guilty.
the last thing we want is for this to turn into a witch hunt.
it's exactly what this is.
we're just gonna have to keep the locals from realizing it.
Garcia, I want you to find out everything that you can about the 31 victims, and I don't mean just their paper trail.
I need to know everyone related to them,
everybody they owed money to, Everybody they had an argument with.
sir, if I'm hearing you right, you're saying I'm the witch hunter.
that's exactly what I'm saying.
chief Carlson, Agent Jareau, this is agent Hotchner.
thank you for coming.
I know I should have called you in earlier.
so anything you need, anything at all, you got it.
what we're going to need most is your help.
it's a horrible tragedy, and it's gonna take Everyone working together to prevent another one.
you think he's gonna try to do it again?
we know he will. And with his escalating timeline, It's gonna be soon.
we, uh,We didn't have enough room in the hospital For everyone.
this--this way, please.
doc Rawlings.
you're the fbi agents. Well, thank god Carlson called you.
I'm agent Hotchner, this is agent Jareau.
that's Mary Elise. She lost her husband.
that's Alice Starrett with chief Carlson.
her parents were both at the movie theater.
Mike--His oldest son and his girlfriend were there.
so was my nephew.
everybody in the room lost somebody.
when I first heard about it, I just came right here.
I had my nurses bring equipment, set up triage.
nobody needed it. They were-- They were all dead.
every single one of them.
I wish I could tell you this is the worst of it, but I can't.
when he strikes again, he's gonna be aiming for even more victims.
my god.
you need to send everybody home.
large gatherings like this are a bad idea.
all right. - Dr. Rawlings.
when I spoke to the police chief, He said that you know everyone in royal.
well, pretty much. I grew up here.
I inherited my father's practice.
I delivered 11 of those people lying in there.
there is a strong probability that the killer is local.
you think somebody from royal did this?
it's usually the case.
we want to handle this investigation as gently as possible,
without pointing fingers.
what we're asking you to decide is what's more important,
people's privacy or their safety?
most of the victims died of smoke inhalation, thank god.
a few of them were trampled.
my cousin Gary and his wife Linda.
if you need some time.
we're talking gasoline and matches.
and this was the point of origin.
the second one was in the lobby?
this one burned the longest. Slower, too.
less oxygen, less fuel.
he used a lot more gas in the lobby. Place went up like a haystack.
what about the sprinklers?
bastard turned off the main water line.
you know, the unsub could have set this fire first.
lobby burned harder and faster, Forcing the victims out this way,
where he'd already blocked the exit.
and where the smoke from the slower-Burning fire had already built up.
and whoever did do this knew that even if the fire department Got here in time to stop the fires,They still wouldn't have been able to save them.
me and daniel are both volunteers.
the whole company is.
got about 20 firefighters, plus our own ladder truck and pumper.
an emt runs a 2-Person crew 24/7.
we managed to get it out pretty fast.
not fast enough. All those people.
who would have so much hate?
someone whose rage has been building for years.
but what he did, I...
the unsub knew exactly what he was doing.
he's been practicing for a long time.
nuisance fires, vandalism.
he may have even burned himself.
well, that sounds like every teenage boy who's ever grown up in royal.
I don't know if you noticed, but there's really not a lot to do here.
you have our reports. All the records are in there.
maybe so, But we all know there are times when things don't get reported.
times when you're...
just trying to protect someone,
just trying to, um, make the situation go away.
we're just trying to help people out.
sometimes the best way to do that is to forget that it ever happened.
we're gonna need to know about those times.
FBI
I have been through every piece of footage I could find.
no one sticks out at the fires.
no one appears to be inappropriately voyeuristic. No one with bandages.
Garcia? - Yeah.
no firebug firefighter, no flammable juvie records,
however, of the 128 reported instances of petty larceny and vandalism in the last year,
there are a few names that sort of stick out,
so I'm emailing you those photos.
I also have a pattern of small gasoline fires about 300 miles away.
a town called Franklin.
got a, uh, trash can fire, a christmas tree,
and an abandoned shed. And I sent you that file.
given the 500-Mile search radius,
there's bound to be a certain percentage of nuisance fires.
we can't necessarily attribute that to our unsub.
with a gasoline accelerant.
our unsub and this guy. Nice work, Garcia.
what about the victims?
Well,given that i've had less than 8 hours, i can't really.
I appreciate the time constraint. What have you found?
uh, a mixture of ages and genders. Mostly local.
a cousin visiting from a nearby town.
is there any crossover between the victims and the 2 towns, Garcia?
Hey, it's a little teeny tiny town. There's nothing but crossover. Um.
Alex Nagel--He was killed in the rec center.
now, not only was Nagel an upstanding member of the local church,
he also owned quite a bit of real estate in royal, Including the movie theater.
windy Kennedy was killed at the movie theater.
she was a single mom. She worked a double shift at the local discount store.
and she still managed to find time to volunteer at the rec center.
I also have a third-Grade teacher, third cousins,
and at least 3 potential affairs.
you're gonna have to start weeding out some of these, Garcia.
third cousins and religious affiliations are probably not gonna help us.
I need to know who had enemies,
who had secrets, who was a target.
Oh, with all due respect, sir,
my brain muscles are comfortable with being intuitive with information, not people.
looking at people like that Is not part of my job description.
I'm not a profiler.
well, you're gonna have to be. We don't have much time.
you two look into the nuisance fires. Garcia, stay on the radio.
"yeah, though I walk through the valley "of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, For thou art with me.
you said large gatherings aren't a good idea, But this service Is not a target. The unsub wouldn't want to interrupt the grief he created.
but he may want to watch it.
we're looking for inappropriate behavior for the situation.
too much emotion, too little emotion.
someone who keeps to himself. Watching others' reactions.
someone who insinuates himself too closely Into someone else's grief.
we're focusing on known offenders with a propensity for arson.
Brian Miller, 18 years old,
and he's been vandalizing property for almost all 18 of them.
staff, they comfort me.
John Clayton, 27. He set fire to his neighbor's garage,
claimed it was an accident, but he filed a complaint the previous month
that the neighbor killed his dog.
thou anointest my head with oil.
my cup runneth over.
surely goodness and mercy Shall follow me all the days of my life.
and I will dwell in the house of the lord forever.
Yeah, jj.
people, please. Calm down.
I'm sure it's nothing.
Thanks.
he's not here.
this doesn't make sense. He should have been at the memorial.
he shouldn't have been able to resist seeing the damage he'd done.
captain. Hey, captain.
can I get a word?
it started in the kitchen.
looks like he came around to the back and tossed a cocktail through the window.
different delivery system. That's a big deviance from his m. o.
but perfect for this location.
I don't know, though.
with a space this small he shouldn't have been able to pour the gasoline without being noticed.
nobody saw a thing?
witnesses say they heard an explosion.
well, I guarantee he stuck around to watch.
boom.
the bar matches his previous locations.
it's another local hot spot.
only 5 victims this time. Why lower the body count?
there's something else that's different.
the front and back?
he really wanted to make sure nobody got out this time.
but why bother? No one made it out of the other ones.
maybe he knew the fire department would show up sooner.
Yeah, we're faster now. Practice makes perfect.
what the hell difference does it make?
and what good are you guys doing us?
you see chains, figure he didn't want anyone to get out.
I could have told you that.
we're not criticizing anyone.
our job is to look at the same things you do,
but to try to see them from a different perspective.
sure. - Look, all due respect, captain,
but you look at that chain and you say the killer wanted to make sure nobody got out, right?
we look at that chain and we see a little more.
that chain is different than the first two fires.
now, either we're looking at an entirely new arsonist
or this unsub wanted to make absolutely certain nobody got out.
now, if this is true, that means something changed.
maybe his emotions changed. Maybe his agenda. But something.
see, this chain tells us this is the fire that matters.
this fire is gonna help us catch this guy.
my father was chief here for over 30 years.
last 2 weeks I lost more folks that he did in his whole career.
agent prentiss?
sorry. - Chief, what do we know?
4 dead. The bartender Nancy is still hanging on.
how bad is she?
pretty bad. She was unconscious When they took her.
if we get a chance, we need to talk to her.
I was off duty,I heard it on the radio!
God, I'm sorry, Tina.
I just talked to him on the phone. He said he was coming home.
Tina's fiance Jason owned the bar.
he was inside when it all happened.
when's it gonna stop?
anything?
we got a completely different m. o.
assuming it's not a copycat,
we know why the unsub wasn't at the funeral.
someone in that bar was more important to him than anything else.
Morgan, call Garcia.
tell her we need to know absolutely everything there is to know
about these 5 victims and we need to know it now.
I'll go tell chief Carlson we want to talk to his officers.
Hello?
Hey, how's miss smart and sexy doing today?
fair warning, cupcake. As much as I love you And our witty banter, I am all out of witty and banter and am struggling with love.
what's wrong, baby?
I am standing at the crossroads of 31 lives and what I see is a train wreck.
you want a little tour? This is what I mean. Here we go.
flip Phillips-- He beat his wife. It went on for years.
although you wouldn't know it if you looked at the police reports,
because that's one of the perks of being the mayor.
david Alexander-- He sued his boss for $5 million over something totally lame,
and what makes it even more erotic Is he was sleeping with the boss' daughter.
and then there is-- Where is she?
Oh! One of the town councilwomen,
now, she had a terminally ill husband and also 3 boyfriends under the age of 20.
I want to believe that the world Is just teeming with awesome people,
but all of this is giving me great pause.
I want to go back to cyberspace.
I'm sorry, sweetheart, not yet. I got a few more names for you.
OK.
just, um, Please tell me they're still alive.
I wish I could do that, Garcia.
all of the first 4 fires-- The convenience store,
the restaurant, the rec center, and the movie theater,
are indicative of a revenge arsonist.
that's someone who's seeking retaliation
for an injustice, whether real or imagined.
revenge arsonists often target group headquarters,
such as churches or government buildings.
this unsub has chosen local gathering places
with large numbers of potential victims inside.
it's clear to us that he's chosen to target this community as a whole.
that tells us that the unsub is a local,
someone who lives or grew up in royal.
but he feels like an outsider.
as if this community has wronged him in some type of way.
these fires are just his way of striking back,
trying to draw attention to himself.
these fires not only killed innocent people,
they also gave the unsub a sense of power over the community.
but somehow those fires were lacking.
they didn't exact the correct measure of punishment or attract enough attention.
or they didn't attract the attention of the right person.
so with the bar fire, He didn't increase the number of victims.
he reduced them.
that's why the third fire is key.
he's not striking out at the community as a whole anymore.
he's now striking out at one or more individuals.
you're sure it's the same guy?
the odds of another arsonist in a town this small are almost negligible.
that's why we need to concentrate on these victims.
these 5 will hold the key.
so all we gotta do is just figure out Who would have wanted to hurt them.
it may not be that simple.
this type of rage tends to stem from things that people keep buried.
things they just don't talk about.
which is why we're gonna have to dig deeply.
understood.
excuse me.
how is she?
we couldn't even send her to the burn unit in gary.
it wouldn't have mattered. - We'll be brief.
Nancy. It's me.
the FBI is here.
Nancy, can you tell us what happened?
there was a crash,Then everything exploded.
cocktail.
what happened before that?
was there anything unusual or out of the ordinary?
did anyone come in or leave?
just Jason.
Jason, the owner?
he came for the money. Like always.
he's dead, isn't he?
Nancy, what about customers?
was there anyone there who seemed anxious or upset?
he would have kept to himself,
taken a seat away from the other customers.
maybe he was checking his watch or his cell phone.
there was a guy,He seemed angry.
he kept changing seats. - Ok. We have to stop.
who was that, Nancy? You know his name? - Now.
so tell us about the bar victims.
all right. Hilda and Roger Drake.
she was a teacher, he sold insurance.
friends, enemies?
Oh, no, nothing like that. They seemed sweet.
their biggest problem was finding baby names. Hilda was pregnant.
are you sure?
the m. e. hasn't even started yet.
no, people in royal take out ads.
lordy, lordy, looks who's 40.
ask Jane what she was doing at the American legion on friday night.
that's just wrong.
that's small-Town life for you.
your business is everybody's business.
there was a belly watch on Hilda.
uh, what about Eric Gall?
Oh, Eric. He was a boozer.
he spent most of his time at pop's place.
I've got a few drunk and disorderlies, but he seems harmless.
and given the amount of rounds he bought, It's safe to say the whole town love him.
it's Hotch.
Yeah, what's up?
OK. I got it.
OK, well, they managed to speak to the bartender.
according to her, there was a guy there before the fire.
he didn't speak to anybody and he kept switching seats.
she didn't seem to recognize him.
OK. Wait. So she knew the owner And the boozer,
and the husband wouldn't have gotten up and changed seats.
if the bartender didn't recognize him, maybe he's just not from royal.
that's not necessarily true.
what if she knew him and she just didn't realize it?
what, like a disguise?
the fire captain said the unsub knew the layout of the movie theater.
he used that knowledge to light the fire.
but at the bar, the unsub kept changing his seats.
which would give him a better view of the entrances and exits.
so he was studying the layout.
he wasn't familiar with the area.
what if he grew up in Royal and he moved away?
Garcia, what year was that bar built?
uh, the bar was built 5... 6 years ago.
and what about the movie theater?
the movie theater was built in the forties.
it was a single screen, they divided it 2 years ago.
rec center was built in the late seventies.
I'm gonna call Hotch.
Jason Elliot opened pop's place 6 years ago.
when he moved to Royal from Indianapolis.
Why? Does he have friends or family here?
none that I could find.
what about the bar? Did Jason buy it From someone, take over their business?
no. Jason started the bar himself.
he named it after his father,
who, by the way, was his sole beneficiary.
makes sense. He was single.
well, he was single, up until a couple days ago,
because 2 days ago, Jason married Tina Wheeler.
the emt.
Yeah. I had checked her out originally as one of the first responders, but her work records looked squeaky clean,
and so I let it go until I realized she'd married Jason,
and then I did some more aggressive digging,
which I should remind you you asked me to do,
and it turns out that tina's parents died in a fire when she was 5.
after they died, her and her brother Tommy.
were sent to live with their grandparents in Royal.
send us everything you have on them.
well, that's just it. I got...
I got plenty on Tina,
but I can't really find anything on her brother.
Tina, she, uh, she lived in Royal,
she went to a community college a few towns over,
got a degree, took a job, worked hard, married Jason.
Uh...wait... Tommy, it's like... He just disappeared.
find him, Garcia.
Lana Perry, please.
Hi. This is Penelope Garcia of the FBI.
I wanted to ask you some questions. You have a second?
Yes. I--I wanted to ask you some questions
about a student, uh, named Tommy Wheeler.
thank you. Thank you very much.
Oh, my god.
sir, I think I have something.
we believe Jason Elliot may have been the target.
the bartender said that Jason stopped by the bar
at the same time each day to pick up the cash and take it to the bank.
which would have made him an easy target for anyone who knew his schedule.
I don't get all this. Jason was a good man.
it may sound corny to you, but everybody loved him.
2 days ago, Jason Elliot married Tina Wheeler.
she told me about it yesterday. Uh...
all the tragedies made them not want to wait.
it's a damn shame.
what can you tell us about tina's brother tommy?
uh, nobody's seen him around here in more than 10 years.
uh, we actually think they may have.
they just might not recognize him.
how is that possible?
well, he's aged 10 years, and he'd make sure to go unnoticed.
little Tommy Wheeler. You remember him?
he and his sister Tina moved to Royal when he was 5.
doc Rawlings was his pediatrician.
apparently early medical records indicated Tommy may have been emotionally unbalanced.
Tommy was a little unstable.
his parents dying brought that out.
granted, I don't have a medical degree,
but my guess is, watching his parents die in a fire
didn't help Tommy's emotional well-being.
what about Tina? How did the fires affect her?
Uh,Tina wasn't as damaged by it as he was.
uh, she adjusted more quickly.
she was Tommy's lifeline.
she was more than that. In a situation like this,
no parents, new environment, and grandparents probably too old to take care of them,
Tina became Tommy's whole world.
sister, mother, family.
they were very close.
close enough that Tina distorted Tommy's love map.
the way an individual gives or receives love-- Their love map
is established by the age of 6.
with the death of the parents,
Tommy's love map revolved exclusively around Tina.
Yeah, it was like they were in their own little world.
by the time they were 8, they even had their own language.
it was a bit disturbing.
but understandable. Perfectly understandable.
maybe.
so what happened?
what do you think happened? People talked.
it's the only real occupation in royal.
there were rumors.
it was that Tommy and Tina were too close.
Tommy Wheeler! My god, that's your sister!
nothing was ever confirmed, though.
no, it wasn't. But, then, the truth didn't matter.
after the rumors started, Things got ugly.
people pointed fingers, Tommy got expelled from school.
based on nothing but hearsay.
not true. The school had cause.
no, they didn't. - Garcia.
I spoke to his teacher. She told me how the whole school and the whole town,
turned against him, based on nothing but a rumor.
Garcia-- - She also told me another rumor.
in this one, 14-Year-Old Tommy was beaten within an inch of his life By adults. Grown men.
I didn't hear about it until after the fact.
there was nothing I could do.
broken bones, punctured lung. All because of a rumor.
I couldn't go after anyone based on only my suspicions.
nobody was talking about it, not even Tommy.
I spoke to his grandparents and told them what to do.
Yeah. So they moved Tommy to a Colorado boarding school,
and they cut off all ties between him and his sister.
it was as if Tommy never even existed.
it was for the best. They would have killed him.
if what Garcia said is true, then this town's actions
went a long way towards makingTommy who he is.
we need to talk to Tina.
go on around, take the back. - Yes, sir.
Tina! It's me, Brad!
Morgan, find out if Tina showed up for work today.
clear!
nobody's here.
Yeah, Morgan.
Tina didn't show up for her shift. Thanks.
she left her cell phone.
you think it was Tommy?
yes?
put out an apb for Tommy and Tina.
close all roads in and out of Royal.
no, no, he loves her. He wouldn't hurt her.
according to his former teacher,
Tommy Wheeler enrolled in a Colorado boarding school under the name Thomas Boren.
that's his dead mother's maiden name.
I tracked down his records.
he was at that school for half a year before he landed in juvie,
where he resided for the next 3.
his psych evals during his stay were less than stellar.
so how mad do you think he is?
well, if I was him I'd be pretty mad.
Oh, god.
Garcia, the town did turn against him.
I mean, that's not an excuse.
no, not Tommy. Hotch.
I mean, he did tell me to dig, right? So I dug.
and, granted, i'm not supposed to have direct contact with the public
or purport myself as an FBI agent.
And--Ok, I'm definitely not supposed to accuse someone of a felony
or even a misdemeanor, especially when I don't have any actual evidence.
Oh, god. I did just what they did.
I--I based everything on a rumor.
I got sucked right in. I didn't mean to. I
Garcia, come on, baby. Stick to Tommy.
right. Sorry. Ok, uh...
he was released from juvie when he was 16. That's when the trail goes cold.
you couldn't find him?
no, I said the trail went cold, I didn't say it disappeared.
this is the part I'm actually good at.
whatever he did in the interim remains a mystery,
much to my chagrin, but at the age of 21,
thomas Boren re-emerged in Franklin, Indiana.
that's 300 miles away from Royal.
said Mr. Boren purchased copious amounts of gasoline 2 months ago.
it's not unusual to do in Indiana,
but Mr. Tommy Wheeler/Boren didn't own a farm.
the nuisance fires.
Roger that. And then after his little spending spree,
that's when the trail goes cold and I can't find him.
Yeah, Hotch.
all right.
there's still no sign of Tina.
he wants you to bring rawlings.
we've locked down the town and put out a statewide alert. So far, nothing.
where in royal would Tommy take his sister?
it's hard to say.
it's likely to be a place that's important to the both of them.
maybe a place that they went to together as kids.
I don't know. The only place I can think of Is their grandparents' old house,
but that was torn down years ago.
that's not gonna help us.
I've got pictures of her with the grandparents and friends.
nothing with Tommy.
Garcia was right.
after he was sent away, Tommy no longer existed, not even as a memory.
Tommy, please, what are we doing here?
I found Tommy.
or what she had left of him.
you mean everything to me. Everything.
you and I, we're-- We're soul mates.
they can't keep us apart anymore.
that's your sister!
they?
get off of her right now.
my god, Tommy.
all those people-- You killed them?
for you. For us. So we can be together.
don't you see that-- That's how it was meant to be.
just the two of us.
you killed Jason? - Don't say his name! Don't!
Hotch, I think we have something here.
what dance is this?
the, uh, spring formal.
they hold it every year at the community center.
may of '98. This was just before tommy was beaten and forced out of town.
is this dance something Tommy and tina would have gone to?
it's a big event.
all the kids go even if they don't have formal dates.
so they could have gone together?
Absolutely.
I need you to remember.
Tommy, don't. Don't do this.
we were together. We were happy.
Tommy, stop it! Please stop it!
you have to turn yourself in.
remember!
I remember.
it can be like this again.
we can be together, ok? Just like this.
no. We can't, Tommy. We can't! It isn't right!
it is!
it's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. I promise.
you belong with me. - No, I don't! No, I don't!
please! Let me go! - Tommy, let her go!
let her go, son! Let her go!
no.
I'll burn the whole town down.
no, you won't. Not if you love her.
look at her, Tommy. Look at her.
if you really love her, then let her go.
please, Tommy.
you don't want to hurt her, son.
I...love you.
I know.
I have loved to the point of madness.
that which is called madness.
that which to me is the only sensible way to love.
francoise Sagan.
you guys choose this,
turning people over like rocks,
and looking at all their creepy crawly things underneath.
and I get it. I do. It's the only way to catch them. But I want to see the good in people.
I choose to see the good in people.
And...getting into someone's mind
and trying to find the god-awful thing that happened to them
that made them do the god-awful thing to somebody else
has seriously impaired my ability to giggle,
and it makes my brain all wonky, and I don't like it.
Garcia. - Yes, sir.
I just wanted to thank you for your excellent work on this case.
and I understand that what you did was for you very difficult.
but your contributions are essential to the success of this team.
thank you, sir.
I know you see the good in people, Penelope.
always.
and I would never want you to change that.
how are you feeling today?
you let me smoke.
what more can I ask for?
most patients have a hard time coping with new surroundings.
they probably believe they'll be released.
I'm not so naive.
you don't believe you'll be getting out?
would you let me out?
I'd like to talk about Adam.
he's still missing.
so I've heard.
will you help us find him? - No.
why not? What more do you need to hide?
I'm not hiding anything.
and I think the better question would be, what are you looking for... Dr. Reid?
I think you know what I'm looking for.
I want to hear you say it.
I am looking for Adam.
just because you caught me doesn't mean you'll find him.
you're not that smart.
this isn't about being smart.
this is about doing the right thing.
I did the right thing.
Chandler, looks like I got the night off after all.
Yeah, what she don't know only makes it that much better.
Yeah, sounds like a plan.
right. I'm gonna change and I'll, uh... I'll hit you back.
Hey, I saw you earlier, didn't I?
my name's Dan.
Where's Madison? I thought you were off.
Oh, she wasn't feeling well, so I sent her home.
listen, we had another early checkout, so could you turn it over before you clock out?
what, I'm a cleaning lady now?
I'm your boss, and you'll be whatever I want you to be.
OK. What room?
Daniel Keller, 21, a junior at Benjamin Franklin University.
he was killed last night while spring breaking in south padre island.
C. o. d. asphyxiation.
he was the second victim to be murdered there in the past 3 nights.
the first was William Browder, also on spring break, c.o. d. asphyxiation.
they were both sexually assaulted prior to death.
men being raped and murdered on spring break? Well, that's a twist.
so far the deaths have been localized to one hotel.
the Hudson street hotel.
initially, the hotel was filled to capacity but lost 20% occupancy overnight.
we should get a list of everyone who works there.
there's a good chance one of them is the unsub, at the very least has interacted with him.
Yeah, Garcia's already on that.
both victims were discovered by hotel staff, the last after online checkout indicated the room had been vacated.
so he wanted the bodies discovered, and sooner rather than later.
look at the way they're posed--naked, cowering in the fetal position.
he's sending a message.
something about this is important to him.
we just need to figure out what.
and we need to do it soon.
the police suspect the unsub could be another vacationing student,
though I'm not willing to rule out local involvement.
makes sense.
if the killer is a student, they could be halfway across the country by the time we're onto them.
if he's a local, we could lose him as soon as his victim pool dries up.
either way, we're almost out of time.
south padre spring break season ends this weekend.
but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always gotten there first and is waiting for it."
Terry Pratchett.
national media has picked up on the story.
we're gonna have to make a statement when we land.
we want to make people aware without obviously causing panic.
stress hypervigilance, the whole buddy system, yeah, I'm all over it.
I just don't think anyone's gonna listen.
what do you mean?
come on. Drunk college students don't exactly want to hear they shouldn't talk to strangers.
right.
was there any DNA left on the scene?
uh, yeah. Too much DNA.
this portion of the Garcia Show will be brought to you by the letter "i" for icky.
the lab has recovered over 100 different trace samples, as multiple guests create a cesspool of DNA.
also, there is no way to determine the exact time of "secretion" or to eliminate anyone actually working at the hotel.
were you able to find any connection between the first two victims?
no. They grew up in different states.
they went to colleges on opposite coasts. I did the whole cross-reference credit card thing, couldn't make it connect.
so the hotel's the only common denominator. - Yeah.
and it should be noted that the first victim, William Browder, wasn't exactly a registered guest.
well, that's a popular thing to do. I mean, youngsters do it all the time.
they rent a room, they pack in as many kids as possible to save costs.
we could be dealing with hundreds of unregistered guests.
we need to check every guest, whether they were on the books or not.
male raping male.
so are we presuming our unsub or victims could be gay?
that's not necessarily true.
in male rape, sexual preference typically has less to do with the crime than the power and dominance the attacker feels from the act itself.
still, it's a question we should ask the families when we interview them.
it could help us determine how the unsub met the victims.
we got a lot of work to do.
Emily, JJ, and I will go to the local p. d. and start victimology.
the rest of you, there's your new home.
you must be the FBI.
david Rossi. These are agents Morgan and Reid.
Julie Riley. I'm the manager.
you were on duty when the latest body was discovered?
that's right.
did you happen to notice anyone out of the ordinary?
I'm afraid not.
you see so many faces during the spring break, pretty soon they all start to blur.
we need to set up interviews with the rest of your staff as soon as possible, also talk to the hotel guests.
of course.
how many cameras do you have on the property?
not enough.
we have all the main entrances and the garage covered.
but the hallways and the service tunnels aren't equipped.
can you show us the room where the last body was found?
um, I'll start rounding up the rest of the staff for you to talk to.
Thanks.
no signs of struggle reported.
everything seemed normal when housekeeping arrived.
look at this.
scratch marks on the footboard.
the victims were bound before the struggle began.
well, that would make sense. Both victims were in pretty good shape.
probably needed them tied up in order to control them.
the question is, was it consensual or was it coerced?
agent Hotchner. These are agents Prentiss and Jareau.
hello.
well, thanks for being here.
if it's all right with you, we'd like to talk to the victim's friends and family as soon as possible.
of course. Michael Browder, the father of the first victim， has just arrived to claim his son's body.
and the second victim's girlfriend should be here within the hour.
does, uh, Mr. Browder know the details of his son's murder?
not everything.
I mean, there were certain matters I didn't want to bring up on the phone.
if you don't mind, we'd like to handle that ourselves.
we're gonna have to ask him a few difficult questions about his son.
honestly, I have been dreading it all day.
I'll talk to the girlfriend. - Right this way.
so if I'm the unsub and it wasn't consensual, how does this work?
you'd have to have a weapon.
a gun to the face means he doesn't scream out.
look at the distance between where each of the arms were tied.
there's no way he could have tied that second hand himself.
which means the unsub did it for him.
which would be risky, because if he knew he was in danger and he saw the opportunity, he would take it.
then why not drug him and then tie him up? Eliminate the risk.
the tox screen came back negative.
so it's either consensual or he has a partner.
he's also learning fast. - What do you mean?
he hides the body in the closet and then indicates that the guest has checked out.
which means when the housekeeper gets here...everything looks normal. And she starts cleaning, wiping everything down.
erasing any fingerprints or DNA which could have been left on the scene.
we need to talk to whoever cleaned this room.
maybe they saw something that can tell us who was in here with Dan Keller.
Mr. Browder, did your son have any history of drug abuse?
marijuana, methamphetamine, anything?
none. He was an athlete in high school and college. Tested regularly.
did he mention anything about meeting someone here in south padre? Old acquaintances?
he came down with some friends from his school.
they wanted to blow off steam before finals.
Mr. Browder, was your son gay?
he had had sex with a man before he died.
knowing whether or not it was consensual will help us determine how he was targeted.
Adam Jackson? Your manager said we could find you up here.
uh - - I - - I get migraines.
you discovered the body last night? - Yeah.
had you ever seen him before?
or noticed anyone he may have been with?
I've never seen him before in my life.
since I opened the closet, I can't get him out of my head.
Adam, what about the first victim, William Browder?
have you ever seen him before?
never seen either of them.
let me ask you this - - is there anything you remember about the room before you discovered the body?
it might not seem like much, but the smallest detail could really help us a lot.
it looked pretty normal.
I mean, until I opened the closet door.
did anything stand out about the body?
or, uh, for that matter, anyone at the hotel last night?
no, man. You seen one drunk frat guy, you seen 'em all.
Adam, I thought you said you didn't recognize him.
I didn't. I just - - that girl from Corpus Christi across the
they walk around like they own the place, you know?
they think they can do whatever they want.
how long have you worked here?
6 months, I guess.
appreciate your time. - Thank you.
can I ask you a question? - Yeah.
you've seen bad stuff, right?
I have, yeah.
how long before you can close your eyes without it being there?
I'm afraid I still don't know.
morgan and Reid are finishing the interview.
what did you learn?
it doesn't look like either of our victims was gay.
Dan Keller's girlfriend describes him as overtly sexual and aggressive towards women.
it caused quite a few problems in their relationship.
and his friends said they were out partying prior to his death.
and he was definitely willing to overlook the fact that he had a girlfriend.
does that match with what you found at the scene?
yes and no.
what do you mean?
the victims were both big guys, yet there were no signs of a struggle.
we profile it as either being consensual or...
the unsub had a partner.
sounds right. What's your hesitation?
what if it was both? - How so?
well, even if he was confronted by two men, the first reaction of an alpha male would be to fight.
but not if it were a woman. - It's spring break.
she lures the victim to her hotel room, ties him up, then once he's subdued...
her partner arrives.
that could explain the posing and the rape.
the victims are alpha males with aggressive sexual tendencies.
the unsub treats his victims the way they treat women.
so we have a team.
a woman who lures them back to their hotel room and ties them up...
and a man who rapes and murders them.
Thanks, man.
Oh, look at that.
whoa ho, where are you going?
don't worry about it.
your unsubs have changed hotels.
what can you tell us?
the vic's name is Carl Cade, another spring breaker.
any witnesses?
his friends saw him last night leave a party with a brunette in a green dress.
both had been drinking for most of the day,
and he only caught a glimpse of the girl before they left the party.
and he found the body posed just like the others.
it sounds like our theory about the partners was right.
woman lures the victim back, she offers up a little kink, then ties him up.
only this time the unsubs ventured outside of their comfort zone.
they changed hotels.
OK, so what's he doing, getting bolder or smarter?
well, the local police are on alert, the FBI is here.
they probably changed pattern to avoid getting caught.
or because they saw us at the other hotel.
we need to go back to Hudson street.
we believe at least one of our unsubs is either a guest at the Hudson street hotel or possible an employee there.
we have agents in uniforms recanvassing the entire property.
but we all know kids on spring break.
they migrate from place to place.
we can't be sure that the killer's still on site.
which is why we need you to circulate this profile.
we believe we're looking for a dominant/submissive team, a man and a woman probably in their 20s.
we are looking for a heterosexual male who most likely is submissive in his everyday life, with everyone except his partner.
to her he becomes dominant.
his submissive female partner will be socially awkward, of average intelligence, and emotionally unstable.
look for women who are reclusive, have a problem with authority, and can't interact with dominant personalities.
this form of male rape is about power and dominance.
it is not about sexual orientation. So victimology is key.
this team targets alpha personality males who think that women are their right.
add drugs or alcohol to the equation and now we're dealing with eager victims.
even with the mention of rape, an alpha personality fueled by intoxication believes that he can control the situation and eventually gain the upper hand.
we'll need to blanket the beach with fliers, talk to other hotels and bartenders.
we have got 2 days until the spring break season ends, so let's get to work.
Hey, Hotch, I think we got something.
check this-- no report male rape anywhere in the area.
it's not surprising since it's like one of the least reported crimes on the books.
I also looked at video surveillance for the Hudson street hotel on the days of both murders, and zip.
tell me there is a "but" coming.
but, I also looked at the days leading up to both murders,
and, wouldn't you know it, jackpot of jackpots, that would be William Browder, aka victim number one.
I would like to call him jerkface, seemingly making advances at damsel in distress, aka hotel employee Madison Cooke.
see, jerkface grab damsel, see Adam Jackson-- Let's call him white knight--intervene.
see jerkface knock white knight down.
see white knight pause.
see white knight go postal.
didn't the maintenance man find the second victim? - Yeah.
and he told Reid and Morgan that he'd never met either of the first two victims.
so why lie?
Garcia, I need everything you can find on Adam Jackson.
I'm already on that. - Dave, are you still at the scene?
good, we've got a possible.
Where's Adam Jackson?
I don't know. What's going on?
the day before the first murder, you had an altercation with the victim.
it's spring break. It comes with the territory.
Adam stepped in? - Yeah.
he doesn't strike me as the type to stand up to a bully.
the guy was being a jerk. Adam happened to be there.
and you didn't think it was weird that the same kid ended up dead the next night?
it wasn't Adam.
then why hide the fact that he got into a fight with one of the victims?
Julie told us not to.
she was just trying to protect us both.
Where's Adam? - I don't know. Honestly.
he's supposed to be on duty, but he disappears sometimes.
he might be on the roof.
Morgan, check the roof.
Adam Jackson's life reads like a "how to make an unsub" manual.
born in Corpus Christi, biological mother Rosemary Jackson.
in and out of hospitals - - broken arm, broken rib, exhaustion.
the polite way of saying spousal abuse.
exactly. And then she died suddenly when Adam was 5.
father unknown.
Adam was left in the custody of his stepfather, Mark Harrison.
then it became Adam who was in and out of the emergency room.
he was eventually foster-homed in Dallas until he was granted emancipation at the age of 16.
I would bet you if we could see Mike Harrison back then,
he would bear a striking resemblance to our unsubs' victims.
good work, garcia. Keep digging.
come here. Come here.
what's happening?
you're coming with us. - I - - I don't understand. What's going on?
let's go.
he doesn't really look like the dominant partner type, does he?
no.
he's our guy. - What makes you so sure?
it's a classic profile.
he grows up with an abusive stepfather, somehow manages to escape.
suddenly he finds himself back in the exact same area where his abuser lives.
he's surrounded by nothing but a bunch of alpha males that mirror that type of behavior.
he snaps.
did he have a problem with you as an authority figure when you interviewed him?
he backed away as if he was a little skittish.
and reid?
Reid was a little less imposing and he opened up about his life.
Where's julie?
we're trying to find her.
she's gonna go ballistic.
you're in a lot of trouble, adam.
but I think you know that, right?
the only thing that I did wrong was leave work without telling my boss.
I - - I need to talk to julie.
why don't you tell me about the fight you had with the first victim?
I don't remember.
you don't remember?
no.
Adam, i really want to help you out, but you' gonna have to do a lot better than that.
please...
I just need to talk to julie!
I just got off with garcia.
so, adam jackson doesn't just work at the hotel.
he lives there, too. - What have we got?
when adam was kicked out of school for bad grades, drug possession, and petty theft, he started staying at the hotel.
Julie riley pays his bills.
the manager? - Yeah.
she's bailed him out of jail twice in the past 4 years.
she's also the one that told madison to cover up the fact that adam had a fight with the first victim.
what's the connection between julie and adam?
uh, it turns out when julie was in college she volunteered at the foster care facility, adam used to reside in between homes.
she befriended him and became the surrogate for the absent mother.
and now she's his boss. He owes her everything.
Adam's not the dominant, julie is.
Garcia. - Yes, sir.
I need you to track any movement on julie riley.
cell phone, credit card, atm withdrawal.
I need a last known location.
Julie riley used her credit card 15 minutes ago.
I'm tying the address to your gps... Now.
let's go.
believe me, kid, this is your lucky night.
Adam, let's talk about the fight you had with the first victim, william browder.
there's nothing to tell.
he grabbed madison, I tried to stop him.
that guy was pretty big.
so?
Adam, guys like you and I aren't, uh, we aren't exactly the fighting type.
well, madison's a good person. She didn't deserve to be treated that way.
you see, now I'm really confused, because you just told me that you don't remember the fight.
I don't. I mean, I - - I don't, but I - - I do.
you don't, but you do. Can--can you explain to me how that works?
I remember he grabbed at madison, I tried to stop him, the next thing I knew, julie was pulling me out of the pool.
why did you tell your employees to lie to my agents?
Adam has a record.
he found one of the bodies.
I didn't want you to take the easy way out and pin the murders on him.
why do you look out for him?
why did you bail him out of jail, pay his rent and all of his bills?
he's had a rough life.
and do you take advantage of that?
no.
safe to say he'd kill for you?
No! - Then explain it to me.
what exactly is the relationship?
we've been friends since I was just a kid.
are you lovers?
no.
well, then why does she pay for everything you have?
it's not like it's a handout. I mean...
I'm working at the hotel so I can pay her back.
does she pay for the drugs also?
I - - I told you, I get migraines.
so, take prescription.
I thought you were different.
what does that mean?
do you see something in adam's past that reminds you of yourself?
I don't know what you mean.
in 2003, you reported a sexual assault.
and from the look of the file, the police didn't do a very thorough job looking into it.
I don't want to talk about that.
I'm gonna ask you one more time, would adam kill for you?
no.
then prove it.
you know a polygraph is not admissible.
if we catch them in a lie, it could help us get a confession.
and we change interrogators so they can't get into a rhythm with their answers.
state your name.
what color are your eyes?
blue.
where were you the night carl cade was killed?
at work. - At home.
who is the current president of the united states?
barack obama.
did you murder dan keller?
did you murder william browder?
no. - No.
what is 32 minus 19?
would you kill for julie?
you lied about the altercation with william browder.
is there anything else you've lied about?
no. - No.
did you murder dan keller?
what time did you leave work the night william browder was killed?
I - - I don't remember.
have you ever had a sexual relationship with julie riley?
have you lied about anything else? - No.
did you murder carl cade? - He's just a friend.
using the formula y equals mx plus b, what does b represent?
would adam kill for you? - No.
did you murder carl cade? - No.
no. - Did you murder william browder?
no. - Absolutely not.
would you kill for julie? - No.
no. - No.
what are you looking at?
I'm not sure.
well, they both passed. - How is that possible?
not only that, they passed with flying colors.
the only spike I got on adam was a control question regarding geometric equations, but...
honestly, I think I just flustered him.
either way, we got nothing.
well, I think my couch is calling.
sweet dreams.
what about you?
clean the pool, change the a/c filter, fix the heat lamps by tonight. I got it.
Yeah, thanks.
so... Where are we?
honestly? Nowhere.
we just watched our two most viable suspects walk out the door.
if adam isn't our unsub, he has all the makings to become one someday.
tell me the question that he spiked under in the polygraph.
it was a control question to set the baseline.
it was a geometric equation?
Reid, I really think he was just intimidated.
he tried, he got it wrong, but he wasn't supposed to know the answer anyway.
what if he lied?
what if - - what if he knew the answer to the question but intentionally got it wrong?
I - - I don't know.
why would he do that?
because he realized that he wouldn't know that answer.
you're losing me, kid.
Adam, are you in here?
Adam said he wasn't getting any rest.
he takes midday naps because he's always exhausted.
he has a history of blackouts, reclusive behavior,
prolonged repeated abuse suffered at the hands of a dominant male, who transferred abuse from his female spouse to his prepubescent child.
where are you going with this?
what if our unsub couple isn't a couple at all?
dissociative identity disorder.
you think adam's a multiple personality?
well, it fits.
recurrent physical abuse, knowledge he shouldn't have. We've seen this before.
look at this. All right?
the first intervention is timid.
it's apprehensive, right? But then he gets knocked down...
there's a moment of calm, and then his entire body language changes.
I saw this exact same transformation when adam left the station, only it wasn't rage, it was, uh, arrogance. Like the alter ego wanted me to know.
Why? - I don't know. Power, control.
all I know is the person that stared me down over there was not adam.
he's not assertive like that. He doesn't make eye contact.
so you think the stress of the interrogation blurred the line between adam and his alter personality?
I think the unsub surfaced for just a moment.
it knew the answer to the question, realized adam wouldn't, and lied.
so adam and the woman in the green dress are the same person?
we profiled the duo accurately, only the dominant personalities and alter are inside of adam.
and adam has no idea he killed all those people.
you could argue that adam didn't kill those people.
a separate person inside of him did.
I don't even know what we do with this.
we take him into custody, we let the courts decide.
I thought you were heading home.
I found this in your room.
you went in my room? What? - Yeah, I...
you don't remember the fight with william browder. You disappeared before dan keller was killed, and you won't tell me where you've been. - What are you saying?
why do you have this?
it's not mine.
it was hidden in your closet.
Julie, this is crazy! Ju - - ohh!
did - - did a woman get you involved in this?
No!
if you turn her in, then I can help you.
I didn't kill those people!
I want to believe you, adam.
believe me!
I think that we should go to the police together.
No! - I'll be right there with you.
we'll figure this out.
or I'll go by myself.
I said no.
Adam... What's going on?
you shouldn't be up here.
Adam... You're starting to scare me.
my name is amanda.
if you're in some kind of trouble, hon, i can help you.
Adam doesn't need you anymore.
No! No! No!
Reid and morgan, take the roof.
we've got adam's room.
Hotchner! In the back!
OK, guys, let's back up! Back up! Come on.
excuse me. - Move, move!
we've got a woman down at the back of the hotel.
send medics as soon as possible.
Julie, can you hear me?
Adam... - Ok.
look, help is on the way. I need you not to move.
it wasn't... Him... Strange.
Julie, did he say where he was going?
he called himself amanda. - The alter personality.
Reid, you were right. Where would he go?
not he. She. Amanda, she panicked.
she knew we would connect this to her.
OK, ok, so she's feeling the pressure. She obviously knows she's running out of time.
where would she go?
she's gonna go after the man these victims represent.
Garcia, please tell me you know the whereabouts of mark harrison.
the skeezy wife-beating, child-abusing scumbag never left corpus christi.
sending his address to your p. d.
go.
medics!
Amanda. - Stay back.
put the knife down. - Stand back or I'll kill him.
you do not want to do that.
you don't know what he did.
when adam's mother died, his stepfather needed a new outlet for his aggression, didn't he?
he put adam in dresses. He beat him. He touched him.
Adam was too weak to go through all of that alone.
he was just a little boy.
he needed you to protect him.
I could take it.
I was stronger than he was.
he deserves to die.
Amanda. Amanda. That's not for you to decide.
I swear to god, if you put him down and you come with me,
I will get you and adam the help that you guys need.
Adam will be sentenced for what I've done.
no... I can't let that happen.
Amanda. If you kill yourself, you kill adam.
I don't see how that's protecting him.
and you know what I know?
I know that all you want to do in this world is protect adam.
it's all I've ever done.
then why don't you and I help him together.
you can't help him.
I'm the only one.
I know what I have to do.
I will keep him safe forever.
Reid. He's gone.
it's time to go, kid.
Reid. What's eatin' you, man?
we've taken the victim into custody and let the abuser go free.
I don't really - - I don't see that as much of a win.
a lot of lives are gonna be saved now that amanda's off the street. You know that.
Yeah, i just...
I wish I could have noticed the signs in time to save adam.
come on, don't do that to yourself.
none of us could have noticed.
our profile was right.
we just never considered that the team dynamic could be locked inside one person's mind.
I should have.
talk to me. What is this?
tobias hankel drugged and tortured you for 2 days.
he almost killed you.
no, he didn't.
the alter persona of his father did those things to me.
the real tobias hankel saved my life.
he brought me back from the dead.
and you think because of tobias, somehow you owe adam?
I just - - i know that he's still locked in there somewhere.
kid.
you're gonna have to accept the fact that sometimes we can't save everyone.
tell me, dr. Reid, how long will you keep visiting me in here?
until I find adam.
why do you care?
he deserves a life. It's his.
so you're trying to... Wear me down and release him?
no. I'm just waiting for you to do the right thing.
well, I'm afraid you'll be waiting for a very long time.
stephen king wrote, "monsters are real, and ghosts are real, too.
they live inside us.
and sometimes they win."
well, are you gonna tell him or not?
if you think you can live with this on your conscience.
that's not how it works, sweetie.
Yeah, you can put it out of your head.
it'll just go to your heart.
well, then it'll go somewhere else.
I don't know. Your liver, your pancreas.
why do you think so many people get cancer?
that's how it works. That's what guilt does.
it makes people sick.
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.
well, I'm sorry that it came off that way, but you can understand my position.
I'm friends with both of you.
no, of course I'm not gonna tell him, Janet.
I love you, but I'm sorry, a couple of glasses of wine does not justify -- 3 -- whatever.
Hey, I'm coming to a bad spot on 7. I might lose you.
Hello? Janet?
great.
hey there!
Penelope is hoping the migraine she woke up with this morning goes away in time for the small wonder marathon tonight.
you decent? - Never.
look at you. Did somebody die?
no. - B. A. U. Yearbook photo?
no, I have a job interview.
Hey, rock star, you up for that systems promotion?
no, no. A friend of mine is a headhunter for the NSA.
uh, they're looking for analysts versed in cyber warfare.
Really? That sounds exciting.
Oh, it is. Yeah, the job is totally cutting edge.
Yeah, it sounds like it.
are you sure you're gonna want to make the commute to Fort Meade every day?
actually, it's a -- it's an overseas position.
where overseas?
I can't say. It's classified.
are we breaking up right now?
uh, no. No. Uh -- uh -- they haven't hired me yet.
it--it's my final interview.
final?
how long have you known about this?
a few weeks. I didn't want to say anything to you until it was real.
OK. Ok.
and... And this is what you want?
I'm not sure.
I mean, the long-distance thing would be rough.
Yeah, it would be, considering you can't even tell me where you're going.
well, I -- I could if you applied with me.
I mean, they need other people.
leave the B. A.U?
just think about it?
my head hurts, and JJ just brought in a case.
I need to get back to work.
an unsub that kills with his car.
I haven't seen that before.
neither have the police in bend, Oregon.
which is why they need our help.
two victims in the last 12 days.
first was hit while on a morning jog -- Maria Delgado, 23.
the second was a stranded motorist, Shannon Makely, 43.
and what makes the locals think that they were connected?
well, for one thing, they were both backed over after the initial impact.
no accident there.
they matched treads at both scenes.
large wheels, all-terrain.
wounds also indicate a raised bumper, so they're thinking large SUV or truck.
do they know the model or make?
uh, tires aren't factory issue.
they could be on a number of different models.
no witnesses to either incident?
a hit-and-run is loud, draws attention.
somebody usually sees something.
both victims were attacked in secluded areas.
2 tons of metal make a hell of a weapon.
serial killers have been known to become rather attached to their vehicles.
Bittaker and Norris even have theirs a nickname.
murder Mac.
Bittaker and Norris were sexual sadists. There's no sign of torture here.
it sounds like thrill kills.
opportunistic.
easy targets randomly selected.
with this type of impact, the vehicle shouldn't be hard to pick out of a lineup.
Yeah, there should be significant front-end damage.
somehow I don't think it's gonna be that easy.
with all their speed forward, they may be a step backward in civilization.
booth Tarkington.
well, I think it's safe to assume our unsub is male.
I agree with you, given what we know about aggressive driving and road rage.
and the fact that men have an unnatural bond with their cars.
that is true. -- Wait a minute. I don't know about unnatural.
I once dated a guy who washed his car more than he washed his hair.
a nice car needs love.
and a woman doesn't?
I'm not qualified to answer that.
I'm just saying, big car -- it's phallic.
so he's compensating? -- Or overcompensating.
impotent? -- Possibly.
if the unsub sees himself as physically defective, the car not only gives him the power and control he otherwise lacks, but it also serves as a shield.
a way to avoid physical contact?
power and control, female victims -- that almost reads like a rape profile.
vehicular rape.
rape and thrill kill are two very different profiles.
what does the victimology tell us?
nothing yet. Shannon Makely was a white, married, 43-year-old commities trader,
Maria Delgado was a 23-year-old Hispanic grad student, competitive tri-athlete.
so far, gender's our only link.
hopefully the crime scenes will tell us more.
she lived a little outside of town, was on her way home from work when she broke down.
so she breaks down way back there and she gets out and starts walking.
why not call for help?
no service.
he made a complete stop here, then hit the gas.
full stop in the middle of the road?
take it there's not a lot of traffic out here.
not on this stretch. Not at that time of day, at least.
done working by 3: 00 in the afternoon.
broker. Specialized in foreign markets.
time difference made for some odd hours.
what are you thinking about, Rossi?
what are the odds she breaks down right here?
no phone, no traffic, no witnesses, nowhere to run.
perfect place for an ambush.
not a very popular jogging area.
aren't too many people who can take that hill coming up here.
well, she was a tri-athlete.
we figured she jogged in off the main road, heading for the trail up here.
assailant drove in behind her and ran her down right here.
a woman jogging alone?
no, she would have known if someone was tailing her.
so maybe he was already here.
what's the story with all this equipment?
construction stalled out months ago.
no reason for anyone to be up here.
nice and private.
it's the ideal spot to run somebody down without being seen.
a little convenient.
too convenient.
what if it was her? What if she were the reason he was up here?
you don't think this was a random attack.
oil.
he was lying in wait.
he may have specifically targeted these women.
that takes thrill kill off the table.
because the murders were planned in advance?
Yeah. This type of stalking behavior indicates a personal motive.
bend
there's a reason he chose these victims.
so you think he knows them?
well, he knew their work schedules, jogging routes, drive patterns.
that would explain how he knew where to strike.
it explains the Delgado girl. She was on a run.
but he couldn't have known shannon makely's car was gonna break down out there.
did you look at her car?
guys at impound said the water pump blew.
they said it's a common enough problem.
maybe we should take a closer look.
why don't you head over there, let me know what you find out.
shannon Makely's husband is here.
I just want it to make sense.
but this, I...
we may be able to make some sense out of it with your help.
do you recognize that woman?
no. Should I?
she was the first victim.
we're trying to determine if she was connected to your wife in some way.
connected?
we believe he may have been following them, gathering some sort of information.
did Shannon ever mention noticing anyone?
no.
did you ever notice anyone out of the ordinary in your neighborhood,
maybe someone who was walking or driving by the house repeatedly?
no.
what about a truck or a large SUV?
thursday, I was expecting a package.
I kept checking the street.
there was a truck parked a couple of houses down. I didn't recognize it.
could you see anyone inside?
I couldn't tell. The windows were blacked out.
tinted?
Yeah, only all the way around, like you see with limousines.
do you think that you would recognize the truck if you saw it again?
maybe.
FBI
how's it coming, Gil?
it's coming. These roof sections are brutal.
Yeah. Maybe you want to take an early day.
don't I wish. -- Look, I can smell the booze, man.
I can tell Bert you went home sick.
but -- -- I can handle it.
you're sliding, man. Mistakes, missed deadlines.
is everything ok?
we figured it was the water pump because it was pretty much melted.
but we didn't figure on this.
car's pretty new. That wouldn't be normal wear and tear, would it?
no. Rest of the line's in good condition.
someone punctured it.
you can tell from the smooth edge.
how did they do it?
probably reached a blade right through the grille.
penknife. Something like that.
they wouldn't have even had to pop the hood.
and if she drove away without water in the radiator, it explains the overheating.
it explains the pump, too.
could somebody possibly gauge how far she could have traveled with the car in this condition?
someone who knows cars could make an educated guess, sure.
thank you. Appreciate it.
sabotage.
he's more focused than we thought.
well organized, highly motivated.
by what, though? What do these women have in common?
different ages, appearance, social class.
he's not hunting a specific type.
their only connection is the unsub.
there has to have been contact before the attacks.
but we profiled a guy who's afraid of contact.
the truck's a shield.
maybe the contact's incidental.
there's something he perceives in their exchange.
something about his perception triggers his fixation.
could be the way she looks at him, something she says, or even something as trivial as what she's wearing.
whatever it is, the victims have no idea what they set in motion.
these are all Ford models.
the grilles are kind of like you described.
Yeah, I guess.
it didn't have that emblem, though.
and no hood ornament. Nothing like that.
I understand this is hard, but this really will help us.
I'll keep looking.
how's it going?
well, we're down to an older model, black, american made.
sounds like he debadged the truck so nobody could I. D.him.
I can start a list from DMV matching what we've got.
a list like that's gonna kill a lot of trees.
he's right. The truck's only gonna get us so far.
what we need to do is build on the profile.
well, he's mechanically inclined.
he certainly knows his away around an engine block.
and he can pull a dent, too, if he's fixing the body damage to his truck.
both victims were killed during pri office hours.
it means he has a flexible work schedule.
or he might not be working at all.
stalking someone, getting to know their schedule, it's a pretty serious time commitment.
8% of the state's out of work.
and job loss is a classic stressor.
it's a start. Look for men who are employed as mechanics, body shops,
and look for those with criminal records -- reckless driving and assault.
two murders in two weeks?
it's not much of a cooling-off period.
he's not gonna wait for another opportunity to present itself.
now he'll create one.
son of a
great.
help me!
hold the elevator!
hold it!
impact nearly cut him in two.
his name is Victor Costella, podiatrist.
he works in the building. -- Male victim.
so much for the vehicular rape theory.
he ran down from the level above to try to get away.
initial collision was up there?
let's see it.
this is the victim's car? -- Yeah. Why?
uh, excuse me for a second.
Garcia, I need you to look into something.
it's a reserved spot.
unsub knew where he was gonna park, must have gotten here early and picked this spot right across.
somebody might have seen him waiting. -- Somebody did.
talked to an x-ray tech on the third floor.
noticed a truck when she arrived.
and he was inside it?
Yeah, but she couldn't see him because of the tint.
so how did she know he was inside the truck?
she said the window was cracked. Occupant was smoking.
I don't suppose your people found any cigarette butts.
what time did the, uh, tech get in?
10 a. m.
7 hours.
proper addict could kill a whole pack.
did you ever smoke?
I used to do a lot of things.
bet you never did this.
he field-stripped it. -- What is that?
something they teach soldiers to avoid leaving traces in the field.
they squeeze out the filter, then ball up the surrounding paper.
OK, so our guy could be ex-military.
we can get DNA on this. Maybe we'll get lucky, he's in the system.
if he's military, why would he choose a truck as his weapon?
maybe he drove a tank.
that's a good question, using a vehicle on the open road is one thing, but...
this is close quarters. -- Yeah.
a truck is loud, it draws attention.
plus he risked rendering it inoperable.
doesn't make any sense. -- It does to him.
he needs to kill this way. I just don't know why.
guys, I think I know what connects the victims.
all of the victims drove red 2-door coupes.
don't you think that could be a coincidence?
it's statistically significant.
we haven't been able to find any other common denominators.
if the unsub is targeting people because of their cars,
then his initial contact with them would have been on the road.
exactly.
I spoke to the families about the victims' daily car travel, how they got to work, the gym.
there's one road all the victims have in common.
route 7.
that mean something to you?
maybe we should take a drive.
anyone living outside Bend who commutes toward Eugene uses Route 7.
it's the most dangerous stretch of highway in the state.
they call it "Suicide 7."
these crosses represent accidents?
fatalities. The fire chief put them up to remind drivers to be careful.
2 lanes, no dividers.
I'm assuming there's a lot of head-on collisions.
either that or they go off the side.
Reid, you mentioned the possibility of a physical limitation,
something that kept the unsub from attacking in the traditional way.
Yeah, I was thinking about impotence, but we've ruled out sexual motivation.
what if he'd been involved in a crash?
on this road.
if the unsub is disabled, it explains why he uses a truck.
it gives him power, mobility.
but what?
the idea that he's avenging his own physical suffering speaks to a victim mentality that's inconsient with the profile.
maybe it's not just about his own suffering.
wake up, honey.
help me!
as we speak, this profile and a description of the unsub's truck are being released to state and national media.
in addition to what we already know,
we believe the unsub is ex-military, most likely army or marines.
we also believe he's physically handicapped.
from combat? -- From an automobile accident.
an accident that may have occurred along Route 7, where the unsub finds his victims.
and that has something to do with why he's going after red coupes?
we believe that he holds the driver of a comparable vehicle responsible for his accident.
and this person is the object of his rage, but unable to confront them,
he's taking revenge against a surrogate.
these boxes contain accident reports from a strip of Route 7 between bBend and Eugene.
there's about 5 years' worth.
we're gonna need everyone you can spare to comb through them.
we've also compiled a list of local rehabilitation facilities where the unsub may have gone to recover.
use the profile as you canvass these places.
remember, we're looking for a white male in his early 40s, former military...
who may have sustained serious injury in a car accident.
though only owners of red coupes have been targeted at this point,
we're asking all the driving public to be vigilant on the road.
and if you know anyone who fits this description,
please contact the Bend police department immediately. Thank you.
Gil? I could use some help in here.
I've got bare feet here. Could you maybe sweep up the glass?
I think I have to go.
what? -- I'm sorry.
where are you going?
damn it! Gil, wait!
what's happening to you?
how's Dave doing?
a few more possibles.
I'll take them.
Hotch. Just got a walk-in. His name's Gil Bonner.
what's his story?
it's about the unsub's accident. He says it's his fault.
it was late, and I'd spent all day in Eugene with my mom.
she'd been sick.
I shouldn't have been driving.
but I just wanted to get home to see my little girl.
it was darker than usual.
I remember the moon was just a sliver.
right outside the Cascades, my phone started vibrating.
and when I went to reach for it, I knocked it off the far side of the seat,
and it fell down by the door, and I thought I could reach.
and you took your eyes off the road?
if couldn't have been for more than a few seconds.
but when I looked back up, there were lights and this horn was blaring.
and I swerved at the last second, and then just...
kept on going... Without a scratch.
you'd gone into the oncoming lane?
what happened to the other vehicle?
well, that's the thing. It was in rearview mirror and then it was gone.
it vanished.
why didn't you stop?
it didn't seem real.
you're saying you just pretended it didn't happen?
I guess if you tell yourself something for long enough...
you can make anything true.
well, you're here now. Tell us about thother vehicle.
it was the truck you're looking for.
how do you know that?
when I saw the news...
it all made sense.
it's come back for revenge.
when did the accident occur?
december '07. The second saturday.
there are no accidents reported in December of 2007.
no. That's... No.
maybe you have your dates wrong?
it could have been November.
uh, memories are kind of like puzzle pieces, and it's
it's quite possible that in suppressing these for so long, you've sort of rearranged things.
how long was your mother sick?
5 months. She...
she died in January.
that much I know.
he's ex-military, good with his hands, repairs. -- Ok, thanks.
look, even with that description, you're talking about 5 years' worth of patients.
what if we could narrow it down to a 5-month window, between September '07 and January '08?
what's this person done, exactly?
exactly? 3 murders.
and he's not gonna stop there.
murders? You do realize the condition of our patients?
a paraplegic can drive with the right rigging.
is this about those hit-and-runs?
there's something you should see.
he, uh, he left us about... 4 months ago.
didn't make the kind of progress that we'd hoped for.
getting himself back in shape?
no, physically, he -- he made great strides.
it was emotional issues.
anger issues?
did he ever talk about getting even?
you can look for yourself.
we have the patients write and draw daily.
small tasks to help strengthen their hands.
Ian spent most of his time on those.
you had to know this guy was disturbed.
it's part of healing. We encourage this kind of
murder fantasy.
grief can take on disturbing forms.
red car.
they're all different, like he couldn't decide.
when his memory came back, it was... fluid.
so it changed, like his targets.
his mind was trying to find out the truth about what had happened.
we need the date of his accident.
september 28, 2007, Ian and Sheila Coakley crashed
while driving home from Napa Valley going eastbound on Route 7 around midnight.
it appeared their car was run off the road, flipped numerous times, no witnesses.
his wife was riding in the passenger seat. She died at the scene.
Coakley survived. Paramedics indicated spinal cord injury.
morgan said he fractured his T6 and T7 vertebrae.
he's paraplegic.
that's not all. He's a former light-wheel mechanic in the army national guard.
does it say anything about a red car?
no. It says Coakley suffered memory loss after the accident.
short-term retrograde amnesia is common after a serious accident.
I think it's safe to say he remembers now.
do we have an address? - Yeah, Garcia's working on that now.
OK. The house Coakley and his wife bought was foreclosed on 10 months after his accident.
well, there's gotta be a paper trail, then.
Yeah, and that trail leads to a land called nowhere.
cashed some insurance checks during a stay at Edelman House, but after he left, zilch.
any relatives he could be staying with?
no. I tried that. There's no family in the area.
my exquisitely educated guess is he's either squatting or subletting with cash.
what about his truck?
he owns a '79 dodge D100.
he bought it used 10 years ago.
he's had to rebuild it several times now.
parts can't be easy to find for a truck that old.
I smell what you're cooking, agent.
checking auto suppliers in Bend.
Yeah, Rossi gets a fruit cup with lunch.
he's having the parts drop-shipped through Syd's auto
and sent directly to an address in southwest Bend.
clear!
it's clear.
his truck is gone.
we're all clear here.
get all your vehicles off this street, set up a perimeter.
if Coakley comes back this way, we want to be ready for him.
got it. Come on.
let's get to work. -- Rossi. Come on. You want to see this.
look at the grilles.
they still got blood on them.
he's been switching plates.
we should revise the bolo.
Hey, Rossi, look at this.
stalk central.
that right there's Shannon Makely.
Maria Delgado jogging.
Victor Costella. They're all here.
so who's this guy?
you think it's possible there are other victims we don't know about?
I don't think so. Garcia would have found them.
then I think we've found his next target.
Hey, baby girl. I need you to run a plate fast.
Hey, Garret. -- That's good.
Mrs. Burke? FBI. We're looking for your husband.
sorry, you just missed him.
what is this about?
we think he may be in danger.
can you reach him on his cell?
no. He's on a ride. He doesn't take his phone with him.
a bike ride? Yes. He's in a club.
he's on the open road.
do they have a regular route?
um, Saturdays-- uh, they do the Prineville reservoir loop.
it's about a 50-mile round trip from here.
please... What is going on?
we need you to tell us every road they take.
Hey, I thought you could use a hand.
Oh, thank you. Have you heard anything from Hotch?
home
uh, they think they've located Garret Burke.
if they can bring him in, Coakley has nowhere to go.
well, he'll go somewhere.
hopefully, going through this stuff will help us figure out where.
all of his wife's things.
he never unpacked them.
he never unpacked anything, as far as I can tell.
what do you think this means, living like this?
I think it means he's stuck.
Hotch, we're on Route 26 heading toward the reservoir.
I think we're about halfway around the loop.
so far no sign of him.
copy that. We're heading southbound on 20.
hopefully we can hit Route 26 before they fly by us.
anything? -- 9/26/07.
that was was 2 days before the crash?
they were really happy.
wait a second.
Hotch, you know how Coakley was driving his wife's car on the night of the accident?
it was a red coupe.
are you sure? -- We have pictures.
what does it mean?
maybe there was no other car. -- What?
think about it. The make and model of his target car keeps changing.
like he knows they aren't right.
and his doctor at the rehab facility called if fluid memory,
but what if it was more than that?
so if it's a single-car accident...
it was Coakley's fault.
he was driving back from Napa Valley that night. That's a long drive.
fell asleep at the wheel.
wouldn't be the first time.
the guilt of that would be overwhelming, the truth almost impossible to take.
so he's projecting blame.
a red coupe did cause the accident, and he was driving it.
hold on!
are you hurt?
can you move? -- I'm ok. Go.
you can't blame other people for what you've done, Coakley.
detective! Detective!
you know the truth.
no one else needs to die.
it's not gonna help!
there was no other red car, was there?
no. No.
go! Go!
where the hell is he going, Rossi?
there's no outlet up here. He's hemmed in.
no, don't do it, man.
I don't know about you, but I haven't had my bell rung like that in a long time.
no, I'm good, thanks.
impressive group you travel with.
they are.
you knew what I said to Coakley was gonna set him off.
challenging a delusion like his can have unpredictable consequences.
like driving off a cliff.
he made a choice.
well, I'm not gonna lose any sleep over it if it's ok with you.
uh, I'll catch up with you. -- Ok.
Mr. Bonner.
I got a message that you wanted to see me.
Yes. Thanks for coming in. I did so fact-checking.
you said the moon was just a sliver that night.
the new moon was on November 10, 2007.
what else did you find?
a man named William Madlock was run off the road that night by a car that drifted into his lane.
no injuries?
there was some damage to his car.
and you'll be held responsible for fleeing the scene.
a volkswagen? But it was a truck.
was it?
I think you've wanted to tell someone about this for a very long time.
and this case, that truck, gave you the excuse you needed.
guilt's a powerfulhing.
you didn't hurt anyone, Mr. Bonner.
thank you.
Garcia is...
contemplating a life of solitude and celibacy.
did you get the job? -- No.
I'm sorry.
only a...
fool would hire somebody over you for that job.
Oh, no, they didn't hire anybody. The position just...
went away. -- Went away?
Yeah. Apparently there was a security breach.
someone hacked the project database, and the whole project was put on hold.
all that over a little network hack.
well, you know, you can't be too careful. You know how that goes.
right. Well...
it's probably blessing in disguise.
I mean... With your delicate stomach, you wouldn't have been able to stand the food in Karachi.
I never told you that it was in Karachi.
didn't you?
OK. It's ok. I could not have gone without you.
and I couldn't have gone with you.
this place is my home. -- I know.
the human voice can never reach the distance that is covered by the still, small voice of conscience.
mahatma Gandhi.
come on, daddy!
let's go home!
drew. Drew, just-- just stop.
I get it. That's why allison is with you.
Oh, god. I am dealing with it.
well, you took her from me, remember?
Ben, i thought you paid the bill.
what are you doing?
any closer and the image will distort.
how is jack?
he's real smart. Had us in tears. Great kid.
Haley?
to be honest, we're moving them to a halfway house.
I thought you had found a permanent location.
Haley made a number of phone calls to her mother.
it's all good, but to be safe, we have to move them.
Sam, thank you.
I promise you, no harm will come to them.
you just concentrate on getting foyet.
happy birthday, buddy.
you got a second?
sure, what is it?
a case just came in.
I'll be right there.
actually, I need to talk to you.
it's on commack, long island. - That's your home town.
Yeah. And if it's ok, i'd rather stay behind.
Why?
it was a different life, one I left 30 years ago.
I'm in no hurry to go back. - Well...
any other day, i'd say stay, but I just became aware of this.
what have we got?
Ben vanderwaal was killed in commack, long island, last night, shot at close range, once in the heart, once in the head, . 22 caliber shell.
they found hair and blood traces from ben vanderwaal's wife heather.
but not heather?
no, she's still missing, presumed dead.
the caliber and placement of the bullets match that of two previous victims.
the first, rita haslat.
8 months ago she went missing from her home in new jersey.
4 weeks later, she was found in a trash bin.
she went from that to this in under 3 weeks?
she's totally emaciated.
ligature marks on her wrists and ankles indicate she was constrained.
one in the heart, one in the head-- same as vanderwaal.
sounds more like an execution.
then why cut off vanderwaal's hands postmortem?
what about the third victim?
bill levington. His appearance was certainly altered.
his genitals were missing.
though the method of mutilation is different in each crime, clearly there's a signature.
the question is, what?
wheels-up in 20 minutes. - What's this?
you told me you were cleared to travel. You lied.
naughty boy. - Uh, no, i didn't.
I am a doctor, so technically, I wasn't a lie.
what was it, then?
second opinion.
you're my bitch now.
force without justice is tyrannical.
blaise pascal.
in the ben vanderwaal case, his hands were taken.
uh, bill levington, his genitals.
only in the rita haslat case she was starved and tortured, then executed, and there's no sign of postmortem mutilation.
why would he take heather vanderwaal and not simply kill her?
maybe he hasn't and she's still alive.
the only thing concrete is the m. O. which depicts an efficient no-nonsense murderer.
well, then we need to figure out what each act of mutilation means to the unsub.
or to the victim.
it's pretty much how we found it. There's no signs of forced entry.
it says in the file that heather vanderwaal has a daughter. Where is she?
she moved to san diego to live with her real father.
Ben and heather vanderwaal have only been married a couple of years.
so heather came in, she dropped her shopping bags, her cell phone, and her keys, but not her coat.
she turns on the lights.
but they didn't work, because the phone and the electricity were cut.
something in this room attracted her attention.
what is it?
marks in the blood look like a camera tripod.
serial killers, especially sexual sadists, often document their kill.
but sexual sadists usually torture their victims while they're still alive.
you still didn't find any conflicting dna?
no. No prints, no fibers, nothing.
nobody heard any shots? - No.
Oh, excuse me.
yeah? All right.
Heather vanderwaal was just found wandering the streets half hour ago.
she's at brookside general.
get jj over there.
a killer this sophisticated doesn't leave a living witness without a reason.
Heather, my name is agent jareau.
I have some questions for you.
so you came home, you tried to turn the lights on, but they didn't work.
what did you do next?
I saw a light. A flash.
I opened the door, and ben was there, tied to a chair.
I think he was dead.
there was another flash.
it blinded me for a moment.
did you see your attacker? - No.
did he say anything? - No.
I heard this noise.
what kind of noise?
sawing.
I watched him cut off ben's hand.
why didn't he kill me?
excuse me.
we've been getting to know heather vanderwaal.
I can't tell you her favorite beatle, but I can tell you she was living la vida unhappy.
what did you find?
her ex-husband took her daughter allison out of school mid-term.
after that, heather cut a check for $5, 000 to a place called lewis, bell,& peters 6 days ago.
law firm? - Family law.
Thanks.
Mrs. Vanderwaal...
at mid-term you moved your daughter out of school?
Yes, i did.
after that, you filed for divorce from ben.
this man left you alive for a reason.
I need to know if these two things are connected.
a few months ago, I found a picture of allison on ben's phone.
your daughter.
she was naked.
where was it taken? - I couldn't tell.
did you confront him? - Yes.
he claimed that allison sent it to him by mistake.
she meant to send it to another student at her school.
it's called sexting.
what did allison say?
she said ben took it, but she--she lies.
Allison, she's a liar.
she caused us a lot of trouble, you know?
she wasn't lying about this, though, was she?
no.
the hand removal is less than surgical.
he used a basic double-toothed saw.
so, the guy we're looking for has no medical training.
not the kind i've had.
one in the heart, one in the brain, close range.
the second one was right up behind the ear.
how about gunshot residue?
surprisingly little.
maybe it's because the killer was using a . 22
small caliber, small discharge.
what is it?
ballistics can't match the bullets to a gun.
there were no rifling marks on the bullet.
there's only one explanation for that.
well, if anyone had a motive to kill ben vanderwaal, it was heather's ex-husband.
but he was in san diego, and he has no connection to the other two victims.
david rossi, we finally get to meet.
detective gil hardesty. Very, very nice to have you with us.
Morgan, what did you find?
in all cases, the . 22 caliber bullets had no rifling marks.
and without the barrel being rifled, the bullets would have very little velocity.
he would have to shoot his victim pointblank. - Jj.
this guy's using a zip gun. Now, if you know what you're doing, a piece of plumbing or a kid's bicycle pump can be turned into a gun.
one in the heart, one in the head.
untraceable, expandable bullets tell me without question, - all of these kills were strictly business. - A hitman?
what about the postmortem mutilation?
a contract sometimes includes extras.
the camera is not for sexual gratification, it's for proof of death.
so we could be looking for two people?
maybe. Maybe more. - Excuse me.
I may be able to hit on some old contacts, but i'll need to do it alone.
contacts? - Do we want to know?
best not.
we don't open till 5: 30.
I'm looking for the owner of that coat.
is that right?
not with that you're not.
check out the front and back.
you're either a dead man or a cop. Which one is it?
right now i'm just an old friend.
you gave up that right the day you became a fed.
I thought you retired. Writing books?
what can I tell you, ray?
some habits are hard to break.
I try this damn puzzle every morning.
never gets any easier.
crater creator.
you know, I work with a kid who can solve this whole thing in 5 minutes.
he must be smarter than both of us.
that's for sure.
so what's it been, 30 years? - 33.
you know, i thought at the very least I would see you at emma's funeral.
I, um... Need to ask you a favor.
she loved you as much as you loved her.
Hey, ambition's a bitch, ain't it?
I'm not here to talk about emma.
what are you here to talk about?
you've read the news? - You think I got something to do with that?
you should stick to writing books.
this guy is real specific.
he uses a zip gun and then throws in extras.
for a smart guy, your coming back here was a real dumb move.
not as dumb as the one that sean made.
he's on trial for the transportation of weapons, no doubt for you.
and what about the rico beef hanging over your head?
you help me, and you'll be assisting a federal investigation.
and what exactly is that gonna do for my reputation?
if you don't, you may not have one to protect.
our organized crime unit is very close to shutting you down permanently.
keep talking.
the removal of the hands is as specific as rita haslat's condition was when she was found.
just as specific as the removal of bill levington's genitals.
there's a message in the mutilations the unsub wants us to know.
I got something here that might help us with
technically, we have something here that might help with that.
bill levington was involved in a serial rape case, all involving minors, and it never went to trial.
Rita haslat?
a former social worker, attained said former status when she was fired from the dcfs for gross negligence.
in one of her cases, a 7-year-old boy starved to death.
which explains why haslat was so emaciated when she was found.
if all the victims were indicated in crimes against children, then we've found a connection.
one of the unsubs has access to the crimes of the victims and probably works in the justice system.
Garcia? - On it.
all right, well, we know what the victims have in common, we just need to find out who they have in common.
wait. This social worker and the suspected rape case, those were matters of record.
Ben vanderwaal's relationship with his stepdaughter is not.
unless the stepdaughter told someone else.
I'll call rossi.
I'll have the daughter brought in.
and all 3 crimes were against children?
OK. Thanks, prentiss.
Cuban, no doubt.
contraband?
some laws are just plain unjust.
you know, those 3 individuals messed with kids.
they got what they deserve.
that all depends on your definition of justice.
it's the same as when we were kids.
you do what you gotta do to survive.
what about this guy?
Yeah. There's only one guy that's this specific.
name?
I spoke to heather last night.
I knew for a long time something was off, but this-- why didn't you tell me?
Mr. Sandweiss, allison is the victim here.
I just want to know the truth from her, for once.
I told you, I don't know what they're talking about.
Allison, we have the pictures your stepfather took of you.
he was always home before mom.
we just talked at first.
why didn't you tell your mom?
I knew she'd tell dad, and he always said he'd kill anyone who laid a hand on me.
and did he?
how long has he been operating?
20 years. He's a ghost.
I've heard that name. Bosola.
he's a character in a play.
Jacobean tragedy called the duchess of malfi.
bosola brutally slays the duchess.
it wouldn't be a tragedy if he didn't.
is he local?
I don't care about the rico beef.
what about sean?
federal prison, out in 2.
all right.
I'll bring you bosola tonight.
you better bring the marine corps.
Allison, did you ever tell anyone about what your stepfather was doing?
I told my therapist.
he said I act out because I crave attention.
I'm so sorry, daddy.
you have nothing to be sorry for.
we need his name, please. Your therapist.
am I a suspect?
not yet, mr. Sorum.
what is your professional opinion of allison?
you mean was she sexually abused by her stepfather? No question.
and you reported it. - Of course.
to the police? - Absolutely.
how far did they take it?
they had it reviewed by the state.
did the police interview her?
they came to my office. Allison wanted nothing to do with it. Case closed.
just like the 380, 000 cases of child abuse reported in this country each year.
less than one percent gets to trial.
does that make you want to even the odds?
every time I listen to a child vividly recount the most horrific acts of abuse done at the hands of a father, an uncle, someone they're supposed to trust...
it's all I can do not to break down.
but that's all i'm capable of.
after that, like you, I trust in the justice system.
Rossi. - Midnight. My restaurant.
most people never meet bosola.
those that do only ever meet him once.
if he smells a fed, i'm gonna end up like the duchess.
now, that would be a tragedy.
I've never said anything out of turn, ever, have i?
go on.
always you've treated me like a son.
I'm closing the restaurant tonight.
you and the boys take the night off.
I can't let you do this alone.
I'm not helping the feds.
I'm helping an old friend.
good night. Go on.
he dims the lights, we go in.
so, uh, jack's what, 4 today? - Yeah.
and I literally have no idea where he is.
he's safe.
I saw prentiss and morgan up the block, but the two agents in the sedan, they're not with us.
that the counter surveillance in case foyet is watching me.
for which, apparently, there's no more money.
Yeah, i heard.
did somebody call you?
they're concerned. - What did you say?
what i'm telling you. An attack against you is an attack against all of us.
why are you calling? You ok?
I hope you got some good guys out there.
this man is a mean son of a bitch.
we're all over. He's not gonna know what hit him.
Hey, that kid-- the, uh, smart one-- I could use a little help.
Reid? - Reid here.
crossword question. 10 letters. Crater creator.
10 letters, crater creator.
arctangent.
did you get that? - Damn, she's smart.
did you see that-- flash?
I saw that. - He's already in there.
all units, go, go, go!
Morgan's out canvassing the area.
this whole place is swarming with cops.
we had the streets, the building, even the damn roof covered.
how the hell did he get through us?
Garcia traced finnegan's phone calls.
he made one at 4: 38 to a pre-paid cell, another one to you at 11: 41.
we gave bosola 7 hours to prepare.
I think he was here before we arrived.
and he heard ray call me. This is all my fault.
now he knows we're onto him. - He's not the only one.
whoever he works for does, too.
each mutilation represents the crimes the unsubs believe these 3 individuals committed.
unsubs? - Unknown subjects.
2. Both male. Unsub "a" we're calling the planner.
he works in the criminal justice system.
we're looking at both defense and prosecution attorneys, judges, and even cops.
we believe that the planner has experienced a devastating personal tragedy of some sort.
and because of the sophisticated nature of the scenario, we believe unsub "a" is in his late 50s or 60s.
the planner likely met unsub "b," the enforcer, within the court system.
he's been hired to carry out justice.
now, this type of justice does not come cheap.
so the planner has access to substantial cash.
absolutely no attempt was made to hide the mutilation.
this suggests the planner either doesn't care what we find or he wants us to find it.
now, the enforcer, on the other hand, has no such intentions.
he should be considered armed and extremely dangerous.
thank you. - All right. Let's go, people.
all final payments have been made.
I see no reason not to complete the tasks or to converse further.
good. One last request
I would like you to pay special attention to mr. Patton.
I've concentrated on the last 3 cases.
they've left the freshest e-prints. - Great.
not really. Over 100, 000 cases pass through long island court.
who had eyes on those files?
literally hundreds and hundreds of people.
change track. Focus on the enforcer.
Mob-related murder trials on long island the last 10 years.
we're looking for a hitman.
Hey, there are 93 mob trials in the last 10 years.
put aside any trials that resulted in a conviction.
weed out mistrials and arraignments.
uh, 19.
were any of those on trial suspected of being hitmen or enforcers?
3-- - whoa, whoa, whoa, this totally slipped the net.
Tony mecacci--his case was judged a mistrial, but check out his suspected victim.
.22 caliber, right? - Bull's-eye.
cross-match our profile of the planner against all those connected with this trial.
let's see--prosecuting lawyer garrett daniels, judge boyd schuller, criminal defense lawyer paul
wait, wait. Did you say judge schuller?
Yeah, here's a photo. - What's wrong?
do you know him? - No. But I knew his wife.
2 years ago she was driving home from work and she was killed by a drunk driver.
that could be the tragedy.
she was the love of his life, that's for sure.
12 months ago, judge schuller took a leave of absence due to health issues.
he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He has 6 months to live.
and that's when the killing started.
you don't seriously think judge-- - judge schuller is the planner. Yes, i do.
fits the profile.
and tony mecacci is most likely bosola the enforcer. What have you got on bosola?
uh, wofthe grid after his last trial.
JJ, put out a statewide apb and release mecacci's photo to the media.
judge schuller's a highly-respected man.
we can't just walk in there and accuse him of serial murder.
then i'll go to the attorney general and petition the chief justice if I have to.
and maybe not.
I believe you're looking for me.
you know we have to advise you of your rights.
I waive my constitutional rights against self-incrimination.
when you walked in here, you said,"i believe you're looking for me.
and I was right. - Your timing was impeccable.
but how could you know that?
I knew it wouldn't take you long to find me.
not after what i've left behind.
so you don't deny any of this?
why would i? What you see as a crime, I see as justice.
ray finnegan was a friend of mine.
ray finnegan was a criminal.
you should choose your friends more wisely.
it must have really thrown you when ray showed up at emma's funeral.
how do you know about my wife?
you have absolutely no idea who I am, do you?
ray told rossi you only meet bosola once.
so judge schuller had to have given him a list of names.
he never needs to see him again, just make final payment on proof of death.
have garcia hack into schuller's files and track his financial records before everything gets shut down.
and find out if his office made any calls.
they did. I spoke to them a few hours ago. I told them we had two suspects.
so he knows we're onto him.
he came here to stall.
he does have a list. There's more to come.
could we just get on with what I came here for? - Why?
so bosola can go on and carry on whatever it is you asked of him to do? No.
you call him and you end this.
even if I could, I wouldn't.
she was born emma louise taylor, 4th of july 1958.
you could get that from anywhere.
when she was 6, her dad john brought him a black and white homeless kitten.
if she knew you...
Emma would have told me.
she named it oscar, after oscar wilde.
and of all oscar wilde's work, she loved an ideal husband the most.
I don't know how you know all of this about emma or what you hope to achieve, but we're done.
you know the charges. Charge me.
is that what started all this insanity-- emma's death?
what started all of this was the 35 years I had to sit and watch as the system
I swore an oath to protect failed the very people our justice system was meant to protect.
I wonder what emma would make of all this.
every single person on that list deserves justice, and it's justice they managed to evade.
so... You do have a list.
I'm finished talking.
Oh-oh, we've got gobs of two-way traffic going on, which means someone is trying to bounce us out.
OK, bosola didn't come cheap, so judge schuller had to have made some pretty substantial transactions.
got wire transfers to a cayman island bank and that's where the trace ends.
how many, how much?
june, he debits numerations of $9, 999 every few days, total of 4, he takes a break for a few weeks until he makes his final transaction for the same magic number.
anything less than $10, 000 keeps the irs off your trail.
I know that, too.
so, the final payment must be for proof of death.
that makes $50, 000 the price of a kill.
he did that 3 times over a period of 12 months, but 2 days ago, he raided his account for $100, 000 all in one hit.
he also closed all his accounts and handed his entire estate over to a victims support group.
someone who isn't suffering from too many brainiacs in the high-tech kitchen just bounced us out.
good job.
if our calculations are correct, there are 2 more names on that list. - There are.
every single person on that list deserves justice.
he said deserves, not deserved.
now look. Right there. He looked at his watch for the second time.
whatever he's waiting for is about to happen.
I don't think you knew emma at all.
at least not the one I knew.
I made an excuse for myself that I wouldn't be welcome at her funeral.
but the truth is, I couldn't face it.
you knowing emma changes nothing.
Oh, but it does.
Emma changed the lives of everyone she knew.
but at least ray and I saw her death for what it truly was
a tragic accident.
Dan patton was drunk.
he murdered emma, as surely as if he put a gun to her head.
is that why his photo's not here?
you're saving the best for last?
we need to locate dan patton now.
the 100, 000 must be for some serious extras.
how many other people have you targeted?
I want the truth.
I have nothing more to say.
Oh, but I do.
I ran into emma, by chance, a few years ago, at a hotel in manhattan.
I was working on a case, so was she.
I knew she was married.
but I didn't care.
she... She wouldn't.
no. Emma would not do that to me.
you're lying.
I want the truth. - You first.
Dan patton is the last one. There are no more.
now, tell me the truth.
that night in manhattan, she told me our connection was so strong, it could never happen only once.
and I was fine with that.
please. Please don't. I have nothing, no money, nothing. Nothing
please, please don't kill me. - This isn't about money.
this is about the murder of emma schuller.
Emma? Oh, god. Emma--that was-- that was an accident. Please.
no, that was an accident. Please--please don't
at least...
you now know what kind of man you're working with.
what kind of man are you, judge?
I've had enough of seeing the guilty walk free of their sins.
but what about your sins?
I got cancer for mine.
maybe he's still at work.
workplace said he left for the day.
Dan patton, this is the fbi.
clear!
one to the heart, one to the head.
we know who did it.
bosola has no way of getting off long island.
they're moving judge schuller. - What?
he's a high court judge. It makes it a federal case now.
what if bosola has no intention of leaving the island?
Garcia said the judge was giving his whole estate away?
his property, his money.
he closed out his accounts and paid off his utility bills.
he has cancer, but he still has 6 months to live.
is there a reason he's paying off all his bills now?
not to mention the 100, 000 he made as a last and final payment for not one, but 2 kills.
usually the judge waits for confirmation of death before making final payment.
only this time he knew he wouldn't be around to see it.
here he comes! - Oh, there he is.
judge schuller!
judge schuller is helping us with a federal investigation.
wait a minute. What? I can't hear you. Speak up.
judge schuller, does this have anything to do with the recent rash of murders?
I am of the belief that justice has been served.
Hotch, wait a minute. What?
no comment. - Judge schuller, can you confirm reports...
I lied. - What?
your status in this case?
everybody down! Get on the ground! Down on the ground! Stay down!
get down!
she was special to you.
I was just thinking...
when I first met emma, I knew I would love her for the rest of my life.
we were 12 years old.
she always said we were doomed to be star-crossed lovers, destined to wonder what might have been.
I never slept with her, you know.
that wasn't true what I said to schuller.
that was just to get under his skin, knock him off his game.
I understand.
I should have married her, though.
when I left the marines, I was recruited by the bureau, spent a few years on the streets, got involved with starting the bau.
and before I knew it, a lifetime had gone by.
I hear you.
I missed a life with emma because I became obsessed with the chase.
with the hunt.
Dave, he's threatening my family.
and we'll get foyet, aaron.
then what's your point?
you have a family.
when all this is over, what are you gonna do...
to make sure you're not a lonely guy wondering why you let the purest thing in your life...
get away?
going somewhere?
hear the joke about the two irishmen
Yeah, i heard it. Didn't find it funny the first time.
I have always found that mercy bears richer fruit than strict justice.
abraham lincoln.
drew. Drew, just-- just stop.
I get it. That's why allison is with you.
Oh, god. I am dealing with it.
well, you took her from me, remember?
Ben, i thought you paid the bill.
what are you doing?
any closer and the image will distort.
how is jack?
Haley?
to be honest, we're moving them to a halfway house.
I thought you had found a permanent location.
Haley made a number of phone calls to her mother.
it's all good, but to be safe, we have to move them.
Sam, thank you.
I promise you, no harm will come to them.
you just concentrate on getting foyet.
happy birthday, buddy.
you got a second?
sure, what is it?
a case just came in.
I'll be right there.
actually, I need to talk to you.
it's on commack, long island. - That's your home town.
Yeah. And if it's ok, i'd rather stay behind.
Why?
it was a different life, one I left 30 years ago.
I'm in no hurry to go back. - Well...
any other day, i'd say stay, but I just became aware of this.
what have we got?
Ben vanderwaal was killed in commack, long island, last night, shot at close range, once in the heart, once in the head, . 22 caliber shell.
they found hair and blood traces from ben vanderwaal's wife heather.
but not heather?
no, she's still missing, presumed dead.
the caliber and placement of the bullets match that of two previous victims.
the first, rita haslat.
8 months ago she went missing from her home in new jersey.
4 weeks later, she was found in a trash bin.
she went from that to this in under 3 weeks?
she's totally emaciated.
ligature marks on her wrists and ankles indicate she was constrained.
one in the heart, one in the head-- same as vanderwaal.
sounds more like an execution.
then why cut off vanderwaal's hands postmortem?
what about the third victim?
bill levington. His appearance was certainly altered.
his genitals were missing.
though the method of mutilation is different in each crime, clearly there's a signature.
the question is, what?
wheels-up in 20 minutes. - What's this?
you told me you were cleared to travel. You lied.
naughty boy. - Uh, no, i didn't.
I am a doctor, so technically, I wasn't a lie.
what was it, then?
second opinion.
you're my bitch now.
force without justice is tyrannical.
blaise pascal.
in the ben vanderwaal case, his hands were taken.
uh, bill levington, his genitals.
only in the rita haslat case she was starved and tortured, then executed, and there's no sign of postmortem mutilation.
why would he take heather vanderwaal and not simply kill her?
maybe he hasn't and she's still alive.
the only thing concrete is the m. O. which depicts an efficient no-nonsense murderer.
well, then we need to figure out what each act of mutilation means to the unsub.
or to the victim.
it's pretty much how we found it. There's no signs of forced entry.
it says in the file that heather vanderwaal has a daughter. Where is she?
she moved to san diego to live with her real father.
Ben and heather vanderwaal have only been married a couple of years.
so heather came in, she dropped her shopping bags, her cell phone, and her keys, but not her coat.
she turns on the lights.
but they didn't work, because the phone and the electricity were cut.
something in this room attracted her attention.
what is it?
marks in the blood look like a camera tripod.
serial killers, especially sexual sadists, often document their kill.
but sexual sadists usually torture their victims while they're still alive.
you still didn't find any conflicting dna?
no. No prints, no fibers, nothing.
nobody heard any shots? - No.
Oh, excuse me.
yeah? All right.
Heather vanderwaal was just found wandering the streets half hour ago.
she's at brookside general.
get jj over there.
a killer this sophisticated doesn't leave a living witness without a reason.
Heather, my name is agent jareau.
I have some questions for you.
so you came home, you tried to turn the lights on, but they didn't work.
what did you do next?
I saw a light. A flash.
I opened the door, and ben was there, tied to a chair.
I think he was dead.
there was another flash.
it blinded me for a moment.
did you see your attacker? - No.
did he say anything? - No.
I heard this noise.
what kind of noise?
sawing.
I watched him cut off ben's hand.
why didn't he kill me?
excuse me.
we've been getting to know heather vanderwaal.
I can't tell you her favorite beatle, but I can tell you she was living la vida unhappy.
what did you find?
her ex-husband took her daughter allison out of school mid-term.
after that, heather cut a check for $5, 000 to a place called lewis, bell,& peters 6 days ago.
law firm? - Family law.
Thanks.
Mrs. Vanderwaal...
at mid-term you moved your daughter out of school?
Yes, i did.
after that, you filed for divorce from ben.
this man left you alive for a reason.
I need to know if these two things are connected.
a few months ago, I found a picture of allison on ben's phone.
your daughter.
she was naked.
where was it taken? - I couldn't tell.
did you confront him? - Yes.
he claimed that allison sent it to him by mistake.
she meant to send it to another student at her school.
it's called sexting.
what did allison say?
she said ben took it, but she--she lies.
Allison, she's a liar.
she caused us a lot of trouble, you know?
she wasn't lying about this, though, was she?
no.
the hand removal is less than surgical.
he used a basic double-toothed saw.
so, the guy we're looking for has no medical training.
not the kind i've had.
one in the heart, one in the brain, close range.
the second one was right up behind the ear.
how about gunshot residue?
surprisingly little.
maybe it's because the killer was using a . 22
small caliber, small discharge.
what is it?
ballistics can't match the bullets to a gun.
there were no rifling marks on the bullet.
there's only one explanation for that.
well, if anyone had a motive to kill ben vanderwaal, it was heather's ex-husband.
but he was in san diego, and he has no connection to the other two victims.
david rossi, we finally get to meet.
detective gil hardesty. Very, very nice to have you with us.
Morgan, what did you find?
in all cases, the . 22 caliber bullets had no rifling marks.
and without the barrel being rifled, the bullets would have very little velocity.
he would have to shoot his victim pointblank. - Jj.
this guy's using a zip gun. Now, if you know what you're doing, a piece of plumbing or a kid's bicycle pump can be turned into a gun.
one in the heart, one in the head.
untraceable, expandable bullets tell me without question, - all of these kills were strictly business. - A hitman?
what about the postmortem mutilation?
a contract sometimes includes extras.
the camera is not for sexual gratification, it's for proof of death.
so we could be looking for two people?
maybe. Maybe more. - Excuse me.
I may be able to hit on some old contacts, but i'll need to do it alone.
contacts? - Do we want to know?
best not.
we don't open till 5: 30.
I'm looking for the owner of that coat.
is that right?
not with that you're not.
check out the front and back.
you're either a dead man or a cop. Which one is it?
right now i'm just an old friend.
you gave up that right the day you became a fed.
I thought you retired. Writing books?
what can I tell you, ray?
some habits are hard to break.
I try this damn puzzle every morning.
never gets any easier.
crater creator.
you know, I work with a kid who can solve this whole thing in 5 minutes.
he must be smarter than both of us.
that's for sure.
so what's it been, 30 years? - 33.
you know, i thought at the very least I would see you at emma's funeral.
I, um... Need to ask you a favor.
she loved you as much as you loved her.
Hey, ambition's a bitch, ain't it?
I'm not here to talk about emma.
what are you here to talk about?
you've read the news? - You think I got something to do with that?
you should stick to writing books.
this guy is real specific.
he uses a zip gun and then throws in extras.
for a smart guy, your coming back here was a real dumb move.
not as dumb as the one that sean made.
he's on trial for the transportation of weapons, no doubt for you.
and what about the rico beef hanging over your head?
you help me, and you'll be assisting a federal investigation.
and what exactly is that gonna do for my reputation?
if you don't, you may not have one to protect.
our organized crime unit is very close to shutting you down permanently.
keep talking.
the removal of the hands is as specific as rita haslat's condition was when she was found.
just as specific as the removal of bill levington's genitals.
there's a message in the mutilations the unsub wants us to know.
I got something here that might help us with
technically, we have something here that might help with that.
bill levington was involved in a serial rape case, all involving minors, and it never went to trial.
Rita haslat?
a former social worker, attained said former status when she was fired from the dcfs for gross negligence.
in one of her cases, a 7-year-old boy starved to death.
which explains why haslat was so emaciated when she was found.
if all the victims were indicated in crimes against children, then we've found a connection.
one of the unsubs has access to the crimes of the victims and probably works in the justice system.
Garcia? - On it.
all right, well, we know what the victims have in common, we just need to find out who they have in common.
wait. This social worker and the suspected rape case, those were matters of record.
Ben vanderwaal's relationship with his stepdaughter is not.
unless the stepdaughter told someone else.
I'll call rossi.
I'll have the daughter brought in.
and all 3 crimes were against children?
OK. Thanks, prentiss.
Cuban, no doubt.
contraband?
some laws are just plain unjust.
you know, those 3 individuals messed with kids.
they got what they deserve.
that all depends on your definition of justice.
it's the same as when we were kids.
you do what you gotta do to survive.
what about this guy?
Yeah. There's only one guy that's this specific.
name?
I spoke to heather last night.
I knew for a long time something was off, but this-- why didn't you tell me?
Mr. Sandweiss, allison is the victim here.
I just want to know the truth from her, for once.
I told you, I don't know what they're talking about.
Allison, we have the pictures your stepfather took of you.
he was always home before mom.
we just talked at first.
why didn't you tell your mom?
I knew she'd tell dad, and he always said he'd kill anyone who laid a hand on me.
and did he?
how long has he been operating?
20 years. He's a ghost.
I've heard that name. Bosola.
he's a character in a play.
Jacobean tragedy called the duchess of malfi.
bosola brutally slays the duchess.
it wouldn't be a tragedy if he didn't.
is he local?
I don't care about the rico beef.
what about sean?
federal prison, out in 2.
all right.
I'll bring you bosola tonight.
you better bring the marine corps.
Allison, did you ever tell anyone about what your stepfather was doing?
I told my therapist.
he said I act out because I crave attention.
I'm so sorry, daddy.
you have nothing to be sorry for.
we need his name, please. Your therapist.
am I a suspect?
not yet, mr. Sorum.
what is your professional opinion of allison?
you mean was she sexually abused by her stepfather? No question.
and you reported it. - Of course.
to the police? - Absolutely.
how far did they take it?
they had it reviewed by the state.
did the police interview her?
they came to my office. Allison wanted nothing to do with it. Case closed.
just like the 380, 000 cases of child abuse reported in this country each year.
less than one percent gets to trial.
does that make you want to even the odds?
every time I listen to a child vividly recount the most horrific acts of abuse done at the hands of a father, an uncle, someone they're supposed to trust...
it's all I can do not to break down.
but that's all i'm capable of.
after that, like you, I trust in the justice system.
Rossi. - Midnight. My restaurant.
most people never meet bosola.
those that do only ever meet him once.
if he smells a fed, i'm gonna end up like the duchess.
now, that would be a tragedy.
I've never said anything out of turn, ever, have i?
go on.
always you've treated me like a son.
I'm closing the restaurant tonight.
you and the boys take the night off.
I can't let you do this alone.
I'm not helping the feds.
I'm helping an old friend.
good night. Go on.
he dims the lights, we go in.
so, uh, jack's what, 4 today? - Yeah.
and I literally have no idea where he is.
he's safe.
I saw prentiss and morgan up the block, but the two agents in the sedan, they're not with us.
that the counter surveillance in case foyet is watching me.
for which, apparently, there's no more money.
Yeah, i heard.
did somebody call you?
they're concerned. - What did you say?
what i'm telling you. An attack against you is an attack against all of us.
why are you calling? You ok?
I hope you got some good guys out there.
this man is a mean son of a bitch.
we're all over. He's not gonna know what hit him.
Hey, that kid-- the, uh, smart one-- I could use a little help.
Reid? - Reid here.
crossword question. 10 letters. Crater creator.
10 letters, crater creator.
arctangent.
did you get that? - Damn, she's smart.
did you see that-- flash?
I saw that. - He's already in there.
all units, go, go, go!
Morgan's out canvassing the area.
this whole place is swarming with cops.
we had the streets, the building, even the damn roof covered.
how the hell did he get through us?
Garcia traced finnegan's phone calls.
he made one at 4: 38 to a pre-paid cell, another one to you at 11: 41.
we gave bosola 7 hours to prepare.
I think he was here before we arrived.
and he heard ray call me. This is all my fault.
now he knows we're onto him. - He's not the only one.
whoever he works for does, too.
each mutilation represents the crimes the unsubs believe these 3 individuals committed.
unsubs? - Unknown subjects.
2. Both male. Unsub "a" we're calling the planner.
he works in the criminal justice system.
we're looking at both defense and prosecution attorneys, judges, and even cops.
we believe that the planner has experienced a devastating personal tragedy of some sort.
and because of the sophisticated nature of the scenario, we believe unsub "a" is in his late 50s or 60s.
the planner likely met unsub "b," the enforcer, within the court system.
he's been hired to carry out justice.
now, this type of justice does not come cheap.
so the planner has access to substantial cash.
absolutely no attempt was made to hide the mutilation.
this suggests the planner either doesn't care what we find or he wants us to find it.
now, the enforcer, on the other hand, has no such intentions.
he should be considered armed and extremely dangerous.
thank you. - All right. Let's go, people.
all final payments have been made.
I see no reason not to complete the tasks or to converse further.
good. One last request
I would like you to pay special attention to mr. Patton.
I've concentrated on the last 3 cases.
they've left the freshest e-prints. - Great.
not really. Over 100, 000 cases pass through long island court.
who had eyes on those files?
literally hundreds and hundreds of people.
change track. Focus on the enforcer.
Mob-related murder trials on long island the last 10 years.
we're looking for a hitman.
Hey, there are 93 mob trials in the last 10 years.
put aside any trials that resulted in a conviction.
weed out mistrials and arraignments.
uh, 19.
were any of those on trial suspected of being hitmen or enforcers?
3-- - whoa, whoa, whoa, this totally slipped the net.
Tony mecacci--his case was judged a mistrial, but check out his suspected victim.
.22 caliber, right? - Bull's-eye.
cross-match our profile of the planner against all those connected with this trial.
let's see--prosecuting lawyer garrett daniels, judge boyd schuller, criminal defense lawyer paul
wait, wait. Did you say judge schuller?
Yeah, here's a photo. - What's wrong?
do you know him? - No. But I knew his wife.
2 years ago she was driving home from work and she was killed by a drunk driver.
that could be the tragedy.
she was the love of his life, that's for sure.
12 months ago, judge schuller took a leave of absence due to health issues.
he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He has 6 months to live.
and that's when the killing started.
you don't seriously think judge-- - judge schuller is the planner. Yes, i do.
fits the profile.
and tony mecacci is most likely bosola the enforcer. What have you got on bosola?
uh, wofthe grid after his last trial.
JJ, put out a statewide apb and release mecacci's photo to the media.
judge schuller's a highly-respected man.
we can't just walk in there and accuse him of serial murder.
then i'll go to the attorney general and petition the chief justice if I have to.
and maybe not.
I believe you're looking for me.
you know we have to advise you of your rights.
I waive my constitutional rights against self-incrimination.
when you walked in here, you said,"i believe you're looking for me.
and I was right. - Your timing was impeccable.
but how could you know that?
I knew it wouldn't take you long to find me.
not after what i've left behind.
so you don't deny any of this?
why would i? What you see as a crime, I see as justice.
ray finnegan was a friend of mine.
ray finnegan was a criminal.
you should choose your friends more wisely.
it must have really thrown you when ray showed up at emma's funeral.
how do you know about my wife?
you have absolutely no idea who I am, do you?
ray told rossi you only meet bosola once.
so judge schuller had to have given him a list of names.
he never needs to see him again, just make final payment on proof of death.
have garcia hack into schuller's files and track his financial records before everything gets shut down.
and find out if his office made any calls.
they did. I spoke to them a few hours ago. I told them we had two suspects.
so he knows we're onto him.
he came here to stall.
he does have a list. There's more to come.
could we just get on with what I came here for? - Why?
so bosola can go on and carry on whatever it is you asked of him to do? No.
you call him and you end this.
even if I could, I wouldn't.
she was born emma louise taylor, 4th of july 1958.
you could get that from anywhere.
when she was 6, her dad john brought him a black and white homeless kitten.
if she knew you...
Emma would have told me.
she named it oscar, after oscar wilde.
and of all oscar wilde's work, she loved an ideal husband the most.
I don't know how you know all of this about emma or what you hope to achieve, but we're done.
you know the charges. Charge me.
is that what started all this insanity-- emma's death?
what started all of this was the 35 years I had to sit and watch as the system
I swore an oath to protect failed the very people our justice system was meant to protect.
I wonder what emma would make of all this.
every single person on that list deserves justice, and it's justice they managed to evade.
so... You do have a list.
I'm finished talking.
Oh-oh, we've got gobs of two-way traffic going on, which means someone is trying to bounce us out.
OK, bosola didn't come cheap, so judge schuller had to have made some pretty substantial transactions.
got wire transfers to a cayman island bank and that's where the trace ends.
how many, how much?
june, he debits numerations of $9, 999 every few days, total of 4, he takes a break for a few weeks until he makes his final transaction for the same magic number.
anything less than $10, 000 keeps the irs off your trail.
I know that, too.
so, the final payment must be for proof of death.
that makes $50, 000 the price of a kill.
he did that 3 times over a period of 12 months, but 2 days ago, he raided his account for $100, 000 all in one hit.
he also closed all his accounts and handed his entire estate over to a victims support group.
someone who isn't suffering from too many brainiacs in the high-tech kitchen just bounced us out.
good job.
if our calculations are correct, there are 2 more names on that list. - There are.
every single person on that list deserves justice.
he said deserves, not deserved.
now look. Right there. He looked at his watch for the second time.
whatever he's waiting for is about to happen.
I don't think you knew emma at all.
at least not the one I knew.
I made an excuse for myself that I wouldn't be welcome at her funeral.
but the truth is, I couldn't face it.
you knowing emma changes nothing.
Oh, but it does.
Emma changed the lives of everyone she knew.
but at least ray and I saw her death for what it truly was
a tragic accident.
Dan patton was drunk.
he murdered emma, as surely as if he put a gun to her head.
is that why his photo's not here?
you're saving the best for last?
we need to locate dan patton now.
the 100, 000 must be for some serious extras.
how many other people have you targeted?
I want the truth.
I have nothing more to say.
Oh, but I do.
I ran into emma, by chance, a few years ago, at a hotel in manhattan.
I was working on a case, so was she.
I knew she was married.
but I didn't care.
she... She wouldn't.
no. Emma would not do that to me.
you're lying.
I want the truth. - You first.
Dan patton is the last one. There are no more.
now, tell me the truth.
that night in manhattan, she told me our connection was so strong, it could never happen only once.
and I was fine with that.
please. Please don't. I have nothing, no money, nothing. Nothing
please, please don't kill me. - This isn't about money.
this is about the murder of emma schuller.
Emma? Oh, god. Emma--that was-- that was an accident. Please.
no, that was an accident. Please--please don't
at least...
you now know what kind of man you're working with.
what kind of man are you, judge?
I've had enough of seeing the guilty walk free of their sins.
but what about your sins?
I got cancer for mine.
maybe he's still at work.
workplace said he left for the day.
Dan patton, this is the fbi.
clear!
one to the heart, one to the head.
we know who did it.
bosola has no way of getting off long island.
they're moving judge schuller. - What?
he's a high court judge. It makes it a federal case now.
what if bosola has no intention of leaving the island?
Garcia said the judge was giving his whole estate away?
his property, his money.
he closed out his accounts and paid off his utility bills.
he has cancer, but he still has 6 months to live.
is there a reason he's paying off all his bills now?
not to mention the 100, 000 he made as a last and final payment for not one, but 2 kills.
usually the judge waits for confirmation of death before making final payment.
only this time he knew he wouldn't be around to see it.
here he comes! - Oh, there he is.
judge schuller!
judge schuller is helping us with a federal investigation.
wait a minute. What? I can't hear you. Speak up.
judge schuller, does this have anything to do with the recent rash of murders?
I am of the belief that justice has been served.
Hotch, wait a minute. What?
no comment. - Judge schuller, can you confirm reports...
I lied. - What?
your status in this case?
everybody down! Get on the ground! Down on the ground! Stay down!
get down!
she was special to you.
I was just thinking...
when I first met emma, I knew I would love her for the rest of my life.
we were 12 years old.
she always said we were doomed to be star-crossed lovers, destined to wonder what might have been.
I never slept with her, you know.
that wasn't true what I said to schuller.
that was just to get under his skin, knock him off his game.
I understand.
I should have married her, though.
when I left the marines, I was recruited by the bureau, spent a few years on the streets, got involved with starting the bau.
and before I knew it, a lifetime had gone by.
I hear you.
I missed a life with emma because I became obsessed with the chase.
with the hunt.
Dave, he's threatening my family.
and we'll get foyet, aaron.
then what's your point?
you have a family.
when all this is over, what are you gonna do...
to make sure you're not a lonely guy wondering why you let the purest thing in your life...
get away?
going somewhere?
hear the joke about the two irishmen
Yeah, i heard it. Didn't find it funny the first time.
I have always found that mercy bears richer fruit than strict justice.
abraham lincoln.
Friday?
it's far too early for this.
traitor!
all right, I surrender.
well, I'm awake now!
stirred up with envy and revenge"!
I'll get you back and when you lease expect it.
still, out of good, means to find evil.
let me out.
let me out!
you're lucky that trap's not finished.
it's getting poison spikes fitted tomorrow.
I will kill you, crusoe, or die in the attempt.
that... that was my pledge.
OK! You not hold me.
game's over, friday.
and when I get out...
you got a fever? You look like you're sick.
save your false words.
poison?
poison! - Snakebite?
so, you confess.
what's your medicine for snakebites?
wily snake!
infernal serpent!
tell me. You have to help me.
I am not your lieutenant!
look at me. This is serious! Hey, friday! Don't pass out on me.
no, no, no! Friday?
enemy...
of mankind.
I will get you an antidote, ok?
you'll be all right.
you have my word.
traitor. Traitor.
what we needed was gangrene, much less sawing and tearing off the leg.
one more word, it'll be your last, I swear.
snakebite.
Snakebite!
Antivenom: Jergon sacha." Jergon sacha!
if it is a nurse, save you.
I need your help!
that's what you promised me last time.
God! You're stealing.
I need antidote jergon sacha.
snakebite? - Where is it?
show me the wound. - It's not me. It's friday.
don't do that.
two days it took me to sort things out.
from a to j, from k to Z. - Jergon sacha.
which is the parasitic vine.
it has to be freshly harvested before it flowers.
distinctive bites of the snake.
it should be chopped, immersed and immediately ingested.
you've been doing your homework.
there's only 2 things that get you left alone on a ship:
standing in a crow's-nest and learning a medical book.
and surgeons don't climb rigging.
he'll be dead by now.
what?
immediately ingested. It's an urgent cure.
I'm sorry. You're too late.
Oh, I shouldn't have left him.
he didn't know me.
he swore he'd kill me.
it doesn't sound like snakebite to me.
if it's not a snakebite, he could still be alive.
come with me. Come and see. No, no! Listen! Listen.
I'll give you anything you want.
everything I have is yours: Money, gold. Please.
this is the last thing I'll ask of you, I swear. Please.
all right.
Hello, boy.
Friday!
on his shoulder!
evil for you. I'll do good so as to fight evil.
why do I do evil?
hold him still.
and the thought of lost happiness "and lasting pain, torments him.
where have I heard those words?
round he throws his baleful eyes "that witness'd huge affliction and dismay.
paradise lost. I've been reading it to him.
Milton?
Mix'd with obdurate pride and stedfast hate.
have you nothing lighter than the fall of mankind?
how about a sonnet?
I see thy fall determined.
Where's his part of the castle?
up here.
well, I can guess who had first choice of bedroom.
he prefers things natural.
what are we looking for?
anything he could've eaten or drunk, tracks from a snake or scorpion.
you don't know, do you?
honey? - Don't!
it was no snakebite.
your friend was stung by a wasp.
there was 2 puncture marks.
two of them.
enough to poison him?
it's not... don't blame the wasp.
it's the honey that is poisoned.
they were just protecting it.
is there an antidote?
I need to look it up.
where?
my books, back in the camp.
And?
I like you better the other way.
come on, get inside. Let's go. Let's go. There's a timeline here.
put it down and lend us a hand.
it's called a mallet.
sir, there's a fellow in need up there.
where is he?
No! No, no, no!
poisoned honey.
causes: Hallucinations, delusions, high fever and, if untreated, death.
what are you doing?
the men are losing patience with you.
I had to amputate a leg today.
if he dies, you are...
maybe I'll amputate your insolent tongue, boy.
now get me a drink!
quicker!
here.
more.
anaesthetic.
put him over here.
he'll be more comfortable there. Are you all right?
that I'm not, a lot of rage.
they shouldn't let him bully you.
they?
they're just watching their own skin.
OK, let me see.
Yes! An antidote.
I've never seen this plant on this island.
do you know it?
no, I don'T.
Tropical," which is promising, "grows in rock - exposed areas.
tolerates harsh environment, direct sun.
if it's here, I know where it'll be.
crush the leaves. Boil until water clears." Good.
listen. How much time do I have?
only hours.
his fever hadn't taken hold.
when it does...
find the plant quickly and I'd say he has a chance.
thank you.
it's rude to sneak up on people.
your friend is right to think you're simple.
my friend does not think me simple.
Satan, then. I would've stuck with simple. We should hurry.
we?
what colour of flower has this plant?
what hue of leaf?
you'll poison him with a guess.
I won't have my work undone by ignorance.
whatever you say, olivia-oliver.
this way.
for you send a plague!
did you think I'd be afraid, crusoe?
where are you, crusoe?
come out! Come out!
have a drink.
you like to give orders, don't you?
excuse me. Would you like a drink?
was that rowley?
you should've let me deal with him.
Rowley doesn't frighten me.
no man frightens me.
I can see inside them because of what I am.
obviously, I have to cut a hole in them first.
you can't see a man's soul or a man's spirit with a knife.
snake!
I know that move.
it's called overreaction.
does your book say anything about having the time to play games?
it was for future reference: Jergon sacha, snake antivenom.
look. See how it resembles the one it can cure?
it's funny how nature pairs things: A natural pair for every being.
yours is in a cage under a tree palace, speaking poems.
mine is in england waiting for me.
my wife, susannah.
what would susannah think about you raiding your enemy's camp, risking your life for your new friend?
before friday, I merely existed.
he showed me how to live.
if I do get off this island and back to susannah, it's because of him.
that's why it hurt so much when he called me a traitor.
I'm sure you've heard worse.
I've heard the same for a crime just as great.
which was?
monmouth's rebel army was gathering against the king.
I was travelling, too, on trade.
a family to feed.
I didn't know the rebels had already been routed.
the king's soldiers were hunting them down.
all those involved were branded traitors and sentenced to death.
help from you, sir.
will you help a stranger?
what can I do?
can you spare some water?
it's not for me.
it's for the boy.
I heard cannon fire last night.
that was the rebellion, such as it was.
it's over?
we had the lord on our side.
the king had the cavalry.
we were all lined up for a night attack when their muskets shelled upon us.
thank you.
here, my son.
he's changed his mind.
we can only keep moving, sir.
the king's men will have us if we don'T.
are you one of us, sir?
I'm... I'm just a merchant.
vouch for yourself.
king james will not forgive any man that has stood up against him.
I expect they'll hunt us all down now after this.
where will you go?
the boy asked for his mother.
I'm taking him to her.
who's there?
who else?
no one. I'm alone.
I'll take as much of the fine lace as you can make.
that'll give you 5% of the asking price if you give me 6 weeks to pay it.
search the outbuildings.
you've nothing to fear from the rebels.
they've taken the worst of it.
God bless them.
bless them, indeed.
you're not a supporter.
just looking out for my family.
but not their future.
who's is that horse outside?
mine. What of it?
who are you?
I'm robinson crusoe, here to do business with abigail furnham, the lace maker.
I'll see your letter of passage.
sir, rebels! They've been hiding them in the barn!
sir, go!
arrest the lace maker and robinson crusoe!
he's getting away! After him!
she saved my life that day and I could do nothing for her.
I knew they'd show her no mercy.
what did you think of her?
brave or foolish?
brave. This is the place.
if the plant's not here, then...
well, let's hope it is and that we find it quickly.
you stay here.
I'm gonna continue further on up to the rocks.
please?
Oh, good.
don't shout that. Not ever!
no one will hear.
one word, one careless moment and I'm your lace maker, except death would be a welcome relief.
I'm sorry, truly.
now, is that your plant?
forever in need of an assistant.
I've always had a keen eye.
that's our plant.
at once "as far as angels ken, he views...
the dismal situation waste and wild.
a dungeon horrible.
a dungeon horrible on all sides round.
a dungeon horrible on all sides round.
on all sides round as one great furnace flam'D.
as one great furnace flam'D.
yet... - "yet from those flames...
...no light.
but rather darkness visible.
so!
I'll control your descent.
my descent?
you're lighter. It's safer.
standing up here is much safer.
you scared of heights?
I could lower you down.
I'll go alone.
you don't trust a woman?
when I give you a signal, you can help me back up.
does that still count as doing it alone?
just in case, what would you like on your gravestone?
Robin or robinson crusoe?
OK.
I can't climb up.
grab hold!
what's it tied to?
just take it.
I can't reach it.
don't look.
close your eyes.
ready.
let's hope our sacrifice is in time.
you've done your best.
I promised I'd be back for him.
I gave him my word.
a surgeon can give his word like that.
the patients don't call him a liar.
the world hears the praise of the living and thinks him a man of honour.
I don't care what the world thinks.
but I do care about those that matter most to me.
how did you get past the gates?
judge jefferies has named you a traitor to the king.
I know.
he had abigail furnham burned alive.
the rebels are on gibbets along the bridge-water road.
you shouldn't have come back.
I did not join them.
I did not break my promise. I need you to know that.
take the children and go back to your father.
he's disowned us.
what?
because i wouldn't disown you.
I don't--I don't know what to do.
I do. Will you trust me?
stay away from the windows.
I never meant to make this more dangerous for you.
I don't care about that.
I care about you.
Susannah's gone to mr. Blackthorn.
they've come up with a plan.
and it better be a good one.
I'm to sail to the new world.
when? - Today.
father, you will see me again.
I'm sure I will.
susannah will get me a pardon.
when it's safe for me to return, she'll put a notice in the gazette.
you'll never see that.
one way or another...
I will.
so, we mark about the crusoes...
we do choose our women well.
although to be honest, robin, I think they do the choosing.
perhaps you can find a space in your baggage for a keepsake of us.
your preacher's bible?
with the family history written in.
wherever you may find yourself, this is who you are.
you are my son.
always will be.
don't forget.
what will you do?
stay at home.
pay my taxes.
try not to draw attention.
what is it, boy? What is it?
he's gone.
this way.
out.
steadfast hate.
down! Down!
obdurate pride.
at least he's still alive.
you must be a brilliant surgeon.
what's happening?
stay away from the railings.
go, go, go! We need to keep him near. This way.
he's trying to kill you. Where else would he go?
now what?
give it to me.
now who's giving the orders?
it needs to be chopped.
that anaesthetic you have? - Yeah.
will it work from a dart?
Yes, it knocks out rowley. Why?
OK.
these are hollow.
and these are sailmaker's needles.
if I can fashion this into a dart and fill this with the anaesthetic,
I may be able to shoot it into friday.
a blowpipe? - Right.
if we can stop him from attacking me long enough, we may be able to give him the antidote.
that's a big "if.
I'm open to all sorts of ideas here.
here. - Thank you.
not a fan of milton?
pretentious pig.
he's a great poet.
how long do those need to boil?
until it clears.
ocean journeys are long.
even mediocre poets are a distraction.
I'll bet it's very lonely for you living as oliver.
why did you leave susannah?
leave her? No.
she was not on your ship.
I was returning to her.
then you had to leave? - No, I had no choice.
where there's life there is choice.
staying would've cost me my life.
I might as well have joined the rebels because, in the end, I had to flee like one.
Robin, don't argue, please.
if there was any other way out, we'd be taking it.
your wife knows what she's talking about.
you're a lucky man, robin.
she's more than I deserve.
let me pledge this.
you must agree to it, both of you.
should any mishap occur to you
and let us not suppose that it will-but if it did,
I will take full legal control of your children.
now you understand what this means?
one day, all that I have will be theirs.
why, for that, I'd be tempted to offer myself here and now.
that's more like it.
farewell, robin. - Thank you.
I put something in your bible to remember us by.
I love you.
I love you.
is that from the arrow?
no, it's nothing. - No, let me see.
I'm the surgeon. - What?
you can bandage better with one arm than I can with two?
like you can climb a cliff alone better than with my help.
it's noble to see someone risking so much for a friend.
old friend.
when friday recovers, promise me you won't tell him how worried I was.
I'll never hear the last of it.
you don't think we're too late, do you?
a dungeon horrible, on all sides round...
as one great furnace flam'D.
obdurate pride, steadfast hate.
you're ill.
listen to me, friday.
friday, we have a cure.
friday, you're my brother.
remember the boat in the tree?
Yes, you do.
remember the dogs and the games?
you trip me, I trip you.
the dogs. - The dogs.
that's right. Remember the caves?
returning the bones?
it's crusoe and it's friday.
obdurate pride.
you have to trust me.
we have an antidote.
you have to drink it or you will die.
die!
friday, no!
father!
please.
are you all right?
we've got to find him.
half in here.
we'll split up, cover more area.
half? He needs all of it.
fine, then. I'll take it. You stay here.
what if you go the wrong way or the right way and he attacks you again?
he's dying.
does he give up if he sets his mind to something?
I am not waiting here. I can't do nothing.
he's still alive. He will come back, won't he?
he's sworn to kill you. It's our only hope.
well then, I've done nothing but hope for the last 6 years.
nothing but "maybe" and "if.
nothing but nothing!
God can't keep taking people away from me.
no. No. No, not this.
Robin. - Crusoe.
it's crusoe.
Friday!
so, you let him kill you?
stand away from me.
if he tries to kill me, at least I'll know where he's at.
and if he succeeds, he'll drop his weapon and you can give him the antidote.
you'd die to save him?
Yes, I would.
your friend is right, you're so simple!
go on! Kill him!
put him out of his misery.
I need your help.
you didn't want to have your work undone by ignorance. Remember?
friday deserves to live.
maybe I don't, but he does.
help me?
Friday!
you want crusoe dead?
I will kill your traitor.
you're not the only one he has badly used.
father!
give me the antidote.
come on. Come on, friday.
drink.
are we in time?
we're lucky our charade worked.
you were lucky.
for a moment, I was thinking of putting a musket ball in, not just gunpowder.
it didn't only come from me.
I love susannah.
I made a vow before god and for my whole life.
you could be rotting halfway down a cliff right now.
your wife may be in london. - No, don'T. Don'T.
I never let men near me.
don't make me feel like the temptress, crusoe.
did I win your bed in a game?
I do not like it.
well, you'll have to win back yours.
I'm not feeling too well.
will you read for me?
just a minute.
you weren't the temptress, but
for my disguise?
thank you, olivia. - Oliver.
I think I'm hallucinating.
I saw a woman walking into the forest.
sounds more like a fantasy to me.
how about some sonnets instead?
Sonnets!
yo, hurry up!
don't start without me.
move your ass. Come on.
I'm gettin' your damn beer. - Shut up!
shut up, woman. - Shut up?
Oh, me shut up, huh?
shut up, everyone.
will, is that you?
will? - Here he comes.
he's down.
go on, get up. Get up.
don't be stupid.
we don't want any trouble.
take whatever you want.
I don't care what you want.
there's no reason to hurt anyone.
here it comes.
that had to hurt.
how could you possibly... Know what my reasons are?
our boy's trying to get up.
which one of them belongs to you?
let me guess.
Oh, please don't hurt him! Please.
it could be her.
kiss your husband goodbye.
why are you doing this? Why?
why not?
did you get that? - I got it, baby.
and how many dead?
OK. Yeah, we'll be there as soon as we can. Thanks.
well, i gotta go. Let me guess.
don't get comfortable. We've got 4 dead in a home invasion.
where we headed? - It's local. Southeast d. c.
what was the cause of death? - Blunt force trauma. No knife, no gun.
have we been invited in? - Yeah. Cops want us to meet them at the crime scene.
isn't southeast where all that vandalism's been lately?
same area, yeah. Think they could be connected?
I don't know. I mean, the weapon doesn't exactly fit the typical m. o.of a home invasion killer.
well, it's worth considering.
it's common for vandalism to escalate into violence.
plus there's a lot of anger out there. That neighborhood's mostly black working class.
Yeah. Now it's being gentrified while the people who live there are having a tough time.
were the victims wealthy? - Yeah, it was two couples.
the were both part of the influx of new wealth in the area.
police report a robbery? - Nothing was taken.
what race were the victims?
one couple was white, the other black.
not racially motivated.
JJ, find rossi and reid, tell them we leave in 5.
well, if this is related to vandalism, 4 dead is a hell of an escalation.
so there's the potential for a lot more bodies out there?
that's what i'm afraid of.
Kingman brewster jr. Said, "there is no lasting hope in violence, only temporary relief from hopelessness.
detective andrews? Jennifer jareau.
these are agents rossi, morgan, hotchner, prentiss, and dr. Reid.
thanks for getting here so fast. - What can you tell us?
looks like one of the victims was attacked when he got out of his car.
meaning whoever did this probably used his keys to get inside and surprise the other victims.
who found the bodies?
the cleaning woman. She's giving her statement now.
Dave, would you, morgan, and prentiss go inside. We'll cover out here.
I know you're all used to this, but, uh, it's a hell of a sight in there.
whoever did this ain't human.
the neighbors see anything?
Oh, you know, the patrol cars are even doubled in this area because of t vandalism-- Nothing.
the unsub would have to be extremely fast and efficient.
look at this. There's a pool of blood here and then drops as the victim moves toward the door.
how big was the victim? - 6'1," 6'2." Why?
well, if he was strong enough to move under his own power, you'd expect signs of a struggle.
and if not, there'd most likely be drag marks.
he was carried.
that's a lot of dead weight for one person to move alone.
there's no pool of blood on the porch, which means they didn't have to set him down to open the door.
victim one gets dropped here.
while number 2 comes around the corner to see what's happening, and...
the unsub attacks him here.
the female victims were probably here when the first attack occurred.
which means somebody would have to control them pretty quickly.
how many unsubs are you thinking?
at least one to move the body inside, another one to take out man number 2,
and one more to subdue the others.
well, vandalism breeds a pack mentality.
if it is the same unsubs, we're looking at a group of 3, maybe 4.
these aren't kids. They're too efficient.
there's a control and precision. Juveniles are sloppy.
he's right. There is nothing tentative about these kills.
there's no experimentation.
these guys know what they're doing.
I don't know. - What are you thinking?
I can understand vandalism escalating into violence, but that's usually gradual.
and assault, a single murder maybe, but come on, this?
this feels fully evolved.
september 3rd, 15 luxury cars had their windows smashed.
september 14th, a new upscale clothing boutique was vandalized.
september 24th, two different restaurants, both catering to a wealthy clientele, had their front windows smashed and their interiors torn apart, and finally, october 1st, a newly renovated townhome was ransacked before the family could move in.
so they went from attacking public property to a private residence, but no victim.
the question is, what makes them move from that... To this?
the vandalism targets were all symbols of the neighborhood's changing makeup and economy.
maybe there's something specific about these victims that set the unsubs off.
I've spoken to the victims' family members.
they've agreed to come in and help however they can.
Garcia, check social networking sites.
see if these unsubs have coordinated these attacks online.
if they dare tweet, I shall flush them out like a bird dog, sir.
we need to be asking how these unsubs manage to not stand out in this neighborhood.
each of these crime scene locations are a representation of new wealth and status, but the area surrounding the crime scenes are still populated by long-time residents who are slowly being pushed out.
that's a lot of disenfranchised people who are all part of the neighborhood makeup.
most likely these unsubs don't stand out because they're probably local themselves.
I don't know. I'm with rossi.
I mean, anger I get, but this much violence?
we're looking at at least 3 men with an incredible amount of rage.
where do you hide that?
you care to tell the lady why it's october 14th and she's still not ready to move into her house?
not particularly.
what did you just say?
it's ok. Really.
no, it's not. Why don't you apologize to the lady, answer the question.
my apologies, ma'am. Found a slight flaw in the foundation.
hate to think of you home all alone at night, suddenly the whole place just collapses underneath you.
OK. Now get back to the drywall. That's what I pay you for.
let somebody else worry about the foundation.
I had garcia run records on anyone in the target area who in the last year was foreclosed upon, filed for bankruptcy, or applied for unemployment and then narrowed that list down to men - between the ages of 25 and 45. - And?
713 hits.
victims' families are here.
I'm very sorry about your son.
we're looking to see if there's a pattern or if your son's killing was truly random.
so, there were no threats that you knew of?
no.
I understand this is very difficult for you.
we're just trying to make some sense of it.
please.
ms. Barnes, do you need some more time?
they said I could see william's body if I wanted to.
I don't see what good could come from that.
it was just you and your brother?
our parents died a few years ago.
I'm sorry.
I know that sounds like something people say, but...
I truly am sorry.
you deal with cases like this all the time.
Yes, i do.
so it's routine for you.
there's nothing routine about what you're going through, ms. Barnes.
do you have brothers and sisters?
I have two sisters.
what would you do if something like this happened to one of them?
I would do everything in my power to catch the people who did it.
will? Is that you? Will?
check this out.
whoa, man.
that's pretty wicked. - Yeah.
Hey, come look at this.
what did you just say?
what's his problem?
our boy's tryin' to get up.
please, don't hurt him! Please.
I say we go out.
why are you doing this? Why?
why not?
did you get that? - I got it.
you think?
people might see.
so?
I go first.
this your car? - Yeah.
it's nice.
look, i'm just picking up my girlfriend.
what the hell, man!
did anybody see anything?
it's in the middle of the damn parking lot.
what about the security cam? - It's only on the door.
who's the lady over there? - Manager.
she discovered the bodies when she came by to open up for the breakfast crowd.
I'll go talk to her. - Any idea who the victims are?
judging by the driver's license, one of them's a waitress here.
it says jessica miller, and the other one's probably doug taylor.
you can't tell for sure?
honestly, you can't make an i. d.by looking at them.
I didn't even know what it was at first when I pulled up.
they're definitely getting bolder. These kills were in public.
if this is supposed to be about symbolism, it's not anymore.
this is a blue collar restaurant, the victim is a waitress.
there's no ideology behind this. It's about violence and power.
they actually sat here and drank beer after the murders.
they're telling us that they don't care.
they're like those outlaws that ride into town and let you know the only way to stop them is by killing them.
if that's what they want, I know plenty of cops who'd be happy to oblige.
detective, we need to keep our heads. - Meaning what?
meaning that this level of nihilism, this randomness, it can have a mirror impact.
are you warning me not to go after some kind of revenge?
all i'm saying is this level of brutality is almost like a challenge from the unsubs, trying to drag everyone down to their level.
and it's a natural reaction.
I'm just doing my job.
let's head back. We've got our profile.
how bad? - Bad bad.
you have company.
ms. barnes.
sorry for just showing up like this.
I heard on the news that there were more victims and I didn't know where else to get answers.
please.
thank you.
so is it true? Was it the same people who killed william?
Yes.
do you have any suspects?
no, but we do have a profile of who these men might be.
two of our agents are giving it to the police right now and we're getting it to all the news outlets.
can you explain it to me? Please.
basically, these men are completely disenfranchised.
they feel like they have nothing to live for.
and they're looking for anyone or anything to blame.
there's a lot of anger out there. Times are tough.
but even so, these men will stand out.
they'll look to provoke confrontation.
any excuse, they'll take it.
they don't steal from their victims. They don't sexually assault the women.
this is about violence for violence's sake.
it's almost contagious. It's twisted.
but it's got its own momentum.
what we need to do is figure out how these men came together.
we feel certain that they have some connection to southeast d. c.
they go unnoticed.
they don't seem out of place.
we have no prints from the crime scenes, so we believe that the unsubs wear gloves.
DNA testing could take weeks, and we don't have that kind of time.
the majority of the population of southeast is black, but if the unsubs work in this area, they could be any race.
because of the physical nature of the murders and the amount of control these unsubs exert over their victims, we believe that these unsubs are large or at least extremely physically fit.
and they have a pack mentality.
canvass the local bars and restaurants.
see if there's a group of men who fit this description.
and these men will be obsessed with the media coverage.
any chance to relive their crimes.
so stake out the past crime scenes. There's a good chance that they'll revisit them.
they most likely come from troubled backgrounds, broken homes, youth detention centers.
they probably bonded over their anger.
and now it's like they've become one person.
it's their whole identity.
see, these guys, they think of themselves as some type of gangsters, like society's rules don't apply to them.
they equate violence with power and respect.
and that goes for self-respect as well.
what could they possibly get out of killing innocent people for no reason?
people like this, they're not like you and me. They don't feel empathy.
in a way, they only feel alive when they're creating fear and chaos.
and your profiles, they help catch these people?
they do.
thank you for helping me through this.
of course.
detective.
I just wanted to say that at the crime scene it was not my intention to accuse you of being unprofessional.
yeah?
it's just that I know what it's like to work a case that makes you question humanity, and it's not the worst thing to remind yourself to rise above it a little, or we lose ourselves.
I appreciate you giving the men the profile.
rage In Dupont!
Oh, no.
there's gonna
sir, i've got something.
I've been monitoring social networking sites to see if the unsubs communicate electronically.
right.
there's a text that's blowing up. I sent it to your phone.
there's over a thousand hits already.
it's a plan to vandalize cars and restaurants around dupont circle.
when does the text say this is supposed to happen?
tonight, 9:00.
dupont circle's not in the unsubs' usual comfort zone.
and it's not like these unsubs to share control.
detective andrews, this is agent hotchner.
I just sent you a text to which we've been alerted.
right. Absolutely. We're on our way.
you will be arrested if you do not disperse.
we got wagons at every entry point.
they're filling them up faster than I can bring them to holding.
what happened?
my men went to make arrests, people started resisting, I called for reinforcements.
do you know who the instigators are?
there's no rhyme or reason I can tell.
confiscate the cell phones.
when we get to the origins of the text message, you'll have your ringleaders.
they're still notifying families and processing most of the rioters.
did garcia come up with anything?
Yeah. She was able to isolate the first 2 cell phones in the chain.
detective, we don't think our unsubs are in there, but we'd still like to interrogate the possible ringleaders.
I don't think so.
but we need to eliminate them absolutely as suspects.
we can handle it on our own.
we're not saying you can't.
is there a problem?
you guys had my men out there canvassing bars looking for adults when I could have been doing gang sweeps, going through juvenile records.
that would have been a waste of your time.
in case you hadn't noticed, those are kids out there.
we don't believe last night's riot is connected to the murders.
how could it not be?
because the unsubs we're looking for are older.
they operate entirely out of southeast d. c.
they exercise extreme control over their victims, and violence is up close and personal.
none of what happened here last night fits the profile.
enough with the profile. I got probably a million dollars worth of damage.
I got two cops injured.
which was probably made worse by police overreaction.
meaning what? - I warned you.
cases like this, people get too emotional.
you're here as a guest of my department.
we're only trying to help.
if you're so sure none of those kids are the killers, why bother interrogating them at all?
because we need to be certain.
if we're right, if this is just some sort of teenage dare,
I guarantee you that the unsubs are going to respond very quickly.
I appreciate your insight, but we'd like to take things from here on our own.
thank you for everything you've done.
you're gonna want to start with these 2 names.
you're not helping. I want to speak to the officer in charge.
ms. barnes.
I need someone to tell me what's going on.
we're trying to figure it out.
are those the ones who killed william?
no, they're not. - But they started the riot.
they're just a bunch of stupid kids.
Yeah, who vandalize and attack people at random.
I told you these things have their own momentum.
are you sure? - I'm sorry.
so did you all have fun, huh? Do you even care that someone died?
ms. barnes, you really need to calm down.
no, no one cares. - That's not true.
no one cares. Someone dies and it's all just a game or a job and everyone just moves on.
that's not true. People do care, and I care.
they killed my brother for no reason!
please. Let me walk you outside and get you some air. Please.
walk with me. It's ok.
it's all right.
I've logged into police dispatch for the area you've isolated.
if anything's reported, we'll know when they know.
wait, are we staying on the case?
we all know that these unsubs are gonna react to last night's riot.
but emily's right. They asked us to step aside.
Andrews is a good cop. He's just too emotional right now.
if we don't stay on, with or without his permission, he and all the rest of us will regret it.
Where's morgan?
uh, he's with ms. Barnes.
you sure you're gonna be all right?
you know, i'm not crazy, really.
Tamara, you've been through a trauma, and you're processing a lot.
it's normal to lose it a little.
thank you. For everything.
I'm just doing my job. - No, you're...
you're a good person.
so how's this gonna end?
what?
the investigation. I mean, what happens?
well, if I had to guess, last night's riots-- our unsubs aren't gonna like it.
this is their whole identity.
they're not gonna like sharing the attention.
so more people are gonna die.
they're killing in a small area. Our profile is solid.
somebody will recognize them.
you don't think it's gonna be that easy.
I really need to get back to my team.
Yeah. I'm sorry. Thank you for, uh, driving me home.
you're welcome.
agent morgan.
do you think you can get these guys?
we're closing in.
and they're bound to start feeling it.
see, guys like this, when they feel trapped, they most likely commit suicide by cop.
good.
where the hell do you think you're going?
I talked to the beat cops.
they're getting word out to local businesses to keep an eye out for anyone who seems agitated by the news of last night's riot.
by now, andrews has to know that none of those kids are the unsubs.
then he's bound to beef up police presence in the southeast.
we should be there, too.
the faster we can react, the more we can help.
do you think the unsubs know about the riot?
front page news. I don't know how they can't.
and if the profile's right?
their reaction's gonna be quick and it's gonna be brutal.
basically, it's like knowing that lightning is gonna strike but not being able to pinpoint where.
3 drafts.
I'm sorry, you can't have that in here.
what? This?
it's a liability issue, that's all, in case somebody gets hurt.
no problem.
can we have a talk? - Yeah. What's up?
uh, first I would like to say that I love you, and i--i--the thing I love the most about you is how much you care about people
Garcia, what? What's going on?
I think you need to cut contact with tamara barnes.
I didn't make contact with her. She was at the police station.
Yeah, ok, look me in the eye and tell me that the first break in this case you don't run right to her and give her the news yourself.
Penelope, she lost her brother. She just wants answers.
I get it. I volunteer counseling these families.
I know what she's going through.
then where is this coming from?
OK, let's just ignore the whole ethical dilemma, 'cause that's just too, too big.
and if you were to testify on this case, the whole thing would unravel if anyone were to find out that - you're involved with a member of the victim's family. - Whoa, stop.
I love you, and I respect you. You know that.
but right now you're way out of bounds.
I'm not involved.
the team is here working on a case, and you're with her.
you're involved.
for your information, she lost it back at the station, so I drove her home.
end of story. - But not for her.
Derek, she's so sad and so confused and angry and desperately looking for anyone to swoop in and make it all better, and unless you're all in and can be there for every stage of the grieving process, you're just another reason for her to not trust the world.
she's simply trying to understand why this happened.
there is no why, and she'll make herself crazy trying to find one.
don't tell me.
bar in southeast, 2 dead. They're waiting for you.
I got to go. - Yeah.
what are you doing here?
detective, we can argue about this later.
right now you have a crime scene and we're here to help.
they nailed the bartender's hands to the bar first.
other bastard got off easier.
they just plain beat him.
I'm getting real sick of us being right and it just not mattering.
this is weird. - What?
the unsubs are extremely physical.
they beat their victims mercilessly with blunt objects.
why aren't these nails pounded in?
probably used a nail gun.
with all the gentrification and turnover in housing in the neighborhood, what's a common sight these days?
builders, contractors, and construction workers.
we wouldn't give it a second thought.
wait a minute.
killing 4 people in that first home invasion-- that never made sense to me.
unsubs build to something like that.
what if this wasn't their first murder?
the first two rounds of vandalism, they were typical.
car windows smashed, restaurants with the plate glass broken.
but that last case, right before the home invasion, that was a random construction site.
a single-family townhouse.
Prentiss, you flagged it yourself. - Yeah, yeah.
Hey, garcia.
I need the address on that townhouse that was vandalized.
I don't understand how we can help.
sir, we believe that whoever vandalized your house is responsible for the murders in the area.
Oh, i know. We've read the papers.
but, honestly, that's not something we're gonna think about right now.
we also think it's possible that your home was vandalized for a reason.
what do you mean?
may we?
Yes, please. - Thank you.
we believe there may have been another murder before the first one the police became aware of.
you think there might be a body hidden here, on our property?
it's possible. At the very least, the men we're looking for may have worked here.
Oh, my god.
were there any issues with workers during construction?
no, nothing. - Did anyone appear overly confrontational?
I just had contact with our contractor, and he was friendly.
I understand people come and go during construction, but was there anyone at all that you may have noticed suddenly wasn't around?
Oh, no. - What is it?
the contractor I mentioned...
after the vandalism, we called him to oversee the repairs.
he never called us back.
the police report said that every room in the house was destroyed except one.
Yeah, they smashed every room except the nursery. That one they didn't touch.
we need to see it.
this wall is structural.
I wouldn't ask you this unless I felt it was incredibly important.
I need to open up this wall. - No.
we can't live here and not know.
ma'am, I promise you, even if I have to do every bit of the work myself, this wall will be repaired and it'll go right back to being exactly what you want.
please? - Ok.
this is agent emily prentiss with the fbi.
I need an scsi unit.
we've got a body.
I can't be here.
let's move over here.
is there someplace the two of you can stay?
Yes. We have friends I can call.
after you give the police a statement, they can take you to your friends' house.
thank you.
you think they'll be ok?
I don't know. I mean, you redo your dream home, about to start a new chapter of your life, and then this?
how did you know?
the other crime scenes were brutal. But it also had control.
they took their time, that type of m. o.had to start before the home invasions.
this entire place was destroyed except this room. Why?
because they took the time to rebuild the wall once they buried the contractor.
exactly.
if they smashed this place up, he could have been discovered.
but still, a body inside the wall?
it's like a builders tradition.
you leave a little something behind to send a message to the people who may do work down the road.
front page of a newspaper.
a photo of the construction crew.
it's like a time capsule. - Ok.
OK, so what would you need to rebuild this wall?
drywall, brickwork, electrical?
I'm gonna call garcia.
Hey, girl.
are we good? - Yeah, we're good.
OK. What do you need?
OK, pull up the address of the townhouse that was vandalized. - Got it.
OK. Give me work permits for the contractor.
that would be... James morris. Is he our unsub?
no, actually, i'm afraid he's our first victim.
does it list morris' subcontractors? - Yes, it does.
all right, i need all the names and addresses for whoever was hired to do the electrical, brickwork, and drywall.
that would be 3 names, one address.
so they do live together. - Yeah.
5058 b street near anacostia, particulars coming to you... Now.
Thanks, babe.
we were right. They're a pack.
we go in first. - It's your case.
police! - Fbi!
get him down!
where are the other two?
you gotta be kidding me, right? - Dave.
you like that, sir?
I got more.
where are the others?
go to hell.
Garcia, i need vehicle information on all the residents.
get him up.
got it.
Apb--station wagon, d. c.plate 7-4-delta-alpha-4.
I also need to know if they're registered on any jobs right now.
I got a visual on the station wagon just south of 8th, heading toward half street, southeast.
that's right next to their current work site.
you know what gets me?
see, we figured you were down and out, pissed off.
but you're out here working.
what is so god-awful about your life that you gotta take it out on the rest of the world?
it was fun, boss.
deploy tactical units 922 half street, southeast. - Thanks.
we got 'em.
forget him, morgan. He's nothing. - Let's go.
how many we got?
25, maybe 30.
that ought to do it.
I got snipers up high, I got a team around back.
once we're sure there's not a hostage inside, i'll give the order to breach.
you leaving?
you've got this under control.
is he just gonna walk away?
looks like it.
just when I thought he was back on top of his game.
you got at least 2 dozen cops, all looking for revenge.
you got two psychopaths inside, ready to play out their fantasy end.
you want to take your shot... Take it.
our job is done.
is it time? - What the hell, right?
just keep your head up and you hold this son of a bitch out front like it's a gun.
gun!
william shakespeare wrote, "these violent delights have violent ends.
I just wanted to come by and let you know that it was over.
we got 'em.
Ooh, it hurts!
please... Help me.
Oh, my god! Stop!
take me to a hospital.
stop! Oh, my god, stop!
is everything ok?
Oh, god.
Hey, you. How you doing?
give me the baby. - Wait.
it's a girl. - Don't! No! Let me just
give me back my baby!
what's next?
Baton rouge thinks they have a white supremacist problem.
what's your take? - Really?
Yeah, i'd like to hear it.
we're dealing with an individual, not a group. - Why?
the angry letters.
the writer switches pronouns from plural to singular.
"we are a heavily armed militia,"
good. Send it back to the police with our analysis. What else?
you need to be somewhere?
Henry's just going through a clingy stage.
it's one less 3 a.m.diaper change when i put him down.
why don't you go home?
Oh, no, no, no. We only have 5 more cases. We can crank 'em out.
we can do this tomorrow. Please go home.
OK. Thank you.
I just have one last distribution and i'm out of here.
good night. - Good night.
close the door.
