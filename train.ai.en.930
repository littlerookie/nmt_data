you can't do much more than turn the lights off and on without the component thing.
we have to do something.
wait a second.
these suits were designed to protect the wearer from harsh environments, right?
technically, yes.
then I have a really terrible idea.
Oh, no, no.
you're not thinking what I think you're thinking.
the radiation in there would be pretty extreme.
not to mention those electrical discharges look pretty unfriendly, but yeah, but the antenna has a control crystal.
if we could pull it manually it's 50-50 we even get that far.
I'd go 30-70, but I don't have a better idea, and the suits, they should protect us.
we disabled the ship weapons.
you did?
ronon did, yeah.
they didn't have any other choice.
ramming the facility with the ship is the only sure-fire way to take it out.
killing all of us in the process.
I don't think he's that worried about us.
they just depressurized the 302 bay.
you ready?
let's just get this over with.
you know we both don't have to go in there.
well, when you get killed by one of those discharges, someone's going to have to finish the job, so oh, great pep talk.
Thanks.
I'm pretty sure we want to avoid those touching us.
Thanks, coach.
what are you waiting for?
I have to pull the right one or the antenna explodes.
hurry up.
but get it right.
how long before the daedalus hits the surface?
a minute, tops.
how many people on board?
couple hundred.
look, I've got an idea, but you'll have to trust me.
all right.
I need you to open up the hyperdrive in 30 seconds.
we're going to have to make a short jump -Impossible -Not a problem.
you can do this, Marks.
we're all counting on you.
I've almost got it.
we're entering the atmosphere. Okay.
here goes nothing.
what just happened?
you're welcome.
what did you do?
I just opened up a hyperspace window big enough for the both of us.
we just traveled through the planet.
I got it.
I'm back in.
we've got control of the ship.
and not a moment too late.
they found us again.
give them everything you've got!
okay.
you're okay, you're okay.
wrong again.
did you turn it off?
I did-- we did-- you did.
look, where does it hurt?
everywhere.
I don't suppose there's a hospital nearby.
I'm-- I'm pretty sure we're on our own.
good.
look, on the bright side, we'll both be dead of dehydration in, like, five days.
so you won't have to put up with me for much longer.
I'm, uh, I'm pretty busted up, Rodney.
I don't, I don't think I'm going to make it that long.
okay. I know it may not seem like it, but I want you to know I really res...
Oh, thank god.
I sure am glad to see you two.
he's badly hurt.
that's a new look for you.
well, you know me, it's function over fashion.
is the device still active?
not without this.
it's the facility's main control crystal.
that's not good enough for me.
Colonel Sheppard, we have drs Mckay and jackson.
our weapons are not operational.
can you please see to it that we never have to deal with the attero device again?
I'm locked on to its coordinates.
opening fire.
leveled.
good.
let's go home.
well, you want to unzip me?
I'll look for a can opener Zelenka has been a big help with ship repairs.
we should have her ready to fly in no time.
then what.
start a new settlement, I guess.
that's good to hear.
you tell Larrin I'll help you with whatever you need.
thank you.
we'll be in touch.
yeah I'm sure you will be.
tell Larrin she doesn't need to wait for the next galactic emergency to drop by.
I'm a lot more charming when my friends aren't about to die.
that's not what Larrin said.
see, she does talk about me.
every now and again.
what does she say?
what, not even a hint.
you all done for the day?
uh, dr. Cole's taking my shift. Yeah.
want to get something to eat?
listen, um, I'm really glad you came on the mission.
I mean, without you there, we'D probably all be dead.
but,
I just want to be clear, because, um...
I just want you to know, that, uh, I'm kind of interested in somebody else.
so?
I just didn't want to give you the wrong...
didn't I just, um, wanted to get something to eat.
okay, because I thought-- Yeah, well, you're wrong.
okay.
okay.
do you still want to go-- uh, no.
I should probably...
I should go.
how are you?
well, it hurts to eat this fruit cup.
don't eat the fruit cup, then.
thank you, Groucho.
listen, not that I don't appreciate the visits, but shouldn't you be trying to figure out a way to keep the asgards out of the shield again?
one step ahead of you.
that won't happen again.
good.
you don't think they'd make a run at us again?
well, I'm not sure, but we did ruin the one plan they had to feel free in this galaxy They might hold a grudge.
well, let's hope not.
Yeah, I heard they're sending you back to earth.
Yeah, I guess I need some major patching up and recovery.
Landry prefers I do that there instead of here, so the daedalus has already picked up a gate left over from the old gate bridge and my team is installing it as we speak so we should have you home in no time.
that's good.
that is good.
yes So well, it's been --unique --Yes, it has.
it sure has.
but I do want to say thank you for...
saying that you respected me when you thought I was about to die back there.
excuse me I said no such thing.
Yeah, you did You were, like...
I know it may not seem like it, but I really respect you, and that means a great deal to me.
I don't believe I ever finished that sentence.
how else would you have finished that sentence?
I would have said "regret."
I would have said I really regret you being here because none of this would have happened otherwise.
so you can only give compliments to the dying?
it's something I'm working on.
do you want to try any of this.
Ooh, fries.
Yeah,yeah Dive right in,take the-- take the deal there.
you're both familiar with the ancient named janus.
the inventor.
I have information that could lead us to his secret lab.
we were attacked.
by who.
I was hoping you could tell me.
get the device operational within one hour or I will kill him.
do you understand?
somehow, you've found the attero device.
what.
we're locked in?
wait, there's a very dangerous, serious problem with the device, and we need to talk to your boss.
if the power continues to build like this, the gate will reach critical overload and most certainly explode.
everyone that doesn't need to be here, get to the edge of the city.
it's not enough.
move quickly.
we have to get everyone to the lower levels of the tower to make sure that everyone will be
Colonel sheppard, are you all right?
how many were up there?
two
I'll go get my people.
they were right here when I left them.
if the explosion was hot enough, there might not be anything left for us to find.
did you hear that?
we didn't take cover.
are you all right?
are you all right?
my ears.
I think I've got a some glass in my back we lost the stargate, we lost the control room That's bad.
but we did not lose you.
that's good.
okay.
all the troops you've requested have beamed onboard.
have them round up the rest of the humans and confine them to one of the hangar bays.
inform our hive to wait for us here, and under no circumstances are they to activate their hyperdrive
is that understood?
Yes.
I need you to get banks and her team to set up an auxiliary control room below the damaged areas.
they've already begun.
how are you?
I'm alive.
you know, that's good for now.
I still do not understand what happened.
the gate blew up.
that much I surmised.
but why?
I don't know.
where the hell's mckay when you need him, huh?
all right.
so the device creates a very specific subspace "turbulence"that makes it impossible.
for the wraith to operate their hyperdrives.
you said that already.
but there's a side effect.
the "unforeseen" one that janus mentions.
Yeah, well, it's certainly not seen here because there's no stargate on this planet.
what's the point, Rodney.
although the subspace turbulence only affects the wraith's hyperdrive systems.
it creates a very dangerous type of radiation that.
well the messes with the basic operation of the stargates.
stargates.
what, as in all of them?
all of the stargates in the pegasus network, yes.
and when you say "messes with," you mean what?
look, when dialed, power will build up inside the gate until it overloads.
so you're saying that as long as this janus device is running.
every time someone dials a gate in the entire galaxy-- it'll explode.
millions of people will die if we don't shut that thing down.
good timing, Mr Woolsey.
look.
I don't know what it is you think we've done, but I assure you.
take us out of hyperspace.
we haven't arrived at atlantis yet.
we're within communications range.
we don't want to get too close.
I was hoping you'd be awake for this.
well, are we up and running.
Yes, sir We've routed .all the city's main controls into this room
at least we're not blind anymore.
no, but we're severely crippled.
without the gate or the ability to reach the daedalus.
we have no way of getting to m6h-987 or rescuing rodney and Dr Jackson.
what should we do 5 bucks to anyone who figures out how to contact daedalus.
Colonel sheppard.
you got an idea, banks.
well, no, but I am being hailed by the daedalus on subspace.
does that count.
technically that's not your idea, but good enough Put 'em on screen.
I'll pay you later.
Daedalus, it's good to, uh-- colonel sheppard.
what the hell's going on?
Where's Caldwell?
I'm afraid I had to relieve him and his crew of duty [Whispering]: How close are they?
not close enough to go by jumper.
don't worry, I'm more than willing to return this ship and its crew to you.
in exchange for what?
you've activated the attero device.
I need you to shut it down and give me its location immediately.
I don't know what you're talking about.
it was very clever of you, luring me and my ship out into the open so you could see for yourself if it worked.
if what worked.
I have to admit, in a way I'm impressed.
I was there 10, 000 years ago when the ancients first tried to use it.
but they didn't have the stomach to leave it on once they realized how.
many of their precious stargates it would destroy and how many humans it would kill.
sounds like something janus would have worked on.
give me the location of the attero device, and once I have destroyed it, I will return this crew to .
look, it's not what you think ee have nothing to do with this.
every minute that goes by without you telling me where this device is, I will kill a member of your expedition.
your time starts now.
give us a second.
I don't think this should count toward the minute.
I-- I mean, he didn't say no yet.
what are the odds that-- what's this thing called?
uh, attero device.
what are the odds that this thing was at the other end of the subspace link that rodney opened when he went to that lab?
m6h-987 Very likely
it's also very likely that's where he and Dr Jackson were taken.
it must be a weapon that janus developed during the wraith war.
a weapon to blow up stargates.
I doubt that was its original design.
it doesn't seem like an effective strategy.
so, a nasty side effect.
that's probably why they stopped production.
whatever the aliens took from the lab allowed them to reactivate it again.
whatever it is, todd seems pretty keen to stop it, enough to risk taking the daedalus.
Yes, but we can't give him the address.
if he gets it, he'll destroy everything in his path, including rodney and Dr Jackson.
John, we don't have a choice.
our shield was able to take the brunt of the explosion, but if this is happening on other worlds
it could kill millions.
put 'em back on.
Oh, thank god.
we're not the ones behind this.
very well.
w-w-wait.
I said, we're not the ones behind this, but we may have what you need.
Atlantis was attacked yesterday, by a race we have not encountered before.
they stole a piece of ancient technology.
we believe this could be a component to this attero device.
we managed to track them.
you swing by here, pick me up, I will take you there myself.
and give you the chance to take out my hyperdrive with one of your drones I think not.
why would I do that?
right now, you're one of the few people in the galaxy with a ship capable of dealing with this problem.
and I intend to keep it that way.
John sheppard, transmit the coordinates or I will feed on Mr Woolsey before your eyes.
do it.
we have it.
we'll be in touch.
you really think that's going to work.
you got a better idea.
we're on a space ship.
those doors are designed to be airtight.
that means something as tiny as air can't even get through.
how do you think you will?
Yeah, well, I'm a lot bigger than air.
yeah that's kind of my point.
see.
you okay?
Yeah.
all right Come on.
wait What's our plan Where are we going.
get to an access ladder, head down two floors to the engineering rooms.
then we cripple the ship.
you know how to do all that.
yeah Don't you?
not really.
watch and learn.
hyperspace window opening.
think Todd changed his mind.
he might have realized just how crippled we are.
we're being hailed.
put it up.
my name is Katana Labrea.
I'm a traveler.
Larrin sent me.
well, is everything all right.
no, as a matter of fact, it's not.
Larrin was hoping you could tell us why the stargates are blowing up?
cici you Come with me.
me Why?
we'll both go no need for that.
no.
I guess it just must be your turn to use the fitness room.
all right.
good luck.
you too.
it was the first colony we'd built on the surface of a planet in a hundred generations and it was leveled in an instant.
I was in orbit when it happened.
we could see the explosion from space.
I've never witnessed anything that powerful.
the gates are made of naquadah.
when they become unstable, the size of the explosion is unimaginable.
we lost 3, 000 people and two ships, including our ancient vessel.
Larrin would have come herself, but-- no, I'm sure she's got her hands full.
look, these aliens or whoever they are, they have two of our people hostage.
they need to be stopped.
we have coordinates, but we have no ship.
then I guess I got here just in time.
that's what I wanted to hear.
Zelenka, you're with me.
John --Teyla, I need you to stay here, all right
the second Todd's done, there's nothing stopping him from turning that ship around and making a run at Atlantis.
I need somebody I can trust to stay in charge here.
good luck.
I locked the door.
this won't take long.
so what do we do.
bring up the main control systems and disable them one by one.
that's one way to go.
well, you'd have to lock them out of the mainframe, though.
otherwise they could just turn them back on again
do you have some sort of a passcode to make sure they're locked out once and for all?
Nope.
well, then, what are you thinking.
we just dropped out of hyperspace.
I see that, yes.
Why?
I'm not sure.
the computer seems to think it's due to battle damage.
get our troops down to the engineering room.
someone's sabotaging this ship.
wh-- what are you doing?
disabling the ship.
you can't just blast away at vital systems like that
what if you take out the life support system.
don't worry The life support system is that tray.
at least, I'm pretty sure it is.
okay, we're out of hyperspace That's enough Come on.
you wish to speak to me.
you're the leader.
you need to shut this device down immediately.
no, I do not.
okay, look, I understand wanting to destroy the wraith I do.
but this isn't the way.
I disagree.
okay, I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but this device has a serious side effect.
it makes stargates explode when they're activated.
we do not use the stargates.
okay.
but lots of other people do.
they are of no concern to us.
so you're just going to let them die, millions of people, across the galaxy.
you're no better than the wraith.
perhaps. But we have little choice.
Why?
our planet is dying.
it can no longer sustain us.
for the first time in countless generations, we must venture out into this galaxy again, a galaxy controlled by the wraith.
if we do not destroy them, they will destroy us.
this is the way it must be.
the wraith are ahead of us.
as soon as they get to that planet, they'll open up with everything they've got.
trust me, they ain't going to be worried about collateral damage.
the only chance we have to save our friends is to get there first.
you want speed.
you've come to the right place.
this is your engineering room.
that's right.
it may not look like much, but trust me, we can outrun most anything in the traveler fleet.
this is colonel sheppard and dr Zelenka.
they're from Atlantis.
mila's our chief engineer.
she can't be more than 16 years old 15, actually.
she's been working on ships since she was four.
we need to get where we're going as fast as possible.
I want you to do whatever you can to maximize hyperdrive output.
no problem.
you know, uh, Zelenka knows a thing or two about hyperdrives himself.
I'm sure he'd be happy to give you a hand.
who knows, maybe you'll learn a thing or two
the damage is significant.
begin repairs.
every second the attero device is active, we risk losing more and more of our alliance.
it has come to my attention that someone from the original crew has eluded capture.
your freedom has become a nuisance.
turn yourself in immediately or we will begin killing off your friends one by one.
you have three minutes to comply.
he's bluffing.
no, he's not.
where are you going.
I'm turning myself in.
no, you're not.
he's going to start killing people.
he's going to kill you.
well, I hope not.
we need to get armed, free these people, and take this ship back.
exactly I turn myself in, and he'll think he's got us all.
it buys you the time you need to do what you've got to do.
no.
no, I'm not letting you do it.
Ronon, listen to me-- Jennifer, no.
okay.
you're right.
okay.
come on.
we're almost there anyways.
we're talking about the deaths of millions of people.
how can you be so callous.
and what is it you're so afraid of.
why-- why are you still in your battle armor?
I can't hurt you.
I know you're not human.
you're definitely not wraith.
and if you were an ancient, you wouldn't have needed our help to activate the device so...
what are you?
you're asgard.
you've encountered our kind before.
no, not just encountered.
I've worked with them, even called a few of them my friends.
indeed.
of course, the asgard I knew were a noble race who actually helped the human population in my galaxy.
and where are they now?
dead.
but that had nothing to do with us.
are you certain?
they were clones-- copies of copies of copies, going back generations, and they suffered irreversible genetic degradation as a result.
but you probably already know that.
of course, because we are clones as well, subject to the same law of diminishing returns.
and yet, we are still very much alive.
so, what, you solved the problem?
not entirely.
but once we were able to conduct our research without interference, we made significant progress.
research on humans because our physiology is similar to what yours used to be.
precisely.
I take that back.
I have met an asgard like you before.
his name was Loki, and he was experimenting on humans too, until he was caught and brought to justice by the asgard high council.
because they did not believe the ends justified the means.
that's right.
and look where it got them.
well, how's it coming? It does that sometimes.
don't let it bother you.
listen, what we are doing here is not safe.
what else is new.
she is pushing this ship well past its boundaries.
that's kind of what we asked for, no.
if we don't get Rodney and Danny back before Todd gets there, they're goners.
this is the crudest hyperdrive system I've ever encountered.
it is cobbled together from mismatching components.
she's got to be pretty smart to put a hyperdrive together with mismatched parts.
she's going to burn it up.
once out of hyperspace, there's a high possibility we won't be able to engage the drive again.
let's worry about that when we get there.
what was that.
just a radiation warning.
the detector's a little over-sensitive.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I've got to get back to the bridge.
I'll leave you to it.
we came to this galaxy during the war.
with both the wraith and the ancients occupied, we were free to conduct our experiments.
unfortunately, the hostilities came to an end sooner than we thought, and with an unexpected result.
you were betting on the ancients.
they may have tried to shut you down, but at least they wouldn't exterminate you.
the wraith do not tolerate the presence of advanced technologies other than their own.
before we knew what was happening, we were under attack.
we lost our intergalactic ships in the first battle, and we did not have the resources to build more.
so how did you survive?
we had no choice but to abandon our settlements and retreat to a place where the wraith could not look for us.
a planet with a toxic atmosphere.
that sounds nice.
it was tolerable at first.
we were able to survive using simple breathing apparatus.
but over the eons, the environment has grown so harsh that not even our armored exoskeletons can protect us now.
so you ventured back into the galaxy, and that's when you came across this place.
we knew it was built by the ancients, and why, but we were unable to activate it until you came along.
look, I-- I'm sorry that you were trapped on a poisonous planet for the last 10, 000 years.
I really am.
I'm sure it was awful.
but that doesn't justify what you're doing.
my people are dying.
the fact that, as you tell us, our brothers are already gone, only reinforces the need.
if we do not do this, our whole civilization, a hundred thousand years of history, will be wiped out forever.
I cannot allow that to happen.
Dr. Keller You're the saboteur.
that's right.
Where's your weapon?
my weapon.
yes The one you used to destroy the crystal trays.
I ditched it.
you really think I'd want it ending up in your hands.
Oh, it's foolish of you to see me as the enemy.
really. Why's that?
I'm on a mission from your colonel sheppard.
I seriously doubt that.
it is a long story, but he has requested that we neutralize a very dangerous target.
then why did you take over the ship.
why did you attack our crew.
as I said, it is a long story.
the mission, however, is time-sensitive, and you have handed us a major setback.
hyperdrive, weapons, shields-- they are all down.
that's a real shame.
it is considering that hundreds of thousands of humans could die because of it.
I would think that will weigh heavily on you in the future.
what are you talking about?
hyperdrive's coming back up.
and weapons.
irreparably damaged.
they're no good to us anymore.
I guess you won't be able to finish the mission, then.
Oh, we'll find a way.
get us back into hyperspace and get her down with the others.
you okay?
I thought you were a goner.
I'm all right.
I mean, they need me.
you're kind of expendable.
I just figured-- yeah, I got what you meant by "goner."
what did they want?
uh, to talk, actually.
how did that go?
they're asgard.
for real?
Yeah, a faction that broke off from the guys we knew thousands of years ago.
they're the ones inside the suits.
I did not see that one coming.
apparently no fans of the wraith, either.
are they going to shut off the device.
um, no.
then I don't care.
as long as that thing is on, then millions of people could die.
besides, I think I've figured a way out of here.
Really?
this is an ancient facility, and rodney mckay knows a thing or two about ancient facilities.
it has been clinically proven-- referring to yourself in the third person is a sign of mental instability.
mentally unstable like a fox.
okay, so, here's the plan.
I blow the fire-monitoring fuse.
the system suddenly goes dead, it assumes there could be a fire, detects lifesigns inside the room.
it unlocks the doors for safety.
good job.
good thing they brought you back when they did, because I assumed you were dead and I was going to leave.
lucky me.
so, what do we do now?
we've got to shut down the device.
how do we do that?
we'll just we'll improvise.
right.
Todd didn't kill you?
no, but you almost got me killed.
I've never fired one of these outside of the range before.
you did great.
good work.
it's not over yet.
there's an armory down the hall.
we need everyone we can.
we're taking this ship back.
we need to create a diversion.
I'm alears.
okay, uh, we go to the power relay station, we create a massive explosion.
I never got how that made a good diversion.
what?
you want to clear the device control room of bad guys, right?
Yes.
why assume if there was a massive explosion people would run towards it?
I would.
I rest my case.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a good person.
I'd want to save people from the fire, maybe figure out what was going on.
I'd order more guards to protect the one room I thought whoever is blowing things up probably wants to get to.
explosion diversions are the very cornerstone of diversions.
you don't have any better ideas.
I don't have any better ideas, yes.
Oh, my god.
please don't kill me.
you need me.
Rodney. - Us, us.
you need us.
the device needs constant care.
true, I'm the only one who knows how to work it-- what am I talking about killing for.
you're not a violent race.
you may have stunned us-- rodney.
more than we'd have liked, but-- they're just suits.
suits that house one of the smartest races ever.
I've always been a big fan of the asgards.
some of my best friends are asgards-- they're empty suits.
see.
yeah I know I was...
you were?
Yeah, it's not important.
from what I could tell, the inside of the suits form around whoever's in them.
one size fits all.
you sure you have all that figured out?
I've flown birds a lot harder to manage than this one.
I'm surprised larrin didn't say anything.
Larrin's never brought you up before today.
really never?
Nope.
we're about to come out of hyperspace.
everyone, get ready.
see, I knew this would happen.
we burned it out.
we got here, though, didn't we?
any sign of the daedalus?
no.
looks like we beat them.
that's the first good news I've had all day.
wait, I've got two ships closing in.
shields up.
fire at will.
evasive maneuvers might be good.
I'm on it.
clear.
how come we haven't run into any of them yet?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
do a lifesigns scan, find out where they are.
I have a mass of lifesigns in the second 302 bay.
they fell back to their ship.
it's still in the bay.
why would they do that? They saw we'd armed up.
didn't want to risk a fight?
that doesn't sound like Todd.
I'm going to check it out.
take us out of hyperspace.
what is it?
they locked us out of flight controls.
can you get us back in?
not quickly.
what's he got planned?
okay, how long to get the device shut down?
five minutes.
all right, look.
you watch the-- oh, come on.
what?
what now?
well, something must have spooked them.
Why?
well, aside from encrypting the access to this workstation yeah, but you can break that.
Yeah, in a heartbeat, but, as they very well know, you can't operate this machine without the control key.
look-- the thing they stole from janus' lab to begin with.
they've taken it.
one down, one to go.
I'm picking up a third ship headed right for us.
wonderful.
that was close.
it flew into hyperspace.
what?
hold on, I've got another window opening.
they're coming right back at us.
what kind of messed-up battle technique is that?
it's quite a bit out, nowhere near the planet yet.
wait it's the Daedalus.
contact them.
we're going to need the help.
Colonel Sheppard.
surprised to see all of you guys.
same here.
look, I'm on a travelers-- I'm on a travelers ship.
we've engaged the enemy.
have you gotten the Daedalus back?
because we're going to need the help.
Todd let us take her back without so much as a fight.
but he's locked us out of the controls and retreated to one of the 302 bays.
why the hell would he do that?
he needs that place destroyed more than anyone.
Mr. Woolsey, sir.
what is it, Marks?
sir, the second we came out of hyperspace, a pre-programmed sub-routine kicked in.
meaning our main scanners located a facility on the planet and immediately locked the guidance system into it.
it's taking us to the attero device.
in a way sir, it's programmed a collision course.
that's how he's going to destroy the facility, by ramming us into it.
can't we just power down the entire facility?
you can't do much more than turn the lights off and on without the component thing.
we have to do something.
wait a second.
these suits were designed to protect the wearer from harsh environments, right?
technically, yes.
then I have a really terrible idea.
Oh, no, no.
you're not thinking what I think you're thinking.
the radiation in there would be pretty extreme.
not to mention those electrical discharges look pretty unfriendly, but yeah, but the antenna has a control crystal.
if we could pull it manually it's 50-50 we even get that far.
I'd go 30-70, but I don't have a better idea, and the suits, they should protect us.
we disabled the ship weapons.
you did?
ronon did, yeah.
they didn't have any other choice.
ramming the facility with the ship is the only sure-fire way to take it out.
killing all of us in the process.
I don't think he's that worried about us.
they just depressurized the 302 bay.
you ready?
let's just get this over with.
you know we both don't have to go in there.
well, when you get killed by one of those discharges, someone's going to have to finish the job, so oh, great pep talk.
Thanks.
I'm pretty sure we want to avoid those touching us.
Thanks, coach.
what are you waiting for?
I have to pull the right one or the antenna explodes.
hurry up.
but get it right.
how long before the daedalus hits the surface?
a minute, tops.
how many people on board?
couple hundred.
look, I've got an idea, but you'll have to trust me.
all right.
I need you to open up the hyperdrive in 30 seconds.
we're going to have to make a short jump -Impossible -Not a problem.
you can do this, Marks.
we're all counting on you.
I've almost got it.
we're entering the atmosphere. Okay.
here goes nothing.
what just happened?
you're welcome.
what did you do?
I just opened up a hyperspace window big enough for the both of us.
we just traveled through the planet.
I got it.
I'm back in.
we've got control of the ship.
and not a moment too late.
they found us again.
give them everything you've got!
okay.
you're okay, you're okay.
wrong again.
did you turn it off?
I did-- we did-- you did.
look, where does it hurt?
everywhere.
I don't suppose there's a hospital nearby.
I'm-- I'm pretty sure we're on our own.
good.
look, on the bright side, we'll both be dead of dehydration in, like, five days.
so you won't have to put up with me for much longer.
I'm, uh, I'm pretty busted up, Rodney.
I don't, I don't think I'm going to make it that long.
okay. I know it may not seem like it, but I want you to know I really res...
Oh, thank god.
I sure am glad to see you two.
he's badly hurt.
that's a new look for you.
well, you know me, it's function over fashion.
is the device still active?
not without this.
it's the facility's main control crystal.
that's not good enough for me.
Colonel Sheppard, we have drs Mckay and jackson.
our weapons are not operational.
can you please see to it that we never have to deal with the attero device again?
I'm locked on to its coordinates.
opening fire.
leveled.
good.
let's go home.
well, you want to unzip me?
I'll look for a can opener Zelenka has been a big help with ship repairs.
we should have her ready to fly in no time.
then what.
start a new settlement, I guess.
that's good to hear.
you tell Larrin I'll help you with whatever you need.
thank you.
we'll be in touch.
yeah I'm sure you will be.
tell Larrin she doesn't need to wait for the next galactic emergency to drop by.
I'm a lot more charming when my friends aren't about to die.
that's not what Larrin said.
see, she does talk about me.
every now and again.
what does she say?
what, not even a hint.
you all done for the day?
uh, dr. Cole's taking my shift. Yeah.
want to get something to eat?
listen, um, I'm really glad you came on the mission.
I mean, without you there, we'D probably all be dead.
but,
I just want to be clear, because, um...
I just want you to know, that, uh, I'm kind of interested in somebody else.
so?
I just didn't want to give you the wrong...
didn't I just, um, wanted to get something to eat.
okay, because I thought-- Yeah, well, you're wrong.
okay.
okay.
do you still want to go-- uh, no.
I should probably...
I should go.
how are you?
well, it hurts to eat this fruit cup.
don't eat the fruit cup, then.
thank you, Groucho.
listen, not that I don't appreciate the visits, but shouldn't you be trying to figure out a way to keep the asgards out of the shield again?
one step ahead of you.
that won't happen again.
good.
you don't think they'd make a run at us again?
well, I'm not sure, but we did ruin the one plan they had to feel free in this galaxy They might hold a grudge.
well, let's hope not.
Yeah, I heard they're sending you back to earth.
Yeah, I guess I need some major patching up and recovery.
Landry prefers I do that there instead of here, so the daedalus has already picked up a gate left over from the old gate bridge and my team is installing it as we speak so we should have you home in no time.
that's good.
that is good.
yes So well, it's been --unique --Yes, it has.
it sure has.
but I do want to say thank you for...
saying that you respected me when you thought I was about to die back there.
excuse me I said no such thing.
Yeah, you did You were, like...
I know it may not seem like it, but I really respect you, and that means a great deal to me.
I don't believe I ever finished that sentence.
how else would you have finished that sentence?
I would have said "regret."
I would have said I really regret you being here because none of this would have happened otherwise.
so you can only give compliments to the dying?
it's something I'm working on.
do you want to try any of this.
Ooh, fries.
Yeah,yeah Dive right in,take the-- take the deal there.
you're both familiar with the ancient named janus.
the inventor.
I have information that could lead us to his secret lab.
we were attacked.
by who.
I was hoping you could tell me.
get the device operational within one hour or I will kill him.
do you understand?
somehow, you've found the attero device.
what.
we're locked in?
wait, there's a very dangerous, serious problem with the device, and we need to talk to your boss.
if the power continues to build like this, the gate will reach critical overload and most certainly explode.
everyone that doesn't need to be here, get to the edge of the city.
it's not enough.
move quickly.
we have to get everyone to the lower levels of the tower to make sure that everyone will be
Colonel sheppard, are you all right?
how many were up there?
two
I'll go get my people.
they were right here when I left them.
if the explosion was hot enough, there might not be anything left for us to find.
did you hear that?
we didn't take cover.
are you all right?
are you all right?
my ears.
I think I've got a some glass in my back we lost the stargate, we lost the control room That's bad.
but we did not lose you.
that's good.
okay.
all the troops you've requested have beamed onboard.
have them round up the rest of the humans and confine them to one of the hangar bays.
inform our hive to wait for us here, and under no circumstances are they to activate their hyperdrive
is that understood?
Yes.
I need you to get banks and her team to set up an auxiliary control room below the damaged areas.
they've already begun.
how are you?
I'm alive.
you know, that's good for now.
I still do not understand what happened.
the gate blew up.
that much I surmised.
but why?
I don't know.
where the hell's mckay when you need him, huh?
all right.
so the device creates a very specific subspace "turbulence"that makes it impossible.
for the wraith to operate their hyperdrives.
you said that already.
but there's a side effect.
the "unforeseen" one that janus mentions.
Yeah, well, it's certainly not seen here because there's no stargate on this planet.
what's the point, Rodney.
although the subspace turbulence only affects the wraith's hyperdrive systems.
it creates a very dangerous type of radiation that.
well the messes with the basic operation of the stargates.
stargates.
what, as in all of them?
all of the stargates in the pegasus network, yes.
and when you say "messes with," you mean what?
look, when dialed, power will build up inside the gate until it overloads.
so you're saying that as long as this janus device is running.
every time someone dials a gate in the entire galaxy-- it'll explode.
millions of people will die if we don't shut that thing down.
good timing, Mr Woolsey.
look.
I don't know what it is you think we've done, but I assure you.
take us out of hyperspace.
we haven't arrived at atlantis yet.
we're within communications range.
we don't want to get too close.
I was hoping you'd be awake for this.
well, are we up and running.
Yes, sir We've routed .all the city's main controls into this room
at least we're not blind anymore.
no, but we're severely crippled.
without the gate or the ability to reach the daedalus.
we have no way of getting to m6h-987 or rescuing rodney and Dr Jackson.
what should we do 5 bucks to anyone who figures out how to contact daedalus.
Colonel sheppard.
you got an idea, banks.
well, no, but I am being hailed by the daedalus on subspace.
does that count.
technically that's not your idea, but good enough Put 'em on screen.
I'll pay you later.
Daedalus, it's good to, uh-- colonel sheppard.
what the hell's going on?
Where's Caldwell?
I'm afraid I had to relieve him and his crew of duty [Whispering]: How close are they?
not close enough to go by jumper.
don't worry, I'm more than willing to return this ship and its crew to you.
in exchange for what?
you've activated the attero device.
I need you to shut it down and give me its location immediately.
I don't know what you're talking about.
it was very clever of you, luring me and my ship out into the open so you could see for yourself if it worked.
if what worked.
I have to admit, in a way I'm impressed.
I was there 10, 000 years ago when the ancients first tried to use it.
but they didn't have the stomach to leave it on once they realized how.
many of their precious stargates it would destroy and how many humans it would kill.
sounds like something janus would have worked on.
give me the location of the attero device, and once I have destroyed it, I will return this crew to .
look, it's not what you think ee have nothing to do with this.
every minute that goes by without you telling me where this device is, I will kill a member of your expedition.
your time starts now.
give us a second.
I don't think this should count toward the minute.
I-- I mean, he didn't say no yet.
what are the odds that-- what's this thing called?
uh, attero device.
what are the odds that this thing was at the other end of the subspace link that rodney opened when he went to that lab?
m6h-987 Very likely
it's also very likely that's where he and Dr Jackson were taken.
it must be a weapon that janus developed during the wraith war.
a weapon to blow up stargates.
I doubt that was its original design.
it doesn't seem like an effective strategy.
so, a nasty side effect.
that's probably why they stopped production.
whatever the aliens took from the lab allowed them to reactivate it again.
whatever it is, todd seems pretty keen to stop it, enough to risk taking the daedalus.
Yes, but we can't give him the address.
if he gets it, he'll destroy everything in his path, including rodney and Dr Jackson.
John, we don't have a choice.
our shield was able to take the brunt of the explosion, but if this is happening on other worlds
it could kill millions.
put 'em back on.
Oh, thank god.
we're not the ones behind this.
very well.
w-w-wait.
I said, we're not the ones behind this, but we may have what you need.
Atlantis was attacked yesterday, by a race we have not encountered before.
they stole a piece of ancient technology.
we believe this could be a component to this attero device.
we managed to track them.
you swing by here, pick me up, I will take you there myself.
and give you the chance to take out my hyperdrive with one of your drones I think not.
why would I do that?
right now, you're one of the few people in the galaxy with a ship capable of dealing with this problem.
and I intend to keep it that way.
John sheppard, transmit the coordinates or I will feed on Mr Woolsey before your eyes.
do it.
we have it.
we'll be in touch.
you really think that's going to work.
you got a better idea.
we're on a space ship.
those doors are designed to be airtight.
that means something as tiny as air can't even get through.
how do you think you will?
Yeah, well, I'm a lot bigger than air.
yeah that's kind of my point.
see.
you okay?
Yeah.
all right Come on.
wait What's our plan Where are we going.
get to an access ladder, head down two floors to the engineering rooms.
then we cripple the ship.
you know how to do all that.
yeah Don't you?
not really.
watch and learn.
hyperspace window opening.
think Todd changed his mind.
he might have realized just how crippled we are.
we're being hailed.
put it up.
my name is Katana Labrea.
I'm a traveler.
Larrin sent me.
well, is everything all right.
no, as a matter of fact, it's not.
Larrin was hoping you could tell us why the stargates are blowing up?
cici you Come with me.
me Why?
we'll both go no need for that.
no.
I guess it just must be your turn to use the fitness room.
all right.
good luck.
you too.
it was the first colony we'd built on the surface of a planet in a hundred generations and it was leveled in an instant.
I was in orbit when it happened.
we could see the explosion from space.
I've never witnessed anything that powerful.
the gates are made of naquadah.
when they become unstable, the size of the explosion is unimaginable.
we lost 3, 000 people and two ships, including our ancient vessel.
Larrin would have come herself, but-- no, I'm sure she's got her hands full.
look, these aliens or whoever they are, they have two of our people hostage.
they need to be stopped.
we have coordinates, but we have no ship.
then I guess I got here just in time.
that's what I wanted to hear.
Zelenka, you're with me.
John --Teyla, I need you to stay here, all right
the second Todd's done, there's nothing stopping him from turning that ship around and making a run at Atlantis.
I need somebody I can trust to stay in charge here.
good luck.
I locked the door.
this won't take long.
so what do we do.
bring up the main control systems and disable them one by one.
that's one way to go.
well, you'd have to lock them out of the mainframe, though.
otherwise they could just turn them back on again
do you have some sort of a passcode to make sure they're locked out once and for all?
Nope.
well, then, what are you thinking.
we just dropped out of hyperspace.
I see that, yes.
Why?
I'm not sure.
the computer seems to think it's due to battle damage.
get our troops down to the engineering room.
someone's sabotaging this ship.
wh-- what are you doing?
disabling the ship.
you can't just blast away at vital systems like that
what if you take out the life support system.
don't worry The life support system is that tray.
at least, I'm pretty sure it is.
okay, we're out of hyperspace That's enough Come on.
you wish to speak to me.
you're the leader.
you need to shut this device down immediately.
no, I do not.
okay, look, I understand wanting to destroy the wraith I do.
but this isn't the way.
I disagree.
okay, I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but this device has a serious side effect.
it makes stargates explode when they're activated.
we do not use the stargates.
okay.
but lots of other people do.
they are of no concern to us.
so you're just going to let them die, millions of people, across the galaxy.
you're no better than the wraith.
perhaps. But we have little choice.
Why?
our planet is dying.
it can no longer sustain us.
for the first time in countless generations, we must venture out into this galaxy again, a galaxy controlled by the wraith.
if we do not destroy them, they will destroy us.
this is the way it must be.
the wraith are ahead of us.
as soon as they get to that planet, they'll open up with everything they've got.
trust me, they ain't going to be worried about collateral damage.
the only chance we have to save our friends is to get there first.
you want speed.
you've come to the right place.
this is your engineering room.
that's right.
it may not look like much, but trust me, we can outrun most anything in the traveler fleet.
this is colonel sheppard and dr Zelenka.
they're from Atlantis.
mila's our chief engineer.
she can't be more than 16 years old 15, actually.
she's been working on ships since she was four.
we need to get where we're going as fast as possible.
I want you to do whatever you can to maximize hyperdrive output.
no problem.
you know, uh, Zelenka knows a thing or two about hyperdrives himself.
I'm sure he'd be happy to give you a hand.
who knows, maybe you'll learn a thing or two
the damage is significant.
begin repairs.
every second the attero device is active, we risk losing more and more of our alliance.
it has come to my attention that someone from the original crew has eluded capture.
your freedom has become a nuisance.
turn yourself in immediately or we will begin killing off your friends one by one.
you have three minutes to comply.
he's bluffing.
no, he's not.
where are you going.
I'm turning myself in.
no, you're not.
he's going to start killing people.
he's going to kill you.
well, I hope not.
we need to get armed, free these people, and take this ship back.
exactly I turn myself in, and he'll think he's got us all.
it buys you the time you need to do what you've got to do.
no.
no, I'm not letting you do it.
Ronon, listen to me-- Jennifer, no.
okay.
you're right.
okay.
come on.
we're almost there anyways.
we're talking about the deaths of millions of people.
how can you be so callous.
and what is it you're so afraid of.
why-- why are you still in your battle armor?
I can't hurt you.
I know you're not human.
you're definitely not wraith.
and if you were an ancient, you wouldn't have needed our help to activate the device so...
what are you?
you're asgard.
you've encountered our kind before.
no, not just encountered.
I've worked with them, even called a few of them my friends.
indeed.
of course, the asgard I knew were a noble race who actually helped the human population in my galaxy.
and where are they now?
dead.
but that had nothing to do with us.
are you certain?
they were clones-- copies of copies of copies, going back generations, and they suffered irreversible genetic degradation as a result.
but you probably already know that.
of course, because we are clones as well, subject to the same law of diminishing returns.
and yet, we are still very much alive.
so, what, you solved the problem?
not entirely.
but once we were able to conduct our research without interference, we made significant progress.
research on humans because our physiology is similar to what yours used to be.
precisely.
I take that back.
I have met an asgard like you before.
his name was Loki, and he was experimenting on humans too, until he was caught and brought to justice by the asgard high council.
because they did not believe the ends justified the means.
that's right.
and look where it got them.
well, how's it coming? It does that sometimes.
don't let it bother you.
listen, what we are doing here is not safe.
what else is new.
she is pushing this ship well past its boundaries.
that's kind of what we asked for, no.
if we don't get Rodney and Danny back before Todd gets there, they're goners.
this is the crudest hyperdrive system I've ever encountered.
it is cobbled together from mismatching components.
she's got to be pretty smart to put a hyperdrive together with mismatched parts.
she's going to burn it up.
once out of hyperspace, there's a high possibility we won't be able to engage the drive again.
let's worry about that when we get there.
what was that.
just a radiation warning.
the detector's a little over-sensitive.
I wouldn't worry about it.
I've got to get back to the bridge.
I'll leave you to it.
we came to this galaxy during the war.
with both the wraith and the ancients occupied, we were free to conduct our experiments.
unfortunately, the hostilities came to an end sooner than we thought, and with an unexpected result.
you were betting on the ancients.
they may have tried to shut you down, but at least they wouldn't exterminate you.
the wraith do not tolerate the presence of advanced technologies other than their own.
before we knew what was happening, we were under attack.
we lost our intergalactic ships in the first battle, and we did not have the resources to build more.
so how did you survive?
we had no choice but to abandon our settlements and retreat to a place where the wraith could not look for us.
a planet with a toxic atmosphere.
that sounds nice.
it was tolerable at first.
we were able to survive using simple breathing apparatus.
but over the eons, the environment has grown so harsh that not even our armored exoskeletons can protect us now.
so you ventured back into the galaxy, and that's when you came across this place.
we knew it was built by the ancients, and why, but we were unable to activate it until you came along.
look, I-- I'm sorry that you were trapped on a poisonous planet for the last 10, 000 years.
I really am.
I'm sure it was awful.
but that doesn't justify what you're doing.
my people are dying.
the fact that, as you tell us, our brothers are already gone, only reinforces the need.
if we do not do this, our whole civilization, a hundred thousand years of history, will be wiped out forever.
I cannot allow that to happen.
Dr. Keller You're the saboteur.
that's right.
Where's your weapon?
my weapon.
yes The one you used to destroy the crystal trays.
I ditched it.
you really think I'd want it ending up in your hands.
Oh, it's foolish of you to see me as the enemy.
really. Why's that?
I'm on a mission from your colonel sheppard.
I seriously doubt that.
it is a long story, but he has requested that we neutralize a very dangerous target.
then why did you take over the ship.
why did you attack our crew.
as I said, it is a long story.
the mission, however, is time-sensitive, and you have handed us a major setback.
hyperdrive, weapons, shields-- they are all down.
that's a real shame.
it is considering that hundreds of thousands of humans could die because of it.
I would think that will weigh heavily on you in the future.
what are you talking about?
hyperdrive's coming back up.
and weapons.
irreparably damaged.
they're no good to us anymore.
I guess you won't be able to finish the mission, then.
Oh, we'll find a way.
get us back into hyperspace and get her down with the others.
you okay?
I thought you were a goner.
I'm all right.
I mean, they need me.
you're kind of expendable.
I just figured-- yeah, I got what you meant by "goner."
what did they want?
uh, to talk, actually.
how did that go?
they're asgard.
for real?
Yeah, a faction that broke off from the guys we knew thousands of years ago.
they're the ones inside the suits.
I did not see that one coming.
apparently no fans of the wraith, either.
are they going to shut off the device.
um, no.
then I don't care.
as long as that thing is on, then millions of people could die.
besides, I think I've figured a way out of here.
Really?
this is an ancient facility, and rodney mckay knows a thing or two about ancient facilities.
it has been clinically proven-- referring to yourself in the third person is a sign of mental instability.
mentally unstable like a fox.
okay, so, here's the plan.
I blow the fire-monitoring fuse.
the system suddenly goes dead, it assumes there could be a fire, detects lifesigns inside the room.
it unlocks the doors for safety.
good job.
good thing they brought you back when they did, because I assumed you were dead and I was going to leave.
lucky me.
so, what do we do now?
we've got to shut down the device.
how do we do that?
we'll just we'll improvise.
right.
Todd didn't kill you?
no, but you almost got me killed.
I've never fired one of these outside of the range before.
you did great.
good work.
it's not over yet.
there's an armory down the hall.
we need everyone we can.
we're taking this ship back.
we need to create a diversion.
I'm alears.
okay, uh, we go to the power relay station, we create a massive explosion.
I never got how that made a good diversion.
what?
you want to clear the device control room of bad guys, right?
Yes.
why assume if there was a massive explosion people would run towards it?
I would.
I rest my case.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a good person.
I'd want to save people from the fire, maybe figure out what was going on.
I'd order more guards to protect the one room I thought whoever is blowing things up probably wants to get to.
explosion diversions are the very cornerstone of diversions.
you don't have any better ideas.
I don't have any better ideas, yes.
Oh, my god.
please don't kill me.
you need me.
Rodney. - Us, us.
you need us.
the device needs constant care.
true, I'm the only one who knows how to work it-- what am I talking about killing for.
you're not a violent race.
you may have stunned us-- rodney.
more than we'd have liked, but-- they're just suits.
suits that house one of the smartest races ever.
I've always been a big fan of the asgards.
some of my best friends are asgards-- they're empty suits.
see.
yeah I know I was...
you were?
Yeah, it's not important.
from what I could tell, the inside of the suits form around whoever's in them.
one size fits all.
you sure you have all that figured out?
I've flown birds a lot harder to manage than this one.
I'm surprised larrin didn't say anything.
Larrin's never brought you up before today.
really never?
Nope.
we're about to come out of hyperspace.
everyone, get ready.
see, I knew this would happen.
we burned it out.
we got here, though, didn't we?
any sign of the daedalus?
no.
looks like we beat them.
that's the first good news I've had all day.
wait, I've got two ships closing in.
shields up.
fire at will.
evasive maneuvers might be good.
I'm on it.
clear.
how come we haven't run into any of them yet?
I've got a bad feeling about this.
do a lifesigns scan, find out where they are.
I have a mass of lifesigns in the second 302 bay.
they fell back to their ship.
it's still in the bay.
why would they do that? They saw we'd armed up.
didn't want to risk a fight?
that doesn't sound like Todd.
I'm going to check it out.
take us out of hyperspace.
what is it?
they locked us out of flight controls.
can you get us back in?
not quickly.
what's he got planned?
okay, how long to get the device shut down?
five minutes.
all right, look.
you watch the-- oh, come on.
what?
what now?
well, something must have spooked them.
Why?
well, aside from encrypting the access to this workstation yeah, but you can break that.
Yeah, in a heartbeat, but, as they very well know, you can't operate this machine without the control key.
look-- the thing they stole from janus' lab to begin with.
they've taken it.
one down, one to go.
I'm picking up a third ship headed right for us.
wonderful.
that was close.
it flew into hyperspace.
what?
hold on, I've got another window opening.
they're coming right back at us.
what kind of messed-up battle technique is that?
it's quite a bit out, nowhere near the planet yet.
wait it's the Daedalus.
contact them.
we're going to need the help.
Colonel Sheppard.
surprised to see all of you guys.
same here.
look, I'm on a travelers-- I'm on a travelers ship.
we've engaged the enemy.
have you gotten the Daedalus back?
because we're going to need the help.
Todd let us take her back without so much as a fight.
but he's locked us out of the controls and retreated to one of the 302 bays.
why the hell would he do that?
he needs that place destroyed more than anyone.
Mr. Woolsey, sir.
what is it, Marks?
sir, the second we came out of hyperspace, a pre-programmed sub-routine kicked in.
meaning our main scanners located a facility on the planet and immediately locked the guidance system into it.
it's taking us to the attero device.
in a way sir, it's programmed a collision course.
that's how he's going to destroy the facility, by ramming us into it.
can't we just power down the entire facility?
you can't do much more than turn the lights off and on without the component thing.
we have to do something.
wait a second.
these suits were designed to protect the wearer from harsh environments, right?
technically, yes.
then I have a really terrible idea.
Oh, no, no.
you're not thinking what I think you're thinking.
the radiation in there would be pretty extreme.
not to mention those electrical discharges look pretty unfriendly, but yeah, but the antenna has a control crystal.
if we could pull it manually it's 50-50 we even get that far.
I'd go 30-70, but I don't have a better idea, and the suits, they should protect us.
we disabled the ship weapons.
you did?
ronon did, yeah.
they didn't have any other choice.
ramming the facility with the ship is the only sure-fire way to take it out.
killing all of us in the process.
I don't think he's that worried about us.
they just depressurized the 302 bay.
you ready?
let's just get this over with.
you know we both don't have to go in there.
well, when you get killed by one of those discharges, someone's going to have to finish the job, so oh, great pep talk.
Thanks.
I'm pretty sure we want to avoid those touching us.
Thanks, coach.
what are you waiting for?
I have to pull the right one or the antenna explodes.
hurry up.
but get it right.
how long before the daedalus hits the surface?
a minute, tops.
how many people on board?
couple hundred.
look, I've got an idea, but you'll have to trust me.
all right.
I need you to open up the hyperdrive in 30 seconds.
we're going to have to make a short jump -Impossible -Not a problem.
you can do this, Marks.
we're all counting on you.
I've almost got it.
we're entering the atmosphere. Okay.
here goes nothing.
what just happened?
you're welcome.
what did you do?
I just opened up a hyperspace window big enough for the both of us.
we just traveled through the planet.
I got it.
I'm back in.
we've got control of the ship.
and not a moment too late.
they found us again.
give them everything you've got!
okay.
you're okay, you're okay.
wrong again.
did you turn it off?
I did-- we did-- you did.
look, where does it hurt?
everywhere.
I don't suppose there's a hospital nearby.
I'm-- I'm pretty sure we're on our own.
good.
look, on the bright side, we'll both be dead of dehydration in, like, five days.
so you won't have to put up with me for much longer.
I'm, uh, I'm pretty busted up, Rodney.
I don't, I don't think I'm going to make it that long.
okay. I know it may not seem like it, but I want you to know I really res...
Oh, thank god.
I sure am glad to see you two.
he's badly hurt.
that's a new look for you.
well, you know me, it's function over fashion.
is the device still active?
not without this.
it's the facility's main control crystal.
that's not good enough for me.
Colonel Sheppard, we have drs Mckay and jackson.
our weapons are not operational.
can you please see to it that we never have to deal with the attero device again?
I'm locked on to its coordinates.
opening fire.
leveled.
good.
let's go home.
well, you want to unzip me?
I'll look for a can opener Zelenka has been a big help with ship repairs.
we should have her ready to fly in no time.
then what.
start a new settlement, I guess.
that's good to hear.
you tell Larrin I'll help you with whatever you need.
thank you.
we'll be in touch.
yeah I'm sure you will be.
tell Larrin she doesn't need to wait for the next galactic emergency to drop by.
I'm a lot more charming when my friends aren't about to die.
that's not what Larrin said.
see, she does talk about me.
every now and again.
what does she say?
what, not even a hint.
you all done for the day?
uh, dr. Cole's taking my shift. Yeah.
want to get something to eat?
listen, um, I'm really glad you came on the mission.
I mean, without you there, we'D probably all be dead.
but,
I just want to be clear, because, um...
I just want you to know, that, uh, I'm kind of interested in somebody else.
so?
I just didn't want to give you the wrong...
didn't I just, um, wanted to get something to eat.
okay, because I thought-- Yeah, well, you're wrong.
okay.
okay.
do you still want to go-- uh, no.
I should probably...
I should go.
how are you?
well, it hurts to eat this fruit cup.
don't eat the fruit cup, then.
thank you, Groucho.
listen, not that I don't appreciate the visits, but shouldn't you be trying to figure out a way to keep the asgards out of the shield again?
one step ahead of you.
that won't happen again.
good.
you don't think they'd make a run at us again?
well, I'm not sure, but we did ruin the one plan they had to feel free in this galaxy They might hold a grudge.
well, let's hope not.
Yeah, I heard they're sending you back to earth.
Yeah, I guess I need some major patching up and recovery.
Landry prefers I do that there instead of here, so the daedalus has already picked up a gate left over from the old gate bridge and my team is installing it as we speak so we should have you home in no time.
that's good.
that is good.
yes So well, it's been --unique --Yes, it has.
it sure has.
but I do want to say thank you for...
saying that you respected me when you thought I was about to die back there.
excuse me I said no such thing.
Yeah, you did You were, like...
I know it may not seem like it, but I really respect you, and that means a great deal to me.
I don't believe I ever finished that sentence.
how else would you have finished that sentence?
I would have said "regret."
I would have said I really regret you being here because none of this would have happened otherwise.
so you can only give compliments to the dying?
it's something I'm working on.
do you want to try any of this.
Ooh, fries.
Yeah,yeah Dive right in,take the-- take the deal there.
what is it?
something that will one daymake us completely immune to the wraith.
we want to test the serum's effectiveness against your prisoner.
we're talking about putting a human being in the same room as a starving wraith.
the test subjectis a terminally ill patient who has volunteered himself.
what have you done to me?
now we've been tracking what appears to be a new sickness in the Pegasus galaxy.
it's a unique protein originally created by the inhabitants of a planet called Hoff.
it was designed to interfere with the wraith's feeding mechanism, making them immune to the process.
it also killed the feeding wraith and half the people who took it.
well, let's not forget that Michael spread the modified Hoff an drug to dozens of worlds, possibly more.
I mean, no one knows for sure, right?
which means that every time you feed, you're taking a risk.
once more.
bad news, I'm afraid.
you'll have to go back to school tomorrow.
maintain the amoxicillin for three more days. That should do the trick.
now, what do we have over here?
all these dressings need to be changed.
do you mind going back to the store room and getting some more bandages, please?
Yes, doctor. - Thank you.
besides that, you're looking good, my friend. - Mail call.
Colonel! What are you all doing here?
well, we heard you needed supplies, so we thought we'd come by and see how you were doing.
a "hop, skip, and a jump from the gate"? That's what you call that?
nice to see you too, Rodney.
how are you, doctor? - Well, thanks.
I take it these are the antibiotics I ordered?
Dr. Keller gave you a whole whack of them, so they should last for a while.
Ah, god, I wish that were true. - What does that mean?
well, I've been dealing with a number of infections from the Hoffan plague survivors.
I can barely keep on top of it.
survivors of the Hoffan plague here?
this is not one of the planets that Michael targeted.
no, but many of these people actually come from another planet, Balar.
they managed to survive the plague, and just when they're starting to get their pieces back together, the wraith showed up, tried to wipe them out.
mm, we heard rumors about that.
well, the wraith aren't too pleased to have whole populations out there that are immune to their feeding.
just a handful of the Balarans survived.
the locals were kind enough to take them in.
doctor? - Novo!
these are my friends from Atlantis. Colonel Sheppard, Teyla, Ronon, and Dr. Rodney Mckay.
this is Novo. She's been helping me here in the clinic.
pleasure to meet you.
you as well. I've heard a lot about you.
is he the one?
the one what?
from all the funny stories.
right! Yeah, well, I hope you all can stay here for dinner?
I mean, the canteen's not fancy, but they do serve up one heck of a stew, made from a goat-like creature. Delicious!
Goat-like? - I think it's a great idea.
gives us a chance to catch up and relive all those... "funny stories."
so how's life in the wilds of Pegasus?
you got to be missing Atlantis by now.
surprisingly, no.
Oh, come on. The hot baths, playstation, deodorant?
I know it seems a wee bit rough, but it's not, really.
wherever I go, people are kind to me. I never want for a meal or a place to sleep.
and to be honest with you, I'm really starting to feel like I'm making a difference.
what is it?
I count nine of 'em. We can take 'em.
no. There's too many civilians.
it does not appear to bean ordinary culling.
how do you figure that?
well, for one thing, there are no darts, and they do not seem to be attacking the villagers.
who among you speaks for the rest?
I'm Elson...leader of this village.
what do you want with us?
you've recently taken in a group of refugees from another planet.
they are survivors of a plague.
it's important that you turn them over to me immediately.
Why? - The reasons why do not concern you.
provided you cooperate, you have my word we will leave peacefully.
and if we don't?
that would be a very unwise decision.
our hive will be here before the night is through.
if you have not complied by then, I will give the word, and your entire village will be destroyed.
turn over these outsiders, and your lives will be spared.
resist, and you will all die together.
the choice is yours.
I don't understand. They've already destroyed our homeworld.
why would they hunt the rest of us down as well?
you didn't tell them?
not the whole story.
what are you talking about?
novo, remember when I told you that, as a plague survivor, you'd be immune to the wraith feeding?
well, there's a bit more to it than that.
any wraith who tries to feed on you, or anyone like you, will, as a result, die instantly.
you're poison to them.
then we're as good as dead. - Not necessarily.
they won't tolerate our presence anywhere. Not if what you say is true.
just because they found you on this world does not mean that there is nowhere you can hide.
Novo? Did you hear?
Yes. This is Sefaris. He's also from Balar.
the councilors are meeting to discuss whether or not to heed the wraith's request.
what? Where? - The mine office.
I tried to get in, but they turned me away.
ronon and Teyla, scope out the gate. You two stay here. Watch these people.
can you show me where this mine office is? - Yes.
Colonel, what are you going to say to them?
I'm going to give them another way out.
you're telling us that, as a result of this plague, the Balarans are now deadly to the wraith?
pretty much.
so the wraith would never risk culling this village?
mm, that's true, but that's also why they're willing to wipe you guys out completely.
a village that can't be culled is no good to them.
did they know? - What?
did the Balarans know they were bringing this curse upon us when they came here?
no. They had no idea.
it's not their fault, Jervis.
maybe not, but that doesn't matter.
the wraith won't rest until every last plague survivor in this galaxy is dead.
except the wraith have no idea who they are unless people like you point them out.
I'm not happy about this either, Colonel, but what other choice do we have?
well...
we may be able to move all your people to a different planet, where they'll be safe.
you mean leave our homes?
I know it's not ideal, but the only other choice is to turn in a bunch of innocent people, and I know you guys aren't going to do that, right?
well, as the wraith said, they're outsiders.
Jervis, we agreed to let them come here.
I didn't agree.
besides, they weren't a threat at the time.
now that's changed.
but they've become like family.
novo lives under my roof. She eats at my table. My daughter adores her.
what am I supposed to tell her?
you'd prefer that we all be killed?
Colonel Sheppard, come in. - Excuse me.
go ahead.
ronon and I are at the gate. It does not appear to be heavily guarded.
it's the same guys from the village. I recognize the commander.
what are the odds of you two getting by 'em?
pretty good.
slim, actually, but much better if you and Rodney join us.
Yeah, all right.
hold your position till we can get there.
what is it?
how many people are in this village?
600, 700.
well, we'll be tight for time, but we can manage.
what are you suggesting?
we take the wraith out, get everybody through the gate before the hive ship comes.
you should be safe in Atlantis till we can relocate you.
unacceptable.
the Balarans don't deserve this.
they did nothing but survive a sickness.
it could just as easily have happened to us.
if we turn these people over, we are no better than the wraith ourselves.
look.
even if you cooperate with the wraith, there's no guarantee they're going to keep their word.
they may just kill all of you for being an inconvenience.
all right. What do you want us to do?
be ready to move. Take only what you can carry.
let's go, Rodney. We're going to hit the wraith.
we are? - I'll come with you.
not a chance, Doc. - Colonel
I don't have time argue. Get these people ready for transport.
once the gate's secure, we're going to have to move fast.
okay, but be careful.
if we're going to attack, we got to do it from over there.
agreed.
as soon as we take the gate, we should call in some jumpers.
it'll make evacuating the village a lot faster.
not to mention we can use the extra firepower in case the hive gets here before we're done.
Oh, let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Colonel sheppard, come in. - Go ahead.
we have a problem.
more of the wraith have begun arriving back. They must have been out on patrol.
how many? Can we still get out?
no. For the time being, we're stuck here.
you said you could get us out.
well, there are more wraith than we thought. The gate's too heavily guarded.
so we're trapped? - For the moment.
I haven't given up hope. I just need time to develop a new strategy.
what strategy do you propose we use to defeat an army of wraith?
well, I don't know. I haven't thought of it yet.
look, worst-case scenario-my team and I don't show up, the people back on Atlantis will dial the gateand contact us by radio.
I can order back-up.
will that happen before the hive ship arrives?
probably not.
we can't wait that long.
for all we know, the wraith could be lying about the ship.
and why would they do that?
I'm just saying, we need to stall as long as possible.
this is madness.
elson, we have to think of the safety of our people.
Oh, I'm thinking about the safety of your people. All your people!
we can't rely on their help.
we have to make our own decisions.
I need time to think about this.
the time for that has passed, Elson. We have to act.
and if you're not prepared to do so, then I will.
what's he going to do?
I don't know.
Where's Novo and the others?
we sent them home. Why?
can these people walk?
well, if need be, but I thought we couldn't get them through the gate.
no, we can't for the time being, but I don't think they're safe here either.
grab your weapons.
come with me.
get out of my way.
she's not here, Jervis.
where is she?
what are we going to do, Novo?
we have to get out of the village.
what the hell's going on out there?
some of the villagers decided to take matters into their own hands.
well, let's go stop 'em.
first things first. We got to move these people. Grab some gear.
we don't want any trouble. Just hand over the Balarans.
I don't think so.
don't make things difficult, colonel.
you had your chance to save the village. Now it's my turn.
saving the village? That's what you call this?
this isn't your affair.
it's up to us to decide how to deal with the situation.
Yes, it is, but Jervis, this is not our way.
our way?
our way is what got us into this situation in the first place!
we've already given them more than they could have ever asked for.
all right, why not just shoot them right now and get it over with?
it's a death sentence anyway. Shoot them yourself, and spare them the torment of being tortured by the wraith.
you'd be doing them a favor. - Carson.
go on! Kill them all, then, if you're that desperate to be done with them!
you're making a big mistake.
maybe, but at least we do so with a clear conscience.
doesn't matter anyway.
what are you talking about?
my men are already on the way to the gate with the first group we captured.
it's too late.
what are they going to do to us?
be calm, Sefaris. You're scaring the others.
maybe they should be scared.
we both know there's no escape from this.
we cannot give up hope.
face it, Novo... we've been betrayed.
they don't want us here. They never did.
we were doomed the moment we had to leave our homes.
and, to think...
as a survivor, I used to consider myself one of the lucky ones.
is Jervis taken care of?
he and his men have been locked up. They will not be giving us any more trouble, though I do not think it was necessary to stun them.
felt good, though.
so what now?
well, I got to get the rest of the Balarans out of the village.
there's no telling if anybody else might feel the way Jervis does.
where should we take them? - The forest?
it's kind of a long haul at night.
wait a minute. What about the mine?
these tracks lead right down to it. I mean, we just follow them.
no one gets lost. - Exactly.
all right.
go get Beckett and his patients. Bring them here. We'll round up everyone else.
what is it? - Something's happening.
what's going on?
you'll be moving shortly. - Where?
your new home.
the hive shiphas just arrived.
wait.
I have a proposition for you.
what are you doing, Sefaris?
something we should have done a long time ago.
there is nothing you have to offer me. - Don't be so sure.
there's someone hiding in the village.
he's of far greater value than all of us put together.
Sefaris, no - spare our lives, I'll take you to him.
a fair attempt... but the answer's no.
my life, then.
how could you do this?
I promise, it'll be worth your while.
I believe that is everybody.
Where's Mckay and Beckett?
Rodney, what's your status?
still at the clinic. Carson decided to pick up a few more supplies.
tell him to get a move on. We can't stay here forever.
go ahead, Colonel. We'll catch up.
you sure? - Absolutely. We'll be right behind you.
let's get going. Stay together. Follow the tracks.
there. That should do it.
Rodney, can you give me a hand here?
remind me to bring a Sherpa next time I visit.
him. He's the one.
you see? I kept up my end of the bargain.
so you did.
unfortunately, in light of your..."condition..."
keeping you alive is far too risky.
darts.
Rodney and Carson are still not here.
Rodney, come in.
you guys keep moving. I'm going to goget him.
ronon? Teyla? - Go ahead.
the wraith just got Beckett and Mckay.
what? How?
took 'em up in a dart.
I think they're on their way up to a hive.
how did the wraith know that they were in the village?
I think I got an idea.
Rodney. Rodney, wake up.
God, is it me, or have they juiced up the stun weapons?
Oh, and they brought us to the hive. That's great.
what are we going to do?
uh, just don't-don't panic. Don't panic.
I have... got lots of experience escaping from these things.
you do? - Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I've been in this situation dozens of times, always figured a way out.
how, exactly? - Uh, let's see.
last time, Teyla was posing as a Queen, so...
you know, she had us released.
not much chance of that happening. - No, I guess not.
how about the time before that?
ronon's friend Tyre was pretending to be in league with the wraith, but really he was on our side, so...
he let us out.
I'm starting to sense a pattern here.
you've actually never really escaped from one of these cells on your own?
first time for everything, right? - Oh, god, Rodney.
well, just... give me a minute. I'll think of something.
I hate to pressure you, Rodney, but I don't think we have a minute.
bring them.
what is this place?
a lab belonging to my top scientist.
for the last six month she has been studying the deadly toxin that has infiltrated our food supply.
where is he now?
dead.
he was convinced he had arrived at a fool proof way to detect the poison.
to prove it, he decided to feed on one of his test subjects.
guess that didn't work out so well?
he died in excruciating pain.
needless to say, his research has been stalled ever since.
and that's where you come in, doctor.
me? What do you expect me to do?
the one who identified you said you had considerable expertise in dealing with the toxin.
he even said you had a hand in developing it.
if anyone can find a way to detect it, you can.
if you think I'm going to help you, you're sorely mistaken.
I anticipated you might say that, which is why I'm prepared to offer you an incentive.
thus far, I have spared the lives of the people on the planet below.
if you cooperate, I will continue to do so.
but if either of you try to cross me in any way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we get the picture.
I knew you'd come to see it my way.
get to work.
give me one reason why I shouldn't blow your head off.
what for?
how did the wraith know to grab Beckett?
w- what do you mean? Doctor's been captured?
I swear, I had nothing to do with that.
what about your men? - No. No, there's no way.
the doctor has been nothing but good to us.
well, they didn't just stumble across the clinic. Somebody brought them there.
well, why don't you ask the Balarans?
they're the ones with the most to gain.
one of them probably thought he could save himself by turning in the doctor.
I told you they were no good, Colonel.
damn it.
none of these consoles are hooked into anything.
I can't access any of the ship's systems. What about you?
you making any progress?
Hey! You okay?
I can't do this, Rodney.
what do you mean? You don't understand it?
no. I mean, I can't do it.
do you realize what'll happen if the wraith find a way to detect the Hoffan drug?
they'll hunt down every last person in this galaxy that has it.
that's hundreds of thousands of people, Rodney.
not to mention the fact that, when they're finished, they can start feeding again, indiscriminately.
what's the alternative, huh?
we know the wraith aren't just going to let the matter drop.
we've seen what they can do. They'll- they'll wipe out entire villages just to get a few like the Balarans.
so what am I supposed to do?
you just stall. You know, you make it look like you're working, and...
till we figure out how to get the hell out of here.
and then what? Go about our business? Pretend this never happened?
I never said it was going to be easy.
but you can't solve all the galaxy's problems in one day.
look, I understand. You feel guilty. But this is not your fault.
you had no idea that any of this was going to happen.
one of the first things they taught us in medical school was "do no harm."
now, I'm at a loss right now to figure out how that's even possible in this situation.
how are they doing?
they are frightened.
I've been trying to reassure them, but it is of little use.
how's it going in here?
we are getting by. What is happeningin the village?
Ah, not much. Everybody's hiding indoors.
why hasn't the hive ship attacked yet?
do you think it could have something to do with Rodney and Carson's capture?
I don't know, but we should use this time to come up with a plan.
you got anything?
maybe, but it's going to take some work.
what is it? You got something?
no.
you sure? You got one of those "Beckett" faces.
aye, I'm sure, Rodney. Just go back to work.
where are you going? - To talk to the hive commander.
what? Why?
there's something I need to tell him.
Oh, I knew it. You found something. What is it?
Hey, open up! - Seriously, will you just tell me?
you know I'm going to go through your stuff as soon as you're gone.
just leave me be, Rodney. Open the door!
will you just tell me what's going on?
I need to talk to the commander right away.
listen to me, Rodney. I need you to stay here.
don't worry. Everything will be just fine.
right.
doctor. I didn't expect to hear from you so soon.
this must be good news. - For some people, maybe.
I'm here to tell you that I'm off the case.
what are you talking about?
I'm not going to do your dirty work for you. Find someone else.
there is no one else! - Then that's too bad for you, isn't it?
you're trying my patience, doctor.
you forget, I control the fate of the people below.
people will die no matter what I do, so I'm not going to do anything.
if you refuse to complete the research, then there is only one other way that you could be of use to me.
and, trust me, you won't like it.
you don't scare me anymore. Do you understand?
I don't give a damn what you do to me.
suit yourself. I'm going to enjoy this very much.
what is this?
what have you done to me?
turns out you were closer to detecting the Hoffan drug than you thought.
it didn't take me long to perfect your blood test.
and once I confirmed it using samples that you provided,
I decided to do one more test, just to be certain... on me.
you have the toxin? - Indeed.
and now... so do you.
Carson! - Hello, Rodney. Can you delete this data?
Yeah, of course, but how did you - I talked the hive commander into feeding on me.
what? What? Why would you do that?
I have the Hoffan drug, Rodney.
michael must have given it to me as a defense against the wraith.
well, why didn't you tell me?
because you would have stopped me from going.
Yeah, because it's stupid! What would've happened if you were wrong?
I had to do something. It's the only chance we had to get away.
now, will you help me destroy this research before they find out what I've done?
right. - Okay, great.
the coast is clear.
what are we doing, exactly? - What do you think?
we're looking for a way off this ship.
by wandering aimlessly through the hallways?
I'm not wandering aimlessly. I'm exploring.
there's a big difference.
Bingo!
what are you doing, Rodney?
hacking into the ship's communications.
are you sure that's a good idea?
look, if we don't get in touch with Sheppard, we don't stand any chance of getting off this ship.
you're going to have to cover me.
all right. From which direction?
what was that?
Sheppard, do you read me?
McKay, is that you?
Oh! Thank god! Okay, we are on the hive ship. I've got Beckett with me.
what the hell is going on up there?
we managed to escape.
Beckett helped.
Oh, that's great, 'cause we could really use the help.
you? Look, we're the ones stuck on the ship!
that's exactly where you need to be right now, because we need someone to take out the hive's main weapons.
what?
we got a plan, but it's only going to work if we take the hive out of the picture.
it is bad enough that I hacked into communications!
if I start messing around with other systems, they'll track us down in a matter of minutes!
Rodney, it's the only way to get these people to safety.
once that's done, we'll figure out a way to get you guys out of there.
all right. I'll see what I can do.
give me a few minutes. That should be enough time.
you're a good man, Rodney.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just don't forget us, okay?
we won't. Good luck.
think he'll be able to pull it off? - Well, he'd better.
otherwise this thing's going to go very badly.
Jervis. - What do you want?
we need to talk.
well, I have nothing to say to you.
you were right all along. I should have listened to you.
the Atlantians have no idea what they're doing.
they claim to have a plan, but, in reality, they're just putting all our lives at risk.
well...
it's a little late now, isn't it?
is it?
if you went to the wraith at the gate right now, do you think you could get them to honor the original deal?
it's possible.
but... I'd have to deliver all of the remaining outsiders at once.
they're in the mine, hiding in the main chamber.
are the other councilors on board with this?
the less they know about it, the better.
and you?
can you reconcile this with your conscience?
leave that to me. You just make that deal.
what is it?
search the ship.
how long is this going to take, Rodney?
do I rush you while you're performing complicated surgery?
aye, it's been known to happen.
all right, I'm in.
now, I just need a few minutes to disable the
Oh, geez! I think they found us!
you figure?
okay, you're going to have to hold them off.
am I, now? - Yeah. Come on, Carson. You can do this, all right?
all right. On three?
how about on one? - All right.
right. And, one!
how's it coming?
almost there.
I can't hold them off forever, Rodney!
we have to go! Now!
all right, that's it! I got it! Let's go!
where are we going? - The dart bay.
you know how to fly a dart? - Well, I've flown jumpers before.
I've been to Tokyo before. Doesn't mean I can speak Japanese.
well, how hard can it be?
do you even know where you're going?
Yeah, I pulled up a schematic of the ship on that console.
what? While we were being fired upon?
all right, that's sealed.
how long do you think it'll hold them? - Not very.
well, come on.
what are you doing? - I'm getting in.
well, we can't both fit in here.
you're damn right I can. Now shove over!
you comfy? - Peachy.
what are you waiting for?
well, it should just start up. - Well, it didn't.
I know, but it doesn't make sense. A canopy should form over our head.
maybe there's some kind of a weight limit?
what's that supposed to mean?
I mean because there's two of us!
well, maybe you need a key, or something? - It's not a Volkswagen, Carson!
okay, look, these are obviously the flight controls. That makes that propulsion, so...
Where'd you come up with that brilliant conclusion?
it's just common sense!
come on! - Right, common sense.
what do youwant from me? It's not likethere's labels!
Oh, not good! - You're telling me. We need a new plan, Rodney.
I know! I'm thinking!
well, whatever you do, think fast, because if those wraith come through that door, we're both dead.
Rodney, we need to go.
where? I mean, we're trapped in here!
then we need to find a place to hide. Come on.
what? - I have another idea.
it's a long shot, but it might work.
but you're going to have to get off me!
once you've taken these people, you're going to leave the village, right? For good?
this place is of no concern to us.
all we want is the Balarans.
there's a large chamber up ahead. That's where they're hiding.
where are they?
I don't understand. He said they were here!
I... they should be right here!
what is this?
think we killed enough wraith to make a difference?
guess we'll find out.
nice work.
we've received word of an explosion on the planet that's killed several of our warriors.
the humans continueto attack our troops.
they're trying to escape.
target the area around the porta land open fire.
weapons aren't responding!
what?
dial the gate.
this is the first group. There are more are coming.
we've got to move fast. They won't take this lying down. Let's go.
all right. Come on, let's go. Stay level, stay low.
we've lost contact with the troops at the gate.
what about the two human prisoners?
they're nowhere to be seen.
they couldn't have just disappeared. It doesn't matter.
we can't let the villagers escape.
launch the darts.
Colonel!
go, go, go!
Oh, crap!
Sheppard! We've got more coming!
go, go, go! You're almost there.
Rodney! Carson! - Oh, my god, it worked!
Rodney, you're a genius! - What'd you do?
I reprogrammed the culling beam to dematerialize us, then to discharge only from that point on.
once the wraith lost their main weapons, it was just a matter of time for them to launch the darts.
let's go!
there you are! I've been calling you.
Oh, I'm sorry. What's up?
Lorne's team just found a suitable planet for the villagers.
they're going to move them out this afternoon.
aye, I heard. I'm going with them.
Oh, right. Of course. Um, well, you want to... grab some lunch?
we didn't get any chance to socialize this time around, unless you count, you know, running through the halls of the hive ship as social time.
aye, you're right.
look, Rodney, I'd love to, but I really need to get through this.
well, what is it?
Dr. Keller's research on the serum that keeps my cells from deteriorating.
I think there might be something in here to help the plague survivors, since I'm not getting the infections that they are.
well, you don't have to do this now. I'll download the data to a drive.
you can just, you know, take it with you.
actually, you can't.
Mr. Woolsey doesn't want it leaving the base.
I'm sorry, rodney. - Well, I don't care.
I was just, you know, trying to stop you from whining about never seeing me.
all right.
Rodney, wait.
now that I think of it, I am a wee bit peckish.
besides, I can't solve all the galaxy's problems in one day, can I?
well, I - shut it.
right, let's go.
so? Interested in anyone these days?
me? - No, I don't have time for that.
you're a terrible liar, Dr. Mckay. Tell me, tell me, tell me.
as you may have already heard, we've received an invitation.
or, more precisely, your team has received an invitation to represent Atlantis at a meeting of leaders from various human populations throughout the pegasus galaxy.
what's this, a pegasus version of the united nations?
nothing quite so formal.
at the moment, it's more of a loose coalition.
is there any advanced technology in this "coalition"?
no.
but the IOA believes it could be an important first step toward interplanetary government.
a... federation, if you will.
the federation had ships.
look, what do we hope to gain from this?
the only reason these people even know about each other is because they happened to inherit the gate system from the ancients.
just because they lack advancement does not mean they cannot benefit from cooperation.
she's right.
it's about time people in this galaxy got together and stood up for themselves.
against the waith?
why not?
the waith are at war with each other, which is why the people trying to form this coalition feel the time is right.
and they want us to be part of it.
the council liaison will be with you in a moment.
they're really rolling the red carpet out for us, huh?
I'm sure they're just trying to keep the details of this meeting secret.
uh, guys... not good.
inquisition
where are we?
we're not in the same room.
we've been moved.
what the hell happened?
that's a good question.
what is the meaning of this?
it will all be explained shortly.
the council wishes to speak to it. Colonel Sheppard.
I am kelore of latira.
this is Shiana of the tribes of Santhal, and Dimas of the free peoples of Riva.
we speak on behalf of the coalition.
you know, if you wanted to keep this location secret, you could have just blindfolded me.
I wouldn't have peeked, I swear.
lt. Colonel John Sheppard, you stand before this council as a representative of the atlantis expedition.
okay.
and as such, it falls to you to answer the charges.
excuse me?
you will be given ample opportunity to present your defense, and when all evidence is heard, we will decide the outcome.
what the hell are you talking about? What is this?
the atlantis expedition has been accused of crimes against the peoples of this galaxy.
this is your trial.
major, what happened?
we're still trying to figure that out, sir.
one thing's for sure, they're not in the village anymore.
they wouldn't have gone anywhere else without notifying us first.
not voluntarily, no.
take as many men as you need. Search the entire area.
and keep questioning the villagers.
somebody there knows something.
this was supposed to be a meet-and-greet.
just cocktails, maybe a little dancing?
subterfuge was necessary.
you possess technology and military power beyond the scope of most of the indigenous peoples of this galaxy.
which is why you have been brought to a secure location.
only the members of this council and key personnel know the gate address.
so don't waste your time entertaining any hopes of rescue.
what is it exactly that you think we did?
according to our calculations, the atlantis expedition is responsible, directly or indirectly, for the deaths of over two million people in this galaxy.
you've got to be kidding me.
tell us about your first encounter with the waith.
Oh.
I see where this is going.
when you arrived here, the waith were in hibernation, were they not?
not all of them.
what do you mean?
I mean they attacked us.
what is it?
take that thing down!
that's one.
get down!
that was a scouting party, not a culling.
well, I didn't know that.
all I know is they took our people.
and you went after them.
that's right.
you should have left them to their fate.
Oh, I'm sure that's what you would've done, but that's not how we operate.
what happened?
well, we went in, we rescued as many people as we could, then we got out.
but not before encountering a queen.
no.
how did this come to you?
I don't remember.
light it up!
that has to kill you.
sir, let's go.
you don't know what you have done.
we are merely the caretakers for those that sleep.
when I die, the others will awaken...
...all of them.
what's she talking about?
how many are left?
so you admit it.
you woke the waith.
look, sooner or later, they were going to wake up on their own anyway.
but not for generations.
you see, Colonel, most of the human populations of this galaxy have not yet fully recovered from the last round of cullings.
as a result of this early awakening, several worlds have been driven to the point of extinction
their survivors scattered, their civilizations lost forever.
we're out there fighting the waith, day after day, putting our asses on the line.
but the fact remains, many who have been killed would be alive today if you had never come here.
isn't that true? - That's it, I'm not playing in this game anymore.
this is just the first of many charges.
if you refuse to participate, it'll be taken as an admission of guilt on all counts, and we will have no choice but to proceed to sentencing.
what are you going to do? Put everybody in Atlantis in jail?
obviously that's not possible.
however, we can refuse cooperation.
that means no more trade, no more relations of any kind.
Atlantis will be completely isolated.
no relations with the likes of you?
I think we can handle that.
the coalition grows in strength and influence every day.
soon enough, all of your current trading partners will have no choice but to join and therefore to abide by the ruling of this council.
as for you and your team, an example must be made.
justice demands it.
justice-- is that what you're calling this?
a suitable, uninhabited planet has been chosen.
if you're found guilty, you'll be sent there, without any hope of return, for the rest of your natural lives.
apparently, the planet they picked for us has just enough food for us to survive, so, technically, it's not an execution.
great.
and they took the DHD, so whoever comes through the gate
they're not coming back.
the Daedalus can find us.
if they had the address.
short of that, they'd need to search every solar system in the galaxy for a habitable planet, which would take, what, a million years?
right. Let's not panic.
I've been to the chamber a couple of times now.
I'm beginning to get a sense of the layout.
the architecture is definitely different from that of the village.
no, we're on another planet.
judging by the fact there's no natural light or windows,
I'm guessing an underground bunker.
guards?
Yeah. Half a dozen or so.
we're going to have to see if they change in shifts.
any chance you could just convince them that we're not guilty?
cause we're not, right?
Oh, come on, there is no way the pegasus galaxy would be better off if we'd never come here.
no.
but since your arrival, there have been setbacks.
lives have been lost.
but there is hope now where once there was none.
look, as much as I'd like to tell these guys where to put their little trial, we'll just have to play along for a while until we figure out how to get out of here.
Mr. Woolsey, this is Myrus.
he claims to be a representative for the new coalition of planets.
does he?
are you the leader of Atlantis?
that's right.
then we need to speak.
well, what's next on the agenda?
did we step on the rose bushes on our last trip to Vedeena?
perhaps you've heard of a plague that's recently swept through several worlds, a sickness that arrives suddenly, runs its course in a matter of days, and typically kills one out of every three men, women, and children wherever it strikes.
there are those who believe it is not a sickness at all but a deliberate poisoning, the work of one individual.
I know who you're talking about. His name is Michael.
it is said that he is neither human nor waith, but some kind of half-breed.
can you explain to us how such a thing is possible?
one of our people was conducting research.
they were trying to come up with a way to solve the waith problem once and for all.
you found a way to convert waith into humans?
don't ask me the medical questions. I'm not a doctor.
and this Michael was one of your test subjects?
as a matter of fact, he was the first.
blood pressure's fine, pulse normal. You're bouncing back quite nicely.
bouncing back from what?
Hello, Michael.
do you remember me?
no.
I'm Dr. Elizabeth Weir.
this is Lt. Colonel John Sheppard.
you served under my command.
your name is lieutenant Michael Kenmore.
you're in a private room off the infirmary here in Atlantis.
is that familiar to you?
Yeah.
I think.
we tried to convince him he was one of us.
but he knew something was wrong, and then he found proof.
five milligrams!
release me!
you will die for this!
others will come for me!
they will- blah blah blah.
they've got to find us first.
you're going to need a name.
how does "mike" sound?
after that, he escaped.
he went back and forth between waith and human a couple more times until he finally settled somewhere in between.
so once again you admit your guilt.
you unleashed this... thing on the galaxy.
we didn't just let him out the front door and forget about him.
we've been chasing him ever since.
a couple of months ago, we managed to catch up with him.
fire in the hole.
what happened?
the hyperdrive just exploded.
no, that's impossible.
main power is out across much of the ship.
an accidental overload? It doesn't appear that way.
how did they do that?
I will look into it.
Daedalus, please come in.
Colonel Sheppard, what the hell happened to your jumper?
hell, I got all turned around in the parking garage.
I was in a rush, so I borrowed this dart.
I've got the team beamed in to a storage device.
feel free to do whatever you want to that cruiser.
major Marks, please make that ship go away.
Yes, sir.
are you sure he was killed?
the ship was vaporized. There was no body to recover.
well, then, you cannot testify before this council, and under the eyes of the ancestors, that you know for certain that he is dead.
no.
this is outrageous.
you're telling me that one of the first official acts of your new government was to assault and kidnap my people?
they weren't assaulted. They were arrested.
you've got to be kidding me.
believe me, not all of us agreed with this decision, but it wasn't taken entirely without reason.
we've been trying to help you people.
what you've been doing is making unilateral decisions that affect the lives of millions, without consultation and without accountability.
this is no longer acceptable.
I'm not going to get drawn into a debate here.
I only need to know one thing
where are my people being held?
of course I can't tell you that.
fair trials don't take place in secret locations.
nevertheless
I think Mr. Myrus needs a little time to reconsider his position here.
escort him to a cell.
my pleasure.
you're making a mistake.
am I?
when I was chosen to deliver this message, I knew there was a chance I wouldn't be coming back.
but if you detain me, you will only be confirming what many already suspect
that you're a rogue element in this galaxy, operating without restraint or due process.
lock him up.
let's go.
all right.
I'm not saying we haven't made some mistakes, but that's 'cause we're the only ones out there fighting.
nobody else is out there taking on the waith.
but isn't that your own fault as well?
what are you talking about?
the genii had a plan to combat the waith, but they were thwarted when you betrayed them.
Oh, is that what they told you? Because that's not what I remember.
Where's my father?
he did not survive.
how?
what happened?
I think we should find out.
take aim!
I thought we were just learning how to get along.
she killed Tyrus.
no.
by leaving him to die, you may just as well have killed him yourself.
we will keep this intelligence information and your ship, and whatever quantities of C4 you have in your possession.
that is all you ever intended-- to use us.
your weapons.
no.
I don't think so.
this is what your father died for?
in the name of people who would lie and steal from those they would call friends?
well, I lied too.
jumpers two and three, execute.
did you really think we had one ship?
so you betrayed each other.
we came prepared.
they made the first move.
look, the genii plan was never going to work anyways.
they had bombs they couldn't finish without our help, they had no methods of delivery.
if you want a military victory against the waith, we're your only chance.
you've been in touch with our off-world contacts?
Yes, sir.
And?
nobody knows anything.
at least, that's what they're saying.
you don't believe them?
well, frankly, right now, I don't know what to believe, sir.
these people are supposed to be our friends, but if we can't just walk into an ordinary village without worrying about an ambush, what's the point?
we're not there yet.
I refuse to believe that the whole galaxy has turned against us.
well, it might as well, because right now we have nothing.
maybe not...
come with me.
open it.
Mr. Myrus, I have a proposal for you.
so you claim to have had military success against the waith?
we've done our share of damage. Even managed to take a few hive ships out here and there.
Really?
and how did you manage to accomplish this remarkable feat?
well, I can tell you one thing-- it's never easy, but one good trick is to get them to shoot at each other.
look. See that?
it's a dart firing at one of the hive ships.
Why?
Sheppard's actually getting them to fire at each other.
now, if two hive ships are going at it and you happen to be onboard one of them, that can be a bit of a problem.
that's when you have to improvise.
Teyla, Lorne, come in.
Colonel, where are you? - We're on our way.
you must hurry. The other hive has found us.
can you hold 'em off?
not for long.
approaching dart bay.
acknowledged.
they're inside.
Colonel, request permission to jump to hyperspace immediately.
negative. I have another idea.
Teyla, I want you to set a new course.
commander.
what is it?
we just received an urgent communication from the hive.
the enemy-- they're headed straight for us.
did I also mention that we have a fair amount of ancient technology at our disposal, because that can be pretty handy too.
there's a hive bearing down on your position.
Yes, sir, I see that.
stand by.
doc, they're killing us here. - I have it, I have it.
firing drones.
let's see, what else did I leave out?
there's been so many over the years, you know, it's hard to keep track.
enough.
you spin a colorful tale, Colonel.
that much is obvious.
yet for all these fantastic claims, we have no evidence but your word.
this trial is evidence.
your precious little coalition wouldn't even exist if we hadn't have pushed the waith so far back that you got an opportunity you haven't had in 10, 000 years.
your responsibility in this has already been determined.
you woke the waith early, before the population of this galaxy had sufficient time to recover, which eventually led to the waith going to war with each other over feeding grounds.
that war is what has given us this opportunity, not some imagined victory on your part.
we will take a recess.
please take the prisoner back to his cell.
Woolsey, what the hell are you doing here?
I've made an arrangement with your captors.
I'm taking over your defense.
suppose you managed to bring along a subspace locator beacon, did you?
that's waith technology.
it's not like we have one just lying around.
I even tried to contact Todd to see if we could borrow one, but he never responded.
what about the DHD on the planet we were ambushed?
you could pull the most recent addresses that were dialed.
already done. There were over 50 addresses in the buffer.
I almost cleaned out the entire city sending people to investigate all of them, but they turned up nothing.
so it would seem.
this was obviously very well thought out.
they had a very clever plan, but we're smarter and better armed.
there's got to be a way around this.
they took advantage of one significant weakness
we trusted them.
look, I came here because I have a plan to get you out of here.
well, what is it?
win the trial.
look, we were just playing along to buy us enough time to figure out a way out of here.
and how's that coming along?
well, we're-- we're working on it.
I was Harvard law review.
I was Chief Counsel of the US army corps of engineers.
prior to that, I was an appellate advocate for Hartshorne & Slaughter, one of the most prestigious litigation boutiques in all New York city.
believe me,
I can handle three tribal elders with a stack of papyrus.
some time ago, a number of human worlds were attacked and destroyed from space, not by the waith, but by someone else.
little is known of this mysterious race except that they possess incredibly advanced technology, and are rumored to be allies of Atlantis.
I think I know who you're referring to, and believe me, they are not our allies.
they're called replicators.
they were created by the ancients.
if you wish to know the truth of who we are, I will show you.
the ancients, as you call them, were desperate in their search for a better way to fight the waith.
though greatly outnumbered, they relied on their technological superiority to give them a needed advantage.
instead of building bigger, more powerful weapons, they chose to build smaller ones.
nanites.
in these tiny killing machines, the ancients imbued an aggression that surpassed even that of their enemy.
the technology allowed for organic assimilation and self-replication to increase their effectiveness.
and replicate they did.
they grew in numbers, evolving at a rate that took the ancients by surprise.
the molecular machines began interlocking, assembling themselves to form even more complex organisms, eventually evolving into the most effective and efficient form they knew of.
this is how we were born.
when the ancients concluded that we would never become the weapon they desired to create, they decided to end it.
so they chose to destroy us, to leave no trace of us behind.
some of them managed to survive.
that's right.
and as the name suggests, they replicated and rebuilt themselves into a powerful force.
Oh... my...
no kidding.
but why would they attack human worlds?
it was a strategy they developed in their campaign against the waith
eliminate the enemy's food supply.
there's one thing I don't understand, Mr. Woolsey.
if, as you suggest, they were originally designed to fight the waith, why did they wait until now?
I got the ZPM. We're leaving.
wait a minute. We can't go.
what are you talking about? You said you could get the hyperdrive back online.
I mean, we can, but not yet. Look, while Elizabeth's been connected, I've been going over the replicators' base code, and I found this.
what is that?
the holy grail.
it's their whole reason for being.
it's a command code that directs them to attack the waith.
Yeah, but they don't attack the waith.
they've been sitting on their nanite asses for 10,000 years.
that's because it's been deactivated.
are you telling us that you are the ones that activated the attack code?
we didn't know they were going to target human worlds.
no, because you acted rashly, without considering the consequences.
we had an opportunity, one that wasn't going to present itself again.
believe me, councilors, this decision was not taken lightly.
in fact, it cost us one of our best people.
get to the jumper.
you're coming with us.
I can't keep them frozen much longer.
we're not leaving you behind.
if you don't leave right now, none of us will get out of here, so go!
that's an order!
come on!
Elizabeth! - Go!
one of your people died, and you consider this a grave sacrifice?
as a matter of fact, I do.
then imagine how we feel
those of us who have witnessed the deaths of thousands.
we cannot be held responsible for the actions of the replicators.
Colonel Sheppard made the same argument in respect to the waith, and in that case I might be inclined to agree with him.
by your own admission, these replicators are machines.
so if I were to set a detonator, can I then later deny responsibility for the actions of the bomb?
by that logic, you might just as well blame the ancients.
they created them.
the ancients, as you call them, are not here to answer for their actions.
you are.
we know for certain of six human worlds that were destroyed by the replicators.
but we also know of at least a dozen hive ships that were destroyed, hive ships that would almost certainly have culled within a year.
one could make the argument that, on balance, more lives were saved than were lost.
on balance?
is that what we are to you?
figures on a ledger?
pieces that can be moved about in a game of strategy, some to be saved while others are sacrificed?
I'm sorry, I certainly didn't mean to diminish - real people are being killed, Mr. Woolsey, real villages destroyed
my village, my people.
my husband and children-- murdered before my eyes.
you're from one of the planets destroyed by the replicators.
I barely escaped with my life, but not before I saw everything I hold dear get wiped out by a beam of light from the sky.
and I will not rest until someone is made to pay for it.
well, I guess we can rule out getting her vote.
it's clearly inappropriate for someone that biased to be on the council.
so they stacked the deck against us.
I'm not sure.
Dimas seems to be a reasonable man.
I think he might even be persuaded to vote our way.
kelore is a little harder to read.
Yeah, he seemed pretty hostile to me.
didn't you say he was from Latira?
Yeah, that's right.
one of our last intelligence reports suggests a growing relationship between Latira and the genii.
Yeah, he did try to convince me that they should be the ones leading the fight against the waith.
you think the genii are behind this?
it makes sense.
apart from Atlantis, they're clearly the biggest military power in the coalition.
if they played their cards right, they could wind up running the whole thing.
but only with us out of the picture.
so we were right all along. This whole thing's fixed.
I say we go to plan B
wait for the guards come in, I beat 'em up, take their guns, we shoot our way out of here.
do we even know the way out?
we know we're at least two levels underground and there's no more than a dozen or so guards at any one time.
what about on the surface? How many guards are up there?
and which way is the gate? And how far?
there's a few things we'll have to figure out along the way.
it's too risky.
we could wind up being shot before we even got out of the building.
what other choice do we have? We know we can't win this thing.
what are you talking about?
I'm saying now that I know what the game is, I can play it.
thank you for agreeing to meet me.
wait outside.
it cost me rather a fine pocketwatch that used to belong to my father to get him to bring me here.
you shouldn't have bothered.
there's nothing I can do for you.
well, maybe I'm just feeling generous tonight.
speak plainly.
you're backing the wrong horse.
we know you're connected with the genii.
I don't know what you're talking about.
we also know they're looking to become the military muscle behind the coalition.
we think we'd make a better choice.
you?
that's right.
well, I didn't realize you had those kinds of ambitions.
we've been content to keep to ourselves up until now, but if it's a choice between getting pushed out of the game and taking a more active part, well, that's no choice at all, is it?
of course, for appearance's sake, we can't be too aggressive, so we'll need someone on the inside to help push our agenda...
someone to whom we'll be very, very grateful.
and how do I know you haven't made this offer to the others?
I think we both know Dimas will only be swayed by reason, and Shiana's going to vote against us, no matter what.
that leaves you.
Mr. Woolsey, are you ready to face the final charge?
I am.
the people of Atlantis stand accused of conspiring with the waith.
conspiring?
we have reports that Atlantis has negotiated with the waith and performed military operations with them.
it is said you have formed an alliance with one waith in particular.
that's what we call him.
this waith was imprisoned with Colonel Sheppard by the genii.
the waith was allowed to feed on him but, despite this, Colonel Sheppard realized that their best chance of escape was to work together.
which way?
this way.
and you continue to have dealings with this waith?
we have... occasional contact.
you trust him?
of course not.
but he has proven to be useful at times.
he helped us hold off the replicator fleet long enough for Dr. Mckay to enact a plan to destroy them.
interior suction.
transferring power from non-critical systems to hull regeneration.
our shields can't take much more of this, sir.
hopefully, they won't have to.
and get ready to transfer power from the beam weapons to the
what the hell?
son of a bitch.
he actually did it.
we need to get out of here. - Right. Let's go. Come on!
as much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go down.
we should tell the fleet to jump to the rendezvous point immediately.
the planet's become unstable.
the fact is we would never have defeated the replicators without his help.
I think it's safe to say they would have continued their policy of attacking human worlds and, by now, everyone in this galaxy would be dead.
very well.
as that was the final charge, we will recess to deliberate.
I'd like to make one final statement, if I may.
very well.
the waith are in disarray, but that won't last forever.
sooner or later, one faction will win out over the others.
and when that happens, they will turn their attention to this coalition with a ruthless vengeance, the likes of which you've never seen.
if you don't want us there when that day comes, fighting by your side, then, by all means, vote us guilty.
I need no deliberation.
I say we get this over with now.
very well.
I vote guilty, on all charges.
I vote not guilty on all charges.
it falls to you, Kelore.
yours is the deciding vote.
well? What's the word?
not guilty.
Oh, thank god.
we're free to go.
I never doubted you for a second.
whoo, nice suit.
being back in the courtroom made me miss my old uniform.
you're kidding.
not the job, just the uniform.
Oh, that's nice.
well, it seemed appropriate.
so, you going to tell me how you managed to pull this one off?
well, I'd say it was a combination of things
my legal skills, my eloquence, the indisputable logic of my arguments, and the bribe I offered Kelore.
on top of that,
I had to commit Atlantis to a much larger day-to-day participation in the politics of the pegasus galaxy.
a way to explain that in my report...
yeah...
well, what's the point of being out here if we don't try to make a difference, right?
let's hope the IOA agrees with you.
let's worry about that later. For now, congratulations.
Thanks.
as you may have already heard, we've received an invitation.
or, more precisely, your team has received an invitation to represent Atlantis at a meeting of leaders from various human populations throughout the pegasus galaxy.
what's this, a pegasus version of the united nations?
nothing quite so formal.
at the moment, it's more of a loose coalition.
is there any advanced technology in this "coalition"?
no.
but the IOA believes it could be an important first step toward interplanetary government.
a... federation, if you will.
the federation had ships.
look, what do we hope to gain from this?
the only reason these people even know about each other is because they happened to inherit the gate system from the ancients.
just because they lack advancement does not mean they cannot benefit from cooperation.
she's right.
it's about time people in this galaxy got together and stood up for themselves.
against the waith?
why not?
the waith are at war with each other, which is why the people trying to form this coalition feel the time is right.
and they want us to be part of it.
the council liaison will be with you in a moment.
they're really rolling the red carpet out for us, huh?
I'm sure they're just trying to keep the details of this meeting secret.
uh, guys... not good.
inquisition
where are we?
we're not in the same room.
we've been moved.
what the hell happened?
that's a good question.
what is the meaning of this?
it will all be explained shortly.
the council wishes to speak to it. Colonel Sheppard.
I am kelore of latira.
this is Shiana of the tribes of Santhal, and Dimas of the free peoples of Riva.
we speak on behalf of the coalition.
you know, if you wanted to keep this location secret, you could have just blindfolded me.
I wouldn't have peeked, I swear.
lt. Colonel John Sheppard, you stand before this council as a representative of the atlantis expedition.
okay.
and as such, it falls to you to answer the charges.
excuse me?
you will be given ample opportunity to present your defense, and when all evidence is heard, we will decide the outcome.
what the hell are you talking about? What is this?
the atlantis expedition has been accused of crimes against the peoples of this galaxy.
this is your trial.
major, what happened?
we're still trying to figure that out, sir.
one thing's for sure, they're not in the village anymore.
they wouldn't have gone anywhere else without notifying us first.
not voluntarily, no.
take as many men as you need. Search the entire area.
and keep questioning the villagers.
somebody there knows something.
this was supposed to be a meet-and-greet.
just cocktails, maybe a little dancing?
subterfuge was necessary.
you possess technology and military power beyond the scope of most of the indigenous peoples of this galaxy.
which is why you have been brought to a secure location.
only the members of this council and key personnel know the gate address.
so don't waste your time entertaining any hopes of rescue.
what is it exactly that you think we did?
according to our calculations, the atlantis expedition is responsible, directly or indirectly, for the deaths of over two million people in this galaxy.
you've got to be kidding me.
tell us about your first encounter with the waith.
Oh.
I see where this is going.
when you arrived here, the waith were in hibernation, were they not?
not all of them.
what do you mean?
I mean they attacked us.
what is it?
take that thing down!
that's one.
get down!
that was a scouting party, not a culling.
well, I didn't know that.
all I know is they took our people.
and you went after them.
that's right.
you should have left them to their fate.
Oh, I'm sure that's what you would've done, but that's not how we operate.
what happened?
well, we went in, we rescued as many people as we could, then we got out.
but not before encountering a queen.
no.
how did this come to you?
I don't remember.
light it up!
that has to kill you.
sir, let's go.
you don't know what you have done.
we are merely the caretakers for those that sleep.
when I die, the others will awaken...
...all of them.
what's she talking about?
how many are left?
so you admit it.
you woke the waith.
look, sooner or later, they were going to wake up on their own anyway.
but not for generations.
you see, Colonel, most of the human populations of this galaxy have not yet fully recovered from the last round of cullings.
as a result of this early awakening, several worlds have been driven to the point of extinction
their survivors scattered, their civilizations lost forever.
we're out there fighting the waith, day after day, putting our asses on the line.
but the fact remains, many who have been killed would be alive today if you had never come here.
isn't that true? - That's it, I'm not playing in this game anymore.
this is just the first of many charges.
if you refuse to participate, it'll be taken as an admission of guilt on all counts, and we will have no choice but to proceed to sentencing.
what are you going to do? Put everybody in Atlantis in jail?
obviously that's not possible.
however, we can refuse cooperation.
that means no more trade, no more relations of any kind.
Atlantis will be completely isolated.
no relations with the likes of you?
I think we can handle that.
the coalition grows in strength and influence every day.
soon enough, all of your current trading partners will have no choice but to join and therefore to abide by the ruling of this council.
as for you and your team, an example must be made.
justice demands it.
justice-- is that what you're calling this?
a suitable, uninhabited planet has been chosen.
if you're found guilty, you'll be sent there, without any hope of return, for the rest of your natural lives.
apparently, the planet they picked for us has just enough food for us to survive, so, technically, it's not an execution.
great.
and they took the DHD, so whoever comes through the gate
they're not coming back.
the Daedalus can find us.
if they had the address.
short of that, they'd need to search every solar system in the galaxy for a habitable planet, which would take, what, a million years?
right. Let's not panic.
I've been to the chamber a couple of times now.
I'm beginning to get a sense of the layout.
the architecture is definitely different from that of the village.
no, we're on another planet.
judging by the fact there's no natural light or windows,
I'm guessing an underground bunker.
guards?
Yeah. Half a dozen or so.
we're going to have to see if they change in shifts.
any chance you could just convince them that we're not guilty?
cause we're not, right?
Oh, come on, there is no way the pegasus galaxy would be better off if we'd never come here.
no.
but since your arrival, there have been setbacks.
lives have been lost.
but there is hope now where once there was none.
look, as much as I'd like to tell these guys where to put their little trial, we'll just have to play along for a while until we figure out how to get out of here.
Mr. Woolsey, this is Myrus.
he claims to be a representative for the new coalition of planets.
does he?
are you the leader of Atlantis?
that's right.
then we need to speak.
well, what's next on the agenda?
did we step on the rose bushes on our last trip to Vedeena?
perhaps you've heard of a plague that's recently swept through several worlds, a sickness that arrives suddenly, runs its course in a matter of days, and typically kills one out of every three men, women, and children wherever it strikes.
there are those who believe it is not a sickness at all but a deliberate poisoning, the work of one individual.
I know who you're talking about. His name is Michael.
it is said that he is neither human nor waith, but some kind of half-breed.
can you explain to us how such a thing is possible?
one of our people was conducting research.
they were trying to come up with a way to solve the waith problem once and for all.
you found a way to convert waith into humans?
don't ask me the medical questions. I'm not a doctor.
and this Michael was one of your test subjects?
as a matter of fact, he was the first.
blood pressure's fine, pulse normal. You're bouncing back quite nicely.
bouncing back from what?
Hello, Michael.
do you remember me?
no.
I'm Dr. Elizabeth Weir.
this is Lt. Colonel John Sheppard.
you served under my command.
your name is lieutenant Michael Kenmore.
you're in a private room off the infirmary here in Atlantis.
is that familiar to you?
Yeah.
I think.
we tried to convince him he was one of us.
but he knew something was wrong, and then he found proof.
five milligrams!
release me!
you will die for this!
others will come for me!
they will- blah blah blah.
they've got to find us first.
you're going to need a name.
how does "mike" sound?
after that, he escaped.
he went back and forth between waith and human a couple more times until he finally settled somewhere in between.
so once again you admit your guilt.
you unleashed this... thing on the galaxy.
we didn't just let him out the front door and forget about him.
we've been chasing him ever since.
a couple of months ago, we managed to catch up with him.
fire in the hole.
what happened?
the hyperdrive just exploded.
no, that's impossible.
main power is out across much of the ship.
an accidental overload? It doesn't appear that way.
how did they do that?
I will look into it.
Daedalus, please come in.
Colonel Sheppard, what the hell happened to your jumper?
hell, I got all turned around in the parking garage.
I was in a rush, so I borrowed this dart.
I've got the team beamed in to a storage device.
feel free to do whatever you want to that cruiser.
major Marks, please make that ship go away.
Yes, sir.
are you sure he was killed?
the ship was vaporized. There was no body to recover.
well, then, you cannot testify before this council, and under the eyes of the ancestors, that you know for certain that he is dead.
no.
this is outrageous.
you're telling me that one of the first official acts of your new government was to assault and kidnap my people?
they weren't assaulted. They were arrested.
you've got to be kidding me.
believe me, not all of us agreed with this decision, but it wasn't taken entirely without reason.
we've been trying to help you people.
what you've been doing is making unilateral decisions that affect the lives of millions, without consultation and without accountability.
this is no longer acceptable.
I'm not going to get drawn into a debate here.
I only need to know one thing
where are my people being held?
of course I can't tell you that.
fair trials don't take place in secret locations.
nevertheless
I think Mr. Myrus needs a little time to reconsider his position here.
escort him to a cell.
my pleasure.
you're making a mistake.
am I?
when I was chosen to deliver this message, I knew there was a chance I wouldn't be coming back.
but if you detain me, you will only be confirming what many already suspect
that you're a rogue element in this galaxy, operating without restraint or due process.
lock him up.
let's go.
all right.
I'm not saying we haven't made some mistakes, but that's 'cause we're the only ones out there fighting.
nobody else is out there taking on the waith.
but isn't that your own fault as well?
what are you talking about?
the genii had a plan to combat the waith, but they were thwarted when you betrayed them.
Oh, is that what they told you? Because that's not what I remember.
Where's my father?
he did not survive.
how?
what happened?
I think we should find out.
take aim!
I thought we were just learning how to get along.
she killed Tyrus.
no.
by leaving him to die, you may just as well have killed him yourself.
we will keep this intelligence information and your ship, and whatever quantities of C4 you have in your possession.
that is all you ever intended-- to use us.
your weapons.
no.
I don't think so.
this is what your father died for?
in the name of people who would lie and steal from those they would call friends?
well, I lied too.
jumpers two and three, execute.
did you really think we had one ship?
so you betrayed each other.
we came prepared.
they made the first move.
look, the genii plan was never going to work anyways.
they had bombs they couldn't finish without our help, they had no methods of delivery.
if you want a military victory against the waith, we're your only chance.
you've been in touch with our off-world contacts?
Yes, sir.
And?
nobody knows anything.
at least, that's what they're saying.
you don't believe them?
well, frankly, right now, I don't know what to believe, sir.
these people are supposed to be our friends, but if we can't just walk into an ordinary village without worrying about an ambush, what's the point?
we're not there yet.
I refuse to believe that the whole galaxy has turned against us.
well, it might as well, because right now we have nothing.
maybe not...
come with me.
open it.
Mr. Myrus, I have a proposal for you.
so you claim to have had military success against the waith?
we've done our share of damage. Even managed to take a few hive ships out here and there.
Really?
and how did you manage to accomplish this remarkable feat?
well, I can tell you one thing-- it's never easy, but one good trick is to get them to shoot at each other.
look. See that?
it's a dart firing at one of the hive ships.
Why?
Sheppard's actually getting them to fire at each other.
now, if two hive ships are going at it and you happen to be onboard one of them, that can be a bit of a problem.
that's when you have to improvise.
Teyla, Lorne, come in.
Colonel, where are you? - We're on our way.
you must hurry. The other hive has found us.
can you hold 'em off?
not for long.
approaching dart bay.
acknowledged.
they're inside.
Colonel, request permission to jump to hyperspace immediately.
negative. I have another idea.
Teyla, I want you to set a new course.
commander.
what is it?
we just received an urgent communication from the hive.
the enemy-- they're headed straight for us.
did I also mention that we have a fair amount of ancient technology at our disposal, because that can be pretty handy too.
there's a hive bearing down on your position.
Yes, sir, I see that.
stand by.
doc, they're killing us here. - I have it, I have it.
firing drones.
let's see, what else did I leave out?
there's been so many over the years, you know, it's hard to keep track.
enough.
you spin a colorful tale, Colonel.
that much is obvious.
yet for all these fantastic claims, we have no evidence but your word.
this trial is evidence.
your precious little coalition wouldn't even exist if we hadn't have pushed the waith so far back that you got an opportunity you haven't had in 10, 000 years.
your responsibility in this has already been determined.
you woke the waith early, before the population of this galaxy had sufficient time to recover, which eventually led to the waith going to war with each other over feeding grounds.
that war is what has given us this opportunity, not some imagined victory on your part.
we will take a recess.
please take the prisoner back to his cell.
Woolsey, what the hell are you doing here?
I've made an arrangement with your captors.
I'm taking over your defense.
suppose you managed to bring along a subspace locator beacon, did you?
that's waith technology.
it's not like we have one just lying around.
I even tried to contact Todd to see if we could borrow one, but he never responded.
what about the DHD on the planet we were ambushed?
you could pull the most recent addresses that were dialed.
already done. There were over 50 addresses in the buffer.
I almost cleaned out the entire city sending people to investigate all of them, but they turned up nothing.
so it would seem.
this was obviously very well thought out.
they had a very clever plan, but we're smarter and better armed.
there's got to be a way around this.
they took advantage of one significant weakness
we trusted them.
look, I came here because I have a plan to get you out of here.
well, what is it?
win the trial.
look, we were just playing along to buy us enough time to figure out a way out of here.
and how's that coming along?
well, we're-- we're working on it.
I was Harvard law review.
I was Chief Counsel of the US army corps of engineers.
prior to that, I was an appellate advocate for Hartshorne & Slaughter, one of the most prestigious litigation boutiques in all New York city.
believe me,
I can handle three tribal elders with a stack of papyrus.
some time ago, a number of human worlds were attacked and destroyed from space, not by the waith, but by someone else.
little is known of this mysterious race except that they possess incredibly advanced technology, and are rumored to be allies of Atlantis.
I think I know who you're referring to, and believe me, they are not our allies.
they're called replicators.
they were created by the ancients.
if you wish to know the truth of who we are, I will show you.
the ancients, as you call them, were desperate in their search for a better way to fight the waith.
though greatly outnumbered, they relied on their technological superiority to give them a needed advantage.
instead of building bigger, more powerful weapons, they chose to build smaller ones.
nanites.
in these tiny killing machines, the ancients imbued an aggression that surpassed even that of their enemy.
the technology allowed for organic assimilation and self-replication to increase their effectiveness.
and replicate they did.
they grew in numbers, evolving at a rate that took the ancients by surprise.
the molecular machines began interlocking, assembling themselves to form even more complex organisms, eventually evolving into the most effective and efficient form they knew of.
this is how we were born.
when the ancients concluded that we would never become the weapon they desired to create, they decided to end it.
so they chose to destroy us, to leave no trace of us behind.
some of them managed to survive.
that's right.
and as the name suggests, they replicated and rebuilt themselves into a powerful force.
Oh... my...
no kidding.
but why would they attack human worlds?
it was a strategy they developed in their campaign against the waith
eliminate the enemy's food supply.
there's one thing I don't understand, Mr. Woolsey.
if, as you suggest, they were originally designed to fight the waith, why did they wait until now?
I got the ZPM. We're leaving.
wait a minute. We can't go.
what are you talking about? You said you could get the hyperdrive back online.
I mean, we can, but not yet. Look, while Elizabeth's been connected, I've been going over the replicators' base code, and I found this.
what is that?
the holy grail.
it's their whole reason for being.
it's a command code that directs them to attack the waith.
Yeah, but they don't attack the waith.
they've been sitting on their nanite asses for 10,000 years.
that's because it's been deactivated.
are you telling us that you are the ones that activated the attack code?
we didn't know they were going to target human worlds.
no, because you acted rashly, without considering the consequences.
we had an opportunity, one that wasn't going to present itself again.
believe me, councilors, this decision was not taken lightly.
in fact, it cost us one of our best people.
get to the jumper.
you're coming with us.
I can't keep them frozen much longer.
we're not leaving you behind.
if you don't leave right now, none of us will get out of here, so go!
that's an order!
come on!
Elizabeth! - Go!
one of your people died, and you consider this a grave sacrifice?
as a matter of fact, I do.
then imagine how we feel
those of us who have witnessed the deaths of thousands.
we cannot be held responsible for the actions of the replicators.
Colonel Sheppard made the same argument in respect to the waith, and in that case I might be inclined to agree with him.
by your own admission, these replicators are machines.
so if I were to set a detonator, can I then later deny responsibility for the actions of the bomb?
by that logic, you might just as well blame the ancients.
they created them.
the ancients, as you call them, are not here to answer for their actions.
you are.
we know for certain of six human worlds that were destroyed by the replicators.
but we also know of at least a dozen hive ships that were destroyed, hive ships that would almost certainly have culled within a year.
one could make the argument that, on balance, more lives were saved than were lost.
on balance?
is that what we are to you?
figures on a ledger?
pieces that can be moved about in a game of strategy, some to be saved while others are sacrificed?
I'm sorry, I certainly didn't mean to diminish - real people are being killed, Mr. Woolsey, real villages destroyed
my village, my people.
my husband and children-- murdered before my eyes.
you're from one of the planets destroyed by the replicators.
I barely escaped with my life, but not before I saw everything I hold dear get wiped out by a beam of light from the sky.
and I will not rest until someone is made to pay for it.
well, I guess we can rule out getting her vote.
it's clearly inappropriate for someone that biased to be on the council.
so they stacked the deck against us.
I'm not sure.
Dimas seems to be a reasonable man.
I think he might even be persuaded to vote our way.
kelore is a little harder to read.
Yeah, he seemed pretty hostile to me.
didn't you say he was from Latira?
Yeah, that's right.
one of our last intelligence reports suggests a growing relationship between Latira and the genii.
Yeah, he did try to convince me that they should be the ones leading the fight against the waith.
you think the genii are behind this?
it makes sense.
apart from Atlantis, they're clearly the biggest military power in the coalition.
if they played their cards right, they could wind up running the whole thing.
but only with us out of the picture.
so we were right all along. This whole thing's fixed.
I say we go to plan B
wait for the guards come in, I beat 'em up, take their guns, we shoot our way out of here.
do we even know the way out?
we know we're at least two levels underground and there's no more than a dozen or so guards at any one time.
what about on the surface? How many guards are up there?
and which way is the gate? And how far?
there's a few things we'll have to figure out along the way.
it's too risky.
we could wind up being shot before we even got out of the building.
what other choice do we have? We know we can't win this thing.
what are you talking about?
I'm saying now that I know what the game is, I can play it.
thank you for agreeing to meet me.
wait outside.
it cost me rather a fine pocketwatch that used to belong to my father to get him to bring me here.
you shouldn't have bothered.
there's nothing I can do for you.
well, maybe I'm just feeling generous tonight.
speak plainly.
you're backing the wrong horse.
we know you're connected with the genii.
I don't know what you're talking about.
we also know they're looking to become the military muscle behind the coalition.
we think we'd make a better choice.
you?
that's right.
well, I didn't realize you had those kinds of ambitions.
we've been content to keep to ourselves up until now, but if it's a choice between getting pushed out of the game and taking a more active part, well, that's no choice at all, is it?
of course, for appearance's sake, we can't be too aggressive, so we'll need someone on the inside to help push our agenda...
someone to whom we'll be very, very grateful.
and how do I know you haven't made this offer to the others?
I think we both know Dimas will only be swayed by reason, and Shiana's going to vote against us, no matter what.
that leaves you.
Mr. Woolsey, are you ready to face the final charge?
I am.
the people of Atlantis stand accused of conspiring with the waith.
conspiring?
we have reports that Atlantis has negotiated with the waith and performed military operations with them.
it is said you have formed an alliance with one waith in particular.
that's what we call him.
this waith was imprisoned with Colonel Sheppard by the genii.
the waith was allowed to feed on him but, despite this, Colonel Sheppard realized that their best chance of escape was to work together.
which way?
this way.
and you continue to have dealings with this waith?
we have... occasional contact.
you trust him?
of course not.
but he has proven to be useful at times.
he helped us hold off the replicator fleet long enough for Dr. Mckay to enact a plan to destroy them.
interior suction.
transferring power from non-critical systems to hull regeneration.
our shields can't take much more of this, sir.
hopefully, they won't have to.
and get ready to transfer power from the beam weapons to the
what the hell?
son of a bitch.
he actually did it.
we need to get out of here. - Right. Let's go. Come on!
as much as I'd love to, we shouldn't stick around and watch this go down.
we should tell the fleet to jump to the rendezvous point immediately.
the planet's become unstable.
the fact is we would never have defeated the replicators without his help.
I think it's safe to say they would have continued their policy of attacking human worlds and, by now, everyone in this galaxy would be dead.
very well.
as that was the final charge, we will recess to deliberate.
I'd like to make one final statement, if I may.
very well.
the waith are in disarray, but that won't last forever.
sooner or later, one faction will win out over the others.
and when that happens, they will turn their attention to this coalition with a ruthless vengeance, the likes of which you've never seen.
if you don't want us there when that day comes, fighting by your side, then, by all means, vote us guilty.
I need no deliberation.
I say we get this over with now.
very well.
I vote guilty, on all charges.
I vote not guilty on all charges.
it falls to you, Kelore.
yours is the deciding vote.
well? What's the word?
not guilty.
Oh, thank god.
we're free to go.
I never doubted you for a second.
whoo, nice suit.
being back in the courtroom made me miss my old uniform.
you're kidding.
not the job, just the uniform.
Oh, that's nice.
well, it seemed appropriate.
so, you going to tell me how you managed to pull this one off?
well, I'd say it was a combination of things
my legal skills, my eloquence, the indisputable logic of my arguments, and the bribe I offered Kelore.
on top of that,
I had to commit Atlantis to a much larger day-to-day participation in the politics of the pegasus galaxy.
a way to explain that in my report...
yeah...
well, what's the point of being out here if we don't try to make a difference, right?
let's hope the IOA agrees with you.
let's worry about that later. For now, congratulations.
Thanks.
you wanted to see me?
may I ask why you have not filed a single mission report since I assumed command of this base?
cause I haven't given you any?
as you know, one of the changes I made around here is to require every team member to file mission reports, as opposed to only team leaders and science officers.
really.
I didn't-- I didn't know that.
I announced it my fourth day here, at an away-team orientation meeting detailing changes to mission protocol.
was I there?
Yes. It was mandatory.
because I don't remember-- - I saw you there.
it's kind of hard to miss you.
look, my point is I want you to file a report every mission.
I'm not good at writing.
I figured you might say that.
use this.
it's a digital voice recorder.
speak into it, we'll plug it in, and your report will be automatically transcribed and filed with the others.
I'm not good at talking, either.
Oh, I'm sorry.
too fast for you, buddy boy?
nursing home just called, rodney. They want their scooter back.
scooter? That is a tri-cell li-po pack under my hood, son.
Hey! Ooh, sorry. My bad.
Yeah, I will trample you.
well, don't trip on your skirt.
you okay?
I could have dropped him!
sorry, we didn't know anyone was around. You sure you're all right?
come to think of it, what are you doing down here anyway?
trying to get torren to sleep.
I find that walking him is the best way to calm him.
Ooh, he's colicky, huh?
Dr. Keller says it's a phase that will pass.
Oh, don't worry about it. I was a colicky baby too.
just do what my mom did, which was let me cry myself to sleep.
I'm no worse for it.
anyway...
we usually take turns walking him, but kanaan is away visiting our people for a few days.
I'd help you out, but it looks like you've got everything taken care of.
Yes.
now all I have to do is get him back to my quarters without waking him...
or being run over.
Yeah, we're done here.
we're just, you know, finishing up, really, so...
night. - 'Night. Good one.
go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
I must have put too much strain on the motor.
shaft needs a bushing lube.
what?
what's that about?
beats me.
come in.
control room, it's dr. Mckay. We just lost power in the east pier. What's going on?
that's strange.
lights are out all over the city except the control room.
why is that?
this is dr. Rodney mckay, calling anyone in the control room. Please respond.
something's definitely not right.
the Prodigal
Rodney, are you there?
Colonel sheppard?
everything's dead. There's no way of knowing what the hell's going on.
all right. Hey, rivers.
fan out, find as many marines as you can, work your way up to the central tower.
if you run into woolsey, let me know.
communications are down. We're on walkies.
Rodney, what's going on?
what, you don't know either?
I'm on my way to the control tower. I tried to radio you.
power's out except for the central tower.
go to the main power room instead.
see if you can reboot the system from there.
okay. All right.
Hello?
Rodney, do you read me?
Yeah, radek. Go ahead.
I've tried to restart power. So far, absolutely no success.
what about the zpm?
I've checked it, as well as the naquadah generator.
neither are online.
someone must have disabled them from the control room.
if that was the case, then they wouldn't have any power up there either.
not unless they're using an external power source.
okay, listen to me. I want you to do exactly the same thing.
initiate a temporary patch using an external power source
one of the auxiliary battery units.
Yes, but that won't be enough to power the entire city, not by a long shot.
don't worry about that. Just get me enough juice to access the mainframe.
we can figure out what the hell's going on up there.
all right.
whereabouts are you right now?
level 36?
35
Oh, great.
35, perfect.
so just another 28 floors to go, and that's just this stairwell.
and then we get to level 63, got to cross over to an ancillary stairwell, climb another four levels
that's just to access the gate room...
Ooh, you know, see if you can route some of that power to the transporters while you're at it.
all right, I'll try.
Hey.
this door leads to the gate room stairwell, right?
Yeah.
well, maybe the door was already closed when we lost power.
it was sealed on purpose to keep people out.
what, you think someone's infiltrated atlantis?
talk to me.
I've initiated a temporary patch.
I was able to route partial power to your lab.
well, what about the transporters?
still working on it.
Yeah, well, let me know when you've got one online.
go to your lab and try to tap into the mainframe.
I'll try the other stairwells. They're probably blocked too, but who knows.
maybe there's another way up.
all right.
Colonel.
that one sealed too?
Yeah, all the stairwell doors are.
been trying to find a way up to the gate room since the power went out.
Yeah, so have we.
any idea what's going on yet?
McKay's still working on it.
I guess we could blow the door with c-4.
Yeah, we probably will, but we're not there yet.
I need to know what we're up against before we go storming up there.
any luck?
not much.
you're right, though. Someone's taken over atlantis.
they hacked into the mainframe.
I'm having a hard time accessing several of the critical systems.
and the ones that I can access are read-only.
Hey, what're you... how did you get up here so fast?
Oh, I was able to get some of the transporters back online again.
what about the transporter on the gate room level?
no, sadly, no.
there's a lockout code in place on that one.
surveillance cameras.
we've got closed-circuit feeds on the control room and the gate room.
if you're not locked out of those as well.
they're not critical systems. I should be able to access them if...
got it.
a puddle jumper?
who is that?
it's definitely not atlantis personnel.
can you get a feed on woolsey's office?
Yeah, hang on.
Oh, my god.
is that...?
Yeah.
Hello, teyla.
how did you get here?
the ship I borrowed from your people.
it has provided me with a wealth of information and technology and the key to infiltrating this base.
use this.
it's a digital voice recorder.
speak into it, we'll plug it in, and your report will be automatically transcribed and filed with the others.
I'm not good at talking, either.
unscheduled off-world activation.
is the shield raised?
Yes, sir.
major nelson's idc.
they're early.
not due back until tomorrow.
all right, let them in.
it's not going up to the jumper bay.
what's wrong?
major nelson, what's your status?
what is that?
get everybody out of here.
get 'em out now!
closing all immediate access doors.
I've activated the portal's shield.
good.
what about the external power interface?
we're connected.
the control room level is now drawing power directly from the ship.
is the stun field holding?
Yes.
two levels above and below us are protected.
now we can get to work.
get to work on what?
forgive me.
I forgot to congratulate you.
what's his name?
no matter.
we don't have much time, I'm afraid.
my hybrids are preparing to activate atlantis' self-destruct device.
as soon as they do that, we will leave.
you're going to destroy atlantis?
a punishment richly deserved.
not that I expect you to agree with me.
but don't worry.
your baby will be safe.
you are not taking my son.
Yes, teyla.
I am.
you know how important your child is to me.
his father and you have given him a powerful gift that I will utilize to exert greater control over my legion of hybrids.
he is the key to increasing my strength, securing my reign over the galaxy.
your "reign" is over.
you will not make it out of here alive. My people will make certain
enough! Enough.
you think you've weakened me.
you've destroyed my facilities, ruined much of my research, but you cannot-- you cannot-- weaken my resolve.
make no mistake, teyla.
I am as strong now as I have ever been.
look around you.
I am in control of atlantis, the very place where your people ended my life as I knew it.
it's only fitting that I return to extinguish this blight from the galaxy once and for all.
I thought michael was dead.
as did I.
I mean, we blew up his ship, right?
he's the one who stole our jumper, used it to escape from his cruiser before we could destroy it.
he's like a cockroach.
every time you try to step on him, he just skitters away.
all right, we need to get moving.
you and your team take this stairwell.
my team will take this stairwell. We move into position.
you wait for my mark to blast the door.
we head up, retake the gate room.
McKay, you're with me. Zelenka, stay here, try to figure this thing out.
certainly.
we're giving michael no quarter.
if you get a shot at him, take it.
make sure he's dead.
let's move.
I must speak with you.
we are still having difficulty with the self-destruct device.
Why?
as I told you, the encryption is much more complex than we had anticipated.
we have run several integer factorization algorithms.
nothing has worked so far.
keep at it.
for how long?
as long as it takes.
it is only a matter of time before the others figure out a way through our defenses.
I know.
but you will have solved the encryption problem before then.
we have the baby.
we don't have to remain here.
we are not leaving until that device is armed.
problems?
nothing that can't be dealt with.
you do know that colonel sheppard is no doubt preparing strike teams to retake the gate room.
of course, probably moving them into place as we speak.
don't worry.
they're not getting in here.
major, what's your status?
C-4 is in place, colonel.
ready when you are.
fire in the hole.
on my mark.
three, two, one, mark.
move!
whoa, whoa, we're picking up a serious energy reading up ahead.
what is it? - I don't know, but we should stop until I do.
major lorne, hold up.
Colonel sheppard, major lorne is down.
what happened? - I don't know.
I think he hit some kind of force field.
he's alive, but unconscious.
get him out of there and fall back.
looks like he's got himself a force field.
he's nothing if not annoyingly industrious.
all right, what do we do?
well, we disable it. - How?
we-- we-- good question.
I've Been examiningthe energy reading we picked up, and it appears that michael has somehow managed to modify the wraith stun-pulse technology and integrate it with the puddle jumper cloaking mechanism
creating a kind of "stun-bubble
no, a force field around the control room and the gate room.
look, while it's in place, we're not getting in there.
well, I know that. What you haven't told me is how we're gonna turn it off.
because we haven't figured that out yet.
look, it's going to be very tricky.
Yeah, you see, michael is using the puddle jumper as an external power source, not only for the control room and the gate room, but also, he's using it to power the stun-bubble
okay, enough with the "stun-bubble.
that's an accurate description--- no, it's a stupid description
guys, guys...
look, the point is that if we want to disable the stun
the force field, then we first need to disable the power from the jumper.
or we figure out a way to override the mainframe lockouts that michael has in place.
all right, how's that going?
it's not. Not yet.
keep working on it.
I'm going to check on lorne.
Hey.
what happened?
that puddle jumper that came through...
it sent out some kind of stun wave, knocked everybody out.
all of atlantis?
I don't know. Probably.
don't worry, they'll wake up soon.
everyone has a different level of resistance.
here.
who would do this?
I don't know. That's what I want to find out.
can you open that door?
I think so.
good. Do it.
still nothing.
there was a time you understood me, teyla.
when your people brought me here, gave me the retrovirus that turned me into a human, you alone showed me compassion.
you were the voice of conscience.
I've given this a great deal of thought. I've...
I'm willing to return the favor.
I would very much like for you to come with me.
you can care for your child, and I will care for the both of you.
I would rather die.
I promise...
I will not harm either of you.
you have to believe me.
I can not trust the word of a murderer.
why can't you understand?
I have become what I am out of necessity, the need to survive!
you became what you are out of vengeance.
do you not punish criminals in your world?
are they not brought to justice?
is this justice to you?
killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people across this galaxy?
they would not be dead had you not made me the subject of your vicious experiment!
their blood is on your hands!
it's your choice. You can come with me and live, or remain here and die.
either way, I'm taking your child.
we need to blow up the jumper.
if we blow it up, we cut the power and disable the force field, right?
great plan
I'm just not entirely clear on how you intend on doing the actual blowing up.
fire a drone at it.
we can't.
the chair room requires far more power than the auxiliary battery units can provide.
I was barely able to bring enough power into this lab, let alone the few transporters I could bring online.
all right, then, we'll take a jumper.
again, I come back to my question of how?
we have no way of getting to the jumper bay.
we'll take one from the underwater bay.
fly it up to the tower, fire a drone through the window, and take out michael's jumper.
what?
uh, no, no, no, that's a good plan, except I see one small problem
the underwater jumper bay only has a couple of jumpers in it.
well, we only need one.
Yes, well, the thing is--- both of them were severely damaged in the flood.
neither of them is able to fly.
that was two years ago, radek. Mckay already fixed them.
Oh, you've got to be kidding me...
it was the next thing on my list.
you said you were going to fix them.
I know, and I was getting to it, I swear.
and you had two years!
I was busy!
perhaps we should go and see if we can fix one of them.
that's a good idea, but I want you stay here to try to override michael's lockouts.
why don't I stay here and work on that?
Zelenka can go with you to the jumper bay.
because I want you to come with me and fix those jumpers like you said you were going to do two years ago.
let's go.
please tell me there's a transporter.
Yes. Well, not by the jumper bay, but there's one two levels down.
that'll do.
nice.
you can fight.
five years of kick-boxing.
that's good to know.
what happened?
it's michael and his hybrids.
I counted three of 'em.
I'm not sure how many more there are.
probably not too many-- they all had to fit in that jumper.
unless more came through on foot afterward.
what do we do?
try to get to the armory, come back and retake the gate room.
sounds like a plan.
you two, come with us.
banks, stay here with them, keep everyone calm.
and, uh, if any more hybrids show up, just do what you did earlier.
speak with you again. It's urgent.
stay with him.
what is it?
we were finally able to decipher the encryption on the self-destruct device.
good.
prepare the ship to leave.
we'll arm the self-destruct, and switch the power back to atlantis' systems a split-second before we leave.
the timing of the switch must be precise.
I don't want to give them any opportunity to disarm the device.
I'll make the calculations.
change of plans.
we're not going to the armory.
Why? What happened?
they armed the self-destruct.
Mr. Woolsey, would you please head back to the others?
Colonel sheppard, this is teyla. Can you hear me?
John, this is teyla. Please respond.
Colonel shep
Colonel sheppard. Ronon is in the control room. He's fighting with michael!
we're almost at the jumper bay. Keep us posted.
Teyla, run!
are you all right? - Yes.
but ronon needs our help. We need to get back up to the control room.
tell us what's going on up there.
I-- I can't tell. Ronon is down.
he might just be unconscious.
tell me when he comes to.
what have we got?
it's like I said-- both of the jumpers are toast.
this one's got a whole whack of problems, starting with zero power.
you said the other jumper's got power, right?
Yeah, but not much else. Drive pods won't extend, there's no drones...
this one's got drones. So if we bring power over to this, we can get drive pods working, right?
you want me to harvest parts from both jumpers, cobble together a fix so one of them will work?
is it possible? - Doubtful.
but maybe...
perfect. Get to it.
what do you need, 15 minutes?
great, just great.
must've locked out the transporters.
we need to get to the control room.
it's too dangerous. Not without weapons.
Where's the nearest stairwell?
around the corner. This way.
let me lead.
okay, give 'er.
drive pods are go.
all right, now we're getting somewhere. I got juice, I got life support, I got
Oh, come on! - What?
the weapons won't come online.
why not?
I don't know.
well, figure it out. We need those drones.
where is she?
we don't know. We searched everywhere.
are you telling me she just disappeared?
I'm saying that we searched every room and corridor within the stun field.
we couldn't find her anywhere.
she knows this city well.
she's hiding somewhere.
she's toying with me!
we'll keep looking.
no. I'll handle this.
what are you going to do?
flush her out.
that's atlantis' self-destruct.
Michael's going to blow up the city.
how much time do we have?
he set it for 10 minutes.
how much time do you need before you get those drones working?
if I can get them working at all, a lot more than 10 minutes!
all right, forget about it.
what are you-- what are you doing?
gonna fly the jumper and crash it into the tower.
crash it? - It's our best chance of taking out michael's jumper.
not to mention taking out yourself.
I have crashed jumpers into the tower before.
not like this you haven't.
look, in addition to the weapons, the inertial dampeners are out.
you'll need to impact michael's jumper with enough force to do some serious damage, which means a lot of speed when you hit that tower.
look, this is a suicide mission.
I know you can hear me.
that alarm, if you're not aware, is atlantis' self-destruct device.
I've armed it, set it for 10 minutes.
that is the amount of time you have to consider the offer I'm about to make.
if you will surrender yourself and your child to me,
I'll disarm the device, sparing the lives of everyone on this base.
if not...
you, your baby, and everyone else will die.
okay, you're good to go.
make sure that strike team is ready to move as soon as that field drops.
I will. Don't accelerate too fast coming out of the jumper bay.
if you hit the gas too hard, you're going to flatten like a pancake.
right.
what?
well, it's just... what you're about to do is...
Yeah. It's not like it's the first time.
how many suicide missions have I flown?
I don't know. I lost count.
well, there you go.
all right, well, you know...
here's to many more.
Yeah, radek. Go ahead.
I've finally figured out how to override some of michael's lockout codes.
that's great. Can you shut down the self-destruct?
no. No, no, that will take a little bit more time.
I have, however, managed to get the access doors to the gate room open.
well, that does us absolutely no good.
I mean, the stun field is still in effect.
what about the transporter on the gate room level?
uh... no, no, I still don't have control of that, either.
for crying out loud--- I'm sorry, I'm doing the best I can.
michael has placed several highly encrypted codes--- look, just
what about the gate shield? Can you lower it?
Yes. That I can do.
great.
you don't have to do your kamikaze run.
why not?
just fly to the tower, get in proximity, dial the dhd to a random planet, we'll have radek lower the gate shield, allowing the vortex to obliterate michael's puddle jumper, or most of it.
now, that's a good plan.
where are you going? - You're gonna fly it.
that frees me up to lead the strike team.
you said it yourself-- it's simple enough. You just dial the gate.
I guess I can do that. - Go easy on the accelerator.
Radek, get ready to drop that shield on my mark.
we don't have much time.
we need to leave this place.
time is short, teyla.
I don't understand
I would think the choice is an easy one...
if nothing else, consider your child.
by remaining in hiding, you are sentencing him to die.
what kind of mother would do such a thing?
he has a chance to live.
both of you do.
come with me, teyla.
trust me
I will not harm either of you.
and I will not harm atlantis.
you have my word.
turn off the self-destruct system.
you want me to trust you?
then show me you mean what you say.
turn off the self-destruct system, and I will come with you.
all right, I'm in the air... approaching the central tower.
copy that.
Zelenka, you ready?
ready when you are.
Michael, can you hear me?
less than two minutes.
we need to go.
now.
Yes, teyla.
I hear you.
you disappoint me.
so I will leave you to the fate you have chosen.
but I'm not leaving alone.
you should know that I've already collected your son's dna...
cloning him will require additional time, delaying the implementation of my plan, but as you well know,
I will not be deterred.
good-bye, teyla.
what are you doing?
collecting one last prize.
I'm in position. Ready to dial.
Radek, drop the shield.
the shield's down! Go, rodney!
No!
the stun field is neutralized!
what about the self-destruct? Is it disabled?
Yes, yes. It shut off when the jumper's power was cut.
good.
I'm heading back. Go ahead and reboot the city's power.
Yes, I'm already doing it.
get a medic!
close the jumper bay doors, radek!
will you take care of torren for me?
of course.
make sure no one leaves.
how's dr. Keller's most cantankerous patient?
you've got to be kidding me.
you get released, and I gotta stay here another day?
because I only fell down a flight of stairs.
you, my friend, were hurled from a much greater height.
you're lucky you only suffered a concussion and didn't break your neck.
nothing. I'm fine.
I know you are.
but listen to the doctor.
anyway, I just wanted to drop by and commend you for your exemplary work.
your courage in the face of danger continues to amaze and, dare I say, inspire me.
Thanks.
get some rest.
and don't worry. Your team's not going anywhere without you.
that reminds me.
I know michael attacking the city isn't really a mission, but, uh,
I filed a report anyways.
Oh.
Oh.
splendid.
thank you.
mission report
michael invaded atlantis, tried to blow it up.
we stopped him. End of report.
take a good long look, 'cause soon you're going to see nothing but taillights.
nice try, speed racer.
I'm sorry.
sorry, we were just, you know...
who's winning?
I am. - I am.
still colicky, huh?
he was awake all day. Refused to take a nap.
that's not surprising. He got a full night's sleep.
Yes, it's remarkable. He slept through the entire ordeal.
he hasn't slept through a whole night in...
ever.
well, he can rest easy now, 'cause michael's finally out of the picture.
unfortunately, there will be somebody else to take his place. Of this, I am certain.
he's got super mom watching his back. If you ask me, he's in good hands.
do you want to watch me kick rodney's ass?
actually, you may want to cover the child's eyes, because this could get ugly.
are you ready?
Hey! Hey!
www. ydy. com/bbs- Proudly Presents
Nah, sgc doesn't have a zpm, so two weeks on earthmeans three weeks cooped up in the daedalus.
that's five weeks of missing work.
we only get one of those every year-and-a-half, so i'd like to save mine for something more special.
so we're going camping instead?
on a beach that's never been surfed or even touched.
you gotta get more excited about this.
Hey, check that out.
what?
think he'll ever make a move?
who cares?
say...
I know we only get 14 days on earth a year, and you miss your dad and all...
but...
see, one of my old--a guy who was doing his doctorateat the same time as me, he's giving a big secret presentationabout some new thing that he's working on, and everyone and anyone in the physics communityis going to be there.
And...well...
see, the thing is there's this perception out there that i'm, um...
like, a washout, recluse...
Why?
Well,'cause i do this for a living.
I mean, super double tip-top secret stuff.
I mean, I haven't published a paperin nearly a decade
not one that can be read by the general public
and I'm kind of hard to get ahold of, what with living in another galaxy and all.
Yeah, I know what that's like.
exactly. they think I'm a shut-in.
so...
I was thinking...
that if I was to,say,show up with a woman...
a-- a beautiful woman...
that they wouldn't maybe--not think that I was...
like, a complete loser.
like, it would be one day, the first night we were there, and then you could be off to Chippewa falls.
I mean, it could be fun.
well, let's see--a room full of physicists, a long-winded presentationi probably won't understand...
Yeah, doesn't really sound like fun.
well, there'll be drinks, probably, and maybe those little sandwiches...
And...me.
I'll be there.
you don't have to fabricate all these reasonson why you need me to be with you.
you could just ask me out on a date.
Hey, I didn't want to--i mean, i know you
I'll probably say yes.
well, you...want to go to this thing with me?
sure.
I'd love to.
well, I'd love-- I mean, that's--good.
good. great. that's
it's a date.
it's a date.
so what's the presentation?
I don't know.
he doesn't want to tell anyone until we all get there, but if I know this guy, it'll be, uh, you know, first-class presentation...
with, like, second-rate science.
probably some minor adjustment to someone else's work, but the food'll be good.
and the company.
Malcolm, have you read this?
Yes.
your staff thinks it's recklessto turn this thing on tomorrow.
some of my staff...
they're just getting cold feet, that's all.
do you remember all that stuff that came outbefore cern turned on the lhc?
you know, miniature black holes, exotic particles, strangelets, the instantaneous destruction of the planet?
all unfounded histrionics.
we are going to be just fine.
so you're sayingnone of these potential catastrophes will happen?
well, there is always the slight possibilitythat something might go wrong.
the cause has a lot riding on this.
don't worry about it. your precious "cause"will come out of this squeaky clean tomorrow.
some of these worst-case scenariosare terrifying
of course they're terrifying--they're worst-case scenarios!
they are the worst possible thingthat could ever happen, ever.
tomorrow will come off without a hitch.
we've done hundreds of tests.
there is zero possibility for failure.
trust me.
brain Strom this is exciting.
well, it's just a plane.
Yeah, but I've never even flown first class.
this is amazing.
have you tried these strawberries?
when I was 10, I ate a bowl full of strawberriesand threw up.
I haven't been able to stomach them since.
how does this guy afford all this?
I thought he was just a physicist.
well, he was always ableto dupe guys with deep pockets into backing his research.
it's amazing what a nice smile and a power point presentationwill get you.
well, I am impressed.
Yes, I can see that.
Oh, come on. you should be happy for your friend's success.
well, it's more of an acquaintancethan a friend.
acquaintances don't pick you up in private planes.
he didn't send the jet to be nice.
he sent the jet to rub it in my face.
I was always one step ahead of this guyduring school, and now that we're in the "real world,"
he wants to show me that, as far as most of the planet is concerned, he's a lot more successful than i am.
and what is with the evening attire?
I mean, we're going to a science talk, for god's sake.
who the hell does he think he is?
is this what the whole day will be like?
are you going to be in a bad mood?
no.
cause we're back on earth on a private jet, drinking expensive champagne, and your date's wearing a fancy dress.
most people would be having a good time, Rodney.
you're right.
you're right...
Dr. Rodney Mckay.
Dr. Jennifer Keller.
Yes. welcome.
I'll just need you both to sign this non-disclosure and confidentiality agreement.
you're not serious.
is there a problem, sir?
this whole thing is a confidentiality agreement?
Yes, sir.
what could they possibly be doing back therethat needs to be kept 200 pages secret?
if you want to go inside, sir, you need to sign the agreement.
dinosaurs?
excuse me?
do they have living dinosaurs back there?
because I'll sign thisif he's brought dinosaurs back to life.
but short of that, he is out of his mindif he thinks that i am going to pretend that whatever discovery he's made is so important and so secret that i have to sign the unabridged worksof william shakespeare here.
just sign it.
here you go.
you're just lucky the lady's here, aren't you?
where do you think we are?
I don't know. Arizona? Nevada?
I didn't thinkpeople even built secret facilities anymore.
it seems so 1950s.
I had it on good authority that you were dead.
Oh, ha ha.
and this would be your...sister?
no, no, Neil.
she's not my sister.
this is Jennifer Keller.
that's Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse Tyson.
you know, from television.
Yeah, uh-- of course.
very nice to meet you.
no, pleasure's mine.
and she's taken, neil.
no, no, I didn't mean it that way
Neil likes to steal things from me, things like women and theoretical physics ideas.
Yeah, but who hasn't stolen an ideafrom the great Rodney Mckay?
Oh, so we admit it now.
see, back in the day, whenever any one of these people came up with a new ideaor published a new paper, dr.
McKay here would swearthat he was already working on something very similar, just hadn't gotten around to publishing it yet.
he'd say things like,"I was about to say that very same thing,"or,
I was just about to havethat same idea.
at least I didn't declassify pluto from planet status.
way to make all the little kids cry, Neil.
that make you feel like a big man?
see, thanks to dr. Tyson, pluto is now the first of the plutoids, a new class of celestial object. It's cool.
come on, Rodney. It's the 21st century.
actually, come to think of it, when was the last time you even published a paper?
the '80s?
it hasn't been that long.
I think I was listening to that band a flock of seagulls while i was reading it.
actually, it might have been pre-reagan.
well, it has been great running into you guys.
we should maybe get our seats.
Bye.
they can't possibly be dating.
I know.
well, you're married, so...
dibs.
she's all yours.
I think maybe this was a bad idea.
Why?
well, I just rememberedi don't really like these people.
is it that you don't like them, or maybe they don't like you?
possibly. i mean, i used to be a little...Abrasive?
Oh, used to be.
it's hard to explain.
my field is very competive.
Yeah, I went to med schoolfor six years.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
right.
not everythinghas to be a competition, rodney.
they know how smart you are.
I'm not sure they do.
of course they do.
you don't have to keep reminding them.
it's called being humble.
have you heard that word before?
look, we're on our first dateand i've come to a physics talk, okay?
you have to bend a little bit too.
humble, eh?
I'll guess I can try anything once.
Earth...our home,our planet,the very vessel of life.
our world-- unique, irreplaceable.
and yet, at times, it seems like we are unrelentingin our quest to drive our ecosystem into catastrophic failure.
gone unchecked, global warming will transform this lush world we know today into a lifeless and arid rock.
friends, the stakes couldn't be higher, the situation no more dire.
it's time...to act.
hello.
I'm Malcolm Tunney.
if he's so worried about global warming, why did he fly us here on a private jet that spews out more co2 than sweden?
thank you very much.
very kind.
as many of you know, I am not an environmental scientist, nor do I pretend to be one.
for instance, I shower regularly.
no offense, Larry.
I'm just a concerned citizen, one who realizes that the earth has carried us for so long, maybe it's time that we carried her.
that ratio would be accurateif his body was the size of his ego.
Yeah, it's a little much.
solving a problem like global warmingmay seem impossibly complex.
so many nations, so many corporations, and John Q. publicwill have to agree on a dizzying number of issues.
so, then, what can one person really do to make a difference?
what can I, with my particular and unique skill set, do to help?
they think you're the arrogant one?
I've been working on a number of projectsover the last decade, and I realized that, if I were to combine them, I just may be able to achieve something unexpected...
so, ladies and gentlemen, with major fundingfrom my friends at kramer innovations, i have been able to devise a meansto cool our planet in a safe and controlled way.
this guy wouldn't know cool
now, the science behind this is immensely complex, but there will be detailed briefshanded out to youas you leave the lecture hall, but for right now, let me just give you the cliffs notes.
it begins with a massive heat-sink, one of my own design, which steadily draws heatfrom the surrounding environment.
but where does the heat go?
where does that heat go, you may ask.
well, my friends, that is the hard part.
I give you the tunney space-time matter bridge.
wait. what?
now, this isn't just some theoretical math proof.
this is a functioning piece of technology, one that literally moves heat from our space time and vents it out into another space time.
that's my bridge...
my sister and I came up with that.
sorry.
and it works.
we've been testing the system for a few months now, and it has proved to be remarkably stable.
that's my idea!
Rodney, now is not the time.
for the purposes of the demonstration today, I've surrounded this facilitywith an electrified plasma grid that will contain the reach of the heat-sink.
it will draw heat only from this facility.
wait, he's going to turn it onwith us here.
that's-- this is a bad idea.
Rodney, please. -and to prove the effectiveness of this system, I will lower the temperature within this facilityby 10 degrees.
Oh, and don't worry, I've turned off the air conditioning, so there'll be no cheating, I promise.
I'm sorry, I can't let him do this----excuse me! -no, rodney malcolm...
Dr. mckay.
thank you for coming.
this is a bad idea.
well, we're not quite ready for the q&a session yet, so if you could just wait till then
let's just take a look at the data you've come up withand talk about this, because turning the device on with all these people herecould be very dangerous.
respectfully, I disagree.
wh-- you can't do something like thiswithout our consent.
sit down!
you did sign the document when you entered, didn't you?
well, yeah, I thought that was just-- -then i have your consent.
Yeah, but--look, I've been doing workthat is very, very similar to this
Really?
I don't think that's possible.
look, these bridges to other space timescan be very unpredictable.
do you have any researchyou'd like to put forward right now?
a paper, perhaps?
anything to back up your claim?
Rodney, please. tell me this isn't just petty jealously.
okay.
well, no, no, I-- I just
no, I didn't think so.
don't worry, everyone. this is completely safe.
and...
we're up and running.
now, I'll be happy to answer all of your questionsonce you've had a chance to read the brief, but for now, why don't we all go back out to the lobbywhere hot coa is waiting, 'cause it's about to get very cold in here.
thank you.
I-- -come on.
let's go get some hot chocolate, okay?
this is...
how did he even get ahold of my work?
you're sure this is your work?
Absolutely. look, you believe me, don't you?
of course i do.
there is no way that he came up with thison his own.
we've got to-- we've got to--we...
come on.
we shouldn't be in here.
okay, just stand guard there.
Why? -it'll take me a couple of secondsto hack into his computer.
what are you doing?
thank you.
thank you, but I don't thinkan achievement of this magnitudecan truly be credited to one man.
Dr. Tunney, sir.
Oh, excuse me.
yes? what is it?
well, you told us to shut the device downonce we reached 64.
Yes, that's right. we can shut it down now.
well, that's the problem, sir.
we've tried. we've tried everything, in fact.
the device won't shut off.
I'm sorry, could you just give me a moment here?
let me in here.
all right, now, who's been in here?
just us, sir.
what is it?
well, the bridge won't deactivate.
I don't understand why it shouldn't.
shut down the power to the facility.
uh, that won't do anything.
the system self-generates its own poweronce it's up and running.
then shut down the containment field.
we need to get these guests out of here.
that won't work either.
why not? -why not?
well, it's impossibly complicated, but the containment fieldis tied into the basic operationsof the device.
it literally can't shut downuntil we collapse the matter bridge.
it's a safety protocol, one that i can't reprogramuntil we can power down the device.
so we're trapped in here until you can get this thing fixed?
Yes.
what happens until then?
the bridge will continue to draw heatfrom the heat-sink.
we just dropped 10 degrees in 10 minutes.
in an hour, we'll be below zero.
we're going to freeze to death.
well, I've activated the facility's heating system.
that should buy us a little bit of time.
you said "without a hitch," you'd run hundreds of tests.
someone has messed with the system.
that was out of line, man.
he stole the work.
Hey, come on.
it was in the middle of his presentation.
he was about to start the thing up!
it couldn't wait.
he brought you here as an olive branch.
he wanted to bury the hatchet.
Yeah, in my back.
Dr. mckay?
Dr. keller?
yes?
Mr. tunney would like a word.
well, I'm guessing that that word is "I apologize."
that's, uh, two words, genius.
that's one odd duck, that guy.
well, it takes a big man to admit that he's wrong, and much as i appreciate it, I really would prefer that this whole apology thingtook place a little more publicly.
are you kidding?
you are the onewho should be apologizing to me.
what the hell for?
I invited you here as a courtesy.
out of kindness.
you know, most people think you've lost your mind, that you've gone, uh, howard hughes.
just because I don't call anymoredoesn't mean i'm keeping my urine in jars.
look, I don't need you to-- -shut up. I don't have time for this.
what have you two done?
what have we done?
we can't shut the device down.
I told you not to turn it on.
I practically begged you.
but would you listen? No!
tell us what you did and how to do it and I'll consider not pressing charges.
we didn't do anything.
Oh, really?
explain this, then.
we shouldn't be in here.
stand guard there.
Why? -It'll take me a couple seconds to hack into his computer.
what are you doing?
if that son of a bitch thinks that he can humiliate mein front of my peers and get away with it, he's got another thing coming.
I will destroy him.
now is not the time, rodney.
got to be something in here I can useto discredit the pretentious tool.
hurry up, hurry up, somebody's coming.
come on, come on, come on.
now, look, I can see how, out of context, that could seem incriminating...
out of context?
what were you doing in there?
I was looking for a paper I publisheda little over two years ago, one that dealt with a matter bridge.
Rodney, you have not published a paper in a very long time.
you probably didn't even know it was my work.
Oh, you're publishing under a nom de plume now?
okay, here's how I think it went down
you were working with the government.
someone there trusted you a lotand let you see something you weren't supposed to see.
or maybe you were sent something by accident, who knows.
you saw a paper about a matter bridge, a project that was shut downdue to the adverse effects of exotic particles.
you read it, you realized that if the bridge was usedmerely as a transfer of energy, say heat, there would be no exotic particle creationand thus no adverse effects.
so...
you co-opted the science as your own, made a few changes to make yourself feel better, and got to work, dismissing the original authors' warningsabout the inherent instabilityof time-space bridges.
how am I doing so far?
that's preposterous. Dr.Tunney's been working on this for years.
that was my work, Malcolm.
I wrote that paper.
Terrence, these people may be able to help us.
this is bad.
the sabotage?
sabotage.
please.
but you said there was-- -I may have rushed to judgment.
can you shut it down?
look, these matter bridgesare the very definition of unpredictable.
you know, I think I remember you sayingsomething about that before.
yes or no, doctor?
I don't know yet.
have you turned up the heat?
Yes.
have you noticed this?
Yes.
what is it?
the bridge isn't drawing a consistent loadfrom the heat-sink.
instead, it's wavering.
why is that bad?
I wouldn't necessarily call it bad.
it's definitely not good, but I don't know that I'd call it bad.
you're kidding me, right?
a regular bridgeshould draw the same amount of energyat all times.
this one is fluctuating greatly.
maybe we can use that...
wait for it to peak, then overload it and crash.
that's a good idea.
Yeah, I thought you'd like it...
what with it being my idea and all.
it's freezing in here.
we get it.
it works.
shut it down. I'm starting to freeze to my chair.
what the hell was that?
a sudden and dramatic cooling beam.
the irregular power pull from the bridge...
Oh, so when the bridgemakes a sudden demand on the heat-sink...
the heat-sink reactsby drawing power from a single, localized placeinside the containment field.
and that beam would freeze anything in its path.
Oh, did not see this coming.
it's freeze lightning.
freeze lightning...ooh, I like that.
Oh, you can't have it. it's mine.
it's copywritten.
how's he doing?
he's in very bad shape.
it's like his whole left side has been flash-frozen.
I have never seen anything like this before.
Oh, man.
look, this isn't entirely your fault.
I...I really hope he signed his waiver.
do you think this is the first time this has happened?
Yeah, or maybe just the first timeanyone's been around to notice it.
so this thing could be wreaking havoc all over the facility.
so this is going to keep happening?
Yes, and probably with greater frequency.
okay, this little side effectis going to really hamperour attempts to shut this thing down.
and by "hamper," you mean "get us all killed."
Yeah, something like that.
we need to call in the military.
I'd prefer not to do that just yet.
you're lucky that guy out there isn't dead.
I'm sure these twocan get the device back into its proper operating mode.
it's a little late for that.
Terrence, things have gotten out of hand.
we need to make that call.
we make that call, the government shuts us down.
Yeah, that's the idea.
I don't understand.
when the device started to malfunction, the first thing you wanted to dowas get everyone out of here safely.
to avoid the project being brandedas too dangerous to move forward.
well, the cat's out of the bag now.
are you worried about all the moneyyou sunk into this?
cause that's gone.
no, I'm not worried about the money.
we're close to coming up with a solutionfor global warming.
we could save the planet.
it's bigger than me, and it's bigger than you.
if we can get the device under control without calling the military, they're going to let us continue our research.
I've got news for you.
you can't control it, and you shouldn't continue with your research.
we'll figure it out.
I have the utmost faith in both of you.
this is ridiculous.
give me your cell.
it won't work, not with the containment field up.
there's too much interference.
you have a land line in your office.
it's dead.
give me that.
it's dead.
Kramer must have killed the phones.
I don't suppose you have accessto the communications room?
it's a kramer facility.
I just work here.
great.
looks like it's up to you and me.
we'd better get back to the control room, figure this out ourselves.
wait. wait, wait.
isn't there, like, a room full of geniuses out there?
that's debatable.
if that freeze lightning thing happens again, people could die.
they'll slow me down.
what happened to that "humble" thingwe were going to try today?
the resultis what I am calling "freeze lightning."
unbelievable. -it is the sudden and immediate transfer of heatfrom a localized area, and it is potentially very lethal.
we need to figure out how to collapse the matter bridge, stop it from drawing energy from the heat-sink, otherwise it's going to get "unlivably" cold in here.
why don't we just turn this containment field offand get out of here?
well, for one thing, it's tied into the basic functionof the matter bridge, so we can't just shut it off.
even if we could, it houses so much cool air now that it would create a sudden, massive cold frontas soon as it drops.
we're talking high-speed winds, tornadoes...
an instant mega-storm.
not to mention the factthat the heat-sink would start to draw heatnot just from this facility, but from the entire planet.
we cannot allow that to happen.
why don't we just destroy it, just bash it apart?
because that could create a tear in our space time.
never mind, then.
Yeah.
look, you guys are the best of the best.
I'm sure if you work together, you'll come up with something.
that will never work.
look.
just give me two seconds...
No!
you're going about this all wrong.
watch who you're correcting,"science guy."
my ph.d.is not honorary.
Hey, look, I'm an engineer.
I can do math!
just listen to my idea
I have been listening, and that is what led me to believethat you are a moron!
if it's any consolation, you're both wrong.
what, and you're right?
we're supposed to listen to you?
you're the jerk that got us into this mess.
I have a workable theory.
Yeah, a "theory."
take into account that I have experience with this, that I've been doing work that is years ahead of anything you guys have even been dreaming about?
I think that's kind of what i'm getting at!
Hey!
this is embarrassing.
look at you--the greatest minds this world has to offer, and if I didn't know any better, I'd think there was a bunch of sixth graders in here.
you guys need to suck it up and get along.
it's like I've always said, people are more alike than they are different
not now, nye.
okay.
our lives are at stake here.
we need a solution, and we need this fast.
please...
come on, the rest of us are counting on you.
Yes, rodney.
I think I'm onto something.
it just needs some ironing out.
okay. great.
guys...
Yeah, well, let's have a look at it and just...
fresh eyes.
we'll start with bill's theory...
they'll figure something out.
I'm sure they will.
let's just hope it's before someone dies.
you know, my uncle george, he always hated the phrase"save the planet."
what?
well, he just thought it was a little backwards, you know, 'cause the planet's going to be hereno matter what happens.
it might be a giant unlivable rock, but it's going to survive.
so you're turning thisinto a discussion on semantics?
what I mean is, Mr. kramer, the work you're doing isn't about saving the planet.
it's about saving lives.
and that's a noble pursuit, trying to save billions of people...
but it's no less noble to save a hundred.
these guys, no matter how smart they are, they could use some help.
one phone call could get that help here.
now, please...
please let me make that call.
Oh, don't tell me.
Oh, god.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
can you fix it?
no. we're completely cut off.
well, that's terrible news.
it's my fault. I should have
Yeah, you should have.
you need to see this.
Oh, the cold temperaturesare affecting the containment field emitters.
when they're weak, they're on the verge of failing.
that's great.
we can get most of the peopleout of here, no?
make a call to the military?
we're surrounded by desert air.
the temperatures inside the containment fieldhas gotten very, very cold.
introducing a suddenand immediate blast of icy airwill create one hell of a vortex storm.
no way a cell transmission could make it through, let alone actually get people out of here safely.
we can ride out the storm.
no, if we can't shut down the device, the heat-sink's going to keep feeding cold airinto that weather system.
it'll never stop.
that's not good.
no, I'd rather that didn't happen.
no, no, no, no. this might be a good thing.
what is it?
well, the containment fieldis dying a slow but consistent death.
it might be weak enoughto actually punch a cell phone signal through now.
Oh, you know, you might be right.
okay, this is probably our best bet.
these two emitters are the weakest.
it's a bit of a run from here, so I'd better get going right now.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
give me your cell.
we need you here to help dismantle the bridge.
I'll make the call.
I...
come on. -all right, all right.
fine.
Thanks.
I'm going to radio once i get through.
good luck.
you too.
she seems like a very capable woman.
she sure is.
she's your sister, right?
is she single?
all right, where were we?
your idea of overwhelming the bridge to the point of collapse, it's a good one.
it's right on track.
but...
everybody here thinks it meanswe've got to dial up the heat-sink.
it's going to get even colder.
and that could resultin an unpredictable amount of freeze lightning...
which could kill us all.
right.
the facility's furnace just went down.
well, how did that happen?
we've been running at 120% for the last hourto compensate for falling temperatures.
we're in the middle of the desert.
the facility's not meant to be heated like this.
we'll get below freezing pretty darn quick now.
all right, well, we can't power it down'cause it generates its own power.
and we can't waitfor the containment field to collapsebecause the storm will probably kill us.
guys, we don't have a choice, okay.
we've got to wait for the bridge to peak, dial up the heat-sink, see if we can overwhelm it.
I know it's dangerous, but that's all we've got.
okay, look.
there's too many people in here.
I have important work to do.
I do not need you in the way, so, everybody, out!
Oh, come on.
Oh, thank god.
general landry's office.
Yes, this is dr.Jennifer keller. I need to speak to the general immediately.
it's an emergency.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? this is dr...
Hello?
son of a bitch!
should we warn everyone we're about to do this?
no, no, that would just cause a panic.
it's probably better they don't know.
we have no way of moving people to a safe area, plus we have no idea where the next freeze lightning strikecould hit.
freeze lightning-- "you know, that's a bad name.
don't look at me. it's his idea.
okay, here we go.
all right, shut it off.
I can't. it hasn't collapsed the bridge yet.
I had a signal before. come on!
it's not working!
we just need a little more time, a little more time.
the lightning strikesare freezing off whole sections of the facility.
everyone is getting isolated.
it doesn't matter. they'll melt eventually if we can shut this thing down.
you are going to kill us all!
look, i just need to keep doing
what did you do?
I turned it down.
what? why?
it was too dangerous.
but we were almost there. it was peaking out! it was going to work.
Yeah, and we'd all be dead.
we have to come up with something else.
Yeah, something fast!
cause the containment field is about to fail.
great.
Oh, not good.
Rodney, can you hear me?
please tell me you got through to the sgc?
no.
you've got to keep trying.
I'd love to, but my phone got a little soaked.
it's not even...turning on.
what?
my hallway got hitby that freeze lightning thing.
are you okay?
I am now, but i won't be for long.
what happened?
I'm frozen in.
and the pipes busted open.
my body temperature is dropping really fast.
okay, i'll radio security.
I'll get someone out to her right away.
look, security's on the way.
I need you just to sit tightand try to stay warm, okay?
okay.
sorry i didn't get the call through.
you did your best.
did you shut down that thing down?
not yet. we're working on it.
hurry.
okay, look, i've got to go.
someone's on the way, all right.
what is it?
containment field failurein 3...
2...1...
winds aloft reaching dangerous levels.
if it continues like this, we'll have a mess of tornadoes on our hands.
great. even less time before we die.
look, this device is capable of generating its own power, right?
Yeah, a small percentage of the energy we're transferringis siphoned off to power the device.
so once it's running, it's self-sustaining.
which is why we can't just pull the plug.
exactly.
but it's only capable of powering itself to a certain extent?
it has a finite amount of power generation capability?
well, yes, of course.
maybe we've been approaching this the wrong way.
we've been trying to force so much powerthrough the bridgethat it overloads it.
maybe we should starve it--suck so much power from its generatorthat it stalls it out.
technically, we could do that, but you'd have to draw an insane amount of power.
the heat-sink could never do it.
no...
but another space-time bridge could.
you want to open another space-time bridge?
the device was rigged to power a single bridge.
we open another one...and it overwhelms the system and it fails.
it'll work.
Y- yeah, but do you have any ideahow difficult it will beto configure the system to open two concurrent space-time bridges?
I never said it was going to be easy.
well, it'll be impossible.
Hey, I'm dr.Rodney Mckay, all right?
"difficult" takes a few seconds,"impossible," a few minutes.
Rodney, can you hear me?
have they got you out of there yet?
no.
Tunney, what's the deal? I thought you sent security.
they can't get to her.
what? why not?
Oh, that last round of freeze lightning, it sealed off a lot of the corridors.
see, they're making their way to her, but it'll take some time.
it's getting harder...
harder to stay awake. i'm going into...hypothermic shock.
Jennifer, just hang in there, all right?
all right, we're here, right?
so we can get to her. it's a straight shot.
they should have come this way, through the lab.
they're cut off from us too.
I've got to go get her.
no, wait. we're a bit busy right now.
she'll die. -if the storm keeps up like this, it'll rip the building apart, we'll all die!
last I checked, you were claiming to be a genius.
I already gave you the plan.
a plan full of holes.
so fill them!
w- what if i run into a problem?
work around it!
you're smarter than me.
I know.
Oh, this is outrageous!
when we need him the most, he puts it on me, and i'm supposed to be the one to
man up.
okay, I think that's it.
before I run it, just check my math.
I have been!
why do you think I'm standing here?
okay, come on, come on, come on.
do it!
you're not breathing. oh, my god, you're not breathing.
Oh, please don't be dead.
please don't be dead.
come back to me, please.
please come back to me.
it worked!
the second space-time bridge blew the power supply.
both bridges collapsed.
I did it!
please...
Oh, thank god.
you're okay. you're okay...
I'm really cold.
me too...
you saved me.
I guess that makes us even.
I used an ax.
a big ax.
I really wish you were conscious,'cause I think it's the coolest thing I've ever done-oh...
I don't know what I would have done if I lost you...
I love you.
I have for some time now.
I just wanted you to know.
I...
well, at least your friendsdon't think you're a washout anymore.
stupid bill nyeis telling everyone who will listenthat tunney's the guy who turned the device off.
because he was the one that shut off the device.
with my coding. it was my idea.
Rodney, does it really matter?
Yes.
Yes, it does.
I'm sorry, I know I'm supposed to be humble, not supposed to care, but I do, I really do.
and that's...that's something you should know about me.
well, quit, then.
join the private sector.
start doing work the whole world can see.
I've been thinking about it.
what? no, you haven't.
my contract with sgc is up this year.
maybe it's time to move on, time to do other things.
please...I don't know anyone who loves their job more than you.
so you think the militaryis going to let them keep experimenting?
I think it's highly unlikely.
besides, geoengineering is a dumb pursuit anyway.
no one person's going to solve global warming.
we all have to do our part.
like not take private jets.
well, they were going our way anyway.
you know, It's kind of nice, just me and you back here.
right.
right!
you were legally dead a few hours ago.
you were practically frozen. you really want to...
well, it's either thator you keep telling mehow you, and only you, saved the day.
Nah...
I'm trying out this whole "humble" thing out.
seems to be quite a hit with the ladies...
all you have to do is prick him, once.
the effect will be immediate.
he'll believe you to be his loyal slave jarren.
Whoa! No violence.
your name?
bounty hunter.
don't worry about sg-1 and earth.
they are of little consequence.
approaching the coordinates now, sir.
drop us out of hyperspace. Maximum shields.
Colonel?
we should have a visual.
if the second supergate is here, we should be able to see it.
anything, on the sensors?
there seems to be a powerful gravitational field nearby.
Supergates use black holes for power.
Oh, this is not a black hole.
it's a neutron star, and the field is powerful enough to weaken our shields and cause
damage report!
reporting hull damage on decks 2 and 7.
battle stations!
get us out of here, major.
hyperdrive will not engage.
hull integrity has been compromised!
who the hell is shooting at us?
I can't tell, sir.
detecting three ships.
Ori?
based on size,
I'd say goa'uld motherships.
their shields should be weakened as well!
fire all forward rail guns. Arm missiles.
major, transfer auxiliary power to sublight engines and set a course, hard right.
sir, detecting multiple small objects dead ahead.
Oh, god.
it's a minefield.
full reverse thrust!
damage report!
emergency subspace communication from the odyssey, sir.
put it onscreen.
stargate command, this is colonel paul emerson of the odyssey, authentication code delta-six-alpha-five.
we're under attack. We've suffered extreme damage.
intel about the second supergate was false.
we've been ambushed by as many as three goa'uld motherships.
we've lost hyperdrive, shields are down.
several decks without life support.
we're being boarded!
that's it, sir. That's all we got.
we began receiving telemetry from the emergency transponder approximately 30 minutes after the distress call came in.
unfortunately, it doesn't tell us anything about the condition of the ship or the crew.
sounds like it was badly damaged.
anything on who might have been behind this?
we were acting on what we thought was reliable intel from the jaffa.
Bra'tac is investigating the source of the false intel, but the jaffa nation is in disarray, and many have reverted back to old warring factions.
tracing such betrayal may prove virtually impossible.
there must be a lot of jaffa out there who are pretty angry about the destruction of dakara.
the ori were responsible for that.
there are morethan a few who think it was us who led them there.
angry enough to set up an ambush? For what, revenge?
well, we have a signal. Let's go check it out.
Yeah, one tiny snag there.
we have no vessels in which to travel.
the daedalus is on its way to pegasus.
and it will be days before a jaffa ship becomes available to us.
well, you only have to ask.
you must know by now that I can get you pretty much anything you want.
Yeah, for a price.
nothing comes for free, daniel.
of course, in this instance,
I would naturally waive my fee, but I will need some front money, so to speak.
be careful.
we still have no idea who's behind this.
glad to see you're awake, colonel.
how's your head?
it's fine, sir.
what's our status?
they towed us out of the minefield.
most of the crew is accounted for.
we're still missing three.
which one of you is colonel samantha carter?
I'm colonel paul emerson, commander of this ship.
if you have any questions, you ask me
if any of you try to be heroes, I assure you my commander will think nothing of venting this hold of all atmosphere.
I will not ask again.
I'm carter.
bring her.
him too.
Colonel carter...
I had heard you were quite attractive.
I'm colonel paul emerson, commander, of this ship.
what do you want?
nothing you can do for me.
now, colonel carter, on the other hand...
can I call you samantha?
no.
you're lucian alliance.
the uniform.
pathetic, isn't it?
pretending to be something we're not.
Anateo is my name, and believe me,
I am part of no alliance of any kind.
now, we don't know much about this ship yet, but we have found a subspace beacon that is giving away our position.
I need you to shut it off.
I'm not going to help you.
I don't see what choice you have.
you are going to do whatever it is I want you to do.
don't do it, sam.
Oh, I suggest you should do it...
it's not designed to be shut off.
it activates automatically and stays on.
then remove it.
don't help them, colonel.
that's an order.
I believe that now makes you the ranking officer on this ship, colonel carter.
I suggest you get to work, unless there's something else you'd rather do.
Yeah, she's a real beauty.
stabilizers are a bit wonky,
I'm afraid. Makes for a bumpy ride, but it's all perfectly safe.
Really?
not exactly.
we gave you as much raw naquadah as you needed and all you came up with was this piece of junk?
people's lives are at stake, daniel.
do you honestly think that I cheaped out on the ship and pocketed the difference?
what's that?
life support seems to be failing.
can you take over?
great, you fixed that. How about fixing the stabilizers?
I didn't fix anything.
I just disabled that annoying alarm.
our long-range sensors indicate that the signal coming from the odyssey transponder is changing location.
it's moving?
it appears to be traveling at sublight speed.
altering course to intercept.
are you cloaking?
I am attempting to.
it does not appear the cloak is responding.
the signal now appears to be originating from that planet.
sensors are picking up numerous lifesigns.
if life support were compromised they could have landed the ship for repairs.
they are not responding to our hails.
there appears to be a small civilization on the surface.
I knew I recognized this planet.
more friends of yours?
the goa'uld used to have a ship-building facility here.
it's now been taken over by the former human slaves.
from what I know, they have ties with the lucian alliance.
you know, that doesn't sound too good.
are we talking chop-shop here?
I have a contact here.
he might get skittish if we all show up, so it could be a good idea for me to go in alone.
you know, it could be a trap.
all the more reason why we shouldn't all go.
trust me, if he knows anything,
I'll be able to get it out of him, but the key is to be as inconspicuous and as non-threatening as possible.
if you like, I can take daniel.
Colonel... what happened?
you've been gone for hours.
Where's colonel emerson?
Vala mal doran...
I never thought you'd show your face in these parts again.
Borzin, you slimy, two-faced grease peddler.
come on, give us a hug.
and what poor loser have you conned into your company this time?
Oh, this is my apprentice, shamus.
you must be learning a great deal.
more than I'd like to.
actually, I only took him on as part of a bet. He's mentally disabled.
don't trust her. She will sell you out for a bad lunch the first chance she gets.
I know.
he likes me.
isn't that cute?
what do you want, vala, if you haven't already stolen it from me?
we're looking for some information.
about a tau'ri ship that was attacked not far from here.
any information you can give us...
okay, my friend...
here's the thing.
he's not my apprentice.
he's a mark.
No! -A very rich, very gullible one. Who's eating right out of my hands.
give us something, anything, and he'll make it very much worth your while.
you know, I've heard that before
all right, try this.
we traced the signal from the ship's emergency transponder here.
I know you can't possibly have the whole ship, but I know you must have some parts.
Borzin, I don't know what's going on, but you're in way over your head.
I've recently made some contacts high up in the lucian alliance that'd be very interested in knowing exactly how much you've been skimming off this operation.
offers that can't be refused.
over here.
while we're at it, why not get him to throw in some parts for our cargo ship?
one thing at a time.
is this what you're looking for?
that's odyssey's data recorder.
the transponder's still broadcasting.
where did you get this?
a man brought it a few hours ago.
he said it could fetch me a very nice price.
Anateo is my name, and believe me,
I am part of no alliance of any kind.
it's not designed to be shut off.
it activates automatically and stays on.
then remove it.
don't help them, colonel. That's an order.
you want more, show me the naquadah.
you know, that thing's useless to me unless I know who gave it to you.
Ooh, timing's everything. Him.
Jackson, report.
you want more, show me the naquadah.
you know, that thing's useless to me unless I know who gave it to you.
Ooh, timing's everything. Him.
we suspected it could be another ambush.
you think they were specifically after you?
they knew we would follow the transponder signal.
Why?
perhaps they were trying to deter us from trying to find the odyssey.
personally, I think they just don't like us.
well, I can see why they might not be your biggest fans.
well, whatever the reason, there was no other way to retrieve this intel.
the recording suggests the odyssey wasn't destroyed but is in the hands of the lucian alliance.
unfortunately, that's all we got.
Borzin disappeared along with daniel and vala, and no one else we talked to knew anything.
Teal'c, spread the word among the jaffa.
tell whoever will listen
I want to talk to the leader of the lucian alliance.
I've always felt civilization can be judged by two things
its food...
and its women.
I'd say yours is only halfway there.
I don't blame you, but you have to keep up your strength.
you have a whole ship to fix.
you know, that could ake the rest of my life.
whether that is long or painfully short is up to you.
Hi, sam!
we thought you'd miss us.
where are the others?
listen, there is that small matter of my fee.
Oh, of course.
half payment for half of sg-1.
two-fifths, actually.
it's a small quibble, but-- don't help.
look, it is not my fault that only two of them showed up.
of course.
take care of him.
look, I,uh... I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be seeing you again.
no, I think not.
put them in the hold.
don't worry, sam. It's all part of the plan.
each division of lucian alliance territory is controlled by one of netan's lieutenants, or "seconds,
as they're called. There are about 20 such individuals overseeing operations including smuggling, extortion, racketeering, and of course, trafficking in kassa.
is there anything new coming?
because this feels like a rerun to me.
well, we've been following up on rumors of betrayal and possible mutiny among the seconds.
there seems to be mounting dissent over netan's leadership.
well, that's good, but how does it help us?
and trusted seconds. He oversees a large kassa production operation on a remote group of planets on the outskirts of the galaxy.
what about him?
besides the fact that he's a brutal killer with a notorious temper
we've only know of him by reputation, sir.
he's extremely reclusive, and rarely, if ever, leaves his command ship.
very few, if any, of netan's inner circle have ever met the guy.
you think this kefflin is behind the disappearance of the odyssey?
no, sir.
I think he's the perfect candidate to impersonate.
excuse me?
I am suggesting that I infiltrate the lucian alliance.
it's the only way we're going to get reliable information on the odyssey.
you don't even have a decent picture of the man.
that's what makes him the perfect candidate, sir.
Dr. Jackson used it a few years back to infiltrate a system lord summit.
one jab of that, and netan will believe I am who I say I am regardless of what I look like.
no one else will question me because no one else has ever seen him.
so you think.
I'm not saying it isn't risky, sir.
I'm saying we have to do something.
how are you holding up?
I'm working as slowly as I can, but I can't keep it up forever.
any idea what they plan on doing with the ship?
or us? -No, but without the transponder, stargate command doesn't have a hope of finding us.
our only chance is to take the ship back.
well, I have an idea about that, but it's pretty risky.
well, it's probably better than our plan.
well, what's your plan?
we don't have one.
they have detected us, colonel mitchell.
are you prepared?
prepared as I'll ever be.
state your business.
I'm kefflin.
I'm here to see netan.
you are not expected.
I don't have to be expected.
authorize me for immediate transport, or I'll have your head as an ornament for my ship.
I will notify netan of your arrival.
where is netan?
I will take you to him.
fine. Let's go.
first, you must submit to a search.
I don't think so.
I asked not to be disturbed.
I apologize, netan, but there has been an incident.
I tried to tell them who I was, but apparently, the name kefflin didn't seem to mean much around here.
sorry about that.
the ring was a gift from my latest...conquest.
my dear friend kefflin is here, and you didn't inform me?
I'm sorry, master.
you asked not to be disturbed.
so you beat him instead.
as you can see, the beating wasn't...
entirely one way.
I'm sure it wasn't.
leave us.
what?
it is not too late to turn this ship over to netan.
you would be a hero.
you know I can't do that.
netan has failed the alliance, and his position as leader hangs precariously by a thread.
he knows I am his mostworthy challenger, but he could not very well just murder me in cold blood, so he sent us on a fool's quest.
but we succeeded.
Yes, and this is going to ensure the downfall of netan.
but why was it necessary to also bait a trap to capture sg-1?
because everyone knows that they have caused us more grief than any other adversary, including the ori.
all the seconds, including me, have begged netan to go after them, but he refused. He's a coward, choosing to run and hide rather than face the wrath of the tau'ri.
will we not?
we have brought their battleship to its knees.
what are they going to do?
after I present odyssey and sg-1 to the others, netan's stuffed corpse will be a trophy on my wall and control of the lucian alliance will be mine.
it's been a disappointing season, my friend.
drought and floods have ravaged our highest-yielding kassa plantations.
the armies of the ori continue to usurp the planets upon which we've established trade, and of course there's the tau'ri...
Yes.
committing our ships to co-operate in the fight gainst the ori incursion was a strategic mistake.
you've always appreciated my honesty in the past.
I have.
you're the boss.
I don't blame you, but others do.
I know.
is that why you're here?
the kefflin I know would never make such a trip without a serious purpose.
actually, it's the odyssey.
the tau'ri vessel.
word reached me you just captured it.
I wanted to know your plans.
its beaming and hyperspace technology could be a great advantage in transporting my crops.
where did you hear this? - The usual channels.
I heard rumor that the odyssey was destroyed in battle with the ori.
nothing has been confirmed yet.
I certainly had nothing to do with it.
a ship has been detected in proximity.
we are moving to intercept.
I'm beginning to think you enjoy being my prisoner.
sorry.
I accidentally overloaded a power coupling.
where is the rest of your team?
that man knows nothing of torture.
I'll find what we need.
I was wondering how long you'd be able to resist.
if you don't mind, I'm going to need some time alone with him.
all right, we have to find a way to get you out of here.
have you found the location of odyssey?
not yet, and I don't think netan knows where it is either, and he's definitely having some trouble with his seconds.
then you must maintain this ruse...
no, teal'c... not at your expense, no.
there are other lives at stake, mitchell.
fine.
just remember, I am an expert torturer.
something's going on in the hold.
go do a head count.
Vashin, make room.
this is kefflin.
I thought you did not like to show your face.
I'm seeing a therapist.
this is gavos. Slaviash.
what did you learn from the jaffa?
apparently, the rumors are true. The odyssey's still out there...
in the hands of anateo.
the tau'ri are in possession of an audio recording which indicates that he's in control of it.
I ordered the attack on the odyssey.
it is time the tau'ri were sent a message.
where is the ship?
I don't know.
Anateo has betrayed us. - Are you saying he succeeded...
in capturing the ship?
he hasn't reported in yet.
the tau'ri vessel is most powerful.
you could not have possibly expected him to survive.
I gave him a strategy that vastly improved his odds.
he came to me several months ago, demanding more territory...
as his planets had been overrun by the armies of the ori.
he suggested that he eliminate you, karug, take over your planets.
Anateo hasn't just captured the odyssey.
he's using it to bait a trap for sg-1.
he has lost his mind.
the tau'ri will declare all-out war on us.
you should have consulted with us, netan.
I need not consult with anyone!
now, is there anyone else who wants to challenge me?
Anateo betrayed us all, and he will pay, and as for the tau'ri, they were already at war with us and us with them, and I will not cower in fear.
so spread the word.
send all available ships.
I want the odyssey found.
now!
was it really necessary to embarrass me like that?
there have been whispers lately concerning the strength of your leadership.
I suspect...
those whispers will now stop.
for the time being.
you'll need someone to supervise gavos' territory.
your cut will be 20%.
come on!
I'm working as fast as I can... - you stole the prometheus all by yourself...
I know. The systems are all new.
you said you could do it. We do not exactly have a lot of time.
no. Sam warned us that a number of the arrays have been damaged.
even with locators, beaming a person from one room to another within the ship is very risky.
do you want them to rematerialize between the decks?
Teresh, this is anateo.
you missed your check-in. - Report.
move!
where are they?
Dr. Jackson and vala!
Anateo... we've got a problem.
Dr. Jackson, vala...
just wanted to let you know that your duplicity has already forfeited colonel carter's life.
unless you surrender immediately, the rest of the crew is next.
I can't be sure.
do it anyway.
no one else is going to fix this ship.
I think it's pretty clear that you've just been stalling, and that you're not really going to fix it for me anyway.
I'm just going to have to figure it out for myself.
good enough.
where is she?
well, I couldn't be sure, so I just beamed out the only other lifesign in the room instead.
okay, where is he?
well, sam did say it was risky.
when she's right, she's right.
only 50% of the shield emitters are responding.
okay, we need to get them back online and get the hull integrity back within acceptable parameters.
hyperdrive is our priority.
well, we think most of anateo's men have been accounted for.
most?
Yeah, we swept the ship twice, rounded up 14 men in total, but not solek.
Vala had to beam him out of the hold where the crew was being held, so we have no way of knowing for sure where he ended up.
did you check the sewage reservoir?
Yeah, no lifesigns.
how's it going here?
well, no shields, no weapons, no communications, and at least a day out for hyperdrive.
so we're sitting ducks.
kefflin, what are you doing?
interrogating the prisoner further.
and what have you learned?
not much yet.
fine.
then we can kill him together.
kill him?
we've learned all we can.
Anateo has left us no choice.
I am committed to sending a message to the tau'ri.
netan, I have to admit...
I was just beginning to enjoy this one.
I'm sorry my old friend.
your fun is over.
the odyssey has been found.
tenat, welcome.
this is my good friend kefflin.
it is my pleasure.
I have heard a great deal about you... kefflin.
Yeah, likewise.
tell me what you have learned, tenat, and perhaps I will spare your pathetic life.
funny as always, netan.
as you suspected, the odyssey was never destroyed.
Anateo betrayed you and kept it for himself.
where is it?
half a day's journey, maybe less.
I have transmitted the coordinates to your bridge.
get to your ship. We'll travel together.
of course.
wait just a moment...
look, I don't know who you think I am...
you are cam mitchell, bounty hunter.
you double-crossed me and my partner jup.
what do you want?
I do not know how you've managed to convince netan that you are kefflin, but you are obviously up to something big here.
I will take half.
and what about your loyalty to netan?
he would kill me the instant I am no longer of use to him.
and jup, your old partner, where's he?
he is working elsewhere at the moment.
we need not worry about cutting him in.
fine, 10%.
it'll be big, trust me.
30%, or I tell netan you are not who you say you are.
25%, no more.
I'll ring over to your ship before this one jumps to hyperspace and fill you in on the details.
unchain the prisoner. He's coming with me.
I have grown weary of this torture, colonel mitchell.
that's pretty obvious, but right now...
we got to go.
you remember tenat?
Yeah, as in jup and tenat.
well, he somehow weaseled his way into commanding an alliance mothership, and check this out... the incompetent twit actually found the odyssey.
did he see you?
Yeah, recognized me as well, but he's keeping his mouth shut, because he figures I'm scamming netan and he wants a piece of the action.
we have to get over to his ship before this one jumps to hyperspace.
what is your plan?
I'm making it up as I go along.
netan is here to see you.
what?
I know of your intention to deceive me. - Well, how did you...
I knew colonel mitchell was impersonating kefflin all along.
Colonel mitchell?
of sg-1.
I caught him and teal'c trying to leave my ship.
no, netan, you are mistaken.
it's true.
I knew he wasn't kefflin.
but I was merely trying to lure him here so I could turn him over to you.
that is the stupidest thing I have ever heard!
please... don't kill me.
get up, you pathetic excuse for A...
whatever you are.
what are you going to do to me?
nothing for the moment.
Oh, thank you.
you are a generous and gracious man.
I say that all the time, don't I, men?
tell him how honored you are to finally meet him in person...
shut up. Stop sniveling.
Dr. Jackson...
if these sensors are working properly, two goa'uld motherships just emerged from hyperspace and are closing in.
Sam? - Go ahead.
we may need that hyperdrive a little ahead of schedule.
how ahead of schedule?
about 10 seconds would be good. We've got company.
we need more time. Can you stall?
we're about to find out.
what's our shield status? - Less than 30%.
weapons?
rail guns are online, but we don't have missiles yet.
one of the ships is hailing us.
on screen.
Dr. Jackson... - oh, right.
Hi. Hi. How are you?
I was expecting anateo.
Yes, he was here for a while, but then he... had to go.
your ship is battered.
my scans tell me your shield strength is low, and if you had hyperdrive, you would have left long ago.
surrender now or be destroyed.
right... okey-dokey.
we surrender.
prepare to be boarded.
Yeah, see, that's where you're going to run into a bit of a problem.
you see, our rings are damaged, and as you yourself pointed out, our shields are down, which means atmosphere in the 302 bays is unsustainable.
I- I mean, I just don't see how we're going to get your guys over here unless you want me to try...beaming you over?
they're powering weapons.
Sam, I think I've stalled as long as I can.
we need more time. - Too late.
you should probably prepare to return fire.
for the record...
I'm always prepared.
I just have to press this button here.
right. I just... I thought that's what you're supposed to say, so I...
I know.
open fire on the other hatak vessel.
what? - You heard me.
but... you dare question my tactics?
there's a ship full of traitors out there waiting to unseat me as leader of the lucian alliance.
fire now!
you shall be richly rewarded with vast territories to command.
fire on the other hatak vessel.
one of the motherships is firing at the other.
receiving radio signal.
odyssey, this is teal'c. Do you copy?
it is good to hear your voice.
Colonel mitchell and i are onboard one of the motherships.
request that you beam us aboard the odyssey immediately.
Yeah.
locking on their locator beacons.
what are you doing?
what?
how?
I thought this was netan.
what are you doing sitting there?
what are you wearing?
Oh, it's A... long story.
you are the biggest fool in two galaxies!
but netan... I...
I screwed up.
it's the wrong one. You can't just jam it in.
how did you do that?
honestly? I don't know. That almost never normally works.
Daniel, try it now.
shield failure is imminent.
damn you, cam mitchell.
you know, you're very lucky that no one else on the bridge of that ship knew what netan looked like.
Yeah, it was a gamble but I figured if I got made, or if the chemical jab on tenat didn't work after half an hour,
I'd take the bridge by force.
I had a pissed off jaffa waiting to help me out.
Where's teal'c?
Ah, he's in the infirmary.
Yeah, big boy got banged up a bit.
Hey, what happened?
how did you get the lucian alliance to fire on each other?
Oh, you'll love this...
before you tell us
I got long range-communications back online and sent a message to earth telling them that we'll be coming home.
Yeah.
you should probably add that we have officially declared war on the lucian alliance.
unscheduled offworld activation!
what the hell was that?
I don't know, Sir.
we're receiving SG-1's IDC.
they're back early. Open the iris.
there was nothing on your end?
nothing out of the ordinary to account for what we heard?
no Sir, it was perfectly routine, we just dialed the Gate and stepped through.
gate diagnostics showed no irregularities.
still I'd like you to double check the data once we're done here.
Yes, Sir.
tell me about the planet...
well we can confirm that the locals were visited by a Prior two weeks ago. He performed the...
standard miracles, healed the sick, cured the blind and...
passed out the usual literature.
the natives are easy pickings they feel as though they were abandoned by their God Amaterasu and...
excuse me? - You said Amaterasu...
according to the background file, P4R was once under Ba'al's control...
sir...
we went to PX7-455, I believe you have the wrong report.
anyway.
the Tok'ra have been monitoring the inroads that the Ori have been making in the region for quite some time.
according to Selmak they are taking advantage of the relationships between...
did you just say Selmak?
indeed.
teal'c... Selmak is dead.
sir...
Selmak and Jacob are very much alive.
offworld activation!
chief... - It's SG-1's IDC, Sir.
this is when they were originally scheduled to come back.
defense teams stand by.
open the iris.
well, according to the tests I've run, they're both SG-1.
identical in every way. - How's that possible?
well, we know Ba'al's able to produce adult clones of himself. Presumably he could do the same with our people given samples of their DNA.
that doesn't explain how they knew SG-1's IDC.
and if their Intel was good enough to get their hands on something that sensitive, - then how come they didn't know about Selmak? - Yeah.
it's like they got the hard stuff right and the easy stuff wrong.
ba'al would have known better.
you know the first team was making some pretty wild claims about people in past events.
and since the second team came back from the right planet at the scheduled time, - it's safe to assume that they're the real SG-1. - Okay.
then who's the other team and where'd they come from?
exactly.
we checked their story out, we went to PX7-445, the planet they claimed to have gated in from the locals there swore they'd never laid eyes on us.
so...
this other team...
is lying.
not necessarily Sir.
it's possible they did gate in from PX7... just not the PX7 that we know.
the multiverse theory of quantum physics deposits the existence of parallel universes.
an infinite number of ever growing alternate realities that exist concurrently with our own.
the theory holds that anything that can happen, will happen.
if not in this reality, then in another.
so you're saying that somewhere in an alternate universe,
I got to second base with Amy Pandenberg?
theoretically, yes.
boggles the mind, doesn't it?
we're part of a metaverse in which individual subuniverses are continually being generated.
our own experience with the quantum mirror proved as much.
realities can exist where... we never defeated the Goa'uld or, - the Stargate program went public. - And Selmak is still alive.
exactly.
now, while it may feel immediate, the journey between Gates is not instantaneous.
it takes on average 0. 3 seconds travel time. However, according to Gate diagnostics, the travel time for the other SG-1 team clocked in at 3. 4 seconds, suggesting a significantly longer trip.
OK, say for example we accept... the possibility that this is an alternate SG-1 from a...
parallel universe.
how did they get here?
I got nothing.
yet.
sumatra Mandheling.
one cream. Two sugars.
lucky guess.
usually I have instant myself.
so, I'm guessing this almost feels like home, doesn't it?
almost like home.
but...
if it was home,
I'd be sitting where your sitting and you'd be sitting here, telling me:
I'd love to help you but I have no idea what's going on.
I'm thinking one of two possible scenarios.
a: Carter's right and you're from an alternate universe in which case we'll do everything we can to get you back home.
or B: You're not who you say you are.
in which case we need to find out what you're really after.
actually there's a third scenario.
you're not who you say you are, and it's up to us to find out what you're after.
I understand your reluctance to trust us, but rest assured we're just as eager to get to the bottom of this as you are.
no offence but, I'm not entirely sold on the alternate world theory.
there was nothing on our mission to PX7 that would even hint at it.
no quantum mirror, no weird alien artifacts. It was a routine op.
but...
you're telling me that, somehow, the Gate sent us through to a parallel universe. Even though we know it's not supposed to work like that.
and yet here you are.
assuming of course this is the SGC.
six years ago.
wake up in what they think is the SGC, turns out they're not really on Earth and it's all part of an elaborate Goa'uld plot.
Pegasus Galaxy, last year.
a team from the Atlantis base...
gates through to what they think is the SGC, turns out they're not really on Earth.
it's another planet...
and they're being manipulated by aliens. - Let me put your mind at ease, we are neither the Goa'uld nor manipulative aliens.
you'll forgive me Sir if I don't take your word for it.
we won our freedom in the battle for Dakara.
and on that day not only did we defeat Ba'al and the replicators, you ensured that Anubis would never again threaten this Galaxy.
and then all Jaffa were united under our new leader
Really?
that, that that hasn't happened here yet.
and with the new threat to this galaxy I returned to SG-1.
right, along with colonel Mitchell myself, and eventually colonel Carter.
who rejoined following her... - Following her honeymoon.
what?
no. I was gonna say following her stay on the Prometheus.
honeymoon?
indeed.
we weren't able to stop the Ori from establishing the second beachhead.
by the time we realized it was too late they had already sent their ships through.
if it happened in our reality...
there's a good chance it could happen in ours as well.
they destroyed Chulak,
Dakara, most of the Jaffa strongholds. It's only a matter of time before they attack Earth.
you have to find a way to get us back. - I'm working on it.
I've been going over the Gate diagnostics. - And?
there was an unidentifiable energy spike just prior to your arrival.
it's almost certainly related to the sound they heard, but I'm still analyzing the data.
we were on PX7 for over 24 hours gathering intel.
and yet when your team went back to the planet no one recognized you.
now, that suggests that our point of departure was definitely in our universe.
so what ever happened...
had to have happened between the time you stepped through the Gate on your end, and the time you stepped through the Gate on this end.
except the Gate system isn't designed to transport matter between universes.
it isn't designed to take you back in time either but it has before.
did you notice any...
no unusual weather patterns or solar flare activity at the time.
then is it conceivable something else could have affected the wormhole.
what could possibly exert that kind of influence on a subspace matter stream?
a black hole! - A black hole!
as we discussed the situation we realized we could pinpoint the source of the phenomenon to a precise window.
specifically the in term journey between the two Gates.
did she just say we?
pardon me?
she said we. You said we?
Ah, me and myself, I suppose. The other Samantha Carter.
right finally someone who can keep up with you?
Yep.
OK, this is PX7-455, their point of departure and this, is Earth their point of arrival.
the wormhole that brought them here, cross this section of space bisecting this singularity.
the black hole that was created when we destroyed the Ori beachhead.
exactly.
now, I'm theorizing that when they bisected the singularity subspace was ruptured, creating a rift in the space-time continuum that brought that SG-1 in to this universe.
but we've had teams gate in from locations on the other side of that black hole in our universe.
why weren't they affected?
one more stupid question.
Oh, sorry. Yours was fine, mine is stupid.
why didn't we end up on alternate PX7 when we gated through to check out bizarre SG-1's story?
I can't answer that...
as far as I know the deviation was one way and specific to that particular wormhole.
however just to be on the safe side I would suggest that we reroute all Gate travel around the singularity for the time being.
unscheduled offworld activation.
what do you have for me now Walter? - Sir, It's SG-1's IDC.
again.
do you want me to send a confirmation?
if another team comes through they'll just be stranded like the first one.
receiving radio transmission. - Let's hear it.
stargate Command, this is Mitchell. What's the hold up? We've got a situation here.
sir if we don't open the iris...
stargate Command do you read?
defense teams!
open the iris.
what the hell's going on?
so much for this phenomenon being restricted to one wormhole.
I may have underestimated its influence.
it's possible the first spatial tear may have caused a ripple effect across several realities, transforming an area of their subspace into a kind of...
funnel, that's redirecting their Gate travel to this universe.
any wormhole passing close enough to the black hole is being drawn into the singularity and rerouted here.
so you're telling me we're the hub. - The convergence point, yes Sir.
it might account for why Gate travel in this universe wasn't affected.
might account. Colonel Mitchell.
sir.
inform all off world teams to proceed to the Alpha site.
until further notice Gate travel to and from Stargate Command, will be suspended, indefinitely.
what if there are more teams coming in hot, Sir? - I'm willing to make the occasional exception but I'm not about to turn this base into the grand central station of the Multiverse.
dismissed.
why is it that every team that has come through the Gate so far, has been exclusively an alternate SG-1?
I mean, how come no alternate SG-2s or SG-3s?
well, SG-1 is the frontline team, the one most likely to get into trouble offworld.
and as a result the team we'd most likely have to let through.
right.
so far we've had to turn back over 50 teams and not all of them have been SG-1.
here's the really interesting part. Each team, from each reality has dialed in from a different point of origin. No repeats.
all originating from a corridor of space starting from Earth and passing within a few degrees of the singularity.
what about that superfluous energy signature?
has that happened again? - No. Not since the first alternate team dialed in.
any idea what it was?
I'm not sure.
but it reminds me of the incident on... - K'Tau.
in that case we introduced an unstable super heavy element into their sun's nuclear reaction...
when the wormhole that brought us there passed directly through it.
but in this case the wormhole's passing through a black hole.
so who knows what the effect would be.
I thought we could use the help.
Yeah, I suppose two heads are better than one.
unscheduled offworld activation.
let's get to work.
general.
I was just about to come find you.
I have contacted Bra'tac on Dakara.
he has dispatched a mothership to the location provided to us by the other colonel Carter.
if the Ori attempt to establish a second beachhead then the Jaffa should give us a heads up.
presuming of course if events play out the same way in both universes...
to this point, the particulars of the varying universes have remained remarkably similar.
that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
another SG-1 came through twenty minutes ago. Which puts the count at twelve teams. Not including yourselves.
well, at least we're in good company. - Well, this last team is a little different in terms of personnel.
how so?
well, there's someone I thought you might like to talk to.
teal'c? Where's General O'Neill?
I'm sure you all have a lot to catch up on.
what's going on here?
Janet, this, this may look like home to you, but it's not.
this is not the Stargate Command you left, we're not the Daniel and Teal'c you know.
you and your team gated to a parallel reality, this is an alternate SGC, on an alternate Earth, in an alternate universe.
in our reality Dr. Janet Frasier died...
2 years ago.
different SG-1s.
sixteen different points of origin, but only one point of convergence, this universe.
now...
given the fact that previous trips through the black hole didn't produce a rupture in the subspace structure...
they may not have of produced the rupture but it is entirely possible, that their repeated trips contributed to the deterioration of the space time fabric that weakened, eventually seeded to the singularity.
creating the bridge between the various realities.
and I'm thinking that the proximity of these realities in relation to each other, may account for the absence of the...
entropic cascade failure. But...
it still doesn't help us with the main problem. How do we reverse the process?
I don't have the answer to this.
because if I did...
we all wouldn't be here.
coffee? - No.
thank you.
you know, I can't help but think this whole thing would be a lot easier if Hammond hadn't ordered us to destroy the quantum mirror.
we could just use that to send all these teams back to their proper realities.
how?
I mean, there are a near infinite number of parallel universes.
the chances of us finding the right home universe for even one of these teams is next to impossible.
excuse me, Colonel Carter.
my, colonel Carter...
here Sir...
I've brought another volunteer who's offered to help.
hello Samantha.
I remember the mission to P3X.
I was tending to a wounded airman, we came under fire.
you were there, you helped me stabilize him and got us out of there.
no, I didn't.
you were hit by an errant staff blast and, and killed instantly.
you were honored with a heroes funeral.
lucky me.
hopefully you will be able to return to your world soon.
hopefully? - Yeah, for the moment it looks like your...
your trip here, was only one way. - No...
no, you have to find a way to get us back as soon as possible.
Yes, Sam and Dr Lee are working on something. - But you don't understand.
we have been targeted by the Ori.
earth is being ravaged by a plague, hundreds of thousands have been infected.
if we don't find a cure the entire planet will be wiped out.
so...
how are things in your universe?
you mean between us?
I'm a little curious.
things developed, but with you being on the other side of the galaxy. Well, long distance relationships can be difficult.
I eventually joined the Stargate program to be closer to you.
we worked together.
even lived together for quite some time, but in the end, things didn't work out.
you're with someone else now.
who?
I think I have something.
this is the postmortem analysis of the P3W-451 incident.
a planet whose orbit strayed too close to a black hole.
one of our teams were attempting to gate back at the same time and as a result the SGC couldn't shut down the Gate from this end.
I don't see what this... - We were unable to sever the connection because Stargate Command was still connected to the singularity's gravitational field through the open Stargate.
but we're not trying to... - In that case we used a shape charge to deliver an energy surge to the matter stream...
forcing the matter stream to jump to a different Gate, thereby severing the connection.
that could explain the sound they heard...
and the superfluous energy signature that accompanied the matter stream from the first wormhole.
it is some sort of la... - Maybe a supernova.
or a gamma ray burst discharging at the exact millisecond that wormhole passed through that singularity.
it's a one in a billion fluke that ruptured subspace and created the point of confluence that drew the affected realities into this one.
and then to seal the bridge between the multiverse we have to target that point of confluence, basically recreate the circumstances that caused the breach in the first place.
but how is that possible...
you... you said it yourself, it was a one in a billion freak incident.
well the odds would increase significantly if we took the wormhole out of the equation.
then what happens to us?
we'd be stranded here.
I considered not telling you about this.
I understand why you hesitated but you made the right decision...
by sealing the rupture we'll ensure no other teams get stranded here.
that's provided that this actually works.
I mean, we still have one major obstacle to overcome.
how do we deliver an explosive device into the singularity?
we get help from a friend.
Thor sends his apologies for not attending personally, but he and Heimdall are in the neighboring galaxy dealing with a most sensitive matter.
in his stead, I have conveyed the time dilation device as requested.
we appreciate your quick response Vaseer.
so, what do you think will this work?
I prefer not to prognosticate.
well, don't prognosticate just tell us what your gut feeling is.
speculating on the matter would serve no practical purpose.
joseph and Mary...
what are the odds?
less than 12%
and that is provided you are able to in act the plan before the black hole's gravity decimates your ship.
damn that's cold.
Colonel Mitchell. Colonel Carter.
I'm giving it the green light... shut this thing down.
you know I read all the mission reports on the Asgard...
they're not that I expected.
what were you expecting?
well...
pants for one.
the distance between the launch point and the target is crucial and you must be precise in your calculations.
or the proximity of your ship to the singularity could result in a failed mission at best.
certain death at worst.
I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time concentrating.
I understand, you are tired.
allow me to complete the calibration for you.
knock yourself out.
time and again we've managed to save Earth and its allies from the most dire threats...
situations in which we faced unassailable odds...
almost certain defeat but we always managed to find a way to prevail in the end.
I'm sorry...
I wish there was a way I could send you home or...
at the very least delay the mission so... - You have no choice but to do what's best for your world.
I assume yours is not the only SG team in your reality that's actively searching for a cure to the plague...
no.
and I have a feeling that your Samantha Carter is back home working on the problem.
she stopped being my Samantha a long time ago.
I've missed you.
I have completed the calibrations.
thank you Vaseer.
general. Sorry to disturb you, I was wondering if I could have a word.
of course Doctor. Come in.
thank you.
sir, I would like to make a request on behalf of all of the teams stranded in this reality.
please, postpone this mission until we can find a way to get home.
I can't do that.
we need our teams out there gathering intel on the Ori threat...
instead of sitting on their hands here, waiting for normal Gate operations to resume...
and that won't be possible until this problem is dealt with.
well, I can empathize Sir, believe me.
I think you need to take a look at the bigger picture.
this goes beyond this world... beyond this galaxy, this universe.
hundreds of billions of lives are at stake.
their survival could hinge on not just our return but the return of every SG-1 stranded on this base.
sir, back in my universe, Earth is facing a global pandemic, one that your planet has already faced and beaten.
you have the cure that could save my world, all I have to do is get it to them.
I can also empathize but at the risk of sounding callous...
my priorities are with this world.
how can you prioritize the lives of one group over those of another?
what makes my Earth any less important than your own?
we have the top minds from 18 different universes working on a way to get you home.
now hopefully they can come up with a solution before this mission is completed but if they can't...
then I'm sorry Doctor.
we finished loading the warhead and the time dilation generator.
once the system checks are complete, we're good to go...
Where's the crew?
you're looking at it.
given the dangers we may face it was decided that we proceed alone.
so if this plan goes fubar, we're the only ones that goes down with the ship.
well, there's plenty more where we came from, right?
the perilous nature of this mission should not be taken lightly, there is a chance the Prometheus may not survive this voyage but courage and a steadfast resolve will prove the most valuable assets in this undertaking.
well, good luck to you all.
I miss Thor.
of course by the time he actually got around to drinking that orange juice, it would have been sitting in the back of the fridge for what, a month?
Yeah! Yeah yeah! Oh...yep, he was so damn thirsty he knocked it right back, it was a second or two before he actually breathed in, at which point...
spit take of all spit takes! there was orange juice on the table, the chairs...
on Aunt Emma!
aunt Emma! Oh!
Oh! Big old fat Emma sitting across the table...
little bits of bacon on her face orange juice dripping off her nose...
reminiscing over old times?
yeah... hell, I could talk to this guy all day.
no doubt.
you finished your shift?
Yeah, I'm exhausted I'm going to bed.
and you need your beauty sleep.
Woah... who's talking?
so how'd it go?
I found a way round all the security protocols, everything's set.
perfect.
by the time they figure out what happened...
it'll be too late.
show time.
we're approaching the singularity.
calculating minimal prime distance to warhead launch.
come on Carter.
I've got it, relaying the information.
received.
engaging sublight engines, proceeding to co-ordinates.
we've reached the target location.
Yeah, I heard. - Yeah, I think they're just...
circling, like we are parking.
I should warn you...
I've been practicing those Sodan moves.
you were warned.
wouldn't it have been easier just to zat him?
easier yes...
but far less gratifying.
did he just insult me?
what's going on?
there's been a change of flight plans.
you want to tell us what's going on?
we're making an unscheduled detour.
Yeah, just how far out of our way is this little detour gonna take us?
about 3 weeks.
you're planning on taking this ship to Atlantis...
I mean, given the parallels between our two realities, I can't think of anywhere else we'll be going.
as soon as we complete our mission we'll drop you at the nearest habitable planet.
till then have fun.
three weeks, well that gives us time to think of something.
idea's anyone?
it is possible to anticipate their actions and reactions.
all we must do...
is think like them.
well, shouldn't be that hard.
the other colonel Mitchell wishes to speak with you.
you're just going to ignore him for the next three weeks?
you guys seem reasonable...
and you haven't hurt us...
much.
you don't have a beard so you're not from the evil twin universe right?
good.
right, so if I know me like I do...
I'd have a pretty damn good reason to be doing what you guys are doing.
bottom line is, I'd understand better than anyone, so level with me.
what's going on?
let me ask you something.
how far would you go to save the lives of every man and woman on Earth?
don't bother. I already know the answer.
if you were in my situation you would be doing the exact same thing. - What? Going after the ZPM?
come on...
why else would you be going to Atlantis? - Our ZPM is depleted.
we need yours to power the ancient weapon in Antarctica.
Oh right, screw our Earth to save your own. - All that ZPM is doing right now.
is allowing one way travel from the Pegasus galaxy to Earth.
the billions of lives that we save is worth more than the inconvenience - of slopping back and forth on the Daedalus. - We need that ZPM to cloak Atlantis
if the Wraith come back and discover the City wasn't destroyed, they'll launch another attack.
if Atlantis falls, this galaxy is the next target.
if the Wraith return.
if they attack.
if the City is destroyed.
the threat we face is more immediate.
that still doesn't give you the right to do this.
well, say it works.
say that you can beam the ZPM of Atlantis, how do you plan to get it back to your own universe?
you have a way back.
you've planned this all along.
well, we were right, they're going after the ZPM.
you sure you can open the door?
opening the doors the easy part.
it's taking the ship back that'll be tricky.
the armory is this way.
no Teal'c go to the armory on the next level it's less likely you'll be spotted.
Daniel and I will head to the engine room and pull the control crystal, once they come to investigate the problem, we'll get the drop on them there.
very well.
Hey, you had to give it a shot.
I know I would.
so, now that we know how you get out, we'll just have to make sure it doesn't happen again.
no hitting.
so, while we were up here.
we were down on the next level breaking into the other armory.
how did you know I wasn't your Mitchell. - Easy.
if we were in your position we would have done the same thing.
let me get this straight.
we figured that you guys would try to escape and we set this trap for you, not realizing that you'd figure out that we'd figure you out and you'd set your own?
indeed.
now, can you take us to our colonel Mitchell?
Sam disabled the power relay running through these walls so...
I wouldn't bother.
ideas anyone?
sir, it's a subspace communication from the Prometheus.
let's hear it. - Yes Sir.
sir, this is colonel Carter.
good to hear from you Colonel, I take it the mission was a success.
no Sir. In fact we're scraping the mission and heading back home.
Colonel?
sir, I think I figured out a way to send these teams back to their proper realities.
and how do we do that?
by doing exactly the same thing the first team did in order to get here.
you're telling me they planned this from the get-go?
yes Sir, it accounts for the boom you heard and the extra energy signature the Gate diagnostic picked up in the first matter stream.
they opened the wormhole through the black hole and then blasted a bridge into this universe.
ain't that how Carter described it, I don't know, I just remember
wormhole, black hole, blast.
Colonel Carter.
sir, we've established a wormhole to PX7-455.
now, when sergeant Siler is finished, we'll fire the directed energy weapon through the Gate.
if I'm right, it should reverse the space time rupture effectively inverting the convergence effect.
each team gated in from a different point of origin, once the convergence effect has been reversed we'll dial those different points of origin and create wormholes that will follow the inter-universal pathways
ready when you are, Sir.
clear the Gateroom.
I will need the weapon back once your work here is completed.
it is, after all, only on loan to you temporarily.
I know. You'll get it back when we're done.
lower the blast doors.
fire the weapon.
we have a stable wormhole, 3. 4 seconds, it worked.
open the blast doors. Bring them in.
when the time comes, cut the green one.
what the hell did that mean?
I don't know.
but I've the feeling that someday you're going to find out.
have all the other teams left, Sir?
you're the last ones to go.
it was nice working with you again Sam.
your presence has been sorely missed on our team.
just out of curiosity, where did I go?
maternity leave.
we have something for you.
the cure to the Prior's plague.
thank you General.
it's good to see you again.
you too.
may it not be the last time.
well, we'd love to stay...
but we have a planet to save.
Bye.
Merlin was conducting research on some kind of
a weapon capable of destroying ascended beings.
here lies Meardon. Archmage of the realm.
his dies.
we've seen it used to download information into someones mind.
you have Merlin's memories.
some of them. Earth, Atlantis and the work he did in this lab.
what is that?
the first step towards creating Merlin's weapon.
I have too many thoughts in my head. I can't concentrate. I get confused.
you have to fight it.
I have to let it happen.
get through the gate! I'll be right behind you.
he was very persuasive.
convert or die. Yeah, I'd say that's very persuasive.
he said nothing of death. Only salvation. Life eternal.
the blessings of the Ori.
he didn't threaten you.
he spoke of the religion.
left this book with us to read and consider.
said he'd be back today to hearour answer.
well you're not alone. This is happening all over the galaxy.
you were saying this Priors claims are false.
we're saying that book's got about as much truth in it as the Da Vinci Code.
Hey, that's what THEY want you to think.
they, they who?
I do not understand.
it's a book from our planet. It's very entertaining, but it is fiction nonetheless.
I wouldn't be so sure.
OK, I think we've gotten a little offpoint here.
what evidence do you have to support your position?
well, we really don't have any. And we can't tell you what to do.
obviously subjugating people by threatening their lives is wrong.
so if you choose to resist, we'll do our very best to try to help you.
not that we can make many promises, but we've seen a number of villages just like this one wiped out.
as I have said, the Prior made no such threats and spoke upon the positive merits of Origin as true salvation.
soft sell. That's a new approach.
the Prior of the Ori returns!!
listen, no matter which way you're gonna come down on this, it's probably best if that Prior doesn't know we're around.
you can hide here.
welcome back
thankyou Tevaris.
have you contemplated your divine right?
we have, Prior.
we wish to hear more of your wisdom.
it is not MY wisdom, but the wisdom of the ages passed onto us by the only true Gods.
hallowed are the Ori.
Adria must have done something to him.
I mean, before turning him into a Prior.
you mean she brainwashed him somehow.
well Daniel would never willingly become one of them like that. Preach their beliefs.
he's damn good at it.
had those people eating out of his hands without issuing one tiny genocidal little threat.
that's what makes me think there's still a little part of Daniel in there somewhere.
he's better than all this!
Yes! But we still have to face the very real possibility that it's not even really Daniel anymore.
having Merlin's consciousness downloaded into his mind, could have overshadowed Daniel completely.
weakened him to the point where Adria could do this.
still, we cannot abandon him.
so what do we do?
we go get him. Try to figure out what happened, try to undo it.
turn him back.
that's going to be very risky.
could be exactly what Adria's hoping for.
she might be using him to get to us.
still... it's Daniel. If there's any chance.
we have no choice.
arian then took of the mask and revealed his face.
your appearance matters not," he said,"Only the truth of spirit in your heart.
blessed are those that follow the path to Origin.
Hey! What took you guys so long?
Carter, we got him.
great! Take us into hyper-space.
I take it the Anti-Prior device is working.
well, he didn't stop us from zatting him.
guys?
what's going on?
we could be asking you.
OK, this is not necessary.
no offence, but have you looked in the mirror lately?
I'm not a threat to YOU.
in case you change your mind, you should know there is someone poised with a finger over a button, waiting to beam you out into space.
we had to let this happen. It's part of the plan.
I'm sorry, we?
Yeah, myself and Merlin.
Oh, so he's still inside you.
ya! You remember back on the planet when Adria and I were fighting it out?
Yeah. Thanks for that, by the way.
ya, it's a good thing you guys got out too, she was way to powerful for me.
sheMerlin's weapon fall into her hands.
I know it's our only chance of destroying the Ori.
you gave in.
more or less.
of course, Origin is designed to channel the energy of it's followers to the Ori.
it's that selfish act of giving that leads one soul to salvation and ultimately to ascension. This is no great secret.
the Book Of Origin says, make yourself one with the path and the journey will lead you to eternity.
were it not forthe power the Ori draw from our belief, the Ancients would have wiped them out long ago.
Why?
you know the answer. You were once ascended.
because they won't tolerate anyone or anything that doesn't follow their collective rules.
they claim not to interfere, but they do manipulate.
they use their power to h oard their knowledge and prevent those beneath them from reaching their level.
she seemed to know everything about me.
she had a tremendous power of persuasion.
it was almost as if I could hear her voice inside my head, t elling me what to believe.
so I let her believe that she was getting to me.
turning me.
Why?
because I needed her to trust me.
and did she? Well I mean, don't get me wrong, you're not a TERRIBLE liar, but you're nowhere near as good as me.
who is?
and Adria could see right through me, so how did you manage to fool her?
I was able to protect Daniel. Make Adria think he had succuumbed to her will.
it was necessary.
in our time together, I've really come to see in you what draws mothers affection.
affection. what?
it's very important to me that we save her together.
of course.
I can feel the difference in you.
it's because you've done so much for me.
showing me the true path.
I'm glad.
and there's so much more I can do for you. And you for me.
so she trusted you enought to turn you into a Prior?
she had to.
why exactly?
because she knew I was her best chance of converting Earth.
and me?
well that would explain why she wanted to believe you, not why she had to.
she had Merlin's weapon, she just didn't know how to finish it.
I thought she knew everything.
she's Human. Her knowledge is still limited.
but Merlin knew how.
it was a quick and easy way to avoid an all out war between the Ori and the Ancients.
she knows the device can be used to wipe out the Ancients, so I told her I would finish it for her.
did you?
not exactly, but close.
I needed to have the rest of my plan in place before I finished it.
which is?
I needed her to make me a Prior.
hello.
so I could steal an Ori ship and fly it through the supergate to the Ori galaxy with the weapon on board and destroy them.
OK, uh, one small flaw in that plan.
I know, there's a wormhole blocking the supergate and that's why I'm here.
I need you guys to shut it down.
he knew he was no match for her.
he couldn't let Merlins unfinished weapon fall into her hands, so he and Merlin came up with a plan to fool Adria into thinking that he had succuumbed to her power.
so he could continue to work on the weapon.
ostensibly, this time for her to use against the Ancients.
he says he still has Merlin's consciousness in his mind.
Merlin even seemed to be speaking on occasion.
Daniel says that's what's protected him from Adria's influence and what's allowed him to convince her to make him a Prior.
why did he need her to make him a Prior?
so he could steal the Ori ship with the weapon onboard and fly it through the supergate.
he wants us to shut down the incoming wormhole so he can dial out.
Yeah, so he says.
you do not believe Daniel Jackson is being truthful.
Oh, I wanna believe him...
that could be exactly what they expect of us.
if Adria really did somehow manage to brainwash Daniel, then...
this whole thing could be an elaborate plot to get us to shut down that wormhole, so more Ori ships can come into our galaxy.
so what do we do?
fellas.
this is new!
Yeah, it's always something isn't it.
gotta tell you though, not your look.
Oh, it is just temporary.
Really?
Yeah! Yeah!
you see when Merlin programmed the Ancient device to download his consciousness into my brain, he gave it a time limit.
see, he knew I could only survive so long with the knowledge and consciousness of two distinct people in one mind, so...
and when he goes?
he's genetically programmed my body and mind to revert back to the state it was in before he was downloaded.
he can DO that?
Yeah, I'm hoping so! I won't look like this anymore.
I won't have any of a Priors special abilities.
unfortunately, I'll just be little old me again.
but that's good news.
Yeah, except I won't be able to fly an Ori ship, it'll be too late to execute the plan and Adria will have Merlin's weapon.
I thought that wasn't finished yet.
it's very close.
all the pieces are there, it just needs to be assembled. Adria will figure it out.
and just when does your chariot turn back into a pumpkin?
I don't have much time. A day or so.
a day?! Kind of risky leaving it this late in the game!
well I didn't have much choice.
it took you guys a little longer to capture me, than I planned, so...
right...
why do we have to do that, again.
well I couldn't actually just come to you, I think Adria might have suspected something.
Yes, I see.
Jack, you have to believe me!
Why?
Why? Well, because. oh, I don't know, the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance?
you know, that old chestnut's getting a little old.
no, no, that part never gets old!
now, you have to shut down that supergate and you have to let me go!
you KNOW how much I hate being told what to do.
Jack, it's me!
what, that's supposed to convince me?! Look at you!
have I ever let you down?! No, don't answer that.
have I ever let you down when it really mattered?
I don't know who I'm really talking to, right now!
not when you were being tortured by Baal, killed, brought back to life, over and over again.
I stood by you the whole time!
alright, just stop!
I don't need to be reminded of that!
we've been around this barbecue a few times.
just because you know the stuff Daniel knows, doesn't mean you're him.
doesn't mean you're telling the truth.
I mean, come on, you've got to know what you're asking me to do.
I do!
you know, there's a bottom line here.
Carter doesn't think it can be done!
yes it can! A mark nine beamed directly behind the gate in the pegasus galaxy will destroy that gate.
the wormhole connection will be broken.
how do you know that?
Hello! Merlin!
Oh yes, Merlin!
Jack, I wish I had proof. I wish I had a way to convince you, but I don't!
now this was the only choice I had and I took it!
it's a good plan. It just happens to hinge on you guys believing in me.
having a little faith. Now I thought, you of all people might!!
Why?! You of all people should know that I don't believe anything anybody says, even if I understand what they're talking about!
Jack! It's me!
yeah?!
he's right, sir.
a mark nine gatebuster beamed directly behind the event horizon, so the force won't be absorbed by the active wormhole.
would destroy the gate and sever the connection.
Yeah. I should have known that.
so, do you believe him now?
I honestly don't know.
well unfortunately, I don't think a polygraph would work in this case.
no, but I'm not worried about that, cos I think we've got something better.
you know, Tealc, the longer I'm gone, the more suspicious Adria is gonna become.
why were you preaching to the villagers on that planet?
what?
I told you, I found out you guys were gonna be there, so I set myself up to be captured.
you misunderstand me, Daniel Jackson.
why is Adria not suspicious of your actions?
you attempt to reform a meaningless planet of people instead of completing the weapon.
actually, she was the one who stopped me before I completed the weapon.
Why?
I'm almost done.
I know. You must stop for now.
you're afraid the Ancients will take the device away from us before we can use it.
they've interfered once before in its creation.
you're using Merlin's knowledge. Knowledge he kept from when he was ascended.
but if I don't finish it...
for now, you must help bring the energy of more followers into the fold.
the original plan was for the Ori to convert our whole galaxy, so that they could build up their power enough to attack the Ancients.
but even then, a conflict on that level was gonna be costly.
but now they have a weapon that could destroy all ascended beings within the scope of an entire galaxy in one fell swoop.
they just need to distract the Ancients for long enough so that they can use it.
engage them in battle long enough to complete the weapon.
then back off to safety while Adria detonates it.
if the Ancients perceive this weapon as a threat, why not intervene and simply take it now?
I have no idea. I mean, maybe they wanna give my plan a chance to work.
either way, the Ori believe they still need more power to maximize their chances for success.
more power. That means they will need more followers.
exactly. Adria's out working hard for the cause, which leaves me the perfect opportunity to steal the ship with the weapon on it.
if you guys would just believe I am still on your side!
we're running out of time.
I believe Daniel Jackson speaks the truth.
lot of good it's gonna do us.
I'll let you tell 'em yourself, because I don'thave the stomach for it.
that's alright sir, General O'Neill filled usin. The IOA has nixed the whole thing.
no, I don't think you know everything.
I...
you have to understand.
we've consideredall the evidence at our disposal.
but more than that, asdifficult as this is,
I feel very strongly that we haveno viable option.
you wanna get to the point?
I assure you, this may be the hardest decisionI'll ever make, but I take full responsibility for it.
based on my recommendation, the IOA has proposed to thePresident that Daniel Jackson's life be terminated.
immediately.
so, what the hell is going on?
this and that. You know, the usual.
you'll neverbelieve what's happening on One Life To Live.
you know, I really hate to press the issue here, but I do have a deadline.
Oh, so do we.
Oh yes, before I figure out how to overcome theeffects of the Anti Prior device.
I thoughtTeal'c believed me!
Oh he does.
Jack?
no, he's on your side too.
that little weasel manwho somehow represents your government?
I can't be certain, but I think he might not likeyou.
he wants to have me killed, doesn't he.
well, I'm not sure how serious he is. He seemsquite the prankster to me.
you know, I was afraid of that.
he was the onewho argued to keep Kalek alive and got burned for it.
uh, Anubis' highly evolved half breed son. Twopeople died as a result.
it could have been much worse.
now that you mention it, that seems to be inplay.
but not to worry, if it comes down to it, I have aplan.
Oh, you have a plan!
great.
what is it?
well, when I said that I had a plan, I meant thatI have to plan the plan.
so when or rather if it comesdown to it, I will have a plan.
I've cleared my wholeafternoon for planning.
you believe me, right?
now I don't believe YOU
imagine our positions were reversed.
what wouldyou do?
I know you've trusted me even when you've hadevery reason not to.
but perhaps I'm the only one whoknows how dangerous and powerful Adria is.
there's noevidence. Only your word.
and that should beenough...
but this is so big.
well I wouldn't let them KILL you.
of course not.
I won't let that happen to you.
Butwould you support me if what I was proposing, couldfinally open the door to the final Ori victory?
not ifthere was the slightest chance that I wasn't on thelevel.
even if it was the tiniest nagging doubt?
that's a load of crap! You're wasting our time!
doctor Jackson was the one who suggested weshould kill Kalek.
he WAS the demon spawn of Anubis!
and Doctor Jackson is now potentially an evenbigger threat.
I think the operative word there is, potentially.
we don't know exactly what's going on yet.
and by the time we do, it may be too late!
Weknow that Anti Prior device will only subdue his powersfor a limited time.
after that, you won't be able tocontrol him.
alright, listen to me closely, cos I'm only gonnasay this once.
you kill Daniel, over my dead body!
obviously, we need to discuss some realisticoptions.
we can't hold Doctor Jackson long term and wecan't release him, given what he knows.
if he has fallen under their influence, the Orimost likely know everything they can learn from him, already.
what are you suggesting?
doctor Jackson claims he'll revert back to hisold self in short order.
we only need to hold him longenough to see if that's true.
if it's not, we still havethe option of placing him in stasis.
if he hasn't already caused a major catastropheby then.
Oh, will you stop it!
if he is telling the truth, then we've blown the best chance we've ever had ofbeating the bad guys.
how's it going, sir?
longing for the days when I actually carried aweapon.
what do you got?
a crazy idea.
I'm down with crazy. I like crazy.
crazy and I arelike that!
he crosses his fingersCam likes crazy, too.
listen, if what Jackson is saying is true, there is an Ori ship out there with a near completeweapon on it that could prove useful against the Ori.
ithink we should go after it.
you're right, that's crazy!
I'm just saying, if they're not gonna letJackson complete his mission, there is no reason that weshouldn't try.
Daniel Jackson may be able to provide us with the intelligence required to ensure the success for thismission.
he might be able to tell us where the ship isand how to get aboard undetected.
and he must have enough knowledge of theirtechnology by now to provide me with what I need to interface with the ships control systems.
assuming he tells you.
well why wouldn't he?
if he knows he's not going anywhere.
that's crazy!
that's what I said. It's crazy, it's nuts, it'swacko!
but let's be honest, what isn't.
Jack, I'm the only one who should be going. It'stoo dangerous for anyone else.
not if you give me the intel we need!
it's my plan!
it was a bad one!
come on Daniel!
you had to knowwe weren't gonna shut down that supergate for you.
we had no choice.
Oh,
you've been in my position before.
well, notthis one, but... similar!
Yes, I'm sure I have, but my brains been messedwith so much over the years, I don't remember.
wait a second! With your way, you'll still haveto shut down the supergate.
come on! Where's the ship!
how does Carter fly it?
give me any other intel Imight need to make this op a success. Come on!
I'm trusting you.
Oh yes, I really feel the faith!
well now you have to trust US.
let us finish whatyou started.
the Ori ship containing Merlin's weapon is parkedin orbit around a planet with a gate.
we gate to the planet, use the rings to getaboard.
there is a Prior onboard the ship, but hepreaches to the masses daily.
I thought only a Prior could fly one of thoseships.
the systems are activated using mind control.
Daniel's given me what I need to get around it.
he's also given us instructions on how to put thefinal pieces together.
Daedalus will be standing by in Pegasus to shutdown the wormhole.
we use the Ori ship to dial out and we send theweapon through.
but not before the Odyssey beams us off.
now that's a plan!
that depends entirely on Daniel Jacksons word.
we will know whether he's on the level, beforewe shut off the supergate.
so at this point, the onlything at risk, is us.
no gun.
did you bring lethal injection, high voltage or just gonna have them beam me out intospace.
I think you understand my position.
I gave Jack the information you asked for.
and you will be frozen in stasis until suchtime that SG1's mission is deemed successful.
I take it then, you're not gonna allow me tojust turn back into my old self.
if the intel turns out to be reliable, you willbe unfrozen and allowed to resume transforming.
if thatindeed, is going to happen.
I see.
I'm here out of respect for you.
I wanted toexplain personally that we're about to beam you into theAncient Pod in Antarctica.
OK.
you're clear to beam the prisoner out now.
what's the hold up?
we're having some technical problems. We can'tseem to get a lock.
not part of my plan.
I've always been the one that caused the worry, not the worrier.
it's not easy. Don't second guess yourself.
thisis the best possible course of action.
Exactly! Action, good!
sitting around, bad.
if it makes you feel any better, I still worrysometimes, too.
about you. - Well thankyou, sir.
don't mention it.
I thought we fixed this thing so that wouldn'thappen anymore.
what's up?
Oh, I'm taking the ship.
well, I see that.
Yeah, I've beamed the crew safely to thesurface.
nice for them.
but as you probably figured out by now, I'mgoing to need YOU.
you know, I was just thinking how much I missedbeing needed.
alright fellas, here's the deal.
we arecommandeering this ship!
we'd like for you to throw downyour weapons and surrender please!
that's a no.
we asked nicely. Mitchell and Vala find the weapon Daniel wasconstructing.
OK.
this shouldn't be too bad.
I don't know.
for me, whenever there's someassembly required,
I inevitably find some part missing.
a screw, widget, what have you.
well, according to Daniel's instructions, it allseems to be here.
ah well, never follow instructions.
think that could be part of the problem?
are we clear? - For the moment.
OK, I've locked out the rings and secured thislevel. We shouldn't have any more company.
hang on guys. If this works, we're about to jumpinto hyperspace.
Yep!
just like old times.
except, I'm here against my will and you look likeMarcel Marceau.
Yeah. You know, some things change, but othersstay the same.
they do.
why did you bother giving me the intel ifyou were gonna bust out anyway?
well obviously I'm improvising at this point.
ihad no idea when or even if I was going to be able toovercome the effects of the Anti Prior device.
time wasrunning out.
Adria was gonna notice my absence andbecome suspicious, so sending the rest of SG1 to get thedevice was my only choice at the time.
then why do this now?
because I'm afraid the rest of the team won't beable to complete the mission without me.
Oh! Aren't we full of ourselves.
that and I wasn't about to let Woolsey freezeme.
that I understand. - Yeah.
there.
I think that's about it.
what's this?
Oh, I'm not sure about that one.
you see? There is always a widget left over.
I thought you were always one short?
well you'd think both was impossible, but it'snot.
right.
actually, I'm pretty sure that's a timingcrystal that sets the detonation of the weapon fiveminutes after it's inserted.
right, hold on that.
Carter, status.
vala, Cam, we're moments from exiting hyper - space.
Roger that, we're almost done here. Check that, uh, Vala's almost done, I stillhave my doubts.
and that means?
that means the weapon's ready to be activated.
what?
Oh, I was just wondering if an ascended being wasgonna swoop down and take it away.
I guess they don't mind us doing their dirtywork for 'em.
or. .
or what?
or there's no point because I've assembled itwrongly and it's not going to work.
Colonel Carter.
Yeah, I see it. It just came up on the shipssensors.
we have a problem.
what's it doing?
it seems to be just sitting there blocking our way. I'm trying to raise shields.
hi there!
Carter, I thought you sealed off this leveland locked out the rings.
me too.
I was afraid of that. Adria must haveanticipated my plan.
they're gonna detect us. We're cloaked.
this ship doesn't have that.
it does now. Having a ZPM helps.
when the timecomes, give the order to Daedalus.
we'll see.
I should never have trusted you.
they're about to shut down the supergate andallow our ships through.
they've assembled the weaponand the Ancients didn't interfere.
right?
you did exactly as I said, right?
Daniel, what are you doing?
we can destroy the Ancients right now and theOri won't even have to fight.
I've done all of this foryou.
your mind is closed to me.
Yeah.
what the hell is going on?
sorry about that. I had to be sure this wasworking on her first.
he has the Anti Prior deviceYou got past her personal shield.
Yeah. That took a lot.
are you alright, Daniel Jackson?
Yeah. A little dizzy.
look, I don't have muchtime left. Go arm the device.
Jack's onboard Odyssey, he's gonna shut down the gate. Now go!
Jack, give the command.
please! I'm running out of strength to do this.
this is General Jack O'Neill.
so what's going on?
Daniel's flying the ship. - Daniel?
he wishes us to arm the weapon.
general O'Neill's onboard the Odyssey.
And? - Do it.
we gotta go!
sir, if you can hear me, we need to beam out now!
what about Adria
hey sleepyhead!
what took you so long?
what happened? - Nothing. Why?
we armed the weapon, you dialled the gate andsent the Ori ship through.
assuming it IS you.
no, it's me.
Merlin's gone. He sacrificedhimself for this to work.
yeah?
prove it!
what the hell was that?
if I was Merlin, you would know. What aboutAdria?
still on the ship.
alright, here's a question.
how do we know itworked?
well we don't. Not yet.
I think, if it did work, the Ancients would feelobligate to get us a fruit basket or like, a giftcertificate or...
something like that.
maybe the reason they let us do it is because theyknew it wouldn't work.
or because they knew and wanted it to.
there'sno point in guessing.
even if it is successful, there are still agreat many Priors with great power and vast armies ofwarriors bent on converting this galaxy.
it will be verydifficult to convince them that their Gods are dead.
if they're dead.
Carter! Sunshine is awake!
that's good. Is he ok?
well he's grumpy.
can you ask him how he managed to cloak the ship?
he said, Magicians don't reveal their secrets.
is that Ori ship still hanging around out there?
Yeah, it's still out there.
I sent a message toEarth, telling them that we were going...
uh, guys? You'd better get up here.
incoming wormhole
I think that went well!
we knew limiting the Ori, might not stop theirfollowers.
I still think it was the right thing to do.
we may have made things worse, right now.
butin the long run, it could be our only chance to win thewar.
Merlin was conducting research on some kind of
a weapon capable of destroying ascended beings.
here lies Meardon. Archmage of the realm.
his dies.
we've seen it used to download information into someones mind.
you have Merlin's memories.
some of them. Earth, Atlantis and the work he did in this lab.
what is that?
the first step towards creating Merlin's weapon.
I have too many thoughts in my head. I can't concentrate. I get confused.
you have to fight it.
I have to let it happen.
get through the gate! I'll be right behind you.
he was very persuasive.
convert or die. Yeah, I'd say that's very persuasive.
he said nothing of death. Only salvation. Life eternal.
the blessings of the Ori.
he didn't threaten you.
he spoke of the religion.
left this book with us to read and consider.
said he'd be back today to hearour answer.
well you're not alone. This is happening all over the galaxy.
you were saying this Priors claims are false.
we're saying that book's got about as much truth in it as the Da Vinci Code.
Hey, that's what THEY want you to think.
they, they who?
I do not understand.
it's a book from our planet. It's very entertaining, but it is fiction nonetheless.
I wouldn't be so sure.
OK, I think we've gotten a little offpoint here.
what evidence do you have to support your position?
well, we really don't have any. And we can't tell you what to do.
obviously subjugating people by threatening their lives is wrong.
so if you choose to resist, we'll do our very best to try to help you.
not that we can make many promises, but we've seen a number of villages just like this one wiped out.
as I have said, the Prior made no such threats and spoke upon the positive merits of Origin as true salvation.
soft sell. That's a new approach.
the Prior of the Ori returns!!
listen, no matter which way you're gonna come down on this, it's probably best if that Prior doesn't know we're around.
you can hide here.
welcome back
thankyou Tevaris.
have you contemplated your divine right?
we have, Prior.
we wish to hear more of your wisdom.
it is not MY wisdom, but the wisdom of the ages passed onto us by the only true Gods.
hallowed are the Ori.
Adria must have done something to him.
I mean, before turning him into a Prior.
you mean she brainwashed him somehow.
well Daniel would never willingly become one of them like that. Preach their beliefs.
he's damn good at it.
had those people eating out of his hands without issuing one tiny genocidal little threat.
that's what makes me think there's still a little part of Daniel in there somewhere.
he's better than all this!
Yes! But we still have to face the very real possibility that it's not even really Daniel anymore.
having Merlin's consciousness downloaded into his mind, could have overshadowed Daniel completely.
weakened him to the point where Adria could do this.
still, we cannot abandon him.
so what do we do?
we go get him. Try to figure out what happened, try to undo it.
turn him back.
that's going to be very risky.
could be exactly what Adria's hoping for.
she might be using him to get to us.
still... it's Daniel. If there's any chance.
we have no choice.
arian then took of the mask and revealed his face.
your appearance matters not," he said,"Only the truth of spirit in your heart.
blessed are those that follow the path to Origin.
Hey! What took you guys so long?
Carter, we got him.
great! Take us into hyper-space.
I take it the Anti-Prior device is working.
well, he didn't stop us from zatting him.
guys?
what's going on?
we could be asking you.
OK, this is not necessary.
no offence, but have you looked in the mirror lately?
I'm not a threat to YOU.
in case you change your mind, you should know there is someone poised with a finger over a button, waiting to beam you out into space.
we had to let this happen. It's part of the plan.
I'm sorry, we?
Yeah, myself and Merlin.
Oh, so he's still inside you.
ya! You remember back on the planet when Adria and I were fighting it out?
Yeah. Thanks for that, by the way.
ya, it's a good thing you guys got out too, she was way to powerful for me.
sheMerlin's weapon fall into her hands.
I know it's our only chance of destroying the Ori.
you gave in.
more or less.
of course, Origin is designed to channel the energy of it's followers to the Ori.
it's that selfish act of giving that leads one soul to salvation and ultimately to ascension. This is no great secret.
the Book Of Origin says, make yourself one with the path and the journey will lead you to eternity.
were it not forthe power the Ori draw from our belief, the Ancients would have wiped them out long ago.
Why?
you know the answer. You were once ascended.
because they won't tolerate anyone or anything that doesn't follow their collective rules.
they claim not to interfere, but they do manipulate.
they use their power to h oard their knowledge and prevent those beneath them from reaching their level.
she seemed to know everything about me.
she had a tremendous power of persuasion.
it was almost as if I could hear her voice inside my head, t elling me what to believe.
so I let her believe that she was getting to me.
turning me.
Why?
because I needed her to trust me.
and did she? Well I mean, don't get me wrong, you're not a TERRIBLE liar, but you're nowhere near as good as me.
who is?
and Adria could see right through me, so how did you manage to fool her?
I was able to protect Daniel. Make Adria think he had succuumbed to her will.
it was necessary.
in our time together, I've really come to see in you what draws mothers affection.
affection. what?
it's very important to me that we save her together.
of course.
I can feel the difference in you.
it's because you've done so much for me.
showing me the true path.
I'm glad.
and there's so much more I can do for you. And you for me.
so she trusted you enought to turn you into a Prior?
she had to.
why exactly?
because she knew I was her best chance of converting Earth.
and me?
well that would explain why she wanted to believe you, not why she had to.
she had Merlin's weapon, she just didn't know how to finish it.
I thought she knew everything.
she's Human. Her knowledge is still limited.
but Merlin knew how.
it was a quick and easy way to avoid an all out war between the Ori and the Ancients.
she knows the device can be used to wipe out the Ancients, so I told her I would finish it for her.
did you?
not exactly, but close.
I needed to have the rest of my plan in place before I finished it.
which is?
I needed her to make me a Prior.
hello.
so I could steal an Ori ship and fly it through the supergate to the Ori galaxy with the weapon on board and destroy them.
OK, uh, one small flaw in that plan.
I know, there's a wormhole blocking the supergate and that's why I'm here.
I need you guys to shut it down.
he knew he was no match for her.
he couldn't let Merlins unfinished weapon fall into her hands, so he and Merlin came up with a plan to fool Adria into thinking that he had succuumbed to her power.
so he could continue to work on the weapon.
ostensibly, this time for her to use against the Ancients.
he says he still has Merlin's consciousness in his mind.
Merlin even seemed to be speaking on occasion.
Daniel says that's what's protected him from Adria's influence and what's allowed him to convince her to make him a Prior.
why did he need her to make him a Prior?
so he could steal the Ori ship with the weapon onboard and fly it through the supergate.
he wants us to shut down the incoming wormhole so he can dial out.
Yeah, so he says.
you do not believe Daniel Jackson is being truthful.
Oh, I wanna believe him...
that could be exactly what they expect of us.
if Adria really did somehow manage to brainwash Daniel, then...
this whole thing could be an elaborate plot to get us to shut down that wormhole, so more Ori ships can come into our galaxy.
so what do we do?
fellas.
this is new!
Yeah, it's always something isn't it.
gotta tell you though, not your look.
Oh, it is just temporary.
Really?
Yeah! Yeah!
you see when Merlin programmed the Ancient device to download his consciousness into my brain, he gave it a time limit.
see, he knew I could only survive so long with the knowledge and consciousness of two distinct people in one mind, so...
and when he goes?
he's genetically programmed my body and mind to revert back to the state it was in before he was downloaded.
he can DO that?
Yeah, I'm hoping so! I won't look like this anymore.
I won't have any of a Priors special abilities.
unfortunately, I'll just be little old me again.
but that's good news.
Yeah, except I won't be able to fly an Ori ship, it'll be too late to execute the plan and Adria will have Merlin's weapon.
I thought that wasn't finished yet.
it's very close.
all the pieces are there, it just needs to be assembled. Adria will figure it out.
and just when does your chariot turn back into a pumpkin?
I don't have much time. A day or so.
a day?! Kind of risky leaving it this late in the game!
well I didn't have much choice.
it took you guys a little longer to capture me, than I planned, so...
right...
why do we have to do that, again.
well I couldn't actually just come to you, I think Adria might have suspected something.
Yes, I see.
Jack, you have to believe me!
Why?
Why? Well, because. oh, I don't know, the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance?
you know, that old chestnut's getting a little old.
no, no, that part never gets old!
now, you have to shut down that supergate and you have to let me go!
you KNOW how much I hate being told what to do.
Jack, it's me!
what, that's supposed to convince me?! Look at you!
have I ever let you down?! No, don't answer that.
have I ever let you down when it really mattered?
I don't know who I'm really talking to, right now!
not when you were being tortured by Baal, killed, brought back to life, over and over again.
I stood by you the whole time!
alright, just stop!
I don't need to be reminded of that!
we've been around this barbecue a few times.
just because you know the stuff Daniel knows, doesn't mean you're him.
doesn't mean you're telling the truth.
I mean, come on, you've got to know what you're asking me to do.
I do!
you know, there's a bottom line here.
Carter doesn't think it can be done!
yes it can! A mark nine beamed directly behind the gate in the pegasus galaxy will destroy that gate.
the wormhole connection will be broken.
how do you know that?
Hello! Merlin!
Oh yes, Merlin!
Jack, I wish I had proof. I wish I had a way to convince you, but I don't!
now this was the only choice I had and I took it!
it's a good plan. It just happens to hinge on you guys believing in me.
having a little faith. Now I thought, you of all people might!!
Why?! You of all people should know that I don't believe anything anybody says, even if I understand what they're talking about!
Jack! It's me!
yeah?!
he's right, sir.
a mark nine gatebuster beamed directly behind the event horizon, so the force won't be absorbed by the active wormhole.
would destroy the gate and sever the connection.
Yeah. I should have known that.
so, do you believe him now?
I honestly don't know.
well unfortunately, I don't think a polygraph would work in this case.
no, but I'm not worried about that, cos I think we've got something better.
you know, Tealc, the longer I'm gone, the more suspicious Adria is gonna become.
why were you preaching to the villagers on that planet?
what?
I told you, I found out you guys were gonna be there, so I set myself up to be captured.
you misunderstand me, Daniel Jackson.
why is Adria not suspicious of your actions?
you attempt to reform a meaningless planet of people instead of completing the weapon.
actually, she was the one who stopped me before I completed the weapon.
Why?
I'm almost done.
I know. You must stop for now.
you're afraid the Ancients will take the device away from us before we can use it.
they've interfered once before in its creation.
you're using Merlin's knowledge. Knowledge he kept from when he was ascended.
but if I don't finish it...
for now, you must help bring the energy of more followers into the fold.
the original plan was for the Ori to convert our whole galaxy, so that they could build up their power enough to attack the Ancients.
but even then, a conflict on that level was gonna be costly.
but now they have a weapon that could destroy all ascended beings within the scope of an entire galaxy in one fell swoop.
they just need to distract the Ancients for long enough so that they can use it.
engage them in battle long enough to complete the weapon.
then back off to safety while Adria detonates it.
if the Ancients perceive this weapon as a threat, why not intervene and simply take it now?
I have no idea. I mean, maybe they wanna give my plan a chance to work.
either way, the Ori believe they still need more power to maximize their chances for success.
more power. That means they will need more followers.
exactly. Adria's out working hard for the cause, which leaves me the perfect opportunity to steal the ship with the weapon on it.
if you guys would just believe I am still on your side!
we're running out of time.
I believe Daniel Jackson speaks the truth.
lot of good it's gonna do us.
I'll let you tell 'em yourself, because I don'thave the stomach for it.
that's alright sir, General O'Neill filled usin. The IOA has nixed the whole thing.
no, I don't think you know everything.
I...
you have to understand.
we've consideredall the evidence at our disposal.
but more than that, asdifficult as this is,
I feel very strongly that we haveno viable option.
you wanna get to the point?
I assure you, this may be the hardest decisionI'll ever make, but I take full responsibility for it.
based on my recommendation, the IOA has proposed to thePresident that Daniel Jackson's life be terminated.
immediately.
so, what the hell is going on?
this and that. You know, the usual.
you'll neverbelieve what's happening on One Life To Live.
you know, I really hate to press the issue here, but I do have a deadline.
Oh, so do we.
Oh yes, before I figure out how to overcome theeffects of the Anti Prior device.
I thoughtTeal'c believed me!
Oh he does.
Jack?
no, he's on your side too.
that little weasel manwho somehow represents your government?
I can't be certain, but I think he might not likeyou.
he wants to have me killed, doesn't he.
well, I'm not sure how serious he is. He seemsquite the prankster to me.
you know, I was afraid of that.
he was the onewho argued to keep Kalek alive and got burned for it.
uh, Anubis' highly evolved half breed son. Twopeople died as a result.
it could have been much worse.
now that you mention it, that seems to be inplay.
but not to worry, if it comes down to it, I have aplan.
Oh, you have a plan!
great.
what is it?
well, when I said that I had a plan, I meant thatI have to plan the plan.
so when or rather if it comesdown to it, I will have a plan.
I've cleared my wholeafternoon for planning.
you believe me, right?
now I don't believe YOU
imagine our positions were reversed.
what wouldyou do?
I know you've trusted me even when you've hadevery reason not to.
but perhaps I'm the only one whoknows how dangerous and powerful Adria is.
there's noevidence. Only your word.
and that should beenough...
but this is so big.
well I wouldn't let them KILL you.
of course not.
I won't let that happen to you.
Butwould you support me if what I was proposing, couldfinally open the door to the final Ori victory?
not ifthere was the slightest chance that I wasn't on thelevel.
even if it was the tiniest nagging doubt?
that's a load of crap! You're wasting our time!
doctor Jackson was the one who suggested weshould kill Kalek.
he WAS the demon spawn of Anubis!
and Doctor Jackson is now potentially an evenbigger threat.
I think the operative word there is, potentially.
we don't know exactly what's going on yet.
and by the time we do, it may be too late!
Weknow that Anti Prior device will only subdue his powersfor a limited time.
after that, you won't be able tocontrol him.
alright, listen to me closely, cos I'm only gonnasay this once.
you kill Daniel, over my dead body!
obviously, we need to discuss some realisticoptions.
we can't hold Doctor Jackson long term and wecan't release him, given what he knows.
if he has fallen under their influence, the Orimost likely know everything they can learn from him, already.
what are you suggesting?
doctor Jackson claims he'll revert back to hisold self in short order.
we only need to hold him longenough to see if that's true.
if it's not, we still havethe option of placing him in stasis.
if he hasn't already caused a major catastropheby then.
Oh, will you stop it!
if he is telling the truth, then we've blown the best chance we've ever had ofbeating the bad guys.
how's it going, sir?
longing for the days when I actually carried aweapon.
what do you got?
a crazy idea.
I'm down with crazy. I like crazy.
crazy and I arelike that!
he crosses his fingersCam likes crazy, too.
listen, if what Jackson is saying is true, there is an Ori ship out there with a near completeweapon on it that could prove useful against the Ori.
ithink we should go after it.
you're right, that's crazy!
I'm just saying, if they're not gonna letJackson complete his mission, there is no reason that weshouldn't try.
Daniel Jackson may be able to provide us with the intelligence required to ensure the success for thismission.
he might be able to tell us where the ship isand how to get aboard undetected.
and he must have enough knowledge of theirtechnology by now to provide me with what I need to interface with the ships control systems.
assuming he tells you.
well why wouldn't he?
if he knows he's not going anywhere.
that's crazy!
that's what I said. It's crazy, it's nuts, it'swacko!
but let's be honest, what isn't.
Jack, I'm the only one who should be going. It'stoo dangerous for anyone else.
not if you give me the intel we need!
it's my plan!
it was a bad one!
come on Daniel!
you had to knowwe weren't gonna shut down that supergate for you.
we had no choice.
Oh,
you've been in my position before.
well, notthis one, but... similar!
Yes, I'm sure I have, but my brains been messedwith so much over the years, I don't remember.
wait a second! With your way, you'll still haveto shut down the supergate.
come on! Where's the ship!
how does Carter fly it?
give me any other intel Imight need to make this op a success. Come on!
I'm trusting you.
Oh yes, I really feel the faith!
well now you have to trust US.
let us finish whatyou started.
the Ori ship containing Merlin's weapon is parkedin orbit around a planet with a gate.
we gate to the planet, use the rings to getaboard.
there is a Prior onboard the ship, but hepreaches to the masses daily.
I thought only a Prior could fly one of thoseships.
the systems are activated using mind control.
Daniel's given me what I need to get around it.
he's also given us instructions on how to put thefinal pieces together.
Daedalus will be standing by in Pegasus to shutdown the wormhole.
we use the Ori ship to dial out and we send theweapon through.
but not before the Odyssey beams us off.
now that's a plan!
that depends entirely on Daniel Jacksons word.
we will know whether he's on the level, beforewe shut off the supergate.
so at this point, the onlything at risk, is us.
no gun.
did you bring lethal injection, high voltage or just gonna have them beam me out intospace.
I think you understand my position.
I gave Jack the information you asked for.
and you will be frozen in stasis until suchtime that SG1's mission is deemed successful.
I take it then, you're not gonna allow me tojust turn back into my old self.
if the intel turns out to be reliable, you willbe unfrozen and allowed to resume transforming.
if thatindeed, is going to happen.
I see.
I'm here out of respect for you.
I wanted toexplain personally that we're about to beam you into theAncient Pod in Antarctica.
OK.
you're clear to beam the prisoner out now.
what's the hold up?
we're having some technical problems. We can'tseem to get a lock.
not part of my plan.
I've always been the one that caused the worry, not the worrier.
it's not easy. Don't second guess yourself.
thisis the best possible course of action.
Exactly! Action, good!
sitting around, bad.
if it makes you feel any better, I still worrysometimes, too.
about you. - Well thankyou, sir.
don't mention it.
I thought we fixed this thing so that wouldn'thappen anymore.
what's up?
Oh, I'm taking the ship.
well, I see that.
Yeah, I've beamed the crew safely to thesurface.
nice for them.
but as you probably figured out by now, I'mgoing to need YOU.
you know, I was just thinking how much I missedbeing needed.
alright fellas, here's the deal.
we arecommandeering this ship!
we'd like for you to throw downyour weapons and surrender please!
that's a no.
we asked nicely. Mitchell and Vala find the weapon Daniel wasconstructing.
OK.
this shouldn't be too bad.
I don't know.
for me, whenever there's someassembly required,
I inevitably find some part missing.
a screw, widget, what have you.
well, according to Daniel's instructions, it allseems to be here.
ah well, never follow instructions.
think that could be part of the problem?
are we clear? - For the moment.
OK, I've locked out the rings and secured thislevel. We shouldn't have any more company.
hang on guys. If this works, we're about to jumpinto hyperspace.
Yep!
just like old times.
except, I'm here against my will and you look likeMarcel Marceau.
Yeah. You know, some things change, but othersstay the same.
they do.
why did you bother giving me the intel ifyou were gonna bust out anyway?
well obviously I'm improvising at this point.
ihad no idea when or even if I was going to be able toovercome the effects of the Anti Prior device.
time wasrunning out.
Adria was gonna notice my absence andbecome suspicious, so sending the rest of SG1 to get thedevice was my only choice at the time.
then why do this now?
because I'm afraid the rest of the team won't beable to complete the mission without me.
Oh! Aren't we full of ourselves.
that and I wasn't about to let Woolsey freezeme.
that I understand. - Yeah.
there.
I think that's about it.
what's this?
Oh, I'm not sure about that one.
you see? There is always a widget left over.
I thought you were always one short?
well you'd think both was impossible, but it'snot.
right.
actually, I'm pretty sure that's a timingcrystal that sets the detonation of the weapon fiveminutes after it's inserted.
right, hold on that.
Carter, status.
vala, Cam, we're moments from exiting hyper - space.
Roger that, we're almost done here. Check that, uh, Vala's almost done, I stillhave my doubts.
and that means?
that means the weapon's ready to be activated.
what?
Oh, I was just wondering if an ascended being wasgonna swoop down and take it away.
I guess they don't mind us doing their dirtywork for 'em.
or. .
or what?
or there's no point because I've assembled itwrongly and it's not going to work.
Colonel Carter.
Yeah, I see it. It just came up on the shipssensors.
we have a problem.
what's it doing?
it seems to be just sitting there blocking our way. I'm trying to raise shields.
hi there!
Carter, I thought you sealed off this leveland locked out the rings.
me too.
I was afraid of that. Adria must haveanticipated my plan.
they're gonna detect us. We're cloaked.
this ship doesn't have that.
it does now. Having a ZPM helps.
when the timecomes, give the order to Daedalus.
we'll see.
I should never have trusted you.
they're about to shut down the supergate andallow our ships through.
they've assembled the weaponand the Ancients didn't interfere.
right?
you did exactly as I said, right?
Daniel, what are you doing?
we can destroy the Ancients right now and theOri won't even have to fight.
I've done all of this foryou.
your mind is closed to me.
Yeah.
what the hell is going on?
sorry about that. I had to be sure this wasworking on her first.
he has the Anti Prior deviceYou got past her personal shield.
Yeah. That took a lot.
are you alright, Daniel Jackson?
Yeah. A little dizzy.
look, I don't have muchtime left. Go arm the device.
Jack's onboard Odyssey, he's gonna shut down the gate. Now go!
Jack, give the command.
please! I'm running out of strength to do this.
this is General Jack O'Neill.
so what's going on?
Daniel's flying the ship. - Daniel?
he wishes us to arm the weapon.
general O'Neill's onboard the Odyssey.
And? - Do it.
we gotta go!
sir, if you can hear me, we need to beam out now!
what about Adria
hey sleepyhead!
what took you so long?
what happened? - Nothing. Why?
we armed the weapon, you dialled the gate andsent the Ori ship through.
assuming it IS you.
no, it's me.
Merlin's gone. He sacrificedhimself for this to work.
yeah?
prove it!
what the hell was that?
if I was Merlin, you would know. What aboutAdria?
still on the ship.
alright, here's a question.
how do we know itworked?
well we don't. Not yet.
I think, if it did work, the Ancients would feelobligate to get us a fruit basket or like, a giftcertificate or...
something like that.
maybe the reason they let us do it is because theyknew it wouldn't work.
or because they knew and wanted it to.
there'sno point in guessing.
even if it is successful, there are still agreat many Priors with great power and vast armies ofwarriors bent on converting this galaxy.
it will be verydifficult to convince them that their Gods are dead.
if they're dead.
Carter! Sunshine is awake!
that's good. Is he ok?
well he's grumpy.
can you ask him how he managed to cloak the ship?
he said, Magicians don't reveal their secrets.
is that Ori ship still hanging around out there?
Yeah, it's still out there.
I sent a message toEarth, telling them that we were going...
uh, guys? You'd better get up here.
incoming wormhole
I think that went well!
we knew limiting the Ori, might not stop theirfollowers.
I still think it was the right thing to do.
we may have made things worse, right now.
butin the long run, it could be our only chance to win thewar.
what exactly do you want from me?
the code to an Ancient tablet, that I helped Quetesh locate, long ago.
I take it the anti-Prior device is working?
well, he didn't stop us from zatting him.
what the hell's going on?
I had to be sure this was working on her, first.
we gotta go!
you're bluffing.
you have nothing.
I tell you what.
I'll bet you everything I have on this table, against that cargo ship of yours, outside.
your winnings wouldn't cover the value of that ship.
what if I throw in this?
and what's that supposed to be?
you've got your wager. As foolish as it may be.
I guess it's just my lucky day.
I thought this was an HONEST establishment.
it is.
and that's why it's necessary to have you searched.
I don't suppose we could call this even?
Hello, mother.
it's good to see you. It's been far too long.
I... did not expect...
to see you again.
I had to return, mother.
my work here is unfinished.
who is this?
you REALLY don't wanna know.
get out, all of you!
I don't suppose you're gonna let me just walk out of here.
I'm afraid not.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, mother, but your attempt to destroy the Ori was unsuccessful.
am I supposed to take your word for that?
I've been personally supervising the construction of dozens of ships.
now that our intergalactic gate is operational again, there's nothing to stop them from coming here.
we should have the entire galaxy converted in a matter of months.
just because you've been building ships, doesn't prove anything.
what are you doing here?
where are your friends from Earth.
friends come and go.
have they abandoned you?
I'd rather not talk about it.
I really must know, mother.
you do realise, in a traditional, motherdaughter relationship,
I'm supposed to be the bossy one...
Oh, whatever.
it makes no difference now, anyway.
I've got it.
I've figured it out. - Got what?
the answer you were looking for, for the Clava Sorusy thingymajiggamy.
the Clava DeSora Infinatus?
right, that's the one. I know where it is.
the Clava DeSora Infinatus, literally, the key to infinite treasure, is the Ancient tablet Athena was seeking from Quetesh.
now it supposedly holds the clues to the whereabouts of a vast storehouse of Ancient weapons technol...
Yes! Daniel! This is very interesting. Get to the good part!
the good part? - I figured it out.
I know where the treasure is.
you solved the Clava DeSora Infinatus?
Yes, I most certainly did!
Daniel shared some of his findings with me last night, before I went to sleep and after a rather, well, nasty dream, in which I appeared on a television program, where it seemed you had to dance with supposedly well known personalities in front of a panel of judges...
a shape came into my mind.
the symbol for infinity. - Yes.
infinite treasure. Infinity. You see?
and it intersects with six symbols, which when combined, correspond with a gate address.
why would the Ancients use the Earth symbol for infinity, to hide their treasure?
actually, no-one knows the exact origin of the symbol itself.
it's been found on Tibetan rock carvings, dating back over a thousand years as well as a host of other places.
for all we know, it could well have originated with the Ancients.
you can rotate that symbol any which way you want.
Yes, but THIS is how it appeared in my dream,
and when we put these six symbols into the database, it came up with only one address.
why does this all sound familiar?
did Adria not send you information in dream form, to lure us to the planet where the Sangraal was hidden?
Yes, but no, this is different. I came up with this on my own.
OK, I suppose it IS possible that Quetesh knew its location and this is simply a latent memory being dredged up by Athena.
there you go.
do we have any idea what this Ancient storehouse actually contains?
no idea, sir, but it must be big if Athena was so eager to get her hands on it.
I feel very strongly about this, General.
what can it hurt to send a team?
I didn't send you that information.
that's what I tried to tell them, but they didn't believe me.
especially when the reconnaisance team returned.
what is it? - SG3 and 8, they're coming in hot.
open the iris.
they're right on our tail!
shut the gate! Shut it down!
shut it down! - Do it!
med teams to the gate room, immediately!
what happened?
it was an ambush, sir.
Ori soldiers made our position as soon as we stepped through the gate.
I lost two men. Couple more injured.
that's not possible. That can't be.
you tell that to the men who died.
Colonel!
debrief in my office. - Yes, sir.
I had the same dream again, only this time, the shape appeared vertically, rather than horizontally.
note, that AGAIN, it intercepts with six symbols and that AGAIN, the six symbols only match one address in our database.
what?
what's the problem? We need to investigate this?
Vala. - What?
do you not see what's going on here? - No.
this is Adria telling us where to go, so she can pick us off.
next, you'll have a dream where the symbol's on a slight angle and I bet it will still correspond to one single gate address.
she's using you, Vala. - No. I would know.
well, you didn't know before.
did you.
it just got worse from there - Daniel, what's happening? - It's not looking good.
most of the IOA delegates, think you've been compromised.
but I didn't do anything wrong. I was trying to help.
it doesn't matter what your intentions were.
if Adria can manipulate you like this, any time she wants to, then you become a security risk.
they're talking about removing you from the team.
what?
they're also not comfortable with the idea of letting you go, given everything you've learned about Earth's defences.
I don't understand.
they're talking about confinement, Vala.
at Area 51.
you don't believe me, either.
you can't lie to me, Mother. I can read the truth in your mind.
I'm just surprised.
so was I.
how did you convince them to let you go?
I didn't.
that's the funny thing.
I guess they thought a locked door could hold me.
or they never imagined I'd make it off the base.
what do you plan to do now?
well, I had just won myself a cargo ship when you dropped by and broke up the game, so...
is that really what you want?
a life alone. Always on the run?
that life no longer suits you, Mother. You belong with me.
return with me to my ship and take up your rightful place as Mother of the Orici!
Adria, stop it!
I am not your mother!
I may have given birth to you, but WE are not family!
so stop pretending.
you just need time to think about it.
we'll talk further, on our way.
where are we going?
to find the Clava DeSora Infinatus.
you think it's real?
I think Colonel Carter was right.
this might be knowledge from your time as a Goa'uld, being dredged up through your subconscious.
well you're too late.
despite the fact that they didn't trust me, they thought that they should check out the second gate address, anyway, just to be safe.
I overheard them planning the mission as I was leaving.
Yes, but there's something you're not telling me.
I don't know what you're talking about. - Don't play games with me, Mother!
if I have to force this information out of you, it will be quite unpleasant.
they were worried about an ambush, so they're taking a ship.
we can beat them if we travel by stargate.
let's go.
now!
Howdy!
you didn't really think we'd invite you to a party and not disable your funky powers, did you?
I have no idea what's going on.
don't worry, Vala, it's all part of the plan.
don't YOU ever speak to me, ever again!
lower your weapons!
buddy, I think you've got the wrong planet.
lower your weapons or we will all perish!
my master, Lord Baal, has target this location from orbit.
what are you doing?
carrying out my orders.
OK, that WASN'T part of the plan.
welcome!
don't waste your time.
I've learned a thing or two from our Tauri friends.
this room is being flooded with the same kind of E. M field they generate with that clever little device of theirs.
the one that prevents you from using your mind powers.
you should know that won't hold me forever.
of course not.
but that won't be a problem, after I'm done with you.
they got the jump on us. We had no time to react.
exactly how did Baal manage to pull this off?
I don't know, but they had detailed intelligence.
he was aware of both are locations and intentions.
bigger question is, what does Baal want with Adria?
perhaps he intends to negotiate for shared control of the galaxy.
she doesn't strike me as the sharing type.
either way, we do not want those two hanging out together.
exactly. We have to get her back.
we're on it, sir! - Wait!
how's Vala?
pissed.
somebody gonna fill her in? - Absolutely.
just not us.
this isn't right, you know.
I escaped fair and square.
you bringing me back here is tantamount to kidnapping!
listen, we know you're upset, but you have to understand, this was part of a plan.
upset?! Why would I possibly be upset?!
maybe because I was betrayed and abandoned by the only people in the entire galaxy,
I thought were my friends. Don't be silly!
we ARE your friends and we did not betray you.
you didn't exactly back me up now, did you?
what she means is, none of it actually happened!
what are you talking about?
this device is a slightly altered version of the memory implant technology, we received from a race called the Galarens.
we used it to create a fictional memory and implant it in your mind.
we knew you'd have trouble understanding all of this, so we took the liberty of making a recording before you underwent the procedure!
look.
tilt it up a bit.
alright.
thankyou, I can see.
we're rolling! - Oh, we're on.
why didn't you say so? - Gum.
Thanks.
Hello, gorgeous.
if you're watching this, you're obviously back at Stargate Command and you are probably thinking that everyone around you has gone completely...
wonko.
with the possible exception of Daniel, who, let's face it, was always a little bit...
vala! - Sorry.
um, seriously though substituting our memories was my idea.
brilliant, I know and incredibly brave!
but it was the only way for the plan to work.
so if you ARE watching this, you have obviously made it back...
and let me be the first to say, well done, and enjoy the substantial pay rise that's been promised to you if the mission succeeds.
Oh yeah, that's enough. - Thankyou.
we heard that Adria had returned through the supergate.
now, if the Ori are dead, we thought we might be able to convince her to leave quietly, with her army.
and she'd be able to tell if you were lying to her, so as far as you were concerned, it wasn't a lie.
I escaped using a Sodan Cloak.
you allowed me to be exposed to radiation, so that you could carry out your plan!
uh, YOUR plan...
and, no, that was also part of the false memory.
we escorted you to the planet where Adria found you and we dropped you off.
slept through it like a baby.
so...
no IOA?
no Reynold's men?
no television program about dancing with supposed celebrities?
actually, that part was real.
how very disturbing.
Yeah.
comfy? - You made a terrible mistake.
release me now and I will be merciful.
you're so much more pleasant, when you lack the ability to snap my neck with your thoughts.
you're a fool!
dealing with powers, way beyond your means!
when my army catches up with you... - Don't waste your breath!
your army has no idea where you are and it'll be days before they even question your disappearance.
even then, all their queries will lead them to the Tauri.
if you intend to kill me, you should know, the Ori will not halt their attacks on this galaxy.
I have no intention of killing you.
as a matter of fact, my whole plan hinges on you being very much alive.
so you can ransom me for your freedom.
far from it. You can offer me something far more valuable.
control... Of your army.
they'll never listen to you. - No!
but they Do listen to YOU.
there's nothing you can do to make me bend my army to your will.
well, I wouldn't be so sure about that.
agent Barrett has some information regarding Baal's whereabouts.
I got a call from one of my agents.
undercover inside Baal's operations, here on Earth.
apparently, the clones are planning to meet as a group.
where and when? - P3R-112. Today.
not a lot of notice. I just got the intel an hour ago.
how reliable is it?
my guy's embedded at the top. He wouldn't break cover, unless he was sure.
well we've been here before. We have a pretty good idea of the layout.
take a marine unit.
Yes, sir.
kind of quiet spot, for such a big meeting.
I think that's the idea.
I'm not seeing a lot of movement.
I think I know why.
looks like somebody got here before us.
no wounds, no sign of combat.
symbiote poison? - I believe so.
why would the Baals kill their own Jaffa?
I don't think the Jaffa were the intended target.
Ah, at last, the guest of honour.
you two are about to be getting VERY aquainted.
well, you gotta hand it to him. The man throws a mean dinner party.
well he knows we're coming after him and he's covering his tracks.
indeed.
stand back, I'm warning you!
just take it easy! - We're not gonna hurt you!
much.
I thought they were all dead.
apparently not.
xxxxxx
we got a lead.
once he woke up, our Jaffa friend was surprisingly forthcoming.
he confirmed the fact that Baal was behind the attempt to kill all his clones.
apparently, he had assembled them for what they thought was a meeting on the Adria situation.
instead, he beamed in canisters of symbiote poison.
quite the door prize.
Yeah! Whatever Baal's up to, he doesn't want any witnesses.
lucky for us, he didn't realise one of his Jaffa uses tretonin.
any idea where he is now?
actually, yes.
the Jaffa was able to provide us with the coordinates, where Baal's ship is located.
the Odyssey is standing by. You move out again in one hour.
assuming for the moment this Jaffa is telling the truth and we actually find Baal's ship, how do you propose we capture Adria?
same way he got her off the planet. We beam in, tag her and beam out.
it's a big ship, Colonel. How are you gonna find her?
well actually, it shouldn't be that difficult.
we're assuming Baal has some sort of technology, similar to our own Anti-Prior device, otherwise she would have used her powers the instant he beamed her onboard.
if we scan for those specific E. M frequencies, we should be able to pinpoint her location with a fair degree of accuracy.
all this pre-supposes that we get the drop on him and he doesn't raise the shields.
Yeah.
alright then. Good luck.
vala, you got a sec?
sure.
you're welcome to sit this one out.
Why?
I mean, why would I?
you know why we're bringing Adria back, right?
sure!
to tell her to take her army and clear off.
and if she resists?
we will take action.
by killing her.
you're ok with that?
of course.
alright.
Wow!
I take it we are cloaked?
pretty cool, huh? - Yeah.
Colonel, the result of your scan is here.
this room shows a pronounced level of the same E. M radiation, generated by the Anti-Prior device.
looks like you were right.
let's go get her.
that's it.
don't worry, this will all be over soon.
odyssey, we are good to go!
Hey!
wake up!
sorry.
it's not very comfortable, believe me,
I know from experience, but we're not taking any chances.
it's over, Adria.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
Adria's no longer available.
baal is in Adria?
Yes, sir. It's the bad guy equivalent of cordon bleu.
it actually makes sense from his perspective, sir.
not only has he taken on a more powerful host, but Adria is also in control of the Ori army.
so he convinces them to do his bidding and not hers.
well, when you think about it, their goals aren't all that different.
control of the galaxy. Worshipped by millions.
and if the Ori are dead, he'll never be called to the carpet by the boys upstairs.
what do we do now? - Kill them both.
hard to argue with that logic. It's a twofer.
well, there's not guarantee that her army would stop fighting, even if she WAS dead.
the only way to be certain, is for her to order them to stand down.
and how do we get her to do that?
well, if Baal's symbiote is supressing Adria's consciousness, we should be able to do the same thing.
swap Baal out for someone we can trust.
doesn't supressing the host, go against their fundamental beliefs?
well, I'm sure they'd make an exception in this case.
we've been trading intelligence with the Tokra, since the Ori first arrived.
they wanna get rid of them, just as much as we do.
get in touch. See if you can set it up.
in the meantime, keep a close eye on your guest.
so, have you decided what you intend to do with me?
well, we're still weighing our options.
Teal'c here, had a good idea.
I can imagine.
no, you cannot.
I must caution you against doing anything too rash.
in fact, your best course of action would be to release me.
I think we have a difference of opinion, there.
my whole plan was to order the Ori army back out of this galaxy.
you let me carry it out, we'll be rid of them forever.
that is our plan as well, only without YOUR participation.
what do you mean?
he means, we're gonna bring in someone a little more reliable.
see, right now, you're like a Pinto engine in a '71 Mustang.
we gotta swap you out for a big block Tokra.
it takes a great deal of effort to supress a consciousness this powerful.
the Tokra don't have the strength.
not to mention the fact that I'll kill Adria, the moment you try to remove me.
well that's great. We can live with that.
perhaps, but remember, I'm sharing Adria's mind.
you would lose all access to the knowledge I possess.
for example?
for one thing, I can confirm the Ori are dead...
and that's just the beginning.
with my knowledge and your...
pluckiness, we can accomplish a great deal.
remember how we worked together to locate the Sangraal?
as I recall, your efforts were not particularly helpful.
of course, it's your decision, but it seems you only have two options.
work with me to our mutual benefit or kill us both and miss out on everything I have to offer.
you're just in time. The Tokra contingent is about to arrive.
I am Juseen. I will be performing the surgery.
these are my assistants.
welcome on board the Odyssey. I'm Colonel Davidson.
I'm sure you know Colonel Carter, Doctor Jackson and Vala.
Yes.
I knew you as Quetesh.
things have changed a little since then.
news that the leader of the Ori army had been captured, came as a ray of hope to my people.
that being said, the extraction procedure that we are about to undertake, is extremely difficult.
even though we have refined the process, considerably, there remains a very real risk that Adria will not survive.
well, the only other option we have is to leave Baal in and trust he's telling the truth, so...
then we should begin immediately.
Zanuf, the symbiote we brought, cannot survive outside of a host, for long.
the infirmary's this way.
time to go.
what about our arrangement.
Oh, you mean the part where you string us along until you overcome the effects of the Anti-Prior device.
we'll pass.
sedative appears to be working. Heartrate and BP are holding steady.
there it is. Let's begin.
we will need to work quickly.
the symbiotes autonomic response can trigger complications, even under anesthetic.
initiating the first incision.
I need suction.
what's up?!
nothing!
just didn't feel like sticking around for the surgery.
you know, weak stomach and all that.
Hey!
you sure you're ok with this?
why does everyone keep asking me that?
because she's your daughter and no matter what she's done, it must be difficult to see her treated this way.
let's get something clear. She's not my daughter, Daniel.
the Ori impregnated me against my will and forced me to bring her into the galaxy.
I was an incubator. A shipping crate.
and nothing more.
I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that you don't feel something.
I do.
satisfaction at seeing their plan fail.
there!
I've severed the primary nerve conduit.
you see how the filaments are retracting?
now, moving onto the lateral.
what is it?
I was afraid this might happen.
Hey! What's up?!
trouble with the surgery.
what happened?
baal decided to be even more difficult than usual.
we were able to extract him, but not before he was able to release a deadly toxin into Adria's nervous system.
can't the Tokra symbiote heal her?
unfortunately, we were unable to complete the implantation.
the host body was simply too weak.
Adria is unconscious at the moment, but when she awakens, she will suffer greatly before she dies.
the one thing we can do for her, is an increased dosage of the toxin.
it will kill her instantly.
in the interest of patient care and for our own safety,
I recommend that we administrate immediately.
do it.
I'd like to be there.
crap!
you and your friends were trying to kill me, Mother.
I can't let that happen.
SG1, come in. What the hell's going on down there?
I'm getting reports that all sections around the infirmary are being sealed off.
it's Adria, sir. She's barricaded herself in.
is there any way you can beam us directly there?
negative!
she seems to be generating some kind of E. M interference.
we're gonna need a cutting torch down here, ASAP.
you got it.
there's an auxillary control console on this level.
if I can get to it, I might be able to override it.
go!
you can quit acting. You're obviously not sick.
Oh, this body really is dying.
I just wanna use what little time I have left as wisely as possible.
by doing what? Destroying me and my friends?
don't be silly, Mother.
if I wanted to kill you, I could have done it a long time ago.
no. I need time to prepare.
prepare for what?
ascension.
vala! - Don't!
vala, can you hear me?!
guys, it's Daniel. I can't reach Vala.
Daniel What is your location?
just outside the infirmary. Adria's locked them in.
we are blocked as well.
Colonel Mitchell is attempting to cut through one of the doors.
well you'd better hurry up. I think I figured out what she's trying to do.
Adria's trying to ascend.
Adria, you don't have to do this.
granted, this wasn't part of my plan, but I can still accomplish a great deal.
perhaps even more.
more what? More deaths? More enslavement?
don't attempt to play on my compassion, Mother.
as you said, I'm not your daughter, I'm an Ori.
part Ori, part Human.
that will soon change.
xxxxxxxx
Carter, how's that override coming?
it's not. I mean, it wouldn't do any good.
what the hell does that mean?
she's not actually in control of the system.
I think she's just holding the doors shut with her mind.
cutting torch would take too long.
what is it? - Your friends are very determined.
uh, Daniel, I'm showing a coolant leak in the hallway you're in right now.
got that, thanks. It's Adria! She's trying to distract us!
well it's a hell of a distraction. That stuff's toxic.
you need to get out of there, right now.
Yeah, that's gonna be a problem!
can you shut it down?
I'll have to reroute coolant out of the entire section. I'm on it.
vala, if you can hear me, I really need you to open the door!
Adria, stop this, please!
that's it.
I always wondered if you had it in you to kill me...
goodbye, Mother.
nice work.
wasn't us. Adria let go.
Jackson! - I'm ok.
Where's Adria?
she's gone.
and once Adria realised she couldn't save herself, she had no choice, but to ascend.
what do you suppose this means for us?
to be honest, I'm not sure.
if the Ori are still out there, then presumably, she's joined the fight.
but if Baal is telling the truth and the Ori are dead, then she just assumed all the power they once had.
either way, we could see some incarnation of her again, down the road.
holding a SERIOUS grudge.
at least we may take comfort in the knowledge that Baal is dead.
wouldn't put a deposit down on that just yet.
when we were breaking Adria out of Baal's ship,
I ran across another clone guarding her.
killed him, but where there is one...
there may be more.
we captured and killed Adria and Baal on the same day.
are you telling me this is all a wash?
No!
we dealt the Ori movement a serious blow, today.
and we rid ourselves of Adria for the time being.
that is DEFINITELY a step ahead.
all you have to do is prick him, once.
the effect will be immediate.
he'll believe you to be his loyal slave jarren.
Whoa! No violence.
your name?
bounty hunter.
don't worry about sg-1 and earth.
they are of little consequence.
approaching the coordinates now, sir.
drop us out of hyperspace. Maximum shields.
Colonel?
we should have a visual.
if the second supergate is here, we should be able to see it.
anything, on the sensors?
there seems to be a powerful gravitational field nearby.
Supergates use black holes for power.
Oh, this is not a black hole.
it's a neutron star, and the field is powerful enough to weaken our shields and cause
damage report!
reporting hull damage on decks 2 and 7.
battle stations!
get us out of here, major.
hyperdrive will not engage.
hull integrity has been compromised!
who the hell is shooting at us?
I can't tell, sir.
detecting three ships.
Ori?
based on size,
I'd say goa'uld motherships.
their shields should be weakened as well!
fire all forward rail guns. Arm missiles.
major, transfer auxiliary power to sublight engines and set a course, hard right.
sir, detecting multiple small objects dead ahead.
Oh, god.
it's a minefield.
full reverse thrust!
damage report!
emergency subspace communication from the odyssey, sir.
put it onscreen.
stargate command, this is colonel paul emerson of the odyssey, authentication code delta-six-alpha-five.
we're under attack. We've suffered extreme damage.
intel about the second supergate was false.
we've been ambushed by as many as three goa'uld motherships.
we've lost hyperdrive, shields are down.
several decks without life support.
we're being boarded!
that's it, sir. That's all we got.
we began receiving telemetry from the emergency transponder approximately 30 minutes after the distress call came in.
unfortunately, it doesn't tell us anything about the condition of the ship or the crew.
sounds like it was badly damaged.
anything on who might have been behind this?
we were acting on what we thought was reliable intel from the jaffa.
Bra'tac is investigating the source of the false intel, but the jaffa nation is in disarray, and many have reverted back to old warring factions.
tracing such betrayal may prove virtually impossible.
there must be a lot of jaffa out there who are pretty angry about the destruction of dakara.
the ori were responsible for that.
there are morethan a few who think it was us who led them there.
angry enough to set up an ambush? For what, revenge?
well, we have a signal. Let's go check it out.
Yeah, one tiny snag there.
we have no vessels in which to travel.
the daedalus is on its way to pegasus.
and it will be days before a jaffa ship becomes available to us.
well, you only have to ask.
you must know by now that I can get you pretty much anything you want.
Yeah, for a price.
nothing comes for free, daniel.
of course, in this instance,
I would naturally waive my fee, but I will need some front money, so to speak.
be careful.
we still have no idea who's behind this.
glad to see you're awake, colonel.
how's your head?
it's fine, sir.
what's our status?
they towed us out of the minefield.
most of the crew is accounted for.
we're still missing three.
which one of you is colonel samantha carter?
I'm colonel paul emerson, commander of this ship.
if you have any questions, you ask me
if any of you try to be heroes, I assure you my commander will think nothing of venting this hold of all atmosphere.
I will not ask again.
I'm carter.
bring her.
him too.
Colonel carter...
I had heard you were quite attractive.
I'm colonel paul emerson, commander, of this ship.
what do you want?
nothing you can do for me.
now, colonel carter, on the other hand...
can I call you samantha?
no.
you're lucian alliance.
the uniform.
pathetic, isn't it?
pretending to be something we're not.
Anateo is my name, and believe me,
I am part of no alliance of any kind.
now, we don't know much about this ship yet, but we have found a subspace beacon that is giving away our position.
I need you to shut it off.
I'm not going to help you.
I don't see what choice you have.
you are going to do whatever it is I want you to do.
don't do it, sam.
Oh, I suggest you should do it...
it's not designed to be shut off.
it activates automatically and stays on.
then remove it.
don't help them, colonel.
that's an order.
I believe that now makes you the ranking officer on this ship, colonel carter.
I suggest you get to work, unless there's something else you'd rather do.
Yeah, she's a real beauty.
stabilizers are a bit wonky,
I'm afraid. Makes for a bumpy ride, but it's all perfectly safe.
Really?
not exactly.
we gave you as much raw naquadah as you needed and all you came up with was this piece of junk?
people's lives are at stake, daniel.
do you honestly think that I cheaped out on the ship and pocketed the difference?
what's that?
life support seems to be failing.
can you take over?
great, you fixed that. How about fixing the stabilizers?
I didn't fix anything.
I just disabled that annoying alarm.
our long-range sensors indicate that the signal coming from the odyssey transponder is changing location.
it's moving?
it appears to be traveling at sublight speed.
altering course to intercept.
are you cloaking?
I am attempting to.
it does not appear the cloak is responding.
the signal now appears to be originating from that planet.
sensors are picking up numerous lifesigns.
if life support were compromised they could have landed the ship for repairs.
they are not responding to our hails.
there appears to be a small civilization on the surface.
I knew I recognized this planet.
more friends of yours?
the goa'uld used to have a ship-building facility here.
it's now been taken over by the former human slaves.
from what I know, they have ties with the lucian alliance.
you know, that doesn't sound too good.
are we talking chop-shop here?
I have a contact here.
he might get skittish if we all show up, so it could be a good idea for me to go in alone.
you know, it could be a trap.
all the more reason why we shouldn't all go.
trust me, if he knows anything,
I'll be able to get it out of him, but the key is to be as inconspicuous and as non-threatening as possible.
if you like, I can take daniel.
Colonel... what happened?
you've been gone for hours.
Where's colonel emerson?
Vala mal doran...
I never thought you'd show your face in these parts again.
Borzin, you slimy, two-faced grease peddler.
come on, give us a hug.
and what poor loser have you conned into your company this time?
Oh, this is my apprentice, shamus.
you must be learning a great deal.
more than I'd like to.
actually, I only took him on as part of a bet. He's mentally disabled.
don't trust her. She will sell you out for a bad lunch the first chance she gets.
I know.
he likes me.
isn't that cute?
what do you want, vala, if you haven't already stolen it from me?
we're looking for some information.
about a tau'ri ship that was attacked not far from here.
any information you can give us...
okay, my friend...
here's the thing.
he's not my apprentice.
he's a mark.
No! -A very rich, very gullible one. Who's eating right out of my hands.
give us something, anything, and he'll make it very much worth your while.
you know, I've heard that before
all right, try this.
we traced the signal from the ship's emergency transponder here.
I know you can't possibly have the whole ship, but I know you must have some parts.
Borzin, I don't know what's going on, but you're in way over your head.
I've recently made some contacts high up in the lucian alliance that'd be very interested in knowing exactly how much you've been skimming off this operation.
offers that can't be refused.
over here.
while we're at it, why not get him to throw in some parts for our cargo ship?
one thing at a time.
is this what you're looking for?
that's odyssey's data recorder.
the transponder's still broadcasting.
where did you get this?
a man brought it a few hours ago.
he said it could fetch me a very nice price.
Anateo is my name, and believe me,
I am part of no alliance of any kind.
it's not designed to be shut off.
it activates automatically and stays on.
then remove it.
don't help them, colonel. That's an order.
you want more, show me the naquadah.
you know, that thing's useless to me unless I know who gave it to you.
Ooh, timing's everything. Him.
Jackson, report.
you want more, show me the naquadah.
you know, that thing's useless to me unless I know who gave it to you.
Ooh, timing's everything. Him.
we suspected it could be another ambush.
you think they were specifically after you?
they knew we would follow the transponder signal.
Why?
perhaps they were trying to deter us from trying to find the odyssey.
personally, I think they just don't like us.
well, I can see why they might not be your biggest fans.
well, whatever the reason, there was no other way to retrieve this intel.
the recording suggests the odyssey wasn't destroyed but is in the hands of the lucian alliance.
unfortunately, that's all we got.
Borzin disappeared along with daniel and vala, and no one else we talked to knew anything.
Teal'c, spread the word among the jaffa.
tell whoever will listen
I want to talk to the leader of the lucian alliance.
I've always felt civilization can be judged by two things
its food...
and its women.
I'd say yours is only halfway there.
I don't blame you, but you have to keep up your strength.
you have a whole ship to fix.
you know, that could ake the rest of my life.
whether that is long or painfully short is up to you.
Hi, sam!
we thought you'd miss us.
where are the others?
listen, there is that small matter of my fee.
Oh, of course.
half payment for half of sg-1.
two-fifths, actually.
it's a small quibble, but-- don't help.
look, it is not my fault that only two of them showed up.
of course.
take care of him.
look, I,uh... I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be seeing you again.
no, I think not.
put them in the hold.
don't worry, sam. It's all part of the plan.
each division of lucian alliance territory is controlled by one of netan's lieutenants, or "seconds,
as they're called. There are about 20 such individuals overseeing operations including smuggling, extortion, racketeering, and of course, trafficking in kassa.
is there anything new coming?
because this feels like a rerun to me.
well, we've been following up on rumors of betrayal and possible mutiny among the seconds.
there seems to be mounting dissent over netan's leadership.
well, that's good, but how does it help us?
and trusted seconds. He oversees a large kassa production operation on a remote group of planets on the outskirts of the galaxy.
what about him?
besides the fact that he's a brutal killer with a notorious temper
we've only know of him by reputation, sir.
he's extremely reclusive, and rarely, if ever, leaves his command ship.
very few, if any, of netan's inner circle have ever met the guy.
you think this kefflin is behind the disappearance of the odyssey?
no, sir.
I think he's the perfect candidate to impersonate.
excuse me?
I am suggesting that I infiltrate the lucian alliance.
it's the only way we're going to get reliable information on the odyssey.
you don't even have a decent picture of the man.
that's what makes him the perfect candidate, sir.
Dr. Jackson used it a few years back to infiltrate a system lord summit.
one jab of that, and netan will believe I am who I say I am regardless of what I look like.
no one else will question me because no one else has ever seen him.
so you think.
I'm not saying it isn't risky, sir.
I'm saying we have to do something.
how are you holding up?
I'm working as slowly as I can, but I can't keep it up forever.
any idea what they plan on doing with the ship?
or us? -No, but without the transponder, stargate command doesn't have a hope of finding us.
our only chance is to take the ship back.
well, I have an idea about that, but it's pretty risky.
well, it's probably better than our plan.
well, what's your plan?
we don't have one.
they have detected us, colonel mitchell.
are you prepared?
prepared as I'll ever be.
state your business.
I'm kefflin.
I'm here to see netan.
you are not expected.
I don't have to be expected.
authorize me for immediate transport, or I'll have your head as an ornament for my ship.
I will notify netan of your arrival.
where is netan?
I will take you to him.
fine. Let's go.
first, you must submit to a search.
I don't think so.
I asked not to be disturbed.
I apologize, netan, but there has been an incident.
I tried to tell them who I was, but apparently, the name kefflin didn't seem to mean much around here.
sorry about that.
the ring was a gift from my latest...conquest.
my dear friend kefflin is here, and you didn't inform me?
I'm sorry, master.
you asked not to be disturbed.
so you beat him instead.
as you can see, the beating wasn't...
entirely one way.
I'm sure it wasn't.
leave us.
what?
it is not too late to turn this ship over to netan.
you would be a hero.
you know I can't do that.
netan has failed the alliance, and his position as leader hangs precariously by a thread.
he knows I am his mostworthy challenger, but he could not very well just murder me in cold blood, so he sent us on a fool's quest.
but we succeeded.
Yes, and this is going to ensure the downfall of netan.
but why was it necessary to also bait a trap to capture sg-1?
because everyone knows that they have caused us more grief than any other adversary, including the ori.
all the seconds, including me, have begged netan to go after them, but he refused. He's a coward, choosing to run and hide rather than face the wrath of the tau'ri.
will we not?
we have brought their battleship to its knees.
what are they going to do?
after I present odyssey and sg-1 to the others, netan's stuffed corpse will be a trophy on my wall and control of the lucian alliance will be mine.
it's been a disappointing season, my friend.
drought and floods have ravaged our highest-yielding kassa plantations.
the armies of the ori continue to usurp the planets upon which we've established trade, and of course there's the tau'ri...
Yes.
committing our ships to co-operate in the fight gainst the ori incursion was a strategic mistake.
you've always appreciated my honesty in the past.
I have.
you're the boss.
I don't blame you, but others do.
I know.
is that why you're here?
the kefflin I know would never make such a trip without a serious purpose.
actually, it's the odyssey.
the tau'ri vessel.
word reached me you just captured it.
I wanted to know your plans.
its beaming and hyperspace technology could be a great advantage in transporting my crops.
where did you hear this? - The usual channels.
I heard rumor that the odyssey was destroyed in battle with the ori.
nothing has been confirmed yet.
I certainly had nothing to do with it.
a ship has been detected in proximity.
we are moving to intercept.
I'm beginning to think you enjoy being my prisoner.
sorry.
I accidentally overloaded a power coupling.
where is the rest of your team?
that man knows nothing of torture.
I'll find what we need.
I was wondering how long you'd be able to resist.
if you don't mind, I'm going to need some time alone with him.
all right, we have to find a way to get you out of here.
have you found the location of odyssey?
not yet, and I don't think netan knows where it is either, and he's definitely having some trouble with his seconds.
then you must maintain this ruse...
no, teal'c... not at your expense, no.
there are other lives at stake, mitchell.
fine.
just remember, I am an expert torturer.
something's going on in the hold.
go do a head count.
Vashin, make room.
this is kefflin.
I thought you did not like to show your face.
I'm seeing a therapist.
this is gavos. Slaviash.
what did you learn from the jaffa?
apparently, the rumors are true. The odyssey's still out there...
in the hands of anateo.
the tau'ri are in possession of an audio recording which indicates that he's in control of it.
I ordered the attack on the odyssey.
it is time the tau'ri were sent a message.
where is the ship?
I don't know.
Anateo has betrayed us. - Are you saying he succeeded...
in capturing the ship?
he hasn't reported in yet.
the tau'ri vessel is most powerful.
you could not have possibly expected him to survive.
I gave him a strategy that vastly improved his odds.
he came to me several months ago, demanding more territory...
as his planets had been overrun by the armies of the ori.
he suggested that he eliminate you, karug, take over your planets.
Anateo hasn't just captured the odyssey.
he's using it to bait a trap for sg-1.
he has lost his mind.
the tau'ri will declare all-out war on us.
you should have consulted with us, netan.
I need not consult with anyone!
now, is there anyone else who wants to challenge me?
Anateo betrayed us all, and he will pay, and as for the tau'ri, they were already at war with us and us with them, and I will not cower in fear.
so spread the word.
send all available ships.
I want the odyssey found.
now!
was it really necessary to embarrass me like that?
there have been whispers lately concerning the strength of your leadership.
I suspect...
those whispers will now stop.
for the time being.
you'll need someone to supervise gavos' territory.
your cut will be 20%.
come on!
I'm working as fast as I can... - you stole the prometheus all by yourself...
I know. The systems are all new.
you said you could do it. We do not exactly have a lot of time.
no. Sam warned us that a number of the arrays have been damaged.
even with locators, beaming a person from one room to another within the ship is very risky.
do you want them to rematerialize between the decks?
Teresh, this is anateo.
you missed your check-in. - Report.
move!
where are they?
Dr. Jackson and vala!
Anateo... we've got a problem.
Dr. Jackson, vala...
just wanted to let you know that your duplicity has already forfeited colonel carter's life.
unless you surrender immediately, the rest of the crew is next.
I can't be sure.
do it anyway.
no one else is going to fix this ship.
I think it's pretty clear that you've just been stalling, and that you're not really going to fix it for me anyway.
I'm just going to have to figure it out for myself.
good enough.
where is she?
well, I couldn't be sure, so I just beamed out the only other lifesign in the room instead.
okay, where is he?
well, sam did say it was risky.
when she's right, she's right.
only 50% of the shield emitters are responding.
okay, we need to get them back online and get the hull integrity back within acceptable parameters.
hyperdrive is our priority.
well, we think most of anateo's men have been accounted for.
most?
Yeah, we swept the ship twice, rounded up 14 men in total, but not solek.
Vala had to beam him out of the hold where the crew was being held, so we have no way of knowing for sure where he ended up.
did you check the sewage reservoir?
Yeah, no lifesigns.
how's it going here?
well, no shields, no weapons, no communications, and at least a day out for hyperdrive.
so we're sitting ducks.
kefflin, what are you doing?
interrogating the prisoner further.
and what have you learned?
not much yet.
fine.
then we can kill him together.
kill him?
we've learned all we can.
Anateo has left us no choice.
I am committed to sending a message to the tau'ri.
netan, I have to admit...
I was just beginning to enjoy this one.
I'm sorry my old friend.
your fun is over.
the odyssey has been found.
tenat, welcome.
this is my good friend kefflin.
it is my pleasure.
I have heard a great deal about you... kefflin.
Yeah, likewise.
tell me what you have learned, tenat, and perhaps I will spare your pathetic life.
funny as always, netan.
as you suspected, the odyssey was never destroyed.
Anateo betrayed you and kept it for himself.
where is it?
half a day's journey, maybe less.
I have transmitted the coordinates to your bridge.
get to your ship. We'll travel together.
of course.
wait just a moment...
look, I don't know who you think I am...
you are cam mitchell, bounty hunter.
you double-crossed me and my partner jup.
what do you want?
I do not know how you've managed to convince netan that you are kefflin, but you are obviously up to something big here.
I will take half.
and what about your loyalty to netan?
he would kill me the instant I am no longer of use to him.
and jup, your old partner, where's he?
he is working elsewhere at the moment.
we need not worry about cutting him in.
fine, 10%.
it'll be big, trust me.
30%, or I tell netan you are not who you say you are.
25%, no more.
I'll ring over to your ship before this one jumps to hyperspace and fill you in on the details.
unchain the prisoner. He's coming with me.
I have grown weary of this torture, colonel mitchell.
that's pretty obvious, but right now...
we got to go.
you remember tenat?
Yeah, as in jup and tenat.
well, he somehow weaseled his way into commanding an alliance mothership, and check this out... the incompetent twit actually found the odyssey.
did he see you?
Yeah, recognized me as well, but he's keeping his mouth shut, because he figures I'm scamming netan and he wants a piece of the action.
we have to get over to his ship before this one jumps to hyperspace.
what is your plan?
I'm making it up as I go along.
netan is here to see you.
what?
I know of your intention to deceive me. - Well, how did you...
I knew colonel mitchell was impersonating kefflin all along.
Colonel mitchell?
of sg-1.
I caught him and teal'c trying to leave my ship.
no, netan, you are mistaken.
it's true.
I knew he wasn't kefflin.
but I was merely trying to lure him here so I could turn him over to you.
that is the stupidest thing I have ever heard!
please... don't kill me.
get up, you pathetic excuse for A...
whatever you are.
what are you going to do to me?
nothing for the moment.
Oh, thank you.
you are a generous and gracious man.
I say that all the time, don't I, men?
tell him how honored you are to finally meet him in person...
shut up. Stop sniveling.
Dr. Jackson...
if these sensors are working properly, two goa'uld motherships just emerged from hyperspace and are closing in.
Sam? - Go ahead.
we may need that hyperdrive a little ahead of schedule.
how ahead of schedule?
about 10 seconds would be good. We've got company.
we need more time. Can you stall?
we're about to find out.
what's our shield status? - Less than 30%.
weapons?
rail guns are online, but we don't have missiles yet.
one of the ships is hailing us.
on screen.
Dr. Jackson... - oh, right.
Hi. Hi. How are you?
I was expecting anateo.
Yes, he was here for a while, but then he... had to go.
your ship is battered.
my scans tell me your shield strength is low, and if you had hyperdrive, you would have left long ago.
surrender now or be destroyed.
right... okey-dokey.
we surrender.
prepare to be boarded.
Yeah, see, that's where you're going to run into a bit of a problem.
you see, our rings are damaged, and as you yourself pointed out, our shields are down, which means atmosphere in the 302 bays is unsustainable.
I- I mean, I just don't see how we're going to get your guys over here unless you want me to try...beaming you over?
they're powering weapons.
Sam, I think I've stalled as long as I can.
we need more time. - Too late.
you should probably prepare to return fire.
for the record...
I'm always prepared.
I just have to press this button here.
right. I just... I thought that's what you're supposed to say, so I...
I know.
open fire on the other hatak vessel.
what? - You heard me.
but... you dare question my tactics?
there's a ship full of traitors out there waiting to unseat me as leader of the lucian alliance.
fire now!
you shall be richly rewarded with vast territories to command.
fire on the other hatak vessel.
one of the motherships is firing at the other.
receiving radio signal.
odyssey, this is teal'c. Do you copy?
it is good to hear your voice.
Colonel mitchell and i are onboard one of the motherships.
request that you beam us aboard the odyssey immediately.
Yeah.
locking on their locator beacons.
what are you doing?
what?
how?
I thought this was netan.
what are you doing sitting there?
what are you wearing?
Oh, it's A... long story.
you are the biggest fool in two galaxies!
but netan... I...
I screwed up.
it's the wrong one. You can't just jam it in.
how did you do that?
honestly? I don't know. That almost never normally works.
Daniel, try it now.
shield failure is imminent.
damn you, cam mitchell.
you know, you're very lucky that no one else on the bridge of that ship knew what netan looked like.
Yeah, it was a gamble but I figured if I got made, or if the chemical jab on tenat didn't work after half an hour,
I'd take the bridge by force.
I had a pissed off jaffa waiting to help me out.
Where's teal'c?
Ah, he's in the infirmary.
Yeah, big boy got banged up a bit.
Hey, what happened?
how did you get the lucian alliance to fire on each other?
Oh, you'll love this...
before you tell us
I got long range-communications back online and sent a message to earth telling them that we'll be coming home.
Yeah.
you should probably add that we have officially declared war on the lucian alliance.
what exactly do you want from me?
the code to an Ancient tablet, that I helped Quetesh locate, long ago.
I take it the anti-Prior device is working?
well, he didn't stop us from zatting him.
what the hell's going on?
I had to be sure this was working on her, first.
we gotta go!
you're bluffing.
you have nothing.
I tell you what.
I'll bet you everything I have on this table, against that cargo ship of yours, outside.
your winnings wouldn't cover the value of that ship.
what if I throw in this?
and what's that supposed to be?
you've got your wager. As foolish as it may be.
I guess it's just my lucky day.
I thought this was an HONEST establishment.
it is.
and that's why it's necessary to have you searched.
I don't suppose we could call this even?
Hello, mother.
it's good to see you. It's been far too long.
I... did not expect...
to see you again.
I had to return, mother.
my work here is unfinished.
who is this?
you REALLY don't wanna know.
get out, all of you!
I don't suppose you're gonna let me just walk out of here.
I'm afraid not.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, mother, but your attempt to destroy the Ori was unsuccessful.
am I supposed to take your word for that?
I've been personally supervising the construction of dozens of ships.
now that our intergalactic gate is operational again, there's nothing to stop them from coming here.
we should have the entire galaxy converted in a matter of months.
just because you've been building ships, doesn't prove anything.
what are you doing here?
where are your friends from Earth.
friends come and go.
have they abandoned you?
I'd rather not talk about it.
I really must know, mother.
you do realise, in a traditional, motherdaughter relationship,
I'm supposed to be the bossy one...
Oh, whatever.
it makes no difference now, anyway.
I've got it.
I've figured it out. - Got what?
the answer you were looking for, for the Clava Sorusy thingymajiggamy.
the Clava DeSora Infinatus?
right, that's the one. I know where it is.
the Clava DeSora Infinatus, literally, the key to infinite treasure, is the Ancient tablet Athena was seeking from Quetesh.
now it supposedly holds the clues to the whereabouts of a vast storehouse of Ancient weapons technol...
Yes! Daniel! This is very interesting. Get to the good part!
the good part? - I figured it out.
I know where the treasure is.
you solved the Clava DeSora Infinatus?
Yes, I most certainly did!
Daniel shared some of his findings with me last night, before I went to sleep and after a rather, well, nasty dream, in which I appeared on a television program, where it seemed you had to dance with supposedly well known personalities in front of a panel of judges...
a shape came into my mind.
the symbol for infinity. - Yes.
infinite treasure. Infinity. You see?
and it intersects with six symbols, which when combined, correspond with a gate address.
why would the Ancients use the Earth symbol for infinity, to hide their treasure?
actually, no-one knows the exact origin of the symbol itself.
it's been found on Tibetan rock carvings, dating back over a thousand years as well as a host of other places.
for all we know, it could well have originated with the Ancients.
you can rotate that symbol any which way you want.
Yes, but THIS is how it appeared in my dream,
and when we put these six symbols into the database, it came up with only one address.
why does this all sound familiar?
did Adria not send you information in dream form, to lure us to the planet where the Sangraal was hidden?
Yes, but no, this is different. I came up with this on my own.
OK, I suppose it IS possible that Quetesh knew its location and this is simply a latent memory being dredged up by Athena.
there you go.
do we have any idea what this Ancient storehouse actually contains?
no idea, sir, but it must be big if Athena was so eager to get her hands on it.
I feel very strongly about this, General.
what can it hurt to send a team?
I didn't send you that information.
that's what I tried to tell them, but they didn't believe me.
especially when the reconnaisance team returned.
what is it? - SG3 and 8, they're coming in hot.
open the iris.
they're right on our tail!
shut the gate! Shut it down!
shut it down! - Do it!
med teams to the gate room, immediately!
what happened?
it was an ambush, sir.
Ori soldiers made our position as soon as we stepped through the gate.
I lost two men. Couple more injured.
that's not possible. That can't be.
you tell that to the men who died.
Colonel!
debrief in my office. - Yes, sir.
I had the same dream again, only this time, the shape appeared vertically, rather than horizontally.
note, that AGAIN, it intercepts with six symbols and that AGAIN, the six symbols only match one address in our database.
what?
what's the problem? We need to investigate this?
Vala. - What?
do you not see what's going on here? - No.
this is Adria telling us where to go, so she can pick us off.
next, you'll have a dream where the symbol's on a slight angle and I bet it will still correspond to one single gate address.
she's using you, Vala. - No. I would know.
well, you didn't know before.
did you.
it just got worse from there - Daniel, what's happening? - It's not looking good.
most of the IOA delegates, think you've been compromised.
but I didn't do anything wrong. I was trying to help.
it doesn't matter what your intentions were.
if Adria can manipulate you like this, any time she wants to, then you become a security risk.
they're talking about removing you from the team.
what?
they're also not comfortable with the idea of letting you go, given everything you've learned about Earth's defences.
I don't understand.
they're talking about confinement, Vala.
at Area 51.
you don't believe me, either.
you can't lie to me, Mother. I can read the truth in your mind.
I'm just surprised.
so was I.
how did you convince them to let you go?
I didn't.
that's the funny thing.
I guess they thought a locked door could hold me.
or they never imagined I'd make it off the base.
what do you plan to do now?
well, I had just won myself a cargo ship when you dropped by and broke up the game, so...
is that really what you want?
a life alone. Always on the run?
that life no longer suits you, Mother. You belong with me.
return with me to my ship and take up your rightful place as Mother of the Orici!
Adria, stop it!
I am not your mother!
I may have given birth to you, but WE are not family!
so stop pretending.
you just need time to think about it.
we'll talk further, on our way.
where are we going?
to find the Clava DeSora Infinatus.
you think it's real?
I think Colonel Carter was right.
this might be knowledge from your time as a Goa'uld, being dredged up through your subconscious.
well you're too late.
despite the fact that they didn't trust me, they thought that they should check out the second gate address, anyway, just to be safe.
I overheard them planning the mission as I was leaving.
Yes, but there's something you're not telling me.
I don't know what you're talking about. - Don't play games with me, Mother!
if I have to force this information out of you, it will be quite unpleasant.
they were worried about an ambush, so they're taking a ship.
we can beat them if we travel by stargate.
let's go.
now!
Howdy!
you didn't really think we'd invite you to a party and not disable your funky powers, did you?
I have no idea what's going on.
don't worry, Vala, it's all part of the plan.
don't YOU ever speak to me, ever again!
lower your weapons!
buddy, I think you've got the wrong planet.
lower your weapons or we will all perish!
my master, Lord Baal, has target this location from orbit.
what are you doing?
carrying out my orders.
OK, that WASN'T part of the plan.
welcome!
don't waste your time.
I've learned a thing or two from our Tauri friends.
this room is being flooded with the same kind of E. M field they generate with that clever little device of theirs.
the one that prevents you from using your mind powers.
you should know that won't hold me forever.
of course not.
but that won't be a problem, after I'm done with you.
they got the jump on us. We had no time to react.
exactly how did Baal manage to pull this off?
I don't know, but they had detailed intelligence.
he was aware of both are locations and intentions.
bigger question is, what does Baal want with Adria?
perhaps he intends to negotiate for shared control of the galaxy.
she doesn't strike me as the sharing type.
either way, we do not want those two hanging out together.
exactly. We have to get her back.
we're on it, sir! - Wait!
how's Vala?
pissed.
somebody gonna fill her in? - Absolutely.
just not us.
this isn't right, you know.
I escaped fair and square.
you bringing me back here is tantamount to kidnapping!
listen, we know you're upset, but you have to understand, this was part of a plan.
upset?! Why would I possibly be upset?!
maybe because I was betrayed and abandoned by the only people in the entire galaxy,
I thought were my friends. Don't be silly!
we ARE your friends and we did not betray you.
you didn't exactly back me up now, did you?
what she means is, none of it actually happened!
what are you talking about?
this device is a slightly altered version of the memory implant technology, we received from a race called the Galarens.
we used it to create a fictional memory and implant it in your mind.
we knew you'd have trouble understanding all of this, so we took the liberty of making a recording before you underwent the procedure!
look.
tilt it up a bit.
alright.
thankyou, I can see.
we're rolling! - Oh, we're on.
why didn't you say so? - Gum.
Thanks.
Hello, gorgeous.
if you're watching this, you're obviously back at Stargate Command and you are probably thinking that everyone around you has gone completely...
wonko.
with the possible exception of Daniel, who, let's face it, was always a little bit...
vala! - Sorry.
um, seriously though substituting our memories was my idea.
brilliant, I know and incredibly brave!
but it was the only way for the plan to work.
so if you ARE watching this, you have obviously made it back...
and let me be the first to say, well done, and enjoy the substantial pay rise that's been promised to you if the mission succeeds.
Oh yeah, that's enough. - Thankyou.
we heard that Adria had returned through the supergate.
now, if the Ori are dead, we thought we might be able to convince her to leave quietly, with her army.
and she'd be able to tell if you were lying to her, so as far as you were concerned, it wasn't a lie.
I escaped using a Sodan Cloak.
you allowed me to be exposed to radiation, so that you could carry out your plan!
uh, YOUR plan...
and, no, that was also part of the false memory.
we escorted you to the planet where Adria found you and we dropped you off.
slept through it like a baby.
so...
no IOA?
no Reynold's men?
no television program about dancing with supposed celebrities?
actually, that part was real.
how very disturbing.
Yeah.
comfy? - You made a terrible mistake.
release me now and I will be merciful.
you're so much more pleasant, when you lack the ability to snap my neck with your thoughts.
you're a fool!
dealing with powers, way beyond your means!
when my army catches up with you... - Don't waste your breath!
your army has no idea where you are and it'll be days before they even question your disappearance.
even then, all their queries will lead them to the Tauri.
if you intend to kill me, you should know, the Ori will not halt their attacks on this galaxy.
I have no intention of killing you.
as a matter of fact, my whole plan hinges on you being very much alive.
so you can ransom me for your freedom.
far from it. You can offer me something far more valuable.
control... Of your army.
they'll never listen to you. - No!
but they Do listen to YOU.
there's nothing you can do to make me bend my army to your will.
well, I wouldn't be so sure about that.
agent Barrett has some information regarding Baal's whereabouts.
I got a call from one of my agents.
undercover inside Baal's operations, here on Earth.
apparently, the clones are planning to meet as a group.
where and when? - P3R-112. Today.
not a lot of notice. I just got the intel an hour ago.
how reliable is it?
my guy's embedded at the top. He wouldn't break cover, unless he was sure.
well we've been here before. We have a pretty good idea of the layout.
take a marine unit.
Yes, sir.
kind of quiet spot, for such a big meeting.
I think that's the idea.
I'm not seeing a lot of movement.
I think I know why.
looks like somebody got here before us.
no wounds, no sign of combat.
symbiote poison? - I believe so.
why would the Baals kill their own Jaffa?
I don't think the Jaffa were the intended target.
Ah, at last, the guest of honour.
you two are about to be getting VERY aquainted.
well, you gotta hand it to him. The man throws a mean dinner party.
well he knows we're coming after him and he's covering his tracks.
indeed.
stand back, I'm warning you!
just take it easy! - We're not gonna hurt you!
much.
I thought they were all dead.
apparently not.
xxxxxx
we got a lead.
once he woke up, our Jaffa friend was surprisingly forthcoming.
he confirmed the fact that Baal was behind the attempt to kill all his clones.
apparently, he had assembled them for what they thought was a meeting on the Adria situation.
instead, he beamed in canisters of symbiote poison.
quite the door prize.
Yeah! Whatever Baal's up to, he doesn't want any witnesses.
lucky for us, he didn't realise one of his Jaffa uses tretonin.
any idea where he is now?
actually, yes.
the Jaffa was able to provide us with the coordinates, where Baal's ship is located.
the Odyssey is standing by. You move out again in one hour.
assuming for the moment this Jaffa is telling the truth and we actually find Baal's ship, how do you propose we capture Adria?
same way he got her off the planet. We beam in, tag her and beam out.
it's a big ship, Colonel. How are you gonna find her?
well actually, it shouldn't be that difficult.
we're assuming Baal has some sort of technology, similar to our own Anti-Prior device, otherwise she would have used her powers the instant he beamed her onboard.
if we scan for those specific E. M frequencies, we should be able to pinpoint her location with a fair degree of accuracy.
all this pre-supposes that we get the drop on him and he doesn't raise the shields.
Yeah.
alright then. Good luck.
vala, you got a sec?
sure.
you're welcome to sit this one out.
Why?
I mean, why would I?
you know why we're bringing Adria back, right?
sure!
to tell her to take her army and clear off.
and if she resists?
we will take action.
by killing her.
you're ok with that?
of course.
alright.
Wow!
I take it we are cloaked?
pretty cool, huh? - Yeah.
Colonel, the result of your scan is here.
this room shows a pronounced level of the same E. M radiation, generated by the Anti-Prior device.
looks like you were right.
let's go get her.
that's it.
don't worry, this will all be over soon.
odyssey, we are good to go!
Hey!
wake up!
sorry.
it's not very comfortable, believe me,
I know from experience, but we're not taking any chances.
it's over, Adria.
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
Adria's no longer available.
baal is in Adria?
Yes, sir. It's the bad guy equivalent of cordon bleu.
it actually makes sense from his perspective, sir.
not only has he taken on a more powerful host, but Adria is also in control of the Ori army.
so he convinces them to do his bidding and not hers.
well, when you think about it, their goals aren't all that different.
control of the galaxy. Worshipped by millions.
and if the Ori are dead, he'll never be called to the carpet by the boys upstairs.
what do we do now? - Kill them both.
hard to argue with that logic. It's a twofer.
well, there's not guarantee that her army would stop fighting, even if she WAS dead.
the only way to be certain, is for her to order them to stand down.
and how do we get her to do that?
well, if Baal's symbiote is supressing Adria's consciousness, we should be able to do the same thing.
swap Baal out for someone we can trust.
doesn't supressing the host, go against their fundamental beliefs?
well, I'm sure they'd make an exception in this case.
we've been trading intelligence with the Tokra, since the Ori first arrived.
they wanna get rid of them, just as much as we do.
get in touch. See if you can set it up.
in the meantime, keep a close eye on your guest.
so, have you decided what you intend to do with me?
well, we're still weighing our options.
Teal'c here, had a good idea.
I can imagine.
no, you cannot.
I must caution you against doing anything too rash.
in fact, your best course of action would be to release me.
I think we have a difference of opinion, there.
my whole plan was to order the Ori army back out of this galaxy.
you let me carry it out, we'll be rid of them forever.
that is our plan as well, only without YOUR participation.
what do you mean?
he means, we're gonna bring in someone a little more reliable.
see, right now, you're like a Pinto engine in a '71 Mustang.
we gotta swap you out for a big block Tokra.
it takes a great deal of effort to supress a consciousness this powerful.
the Tokra don't have the strength.
not to mention the fact that I'll kill Adria, the moment you try to remove me.
well that's great. We can live with that.
perhaps, but remember, I'm sharing Adria's mind.
you would lose all access to the knowledge I possess.
for example?
for one thing, I can confirm the Ori are dead...
and that's just the beginning.
with my knowledge and your...
pluckiness, we can accomplish a great deal.
remember how we worked together to locate the Sangraal?
as I recall, your efforts were not particularly helpful.
of course, it's your decision, but it seems you only have two options.
work with me to our mutual benefit or kill us both and miss out on everything I have to offer.
you're just in time. The Tokra contingent is about to arrive.
I am Juseen. I will be performing the surgery.
these are my assistants.
welcome on board the Odyssey. I'm Colonel Davidson.
I'm sure you know Colonel Carter, Doctor Jackson and Vala.
Yes.
I knew you as Quetesh.
things have changed a little since then.
news that the leader of the Ori army had been captured, came as a ray of hope to my people.
that being said, the extraction procedure that we are about to undertake, is extremely difficult.
even though we have refined the process, considerably, there remains a very real risk that Adria will not survive.
well, the only other option we have is to leave Baal in and trust he's telling the truth, so...
then we should begin immediately.
Zanuf, the symbiote we brought, cannot survive outside of a host, for long.
the infirmary's this way.
time to go.
what about our arrangement.
Oh, you mean the part where you string us along until you overcome the effects of the Anti-Prior device.
we'll pass.
sedative appears to be working. Heartrate and BP are holding steady.
there it is. Let's begin.
we will need to work quickly.
the symbiotes autonomic response can trigger complications, even under anesthetic.
initiating the first incision.
I need suction.
what's up?!
nothing!
just didn't feel like sticking around for the surgery.
you know, weak stomach and all that.
Hey!
you sure you're ok with this?
why does everyone keep asking me that?
because she's your daughter and no matter what she's done, it must be difficult to see her treated this way.
let's get something clear. She's not my daughter, Daniel.
the Ori impregnated me against my will and forced me to bring her into the galaxy.
I was an incubator. A shipping crate.
and nothing more.
I'm sorry, but I find it hard to believe that you don't feel something.
I do.
satisfaction at seeing their plan fail.
there!
I've severed the primary nerve conduit.
you see how the filaments are retracting?
now, moving onto the lateral.
what is it?
I was afraid this might happen.
Hey! What's up?!
trouble with the surgery.
what happened?
baal decided to be even more difficult than usual.
we were able to extract him, but not before he was able to release a deadly toxin into Adria's nervous system.
can't the Tokra symbiote heal her?
unfortunately, we were unable to complete the implantation.
the host body was simply too weak.
Adria is unconscious at the moment, but when she awakens, she will suffer greatly before she dies.
the one thing we can do for her, is an increased dosage of the toxin.
it will kill her instantly.
in the interest of patient care and for our own safety,
I recommend that we administrate immediately.
do it.
I'd like to be there.
crap!
you and your friends were trying to kill me, Mother.
I can't let that happen.
SG1, come in. What the hell's going on down there?
I'm getting reports that all sections around the infirmary are being sealed off.
it's Adria, sir. She's barricaded herself in.
is there any way you can beam us directly there?
negative!
she seems to be generating some kind of E. M interference.
we're gonna need a cutting torch down here, ASAP.
you got it.
there's an auxillary control console on this level.
if I can get to it, I might be able to override it.
go!
you can quit acting. You're obviously not sick.
Oh, this body really is dying.
I just wanna use what little time I have left as wisely as possible.
by doing what? Destroying me and my friends?
don't be silly, Mother.
if I wanted to kill you, I could have done it a long time ago.
no. I need time to prepare.
prepare for what?
ascension.
vala! - Don't!
vala, can you hear me?!
guys, it's Daniel. I can't reach Vala.
Daniel What is your location?
just outside the infirmary. Adria's locked them in.
we are blocked as well.
Colonel Mitchell is attempting to cut through one of the doors.
well you'd better hurry up. I think I figured out what she's trying to do.
Adria's trying to ascend.
Adria, you don't have to do this.
granted, this wasn't part of my plan, but I can still accomplish a great deal.
perhaps even more.
more what? More deaths? More enslavement?
don't attempt to play on my compassion, Mother.
as you said, I'm not your daughter, I'm an Ori.
part Ori, part Human.
that will soon change.
xxxxxxxx
Carter, how's that override coming?
it's not. I mean, it wouldn't do any good.
what the hell does that mean?
she's not actually in control of the system.
I think she's just holding the doors shut with her mind.
cutting torch would take too long.
what is it? - Your friends are very determined.
uh, Daniel, I'm showing a coolant leak in the hallway you're in right now.
got that, thanks. It's Adria! She's trying to distract us!
well it's a hell of a distraction. That stuff's toxic.
you need to get out of there, right now.
Yeah, that's gonna be a problem!
can you shut it down?
I'll have to reroute coolant out of the entire section. I'm on it.
vala, if you can hear me, I really need you to open the door!
Adria, stop this, please!
that's it.
I always wondered if you had it in you to kill me...
goodbye, Mother.
nice work.
wasn't us. Adria let go.
Jackson! - I'm ok.
Where's Adria?
she's gone.
and once Adria realised she couldn't save herself, she had no choice, but to ascend.
what do you suppose this means for us?
to be honest, I'm not sure.
if the Ori are still out there, then presumably, she's joined the fight.
but if Baal is telling the truth and the Ori are dead, then she just assumed all the power they once had.
either way, we could see some incarnation of her again, down the road.
holding a SERIOUS grudge.
at least we may take comfort in the knowledge that Baal is dead.
wouldn't put a deposit down on that just yet.
when we were breaking Adria out of Baal's ship,
I ran across another clone guarding her.
killed him, but where there is one...
there may be more.
we captured and killed Adria and Baal on the same day.
are you telling me this is all a wash?
No!
we dealt the Ori movement a serious blow, today.
and we rid ourselves of Adria for the time being.
that is DEFINITELY a step ahead.
destiny ...
the design is clearly ancient,
launched hundreds of thousands of years ago.
where the hell are we?
several billion light years from home.
we are on a ship,
but we have no idea where we are in relation to earth.
this ship could be the most important discovery
mankind has made since the stargate itself.
these are the wrong people, In the wrong place.
we've got a lot of wounded. We need to get home.
we barely have enough power to operate the main systems.
this ship simply doesn't have the capability to dial earth.
could you please stop people running around,
activating every bloody system they can get their hands on?
I will.
our reserves are gone.
all of our power is gone.
our trajectory has changed.
what are you talking about, Rush?
lieutenant, What the hell's he talking about?
ronald Greer.
I can't think of a better way to move on from...
this world into the next, or whatever comes,
than to fly into the most powerful thing In all creation
a star.
out in a blaze of glory.
I like that.
that's beautiful.
everyone here? All here, sir.
if I could have your attention?
you've all heard about our situation. It sucks.
I'm going to repeat the facts so that we are all clear.
in just over a day, this ship will fly into a star.
now, we have no power to change its course.
we have no idea how to steer the ship
even if we did. We are having another bad day.
so here's what we're going to do.
we have a working shuttle.
we think there are three planets out there
that might be habitable.
now, we think-- We believe
that it's no coincidence
that destiny dropped out of FTL in this solar system,
to give us a chance.
now, once we know for sure
that there is a planet out there for us,
we are going to have a lottery.
we will draw the names of 15 people
the shuttle can hold twice that many.
not once it's been loaded up with supplies.
besides, there's only life support for 17, max.
you said 15.
I will be choosing two of the people myself
two people with the necessary skills
to fly the shuttle and survive on the planet.
Yeah, I bet I can guess who they are! Yeah.
I'll be taking my name out of the lottery.
anyone who wants to join me, keep talking.
we're still several hours away from knowing
if the first two are even habitable,
so I suggest you all go back to your quarters
and wait it out.
that's all I have for now.
what?
you should pick everyone who goes on that shuttle.
it's the responsible thing to do...
and you should include yourself.
if they're going to survive, they'll need leadership.
and an HR lady, I'm guessing.
I am not above that. I would want you to consider me, yes.
I would want you to consider everyone
who could contribute to their survival.
I think you should do your job
and make the choices you need to make.
it wouldn't be very fair.
it would be more unfair to send the wrong people
we're all the wrong people!
these are the wrong people.
that's up to you.
okay...
okay, who goes?
other than you and me, I mean...
or haven't you given it much thought?
we can come up with a short list.
factor in skills and strengths
to increase their chances of surviving.
take age and sex into consideration
how 'bout just the people we like?
that's not what I'm saying-- - You need to leave.
handpicking just two of them is a cop out, and you know it
or I'm going to take your name out of the lottery.
I may just anyway.
please don't.
Eli!
God, you didn't even set your alarm.
Eli!
I don't have time for this.
I thought you had an interview today. - They canceled.
I was up all night. - Playing those stupid games.
they canceled, or you canceled?
seriously, mom, It's not my skill set.
nothing is.
I'm late. We'll talk about it later.
damn it.
I'm just hoping to find a planet, Grow some food,
not that I know a damn thing about farming.
you sound pretty sure we're both going. Yeah.
Yeah, maybe I am.
has he told you We're the two he's picked?
no, it's just obvious. - How?
there's only two qualified pilots On the ship, me and the Colonel.
he took himself out, so...
Yeah, well, that explains you. Why me?
come on, Chloe, he has to pick you. - Why?
you're the daughter of a U. S. senator.
he's probably been ordered to.
being a senator's daughter
isn't going to help anyone survive on that planet,
and I think the Colonel's the kind of man
who makes his own decisions.
I'm not one of the two, matt.
at least, I shouldn't be.
I don't even know if I want to be. - Don't say that.
there's still a chance that I'll get chosen in the lottery...
but if I don't, I want you to know that...
I have probably felt closer to you In these past few days
than I have ever felt to anybody, - So if this is goodbye-- - It's not.
it might be.
I'm glad he's going to pick you.
I want you there.
Yeah, well...
what are the odds? One in five, one in six?
something like that.
well, we'll see.
so how are you going to get the thing off the ship?
with the remote...
when the shuttle takes off.
we might even get one last look at the destiny From the outside
before it gets out of range. So...
what are you guys doing here?
we heard about your message in a bottle.
it started out as a documentary, actually.
well, um... We want to be part of it.
figured you'd be busy.
Eli, you realize the odds of anybody finding a kino out here
probably nil, I know. Let's do it anyway.
let's do something.
let's leave something of ourselves behind.
so who's first?
so, I... okay.
I'm Chloe Armstrong.
I'm 23, and, um...
I just want to say that my father gave his life
so that all of us could survive another day,
and we did.
another day.
sorry, you radioed me?
uh, yes, um...
the first planet is too cold. Frozen methane.
the second is too hot.
the third,
well, that happens to be behind the star at the moment.
too far away to determine habitability.
when will we know?
it doesn't matter. We don't have any choice.
we're going to have to launch the shuttle
before we can get close enough.
the odds are good, though.
its orbit is in between the other two.
the goldilocks zone, they call it.
not too hot and not too cold.
Yes. Just right.
what if we used the engines from the shuttle to push the destiny off course?
that's a good thought, but, um...
I'm afraid I've already run the numbers, and...
without getting into delta v
Thrust-to-weight ratios, then
not a chance. No.
well, when do we launch the shuttle?
we could wait a few more hours, But the extra time,
I don't think it's going to give us any more information
than we already have.
when the shuttle's loaded, then.
Colonel Young...
if, by chance, you were thinking of choosing me
as one of the two...
please don't.
Why?
this ship...
coming here was my destiny.
my life's work was to be here,
not trying to survive on some rock
with a bunch of strangers.
in fact, You can take my name off the lottery altogether.
look, Rush,
I realize I should've listened to you sooner.
no, no, I wasn't myself. - Still, you were right.
it really wouldn't have made any difference.
do you mind if I ask you who you are going to choose?
lieutenants Scott and Johansen.
I would've thought Scott and Greer. Yesterday's heroes.
I've got my fingers crossed for Greer.
well, you could easily arrange that.
you mean fix the lottery? - Yes.
no.
there'll be those who think you did anyway.
my name is Camile Wray.
my age is... none of your business, Eli.
if, um...
if anyone finds this within the next,
I don't know, 40 years,
tell Sharon that...
my last thoughts were of her.
the names of every person in this room
are written down on one of these pieces of paper.
Dr. rush and I have chosen to exclude ourselves.
if anyone else feels the same way,
now would be the time to speak up.
if your name is chosen,
you are to go directly up these stairs to the shuttle,
where you will be met by the two people
that I have already chosen.
lieutenant Scott has pilot training,
and TJ's skills as a medic will be essential on the planet.
if your name is not chosen,
you are to remain here until I receive word the 15 are aboard,
and the shuttle's rear hatch is secure.
does anyone have anything to say?
airman Becker.
go.
david Walters.
Camile Wray.
lieutenant James.
Dr. Park.
take a seat and strap in. - Yes, sir.
Mr. Brody.
sergeant Riley.
and Dr. Boone.
that's 15. We're done here.
you can fit more people on that thing.
Spencer, I need you to shut up.
come on, people! If we don't do something right now,
we're done!
he's right, we got to do something.
now, I don't want to have to do that to anybody else...
but I will.
that's it.
full count.
this is Scott. Everyone's aboard.
rear hatch is secure.
give yourself a 60-second countdown, Lieutenant.
some of us would like to see you off.
copy that.
we're releasing the docking clamps.
the kino's sending back pictures.
this is Scott. We're away.
you're looking good, Lieutenant.
I expect we'll be out of radio range
by the time we fire up the main drive, so...
we'll be thinking of you guys. - You too, brother.
you too.
Matthew, T. J... take good care of those people.
there it is.
that's the Destiny ?
thank you, Eli.
I never thought I'd get the chance to see the ship from the outside.
you know what? I think I'm going to go for a walk.
how does that sound, Sergeant?
sounds like a plan, sir.
I shall be in my quarters for the duration.
I have 100 pages of a truly mediocre book
to finish.
Eli, I, uh...
I'm sorry I got you involved in this.
actually... I'm not.
yet.
I'll probably be sorry at the end of the day, but...
we don't have that long, do we?
no.
how will it happen?
well, there will be turbulence from the solar wind, far worse than what we've previously experienced.
heat, obviously, and intense g-forces. I suspect the ship will be torn apart long before we reach the star.
hopefully it will be quick.
...and while I don't condone behavior of that kind
in any way, shape, or form, I gotta say,
the look on Telford's face when you put him down was priceless.
complete and total shock.
he was surprised, yes, sir.
I guess you can say you even got away with it.
I'm just, uh...
sorry I...
that I disappointed you, sir.
you're a good man, Sergeant. I know that.
besides, the bastard had it coming.
Yes, sir, he did.
so long.
at ease, Ronald.
okay, Colonel, just go whenever you're ready.
Yeah, no, no, I got it, I just, uh...
can you just wait outside, Eli? Thanks.
Hi, Emily, I just, um...
I just wanted to say...
well, you know. You know.
where is everybody?
all the fun people are here.
our father, who art in heaven...
hallowed be thy name.
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation...
what?
Oh, nothing, I just...
I realized it was past midnight.
does that mean they've gone into the sun?
no... no, no, no. no, nothing like that.
it's his birthday.
that's all he means.
happy birthday.
Thanks.
Mr. Brody, would you come up here for a second?
I need you to confirm a spectrographic analysis for me.
oxygen, nitrogen, liquid water.
only trace levels of Co2.
what?
it means there won't be much vegetation.
also means that the thermometer won't be spending much time above zero, either.
but we can survive, right?
Yeah. It'll be great.
uh, what are we so happy about?
we're going to live, Eli.
what about the turbulence and the heat and the death?
no. All of that would have happened by now.
the shield is protecting us.
but you said we were out of power.
I was absolutely certain of that, and I have never been more pleased to be wrong in all my life.
the lights just came back on in my room.
what's going on? Stand by.
Colonel!
you're right!
the systems are coming back online all over the ship.
there's a rumor spreading we're still here.
we are. Destiny needed all its power reserves to protect itself, and us...
uh, guys?
we're in the star.
that can't be right.
we're talking thousands of degrees.
well, we've just flown through the corona, which is even hotter,
to say nothing of magnetic fields, gravitational stresses.
this is what destiny intended from the moment it entered the star system.
you're telling me it flew into the sun on purpose?
Yes. - Why?
to replenish its reserves.
you're telling me this ship
the ship is powered by the stars themselves.
solar powered, quite literally.
there is no other explanation.
the engine just came back on.
we're pulling out of it!
the shuttle. We've got to call them back.
uh, we haven't accessed communications yet.
I'm working on it.
well, if you don't figure it out before we go into FTL
plenty of time. -We can't strand those people here.
this would be an excellent time for you to trust me to solve this problem.
okay, I'm going to put us in a high orbit, spend a little time looking around for the best spot before we put down.
they're gone.
you know, I can't help but think maybe they're the lucky ones.
don't, T. J.
the planet is a rock.
I said stop it.
all right, here we go.
this is Young, come in.
right there, right there!
t-this is Scott. sir, how the hell...
we're just as surprised as you are, Lieutenant.
I'll explain later.
you need to get your ass back aboard this ship.
look, there it is!
will do. Scott out! Everybody hear that?
Yes!
we have a visual of you, Destiny .
plotting an intercept course now.
uh, Colonel, stand by. Brody, come here.
what is it?
I don't know yet. am I reading this right?
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
we're so close, you can almost touch it. It's right there!
what's going on, Lieutenant?
the destiny is accelerating away from us.
we can't match it.
Colonel, we have a problem here. - What is it?
we can see you, but the shuttle's computer
cannot come up with an intercept solution.
destiny is accelerating too fast.
I'm trying to put something in manually here, but...
there's no way to cross the "t," sir.
we're going to fall short.
you're on full power, yes?
I put the throttle up right away.
it's-it's just not going to be enough.
you must have afterburners or something
it's not an f-16, Eli! It's a-it's a spaceship.
is there anything we can do from this end?
is there any way to slow the destiny down?
that-that would do it.
negative.
uh, we're out of ideas here.
come on, guys.
come on.
lieutenant...
I want you to turn and head directly towards the planet.
we'll send you the exact course in a moment.
no, no, no, no, no, the planet is a rock.
we'd rather take our chances trying...
do what I'm saying, Lieutenant. We don't have much time.
in order to reach the star,
destiny used an aerobraking maneuver to slow down.
I'm suggesting Lieutenant Scott
perform a slingshot maneuver around the planet
to do exactly the opposite.
a gravity boost to speed up.
it should put Destiny directly in our path.
we're all aboard with that idea, Doctor.
just give me the course and speed.
this planet's getting pretty big in the windows here.
one moment.
I got it.
Eli... There's many variables here. Are you sure about this?
math boy.
send it.
okay, math boy.
sending the new course now.
is this going to work?
it's going to be close.
got it. All right, everybody, hang on again.
that's them.
why am I watching this on TV?
okay, we're only going to get one shot at this.
wish it wasn't the first time I tried it.
there they are.
you've got us lined up. You're doing fine.
no, he isn't. We're coming up on them too fast.
lieutenant, our relative velocity Is too great.
unless you can match our speed,
you're going to crash into the ship.
uh, this is all we've got.
it's coming up pretty fast on us!
I know, I know, I know.
we have to come left!
a little this way, Lieutenant.
what we need is more speed.
fire maneuvering thrusters.
that might just make the difference.
main engines off!
uh, thrusters off. Docking clamps engaged.
we're still in one piece!
well done! Well done!
we're on our way down.
I'm dead serious about it.
that was, like... that was the worst shuttle docking
I have ever seen in my life.
what are you talking about?
I barely even dented it!
the grinding noise!
at the very least, there is a giant scrape along the bottom.
I'm going to make you put on a space suit,
go out there, fix it right now.
sergeant, we're going to need some of that high, high temperature - Spaceship paint for Scott here. - Yes, sir.
I believe I've found some.
Dr. Rush, have a seat.
these two have even showered.
no, thanks.
Aw, come on, we should celebrate.
celebrate what?
that we're back where we started?
Aw, come on, have a seat, Rush.
some other time.
all right, well, Becker, give him a double ration.
he deserves it.
Why's that, then?
I'm in a good mood.
we're to be rewarded at your whim, then?
no, no... Just stop.
what, you want some reasons? I'll give you three.
you were right about the power situation.
not really.
you figured out the subspace communications, how to call the shuttle.
we needed to get those supplies back.
you took your name out of the lottery.
so did you.
I was injured. you actually made a sacrifice.
unless you knew...
that destiny was going to make it all along.
Cheers, everyone.
Aw, let it go, sir.
he didn't know. I-I saw his face.
there's no way. - No.
what if he did?
he's right, sir. Let it go.
a lot of work.
the Design is clearly ancient,
launched hundreds of thousands of years ago.
where the hell are we?
several billion light years from home.
we are on a ship, but we have no idea where we are
in relation to earth.
this ship could be the most important discovery mankind has made since the stargate itself.
these are the wrong people, in the wrong place.
we've got a lot of wounded.
we need to get home.
we barely have enough power to operate the main systems.
this ship simply doesn't have the capability to dial earth.
Yeah, I read about these Chinese miners
that survived a cave-in for six days
by drinking their urine.
I'm going to go ahead and pretend I didn't hear that.
Yeah.
you know what they ate?
coal.
coal?
Yeah. It's a true story.
I mean, don't get me wrong, it was pretty stupid.
almost killed them.
water level's down again.
you're sure nobody went near that compartment on your watch?
Spencer came by and asked
if he could have a look in the tank.
Why?
he's a crazy person.
sir.
anyway, I said no.
nobody goes in there without my authorization.
sir.
maybe it evaporated when we went through the star.
it's a closed system.
all that water went somewhere.
we're down to half of what we had when we got here.
I don't understand this.
you're the one trying to get the recycling system up and running.
maybe there's a leak somewhere.
ship says it's fine.
if what you're saying is accurate...
it is.
then we've got a serious problem.
well, we wouldn't
if you did what I asked you to do in the first place...
Oh, please, can we stick to one problem at a time?
running out of water wouldn't matter if we just dial earth and go home.
I already explained that to you.
the ship's recharged. The power reserves are full.
that's the point, they're not!
well, where are we at, then, rush?
probably about less than 40% of original Design capacity.
you think I can't tell when someone just pulls a number out of his ass?
what?
uh, I actually pulled that number out of my ass.
he's not making it up.
look, if destiny was ever capable of dialing back to earth,
it was thousands of years ago,
when the ancients originally intended to come here.
but not now.
well, then, you're right.
we have a problem.
yes...
again.
okay, eli...
get Brody in on this.
he's an engineer.
I need to borrow eli.
40, 000 liters?
that's what I heard.
well, we didn't drink it.
let's just say it wouldn't surprise me
if there was more water than they're telling us.
so, what, they're hoarding it?
it's a big ship.
you know the military.
long as they control the water supply,
they control us.
that's right, I'm talking about you.
those two are harmless.
keep it up.
I need to know who I can trust.
I feel like a spy.
clean this room up.
right.
what is it?
nothing, sir.
just had a strange feeling.
well, we just dropped out of ftl.
wasn't that.
I'm on my way to the gate room.
there's a planet in range.
come on.
what have we got?
there's only one planet in range.
the ship's already dialed it up.
we're getting readings now.
whoa...
looks like we entered the hoth system.
empire strikes back.
the second star wars movie.
minus 47 degrees celsius.
bundle up.
is that water ice?
Yes, but the atmosphere is dangerously thin.
and poisonous.
13% molecular oxygen, 95% carbon dioxide, with a hint of Argon.
Ooh, nasty planet.
the only candidate within range.
we're going to have to use the spacesuits we found,
but if that brings back a half a ton of ice,
I'll take it.
shut it down for now.
lieutenant Scott, come in, please.
there a reason your radio's off?
come in.
Colonel young is looking for you.
uh, I think I'd better...
go, go.
what, you couldn't find a broom closet?
we're still working on the other suits.
we're close to having a third one ready.
how close?
a day, maybe?
we'll be back in ftl by then.
well, they're not in great shape.
all these years, there's bound to be degradation.
well, keep at it, we're going to need them.
looks like it's just you and me, then.
I could take kennair, sir.
she's done Eva's before,
and you're...
I'm fine.
how are we going to cut the ice?
plasma cutter.
should cut through the ice like butter.
just don't get the business end anywhere near you.
uh, suit radios are voice-activated between you.
press here if you want to tie into the ship's communication systems.
you're in command while we're gone.
is everybody clear on that?
Oh, I'm sure we'll manage.
start dialing.
assuming a fair amount of physical activity,
you have just over eight hours of air.
it's what 11 hours until the next jump to ftl,
right?
don't worry.
you'll run out of air long before we leave you behind.
Thanks.
beautiful, huh?
one deep breath, and you're dead.
destiny, this is young. Come in.
Yes, sir, we hear you five by five.
I've just tested the ice by the stargate.
I read concentrations of ammonia
and several other toxic chemicals.
how high are the readings?
off the charts.
well, you could try looking farther afield.
maybe on the other side of that lake.
is that really a good idea, sir?
the further away from the gate we go,
the less ice we can bring back.
Oh, I've got just the thing.
give me two minutes.
Colonel, give us five.
Eli has an idea.
uh, maybe there's fresh water in the lake under the ice.
at minus 47, the ice will be 10 feet deep.
we're better off finding a pressure ridge,
something we can mine.
sounds like you've done something like this before.
Oh, yeah.
a million times.
whoa, did you feel that?
it's just a tremor.
Hey, you know, the last planet I was on exploded.
destiny , this is young.
we're burning through suit air.
what's going on with this bright idea?
here we come, people!
here we come!
sorry, it's impossible to steer by remote.
that's fantastic, eli.
what made you come up with that?
A-actually, it represents my most recent attempt to fly,
but it should carry a ton of ice.
Colonel, we're sending through Eli's latest invention.
I love it!
the man gets a gold star.
how much will it hold?
definitely more than you can carry by yourself.
all right, we're heading out.
keep the gate active.
we'll radio back when we find something.
sir?
listen, if we don't make it back...
you will.
well, we're two guys in million-year-old space suits
walking around alone on an ice planet.
if we don't make it back...
you're going to do fine.
Yes, sir. Good luck.
the level's dropped.
again?
nobody's been in or out.
well, Brody said there's no leak in the system,
so that leaves one alternative.
who could steal that much?
that's a lot of water.
Yeah, I know, but I don't know what else to do.
besides, it wouldn't hurt to know where we stand.
start a search.
let's go, Gorman.
dial it up again, Mr. Riley.
we must maintain communication.
it just went off a second ago.
your timing is perfect!
because it's been 38 minutes,
the maximum time a stargate can remain open.
well, see, I didn't know that.
Colonel young, it's Dr. Rush.
what's your status?
we've found an exposed area of ice
that looks promising.
testing now.
we're pretty far out.
can't see the gate anymore.
it's still worthless.
keep looking.
lieutenant Johansen.
go ahead.
I found something.
so did I. Can it wait?
it's Spencer.
I can deal with him myself if you'd like, but...
no, it's fine. I'll be on my way.
I didn't steal anything!
yeah? What's this, huh?
those are mine!
I brought them through with me when we evacuated!
you brought them through with you, huh?
give me a reason.
Hey, hey, hey! Back off!
I don't have time for this!
lock him up somewhere.
the colonel can deal with him when he gets back.
you said you found something.
to be honest, I don't know what I saw.
I have to talk to rush.
you keep searching.
nothing we find is going to add up to what's missing.
I know,
but we have to know what we've got.
no one's gone near the tank, and it keeps going down.
come on, come on...
destiny ...
this is young.
we got pure ice.
that's excellent news.
it's a frozen waterfall.
we should be able to break it up
into manageable pieces and haul it back.
we'll be ready for you.
busy day on destiny .
I haven't taken anything.
I don't think you have.
what are you doing?
checking for stolen rations.
it's okay, Dr. Franklin.
confess, Miss Armstrong.
you drank 40, 000 liters of water.
he's kidding.
I know.
I'm just saying, we have rights.
I'm done here, Miss Armstrong.
I hope I haven't inconvenienced you.
I understand.
I knew that you would.
you.
next.
this is never going to be enough.
stand back.
you've done this before, too, have you?
at least five times.
you mind if I give it a shot?
remember, all we have are the bullets we brought with us.
so, are we talking about, like, one little cloud of bugs,
or are they all over the ship?
I'm not even sure that "bugs is the right word for them.
huh, what about "cloud?
except the cloud was alive.
it was almost like thousands of tiny alien creatures.
Yeah, I have a problem with everything you just said.
what you've just described is...
well, it's the same as lieutenant Scott claimed he saw on the desert planet.
that's what I was thinking,
and maybe some of them followed him back here.
wouldn't we have noticed them?
no, not if only a few came through the gate.
they're like tiny grains of sand.
and then what, started reproducing?
well, if it's a living organism, then yeah, they would.
okay, so now we've got aliens.
what if they start bursting out of our stomachs?
I don't think they're dangerous.
it almost felt like they were trying to communicate.
lieutenant Scott used the same word.
Yeah, at the time, you said he was delirious.
well, I was wrong.
what do you intend to do?
well, I guess we should stop everyone
from wandering around the ship.
after you.
um... Here?
Yeah, yeah.
this is lieutenant Johansen.
we have a situation.
it's under control,
but as a precaution,
I ask everyone to return to their quarters
and remain there until further notice.
thank you.
you're, uh...
you're not going to tell them?
that we've got aliens?
no, we'll keep it on a need-to-know basis.
what else?
you're in charge.
and I'm asking your advice.
what else?
always consider the greater good.
that's it.
that's enough ice for now.
let's get out of here.
gorman, meet me in the gate room.
we have ice on the way.
copy.
they're on it.
dial it back, please.
destiny, this is young.
how's it going up there?
offloading the sled now.
well, hurry it up.
we want to do one more run.
just so you know, uh, another matter has come up.
we have it under control.
we have aliens on the ship.
what?
they just shredded Gorman.
what the hell does that mean?
millions of tiny flying razor blades floating around the ship like piranha.
corporal Gorman is alive.
uh, lieutenant Johansen is tending to him now.
he's probably not going to make it.
that's it. We're coming back.
no, no, no, that's not necessary, colonel.
Eli is overreacting.
we believe the creatures are the same as those lieutenant Scott encountered
on the desert planet.
they must have followed us back through the gate.
no, I doubt those things I saw were dangerous, sir.
they...
they helped me.
corporal Gorman may have provoked them.
we'll know more once he comes to.
if he comes to.
in the meantime, lieutenant Johansen has ordered everyone to remain in their quarters.
they're nothing more than a nuisance at this point, colonel,
but we desperately need more ice.
all right.
we'll figure out what to do with them when we get back.
okay, sending the sled back through now.
rush out.
you're going to have to learn when to shut up.
you can't just...
you can't just lie to the guy and expect me to...
once back into ftl,
it could be days before we find another planet
capable of replenishing our water supplies.
this ice represents a fraction of what we need to stay alive.
we need more!
Yeah, I know!
but that doesn't mean that you can...
Yes, it does!
you're making it sound like we're...
just stop acting like a child, please!
we have to figure this out.
I said "we."
I say we torch 'em.
you know, put some teams together,
hunt them down.
Where'd you get that?
I can invent things too.
Hey, we've really got to work together on this project...
you know, maybe the bugs were just responding out of self-defense.
self-defense?
did you see what they did to Gorman's face?
Yeah, I'm the one treating him, sergeant.
I saw exactly what they did to his face.
look, we don't know what it is we're dealing with,
and "torching" them
may only serve to antagonize them further.
we hit them with something else.
Oh, revenge, that's great.
we-we got to do something.
if we just sit around
till they drink all of our water,
then we're going to...
alien bugs show up and half our water disappears.
don't tell me I'm the only one who made this connection.
well, obviously not.
the question is, what are we going to do about it?
okay, sergeant, you and your go team
go search for this alien...
entity, cloud, bugs, whatever it is we're calling them,
and report back, okay?
Yes, ma'am.
and sergeant? No torching.
Yes, ma'am!
Ooh, I have an idea!
it's going to be dark soon.
okay, stand back.
nothing's happening.
Oh...
Yes, there is.
it's like vapor.
we just can't see them.
that's what they did when I first saw them.
it's like they just disappear.
so they're growing in numbers exponentially,
and consuming our resources
without us even knowing it.
you have to get them off the ship.
sergeant Greer, come in.
I'm a little busy right now.
the bugs are getting into the water tank every time we open the hatch.
once we locate the main swarm,
we're going to have to find...
they're in front of me right now.
don't antagonize them.
I won't,
unless they antagonize me first.
do they move when you do?
they do now.
what we need is an airlock.
unfortunately, there are none in the habitable compartments of the ship.
I know what to do.
this isn't going to keep us going very long.
maybe destiny will figure out we're getting short on water
and find us a planet with nice fresh water
right next to the stargate.
I mean, come on, we deserve a break.
Scott, can you hear me?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, sir, the ice just gave way.
are you hurt?
negative.
I'm okay, but...
I'm wedged in pretty good.
good thing, too.
looks like a long way down.
all right, just hold on.
I'm going to ...
I'm going to throw a line down.
here it comes.
I need you to tell me when you've got it.
got it.
now, if you can manage it,
run it under both your arms
and fasten it across your chest.
done this before, too, have you?
Oh, yeah.
at least a dozen times.
okay.
now, I want you to pull yourself up.
I'm going to pull from this end.
you ready?
uh, yeah.
okay, one...
pull!
pull, Scott!
come on!
pull! Pull!
how stuck are you?
pretty dang stuck.
is there any way you can dig yourself out?
I'm not sure.
that's okay.
that's passed.
still here, sir.
all right, let's just, uh...
let's think about this for a second.
destiny, this is young.
go ahead.
we've got a situation here.
there was a tremor,
and Scott fell through the snow into a crevasse.
he's fine, but he's just out of reach.
I tried to pull him up,
but that's not going to happen anytime soon.
how's that other space suit coming?
we stopped work on that.
I confined everyone to quarters.
all right, it was just a thought.
we'll, uh...
we'll figure it out.
how's your bug situation?
same as before. Don't worry about it.
don't you worry either, T. J.
I'll be out of here in no time.
good luck. Johansen out.
everyone is lying.
Yeah, grown-ups do that sometimes.
this is Greer. It's working.
they're moving away from us as we move forward.
good job.
keep it up.
how about you lower the gun down,
and I shoot myself free?
Yeah, that's good thinking.
there's no way the bullets will ricochet into your ass.
well, maybe I can cut my way out with the plasma cutter.
you get one hole in that suit,
you're dead.
maybe there's a way for me to get down there.
no, that's just as stupid.
that's just as stupid, sir.
the last thing we need is for both of us to be stuck down here
you okay?
uh, closed in a little tighter,
but I think...
what?
what?
I think I'm losing suit pressure.
I thought we were supposed to be confined to quarters.
Yeah, well, I heard over the radio...
there was a tremor.
lieutenant Scott fell into a crevasse.
Oh, my god.
he's okay.
just... Stuck.
do they have enough air?
Colonel young says he's got it under control.
I just...thought you would want to know.
Thanks.
Yeah.
I think the ice tore a hole in his suit.
how big a tear is it?
I can't-I can't see it,
but I can hear it.
it's-it's hissing out pretty good.
an hour at most.
plenty of time to make it back.
Yeah, if I wasn't stuck!
Colonel, you have to consider the amount of time you have left now.
I'm aware of the damn time, rush.
all I'm saying is if you delay much longer...
listen to me!
I know exactly what you're saying,
and I'm not going anywhere without lieutenant Scott,
and that's the way it's going to be!
what is the matter with you?
miss Armstrong,
you should return to your quarters.
no, you know where you can go?
look, colonel,
I understand your desire to rescue lieutenant Scott,
of course,
and only you can decide
how much time you have left,
but lieutenant,
if colonel young remains there,
trying to free you,
to pull you up by himself,
there's a chance he might not make it back.
he's right.
just keep the gate active.
we're going to make it back in time with your damn ice,
which is all you really care about.
Colonel...
young out!
damn, he's a lot of work.
this is Greer.
I locked them up.
closing off the ventilation in that room.
okay, vents are closed.
should be airtight.
what are they doing now?
looking for a way out.
let's hope they don't find one.
come on!
come on...
sir...
Colonel?
I'm thinking.
go.
it's okay.
no, it's not.
come on, sir.
we both know you've done this before, too.
done what?
lost people.
too many times. I'm not...
I'm not doing it again.
I-I can't let you do it.
you don't have a choice.
not that I'm counting,
but this is the third time in almost as many weeks
that you've been willing to kill yourself, and there's...
there's a pretty good chance at this point
I won't be around to talk you out of it again.
you're a fine young officer.
you've got a heart as big as a house,
and I'm not here because I want to die.
I'm here because I haven't given up
on saving your ass,
so just shut up and think.
they're gettin' pissed off.
really pissed off.
a few of them got out.
what? How?
we need a plan, lieutenant!
I'm coming down there!
this is beautiful out here.
lieutenant...
lieutenant?
wake up, Scott!
lieutenant!
wake up!
I need you to wake up, Scott!
Scott, come on!
wake up!
come on!
lieutenant!
come on, I got you.
that's it, pull!
pull, lieutenant.
come on, lieutenant.
lieutenant!
okay, that's it.
okay, that's it, I got you.
I got you. Okay...
okay...
all right?
you're okay.
hey... Hey, Scott, come on.
hang on, kid.
what's the plan?
we open the door,
they go for the water, we close the lid.
all right, who's going to do that?
I am.
no, no, no, I will.
I'm not the one with the torch.
no, look, I am not going to let you do that...
I'm not the one who's killed any of them, sergeant.
you are.
I'll stand back, torch them if they get out.
no, I want you out of sight.
what, you don't trust me?
no, I don't.
all right.
Eli, I'm ready.
make us a clear path to the gate room.
seal off everything else.
you're good.
if this doesn't work,
lock this compartment off from the rest of the ship.
destiny , this is young.
I'm on my way back with Scott.
come in.
okay, let 'em out.
okay, I got 'em!
all right, dial the gate.
we're on our way.
destiny...
I'm almost at the stargate with Scott.
shut it down so I can dial in.
Colonel, we're about to send these alien bugs through to the planet.
we've no other choice.
what?
we need you to step away from the gate
and remain as still as possible.
they're coming through now.
get his helmet off.
Yeah, I got it.
give her a hand.
his pulse is thready, but he's breathing.
let's get him out of here.
sergeant Spencer,
you step out of line again,
I will deal with you personally.
understand?
Yes, sir.
I don't think he does.
Colonel, I need to talk to you about the behavior of one of your men...
no, that can wait.
we need to go over the new rationing amounts
before the next...
Colonel, I was scheduled to use the communication stones this morning...
Colonel! Colonel!
at approximately 03: 00 hours ship time,
corporal Gorman succumbed to injuries
sustained in an encounter with an alien entity.
lieutenant Johansen did everything that she could.
I intend to hold appropriate services tomorrow at 16:00 hours.
how do I turn it off?
I believe I had a vision last night.
I saw Kanaan, the father of my son.
save us.
where are you? - Dart.
I came for you, just like you asked.
like I asked.
I was the one in your visions.
I was sent back in time?
in fact, you were sent forward.
I've loaded all the intel we got on Michael after your disappearance, including the address where we found teyla.
quickly.
you must release me.
I know where Teyla is.
my child is of no concern to you.
I have great plans for him.
I think we're too early, though, but he's going to bring her here to have the baby.
Colonel, it's a booby trap!
we've got to get out of here now!
this is perfect.
just what I needed.
it truly has been a hectic several weeks.
try four years.
very true.
in a way, it makes these calmer moments even more special.
I cherish these times, when it is just you and me.
me too.
you...
you've got an early morning.
I never got to properly thank you.
for what?
for what?
for rescuing me from Michael.
I never gave up hope, because I knew.
I knew that you would come for me, john.
I know this sounds crazy, but...
I don't remember...rescuing you.
you don't remember rescuing her, because you didn't, just like you never rescued me.
Hey, buddy.
what happened?
Michael's compound, it collapsed on us.
I think I...
Yeah, hold on, let me take a look.
what the hell was that?
it's just a little scrape, no big deal.
what about the others?
I don't know.
we got separated.
try them on the radio.
there's no signal.
there's too much interference.
I'm pretty sure my leg is broken.
I think I'm remarkably fine.
well, isn't that wonderful.
that brings me great comfort.
thank you.
I don't think we're that deep.
I can see daylight.
if I could just...
I'm sorry!
I just posted Edison at the entrance to the building.
he'll get help.
that is, assuming he wasn't hit by falling debris.
doc, the Daedalus left Atlantis while we were still confirming Sheppard's story.
with that kind of a head start, they should be here in less than three hours, so one way or the other, help is on the way.
I'm sorry, I'm just not good in tight spaces.
but there's no bad guys around, okay?
no bad guys, just a lot of debris, so if you could please just sit tight and try not to make the ceiling collapse, that would be great.
okay, no bad guys.
just sit tight.
when did you get this?
moments ago.
change of plans.
we're setting a new course.
our compound has been compromised.
unscheduled off-world activation!
it's lieutenant Edison's idc.
search and Rescue
what happened? Where's the rest of your team?
there was a massive explosion.
everyone was in the main compound. The whole building imploded on itself.
were there any survivors?
radios are down.
I don't know. I just thought I should get back here, and
no, you did the right thing.
get him to the infirmary.
how far away is the Daedalus ?
still two hours out.
we can't wait that long.
have the combat engineers gear up, and have Dr. Keller ready her away team.
Yes, ma'am.
what are you doing?
I'm claustrophobic. I'm trying to keep my mind busy, which is hard, because, you know, it's my mind.
well, there's no way anything useful survived that implosion.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
you know what I mean, doc.
look, I found a bunch of computer parts, all right?
the motherboards are all fried or snapped, but some of these hard drives look like they might still be intact.
if I could just get the power to...
Hello, hello.
what, is it something good?
I don't know. There's a lot of information.
hold on.
I think I just hit the jackpot.
what? some way to broadcast a signal?
let people know our location? Speed up the rescue, what?
no, although, in hindsight, I would say you're right, that should probably be considered "the jackpot," but no, this is a hard drive.
I can only access what's on it.
which is?
it's Michael's wiki.
it survived the explosion.
the what?
Michael's database.
it's a large chunk of it, maybe the whole thing, too.
I mean, we've got base schematics, medical research information, lists of planets.
do you know what this means?
Yeah, it means we're still stuck here, and I still have a broken leg.
Yeah, in the short term, but if we get out of here
if?
we have him on the run. He'd be finished!
look, if Michael...
Oh, no.
what?
look, I-I don't want to concern you any more than you actually already are, but if I'm reading this correctly, then Michael is
shut up.
no, no, you shut up. This is important.
if michael is
quit making noise!
it's footsteps.
okay, revise that. Start making noise.
down here!
we're down here!
help! Help!
all right, we've got four lifesigns in two different locations.
first two should be right beneath us.
listen...
we're down here!
down here!
down here!
McKay? Is that you?
Oh, thank god, yes!
I'm trapped down here with lorne!
are you okay?
we're fine!
Hey, doc. - Right, right, right.
okay, Lorne's got a broken leg!
all right, Mckay, stay put.
we've got combat engineers here.
we're going to dig you out.
well, hurry up!
we'll work as fast as is safe, Rodney!
no, no, no, you don't understand.
I just found out that when the self-destruct is initiated, it's automatically programmed to send a subspace burst.
Michael's probably already on his way!
it's doesn't look like they're too far down.
we should be able to get them out inside of an hour.
well, what about the other two?
they're a lot deeper.
well, the Daedalus will be here soon, so then we can just beam them out, right?
as long as Michael doesn't get here first.
all right, let's get started!
rivers, take a jumper into orbit and keep a lookout for Michael's ship.
let me know the second he gets here.
okay
this thing ain't moving.
I wonder what happened to the others.
I don't know.
it happened pretty quick. I doubt that many people made it out.
so stupid.
of course the building was booby trapped.
I should have seen that coming.
Yeah, well, none of us did.
Yeah, but i'm the guy.
you know, like, "the guy."
everyone knew what we were getting into.
we all knew how dangerous it was, so don't beat yourself up about it.
you need to start thking about how to crawl your way out here.
no way.
I'm serious. You just keep moving up, keep moving the debris.
work your way up.
I'm not leaving you behind, Sheppard.
I'm not trying to be a hero here.
it's a selfish thing.
I need you to dig a hole so that the rescuers can come down and get me.
that's the wrong way, chief.
we get this beam off you, we get you free, we dig ourselves out together.
deal?
you ain't going to listen to me one way or the other, are you?
great. Deal.
excellent.
this is all very good.
your son should be making an appearance any day now.
I thought that would make you happy.
I can't imagine carrying a child inside of you is very comfortable.
I will not harm him.
why can't you just accept that?
because I know you.
all these worlds, filled with people, busying themselves with their pathetic lives.
they come and they go.
they live and they die, and the galaxy is no better for it.
but your son...
your son will be an instrument of change.
he will be remembered for the ages.
and what of his mother?
you speak often of his future, but never of mine. Why is that?
I had hoped that you would...
I had hoped that you would understand-- - it's time.
very well.
remove the restraints, and post a guard outside this door.
I must escape before our child is born.
he will kill me once I am of no use to him.
I can'T.
kanaan, why?
it is too dangerous. - For who?
he will kill us.
kill us all.
Yes, he will, whether you help me or not.
you are disposable to him. Can you not see that?
listen to me.
please...
please!
come over here.
I'm fine. It's just a...just a couple scrapes.
wow, Rodney Mckay refusing medical help.
now I really know there's something wrong.
seriously, I'm okay.
just, you should look after lorne.
any survivors?
we found two other lifesigns, but they're buried under a lot more debris than you were, so it's going to take a little longer.
we've got people working on it.
know who it is?
not yet.
Rodney, did you find teyla?
no.
no, but I think Sheppard was right.
he was going to bring her here. We just-- we came too soon.
Colonel carter.
go ahead.
ma'am, a wraith cruiser just came out of hyperspace.
Michael's here.
multiple lifesigns.
it must be the Atlantians...
they're combing the debris, but they must know it's too dangerous to stay here.
they're searching for survivors.
this might not be a total loss after all.
everyone fall back to your jumpers!
we've got incoming!
good shot.
all right, let's fall back to our jumpers.
we've still got men trapped down here.
they're going to have to wait.
we're no good to them out in the open like this.
let's go! Fall back!
cloak the ship.
got it.
we're getting a reading. The gate's been activated.
it's classic wraith battle technique.
they dial the gate, lock everyone out, make sure they can't escape.
well, it's a good one. - Yeah, well, they're not idiots...
we've got more darts on the way, and they've already got troops on the debris field.
they must know we've got people down there.
how many jumpers do we have?
three, including this one.
I'm reading over 20 darts.
but they can't see us, though, right?
well, not right now, but we can't fire while we're cloaked.
it's going to take them time to dig them out, the same as us.
we wait for the daedalus. Rodney, take us into orbit.
darts reporting nimal resistance.
they've already started searching the debris.
we must work fast.
I need them alive.
there it is.
is that Michael's cruiser?
well, it looks like it.
does that mean that Teyla's on that ship?
it's possible.
well, that's great, though, right?
when the Daedalus shows up, we can just beam her up too, no?
it's not as easy as that.
chances are Michael's already removed her transmitter, and even if he hasn't, wraith cruisers surround themselves with an electromagnetic jamming field
no beaming in, no beaming out.
we're so close.
come on, one more try.
I'm feeling pretty weak, buddy.
you're not quitting on me yet, are you?
no.
I was thinking about it.
that wasn't part of our deal.
you keep adding things to this "deal" of ours.
right.
ready?
you need to get out of here.
would you leave me if I was stuck under there?
Yes.
you hear that?
what?
it sounds like digging.
Yeah, I hear it.
I hear it.
hey we're down here!
we're coming for you! Just stay calm!
and you were going to quit.
status?
reading another ship in orbit.
it's a wraith cruiser.
shields up. Ready forward beam weapons.
sir, I'm receiving a coded transmission from colonel carter.
Sam, what's going on?
long story short, that's Michael's cruiser, and he likely has teyla on board.
so I can't blow him out of the sky?
no, I'm afraid not.
we're taking fire, sir. Shields are holding.
they managed to get their shields up before we hit them.
that's unfortunate.
transfer power to the hyperdrive.
what about the darts?
acceptable losses.
he's running.
not if I can help it.
target his hyperdrive.
Yes, sir.
we've lost hyperdrive.
I guess we're fighting after all.
shields are down to 80%.
Daedalus, we still have two people on the planet.
it is just a matter of time before the hybrids reach them.
can you scan for transmitter signals?
stay calm. We're almost there.
I'm going to stop making fun of combat engineers as of today.
I promise.
is Harris up there with you?
Yes, he's here. Don't worry, we'll have you out soon.
I thought Harris was on leave until next month.
if we get out of here, beer's on me, boys.
what do you like, duff beer or oprah ale?
well, they don't watch the Simpsons or drink beer.
Michael's hybrids?
I bet he was tipped off when the building blew.
I told you, you should have gotten out of here.
Yeah, whatever.
I can't reach my gun.
here.
all right, how you want to play this?
shoot till we can't shoot anymore.
all right.
it's been a pleasure.
same.
we got 'em.
it's colonel Sheppard and Ronon.
can you beam them up?
we'd have to drop our shields. I kind of think that would be a bad idea right now.
look, if Michael gets his hands on them, he'll kill them.
we don't have a choice.
all right, get ready to drop the shields.
as soon as they're down, beam Ronon and Sheppard directly to the infirmary.
Yes, sir.
Sam, you might as well bring your jumpers onboard at the same time.
understood. We're in position.
all right. Do it.
we've go them! Jumpers are in the bay.
shields up!
enemy vessel has raised shields again, but we scored several direct hits.
keep firing!
how are we doing?
not so good.
we've lost sub-light, hyperdrive, and asgard weapons.
life support's down to 50%.
what about the shields?
well, they're holding for now, but we're basically dead in the water.
don't touch me.
we thought we'd lost you there.
Yeah, well, for a second, I thought we'd lost me.
it's going to be okay, though, right?
yeah...
you need some serious work, but you should, you know, live to fight another day and all that.
so what's going on?
I guess Michael showed up before the Daedalus...
Yeah, we had to lower the shields to beam you up here.
sorry about that.
well, I'm sure Mckay and colonel Carter will be able to fix it.
McKay's alive?
Yeah.
Yeah, he and Lorne were the only two to make it out of the rubble.
patch me up. I need to get back out there.
what? No, no, no.
look, you will be fine, but you're far from it now.
you've lost a lot of blood.
you need surgery and a transfusion. I mean, this can't wait.
look, doc Michael's here.
that means Teyla's probably on the ship.
I'm too close to sit here and do nothing.
you're not going to be sitting around doing nothing. You're going to be lying here in surgery.
there's got to be, like-- there's got to be a quick fix.
no. - I need a few hours.
I'm sorry. I can't.
I have had the chance to rescue a teammate before, and it slipped though my hands.
I am not letting that happen again.
nice one.
of course.
life support's still not working at full power, but at least we won't freeze to death.
well, I've almost got sublight back online, but the way these guys are taxing our shields, we won't have any power to spare anyway.
we need to take out the cruiser's main weapons.
Yeah, with what?
we could launch a 302 attack.
that's what I was thinking.
Colonel.
Dr. Keller said you were out of commission.
she... revised her diagnosis.
look, we may have an idea.
maybe a way to get Teyla back.
we need to take out the cruiser's main weapons.
easiest way for us to do that right now is to launch an attack with 302s.
I wouldn't exactly call that easy. They'll just send out darts to intercept them.
that's what we're counting on.
in order to launch the darts, they'll have to open the bay doors.
if we have a cloaked jumper in place, a small team should be able to sneak onto the cruiser undetected...
find Teyla, bust her out, and blast our way home.
as a rule, I like to keep daring rescues down to one a day.
look, shields are already down to 20%.
it's just a matter of time before they fail completely.
she's over there, steven, counting on us.
I won't take no for an answer.
all right, take a cloaked jumper. Radio us when you're in position.
John, what really happened in the infirmary?
nothing.
so you're telling me if I go down there right now and talk to Jennifer, she'll tell me that you're fit for duty.
just trying to do the job.
so am I, and part of my job is determining whether or not you're going to be a liability on this mission.
Colonel
I have more respect for you than any commanding officer I've ever had, but
I'm getting on that jumper, end of story.
I'll surrender for court-martial when I'm done.
you know, Ronon and i could probably handle this.
maybe you should stay with the jumper.
or not.
Daedalus, we're in position.
confirmed.
launch 302s.
302s are approaching.
cue the darts.
it's closing.
I see that.
it's closing quickly. - I got it.
Daedalus, we're in.
it worked.
cruiser just lost main weapons.
let's hope that Sheppard has the same luck.
all right, this won't take more than a couple of seconds.
that's... troubling.
what?
Michael's a lot further ahead with his repairs than I would have thought.
the hyperdrive is almost back on-line.
we've got to make this quick.
what do you mean, "quick"?
well, like, 15 minutes is not a lot of time.
no, that's not a lot of time, so why don't you tell us where teyla is already.
righ right, right, right.
got it. Okay.
follow me.
or you.
we're going to get you out of here!
not a moment too soon.
we got to get you back to the jumper.
you okay?
it's my baby.
what? Is something wrong?
no
I've been having contractions for over an hour now.
they're very close.
my baby's coming.
I'm sorry.
I just need a moment.
I'd carry her, buddy, but I'm not really up to it.
Yeah, okay. You ready?
I can walk.
I just need a moment.
uh, say, friends, we have a small issue here.
Oh, what now?
looks like Michael's got his hyperdrive back on-line.
it's powering up.
can you shut it down? - Not from this little thing.
the drive room is down the corridor.
you slap a c4 charge on that thing, it should certainly shut it down.
where?
here. I have a map.
all right.
Ronon, you're with me.
I'll be right back.
everything's going to be fine.
you take care of her.
so, how you doing?
the pain is very great.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I had a kidney stone once.
incredibly painful.
same kind of thing, from what I'm told, so I hear you.
actually, my cat and i had one at the same time.
we were not fun to be around. He got his 'cause he was eating too much dry cat food.
I got mine 'cause I wasn't drinking enough liquids.
that's why you always see me hydrating. I have no desire to experience that kind of pain again.
Oh, it's just-- - fascinating story. Thank you.
Yeah, it's no problem.
okay, just-- just breathe, okay?
what are you doing?
it's supposed to help with-- look, I don't know what I'm doing.
what do you need me to do?
okay, there, there. There they are. There, there.
the baby is coming.
just hang on. We'll get you to the infirmary on the Daedalus, and keller can...pull it out.
the baby is coming now.
it's almost powered up.
give me your c4.
here, give it to me.
I got it.
give it to me. You don't have to do everything.
all right, you ready?
let's go.
all right.
let's hope we're far enough away.
Yeah, we'll see.
fire in the hole.
what happened?
the hyperdrive just exploded.
no, that's impossible.
main power is out across much of the ship.
an accidental overload?
it doesn't appear that way.
how did they do that?
I will look into it.
they're onboard.
how did they get onboard?
well, can't you just hold it in?
no, Rodney!
this doesn't happen this quick. No one has babies this quick.
my water broke quite a while ago.
I've been trying to
I can see its head!
that's good. That's a good thing, rodney.
Yeah, but am I supposed to touch it? Am I allowed to touch you down there? I don't know what to do!
Rodney, calmown.
I need you to be calm.
but I'm not an md. I've never been an md.
people have been having babies for thousands of years, most of them without doctors.
Yeah, but before doctors, the infant mortality rate was incredibly high.
it was only like one in three, I think.
look, a doctor is a very important part of this process.
trust me.
there are no doctors around.
you have to do this!
we don't have a choice.
okay, okay.
now, yoo need tcatch him.
catch him?
Yes. You need to catch him when I push him out.
Oh, god.
okay, well just...
underhand him, all right? I've never been good at baseball.
please.
okay, I can do this.
all righ look, I may have panicked a little back there, but we're going to do this.
I am great with kids.
the little ones, the son that don't talk back.
here he comes.
OK, Almost there. Almost there.
I caught him!
I caught him.
he. a boy.
watch his head...
right, right.
okay, so, cut.
OK. Look at him.
do I get to cut the cord?
I get to cut the cord, then, right?
okay, there you go.
Yeah, okay.
so... okay.
I'd like to introduce you to your son.
wow...
I caught it!
it didn't hit the floor or anything.
he did a wonderful job.
that's good...
you did good, Rodney.
all right, we-- we've got to get you out of here.
Ronon, you're going to need to help me.
why isn't it de-cloaking?
let me see. Did you break it?
I don't know.
we parked the jumper right here. - Yes
someone stole the jumper?
this is not good...
I told you, you should have stayed here.
how the hell are we supposed to get off the ship now?
I just delivered a baby. That's not enough for today?
don't they have escape pods or things like that on a cruiser?
no, they
wait, I know.
I need to get back to a data terminal.
a lot of their internal power's down. Maybe I can short out the jamming code. We can get the daedalus to beam us out.
great, lead the way.
don't shoot!
put me down.
it's all right, John.
this is Kanaan.
he is the father.
this is our chance.
these are the friends I told you of.
they can help you get back to your old self, but first, you have to help us.
we must get off this ship.
do you know a way?
Yes.
follow me.
no offense, Teyla, but I don't trust this guy.
he was trying to save me before.
I trust him.
give me your weapon.
what's your plan?
sir...
we've got a dart trying to hail us.
what?
let me hear it.
this is colonel John Sheppard, authentication code
Daedalus, please come in.
authenticated. Colonel, what the hell happened to your jumper?
I got turned around in the parking garage.
I was in a rush, so I borrowed this dart.
I've got the team beamed into a storage device.
do you have Teyla? - Yes, and the baby.
you beamed a baby into wraith storage?
no.
I got him right here, so feel free to do whatever you want to that cruiser.
copy that.
major Marks, please make that ship go away.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Sheppard, why don't you head down to the planet, beam your crew out, and land that dart?
I'm pretty sure you can dial up that stargate now.
copy that.
Hey, what's with the bags?
what's with the flowers?
going to see Teyla. You probably heard, uh, I delivered her baby.
I did, and they tell me she's going to name him Rodney.
Yes! Really?
no. Not really.
Oh, that's funny.
where are you going?
back to earth.
what? Why?
Oh, they've caught the last ba'al clone.
the Tokra are going to extract the symbiote. They want sg-1 to put in an appearance.
okay.
Plus, the I. O.A. want to do an "exhaustive" review of my first year in command, so, you know, that can't be good.
are you crazy? They probably want to give you a medal. You had a great year.
I know my opinion doesn't mean much to those folks, but
I think you've done an excellent job.
I'm glad you took the post.
Thanks, Rodney. That means a lot.
tell Sheppard the court-martial will have to wait.
sure. See you soon.
hope so.
how long will the surgery take?
doc says a few hours, but I'll be off my feet for a week or so.
I cannot believe you attempted to mount a rescue in your condition.
Attempt"?
last time I checked, I succeeded.
how's the kid?
Dr. Keller says he's perfectly healthy.
I say he's perfectly everything.
that's great.
I want to thank you.
there's no need.
I never gave up hope, because I knew...
I knew that you would come for me, john.
you would have done the same for me.
Yes.
all right.
you ready, colonel?
ready?
from my understanding, I'm not doing anything.
Yeah, that's right.
you just have to lie still and let me play with your insides.
sorry.
um, let's go.
what are you going to name the kid?
well, if it's all right with you, I was thinking of Torren John, after my father, and after you.
Really?
McKay's going to hate that.
I would be very honored.
very well.
Colonel carter.
Mr. Woolsey, how are you?
very well. Thank you for asking.
so is this whole evaluation process going to take very long?
I mean, there's a lot of work to be done on Atlantis, and I'm kind of anxious to get back.
I'm sure you are.
however, the I. O.A. Has decided that perhaps someone with a different skill set would be more suited to lead the Atlantis expedition now.
excuse me?
I'm here to inform you that, effective immediately, you are being removed from command.
who's replacing me?
as a matter of fact...
I am.
hello
I want an extra-large pizza, double cheese and pepperonis and anchovies, please.
I'm sorry but we don't serve pizza here.
we don't even have anchovies.
okay, fine. If you don't have the anchovies, fine. Pepperoni is okay.
we don't serve it because we can't make it.
and as a people, we're inclined to be lactose intolerant.
...so no cheese.
damn it, I want a pizza! I'll pay extra! Okay?
egg roll?

I'd like to take her ass and just -- mnh-mnh mnh-mnh mnh!
so, anyway, we're off.

is your son going with you? - No, no, no. He's 15.
he can stay home and watch porn for a few days.
all right.
I'll see you -- with my big fat taN.

Hello? - Hello, darling!
mother. - So, I will be in town tomorrow, just a flyby, for a conference, you know.
cleft palates, little webbed fingers, whatever else the newbies at yale don't know how to do
and we can visit.
I cannot wait to have dinner with you and your adorle phil.
it's just been too long. - Six months, actually.
Oh, how terrible, darling. I cannot wait.
and, sweetheart, get bombay gin, yes?
I do love a decent martini. - A decent martini.
she hung up. - Why not? She got her message across.
rosalind warren, the world's greatest pediatric surgeon, is coming to town, extra-dry martinis are in order, and phil eriksen is wonderful.
I'm a complete coward.
put me in yellow and call me quisling.
I don't blame you. I wouldn't want to tell her we were separated either.
she's crazy about me.
and "complete coward" is harsh.
it's just so priggish and just so unforgiving and just...
so like you.
I would kill for a martini.
the Sunlight Program
Dr. Banks, I need to speak to you.
and good morning to you, dr. Kalid.
I really need to speak to you. - I'm right here.
here? - We got no secrets from each other.
we're like family. - Duly noted.
if any of your young friends enters my office again, be it for a pencil, a paper clip,
I don't care if they're looking for a bloody defibrillator,
I will file charges against them and it will not go well.
did something happened?
him and her. Copulating in my office.
in your office?
not in your master- of-the-universe armchair?
Mariel. Luis. I want to talk to you.
I don't like him.
faggot.
damn towel head.
he comes all the way over here to our country to piss all over us like we're scum.
I got a cousin fighting in iraq who could kick his camel-jockey faggot ass.
that's what people do, right?
spic. Whore. Nigger.
it's what we do.
we say the most hateful, hurtful words we know just so we can feel better about ourselves.
we can do better than that, people.
I don't want to hear "bitch" or "ho" or "spic" or "nigger" in this room.
hatred kills.
it corrodes like an unchecked cancer. - Dr. Martin luther king said that.
that's right, honey. And I won't have it.
get your asses to my office right now, and you keep this damn thing on.
thanks for seeing us on such short notice, anne.
you were the best supervisor I ever had.
you said "family crisis." - Yeah. We don't have time for therapy.
my wedding's saturday -- that'd be the day after tomorrow
and the whole gang's staying at my place.
I told my folks here I don't care what andy wears.
she's my sister, and I love her.
maid of honor, man of honor, I don't give a damn.
well, I do, and even if you are a big doctor now, please watch your mouth, meredith.
we have family coming from rhode island and illinois and colorado, people we haven't seen in years, and andrea wants to dress up like a boy.
what are you gonna do? She's the maid of honor.
the other three girls are all going to wear...
what girls wear at these things.
um, I prefer andy.
sure. Andy, would you like to let me know how you see all of this?
look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, mom. I really am.
but I am just not a girl. - You are a girl.
I am not gonna fight about this again.
I do not feel like a girl and certainly not the kind of girl that you think I am.
mom, I am transgendered, like I've told you about a billion times before.
and it feels weird and awful and completely inappropriate for me to be wearing this.
well, good god. That's not a dress. That's a punishment.
I wonder...
I think it might be most helpful if I see andy alone tomorrow. Okay?
great. 47 hours to go.

Hello? - Hello, is mr. Carson at home?
he's out right now.
is this david carson? - Yeah. Who's this?
this is dr. Kalid. Uh, I work with your father. Will he be in later?
no, they're gone.
Damn! Damn!
didn't he say -- - it's all right. It's all right.
your parents are in st. Barths. He told me.
are you all right?
I'm fine. I can manage. I'm not a kid.
I don't need a babysitter. - Of course not.
does that mean you're on your own?
it's not a big deal. - Certainly not. I'm sure you're fine.
you sound like an intelligent and resourceful young man.
I'm sure your parents left you a list of names in case there's a problem.
listen, I really can't talk right now.
if you do need to talk to someone, you can call me.
I can call you? - Yes. Yes, you can. Call me.
555-0196. - All right. Bye.
it'll be fun. - No, it won'T.
sex with twins, fun. Dinner with your mother, not at all fun.
I'm sure you see the difference. - She loves you! She'll see you, she'll melt over your accent, like she always does, you'll share some fond memories of edinburgh, plus martinis, and we won't even get to "phil and anne are separated.
no.

you're always telling me, "grow up and face life.
see how you like it, darling.
lost?
I'll be brief.
consider this a formal complaint.
I think cordelia's teenagers
Cordelia has kids? - No.
in and out of the basement, day and night.
there are teenagers living in the basement? - No.
a bunch of unwed mothers and their thug boyfriends.
I meet twice a week with 8 teenagers from town
all committed to finishing high school, all holding down part-time jobs
well, except for one girl 'cause she's got a baby.
she is an honors student.
it's a great thing. - They trail their garbage everywhere.
I don't think we want those kind of kids around here.
some of us may not think that the erectiley dysfunctional, the grossly hair-challenged, and the personality-deprived are the ideal clientele, but we don't tell you who to treat.
she is funny. She really is.
Barry, you're a lawyer.
the point is...
the last thing any of us need is a lawsuit.
let's just say one of my little old ladies or one of your clients walk out the door and slip on a wet condom...or worse.
look, I don't expect james to give a damn.
he doesn't think about the real world at all.
but you know how litigious the world can be.
I'm just saying...
why not go down to the basement and check for yourself?
make sure there are no code violations.
make sure we're not going to have any problems.
if you think everything's kosher...
then that's fine with me.
I would just like to see myself as I am, you know?
I look in the mirror, in what they want me to wear, and that girl is just so not me.
it's just so wrong. It feels like I'm in drag.
can you see me in this?
hell no. I mean...
look at this dress. Where should we start?
the color, the style? The political implications?
what is this -- a nationwide attack on the unmarried?
the color sucks. The shoes suck even more. I look awful.
how do you put up with this crap?
...the first grade, and it was the worst day of my life.
you know, this is a little unusual, but your sister said it's a crisis.
maybe we should go shopping.
damn it! Didn't you hear what I said yesterday?
Dr. Kalid!
I'm sorry. I-I thought you said I could.
uh, david carson?
it's okay. I thought...never mind. Sit down.
close the door. Sit down.
what can I do for you?
well, I-I just thought that, you know...
I-I just thought that... - mr. Carson, you came to my office for a reason.
well...I mean, it's vacation, and there's no school.
this place seems kind of cool.
Really?
Yeah, I mean, I can't just sit in my house all day.
it's -- it's kind of...
I could hang out here. - Here?
looks good.
fine. It looks disgusting, but you seem to like it.
look, you're an expert on kids. - Well, as are you -- two of your own.
so I have this boy around, I don't know, uh, 15.
his parents went on vacation, and now the poor kid's all alone and not doing so well.
that's dreadful.
some people shouldn't be allowed to have children.
perhaps you could find a program for him or you could even see him yourself, until I get ahold of his parents.
I don't see kids over 12.
couldn't you make an exception? - Certainly not.
what kind of backbone would that demonstrate?
you know, you could handle this yourself.
I'm not trained to treat adolescents.
I believe you.
okay, okay. There is a very good program for adolescents right in this area.
Really? - Why don't you ask cordelia?
darling! - Mother.
and you are? - This is andy canetti.
Andy, this is my mother, dr. Rosalind warren.
how do you do?
fabulous. Completely charming.
so, where are we off to? - Shopping.
we'll be back in two hours. - Marvelous! Always an adventure.
Bye, frederick! - Roz, you come back anytime.
if I'm not back in three hours, send dogs.
new Haven Psychiatic Associates
may I speak to you?
I need your advice. - Come on in.
I'm sorry.
I really, really am sorry.
I shouldn't have gone on like that.
they're not bad kids. I know.
and you're doing a very, very good job.
I really do need your advice.
these people went on vacation and left their kid behind.
so now he's all alone. - What is it you want?
I need someone to watch him.
you've got your program.
some of the kids are down there all day. Couldn't he join them?
join the unwed mothers and thug boyfriends? I don't think so.
please. I'm doing my best. This isn't even my actual responsibility.
besides, you love kids.
you've got that special -- - what do you think?
because I am black and a woman,
I was put on this earth to carry helpless little white children to and fro?
of course not. I'm desperate.
I'm groveling.
groveling is good.
you can bring him this afternoon.
if he's not a disaster, he can come again tomorrow.
by then, the parents better have their asses back here.
and...
this will be the last time I ever have to listen to complaints about my program, won't it?
Yes.
Oh, this is flattering. You would look so pretty in this.
you should wear it tonight. Phil loves you in this color -- celadon.
makes me look as if I'm dying of cholera.
all right. No need to be balky.
let's just see how people look. Lead by example, why don't you?
come on, come on, come on, come on.
Hey.
you do see, don't you, that humiliation and social anxiety ile not exclusive to people who are transgendered?
worse, but not exclusive.
and that when we're in the process of becoming and even after, other people, especially our parents, fail to perceive us as we know ourselves to be.
Yeah. I see that now.
Anne? Come out.
are you gonna show her?
not on your life.
now, that is how a tuxedo should be worn.
you look great.
okay, I hear you.

just pick up the phone and call me.
Hello? - Hi, it's anne.
Hey, great. - I need a favor.
come to my house tonight? - I can't hear you. Tomorrow night?
no. Tonight. My house.
mother's... - this is a terrible connection.
my house. - Okay, great. Tonight.
Yeah, I'll be there.
I want to see you. I'll bring flowers.
Hello? - Okay, great.
you did hear me say my mother's here and I haven't told her we're separated?
not a word.
Where's david? - I don't know.
good night, rosa.
I left him in your care.
no, you left him with the sunlight program, from which students may come and go, if they follow the rules.
he signed out, he demonstrated that he was going home in a safe way, and although nothing required it,
I instructed him to call you and I left a message for you as well.
I thought he would stay here. I didn't think you would just let him wander away.
he didn't wander. He signed out, and I am not a babysitter.
more to the point, david carson is not my baby.
fine.
I'm sure he's okay.
probably just got hungry. - Probably.
or possibly, he's collapsed under the weight of some serious grief.
but what the hell
I'm just a warm-hearted psychologist who loves children.
it's not like I'm a psychiatrist.
good night.
Oh, you're here. - Wouldn't miss it.
wo you know, that was such a bad connection today,
I have a feeling you didn't hear me say...
we need a vase for these babies.
that my mother is here, in this house, and I have had a complete failure of nerve and have not told her we're separated.
you know why you didn't tell her?
because you don't want it to be so.
Oh, no, I don't think -- I don't think that's why I didn't
you know that.
it's just, it's crossed my mind that we were hasty.
I mean, I don't blame you.
but the truth is -- I will always love you.
and another truth is donna is not a nice person.
no kidding.
whoever called her a bleached-blond emotional vacuum, that woman was a fine judge of character.
I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger rosalind's in fine form.
Yes, yes.
look...I know we have legal stuff, emotional stuff, a whole pile of stuff in the attic to plow through, but could you please just help me tonight?
let's break the news together, so she's not too freaked out.
I'll tell her we're separated, but that it's very friendly.
it's no one's fault, we still care about each other, and there are no villains in this story.
it is no one's fault and we still do care about each other and there are no villains in this story.

so, how are the worried well? Any good stories?
Oh, no. Not really.

I know. I'm sorry. I really am.
I know this is not what you want for me.
I know you believe in marriage.
Oh, really, anne! Of course I believe in marriage, whatever that means.
I also believe in good posture, but not everyone has it.
I was "my godding" because you never told me.
you never said, "mother, I'm in pain," or "mother, could you
damn it. I need a cigarette.
Phil, my dear, anne has finally told me.
and I am so, so sorry.
but now you really must go home.
I'm sorry? - You can take the brussels sprouts with you.
but anne and i have to talk, and I have a very early flight tomorrow.
you're throwing me out?
no, of course not. - You could say that, yes. Good night, dear.
I'm sorry.
it breaks my heart to see your mother so upset.
I'm sorry. She's just -- she's just being herself.
thanks for coming.
we haven't finished the "anne and phil" part of the story.
we have.

we didn't have hip-hop. We didn't even have cable.

well, I didn't mean to worry you.
it's not that I want to die, with all the blood and the ambulance and all that drama.

they don't give you what you need.
because I'm not good at anything I do, and I don't play sports.
no, because they can'T.
they don't have it to give.
they are...
limited.
perhaps I shouldn't say this.
perhaps I should say they're doing their best and it's up to you to appreciate it, but I don'think so.
I think it's up to you to survive them...
and become the man you wish to be.
they really let you say this stuff to kids?
sometimes.

I'm sorry, dr. Bellowes.
I just -- I'm gonna wear the dress.
my mother's been crying all night. My dad just took her out for a little while.
I mean, my mother always cries. I can live with that.
but my dad -- it's just killing him.
I mean, my dad is the kind of person who always does the right thing, you know?
he's a stand-up guy.
he says that's what being a man is -- a stand-up guy.
so I'm just gonna wear the damn dress and lie to the whole world.
take a few deep breaths, think about what matters most to you, weigh those different things, and whatever you do will be the right thing.
I hope so.
thank you.
darling?
stand-up guy" -- I like that.
I'll dry, mother.
Hello?
at last. Mr. Carson, this is dr. Kalid.
I don't wish to frighten you.
this is no emergency per se, but I have become friends with your son, david.
with david? No kidding.
so, david is here with me, listening to our conversation, and we have decided that he would be better off in a hospital because of his depression.
what? What depression?
full clinical depression, believe me.
so, the gist of this is this
we're en route to elm psychiatric institute and david will spend a few days there.
you and mrs. Carson need to come home right now, spend some time with him, and have some family therapy.
now?
we've got another four days here.
we're on vacation.
Mr. Carson, your son needs you!
you need to come back now.
are you sure? It sounds like you got everything under control.
elm psychiatric institute tomorrow! Tomorrow!
I lost my temper.
I shouldn't have.
I should have been gently persuasive.
I should have been somebody else.
what's the difference?
I know what they're like, and you know what they're like.
dear God, may they suffer...
...as they have made him suffer.
what's that? Arabic? - Yes.
do you speak it? - No.
good.
sons of bitches.
so, why didn't you tell me, somewhere between first inkling and last suitcase?
I don't know, mother.
I guess I just -- I didn't want to disappoint you.
disappoint?
in your whole life, have I ever, for a minute, been disappointed in you?
I think I've become someone who can't stand to be disappointed.
I just -- I can't stand it.
I understand completely.
much better to shield yourself from pain than risk happiness, eh?
no, that's not what I'm saying.
that's clearly exactly what I'm saying.
I know.
people like us
by no means the worst kind of people, by the way
but we cannot bear to be disappointed so we just stop asking, even for the things we really need.
your father once said that I would rather die in the desert than ask for water.
and I think sometimes we actually choose people who can't give us what we need so we know never to ask or expect. You see?
no disappointment at all.
you've done that? - Oh, my god, yes.
how else can we explain husbands two and three?
after all those years of my saying "you can't get pizza in a chinese restaurant," what did I do?
I just sat in a big pile of egg foo yung and I screamed for pizza pie.
but you, my darling daughter, you are going to do so much better than your old mother.
to pizza.
to pizza.
Dr. Kalid.
it's been... - a couple of years, dr. Rosen.
it's good to see you again.
how's your brother? - Harvard fellowship. He's perfect.
well, he was never as bright as you.
didn't have your substance.
you're charming me, dr. Kalid. - I hope so. And it's taj.
we're colleagues now.

I would be forever mourning

and now, folks, let's meet our first contestant, dr. Taj kalid.
I'm not ready.
are you there, doc?
don't be shy, doc.
everyone knows you're hiding something big.
the question is, will our panelists turn you inside out, or are you going home a winner?
let the race begin.
James, you have 10 seconds to heat things up.
you sound like my ex-wife.
Dr. Kalid, you're a psychiatrist.
would this secret have anything to do with gambling in Vegas?
don't be ridiculous
Barry, take a swing.
I detect some anxiety, doc.
would this secret be bigger than a breadbox?
I mean, could you put it in a breadbox?
I mean, could you do it in a breadbox?
I don't understand.
me neither.
Ann, do you have a question for our contestant?
Dr. Kalid, you handsome devil, are you sleeping with someone on this panel?
answer the question, doc.
I can't answer this question.
my wife and kids are watching at home.
Oh, who cares, big daddy?
let's show her how you shake, rattle, and roll.
Oh, hello.
he's got a secret
he's got a secret
are you all right?
what?
Yes, I'm fine.
go back to sleep.
it's all right.
I should go to the office.
we're supposed to meet with dr. Nour this morning.
are you having second thoughts?
if he's not the therapist for our family, then
he's fine.
he speaks fluent Arabic, has two degrees from Yale, has four daughters of his own.
he's honorable, very honorable.
I wasn't questioning his honor.
I just thought, if you're having -- - I'm not.
I have to go to work.
sis.
Kay, hey!
what are you doing here?
Hi, pretty. I hope you don't mind.
Fred said you had a break between sessions.
it's a great surprise.
when did you get into town?
is bob with you?
Ah, let's see, an hour ago, and bob's at home with the boys.
Oh, god, I still have ringing in my left ear from the flight.
I think I must have inherited dad's ear issues.
Yeah, selective hearing. Who can blame him?
so, what are you doing here?
neurological sciences academic development awards.
it's sort of like our Oscars but without the Botox.
right. Nice.
and you're staying with me?
no.
UH...WE'RE staying at a hotel.
uh...the other doctors at the conference who are attending...it.
Oh, god. I'm still a little brain-dead from the flight.
you have got people wanting to come in and vent, and I am practically deaf.
ly can we just have dinner tonight?
Yeah, I'll come to the hotel.
no, I'd rather go to you.
we can just do the homestyle thing.
we'll do Indian. Kay, what's going on?
Hi.
Oh, hello, Mr. Snow.
please come in. I'll be right with you.
Hey, what's going on? You seem so
nothing, Annie. Everything's fine, really. Everything's fine.
I'll see you around 7: 00.
and if bob calls, could you just tell him I'm staying at your house? Thanks.
have you seen this wee rascal before?
because he does brilliant backflips if you put him on a good surface.
right.
does have a tendency to buckle under pressure.
but, hey, don't we all?
did your mom and dad tell you that it was your schoolteacher, Mrs. Attanas, who suggested you come here?
she says that you haven't used your voice for...about two months.
she really misses hearing it. Do you?
now, those -- those are some of my closest friends.
do you want to meet them?
this guy here -- let me tell you about him.
now, he is monsieur lemitts.
I found him in a flea market in Paris.
he has always got something to say.
Bonjour, Aaron.
see what I mean?
do you want to see me do a backflip?
sing a song?
fart on command?
so, you do have the teeth.
you've been through a lot.
and I've never lost a big brother, but I do know what it's like to have a person there one day and gone the next.
some kids find this place a good place to talk.
and what you say in here -
well, it doesn't go beyond you, me...
and monsieur lemitts.
you must be the kalids.
welcome.
welcome.
I'm dr. Nour.
nice to meet you.
this is my wife, meena.
pleasure.
and jhasmine.
what a lovely family you have. Come.
come into my cave.
I'll meet you back here at 11: 00.
whoa, whoa, whoa, habibi. Where are you going?
aren't you the head of this family?
I-I can't read the body without the head.
Oh, please tell me that's not a blueberry bagel.
is that a problem?
you tell me. Is cream cheese on your sushi a problem?
how about pineapple on your pizza?
I just like blueberries in my bagel.
well, then, eat a muffin.
don't tamper with something that took centuries to perfect in the rustic ovens of eastern europe.
there were no blueberries in krakow.
Hello, guys.
good morning.
you know -- hold on.
Oh, what does he want?
Hi, phil. What's up?
can I put soy milk in my coffee, or is your head gonna explode?
what time?
no, I'm not peeved.
it's just last time you swung by, you stole all my furniture.
I told her to change the locks.
no later than 7: 30 because my sister's coming for dinner.
no, it's okay. Just bring them by. I'll sign them.
okay.
what's up?
he's bringing by the divorce papers for me to sign.
he doesn't have to be there. If he's being combative
Oh, you know, he's actually being...
you don't think it's possible for a couple to part amicably?
people do it every day.
not in my office, by and large, but it does happen.
as your legal counsel, I would advise caution.
you get sucked in by sweet talk, and the next thing you know, phil has walked off with your patio furniture.
I don't have a patio.
but I do have a new couch.
hide it.
my goodness.
are your family meals this quiet?
I'm only asking because, at my house, you have to fight to get a word in.
my wife always says,"in the next life, more soup, less children."
whatever that means.
Oh, come on, folks, you didn't come all this way to dent my pillows.
why are we here?
we think we might have a problem.
jhasmine is -- she was worried about her weight, and now she hardly eats at all.
that's why we're here?
I thought you said it was a family problem.
Yeah, I - - meena, please.
my wife is a wonderful mother, but she worries, like every mother.
every scratch is an open wound, every headache a brain tumor.
she's not a medical professional, but she fears
I eat plenty. I eat all the time.
I guess I have my dad's metabolism, not my mom's.
that's not a problem. That's a gift.
Jhasmine, let me finish.
if you don't mind, I'd really like to hear from azita.
Why?
why not? Do you think your sister has an eating disorder?
I never said that.
you haven't said anything yet.
half the girls in my school lick the salt off a pretzel and then throw it out.
don't exaggerate, azita, please.
okay. Yes.
she's starving herself.
she thought she was getting fat, so now she locks herself in the bathroom after every meal and hurls.
she's been doing it for months.
and you act like she's in there trying on lip gloss.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, jhas. They asked.
Taj, meena, has...anything else changed in your household in the last six months?
what are you asking?
what are you not telling?
if we believe what azita is saying -
and you seem to think we should -
we can now address the problem, and we will.
thank you, dr. Nour.
you've been most helpful. Girls?
uh, dr. Kalid, I think that your wife would like to finish the session.
we will...at home. Meena?
it's okay.
we'll see you later.
I don't think so, but thank you.
suit yourself.
I'll see you next time jhasmine throws up.
so long, girls.
his academic performance hasn't suffered, not that that's the most important thing.
well, he's a bright kid, independent.
really pretty well-adjusted.
but you wouldn't be here if you weren't also concerned that he stopped speaking.
we're assuming he's still in shock about his brother's death.
and he'll talk again when he's ready.
he's doing the best he can.
there's only so much a 10-year-old can take in about a hit-and-run, you know.
well, do you remember the last thing that aaron said?
did he use words to express anger or sadness?
honestly, the whole period, the funeral...
it's all just kind of a blur.
you ow?
well, we did make some headway today in our first session.
he seemed to respond well to me and the puppet, so
good. We'll bring him back.
same time tomorrow, then?
uh, sure.
Thanks.
thank you.
Bye.
Hey. - Hi.
something smells good. - Yeah.
that would be dinner.
Kay wanted takeout.
are those the divorce papers?
that box is huge.
well, the papers are on top, but I also -- I brought back this.
I picked it up the last time I was here without really looking through it, and I shouldn't have grabbed it.
it's pictures from vermont at your cousin karina's wedding, lots of shots of your family.
Bob's hand on kay's ass.
Oh, my god. Look at my hair.
why did you let me leave the house like that?
it was sexy.
who's that?
Kay. - Right.
I, um -- I should go.
Hey, you can at least say hello.
Hey. - Hi.
we're here.
and I hope this goes with whatever you're serving.
Hi. - Hey.
hello.
Oh, ann, this is adam.
Kay's told me so much about you.
I didn't know phil would be joining us.
I didn't know adam was joining us.
I'm out of here, actually. It was great seeing you. - You too.
Kay, you look luminous.
it was nice meeting you.
enjoy dinner. - Thanks.
Oh, kay, my love to bob.
what the hell is going on? - What?
you bring your lover here?
lover? Please.
a lover is a 25-year-old wearing a lot of hair product.
I am not lady chatterley, and adam isn't the gardener.
we met when I - - I don't care how you met.
I don't care how we met, either.
he is not a passing fancy.
he is not a hot flash.
and, as embarrassing as it is to say this, I think he's the love of my life.
what about bob?
remember bob, the man you've been married to for 22 years?
I know.
I do love bob.
and I can't bear to hurt him any more than I have, and...
I haven't told him yet.
Oh, is that my job, too?
Ann, my god, just put me on the rack.
I came to you because I
to get my permission to leave your husband?
Oh, ann...
okay, what? I get it, okay?
this guy makes your pulse race.
and what is bob?
old bob mows the lawn?
old bob just mows the lawn?
his allergies are worse than yours.
Adam listens, and he hears me.
in the six months we've been seeing each other, he has seen a lot of me.
I bet he has.
not in that way.
he really...sees me.
Bob - - bob is a good man.
Bob knows you. He puts up with you.
you don't walk out on a man like bob.
I married phil because I thought he was bob.
Yeah, well, I married bob because I thought he was dad.
why would you marry dad?
you know what? Don't even tell me.
I'd have to charge us both for this session.
I just want you to get to know him.
he's a nice man.
I'm sure he's a nice man, but you have a nice man.
you don't need two.
so, you get to leave phil, but I can't leave bob?
you didn't leave phil because you caught him cheating with that blond bombshell.
you left him because you didn't want to be married to him.
Adam and I will have dinner at the hotel.
if bob calls, I'm not lying for you.
I'm not gonna get pulled into this.
ahoy, james. This is aaron.
ahoy, matey.
last time danny and me talked, he said he was sending me a package from school, but I never got it. And I know he sent it.
he always said what he meant and meant what he said.
I'm sure he did.
let's chat about this tomorrow.
don't think so.
mom and dad said that I'm not coming back.
say hi to monsieur lemitts for me.
you always were judgmental, darling, and bossy, from the day you were born.
if you'd had the words, you would have told me how to give birth to you.
Oh, don't bother.
indian bread doesn't keep. By tomorrow, that's a coaster.
not that I'm any expert on matrimony, but
well, yes, I am, if volume counts.
Oh, sweetheart, how can you be so self-righteous?
what about you and Mr. Rhythm and blues?
whatever happened to him, by the way?
did you scare him off?
it wasn't all bad.
of course not. It was tedious.
never did understand how memory can turn years of boredom into marital bliss.
we had fun.
it was just the last 45 minutes sucked.
Hello, bob.
Yeah, um...j-just, uh, cleaning up.
you know, she fell asleep.
I think the trip -- it took it out of her.
do you want me to leave her a message?
your dinner's in the fridge.
So...can I ask you a question?
of course. You can ask me anything.
was that therapy session supposed to make things better?
cause mommy's upstairs crying, and jhasmine's online, searching for a weapon to kill me.
let's not jump to any conclusions about your mother...
or your sister.
in medicine, we don't diagnose until we have all the information.
you still think jhasmine's losing weight because she has your speedy metabolism?
azita, please!
how much more information do you need?
does she need to throw up on the table?
where is your sister?
we ate an hour ago, so...
I'm guessing she's in the bathroom.
Hello?
Mrs. Pfeiffer, this is james lecroix.
sorry to call so late.
is something wrong?
no, no. Not at all.
I was just wondering whether you and your husband can maybe come by tomorrow a few minutes earlier so we could chat before aaron's session.
Actually...we were gonna call you in the morning.
I don't think aaron wants to -
he doesn't seem to want to come back.
Really?
Why's that?
maybe this whole situation was a little too stressful for him.
we know the school wants aaron to see you, but maybe this isn't the best -
who's on the phone?
I-I'm not saying we might not want to give it another try in the future.
right now it's a little more than he can handle.
that's very interesting.
did aaron say so? Did he speak?
tell him we'll call him.
you know, this isn't a good time.
let me call you next week.
just one more second, please, Mrs. Pfeiffer.
do you know if danny sent a package to aaron from the school before the accident?
a package from school?
no, we have all of danny's things.
there's no package.
perhaps your husba- - there's no package.
and I really do have to go. Good night.
baba, did you just get home?
I've been here for a while.
I just wanted to make sure you weren't too upset about this morning.
I think dr. Nour -- I mean...
he is a bit of an oddball.
but I think he's all right.
do you think he figured out that azita's just a drama queen that makes things up because she has no life?
you should not be angry.
Oh, of course not.
why should anyone get angry with azita, little miss perfect?
and I'm just the family embarrassment.
you really think that's how we feel?
can we talk later?
sorry. I didn't wake you, did I?
no.
I figured you and kay would still be up trading war stories about your mom.
no, kay left. What is this?
it's more pictures.
Jamaica.
you got that horrible sunburn. I couldn't touch you for a week.
Oh, yes. I remember. Yes.
so, does donna know you're coming out in the middle of the night?
well, it's 10: 15, and donna wouldn't know or care.
I told you, I haven't seen her for weeks. It's over.
you want to open the wine kay brought?
Oh, why not?
how did it go with kay? Who was ranger rick?
Yes, dr. Adam silver -
Mr. Lasik eye surgery and the love of her life.
you're kidding me.
she's leaving bob?
not yet, but she's working on it.
I can't believe she'd do that to bob.
he's such a nice guy. - I know.
but, apparently, it's not enough.
why not?
Oh, I don't know.
I'm just -- I'm so frustrated with her.
you don't throw away all that history because some attractive stranger finds you fascinating.
Bob's in better shape.
I don't think she's faced how terrible it's gonna be when she leaves him, even if it's the right thing to do.
and especially if it's not.
pretend I didn't speak. Glasses.
Yes, I'll get a couple.
I think we should see dr. Nour again.
I know jhasmine needs to see someone.
but I don't think dr. Nour - - I liked him.
I'll call him today.
I'm not sure jhasmine is comfortable with him.
well, she trusts you.
I'm sure you'll get her to come.
now, I was gonna squeeze fresh juice, but all you've got is a mango.
m and I don't know how to squeeze a mango.
well, you peel it -
I thought so, but it seemed like an awful lot of work, and all the juice ends up on your hands.
you okay?
Yeah. Yep. Yeah.
just waking up, and, uh...
Yeah, finding you here.
I know. I know. It's, uh...
it's like I never left.
not really.
no.
it's better than I never left. It's...
I was an idiot, I left...
and I learned a few things.
and now I'm here. And last night was great.
Phil. - Don't say it. I know.
I'm gonna be out of here in five minutes, and you can just pretend I was a very horny U. P.S. Man making a midnight delivery.
Oh, phil, I think we need to talk.
Absolutely.
if you're free, I'd love to have dinner tonight.
sweetie, we're one signature away from being divorced.
I don't think we should be dating.
I am talking about a friendly dinner.
a couple of steaks, a red sox game on tv...
friends, people who care about each other.
and, hey, I'll pick up the steaks.
you know, what you told kay was good advice. I mean it.
you act rashly, you can really miss out, end up...
losing something you can't replace. My collar sticking up?
no, no. It looks nice.
well, my last patient's at 7: 00.
what time does the game start?
excuse me. Do you happen to know which room was danny pfeiffer's?
looking for somebody?
not someone, per se.
more of a -- was this danny pfeiffer's room?
who are you?
I'm james lecroix.
I'm a nobody. Well, a friend.
more a professional contact of danny's family.
if you've got questions, you should'valk to the headmaster.
Yeah, I tried, but without much success.
Yeah, well, he's not a real people person.
I'm not sure he's a person at all.
had the kind of face you could strap to the front of a truck and use to clear snow.
were you here during the spring break when the accident happened?
like I said, if you want the official story
I don't.
I want to hear it from someone who really knew danny.
I know his little brother aaron, and he's taking it very hard.
look, the school has to make up stuff 'cause they're scared of getting their asses sued.
they say there's all this supervision over the break. There was no one.
if someone had been here, maybe they could have talked him off that ledge.
Danny wasn't hit by a car.
I got to go.
did he jump?
I couldn't have stopped him, okay?
even if I had been here.
he was depressed from the day he got here.
I've got to go.
it's all right.
I just need to know, did danny leave a package behind addressed to his brother?
you might not know.
I... I do know.
um... he mailed it...
the night before he...
I was with him when he dropped it off.
do you know what was in it?
no.
no, his little brother was the only person he could talk to.
life sucks.
Hi, kay, it's me, the high priestess of good behavior.
I'm really sorry about last night.
please don't leave town without calling me, okay?
and I-I will listen. I promise.
I love you.
so, I'm thinking of calling the pfeiffers.
and telling them what?
that I've heard about the cover-up.
from a 15-year-old boy at a school you had business going to.
Yeah, but I went.
Yes, you did.
you trespassed, you interrogated a minor you had no right to speak to, and now you want to top it off by calling this dead kid's parents and telling them that you heard their son killed himself.
you always do this.
the children are innocent victims, the parents are monsters, and you're the catcher in the rye.
Yes, I know, but the parents are hiding something.
I'm right about this.
maybe. But what if you're not?
and what about the little boy?
you really want my advice?
leave these people alone.
no one has hired you, and no one is gonna thank you for this.
if you kalids don't start talking,
I will be forced to tell you about my emergency appendectomy.
and show you my scar. - Ew
I know.
start talking.
why me?
you think I'm the only person in this family hiding things?
sweetie, dr. Nour is only trying to help.
then let him help you.
I'm not the one who jumps in the shower when I come home every night to wash off someone's perfume.
what are you talking about?
teenagers have active imaginations.
they do.
and they also have keen powers of observation.
Jhasmine, you sound very angry with your father.
I'm not.
it's not even his fault.
my mother puts up with it.
she lets him. - That's enough.
I don't think so.
but if it is too much for you, we'll understand if you want to leave.
go on.
what would you like your mother to say?
anything.
she knows what he's doing, and she doesn't do anything about it.
God forbid she tell him to cut it out, or else.
she acts like we're living in cairo.
apologize to your mother now.
Why?
the only thing that I'm sorry about is I was born into some stupid tradition ti where the wife's expected to stay home and cook and accept whatever crap her husband dumps on her.
stop!
that's who I'm supposed to be when I grow up?
kill me now.
you should show more respect for your mother.
I can't believe you can even say those words.
we agree aaron should see a professional, and we're glad that you're so interested in him, but we feel that forcing this right now -
actually, I'm here to see you two.
look, this is rather awkward, and I know that we don't know each other very well, and me barging in here, well -
can we sit down?
we're on our way out.
aaron's upstairs changing.
this is about danny.
what about him?
I don't think that he was the victim of an accident.
I went to his school and happened to bump into one of his chums and
what?
who did you speak to? - Please.
aren't we allowed to let him rest in peace?
Danny was a good boy, he was a happy boy, and what happened was an accident!
why did you go?
who asked you?
we need you to leave this alone.
my wife has suffered enough.
none of it brings him back.
you can go now, please.
what about aaron?
do you know what a burden it is growing up knowing that your older brother killed himself?
he does not need to think that his brother was some sad, sick -
I don't think anything will make him think that.
but aaron's not speaking because he doesn't see the point if nobody is telling the truth.
will you please ask him to leave?
I'm going.
but if that package that danny mentioned does exist, please, give it to aaron.
his brother killed himself.
it's a tragedy.
but it's not a scandal.
Hey.
hope you don't mind, kiddo.
I booked your next hour.
you should know, though, I have really lousy insurance.
fortunately, I don't have any problems.
did you get my messages?
Yeah.
thank you.
Adam and I had a big blowout last night.
our first fight.
I'm sorry.
I'm sure it wasn't much help that I was so welcoming.
no.
but you were totally right.
I don't know what I thought
that my happiness trumped everyone else's?
I got to burn down the house just because my heart had found a home?
Kay, if it's not right for you and bob, please, don't let me rain on your parade.
my god.
I just wish what was best for me was best for them.
I am my truest, happiest self with adam.
and it doesn't matter.
I'm not gonna do that to my kids.
they'd be devastated.
for a while.
but ultimately, they want a mom who's living a whole life, not a half life.
and being with someone because you're supposed to is just as damaging, for everyone.
no.
as you know perfectly well.
my half life would do just fine for everybody for another 5 or 10 years.
I don't want you living a half life.
and I'm glad you met someone you love that you're crazy about.
I mean, the timing is very, very bad, but I wouldn't want you not to have it.
very nice
I hope kay can steel herself to do the brave and terrifying thing.
and, annie...
you're next.
martini?
please.
can I interrupt?
Yes.
I can't...
we can't see each other anymore...
the way we have been.
My...family needs my full attention.
of course.
I understand.
I just want to say I'M...
I know this goes without saying.
I know we'll remain cordial.
I just don't want this to make things awkward at work, for either of us.
of course not.
I hope things work out for you at home.
right now, I have a dinner date.
I won't keep you.
the package.
did your parents give you this?
how did you get it?
you found where it was hidden, didn't you?
that's brilliant!
don't you want to see what's inside?
well, look, aaron, if there's something in here that scares you, well, we will face it together.
with monsieur lemitts.
cause he doesn't scare easily.
Hey, there.
Hi, phil.
how was your day?
I'm sensing a little stress.
Oh, A little, yeah.
let me get rid of that for you.
T. G.I. F.Hmm?
uh...I don't know, but
Ow! Ow! Stop! Stop!
Why? - I'm on a fork!
can we just talk, please?
we spent our whole marriage talking.
we need to just feel things right here on this table.
and on the rug.
don't fight it.
passion's good.
no, passion's great, but this is like "magritte's kiss."
I love that statue.
no, no, no, no, no.
no, no, no.
what?
you're -- you're thinking rodin.
in the painting, the people have white bags over their heads.
they can't see a thing.
Wow. What just happened?
nothing.
exactly what was supposed to happen.
this isn't exactly what I rushed home for.
I know. I know. I know.
really, you came to get my signature, and -
and now we need to get unsidetracked and sign those papers.
you don't have to open it if you don't want to, aaron.
what you have to say to your brother...
might be more important than what danny has to say to you.
so you just say it...
if you wish.
I miss him.
I miss him a lot.
well, we're all ears.
tell us about danny.
I just miss him.
it's strange not having him around, you know?
he made everything better.
and everything was okay.
even if it wasn't, it was still okay 'cause we were a team.
if he heard a new song he loved, he'd always record it for me.
I listened to all those songs.
we did lots of stuff together, stupid stuff.
but it made us laugh.
we really laughed a lot.
when he left home, something changed.
he got...sad.
we e-mailed a lot, but it wasn't the same, and he hardly came home.
whenever I got really scared of doing something, like...
the first time I went underwater, danny used to say...
we can do anything, dude. We're the pfeiffer brothers.
like they were from another planet.
I couldn't keep my eyes away.
when I was little my mom took me to watch a jam session in the neighborhood.
it started out small, but word spread.
soon, some of the best dancers around were showing up
to compete in something they eventually called, "the streets."
it became the hub, and I got a front row seat to history.
I wanted to glide and spin and fly like they did.
but it didn't come easy.
my mom would tell me, "don't give up, just be you,
cause life's too short to be anybody else."
she was right.
when I was 16 my mom got sick.
within a couple of months, she was gone.
and everything changed...
...including the streets.
get down
suspects jammed it.
they went up the stairs. - sir, are you ok?
yo, the four-one-oh killed it again, man.
that was sick, son.
thank you very much. I'm a genius.
if you do say so yourself. girl, get out of here.
get that mask off.
yo, we gonna get some serious youtube play, son.
come on, let's go. we gotta get to the spot before everybody gets there.
Oh, man, we struck gold with this. look at that,
this is off the chain.
boards are gonna go crazy over this one.
yo, let's upload this stat. not it. - not it.
Aye. why it gotta be me?
cause you're the youngest.
and, obviously, the slowest.
girl, stop slinging that spanish at me, telemundo.
gotcha. - oh, jesus, tuck!
Oh, man, wish you could see the look on your faces.
can the jokes, son. - so what did you guys think?
on the real?
we killed that!
Oh, yes!
lucky, lucky!
streets ain't gonna be ready for us this year.
finally. - let me see that. let me see that.
give us my camera back. give me here.
go, go, go, go.
so what's up? we going out tonight?
I don't know. it's just...
it's been a crazy time, at home with sarah and all.
Yeah, I heard that before. - yo, tuck!
come on, man, we bouncing.
we gotta go. you're lagging. - all right.
I'll see you at rehearsal. - ok.
this video, posted on the internet just hours ago was taken earlier today.
depicts the most recent in a wave of public disturbances
plaguing the streets of baltimore.
the notoriously elusive four-one-oh
has claimed responsibility for this morning's attack
that both defaced public property and shut down
the charles center station over security concerns.
police have been tracking this troubling trend,
and sources close to the investigation...
not so fast, andie. get in here. - andie!
we've got to talk. I can't believe you.
dinner was an hour ago.
sorry, sarah, bus was late.
I'm here, so just chill out.
baby, you go on upstairs and go to bed.
OK.
I know where you been. it's all over the news.
so don't stand here and lie to my face.
you realize you could have been arrested?
it wasn't a big deal.
you have no idea what you're talking about.
you've got to take responsibility for your life.
you can't follow the four-one-oh forever.
those people are criminals.
I'm putting my foot down.
this has got to stop. now.
No! no, the four-one-oh is the only family I have left.
who are you to tell me how to live my life?
your mother was my best friend!
I told her that I would be your guardian.
I promised her that I would take care of you
so you wouldn't have to leave your life here.
but you won't let me.
instead, you skip school. you're out all night.
God only knows what you're doing.
I can't do this.
your aunt alice and I have been talking.
you can't live here anymore.
you're sending me to texas?
like I haven't lost enough already?
you can't do this to me!
your mother never would've let you get away with half the things I have.
no, you have no idea what my mother would have done.
Felicia, where are you?
I don't know what to do. I'm going crazy.
I'm done with her. please, I need a place to crash.
I'm not staying there anymore. call me.
I'm heading to the dragon.
what's popping? I'm the man, dj sand.
tonight it's all about the benjamins, baby.
we taking it to the streets for green.
you got money? no, you don't.
we gonna get it started.
brand new music. listen to this one.
yo, meazy. what's going on?
yo, d. what it is. - how are ya?
you out to do some damage tonight?
you want to take my bag?
Yes, yes, got it, got it. it's crazy out there.
I know. it is. - about to do your thing?
Oh, I will. you know. - go school them fools.
look who's all grown up now.
ty, what are you doing? oh, my god.
what's up, little one? - oh. I thought you were - in new york with nora. - I am.
I came back to get the rest of my stuff.
guess what. - what?
me and nora are going on tour. - what?
Oh, that is unreal. you better remember me when you get all famous and stuff.
are you kidding me? I remember you when you were running around in diapers.
you were a pain in my ass.
that's really embarrassing.
seriously, what's going on with you and sarah?
she called you. - no, she didn't call me.
I came by to see you, and she told me you took off.
she's flipping out.
did she tell you she's sending me away?
she don't know what else to do with you.
she's trying to look out for you,
like your mom and everyone else looked out for me.
so, you're siding with her. - no, I'm not.
I don't even need to explain this. I'm out.
whoa, whoa, come on. chill out.
maybe you'll realize there are some less dramatic options.
really, like what?
msa. - ok.
maryland school of the arts.
Yeah, I know what it is.
are you crazy?
do I look like some princess prima ballerina?
Andie, what other options do you have? hmm?
let me break it down for you.
Sarah will give you one more shot.
but msa's no joke.
you gotta go to class, you can't skip school, you got to study.
no chance, no way.
OK, fine, I'll battle you for it. right now.
you win, I never saw you here tonight.
I win, you get your ass back home and you're at msa First thing in the morning.
if you're scared, say you're scared.
I wouldn't want to battle me if I was a girl.
no smile?
what, you scared? you down?
hold it, hold it. hold up, hold it.
we got royalty in the house.
Tyler gage is in the building.
Oh, man.
you know we gotta do something special, right?
clear the dance floor. back up!
brand new music.
Oh, man, are those trampolines?
use them or lose them. here we go. cool, you all.
Dre, you want to get this? I'll break my neck.
no, I got it.
is she talking crazy?
you still dance like a little girl?
let her know what's good, tyler.
come on, I want to show you.
Oh, wow! he's killing you!
she punched it on you. whatcha gonna do?
did she stick you? she stuck it on you.
what you gonna do? he's not...
Oh, no! he's coming out of his clothes!
it's over. it's over.
come on, you all. it's all good, andie.
next time, baby.
it's all right. you're good, ma.
don't sweat it.
everybody's hating on you 'cause you're dope.
are you running off again?
no. - no?
I'm just trying to look out for you.
Yeah, whatever
Yeah, whatever. don't give me "whatever."
let's get you out of here. I've got to get you home,
plus we've got to sell sarah on the idea.
I thought she agreed.
just let me do the talking.
no. I'm sending her to texas, that's final.
she's already on probation at school.
this is the one shot she needs to take all that anger she's got
and be able to put it into a structure.
she's not going to school now.
what makes you think she's gonna go to this school?
piece of cake. - no way.
that's the thanks for saving your ass?
she's down?
believe it or not, she thinks I set a good example for you.
what? - I don't know.
my work here is done. I'm going home.
now, all you have to do is get in.
I thought you said you took care of everything.
I didn't say I'd get you in.
I said I'd get you an audition.
so, go show them what you got, all right?
go hard, make me proud. promise?
promise. - ok.
stay out of trouble, all right?
holy hell. I cannot believe you're about to do this.
well, it is this or texas, so... take your pick.
don't blow it. no pressure or anything, girl.
wait a minute. - check that out.
it can't be that bad, going here.
she's hot. - missy, shut up.
what? - just stop talking.
I guess. - look, go in there and kill it.
we'll see you at rehearsal afterwards.
come on, missy. - good luck, d. later.
he was cute.
you're mad cause he wasn't looking at you.
he wasn't looking at you or your chapped lips.
boring. it's a bunch of clones.
just because they do turns with their feet and not on their heads?
very funny. wake me up when they're all done.
I think we'd all agree that talent comes from mastering technique.
I was brought here because I can turn amateurs into professionals nailed it.
music, please.
thank you. - do you have your paperwork?
Yep.
Hi. - hi.
thank you, miss, uh... west.
Mm-hmm. - well.
well, she was different.
kidding? that was the best dance today.
the girl's amazing.
she's just a street dancer.
Blake, I thought you could turn anyone into a professional.
hold that.
so what happened?
you guys, I choked. - what do you mean?
I tried to get it back but I just freaked out.
Sarah gonna have her in texas before we know it.
Hello? - yo? who you talking to?
Oh, here he comes.
I gotta take this real quick.
man, what you all doing? come on.
how'd she mess up? - I hope she didn't.
looks like I'm staying.
you are! - goodness, girl.
I knew you would. how were you not gonna make it?
yo, we need a family meeting.
yo, we got this gig at the dragon coming up,
and we're not even close to being ready.
the four-one-oh is a unit.
we're only as strong as our weakest link.
with the way
our new members are slacking, we have to step it up.
which means, rehearsal every day, 4: 00 p. m.
no excuses, no being late, and no cell phones.
are we clear?
crystal. - we're clear.
we all want the same thing
you're in my seat.
I'm kidding.
this is my seat, but I'll give you a pass for today.
nice. nice. nice shirt, napoleon dynamite. nice.
you look fantastic today, by the way. nice hair.
what's up?
I'm robert alexander, you can call me moose.
what's up. I'm andie.
it's like this. give me your hand.
you got to blow it up. right. blow it up.
go by like that. aye! yeah?
it's mine, so... shh.
you're not eating? - you call this food?
tofu dogs are both nutritious and delicious.
this is good.
tastes like candy canes at christmas '
what? - you've got crap on your face.
Oh. I knew we could help each other out.
Oh, what makes you think I need help?
what makes you think I need...
trust me. I have what you need.
I have the inside on everything.
who's dating, who's hating.
and who's hooking up.
what's up, dan? what's up, gator?
who's that? - see you guys later.
that's the music room. this is the art room
where some of the greatest baltimore artists...
I'm dead serious.
sorry.
you ok?
thank you.
we gotta stop meeting like this, you know.
it's andie, right?
I'm chase. welcome to msa. I'm glad you made it in.
well, here I am.
you're an amazing little dancer.
what? - you're an amazing little dancer.
little? really?
well, you know, I wouldn't call my dancing "little."
I definitely was not trying to say... - andie!
where have you been? I've been looking for you.
chase. - hey.
how you doing? - great. you guys are friends?
Yeah, we go way back. - good.
we're actually late for a little something, so...
we are?
Yeah. - what?
remember that thing you told me?
I didn't tell you anything.
Yes, you did. we're gonna go.
remember that thing? - what?
that thing you wanted to do? - what are you talking about?
I can't believe you know chase collins.
that's extremely vital information to withhold.
I don't know him. - he's mr. popular.
like a legacy. his parents, like, founded this school.
and his brother is legendary.
Dr. collins is his brother? - yeah.
he used to go here, then moved to london to dance with the royal ballet.
Oh, my god. that's him?
Yeah. it's hard to believe, right, with all those feathers.
so why'd he come back?
good question.
sources say he has some sweet deal to make msa the next juilliard.
which he's been trying to do. maybe he's just burned out.
one thing's for sure.
there's a lot of changes going down that nobody likes.
here.
anyway, the collins are like flippin' msa royalty.
chase, he's a ladies' man.
he's a player? - like an all-star.
he's only recently taken the jersey out of retirement. so be warned.
Oh, and that's cyborg sophie.
she's an msa machine and collins' crowning achievement.
she's a triple threat. she acts, sings and dances.
she won every competition out there.
but she just lost the biggest battle of them all,
the one for chase's heart.
it's like I've landed in an episode of the hills.
he broke up with her a few weeks ago, but they'll end up together.
just in time for the season finale, huh?
see? I knew you'd come around.
Hello, everyone. I'm director collins.
I hope you've all stretched this morning,
cause we have a lot of work to do today.
I'm sure that everyone has heard of our plans
to move msa into a new state-of-the-art facility.
well, to encourage the donors, we're throwing a fundraiser,
where you will perform
to demonstrate what a good investment you are.
it should be a wonderful event.
you are all required to participate in one way or another.
so, let's begin with some impromptu, shall we?
Jimmy, you're up.
you're late. not being on time won't fly in the real world.
already with that stuff, blake?
that's director collins. - yes, your majesty.
chase, show us what you got.
good. Not great. could do better.
OK. andie, you're up.
are you serious?
listen and interpret.
Andie. andie! you're all over the place.
again, from the top, listen and interpret.
stop. stop! can I have a word with you in private?
and bring your bags.
do you understand you've been given an opportunity
that others couldn't even dream of?
I put my name on the line for you,
and I'm beginning to wonder if I made a mistake.
you clearly have some catching up to do.
starting tomorrow I'm assigning you to attend after school sessions with me.
well, I can't. I gotta be somewhere.
consider this an opportunity.
what?
made a mistake and kissed a snake
how many doctors did it take?
one, two, three, four
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten
just breathe. first day's always the worst.
I was just... - that's ok.
I come out to the front steps and meditate, too.
what? it's not meditating.
it's just, you know,
you had some pretty serious balls today in class.
I was impressed. - oh, gee, thanks.
you're welcome. - so what's your deal?
boy bands making a comeback?
Yeah. they have a course on it here.
I'm getting straight a's.
that wouldn't surprise me.
look, it's been interesting bonding with you, but I'm late.
late for what? - just this rehearsal thing.
rehearsal for what? - rehearsal with some friends.
like a crew? - what would you know about that?
knew it. saw you at the dragon. you're with four-one-oh.
I don't know what... - I've always wanted to compete,
I've just never had an in. can you hook me up?
Hey, chase, we're working on the routine for the fundraiser.
are you coming?
Yeah, I'll be right there.
Sophie, I'll meet you in the rehearsal.
OK.
look.
the streets is about where you're from.
it's not some school talent show.
there's no spring floors. there's no spotlights.
you use what you got and...
what makes you think you got it?
weren't you late for something, andie?
all dressed in yellow
went upstairs to kiss a fella
one, two, three, four
five, six, seven, eight, - bye, andie west. - nine, ten, eleven, twelve, 13, 14, 15, 16...
...five, six, seven, eight. again.
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
one, two, three, four. whoa, wait, oh, wait.
you did that different. can you do that from three four?
let me go figure this out.
you all just chill here for a second.
where have you been? I been texting you all day.
I know, I'm sorry. the school thing is crazy.
will you cover for me with tuck?
don't I always cover for you? yeah.
yo, d, let me holler at you.
yo, where you been?
I had to take care of some stuff.
Yeah, with who? - charlie.
Sarah asked me to take care of him while she was at work.
you still coming over tonight or what?
Yeah, yeah. gonna take care of some stuff and I'll be there.
all right.
yo! start from the beginning.
OK, now, point your toe.
you see, you're sickling.
there should be no curve disrupting the line from the knee
all the way down to the tip of your toe.
there you go. that's it.
there. that's it. - ow. pointing hurts.
Yeah, it's supposed to.
pull in your stomach. flatten, flatten, flatten.
now, tuck your butt.
keep this leg turned out.
turned out. turned out!
Oh, my god.
balance, balance, chasse, pas de bourree,
turn, turn, down, finish.
turn, turn, spot, spot!
ready, and feet in front, feet back,
feet front, feet back. come on.
and back and back and back and back
and back and back and back and back and back and back and back.
good! that's it.
Andie? there's dinner down here.
- yo, where d at?
she left me a message. sarah got her on lockdown again.
guess she's missing out... again.
guess so.
and then I was like, "damn, your breath stinks."
why would you say that?
I thought it would be cool. - well, it wasn't.
it's my mom. - oh, my gosh.
what? - that is not your ringtone.
Why? it's the coolest thing ever.
OK, fine. listen.
here we go. watch me, watch me, watch.
I don't even know him.
you were so sick. I had no idea you could dance.
whatever. - what are you talking about?
why don't you dance here?
I can freestyle all right. right?
but I didn't get in here for dance.
I didn't think I could do choreography.
but now I'm all about lighting design.
the end's not working.
mixing those moves just feels wrong.
come on, man. - let me show you something.
if you put this here into a canon, and then swing through to fifth,
then bring it down. step, step, stag.
Soutenu, double tour to the knee.
nice, jimmy.
looks like someone's in a good mood.
must be hard living in the shadow of a legend, huh?
wow, that coming from the msa charity case?
I was kidding. you're right, he's an ass. I'm out of here.
look, I never called you an ass.
she just said that for dramatic effect.
if you're trying to win her over,
you probably shouldn't treat her like that.
I'm not trying to win her over.
then don't lead her on.
Andie.
Hey. - what's going on?
I wanted to apologize for earlier today.
it wasn't anything personal.
I had a really rough day and I was joking.
Oh, please. it's not like I sit up at night
and think about what you do or don't say to me,
but thanks.
I feel better now. - let me give you a ride.
make it up to you.
I can just take the bus.
no, come on. my car's gotta smell better than the bus.
there she is. - she come when we're done.
she missed the whole rehearsal.
Hey, guys.
miss thing girl. where you been at? what's the deal?
thank you for gracing us with your presence.
rehearsal's done. - hey, hey, come on.
I got here as soon as I could. you know what's been going on.
no, I don't, but I'll tell you what's been going on.
everybody's been asking, "have you talked to d? where's d at?"
I'm looking like an ass making stuff up for you,
so you can go dance around your fancy new school.
what is your problem? - what's going on here?
ask her. - what was that?
I said, "ask her."
d, you gotta tell me something?
Yeah, the reason I've been late and haven't been around much
is because...
...l've been going to school at msa.
so you've been lying to me and the crew for what?
those ballet boys? - I don't have a choice.
no, that's messed up, d. we're family.
I thought you said you understood that.
the four-one-oh don't come second to nobody.
you out. - no, please, tuck, come on.
it's just been a crazy time.
it's always been a crazy time with you.
yo, let's go.
Hey, watch yourself, huh?
God...
morning, sunshine.
the good times just keep on coming, don't they?
what got into you today? - what?
as opposed to my winning charm every other day?
fair enough. two points to the new girl.
you want to talk about it?
I got kicked out of my crew. - what for?
for being here.
I can't believe I messed this up.
they're the ones that messed up. they lost an amazing dancer.
you should just start your own crew.
no, you can't just start your own crew.
why not? - because you can't.
besides, who would be in it? me and... - me.
us. - ok. we'll just start our own crew.
what else you gonna do?
nobody here is gonna step out of their perfect world.
not the sophie donovans, but there's a lot going on under the radar.
Really?
there's this guy we call hair.
he's this half hippy, half rhythmic rebel
and he makes the sickest beats.
teachers don't know what to do with him.
can't put him in a class, gets bored, makes up his own steps.
there's kido. she's this foreign exchange student
obsessed with old-school american hip hop.
and, trust me, she doesn't need english to speak our language.
fly's the quiet one, but not when the music's on.
she's too tall to partner, but when you're that good, who needs a partner?
which brings us to monster, our resident stunt double.
he flips, he slides, he falls.
whatever you need to make an action sequence work onstage.
but he never gets the spotlight.
most know my boy, cable, as the video yearbook editor.
but little do they know,
he's one of the best freestyle dancers I've seen in my life.
and, finally, smiles. nicest guy you'll ever meet.
dopest dancer on the dance floor.
don't forget moose. - moose?
Yeah, trust me on this one. - come on.
but what makes you think they'll do it?
they all have nothing to lose.
No!
you guys, listen up. check it out.
now, I know each and every one of you knows what it's like
to be forced to conform and become an msa robot, right?
Yeah, they wanted me to cut my hair.
Yeah, and fix my teeth.
I like your teeth. - thank you.
I like your accent.
what kind of accent?
the accent you have. you have an accent.
I have no accent. - it's really strong.
that's my point.
I know that each one of you guys has an amazing talent
that this school doesn't know what to do with.
I think it's time we do something with that talent.
like what? - like form a crew
and compete at the streets.
no, no! - I heard it's dangerous.
forget about what you heard.
the streets is about the best dance crew showing off what they got.
we don't stand a chance. - what are you talking about?
I've seen you do stunts in the school play.
there's a reason they call you monster.
like this?
that was hot. - that's crazy.
kido, you went crazy at the showcase after-party last year.
Oh, that was fun.
get it, kido. - she won't... she won't stop.
she won't stop, she won't. you need to stop.
so when is it? - that's the thing.
nobody knows when or where until a text message of the night of.
so we have got to be ready.
sounds good. director collins'd never let us rehearse here.
no way. - who said director collins has to know?
he's got the keys.
borrowed and copied.
msa after hours. I like it.
Yeah! oh, man, we did good.
what do you say we go and check out our competition?
all right, let's get it started right now!
Whoo! oh, man! put your hands up.
put your hands up. I see you, baby!
want your mama again?
Hey, yo, leesh. leesh, look, look, look, look.
Andie's here. - where?
right there.
she shouldn't be.
yo, what you doing here, man?
Oh, please don't tell me that's your new crew.
no. - yeah, we're her crew.
getting ready to battle at the streets.
what street, sesame street?
what do you know about the streets? - why don't you back off?
we're just here to check a few things out.
this is how you've been wasting your time, with these losers?
why don't you do your thing? we're gonna do ours.
you got a thing that you do?
why don't you show us now, homeboy?
all right, let's go. - yeah, let's go.
Hey, yo, dj sand! drop that beat, homey.
looks like we've got new fish in town.
let's clear the dance floor. see what they talking about.
now, you come into my house, you recognize what's going on.
don't step in that circle if you ain't got it.
when do we start?
five. start on five when I start.
the music's playing already. dance to the music.
that's not how we do it here.
this ain't high school musical.
that's how you dance? your mama taught you that?
we don't dance like that.
that's what you learned at your special school?
Boo! quit it!
that's atrocious.
- that's it. no more.
no more. what in the hell was that?
that's how you dance? I'll tell you what.
we gonna show you how we really get down.
y'all pick up a keychain on the way out.
tell your mama not to be late picking you up from work.
you guys are garbage!
lets get it. four-one-oh, can we get it started?
let's get it started. here we go.
four-one-oh, forget them. let's get it.
that's what I'm talking about.
see how they entertaining?
that's how we do it.
you can't learn that in school!
let's just... let's just regroup tomorrow.
come on.
guys, come on. this is one performance.
guys, come on. this is one performance.
you can't let it get you down.
we didn't work this hard to just give up.
shouldn't have went there in the first place.
we looked like idiots.
chase, the choreography wasn't right for this.
- no, it wasn't.
I'm telling you.
it's cool. I know her.
what are you doing here?
things got out of hand last night.
Yeah. thanks for your support.
look, I'm sorry.
what they did to you was wrong.
but you should know that I quit. - what?
Yeah. they're on such a power trip. I refuse.
I thought we were supposed to be about family.
and it just wasn't the same without you.
but, look, I miss you. I haven't seen you in that long.
my family's having a barbeque this saturday.
why don't you come through?
so that's why you came by? - yeah.
you know, felicia is going to trip if she knows you're here.
Felicia should be the last of your worries right now.
I swear, we're really not that bad.
really. come on.
Hey, you guys, this is my girl, missy.
she's here to, uh... help us out.
help us out? we bombed last night.
our respect went out the window.
sure did.
hold up, hold up, hold up.
what are y'all talking about, respect went out the window?
like respect is going? you can always get it back.
what are you all thinking for the prank?
what's the prank?
yo, d, you ain't tell them about the prank?
the prank is what the crews do to show they're competing for the streets.
it's a public declaration saying that you're bringing it.
the crazier it is, the better.
for proof you gotta record it and post it online.
then it spreads like wildfire.
and if you guys hit it like I know you can, y'all get your respect back.
I got an idea.
watch this, watch this! oh-ho!
been runnin' that ball on him all day, son.
that's what I'm talkin' about.
yo, man.
Why's my crib smell like funyuns, broccoli and ball sweat?
it's your boy, crumbs. he's been letting it loose all day.
it's the coffee, bro.
yo, tuck, come see this. you gotta come see this, bro.
Oh, dang!
relax, relax. - that's my computer, man!
man, clean this fish up!
moose, what are you doing?
maybe we should put you back in that grandma suit, huh?
- who's we?
Hey, what are you guys doing?
Hi, sophie. what's up? - rehearsing for the fundraiser.
why are you here on a saturday?
we were gonna do the same thing, but it's locked.
we gotta roll, so we'll see y'all. - where are we going?
to my house. my family's having a barbecue, remember?
Yeah, yeah, barbecue. - why you standing there?
let's be out.
are you going with them?
uh, yeah, yeah. I'd say you should go, but...
but I'm not really sure it's your scene.
I'd love to.
all right.
watch your step. welcome.
look at how nice it is. - thank you.
come down, hurry up. You all taking mad long.
Hey, mom!
how are you?
we missed you. everyone is here. come in.
have some food. - whoa, wait.
you're coming with me.
where are we going? - you'll see.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
what's wrong with what I had before?
latin men like their girls to look like women, not boys.
a fact you'll appreciate when you meet my cousin.
you are not setting me up.
Alejandro's nice. plus he just got here.
you're pimping me out so that your cousin
can get a green card?
he's from florida.
trust me, if he was not my cousin, you would not be standing there.
you're sick.
and I'm hungry, so are we done here?
I guess.
Ooh, miss thing, you got titties?
why you trying to look better than me at my party?
Hey, cuz. - hey, mama.
how you doing? this is my friend, andie.
Andie, my cousin, alejandro.
nice to meet you. - nice to meet you.
I'm just gonna sit down while you guys talk.
you want to dance a real dance? - I'd love to.
come on, mama.
may I borrow your boyfriend? - oh, he's not my boyfriend.
it doesn't matter. it's just a dance.
it's just a dance.
Andie, come here.
you should really wait your turn.
I couldn't.
I didn't know you could salsa.
there's a lot you don't know about me.
which is surprising, considering how much you talk about yourself.
what's going on over here?
my goodness, aunt maria. it has been emotional.
- I'll hit you up on myspace sometime.
thank you. you are charming.
thank you so much. - I had a good time.
me, too. don't tell your husband about us, now.
Bye.
God?
you want to fly up here and give me a hand with these lights?
Sophie, what's up, girl? let me find out.
you got a lot of stuff going. a lot of sofrito up in you.
thank you. you're not so bad yourself.
Gracias, gracias. moose, help me with these lights.
mom's gonna kill me. hurry up.
hurry up! - hold this. I'm coming.
Sophie, I'll do it, I'll do it.
I'll do it. you're welcome.
there we go. - this is really high.
no, it's not that bad.
Yes, it is. - no, we're good.
all right. tree climber.
all right, this is gonna sound cheesy, but...
...for what it's worth, I'm really glad you're at msa.
I think you were doing just fine before I got there.
that's just the thing. I mean, I've been trained to dance since I first learned to walk.
but it's always been about doing it their way and it's just not me.
but, ever since you came, I feel more like myself.
Oh, geez.
well, I know what you mean.
my mom always used to tell me, "just be yourself."
when I was little that sounded strange,
cause I was like, "how could I be anyone else?"
I bet you miss her. - yeah.
when she got cancer, it was like the floor fell from underneath.
I've just been running ever since.
but now I can't find my way back.
well, maybe it's not about going back.
maybe it's about being right where you are.
I heard you was dancing it up in there.
what, you not joking now?
come on, guys, I'm just trying to get home.
you thought it was real funny, what you did the other day.
tuck, it's a joke. - look here.
just 'cause you hang out with d don't mean you got what it takes.
she don't know where she came from.
you don't know anything about her.
so now you defending her?
Yes, I am. I'll see you at the streets.
at the streets? you in the streets now.
unless you want some more of us,
I suggest you stay away from the streets.
and stay farther away from andie. drop this fool.
come on, get up, fool.
get up!
you're not so funny now,
are you, clown?
Hey, yo, tuck.
chase, what's going on?
how you doing? is everything ok?
Yes, everything's ok. why wouldn't everything be ok?
Oh, my god. what happened to you? - nothing. nothing.
don't worry. listen, I've got to get to class.
that is not nothing. who did this to you?
just forget about it. let it go.
who did this?
does anybody know who is responsible for this?
this school will not be associated with these competitions.
any future involvement by our students in the streets will lead to expulsion.
and anyone with any information is expected to come forward.
get this place cleaned up.
man, I can't believe they trashed the studio.
now we have director collins on our back.
glass is all over the floor. - somebody broke the stereo.
I don't understand.
these guys are no joke.
Collins was pissed.
graffiti was everywhere. - what are we gonna do?
we could get expelled. - my parents would kill me if I got expelled.
I'd have to go to a regular school with regular kids.
Hey, guys.
this has gotten way out of hand.
I'm really sorry that I got you all into this.
Andie, don't say that.
I put everything you guys worked for at risk.
and it's not fair.
we're all in on this together. - yeah, yeah.
no, it's over.
the crew's done. I don't know what we were thinking.
Andie west, director collins would like to see you.
by being involved in this you've brought delinquent
behavior into my school and put my students at risk.
and now the studio has been vandalized.
it wasn't exactly like that.
I thought I could train you,
turn you into the dancer that you could be.
but I was wrong.
there's nothing that we can do for someone who doesn't appreciate what's in front of them
I understand.
you know, I really did try.
I'm not done.
was there anyone else involved from this school?
no.
no one else. just me.
then I have no choice but to expel you.
but I didn't... - I'm sorry.
that's it. I'm finished. please leave.
Andie.
there you are. I've been looking all over for you.
what are we gonna do? - it's done.
everything's done.
I think it's pretty clear that none of this was meant to be.
whoa, andie.
don't do this.
please just... just let it go.
you got that?
you're my big strong boy, huh?
I am your big strong boy.
your school called.
I know I said things would be different...
I know what happened.
no more excuses, andie. I'm sick and tired of this.
you're going to your aunt's in texas, and that's final.
it was my idea.
your idea for what? - to compete in the streets.
if you're gonna throw someone out it should have been me.
don't be ridiculous. I'm not throwing you out.
how would that make me look?
I'm not gonna let her take the fall for this.
I should never have let her in.
it didn't benefit us in any way.
not everything we do has to benefit us.
some people, andie in particular, do what they love just because.
isn't that why we started dancing in the first place?
look, I have a lot to do for the fundraiser.
and so do you.
my decision about andie is final. we're done here.
Oh, peggy beckham.
see, this is our new building.
made of glass with state-of-the-art studios.
Hey. is andie here?
Andie?
it's for you.
what are you guys doing here? - andie, we're going.
eighth and main, the streets. we need you.
no, but what about the fundraiser?
you could all be expelled. - forget the fundraiser.
we don't want the school to move. - it's time we took a stand.
like you did. - if msa doesn't want you...
then we don't want you. - what are you talking about?
we do want andie. we want andie in, yes, right?
Yes. - look, you brought us together
and took the fall for us when we should have all done more.
Andie, that's why we're here.
we've all made a lot of mistakes, but now's our time.
we can go all the way. if we don't try, it was all for nothing.
come on, are you in?
I can't. - why?
I promised sarah I'd finish packing tonight.
Andie?
can we talk a minute?
Yeah. I'll be right back.
I made a promise to your mom to take care of you.
I want to keep it.
I know.
I understand that and I am done fighting.
you know, you remind me so much of your mother.
you have her passion.
she was a really good friend to me, andie.
just like you are to them.
I just feel like I finally found this place where I belong.
I found people who believe in me.
I believe in you, too.
I've seen a change in you.
you should go tonight.
Really?
she'd want you to.
let's do this.
Baltimore, you all ready?
we gonna get down to it, see who has the hottest skills.
the dopest squad. you ready to get it started?
it's the streets, baby.
take a left. - and slow down.
faster, faster! I love america!
it's your man, dj sand, and it's the battle of the year.
we're getting ready to get really banoodles out here.
can you all handle that?
come on, let's get wild, man.
yo, man, you see this?
are you coming? - good luck. good luck.
what part of "you don't belong here" do you not understand?
why don't you chill?
we're just trying to perform here like everyone else.
yo, homey, this is how it is.
you're not invited. this is a closed event.
for locals only.
besides, that jazz funk that y'all pulled at the dragon
ain't gonna cut it here.
neither will those moves you've been doing the past five years.
and by the way, I really liked your place,
but I think that fish made it smell better.
watch your face. I'll knock you out, you hear?
don't disrespect me in my place. - you boys fighting in my house now?
you're think you're funny?
you want to tell me what the hell is going on?
they're at the streets.
the streets?
I have to stop this. - wait.
you always tell us that dance is about having something to say.
I never meant for anyone...
I think that a lot of people are finally speaking up.
can't allow my students to participate in something illegal.
well, there's a reason they're there and not here.
you should take a look. I think you'd be surprised.
and you are? - robert alexander, iii.
but you can call me moose. I dance with their crew.
you dance?
damn right, I dance. I can take you to where they are.
OK, goose, let's go.
no, it's moose. - whatever.
wait. I'm coming with you.
it's the moment you've all been waiting for.
at this time, let me introduce the five time reigning champ.
give it up, make some noise, for the four-one-oh!
get it, four-one-oh, let's go!
let's go!
check it out, baby! that's what I'm talking about!
check it out, baby! that's what I'm talking about!
give it up to the four-one-oh!
all right, you've seen 'em all.
tell me who the hottest crew in baltimore is.
that's what you think? I don't know, the four-one-oh killed it.
all right, y'all, let's hit it. - yo, baby.
no, we're from the hood.
yo, this is a neighborhood battle.
you're out of luck. now, go home. leave.
that's mad wack,
we're gonna get to it, figure it out after this.
andie!
Hey, yo, it's not done yet. we've got one more for you.
my crew's back there. we want a shot. - we're done. doesn't matter.
not from around here, but we want a shot.
look.
we're all here because...
all right, all right. yo. some of you guys think...
some of you guys think that we don't belong here.
what is she doing? - it doesn't matter where we're from.
you are not the valedictorian.
all right, all right.
let me just say something.
the streets are supposed to be about different people coming together.
we call this a battle, but what are we fighting for?
we're all here because we have this thing we do. we dance.
right?
being a part of the street used to mean more than turf or power.
it was about bringing something new to the floor.
and it shouldn't matter what we wear,
what school or what neighborhood we're from.
because the best part of the streets is, it's not about what you've got.
it's what you make of what you've got.
so, if the four-one-oh is too scared to defend their title against us,
then, hell, we'll be outside doing our thing where the streets started.
we'll accept that.
I'm sure we've got something that will work.
hit it, hit it, hit it.
go, go, go!
Yeah, we did it, baby.
all right! whoo!
well. that was different.
Yes, sorry about the whole toe-pointing thing.
Yeah. I guess that didn't stick too well.
I'll keep working on that.
Yeah, you will, in my class. at school on monday.
Oh, my god!
whoa. hey, moose!
Yeah, you.
I think you might be in the wrong department.
now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a little explaining to do at a fundraiser.
Oh, yeah.
so, see, I told you we could help each other out.
Yeah, yeah. whatever.
whatever.
blow it up.
moose, hey. - hey, soph.
how you doing? - I'm good.
did you see us? - that was great.
sliding and flipping. my hat trick was amazing.
I was just doing it, like it was amazing.
that's what I thought.
andie! andie!
happy birthday. open your present.
blow out your candles.
you did so good. I'm so proud of you.
Andie, I love you. - I love you.
I gotta go. I gotta pump. I gotta pump.
I thought you said we couldn't start our own crew.
I thought you said my dancing was little.
look around. you brought all these people out here.
that's the homicide squad...
complete with detectives and newspapermen.
a murder has been reported from one of those great big houses...in the ten thousand block.
you'll read about it in the late editions, I'm sure.
you'll get it over your radio and see it on television...
because an old-time star is involved...
one of the biggest.
but before you hear it all distorted and blown out of proportion...
before those Hollywood columnists get their hands on it...
maybe you'd like to hear the facts... the whole truth.
if so, you've come to the right party.
you see, the body of a young man was found...
floating in the pool of her mansion...
with two shots in his back and one in his stomach.
nobody important, really.
just a movie writer with a couple of B pictures to his credit.
the poor dope. He always wanted a pool.
well, in the end he got himself a pool...
only the price turned out to be a little high.
let's go back about six months and find the day when it all started.
I was living in an apartment house above Franklin and Ivar.
things were tough at the moment.
I hadn't worked in a studio for a long time.
so I sat there, grinding out original stories, two a week.
only I seemed to have lost my touch.
maybe they weren't original enough.
