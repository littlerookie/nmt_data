so when she's not around or gets busy,
and once she's eliminated as a person of interest.
she's not like that once she gets to know you.
once she understood the mood I was going for,
there is nothing to say she won't become a good mother to them

except once she had her money,
as soon as she gets the crystal back,
once she's retrieved the module .

if her father ever found out,
as soon as her father lets her down,
would all this go away once she delivered?
once she's in, she will send a message to earth.

once her heart stopped beating,
once her heart stopped beating, there should have been hardly any blood flow

I 'll probably find out more once I get her diary translated.
when she gets you in her sights
as soon as you can get her blood pressure under control?

at a time when marrying the prince of France or the king of Spain.
you can't delay laboronce it starts.
once she asks me not to throw this wedding,
if she ever remembers me, her mind will burn and she will die.
because if she wins, she's gonna own me. My advice?
when she passes away, you're on your own.

once the child is born,
it's worth it once the baby comes. But I'm guessing that's.
once she passes that placenta, her hormones will plummet,

we're all related.
it's all connected, isn't it?

it's all in the eye of the beholder.
everything just runs directly off the blood.
everything is right out in the open.
in one another's being mingle why not I with thine?

everything would be a Roman church.
I didn't believe in fairy tales,
they all happen because God wills it.
everything's in its place.
nothing has changed, that's the problem.
everything's a test, remember? Nothing is what it seems.
it's all a matter of listening of being ready to take it down
that is a mathematical certainty.
it's all gone to shit. What do you mean?
is just to be a little spontaneous.
it will happen all by itself as you get older.
everything happens inside the city itself.
ferguson organized everything.
I stand as weak.
it's all pretence.
it's all make - believe.
it was all a pretense, an excuse to get you on your own.
nothing really happened. Yeah.
no, this isn't real.
all was nothingness
and all for nothing.
nothing's what it seems

everything's built on that! That's all we got, boy. Fucking all.
I'm putting it all behind me, you know?
just rolls right off your back, doesn't it?
he masterminded everything.
the best that this youngish man's money can buy.

it's been amazing.
everything is so freaking.

it seemed hopeless and pointless, and then, on November 19, 1863,
everything is so... white.
that everything's sticking in pretty well.
it's like everything's perfect.
this has been so much fun.
everything is spectacular.
everything's so time - consuming.

I am at peace.
it's very money - oriented, everybody worry about the living,
it's only money.
it's the money.
all are wrong
nothing goes right... Nothing goes right.
everything's negative.We obviously missed something.
everything is a conspiracy theory! I protest.
all of them unfamiliar.
everything washed fresh, a whole new cycIe.
there was this sort of freezing fog hanging over everything,
that all of this will remain off the record.
deception is everything.
if it happened.
you order fancy food in advance of your arrival.
everything is upside down
all are lies!
it's a trick.
it was all a fabrication of quilok.
everything else the man has grabbed from us.
everything's in black and white.
that everything will go wrong
it just seems unreal.
and things seem so sharp.
everything seemed so important,
everything seems to indicate close - contact gunshot wound.
and every indicator says it can't be done.
it's too late.
it's too late, mom.
but it's too late, my darling.
it was too late. I was already pregnant.

always possible,
I've got everything down except for the timer.
everything was a bit weird.
everything I got people counting on it.
it's all in a good cause. That doesn't make it less embarrassing.
there's always a cost.
everything has a purpose, Colonel, including the circumstances that brought me here.
you got everything covered，I think we can handle it.
nothing lasts forever, not even a picture.
always a possibility.
and anything was possible
all is possible. Everything.
and anything can happen
all the things that could have happened to have made you feel he had changed.
it could have been anything. I'm very upset.
it can happen. That is all I'm saying!
so anything's possible, right?
Mike things are looking up.
it's like you said it would be.
things have way of changing.
but all things have their time.
everything was going right on schedule.
everything remains to be done.
Yes, everything will make sense.
all things in their proper order.
nothing is disturbed. Perhaps they heard us.
there's a sense of purpose. We're a community.
since that night,
something's wrong about all this, Trust me.
everything was slightly mad,
there's always the threat of everything falling apart.
there's always a first time.
this all makes sense. There were so many signs.
it must be nice having all the answers.
everything could just cease to exist.
everything is in order. The same doctor
only clues.
it's everything. If there was one thing you could pick out you'd try to fix it,
everything has a hidden meaning.
everything was going right.
all very positive. Yeah.
nothing ever changed.
everything was gonna be fine, it was just going to be this stupid little secret
it's too late.
all in good time.
it just all happened so fast.
it's all happening too soon. You moving in.
it's all happening so fast and it sort of feels like it has nothing to do with me.
out of the blue.
having all this happen at once, A marriage, a baby,
like it came so natural.
everything is happening so quickly...
how slow all of a sudden.
it got very real very fast and I panicked.
the history of the problem
the same area where all that happened.
it all went down pretty fast, I mean.
it'll all come naturally. Isn't that right, Pullo?
everything comes from the East.
it all came from the stars, but how?
who owes everything to some unknown alien scientist
a dumbing down.
everything checked out. Sounds like you had a pretty tough day.
Yeah, it's over.
they're all labelled in terms of time.
that everything will happen when you want it,
everything glittered and was golden.
and it will all come true.
things have been great now
everything's hunky - dory， because you got me in the sack
everything was kind of fuzzy.
all a blur of sparkly.
and things were booming along.
we got it going on.
that would be this working.
it was just getting good.
everything's changing.
everything comes back normal.
ready for normalcy. - good.
things in common, old friends.
everything's all right， Just calm down. I am calm. I'm calm.
everything fine?

and everything's cool, right?
everything's fine. This is true.
everything seemed fine.
everything was fine until her phone rang.
have they been normal？
everything all right? Fine.
well, everything is on track.
everything's dead, Lincoln.
everything is dead quiet, it seems almost eerie.
everything is fucked.
it's totally ruined,
ruined everything!
it's all been spoiled and wasted,
that's how the whoIe thing got screwed up. I broke the covenant.
you have ruined everything
totally in ruins!
there is nothing to worry about.
everything's brighter than it was a week ago.
everything's much easier than for us.
everything was so much more amazing than I could've imagined.
it all went faster than planned.
there was no ambiguity!
it all feeIs so random... What we're doing？
it just strikes suddenly， without warning.
it all means so little.
have gone right back into her hands, don't you think?
somehow you know when the time is right.
zat explains everything!
it's never too late.
and the gibes of all
everything is gone.
is everything... Gone?
the breeze all
it's all gone now. Everything I ever made.
everything's gone but the Lise insurance.
this is it, mark.
everything's going great today.
and everything turned out okay.
everything's all right
so things are all right?
everything's all right now. My dearest.
everything's all right. Just calm down

and everything is okay.
Hey, everything okay?

it is what it is.
it was pretty uneventful.
so we're all good there.
got you at the end of the day.
well, that's all right
it's okay... Fly first class.
it's all about the variables.
nothing is ready.
it never happened.
none of it's happening.
it's all still there.
nothing's changed, huh?
nothing has changed, has it?
nothing's been decided yet. The autopsy report
it was all just for nothing!
this doesn't make any sense anymore.
for either of us, did they?
it hasn't changed. Let's go.
so we lost everything? We never had everything.
everything was all right.
it is not ready.
it hasn't happened.
it didn't all happened. It was all planned, right?
it's always now.
too many things haven't changed. Like what?
it would never stop.
we had no warning I was doing dishes when I got the call
all are nonsense
it means nothing.
nothing matters.
kiss of the bitch.
it's meaningless, she's suffocating.
nothing has gone according to the goddamn plan!
and nothing is going the way we planned.
always just stays the same!
but nothing has changed
no change.
nothing's changing, you know,
nothing has changed. I'm still a pig, you're still a human vacuum cleaner.
everything's fine. These things take time.
everything will be fine. Oatmeal's ready.
nothing works.
nothing is working.
everything isn't so fixed.
and everything would be all right.
nothing's wrong,
everything is fine, and everything is completely normal.
it'll all be taken care of.
everything's all right. You'll be all right.
that nothing's wrong right now?
things are cool, aren't they, mum?
is everything okay?
everything all right in there? don't come in.
is everything all right, doctor?
I'll check this with the manager. Mr. Murdock.
everything's fine. I went out with your sister.
that's absolutely no problem.
it's all right,
everything's fine, all you gotta do is stand up.
everything is gonna be okay. I know it.
everything's fine, aunt Josephine.
all right, everything checks out, so let's get you paid.
now I can't.
it's in his blood.
well, everything's coming up us, kid.
everything was dead and not a soul was Ieft in the world.
like everything else.
that everything's away now
everything is fading. We're no longer here.
that that's it, it's over?
everything fell apart. He couldn't write anymore.
when all seems lost, the future unknowable,
have all passed away.
everything got all off.
everything was made clear.
everything went white.
everything clear? Perfectly clear.
and it was just as clear as day.
it's been wiped clean.
things are looking up, Giselle.
all from one...
it all begins with a curse.
it comes in their dreams.
it all started with your $200, let's show him how to gamble.
it aII started on the streets of Detroit,
it was all a little bet we made to see just how gullible you could be.
all of this started when I put this ring on my finger.
it all started with the book. A book?
this all began on the train to Cardiff, appropriately enough,
everything depends on that code. Did you understand anything?
is everything satisfactory?
is everything satisfactory? Everything except the interruption.
everything looks beautiful. Thanks.
everything became this big conspiracy.
everything dies.
everything was destroyed.
could end?
it just went up like that,
everything is nailed in our memory,
and everything gets cleaned away.
every plan I had vanished.
everything burns
everything will be swell then.
I did everything you asked.
everything was done as it was supposed to be done.
it's all right here, honey.
everything is on straight ahead. In fact don't tell anyone.
everything is kept just as Mrs. De winter liked it.
everything's worked out just as we'd hoped.
make sure you lock everything up good, all right?
this is done by the book.
all protocol was followed, sir.
it was done by the book until you rewrote it!
everything is complete as planned.
it's all going to plan. He's half in love with her already.
everything just went out.
impregnable to about anything but artillery.
everything is looking different now.
we're all his
and it's understood
it's all okay. It 'sokay because I turned thirty today.
water brings on an explosion of life
we have looked through everything.
my name's on everything, right?
I guess it all begins with a scientist.
everything is done up by cellphone.
and that it's out of his control.
leader of everything.
everything is in the hands of the gods.
you're choosing everything.
that was decided by your votes last night.
to even begin to make things up to you.
and it's on your conscience.
it's ours for the taking.
it's all done through our nonprofit corporation.
and do all of it without a corporation
we've taken care of everything? We've just hired a valet and confirmed a caterer.
I'll do everything.
I'm gonna take care of all this. You have nothing to worry about, all right?
and I will make all the arrangements.
I'll do all the work. I got us that building back there.
and that's how this works, okay?
I've got this under control.
my great grand father Sozin happend.
everything's going digital.
he does everything electronically.
everything goes to my next of kin. What about you?
everything is crazy now.
than the best of humanity.
and everything's pointing to fifth column.
everything's the same.
everything would have been fine if you'd just...
everything worked for me, up until the chapter on your first campaign.
everything's fairly dire.
it's in God's hands now.
there's a lot riding on this night. Not just for me.
I guess the radish is in your basket now.
you're taking all the chances.
it's up to you now. Here we go. Here we go.
so much depends on this working out.
well, everything looks good except for one thing.
makes everything a painting.
it all looks fantastic, man.
everything looks in order.
all seems very neat and peaceful, doesn't it?
everything looks delicious.
none of this looks familiar. Are you sure we're going the right way?
it's just the straight from it to certain death.
everything really will be over.
everything is getting really scary and really crazy.
this is real, and this is gonna be your new life.
you may find that hard to believe,
everything's coloured, everything, you know？
everything comes out.
everything breaks.
things fall apart.
everything's falling apart I've lost my wife, my daughters, my onetime mistress, my son.
this is so messed up.
everything's all messed up. What's messed up?
things are wrapping up, so I'm betting it's soon.
it will meet in secret, if your Majesty agrees.
everything's been orderly, and it's all gone like clockwork.
hubby's dead, the cubs have been slaughtered,
it all happened real fast.
it sort of turned into a reenactment of the inquisition.
everything that points to the profile,
everything's still holding within operational parameters.
everything on the up-and-up ?
it fits everything but the nosebleed.
simplifies everything. You get your life back.
if things would've been easier.
let's just get this over with, Cartman.
everything is accounted for fairy godmother except for one potion. What?
everything counts.
but everything is going well.
everything pretty much sucks.
you know, as awful as all of this is
everything's going to shit right now, OK?
and it was all a little bit rubbish.
everything's faliing apart
things get really bad!
everything's going to hell, Ernie.
everything's bad now, I know... - stop talking.
sort of stretched.
everything is tested and ready for use.
nothing is left to chance.
it fits together.
all to be over
it's done.
after everything you've done,
all finished.
and so it ended.
but it's all over now.
he's throwing in the towel.
issue closed?
it's all over
that's it, man.
the mass has ended. Go in peace to love and serve the Lord.
this game over? Game's not over.
everything is over! Everything is over!
it was done. Less than a minute.
it's over. don't come to my house, don't touch me.
it's all over. Daniel's accepted and handed in his keys
it's over. Why don't you give it a rest?
it's all over, honey.
it's over, baby. You missed. - That's charitable of you.
then it's over. All of this is meaningless.
it's over. You don't understand. They made me do it.
it's over. You're out.
it's all over. What's your name?
all is done now. You can go off and love your husband,
it's over. I'm your only hope.
all are finished, you get what you want
then it's all over do whatever you want
it's over. Are you crazy?
it's over. You know that, right?
it is done. You are free, my love.
it's over, and you're under arrest.
it's over, brother. It's over. OK.
it's done, senior Garza.
it's over, doc. There's nowhere to go.
it's over, Jim.
it's over I will decide when it's over
it's over，Spence
it's over. Agreed.
is it over?
so the game's up. The chickens have come home to roost.
it was all over in less than a minute.
it's over. Good.
it's over! - that was easy.
it's over! That was easy.
it's over. She's gonna die.
it's over. She's gone.
it's over. She knows it.
it is over, sister.
it's over, honey.
it's all over. - so that's it? Then we failed?
case closed. Let's shoot them.
it's over.
it's over. It shortly will be, yeah.
it's over, Gusano. Let Dakota go.
now that it's over, I don't want to talk about it any more.
it's over, I'm not running anymore.
it's done, and I'm sorry for everything.
it's gone, and I'm coming home.
this is the end. We're all doomed.
it's all over with now. We might as well not even show up to graduation.
we're finished. It's over we're done.
it's so over. And it was wrong.
and that's final. I decide what's final!
it's over. I'm finished.
it's over. - I knew it.
that's over. I signed the divorce papers.
this is over! I'm take her in.
then it's over. I didn't call the police, but don't push me.
it's over. I'm go home now.
this is it. I'm letting him go.
it's over. I win.
it's over, Dana.
it's over. So if you just...
that's it. Shoot him, robo.
it's over, Tom! Put down your weapon!
it's all over. It's OK. It's over.
it's over. - no.
it's over. Fuck you!
and it's over and then he calls four times in one morning.
it's over, Trevor.
it's over, Marietta. Mandy and I were a terrible mistake， I've come back foryou.
it is all over, momon.
what we do now？ that it's over.
it's over, Percy.
it's over.
it's over, Jean.
they're past, pimenov. It's finished.
now, it's over and it's been an incredible journey
it's over, Forster.
it's over, Costa, you're under arrest.
end of the line, Millicent.
party's over, Miro!
now that it's all over, after this incredible ordeal, what are your feelings?
it's over. It's over.
no way we survive this. Death is coming!
it's over, Eddie.
it's over. Come with me.
is over, done with and forgotten, okay?
I'm done here. - you're not done here.
it's over, it's over.
it's over... So over.
it's over. And unless you want the whole world to know you run a high - class prostitute ring,
so what are you gonna do when all this is over?
when this is all over, why don't you do it?
when this is over, you're gonna do something for me. - what?
we'll leave this place together when all of this is over.
once this whole thin is over and done, we're gonna get back there.
I'll tell you when it's over.
now when this is all over, you need to tell me where you're registered.
it's all over, my princess.
I'll see you when it's all over.
of what's gonna happen to me when all this comes to an end.
when all this is over, someone's buying the first round.
at the end, I mean.
you can have everything.
everything has been arranged.
has everything been explained to you?
everything's ready for you. Thank you.
it's the undertaking.
it was really nice.
it's so passe.
couldn't be a lot of words?
it's all connected. Shut up.
we have the chain.
everything comes out exact.
so everything can start over.
I mean is to go back and start over.
and things can stay the way they are.
and everything goes back to normal.
they say that things will be okay,
is it as good as we hoped?
thing that'll work out.
nothing you can sing that can't be sung
everything can wait, we must search.
everything can stay the same.
can solve everything.
which way our hearts will go.
meant we could always be that open.
everything else gets shorted.
the whole deck's gonna be reshuffled. Seven, six, five.
you sure that thing's gonna hold you up?
you stayed after all the others deserted.
and everything somehow seems right.
the curtain falls. An iron curtain.
so all this was for nothing.
kept it inside didn't tell no - one else.
with everything staring down at us,
those moments where everything sort of comes together.
everything working?
all factors suggest he has nothing to lose.
everything about this guy says he was on the up - and - up.
probably cost him a stripe. So where's the diamonds and the bassinets, huh?
it was bad work all around. I'll take the heat.
everything points to someone who fled after the shooting.
all of which would suggest that Moriarty may be right.
you look totally in control
everything was already done by the native people 2,000 years ago
everything hurts so bad
and you messed it all up.
and ruined everything!
you ruined everything.
everything is squeezed for you
you were right - about everything.
the hillside was like ice cream.
everything was cold and frozen.
everything's frozen.
everything has been taken away. So that really sent me into a tail spin.
she's destroying everything!
it's already decided.
I'm the only one doing any work here.
everything's shit, dad.
everything is being twisted into a sort of tunnel shape.
all totally wiped down. Almost like it was...
they've taken everything. - not quite everything.
everything has been destroyed.
so everything was destroyed?
it changes everything.
it changes everything
everything was inventoried.
everything is ruined.
and, in fact everything has been cleaned up and put away.
everything charred virtually beyond recognition.
everything's been approved, so we're on.
everything was restricted, everything was censored.
everything is backwards now, like out there is the true world
and all in darkness.
by the time you get back.
it all started when.
it started a little over a year ago.
I had to learn everything all over again, you know?
it all starts with the starlight scope,
everything's going to change now, isn't it?
because it's always about you.
does everything have to be about you?
it's important that everything look right.
we relied on it for everything.
everything had to be confidential.
everything is classified there
now just keep it simple. Just like we practice.
and all with the strength of that rose.
everything has to be moved up
everything's coming apart.
everything must be perfect.
it all depends on other people.
everything is going to change.
okay, move on, Angela!
the attending takes the lead.
everyone must obey orders
you'll be doing what the doctors say. Got it?
and I am now calling the shots.
and he wants it by tomorrow night.
everything's coming to an end.
that everything's perfect for Mr. Debris
perfection, people.
I want to make sure everything is perfect.
all must hurry. This will all be over in moments.
everything should just be on the table.
everything has to be cleaned.
everything receives a spit and a polish.
she wants fabulous that is her simple request
I want fabulous that is my simple request
and it's thanks to her.
I have to do everything!
I'm trying to do it by myself. I can't just pull up stakes and take off by myself.
I need to do it on my own.
everything is packed
everything must to be your way.
everything was going according to the little girl's plan,
your informant is making all the rules.
and everything was going to plan.
everything in its proper box.
all that was going to change.
that's all gonna change.
it's all going to change.
I want only dummy text and up on that wall.
everything must be fast, loud, noisy
find out everything about her, and bring her to me tonight.
everything is fucked up.
everything washed a whole new cycle.
this is happening according to our way.
it was imperative that everything went according to plan.
we do everything in writing.
everything depends on what you make of this opportunity.
it wasn't me it was you
wait until we are in uniform, my boy.
it all ends here.
this has to end.
it was curtains and everybody knew it, but nobody said so.
end of the line, cool breeze.
everything steamed, organic and germ - free.
everything needs to be destroyed. Every last bolt.
everything's got to be perfect for.
thanks for everything. Pleasure.
everything in moderation.
it'll all be quick.
this plays out by the book. Not in a back room with a rubber hose.
there are laws.
all hunched up, pretending to be so damned understanding.
it all had to be very discreet
you have to make every move your own.
that's what makes the whole thing work.
it all depends on the heat shield.
it's amazing what you can come to take for normal.
everything is in its place.
everything is solved.
everything's worked out, you're going to the convention.
it's all been sorted out. Back to normal.
everything's settled. I fixed it.
everything's fine, dad. We decided not to go.
well, we got it all worked out, sweetie!
it closes the circle.
it's all for all real.
it's all for real
it's all for real, I'm telling you just how I feel,
it's all in play.
well, it was all slotting into place
planning so that I don't brake unnecessarily.
everything's timed out to perfection.
everything's been worked out so the image hits the right spot.
everything's booked. So the really big question is where are we going to stay?
all this gives me a stomachache.
he got everything.
say everything that's upsetting you.
whatever comes next.
it's terrifying for me.
and I'm just thrilled about everything.
I ruined everything.
refreshing.
it was never dull.
it all makes sense.
everything's set. Where'd she find him?
all the right notes.
all confirming that he is not my son.
it just goes to show - vulgar.
let's stop all this.
everything is rational.
and everything is supposed to be perfect.
everything is supposed to end.
let's get this thing over with...
all shall be forgotten.
all that's forgotten?
all shall be forgotten? You don't say.
none of this makes any sense. He just hurt his arm, dad.
makes perfect sense.
I mean it all adds up.
and it appears they worked as a team.
everything about this place stinks of "government ops."
that's all there is to it.
it all makes sense now.
it all makes so much sense.
everything's been negotiated.
thanks for everything.
everything is totally clear now.
and it was all out in the open?
it all makes sense now, doesn't it?
being where you supposed to be. You believe in that?
and has somehow made it look like you did it.
everything looked clear like glass.
it all seems so long ago
being in the right place.
it all started with the gangs. You know, people tend to forget that.
it started here with a vow to never let this happen again.
it all began with the very first molecule.
it all began Able's garage.
than you can possibly imagine, because he loves you.
everything is just super.
things are finally back to normal.
it could be forever and ever and ever.
this was rock bottom.
everything is exactly the way it was before.
everything turned out the way you wanted.
everything that follows is a result of what you see here.
it was about who you are, what you are, or what you believe in.
it happened just like you said it would.
it's all got to do with the rabbit's foot.
and how this all connects to the mayor.
everything's been just like usual.
is everything like usual?
Oh, because it's all about luck.
everything out here has to be sexualized.
nothing like I thought it would be.
that's just how I dreamed of it.
everything's exactly the way I left it.
everything just like on my funny little map.
it all has to do with Warner Kaminsky.
you're so dramatic.
this has everything to do with the cops.
it's about the money.
it's about food.
it's in the shadows.
the context shifts. Things you thought were luxuries become essential.
everything's over so quickly
it all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network.
everything's up to code.
everything passes on.
all have past
all in the past.
all that's gone now. Can I call you next weekend?
after all that's passed, knowing all you know now.
is it all over?
well, it's all working out, huh?
it's gone. What happened to it?
it's all over now. Think about me.
it's over, now we can get on with the rest of our lives.
passing is passing.
everything's all right. I'm going to take you home.
all is forgiven, my little ladybug.
that was low, going over my head like that.
it's over. Dad!
so this is over. Finished.
let it go, Maurice.
it's over, okay?
it's all for the best. All for the best.
there, there.
and now it's over, and we're just friends.
I feel like time will go by and we'll all run into each other
it's already started. This is it.
just all went by so fast.
and that problem disappears.
have worked pretty good.
everything is pretty and perfect.
everything's perfectly normal.
everything is still the same.
until we have gathered the rest.
everything is so uncertain! Sir William says my life is still in danger.
that's a good thing, right?
is it too late, darling?
are you settling all right?
everything would still be running normally.
because they live in my memory.
and things would be just like they were? Thanks for making the time.
I don't feel like anything is missing.
it's still a work in progress, but Rome wasn't built in a day.
everything is still operational. The emergency system is already rerouting power.
boy, everything looks so good.
everything all right in here?
is everything okay? Were you worried about little about me?
everything is OK? Very well.
everything okay? It's great, thanks.
everything's okay, but you gotta stay still. Where's Sam?
things were going well until she wanted to...
is everything okay with... - waffles.
uh, well, everything is okay, but we have no way to leave.
Yeah, it's all right, so long as you keep your head down and do your bird.
everything all right up there?
to make sure everything was okay.
we okay?
that make everything okay now?
is everything okay, Giovanni?
is everything okay, honey?
is everything okay? Your son?
everything okay? You been going to your doctor's appointments?
how's everything going? What do you think?
is everything okay, sir?
everything go all right, lieutenant?
is everything okay with... Waffles.
is everything alright, Mrs Goodfellow?
everything all right? Uh, not exactly.
is everything all right? Oh, yes, indeed.
is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry.
everything all right? Yeah, I'm just doing some thinking.
how did everything go? - great!
is everything okay? No, I'm fine.
is everything all right? Angela, I have to go to my brother's for a while.
everything okay over there, pen?
everything cool? I'm cool, man.
is everything fabulous? Yes. I didn't know you were here.
is everything okay, Dexter?
is everything okay? We just got a call from the alarm company.
is everything all right? Did we do something wrong?
is it all set? Hope so.
everything okay? - I'm good.
everything good here? Just fine.
everything okay? - yeah, these gentlemen were just leaving.
everything alright? - yeah.
everything's OK? yes.
is everything okay? - I'm fine.
