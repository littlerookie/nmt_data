how far to the opening? -1. 4 kilometers.
we're still generating too hot a field. -Ghost, kill all auxiliary systems.
give me full manual. Drop down four pads. -lt'll bottom out.
easy, baby. -Seven hundred meters.
if we can just get close enough...
six hundred meters.
there.
shit!
jig's up, here they come. -Give me full power.
man the gun turrets, every goddamn one of them. Go!
ghost, you're the best gunner, go with them. Morpheus, take his place.
I'm coming, baby.
here they come.
slow down, this ain't the Logos. -Hang on to your lunch, Roland, here we go.
holy Christ, I didn't know this ship could do that.

Oh, my God.

Oh, shit!
bogey two at the breach point! -Goddamn it!

damn it!
Yeah.

just give me one clean shot.
damn it!
Charra!
I got incoming! -We got a dock full of incoming!
Yes, sir. But this is different, sir. -What?
I think it's one of ours, sir.
that's impossible. -Holographics are trying to confirm.
contact them. I want access codes.
we're trying, sir. There's no response.
it's a trick. That's not one of ours, it can't be.
that's a mechanical line. No one can pilot mechanical.
forward aft, 30 degrees at 80 percent. -Thirty degrees, 80.
lower starboard 60 degrees, 20 percent. -Sixty degrees.
Hey! What do you think you're doing?!
you're a punk, Sam! - Get off.
I ought to kill you! You fucking dickhead!
I told you to never touch my camera! - Stop!
didn't l?! Fucker! You little wimp! Bitch! Pussy! I told you!
I ought to fucking kill you! And I will kill you, you little punk, if I ever catch you fucking with my camera again.
he's so gonna cry. - Step on him!
get out of my way! - Relax, man.
are you OK?
you ever stare at the ceiling till it started looking kind of funny?
like it was breathing. Like it was saying something.
like it was saying, "Rocky, you gotta do something about what's been going on.
something's gotta happen, Sam.
something's gotta give.
we can call the police.
police wouldn't do jack.
I wish I was bigger.
I'm bigger.
not to mention the fact that I'm smarter.
if you do something, he'll just get you.
did you ever used to get me when we used to play hide-and-seek?
no. - He wouldn't have any better luck.
wanna know my secret hiding spot?
the roof.
the disappearing man.
exactly.
so high. Oh, my God.
Rocky's thinking about doing something to George.
I don't get how the teachers can just let him get away with that.
teachers don't care.
they have him in detention for 15 minutes for a week.
something's gotta give.
if you could snap your fingers right now, and he would drop dead in his tracks, would you do it?
are we still on for Saturday?
Yeah, of course.
so, what are we gonna do?
I'll figure something out, and I'll surprise you.
Hey, you know that fat kid, George, who they keep holding back from graduating middle school?
Yeah, I hate that guy.
he beat up Sam.
no.
Hey, you know when we were at Rollins, that crazy kid chased me across the field and cracked my head open with a bat.
finally, an explanation. - Yeah, anyway...
he's a real pig. - I say we smoke that ham.
yeah? Make some ham sandwiches?
pork chop-ify him. Spam-icize him.
link sausage-ize him! - Squeal, piggy! Squeal!
no, screw that guy.
you'd really like to do that, wouldn't you, Clyde?
you're projecting, Marty. - Projecting?
that's when you say something that someone else...
you say that they want to do, when you're the one who wants to do it.
no, no, no. That's good. That's good.
hold up, Rocky. Back up. I got something for you.
just a little...
Oh, you son of a bitch! - I was just projecting.
Oh, you asshole!
later.
wait up, man!
let's go get some ice cream.
OK, Dave.
Hey!
Hey!
where were you guys? - Get beat up today?
see any new scars?
got any more gum? - I'm chewing the whole pack.
why, you want some?
tasty.
OK,
Jennifer Lopez or the girl who sits behind you in school?
J. Lo.
OK, I think I got one.
tie him to a tree, pour some honey on his face, and leave him there all day and night.
Why? - It's for the bugs, so they'd get on him and bite him.
no, we can't do that. - Why not?
well, what if a bear came?
shut up.
you know, if we hurt him, we'd be just as bad as him.
so we need to hurt him without really hurting him.
I mean, if you could think of something like that, then...
then what?
I don't know.
all right, Heather Locklear or Shannen Doherty?
don't know who Heather Locklear is.
you don't...? Dude!
so, what do you say?
I think it's a totally wild plan.
it's also the only plan my brother would agree to.
he's just a little fucking Gandhi, isn't he?
like a fucking white Martin Luther King.
all we need now is a boat.
Hey, my neighbor's got a boat in her back yard that she never uses.
does that mean you're in? - Do you actually think he'll go for it?
Oh, please. George'll get a hard-on as soon as he picks up the phone.
rock will throw on some of that "sweet boy" charm of his.
kid's desperate. Stupid. It's human nature.
all I know is, is I'm getting a hard-on just thinking about it.
your mom don't need the car Saturday, does she?
the only thing my mom needs on Saturdays is Valium.
what do you think, Clyde?
do we want to give Georgie Porgie a little taste of his own medicine? Huh?
be some good, clean fun, don't you think?
Yeah, he deserves it, doesn't he?
if there's one thing that can't be argued, it's that that fat freak deserves whatever he's got coming to him.
dude, what'd I tell you?
you don't smoke herb.
Yeah, so get it out of my face.
faggot.
Clyde-o,
I'm just fucking with you.
you're not a faggot, all right?
OK?
fist bump?
fist bump?
OK, zero kilter.
besides, I like your dads, Clyde.
I never knew any homosexual men personally until I met them.
they're not so bad.
don't you think so, Rocky?
Clyde, don't worry about Marty.
it's just B. S.
OK? Come on. It's B. S.
OK? It's B. S! B. S! Come on!
OK?
Hello? George?
Hey, hey. This is Rocky Maris, Sam's older brother.
Yeah. I got your number off the call list.
is that OK? Great.
well, what I wanted to call you about was...
is that I'm inviting you to... To a party for Sam.
now, I know that you two have been having some trouble lately.
but you know what?
he's always talking about how cool you are.
and it would really mean a lot to him if you could come.
it's his birthday.
it's on Saturday at noon.
we can pick you up if you'd like.
we're going boating. We're going on a boating trip.
you like boating?
Yeah, awesome. So the only thing that I can really ask you to do, is not tell too many people.
because we didn't really invite a lot of people, and...
and, you know, everyone knows everybody in this town.
and you tell your parents, parents will tell other parents, and those parents will tell their kids.
and pretty soon everyone who didn't get invited will be sitting at home, crying. We don't want that, do we?
there you go. So do you want me to pick you up at noon? Awesome!
so I will see you at noon, George.
awesome. Have a great day. Bye.
Oh, God. - What did he say?
he said he would love to go.
he'd love to go.
Oh, I'd love to go.
I'd love to... If you could just...
I'd love, love, love to go.
Oh, I'd love to go! Come here.
say "uncle." - Uncle.
uncle who? - Uncle Martini!
kiss my ass, Mr. Shaham.
kiss my ass, Mr. Estes.
kiss my ass, Ms. Johnson.
kiss my ass, Mr. Rosenthal.
shit.
Hey! What's up with my shooter, twerp face.
target practice.
it's 11 a. m. in the morning for Chris sakes.
most people are doing cartwheels by 11, Kile.
aren't you supposed to be in school?
fuck school.
I don't see you in school.
and besides, you're not Dad.
come here.
come here!
Yeah, you're right, I'm not Dad.
dad didn't yank as hard as I do.
I don't really want to hear about Dad, you understand?
you understand? - Yes.
now, hand me my gun.
look, stupid.
you ever take this without my permission again,
I guarantee it, you'll be sorry.
you understand? - Yeah.
you get it? - Yes.
kiss my ass, Kile.
things to say to Sam on our date.
one.
so...
Sam, it's a beautiful day, isn't it?
two.
are you happy or sad that we're leaving Rollins next year?
three.
so, what's your father do for a living again?
Oh, he has a car-stereo company.
do you believe in God?
that's a weird question.
so, what's it like being a male?
OK, stupid question.
my name is George.
this is the inside of my mind.
this is my mother.
my mom works out every day.
and this is my street.
this is the street I live on.
what are we doing? - You're gonna like this.
isn't that George Tooney?
Yeah, he's coming to the river with us.
Why? - Sammy, don't you tell your girlfriend nothing?
what's he talking about, Sam? - You should've told her, Sam.
all right, everyone. He's coming. Be nice to him.
Millie, it's supposed to be part of the surprise. We...
happy birthday, Sammy.
Hi, George. Glad you could make it.
you know everybody?
Yeah, sure. Hey, everybody. - Hey.
what's happening, George? - Hey, Georgie.
Hi, George. - Hey, Millie.
we ready?
what are you doing? - Making a documentary.
of what? - Of things.
like Sam opening his present. Go ahead and open it.
Yeah, Sam, go ahead and open it.
you already opened all your other presents at home.
stream Machine's top of the line.
I have one at home, so we can have a war sometime.
lsn't it excellent? - Oh, yeah, thank you, George.
you must've blown your whole allowance on that thing, huh, George?
how much you bagging a week now, 40, 50 bucks?
it's very sweet of you, George.
I got it at Funco.
you can return it if you want. - Oh, no, it's perfect.
well...
...It's a beautiful day for a boat trip with some buddies.
Hey, Marty?
my mom made me sign one of those contracts.
it's just, like... You know, I'm not allowed to get in a car with a driver - who's been drinking. - Oh, it's cool.
my mom gave me permission to drink and drive.
you don't have to worry about it. - Your mom must be pretty stupid to give you permission to drive inebriated.
no, you're right, George. My mom is pretty stupid.
in fact, she's got one of those learning-disability things.
must be a bad LD.
I have an LD, but I should know you're not supposed to drive drunk.
I see stuff all backwards and shit.
like, instead of seeing "stop" on a stop sign,
I see "pots.
my doctor says it's a genetic variation, like for evolution.
so maybe I'm a superior being.
the future of the race.
like, if aliens came down and they had a...
a language, a super-advanced language, that said you had to read this way to that way, instead of that way to this way.
shit.
yo, kidlings.
what are you guys doing here?
eating mini beef tacos.
finest mini beef tacos in the world here.
yummy.
what, did you steal Mom's car again?
why do you care? - I don't give a fuck.
who's the minors?
it's just my brother and some of his friends.
what are the paddles for?
we're going cow spanking.
cow spanking, what's that?
it's like cow tipping, only we spank.
really.
come on, let's just get the smokes and get out of here.
camels.
while you boys are out cow spanking,
kile and I are gonna go pussy hunting.
good for you, Jasper. - Hey, don't get sassy with my boy.
you ever been pussy hunting?
no, I didn't think so.
you know how I knew?
because you gotta have some bait to catch one.
that's great.
grow up, Jasper. Let's go, Marty.
Jesus, Jasper. Why do you have to...?
dumb fucks.
why do you have to act so retarded?
have fun cow spanking, boys.
Oh, man. That was awesome. - You see that shit?
so whose road is this? - It's just a road.
Hey, you guys ever hear about when Rocky and l were kicking it out here?
we got some poison oak on our hands.
this is a disgusting story.
anyway, so we were out here, and we got some poison oak on our hands.
with all the beers we were drinking, well, naturally, we had to take a piss.
now, I don't know if you're hip, Millie, but when a guy pisses, he has to hold his pisser in his hands.
like so. - Thanks, Marty.
no, wait, I'm not finished yet.
next morning when we woke up, we both had totally chapped, rash-y nuts.
Hey, lucky you didn't run out of toilet paper, have to wipe your butt with your hand.
Ouch, ouch! I just got stung by something.
you all right? - Yeah.
you guys just go ahead.
better make sure it's not a tick.
Lyme's disease, you know.
look, all right, there'll be three circles around the bite if it's Lyme's disease.
but, like, you gotta watch out because you could just straight drop dead from Lyme's disease.
Thanks, George.
Oh, if it is a tick and it gets dug in, we might need to take my tweezers and, like, put it under a flame until it gets, like, red hot, and then burn the thing to death so it'll let go before we pull it out.
can you leave us alone for a second?
Thanks.
seems like George is having a good time.
what are you trying to say, Clyde?
fat boy's gonna get what he's got coming.
I don't see a stinger.
Sam, what's going on here with George?
Oh, it's nothing bad. It's just a joke.
what kind of joke?
well...
...we're planning on stripping him, throwing him in the river, and then we're gonna make him run home naked.
we have a plan. It involves a dare. - A dare?
Yeah. See, the only reason I didn't tell you before...
who said I wanted to be part of this?
all right, what about this?
what's that?
lf you could snap your fingers right now, "and he would drop dead in his tracks, would you do it?
it's totally mean, Sam. - He's mean.
he's a stupid fat kid.
he's got problems.
but he's obviously...
promise me you won't do anything to him.
it's not just me.
promise, or I go back to the car.
all right, I promise.
I'll tell Rocky.
can't wait to get her on the river and start paddling.
Hey, Rock, you wanna go untie us? - Sure.
there any life jackets? - No, I don't think we'll need them.
come on, sweetheart. Gotta learn to live life on the edge.
he doesn't smoke, Marty.
why don't you speak for yourself, faggot?
I gotta keep my eye on you.
these are really strong.
come on, Rock, he's not such a bad guy.
he's acting like a nice guy, Sam.
in reality, he's not.
you a...
you a cigarette virgin, George?
no. No, I'm not, man.
I've smoked before.
I... No, I once cold smoked an entire pack of American Spirit Menthols.
Oh, yeah? - Yeah.
what if I told you American Spirit doesn't make menthols?
they don't?
it's OK if you've never smoked before, George. I never have.
well, I have. All right, I'm not lying.
you know, maybe they weren't menthols, but they were definitely - American Spirits. - Right.
the only reason why he's being nice to us is because he sees this as an opportunity to get something.
to get friends. Everybody wants that.
OK, what if you were his friend, Sam?
I mean, he'd still go around school, beating everybody else up.
and that's actually if you'd be his friend.
I don't care what you say. I don't wanna do it.
Millie thinks it's a bad idea too. -Oh, well, if Millie thinks...
Millie thinks what's a bad idea? - Nothing.
you pansies untie the knot yet?
chop, chop, come on.
Hey.
Hey, Rock, you know, I got a knife that'll slice through that like butter.
that's OK, George.
I think we got it.
well, it's got, like, a bone saw, scissor, pick ax, I mean, everything.
it's OK, George.
OK.
I'll talk to Marty about it, OK?
give me your oar.
nice. - Thank you, George.
Yeah, I once skipped a rock on this lake, it skipped, like, a thousand times.
let's get her in the water.
aye, aye, Capitan.
calling off the plan. I'll tell you later.
it's all taken care of.
Hey! You guys should take your shoes off if you don't want to get them wet.
too late. They're soaked.
this is gonna be fun, don't you think?
Yeah. But whoever didn't bring life jackets on a boat trip's a moron.
Hey, you know I have athlete's foot?
get in. - You are so disgusting.
Oh, my gosh.
row, two, three, four!
Sam loves it, don't you lie
rocky is a pimp
Clyde is a fag
Yeah, you love it, don't you?
he spit all over the lens.
shut up, Rocky, this is what's gonna get me on MTV.
you need go-go dancers.
this is expensive.
OK, now you have to stop.
send your donations to George Tooney, Oregon.
love one.
I always thought I was really talented in that sense.
you agree, right? Up top. Maybe later.
I'm glad the way this day's turning out.
it's a nice day.
Yeah, if nothing else, it's a nice day.
can you guys taste how sweet the air is?
smells like cherry blossom.
how do you know what cherry blossoms smell like, George?
it's obvious.
I don't know.
what is a cherry blossom?
it's the blossom on a cherry.
no, I thought it was its own kind of plant.
what do you think, Marty?
I think I'm bored as fuck.
I also think I got some more beer in my pack.
anyone want one? - Yeah.
you drinking, Sammy? - Yeah, sure.
I thought you... Didn't you want a beer?
Hey, Sammy.
if you're really feeling like a party animal...
...you wanna smoke a birthday doobie?
Sam doesn't smoke weed, Marty.
rocky, chill out. - There's younger people - on this trip, Marty. - All right, fuck-face, calm down.
I've been stoned before. - Oh, yeah?
Yeah. Yeah. I smoked a whole blunt myself once. Yup.
I... I hallucinated that there was...
there was a little blue guy on my shoulder, fucking tap dancing.
but, no, I don't smoke weed after that, because, like, my doctor says it stunts your growth.
so I'm waiting until I'm 24. - Yeah.
because, you know, that's when you stop growing.
have you ever been stoned, Millie?
would you please get that out of my face?
all right, go ahead, turn it off.
sure is a beautiful river.
Oh, you guys, look!
what? - What?
what?
I thought I saw a water snake.
Sam.
Millie.
Thanks.
here. - Thanks.
all that boating really gets your appetite up.
you've just been sitting in the boat.
I've been shifting my weight the whole time, trying to keep us level.
Yeah, you've really been working hard.
as if your pussy ass has been doing anything.
did you make these yourself?
you'll... You'll have to give me the recipe sometime.
it's peanut butter and jelly.
Oh, yeah.
nothing beats a good piss in the river.
except, of course, a good romping session of a stupid, ugly, dumb, pathetic piece of shit.
Yeah, we gotta talk about that. - Yeah?
what's to talk about?
I want to call it off.
I'm not laughing.
I'm dead serious.
wait a minute.
first, you get me all juiced up.
you make me steal my mom's car.
you get me out here on a Saturday when I could be at home watching TV.
Marty, come on. - Then you have me steering the fucking Titanic all across the river with a bunch of munchkins who are totally sober and bringing me down.
now, you mean to tell me we don't even get to do what we came out here for?
I had no idea the guy was gonna turn out so nice.
check it out, Rock, he's not nice!
he's a spoiled, retarded punk who beat up your brother.
OK, maybe I feel a little sorry for him now.
OK, well, then I'm gonna give you two choices:
you're either hard as hell and you're yanking my chain, or you're the limpest dick I've ever met in my life.
everyone wants to call it off. - Well, everyone is a vagina!
you don't even have a real grudge against him.
if you were any kind of a good brother, you wouldn't let Sammy boy get the shit kicked out of him and then stroke the beater-upper's dick all day long.
just remember the plan's off. - Yeah.
I just wonder if, when push came to shove, if you'd have my back.
Hey, Clyde.
remember when you were in the fourth grade, and I was in third, and l...
I smacked you across the face with a bat?
how could I forget? - Maybe you had that thing where you forget from getting hit in the head.
amnesia? - Yeah.
anyway, I was trying to remember.
why'd I do it? - I don't know.
you must've done something.
no, I never do anything to anybody.
that's stupid. Of course you do.
look, it's not stupid, George. You just attacked me.
a kid doesn't just attack for no reason.
you always attack for no reason.
I know it's your birthday, Sam, but shut your trap.
Hey! You pussies done with your sammies?
does it look like we're done with our sandwiches?
Yeah, I'm gonna get the boat back in the water.
you ladies can join me whenever you want.
why'd you drop the anchor?
because I felt like it.
Hey, Sammy.
what you say we bust out that Stream Machine.
Yeah, OK. - Clyde, can you give it to me?
all right.
put that away.
all right, first, we must charge the propulsion system.
and then take aim and run a preliminary test.
fire! Fire! Fire! Fire!
don't fucking squirt that thing at me again!
Hey, what do you guys say we play some Truth or Dare?
Yeah. Yeah, I love that game.
OK, then, let's do it. - Let's not.
people's feelings always end up hurt when we play this game.
Yeah, she's right.
God, Sam and Millie are a couple of little wet pussies, aren't they?
Clyde, do you wanna start?
I don't know. I'm kind of with Millie and Sam on this one.
pussy number one, pussy number two, pussy number three.
go ahead, Clyde. Start the game.
OK, then.
rocky, truth or dare?
truth.
all right, I want you to tell us, in 20 words or more, what you were thinking the last time you beat off.
Susie Johnson.
but that's... That's not even 20 words.
it's, like, two.
OK, I imagined that she followed me into the locker room, went into the stall.
she got on her knees. I sat on the toilet.
that's 20. - All right, Rocky, it's your turn.
OK, Sammy. Truth or dare?
dare.
I dare you to French kiss Millie for ten seconds.
man.
it's pretty exciting.
it's OK. - What? It's OK.
wait, did you hear that? It's OK.
she wants it.
this is what I paid for? Come on!
come on! - Let's go!
I want my money back.
OK. There you go.
there you go! Ten.
nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...
Oh, shit. Oh, man.
yo, Rock. Rock, I just had an amazing flash of what your brother and Millie would look like all hot and bothered in bed.
that's gross. - Sammy, go. It's your turn.
wait, wait, maybe... Maybe we shouldn't call him Sammy anymore.
maybe we should call him "lover boy.
OK, then.
Marty.
truth or dare? - Dare.
all right.
I dare you to pull down your pants and your underwear, and show us that famous dick of yours for at least ten seconds.
ten seconds. Wow, you are a killer, Sam.
all right, I will do it, because I am proud of my boys. But if I do,
I don't want anyone else wimping out on their dares.
so let's see the penis.
bring on the penis! - All right.
Millie, close your eyes. Marty doesn't want to go to jail.
no cameras.
we ready?
that's sick.
fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! - Oh! OK. OK.
all right. You fucking asshole.
it was hairy as a chimp! - Yeah, was it?
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
it looked like a giant frog.
all right, assholes. That was pretty funny, douche bag.
at first I thought it was all deformed, - Thank you.
because it was just so fucking ugly. - OK. All right.
have you gotten out all your stupid chuckles yet?
have I gotten out all my stupid chuckles? No!
all right. Well, whenever you're done, let me know, because it's my turn next.
whenever you're done, let me know, because it's my turn next.
what are you doing? - Yeah, well, what are you doing?
stop imitating me. - "Stop imitating me.
enough is enough! - "Enough is enough!
is that what your dad says to you?
you don't know shit about my father.
if you ever say anything about my father again, I will kill you.
do you understand?
Marty, l...
I was just messing around with you.
OK, messing boy.
I dare you to strip butt naked and jump in the river.
Marty, leave him alone.
I did my dare.
now he does his. Those are the rules, Clyde.
Marty, why don't you just calm down?
OK, the game's over. - The game'll be over in a minute!
right after fat-ass here takes his clothes off and gets in the bath.
chill out, Marty, all right?
because you know what? I didn't even pick dare, all right?
I pick truth.
you want a truth?
OK, I'll give you a truth.
the truth is, lard-fart, is that we didn't invite you out here because we've been secretly in love - with you all these years. - Marty, don't do this.
we invited you out here because you smacked Sammy boy - right there in the cranium. - Marty, stop.
so we came up with a plan to mess you up.
is that true, Sam?
Yeah.
but then we changed our minds because we liked you.
wait, you...? You tricked me?
Yes, we tricked you.
and, yes, all these suckers here changed their minds, but I didn't change mine.
I'm a man who likes to follow through with his plans.
what have you been planning?
we were planning on stripping you, throwing you in the river, then making you run home naked.
it's not funny. - Oh, it's super-duper funny to me.
I'm sorry, George. - You're not sorry!
I'm sorry.
is...? Is it even your birthday?
no.
you're a fucking lying son of a bitch, Sam!
all right? And I hope you fucking go to hell!
don't make things worse, George. - Shut the fuck up, Millie.
you fucking stupid JAP cunt!
sit down, George. You're out of control.
shut the fuck up, Clyde! You faggot!
fucking skinny, butt-munching faggot!
I hate you, you know that? I really do!
because all you do is fucking prance around school, talking about your fucking faggoty, fairy fathers!
I'll tell you what! I don't want to hear about your fucking fathers and how their assholes work.
all right? It makes me sick!
and l... I fucking hope they fucking die of fag disease!
Yeah!
and... And speaking of dead fathers...
...I just remembered why bonehead, white-trash, fucking donkey-dick Marty got so fucking freaked when I started talking about his daddy.
his Neanderthal drunk dad put a gun in his mouth and splattered his brains all over the wall.
you know, I almost forgot that my mom told me that.
she said, "His daddy splattered his brains all over the wall.
I thought it was sad at first. But, now, I like it.
his daddy splattered his brains all over the wall.
his daddy splattered his brains - Shut up, George.
all over the wall. - George, come on. Shut up.
his daddy splattered his brains all over the wall!
stop it, George! - All over the wall!
his daddy splattered his brains - No one talks to people like that.
all over the wall! - Shut the fuck up, George!
shut the fuck up! - All over the wall!
all over the wall! His daddy splattered his brains - Shut up! - All over the wall!
Marty! - Stop it!
Marty! George! - All over the wall!
shut the fuck up!
help! Help! - That's what happens when you fuck with Martini Blank!
help, help! Please! - Martini Blank's friends back him up.
that's what friends do, fuck-o. - Help!
help! Help! Help! - That's why you're in the water.
because you've got none. - Help! Fucker!
help!
help! Help!
help! Help!
please help.
shit, you guys, he's not coming up!
help!
guys, help, now! Hurry!
get him up.
George.
Oh, shit. - Do you know what you're doing?
one, two, three, four...
help!
help!
help!
can anyone help us?
help! - One, two, three, four.
one, two, three, four.
come on.
wake up. Come on, wake up!
wake up.
shit.
wake up!
wake up!
wake up! God, wake up!
wake up, wake up, wake up!
wake up, wake up!
wake up! Wake up, wake up, wake up!
wake up!
fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
we can never be forgiven for what we did.
you didn't do anything.
I don't wanna be here.
I don't wanna be here.
I wanted to kill him before I threw him over. Now he's dead.
maybe this was his time to go.
maybe it was his fate.
why would it be his fate?
because everything happens for a reason, Rock.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
anybody know what time it is?
what if we say we were playing Truth or Dare, and then we dared him to jump into the river, and he did, and he drowned.
what the hell are you doing?
looking for his fucking video camera.
if it gets found, then everybody finds out what we did.
everyone's gonna find out what we did, regardless if the video camera gets found, Marty.
not if we don't want them to.
are you joking?
look, this was a prank that went wrong. We come completely clean.
no one's got a ton of sympathy for guys who throw fat kids in the river.
all right? If we turn ourselves in, we're all screwed.
what do you think's gonna happen, Marty?
Superman's gonna fly around Earth and turn back time?
no. I don't think Superman's going to turn back time.
think we gotta bury the body.
rocky, if we bury the body, it's gonna look like we did it on purpose.
if we bury the body, we're not gonna look like anything.
out of sight, out of mind.
Yeah, well, maybe out of your mind, you stupid fuck.
look, we just committed a major fucking crime.
and if any one of us cracks, we are all gonna be screwed.
look, it was an accident. Kids like us have accidents all the time.
this wasn't just an accident.
all right? We schemed this, from the beginning.
all right, so fine, we schemed. No one has to know that.
they're gonna figure it out.
somebody's bound to crack when they start asking a million questions.
put Sammy boy in a lie detector.
look, the idea of burying the body is nuts.
going to jail and getting raped every night for the rest of your cute, little, fucking lives is nuts.
I think you're nuts.
so that's it?
we're just gonna pretend like we're all innocent.
shut up. - No.
shut up. - No!
if you've got a better idea, then you better spit it out - because no one else does. - Marty, come on.
do you have one? - Shit, Marty. Get off. Come on.
if you've got a better idea, I'll listen. Do you?
no. - Then do you agree that we have to go with the best idea we've got?
Yes. Get off.
you always gotta go with the best idea you've got.
otherwise you're just left
laying around not knowing what to do.
I can't do it.
it's not safe.
it's a big joke anyway.
I think that's deep enough.
Hey, you guys wanna help?
first thing we gotta do when we get back is deal with Jasper and my brother.
how?
gotta make sure they forget they ever saw George with us.
what the fuck you gonna do? Huh?
hit them over the head with a rock, hope they get amnesia?
Thanks.
all right, this is the way it's gonna work.
we drop everybody off at their houses.
everybody's gonna sit tight until I go make sure everything's "copathetic" with Kile and Jasper.
the word's copacetic, Marty.
Yeah.
Millie...
...mum's the word.
peg, can I get the phone?
shit.
Kile? - Hey, Marty, - What's cooking? - Hey, you little fucker.
how'd the cow spanking go?
what?
looks fantastic.
you OK?
you look a little...
no, I'm fine.
Clyde, if something's up, it's OK to tell us about it.
this is so fucked.
fuck!
I don't even know...
I don't even know.
Hey.
maybe you guys could take me home?
wish we knew what to do.
we know what to do.
you know what we did, Rocky.
what are you trying to say, Sam?
you have to trust me on this one, Sam.
I'm your big brother.
but I don't trust you.
where you going?
what do you want?
to talk.
we have nothing to talk about.
it was your guys' plan. I was just there.
that doesn't mean I have to tell on you.
and that's your problem.
are you done?
can I come in?
do you remember when you said we could never be forgiven?
that might be right.
I don't know.
the only thing I do know is that I'm not sure about anything.
what do you want us to do?
go back and unbury the body?
he's dead.
you know...
...when we graduate high school and go to college and become doctors and lawyers and all that...
...what do you think it'd be like?
Hey. - Hey, Marty.
good to see you. - How you doing, Mr. Maris?
how are you? - I'm good.
are...? Is Rocky and Sam home?
Oh, yeah, yeah. The whole gang's here.
they're listening to music in the bedroom there.
do you mind if...? Thanks. - Yeah, yeah.
what's going on here?
why don't you sit down?
what, so I go off to make sure all our business is taken care of, and all of a sudden you guys form a new club?
we've come to a decision. - You've come to a decision?
what, are you kidding me?
we already decided. I talked to Jasper and Kile.
they're not gonna say anything.
everything is going to be OK.
no. Everything is not gonna be OK.
so, what?
all you guys decide to squeal or something?
we have to, Marty. It's the only way...
no, there is no "only way," Sam. That's crap.
OK? You know that's crap.
all right.
screw all of you, then.
Marty, hang on. - No!
where you going? - Away from you.
you suck.
you know that, right?
what are you gonna do? - I don't know, drive to Mexico.
what do you think?
I don't know what to think.
well, if you don't know what to think, then you probably shouldn't be making decisions.
what do you think about letting me borrow your gun?
Hey. - Yeah.
easy, man.
he was saying terrible things.
things that shouldn't have been said.
when your brother knocked George overboard...
...would you say he was in control or out of control?
you got something for me? - Yeah.
excuse me, Sam.
never seen him more out of control in my life.
my name is George,
and this...
...is the inside of my mind,
the inside of my mind has a zillion things,
the inside of my mind has a zillion things about it,
but...
...people that don't see inside my mind don't know there are a zillion things and...
you know, since no one sees inside my mind, no one really knows,
but...
...one day people will know,
one day people will know because that's my master plan,
to film it all,
to document every aspect of the life that is me,
and put it in a time capsule in my back yard,
and so that one day, some...
...alien, or some highly evolved species, will find it and...
understand.
previously
you fucking bastard!
you fucking...
where is it now?
that's not what I put in there, dad!
that's not what I put it in there!
Jack Donnelly was strangled to death.
someone's trying to make it look like a revenge killing.
did you hear that Wintersgill arrested someone for Donnelly's murder?
who?
I'm your guardian angel, Eddie.
protecting them, like I've always done.
I had a stupid fling. It didn't mean anything.
I had no idea Danny wasn't the father.
with the right mix of charm and persuasion and appropriate encouragement...
trust me.
it's what I do best.
what's the truth about you?
who are you really?
I mean, what exactly is it that you do, Samantha?
what's meadowlands for?
ask that bitch about cape wrath.
Hello, mate.
we're here to see Samantha.
Yeah. She's, uh...
we're in the same situation as you, vis-a-vis samantha.
so where is she?
away.
something wrong, mate?
Yeah.
cape wrath.
sorry, mate, you got me there.
Yeah.
fuck.
consider this analogy.
mind is to brain, as walking is to legs.
thus, if I embark on an intense program of running and weight training, if I alter the muscular construction of my legs, it will certainly change the way I walk.
and so, our understanding of neurological function will, and I'm certain of this, allow us to similarly intervene in brain function.
now, can this-- will this-- alter our minds?
alter our sense of being?
tune in next week for the answer.
dad.
Evelyn, hi.
how are you today?
Yeah, I'm good, thanks.
good. Good, good, good.
this arrived yesterday.
you can borrow if you'd like. It's--it's absolutely amazing.
Sinatra, live at the sands, 1966.
his 50th birthday.
I just thought it might cheer you up.
cheer me up?
Yes, well, I--I know you've probably had a bit of a sleepless night, and, uh...
well, I--I just wanted to reassure you.
our secret is absolutely and, er, unconditionally safe.
thank you, David.
I think I'd better get on.
of course.
Oh, er, Evelyn?
yeah?
Oh, I've seen it.
Thanks, though.
I wanted to to discover the soul.
you know, consciousness, our sense of self, the strange deep thoughts we have.
what is it in here? In amongst all the neurons and synapses and biochemical events that produces something like John Coltrane's Love Supreme, Guernica, Buster Keaton -
dad, I've come a long way.
excuse me.
Yeah.
how? How does he know?
hang on. We need to fully assess.
OK. Set it in motion.
I'm on my way back.
we're on.
tumor.
the size of an orange.
I'm going to die, Samantha.
how did you get in?
picked the lock, mate.
I'm kind of, er, fly that way.
you know, wide, sharp, street, fly.
is that right, fred? - Oh, I'd prefer you not to call me that.
Oh, sorry, Freddie.
you don't like me, do you?
I don't know you.
well, maybe you should loosen up and get to know me.
I'd love that, yeah.
get to know all about you.
what's to know?
I'm not the fly-by-night guy you take me for.
do you want to stop doing that?
sorry.
I didn't know you feared intimacy.
when's samantha back?
I don't know.
you know, you'll find that door unlocks from the inside.
look, I have contacts through my work.
I can get access to specialists.
this isn't a death sentence.
Samantha, aside from a miracle there are only two options.
as in having my ass wiped several times a day by strangers due to clinical incontinence, I'll be in pain, the kind of relentless 24-hour pain that will suck the will to live from me.
it will sap the life out of you as you watch me die.
it will.
and this is why brought you here.
to say good-bye.
spikes only on the practice green, please.
golf, not life, eh?
what happened, Tom?
well, I 3-putted on 7 greens this morning. - No, no. I mean yesterday.
was it Freddie? Did he do something to you?
the past is not another country.
it's another planet.
good morning.
what?
you have something I want.
youth? Intelligence? Breasts?
the files.
I binned them.
well, unbin them and get them back to me by the end of play today, please.
Yes, sir.
where?
when?
I don't know.
when the pain becomes too much to bear.
counseling.
maybe you should talk to someone, a professional.
Oh, for god's sakes, Samantha.
I've spent the last 30 years proving beyond doubt, I'd say, that psychology is bollocks.
anyway, I have you to talk to.
but I'm not.
I'm not equipped.
I'm no good at emotional things.
problems at work?
I can't talk about that. It's classified.
so, I formulate a theory about you and your crony.
cape wrath is not a weapon.
so why did I get cut out?
just because I happen to think.
dad, we have other issues here!
my death is not the issue.
it's my life that's the issue, - and my life's wo-- - and your life's work.
is that why you brought me here?
to insure the safety of your legacy?
no.
I mean...
I'm in the waiting room here.
classified is not applicable.
so, come on, talk to me about it.
please.
that was...sextastic.
sextastic. You are sextastic.
socks. Socks.
do you mind?
sorry, babes.
babes?
God, I've created a monster.
kids, eh?
what do you do?
I mean, it's like he's grown up overnight.
the gloves are gone.
it's amazing. - Yeah.
he just needs to get rid of that stupid haircut and we're on family fortunes.
what does he want to spend so much time at Jezebel's for, anyway?
wouldn't you if you were him?
she is the most beautiful creature in meadowlands.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Hello?
who is it?
Frank Sinatra.
live at sands.
eh?
nothing.
I've got to go.
you know Dr. York prescribed three shags a day after meals?
better complete the course, hadn't we?
there's a fly in here.
we got any fly spray?
no, I'll pick some up.
I'll see you later. Yeah?
Yeah.
fuck.
what the hell do you think you're playing at?
excuse me?
that phone call to my house, Frank Sinatra.
look, David, I know that you did me a favor, and I really appreciate it, but that doesn't give you the right to start interfering in my marriage.
Oh, yeah, I see what's happening here.
what do you mean?
you're trying to demonize me. - What?
displace your own past mistakes onto me.
Evelyn, I did not call you at home. All right?
I happen to like your husband.
he seems like a decent man.
and do you know what? I respect the sanctity of your marriage, - and I could never violate that. - Well, who was it then?
Hello?
Hi.
Er...it's Abigail.
do you mind? We'd like some privacy.
sorry.
Hi.
uh, nothing.
OK. Bye.
we've called the community meadowlands.
after the old holiday home.
well, how do you keep the-- uh, I almost said subjects, the residents -
how to keep the residents in situ?
Ditches?
electrified fences?
armed guards?
fear.
every resident is on a witness relocation program.
good. Very good. Very good.
never off duty, eh?
we can't talk about cape wrath without talking about Una.
she's the experimental proof your theories of mind work.
if you hadn't found Una, assigned her.
I know what I did.
well, if you hadn't been successful in what you did, cape wrath couldn't exist.
where are you going with this, Samantha?
it's taking longer than I thought.
the whole process.
if cape wrath is going to work, I need more on Una.
files, data, medical records, your diaries of the process.
it's not relevant.
why do you always shut me out of this?
because this meadowlands place is not like Una.
you're dealing with fully mature adults.
with lives, with file upon file of episodic memories.
una was four years old.
get back.
her parents were psychologically deranged.
the child was kept in a box in total darkness from birth.
when they brought her to me, she was without sentience.
no concept of her self, no concept of time.
no feelings.
no empathy.
nothing.
she had a brain but no mind.
and you created a mind. - Samantha, I have to protect Una.
from what?
from me.
what I did with her-- did to her...
I'm not sure it was ethical.
fuck!
fly me to the moon, let me fly...
nice ones, huh?
I need you to help me with her personal development program.
ding-dong. Who's that?
I know him from somewhere.
no one.
it's nothing.
what are you up to, Zoe Brogan?
you're just one big walking question mark, aren't you?
Hi, girls.
what have you been up to, Markie?
you're never in the house anymore.
got a girlfriend or something?
a girlfriend?
no.
you have, haven't you?
I haven't.
I've got a class.
you have something of mine.
Yeah, I do.
I've got it here.
the past is not another planet.
it's a file.
memories.
the real you.
the man I kissed.
I know what you think you are, Zoe.
you think you're cool and gorgeous and funny and caring and strong, but what you are is tormented.
meadowlands is the kind of place that can make that torment stop.
now, I just came to tell you that you should return that to Mr. Wintersgill.
if it's David you're after, he's gone for a coffee.
alone.
do you think David's a homosexual?
no.
I mean, I don't know.
Oh, look, Abigail.
no, I know you don't want to get involved in someone else's marriage.
but you are involved.
aren't you?
you know about me and Jack Donnelly.
Yeah. Jack Donnelly was an aberration and
what am I supposed to do, Evelyn?
david finds me repellent.
Oh, god, Abigail, look, will it--would it help if we went shopping together?
that would be lovely, Evelyn.
stay away from Freddie.
Oh, what's this, Bernard?
you're supposed to do law and order around here and not spend your time protecting the likes of Freddie.
it's not Freddie I'm trying to protect.
open the door!
what's up, Danny? I'm busy.
nimble, quick and over the candlestick, eh?
twice today, some joker has phoned me up and played Frank Sinatra down the phone.
it was you, wasn't it?
Danny, this irrational obsession with me you seem to have developed, it's a symptom of some deeper malaise.
now, come on.
what exactly is your problem?
cape wrath.
Oh, that.
well, to be frank, it's bothering all of us that Jack's dead.
what are you talking about, eh?
who said anything about Jack being dead?
you.
I just asked you what was bothering you, and you said,"Jack's dead."
I said cape wrath was bothering me.
look, mate, we're all upset that jack's dead. Ok?
but we've got to put it behind us as a community.
I mean, I know I'm good, but I can't coax the deceased back to life.
tell me, Fred, why are you such a sniveling, little pain in the ass, eh?
never off-duty, are you?
or out with your mates.
what are you lacking?
eh, Fred?
hands.
so...
let's get inside your head.
delete a few files.
let jack out of the box.
thank you very much.
so...
well, how could it not?
that'll look gorgeous on you.
you're really good at this, aren't you?
clothes and shopping.
used to run a part-time business, me and a mate.
Restylists, we called ourselves.
all these rich women with no taste.
what not to wear?
you know what to fleece, more like.
Oh, sorry. The past.
if you want to reinvent yourself, meadowlands is the place.
Ah, this is lovely, isn't it?
I think David might actually notice me in this.
didn't I buy that?
Oh.
OK.
sorry.
you keep it.
I'll get another one.
we'll sort it out.
you sure?
Yeah, it'll look lovely on you.
thank you, Evelyn.
you know, I don't care what people say.
you are a nice person.
excuse me. Waiter?
another bottle of wine, please.
not for me, dad.
Oh, relax, Samantha.
it's not every day I get drunk with my daughter.
do you have someone?
a boyfriend?
a lover?
not really.
do you know what I've missed about you?
the school walks.
you were always there to walk me to and from school.
no one else's dad did that.
when you were small...
it was so funny.
venetian blinds.
you used to call them vanishing blinds.
can I tell you something?
even when I learned the right word, I used to use the wrong one just to make you laugh.
I've never seen you smile like that.
it's like you really feel it.
in here.
daddy.
excuse me.
Hiya!
you ok, Danny?
Yeah, I'm fine.
listen, Brenda.
you ever heard of a something called Jack Wrath?
Jack what? - Don't worry.
what's going on in this place, Brenda?
come on. Eh?
you've been here a while, you must have some idea.
look, Danny, meadowlands is a brilliant place.
I'm happy here.
jezebel is happy here.
Yes. I know. You're happy.
and you know how I know you're happy?
cause you keep telling me you're happy.
is that what's going on with Mark, eh?
is that why he's always in your house?
jezebel's trying to convince him to be happy?
I'm going to have a word with him about that.
erm, no, listen, I--I'll talk to Jezebel.
I'll put a stop to it, ok?
Danny, leave it with me.
at least let me open the bar before you start spending the profits.
sorry, darling. Got a bit carried away.
you know how I am.
Yeah. I do.
what's that supposed to mean?
every time I've gotten in front, got some money in the bank, you're always upping the lifestyle. Aren't you?
off with the credit card and your secret spending. - Oh, piss off!
I thought we got past all of this.
anyway, it's not as if you don't keep secrets from me.
what, and you tell me everything?
Christ, I am allowed a little bit of space in here that's my own, you know?
I walk about out there, it's like you're cornered?
I'm sorry. It's just this place, you know.
these people, they are climbing about inside my head.
I'm out of here.
every life is a tale.
a necessary fiction, with a beginning, a middle, and an end.
and my story ended with that diagnosis.
but it doesn't matter, Samantha.
steady, professor.
Ah, you're drunk.
really drunk.
don't move.
excuse me...
no way.
no way.
come on!
underneath the moonlight.
you know what this is?
this is the closest thing to my last wish.
your last wish being?
to dance with you at your wedding.
what are you doing...to me?
what is all this about?
I don't know what you mean.
trying to get inside my head.
like you're trying to convert me.
I thought you cared about me.
I did.
I do.
but only on my terms.
you mean on meadowlands' terms?
Yeah.
thank you.
dad, you ok?
Mm. I'm fine.
er, where are your painkillers?
jacket pocket.
I'm fine. I'm fine. - It's all right. I've got them.
dad?
no.
I did it in the restaurant. - No.
we should get a taxi.
I need an ambulance.
now!
um...I'm on the--dad!
this is what I want.
I've made my decision.
Oh, you've made your decision?
what? You're just going to go like that?
just now, without even-- - It is the right time.
Why? Why is it the right time?
because your legacy is safe? Is that it?
because cape wrath is up and running, what?
it is my child.
no, dad! I'm your child.
Oh, christ. - What?
look...
it's the right time because when you smiled in the restaurant, you felt it.
didn't you? Didn't you?
it's the right time.
I feel something like other people do and you say now is the right time to -
because it's done.
it's over with. Ok?
come. Give me your hand. You'll be ok now.
could you all move back, please?
there is nothing to see here.
don't worry, you'll be ok.
come on. Move away, please.
my work is done.
you don't need to be protected.
you're a complete human being.
leave it.
it's a...fire hazard.
I'm the fire hazard.
So...either call the emergency services or dowse me yourself.
Abigail. What-- what are you
Shh.
look, I really don't have time for this and I
call me Evelyn.
I'm Evelyn.
don't be scared, David.
I told you. Get back!
I just need to see her face.
you're going to be safe with us.
we're going to look after you.
I'm not your child.
I wanted to tell you.
I'm Una.
I'm your experiment.
all these years...
I wanted to tell you.
Oh, god, I'm disgusting.
Abigail, I'm sorry.
she said it would make you happy.
who?
who?
every life's a story, eh?
especially mine.
a rigorously executed fiction authored by you.
your face is my first memory.
I've got nothing before that.
well, I get a little uncomfortable in lifts, that's it.
all that time together.
or were you just reconfiguring me?
then what did you have planned?
scoop out my brain, slice it into sections, and see if there was anything of Una in there?
or see if I was totally and utterly your creation?
the fucking bride of frankenstein.
did you ever love me?
yes?
I believe he's ready.
shall I proceed?
what do you think, professor?
episodic memory deletion?
proceed?
or abort?
proceed.
you got it.
good-bye...
dad.
you know what, Fred?
I should kill you.
didn't you try that already?
you're not here!
no way!
you're-- - I'm dead, obviously.
fuck!
I fucking-- - No, you didn't kill me.
I'm not dead. I exist!
I'm fucking
how many more of your fucking sentences do I have to finish?
Hey, get with it, Danny.
this is meadowlands, where your dreams come true and nightmares go away.
shut up! You're not here!
and what you think happened did not happen.
there is no cape wrath!
let it go.
bury it, Danny.
No! No!
Hey, get in here!
Hey! Danny!
so who are you shagging, then?
no one.
Yeah, whatever.
you've changed.
everybody changes.
no, you're different.
why do you want to know?
why do you question everything?
question things?
you do, you question everything.
meadowlands is...a nice, warm pool.
you should jump in.
morning. - Hey.
nice buggy.
carts, not cars.
very you.
thank you.
hello.
it's over, you and me. We're done.
what do you mean? Why? What have I done wrong? Why?
listen, somebody might find out, Mark.
who cares if somebody finds out?
I care! Ok.
it makes me look pathetic. - You're not pathetic.
I did not come to meadowlands -
and I did not go through what I have gone through to look pathetic again.
I'm sorry.
I am what I am, Mark.
I'm my own special creation.
no.
I'm my own special creation, too.
I am.
this really is the best way to see meadowlands, isn't it?
the reassuring whir of the electric engine.
why are you doing this to me?
the old me is gone. Ok?
Yeah, I know.
which is why I'm taking it back to Mr. Wintersgill.
good.
right. Well, I'll see you.
drive slow, homey.
yours, I believe.
Thanks.
straight and true.
thought you had more fight in you than that.
disappointed you've returned those.
don't be, Bernard.
you broke into my office.
there will be a price to pay for that.
no choice. It went wrong. We had to abort.
OK. My call. My problem.
I'll clean up.
business as usual.
Jack's dead because you killed him.
he works for me.
his remit is to help residents settle.
freddie misused his skills.
what did he do to me?
an auto-suggestion technique.
associate something that you know to be true-- jack's dead - with something he wanted you to forget.
cape wrath.
I went along with everything you told me.
I trusted you and you lied to me.
and I want to know why the hell I have brought my family too.
you owe me that.
excuse me.
how stupid do you think I am?
I'm sorry?
accusing me of interfering in your marriage when you have the arrogance to interfere in my marriage?
influencing Abigail into some... - What are you talking about?
I'm talking about you, Evelyn.
who do you think you are? Trying to manipulate people like this?
David, look, I don't understand.
no, no, you don't, do you?
you don't understand that here in meadowlands we try to protect one another.
like, oh, I tried to protect you and your marriage by compromising everything I believed in and lying for you.
David, listen to me.
if I have caused you and Abigail any offense, then I apologize.
I really do-- - You fucking bitch.
meadowlands is part of a program.
the codename is cape wrath.
nature verses nurture.
we're trying to assess the benefits of a benign environment upon the human behavior.
rehabilitation for criminals.
think of it like this, Danny.
witness protection with aftercare.
what, and you covered up something like Jack's death to protect your program, eh?
Yes.
that's it.
that's the truth behind meadowlands.
I don't believe it. - I don't care.
you know too much.
I'm going to have to remove you from the program.
you and Evelyn and the kids.
unless-- - I go back there and forget everything you've told me, eh?
stop digging.
stop asking questions.
Yes.
you see, Danny, out there people betray you.
you have a family here.
people who love you.
and you haven't brought them to hell, you've brought them to heaven.
accept it.
your accelerated process seemed to be an unequivocal failure, which raises the question -
is cape wrath, a white elephant?
do your father's theories work in practice?
Yes.
his theories work.
believe me. They work.
next time
all of our clients get itchy feet after a couple of weeks.
has anyone ever failed to settle in?
what is it that you want?
I want what I deserve.
found what you were looking for?
Yes, I have.
it's not like you're going anywhere, is it?
he's trying to throw us off the scent.
he's pretty determined.
makes two of us.
have sex with me, Evelyn, or I tell Danny the truth.
have you ever felt like you were a little bit different?
like you had something unique to offer the world if you could just get people to see it.
then you know exactly how it felt to be me.
go ahead, Flint.
what is the number one problem facing our community today?
untied shoelaces.
which is why I've invented a laceless alternative foot covering.
spray-on Shoes.
Voilà. - They're so nifty.
how you gonna get them off, nerd?
what a freak. He wants to be smart, but that's lame.
I wanted to run away that day.
but you can't run away from your own feet.
not every sardine is meant to swim, son.
I don't understand fishing metaphors.
what did I say? - Don't worry.
honey, I think your shoes are wonderful.
everyone just thinks I'm a weirdo.
so?
people probably thought that these guys were weirdoes too.
but that never stopped them.
I was saving this for your birthday, but here.
a professional-grade lab coat.
just like the real guys wear.
it fits perfect.
the world needs your originality, Flint.
you just have to grow into it.
and I know that you're gonna do big things someday.
from that moment on...
... I was determined to invent something great.
remote Control Television.
and, the pitch is in.
eventually.
hair Un-Balder.
flying Car.
monkey Thought Translator.
hungry. Hungry. Hungry. - How wise.
no, Steve. No, no, no, no, no! No, please! Leave it...
Ratbirds.
Hey, what's going on, little guy?
flint Lockwood.
my dream was to help my hometown...
... a tiny island hidden under the "A" in "Atlantic..."
... called Swallow Falls.
we were famous for sardines...
... until the day the Baby Brent Sardine Cannery closed for good.
right after everyone in the world realized that sardines...
... are super gross.
soon, all of us were stuck eating the sardines that no one else wanted.
poached, fried, boiled, dried, candied and juiced.
life became gray and flavorless.
but when all seemed lost, I stared at defeat...
... and found hope.
my name is Flint Lockwood.
and I was about to invent a machine...
... that turns water...
... into food.
Steve, my best friend and trusted colleague.
Steve.
can I count on your help?
can.
I knew I could.
button, on. Memory, activate.
blueprints, awesome. Begin nano-mutation.
radiation matrix, secure.
computer, boot.
coolness enhancement, complete.
engage coffee break.
networking power grid.
beginning conversion of water...
...into food.
hydrating protein matrix.
calibrating flavor panel.
priming chow plopper.
uploading cool machine voice.
cheeseburger.
everyone is going to love this.
Flint!
sorry, Dad.
Steve, keep working.
scanning hand.
that's a really weird dude.
re-energizing tower unit.
jeez. See you, Dad.
flint.
don't you think it's time to give up this inventing thing, get a real job?
no, why?
well, all your technology stuff, it just ends in disaster.
the ratbirds, yes, they escaped and bred at a surprising rate.
but I took care of that problem and disposed of them.
Billy, just play dead.
flint, you don't keep throwing your net where there aren't any fish.
what? - I want you to work full-time...
...at the tackle shop. - The tackle shop? Dad, no.
tackle is a good career.
please, I'm so close with this one.
I just have to hook it up to the power station and give it power and it'll work.
and then you could sell food in the shop...
...and then everyone won't have to eat sardines anymore.
it is going to be so awesome.
I'm sorry, son.
no more inventing.
dad, I know I can do this.
and Mom did too.
it had been almost 10 years since Mom died...
... and Dad still didn't understand me like she did.
come on. Let's open the shop.
tim and Son Sardine Bait and Tackle.
you feeling it?
look out, Baby Brent!
baby Brent Sardines.
Hand-packed in Swallow Falls.
as your mayor, I know it's time to put our sardine-canning past behind us...
... and look to the future.
sardine tourism!
that's why, without consulting anyone...
... I spent the entire town budget on the thing that is under this tarp...
... which I will be unveiling today at noon.
featuring a live appearance by Baby Brent himself.
what is up, everybody?
Hey. - Hey, it's Baby Brent.
what you doing? Stacking cans with me on them as a baby?
anyways, who wants to watch me cut the ribbon...
...at the mayor's unveiling thing?
I'll be using these bad boys to help save the town.
all right, you guys. Sardines, yeah.
swallow Falls forever! - What a delight.
listen, you... Maybe you wanna go to that unveiling?
you know, Dad, why don't you go ahead. I'll hold down the fort here.
Really? You sure you can handle it?
Yeah, Dad, I'm pretty sure I'll be fine.
all right, then.
I'll be back in half an hour, skipper.
okay. Bye.
this hellhole is too small for me, Brent.
I wanna be big.
I want people to look at me and say, "That is one big mayor.
and that's why this has to work.
it has to work.
otherwise, I'm just a tiny mayor of a tiny town...
...full of tiny sardine-sucking knuckle-scrapers.
but not me, right?
Oh, not you, Brent. No. You've always been like a son to me.
Hey, everybody.
under this tarp is the greatest tourist attraction ever built by humans.
we just need 17, 000 more gigajoules.
an attraction so... - Go, go, go.
what are you doing, Flint Lockwood?
just holding my hands behind my back respectfully, sir.
you know what you are, Lockwood? - No.
a shenaniganizer.
a tomfool.
you see my beautiful angel son Cal? - What's up?
I love him so much. This is my only son.
I want him to have a bright future.
a future in which you don't ruin our town's day with one of your crazy science thingies.
well, that's all behind me... - You see this contact lens, Lockwood?
this contact lens represent you. - All right.
and my eye represents my eye. - Okay.
I got my eye on you.
Oh, my gosh, a jaywalker. - Hey.
and I've arranged for live coverage from a major network...
...and their most experienced professional reporter.
Oh, just send the intern. She's cute, and she's super perky.
well, those are the only things we look for in a TV weatherperson. Intern.
how would you like to do a weather report from a rinky-dink island in the middle of the ocean as a favor to my cousin?
Really?
can you believe it, Manny?
temporary professional meteorologist.
okay, Manny, what about this?
welcome, America, I'm Sam Sparks.
Hello, America, Sam Sparks here.
america, hi. I didn't see you there.
it's me, Sam Sparks.
on my way across the ocean.
now, when she gets here, I wanna see a lot of smiling faces.
act like, "Hey, whoa."
this is a great idea.
weather News Network.
weather news happens...
... or not.
now we're over to Swallow Falls...
... where our intern is on her first day on the job.
or should I say, first gray on the job.
looks pretty cloudy there, intern.
Hello, Sam Sparks, I'm America.
it's Swallow Falls degrees and... Well, let's just go to the mayor.
thank you and welcome, national television audience.
you are about to witness an historic event, undoubtedly...
and now, here to cut the ceremonial ribbon...
...Swallow Falls' favorite son, Baby Brent!
he's still got it, folks.
I'm the best person in the whole town.
food synthesis, go.
my chest hairs are tingling. Something's wrong.
well, here it is. The attraction the whole world has been waiting for:
sardine Land.
with rides and exhibits.
and featuring Shamo, the world's largest sardine...
...and his flaming hoop of glory.
those of you in the splash zone, look out.
cheeseburger.
flint Lockwood.
just a second. I'm in the middle of a...
well, looks like things in Swallow Falls are sardine to get better. For...
what just happened to me?
sorry.
no.
you're under arrest, Flint Lockwood.
thank goodness you only caused minimal damage to Sardine Land.
come on.
I really shouldn't be running with these.
jump, jump, jump, run, run, jump, jump, run.
it's a good thing no one got hurt! - Flint Lockwood!
I didn't get hurt, but that does not mean that I'm not still mad at you.
Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry. Are you okay?
I didn't get a chance to... - It's okay, it's just pain.
sorry, I'm not myself today.
my whole career was ruined by some crazy jerk riding a homemade rocket.
wait a minute.
what is going on with your feet?
spray-on Shoes. They don't come off.
cool.
this could solve the untied shoes epidemic.
what are they made of, some kind of elastic biopolymer adhesive?
exactly.
I mean...
wow, they're shiny. I'm Sam.
flint. - Steve.
is that a Monkey Thought Translator? - Steve.
incredible. Did you make all of this stuff?
you hit me with a rocket. - You kicked me in the face.
I said I was sorry.
do you know how hard it is to break into the weather game?
I spent my entire life building up to that moment.
you get one shot at the show.
and if you don't make it...
...It's back to cleaning the barometers.
cheese?
but that could only mean...
excited. Excited.
my machine works.
it really works!
your machine?
is that what that rocket was?
do you like it?
I love it!
this is just amazing. Look at this.
this is the greatest weather phenomenon in history.
Hey, aren't you a weathergirl?
Manny, get your camera.
this just in: Our humiliated weather intern is apparently back for more.
Thanks, Patrick. Okay, everybody, you are not gonna believe this one...
... but I am standing in the middle of a burger rain.
you may have seen a meteor shower...
... but you've never seen a shower meatier than this.
for a town stuck eating sardines, this is totally manna from heaven.
this tastes significantly better than sardines.
this is going to be big.
this food weather was created intentionally...
... by meek-ish backyard tinkerer Flint Lockwood.
flint Lockwood?
you're under arrest for ruining Sardine Land.
flint, those burgers were awesome.
the producer called and he was like, "Everybody loves that food weather."
food weather. - What?
this could be bigger than Sardine Land.
can you make it rain food again? - No.
I don't know if l... - You're gonna do it again?
you gotta be kidding.
please, please, please.
Yes. - No.
give me one more chance. - We know this was an accident.
I know. - Cheeseburgers from the sky...
...that's not natural.
my invention could save the whole town.
you will be so proud of me, Dad.
plus...
...there's a girl here.
can you look me in the eye and tell me you've got this under control...
...and it's not gonna end up in a disaster?
Yes.
I've got this under control, and it's not gonna end in disaster.
all right. - Thanks, Dad.
Oh, sure. - Okay. So, Sam...
...this is where the magic happens.
lick. Lick. Lick.
lick. Lick. Lick.
welcome, Flint.
you seriously spend a lot of time alone.
what?
so here's how it works.
water goes in the top, and food comes out the bottom.
when you shot it into the stratosphere...
...you figured it would induce a phase change from the cumulonimbus layer?
that's actually a really smart observation.
I mean...
the clouds probably have water in them...
...which, I guess, is why you shot it up there in the first place.
right, right. That's why I did that.
on purpose. - Right. Yeah.
right. - Of course.
okay.
the machine uses a principle of hydro-genetic mutation.
water molecules are bombarded with microwave radiation...
...which mutates their genetic recipe into any kind of food you want.
so...
pizza? - Yes.
mashed potatoes? - Yes.
peas? - Yes, that's also a food.
steak? Apples? - Yes.
apple sauce? BLT? - Yes.
I said any kind of food. - Chicken wings?
think about what you're saying, and if it's a food, yes.
baloney. - Baloney. That is a food.
how about Jell-O? - Do you like Jell-O?
I love Jell-O.
I love Jell-O too. Oh, and peanut butter, right?
Oh, no, no, no, I am severely allergic to peanuts.
Hey, me too.
what's it called? - Peanut allergy.
no, the machine. - Of course.
it's called the Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super-Mutating...
...Dynamic Food Replicator.
or, for short:
Manny, make sure you get this. He's gonna make the food now.
now?
well, the thing is, I can't...
... wait to show you this hilarious Internet video.
what?
what is this?
it's so cute.
pushing. Folding. Connecting.
taping. Turning. Painting. Switching.
staring.
motivating.
placing button. - I can't believe I've been watching this...
...for three hours. - I know.
it's working.
what do you guys want for breakfast?
gummi Bears. - Whoa, Steve, no.
we both know how you get around Gummi Bears.
how about...
...eggs. - And toast.
orange juice.
and bacon. - Bacon.
what are you doing?
nothing.
to the computer.
so you're sure this is safe?
don't worry. I have a Dangeometer that lets us know...
...if the food is going to over-mutate.
what happens if the food over-mutates?
I don't know. But that'll never happen.
all right, this probably won't explode.
what?
bacon.
those cheeseburgers were only the beginning...
...because a breakfast system is on its way to Swallow Falls.
my forecast?
sunny side up.
flint, my boy. Can you do lunch?
all right, here's the skinny:
you keep making it rain the snackadoos...
...weathergirl provides free advertising...
...I have taken out a very high-interest loan...
...to convert this Podunk town into a tourist food-topia.
all you have to do is make it rain food three meals a day...
...every day for the foreseeable future...
...and in 30 days we hold a grand reopening of the island...
...as a must-see cruise destination.
and everyone, everywhere...
...is going to love your invention.
do you think so?
I know so.
now that's what I call poultry in motion.
chew and swallow anti-gas tablet international house of cumin
Mr. Lockwood, may I please have waffles?
Falafels? - Jellybeans.
avocado. - Coming right up.
leftovers?
not a problem with Flint Lockwood's latest invention, the Outtasighter...
...so-named because it catapults uneaten food out of sight...
...and therefore, out of mind.
flint lockwood napkins mouth funnels
jellybeans!
awesome.
BLT. - Doughnuts.
pie.
gummi bears.
fish. - Crème brǔlée!
a pizza stuffed inside a turkey...
...the whole thing deep-fried and dipped in chocolate.
it's me, the mayor.
you look different.
did you get a new haircut?
Yes, I did. Thank you for noticing.
I love you. - Thanks, Dad. I love you.
I love spending time with you, Dad.
sardines 100% off
Hey, Dad, I'm headed back to the lab.
if you wanna come, I could show you how I make the food.
no, thanks.
that techno-food, it's too complicated for an old fisherman.
got it.
could still use your help around here, though, you know.
I'm working with the mayor now, Dad.
I mean, the town's grand reopening is in, like, a week.
right. Got it.
flint Lockwood?
yeah?
it's my son Cal's birthday tomorrow...
...and I was just wondering if you could make it rain something special.
well, I'm pretty backed up on requests.
Plus, you're always mean to me.
it'll be just one time...
...for my special angel's special day.
I don't know.
you know, I don't wanna overwork the machine, so...
okay. I knew it was a long shot.
I just wanted Cal to see how much his father loves him.
I thought you would understand.
you know how fathers always trying to express...
...their love and appreciation for their sons.
Earl, wait.
touch. Touch. Touch.
I've got an idea.
happy birthday, son.
dad?
this is your day. Go have fun.
I love you guys. You're awesome. - I love you too, son.
have a good time, baby. - Ice cream!
Yeah! Cool.
strawberry's my favorite.
come on, Dad.
I don't know, Cal.
this doesn't look safe!
I love you, son.
I know, Dad. You tell me every day.
flint, this is amazing.
and designing the ice cream to accumulate into scoops...
...I don't know how you're gonna top this.
maybe with hot fudge.
Hey, Flint.
you wanna be in a snowball fight with us?
flint, what's the problem?
I've never actually been in a snowball fight.
Really? - I don't even know the rules.
is there like a point system or is it...
...to the death? - No...
you've nev...? I mean, look, even Steve is throwing chocolate snowballs.
so like this?
no, harder than that.
snowball. Snowball, snowball, snowball.
snowball. Snowball.
well, something to be said for enthusiasm.
Snowball!
Snowball!
snowball and snowball.
kids? What's going on?
snowball.
snowball. - Snowball. Snowball.
I scream, you scream...
... we all scream for Flint Lockwood's latest tasty town-wide treat...
... with flurries of frozen fun on what the mayor declared to be...
... an ice cream snow day.
he'd also like to invite everyone in the world to catch a cruise liner...
... and come on down this Saturday...
... for the grand opening of Chew And Swallow...
... a town that is truly à la mode.
a town that is truly topped with ice cream.
with today's scoop for the Weather News Network...
...l'm Sam Sparks.
flint, this is the best breakfast ever.
that's it!
researching. Role-playing.
dialing.
waiting.
Sam Sparks. - Hanging up.
regretting. Re-psyching.
saying what I'm doing.
flint? - "Hi, Sam, how are you? That's nice."
I was wondering if you would like to go on a da...
activity with me tomorrow.
okay. - Great, bye. Meet me in the forest.
nailed it. Gotta go, Steve.
keep an eye on the lab for me.
Steve.
foster still at the plate.
and nobody out.
where are we going?
Oh, nowhere. I just thought it'd be nice for the two of us to go on a walk together.
like you do as friends.
Oh, my, what's that?
Jell-O's my favorite.
you never made a request, so...
...I made one for you.
flint?
flint?
join me.
but how did you...?
I made it rain Jell-O, then I gathered it up with the Outtasighter...
...and then I brought it here and pressed it...
...into a gigantic custom-carved plastic Tupperware mold I made. No big deal.
everything's made of Jell-O.
this piano, those sconces...
...that ghetto blaster, that Jell-O, that aquarium...
...that Venus de Milo with your face on it...
...next to a Michelangelo's David that also has your face.
come on, Sam, what are you waiting for?
exit
nothing!
cannonball.
belly flop.
why did I do that?
so Jell-O. - Right. Right, right.
it's a solid, it's a liquid...
...It's a visco-elastic polymer made of polypeptide chains, but you eat it.
I mean...
...it tastes good.
why do you do that? - Do what?
say something super smart and then bail from it.
can you keep a secret?
no.
but this time, sure, yeah.
okay. Well, it was a really long time ago, but I, too, was...
...a nerd.
too?
when I was a little girl...
...I wore a ponytail, I had glasses...
...and I was totally obsessed with the science of weather.
other girls wanted a Barbie.
I wanted a Doppler Weather Radar 2000 Turbo.
but all the kids used to taunt me with this lame song.
it wasn't even clever.
four-eyes, four-eyes
you need glasses to see
go on.
so I got a new look...
...gave up the science-y smart stuff...
...and I was never made fun of again.
and I still need these glasses, but I never wear them.
I'll bet you look great with glasses on. - I'm not...
and on they go.
what? - Nothing.
wait.
it's a Jell-O scrunchie.
and now, the reveal.
I mean, you were okay before...
...but now...
...you're beautiful.
no, I'm not. I can't go out in public like this.
well, why not?
I mean, this is the real you, right?
smart.
Bespectacled.
who wouldn't wanna see that?
you know, I've never met anyone like you, Flint Lockwood.
me either.
but about you.
flint, you have a call
flint, you have a call
is your phone ringing?
that's weird. Someone must've changed my ring.
Oh, it's the mayor. Do you mind if I take this?
no, no, no.
go ahead, take it. That's fine. - I'm sorry. It's important.
I should be going too. It's getting late. - I'm just gonna step outside.
dad, you came. I have so much to tell you.
do I look all right? - You look great. Come on, let's go.
dad, I almost kissed a girl.
it's Baby Brent, you know? - It was the coolest thing... Hi.
I should be on the list. - Hey, Brian.
what? You're letting that guy in? That guy's a nerd.
Hey, how's it going?
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.
a toast. To Flint and his delicious steaks.
Oh, thanks. Thank you. - Very nice place.
Oh, wow. Thank you.
flint Lockwood. - Earl.
so no roof.
Yep. You just hold out your plate.
and I even made it rain your favorite:
meat.
okay.
so you know how the grand reopening of the town is tomorrow?
well, the mayor has asked me to cut the ribbon.
he said my invention saved the town.
aren't you proud of me?
well...
...doesn't this steak look a little big to you?
Yeah, it's a big steak. I mean, every steak is not exactly the same size.
did you even hear what I just said?
son, look around.
I'm not sure this is good for people.
maybe you should think about turning this thing off.
it's making everybody happy.
everybody except you.
when are you gonna accept that this is who I am...
...instead of trying to get me to work in some boring tackle shop?
well...
...you seem like you know what you're doing, then.
I guess I'll just get out of your way.
get with the times, man.
I mean, there's no pleasing that guy.
he just wants to take anything good I do and just smoosh it.
these are big hot dogs.
man.
I mean, this isn't that bad.
is it, Steve? - Yellow.
you're right, Steve.
the Dangeometer is in the yellow.
I don't know what to do.
I do...
...declare these hot dogs to be delicious!
Oh, no.
how did you get in here?
tomorrow's the big day, Flint.
the entire town's fate is resting on your food weather.
I'm thinking pasta.
some light apps. I know you won't let us down.
well, Mr. Mayor, I think there's something you should see.
what?
this is the molecular structure of a hot dog that fell last week.
and this is the molecular structure of a hot dog that fell today.
the machine uses microwave radiation...
...to mutate the genetic recipe of the food.
the more we ask it to make, the more clouds it takes in...
...the more radiation it emits, the more these molecules could over-mutate.
I think that's why the food is getting bigger.
here's what I heard:
science, science, science, bigger.
and bigger is better.
everyone's gonna love these new portion sizes.
I know I do.
my dad thinks I should turn it off.
geniuses like us are never understood by their fathers, Flint.
but what if things go...
who needs the approval of one family member...
...when you can have it from millions of acquaintances?
not to mention that little cutlet, Sam Sparks.
and me.
I've always felt that you were like a son to me, Flint.
and I'm gonna be so proud of you tomorrow when you cut that ribbon...
...save the town...
...and prove to everybody what a great inventor you are.
so here's the cheese:
you can keep it going...
...get everything you've ever wanted...
...and be the great man I know you can be.
or you can turn it off...
...ruin everything...
...and no one will ever like you.
it's your choice.
choice.
choice.
choice.
choice.
choice.
okay.
I mean, bigger is better...
...right?
Oh, yeah.
spaghetti. Asparagus. Celery. Garlic bread. Meatball. Shrimp.
looks safe to me. - And sanitary too.
doppler 2000 turbo
who's hungry?
welcome, tourists, to Chew And Swallow.
that is one big mayor.
delight in our nacho-cheese hot springs.
allow your kids to eat all the junk food they want...
...in our completely unsupervised Kid Zone!
I've got jellybeans for teeth.
and when the fun is done...
...gaze upon the sunset cresting over Mount Leftovers.
from which we're protected by a presumably indestructible dam.
we've got people here today from all around the world...
...from as far as China to West Virginia.
also I think there's some Canadians here.
you need to look at this. - Why aren't you on TV?
you're supposed to be broadcasting this.
there's a problem. The food's getting bigger.
I know, it's great. Bigger portion sizes. Everyone loves it.
I'm not sure we're doing the right thing here.
what if we've bitten off more than we can chew?
for the first time in my life, everybody loves something that I've done.
why can't you just be happy for me...
...and go say the weather or something. Jeez.
and without further ado...
...our town's hero and my metaphorical son...
...Flint Lockwood.
Yeah, Flint.
thank you. Thank you, everyone.
sign my shrimp. - Thank you.
Yeah. Yeah. - I love you.
I admire your quirkiness, dude.
Brent, we're gonna need you to hand over the ceremonial scissors.
but...
no.
you can't. You can't take them. No. - Here you go.
I'm Baby Brent.
put your clothes back on.
who am I?
go ahead, Flint.
everybody loves you.
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!
Lockwood! Lockwood! Lockwood!
danger. Danger. Danger.
salt-and-pepper wind?
oregano.
Sam, wait. No, I can turn it off.
I can turn it off.
all right, kid, it's all gonna be okay.
Oh, no.
pardon me. - Pardon me.
excuse me. - No problem.
no.
gummi Bears. - Not now, Steve.
condiments? Salt? Pepper?
flint.
this is Sam Sparks, live from Chew And Swallow...
...where a spaghetti twister...
Sam, hey, we love a good storm over here, but you look like a nerd.
Patrick, several children are stranded in the path of this tomato tornado.
my tummy hurts.
Cal.
what is that, a scrunchie? I haven't seen one of those since 1995.
what? We have an actual weather emergency.
well, we'll get right back to that storm...
... and hopefully Sam'll look a little more appealing.
Steve, we just have to upload the kill code and then we'll shut down the...
what are you doing here?
I've been ordering dinner for the last 10 minutes.
is something going on? - I've gotta stop the machine.
everyone's in danger because of me.
Oh, it can't be that bad.
no. - Well, I'm out of here.
I can still stop the order with the kill code.
sending kill code. - I'm back.
got to get the button.
play. Fun. Fun. Play.
Hey, Flint. It's been nice to beet you.
that's a radish.
that was the only way to communicate with the machine.
what exactly did you order?
a Vegas-style all-you-can-eat buffet.
jellybean. Watermelon. Marshmallow. Pretzel. Sushi.
cheeseburger. Pretzel. Egg salad. Strawberry. Marshmallow.
strawberry.
is everyone okay? - Yeah.
help, somebody.
help me, please.
it's my son.
we need a doctor.
is anyone here a doctor? Anyone?
I am a doctor.
you are?
I was, back in Guatemala.
I came here for a better life.
pretty great decision, eh?
how is he, doc?
he's in a food coma.
too much junk food.
I need a celery, stat.
here you go.
daddy? - Oh, Cal. Cal.
I love you, son.
looks like everything turned out okay.
not yet, it hasn't.
that twister was an amuse-bouche compared to what's on the way.
what's an amuse-bouche? - Manny, patch us through.
go.
cute report, Nancy. Hey. Hey. Four-eyes.
can it, Patrick.
we are about to be in the epicenter of a perfect food storm.
it's going to spread across the globe.
I've calculated the Coriolis acceleration of the storm system.
first, it'll hit New York...
... then Paris...
... then the Jiayuguan Pass in eastern China.
and in four hours the entire northern hemisphere will be one big potluck.
flint?
flint?
Hey, Dad.
what are you doing?
well, I tried to help everybody...
...but instead I ruined everything.
I'm just a piece of junk.
so I threw myself away.
along with all these dumb inventions.
this is junk.
this is junk.
this is junk.
Oh, son. Listen, when your boat is, when it's listing...
...and if it's not running, you know...
don't worry, Dad, I get it.
mom was wrong about me.
I'm not an inventor.
I should've just quit when you said.
well...
...when it rains, you put on a coat.
dad, you know I don't understand fishing metapho...
what?
my coat.
come on, Steve. We've got diem to carpe.
kill code downloading.
redesigning. Virtualizing.
cutting.
welding. Forging.
wiring. - Helping.
testing.
Yes.
flying Car 2.
now with wings.
Hey, I had a weird dream like this once.
I have a macaroni on my head.
run.
no school!
still nothing, nothing in the bottom of the third inning.
everyone.
I want to apologize.
especially to you, Sam.
but I have a plan.
this flash drive contains a kill code.
I will fly up into that food storm, plug it into the machine...
...and shut it down forever...
...while you guys evacuate the island, using brea...
this is all his fault. Get him.
there he is! Get him!
get Flint.
let's rock his car back and forth.
this mess we're in is all our faults.
me, I didn't even protect my own son.
look, I'm as mad at Flint as you are.
in fact, when he gets out of that car, I'm gonna slap him in the face.
I know Flint Lockwood made the food, but it was made-to-order.
and now it's time for all of us to pay the bill.
thank you, Earl.
sorry. - It's okay.
let's go build some boats. - Yeah.
I'm gonna go build a boat.
I'm coming with you.
you're gonna need someone to navigate you through that storm.
I can't let you do this alone.
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry. - Are you kidding?
well, I just thought that we... - No.
okay.
you are going to need a copilot. - You're a pilot too?
Yes. I am also a particle physicist.
Really? - No, that was a joke.
I am also a comedian.
let's do this thing. - I'm coming too.
Brent, that's okay.
no, it's not okay.
I've been coasting on my fame since I was a baby.
but it was all just an illusion.
maybe up there I'll find out who I really am.
the car's pretty full, so...
Brent.
okay.
good luck, son.
Steve.
pea-soup fog.
Manny, hit the wipers.
there's massive gastro-precipitation accumulated around the machine.
it's almost as if it's...
inside a giant meatball.
water goes in the top...
...a food hurricane comes out the bottom.
glad I'm wearing a diaper.
anybody order pizza?
hold on.
the pizza's chasing us?
sentient food? That's impossible.
unless its molecular structure's mutated into super food!
that's been genetically engineered to protect the FLDSMDFR.
pizza.
pizza. Pizza. Pizza.
that was close. I mean, can you imagine if we lost this kill code?
Tim's Tackle Shop. - Dad.
you're okay, great.
I need a favor. The fate of the world depends on it!
okay, then, skipper. What do you need?
go into my lab, get on my computer and e-mail a file to my cell phone.
all right.
want me to drive? - Yeah, okay.
you're a lot better than me.
okay, here's the plan:
Sam and I will enter the meateroid through the intake here...
...which should lead us straight to the FLDSMDFR.
Manny, you and Steve stay on the plane. Don't spray that.
once my dad e-mails me the kill code, we'll destroy the machine...
...and rendezvous at the western blowhole in...
how long until the world's destroyed? - Twenty minutes.
just before then.
what about me, Brent? What do I do?
you can be president of the back seat.
deploy hatch.
car upside down, go.
ladies first?
no?
all right.
wait for me.
great. Okay, I'm good.
as long as we stay on course, it should be a straight shot to the...
we're a team.
we've landed here in some kind of exhaust vent.
if we go this way, the Flamidabager should be right down this air shaft.
Brent, get out of that pie.
what's that?
Oh, boy.
welcome, Flint.
that's fry oil.
flint, you have a call.
flint, you have a...
dad. Oh, okay, great.
on the screen there's a file marked "kill code."
Wha...? - Move that into my e-mail window...
...type in my name, and press send.
window? - Okay, Dad...
...you see the thing that looks like a little piece of paper?
use the mouse to drag it.
drag it? Drag it. - Drag it. Drag it.
right? Okay. Great. Okay, great.
it's not dragging.
drag it across the desktop.
that didn't do anything. - Of course it didn't! You know what?
go, go, go.
hoist those sails. Toast that bread.
we are running out of time.
let's move out. Go, go, go.
we can do it. Come on, move it, move it.
good job. That's what I'm talking about. Everybody head to the docks.
wait, wait.
I have an important announcement.
see you, suckers.
bon voyage.
and bon appétit.
Cal. - Calvin.
Cal, get back here.
Foodalanche. - Cal.
I'm not gonna lose you again.
baby.
hold on tight, Calvin.
everybody head south. We gotta stay ahead of that storm.
now what? - Just click "send.
flint, the Fliminadifiserser's right down there!
dad, hurry. - Send. Send.
Oh, wait.
dad? Dad? Can you hear me?
dad?
Hey, guys?
holy crap balls.
go, go, go.
I don't know. I think they're kind of cute.
I mean, this one just walked right up to me and...
he's got me!
they ate Brent. - They ate Brent.
dad, I'm surrounded by man-eating chickens right now.
so if this is goodbye...
... thanks for trying to set me straight.
figured it out a little late, I guess.
okay, bye.
dad.
Hey, give me that phone back.
baby Brent?
I'm not Baby Brent anymore.
I'm Chicken Brent.
and I'm finally contributing to society.
crotch kick.
now go, you crazy kids, and save the world.
you did it, Chicken Brent. You really did it.
go, go, go.
it should be right down this hole.
that's peanut brittle.
if either one of us touches it, we'll go into anaphylactic shock.
actually, I'm not entirely allergic to peanuts.
I might have just said that to get you to like me.
so you really thought having allergies would make you more attractive?
mustache.
Mus...
sesame bagel. - Hey, taxi.
taxi. - Taxi.
I asked for extra mustard.
the end of the world is today! the end is tomorrow
I was right.
hot tea?
did he say hot tea?
you are about to be crushed by a giant corn.
run.
it looks like the food storm is following an unusual pattern...
... of hitting the world's famous landmarks first...
... and is now spreading to the rest of the globe.
what the what?
hurry up, guys.
after I plug my phone into the FLDSMDFR and destroy it...
...l'll tug on the licorice twice and you'll pull me back up, okay?
sounds great.
Oh, no.
you got cut, didn't you?
it's just a scratch.
Brent, you need to take Sam back to the plane to get her an allergy shot.
just a second.
what? No.
let go, Sam. - I'm not gonna let you go.
flint, you'll be stuck down there.
it's not ideal, no.
come with us. We'll start over.
we'll live underground. Use bacon for clothes.
Sam, that's not a very good plan.
it is if it means I don't have to lose you.
look, I like you, okay?
like... Like, as a friend?
no.
like, "like you" like you.
me too.
but about you.
goodbye, Sam.
flint. No.
hang on, Sam.
Dr. Manny's got the medicine for your face.
pickles.
beets.
banana.
strawberry.
Manny, we're on our way. Hurry. - Hang on, Sam.
I'm circling the blowhole.
scared.
gummi Bears.
play with us, play with us. Eat us, eat us.
hungry.
hungry. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears. Gummi Bears. Steve hungry. Hungry.
steve starving. Hungry. Hungry. Starving.
Manny. Where are you?
she touched a peanut or something. - Oh, boy.
corn.
grabbing.
tying. Throwing.
waiting.
swinging.
sorry, old friend. The kitchen's closed.
dad.
no.
when it rains, you put on a coat...
...of Spray-On Shoes.
just... There were chickens...
Where's Flint?
No!
I know, kid.
I know.
cool. - Yeah. All right.
flint?
I'm sorry.
your son was a great man.
Steve. - Steve.
flint. - Brent.
flint. - Cal.
Steve. - Flint.
Earl. - Flint.
you guy. - Steve.
Sam.
flint.
Sam.
flint. - Flint.
dad. - Steve.
flint.
look, when you... When you cast your line...
...if it's not straight...
Oh, for crying out loud.
I'm proud of you, Flint.
I'm amazed that someone as ordinary as me...
... could be the father of someone as extraordinary as you.
you're talented, you're a total original.
and your lab is breathtaking.
your mom, she always knew you were going to be special.
and if she were alive today, she'd tell us both:
I told you so.
now, look, when I take this thing off...
... and you hear me make a fishing metaphor...
... just know that fishing metaphor means:
I love my son.
I love you too, Dad.
so where were we?
you were about to kiss me.
were you gonna kiss me back?
why don't you find out?
because I don't want to go for it and then get shut down again.
just kiss me. - You know...
Yeah. I'm a chicken.
this was not well thought out.
you okay?
I think it overheated
that much steam, it's probably a good bet
I started to call Triple-A, and then my battery died
I don't suppose I could use yours
sorry. I left it at home
but if you want a ride to town, I'd be happy to drop you at the gas station
no, thanks
you mind if I...?
what?
sorry. It's just, I'm an artist
there's this project I'm working on you'd be perfect for
is that your dog?
that's Buster
shepherd, right?
I thought you said you left your cell phone at home
hmm. Could have sworn I did
may I use it?
please?
just about a few more miles to the gas station
still, I'd like to call my boyfriend
tell him where I am
tell him where to meet me
please?
not a problem
Oh!
you ever think about those Ancient Greek statues?
how hard it must have been back then?
first, you had to find the perfect piece of stone excavate it from wherever it is you found it haul it back to your studio, I can't even imagine how
and all that is before the artist could begin his work
my process is a lot like that
the hardest part?
finding the perfect canvas
that... would be you
Ugh!
you coming to bed soon?
just nodded off doing my homework
I don't know how you do it
I don't know how you look at that grisly stuff every night
it's been a month now. This guy's out there hacking up girls
you're staring at pictures of his victims, hoping to dream about him
me? I would have given up by now
Yeah. It's my job
and by the way, it just happened
what do you mean? What just happened?
you finally had one?
after all this time, you finally had a dream about this guy?
it was nothing big
I mean, I saw the victim
the rest of it didn't make a lot of sense but at least I saw the victim
I guess that's a start
that's it?
you finally have a big breakthrough and all you can say is, "I guess that's a start"?
I would think you'd be more excited
Yeah, I know
Patricia Gilmartin, age 24
works as a hostess at a restaurant downtown
we're positive this is the work of our guy?
the same brand of filter-less he left at the other three crime scenes
found them outside in the alley
five cigarettes
he must have been waiting out there for over an hour
he's a patient pervert
I get the feeling the anticipation's a big part of it for this guy
the way he hangs onto them
keeping 'em alive...
cutting them, cutting them, cutting them...
...until finally, they can't bear it any longer, and they just expire
I don't want to find this one in a Dumpster, Lee. I don't want to find this one in a landfill
if he took her last night, then she's still alive. If he took her last night, then he's still enjoying her
hang on. We need to find her -Knock, knock. Sorry I'm late -Go
my youngest-- she was having issues with potty training
it's okay. You didn't miss anything except your boss's foul mood
the boys have already been through the bedroom. There's nobody in there if you want to go in, see if you get anything or whatever
sure
Oh, remind me to tell you about a very interesting program I saw last night
it was the first killing, Kathy Summers. The girl he picked up on the interstate last month
And?
and it turns out, he has a dog
buster. His name is Buster
I'm sorry. I guess I'm missing the point
well, I guess I figured if we could find him...
are you suggesting that we try and track down his dog?
well, it's the only clue I got
he has a German Shepherd
it's likely he has a license, and if he does his owner's address is on it which means our killer's address is on it
okay. We'll definitely get somebody on that, but I'm confused. If you...
had a dream about the killer -if you saw the killer... -But I didn't
it wasn't that kind of dream. It was more like, I felt what he felt. It wasn't so much about seeing it was... it was more about feeling
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I... I'm still not following you
I don't know... the hacking...
the hack marks in their skin
he considers that art
he considers himself an artist
he thinks what he does to them is beautiful
and how do you know that?
because I was in his head; I was him
and that's what I felt when I looked at her
but it's my turn
there are no turns. It's not about turns-- it's mine and you're not getting it
but you've had the top bunk forever
that's because it's mine. Just like the bottom bunk is yours -Forever. -Mom!
bridge, Ariel got here first and if she doesn't want to switch, I'm not gonna make her switch
but that's not fair!
it's totally fair. It's mine
and you're not getting it
not until I go to college anyways
Oh, and when's that gonna be? In, like, a trillion years?!
two trillion
sit down, babe. Hello?
care to hazard a guess as to how many Shepherds named Buster have been registered in Phoenix over the past 15 years?
uh, ten?
try 34
I myself have visited 12 of them this afternoon and have yet to come across a single owner with a mutilated girl on the premises
sorry I couldn't give you something more specific
uh, it's okay. We all knew it was sort of a Hail Mary
that said, if you have any new dreams anything that might narrow down the search a little...
I know where to find you
looking at Busters. Wish me luck
luck
here's what I got
guy's got a Shepherd named Buster who's barking his head off, a pack of filterless smokes sitting on the front seat of his car with what looks to me like blood on the wrapper
nobody's answering the door
am I waiting for a warrant or am I convinced, based on the blood I see in the car that the owner of the house is bleeding to death and may need police assistance?
if you have a reasonable fear that a homeowner may be in dire need of police assistance, than you have no choice
detective Scanlon
be sure and call for backup
Hello?
three guesses where I'm calling from
uh... it sounds like a party
well, I guess you could call it that
I'm at Buster's house
you're kidding
Nope
we found the Gilmartin girl-- alive, by the way
turns out old Buster shares this place with a sick twist by the name of Albert Marcotto
is he there? Did you catch him?
caught isn't exactly the right word
the M. E. is giving him the once-over as we speak
she thinks he had a coronary sometime last night
he's dead?
the girl said he went into the bathroom at 11: 45
she heard a crash, he never came out
you still there?
Yeah, I'm here 11: 45, you're sure about that?
there's a clock over the door
she could see it from where he was keeping her
Why?
it's nothing, it's just...
that's around the time that I had the dream
well, you can sleep easy tonight
so can the rest of Phoenix
Albert Marcotto is a threat no more
can I get you anything else?
one more whiskey
I know it's rude to count but that'll be your fifth
you're right, it's rude
rough day?
no, it was a good one, actually
I found someone I was looking for
friend or family?
neither
and yet it's cause for celebration?
absolutely
so are you going to tell me who you found or do I have to guess?
if you don't mind me saying you have the loveliest skin
five shots of whiskey and I start looking good to a lot of folks
no, I mean it
you're going to be beautiful when you're 80
you know that?
that one's on me
okay, are you sure I can't call you a cab?
just get me to my car, I'll be fine
I swear to God
okay. This you?
yeah
let's get you there
okay
okay, that tears it
anyone who can't even open their car door is officially too drunk to be driving
so, all right
I'm just going to take these keys and we're going to find you another way to get home, okay?
I know I shouldn't take it personally when you leave our bed in the middle of the night
I'm sorry
I just had to look at this
of course you did...
it's 3: 00 in the morning
I had a dream about the second killing
well, the second snatching, really
three days after she disappeared a homeless man found her body in a Dumpster
her face was cut up so badly they had to use her dental records to identify her
wait a second, I'm confused
didn't you say before we went to bed that they caught the guy who did this?
that he was dead?
so what are you dreaming about?
it's weird
it's the killings
well, two of the three, anyway
except, when I see them...
I am him
I see what he sees
I feel what he feels.
but now he's gone...
...and it's all over
Joe, I don't know why I'm being shown these things
I can't figure out why I'm being made to feel these things
you know what you need?
sleep
Dr. Joe says it's time to put these gruesome pictures to bed and get some sleep
really, Dr. Joe? That's the answer?
I don't know if you've noticed, honey but you've managed to amass here quite a collection of gruesome ginsu flesh pictures
you'll see, you'll like it
you lay down, close your eyes
you do nothing
mark my words
it's going to be all the rage
you excited?
no, scared
you will teach me?
don't worry, I'm the master
who wants salsa with their eggs?
me! Me! Me!
do my senses deceive me or is my wife actually cooking breakfast?
what, you expect these girls to live on cereal alone?
Yeah, do you?
you get back to sleep last night?
or did you feel compelled to dive back into your box of horrors?
the truth?
I laid there for about an hour then I watched TV till it was time to wake the girls
well, I suppose that's a start
thank you for your encouragement, Dr. Joe
Oh, I was hoping to get my hair done today but the only time Elaine can get me is 3: 00
is there any way you could pick up the girls?
what?
starting a little early, aren't we?
and since when do you drink whiskey?
I don't
I thought I was pouring myself some orange juice "Geronimo frozen pizza."
Damn!
can I help you find something?
ma'am, are you okay?
I'm fine; I was just looking for Geronimo pizza
sure
we have plenty of those right over here
thanks
you've been sitting out here for a while
I thought you were maybe waiting to look at the open apartment
I'm the manager
I can show it to you if you want
no, I'm not here to see an apartment
you lost or something?
you need directions?
I just...
I lost track of time
I sorry, no...
I have to go now
I'm home!
I could use some help with the groceries!
Hey!
car's full of groceries...
it's 20 past 7: 00
well, it's getting dark so early
I guess I lost track of...
mommy, the bottom of the bag's all wet
must have sat in the car longer than I realized
you know, I've been calling your cell phone for almost four hours
I don't know why I wouldn't have heard it
I must have shut it off without realizing
Ariel, can you get the rest of the bags out of the car put some stuff away
Bridgette, watch Marie for a minute
mommy and I need to have a talk in the bedroom
all right, first, tell me you're okay
I'm okay
you know, we've had these conversations before -about consideration, about calling -I know
I can't find you, I don't hear from you
I call the hair salon-- Elaine said that you never even showed up for your appointment
no, I know
no, I don't think you do know
for all your empathy, for all your sensitivity
I don't think you know what it's like to sit here with the girls from 3: 00 on and not be able to answer the question "Where's Mommy?"
no, I do, and I am sorry
have you been smoking?
Allison, what the hell is going on?
I don't know
I-I went to the supermarket
I saw this girl
What?! She was perfect
just the sort of girl that Marcotto would go for
what does this have to do with Marcotto?
these girls, to him, they're like canvases
these blank spaces just waiting to be turned into these beautiful works of art
he, he likes their fresh skin the way that they're kind of innocent-looking not a lot of makeup
I noticed that her name was Mindy that she worked there
when I looked at her, when I was close to her
I felt like I had found exactly what I was looking for
and I couldn't let her get away
sorry, Allison, why do you keep saying "I"?
you weren't looking for anybody
but it's like I was
so... I hung around
I waited for her to shift to end and I followed her
I followed her home
I sat there, my car full of groceries and I lit up Marcotto's favorite brand of cigarettes, and I... I watched her
I watched her for hours
you stalked her?
you didn't hurt her, you didn't touch her you didn't confront her in any way, right?
Allison, I'm baffled. Why?
I mean, why would you do something like that?
I'm not sure
these dreams that I've been having lately
I just assumed they were coming from some victim
someone who wanted me to catch him put an end to what he was doing
but now... I'm pretty sure they're coming from him
I think he's trying to tell me something
I-I just don't know what it is
maybe he's not trying to tell you anything
maybe he's trying to get you to do something
No!
uh-uh, that's not what it felt like
I suddenly became very interested in that girl and it was overwhelming, and it was creepy but I was me the whole time
I knew it was wrong
I knew I was late. I knew I should call
I'm not channeling this guy and I'm sure as hell not gonna start killing for him
Yeah, but you started smoking for him
no, I smoked in college
it's in my history. It's something that I would do
cutting people up, killing people-- no
well, I'm glad you're so certain
I'll have Ariel call, see if she can stay over at Hannah's
maybe Alan and Kendall can take Bridgette and Marie
we can drive them there, then I'll pick them up, take them to school in the morning -What? Why? -Why?
did you hear yourself?
you just confessed to me you spent the last several hours driving around the city looking for innocent flesh to carve up
there's no way in hell I'm letting our girls stay in this house while you've got this guy in your head
but, Joe
but nothing
I love you, but, frankly, you're scaring the crap out of me
I'm sorry
just let me make some calls, get them started packing
I'll send them in there to say good-bye
meantime, maybe you can wash that smell off
kids are all fine
I know you have no control over what's going on
I don't blame you
I want to discuss something important with you
I want to discuss your legacy
the first line of your obituary
the summation of your life
that's really what we're doing here
we're giving your life some kind of lasting meaning
I can tell from your expression you're skeptical
but you shouldn't be
it's been several hundred years, but everyone still remembers
the Girl with the Pearl Earrings, ...Lisa from the Mona Lisa.
great art is like that; it lives forever
and its subjects... live forever
this will only hurt for a minute
you've got to stop this
I had another dream
I skipped over the third victim
What?!
for God's sake, Allison, it's the middle of the night!
the killer is dead, the crime spree is over
don't you see? He skipped over the third victim
the third victim, Julie Paxon
he skipped right over her
and had showed me the fourth girl, Patricia Gilmartin the one we saved
I think I know why he showed me that girl in the supermarket
he wants me to understand what he likes what he looks for when he chooses them so that when I saw a counterfeit, I would know
a what?" A counterfeit?"I don't understand
her complexion's too dark. She wears too much makeup-- she looks cheap
he would never choose her, never in a million years
that's why I skipped over her
that's why I didn't dream about her murder
Marcotto couldn't send it to me,'cause he didn't do it
that's the message, Joe
that's what he's been trying to tell me
he didn't kill this woman
someone else did
he's offended?
I believe so, yes
Albert Marcotto took his "art" very seriously
when we attributed Julie Paxon's murder to him
I think he took offense
I think he finds it insulting which is why he's been sending me these dreams so we could help restore his "reputation.
well, you'll forgive me if I don't lose a lot of sleep worrying about the feelings of a dead sociopath
that's not the point
then what is?
Allison, the inclusion of Julie Paxon in Albert Marcotto's body count was hardly done arbitrarily
he was blamed for her death because she was murdered in precisely the same horrific manner as his other two victims
nevertheless, I think we made a mistake
you saw the bodies
you saw how they were violated
it takes a unique capacity for cruelty to do that to another human being. Wouldn't you agree?
unique, yes
impossible to duplicate, no
what are you saying? You think we got some sort of copycat killer on the loose?
well, maybe, or maybe it was someone who only intended to commit one murder: Julie Paxon's someone who carved her up to look like Marcotto's handiwork so we wouldn't even consider another suspect
someone's mimicking our serial killer so precisely they even include the little details that we deliberately withheld from the press?
the geometric wound patterns?
the red twine in the ligature marks?
cops talk to their spouses
spouses talk to their friends
the wrong person could've gotten these details any number of ways
all I know is I've been in this guy's head for a few days, or he's been in mine
I've come to know his preferences
I know his taste
Julie Paxon isn't it
she's not his type
she's too done
it would be like painting on a used canvas
Allison, look at this from my side
the case is closed, the crime spree is over
what possible incentive...
for argument's sake...
on the off-chance there might actually be another killer out there what would it take to get you to open a new investigation into Julie Paxon's murder?
short of having another body show up?
bring me something more than a bad dream
bring me proof-- then maybe I'll consider it
so, in your professional opinion there was nothing different about Julie Paxon nothing that made her stand out from the first two victims?
she was young, female, pretty
I guess what I'm asking is was there anything forensically different about her?
maybe she was cut by something other than a scalpel or maybe there's some way to tell if the cuts were made by a left-handed person instead of a right-handed one
all of the incisions on all three women were identical
they were done with a cutting instrument that featured a blade no longer than six centimeters
I'm guessing some kind of scalpel
and as far as I can tell they were all made by a right-handed cutter
so you're certain this was all the work of the same man.
Why? Was there ever any question?
we're just trying to be thorough
well... then today's your lucky day
this just came in from the DNA lab
it confirms that a piece of skin we found under one of Ms. Paxon's fingernails belonged to Albert Marcotto
she scratched him
apparently
Hello, I'm home
hey
hey
they're not here?
they're not back?
they were, but...
but what?
I want my kids back!
now!
no
not just yet
what is this?
it's yours
or at least you wrote it
I found it with all the other evidence in this box
I thought maybe I could help. I figured I'd take a look in here see if I could get a better handle on what it is that you're going through
but then I saw that and I figured out I was in way over my head
and frankly, so are you
I don't understand
what is this?
I don't know. You tell me
that's the pad you were writing in last night
I didn't write this.
I was writing notes, theories about this case
well, it goes on for nine pages, Al, all in your handwriting
no notes, no theories, just "It was me"
over and over and over again
doesn't... make any sense
I don't remember
that's all the more reason to keep the girls away for one more night
it's just one more night
I'm sorry
I know it's hard
I know you don't choose to have this guy in your head
he's a bastard
he's scaring you, he's scaring me
I feel like an ass
I spent the whole day defending him
now even he said he did it
the medical examiner found his DNA under her fingernails-- Julie Paxon's
you've given this animal enough of your nights
it's time you took one for yourself
ladies and gentlemen, place your bets 500 on the pass 25 on the yellow, three, four hopping
same shooter
lucky shooter
seven winner!
well, looks like it's my walking-away time
feel like you're cooling off?
Nope, I'm just getting started
I'm gonna put it all on my Arizona boys to take UCLA
you better hurry up
they tip off in about 15 minutes
there you go...
$10, 000 right there
and 25
think I'll keep this one for luck
you all right?
no, I'm better than all right
I'm great
I had a dream... starring me, and I didn't kill anybody
Mm... Hallelujah
I won a bunch of money playing craps
I bet $500 on the pass line and it paid off
wait a second
you laid $500 on the pass line?
Mm-hmm
since when do you know how to play craps?
since last night, I guess
it was fun
we should go to Las Vegas
what?
you told me to dream about anything other than Marcotto
it's not my fault my brain picked Sin City
al, in the 13 years we've been married the only time I've ever seen you roll dice is when we're playing Chutes and Ladders with the girls
and now, suddenly, you're an expert?
which sort of begs the question
was it your vacation you dreamt about
or it's someone else's?
remind me again what we're doing here
it's a crazy long shot but I think Marcotto wants me to help him establish an alibi
I had another dream last night
took me a while to figure it out, but I think I was playing his part again
I was in Las Vegas, and I was putting a bet down on a basketball game between UCLA and Arizona
hope you bet on the Bruins
that game was a blowout
come to Mama
I checked the dates
the only time those two teams played was November 24
which is the day that Julie Paxon was kidnapped and murdered
so if my hunch is correct
Marcotto was in Las Vegas the night that she was killed
jackpot
uh... bad time?
good time
thank you
okay, well, long story short
we have reason to believe that Albert Marcotto was in a casino in Las Vegas the night that Julie Paxon was murdered
so the District Attorney's office was wondering about the possibility of you retesting the DNA that you found under her fingernails
I'm sorry, to what end?
well, clearly, Marcotto couldn't have been in two places at once
so if we can verify that he was in Nevada the night that Julie Paxon was killed, then we have to assume that the DNA results were a function of some kind of...
error
error?
I don't know. Maybe someone accidentally mislabeled the samples
or maybe it was contaminated by a sample from one of the other victims
no
that's simply not possible
I'm the only one who had access to Ms. Paxon's remains
and I can assure you, they were handled with the utmost regard for limiting the possibility of molecular degradation or cellular contamination
but if the District Attorney wants us to run them again
I'll run them again
the M. E.'s giving him the once-over as we speak
she thinks he had a coronary sometime last night
M. E. is another way of saying medical examiner, right?
right you are
the thing is, we don't want to retest the old DNA
we want to get a new sample from under Julie's fingernails
okay
and we're gonna request that someone else do it
are you married?
yes
Yes, I am
me, too 19 years, if you can believe it
has your husband ever been unfaithful?
no
they say the death of a loved one...
is the most painful loss any of us will ever know
but they would be wrong
knowing they're gone because they chose to be gone knowing they're alive and well and much happier with someone else...
...that's what hurts the most
he was gonna leave me for...
Julie Paxon
after 19 years
I went to see her at her house...
to ask her to respect what my husband and I had together to remind her... that we were a family
she thought that was a very funny...
a very old-fashioned idea
you'd be surprised how hard it was cutting her that way...
...even for someone in my line of work
so what do we do now?
she didn't even ask for an attorney
just walked right into his office and said she wanted to confess everything
guess she figured it was just a matter of time before we could prove that she tampered with the DNA evidence
no, I don't think that's it
I think it was killing her not just knowing that she'd done it, but knowing that she'd gotten away with it
I think she feels relieved
do you think Marcotto comprehends that he might have done a good thing that he helped us catch a killer?
I don't think Marcotto cares, not about that
this was about him, his ego, some sick sort of pride
well, tell him thanks, just the same
you can tell him yourself, 'cause I'm done giving out visitor passes to my head
I really just want to go home and spend some time with my family, spend some time with me
this is nice
this is good
Yeah, Mommy, this is good
I'm glad we're all together
Yeah, Mommy, we don't like it when we're not all together
mom? Mom?!
does this young fellow look familiar?
he ought to.
the sad truth is there are boys like him all across our nation.
they're the ones who just can't seem to fit in.
there could be a boy just like him living in your town.
right on your block, even going to your school.
you might not even be aware of it.
would you know what to look for?
would you know how to spot "the outsider"?
the outsider may have stopped applying himself in class.
he's probably given up trying to make friends.
rightly or wrongly, the outsider has come to feel that everyone is against him.
on the surface, he looks much like any other boy on the block.
but inside, the outsider is eaten away with resentment and a desperate urge to get even.
if enough of these feelings accumulate, he may be tempted to act out.
acting out can take many forms
antisocial behavior, rejection of one's peers...
...even, in extreme cases...
mommy.
. mouthing off to authority figures.
mommy.
what's going on?
did you have a bad dream?
mommy...
Oh, my goodness.
this is a bad dream.
I'm just saying that, you know, she got out once, she'll do it again.
we don't know that.
I think I overslept.
morning, sweetie.
morning, Mommy.
morning, Daddy.
no, but we've been to this picnic a couple times before.
you know, history would seem to suggest that once they figure out how to get over that wall, then that's that.
what are you guys talking about?
nothing.
you know what, I'll just go to the store and get some kind of safety bars or something.
I don't know, I think maybe we should just bite the bullet and buy Houdini here a big-girl bed.
I think she's ready.
how about it, sweetheart??
you want a big-girl bed?
wait a second.
why can't she just take my bed?
I could move into her room.
I'm almost 13.
I'm old enough to have my own room.
this is a conversation we should have when we have more time because everybody's got to get ready for work, for school.
but why?
it's simple.
Marie can move in with Bridgette and I can take her room.
wait a second, what about me?
what do I get?
you get the top bunk.
what do I owe the pleasure?
is this a bad time?
not for me.
those two are in some kind of hell.
it's good, they need a minute alone. What's up?
you ever heard of a high school called Claymore?
could be a private school, definitely co-ed.
not off the top of my head. Why?
I don't know, I just, I had this strange...
a hunch.
you could say that.
anyway, I forgot about it and then something told me this morning that I should come by here, run it by you, that you might be able to shed some light.
not me.
no light here.
not a flicker.
but I'd be happy to find any Claymore High if they're out there.
right now I got to get back and,...
unless you want to return the favor.
what do you mean?
they woke up this morning, their seven-year-old was gone.
window lock was forced open, but there's no ransom note.
I was about to run out there.
wouldn't mind another set of eyes.
Tyler's room is right down here.
sorry it's such a mess.
they, asked us not to touch anything.
that's all right, Mr. Downey.
were any of your son's things taken?
no.
I... I don't think so.
would you like me to ask my wife?
she would know better than me.
no, that's okay.
we'll, we'll just be here a few minutes.
we thought about putting up bars.
you know, those...
window guards?
some people in the neighborhood have them some don't.
when we bought this place,
paul and I researched how much it would cost to put them on.
but I hated the way they looked.
that number there will get you directly to me 24 hours a day.
we're also monitoring your phone.
and I'd like to keep a detective in your home for a day or so in case we do find a note or get a call.
do you know how many dump sites there are within 50 miles?
a lot?
more than a lot.
they wouldn't even give me a number.
do you know how many bloodhounds are at the city's disposal?
not a lot?
six.
Allison, it's a start.
you may not have found the needle, but at least you found the haystack.
I'm not so sure.
maybe his body hasn't been dumped yet.
how do I even know what I saw has happened already?
I forgot to go to the store and get what I needed for Marie's crib.
good.
I've decided to join the Let's Give Ariel Her Own Room campaign.
Really?
I figure she's going to need a place to stew once she figures out she hates us.
think so?
I do.
I do, too.
okay, great.
let's swing by the furniture store tomorrow and pick up a bed.
if I get home from work early enough, maybe I can even take apart the crib.
call my sister, she if she wants to pick it up.
why do we have to get rid of it?
why can't we just...
put it in the garage?
as what?
a shrine to our child-bearing years?
how is he?
is he going to be all right?
they think he'll get there.
apparently, somebody drugged him, shot him and drove him to that dump site.
Oh, my God, and he survived.
the bullet glanced off the skull without penetrating.
it happens sometimes with small caliber weapons.
leaves a hell of an ugly wound, but it doesn't actually reach the gray matter.
hopefully, when he wakes up, he'll be able to describe the guy who took him.
how soon will that be?
couple hours. Come on.
the doctors are going. Let's go.
I think we're both still in a state of shock, you know?
I mean...
happy shock, but still shock.
it's a miracle.
it's nothing less than a miracle.
and a lot of solid police work, I'm sure.
we're both incredibly grateful.
you know, there are some friends of ours from the parish.
can you just excuse us for just a moment?
no problem.
excuse me.
I should step outside.
I got a couple calls to make.
okay.
I'll just stay here in case he wakes up.
okay.
Tyler.
are you awake?
is this hell?
you're in a hospital.
you were hurt, but you're gonna be okay.
you swear this isn't hell?
absolutely, I swear.
but why would you think that?
because I'm bad.
that's where the bad kids go.
Tyler?
my God!
you're awake?
the closet might be a bit of a problem.
I'm gonna have a lot of my own stuff, so maybe we can get, like three more shelves.
just three shelves?
mom!
I love this room so much.
I'm glad, sweetie.
sYou're going to knock, right?
cause I mean, the new rule, right, privacy?
do you remember when Saturday used to be our day?
vaguely.
mommy!
I don't know.
it still feels sort of... empty.
can we go to the furniture store tomorrow and get some furniture?
maybe a lava lamp and some beanbag chairs?
you know, if you're really so desperate for furniture maybe I could put that crib back together again.
that's not funny, Daddy.
we still got to figure out what to do with it, so what do you say?
we give it to the thrift store or we call my sister?
do we really have to decide right now?
I just didn't think it was that big of a question.
I just want a little time, okay?
it's funny. I thought you'd be in a better mood, what with saving a child's life and all.
I'm in a fine mood.
he said the damndest thing to me when he first woke up and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.
he asked me if he was in hell.
in the kid's defense, he did have a pretty lousy day.
no, that's not what he meant.
he thought he was actually in hell.
that he had died and been sent somewhere to be punished because...
he was a bad person.
and I know how this is going to sound, but...
I got the distinct impression that he thought he deserved it.
that that's where he was supposed to be.
and I can't help but wonder...
how does a terrible thought like that get into a little boy's head?
you belong to your father the devil and you want to carry out your father's desire.
he was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth for there is no truth in him.
and when he lies, he speaks his native language for he is a liar and the father of lies.
thank you for coming in on a Sunday, Mr. and Mrs. Downey.
no, anything to help.
how long is this going to take?
our son's asleep and we'd like to be back at his bedside when he wakes up.
we just need to ask a few questions.
hopefully, rule a few things out.
Mr. and Mrs. Downey.
detective.
I'm sorry.
Allison. Allison Dubois.
how's Tyler doing?
he's much better, thank you.
he's awake for long stretches.
even asked for his crayons this morning.
Mr. and Mrs. Downey, as part of our investigation into your son's abduction, our lab conducted a toxin screen, an analysis of your son's blood.
okay.
and test results seem to indicate that on the night your son was taken, he was given a massive dose of a prescription sleep aid.
what?
no, no, it's important.
ItMEtant hear all this.
just out of curiosity, do either of you use sleeping pills?
I'm sorry, did I miss some...?
are you asking if my wife and I...?
that is what you're asking, isn't it?
please, don't be offended.
in any abduction case, it's routine to eliminate those closest to the child first.
Mrs. Downey?
Yes, I do, actually.
I have two prescriptions at the moment.
would one of them be Zolpidem?
I have no idea.
I don't really know the names.
I just sort of hand the slips of paper over to the pharmacist.
of course.
you'll check for us?
sure.
how about you, Mr. Downey?
ever take sleeping pills?
I'll take one of Marilyn's occasionally.
not often.
rarely.
is this really necessary?
according to your statement, you said that the night your son was abducted, you slept through the night.
is that correct?
Yes, obviously.
you don't remember hearing anything?
not even when Tyler's win ow was being pried open with a crowbar?
isn't all this in my statement?
would you be willing to allow us to draw a sample of your blood?
it'd have to be within the next several hours to actually tell us anyth
I mean, if what we're trying to do is...
eliminate possibilities.
what possibilities?
why do you need to test my blood?
to see if there's any of my prescription in there, Paul.
isn't that right, Detective?
Mr. District Attorney?
you folks serious?
I mean, do you really think that my wife would hurt our son?
no one is making any formal accusations against anyone.
again, we're simply asking for a sample of your blood in the hopes of eliminating...
you can't have any blood.
this is insane and it's hurtful.
you mean to say, if I happened to have taken a sleeping pill that night...
what kind of request is that?
what kind of a theory is that?
we don't mean to offend you.
we're simply hoping for your cooperation, sir.
my cooperation?
Why?
so you can put off looking for the real maniac who took my son?
no, I'm not doing it.
I'm not going to give you an excuse not to stop that animal before he has a chance to stragai
and I want you to apologize to my wife.
it doesn't matter.
okay, fine.
don't.
you call us away from our son's sickbed to level these absurd accusations at us?
shame on all of you.
come on, Marilyn.
I think we need to find an attorney.
you belong to your father the devil.
and you want to carry out your father's desire.
what did you say?
it's from the Book of John.
does that ring a bell?
Marilyn, come on.
pardon me.
I've been waiting for the District Attorney, but I guess you'll do.
I just came from the hospital.
what have you people told them?
why won't they let me see my son, take him home?
what, you have no answer for that?
why am I surprised?
you plucked that scripture out of my head.
I knew right then who you were, who you worked for.
I work for the District Attorney.
and he finds it, we all find it extremely peculiar that you and your husband don't want to cooperate, don't want to help us get to the bottom of this.
you are his parents, he is your child.
you people don't know anything about me or my child.
no, I think we do.
Really?
how well do you know evil?
I know it when I see it.
do you?
do you know how it works?
do you know how it grows?
if you carried it inside you, if you took it to your breast, lived with it every day, had it inside your house...
you are talking about a child.
my child.
and keeping me from him is a mistake, Mrs. Dubois.
I need to bring him home.
and if you truly understood that piece of scripture you quoted, you would recognize the truth of that.
I recognize co you are someone in the midst of a crisis, that you need help, that the evil you think is inside your son is actually inside your head.
and until I am convinced otherwise,
I will do everything I can to be sure that you are nowhere near Tyler.
what's terrifying- no, what's tragic
her sense of conviction is so strong, it's...
so absolute.
I keep thinking about all these couples who are desperate to have a child of their own, and here's this wo.
completely convinced that her son must die, that he's the embodiment of evil.
it makes me want to cry.
so what happens now?
I don't know, we can only compel the hospital to keep him in protective custody for so long.
the father is blind to it all.
I don't know what we can prove in court.
all I know is,
I have to do everything I can to keep that woman away from her son.
how old did you say he was?
I don't know, he's, like...
six or seven, maybe.
sweet.
God, he seemed so sweet.
Tyler.
his name's Tyler.
Tyler.
in situations like this one, it's useful to ask oneself...
would you know how to spot the seeds of resentment before they blossom into the rotten fruit of bad behavior?
Tyler, don't.
Tyler, please, why-why are you doing this?
I don't know.
because I'm mad.
he killed them all, Joe.
he was so unrepentant.
it was like all the sweetness, all the innocence I saw in him, it was just... gone.
is what I'm saying making any kind of sense to you?
I don't know, maybe.
it's 2: 45 in the morning
nothing much makes sense to me at 2: 45 in the morning.
forget it.
I'm sorry, it was selfish of me to wake you.
no, no, I'm sorry, all right?
let me just try and focus.
why don't you start from the beginning.
yesterday...
I dreamt that Marilyn Downey was shooting her son in the head.
now today, I'm dreaming about Tyler, and he's in high school, and he's killing people, dozens of them.
he took out a gun, and he was just slaughtering them.
I- In the future?
in the future.
maybe this kid's supposed to be a long-term project.
maybe you're supposed to help him out even after you lock his mother up.
or maybe I'm not supposed to help him at all.
you can't be serious.
I don't know.
maybe his mother has a touch of what I have.
maybe she's seen what I just saw.
I mean, then it would make some kind of crazy sense.
then you could almost understand why she would do it, why she would feel compelled to try again.
maybe I'm not supposed to stop her.
maybe she's just crazy.
maybe what you're seeing when you dream are the dreams of a crazy woman.
maybe, but how do I know?
how can I be sure?
I don't want to do the wrong thing.
I don't want to make the wrong decision.
the wrong decision?
Allison, you're not seriously suggesting that sending this kid home with his homicidal mother is an option, are you?
I'm not suggesting anything.
I'm just trying to figure it out.
but there's nothing to figure out.
this kid is in danger.
he's seven years old, and he needs your help.
that's all you need to know.
of course.
you're right.
you're right.
glad to be of assistance.
husband, father, moral compass.
we never close.
you have a moment, sir?
Allison. Sure. Come in.
hypothetically, what would you say if I told you I came across a piece of evidence that might help us nail Marilyn Downey for the attempted murder of her son?
hypothetically, I'd tell you that I'm a very happy man.
what would you say if I told you I'd been having dreams about the little boy we're trying to save?
what if I told you that he may grow up to become one of the most evil human beings you or I have ever known, and that by stopping his mother from committing an atrocity in the present, we may very well be setting the stage for an even greater atrocity in the future?
what would you say then?
I
I'd tell you that we have a responsibility to take care of the case that's right in front of us:
saving this child from his very deranged parent.
what if this child grows up to hurt other children?
what if he becomes a killer?
I'd remind you that we have almost a decade to try and stop him.
let's first worry about protecting Tyler Downey from his mother.
then we'll figure out a way to protect society from Tyler Downey.
tell me!
tell you what?
tell me how high you're gonna put that sign on the door.
and I asked you, how tall are you?
mom!
tell her she can't keep me out of her room just because I'm littler than she is!
there are no height requirements in the Dubois house, Ariel.
I'm still putting it on my door.
Hello?
it's me, Allison.
just wanted to let you know that I heard from forensics.
And?
while the gun you found was unmistakably the one used to shoot Tyler Downey, it's never been registered, and was thoroughly cleaned before it was left at that dump site.
there simply are no prints or DNA evidence.
so there's no way to trace it back to Marilyn.
I'm afraid that's not the worst of it.
the Downeys went back to court this morning, and the judge ruled that as soon as Tyler is feeling up to it, he's to be released into his parents' care.
they left the hospital together at 5: 20 this afternoon.
so how long do you think it'll be till we get the call that she finally killed him?
Allison, I think we've made it abundantly clear to Mrs. Downey that we're watching her, that we'll always be watching her.
that's fine and good, sir...
But?
I just don't know how much that means to a crazy person.
where do the leaders of tomorrow come from?
the seeds of their success are sown here in the halls of high schools all across American.
let's listen in on one such success story.
and before we award you your diplomas, let's hear a word from our valedictorian,
Tyler Downey.
in the days leading up to graduation, a number of people have asked me:
is there one person or one event that has inspired you through your high school career?
for me, the person who made the biggest difference was my mom.
you okay?
actually I am okay.
and I think everything's gonna be okay.
I didn't...
good morning. I didn't mean to frighten you.
I was just wondering if...
if I could have a word.
a word"?
talk?
is that really necessary?
isn't a talk really beside the point?
I don't think so.
for one thing,
I am not who you think I am.
in fact, I am probably much more like you than you think.
what do you mean?
you have had dreams about Tyler.
about his future.
so have I.
I don't believe you.
it's true.
that's how I knew about you, about the dump.
that's how I knew about the Scripture that you quoted, right before you shot him.
John. Chapter eight. Verse 44.
I dreamt it.
I dreamt the other dreams that you had about Tyler growing up, about high school...
about the killings.
I came here...
this morning, to tell you your dreams are wrong.
Tyler doesn't have to grow up to be a killer.
he can be a...
an incredible boy, an incredible man.
the key...
is you.
you are the one that makes it possible.
I have seen it.
no.
no.
I know what I know.
I know what I feel.
this is a trick.
you are a demon, and this is a trick.
no, I am no demon.
and there is no trick.
this is a miracle.
this is a second chance, and they come very rarely.
look.
I know what you did in that dump.
but you know what?
no one else does.
no one else in the whole wide world.
most especially, not your son.
just you, me and God.
so I guess why I was sent here, why I'm here is to tell you none of it matters.
it can all be wiped away right here, right now, if you choose it, if you believe it, if you can see Tyler for the incredible boy he really is.
Oh, my God.
you're an angel, aren't you?
no.
I'm just a woman who knows about something horrible and who is willing to forget about it.
if you're willing.
she looks awfully comfortable, doesn't she?
house is all locked up.
ariel finally turned her light out.
it's like she's slept there her whole life.
I guess she was getting a little big for that crib, wasn't she?
maybe just a hair.
you ready for bed?
we're lucky, aren't we?
three amazing kids.
we did all right.
did"? As in past tense?
as in we're done?
the truth is, I don't know.
what's that expression?
it ain't over till it's over "?
Hello?
Allison, I'm sorry to wake you.
it's okay.
what's the matter? What's...
what's up?
I just got a call from the chief of police.
sometime around 11: 00 this evening,
Marilyn Downey swallowed two fistfuls of sleeping pills.
she was pronounced dead about half an hour ago.
no, no.
no, that... that's, that's wrong.
I had a dream.
he turned out to be a really great kid, and she was a big part of that.
he mentioned her...
I,...
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
Marilyn Downey is dead.
just thought you'd want to know.
I actually thought that you'd be relieved.
I mean...
this may be a horrible thing to say, but at least the boy is safe now.
Allison?
it's okay.
I-I just thought...
I guess I hoped...
that things would turn out differently.
I guess I'll see you in the morning.
see you in the morning.
in the days leading up to graduation, a number of people have asked me:
is there one person or one event that has inspired you through your high school career?
for me, the person who made the biggest difference was my mom.
my dad likes to tell me how devoted she was to me.
actually, "obsessed" is the word he often uses to describe it.
we don't talk about it much, but when I was seven, a stranger came into my bedroom and drugged me and shot me and left me for dead.
I barely remember the experience, but, apparently, my mother was devastated by it and felt somehow responsible.
she never forgave herself and apparently consumed by guilt and depression, she took her own life shortly thereafter.
I do remember how badly people felt for me, how concerned everyone was that I would grow up without a mother.
but I'm here to tell you that not a day goes by that I don't think of her, not a day goes by...
that I don't feel her here with me.
and not a day goes by how much it is that we have to get done and how important it is that we do it well.
Thanks, Mom.
I've tried to make you proud.
agent 47, wake up.
agent 47,
I just got word your mission is over.
it's been terminated.
take a drink of this.
sorry, I don't really like the taste.
okay, I hear that.
but it's policy.
guys.
please, no!
I don't like the taste!
I understand, but my hands are tied.
it's policy.
come on now, keep your mouth open.
there's nothing I can do.
I'm just following procedure.
you should feel good.
what you've accomplished
the definition of a job well done.
so...
would you like to see your next mission?
No!
your next assignment involves research into the effects of gravity on the human skull.
my friends here are going to let go of your legs.
and then, we're all going to place bets on how big a spot you leave on the sidewalk.
pretty exciting, huh?
one...
no, no, please!
two...
this isn't what I signed up for!
three.
you okay?
I just had the craziest dream.
did you just hear yourself?
no, I mean, david carradine was in it.
he fell to his death.
these guys, they pushed him off this building and he died.
that's what I dreamt about.
that sounds damn near...
normal.
you think so?
Yeah, absolutely.
to be perfectly honest, I just had a crazy dream, too.
no kidding?
no.
I was on a deserted island, and there was no one there but me and Angelina Jolie.
what are you...
that's not fun.
I thought we were having a conversation.
I don't even find her attractive.
what are you doing?
you're not supposed to read at the table.
mom.
what, Ariel?
nothing.
it's 20 after 7: 00.
why did you let me sleep?
I don't know. You seemed happy.
besides, there's no way I was going to get between you and Angelina.
who's Angelina?
no one.
a friend of your father's.
I take it there are no mentions of grasshopper tumbling to his death in this morning's paper.
no, not a one.
what's that?
what's what?
that.
I find it unsettling at this hour of the morning.
Where's the noise?
Where's the commotion?
Bridgette's reading.
Danielle in Danger?
didn't we read that last night, Bridge?
I know, but I really like it.
Danielle in Danger, Danielle in Distress, Danielle in the Deep End
she has them all.
she reads them all the time.
last time, I found her in the bathroom reading it.
they're good.
you're getting food all over it.
am not.
am not.
and the only reason I'm reading it again is because we don't have any more, and I like it.
and I like that you like it.
I like it, too.
in fact, I'm going to stop by the bookstore on my way home from work tonight.
whatever else Danielle is in,
I'm going to find it.
Really?
sure.
Danielle at the Deli, Danielle in Duluth, Danielle in the Dumps.
wherever danielle has been,
I'm going to find it.
I must apologize for the other evening.
is there some reason you won't look at me?
I mean, other than the obvious.
it must have been a horrible way to die.
I was left with no choice.
the agency was left with no choice.
I mean, we have to preserve the code.
right?
I just hope that someday you find a way to forgive us all.
ma'am, are you getting out?
I'm not a big one to solicit favors.
my wife does charity work with a woman named Jessica Delany.
her brother's been missing for almost two weeks now, and she asked me if I knew someone who could check it out without actually making it a police matter.
I'm sorry, I don't follow.
her brother's apparently something of a wild hair.
hasn't been able to hold down a job for years, pretty eccentric guy.
but it's not like him to not stay in touch.
and as I mentioned, they've not been able to make contact with him for almost two weeks.
she and her husband basically support him.
they're worried sick.
I still don't get it. Why call you?
why avoid the police?
and if you've got to avoid the police, why not just hire a private detective?
they did hire a private detective.
he came up with nothing.
so why not go to the police?
apparently, along with a host of other eccentric habits, this guy's terrified of the police.
they're worried that if law enforcement starts snooping around, he'll never come out of hiding.
I was hoping between the two of you...
sure.
I can do the usual
call the hospitals, the morgue.
and, if you don't mind, this is his address and his landlord's phone number.
the landlord's been told to expect a phone call from a family friend who might show up, want to take a look around.
I'm happy to try.
you want some company?
sure.
I'll call you after I make contact with the landlord.
codes are amazing, aren't they Miss Dubois?
life is a kind of a code, isn't it?
and death.
death is a kind of code, too.
wouldn't you say?
if there's any way we can do it on my way home tonight, say around 8: 00...
Hi, excuse me.
I'm looking for the Danielle books.
Danielle in Danger...
Oh, Beverly Rhodes.
she's a wonderful writer.
right here we have three.
Danielle in Danger, Danielle in Distress and Danielle in the Deep End.
Ah, yes, no.
those are the ones we have.
I was hoping there might be some others.
let's check the computer.
I'm sorry, those are the only three that were published.
um, okay.
are there any more coming?
is old Beverly banging out another one?
I got a little one who's just nuts for these things.
I kind of doubt it.
passed away last year.
and so, Danielle declared,'it pays to be prepared.
with homework done, there's time for fun.
no distress anywhere.'
night, Angel.
night, Daddy.
okay.
you read that good, Daddy.
thank you,
I appreciate that.
I know this can be a tough room.
I love Danielle.
I know you do, sweetheart.
uh, but you know what I was thinking?
I was thinking that maybe we should start reading some other books and give Danielle a rest for a little while, huh?
but I don't want to give Danielle a rest.
I want to read everything there is to read about her.
well, as it turns out,
I think that you have.
there are only three books, honey, you have them all.
Nuh-uh.
sure you do.
you got distress, danger, deep end.
that's all there is.
Nuh-uh.
I know there's another one.
I don't think so, honey.
I'll check again, but I don't think so.
in the meantime, don't let those bedbugs bite.
I won't, Daddy.
must be the maid's year off.
what do you think all this stuff is about?
I don't know.
maybe he's calculated how much to tip the guy who delivered all these pizzas.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, I'm at liberty to do that.
Los angeles, the harmon hotel, day after tomorrow.
no, I can do that.
check in and wait to hear from you.
I got it.
think our boy took a little trip.
drawers are open, clothes seem to be missing.
no toothbrush or toothpaste or comb in the bathroom.
no wallet, no I. D.. No keys.
you all right?
Yeah.
I think he might be in Los Angeles.
the harmon hotel.
okay.
anything else?
Yeah.
I think he might look a lot like David Carradine.
you awake?
Oh, yeah.
what are you doing?
is that Daddy's work computer?
you know you're never supposed to play with Daddy's work computer.
I'm sorry.
how long were you there?
I don't know.
a little while, I guess.
what did the misfit of science do now?
none of your beeswax.
who cares.
can I have some microwave oatmeal?
Yeah.
you left the bathroom a mess again.
did not.
your underwear is on the counter.
your towel is in the tub, and you don't flush.
do, too.
do not.
do, too.
do not.
do, too.
fine, then whose poo was it in the toilet this morning, huh?
not my poo.
was, too.
not my poo.
was, too.
not my poo.
was, too!
can we not... discuss poo at the kitchen table?
thank you.
can you come here for a minute?
what's up?
I need to cook something for one minute.
okay.
you were looking for me?
Yeah, come in.
so I've known you for what, little over a year now?
and I have to confess, that every time one of your things comes true.
what are you talking about?
Jessica Delany's brother?
he was registered at the Harmon hotel in Los Angeles.
I was authorized by the family early this morning to send detective Scanlon out there.
so...
thank you.
I'm very appreciative, and I just wanted to tell you so.
have you given any thought to our pblem?
how do we thwart these terrorists?
how do we stop them before they strike?
who are you?
what are you?
are you a ghost?
are you a hallucination?
are you a dream?
you understand how these terrorists operate, don't you?
when a terrorist needs to communicate, he or she requests a password.
they can do this from anywhere, from a payphone, from a cell phone, an email.
the means is unimportant.
what is important is they are then sent a password over the phone, over the internet, over a pager, not terribly secure.
but what they do with that password is they enter it into a device like this, which uses a complex algorithmic formula to create a new password, the real password, a fluid password, a password that changes every six seconds.
I'm asking you please sit down and crack the algorithmic formula that makes this conversion possible.
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.
I think you have the wrong person.
are you not the one who said Harmon hotel?
Allison, it's a simple "thank you."
just accept it gracefully, and get the hell out of here so I can do my work.
yeah... yes, yes, of course, sir.
you think they're all watching you, don't you?
that's the paranoia kicking in.
you have drugs for that.
don't worry about them.
me and my people will take care of them.
all you need to be thinking about is code decode, code decode, code decode.
code decode!
code decode!
code decode!
Hi.
Hey. You all right?
you sound stressed.
you called me. What's going on?
I'm just trying to figure something out.
I'm transferring files from my laptop to my office computer, and there are some files here that I don't recognize.
um, did you maybe...
Bridgette was playing with it this morning.
I'm sorry-- I stopped her.
I don't think she had a chance to do any real harm.
it's okay.
as long as I know what it is.
I didn't know whether to print it out or throw it away.
listen, I got to go.
the coast is clear.
the coast is clear?
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry to put you through all this.
it's really horrible, their eyes following you like that.
convinced they're all watching you, all after you.
I... suspect you're a lot like me, smart enough to know it's not really happening, but still, the heart starts to race, the adrenaline starts to kick in.
it's impossible not to be sucked into it.
so these are delusions?
it's all life, right?
I mean, I'm not really sure.
I'm a mathematician, not a psychiatrist, but I strongly suspect that everything I'm seeing, everything I'm feeling, some of it probably isn't there.
so these things that I'm seeing, these things that I'm feeling...
you're sending them to me?
I think so.
even that man who keeps talking about codes?
so what are these?
are these memories or fantasies?
all sorts of things.
probably a little bit of everything.
I'm really sorry.
you know, you look like a famous actor.
Really?
my goodness.
anyone I would recognize?
do you know who David Carradine is?
of course.
I imagine I'm him a lot.
lots of guys.
lots of different times...
but him a lot.
what are you doing in here with the lights off?
tell me you're all right.
I'm all right.
Yeah.
well, you just did me a favor, now I'm going to do you one
go home.
take the rest of the day off.
that's not necessary.
okay, it's not a favor.
it's an order.
see you tomorrow.
movie star guy.
movie star guy.
movie star guy?
I need you to wake up.
there's someone on the phone for you.
mom.
didn't you hear me?
I said "mom, there's someone on the phone for you.
sorry, honey, I must have dozed off.
Hello?
greetings from L. A.
what do you want to hear, the good, the bad, or the weird?
well, it can't get any weirder than it's been here, so start wherever you'd like.
well, the good news is he was here, all right.
the bad news is, apparently, he jumped off the roof of this place two nights ago.
they've been trying to I. D. him ever since.
I'm waiting for a car now to take me to the airport pick up the family, escort them to the morgue.
don't laugh, but are you sure he jumped?
which brings us to the weird part.
Allison, this guy was as nutty as a fruitcake.
his bathroom counter was covered with prescription antipsychotic medications,
he was a textbook paranoid schizophrenic who went off his meds and jumped off a diving board that wasn't there.
I'm just curious.
any of the people there, any of the people who saw him, any of the people at the hotel, did anyone happen to mention that he looked like...
a movie star?
what?
nothing.
she was no fool, while in the pool.
Danielle played smart, followed all the rules.
she made safety her friend, while in the deep end.
you read that good, daddy.
my biggest fan.
sleep tight.
I'll see you in the morning.
good night, Daddy.
good night, sweetie.
close your eyes.
good girl. Okay.
daddy?
Yes, sweetie.
when are we going to read the new one?
the new one what, babe?
the new Danielle.
honey, I explained that to you yesterday.
there is no new Danielle.
there's only three Danielle books, and we have them all.
Nuh-uh. There's another one.
no, sweetie, only three.
the woman who wrote them
she's not writing them anymore.
she's done with Danielle.
Nuh-uh.
there's another one.
she told it to me.
I wrote it on your computer.
so, where's your laptop?
at the office. Of course.
well, don't stress about it.
you'll go to work, you'll print out the file, and you'll see.
how can you be so calm?
I mean, what choice do I have?
what would be so terrible if you opened your computer and discovered that you do have a new Danielle book?
what would be so terrible?
don't you find it at all disturbing that your daughter may have taken dictation from a dead woman?
what's the matter with me?
look at who I'm asking.
what does that mean?
I don't know.
I just... this is just one of those times when I think I would have preferred if they'd inherited your allergy to ragweed.
I don't mean that. I'm just...
she just turned seven.
I'd like to believe that I have a little bit of control over who her friends are, who she spends her time with.
maybe you're jumping the gun.
you know, you may very well get to work, turn on that computer, and find you have nothing but gobbledygook.
that would be a tremendous relief.
is there any word from Scanlon?
her sister and her husband identified the body a couple of hours ago.
apparently, he was a phd candidate at stanford.
he started hearing voices and seeing things in 1997.
he was doing pretty good on meds till 9/11.
then he became convinced that he held the key to some sort of coding device.
so he went off his meds so he could concentrate on his mathematical equations.
he'd disappear for days, pop up in other cities.
she pleaded with him to go back on his prescriptions, but he said that...they interfered with his thought process.
his government work.
that's sad.
I'm gonna meet with the sister and her husband tomorrow.
I can't even imagine what they're going through.
hello.
Danielle chose not to play, Danielle felt bad that day.
her smile was gone, her spirit wan.
her best friend had moved away.
well, darling, there's no gobble in that gook.
I-I... I don't know what to say.
I'm late for a meeting.
I don't know what to say.
well, what is there to say?
oprah has a book club. Why shouldn't bridgette?
Hey, think about it.
there are a lot of great, dead authors.
she could channel a new Hemingway novel, a new Dickens.
imagine. A tale of three cities.
c-can we discuss this tonight?
can we discuss this when I get home?
I suppose. Danielle will keep.
and the author certainly isn't going anywhere.
sure. Tonight.
thank you.
have a good meeting.
I'll try.
nice of you to finally show up.
sorry.
it's okay. Nice people.
Jessica Delany's very anxious to meet the woman whose good old-fashioned detective work helped her find her brother.
this is Allison Dubois.
she's the investigator who figured out that your brother was in Los Angeles.
I'm so sorry about how things turned out.
I'm so sorry about your brother.
I appreciate that. Thank you.
um, this is my husband David.
um, can you hold on a minute?
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
it's the mortuary.
you are, um...
agent 47, wake up.
Allison. Allison dubois.
you saw him throw his brother-in-law off the roof of that hotel?
Yes.
well, no. Actually, I saw him throw David Carradine off the roof of that hotel.
actually, it was two guys he hired.
but I don't think that's an important distinction.
okay.
now I am confused.
how exactly does David Carradine figure into any of this?
well, I'm not sure, but my best guess is, the night that David Delany's brother-in-law died, his spirit started sending me messages.
and unfortunately, they were the messages of a mentally ill man who's been off his medication for some time.
so, the things that he showed me were the way that he perceived them.
the world that he lives in
he's the star of his own movie.
he's the superhero.
he's a man fighting an unbeatable foe.
and of course, he made himself look like a movie star.
I can't dismiss the fact that he cast his brother-in-law as the villain.
that in his mind, in his delusion, this is the man who betrayed him.
this is the man responsible for his death.
delusion is the key word here.
he didn't look like a movie star, or a superhero in life, and he wasn't one.
and insofar as we can determine, he wasn't doing any work for the government, wasn't actually cracking terrorist codes.
now, I'll happily ask, but I'm reasonably certain that the gentleman in that conference room has a perfectly logical explanation for where he was the night of his brother-in-law's fall.
after all, he is the one who's been supporting him for the last five years.
and according to jessica, they were very clo.
actually spent a fair amount of time together.
is this really something you want us to pursue?
I don't know.
you're right. It's crazy.
he jumped, but it's just...
the movie's always more interesting than the truth.
Allison, you were in this guy's apartment.
you saw all that nonsense he was working on.
these are nice people.
they're already in a fair amount of pain.
I'd rather not go in there and open this particular can of worms unless you're absolutely certain.
no. No, you're right.
we shouldn't.
what are those?
personal effects.
we were holding onto them as possible evidence.
Jessica wants the family photos, a scrapbook, and her husband wants to hold on to the math.
the math?
the stuff on the walls.
he's a finance guy.
apparently, he's fascinated by the stuff.
uh, could you hold on to those for a couple of days so I could take a look at them
the math, I mean?
I was half hoping
I'd read this stuff and convince myself it was all a product of Bridgette's imagination, but I just don't see her coming up with words like "wan.
I couldn't even finish it,
I was so...
she wants me to come in there and read it to her.
okay.
okay? What...?
you really think this is okay, Al?
I don't know.
I don't think I should be doing anything to encourage all this.
all what?
if you really believe this came from the woman who wrote the Danielle books, how lovely, how flattering she heard our child's plea for more, and she chose to answer it.
if you can't get your head around that, that's fine, too.
all it means is that Bridgette is precocious.
she took the three books that she loved, and she wrote one for herself.
either way...
wait a second.
you really think that Bridgette might have come up with this herself?
kids have done crazier things.
hell, maybe that's what inspiration is.
some original thought, and some desire, and a willingness to listen to the voices of the people who came before us, whispering to us, and encouraging us.
why are you looking at me like that?
you think I'm crazy, right?
no.
I think you're brilliant.
I think you're beautiful.
I know you're crazy.
and I've learned there's no point in arguing with a crazy person.
where are you going?
I'm going to read to Bridgette.
I'll read to Bridgette.
I need you to look at something.
some stuff I brought from the office.
okay. What is this?
it's math, I think.
you think?
I think, like you think I'm beautiful.
Danielle was happy once more.
someone new had moved in next door.
ariel was her name.
she had great toys and games.
Danielle would be lonely no more.
Yay.
you read that really good, Mommy.
almost as good as daddy.
thank you, honey.
so, ariel, huh?
she's the one that makes Danielle feel better?
Yeah. Well, it's a pretty common name, Mom.
I'm sorry that I yelled at you for using Daddy's computer.
but it's daddy's, and we shouldn't play with it.
I could take you to the family room and show you how to use that one.
I mean, in case there's another story a writer wants you to put down.
that would be really great, mommy, 'cause I'm hearing stories in my head all the time.
I bet you are. Give me a kiss.
thank you for the sugar.
Oh, no, joe.
it's worse than we thought.
not only might she be a touch psychic,
I fear deeply that she may be...
creative.
you didn't find another one, did you?
come here, I want to show you something.
what am I looking at?
wait a second,
I've seen one of those before.
what is that?
it's called a pass code generator.
it's used with secure computer networks
the kind that big corporations with lots of sensitive data have, like banks and investment houses.
okay...
right, so let's say that you want to let your employees use the internet to access your network from home or when they're on the road.
obviously, you're going to want to secure things with a password, a password that's going to change relatively frequently.
now, what happens is, that every few minutes or so, the company server sends out a page to everybody's pager or cell phone.
wow, this sounds terribly familiar.
now, to guard against anybody intercepting the page or the text message, they issue everyone...
one of these. One of these.
sorry.
right. There's a program that's hard-wired into this thing that runs a series of fancy mathematical transformations, ultimately kicking out the new password.
the new password...the real password?
for banks, financial institutions?
well, that's what this particular model is for, yeah.
of course, if you don't have one of these, and you happen to be a friggin' genius, then you can also do all of this.
you just lost me.
well, all of this...
equals that.
okay, one more time for those of us who had to repeat math in summer school.
he was calculating pass codes.
what do you mean?
he was doing the same thing that that little gadget does, only by hand.
so someone, somewhere, could get into a computer that they otherwise couldn't get into.
presumably.
were you just saying something to me about Bridgette?
Oh... yeah.
Yeah, wherever that story came from,
I really don't think it came to her whole.
there is a lot of Bridgette in it.
I think she's just smart.
like her dad.
Hey, wait a second, where you going?
that was just getting good.
when your brother first fell to his death in los angeles, after the local authorities were able to identify him, they all assumed
we all assumed--given his history of mental problems, that his death was self-inflicted.
that he simply jumped.
but since then, some new evidence has come to light that would seem to suggest that...
he was pushed off that roof.
very much against his will.
I'm sorry, what are we looking at here?
financial statements from an investment account under your wife's name
I'm sorry,
I'm confused.
did you not just tell me you suspect that my brother was murdered?
what could that possibly have to do with my financial statements?
I assure you, we believe there is a connection.
well, I certainly hope that's true, these records are private.
when I discover how they came to be in your possession...
those documents were provided to us by Wilke and Price.
they were more than willing to cooperate once we alerted them to the possible irregularities in the account.
what irregularities?
as you can see, the account was opened with an initial deposit of $50, 000.
today, barely eight months later...
it's worth over four million.
that's quite a rate of return, wouldn't you say?
I-I don't know what to tell you.
my husband is very gifted when it comes to making money.
he just is.
but I still don't understand what any of this had to do with my brother.
we checked with your investment firm, and they discovered the damndest thing.
at 4: 01 eastern time, right after the markets closed on wall street, whoever was handling your account would electronically access your holdings and change them to reflect the day's winners.
add some gainers, drop some losers.
pretty good investment strategy...
if you can get away with it.
well, I'm baffled.
darling, have you been reading your statements when they come in the mail?
I don't know whether the bank has made some kind of mistake in our favor or, as you say, for some reason somebody did...
do something but, either way, the money isn't ours and, naturally, we'll return it.
that's very big of you.
no, absolutely, that's the right thing to do.
it's the only thing to do.
you were once an employee of Wilke and Price, weren't you.
Yes, as a senior vice president, why?
none of you are suggesting that I had anything to do with this?
that's absurd.
even if I wanted to manipulate my wife's account, how was I going to go about it?
I had no access to it.
I was no longer with the company.
wouldn't be that tough.
not if you had one of these.
Yes, but I don't.
when I left the firm,
I surrendered my pass-code device.
so you see, your theory makes no sense.
unless, of course, you happened to have a brother-in-law with the mathematical skills necessary to defeat the security safeguards that the pass code generator was designed to protect.
a brother-in-law who could be easily manipulated.
who could be led to believe that he wasn't involved in anything illegal.
that, in fact, he was essential to the security of this country.
but what do you do with a guy like that?
a relative?
a guy who might talk?
maybe you could tell him that the government has a new assignment for him in Los Angeles.
book him a room at the hotel, make sure that he spends enough time there so that everybody sees him talking to himself, behaving strangely.
so that when he ends up a puddle on the sidewalk, they don't even question why.
darling, this isn't true.
none of it's true.
I have nothing further to say until I speak with my lawyer.
that won't be a problem.
actually, I have him waiting outside.
I'll bring him in.
pardon me, sir?
are you're David Delany's attorney?
Yes, I am.
well, they'd like you to step inside now.
Oh, really?
and you are?
have we met before?
no. I don't believe we have.
I have to go pick up my kids, but you could go through the door right there.
Oh, sir?
just one more thing.
uh, they'll probably arrest you.
just a heads up.
very well done.
thank you.
how are you doing?
good, I think.
better all the time.
still worried about my sister.
but good.
feeling a little silly for looking like this.
maybe the next time we meet...
I'll...
look more like myself.
I'll look forward to that.
Allison: Grief.
envy.
love.
most basic human emotions are communicated in ways others can easily understand.
through words, behavior, facial expressions.
and then... there's fear.
I believe that, when people are alone and vulnerable and afraid, they put out a sort of distress signal.
an alarm of sorts.
an S. O.S.
it's not visible or audible.
at least not to everyone.
just certain people.
what are you doing, huh?
Hey, it's Saturday.
we got another half hour or so.
lay back down. Hmm?
I don't think I can.
I...I saw a girl slip and fall.
I got to call somebody. What?
got to find the phone book.
what are you talking about?
slipped and fell?
now you're doing slips and falls?
what happened to kidnappings and assaults and murders?
it's a Saturday.
Yes. Mariposa State Park.
she looked like she was around 18.
she had long blond hair.
she was wearing a white T-shirt with the name of some sorority on it.
no. I didn't actually witness her fall.
ARIEL: No, it's not. BRIDGETTE: Yes, it is.
well, you have to show someone.
like who?
mom or Dad.
but what if I don't want to?
well, you'd better.
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?
your baby sister's still asleep.
what's this?
it's a class project.
what kind of class project?
well, we're doing this art project about what our parents do for a living.
and I'm doing mine about Mom.
that's nice, Bridge.
tell him what it means.
what do you mean, "what it means"?
it's her job.
okay, I get that. I'm just curious.
what do you think Mom's job is?
well, she's a guesser and a dreamer.
one more time?
well, she makes guesses about things, and sometimes she dreams about things.
and she tells all this stuff to District Attorney Devalos, and he puts people in jail.
I'll be right back.
no, Lee, I know the park is not your jurisdiction, but I called Park Services, and I couldn't seem to get anyone's attention.
well, can you just give him a call?
okay. Can you call me back?
Thanks.
Hey, have you seen this class project of Bridgette's?
that collage thing with the photographs and pictures from magazines? No. Not yet.
you might want to take a look at this thing.
she's got some pretty eerie ideas about what you do for a living.
eerie crazy or eerie accurate?
that's a pretty tough call.
in the kitchen?
we still doing that Family Day thing?
Yeah. Remember? We decided to go to the mall.
the mall? It's so sunny out.
Yeah, well, it's Arizona, Allison.
it's always sunny.
well, I know. It...The mall's so stuffy.
they've been there a million times.
I kind of want to do something outdoors.
experience nature.
nature? What do you mean?
I don't know.
I thought maybe we could go to the park.
go for a hike.
climb some rocks.
wow, honey. Is this what you think Mommy does for work?
Uh-huh.
joe: It's great up here, huh?
it's beautiful!
it's boring.
I don't understand.
what happened to the mall?
didn't we vote?
isn't this a democracy?
what's so great about the mall?
what do they have at the mall?
you're joking, right?
how about clothes?!
well, I hate clothes!
well, there is something wrong with you.
mom, there's an emergency.
we have to call the hospital.
this little girl is not my sister.
mom?
you know, it was your idea to come up here in the first place.
the very least you can do is participate in the stimulating conversation.
what are you looking for?
you guys figure out a place to have a picnic.
I'll...I want to look at something.
okay, I'm confused.
what is it about that sign that you do not understand?
I'll be right back.
terrific.
BRIDGETTE: I don't get it.
isn't Mommy a guesser and a dreamer?
there is no job called a guesser or a dreamer.
Bridgette, Mom works for the District Attorney's office with a lot of other people.
she helps them investigate things- figure things out.
so she's a "figurer"?
Allison: Daddy's right.
I guess I'm kind of an investigator.
you don't dream?
well, sure, I do, but that's not uncommon.
lots of people dream about their work once in a while.
I dream. I think. I feel. I explore.
and then I follow my instincts.
which, I guess, is what a lot of investigators do.
Oh. So, Sherlock, did you find whatever it was you were looking for?
no. In fact, I did not, which is probably a good thing.
anybody want to play Frisbee?
sure. Marie and I will play, as long as you promise to try and throw it in our general direction.
I can't help it if the Frisbee doesn't pay attention.
Oh, girls, be careful over there by the rocks.
look out for snakes.
hmm. An investigator, huh?
and what case are we working on today, Magnum Dubois?
you figured that out, huh?
you're not the only one with instincts around here.
that dream that I had...
slipping? Falling?
I do recall that.
this is where it happened.
at least this is where I thought it happened.
damn accident victims.
you just can't count on them.
that's why I tell all my investigator wives to stick with crime victims.
kidnap. Murder. Rape.
horrific, but dependable.
BRIDGETTE: Mom! Dad! I found something!
joe: What you got there, kiddo?
maybe there's money in it.
where did you find this?
over there.
Ariel! Quick!
come on.
sit down. Sit down.
stay here while your daddy goes and looks.
what's going on, Al?
you want to tell me what I'm looking for?
the rest of her.
I hate family day.
can we go photocopy my face again?
you know what, honey,
I don't want to walk away right now.
I mean, if your father wants to take you...
you know, we've already got about six photocopies of your face, Bridge.
tongue in, tongue out, finger in nose, finger in ear.
why don't we just...
I'll be right back.
DEVALOS: Her name is Amy Asher. 18 years old.
she was an out-of-state freshman from Wheaton, Illinois.
that's her, that's the girl I dreamt about, I called you about.
wait a second, you dreamt about this girl?
you actually saw her being sexually assaulted and strangled to death and then you had a conversation with Detective Scanlon about it before it ever happened?
no, I dreamt about a girl climbing really high to try to spray paint a boulder and then slipping. When she called we had no idea this thing was going to end up like this.
I called Park Services, they went looking for a girl disabled by a fall, never found her.
hold on.
you guys know more about this than I do.
she was sexually assaulted and strangled?
according to the girls we spoke to over at the sorority, she was sent to paint Skull Rock as an initiation task.
she left her house around 4: 30 this morning.
okay. I had my dream right after sunrise.
based on some very preliminary work, the folks over at forensics are saying it looks like she fell, she broke her left ankle and then was dragged to where your husband found her.
they believe that's where she was sodomized, raped and then eventually, strangled to death.
the attack was apparently quite savage.
how much did your kids actually see?
nothing, thank goodness.
Joe got there first.
well, Bridgette found her backpack.
it was about 15 yards from where Joe found her body.
we might need to interview the both of them at some point.
of course.
what are the chances?
a girl falls, breaks her ankle and the one person who happens to cross her path is a sexual predator and killer.
let's get out of here.
maybe we can salvage a little of our Saturday.
anything you can tell me?
not here, not now.
you okay?
Yeah. It was pretty grisly.
it was pretty awful.
her face...
I'm so sorry.
I guess you were right, we should've gone to the mall after all.
it's not your fault.
I don't know, I don't understand.
what? You don't understand what?
Oh, I'm just thinking about my instincts.
I had an instinct about this girl slipping and falling.
and how besides the point it all seems right now.
it's kind of like sensing that you're sailing into a little rain when you're onboard the Titanic.
okay, I get it now. Mom's an investigator.
but you know what's weird?
your face?
Nuh-uh. Us going to the park.
we never go to that park.
just 'cause we never go there doesn't make it weird.
well, don't you think it's weird that we went hiking?
lots of people go hiking.
my friend Rachel Donnelly goes hiking all the time.
Yeah, but we don't.
what's your point, doofus?
and don't think I didn't notice you didn't brush your teeth.
I mean the one time that we go hiking, we find a dead body.
don't you think that is weird?
I think you're weird.
I think this conversation is weird.
well, think about it. Doesn't it seem like everywhere Mommy goes she finds dead bodies?
she told you, she's an investigator.
investigators are always finding dead bodies.
today was just a coincidence.
I hope so, because
I don't want to grow up and have kids and have to explain why their grandma always had dead bodies hanging around.
do you forgive me?
huh?
do you forgive me?
I forgive you.
what did you do?
I dragged you all to the park today.
Yeah, well, it still beats going to the mall.
putting you and the kids so close to all that ugliness.
I still can't believe I did that.
I can't believe you saw what you saw.
Hey, I can't believe I saw what I saw.
and frankly, if I never see another naked girl with that look of horror permanently etched on her face, that's just fine with me.
as for the kids, Bridgette told me that she wants a coffee machine of her own for her birthday.
darling, I swear, there's nothing for you to apologize for.
just... it'd be nice to get a little sleep.
yeah? Lee, it's Allison.
I'm sorry to wake you. I need your help with something.
what's going on?
what's wrong?
I had a dream.
this girl was driving through the desert.
her car ran out of gas and her cell phone doesn't work.
okay.
well, what do we do?
what do you mean, what do we do?
it sounds like a AAA problem to me.
I told you, her cell phone doesn't work.
Allison, look, I think you're amazing, it's just... after what happened today...
I don't know, there must be some reason I saw it.
it has to have some importance.
well, that's fine, but...
I guess I could call the highway patrol.
okay.
tell me anything specific you might have seen.
describe the girl, describe the car, describe the road.
: kill me now.
it's Sunday.
come on, who the hell is calling this hour on a Sunday?
Hello?
that girl you called me about a couple hours ago, you said she was driving a silver sedan?
Uh-huh.
I think we found the car.
trucker called it in last night. Looks like it just ran out of gas on the side of the desert highway about 40 miles outside the city.
what about the girl?
Yeah.
??
we're still waiting to hear from forensics.
they think that he offered her a ride, raped her and then strangled her.
is it just me or does this kind of thing seem to be going around?
I know, I thought the same thing.
what?
maybe it's broken.
I'm sorry, you lost me.
: I don't know.
when these girls popped into my dreams, it was like I was receiving distress signals or something.
I saw them alone, they were in need of help.
they were not in danger of being killed.
wait, you still saw them.
you just...
you didn't get the whole story.
that's the thing- I felt like I did.
I felt like from the moment they came into my dreams, these girls, their lives were not in danger.
they were just stuck, they were stuck on the side of the road needing gas, stuck on an out-of-the-way trail with a broken ankle.
so? So...
how did he know? How did he find them?
I don't know.
luck?
Maybe- Maybe we're jumping the gun here, Allison.
I mean, we can't even be sure that both of these attacks were committed by the same person.
I mean, think about it, some homicidal maniac gets this lucky twice.
no, I know.
you're right, it makes no sense.
it doesn't make it any less tragic, but...
looks like it's going to rain.
what do you want to do with the girls?
BRIDGETTE: Mom, I'm ready.
coming.
I'm coming.
you're late, Ms. Dubois.
we're gonna have to mark you tardy.
I'll have my mommy write me a note on Monday.
fire when ready.
my mom's an investigator for the District Attorney.
the District Attorney is a lawyer who works for the people.
when someone is arrested for murdering somebody, the District Attorney is supposed to prove they did it.
this is lucky because it seems like everywhere my mom goes she's always finding dead bodies.
a lot of times my mom's instincts tell her where to be to find dead bodies.
just the other day, my mom said, 'Let's go for a hike.'
we never go on hikes, but...
: Oh, boy.
Yep, I'm going to go get that.
joe: Hello.
good morning, sir.
mommy doesn't see dead bodies wherever she goes.
sure you do. Don't you remember?
that's what you told me.
no, honey, I never told you that.
Yes, you did.
you said you listened to your instincts, they tell you where to go, and that's where the dead bodies are.
it's your boss.
hold on.
hello.
sorry to bother you on a wet Sunday, but apparently the press is starting to grab ahold of this thing, and the deputy mayor was wondering if we could come in and give her a quick briefing on everything we know.
when do you need me?
they gave him a name?
Oh, yeah.
why do they think it's one guy?
honestly, I don't think there's a lot of actual thinking.
what makes you say that?
it's not the greatest link in the world, but when we found that girl on the side of the Sonoran Desert Highway, there was a large recent oil spot almost directly behind her car.
we checked her undercarriage and it's tight as a drum.
so we went back to Mariposa State Park and wouldn't you know it?
we found another large oil spot in one of the parking spaces located in the lot closest to where that sorority girl was found.
and that proves?
nothing.
Lee, you know as well as I do that you can't even be sure that oil came from the same car.
as a clue, it's worthless.
it's not like you can trace the oil back to its owner.
Hey, I'm not telling you it's not a straw.
and I'll be the first to admit that we are grasping here.
this is ridiculous.
has anyone looked at a map?
did you see how far apart these two incidents occurred?
about 60 miles.
60 miles.
in my opinion, Ms. Deputy Mayor, the only responsible thing to do is to call a press conference and reassure the city that in all likelihood, these were two tragic, separate and random acts of violence committed by two completely different individuals...
that the police department is doing everything it can to find the guilty parties, but that we are not looking at a murder spree being perpetrated by some psychotic Bad Samaritan.
Hey, this is Cindy. Leave a message.
Cin, hey. It's Taylor. What's up?
so, you know how my parents went away this weekend and I was totally psyched 'cause they finally let me stay home alone this time?
um, well, maybe it's not as cool as I thought.
cause honestly, it's kind of creepy being here all alone.
and I guess 'cause I watched this horror movie on cable that was hella scary and now there's all this lightning and thunder and...
this is going to sound kind of lame, and don't even repeat this to anyone 'cause if you do, I'll, like, totally deny it, but maybe you could come crash here tonight?
I know it's so weak, but I just don't want to be here solo.
um, so anyway, it's 11: 35 right now.
um, you can call me at home, not my cell.
it's 555-0178.
come on, come on, come on, pick up.
TAYLOR: Hello.
Taylor, hi. You don't know me. My name is Allison Dubois.
I work with the District Attorney's office in Phoenix.
don't ask me how, but I know that you are home all alone.
now I need you to listen.
who is this?
my name is Allison Dubois.
did Cindy tell you to call?
no, Cindy didn't tell me to call.
I told you my name is Allison Dubois.
I think you might be in a lot of danger.
I need you to give me your address.
and I need you to go around and make sure all your doors and windows are locked.
Hello?
this isn't funny.
I'm not trying to be funny!
I need your address. I need to know that you are going around and locking all your doors and windows so I can hang up with you and I can call the police and get them out there. Hello? Hello?
woman: Phoenix Metro Police.
what's the nature of your emergency?
my name is Allison Dubois.
I work with the Phoenix District Attorney's office.
I need the address of a house whose phone number is 555-0178.
listen, butt brain, do not call here.
Yeah. Who's this?
this is 911 dispatch.
we have a car coming your way.
a car? Why?
saying an intruder was trying to break into your house.
Hello?
hold on. Don't hang up.
I want to check some stuff.
who was this who called you?
I don't know, ma'am.
should I cancel the car or would you like me to stay on the line with you?
stay on the line. Stay on the line.
no problem. I'm right here.
are you okay, ma'am?
I'm here. Just don't hang up. Keep talking.
Hey, early bird.
what you doing, worm-catching?
he struck again.
16-year-old girl home alone.
I called her right before he got there, then I called the police.
apparently, he was just about to break in, but she surprised him and he fled.
there was an oil slick outside her house at the curb.
it's definitely the same guy.
but that makes no sense.
I still don't get it.
how does he find them?
it can't be luck.
three vulnerable, isolated girls, totally different parts of the city three times in a row.
how could he have known that this last girl was alone?
nobody could have known that but you.
or somebody like me.
yesterday, the Mayor's office assured us that the killing spree was over, that the two weekend murders had no connection.
today, a third apparent attack, and now a bizarre new twist in the serial murder spree that has all of Phoenix in a state of panic.
cause someone was coming.
just like that, out of the blue?
you know who she was?
well, why did you believe her?
um, I didn't at first, but then she said she worked for the District Attorney's office and it sounded kinda serious.
and then she said she was going to send the police.
and a minute later the police were calling.
and did you get this woman's name?
um, I only got her first name- Andrea or Allison.
something like that.
who was this mystery caller?
and whoever she was, how was she able to warn the young victim.
department know more than they're letting on? Stay tune...
every channel's running a version of the same thing.
the papers are full of it, too.
I just got off the phone with the Mayor.
everyone wants an explanation.
I think we have to give them one.
hello. Thank you for coming. My name is Allison Dubois and I work as a freelance consultant and investigator for the District Attorney's office.
there's been much recent speculation about who in the District Attorney's office called Taylor Greene to warn her that someone was trying to break into her house, and how this caller obtained this information.
you might be surprised by my answer- luck.
I'd been working late on, of all things, the Bad Samaritan case and I was driving home from work when I passed Ms. Greene's house.
I saw a figure lurking about the perimeter of the house and it looked like a burglar, so I called 911.
they promised to send a police car.
concerned about the safety of whoever might have been in the house,
I requested a reverse phone number lookup from Ms. Greene's street address and was immediately connected to her home phone.
like I said- luck.
but let me take this moment to clear up another misconception.
we cannot be certain at this time that the man who fled Ms. Greene's house is the same person responsible for this weekend's two murders.
naturally, we're using Ms. Greene's description.
thank you.
mom, you lied.
I didn't lie.
we don't know that those three incidents were the work of one man.
everybody has an opinion.
I have an opinion, but since the Mayor went ahead and told everybody that he didn't think there was a connection...
that's not what she meant.
you weren't working last night.
you didn't drive by that girl's house.
why did you say that you did?
how did you know that that man would break in?
girls, Mommy works for someone.
when you work for someone...
Ariel's right.
I lied, and that is really not something that I want to teach you girls.
and to answer your question, I don't know.
I just did.
that happens to me sometimes.
I see something.
I just know things.
I just sense things.
I don't get to pick and choose what they are.
and I have learned most people don't understand it.
so it's not something that I talk about.
it's not something that I try to explain.
do you girls understand what Mommy's saying to you?
I know you girls know what I'm talking about.
I think a little bit of what I have has rubbed off on you.
I know that you've felt this thing.
but you have to trust me when I tell you very few people ever experience it.
and very few people understand it.
which is why, for the moment at least, only you and Daddy and a couple of people at work know.
and I'm asking you, just for the time being, don't tell your friends.
don't talk about it at school.
don't share it with anyone.
is that an order?
no, honey. No.
it's just a suggestion.
it's just a hope.
no parent has the final word on what their children say about them.
it's just...
people just don't understand it.
and I really don't want them treating you differently because of the way I am.
now, come on, give me a kiss. Let's get ready for bed.
what do you think?
about what?
tomorrow is Bridgette's report.
if she's going to say something, tomorrow's the day.
I don't know. What do you think?
I thought you were amazing.
I thought you said everything just about perfectly.
I guess the rest is up to her.
and I think I'm all right with that.
I wish I didn't lie.
well, you didn't lie.
you told a fib.
and you didn't fib to the girls.
you told them the truth.
and I think that is what they're going to remember.
I hope you're right.
what's so funny?
today. This day.
for all of my "gifts,"
I didn't see this one coming.
helping that girl last night.
Devalos calling a press conference.
the conversation with the girls.
this life thing is a tricky business.
keep looking for a batting order, a table of contents...
something to let you know what's happening next.
hello.
man: Is this Allison Dubois?
uh, may I ask who's calling?
you don't know me.
I just saw you on the news, and I wanted to call and tell you how impressed I was.
who is that?
I'm sorry... didn't catch your name.
that's because I didn't tell you my name.
that was quite a story.
the one about passing the house and seeing me.
it's him.
really, who is this?
you tell me.
you're the dreamer.
you're the one who sees things.
it was funny and strange watching TV and seeing someone else who had it.
spent my whole life looking.
never found anyone.
and then there you were on the television.
someone else who can do it.
someone else who gets the dreams.
you know, when I get off this phone,
I'm going to have them trace this call.
Oh, I'm counting on it.
and you know, as soon as I get off this call,
I'm going to throw away this cell phone.
well, I mean, you know...
after I pull away from the front of your house.
al, what's going on?
oil.
Oh, my God, he knows where we live.
I can't trace the oil back to its owner.
I will trace and find that cell phone.
if he bought it on credit or left a fingerprint on it, we'll find that, too.
but short of that...
well, what about tonight, what about tomorrow?
I'm concerned about my family.
I'm going to leave a couple uniforms and a cruiser outside to stand watch.
if you're out and about and somebody looks at you funny, somebody makes you feel nervous, call me.
I'll have an officer there before we're off the phone.
my guess is, he's on his way to California by now, or New Mexico.
we've alerted the authorities in those states.
we've set up roadblocks.
but nobody quite knows who we're looking for, so it's hard to say how effective they'll be.
you holding up okay?
it was scary that he was so close.
I'm just amazed that my kids have slept through this.
he sees them in his dreams, huh?
it's too bad we couldn't get the bastard to work for our side.
give me five more minutes.
I'll have my guys out of here and you two can go back to bed.
BRIDGETTE: Psst.
Psst.
the whole house is full of police.
what are you talking about?
I think I liked it all better when Mommy wasn't special.
I think I liked it all better when Mommy was just Mommy.
mommy is just Mommy.
want to hop in here?
Allison: I believe that when people are alone and vulnerable and afraid, they put out a sort of distress signal, an alarm of sorts.
an S. O.S.
it's not visible or audible.
at least not to everyone.
just certain people.
what's going on? You all right?
I'm good.
I'm great.
everything's going to be just fine.
scanlon: Yeah?
Lee, it's Allison.
I know where he is.
woman: And now we get to hear from someone.
I know I'm looking forward to.
her mommy has been in the newspaper and on TV, and this morning I heard.
so let's hear from Bridgette Dubois.
my mom is an investigator for the dis...for the District Attorney.
the District Attorney is a lawyer "who works for the people "when someone is arrested for doing something bad.
the District Attorney is supposed to prove they did it.
my mom helps with this.
you ask her how she helps, she'll tell you she doesn't really know.
I just know that when she's done, she comes home and gets to be with me and my sisters and my dad.
she's a really good investigator, but she's a really great mom.
and I keep thinking, if people would just stop doing bad things, maybe she could stay home and be a mom all the time.
morning, Mom. Did you sleep good?
actually, I did. How about you?
Yeah. Really good.
I even had a good dream.
a good dream? Really?
Uh-huh. It helped me figure out something that was bothering me.
I had one of those, too. What was yours about?
it's almost 2: 00.
you fellows want to round up the groom?
bachelor number one, you're up!
Hey, don juan!
your new ball-and-chain is waiting.
what do you say?
come on, man.
time to flush and go.
your future ex is waiting.
you find him?
I think he's wringing it out.
come on, man. What's the deal?
you fall in?
you okay?
knock it down.
I'm coming in, man.
Oh, man.
what are you doing?
talk to me.
no. It's nothing.
nonsense.
nonsense.
rise and shine.
up and at 'em.
morning.
school. Yay.
no fair, sweet pea.
I just called in your room for you to wake up.
how long have you been out here?
I don't know.
I couldn't sleep.
I have to do this oral presentation on the history of anti-discrimination legislation and I know I'm not going to do very well.
you don't know that.
Oh, yes, I do.
there are kids in my class that have been working on theirs for weeks.
weeks, Ariel?
doesn't actually require weeks.
it's just, some kids are nuts.
besides that it's just some kind of contest.
the top three kids in our school get to go to the state assembly and make their presentations in front of our assemblyman.
Wow.
mom, you don't get it.
I don't care.
but a lot of the other kids do.
and that's just going to make me look worse.
I'm sure you're going to do fine.
that's Mr. Cathcart's class, right?
you always do well in there.
he likes you.
good morning.
or am I being hasty?
we believe they were mules.
impoverished foreign nationals hired by drug dealers to swallow condoms filled with heroin, then fly over to this country on commercial jetliners and wait in hotel rooms to expel the drugs.
what happened to their eyes?
gouged out.
someone's trying to send a message.
I don't follow.
drugs are a cyclical business.
one group will control the trafficking for a while, then somebody else will decide it's their turn.
I'm betting whoever that somebody is that he grabbed these mules at the airport before their real employer could get to them. Took them to that hotel.
sliced 'em in half, rather than wait for nature to deliver the merchandise, then ripped out their eyes just for good measure.
detective Scanlon has quite a bit of experience in these matters.
three years ago he headed up an undercover unit that helped stem a great deal of drug trafficking here in the southwest.
well, good. Then maybe he can tell me how much more of this we can expect.
it's not like the weather.
no one can tell you when it's going to blow over.
I think what our new deputy mayor is asking...
I know what she's asking. She wants to know how messy it's going to get:
if we keep it downtown where nobody really sees it, where nobody really cares, or if it's gonna rear its ugly head in the nice neighborhoods where people actually go to the polls and sometimes even make campaign contributions we'll do our best.
Hi.
Hiya.
so how goes the new job?
well, it would go a lot better if people would stop killing people.
Hey, deputy doll, how's the coffee?
could you not?
hmm? Could I not "what"?
it's important to be specific about these things.
there's all kinds of laws about how to deal with the opposite sex in the workplace and I don't want to run afoul of any of them.
you can see the future. What are my chances?
you're not serious.
what? You don't think I was charming?
it really doesn't matter what I think.
you're wrong.
she's in the elevator right now call her best friend trying to figure out what to wear when I finally ask her out.
what? That's not what you see?
you want to know what I see?
actually. I had a dream about you last night.
a really crazy dream.
I have that effect on women.
I was not in it.
a nightmare. I understand.
you were getting married.
Really? That is a nightmare.
you were so upset with going through with it that you hid in the bathroom and did drugs.
okay, get to the crazy part.
that is crazy. It is.
do I look like a guy who's ever contemplated marriage?
do I look like a guy who's ever done drugs?
okay, I'm going back to the station house.
wait for a call from the deputy mayor.
and so we have all of these anti-discrimination laws that make America a better place to live.
very nice, Ariel.
do you see all those cards?
the history of discrimination in the US and the progression of legislative remedies created by the various branches of government assigned the task of safeguarding the rights of each and every citizen provides a moving portrait of contemporary democracy in action.
in the next 15 minutes, I will attempt to demonstrate how the constant evolution of anti-discrimination laws in the United States has helped to change the way we live as Americans 1, 095 days without drugs.
everyone in this room knows what a monumental event that is.
it's quite a milestone for this man.
and I couldn't be more proud.
here's a little something for you to add to your charm bracelet.
my name's Lee. I'm a drug addict.
Hi, Lee.
is everything okay?
Yeah. I don't know.
I guess...
I guess I had a nightmare.
Wow. I don't think I've ever heard you use that word before.
detective Scanlon was in it.
his eyes were gouged out.
like those women in the newspaper?
what you doing?
hmm?
I don't know.
I think maybe I should give him a call.
and tell him what?
about some nightmare?
it's 2: 00 in the morning.
no. You're right.
what was I thinking?
it'll hold till morning.
it'll definitely hold till morning.
don't do that.
save that stuff for people you like.
good morning to you, too.
I know you want me to think it's some giant coincidence you showed up at the meeting last night but I don't believe in coincidences.
no. You're wrong.
look, I heard you were going to be three years clean.
I'm two and a half.
can't a friend root for a friend?
okay, fine.
I need a favor.
I already did you one.
feel free to leave anytime you want.
Oh, you're cold.
you got a heart of ice.
you froze it, honey.
well, get over it.
people get engaged every day.
sometimes it doesn't work out.
you set me up.
you knew who I was. You knew what I did for a living.
and you knew who I was.
nice girl from a nice family.
Yeah, that's some family.
I would have told you.
when? Before or after the wedding?
hmm?
before or after I was called to testify against them?
what's the favor?
those were our mules somebody sliced and diced the other day.
do you know anything?
you honestly think, if I knew something, I'd tell you?
it would be good for both of us, Lee.
get out of here.
get your clothes, and get out of here.
no, no, sweetie.
no. Those are the cards from Ariel's report.
it's okay. I told her she could have them.
daddy!
is that for me? Thank you.
no. This one. This one.
Oh, that one. Okay.
I don't understand. Last night, you said the presentation went well.
it did. But it's not like it was so good that they're going to send me to the state assembly
mama!
thank you very much.
honey, if you do win, you're going to have to write these all over again.
I'm not going to win.
Terrence Bock is going to win.
his presentation was way longer than anybody else's, and he practically had it memorized.
well, I'm sure he did a good job, but we still don't know.
Oh, yes, I do.
Terrence Bock is going to win.
you looking for me?
Yeah. Lee, come on in.
what's up?
you making any progress identifying those three mules that died the other night?
surprise, surprise.
their fingerprints and DNA don't match anything we had on file.
we reached out to the appropriate foreign governments and they contacted their law enforcement agencies, but it's going to be a while before anyone gets back to us.
what?
I got the damnedest call from a friend in the coroner's office.
their official report won't be out for another couple of hours, but one of these murdered girls doesn't quite fit the profile of your typical drug mule.
how's that?
when was the last time you ran into a dirtpoor girl from Latin America with a nose job?
excuse me?
one of these mules appears to have had cosmetic surgery.
a rhinoplasty.
and, in the coroner's estimation, quite an expensive one.
in addition, she's sporting a very high-end set of dental laminates.
not the kind of thing one would expect from somebody so impoverished that they're willing to swallow capsules of heroin for money.
I'm worried about you.
Hello, stranger.
I had another dream about you.
maybe I'm the one who should be worried about you.
it was kind of nutty. You were with this really exotic woman.
nothing nutty about that.
and she gouged your eyes out with her thumbs, like those mules.
come on. I'm waiting for you to say something funny back.
I don't quite to say something funny back. I'm at a loss for words.
truth is, I make all my exotic women friends wear boxing gloves.
Ah, ha, ha!
Hey, I appreciate the tip.
Oh, hey, did deputy doll ever get back to you?
Wow. First, you gouge out my eyes, then you rip out my heart.
overall, I was very impressed with everyone's presentations.
obviously, everyone can't go to the state assembly but, ultimately, that's not what this assignment was about.
ultimately,
I hope it gave all of you a chance to learn about how the citizens of this country compelled their government to create laws that would protect and guarantee equality and fairness for everyone no matter who they are, no matter what they look like, no matter how much money they make.
this is great.
we're really proud of you, kiddo.
I don't know.
what is there not to know, huh?
you obviously did a great job.
but I didn't.
I mean, you saw.
I did it the night before and the morning of.
well, sometimes...
I can't believe I'm saying this.
sometimes it isn't about that.
I could use a little help over here.
I think what your mother's trying to say is that preparation always counts.
but, a lot of times, in the real world, it ends up being about the final product.
and I guess we have to assume that your final product.
your presentation- was the best.
but it wasn't.
Terrence's was.
well, that's your opinion, honey.
but, apparently, Mr. Cathcart doesn't agree.
wait a second.
who is this "Terrence"?
is he some boy you like?
dad!
I'm just asking.
no. No one likes him.
he's not the kind of boy girls like.
he's kind of icky.
but his presentation was so good.
he's like somebody you'd see on one of those boring cable shows or something talking about history.
I just keep thinking that Mr. Cathcart made a mistake.
well, then, you need to talk to him about it.
either he will convince you that you did a great job or you'll convince him otherwise.
Hey. Thanks for coming.
it's cold out, Lee, and it's late.
you kicked me out of your bed this morning, and then you call me and tell me to come over.
what's going on?
nothing's going on.
you asked me if I could find out who might have done this thing.
you know?
I'm working on it.
I got to ask you a question though.
do you know these girls?
you know their names?
their names?
they're mules. I don't know their names.
they're recruited over there.
I mean, whoever did this, they took their passports.
they took their ticket stubs.
we went through that hotel with a fine-tooth comb, and we couldn't find a thing.
wait a second.
do you know something, or are you trying to find something out?
I know this.
I know it's too early to be waging a war against whoever you think it is might be responsible.
you're confusing me. What are you saying?
I'm saying something's starting to smell funny.
something caught the coroner's eye this morning.
I didn't think much of it at first.
maybe it's something. Maybe it's nothing.
what are you talking about?
I'm not entirely sure.
all I know is something isn't adding up, and I'd hate to see a lot of innocent people die and a lot of blood get spilled for no reason.
talk to who you need to talk to.
buy me some time. Let me get to the bottom of this.
what?
you know, we could have had this conversation in bed.
someone I work with told me to be careful with women like you or I might just end up like one of your mules.
they should mind their own business.
I'll talk to whoever I need to talk to.
I'll try to calm things down.
I appreciate it.
last chance.
don't tempt me.
Oh, baby, that's what I'm here for.
Mr. Cathcart?
Ariel. Come on in.
what can I help you with?
it's about the presentation, the trip.
Oh, you know what? I don't actually have the packet yet.
uh, the permission slips and the information for your parents.
I'm still waiting for it to come from the central office.
uh, no. That- that's not it.
um, I was really surprised that you picked me.
come sit down.
why are you surprised that I would pick you?
well, I guess I just didn't think I was the best.
what, you think someone else's was better?
Terrence Bock? You're kidding.
that boy disgusts me.
Terrence Bock is a very bright boy.
uh, his research was very detailed.
I just look at him, and I get depressed.
you know he's going to spend his life alone.
but a presentation is more than just the collection of data.
you know, its effectiveness often hinges on a lot of intangibles.
but does he ever wash?
have you ever seen him when there wasn't something in his nose?
likability, the attractiveness of the person making the presentation.
your willingness to listen to what they have to say.
he's repugnant.
even the word "repugnant" finds him repugnant.
in all those areas, Ariel, your work was vastly superior.
uh, okay.
I hope I answered your question.
and I hope you're genuinely as excited about this as I am.
I think we're going to have a wonderful day at the capitol.
uh, sure, Mr. Cathcart.
Hey, you got a minute?
what's that expression?
fool me once, good for you.
fool me twice...
Hey, what's on your mind?
I don't understand. You should be a happy guy.
two days ago we all thought we were staring at a drug war.
48 hours have gone by and nothing's happened.
I know. That's kind of interesting, isn't it?
well, I'm just assuming.
I mean, you told me yesterday you were going to talk to some people try and cool things off.
you're right it was me. I'm a hero.
I made peace in the middle east.
I should run for president.
you know what? I have dinner waiting for me at home, so if you're not going to tell me what's on your mind...
I spent most of the afternoon with the coroner.
that third mule.
it's not just a nose job, not just nice teeth.
she had piercings in places I didn't know you could pierce.
not something you see a lot of in Latin America.
didn't I have this very conversation with you yesterday?
so what are you thinking?
an American girl in a foreign country down on her luck agrees to swallow drugs for the money to get back home?
maybe. Maybe she never left home.
excuse me?
pubic hair's blonde.
didn't have any when they brought her in.
you know how nails and hair keep growing for a couple days after.
I got a hunch her eyes were blue, but I guess we'll never know that.
tell me where you're going with this.
somebody dies by accident, on purpose...I don't know.
they need to get rid of a body.
as luck would have it, their family happens to be in the drug-running business.
so you slaughter two of your own mules, girls that no one will ever miss, you throw in a third everybody assumes that they come from the same place, do the same thing.
and while everybody's looking for a girl from Latin America, jane doe from somewhere in the US lies unclaimed in the coroner's office.
something like that.
mom?
can you come talk to me?
that Mr. Cathcart, the one who said those horrible things about Terrence.
I'm pretty sure he wasn't even in the room today.
you know what I'm talking about, don't you?
I don't know. Maybe. Kinda.
I think it might have been his heart that you heard.
I think it might have been his soul.
okay, but what do I do now?
I don't know.
what do you want to do?
shouldn't we tell someone?
tell them what?
that deep down inside Mr. Cathcart doesn't like Terrence?
how would we prove that?
what would we say?
so we just do nothing?
I didn't say that.
does Terence know how much you liked his presentation?
no.
I don't talk to Terrence.
nobody I know talks to Terrence.
what?
I was listening to your heart.
I was listening to your soul.
Hey, Lee.
I know it's the middle of the night, but...
what's this?
search warrant.
you're kidding, right?
searching for what?
why don't you just let us in, Lee?
appreciate it.
they'll just take a quick look around, then we'll be on our way.
Mr. District attorney?
excuse me.
found these on the night table, sir.
morning.
Hey, early bird.
what's up?
I'm concerned about detective Scanlon.
the last three nights I've had dreams about him.
dreams, huh?
well, let me be the first to let you down easy.
office gossip is he's got a yen for our new deputy mayor.
I'm serious.
come on, man.
time to flush and go. Your future ex is waiting.
lieutenant Greene.
Mr. District attorney, may I speak to you for a moment?
in private, if that's possible.
sorry to interrupt.
no problem.
is everything all right?
that, that was lieutenant Greene.
he runs vice.
he came to tell me they finally identify that third mule.
turns out she wasn't a mule at all.
she was a police officer- an undercover police officer.
nice girl.
third-generation phoenix police.
I don't understand.
someone dyed her hair black, pulled out her eyes, threw her in a trash can with two other mules, and...
they figured that we'd be so busy looking for someone Colombian or Honduran or...
we didn't even know she was missing.
I'm sorry. What were we talking about? Dreams...
I'm going to come back another time.
did you know her well?
not really.
she worked for Larry in vice.
Larry and I came up together, undercover work.
no, I didn't know her.
I knew the person who did this to her, though.
four years ago or so,
I was deep undercover investigating the Cabrerra family drug operation.
I was spending a lot of time in clubs.
spending a lot of time with a lot of really twisted people, dabbling in the drugs myself, which was really stupid, but kind of the only way to live in that world.
she was this club girl. Everywhere I was, she was.
she was so much fun.
and I'm this pathological bachelor, but all of a sudden,
I can't bear the thought of living my life without this girl.
I can't bear the thought of her being with anybody else.
I fell hard, Allison.
then one day, our favorite district attorney Manuel Devalos calls me into his office.
he says, "You engaged to this woman?"
and it's her.
she's a Cabrerra.
it's all a setup.
I can't testify against them without an attorney saying, "Hey, wait a second. You're not an unbiased witness."
so they drummed me out of vice, put me through rehab, moved me over to homicide.
I never saw her again.
not until the other day when she showed up at that meeting.
so...
that's the wedding, the drugs.
what else did you dream?
she blinds you.
I guess we both know what that's about.
Larry said this girl Jennifer was deep undercover in Elena's organization.
we're guessing Elena killed her, then sought me out to be sure we bought the mule thing.
and we would have if it wasn't for the plastic surgery.
what happens now?
we have a warrant out for her arrest, but I'm guessing she's gone.
what was that other dream?
Devalos searches your place.
right.
can't help you with that one.
Hi, mom.
I'm hungry. Can we stop somewhere for food?
we have food at home, Bridge. We got apples, oranges, bananas.
that's not food. It's fruit.
Hi, mom. Can I bring a friend home from school?
now? Today?
Oh, Ariel, who is it?
sure, I guess so.
Hey, Terrence, she said it's all right!
Hi, Terrence. Nice to meet you.
Hi.
are you hot with that coat on?
no.
this is my sister Bridgette.
Hi.
tell her you want to stop for food.
thanks for being so nice to him.
letting him stay for dinner and everything.
Oh, I was happy to.
he seemed really...
what is the deal with that coat?
I don't know.
he's kind of odd.
I'm not even sure we're going to stay friends.
although, he did seem to hit it off with Bridgette.
but you were right.
I'm glad I told him how much I liked his presentation.
you can tell he's probably not somebody who hears good stuff very much.
I think you probably made him very happy.
I talked to Mr. Cathcart, too.
Oh, yeah?
I told him I wouldn't be going to the state assembly.
I hope that's okay.
I think that's very okay.
how did he react?
he got really quiet.
both of him.
we have really special kids.
I had nothing to do with it. I wasn't even in town that week.
did you ask what gives with that boy and his coat?
apparently, that's where he derives his extraordinary powers of elocution from.
today started off as the most dark, awful day.
what happened to change it?
nothing changed.
the woman responsible for all this death and sadness is still at large.
detective Scanlon is out there somewhere wrestling with his demons, trying to make sense of the choices he's made with his life.
a young undercover cop and two unsuspecting mules are still dead.
nothing changed.
it's just...
I have kids.
no matter how dark things get at work I can come home.
and there's always something light.
all right, maybe I was home those weeks.
forget the light.
close the door.
you already killed one cop.
you shoot me, they won't even bother with a trial.
they'll just claim you tried to escape one night and let one of the guards take you out for fun.
I didn't kill any cops.
I didn't kill any mules.
I didn't do this.
it wasn't done by me.
it was done to me.
don't answer it.
yeah?
it's Manny Devalos.
Hey, what's going on? Is everything okay?
I don't know. I think I have to call Devalos.
what?
what are you talking about?
it's 3: 00 in the morning, al.
almost out the door.
excuse me?
I'm sorry. Who is this?
it's Allison Dubois. It's Allison.
I'm sorry to call you in the middle of the night. It's just...
Allison, I can't talk now.
look, someone spotted a woman who matches the description of Elena Cabrerra breaking and entering an apartment in the building where detective Scanlon lives.
we've been calling and calling, but we can't get him on the phone.
it's probably a wild-goose chase, but I'm headed over there now with lieutenant Greene.
can I talk to you tomorrow please?
of course, but...
it's not a wild-goose chase, sir.
it's not a wild-goose chase.
forget the light. Close the door.
you already killed one cop.
you shoot me, they won't even bother with a trial.
they'll just claim you tried to escape one night and let one of the guards take you out for fun.
I didn't kill any cops.
I didn't kill any mules.
I didn't do this.
it wasn't done by me.
it was done to me.
I need your help.
I need your protection.
what are you talking about?
of all the women in the world, you're the one I know needs the least protection.
now put the gun down.
you're such an adorable fool, Lee.
everybody needs protection.
especially drug dealers.
don't you know that's what you were supposed to be?
when I first met you at the clubs, when I first made you for a cop,
I said to my uncles, "that one. He's cute. He's on his way up. Let me at him."
and you were good at everything.
except the compromising- your-convictions part.
no way were you going to take a piece of our operation in return for a little protection.
it just wasn't in you.
sorry to let you down.
I had a need and you couldn't fill it.
but your friend, Larry Greene... What'd you call him?
the best man I know?
very practical fellow.
happy to hear that.
now here you want my help.
then put the gun down...
and let me take you in.
anything you want to say, I know the Da would love to hear it.
I'm trying to tell you what's going on.
I'm trying to tell you what happened.
that girl? That cop?
she was deep undercover, and she figured it out.
she figured out lieutenant Greene was dirty, so he killed her.
made her look like a mule, and figured I'd start a war over it, and by the time the smoke cleared, nobody'd be the wiser.
now, that's quite a story, Elena.
but you have to admit you been telling stories since the day I met you.
I'm just a businesswoman who loves to dance, Lee.
I've been waiting for you my whole life, Lee.
I'd love to marry you, Lee.
now put the gun down, let me take you to city hall where you can tell your story to somebody who actually gives a damn.
thank you.
turn around.
yeah?
Hey, Lee, it's Greene.
word on the street is you might have some company.
got it under control. We're heading downtown, you want to meet us.
whatever you say, amigo.
just want to warn you, though...
the whole damn cavalry is on the way.
do me a favor and tell them to meet me back at the fort.
you got it.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
you have the right to counsel.
Skank-whore death merchant. Kills a cop. Breaks and enters.
over and out.
"that one," I said.
he's cute. Let me at him.
how you doing?
I was concerned about you.
why, did you have any more dreams?
well, yeah, actually, I had one.
a woman came to me.
she was on her way to a very dark, awful place, and she knew it.
before she got there, she wanted me to say "hi" to you.
to tell you she was sorry.
to tell you "thank you."
what, no "deputy doll"?
I don't know.
I got the sense it wasn't appreciated.
Really?
not much of a mind reader, are you?
if you'll excuse me, I got some... work to do.
woman: Hello?
Hello?
woman: Hello?
Hello?
woman: Hello?
mom, next time can I pour the milk?
no, he's not.
aren't you going to have any breakfast?
this is breakfast.
I got out of there ten of 2: 00, and what is it now-- it's 7: 20.
I've got to be back there in 45 minutes.
it's been over a week now like this.
no wonder you're so tired.
they got guys working on this project in their late 20s.
they're out of there, like, 7: 00, 8: 00 at night.
I'm barely 40, and I feel like an antique.
well, that's crazy.
you've been there nine years.
you have more experience than anyone else.
Yeah, I cost them more than anyone else, too.
I just... I can't shake the feeling that this project is some kind of a bake-off.
that when it's all done, the winner is going to get a pat on the back, the loser's going to get shown out the door.
what do you mean loser?
it's a project, not a contest.
how do you know?
I don't know.
well, okay then. I work there. I do.
I feel like I never see you.
that's because you never do see me.
I don't get a kiss?
huh?
nothing.
I'll see you tonight, or whenever.
sir? Yep.
I have those parole applications you asked me to take a look at.
great. Anything in there jump out at you?
not really.
just a collection of horrible human beings looking for a little mercy despite the fact that they had none for their victims.
Yeah, today is the day.
parole board hearings. Yahoo.
nothing like spending time in a concrete bunker listening to a bunch of vermin swear that they've seen the light, found the way, and if only you'll let them out into society
care to come with?
is there a problem?
Oh, no. I just have to pick up my girls from school.
Joe's been working crazy hours on this project.
that shouldn't be a problem.
this will only take a couple hours.
so how does this work?
it's pretty cut and dried.
the prisoner is announced by the parole board.
he's given an opportunity to make his statement，
express remorse for his crimes.
once the board has her/his request, they'll ask if we have any objections.
man: Tell us about the crime you committed, Mr. Cosgrove.
I shot my wife.
you killed her.
what the board needs to determine at this time is do you regret that you committed this crime?
I do, sir.
I regret it every day of my life.
I'm a very different man from the one who arrived here ten years ago.
I work hard to be a better person.
I gave my life over to the Lord.
would the State care to comment?
due to the heinous nature of this crime, as well as to the fact that, to my recollection, this prisoner has never shown any remorse before this hearing, the State would ask that parole be denied at this time.
man: The board is inclined to agree.
parole is denied.
don't worry, just one more to go.
the board will now consider the petition of Mr. Sam Elkin.
you've served five years of a life sentence, and this is the first time you've been eligible to appear before the parole board, correct?
Yes, sir.
that's correct, sir.
tell us about your crime, Mr. Elkin.
Mr. Elkin?
you know what I did.
it's important that we hear it from you.
I guess I kidnapped my girlfriend...
my ex-girlfriend.
we broke up about a month before...
she broke up-- it was her idea.
I waited for her in her car.
I had a key.
she used to let me use it.
anyway, I waited for her.
I knew she'd be going out.
it was Tuesday. She always went out on Tuesdays.
I forced her to drive out into the desert.
and once we were there, we... we did it.
I... I made her do it.
when we were done, I just, uh, started choking her.
she was tiny.
it didn't take long.
it was almost morning by then, so I drove her car back into the city with her dead body in the passenger seat.
pulled into a busy car wash on Bell Road.
the kind with two lanes
one where they clean the inside, and an express where the car just goes through unattended and they clean the outside.
once the car was inside the wash,
I, uh, just turned and walked away.
that's what you needed to hear, right?
man: It's my understanding that until you became eligible for parole this month, you repeatedly denied committing any of these crimes.
uh, yes, sir.
and I regret that, sir.
Mr. District Attorney?
while I am moved to finally hear Mr. Elkin admit to these heinous acts,
I can't help but be suspicious of his motives.
Mr. Elkin is, after all, well aware that taking responsibility for his crimes is a condition of his parole eligibility.
perhaps his apology and remorse will carry more weight when he has another five years to sleep on them.
Hello?
I'm lonely.
Hi, lonely.
my name's Joe.
so what do you think?
what are the chances I'll see you before today becomes tomorrow?
uh, you wouldn't happen to know what the temperature in hell is, would you?
you haven't heard anything about a big freeze, maybe?
they didn't mention it on the news, no.
Mm. Then I'm probably going to be here for a while.
talk to me.
tell me about your day.
I sat in on a parole hearing today.
heard this guy confess that he killed his girlfriend.
I got this strong feeling that he didn't do it.
And?
and I just had a dream about him kissing this woman.
the dead girlfriend?
someone else.
you know what I think?
I think you've got kissing on the brain.
no one's kissed me on the brain, or anywhere else for that matter, for quite some time.
I think break time is over.
love you, too.
love you, three.
whatever you want, you're going to have to do it yourself.
not funny.
when did you get in?
I don't know.
I couldn't bear to look at the clock.
I really have to get some sleep.
I just found out the client's coming in tomorrow at 3: 00 for an update.
Oh, crap.
what?
did we ever get my suit pants fixed after the cuff came unraveled at Christmas?
"we"? If by "we," you really mean "me," then no.
we didn't know about your cuff.
okay, forget it.
I'll wear shorts and a T-shirt.
I can go straight from the meeting to unemployment and then directly to the car wash to look for a job.
hey... there is a tailor who works at the mall by City Hall who does alterations while you wait.
I can drop them off first thing and pick them up at lunch.
Wow.
on second thought, bring those brains of yours over here.
I think I do feel like kissing them.
woman: No, I just felt him there, and he was standing over my bed, just looming there.
and then he leaned down...
and then he kissed me.
you'd better not be playing solitaire on that computer.
it's almost 2: 00. You're cutting it close.
you're welcome.
I'm sorry. There was a thank you in there.
you just didn't hear it.
well, you're right.
I'm running late.
Ah! Ah!
the strangest thing happened to me on the way over here.
I saw this woman.
she looked just like that girl I've been seeing in my dreams.
the one who keeps getting kissed?
she was going up an escalator.
I was going down.
geez.
there's no reason some stranger in a mall should be getting all the action.
I'm sorry I haven't been around.
thank you for lunch.
you tip all the delivery people that way, or was that special for me?
Mm... Yeah?
forgive me, Mr. Dubois.
I just wanted to remind you we're going to be leaving in approximately 30 minutes.
I'm all over it, Edrick.
I'm just going to grab a bite to eat, and then I'm going to change.
Edrick, this is my wife, Allison.
Allison, this is Edrick, who is single-handedly making it tough for mere mortals like me to have to work anything less than a 24-hour day.
I need your help...
uh...
first generation American.
couldn't decide between Ed and Rick.
nice meeting you, Mrs. Dubois.
minutes.
I'm counting the seconds.
the Elkin case? Sam Elkin?
why would you want to revisit the Elkin case?
it's five years old. The case is closed.
the accused man confessed.
call me old-fashioned, but if you want to revisit old cases,
I'd certainly prefer that you find one that's unsolved and where the guilty party isn't already behind bars.
I told you yesterday I felt strongly.
I'm starting to regret asking you to come with Elkin's lying.
and I told you yesterday I completely agree.
he was lying...
about feeling badly, about being filled with remorse, about his supposed concern for Amanda·Crane's friends and family.
I have court.
Mr. District Attorney...
Allison, look at the coroner's report.
I did.
then you know that Elkin's sperm was still inside the victim when we recovered her body.
there's got to be something more than just your sense that this man wasn't being truthful.
I've been having this dream...
Uh-huh.
this woman-- not the victim.
she's lying in bed in the dark.
her lover comes up and steals a kiss.
sounds romantic.
up until last night, the man had no face.
now I see it's Sam Elkin.
I'm not sure I know what that means.
I'm not sure I know what it means, either, but I actually saw this woman today, a block away from here at the mall.
seems to me there must be some reason.
I'm dreaming these dreams, some reason I met Elkin yesterday, some reason I crossed paths with this woman today.
go talk to Scanlon.
if the two of you can find something in the file worth looking at...
thank you.
excuse me, uh, I'm looking for Detective Lee Scanlon.
that's his desk over there.
must have stepped out for a second.
excuse me.
uh, you look a bit upset.
my name's, uh, Allison Dubois.
I work with the District Attorney's Office.
I was wondering if I can be of some kind of help to you.
I don't know.
I've been waiting to see a detective since early this morning.
I came here with a friend.
we waited for an hour and a half, then they told us to go away for an hour.
so we took a walk around the mall, came back.
then they said it would be another two to three hours.
my friend finally had to leave.
I'm missing a day's work.
you know what?
I work with one of the detectives here.
let me see if I can't get him to talk to you.
Oh, thanks. That would be great.
thank you.
I'm sorry, Miss...?
Walsh.
I'm not married.
Mrs. Dubois explained you've been waiting a long while.
what can we help you with?
well, I should tell you, I called the police yesterday morning.
they came by my house, but...
start from the beginning. Tell us what happened.
six months ago, I moved to Phoenix.
just before the start of the school year.
I teach music.
anyway, I found this wonderful apartment for very little money.
but shortly after I settled in,
I began to hear noises... only at night.
they'd start just as I was getting ready for bed.
do you have any pets?
a cat-- Boots.
but I've had him, like, forever.
he doesn't make these sounds.
okay, so you heard there sounds...
Yeah. I would call out, but no one would answer.
uh, this would happen...
like, three, maybe four times a week.
so what'd you do?
I didn't think that there was anything to do.
I wasn't certain that there was anything really there...
so frankly, for a long time, I did nothing.
but then the noises started to change.
what do you mean? Change how?
well, there was this clicking sound.
clicking?
um...
a camera.
huh?
I was wondering if you thought it sounded like a camera.
um... I don't know.
okay. Whatever it was, there's this new sound.
and I ignored that for a while, too.
but then two nights ago...
I felt him there...
close.
he was standing over the bed.
forgive me for asking, but how do you know that?
how do you know he was there?
stand up.
excuse me?
would you stand up, please?
close your eyes.
any questions?
no.
and then?
he kissed me.
hmm.
so what'd you do?
I screamed.
and then he was gone.
and then I called the police, and then the police came over.
and then.
I have no way of proving this...
but I think they laughed at me.
whoa, hold it, you're...
I want to make sure I've got this right.
you're not alleging that this guy raped you, struck you, fondled you?
a man broke into my apartment...
and he kissed me.
miss Walsh...
you're going to tell me to change the locks, move in with a friend...
buy a big dog?
can I see you, Allison, uh...
in private for one second?
what am I doing to you?
shouldn't the question be what are you gonna do for that woman?
uh, no. I don't think so.
what is your problem?
she's clearly being victimized.
she came to you for help.
victimized?
a man keeps breaking into her apartment. Maybe.
no. Not maybe.
based on what she's telling me, the police who went into her apartment couldn't find any evidence of a break in.
and obviously, there's no witnesses.
she is a witness.
I don't think so. To what?
to the breaking and entering.
well it doesn't actually appear as though there was any breaking.
which would lead me to suspect that there probably wasn't any real entering, either.
so what do you want me to do?
protect her. From what?
this dangerous band of marauders and thieves who may have broken into her place and stolen, what, a kiss?
what are you so hot about?
you don't even know this lady?
didn't you just tell me you met her ten minutes ago?
I know what she's telling us is true-- I saw it.
Oh, you were there?
and I saw something else, too.
he was the person doing the kissing.
you're not making much sense, if the guy's still in prison.
I know, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me either.
what do you want me to do, Allison?
ms. Walsh...
you ever heard of a man named Sam Elkin?
no. Doesn't ring a bell. Why?
uh, never mind. No big deal.
I've conferred with Mrs. Dubois here and we've decided to post a visible police presence right outside your building.
they'll be there 24 hours a day, and if anyone comes in or out, they'll see it.
additionally, we'll set up a direct phone link to your apartment.
if anyone does come in, you just pick up that phone and we're there.
Wow. That's great.
I was just hoping that maybe you could send someone over to take a second look.
Really?
I wouldn't hear of it.
this kissing thing, that's not something I want to play around with.
well, thank you.
and thank you, Mrs. Dubois.
Oh, no, it's nothing. That's what we're here for.
???
Hello?
Hello?
are you here?
are you watching me?
Hey.
you're home, and it's not even 12: 00.
will wonders never cease?
you'd almost think that I lived here.
Mm...
I missed you.
I hate waking up and having dreams and not having you to share them with.
well, good.
because I suspect that pretty soon, not only will I be around during the middle of the night, but quite possibly during the day, as well.
what are you talking about?
well, we went to see the client today, and it's like I was invisible.
nobody really wanted to hear from me.
it was The Edrick Show.
all day, all the time.
you know, the guy's been an engineer for 15 minutes, but it's like he's Galileo the way they hang on his every word.
Oh.
honey...
and not just...
not just the client, but the senior guys from our firm, as well.
I know that look.
I used to get that look.
that's the "you're the future of this company" look.
hmm, I think you're exaggerating.
I met Edrick.
he bows at your feet.
he worships you.
he's got me lined up in his crosshairs.
he covets my parking space.
he lusts after the Senior Vice President nameplate on my office door.
he pines for my four extra vacation days a year.
Mm.
and you know what the surprising part is?
I don't think I really give a damn.
it's good to be home.
and you?
any more kissing dreams?
mm, the kissing has stopped.
there is no kissing.
no real clarity, either.
hmm.
interview Elkin again?
whatever for?
I've been having these dreams.
all of them are very similar.
up until last night,
I thought they were about this blind woman,
kathleen Walsh, being kissed by a man who has no features, being kissed by Sam Elkin.
but then last night,
I had the same dream, set in the same place, but Kathleen is gone.
Elkin's dead girlfriend, Amanda Crane, is in her place.
and this suggests?
I don't know, but I'd like to try and find out.
I don't have it, and I couldn't do it.
I left here at 10: 30 last night.
no matter how much I try,
I can't design with my eyes closed.
the drawings, the silicone diode.
I don't have them, I'm still working on them.
sorry, kid.
I need your help.
excuse me?
all my work.
I sent it down to QC, double-check the specs.
none of it checked out.
the quality control guys called it gibberish.
it's only a matter of time before everyone upstairs hears about it.
I need your help, Mr. Dubois.
so what'd I do?
well, that's what I was hoping to figure out.
I don't know if you remember me.
my name's Allison Dubois.
I work with The District Attorney's Office.
I was here for your parole hearing the other day.
sat right over there.
you waiting for a thank you?
it's gonna be a long wait.
well, no, I'm not here for a thank you.
I'd just like to get some questions answered.
well, I don't know.
depends on the questions.
I mean, what's in it for me?
looks like I'm gonna be in here the rest of my life.
I'm not what you'd call highly incentivized.
okay, well, let's start with an easy one then.
why did you sit there the other day and plead forgiveness for a crime that you didn't commit?
I mean, I know your lawyer must have told you your only chance of parole was for you to come in and sit there and tell the board what they wanted to hear, but I'm here to tell you,
I strongly suspect that you did not commit that crime.
now, I'm not on the board, and I'm with The District Attorney's Office, but I'm no attorney, so I can't really promise you anything.
but if you have a story to tell,
I would like to hear it.
and if I believe you,
I will do everything I can to be sure that everyone listens.
I loved Amanda Crane.
she was a college girl,
I was a guy who fixed cars.
her friends didn't think much of me.
her family didn't think much of me.
but I loved her.
we went together for months.
used to spend almost every day together.
every day except Tuesdays.
at first, she was always coming up with excuses.
I have a test, I have a paper due.
then she switched her story on me.
said she had a job, she had to work.
didn't really bother me at first.
didn't think much of it.
then I lost my wallet one night, had no money to get home.
I went over to her dorm, she wasn't there.
it was 3: 00 in the morning.
next day she tells me she was working all night.
"doing what?" I said.
that's when things started to get strange.
for a while, she wouldn't tell me, but I wouldn't let it go.
I was like a dog with a bone.
finally, one night, she tells me.
she met a man.
he offered to pay her way through school.
all she had to do was go over to this apartment he owned.
when she gets inside, she puts on a blindfold, spends the night.
and do what? Exactly.
that's what I wanted to know.
she swears to me, she's not doing anything.
she just puts on a blindfold, takes off her clothes, puts on a nightgown, goes to bed.
got up the next morning, put her clothes back on, took the blindfold off, and walked out the door.
and that was it?
so she said.
I asked her if he was there.
she said she supposed so, but she never heard him, never felt him, never sensed he was there.
I didn't believe her at first.
I used to drop her off a couple of blocks away.
she'd let me use the car.
then one night, I followed her.
she caught me before she got there.
she was furious.
we had a huge fight, broke up.
I'd call her, she wouldn't answer.
I'd go over to her dorm, she wouldn't let me in.
that's when she got the restraining order.
I stayed away for a month, but then I couldn't take it any longer.
I went over to her dorm.
damn near busted the door down.
her roommate threatened to call the cops, but Amanda finally let me in.
roommate took off, and we had another huge fight and then, a huge cry...
and then, we made love.
I told her I was going to find a way to pay for school.
I was going to do it.
she told me she loved me, she missed me.
she was going to quit.
she was going to find a way to tell that guy that night.
that was the last time I saw her.
next thing I know, they found her car at that car wash.
my DNA was everywhere.
it was inside the car, inside her.
I told them my story, but no one believed me.
ma'am?
what are you thinking?
I was thinking, have you ever met Kathleen Walsh?
no, I don't think so.
what does she look like?
I'm thinking she looks a lot like this guy's next victim.
I'm not going to even pretend to know what he likes.
scanlon: You think this is the guy who's been sneaking into your friend Kathleen's apartment?
well, she's not my friend, but yes, what I'm saying is I feel very strongly the man who's been watching Kathleen is the same man who was watching Elkin's girlfriend, Amanda, and very well may have been responsible for her death.
you know, when I was preparing for Elkin's parole hearing,
I remember reading his statement.
this crazy story about his girlfriend having a job, only he didn't know where, and he didn't know with whom.
I know, it sounds so bizarre. Bizarre?
no, it aspires to "bizarre.
Allison, this man's sperm was still inside her when they found the body.
Yeah, they made up the night before.
he went by her dorm.
her roommate saw him.
precisely, he was in violation of the restraining order she took out against him.
not exactly the kind of thing you want to put in front of a judge in hopes of reopening a case.
what if we could catch him?
you lost me.
well, we know he likes Kathleen.
so what if we can remove the visible police presence outside the building.
the squad car, the patrolman?
are you suggesting that we use this woman as bait?
we might be able to do it safely.
wire the place up so we could hear everything, hide a bunch of SWAT guys.
we're already providing round- the-clock police protection against an intruder I'm not convinced even exists!
now we're talking about spending more of the taxpayer's money to catch someone you think might have committed a five-year-old murder, for which we already have someone in prison?
doesn't matter-- won't work unless Kathleen Walsh agrees to stay in that apartment without a police car standing watch outside her building.
which I'm guessing might be a tough sell.
well, can't we at least ask her?
it's 11 minutes past 8: 00.
she might not have left for work yet.
it's up to you.
hello.
ms. Walsh, this is District Attorney Devalos.
I'm sorry to bother you so early in the morning, but we think we may have developed a significant lead in your case, and I was wondering if I might be able to persuade you to let us pull the police presence in front of your building for several nights in hopes of drawing the suspect out.
obviously, we would install other safety measures.
last night was the first good night's sleep
I've had in months.
I can't tell you what it was like to get into bed and know I was alone.
know I was alone.
joe: Hey, where you going?
I got to call Scanlon.
Yeah.
he's in the apartment.
I don't know how he got in there, but...
are you talking about Kathleen Walsh's place?
I got a cop and a cop car sitting in front of her building, trust me.
I'm telling you, he can get past them.
we changed the locks on every door, and checked the latches on all her windows.
it doesn't matter.
Allison, what you're saying doesn't make any sense.
please! You have a man right there.
can't you send him up?
it's 2: 00 in the morning, Allison.
all right, I'll send someone up there.
I'll call you right back.
I'm not sure how I feel about you calling strange men at 2: 00 in the morning.
I'm worried, Joe.
that's good enough for me.
you were right about Edrick, by the way.
what do you mean?
did he fall to his knees, beg for mercy?
pretty damn close.
Hey.
two officers went up, Allison.
they checked the whole place.
no one was in there, and no one was getting in there,
I mean, except for one fairly cheesed-off blind lady, who said she was enjoying the best night's sleep she'd had in months.
Really?
but I don't understand.
no offense, Allison, but it's 2: 00 in the morning.
you, me, and Devalos are supposed to meet at 8: 00 a. m.
would it be okay if we chatted then?
sure.
now you're suggesting we use this woman as bait?
well, we know he likes Kathleen, so maybe we could remove some of the visible police presence around the building.
the car sitting there, the patrolman?
okay...
what do you want me to say?
well, I don't know.
last night, I convinced myself that you thought it was a good idea.
well... I don't know what to tell you.
Allison, be realistic.
after you convinced Detective Scanlon to send the police charging into this woman's apartment at 2: 00 in the morning, the other tenants in the building, who are already up in arms about being stopped every time they come in and go out, have had it up to here.
not to mention what it's costing the department keeping personnel there 24h.
I think we have to pull the plug on this thing.
but, sir, that man was there!
I saw him-- we were here having a meeting like this...
I have enormous respect for you, but it's 8: 10, and I'm due in the Judge's Chambers in 20 minutes.
8: 10?
last night, you said it was 8: 11.
last night? What are you talking about?
Hey, I need to use your phone.
hello.
Kathleen, it's Allison.
are you standing in your kitchen wearing your bathrobe holding a cup of hot coffee?
well, no.
now I'm making my way into the living room, wearing my bathrobe, holding a cup of hot coffee.
Kathleen, I need you to stay calm and do exactly as I say.
take that hot coffee you're holding and throw it over your right shoulder.
this is Detective Scanlon.
I need you to get up there now.
enter Kathleen Walsh's apartment, weapons drawn.
Kathleen, do it now-- he's right behind you!
mom, don't be ridiculous.
No!
police! Release that woman, and put your hands in the air!
DEVALOS: I want to thank you for your bravery.
and I would also like to apologize for the initial skepticism that came from this office.
apology accepted.
turns out your tormentor was also your neighbor.
it seems your apartment and his were originally designed as a single unit.
Mr. Christopher Russo and his mother lived there until the early '90s, when his mother passed on, and he decided to turn it into two apartments.
your living room closet shares a common wall with one in his bedroom.
scanlon: He finally confessed to everything last night from his hospital bed.
he hired Amanda Crane five years ago.
when she told him that the arrangement no longer worked for her, he told her he had pictures of her.
she threatened to call the police.
they fought; he strangled her.
he claims to have been so horrified by the act of killing Amanda, that he completely swore off having anything to do with the opposite sex.
started renting the apartment and completely forgot about the common closet.
then, you came along, a beautiful tenant with a built-in blindfold, and his old compulsions just took over.
well, I'm just happy to know he's behind bars.
which reminds me, there is someone who would very much like to meet you.
this is Sam Elkin.
it's very nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, Sam.
I've never slept with an executive senior vice president before.
five extra vacation days a year.
very impressive.
so what did Edrick have to say about it?
he was upset, but I explained to him, with age comes experience, and with experience comes wisdom.
and what comes with wisdom?
with any luck...
there were 5 of us in that room.
only two of us made it out alive.
my name is , I'm mrs. Dubois.
can you a moment? - talk about what?
about millions of dollars.
what is it? - it's you're saying if I don't sign this, I can't come back to work.
his wife's head off and kept her head as souvenir.
we find that the defendent guilty of murder in the first degree.
see this.
body.
already being release lunch.
what is it like ?
I need to talk to you about a dream I just had.
you said there are 5 victims, and you say your friend is victim No. 4.
I thought about you, in a hotel, by yourself.
thousands of hotel rooms boss get fired
I like being the new D. A. Oh Phoenix.
murder, stop the murder, stop the murderer.
found her in the hotel bath tub, previous victim's head it was her head body, we can't allow that happen.
this national reporter has been writing some pretty nasty pieces about me.
talk about some other work you do for us.
where would something like that come from?
is it apparently came from you, allison.
I don't even know a PD. Mccall.
I think maybe you do. - PD.
you're not at all who you say you are, are you?
okay, but then if you were really the psychic you claim to be, wouldn't you have known that?
you cannot run this story.
I told you things inconfidence.
crazy things, allison.
I told you those thingsto save your life!
Hey.
baby, honey.
try not to wake your sister.
daddy and I have to talk to you.
you know how we never really told anyone about mommy's dreams?
about how mommy sees things, knows things sometimes.
well, now that this article's in the paper, people are going to know.
some people, some people...
are going to think that mommy's lying.
and some people might even think that mommy's crazy.
and you two may hear some of that at school and when you're out.
you really think people are going to think that?
some.
so what do we do?
I mean, if someonesays something bad?
well, what I'd like you to try to do is to ignore it.
I mean, we know the truth, right?
excuse me, are you allison dubois?
you just pulled into her parking space.
if you'll just... - is this her?
I think so. - I have to get to work.
can you talk about your relationship as a spiritual advisor to the district attorney?
do you actually talk to dead people?
are there any dead people here now?
could you point them out to us? - I really have to get to work.
the fourth victim's name was pamela franklin.
27 years old.
does she even look like your reporter friend?
she's not my friend.
sorry. Just curious.
no, not even close. - Speaking of which, we have removed all surveillance and protective manpower from ms. Livingston
that is to say ms. Mccall, and her hotel.
I mentioned it to the deputy mayor.
she's going to make sure the press is informed.
gee, if I had known,
I could have mentioned it to the welcoming committee of reporters who greeted me in the parking garage this morning.
I'm sorry, you were briefing us on victim number four.
got an old friend of yours out here.
mind if I bring him in?
fantastic.
I am so glad that you could make this work.
for you, manny, anything.
I'm not going down like my predecessor.
I like being the new D. A. of phoenix.
came straight from the airport.
I'd like you all to meet an old law school buddy of mine, tom van dyke
assistant district attorney out of flagstaff and a good friend.
the governor suggested that I bring in a new face to help, um...
how'd he put it?
dissipate some of the heat we're feeling, and tom was the first man I thought of.
you've already met lynn.
this is detective lee scanlon.
detective. - Pleasure.
and over here is allison dubois from my office.
I think I read about you on the plane.
well, don't believe everything you read.
actually, your timing is perfect.
lee was just briefing us on the tragic killing last night
a young woman named pamela franklin.
27, physical therapist.
where was she from?
that's one of the things that's throwing us for a bit of a loop.
she isn't from anywhere, she's local.
lived here all her life.
local? I don't get it.
then why was she staying in a hotel?
we're still trying to figure that out.
coroner got a time of death?
almost down to the minute.
now, nobody knows this, but unlike our previous three victims victim number four was not completely beheaded.
what does that mean, "not completely" ?
he started the job, but a fire alarm went off at exactly 7: 17 last night.
it apparently spooked him, sent him fleeing before he could finish.
he didn't happen to leave behind...?
victim number three's head?
unfortunately not.
Hi. Joe dubois.
Mr. Dubois, this is cooper conroy. We met several days ago.
Yes, mr. Conroy, I know I haven't gotten back to you.
things have actually gotten a little more complicated with my employer.
they want me to sign some papers before they'll let me go back to work, and...
I need to meet you tomorrow.
maybe at the same coffee shop, 10: 00?
sure. Is everything all right?
I'll see you at 10: 00, mr. Dubois.
I'm heading out.
you're the last one here.
you okay?
I'm, uh...
I'm great, actually.
Really? What are you taking and where can I get some?
Allison, I do believe I have survived the worst day of my career, and I can'texplain it, really, except to saythat people get it.
the mayor gets it, the governor gets it.
everyone understandswe make mistakes, and I find that gratifying, exhilarating.
have you checked in at home?
no, it's weird.
there are no reporter scamped out on the front lawn.
the kids were fine at school.
I guess at the end of the day, pamela franklin's murder was a bigger story than you or your oddball sidekick.
Oh, excuse me, I didn't know anyone was here.
how did you not hearthe hair dryer?
I'm sorry, I...
can you just please get out?
you want me to come back later?
no, I don't want you to come back ever.
do you see this?
this means do not disturb, okay?
I don't care about the stupid sheets or the towels.
I don't want anyone in my room.
not with everything that'sgoing on around here.
and when I checked in, I told you people that.
it's a very generous, generous offer.
may I?
Yes. - Thank you.
this has been cleared?
and that is money you will actually see, not money you have to fight for in a court of law for six or seven years.
sorry, I, uh, didn't realize anyone was in here.
Mr. District attorney. - Manuel.
will you two just, uh, give me a moment?
sure.
I'm sorry to surprise you.
that meeting came together very quickly.
I apologize if anything looks untoward, manny, but the mayor, the governor, everyone just felt that the most efficient path to a quick settlement out of court would be to put a new face...
a quick settlement? What are you talking about?
they're threatening to file a wrongful prosecution suitagainst the city- $50 million.
and I've been told to take the lead on this.
get out in front of it,so that's what I'm doing.
again, I apologize that you wereout of the loop. I...
no, I certainly see the wisdom in having a new face broker that sort of conversation.
I appreciate you understanding, manny.
well, I'd better get back inside. We're sort of at a delicate spot.
of course.
good morning.
we'll see about that.
you have to listen to what I'm about to tell you.
I have no interest in anything you have to say.
you think the storm is over, you think the worst is past, but you're wrong.
it's only just begun.
even as we speak, I have to believe that the people above him are doing everything they can to isolate your boss and completely distance themselves from you.
fine.
there's going to come a time when you're going to want to get your side of the story out.
and there's gonna be all kinds of people vying for that story.
I hope you'll think of me.
you're insane! - Whatever you say.
after all you've done to me, after all you've done to my family, why would I ever speak to you again?
come on, allison, I'm the devil you know.
sorry, I'm late. - Not to worry.
my employer, my boss gave me this to sign.
it came with a very generous check.
but the implication was pretty clear:
if you don't sign this, you can't come back to work.
well, then by all means, you should sign it.
I don't think you understand. It's a liability waiver of some kind.
um, I think that if I sign this, it's going to make it very difficult for you for you to take them to court.
you might want to take a look at it.
I don't need to look at it.
this woman who's helped the D. A. get in all this trouble, she's your wife, isn't she?
Why? What does that have to do with anything?
well, according to these articles, she claims to talk to dead people.
do you believe that?
you believe she talks to dead people?
actually, I do.
but what does this have to...?
and you'd swear to that under oath?
Mr. Dubois, for me to prevail in this case,
I have to convince a jury to believe you, to believe in you.
if before I can do that, I have to convince them that dead people talk to your wife...
I would sign that paper.
cash that check.
it was very nice meeting you, sir.
first pitch to him...
testing test, one, two.
testing test, one, two.
get the hitter to chase that rising fastball, but the two-one pitch.
swing at the ball, hit in the aiinto foul territory in shallow right.
the 1- oh pitch on the way.
Mr. Paxton, thank you for coming. - Oh, how could I not?
you've been my greatest supporter, my greatest defender.
just trying to get to the truth, which is what I wanted to talk to you about.
I believe there's a book in all of this, in everything that's happened to you; an important one-- my publisher does, too.
I was hoping I might persuade you to collaborate.
the two-one pitch.
there's a swing and a soft liner...
arizona's down by three.
tough luck for arizona.
and anyonewho has a bet on them.
the shortstop will make a nice throw over to first.
I know they've frozen your bank accounts while they hash out the details of your wife's estate.
my publisher is willing to extend their generous advance immediately.
I don't need money, ms. Mccall.
Oh, well, you'll need to live on something while you mount a suit against the city.
you know about that?
I know a lot of things.
litigation can takea long time, and my sense is that district attorney devalos is not inclinedto settle quickly.
well, I have reason to believe that that decision will soon be out of the district attorney's hands.
I appreciate your offer, miss mccall.
I'll look forward to reading your next article.
struck him out and now he is just one out...
I don't appreciate your attitude, ariel!
I've had a horrible day, too.
Bridgette, can you get marie a snack?
mommy wants to get out of her work clothes.
that must be nice.
it isn't.
hello.
good- bye.
who was that?
some reporter from some paper.
they've been calling all afternoon, which I really don't appreciate because I'm waiting for a call from my boss.
your boss? Why?
have you decided whether or not to sue?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, the lawyer made it real easy for me.
Really? What'd he say?
he said he was dropping meas a client.
he seemed to think that in light of recent events, that, uh,
I might have a bit of a credibility problem with the juries.
cause of me.
hello.
good- bye.
did something else happen?
that phone all of a sudden is ringing off the hook.
Yeah, something's happened.
the whole world's fallen off its axis.
what does that mean? - I don't know.
I went to work-- no devalos; he's just not there.
I can't get a straight answer from anybody.
I call his house, no answer.
turns out that his friend they brought in to help is suddenly running the place.
he sends an assistant over to me to tell me that my part-time consulting services probably won't be needed for the foreseeable future.
ariel hates me because some kid at school found out that she got the highest grade on the algebra test, and they're convinced that I got the answers from that morrissey kid who died in that swimming mishap last summer.
come on.
I had a dream last night, the fourth victim has a spare head in her hotel fridge, which would either imply that she is the killer and killed herself or...
or?
or debra is right, and I'm crazy, and this whole dreaming thing isn't all it's cracked up to be.
so we're not suing?
no?
so there's no millions, no tens of millions.
uh, no, I'm going back to my old job.
thousands, tens of thousands.
because of me.
no, cause that's the way it should be.
I never really felt right in profiting from all that death.
the truth is I miss my work.
so I'm okay.
if my boss would only call me back.
and what about devalos and your crazy dream and your angry daughter?
what are we going to do about that?
I just want to go to sleep and not wake up for 20 years.
I like that.
deal with your problems head on.
I'll go look in on ariel.
you get some rest.
housekeeping.
Housekeeping!
can you step back please, so I can see you?
sorry about that.
I guess I'm a little paranoid with everything on the news.
you know what? Forget about the bathroom.
I'm just now running a bath.
would you mind just leaving me towels and making up the bed?
Thanks.
excuse me. I thought I told youto just do the bed...
No!
Lynn, hi. This is allison dubois.
I'm sorry to bother you so late.
that's okay, allison.
I'm just getting home from a task force meeting.
what can I do for you? - I'm looking for lee.
I can't seem to get a hold of him you haven't seen him, have you?
no. I mean, he was at this meeting, but where he went after that?
you know lee. - Do me a favor.
if you see him, will you let him know that I need to speak with him?
will do.
perfect.
Allison. I thought we were friends.
I thought I could count on you, you and devalos.
I have things to tell you!
I am still dreaming about this case!
look, I understand that manny is in hot water.
I know you're on thin ice where you are, but...
we are friends, but it's really not smart for me to be seen talking to you.
not here. Not now.
and as for manny... - yeah, okay, let's talk about him.
I get it. Someone told him to stay home.
but neither of you takes my calls?
Allison, manny is on a boat in the gulf of mexico fishing.
he isn't taking anybody's calls!
and when he comes back... if he comes back...
it'll be because the city of phoenix gets walter paxton to sign a settlement agreement.
and, hopefully, for a lot less than $50 million!
and as for you, what do you want me to say?
you're toxic! You just are! So I'm sorry.
given the way things are going, nobody wants to hear your dreams!
nobody wants to hear from allison dubois.
all right, I'm sorry. Tell me. I want to hear it.
tell me your dream.
Pamela franklin. Victim four.
I saw her put on a maid's uniform, talk her way into cheryl ann potts' room.
she brought knives.
she brought victim number two's head.
it doesn't make any sense.
I know it doesn't make complete sense, but it answers a lot of questions.
like? - Like how does he get into the room?
he impersonates a housekeeper. The victims let him in.
and why is it we can't figure out who he is?
cause he isn't a he at all.
that's very nice. It's... it's...
it's very interesting.
but aren't you leaving something out?
I don't know who killed pamela franklin.
maybe it's someone outside this whole situation.
maybe that's why he didn't finish chopping her head off.
maybe that's why he didn't leave behind victim number three's head.
or you're just wrong.
like you've been on just about every aspect of this one.
go home, allison.
let us figure this one out the old-fashioned way.
the way we used to do it.
you still interested in talking to me? Cause no one else is.
I need you to do something for me. I need you to change hotels.
and I need you to do it now.
so what's going to happen to me this time?
what?
you know, I just realized that it seems like you're always expecting a call.
Oh. Yeah.
trade secret. It's also a digital recorder.
I like to make sureI have it out when I'm about tohave a conversation that might be quote-worthy.
so why am I changing hotels?
I had another dream last night.
of course you did. - I saw the third murder.
Really? You saw it?
so who did it? - Doesn't matter.
I beg to differ, allison. It's all that matters.
no. You don't understand. I saw the third murder.
I thought it was important. I went to the police.
I tried telling them about my dream.
but of course, they won't listen to me anymore.
they can't listen to me anymore.
I was really upset.
I really started to believe that there was no one to tell, no one that mattered.
and then I realized there was still you.
and in a strange way, you're the only one who ever really mattered anyway.
because, debra, you're still next.
Wow. You're like adog with a bone.
listen. Follow my reasoning.
victim number four's head was never completely severed from her body.
so the killer didn't leave victim number three's head in its place.
which means it's still out there.
which means it could still be placed on your body after the killer kills you.
if you stay in this hotel...
Allison, you already made this prediction, and I'm happy to say it didn't come true.
no. I was right about everything except for the numbers.
it all still works if you're the fifth victim.
if you're next.
in my dream, he said there were five victims.
I saw victim number three's head on your body.
I just assumed it was a natural mistake, but now I have figured it out. You're next.
Allison, you're not making any sense again.
if you were really concerned about me...
if you did actually see the third killing
wouldn't it just be a whole lot easier to tell everyone who did it?
who the killer is?
no. Because it wouldn't clarify anything.
and actually,
I'm beginning to believe that there must be two killers.
two killers?
in my dream...
the person that I saw kill cheryl ann potts was pamela franklin.
dead pamela franklin? The fourth victim?
which is the reason I believe there are two killers
Pamela franklin and the person who killed - pamela franklin. - Pamela franklin.
so come on. Just...
just do it. Just change hotels.
you really are crazier than I thought.
truly certifiable.
and you know the craziest part?
you know how I absolutely know you're out of your mind?
after all I've done to you, you are still here trying to save my life.
okay. Ooh! You're right.
you know what? I'm crazy. Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
Yeah, I'm crazy.
so just, you know... just humor me.
come on. What will happen? Nothing.
you'll still be alive. I'll still be crazy.
you can laugh about the delusional lady who talked you into changing hotel rooms in phoenix.
you can even...
you can even write a chapter of your book about it.
come on. What's the downside?
I'll even help you pack.
but what if I'm wrong?
what if you're not delusional? No.
I'm going to be as good to you as you're being to me.
I think I'm going to stay here, and let the recapitator come and get me.
I mean, think about it.
if it's true-- if you're right,
then it would be a great vindication of you and everything you stand for.
I owe you that.
now leave.
or I'll call the police.
and I'm reasonably sure they'll listen to everything I have to say.
Hi, elizabeth.
listen, I know that I don't have an appointment, but I was just wondering if I could get two minutes with him.
I have these papers that he asked me to sign.
I just wanted to find out about a couple of things.
let me stick my head in there, see what I can do.
well, this is embarrassing.
I don't know how I...
what?
he's actually not in there...he's off-site today.
Mr. Dubois, please...
Hello, joe. - Hello, marcus.
I brought your papers back. They're signed.
that's all right.
I'm afraid the insurance company had a change of heart about you.
I know that they became nervous when you didn't sign at first.
well, what can I do to calm them down?
I'm not going to sue, marcus, I promise you.
I just want to go back to work.
I just want things to go back to the way they were a month ago.
Joe, if I can't insure you,
I can't bring you back.
of course you can, this is your company, I'm your employee, you know me.
Yes, joe, it is my company, but if I violate my agreements with my insurers,
I will have no company, no government contracts, no lines of credit.
300-and-some-odd people will be out of work.
I'm sorry.
you're backing me into a corner, marcus.
you see that, don't you?
I mean, if you don't bring me back,
I...I'm gonna have no choice, I have to sue you.
I know... but that we're covered for.
I like having sandwiches for dinner.
I think we should always have sandwiches for dinner.
it's just funner than hot food.
quiet, bridge.
mom and dad are thinking.
4382.0
that's the minimum that we've got to come up with each month.
that's mortgage, car insurance, food.
$4, 500... that's the magic number.
honey, how much am I worth?
baby...
you're worth everything to me.
no. I mean, money.
well... let's see.
my late wife was worth about...
$88 million, so...
as soon as you become mrs. Walter paxton, you'll be worth 44.
and when will that be? When will I get to bemrs. Walter paxton?
well, it can't be too soon. That would be...
unseemly.
do you miss her?
you miss your wife?
Pamela, I slit her throat, then I cut off her head with an electric knife, and kept it in formaldehyde for six months.
if I did miss her,
I'd have no one to blame but myself, wouldn't you think?
I love you, pamela.
I think that's pretty clear.
I love you, too, walter.
I know.
I knew it the second you said yes, the second you said you'd kill that woman for me, both of them.
how could I say no?
it was such a great plan.
you kill your wife, give her head to me, and go to jail, but six months later,
I kill a random woman and leave your wife's head behind, so they know it couldn't have been you, and two days later, I do it again, just so they're sure.
and then we live happily ever after...
get married.
well, after tonight.
that's right, after tonight.
one more tonight.
who's the lucky lady?
that would be you.
ask me again how much you're worth.
writer found headless in hotel room
tomorrow morning, I will be convening a meeting of every detective on the force.
there's going to be a lot of changes made in the way we do things around here.
and I just, I want to be clear.
I don't see a bright future for you here in phoenix.
Hey.
well, look who's here.
aren't you the lady who predicted PD.Mccall's murder?
allow me to introduce myself.
I'm the guy who canceled her round the clock protection so that your prediction could come true.
I went to look for you at police headquarters.
they said they thought you were here.
Yeah, well...
this new substitute D. A. Van dyke's taken a special shine to me.
I'm heading out right now to key his car. You want to come?
I had another dream. - Fabulous. Was I in it?
more importantly, was I employed?
we were right.
we were right the whole time; it was paxton.
Walter paxton killed his wife.
his lover was pamela franklin.
she killed all the others to convince the world that he was innocent, then he killed her.
and I'm figuring, last night, he killed P. D.Mccall.
Really? Walter paxton?
the man we already prosecuted and released?
the man who's suing the city for $50 million?
that walter paxton?
come on. Come on, lee.
you just admitted I wasright about P. D.Mccall, and I'm telling you, I'm right about this, too.
let's go tell that van dyke guy.
van dick? I don't think so.
you know how he's spinning this to the press?
you didn't predict it, you inspired it.
by making this crazy prediction, you gave this lunatica fabulous new target.
and me, I'm the idiot who left her vulnerable to the attack.
I don't care what he thinks about me.
and you shouldn't care what anybody thinks about you.
we just have to get paxton.
we're not going to get paxton, no one is.
Walter paxton's bullet proof.
at this point, nobody can accuse him of anything.
I'm telling you, if he got caught robbing a bank tomorrow, they'd have a parade for him.
he personally murdered three people, and he helped plan the murder of two others.
that's all well and good, allison, but you don't have any evidence.
your dreams are not evidence.
would it be possible for you to get me into debra's hotel room?
it's 4: 45 in the morning.
I need you out of here before the techiess how up again at 8: 00.
that shouldn't be a problem.
I'm sorry to leave you on your own, but I got to run home and shower.
my fellow incompetent detectives and
I have been summoned to the conference room at7: 00 A. M.
for a what I know is gonna be a truly inspirational ball busting.
it'll be fine.
come on, debra.
talk to me, show me something.
Hello?
is this the same case you were working on yesterday?
I'm guessing you're a lawyer.
Oh, no. I didn't actually finish law school.
I work for the district attorney
uh, manuel devalos.
sounds impressive.
I feel so badly for you.
I feel so badly for your boss.
they're just destroying him on television.
I know.
I can't help but think a lot of that's my fault.
how do you mean? - Before paxton...
this is a surprise.
is this a bad time?
absolutely not, no. Come in.
Thanks.
excuse the mess.
forgive me; I'mexpecting a call.
can I get you a drink? A mini drink from my minibar?
no, I'm good.
I was, uh...
thinking about our conversation the other day.
you called it.
I've only been out three days, and already I'm broke.
so I was wondering if we could have one more conversation about that book deal.
you did say something about an advance?
would $10, 000 tide you over?
I think if you were willing to sign some papers in the morning,
I'm fairly sure my publishercould come up with at least thatfairly quickly.
that would be a lifesaver.
so... what do you hear?
are the police any closer to figuring out who's doing this?
well, I did hearone really nutty theory today.
but it's not going to make you feel any better.
it's pretty out there.
what's that?
two killers. - Two killers?
are you sitting down?
obviously you are. I can see that.
Pamela franklin and whoever killed pamela franklin.
well, I don't get that.
why would she kill all those people?
and who's saying that? Is it the police?
and who are they saying pamela franklin killed, everybody except herself?
no, I don't get that.
I don't know if the person who told me this even knows.
and, no, it's not the police, not really.
Yeah, I think the thinking was that pamela killed everyone and then someone killed her.
but nobody is saying who that someone might be?
and why would that woman want to kill my wife?
well, you don't know.
this may have nothing to do with your wife.
it may only be about...
the second victim.
and all the other deaths were committed to throw people off the scent.
or it could have been about the third victim.
but you know what? I haven't really given it much thought, but the truth is women don't really do these things, not on their own.
go into a hotel room and cut off someone's head? No.
I'm betting when the smoke clears, if she was doing it, she was doing it for a man.
not to sound sexist, but it's always a man.
she was in love with someone, someone she couldn't have and...
And?
and nothing.
we have a problem.
what's that? - I didn't bring my tools.
don't go away.
all right, ladies and gentlemen, five women are dead now
all brutally murdered by the same sociopath.
are you embarrassed? Are you ashamed?
I know I am.
our local hotels and restaurants are losing millions in revenue.
our convention center is empty.
every day brings a new cancellation.
well, I won't have it, not on my watch.
I'm not going down like my predecessor.
I like beingthe new D. A. Of phoenix.
well, before you get too comfortable...
I would appreciate it if you would issue an arrest warrant for walter paxtonin the death of P. D.Mccall.
here's the evidence, on this tape recorder.
you can thank me later.
can you tell me what happened at the end of last season of Medium?
Oh, it was very... It was a really nice story.
Joe was held hostage.
there was gunshots.
there were five of us in that room.
only two of us made it out alive.
so he was told by his lawyer that he could actually sue.
my name is Cooper Conroy.
I'm an attorney, Mr. Dubois.
can you talk for a moment?
talk about what?
about the millions of dollars I believe you're entitled to.
what is this? It's a liability waiver.
so you're saying that if I don't sign these, I can't come back to work?
Allison was begging Neve Campbell, the reporter chick, not to print the truth about her.
that reporter had to be, like, a little snitch.
you cannot run this story! Debra!
please!
what about my life?!
my husband's life?
my children's lives?
and now Allison's whole life is in turmoil and in jeopardy.
well, the press is after her.
can you talk about your relationship as a spiritual advisor to the district attorney?
do you actually talk to dead people?
her boss is about this close to losing his job.
this new D. A. came in, started cleaning house, and no one seemed to have wanted Allison's services anymore.
I'd like you all to meet an old law school buddy of mine,
Tom Van Dyke, Assistant District Attorney out of Flagstaff and a good friend.
well, I went to work.
no Devalos. He's just not there.
turns out his friend they brought in to help is suddenly running the place.
he sends an assistant overto me to tell me that my part-time consulting services probably won't be needed for the foreseeable future.
look, I understand that Manny is in hot water.
I know you're on thin ice where you are, but neither of you takes my calls?
Allison, Manny is on a boat in the Gulf of Mexico fishing.
and as for you, what do you want me to say? You're toxic!
given the way things are going, nobody wants to hear your dreams.
nobody wants to hear from Allison Dubois.
now they both don't have jobs.
how are they going to survive?
I don't know what they're going to do.
Yeah, I don't know.
Yeah, that makes no sense to me.
no. We've been negotiating this deal for three and half months.
now he's insisting we close it this second?
no. You can't conference him in right now.
I'm with Ben.
what? Uh, hold on.
I'm losing you.
Yeah. Hold on a second.
Ben, come here, buddy.
dad? Yeah, uh...
fine. All right, put him through.
uh, no, no, sorry, Mr. Rivercott.
can you just give me one second, please?
Yes, Mr. Rivercott. I'm here.
Yes, sir, and I'm ready to do some business.
well, if that's all that's standing between us and a deal, sir, I'm sure we can...
Ben? Buddy, can you hear me?!
Oh, God. Ben!
Oh. Oh.
what?
did you say something?
dream.
a little boy.
a kidnapping, I think.
Oh.
what are you going to do?
here. You want to call someone?
there's no one to call.
don't you reiember?
Oh, yeah.
I guess for a minute there,
I was hoping that was just a dream.
Oh, no, not again.
Ugh!
we really need to have a boy.
Mm...
and in the forecast- oudy, windy and cold.
I'm just saying, I don't think it's fair.
fair? I don't think it's about fair.
I mean, if what you're saying is true, I'm sure it's just 'cause they want to know that whoever they give the lead role to can handle the pressure and the responsibility.
being in a new school and balancing that with all the homework.
so you agree?
you think it's just fine that because I'm in the ninth grade, and it's my first year in high school that I shouldn't play the lead in the school play?
even though it's the perfect play for me and it's the perfect role for me and I'm perfect for it?
here, babe.
it's no good.
I'm sorry, baby.
that's all the peanut butter we have left.
mom, what do you think?
what do I think?
I think just because all the other kids are saying ninth graders never get the lead doesn't make it so.
I think you ought to wait to see that you didn't get the part before you get all upset.
great. Just my luck.
when I'm in ninth grade, they do The Sound of Music.
and then, when I'm in tenth, they'll do The Wiz or Dreamgirls. Just watch.
Yeah, it's tough looking like you.
and now authorities and the young man's family are asking for your help.
Oh, no.
a $20, 000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the recovery of Ben Goldman, and both the Chief of Police and acting District Attorney Van Dyke have pledged...
D. A.'s Office.
of course, the election is still several months away, and just to put some things in perspective, only about 32% of the eligible electorate is even aware that there's going to be an election.
but among those that are, slightly more than 70% recognized your name, and about half of them indicated that they were favorably disposed to seeing you continue...
excuse me a moment.
can you tell him it's about the missing Goldman boy?
I- I think I may be able to help.
I think I may know some things.
as soon as he returns to the office, I'll give him the message.
and you have all my num...?
boy and girls?
okay, I need everyone's attention, because today we have a special guest.
so our mouths are closed and our eyes and ears are open.
and now- and this is pretty exciting
I'm going to introduce a real, live police detective.
from our very own Phoenix Police Force, let's welcome
detective...
is it, uh, Scanlawn?
I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown.
who am I speaking with?
it's Allison. It's Allison Dubois.
uh, please don't hang up.
I know you're not supposed to take my calls.
I know I'm persona non grata.
Allison, we've been through this.
I had a dream about the Goldman boy.
I called the District Attorney's Office.
I left Van Dyke a message.
I know he's never going to call me back.
I called the Phoenix P. D. I can't get a detective to take my call.
I don't know what to tell you.
well, I have to do something.
I can't see what I see, know what I know, and not do anything with it, not tell anyone.
I can't go buy peanut butter and pretend that I didn't see it.
Allison, they've got me doing public relations now.
I'm about the furthest thing there is from a homicide detective.
you are the closest thing to a homicide detective I know.
tell me what you saw.
it happened in a toy store.
they already know that.
he used a doll, a marionette, to lure the boy.
Allison, none of this stuff matters.
it has to matter.
why would I see it?
why would someone bother to show it to me if it didn't matter?
did you see him?
did you see the man who took the boy?
not from the front.
he was wearing a... green jacket.
a green denim jacket.
all right, fine. Green denim.
I'll tell someone.
whether they listen, whether they care
I can't control that.
Hi.
have a seat.
last time you applied for unemployment benefits?
God.
uh, sometime in the eighties.
hmm.
um...
engineer?
aerospace.
so, um, what are we doing to find work?
I'm sending out letters of inquiry.
I'm, you know, calling friends and going to conferences.
it's tough because there are really only two other aerospace companies in the area that do the work in the fields that I specialize in, so it's...
I got three kids in school, so we-we really don't want to leave the area.
you're in a tough spot.
made good money, too.
never see it coming, do you?
Oh, my goodness.
I take that back.
maybe you did see it coming.
I mean, maybe your wife did anyway.
all right. Thanks.
Oh, ma'am, that card's being denied.
do you have another card?
no, I-I don't need another card.
there's a mistake.
I know this card's good.
I just paid the bill a couple weeks ago.
is there a problem? I have things I need to do.
there's no problem.
we're just sorting something out here.
okay, ma'am, that card's just going to keep being denied.
and if you swipe it one more time,
I'm just going to get a message to take it away from you.
you got cash?
well, not enough for all this stuff.
okay.
all right, let's just figure out what you really need, okay?
my name? Rolen.
uh, I think I may have some information ???
$240 a week.
you work for the same company 15 years.
the government takes thousands of dollars every month, and then when you get fired, when you can't get work, they give you $240 a week.
and act like you really ought to be ashamed of yourself for even asking for it.
the guy at the unemployment office recognized our last name.
he knew about you.
Oh...
maybe I should take Marie out of preschool.
I'm home now.
it's not like she has to be there.
no, don't do that. We're not there yet.
hell, haven't you been listening?
I just got us $240 a week to blow on anything we want.
Oh.
Hey, what is it?
why are you breathing so hard?
What'd you see, hmm?
he's white.
or at least his feet are white.
what I think he's doing to that little boy...
is there anyone to call?
is there anything to do?
no.
Scanlon What's that, Bobby, a joint?
two wrongs don't make a right, Bobby.
I know, they make a left.
just say "no.
eat me, stupid.
haven't you heard? Drugs are bad.
puppets.
they, uh...
they want me to try 'em with the older kids.
third graders.
I hate my life.
you're still a detective.
what are you talking about?
what it says on my badge?
no. Yes.
if you think you know something, if you think you can help...
I don't know anything. But you said Allison Dubois called you with... With nonsense, with nothing that matters.
she told me that it happened in a toy store.
the father told us it happened in a toy store.
said the guy was wearing a green denim jacket.
besides, I'm on Romper Room duty. It's not my case.
make it your case.
go to the store. Look around.
flash your badge. Talk to people.
you're not listening. I'm on the Reefer Madness tour.
you're not listening, after hours.
look at the crime scene photos.
go see the family.
people don't get irate because there are too many cops asking questions.
tell them the mayor's office sent you.
tell them I sent you.
you don't get it. This new D. A...
let me handle the new D. A.
Hello?
I'm... sorry, may I ask who's calling?
this is Ameritips.
you called our 800 number and left us some information about ???
I'm following up.
my name is Cynthia Keener.
uh, right, um...
what can I do for you?
actually, I was wondering if we could meet.
you could come to our Phoenix office, or I could come to your home.
do we really have to meet?
well, I do need to follow up.
I guess it really depends if you're serious.
serious about the information you gave us.
serious about the reward.
uh, right, the reward.
I completely forgot.
I really don't feel comfortable meeting at my home.
you know the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall?
how about we meet in the food court?
say tomorrow at 11: 00?
okay.
how will I recognize you?
don't worry, I'll find you.
that's what I do for a living.
Hey, girls!
come on, hurry up!
daddy's going to pick up Marie and Bridgette and meet us at home.
Hannah, honey, do you need a ride home?
Oh, my God! I got called back for Maria this afternoon!
Oh, my God! I know!
Hey.
you nervous?
terrified.
look at her.
I know her.
Yeah, well...
she's in the tenth grade, and I hear she's amazing.
she's perfect for this.
I don't stand a chance.
Hey, the idea is to psych her out, not yourself.
never mind.
Hey, Brooke.
Hi, Hannah. What's going on?
I just...
I know you're going out there in a minute, and I don't want you to get rattled.
rattled bx what?
Ariel's mother is out there.
okay.
and you know who she is, right?
Yeah.
well, she's Ariel's mother.
and the thing is, she already knows her daughter's getting the part.
I mean, that's why she's sitting out there.
I just...
I didn't want you to see her and have it mess you up.
Brooke Greene? You're on.
thing is, we just closed, and it's pouring out.
couldn't we do this another time?
I mean, come on, you guys were here for two days. My employees are still crying about all the wages they lost.
Yeah, well, the store's closed now, and no one's losing a dime.
how about you just take 20 minutes and walk me through it?
what's in this direction?
two bathroom doors, both locked, employees lounge and lockers, warehouse space for additional inventory.
other cops already been through it twice.
Yeah, well, you know what they say.
third time's a charm.
who do you say you work for again?
the Mayor?
that's what I said.
I hate him.
Oh, don't tell me we have a leak.
I just had this damn roof re-tarred a month ago.
you use red tar?
what are you talking about?
what's above us?
toys, what do you think?
who's up here?
someone's up here! It's the mice.
when it rains they come inside.
it's the mice.
am I above the spot where that drop hit me?
you gotta go towards the rail.
Hey, hey, take it easy up there!
I gotta sell that stuff.
he's not here.
is he?
what are you talking about? Who?
I don't know.
I think I was asleep.
then I felt it.
his head on my chest.
he was lying on top of me.
and it was so real.
I mean, I...
I could smell his hair.
why doesn't someone call?
ask for ransom?
or the the police?
why don't the police call?
someone.
I think he's gone.
I think he just came to me...said "good-bye.
I think that's what it was.
what? What is it?
he's dead.
I think the little Goldman boy is dead.
no... I don't think so, honey.
I just got into bed.
I just got done watching the news.
they didn't say a word about it.
what are you talking about?
it's the middle of the night.
no, Allison, it's 11: 45.
you went to bed just after 10: 00.
I stayed up to watch the news.
I'm telling you.
who you calling?
I'm calling Scanlon.
maybe he knows something.
Hello?!
I'd like to speak with the officer in charge.
Hello?!
would someone point me towards the lead detective, please?
that would be me.
you?
you found the boy?
I was unaware that you were even assigned to this case, Detective.
some friends in the mayor's office asked me to look into it.
kind of like an after school project.
who knows?
who else knows about this?
just me and the store manager.
coroner's on his way.
other than that...
you haven't spoken to any press?
I called your office, the District Attorney's Office.
that's the protocol.
that's what I did.
this boy's parents are in a lot of pain.
I'd like to try to keep this under wraps for another 12 hours or so, at least until the coroner and forensics have had a chance to take a look.
maybe generate some clues, get us closer to the animal who did this.
I think that would make this a much easier pill for the parents to swallow.
for everyone to swallow.
certainly make for a better story in the press.
can I count on your discretion, Detective?
can I sleep on it?
no. Not unless you plan on sleeping alone.
let's keep your girlfriend out of this.
I'm tired of her calls on your behalf.
I need to know if I can count on you.
I don't know what to tell you.
it's after midnight and I have to get up in five hours to talk to a group of student crossing guards about the importance of walking on the green and not in between.
Really?
I'm sure I could find somebody else to take care of that for you.
a valuable man like you, you should be out in the field.
a valuable man like you should be leading investigations for my office.
it's not here.
what's not there?
something I was sure would be.
so now you're the star of the play?
it's high school.
there are no stars, but... I'm the lead.
cool.
do you know where Daddy is?
no, I agree with you, Mom.
Yes.
no, I agree with Oprah.
in a civilized society, women should wear underwear, particularly if they're public figures, getting out of cars, being photographed.
mom...
Yeah, Mom... Mom. Mom.
I need to borrow some money.
have I made a mistake?
Ameritips.
Allison? Hi.
I thought I was going to meet you ten minutes at the food court.
Oh, I just, well, um...
I was early, and I saw you standing there.
at Least I thought it was you standing there.
I'm kind of intuitive that way.
is-is this all right?
I'd be happy to wait till 11: 00.
Oh, this is fine, this is fine.
I know it sounds so ancient, but I wanted to be a nun.
you just don't hear that anymore, but I did.
I wanted to wear a habit and sit in the front row Christmas mass, get mentioned in Father's sermons.
so I took temporary vows of poverty, celibacy and obedience.
and I don't know what happened to the vows of poverty and celibacy, but it soon became very evident that I had no talent whatsoever for obedience.
so, then I decided to go into the family business, become a cop.
I went to college, I studied criminology.
me, too.
back then, for a woman, it was... tough.
anyway, I saw an ad for Ameritips.
and I've been an investigator with them for 20 years.
and I got my wish
I'm poor, I'm celibate, and I don't have to listen to anyone.
how many people phoned in about the Goldman boy?
we logged about 1, 400 calls.
1, 400 calls?
most of those are cranks and others are people fishing for the reward money.
the credible ones really jump out at you, which is why I'm here.
green, denim jacket.
that's rather specific, isn't it?
of course, it's not the kind of clue that's going to get you a reward.
Oh, I don't care about the reward.
I don't care about the money.
the money would be good- it would be great- but...
I really can't get that little boy out of my mind.
I know what you mean.
this is a ground floor plan of the toy store where the Goldman boy was abducted.
I wonder if you wouldn't mind indicating with the cursor where you were when you saw the man take him.
what do you mean?
well, the "X" here is where Mr. Goldman said his son was standing the last time he saw him.
and this green "X" here is the position of the father.
where would you have been?
I mean, you would have had to have been fairly close to see that the jacket was denim.
were you in the store at all, Allison?
enjoy your iced tea.
you should Google me.
my married name is Dubois.
I know what I'm talking about.
the jacket is green.
and the man who took him?
he likes to dance.
and...
I think the little boy is dead.
you think the little boy is dead?
well, I work for the parents, and I think I would know if the little boy is dead.
I think you're one of the cruelest people I've ever met.
well, I'm not trying to be.
I saw his spirit visit his parents last night.
you saw?
look me up.
it's on your computer.
right there for all the world to see.
catch a tiger by the toe.
I know what I want for Christmas. If he hollers...
I want my own room.
...Let him go.
what are you doing?
choosing who's going to take me to school.
well, now that you guys don't have to be anywhere in the morning...
I miss work.
me, too.
what do you mean there's no evidence, Detective?
this, this little boy's body is covered with evidence.
he is drenched in blood.
was he shot? Was he stabbed?
poisoned.
forced to ingest something- we don't know what yet
that very rapidly brought on massive dehydration, all the fluid in his body is just gone.
the skin tissue is nothing but a hard crust.
the blood you see there came from his eyes, his nose, his mouth, and his anus.
that's enough, Detective.
we're gonna begin reinterviewing all the store employees this morning.
I'm hoping that fairly soon the lab will be able to tell us the exact nature of the poison.
that should certainly help point us towards whoever might have done this.
I don't think we can keep a lid on it much longer.
I know you're not looking forward to calling the parents.
I'm just afraid if we don't...
too many people are aware- cops, lab technicians
for the media not to find out.
we don't have a single clue?
we don't have a single lead on who this might be?
well, there is one, but it's not much to hang your hat on.
I'm not even sure if it's credible.
I need something for the press.
he may have been wearing a green, denim jacket.
you found a fiber?
Allison Dubois had a dream.
sir?
I'll, uh, call the parents,
I'll notify the media the boy is dead.
there are no leads at the present time.
this shocking news just in.
the Coroner's office confirming that the body of Ben Goldman, that young boy reported missing since last week, was apparently discovered by authorities sometime yesterday.
details of the discovery are not being shared with reporters, nor is there any press conference scheduled at this time.
I could never do that.
what are you talking about?
you have the part.
yeah...
but nobody was more surprised than I was when it happened.
I was sure it was going to be you.
what?
your mother didn't tell you?
tell me what?
she seemed to think you knew.
she seemed to think you dreamt it and made it so.
there was no use in even trying...
well, I didn't dream it.
the first I heard about you being called back was when you told me.
the first...
I heard about you getting the part was when you got it.
mom, this girl is Maria.
Hi, Mom.
Hey!
I thought you guys were here the whole time.
daddy let us play at the park until the Police came and kicked us out!
turns out the place closes at dark, which makes no sense to me.
where are High School kids supposed to go and do the things they can't do at home if the park is closed?
dad!
did you grab the mail?
Yeah.
why, you expecting something?
I thought maybe Mom... Grandma...
might have sent me something.
Oh, what?
I asked her for a loan.
I tried to convince her it was gonna be cheaper than bail.
Oh, Joe...
she said she was gonna think about it.
talk to her accountant.
I guess I was just kind of hoping that her answer would be in the mail.
it's the mice.
when it rains they come inside.
it's the mice!
am I above the spot where that drop hit me?
you gotta go towards the rail.
Hey, hey!
take it easy up there!
I gotta sell that stuff!
come on, pick up your phone.
Allison, it's barely 6: 00.
he's probably sleeping.
the nut.
I don't know.
he's not taking my calls lately.
he hasn't been returning them either.
Hi. This is Detective Lee Scanlon.
leave a message and I'll call you back.
I mean, what is it that you want him to say?
what is it that you want him to tell you?
I mean, you dreamt the boy was a mouse.
but clearly... he's not a mouse.
well... it means something.
who you calling now?
Lynn? It's Allison.
I need to speak to him.
um, he's not here.
Yeah, he left a half hour ago.
he's at the toy store.
they're reinterviewing all the employees before the place opens this morning.
you want the address?
now the last time you spoke to police you mentioned that you do open the store Mondays and Thursdays and that therefore you do have a key.
is that correct Mr...
Mr. Kaye?
there's a lady here to see you.
detective,
I'm Cynthia Keener.
I'm an investigator with Ameritips.
well...
you're here early.
didn't expect to see you till rehearsal this afternoon.
actually, that's why I came by.
I need you to listen to something.
what do you mean?
you want to sing something for me?
not exactly.
now, Mr. Kaye, obviously, what we need from you is someone to corroborate your whereabouts for the 24 hours prior tk the discovery of the Goldman boy.
you have another visitor.
a mouse?
it means something. I'm sorry.
not to me. Neither does the green denim jacket or the dancing.
I don't know what to tell you, Allison, but you can't hang around here.
I'm just starting to get some traction with the new D. A.
if he finds out you were here... Fine.
maybe you could do me a favor.
maybe you could give me a call when you're done with all this.
or maybe, uh...
maybe you could pick up the phone when I call you.
I could probably swing that.
I miss Devalos.
me, too.
I don't understand.
when we get back home...
what are we gonna do?
what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
I just can't spend another day waiting for permission to be who I am.
I'm a lawyer.
I practice law.
it's all I really know.
and if I can't do it for the people,
I'll open up my own office.
I'll start my own practice.
miss Heath...
apparently you also have a key.
what the hell is that? Who...
somebody unlocking the warehouse door.
well, I don't understand.
I thought everyone who had keys to the building were here this morning.
well, yeah.
everyone who works for us.
Oh.
sorry.
you, you guys having a meeting?
nobody told me.
and you are?
Oh, the exterminator.
we have a contract.
put some poison out the other day.
I'm just back to pick up the mice.
the mice?
mice.
rats.
they've had a real problem with them.
see, I put the poison out a couple of nights ago.
but thing is, once they eat that stuff, it makes them really stiff and bloody.
so you really want to get rid of them before it starts to smell, and it gets into the air-conditioning.
is it okay? I...
I won't make too much noise.
we should question him. He has a key.
uh, you know what?
I left my gloves in my other jacket.
I just gonna run to my truck.
uh, you mind if I come with?
Yeah.
a little bit.
who the hell are you?
I'm a detective with the Phoenix Police force.
I'm investigating the murder of a young boy.
I- I'd like to ask you some questions.
what was the color of that other jacket?
was it green?
hello.
green denim jacket.
he was doing a little dancy thing when he first walked in the room.
exterminator.
which I guess explains the mouse.
so what are you doing?
me, I'm just, uh...
I'm paying bills.
well, no, actually...
Lee, someone's at the door.
this guy Van Dyke- he's an idiot.
let me try and talk to him about you.
let me see if we can't get you back here...
at least part-time.
really. So they making snowballs in hell now?
Lee, let me call you back.
I Googled you.
apparently I owe you an apology.
this is a personal check.
this is your check.
why are you doing this?
I couldn't get you the reward.
um, you didn't find him
I mean, your clue didn't really find him
but I thought maybe we could keep in touch.
perhaps come to some sort of an arrangement.
not between you and Ameritips, but between you and me.
I'm an investigator, and someone like you...
I have a feeling that we could do each other a lot of good.
and as I mentioned the other night,
I'm really quite intuitive, too.
I'll be calling.
divorce lawyers like to say...
that "love" is the ultimate unenforceable contract.
it is always being re-negotiated by time.
whether it's the love of a husband for his wife...
or a parent for a child...
or even a lover for their sweetheart...
the day invariably arises when the contract, the agreements and understanding that define a relationship, change.
the function of time, familiarity or sometimes just Mother Nature.
well, well, if it isn't our own Deputy Doll. Back for another test?
I think the last one was defective.
the plus sign looks more like a division symbol, so I remain unconvinced.
third test today, Mama Bear.
your Eggo is preggo; no doubt about it.
silence, old man.
you pay for that pee stick when you're done.
don't think it's yours just 'cause you marked it with your urine.
but I don't get it.
why do I have to go to the doctor's office when I don't feel sick?
Well,'cause Mommy's working again and Daddy's working again, which means we have our insurance back.
so?
so, that means that we can go to the doctor, and somebody else will pay for it.
well, tell them to save their money. We're not interested.
we're all going to do it.
mommy's going to go see her doctor.
daddy's going to see his doctor this morning.
everybody's going to get a checkup.
Uh-oh, this isn't good.
when they say "checkup," they mean shots.
I don't want no, no shot.
hey now, just 'cause you're going to the doctor for a checkup doesn't mean you're going to get shots.
right. And fish can't swim.
I don't want a shot!
look at your sister, honey. You're getting her all upset.
Hey, I got an idea.
what if, um, we go to the doctor's office, and, well...
we get the shots, and then, afterwards, we go to the toy store and you guys let us pick out whatever we want?
what?
wait a second, where did you get that?
they do it on television.
actually, I've seen it a lot.
well, I'm not interested in talking about television, honey.
I got to go to my doctor's appointment.
us, too. Us, too.
got a minute for a friend?
councilman Leaming...
don't fire anyone. I told them not to announce me.
I'm here on unofficial business.
well, then let me give you one of these...
unofficially, of course. Save me a postage stamp.
what the hell's this, Manuel?
a party. It's Lily's idea, actually.
a way to sort of thank everybody who works here for hanging in there, keeping the faith while I was gone.
but don't worry, we're paying for everything.
not a dime of taxpayers' money.
what's going on, Jimmy?
you know my daughter Meredith-- finally got married a little more than a year ago.
nice fella. He has a little girl with heart trouble.
actually, that's how they met.
Meredith was the little girl's nurse.
two days ago she sent my wife and me this e-mail.
dear Mom and Dad, I'm embarrassed to tell you this, "but I think, for the first time in my life, "I understand what it means to hit rock bottom.
I think the only cure is time and distance.
I need to get away.
this isn't forever, it's just for now.
I promise to get in touch soon. Meredith.
I'm so sorry, Jim.
she sent one to her husband, too.
what can I do? How... can I help you?
she's been gone four days.
my wife, my son-in-law...
they're convinced that she's going to come back.
but this is a girl who's never gone more than 48 hours without calling me or her mother about some crisis or other.
did you go to the police? File a missing persons report?
I don't want to do that. I'm a councilman.
her husband's a big shot over at Phoenix West Bank.
they're going to want to question him.
and then the papers will get ahold of it... no.
you know, I have a couple of people who work for me, pretty good at this kind of thing.
and I know I can trust them to keep it to themselves.
why don't you let me see what I can do.
I need you to wake up.
Oh, hey, Doc.
Oh, sorry, must have dozed off.
Yeah, the nurse said she's been trying to wake you for ten minutes.
Devalos said you wanted to see me.
Yeah, I do indeed. I do indeed. What's with the funny look?
nothing. You've just been on my mind lately. You and Lynn.
well, how you guys doing?
we're doing... I mean, you know, to the extent we can.
haven't you got better things to think about?
maybe. Maybe not.
so what's all this?
one of Manny's city council buddies dropped by.
daughter ran out on her husband couple days ago.
Papa's stressing 'cause he doesn't know where she is.
pretty. - Smart. Went to school.
started premed, dropped out.
became a private nurse, which is when she met hubby.
was he sick? - His little girl. Born with a bad heart.
waiting for a transplant.
first wife couldn't take the pressure-- took off.
he finally got divorced in absentia and, uh...
nursie here, Meredith, took her place.
anyway, I'm going to do the credit card, cell phone monitoring thing.
see what she might have spent, where she might have spent it, who she might have called.
Devalos asked me to put this little care package together for you in hopes that you might do that voodoo you do, but I have a hunch our little wifey just parked herself in a four-star hotel somewhere.
nice car.
daddy's little girl has to have a nice car.
so Marie, little Marie, when he gave her shot, she smiled, Joe. And Bridgette, whoo.
you would have thought that he was performing open-heart surgery without anesthesia.
so afterward, I took them to the toy store.
I'm proud of you.
not letting your previously held convictions get in the way of making our children happy.
now, listen, I got to talk to you about something that happened at the doctor's office.
what are you talking about? You told me everything was fine.
Yeah, it is. Well, sort of.
he seemed to think that I have some kind of a sleep deprivation thing going on.
doesn't everybody over the age of 12 have a little sleep deprivation thing going on?
I don't know, he seemed to think that it was something to be taken seriously.
all right, well, what would make him think that?
I think he got his first inkling when I fell asleep in his waiting room this morning.
Oh, my.
the truth is, I am exhausted all the time.
at first, he wanted to check me into the hospital one night next week and do a sleep study.
that's where they hook you up to a computer and they...
they try to figure out what the problem is.
then after we... you know, we...
we talked for a little while, we both realized...
what, you both think this is my fault?
fault? Nobody mentioned fault. I didn't use the word "fault.
okay, what word would you use?
I don't want to use any word.
I think the doctor's just trying to figure out cause and effect.
I don't think that fault factors into it.
and I'm the cause.
okay, look, I wouldn't use the word "cause" either.
but, Allison, you've got to be realistic.
I mean, you're up once or twice a night, which means that I'm up once or twice a night.
the problem is, that after you tell me about your dream I can't get back to sleep.
I sit here and I stare and I wait for the sun to come up or for you to have another dream.
okay, so what does he want us to do?
what are we talking here? Ear plugs, or...
how do we handle this?
I don't want you to be exhausted.
initially, he wants us to try sleeping apart.
that's his plan?
just for a week.
I mean, I think it's more diagnostic than anything else.
you know, if after a week I'm feeling better, then...
what?
if after a week you're feeling better-- what? That we'd sleep apart forever?
doesn't sound like much of a plan.
well, that's not his plan, that's your plan.
I mean, I'm sure he's got some kind of a protocol in mind if this, you know, in fact, turns out to be the problem.
3: 20 in the morning.
you poor thing.
Allison Dubois asked for you today.
Oh, yeah? Did you say hi for me?
Yeah; course I did.
you look at the mail in the living room?
Devalos is having a party.
he's sweet. He sent one invitation to you here and one invitation to me at my place.
so should I just RSVP for the two of us?
I don't know. I can't even think about that right now.
be careful in there. Might still be a little toxic.
Really? Rough night?
morning sickness. Talk about false advertising.
of course, I guess if they called it all day, all night sickness, nobody would ever want to get pregnant.
daddy? Daddy?
daddy? Daddy...
daddy! Are you and Mommy having a divorce?
well, are you?
no, of course not. Nobody's getting a divorce.
why would you even think something like that?
Bridgette! - What?
all I said was that, right after Celeste McEvoy's dad started sleeping on the couch, they got a divorce. And they did.
and then you told Marie that her dad then took her to Universal in Florida for a week.
now she thinks we're going to Florida.
are we going to Florida?
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Nobody's getting divorced.
mom and Dad aren't getting divorced. Come here!
daddy just needed a good night's sleep, you know, 'cause sometimes your mom is, you know...
I can hear that.
Hey, why isn't everybody eating? Everybody should be eating. It's getting late.
Oh, hey, did you see the mail? Devalos is having a party.
daddy's taking me to Florida.
they started dredging the lake around 7: 00 this morning. By 8: 30, they found her.
Oh, my God!
I don't understand. This can't be Meredith Burnes.
she's only been missing three days.
this woman looks like she's been in the lake for years.
good guess. We're thinking two, actually.
she was wearing this. It's an engraved wedding band.
from Don to Clare. Always.
Clare? Who's Clare?
that would be Meredith's husband's first wife.
and this is her?
in the flesh... or the bones... or whatever.
so Don's first wife wasn't just missing. She didn't just run away. She was murdered.
well, yeah, obviously, she was murdered, but that doesn't mean she didn't run away first.
a stranger could have done this.
now his second wife is missing?
it certainly seems like being married to this Don fellow is a dangerous way to live your life.
I was so sure that I was seeing Meredith's murder. I even saw her car.
maybe her car was part of it. Maybe Don borrowed her car, used it to transport the body so there wouldn't be any DNA left in his.
you want to ask him?
can I help you?
I'm Detective Scanlon. This is Allison Dubois.
we're hoping to speak with Don Burnes.
I really can't see that. I'll have to take your word for it.
I lost my glasses a few days ago. Please come in.
I'm Louise Leaming. Meredith's mother. Councilman Leaming's wife.
nice to meet you, Mrs. Leaming.
this must be a terrible time for you.
not really. No. I... I... I told James not to bother you people with this.
Meredith's fine. She's... She will turn up.
she'll come home. She's just Meredith.
honey, tell your father that some people from the District Attorney's Office are here, all right?
did either of you ever meet Meredith?
no.
well, she's mine, and I love her, but she thrives on attention the way the rest of us depend on oxygen.
this is her idea of bliss.
everybody is worried about her, thinking about her, talking about her.
I shouldn't be negative.
she is an extraordinary caregiver; a wonderful nurse.
she has brought me the most marvelous grandchild.
she looks terrific, by the way. Phoebe, I mean.
heard about her heart condition. That she's waiting for a donor.
you would never know.
Oh, thank you. Yes. She's... She's at a good period right now.
last week, I... I was afraid we were going to lose her.
she still misses Meredith. That's why I'm here. To keep her mind off it.
I'm Don Burnes.
I'll keep Phoebe occupied while you three talk.
sit down, hm?
any news?
well, there is, but it doesn't have anything to do with Meredith.
we've found your first wife's remains, Mr. Burnes.
she was beaten and then drowned.
when? And by who?
we don't know that yet but, obviously, this changes the way we look at things with regard to the second Mrs. Burnes.
I see. So this is a dual purpose visit.
well, you're not being accused of anything at the moment, Mr. Burnes, but you're a person of interest.
we're in the process of obtaining a warrant to search your house.
you don't need a warrant.
you have my permission to look wherever you want.
Phoebe and I can go and stay with Meredith's folks for a few days, so there won't be anyone here in your way.
I appreciate you making this easy, Mr. Burnes.
I'll be sure and mention it to the District Attorney.
you do that.
also tell him that these women were taken fromme, not by me.
give him that message.
you got your cell phone in here?
no, it's in the kitchen, where I want it.
I'm sleeping out on the couch.
what? - You heard me.
if we're going to do this, we're going to take turns.
it's my turn to sleep on the couch tonight.
so I've unplugged the phone for you...
given you clean sheets.
I want you to get eight hours of beautiful, uninterrupted sleep.
Meredith-- right on time as always.
Mrs. Burnes.
this stuff is a drug, you know.
it's okay. It's legal. I'm a nurse.
so how's my girl doing today?
Ah, Phoebe? Not so well.
she, uh... had a rough night.
we all had a rough night.
I'm guessing she'll be sleeping for a while.
you sit here. I just need to finish this.
you relax.
you're the missus, I'm the help. Drink your poison.
I don't know about you, Meredith.
you're some kind of saint.
I keep saying to Don, "That woman, she is too good to be true.
she's got to be going home at night and kicking her cat.
never with my shoes on; only with my socks.
you all right, Mrs. Burnes?
don't worry. It'll be over soon.
good morning, Chef Boyardee.
I was trying to be quiet. Did I wake you?
no. Not you. Just the smell of all that good food.
you got a good night's sleep, didn't you?
I cannot tell a lie.
look at you. You're beaming. I hate that.
how wasyournight, my dear?
not for the faint of heart.
turns out that woman that we've been looking for-- Councilman Leaming's daughter...
yeah?
she murdered her husband's first wife.
now, what would posses somebody to do something like that?
I don't know.
maybe Don loved her. Maybe she loved Don.
maybe... maybe Don wasn't in on it.
maybe Don found out about it, and killed her to avenge his first wife's death.
do you see all the good stuff that you miss when you don't sleep with me?
we're almost ready. You want to go wake the kids?
Oh, that's right. We have kids.
Oh, gosh! I just remembered. Today is Dentist Day.
dentist Day? - Yeah. After school.
Oh, boy. More toys.
what time is it?
it's 10: 40 in the morning.
well, what are you doing here? I thought you were Miss Early Bird.
I like to be. But I need to talk to you about something.
and, lately, it seems like you only come home when you think I might be asleep, and you only wake up when you think I might be gone.
what is it, Lynn? What do you want to talk about?
I need to RSVP to that party.
okay.
well, you know what? Don't worry about it.
you take care of your RSVP, and I'll take care of mine.
so we're not going together?
I don't know; I have no idea.
I mean, to be perfectly honest with you, I've given this absolutely no thought.
frankly, I'm kind of amazed you have.
Yeah, well... maybe it's the hormones.
I don't know; I mean, I know there are a lot more important conversations to be had.
a lot more important conversations being avoided.
you know why I leave here so early?
I want to get behind my desk before anyone else gets in so I don't have to answer any questions.
cause, Lee, I don't know how to answer them.
it's our baby, Lee. And I know we didn't plan it.
I know you didn't bargain for it.
I don't expect you to marry me.
I'm not asking you to do anything, except...
please don't ask me to go into that party looking like this...
by myself.
anyway, you think about it.
see? This whole side of my mouth is, like, dead.
still can't feel a thing.
I think the dentist might have drilled into your brain by accident.
all right, Bridge, Marie, come on-- it's almost bedtime.
Marie, what's the matter?
knock, knock.
go away. I'm not home.
what an inscrutable expression.
what has gone through that brain of yours?
I'm frustrated.
well, I could maybe help you with that.
not that kindof frustrated.
I want to know where Meredith Burnes is.
you know, this Meredith woman, you know, she'll show up.
trust me. She's not Jimmy Hoffa.
eventually, they'll find her, they'll find the car.
there'll be some DNA or something in the trunk.
you know, she'll go up the river.
Hey, you know I'm right.
Oh, is that why you came in here?
to harass me with your positivism and your good mood, now that you're getting full nights of uninterrupted sleep?
actually, no-- I came in here to pass along a request.
what kind of request?
well, apparently, it has not gone unnoticed that, uh, you and I no longer share a bed.
and this is incredibly awkward for me, but, uh, it would appear that there's somebody else who would like to sleep with you.
look what I've got.
looks great. I'm really not hungry.
Oh, come on. Just a little bit.
I've added lots of vitamins and healthy stuff to the ice cream.
can't even taste how good it is for you.
go on, sweetheart, just a sip.
they're coming this afternoon to dig a hole for the swimming pool.
Really? When will it be finished?
in a couple of weeks. Just in time for you to get your strength back and pay us a visit.
here, Grandma, you finish it. - No.
Meredith, what on earth is all that about?
Phoebe has a fever, mother.
shouldn't be drinking out of the same glass.
well, she always has a temperature.
you and I are always around her.
so clearly, she's not contagious.
but we love you, Grandma.
we don't want to take any chances with your health.
right?
right.
what? What- What's the matter? You all right?
I suddenly don't feel so good, Grandma.
my stomach always feels worse after I eat.
they pointed to this room, but I wasn't sure if...
you know Mrs. Dubois.
Yes.
Oh, you found your glasses.
Oh, these? No, they're new. The others never did turn up.
well, they're lovely. - Thank you.
please.
so I'm sure you're curious why we called you, asked you to come down here.
well, I was hoping that you'd have some news.
although, I couldn't for the life of me figure out why you, uh, called me and not Jim.
well, actually, there is some news, of a sort.
are you familiar with Mrs. Dubois here?
I know the two of you have spoken, but have you heard about who she is, what she does?
well, I didn't when we first met, but, uh, my husband told me about you this morning.
Allison had a dream last night.
it was about Meredith.
you're kidding. W - Where... did you see her? Where was she?
it wasn't that kind of dream. It was set in the past.
Meredith was in it, you were in it, Phoebe was in it.
Meredith was taking care of her.
you weren't convinced that what she was doing was best for the child.
Louise, the more time and effort we put into investigating where Meredith is, the more we seem to be discovering about who Meredith was.
what she was capable of.
did you... encourage her to get away?
uh, help her in any way? Perhaps give her some money?
I'm... I'm sorry. This meeting is over.
I know how you feel, Louise. I have three daughters of my own.
but you can't protect Meredith forever.
tell me, Mrs. Dubois, what would one of your daughters have to do before you could say, "That's it, I'm done.
I can't protect her anymore.
I'm so sorry I couldn't have been more... help to you both.
interesting schedule you're on.
think I'm quite the night owl last couple of weeks.
so will I be seeing you at my little soiree tomorrow night?
Lynn left me a voice mail.
I know she's gonna be there, but a, uh, certain police detective seems to be playing hard to get.
what can I tell you?
well, you can tell me if you're gonna be there or not.
so if I show up at the last minute, you're not gonna let me in?
you never know.
you guys okay?
no, we're good. It's just, uh, something's come up; I guess we have to deal with.
I have to deal with. Have to figure out how I feel about it.
think I was kind of hoping it'd just go away, but it's not going anywhere.
am I supposed to know what you're talking about?
are you kidding? I'm not sure I know what I'm talking about.
you know the great thing about being alone?
there's no one to let down.
so will I see you there?
if I'm there, you will definitely see me.
she's covering for her. She's absolutely covering for her.
she gave her money, sent her away someplace. I just know it.
at one point, she actually admitted it.
she asked me,"Is there anything one of your daughters could do that would make you turn your back on her?
and you know, when she asked that, I understood.
if it was one of our children...
could you do it? Could you turn her in?
what's going on?
I'm confused.
didn't you say you've been sleeping straight through the night?
Yeah. Why?
well, you just, you just fell asleep right here, right now.
that doesn't make any sense.
maybe I should call that doctor again in the morning.
well, I know our insurance isn't gonna cover it, but I think maybe you should get a second opinion.
must be 115 degrees Fahrenheit out there today.
try not to let it hurt my feelings that you're finally getting around to putting in a pool.
15 years after I leave home.
for a little girl who isn't even really your granddaughter.
you know I'm kidding.
Oh, yes, I know you're kidding.
I can't stay long. What'd you want to talk about?
I want to talk about Phoebe.
I'm worried that she's getting sick all the time.
fevers, stomachaches. I- I spoke to some doctors who find it very puzzling.
I mean, she has a, she has a heart condition, not an immune deficiency.
I don't know what to tell you, Mother.
she's sick. She's sick a lot.
has been as long as I've been taking care of her.
I know, dear. That's why we should get a second opinion.
then run some more tests.
I mean, m- maybe there's something that we can do that will help.
no, I don't think so.
I'm not putting Phoebe through that. I'm not putting Don through that.
Meredith... - I said no, Mother.
Phoebe's not yours, she's mine.
and I'll decide when and if she needs to see more doctors.
is that it? Is that why I came all the way over here?
because I really need to get home now.
it's almost time for Phoebe's lunch.
I'm so sorry, Meredith.
maybe there's something that I could've done when you were a child, but I didn't see it.
what are you talking about, Mother?
maybe your father and I were-were too indulgent.
you were an only child. You were the center of our universe.
and maybe, maybe you were just born this way.
maybe you came into the world...
with something missing.
something... crucially important.
well, at any rate, I am still your mother, and I need to take responsibility for you.
and I need to protect Phoebe.
Phoebe? Why is everything always about Phoebe?
mom... Oh, my God.
something's wrong. What's going on?
now, it's all right. It's all right, sweetheart. Here, just sit here. Just relax.
mom... - It's okay.
mommy, what's happening? - It's all right.
just close your eyes. Close your eyes. I'm here. I'm here.
it's all right. Close your eyes.
I'm right here.
I love you.
the great plays, the great movies, the great books that have been written about family, they would all like you to believe that blood is thicker than water.
but in real life, a broken heart can sometimes make blood run thin...
thank you.
and water run thick.
Mrs. Leaming?
well, good morning.
I hope you don't mind. I tried to ring the bell, but nobody answered.
Oh, no, no, no. That's fine. This is where the action is.
what brings you by here this morning, Mrs. Dubois?
I had another dream last night.
Really?
you were in it. Meredith was in it.
you were serving her iced tea.
I have to tell the district attorney what I know.
I'd rather you didn't.
because she's my daughter.
I couldn't let Phoebe know what Meredith had done to her.
and I couldn't let my son-in-law spend his life blaming himself.
and my husband? No, no, no, no, no.
I just couldn't do it.
I need to protect Phoebe.
this way, Meredith is... just gone.
and everybody misses her, and when they think of her, they think of a loving wife, mother, daughter...
that they believe that she was.
grandma.
f- For what it's worth, I don't...
actually know where the body is. I don't... I don't even know where to find it.
maybe there's not that much to tell my boss after all.
you do what you have to.
I...
excuse me.
could you do me a favor and give these to Mrs. Leaming.
we're about to lay out the steel framing for the swimming pool.
and they were lying at the bottom, in the dirt.
you found these at the bottom of the pool? - Yeah.
Where's your other half?
Oh, doctor's office. He'll be here soon.
you, uh, you see the Leamings-- James, Louise?
Why? Did you think they'd really come here?
no, not really.
not after all their family's been through; not after the grilling we gave Louise yesterday.
still, in all, I feel badly. I feel like I haven't been a very good friend.
sir, I think there's something I need to tell you. Something I discovered today.
excuse me, Allison. Apparently I have an urgent call. I'll be right back.
just.
sir. Will you be dining alone?
why, do I look lonely?
you'll never guess...I got a telephone call from James Leaming. - There's something I really need to tell you about Louise Leaming...
what? - Excuse me? No, you first.
no, no, no, you first. You said you got a call?
I sure did-- from Councilman Leaming and you won't believe it.
they're on their way to the hospital right now.
a heart for Phoebe just became available.
they're flying it in to Phoenix as we speak.
that little girl's going to get a transplant.
that's amazing news. - Yeah.
Jim said that Phoebe's elated, but that Louise, Louise is over the moon.
and what did you want to tell me?
no, no, no, no. No, it's nothing.
Hey, stranger. - Hey, stranger.
okay, so I'll ask. What's new?
I don't know. So what's new with you?
Congratulations!
congratulations, Lynn.
you look great.
congratulations, Lynn.
I'm an ass.
a big ass. My ass.
so what do we do now?
how about we get through this as quick as we can, so we can get home
have all those important conversations that need to be had.
all those important conversations that keep being avoided.
you here with anybody?
you look happy.
I like this new doctor.
Oh, you do?
Yeah, he's one of those old guys-- real wise, really smart.
so what did he say?
you know, he said pretty much the same thing that the first doctor said.
he seemed to feel pretty strongly that I'm sleep deprived.
Yeah, so I told him all about you.
I bet you did.
Yeah, told him everything. You know what he said?
Oh, I can only imagine.
he said that,"If I had a wife like that, I would sleep with her every chance I got.
that doesn't make any sense. - I know, that's what I thought.
so I said,"What about the sleep deprivation?
you know what he said? He said,"That's why God invented naps.
Really? - Really.
I like this new doctor.
so, uh, so what are you saying? You want to come home with me tonight?
maybe sleep together?
Hey, what are you doing here?
happened to be in the neighborhood. Thought I'd bring dinner by.
real dinner, not that microwave stuff.
you just happened to be in the neighborhood, huh?
maybe I didn't think you should be alone tonight.
you remembered.
of course I remembered.
today's the anniversary.
one year ago today, your entire family was slaughtered.
turn it down, Marie.
Marie, damn it.
don't get me wrong, but you seem a little, uh, tightly wound this morning.
Yeah, well, I feel a little tightly wound.
my head is killing me.
that dream keeps rattling around in my head.
al, come on now, we stayed up over an hour talking about that.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen to me.
it was a bad dream, a bad dream about losing your kids, and that's a dream that every parent has at some point.
Yeah, I know, I was there the first time you said it.
then just think about it, Al. Everything you told me about this dream
all the places, all the people-- you said yourself you didn't recognize any of 'em.
okay, so maybe, maybe, don't you think that maybe that just might mean that it wasn't real?
and until you-- wait, hold on
until you see something that is real, that makes it real, that's the way we have to think.
cause we can't start living our lives like this is, this is our last year.
we can't do that to our kids.
Marie, Mom doesn't want you to read the notes until lunchtime.
otherwise, she'd just hand 'em to you with your cereal in the morning.
it's all right, Marie. I'll write you a new note.
Hey, uh, don't forget.
I don't have Dad's car today, so...
I'm going to need a ride to the Art Institute after school.
they're, uh, having dance tryouts for this summer's dance program.
check your bag.
mom, you didn't.
good LUCK WITH YOUR DANCE TRY OUT. I'LL PICK YOU UP RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL.
okay, you do know that I'm 16, right?
I don't think it's going to fit me.
there are some onesies in here, and I think some dresses.
some of the stuff goes all the way back to Ariel, so feel free to toss whatever you don't want.
Oh, my God! Please, don't hurt me.
I beg you, no!
please! Don't!
I don't understand.
I know you're going to kill me.
cause this is more fun.
you need something else?
who sits at this desk?
uh, most of the time, a detective named Luis Ruiz.
but, uh, he's been out on assignment for about two months.
cloak and dagger stuff. I actually have no idea what he's doing. Why?
everything I'm about to tell you is highly classified information.
I'm sure you two have heard about what's going on down in Mexico.
the carnage, it's...
like nothing they've ever seen before.
gunfights in the streets, wholesale murder, body count's well into the thousands.
it's a drug war.
two rival cartels are fighting over territories and distribution.
and now, some of that fighting is spilling over the border.
seen a rash of kidnappings and homicides across Arizona that we believe is connected to what's going on down south.
Allison, that detective that you think might be in danger, he's actually been working undercover as a part of a joint investigation between us and the Drug Enforcement Agency.
miraculously, he's managed to get inside one of the cartel's operations right here in Phoenix.
no law enforcement agency has ever had a man in so deep with one of these organizations.
well, that's great. When's the last time anyone actually heard from him?
well, when a man is working that deep undercover, he can't be expected to check in with any regularity...
now that man that you saw torturing him...
Yeah, the one with the burn scar on his face.
Oh, my God. This is him.
I was afraid of that. Oswaldo Castillo.
he's, uh, he's been the cartel's top enforcer for years.
now, he specializes in the assassination of Mexican politicians and judges.
we've suspected for a long while that the cartel has stationed him here in Arizona.
but, um, no one's been able to lay eyes on him.
his presence here would certainly explain this rash of violence.
Hey, you.
okay, I'll ask.
why are you looking at me like that?
Allison, everybody's been trying to reach you for two hours.
3: 00, Ariel?
dance tryouts?
art Institute?
Oh, my God, I...
I was supposed to go get her.
I completely forgot.
it's okay. She called me.
I postponed a conference call and I got her there.
I don't understand. How could she not get ahold of me?
well, she called your office and they said you were behind closed doors.
and we both tried your cell, and it just went straight to voice mail.
I don't even remember turning this off.
Oh, God...
al, you okay?
Yeah, it's nothing, I just have this headache and I just can't seem to shake it.
do you want me to call Dr. Berman, see if he can squeeze you in first thing in the morning?
Joe, It's a headache.
I know, but I'm leaving for San Diego tomorrow, so if you're coming down with something...
I'm not coming down with something; it's a headache. It'll pass.
promise you.
you know, I can, I can make it through three days without you.
if you really want to help me, why don't you get the girls dinner and put them to bed, so I can just crawl under the covers and try to sleep this thing off?
okay, go ahead. Crawl away.
by the way, she got in.
she nailed the tryout.
excellent.
sorry I'm late.
that's okay.
you said it was important.
I think I might have found someone who knows where he is.
who?
his doctor.
his name's Hector Cruz. He's in Guadalajara, Mexico.
wait a second. Where'd you come up with this?
I hired another private detective.
you're telling me you hired another private eye to hunt for Oswaldo Castillo after the last one took all your money and disappeared?
do you not understand that I do this for a living?
well, according to him, this Cruz is some kind of mob doctor.
he treats wounded cartel soldiers after-hours in his clinic.
if we could just get in there, if we could get into his files.
he's got to have some kind of a way to contact his patients.
not necessarily, if in fact, he's even really Castillo's doctor.
if in fact, he's even gone to see him in the last year.
or ten years or whatever.
not to mention the fact that you're talking about Mexico.
I have no jurisdiction in Mexico. You know that.
and even if I did, we don't know that any of this is true.
I'm sorry.
the best I can do is to pass this doctor's name along to the Mexican authorities.
that's the best you can do?
look into his eyes and you tell me that you give a damn about jurisdiction.
look at him!
this is the man who murdered your wife.
this is the man who massacred my family!
No!
Hello?
no, you didn't wake me. It's only 8: 30.
Yes, Mr. District Attorney.
wherever you need me to go.
what am I looking at?
do you remember the police officer who was working undercover?
the one you were so concerned about?
that's him.
in the coolers in about a dozen pieces.
this is, uh, this is his house.
Oh, my God, that poor woman.
unfortunately, this is pretty standard stuff for these cartels.
targeting the families of their enemies, of law enforcement agents.
makes people think twice about investigating them.
the DEA's going to be setting up a task force in our offices until this is solved.
if it's all right with you,
I'd like to introduce you to my colleague on the federal side.
he is the guy who's going to be running their whole show.
believe it or not, he lost his wife to a cartel car bomb just a few weeks ago.
they murdered his wife?
agent Munoz.
special Agent Daniel Munoz,
I'd like you to meet Allison Dubois.
Daniel Munoz-- that's his name, Special Agent Daniel Munoz.
he's completely real.
I know, I hear you, I hear you, I hear you.
he's real, Joe. I didn't make him up.
he worked for the DEA.
not only that, they murdered his wife.
Who-who murdered this guy's wife?
he did it with a car bomb.
he's a professional killer.
he works for this drug cartel.
he's the one that I saw torturing that detective.
this is it-- this is what he does.
he kills people. He kills people's families.
well, say something.
and we're next, right? Me and the kids, we're next?
that's where you're going, right?
why do you say this like it's a question?
I'm sorry, Allison, I don't know how to continue this conversation unless it's a question.
how do you want me to continue? Like it's a certainty
my death, my children's deaths, they're absolutely certain?
well, hey, let's just go get the cyanide and end it all right now.
what the hell do you want me to do, Allison? Come on.
isn't it enough that my life is over, but now you're upset with me because I'm not reacting to it properly? What is it you want me to do?
what is it I want you to do?
what is it I want you to do?!
I want you to get your ass out of that damn bed, and I want you to keep us safe!
I want you to act like you give a damn!
like what I'm saying matters to you!
of course it matters to me,
it completely matters.
but I don't know what to tell you to do about it if you're already convinced that doing anything is useless.
and I don't think that waking the kids by yelling at each other is the answer either.
there were five ice chests.
each with a different piece of that police detective in it.
I understand.
and I believe you, I do
I absolutely believe you.
but I also believe that standing out in the sun too long is going to give me cancer, but I'll be damned if the kids and I are are going to spend the rest of our lives hiding in the dark.
what kind of an answer is that?
that's the only answer I have, Allison.
I can't believe that our fate is sealed, I can't.
life is about choices. You've just got to make the right ones.
well, what are they?
okay, let's say you're right.
let's say that we're a target for these cartel people because you work in law enforcement, okay?
then the answer's pretty simple.
you got to stop working in law enforcement.
you're right. - Of course I'm right.
I got to quit.
I mean, I know Devalos is counting on me, but I have to quit, and I have to make sure that they know that I did.
that's right, for the sake of your family, that's what you have to do, absolutely.
I mean, there's no other choice, is there?
I mean, if you're convinced that we're in danger, if you're absolutely certain of it, no, yeah, you-you got to go into work tomorrow, you got to knock on Devalos' door and you got to say, "I resign
for the safety of my family.
of course, if you're convinced that we're all going to die anyway, what's the point?
which is why the choice that I would advocate involves two things.
first, that you embrace the possibility that these things that you're dreaming about might not be set in stone.
and secondly, secondly, that you do your job, you do your job as if your life depended on it.
as if your family's life depended on it.
and then-then you might be able to find this guy, this...
Oswaldo Castillo. You find him and you put him away.
you put the people that he works for away.
and then, there's no reason for anyone to kill your family anymore.
and there's no one left around to do it.
you sleep here?
it's Allison, right?
well, I'm impressed, Allison.
none of my agents ever beat me into the office.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
don't be.
my wife's murder is part of this case.
so is this how it works? Your thing
you look at a file, hope something comes to you?
to be perfectly honest, I have no idea how this thing works.
or even if it's going to work on any given day.
but, uh...
Yeah, sometimes looking at pictures, at a file
sometimes it helps.
please, I want to show you something.
this is everything we've got.
had it expressed over from my El Paso field office last night.
look at whatever you like. My files are your files.
Ariel, come on, hurry up.
taxi's here to take me to the airport.
the girls are going to be late for school if you don't leave soon.
I'm on it, Dad. Don't worry.
Marie's doing it again.
Marie, you're supposed to wait until lunchtime to read Mommy's messages.
Hey, come on, it's all right. She doesn't have to wait if she doesn't want to.
come on, come on, you guys got to get going.
daddy, I can't read this. Could you please read it to me?
Marie, have a...
let me see yours, sweetie, can I...?
there.
killed 3/10/08
Hi. Is this 220 Dekalb?
I couldn't find any number on your house.
Thanks.
tu almuerzo.
I think I know where we can find him.
I think I know where Oswaldo Castillo's hiding.
Allison, you don't look well.
maybe you and I should go talk about this outside.
no, no. I saw him.
I just saw Oswaldo Castillo.
he's at 220 Dekalb.
he's at an old lady's house.
I think her son was a friend of his.
why are you all just sitting there?
Allison, your nose.
Mrs. Dubois.
Dr. Cruz.
sorry to keep you waiting, huh?
not at all, Doctor. Thanks for squeezing me in.
please...
be patient with me. My English is a little weak.
we don't get too many tourists from your country in these parts of Guadalajara.
it says that you were hoping to get a prescription today?
for pain medication?
according to this, you are still experiencing some pain from a surgery that you had a year ago?
a brain surgery.
I had a tumor growing on my brain stem.
usually I would just contact my own doctor for the pills, but since I wasn't planning on being back in the States for a few days...
you thought you would visit my humble clinic, huh?
you do realize, Mrs. Dubois, you are not the first American to cross the border in search of narcotic pain medication.
I don't suppose you would have some documentation of your surgery.
a MRI perhaps.
thank you, Doctor.
I understand.
I was just hoping not to cut my vacation short, but actually I feel like I got everything I wanted.
Mrs. Dubois, do you mind letting me see your scar?
pardon me?
your scar.
I mean, if you did undergo the procedure you are describing to me, it should not be a problem.
who knows? It might convince me to give you the prescription you are after.
for the right price, of course.
Allison, hey, hey, Allison, hey.
you're awake.
how you feeling? You okay?
my head hurts.
how long have I been here?
just a few hours. Listen, Al, um, they ran some tests while you were unconscious.
and I need to talk to you about what they found.
the brain tumor. I know.
as you can see, you have a sizable tumor growing in the region of the medulla.
the medulla's part of the brain stem. It regulates motor functions, breathing, heartbeat, R. E.M. sleep.
the medulla's in charge of all of that.
these headaches you've been having?
they're a symptom of your condition.
as the tumor grows, there's less space in your skull for your brain.
and that can cause something called elevated intracranial pressure.
and that can lead to all kinds of side effects, including difficulty understanding and expressing language.
which might explain the garbled notes you told me about.
so this tumor, this thing inside of her brain, are we talking cancer?
we have no way of knowing until we examine the tissue.
and we can't do that without performing a surgical procedure.
a procedure that we need to do in any event to remove the tumor and relieve the pressure on the brain.
no, the tumor is benign. I already know that.
that's good, Mrs. Dubois. It's important to think positively.
no, you don't understand.
I know it's benign.
I heard you, Mrs. Dubois.
and I'm aware of your reputation.
but even if you're right, it changes nothing.
we need to get in there.
the tumor is growing quickly.
if we do not do something soon, very soon, it can lead to something we call "herniation of the brain.
and that can cause paralysis, coma... and even death.
it's okay.
none of those things are gonna happen to me.
when do we do this?
as soon as possible.
I'd like to schedule it for tomorrow morning.
you want to open up my skull tomorrow morning?
okay, I'm fine with that.
that's excellent.
girls will be getting out of school soon.
I want to bring them here so we that can tell them both together.
no. - What?
I want you to take the girls and get out of Phoenix.
I don't care where you guys go, just stay away.
what are you talking about?
you are in danger, Joe.
you, the girls.
everything I've been dreaming lately, it's all coming true.
and I know if you and the girls stay here, you're gonna die.
Allison... you're ill.
Yeah, now, but in the future, in the future, I am better.
I survive all this.
No! This is serious, Al.
you have a brain tumor!
you're asking me on the eve of a surgery that you might not survive, to-to pack up our kids and take them as far away as I possibly can? No!
I'm not listening to your dreams, not this time.
No! - Yes!
Hey, look at this!
take a good, long look 'cause this is what that tumor's doing to you when you try to write.
now imagine what it is doing to you when you try to dream.
I don't care! - No!
your dreams cannot be trusted right now. No.
hey... what if I'm right?
I know I'm sick.
and I know you're worried about me.
but please, I beg of you, please?
I don't want to survive this if I can't have my family.
okay. All right.
okay, fine. You win.
okay, I'll go home. I'll take them to my sister's.
I'll tell them we want them to stay there so that I can stay here in the hospital with you.
No! That is the best that I can do.
because I need to be here when you wake up in the morning.
and I need to be here every morning until you're better.
and that is just the way that it's gonna be.
I, uh, I heard about your illness. I'm so sorry.
I won't stay long.
I just wanted to let you know that we went to that address you gave us.
found a bunch of weapons hidden on the property, men's clothes, some fake I. D.s that belonged to Oswald Castillo.
but not him?
not him.
we must have just missed him.
he must have known we were coming because he left in a hurry.
left behind his money, his weapons.
this is a good thing.
we will find him.
I wish I could believe you.
I've dreamt about him, you know.
he wants to hurt my family.
I don't know when, I don't know where...
but it's coming.
ma'am, I know we don't know each other very well, but...
today you very nearly led me to the man who murdered my wife.
these things you've been seeing?
I'm not gonna let 'em happen.
you're not gonna let them happen.
that's why we're here.
that's why we're in this together.
good luck, Allison.
sir, what are you doing here?
I got the voicemail message you left me this afternoon.
and you said some very nice things, Allison, but I have to admit the message alarmed me.
all that talk about how glad you are to have known me.
how appreciative you are of everything I've done for you.
to be honest, Allison, it sounded like a good-bye.
I was just depressed.
I guess I just called to say hi.
I got your voicemail and I just...
talked too much. I'm sorry.
can I come in?
Oh, sure.
you know, I know we've been out of touch for a while, but I still consider you a friend, and it's...
listen, I just have to ask you this.
you're not considering doing anything drastic, are you?
No! No, I'm fine.
I mean, some days are better than others, but...
no, I'm not planning on doing anything drastic.
please.
you, uh...
you going somewhere?
I'm just going out of town for a couple days.
I see.
can you put it off?
what for?
because I'd like you to come to work for me again starting right now.
what would I do? I haven't had a dream in a year.
I don't care.
I'll hire you right now as a paralegal.
you go back to school. You finish getting your law degree.
look, as long as I have a job, you have a job.
I don't think so.
you have got to move on. You owe it to the memory of your family.
I owe it to the memory of my family to do what I'm doing now.
I could have saved them...
Joe and the girls.
before that operation...
I was dreaming about Castillo.
I was on the path to finding him.
and I would have found him, I know it.
but after that surgery, when I woke up, it was just gone.
no more visions, no more dreams.
it was like when they cut that tumor out, they cut out my gift, too.
if I'd just put off that surgery, my family would still be alive.
Hey. I'm back.
it's good that you're up. The nurse said that they're gonna take you in for surgery in ten minutes, so I brought you some stuff from home.
the girls all wrote you notes.
on paper napkins. They're hidden in here.
um, I wasn't supposed to tell you.
what's the matter, cat got your tongue?
Hello? - Where the hell are you?
it's... It's okay, Joe. Really, it's going to be okay.
no, it is not okay.
you ripped out your IV and you snuck out of your hospital room.
you're supposed to be in surgery right now. - Yeah, I know. I can't have that surgery.
what did you say?
I can't have it. At least not now.
it's going to take away my dreams, Joe.
it's going to take away my gift.
Allison, what the hell are you talking about?
look, I had another dream last night about the future.
and now...
and now I know that if I let them operate, it's going to be the last dream that I ever have.
Allison, you're delirious.
you're not making any sense.
I need to keep dreaming.
I need to find out how I'm supposed to save you.
after that, I swear, I will come back to the hospital.
I will come back to you.
with any luck, it'll just be a couple of days.
you could be dead in a couple of days.
tell Lee.
t-tell Lee that he shouldn't bother checking my credit cards because I just used the cash that I have in my purse.
I found a nice place to dream.
no, no, no, no. Allison. Allison, listen to me. Listen.
I love you, Joe.
whatever happens, you know that.
I love you more than anything.
I heard about your close call in Guadalajara.
didn't expect to see you back in the States so soon.
what can I say? I had a very good doctor.
there's an extra $20, 000 here.
cabrera family.
they want to make sure you know they appreciate the level of cooperation that you offer them.
what is that?
the garage door.
who are you?
what are you doing here?
her name's Allison Dubois.
you killed her family a little over a year ago.
doctor's office in Guadalajara.
you went there on your own, didn't you?
you left a cell number with the doctor.
he needed to contact you to give you the results of a blood test, see if your gunshot wound had gone septic.
the investigator I hired tracked the cell number this address.
that's how I got here.
now, what are you doing here, Daniel?
well, I guess we know.
all right, that's enough talk.
wait a second. What's that smell?
don't worry about it. Pull the trigger.
we can all go together.
I cut the gas line before I closed the garage door.
I figure, by now, all it will take is one little spark.
you pull your trigger. I'll pull mine.
any spark will do.
explain to me how you can take money from these people after they did that to your wife.
Oh, see? You're not so psychic.
he didn't start taking money after I killed his bride.
he was taking money for years.
you allowed them to murder her?
she figured out what I was doing.
I didn't like it, but...
Hey, the past is the past.
point is, nobody has to die now.
we can all walk away.
and you can walk away a very wealthy woman, Miss Dubois.
I don't want that.
I don't want money.
I want to see my family again.
and we all know there's only one way that I can do that now.
so, what is it going to be?
you're right.
ladies first.
agent Munoz. You're here.
Mr. District Attorney.
it's awfully early in the morning to be seeing you. Something up?
well, we just received an anonymous tip.
a citizen spotted someone matching Oswaldo Castillo's description.
apparently, he's meeting with two other men in a parking lot outside a check cashing facility in Point Breeze.
right now?
we believe so. Squad cars are on the way. You can ride with me if you'd like.
sure. Let me just stick this in here and I'll be right down.
cops ON WAY. LEAVE NOW.
did you warn him?
Allison, my God.
I thought you were having surgery this morning. What are you doing here?
I had to put it off.
I had to tell the District Attorney about a...
dream that I just had.
what are you talking about? Allison, no offense, but you look terrible. I don't think you know what you're saying.
sir! You can come in now.
what's going on? I thought we were going after Castillo.
there was no tip. We just told you that so you would be compelled to contact Oswaldo.
may I see your phone, please?
absolutely not. This is my private phone. I just can't...
that cop you gave up, Luis Ruiz.
he sat five feet from me for the past three years.
I know his kid.
give me that phone now or I'll arrest you for obstruction of justice and then I'll take it from you.
this is insane.
I'm a Federal Agent. You just can't bully me.
that really doesn't matter much, Agent Munoz.
either you give me the phone or I go to the trouble of getting a subpoena and getting the records from your carrier.
they'll give me every call, every text, and as I'm sure you're aware, all I need to do is prove that you forwarded information about Detective Ruiz to the Cabrera cartel.
and that would make you an accessory to the murder of a police officer.
you'd be looking at the death penalty.
or you can give me your phone.
tell me where Oswaldo Castillo's hiding, and I might just be willing to settle for putting you in jail for the rest of your life.
okay. We did it your way.
now let's get you to the hospital.
paging Dr. Stateman. Dr. Stateman, please.
Hey. Joe.
any news?
I haven't heard a thing. She's still in surgery.
well, I would have been here sooner, but your wife left me a very busy man.
gave us the address where Oswaldo Castillo was hiding.
we arrested him about two hours ago.
Joe, I know that Allison delayed her surgery because she was afraid that the cartel posed a threat to your family.
you should know that they're not a threat anymore.
you're wife's a hero, Joe.
I know that.
I've always known that.
Mr. Dubois.
maybe we should speak in my office.
no. What's going on. Just...
tell me. How's my wife?
the procedure itself went well.
the tumor was benign.
and we were able to excise it almost entirely.
there was a small portion that had grown deeply into the tissue of the brainstem.
if it continues to grow, we think we'll be able to eliminate it with radiation.
that's... Okay.
so, how long before she's awake?
your wife had a stroke shortly before surgery.
the pressure in her skull, it just got to be too much.
we went ahead with the procedure anyway.
but now she is completely non-responsive and she's showing no signs of consciousness.
and so far, we've been unable to wake her.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dubois.
but until we can determine the severity of the stroke, it is impossible to predict when or even if she will ever come out of her comatose state.
I don't understand it.
summer used to love that cat.
now she never even plays with him.
she never plays with anything.
I'm afraid that your daughter's increasing lack of affect
is all part of her ongoing withdrawal from the world.
I don't know what that means-- "withdrawal from the world.
is she going through some kind of depression?
can a 12-year-old even be depressed?
doctor, I need someone to tell me what's going on with my daughter.
your daughter's having delusions, hallucinations.
she's displaying something that we call "disorganized speech.
and while I'm not about to diagnosis her from across the room,
I will tell you that these are all classic symptoms of early onset paranoid schizophrenia.
schizophrenia?
it's clear to me that she's very, very sick.
I'm sorry, you're just wrong.
she's not sick.
she's just going through something.
Oh, god.
summer, what have you done?!
he wouldn't stop talking to me.
that I don't even think I'm offended.
Yeah, what's wrong with it?
I think it's pretty good.
well, first of all, I'm not a cheerleader.
and second of all, I don't have buckteeth.
and third of all, I don't walk around saying,"I'm ariel, I'm ariel!
but other than that, I think you, uh, you nailed it.
it's a caricature.
it's not supposed to look exactly like you.
it's supposed to tell the truth about what you're like inside.
and you're right, I think I nailed it.
good morning, all.
wow, Bridge, you did all those?
looks like you've been really busy.
why the sudden interest in art?
please, Bridgette's not interested in art.
Bridgette is interested in Finn who is interested in art.
Hey!
Oh, yeah? Who's this Finn?
Bridgette's boyfriend.
he is not.
he's not.
he's just a friend that happens to be a boy.
and, uh, it's not the same thing.
okay. All right, if you say so.
does mom know about this?
well, I was going to mention it to her this morning,
but she got up and went to work Before I got up, So I didn't get to.
thank you.
well, I'm here, and I'm all ears.
so tell me a little bit more about this friend who happens to be a boy.
he's really nice.
and he sits in front of me in math class.
he's into a lot of the same really cool stuff that I am.
he's really nice to me, too.
he plays with me and Bridgette on the playground.
hmm, okay, I got it.
Finn is cool.
Finn is nice.
come on, dishes into the sink.
we're leaving in five minutes.
see you later.
okay, see you later.
later, pop. - Later.
morning, Keelin. - Morning, Keelin.
did you sleep well? - Did you sleep well?
do you think maybe this morning you could try to answer my questions
instead of repeating them?
any idea how this girl was able to break out of this facility?
I mean, I know the name is mariposa psychiatric hospital,
but it is part of the prison system.
based on that tape, That girls doesn't seem terribly aggressive.
to be honest, I'm a little flummoxed. I think we both are.
well, obviously, we have a security presence here at mariposa psych,
but in the wing where Keelin resides it's fairly benign.
those patients are all approaching the age of majority.
they're within a year of being released.
so as part of their treatment, they're afforded much more freedom than the other wings enjoy.
and the vast majority of our patients are minors, So we see very few attempted escapes.
I know that's not much help.
so, uh, who are we looking for?
what can you tell us about her, other than the fact that she repeats whatever anybody tells her?
well, her full name is Keelin Mckinney.
and three years ago, right before her 15th birthday,
she had an affair with her history teacher.
and about five months into it, the history teacher broke it off.
a week later, she follows him home, ties him up in his bed
and shoots him 12 times with her father's pistol.
the police arrive.
she's just sitting there, unresponsive, and she slipped into a catatonic state.
and, finally, two months ago, she came out of it.
so that parroting that you saw on the video-- that's called echolalia.
we almost always encounter it when catatonic patients awaken.
but having said that,
I've never seen the phenomena present itself in quite the way it has with Keelin.
the depth of her recall is extraordinary.
sometimes she spends whole therapy sessions parroting the previous session.
or... She did.
I don't understand. All she could do was repeat back what people said to her,
and yet she's within a year of her release?
she was sentenced as a minor.
she's about to turn 18.
and strange as it seems, the echolalia-- that's progress.
after three years of total silence, It's Keelin's way of coming back into the world.
and you have no idea how she was able to get out?
maybe she snuck in the back of a delivery truck. Hitched a ride out.
maybe someone left a wrong door open.
none of the orderlies or the guards are willing to admit
they know anything about what happened.
I think they're afraid for their jobs.
but I'm hoping they'll be more cooperative when policemen are asking the questions.
I'd be happy to talk to them and take a look around.
Dr. Woodel, this girl Keelin, what's your feeling?
do you think she's dangerous?
I'd like to say no.
that I'm confident that my work with her has cured her of those impulses,
but I obviously misjudged Keelin.
we all did.
so I can't answer that for sure.
so where do we start?
I thought maybe you could check out the girl's room while I walk the grounds.
it's right upstairs, room 306.
maybe something will come to you, you know?
he wouldn't stop talking to me.
you here about Keelin?
I can make myself scarce, if you need some time to look around.
no, no, no, I was just leaving.
I'm Allison; I'm Allison Dubois.
I'm with the district attorney's office.
you folks making any progress?
have any idea where she is?
no, no, not yet.
poor keelin-- she must be terrified.
why do you say that?
I mean, she did run away.
and the police seem to think she might be dangerous.
dangerous?
they haven't met her.
I know what she did and all, but that was a long time ago.
Keelin was the sweetest person in here.
she was my friend.
crazy, right?
how can you be friends with someone who hardly ever talks?
well, the thought did cross my mind.
we actually talked all the time.
at least, I talked to her.
and she liked it, I could tell.
believe it or not, I think it was helping her get better.
and she helped me, too.
don't tell dr. Woodel, but, you know, Sometimes I liked talking to Keelin more than I like talking to him.
summer, it's time for group.
well, I have to go. But look at whatever you'd like. It was nice meeting you.
nice to meet you, summer.
well, I don't know what kind of work you're doing around here,
but it certainly seems to be working for her.
Yeah, summer's definitely come a long way.
her parents must be so relieved.
Oh, you don't know?
summer's parents are the reason that she's here.
when she was 13, right about the time they began to suspect that she was ill,
summer snuck into their room while they were sleeping and she stabbed them to death.
Bridgette Dubois, do you have an answer for me?
I'm waiting.
okay... - Okay, what?
I see you furiously scribbling in your notebook.
I can only assume you figured out what x is.
um, let me see.
any time now, Bridgette.
very good, Bridgette.
I'm glad to see you were paying attention.
thank you.
I owe you one.
Yeah, it's okay.
I just hope you were spaced out 'cause you were working on another cartoon.
Mr. Marcotullio this time.
I think I nailed him.
aren't you going to let me see it?
Nope. Not good enough. It's not ready.
it's okay.
show it to me when you're ready.
if I survive gym class, I'll see you and Marie at lunch, okay?
Yeah, sure. - See you then.
okay. - Okay.
Keelin, I'd like to change the subject. - Keelin, I'd like to change the subject.
let's talk about your parents. - Let's talk about your parents.
do you ever think about your childhood? - Do you ever think about your childhood?
your relationship with your mom and dad? - Your relationship with your mom and dad?
this is that girl-- Keelin Mckinney
the one who went missing from mariposa psych last night.
Yeah, I have to say I'm impressed.
if that girl recovered enough to run away from a psychiatric hospital,
her doctor's a miracle worker.
you know, I met another one of his patients today.
a girl named Summer.
she murdered her parents six years ago.
you wouldn't believe how far she's come.
I mean, she seems like she could have been one of Ariel's friends.
but here's the thing that I don't get: She killed her parents.
she slaughtered them in their beds.
the memory of that's got to be in there somewhere, doesn't it?
how can she live with that?
how could she function?
don't look at me, I have no idea.
I can barely function myself, and I haven't slaughtered anybody.
not lately.
sweetie, what are you doing here?
911. What's the nature of your emergency?
I need the police right away and an ambulance!
I think they're dead! Oh, my god, I think she killed them!
sir, please calm down. We'll get a car right out to you.
who is dead?
Myparents. She killed them. She finally snapped.
my sister went crazy and killed my parents!
Oh, that's pretty.
I love impatiens.
Thanks.
they've been letting me take care of the garden for a few years now.
you're here with Keelin news, right?
good news, right?
no news, I'm sorry to say.
actually, I was wanting to talk to you about something else.
I know why you're here.
I know what happened.
I'm curious. How much do you actually remember from that night?
I remember everything. And I wish I didn't.
honestly, I don't really like to think about it that much, Mrs. Dubois.
I was a very different person back then.
I was very confused.
I had convinced myself that my parents were imposters.
that evil people had replaced them and were trying to do bad things to me and my brother.
actually, I wanted to talk to you about your brother.
what about him?
well, it's like you said-- You were a very different person then.
you were confused.
I'm just wondering if you could think back, think back.
do you remember actually seeing your brother that night?
where are you going with this?
do you know how long I've been here?
do you know how hard I've worked to get to the place where I am?
I mean, how crazy do you think I am?
the night you're talking about, has been cauterized in my memory.
and you're implying that the only living relative that I have left may have been a part of it?
and that maybe I don't remember?
Mrs. Dubois, on your way out today you might seriously consider trading in your visitor's badge for a room assignment.
did you see Marie?
she's out there somewhere. She'll be along in a minute.
Hey, can I ask you a question?
you just did. - Never mind.
okay, I'm sorry. What?
when you like a guy, how do you know it?
wait-- who likes a boy?
I'm thinking maybe I do.
you know, it's sixth grade.
boys just can't be friends with girls anymore, And girls just can't be friends with boys.
and everyone's starting to like someone, like-- "like," like.
it's weird. I didn't think I was into any of this stuff, but then... I drew this.
Wow.
I, um... I guess you might really like this guy.
Really?
cause I don't feel any different.
and the weirdest thing is, I don't even remember writing it down.
I mean, I just looked down and there it was.
Yeah, liking guys can make us do some really strange stuff.
so how do I make it stop?
you like this guy.
and you can't turn that off.
so maybe you should try hanging out with him.
see if maybe he feels the same way.
well, what do you mean? I'm already hanging out with him.
I know, but now that you like him, it's gonna be different.
different how?
I can't explain.
but it's um, it's gonna be different.
so I have to keep doing what I'm already doing,
except now it's different in some way that you can't explain to me?
Yeah.
I'm never going to get rid of this, am I?
of course I remember Summer Lowry.
I handled the plea bargain that led to her committal.
and I was present when she confessed to the killing of her parents.
look...
you and I have far too much history together for me to just dismiss out of hand Something you've dreamt, but there is precious little to suggest that anybody got anything wrong in this particular case.
at the time of her committal, Summer Lowry was a deeply disturbed young woman.
and she had a very well documented history of violent behavior.
and she confessed to the crime.
her brother Chad, on the other hand, was an honor student, he was grief stricken, and no one who knew him, even for just a minute,
entertained the idea that he might have been involved.
well, I know it sounds like it's from left field, But there was nothing vague about what I saw.
it was completely unambiguous.
he committed the killings, and she was nowhere in sight.
be that as it may, unless you have some evidence that you haven't shown me yet
something to prove that what you've seen is true-- There's nothing I can do, Allison.
hello.
you want some good news or bad news?
Lee... - Good or bad, you gotta call it.
all right, good, give me the good.
and you better not disappoint.
you know that girl who escaped from mariposa psych, Keelin Mckinney?
I'm hot on her trail.
turns out she paid a visit to her shrink last night.
you're right, that is excellent news.
but what's the bad?
Dr. Woodel left the windows in his house unlocked.
we think that's how she got in.
the housekeeper found him around noon.
he was lying in bed, his wrists tied to the headboard stabbed to death with a knife from his own kitchen.
the whole scene was littered with Keelin's hair and fingerprints.
I just don't understand.
why would she kill her therapist?
well, we're talking about an escaped mental patient.
this girl was committed because she got obsessed With her teacher, before she killed him.
maybe she got obsessed with this guy, too.
anyway, we know who did it. Now we just have to find her.
girls, come on, what are you doing back there? Dinner's ready.
Wow! Wow, look at you. You look so pretty. What is this all about?
we're giving my face a test run. I'm going over to Finn's house on Saturday, to watch a movie.
well, I think the test is going quite well.
Thanks.
how about some dinner?
makeup?
Bridgette is wearing makeup?
our Bridgette?
help me out here. Wasn't she just born?
didn't we just bring her home from the hospital?
I'm sorry, daddy.
your little girl likes a little boy.
I know she can't spend her whole life as a conscientious objector in the war between the sexes,
but doesn't this seem-- I don't know, fast?
this doesn't alarm you?
our middle daughter-- boys?
Hey, I'm a reformed boy myself.
and let me tell you something-- If you're not worried, you ought to be.
come on, it's cute.
besides, there's nothing we can do about it.
and there's nothing reformed about you.
no, please. Why are you doing this?
doctor, come on, I think we both know damn well why I'm doing this.
no, I don't. You can just let me go.
untie me, walk away.
please, I won't tell anybody what I know.
I certainly won't tell them that you killed your parents.
of course you'd say that now,
but you weren't exactly reassuring when you came to see me a few weeks ago.
back then it was,"give me half of everything you've got or I'm going to the police.
you even got that tape with her talking about it all.
but I don't want any more money, now, Chad.
I'll give you those tapes.
no one will ever know better.
you're right about that much.
stop.
you can't just kill me.
think it through, Chad.
they'll catch you.
you don't have some poor sick girl to pin it on this time.
actually, I do.
but this time her name isn't Summer... ...It's Keelin.
you are going to tell me where those tapes are,
in which case, Keelin's going to kill you nice and quick,
or you're going to put up a fight, which means Keelin's going to take her time.
kill the parents, He's killed this girl Keelin Mckinney
and he killed Keelin Mckinney's psychiatrist?
well, think about it. He had to.
Dr. Woodel knew that Chad was the real killer.
and he was in the process of blackmailing Chad.
I'm sorry.
okay, all right, let's assume that you are correct about all of this.
the blackmail, everything.
that Summer confessed the truth to her psychiatrist and he used it to blackmail the brother.
how in the hell did Chad Lowry come into possession of Keelin Mckinney's hand?
I know, I know, He sawed it off her arm after he killed her.
there's an apb out on this girl.
every policeman in the city is looking for her.
do you seriously think that Chad Lowry tracked her down before the police could?
what if he didn't have to track her down? What if she came to him?
I mean, he visits his sister every week in the hospital.
they probably know each other.
what if she came to him for help?
I don't know what to tell you, Allison.
the Lowry murder is a closed case.
the murderer confessed, and even she doesn't dispute what happened.
the killing of the psychiatrist seems pretty open and shut, as well.
I would love to show you some support in all of this,
but if the guilty party insists they're guilty...
that's okay. You know what, I know what I have to do.
I have to go back to mariposa psych.
summer Lowry knows what happened the night her parents died.
she obviously told her psychiatrist.
she can tell me, too.
summer, it's Allison.
summer, I know you're in there.
the front desk called you and let you know I was coming.
please open the door.
summer, I'm coming in.
I know you're upset.
we're all upset.
and obviously, I didn't know dr. Woodel as well as you did, but...
they said that Keelin did it.
I can't believe that.
do you believe that?
I-I know she killed that other man, but...
I'll tell you what I think. I will tell you exactly what I think.
but first, Summer, you have to be honest with me.
you have to tell me what you know.
what are you talking about?
you know what I'm talking about.
I think the same person who killed dr. Woodel killed your parents.
but that doesn't make any sense.
that makes perfect sense.
what makes no sense is you protecting him.
I mean, I know he's your brother, But what is it?
is he threatening you?
Summer-- I think he killed Keelin, too.
no.
he's doing the same thing to her that he did to you
trying to get everyone to believe that she's a murderer.
you said she was your friend.
don't you think you should come forward for her?
if it's your safety you're worried about, We can, we can protect you.
I can't.
I can't. - Yes, you can.
just tell me you will.
I can't! I can't!
okay. Okay, okay.
just-just think about what I said.
and I'll call you on the phone and we can talk about it tonight, okay?
can I come in?
go away. I'm busy.
I need you to look at something.
I told you I'm busy.
look at these two books.
okay, I'm looking. So what am I supposed to see?
you remember that, right?
Yes.
okay, now look at this.
okay.
you filled another notebook.
you should be careful. Finn might think you're a stalker.
that's not my notebook, that's Marie's.
and she's got this book filled with this stuff.
pages and pages.
and I think she's been doing it a while.
so what's your point?
my point is, I think that the reason that I don't remember doing it, is because I didn't do it.
I think this page belongs to Marie and somehow ended up in my book.
I think she's the one who's in love with Finn-- not me.
wait a minute, Bridge, just because you didn't write his name a hundred times on a piece of paper,
does not mean that you don't like him.
Hey, say something. You're scaring me.
I don't know what to say, okay? I'm just upset.
what are you upset about?
I mean, first you tell me that you don't like the way it feels to like a boy,
and then when it turns out that maybe you don't like him you get upset.
so, Bridgette, make up your mind.
I did make up my mind.
and I know what I said.
I know that I said that liking a boy felt weird.
then it started to make me feel, I don't know, normal for once.
Bridgette, well, then-then maybe you do like him.
no.
this is Marie's, not mine.
Finn's not mine either.
what do you mean she won't speak with me?
I was there today.
we had a plan to speak tonight.
are you sure you have the right patient-- Summer Lowry?
my name is Dubois. Allison Dubois.
but can you just check again? It's really important.
she won't speak with me. They said she won't take my call.
no, I understand.
um... Can you just do me a favor?
make sure she's got my number and let her know if she changes her mind,
that I'll be here and I would love to speak with her.
Thanks.
they said you needed to see me right away.
so what do you want, Summer. I usually don't get up for another few hours.
I hope this is important.
I like this time of day.
just before the sun gets too bright.
what do you want?
I'm done covering up for you.
what are you talking about?
I've been so stupid.
keeping your secret for so long.
I'm getting better, you know.
stronger.
I'm finally ready to stand up to you. To do what has to be done.
you shouldn't have hurt Keelin. She was my friend.
Hey, you're up.
I was letting you sleep, but Scanlon's on the phone. He says it's urgent.
Hello?
Allison, sorry to bother you on a Saturday,
but I think you might want to come meet me out at mariposa psych.
Oh, no, no, no.
summer Lowry's brother came to visit her first thing this morning.
she attacked him with a gardening spade.
stabbed him three times before the orderlies pulled her off.
Chad Lowry's dead.
it looks like she knew exactly what she was going to do when her brother got here this morning.
where is she?
they have her in isolation.
she's restrained.
apparently, she's been hysterical ever since they dragged her off her brother.
I just finished talking with the director of the hospital.
obviously Summer hasn't made as much progress as everyone thought.
but they... They finally calmed her down and she's starting to talk.
Allison, did you tell that girl that you thought her brother killed Keelin Mckinney?
I did. I did.
but I saw him do it, sir.
I-I just wanted to talk to her about what happened with her parents,
so she could clear her name.
I-I was just trying to help.
it's after 10: 00.
you getting up today or what?
it's Saturday. Leave me alone.
Nope. Stop sulking. Get up.
you need to see something.
you left these in my room yesterday.
and there is something in here you should see.
what are you talking about? That's my notebook.
what could be in that, that I don't already know about?
you recognize this?
it's Finn. Isn't it?
and you drew it?
Yeah. So?
so it's good.
and Marie didn't draw it, you did.
okay, tell me something I don't know.
Bridgette, there's... At least ten drawings like that.
all of Finn, and he's the only thing I've seen you try to draw
without an extra eye or giant buckteeth.
you draw him well.
you take time.
you take care.
and you look at those drawings, And you sense that they're filled with feeling.
Really?
trust me, you like Finn.
you, just you.
welcome aboard.
no fair. You can't stay out here all night.
all I've heard for the last three hours is how great Finn Milner is.
did you know that he can draw and paint,
and skateboard and hold his breath underwater for almost two whole minutes?
please, I'm in serious need of some adult conversation.
I'm sorry, I don't want to talk tonight.
I ruined a girl's life today, Joe.
I wanted to help her.
I wanted to convince the world that she wasn't a killer.
and all I did was convince her to become one.
become a killer?
did you use those exact words?
all I cared about was solving the case.
all I cared about was proving that Chad Lowry was the real murderer.
I didn't stop to think whether getting to the truth was the right thing for Summer.
I pressed her.
she wasn't ready.
Chad Lowry is dead because of me.
the man was a killer, Allison.
Yeah, well, now his little sister is, too.
so I'd like to try something new today, Keelin. - So I'd like to try something new today, Keelin.
it's good to hear your voice. - It's good to hear your voice.
it's always good to hear your voice. - It's always good to hear your voice.
but I want to hear what you have to say...
so I'm just going to stop talking and just listen.
hear what comes out. - Hear what comes out.
you know what? I really like you, Keelin.
you are such a good listener.
even combing your hair is nice.
it's like sharing a room with a doll.
a doll that breathes.
Oh, with everybody else I have to act.
I know a lot of people say that, But with me, it's true.
really true.
and I get so tired of it sometimes.
it takes a lot out of you-- acting all the time.
I had to do so much work to figure out how to pretend to be sick.
I had to pretend that I belong in a place like this,
and I did not think that people would believe me, but everyone did.
my parents-- They used to cry.
and they would say,"Summer, we don't understand what's wrong with you.
Keelin, is this something Summer said to you?
but they believed me.
everyone believed me.
I mean, I had to go ahead with everything after that, didn't I?
I had the whole world fooled.
they all thought that I was crazy. And now they think I'm getting better.
I'm a really good actor, Keelin.
when I get out of here, I think I'm going to go to California and I'm going to do movies.
I bet you my parents love me enough to buy a house in Beverly hills.
Oh, my god.
thank you. I'll knock if I need anything.
I'm not supposed to have visitors.
Yeah, well, they made a little-- A little exception for me.
I'm sorry if I got you in trouble.
I had to do that to Chad. I had to.
you certainly did.
so what kind of timetable are we talking about here?
I mean, how long are you going to string everyone along
till you start convincing them that you're getting better?
what are you talking about?
you know, I don't know how you do it.
I mean, if I was in here, I would go crazy.
they told me that you can't even have any books.
which is why I decided to pay you a little visit.
I'm gonna tell you a little story, if that's all right.
just to, you know, relieve the boredom.
so, once upon a time, there was a little girl.
she was 13 years old.
and her parents had everything.
which meant the little girl pretty much had everything.
but for this little girl, pretty much was not good enough.
she wanted it all.
but she didn't want to have to wait to inherit it,
and she didn't want to have to earn it herself.
she needed a shortcut.
so she came up with a plan with her older brother.
she decided to pretend that she was crazy.
and she was so good at it, that the whole world believed her.
so much so, that when her brother actually murdered their parents,
no one had any trouble believing it was the crazy, sick little girl;
that her demons had gotten the best of her.
that she just had to get packed away and shipped off to a hospital, so she could get all better.
this story is stupid. It doesn't make any sense.
why would anyone want to be here-- Locked up in a place like this?
because people like you, once they're feeling better,
once they can handle the world, well, they get to go home.
it was just about to happen.
everything was going according to the little girl's plan,
but then she made one little mistake.
she talked to her roommate.
she told her everything.
you know, the little girl thought that this was safe because the roommate
she didn't speak. She couldn't speak.
catatonic friends are great like that.
when Keelin started waking up,
when you realized that she was repeating everything you said, you must have been scared.
lucky for you that doctor didn't go straight to the police.
he just used everything he knew to try to get rich.
but of course, he underestimated how lucky and smart you are.
lucky because Keelin ran away.
you're smart because, once that happened, you had your brother kill dr. Woodel.
so everyone would think she did it.
and just like that, both of your problems were solved.
I'm confused.
you said this was a story, but you keep using the names of real people.
is that to make it more entertaining?
Yes.
to make it entertaining and fun.
and now I'm going to use my own name.
you remember when I showed up, started asking questions about your brother, about how he might be the real killer?
when did you decide to kill him?
that you actually had to kill someone yourself?
are you done?
I don't know.
how do you think it ends?
she gets away with it.
well... Yeah, you might be right.
you know, there's one part of the story that still bothers me.
what really happened to your friend Keelin?
I mean, how did she get out of here?
and how did your brother find her?
unless-- She never really escaped.
and she was here the whole time.
and you killed her.
you did it, didn't you?
she's still here. She's still here somewhere.
and I'm guessing it's in that little garden that you love so much.
it's a good place to bury a body, don't you think?
this is the exciting part of the story.
soon we're going to find out if I'm right.
cause I brought some police with me, and they-- they brought some dogs.
the kind of dogs that can smell drugs and corpses.
Oh, look... The dogs found something already.
you bitch!
now there you are. There's the real Summer Lowry.
well, welcome back.
you know this hospital here, It's not bad, all things considered.
but I don't think you're going to be spending a lot of time here.
I think you're going to be going to prison.
and that-- that is the ending of the story.
bet you didn't see that coming.
hello. I'm Rod Serling, speaking to you this evening from somewhere just beyond the Twilight Zone.
submitted for your approval or at least your analysis:
the strange case of you, the viewing audience.
the bizarre events in this evening's episode of Medium cannot be confined to two dimensions.
certain sequences of the story demand to be presented in 3D, so keep your glasses close at hand, seat yourself approximately six to eight feet from your screen, and whenever you see the logo in the corner
that's it right there-- put your glasses on.
if you don't have them, don't worry.
you can still enjoy the episode.
and now hold on.
our next stop, the Medium Zone.
I'm not really an art person, but ever since I was little girl, when I look at a work of art,
I sense things about the person who made it.
I think it might be because really gifted people can't help but leave a piece of their souls on the canvas.
ever wonder why the Mona Lisa is smiling or what's bothering Whistler's mother?
I really believe if I were ever able to get to Paris and look at the original paintings,
I might be able to tell you.
like this guy here.
look at his face.
what do you see?
an artistic genius or a jilted lover?
creative fulfillment or massive self-loathing?
simple exhaustion or overwhelming depression?
Vincent Van Gogh fell in love twice in his life, but was spurned by both women.
he ended up spending most of his short adult life in and out of mental institutions, until at the age of 36, after a ten-year frenzy of painting, he decided to end it all.
van Gogh committed suicide at the height of his artistic powers.
tragically, he sold but one canvas during his entire life.
if you like vital programs like the one you just saw, we urge you to give and give generously.
Oliver Wendell Holmes was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902.
he is one of the most important justices in American history - and is sometimes called "The Great Dissenter" - What does that mean?
he was called that because he disagreed so often with the other judges.
his important cases were...
but I don't understand.
I thought that disagreements were bad.
mom...
Bridgette, Ariel's practicing.
why don't we listen to what she has to say and we'll ask questions afterwards?
I was listening.
Ooh, look at you.
wow, Daddy, you sure look nice.
did you hear the first part?
I was riveted, and it's the fifth time I've heard it.
now hang on one sec, and I'm coming over to hear the thrilling conclusion.
you're kidding, right?
well, it's the law of probabilities.
every time you wear a tie, it goes into your coffee or your coffee gets on it.
come on, this is your one tie.
your boss asked you out to lunch.
thought you might want to keep it clean.
I do want to keep it clean, but if I put this thing under my chin and anyone sees it, they're going to take away my "man" card, and we don't want that.
Ah, suit yourself.
Hello, ladies.
now, you were saying...?
daddy.
you still look nice, Daddy.
okay...
see what I can do.
Ariel, finish making the lunches!
and, Bridgette, honey, brush your teeth!
don't waste your time.
that one's had it.
you can't do that.
Yeah, that's one of the best parts of being dead.
Yeah, you just wait till it's your turn. You'll see.
what are you doing here?
I'm just visiting my only son and his only wife.
go figure.
boy's pushing 40, and every time he dresses up, he still fidgets like he's...
he's going out to have his class picture taken.
forget it, forget it. Just...
get him the one that's in your bottom drawer that you're saving for Christmas.
what?
what do you want?
just concerned about my boy.
now, we both know that he can't make grown-up decisions.
no, I'm sorry. I don't know that.
please...
what? What is your problem?
you had no time for this man when you were alive.
now you're dead you think you can just pop in whenever the hell you want and offer some fatherly advice?!
leave us alone!
this is my bathroom!
I'd like a little privacy!
I'd like to be able to use the toilet, if you don't mind!
hey...
no problem.
I'll tell him to call back.
tell who to call back?
detective Scanlon.
any luck with that?
no. In my bottom drawer, there's a new one in a Christmas box.
Really?
wait, wait, wait, wait, give me the phone.
Thanks. Hello?
Oh, my God.
who was it?
I don't know.
they haven't found a body yet.
doesn't look like you'd have to look very far.
we've been all over the park.
nothing.
so far, all I've got is what looks like a couple of quarts of type O-positive and a vagrant who claims he heard a man and a woman arguing in here sometime last night.
I called the morgue.
no John or Jane Does were brought in.
same deal with the hospitals.
you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
does "Jack's Gal" mean anything?
hope you brought your appetite.
Absolutely. It travels with me wherever I go.
so, I'm guessing you know this by heart.
afraid so. Probably eaten here at least twice a week for the last eight years.
so what do you recommend? What's good?
me? I recommend change.
I recommend that nobody eat in the same place twice a week for eight years.
it dulls the palate and mutes the soul.
I'm leaving Aerodytech, Joe.
I'm giving my notice at the end of the day.
okay.
well, congratulations, I guess.
our loss is somebody else's gain.
so who poached you?
was it Grumman? Boeing?
nobody poached me.
I'm starting my own company.
and the reason I asked you to lunch is, well... I need a partner.
I've got the financing, but I need a sounding board, a confidante, not to mention a gifted engineer.
close your mouth, Joe.
you'll draw flies.
what do you do if someone knocks on the door?
I don't open it.
what do you do if you smell smoke?
I dial 911.
and what do you do if I want to watch something and you don't?
I want a regular babysitter.
we don't need a regular babysitter.
I'm old enough to babysit, and besides, it's an emergency.
right, Mom?
Bridgette, honey,
daddy called at the last minute.
he wants me to meet him for dinner downtown.
there's something very important he wants to talk about.
I don't care! She's going to be mean to me!
she's not going to be mean to you. She's your sister.
now come on.
mom!
okay, come on, everybody out. I'm going to be late.
let's go.
come on, out. Out, out, out, out. Go.
he says he's got to know in three days.
something about the financing.
well, what do you think?
what do I think?
I think it's scary and flattering, and scary and flattering, and scary and...
the guy's the best combination of businessman and engineer I've ever met.
I keep thinking about all these magazine articles I've read about Wozniak and Jobs getting together, about...
bill Gates and Paul Allen.
I keep wondering if this is the beginning of something like that.
and then I keep thinking about the...
the company health plan, and my great parking space, and the company Christmas party
the stupid stuff I've come to depend on.
Hey.
no fair. Where'd you go?
what does that say?
what's what say?
okay, tree with stuff hanging from it.
nice.
I kind of like this one.
I wonder who she is.
she's so beautiful and her eyes are so sad.
her eyes?
are you okay?
yeah... I'm fine.
sorry.
it just looked like...
never mind.
you sure?
what time did you tell the kids?
must take after her mother.
do you mind?
me? I'm dead. I don't mind much of anything anymore.
well, I do, so I'd appreciate it if you'd just go away.
I can't go away,
Allie dear.
not until I've...
I've said my piece.
about what?
my son
the entrepreneur.
Oh... you know about that, huh?
I know everything.
that's one of the perks of my current condition.
now, look, far be it from me to stand in the way of my son's dream.
but trust me when I say that this new business venture is not the right way for him to go.
and why would I do that?
trust you, I mean.
what the hell's that supposed to mean?
it means you never once supported any of Joe's decisions.
even when you were alive.
I let him marry you, didn't I?
fine, be that way.
just make sure that Joe knows that Versailles's running on fumes.
what?
just tell him that.
Versailles's running on fumes.
he needs to hear that.
it's important.
thought you might want to know we got a positive ID on the owner of that blood we found in the park yesterday.
Mexican citizen, but a frequent border-hopper.
that's how we had her DNA on file.
she was brought in on a solicitation charge in El Paso.
so that explains what she was doing in the park.
what?
I've seen this woman before.
last night, actually.
what do you mean?
like in a dream?
it was in a gallery.
I was at this art gallery and this local artist,
I saw this woman in one of his paintings.
you sure it was her?
can you take me there, to that gallery?
I don't think it'll help.
the painting in the gallery is of the back of her head.
then how do you know it's Gloria Soto?
because...
she turned and looked at me.
Hello?
detective Scanlon.
this is Allison Dubois with the District Attorney's office.
we're, uh...
we're working a missing persons case and your name came up during the course of our investigation.
that sounds ominous.
who's gone missing?
she's a Mexican, 34 years of age.
very pretty.
I'm sorry, I don't know that name.
maybe you'll know the face.
no. I've never actually seen this woman before.
wait a second. Are you telling me that she never posed for you?
that's right.
I don't use models.
actually, Gloria was a prostitute.
I don't use those either.
but if you could tell me how my name came up, perhaps I could be of a little more help.
Allison, you okay?
Yeah, I-I'm fine.
could... could I trouble you for a glass of water?
in that back room over there.
what are you doing?
it's not just me, right?
you see her face, too?
plain as day.
want to tell me again, Mr. Morrow, how you never met Gloria Soto?
good morning.
good morning.
um, if I could just have a word.
excuse us.
sorry. I'm sorry.
that's my office.
I know, I know, and honestly, we've been in there all of three minutes.
he insisted.
and he is?
worth conservatively a quarter of a billion dollars.
or at least his late wife was.
okay.
and late last night, apparently on your say-so, his son was ordered held in connection with some missing persons case.
so he called his good friend the mayor, who called you...
at 3: 30 this morning...
and told you to get down here and convince me to let him go.
well, I'm sorry to disappoint His Honor, but as he very well knows,
I can hold a suspect, any suspect, rich, poor or otherwise, without actually charging him for 24 hours.
no, he knows that.
it's just-- since there's no firm evidence to actually implicate this man, we were wondering if you could possibly see your way clear...
no, I can't.
and you tell the mayor I have a bathroom full of blood and a team of professional investigators telling me that Jason Morrow is connected.
that's enough for me, and it should be enough for the mayor.
Mr. District Attorney,
Mr. Morrow.
I couldn't help but overhear the tail end of that exchange.
look, just so everyone's intentions are clear
when this evening rolls around, if you still don't have enough evidence to charge my son,
I will be filing a lawsuit against you and the City of Phoenix for wrongful arrest.
you thank the mayor for his help.
I'll see myself out.
it's not here.
I'll get it.
hello.
Oh, good morning, sir.
you did?
well, I'm sorry. I lost it.
I found it!
Joe found it.
it's Devalos. He was trying to call me on my cell phone.
Yeah, I can be there at 10: 30.
fine.
thank you.
thank you.
look at you.
you're as nervous as a cat.
I-I haven't been to a lawyer since we bought this house.
you have your little list of questions?
do I ever.
I got my health insurance packet,
aerodytech contract, my pension fund statements.
you know, the irony is I'm going to spend the whole day with this guy, and then when it's over,
I'm still not going to know whether to do it or not.
I'm sorry, honey,
I wish I had an answer.
what good are you?
I'll show you what good I am.
does the name "Versailles" mean anything to you?
used to be a big fancy building in France.
Why?
well, your father showed up again here last night.
and he told me you shouldn't go into business with Andrew because...
wait, I want to get this right...
Versailles is running on fumes.
Versailles is running on fumes? It was the middle of the night, and it was your father.
he told me you needed to hear that.
Thanks, Dad.
I'll be sure and tell that to the lawyer.
do I look okay?
I'm paying this guy $250 an hour, and I'm worried about what I look like.
you look like a captain of industry.
you look like an admiral of industry.
Admiral's bigger than captain, right?
I have no idea.
I got to go.
I understand, Judge, but I'd be remiss if I didn't tell you I think you're making a mistake.
Jason Morrow is our only connection to this missing woman.
respectfully, I disagree...
we will work harder, sir.
you count on it.
no warrant.
the judge seems to feel that we're reaching.
so, I guess Jason Morrow's car, home, studio
they're all off limits?
well, we can still hold him for another 10 hours, but unless we have any physical evidence that he was involved in the disappearance of Gloria Soto, he'll walk.
I wish I could tell you that I had a dream last night that would narrow down the search for the body.
but so far I've only been able to see things when I look at one of Morrow's paintings.
well, in that case,
I think you'll appreciate the homework we've assembled for you in the conference room.
47 paintings in total, every one of them a Jason Morrow original.
figure it'll keep you busy for the rest of the morning.
wait, I thought that we couldn't get a search warrant on his studio?
we couldn't.
I spent most of last night visiting all the local galleries, flashing my badge and asking if the Phoenix P. D.
could "borrow" everything they had by Jason Morrow.
just watch where you put that coffee;
we break anything, we pay for it.
give us a call if you see something.
where are you going?
I'm going to go look for a tree with a hundred pairs of sneakers dangling from it.
self Portrait." Jason, it doesn't look a thing like you.
good-bye, my darling.
Hello?
how much you know about local high school football?
not much. Why?
it turns out the Flagstaff Cougars have this funny little tradition.
every year the graduating seniors tie their cleats together and throw them over the branches of a dead ash tree near their favorite drinking spot in the woods.
if I give you directions, how soon can you be here?
one adult female, one male child.
forensic techs figure they've been here at least 20 years.
which means she couldn't possibly be Gloria Soto.
and unless Jason Morrow was one very advanced toddler...
I'm guessing he's not our killer.
we're 20 hours into the custody of Jason Morrow, and we're still no closer to finding the body of Gloria Soto.
we have, however, found two bodies that we weren't looking for, but we can be reasonably certain that our suspect had nothing to do with their deaths, given the fact that he was a toddler at the time.
I don't know what to tell you.
all I can say is, I saw Gloria Soto being buried in that grave.
no, you didn't.
you saw her mother, Inez Soto.
we I. D.'d her off her dental records.
they matched a missing persons report her family filed in Mexico in 1982.
1982?
apparently, the Mexican authorities forwarded it to us at the time.
someone spent about a half a day looking into it, and then it sat in a drawer until this afternoon.
Oh, my God, she looks exactly like her daughter.
I thought I saw someone digging a grave for Gloria, but I must've seen someone digging a grave for her mother.
now, here's an interesting factoid
care to guess who Inez was working for when she disappeared in '82?
according to the file
david Morrow.
wait a second, the woman whose corpse you just found worked for Jason Morrow's father?
according to her family, she was working for him as a maid, making money to send back home to Mexico to her daughter.
had a son, too. Tomas.
he was born here in the States.
disappeared when she did.
that must've been the boy, the same one I saw in Jason's paintings.
I have...
a present for you, by the way.
a little something, to, uh, complete your collection.
where did this come from?
stopped by to see Jason Morrow in his holding cell to see if his plush surroundings triggered any new recollections about Gloria Soto.
he was working on it the whole time I was there
I asked him if I could see it.
he told me to keep it.
good-bye, my darling.
feel better, little baby.
there were two little babies
there had to be.
there was Inez's son, and there was Jason.
Jason was a witness.
he doesn't remember anything;
he was too young.
but it's all in there.
every time I see one of his paintings come to life,
I'm seeing what happened through his eyes.
I-I'm sorry, I'm not sure I follow you.
well, think about it.
he couldn't have killed the mother and son.
but he could have seen his father do it.
look, I think what happened to Inez and her son is terrible.
from what little I remember of them, they were nice people.
but if you're suggesting that I had anything to do with their deaths...
we just wanted to ask you a few questions.
well, considering the fact that you just released my son after incarcerating him for 24 hours, you'll forgive me if I'm not feeling especially cooperative.
you ever been convicted of a felony, Mr. Morrow?
Yes, I was arrested several times, but I'm guessing that you already know that.
heroin possession, right?
it happened over 20 years ago, Detective.
a youthful indiscretion.
more like three youthful indiscretions, actually.
what about assault and battery charges your wife filed?
Emily dropped those charges.
it was a misunderstanding.
now, are you finished, or do I need to call my lawyer?
no, no.
I've only got one more question for you.
why'd you kill Inez and her kid?
she hear something she shouldn't have?
try to blackmail you, maybe?
that's your theory?
I killed her to protect my money.
that's a good theory, it's clever, except for one thing.
everything you see here, none of it belongs to me.
it never has.
my wife's family didn't particularly like me, and I'm guessing that had something to do with the arrest that you mentioned.
while my wife was alive, we lived off of her trust fund, and after my wife passed, all of the assets were transferred to my son Jason. Okay?
this house is his. Everything.
he lets me live here.
he gives me...
an allowance,
I guess you could call it.
okay.
maybe you two had an affair.
she called it off...
detective, you're embarrassing yourself.
I told you not to play with that boy!
he can make you sick.
he can kill you.
now, tilt your head back.
Dr. Tedesco said we have to be sure to get every drop of blood off you.
keep your eyes open.
...guess we'll be giving you a call, and, uh, you can come down to the station to make a statement.
that was productive.
actually, it was.
you saw something in there?
I saw Inez Soto again when I was looking at that painting.
she was giving one of the boys a bath.
I mean, she was the maid.
no, it wasn't like that
she was scared of something.
she mentioned the other boy. She said he was sick.
and she mentioned a doctor.
Tedesco. Dr. Tedesco.
it seemed important.
a name-- now, that I can work with.
Oh.
hmm.
Mm!
after a long day of hard work,
I really look forward to a brewski.
hmm, well, then, my dear, you are doomed for an evening of disappointment.
a man-- a man with a mask
came into our house and stole all of our brewskis.
Mm.
so I'm sitting in our $250
an-hour lawyer's office and I think it's hour three and he says to me, "Is it true the fellows from Versailles Capital are funding you and Andrew?
and all I could think of is...
Versailles is running on fumes.
and I was, like, "I don't know." I mean, I do know.
at least I strongly suspect based on our conversation this morning.
but I don't know.
so what do you do?
I pretended my phone was vibrating, that it was a call from you.
I told him I had to wrap up this meeting and I got out of there and I went over to Andrew's house, and I just asked him.
And?
and he said, "Keep it under your hat, Joe, but yes, "Versailles Capital has agreed to provide 100 percent of the startup funding for Gossamer.
that's the name we came up with-- Gossamer.
that's a great name.
that's a beautiful name, my emperor of industry.
so what are you going to do?
I already did it.
I told him I couldn't join him.
told him I wouldn't.
did you tell him why?
did I tell him my dead father told me the money's not going to come through?
no, I didn't.
I don't know why. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
but, Joe, maybe you could find somebody else to fund you guys.
maybe... but I already told him.
I'm sure he's out to somebody else by now.
I'm so sorry.
I would've missed the Christmas party.
and my great parking space.
Mm-mm-hmm.
and we do have a hell of a health plan.
you're a liar.
I should get that. The girls...
Oh! Wait, you just sit. I'll get it.
Hello?
tracked down this guy Tedesco.
turns out he's an immunologist, one of the first pediatric AIDS specialists in Phoenix.
I... I don't understand.
was Inez's son sick?
d-did he remember him?
he doesn't remember anything.
he passed away in '86, but his wife still has all his old medical files in the garage, and I badgered her and she let me take a look.
And?
and he never treated Tomas, but get this.
he did treat Jason Morrow.
turns out Jason's parents were both intravenous drug users, but only mom got sick.
apparently she passed AIDS to him in the womb.
according to the file,
Jason's case was terminal.
life expectancy, four years, max.
wait a second, how is that possible?
Jason's got to be at least 25.
actually, no.
he's not. He's dead.
you led us to his body.
Oh, my God, that little boy in the grave.
wasn't Inez Soto's son.
Tomas Soto's still alive, only he thinks he's Jason Morrow.
Mr. Morrow, thank you for coming in on a Saturday, sir.
I'm only here because my son asked me to come down and join him.
he's waiting in the conference room. Right this way.
you all right?
I'm fine.
why did they bring you down here?
to formally apologize.
the city of Phoenix sincerely regrets holding you in connection with the disappearance of Gloria Soto.
we recognize it as an ordeal and a massive inconvenience and for that, we sincerely apologize.
fine. That's a start.
but if you think it's going to make us stop our lawsuit, you're wrong.
I can assure you,
I'm under no such misapprehension.
good. Then we'll see you in court.
probably sooner than you think.
what's this?
it's a medical report on Jason Morrow.
your son. It dates back to 1982.
you got this from Dr. Michael Tedesco?
his widow, actually.
imagine Jason's surprise when he heard that he'd been diagnosed with AIDS at birth.
seems like the type of thing you'd mention... Dad.
I don't know where you're going with this, Manuel, but you know damn well that file is protected under doctor-patient confidentiality.
Absolutely.
but since Jason here is supposedly the patient, he found the contents fascinating.
I never told you because it wasn't true.
I mean, I fired this doctor.
he misdiagnosed you.
I mean, obviously, look at you, you're fine.
so what was wrong with me?
you suffered from a rare form of pediatric pneumonia.
I took you to a clinic in Switzerland.
you recovered.
and you have documentation to prove that?
my client is not obliged to produce medical records of any kind.
it was very important to you that Jason stay alive, wasn't it?
of course. He's my son.
right.
and after your wife, Emily, passed, if Jason hadn't survived his bout of-- what'd you call it, "pneumonia
you would have been cut out of the family money, wouldn't you?
Mr. District Attorney,
I demand to know, are you accusing my client of something here?
only murder.
two counts for now.
probably three when all is said and done.
this meeting is over.
sit down, Dad.
Jason, I don't know what they've been telling you, but it's not true.
David, we should go.
your wife died of AIDS in 1982.
you knew your son didn't have long to live, and you knew that when he died, your last connection to your wife's family money would die with him.
so you did the only thing you could do.
you went looking for a replacement.
and luckily you didn't have to look far.
your maid's son was about the same age as Jason.
she was an undocumented immigrant, somebody you thought nobody would miss.
so you killed her.
and then you did something unthinkable.
you killed your own diseased child, and you raised Inez Soto's healthy boy as your own.
none of this is true.
well, there's a simple way to prove that.
Jason has agreed to give us a blood sample.
if you're willing to do the same, and the DNA indicates that the two of you are, in fact, related, then we'll know that all of this was just a product of our overactive imaginations.
come on, Dad.
doesn't even hurt.
at the end of the day, we can show them how wrong they are.
you know you cannot compel my client to give you a DNA sample.
you're right.
but I can compare the sample I already drew from Jason to the DNA from Inez Soto's remains.
in fact, it's being done right now.
and if the comparison shows me what I think it's going to
that the man raised as Jason Morrow is in fact Tomas Soto
then I'll have more than enough to make a case against your client.
you're welcome to go somewhere and wait it out if you want, but I'll be on your ass the whole time.
or we can stay right here and talk about a deal.
who knows, you tell me where Gloria Soto's body is,
I'll even consider taking the death penalty off the table.
my card's higher.
you sure?
I'm this sure.
I call.
I win!
no, you don't.
I have an ace.
you have a one.
daddy, doesn't four beat one?
sorry, kiddo. Ace beats all.
ha!
Hey, nobody told me we were having a barbecue.
Hey.
how'd it go?
well, the father confessed to everything.
he even told us where he buried Gloria Soto.
Congratulations.
Oh, I guess there's good news all around.
I had an interesting call.
it seems they're having a hard time filling Andrew's position, and guess what?
they want me to interview for the job.
way to go, Emperor!
I'm going to go change; I'll be right back.
Hey! Hey!
see? Everything works out for the best.
apparently.
Thanks, I guess.
Ah, one thing, though.
um, that firm of theirs, that Gossamer thing?
it's actually going to be a success.
it's actually going to do all right.
not, not huge, but... all right.
what? I don't understand.
well, I just didn't want you to see it happen later and get angry with me.
I mean, like I said, everything works out for the best.
well, wait a second.
now I'm not so sure it has.
trust me. If he took that partnership, he'd spend the next 12 years working 70-hour weeks.
and he'd have told himself that he was doing it for you, for the kids.
and he wouldn't have known that he was losing you guys until it was too late.
are you crazy? Lose us?
Joe could never lose us.
uh, not all at once.
it happens gradually.
late night by late night, weekend by weekend.
before you know it, you miss a birthday, then an anniversary.
and then one day your kid is packing up to go to off to college, and you realize you're saying good-bye to a stranger.
so you thought Joe was going to turn into you?
I knew he was. I saw it.
no, you're wrong.
it wouldn't have happened that way.
Joe is not like you.
and I don't care.
Joe and I are grownups.
we have the right to know the truth.
that was our risk to take.
I don't know. It's 1: 00 on a Saturday afternoon.
you're home. He's home.
the burgers are almost ready.
and your little girls have cards stuck to their foreheads.
who might this be?
looks familiar.
he and his friend raped a young girl.
sliced her open, took her apart.
Dr. Charles "the butcher," Walker of Wichita.
wanted dead or alive for the maniacal evisceration of three unmarried daughters from the great plains.
he was captured and lynched by an angry mob in 1902
pretty good match, right?
1934, Dr. Eric Lorenz murdered a 16-year-old patient who was complaining of swollen tonsils. He said he heard voices.
1950, Dr. Kevin Diebold raped and murdered a 12-year-old patient while her mother and two brothers sat in the waiting room.
he said he heard a voice.
interesting.
in 1960, Dr. Peter... Shonry raped and murdered a 13-year-old in a public health clinic in detroit.
there's another one in 1977.
you killed her in 91.
seems like every 15 years or so, someone hears a voice and a young girl dies.
ladies.
if you'll kindly take a seat in the waiting room, the doctor and I will finish up and be with you shortly.
there you go, Mrs. Jorgensen.
I trimmed the fat off just the way you like.
thank you, dear.
see you next week. - Okay.
number 74.
here.
what can I do you for, sir?
what's fresh today?
the veal cutlets are awfully nice.
actually, I was looking for something a little more exotic.
hmm. Something exotic...
how about these?
they're perfect for frying.
nice.
how much would you recommend per person?
as an appetizer, I mean.
a quarter pound each should do it.
make it half a pound. I'm entertaining a lady friend.
something in mind for a main course?
I'm not sure yet, but I want it to be special.
we might have just the thing for you, sir.
Oh, yeah.
that's perfect.
my gals gonna love that.
isn't that right, love?
isn't that right... Allison?
you doing okay?
I just nodded off for a second.
it was him again.
he's back. I know it.
Allison, I need you to focus on what's happening right here, right now.
you're right.
did the district attorney's office call? Did Devalos call?
Yeah. He said he felt terrible about it.
he said he...
he wished you could understand. But he said there's nothing he can really do.
at least not tonight.
of course.
right. Uh...
well, in that case,
I think we should get this over with.
pursuant to the penal code of the state of Arizona...
...you're under arrest for assault with intent to cause bodily injury.
if it were any other day, we could get you arraigned and out of here.
well, next time I decide to assault somebody,
I'll make sure it's not on a Sunday.
look, I'll stall as long as I can but sooner or later, they're gonna want to take you downstairs and put you in a holding cell for the night.
have you heard from my husband?
Yeah. The officer who dropped your daughter off said he was trying to get someone to watch the girls.
he should be coming through the door any minute.
Hey, I need your help.
I need you to listen to this young woman.
I need you to do what she says, go to bed when she tells you to.
but... - and most of all,
I need you to not fight with your sister.
but... - ah-ah.
okay? Now listen.
if I'm still not here by the time you wake up, then I need you to do whatever kim tells you to.
go to school and know that by the time you come home, mommy or me or both of us will be here.
okay?
but I don't want mommy to be in jail.
Mrs. Dubois is in jail?
what did she do?
nothing. It's just, it's all a misunderstanding.
Ah... okay, so you got my cell phone number.
with any luck, I'll be home in a couple hours.
morning, mommy. Morning, daddy.
what's all this?
I made coffee.
two percent and sugar for you...
and black for you.
I find this very frightening.
enjoy!
would you look at that.
the troops are feeding themselves.
I made our lunches, too, and checked bridgette's homework for her.
Mm! Wow! Thank you.
do you want a waffle?
okay, what's going on?
it's not my birthday, it's not father's day...
she's buttering you up.
that's okay, I like butter.
unless you're looking for another advance on your allowance.
it's not that.
can I go to the movies this saturday with some friends from school?
uh, depends.
depends on what?
on the movie; the friends.
well, I don't know what movie yet.
do you know what friends yet?
her boyfriend, Todd Gromada.
he's not my boyfriend.
but he did ask me to go with him and his friends.
girls, too.
honey... we talked about this.
if there are no parents there, then your mom and I need to know who the kids are.
I'm trying to tell you who they are.
and that means that one or both of us need to actually have met them. Which means actually laid eyes on them, talked to their parents, that kind of thing.
but he's really nice, dad. You'll like him.
his mom died when he was little, and his dad is a doctor.
I'm sure he is very nice, sweetie, but that's not the point.
Yeah, and he's 14.
Fourteen?
I guess. He's in the eighth grade.
eighth grade?
no.
no way are you going to the movies with a 14-year-old and a bunch of his friends.
but, dad, he asked me.
no. Uh-uh. It's not gonna happen.
but, dad...
I expect you to back me up on this.
14? Absolutely. God!
she's gonna come to you next, so we need to be on the same page.
how old were you when your parents started letting you do stuff like meet boys at the mall?
I don't know. About Ariel's age.
wrong answer.
Oh, my gosh. If Todd Gromada had asked me to go to the movies and my parents said no I don't know what I would do.
I know.
have you told Todd you can't go yet?
no. It's so embarrassing. He's never gonna talk to me again.
excuse me, sir. Is this where the history books are?
some of them.
what time period would you be interested in?
I'm doing a report on women in the pioneer days.
women in the pioneer days!
well... lucky for you that is a particular interest of mine.
she'll be arraigned first thing tomorrow.
soon as you post bail, you can take her home.
okay, that's a relief.
is there any way that I can see her tonight?
Absolutely. She's right in here.
how are the girls? - They miss you.
they want you home.
even Ariel?
of course.
I still can't understand why she took off like that.
I've never been so scared.
I was sure something horrible had happened to her.
I know, I know, I know. It's okay.
you just overreacted, that's all.
sorry to interrupt.
it's time to go downstairs.
what... hold on a second. Just wait a second.
I mean, there's got to be some way around this.
I mean, you know her. After all that she's done for you people. You know her
I wish there were.
maybe in the morning.
in the morning?
okay, look, it's fine. It's gonna be 12 or 14 hours. I'll be fine.
well, I'm gonna wait right here.
that would be silly.
Joe, go home, be with the girls.
I love you.
I love you.
Hey, Ariel.
Hi, Todd.
so, what's up?
nothing.
Shh!
so you coming saturday?
um... I can't.
how come?
I-I just can't.
on Sunday...
...my dad said I could have some people over to swim and stuff.
maybe you could drop by, or whatever.
maybe, yeah.
look, if you don't want to come...
I do, I... I just...
have to ask your mommy.
shut up, dude. - Look at her, she's like 12.
come on, Todd, let's go.
see you around.
Oh, my goodness
how tragic
sorry, I know it's none of my business, but I couldn't help overhearing.
he's sweet on you, you know.
he is-- a fellow can tell.
it doesn't matter. I can't see him outside of school.
my parents won't let me go anywhere, do anything.
Yeah, parents are funny like that.
especially nowadays. It's like they don't want their children to grow up.
didn't used to be like that.
like in the pioneer days...
...a girl your age would be practically old enough to get married.
you know that Juliet was only 13.
Really? 13?
the word "teenager" didn't even exist until 50 or 60 years ago.
it was only invented to help parents prolong childhood for as long as possible.
my point is...
you know that you're mature and responsible, even if your parents haven't caught on yet.
they don't need to know all your business.
there's no harm keeping things from them that they'd rather not hear, like, say...
where you're really going when there's a boy you want to see.
but I can't lie.
so do you want to go to this boy's on Sunday or what?
it's a little cold in here, doctor.
come on now.
have you seen her?
have you looked at her? This is the greatest moment of your life.
is this going to hurt, doctor?
she wants some doctoring, my friend.
she needs some doctoring.
don't keep the young woman waiting, she's cold.
they're lovely when they're cold.
little river of blood making its way across her flushed skin.
really... this is going to be the greatest moment of your life.
a nice clean cut, mate.
remember...
this is the greatest moment of your life.
Hey, honey, hold still...
but I can't see the TV.
who designs these things?
what is a puca, and why does it have a shell?
okay, there we go. All right.
Yeah, that looks nice.
anything?
Mm... no, doesn't seem to be.
so maybe it was just a dream.
maybe.
Hi, mom.
Hi, dad.
am I imagining things, or is our daughter speaking to us again?
I'm not mad anymore. It's no big deal.
I'd rather hang out with my friends, anyway.
Really?
Hannah invited Celeste and me over to her house on sunday afternoon.
sounds like fun.
do you need anyone to drop you off or anything?
I think Hannah's mom said that she would pick us up
but I'll check.
excellent spelling, middle child.
Hey, look.
that's Ariel's boyfriend behind us.
he's not my boyfriend.
his license plate almost spells "doctor."
I wonder if he knows that he spelled it wrong.
it's on purpose, doofus.
Todd's dad is a doctor.
well, then how come he doesn't know how to spell it?
forget it.
okay, okay. Goodbye, my beautiful girls.
okay. - Bye!
Bye, kittens. - Bye-bye.
you want to be careful not to put anything other than paper down the toilet.
they back up all the time, and there'll be nobody here to fix it until 10: 00 tomorrow morning.
he was just sitting right there in the car.
well, now you're contradicting yourself.
I'm not contradicting myself.
he was right there, then he was gone.
but he was definitely there.
okay. Fine, he was there. So what do you want to do?
well, jeepers, pa, what do you want to do?
Hey, I'm just trying to be practical.
it seems to me we've already done it.
we've forbidden Ariel from seeing this boy, so presumably she's not going to have any contact with his father, right?
and if your thesis here is that this guy's walker's next cipher, that this guy's somehow in the market for some young girl to cut up...
then the key is to make sure Ariel has no contact with him.
what about all the other girls he does have contact with?
do we just sit around and let this guy set a trap for someone else's daughter?
huh? And what about Dr. Gromada?
are we just going to let him be tortured, day in and day out, hearing some voice in his head urging him to kill?
what am I supposed to do, Joe?
just sit around and wait for it to happen?
I don't understand how can you dismiss this so easily.
Hey, I'm not dismissing anything.
but don't you find it monumentally coincidental that of all the doctors in the world, the one that walker chooses happens to be the father of a boy our daughter has a crush on?
cause I do-- I find that monumentally coincidental.
so I'm asking you to consider the slim possibility
before we turn our neighbors in to the police based on theories that are difficult, if not impossible to prove;
before we embarrass our daughter in front of her friends, before we label respected members of the community as future child murderers
that perhaps you've taken a dream you had about a case from a year ago and mixed it up with the anxiety you're having about your oldest daughter wanting to begin dating boys, and projected that onto the boy's father.
Hi, Todd.
Hey, Ariel.
so are you still having people over on Sunday?
cause... maybe if you were, I'd come.
Yeah, it's still on; come.
cool. So, where do you live?
out by lakewood.
it's the big pinkish house on hyacinth.
Yeah, okay. I'll find it.
cool.
see you there, okay? - See you.
did he say lakewood? That's, like, all the way across town from where you live.
how are you even going to get there?
I don't know.
I haven't figured that out yet.
you having a problem?
uh... no, my car just conked out while I was waiting.
well, I can take a look, if you want.
not that I'm an expert or anything.
Oh, that would be great.
I can use any help I can get.
I'm Allison; I'm Ariel Dubois' mom.
Jim-- I'm Todd Gromada's dad.
well, I appreciate it, Jim.
it's funny, this little voice in my head this morning told me I should take this car in to get serviced.
Oh, yeah?
you know that little voice in your head sometimes people talk about?
your battery contacts are pretty dirty, but that shouldn't cause it to just stop.
you don't think I'm crazy, do you, talking about a little voice?
excuse me?
you just said something; I wasn't really listening.
that's okay.
sometimes it's hard to hear what people say when you have a voice in your head trying to talk to you, too.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
nothing. I'm just... rambling.
excuse me, do you know Ariel?
do-do any of you know Ariel-- Ariel Dubois? Is she here?
I don't know. Out back by the pool or something.
Mrs. Dubois?
Mrs. Dubois?
here's your problem.
your coil cable was loose.
voila!
Hey, mom.
Hi, mom.
um, can I put this in the car?
I'm walking home with Hannah, and I don't want to have to carry it.
are you Ariel?
I'm Dr. Gromada, Todd's dad.
get in the car. - Mom, this is my friend Todd's dad.
is everything all right? - get in the car.
mom, I'm walking home.
not today.
thank you for your help. I think I have everything under control now.
are you sure?
I-I feel like...
have I done something to upset you?
Hey, air.
Hey, dad.
what's going on?
I have no idea.
sounds like she made quite a scene, your mum.
I hate her.
and my dad's pretty mad at her, too.
have you seen Todd since it happened?
once, in the hallway, but he pretended not to see me.
well, you can explain when you see him on sunday.
I'm not going to see him on sunday.
I can't go, not after what happened.
you have to go. Especially after what happened.
I thought you liked him.
I know he likes you.
listen to me.
you can't leave it like this. You'll never forgive yourself.
you don't understand. Even if I wanted to go,
I have no way of getting there.
ride your bike.
too far.
what about the bus?
by myself?
do you have any girlfriends that live close to Todd?
I don't know.
maybe Celeste.
but what good does that do?
what's up? Where are you going?
don't get up.
it's sunday. It's fine.
um, Ariel wants me to run her over to Celeste's.
okay.
well, she gonna come in and say good-bye?
it's okay. She's already in the car.
just let it go, huh? She'll get over it.
just give her some time, yeah?
the girls and I are going to the car wash.
it's going to be very exciting.
you sure you don't want to join us?
Nah.
it's a tough ticket, but I know people.
I think I can get you in.
think I'll pass.
I don't think my fragile constitution could handle it.
Oh, what time is Ariel due back?
I told her I'd pick her up at 4: 00.
all right, well, if you're in a jam, let me know-- I can pick her up.
al, it's 2: 00. I'm going to the carwash. I should be back in 45 minutes.
okay. - All right.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
hello.
is Ariel Dubois at home?
may I ask who's calling?
a friend.
no. I'm sorry. She's not home right now.
I see.
do you happen to know where she is?
no. I'm sorry, I don't.
Oh. I do.
Hi. Hello? Hi.
this is Allison Dubois. I'm Ariel's mother.
Hi, Celeste. Listen, I need to speak with Ariel.
what do you mean she's not there?
we have, uh, diet stuff.
juice, milk, whatever you want.
I don't know. Water, I guess.
so, I didn't think you were really gonna come.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry about that thing with my mom.
she can kind of be out there sometimes.
I better get that, but don't go anywhere, okay?
okay.
Oh... hi. What-what are you doing here?
never mind that.
we've got a problem. Your mother's on her way.
what? My mom?
this way.
come on!
dad!
dad!
Where's Ariel?
where... where is ariel?
uh, out back by the pool...
hey...
mom!
mom, mom, stop it!
mom, stop it!
isn't god the most inspired architect?
look at that. She knows it, too.
she knows she's a work of divine genius.
what she doesn't understand is just how short-lived her divinity is.
14, 15, 16-- those years
they're like the first days of spring.
look at her.
she's in her early may, I'd say.
that's the ticket.
now invite her to join you in the back.
perhaps she wants to play doctor.
attention shoppers, it's ten minutes to 11: 00, and that means the sunfair market will be closing in ten minutes.
comes the dawn.
finally figured it out, eh?
Yeah.
Yes.
it's the butcher.
let you in on a secret.
I'm not at all sure how I feel about this 21st century.
the girls I want to ravage, seems they only want to go to female physicians.
no matter how long or loud I whisper to a female physician
well, suffice it to say listening is not something they seem much interested in.
maybe it's what you're whispering.
maybe. No accounting for taste.
nonetheless...
clearly, it's incumbent upon me to adapt or die.
well, not die.
anyway,
I've been whispering in my butcher friend's ear for months.
when I first found him,
I thought I could talk him into going to medical school, but he really doesn't have the book smarts to become a physician.
just sensitive and suggestible in the ways that matter most.
and he's good with his hands.
skilled with a blade.
the truly important things.
it was never gonna be Todd's father, was it?
I sensed you were onto me
you and your dreams of butchers and fresh, frozen females.
had to do something to throw you off the scent.
and what a brilliant stroke of luck.
your little girl's sweetheart has a father who is a doctor.
I hate you!
I appreciate that.
it's a little after 9: 00. I really should be running.
and you should wake up now.
guard!
someone!
I need to call detective Lee Scanlon!
please!
there's my dad.
thanks a lot for coming at the last minute like that.
and you tell your dad that I appreciate him picking you up. All right?
I hope everything works out.
me, too.
what are you doing up?
daddy, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to make trouble, but I didn't think anything bad was gonna happen.
I know, sweetheart.
but sneaking off without telling us, tricking mommy and daddy like that...
it wasn't my idea, you know.
it doesn't matter. What difference does it make which of your friends thought it?
the point is... - it wasn't one of my friends.
it was the new librarian.
wait a second. What?
at school, the new librarian.
Ariel, an adult, a member of the school faculty told you to lie and sneak off to a party?
does this librarian have a name?
I don't know, actually. He didn't say.
but he had an English accent.
english accent?
okay.
and... and you know what was weird?
he was at the party, too.
he was at the party?
and he told me to hide, cause mom was looking for me.
Ariel, wait a second.
how does this guy even know what mommy looks like?
I don't know.
but he's the reason that I walked into the door.
I was following him, and it was so weird. He must've closed it behind him.
but he couldn't have, because I was right behind him.
Ariel, hold on.
I don't understand, sweetie. Explain that to me again.
it was like he walked through the glass or something.
like a ghost out of a movie.
Scanlon here.
detective, hi. Uh...
I'm glad I caught you. This is Joe Dubois, Allison's husband.
Hi. What can I do for you?
I know this is gonna sound kind of nutty, but is there any way that I could talk to my wife?
I'm running out of time!
not much of a signal down here.
it's your husband.
you know, you have one very excitable family.
it's a little cold in here, doctor.
I got to tell you, this is about the strangest place I've ever done anything like this.
you sure you don't want to go to a bar first?
a little alcohol wouldn't hurt anything, if you know what I mean.
I mean, I don't need a white tile room to play doctor.
I can do just fine in the dark.
come on now. Have you seen her?
have you looked at her? This is the greatest moment of your life.
is this gonna hurt, doctor?
she wants some doctoring, my friend.
she needs some doctoring.
don't keep the young woman waiting. She's cold.
they're lovely when they're cold.
little river of blood, making its way across their flushed skin.
really, this is going to be the greatest moment of your life.
a nice clean cut, mate.
remember, this is the greatest moment of your life.
Phoenix police! Drop the knife!
sir, you get any closer to the girl with that knife, and I will fire.
and trust me, my bullet will travel a lot faster than your arm.
do it!
sir, lower the knife.
tear her! Do it!
lower the knife.
what are you doing?
don't listen to him!
sir, I'm gonna count to three. If you don't drop the weapon...
put it in her!
Pierce her, damn it! Rip her apart!
go ahead, put on your clothes.
Wounderful
I need an ambulance at sunfair market.
are you happy? You ruined it.
sir, you're under arrest.
you ruined everything.
turn around.
wonderful. A butcher with a bad arm. - You have the right to remain silent.
a hysterical, fully dressed girl. - Anything you say, can and will...
you have the right to counsel. - Stop crying! Nothing happened!
if you are unable to obtain counsel, counsel will be appointed for you.
if you choose to answer questions without an attorney present...
you people. pathetic.
Mrs. Allison Dubois?
thank you.
here, your honor.
do you understand the charges against you, Mrs. Dubois?
I do, your honor.
state have a bail recommendation?
begging the court's indulgence, your honor.
but I just came from a conference with the complainant.
your honor, I'm happy to report that once Dr. Gromada was made aware that this was nothing more than a case of mistaken identity on Mrs. Dubois' part, made in her capacity as an employee of my office, and that a young woman's life was saved as a result of her efforts, the good doctor has agreed to drop all charges.
very well.
if that's the situation, I'm not one to make more work for this court.
case dismissed.
you're free to go, Mrs. Dubois.
thank you.
no TV for a month. - Okay.
no phone privileges. - All right.
and no time on the computer unless it's specifically homework related.
but... okay.
I'm sorry, mom.
I know you are.
is anything gonna happen to the man in the library?
he isn't there anymore.
and if you ever see him again, if he ever tries to talk to you, you ignore him and you tell me right away, okay?
okay.
and, Ariel, I want you to know that I am going to call Todd's dad tomorrow, and I'm gonna personally apologize.
it's okay;
he was talking to this seventh-grade girl today-- Julie.
Oh, wow.
it sounds like I roughed up the wrong Gromada in that house.
I love you, mom.
I love you, Ariel.
now let's get some sleep.
okay.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
mom, next me can I pour the milk?
we'll see, sweetie.
you have to be able to get it in the bowl.
Ariel... -I can do that.
I pour good.
you don't pour good, you pour well.
okay, so when can I start pouring?
as soon as they get rid of gravity.
first we have to promote you to cereal pouring detail.
I'm getting a promotion?
starting tomorrow. We'll start with the cereal, we'll see how it goes. Then we'll think about milk.
I'm getting a promotion!
girls, keep it down to a dull roar. Your dad's still sleeping.
no, he's not.
aren't you going to have any breakfast?
this is breakfast.
I got out of there ten of 2: 00, and what is it now-- it's 7: 20.
I've got to be back there in 45 minutes.
it's been over a week now like this.
no wonder you're so tired.
they got guys working on this project in their late 20s.
they're out of there, like, 7: 00, 8:00 at night.
they can do the work while talking on their cell phone at the same time that they're checking a blog and e-mailing a friend.
I'm barely 40, and I feel like an antique.
well, that's crazy. You've been there nine years.
you have more experience than anyone else.
Yeah, I cost them more than anyone else, too.
I just... I can't shake the feeling that this project is some kind of a bake-off.
that when it's all done, the winner is going to get a pat on the back, the loser's going to get shown out the door.
what do you mean loser?
it's a project, not a contest.
how do you know?
I don't know.
well, okay then. I work there. I do.
I feel like I never see you.
that's because you never do see me.
I don't get a kiss?
huh?
nothing. I'll see you tonight, or whenever.
sir? -Yep.
I have those parole applications you asked me to take a look at.
great. Anything in there jump out at you?
not really.
just a collection of horrible human beings looking for a little mercy despite the fact that they had none for their victims.
Yeah, today is the day. Parole board hearings. Yahoo.
nothing like spending time in a concrete bunker listening to a bunch of vermin swear that they've seen the light, found the way, and if only you'll let them out into society they'll cure cancer and make the world safe for old ladies and orphans.
care to come with?
is there a problem?
Oh, no. I just have to pick up my girls from school.
Joe's been working crazy hours on this project.
that shouldn't be a problem. This will only take a couple hours.
so how does this work?
it's pretty cut and dried. The prisoner is announced by the parole board.
he's given an opportunity to make his statement-- express remorse for his crimes.
once the board has her his request, they'll ask if we have any objections.
tell us about the crime you committed, Mr. Cosgrove.
I shot my wife.
you shot her 16 times, Mr. Cosgrove, in the back.
you killed her.
what the board needs to determine at this time is do you regret that you committed this crime?
I do, sir. I regret it every day of my life.
I'm a very different man from the one who arrived here ten years ago.
I work hard to be a better person. I gave my life over to the lord.
would the state care to comment?
due to the heinous nature of this crime, as well as to the fact that, to my recollection, this prisoner has never shown any remorse before this hearing, the state would ask that parole be denied at this time.
the board is inclined to agree. Parole is denied.
don't worry, just one more to go.
the board will now consider the petition of Mr. Sam Elkin.
you've served five years of a life sentence, and this is the first time you've been eligible to appear before the parole board, correct?
Yes, sir. That's correct, sir.
tell us about your crime, Mr. Elkin.
Mr. Elkin?
you know what I did.
it's important that we hear it from you.
I guess I kidnapped my girlfriend...
my ex-girlfriend.
we broke up about a month before...
she broke up-- it was her idea.
I wait for her in her car. I had a key.
she used to let me use it. Anyway, I waited for her.
I knew she'd be going out. It was Tuesday.
she always went out on Tuesdays.
I forced her to drive out into the desert.
and once we were there, we... we did it.
I... I made her do it.
when we were done, I just, uh, started choking her.
she was tiny. It didn't take long.
it was almost morning by then, so I drove her car back into the city with her dead body in the passenger seat.
pulled into a busy car wash on Bell road.
the kind with two lanes-- one where they clean the inside, and an express where the car just goes through unattended and they clean the outside.
once the car was inside the wash, I, uh, just turned and walked away.
that's what you needed to hear, right?
it's my understanding that until you became eligible for parole this month, you repeatedly denied committing any of these crimes.
uh, yes, sir.
and I regret that, sir.
Mr. District attorney?
while I am moved to finally hear Mr. Elkin admit to these heinous acts,
I can't help but be suspicious of his motives.
Mr. Elkin is, after all, well aware that taking responsibility for his crimes is a condition of his parole eligibility.
perhaps his apology and remorse will carry more weight when he has another five years to sleep on them.
Hello?
I'm lonely.
Hi, lonely. My name's Joe.
so what do you think? What are the chances i'll see you before today becomes tomorrow?
uh, you wouldn't happen to know what the temperature in hell is, would you?
you haven't heard anything about a big freeze, maybe?
they didn't mention it on the news, no.
Mm. Then I'm probably going to be here for a while.
talk to me. Tell me about your day.
I sat in on a parole hearing today.
heard this guy confess that he killed his girlfriend.
I got this strong feeling that he didn't do it.
And?
and I just had a dream about him kissing this woman.
the dead girlfriend? -Someone else.
you know what I think? I think you've got kissing on the brain.
no one's kissed me on the brain, or anywhere else for that matter, for quite some time.
Oops.
I think break time is over.
love you, too. -Love you, three.
whatever you want, you're going to have to do it yourself.
not funny.
when did you get in?
I don't know. I couldn't bear to look at the clock.
I really have to get some sleep.
I just found out the client's coming in tomorrow at 3: 00 for an update.
Oh, crap. -What?
did we ever get my suit pants fixed after the cuff came unraveled at Christmas?
"we"? If by "we,"you really mean "me," then no.
"we" didn't know about your cuff.
okay, forget it. I'll wear shorts and a t-shirt.
I can go straight from the meeting to unemployment and then directly to the car wash to look for a job.
hey... there is a tailor who works at the mall by city hall who does alterations while you wait.
I can drop them off first thing and pick them up at lunch.
on second thought, bring those brains of yours over here.
I think I do feel like kissing them.
no, I just felt him there, and he was standing over my bed, just looming there.
and then he leaned down... and then he kissed me.
you'd better not be playing solitaire on that computer.
it's almost 2: 00. You're cutting it close.
you're welcome.
I'm sorry. There was a thank you in there. You just didn't hear it.
well, you're right. I'm running late.
the strangest thing happened to me on the way over here.
I saw this woman.
she looked just like that girl I've been seeing in my dreams--the one who keeps getting kissed?
she was going up an escalator. I was going down.
geez.
there's no reason some stranger in a mall should be getting all the action.
I'm sorry i haven't been around. Thank you for lunch.
you tip all the delivery people that way, or was that special for me?
forgive me, Mr. Dubois.
I just wanted to remind you we're going to be leaving in approximately 30 minutes.
I'm all over it, Edrick.
I'm just going to grab a bite to eat, and then I'm going to change.
Edrick, this is my wife, Allison. Allison, this is edrick, who is single-handedly making it tough for mere mortals like me to have to work anything less than a 24-hour day.
I need your help...
first generation American.
my parents didn't speak much English when I was born, but they loved Mmerican names.
couldn't decide between Ed and Rick.
nice meeting you, Mrs. Dubois.
thirty... -minutes.
I'm counting the seconds.
the Elkin case?
Sam Elkin? Why would you want to revisit the elkin case?
it's five years old. The case is closed. The accused man confessed.
call me old-fashioned, but if you want to revisit old cases,
I'd certainly prefer that you find one that's unsolved and where the guilty party isn't already behind bars.
I told you yesterday I felt strongly I'm start to regret taking you to come with. Tat. D I told you yesterday i complete agree.
he was lying...about feeling badly, about being filled with remorse, about his supposed concern for Amanda Crane's friends and family.
I have court. -Mr. District attorney...
Allison, look at the coroner's report. -I did.
then you know that Elkin's sperm was still inside the victim when we recovered her body.
there's got to be something more than just your sense that this man wasn't being truthful.
I've been having this dream...
this womam is not the victim-- she's lying in bed in the dark.
her lover comes up and steals a kiss.
sounds romantic.
up until last night, the man had no face.
now I see it's sam Elkin.
I'm not sure I know what that means.
I'm not sure I know what it means, either, but I actually saw this woman today, a block away from here at the mall.
seems to me there must be some reason i'm dreaming these dreams, some reason I met Elkin yesterday, some reason I crossed paths with this woman today.
go talk to Scanlon. If the two of you can find something in the file worth looking at...
thank you.
excuse me, uh, I'm looking for detective Lee Scanlon.
that's his desk over there. Must have stepped out for a second.
excuse me.
uh, you look a bit upset. My name's, uh, Allison Bubois.
I work with the district attorney's office.
I was wondering if I can be of some kind of help to you.
I don't know.
I've been waiting to see a detective since early this morning.
I came here with a friend. We waited for an hour and a half, then they told us to go away for an hour. So we took a walk around the mall, came back.
then they said it would be another two to three hours.
my friend finally had to leave. I'm missing a day's work.
you know what? I work with one of the detectives here.
let me see if I can't get him to talk to you.
Oh, thanks. That would be great.
I'm sorry, miss...?
kathleen Walsh. I'm not married.
Mrs. Dubois explained you've been waiting a long while. What can we help you with?
well, I should tell you, I called the police yesterday morning.
they came by my house, but...
start from the beginning. Tell us what happened.
six months ago, I moved to Phoenix just before the start of the school year. I teach music.
anyway, I found this wonderful apartment for very little money.
but shortly after i settled in, I began to hear noises...
only at night.
they'd start just as I was getting ready for bed.
do you have any pets?
a cat-- Boots.
but I've had him, like, forever. He doesn't make these sounds.
okay, so you heard there sounds...
Yeah. I would call out, but no one would answer.
uh, this would happen...like, three, maybe four times a week.
so what'd you do?
I didn't think that there was anything to do.
I wasn't certain that there was anything really there...
so frankly, for a long time, I did nothing.
but then the noises started to change.
what do you mean? Change how?
well, there was this clicking sound.
clicking?
a camera. -Huh?
I was wondering if you thought it sounded like a camera.
um... I don't know.
okay. Whatever it was, there's this new sound.
and I ignored that for a while, too.
but then two nights ago...
I felt him there...close.
he was standing over the bed.
forgive me for asking, but how do you know that? How do you know he was there?
stand up.
excuse me?
would you stand up, please?
close your eyes.
any questions?
no.
and then?
he kissed me.
so what'd you do?
I screamed.
and then he was gone.
and then I called the police, and then the police came over. And then-
I have no way of proving this...
but I think they laughed at me.
whoa, hold it, you're... I want to make sure I've got this right.
you're not alleging that this guy raped you, struck you, fondled you?
a man broke into my apartment...
and he kissed me.
miss Walsh...
you're going to tell me to change the locks, move in with a friend...
buy a big dog?
can I see you, Allison, uh...in private for one second?
what are you doing to me? -What am I doing to you?
shouldn't the question be what are you gonna do for that woman?
uh, no. I don't think so.
what is your problem? She's clearly being victimized.
she came to you for help.
victimized?
a man keeps breaking into her apartment.
maybe. -No. Not maybe.
based on what she's telling me, the police who went into her apartment couldn't find any evidence of a break in.
and obviously, there's no witnesses. -She is a witness.
I don't think so. To what?
to the breaking and entering.
well it doesn't actually appear as though there was any breaking.
which would lead me to suspect that there probably wasn't any real entering, either.
so what do you want me to do?
protect her. -From what?
this dangerous band of marauders and thieves who may have broken into her place and stolen, what, a kiss?
what are you so hot about? You don't even know this lady?
didn't you just tell me you met her ten minutes ago?
I know what she's telling us is true-- I saw it.
Oh, you were there?
and I saw something else, too.
a man who's serving a life sentence for a murder that i don't think he did, he was the person doing the kissing.
you're not making much sense, if the guy's still in prison.
I know, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me either.
what do you want me to do, Allison?
miss. Walsh...you ever heard of a man named Sam Elkin?
no. Doesn't ring a bell. Why?
uh, never mind. No big deal.
I've conferred with Mrs. Dubois here and we've decided to post a visible police presence right outside your building.
they'll be there 24 hours a day, and if anyone comes in or out, they'll see it.
additionally, we'll set up a direct phone link to your apartment.
if anyone does come in, you just pick up that phone and we're there.
Wow. That's great.
I was just hoping that maybe you could send someone over to take a second look.
Really?
I wouldn't hear of it.
this kissing thing, that's not something i want to play around with.
well, thank you.
and thank you, Mrs. Dubois.
Oh, no, it's nothing. That's what we're here for.
Absolutely. That is what we're here for.
Hello?
Hello?
are you here?
are you watching me?
Hey.
you're home, and it's not even 12: 00.
will wonders never cease?
you'd almost think that I lived here.
I missed you.
I hate waking up and having dreams and not having you to share them with.
well, good.
because I suspect that pretty soon, not only will I be around during the middle of the night, but quite possibly during the day, as well.
what are you talking about?
well, we went to see the client today, and it's like I was invisible.
nobody really wanted to hear from me.
it was the Edrick show. All day, all the time.
you know, the guy's been an engineer for 15 minutes, but it's like he's Galileo the way they hang on his every word.
honey...
and not just...not just the client, but the senior guys from our firm, as well.
I know that.
I used to get that look.
that's the "you're the future of this company" look.
hmm, I think you're exaggerating. I met Edrick.
he bows at your feet. He worships you.
he's got me lined up in his crosshairs.
he covets my parking space.
he lusts after the senior vice president nameplate on my office door.
he pines for my four extra vacation days a year.
and you know what the surprising part is
I don't think i really give a damn.
it's good to be home.
and you?
any more kissing dreams?
mm, the kissing has stopped. There is no kissing.
no real clarity, either.
interview Elkin again?
whatever for? -I've been having these dreams.
all of them are very similar.
up until last night, I thought they were about this blind woman, Kathleen Walsh, being kissed by a man who has no features, being kissed by Sam Elkin.
but then last night, I had the same dream, set in the same place, but Kathleen is gone.
Elkin's dead girlfriend, Amanda Crane, is in her place.
and this suggests?
I don't know, but I'd like to try and find out.
I don't have it, and I couldn't do it.
I left here at 10: 30 last night.
no matter how much I try, I can't design with my eyes closed.
the drawings, the silicone diode-- I don't have them, I'm still working on them.
sorry, kid.
I need your help.
excuse me?
all my work.
I sent it down to qc, double-check the specs.
none of it checked out.
the quality control guys called it gibberish.
it's only a matter of time before everyone upstairs hears about it.
I need your help, Mr. Dubois.
so what'd I do?
well, that's what I was hoping to figure out.
I don't know if you remember me. My name's Allison Dubois.
I work with the district attorney's office.
I was here for your parole hearing the other day. Sat right over there.
you waiting for a thank you?
it's gonna be a long wait.
well, no, I'm not here for a thank you.
I'd just like to get some questions answered.
well, I don't know. Depends on the questions.
I mean, what's in it for me?
looks like I'm gonna be in here the rest of my life.
I'm not what you'd call highly incentivized.
okay, well, let's start with an easy one then.
why did you sit there the other day and plead forgiveness for a crime that you didn't commit?
I mean, I know your lawyer must have told you your only chance of parole was for you to come in and sit there and tell the board what they wanted to hear, but I'm here to tell you, I strongly suspect that you did not commit that crime.
now, I'm not on the board, and I'm with the district attorney's office, but I'm no attorney, so I can't really promise you anything.
but if you have a story to tell, I would like to hear it.
and if I believe you,
I will do everything I can to be sure that everyone listens.
I loved Amanda Crane.
she was a college girl, I was a guy who fixed cars.
her friends didn't think much of me.
her family didn't think much of me.
but I loved her.
we went together for months.
used to spend almost every day together.
every day except Tuesdays.
at first, she was always coming up with excuses.
I have a test, I have a paper due.
then she switched her story on me.
said she had a job, she had to work.
didn't really bother me at first.
didn't think much of it.
then I lost my wallet one night, had no money to get home.
I went over to her dorm, she wasn't there.
it was 3: 00 in the morning.
next day she tells me she was working all night.
"doing what?" I said.
that's when things started to get strange.
for a while, she wouldn't tell me, but I wouldn't let it go.
I was like a dog with a bone.
finally, one night, she tells me.
she met a man.
he offered to pay her way through school.
all she had to do was go over to this apartment he owned.
when she gets inside, she puts on a blindfold, spends the night.
and do what? -Exactly.
that's what I wanted to know.
she swears to me, she's not doing anything.
she just puts on a blindfold, takes off her clothes, puts on a nightgown, goes to bed.
got up the next morning, put her clothes back on, took the blindfold off, and walked out the door.
and that was it?
so she said.
I asked her if he was there.
she said she supposed so, but she never heard him, never felt him, never sensed he was there.
I didn't believe her at first.
I used to drop her off a couple of blocks away. She'd let me use the car.
then one night, I followed her.
she caught me before she got there.
she was furious.
we had a huge fight, broke up.
I'd call her, she wouldn't answer.
I'd go over to her dorm, she wouldn't let me in.
that's when she got the restraining order.
I stayed away for a month, but then I couldn't take it any longer.
I went over to her dorm.
damn near busted the door down.
her roommate threatened to call the cops, but Amanda finally let me in.
roommate took off, and we had another huge fight and then, a huge cry...
and then, we made love.
I told her I was going to find a way to pay for school.
I was going to do it.
she told me she loved me, she missed me.
she was going to quit. She was going to find a way to tell that guy that night.
that was the last time i saw her.
next thing I know, they found her car at that car wash.
my DNA was everywhere. It was inside the car, inside her.
I told them my story, but no one believed me.
ma'am?
what are you thinking?
I was thinking, have you ever met Kathleen Walsh?
no, I don't think so. What does she look like?
I'm thinking she looks a lot like this guy's next victim.
so what you are saying is that there's this man who likes to watch women sleep?
I'm not going to even pretend to know what he likes.
you think this is the guy who's been sneaking into your friend Kathleen's apartment?
well, she's not my friend, but yes, what I'm saying is i feel very strongly the man who's been watching kathleen is the same man who was watching Elkin's girlfriend, Amanda, and very well may have been responsible for her death.
you know, when I was preparing for Elkin's parole hearing, I remember reading his statement.
this crazy story about his girlfriend having a job, only he didn't know where, and he didn't know with whom.
I know, it sounds so bizarre. -Bizarre?
no, it aspires to "bizarre."
Allison, this man's sperm was still inside her when they found the body.
Yeah, they made up the night before. He went by her dorm. Her roommate saw him.
precisely, he was in violation of the restraining order she took out against him.
not exactly the kind of thing you want to put in front of a judge in hopes of reopening a case.
what if we could catch him?
you lost me.
well, we know he likes Kathleen.
so what if we can remove the visible police presence outside the building, the squad car, the patrolman?
are you suggesting that we use this woman as bait?
we might be able to do it safely. Wire the place up so we could hear everything, hide a bunch of swat guys.
we're already providing round- the-clock police protection against an intruder i'm not convinced even exists!
now we're talking about spending more of the taxpayer's money to catch someone you think might have committed a five-year-old murder, for which we already have someone in prison?
doesn't matter-- won't work unless Kathleen Walsh agrees to stay in that apartment without a police car standing watch outside her building.
which I'm guessing might be a tough sell.
well, can't we at least ask her?
it's 11 minutes past 8: 00. She might not have left for work yet.
it's up to you.
hello.
ms. Walsh, this is district attorney Devalos.
I'm sorry to bother you so early in the morning, but we think we may have developed a significant lead in your case, and I was wondering if I might be able to persuade you to let us pull the police presence in front of your building for several nights in hopes of drawing the suspect out.
obviously, we would install other safety measures.
last night was the first good night's sleep i've had in months.
I can't tell you what it was like to get into bed and know I was alone.
know I was alone.
Hey, where you going? -I got to call Scanlon.
Yeah. -He's in the apartment.
I don't know how he got in there, but...
are you talking about Kathleen Walsh's place?
I got a cop and a cop car sitting in front of her building, trust me.
I'm telling you, he can get past them.
we changed the locks on every door, and checked the latches on all her windows.
it doesn't matter.
Allison, what you're saying doesn't make any sense.
please! You have a man right there. Can't you send him up?
it's 2: 00 in the morning, Allison.
all right, I'll send someone up there. I'll call you right back.
I'm not sure how I feel about you calling strange men at 2: 00 in the morning.
I'm worried, Joe. I got a bad feeling.
that's good enough for me.
you were right about Edrick, by the way.
what do you mean? Did he fall to his knees, beg for mercy?
pretty damn close.
two officers went up, Allison. They checked the whole place.
no one was in there, and no one was getting in there,
I mean, except for one fairly cheesed-off blind lady, who said she was enjoying the best night's sleep she'd had in months.
Really?
but I don't understand.
no offense, Allison, but it's 2: 00 in the morning.
you, me, and Devalos are supposed to meet at 8: 00 A. M.
would it be okay if we chatted then?
sure.
now you're suggesting we use this woman as bait?
well, we know he likes Kathleen, so maybe we could remove some of the visible police presence around the building, the car sitting there, the patrolman?
okay...
what do you want me to say?
well, I don't know. Last night, I convinced myself that you thought it was a good idea.
well... I don't know what to tell you.
Allison, be realistic.
after you convinced detective scanlon to send the police charging into this woman's apartment at 2: 00 in the morning, the other tenants in the building, who are already up in arms about being stopped every time they come in and go out, have had it up to here.
not to mention what it's costing the department keeping personnel there 24-7.
I think we have to pull the plug on this thing.
but, sir, that man was there! I saw him
we were here having a meeting like this...
I have enormous respect for you, but it's 8: 10, and I'm due in the judge's chambers in 20 minutes.
last night, you said it was 8: 11.
last night? What are you talking about?
Hey, I need to use your phone.
hello.
Kathleen, it's Allison.
are you standing in your kitchen wearing your bathrobe holding a cup of hot coffee?
well, no.
now I'm making my way into the living room, wearing my bathrobe, holding a cup of hot coffee.
Kathleen, I need you to stay calm and do exactly as I say.
take that hot coffee you're holding and throw it over your right shoulder.
this is detective Scanlon. I need you to get up there now. Enter Kathleen Walsh's apartment, weapons drawn.
Kathleen, do it now-- he's right behind you!
mom, don't be ridiculous.
No!
police! Release that woman, and put your hands in the air!
we got him, then you're right.
I want to thank you for your bravery.
and I would also like to apologize for the initial skepticism that came from this office.
apology accepted.
turns out your tormentor was also your neighbor.
it seems your apartment and his were originally designed as a single unit.
Mr. Christopher Russo and his mother lived there until the early '90s, when his mother passed on, and he decided to turn it into two apartments.
your living room closet shares a common wall with one in his bedroom.
he finally confessed to everything last night from his hospital bed.
he hired Amanda Crane five years ago.
when she told him that the arrangement no longer worked for her, he told her he had pictures of her.
she threatened to call the police. They fought; he strangled her.
he claims to have been so horrified by the act of killing amanda, that he completely swore off having anything to do with the opposite sex.
started renting the apartment and completely forgot about the common closet.
then, you came along, a beautiful tenant with a built-in blindfold, and his old compulsions just took over.
well, I'm just happy to know he's behind bars.
which reminds me, there is someone who would very much like to meet you.
this is Sam Elkin.
it's very nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, Sam.
I've never slept with an executive senior vice president before.
five extra vacation days a year.
very impressive.
so what did Edrick have to say about it?
he was upset, but i explained to him, with age comes experience, and with experience comes wisdom.
and what comes with wisdom?
with any luck...
dear Allison, I went to see you again today.
guess I just had to have another look.
a closer look.
and God, you were beautiful.
like an angel." "You really are.
those pictures of you in the paper don't do you justice.
but it was worth it.
because this time, I know you felt me, too.
of course you would have to be this pretty,
because what you do, the things you see are so ugly, are so unnatural.
Oh, the devil is always the prettiest girl or the best-dressed man at the party.
there is a natural order to things.
it is God's pattern, and you break that pattern when you offer your supposed wisdom
which you derive from things no mortal is meant to see!
I read about you, and wonder:
do you even understand what a disruption you are to the natural order?
do you even know that you're an instrument of evil?
or does the devil exploit your stupidity and somehow convince you that you are on the side of the angels,
when in fact, you are Beelzebub, Allison Dubois.
and so, I entreat you, devil-woman... stop.
stop what you're doing.
it can't be allowed to continue. I can't let it continue.
you have to be stopped.
please stop...
or I will stop you!
should we keep this one?
Nope. Recycle.
keep?
Yes, we definitely have to keep this. This is the electric bill.
something's wrong here.
what's the matter, Bridge?
where the heck are the comics in this paper?
I've flipped through it twice, but they're not here.
I mean, I think someone left them out.
no one left them out. There's no comics in that paper. That's not that kind of paper.
what are you talking about?
every paper has to have a comic.
I mean, why else would anyone read it?
Ariel's right, Bridge.
that's a financial paper. It doesn't have any comics in it.
nothing to make you laugh, nothing to make you smile.
nothing but bad news about stocks and 401K plans.
what's a four-oh-one k plan?
about half of what it used to be. Hey, look at this.
your daughter's cutting stuff out of the paper again.
Oh, sweetie, you have to use the old newspapers for your paper dolls.
sorry, Mommy. - It's okay.
keep?
uh, yes, honey.
mommy needs to keep this one.
the thought of hurting you fills me with profound sorrow.
you have to be stopped. Please stop, or I will stop you!
underline, exclamation point, exclamation point.
conveniently unsigned. Quite the fan of excessive punctuation.
it came in the mail this morning to my house.
how concerned should I be?
this is about five years worth, and, uh... this is one of my favorites.
whore of Satan, like the pig you are?
great. It even rhymes.
I get about one of these a month.
they come from the relatives of men that I sent to prison.
I get them from people who dislike having a Latino district attorney.
and from some people, I get them because they hate, just for hate's sake.
but at the end of the day, they all have one thing in common.
what's that?
none of the threats ever amounts to anything.
wait. So, you just put them in that drawer and do nothing?
actually... yes.
sorry I'm late, Terry.
Oh, I called you on the spur of the moment. I understand.
don't do that.
you're here to listen, not eat.
you read the papers? The financial press?
uh...uh, it's funny you should mention that.
no. There's nothing funny about it.
you are R & D guys. Your heads are always in the future.
problem is, business is done in the here and now.
it's about things you can see, hold in your hand. Things you can sell today.
not things in your head, things in your imagination. Things that don't exist yet.
anyway, if you read the papers, you know that the here and now is pretty damn bleak.
and that includes Cavanaugh Industries.
how bleak is bleak?
bleak enough for me to ask you to take a hard look at your operation, Joe.
are we talking, uh, resources or people?
I'm telling you to cut whatever's cutable.
look, Joe, without a fairly substantial cash infusion,
Cavanaugh Industries is going to have to become a much leaner place.
we're going to have to do 100% of the work with only half of the money and manpower.
the key phrase being, without a cash infusion.
and that's why I've asked you to meet me today. I...need a favor.
I'm contemplating a stock purchase.
a rather large stock purchase.
you've heard of Richter-Mullis?
Yeah, that's a defense contractor, right?
rumor is, they're about to be awarded a couple of huge government contracts.
I got people telling me it's a sure thing.
I also got people telling me not to go near it with a ten-foot pole.
it's more of a gamble than I'm accustomed to.
I need some advice on which way to jump.
wow, Terry. Uh...Markets and finances-- that's really not something that I know a lot about.
from your wife, Joe.
we don't have a name. Looks to be about 17.
found in an abandoned apartment building in Paradise Plains.
the building owner figured her for a junkie who broke in, got high, then fell down the stairs.
apparently, it's happened before.
I take it the coroner doesn't agree.
no. There's no needle marks.
and the bruising to her face, the trauma to the skull-- none of that's consistent with a fall.
he feels pretty strongly that this girl was beaten to death.
do we have a clue as to who this girl might be?
no, not yet. No reports of a missing girl matching her description.
no matches on her prints or DNA...
what would you say if I told you that I think she was gassed?
I think someone subdued her using some kind of mask attached to a canister.
is there any way that... that you could test that?
is it possible that she could still have some gas left in her lungs?
Ariel, I'm on my way. Is Daddy home yet?
Well...Well, I don't know what to tell you, honey.
I can't make dinner till I'm home, and I'm not home yet, so...
well, why don't you guys order a pizza?
okay, there's a...there's a coupon on the refrigerator door, and then just go into Daddy's sock drawer.
on the left-hand side, there's an envelope with a bunch of money in it.
but don't bother memorizing the hiding place, 'cause we're gonna change it tonight.
what now? Honey? Honey?
I-I'm gonna have to go. I got to call the motor club.
I'm having a little bit of a car problem, so I'm gonna have to pull over.
okay.
motor club. Motor club.
that was lucky. I hadn't even finished dialing the motor club.
I was headed back from a job when I saw your smoke signal there.
I can tow you to the nearest station, if you like.
you can call it in while I hook you up to the rig.
that would be great. Thanks.
your call is important to us. Please hold.
all set. Still on hold?
I'll just radio it in while we're on the way to the gas station.
here. Get on in.
uh...no, no, no, no. I think I'd rather... I'd rather not.
is something the matter, ma'am?
uh, no. No, no, no. I just, uh...I just changed my mind.
um, I think I'm just going to wait here till my...my husband gets here.
if you wouldn't mind just, uh...
just unhooking my car?
actually, that makes almost no sense.
the, uh...Well, the hard part is already done.
why don't you hop in, let me drive you to the nearest gas station?
you can call your husband and have him meet you there.
come on now, Miss.
the faster you get in, the faster you can get your car fixed, the faster you get back to your family.
my family?
how do...How do you even know I have a family?
you already talked about your husband, and I can see your child's car seat in the back of your car.
just-just unhook my car.
I'll do whatever you want, but it's a short drive to the station.
the motor club'll cover it, if that's what you're worried about.
unhook my car, or I'm going to scream.
miss, please. - Unhook my car. Unhook my car!
help! Help me!
you all right? Everything all right? - Yeah, we're just fine.
lady wants me to unhook her car, and that's what I'm about to do.
is that all right? Lady, are you okay?
Yeah, please just stay here with me, please. Please.
okay.
look, if this tow truck driver is in fact the man who wrote you those threatening letters, we're certainly not gonna have a difficult time finding him.
Scanlon's on his way over to the towing company right now.
but I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I'm a bit skeptical.
I mean, it does not make a whole lot of sense for someone who means to do you harm to come after you in a vehicle emblazoned with his name and phone number.
you don't understand.
I saw this man's hand.
he had the exact same tattoo as the man from my dream.
I even saw red ink on his fingers.
again, a lot of people have red pens.
and the tattoo you're describing-- well, it...
it might be uncommon, but it's hardly unique.
what you're saying makes sense, and I'd love to jump on the bandwagon and tell my wife that she's got nothing to worry about, but I just got off the phone with the service station where we dropped the car off.
the mechanic there said it's the water pump drive belt that's broken.
actually, he said it wasn't broken at all.
it wasn't even worn out.
he said it had...it had been cut.
that man knew where I was parking in the municipal garage. He cut that belt.
then he followed me till my car overheated.
excuse me. - We have to do something.
Yeah, Lee.
so, here's the thing.
I contacted Ready Set Go Towing.
the driver of the truck's a guy named Lucas Harvey.
I'm at his place right now.
so what does he have to say for himself?
not much. He's not here.
but I think you're going to want to get a look at this place.
okay. I'm at Allison's.
uh, give me an address, we'll head right over.
I wouldn't do that. It should really just be you alone.
you sure?
Oh, yeah, I'm positive.
good God Almighty.
toothbrush is gone, dresser drawers are empty.
we just put an APB out on him.
this is...stunning.
well, it gets worse.
he's got a little magazine rack in the bathroom.
this was in there along with all the porn.
he's got it all here.
when school starts, when school gets out.
clubs they go to, friends' houses.
pretty complete dossier on each of the girls.
okay.
I need to get back to the Dubois house, talk them through this.
get some men to follow me over.
I want a detail on that house 24 hours a day until we find this lunatic.
Yeah.
I wouldn't rush to get dressed for school today.
I think there's something going on.
Hello? - Joe? Is that you?
Terry, hi.
uh, Terry, hold on one second.
let me get someplace, uh, private and quiet where we can talk.
God, you're harder to find than a whore in church.
called your office, called your cell...
sorry, sorry, uh, it's... it's been crazy around here today.
so, what's the verdict on Richter-Mullis?
uh, excuse me?
what did your wife say about the stock?
Joe? Did I lose you?
no, I'm here.
um, Terry...I-I haven't had a chance to ask her about it yet.
like I say, it's been, um, it's been a crazy day around here.
when do you think this is going to happen?
tonight. Um, I'll make sure it happens tonight.
just stopped by to see how my favorite shut-ins are doing.
so, basically you have no news?
well... No, not yet.
look, the guy's gotta eat.
he's gotta get a room somewhere, he's got to make a cell phone call and soon as he does, soon as he flips that thing on, soon as he pulls out a credit card this whole thing is over.
how do we know that he isn't camping out somewhere?
how do we know he hasn't brought a whole bunch of food with him?
how do we know he hasn't got one of those, like, disposable cell phones?
we don't.
I don't know, the girls have to go to school. I-I have to go to work.
Joe, come on. We've all known each other for a while.
you gotta believe me when I tell you we're doing everything we can to reel this guy in.
I know the confinement's hard.
I know having officers standing out front's not fun.
but honestly, all we're trying to do here is keep everybody safe.
excuse me, I'm gonna go check on the girls.
I think he's under a lot of pressure from work.
Yeah, I know.
I get it, I really do.
you mind if I change the subject?
no, I wish you would.
the Medical Examiner ran some tests on that 17-year- old Jane Doe from the abandoned apartment complex.
turns out she had a chemical in her system called Isoflurane.
I'm sorry, I don't know what that is.
it's a knock-out gas normally used to prep patients for surgery.
which means whoever did this to her is either licensed to use this stuff or knows someone who is.
a doctor, anesthesiologist, maybe.
tell Joe, uh...
no, no, no, don't worry. Let me take care of Joe.
Thanks.
Oh, hey, Hannah wants to know if I'm going to school tomorrow.
Hannah wants to know if I'm going...
I don't know yet, honey, I...
well, then, uh, she wants to know then if it would be all right if, uh, she drove by the house in the morning on her way to school to see the police outside?
you know what? I'll just tell her no.
okay. Honey, I'm gonna leave the door open, okay? Sweet dreams.
just call us if you need anything, okay?
okay, I went absolutely nowhere today.
I did absolutely nothing and yet I've never been so tired in my entire life.
I need to ask you a favor.
okay, I got this off the Internet.
and this is an article about them that I found in the, um, in the financial journal that I just started getting.
here, here you go.
okay, let's see. "A small company with big hopes...
and then I can't read it because there's a doll-shaped hole cut in it.
Yeah. Right, I know that but you know, you can still kind of get the gist of it.
all right, I'm reading.
now, I'm reading...Now I know everything that anyone who read this knows.
maybe less, 'cause I don't really understand this stuff.
What's...What is the point?
well, the point is, he wants your opinion.
isn't he the man who mocked me a month ago?
Yes, but he's also the man that pays me each week.
okay.
you know what, honey? This is ridiculous. It doesn't work this way.
I don't work this way, you know that.
no, I don't know how it works.
I don't know what you're going to dream about tonight. Neither do you.
who knows, maybe if you, if you look at this stuff it'll...
I wouldn't get my hopes up. You know I can barely balance our checkbook.
believe me, I know.
promise you, my hopes are down.
you okay?
you want me to call somebody?
sir, do you think some water would help?
morning. - Morning.
heard you were running low on some groceries, so, I thought I'd bring over a couple of things, milk, coffee, doughnuts.
kind of a policeman's breakfast.
cool! I'm starting to think that maybe I want to be a policeman.
policewoman.
there's also a couple things I'd love to fill you in on.
news of this Lucas Harvey guy?
I'm sorry, no.
come on in. - Thanks.
you both should know, we, uh, we've had an all-points bulletin on this fellow for almost 36 hours now.
he is going to be found. - From your lips.
Oh, and by the way, there are people working on bringing you over real groceries.
they should, uh, make a delivery later on today.
more doughnuts?
no, sweetie, we got plenty of doughnuts.
Hey, girls, why don't you, um, offer these gentlemen a doughnut?
sure thing.
this is her; this is the woman I dreamt about.
interesting.
you're dreaming a bit outside our jurisdiction, Allison.
this woman was murdered last night in Scottsdale.
their coroner sent these over.
her name is Cassidy Pearson.
her body was found not an hour and a half ago underneath the bleachers at the local high school.
and did the coroner test her for traces of that gas?
Isoflurane? Same chemical used on our Jane Doe.
your phone call. It's Lucas Harvey.
keep him on the line as long as you can so we can get a trace.
wait. Wait...
Hello? This is Allison. This is Allison Dubois.
and this is Lucas Harvey.
the man of your dreams.
you have dreamt about me, haven't you?
that's how you knew it was me the other night by the side of the road, right?
what do you want?
for now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence;
and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
is that it? Is that what you're calling to tell me?
I've been looking for you to show up at work.
looking for your little girls to show up at school.
Yeah, well, I know a lot of people who have been looking for you, too.
I take no pleasure in this, Mrs. Dubois.
I take no pleasure in hunting down a mother and her babies.
but God has a plan and there's no room in it for prophets. For seers.
you toy with destiny.
you mock the Almighty with your dreaming, with your second sight.
well, I'd like to believe it's God who gave it to me.
I'd like to believe it's the Almighty that gave this to me.
you can believe whatever you like.
but you're wrong. Not that it matters.
I have every confidence that you and the Almighty will be discussing it face to face in a matter of hours anyway.
really, now, who's the prophet now?
Hello, hello?
he was calling from a cell phone at the Arizona Center.
we're still triangulating him, so, I'm assuming he's still making phone calls.
well, get as many units there as you can as quickly as you can.
I'm going to hand you over to someone who can lead you right to him, hang on.
I think maybe we finally caught a break. Thank you.
okay, ready. One, two, three. - One, two, three.
war!
go away, we're warring!
uh, Dad?
the, uh, police guy who's monitoring the phone says that your boss keeps calling and they're trying to keep the phone lines clear in case the crazy guy calls again.
so, he wanted to know, uh, do you mind if they keep giving him the busy signal and he suggested that maybe you want to call him directly from your cell?
no, that's all right, I'll call him later.
one, two, three! You lose!
they found the cell phone that the call was made from.
it was sitting on top of a Bible in the food court at the Arizona Center.
but Lucas Harvey himself was long gone.
that'll be your groceries.
are we expecting someone?
it's groceries.
couldn't figure out if you were a paper or plastic kinda girl.
hope you don't mind, I went old school.
Oh, Bridge, honey, can you show these men where the kitchen is?
and you and Ariel can start putting things away?
all right, that's what I call service.
I wouldn't be too excited. Lucas rvey's gone missing again.
what? - Found his cell phone but not him.
we just have to hope that he calls again and we can pin him down sooner.
Oh, my God.
what if he doesn't?
this guy is all about getting to Allison. There's no way he's just gonna disappear.
he'll make a move. He'll call, he'll show up.
we just have to be ready when he does.
does everybody hear that? - What's that?
water running. I think Marie's playing with the bath again.
okay, four guys, five bucks each.
make sure I get a receipt, will ya?
I thought there were five guys. - There's four.
honey?
it's holy water. To cleanse you with.
you okay?! You hurt?!
it's okay, sweetie.
I feel so guilty.
I brought him here... Me. Into our home.
I exposed our whole family to him.
you didn't bring him anywhere.
he was crazy. Now he's dead.
still...
still what?
you did not bring him here.
for what it's worth, the girls didn't actually see anything.
and the person who did bring him here-- Detective Scanlon-- trust me, based on the look on his face when he left, he's feeling guilty enough for everyone.
what if I just stopped?
stopped what?
stopped dreaming. Stopped seeing things.
I didn't know you could do that.
no, you know what I mean.
what if I just stopped paying attention?
stopped telling anyone.
what if I just pretended it wasn't happening?
I didn't know that you could do that either.
come on, let's just get some sleep.
it's night; we're safe. Lucas Harvey's dead.
the boogey-man has boogied on out of here.
let's get some sleep, okay?
with the close of the bell on Wall Street today, last night's Presidential address about Washington's plans to fix the troubled economy seemed to calm the markets.
there were even a few big winners.
Richter-Mullis's stock shot up sharply on news they had won several large government contracts.
the time is currently 6: 10 p. m. and here's Calleigh Newsome...
excuse me? Uh, sorry to bother you.
you have the time?
no, sorry, not wearing a watch.
Hey, what are you doing?
it's a little after 6: 00. We don't have to get up for another 45 minutes.
but I had a dream.
you are amazing.
last night you swore off everything psychic and then this morning you can't get out here fast enough to write down your dreams.
Hey, you think the paper's here yet?
Why? - Can you grab it for me?
Tooth-Doc1...
I think this guy's a dentist!
the one who keeps gassing these girls!
what, you dreamt about him giving someone a root canal?
no, look at his license plate number.
Tooth-Doc1. That's terrific.
can we go back to sleep now?
Hey, the President give a speech last night?
president Addresses Economy in White House Speech.
you want me to read it to you?
no, no, just that he said it.
because if he said it last night that means that my dentist hasn't killed the girl I've been dreaming about. Not yet.
not until just before sundown today.
Oh, that's it?
Oh, no, actually, you gotta tell your boss to buy that stock.
it's gonna go up today, way up.
wait, you dreamt that, too? This is in the same dream?
Yeah, actually... actually, it was.
Tooth-Doc1, huh?
that'd explain how he had access to Isoflurane.
that's him! - Jeremy Crane. There's his current address.
you know what? I'm gonna head over there now.
with any luck he's still home. We can grab him before he leaves for work.
Hey, remember, if he's not there he's gonna abduct that girl tonight from Benedict Park at sundown.
don't worry, I'll send a couple squad cars over there now.
north and South entrance, we'll stake it out all day.
no, I'm holding for...for Terry Cavanaugh.
Yeah, Joseph Dubois.
Hi, Terry. Hi, it's Joe Dubois.
um, listen, I, uh, I wanted to get back to you on that, uh...
on that, uh, the Richter-Mullis stock buy.
Yeah, well, you could have knocked me down with a feather, but my wife actually went ahead and she had a dream about it.
she said to go ahead and buy it.
but to be sure and do it today.
Hey, Lee, this is like the millionth message.
I'm sorry to keep bugging you but I was wondering what was happening with our dentist, Jeremy Crane?
uh, was he at home?
did you guys pick him up? Are you at the park?
uh...can you just give me a call, please?
all right, don't worry about it. I'll call you as soon as I can.
Hey, what are you doing?
returning your call. In person.
but this...This looks like a picture of the woman that I dreamt about.
but she looks dead.
that's 'cause she is dead.
but how can she be dead? I-It's barely sundown.
you've been staking out the park all day.
well, that explains it then.
this girl was found by a security guard dumped behind a restroom at a truck stop yesterday.
and did I mention this truck stop's 20 miles away from Benedict Park?
but I'm confused. What about Jeremy Crane? Did you find him? Did you arrest him?
well, I spent the whole day looking for him.
finally tracked him down about an hour ago but, uh, I won't be arresting him.
why not?
cause he's in the intensive care unit at Casa Valley Hospital.
has been for the past four months.
that's not possible. I saw it.
I saw him in the park killing this girl tonight.
you saw wrong.
Jeremy Crane had a stroke four months ago.
the guy hasn't taken a breath without the aid of a machine ever since.
he didn't kill this woman. He didn't kill any of them.
no. - Yes.
you made a mistake. Like I did yesterday.
letting that guy into your home.
but, uh, it's okay, no one got hurt.
we live to fight another day.
are we talking about yesterday or today?
I'm talking about all of it.
I saw him.
you think you saw him.
I thought I knew who I was letting in your house.
go home.
that's what I'm going to do.
you have kids; I have a pregnant girlfriend.
I know you're sorry, you know I'm sorry. Let's leave it at that.
no, no, no, you know what? I'm not sorry.
I saw it; I saw him kill her. I know what I saw!
you're really not going to use our bathroom?
well, not yet. Not for a while. I'm just gonna go in the girls' bedroom.
I'll be quiet; I'll go in their bathroom.
okay.
hang on a sec. This is gonna be for you.
Hello? - Joe?
Hi, Terry.
am I disturbing you?
no, uh, just getting ready for bed. Where are you?
somewhere in the middle of nowhere.
halfway between heaven and earth.
you all right? You been drinking?
the answer is yes and yes.
I'm all right. And I have been drinking.
did you happen to check the market when it closed this evening?
no, why?
everything all right? What did Terry say?
uh, Richter-Mullis. He was calling about Richter-Mullis.
the stocks? What about them?
I guess they were up...
a little bit before lunch.
and then they just fell off the face of the earth.
the contracts that they were gonna get they didn't get and the, uh, contracts that they already had, I guess the government isn't gonna renew them.
what does this mean?
um, I gotta start laying people off. Tomorrow.
I guess the hope is that if I can lay off enough people, get my costs down enough, maybe I'll...I'll still have a company.
maybe I'll still have a job.
Joe, honey, I'm so sorry.
I heard it in my dream as clear as a bell.
I swear.
I heard it as clear as a bell.
no. Please...
Oh, God, please...
please, you don't have to do this.
you're right, I don't.
but the thing is... I want to.
no fair.
you always get to go first.
I'm sorry, you're right.
it's your turn to land the first blow.
go ahead, Boss, she's all yours.
what the hell's going on down there?
why didn't you tell me you were having a party?
wow, I can't believe it. You were actually gonna start without me.
come on, stop your whining. You didn't actually miss anything.
so, can I start this thing?
you...you can't do this. I voted for you.
my goodness.
your own husband...
brutalizing that woman.
aren't you going to call the police?
Oh, that's right.
the police were there.
how do you know that?
how do you know what I just dreamt?
Oh, Allison, dreams don't just happen.
they have to come from somewhere.
they have to come from someone.
and for the last little while your dreams have been coming from me.
what are you saying?
the Bible is very clear.
for dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.
you put your trust in dreams.
you offer yourself as a false prophet.
so, I've been making it my business to render those dreams useless.
I'm simply doing God's work.
God's work?
why else would he have allowed me to perish?
so I could be here.
so I could do this.
so I could make you see that dentist and his license plate.
that was you?
or hear about that company that was so important to your husband.
people are going to lose their jobs.
everything my husband ever worked for.
the Lord moves in mysterious ways.
it isn't ours to question.
misery and sadness, murder, brutality, it's all part of the plan.
all essential to the balance.
and now, as long as I'm in your head, as long as I'm the sculptor of your dreams, that balance can be maintained.
those that are meant to die will.
no Allison Dubois to foretell their untimely ends and put a stop to it.
things will be as they are meant to be.
sweet dreams... bitch!
name's Autumn Colville. Mother reported her missing yesterday.
the blood. And that corpse.
what corpse?
Scanlon just called. They found the remains of Autumn Colville.
there were several more duffel bags down there.
when they opened them up, they found the butchered body parts of two more girls.
looks like we got ourselves a serial killer.
I got a call from Ashley's father today.
he's convinced that his daughter is sharing her antianxiety medication with you.
there's this girl, and she won't leave me alone and she won't let me study or concentrate...
wait a second. Hold on. What girl?
Stacey Anne-- is she dead?
we decided that if the doctor thinks that this medicine will improve the quality of your life,
I will try to get that appointment as soon as possible.
Allison Dubois? I'm Caitlyn Lynch.
I'm with the Lydecker Corporation.
you're offering me a job?
what exactly does it mean when they say "high six figures"?
means you need to call her tomorrow.
you need to find out what this is all about.
so you think I should take it?
how do you not take it?
these are employee dossiers.
I'd like you to spend some time with them.
see if there's anyone among this group that gives you pause.
well, he's really the only person who jumped out at me.
and this is the only employee that you're worried about?
he's Justin Lydecker. Mr. Lydecker's son.
your father is interested in my impressions of things, people, which is why I think he wanted me to sit down with you.
Yeah. That's what I figured.
he wants you to tell him if his only son is permanently screwed up or if I can be...
salvaged.
Lee, it's me. I just had another dream.
I think it happened again, another murder.
the dreams you've been having about the murders, did you mention your dreams to your colleague?
dreams that we're talking about have nothing to do with Lydecker.
your dreams, your impressions, they belong to Lydecker now.
they are actually the intellectual property of our company.
if you ever breach your contract again,
I will litigate you with a vigor unlike anything you have ever experienced in your life.
he knows.
hold on a second, wait. I'm not following. Who-who is this "he"?
what is it you're saying that he knows?
and while we're at it, where are you going?
I think I need to get dressed. I need to go tell somebody.
but, Allison...
it's not even 6: 00 in the morning. Tell me.
that maniac who's killing all those women, gouging their eyes out, it's Justin Lydecker.
Douglas Lydecker's son, my boss's son, his only son, his only child.
and I think he knew, or at least he suspected.
I think that's why he hired me.
to do what? To get confirmation?
that, and the special added bonus that if I ever dreamt the awful truth,
I couldn't do anything with those dreams because...
he owns them. Your dreams are his. That's-that's very smart.
guess that's how you get to be Douglas Lydecker.
so what are you gonna do?
I have to tell the district attorney.
maybe if I hurry up, I can get there before Devalos arrives.
nobody will see me. No one will ever know.
I had a very interesting dream about you last night.
you were having a conversation with your husband about things you saw in your sleep.
and then you made a decision toDI cUMome here and share what you saw with your old boss.
well, then you know everything there is to know.
why don't you come in with me, and we can talk to the district attorney together.
Allison, I'm not going in there.
and you're not going in there. It's simply not going to happen.
I beg to differ.
Allison, if you go in that building and have the conversation you intend to, you'll be forcing Mr. Lydecker to take legal action.
I'm trying to help you.
this is difficult for me, too.
well, let me make it easier. Here, I quit.
it doesn't work that way.
go back and read your contract.
quitting doesn't release you from the terms of our agreement. Far from it.
if you breach your contract in any way at any time, Lydecker can and will sue you.
they will go after all of your assets.
and when those are depleted, they'll go after any collective assets you may have with your husband.
I'm talking about your home, Allison.
I'm talking about your husband's stake in his venture with Cavanaugh Industries.
I'm talking about any college fund you may have started for your girls.
Allison, Lydecker has an army of lawyers.
and I promise you, there is nothing you own that they won't find and take away.
women are dying horrible deaths.
I'm aware of that.
Mr. Lydecker is aware of that.
we all want it to stop. It's just, it cannot stop this way.
Allison, before you play fast and loose with your family's future, please, Mr. Lydecker wants to see you.
he wants to discuss this with you.
there's nothing to discuss.
just hear him out.
Douglas is devastated about this.
I promise you, he is not an evil man.
and he has a plan on how to handle this.
are you trying to tell me something?
the thing is, if it's something important, I want to hear you.
I want to help. But if it isn't...
I'm going to the doctor's tomorrow, and I'm gonna try and get him to give me pills.
and then I won't be able to hear you. It will be too late. So...
if you have something to tell me...
Ariel, wake up. Young lady, wake up.
that's better. We don't show these videos for you to sleep through.
that girl, Karina Tyler, the first victim, she worked here, you know.
a summer intern. Justin...
Oh, he couldn't stop looking at her.
and when she came to talk to me about his...
disturbing behavior...
I did what I'd always done. I - I paid her to go away, quickly, quietly.
it worked with the girls he frightened in high school, the girls he...
forced himself on in college. It seemed to work with her.
but then... months later...
when I read that she had gone missing, I couldn't...
I couldn't help but wonder.
but we weren't sure.
that's when I told Mr. Lydecker about you.
I'd been reading about you, hearing about you.
I told Mr. Lydecker that if Karina wasn't just missing, if she were dead, that she might try to reach out through you.
well, you're right.
there's something terribly wrong with your son.
and it's up to us to stop him.
we have to go to the district attorney, - tell him what we know. - No, no. No.
it's been handled. It's being handled.
no, I'm sorry, Mr. Lydecker, it's not being handled.
it can't be handled.
your son lives to kill, and he will kill again.
and now that there's no Detective AuerbacMEhDI cleaning up after him, he will be caught.
you're aware of that, right?
he was paying a detective to cover his tracks.
detective Auerbach...
used to work for me.
he provided security for company parties, for events.
and after Justin started getting into scuffles in nightclubs,
I asked him to moonlight as Justin's bodyguard, keep him out of trouble.
are you a fan of irony, Mrs. Dubois?
Mr. Lydecker, I appreciate your pain.
but there's really only one thing to do.
Justin has to surrender to the district attorney.
I know the district attorney.
I will go down there with your son.
I will make sure that he is treated fairly.
well, that is a very generous offer.
and it's one that I would give serious consideration to if my son were still in this country.
what are you talking about?
Justin is in a safe place.
he's in the care of a physician that I trust.
he's begun a course of therapy to treat Justin's condition.
therapy? There is no therapy.
are you aware of chemical castration?
it's proven very effective in the treatment of child molesters, serial rapists.
his doctor is highly optimistic.
what about his victims?
there are four dead women he has to account for.
the families of those women deserve justice.
Yes. And they'll get it.
a kind of justice, anyway.
I've begun making anonymous donations to their families, and they'll be extremely well compensated.
Mrs. Dubois, believe me when I tell you this.
the souls of these women will always weigh heavily on me.
please don't do anything foolish.
like your dreams, keep this conversation to yourself.
just don't give me a reason to behave in ways that will make both of us very unhappy.
well?
I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.
but this contract looks pretty ironclad to me.
I think that the only thing to do is to hire an attorney.
even then I'm not holding out a lot of hope.
I don't understand. How can they control who I talk to?
I mean, as long as it's not a competitor...
no, Allison...
well, the way that I read that thing, I'm not even supposed to be having this conversation with you.
okay, be that as it may, if Junior really is under a doctor's care in some foreign country, then the immediate danger is gone.
there's really not all that much to talk to Devalos about.
and as for getting you out of there, getting you out of your contract,
I mean, I think that the only thing to do is to start looking for an attorney in the morning.
I'm psychic.
why didn't I see this coming?
how could I have been so stupid? - Don't do that.
you took the job for all the right reasons.
and don't forget, you had a lot of help. I encouraged you.
I pushed you to take it.
come on. Let's just get some rest.
for one thing, we got Ariel's doctors appointment in the morning.
for another, maybe it will give us some clarity.
maybe things will look a lot better in the morning.
I'm not nearly as convinced of that as you are.
how you feeling?
like somebody drugged me and flew me to a foreign country and locked me in my room without TV.
well, I am trying to save your life.
you're trying to save your business.
daddy, you're trying to save your reputation.
it's not good for the stock prices if people read that the CEO's son likes to julienne pretty young girls and take their eyes as souvenirs.
probably would have made for a contentious stockholders' meeting as well.
Justin, do you not understand?
they are hours away from arresting you.
you have any idea what prison would be like for someone like you?
okay. All right. You just...
you just keep clinging to your pose and I'll keep willing you into accepting the second chance that I am giving you, whether you want it or not.
you pathetic slug. - You're such an ass.
please. Please. I can't breathe. I can't...
what? He wants to live?
how human of him.
you understand about these treatments?
now. In front of me.
the nurse says we're next.
do you hear me? - What?
we're next.
you all right? - Yeah. I'm fine.
just something with my new job.
something I have to tell my-my boss.
or my boss's boss.
I tried to call, but couldn't get a hold of anyone this morning.
I'm okay here if you want to step outside and use your cell.
no. No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
you want to just go?
what do you mean? Leave?
honey, what are you talking about?
you waited a long time for this appointment.
what about your test and your studying?
Ariel, it's going to be all right.
this doctor knows me.
I think he's going to understand.
Diane? Are you out there?
why is someone knocking on my door?
whoever you are, go away.
this is my serenity time.
I've been trying to get to you all day.
sorry. I've been in meetings. On conference calls.
Mr. Lydecker's out of the country, so...
Justin isn't taking his medication.
and you know this because...
because I dreamt it last night.
he's pretending. He really doesn't want to get better.
that's not possible. His father is with him.
he's supervising the treatment himself.
he's putting on an act.
as soon as Mr. Lydecker leaves the room, Justin throws his medication in the toilet.
can you get me Mr. Lydecker, please?
you know where he is, right?
tell him it's urgent.
Allison? - Yeah, I'm afraid so.
how do you do that?
how do you know the exact moment when everything from spaghetti night is all cleaned up and it's safe to come home, huh?
very not funny. Bridgette and Marie asleep?
Yes. Just barely. You ever get to Lydecker?
no. We just kept calling and calling.
finally, Caitlyn told me just to come home.
that she'd keep trying till she got him.
I just wish I knew where they were stashing Justin.
I swear to God, I would pick up the phone and tell Devalos everything I know.
see if maybe he could make some kind of arrangement with the authorities and bring him back here.
Hey, did you happen to pick up that medication for Ariel?
Yes, indeed. All $97 worth of it.
now the challenge is going to be getting her to take it.
what are you talking about?
so, what's changed?
a week ago, all you could think about was getting those pills.
I know.
you and Dad must think I'm crazy.
there's this substitute teacher at my school, Miss Snowden.
and when I see her sometimes, it's like someone's hurt her.
she's all bloody and cut up and...
she's not really.
not yet, but it's like she's going to be.
so, is there's something we should do? Someone I should talk to?
I'm afraid that if I take these pills,
Stacey Anne won't be able to show me what I need to know.
you know that the PSATs are the day after tomorrow?
I know.
and I know that these pills will make everything I'm seeing go away.
and I'll be able to concentrate.
but if something happens to Miss Snowden...
something that I could have prevented...
so, you think you could hang onto these for a while for me?
sure, honey.
what kind of a fool do you take me for?
it's time you take your medicine.
all right, that's right, that's all right.
you just go ahead, you scream all you want!
you just scream all you want. I sent the guards away.
it's just you and me.
I'm going nowhere until these pills are in your gullet!
okay, come on.
open up! Swallow! Swallow, swallow, here we go.
open up, open, open.
swallow! Swallow. Swallow. Swallow, swallow!
isn't this fantastic?
go ahead. Pick an artery, Pop.
which one you want me to start with?
how about the carotid?
that's always a winner for me.
Hello? - Allison? It's Caitlyn.
Caitlyn, I've been trying to reach you all night.
I know. I've been on a plane. I just landed. I got your messages.
Allison, do you have a passport?
what? Yeah. W - Wait a second.
there's something I need to tell you.
I had another dream about Justin and his father.
please, Allison. I think I already know. I just...
I'm sending a car to your house.
it'll bring you to the Phoenix airport.
the Lydecker hangar. There will be a plane waiting.
it'll bring you here to me.
so we can talk.
W - Where am I going?
I'd really rather not say.
wait, Caitlyn, no. I - I'm a mother.
I - I have three children, a husband.
I'm not getting on a plane without them all knowing where I'm going.
mexico City.
the plane will land in Mexico City.
a car will be waiting to bring you to me.
what's happened here is horrible.
I really need you.
Allison, thank you for coming.
I wanted to fill you in on what's happened here.
but I already know what happened here.
no, I don't think that you do.
apparently, a radical terrorist faction, was able to infiltrate Mr. Lydecker's security force here at his vacation compound.
they slaughtered him, Allison.
Douglas Lydecker was butchered by zealous anti-capitalists determined to create chaos in the Western World and its financial markets.
Really? And did they carve his eyes out?
why are you protecting him? Why are you protecting this monster?
it's not about him.
it's about Lydecker Industries and the tens of thousands of people who work there and the hundreds of thousands of people who own stock.
Allison, public appetites, public perceptions-- those are the things that I know a lot about.
you tell the world that the son killed the father and you've sullied the Lydecker name forever.
that is the kind of scanda l that will destroy the company.
kill sales, crater the stock price.
but you tell the world that this was the work of terrorists?
well, you can't buy the public sympathy and goodwill that will engender.
people will rally around the company.
they'll feel that it's their duty to do so.
and what about Justin? He's still out there. What's to say he won't kill again?
I am taking care of it.
I'm going to find Justin and I will deal with him in a way that doesn't hurt the company or either of us.
us? What do you mean, us?
us. You and me.
all of our fates are tied to Justin at this point.
we have all helped to cover his crimes.
if Justin is ever implicated in this murder,
I have no doubt that he will happily detail everything we've done to help him elude the authorities.
so, I suggest you wipe that disapproving look off your face and get on board.
we're in this together, Allison.
and the sooner you realize that, the better.
I love you.
young lady. First row? Eyes front.
I think that you really need to go now, Garrett.
no.
please.
I love you.
I don't understand.
doesn't that mean anything to you?
Garrett, don't do this.
I am as low as I can possibly be.
not that it matters to you but this...
this girl that I was tutoring privately for the PSATs, she died in a car accident a couple weeks ago.
drowned.
today was the memorial and...
no, I just... I need to be by myself.
I need to not be worrying about you.
I need you to go.
please don't make me call somebody.
I'm sorry about the girl.
but I'm staying here. I'm sleeping here.
put it down.
put it down. - Go.
don't forget to get a good night's sleep, folks.
tomorrow's the big day.
miss Snowden? - Yes?
do you know somebody named Garrett?
I- I'm sorry. Wh-What is your name?
young lady, I'm talking to you.
you seem to know some things about me and I'd like to know how and I'd like to know your name.
sir?
Allison. What are you doing here?
Douglas Lydecker's son?
I know I should've told you sooner.
I debated with myself all the way home on the plane and then I landed,
I called Joe, he told me to drive right over here from the airport.
I'm so sorry.
you did what you had to do to protect your family.
I understand that.
you were being threatened by Douglas Lydecker. That's a formidable threat.
he might still be alive today if I just ignored him and came right to you.
so, what happens now?
I really don't know.
if the Lydecker boy is truly at large in a foreign country, the first step would be to try to extradite him.
and that's almost impossible to do without concrete physical evidence.
you can't do anything?
not at the moment.
I may talk to Justice, ask some friends of mine there to take a second and third look at this terrorist thing with an especially jaundiced eye, but...
what?
I've been quaking in anticipation of this conversation.
Douglas Lydecker convinced me that the second that
I even uttered his son's name to you, the earth was just gonna open up and swallow me and my family whole.
but...
nothing is different now that we had this conversation. Nothing.
nothing's gonna happen.
except I know that Justin Lydecker is gonna kill again.
all of us here at the Lydecker Corporation are obviously still reeling with the news of the death of our founder and CEO, Douglas Lydecker.
but I want to reassure all of our investors, our customers and our employees around the globe that our business operations will continue without interruption.
I believe to do anything less would be to suggest that the savagery that ended this great industrial titan's life was somehow effective and that our founder's belief in the power of ideas to create worthwhile products and meaningful employment was somehow misplaced.
of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Thank you.
and that was the scene at a hastily called press conference in Mexico today where Caitlyn...
well, I'm glad somebody's happy about all this.
Devalos actually said there was nothing he could do?
well, he needs evidence. He needs Justin to come back to America.
the first he doesn't have and the second...
is never gonna happen.
so, he's right, there's nothing to do.
except of course, for me to find a lawyer to get me out of this Lydecker contract.
but, hey...
that's why God invented tomorrow.
can I talk to you for a second?
I didn't know what to do.
but I just didn't believe that he would hurt her.
not kill her, anyways.
and I just... I left.
I ran away.
I mean, she doesn't know my name or anything and she's just a substitute, but I feel like an idiot.
I don't know how I'm gonna go in that classroom tomorrow and take that test with her standing there.
you think maybe that was the point?
you think maybe Stacey Anne just wanted to play a big joke on me?
try and get me to embarrass myself with the teacher who was gonna proctor the test?
I have no idea, honey, but you are gonna walk in that classroom.
you are gonna take that test.
obviously, I'll just be mortified.
I'll just slink in with my head down and sit in the back and hope that somehow she doesn't notice me, doesn't say anything.
what are you saying? That you might want to take one of those pills?
no, I don't think so.
I think the worst is over. I think Stacey Anne is done with me.
I think that the hardest part's gonna be walking through the door.
go ahead. Pick an artery, Pop.
which one do you want me to start with?
how about the carotid, huh? That's always a winner for me.
Diane, are you out there?
why is someone knocking on my door?
she knew. - What?
Caitlyn knew Justin was gonna kill his father.
she knew it before I did, but she didn't do anything to stop it.
you knew.
what?
No,"It's good to have you back"?
No,"How was your flight?" Just,"You knew.
so, what did I know, Allison?
what is it that you think that I knew?
that Justin was gonna kill his father.
when I came here that day to tell you he wasn't taking his medication, you already knew.
you had dreamt it. You-you... you just let it happen.
that is quite an accusation.
so what? Now-now you're just running the place?
well, temporarily.
ultimately, that will be up to the board.
but presuming I do a good job...
Allison, this will be good for you, too.
I understand better than most what a valuable asset you can be.
I understand what a real value you are to a company like ours.
you let Mr. Lydecker die.
I saw it, Caitlyn. I am onto you, and I'm not gonna let you get away with it.
get away with what exactly?
I mean, even if you were accurate about any of this, you still haven't suggested that I actually did anything, have you?
I mean, all that might have happened was maybe I had a dream and didn't tell anyone.
that's what you're saying, right?
that's not a crime.
now I need to freshen up.
have a little contemplation time.
Oh, I was thinking in maybe about an hour, we'll have a little meeting, you, me, some of the division leaders.
I have some big plans I'm gonna lay out.
do you even know where he is? Justin?
he is dangerous!
you told me you were gonna do something about him.
no. Actually, I have no idea.
that's part of what I was counting on you for.
Allison, you seem to have a special dream connection with him.
Caitlyn, you're 11: 00 is here.
Allison, I need you to go. I need to get on with my day.
Oh, Allison, remember, you're still under contract here.
and I expect you to honor the same level of confidentiality that existed before Mr. Lydecker passed on...
or face the same consequences.
please take a moment to complete the personal information in section A.
take one test booklet and pass the rest to the person behind you.
and your 25 minutes begins now.
eyes front, no talking.
Julie, come on! Open the door!
I know you're in there.
it's Wednesday, 10: 30. It's a school night.
don't pretend you can't hear me.
I still got my key. I'm coming in, okay?
it's Garrett.
I'm coming in, okay?
Hey, you okay?
it's okay, honey. Look...
they said that you could take that test again in a couple months.
look, I know you're disappointed.
I know you put a lot of pressure on yourself.
and maybe next time we should rethink this pill thing.
I mean, if...
if that's what makes it easier for you to deal with these situations...
someone's gonna take her eyes.
what?
miss Snowden...on a Wednesday, around 10: 30, someone's gonna come into her house and cut her up and take her eyes.
Diane, can you make my 11: 00 a lunch meeting?
I want to go down to R&D in the morning.
Yes, of course. - Thank you.
Justin Lydecker, son of recently deceased billionaire Douglas Lydecker, was arrested earlier this evening in connection with a grisly string of murders in the Phoenix area.
we're told the case broke when Justin Lydecker was caught breaking into and entering an apartment of a local teacher.
the authorities have confirmed that Lydecker had numerous surgical knives in his possession at the time of the arrest.
the police are also said to be investigating a theory that the young man may actually have been responsible for his father's death - in Mexico City earlier this week, - Oh, my God.
a murder that was initially... - Ms. Lynch?
not now.
I'm sorry, but Allison Dubois is here.
she has the district attorney with her.
come in. Have a seat.
thank you, but that's okay. We won't be staying that long.
I see that you already know about the arrest of Justin Lydecker.
Yes, I'm-I'm shocked.
I knew he was troubled, but I had no idea...
stop, Caitlyn. Just stop. He knows everything.
Justin-- at the request of his counsel
became quite talkative when I took the death penalty off the table.
he shared some very interesting information about you.
apparently, you knew all about his intentions towards his father.
said he discussed it with you at length.
that you had tipped him off in advance that his father planned to transport him to Mexico and that you even suggested that that might be the perfect place for him to kill his father.
that you knew you could pay off the right officials to make it look like an act of terror.
let me make sure I understand.
you're accusing me of some sort of crime based on the word of an admitted serial killer?
well, if that's all you have, I'm quite confident that my attorney's will make short work of these accusations.
actually, our case doesn't hinge on Justin's word as much as on the combined contents of his voice mail inbox here at Lydecker, his personal cell phone text-message records and the testimony of some of the officials that you paid off in Mexico.
so do you want to take a moment to make that phone call to your attorneys now or would you prefer to wait till we get downtown?
I'd prefer to make that call now, if you don't mind.
not a problem. Mrs. Dubois and I will wait outside.
I'm sure you'll understand that after I get off the phone with my attorneys,
I'll be calling Human Resources and instructing them to terminate your contract, retrieve you car, collect any keys, computer data, documents, any items of clothing that might have been purchased with corporate funds.
I'll also be sending someone to your house to retrieve any property that might have been purchased with corporate dollars.
and I'm grateful.
I don't know how to do it.
I don't know how to fire these people.
I want to buy back my company and my idea from you.
the business is not for sale.
your idea is not for sale.
you are not for sale.
if you're still interested...
I'll sell you back your company.
if you can get together a couple of million dollars, we can figure o how you can pay me the balance over time.
I'm Cynthia Keener.
I'm an investigator with Ameritips.
I guess she's hoping I'll be able to help her with some of her cases.
according to this, Cynthia Keener had a daughter named Suzie who went missing in 1998.
I had nothing to do with her death.
if you think this is over, you're wrong.
Suzie... it was my job to stand up for her.
and now I finally have.
it's all right, Allison.
I've called the authorities.
they'll be here in a moment.
you should have that looked at.
could leave a nasty scar.
you're late. I was about to leave.
Oh, I'm not sure I believe that.
I think you'd have waited as long as you had to.
it's all there. Unmarked bills, just like you asked.
no tricks. No transmitters.
Where's Bethany?
down there.
Oh, my God. What have you done?
I buried her down there an hour ago.
figure she has maybe five or six minutes of air left.
Bethany! Can you hear me?
Bethany! Bethany, I'm coming!
Bethany! Can you hear me?!
can you hear me? I'm coming!
Bethany! Can you hear me?
what do you think?
professional or funereal?
definitely professional.
professional undertaker, maybe.
you know what? You look like the kind of guy I would sell a company to.
Really? Well, that and two million dollars will get me a company.
come on, you just need more time to get the money.
Terry will understand that.
today's the deadline.
I mean, it's not like I have some of the money. I don't have any of the money.
and the truth is, even if I do get an extension
I don't know where I'm going to get this money from.
which tie?
earth to Allison.
no. N-No tie. Neither one. Too much.
that's why I married you.
what are so taken with on my computer there?
I had a dream last night about Cynthia Keener.
a "woman in prison" kind of dream?
no.
no, it was something that took place a while ago, and I just found this old newspaper article that makes it look like it actually happened.
do you want to share?
do you really care?
no.
fine, then ignore me.
Hi. My name's Allison Dubois.
this is actually the third time that I've called.
I'm trying to arrange a... a visit with a prisoner that you have there.
her name's Cynthia Keener.
Yeah, I am calling from a city phone, but this is not official business.
you don't understand my wife!
she checks in with me three times a day;
I haven't heard from her!
I'm a taxpayer! - I see...
this is a crime!
look, all I know is, my wife has been missing for 12 hours, and nobody is doing a damn thing.
Mr. Sipes? - Mr. Sipes, what?
it's standard police procedure to wait 36 hours before filing a missing...
don't talk to me about 36 hours!
if I'd have backed you in the election,
I am sure that the National Guard would be out there right now looking for Amy.
I understand. So, I'll just...
I'll just wait for your call.
let me give you my cell number.
Yeah, come in.
you okay?
Oh... you mean that little scene just now?
I've been through worse. Just not lately.
who was that man?
I thought you knew. That was Christopher Sipes.
why do I know that name?
he's become a pretty big player in downtown Phoenix real estate the last few years.
has his name on a lot of buildings, or on the signs in front of buildings.
a real rags to riches story.
although making a lot of money hasn't made him any nicer.
Oh, and here's a shock.
his wife disappeared, or so he says.
you think otherwise?
you're right.
why would anyone leave the charming Mr. Sipes and not tell him where they're going?
nonetheless, I'm going to ask Detective Scanlon to run her license plates, and check her credit cards, do whatever we can until the police can launch an official search.
is there anything I can do?
you have a collect call from an inmate at the Arizona State Women's Correctional Facility.
to accept the call, please press "one.
you don't want to see me.
it's not like I have a lot of great stories to tell.
sun comes up. Sun goes down.
I know because I watch the shadows travel across my cell wall all day.
now you know everything.
why don't you save yourself the trip?
I had a dream about you last night.
was it good? Do I get out of here?
lie. Give me hope.
I'm not going to tell you.
not unless you let me come and see you.
sorry I'm late. - It's fine.
actually, I'm not going to be able to eat.
I only have a few minutes.
you look anxious.
no, no...
well, maybe a little.
it's gone, Joe.
I sold it.
that deadline wasn't one I picked arbitrarily.
I needed to get your venture off my books.
I explained that to you.
I felt I owed you the opportunity to buy the company, and had you been able to come up with the money,
I'd have happily sold it to you, but...
here we are.
I didn't have much trouble finding a buyer.
you should be proud, Joe.
you've built an attractive little start-up.
who's the buyer?
it's an outfit called Tesseract Industrial.
out of San Diego.
coming on like gangbusters.
it's run by a fellow named Simon Burwell who's been on a bit of a buying spree.
what happens to me, Terry?
well, your contract is part of the sale, so it'll be up to Tesseract to either keep you on board or pay you off.
well, that's between you and them.
look... I know how much this project meant to you, and I know how painful it must be to realize you're probably not going to be able to see it through to the end.
my advice to you?
get a good lawyer and make them pay through the nose when they try to settle with you.
money won't get rid of all the pain, but it'll help.
waiter?
anything he wants.
thank you.
it's wonderful to see you, too.
I wasn't sure what you wanted, what you needed.
you're going to make me the most popular girl on Block C.
I've been dreaming about this, and I don't know why.
first time I met Bethany was when I pulled her out of that grave.
I saw it.
the man in the mask. The bite mark on his hand.
the bite marks were courtesy of Bethany.
the night he buried her, she fought back.
she sunk her teeth in real deep.
she wanted to hurt him, mark him permanently.
the way he did to her.
they never caught him, did they?
what about the girl?
did you keep in touch?
I heard some things. Nothing good.
the parents were quite well off, before the kidnapping.
the two million ransom ruined them.
the father committed suicide.
the mother started drinking very heavily, started taking drugs.
she fell asleep one night behind the wheel.
drove off a bridge.
I want to say Bethany was... 15.
and after that?
after that, there were more stories
foster homes, drugs...
maybe prostitution.
listen, Allison.
I don't know why you're asking me all these questions.
I don't know why this girl is in your dreams.
and I don't know, for that matter, why I'm in your dreams, but I want to make one thing clear:
I hate it here.
I hate my life.
I pray every night that it'll end.
I don't want visitors.
I don't want friends.
so, if you call me, I won't answer the phone.
and I won't see you.
it's my husband.
must be nice.
Bye, Allison.
thanks for the things.
it's open.
the concierge said you were looking for someone to show you around Phoenix.
he thought I might know all the places you were interested in seeing.
you in the shower?
need any help?
Nah. I'm okay.
the donation for charity is on the nightstand.
can I get you a drink?
don't worry about me.
just make yourself comfortable.
so, uh... you're my guide?
anywhere you want to go, I'm sure I can get you there.
you won't be needing this.
I thought I told you.
I had another dream. - I don't care.
for God sakes! The only freedom I have in here is the freedom to decide whether I want to see other human beings or not.
and you've figured out a way to take that away from me!
who do you think you're kidding, telling them this is police business?
this isn't police business.
no one's died, nothing's been stolen.
Bethany has crossed paths with her kidnapper.
Bethany recognized the bite mark on his hand.
Cynthia, I think this is why...
this is why I've been dreaming about her.
I mean, she recognized him.
who's to say he didn't recognize her?
and if so, he couldn't just let her walk out of the room.
I have been making calls all morning.
she hasn't used her credit card, her cell phone.
she hasn't pickeup her mail in a week.
you know, Allison...
after you left the last time,
I used up all my phone privileges to try and get in touch with Bethany.
when that didn't work,
I swapped all the stuff that you brought and bought myself some more.
I called every old number I had for Bethany.
left messages.
I called every cop, ery parole officer, every youth counselor.
and, you know...
...for those 40 minutes, it was like...
I wasn't in here at all.
did anything come of it?
did you make any connections?
no.
there's nothing left. It's all gone, man. You guys are done!
it's all gone.
just have the office furniture guy give me a call when you get to the warehouse with a figure, all right?
this mine or this yours?
well, that depends. Who are you?
my name is Simon Burwell. I own Tesseract Industrial.
you are?
my name's Joe Dubois. That's yours.
just make sure you turn off all the lights when you're done.
where are you going?
Oh, I've been told I have to hire a really good lawyer so I can make you pay through the nose when you try to settle with me.
what if I don't want to settle with you?
what if I want to honor your contract, have you work for me?
my wife put you up to this?
I mean, frankly,
I could hire a mediocre engineer at half what you're going to cost me to see this project through to market, but
I'd rather have a great engineer.
you know, I'd rather have the guy who cooked the whole thing up.
I hear a "but" in there. Where's the "but"?
no, no. No "buts.
none of consequence, anyways.
how do you feel about the ocean?
you're going to drown me if I don't come work for you?
we're in San Diego, Joe. We're all in San Diego.
it's beautiful.
you know, it's whe we started, and it's, uh, it's where we're staying, and it's where you gotta be if you want to stay with your baby.
I've got a daughter who's halfway through high school.
my wife works for the local DA.
we have great schools.
I don't know what kind of work your wife does, but if she's good, we could throw our weight around, we could make some calls.
we're a big presence in San Diego.
it's not that simple.
it is.
we'll buy your house here.
we'll help you find a house there.
you know, we do this all the time.
did I mention the ocean?
special delivery for Mrs. Dubois.
what's this?
it's all the files on the Bethany Simmons' kidnap from 11 years ago;
I thought maybe you'd want to look through those.
Thanks.
I appreciate this.
I appreciate all of this, especially knowing how busy you are running around looking for that hothead,
christopher Sipes' wife.
Manny didn't tell you?
all that went away.
ol' hothead phoned this morning.
turns out the wife's okay.
she called him last night from a resort in Ixtapa, Mexico.
just felt the two of them needed a little break.
are you saying that this woman left the country without telling her husband?
that so hard to believe? You met the guy.
frankly, I think she showed remarkable restraint by staying in the same hemisphere.
Hello?
I'm home.
it's about time.
your dinner's in the fridge.
Where've you been? I was about to send ou the Phoenix Mounties.
mm, bookstore.
who went to the Grand Canyon?
nobody we know.
I have your daughter.
I will return her in exchange for $2 million.
contact the police and she will die.
Yeah, ransom note. Pretty cute, huh?
11 years ago, Bethany Simmons' kidnapper sent this note to her parents.
the police recovered a partial fingerprint, but they could never figure out who it belonged to.
so he just got away with $2 million?
Yup.
what did you get, a set of encyclopedias?
what's with all these books on San Diego?
I met my new boss today.
what do you want me to say?
well, I don't know, Allison.
what do you want me to say?
a guy offers me a job doing something that I desperately want to do at a time in history when no one, no one is getting offered any kind of a job.
and, yeah, holy crap, there's a little, you know, there's some inconvenience and there's, you know, some sacrifice involved.
no, you're right, you're right. All right, you know, I'm sorry I brought it up.
come on, that's not fair.
I mean, Ariel's going to be a junior next year.
she's going to be... she's going to be applying for college in two years.
okay, you're not saying anything that I didn't say.
and, you know, I have a job, too.
do you think I forgot?
he said he'd help with that.
that's what I did.
I just... I don't think that we can just say "no.
I mean, it might be a beautiful, grand, wonderful adventure.
new house.
new climate. New friends.
there are worse things.
no. I hear that.
I just... I want you to sleep on it.
I mean, I want to sleep on it.
that's right, Mr. Devalos, I, uh, I just got off the phone with her.
Mexico. Ixtapa.
what did she say? Um...
she said that she needed a little bit of time to think about us, think about our marriage.
I don't know. My head is spinning. I'm upset.
I'm embarrassed.
I know, I made an ass of myself in your office.
no, no.
you have nothing to be sorry for.
I... apologize.
I HAVE YOUR WIFE. I WILL RETURN HER IN EXCHANGE FOR $10 MILLION. CONTACT THE POLICE AND SHE DIES.
I guess the important thing is, um...
my wife's just fine.
wait a second. Now you're telling me that Christopher Sipes' wife, Amy, has been kidnapped?
Yes, sir. And I'm almost certain that she was taken by the same man who abducted Bethany Simmons 11 years ago.
the ransom note is almost identical to this one.
