caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased them both.
what?
about four years ago...
...I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.
I stole a car.
it was a dumb-fuck thing to do.
about six months left to go...
...I get a new cellmate in.
Elmo Blatch.
big, twitchy fucker.
a Kind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.
said he pulled hundreds of jobs.
hard to believe, high-strung as he was. You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.
talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.
places he'd been in...
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.
even people he killed.
people who "gave him shit."
that's how he put it.
so one night, like a joke...
...I say to him, "Elmo, who did you kill?
so he says:
I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club...
...so I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.
so I pick out this guy...
...go in one night...
...and do his place.
he wakes up...
...and gives me shit.
so I killed him.
him and this tasty bitch he was with.
and that's the best part.
she's fucking this prick, see this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.
some hotshot banker.
and he's the one they pinned it on.
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.
what amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.
sir?
it's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.
he hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.
he's young, not terribly bright.
it's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.
sir, he's telling the truth.
let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.
you think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.
by the way, add a life term to my sentence.
with Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.
that's assuming Blatch is still there.
chances are, he'd be released by now.
they'd have his last known address. It's a chance, isn't it?
how can you be so obtuse?
what?
what did you call me?
obtuse. Is it deliberate?
you're forgetting yourself.
the country club will have his old timecards.
records, W-2s with his name on them.
if you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.
don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
if I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.
don't ever mention money to me, you son of a bitch!
not in this office...
...not anywhere. Get in here, now!
I just wanted to put you at ease, that's all.
solitary. A month.
what's wrong with you? Get him out of here.
this is my chance to get out! It's my life! Understand?!
get him out!
a month in the hole.
that's the longest stretch I ever heard of.
it's all my fault.
bullshit.
you didn't pull the trigger or convict him.
are you saying Andy is innocent?
I mean, for real innocent?
it looks that way.
sweet Jesus.
how long has he been here now?
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.
Williams, Thomas. - Yeah, over here.
what you got?
board of Education.
that son of a bitch mailed it.
you going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?
thumb up my butt sounds better.
Skeets, come on. Give me that, you shithead.
Floyd, come on.
red
will you throw that away, please?
well, shit.
the kid passed. C + average.
thought you'd like to know.
warden wants to talk.
out here?
that's what the man said.
warden?
Tommy
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.
I feel awkward enough as it is.
we got a situation here.
I think you can appreciate that.
Yes, sir.
I sure can.
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.
it's got me up nights. That's the truth.
the right thing to do...
...sometimes it's hard to know what that is.
do you understand?
I need your help, son.
if I'm going to move on this there can't be the least little shred of doubt.
I have to know...
...if what you told Dufresne was the truth.
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.
would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...
...with your hand on the Good Book...
...and take an oath before Almighty God himself?
just give me that chance.
that's what I thought.
I'm sure by now you've heard.
terrible thing.
a man that young...
...less than a year to go, trying to escape.
broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.
truly, it did.
we just have to put it behind us.
move on.
I'm done.
everything stops.
get someone else to run your scams.
nothing stops.
nothing.
or you will do the hardest time there is.
no more protection from the guards.
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.
you'll think you've been fucked by a train.
and the library?
gone.
sealed off, brick by brick.
we'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.
they'll see the flames for miles.
we'll dance around it like wild Injuns.
you understand me? Catching my drift?
or am I being obtuse?
give him another month to think about it.
my wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.
like a closed book.
complained about it all the time.
she was beautiful.
God, I loved her.
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.
I killed her, Red.
I didn't pull the trigger...
...but I drove her away.
that's why she died, because of me...
...the way I am.
that don't make you a murderer.
bad husband, maybe.
feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.
no, I didn't.
somebody else did.
and I wound up in here.
bad luck, I guess.
it floats around.
it's got to land on somebody.
it was my turn, that's all.
I was in the path of the tornado.
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.
think you'll ever get out of here?
me?
Yeah.
one day, when I got a long, white beard...
...and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.
I tell you where I'd go.
Zihuatanejo.
say what?
Zihuatanejo.
it's in Mexico.
a little place on the Pacific Ocean.
you know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?
they say it has no memory.
that's where I want to live the rest of my life.
a warm place with no memory.
open up a little hotel right on the beach.
buy some worthless old boat...
...and fix it up new.
take my guests out...
...charter fishing.
Zihuatanejo.
in a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.
I don't think I could make it on the outside.
I been in here most of my life.
I'm an institutional man now.
just like Brooks was.
you underestimate yourself.
I don't think so.
in here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but...
...outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.
hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.
pacific Ocean?
shit.
scare me to death, something that big.
not me.
I didn't shoot my wife, and I didn't shoot her lover.
whatever mistakes I made, I've paid for them and then some.
that hotel, that boat...
I don't think that's too much to ask.
you shouldn't be doing this to yourself.
this is just shitty pipe dreams.
mexico is way down there and you're in here...
...and that's the way it is.
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.
it's down there and I'm in here.
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.
get busy living...
...or get busy dying.
Andy
red
if you ever get out of here, do me a favor.
sure, Andy. Anything.
there's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?
a lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular.
it's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.
it's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.
it's where I asked my wife to marry me.
we went there for a picnic...
...and made love under that oak...
...and I asked and she said yes.
promise me, Red.
if you ever get out...
...find that spot.
at the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.
piece of black, volcanic glass.
something's buried under it I want you to have.
what, Andy?
what's buried under there?
you'll have to pry it up...
...to see.
no, I'm telling you. The guy is...
I'm really worried about him.
let's keep an eye on him.
that's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.
Oh, Lord.
what?
Andy come down to the loading dock today.
he asked me for a length of rope.
rope? Six feet long.
and you gave it to him.
sure. Why wouldn't I?
Jesus! Heywood. How was I supposed to know?
remember Brooks Hatlen?
Andy would never do that.
never.
I don't know.
every man has his breaking point.
Lickety-split. Want to get home.
just about finished, sir.
three deposits tonight.
get my stuff down to the laundry.
and shine my shoes.
I want them looking like mirrors. - Yes, sir.
it's good having you back.
place wasn't the same without you.
lights out!
I've had some long nights in stir.
alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts...
... time can draw out like a blade.
that was the longest night of my life.
give me a count!
tier 3 south, clear!
tier 3 north, clear!
man missing on tier 2, cell 245!
Dufresne!
come out. You're holding up the show!
don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!
damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.
you'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!
you hear me?
Oh, my Holy God.
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.
start with that friend of his. - Who?
he
open 237.
what do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.
don't tell me that again.
but sir, he wasn't.
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?
is that what you're saying?
am I blind, Haig? - No, sir!
what about you. You blind?
tell me what this is. - Last night's count.
you see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.
Dufresne.
he was in his cell at lights out.
reasonable he'd be here in the morning.
I want him found.
not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!
Yes, sir.
let's go. Move your butts.
stand.
well?
well, what?
I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.
he must have said something.
no, sir, Warden.
not a word.
Lord, it's a miracle!
man vanished like a fart in the wind.
nothing left...
...but some damn rocks on a windowsill.
and that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.
maybe she knows.
what say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?
guess not.
why should she be any different?
this is a conspiracy.
that's what this is.
one big, damn conspiracy!
and everyone's in on it!
including her!
in 1966...
... Andy Dufresne escaped...
... from Shawshank Prison.
all they found was a muddy set of prison clothes...
... a bar of soap...
... and an old rock hammer...
... damn near worn down to the nub.
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.
old Andy did it in less than 20.
Oh, Andy loved geology.
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.
an ice age here...
... million years of mountain building there.
geology is the study of pressure and time.
that's all it takes, really.
pressure...
... and time.
that and a big goddamn poster.
like I said...
... in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.
seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard...
... a handful at a time.
I guess after Tommy was killed...
... Andy decided he'd been here long enough.
Lickety-split. I want to get home.
I'm just about finished, sir.
three deposits tonight.
Andy did like he was told.
buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.
the guards simply didn't notice.
neither did I.
I mean, seriously...
... how often do you really look at a man's shoes?
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...
... of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.
or maybe I just don't want to.
five hundred yards.
that's the length of five football fields.
just shy of half a mile.
the next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret...
... a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...
... strolled into the Maine National Bank.
until that moment, he didn't exist.
except on paper. - May I help you?
he had all the proper ID...
... driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card...
and the signature was a spot-on match.
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.
thank you.
I'm sure I will.
here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?
please.
would you add this to your outgoing mail?
I'd be happy to.
good day, sir.
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.
all told, he blew town with better than $370, 000 of Warden Norton's money.
severance pay for 19 years.
good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.
if you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...
... when they took him away.
norton had no intention of going that quietly.
Samuel•Norton.
we have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
open the door.
I'm not sure which key.
make it easy on yourself, Norton!
I like to think the last thing that went through his head...
... other than that bullet...
... was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.
not long after the warden deprived us of his company...
... I got a postcard in the mail.
it was blank, but the postmark said...
... Fort Hancock, Texas.
fort Hancock...
... right on the border.
that's where Andy crossed.
when I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...
... it always makes me laugh.
Andy Dufresne...
... who crawled through a river of shit...
... and came out clean on the other side.
Andy Dufresne...
... headed for the Pacific.
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?
he says, " I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident.
those of us who knew him best talk about him often.
I swear, the stuff he pulled...
my friends could use a couple of beers.
and he got it!
sometimes it makes me sad, though Andy being gone.
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.
their feathers are just too bright.
and when they fly away...
... the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.
but still...
... the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.
I guess I just miss my friend.
please sit down.
Ellis Boyd Redding...
...your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.
you feel you've been rehabilitated?
rehabilitated?
well, now, let me see.
I don't have any idea what that means.
it means you're ready to rejoin society...
I know what you think it means, sonny.
to me it's just a made-up word.
a politician's word so that...
...young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie...
...and have a job.
what do you really want to know?
am I sorry for what I did?
well, are you?
there's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.
not because I'm in here or because you think I should.
I look back on the way I was then...
...a young...
...stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.
I want to talk to him.
I want to try and talk some sense to him.
tell him the way things are.
but I can't.
that kid's long gone...
...and this old man is all that's left.
I got to live with that.
rehabilitated?
it's just a bullshit word.
so you go on and stamp your forms, Sonny, and stop wasting my time.
because to tell you the truth...
...I don't give a shit.
here you go, Miss.
restroom break?
you don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.
yes sir
forty years I've been asking permission to piss.
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.
there's a harsh truth to face.
no way I'm going to make it on the outside.
all I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole...
... so maybe they'd send me back.
terrible thing, to live in fear.
Brooks Hatlen knew it.
knew it all too well.
all I want is to be back where things make sense.
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.
only one thing stops me.
a promise I made to Andy.
there it is.
much obliged, sir.
dear Red:
if you're reading this, you've gotten out...
... and if you've come this far, maybe you'd come a bit further.
you remember the name of the town, don't you?
Zihuatanejo.
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.
remember, Red...
... hope is a good thing...
... maybe the best of things.
and no good thing ever dies.
I will be hoping that this letter finds you...
... and finds you well.
your friend, Andy.
get busy living or get busy dying..
that's goddamn right.
for the second time in my life...
... I'm guilty of committing a crime.
parole violation.
of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.
not for an old crook like me.
fort Hancock, Texas, please.
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.
a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.
I hope I can make it across the border.
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.
I hope.
you sure it's the Russians? - 100%, sir.
submarine launched 12 to 15 megatons. They went to strike status.
the Roosevelt's splashed six incoming cruise missiles.
the Russians are moving west. Our Berlin brigade are outnumbered.
sir, we've got a launch from Alyesk, Central Russia.
what the hell is in Alyesk?
SS-18 ICBMs.
probable targets: New York, Washington, here.
how good is this ceiling? - Anything but a direct hit.
satellites confirm birds in the air, first impact estimated 25 minutes.
is that accurate? - It's accurate.
I advise we go to DEFCON-1. - Get President Zorkin on the hotline.
Zorkin is missing. We have reports of a coup in Moscow.
general Bulgakov is calling the shots now.
who the hell is Bulgakov?
the asshole who wanted to use nukes in Chechnya.
sir, DEFCON-1. We're out of time.
do it.
mr President.
it'll take a minute for the launch to process after you give the order.
before the order can be taken, an ID check must be performed.
my ID number is fifth from the top.
sir, it's your wife on 2104. - Thank you.
Yeah. - The order must be confirmed - by someone on the approved list. - Shit.
gene Revell, National Security Advisor.
is it black tie? OK. I'm on my way.
can we finish this up some other time?
no.
we've got to update these fire drills, Billy.
if the shit ever hits the fan, I'm not going underground.
it's a goddamn tomb down there.
we have to choose someone else to face off against besides the Russians.
Really? Let's see. Who else has 27, 000 nukes for us to worry about?
it's the guy with one I'm worried about.
I have to send some folks to Russia, inspect their nuclear decommissioning facility at Armazas.
Arzamas. - Yeah, whatever.
someone from your staff should go. - I'll go.
Billy, send staff. - I want to go.
OK.
don't underestimate Zorkin.
between his economy, crime, Chechnya...
his liver. - What's left of it. How is he?
he's scheduled a press conference for today, so we know he can sit up.
chechnya is part of Russia.
only criminals and their friends in the West who wish it to be separate.
mr President, if you will kindly come back...
do you guys see what I see?
his jacket? - He used to be able to button it up.
he's getting fat.
I know how he feels. Oh, wow. Look at that.
maybe it's not the same jacket.
Yeah, it has shiny sleeves. He wore it the last time he got out of the hospital.
he's off the diet. - And off the wagon. He slurred...
that must be why Cherlinski is there, to keep him off the sauce.
Where's Cherlinski?
next to... What's her name? The chick with the brown hair.
Elena Rishkov. - That is not Cherlinski.
bzz! Busted. It's Cherlinski.
you're thinking Cherpitski. It ain't him.
I know. It's Cherlinski. - No, it's not. Trust me.
he's next to Elena Rishkov. He was banging her at the Geneva summit.
Cherlinski was not at Geneva. Cherpitski was.
Cherpitski was banging Elena Rishkov?
I just said Zorkin's putting on weight.
why reduce it to sex? It's disgusting.
I agree. Write it up. If he is putting on weight, that might have health consequences, so get it in the afternoon brief.
Oh, and somebody find out who is banging Elena Rishkov. This is good.
what shall we make of Chechnya asking the West for protection?
she is like a beautiful virgin, escaping the clutches of a lecherous bear, and running to Bill Clinton to save her maidenhood.
a poet once wrote, "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.
he could have been writing of us, of Europe in the 21 st century.
over 50 years of America and Russia imposing their will on the European community,
east and West, and we're still treated like children...
but without the toys or the goodnight chocolates.
each day we lose a little bit more of our separate sovereign ability to determine our own futures and each day the world comes just a little bit closer to that terrible moment when the beating of a butterfly's wings unleashes a hurricane...
God himself cannot stop.
so what is it?
are you blind?
it's a bomb.
Where's the fuse?
it's warm.
so am I. Come on. I don't have all night.
it's a dud.
let's get it on the truck.
but how can we sell it now?
there's always someone who'll buy this crap.
I cannot stand all these questions about my health.
I am to be described as "robust" and "healthy."
is that yours or mine?
it must be yours. Mine's just for show.
it's not the hospital.
Hi. - You're still here.
well, I think to be accurate, it's actually you who's still here.
Oh, right.
not that I'm complaining.
Jack...
I know this is new and all, but...
I have something I have to say or I'm going to explode.
I don't want you to be scared.
what?
you're in love with me.
Jack, I'm a medical professional. I can read the symptoms.
you're definitely in love with me.
and that scares you?
not even a little.
but I think it scares you.
no, not even a little.
and for the record, you're the one who brought it up.
forget it.
I'm gonna get it. - No way. It'll stop.
I don't know who this is.
just go about your business. - The timing sucks.
do what you have to do. I understand.
Yes, this is Dr Muller.
Muller. You paged me.
hello.
stop! Yes, this is Jack Ryan.
Jesus.
OK. I'll be there in half an hour.
I gotta go. I have an emergency at work.
I have to go. I'm sorry.
Cathy, how about dinner tonight?
Yeah.
how about tomorrow night? - Jack, I said yes to tonight.
I know.
what kind of emergency does a historian have?
he died at 4: 20 Zulu.
8 1/2 hours later, they swore in a new president.
who is he? - Alexander Nemerov.
you're kidding. I wrote a paper about him a year ago.
I said he could be the next guy. - I know.
nobody read it. - They're reading it now.
who? - Cabot.
I've been here 14 months. He doesn't know what I look...
are you Ryan? - Yes, sir.
what is this? "The Paper Chase"?
sir, my... - Come on, we're late.
you're about to breathe air that's way over your pay grade, so listen.
you'll be asked for advice. Be sure you know what you're talking about.
don't be afraid to say you don't know.
choose your words carefully. They could become policy.
Hey, you. Give me your coat.
come on, you'll get it back.
tie.
so, intelligence committee?
I've watched these on C-SPAN. Never actually been to one.
you've never watched one of these on C-SPAN.
our most important assessment comes from a source inside the Kremlin.
in his opinion, Nemerov does not owe his ascension to the military.
everyone has opinions, Mr Cabot.
I respect that.
this morning, my wife woke up and said I was old, bald and ugly.
is that a question, Mr Chairman?
I told her appearances aren't everything.
would you agree? - I certainly would.
now, this new fellow, Nezmeroz. Is that his name?
Nemerov, sir.
despite what your source says, we hear that Nezmeroz is a hardliner.
is he a hardliner?
no.
it's too soon to make that assessment.
according to CNN, your Mr Nezmeroz is making promises to rebuild the Russian empire.
that sounds pretty rash from where I sit.
if I were sitting in Chechnya, I'd be even more worried.
sir, Nemerov only said that to get the hardliners off his back.
if we leave him alone, Russia will stabilise.
when I asked for your advice, I didn't mean that you should actually speak.
mr Cabot?
some of our assets in the Russian government who know Mr Nemerov have not had a chance to report in.
I'd like to take a couple of days and gather more information for you before characterising him, but I do maintain my opinion that appearances can be deceiving.
you're saying I'm wrong?
absolutely, Mr Chairman.
I don't think you're ugly.
I was out of line. I apologise. - Senators don't like to be surprised.
I hint at what I'm gonna tell them, then I give them a while to get used to it.
then I tell them.
I understand. - Good.
but I'm right about Nemerov.
your girlfriend like this stubborn streak in you?
what?
Cathy Muller, second year surgical resident,
Baltimore Memorial Hospital.
welcome to the CIA, sport.
your intelligence is a little flawed. I wouldn't call her my girlfriend... yet.
what exactly would you call her? - Great. Amazing.
she's just afraid to commit.
he's terrified of commitment.
a man who's afraid of commitment after three dates? Alert the media.
I know, I know. - So what does he do?
he was in the marines before he hurt his back.
now he's a historian. - Yawn.
no. He works for a think tank across the river.
double yawn.
all right, Rita. Let's see what you have to say after we meet him tonight.
He's...cute?
I have fat fingers. - Cathy! Cute scale, one to ten.
Oh, God. I don't know.
twelve.
ask them where they found this.
in the field, in the Golan.
there was a lot of fighting there in 1973. Did they witness it?
this one says he lost his son.
does he remember, was there a plane shot down?
Yes, an Israeli jet, destroyed.
this is worthless.
but tell him I will give him $400... because of his son.
thank... thank you.
thank you.
it's not the sort of thing you find lying around normally.
absolutely not. - How did you come by it?
I found her in the attic of an old mansion house in Glasgow.
your little trip to the attic has got you a piece worth now about L1, 000, even in this condition, and had she been in better condition, even more.
a jolly nice find.
in fact, what I thought I'd found was a garden ornament.
Hello, Cathy?
Hi. I'm glad you called. I'm running late. Can you come a half an hour later?
I can't make it. I'm really sorry.
it's a last-minute work thing. - What's that noise?
I'm calling from a plane.
this just came up. I tried to call you. - Where are you going?
I can't tell you that. - Jack.
you can't tell me?
Jack.
hold on. Yes, sir? - What are you doing?
I had a date tonight, so I had to cancel.
don't be stupid. Tell her where you're going. Tell her who you work for.
she'll be impressed.
OK. I work for the CIA.
the director asked me to go with him to Russia to do a nuclear arms inspection.
Hello? - That is so lame.
I swear, we get to inspect to make sure they're decommissioning their arsenal.
Hello?
Hello?
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
Zdravstvuyte, William Cabot.
president Nemerov.
pleasure, sir.
may I present Mrs Lathrop.
mr President.
general Rand. - Mr President.
dr Ryan. - Mr President.
you must be the Dr Ryan who's done such interesting research on me.
you should not be surprised. We know quite a bit.
we know how wrong your report was that I had many girlfriends in college.
I met my wife in my third year and have not looked at another woman since.
I was referring to the first two years... sir.
where you received highest honors in English.
I like you.
well, in that case, so do I.
I apologise for interjecting myself in your inspection tour, but I have a message for President Fowler.
you could just call him on the phone.
I would like him to hear it from you, his friend of many years, who received it personally from me, and saw my expression and the language of my body as I spoke it.
I understand.
chechnya is an internal affair.
what we do there should be none of your concern.
I will relay the message, but I don't think he will agree.
some people in my country will use this issue to weaken me.
some people in my country say your war in Chechnya is exactly your weakness.
chechnya is a nation of criminals.
every day brings another cowardly attack on innocent Russian citizens.
it is none of your concern.
stability is our concern.
peace in Chechnya is our concern.
and, if I may speak frankly your control over your military concerns us too.
for you to get involved here, it's... like sleeping with another man's wife.
and what you are suggesting is that afterward they can all live together under the same roof.
but what really happens is the betrayed husband buys a gun.
that went well. - Who's the guy with Nemerov?
Anatoli Grushkov. - Old KGB?
he's been around since Brezhnev. Nobody's had the guts to get rid of him.
because he knows where the bodies are buried?
he probably buried them himself.
and we were able to obtain a roster of their scientists at Arzamas.
who's who, what their expertise is.
Arzamas-16 is home to the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics and is the birthplace of our first atomic bomb.
many of our greatest scientists worked here and many still do.
since 1995, we have dismantled over 10, 000 nuclear devices.
we tried so hard to get in here over the years.
I sent three people.
they all died trying.
what does the T-shirt say?
I am a bomb technician. If you see me running... try to catch up.
OK.
sir, I'm sorry. Just one quick thing. I'm sure it's nothing.
according to this, there are 17 senior scientists on duty today.
I only count 14.
doctors Milinov, Orlov and Spassky.
they don't seem to be here.
I will make inquiries.
dr Milinov is out sick. Orlov is on vacation.
Spassky, I'm grieved to say, was killed driving his car to work just this past week.
we move on, shall we?
please.
very impressive. You almost seem to have that information memorised.
I assumed you would ask, Dr Ryan.
we touch down at Andrews at 21：30. Tell him to meet me there.
sir? Those three missing scientists.
Milinov's expertise is detonators.
Spassky's expertise is the nuclear core.
Orlov is a mathematician whose expertise is the geometry of high explosives inside a fission bomb.
the exact three men you would need if you wanted to build a bomb.
Grushkov said... - Grushkov's a liar.
Milinov is not sick. Orlov hardly ever takes a vacation and Spassky, who's supposed to have died driving a car, doesn't drive.
they have no idea where these guys are.
I'm dying to ask you how you know.
secure source inside the Kremlin.
codename Spinnaker.
he gives me stuff, I give him stuff.
we keep the back channels open in hopes of staving off disaster.
and speaking of disaster, did you call your girlfriend yet?
no. I don't know how to get out of this.
all right. Invite her to the White House correspondents dinner Sunday night.
it's the hottest ticket in town.
sounds great. How do I get in? - Trust me.
I'll see you at the car.
still loving your desk job?
Yeah, I am.
how's your Russian?
still works. Why?
three Russian nuclear scientists are missing. I need to know where they are.
I wasn't doing this any more.
I just need information this time, Johnny.
your orders are on the plane. Wheels up at 23: 30.
have a nice flight.
Sunday night, 8. 00, at the Hilton.
the tickets are in the name of John Clark.
you do have a tux? - Yeah, yes, sir.
my beautiful wife, Julie, is from New Jersey.
15 electoral votes.
and is, as you know, half-Jewish, so we'll take Florida's 25 electoral votes and divide by two.
this is a nice hotel. - Yeah. Beautiful.
my friend Rita stayed here once. She said it was... nice.
maybe after dinner we can...
we can get a room here.
I already did.
you didn't. - Yes, I did.
I did, on a handful of occasions, smoke marijuana.
california, 54 electoral votes.
at 0600 Moscow time, the Russians launched a massive artillery strike against Grozny, the capital of Chechnya.
the shells contained an experimental chemical weapon, a nerve agent.
saturation, you can see on the sat photos, took 20 minutes, after which every person inside a radius of 12 miles was rendered helpless by symptoms approximating late-stage cerebral palsy.
Oh, my God. - How many dead?
best guess, 80%.
Nemerov launched the biggest attack in the history of chemical warfare.
let's talk response. - The worst thing we can do is nothing.
if he gets away with chemical weapons, what's next? Biological, nuclear?
OK. Short of gassing the Kremlin, what's the strongest response?
we send in peacekeepers. - Chechnya's not sovereign.
they requested recognition, so we give it. Not full diplomatic, provisional.
then the Chechens request assistance and we send in peacekeepers.
how do you get them in there? - We fly them in from Turkey.
over Armenian air space?
to screw Russia? They won't complain.
let's do it. Nemerov can choke on it.
bill?
dr Ryan. - Yes, sir.
what do you think?
conventional wisdom suggests that Nemerov is playing the traditional Russian role:
be aggressive, flex your muscles, dare the world to stop you.
but Nemerov isn't conventional. - He acts like a hardliner.
with respect, I don't think he is one.
he just gassed the capital of another country. With respect, you're wrong.
so what are we wasting our time for?
what if he didn't order the attack?
what if Nemerov didn't order the attack?
what if it was a... a rogue general?
or a military unit frustrated they couldn't get the rebels out of the city?
have you reason to believe he didn't order it, or are you just floating this?
you don't know.
I don't think he did it, sir. I would bet he didn't do it.
will senior staff remain behind for a few minutes, please?
russia's newly-installed president, Alexander Nemerov, has just begun to address the state. We join him in progress.
for ten years now, we have contended...
excuse me. Could you turn that up?
toward innocent Russian citizens.
finally...
every nation has a right to defend itself.
this terrorism must end.
the bombing of Chechnya... was my decision.
nice going, ace.
who did it?
general Pildysh, General Mitkin. Unhappy old Communists.
bastards.
relieve them of command. - I will shoot them myself.
just disappear them.
their execution would tell the world I didn't have control.
these days, better to appear guilty than impotent.
how is our Russian friend affected by this?
I am not affected. I remain devoted to our little plan.
at what you're charging us, I am not surprised.
and the American? - Mr Mason is a believer.
I put a little extra in the escrow account for him.
Why? - He won't live long enough to get it.
where is the package? - It left Haifa a week ago.
I'm told these things can kill you.
but so much has changed.
perhaps the new situation suggests we consider... a different approach?
maybe try to bring Russia more into Europe, more into our way of thinking?
we have discussed that, Monsieur Monceau, and with your concurrence, rejected it.
Oh. Perhaps we were hasty.
perhaps our plan is... - Is what?
not perfectly conceived.
are you crazy? All over the world, right-wing parties, nationalist movements, Nazis, Aryan Nations, all working together for the first time.
is that not perfect?
well, I respect the will and judgment of my friends.
but in light of the week's events, I am grown uncomfortable with this plan.
so I must... beg your leave.
gentlemen.
Herr Haft will help you out.
your scarf, monsieur.
watch it with that thing. You're gonna kill somebody.
yo, what's up, Mason?
you know, I always wanted to ask you... Where'd you get that tat, man?
the navy.
the navy? I was in the navy.
hospital ship, six years. You?
eight months.
Oh. You wash out?
all right, brother. You have a good one.
Yeah, brother.
not realising the rest of the world is watching and will take a cue from us...
the unprecedented attack on Chechnya signals a dangerous and troubling shift in Russian policy.
it demands the toughest and most unambiguous response from the West.
nato forces are on their way to Chechnya to serve as peacekeepers and to provide humanitarian aid to victims of this monstrous...
I expected this.
Really?
what will you do?
nothing.
we will do nothing.
these are four hours old. Russian 12th, 15th and 2nd tank regiments.
why haven't they moved?
Nemerov's too smart to move them. - He speaks.
Jack, Nemerov's got, like, 19, 000 tanks. No way NATO can match that.
that's why he's not gonna move them.
it's like chess. He's thinking three moves ahead.
the NATO playbook says we can only stop him with tactical nuclear weapons.
and he won't risk a nuclear war over this.
I also think he's sending us a message. He didn't bomb Grozny.
excuse me. I'm looking for Mrs Spassky.
at the end of the corridor.
I haven't seen Sasha since university.
and you were his teaching assistant? Strange, I don't remember you.
when he heard I was in Arzamas, he asked me to look in on you.
he says he'll take me to the West. - That would require a lot of money.
just because the imbeciles here pay him nothing doesn't mean others won't.
he has a secret job.
for the government?
for imbeciles with money.
same nonsense, do this, don't do that.
they even told him not to call his mother.
the pigs.
I could die any day and he can't phone his mother.
but my Sasha, he called.
just last night.
Clark got us her number.
NSA traced calls to that number back to here.
it's an abandoned Soviet army base on the Kremenchug reservoir.
what are three Russian atomic scientists doing in Ukraine?
a fair guess, they're building a bomb.
Nemerov has thousands of bombs. Why would he build a secret one?
deniability.
build one nobody knows about, he can drive it to Chechnya in his Beemer.
no way to track it, no way to trace it.
he could set it off and say, "I didn't do it.
with respect, I don't think that adds up.
it adds up. You just don't like what it adds up to.
Ah, the warmth of plutonium decay.
it's completely corroded. At least you're wearing gloves.
anyone want to light up an American cigarette?
you're crazy.
I'm going out.
the explosive blocks must be replaced.
machined to a thousandth of a millimetre in a mathematically determined configuration.
do we have a bomb? - First we must analyse the yield...
do we have a bomb?
Yes.
Yes, we do.
this is a... a test.
answer it.
answer it. - Are you sure?
Hello?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
I have to go outside for just a second.
OK? I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.
sir, I write reports. - I reviewed your military records.
you can take care of yourself. - Yes, sir. But I'm not trained for that.
I'm not asking you to be an operations officer, just my eyes and ears.
I can't go.
so... this isn't sanctioned.
I want you to give this to Clark, see what he finds out, bring it home.
Yes, sir.
Jack...
we never had this discussion.
what discussion?
OK. Clark... So this is three days ago.
it shows vehicles here. Guards here and here.
I gotta get one of those.
now, the infrared satellite took this photograph 34 hours ago.
that shows guards here and here.
I don't even have e-mail.
there are two at the checkpoint, between two and five in the barracks and two with the package, which we believe to be here.
no problem. Give me a couple of guys, some tranquilliser darts, we can be out in six minutes.
there is a problem. - What's that?
this is yesterday. No guards visible at all.
why is that a problem, Mr Ryan?
for two reasons. Either we can't see them, which is bad, or worse, they left, and we're too late.
suit up.
what? - You can't go dressed like that.
no, no. I'm an analyst. I don't go on missions.
relax, 007. It's not a mission. It's just a recce.
OK, fine, whatever you call it. I don't do that. I just write reports.
OK. So write a report about it. Suit up.
Clark, no.
Clark... no.
so, Cabot tells me you got my ticket to the correspondents dinner.
have a good time? I've never been to one of those.
I was actually looking forward to it.
Clark, no. I'm not going in there.
goddamn right. You're gonna stay here and make sure no one steals my boat.
be right back.
damn.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, God. Immigration didn't call you guys, huh?
I'm sorry. You speak English?
I don't speak much Ukrainian.
it's not what you think. I'm an American citizen. I have my papers...
OK. No papers.
please. Just put the gun down.
the light? You want me to put the light down?
OK. Take it easy. I'll put the light down.
here we go, I'm putting it down.
shoot him, Ryan.
shoot him.
shoot him before he figures out what I'm saying.
get their shoes. - What?
tell them to take their shoes off.
you speak Ukrainian. - Yeah. You don't?
whatever it is they were spray painting was big, about the size of a fridge.
the imprint it left was deep. So we know three things.
it was heavy, something was radioactive, and now it's gone.
one of them spoke English? - South African.
so, what's a South African doing in the Ukraine with three Russian scientists and a crate from Israel?
tell Cabot I'll call him from Haifa. - I have a feeling you better hurry.
most people believe the 20th century was defined by the death struggle of communism versus capitalism and that fascism was but a hiccup.
today we know better.
communism was a fool's errand.
the followers of Marx, gone from this earth.
but the followers of Hitler abound and thrive.
Hitler, however, had one great disadvantage.
he lived in a time when fascism, like a virus, like the AIDS virus, needed a strong host in order to spread.
germany was that host.
but strong as it was, Germany could not prevail.
the world was too big.
fortunately, the world has changed.
global communications, cable TV, the internet.
today the world is smaller and the virus does not need a strong host in order to spread.
this virus is airborne.
one more thing. Let no man call us crazy.
they called Hitler crazy, but Hitler wasn't crazy. He was stupid.
you don't fight Russia and America.
you get Russia and America to fight each other and destroy each other.
what did you find? - Ukraine's exports are online.
I pulled up the shipping manifests.
the only crate that size was picked up at Kiev International ten days ago and flown to the Canary Islands.
the air force has a nuclear assessment team. Call them...
Jack, it got put on a cargo freighter, headed for the East Coast.
what? - Baltimore. It's coming here.
it's a great view from the Budweiser blimp as we count down to game time.
we'll have the pre-game festivities as well as the arrival of the nation's number one football fan in a moment.
then conquer we must.
for our cause it is just.
and this be our motto.
in God is our trust.
and the star-spangled banner.
forever shall wave.
o'er the land of the free...
get me the duty officer!
home of the brave.
ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States,
robert Fowler!
showtime.
shit.
15 yard penalty, first down.
that's the way!
shit.
hello.
Hello? - Sir!
Hello? - Sir!
shit!
Cabot. - It's Ryan.
what? - The bomb is in play.
the AFRAT team are meeting me at the docks in 20 minutes to try to find it.
what docks? - Baltimore.
you're breaking up. What did you say? - Baltimore.
I'm losing you. I'll call you back... - Baltimore.
sir!
John! Red-Green! Let's go! Let's go!
move it! Let's go!
move! Go, go, go, go! Move!
what the hell is going on?
some Russian scientists made a nuclear bomb. It's arrived in Baltimore.
get those people out of the stadium. - Stay down!
the President has been taken off the field.
407. - Thanks, JJ.
clearly something has happened of tremendous proportions.
we have no word as to what but there is an enormous cloud over...
go, go, go!
mr President! Are you all right?
he's stuck. Get out of the way.
mr President, are you all right?
are you all right, Mr President? This is the marines, sir.
I need your help, Danny.
Alvarez, get me a stretcher, now!
you got the stretcher?
you got the stretcher? - No, I don't want one.
let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
move it!
move it!
go, go! Close them off! Go on up!
mr President...
there's been a nuclear explosion in America. You must come with us now.
what?
we don't know who or how. But it wasn't us.
after Grozny you hope it wasn't us.
we are drafting a strong denial for you.
and a statement of sympathy.
and Yuri... order all military on the alert.
Hey! It's Ryan.
Jack, where are you? - Somewhere outside Baltimore.
Cabot got the President out. - Where is he now?
they're taking him airborne.
on NAOC. They think it might be the Russians.
it wasn't the Russians. I gotta talk to Cabot. Patch me through to the plane.
Cabot's not on the plane.
we don't know where he is. Call back in an hour.
we don't have an hour. Fowler's gonna want to hit back now.
listen. We have to prove it wasn't the Russians before he's convinced it is.
can you get back to Langley?
there's no time. The radiation assessment team, where are they?
Stambler Tunnels, south of the city.
Stambler Tunnels, south of the city.
the prevailing winds are blowing the fallout to the east and north.
as long as you stay south you're OK.
mr President, are you all right? - How the hell do you think I am?
how many casualties? - We don't know.
how the hell did it get there? - We don't know. Radar didn't pick it up.
well, how is Cabot? Where is he? - I don't know.
what do you know? - I don't know, all right? I don't know!
I don't know!
general, Kondor is not on board. - Send the AFRAT team.
mr President, I recommend we move to DEFCON-2.
Where's our intelligence?
russian air defences are at their highest level.
maybe they're afraid of being attacked. I can't get this goddamn chair open!
we're about to take off.
we don't know who did it... - We think the Russians...
you think? - Sir, DEFCON-2.
we're groping in the dark... - This is too much goddamn bullshit!
and not enough fact.
the blast crater is about 100, 150 yards wide, which suggests a low-yield device, quite a bit smaller than the Hiroshima bomb.
a quarter of a square mile around the stadium is just gone.
beyond that, buildings remain, heavily damaged, for another quarter mile.
the damage tapers off the farther you get from Ground Zero.
Dubinin.
Herr Haft has left for America. Now we are counting on you.
I assure you, I will earn every pfennig.
attention.
you've heard of the bomb in the USA.
what you haven't heard is that 15 minutes ago an American ICBM hit Moscow.
we are to retaliate against an American aircraft carrier in the North Sea.
man your aircraft.
the ash isn't radioactive.
the winds are blowing the fallout to sea.
captain. Jack Ryan, CIA.
Lorna Shiro. You need to wait outside.
I need to know all you know about the bomb.
we're collecting samples. Get in line and we'll have the report out tomorrow.
captain, I need to know now where this bomb came from, or even where it didn't come from or there may not be a tomorrow.
shit. Wesson, where are you?
about a quarter mile from Ground Zero.
this is about as far as we'll go. My feet are sizzling.
I'm getting rads nearly the limit of our gear.
OK. Cut the rover loose and get out. - Roger that.
Dillon, the crate the bomb was shipped in. Somebody had to sign for it at port.
customs must have a database. Get me a name. Where's Cabot?
no one knows. We're checking the hospitals.
have you tried Memorial? - He wouldn't be there.
no, I mean... Is it still...
it's Cathy's hospital.
as far as I know it's still there, but the phones are down.
all right. Can you keep checking? Thanks.
they could have launched a cruise missile.
we don't know that this is Russia. - We don't know it's not.
if they were sending us a message, they'd want us to know it was them.
except they could inspire the confusion we're going through now.
mr President, we're uplinked.
president Nemerov, there's been a major nuclear event in the United States.
loss of life is severe.
it was no accident. - It was not an accident.
we don't yet know where it came from, we don't...
we have not yet ascertained the source of this weapon. Rest assured...
we have not yet ascertained the source of this weapon.
but rest assured those responsible will be dealt with most severely.
he's fishing.
send our reply.
whoa, that was a little fast.
please accept the deepest sympathies of the Russian people.
if it was deliberate, this is a crime without precedent.
what madman would do such a thing and for what purpose?
you must believe that Russia had nothing to do with this infamous act.
it's canned. He prepared that in advance.
president Nemerov, we've no reason to suspect Russian involvement at this time...
but we will protect ourselves from further aggression.
he thinks we did this.
we must demonstrate the strength of our weapons.
they have to understand that attacking Russia would be suicide.
increase the alert status.
tao, EW. I'm picking up intermittent radar, bearing 020.
where?
now it's gone.
there. It's a weak signal.
tao, inbound contact.
multiples on the same bearing.
vampire, vampire! - Fast movers inbound.
I got seven, eight, nine of them!
the missiles definitely came from Russian aircraft.
Grennel thinks he can save the ship, but flight ops are out.
I ordered no such attack.
you must not respond to this action until we investigate all possibilities.
until we investigate all possibilities.
like you did in Chechnya?
mr President, who is in control of your armed forces?
you dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.
you dropped the bomb on Nagasaki.
do not lecture me on Chechnya.
lecture me on Chechnya.
mr President, we are now at a de facto state of war with the Russians.
John Clark was in Haifa yesterday. We have to find him right away.
Wow. Look at that gadolinium reading.
Yeah. The mass fraction is huge.
OK, connect me to Dillon. I'll hold.
there it is. Savannah River.
Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah, what?
they had a gadolinium problem.
hanford does it another way, and generate too much promethium.
hold on. Can you translate that into English?
this plutonium came from the DOE plant at Savannah River, February '68, from K reactor. We even know which part of K reactor.
wait. This is our plutonium? - Made in the USA.
Dillon, you've got to find Cabot.
are you advocating we launch a first strike?
it is not a first strike! There's already been a first strike, and a second.
don't you get it? - No, I don't get it!
I don't understand why we have to nuke them! It's not reasonable.
Sidney, goddamn it!
they practically sank an aircraft carrier!
their missile silos are hot. We're getting bullshit from Nemerov.
let's not forget how this started. They tried to kill me, remember?
don't fucking tell me to be reasonable!
please come to the triage tent on the side of the building.
we will help you find who you are looking for, but we are low on blood supply.
sir?
sir?
Hi.
what?
president? - The President's fine.
he's fine. Sir...
the bomb. The plutonium...
wife. - What?
wife.
your wife? I'm sure she's fine. She's in DC.
the blast radius wasn't that...
it wasn't that wide.
it wasn't that wide.
sir, listen to me.
the plutonium was ours.
John Clark's in Haifa to track down the arms dealer. I can't get hold of him.
I don't know what to do.
girl... girlfriend.
she...
she works in Baltimore, so...
I don't know.
Spinnaker.
what? - Spinnaker.
sir?
bill?
Yeah. We found the receiver address for the crate.
port of Baltimore. Can you get to the docks?
find the Transcon warehouse. The name on the manifest is Mason.
sorry, I need this truck.
come on.
shit.
sir, we've come up with another alternative.
a conventional attack on the airbase where the carrier attack originated.
it's a measured response. - Non-nuclear.
is it strong enough? - Smart bombs and F-16s.
can't afford for them to see us as weak.
they've got to know we have the guts to take it to the next level.
I think they'll get that message.
hit 'em.
eagles Nest, this is Eagle One. We have target acquired. Target is lit.
to make no response is to invite a greater attack.
american submarines from Norfolk and Kings Bay are putting to sea.
they carry Trident D3 missiles. A first strike weapon.
Fowler is not so insane as to launch a first strike.
perhaps he doesn't think it's the first strike.
once their Stealth bombers go up, we will have no choice.
that will be the sign.
how do we convince him not to launch his bombers?
maybe we should... - Bring our missiles to highest alert.
they'd be crazy to attack then.
can I have your attention?
the generator has gone out.
there's broken glass everywhere. Stay where you are. We will get back to...
OK, fine. Please, stay where you are. We'll get you one by one.
sir, can you hear me? Can you feel your arms and legs?
a 9% IV and morphine drip.
sir, we're gonna take care of you.
what have you got?
what do we do with the ones we know won't make it?
what do we do with the ones we know won't make it?
whatever we can.
what?
bill Cabot died.
I'm really sorry.
this can't be happening.
sir, we have a call from Langley.
thank you.
Becker. - This is Jack Ryan.
great. The Nemerov apologist.
sir, this bomb was not Nemerov. I know this guy.
you said that after Grozny. Put it in your report.
the plutonium...
seems unusual to find radiation poisoning here.
I have never seen such a thing.
that is why we published the case on the internet, to seek help.
how did he say it happened? - He will not talk about it.
was anyone else exposed to the materials that made you sick?
mr Ghazi, I'm not the police.
I'm a physician. I assure you anything you say stays between us.
my friend and I find bomb.
we sell to a man who buys such things.
was it this man?
other people may have come in contact with that bomb.
we must help them.
I am... going to die?
yes?
Yes.
his name is Olson.
he live in Damascus.
Oh, yeah. We're getting it all.
a nuclear strike on Colorado Springs would take out NORAD.
it would limit their ability to launch a counter-attack.
how many people live in Colorado Springs?
three or four hundred thousand.
mr President, to use nuclear weapons against the Americans...
...would be to cross a threshold.
they think we already have. Should we now wait for them to annihilate us?
I cannot stop what I did not start.
mr President, we need you to initiate snapcount.
what happens then?
we prepare to take out their land-based missiles with a nuclear strike, find and kill their subs, knock out the planes they have on the ground and mobilise our fighters to destroy the ones they already have in the air.
what are our chances?
David?
odds are we leave Nemerov in a pretty pickle.
he'll be left with, at best, a few hundred nukes, the ones we can't find.
mostly the... smaller, more mobile, less accurate kind.
all those can do is target our cities.
but he knows to an absolute certainty that we will respond against his cities.
I spent my entire adult life wanting to be president.
this is my presidency?
sir, I think he'll keep his 300 nukes as a deterrent against any future aggressor.
I think he'll push back from the table and call it a night.
I'm giving the order for snapcount. Maximum readiness.
Olson had wire payments of $45 million from someone named Dressler.
Olson had wire payments of $45 million from someone named Dressler.
Dillon, find out who Dressler is. Jack, I want you out of there.
I'm at the docks. - Look for the name Dressler.
no. Jack, get out. Dillon, call the Baltimore PD, give them the address.
wait for the cops. - I'll call you back.
who's Dressler?
where is he, goddamn it?
where is Dressler?
police! Put your hands up!
Where's Dressler? - Are you Jack Ryan?
Where's Dressler, goddamn it? - Let him go!
Where's Dressler? Where is he?
Langley said you might need help.
I gotta get to the Pentagon. - I think I can help you with that.
mr President.
their Stealth bombers have left Aviano.
that is the sign.
shoot them down.
God protect us.
mr President, they're scrambling their fighters. We're out of time.
Dave! - He has a heart condition.
get a doctor. - Mr President.
Where's your nitro? - I said get a doctor!
mr President. - Take him to my quarters.
Colonel, bring in the launch codes.
dressler's an Austrian manufacturer, billionaire.
his father was executed at Nuremberg.
he bought a seat in parliament and got booted out for saying pro-Nazi things.
Rudy, get me through to the President.
I can't do it, Jack. They're in the snapcount.
there's no way in. - Bullshit.
I can do that for you, sir. - No, it's fine. Got some dirt on it.
can I see it? We're on high alert. - I understand.
sir, put the card down. - Back off.
I am ordering you... - Back off!
step back now! I am ordering you to take a step back! Put...
general, there's a Dr Ryan from the CIA.
he wants to enter NMCC. He's unescorted.
what's he want? - You, sir.
I have a message from Director Cabot that I need to transmit over the hotline.
what's your authorisation? - I don't have one.
Where's Cabot? - Cabot's dead, sir.
I need to get this information sent.
not without authorisation. Get him out.
wait! General! The President is basing his decisions on bad information!
if you shut me out, your family and my family and 25 million other families will be dead in 30 minutes.
my orders are to get this information to the people who make the decisions.
I just need to send some information.
what makes you think the President will listen to you?
he doesn't have to.
how close are the bombers?
they're slipping in and out of radar over Poland.
activate the missile regiments.
the launch sequence takes a minute to process after you give the order.
before the order can be taken, an ID check must be performed.
mine is the... My number is...
...the third one... third number down from the top.
your orders, sir?
strike. - I'm sorry, sir?
I give the order to strike.
under the two-man rule, the order to strike must now be confirmed.
Bob, for the love of God.
just do it.
Sidney Owens, Secretary of State. It's the fourth number down.
the order to strike has now been confirmed by the two-man rule.
NMCC, strike order has been confirmed. Start the sequence.
we've got activity on the hotline. - They've had their chance.
no, somebody's talking to the Kremlin.
it says, "America has been the victim of a terrorist attack.
as you can imagine, there has been much confusion here...
and fear.
but we know the weapon was not Russian.
but we know the weapon was not Russian.
what the hell is going on?
type exactly what I say.
who are we talking to?
Ryan. I met you in Moscow with Bill Cabot.
he died today in Baltimore.
cut him off. - Launch sequence has begun.
two months ago, a neo-fascist named Dressler bought an A-bomb on the black market.
cut him off. - The system can't be cut off.
then get someone to stop him.
he paid three disaffected Russian...
is that we all inhabit this small planet.
we all breathe the same air.
we all cherish our children's future...
and we're all mortal.
I will miss... so very much talking to William.
me too.
perhaps from time to time you and I can talk.
Yeah, I'd like that.
what is this?
a modest gift for your engagement.
he... he just asked me this morning.
we haven't told anybody about it.
how... how could you possibly know?
plumbing is tricky. It's like surgery.
one mistake could mean death.
Mr. Lewis found the problem.
I can explain. He...
always been handy with the plumbing.
he's a genius.
and you helped, did you, Angus?
Yes, l...
I handed the tools. - And you, Kirstie?
no. I came to get Angus to show him the civil assistance manual.
it's getting a bit cramped in here, so off you go. Did a grand job, Angus.
Bye.
it's the pipes.
it's the air locks bubbling through, you see.
Angus was a great help.
so you said.
Oh, dear. Excuse me. That's...
the doctor warned me not to eat haggis for breakfast.
so it's something about the...
...texture of the innards mixed in with the suet that I just can't...
thank you, thank you. You've explained that quite enough.
shut your ugly gob. You bloody near got me sacked, you wee ingrate.
captain, we'll have that bathroom up and running by tonight.
Oh, wonderful.
would you allow me to organize a meal tomorrow evening?
as a token of our gratitude.
just the officers and yourself, of course, as guest of honor.
thank you very much. That'd be very nice.
excellent. Shall we say 8: 00?
what are we going to do?
one thing's sure, you need to get him out of the house.
but where can I put him? - In the loch.
No! I want Crusoe to stay. He's mine!
but he can't spend his life in a toilet bowl.
but he can stay with me. - Whatever the devil he is...
...he's meant to swim and be free.
the loch is loaded with salmon to eat...
...and there's plenty of water for him to grow and move around in.
you want what's best for him? - What's best for him is to be with me.
excuse me, sir. Mrs. MacMorrow.
anyone for champagne?
thank you. - That was very good, sir.
it was brilliant tonight, with the last change from the...
Mrs. MacMorrow, you look radiant.
in Scotland we call that a fib, captain.
let me introduce you.
I love to watch a man work.
go easy. - Don't we deserve it, eh?
gentlemen.
the king, the regiment...
...and the lady of the house.
the king, the regiment and the lady of the house.
well, gentlemen, technically speaking I'm not actually the lady of the house...
...but I suppose for tonight I'm happy enough to serve that role.
thank you. - She's charming.
here you are. Look what I've got.
don't be greedy now.
Angus, come quickly. I've something funny to show you.
I'll be back in a minute, Crusoe.
you're not going to believe this.
you're a fine woman, Gracie.
Gracie!
Oh, my God. I don't know what came over me.
just a bit of fun.
Where's the dog?
Oh, no.
do you know why I take two pairs of trousers onto the golf course?
in case I get a hole in one.
did you hear something?
no, no. Maybe this old house has one or two ghosts, huh?
Oh, I don't believe in such things, captain.
come here, you bloody mongrel.
I'm sure I can hear something.
Yes, that time I distinctly heard something.
crusoe, no!
what's that now?
come on, Crusoe! Get out of here!
take your hand off me, man. - Angus, come right back here!
crusoe, come back!
Mr. Lewis, what in goodness sake?
sorry, the name's Mowbray, ma'am.
what? - Sorry, ma'am.
the dog got loose, and I was trying to catch him.
I should say you failed at that.
Yes, ma'am. - You think it's funny, Mowbray?
no, no. It's a very serious matter.
you hold your tongue, man.
you're not in your stately home now. I'll not be taking orders from you.
that is quite enough.
go and collect Angus and take him to his room immediately.
Yes, ma'am.
crusoe? Crusoe, come back. We're all going to get into trouble.
Lewis, we've got to find Crusoe. He's gone.
Yeah, I know. I'll find the wee devil, and you go straight to your room.
but, Lewis... - Off to bed with you.
or your mom will have both our hides. On you go. Go.
where are you, you wee, smelly beast?
Angus. Angus. Angus, wake up. I found him.
can't we just put him back in the bathtub?
no. No, I don't think so.
Jings.
Lewis, do you know anything more about water horses?
I think it was... Aye, it was my Uncle Lachlan who first told me about them.
many years ago, there was a lost traveler...
...and he's weeping bitter tears because he cannot find his way home.
he'd given up hope.
then suddenly, who should appear at the bank of the loch to this traveler...
...but a sea spirit. A water horse.
the traveler, no fool is he, knows the water horse is a creature of magic...
...one that could grow 10 feet tall overnight.
so the traveler, he feeds the water horse, strokes it...
...flatters it with compliments. And finally the traveler says:
incidentally, water horse, my dear friend...
...l'm wondering, if you've no other pressing engagements...
...could I trouble you to carry me across the loch on your back?
show me the way home?
well, what happens? Does the water horse help him?
I don't remember.
what? Does the water horse help him or doesn't he?
well, it was so long ago that I heard it.
it either carries him across the loch...
...or it drags him down to the bottom to his watery death.
I'm not sure which.
here you go, your favorite snack.
Angus, run now!
Angus, run!
faster. No looking back.
Mowbray.
you're all wet, man.
you been fishing?
no. I went diving, to see all those submarines you're going to sink.
Oh, you like to mock the war effort, do you?
no. No, I don't.
our forces over there in Europe on the front lines...
...they're doing a great job.
I want you to stay away from young Angus. Do you understand?
I consider you a bad influence.
is that so?
I don't know if you're a spy...
...or a deserter, or just simply a coward, Mowbray.
but I'm gonna find out. - Oh, I see.
they took you away from the battlefront...
...to hunt for deserters and cowards. Well, I'm neither.
so you can take that Sassenach attitude of yours...
...back to where you came from.
you stay away from the boy. Do you understand?
I'll have a bit of breakfast.
wait, wait.
how does she feel? - Oh, respectable.
it's a nice one. - Get the net.
you've got a keeper, for sure.
I'd say it's at least a five-pounder.
Oh, my sainted mother! - What on earth is it?
it's a monster. - It's a big fish, all right.
no, it's a monster, a creature with horns. A devil!
I told you to stay off that drink in the morning.
it's a big fish, all right.
it's gigantic! - Oh, no!
cut the line. Mother of God, cut it.
are you mad? This is the biggest fish I've ever had on. I'm going to land it.
it's going to sink us! - Okay, okay. Cut the line.
cut the line before he drowns us.
for God's sake, hurry up. Hurry up!
did you see it?
I saw it. Whatever it is.
sir.
now, young man, your mother has asked me to enlist you in service.
you are completely aimless, and we're gonna give you some purpose...
...make a soldier out of you, all right?
left! Left, right, left!
left, left!
come on, lad, hurry up. War'll be over before you finish that spud.
that's very good, Angus. Put your back into it, lad.
left, right, left!
left, left. Left, right, left!
keep peeling. I'll be back.
very good. Now, on to the next one.
I want this vehicle spotless both inside and out. Right?
you understand your orders? - Yes.
you're in the army now. We have a way of addressing officers, don't we?
Yes, sir. - Good man. Well, carry on.
now, Edwards.
we need to lay down something for you.
we need to ensure that these grounds are unaffected by our presence...
you wally.
right away, sir. - Carry on.
Crusoe!
where are you?
I'm sorry I've not been to see you for a while.
I haven't been able to get away until now.
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
where are you?
crusoe?
holy mackerel.
Hello, boy.
careful, don't tip me over.
it's good to see you, boy.
wait! Don't go!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
this isn't so bad. It's fun, actually.
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
Crusoe!
what is it, Churchill?
slow down, boy. Heel!
shoo, shoo. Go away. Crusoe, go.
crusoe, go! Shoo!
I thought it was raining, but when I looked up, there he was.
no. - Big as a house.
so then what happened? - I held out my hand, "Now, Crusoe...
...you have to promise to greet me, not eat me.
did he greet you or eat you? - He ate me.
Yeah, right. That's why you're here.
like a sardine.
there was everything down there. - Come on.
there was even a shipwreck.
no. - Yes.
yeah?
and I could just see a treasure chest.
and there was money in it.
it was too far away for me to reach. - Yeah.
it was amazing.
ma'am.
did y... Ma'am?
did you need something, ma'am? - No. No. Thank you.
for what?
for making them laugh.
haven't heard them laugh like that in a long time, especially Angus.
he's a good lad, ma'am. - Yes, he is.
I used to make him laugh like that.
maybe you should try again.
what?
well, just give him a wee bit more of your time.
Yes.
Mr. Mowbray. - Please, call me Lewis.
Where'd you get your scar?
shrapnel.
almost took my arm off.
I was a gunner on a torpedo boat.
we were dive-bombed by a German plane, and I was firing at it.
next thing, woke up in the hospital.
is it still painful? - It's nothing.
I'm lucky, compared to what some people have to...
it's a good thing I didn't lose the arm.
I'd not be much of a handyman with one hand.
you know, I'd be a one-handyman. Sorry.
no. I'm... I'm sorry. Well...
you will tell me if it's troubling you, won't you?
lieutenant? - Yes, sir?
we had any news on this Mowbray character yet?
Yes, sir. I put my report on your desk yesterday, sir.
Mowbray's as clean as a whistle, sir.
county records show him born and raised in Dornoch.
enlisted in the Royal Navy, 1939.
unblemished war record.
injured in action, August 1940, and honorably discharged.
he's something of a hero, you might say, sir.
thank you, Wormsley, that'll be all. - Yes, sir.
the head on it!
and a tail like a crocodile, only bigger. Wasn't it?
you've been telling that story for a week, and it changes every time.
scales or skin? - Skin.
what's your interest, Jock?
interest? - Aye.
this is front-page news.
the Aberdeen Argus readers will want to hear of this.
not a word of this is to get out.
but Hughie, when the war's over, there could be tourists, excursions.
this could put our Loch Ness on the map.
I don't want it on the map. Just leave things the way they are.
if there's a monster in Loch Ness, the world has a right to know.
Aye.
well, it's a perfect day for it.
this is awfully nice of you, but you don't have to.
no, I want you and the children to see the important work that we're doing.
if it's a mammal, it can't stay underwater for six hours.
mammal, my arse. It's a monster, it can do what it wants.
you just be ready. This photograph will make us all rich.
aye, aye.
well, the first thing we did was to cut an access road...
...all the way to the top of the hill.
all the way up to the location. See?
sir!
I know we've been an inconvenience for you since we've been here.
but I think you'll be impressed by what I'm about to show you.
this location, obviously, has been strategically chosen...
...for the long-range views.
moray Firth in the east, Loch Lochy in the west.
now follow me. - Thank you.
now, here she is...
...our pride and joy.
now, before we fire up Victoria...
that's what we call her.
I need you three to remain here on the perimeter.
and you might wanna cover your ears. She packs a hell of a punch.
come on. Block your ears. - We will be firing down the loch.
let's see what sort of splash she makes.
all right, men. Walker.
the loch? No, he can't do that. - What on earth?
I should have told you, there's a creature there.
a water horse. He could get hurt.
what? Stop this nonsense and let them do their work.
no, Captain Hamilton. You mustn't! - Angus! Angus!
we're to remain over here.
mother, please listen. He hatched from an egg. I saved his life.
that is enough. - Mother, it's true.
he's telling the truth. You have to believe...
No! Stop! - Fire!
fire!
very good.
what happened?
did they kill Crusoe? That can't be the end.
no, no, no.
but it was the beginning of the end.
poor Angus was beside himself for his creature.
he got into terrible trouble.
No! Don't! - Hey! You!
No! Don't! - Control yourself, boy.
did I or did I not tell you to wait over there?!
Angus, this is not the place for us. Can someone drive us home, please?
certainly. Corbin. - Yes, sir.
Kirstie. - Anne.
the boy needs discipline, Anne.
the captain lost all respect in Anne's eyes that day.
all right, Corbin.
that creature'll never surface after that bombardment. Puddocks.
you bloody pests! - Aye.
and he blew a big hole in Jock's plans for fame and Jimmy's for fortune.
to the left! - Jimmy McGarry was a man...
...not to be lightly parted from a pound or a penny.
to the right! - He had seen the monster...
...and he was determined the rest of the world should see it too.
get out of the picture. - Aye, go!
off you go.
Aye.
we have got it. - We're going to be rich. Rich.
you can come in now, you daft buggers.
everyone had a tale to tell about the monster.
everyone except poor Angus.
he was sent to bed at 6 every night for a month.
even his goody-two-shoes sister...
...could not convince their mother of the truth.
and no one had laid sight of Crusoe...
...since the bombardment...
...until that fateful night.
blimey, that's it.
what's it? - The monster.
that's just what I saw.
if it's out there, I'll catch it.
let's go hunting, boys.
Angus. - Kirstie?
this is Lewis' idea.
if you tell Mummy I let you out, I'll deny it. Do you understand?
now everyone's talking about seeing the beast.
you have to get him to hide better or something.
Crusoe!
Crusoe! Come!
try again.
Crusoe! Come!
Crusoe! Easy, boy, it's me!
Lewis, what's happened to him? - He's gone wild, lad.
no. You're wrong.
you'll see.
Angus, be careful.
easy, boy.
I'm your friend.
no, Angus!
it was your idea to put him in the wild. You said it would be best for him.
I didn't know that they'd shoot at him.
this is your fault.
will it work?
soft spot. Back of the neck.
consider it dead.
did you shoot that plane down?
what?
the plane you were shooting at when you got hurt.
well, it's not something I brag about.
why not?
Crusoe. - Angus.
you hear that?
it's Churchill.
I think he's onto something. Good dog!
it's that dog. He'll tell everyone where Crusoe is.
Wormsley, over there. In that cove. - I'll take her in.
kill the engine.
Where's he gone?
Churchill?
Oi, Churchill!
maybe he's just chasing a rabbit or something.
that's not it.
someone kill it! Kill it!
Mayday! Mayday! We're on the loch. And we're under attack!
where is he? - There it is, port side.
shoot it! Shoot it!
turn the boat around.
where is it? Where is it?
Anne.
look, I...
I don't wish to carry on like this. I apologize for my actions on the hill.
no, no. We should apologize.
Angus should never have behaved in such an inappropriate fashion.
sir! - I do...
sir! We just had a call from the loch. We're under attack.
what? - We're under attack, sir.
get me a sub. This could be it! - Right.
bring my jeep around to the front. - Yes, sir.
you take the children into the cellar. Wormsley?
kirstie, Angus, downstairs now!
Angus is... He's not here. - What?
he's gone down to the loch. - Oh, my God.
come quickly. Hurry, downstairs. Go, go, go.
this is not a drill. - Yes, sir.
Clyde, bring the car round to the front of the house straightaway.
I can't let you. It's too dangerous. - He's my son. You try to stop me.
go away from me!
go away. Go away from me!
Oh, my God. Please.
no. No, please!
Crusoe! - Go the other way. Turn around.
please! Go.
Crusoe! Stop! Put him down!
Oh, go away! - Stop it!
Crusoe! Stop! - Angus, no!
Crusoe!
No!
somebody! Get off me! Help. - Crusoe?
Angus? Can you hear me?
come on, lad. Come on, son. Come on, Angus, breathe.
come on!
if you have any magic in you at all, use it on this lad, I'm begging you.
put the gunners on high alert, understand?
any sign of an enemy vessel, you fire at will.
but, sir... - No. You fire at will!
come on. Come on, lad.
come on. Breathe, Angus.
come on, get some good Scottish air in those lungs.
stay with me, Angus. Stay with me, lad.
come on. Come on, lad, breathe. Come on.
come on, lad. Come on, we should go now.
know something? This old workshop is the place I'll miss the most.
you'll look after it for me?
and I'll bet you grow into these by the time I get back.
you keep them well-polished.
we'll have none of that.
you're the man of the house now. I need you to be strong and sure.
all right, Dad. Strong and sure.
Aye. That's my boy.
that's it. That's it. Good lad. That's it.
good boy.
crusoe?
that's a good water horse.
Thanks. Oh, God. - Captain Hamilton!
Angus!
he's all right. - Angus, what happened?
you got to kill it. - What's happening?
I was only trying to save Crusoe. - Who's Crusoe?
wouldn't believe me if I told you. - It's a sea monster.
it was just there...
what are you talking about? - I swear it. He was just there.
a sea monster? Are you telling me this has all been about a sea monster?
what is going on here?
has everyone gone mad?! A sea monster?
there is no monster.
there's just you with your bloody gun!
and you.
filling his head with tales of sea creatures and magic?
there's no monster. And there's no magic.
mother... - There's just...
there's just this war, and death...
...and people acting insane.
what's wrong with everyone?
Angus?
Yes, Mum. I tried to tell you. - Yes, you did.
his name's Crusoe. I raised him, right out of an egg.
Angus, be careful!
it's all right. He's my friend. He's peaceful, really.
he's not peaceful at all, sir. The damn thing tried to eat me.
Crusoe! Get out of here!
crusoe, come!
Crusoe!
Oh, my God. - Crusoe, come!
good boy.
come on. Over here. - No!
Angus!
Angus! Angus!
faster, Crusoe! We have to get to the net!
the sea. He's trying to get Crusoe out to sea.
victoria base, come in.
victoria base, come in.
you have to do something. You have to stop them.
all the radios are down. We have to get to the net.
all ammunition up here. On the double!
help!
No! No.
you were in the Royal Navy. That's right?
aye, sir. - Think you can handle this tub?
I see the channel. Now head to sea, boy, as fast as you can.
come on, keep it moving. - I see something.
the rain's too heavy to make it out clearly. It looks like a periscope.
good God, it is. A German sub. Prepare to fire.
fire!
go under, Crusoe. We have to go under!
there! - Where?
over there! Can you see them? - I can't see him.
Rapp! Situation report? - Sir.
one of our own torpedo boats is in pursuit of the target.
they're on the run. Don't let them get to the sea. Raise the nets!
faster, Crusoe!
go, Crusoe! Go!
what are we going to do?
Angus! - Over here!
Angus!
let him go! - Do as he says!
go on, boy!
Angus, let him go!
let go, Angus!
let go!
you're the best friend I've ever had.
I'll never forget you.
no, Crusoe! You can't stay here! Go and hide in the loch.
crusoe, go!
don't you hear me, you bloody fool? Do as I say.
go!
come on!
come on, Angus. - You're nearly there.
come on. - Come on, lad.
now give me your hand. Give me your hand, boy. Come on.
get him in the boat.
that's it. Good lad.
where is he? Where'd he go?
there he is!
he's gonna jump the net! - It's too high!
he'll never make it.
you did it, Crusoe! Well done, boy!
he'll not be coming back, will he?
I think he's meant to be on his own, dear.
not Crusoe. I meant...
...Daddy.
no, love. He'll not.
look! Look, Angus! Up here. - Up here!
you have to come quickly. - Look!
come on, quickly.
some say the creature comes back from time to time...
...looking for his friend.
some claim to have seen it over the years.
but the boy never saw it again.
that's a wonderful story.
Aye. And all true, every word of it.
thank you...
Angus.
Angus MacMorrow is the name.
he was so sweet. I know it's true.
it's a great story, but it's not true. - You are so cynical.
William?
William!
William!
William...
...where are you?
I just love mushrooms.
one of my favorites, or as I call it the king of mushrooms, is the porcini.
now, stop right there.
don't be alarmed.
there's a lot of confusion in this country between porcini...
the Italian name, and cpes, which is the French name.
they're fat and they're earthy.
now, the porcini is most often seen dried here in this country.
and they would always be labeled dried porcinis, not dried cepes. -Beck!
come on! -They are very, very, very flavorful.
it's about time. I've been waiting.
man, you're Iucky to be getting in. It's an extremely private party tonight.
what's he drinking? - Jagermeister and cristal.
great.
security? - No, but we do have a slight problem.
have fun.
what's the problem?
that's your problem.
the guy on the Ieft is Jalil Johnson.
I think he's the Ieft tackle. - Jamal Johnson.
defensive end.
the best defensive lineman Notre Dame's produced in the last 20 years.
maybe ever.
the guy on his Ieft is Kambui Jackson.
he ran for 2000 yards last year, All-Pro five years in a row.
the guy in the headband, that's Fernando Lewis.
middle Iinebacker.
plays a lot like Ray Lewis.
he just hits harder. - Whatever. I'm not into football.
the other two guys are Jimmy coggeshell...
and David Mulaire.
one's from USC. The other one's from Ohio State.
stay down, bitch!
the guy you're Iooking for is there. Brian Knappmiller.
throws like Brett Favre.
bets like Pete Rose.
so I'm telling this cat, I'm Iike, "Yo, I know it's you that jumped."
I saw you. Don't tell me it's not you.
he's Iike, "I don't know."
excuse me. -Trust me. It's you, I know.
excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you guys.
I apologize. I need. - My man.
I ain't got no hookups to tryout camps. You just gotta show up.
I think you'II be all right.
so I'm telling the cat, "I don't want."
excuse me. I'm not here to talk about tryouts.
if I could have a minute-- -I got it. Pass me that.
who do I make this out to, man?
who do I make it out to? What's your name?
Beck. - Beck?
B-E-C-K.
what's up? - What's happening?
here you go. Knock yourself out.
aII right? - Thank you.
what are you gonna do? Are you gonna come back, or what?
excuse me.
I'm really. - What are you doing, man?
a couple of months ago, you made wagers with an associate of mine.
two, three months ago. -What's up, Knappy?
nothing. It's good. Enjoy your drink. -What's up?
yo, bets? You embarrass me in front of friends about bets?
I don't mean to embarrass you. This is embarrassing to me.
$50, 000. You might remember. -Yeah, I know what it is, man.
listen, there's a G to get me started. Now do me a favor.
tell your man I'II see him Monday with the rest...
and not to send anybody else to see me, all right?
Brian.
I'm gonna need some collateral from you.
what?
I'm gonna need the ring.
I'm sorry. -You're--? Are you--?
sIip it under the table, on the Iow-Iow..
I'II make sure you get it back. - On the Iow-Iow.
I'II give it to you. Want a drink too? - Thank you.
take the ring. That's what I think about that.
get the hell on, man. Go, man! Go!
do something with this. -You heard the man.
yo, man, get up!
okay.
Yeah, that's right, playboy, walk. Go on, man!
you wanna jump?
get your ass out of here.
you all right?
this shit burns.
Hey, it's me.
Oh, yeah, he's here. We got a problem, though.
he's got the entire offensive Iine. The entire offensive Iine is here.
let me do it another night. How about that?
they've got a shot at repeating this year.
I do not want to hurt them. I don't want to go out.
okay, Billy.
Knappmiller! You got two choices.
option A, you give me the ring.
option B, I make you give me the ring.
I'II take B.
wrong choice.
okay.
Yeah, put him down, man!
yo, what's with all this hostility? -You should have taken option A.
are you all right, mate?
are you okay?
Thanks, mate.
there he is. - Why'd you send him, Billy?
Martin? Oh, he was just a backup.
after I got your call, I wasn't so sure you could deliver.
what happened? - He stole it from me!
he got you with those beanbags? No.
it is gonna be 1 0 off your vig, anyway, you know.
Billy, you know I've got plans! Stop nickel-and-diming me.
it's a tough business, the restaurant business.
I hear 75 percent of them fail the first year. Do you know why?
Undercapitalization, that's why. I don't think.
Billy, I want out, I want a new Iife. I want my money, and I want it now!
now?
now.
okay.
one job.
one job, I wipe your slate clean...
and you have your restaurant.
come on, open it up.
come on.
that's a photo of Travis AIfred Walker.
stanford dropout, treasure hunter. Only to date the only thing he's found is trouble.
did you say, "Walker"? -My son.
from my third marriage. Lasted about three minutes.
that picture was taken two months ago in some gold-mining town called EI Dorado in the middle of the Amazon.
how much? - 250 Iarge.
for that much, why not invite him back yourself?
the boy doesn't trust me. - Kidnapping's gonna help.
is that sarcasm?
you wanna be sarcastic, do it to your monkey friends!
you do not do it to me! Do you understand?
I'm sorry, Billy.
you're goddamn right you are.
What'd he do? - Pissed off the wrong people.
I don't have to remind you what happens when you do that, do I?
so I bought him some forgiveness.
but if I don't bring him back to face the music...
you know damn well that I can't carry a tune.
so you deliver my boy back here, you bring him right through that door...
you walk out of this house a free man, with a restaurant.
is that duct tape?
don't worry there, Iittle fella. Walk by faith, not by sight.
will you Iook at that? We can't Iand now.
Why? Why can't we Iand? -They got the bulls on the ground.
"booze on the grind"?
the bulls. On the ground. cattle down there.
cows? -Yeah.
I'II give them a wee fright there. Get moving! come on!
out of me way!
out the way, you!
move it! Move it now!
out my way!
out me way!
aII right there, Iittle fella. Okay, gotcha.
what did I tell you about the Iamp? My needle was totally knackered.
rpm's all over the shop.
is this the only road in and out? - If you wanna stay alive.
why is that? - There. That's the jungle, Iittle fella.
you got anacondas in there.
poison arrow frogs, black flies, bullet ants.
if they don't get you, the rebels will.
what? -Rebels. That's what I'm telling you.
to them, cornelius Hatcher's built a Babylon in paradise.
built a what? - A Babylon.
Yeah, that mine is as close as a man can come to the gates of hell...
while his heart's still beating.
the Sunday school picnic is over, I'II tell you that.
stay out of the jungle, Iittle fella, okay?
I found these flowers growing in the deepest parts of the jungle.
I mean, as far as I can tell, no one's ever identified them...
which means I'm responsible for naming them.
I can only think of one word that fits something so beautiful.
Mariana.
how much do you want?
what? - How much?
I need your uncle's boat. A day or two, max. Mariana
you borrow my car, bring it back with no windshield.
my brother's scooter. -That wasn't my fault.
now you want to borrow my uncle's boat?
"I found it, I found it." You'II never find this Garbo of yours.
it's "Gato," I told you. - Gato.
it's out there, Mariana. I know exactly where it is.
but I need that boat.
how much? - I told you, I.
no. How much is your Gato worth?
this is a very significant academic find.
how much? - It's not about money.
you Iie Iike a Iittle girl, Travis. - I'm not Iying.
if I get the boat for you, you have to take me with you.
ridiculous. We're talking about a boat.
and we split the take 50-50. - I've been doing all the work, okay?
I found it. No way. -50-50, Travis.
70-30. -50-50.
60-40. -50-50, and I get off work at 6.
then we can go and get your Gato.
you're evil.
thank you. - Whatever.
for the flowers.
Harvey! We're here to see your brother.
Where's he from?
he's an American. - You got a gun?
no, I don't Iike guns.
check him.
what's the current payout? - Give me a payout for Quadrant 3.
2425, down 20 percent.
checked him?
aII right, Iet's go.
come on.
come on.
I never met an American who didn't Iike guns.
tell them to dig harder.
if only it were that simple, eh, Mr. Beck?
how do you know my name? - When a man of your dimensions travels all this way to visit a place Iike this.
it arouses the curiosity.
what can I do for you?
do you know this man?
Travis Walker.
I Iet him excavate around the mine...
allow him to rent a room in my town all for a fair 60 percent of anything he might unearth.
where can I find him? -Follow the bullshit.
guy's mouth should be in the circus. -Brother, please.
do you have business with him? - I do.
what kind of business? I Iove business.
it's personal. - So...
why come to me? -When I'm a guest in a man's house...
I don't reach into his refrigerator without permission.
refrigerator.
I want to show you something, Mr. Beck, please.
does that Iook Iike a refrigerator to you?
looks more Iike hell.
where you see hell, I see a spellbinding sense of purpose.
I see the value of keeping your eye on the ball.
when a bride slips the ring on her finger...
when a businessman lays his hands on a Rolex...
when a rapper gets a shiny new tooth, this is that cost, Mr. Beck.
my horror for their beauty. My hell for their Iittle slice of heaven.
somebody's gotta keep his eye on the ball.
that somebody is me, Mr. Beck.
I am down here every day keeping my eye on the ball.
that's just a simple fact of life.
and if you're bold enough to face that cold, hard fact...
you can make a Iot of money.
what do you want with the kid? - I've come to take him home.
that'II cost you $1 0, 000.
I need to borrow the jeep. - Wait a minute, friend.
I'II give you $1 000.
I'II give you $1 000.
I need you to take my bag back to the plane, keep the engine running.
can you do that? -For $1 000?
that's right. - I'II find a way.
Declan. I'm gonna be coming fast.
American?
Yeah.
where from?
someplace that's got bartenders.
what can I get you?
I'II take a beer.
nice flowers.
the smiling fool.
back in the States, Brazil nuts Iike these go for $15 a pound.
well, those fell off the tree out back.
and around here, we don't call them Brazil nuts.
what do you call them? - Well, we're in Brazil...
so we just call them nuts.
fair enough. - What brings you to the Amazon...
other than the food and drink, of course?
I'm Iooking for a man. - What's your type?
his name's Travis Walker.
brown hair. He's in his 20s. Wears a blue shirt, jeans.
right now he's got a real bewildered Iook on his face.
do I know you? -Name's Beck.
what can I do for you? - I need you to make a choice for me.
a choice?
option A or option B. - What's option A?
option A is, you and I walk out of here nice and easy...
and drive back to the airstrip.
and then we begin our Iong journey back to Los Angeles.
There'II be no blood, no broken bones...
and no problems.
what's in Los Angeles? -Your father.
what's option B? - Pretty much the opposite of A.
but I wouldn't recommend that one.
I'II take option c.
Travis, there is no option c.
Really?
are you sure?
I mean, big boy, there's always an option c.
so angry!
shut up. -Shut up!
like I said, there is no option c.
let me introduce you to option c. - Mr. Beck...
there's been a slight change in the narrative.
an unexpected twist, you might say. - Can I have a beer, please?
Mr. Hatcher, I was just gonna come find you when this.
the kid stays.
I paid you. -Well, fortunately...
I had my fingers crossed the whole time.
apparently, young Mr. Walkermay have stumbled onto a trinket of value.
and as he's Iocated it in my jungle...
I'm gonna need him to Iead me to it.
okay, so Iet's go, dickhead.
don't call me a dickhead, you dickhead.
did you find it or not, asshole? - What, asshole?
did you find it or not? -What's that?
did you find it or not, asshole? - Don't!
Hey, don't rock the boat.
okay.
I don't want any trouble. - Leave now. Don't come back.
and the 10,000? - Consider it tax deductible.
a contribution to your personal health fund.
with all due respect, Mr. Hatcher...
I'm feeling pretty healthy. - Oh, yeah?
walk.
don't make waves.
you're gonna kill us all, Mr. Beck?
I tried to be reasonable.
that's not the way to do business.
you should've kept the gun.
you're dead already. You just don't know it yet.
this is option B? Are you kidding me?
this is option B? Are you kidding me?
quiet.
you're dead. You're so dead.
we won't get out of here. AII this Iand, Hatcher owns it.
the road, the air, Hatcher owns it all.
shut up. - Whatever my dad is paying you...
I will double it. - No.
I'II quadruple it. - No.
double it and quadruple it. - No.
you're being unreasonable!
I'II give you a chance to reconsider. - You get one more chance to shut up.
is that your final answer?
for what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the fall.
Yeah, what fall? -This fall.
come on, big boy, where's the frigging keys?
aII right.
Travis?
good God!
Travis!
I'm not going back. -Oh, you're going back.
no way.
right now. -Who the hell do you think you are?
you come into my town, mess up my bar...
and you eyeball my woman? - Eyeball your woman?
it's on.
what's this?
who is this? Is he your friend? Do you know him?
do you? Say hello.
say hello. Say hello.
are you finished? Let's go.
big boy, you Iike thunderstorms?
bet you do, right?
little thunder? - Stop it.
little Iightning? - Stop!
thunder? Lightning? Thunder? Lightning?
you done beating me up? Let's go.
I'm tired of this. -You win.
come on! Go to sleep.
go to sleep. Night-night.
Night-night. Go to sleep now! come on!
obviously, we got off on the wrong foot here.
so I'm gonna be completely candid with you.
have you ever heard of the Gato do Diabo?
the Devil's cat? -You're gonna stop speaking now.
aII right. It's.
it's a priceless object, man.
forged out of pure gold.
worth millions. -You said priceless.
you do not want to argue semantics with a Ph. D. candidate.
ph. D? -Yeah.
I am really very close to being Dr. Travis Walker.
you dropped out of Stanford after two semesters, Einstein.
so I'm fairly close. closer than you.
close to getting your ass kicked again.
wait, wait, wait! The Gato is real, all right?
I know where to find it.
I'II split it with you, 80-20. - Move!
70-30?
you're a very unpleasant individual, you know that?
you think they're dead?
what am I, psychic?
I'm gonna cut that kid's nose off.
no, Harvey.
you want the Gato because if the bad guys get it...
they won't need us anymore.
There'II be no one to work the mine. You want to work the mine?
there are two men in that jungle who are trying to steal from me.
I feel Iike a Iittle boy who's Iost his first tooth...
put it under his pillow, waiting for the tooth fairy to come.
only, two evil burglars have crept in my window...
and snatched it before she could get here.
wait a second. Do you understand the concept of the tooth fairy?
explain it to them.
you find a tooth, you put it under your pillow.
the fairy comes waiting for the tooth.
wait. She takes the goddamn thing, gives you a quarter!
they got my tooth!
I want it back.
I have to ask you, back at the bar, man. That was crazy!
no guns. Strip, toss, toss, strip.
didn't I tell you to be quiet? - I know, but what is that?
some kind of nouveau samurai code? You got a problem with guns?
they take me to a place I don't wanna go.
where do they take you?
to a place you don't wanna see me go. Walk!
how often do you work out?
let me get this straight.
you never use guns? - No.
never? -Never.
what if your best friend was gonna die?
no guns.
Santa would do it to save his best friend.
do I Iook Iike Santa claus?
do I Iook Iike Santa claus to you? -What is it?
guns make you um pouco louco? Bang-bang crazy?
I pick up guns, bad things happen. I don't Iike that.
what kind of things? -Very bad things, Travis. Walk.
what about knives? -Move!
my father doesn't share the same distaste.
he's your father. He won't kill you. - All he cares about is what's good for business. Now, the question is, Mr. Beck...
what's good for your business?
you don't Iike money?
I don't make deals with people Iike you.
you don't even know me. -You're Iike every jackass I take down.
first they try to run, then fight, then they try to negotiate.
when that fails, they do what you're about to do when you realize it's over.
Oh, yeah? What's that?
you're gonna get down on your hands and knees and beg me for a break.
well, guess what. I don't give breaks.
no breaks.
you don't understand the situation.
you borrowed money from the wrong guy.
you slept with the wrong guy's wife. I don't care.
your mistake.
what about you, Mr. Beck? Haven't you ever made a mistake?
I know! Move.
no breaks. That's Iame.
no breaks! No, I don't give breaks.
Santa claus doesn't give any breaks.
should've been at the airstrip by now. - Like I'm gonna help.
I didn't ask for your help.
what are you doing? - I have to pee.
pee in your pants. Move. -No.
I've Iet you push me around this jungle for, Iike, five hours.
you've been very aggressive, and I'm not moving until you Iet me pee.
if you wanna keep going, you'II have to carry me. I'II pee on your head.
you threatening me? You threatening me with pee?
well, yeah, if you don't Iet me pee here.
fine. You win.
pee.
will you unzip me? -No, I won't.
you wanna pee, you got 30 seconds. - How can with I my hands cuffed?
find a way. Pee.
come on.
don't make it weird.
pIease?
don't breathe, don't say a word.
don't even Iook at me. Look over there.
Thanks, man.
Oh, shit.
I can't get it out!
could you just help? - No. Hell, no.
come on! Son of a-!
come on, come on!
come on! Oh, hey. Hey, I got it.
Congratulations. You got 30 seconds. Hurry up.
don't Iisten to Tiny Tim, okay?
you're the real big boy. Everybody knows it.
ready? One, two, three, go.
one, two, three, go, go, go, go!
Oh, yeah.
I'm going.
Oh, boy.
what--? What is this?
what is--?
Travis! Hey!
welcome to the jungle, tough guy!
looks Iike big boy got himself pig-snared!
Hey! Hey! I've got the keys to your cuffs.
shit. -I'II tell you what you've got, pal.
you've got problems. - That's-- Don't do it, Travis.
Hey. Hey, get me down. Travis.
Oh, what's this? Is this your diary? Your Iittle journal?
give me that. Don't touch that. -You want this? Get it!
come on, get it! Get it! come on! come on! Yeah, yeah!
Oh, yeah, come on! Get it! Get it!
give it to me!
you're Iike a Iittle birdie up there!
I will kill you. You better give me that book.
shrimp and pea risotto with basil and mint.
are you a chef? - None of your business. Give it back!
looks Iike you're Wolfgang Stuck right here.
Travis! Travis!
Hey! I Iet you pee. - Oh, yeah, you did. You did.
thank you so much. Do you have to pee?
well, you got 30 seconds. Go ahead and pee.
Oh, shit.
Hey, I was kidding about what I said. - Give me the book.
I don't want it. I don't want it. -Turn around.
why you always gotta hit me? -Now Iisten to me.
we gotta get to this tree. Let's go back to back.
aII right. Okay.
kick your Iegs! - I'm trying! I'm kicking my Iegs!
where are you? - Grab me. Grab my back, not my ass.
got it? - I got it. Got it.
Oh, great! You did it!
now what? - Put your arm over me. Get to the tree.
listen. -You're Iike Joe Pig-snare?
put your arm over me!
just stop moving! -The vine. You gotta grab the.
what was that?
Oh, shit. - What was that?
monkeys.
steady.
steady.
steady.
steady.
steady!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
do not fight them!
Oh, my God!
what's he doing? What's he doing? - He's humping you, he's humping you!
what's he doing? - Establish dominance!
establish dominance!
get him off of me!
he's humping me! Make him stop!
the ears! Get the ears.
who's that? - It's the rebels.
don't worry, they're my friends.
God bless you!
say hi.
Hi.
these are your friends, huh? What, are you kidding me?
I'm starting to Iong for a monkey with a hard-on.
whatever happens, just keep Iooking into his eyes.
won't that offend him? -No.
whatever you do, do not blink. They're Iike grizzlies.
just shut up and Iet me take care of this.
we know you work for Hatcher. Were you tracking us?!
he thinks we work for Hatcher. - Well, tell him the truth.
fierce gaze. Fierce gaze. Fierce gaze.
honorable host, unlike this man on my Ieft, I do not work for that evil scum.
why does the giant stare at me without respect? I will cut out his arrogant eyes!
what's he saying? -Shut up. Just hold his gaze.
he is Hatcher's assassin. Paid to hunt all who oppose him, including me.
why do I get the feeling you really suck at Portuguese?
what did he say?!
he says he pisses on your ancestors...
and that you would make a very pretty bride!
what's going on? - He wants to fight you.
no. We're not fighting. Tell him I don't want to fight.
the assassin is a great warrior! Better to shoot him now and get it over with!
we are not fighting. - Don't worry, they're Iittle people.
what? -You could take them. They're Iittle.
you can win.
why do you want to fight? Why?
I just want to get back to the airport.
pIease. I just have to get home.
okay, hip-hop.
I don't want to do this. PIease. PIease.
Travis, tell them one more time I do not want to fight.
I'd Iove to help you out, buddy, but I don't think...
they're really Iistening to me anymore.
heads up.
that's okay! That is okay!
Hey, Kansas cities!
don't do it.
what is that? It's Iike spinning Tarzan jujitsu!
speedy Iittle bastards, aren't they?
head's gotta stay up.
I am not your enemy.
Mariana?
what are you doing here?
barmaid by day, rebel Ieader by night.
you are good! The whole time I was working you, you were working me.
I was hoping you might find O Gato do Diabo.
it couldn't have all been work.
could it? Man, that was some good work.
what do you think, Travis?
I knew. You know that, right? I totally knew.
of course.
Hey.
the herbs will keep it from getting infected.
why do you do this? - Pardon me?
why do you fight? - Because of 65 cents an hour.
that's what Hatcher pays the workers.
but in order to mine, you need tools.
you need food, clothing, a place to sleep.
you have no money, so, what do you do?
you borrow from Hatcher.
pick and shovel, a dollar a day.
a sack to haul the dirt, another dollar.
oid Mr. Beck knows a Iot about debt, don't you?
he knows what it's Iike to dig a hole so deep you can't climb out.
call it what you want. It's escravidao.
SIavery.
and we intend to stop it.
manito wants to know who would win a fight between Tyson and AIi.
aII, hands down.
he says, "What about Tyson's power?
shit. Tell him AIi would've done to Tyson...
what he did to Foreman in Africa.
rumble. Rumble in the Jungle.
tell him AIi was too smart.
too smart, too fast. Would've used his jabs. Bam, bam!
would've danced.
would've played with his mind.
before you know it, bam! Left to the body. Bam! Right to the head.
down goes Tyson.
FIoat Iike butterfly.
sting Iike bee.
FIoat Iike butterfly, sting Iike bee.
Yeah! - FIoat Iike butterfly, sting Iike a bee!
Yeah! - FIoat Iike butterfly, sting Iike a bee!
he says he thinks you are a great fighter...
and he wants you to have it.
it's for Iuck. - Tell him I'm sorry, I can't.
you'II offend him if you refuse.
I'm honored. Thank you.
you'II need all the Iuck you can get.
it's a Iong walk back to the airfield.
especially by yourself.
nice!
you don't understand.
I'm not going back without him. - Oh, here we go again.
fifty rifles say you are.
I will kill you. You better give me that book.
and we're rebels, not thieves.
Hatcher!
Travis!
let's clean it up.
not so fast, jungle boy.
move! Move!
come on!
Manito!
go, go, go!
Manito! - Let's go!
I want hunting parties.
small ones.
find them.
find them!
aII right, this is the way it's going to be.
you're going to take me to O Gato do Diabo.
and you're going to take me now. - calm down.
don't! You saw what they do. Don't ever tell me to calm down.
Travis, don't play with me.
or what? - Or I'm going to shoot you.
well, if you shoot me, you're never gonna find the Gato.
so we're gonna make a Iittle deal. - Deal?
you see? O Gato is an object to you. It's Iife on the Riviera, a private yacht.
you don't know anything about me. - For us it's hope.
my heart's breaking. It's Iike a telethon.
you selfish! - Enough!
sit down! Sit down!
holy shit, you tried to shoot me!
you saw it!
crazy. - Shut up.
shut up.
the deal's this. He takes you to the Gato.
you just show me how I get out of this jungle so I can take him home. Deal?
do we have a deal?
deal. - Let me get this straight.
she gets what she needs, you get what you need...
and I get the shaft. - I could always give her back the gun.
I really don't Iike you. - Yeah, well, I get that a Iot.
seriously.
what?
I was just wondering how it is you came to do...
you know, whatever it is you do.
it's a Iong story. - It's a Iong walk.
I grew up in a very rough place.
one thing Ied to another, that's all.
just Iike you. - Like me?
Yeah, you get pushed, you push back.
well, with me, I pushed so hard that word got around.
before I knew it, I was in a room full of the wrong people with the wrong money.
so you think I'm standing in a room full of the wrong people?
Yeah. Something Iike that.
I Iike you, Mr. Beck.
really.
but you and I are nothing alike.
Travis!
let's keep moving. Let's go.
what are you doing?
let's take us a Iittle swim, Wolfgang.
we're not swimming. Let's go.
come on, big boy. You could use a bath.
Travis, we have to keep moving. It'II be dark soon.
Why?
we're already here.
don't pee in the water. - Why?
a candiru, a vicious parasite, will swim up the urine into your pau.
come on, big boy! It feels good!
swim up my what? -Your pinto.
it'II swim up your ding-dong. And once it gets in, you can't get it out.
come on!
wait.
well, then what?
they have to amputate.
not this boy's pinto. Not today.
the hieroglyphic code...
said the great chief of the Marajo people put the Gato to sleep behind walls of a moving curtain. -A waterfall.
must be some kind of methane buildup.
it's cool. Let's go.
Oh, God! -Yeah, real genius.
you have no clue what you're doing. - Oh, shut up!
you obviously don't know anything about methane deposits.
Oh, and you do? - Shut up.
What'd you just say?
what is it?
why do I get the feeling we are not supposed to be here?
because we're not.
there it is! I told you it was real!
Travis, you're never gonna get back there. It's too dangerous.
the roof is coming down!
wait a second.
a jaguar.
I know what this is.
monkey.
eagle.
I can't hold this, Travis. - I know what this is.
what is it? - It's an 800-year-old safe.
this is how they kept their treasures protected.
there's a combination.
jaguar, cat. Gato, cat. It's gotta be the jaguar.
we pull the sticks closest to the jaguar, we'II be okay.
for 60 seconds, then the roof's coming down.
you're not gonna touch anything. Let's go!
aII right.
follow the jag.
follow the jaguar.
easy. Easy.
it's coming down, Travis.
what are you doing? Let's go!
pass it to me.
is that a jaguar? - I think it's an eagle!
Travis, hurry!
Oh, my...
here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
I did it.
I found you.
not some Oxford archaeologist or some stiff-ass Harvard professor.
I did it! I found you! - Who gives a shit?
how you Iike me now, huh, Beck?
go! Go! Move! Now!
run!
let's go!
move!
these are konlabos.
they're very rare.
you're Iucky.
and I wouldn't flirt with O Gato do Diabo's eyes if I were you.
they say it's dangerous. - What else do they say?
once restored to its rightful owners, the rivers will be Iaden with fish.
and the trees will grow tall, bringing shade for hammocks...
so its people may rest their backs.
you think bringing this Gato will do all that?
no, Mr. Beck. But I expect the money selling it brings will do just that.
we can buy seed, irrigate. Farm our own Iands.
free ourselves from Hatcher's mine.
when that statue hits the black market, it'II vanish forever.
it's a Iittle Iate for morals.
especially after you were going to do the same thing.
and 1 0 percent of that is going to pay for your freedom...
so I'd be a Iittle more grateful if I were you.
what if I told you I was gonna give it to a museum...
so the whole world could appreciate it?
you can tell me anything you want, Travis, but I know you.
what are you going to do after you bring him home?
I'm gonna open a restaurant. -Yeah. He's a killer in the kitchen too.
ten, 1 5 tables. Nothing fancy.
Italian. Southern Italian.
how do you...?
how do you...? How do you spell...
Konlabos?
konlabos, with a K.
don't worry. After four or five hours, you'II be as good as new.
the fire will keep the animals away until sunup.
I'm sorry...
but money has a way of changing people.
you did find it, Travis.
just Iike you said.
no one can take that away from you.
and I will send you the money buy your freedom. I meant that.
you kept your word, and I admire that...
so I'II keep mine.
go north until you reach the Quantana Road.
take it south all the way to the airfield.
good Iuck to you, Mr. Beck.
Oh, shit.
what? What?
what? -Monkey. Monkey.
monkey? Where? Just get him away from me.
get out of here. -Get out of here.
get out of here, monkey!
Oh, no.
I hate this place. -Get out of here!
I hate penis-eating minnows, and I hate freaky fruit.
get them away from me. - I wanna go home. I want concrete.
get out of here, monkey. - I want homemade tortellini.
I want my Los Angeles Lakers.
that's what I want. I want to go home. I want to go home.
I want to go home!
get out of here, monkey. Get out of here, monkey.
well, what about that?
been for a stroll, have you, boys? - Where's my bag?
Where's my jeep?
give me my bag.
you have any water?
sit down. How soon before we can take off?
you Ieft a jeep at the bottom of a mountainside.
I'II take care of it. - In a bloody Iarge puddle.
I said, I'II take care of it. -That jeep is dead, my friend.
look, you'II get your money.
just start the plane. - What's your big hurry?
I'm trying to Ieave before I run into Hatcher or more problems.
don't go worrying about Hatcher.
that monstrosity won't give a flying fornication...
for the pair of youse no more. He got what he was after.
what do you mean?
he caught up with poor Mariana in the jungle.
he relieved her of her artifact.
What'd you say? - I said, he relieved her of her artifact.
it's a word in the English Ianguage. "Artifact." Look it up.
son of a bitch. He's got my Gato!
your what? -The Gato. Don't you speak English?
Hey. Where is she? - Hatcher's got her in town.
he's torturing her for information. - He's doing what?
freedom fighters? Freedom fighters, my ass.
Lutadores de Louco, you ask me.
they're all gonna die.
come on. AII aboard.
come on.
what are you doing?
we made a deal. - A deal?
what the hell does that mean?
I'm here at the airstrip, she doesn't have the Gato.
gonna go in there by yourself?
no way. No way.
Hey, Hatcher's got a small army back there.
you don't know your way around the town.
Oh, wait. I got an idea.
saddle up to one of those bulls ride into town Iike a conquistador and challenge all of them to a duel.
Oh, yeah. I forgot.
you don't use guns.
what's your point? -You're gonna die, Beck.
the boy's right. You mind if we settle the bill now?
you need help.
are you gonna help me, Travis? AII you care about is the money.
no, Beck, you're wrong.
I'd rather die than Iet that son of a bitch get my Gato.
you need all the help you can get. You can even use him, for chrissake.
don't bring me into it. I got a dodgy knee here.
you can't do this on your own.
okay, Travis.
I know you're gonna run on me.
might not be tonight or tomorrow.
but I will find you, and I will take you back.
are we clear? -Yeah.
we'II both probably be dead in about an hour.
so Iet's cancel christmas.
your plan of attack was a bit naive.
man, if I was only 1 0 minutes younger, huh?
I suppose now we have a conversation where you enlighten me.
Mr. Hatcher.
how many more of you are out there? Enlighten me.
where are the rest of your compadres? Enlighten me!
Mr. Hatcher.
I don't get why you people are so hostile.
I've been good to you. I built you a town.
why are we fighting?
Mr. Hatcher. - What?
we've Iost contact with Outpost 1.
there's nobody answering.
Mr. Hatcher, are you out there? - What can I do for you, Mr. Beck?
I have no desire to fight with you or your men.
for that reason, you have two options.
option A, you leave the Gato and the girl...
and you walk out of town, no questions asked.
what's option B? - Option B...
I make you.
wrong choice.
lock down the town.
still no visual contact. Team two is checking the perimeter right now.
he...
that heard the sound of thy holy trumpet...
and took not warning...
he hath clearly wandered too far...
from the word of God.
and cornelius Bernard Hatcher...
your heir has come. Let's get it on, big boy!
it's time to get back on the path.
that's a Iot of cows.
Hi.
what nerve.
about bloody time, huh?
somebody just shoot him.
Oh, yeah? Oh, you want one?
Oh, okay.
a Iittle thunder? Huh? You Iike thunderstorms, big boy?
how about some Iightning?
ear, ear-- Ears, eyes, foot, face!
take the Gato and the girl and get to the airfield.
if you run into trouble, use her as a hostage.
and Harvey, when you're safely out of town put her out of my misery.
I need help!
do not go gentle into that good night, my Iovely.
Beck! I need help. Beck!
rage, rage...
against the dying of the Iight.
there shall be no mercyfor any force that stands...
blocking this path of his righteousness.
Beck, help!
help!
move!
no way.
give me back my Gato, you Iittle bald freak!
Oh, great.
see you.
you got the moves.
I'II give you that.
you reached into the wrong refrigerator, Mr. Beck.
hold your horses.
what have I done?
are we not men?
Hatcher. - What?
option A is still on the table. You can walk away right now.
option A doesn't work for me.
before I came here, what did you people have?
face it. Be fair.
I put a roof over your head, coin in your pockets.
you barefoot Indians didn't have pockets before Hatcher came along.
I gave you a Iife! I'm the heart in the darkness.
face it...
you can't run this thing without me.
I am pumping the blood of the modern world into your backward veins...
you stinking...
Ingrate...
Oompa Loompa...
morons!
okay.
that's it, I'm done.
Mr. Beck...
I'II take option A.
clear, please.
Oh, shit.
you make a hell of an entrance, Mr. Beck.
Yeah.
I'd offer you a beer, but I think you blew up my bar.
Yeah, I think you're right.
thank you.
we had a deal. -Yes, we did.
and I'm afraid I didn't deliver on that deal.
how is that?
the Gato.
I promised you the Gato.
Yes, well, I promised you Travis.
you all talking about this Travis?
and this Gato?
I'm impressed.
Yeah, well, make sure they spell my name right.
I told you it wasn't about the money.
well, big boy...
I guess it's your move.
I'm impressed myself, Travis.
Declan, start the plane.
Declan, start the plane"? What does that mean?
I'm taking you home. -Oh, I figured that.
no breaks. Good Iuck.
you too.
I will send you your cut.
move.
not a penny Iess than 1 5. 6 million. - Move, Travis.
you really ought to stay away from guns.
you ought to get yourself a psychiatrist. Seriously.
move.
well, Iook at him.
look at you. Your beard. You're Iike a real man.
but you're so thin. - Running is good exercise.
good exercise. That's funny. Did you hear him?
running for your Iife.
I Iove it. I really do!
you know there's not enough aspirin in the world for a headache Iike you? -Well, there probably is.
but I understand what you mean. -Well, that's good.
because that means you'II understand why you'II take that trip to chicago.
actually, I don't completely understand that one.
still the smart-ass. - I'm not that smart, Dad.
I didn't know she was married. -Well, she was.
very married.
and you. What took you so Iong, huh?
your kid was a tough rundown, Billy.
him? No. -Yeah, yeah.
but I did walk him right through that door, right? Like we agreed?
you did. - We good?
we're good. Two hundred and fifty Iarge.
you got your restaurant, kid.
now get out of here, huh?
before I Ieave...
when I was in Brazil, they showed me this ritual they do...
when they have big celebrations.
what they do is, they eat this fruit, and it's called konlabos, with a K.
so I figured before I Ieave, we could celebrate one Iast time.
come on, guys. Try some of this.
if he says it's good, it's gotta be. He's the best chef I know.
Billy, here, you try the first piece.
not bad.
big seeds, though. I don't Iike seeds.
Hey, what are you--?
I walked him right through that door, Billy.
boy...
you got a funny-Iooking face.
Hey, Dad.
I Iove you, you know that? I Iove you, you know that?
because you showed me something back there.
I thought you had character, but I wasn't sure.
you got it, man. You really got it! - Get in the truck.
you violated every agricultural Iaw. - That's the Ieast of my problems.
we should go back in there and finish him off.
you want to go back, go ahead.
knock yourself out. I'II wait for you. - I'm not going back.
right. So shut up, get in the truck before I change my mind.
don't push me.
what? - Don't push me.
I appreciate everything you did.
if you want to get technical, all you did is even the score. I saved you first.
get in. -You don't have to thank me.
but this pushing shit ain't happening no more. You read me?
okay. I'm gonna bust you up.
go for it.
Yeah.
Hey, remember your friend Mr. Thunder?
how about his buddy Mr. Lightning?
I know you know him.
you know him real well, don't you?
I'm just playing, man. I'II be in the truck.
I'm gonna kill you.
that's strange.
dad, it's beautiful.
my God. I've never seen anything like it.
cool!
so futuroic.
it's about time somebody showed up. Is this your place?
who are you? - I'm the power guy.
don't touch.
your house is knocking out the power of the whole tri-quad area.
I need to get inside and check the breakers.
could you come back tomorrow? Is that a possibility?
tomorrow? Let me see.
there are about 5, 570 houses right now without power.
my bosses kind of frown on that, so...
well, that's not really our problem, is it?
look, buddy, I've been doing this job for about three weeks.
is there any way you can give me a break here?
sure.
no problem.
thank you.
Mr...?
Kriticos. Arthur Kriticos.
it's quite a place you've got.
Yeah. We're moving in.
one step at a time.
that's odd. -Dad, you broke it.
Bobby, give it a rest.
hello.
Wow! You can see right through it.
you guys couldn't afford any walls?
how weird.
guess Uncle Cyrus wasn't too keen on privacy.
I hope the bathroom's in the basement.
it's like a fun house.
it's Latin.
everything's so beautiful.
family, just so we're all clear, Miss Maggie does not do windows.
Wow!
what an incredible wealth of knowledge.
a samurai sword.
in your dreams, pal.
dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.
Oh, Cyrus.
you crazy son of a bitch, what did you do?
goodness.
it's like a cathedral.
all right, first rule: No throwing stones.
it's marvelous, though, isn't it?
a living work of art.
the sooner you show me where you hid the basement...
...the sooner I can get my ass out of here.
I believe it's down the hall. It's two doors on the right.
excuse me.
the construction is amazing.
I'm getting dizzy.
Bobby.
don't touch anything. Okay?
at least until we get property insurance.
Arthur, we've got some papers to sign in the library.
after that, I'd love to give you and your family a tour of the house.
great. I don't want you guys to move from this spot.
we'll be right back.
you're being paranoid and overprotective.
Yeah, of all this stuff.
I know you guys too well. Stay right here. I mean it.
what the...?
Where'd you hide your money, old man?
shit!
what the hell was that?
Oh, no.
Oh, Cyrus.
now I know I'm dreaming.
was Cyrus a hunter?
you could say that.
your uncle was quite a collector of many things.
I've marked where you're supposed to sign, Arthur.
okay, look.
I didn't want to bring this up in front of the kids...
...but this place is beyond amazing.
I'm just a math teacher.
the taxes alone must be...
I have nothing set aside.
to be honest, a fire took away everything.
Arthur, you don't need to worry.
Cyrus was a genius when it came to finances.
basically, you and your family never have to worry about money again.
son of a bitch.
lookee here. Look, y'all.
look, look!
sign.
Arthur?
Arthur, we've got to...
we have to talk.
what is the deal with the breakers?
nothing. I'm not a power guy. My name is Dennis Rafkin.
you're Dennis Rafkin? - Who's Dennis Rafkin?
my office warned me about this guy.
I know this will sound completely whacked, but stay with me.
I used to hunt displaced spiritual energies with your uncle.
I'm sorry?
pk agents. Revenants. Wraiths.
do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
okay. I'll do this the easy way: ghosts.
Arthur, I used to...
I used to hunt ghosts with your Uncle Cyrus.
goats?
ghosts! Ghosts, goddamn it! Listen to me!
race you to the end of the hall.
no, Bobby, I don't think this is the place
come on, slowpoke! Is that the best you got?
my grandma scoots better than that.
ghosts. As in disgruntled spirits trapped on earth. Ghosts.
as in Halloween? Boo?
as in Demi Moore and Unchained Melody. Ghosts.
ghosts. Okay, I get it. I'm scared.
don't laugh at me. Don't laugh.
I'll explain everything...
...as soon as you get you and your children outside.
what's taking you so long? - Out of my way.
I don't think scooting is your game. -Come on.
I won. -You cheated. I didn't get a start.
got to be on your toes, man.
this has to be my room. There are toys everywhere.
I wonder what my room's like. - This is the coolest room in the house.
I'll be in here.
this place is awesome!
Cyrus has containment cubes all over the basement.
I don't know why they're here...
...and I am not staying around to find out.
so, if I were you-- -Well, he isn't you.
this guy has been harassing my office since your uncle died.
I see this all the time.
some rich guy passes away and all the nuts come out!
next thing, he'll be claiming Cyrus owned him money or
he did owe me money. He owed me a shitload of money!
these are some funky-looking specs.
what do you think? Do I look cool? - Let me see.
not so fast. Cater to my ego first:
Maggie's the best babysitter you ever had.
come on! -All right.
I'm getting my ass out of the big glass house!
grab your children! Do the same.
are you all right?
Jean! Jean!
we'll go get you some help. Okay?
don't touch me.
Oh, my God!
we have struck gold.
easy. -Don't.
how's your head?
not good.
Where's the suit?
power guy. Idiot.
cool!
better have a pair of those in my room.
Bobby, where are you going?
what are you staring at?
Hey, kiddo.
he thinks I'm going to duck.
nice tits.
what's the matter, honey? Bad representation?
not bad for an hourly wage.
it's time to leave.
I'll take your word for it.
Kathy?
come on. This way.
shit! What the hell? Kathy!
Maggie? Bobby!
I was just kidding before.
a little lawyer humor.
Kathy?
Bobby!
I don't believe it.
believe what?
I told them not to leave this spot. -They're kids, what do you expect?
thank you, Dr.Phil. You check downstairs. I'll look up.
Bobby, come on! It's time to go!
Kathy? Where are you guys?
Bobby!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
what are you doing up here? I told you to wait downstairs.
dad, come on. This bathroom is unbelievable.
great house. Beautiful bathroom. Now, where is your brother?
he's with Maggie.
was with Maggie. We were racing and we saw all the glass
you're supposed to watch him. That's what I pay you for.
Bobby.
down here.
Maggie?
come on down and play.
is that you?
Maggie?
stop playing games.
Bobby? I have something for you. We'll have lots of fun.
don't come down, Bobby.
stay upstairs.
don't follow her.
down here, Bobby.
Bobby, don't come down.
Bobby, around the corner.
don't come down here!
that's it.
you guys, I'm gonna tell Dad!
Bobby!
I'll find Bobby. But I want you both out of here.
but, Dad--- No "buts"!
I want you both to wait in the car. I'll be out as soon as I find the kid.
why are you freaking out? -Just this once, don't argue with me.
what happened to the door?
son of a bitch!
I cannot believe this.
I'm going to have to break it down. Back away!
it's quite dramatic...
...but you're wasting your time. It's all sealed up.
weren't you in an orange jumpsuit? -Don't go there.
what do you mean, "all sealed up"?
what part of that code are you having trouble cracking?
the entire house is sealed up.
there must be another way out. - I've looked.
we'll look again, right after I find my son. Now get up.
I don't know what is going on here, or who the hell you are.
and my son is missing.
so, until those questions are answered, you're not leaving my sight.
now, get up!
all right. Breathe.
did the lawyer split?
Bobby.
Bobby.
come on, guys! Stop hiding!
Bobby!
Bobby. -Come on out now, pal!
stop screwing around.
glass family Robinson, you're wasting your breath.
this is ectobar glass. He won't hear you.
this is shatterproof and soundproof.
what are these?
that's a little harder to explain. They're containment spells.
ghosts can't cross those.
ghosts? -Yes, ghosts.
the supernatural realm has its own laws. For ghosts, it's spells.
written or spoken, the ghosts have to obey whatever the spells say.
the entire basement is filled with ghosts.
in this basement?
of course, in this basement. If it was next door, I wouldn't give a shit!
dad!
I can prove it. - I gave a pair of those to Bobby.
spectral viewers. You can see ghosts with these.
Bobby, come on.
I don't see any ghosts. -Because they're locked downstairs.
dad!
there's more of this crazy spell shit on the floor.
let me see those.
Bobby! Come on out, pal!
hidden barrier spells. Why would he need more protection?
all right, that's enough. This is not helping.
do me a favor and stop with all the haunted house nonsense...
...at least until we find the kid and figure a way out of here.
Bobby, come on.
I don't know where he could be.
no, no!
wait!
what did I just say, that there was a petting zoo downstairs?
No!
there are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.
right, right. But you also said...
...that they're all locked up. Right?
no. No way. -Wait.
listen.
I'll make a deal with you.
I'll pay you whatever Cyrus owed you...
...if you just help me...
...find my son.
unbelievable. Get out of my way.
Bobby.
get out of the basement. You need to go upstairs.
you need to put on those glasses.
leave me alone!
that's it. That's a good boy.
Bobby.
Bobby.
go upstairs and find your father.
mom?
go on.
go upstairs!
go find Kathy.
watch out.
watch out.
Bobby! Come on!
you don't have to scream, all right? Just...
...chill.
this way. -Hold on. Listen to me.
this will take forever. This place is just too big.
Kathy and I will head up this way. You two check down there.
no, I don't think we should split up. -It's okay.
go in a straight line, turn around. We'll meet back here in five.
five. Back here.
don't touch anything.
I don't want to go with him! -Go ahead.
let's go back to the ghost thingy.
there are ghosts down here. If you don't believe me, look for yourself.
I told you, I can't see any ghosts.
what the hell? Give me those. Let me see. Why are these open?
I was down here before. They weren't open.
God! I hate it when they do that! -Do what?
they wait for you to put your face up to the glass, then give you...
...a big, fat "boo"!
don't do that!
God.
see it?
it's, it's... - A ghost.
just like I've been saying all night! Finally, a believer!
ghosts are around us all the time. Most of them can't hurt us.
most don't want to. Ghosts here, ghosts there, no one cares.
but there are exceptions, like this bad-ass behind me.
those who die violently stay in a tortured realm, so that's all they know.
what is he doing?
I don't know. I can't see. I don't have the glasses.
I've had it with this. It's time to go.
now! Please! -Don't touch me.
will you come on?
come on, ghost boy! Move your ass! It's time to go.
dad, slow down. We're going to get lost.
dad!
dad.
listen to me.
he's going to be okay.
we're going to find him.
I am so ready to leave this place.
Oh, boy. -What?
that's the symbol of The Jackal. - What's The Jackal?
the Jackal is the Charlie Manson of ghosts. If he's out, screw the kid.
we've got to get out of this basement.
maybe Rafkin was right, and maybe there
Kathy!
think about what you're saying.
there is no such thing as ghosts.
Kathy.
Kathy!
what is it? I can't see it! Tell me where it is!
get off!
hold on! Stay with me!
come on, pull!
who are you? -Never mind, just pull.
shit! Don't speak. Don't move.
somehow...
...we got behind enemy lines.
Hurry!
please, hurry!
Hey, little guy.
how. -Don't tease the ghosts.
will you shut up? -You shut up. You keep pissing them off.
go.
Maggie! -What?
where? I can't see without the glasses, idiot!
well, I can see. And I think you should go this way!
go, go!
it's all right. I've got you.
look at me.
daddy.
it's okay.
who the hell are you?
and what the hell was that?
my name is Kallna Oretzia. I'm in the spirit reclamation business.
what?
I free trapped souls. Cyrus
forget Cyrus, who traps souls, for a damn second.
what are you doing here?
looks to me like I'm saving your ass.
Oh, my God! It's over there! It's over there!
give him your glasses.
come on!
Oh, my God.
unbelievable.
another one of Cyrus's victims.
I hope to God the barrier spells hold.
victims?
Cyrus had a nasty habit of enslaving souls.
that's why I'm here. I intend to set them all free.
listen to me.
I need to know...
...how you got in here.
I slipped through an opening in the house when it shifted.
an opening where? - It's closed now. It won't happen again.
let me show you. This is the Arcanum.
many people died in the quest for this book.
it was written in the 15th century by an astrologer named Basileus.
in it, he describes the making of a certain machine.
one that can see into the future.
he wrote it while he was under demonic possession.
I can't believe Cyrus built it.
built what? What are you talking about?
Basileus's device.
we're in the middle of a machine, designed by the devil and powered by the dead.
listen to me.
I don't give a shit about any machine...
...or devil or Basileus or anything...
...except getting my family the hell out of this place.
I came here to set the souls in this house free.
you want help, you have to help me first.
Kathy, can you walk?
Kathy! Oh, no. This can't be happening!
we have to get out of here. - I'm not going anywhere without my kids.
try telling him that.
come on.
this way. Come on.
stairs. Let's go.
go. You go!
don't touch me!
wait! The glasses!
you'll need these! Catch!
good job. -Sorry.
perfect. Another dead end.
okay, genius, we found the stairs. How do we get to them?
get away. -What? What do we do now?
get away from the glass.
Why? -Just do it.
glasses.
duck!
move! Go left!
do something, for Christ's sake! We're running out of corridors!
duck! Go Ieft! Go right! Move!
get down!
here. We've got to get to the library. It has spell protection all around it.
where is that from here?
can I rely on you not to get me killed?
I guarantee nothing.
see anything?
anything? - No.
come on.
I think they're just downstairs.
nothing.
if we get out of this alive, I've got to get a pay raise.
that's a big "if.
give me the flare.
what's wrong? Don't start freaking out now. Come on.
what?
okay. What? - Shut up.
give me the book.
just back up.
go. Slow.
okay, I'm going slow. - Slow.
go! Go!
fast!
what the hell? -Who the hell?
what the hell are you doing here?
shit!
remember me?
thanks for taking your time.
go down the hall. Turn left, then right.
where are we going? -Trust me, okay?
Arthur? -Trust her.
okay, let's go!
what happened to Kathy?
I don't know, she disappeared.
how do you lose an entire family in a glass house?
Arthur!
Kallna, give me a flare!
get him! Go! Get up!
this is not the time to be a girl! Run!
stop dragging your ass, man! Go!
Oh, my God! Go! Run!
now is not the time to sit around, Arthur! Run!
get the door. Close the door!
Arthur, are you all right?
God, what's going on here? Fucking ghosts.
I hate this job.
they don't like you, either. I wonder why.
you got something to say, say it.
all right. Let's start with: This is all your goddamn fault!
if you hadn't caught them, we wouldn't be running from them.
it was his uncle that built the house!
you helped him. How could you help him without knowing what he was doing?
I had my reasons. -Money, you parasite.
you stole people's souls for money! How depraved is that?
if you haven't noticed, I'm a bit of a freak!
I come within 10 feet of anything dead, I go into seizures.
I touch somebody, a whole life full of shit flashes in front of my eyes.
so, yeah, I'm depraved.
but Cyrus was my friend, and he accepted me.
he didn't accept you. You're so pathetic!
he used you. -Shut up, both of you.
cut him some slack. What difference does it make?
you didn't tell him, did you?
tell me what? What now?
about the fourth ghost.
don't do this. I didn't tell him.
he has a right to know.
what about the fourth ghost?
St. Luke's Hospital. Six months ago.
you're saying my wife's spirit...
...is trapped in this house?
I didn't know you.
I didn't know her. I didn't know she had a husband.
Why? In God's name, why? Tell me, why her?
I don't know. Cyrus handpicked them, including your wife.
I figured out who you were and I've been trying to help you.
you call this help? She's right! This is all your goddamn fault!
son of a bitch!
you can save her. And your kids, too.
just listen to me and believe me.
this house is not a house.
it is a machine.
a complete and faithful re-creation of Basileus's design.
according to this, there should be 12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.
see these? They represent the black zodiac.
they represent the ghosts that Cyrus needed to catch: The First-Born Son.
I don't want to play.
the Torso.
the Bound Woman.
the Withered Lover.
Jean.
Bobby. I love you.
the Torn Prince.
the Angry Princess.
I'm sorry.
the Pilgrimess.
the Great Child and the Dire Mother.
the Hammer.
and here, the sign of Hell's Winter: The Jackal.
and The Juggernaut.
according to Basileus, the machine required the energy...
...of these specific spirits in order to bring it to life.
once it engages, the spirits are released one by one.
the house then draws them to its center.
each one adds its energy to the machine, powering it up.
powering it up for what?
to open the Ocularis Infernum.
what's that?
it's Latin.
Ocularis Infernum. The Eye of Hell?
very good.
the Eye of Hell. I'm stuck in a glass house with crazy white people...
go on.
in hell, there is an eye that sees everything, the past, the future...
...heaven and earth, the blessed, the damned.
if knowledge is power, then the man who controls the Ocularis...
...would be the most powerful man on earth.
your uncle.
great.
so...
...how many ghosts have been set free?
eleven. And the house needs twelve.
no. Damon said something about thirteen.
that there are thirteen ghosts.
the thirteenth ghost is a fall-safe.
to stop the process, the house needs a sacrifice of life instead of death.
a willing, human sacrifice.
a sacrifice of the broken heart.
the only ghost to be created out of an act of pure love.
you're the thirteenth ghost.
the thirteenth spirit stands before the eye at the final configuration.
as the eye opens, the spirit uses the power of life...
...to short-circuit the system.
uses the power of life how?
by leaping into the eye.
and Arthur's supposed to take this leap? No fucking way, lady.
that's suicide. I won't let you do it.
you need to come up with something else. That's not working.
love is the most powerful energy.
Meaning?
in order for you to save your children, you must trade your life for theirs.
let me see this.
there's got to be a better way.
I don't read Latin.
well, we can try it the old-fashioned way, my personal favorite.
nobody will be here to brag about it afterwards.
we need to come up with a game plan soon. Time's running out.
are you going to blow the place up?
the last ghost is about to be released.
I know why you feel you have to do this. -Get away from me.
psychics call it a "linking." We linked earlier. I saw everything...
...about Jean, about you.
shut up. I'm not going to listen to this from you.
Kallna is talking about suicide.
anything to save my kids.
it doesn't add up. It doesn't make any sense.
there's got to be a better way.
doesn't add up"? What does add up here, Dennis?
how much of this equation makes any sense at all?
goddamn it. Goddamn it.
all I can think about are my kids.
I don't even know if they're alive.
then let's go out there and find out.
one last time, while there's still time, you and me.
Kallna...
...no matter what I decide to do, or what happens to any of us...
...are you sure you can you stop that machine?
I've got enough explosives to blow us back to the 15th century.
okay.
how many flares do you have left? -One, why?
we're going out again.
no fucking way, Arthur. You're going to get yourself killed.
not if we take that.
we got about ten minutes until the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan.
go.
we'll go down and buy you some time.
after you, Captain America.
damn. I just got my nails done.
here. Put these on.
come on, let's go!
there's no place like home.
there's no place like home. There's no place like home.
there's no place like home.
knock it off, Dennis. Just keep your eyes open.
I sure hope I don't bleed to death.
that would suck.
rotate.
is that half the lawyer?
here, take this. Move it.
Oh, my God. He definitely looked better.
Oh, my God. Shit.
girl, hurry up!
ram him! -He's swinging for the fences!
Kallna, get over here! This flare shit ain't working! Hurry up!
where is it?
where is it?
Kallna?
why are you so mad at me? I did everything you asked me to do.
I killed Damon, I stole his spells.
I made sure your pathetic nephew didn't get himself killed!
Kallna!
where are the spells?
you're not mad at me, are you?
of course not.
what is it? - Oh, shit.
there's only room for one of us.
what are you doing?
don't worry, I've been looking for a reason to like myself for a long time.
Dennis, don't do this!
Hey, bro. You ain't nothing but a bitch!
Dennis, no!
Oh, my God.
what do we do now?
your nephew believes that sacrificing himself will save his kids.
but he won't do it unless his kids are in jeopardy.
well, put them in jeopardy. -What?
why not? -But they're kids.
greatness requires sacrifice.
now, I have a job to do.
and so have you.
do it. Do it!
Yes.
and now to finish this.
Oh, my God. Jean.
I loved you so much.
I miss you.
miss you.
I'm nothing without you.
don't go.
don't go.
fetch the book.
Cyrus! What are you doing?
you just can't teach some people.
I thought I told you, greatness requires sacrifice.
Kathy! -Bobby, don't look.
I don't want to look.
Kathy, I'm scared!
Kathy!
Kathy! Bobby!
daddy!
Bobby!
dad, help!
Oh, my...
make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!
this house is not a house. It's a machine...
...designed by the devil...
...and powered by the dead.
according to Basileus, there should be 12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.
they represent the black zodiac.
they represent the ghosts that Cyrus needed to catch:
the First-Born Son. -One.
the Torso. -Two.
the Bound Woman. -Three.
the Withered Lover. -Four.
the Torn Prince.
the Angry Princess. The Pilgrimess.
the Great Child and the Dire Mother.
the Hammer. The Jackal. And The Juggernaut.
twelve.
you're the thirteenth ghost.
if I'm the thirteenth...
you son of a bitch!
release my kids, you bastard!
damn you! You're nothing, Arthur!
do you hear? You loser!
I've dedicated my entire life to this.
every waking moment, for years.
have you ever shown that kind of dedication? Have you?
the world has no time for little people like you.
it needs people who are willing to do anything!
anything for greatness.
you don't have a choice this time, Arthur.
you will make that leap.
the machine requires a ghost to be created out of an act of pure love.
that's why I chose you, nephew. You and your pathetic family.
make it stop, Dad!
congratulations, you get to become the thirteenth ghost.
get on your feet.
come on!
trust me, Arthur. It's not over yet.
you can finish this.
you still have the power in you.
it's just a matter of how you use it. Go to your kids. They need you.
dad! Help!
daddy, don't! Don't do it!
Oh, fuck!
dad!
don't move!
keep your heads down!
hold on!
everybody okay?
you okay?
how did you know we'd be safe here?
I didn't.
I just wasn't about to leave you guys.
I love you both so much.
mom?
I love you guys.
I love you.
this is it for me.
I am on the first plane back to Newark.
I am sorry, family, Kathy, Bobby, Uncle, ghosts...
...I am sick of this nanny shit.
I've had it. This was not in the job description. I quit!
what are you doing up here? I told you to wait downstairs.
dad, come on. This bathroom is unbelievable.
great house. Beautiful bathroom. Now, where is your brother?
he's with Maggie.
was with Maggie. We were racing and we saw all the glass
you're supposed to watch him. That's what I pay you for.
Bobby.
down here.
Maggie?
come on down and play.
is that you?
Maggie?
stop playing games.
Bobby? I have something for you. We'll have lots of fun.
don't come down, Bobby.
stay upstairs.
don't follow her.
down here, Bobby.
Bobby, don't come down.
Bobby, Around the corner.
don't come down here!
that's it.
you guys, I'm gonna tell Dad!
Bobby!
I'll find Bobby. But I want you both out of here.
but, Dad-- -No "buts"!
I want you both to wait in the car. I'll be out as soon as I find the kid.
why are you freaking out? -Just this once, don't argue with me.
what happened to the door?
son of a bitch!
I cannot believe this.
I'm going to have to break it down. Back away!
it's quite dramatic...
...but you're wasting your time. It's all sealed up.
weren't you in an orange jumpsuit? -Don't go there.
what do you mean, "all sealed up"?
what part of that code are you having trouble cracking?
the entire house is sealed up.
there must be another way out. -I've looked.
we'll look again, right after I find my son. Now get up.
I don't know what is going on here, or who the hell you are.
and my son is missing.
so, until those questions are answered, you're not leaving my sight.
now, get up!
all right. Breathe.
did the lawyer split?
Bobby.
Bobby.
come on, guys! Stop hiding!
Bobby!
Bobby. -Come on out now, pal!
stop screwing around.
glass family Robinson, you're wasting your breath.
this is ectobar glass. He won't hear you.
this is shatterproof and soundproof.
what are these?
that's a little harder to explain. They're containment spells.
ghosts can't cross those.
ghosts? -Yes, ghosts.
the supernatural realm has its own laws. For ghosts, it's spells.
written or spoken, the ghosts have to obey whatever the spells say.
the entire basement is filled with ghosts.
in this basement?
of course, in this basement. If it was next door, I wouldn't give a shit!
dad!
I can prove it. -I gave a pair of those to Bobby.
spectral viewers. You can see ghosts with these.
Bobby, come on.
I don't see any ghosts. -Because they're locked downstairs.
dad!
there's more of this crazy spell shit on the floor.
let me see those.
Bobby! Come on out, pal!
hidden barrier spells. Why would he need more protection?
all right, that's enough. This is not helping.
do me a favor and stop with all the haunted house nonsense...
...at least until we find the kid and figure a way out of here.
Bobby, come on.
I don't know where he could be.
no, no!
wait!
what did I just say, that there was a petting zoo downstairs?
No!
there are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.
right, right. But you also said...
...that they're all locked up. Right?
no. No way. -Wait.
listen.
I'll make a deal with you.
I'll pay you whatever Cyrus owed you...
...if you just help me...
...find my son.
unbelievable. Get out of my way.
Bobby.
get out of the basement. You need to go upstairs.
you need to put on those glasses.
leave me alone!
that's it. That's a good boy.
Bobby.
Bobby.
go upstairs and find your father.
mom?
go on.
go upstairs!
go find Kathy.
watch out.
watch out.
Bobby! Come on!
you don't have to scream, all right? Just...
...chill.
this way. -Hold on. Listen to me.
this will take forever. This place is just too big.
Kathy and I will head up this way. You two check down there.
no, I don't think we should split up. -It's okay.
go in a straight line, turn around. We'll meet back here in five.
five. Back here.
don't touch anything.
I don't want to go with him! -Go ahead.
let's go back to the ghost thingy.
there are ghosts down here. If you don't believe me, look for yourself.
I told you, I can't see any ghosts.
what the hell? Give me those. Let me see. Why are these open?
I was down here before. They weren't open.
God! I hate it when they do that! -Do what?
they wait for you to put your face up to the glass, then give you...
...a big, fat "boo"!
don't do that!
God.
see it?
it's, it's... -A ghost.
just Like I've been saying all night! Finally, a believer!
ghosts are around us all the time. Most of them can't hurt us.
most don't want to. Ghosts here, ghosts there, no one cares.
but there are exceptions, Like this bad-ass behind me.
those who die violently stay in a tortured realm, so that's all they know.
what is he doing?
I don't know. I can't see. I don't have the glasses.
I've had it with this. It's time to go.
now! Please! -Don't touch me.
will you come on?
come on, ghost boy! Move your ass! It's time to go.
dad, slow down. We're going to get lost.
dad!
dad.
listen to me.
he's going to be okay.
we're going to find him.
I am so ready to leave this place.
Oh, boy. -What?
that's the symbol of The Jackal. -What's The Jackal?
the Jackal is the Charlie Manson of ghosts. If he's out, screw the kid.
we've got to get out of this basement.
maybe Rafkin was right, and maybe there

Ocularis Infernum. The Eye of Hell?
very good.
the Eye of Hell. I'm stuck in a glass house with crazy white people...
go on.
in hell, there is an eye that sees everything, the past, the future...
...heaven and earth, the blessed, the damned.
if knowledge is power, then the man who controls the Ocularis...
...would be the most powerful man on earth.
your uncle.
great.
so...
...how many ghosts have been set free?
eleven. And the house needs twelve.
no. Damon said something about thirteen.
that there are thirteen ghosts.
the thirteenth ghost is a fall-safe.
to stop the process, the house needs a sacrifice of life instead of death.
a willing, human sacrifice.
a sacrifice of the broken heart.
the only ghost to be created out of an act of pure love.
you're the thirteenth ghost.
the thirteenth spirit stands before the eye at the final configuration.
as the eye opens, the spirit uses the power of life...
...to short-circuit the system.
uses the power of Life how?
by leaping into the eye.
and Arthur's supposed to take this leap? No fucking way, lady.
that's suicide. I won't let you do it.
you need to come up with something else. That's not working.
love is the most powerful energy.
Meaning?
in order for you to save your children, you must trade your Life for theirs.
let me see this.
there's got to be a better way.
I don't read Latin.
well, we can try it the old-fashioned way, my personal favorite.
nobody will be here to brag about it afterwards.
we need to come up with a game plan soon. Time's running out.
are you going to blow the place up?
the last ghost is about to be released.
I know why you feel you have to do this. -Get away from me.
psychics call it a "linking." We linked earlier. I saw everything...
...about Jean, about you.
shut up. I'm not going to listen to this from you.
Kallna is talking about suicide.
anything to save my kids.
it doesn't add up. It doesn't make any sense.
there's got to be a better way.
doesn't add up"? What does add up here, Dennis?
how much of this equation makes any sense at all?
goddamn it. Goddamn it.
all I can think about are my kids.
I don't even know if they're alive.
then let's go out there and find out.
one last time, while there's still time, you and me.
Kallna...
...no matter what I decide to do, or what happens to any of us...
...are you sure you can you stop that machine?
I've got enough explosives to blow us back to the 15th century.
okay.
how many flares do you have left? -One, why?
we're going out again.
no fucking way, Arthur. You're going to get yourself killed.
not if we take that.
we got about ten minutes until the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan.
go.
we'll go down and buy you some time.
after you, Captain America.
damn. I just got my nails done.
here. Put these on.
come on, let's go!
there's no place Like home.
there's no place Like home. There's no place Like home.
there's no place Like home.
knock it off, Dennis. Just keep your eyes open.
I sure hope I don't bleed to death.
that would suck.
rotate.
is that half the lawyer?
here, take this. Move it.
Oh, my God. He definitely looked better.
Oh, my God. Shit.
girl, hurry up!
ram him! -He's swinging for the fences!
Kallna, get over here! This flare shit ain't working! Hurry up!
where is it?
where is it?
Kallna?
why are you so mad at me? I did everything you asked me to do.
I killed Damon, I stole his spells.
I made sure your pathetic nephew didn't get himself killed!
Kallna!
where are the spells?
you're not mad at me, are you?
of course not.
what is it? -Oh, shit.
there's only room for one of us.
what are you doing?
don't worry, I've been looking for a reason to Like myself for a long time.
Dennis, don't do this!
Hey, bro. You ain't nothing but a bitch!
Dennis, no!
Oh, my God.
what do we do now?
your nephew believes that sacrificing himself will save his kids.
but he won't do it unless his kids are in jeopardy.
well, put them in jeopardy. -What?
why not? -But they're kids.
greatness requires sacrifice.
now, I have a job to do.
and so have you.
do it. Do it!
Yes.
and now to finish this.
Oh, my God. Jean.
I loved you so much.
I miss you.
miss you.
I'm nothing without you.
don't go.
don't go.
fetch the book.
Cyrus! What are you doing?
you just can't teach some people.
I thought I told you, greatness requires sacrifice.
Kathy! -Bobby, don't look.
I don't want to look.
Kathy, I'm scared!
Kathy!
Kathy! Bobby!
daddy!
Bobby!
dad, help!
Oh, my...
make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!
this house is not a house. It's a machine...
...designed by the devil...
...and powered by the dead.
according to Basileus, there should be 12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.
they represent the black zodiac.
they represent the ghosts that Cyrus needed to catch:
the First-Born Son. -One.
the Torso. -Two.
the Bound Woman. -Three.
the Withered Lover. -Four.
the Torn Prince.
the Angry Princess. The Pilgrimess.
the Great Child and the Dire Mother.
the Hammer. The Jackal. And The Juggernaut.
twelve.
you're the thirteenth ghost.
if I'm the thirteenth...
you son of a bitch!
release my kids, you bastard!
damn you! You're nothing, Arthur!
do you hear? You loser!
I've dedicated my entire Life to this.
every waking moment, for years.
have you ever shown that kind of dedication? Have you?
the world has no time for little people Like you.
it needs people who are willing to do anything!
anything for greatness.
you don't have a choice this time, Arthur.
you will make that leap.
the machine requires a ghost to be created...
...out of an act of pure love.
that's why I chose you, nephew. You and your pathetic family.
make it stop, Dad!
congratulations, you get to become the thirteenth ghost.
get on your feet.
come on!
trust me, Arthur. It's not over yet.
you can finish this.
you still have the power in you.
it's just a matter of how you use it. Go to your kids. They need you.
dad! Help!
daddy, don't! Don't do it!
Oh, fuck!
dad!
don't move!
keep your heads down!
hold on!
everybody okay?
you okay?
how did you know we'd be safe here?
I didn't.
I just wasn't about to leave you guys.
I love you both so much.
mom?
I love you guys.
I love you.
this is it for me.
I am on the first plane back to Newark.
I am sorry, family, Kathy, Bobby, Uncle, ghosts...
...I am sick of this nanny shit.
I've had it. This was not in the job description. I quit!
are we clear?
Yeah. Let's go.
bogota, COLUMBIA 2005
let's move.
Hey!
here, take the case.
Mr. Anderson.
??? No need to shoot, okay?
you got it, sweetheart?
Yeah.
Yeah, I got it.
well... give it to him.
nice shot, Mrs. Anderson.
why, thank you, Mr. Anderson.
Hi.
um... - Hello, Chuck.
miss me?
Hey. That was a fast date.
is everything okay with you and Sarah?
everything, except her ex is in town.
stalker ex. Not awesome.
does he know that you and Sarah are dating?
Yeah. I just think he's taking the whole "we can still be friend" thing to heart.
don't sweat it, Chuck.
this guy can't hold a candle to you.
and what does he have that's so great?
uh, that would be good looks, sophistication, an exciting career, and much more history with Sarah.
you know what?
I'm sure that Sarah will take care of it.
this guy will be out of your life in no time.
something tells me, it won't be quite that simple.
do you want to talk?
watch something else?
no. No, I'm good.
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna hang.
I'm fine. I'm gonna be fine.
so, I'm just gonna sit here alone, not technically, but, you know, emotionally.
okay, look at this.
this is what I'm talking about.
I'm worried about Lester as the new assistant manager.
why, is he making you work?
please, Chuck, I have mad-work avoidance skills.
true... true.
no, he's drunk with power, man.
I once read that Mussolini started in retail.
Really? Hmm. - Mm-hmm.
it could be worse.
it could be Casey.
lunch break: Orange Orange.
yogurt again? Can't we have a meatball sub?
we're not eating, idiot. We got a new mission.
does it have anything to do with Bryce
why he's in town? - I don't know.
if I know Larkin, he's probably here for a roll in the hay with Walker.
get down!
kick it, baby!
look at them.
visiting from their Mighty Jocks sporting goods store with their cola and tacos.
they can't treat my store like a frat house.
come here. Come here.
get in there and kick those ruffians out.
that's Mitt and his merry band of maniacs.
not only are the giants, they are psychopaths.
look, I'm sorry, Morgan.
management means making tough decisions.
now go in there and kick them out!
I got it! I got him!
he's got him.
you guys having a good time?
good, good. Sorry... Can I get a second, please?
one second, man. I'm in the middle of a play.
right. Well, um...
okay. Well, obviously, you haven't heard.
heard what?
we have some new rules here at the Buy More.
basically, uh, we just, uh-uh...are requiring customers to clean up after themselves and allowing others to enjoy the various video game consoles
specifically, the Madden football, you know.
and-and if it's possible, if we could all just, kind of, as group here
myself included, okay?
use our indoor voices, - as my mother used to say. - We're so sorry.
we didn't mean to offend anybody.
we didn't know you had new rules.
I'm going to clean up my lunch.
thank you so much, man. I was nervous about asking you.
Oh, you're just gonna...?
there you go, buddy. We're all cleaned up.
and, dude... if you ever interrupt another one of my games, gonna be your face that gets smushed.
you understand that?
Per-perfect.
all right, buddy. Thanks.
any idea what Bryce is doing in town?
he's not staying with you, is he?
not now, Chuck.
is there something you would like to share with the rest of the class, Mr. Bartowski?
no, sorry, General.
zipping it up.
the Fulcrum threat is far worse than it originally appeared.
we've learned one of their agents stole an encrypted microchip containing top secret information out of the DNI.
the information on the chip contained highly classified intelligence- a refresh for the new Intersect.
is there anything on that chip that could compromise our cover?
unfortunately, yes.
agent Larkin has learned that Fulcrum hired Von Hayes, a wealthy software magnet, to decrypt the chip and deliver the encoded information back to them.
Mr. Hayes is throwing a lavish party at his Bel Air estate this evening.
the finest dining, music and food.
your job will be to pose as a married couple and steal back the chip.
see? This is what I'm talking about, General.
finally a mission I can sink my teeth into.
dust off the tux, polish up the dancing shoes...
no, Chuck.
this mission is going to require a real spy.
sorry I'm late.
l. A. traffic's still the worst.
Bryce will be posing as Sarah's husband.
Chuck, you'll be posing as a waiter.
try and flash on and identify the Fulcrum agent.
well, Mrs. Anderson.
Hey, Casey. Um, so what's the deal with the... with the mission tonight?
Sarah said you were working on the plan?
Yeah, yeah, we're making it airtight so even you can't screw it up.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
so what's the scoop with the...you know, the Andersons?
why, you worried Bryce is going to steal your girl?
okay, you know what? First of all,
Sarah and I are purely professional, so I resent any accusation otherwise.
and second of all, I can't take an interest in my coworker's mission?
I mean, I figure if I'm going to be stuck being a spy for a while now, I think, you know,
I want to learn a little lesson from...the master.
all right, the microchip is stored inside a vault in Von Hayes' mansion.
all Bryce and Sarah need to do, is slip out of the main ballroom and grab it.
well, aren't people going to be asking questions if they see them snooping around the house?
Bryce and Sarah will be very affectionate.
that way, no one will ask them any questions when they're looking for the vault.
that's the beauty of PDA.
the company really knows how to put you into a cute outfit.
we're not undercover yet, Bryce.
well, you can't be too careful.
you never know who's watching, Mrs. Anderson.
Yeah, uh... about the Andersons,
I really think that we should keep it strictly a cover this time.
okay. Everything all right?
Yeah, it's just with Fulcrum getting closer and closer, we should be... focused.
you know, no distractions.
you're right. Yeah... no distractions.
I have to admit, though, it sure was fun while it lasted.
I've always found that lunch travels better in a bag, but maybe that's just me.
Yeah. Well... Lester made me kick the Mighty Jocks out of the home theater so Mitt burritoed me.
buddy, what have I told you about direct confrontation with the Mighty Jocks- Mitt specifically?
run with my tail between my legs and go get John Casey.
I know.
man, you ever have someone show up in your life and just make you feel so damn small?
Yeah, that...
buddy, there's always going to be someone that's cooler or better-looking or more athletic than us.
but there's one thing we have that they don't.
I got a beard.
brains. Brains! And if we use our brains, then we're going to be okay.
you're right, dude, I know.
all right, good talk.
uh...
there you go.
Shmutz.
Hey. - Hey. Hey, I was just on my way home.
I got this thing to do with Sarah.
what's, what's going on?
uh, well, I went by the Orange Orange to ask Sarah to be a bridesmaid...
that is so sweet, Ellie.
Yeah. Um... Chuck, when I got there, I saw her holding hands with another guy.
I think it might be her ex.
Really? Uh, did you, did you get a good look at him?
well, I couldn't, 'cause he was faced the other way, but, uh, dark hair, sort of classically handsome...
I don't know if I'd...
I'd call him classically handsome.
maybe from like a weird angle or from really far away, maybe that...
they were holding hands, huh?
Yeah. I'm really sorry, Chuck.
don't be...
don't be, Elle, why? Why be sorry?
no, it's all good.
she was probably just letting him down easy.
trust me, things have never been better between us.
kick his butt!
Grimes, I thought I told you - to toss those meatheads. - I tried, dude.
what do you want me to do? Maybe they'll respond to somebody who's in a position of authority.
slovenly buffoons!
okay, all right, listen to me.
what about a plan that doesn't require...direct confrontation?
talk to me.
Pippin, he's Pippin. Last play of the game! This is the last play!
come on, you better do this.
Oh, oh, what a pass!
I'm takin' it to the house!
ten seconds. Nine...
Yes! - eight...
seven...
six...
five...
four...
three...
two...
what the hell?
that was a game-winning drive!
a game-winning drive!
and now what does it look like?
you know, kind of hard to tell a little bit by the glare.
super Bowl-winning drive! Franchise mode!
All-Madden!
I can tell you're upset.
you could have asked us to leave nicely.
I didn't even want to kick you guys out.
I'm just an employee.
my boss made me do it.
who's your boss?
Oh, come on... - Who?
the guy over there, real skinny.
after work...gonna kick both your asses.
thank you.
have a nice night.
you, too.
what, no rose for me this time, lover boy?
cute.
we're just protecting our cover.
sales up at the Buy More?
Yeah, as a matter of fact.
buy More, Buy More is good. We just got a new MacBook SMC firmware update.
so, you know, things are a little nutty. Mmm.
I can imagine.
that's...
so, uh, staying with Sarah, huh?
protecting our cover.
how are things between you guys?
they're good.
good, good, good. Solid.
Why? Did she say something? - No.
it's just she's a beautiful girl pretending to be your girlfriend.
I was afraid you'd let the lines get blurred and fall for her.
what? Me, fall for Sarah?
please.
Hey, guys.
Hey.
so, how do I look?
good!
Yeah, yeah, real good.
red's not really my color, so...
I forgot...
or salmon or whatever that is.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
as you all know, today is yours truly's birthday.
thank you.
no, no, no, no.
um, I have a lot to be thankful for.
I'm rich, handsome, an extraordinarily gifted lover
but, most importantly, I know how to throw one hell of party; so let's get it on, people!
Cheers!
Hey, Bartowski,
von Hayes is at table eight. Grab a bottle of wine, see if you flash on him.
pardon me, excuse me.
any security behind you?
no.
you're still a great dancer.
you're a little rusty.
Yes, sir, of course.
fantastic.
will you just let me lead?
no.
Hey, quit screwing around, Bartowski.
and get close to Von Hayes.
Oh! - Whoa, hey!
what the hell are you doing? - Oh!
I'm so- I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.
no, no, stop! Stop!
stop! - Okay, you know,
I'll go- I'll get fresh bottle. I'm so sorry, sir. You do that.
good help is so hard to find these days.
Casey, I didn't flash on anything.
keep looking, get your head in the game.
the camera's on the east and west walls, cross for about two seconds.
Lambada!
the forbidden dance.
that's the blind spot.
get a room.
right?
Oh! Oh!
are you on drugs? That was - No!
a thousand dollar bottle of Lafite Rothschild.
I'm so very sorry, sir. - You're very sorry, sir?
were you dropped as a child from very great height?
I- I actually, I couldn't confirm or deny that.
sir, is everything all right?
Congratulations.
you have succeeded in hiring possibly the worst waiter in history!
you heard the man, Jorge.
you're fired.
I'll call security to take you out.
no, no, no, no, no!
no, I need this job! Please don't fire me.
have some compassion, some mercy! - Hello,
Mr. Hayes, do you have my microchip?
hello.
well, my bosses don't like to wait.
Perhaps...we could talk in private.
let's go!
Hey, no, wait, no, no.
well, just let me finish my shift.
shift's over.
time to meet your maker.
I'm too young, upwardly mobile, and handsome to die.
don't worry, Morgan,
I'll take care of Anna when you're gone.
I'd rather be drawn and quartered.
let's go, Morgan.
we can't go.
mitt is going to kill us, dude!
Hey, unhand me, now.
all right, let's get it together here. - What?
all right, I'm not scared of Mitt.
you are crazy, man. I am not going anywhere.
that's why I get the girl.
Dead...man walkin'.
Oh, you know what?
holy smokes, I just remembered!
big Mike wanted me to finish this inventory by tomorrow morning.
Morgan, you can't let a bully like Mitt push you around.
this isn't high school.
no, it's worse.
this is Buy More.
it's all right. It's all right.
moron.
Bryce and Sarah are at the vault; come back to the van.
no. I flashed on a FULCRUM agent but I didn't see her face.
wait, wait, wait- we need to know she looks like.
go back inside and get me a real I. D.
I'm locked out.
Yeah, well, since I'm not a complete idiot, like a certain someone, by which I mean you,
I tapped into the security system.
try it now.
pretty impressive, Casey.
just get in there and find the FULCRUM agent.
you got five minutes.
go!
is that Jorge?
you promised us the decrypted chip two weeks ago and instead you're throwing - a party. - Well, what's the point of being rich if you can't have a little fun?
you have decrypted the information on the chip?
Yes, yes, it's all finished.
the, um, question is where's my fee?
forget the 15 million.
Oh, my God!
I think I'll just take my chip.
it's in my vault.
um... I'll take you r...
I'll take you right there.
Oh, Casey, Casey.
the microchip is not in the vault.
it is on Von Hayes' keychain.
and I also got a really good look - at the FULCRUM agent. - What'd she look like?
Oh, my gosh, dude, so awful.
I mean incredibly creepy.
think... Think psycho elfin queen.
did you say FULCRUM?
Sarah! - Talk to me, Casey.
what's going on?
von Hayes is on the move.
where? - He's headed for the front.
he's got the chip.
Freeze! Federal agents.
Hey,
fulcrum agent has Chuck.
she's leaving out the back door.
Sarah, what are you doing? - Chuck's in danger.
that FULCRUM agent will kill him if we don't get...
no- our covers are on that microchip.
if we don't get it, all of us get killed.
Bartowski and the CIA- how could it not go wrong?
you gotta believe me! You gotta believe me!
the whole creepy elfin thing was a compliment, I swear!
ever since my 6th grade librarian introduced me to The Hobbit,
I been hooked on 'em. I don't know if it's the eyes - or the ears... - Shut up, Jorge!
Chuck, duck and cover!
go!
go!
you okay?
Chuck. Hey. - I'm, uh...
I... yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
run!
Oh, my...
Hi.
Hey.
I, uh, brought you some gardenias.
they're my favorite. How did you know?
well, I'm not an entirely incompetent spy, you know?
thank you.
and you can put them over there.
Bryce Larkin, huh?
I guess, no matter what it is,
I'll always come in second to that guy.
not always.
Ellie said you had a concussion?
Oh, it's just a minor concussion, I'm fine.
it's my ego that's hurt more than anything.
I don't believe it.
what's up, babe?
that is Sarah's ex.
that guy just won't back off.
you know what, Chuck might be too nice to say anything, but I am not.
whoa, whoa, hold on, babe.
let me handle this.
I'm sorry- it's my fault.
if I didn't get fired, this never would've happened.
Hey, don't apologize, okay?
it is not your job to protect me.
well...
all things being considered, that's probably a good thing.
Yeah, you have a lot of good qualities, but, uh, I'm not sure "bodyguard" is one of them.
Hey, bro!
Hey. - Whoa!
that cut looks infected.
Yeah, I better take a look at that- come on.
sorry, bro, but you got a lot of dirt in there.
Ow.
so...
how do you know Sarah?
she's my ex.
based on all the flowers you sent,
I'd say you still had feelings for her.
it's complicated.
I know.
she's dating my soon-to-be brother-in-law, Chuck.
I didn't know.
Sarah said she wanted to tell me something, but then she got hurt.
Ouch.
cut's pretty deep there.
so, um, Chuck and Sarah...
is it serious?
I'm specializing in cardiothoracic medicine.
that means there's one thing in the world I know best:
the human heart.
I've spent enough time with them to see how they are together, see how she looks at him.
my professional opinion?
she's in love with Chuck, dude.
you look terrible.
did you guys actually sleep at the Buy More last night, - so you could avoid Mitt? - What? No.
of course not. - Please, I'm not afraid of that miscreant.
and if he were here, we'd tell him.
Jeff, put that away.
no way! This is like Faces of Death all over again- I'm gonna make a fortune.
no, no. You want to do this?
let's do this.
let's do this. - Yes.
you guys didn't show up last night.
I felt like a girl that got stood up on prom night.
what's wrong? Don't you want to dance with me, bearded little man?
um...
Hey, do you think that maybe we could work this out together?
you know, man to man kind of thing?
we?
we.
all right, uh, you know, I... yes, I'll just have to take two weeks' advance pay, but yeah, fine.
okay, you got a deal.
that's right!
and don't ever come back!
wow, how'd you do that?
Yeah.
you... wow.
you really ought to think about toning down the entrances a notch.
sorry, comes with the job.
uh, look, I've... I've already had a pretty long day, and I gotta get to work, so if you have any life-changing bombs that you'd like to drop on me, could you please save them for later?
I'm worried about Sarah.
there's nothing to be worried about.
she got a minor concussion and a few bruises- she'll be fine.
no, that's not what I'm worried about.
she went off mission.
and not only did we lose the microchip and the FULCRUM agent, the two of you almost got killed.
okay, she went off mission to protect me, which by the way, is her job and wins her points in my book.
Sarah has feelings for you, Chuck.
feelings that will get her killed.
people we deal with are cold-blooded assassins.
they have no emotions, no feelings.
the only chance we have against FULCRUM is to think and act like they do.
anything less gets us killed.
Sarah knows what she's doing, Bryce.
Sarah Walker's room.
Oh, room 808.
just the guy I was looking for.
these are for you.
wow, Devon.
Thanks, I've never received flowers from another man before, but I suppose there's a first time for everything.
they're not from me, Chuck.
that's a relief.
they're from Sarah's ex.
I intercepted them before they got to her room.
this guy won't take no for an answer
indeed.
thanks for looking out.
Hey, that's what bros are for.
right.
Hello?
Yeah, you know what, Bryce,
I almost bought your little speech, but...
who's Bryce?
von Hayes... Von Hayes, we've been looking for you.
who is this?
uh, who?
the waiter, the waiter who, uh, who dropped that bottle of Lafite Rothschild.
how did you get my number?
I- I sent the flowers to that female agent.
Yeah, yeah, well, uh, you know,
I'm her supervisor, and your little case has made its way up the food chain, so you're gonna be dealing with me now.
if you want to stay alive, you need to tell me where that microchip is.
don't worry.
I have it, it's safe, just...
just don't let those people catch me, okay?
just get me the hell out of here, Jorge.
I'm-I'm-I'm living in a Lamborghini.
you-you can't imagine how little legroom there is.
all right, I know you're pissed off that I screwed up your perfect plans, but I have some good news.
I found the microchip.
how? Doesn't matter how.
the point is I did it.
what exactly did you do, Bartowski?
I negotiated the return of said microchip.
of course, I did have to agree to certain terms.
what terms?
well, one, he'll only make the exchange with me.
uh, two, he wants full immunity from any government prosecution.
I can live with that.
there's one... there... well, just...
sorry, there is kind of just one more little bitty thing.
what? We're gonna need roughly $4. 5 million in unmarked bills, preferably small denominations.
Oh, how am I doing?
great.
looks like we'll release you in a few hours.
Oh, great.
don't worry.
this won't hurt a bit.
well, unfortunately,
I can't promise the same.
what?
I don't like FULCRUM, so I'm only gonna ask once.
Where's your boss?
okay, here he is, Chuck.
you're on.
have you got the cash?
Yeah, I have...
I have... it's in... it's right here in the bag.
do you have the microchip?
all right, give me the cash. You first.
no, you first. I'm pretty positive you go first.
just make the exchange, moron.
I've never done a handoff before.
I'm really not used to this spy stuff.
it's a little stressful, isn't it?
Yeah. Yeah.
okay, I got an idea. Oh, yeah?
I'm gonna count to three. You're gonna count to three?
or if you want... to count to three? No, no, it's too much pressure.
you count to three, I'll... So, I'm gonna count to three.
on three or after three? What do you want?
we'll do after three, so it's like one, two, three, change.
okay, here we go: one...
trouble, Chuck. Make the exchange.
you told me I could trust you.
no. No, no, no, wait!
wait! No!
I can never get a break.
you stay here this time.
hey...
don't you need this?
give us the chip, Mr. Hayes.
don't move! Drop your weapons!
sorry, fellas.
someone's paid us a lot of money to take that chip.
hold on. Wait! Don't do anything.
no shooting.
excuse me, gentlemen.
may I have your attention, please?
um...
in my hands...
...I'm holding $4. 5 million in unmarked bills.
now, I'm not sure what the current going rate for thug-for-hire work is, but I'm feeling pretty confident that it's a lot less than this.
now, all I ask is that you let
von Hayes and my two friends here go, and the money's all yours.
or you can die horrible deaths in a hail of gunfire.
the choice is yours, really.
that was amazing!
thank you, Jorge. No, don't mention it.
all right.
no, no, no- don't encourage him.
you know, a little appreciation wouldn't kill you.
I mean, I did get the microchip back.
you also gave away $4. 5 million in taxpayer money. Nobody's perfect.
where are you going?
to get it back, idiot.
you know, I don't need Casey to tell me I'm a good spy.
I think I'm doing fine. The fact of the matter is
I mean, it's really not as hard as it's cracked up to be anyway.
okay, let's try this one more time.
the microchip.
the microchip, now. Release the kid first.
kid"? Honestly, we're born in the same year.
give me the chip and I'll let him go.
promise.
chip?
there. Now release him.
sorry.
got it?
Yeah, I got it.
take it.
take the shot, Sarah!
Sarah, take the shot!
take it!
Oh!
well, you want something done right...
you do it yourself.
Morgan, you said you got rid of them.
end him, Morgan.
my friend, please.
please fix this.
man, get off! Come on! Get him! Get him!
you're gonna buy me...
uh, Mr. Mitt, sir.
Hey, uh, we had an understanding before.
we did, before.
now we need a PlayStation 3.
I'm broke, man.
well, if that's the case, scram, you little loser.
you can't talk to him like that.
piss off, Yoko.
you can't talk to me like that.
right, Morgan?
I don't hear anything.
you guys hear anything?
Oh, did you hear that?
sweep the leg, Morgan.
sweep the leg.
just so you know,
I think my fist is bigger than your entire head.
lay off him, meatheads.
Anna, what are you doing?
saving you, babe.
um... I don't really think that that's...
Hey, I don't fight girls.
neither do I.
Oh!
can I get a background clearance on a one Anna Wu?
nice shot, Miss Wu.
I have a candidate for possible field work.
no.
what did I say about the entrances?
we need to talk about Sarah.
she had a chance to take the shot back there and she didn't.
she hesitated and almost cost us the microchip and your life.
I know.
what are you going to do about it?
I don't know, Bryce.
you tell me. What am I supposed to do?
you'll do the right thing.
you always do.
that why I sent you the Intersect in the first place.
forgot your glasses.
you keep 'em.
if you're going to be a real spy, you're gonna need them.
I don't... I don't want to be a real spy.
from what I've seen, it's a little too late for that, Chuck.
I'm sure you hate me right now.
but someday you're gonna realize I was looking out for you.
I had been all along.
I know I hesitated.
I let my guard down momentarily and it was a mistake.
but I can protect Chuck.
hand me that chammy, will you?
Hey. Hey.
everything okay?
Yeah, yeah.
just, there's, um...
I just had a couple of things
I wanted to tell you before dinner. Yeah.
me, too. Look... Look...
I'm sorry.
look, we both know how I feel about you, so I'm just gonna shoot straight.
Sarah, you're the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.
you're beautiful, you're smart, you laugh at all of my stupid jokes, and you have this horrible habit of constantly saving my life.
the truth is, you're everything that I thought I ever wanted and more.
the last few days, all I can think about is our future together, about what it's gonna be like once I finally get the Intersect out of my head, how we'll finally be together for real
no fake relationships...
no covers, no lies.
but the more I think about it, the more I realize that you and I can never have a future together.
I fooled myself into thinking that we could, but the truth is we can't.
because even if we had a real relationship, it would never really be real.
I'd still never know anything about you
your real name, your hometown, your first love, anything.
and I want more than that.
I want to be able to call you at the end of a bad day and tell you about some funny thing that Morgan did and not find out that I can't because you're off...
somewhere in Paraguay, quelling a revolution with a fork.
I'm a normal guy who wants a normal life.
and as amazing as you are, Sarah Walker, we both know that...you will never be normal.
you know, someday, when the Intersect is out of your head and you have the life that you always wanted, you'll forget all about me.
I seriously doubt that.
come on, we better get inside.
they're waiting for us.
Hey.
it's our favorite bridesmaid.
I'm so excited!
wait till you see the dresses that I picked out.
Hey, buddy.
glad to see you guys worked things out.
who knows, maybe you're next, huh?
not bad.
I hate Bryce Larkin.
just got a call from Heather Chandler, who'd like to dedicate this next song to the James Buchanan varsity football team.
go, cougars!
San Diego California 1998
in cash of emergency love you daddy you know, you don't have to keep buying stuff for cover just 'cause you're in here all the time.
Burbank California 2008
I actually needed new iPod speakers.
I'm just saying it's perfectly plausible that you're in here to discuss dinner plans with me, your boyfriend.
okay, sweetie, what are you in the mood for, Thai or Chinese?
wait, really? No, I'm still digesting my honey nut cheerios.
okay, I'm a little unprepared to discuss dinner plans at this point.
Oh, unless we're...unless we're not going to be actually eating.
will we be eating food or are we just saying we'll be eating food?
not that it really matters, it just...it'll factor into lunch, you know?
can I get a straight answer from you, Sarah?
I mean, you don't have to be so secretive or dodgy about pad Thai noodles...
bogey at your six.
Roger that-- secure the asset immediately.
take him to the orange orange.
Hey, ow, ow, okay, okay, okay.
you stay here. - Why, what's going on?
I couldn't shake a suspicious tail, so until we establish the depth of the threat, you're staying put-- don't move. Touch nothing.
wait for me, got it?
whatever.
I can't believe I'm this close to an actual DU97.
Freon-cooled, reconfigurable 30-teraflop architecture with modules for cryptanalysis and video processing.
she's so beautiful.
I know you.
and I never forget a face.
buy More, courtyard.
guess I just have one of those familiar faces. - Jackpot.
that's not it-- I know you.
I tried my hand at acting a while back.
it'll come to me.
I was on a national television commercial. I ate a messy cheeseburger.
maybe that's it.
I know exactly who you are.
we went to high school together!
what?
wait, wait, wait, don't tell me your name. I'll get it.
I never forget a face.
you look so different now.
well, for the better, I mean.
Oh, I'm sure you have me confused with someone else...
that's it: Jenny Burton!
Heather Chandler.
well, Heather Ratner now.
I married Mark Ratner.
James Buchanan high, class of '98. Go, cougars!
Heather, of course.
um, how have you been?
Oh, my god, mark, look who it is.
it's Jenny Burton.
who? - Jenny Burton from high school.
you know, the one.
Oh, yeah, hi, Jenny.
heading down for the reunion this weekend?
Oh, no, I'm not much of a reunion person.
I told you to stay put.
I know, I just, you know...
the tummy is a-rumbling.
Chuck. - Yes, honey?
is this your boyfriend?
wait, you know these people, sweetie?
I'm Heather-- we all went to high school together.
come on!
of all the semi-tart Asian influenced frozen yogurt shops in all the towns in all the world, - you walked into hers? - I know, it's crazy, right?
we live in west lake now because its closer to mark's work, but we go down there all the time.
do you? You go...
go down there, huh?
weather's real nice this time of year.
do you need a to-go lid?- Well, come on now.
weather's always great in San Diego.
Yes, it is!
that's what I always say, down there in San Diego where you're from.
I'm Chuck, by the way, but around here, people just know me as...
as Jenny's Chuck.
Jenny and chuck. Chuck and Jenny.
Chuck, I'm Mark Ratner.
brain freeze. I think I had a little too much yogurt.
what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
you got any plans? 'Cause maybe we could all get together and reminisce about old times.
sounds great.
I mean, any friends of Jenny are friends of mine.
Oh, I don't know, Chuck, it might be pretty boring for you to take a trip down memory lane with us.
good god, no, not at all.
I can't think of anything that I'd rather do than spend an evening learning all about...
my Jenny.
gather 'round, clock punchers.
big announcement.
I'm not coming in for a few days-- got a meeting.
Oh, some fat cats over at corporate?
Nope.
with a bunch of fat cat fish over in lake Havasu.
and while I'm away, Mr. Patel here will be in charge.
party hardy.
or the opposite of that?
I want you to give Lester the same respect you give me.
when you look at him, I want you to see big Mike and not some scrawny-ass Indian kid with a bay city rollers hairdo.
thank you, sir. - That's it.
back to the salt mine.
dinner? Come on!
what the hell were you thinking, Chuck?
what was I supposed to do? I flashed on the guy.
those people are from my past, a past you have no business poking around in.
well, I'm sorry, I was just trying to do my job.
I thought you'd be happy I used a little initiative.
uh, don't kill the messenger.
not the kid's fault you went to high school with a treasonous scumbag.
good morning, boys and girl.
first matter of Mark Ratner.
he's an engineer at Winthrop-Keller aeronautics, has clearance to extremely sensitive plans for future weapons technology.
picture the next generation of F-22 raptors.
essentially, a super bomber.
this technology has been leaked.
Chuck's instincts were good.
your mission is to go to dinner with the Ratners, see if Chuck flashes off of anything.
general, I apologize, but I'm afraid I must recuse myself from this mission.
my cover has been compromised.
agent Walker, you have preexisting social history with the target.
seems to me like you have the perfect cover.
but it's not a cover, ma'am, it's me.
well, I hope you enjoy Italian food.
buon appetite.
with big Mike gone, I've come up with a plan to revolutionize Buy More sales.
from now on, we're gonna work with our customers to create a mutually agreed upon price.
Yeah, but how are we supposed to do that? I mean...
as this is a teaching hospital...
watch and learn, my friends. Watch and learn.
so, you're in the market for a new TV.
Yeah. - You shopping for your mother?
what?
No,it's for me.
this one's a little dainty, isn't it?
you want the complete entertainment experience.
I would recommend this one.
uh, I can't afford this one.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
don't get caught up in this.
this...
is just a suggestion.
how about you make me an offer?
okay.
how about you shave 300 bucks off that price?
sold.
Really?
hey there. May I help you with this washer and dryer?
Oh, afraid it's not in my budget.
I'm only in the market for a dryer.
ma'am, that's like buying one new shoe.
no, no, no, no, make me an offer.
you happy with that price?
guess I'd be happier if it was 100 bucks cheaper.
I live for your smile.
let me take off $200.
deal.
I'll sell you that computer for 400 bucks off sticker price.
Hey, buddy, what's going on?
Lester's new sales policy.
we're giving away the merchandise.
throw in a wireless mouse?
throw in a wireless mouse and a bonus computer.
that's gonna end badly.
I know.
I know, Chuck.
that's part of the fun.
sold.
you're early.
technically, I'm right on time for my pre-mission debriefing.
what are you talking about?
standard spy protocol.
you know, I need some status for my cover tonight.
Chuck, I'm really... - No need to apologize if you didn't have time for full dossier preparation.
I think we'll just go over a few facts together if that's okay.
fantastic. I'll go first.
uh, tonight, I'll be playing the role of Jenny's boyfriend Chuck.
he works at the Buy More, not living up to his potential.
sister is Ellie, doctor, engaged to a doctor.
there, all up to speed on Jenny's boyfriend.
your turn.
I'm not doing this.
okay, here's what we know thus far.
Jenny Burton went to James Buchanan high school in San Diego, California, class of 1998.
is it safe to assume that "Jenny" is a diminutive of "Jennifer"?
back off, Chuck.
you have as much information as is pertinent to this assignment.
spell "Jenny" with an "I" or would...
all Jenny's boyfriend needs to know is that Jenny hates questions about her past.
you got that?
I'm good. Yeah, I'm good.
how do you do that?
so, mark, uh...
what line of work are you in? - Uh, engineering.
actually, what I'm working on is technically...top secret.
and let's keep it that way,'cause no one gives a rip.
so, how long have you two lovebirds been together?
months. - Years.
that add up to years.
you know, I don't even remember my life before Chuck.
what's the matter with you? You're sweating like a pig. It's kind of gross.
no. Oh, sorry. I'm fine. I'm fine.
would you excuse me for a minute?
sure.
so, Jenny, is your job at the yogurt shop, like, a career or are you keeping yourself in top ramen between acting gigs.
Oh, I-I've got a few things going on.
I mean, Chuck, if you had told me in high school that Jenny Burton wanted to grow up to be a movie star,
I would've said,"dream, little duckling, dream."
and now here we are.
your time is up, Mr. Ratner.
soup looks delicious, Chuck.
Mmm, it is.
cilantro, very controversial. You either love it or hate it. Me, I love it.
so, jenny, when's the last time you were down in San Diego?
mm, it's been a while.
mm, don't get to visit your dad much?
um, excuse me, more wine, please.
Ah, yes.
it's a lovely pinot noir, earthy, complex, with a hint of cherry blossoms.
so, you know when you're kids and there's always that funhouse that all the kids hang out at.
would you say that was the case with Jenny's house-condo-apartment?
Oh, my god. - I'm so sorry.
God, I'm-I'm such a spaz.
now, there's the Jenny we know.
excuse me. Beg your pardon.
not the first American tax dollars wasted on a man's lap.
give us the plans now.
I need to know that, if I hand over the plans, no harm will come to my wife.
Oh, my god. - Who the hell are you?
who is this guy?!
this is setup? - No! God, no!
he's no one! - That's a little hurtful.
he's just the boyfriend of some-some girl that I went to high school with!
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna grab some club soda to take care of my stain.
so, Heather, uh, how do you stay in such great shape?
got obsessed with karate 'cause my instructor's such a hottie.
I'm a black belt now.
I clued in you didn't want to talk about your dad's situation in front of your bf.
does Chuck not know?
uh, do you mind if I take over?
Oh, no. It's my first day.
go check on Chuck.
if you promise not to filet her before I get back. - I can't promise anything.
okay. Took a knife skills course at the culinary academy.
is that to further your yogurt career, or are you angling towards something bigger?
say, carving station at Lawry's.
so, what you know? - I don't know anything.
I just came in to do my little boy business.
turn on hand dryer, so no one hear him scream.
hear who scream? Me scream?
all right. Gonna pull the van around so we can stow these guys. Be right back.
how?
how did you do that?
uh, you know, it's a self-defense thing i took at the Y.
it was pretty comprehensive.
are you nuts? These guys are killers!
bullies are like bears, you know?
they're more afraid of you than you are of them.
or is that bees? Actually, it is bee.
anyway, when you're dealing with the Russian mob...
how, how did you know they're connected to the mob?
wait a minute. I know exactly who you are.
dude!
you're the man! - I'm hardly the man.
so who do you work for? Is it the FBI?
CIA? NSA?
I, you know, I can't discuss the particulars.
okay. I get it, I get it.
but just tell me, does-does jenny know who you really are?
Jenny knows nothing. - Of course not.
but anyway, I-I just want to thank you so much for saving my life.
can't you just tell me your name, agent...?
special agent Charles Carmichael.
this is not a negotiation.
okay, Ratner, here's how this is gonna go down.
wait. You're our waiter. From the restaurant.
man, we really screwed you on the tip.
you want into witness protection, you're gonna have to scratch our back, too.
what do you mean?
those two goons from last night, they don't report back to their boss, he's gonna want a follow-up meet.
we're gonna cover that drop. He contact you yet?
I'm sorry, but I prefer to deal only with special agent Carmichael.
the man saved my life last night.
is that right, special agent Carmichael?
it's funny...
you should really see me scale buildings with suction cups,'cause I'm...
I'm very good at that. I only dabble in the violence.
So...modesty doesn't suit you, mad dog.
mad dog? Why... Why do they call him that?
listen, I got to know where your next meet's at, okay?
and I'll ask you real politely.
my partner here, he's a maniac.
it's...it's fine when it's to protect you, but you don't want to be on the receiving end of mad dog.
that's how I got this.
I parked in his spot once.
this scar reminds me every day-- don't mess with mad dog.
now, I'm gonna ask you...let me ask you one more time.
Where's the meet?- Look, I-I don't know, okay?
he texts me. That's it, that's all I know.
he's all yours, mad dog. - No, no! I... wait a minute.
this, this is him, right now.
He's-he's-he's...he's texting me right now!
this is him!
okay, he wants to meet tonight.
but-but that doesn't work for me. I can't meet tonight.
tonight's my reunion, and my wife has really been looking forward to this
she wants to be reunion queen.
I couldn't disappoint her. - Stop talking!
you'll meet him there.
I...I-I don't know about this.
no one's gonna mess with you, man.
I got your back.
okay. Okay, I'll do it.
No! This can't be right!
No! No! No! No! No!
how did this happen?! No!
Hey, Chuck, what's up, buddy? What are you doing here? I thought it's your day off.
Yeah. I had to swing by the mall to pick something up for Sarah.
it's a long story. What's going on with Lester?
what is happening?!
is this broken?! Are you broken?!
he's been at it for, like, 15 minutes.
what's going on? Everything okay?
Chuck, thank god you're here. You-you'll know what to do.
look, so the new friendly negotiations sales strategy worked brilliantly.
right? We moved the largest volume of big-ticket merchandise in four years.
but no matter how many times I crunch the numbers, we're still out 2, 700 bucks.
well, you forgot to carry the one, so actually it's 3, 700.
What?! Oh, my god!
I'm sorry I let you down, sir.
all right, come on. Pull yourself together here, man.
all right, everybody, listen up. We are up excrement creek without a paddle. Okay?
so we're just looking for a few ideas to make a lot of cash by tonight. Any ideas?
my mom knows a dude who will torch the place.
our troubles will go up in flames.
Yeah.
while I'm impressed by the outside-of-the-box nature of Jeff's pitch, I'm thinking maybe a simpler solution.
remember when we were in high school and we were hard up for cash, so when your parents were out of town, we'd host a big kegger, invite everybody and charge by the head.
that's great, Chuck, that's perfect. That's what we're gonna do.
Yes! - No, no, no, I was...
that... I... that was a good idea if we were 16.
invite people from the mall.
and I can call my best friend, Beer, see if he can make it on such short notice.
this could actually work, this could actually work.
great, good, glad I'll be 100 miles away.
Hey, Jenny.
you must be getting pretty lonely with your dad locked up.
call me if you ever need a man around the house.
what?
brought you a present.
well, it's not my birthday.
Oh, one down, 364 and a quarter possibilities to go.
just open the box, hmm?
why do I need a new dress for?
I know you're gonna see this as a glass half-empty, but I think it's a real opportunity...
spill it! -We have to go to your reunion.
look, I know that you don't like talking about your past, much less revisiting it, but the reunion is where the drop's going down.
look, I'm sorry.
it's just... high school...
it was a tough time for me, okay?
tell me about it.
I-I-I get that.
trying to figure out who you are and what you're gonna do with the rest of your life while constantly distracted with raging hormones.
I...it was more than that for me.
hey...
it'll be okay. Trust me.
besides, everybody remembers high school way worse than it was.
you look great.
welcome cougar, class of '98!
Jennifer Burton?
Ooh, here.
Thanks.
wait. You're Jenny Burton?
I am if it says I am oh my god.
no one's gonna mess with you, Sarah, okay?
I got your back.
it's not that bad. It's not that bad. -Ahh, thanks glade...
thank you.
remember, the only difference between high school and a high school reunion is that you don't get suspended for being drunk.
want to dance?
fortunately for you, I was at the top of my game in '98.
Oh, a little bit of that.
come that, oh, and then...
and then mirror that, you know, just kind of...
what? What is it? You okay?
so, my buddies and I checked out the room and picked the best-looking girl here.
decided to come introduce myself to the woman I'll be waking up with tomorrow.
Dick Duffy. -And I'm Chuck, Jenny's boyfriend, so...
Jenny? Wait.
Damn!
ten years has been very sweet to you.
thank you.
ten years is a hell of a long time, especially to someone living in an eight by ten cell.
how is your dad?
paroled
nachos! Nachos!
I smell nachos!
that's gonna hit the spot. Let's get some nachos.
Bye, Dick.
I think that's him, that's the guy.
what guy? -Duffy.
I just flashed on Duffy. What'd you do? Attend bad guy high?
what are you talking about?
well, Duffy has some kind of connection to the Russian mob.
I'm pretty sure 's the guy that ratner is supposed to connect with to hand off the super-bomber plans.
makes sense. He always been a jerk.
okay, you go catch Ratner up, have him set up the meet.
I'll tip off the DJ.
Why? Why the DJ?
dude, look at this. We're in a sweet spot.
people are loving this.
I can't believe this is actual working.
take off your shoes!
take off your shoes!
tell them to wipe their feet, right?
keep it...will you please keep it down?
keep the fingers off the merchandise over there, please.
please. Please. We got to be considerate of the neighbors, okay?
no, no, no, no, no, no! No! No!
this the way you people treat your own homes?!
my bosses at Langley have informed me that that's the guy who's been texting you.
our target is Dick Duffy?
of course!
the guy who terrorizes me in high school is now going to terrorize the entire world with my super-bomber.
you're gonna be just fine.
you have my personal guarantee.
uh, excuse me, Dick?
I believe I'm supposed to see you about a certain transaction.
you're the last guy I thought I'd be having this conversation with.
all right, fine. Meet me outside in five minutes.
welcome class of '98!
go cougars.
never should have stolen the bomber plans.
I should have gone right to you guys.
but they threatened my wife. I wasn't thinking straight.
you see, I'm just a guy who likes math, you know, and somehow I got a beautiful girl like that to fall in love with me.
I have to pinch myself sometimes.
it's like I'm dreaming.
Ah, forget it, agent Carmichael.
I mean, how can I expect a cool guy like you to understand?
you know what, Mark?
sometimes the nerd gets the girl.
in the middle of something?
got time for you.
Where's your boyfriend at?
Oh, don't worry about him.
can't believe you're that same Jenny from high school.
you've changed so much.
well, I'm still the same girl on the inside.
bet you miss your daddy.
he's been gone so long.
but you know, baby, you can always call me daddy.
that's all right. I like my ladies rough.
great.
now we know he's a perv, don't know if he's the perp.
Yeah, sorry. I'm just working out some childhood issues.
knockoff watches, bootleg dvds.
he came out here to sell Ratner a dime bag.
guy's small time.
so if Duffy isn't our guy, then who is?
my husband spilled everything to the feds.
that's him and his handler.
I overheard them talking.
he's some CIA bad ass named Carmichael.
kill 'em both.
give him to me.
find your own freakin' fish!
that's it!
party's over! Get out!
right now!
I mean, was I born to be a lawman?
no.
I'd say it's more of a calling.
I got a bit of the shine.
Oh, no.
what's oh, no?
slight wrinkle in the plan, got to improvise.
move!
welcome!
James buchanan high, class of '98! Go cougars!
uh, for those of you who remember me,
I clearly need no introduction, and for those of you who don't,
I'm not up here to talk about myself anyway.
no.
I'm here to talk to you about some people that will cause you to flash, flash back, that is.
so, maybe with a...
with a few hints and a little bit of luck, we can find two special cougars, and throw some love on them.
Oh, how about...
how about this guy, huh?
drooled his way through spanish class?
I know you do, Michael.
and, uh, who, uh...
who else do we have?
Hey, she is a part of this.
you go. -I got these two.
how about, uh...
how about this guy here? Come on, folks.
I know you know him.
our one and only Chippy Sternin!
remember, all-star pole-vaulter, who was unfortunately sidelined with a horrible case of impetigo?
come on, let's go.
I was rooting for you, buddy.
I thought you were gonna go all-state, but you know what?
it wasn't in the cards.
come on, love on those guys really.
Heather, why'd you do it?
revenge of the cheerleaders.
we marry the geeks because they're the ones with the future.
but my husband wasn't ambitious enough.
and they were offering a lot of money.
who do you work for? I can help you.
I'm self-employed.
your name has been at the top of my list of 'people who need good ass-kicking'.
get in the locker now, Ratner.
you have three seconds to tell me where the plans are.
agent Carmichael, help!
before I go here's a classic from 1998.
help!
let me out!
Hello?
you should've been suspicious of me right off.
I mean, why would a girl like me ever fall in love with a dorky nerd like him?
you'd be surprised.
thanks a lot, mad dog.
always count on you to be in the right place at the right time.
I knew you wouldn't let me down, agent Carmichael.
glad I'm not the one who has to tell ratner about his wife's involvement in all this.
that's why love is for suckers.
Yeah. Hey, you seen Sarah anywhere?
sucker.
now, I got to ask.
how'd you wind up working for the feds?
I mean, if you had told me in high school that Jenny Burton wanted to grow up to be an agent,
I would've said, dream, jailbird's daughter, dream.
guess you didn't follow in daddy's footsteps after all.
go cougars.
and the queen of the class of 1998's ten-year reunion is...
where are you?
there you are!
come on up here, Jenny.
see you at the 20th, Jenny!
don't worry.
we'll fix this.
It'll-it'll be all good.
it'll be all good.
come on, guys, we're almost there.
big Aike's gonna be here any minute. Let's go!
listen up, listen up, listen up.
um, first of all, I just want to acknowledge that I know I'm not the easiest man to work for, but I want to thank you for all your hard work.
and mean it this time.
I mean, guys, what we've accomplished here is incredible.
and each and every one of you is a big , shining star.
Oh, mother crapper, the fish!
Glue's still a little wet, but we had no choice, dude.
you did all this for me when I haven't always been very kind to you?
may I ask you why?
I don't know, man.
I thought, you know, if I was there for you selflessly, that you would see that people are essentially kind at heart.
you know, and maybe you wouldn't walk around so afraid in this world.
dude, are you crying?
come on, I'm just doing my job.
Oh, Mike's coming.
work you've done here is outstanding.
everyone's on time, store is tidy.
even smells like a pine-scented forest.
nice touch, patel.
will you look at these sales totals?
with the kind of brisk business you've done here in my absence,
I should go away more often.
sir, if I might, um, the truth is that the, the pressure of management, it's, it's just too much.
I would really, uh, appreciate it if I could just resume my former position.
you sure, son?
Yes. Yes, thank you.
what the hell?
isn't that supposed to be a raw steak?
not on a Buy More salary, thank you very much.
I did, however, scrape together enough cash to get you a cooked one as well.
medium rare with...
extra pickles? -Extra pickles.
come on, who do you think you're dealing with here?
well, I never doubted you, special agent Charles Carmichael.
so I guess the big secret about you is that you used to be just a typical high school student.
wish I knew what happened to change that.
nice toss.
who are you?
I'm the man who put your father in prison.
the question is: Who are you?
in San Diego, you go by Jenny Burton.
in Wisconsin, it's Katie O'connell.
in Cleveland, it's Rebecca Franko.
funny thing is when I looked at your birth certificate...
I get your point.
what do you want?
your father scammed some pretty dangerous people.
I saved his life by putting him in jail.
well, don't expect a thank-you note.
I can save your life, too.
no, not that way.
your dad trained you pretty well.
the CIA can do even better.
you like names so much, hmm?
what do you think about Sarah Walker?
Sarah? Sarah Walker, hello.
okay, fine.
I'll answer one question about my past.
you've earned that much.
no, thanks.
I don't need to know more, not about who you were, 'cause as much as you don't think so, I know who you are.
a girl I'd like to share a cheeseburger with.
should I get a knife? I'll get a knife.
that won't be necessary.
that's awesome and a little disturbing.
no one stops us.
no one ever has.
Chuck, did you just flash?
Oh, Chuck me.
kill him.
guys...
I know kung fu.
: agent Carmichael.
call me "Charles."
you have something that belongs to my boss, Yuri: the case.
I would like for you to give it to me.
please?
you show up with no gun and "Please"?
what, I quiver in fear?
BECKMAN: Chuck, we've got a lock on the case.
it's there iomith you.
give me the case...or else.
or else I do this?
no, I was thinking something more like this.
cool, cool, cool! Everybody be cool! Everybody just chill out!
very, very good. On the ground now.
nice and easy.
now, Yuri, hand me the case, and then after that, it's pirogi time.
BECKMAN: Shoot him, Chuck.
do it.
shoot me.
don't mess with me, Yuri.
BECKMAN: Shoot him now!
get him!
BECKMAN: Chuck, what is happening? Your heart rate just spiked. Are you okay?
I'm okay.
I got punched in the face. It's throbbing a little bit.
get out of there now!
Where's my exit?
they're closing in on you. Get to a roof. Chopper's...
let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
listen, General, I don't want to sound demanding here, but I could really use that chopper right about now!
the chopper's too far out.
satellite says there's a power line on the roof that runs to the next building.
zip line across, we'll find you a new exit...
what do you mean, zip line?
it's in the Intersect.
okay, I got this.
Oh, God. Oh, God.
general, I don't think this is a good idea. I'm not flashing.
do it, Chuck! Flash!
look, if you stress me out, it's never going to work.
Chuck, flash!
flash.
one, two, three, flash.
I don't think my vertigo is helping here.
general, are you there?
general?
Yuri: You're dead.
that's all, Frank. Terminate the simulation.
: copy that, ma'am.
you can come down now.
BECKMAN: Why didn't you shoot Yuri, Chuck?
well, we were very close, and while I realize it's just a simulation, safety first, you know?
and to be perfectly honest, I'm still not comfortable with the whole shooting people thing.
this isn't working out.
look, General, I realize that we've had our setbacks, I-I do, but let's not dwell in the past here.
I'm convinced I can be a great spy. I know it.
we've spent millions of dollars to get you up and running as our new Intersect agent.
it's not working.
well, maybe my dad can help. He built the computer.
the problem is not with the computer.
it's with you.
the Intersect 2. 0 was designed to go into a real spy, like Bryce Larkin, someone in complete control of their feelings.
what are you saying?
it's over.
our Los Angeles field unit will keep an eye on you until a final decision can be made regarding your status.
wait, hold on just-just a second here.
are you saying you're firing me, General?
do you...You have any idea what I gave up for this?
good-bye, Chuck.
you don't know what I said no to!
CASEY: Go home, tell your sister you went on a last-minute trip to Europe, six weeks.
CHUCK: Okay. Where are we really going?
CASEY: To a Red Site training facility.
training for what?
they're gonna train you to use it, turn you into a real super-spy.
CHUCK: Sarah, did Casey tell you they're moving me to a training facility?
I'm going to be a real spy.
I know, I heard. Come on.
What...?
what's the matter?
if you do this, if you go, you're gonna be a spy for the rest of your life.
every city is gonna be a new mission and a new identity, and you're not gonna be the same person.
Yeah. That's a great thing.
Chuck, listen.
we could...
we could what?
we could run?
together. You and me. We go now, and we never look back.
are you serious?
I have some money saved up.
I'd have to get us some new identities, create an escape route.
for now, go to the training facility in Prague, then meet me at the Nadrazi train station in three weeks' time at 7: 00, and then I can figure the rest out later.
what are you saying?
I'm saying I want to be a real person again.
with you.
this is what you want, right?
I mean, this is it, Chuck.
will you run away with me?
Yeah.
Chuck, what happened?
Chuck, honey, where's Sarah?
I lost her.
the girl of my dreams. It was all my fault.
well, maybe not. Why don't you just pick up the phone and call her?
you guys can work it out.
I'm sure she misses you, too.
your phone, my dear.
pick up, Sarah.
morning Chuck.
morning, bro.
Chuck, you feeling any better? You got a game plan? Job hunting?
probably not.
no rush, amigo, but how long you think you'll be staying?
Chuck, if you won't talk to me, then you have a visitor.
it's-it's me, man.
is that you?
I-I'm back for a few days. Hawaii is great. And Benihana...
forget about it.
flying through the ranks .
that's it, man. I'm gonna be master chef in no time.
I'm so proud of you.
we should get together soon, you know.
you and I sit down and...
worse than I thought.
all right, Chuck, that is enough!
sit up! You are getting off this couch.
and you are going to do something today.
out! Out!
Morgan: I tried, guys.
ELLIE: Leave him with his cheese balls. That's all he cares about.
Hello, sir.
how may I service you?
I'm looking for cheese puffs?
aisle 3. It's been a pleasure serving you.
look at that wretch.
security, we have a street person in aisle 3.
could be the one stealing toilet paper from the bathroom.
gotcha.
hand it over, punk.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
get a good look, everybody. Everybody, everybody, come hither. Come hither.
take a sniff.
that is the putrid stench of failure.
that's why you don't leave the Buy More.
you become feral.
wretched.
you're just another loser.
my God, you're pathetic.
sneaking back into the Buy More like some...vagrant Serpico.
goodness. You're a hot mess.
Emmett, please.
I'm sorry. Do you have something to say? Right here.
no, I have nothing to say. I'm good. I'm okay. I'm good.
Oh, that's what I thought.
well, it's a good thing because you don't know how close you came to getting your ass kicked.
Oh, Captain, my Captain!
please tell us that you've returned to take control of the Buy More!
look, I'm...
I'm sorry, fellas.
I'm-I'm sorry, everyone. I don't think I could help even if I tried.
Yeah, no, I know. I know. What do you care about our troubles?
you still got blondie.
actually, we're not...
agreed. Her ass seems to be lifting ever so slightly.
listen, Charles...
ass.
just through the lens of a telescope when she goes in and out of that nasty yogurt shop.
she's still here?
Sarah? Hello?
heard you were a lemon, but this is pathetic, Bartowski.
even for you.
what the hell are you doing here?
I think that I left a light jacket in Castle.
I was just here to pick it up.
clean those up.
hurry it up. I gotta finish packing.
what's been going on in the biz?
you, uh, talk to any of the old gang?
Sarah, for instance?
Nope.
Really?
yeah?
can I talk to her when you're done?
Yeah.
1899/12/31 0: 07: 00
just tell her...
if you could just ask her if she's gotten my messages because I've been calling...a lot.
it's the Lemon.
duly noted. See ya tonight.
did she say anything about me?
Nope.
Hey, you guys going on a mission?
you need backup? I can still flash.
not what I heard.
come on, Casey, please.
Beckman canned me, all right, man.
I need to prove to her that I can still do this.
that I can still be a spy.
can you?
and this could work, too.
because if I help you guys, then maybe Beckman puts the old team back together.
and all my dreams come true.
what?
I'm heading out.
enjoy your spy game thing.
and stay in touch.
what happened between you and Walker?
something I need to fix.
um, somebody called about a computer emergency.
sound board's down.
cool. Thanks.
Walker, we have a situation.
Hello, Chuck.
what are you doing here?
don't worry. This is not about us. I'm purely here for backup.
I need to prove to Beckman...
kiss me.
don't you think we should talk first? I'm getting mixed signals.
kiss me now!
who the hell is that?
just my ex. He's having some trouble letting go.
why'd you knock him out?
it was a slap.
lemon's got a glass jaw.
I was caught off guard on an empty stomach, okay?
I didn't eat anything. I can take a punch.
you mean a slap.
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry, guys.
I didn't mean to screw anything up.
I just came here to help out.
things went wrong in Prague, I don't know why, but I know that I can do this.
I can be a spy.
Sarah, you know I can. Please.
get him out of here. You heard the lady.
get out of here. Casey, wait, wait, wait. I can help you.
Bartowski, it's a simple courier exchange.
Gilles, the guy with Walker, he's the mark.
he's meeting with a major Ring operative tonight.
the Ring? They killed Bryce.
the moment the Ring courier meets with Gilles, we strike.
now, get out of here before you spook Javier.
who?
: get him out of here.
Casey, Javier's not a courier! Guys, you have to listen to me.
Javier's not who you think he is!
he's an assassin! Trust me!
he's here to kill someone.
CASEY: We dumped the Lemon.
let me back in!
: come on. Come...
okay. Okay. All right. All right.
Oh, son of a...
that's going to leave a mark.
calm down, Chuck.
don't be emotional.
excuse me.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
my bad. Wake up. Oh, God.
where have you been? You're on.
let's go!
I have to use the little boys'...the little chicos' room, little amigos' room.
Hola! Como estas?
Hey, where's Manny?
spastic colon. I'm filling in for him.
he's going to blow the whole op!
just give him a second.
bueno, bueno, bueno, bueno.
where the hell did he learn that?
isn't that your ex?
Yeah, he's a bit of a show-off.
just ignore him.
: assassin.
assassin.
do you want my men to take care of your ex?
uh, no.
come dance with me.
what is he doing here?
he's just trying to make you jealous. And that's supposed to be your job.
wait. How did he know you were here? Who is he really?
tranq him! Take him out now!
you have nothing to worry about.
GILLES: What's going on?
man: Don't move! Don't you move!
Chuck, what the hell are you doing?
there's a...There's an assassin here.
there's an assassin here, people.
he was gonna kill her. He was gonna kill you.
where? Where is he?
half this club is undercover, Chuck.
CASEY: Been planning this for months.
good thing we brought this many agents 'cause I'm gonna kill you!
Sarah, I flashed.
I swear to you, there was an assassin here.
it was Javier.
now we'll never know.
you don't work anymore, Chuck. It's over.
good morning.
Chuck, you shaved. That's great.
it was a rash decision.
I can't bear to watch him wallow around like this all day.
it's pathetic.
what's up, bro?
still playing the loser cover?
you're nailing it.
not a cover.
it's my life.
I was fired for real.
I'm not a spy anymore.
and to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure I ever really was.
wait.
this is really you?
maybe we should be introduced.
I'm Chuck Bartowski, total loser, cheese ball addict.
does the CIA let you just leave like that?
don't they send someone to, like, kill you or something?
think you've watched too many movies.
don't kill me!
holy, dude. It's-It's just...It's me.
Ellie thought I should come by and...
thought I might cheer you up.
Yeah, well, thanks, but I wish everyone would just leave me alone because I'm fine.
no, you're not, dude.
come on.
I've known you a long time, pal.
you're slightly motivated, a bit of an underachiever, but a loser?
it's not your turf.
what's going on?
I blew it, buddy.
opportunity of a lifetime.
without getting into specifics, I had a job offer that would have included a lot of travel and excitement, and I've already been fired from it twice.
amateur hour.
you haven't even scratched the surface.
you want to see rock bottom?
follow me, sir.
so, I got canned from Benihana a few weeks ago, and Anna took off with the prep chef.
I lost my mojo.
couldn't flip the shrimp.
couldn't flip the shrimp.
bed, TV, microwave for meals.
and of course, machine for laundry.
drink in it, Chuck.
this is as low as a man can get.
so he's been the one stealing the TP.
well, I should have known he'd never make it in an Asian business culture.
I'll have the authorities deal with him tomorrow.
I'm gonna miss this.
what?
M-134 mini-gun.
3, 400 rounds a minute.
never got to use her.
poor bastard.
who?
moron that's still in love with you.
I promise you, Casey, he's not in love with me.
Oh, come on.
I don't know what happened between you two. Don't want to.
just saying I've seen men have their fingernails pulled off treated more humanely than you did that kid.
well, I was just doing my job.
job's over.
put him out of his misery.
he deserves that much.
can I help you?
CHUCK: Where can I find this man?
Oh, don't ask me.
he's no longer an employee at this store.
if you want to find him, you can walk out front and follow the smell.
you can leave now.
okay. Okay.
we can do this, or the hard way.
I got Mace.
Yeah.
so you better get your Brokeback boots off my property, or I'm gonna send you crying back to your mommy's womb.
Morgan: Say good-bye forever, pal.
had some good years here.
Yeah, to be honest, I think I'd rather forget it all ever happened.
right. Uh, why don't I give you guys a few seconds, and I'll just see you back at your place?
Thanks, buddy.
Hey, Sarah.
I wanted to say a proper good-bye.
it's been a pleasure working with you, Agent Walker.
you, too, Agent Bartowski.
I appreciate that, but I think we both know that the whole agent thing didn't really work out.
if I could go back in time...
uh, Chuck?
okay, at least I can live knowing that I told you everything about how I felt.
you owe me that.
and I owed you that.
Oh, Javier.
uh, you know, I think we actually got off on the wrong foot.
truth be told, I'm a huge fan of mariachi music.
and my hitting you was completely unintentional.
I want to know who you are.
nobody. I'm nobody.
in fact, I think that I have documentation somewhere that-that proves that I'm an official nobody.
you are extremely ripped, sir.
CHUCK: You hit me very well outside the club.
try that again.
okay, let's do this. Let's do this.
freaking flash.
if you could just give me one second.
you're going to tell me everything, Mr. Bartowski.
all the secrets you know.
who you are, who you work for.
and then, you're going to tell me about the girl.
Sarah: For now, you should go to Prague, and then meet me at the Nadrazi train station in three weeks' time at 7: 00, and then we can figure the rest out later.
here is your ticket and your new passport.
your name is Hector Caldaron.
Sarah, wait.
right now we have to act fast.
trust me, Chuck. It's all going to work out fine.
that's not the kiss that I was expecting.
Sarah, there is an entire facility here dedicated and designed to turning me into Intersect 2. 0
I mean, think about it.
think about that. Me, a real spy, you know, living a life of adventure, and doing things that really matter.
it's not that simple. You don't know who you're working for.
it's complicated. Nothing is real.
this...
this is simple.
this is real life.
we have to go, Chuck. This is it.
are you coming?
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
CASEY: Any sign of Walker?
man: Last ping had her at the Buy More.
you gotta be kidding me.
I want a real-time satellite trace on every car that's been in the Buy More parking lot in the last six hours.
do it. Get the chopper ready.
sir, on whose authority?
mine.
the Colonel.
come on, Chuck. You can do this.
just one flash of kung fu and we are out of here.
I'm dead. I'm so completely dead.
what am I going to do?
Chuck, can you hear me?
I need you to break out of your cell and come and get me.
I couldn't pick this stupid lock!
there's no way. That we could reverse those roles, is there?
you can do this. You've been trained to do this.
the Intersect can do this.
Sarah, you don't get it. You and Casey were right, okay.
I'm-I'm a lemon. I don't work.
my emotions just mess everything up.
no.
Chuck, listen, I was mad...and wrong.
and ever since you went to Prague, I have worked with the best spies in the world.
and you know what?
they're on their way her to save us?
none of them can do what you can do.
you're a spy. Now flash on Javier and get us out of here.
something's happening here, Sarah.
don't freak out.
when I'm done with you, I'm going to deal with her.
a girl.
me first.
Chuck? What happened?
Something...awesome!
let's go.
Hey, you should've seen it.
I knocked him out with one punch. One punch.
that's great. Let's talk and run.
CHUCK: Where are we?
Chuck, I'm almost out. We need to get off this roof.
what are you doing?
zip line.
it'll work. I promise.
I trust you.
hold on tight.
I can't believe that worked!
I'm not so sure it did.
there's something I need to tell you.
not now, Chuck.
actually, I think this might be my last chance.
javier Cruz was a vital operative for The Ring's Mexico Syndicate.
the device you picked up is a custom smart phone for Ring operatives.
this is the first one we have ever capture
Hey, good job, Team Bartowski.
general, Colonel Casey and I will be departing for Lisbon tonight.
there's been chatter that another Ring cell is operating there.
that won't be necessary.
why not?
I can't believe I'm about to say this...
say it.
I mean...
please say .
I'm putting Operation Bartowski back into the field.
Yes!
Casey, Sarah, you will work alongside Agent Bartowski to bring down the Ring.
that is all.
this is great! Come on, guys.
the three of us, the old gang, back together again.
I cannot wait.
Hey, what's my new cover going to be?
cause I-I need a new job. Can it be something exciting?
race car driver?
it's gotta be something cool.
I can't believe you got me this job back so quickly.
Yeah, well, with no manager, the paperwork was easy to push through.
so, Emmett really took a Large Mart job in Anchorage?
that's the rumor.
well, good for him.
Oh, also, thanks for doing that extra favor.
what?
I speak of the bearded one.
Morgan: We're back!
up high.
there he goes.
he's busy. Work, work, work, that guy.
are you ready for this?
someone from corporate called me and pretty much begged me to take my job back.
did they?
I guess they know talent.
they do indeed, my friend.
Sarah, I need you to keep Chuck's emotions in check so the Intersect can work.
he listens to you, but he's also an unstable element.
do you think he's dangerous?
very, but he's worth the risk.
for the last two years, we protected Chuck from the world.
but, now, we have to protect the world from Chuck.
Captain: Hey, do we really need all this stuff?
Oh, hey, guys.
Hey, Devon.
Hey, El. What's happening?
uh, well, we're moving.
Yeah, uh, the apartment CHUCK across the courtyard opened up.
so, we're taking it.
we needed a place for two and you can get a roommate.
you have plenty of friends.
I'm so happy right now.
other friends, Chuck.
other friends.
listen to me, listen to . two words.
bachelor pad.
I got dibs on Ellie's room.
we should talk.
Absolutely.
I'll go first. I'll go first.
Sarah, they wanted me to be a spy, okay.
they told me that I could make a difference.
for years, I been...
I been kicking around not knowing what I wanted to do with my life like a...like a loser.
and then one day really important people told me that they thought I could change the world.
me. Chuck Bartowski.
it was never about you...
stop.
I acted impulsively.
and it's a mistake I don't usually make.
and it won't happen again.
but, Sarah...
you have to keep your feelings to yourself.
numbnuts.
ready?
ready for what?
your training. Come on.
you have much to learn, grasshopper.
have you flashed yet?
take a breath.
let's do this.
Hannah, there are things in my life that you can't understand.
so I have to end this.
Chuck, I think we need to talk. Not a good time.
are you suggesting Chuck is caught in a big, giant web of conspiracy and deception?
I'm gonna have to lie to your sister, and I can't do that anymore.
from now on, if Ellie asks you something, just say "I don't know.
you two got it bad for this blond.
it's about keeping his emotions in check so that the Intersect can work.
flash.
come on.
you know what, Casey? You're right.
I don't work. My emotions just mess everything up.
Hey, guys, I got your call.
what's, uh...
what's going on?
you're the Intersect. You tell us.
we've intercepted intel that the Ring is planning to turn and use a CIA agent against us.
the problem is, we don't know who, when or where.
did you flash?
uh, yeah. Not, uh, not flashing.
ever since Rafe tried to kill Sarah and me.You haven't flashed in a week,Chuck.
that's a problem.
problem?
Really? Problem? Kind of a strong word, don't you think? Just 'cause a guy had a couple off nights.
off nights get agents killed.
now you need to figure this out, because the Intersect's not working.
okay, so, what exactly are you saying?
I'm saying that until you start flashing again, you're no longer a spy.
no. No.
no, you can't... you can't do that.
being a spy is all that I have.
I gave up everything for this.
well, maybe some time off will do you good, Chuck.
it'll help you function again.
I don't need - I don't need time off, okay?
maybe I'm not flashing because I have all these emotions bottled up in me.
you ever thought about that?
I mean, I just broke up with Hannah,
I can't talk to my best friend or my sister about anything in my life.
I'm not a machine.
okay, I am a machine, but I'm also a person.
well, you can always talk to us.
Yeah, uh, no thanks.
I don't think that's going to work for me.
find something that does work.
because until you do, you're benched.
Mmm, this getaway was the perfect idea, honey.
it's just what we needed. You said it, babe.
I can't tell you how awesome it feels to be alone, just the two of us.
sorry.
it's okay.
I'll be just a sec.
Hey, Chuck.
awesome, hey. Thank God you picked up.
everything okay, Chuck? No, no, not really.
I broke up with Hannah, and-and Sarah's falling for another guy.
not only is my personal life a mess, but my spy life, too...
Chuck, I went on vacation to get away from your spy life.
okay? And to fix things with Ellie.
no, no. Devon, Devon, Devon.
Devon, Devon, I don't have anyone else to talk to.
I'm sorry, bro.
but remember what you said about discussing your spy life:
I don't know.
I say he can get it in there, but I agree with you, it seems impossible.
so, put your wagers in.
what do you got in your pockets?
please report to the assistant manager's office for disciplinary action.
right? Ah.
Oh, my!
this is a shocker!
he got it in.
I'm saying, do not wager against the brown beauty and the snake.
have a seat, please.
you need anything? You okay?
uh, no, I'm-I'm-I'm good.
I mean, you know, maybe a little more leg room would be nice.
this conversation is never an easy one to have with an employee, Chuck.
and what conversation would that be, exactly?
we've known each other most of our lives.
hmm. We, uh, we went through puberty together.
we went through the awkward stage after puberty, the awkward high school years, your awkward college years, and now, our current awkward Buy More years.
which is why this moment for me is so very...
awkward?
Yeah.
Morgan, what exactly is going on?
something is. Something is going on in your life.\
you dumped Hannah.
she quit the Buy More.
she was a valued member of the store.
and I just feel that a true best friend would share that with his true best friend.
you really want to know the truth?
I do.
I am ready.
okay, here goes.
I...
okay. Got it.
you don't have to say any more. Say wha -?
I didn't say anything. Mor - do you need help?
I'm fine. No.
I cannot believe I'm saying this, but...
you're fired.
wha - what?
you're firing me from the Buy More?
buy More? No, are you kidding me?
you're the best Nerd Herder we have.
I need you here.
I'm firing you as my best friend.
Hey! You guys, uh-you guys leaving on the mission?
you sure you don't want me to join?
we'd love you to, Chuck, but the Intersect is not working.
the agent that the Ring plans to turn is staying at this hotel.
we have no record of any spy being there, so whoever it is is deep undercover.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm still not flashing.
we've got to go.
guys, the team's a man short without me.
not today. I'm taking your place on this mission.
the Ring knows that you're still alive, Shaw.
it's too dangerous for you to be in the field.
and I can't leave this team shorthanded.
besides, if the Ring wants a fight, I'll give them a fight.
you two newlyweds ready?
Yeah, let's go.
what's with the-the... rings?
What...?
Hey, Casey. What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
don't you have a day job?
Hey, what's going on, guys?
Charles, please!
it's a spy mission. You are not qualified. Get away.
I...
el Segundo School of Finance, we take care of business!
what's going on here, Big Mike?
someone's thinking of buying the store.
we're closing today so some building inspectors and technicians can come down and kick the tires.
sweet. We get the day off. Jeffrey, let's get pershnickered.
no.
they want to interview everyone.
reevaluate the entire staff.
gonna fire everyone who's not essential.
we're in big trouble, boys.
here are your keys.
enjoy your stay here at the Malibu Vista Hotel.
might I add that the two of you are a very beautiful couple.
Oh. Thank you.
you two lovebirds have fun while I'm cooped up in the van again.
have a margarita for me.
there's a Ring agent somewhere in this hotel.
we need to find him.
I tapped into the phone's mainframe.
if the Ring calls out again, we can trace it back to the room it originated from.
Sarah and I have set up the surveillance equipment.
we'll begin searching for possible targets.
listen up, team.
these suits are sharks.
they'll try to divide us in our interviews, find our weaknesses, look for any excuse they can to fire our asses.
listen, despite our differences, all we have is each other.
so let's, uh, let's stick together here, all right?
this is a blood oath right here.
one for all, and all for one. All right.
Yeah, I've found it! Found it! Contact lens.
all crisis averted.
I love you guys.
come on down. All right.
Oh, my God. We're doomed.
have a seat, yeah.
okay, so...
before I spill this place's dirty secrets,
I want to know that I'm protected.
I want diplomatic immunity.
I - I don't think it's appropriate in this situation.
bah, bah, bah, bah bah, bah, bah. You want the dirt?
I want immunity.
okay.
immunity granted.
okay.
thank you, my brother.
well...
it's an interesting group of employees you put together here.
Oh, they scare me, too.
but I got Bartowski, don't I?
Mm-hmm. That's right.
a man with a Stanford degree is working here.
you see, gentlemen, I'm not just a manager;
I'm a people person.
morgan Grimes, assistant manager, how are you, sir?
Morgan, hey, buddy,
I need to talk to you.
NClearly you don't, Chuck, or I wouldn't have fired you as my best friend.
can I please just have a minute?
not now, Chuck, all right?
I'm freaking out about this interview, man.
look. Hey, buddy?
you're going to be fine.
besides, it's only the Buy More. You can always get another job.
it's not the end of the world. Really?
see, it may not be the end of the world to you, but I don't have a Stanford degree, Chuck.
I can't do anything else but the Buy More.
this job is all I have.
Chuck Bartowski? You're up.
that's an impressive.
so what's a Stanford grad doing working at a Buy More?
uh, you know, let's just say the-the Buy More offers more opportunities than initially meets the eye.
Really?
for instance?
for instance, I get to work with my best friend every day.
your best friend?
Yeah.
the, uh, the assistant manager.
based on your track record, you're the cream of this Buy More crop.
why aren't you the assistant manager?
because the right guy has already got the job.
I - I know that you guys are maybe gonna be making some changes around here, so I just want you to know that while I might look good on paper,
I'm not the cream of the crop.
morgan Grimes is.
okay, the Ring just made a call from the hotel.
I'll connect you in while I trace it back.
the target is by the pool.
six foot two, well built.
he's wearing a blue and white bathing suit.
you got that, Walker? Yeah, I got it.
did you find the target?
Yeah, we found him.
Cheers. it's so nice
nice to meet you. Yeah, you, too.
really good egg, yeah.
really good egg.
well, ha-have a good day.
Hey, you too. Take care.
get the others in here.
so, you really think this Bartowski guy is Agent Carmichael?
Oh, it's Carmichael, all right.
looks like Shaw left him behind to man the fort.
should we abort the mission?
no, with Shaw not here, it's our best chance to infiltrate and recover everything he has on us.
have you found the entrance into Shaw's base yet?
no. We don't have much time.
we have to find it fast.
do you want us to take out Bartowski?
not yet.
let's keep interviewing employees and make sure Shaw didn't leave any other surprises behind.
Chuck said Grimes is his best friend.
we can use both of them to our advantage.
what do you want me to do about the others?
I think we need to be conservative here.
getting away is the best thing we could've done, babe.
I know I haven't been the same guy lately, but since we got here,
I gotta tell you, I feel awesome again.
me, too. To us.
no stress, no work, no problems.
the call came from Room 4305.
I'll head there now and search it.
we'll go down to the pool, get Devon and Ellie out of harm's way.
come on, flash!
Oh, I know, I know this.
uh, uh, The Condor? Uh, The Jackal?
chan Min Chi.
damn it, I thought I had that one.
this better be good.
Hey, yeah, hey, just, just checking in on the mission.
seeing if you guys needed anything.
why, are you flashing now?
no, I'm not. But I thought, you know, maybe if you throw me the rock, I'll pop on something.
I don't have time for this, Bartowski.
only as good as your last flash, huh?
how's the water?
what are you two doing here?
you're not supposed to be here.
I just reclaimed my awesomeness.
we got a tip that the Ring was trying to turn an agent staying at this hotel.
you.
me?
but I'm not an agent.
Chuck told me that I was in the clear.
are Ellie and I in danger?
I don't know.
I can't believe they're selling the Buy More.
Oh, man, I think they're really serious about buying this place.
cause they have been going through it with a fine tooth comb.
even checking lockers.
it was really great talking to you.
you gotta help me, Morgan.
I got contraband in my locker.
what kind of contraband?
just a little something I use to take the edge off on a stressful day.
if they find it, Ill be fired for sure.
Mr. Barnes...
Morgan, please.
okay, all right, dude.
I'm at the Ring agent's room.
I'm going in.
be careful.
I'm always careful.
the target is by the pool.
he's wearing a blue and white bathing suit.
our operatives are in position.
Ugh, it's a set-up.
I gotta get Ellie out of here.
I got to get both of us out of here right now.
keep it together, Devon.
we'll figure this out.
we've been setup. about mission -casey
what? What was that?
I'm so sorry, false alarm.
wait, you crashed my weekend getaway to tell me I'm in danger and now you tell me what, we're safe?
Yes, I'm sorry.
please try and enjoy the rest of your vacation.
we gotta get away from this.
Oh, my God.
found something.
there's a tunnel behind these lockers.
fingerprint scanner.
this must be it. Go get Del and Neil.
tell them we found the CIA base.
good work.
tell the others we found Shaw's base.
Oh, my God.
this is not right, no!
you understand me? Hey.
what's going on?
my spy work paid off, obviously.
I mic'd Big Mike's office.
all I got was a few seconds, but come in, listen.
Chuck said Grimes is his best friend.
we can use both of them to our advantage.
what do you want me to do about the others?
I think we need to be conservative here, terminate the rest
they're gonna fire the entire store, except you and Morgan.
I just got this job back.
where is Morgan?
clever, putting a CIA base under an electronics store.
every piece of intelligence Shaw has on the Ring is in here.
NWe'll be putting a dagger through the heart of the CIA's operation by taking it out.
all right, Neil, you're on.
cut off any and all communications coming in and out of the store.
break into the mainframe, find and destroy everything they have on us.
then blow this base sky high.
be a pleasure.
the phone works remotely.
it was a set-up; they've lured us here.
why would they lure us here?
it's not where they lured us to, it's where they lured us from.
the Ring knows I'm alive, which means they know I'll have a base of operations somewhere.
they sent us here so I'd abandon my base.
that way they can go and recover all the intelligence we have on them.
they weren't after Devon.
they're after Castle.
Chuck's in there, and he's not flashing.
he's a sitting duck. Go!
Hey, Morgan, we need to talk. Chuck, we gotta talk, listen.
me first okay, trust me, whatever you're gonna say is nothing compared to what I got.
hmm? Okay.
fine, yeah, please, shoot. Okay, uh...
dude, there's a secret underground CIA base under our Buy More.
I... Hey, listen, I know it sounds crazy, but you have to believe me here, okay?
these people who are claiming to buy the store, they're bad guys, okay?
and they call themselves the Ring.
but trust me, these guys are not to be messed with.
how do you, how do you, how do you know all this, Morgan?
okay, I was hiding. I was hiding in there, and I saw them enter the base through an entrance behind our lockers.
so, I followed them.
I heard and saw everything.
Hey, whoa, whoa, dude, listen, I know this is a lot for you to handle, but you gotta stay with me, you gotta pull together.
cause we are now in real danger here, okay?
don't freak out.
Chuck's not answering his cell.
buy More land line's down. I can't get through either.
I think we should call the police.
that's a great idea.
that is a great idea, man.
what...
Wha... Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I don't, I don't, I don't have a signal.
right, right.
bad guys probably cut off all communication to the store.
it makes sense. You know what?
by the time the cops got here it'd be too late, anyway.
we need to handle this now.
no, no, no, no, Morgan.
we don't need to do anything, except get everyone out of the store.
Charles Irving Bartowski, listen to yourself!
these men are trying to blow up a CIA base under our store.
okay, we are Buy More's
america's last line of defense.
and we are going to take the fight to them.
Morgan, listen to yourself right now.
this is not a video game.
this is real life.
people get hurt.
there is no restart from last checkpoint.
I understand that you're scared, okay?
and that not everybody has the stomach to be a hero.
so I'll just go see if Jeff and Lester want to help,
okay, look, fine, fine, fine.
I will help you on one condition.
we get everyone else out of the store first, and what you've told me remains a secret between the two of us.
Yes, yes.
you know what?
no need to put everyone else at risk.
we will handle this, okay?
and this secret is locked down.
what's going on?
we're locking down the store, Charles.
we're refusing to leave until they give us our jobs back.
no, gu-guys, that is a very...
please, don't - don't do that.
don't put that there. Don't, do... Stop! Stop!
stop putting things down.
look, locking down the store is a very, very, very bad idea.
you two want to turn tail and run, fine.
I'm staying here and fighting for my job.
Mike, gentlemen, assorted ladies, taking over the Buy More is not only illegal, but it's very dangerous, trust me.
the only thing dangerous is if they try to fire us.
they're going to have to do it over dead bodies.
these corporate fat cats think they can take whatever they want.
they can take our dignity, they can take all the hot women, but they will not take our jobs!
and they will never take our store!
buy More!
Sarah, Shaw, Casey, can you hear me?
you have to... your frequency.
can you hear me?
Yeah, I can hear you. What's going on?
Oh, thank God. Thank God.
listen, listen, listen.
the Ring is inside Castle, guys.
they came in posing as buyers trying to purchase the store.
we're on our way back. Sit tight.
this is for you. Mace. I know it's not much, but it'll have to do.
Emmett kept a stockpile in case the Russians attacked Red Dawn style.
this is for you also. Walkie-talkie. Don't drop it. It's expensive.
you ready to do this? Let's do this. No, no, no, no, no, Morgan.
listen, on second thought, I-I-I don't think we should do this.
no, maybe you're right. Let's get out of here.
right? Maybe get a little burger or something...
are you kidding me, Chuck?!
men are trying to blow up a CIA base here, okay?
time is running out. Time to step up.
no, no.
Morgan, you don't want to do this, okay?
trust me, you don't understand.
you don't understand, Chuck. I've been a loser my whole entire life and I'm done with that, okay? Time for me to be a hero.
you're all alone, Agent Carmichael.
I've locked down the base.
sir, who's Agent Carmichael?
okay? You're crazy.
this guy is crazy, Chuck. Thinks you're a spy.
Yeah, yeah, th-that's ridiculous, thinking I'm a spy.
ridiculous, sir.
okay, listen to me, we work at the Buy More, all right?
and if you just - if you let us go,
I promise we're not going to tell anyone what you're doing here.
tell him, Chuck.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, n-not a word.
that is a really sharp looking razor.
we've searched the base's main frame.
Shaw's files aren't there.
we know that he's hiding them here.
tell us where they are, Agent Carmichael.
trust me - the alternative is extremely unpleasant.
you know, I don't think there's any need for torture right now, because even if I was a spy, which I'm not
I'm not saying that I am a spy - but even if I was a spy, my training would have taught me to withstand said torture.
so I don't really think it's going to have any kind of effect at this particular juncture, right?
that's why I'm going to torture him.
you made the mistake of telling us the bearded fella's your best friend.
for the last time
where are the files, Agent Carmichael?
guys, guys, please, please, please just listen to me.
this is ridiculous, okay?
I have known this man my entire life, all right?
Chuck Bartowski has been my best friend- my brother since we were six.
Chuck Bartowski is not a spy.
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck, please!
tell him something! Tell him the truth! Chuck!
I'm really scared here! Chuck!
wait, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop! Chuck!
stop, stop.
Morgan, the-the truth is...
the truth is... I am a member
I have a level six clearance, and my code name is Charles Carmichael.
I'm a spy, buddy.
Sarah, anything?
we're locked out. They overwrote our security access.
I'm locked out here.
Casey's checking the Buy More.
cease fire, cease fire.
hold your - hold your fire.
unlock the door.
what the hell is going on in here?
the store's being bought.
they're canning everybody except Bartowski and Grimes.
we're staging a revolution to take down the Man.
I want in.
how do we know that we can trust you, son?
that you're not some kind of spy for the Man?
because the only thing I hate more than hippie neo-liberal fascists and anarchists are the hypocrite fat-cat suits they eventually grow up to become.
Yep, that works for me. Good-good-good point.
nice to chat.
welcome aboard, my brother.
you're a spy?
you remember what I just said about freaking out?
I think you're doing that right now, and-and-and you shouldn't do that.
you're a spy? Stay with me, buddy, okay?
you two can kiss and make up later.
where are Shaw's files?
now, Chuck!
we've got visitors.
Colonel Casey and Agent Walker decided to join the party.
Casey and Sarah are spies, too?
you have a lot of catching up to do.
excuse me while I take care of your friends.
we'll save the torture for later.
no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't - I can't believe it.
all this time, you kept this a secret?
from me?
I'm so sorry, Morgan.
you have no idea how badly I've wanted to tell you.
all this lying about where I've been.
you know, making plans and breaking them.
and-and all the time, all I've wanted to do is tell you all about it, but I had to protect you, too, you know?
please understand that.
I don't...
my best friend is a spy?!
this is unbelievable!
this is the best news I've ever heard!
why we stopped hanging out and talking.
I thought I lost you, buddy. I thought I lost you.
but you were out saving the world?
Chuck, you are officially rehired as my best friend.
great. That's good news. Thanks.
Oh, I have so many questions.
I mean, wh-wh-where do I start?
uh, how did this happen?
did they recruit you at the Buy More? Stanford?
Chuck? Yeah, I'm pretty sure we're going to die here, Chuck, so no time for secrets.
you know what, you're right, buddy.
you're right. And-and quite frankly, you deserve to know.
so here goes - you ready?
Yeah. Yeah, man.
okay.
this all started about two and a half years ago when I got an e-mail from Bryce Larkin...
what the hell is that noise?
the Buy More employees have staged a revolution.
so that's the sound of liberty? Mm-hmm.
good news, bad news.
the good news - we found what we were looking for.
I've uploaded it to headquarters.
the bad news, Colonel Casey's arrived at the Buy More.
could be a problem.
not if he's dead. Kill him.
peace out, man.
Hey, brother Casey, make love not war.
you want a hit?
Hey, man, that's not cool.
fight the power.
Yeah. Peace out.
crap!
castle has a self-destruct program built into it in case of catastrophic events like this.
I'm calling Langley to activate it now.
you can't destroy the Castle. Chuck is down there.
so is every piece of intelligence we have.
not just on the Ring - everything.
please, just give Chuck five more minutes, okay?
for me.
I'm sorry, Sarah, but you can't think of Chuck.
you have to think like a spy.
I am thinking like a spy. Chuck is a member of my team, and he has served this country well, and for all that he has done, the least we can do is just give him five more minutes.
so, that's it.
that's how it happened.
so, now I got this thing in my brain the Intersect, like I told you you know, and... and it's not working.
uh, yeah, yeah.
just one more.
um, so if Sarah is your handler, does that make her your beard?
in other words, like, is your whole relationship a fake?
cause, oh, buddy, that's... that's just awful.
Why? Because we never had sex?
no, I just feel like, you know, having to be...
you never had sex with that girl?
that's not... no, no.
it's... it's awful that you had to pretend to be in a relationship with somebody that you clearly love.
Sarah and I are over, you know.
no, you're not.
you're a good liar, Chuck, but you're not that good.
all right, you lied to me for three years, but I always knew you loved that girl.
I mean,
I saw the way you looked at her.
we all did.
it's okay.
you don't have to deny it.
tell me you don't love Sarah.
you know what, you're right, buddy.
I do love Sarah.
I kept telling myself that I didn't.
that I wouldn't, I couldn't, but I do.
Morgan, you have no idea how badly I needed to get all this off my chest.
thank you.
get rid of them.
kill them. Dump the bodies.
thank me later, buddy.
we're about to die.
no, you're not.
Chuck, sword!
Thanks, buddy.
mine's bigger than yours.
that's my best friend!
Yeah, he's out. He's out.
I couldn't get in.
we're locked out.
time's up.
man This is Langley Control.
bag 'em and tag 'em, Sarah.
agent Walker.
we'll just have to put Grimes in witness protection.
move him out of Burbank tonight after dark.
what? Wait, wait, wait.
no, no, no. Hang... hang on a second.
morgan is not going anywhere, okay?
Chuck, he knows your secret.
Yeah, well, so do a lot of people.
awesome knows, and we didn't put him underground.
Yeah, because Awesome's awesome.
Grimes is a moron.
it's just too dangerous.
we have no reason to believe that we can trust him. Yes, we do.
we have 22 reasons why we can trust him.
that's the number of years that Morgan has been my best friend.
and, yes, he has his faults- granted but one thing he is is loyal, and he will never betray me .
he's right.
thank you.
look, I'm flashing.
I'm a spy again because I have my best friend back.
you need the Intersect, and I need him, so Morgan Grimes is staying exactly where he belongs, which is the Burbank Buy More.
Hey. Hey, buddy.
Hey. Sorry about the wait.
no, no problem, no prob...
Casey.
I should've known you had a big secret.
God help us.
so, yeah, everything's okay.
that's great. Yes! I love to hear it.
okay, so am I, uh, like, officially part of the team or...
let's um...
let-let's walk before we run, huh, buddy?
and maybe crawl before that.
Yeah, yeah. You know what, we should celebrate.
okay, little old-school game night-Duck Hunt, Subway meatball marinaras with extra jalapeos.
that's how you like it.
and, uh, just the two of us.
Yeah, just the two of us.
buy More.
Yes, hello.
this is Craig Rogers from Buy More corporate.
I heard what happened down there today.
interesting display you put on there.
you-you calling to fire us or arrest us?
neither.
I'm calling to hire you. Huh?
yesterday, I was planning on selling this store.
but I spoke to the potential buyers, and from what I've heard, your store showed the most incredible display of store loyalty I've ever seen.
the store is no longer for sale.
victory!
no, I'm not kidding you.
when was the last time you beat me at Duck Hunt?
I am the old-school master. I...
what are you...? I want you to tell me - when was the last time that you beat me at Duck Hunt? That's... that's incredible.
uh, hey, keep these, uh, meatball subs warm for me, would you, buddy?
I'll be right in.
um, I talked to Shaw, and I heard what happened.
the Ring used me as a decoy. You said I was safe, bro.
and you are.
you... you will be, okay?
we are doing everything that we can to make sure that you and Ellie are protected and safe.
okay?
okay.
are you okay? You've been a nervous wreck ever since this morning.
babe, we need to get away.
we just got away.
I'm talking about really getting away.
you know, just you and me.
okay. Where do you want to go?
further.
Hawaii?
no, no. Further.
I'm talking about...
africa.
Africa?
we can join Doctors Without Borders.
doctors Without Borders? Honey, you didn't want to go to France.
this is different, hon.
I am talking about you and me traveling the world. What do you say?
I don't know what to say.
say yes.
this is crazy. We can't just up and leave.
what about Chuck? I'm the only family that he has.
but this isn't about Chuck.
no, this is about you and me.
our family.
come on, babe.
so, now that the Ring knows about the Castle, does that mean we have to shut down the operation?
the Ring shut down all communications.
they never had a chance to let their superiors know about their discovery.
that'll buy us the time we need to put together a full offensive, take them down once and for all.
so then, what's wrong?
the Ring had me dead to rights today in Malibu.
so why didn't they kill me?
so, Sarah and Casey - they're really spies, huh?
Yeah, yeah. They're great.
are you kidding me?
that is ridiculous, dude. Look at that shooting.
are...
you did your flash thingy on it.
you flashed on Duck Hunt.
Hello?
man Hello, Colonel Casey.
it's been a while.
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here's a few things you might need to know.
you're not the same guy that I fell for.
how am I not the same guy?
you killed somebody, Chuck.
he didn't kill the mole.
what?
I did.
it's time you learned the truth about your wife's murder.
No!
if the Ring played him this video...
Oh, my God, General, where is Sarah now?
I believe she's with Agent Shaw.
Daniel, where are you taking us?
to settle an old score.
okay, just give me 20 seconds.
are you sure about this?
NSA picked up the Director's signal.
this is his broadcast point.
if they're right, Sarah, the Ring's most senior operative is behind that door.
cover me.
Hey, buddy.
Hey. Hey, hey, buddy. Where's Casey? Haven't seen him.
I have been thinking about this whole unofficial member of Operation Bartowski and I'd like to make it official.
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of in the middle of something...
Spyish? I know. That's my point, dude.
let me help.
I want to be part of the team. Okay, fine. Help me find Casey and you're part of the team.
operation Bartowski? I could actually...
not so loud. - Not so loud, right.
it's just great news, you know, because, listen,
I could be your second in command slash personal assistant.
Batman needs Alfred. Bond needs Q. Chuck...
Hey, hey, hey. You need me.
Morgan, I need Casey right now.
well, Chuck, per my excellent peripheral vision ，which is a valuable spy skill I might add...
I can tell you that one John Casey is now exiting the restroom.
Oh, thank you. Great.
you're welcome. So I'm a spy? That's it? Official?
Yes, you're a spy. Gotta go.
I am a spy.
Walker killed Shaw's wife?
it was five years ago. It was her Red Test. Sarah didn't know.
Beckman didn't know, but Shaw, he knows.
now, he and Sarah have disappeared on some mission.
they're off the grid. They can't be raised. They're gone.
Chuck, I'm not an agent. You shouldn't be telling me any of this.
but you know what to do, Casey.
okay, Beckman told me to just sit tight.
you and I know I can't do that.
Sarah just activated her locator. She's in trouble.
come on, man! You know how I feel about her.
call this number. Request Tactical Support.
you'll be forwarded to a Colonel Sanders.
don't make fun of his name. You want air, armor... everything.
... video camera for your birthday.
I had no idea you were going to use my present against me.
happy birthday.
I love you.
Oh, my God.
I love you.
all right, one more time, just so we're clear.
we have to reacquire Agent Walker.
do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
this is Team Leader. Is everything set?
men Air is go. Mechanized is go.
tactical is go. Airborne is go.
all right, boys, let's do this.
I'm going first.
Shaw. What is going on?
what is this? This is my Red Test.
why would they have my surveillance footage from my first kill?
just take a breath.
this is the worst moment of my life up there on that monitor.
I love you.
mine, too. - What?
Why? Who is she?
I killed your wife?
you had no idea that the Ring was behind this.
Shaw, I killed your wife. - This isn't your fault.
I thought I was a good spy.
this isn't your fault.
hey... it's okay.
go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
move! Move! Move!
the perimeter's surrounded.
man What's happening in there? Target's secure?
this is Team Leader. Cancel air support. Cancel tactical.
and the tank, the tank! Cancel the tank.
who on Earth gave you the authority to call in a full tactical assault?
I don't know what to do with you, but I know you're not ready.
but, General, it was Sarah.
come on. I had to...
you want to see the bill for your rescue mission?
it's longer than my copy of Atlas Shrugged.
look, you and I both thought the worst.
that Shaw had gone rogue. That he was going to...Kill Sarah?
Shaw. Sarah. Listen...
you thought I betrayed my country?
general, Chuck's actions were those of a true spy.
he was looking out for his partner and the Agency.
I would have done the same myself.
maybe without the stealth bombers, but perhaps that's just me.
are you doing okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.
thank you for saving me.
I appreciated the tank.
general, did you check Sarah's records?
any clues as to who ordered her Red Test?
I'm afraid, Sarah, Langston Graham took that secret to his grave.
well, okay, General, then what are we supposed to do now?
we disband the team.
surely, you can't operate as an effective unit with this history.
general, if I may?
this isn't the first time they've used one of our own against us.
I want to make sure it's the last.
you're saying you can still work with Walker?
I can. We both want the same thing:
to capture the Director and take down the Ring.
are you with me?
can we still be a team?
Yes.
great.
everyone's back together again.
what is it, boy? My demo station don't cook by itself.
I, uh...
spit it out, son.
is it your mama?
it's Chuck.
is he okay?
Jeff and Lester, I could give a damn about them.
go ahead and fire them.
it's okay.
someone else? Who's the issue?
me. Me. I'm the issue.
this is tough. I'm quitting.
I found a job. A real job.
you can feel proud about it?
you're not selling your body?
you've got to go.
boy... I...
I can't show emotions like this.
those animals out there, they'll...
they'll get me if I do.
I think Morgan's dying.
I call dibs on his locker.
its location is far more prestigious than my own.
no, man. Those are tears of joy.
Morgan's leaving.
don't worry, John.
you will always have us.
and now, sans Morgan, we have room!
for what? - For you.
in our crew, buddy.
come on. Hands in!
you, you can let go of my hand now.
what is it, Bartowski?
general, if I could speak freely?
that's not a good idea.
as the titular member of Team Bartowski,
I think that it's crazy to be putting Shaw back in the field so soon.
he just found out that Sarah killed his wife, okay?
nobody can control their feelings that well.
Chuck, what you are seeing in Shaw is an absolute professional:
something you are not.
that's why I'm moving them out of Burbank.
moving who out of Burbank?
Sarah and Shaw.
I'm proceeding with my original plan.
they'll head up our Ring task force in Washington.
and what about me?
you'll stay in Burbank until I know what to do with you.
where you going, sport? New job?
it's kind of secret.
you're going to work for Chuck.
I'm not a moron.
all right. Isn't it awesome?
can you believe it? Me, a spy.
and listen, when General Beckman lets you come back, me and you will be spies together.
Beckman doesn't forget a small thing like "treason."
I'm really learning to enjoy my new life here.
are you kidding me?
John, your old life was so exciting.
the adventures, the missions, the weaponry, the women...
please stop. - Right. Got it.
learn to lock it down.
well, I'll tell you what.
I'm glad you're okay here, you know?
won't be the same without you. But, uh...enjoy my old life.
you, too.
got some very exciting news. Are you ready? Hold onto your hat. I did it.
I...
what the heck is going on here?
are you mixing gaming with whiskey?
she's leaving, man.
leaving with the other guy.
no, this cannot happen. This cannot happen.
I thought I stood a chance, you know?
Yeah, well, just...
okay, okay, buddy. Hand it over.
no. Let go. No.
you are on the precipice of emotional ruin here.
I'm already over the edge! - No, you're not!
soon you're gonna start quoting liberally from the works of John Hughes.
and then things are gonna go dark.
things are gonna go really dark, and I'm not gonna let that happen.
Morgan, hand over the bottle! - Never!
Yes, you will. - Make me.
I hope you're happy.
she said she couldn't be with someone who didn't believe in her.
well, I believed in her.
I just didn't believe in me.
dude, you are misquoting the line, and you are ruining Pretty in Pink for me. Now, just stop it.
put the cap back on the top of the bottle, and let's forget that this night ever happened. Okay?
I'm really good at that, dude. I've forgotten entire years, man.
what is happening?
Hey, Sarah. Chuck's in a, a bit of a low spot.
Yeah, yeah, I see that.
he found out that you're leaving with Shaw.
he's also eaten an entire carton of sugar-free mint ice cream, which is only concerning, well, when you factor in the large consumption of whiskey.
thank you.
Morgan, can you leave us please?
I forgive you.
great, now I hate this song.
look, I,uh...
I know what I look like.
the mint ice cream sobered me up pretty good.
Chuck, it's okay.
no, it isn't.
I thought I could save you.
I thought Shaw was bad and I was gonna save you, and we were gonna be together.
but that didn't happen.
Shaw's a good spy.
I get it, okay? I think everybody gets it. Shaw is amazing.
and you two are gonna go run off together and save the world.
and that's great news for the world.
but earlier in my drunken haze...
I realized that I hadn't asked you a question.
really important question that I'd like to ask you now, if that's okay.
just once, for the record...
Sarah, do you love me?
I'm, uh, I'm in my underwear.
I'm sitting in my underwear, holding a plastic guitar.
Yes. - I should probably put some pants on.
no, Chuck.
Yes.
Wh... uh, what?
Chuck, I fell for you a long, long time ago...
so, yes. Yes.
wait, wait.
what about my Red Test?
Casey told me.
he told me that he killed the mole and that you couldn't do it.
and it was the best news that I'd ever heard because it means that you haven't changed.
you're still Chuck.
you're still my Chuck.
I, uh, I will be totally cleaned up by tomorrow.
well, you don't have time because we have a mission.
Shaw found the Ring headquarters.
it's a three-man op, and you're our third.
mission?
no problem.
Morgan, what are you doing?
right. Where are my manners?
we haven't even met professionally.
morgan Grimes.
agent of the CIA and an assistant to one Charles Irving Bartowski.
now, let's get to work here. You heard the lady.
there is a mission, and you are needed.
let's get you some coffee.
you okay, Chuck? - Huh, what, me? Yeah, good. Totally cool.
all right.
director has his own private elevator.
you two are gonna rappel down to it.
when the Director leaves, grab him; I'll pull you back up.
cool. Great.
you think he knows about us?
I'm just saying...
okay, ready?
don't worry about the warehouse or Beckman, Chuck.
I trust you completely.
Yeah.
okay, Shaw, we're in.
what's the matter?
um, I have a concern about Shaw.
while he, yes, is a very great spy, emotionally, the guy is Swiss cheese, okay?
Chuck, Shaw is one step closer to capturing the Director.
and I'm sure that is all he is thinking about, so don't even worry.
all right, Sarah, I'm accessing the elevator's controls.
gentlemen.
he's having a mental break. We're fish in a barrel.
sorry about that, guys. Little Ring company.
see, I told you he wasn't trying to kill us.
all right. I'm opening the hatch.
Oh, don't worry. It's a tranq gun.
okay, fine. Just sell that it's real.
right, of course. Ruthless spy.
you're gonna take care of most of them though, right?
Sarah, internal security system is detecting something moving toward the elevator.
looks like the Director's coming in early.
time to meet our bad guy.
one word and you're dead.
now, this is brazen.
that... that was four words.
kidnapping me in my own lift. Impressive.
but there's absolutely no chance you'll get the Cipher.
did he just say Cipher? - Yeah.
what do you mean? - Don't play dumb. You're better than that.
we've been building our own Intersect for a year. You know that.
of course. The Cipher is the Intersect's core processor.
fine, so it's here. So where exactly is it?
you won't get five feet from this door.
my security will be on you in seconds.
well, that's tough because either we get the Cipher or...
pull out your Ring phone.
what Ring phone?
you mean, this Ring phone?
Yeah, that Ring phone right there. Call your assistant.
what? - You know, your secretary. Whoever you have.
call him or her, have them bring the Cipher to you here.
and put it on speakerphone.
you give her one warning, and I'm gonna...
please. I know the drill.
sir, you asked for this.
also, I spoke with Operative 6. They'll proceed with the coup in 15 minutes.
the Spanish Ambassador also called back with the ransom offer.
he wants to close by end of day tomorrow at the latest.
thank you, Denise.
and please text me when the plane lands in Barcelona.
"Barcelona..." it's a code.
Oh,"Barcelona's" a code? That - that's good.
what are we supposed to do with her now?!
well, personally, I'd shoot her.
decisions, decisions.
Shaw, what's going on?
just need a few more seconds.
well, we don't have seconds.
sorry, sir. One of our guys heard something strange in the elevator shaft.
Hi, welcome to the party. This is getting ridiculous.
I've got it. Here we go.
you know it's over, right?
what?
this was a trap.
for you.
okay, nobody move. We can all die here today.
you can all die here today.
personally, I have dinner reservations.
look at me.
do I look like an amateur?
no, you don't, but your partner here is a very different story.
not much of a spy, are you?
I am a spy.
Really? With a tranq pistol?
real gun too dangerous for you?
put it down.
sorry, Chuck.
Daniel... still upset about your wife?
you should really learn to get over that or take it out on Agent Walker here.
she pulled the trigger.
go. Take the service elevator to the fifth floor, then the north stairwell.
I'll get the Cipher. I'll meet you back at Castle.
Shaw, we're not gonna leave you here.
Sarah, go, please.
did he...?
you know, I think you're right.
good work, Daniel.
I think they bought it.
of course they did.
you weren't supposed to eliminate the Director, Shaw.
this wasn't a red op.
I did what I had to to get my team out.
that was a huge kick!
where did we...? Where'd you get this? Where'd we get this footage?
I tapped into the building security feed during the op.
wow, that's a hell of a roundhouse, buddy.
uh, General, I do think it's worth noting that we would all be dead if it were not for Shaw, so...
very well.
general, there's also the issue of the Cipher.
the Director said that the Ring was making a new Intersect.
relax. My team analyzed their Cipher and found a number of problems in the design.
obviously, the Ring isn't as far along as they thought.
looks like the Cipher's components were fabricated in France.
that's right, Shaw. I need you and Sarah to follow this trail to Paris.
we believe the Ring's design facility is there.
we can be in the air in 30 minutes.
excuse me, General.
uh, what, what about me?
sorry, Chuck, you're not ready.
we are never gonna get our chance, are we?
once I get back, it's all gonna happen...
you and me.
don't worry. Just one more mission.
Hey, look at you! Nice!
I take it you and Sarah are official.
now, the other guy, he's out of the way?
well, actually, Sarah and Shaw are on their way to Paris.
Beckman doesn't think I'm ready to be out in the field.
but other than that, everything's fine.
how is everything fine?
Chuck, I quit my job so I could join you in the field.
you did... you did what?!
you said I was a part your team.
that you were gonna speak to Beckman about me.
did you speak to Beckman about me?
of course you didn't. No, why would you?
I'm not a spy. I'm an idiot.
no, no, you're not an idiot.
I gave up a management position in a down economy.
Chuck, are you kidding me? None of that is gonna happen.
listen to me. Shaw's gonna get Sarah, okay?
and you're gonna go willy-nilly, tie me up again and drink yourself into Guitar Hero oblivion.
I may have said some unfortunate things about Shaw, but the fact of the matter is the guy's exactly what he seems: he's a hero.
that's nice. Good for him.
a stud, okay? And 99 times out of ten, that guy gets the girl.
we're done here!
buddy, Morgan, Morgan, look, I'm not supposed to show you this, but it was so awesome, I made a copy of it.
it'll help prove my point.
here we go.
okay, this is from the mission.
that is Shaw saving our butts right there.
wait for it. Wait for the roundhouse.
that's gotta hurt.
we have a problem. - What?
Chuck, look at this.
and that roundhouse? It doesn't even land.
but he shot people, Morgan! Bad people!
did you see blood, viscera, brain matter?
Chuck, did you see brain matter?
okay, listen to me.
I have seen every Hong Kong fight film ever made, all right?
I direct your attention to my favorite Sonny Chiba poster.
I am the man when it comes to this. You have to trust me.
I can spot a fake action sequence from a mile away.
but if the fight was staged, that means that Shaw is working with the Ring.
and Sarah is with him.
I'm uploading the fight footage to Beckman's home computer now.
report, Chuck.
uh, General, I'm so sorry about the hour, but we just figured something out. Something very important.
agent Shaw is working with the Ring.
Chuck, how many times do we have to do this?
general, before, I was right for the wrong reasons, but this time I'm right for the right reasons, and-and I have proof.
Hi, there.
what is he doing here?!
well, uh, first of all, sir, uh, ma'am... Is it "sir"? What am I doing?
just talk! - Okay.
I'd like to thank you for this opportunity.
stop! What are you doing there?!
me? I'm with him. I'm on Chuck's team.
Oh, no. No, you're not because Chuck's not on his own team anymore.
I want you both out of Castle in five minutes!
Chuck, you are suspended!
No! No, no, General!
come on! She's blocking my call.
well, okay, my time as a spy was pretty exciting.
a bit brief, you know?
you're still a spy. - How's that, dude?
because right now I need a team, and you're all I've got, buddy, okay?
CIA or no CIA. We need to save Sarah.
just the two of us.
no, there is another.
so now they're in Paris, Sarah and Shaw.
and Shaw, this time for real, he is working for the Ring.
now, I know that you can't help me again.
I know all that.
but Sarah's gonna die without us.
I can't do this alone.
and I can't help you anymore. I'm not a spy.
but you are a spy! You're the ultimate spy!
was, Chuck, was.
but the man's been Buy More'd. - That's right.
you deluded yourself into thinking that Buy More's your life.
but wake up, John, okay?
cause we need you to get on this plane!
Chuck needs you to get on this plane.
I know this because I was that guy.
but Chuck and Sarah and you, Casey,
what about you?
Morgan, go to my closet and get me my suit.
the black one?
is this all of it?
this is everything I could find on Shaw.
I can't believe this is happening. She could be dead, Casey.
focus on the mission, will ya?
Windsor night
what is it? You just flashed.
it's a mission from ten years ago. It has nothing to do with Sarah.
I could flash on everything in here, and we'd still be at square one and have nothing.
I'm stuck in the air right now and there's nothing I can do about it!
Chuck, focus.
forget about the Intersect. Forget about being a spy.
it's what you have to do.
where are you, Sarah?
something is off.
what is it?
why did you bring me here?
what do you mean?
you led me here.
come on. This is where I shot her. Is this some kind of a trap?
Sarah... you killed my wife.
did you really think that I'd be okay with that?
but you said that...
I told you a lot of things to get you here.
the gun's getting heavy, isn't it?
you know, you could hurt someone with this.
there's a little cafe around the corner.
let's sit down, discuss the details.
just relax. It's all over now.
the drug is a special toxin.
it won't kill you. It simply immobilizes your nervous system.
I want you to see what's gonna happen next.
I need you to understand why I'm doing this.
so, Sarah, I see you've met my newest Ring agent.
Why?
well, I offered Daniel the chance to not only avenge his wife's death,
the CIA believed that Eve had been turned by us.
your boss Langston Graham assigned you to kill her.
you did what you were told.
I'm going to send a message to the CIA that they betrayed the wrong man.
very well put, Daniel.
they need to know what they did to me.
they need to feel the pain that I felt.
and that... is why I have to kill you.
on that note, do you have it with you?
the technical data should help your scientists complete the new Intersect.
thank you, Daniel. We'll be in touch.
do you need us to, uh...?
no.
I want to show her the river.
it's... beautiful at night.
well, good night, then.
good-bye, Sarah.
almost time to go.
how'd you find me?
I've read your file...
your wife's, every mission you've been on, every paper you wrote at West Point, every travel report.
you come here once a year in memory of your wife's death.
it made morbid sense that you'd want Sarah to see it, too.
smart. Very smart.
you're under arrest. Now, stand up.
less smart, Chuck.
you should pull the trigger.
now. Kill me.
I wouldn't do that.
I see you brought Casey.
Oh, yes, I did...
and he's currently taking care of your new Director.
and you've got me?
stand... up.
I guess the gun was his idea.
good.
no, Shaw, don't do this.
you can't flash, can you?
those emotions get you into trouble.
now, you just stay here. I don't want to hurt you.
none of this was your fault.
I haven't told them your secret.
but if you follow me...
I will kill you.
the drug will dull the pain.
you won't feel a thing.
stop!
I warned you.
please...
it doesn't have to be like this.
this isn't you, Shaw.
you can't do this.
happy birthday.
I love you.
no, Chuck, I can. You can't.
we've been over this.
you no longer work for me, John.
unless there's a sale at the Buy More, we have nothing to talk about.
then I guess you don't want to talk about...
my little friend here, hmm?
the Ring Director.
what do you want for him?
well... full reinstatement, my old rank back, and a new Crown Victoria...
and a request you're probably not gonna like.
it - it seemed like a good job, but I just...
couldn't cut it.
what I came here to ask of you is...
can I come back to the store, sir?
maybe? Just...
I'll see my way out.
not yet.
I couldn't bear to put the offer out there.
it's been here waiting for you.
don't worry, son.
you can always come home.
thanks a lot, Big Mike. - Dad.
Yeah.
Thanks, Big Mike. - Papi.
let's go with "Dad. " Thanks, Dad.
I like that one.
is this Morgan Grimes?
Yeah. Who dis?
this is General Beckman of the NSA.
I am calling to say...
that you are officially a member of Operation Bartowski.
you're not kidding me, are you?
this isn't some sort of...
mean prank or anything, is it?
no. We don't do pranks.
you can thank Colonel Casey.
okay, I got to go quit my job. Hold on a second.
don't do that. Your cover is the Buy More.
right. Right, that's perfect.
that's perfect. I'm good at that.
aye, aye, Captain.
general. It's General.
of course. General. General.
thank you... thank you, sir. Ma'am.
I will not let you down.
are you... Hello? Hello?
how you feeling?
Oh, what happened?
everything's okay now.
what about Shaw?
he's dead.
I'm sorry.
Oh, my God, we...
there was a... there was a cafe and...
and a bridge, and he tried to kill me, and...
Oh, my God, you shot him.
I couldn't let him hurt you, Sarah.
trust me, I did what I had to do.
but I'm still the same guy.
I'm still Chuck. I promise.
you saved me.
Chuck, Sarah, excellent work.
I've consulted with Colonel Casey, and he brought me up to speed.
I'll expect a full report when you get back to Burbank.
actually, General, I think we're gonna need a few more days in Paris.
no, I want you back ASAP. We have a new mission.
last night a team of Peruvian assassins broke into...
agent Bartowski?
agent Walker?
I've lost contact. Get them back.
I don't... - Then shut up and kiss me.
Hi, I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that you might need to know.
Alejandro Fulgencio Goya, chief military officer of Costa Gravas.
you saved my life.
how can I ever hope to repay you?
gonna be laid up for a while.
well, maybe you could use the time to meet up with Alex, figure out what your role is in her life.
why do you have my daughter's phone number?
I do need to take things... slow.
super slow.
the...
you're not... I - I mean...
No! Oh, no, no.
this... I don't want...
it was here, it was on the... it was on the ground.
of course, with the one knee, you were assume...
but no, not, that's not it.
well, I'm going to go talk to... - I'm gonna go exercise.
so awkward.
in a world filled with awkward Chuck and Sarah moments comes one moment so awkward...
Morgan. - ...that it will have...
Morgan! Please, don't torture me.
Sarah and I haven't spoken one word about what happened, and even though I wasn't proposing,
I'd like to know if thinking I might have been was, you know, good news or horrible news.
she's acting like nothing ever happened.
I get it, I get it.
your woman is a hot mystery
we both know that
but I'm actually more interested in this piece of the puzzle.
now...
would you have been happy if she accidentally said yes to your accidental proposal?
that's what's on the table.
I mean, I didn't think we were there yet, but...
maybe.
well, I tell you what. Before there are any proposals,
I'll tell you what I know.
you both are, without a doubt, crap communicators.
well, I... - No, no, hold on a second.
actual real live day-to-day open communication about your feelings?
I get it.
we could be better communicators, fine.
so what now?
a self-help book?
no.
this isn't just any self-help book.
this is Dr. Fred's 101 Conversations Before "I Do."
Yeah, but I can't bring Sarah a book about getting to "I do."
we just had a talk about how she needs to take it slow, buddy.
don't show her the book, but use it as a tool to help you guys talk, man.
look, we can communicate without the help of a book, okay?
we're not that bad.
you're great. You're right, I'm sorry, yeah.
I mean, you don't know whether or not you proposed, or if you did, if you're happy about it, or if she said yes or no to what may or may not have been a proposal, or if either of you ever want you to actually ask her for real.
yeah?
Yeah, you don't need no book.
you're fine. You're the perfect couple.
and when you're older,
you and Daddy can work out together.
this is one of Daddy's favorite jams for tri-blasting.
Devon. Yeah.
do you realize that you haven't addressed me in over an hour?
Oh. Sorry, babe.
Hey, I gotta talk to Mommy for a minute, okay?
Hello, beautiful.
hello.
we need to talk.
I am, uh, feeling a little over-babied.
I'm not even four months pregnant, and it's all we talk about.
my hot husband suddenly drives a minivan.
Yeah, an awesome minivan.
toyota Sienna, safest family auto in its class.
I'm just saying that maybe we could...
maybe we could get away, go somewhere, like...
let's take a babymoon.
Oh, babe, I'd love to.
but colleges can cost over $300, 000 grand by 2028.
we gotta prioritize.
the baby's not even here yet.
can't we just spend these last few months as just us?
you need a break from babyland.
Yes. - I am with you, honey.
we'll talk later, huh?
good evening, team.
comandante Juan Pablo Turrini.
most trusted advisor to Costa Gravan Premier Alejandro Goya.
Ah! The Generalissimo.
Casey, you're supposed to in bed recovering.
getting some fresh air.
in an underground bunker.
so what's with Turrini?
I ran into him a couple of times when I was trying to kill the Generalissimo.
he's the head of Costa Gravan Secret Police, and he's in town unannounced, which is extremely unusual.
I want everyone who wasn't shot recently to stake out the embassy to see if he turns up.
everyone else should be in bed.
no sign of Costa Gravan activity.
yeah?
what is it, Chuck?
we are crap communicators. - What?
why are we so afraid to talk about the whole ring thing?
you know? I mean, we're in love.
you wear your teeth-bleaching system in front of me.
we should be able to talk, no?
okay. Well, um, let's talk about it.
okay! Okay.
well, first of all, first of all, you know that-that definitely was not a...
proposal, right?
Yes! Yes, uh, totally, of course.
of course. Of course? I mean, it could've been misconstrued.
Morgan- I know- Morgan gave me this book.
this kind of, you know...
it's a silly book, full of silly things, like questions, that you're supposed to ask your partner to help you get talking about the hard to talk about things.
so I was thinking...I don't know, maybe we'll...
should I read it? - No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'll read it.
I'll read it, and I'll ask you the questions, yeah.
and then we can have a series of emotionally stimulating conversations.
or at least that's what the back cover says.
Walker, Bartowski, we have new information.
what is it?
our satellite picked up Turrini's motorcade.
he's not headed to the embassy.
so then, where is he heading?
buenas noches, Dr. Woodcomb.
Costa Gravas calls once more.
what's going on?
Hey, bro. Just in time.
good evening.
I am Comandante Juan Pablo Turrini.
I am here to deliver a personal message from the Generalissimo.
Hola, Devon Woodcomb.
and bride!
I've been so wanting to thank you for saving my life, and I think the best way is just to invite you here to my little bit of Paradise.
Costa Gravas is beautiful at this time of year, as is my private jet that will fly you here.
private jet.
enjoy my beaches, eh?
my jungles!
my palace!
allow me to drench you both, please, in luxury this very weekend.
come... to Costa Gravas!
Devon, babymoon.
babe, it's not safe. We can't go.
come on...
Sarah, is it safe?
well, actually, Costa Gravas is stable right now.
actually, Costa Gravas is very stable.
we have peace now.
and Subway sandwich franchises.
come on. It sounds like the most amazing couple's weekend.
we could go, too, you know.
if it would make you feel safer, Sarah could...
could be there, relaxing, talking...
in a bikini.
you are both more than welcome.
Plus, you will be staying at the palace.
there is no safer or more luxurious place in all the world.
prepare for luxury.
there you go.
snuggles, huh? Okay. Do you need anything else?
I don't need anything.
okay.
that's fine. I understand.
I'll get it. I'll get it.
no, no, no, no. Stay! I will get it.
I'm supposed to be helping you, Casey.
daughter. - Dad.
you're in a wheelchair.
you said that you were just sick.
Oh, just shot in the leg. Fine.
well, I... brought you soup.
I didn't know you were going to be here, Morgan.
how did, uh, how did the pot roast turn out?
uh... great.
Yeah, no, it was perfect.
thank you for the recipe.
you two talk often?
no. No, I wouldn't say often.
once in a blue moon, when we need to discuss meats.
meat.
assorted meats. Potted meat.
Oh, movies! Good, good, good, let's see what we got...
Roman Holiday?
Yeah. Nothing makes me feel better when I'm sick than Princess Audrey.
stop it, this is my sick day movie, too.
come on. Seriously?
okay, Grimes, you're done.
go.
well, I, uh, I better be going, too.
I gotta get back to work.
but I will talk to you later.
that sounds great.
Bye.
Yes. - Grimes?
right. - Give her a five minute lead, hmm?
of course.
okay, which one?
this one or the leopard print?
uh, yes, that, both, all of the above.
okay.
so... you, uh...
you just wanted to go on a vacation?
exactly. Yeah.
you know, because Turrini's not a threat, and Beckman cleared us for a couple days off, and we've been so focused on my mom hunt,
I thought it would be nice if we were just a couple of regular people relaxing on a tropical island.
working on our communication exercises.
that's what you're excited about?
our communication exercises?
well, there are many ways in which to communicate.
like that.
welcome! I'm so glad you've come.
Oh! Oh! Generalissimo!
thanks for having us.
and the bride. Hello.
there's an unmistakable fragrance.
you are with child.
Oh. He's good.
there is nothing sweeter than a ripe fruit, no?
may I introduce my wife.
the light of Costa Gravas.
the woman behind the man,
I apologize if my husband has charmed away any of your women.
come. Tonight we dance.
so, uh, where were we on the conversations?
personal time. - Oh, yes, yes.
morgan is going to need at least five hours of my time every week for Halo purposes.
and I need 30 minutes of complete silence before sleep.
which is gonna be a challenge of my cuddling needs.
okay, how about we do one night cuddle, one night silent thing?
Hey, see, these are useful conversations.
everyone.
please.
I would like to present now a gift to my guest of honor, Dr. Devon Woodcomb.
for your great service to our country.
did you just flash?
huh? No. No, no, no. Not now.
we were just starting to get somewhere.
we were talking, I was gonna have sangria.
there's a...There's a Soviet-era weapons system down that hallway behind a red door.
but we're here for, like, five days, so why don't we just grab it on the way out, after rain forest zip-lining.
Chuck, if it's a threat... - I know, I know.
I know, I know, but my sister's here. I can't be spying around her.
what if something happens?
move into position.
now.
it's okay. We'll just go in, we'll check it out, we'll come back into the party, nobody will know, and nobody will get hurt.
our time is here.
our beautiful Socialist dream has been taken apart by Capitalist swine.
but tonight, our voices will heard.
I'm gonna call Casey about your flash.
he hunted the Generalissimo in this palace for a decade.
he can give us the layout.
okay, okay, well, he, uh, did just get shot in the leg, and is resting up, so he probably won't be available.
Casey. What do you need?
a little bored, Casey?
dear God, please give me something to do.
Hey. I just flashed on some stupid weapons system behind a red door. I think it's down the northeast hallway off the ballroom?
I know that hallway.
when I was hunting the Generalissimo back in my Angel de la Muerte days,
I lived in one of those walls for two weeks.
you know, one of these days we really ought to write down all of these crazy stories of yours.
let me talk to Sarah, and we'll call you back.
we have to figure out how to get past the guards.
we need a diversion.
Oh, shucks!
impossible. Not gonna happen.
I guess we're just gonna have to save the world after the party.
I only do this once a year, but it's such a special occasion, no?
fine, but I'm bringing my drink.
look at the abs on this statue.
I think I've put on a little baby weight.
Hey, no baby talk, remember?
this weekend, we are just husband and wife on a sexy vacation.
how do you feel about taking a tour of some of the darker corners of the palace?
babe, is nine-foot marble me making you a little caliente?
maybe.
way to go, marble me.
okay, Casey, we're down the staircase.
keep heading down the hall.
just follow the stink of commie.
Roger that.
well, in the meantime, let's keep going with the questions, huh?
what are five words you'd use to describe your partner?
start moving everyone into position.
my husband, the pig, and his American friends can roast together.
brunette? Tall?
okay, yeah, good, close, but how about, like, charming, terminally handsome, incredibly intelligent.
uh, this is the door.
here. Hold this.
okay, this is the door.
so, what do you think?
rock and roll.
this may take a few minutes.
Oh, God. Ramming happening right now. What do we do? Any ideas?
Oh, Devon, you're so bad. - How bad am I?
good Lord, get me out of here.
uh, hi, guys. Hey. Chuck, hi.
sorry. Really sorry.
for me mostly.
I know what you two were sneaking off to do.
looks like Costa Gravas makes everyone run a little more caliente.
what was that?
bring me my husband's head!
I want him dead or alive.
so, not the strongest of marriage.
okay, Chuck, I know you're not a spy anymore, but I really need you to do some spy stuff!
dude. They blew my head off.
we have to get the Generalissimo.
Oh, my God.
Chuck, the gun!
sis, you okay?
Yeah, yeah, we're good, man.
that was awesome, Chuck.
good. Great. Let's go.
Casey, get us out of here.
if you can get to the basement, I can get you out.
generalissimo, is there an escape plan?
of course. I'm sorry about all of this.
my wife and I - we've been fighting a lot lately. You know, women...
generalissimo, I once saved your life. I need you to save ours.
of course. Of course. Come. Come. Right this way.
he hid in these very walls for two weeks trying to kill me.
I was in Havana with Castro the whole time.
I heard that.
this way. My plane awaits.
come on, come on, come on.
I cannot believe that there was a coup on my babymoon.
Chuck, thank God that you were there.
you were so amazing, really.
seriously, bro. Thank you.
I just wanted to save the day before Awesome got a chance to.
I am so sorry that I made us go there. It was so stupid of me.
no, it wasn't stupid.
we do need time away.
that's why, when we go home, we're going straight to Malibu.
I hear you, hon.
and this babymoon will happen.
just look at them, Sarah.
they're like communication all-stars.
that's all great, but we have a homeless dictator on our hands.
I mean, I knew things had cooled over the years between Hortencia and myself,
we used to finish each other's sentences.
I know, Generalissimo, I know.
the Costa Gravan embassy in Los Angeles is preparing for your arrival.
are you crazy?
if I cannot trust my wife now, how am I supposed to trust my embassy?
uh, we can try to arrange a CIA safe house with some guards for the time being.
no, I know where I will go now.
there is only one person to whom I trust my life now.
So...roomies.
the wheelchair is not as intimidating as I would hope, but...
your casa is my casa, huh?
what a freaking disaster.
morning, boss. - Morning, Big Mike.
Oh, Big Mike, hey, I could use some advice.
I'm having a little lady trouble.
a son asking his new daddy for love advice. Yeah.
I could well up.
please don't.
here's the thing- I- I met this girl, and there's this wonderful connection,
it's Casey's daughter.
we agree. - Well, son, you have to decide whether this girl is really it or not, because if she is, there is no arm or leg worth as much as the love of a good woman.
the computer is analyzing the photos I took in Costa Gravas.
I'm sorry our vacation didn't work out.
no, hey, whatever.
I mean, we can still keep having conversations anyway.
I mean, we've got, like, 87 more to go, and the next few are about sex.
Chuck, we have a mission.
we don't need to talk about our sex life.
Sarah, there's always going to be a mission, and I think it's important that we make time to talk, even about the awkward stuff.
in fact, you know, if it is the awkward thing,
Dr. Fred suggests talking about the difficult things to your partner while they're sleeping.
I'm not going to talk to you while you're asleep.
this book sounds kind of ridiculous.
okay, so it's not, it's not perfect, but I do think it's helping us talk.
Dr. Fred is world-renowned, after all.
101 Conversations Before "I Do"?
that's the book, the one covered in wedding rings?
Yeah.
I know, I know we did, and we are going to take it slow.
it's just...
you know, someday maybe we could talk about that.
and it takes a long time to have 101 conversations.
why do we always have to talk and push and change things?
why can't we just be?
everything is great.
what if we do "I do," and it changes us?
it's nuclear.
exactly, everything we love about us could be destroyed.
no, not us, the weapon.
it's a nuclear control panel.
the Costa Gravans have nukes.
Costa Gravas is nuclear?!
all right, yes.
I have a nuclear weapons control panel in my basement.
this is such ugliness.
how does it work?
look, it takes two keys, okay, two keys to use the system.
one of them is right here. It's around my neck, see?
you have one key.
where is the other one?
this is so embarrassing, you know?
my wife.
the woman who has just taken over your country?
you have questioned the Generalissimo enough for one night.
he lost his country and his love today.
he must rest.
all right.
Colonel Casey, watch the Generalissimo closely.
we'll speak more in the morning.
Walker and Bartowski, private line.
you two are going back to Costa Gravas.
we can't have a rogue leader with nuclear capabilities.
meet with Colonel Casey about the layout of the palace tonight, and leave first thing in the morning.
Yes, ma'am.
isn't life funny, Colonel Casey?
forgive me
the Angel of Life.
that I would be here and wondering where will I go next?
I got to be honest. This isn't how I thought it'd end up for you.
Why?
well, I wrote a report back in '91
theorizing you'd be taken down by someone else altogether,
someone who could never take his eyes off your wife.
move around behind me, Generalissimo.
do not make me shoot a man in a wheelchair.
better?
generalissimo, you're coming with me.
Hortencia and I need your key.
you're not going anywhere, Generalissimo.
I think you are.
cute.
too bad you didn't bring enough.
I'm sorry, my friend.
no harm comes to him.
you do not kill him, I go with you.
your task is to sneak back into Costa Gravas, destroy the nuclear control room, and find the missiles.
the U. S. wants the Generalissimo back in charge but without nuclear capabilities.
on it, General.
I know every corner of that godforsaken slime hole.
Colonel Casey, are you certain you're up for a mission?
he seems to be pretty determined. - I think he is.
we're almost to the control room.
we'll place the charges around it.
that way, if we have to, we can obliterate the whole thing.
Oh, what is that smell?
that is the stench of tyranny.
Dr. Fred.
wow, big fan, really just a big fan.
listen, I-I met someone recently,
actually, that is the topic of my next book How to Know
40 steps, huh?
Yeah, that's a lot of detail, you know, but I just...
excuse me.
son, are you going to another man for love advice?
have I not made your mama Bolonia sing like the happiest bird in the sky?
probably, sir, sure.
listen, here's the thing-this guy wrote the book on it, literally.
boy, when has anyone ever learned anything important from a book?
I've never, ever heard smooth jams.
I think I've stayed very fit over the years, actually.
shut up, Alejandro, you've ruined seven takes already.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
I just wish I knew why you were so angry with me.
Why?
I have been telling you for years that I was unhappy.
but would you work on it?
would you go see someone with me?
amor, what kind of rebel leader goes to a marriage counselor?
it's ridiculous.
for any who might want to remove the people from office, know that we hold the keys to the most powerful weapon in the world and are not afraid to use force.
you know, darling, maybe you should unbutton one more button.
shut up!
this is exactly the problem.
you have to do everything your way!
we need to act fast right now.
somebody's about to accidentally start World War III.
I say we blow the room, let the Costa Gravans start fresh.
we are more or less in the room.
it's better than an accidental nuking.
you're crazy.
we're all about to die over basically just one big relationship problem?
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No shooting.
excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
I know this is a very private moment.
I just thought maybe you needed a mediator.
grab him!
stop. Stop.
we're here to help.
how did you get back into my country?
who are you people working for?
well, uh, technically, we're with the CIA.
shoot them.
wait, wait, wait. Wait. No, listen.
we are trained to deal with situations just like this, and by the way, you're right about your husband.
totally right.
guards, take them to the barracks.
stop.
what do you mean?
interesting. Um, this is what I mean. This is what I mean.
we heard him undermining you
and you know, getting treated like that for 25 years? Who needs it?!
thank you.
you're welcome. You're welcome.
but, hey, I just call it like I see it.
here's the thing, Hortencia.
you two clearly still care about each other.
you could have killed the Generalissimo at any point, and you haven't done it.
what is happening?! Hortencia, shoot these people!
lead your country.
I bet... I bet, when you started out, just the two of you crazy kids cuddled up in your little tropical cave, dreaming of revolution, and having sweet, sweet jungle love, everything was perfect, no?
but then we moved into the palace, and he changed.
so change ruined things?
but change is unavoidable.
no matter what the changes are, is the love still there?
fine. I'll shoot them.
today I'm Muerte.
FYI, lady, this guy used to watch you sleep.
trust me. I lived in these walls for two weeks.
Chuck, keep talking.
talking, talking, yes!
we were, we were talking about change.
the fact is we were partners...
comrades.
and then he stopped listening to me.
no, I listened.
no, it was different before when it was just us.
uh, that-that, um, that love that you had in the cave?
that doesn't have to change.
would you join me again in leading this country? Will you?
I need you...
just to challenge me, to feed my soul.
we'll get back to who we were, I know it.
my love never died.
and you will give me an official role?
you'll be Secretary of State.
I love it when you talk politics.
baby...
I'm, uh, so glad you're here.
look, I know we've had some flirtation going on, and, uh, I've been a bit tentative.
right?
but I was talking to Dr. Fred,
or just go that route.
Morgan, I like you.
I know that you're freaked out about my dad, but I want to do this.
do you?
Oh, it's not that I... it's not...
just, I just, you know,
I feel like there are steps that people need to take, you know. There are questions that need to be...answered.
an answer, they don't get answered, then there's more.
okay, I'm gonna go.
I don't... I...
Oh, screw it!
we got troops incoming shortly to collect and dismantle the missiles.
and we're almost done in here.
you come, my friends, and join the celebration.
in Costa Gravas, first we revolution, but then we party.
did you purchase this system from Volkoff Industries?
what?
Yeah.
it was part of his underground weapons pipeline.
it was called Project Beacon.
that's what Heather Chandler told us about.
did any of Volkoff's men ever mention a woman, she was CIA, code name "Frost"?
Yeah.
I never met her.
he kept her tucked away back home.
I got a few Costa Gravan angels downstairs, huh, for the man who rescued their country from civil war.
general, do you remember anything else about Volkoff or-or Frost?
I'm gonna give you all my files of my dealings with him.
just remember these are dangerous people, okay?
proceed with caution.
these are people you don't want to find.
Hey, back from the babymoon, huh?
how was it?
it was beautiful.
I, uh, I was thinking about you a lot, actually.
you were pretty good at the spy stuff, weren't you?
I mean...
you just seemed so alive back there.
I don't think I really realized what you were giving up for me.
Ah! I didn't really give up all that much.
Yes, you did, and it must have been difficult.
no secrets.
you know, especially with the baby and you being the only family on my side, anyways.
Ellie, I'm looking for Mom.
what?
Why?
because I think...
I think we should know the whole truth about why she left us.
what story can possibly explain leaving your family?
I don't know. I don't know.
but did you ever think that maybe she had to go for some reason?
like some reason that was beyond her control?
I don't know. I don't know.
but what if there isn't another side to the story?
what if our mother is exactly who we think she is?
well, then we'll find that out, too.
are you awake?
can you hear me, Chuck?
I love you, Chuck.
nothing's ever gonna change that.
and if you ask me for real, then my answer would be yes.
Hi, I'm chunk，that you might need to know.
hello... Diane. Hello, Roan.
what's the deal with this Roan guy? He's a legend in the department.
an incredible spy. Real old-school James Bond type.
Congratulations.
awesome.
Hello, angel.
marrakesh, MOROCCO
I really wish you'd pick up. I need to hear your voice tonight.
I'm sorry, again, that I couldn't make it, but...
I'm thinking of you.
sweet dreams, and besos, my flower.
I'm jealous. Would you like a drink?
I'd like to be that drink.
men must take one look at you and tell you all their secrets.
impress me.
here's one... ah.
the new hundred dollar bill.
impossible to counterfeit, but... Someone did... perfectly.
it's called a super note, and I'm in town to find out who made it.
so you're a spy. Oh... That's very exciting...
Hello, Roan. Naughty... naughty... Roan.
what a way to go.
Ellie, I think she has your mouth...
Oh! I'm out of here.
okay. Here's the sit-rep.
it has been 23 minutes since Clara had a number one, 51 minutes since number two, and 76 minutes since her last feeding. Maybe she's hungry.
or maybe she needs a change. Hey, Sarah, could you get the diapers and wipes?
Chuck, feeding pillow, start!
okay. ELLIE: Mom, can you take her for a minute while I get settled?
Yeah. Go to Grandma. Come to Grandma.
Yeah. That's my girl.
Aw, Grandma's got the magic touch. MARY: Oh...
smooth and silent.
same technique I always used for moving live explosives.
okay, I'll just edit that part out.
babies are stressful. Tell me about it.
you know, speaking of which... Alex...
you know, there's something I want to... tell you...
talk to you about... Hold on! Wow!
it's all good... great. Alex isn't pregnant.
no, no. She just... She wants me to meet her mom.
Oh. Kathleen. Yeah.
Kathleen. You know, and the thing is, I feel kind of uncomfortable starting off this relationship with her with this secret about my friend-slash- not-dead-ex-fiancée.
could you touch base with her, please, and tell her you're actually alive?
not a good idea. Mm-mm.
you know, uh, Alex's having a tough time with this, you know?
she's been lying to her mom this whole time, and, uh, she couldn't even talk to her when you were in a coma.
you see? So...
I'll think about it. Yes! Thank you.
great! Perfect. You're the man! Could you do it kind of quick, though, you know?
because I just... I had this dinner planned on Friday...
so, Chuck, Sarah, what are you guys thinking for the big day?
Oh, it would be so great if Clara could walk down the aisle as your flower girl.
you know, Woodcombs usually walk at six or seven months, so you really don't have to wait that long. What are your colors going to be? Oh...
I'm a better gray than blue, just as a...
I still have my veil, if you want to borrow it.
I don't... I don't know that Sarah's a veil girl.
Oh, my cousin is the raddest vegan caterer. You got to use him.
honey, the wedding cake he made Jim was beige.
well, you know what they - something old, something new, something borrowed, something beige. Wrong.
it's not beige... Wow... family... intense...
I'm actually sweating.
the last time I sweat, there was gunfire involved.
red? Don't use red. Red is black! Blue...
what does that mean? He doesn't even eat cake!
I hear you. We need a bad guy.
so badly.
guys... we need a mission.
sorry to disturb you, General.
No..., not at all.
general, we were just wondering if there was anything that you, or our country, needed, from us.
preferably far outside of America.
actually, I do have a mission, but it would be off the books.
you would have no support, and it's extremely dangerous.
we're in! We're in! In! Then your mission is to rescue and return one of our own:
agent Roan Montgomery.
you mean the seduction - master himself?
I love that guy. What happened? Was he captured?
he was last seen in a café in Marrakech.
general, given Agent Montgomery's...
proclivities, is it possible that he perhaps took an elective trip off the...
no. That is not what happened.
we believe he was investigating local crime czarina Fatima Tazi.
she is best known for her private merc army of female soldiers.
agent Montgomery, luckily, has a tracker on him.
it shows that he is in Fatima's fortress in Marrakech.
locate him, and bring him safely back to the United States.
thank you.
what is going on with the general?!
she's a hot mess!
well, General Beckman and Roan Montgomery have a bit of a history.
their romance has been going on for decades.
historic events happen when those two are together.
berlin '89, Iraq '91...
florida 2000... Which is why we better go get him.
did you ever think your storied life as a spy would come to an end because you picked up a girl in a bar?
well, actually, yes. That's precisely how I thought I'd go.
but that's not what happened.
Oh? Mm-mm. No, I'm in front of the woman who's created the world's only flawless counterfeit bills.
and meeting me was worth dying for?
you're not going to kill me.
you're going to make me your head of distribution.
no, no, no. I'm not joking.
my international contacts can help you launder your money so that people like me don't keep showing up at your door.
and why would I do business with a CIA pig?
because rolling around in the mud can be so much... fun.
what?
you always over-pack for missions.
how am I supposed to know what kind of mission we're going on?
it could be a shooting mission; it could be a dancing mission.
it could be a shoot-dance, which I know isn't really a thing, but knowing our track record, is very much a possibility.
well, let's just save that for the honeymoon, shall we?
so... your family.
sorry, sorry.
they're a little intense about the wedding, huh? They're very sweet.
but... But...?
I have a proposition for you.
okay. What if we eloped?
I know that you want the big family wedding, but your family is going to be this intense until we get married, so...
what if we- just the two of us were to run away to some beautiful, romantic, amazing place?
then all of this stress and pressure could be avoided.
think about it.
is she trying to kill me?
I know. Elope?
I can't elope. Of course you can't!
who's going to be the best man? I'll tell you who.
some weird, creepy cousin of some weird, old stranger you find to marry you.
and then his weird, old wife who smells like Thousand Island dressing is going to stand up for Sarah.
and then you're stuck with a bunch of weird, old, stinky strangers in your wedding photos.
I just got my family back together, you know? I have a niece now.
I want them to be in my wedding.
but you know, marriage is about compromise, and this is what Sarah wants.
but you giving Sarah what she wants and me not getting what I want is not, necessarily, "compromise.
the point is- and I'm sorry to say this to you, buddy, because
I know you've never been able to do this with a lady, ever
but you're going to have to put your foot down.
just say no.
no, huh? To Sarah?
this is what I think you should do, okay? You start by saying no to something far less important, and then, you know, slowly work your way up.
a practice "no. " Practice "no.
interesting.
okay. Cut through and enter here.
Chuck, do you need some water? Uh...
you know what?
no.
okay.
actually, yes. I'm kind of thirsty.
OK let's go.
do you want pliers?
Yeah.
some fortress.
Yeah, well, looks like we need a costume change.
making me, once again, right to, as you say, "over-pack " .
by the way, for the record, I will not at any point during this mission be dressing as a belly dancer.
what if you need to do it for our country? I'm sure America can handle it.
by the way, if you're into the Moroccan thing, we could always elope here.
just think about it. Come on.
let's go. In here.
again, Casey, I can't apologize enough for that accidental touching in there.
just very a tight changing space. Yeah. Don't mention it.
looks like Roan is upstairs.
let's go.
Oh, super bad Saudi oil tycoon at 12: 00.
what do you think they're doing here?
it's not our mission. Let's find Montgomery and figure out what's up. Come on.
well, according to the tracker, Roan is in that room, over there.
after you, Casey.
okay. This could get fun.
finally, my little minx. Did you bring the oils?
shall we celebrate the little soiree I made for you downstairs?
wait, wait, wait.
I hear the footsteps of... Ooh, two women.
and a large man.
darling, you know I like it spicy, but I do think... Don't you mean "two large men"?
you three? What are you doing here?
rescuing you. You're welcome. I don't need...
rescuing. Unlike you, Colonel Shoot 'Em Up,
I can finesse my way out of any situation.
and what situation would this be, exactly?
listen, I don't have time to go into it, but I'm about to blow Fatima's counterfeiting ring wide open.
wait, you're on a mission?
Yes. She's making super notes.
wait a minute. How'd you find...
who sent you? General Beckman.
Gen...
Diane's birthday present. The watch. It's got a tracking device in it?
well, you've got to leave. She's going to be here any second.
we're going to, um... seal our partnership.
Oh, look, look. She's coming. She's coming. You've got to hide.
just hide. Go, go. Here, go! Hide!
how is my naughty little turncoat?
ready to be your naughty little turn-on.
you are very feisty, eh?
Oh, feed me or beat me.
I don't care. Just get in here.
so, everything's set up for Friday.
you're going to meet my mom.
are you excited? What? I am so excited.
Absotutely. You kidding me? Yeah, yeah. It's just that I have a little surprise for you, as well. Really? Yeah.
I talked to your father.
and he agreed to get in touch with your mom.
let her know that he's okay, alive and well, and back in the picture.
isn't that great? Come on.
what? Morgan, no.
no, that is not great at all.
I have been keeping my dad a secret from my mom on purpose, okay?
to protect her, because for the first time in her life she's finally happy.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, bad initiative.
I thought it would have made you happy.
okay, I'm sorry. I'll fix this, okay? I promise.
you look a lot like your father right now.
a cigar right now and a knife, and you would...
you've been a very naughty, naughty little spy.
Oh, you better teach me a a lesson, then.
Yes, I will.
Chuck, if you get us caught because you sneeze, we are officially the worst spies in the world.
I know. Bad Three Stooges.
I get it. And I, and I... and I won't.
but man, it is dusty. We have to get out of here.
let's just take Fatima out. We'll grab Roan and bail out the window.
okay, copy that.
you good, Chuck?
um... no.
no?
Yeah, no. I-I said no because I think... I think Roan is making some good headway here and we should let him finish.
the mission. Finish the mission.
but...
but nothing, okay? I said no...
woman.
sometimes in a relationship people disagree about things and...
see, see? Not the worst spies in the world.
guards!
betrayer!
no, not betrayer, lover. Shut up!
these are clearly your comrades.
take them all to the dungeon.
baby... this is all a misunderstanding.
it's me, Roan.
sit tight. I'll get you out.
so, last I saw you two you were a young, exciting couple- chasing, flirting.
now, the silent treatment.
sexy.
if you must know, we are very much in love, happy, and soon to be married.
we're just... having a bit of a disagreement right now, and the ball and chain isn't helping.
are you calling me a ball and chain?
there's a ball and ch... there's an actual ball and chain here.
do you... Do you not see this on the ground attached to my leg?
ball and chain. Yes, thank you.
what's with all the "no" lately, anyway?
I may have been a little obstinate before.
okay, let me guess. This is about something bigger.
performance issues.
No! I am adequate. More than adequate in that depart... Right?
you can't, you can't agree with me?
I don't want to... Sarah, I don't want to elope.
okay? I just don't. Not at all.
not even in the slightest bit.
I've always wanted a big family wedding, and now more than ever, so no.
my answer to eloping is no.
okay, fine. I hear what you're saying.
but why do you get to say no?
what about what I want?
okay, I've got eyeballs on the dungeon door, and there is a lady guard.
I'm gonna seduce my way past her.
Oh, no. Uh-oh.
what? What's happening?
Casey's gonna try and seduce the guard.
No! What? The man who flunked my course at the farm twice?!
Casey, that's not a very good idea. Don't you have a gun or some explosives?
Yeah, because you're terrible at seduction. You have no finesse!
I heard that.
blowing the door will only alert the other guards.
now, this is exactly the type of girl I know how to charm.
Oh, God, he's gonna charm her.
look, tranq and explode!
Casey, tranq and explode!
evening.
stop!
that's a lovely weapon you have there.
go.
gosh, it must get awfully lonely down here in the dungeon by yourself, no one to talk to.
Yes. Yes, it does.
cold, too.
you can take it. You're hearty.
I can see why they didn't assign one of those skinny ones down here.
don't tell me.
so you tranqed her and blew the door.
how charming.
I rescued you. Shut up.
okay, let's get out of here.
I'm staying here. What? Why?
I told Beckman about Montgomery's leads.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of these super notes. Get him back to Burbank.
Oh, yes, about that,
I'm not going back to the States with you.
Thanks, all the same. This has been a debacle.
no, Roan, we need to take you back with us. No, thank you...
really. Beckman said he might try that.
tell Morgan I'll be back in a week or two. See you.
okay, well, mission accomplished. Sarah and I will go upstairs and let you guys catch up.
sit... down! Sitting down, ma'am.
agent Montgomery, your mission to Morocco, who ordered you to go?
well...
no one did!
Fatima Tazi, the super notes?
you went after them without any authorization, and now I have one of my best agents hidden inside a Moroccan fortress without backup!
be on standby.
if Colonel Casey gets into trouble in Morocco,
I am sending you in to get him out.
general...
if there's trouble, I'll get Casey out.
no. You're done, Roan.
I have a new mission for you.
Charles, you should never sneak up on a spy.
even a former one.
right. Sorry.
so, how's, uh, how's everything going?
I've never felt polyester against my skin before.
I feel a chafing. The chafe of stylelessness.
I hear you on that.
listen, Roan, I'm-I'm kind of going through my own spy relationship turmoil thing, situation here, and I was just- I wanted to ask you about the general.
is this about the Morocco thing? Of course not.
Diane is upset about Berlin.
Berlin? Chuck, sit down.
I have a few minutes left on my break.
Berlin. 1989.
not a good year for building walls in East Germany.
we had just won the Cold War.
I was off to Moscow on an assignment.
Diane was on her way back to Washington and a promotion.
we wouldn't see each other for months, and just before I left, she asked the question.
what about us?
that's when I said it.
I'm not even sure why, but I told her, "If we're alive in 20 years, let's throw in the towel, be a normal couple, lead a normal life.
Beckman was a dirty blonde? Mm. It was the '80s.
everything was dirty blonde.
we were supposed to meet in Washington a few days ago.
I really wish you'd pick up.
I need to hear your voice tonight.
I'm sorry again that I couldn't make it, but I'm thinking of you.
sweet dreams, and besos, my flower.
Casey. Yes! Listen.
listen, I'm so glad I caught you. This will not take long.
Morgan, I'm on a mission. Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm in a wall. Of course you are.
hear me out, please. I know, I know. Talk to Kathleen.
I will. Actually, you know what?
never mind about that. It's-It's totally cool. Thank you so much, though.
you were right. I'm going to do it.
no, I wasn't totally right, you know.
as it turns out,
Alex doesn't want you to talk to her.
but, uh, enjoy your wall. And come back safe.
so, wait. She doesn't ever want me to talk to her mom?
I don't know, buddy. I don't know.
and, for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry.
in fact, if you need someone to talk to, I'm here. I mean... Got to go.
dig deep in there and... Casey?
I never thought I'd make it 20 years.
I am a spy.
I can't be normal.
it's not who I am. See, that's how I feel about the eloping thing.
that's not who I am.
well, then, you know, you have to stop saying no to Sarah and convince her.
the first thing I teach my students at the farm is when you want to convince an intimate relation, you have to set the scene for the conversation.
create an erotic atmosphere.
Oh, like a sexy situation. Yes, but don't say it like that.
everything is easier with sex in the air.
secrets are shared. Yes's come more easily.
'no " disappear.
Yeah, yeah. I just... I just...
I don't... I don't think I know how to do that.
Charles, come here.
let's try on some shirts. Yes.
now, you're going to need a suit.
I'll be right out. All right, well, listen.
I made us a reservation at this place, so...
just throw on a little something, huh?
and...
what's happening here?
Hi, Chuck.
I'm sorry.
Oh. That's an excellent apology.
I am very sorry, too.
now, I want you to relax, and just think of the two of us running away together.
yeah?
now just imagine, instead of me wearing a white wedding dress in L. A.
with all the family, picture me wearing this just for you anywhere in the world.
sound like fun?
Yeah.
Chuck, elope with me.
Yeah.
no.
wait. No. No, no, no. What are you doing?
I can't believe you're doing this. What?
you're using Roan's methods. Sexy situations? Erotic atmospheres?
you're trying to seduce me.
why are you wearing that outfit? Well, I'm trying to seduce you, too.
just not, clearly, as well.
Beckman wants to see us in Castle.
well, maybe we should change, then.
fine. Fine.
I'm not saying I want to change.
I want... I want you to stay in red...
always, always be in whatever you're wearing right now.
all right, here's the situation.
Fatima's meeting with her financial backers on the other side of this wall.
Fatima, we provided you with $100 million in gold five months ago.
you won't tell us where your mint is, or where you're storing these bills.
level with us. These super notes really exist?
it gives me great pleasure to announce that we have been able to produce more notes than originally anticipated, for a grand total of one trillion dollars.
what are we going to do with one trillion dollars? That is too much currency.
our fortunes depend on a strong dollar.
yours may, but mine does not.
thanks for the gold.
what happened?
Casey? Casey, are you there?
Oh, thank God. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah.
I'm still hidden, but part of the bearing wall came down.
I'm trapped. I may have to cut my arm off.
hold on that, Colonel Casey.
stand by for further instructions.
you're going to Morocco.
we need the location of that mint so we can destroy it.
Yeah, and even more than that, we've got to get to Casey before he chops his own arm off.
general, how are we going to find the location of the mint?
Fatima isn't going to tell us anything.
only one man could possibly get the information out of her.
roan? Ma'am, Fatima will have Roan shot on sight.
no man could seduce Fatima Tazi twice. It's a...
seduction impossible. Get him.
general, I know that Roan has broken a promise or two, but you can't send the man to his own death.
get me Roan Montgomery!
and that is the story of Sleeping Beauty.
you know, Grandma once had to take a potion that made me sleep for a couple of days.
but Grandma's partner had a potion, too.
and when it was time to wake me up, he put the antidote on his lips and woke me with a kiss, just like the prince.
grandma was on a mission.
can you say "mission"?
a seduction? No problem. But a rope climb?
I am getting a little old for this.
okay, climb over. Get to the boudoir, and seduce the location of the mint out of Fatima. We'll get Casey.
once we have the location of the mint, our attack drones will take it out.
move out.
one last thing.
in case I don't see you two crazy kids again, do one thing for me. Remember you're in love.
listen to each other.
never go on a mission angry.
please, don't call out for help.
I had to come back to you, my love.
what are you doing here?
just hear me out, please.
I'm not here as a spy. I'm here because of you.
I never wanted to leave you.
I was extracted because of another woman.
another woman?
who?
my general.
who is impatient. Get the location of the mint, Roan.
all this interpersonal stuff on a mission?
it's very unprofessional. I know!
I don't want to fight. Me, neither.
okay, well, look, we know my family's stressful, but what else?
what, uh, you know, other pros and cons of having a big wedding?
well, okay, I mean, who am I gonna invite?
who's gonna come? Who's gonna walk me down the aisle?
I'm such an idiot. This was never about my family.
this is about yours. I'm so sorry. I should have figured that out.
I should have told you and not had you figure it out.
you have got to be kidding me with this conversation. I am about to cut my arm off.
Casey, hey. Yes.
good. Sorry. We're right here.
darling, I know you're not after wealth.
your heart is far too pure for that.
what is it you want? Why don't you tell me?
let me help you.
when I was a girl, my village was destroyed by an American conglomerate.
they strip-mined over my entire world.
so I am going to flood the markets with one trillion U. S. dollars.
the American economy will collapse, and it will be my little village that brought them down.
Yes, you told me about your village.
it's called... Setouan.
is that right?
Yes. You listened.
of course.
I'd love to visit it someday.
I've got the village on my monitor.
there's the mint.
we got it!
this is Beckman, authorization 8485-Charlie.
initiate air strike, sending grid coordinates now.
air strike... Chuck, Sarah, get Casey out of there.
we just need a minute.
general, we're gonna be slightly delayed.
Chuck, what's happening?
bad guys. Lots of bad guys.
right behind you.
take one step to the left.
the other left, idiot.
don't move! Never done this before.
what? Never done what before?
there are Americans in the palace.
you... bastard!
Yes, I answer to that.
what do we do?
kill them.
well, that takes care of your friends.
Casey, you are great! Get me out of here!
right. Right.
now to deal with you, Roan.
so sorry. Oh. So rude.
Hi. Could I call you right back? I'm right...
who is this? This is General Diane Beckman.
with whom am I speaking?
this is the woman who is about to kill your agent.
good. It's about time.
good?
she said, "Good.
we're in the middle of a tiff.
I don't want to stop you.
I'd just like to say one last thing to Roan.
I'm happy to see him die.
another one of your admirers.
hello. Diane, listen, I just want to say that I am truly sorry, but, you know, I can be such a bastard.
thank you, Roan.
Oh, one more thing. Yes?
duck!
Roan! Roan, are you there?
is he alive?
we got him, General.
he's right here. Oh...
are you okay?
I still got it.
Yeah.
Where's the bar? Come on.
let's go. Let's get out of here. What's the hurry?
here is to the woman who blows everyone else away.
seeing you in action again- it was like old times.
old times? I like to say " the 80s " .
darling, listen, there's something... Mm. I know.
you don't want to settle down. You're not made for that.
you're a spy. That is your life.
almost like you rehearsed that. It was my speech to you.
you changed your mind, too?
why did you hunt me down?
Roan, you never run away from a general.
Yes, of course.
but I do hope our rendezvous aren't over.
Budapest last spring was divine.
well...
I have high hopes for Morocco tonight.
good for you, Kath.
mom.
30 more seconds, then we check the temp.
mom? What is it?
having you here has been great.
but you are ready to try it on your own.
I get it. No. No, it's not that.
I would keep you here forever, if I could.
mom, do you really want to be a full-time grandma?
it's okay.
this is what I dreamed of for so many years.
I made Chuck quit the CIA, and sometimes I wonder if that was the right decision, because I know that he's a good person who's helped people, and he's protected us.
he's a Bartowski.
and he says that you're the best.
I can't keep another person from being a hero simply because I'm... afraid.
if you need to be a spy, that's not another abandonment.
you'll still be in our lives.
I want to give everything to this baby that I never gave to you or Chuck.
but that's my job.
you just have to be the best grandma in the world.
so...
tell me about the agent who kissed you awake on the secret mission.
he was a big romantic.
and the greatest husband there ever was.
well, I'm glad we talked.
me, too.
I think eloping just seemed like a way for me to avoid my family.
Sarah, you've done so much to help my family. How can I help yours?
I don't know. It's different.
Sarah, come on.
it's our job to take care of some of the world's biggest problems.
terrorists and despots and oligarchs.
I mean, I think we can handle a family, even yours.
you are Sarah Walker, the most mysterious woman in the world, so as the future Mr. Sarah Walker, can't I get to know you better?
Hi, I'm Chuck, and here's what's been going on in my life lately.
this is a not a real attack, is it?
no, this is our competition.
Verbanski Corp took all of our clients.
told you. You put me out there, you don't have to worry about what other companies are doing.
morgan needs a handler. - What? Who, me?
you be my handler. Yeah!
just because you have the Intersect in you doesn't mean you don't have something to learn still!
I have something I can offer you no one else can.
okay, target acquired.
distance to intercept: 100 meters.
this is it. You ready, Casey?
readiness like life begins at the point of conception.
where am I headed?
other side of the street. You should be hitting a one-way.
head south to initiate intercept.
Roger that.
you okay? Your blood pressure just went through the roof.
I'm fine.
how much time till intercept?
steady. In five, four, three, two, one.
Gertrude, hey. What are the chances?
I was just, going around the corner to that little oyster bar.
cerulean - that... that is my favorite restaurant.
what are the chances?
you know, I could really go for some Blue Points right about now.
did you hear that? The target is yours.
ask her out. She practically just asked you out.
blue Points are delicious.
especially with a little mignonette sauce.
boy, that's the best thing the damn French ever gave us.
come on, Casey.
it was great talking to you.
no, wait! Just give a kiss on the cheek.
just let her know you're available and interested!
I guess I'll, see you around?
so you froze up. It happens to the best of us.
no, I didn't freeze.
then what do you call that?
reconnaissance.
wait. You planted a bug on Verbanski?
piggybacks off her cell phone's Wi-Fi.
that's a weird move, Casey.
this way I can find out everything I need to before I ask her out.
I'm pretty sure that's why people go on dates, to get to know one another.
just do me a favor, don't tell Chuck and Morgan about it.
lips are sealed.
how many triple words are you gonna leave open, Jeff?
my God, he's dumb.
boom! 87 points?! It's good to be the Intersect.
please, buddy, we're on a mission.
right. Sorry.
I thought we were just sitting in some Burbank parking garage.
I'm sorry, you got somewhere you need to be?
I have a hot date. No biggie.
if this is how you choose to use the world's greatest super-computer. Well...
okay, okay, this is actually what I needed to talk to you about.
the attitude.
am I not the world's greatest...?
being the Intersect doesn't mean you have to constantly talk about being the Intersect.
you did it your way, I'll do it my way.
I hate to say it, buddy, but you're starting to remind me of seventh-grade Morgan,
stay here.
got it, boss.
it's good to see you again.
I trust you and your team are well?
hanging in there.
turns out working in the private sector is...
look, I think it's better if we keep this brief.
no offense.
you've heard of Mats Zorn?
Yeah, rich guy with the whistleblower Web site?
makes WikiLeaks look like child's play.
a number of classified CIA memos have fallen into Zorn's hands.
so, you want us to grab Zorn?
and the documents.
the drive contains his itinerary.
Zorn doesn't stay in one place any longer than it takes refuel, but we have him passing through L. A.
this is a paying gig, right? - There's a sizeable bounty on Zorn.
I'm outsourcing to your team to circumvent the leak.
my only condition is that no one breathes my name in relation to the mission.
what up, baby girl?
I told you to come alone.
you doing Pilates? You are, don't say you're not. You are.
what the hell is wrong with him?
so many things. - Becky, your core's really tight.
I thought you were Morgan. - No, I just dropped him off at the Buy More.
what?
guess he forgot about our plans.
I wouldn't say that.
I mean, he did mention having a hot date, so...
well, clearly it's with someone else.
is there something going on between you two?
you would tell me if Morgan's seeing someone else, right?
Yes. And no, he is not.
he's had a lot on his mind lately, that's all.
let me track him down and talk some sense into him, okay?
okay.
chin up. -Thanks.
how'd it go with the general?
piece of cake.
data drive with the mission's locked up tight in Castle.
so what's the problem? - Morgan.
I tried to have a heart-to-heart with him about his...- Overblown ego?
anyway, he went AWOL.
Casey, can you can help with a surveillance detail?
none of your business.
you got a wire up on someone? Who is it?
corporate espionage. He's just sizing up the competition, that's all.
perving out on Gertrude.
weird move, Casey. - I told you.
so, have you considered my offer?
Gertrude, do me a favor.
what is he doing in her office?
that's a good question.
next time you make me an offer like that to me, why don't you go ahead and spit in my face instead?
thank you, Morgan.
Bubala...I offer you the services of the world's greatest spy, and you don't have the decency, the common courtesy to offer me my own personal assistant?
bush league.
you drive a hard bargain, Mr. Grimes.
Yeah, I try.
welcome to Verbanski Corp.
you little...traitor.
I'm gonna like it here.
Hey, what are you doing? It's so early.
I couldn't really sleep, so I figured I'd head into the office early.
well, why didn't you wake me?
I mean, we could have talked about it.
I know what Morgan did hurt you.
I'm not,... hurt. I'm just angry.
you know, the Intersect is an integral part of our business, and Morgan just sold it to our number-one rival.
morgan is also your best friend.
I'm trying not to think about that right now.
okay, her bottle is on the counter.
there's two more in the fridge that need to be warmed up.
Clara eats every two hours, and, normally, she lets you know she's full by spitting up.
that's my girl.
are you sure you're ready for this?
I think it's great that you took paternity leave, it's just...
it's just feeding, burping and wiping. I think I got it, babe.
you know your daddy climbed Matterhorn, was the only one who didn't lose a toe?
okay, I know you're tough, but being with a baby all day is a different kind of tough.
so you pace yourself.
you're on Clara time now.
Bye, sweetie.
good-bye, Mommy. Say, "You got it.
okay, it's 9: 00 a. m. What do you want to do first?
we should probably clean up before Mommy gets home?
9: 45?
in the a.m? It's only been 45 minutes?
what are we gonna do with the rest of the day?
don't scuff it, all right, Cabbage Patch?
what's up, bro? You want to talk to me?
Morgan, did you dye your hair?
no. I Frosted my tips.
I think it makes my eyes pop.
are you wearing lifts?
Oh, boy. They're orthotics, okay?
they're for my posture.
and it's cool because Cruise wears them.
what is... what is going on with you?
you smell like the Glendale Galleria.
it's Ed Hardy. I'll send you a bottle.
what is this? My three-week notice.
What?! You backdated it three weeks.
Oh, yeah? Well, I been busy, Chuck.
working for Verbanski Corp?
Ah, you heard. Monster deal.
I was gonna tell you when the ink was dry.
no, no, no, no, I get it, I get it you're busy.
God, I knew it I knew you were gonna do this, man!
do what?
you know, just take this whole thing and make it all personal.
personal? Personal? How is this personal?
do you understand?! Our business needs you.
we need the Intersect!
Carmichael Industries is just starting to get off the ground right now.
Yeah. Yeah, well, I just came for some stuff out of my office.
I would have sent my decorator, but she's all busy with Mark Wahlberg's place.
Hollywood...
think it through, moron.
you walk out on us, you never walk back.
please, save it, all right, everybody?
you had the greatest weapon on the planet and you chose not to use me.
that's on you.
so you went and told Verbanski about the Intersect?
Morgan, we were just trying to protect you, that's all.
don't do this.
it's already done, okay, Chuck?
it's too late. I don't need any of this crap.
you sure you want to do that, Johnny?
fine. Leave.
but there's no way I'm letting a traitor date my daughter.
right, right, right. Your daughter, your daughter, sure.
excuse me. I'll take care of that right now.
sweet little Allie...
Alex! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, whatever.
there you go.
you text message break up with my little girl?
well, I can do better.
you...! Just let him go.
what do you want me to do? You want me to kill him?
cause I'll kill him.
better yet, let's keep him alive.
you can work him over for a while. Yeah.
no, Dad, I don't want you to hurt Morgan.
I love him. I just...
I just don't understand how he could be so awful, you know?
just tell me what to do.
he just...
I just don't understand.
I just want the old Morgan back, you know?
I know it hurts, honey.
we Caseys we don't like to open up, make ourselves vulnerable.
cause when someone does rip our heart out and stomp on it right in front of our eyes, it could be like the worst torture of all.
I just want you to know that I'm always here for you.
always will be.
charity Hospital will return after these messages.
Hello, friends. Sorry if I'm interrupting, but we have something important to discuss...
who's that handsome devil?
if you're in a pickle, why not on come down to your neighborhood Buy More, where a green shirt can help you find your way.
you know, he's right.
we should head to the Buy More.
that backup juicer's probably on its last leg.
Yeah, that should kill a couple hours.
just got to make it to dinner, right?
something is wrong with Morgan. This isn't like him.
sure it is.
his new powers they pushed him to the Dark Side.
he doesn't have a dark side.
it's like middle school all over again.
like when Morgan grew his first mustache-full, thick, manly.
like a miniature Tom Selleck.
thought he was cock of the walk.
cool, sarcastic, mean.
made our lives a living hell for a few weeks.
that is, until Meredith Lester showed up.
and she grew a mustache, too?
no, she did not, no.
one day in gym class, Meredith snuck up behind Morgan and pantsed him in front of everyone.
exposed him for who he really was.
we went back to being uncool by fifth period.
and we went back to being friends by the end of the day.
that's it!
you're going to drop Morgan's pants?
metaphorically, yes.
we finish Beckman's mission, we show Verbanski that Morgan's not as cool as he thinks he is, and...and you'll be best friends by the end of the day?
exactly.
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - What, what is it?
Oh, my God, what is that smell?
ed Hardy cologne.
it's gone. The zip drive's gone.
the little bearded bastard stole it.
he stole our mission. He probably took it with him to Verbanski Corp.
I can't believe...
morgan just pantsed us!
what are you two doing?
we're taking down our competition.
anybody work here anymore?
don't worry, Clara, I'm going to find someone to look after you.
Lester, come here.
guard this child with your life.
the Chosen One.
come on, I got you, man.
get up, Jeff. Use your legs.
I am going to take a knife and fork and just eat those chubby little cheeks.
Yes, Uncle Lester...
what are you doing, man? You're scaring her.
no.
okay? And what are you doing?
are you trying to kill yourself?
I'm just taking off the exhaust pipe, trying to squeeze a few more horses out of the beast.
ever hear of carbon monoxide, guys?
can't leave your engine running. No, he has to leave the engine running or he can't start it up again.
and the engine noise helps me sleep.
hold up. Are you telling me that you sleep in your van with the engine running?
I'm sorry. What was the question?
Jeff, you need to see a doctor, man.
I'm worried you might have damaged your brain.
no, Jeffrey doesn't have a brain, silly-pants.
listen, just give me a call I'll give you a quick consult.
Really? - Caught me on a slow week.
okay, Clara, let's go, honey.
no, five more minutes. - Come on, Clara. Thanks, though.
five more minutes. - Come on... Thank you.
Verbanski CROP
my biological clock is tick-tocking.
you realize this is breaking and entering.
Verbanski can shoot us all with impunity.
well, her little goon Grimes stole our mission.
we're going to steal it back.
so this has nothing to do with revenge against Gertrude and Morgan?
absolutely not.
if we don't get the bounty on Zorn, Carmichael Industries goes belly up.
and if we don't stop Zorn from posting those files, no telling how many agents are going to get burned.
fine. Where are we going?
the zip drive's in your girlfriend's office, Casey.
the only problem is getting through the door. Roger that.
I can infiltrate. You two take down security.
you sure that's a good idea?
well, I mean, you know, you and Verbanski.
there is no me and Verbanski.
coming from the guy who put a surveillance bug on her.
that was before she poached one of my team.
that woman is dead to me.
what are you guys doing here?
come on, let's grab their uniforms.
Casey, Verbanski's office is on your right.
don't touch the handle.
what's the hold up?
just accessing the system.
okay, go.
what is he doing?
I have no idea.
Casey, we are on a bit of a schedule here.
Casey, is everything okay in there?
Yeah, A-OK.
Casey, you've got incoming.
bingo.
let's start with the Zorn mission briefing.
Scotty, what is this?
a tall soy latte with two Splendas.
soy? Who said anything about soy?
what do you want me to do, start lactating for you?
I'm not sure what you mean.
I asked for almond milk. Al-mond milk.
you megalomaniacal little bastard.
okay? Please fix it. - Yes, sir.
this is the best Harvard has to offer?
Casey, watch out, it's Verbanski.
got it. Let's move.
what's the matter?
nothing.
man Blue team, please report to the east training field.
blue team to the east training field.
okay, I got to boogie. That's my class.
okay, I suppose our mission briefing can wait.
okay.
what are you doing here?
they just called us. Hurry up.
blue team, right? We got to go.
I hear the new instructor's a real monster.
right, yeah.
is that a zip drive in your pocket, or are you just excited to see me?
I'm here because you stole our mission, and our moron.
so you weren't following me downtown, - working up the nerve to ask me out? - I don't date thieves.
Sarah, what is the holdup?
well, well, well.
look at this sorry bunch.
Verbanski wants me to whip you into shape.
I'll tell you what. We're gonna play a little game.
what we're going to do is, I'm going to point to one of you and you're going to step up, using whatever technique we choose and try and take me down.
you all seem so excited.
you come here.
too slow. You're just too slow.
my software is just way too fast for you.
you, you, you.
enough foreplay?
I'm not for play.
get over yourself, Gertrude.
what are you waiting for, princess?
come on.
I'll be gentle.
your master has taught you well.
I am the master.
Chuck. What are you doing here?
I'm here to take back what you stole from us, buddy.
no, no. The Intersect is mine. - The Intersect?
I want the Zip drive, okay?
you can keep the Intersect, Gollum.
ever since you started zooming, you're acting a little bit big for your breeches.
no, my breeches fit just fine, thank you very much.
you're just jealous.
Oh, oh, oh? Jealous?
right, jealous that I was a better spy than you ever were.
that I take the Intersect to a whole new level, man.
you know what, Morgan? We're friends, so I'm going to give you a chance here.
no, that's the thing, Chuck.
we are not friends.
no. No, forget that. I stand by it.
we are not friends.
we got the drive. Okay, Chuck, come on. Let's get out of here.
Verbanski Grimes, there's been a breach.
I need you to secure the zip drive.
you heard my boss.
hand it over.
no. - Do not make me do this, John.
you know what I'm capable of.
just hand it over before someone gets hurt.
God, I love the Intersect.
Really? That's what we're going to do here?
Zorn arrives in L. A. tonight.
business meeting downtown.
just enough time for him to switch planes and disappear.
let me see that last tail number.
helicopter. I'll pull up satellite on the address.
looks like a helipad to me. That's where we'll grab him.
Carmichael Industries will be seven figures in the black.
won't be long till we're the new Verbanski Corp.
guys, I think we should talk about Morgan and Gertrude.
I told you, Walker, she's dead to me.
well, then, how do you explain whatever that was in her office?
clearly, you still have feelings for her.
and you I know what Morgan did hurt you, but you saw the way he was behaving.
I really think it's time to admit this is more than just an ego problem.
pure seventh-grade Morgan.
but what if it's not? What if Morgan needs help?
Sarah, he said that we're not friends anymore, so how am I supposed to help him now?
so, Jeff, when's the last time you saw a doctor?
when was the last time I got something stuck up in me?
have any trouble focusing?
that's a yes.
any problems with your short-term memory, Jeff?
doc.
do you know I'm cha-cha under here?
all right, buddy, keep the gown down.
do you have any trouble performing at work?
I got that one.
we're going to mark that as a yes as well.
all right, I'm just going to write you a script here, buddy, and get you on your way.
should take care of all your problems.
goody. Pills.
stop sleeping in your van, Jeff.
okay? Doctor's orders.
what are you saying? Is there something wrong with Morgan?
I just...I I feel like he's losing himself.
I mean, why would the Intersect act so differently in Morgan's head versus Chuck's head?
well, because it's a different program.
somebody modified Dad's original.
look, if you think that there's something wrong, you should have the CIA remove it.
I just don't think he's going to go for that.
like I said, Morgan is not acting like Morgan at all.
well, you need to try to get through to him.
how?
well, you could try to appeal to his memory.
you know, I've had temporal lobe patients who've responded to stories about who they were before the injury.
it doesn't return them to normal, but it sort of helps them cut through the fog-in this case, the Intersect.
gives them a glimpse of who they used to be.
agent Walker, is the target in custody?
no. This isn't about Zorn; it's about the Intersect.
it's malfunctioning in Morgan.
morgan Grimes has the Intersect?
look, it was a mistake.
remember the glasses that you sent to us after we took down Volkoff?
what? Well, then, who did?
ready, Casey? Let's go.
where you been, Walker?
Zorn's not going to wait for us.
I just talked to Beckman. It's about Morgan.
the Intersect that he uploaded, it wasn't from her.
what? Then, who?
decker or somebody else in the CIA. She doesn't know.
why would anyone want to hurt Morgan?
you. It was meant for you.
I spoke to your sister, and Morgan's behavior is not his fault.
it's the Intersect.
he's forgetting who he is.
little Allie.
I can do better.
good job, Indy. - Who?
he didn't remember Indiana Jones.
so Star Wars or Die Hard?
you pick, man.
that's more your thing.
or Trilogy Night.
Oh, my God, this isn't just seventh-grade Morgan.
I can't believe I didn't see this earlier. He was my best friend.
is my best friend.
Sarah, we got to find him.
according to Beckman, he's on his way downtown to the Marriott.
he's tracking Zorn? - Must have copied that zip drive.
little snake in the grass.
right, it's not his fault.
guys, let's save Morgan.
if we must.
must be holed up in one of the rooms.
hopefully, his helicopter will be landing soon and we won't have any trouble subduing his flight crew.
or security detail he usually travels with at least four former operatives.
guys, Morgan should be here by now.
his team had a head start on us.
maybe something came up.
maybe he betrayed them, too.
he left Alex.
down, down, down, down, down!
what the...? - Morgan and Verbanski stole our plan.
they're going to grab Zorn.
so Zorn is traveling with four guards.
that's it? - After neutralizing them, we'll load Zorn into the aircraft and return to headquarters.
listen, I'm not paying you to play games.
if we land Zorn, there's no telling what kind of business
we don't stop them, Gertrude's going to put us out of business.
Chuck, what are you doing?
I'm going to talk to my friend.
Morgan. Don't shoot.
take him out before he spooks the target.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
What'd you think, Chuck, you and your team were just gonna swoop in here and snatch up Zorn?
not happening.
this isn't about Zorn. I'm here to help you, Morgan.
Oh, right, right. Like before, when you pulled my pants down and you tranquil me?!
stop shooting! What do you want?
mats Zorn, you're under arrest. - Mats Zorn, you're under arrest.
I knew it.
you came here to make me look like a loser.
no, no. Morgan, the Intersect that you uploaded, there's something wrong with it.
I bet there is, it's not in your head.
Morgan, there was some kind of Trojan horse hidden in the software.
please, please, come on baby.
just admit it. Please, for me, just admit that...that you cannot handle the fact that I'm the bad-ass operative with the bad-ass tips - Ladies, please stop fighting! - Shut up!
can't you see it? Can't you feel the Intersect changing you?
that's-that's why you're not acting like yourself.
why would I want to act like myself?
do you even remember who I was before? - Yes, Morgan!
do you?
holy hell! Is that real?
turn off the engine, Zorn!
stop the engine or I will blow us all to hell!
Morgan, you're not a killer.
shut up, Chuck, okay? How would you know?
because you got pantsed by Meredith Lester in seventh grade.
Chuck, you've got to unlock his memory.
I don't even remember seventh grade.
sure you do.
put the gun down, Morgan, and try to remember what she did to you.
even if I did remember, Chuck, why?
why would I want to remember being humiliated by some stupid girl?
because then you'd remember how we got back at her.
what do you mean "we"? Yeah,"we.
I'm your best friend. Always have been.
who else would have helped you stand up to the queen of eighth grade?
what did we do, exactly?
we stole Meredith's ham sandwich during homeroom, and then we...
did something to it.
we are we spiced it up somehow.
Yes. Yes!
you're right, Morgan.
but what did we put in it?
something... it was something really, really awful.
I can see it in my head.
I can't, I just, I can't, it's like a...gnarly, curly...
- Yes!
we shaved off my first mustache and we sprinkled it on her sandwich!
I remember now.
Chuck, I... I remember.
that's who you are.
that's who I am.
please... take me to jail.
you cuff him, I'll grab the case.
does that mean we split the bounty?
I'm sure we can work something out.
Gertrude... can I... can I have a minute?
listen, I just wanted to say thank you for the opportunity, but I don't think it's gonna work out.
poor kid. That's tough.
the auxiliary tank's gonna blow the whole roof!
wait, Chuck!
I knew you were into me, John.
shut up, Gertrude.
thank God.
still friends.
no.
of course.
thank you.
thanks for pantsing me.
anytime, buddy.
anytime.
if I take the Smith and Wesson, it'll show her that I'm rugged and dependable.
maybe the Sig, she'll think I'm cool and sophisticated.
I'll just take them both.
so you're taking Verbanski to the gun range on your first date?
weird move? - No, I think she's going to love it.
well, good luck.
sure you don't want to tag along, follow in the van?
I am wired for sound.
I think this is a solo mission.
Thanks, Walker.
is Casey wearing Morgan's cologne?
unfortunately.
what's this? Courtesy of General Diane Beckman and the United States government.
our bounty money for Zorn.
that's a lot of zeroes.
that's just the beginning, honey.
Carmichael Industries has a new lease on life. - Wonderful.
dude, quick, give me five bucks.
why do you need five dollars?
cause Fernando says that if we give him 20, he's gonna let me taser his nads.
is that a good idea?
what do you care if something's a good idea of not.
could I have the money, please?
it just sounds... really dangerous.
Yeah. I know. What if we kill him? That's totally worth 20 bucks.
what is going on with you? Dude... are you high?
What'd you take?
far from it, Lester.
in fact, I'm seeing things clearly for the first time in a long time.
now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go put my quinoa salad in the fridge.
Quin...?
good news your vitals look fine.
good.
I don't feel fine, though.
and I certainly haven't been acting fine.
don't worry, Morgan. I know a very good brain doctor.
almost... almost lost myself to this thing in my head, so I want it out, you know?
but, to be honest, I... I don't know.
part of me thinks I'll kind of miss it.
the Intersect made me this-this, like, super cool super-spy, you know?
now I go back to being some schmuck who works at the Buy More, you know?
I know how you feel.
you do? - Yeah.
you know, when I first became a stay-at-home dad, I lost my identity.
you mind if I give you a word of advice, bro?
of course, dude, yeah. Please. Fire away.
don't confuse a job with your life.
Thanks.
how'd that date with my ex-boss go?
what do you want?
to apologize.
the Intersect made me a total jerk.
not that it was completely the Intersect's fault.
I mean, it just kind of brought out my inner jerk. Who knew?
anyway, my point is, I'm sorry, you know?
I'm sorry that I ever left the team, I'm sorry that I took the zip drive, but most importantly, I am really sorry for what I did to Alex.
I was just a bozo.
you know, I'll just...
the couch maybe, or...?
Morgan. - Hi. Sorry. Casey kicked me out.
let me talk to him.
no, no, no, no... I kinda had it coming.
well, okay, where are you gonna live?
that's cool.
you know? So...
Yeah, I'll be all right. You know, just till I get on my feet.
absolutely not, Morgan. You're gonna stay with us.
say you're gonna lose the frosted tips.
okay, fine.
well, lookie who's back in business.
Beckman must have been so impressed with how we handled Zorn, she's got a nice, big, juicy contract waiting for us.
fantastic, man! Great! Can I take Scotty back on?
I'm kidding.
he's just kind of a... he's a good kid.
we have another problem, Chuck.
there's something I thought you should see.
this is a kill order. This has gotta be a mistake.
morgan told anyone who wanted to hear he had the Intersect.
the CIA does not like that.
it was a mistake. C - Can't you call it off?
this goes way above my head.
he wants Morgan dead.
get Morgan off the street now.
protect him. Protect your friend, Chuck.
come on Morgan, pick up.
Morgan, this is a bad idea.
well, we can't stay here, chuck.
I'm uncomfortable with the plan.
Morgan: Plan?
what plan? This is survival.
that's her. We've been compromised.
I'm a ghost.
Morgan, you can't leave me like this.
you can't do thisto me, man.
Chuck, what are you doing?
uh, escaping.
from your own birthday party?
Hey, ellie.
wow, you look fan...tastic.
uh, you know, sis, the thing is, morgan and I don't really feel like we're fitting in...
at my birthday party, 'cause we don't know anybody, 'cause they'reall your friends and they all happen to be doctors.
doctors who don't really get our jokes.
well, your jokes.
okay, my jokes.
Chuck, I have invited real, live women for you.
so please...
let's go.
Morgan, you stay here.
need a hand, buddy?
no, no, no, I'm okay, I'm all right.
we're going to be social.
you are funny, you are smart, you are handsome.
thank you.
Oh, there's captain awesome.
please don't call him that.
okay, I've identified some candidates for Chuck and they are awesome.
let me introduce you to Chuck Ellie's brother.
Hi, Chuck. We've heard so much about you.
are you in a costume?
no, I-I...
I work for the Nerd Herd.
that is so cute.
what do you really want to do?
working on my five-year plan. Just need to choose a font.
what happened here?
did you hurt your hand?
no, no, it's, uh, from call of duty.
the controller chafes after several hours.
so Ellie said you went to Stanford.
Yes, that's technically correct.
I graduated in '02.
what was your major?
engineering.
Oh, my god, I knew this great guy.
he was an engineer, um, he ran track and I think he was a gymnast, too.
Bryce Larkin - he was my roommate.
Oh, yes.
what's he doing now?
I think he's an accountant.
not an accountant it's hard to say good-bye.
security breach.
data vault.
so, do you have a girlfriend?
uh, no...
I did a while back at Stanford.
Yeah. And her name was Jill.
we met freshman year.
Oh, that was a while back.
I remember when I met Jill, I was...
it was an economics class.
I was walking across the quad and she had dropped her bag, and I was like, you know, rushing to...to go and pick it up for her, and, uh...
and we kind of, like, did that whole, like, you know, kind of in a cartoon--kind of bumped heads, and...
there was a whole gang of us - Jill and Bryce.
we had so much in common then.
how's he doing?
not awesome.
so there I was - Jill with Bryce, me on a train home.
I guess she thought he was more exciting.
Larkin is in the vault.
Larkin, open the door!
the intersect computer's been compromised.
blow the door!
we can't let him go!
call for backup.
Freeze!
stop right there!
cover right!
Larkin, stop!
Larkin is on the roof.
all units converge.
I repeat, Larkin is on the roof.
all units converge.
don't move.
too late, Casey.
thanks for my party.
your seven-layer dip......tasted like eight.
Chuck, can I tell you something?
it really was eight layers?
even though we may ask, no woman really wants to hear about an old girlfriend.
it's depressing, okay?
stanford was five years ago.
you need to move on. It's time.
do we really have to have this conversation again?
we've rehearsed it enough.
fine.
I'll get over Jill tomorrow.
Hey, there.
seems like everybody had a really good time, huh?
I know I did.
super.
cheer up, Chuck, you talked to some women.
you know, it's a start.
Blast-from-the-past wow.
Bryce remembered your birthday, dude.
what?
the guy who got you kicked out of school, the guy who stole your girl, remember that guy?
Yeah, Morgan, I think I remember Bryce.
all right, well...
what, uh, what do we got here?
the terrible troll raises his sword
huh, what is it?
Zork...you remember zork the old text-based video game?
well, Bryce and I programmed our own version of it back at Stanford using a trs-80.
wow, you guys were really cool.
Yeah, if I could only remember what was in my hero's satchel.
the weapons that I would use to kill the terrible troll.
right. You know what, you're still really cool.
and, uh, you're going home.
is it that time?
it's that time.
right.
pedal safe!
thank you.
attack...
troll...
with nasty knife.
dude...
dude, you-you okay?
Yeah, man, yeah, it's me.
what happened?
I was going to ask you the same question.
you okay?
did you spike the punch?
something goes wrong, you blame me.
after all these years, where's the trust?
Yes, I did.
the 101 is clear at universal city.
watch out for delays near burbank airport.
security's checking all vehicles.
we got a sig alert on the I-605, San Gabriel river freeway, at southbound.
a fender-bender on the I-5, Santa Ana freeway, northbound, from 91 freeway to the I...
so this morning I'm playing xbox.
and I'm like, dude, just let me get the sniper rifle,
I'll take care of it - the guy won't give me the sniper rifle.
I made him eat a frag grenade.
as much as I would love to talk video games with you right now,
I've got a really splitting headache and I...
in fact, you know what? Can you do me a favor?
do you mind driving?
are you-are you, look, are you being serious?
you're going to let me drive?
it's a company car, Morgan.
it's not that big a deal.
it's not just acompany car, okay?
a hoopty's a hoopty, home boy.
I mean, this baby's sitting on chrome.
Or...plastic.
okay.
thanks for the tip, ponch.
fellow Nerds, today is going to be a very bad day.
we've got a new computer virus on our hands.
they're calling this one the Irene Demova virus.
Yes, yes, it's named after the Serbian porn star.
lonely dude call volume will be high.
this is a nasty one, kids.
it's a computer killer.
last night, the display version of our prism express laptop was fried when someone...
excuse me...
decided to enter Ms. Demova's web site.
Anna, close the eyes.
this is what happens.
woman: food is sexy?
am I sexy?
am I...sexy...
sorry, Chuck.
she drives me crazy.
but that's love.
ladies and gentlemen, if you'll please just ignore dirty uncle Morgan,
I think that everything...
to arrive in Los Angeles later today to deliver a speech before the pacific security league tomorrow evening...
will be...
the general has drawn fire for his criticism...
normal.
general stanfield, the former allied commander of NATO...
he's already here. He landed last night.
who's already here, chuckles?
trying to stop tomorrow night's speech from happening...
I don't know.
directorate of National Intelligence Washington D. C.
Bryce Larkin was CIA, Graham.
he was one of your agents.
GRAHAM: and it was NSA's job to find him and to question him, not to kill him.
thanks to Rambo here, we've got nothing.
no, you got a dead CIA agent.
it's a gold star in my book.
if this gets out...
it won't.
nobody asked you.
actually, they did.
major Caseyis heading up this investigation.
so what was Bryce after, hmm?
what did this computer do?
well, this computer did everything.
after 9/11, the NSA and theCIA were told to play nice
share their intel.
this is how we did it.
every scrap of data we had went into this computer.
it mined for patterns in the chatter.
saw things we didn't.
the data was encrypted into thousands of images.
whoever received Larkin's e-mail got all of our secrets.
find those secrets, Casey.
I found this on Larkin.
hard drive is fried.
we picked up a trace signature.
where?
Los Angeles.
which is perfect - I've been feeling a little pasty.
stop the presses!
who is that?
I hope I'm not interrupting.
no.
not at all.
That's...it's from Batman.
cause that makes it better.
Hi.
I'm Morgan.
this is, uh, this is chuck.
I didn't think people still named their kids Chuck, or Morgan, for that matter.
my parents are sadists, and carnival freaks found him in a dumpster.
but they raised me as one of their own.
how can I help...you?
I'm here about this.
Oh, yeah. The intelicel.
Yeah. Absolutely.
this model has a little screw that pops loose right in the back here.
just go ahead and give it a couple of quick turns and...
good as new, no problem.
Wow!
you geeks are good.
nerds. I would say Nerds probably more...
it's no big deal.
you know, yeah. I mean, Nerd Herd.
excuse me. Excuse me.
I have an emergency.
I don't know what I did wrong, but I shot the entire recital, but, um, now it...
now it won't play back.
okay.
we'll just take a look and...
you don't have a tape in here.
but it's digital.
Oh, boy.
right. Yes.
but you still need digital tape.
Oh, no.
her mom's going to kill me.
Morgan, I need the wall.
it's yours.
I'm so sorry.
okay. This...this way.
you ready?
what's wrong?
I'm usually in the back row.
Why?
I'm too tall.
I block the other ballerinas.
can I tell you a secret?
but you can't tell the other girls.
real ballerinas are tall.
did you get it?
did it work?
Hi, Harry.
uh, look, we'll be back up and running in five minutes.
five minutes?
do you know what five minutes means in buy more dollars?
I didn't realize we had our own currency.
look, I'm sorry about all the commotion.
we are not stock boys anymore, Chuck!
we are leaders, buy more leaders.
and you wonder why big Mike wants me for assistant manager.
there's an open position?
big Mike didn't tell me about that.
and why should he?
he knows you won't leave the comfort of the Herd.
Chuck, dude, she left you her card.
Yes.
why wouldn't you call this girl?
Oh, I don't know. Did you see her?
Yes. Oh, man, yes.
that's why I'm going to repeat the question.
why wouldn't you call this girl?
because I live on planet earth, Morgan.
why are you following me home?
Aw, come...hey.
we're buddies.
we're going to go do friend things, and...
I needt o use your computer because mine's still acting up on me.
so beautiful and so deadly.
Yeah.
you know, you gotto understand. This is what I've been telling people for I don't know how long...
please, not the computer.
come on, Chuck!
do something!
give me the...
that's my friend!
okay, look, he's not that good of a friend.
didn't you hang that shelf?
damn it.
Nah, I've been through it.
it's dead. It's totally fried.
this hard drive was murdered.
what if you were the unwitting target of a ninja vendetta, and he returns tonight to strangle you with his nunchakus?
that's super, Jeff.
and here I thought I couldn't get any more freaked out.
I'm going to go buy some new locks next door at large mart.
Oh, thank god.
excuse me, sir.
do you know where they sell the...
what do you want?
um...
no. Sorry.
sorry. Nothing.
nothing at all.
just...I was, uh...
look at that.
Oh, god!
come on. Oh, my god! Thank god!
listen! There's a guy here, and he's trying to do something.
I don't know. You have to call the cops...security
the guy at the front who's checking receipts.
what kind of guy?
scary, kind of a terminator vibe.
stubble. Red hair.
black leather jacket?
Yes!
like that guy.
I have eyes on him right now.
like I said, the computer was destroyed.
beyond repair.
okay.
it's done.
I want you in the air in an hour.
but what if he has an external drive?
a backup? -It's over, Sarah.
the NSA is stepping in.
Bryce was CIA, he was our guy, and he burned us.
Casey's on his way out.
you're being recalled.
cause of Casey?
he's a burnout.
he's a killer, Sarah.
I want you to listen to me.
whatever happened with Bryce, you couldn't have known.
you couldn't have stopped.
but I can fix it.
if there's a backup, I'll find it.
just give me 12 hours.
I'm losing my mind.
I'm losing my mind.
I'm losing my mind.
Morgan, not now.
Hi!
hi...
phone trouble again?
Yeah.
I'm not sure I'm able to receive calls, 'cause I never got one from you.
Oh, man! She...
I'm sorry I left so quickly yesterday.
I had an appointmen with a realtor.
I just moved here.
welcome.
Thanks.
and, uh...
I don't really know anyone here.
I was wondering if you would show me around.
that is, if you're free.
Oh, he's free.
he's got nothing but time on his hands.
he is very available.
you guys are going to have a great time.
what's that, sir? Xerox machines? Yeah, I'm on it.
apparently, my schedule is wide open.
great.
Hey, Chuck.
Ellie, captain. Don't freak out.
remain calm.
I have some news.
Chuck's got a date!
what? Who?
way to go, Chuck. That's awesome.
Oh, god, what are you going to wear?
uh...
so, Sarah...
she's nice? Pretty?
Yeah. Actually, Morgan met her online in this kind of chat room...
I'm totally kidding.
try it on.
honestly, this...
I'm a girl;I know what girls like.
I'll go change.
Hey, so, these are left over from the party.
take those.
and, um, don't forget about the old girlfriend rule.
right, got it. No mention of Jill.
aces, Charles.
you're aces.
a dad quote. I'm impressed.
love you, sis. - I love you. Have fun.
I will. I'll try.
they just...
they grow up so fast, you know, and...
go home, Morgan.
just go home. Go home.
he's picking me up for a date.
you're on your own on this one, Sarah.
I can't help you if something goes wrong.
I don't know about this guy, Graham.
nice guys aren't sent government secrets.
what should I do if he runs?
kill him.
so, yeah, I live with my sister and her boyfriend, captain awesome.
No!
it's true, though.
so, so, wait. You call him"captain awesome"?
Yeah, wait till you meet him.
everything he does is awesome:
climbing mountains, jumping out of planes, flossing.
that's funny.
I'm-I'm a funny guy.
clearly.
which is good 'cause I am not funny.
is that your big secret, by the way?
cause I've been sitting here trying to figure out what's wrong with you.
Oh, plenty, believe me.
and I was thinking either she's a cannibal or she's really not that funny, and I was pulling for cannibal 'cause I never met one before.
uh, not a cannibal but I did just come out of a long relationship, so I may come with baggage.
I could be your very own baggage handler.
uh, so the guy, the ex, the guy, the ex is the reason you moved here from, uh, D.C. - Right.
Yeah, after I realized that all of my friends were his friends and that everything about Washington reminded me of...
Bruce, I needed a change, a big one.
Bruce...yeah.
you give me crap for being Chuck and you went out with a Bruce?
that's nice. That's real good.
so, so what about you?
what skeletons do you have in your closet?
any secrets?
any women?
uh, yeah, yeah.
uh, actually, well, back in college there was someone...
actually, that's all over with now and her restraining orders are very specific.
so...
I like you, Chuck.
so, where are we going?
well, do you like music?
I guess.
you guess? What's your favorite band?
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
God, I'm not funny, I don't listen to music.
this must be your worst date ever, right?
I was waiting for you to say "no" .
sorry, sorry, I kind of zoned out there for a second.
no. No, no, no.
God, no, I,uh, I've had...
I've had much, much worse, uh, much worse dates; experiences overall with women.
in 11th grade, actually.
11th grade?
you have to go back that far?
come on.
Chuck Bartowski's your mark.
NSA director wants him with a pulse.
till we find out who he's working with and what he knows, he lives.
CIA skirt...you can kill.
they're good.
good! Good!
let's dance! - I'm not really a dancer.
hey-hey-hey, where's the fire?
Chuck, give me your keys.
I don't mean to be old-fashioned, but the company only wants employees-- nerds
driving the Nerd Herd-Mobile.
I mean, it's kind a, you know...
get in the car.
how did you get into my car?
get in the car right now!
Sarah... - just get in!
what is going on?
please tell me what's going on!
Sarah, you're not even looking!
wait, wait, wait.
who are these guys? What do they want?
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! oh!
Oh, my god, oh, my god, I'm gonna die!
tell me when to turn.
uh, uh, left in five seconds!
your left or my left? - What?
too late!
Oh, my god!
whoa...
computer emergency.
listen to me, Chuck. Those men will hurt you.
they're from the NSA and they're after you.
me? Why, why? Why me?
I'm nobody. I'm the supervisor of a Nerd Herd at a buy more.
maybe one day I'll be assistant store manager and I don't even know if I want that job.
you know, that's not your problem...
but that is.
back! Back!
get out of the car. Let's go, Chuck. Move!
wait, wait...
Sarah, look out!
request emergency air-evac.
track location, we're on foot.
let's go!
how well do you know Bryce Larkin?
what? How do you...
how do you know Bryce?
we worked together at the CIA.
the what?! The CIA?
Bryce is a spy?!
Bryce Larkin from Connecticut is a spy?
a rogue spy. Did he try to contact you?
I haven't heard from Bryce in...
wait. No, he...
he-he sent, he sent me an e-mail.
did you open it?
Yeah. It was, it was a line from Zork. - What?
Zork, it's a video game that we used to play.
it was like a riddle, and I solved it and then there was, uh, pictures.
lots and lots of pictures.
you saw them?
uh, your computer, did you back it up?
is there an external drive?
it crashed a week ago.
wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Was I not supposed to look at those pictures?
okay, I may have to aim my gun at you, so just don't freak out.
Why?
it's late. I'm tired.
let's cut the crap and give him to me now.
he belongs to the NSA.
the CIA gets him first.
you come any closer and I shoot.
Sarah...I'm freaking out.
you shoot him, I shoot you.
I leave both your bodies here, go out for a late snack.
I'm thinking may be pancakes.
Chuck, no!
they're gonna kill him.
kill who?
Stanfield, the general. The general stanfield, the NATO guy.
look, something is wrong with me, okay?
I don't know what it is, but something is very, very wrong with me and I'm remembering things that I shouldn't know.
okay, Chuck, talk to me. Like what?
I don't know. I don't know. For example, uh...
there was, there was a serbian demolitions expert at the large mart today.
that's kind of odd, wouldn't you say?
look, last week the NSA, you guys intercepted some blueprints, blueprints of a hotel, that hotel.
and then the CIA, you guys found a file of schematics of a bomb in Prague.
the bomb is in that hotel!
he was working with Bryce.
no, he opened Bryce's e-mail.
Chuck, those pictures that you saw were encoded with secrets, government secrets.
if you saw them, then you know them.
there were thousands of 'em.
wait a minute.
you're telling me all of our secrets are in his head.
Chuck, is the computer.
what did you, what did you say? What does that mean?
Chuck, you have to listen to me. You have to tell us where...
what's happening to me?
you said there was a bomb. Is there time to stop it?
what? What? Are you crazy?
no, we're the good guys.
we get paid to keep bombs from exploding.
look, I can't, I can't help you, okay?
I really wish that I could, but I can't.
call Bryce. He's the guy that can save the day.
Bryce is dead!
he died sending those secrets to you.
Bryce is dead?
Yeah, and he's gonna have a lot of company unless you start talking.
so, pretty please...
can we defuse the bomb now?
according to the schedule, general's already on the stage.
was our mission to give our nation's diplomats the military perspective on world issues.
now, maybe it was just because I was a uniform...
wait! Casey, wait! We can't take him in. He's too valuable.
okay, johnny commodore.
you stay here, but you tell us where to go.
uh, the easiest way? - No, fastest, Chuck.
the fastest. Got it.
Chuck, stop!
Chuck, wait!
you know, it takes courage to speak out, to take action...
this way!
Chuck, where is it?
I don't, uh...I don't, uh...
that's it.
uh, right here.
Oh, god. - No time to evacuate. Ideas?
disconnect the lap top.
there's no trigger. The cables.
no, definitely a trap.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
ladies and gentlemen, we-we may have a cautionary situation here, so we'll take a short break.
Chuck, is there anything else you remember about the bomb?
Hi, morgan. - Hey, how's it going?
little busy right now, buddy.
in a good way? Details.
why are you calling?
I don't know, just...
laying on your bed, Ellie's with the captain.
my computer's got a case of the Demovas.
so, I figured I'd check in.
you old...
okay, okay, I have an idea.
that's not an XBOX.
and you're not in X Men.
I understand that. This is a prism expresslaptop, okay.
we sell this at our store. It has a DOS override.
I think I can do this. I can do this, please.
he's our best shot.
go.
Mr. Bomb, meet Mr. Internet.
he's searching for porn.
you did it.
I did it. I did it.
I...I defused a real bomb.
this was a real...
what if I was wrong?
don't puke on the c-4, huh?
he's coming with me.
what if this was a fluke?
and what if it wasn't?
what if he can stop something bigger?
fine, we drop him in a psych tank, let him stare at four rubber walls for a decade.
he'll tell us what we want to know.
Casey, we don't know how this works and what triggers the memories.
he'll crack wide open.
not my job.
I break things, I don't fix them.
what about his job? And his friends?
what do we do about his sister?
what about my sister?
nothing. We were just discussing...
no, no, no, hold on a second.
you have to leave my family and my friends out of this.
we'll see.
look, Bryce sent that e-mail to me.
I'm the one remembering your secrets.
which means you have to listen to me, both of you.
and right now...
I'm going to go home.
no, you're not. Uh-uh.
you...you need me.
how long you been here?
all night.
there's now here I can run, is there?
not from us.
talk to me, Chuck.
yesterday I was making 11 bucks an hour fixing computers.
now I have one in my brain.
and I can't figure out why Bryce did this, why he chose me.
what are you going to do with me?
what happens now?
for now, you go back to your own life.
we'll protect you and you'll work with us.
and my sister, my friends, are they in danger?
all night... - all night!
do you know how worried I was? I even called Morgan.
I even got to hang out with ellie. - How far did you get?
Morgan, shut up.
you tell them nothing to keep them safe.
early morning procedure, so...
group hug, huh?
okay. Awesome.
need you to do one more thing for me.
yeah?
trust me, Chuck.
well, wish me luck.
sorry, man.
go get 'em.
didn't think you'd apply.
well, uh...
I think I'm ready for this, big Mike, and what it means
responsibility, decisive leadership...
save it for the interview. Now go train the new guy.
okey.
Hi. My name's Charles Bartowski, but you can call me Chuck.
those are my shoes.
this is my life.
it's filled with spies, car chases, computer-stealing ninjas and me saving the day.
Oh, wait, wait. I'd have to go back.
I work at the Buy More.
it used to be pretty boring.
Chuck! Get over here! Now!
look at this. What happened?
well, way to go, Jeff.
you do realize we don't work for Large Mart.
they're our competition.
can you imagine the shame if some market fiend or Costco stooge put out a display on our Buy More green?
so this has to come down, right?
yesterday.
I now present to you the magic... of Morgan.
this is my best friend, Morgan. He is not a magician.
voila!
see, everything changed when I got an e-mail from my old college buddy Bryce Larkin.
you see, Bryce had been working for the CIA when he stolen a ole bunch of government secrets
big important secrets, really scary, nasty, get-killed-for-having-them secrets.
next thing I know, these super secret are downloaded into my brain, which means every moment lf my life...is in danger.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
the NSA sent their top agent to protect me.
that's Casey. He's pretty scary.
he works at Buy More now,cas aover.
so now I must defend the country from assassins...
no, Casey!
terrorists...
and shoplifters.
Casey, Casey, Casey. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. It's just a video game, okay?
lives are not in danger, and the country is still safe.
this guy's been here 24 hours and he's taking the job way more seriously than me.
that's because he's crazy.
tell me something I don't know.
Oh, hey, dawg. Nice to see you again, pal. Huh?
you're not so tough now, are you?
Oh, you don't like that, huh?
the CIA sent their top agent too.
Oh, yeah, I know. Believe me.
she told me to trust her.
but just like any woman, she's got a past.
and... she's posing as my girlfriend.
Sarah, what, uh... What are you doing here?
I work here now, Chuck.
Oh, damn.
I burned another batch.
why are you working here?
surveillance.
I can monitor the Buy More from here while you work.
it's just a cover.
right, yeah, a part of the plan. 'Cause there's a plan, right?
I mean, uh, you making gourmet wieners isn't exactly the reason why you joined the CIA, and Casey isn't a natural-born appliance salesman, and the whole kind government-secrets-locked- in-my-brain thing, uh, that's, I'm sure, not really a boon for national security, so I'm hoping, I mean, I'm hoping that you'll tell me that there's a plan?
we have a plan.
there is somebody who can help.
we can discuss it further tonight.
how about another date? I can pick you up at 8: 00.
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds... I'd like that. That sounds great. I'll, uh, I'll see you.
Chuck is in.
send the doctor.
Hey, sis, what do you think of this shirt?
another date with Sarah. This is very exciting.
well, see, it's not that big a deal. -Yes, it is. Hey, she is hot.
Jeepers.
I'd go with the first shirt, too. It looks really nice with your skin tone.
Oh, yeah?
wait a minute-- Morgan has met her, and I haven't?
well... yeah, he confides in me, Ellie. You know?
he-he tells me his deepest, darkest secrets, which, you could, too, by the way.
here's one: I loath you.
that's not a secret.
I need to meet this girl. Tomorrow night. Dinner. Here.
a little too soon to be seeing the true poster, don't you think?
not exactly a natural aphrodisiac.
dinner. Perfect. I'll clear my schedule.
our most valuable secrets have been sent to an idiot.
well, at least they weren't sent to his friend.
operation Chuck.
I can't believe this.
I spoke with agent Walker.
she'll deliver Chuck to the rendezvous tonight.
good. Dr. Zarnow's on his way to L. A. now.
he is our best, NSA's top scientist.
well, I hope he can fix this.
get in.
wienerlicious really pays well, huh?
uh, what are we, uh, what are we doing? We're going to, uh, like, a movie or some dinner?
not exactly.
what, what does, what does "not exactly" mean, exactly?
so.
here we are on our date at the Buy More.
is this all part of the plan or a chance for me to clock in some overtime?
there's a doctor coming to see you, Chuck.
he worked on the encoding process for the intersect, the computer that Bryce destroyed, the one that's in your head.
he's coming to examine you.
Uh-huh, uh, and-and does this examination involve, say, I don't know, needles or perhaps probing of some kind?
the doctor is our best shot at helping you.
it's what you want, right?
to get the secrets out of your head.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
but you-you still... you're still being very vague about the probing, and I'd like to know the answer to that.
we've rewired the home theater room for this test.
when the images start, just say what they are.
that's it?
I'm sure you'll find a way to screw it up.
the doctor's here.
when do I get to meet him? -You don't.
it's important that he doesn't see you. You're too valuable.
Thanks. I'm flattered and totally freaked out.
Dr. Zarnow?
agent Casey.
agent Walker.
thank you for meeting us at a neutral site.
let's begin.
I don't understand why I can't see my patient.
for your safety, we're keeping patient x's identity a secret.
does patient x work here?
patient x--who knows all the intersect secrets--works in a Buy More?
ridiculous. Of course.
after the tone, the test will begin.
uh... dog.
uh, hippopotamus.
fat guy.
ugly building.
really beautiful woman at the beach.
cardinal one is the top Moscow spy in the white house office of...
the plot to assassinate president carter was orchestrated by...
northrop Davis voting computers has been approved by the DNC, RNC and CIA.
oceanic flight 815 was shot down by surface-to-air... work on subterranean...
beneath Denver international airport has reached phase four.
benedictine agents within the Vatican report...assassin still active...been approved by the DNC, RNC and CIA.
scenario five is... okay, well, that's just a picture of a turtle.
your patient is phenomenal.
we never imagined this.
what didn't you imagine?
one person seeing all the intersect images.
all our secrets in one mind.
can you remove the secrets, doctor?
Yes. I think I can.
so, did I pass the test?
you did great, Chuck.
and this doctor guy--he can fix me or...?
uh, he's hopeful, yeah.
okay.
Oh, uh, I almost forgot.
uh... dinner tomorrow night with my sister and her boyfriend captain awesome.
she really wanted to meet you.
okay, well, that's a good idea.
meeting the family is kind of a big step if our relationship were remotely real.
so, uh, if this whole examination thing, if it works out, then I guess...we're through, huh?
uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.
okay. Well, good night. -Good night.
Oh, and, uh... just so you know... um... tonight was probably the best... only second date I've been on in years.
drive safe.
did you see this?
at where?
did you know that Bryce was dead?
no. No, I didn't.
well, are you okay?
I don't know.
um... yeah, I don't know. It's crazy.
I, uh, I spent so much time hating him for getting me kicked out of Stanford,
I don't know, really, how to feel, but it's hard to be mad at him now.
I'm really sorry, Chuck.
Yeah, Casey. I'm at the scene.
no sign of Zarnow's body. Probably vaporized.
I guess those secrets are staying in Chuck's head.
well... no sign of anything here.
it looks like we're sending the good doctor home in an ashtray.
okay, well, I've got hot dogs to fry.
and I've got some toasters to sell.
feels like a CIA job to me.
keep your eye on agent Walker.
and don't let Chuck out of your sight. He could be next.
the strong bars are getting a little sticky. On... on one.
on the other one, it's fine, but on the second...
you can't trust her.
Chuck. John. -Big Mike. Big Mike!
how's customer service training?
fine. -Super.
glad to hear it.
the better my employees, the less I have to work.
very inspiring words, sir.
regular call to arms.
well, go make them better.
show me you're assistant manager material.
chop-chop! I got a napping an hour.
good-bye. -Good-bye.
so, uh, this is the hand-held scanner.
very expensive piece of equipment.
so is a stealth fighter and somehow I managed to fly that.
right, uh, and the gun, you know, kind of works like a...
gun? -Uh-huh.
and it beeps when you scan the barcodes.
well, if screamed out loud, I'd be right at home.
I don't want you to have any more private meetings with Sarah, hmm?
um, is there...is there a problem?
no problems, only solutions.
well, that... sounds very much like the Buy More customer policy that I've noticed you have some issue with.
now you know, uh... you know what I think we're going to do about that?
we're going to do some role-playing, and work on that attitude of yours how about that?
Hey, Morgan. -Hi, you.
Ah, hey, there he is. There's my Johnny-on-the-spot.
morgan and Casey, you guys are going to do some stuff.
you're going to be a shopper, and you're going to be the sales rep, like you are.
and, uh, I'm going to talk to big Mike and-and work on some stuff 'cause I know he's got other things in store.
got it from here.
there you go.
so, Chuck, no private meetings with Casey today.
what? What is it up with you guys?
did he tell you the same thing?
right, of course he did.
hold on a second. Is something wrong?
the doctor from last night-- he was killed in an explosion soon after he left us.
what-what?
the doctor who was supposed to fix me?
tell me what this is.
a... a nasty...
NSA incinerator.
special is sue designed to eliminate all biological traces.
that's what killed the doctor.
and guess who works for the NSA?
why... why, why would Casey... - He's a killer, Chuck.
it's what he does for a living.
he tried to kill us, and he'll probably try to do it again.
maybe it was orders.
maybe he didn't like the way Zarnow looked at him.
Oh, that's nice. I feel much better now, Sarah.
what am I supposed to do?
you go back in there and you pretend like you know nothing.
go. You can do that, Chuck.
I know nothing.
I know nothing, I... got it.
all right, so I'm going to try again. Ready?
do you have any Ramones?
no, don't say no. It's not going...listen, okay.
uh, excuse me, John. How you doing? Do you have any Ramones here, dude?
don't tell me you don't have any.
Casey, the...the correct response is "can we order you the Ramones?"
Ramones, man, Ramones. Okay, just looking for the Ramones, man.
do you have Ramones? 'Cause I love Ramones... ow!
that's a "no" on the Ramones, I guess.
okay, I don't think that's in the Buy More manual.
what did Sarah tell you?
I know you talked to her. It's what I do for a living.
Oh, no, here it is, on the bottom shelf: Ramones.
there you go. -Thanks.
Bye. -I love you.
what did you tell Chuck?
that you're a cold-blooded killer. Was I lying?
no.
the way I figure it, the only two people that knew the doctor was coming are right here.
since I didn't cap him, you're under arrest.
quick, take a pic.
she's so hot. Did you get it? Come on.
let's go put it on the internet.
Mr. Bartowski. -Hi Lester.
uh, code zebra.
linux install at a factory off vent era. 142 Euclid.
uh... I'm sorry. Why-why can't you and Jeff go?
linux, pcs? We're, uh, we're mac guys, Chuck. We're... we're it artists.
okay. Yeah. Uh... fine, whatever.
I'll be back in half an hour.
and, uh, just tell Casey that I'm on my cell.
you tell him. I'm not your servant.
okay, you know what... - no, no, I mean, I'm going to tell him.
I just, you know, I mean, in general, I don't always...
absolutely, I'm going to... right now, should I tell him?
Hello? -Pull over.
well, I can't pull over.
I have a home install at, uh... -142 Euclid?
guess who called that in?
Oh, my god. It was you!
you killed the doctor, and now you're here to kill me!
are you out of your mind?
what... what... what... what happened to you?
your girlfriend happened.
what, who, Sarah? -She's rogue, Chuck.
she killed the doctor, then she tried to kill me.
is she okay?
Yeah, I'm good. Thanks for asking.
no, no, no, why should I believe you?
she showed me the bomb. She said you did it.
NSA incinerator, right?
it's a nice explosive easily purchased on the black market.
what do you really know about Sarah, Chuck, huh?
think.
she's CIA.
she worked with Bryce.
he was rogue. Maybe she is, too.
she found you in L. A.
but she couldn't grab you because I was around.
so she had to wait her chance.
Dr. Zarnow screwed that up.
he could pull those secrets out of your head, then she loses the intersect, so she had to act fast.
let's go. Come on.
thought I turned that off.
well, it's not me. Is it yours?
no.
NSA incinerator! Run!
you're nervous cooking, babe. Relax.
Devon, this dinner has to go well.
it's going to be awesome. You don't know Chuck.
he freaks out when he likes a girl.
Yeah, isn't that the truth, huh?
you know practice makes perfect.
how did you get in here?
uh, Chuck's window.
or, as I like to call it, the Morgan door.
I got to lock the window. I wonder where Chuck is.
still think it was me?
why would Sarah do this?
she's cleaning the operation.
cleaning?
eliminating everyone she's come in contact with.
you know where she is?
we have to get back to my house. She's having dinner with us tonight.
no, kid, you're on the next plane to Washington.
but my sister... - doesn't have a super computer in her noggin.
you're the priority.
it's Casey. Put me through to general... hey!
Hey!
well, it's about time.
where have you been?
Why?
you, uh, you surprised to see me?
what?
Where's Casey? -I don't know.
maybe he's having some car trouble.
everyone okay?
Yeah, just a little hungry, dude. You're late.
and dirty for my taste.
and your girlfriend has been just nothing but mean to me.
look out for her.
so I'm glad everyone's getting along so well.
Yeah, your sister is awesome.
indeed.
Hey! I've got an idea.
why don't we actually go out, huh, for pizza or something, some place public, with lots and lots of people around?
uh, Chuck, I've been cooking all day.
Yeah, cooking pot roast, dude, which is my favorite.
Manzoom, Manjo. Let's eat.
sit down, okay? It'll be good.
lady. Looks great, baby.
this looks delicious, Ellie.
Oh, it was nothing.
so, Sarah, let's turn this up a notch personal style.
tell us something about yourself.
well, I'm originally from D. C. I just moved here.
Oh, Chuck had a friend from D. C.
a former friend.
you know, former because A: He was a jerk, and B: He's...well, he's dead.
the girl Chuck was dating before you-- he stole her.
Ugh, I just don't know how anyone could choose Bryce over Chuck.
Hi. I'm John Casey. I just moved in upstairs. I thought I might bring something over.
owe, come in.
Chuck, you didn't tell me you're bringing another friend.
Hey. Hi. Yeah.
it totally slipped my mind that my friend, John Casey, was coming over, and we work at Buy More together.
Morgan, you know John from Buy More.
I was telling him we were going to have a get-together and that, you know, the more, the merrier.
you pull a stunt like that again, I'll kill you before she can.
you kidder.
Chuck, we're going to need another chair.
okay okay.
you know what? I'm crashing the party. Maybe I should...I'll get it.
strange.
NSA ran a check on Sarah walker to see what we had... two years ago, she posed as a French diplomat.
infiltrated the inner circle of an arms deal.
killed the entire circle.
with a bomb?
we don't know.
her alias was Elana Truffaut.
they were poisoned.
at dinner. -Wonderful.
Hey, sis...chair. Ta-da!
So...thank you.
I mean, I knew that you had it in you, but she is... oh, she is...wow, she's really great.
Yeah. She's... unpredictable.
Hey, listen to me.
you have no reason to be nervous. Okay?
now, you have a great girl out there. I mean, she even made dessert.
dessert? -Yeah.
Oh, dessert. Dessert. Poison.
don't freak out.
stop!
we... uh, we didn't do a toast... yet.
which I... Which I'll do right now.
uh... so, I'd like to propose a toast. To my sister.
to my sister, and-and to... to a meal that looks so great.
and Devon, you're great.
and Sarah. And Sarah for a great dessert.
and to John Casey and-and his... and his...and his mini quiches, which are equally as great.
and what about me, Chuck?
for what?
and to Morgan for his great comic timing.
thank you, sir.
Cheers.
you're right, honey. I can't even resist.
wait! Wait! Wait! Wait.
who likes magic? -I do!
I know a trick.
Chuck... oh, Chuck, what are you doing?
voila!
whoa, Chuck, that was...I knew you could do it, man.
flame?
Chuck, look, no matter how stressed out you are, it is never okay to murder a woman's souffl?
um, you know what? Let me talk to him.
Casey, hey, maybe, uh...
tell me exactly Casey said.
nothing. Everything's okay.
make up sex. Nice.
what did he tell you?
that you killed Dr. Zarnow and poisoned a bunch of French diplomats.
they're blaming me for Zarnow?
if you're planning on hurting me, even to prove a point,
I think you should know I have a very low threshold for pain.
and you believe Casey?
tell me about the French diplomats.
they were French assassins, and they were after me, but I got to them first.
and you know what? I'm kind glad that I did.
Chuck, do you really think that my name is Sarah?
I never asked you to believe me. I asked you to trust me.
this doesn't make sense.
if Casey didn't kill Zarnow, then...
what are you doing?
I have to go right now.
uh, I'm sorry.
I have to go, but dinner was wonderful.
got to go. Be back.
Yeah, well, I better be going, too.
this has been great. Thanks.
uh... you're welcome.
I think that went well.
you know, not great, but I think it went well.
so, uh, I'm going to make a little doggy bag and head out my Morgan door.
how about that?
sounds good? Super-duper.
Sarah, wait!
you stay inside.
do what I say.
do you think we were wrong?
Hey, don't move.
good to see you again, agent Casey.
Oh, my god.
Yep, we were wrong.
Casey, he's got Sarah. We've got to save her.
brilliant deduction, Nancy Drew.
now pull out the tranq dart!
Oh, I have a very strong aversion to needles.
do it!
okay, uh, here we go.
that was the doctor, right? He's probably not dead?
and the sun sets in the west.
nothing gets by you.
one, two, three.
what's he going to do with Sarah?
he's going to torture her until she tells him all about you.
come on.
if we hurry, we can catch him.
I laced my quiches with microdots.
you're not kidding, are you?
I don't kid about quiche.
we can trace him using the car's tracker.
Yeah, I think that only comes with the sports package.
we made some enhancements when your car was in the shop.
got a signal.
let's go.
Hey, Casey, Casey.
wait a minute.
why, why would he bring Sarah here?
I don't know.
you wait here.
damn tranq dart.
come on.
Oh, god.
Hey, wait, you idiot!
it's Morgan.
he ate your quiches.
we're on the wrong trail.
come on.
I got nothing.
what do you mean you got nothing?
then what do we do?
it's over. She's gone.
no, no, no, no, no.
okay, this is our fault.
we didn't believe her.
now we have to save her.
look, if you were a bad guy, what would you do, fly Sarah out on a plane?
would you use a boator a-a-a what?
chopper.
small airfield near the water.
the closest I could find.
then do-do a satellite search using the touch screen and then maybe limit that to airfields that are within a certain range of us and then maybe limit that by if there's activity on the ground?
that's not bad.
Thanks.
Yeah, I was just kind of, you know, spitballing, just kind of top of my head.
I was thinking...found it.
port of Los Angeles.
floor it.
okay.
this is how this is going to work.
I'm going to go over there, rescue Sarah, and capture Dr. Zarnow, shoot anybody who gets in my way.
you, you're going to stay here.
so, in this plan I basically do nothing?
Yep.
let's do this.
all right, all right.
now we wait.
stay in the car.
stay in the car.
do not leave the car.
do not leave this car.
Sarah, are you okay?
what are you doing here?
stupid question.
okay, uh, should I...?
sorry.
Chuck, you have to get out of here.
no, I'm here to save you.
you shouldn't even be here, you're too valuable, and, besides, I have this well in hand.
Uh-huh, yeah, because it looks well in hand.
just find me something to pick this lock.
I don't... okay, here.
go, go, go!
the tape, the tape.
the helicopter's ready, agent Walker.
this is your last chance.
we're going to a special facility where they're going to torture you.
really torture, not this child's play.
or you could just tell me who is patient X.
something for the flight.
Oh, crap.
run!
Oh, crap.
I know you. I know your secret.
You-you've been feeding American science to North Korea for years.
Ah, patient X.
to think that my secrets are in that head of yours.
it's an honor, really.
of course, to hell with honor.
I'm here for the impressive dollar figure the human intersect will fetch.
who will I offer you to first?
don't worry, agent Walker.
I'll take good care of him.
no, Casey, don't shoot. They have Chuck.
proceed to bravo coordinates.
the ship will be waiting there.
it's about ten miles offshore.
15-minute flight.
don't move!
you must be kidding.
I want you to land the helicopter right now.
it's heavier than you thought.
what?
the gun.
it's heavy.
don't... don't!
give me back the gun.
I'm not giving you the gun!
you shot the pilot, you idiot!
I didn't mean to do that.
what's happening?
who's flying this thing?
you're going to kill us both.
come on, Chuck.
let me go.
get your hands off of me!
get off of me!
Oh, god.
that's a crane.
Oh, my god, Casey, I think Chuck's flying the chopper.
Yeah, I'm here.
I told you to stay in the car.
you know what? Forget about the car.
tell me how to fly a helicopter.
all right, there's a collective in the cyclic control.
what?
one's the stick. One looks like an emergency brake.
grab them both.
okay, okay, I got it.
this is not working!
push the stick just a bit forward while doing the same thing with the emergency brake.
ground-- not good.
pull up! Pull up!
pull up on the emergency brake!
level off. Level off!
I don't know how. I don't know how to level off!
listen, moron, you want to die?
Casey, put Sarah on the phone.
give me the phone, Casey.
here.
okay... uh, Chuck, you're going to be okay.
now, I need you to focus.
uh, have you ever played any flying games before?
flight Simulators? Yeah.
flight Simulators? Yeah, sure, I've done those, yeah.
okay, which ones?
uh, maverick of the skies... uh, stealth fighter elite...
uh, apache chopper patrol.
great.
okay, now remember that last one.
I want you to pretend like you're playing that game, okay.
you're just in your bedroom, you're playing a game, and none of this is real.
it's just a game.
it's just a game.
okay, I can do this.
I can play this game.
easy, Chuck, easy.
uh... uh, is this one of those helicopters that can turn into a boat?
no, it isn't.
just ease to the right and goose the brake.
they designed the game exactly like the helicopter.
I got it.
I got it.
almost there.
a little more to the right.
keeping right. Keeping right.
Goosinakthe brake.
it's just a game.
a big scary video game.
Oh, thank you, god!
Oh, yes!
you are wonderful.
and that is how...I do... that!
that's how we do that.
go, team. Sarah... See Sarah.
up top on that one.
palms are a little sweaty, but...
what the hell were you thinking?
clammy hands, got it, no good.
Chuck, the secrets that you know are incredibly important.
you compromised everything when you stopped trusting me.
and when you got out of the car.
listen, I'm... I'm sorry, okay?
no, it is not okay.
how could you think I was the double, huh?
you know, I am not Bryce.
Bryce betrayed everything that I believe in, and if you ever accuse me of that again, then I will walk away.
mission over. We all go back to Washington.
and you do not want that to happen, Chuck.
that you should trust me on.
way to go, ace.
dad's suit?
Yeah.
it's my only one.
I'm quite certain he wouldn't mind, though.
you realize that you don't have to go to Bryce's funeral.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
it's just we had a lot of history.
even if he did get me kicked out of school and steal my girlfriend.
well... you've moved on to bigger and better girls.
I don't really mean bigger like, literally bigger.
I just mean that, um... that I really like Sarah.
and I hope you guys work things out before the next dinner party, of course.
I don't know...I don't know, sis.
I... I... look, I really think I blew it.
Chuck, just try apologizing.
it goes a long way.
Sarah's special.
she's different from your Stanford friends.
he flew a helicopter?
your report was rather terrifying, major Casey.
do we really have the situation in hand, or should Mr. Bartowskibe in our care full-time?
well, you know how I feel, general.
but for now, we're in control.
then Chuck stays where he is.
but, uh, don't get too comfortable, Casey.
the new intersect will be up and running in six months.
and what happens to Chuck when this is done?
well, you'll do what you do best.
Hey, Chuck.
how is everything?
I saw you at the funeral.
Oh, yeah, I had to go.
after everything Bryce did, he was still my partner.
look, I'm not accusing you of anything... today.
yesterday, yes, I may have laid it on a little thick with the accusing.
but I'm really sorry about that.
instead of not trusting you, I should have been thanking you for saving my life and protecting the country and-and-and...
and making really tasty gourmet wieners.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
it was our first fight.
you know, it's a big step, if our relationship were remotely real.
you know, with Dr. Zarnowgone, Chuck, those intersect secrets aren't going anywhere.
that means more missions, more danger, more secrets that you can't tell your sister or your friends.
I know that.
some people want to be heroes and others have to be asked.
so... Chuck, are you ready?
good.
I hope we're no interrupting anything.
uh... by the way, I thought we'd give that dinner another shot, maybe here.
we knew you'd forgive him.
right, and you realize that you all have to eat my cooking.
give me the 411 on the corn dogs.
what do you think, man?
what do you recommend, buddy?
holy... okay.
Cheers.
Hi. My name's charles bartowski, but you can call me Chuck.
those are my shoes.
this is my life.
it's filled with spies, car chases, computer-stealing ninjas and me saving the day.
Oh, wait, wait. I'd have to go back.
I work at the Buy More.
it used to be pretty boring.
Chuck! Get overhere! Now!
look at this. What happened?
well, way to go, Jeff.
you do realize we don't work for Large Mart.
they're our competition.
can you imagine the shame if sommarge rt fiend or costco stoogeput out a display on our Buy More green?
so this has to come down, right?
yesterday.
I now present to you the magic... of Morgan.
this is my best friend, Morgan. He is not a magiCIAn.
voila!
see, everything changed when I got an e-mail from my old college buddy Bryce Larkin.
you see, Bryce had been working for the CIA when he stwhe a ole bunch of government secrets
big important secrets, really scary, nasty, get-killed-for-having-them secrets.
next thing I know, these ecpersrets are downloaded into my brain, which means every moment lf my life...is in danger.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
the NSA sent their top agent to protect me.
that's Casey. He's pretty scary.
so now I must defend the country from assassins...
no, Casey!
terrorists...
and shoplifters.
Casey, Casey, Casey. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. It's just a video game, okay?
lives are not in danger, and the country is still safe.
this guy's been here 24 hours and he's taking the job way more seriously than me.
that's because he's crazy.
tell me something I don't know.
Oh, hey, dawg. Nice to see you again, pal. Huh?
you're not so tough now, are you?
Oh, you don't like that, huh?
the CIA sent their top agent too.
Oh, yeah, I know. Believe me.
she told me to trust her.
but just like any woman, she's got a past.
and... she's posing as my girlfriend.
Sarah, what, uh... What are you doing here?
I work here now, Chuck.
Oh, damn.
I burned another batch.
why are you working here?
surveillance.
I can monitor the Buy More from here while you work.
it's just a cover.
right, yeah, a part of the plan. 'Cause there's a plan, right?
I mean, uh, you making gourmet wieners isn't exactly the reason why you joined the CIA, and Casey isn't a natural-born appliance salesman, and the whole kinda government-secrets-locked- in-my-brain thing, uh, that's, I'm sure, not really a boon for national security, so I'm hoping, I mean, I'm hoping that you'll tell me that there's a plan?
we have a plan.
there is somebody who can help.
we can discuss it further tonight.
how about another date? I can pick you up at 8: 00.
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds... I'd like that. That sounds great. I'll, uh, I'll see you.
Chuck is in.
send the doctor.
Hey, sis, what do you think of this shirt?
another date with Sarah. This is very exciting.
well, see, it's not that big a deal. -Yes, it is. Hey, she is hot.
Jeepers.
I'd go with the first shirt, too. It looks really nice with your skin tone.
Oh, yeah?
wait a minute-- Morgan has met her, and I haven't?
well... yeah, he confides in me, Ellie. You know?
he-he tells me his deepest, darkest secrets, which, you could, too, by the way.
here's one: I loath you.
that's not a secret.
I need to meet this girl. Tomorrow night. Dinner. Here.
a little too soon to be seeing the true poster, don't you think?
not exactly a natural aphrodisiac.
dinner. Perfect. I'll clear my schedule.
our most valuable secrets have been sent to an idiot.
well, at least they weren't sent to his friend.
operation Chuck.
I can't believe this.
I spoke with agent walker.
she'll deliver Chuck to the rendezvous tonight.
good. Dr. Zarnow's on his way to L. A. Now.
he is our best, NSA's top scientist.
well, I hope he can fix this.
get in.
wienerlicious really pays well, huh?
uh, what are we, uh, what are we doing? We're going to, uh, like, a movie or some dinner?
not exactly.
what, what does, what does "not exactly" mean, exactly?
so.
here we are on our date at the Buy More.
is this all partof the plan or a chance for meto clock in some overtime?
there's a doctor coming to see you, Chuck.
he worked on theencoding process for the intersect, the computer that Bryce destroyed, the one that's in your head.
he's coming to examine you.
Uh-huh, uh, and-and does this examination involve, say, I don't know, needles or perhaps probing of some kind?
the doctor is our best shotat helping you.
it's what you want, right?
to get the secretsout of your head.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
but you-you still... you're still being very vague about the probing, and I'd like to know the answer to that.
we've rewired the home theater room for this test.
when the images start, just say what they are.
that's it?
I'm sure you'll finda way to screw it up.
the doctor's here.
when do I get to meet him? -You don't.
it's important that he doesn't see you. You're too valuable.
Thanks. I'm flattered and totally freaked out.
Dr. Zarnow?
agent Casey.
agent Walker.
thank you for meeting us at a neutral site.
let's begin.
I don't understand why I can't see my patient.
for your safety, we're keeping patient x's identity a secret.
does patient x work here?
patient x--who knows all the intersect secrets--works in a Buy More?
ridiculous. Of course.
after the tone, the test will begin.
uh... dog.
uh, hippopotamus.
fat guy.
ugly building.
really beautiful woman at the beach.
cardinal oneis the top moscow spy in the white house office of...
the plot to assassinatepresident carter was orchestrated by...
northrop davis voting computers has been approved by the DNC, RNC and CIA.
oceanic flight 815 was shot down by surface-to-air... work on subterranean...
beneath denver international airport has reached phase four.
benedictine agents within the vatican report...assassin still active...been approved by the DNC, RNC and CIA.
scenario five is... okay, well, that'sjust a picture of a turtle.
your patient is phenomenal.
we never imagined this.
what didn't you imagine?
one person seeing all the intersect images.
all our secrets in one mind.
can you remove the secrets, doctor?
Yes. I think I can.
so, did I pass the test?
you did great, Chuck.
and this doctor guy--he can fix me or...?
uh, he's hopeful, yeah.
okay.
Oh, uh, I almost forgot.
uh... dinner tomorrow nightwith my sister and her boyfriend captain awesome.
she really wanted to meet you.
okay, well, that's a good idea.
meeting the family'skind of a big step if our relationship were remotely real.
so, uh, if this whole examination thing, if it works out, then I guess...we're through, huh?
uh, yeah. Mm-hmm.
okay. Well, good night. -Good night.
Oh, and, uh... just so you know... um... tonight wasprobably the best... only second dateI've been on in years.
drive safe.
did you see this?
at where?
did you know that Bryce was dead?
no. No, I didn't.
well, are you okay?
I don't know.
um... yeah, I don't know. It's crazy.
I, uh, I spent somuch time hating him for getting me kicked out of Stanford,
I don't know, really, how to feel, but it's hard to be mad at him now.
I'm really sorry, Chuck.
Yeah, Casey. I'm at the scene.
no sign of Zarnow's body. Probably vaporized.
I guess those secrets are staying in Chuck's head.
well... no sign of anything here.
it looks like we're sending the good doctor home in an ashtray.
okay, well, I've got hot dogs to fry.
and I've got some toasters to sell.
feels like a CIA job to me.
keep your eye on agent Walker.
and don't let Chuck out of your sight. He could be next.
the strong barsare getting a little sticky. On... on one.
on the other one, it's fine, but on the second...
you can't trust her.
Chuck. John. -Big Mike. Big Mike!
how's customer service training?
fine. -Super.
glad to hear it.
the better my employees, the less I have to work.
very inspiring words, sir.
regular call to arms.
well, go make 'em better.
show me you're assistantmanager material.
chop-chop! I got a napin an hour.
good-bye. -Good-bye.
so, uh, this is the hand-held scanner.
very expensive piece of equipment.
so is a stealth fighter and somehow I managed to fly that.
right, uh, and the gun, you know, kind of works like a...
gun? -Uh-huh.
and it beeps when you scan the barcodes.
well, if screamed out loud, I'd be right at home.
I don't want you to have any more private meetings with Sarah, hmm?
um, is there...is there a problem?
no problems, only solutions.
well, that... sounds very much like the Buy More customer policy that I've noticed you have some issue with.
now you know, uh... you know what I think we're gonna do about that?
we're gonna do some role-playing, and work on that attitude of yours how about that?
Hey, Morgan. -Hi, yo.
Ah, hey, there he is. There's my Johnny-on-the-spot.
morgan and Casey, you guys are gonna do some stuff.
you're gonna be a shopper, and you're gonna be the sales rep, like you are.
and, uh, I'm gonna talk to big Mike and-and work on some stuff 'cause I know he's got other things in store.
got it from here.
there you go.
so, Chuck, no private meetings with Casey today.
what? What is it up with you guys?
did he tell you the same thing?
right, of course he did.
hold on a second. Is something wrong?
the doctor from last night-- he was killed in an explosion soon after he left us.
Wha-what?
the doctor who was supposed to fix me?
tell me what this is.
a... a nasty...
NSA incinerator.
special is sue designed toeliminate all biological traces.
that's what killed the doctor.
and guess who works for the NSA?
why... why, why would Casey... - He's a killer, Chuck.
it's what he does for a living.
he tried to kill us, and he'll probably try to do it again.
maybe it was orders.
maybe he didn't like the way Zarnow looked at him.
Oh, that's nice. I feel much better now, Sarah.
what am I supposed to do?
you go back in there and you pretend like you know nothing.
go. You can do that, Chuck.
I know nothing.
I know nothing, I... got it.
all right, so I'm gonna try again. Ready?
do you have any Ramones?
no, don't say no. It's not gonna...listen, okay.
uh, excuse me, John. How you doing? Do you have any Ramones here, dude?
don't tell me you don't have any.
Casey, the...the correct response is "can we order youthe Ramones?"
Ramones, man, Ramones. Okay, just lookingfor the Ramones, man.
do you have Ramones? 'Cause I love Ramones... ow!
that's a "no" on the Ramones, I guess.
okay, I don't think that's in the Buy More manual.
what did Sarah tell you?
I know you talked to her. It's what I dofor a living.
Oh, no, here it is, on the bottom shelf: Ramones.
there you go. -Thanks.
Bye. -I love you.
what did you tell Chuck?
that you're a cold-bloodedkiller. Was I lying?
no.
the way I figure it, the only two people that knew the doctor was coming are right here.
since I didn't cap him, you're under arrest.
quick, take a pic.
she's so hot. Did you get it? Come on.
let's go put it on the internet.
Mr. Bartowski. -Hi Lester.
uh, code zebra.
linux install at afactory off ventura. 142 Euclid.
uh... I'm sorry. Why-why can't you and Jeff go?
linux, pcs? We're, uh, we're mac guys, Chuck. We're... we're it artists.
okay. Yeah. Uh... fine, whatever.
I'll be back in half an hour.
and, uh, just tell Casey that I'm on my cell.
you tell him. I'm not your servant.
okay, you know what... - no, no, I mean, I'm gonna tell him.
I just, you know, I mean, in general, I don't always...
absolutely, I'm going to... right now, should I tell him?
Hello? -Pull over.
well, I can't pull over.
I have a home install at, uh... -142 Euclid?
guess who called that in?
Oh, my god. It was you!
you killed the doctor, and now you're here to kill me!
are you out of your mind?
what... what... what... what happened to you?
your girlfriend happened.
what, who, Sarah? -She's rogue, Chuck.
she killed the doctor, then she tried to kill me.
is she okay?
Yeah, I'm good. Thanks for asking.
no, no, no, why should I believe you?
she showed me the bomb. She said you did it.
NSA incinerator, right?
it's a niceexplosive easily purchased on the black market.
what do you really know about Sarah, Chuck, huh?
think.
she's CIA.
she worked with Bryce.
he was rogue. Maybe she is, too.
she found you in L. A.
but she couldn't grab you because I was around.
so she had to wait her chance.
Dr.Zarnow screwed that up.
he could pull those secrets out of your head, then she loses the intersect, so she had to act fast.
let's go. Come on.
thought I turned that off.
well, it's not me. Is it yours?
no.
NSA incinerator! Run!
you're nervous cooking, babe. Relax.
Devon, this dinner has to go well.
it's going to be awesome. You don't know Chuck.
he freaks out when he likes a girl.
Yeah, ain't that the truth, huh?
you know practice makes perfect.
how did you get in here?
uh, Chuck's window.
or, as I like to callit, the Morgan door.
I got to lock the window. I wonder whereChuck is.
still thinkit was me?
why would Sarah do this?
she's cleaning the operation.
cleaning?
eliminating everyone she's come in contact with.
you know where she is?
we have to get back to my house. She's having dinner with us tonight.
no, kid, you're on the next plane to Washington.
but my sister... - doesn't have a super computer in her noggin.
you're the priority.
it's Casey. Put me through to general... hey!
Hey!
well, it's about time.
where have you been?
Why?
you, uh, you surprised to see me?
what?
Where's Casey? -I don't know.
maybe he's having some car trouble.
everyone okay?
Yeah, just a little hungry, dude. You're late.
and dirty for my taste.
and your girlfriend has been just nothing but mean to me.
look out for her.
so I'm glad everyone'sgetting along so well.
Yeah, your sister is awesome.
indeed.
Hey! I've got an idea.
why don't we actually go out, huh, for pizzaor something, some place public, with lots and lotsof people around?
uh, Chuck, I've been cooking all day.
Yeah, cooking pot roast, dude, which is my favorite.
Manzoom, Manjo. Let's eat.
sit down, okay? It'll be good.
lady. Looks great, baby.
this looks delicious, Ellie.
Oh, it was nothing.
so, Sarah, let's turn this up a notch personal style.
tell us something about yourself.
well, I'm originally from D. C. I just moved here.
Oh, Chuck had a friend from D. C.
a former friend.
you know, former because A: He was a jerk, and B: He'S...well, he's dead.
the girl Chuck was dating before you-- he stole her.
Ugh, I just don't know how anyone could choose Bryce over Chuck.
Hi. I'm John Casey. I just moved in upstairs. I thought I might bring something over.
ow, come in.
Chuck, you didn't tell meyou're bringing another friend.
Hey. Hi. Yeah.
it totally slipped my mind that my friend, John Casey, was coming over, and we work at Buy More together.
Morgan, you know John from Buy More.
I was telling him we were gonna have a get-together and that, you know, the more, the merrier.
you pull a stunt like that again, I'll kill you before she can.
you kidder.
Chuck, we're going to need another chair.
Okey dokey.
you know what? I'm crashing the party. Maybe I should...I'll get it.
strange.
NSA ran a checkon Sarah walker to see what we had... two years ago, she posed as a french diplomat.
infiltrated the inner circle of an arms deal.
killed the entire circle.
with a bomb?
we don't know.
her alias was Elana Truffaut.
they were poisoned.
at dinner. -Wonderful.
Hey, sis...chair. Ta-da!
So...thank you.
I mean, I knew that you had it in you, butshe is... oh, she is...wow, she's really great.
Yeah. She's... unpredictable.
Hey, listen to me.
you have no reason to be nervous. Okay?
now, you have agreat girl out there. I mean, she even made dessert.
dessert? -Yeah.
Oh, dessert. Dessert. Poison.
don't freak out.
stop!
we... uh, we didn't do a toast... yet.
which I... Which I'll do right now.
uh... so, I'd like topropose a toast. To my sister.
to my sister, and-and to... to a meal that looks so great.
and Devon, you're great.
and Sarah. And Sarah for a great dessert.
and to John Casey and-and his... and his...and his mini quiches, which areequally as great.
and what about me, Chuck?
for what?
and to Morgan for his great comic timing.
thank you, sir.
Cheers.
you're right, honey. I can't even resist.
wait! Wait! Wait! Wait.
who likes magic? -I do!
I know a trick.
Chuck... oh, Chuck, what are you doing?
voila!
whoa, Chuck, that was...I knew you could do it, man.
flame?
Chuck, look, no matter how stressed out you are, it is never okay to murder a woman's souffl?
um, you know what? Let me talk to him.
Casey, hey, maybe, uh...
tell me exactlyey Casey said.
nothing. Everything's okay.
make up sex. Nice.
what did he tell you?
that you killed Dr.Zarnow and poisoned a bunch of french diplomats.
they're blaming me for Zarnow?
if you're planning on hurting me, even to prove a point,
I think you should know I have a very low threshold for pain.
and you believe Casey?
tell me about the french diplomats.
they were french assassins, and they were after me, but I got to them first.
and you know what? I'm kinda glad that I did.
Chuck, do you really think that my name is Sarah?
I never asked you to believe me. I asked youto trust me.
this doesn't make sense.
if Casey didn't kill Zarnow, then...
what are you doing?
I have to go right now.
uh, I'm sorry.
I have to go, but dinner was wonderful.
gotta go. Be back.
Yeah, well, I better be going, too.
this has been great. Thanks.
uh... you're welcome.
I think that went well.
you know, not great, but I think it went well.
so, uh, I'm gonna make a little doggy bag and head out my Morgan door.
how about that?
sounds good? Super-duper.
Sarah, wait!
you stay inside.
do what I say.
do you think we were wrong?
Hey, don't move.
good to see you again, agent Casey.
Oh, my god.
Yep, we were wrong.
Casey, he's got Sarah. We've got to save her.
brilliant deduction, Nancy Drew.
now pull out the tranq dart!
Oh, I have a very strong aversion to needles.
do it!
okay, uh, here we go.
that was the doctor, right? He's probably not dead?
and the sun sets in the west.
nothing gets by you.
one, two, three.
what's he gonna do with Sarah?
he's gonna torture her until she tells him all about you.
come on.
if we hurry, we can catch him.
I laced my quiches with microbots.
you're not kidding, are you?
I don't kid about quiche.
we can trace him using the car's tracker.
Yeah, I think that only comes with the sports package.
we made some enhancements when your car was in the shop.
got a signal.
let's go.
Hey, Casey, Casey.
wait a minute.
why, why would he bring Sarah here?
I don't know.
you wait here.
damn tranq dart.
come on.
Oh, god.
Hey, wait, you idiot!
it's Morgan.
he ate your quiches.
we're on the wrong trail.
come on.
I got nothing.
what do you meanyou got nothing?
then what do we do?
it's over. She's gone.
no, no, no, no, no.
okay, this is our fault.
we didn't believe her.
now we have to save her.
look, if you were a bad guy, what would you do, fly Sarah out on a plane?
would you use a boator a-a-a what?
chopper.
small airfield near the water.
the closest I could find.
then do-do a satellite search using the touch screen and then maybe limit that to airfields that are withina certain range of us and then maybe limit that by if there's activity on the ground?
that's not bad.
Thanks.
Yeah, I was just kind of, you know, spitballing, just kind of top of my head.
I was thinking...found it.
port of Los Angeles.
floor it.
okay.
this is how this is gonna work.
I'm gonna go over there, rescue Sarah, and capture Dr.Zarnow, shoot anybody who gets in my way.
you, you're gonna stay here.
so, in this planI basically do nothing?
Yep.
let's do this.
all right, all right.
now we wait.
stay in the car.
stay in the car.
do not leave the car.
do not leave this car.
Sarah, are you okay?
what are you doing here?
stupid question.
okay, uh, should I...?
sorry.
Chuck, you have to get out of here.
no, I'm here to save you.
you shouldn't even be here;you're too valuable, and, besides, I have this well in hand.
Uh-huh, yeah,'cause it looks well in hand.
just find me something to pick this lock.
I don't... okay, here.
go, go, go!
the tape, the tape.
the helicopter's ready, agent Walker.
this is your last chance.
we're going to a special facility where they're going to torture you.
really torture, not this child's play.
or you couldjust tell me who is patient X.
something for the flight.
Oh, crap.
run!
Oh, crap.
I know you. I know your secret.
You-you've been feeding American science to North Korea for years.
Ah, patient X.
to think that my secrets are in that head of yours.
it's an honor, really.
of course, to hell with honor.
I'm here for the impressive dollar figure the human intersect will fetch.
who will I offer you to first?
don't worry, agent Walker.
I'll take good care of him.
no, Casey, don't shoot. They have Chuck.
proceed to bravo coordinates.
the ship will bewaiting there.
it's about ten miles offshore.
15-minute flight.
don't move!
you must be kidding.
I want you to land the helicopter right now.
it's heavier than you thought.
what?
the gun.
it's heavy.
don't... don't!
give me back the gun.
I'm not giving you the gun!
you shot the pilot, you idiot!
I didn't mean to do that.
what's happening?
who's flying this thing?
you're going to kill us both.
come on, Chuck.
let me go.
get your hands off of me!
get off of me!
Oh, god.
that's a crane.
Oh, my god, Casey, I think Chuck's flying the chopper.
Yeah, I'm here.
I told you to stay in the car.
you know what? Forget about the car.
tell me how to fly a helicopter.
all right, there's a collective in the cyclic control.
what?
one's the stick. One looks like an emergency brake.
grab 'em both.
okay, okay, I got it.
this is not working!
push the stick just a bit forward while doing the same thing with the emergency brake.
ground-- not good.
pull up! Pull up!
pull up on the emergency brake!
level off. Level off!
I don't know how. I don't know how to level off!
listen, moron, you want to die?
Casey, put Sarah on the phone.
give me the phone, Casey.
here.
okay... uh, Chuck, you're going to be okay.
now, I need you to focus.
uh, have you ever played any flying games before?
flight Simulators? Yeah.
flight Simulators? Yeah, sure, I've done those, yeah.
okay, which ones?
uh, maverick of the skies... uh, stealth fighter elite...
uh, apache chopper patrol.
great.
okay, now remember that last one.
I want you to pretend like you're playing that game, okay.
you're just in your bedroom, you're playing a game, and none of this is real.
it's just a game.
it's just a game.
okay, I can do this.
I can play this game.
easy, Chuck, easy.
uh... uh, is thisone of those helicopters that can turn into a boat?
no, it isn't.
just ease to the right and goose the brake.
they designed the game exactly like the helicopter.
I got it.
I got it.
almost there.
a little more to the right.
keeping right. Keeping right.
it's just a game.
a big scary video game.
Oh, thank you, god!
Oh, yes!
you are wonderful.
and that is how...I do... that!
that's how we do that.
go, team. Sarah... See Sarah.
up top on that one.
palms are a little sweaty, but...
what the hell were you thinking?
clammy hands, got it, no good.
Chuck, the secrets that you know are incredibly important.
you compromised everything when you stopped trusting me.
and when you got out of the car.
listen, I'm... I'm sorry, okay?
no, it is not okay.
how could you thinkI was the double, huh?
you know, I am not Bryce.
Bryce betrayed everything that I believe in, and if you ever accuse me of that again, then I will walk away.
mission over. We all go back to Washington.
and you do not want that to happen, Chuck.
that you should trust me on.
way to go, ace.
dad's suit?
Yeah.
it's my only one.
I'm quite certain he wouldn't mind, though.
you realize that you don't have to go to Bryce's funeral.
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
it's just we had a lot of history.
even if he did get me kicked out of school and steal my girlfriend.
well... you've moved on to bigger and better girls.
I don't really mean bigger like, literally bigger.
I just mean that, um... that I really like Sarah.
and I hope you guys work things out before the next dinner party, of course.
I don't know...I don't know, sis.
I... I... look, I really think I blew it.
Chuck, just try apologizing.
it goes a long way.
Sarah's special.
she's different from your Stanford friends.
he flew a helicopter?
your report was rather terrifying, major Casey.
do we really have the situation in hand, or should Mr. Bartowskibe in our care full-time?
well, you know how I feel, general.
but for now, we're in control.
then Chuck stays where he is.
but, uh, don't get too comfortable, Casey.
the new intersect will be up and running in six months.
and what happens to Chuck when this is done?
well, you'll dowhat you do best.
Hey, Chuck.
how is everything?
I saw youat the funeral.
Oh, yeah, I had to go.
after everything Bryce did, he was still my partner.
look, I'm not accusing youof anything... today.
yesterday, yes, I may have laid it on a little thick with the accusing.
but I'm really sorry about that.
instead of not trusting you, I should have been thanking you for saving my life and protecting the country and-and-and...
and making really tasty gourmet wieners.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.
it was our first fight.
you know, it's a big step, if our relationship were remotely real.
you know, with Dr.Zarnowgone, Chuck, those intersect secrets aren't going anywhere.
that means more missions, more danger, more secrets that you can't tell your sister or your friends.
I know that.
some people want to be heroes and others have to be asked.
so... Chuck, are you ready?
good.
I hope we're no tinterrupting anything.
uh... by the way, I thought we'd give that dinner another shot, maybe here.
we knew you'd forgive him.
right, and you realize that you all have to eat my cooking.
give me the 411 on the corn dogs.
what do you think, man?
what do you recommend, buddy?
holy... okay.
Cheers.
what the...?
whoa, whoa, whoa.
where do you think you're going?
I mean, you just don't think I can let you...
excuse me?
Yeah.
is there a trick to getting some help around here?
other then being charming and beautiful, no, ma'am.
I need to know which of these to buy.
the 3000-Z or the 3000-Z-X -Excellent question.
uh, you need to talk to one of our green shirts about that.
I can actually call one to assist you.
I'm not a salesman. I'm actually part of the Nerd Herd.
you must be so proud of yourself.
I wouldn't go so far as to say proud.
hello.
so sorry.
one einute. - Excuse me?
sir? - I'll be right back.
mystery Crisper.
guys, sorry, sorry to break up...
you want in? It's gonna cost you five bucks.
what's going on?
final round. Mystery Crisper.
mystery Crisper! Mystery Crisper!
the great Crisper, where employee food goes to die.
guys, there's going to be a riot on the sales floor if you don't get back to work.
come to Daddy.
he's got it?
he's the man, the man.
Ooh... Yeah.
he wants his weapon.
morgan is so awesome.
he can eat anything.
Bartowski. - Yeah! Yes!
I need to see you in my office.
I-I was just on my way.
daddy mad, Chuck. Daddy mad.
might as well kiss that promotion good-bye.
get in here, Bartowski. - Yes, sir.
tell me...
what's the best part of being Buy More brass?
the power?
the money?
the ladies?
the medical.
I couldn't give a rodent's behind about this job.
but this...
my body is my temple.
and I must treat it as such.
is that... is that all, sir?
cause I-I really should, uh, get back to work.
no, that is not all. Sit down.
okay.
there's a guy coming in here from corporate to interview you and Tang for the assistant manager spot.
now Tang's has the charm of a prostate exam.
for some reason, people seem to like you.
if the HR guy likes you, the job is yours.
so is the medical.
don't screw up.
I'll, uh, I'll do my best.
make sure Morgan does his best, too.
that kid is gonna be the anchor around your neck, Bartowski.
what, we don't have enough actual cobwebs already?
I'm getting ready for our annual Halloween party.
what time are you getting here?
Oh, you know what, I might be late.
they finally scheduled that promotional-interview thing for that afternoon.
we can just make it an assistant manager party, too, then.
sure, yeah, if you feel like jinxing it.
you're just finally growing up, aren't you?
excuse me, but what's wrong with our costume?
um, I'm sorry, but the whole two-man-sea-cucumber-thing is kind of creepy.
first of all, it's a sandworm, okay?
Shai-Hulud, to be specific.
and second of all, Dune fans have been going nuts over our costume since the eighth grade.
yo. Chuckster.
guess what I am?
you're... naked?
I'm Adam.
you know, like Adam and Eve, Adam.
wait till you see my snake.
I don't want to see your snake.
Devon, Chuck here has an interview on Wednesday.
that is outstanding.
I gotta... Excuse me. Hello?
Hello?
I'm getting tense!
you know I don't like being tense.
how can I help you relax, Big Mike?
find that jackass Morgan.
your buddy's supposed to be working a double shift today and went AWOL.
Hey, hey, buddy, Morgan.
where you been? What's up, buddy? - Yes.
where have you been? I've been trying to call you.
I, uh, I picked up the sandworm costume from the dry cleaners.
the ranch dressing from last year totally came out, so we're all good.
you ready to win another Buy More costume contest?
no. No, no,'cause you're supposed to be at work, buddy.
this guy's been handing me my ass all week.
time to return the favor.
Counsidered Dangerous - Uh, Morgan. - Yeah, buddy?
Morgan, this guy is dangerous.
well, Morgan's dangerous, Chucky.
Morgan's dangerous.
Oh, what a baby.
what a loser.
how did you find me? How did you find me?!
who else knows I'm here? Who do you work for?
no one. No one. Let me go.
look, I don't know what you're talking about.
I know you're a spy!
your watch? I designed that watch for the CIA.
are there other agents waiting for me outside?
are there other agents waiting for me outside?!
ah-hah!
you're not sneaking away from me.
wait, whoa, whoa.
you still owe me ten bucks!
whoa, hey, you still owe me ten dollars!
Hey.
um, is Sarah here?
she's waiting in your room.
is everything okay? - Said she had a surprise for you.
get in there, slugger.
Hey.
who is this Lazslo character? He just ID'd me as an agent.
relax. We're looking into him. And you did the right thing.
I... I didn't do anything. I just flashed on the guy.
you followed protocol, and I'm going to check in with you first thing in the morning.
wait, wait. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
wait, um...
look, if it's cool with you, could you hang out for a little while?
look, Awesome and Ellie think that I'm...
kind of getting lucky in here, and I wouldn't want to disappoint them.
Oh.
um...
uh, how long do you want me to stay?
42 minutes and 15 seconds?
arcade Fire's first album.
it's like an auditory aphrodisiac.
you're not really ready for it yet. Uh...
here we go. And...
why were you waiting for me in my room, anyway?
well, I wanted to surprise you.
um...
uh, it's, uh, it's us at Comic-Con.
what do you think?
it's... it's great.
but we've never actually been to Comic-Con, have we?
wow, we... we actually look like a real couple.
well, we are a real couple.
we're just a different sort of a couple.
that we are.
you!
what do I have to do to get timely intel out of you, Bartowski?
look, I briefed Sarah last night, all right?
Oh, I bet you did, slugger.
I thought we were all supposed to be part of the same team here, huh-- Team Chuck.
we are, but I'm starting to feel like the guy who always gets picked last, and I do not like feeling like Team Chuck's little fat kid.
okay, you know what, the next time I have a flash,
I'll come straight to you, all right, Casey?
what did you tell Lazslo?
Nothang.
he asked me where I got my watch, and I told him my girlfriend gave it to me, okay?
so you compromised yourself and Agent Walker?
bang up job, Chuck.
and so now you and your son are ready to video-chat. Oh!
thank you, young man.
you've been
great heavens!
this is a whale-tail.
notice this illusive creature, seen here frolicking in her natural habitat
any sudden movement would
give me, give me this.
come on, come on. Hey.
get, shoo, shoo, shoo.
have fun, go find the video games.
what was that about, man?
come on, I was this close to closing a sale.
no. You know what you are, Morgan?
you are this close to getting fired for sexual harassment.
what happened, Chuck?
you used to be cool.
I-I used to be cool?
when was that? When we were 13?
well, I'm sorry to go changing on you, buddy.
but if you hadn't noticed, we are now chronologically-speaking, adults.
so, unless you wanna work retail for the rest of your life, and by the way, drag me down with you in the process,
I would suggest that you grow up.
heavy is the head that wears the crown.
couldn't help，but notice the way you handled that, uh,
morgan situation.
that was most impressive, Chuck.
that's great, that's great.
you gave me goose bumps. - Super, Jeff.
the Intersect was correct to alert us.
we've been looking for Lazslo Mahnovski since he escaped from Los Robles National Labs last month.
who is he? - Weapons designer. Government brain.
the target graduated college age 14.
ph.d. at 17.
been with us ever since, working for a clandestine engineering subcontractor.
Lazslo's not the kind of asset we can afford to lose to our enemies.
grade-a egghead. Got it.
what do you want me to do with him?
bring him in. And take caution.
what, is he gonna hurt me with his mind?
well, here's what he did to his handlers.
Oh.
nice try, buddy, but, uh, Halloween's tomorrow, okay?
or today, or today.
it could be today if you want it to be today.
I didn't kill anybody.
look, I-I never said you did.
then why am I on the FBI list?
I don't know. Just calm down.
I was framed, okay.
you have to believe me. I am not a murderer.
okay, okay.
I believe you.
you told the undercover agent about me, didn't you?
he's talking to Pentagon operations right now.
I tapped into the encrypted video feed at the store.
I helped design that home theater system.
look, I-I-I don't know
gun!
get it.
I got it, I got it.
I got it.
is that a water gun?
no.
I'm pretty sure it's dripping on my face.
I'm sorry.
name's Lazslo.
and I need help.
what the hell am I supposed to do?
you're on the inside.
you have access.
look, unless you help me clear my name, they're gonna keep chasing me.
you're my only hope.
but first...
I could really use some pancakes.
Hey, where's Chuck?
shouldn't you guys be practicing your snake dance?
it's a sandworm, and... Oh.
Chuck's not here, cause he's probably off doing something really mature like seeing an opera.
or reading.
come on, babe, let's help the little guy out.
what else did you make for the CIA?
whatever the jobs called for actually.
I mean, if an agent wanted thermal-vision Ray Bans or he wanted a parachute disguised as a backpack,
I'm the guy they call.
you're like a real-life Q?
you know.
you know Q.
the guy who used to make all the gadgets for Bond, Q?
bond was that spy-guy, right?
what, have they been keeping you in a friggin' cave?
underground lab actually.
for the last 10 years,
all I did was work in that lab pretty much.
well, that and play video games.
but, uh...
no friends, no family.
no Bond.
no wonder you blew up all your research and busted out there.
that's just inhumane.
so what kind of work do you do?
you know, it's kinda, it's kinda, uh, complicated.
right, but you gotta be some kind of a genius.
or prodigy?
I mean feds don't bother recruiting somebody, guarding them with undercover agents,
what are you super-good at?
let's just say I'm a computer-guy.
Ellie, let me ask you a question.
am I the kind of person you'd categorize as...
immature?
do you really want me to answer that?
Yes.
be straight with me.
fire away both barrels.
would you mind stepping in the kitchen for a moment, Morgan?
I'll handle this one, honey.
Ellie's room.
Wow!
there comes a time in every man's life when he reaches, well, a crossroads.
a time when he must ask himself...
am I a tucker?
talking about your shirt, Morgan.
I wasn't always a tucker, you know.
then one day, it just happened.
how do you, how do you know it's time?
you just feel it. Go ahead.
tuck her in. See how she feels. - I don't know.
no, I'm, I'm just kinda happy with how my shirts hang there.
come on.
you're safe in here.
um...
tuck her in. - I don't if I'm, - I...- Do it.
I don't know, I-I kinda feel like my, my junk's out there for the whole world to see.
maybe that's the point, Morgan.
maybe that's the point.
if there's one thing to being a man, it's always speaking your mind.
whatever the cost. Always be direct, open and honest.
when I was 12, I hid under Ellie's bed, so I could watch her undress.
excellent.
what are you looking at?
your hair.
it's time to tame the mane, buddy.
let's talk product.
I gotta finish the job.
I'm sorry.
Hey, who's that handsome guy in the mirror?
this is great.
I mean just being able to sit in a coffee shop and talk.
just talk.
with somebody who knows what it's like working for the company.
you know, if I had to do it over again,
I never would have gone to that pier.
what pier?
I was 11...
and...
some agent saw me playing Tetris at an arcade.
so he asked me if I can take all these tests.
the next thing I know, he's offering to pay my way through school.
my parents, like, they didn't know what to do with a kid whose IQ is higher than both theirs combined.
so they signed me over.
and that's when I became property of the United States government.
sweet story, huh?
I'm a little, I'm a little strapped.
um...
you know how government work pays.
dude, yeah.
no, no, no, no, don't even worry about it.
here. Here's an IOU.
Thanks.
Chuck, listen you can't tell your handlers you ever saw me.
what? Why?
they can help you, Lazslo.
they're the good guys.
there's no such thing in this business.
I mean, you don't believe me?
go home and search your room.
see what kind of bugs your good guy handlers planted on you.
from now on, you should trust your handlers precisely as much as they trust you.
what the hell are these?
seems you already know, Chuck.
I can't believe you've been prying into my most intimate moments...
you know what? I swear to God, if I find out you've been spying on my sister,
I will kill you, Casey.
intimate moments?
not really an issue thus far.
at least, not in the sense of traditional two-person intimacy.
He-he-he.
do you have any idea how violated I feel right now?
you feel violated?
no, no, no, my ears feel violated.
cause they have to listen to you and that moron Morgan yammering on for four hours about what sandwich you're gonna take if you were stranded on a deserted island.
what are you nuts?
nobody was talking about sandwiches for four hours.
come on.
think about it
this is a desert island, Morgan.
mayonnaise simply doesn't fare well in the tropics
Oh, yeah, but define sandwich.
cause technically you can put anything between two slices of bread.
for instance, could I bring...
a Jessica Alba sandwich to said desert island?
I-I suppose.
well, I'll have you know, I stand by my mayonnaise theory.
and you're still a giant douche for spying on me like that.
well, if it's any comfort, Chuck, we planted those bugs to protect you.
how did you find the surveillance, anyway?
Oh, a little birdie named Lazslo told me.
what? You contacted Lazslo and didn't tell me?
I'm sorry, Casey.
did I violate your trust?
Willkommen to Wienerlicious.
I'm sorry, but we're geschlossen
and that's German for closed.
that's really adorable.
nice cover, Agent Walker.
you have a sec?
Hello, Chuck.
what did you tell your handler?
I told him you were innocent, okay?
I told him, I thought you were innocent.
and I think the best thing for you to do is go and turn yourself in.
they can help you.
forget it, Chuck.
it doesn't even matter.
of course it matters. Isn't this what you wanted?
they went through the trouble of framing me for murder.
what's going to happen when they get me back?
a slap on the wrist?
there's got to be someplace you can hide me.
just for tonight.
there is one place.
so this kid just escaped?
look, we tried everything we could to prevent this whole thing from happening.
and what exactly is this?
a mentally unstable weapons designer, off his meds, and currently running around Los Angeles.
and how do you know all this?
Lazslo was my asset.
I was the one who found him.
I was the one who trained him, and I'm definitely the one who's going to be bringing him back.
look, I'm just going to be completely straight with you, Walker.
we believe that he is looking to make a bomb.
and God help whoever's in his way when Lazslo decides to go off.
welcome to Buy More.
how can I be able of assistance?
this is great!
I'll be out before you guys open.
and if everything works out, you will never see me again.
thank you,
Chuck, for everything.
I really appreciate it.
Yeah, definitely. Good luck disappearing, Lazslo.
Yeah.
Oh, and I hope you don't mind,
I kind of helped myself to the... hold on...
the Bond ouevre.
Oh, check you out.
what? A View to a Kill?
that's a bold choice.
Why? Is it a good one?
Oh, dude, Christopher Walken playing some evil Nazi villain?
grace Jones as some a 'roid rage sex assassin?
I think, actually, on second thought, - I'm going to stay for the beginning. So... - Sit.
who is it?
uh, it's my handler, Sarah.
Chuck, you got to turn it off.
please, Chuck, she could be tracking us.
you don't understand. If you turn me in to your handlers, it's like signing my death warrant.
give me your watch.
Why? - Give me your watch.
I need to disable the transponder.
disable the transponder? - Transponder.
Yeah, but how would you do that?
here you go.
you were right about the bugs, by the way.
God knows what they put in my car.
I've got a pretty good idea.
I broke into it earlier, disabled the GPS system.
how did you...?
you designed my car.
just think, Chuck.
right now, there is no one in the entire world who knows where we are.
come on, Chuck. Pick up the phone.
Hey, it's Chuck. I'll call you right back.
damn it.
Chuck, I want you to go to your car, lock the doors and wait for me.
what did I tell you?
Max Zorin is one of the greatest bad guys of all time.
you think Walken was the bad guy?
what, are you kidding?
I mean, he did try to sink California into the Pacific Ocean.
what do you think?
don't you get it, Chuck?
Zorin is like us.
the Nazis used him for his superior gifts the way our government uses me and you.
I don't... - Too bad Zorin didn't have this home theater system.
screw flooding Silicon Valley.
do you know what we can do with this system if we really wanted to, Chuck?
watch more movies?
I haven't had a chance to play with this bad boy since I designed it.
what is that?
strategic Air Command.
we keep a fleet of B-2s in Guam, kept on nuclear alert, just in case.
training exercise terminated.
what are you doing?
Initiating... Putting my tax dollars to work, Chuck.
would you like to play a nice game of thermonuclear war?
what about Texas?
what did Texas ever do that was so great?
calculate flight plan 9 hours, 32 min, 15 sec
nine hours...
maybe we should pick somewhere closer?
in honor of Max Zorin...
let's see how fast they get to San Francisco.
destination
Hey, hey, hey!
um...
what about, let's watch Goldfinger, huh?
what's it about?
uh, again, it's about this bad, misunderstood ...
guy who just wants to blow up the world.
it's right up your alley; I think you'll really like it.
we can always play later.
we can!
we can play...
bomb, bomb, bomb...
thing later... I'm going to go get us some more popcorn.
so, here, why don't you...
you go ahead and start without me.
and-and, uh, I'm going to be right back.
you have 34 new messages.
Chuck, it's Casey. Call me.
you think this is funny, Chuck?
if you don't call me back in the next ten seconds, I'm going to...
tie it in a knot and shove it straight up your...
Chuck, I want you to go to your car, lock the doors, and wait for me.
where are we headed?
I thought I asked you to turn your phone off.
who were you talking to?
my handler, okay?
she was just checking in.
you shouldn't have done that, Chuck.
you should not have dragged them into this.
I'm not responsible for what happens now.
you sold me out... You sold me out!
no, no, no, no. I just didn't want you to get hurt, okay?
look, relax. Just relax, everything is going to be cool.
everything is not going to be cool.
come on, let's go.
what the hell?
Ow!
you're going to kill us! You're going to kill us!
it's been fun.
don't...
Oh... oh!
ladies.
Hey.
you look nice.
Thanks.
I feel like crap.
I screwed up.
I severely pooched the Lazslo situation last night.
Yeah, well...
today, you have a job interview.
do you think I care about making lower management at a Buy More?
are you kidding me?
I aided and abetted the escape of the next Ted Kacyzski, Sarah.
I just...
I can't believe that I was so wrong about that guy.
no wonder you bugged my room.
I'm an absolute idiot.
you know, just because you trust people, it doesn't make you an idiot.
Yeah, well, I should've trusted you guys a little more.
I'm sorry.
well, Casey got a signal on your car, and somehow the GPS got turned back on and last that was heading east.
so, I'll call you from the road.
and don't worry, we're going to bring him in, Chuck.
good luck today.
I don't know who you're supposed to be, but that's the most kick-ass costume ever.
I'm sorry, Michael. Is it Halloween?
I didn't realize.
Morgan, hey.
you up for a little Mystery Crisper holiday edition?
I'm sure I have no idea what you're talking about, Lester.
Hey, Morgan, buddy, where were you this morning?
I thought you wanted a ride in.
why are you all dressed up?
why are you all dressed up?
I have a job interview today.
bully for you, Chuck.
what?
you think you're the only one at the Buy More who cares about looking professional?
typical.
I never, I never said anything...
Boo! - Aah!
cause I'm about ready to kill me a job interview, partner.
Ka-pow!
Lazslo is not headed east.
he's going to the Santa Monica Pier.
Yeah, you don't say?
we just found the GPS in downtown.
Lazslo ripped it out and stuck it under a big rig.
look, he was casing the arcade.
it's where he was first recruited.
there's a huge Halloween party there every year.
I think he's going to blow it up.
where do you think you're going?
um...
it's you. Hey, hey, Big Mike, I...
can I... Can I borrow another herder?
all the herders are out.
you've got an interview this afternoon, or did you forget?
no. I-I just... I'm...
something came up.
is that something more important than being assistant manager?
is it more important than handing over your promotion to Tang?
please, Chuck. Is it more important than Big Mike's relaxation?
look, Big Mike, there are just some things in life that are more important than the Buy More.
you mean, like fishing and Danish?
excuse me.
I beg your pardon.
excuse me, you-you in the Gordon Gecko costume.
have you seen Chuck Bartowski?
it's time for his interview.
I actually don't know where Chuck's been keeping himself these days.
So-Sorry.
I guess your boyfriend just couldn't take the heat, huh?
I'm sure he's got a perfectly good excuse.
sure he does.
first Chuck bails on you and your stupid space-penis costume.
and then, he doesn't even have the stones to show up for his interview.
what a loser.
even by your standards.
if I were you,
I'd start interviewing for a new best friend,
Ma-Ma-Ma...
let me ask you something.
what do you know about Chuck Bartowski?
you're not Bartowski.
actually, I'm-I'm here to interview on my friend's behalf.
look... - Please, please, just hear me out, okay?
I know that the virtues that make for a good Buy More manager are the same virtues that make for a best friend.
now, uh, Chuck and I may have our differences, but I can tell you this about him.
Chuck is-is brave.
Chuck is loyal.
you know, Chuck can quote Wrath of Khan word-for-word.
and Chuck is courageous.
Chuck's got a wicked vinyl collection, and Chuck has the wisdom to not eat garbage from the break room crisper.
if you want my open and honest and direct opinion, the best man for this job is a man by the name of Chuck Bartowski.
some speech.
Chuck Bartowski sounds like a hell of a guy.
he is.
when he comes in tomorrow, he'll be working for one...
Harold Tiberius Tang.
God help you all.
I meant to tell you earlier about your car's self-destruct function.
one of my more inspired designs.
Lazslo, listen.
relax, Chuck.
she's all yours.
what did you just do?
you just armed a bomb.
that would have taken me hours to get through the fingerprint recognition system.
why are you doing this?
what? Blowing stuff up?
that's what bad guys do, Chuck.
besides, how else was I going to punish them for what they did to me.
yeah?
Hey, someone just armed the herder to sedf-destruct.
Yeah.
I know.
it was me.
disarm the bomb right now! - You disarm the bomb!
how? - It's easy.
cut the wire.
which one?
the red one.
you got to cut a wire, Chuck!
what if I cut both of them?
Oh, like Sean Connery in the end of Goldfinger?
what did you just say?
cut the wire, Chuck.
the other night, you said you'd never seen Goldfinger, so, how would you know what Bond does at the end of the movie?
cut the wire, or we're dead.
you lied to me, Lazslo.
you knew I'd believe you when you said you just wanted to live a normal, peaceful life.
and you knew that I'd believe you about cutting the wire, but you were wrong, Lazslo.
wait! Wait! Stay back! - Cut the red wire, Chuck!
you're under arrest.
come on.
Hey.
I liked it a little bit, all right?
all right, now, how do I...?
Hey, Chuck.
nice costume, Chuck.
and what are you supposed to be?
Oh, that's right.
you're my employee.
aren't you going to congratulate me?
you did hear I got the job.
uncontested.
Yeah. Nice work, Harry.
anyhow, now that you're here,
I wanted to talk to you about some organizational ideas I had for the Nerd Herd...
Chuck, where are you going?
Chuck, I will not be ignored!
did Morgan ever find you?
I thought the guy was going to lose it.
no. I-I know.
he was really looking forward to the Buy More costume contest.
I'm talking about what he did for you.
giving the whole big speech to try to talk the HR guy into giving you the job?
morgan did that?
and then someone went and stole his bike.
I mean, what kind of loser would steal a guy's bike?
look at you two.
I didn't think you were coming.
I'm sorry.
I got held up.
listen, Morgan, I think you should be the head this year.
Really?
Chuck, honey? Honey? - He's in the back.
Ah!
Hey.
how did it go?
uh, the short version is that I didn't get the job.
what? - I kind of skipped out on the interview.
it was my fault.
Hel-lo.
I, uh... I had a personal emergency, and Chuck really came through.
he probably wouldn't admit it, but your brother is kind of a hero.
would you excuse us?
Hey, uh, buddy, you mind if... you mind if we take a little five minute break?
dude, are you kidding me? Take ten if you need it.
so, uh, where did you get the costume?
the CIA can make anything.
what are you... What are you doing?
uh... smile.
smile.
I, uh... I wanted to give you a new photo of us, and I figured that it should be something ...
real. - Chuck!
they're calling for the worm, bro.
I'll, uh... I'll see you outside.
what were you guys, uh...
what were you guys talking about?
Oh, nothing.
just, uh, you know.
Sarah was just telling me that if she were stranded on a desert island, she would bring roast beef.
she didn't say roast beef. - Oh, she totally...
she completely said roast beef. - Oh, that's terrible.
Oh, that's a terrible sandwich, it's a terrible sandwich.
you know, she's smart, and she's sexy, and kudos on her costume, looked fantastic, but who brings roast beef to a deserted island?
that's a terrible choice.
she's hurt!
someone call 911!
stand back. I'm a doctor.
all right, sweetie. Okay.
she may have broken some ribs.
anybody know her parents?
all right, I'm gonna take her to the hospital.
help me get her up.
easy. Easy. That's it. It's okay, sweetie.
good luck.
that really hurt.
I think I sprained my wrist.
well, it's just a flesh wound, darling.
I can take you to the hospital, or I can get you some Rocky Road?
choice is yours.
rocky Road.
so, how much we get?
want to count it?
five and ten makes 20. Thank you.
have a nice day.
long day?
boring day.
well, not sure if it's the excitement that you're looking for, but, uh, you want to come over tonight for a fake date with Awesome and Ellie?
I promise fake cuddling, but real pizza.
I'm sorry, Chuck.
I- I have plans.
is there a mission tonight?
I- I don't remember getting the memo.
uh, no.
no mission. Just plans.
of course. Plans.
like any other single28-year-old spy with an evening to herself would have.
I'm sorry, Chuck, but it's personal.
so, uh, ready for the big mission tonight?
what mission? -You don't have to play games, okay?
I know. You and Sarah - Super Secret Mission.
there's no mission, moron.
she's taking a personal day.
I didn't realize we got personal days.
well, you don't. We do.
any idea what she's up to?
well?
it's personal.
what do you think you're doing?
giving us a little privacy so we can hook up.
come here. Come on.
Morgan! No!
I'm sick of hooking up only at work.
Ah, I'd love to go someplace else, but where?
my mother's always home, you have three roommates.
I mean, I'm open to suggestions.
Really?
good! Here.
the Buena Burbank Apartments.
they have really cute one bedrooms.
see, I can't afford this.
we could together.
we're ready to take the next step.
we...
that's, um...
that's a very big step, you know, and I think that it's not something that you should rush into.
I think that it's something you should discuss.
I mean, look at this place, all right?
72-inch plasma, super comfy couches, all the free coffee we can drink.
I mean, come on, baby. We are living the dream.
whose dream, Morgan?
everyone's.
Hey, Chuck, you ever wonder if you're not man enough to hang onto your woman?
I need a Nerd Herder.
no. Emmett found Jeff's underwear in the back seat, and he's having them all reupholstered as a safety precaution.
okay, Morgan, I need to borrow your bike.
sure. Yeah, sure. Why?
it's personal.
plans, huh?
how old is this guy?
let's eat.
uh, excuse me just a moment.
Yes, I-I'd like the linguini with the clam sauce, please.
how did you find me?
the GPS on your watch.
what are you doing here?
look, I'm-I'm sorry.
I came for backup only.
I told you, it was personal.
I know. I know, but I flashed.
look, I'm all...
I'm all for a little time off, and God knows, you deserve it, but I think that you should know that the much, much, much older gentleman that you're having dinner with right now is a very bad man, Sarah.
Chuck... -Let me finish.
the guy is a total loser, all right?
absolute bottom-feeding, scum of the earth, have I mentioned, considerably older man?
all true, but I'm a hell of a dancer.
Chuck, I'd like you to meet my dad, Jack Burton.
dad, this is my boyfriend, Chuck.
a real pleasure, sir.
french toast, whipped cream, fresh strawberries.
just how you like them.
when I was 12.
well, you need to eat something.
big day at work.
what is it you're doing again?
making milkshakes?
frozen yogurt.
sounds stimulating.
pays the bills.
well, yeah, I can see that.
very believable.
and what is that supposed to mean?
this place. Your job. Your name.
Sarah Walker? That schnook from last night.
you're working an angle.
I mean, he's probably the son of some, uh, rich Beverly Hills family?
look, Chuck is my boyfriend, and he makes $12 an hour so you stay away from him.
Hey, you don't want to cut me in, fine.
I don't need his money.
I got my own.
Oh, my God.
that looks like almost a million dollars.
well, Christmas came a little early.
for you.
no, thanks.
I'm not interested in your stolen money.
stolen? That's what you think of your old man, some two-bit thief?
darling, a thief has to run out of town as fast as he can, but a good con man...
a good con man can leave whenever he wants.
I remember, Dad.
so, who donated the money anyway?
a couple months ago, I flew over to Dubai.
you wouldn't believe the kind of money they got floating over there.
this particular donation is compliments of Sheik Rajiv Amad.
Amad? The Saudi oil family?
my daughter knows her Arabs.
I got to go to work.
forgetting something?
have fun at the office.
in the spirit of full disclosure, my father has conned Sheik Rajiv Amad out of nearly a million dollars.
hit the big time.
give the order, and I'll bring him in.
What?! You're gonna arrest your own father?
isn't that kind of a conflict of interest?
if Agent Walker's uncomfortable, I'd be happy to make the arrest.
no one is getting arrested.
yet.
Amad's been on the CIA's terror watch list for years.
he's suspected of funding terrorist regimes in Afghanistan and Kenya.
we have no recent photos, and he goes by a number of different aliases.
any information your father could provide about the sheik's financial holdings would be valuable intel.
general, my father is unaware of my CIA career.
in fact, I'm not sure he would be all that proud.
no one is asking you to compromise your cover, Agent Walker.
just talk to your father.
take the Intersect with you.
general, my father...
your father conned a very connected, very dangerous man.
you better find out how deep he's in before the sheik does.
captain Morgan.
Hey, buddy.
uh, have you seen Chuck?
left for work. What's up?
what's up?
basically, my life is over, that's what up.
you ready for this?
Anna asked me to get an apartment together.
big step, little man.
all right.
I don't know about all right.
I- I...
you know what, man? I just don't think I'm ready for that.
things are good with us.
you know, why-why rock the boat?
permission to speak freely?
there are no secrets between us.
would you agree that you have no credit, no life plan, no apartment, no car, no adult responsibilities of any kind?
on rare occasion, I do my own laundry.
time to grow up, Morgan.
I know. Here's the thing.
this apartment--it's a lot of dough.
it'll clear me out.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
you're a little short on cash, you know, we'll lend it to you.
don't worry about it. -Wait a minute.
you'd do that for me? Really?
Yeah.
that's-that's super cool, man.
Why?
because I believe in you.
consider it an investment in your future.
are you...Are you sure about that?
Yes, I'm sure.
besides, you'll pay me back.
12% interest every week, or it goes up two points.
Absolutely.
what does that mean? -$2, 500 should cover it.
there you go, Morgan.
welcome to adulthood.
we've been waiting for you.
Sarah was just bluffing with Beckman, right?
I mean, she'd never arrest her own father.
why not? Guy's a criminal.
been in and out of jail her whole life.
but he...but he seems to care, though.
you know, I mean, at least he's attempting to have a relationship.
I don't even know where my own father is.
Oh, that's sad.
you've confused me with someone that cares about your life before the Intersect.
good session, buddy.
really feel like we had a breakthrough there.
so long, Chuck.
we had a good run, didn't we?
stuff of legend.
where you headed?
adulthood.
Anna and I are moving in together.
Really? That's fantastic! Congratulations, buddy.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.
enjoy your youth, Charles.
enjoy every damn minute of it.
dude, have you seen her?
who? -Just the hottest piece ever to come into this store!
not even human.
smoking hot.
where?
follow your boys.
follow your boys.
1981 DeLorean DMC.
only 9, 000 made.
the exact car from back to the Future.
actually, the Back to the Future car had a Porsche engine.
when's it going to be done?
few weeks.
months, at least.
well, hopefully the iPod adapter will help me sell it.
are you serious?
how could you have any trouble selling this treasure?
the passenger door doesn't work, the gas mile age is horrible, and if it actually goes over 22 miles per hour, it stalls.
I'll take it.
deal.
good boy. -He's not a schnook!
he's a wonderful caring, intelligent guy.
who's a class A schnook.
look, you don't want to cut me in, no problem.
but don't play me for a fool.
the guy has 2, 200 bucks to his name.
how do you know?
I lifted his ATM card last night.
I wanted to check him out 'cause I was worried about you.
and now that you know he's broke?
now, I'm really worried.
I'm going to get a cab.
Charlie, there you are.
Hi.
good to see you again, Mr. Burton.
Oh, please, please, Jack.
nice tie.
looking sharp, young man.
well, I think he's warming up to me.
this accidentally fell into my father's pocket.
it's okay.
he's just being protective of you.
and after the way I behaved last night, I can't say that I blame him.
Chuck, you're attributing good intentions to him because you're a good person.
well, he must have done something right.
you turned out pretty good.
let's go.
the trick was it had to be an actual accident.
angel here was the best.
she could make a real doc believe that she had a broken arm.
uh, that's because I did.
one time--that's only because the armored truck hit a patch of ice.
unforeseeable act of God, honey.
at least your childhood was filled with excitement.
no kid had as much fun as you did.
um, so this latest, uh, score?
Sarah said you were just in Dubai?
sure it's okay?
Oh, he's fine. Trust me.
always, darling.
never forget that.
something about, uh, a rich sheik?
I'm not a boastful man, Charlie, but this was my Mona Lisa.
these oil guys were just dying to buy anything American.
Oh, no. You didn't.
of course I did.
I think I'm missing a step here.
he pulled a Lichtenstein.
a Lichten what?
Lichtenstein is a crazy invention of my father's.
a German billionaire who has fallen on hard times, and needs to sell something fast.
so, like, a piece of art, or jewelry?
bigger.
a boat? A plane?
closer, Charlie.
but I brought you to my hotel fora reason.
I sold them that.
what?
you sold them Nagamichi Plaza?
that's incredible.
that's dangerous.
they're going to find you.
Oh, relax.
the 700 grand is a finder's fee for putting them in touch with Lichtenstein.
by the time they know it's gone, I'll be on an island.
remember, Charlie, the bigger the lie, the easier...
the easier it is to believe.
very good. Very good.
you think your dad bought us as a couple?
he's a pretty sharp guy.
he has his moments.
maybe we should make up the PDA.
try and sell it a little better.
very funny.
just make sure you have your wallet.
I just flashed. That's him.
that's Sheik Rajiv Amad.
stay here. -What do you think he wants?
what do you think?
too bad he doesn't exist.
this, uh, this has all been a terrible misunderstanding.
why don't we meet in the morning in Mr. Lichtenstein's office and we can settle this whole mess.
you must think I'm a fool, Mr. Burton.
I want my money.
well, you want your money back, that's fine, but I have to warn you then the deal is off.
in fact, uh, this is Mr. Lichtenstein's personal secretary right here.
ms. Applebaum?
may I present Sheik Rajiv Amad.
it's a pleasure to meet you.
Mr. Lichtenstein has been expecting you.
how's tomorrow at 2: 00?
I have a better idea.
why don't we go get him right now?
I thought so.
there's no Lichtenstein.
Mr. Lichtenstein?
is there a Mr. Lichtenstein here?
ja.
uh, Mr. Lichtenstein, you have a message.
uh, Sheik Rajiv Amad, may I present Hans Lichtenstein.
unfortunately, Mr. Lichtenstein only speaks German.
but he'll be happy to meet you tomorrow at his office.
2: 00?
okay.
but if I don't get my building, he's a dead man.
translate that.
okay.
I knew you two were on the grift.
you can't put one past your old man.
Hey, honey, why is there$2, 500 missing from our account?
I forgot to tell you, I lent it to Morgan.
I can only assume that you met some other Morgan at work, because the thought of you giving away a hunk of our nest egg is just too horrific to consider.
I didn't give it away.
I lent it to him so he can get an apartment with Anna.
uh, Chuck, how much does Morgan make at the Buy More?
uh, about 12 bucks an hour.
not including his always appreciating comic book collection which I would value in the $500 area.
Devon... -It was an investment in his future.
you know, so he could become an adult.
that would probably be Morgan.
he's giving me a ride to work.
on what, his handlebars?
no, uh, uh, Morgan, Morgan bought a barely functioning '81 DeLorean that...
only goes 22 miles an hour, so I better get going.
see ya.
you don't have to say it, babe.
I'll get our money back.
general, I'd like to apologize for last night.
Chuck never should have gotten caught up in my father's ridiculous con.
I recommend we place the Intersect in protective lockdown till we're sure the sheik is out of the country.
and waste the perfect setup?
I'm not sure I follow.
the CIA has been trying to locate the hidden bank accounts of the Amad family for years.
if you can convince him to wire you the funds, we can access those accounts and freeze them.
uh, funds for what?
the building.
it will need to beat least $10 million to access his international accounts.
general, is the agency asking us to commit fraud?
no, that would mean the CIA has some knowledge of your mission.
how are we supposed to sell a 60-storybuilding in one day?
ask your father.
he seems to be very proficient in his chosen profession.
wait, this is the sound coming from here.
Oh, that's... -Yeah, you thought that the...
do you know where Morgan is?
who's to say?
if he was able to get a hold of some high-grade plutonium, he could be anywhere.
any place. Any time.
the Old West perhaps?
if I could travel in time, I'd go to Lester's birth.
I'd love to see the look on your face when you emerged from the vaginal canal.
morgan went to the DMV to get plates for the DeLorean.
I lent him that money to get an apartment, not blow it on some stupid car.
what?
that money was for our apartment?
I'm gonna kill him.
get in line, Anna.
all right, here's the thing.
I beg both of you to reserve judgment until you've seen the plate.
cause you are gonna be.
Yeah.
I nailed it, right?
you have exactly one day to get my money back to me or I pluck you from head to toe.
start with the groin.
he won't be using that region for a while.
but, honey...
I got it for us.
there is no reason to walk away now.
you know, I think we could get the sheik to pay a three percent deposit.
market value is over$300 million...
that's a lot of dough.
remember darling, pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.
well, the bigger the lie, the easier it is to believe.
we can do this.
I guess, uh, 5 mill each isn't too bad.
two point five.
you want my help, you have to use my team.
what team?
he's got a cop face.
no offense.
look, either he's in, or none of us are.
fine. But he's your problem.
all right, Sarah and I will handle the deal.
cop Face, you're security.
we can switch names if you'd like.
I can be Cop Face and you can be Schnook.
we'll use our account number for the wire transfer.
don't trust you.
no offense.
uh, question--what about me?
I mean, I'm familiar with Hogan's Heroes and Castle Wolfenstein, but beyond that my German is a little rusty.
schnook, your job is going to be toughest of all.
you need to sit there and not say a word.
all right, everybody gather around.
first, we need to evacuate the current building management.
can I have your attention please?
we need everyone out of this office immediately.
this floor is being fumigated.
we have already released toxic fumes.
that can lead to infertility and low sperm count.
all right, you heard them. Everyone out.
let's go, people.
quickly. Quickly.
next, we need to redecorate Lichtenstein Enterprises.
cop Face, you're going to use the gifts God gave you - your cop face.
they're here.
showtime.
most importantly, we need to convince him that we don't want to sell the building.
he's the one getting the deal, not us.
I'm sorry, Mr. Lichtenstein will be in Prague on Friday.
no, Monday he's in Moscow.
Wendy, I don't want to be interrupted.
I don't care if Mr. Trump calls.
tell him the building is no longer for sale.
I'll see him next week in New York.
gentlemen, welcome.
we'll have to call you back next week.
Bye-bye.
Mr. Lichtenstein will see you now.
gentlemen, may I present to you Mr. Hans Lichtenstein.
well, I'm sure you're very busy, so we'll make this as painless as possible
after your lawyers examine the contracts and the inspections are done, we can have a more formal meeting.
for now, we only require a three percent deposit to take the property off the market.
and that would be...
$10 million.
first, I would like to have a word with Mr. Lichtenstein.
of course.
I'll translate.
I'm sorry. I don't trust you.
I brought my own translator.
Hallo, HerrLichtenstein.
Irgendetwas, dasSie sagen m. gen, sagen Sie durch mich.
that is the worst German accent I have ever heard.
you...you butcher my language.
the deal is off.
sounds like Colonel Klink.
so, as far as you know, no one ordered an exterminator today?
I'm on my way now to find out what the hell is going on.
we got company. Time to wrap it up.
I'm sorry, Mr. Amad.
it looks like the deal is off, but if I could have your account number,
I'd be happy to wire you the $700, 000that you gave to Mr. Burton.
wait, wait, wait, wait.
now, there's no reason to panic.
everyone, calm down.
we can work this out.
nein, nein!
out of my building.
the deal is off.
Mr. Lichtenstein has been offended. Everyone out of the building.
there's no reason to panic.
uh, we're all businessmen here. Let's just sit down and finish...
enough!
you're all crazy.
no more games.
this is my building.
we had a deal.
uh, well, Sheik, would you care to, uh, type in your account number for security purposes?
uh, just go ahead and do the typey type.
feel free to look over the space.
we'll, uh, give you a moment.
never do business with Germans.
who the hell are you?
and how did you get up here?
why does that wall say Lichtenstein?
to Lichtenstein.
well, you pulled it off, kid.
you made me a believer.
well, my German is a little rusty, but...
no, no, that you two are a couple.
for later, Cop Face.
Oh, Victory Smoke. Thanks.
you did good, baby. -So did you.
I'm gonna get some ice.
well, I'm not one to say I told you so, but I think that worked out pretty good, now, didn't it?
I guess he pulled through for me...
this one time.
Yes, General?
mission accomplished.
the money was transferred to the CIA account about an hour ago.
Beckman never got the money.
the laptop is gone.
so is my cigar.
they were all out of fruit, so I was forced to bring up a couple chocolate croissants.
Oh, I guess I have no choice but to take those off you.
come in.
you okay?
I'm fine.
my dad will turn up somewhere, but, uh, I guess the real crime is that we didn't get to freeze the sheik's accounts.
well, I'm sorry if I pushed you into trusting your father.
if there's one thing I learned from my father, it's be ready for disappointment.
and if it's anyone's fault, it's mine.
no, it's not.
11 years ago, my father left Ellie and me.
he's a...
he was an unusual man.
I guess that's generous.
an engineer.
we used to get Christmas cards and birthday calls, and then one year it just...
it just stopped.
I don't know why.
what I do know is that it wasn't my fault.
granted, it took a significant amount of time and...
an incredible amount of therapy to come to that realization, but...
you need to know that your father's sins are his and not yours.
that's pretty eloquent for 9: 00 a. m.
what can I say?
I am an articulate schnook.
lucky for me.
you're alone?
Yes, General.
we've tracked down Jack Burton.
he checked into a downtown motel under the alias, Guido Merkins.
well, I understand the sensitivity of the situation.
I'll go alone.
agent Casey?
yeah?
tell Agent Walker I'm sorry.
Roger that.
where am I going to find $2, 500?
Hey, my man.
looking well as usual.
Oh, my, and that...
that scent.
it's like the beach after the rains.
what do you call it?
deodorant.
what do you want?
I, uh...I need to borrow some money or your future brother-in-l's gonna...
pluck me from head to toe.
how much we talking?
um, not too much.
$2, 500?
give or take.
you did good, babe.
no kid had as much fun as you did.
what?
baby, I'm sorry, but I got a perfect excuse for what happened.
well, I'd love to hear all about it.
some other time.
just remember, I did it all for you.
so touching.
Oh, so touching-- family reunion.
now, where the hell is my money?
I don't have it.
well, then, we have a real problem.
don't give it to him, honey.
if anything happens to my father...
what, you will con me out of more money?
no...
I'll kill you.
then, bring me what is mine, and we won't have a problem.
okay?
I'll call you in an hour.
thank you so much for this.
Oh, yeah.
do you mind?
Oh, I can't know your PIN?
I'll give you mine if it makes you feel better.
there are some boundaries, Morgan.
all right, all right, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God," what?
Oh, you're broke, right? It's okay.
don't feel bad, dude. You know what?
there are places I could use some grooming, so forget about it.
Hey, hey, Sarah.
look, I hope this isn't a mistake and the CIA has decided to compensate me for my numerous acts of heroism...
later, Chuck.
but there happens to be an extra-- oh,
I don't know--$10 million in my ATM account.
what?
why would my father put the sheik's money in your account?
again, we're not so sure that this is coming from your father.
I'm still clinging to the compensation theory.
leave it there.
you know, that's not a bad idea.
it should earn a couple thousand a day in interest.
what are you doing?
where are you going?
it's personal.
you've seen Walker?
Yeah, she just left in a real big hurry with two duffel bags stuffed full of T-shirts and some serious firepower.
where are you going?
it's personal.
Morgan. -Yeah, buddy.
Morgan, I'm gonna loan you the money.
Oh, thank you.
first, I need to borrow the De-Morgan. It's an emergency.
Oh, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yours, done.
what's up?
it's personal.
treat her well, my friend.
that's close enough.
you have something for me?
Where's my father?
nothing.
don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I have your money right here.
Hey, no!
grab her gun!
Mr. Lichtenstein, thank you for joining.
here to sell me the DeLorean?
I have your money, okay?
and I can wire it to you right now.
if you're lying, I will put a bullet in her head.
all I need is your account number.
please. We're just a couple of bad con men who got in way too deep.
all right? All we want to do is give you your money back.
come take it and let us go.
the sheik's account number.
decent plan, Bartowski.
of course I'll never tell him that.
there. You have your money.
pleasure doing business.
now kill them.
what?
hold it right there!
u. S. Treasury.
don't anybody move.
send 'em up, boys.
I got him.
