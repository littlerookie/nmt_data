you with me?
Yeah. -Then what are you doing?
I'm going to look for Adrian's itinerary.
maybe he keeps on file.
something's not right. -Agreed.
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess all work for Pyramid.
Moloch said the Comedian mentioned list with his and Slater's name on it.
whoever owns Pyramid could be giving these people cancer.
setting Manhattan up.
funny.
ancient pharaohs looked forward to the end of the world.
believed cadavers would rise, reclaim hearts from golden jars.
must currently be holding breath in anticipation.
Pharaohs?
got a psych profile on Manhattan.
see what the corporate head-peepers say.
subject continues to retreat emotionally.
if the only remaining ties were to be severed...
...we predict total detachment from the human condition.
I'm in.
no.
congratulations, Mr. Veidt. Dr. Manhattan's energy reactor is online.
your support and your enthusiasm is what has led to this triumph.
on behalf of the research team, we salute you.
Cheers. -Cheers.
what in life does not deserve celebrating?
this is the new Karnak.
this represents the culmination of a dream more than 2000 years old...
...a dream now assured because of your unquestioning assistance.
and for this...
...I am ashamed...
...ashamed that you must now share such inadequate a reward.
to the pharaohs...
...their greatest secrets entrusted to their servants...
...buried alive with them in sand-floored chambers.
sleep well, gentlemen.
our new, peaceful world will be indebted...
...to your great sacrifice.
Bubastis.
Rorschach's journal. Final entry.
Veidt's behind everything.
Why?
what's his endgame?
I cannot imagine a more dangerous opponent.
used to joke he was fast enough to catch a bullet.
he could kill us both alone in the snow.
that's where we're going now: Antarctica.
whether I'm alive or dead upon this reading...
...I hope the world survives long enough for this journal to reach you.
I live my life free of compromise...
...and step into the shadow without complaint or regret.
rorschach, November 1st.
can't you just tell me how this ends and save us the trouble?
it ends with you in tears.
tears? So you don't come back to Earth.
at some point, yes.
the streets are filled with death.
Jon, please.
you have to stop this. Everyone will die.
and the universe will not even notice.
in my opinion, the existence of life is a highly overrated phenomenon.
just look around you.
mars gets along perfectly well without so much as a microorganism.
here, it's a constantly changing topographical map...
...flowing and shifting around the pole in ripples 1 0, 000 years wide.
so tell me...
...how would all of this be greatly improved by an oil pipeline?
by a shopping mall?
so it's too much to ask for a miracle?
miracles, by their definition, are meaningless.
Oh, God, Jon!
only what can happen does happen. -Just stop your bullshit.
land this thing. Now.
as you wish.
you know what?
you can send me back to Earth to fry with Dan and my mom...
...and all the other worthless humans.
but know that you were wrong. You said this ended with me in tears...
...and look: nothing. Maybe you were wrong about everything.
you complain that I refuse to see life on life's terms...
...yet you continuously refuse to see things from my perspective.
you shut out what you're afraid of. -I'm not afraid.
you want me to see things your way? Go ahead, show me. Do that thing you do.
magic. Dreams. That is what I had before. I was a hero, goddamn it!
it's not my fault you got old. What do you have to complain about?
I put food on the table for you and your child.
call your friend Eddie. Maybe he can give you a better life.
even the grimy parts of it...
...keep on getting brighter.
you know, your mom, she was one of the all-time champion beauties.
you got her eyes, you know. You got-- -Take your hands off her.
Hey, doll. Long time no see.
not long enough in my book, Eddie. Get in the car.
now.
are there no depths you won't sink to?
Jesus Christ, Sally. Can't a guy talk to his, you know, old friend's daughter?
drive.
it was a mistake. One time.
guy tries to rape you, and years later, you let him finish the job?
what? Were you drunk or just lonely?
am I ever going to live this down?
Laurie.
no.
no, not him.
the Comedian...
...was your father.
no.
No! No! No!
my life is just...
...one big joke.
I don't think your life is a joke.
Yeah, well...
...I'm sorry if I don't trust your sense of humor.
will you smile...
...if I admit I was wrong?
about what?
miracles.
events with astronomical odds of occurring...
...Iike oxygen turning into gold.
I've longed to witness such an event, and yet I neglect millions upon millions of cells compete to create life
...for generation after generation...
...until finally, your mother Ioves a man.
...Edward Blake, the Comedian, a man she has every reason to hate...
...and out of that contradiction, against unfathomable odds...
...It's you
only...
...you.
that emerged.
to distill so specific a form...
...from all that chaos...
...is like turning air into gold.
a miracle.
and so...
...I was wrong.
now dry your eyes, and let's go home.
we got a bearing on that artificial structure. Heat signature's off the charts.
Veidt. -I don't like the way Archie's kicking.
the engines. -They're icing up. Hold onto something.
Daniel, you're coming in too low.
don't wish to interfere, but perhaps should pull up sharply
I know! I'm trying. I'm trying to pull him up, goddamn it!
I'm going to redirect the heat from the flamethrower to speed up deicing...
...but it's going to take a while and we don't have time to wait.
you need something warmer.
fine like this.
what is it, girl?
Mm.
Adrian's a pacifist.
he's a vegetarian, for chrissakes. He's never killed anyone in his life.
Hitler was vegetarian.
you're squeamish, leave him to me. We won't get second chance.
gentlemen.
welcome. -Adrian, we know everything.
then what's there to discuss, Dan?
plenty. You killed Comedian.
may he rest in peace.
Blake figured it out first.
Nixon had him keeping tabs on us, making sure we weren't rocking the boat.
Blake found out what I was doing here in Karnak...
...and by the time he visited poor Moloch, he was cracking badly.
even I couldn't predict he'd be the one to have a change of heart.
so...
...I had to kill him.
then I neutralized Jon. No easy task.
I put roughly $2 billion into tachyon research...
...to block Jon's vision of the future.
you used his psych profile to manipulate him.
got him to leave the planet.
I've known Jon long enough to see he isn't devoid of emotion.
his subtle facial twitches wouldn't be noticed by the layman, but to me...
...he might as well have been sobbing.
all I needed to do was tug on the thread.
the sudden flood of emotion Jon felt...
...when he came to believe he'd given cancer to the people he loved...
... was all the excuse he needed to leave Earth.
your bullshit assassin. You paid him to throw us off.
Mr. Chess gave his life in the service of a higher cause, Dan.
I put a cyanide capsule in his mouth...
...Ieaving only one loose end:
you, and your mask-killer theory...
...one you followed with the tenacity of a true sociopath.
I tipped off the police.
once you were in prison, I was able to move forward.
sorry to disappoint you.
we were supposed to make the world a better place.
Dan, that's exactly what I am doing.
nuclear war?
human extinction?
of course, my moral safeguards gave me pause at the necessary sacrifice.
a few key regions around the globe
new York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Hong Kong.
disintegrated in an instant.
fifteen million people killed...
...By Dr. Manhattan himself.
the world's punishment for flirting with World War lll.
jon wouldn't do that.
a fact no one outside this room ever has to know.
the energy breakthrough I was working on just came to fruition.
all these years, Jon was helping me replicate his power...
...unaware of how I planned to use it.
you see...
...the Comedian was right.
humanity's savage nature will inevitably lead to global annihilation.
so in order to save this planet...
...I had to trick it with the greatest practical joke in human history.
killing millions. -To save billions.
a necessary crime.
you know we can't let you do that.
"do that," Rorschach?
I'm not a comic-book villain.
do you think I'd explain my masterstroke to you...
...if there were even the slightest possibility you could affect the outcome?
I triggered it 35 minutes ago.
Jesus Christ, Henry.
why the hell didn't we get a launch detection?
it's not the Soviets, sir.
intel indicates the energy signature...
...was generated by Dr. Manhattan.
Jon.
interference.
cataclysmic interference.
I can't believe it happened.
this wasn't caused by nuclear warheads.
it was me.
I...
...did this.
what do you mean, you did this? -Not directly.
it was made to look like I did it.
Adrian.
speak of the devil.
Jon... -I know.
must stop him. Killed Blake, killed millions.
wait here.
Adrian, stop this.
the tachyons were clever...
...but even if I can't predict where you are, I can turn the walls to glass.
I should thank you.
I'd almost forgotten the excitement of not knowing...
...the delights of uncertainty.
forgive me, girl.
you're such an asshole.
Veidt, you bastard.
lf you've hurt her, I'll-- -Dan...
...grow up. My new world demands less obvious heroism.
your...
...schoolboy heroics are redundant. What have they achieved?
failing to prevent Earth's salvation...
...is your only triumph.
I'm disappointed in you, Adrian.
I'm very disappointed.
reassembling myself was the first trick I learned.
it didn't kill Osterman.
did you really think it would kill me?
I have walked across the surface of the sun.
I have witnessed events so tiny and so fast...
...they can hardly be said to have occurred at all...
...but you, Adrian, you're just a man.
the world's smartest man...
...poses no more threat to me than does its smartest termite.
what's that?
another ultimate weapon?
Yes.
you could say that.
came under attack.
millions of lives were suddenly ended...
...in an act of evil perpetrated by Dr. Manhattan himself.
since the attacks, I have been in constant contact with the premier of the U.S.S.R.
putting aside our past differences...
... we have both pledged to unite...
...against this common enemy.
with the rest of the world...
... we will prevail.
this is a day we shall never forget.
and yet we go forward to defend the human race...
...and all that is good and just in our world.
thank you. God bless us all.
do you see?
two superpowers retreating from war.
I've saved the earth from hell.
we both have.
this is as much your victory as it is mine.
now we can return...
...do what we were meant to.
we were meant to exact justice.
everyone's going to know what you've done. -Will they?
by exposing me, you would sacrifice the peace so many died for today.
peace based on a lie. -But peace...
...nonetheless. -He's right.
exposing Adrian would only doom the world to nuclear destruction again.
no. We can't do this.
on Mars...
...you taught me the value of life.
if we hope to preserve it here...
...we must remain silent.
keep your own secrets.
don't even think about it.
Rorschach.
wait.
never compromise.
not even in the face of armageddon.
that's always been the difference between us, Daniel.
I've made myself feel every death...
...see every innocent face I've murdered to save humanity.
you understand, don't you? -Without condoning...
...or condemning...
...I understand.
out of my way. People have to be told.
you know I can't let you do that.
suddenly you discover humanity?
convenient.
if you'd cared from the start, none of this would have happened.
I can change almost anything...
...but I can't change human nature.
of course you must protect Veidt's new utopia.
what's one more body amongst foundations?
well, what are you waiting for?
do it.
do it!
No!
I'm leaving this galaxy for one a little less complicated.
I thought you said you cared about life again.
I do.
I think maybe I'll create some.
goodbye, Laurie.
come on.
come on!
Dan...
...a world united and at peace.
there had to be sacrifice.
No! You haven't idealized mankind, you've deformed it.
you've mutilated it.
that's your legacy.
that's the real practical joke.
we repeat, there is nothing wrong with your television set.
you are about to participate in a great adventure.
you are about to experience the awe and mystery...
... which reaches from the inner mind to the outer limits.
sure you don't want a drink?
I'm okay.
Cheers.
there's something I need to get off my chest.
I know that Eddie Blake was my father.
Laurel.
what you must think of me.
I'm sorry I never told you.
I should have...
...but I don't know, I just felt ashamed. I felt stupid.
it doesn't matter.
people's lives take them strange places. They do strange things...
...and, well, sometimes they can't talk about them.
I know how that is...
...but I just want you to know...
...that you never did anything wrong by me.
you asked me why I wasn't mad at him.
because he gave me you.
Thanks, Mom.
I love you.
Hello, Miss Jupiter. -Oh, Sally, please.
excuse me. Gotta go freshen up. I'll be right back.
so how's it going up here? -Good. How's it going down there?
good. I think I've got everything working.
all of Archie's systems are upgraded. Finished the tinkering for now...
...so all we gotta do is take her out.
well, that sounds like a date.
are we gonna be all right?
long as people think Jon's still watching us, we'll be all right...
...in the end.
I know what Jon would say:
nothing ends.
nothing ever ends.
seymour, we got nothing to write about anymore.
everyone in the country...
...every country in the world are holding hands...
...and singing songs about peace and love.
it's like living in a goddamn global hippie commune.
well, Ronald Reagan says he's gonna be running for president in '88.
we could run a piece on that.
seymour, we don't dignify absurdities with coverage.
this is still America, damn it. Who wants a cowboy in the White House?
okay. I could look for something in the crank file.
crank file.
whatever. Take some initiative.
run whatever you like. I leave it entirely in your hands.
Rorschach's journal, October 1 2th, 1 985.
tonight, a comedian died in New York.
all prisoners...
all prisoners, report to level B, now.
the taking of a life...
is no minor matter. Nor do we do it lightly.
this man has killed, and he will be killed.
he will be taken down, his head will be shaved.
he will be given confession, if he wishes it.
and then, we will test the apparatus.
once, twice...
the third time, his soul will be in that new place.
and I leave it to you to conjecture where that new place will be.
I've no doubt but that your thoughts will be troubled.
keep them to yourselves. I want no demonstrations.
I want no comments.
take him down. - Move.
so long, guys. - So long, Bobby.
no talking.
What're you gonna do to him, take away his commissary, you son of a bitch?
keep it down, Jim. - Son of a bitch.
I can't believe it. Can you believe it, Neddy?
I can believe most anything. My problem is, I just don't care.
taking Bobby to bakery. - Sometimes it works that way.
that the guy's gonna die, and that's it?
what's your question?
that that's the end of it? That he goes in that room...
goes in that room, they light him up, and that's the end of it...
there's no eternal life for his soul, and the cruelty of the world?
is that the thing? Is that your problem this fine evening?
Yes.
why don't you talk to the chaplain? - I'm talking to you.
I'm busy. I've got my mind on higher things.
I feel bad, Ned. - Well, do your own time.
you two, put these on.
what is it?
just tell me what it is. - Shut up! Keep walking!
life's a hellhole, pally.
you two were talking?
answer me.
you two were talking during my speech.
I... - You swine.
you little swine. Hold him down.
you want order?
I'll give you order.
you want a lesson? Is that what you want?
you want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
is that what you want?
warden? They're ready, sir.
keep them here. We'll beat the other one later.
Yes, sir.
it's all right. It's all right, Jim. - I'm in bad shape, Ned.
for the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants...
when he seeth that their power is gone...
and there is none shut up, or left.
and he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted...
nobody move! Get back. Get down!
don't do this, my son.
open that door.
I'm gonna count to three. One...
go on, open it!
get in there.
here, put these on.
come on!
what do we do now?
tell them you got a man for the morgue.
man for the morgue! - Where's your pass?
come on!
I'm not sure this is such a good idea. - Nobody's asking you, Ned.
Bob, they catch us now, they'll kill us.
welcome aboard.
come on.
come on!
are we going, or are we dying?
come on.
come on!
all right, let's go.
look, Bob... - What?
get out!
ever hear the phrase "nothing to lose"?
get after them!
my God, you goddamn fools!
go!
wake up, Jimmy. Wake up.
rip it off. Rip the number off.
I'm cold.
I'm cold, too. Come on, walk it out.
I'm cold.
what happened to Bobby? You think they got him, Neddy?
look at this.
do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers...
for thereby some have entertained angels, unawares.
hebrews 13: 1. - Very touching.
Hebrews.
wait a second.
hello.
who the hell are you?
do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers...
for thereby some have entertained angels, unawares.
hebrews 13: 1.
what are you? Priests?
Yeah, that's right, we're priests.
you put her down, I'll give you a ride.
into the town, across the bridge, and we're free.
I'm sure they're looking for you.
what? - I'm sure they're looking for you.
who's looking for us? - The monastery, your fellow priests.
Yeah, I'm sure they're looking for us.
what, are you missing morning prayers?
Yeah, we're missing the whole program. What do you care?
I don't care a damn thing. I told you, it's all superstition, far as I'm concerned.
that's fine. Now you just drop us off at the town.
I'll tell you what else. You get people worked up.
you get people worked up over that shrine of yours, that Weeping Virgin.
we'll get out here.
won't be one more minute, I'll have you down.
no, we'll get out here.
well, I could use your help...
carry my deer to the butcher.
I'll tell you what, you go down to the garage...
and we'll come down and help you carry your deer for you.
why don't you just come with me?
we need a moment to compose our thoughts.
if it weren't for you, I'd never have killed that deer.
well, thank you for your courtesy. God bless you and all that.
can you swim, Jimmy? - No.
neither can I.
you think Bobby made it, Neddy? - Not like this, he didn't.
gotta ditch these togs.
come on.
what are you gonna do on free street, Neddy?
I'm gonna do it all, pally, and I'm gonna do it again.
and I'm gonna get two of the best of everything...
and anybody muck with me, they're going down!
come on.
ready?
I wonder what happened to Bobby. I wonder if he got across.
what happened, happened, Jim.
maybe they got him back. I'm not going back there.
that's right, we're not going back.
we look like a couple of Hoosiers. - That's right, let's go.
okay, let's go.
coins in the pocket. Coins in the pocket, that's good luck.
that's good luck, don't you think? - Right.
Oh, God. - It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
I can't go back there.
nobody's going back. It's gonna be just fine.
I gotta get some smokes, man, I'm telling you.
okay.
we'll get your smokes, and then we'll go across.
you take care of me, Ned, 'cause I got to get across.
keep walking. - I gotta get across.
just keep walking.
right with you.
just want a pack of tailor-mades.
Yeah, right with you.
bunch of damn nonsense.
all them damn priests in town at the shrine.
don't buy a damn thing...
but if they want something, you'd better have it on hand.
Thanks, Mrs. Harris. - Thank you.
be with you gents in a second. - We just want a pack of tailor-mades.
mementos of the shrine...
postcards, key chains of the Weeping Virgin.
not a penny in it, but they want it every year.
priests and tourists, put on that dumb show.
two packages of oatmeal. Set 'em down, will you?
account's getting a bit long.
well, I need it. Set 'em down.
I got a hungry kid. You'll catch me later.
what are you looking at?
Yeah, that's right.
special kind of smokes? - Luckys will do.
that shrine, talking about it, didn't mean to offend you.
kind of probably put my foot in it...
and you're tourists, come to see the shrine.
where are you folks from? - Here and there.
something I can interest you in that case?
we ought to be about going now.
we ought to be about going now!
you forgot your change. - That's okay.
sir, change. Let's see if we can't spend it in your store.
did you folks hear about the jailbreak?
no, can't say that we have.
where did you say you're from?
Yes, sir, it seems there were these three convicts...
shot their way out.
there you are. I told you I needed your help.
are these friends of yours, Caroline?
my help? - My car is stalled down at the garage.
I need you to haul that deer down to the butcher's.
you know these folks? - Know them? Yeah, they're priests.
this is Father...
I didn't catch your name.
priests? Oh, God.
Oh, God. I'm sorry, gentlemen... Father...
what I'm saying, rambling on...
I offended you. No hard feelings?
that's fine.
you gonna help me with that deer?
I mean, I'd die if I thought I'd offended you.
no big deal. - Or anybody associated with the shrine.
here, a little token. Take them, please.
take some back to your friends.
we've got the Weeping Virgin on one side...
thermometer on the other. Awful handy, really.
well, it's a cool day out. Button up.
no hard feelings, Father?
go with God.
I have that same coat.
Harry, here's a list.
also need a few shells for the old 12-gauge.
damn car is all stove in, fender busted, need a new radiator.
how am I gonna afford that?
I should sure enough go to your church, I swear to God.
why don't you?
everything's so expensive. Canned goods.
cheaper to shop in Canada. - Why don't you?
cause my car's wrecked.
if I walk over, how am I gonna get my groceries back?
after what you've done for us...
we'll go with you and fetch your things back.
very Christian of you.
you know what the Bible says.
what? What's that?
you know.
matter of fact, I usually do my shopping over there.
wouldn't let on to Harry.
you think that's dishonesty, you just go on and think it.
I can't do it. - You can, Jim, it's a piece of cake.
I can't do it.
you wanna kill yourself, that's fine...
but there's two of us here, and I'm counting on you.
so you buck up, Jimmy, and you act like a priest!
hail Mary, full of grace...
morning, Mrs. Blair. - How are you today?
you're working hard? - Well, we're looking...
for those convicts that escaped.
convicts...
Hey, I found 'em for you!
I found your two lost priests.
where have you been?
well, you know.
sheriff, you know who these are? - No.
Caroline has found our lost priests. This is Father Brown and Father Riley.
thank the Lord.
we thought maybe the convicts got you.
convicts. - Had a jailbreak.
got me some killers on the loose. That's all right, boy.
but where have you been? And where are your clothes?
they got lost when... You know.
found 'em coming through the woods.
looked like a couple of raggle-taggle gypsies.
gypsies? Do you know who these are?
this is Fathers Brown and Riley.
brown and Riley, A New Look At Revelation?
you're lucky. You say you were lost in the woods...
you're lucky one of my boys didn't get on to you, take you for the convicts.
what would they've done? - Done? Why, they would've shot you.
we've been meeting every bus for two days.
that's all right, boys, you let 'em through.
now you have a good day, now, Mrs. Blair.
we'd best be getting back now.
we gotta help Mrs. Blair with her groceries.
George!
run along over with Mrs. Blair and help her with her shopping!
we wired Arizona when you didn't arrive on time...
but they said they had no clue.
your monsignor is quite worried.
then the storm, and these prisoners...
I don't know. - I'll tell you something.
nothing was gonna keep us from coming here.
shall we go in?
get these chains knocked off at the blacksmith's...
then into these priest duds and back over the border.
you call it, Neddy.
coming? - Yeah.
I know this must be quite a moment for you...
having written so much about the shrine...
having never seen it.
that's why I took you back from the border.
I knew how much you wanted to be here.
thank you.
the Weeping Madonna.
I'm sure you'll find something here that'll fit.
God bless you both. - God bless you, Father.
God bless you.
father, we've been waiting for you eagerly.
we prayed for you.
we got delayed.
you know, you don't look a thing like your pictures.
fasting and prayer.
Yeah, it's such an honour to have men of your learning...
and of your reputation here.
we were so worried about you. - Yeah.
we wired the diocese in Arizona.
Yeah, he told us. We appreciate it.
well, thank the Lord you've come.
what's this?
you don't know what that is?
no.
it's a clothespin.
but, Father, why were you wearing it in your collar?
the thing of it is...
you know what it is?
no.
it's a reminder.
any of us could be snatched at any moment.
of course.
I'd like to add one special prayer of thanksgiving.
my brothers and guests here today...
a special prayer of thanksgiving for the safe arrival...
of Father Riley and Father Brown.
many of us are acquainted with their work...
and we are all, I'm sure...
glad of the opportunity to meet them in person.
we're thankful for their presence, their scholarship...
and their participation in the procession of the shrine.
today, a special blessing.
father Brown, would you render it for us?
I think you're Brown.
I think you're Brown. - You're Brown.
father Brown.
Bishop Nogalich points out it's his turn to say the grace.
please tell the Bishop we appreciate his courtesy...
in ceding his position to our new arrivals.
let him read. It's his turn.
I don't wanna get in anybody's face here.
no, Father Brown. Please. Honour us.
father...
if you could follow me to the lectern?
you know what?
let's just say something appropriate.
here's a good grace.
be nice to strangers, 'cause sometimes you're a stranger, too.
this is not a fitting grace.
what's wrong with it?
it's a bit unusual, but quite to the point, I thought.
what are we, Protestants?
as soon as we pop off the leg irons...
you listening?
Jimmy, get out of it, will you?
lay low here for a while, I'm gonna find some way...
to pop us out these chains and then we head across the river.
we're safe staying right here, Ned. - Yeah.
until the real priests show up, we're safe.
I hope you'll participate in our lectures later on in the shrine.
I'd like nothing better.
we get these leg chains off, then straight across the river.
you lay low around here. Half an hour, meet you right back here.
father Brown. - Who's Brown?
you are.
shall I enter your name in the lottery?
what's the prize?
don't bother.
no, I never won anything. - You can never tell. I'll put you down.
afternoon, Bill.
sheriff.
going to need them horses back this afternoon.
going back up in the hills again?
they got to be somewhere.
they got no food, prison clothes.
either they're up there in the woods or they're gonna cross down over here.
you got the bridge staked out pretty good, do you?
you best believe we do.
we're bringing out the dogs. The dogs will be here any minute.
we've got the prison staff, come down to stand guard on the bridge with us.
we'll catch them. Don't you worry.
bring them back whichever way they want.
you ask me, though...
I think it'd be a lot less problem, shoot to kill.
that's what the Bible says, isn't it?
they killed and they shall be killed.
yeah? - Yeah.
what was that? - Well, I don't know.
there she goes.
bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
it's been three weeks since my last confession.
I can't help myself.
please, Father.
what? - Help me.
okay, what is it? I can't help you if you don't tell me.
I've been sleeping with this woman.
all right, and you're not married to her?
no. - You're married to someone else?
my wife. - Your wife know about this?
no. - What are you worried about, then?
forget about it, stop whining. - But I broke my vow.
I'm such a sinner. Help me.
okay, look, try to break off seeing this broad.
say 10 Hail Marys, make a good act of contrition...
you see the girl again, pop back in, no big deal.
God bless you.
I can't, Father. I can't help myself. You have to help me.
now, look, I did what I could. You know, there's a time...
when a man's got to stand up, take a stand.
why don't you take a few days off...
no, I can't leave town till we catch those convicts.
I'm stuck here in town. I'm in a state of constant temptation.
please, I can't control myself. I need your help, Father.
you're a good man. You're a pious man. Help me.
how can I help you? - Come with me.
talk to her, talk to us together. - Look, buddy...
I've dragged her in sin, Father. - I'm sure you'll...
father, please, I'm begging you!
please, help me! - Get up.
please, Father, please. I need your help.
all right, okay.
okay. - Okay.
thank you, Father.
come on, get in there. Back, come on.
come on, take it out.
wait a minute. Take it out.
and I prayed.
I prayed to the Blessed Virgin, and I prayed to Saint Anne...
and I asked myself, "Why? Why am I so weak?
why am I branded?" And I say, "Lord...
I am a fornicator.
what am I doing to myself and to my wife?
I am a fornicator.
she can't hear, the poor child's deaf and dumb.
up here, Father.
I brought this priest here to avow our sins.
I don't care.
whore, we have sinned.
Hey, I don't care. And I told you I don't care.
you did what you did. If you think it's a sin, you live with it.
now, I'm busy now.
please, help me.
you got a problem? Stop coming here.
you think you're filthy? You think you're a swine?
all those names you say while we're doing it?
I'm gonna be sick.
you be sick, you be sick somewhere else.
well...
he's got no cause to be coming here like that.
you don't like the guy, what'd you go to bed with him for?
for $5.
what, do you have $5? I'll go to bed with you, too.
what, you think that's a sin? You think I care?
your mumbo-jumbo. You think I...
I slept with him, yeah, and I'll sleep with anybody that comes up with $5.
that's evil? Yeah, throw me out.
what you priests pay me to work here, do your own goddamn washing.
and don't you talk to me about God. Don't you tell me about sin.
your religion's so good, your God, get him to cure my little girl.
cure that girl out there. Your blessed shrine...
your Saint Anne...
your Weeping Virgin, yeah, cure my little girl.
get out of here. You've got your nerve.
I need a man.
I need a husband.
my little girl needs help.
I got nothing.
are you gonna give me those things?
are you gonna give me those things?
I wish I could.
I wish you could, too.
but you can't...
so why don't you just get the hell out of my life!
father, here.
what's this for? - It's for your beautiful project.
it's for the restoration of the shrine.
I can't thank you enough. God bless you.
it's for a good cause.
you don't know the half of it.
here, have a key chain. - Thank you.
actually, I got $5... - Get out of here!
I've had enough of your bullshit for one day.
come on.
son of a bitch. I knew it. Those convicts are here.
here, get the scent, quick, come on.
Yeah, who is it?
father? - Yeah, what is it?
I wanted to ask you...
a New Look At Revelation, you approached 10: 19...
love the stranger, for you yourselves "were strangers once in the land of Egypt.
and you used the word, a "sacrament.
you liked that?
Yes, I appreciated it.
and what I believed was an echo of the Gnostic.
the ecstatic mode.
that is say, a true...
well, that is to say...
a non-interpretive understanding of the text.
you got it.
I did?
I mean, I thought that I did. I just...
forgive me if I'm running on.
you know, here at the monastery...
we're enjoined to silence for most of the year.
yeah?
and, you know, it's such a pleasure when the bonds are lifted...
for the feast of the shrine.
and then, this week, to have all this company...
it's a heady thing.
well, and then we heard your bags were stolen, and...
well, in line with that verse, kindness to the stranger...
I wanted you to have these.
get out of here.
no. It's an honour.
it's an honour meeting you.
back at you. Hey, thanks.
well...
Oh, God.
here. We got to get out of here.
sheriffs are all over the place.
I really wanted to ask you, will you sign my book?
sure, give it to me.
we all especially enjoy your section about the shrine.
you liked that? - Yes, very much.
which one am I?
I think Father Brown and I, we have to talk.
father? Fathers?
will you be coming in the procession tomorrow?
depends on how things falls out. I can't give you a definite yes or no.
if you'll excuse us, we have to talk about writing things.
of course.
what took you so long? - I got lost.
look, that kid gave me his beads. - I'm very happy for you.
hold still.
thank you.
now, a dash across the river and it's free street, baby.
I'm with you, Neddy.
some booze and some broads and this country can kiss my ass!
we hit the border, you make the sign of the cross over the guy...
I make the sign of the cross... - Afternoon, Fathers.
afternoon.
open your book. Look in your book. Mumble something. Here we go.
open your book.
what do you think happened to Bobby? - I don't know. We'll talk about it later.
what's the first thing you're gonna do when you get free, Ned?
keep your mouth open, Jim...
and we'll talk about it on the northern side.
I'm gonna do something important. - Yeah, that's fine.
figure you're only alive so long...
you might as well do something with yourself.
piece of cake. Head in the book, read the book, mumble, over we go.
I just wanted to thank you. - You don't owe me anything.
it's so rare that someone cares, you know.
you didn't say I was weak. - You know, that's...
and I think I'm gonna tell my wife, just put it all at her feet.
that's a great idea. - Father, would you do me the honour...
of shaking my hand? - Sure.
thank you.
put Fathers Brown and Riley through.
thank you, Father.
George!
stand over here! Not there, here!
almost home free. We're almost home free.
head in the book.
good day, Fathers.
Oh, no. - What?
it's the warden.
no, don't run. It's okay. We're okay. It's okay.
one more minute, and over we go.
I can't go back to the joint, Ned.
you don't have to. Just read the book.
father, I'm looking forward to the procession.
friends of mine tell me you two are the authors of some pretty deep books.
you know, it depends on your taste.
I'd like to read them sometime, if I could.
I think of myself as a good Catholic.
we'll send you some. - I did a little writing myself once.
did you, now? That's great. - But I didn't have any luck selling it.
I was just wondering if you just might have look at this for me...
my goodness! Did we say our solemn prayer?
we're busy right now. - I understand.
gentlemen, it's all right. Let them through.
let them pass, please. Father.
sheriff, come here.
you instruct your men to shoot on sight or at my command.
$100 on the head of each man, dead.
you understand that? $100.
father?
you didn't answer my question.
is your shrine going to cure my little girl?
I mean, you told me to be true and I thought about it...
and I thought I would be true.
I'd be glad to be true. What's in it for me?
you understand? If I believe...
I can't talk to you now.
you could talk to me before, when all you had was shame and all.
why can't you talk now?
you're making a scene.
what's that compared to eternal life?
they've gotta be in this area...
or they would have frozen in the woods.
you got a lot of spunk. Why don't you get out of here? Beat it! Get out of here!
screw you, Your Holiness!
you think I didn't see...
the way you looked at me when I said I'd go to bed with you?
will you, for Christ's sake, will you shut up?
what are you, too scared or too cheap?
if God really made the world, he should have put some men in it.
you want to answer my question, Father?
I can't do it.
you want to lead us to the shrine?
you want to wash away our sins? I'm ready to change.
get this thing up!
damn you!
I'm already damned, Father. I'm damned to hell for adultery.
I'm damned for eternity.
what's a little rudeness going to get me? Two more weeks?
that's what I want to know. Everybody's saying how I...
go away. Get out of here.
you had no business to come to my room.
get out of here. - What, was that the act of a man?
Yeah. Who are you? You don't know what your life is.
you don't know what my life is. Who are you? Live your own life!
Hey, why don't you? Who the hell are you to talk to me?
why are you stuck up in a monastery? Watch my little girl.
we have a populace. - You do not have a populace.
when I am gone, you have a populace.
until then, all you've got is a bunch of suspects.
all right, how do we get past the warden?
she's deaf.
okay, we can do this.
just need a little thought. We need a plan. We're not gonna panic.
every house, clear it out!
send in the dogs! Smoke them out! - People live here.
I don't give a goddamn! People can live here when those men are dead.
now, just go easy. - Easy?
you've got the wrong man.
you got the convict clothing? - What? Yes.
we're going to go house to house.
take some men around there. Go around there.
do it.
you stay here on the side with me. - Get the dogs, come on.
follow me, over here. This way.
we've been in tougher spots than this before.
he's over there!
easy, boy!
who's in there?
good evening. - Hi there.
good luck on the lottery tomorrow.
you're not wearing any shoes.
brings us closer to the earth.
so this is the statue that cries? - I guess it is.
and what does it do? It grants wishes?
Yeah.
I know what I'd wish for right now.
I'd wish for two new pairs of shoes.
please, lady, give me and Ned two new pairs of shoes.
I say we try the river tonight, Ned.
what do we do? Walk on the water?
steal a boat?
they got the waterfront sewed up tighter than a football.
Hey, what are you... We're not going back.
I mean, Bob got across.
you don't know that Bobby got across.
we got to believe that, Ned. We got to.
we do? - Oh, yeah.
Why?
because if we don't, what are we going to believe?
where you going?
to prayers and dinner.
get back!
I'm telling you, nobody lives here except for the goddamn... monks.
lady, I know you think I'm a bad guy, but I know...
I know you been watching me. But I'm not a bad person.
please, don't let them take me back.
please don't let them take me back.
please...
the Weeping Madonna.
Hello, Father.
that's the wonderful thing about what you've written.
you and your friend.
we must never forget that it's simply a hole in the roof.
Yeah.
that's why we were so glad you could come.
you know, your notion on the true meaning of a miracle...
I just want to thank you.
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
no, I was just...
the word you're looking for is "praying," I believe.
it's not easy being a priest all the time. I understand.
don't worry.
it'll be all right, my son.
sometimes...
sometimes I...
I just need help.
there is no help.
did you ask her?
I suppose I did.
for what?
for help to get from one place to another place.
she's never let me down.
will you be marching in the procession tomorrow?
no, Father, in truth, I have other things to do.
I understand.
that is a long walk into Canada.
into Canada?
Yes, it's a long walk, all the way with the shrine, into Canada.
are we still doing that? - What?
we're carrying it, the thing, into Canada?
Yes, we're still doing it.
across the bridge to our sister church on the Canadian side.
thank you.
I changed my mind. I want to march in the procession.
it's too late. - What do you mean, too late?
you're late. You're a day late. - We got delayed.
we've just closed up the list.
well, open the list up. - Can't do it.
what do you mean, you can't do it?
can't do it.
you want me to go above your head?
he doesn't understand the meaning of the phrase.
he doesn't? It means, I'm going to go to the head man...
I'm gonna rat you out. I got a problem. I got a right to march in that procession.
you sign me up!
this is not a Christian attitude.
you know what? You tell him, "tough!
he says that there's something wrong about you.
yeah? You tell him he don't know the half of it...
unless he puts my name on that list.
all right.
who will your afflicted be?
I'm sorry?
he says, "Are you deaf?" Who will your afflicted be?
afflicted?
who will be the afflicted person you will be escorting in prayer...
for the intercession of the Virgin?
we just thought we'd be going ourselves.
Yes, that's lovely. Let's live our lives with no rules at all.
now, who will be the sick or crippled or disabled person...
whom you will be escorting across?
Hey!
Where's your mother?
Where's your mother?
Where's Mommy?
Mr. Holiness.
let me help you with this. - No. I don't need your help.
I want to ask you something.
you want to take me upstairs for a ride? You've got your nerve.
Yeah! I'm a sinner!
big of you to say so.
but I want to change. - Good luck.
I want to take your little girl on the procession of the shrine.
you go to hell! - Why, what's the matter?
you don't believe... - I told you, piss off!
I don't need your magic show.
if God wants to take your little girl...
I told you, I don't want your goddamn mumbo-jumbo.
and I won't let you curse my kid with it.
wait a second. Please.
isn't there anything which would change your mind?
what could I do to change your mind?
I'll tell you what would convince me. - What?
Jimmy. Jim... Father Brown?
Hey, Ned. - I have to talk to you.
is there anything else I should know? I mean, at all?
is this too scratchy? - Jimmy!
you get used to it.
I have to talk to you.
not now, Ned. - Jimmy.
I've got it whipped, okay? I made my mind up.
what?
I'm going to check into a deal here. - What deal?
father Brown was going to join our order.
what?
it's three squares and a cot. - Jimmy!
I told you, Ned, I'm not going back in.
I got the way out, Jimmy.
you do? - Yeah.
we're about 300 feet from freedom and I can get us across.
don't go native on me now.
what are you trying to do? Shanghai my pal?
changed our minds. Sorry, changed our mind.
I can't believe it, Ned. They're going to catch us.
no, I promise you.
all we need is $100 off that shrine out there.
when the procession starts...
I am going to be holding on to a part of the float.
okay, good.
then Father Levesque will say:
suffer the little children to come unto me.
here, take one of these.
then I will hold out my hands...
then you will come forward with the child...
bring the afflicted child forward... - Okay.
...so that the child can join the group...
of afflicted children.
I'm trying to explain these rules to you...
I'm listening.
...so that you will be able to follow them when the time comes.
okay, good.
then the child will stand in the group.
you will stand near the child... - Okay.
...and wait for the signal from Father Levesque.
okay, good. - Are you following this?
because we won't be able to discuss it at the time.
we can only discuss it now.
hail Mary.
now, first, we will all gather into the square.
and then there will be the brass band, and the children's choir...
will say the Ave Maria.
and then they will raise the crucifix.
the altar boys will gather.
father Levesque will raise his hand, and then you say what?
I say, "Follow...
I will pray for the inter...
the intercession. - "Intercession...
for the unfortunates. - Yes.
you got my money? The procession's starting in 15 minutes.
excuse me, aren't we going to finish discussing this?
Yeah, it's going be fine, will you?
Hey, you are one money-grubbing bitch! What's the matter with you?
whatever, but the kid don't march in the parade without I get $100.
you're going to get your goddamn money!
how'd you get this way?
none of your business. What are you to me? Nothing.
you want me to pray, you want me to screw...
you want me to march in the parade? Pay me.
nice talk in front of your kid.
she can't hear you. She's deaf!
they shot him!
they shot who?
the one they were looking for, the convict.
he was trying steal the money.
Jimmy!
they shot the convict!
he tried to get away, but they had to shoot him.
ah hell, Jimmy. Where?
he ran inside the general store.
they chased him inside the general store and he tried to get a gun.
move!
coming through.
warden, I was just about to...
send for the doc. Get some more men over here.
it's him. We've got our convict.
I think he needs a priest.
I'm a priest.
father, I've been shot.
I'm very happy for you.
he was trying to steal. I saw him over by the gun case...
come on, get him out of here. Get him locked up.
he's gonna die, let him die in jail.
it's a priest. Let him through.
Jimmy, I'm so sorry I told you we got to get out of here.
what are you talking about? I ain't gonna die.
get this goddamn priest out of here!
Bobby!
this man is on his last leg. Come on, hurry up.
get out of the way, move back.
come on, get that goddamn thing in here.
gently. - Come on, get him down there.
now, look, he give you any sass, you let him drown in his own blood.
Ned?
wait a minute! Get me that priest!
I want to talk to that priest!
father, this way now.
I want to confess my sins!
you son of a bitch, ain't there a Christian among you?
all right, Father. This way.
he don't look that sick.
excuse me. - I don't think he's religious.
get me that priest!
forgive this poor boy for what he did.
he knew not what he did. Deliver him from evil. Amen.
let him...
let his soul rest in some peace for all the terrible sins he did.
he was a bad person, but he repents for his sins.
bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
I thought you were dead.
it's been a long time since my last confession.
Yeah, but why'd you have to shoot that deputy, Bob?
cut the comedy, you would've done the same thing.
I'm not asking you where you got the priest togs, am I?
that's your business.
just tell me how we get out of here.
I'm sorry for you, Bob.
you're what?
you stand to gaff for the men you shot. I am so sorry.
and if there's anything I could do to make you more comfortable...
what, are you joking?
what can I do, Bob? You know...
you!
doc says you're going to live long enough for us to fry you.
escape from prison.
murder of two guards.
murderous assault on an officer.
now, Father, you finish up here.
I'm coming back in here in five minutes.
and then you're going to tell me where those other two men are.
that's right.
what can I do, Bob? What can I do to get you out of here?
I don't know, but you better do it, or I'm gonna turn you in.
they'll send us back inside. - Inside?
no, you won't be going back inside. I rat you out...
we're all gonna fry for those guards we shot.
excuse me?
you shot the guards, Bob.
no, I think not. I think you shot the guards.
no. You shot the guards, Bob.
no, I think you shot them!
I think that you shot the guards.
and I think that that's going to be my dying confession.
so what are you going to do to get me across that border?
father, are you about done? - Yeah.
I believe he's dying.
I'm going back. I have to get another priest...
to help me administer the last rites.
we'll be upstairs, Father.
here, put this on. I couldn't get the $100.
where the hell you been? - Bobby's in the slammer.
what? - Yeah.
he's in the jail. He shot a cop, and they shot him.
they got him here?
look, he saw me. He knows we're here.
he's gonna rat us out unless we help him escape.
we have to take him with us.
I don't get it. He says he's gonna rat us out?
let him rot in there! - I'm way ahead of you.
he says either he sees us coming back to save him...
or he blows the whistle before we can get across.
he's giving us five minutes. - How are we gonna get across?
I have no idea.
and now, as is traditional at this time before our procession...
we will have the drawing of our lottery.
and now, I call up to stand beside me...
father Brown.
father Brown?
there he is.
father Brown.
it's another Father Brown.
no, it's another Father Brown. It's not this one.
Ned...
father Brown.
I never won anything before.
I'm really anxious to get back down there...
so the procession will go on.
it is with great happiness that I present to you Father Brown...
whom, we may say, the hand of G|od himself...
has chosen to deliver this year's sermon...
on the miraculous properties of the shrine of the Weeping Virgin.
father Brown.
God...
have you ever felt completely alone?
alone in a world of danger, and no one to rely on?
danger on every hand.
in a world fraught with danger.
and at the brink of death...
I felt in my pocket...
and what did I find?
what did I find?
nothing.
there's nothing there.
it's all in your head.
they can take the money from you.
they can take the position from you.
I don't know, they can whip you.
people turn their back on you.
everything happens to everybody.
and you ain't gonna find nothing in your pocket that can stave it off!
nothing can stave it off!
pain.
affliction. We say, "power.
power doesn't do it.
cause you'll never have enough.
money?
I don't know. You know anybody who has enough? Still...
trouble befalls us.
everyone has that sadness in their heart.
some people are meant to be hard.
I don't know. It seems like they are.
we meet them.
is G|od good?
I don't know.
all I know is...
something might give you comfort.
and maybe you deserve it.
if it comforts you to believe in G|od...
you do it. That's your business.
people have guilty...
you know, guilty secrets.
but if that's yours...
that you want to go believe in something...
well, that's not so bad.
all right. I don't want your money.
just take the kid on the procession and pray for her.
and just you be careful and hold her hand.
what's this?
this is our ticket across the bridge.
we got to get out of here. We got 10 seconds.
don't move.
if there's any trouble, I'm coming out shooting.
if there's any trouble, it's too late.
trust me, you'll be the first to go.
what's he doing here?
how'd Bob get here?
I'll tell you later. Come on, let's get out of here.
they take the Madonna that belongs jointly to us...
and the sister parish across the river in Canada...
and the priests, they just walk it over there and...
he's gone!
tell those men to go down to the river.
come on, let's go!
warden, I'm so sorry.
for all those who labour and are heavily laden.
my God.
nobody move!
Hey! Come back here!
any trouble?
not the girl, Bob, not the girl.
shut up!
Molly!
no. - Molly.
get her!
No! Rosie.
damn, just let me go!
so long.
No!
Rosie!
help me! Please!
Fred, help them out.
that's okay. I'm gonna get back across.
back across with the shrine. Have to get...
father, thank you. You saved my little girl.
thank you so much. - Don't thank me, thank God.
she's talking. Oh, my God, she's talking.
my baby's talking.
he...
convict.
you've got to keep my secret. Please.
I cannot.
please. Do good works count for nothing?
come on, please, don't betray me.
he's a convict.
is this true? - Yes.
you're a convert?
Yes, we were both born... Lutheran.
God forgives you.
George!
quite a show yesterday.
true bread and circuses. - You liked that, huh?
it's a true misapplication of the teachings of Christ.
you know, we're all entitled to that now.
you keep smiling.
about time.
something funny.
I'd have been just as happy staying here.
isn't that funny?
Yeah, it's hysterical. Come on.
father Brown!
we missed you at Matins.
I kind of missed it, too. But what are you going to do?
are you coming to Lauds?
I think Lauds have their place...
but as it is, we got to get over to Canada.
you know how it is. - Father Brown.
I'd like to stick around and enjoy your hospitality and so forth.
father Brown!
we all enjoyed your sermon last night.
that's good. I'm glad you did.
are you leaving with the others?
Yes, I think we are. We have to.
father Brown.
we got to go. - Father Brown.
funny, right? I could have stayed in there.
Yeah, I told you it was funny. Now calm down, okay?
we get to the border, you make the sign of the cross over the guy...
I make the sign of the cross over the guy, over we go. Okay?
okay.
see you at vespers. - You bet your life.
I suppose I should thank you.
happy to serve.
Yeah, I suppose it's a miracle.
still asleep?
Yeah, doc says she should sleep till noon.
thank God.
what was she shouting at us yesterday?
speaking in tongues.
you worked a miracle. Is that the truth?
believe what you want to believe.
are you still trying to pick a fight with me? Still?
No! No, I'm not picking a fight.
no, matter of fact, I was moved.
I was thankful what happened. What, is that so strange?
no, not strange at all.
then, what about this?
I was moved and I'm thinking about I'll take holy orders.
holy orders? - Yeah.
you sure that's what you want to do?
well, can you think of a better idea, Father?
a better idea?
Yeah. Maybe I can.
a better idea?
you want to share it with me, Father?
all in good time.
so, I really think it's important that we remove all soft drinks from the vending machines and replace them with bottled water and naturally sweetened fruit juice.
are you talking about diet soda, too?
because i don't think we should take away the diet soda.
so many of our girls are watching their weight.
our oldest girls are 11.
they shouldn't be dieting.
I think she got a little "botie" between the eyes.
that's just naive.
well, she probably treated herself, poor thing.
if my husband dropped dead, I'd suck out, lift up, and inject anything that moved.
I know that you've got boys, so you are not understand.
understand what?
that our children shouldn't be guzzling sugar and chemicals?
no, we are in total agreement about the sugar.
all the "sugary" drinks should go.
so, everyone in favor of eliminating the "sugary drinks" from the vending machines... ladies.
ladies.
wonderful.
that's done.
thank you, Nancy Botwin, head of our healthy children's committee.
now let's take a break.
she's got the big bag.
guess he left her pretty well fixed, huh?
I heard there was nothing.
they spent all that money on the new have you seen it? It turned out gorgeous.
so, give yourselves a round of applause, everyone.
I wonder how she's getting by.
Nancy, we were all just saying how much we love your purse.
it's a knock-off, but you can't even skill. Entrachel's been wanting one of these.
how much you pay?
75 bucks.
Rachel take one look at that crooked stitching, and she know you a cheap trick.
the stitching on this bag is perfect.
Oh, yep. Right there.
God damn it.
looking in the dictionary the other day, i saw your picture, right next to dumb-ass white bitch.
Oh... corn bread.
Oh, that smells good.
I miss carbs.
my friend Talisa tried that no carbs.
she ate bacon and eggs for a whole month.
and I'm talking, like, five dozen eggs and a whole pig a day.
she lost 11 pounds. The shit works.
my sister does this thing where they leave a cooler bag full of no-carb food outside her house every day.
she's lost 17 pounds.
we should start that in this neighborhood.
call it the "I'm gettin' skinny 'cause some nigger stole my bag of food" diet.
Talisa is still fat.
Unh-unh, she looks good.
then why did Ronnie dump her ass?
cause he found out she was taking his money for little ron and spending it on shit for sherie.
and he all, "why don't my son got adidas?
it's stupid to buy expensive shoes for a 3-year-old.
he'll outgrow them in a day.
you calling black people stupid?
and lazy, and they also steal.
Oh, but we sings and dances real good.
white people steal... enron, worldcom.
they be stealing billions of dollars, flush it through some overseas bank account, then sit on a beach and count they money.
Oh, somebody been listenin' to the good reverend sharpton.
maybe black people need to start stealing a little big bigger.
maybe fuckin' so.
Hey, that bag looks a little small.
Oh, you did not just say that.
bitch, i can eyeball an ounce from outer space with my glasses cracked.
gimme.
Mmm.
Oh, acting like you know.
writing checks your ass can't cash.
you never question Helia's eyeballing.
that's the rain man of weed right there.
I apologize. I stand corrected.
you never question Helia's eyeballing.
that's the rain man of weed right there.
I apologize. I stand corrected.
stand? You on your knees corrected.
getting all beside herself, gonna come up in my house and tell me about my business?
I'm a bitch-ass bitch.
gimme a little respect.
I'm the biggest game in the private community of agrestic.
drugs sell themselves, biscuit.
you ain't shit.
you still ain't shit.
how much you got there?
Unh-unh. Take that crap off my money.
you're not giving me a present. You're paying me for weed.
excuse me for trying to bring a little beauty into an ugly world.
Oh, shit.
it's 2: 30.
well, where you rushing off to with your ass all on fire?
Dr. Phil isn't on till 4: 00.
Shane's got his grief counselor.
Oh, right.
I'm sorry.
I'll walk you out.
damn.
can you imagine, though?
a boy out jogging with his daddy, having a good time.
then boom! Daddy drops.
that would fuck a kid up.
you show me who ain't fucked up.
who wants some corn bread?
you all right?
I'm fine. I'm just late.
you sure?
Conrad, we do business, not personal.
you know I'm full service.
Andy didn't tell you that when he hooked us up?
Oh...
I believe my brother-in-law's exact words were, "dude, meet the finest with the finest shit."
I was just quoting.
I gotta go.
all right. Drive safe.
you know where i live at, right?
I do. Bye.
Shh. I think i hear something.
the brush is awful thick over there.
can you see anything?
he's quartering toward the spring coloring.
it's obstructed.
I can't get a good shot at the heart...
what happened in the guest room?
ask Shane.
I'm asking both of you.
I fell through the skylight.
but don't worry. I'm okay.
turn the show back on.
there's a huge hole in the ceiling Limpita told him to get down.
I him.
I didn't hear her.
come on. The deaf girl on Dewey Street could hear her.
she's not deaf. She just talks weird.
there's something wrong with her tongue.
what? Who told you that?
she's totally deaf.
and Dennis Kling says there's nothing wrong with her tongue.
Hey. Unh-unh.
what do you mean? What?
did they French kiss?
Hey, Mrs. Botwin.
Hey, Quinn. Do you want some chili?
Nah, I'm good.
that's right, Shane. They French kissed.
who French kissed?
Dennis Kling and Megan Beales.
Oh, they did a whole lot more...
Quinn.
Dennis Kling and Megan Beales.
Oh, they did a whole lot more...
Quinn.
I'm totally okay.
can i have the remote back now? Please?
you were here when he fell?
officially, I was at Kim's house, working on a science project.
officially.
Yeah, they were making out.
but nothing naked.
shut up.
where are you going?
it's a neighborhood watch thing.
I'll be right back.
want to fool around?
you know, one time I shot this black bear clean between the shoulder blades with my browning BLR-308.
next time we go bow hunting.
guns are for pussies.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
I told you! You can't miss the bear!
I love this show.
Boo! oh, god.
my husband died of a heart attack.
you want to orphan my kids?
so, what's up?
my guy went on this yoga retreat in redlands.
I was just wondering if you could help me out.
he didn't take care of you before he left?
well, they've been playing "winged migration" at the plex foe midnight show all week.
shit hasn't gone this fast since "the passion of the Christ.
people got stoned for "the passion of the Christ"?
that's disturbing.
it's not as disturbing as watching it not stoned.
religion, my ass. It's a straight-up snuff film.
why don't you take the week off?
that just goes so against my christian work ethic, Ms. B.
come on, help me out. I'd it for you.
I don't need you to.
my guy doesn't do yoga.
cash.
Josh.
come on.
I was at the orthodontist's the other week, and I heard all about Shane's there.
it's got to be costing you some serious green.
are you gonna play by the rules?
do to your own kind I'm putting the love in the glove okay, listen, you stay away from my customer base.
you don't deal to kids.
are we clear?
if they're too young to bleed, they're too young for weed.
no grass in the field, no grass will they yield.
you're a poet.
you know it.
it's getting late. You want a ride home?
no, I'll be good. It's the suburbs.
safe talk the streets at night and all that.
whoa.
don't kid yourself. Caffeine is a serious drug.
go away now, Josh.
later, Ms. B.
let's go, team! Hustle out there!
Unh! Foul!
ref, what's the matter with your whistle?!
well, technically, Nancy, the ref can't call a foul.
Shane was kicked by his own teammates.
Oh.
look at Isabel go.
how's she doing with her nutritionist?
Oh, fine. Fine.
she lost three pounds.
she has a very slow metabolism.
why she couldn't take after my side of the family, I will never know.
did you see my kick?!
Yeah, I want to see more running out there, Isabel.
that's what burns the fat.
your kick was great, Isabel.
Yes, it was.
Yeah. I'm just gonna go get a drink.
water or diet soda only!
you know, I love dean, but he has ruined my children.
he has.
Quinn has his asthma.
Isabel has inherited his unfortunate build.
it breaks my heart.
but we all have our crosses to bear.
all right, bring it on in.
hurricanes, nice effort out there, huh?
Oh, look. I think Shane is bleeding.
EW! Shane just licked his own blood!
EW!
maybe he needs more iron in his diet.
here you go.
okay. Let the healing begin.
can we go home now? Please?
it's not even half time.
I don't feel well. I think I have rickets.
no, you've got to tough it out, little man.
see, that's what your father would have said.
how about this?
how about you relax and have a drink and sit out this quarter, and you'll play again in the second halfway?
fine. Can I have fruit punch?
you can even have fruit punch.
I love you.
you know, from all the books i have read, you should really be encouraging Shane and Silas to talk about Judah's death.
or, down the road, you're looking at two very dysfunctional adults who will have trouble sustaining healthy relationships.
Celia...
what?
I had no idea you read books.
well...
Hey, Nancy... how's it going?
Douglas, do you know where your son josh is right now and what he's doing?
Yeah. Yeah.
he's over there somewhere.
Nancy, I was wondering if...
there's some really nice stuff in here, Doug.
okay, that's great.
it's kind of expensive, but I promise you, it's worth every penny.
Really?
well, you haven't let me down yet, Nance.
thank you.
you're welcome. Catch you later.
I'll see you later, Doug.
Oh, okay. Yeah, later.
he's trying to find something nice for Dana.
her birthday's coming up.
if he really wanted to do something nice, he'd ship that delinquent son of his off to military school.
will you look at that?
the little scumbag sells drugs right on the playground.
nobody does anything about it.
that's it. I'm gonna call the police.
Oh, please. Save your weekend minutes.
the kids drop whatever he's got by the time he sees them reaching through the sandbox.
there'll be nothing to arrest him for.
somebody's been watching "law & order.
reruns.
I've been finding Jerry Orbach oddly comforting.
Oh, you are such a brave widow.
all right, now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna chase that little fucker out of here.
Oh did, hear?
they found a 10-year-old with marijuana in his lunch box yesterday.
a 10-year-old?
put that on your ankle.
but I want to play! We're short one!
I guess I could go back in, coach.
what? Oh, uh, Botwin.
there's only a few minutes left in the half.
it really wouldn't make a difference.
you... sit there and ice that ankle so you can play after the break.
you hear me, cowboy?
now, the hurricanes don't fully blow unless you are out there.
coach, did you mean to say that to Devin?
because I think the hurricanes blow especially hard when I'm out there.
you watch yourself, Botwin.
all right! Way to go, hurricanes!
come on, let's see some hustle!
actually you should alternate cold and hot every 20 minutes.
don't even talk to me, weirdo.
fine. I was just trying to help.
I don't need your help, lipstick.
lipstick?
your fruit-punch lipstick. Fruit punch.
it's perfect. Fruit for the fruit.
or are you just pretending it's blood?
because we all know how much you love the taste of blood.
is that it, vampire?
okay, I'm confused.
am I "weirdo," "lipstick," "fruit punch," or "vampire"?
and stick to it.
how about "orphan boy"?
I'm going to kill you!
you little freak!
Shane, where...
come here, you! You are so dead!
Aah!
Oh, Devin. Honey.
you really need to watch where you're going.
well, it's never gonna happen in my house.
my mom's probably got, like, spy cameras in the light fixtures.
come on.
you think I'm kidding?
this is a woman who put one of those stuffed teddy-bear nanny cams in the pantry so she could see when Isabel was sneaking food.
I am so dead. I am so dead!
is he coming?
there's no one chasing you, Shane.
Oh, man.
where at, u wearing lipstick?
it's fruit punch.
I threw a can of soda at Devin Rinzler.
well, that was stupid.
he called me " orphan boy."
did you hit him?
no, just grazed him.
Oh, that's bad.
you can't miss the bear.
what bear?
missed the bear.
the shot was nowhere near his optimum kill zone.
what are you talking about?
don't you watch "bear hunt"?
somehow I've missed it.
it's only the best show in the history of television.
every week, these guys with gun racks go out and they kill a bear.
that's horrible.
no, it's so awesome!
you've just gotta bring enough gun to get the job done.
Oh, and tell her about C. G. S!
whoa, Shane, you're gonna wet yourself.
what's "C. G. S."?
Carter "grizzly" sutke. He's the host.
and at the end of each show, he's got...
he has the head of the bear that they shot that week.
and he leaves you with these, like, wise parting words like, "you can't miss the bear.
or he's gonna turn around and rip you open like a present from your mama on Christmas morning.
okay, we are breaking up.
come on.
think of the time this will save us on foreplay.
you just whisper, "shoot me in the optimum kill zone," and I'll be good to go.
I could whisper "linoleum" and you'd be good to go.
you're finally gonna do it?
thank god. He's been going crazy.
Shane, shut the fuck up.
Doug?
Nance, you weren't kidding. This stuff is primo.
you want to climb in?
and get your head out of your ass.
what?
you're on the goddamn city council.
what if someone like Celia walked by?
she is such a bitch.
great tits, but a raging bitch.
her husband's boning the tennis pro.
the Asian girl?
Mm- hmm. She loves him long time.
Doug, she's from Anaheim, not Bangkok.
she can't shoot tennis balls out of her twat.
when he was plowing her.
he said it felt unbelievable.
any guy who lets anything up there is at least part fag.
how do you know all this?
he's in the poker. And he just shared it with you?
he was losing, drank too much did Judah ever say anything about our sex life at these games?
no, no.
the guys who still have sex with their wives usually don't want to jinx it by saying something out loud.
he was a great guy, Nance. We miss him a lot.
Yeah, me too.
if only he'd lived long enough for me to stick foreign objects up his ass.
I never even got a finger up there.
you're an amazing lady.
and you're an idiot.
air out the van, and keep your smoke private.
you hear me?
Yeah. I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.
are we cool?
we're cool when you pay me.
now we're cool.
Hey, hey, hey. I was just getting into that.
you know, it's all about textures this fall.
give my love to Dana.
will do.
Hey, Dana wants you to call her about taking a class on vegetable gardening or vegetable cooking.
something with vegetables. Vegetable carvings, maybe.
excuse me, ma'am.
have you heard the good news about Jesus?
you made me a promise, you little shit.
take it easy.
I just heard a 10-year-old got busted.
a 10-year-old. You're a fucking liar.
the kid told me he was 37.
you promised me no kids.
but they all want it, and they cry if you say "no.
I just sold him shake.
he's 10.
when you open a shop here, I was totally cool with you, you know?
and you took away a lot of my parent business, but I let it go.
it's not okay to sell to little kids.
I'm selling to whoever's buying, okay?
no, you're not!
no, you're not.
no?
what are you gonna do? Are you gonna tell on me?
my dad's over there, getting baked in the minivan.
he'll just be pissed that i was holding out on him.
don't worry.
I'll never sell to Shane, okay?
you're a kid.
you're just a stupid, irresponsible kid.
and you're a hypocrite.
"keep kids off drugs, cries the pot-dealing mom.
Hey, if it gets you through the night, good for you, Nance.
I'll see you around.
can we go now? I hate soccer, and Devin Rinzler called me "orphan boy.
Devin Rinzler's a fuckwad. Get in the car.
are you two coming?
Yeah.
can we have sex in your house?
so, you guys really think you're ready?
Yeah. I've tortured him enough.
I mean, we've been going out for almost three months already.
a whole three months.
but I trust him.
and I think he loves me.
I think you're right about that, but you guys are only 15.
mom? Mom!!
I'm not sure where she is. Can i take a message?
now?
okay. Bye.
Shane! We're up on the roof!
who called?!
Quinn's mom. And she's on her way over.
great.
go warn your brother.
Silas!
she's gonna make you swear that Silas and I are never in a room alone without the door open and foot on the floor.
she is such an uptight prude.
no wonder my dad's screwing Helen Chin.
you know about that?
I had my suspicions.
you just confirmed them.
Oh, shit.
look, Mrs. Botwin, i think you're really cool, but Silas and I are ready.
you say that, but you don't know.
you never know.
when I had sex with my last boyfriend...
sex with your last boyfriend.
what, did you think we were virgins?
I'm climbing down.
see you in the house.
Oh, check it out.
Mr. Wells has a new boy toy.
he what?
I didn't know he had an old one.
Yeah, that guy Raoul from the security patrol, but they broke up a while ago.
hand me the binoculars.
Oh.
Oh, no way!
Josh? Josh Wilson, Josh?
Yeah.
I think he's a pot dealer or something.
I know nothing.
if it's girl scouts, get the mint cookies!
yes?
just one second.
the minty ones.
wait. Who are you?
I'll just be a second.
excuse me?
your dad may not care about the dealing.
but, from what i hear, this would really upset him.
okay. You win. No kids, ever.
I promise.
your promises aren't worth much.
I swear on my life, okay? You can't say anything.
you don't know what my dad is really like.
no, I don't.
you think you know a person.
he said he was 23.
you're not gonna say anything.
please, Ms. B?
I'll think about it.
what does that mean? What does that mean?
see you around, josh.
see you in church.
I know everything. I read her diary.
you read her diary?
they're going to have sex.
here. I brought you something.
it has a camera in it.
just slip it into Silas' room and flip the switch right under the tail here.
I think this would notice if a big pink bear suddenly showed up in his room.
and I'm not gonna spy on my kids, Celia.
I trust them.
please. They're all liars and sneaks.
and it is our job to discover what they're up to and stop it.
are you really that naive?
I'm beginning to think I am extremely naive.
take the bear.
I'm not gonna take the bear.
take the bear. No.
okay, fine. Fine.
just promise me, mother to mother, that my daughter and your son will not have sex under this roof.
I know that it's hard for you to understand because you have boys, but I don't want Quinn turning into some little slut, like that deaf girl down on Dewey Street who gave fellatio to Dennis Kling.
promise me.
fine, fine. Not under my roof.
you have my word... as a mother.
thank you.
pizza's here!
Where's my change?
here.
Oh, look, Silas.
look at that cute stuffed bear on the table.
we used to have one just like it in our pantry.
what happened to that bear? I miss that bear.
you can't miss the bear.
uh, that is the bear from the pantry.
I was just showing it to Nance.
Why?
Why?
I've been thinking of investing in one of those "make your own bear" franchises.
Oh, right. Well, are you gonna keep him?
because I'd love to put him in my room.
gimme the bear.
give me the bear.
he's all yours.
of course he's not here today.
he knows he'd get his ass kicked.
Oh, shit!
quit it! Aah! Aah!
Aah! Quit it!
quit it!
you know, I think pink's really your color, you fuckwad!
who's fruit punch now?
suspended.
the two of you ditch school to fuck in my guest room.
I've got everything under control.
don't you see?
technically, we're not under your roof.
see?
Oh, shit. Come on. Come in.
it's all right. It's all right.
Helia, break out that pie you made last night.
the white lady having a time of it here.
make her get her skinny ass in here and get her own damn pie.
slave days is over.
Oh, dean!
God damn it! Come on!
Oh, god!
Oh, dean!
put it in, helen! Put it in!
Oh, my god! Oh, oh, oh!
that little cunt.
I should have had an abortion.
I'm craig x, and you are at the bodhi-sativacaregivers club.
Nancy, it's sanjay. The bakery is on fire.
Oh, my god.
I am runningfor city council.
this is my thing!
you cannot become a lesbian just bse you don't want tolose weight.
my wife's been leading upto this -- to here, to the rabbinate.
I'm writing aboutwhat being a jew means to me.
come here.
did I mention I slept witha dea agent last night?
I'm out.
he doesn't know.
you done steppedin some shit, and you ain't gonna track itthrough my house.
Hello?
Peter?
I was wondering when I was gonna hear from you.
you really know how to keep a guy on the edge of his seat.
I can't do this.
I really like you, but, um...
I can't see you anymore. I'm sorry.
I'm a widow, and I'm just starting to get back on my feet, and I can't get involved with someone who does what you do.
Nancy, nothing's gonna happen to me.
you don't know that.
you deal with
with... with drug dealers.
I-I can't get close to you and lose you.
I just -- I couldn'T...
go through that again. I need to end this now.
I've been hurt, too, but I'm willing to...
take the risk with you.
I have very strong feelings for you, and what I do is mostly a desk job, nancy.
you carry a gun. I can'T.
please don't call me anymore.
I'm sorry.
what's this?
it's for the campaign.
family picture -- warm, fuzzy.
I put it on the calendar -- "wednesday, early evening.
you, me, isabel.
what about quinn? Isn't she a member of this family?
I'm telling people she's dead, get the sympathy vote.
Celia! - I'm just kidding. Gosh.
Where's your sense of humor?
I phoned quinn, offered to fly her back for the photo.
we both agreed, it would be too hypocritical, even for me.
she sends her love to you.
wants to know if you'll mail her some aa batteries and s'mores-flavored pop-tarts.
that fucking rat dog is giving me a migraine.
well, you can count me out, too.
Why? You're my husband.
and you're local. I don't see a problem.
maybe I don't feel like being a hypocrite.
hopefully by wednesday you'll be back to your old self.
you don't want me to work on your campaign.
why do you want me in your picture?
cause your tie is gonna match my dress.
forget it. If I'm out of the picture, I'm out of the picture.
fine.
fine. It'll just be me and isabel.
you take a lousy picture anyway.
have a nice day.
Oh, you too.
I don't know why we couldn't go to tacos guacos.
I was up for tacos guacos.
it's too spicy, and it never looks clean in there.
you're a pussy.
there are mexican things on this menu. Look.
look. They have tortilla soup.
it's a bowl of bullshit with chip scraps. I hate chains.
what about in-n-out?
in-n-out is independently owned by religious nuts that put biblical citations on the bottom of the cups.
they don't franchise, and they use fresh ingredients.
they cook with jesus.
I bet if we went into the kitchen here, we'd find some guy named jesus.
you trying to be funny?
I am simply pointing out that most southern california restaurants employ kitchen help of latin descent.
and that a lot of you name your kids jesus. It's a thing with you people.
sorry we're late.
it's andy's fault. - Totally my fault.
Where's conrad?
Hey, I've been meaning to ask

Yes.
Yes, you are. But maybe not with this.
I mean, you sold like six in Denmark, and four of them were returned.
one family who did not read the instructions.

well, we still have your pensions, remember.
hard to forget. My boss is peeved.
been chewing rear ends all morning, including mine.
that's why I'm here, back on spreadsheet duty.
spreadsheet duty?
indeed... got to go through your files, analyze your handling of our pensions.
geez. You guys really crank the heat in here.
Y- you don't trust us with your money?
fool me once, shame on me, right?
we need to be properly funded, and we need to be independent from the rest of your shammery.
okay. I see.

I'm sure we can make something work.

you just got to take it all with a grain of salt.
was he lying about his dads?

I haven't had the chance to plan a lot of parties lately.
no, they're weed dealers.
bunch of graduate students up at Columbia. Intellectual fucks.
never been a major priority for us, frankly.
good for them?
I caught Shane going through their files, and when I confronted him with it, he got defensive and stopped answering my questions.
any idea why he would do that?
no, are you asking as a... a detective or a child psychologist or a wannabe parent trying to butt into other people's business?
ms. Botwin, I got a boy of my own and enough God-awful, foul-smelling shit on my plate.
I don't need to play concerned parent with Shane.
fine.
sorry.
that being said, I would like to know that someone is concerned.
I promise you, I am. Shane is not involved.
but if there's anything else that you think or...
that you know, I'm... I'm happy to listen.
God, I wish my ex-wife talked like that.
but she'd rather shoot me than fuck me.
I think it's time you spoke with Shane.
that's a hell of an idea.
Yeah. - Love it.
you warned me about the publicity, and I barreled ahead, gold and glitter in my eyes.
heedless, reckless.
stupid.
but you understand what I was aiming for, right?
the Copenhagen wheels?
but it was also my desire for a better Andy...
a driven, forward-moving Andy.
in retrospect, it's... it's textbook.
me searching for a career in self-propulsion technology.
sure. - But at the end of the day...
I fucked it all up.
here she comes.
stay in the van. I'll be right back.
Emma, hi, you heading to your 1: 00 lecture, or are you heading to fuck someone over?
what? - First you fucked me... thanks...
then you fucked my business, and then, randomly, my uncle's bike shop. Bravo.
Oh, come on, you have to admit, the bike-shop thing was pretty funny.
is this some kind of big game to you?
no. It's business.
but we're Pouncy House, so we have to have a little fun on top.
you're good at having fun on top, aren't you?
come on, now. We rolled a few times, as I recall.
Hey.
Hey!
this isn't over. - Silas, you guys lost. Game over.
I want my Copenhagen wheels.
give me my wheels and an apology.
and fix my bike shop. No, give me a new bike shop.
Seriously?
do you not see the nail gun?
Yeah, that's kind of my point.
get in the van. Get in the van, or I shoot a nail in your face.
Andy, what are you... This is crazy.
no, no, no, no. I think not.
crazy would be sitting by, letting her shit all over everything, and not shooting a nail in her face.
that's crazy.
get in the van. - Can we calm down?
we'll just talk about this.
you've been talking all morning. You suck at it.
no more talking. Climbing. Van. Staying.
come on, come on, come on, come on.
this one.
there you go.
it's not like you're gonna do anything, anyway, not in broad daylight.
Hey, uh, I'm murdering somebody. Killing 'em. It's bad. Bloody.
does anybody care? No?
living your myopic lives? Okay, cool.
see? Nobody's pressing pause on their iPod for you.
do not get in the van. Hey! This is not you.
come on.
you're... you're no-violence Andy, remember?
I remember nothing. Put your seat belt on.
Andy... - Don't "Andy" me.
can I at least get in the van with you?
it's not a van. It's a giant turd.
I'm captaining a giant turd when I could be cruising down a bike lane, letting the Copenhagen magic zip-a-dee-doo-dah my happy little ass around this gray island.
but party pants ruined it for everyone, who still isn't wearing her seat belt.
grab the buckle. Put it in the clip.
buckle...
well, consider that your warning.
Hey! Andy!
you called my mom?
grow some hair on your balls, Botwin.
I'll be in my office... with the door open.
I know what you're gonna say.
I bet you do.
but it's not so bad.
actually, it is.
and at the risk of being predictable, Shane, what the fuck?!
you're in jail.
okay, so it's not ideal.
I just did three years... three years!...
so you wouldn't have to, and here you are.
I know. I'm sorry. But I can handle this.
you and Silas... you're exactly alike!
I said I'm sorry. Geez.
what did you tell the cops?
nothing that'll hurt us.
I can't believe this.
you get reception in here? Impressive.
did you ever get bored in prison?
come on.
I feel like that'd be the toughest thing.
figure out how to pass the time. What did you do?
I'll tell you later. Come on.
did you fight?
only in self-defense.
come on. Shane.
I just want you in college, you know?
just, like, chasing girls, cramming for finals.
why don't you save that dream for Stevie?
no, that's not a dream. That's reality. That's gonna happen. Come on.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch.
he said you could just go home and then think about it...
with a lot of swearing and talk about his ex-wife.
Yeah, Gina's a bitch.
sucks
everyone's
so, Klein didn't just disappear.
he disappeared with a lot of cash.
like, petty-cash cash or cash-cash cash?
by the way, about Klein's disappearance.
you don't know what we're talking about.
klein didn't just disappear.
he disappeared with a lot of cash.
petty-cash cash or cash-cash cash?
hypersensitive hearing.
enlarged stirrup in my inner ear.
we expect you to cover for Klein.
find excuses for his absence. Do what you got to do.
but do not let the public and the market catch on.
and replace that cash, obviously.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We got this.
you can return to your highlighting and handicrafts out there.
Doug, he was -- Shh!
klein was the cash guy.
I don't have the same connections, the same skill to get the money in.
I have come too far, whit. I've worked too hard.
I made too good a speech to let this die right now.
okay, we need the money. I will get it.
you hear me? I'll get it!
I was very clear. I spelled it out. I chose my words carefully.
how do you not follow?
you called me a zit.
there's a zit, and then there's the dirt and the oil and all the grime behind it.
you're the zit!
great. Got it.
so, I'm about 4 feet and a power tool from doing anything here.
well, you're a self-painted corner. Figure it out.
see, you're the manifestation, not the root cause.
I'm sitting here, asking myself, what's the root cause?
Where's all the oil and the grime coming from in your life, Andy?
you got a positive world outlook.
why does the world not smile happy smiles in return?
life's unfair?
Yeah, life's un-- No! Fuck! No.
you're ruining my train of thought.
um, pay attention.
Yes, there's the good, there's the bad.
and when the bad comes and gets into your house, your bike shop, and turns wonderful wonderful into shit shit, is it your responsibility to clean it up?
no, it is not!
make the responsible parties clean that shit up!
ha! That's it! That's what I'm saying.
you fucked this up. You fix it.
Silas let you fuck up his business. He can fix it.
Nancy and her shit -- let her fix it.
or fuck it up more. Whatever. I don't care.
everybody go fuck themselves and fix their own problems.
that's the message in all this.
boom! Yes! Eat my ass, everybody!
eat my ass, Silas!
wait, how'd you get in here? I locked the door.
you think I didn't have a key made?
fine. My mistake. I'll, uh -- I'll take care of it. See?
can you put down the nail gun?
Yeah, I'd love to, once she fixes her mistake.
silas, a little help? Please.
fuck it. Shoot her in the face.
that would be satisfying.
I suppose you have a key, too.
of course.
Nance? Nance, I need you to fix your problem
problems -- whatever they may be.
I'm not responsible, 'kay?
okay. I-I thought you were gonna handle this.
I am.
Yeah, it looks like Andy is, and
no, no! Unh-unh! Handling my problem, not
you, yours, separate, okay?
wait your turn.
okay. Okay, I'm taking this away now.
I'm taking this.
all right?
I could have been killed. - I know. Take this.
just like that, just when I was figuring it out.
God damn it, world! - All right.
come on. It's time to leave, Andy.
what? No. But she st-- she started it.
I know. Go home. Get some rest, okay? Fine.
what?
wait, where's my key?
Emma, so nice to finally meet you.
I must say, I was mildly impressed.
your little game of telephone --very clever.
and this -- cute.
a bit indirect, but maybe you're still searching for your signature style.
well, we were gonna go with skinny jeans and scarves, but you guys beat us to it.
and your attitude...
brash.
the thing is, you've got to make sure you can back it up with something.
I can.
you think so?
you're a lawyer-in-training, right?
so you're good at arguing, manipulating people.
but you're probably 10 years out of braces, and I'm pretty sure you haven't tried to raise three sons.
I don't see what that has anything
you have no clue what you're getting into.
are you gonna shoot me or lecture me, mom?
there are whores, and there are cheap whores.
I'll be back.
guess it's my turn.
Shane's not involved.
well, he's asking me about cover businesses.
he's reading about Pouncy House. You do the math, Ms. Botwin.
Shane's not involved.
it's, uh -- it's my older son, Silas.
Shane told me he took the folder to protect his older brother.
what's his connection with them?
he's just sleeping with some girl --um, Emma.
she's one of them.
and beyond that, I don't know.
she's not just one of them. She's the boss.
I thought moving to the city would be a good idea.
you know, I thought he was old enough to make his own decisions.
older don't mean smarter.
I'm learning that. God. How old is your son?
credit to you guys.
you might be the most fucked-up family I've ever come across.
you're such a piece of shit.
come on. I didn't intend to sleep with you.
I just got carried away.
you only intended to ruin my business.
and what were you doing when you decided to push Denny out of our Wall Street turf?
you think we're just a pushover little outfit, right?
Oh, mom and son -- that's so cute.
you have no idea.
14 years later, all of a sudden, it's "stepson" again.
ugly fucking clausey modifier word.
is he dating yet? - I don't know.
every time I ask him, he changes the subject.
well, God forbid you should know he likes girls.
I seen a cute little blonde coming to and from the house a couple of times.
Aww. Are you staking him out?
so, you got to get Silas away from these people.
well, he's not 17. I can't forbid him.
I'm warning you.
it starts with low-level pot dealing, and then it builds, fast.
it's not gonna end well if you keep fucking with us.
we'll take our chances.
do you guys have a body count?
the Botwins do.
even if we weren't here, soon your business would implode spectacularly.
models on bikes? Really?
okay.
but we have the most important thing.
you think I'm not doing everything I can to steer him away?
Shane just blindly just follows his older brother.
I'm doing everything I can, but it's tough as a single parent without help.
you asking for help?
from you? I wouldn't want anyone to get arrested.
not my kids.
but...if we made some arrests at Pouncy House...
you have the better pot.
but you have the better technology and distribution system.
well, you have the evidence against them.
I'm just -- I mean, I'm just saying. - We do.
we only lack the motivation to push the file to the top of the stack.
Well...isn't Shane motivation enough?
no. No, no, no.
we're supplying the supply. We get a bigger cut.
subtract cost from our percentage, but we still get an extra two points for system overhead.
system overhead"?
we should probably have more than one land line and one excel file.
Hey, the brain was solid.
I want that computer back.
fine.
fine.
fine.
one bust... Quick and dirty.
we get everybody we can.
where are you gonna do it?
uh, probably their store.
and make sure your boy's not there.
I don't know how to thank you.
just let Shane ride this out with me.
call off the cavalry. I've solved our problem.
Hi, it's Nancy. Leave me a message.
thought you might want to know...
I solved our problem.
call me.
you want to sleep with Mommy tonight?
Mm-hm. - In my bed?
Mm-hm.
you promise not to kick me?
I promise. - Yeah, okay.
shall I sing to you? - Yeah.
yeah? - Mm-hm.
what song?
one of your songs.
Oh, well, sugar, those aren't really meant to put people to sleep.
what did you sing me when I was little?
um, like, you know, Rock-a-bye Baby.
that's for babies.
so?
# When the wind blows The cradle will rock #
# When the bough breaks The cradle will fall #
# Down will come baby Cradle and all #
are you sleepy? - A little.
why don't you just close your eyes and try, okay?
okay. - Okay.
close your eyes. Close your eyes.
I'll help you fall asleep.
# Rock-a-bye baby #
# On the tree top #
# When the wind blows #
# The cradle will rock #
# When the bough breaks #
# The cradle will fall #
# And down will come baby #
# Cradle and all #
pizza man.
Hi.
Hi. Can you sign this, please?
sure. - Wait for me.
pizza man's here.
you haven't had a creative thought in your life.
what have you done in the last five years?
how jealous you are. - I'm jealous?
there's your tip. - Thanks.
you're welcome. - Good night.
I've... I've done my mid-life crisis.
you should get on with yours. - What?
don't talk to me that way.
you want to play Tic-tac-toe?
sure.
why don't we eat outside?
okay?
walk away like you always do.
Hey, can I have some pizza?
sure. - Mm-hm.
Mm. Nice.
tic-tac-toe. Look, I won.
come on, Maisie, you didn't let me play.
look at me.
you're cheating.
Maisie, do you ever wonder what Margo thinks of us behind that hauntingly calm exterior.
okay. Enjoy.
do you want to be "Xes" or "Os"?
um, I want to be "Os."
the ants go marching one by one.
hurrah, hurrah.
the ants go marching one by one.
the little one stops to suck his thumb.
you're a liar and a thief.
this is a colossal waste of time. - Fine, go.
Hey. - Hi.
Susanna.
is that Daddy?
shh, go back to sleep.
open the door.
open the damn door. - Damn.
stop making that fucking noise.
they hate me in this building.
Oh, there you are.
at last.
open the door.
Susanna. - Go away.
open the door.
no.
open the fucking door.
not this time. I told you it would happen if you left.
what? Are you serious?
Yes, I'm serious. It's my apartment.
open the goddamn door. - No.
you're a fucking headcase. - Fuck you!
now, remember your soil should be damp, not soaked.
you father's here.
maybe your dog died.
I don't have a dog.
you're never going to lose money on art unless you overpay.
this is a good price.
I need to know if you want the paintings,
I need to know ASAP. Let me just get rid of this call.
one second.
here is this month's schedule.
we would prefer if you'd wait the few extra minutes until the end of the school day so that we don't have to interrupt class.
okay. Okay, I'll make sure that absolutely doesn't happen again.
listen, why don't you and me go and get ourselves a nice double espresso?
with Mommy?
no, no, just you and me this time. Eh? Fun, huh?
Hey, so they're exemplary pieces...
are you kidding me? What were you going to do? Take her to Argentina?
I'll call you back. - People, just do I need to get some help?
no. This is not a game, Beale. Come on, baby.
daddy's not going to pick you up anymore.
I'm just going to pick you up, okay? Are you okay?
it's okay. I'm only her father.
wow, Pooh, you have your own TV?
Yeah, we can watch it later.
Hey, cool. A little monkey.
what a lovely room. - Thanks.
need anything before I go?
no, I'm all set, thanks. - Bye.
Zoey,
I want you to listen to Maisie's mother, otherwise I'm going to come back and there's not going to be a sleepover, all right?
okay. - Look.
okay, on the crown.
icing. Icing really hot. You got it?
you got the icing?
candy. Oh, candy.
Woo!
look at that slide. Slow move.
now put the...
fourth one on me.
Oops, sorry.
look. It's red, white, and green.
Wow.
let's go back inside.
Hey, listen to this. You guys hear that?
I really love how he weighs back on the beat.
Yeah, just want to get down.
that's you.
Yeah, yeah, it's good. - Yeah.
I'm going to find a whiskey.
# Hook and line I still blow away #
# With your Hook and line I still blow away #
# With your Hook and line I still blow away #
# With your Hook and line I still blow away #
Zoey.
don't cry, Zoey.
Oh.
this is the heart line.
and you're going to meet a very interesting man.
extraordinary.
Oh, hey. You're back.
hon, you're supposed to be in bed.
Zoey's crying.
Oh. I'm really sorry.
Hey, at this age...
Yeah, you know, at this age they don't...
um, all right.
thanks for coming.
good night. - Go.
Bye, Zoey. Bye.
Bye, Zoey.
go back to bed, baby, okay?
so much for them testifying for me.
fuck it.
the mom's a total Nazi anyway.
okay, Maisie, come on, which one?
that one.
you dressed yet?
we don't have time for that. We're late.
here. Put these on.
okay.
you can definitely mention the time he threw you.
he did? - Oh, my God, yeah.
he threw you across the room onto the couch yelling in your face.
Jesus. Don't you remember?
it was like your most earth-shattering moment.
Maisie?
do you and your mom sing together sometimes?
sometimes.
is it fun?
I hope you get what a farce this is.
it's ridiculous. We're not even married.
and listen, you know, whatever he says...
be sure to factor in thirty years of substance abuse.
do you want the chicken? - Uh-huh.
okay. Might be a little bit spicy.
how does that happen?
here you go.
Hello?
if you think it's all right.
your dad's coming up.
Hey.
Oh, my sixth favorite girl.
who's your other girls?
Oh, I can't tell you about those.
why not? - It's a secret.
do you want some Mandarin chicken?
mm, that sounds good. - Hi.
I think she's coming back soon. - I know.
I'm going to grab a few things and then we'll, uh, we'll keep this our little secret.
don't want to get Margo decapitated, no?
Uh-uh.
okay.
okay, I got to dash.
but don't worry. I'm fixing things, okay?
and, uh, thank you.
you're one in a million.
Hey.
okay, thanks. You're a prince.
that's Byron downstairs. She's on her way up.
Hey, up, up, up. Come on.
the doors don't open until ten after eight.
I've got to be at court in 15 minutes.
all right, I guess she can come in. - Thanks.
love you.
my mum says you're supposed to come with me.
to your house? - No, we're going to walk you home.
Bye. - Bye.
Hi, Maisie.
Hi, Byron.
you're not capable of taking care of a child.
you know better. - No, I know you.
Really? - Yes, yes.
I know you.
Susanna, you don't know anyone except yourself.
you breathe pain wherever you go. - Shut up, shut up.
that's why the judge and the expert, they saw that.
they saw you. - No.
then why are they not giving you sole custody?
because you got a female judge, that's why.
if that's what you want to tell yourself, then fine.
don't take her, man. - I'm not taking her.
don't take her. - I'm not taking her. They gave her to me.
Hey. - Hey, baby.
just the person we want to see.
honey, why don't you get some clothes and things and stuff to take with us?
just do it.
it's okay. It's okay.
she doesn't need you telling her what I say is okay, asshole!
temper, temper.
there you go.
I'm right behind you.
Hi, Maisie. - Hi.
can I take your bag?
you want to see your room?
so, what do you think?
you know, you have Margo to thank for... most of the stuff.
why don't I let you two catch up on the world events?
so, you surprised to see me?
it's kind of funny, huh?
hello. Hello.
hello. Hello.
how much?
that's academic. Look, no one in America has heard of him.
I don't know why but...
fine, okay, let's see.
okay, bye.
you can write in straight lines.
you got it.
I may need to take off to Italy in the next few weeks.
Oh.
so, you think you could, uh, keep an eye on Maisie?
okay, sure.
go on, start again. You know you're only supposed to do the first letter, right?
your passport is in order, right?
mine? - Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
good. Yeah.
because this work should only take a few days.
I thought after that maybe we could go on a little cruise in the Aeolian Islands, you know, say something like that.
Yeah. I've never been to Italy.
Oh.
or on a boat.
right, great. Well, then, that's good.
we'll do that. - We're going on a boat? When?
well, don't start packing just yet, okay?
it's all depending.
what's all this?
I got a flower delivery for Maisie Beale.
Maisie? Oh.
that's just... This is totally inappropriate.
get them back to the delivery guy.
the guy already left.
okay, I'll take it.
ten minutes and then homework, okay?
okay.
sweetie?
what are these?
I don't know.
but, I mean, did you put them in there?
Maisie?
mommy sent them.
Oh.
well, we should put them in some water.
can't I just keep them in the closet?
Why?
cause daddy threw them out.
Oh.
he's allergic.
Really?
I'll tell you what.
why don't we press a few, and then you can keep them forever?
that'll be our little secret, okay?
okay. - Why don't you pick some of your favorites?
okay.
I like this one.
this one. - Okay, here's our book.
and this one.
when we go back to Mommy's, can we bring Starbrite's corral?
um, sweetie, I'm not going with you.
Oh.
I'll be here when you get back.
okay.
so, where do we put the flowers? In the middle?
you put them in this side.
gently.
you know, your daddy's sad when you're not here, right?
so, um, it's nice for him to have someone around to... cheer him up.
and do the shopping and everything, too.
so, since we like each other, we thought that maybe I could do that.
how does that sound?
good.
let's do another. - Okay.
I think the roses would be too big.
Yeah. That one's nice.
try that one.
Oh, my baby, I missed you so much.
I missed you, too.
look.
Jesus.
Jesus, how did that happen?
I touched my arm on the stove and I got burned and I cried.
I bet you did.
I bet that hurt.
how did it happen? Did Daddy let you cook by yourself or something?
Oh, God. Okay.
the court says that I'm not supposed to say anything, but I would be, like, totally negligent if I didn't tell you that you really have to watch yourself when you're alone with Daddy, okay?
Margo was there.
Margo? You mean, you mean our Margo?
Margo who was at our house? That Margo?
you have a nice room at Daddy's?
Uh-huh, I have a canopy bed.
Oh, that's nice.
does Margo have a nice room?
it's tiny, and when you look out the window, there's a wall.
Ooh, daddy must not like her very much if he gives her a room like that.
he likes her.
yeah?
does he... Does he give her a kiss?
anything like that? Show her how much he likes her?
I don't know. - No?
no, huh?
Yes, yes, I'm sure. She just told me. Hang on a second.
Hey, baby, go play in your room for a little bit.
I'm going to finish this phone call, okay?
no, he's got her living with him.
what do you think I want? I want you to take that asshole back to court and get me sole custody.
Maisie?
careful, Maisie.
why would you be afraid of her?
I mean, fine, maybe she looks a little funny, but that's, like, really narrow minded.
I don't want you to grow up to be one of those people 'cause it's just not cool.
and you know what? She's the kind of nanny you're supposed to have.
I mean, she's not some tramp with a daddy fixation.
she smells funny. - She does not smell funny.
that's the way a nanny is supposed to smell.
come on.
okay, let's go.
come on, Maisie, let's go.
get your stuff, sweetie.
Hey, turn around.
you're going to see him soon enough. - I will?
you're going to be a flower girl. - I am?
Yeah, there's nothing he won't do.
here comes the fucking bride.
the collar is sticking up a little bit there.
Yeah, good.
Mrs. Beale, this is Principal Fairchild- Tettenbaum.
this is my third message. I would appreciate a call back.
thank you.
Maisie, are you sure your mother knows she's supposed to pick you up?
I don't know. - All right.
I'll figure something out.
Oh, Mais.
I thought that Maisie's mother was supposed to be doing pick up today.
she is. If my husband hadn't checked his messages at the airport, we'd be on a plane. I'm supposed to be on my honeymoon.
Hey, excuse me. Is this, uh...
susanna Nun. She sent me to get her daughter.
who are you?
uh, I'm her, uh, sort of like Maisie's stepfather.
you're what? - Yeah, I'm married to Susanna.
Hey.
how-how are you, Maisie? I'm Lincoln.
do you remember me? We met before a few weeks ago.
remember that? - I mean, this is...
we don't just release children to anyone walking into the office.
um, no, of course, no.
so, I've got Maisie, and I don't know what to do, so can you please call me back?
I can't get hold of him.
would you want to call Susanna?
just if you want to make sure I'm not some random...
I'm not going to call Susanna.
why don't you call her?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I can call.
Hey, it's me.
Yeah, no, it's good.
I'm outside the school here with Maisie, and Margo is here.
I understand.
Yeah, well, she doesn't really know who I am.
Yeah, all right. Just one second.
uh, it's Susanna.
Hello?
Yes.
I heard you.
okay, so I'll just take Maisie...
he... hello?
Susanna? Hello?
okay.
uh, I guess that's done.
Yeah, I guess.
I've got to go.
you need a cab? - Yeah.
I'll get you one.
Hey, taxi.
Hi.
okay, Maisie, I'll see you in ten days.
I don't want you to go.
it'll be okay, okay?
I promise.
I have to go.
I don't want to go with him.
Oh, Maisie.
I really, really love you. Okay?
okay.
see you in ten days, okay?
Bye, sweetie.
have a nice honeymoon.
Bye, Maisie.
please say bye.
JFK, please.
Yeah, we should probably wait.
she's lost it.
no, we need some more.
Oh, I'll be back. Baby just came home.
I have to kiss you.
mommy? - Yeah?
did you really get married?
Uh-huh. But I still love you the best.
and I'm still your mommy, right?
and, you know, he's just... he's just like a friend.
you don't have to call him Daddy or anything.
just like... just like you don't call Margo mommy, right?
you can just call him Lincoln.
did you have a flower girl?
Oh, you know what? If we did, it would've been you.
but we kept it really low key, and, um, it was just like with a Justice of the Peace kind of thing.
we didn't even have a cake.
no cake? - No cake.
sad but true.
here, want to see something?
you want to see what he gave me? Look at this.
look at that. - It's tiny.
it is tiny, isn't it?
tiny, tiny, little one.
Hey.
Hey. - Sorry.
it's okay. Come on in.
I... I got to go to work actually.
okay.
it was nice seeing you again, Maisie.
say goodbye to Lincoln.
Bye. - Bye.
how tall he is. He's so tall.
does he always work at night? - Yeah.
he's pretty much just a bartender, but you know, whatever.
it's good, so when I'm working, he can watch you.
it's going to be good.
can I tell you a secret?
I married him for you.
I married him for you.
# Sleep tight On the night train #
# No pain #
# I don't remember #
# Oh a couple Of years #
# Did some Good for you #
# No your eyes #
Hey, it's too thin.
I want to do a couple more, and then I want to hear it doubled, okay?
you go it.
what are you making?
is it a palace? - It's a castle.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.
it's beautiful.
you're really good.
I don't know how to make one of those... bridges.
like a drawbridge?
well, just, um, if you make the doorway here and then like the bridge going down and then some chains.
that's it. With a moat.
I can't do it.
you do it.
but it's your drawing.
Really? Okay.
maybe you can draw some animals in the moat, some dangerous animals so people can't swim across.
crocodiles and some polar bears and stuff that will eat you.
okay.
I haven't used a crayon in a really, really long time.
when I was a kid, I read this story about a family, and their car broke down in the desert.
and do... do you know how they survived? - How?
they ate crayons and paste.
EW. - It sounded pretty good to me.
I used to sneak paste to eat when I was a kid. - You did?
# I don't remember #
# Ooh a couple... #
the stuff we had was really good.
delicious. You should try it. - No.
no? - Hey.
you want to come in the booth with me while I sing?
okay. - Come on.
Hey. You didn't say goodbye.
Yes, I did. - No, you didn't.
I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you so much.
okay. All right.
I'll see you in ten days, okay? Bye, baby.
you cannot tell him, so that you really can't show him.
excuse me. - Excuse me.
who's that?
Hey. What are you still doing here?
um, ok... Le... let's go. Let's go and check.
no, no, he didn't forget. He knows it's his pick up day.
honeymoon my ass. He's messing with me.
look, it's a violation of the court order, and he agreed to those dates before he left.
you got to be kidding me.
great, okay.
so, he says it's a violation of the court order for them to not let us pick her up.
but if they don't pick her up, it's not a violation, okay?
he knows it's his pick up day.
maybe... - What, what, what?
we could go back to the court again. - No, no.
I'm not subjecting myself to that bullshit.
where are my cigarettes?
Jesus.
a witch hunt, that's what it is.
Hey, are you hungry?
do you get to make all the food for everyone?
uh, no.
I'm just... I'm just a bartender.
do you get lots of money?
well, I get tips.
but not lots of money. I wouldn't say that, no.
do you think it's important to make lots of money?
Uh-huh. - How come?
so you can be rich. - Oh, of course, so you can be rich.
what if you like doing something where you don't make lots of money?
like what? - Like being a teacher.
or maybe you want to be a nurse.
or a fireman. - Or a bartender.
Yeah, or a bartender.
for now.
here we go.
bon appetit.
I... I thought you said you liked eggs.
I don't want to ruin it.
okay, see you later.
you're supposed to walk me in.
are you sure we don't say bye here?
Really?
okay.
Maisie has something she'd like to share with the class.
this is my new stepfather.
Hi.
my father married my nanny, so court made my mommy get married, too.
Tyler. - I've two stepfathers.
but one is almost dead.
and most castles had 50 rooms and were in England.
if someone hurt your animal or tried to be rich, they would be killed and put in jail.
a lot of people in jail hurt their-selves so that they could go to the hospital and have food.
they ate stale bread, and then gave the bread to the homeless.
the end. Life in a Castle by Maisie Elizabeth Beale.
Wow.
that's amazing.
what am I, invisible?
you know, you don't get a bonus for making her fall in love with you.
Hey, baby, why don't you go to your room for a little while so Lincoln and I can talk, okay?
dude, how am I supposed to go away on to work and leave her with you when you're full of shit?
what are you talking about? And when did this tour come?
you deliberately undermine me.
why does everything have to be such a nightmare?
you know, I've turned into this like petty...
I don't recognize myself anymore.
you know, baby, all I wanted was for him to make things easier for us.
your story is very cool.
thank you.
Hey.
what are you thinking about?
nothing.
no?
you want to come to work with me tomorrow?
maybe you could help me pick out my costumes for the tour.
would you like that?
your dad's an asshole. He really is.
first he disappears, and then he shows up out of nowhere.
I don't know how to deal with this.
I really don't.
baby, I got to lie down.
lincoln, Beale's downstairs.
Hey.
come here.
whoa. You missed me? - Uh-huh.
Yeah, we were wondering when we were going to see you again.
you're the husband? - Yeah.
it's... it's the new husband.
my name is Lincoln. - It's Beale. Pleased to meet you.
nice to meet you.
I'd give you a couple of pointers but I doubt that the, uh,
jacoby and tragedy that was our relationship would apply to the farce that you two guys are playing out.
okay. - Okay.
anyway, good luck. - Yeah.
Bye, Maisie. - Whoa.
Bye.
thank you.
tall and young. Ha.
it's funny. He's so not her type.
hilarious.
how's your mom?
fine.
happy?
Uh-huh.
a word that sounds like owl?
Tyler. - Clown.
clown. Excellent. - Victor.
town. - Town.
Maisie. - Sound.
sound. Good.
which is your favorite?
I like the blue one.
it's getting late, Mais. We should go.
are we still going on a boat with Daddy?
what boat, sweetie?
in Italy, like he said.
um, I don't know. Maybe.
are you and Daddy still married?
of course.
it's not like pretend?
no. Why would you ask that?
I don't know.
Oh, Mais.
come on, Beale, you didn't even tell us you were leaving.
first, we were going to be coming with you, and then it was only going to be for a few days.
when are you coming back?
what do you mean you don't know?
hold on.
what are you doing up?
does your throat still hurt?
it's not time for your medicine, yet.
I'm talking to your father in London.
can I talk to him?
here's Maisie.
daddy?
I don't feel good.
no.
I miss you, too.
it's me.
I don't know. I told you.
they were supposed to pick her up three days ago.
it would just be nice to know when anything is going to happen about anything.
okay.
no.
I should just go.
right. Bye.
I'll be right back.
you're three days late. It's 10: 00 at night, and she's not well.
it's okay. We'll take a taxi.
it's not okay. She's got a temperature of 101.
it's...
Hey.
Oh. You're not feeling well, are you?
I have the bug.
Oh, the bug.
that sounds bad.
why didn't you come? - I'm sorry.
there was this whole mix up and...
well, kind like three mix ups actually.
I have to take my medicine in an hour.
okay. Okay.
so, what do you want me to do?
susanna is going to kill me.
come back in a day or two. - A day or...
I can't come back tonight without her.
susanna is going on tour this weekend.
lincoln, she's a child. She's not well.
I'll see you in a couple of days.
okay?
get some rest, so you feel better, okay?
Goodnight.
that one.
good choice.
Hey. Mommy.
no, we need some of...
baby, let me show you this bus.
it's good, huh?
you got ice-cream. You got chocolate.
you want one of these?
hang on tight. You got it? - I got it.
cool.
I... I can't talk right now.
good, here we go.
here we go, baby.
I can't see anything.
one, two, three, cheese.
Hey, baby, look, there's Lincoln.
come on, let's go.
it sucks that we don't have more time together.
but you know I love you more than anything, right?
okay?
I do.
okay, go.
watch out.
okay.
okay, bye.
hotel room.
she's in the bathroom for like 15 minutes.
I'm watching television...
and she comes out of the bathroom buck naked.
I'm like, okay, fine...
I push her up against the glass...
your order, sir.
do you want to come sit over here instead, by the cherries?
it's more fun over there.
is it okay if she sits here?
it's fine.
check this out.
Hello?
Ooh!
I can't hear you!
it's like you're a monkey.
Oh.
you got an eye on that?
don't. - Is that it?
again?
Yeah, I'll try. I'll call you back.
Hey, Maisie? Come here a minute.
they called from... from work, and someone is sick today, so I'm going to have to go in and work probably.
I could go with you again.
no.
no, we... We can't do that.
it's not a good idea.
don't bite your nails.
you ate glue. - Yeah.
all right, wise guy, come on, let's go.
I'm not a guy. I'm a girl.
Yeah, come on, wise girl.
what if she's not here?
I don't know.
maybe Caroline can come.
no, Caroline's got a boyfriend.
come on.
can I go to work with you then? - No, you can't.
Oh, we'll... we'll figure something out.
I know it's late over there, Beale.
I've been stuck in this hallway for an hour.
just tell the guy at the door to come up here and let me in.
Hi.
what are you doing here?
well, I... I know it hasn't been ten days, yet.
but I... - He has to go to work.
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh, you know, things have been a little rough with her mother gone and... and all.
right.
you know, I was just thinking like we're both in...
you thought what?
that I feel sorry for you?
that I've got nothing else to do?
that I'm just that sort of person?
well, I'm not, so you deal with it.
it's your problem, not mine.
I didn't... I didn't say that.
I am locked out of my own apartment because my husband didn't bother putting me on the lease.
like I don't exist.
I have done everything I was supposed to.
he can't use people like this.
I... I didn't realize that...
I'm really sorry.
just go.
please. - Yeah.
come on, Maisie.
I'm sorry.
you know I didn't mean you, don't you?
thank you.
none of this is your fault.
I'll see you later, Maisie.
it's not Lincoln's fault, either.
he's just mixed up, too.
you really like him, don't you?
I love him.
I'm sorry I got mad at him.
he must think I'm awful.
mommy gets mad at him all the time.
there he is.
Hey, Maisie.
Hey. - Hi.
I did the icing but it's from her because she's sorry she got mad at you.
Oh. A cake.
I told her that you like chocolate.
I do like chocolate.
thank you. Thank you both.
uh, you guys hungry?
yeah? I know someone who works here so I might be able to get you a table.
you work here.
Yeah, I guess you're right. I do work here.
uh, come on.
you know what some people eat here?
what? - Raw hamburger with raw eggs on it.
EW.
these are from Lincoln.
would you eat a raw hamburger with a raw egg on it?
never. Would you?
glasgow has got such a vibe and a lot of culture.
it's so funny 'cause, like, to me you don't have a very thick Scottish accent when you say Glasgow, Glasgow. That's nice.
Yeah, it is, it is.
Yeah, I always wonder if I'll be now.
thank you for the cake and tonight.
Yeah.
okay.
Goodnight.
morning. - Morning.
how did you sleep? - Good.
what do you want for breakfast?
mm, I don't know.
pancakes.
okay. Pancakes it is.
Lincoln.
sorry I'm late.
the wolf is scaring her grandma.
Oh, bummer.
she's chasing the wolf there.
okay, higher. Higher.
don't get too close. - There are so many.
this is really cool.
I can't believe I haven't been here before.
look, see, there's a baby turtle.
whoa.
look at that guy. He's checking you out.
so many of them.
this is great.
Yeah, I like it here.
you know what? - What.
you could buy turtles on the street.
they keep them in buckets, and they're only $1.
Really? Wow. - I was bitten by a turtle once.
were you really? - Yeah, yeah.
it even left a scar if you...
big?
it could've left a scar.
it's that bad. It could've left a scar. Right, yeah.
so, is it quite traumatic for you being here with the turtles?
this is kind like therapy for me. - Oh, it is? Okay.
meeting the beast again.
that's the last one until after dinner, okay?
daddy.
we'll do this. - Daddy!
Hey, my favorite girl.
Hey, you got heavy.
what a surprise. - Yeah, I had a change of schedule.
I can smell candy.
we went to go see a puppet show. - Did you now?
red Riding Hood. - Oh, that's scary.
I was just about to make some dinner.
Ah, not for me, thanks. I ate on the plane.
Yuck.
I got a couple of calls to make, but I'll join you guys later.
come on, Maisie, we should get washed up.
Oh, hey, sweetie.
where is Margo?
Pff.
maybe she went for a long walk.
let's go get breakfast.
I, uh,
I don't need to tell you things are a bit of a mess since your mom ran off.
she's on a big tour.
not so big from what I hear.
but, uh, be that as it may,
um, I may have to go back to England.
um, couple of, you know, business opportunities, and your grandmother is not getting any younger.
you... you understand?
can I come? We can... we can get the coins.
coins? What coins?
like your daddy found in the ground when you were little.
you remember me telling you that?
maybe we can find some more.
would you like that? Yeah? Just the two of us?
you and your old man digging for coins?
I could do with a few.
why not? Your mother would have a fit.
but I don't think I'd have a problem squaring it with the judge after she ditched with that bartender.
sure I could settle with Margo without any legal nonsense.
why not?
why not? Why not?
will I get back in time?
for what? - To go to Mommy's.
this wouldn't be a day excursion, you know that.
this would be like a permanent thing.
all the time? - All the time.
maybe Mommy would like to live there, too.
no, there's no Mommy in England.
you can't...
there's a whole ocean.
it's...
you know, England is, um...
england is pretty cold, actually.
it rains a lot.
and, um, and we need to have to rethink, you know.
and you're on the fence, I can see that.
I think you'd be happier here.
all the same.
um, the good news is that when I visit America for work,
I can see you, too.
does your nose still make that squeaky noise when you press it?
okay. You would have laughed at that when you were four years old.
don't deny it.
take care, Mr. Beale. - Sure.
Bye.
okay, bye.
have a safe trip now.
Quinn, 8B.
Volgo, 11E.
Remmy, 9C.
laporte, penthouse.
Remmy, 9C.
1a. Laporte, penthouse.
I thought your father was away.
well, he was here when we came from the puppets.
well, I can't really watch you now.
I got to be in Chinatown in half an hour, and I'm sort of late already.
is it still Margo's week?
she and daddy had a fight, and this morning she was gone.
gone?
where did she go? - I don't know.
but Daddy's going to England, and he said that I could go with him and then he said that I couldn't.
and then we came in a taxi and he left me here.
well, that's a lot.
okay, I'll... Why don't...
I'll call Margo. See if I can find her.
it'll be okay.
Oh, there she is.
Hey. - Hey.
Thanks.
thanks for coming.
Yeah, of course I came.
what if they don't have a turtle?
I'm sure we'll find one somewhere.
okay, well, actually I have to go this way.
but I'll see your turtle when I get home, okay?
thanks for your help. - Okay, well, just call me.
mommy!
Oh, my God, baby.
I'm so happy to see you.
we're going to get a turtle.
a turtle? A turtle?
so, what are you two doing with my daughter?
what are you talking about? - Looking after her while you're on tour.
what are you, like a stalker?
what are you going to stiff me next, huh?
so, what are you two doing together, huh?
what am I doing? What are you doing?
what are you doing?
I'm back for half a day. - Oh, yeah?
cars are coming. - Hey, hey, hey!
do you mind? I have a kid here.
what the fuck? What are you doing?
really, what are you doing? - What are you doing?
I'm taking my daughter, that's what.
get out of my face.
I'll love to get out of your face.
you don't deserve her.
I'm done.
let's go get the turtle. Let's go get it.
let's go get the turtle.
do you like it?
it's what you wanted, right? - Uh-huh.
Yeah.
what do you want to do?
hungry or anything?
you want something to eat? - No, thanks.
you know, I didn't even know we were stopping in New York.
okay? - Okay.
yeah?
okay.
this turtle is pretty cool, you know.
want to come to our house?
want to come to our house, turtle?
no, I don't... I don't care what you tell him.
just say that I have laryngitis or something or mercury poisoning, all right?
just get me out of it.
no, I'm not leaving her.
goddammit, come on.
what am I supposed to do?
I can't go back on the road right now.
I can't. No, I'm not going to.
Jesus, what do you expect me to do?
Hey, baby.
honey, wake up. Okay, wake up. We got to go.
it really sucks but we got to go. Come on.
okay, baby.
I am so sorry but I have... I got to go.
I just can't miss another show right now because I'll have a massive loss and I just can't handle that right now.
okay? But you know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to have you full now for a couple of shows and then we can hang out for a while and then maybe we could sing a duet together.
is that too phony?
okay, uh, you can hang out here with Lincoln until he's finished work and then he's going to take you home, okay?
I love you so much.
I got to go, baby.
Maisie.
I'm going to wait till you go inside, okay?
it's all right.
Hey, hon. Remember me?
Where's Lincoln? - He's not on tonight.
who are you with?
my mom put me here so that I could stay with him.
well, let me talk to your mom. - She left.
Hi, still serving? - Absolutely.
um... stay right here, okay?
I'll be right back.
right this way.
I'll keep making calls and see if I can find him.
thanks for doing this. - No problem. See you tomorrow.
what are you doing up?
Hey, kid.
Where's Margo? I want to go home.
Where's Margo? - You're going to stay here tonight, remember?
it's going to be fine. Let's go back to bed.
no, I want to go home. I want to go home. - Come here.
please, I want to go home.
it's okay.
it's going to be fine.
just a couple of things, okay, sweetie? - Okay.
what about my turtle?
we'll get the turtle.
and you know what?
what? - My cousin told me where the key is.
guess where it is? - Where?
it's under the mat on the back door.
you're going to be okay with your bag?
Uh-huh.
Oh, God.
God, don't do this.
there's an upstairs.
Yeah, you want to go see?
it's cold.
feels good.
look.
what if someone buys the house? Where would we go?
it doesn't happen that fast.
what if we had to go somewhere else?
how would people know where we are?
we tell them. - What if we couldn't find them?
we'd find them and we'd tell them.
anyway, I told them where we were so they wouldn't be worried.
dinner's ready.
what do you think this should be?
probably a window. - A window?
Hey, Maisie. - Come on.
okay, let's go to the beach.
can you hear the ocean? - Shh.
Yes. - You can?
Wow.
okay. - Two pails.
two pails?
let's trade.
there you go.
Lincoln!
Lincoln!
Hey.
Hey.
how are you?
want to see my room?
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to see your room.
of course. Of course.
I'd love to see your room. - Hey.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
it's not working again.
it's not working again.
I got it.
there's a place in the back where we can get worms.
and we can go on the boat next door whenever we want.
Oh, wow. Perfect.
we can go tomorrow if you want to. Lincoln just got here.
how long are you staying? - Well, definitely long enough to go on the boat.
it's beautiful here.
uh, I brought you something from the city I thought you might like.
wait, I'll show you something.
there's a picture that I thought might be interesting.
look at that. Look.
you know why? - Why?
I was thinking we might want this guy.
we can put him in our moat.
in our moat, that was what I was thinking. Perfect.
you guys have a moat? - Of course.
okay.
what's that? - Look at that.
do you want to pick it up? Maisie.
gently, gently. It's holding onto the rock.
look, he's moving.
he's moving.
he's waving at you.
you're going to hold my hand? - Yeah.
okay. Don't stand on him.
could we go on the boat tomorrow?
why don't you ask the fishermen when they get back?
hold on. Hold on.
he said we could go tomorrow!
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
I want to buy it.
you already have it.
I want to buy a hotel. Can I have two?
Yeah.
fifty?
are you kidding me? You can't even buy a hostel.
you got to do better than that. Give me a little more.
two hotels you got to pay. Give me, uh...
Oh, how generous of you. You don't even get a sleeping bag for that.
we weren't allowed to play Monopoly when I was a kid.
what did you play instead? - This Swiss doctor made some games.
they're supposed to instill cooperation and pacifism.
that's probably why you're losing. - Yeah. Ha, ha, ha.
in my house, it was every man for himself.
Oh, thanks for the warning.
what's funny? - You are.
Yeah, you are. You are so funny. - You are so funny.
thank you. Okay.
no. - Go to jail.
Oh, come on. I need some luck now.
it's not fair.
surprise.
Ah, oh.
Oh, my little beach bunny.
Hey, guess what? I'm playing Virginia Beach tomorrow night.
I found this really nice girl with a dog who can watch you during the show.
and then after that we go to North Carolina and Tennessee.
what kind of a dog? - I don't know.
but, um, it's kind of a long drive, so if you want to say goodbye to these guys, you'd better hurry up.
okay, go ahead. Go on.
or you can just come back to the bus and we can take off and you can open all the presents I got you.
you want to do that?
I want to meet the dog but maybe the day after.
well, baby, the day after I'm playing Raleigh, so I got to go.
okay, come on. Come on, let's go, babe. Come on, come on.
what's up? What's the matter? Come on.
we're supposed to go on a boat tomorrow.
baby, we can go on a boat any day, okay? It's not a big deal.
we got to go. Come on, let's go.
come on. Come on.
Maisie, come on.
don't you want to come?
fine.
why did I fucking bother?
God, what is it? You just decided you don't like me anymore?
is that it?
what, are you scared of me?
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry.
I don't want you to be scared.
I'm an idiot, you know.
I'm, um...
Hey, Maisie, Maisie, baby, you know what?
I really love you.
I really do.
before you where born, I... I didn't know it was possible to love somebody as much as I love you.
you're just like my, my little baby.
can I tell you something?
a long time ago I was just like you.
I was just like you.
you want to go on a boat tomorrow?
you want... to stay with them for a while?
you know who your mother is, right?
you.
let's go open your presents.
come on.
all right, you got to tell me how big you want it.
that's good.
that's good? - That's good.
do you know where the filters are?
um, on the table.
look at that little baby pancake.
that's tiny. I want a big pancake.
shall we do another one?
you ready? - I want a big one.
you want a big one? This one's very big. - Okay, good.
come on, hurry up.
is the divorce over?
are spirit and science tying the knot once more?
are the church and the laboratory saying the same thing?
out of the misty ages of antiquity...
the quest for the divine and the quest for knowledge about the universe...
marched hand in hand.
ancient Sumer - There was a god of astronomy...
a god of horticulture, a god of irrigation...
and the temple priests were the scribes and technologists...
investigating these fields of knowledge.
ancient Greece- Philosophers asking the questions of why are we here...
developed the theory of the atom, celestial movements and human ethics.
medieval Europe- The Western church arose to a position of supreme power.
kingmaker, landowner and purveyor of the truth...
the church took it upon themselves to be the one knower of everything.
the dogma was law.
yet science had moved forward...
and now challenged the dogma that the Earth was the center of the universe.
Copernicus, Bruno and Galileo all felt the heavy hand of the church.
the tragedy!
unable to suppress science anymore...
the church and science divided up knowledge and human endeavor.
descartes invented dualism.
the church had the unseen...
science the seen.
and materialism was born.
an uneasy truce.
scientists were no longer being bound...
and they reacted with a vengeance.
all the unseen is fantasy, delusion.
we are strictly little machines running in a predictable machine universe...
governed by strict, immutable laws.
the church pushed back.
soulless scientists were condemned to hell!
darwin countered. The creator is nothing, nowhere.
we are random mutations...
simply a carrier of D. N.A. 's relentless quest for more in a meaningless universe.
and meanwhile, both science and religion were hitting the wall.
if everything was mechanistic and God was the Holy Creator...
then what were we humans supposed to do?
science dug ever deeper into a dead universe...
and stumbled upon and unlocked a mystery.
in tiny corners of space and time...
scientists found unfathomable energy...
and mind-numbing mysteries.
mysteries that suggest we are all connected...
that the physical universe is essentially nonphysical.
time and space Are just constructs of this non-materialness.
and today, renegade scientists are meeting with religious leaders.
conferences pushing forward a meeting of science and spirit are springing up.
as the 20th century blew open the doors of a mechanistic view...
will the 21st century blow down the iron wall between the church and laboratory?
this is your IsNewsReal reporter... signing off.
the rabbit hole and how deep and how far we want to go...
is really how far, how much do you want to discover about your true nature?
Alice went down the rabbit hole, where she met the Mad Hatter.
the hatter was mad.
and the idea was, you want to get out of the rabbit hole after you've gone in.
so there's two stages to science.
there's- There's the crazy part, where you go down the rabbit hole...
and then there's the part where you check the craziness of your ideas...
against a rigorous, strict straitjacket-like process.
I think the interesting thing about science...
um, um, the interesting thing about physics...
is that it is a genuinely new and novel way...
of trying to come to grips with the world.
um, um, I think the experimental method, which is important to physics...
is a very different business from the method of revelation...
or the method of meditation or something like that.
I don't think it's true that, for example...
adherents of, say, Buddhism...
um, um, could imagine changing their beliefs... based on the outcomes of some experiments people do with electrons.
why this apparent rift between the church and science...
or between science and religion emerged today?
I think the roots of that are very deep...
because it probably goes back to a conviction...
that some of the books of the scriptures like the Book of Genesis, which deals with beginnings...
is actually telling us about the origins of the world.
now, in fact, any biblical scholar will tell you
this is not news- that the Book of Genesis was never meant to be about the origins of the world.
but many churchmen believed that in the Book of Genesis...
you had actual sort of live news, like CNN，about the beginnings of creation.
and, therefore, you had many people down through the ages...
like the famous Archbishop James Ussher in Ireland in 1 650...
who calculated all the ages of the patriarchs back along...
and worked out, to his own satisfaction，that the creation of the world occurred in the year 4004 B. C. on the 17th of September at 9: 00 in the morning.
I think that there must be a scientific explanation for spirituality.
I don't think there's been a good one until recently.
to me, the only one that makes sense is that...
proto-consciousness, Platonic values, goodness, truth...
exist at this fundamental level of space-time geometry...
which can influence our actions if we're open to them...
and interconnects us to all other beings to the universe at large.
science creates the stories that we live by...
and science has told us a very bleak story.
it's told us that we're some sort of genetic mistake that we have genes that use us, basically, to move on to the next generation...
and that we randomly mutate.
it's said that we are outside of our universe...
that we're alone, that we are separate...
and that we are this sort of lonely mistake on a lonely planet in a lonely universe.
and that informs our view of the world.
it informs our view of ourselves.
and we're now realizing that this view...
this view of separateness，is one of the most destructive things.
it's the thing that creates all the problems in the world.
and we're now realizing that that paradigm is wrong, that we aren't separate.
we are all one. We're all together.
at the very nethermost element of our being, we are connected.
and so we're trying to understand and absorb what are the implications of that?
what does this really mean to me and my life?
we need a new spiritual milieu.
we need a new spiritual way of understanding the nature of what it is to be a human being.
because the old ways, the old mythologies，the old monarchy, king, God... versus the old lawful scientist's way of doing everything are dead.
they need to be buried. We need a new realm, a new vision.
and I think quantum physics, if anything could help us get a step up in the right direction.
I think the key aspect of the new paradigm
at least in medicine, which is my little piece um, is that consciousness is real and has an impact.
we have to go beyond our senses to create a new paradigm.
it may very well be that what's going on inside of you in your brain, in your nervous system, in your nature of observation...
how memory works, how mind works
it may very well be that what is happening there...
is some kind of observer/matter interrelationship...
which is indeed making things real for you, affecting how you perceive reality.
it's not changing the reality out there.
you know, you're not changing big chairs and big trucks and bulldozers and rockets taking off.
you're not changing those. No.
but you're changing how you perceive things and maybe how you think about the things， how you feel about things, how you sense the world.
the infinite information that the brain is processing every single second...
tells us that there's more to the world than we're perceiving
however, every single time we're immersed in an experience with our senses - seeing, smelling, tasting, feeling
as we're immersed sensually in our reality.
we know nothing about reality and all of our sense of so-called reality out there is filtered through our sense organs.
the brain processes 400 billion bits of information a second...
but we're only aware of 2, 000 of those
that means that reality's happening in the brain all the time.
you should try it
how do I know what I'm doing?
I and the vase are one.
Hey, it might help your work too
I live through my eyes.
I deal in reality.
not just some nebulous, nothing, touchy-feely world of shifting whatevers.
if it's real, I want to see it.
the eyes are, in some senses, a camcorder...
because they are taking that information...
and they're storing it, but they're not- You're not really able to get it to mean anything until you actually put it all together.
so in some senses, it requires the editor's table to really put the whole thing together...
to put the movie together of what your life and your world is actually about.
if I get out of bed in the morning, okay...
and I suddenly decide, um, to take very seriously, the claim-which is surely a true claim that I don't know for sure if my eyes are working correctly, okay?
so that for all I know, even though it looks like there's a stable floor by the side of my bed, there might be a cliff or something like that, okay?
um, if I am unable to order those possibilities in terms of probabilities that I assign to them then I'm not gonna get out of bed.
seems to me I'm paralyzed in the most literal sense of the word, okay?
I'm not, um, um
I'm gonna have no idea how to literally take the next step.
it's definitely the case that we know that my eyes might in principle be deceiving me at any moment.
we've had experience of people before, subject to hallucinations.
and even if we didn't we don't know how to prove as a fundamental matter that our eyes never deceive us.
that's absolutely right.
but when we make the decision to get out of bed in the morning...
we are assigning probabilities to the various hypotheses compatible with my seeing a floor by the bed.
one hypothesis is, there really is a floor there, and that's why I'm seeing it.
another hypothesis is...
my seeing the floor is a hallucination, and there's a cliff there.
by getting out of bed in the morning...
you endorse one of those hypotheses as more likely than another.
well, ultimate reality, I think... very frequently depends a lot on how a person perceives it and what they actually think is，is the real reality of our world.
if the brain is processing 400 billion bits of information and our awareness is only on 2, 000
that means reality's happening in the brain all the time.
it's receiving that information, and yet we haven't integrated it.
but if we're given knowledge and information outside of convention -outside the box of convention
or say we merged quantum physics and neurophysiology and the brain is asked to contemplate，or we're-we're asked to contemplate on that and examine the what-ifs and possibilities and potentials and associate our knowns with our experience of what we know and repeat it over and over again the brain's gonna start to integrate two independent neuronets and it's gonna create a new vision
and that new vision's gonna be like taking a flashlight
and that new vision's gonna be like taking a flashlight and shining it from those 2, 000 bits of information that have to do with our body and our environment and time slightly over, in the dark and looking at something new.
that's called realization.
you okay? I heard you scream earlier. Was it another dream?
you were an Indian watching Columbus's ship materialize out of thin air.
Wow!
and this medicine man kept hitting you.
cool! That's- Hey. Maybe it was a past life or a parallel reality, or a future life.
get real.
or maybe that dream was trying to tell you the truth.
I guess it just depends on what you think is real.
maybe you should try different anxiety pills.
my pills are fine, okay? Thank you.
well, I have to go get dressed.
I hope you feel better, Amanda.
God, Amanda. You can be such an asshole.
people ask me, why does quantum mechanics matter, given that it's all
it's little tiny stuff, And who cares?
there are three possible answers.
from a practical point of view, it doesn't make any difference at all.
you still have to go to work, drive your car and do all the rest of it.
from a second point of view, it actually- it infiltrates everything in the world, especially the world of electronics.
when you go to the supermarket and you do the scanning at the checkout
but I think the important part is the third one which is essentially a philosophical issue.
why are philosophers so passionate about deconstruction the assumptions of the world?
I finally got it. I got it as a result of looking at quantum mechanics and comparing it to classical mechanics.
they present two very different ways of thinking about the way that the world works and about what we are.
so, from a classical perspective, we are machines.
and in machines, there's no room for a conscious experience.
doesn't matter if a machine dies.
you can kill the machine. You can throw it in the dump. It doesn't matter.
if that is the way that the world is, then people will behave in that way.
but there's another way of thinking about the world.
it's pointed to by quantum mechanics which suggested that the world is not this clockwork thing but it's more like an organism
it's a highly interconnected organismic thing of some type which extends through space and time.
in that kind of environment, what I think and the way that I behave has a much greater impact, not only on myself, but on the rest of the world than it would if it was a classical world.
so, from a very basic point of view having to do with morals and ethics what I think affects the world.
that's- I mean, in a sense, that's really the key for why a worldview change is important.
let's talk about the subatomic world.
and then we'll talk about what it's telling us about reality.
the first thing I want to tell you about the subatomic world is it's totally a fantasy created by mad physicists trying to figure out what the heck is going on when they do these little experiments.
by little experiments, I mean big energy in little spaces and little pieces of time.
it gets pretty nutty at that realm of things.
and so subatomic physics was invented to try to figure that all out.
we need a new science down there. It's called quantum physics, and it is subject to a whole range of debatable hypotheses, thoughts, feelings, intuitions...
as to what the heck is really going on.
so, on the one hand, you had a theory which from the conceptual standpoint, was profoundly puzzling and on the other hand, from the practical standpoint was vastly more successful than anything we had ever seen before.
this is the kind of situation that produces the tension that all of the investigations of- foundations of quantum mechanics are feeding off of since then.
because on the one hand, this is a- this is an acutely paradoxical, puzzling, conceptually confusing theory.
on the other hand, we have no option along the lines of throwing it out，or neglecting it because it is the most powerful proven tool for predicting the behaviors of physical systems that we have ever had in our hands.
the universe is very strange. There seem to be two sets of laws that govern the universe.
in our everyday classical world, meaning roughly our size and timescales things are described by Newton's laws of motion set down hundreds and hundreds of years ago.
and they work very well for billiard balls and cannonballs and gravity.
however, when we get down to a small scale， when we get down to, say, the level of atoms a different set of laws take over.
these are the quantum laws, quantum theory, quantum mechanics.
and at that level particles may be in multiple places at the same time.
they may behave as waves smeared out spatially and temporally.
they may be interconnected over great distances.
they may, um，be unified into one quantum state- into one state governed by one wave function.
and the borderline, the threshold this curtain between the quantum world and the classical world is really mysterious.
it's called sometimes the collapse of the wave function because at the quantum world, everything is in superposition and multiple possibilities.
and in the classical world, these multiple possibilities seem to collapse to particular, definite choices.
so, everything is in one particular place.
quantum mechanics is really the play and display of information the play and display of potentiality, waves of information, waves of potential electron.
and it's important, the word "potential."
this isn't the world of electrons. It's the world of potential electrons.
but you have to ask the question, Waves of what really?
what is the field that is waving? Is it the ocean?
no. It's a universal ocean. An ocean of pure potentiality.
an ocean of abstract, potential existence.
we call it the "unified field, " or "superstring field."
and that's what we're made of.
connectivity among all things is a basic constituent of the fabric of reality.
it's very difficult to wrap your mind around that.
but Erwin Schrodinger said - He's one of the founders of quantum mechanics
that entanglement, which is this idea of this connectivity is not just a property of quantum mechanics, it's the property.
it's the property of quantum mechanics that makes it very, very strange.
and it doesn't seem to fit in with our ordinary world our ordinary experience, but, in fact, it actually does.
wanna shoot some hoops?
now, you don't have to be like that.
come on and play.
look, he likes you. Don't you have time for a little one-on-one?
how long has it been since you played?
come on. You got the ball. Take a shot.
no, no, no, milady. Not from there. It's out-of-bounds.
you gotta be on the court to be in play.
welcome to Duke Reginald's court of unending possibilities.
court rules. You gotta sink the last one.
that hurt.
it never touched you.
right.
and... it's not solid.
this ball. It's mostly empty.
we were all taught in school that the world is made of stuff of matter, of mass, of atoms
atoms make up molecules. Molecules make up materials. And everything is made of that.
but atoms actually are mostly empty.
for example, if this ball were the nucleus of an atom a proton in a hydrogen atom, for example then the electron circling this which would describe the outer limits of that atom would be out by that mountain over there, roughly 20 miles away.
and everything in between is empty.
in fact, the universe is mostly empty.
however, when we go down in scale, in the emptiness we eventually come to a level the fundamental level of space-time geometry.
the fine basement level of the universe where there's information, there's a pattern.
it's called the Planck scale. And it's the fabric of the universe.
and at that level, there's information that's been there since the big bang.
so most of the universe, even of matter, is actually empty.
most people think that the vacuum is empty.
but for internal self-consistency of quantum mechanics and relativity theory there is required to be the equivalent of 10 to the 94 grams of mass energy.
each gram being E = mc...2 kind of energy.
now, that's a huge number. But what does it mean practically?
practically, if I can assume that the universe is flat
and more and more astronomical data is showing it's pretty darn flat if I can assume that, then if I take the volume or take the vacuum within a single hydrogen atom that's about 10 to the minus 23 cubic centimeters.
if I take that amount of vacuum and I take the latent energy in that there is a trillion times more energy there than in all of the mass of all of the stars and all of the planets out to 20 billion light-years.
that's big. That's big.
and if consciousness allows you to control even a small fraction of that creating a big bang is no problem.
organizations like NASA, British Aerospace are all trying to tap into this incredible, unimaginably large energy sea.
and they feel if they can tap this, we can travel to different galaxies.
so they understand that in empty space, there is this unbelievable energy.
the major basic idea that quantum physics implies which makes us understand this or even think about this new paradigm the thing which is that there's this underground
there's gotta be a realm of existence which cannot be ever touched on or seen which bubbles into the existence giving rise to our understanding of the world.
the tighter physics have tried to grasp onto physical reality to understand what it's really made of， what are the core building blocks of life at the basis of it all life, the universe, slips through your fingers.
and you come up with something that's increasingly abstract increasingly abstract till they come to the realm of pure abstraction.
and that's what the unified field is.
it's pure abstract potential, pure abstract being, pure abstract self-aware consciousness which rises in waves of vibration, to give rise to the particles, the people, everything we see in the vast universe
what makes up things are not more things but what makes up things are ideas, concepts, information
and like I said, it never touches.
another strange fact is that objects never really touch each other.
when I dribble this ball, the atoms of the ball and the atoms of the ground never actually meet.
so nobody touches nothing.
come on. Put your stuff down. Nobody's gonna take it.
like I said, this is my court. It's no problem.
well, how long has it been?
I'll be late.
the first inkling in physics that we got that time ain't what it seemed to be uh, came with relativity.
that was the first inkling. That time was not absolute.
it was not the absolute ruler of the universe.
that God Almighty did not say, "One second, one second, one second, one second."
one meter, one meter, one meter.
you're in a gravitational field.
your head is actually moving at a slightly faster rate than your feet.
the second law of thermodynamics says that things unwind and move forward.
so that gives an arrow of time.
but at the quantum world, in the microworld the second law of thermodynamics doesn't seem to hold.
and things can go backwards or be timeless.
the fundamental equations of physics have a property which is referred to as time reversal symmetry
and what time reversal symmetry means is that a set of laws which are time reversal symmetric are laws that have the following feature
for any process that's in accord with those laws the same process going backwards is exactly as much in accord with those laws.
okay? That ought to mean that, um
that milk jumps out of coffee as often as it dissolves into it that people get younger-looking as often as they get older-looking that we have the same kind of access vis-a-vis knowledge to the future as we do to the past that by acting now we ought to be able to influence the past.
all of that is wrong.
all of that, that is, comes into violent conflict with the way we psychologically experience the world.
one of the most unpalatable ideas still in spite of the fact that quantum physics has been around a long time is the possibility or the notion that the future can have a causative effect on the present
we believe that the past can have a causative effect on the present.
I hold a ball. I drop it. It falls.
cause, effect, when it hits the ground.
but could the ground be the cause of my dropping the ball in the first place?
it's only in conscious experience that it seems we move forward in time.
in quantum theory you can also go backwards in time.
and there's some suggestion that processes in the brain related to consciousness project backwards in time
for example, in the late 1970s a neurophysiologist at University of California, San Francisco, named Ben Libet did some very famous experiments.
what Libet did was to study patients who were having neurosurgery on their brains with their brains exposed while they were awake. They were given a local anesthetic to numb the area of the skull and scalp to access their brains, and they were awake, and Ben would talk to these people.
so, for example, what he did was he would stimulate their little finger...
and look at the part of the sensory cortex on the opposite side that was related to that, record from it electrically and ask the patient when he or she felt the stimulus on the little finger.
he would also stimulate at that particular area of the cortex.
now, what you would think, would be that if you stimulate the little finger it takes a finite period of time to get to the opposite side of the cortex so the patient would report it a fraction of a second later after the stimulus
and when you stimulate it directly, the patient would report it immediately.
he found just the opposite.
when you stimulated the little finger, the patient felt it immediately.
and when he stimulated directly on the cortex, there was a delay.
after sorting through all the data and repeating this over and over
Libet came to the conclusion that somehow the brain was projecting information backwards in time.
so that it did take a finite amount of time to get to the sensory cortex but the brain projected it backwards in time so that the conscious perception was that the stimulus was felt when the pinch actually occurred.
there have been some studies which have shown that when people are beginning to move a hand or beginning to say something that there's actually activity in certain nerve cells of the brain even before they become consciously aware of what they're trying to do.
it seems to me I often do things and then decide later what to do but I've already done them.
I'll be late.
you can always go back in time.
what's the matter?
remember. It's empty.
how do you know this shit?
I read Dr. Quantum comics.
everybody thinks it's just kid stuff, but I know it's real.
it's how I do my magic on the court.
so, what they taught us in school isn't really the way it is.
and that our senses are playing tricks on us.
you just gotta wonder.
what is this reality that we find ourselves in?
quantum physics says it's all just waves of information.
do I believe that?
Ah, I hope so.
it's how I do my magic on the court.
Yeah. I always choose the wonder boy first.
Dr. Quantum says everybody's got it. Everybody's doing it.
and doing it constantly, each and every time we look.
and here we are, the granddaddy of all quantum weirdness:
the infamous double-slit experiment.
to understand this experiment, we first need to see how particles or little balls of matter, act.
if we randomly shoot a small object, say a marble, at the screen we see a pattern on the back wall where they went through the slit and hit.
now, if we add a second slit we would expect to see a second band duplicated to the right.
now, let's look at waves.
the waves hit the slit and radiate out striking the back wall with the most intensity directly in line with the slit.
the line of brightness on the back screen shows that intensity.
this is similar to the line the marbles make.
but when we add the second slit...
something different happens.
if the top of one wave meets the bottom of another wave they cancel each other out.
so now there is an interference pattern on the back wall.
places where the two tops meet are the highest intensity- the bright lines
and where they cancel, there is nothing.
so, when we throw things, that is, matter, through two slits we get this- two bands of hits.
and with waves, we get an interference pattern of many bands.
good, so far. Now, let's go quantum.
an electron is a tiny, tiny bit of matter like a tiny marble.
let's fire a stream through one slit.
it behaves just like the marble: a single band.
so if we shoot these tiny bits through two slits we should get, like the marbles, two bands.
what? An interference pattern.
we fired electrons, tiny bits of matter, through.
but we get a pattern like waves not like little marbles.
how? How could pieces of matter create an interference pattern like a wave?
it doesn't make sense.
but physicists are clever.
they thought, "Maybe those little balls are bouncing off each other，and creating that pattern."
so they decide to shoot electrons through one at a time.
there is no way they could interfere with each other.
but after an hour of this, the same interference pattern is seen to emerge.
the conclusion is inescapable.
the single electron leaves as a particle becomes a wave of potentials goes through both slits and interferes with itself to hit the wall like a particle.
but mathematically, it's even stranger.
it goes through both slits and it goes through neither. And it goes through just one，and it goes through just the other.
all of these possibilities are in superposition with each other.
but physicists were completely baffled by this.
so they decided to peek and see which slit it actually goes through.
they put a measuring device by one slit to see which one it went through and let it fly
but the quantum world is far more mysterious than they could've imagined.
when they observed, the electron went back to behaving like a little marble.
it produced a pattern of two bands not an interference pattern of many.
the very act of measuring, or observing which slit it went through meant it only went through one, not both.
the electron decided to act differently...
as though it was aware it was being watched.
and it was here that physicists stepped forever into the strange, never-world of quantum events
what is matter, marbles or waves?
and waves of what?
and what does an observer have to do with any of this?
the observer collapsed the wave function simply by observing.
we are always the observer.
but sometimes we identify with the events so much
that's why the materialist gets totally lost and thinks that we could do without the observer.
so that we even lose the aspect of the observer
the physics data tells us that the
that an object itself is really a simplification for what's we call "out there.
one is particularly - When we're looking at atomic and subatomic particles or atomic and subatomic matter in any form what we find is how we go to look at it...
or what we choose to examine it with...
actually changes the properties of what we observe to be out there.
is this the observer...
and which is so intricate to understanding the wacky, weird world of quantum particles and how they react?
is this then the observer?
and even though we cannot have a quantum field without the observation of scientists who have gone there...
who have uncovered it layer after layer after layer.
they're all observers...
ut not one of them agree conclusively on all points in the field...
because they're perceiving the field mathematically from different angles of perception.
we don't know in quantum mechanics how to hook ourselves as observers up with the world.
we don't know how to treat ourselves as observers...
as just another part of the physical system that we're describing.
the only way we know how to do quantum mechanics as it's traditionally formulated...
is to keep the observer outside of the system you're describing.
uh, the minute you put him in, you get all these paradoxes.
and we're forced to say things in quantum mechanics like...
look, the book is doing what it's doing because of quantum mechanics.
and I see that because I'm there and I see it.
and you'd better not try to analyze that second part of the sentence...
in terms of applying quantum mechanics to it, because it's gonna break down.
that's why there are these two separate laws of the evolutions of physical systems...
one that applies when you're not looking at them...
the other that applies when you are.
but that's crazy.
there's no way that we're ever going to mathematize...
or put into mathematical formula...
this very act in which a conscious observer comes up with the answer.
people say, "Oh, the measuring instruments, the recorder records it."
and there it is. It's on the tape. It's recorded.
you forgot one part of the equation.
somebody has to look at the tape.
and until somebody looks at the tape, it ain't recorded at all.
when you are not looking, they are waves of possibility.
when we are looking, then they're particles of experience.
a particle, which we think of as a solid thing...
really exists in a so-called "superposition." .
a spread-out wave of possible locations...
and it's in all of those at once.
the instant you check on it...
it snaps into just one of those possible positions.
it's easy to generate situations...
where the equations of motion will predict...
that, say, the wave function
the psi of a certain basketball is uniformly distributed all over the basketball court.
we don't have any idea what a state like that would look like.
um, according to the law of quantum mechanics...
that's supposed to be a state in which it fails to make any sense...
even to ask the question, "Where is the basketball?"
that is, according to the law of quantum mechanics...
asking the question, "Where is a basketball...
whose psi is uniformly distributed over a whole basketball court?
is the logical equivalent of asking about, say, the marital status of the number five.
okay? It's not that you don't know the answer
you don't happen to know whether the number five is married or a bachelor
it's that the question somehow is radically inappropriate in the first place.
the number five doesn't have a marital status.
there's nothing there to ask about.
and similarly, a basketball whose wave function was uniformly distributed over the entire basketball court...
would not have a position that could even coherently be asked about.
now, um, the crux of the measurement problem is precisely that...
although the Schrodinger equation predicts under certain circumstances
circumstances which we basically know how to reproduce in the laboratory
that basketballs should go into states like that
states where there fails to be any intelligible fact
um, any- any sensible question even about where they are.
and yet, when we go look- look at the basketball court in situations like that...
we invariably see either a basketball over here...
or a basketball over there，or a basketball over there.
the fact that we see the basketball in some specific location...
as opposed to seeing it in some science fiction state that we can't even imagine what it looks like...
where there fails to be a question about what its location is
the fact that we always see it in some definite location...
is an explicit violation of these equations of motion.
and it's exactly there that the measurement problem comes up.
when you observe, things happen.
when you don't, they don't .
superheroes use superposition...
with the world being potential strips of reality until we choose.
heroes choose what they want being in many places at once, experiencing many possibilities all at once...
and then collapsing on the one.
the question is, how far down the rabbit hole do you wanna go?
your own mind is creating multiple possibilities in your subconscious.
the superpositions of possibilities are in your subconscious.
I mean, you may be consciously aware of them, but they exist, I think...
in superposition of multiple possibilities which after a while will collapse to one or the other.
project or plan into the future，or cast a thought ahead of itself.
nice shot.
but the great, great grandaddy of wacky quantum weirdness...
is entanglement.
if time reversal symmetry destroys the notion of time...
then entanglement crushes our experience of space.
two objects, two electrons created together are entangled.
send one to the other side of the universe.
now, do something to one...
and the other responds instantly.
instantly.
so, either information is traveling infinitely fast...
or in reality, they are still connected.
they are entangled.
and since everything was entangled at the moment of the big bang...
that means everything is still touching.
space is just the construct that gives the illusion that there are separate objects.
are we far enough down the rabbit hole yet?
you now can see in numerous labs around the United States...
objects that are large enough to be seen by the naked eye...
and they are in two places simultaneously.
you can actually take a photograph of that.
now, I suppose if you showed a photograph they'd say, "Oh. Great."
here's this nice blob of colored light, and I see there's...
you know, a bit of it over here and another bit
so you've got a picture of two dots. What's the big deal?
superposition is pre-detection.
what I was speaking about in the film is post-detection.
now, under normal circumstances...
a single object, once it has been detected...
is in just one position.
however, there are states of matter that have been created now...
in which objects can be in multiple positions simultaneously, not just two...
but actually, as many as 3, 000 positions.
uh, the first of these objects were called Bose-Einstein condensates.
and they are single wave functions...
meaning they are single particles...
but even though they're a single wave function...
the wave function has multiple positions.
you say, "Look right in the chamber. You can see it right there."
I see two things there.
no, no. That's not two things
that's one thing. It's the same thing in two places.
the tricky point here is that it's still a single wave function.
it's not 3, 000 separate wave functions.
it's one wave function.
so it's one particle.
I'm not sure that people's jaw would drop about it...
because I think
I don't think people really believe it.
and I don't mean that people say, "Oh, you're lying," or "Oh, the scientists are confused.
I-I think it is so mysterious that you can't even understand how amazing it is.
one particle...
in 3, 000 different locations.
now, if you were to weigh one of them，would it weigh 1 /3, 000th?
well, you can't weigh one of them.
Why?
because it's one particle.
it's just- It's one indivisible particle.
but if it's, uh- But if it's in different locations...
can't you put a scale under one?
no, it's inseparable.
it's not a-This is the tricky conceptual part that you
it's not 3, 000 separate parts.
even though it looks that way?
right.
you can look at it in that- You can't actually see the one with 3, 000.
you can look at the simpler ones that are two or three or four.
and you can see the- You can see
that's to say, if you go on- If you go onto the Web...
you'll see photographs of these.
you'll see these little dots floating in space.
these are the different parts of one object.
it's not- They're not separable, uh．
it's not four different objects, or six different objects.
it's one wave function. It's one object.
that's a real brain fart, isn't it?
cause when you think about it, you just...
wait a minute. No, no, no. They're here, here, here.
so it's obviously one, two, three.
no, and you can't pull one away from the others.
if you try to pull one away from the others...
the entire thing will just disappear.
and then, furthermore, you've seen Star Trek and whatnot.
beam me up, Scotty.
beam me up, Scotty.
so it all seems sort of, "Oh, well, what does that really mean?
but you've gotta really stop and think about what that means
that it's the same object and it's in two places at once.
people tinker in the lab, and they get angry about things, and they have lunch...
and they go home，and they lead their lives...
just as though nothing utterly astounding is happening...
because that's how you have to go about it
and yet, there's this completely amazing magic...
sitting right in front of your eyes.
where the hell are you?
I've got a studio full of people...
but, oh, my God!
there's no photographer.
where, oh, where can she be?
aliens? Loch Ness monster?
or a hot date?
we took two simple black boxes like this.
inside is a very simple electric circuit...
with a few diodes, oscillator, EPROM，some resistors and capacitors.
basically, that's it.
we wrap one in aluminum foil.
we put it in an electrically-grounded Faraday cage.
the other we set on a tabletop around which...
four very well-qualified meditators highly inner-self-managed individuals- sit.
and they go into a deep meditative state.
they cleanse the environment.
they make it essentially a sacred space using their mind- cleansing procedures，and their intentions.
and then one of the four speaks the specific intention for this device.
the intention is to influence a particular target experiment.
uh, might be to increase the pH of purified water by one full pH unit...
or to decrease the pH by one full pH unit.
we have used these devices on all of those experiments...
and have been robustly successful.
in the meditative process then, after one speaks the particular intention...
it's held various ways by the four for maybe 15 minutes.
and then, so be it. It's let go.
and then, a subsidiary intention is stated...
to seal that imprint into the device.
we take one of these devices with its aluminum foil.
we put it in a soft package. We put it in a FedEx packet.
we ship it 2, 000 miles away to the laboratory we were using up in Minnesota.
and as soon as it arrives there, it goes into its own electrically-grounded Faraday cage.
the next day, we do the same with the control.
experiment is running. And basically...
then one just takes the device out...
sets it beside the experiment within six inches to a foot...
and turns it on for a period of time.
that's it.
now, we learned over some period of time that there was another factor.
we found that the use of these we call them intention imprinted electrical devices
the continued use of this...
somehow conditions a space...
to some higher level of symmetry...
and we start getting new phenomena.
that is, the devices work. That is, the pH...
which is normal, starts rising one full pH unit...
if that was the imprint, or starts dropping.
if you go one full pH unit or beyond, you're dead.
I mean, that's what it means to a human.
R. E.G. machines-random event generators- are electronic tosses of the coin.
one type of random number generator experiment...
that's been conducted many, many times hundreds of times over the past four decades or so since around the 1 960s
has been a random generator that only produces sequences of random bits.
zeros and ones. Like flipping coins.
and you would simply ask somebody to press a button.
it would produce 200 bits...
and you would ask them to say, "Well, try to make it produce more one bits than zero bits.
and when you take the entire body of literature...
all of the hundreds of experiments that have been done...
you can ask a single question:
did it matter that people were trying to push it towards ones，or push it towards zeros?
and the overall answer is yes, it does matter.
that somehow, intention is correlated...
with the operation, with the output of these random number generators...
such that if you wish for more ones...
somehow, the generators produce more ones.
so when they talk about- in quantum physics
being a completely arbitrary and random process...
what they're not accounting for is the extraordinary effect...
of human thought, of human intention.
when the O. J . simpson trial was going on...
lots of people are watching television because of the courtroom drama that was unfolding.
and Radin intuited that there must be a lot of intention going on at the time when the courtroom drama is strong
so he hired a bunch of psychologists who kept track of the courtroom drama.
at the same time, uh, Radin was studying the behavior of random number generators.
but then, uh, Radin found that whenever the intentions were strong in the courtroom that's when the deviation of these random number generators from randomness becomes very high.
this leads naturally to wonder, do people
are people affecting the world of reality that they see?
you betcha they are.
every single one of us affects the reality that we see.
even if we try to hide from that and play victim we all are doing it.
just tell me where you are.
okay, good. But hurry, will you, please?
because these models are giving me a headache.
ten minutes.
our subway exhibit comes to us from Japan and Mr. Masaru Emoto.
Mr. Emoto became terribly interested in the molecular structure of water and what affects it.
now, water is the most receptive of the four elements.
Mr. Emoto thought perhaps it would respond to nonphysical events.
so he set up a series of studies
for one sample of water, we drop about 5 c. c.'s onto each 50 petri dishes.
then we take those 50 petri dishes and freeze them in a freezer at minus 25 degrees Celsius for about three hours.
we take those frozen samples into a refrigerator that is set at minus five degrees Celsius where a microscope with a camera is set up.
there, we take photographs of each of the 50 water drops individually.
we first take photographs of water that we did not put any information in.
then, we take the water with information and do the same procedure just described.
we take those before-and-after photographs and compare the differences.
when we projected the feeling of love and thanks to water it made the most beautiful crystal.
at times like this, I think water is at peace.
this first picture is a picture of water from the Fujiwara Dam.
and this picture is the same water after receiving a blessing from a Zen Buddhist monk.
now in this next series of pictures
Mr. Emoto printed out words taped them to bottles of distilled water and left them out overnight.
this first photograph is a picture of the pure, distilled water just the essence of itself.
these subsequent photographs, as you can see, are each different.
this is the "Chi of Love."
and we move along here to "Thank You.
and you can see where he taped that to this bottle here.
but if you read Japanese, you already knew that.
now, Mr. Emoto speaks of the thought or intent, being the driving force in all of this.
the science of how that actually affects the molecules is unknown except to the water molecules, of course.
and it's really fascinating when you keep in mind that 90% of our bodies are water. %
makes you wonder, doesn't it?
if thoughts can do that to water imagine what our thoughts can do to us.
one of the most interesting experiments with random event generators...
occurred when it was really out of time.
some of the Princeton investigators and some of the other ones decided that they would try to see whether or not you could affect a random machine after it had run.
so they converted it- Instead of having a computer with a visual screen they had a computerized situation that was, um, audio tapes.
and they had it with left- clicks in the left ear and clicks in the right ear.
and they already played this with nobody listening to it...
so that it already ran.
they put that in a vault, and they then gave the tape，the already-run tape, to a participant and said "Take it home. I want you to listen to it "and I want you to make more left-ear clicks than right-ear clicks with it.
send your intention to it.
so the person did. They handed back the tape and they played it and, lo and behold
and they played the one in the vault too
and they discovered that they were both the same and they both had more left clicks than right clicks.
so what was going on here?
well, it wasn't as though the person who was the participant had actually affected it at the moment he was listening to it.
his thoughts and his attention had moved back down the timeline and affected it at the moment it was generated.
most people don't affect reality in a consistent, substantial way because they don't believe they can.
whatever way we observe the world around us is what comes back to us.
and the reason why my life, for instance， is so lacking in joy and happiness and fulfillment is because my focus is lacking in those same things exactly.
if we're victims, we should ask ourselves，"Have I a victim mentality?
if I'm continually meeting misfortunes and accidents and tragedies maybe it's because my mentality is basically attuned to accepting that this is the way life is, and so it happens.
now, why can I not achieve those things?
fundamentally, through lack of focus.
the average person loses their attention span every six to 10 seconds per minute.
when one wants to focus intent you want to be a singleness of mind.
that's why some of the old occult teachings, teach people to focus on a flame a match flame, in fact
so that you learn to bring your attention into a very sharp channel so that the energy density becomes greater.
the mind is structured in layers just like the universe is structured in layers from superficial to profound.
and if we use the mind at a very superficial level of ordinary thought we have very limited power.
we can barely move a speck of dust across a tabletop without using our hands.
so weak can consciousness be.
but at the deepest level of consciousness, consciousness creates universes.
but we always wonder then, don't we...
when we wish for all of those
to be able to heal with a touch and to raise the dead and to manifest a loaf of bread in our hand
and we always wonder why we can't do that.
but we can never ask a question that we don't already know the answer to.
and the answer is is because we don't believe we can do it and it interferes with our agenda of our own personal addictions that define us.
we have never had enough time to care for anyone else other than our own emotional addictive needs.
Hey, how was the shoot?
it sucked.
your boss called.
he's worried about you.
Amanda, I want to thank you for letting me stay here.
I know I'm a bit much sometimes and that it's been tough after Bob and all.
and, um... you've just been so wonderful.
I make a mess, and- well, I clean up afterwards, but it's not really your style.
sometimes I think you make me sane.
me？
the day I make someone sane, they're in trouble.
anyway, um...
I made you something as a thank-you gift.
open it.
I went through your pictures and picked my favorite ones.
and it took me forever because there are so many good ones.
this
that's for all the wonderful photos you will be taking.
I've had a strange day.
thank you.
why are we here?
if thoughts can do that to water...
imagine what our thoughts can do to us.
thought about what thoughts are made of
is there a substance of thought?
this is a dream that I'm dreaming.
just as in a dream you dream, different characters can emerge and come out to you and talk to you and meet you it's possible to go to another level of dreaming where you can become each of the characters that you dream.
we can go backward and forward in time.
time is relative.
it goes backwards in time.
and then forward in time.
time was not absolute.
information.
time reversal symmetry.
of course we can go backward and forward in time.
are all realities in the quantum field existing simultaneously
the actual event of experience
there literally are different worlds in which we live.
there's the macroscopic world that we see
there's the world of our cells. There's the world of our atoms.
the world of our nuclei.
these are each totally different worlds.
they have their own language. They have their own mathematics.
they're notjust smaller. Each is totally different but they're complementary.
because I am my atoms, but I am also my cells. I am also my macroscopic physiology. It's all true.
there are just different levels of truth.
the deepest level of truth uncovered by science and by philosophy is the fundamental truth of unity.
at that deepest subnuclear level of our reality you and I are literally one- one- one.
one
this gradually led into some notions that there was an invisible connection between everything.
physicists give this a name. They call it "entanglement."
as Einstein put it, he didn't believe quantum mechanics could be true because it required that there be spooky action at a distance.
that was his term.
what he meant is when we have our ordinary sense of the way that the fabric of reality is it seems like these two places are absolutely in space they're separate and never the twain shall meet.
but in fact, it's not true.
at some deeper level that we can't see with our eyes very clearly...
two places in space are the same.
they are colocated, coexisting.
so, if we imagine that common sense...
the way common sense literally meaning what your senses tell you about the world...
if that's the way the world is actually constructed then things like psychic and mystical experience don't make any sense at all because the whole point about psychic and mystical experience that makes them strange is the sense there's some kind of connection between what's going on inside your head
so what this view of quantum mechanics provides is a way of framing what these strange experiences are like.
and it reframes it from somehow magically information is getting inside my head from signals or forces or something into a different view, which is that in a sense your head, yes, is here but it's also spread out- spread out through space and time.
so when I'm able to get a telepathic impression from somebody at a distance it's not because I somehow jumped out there and got it but because at some deep level my head and the other person's head are colocated.
we become entangled all the time when we communicate telepathically.
those experiences are so striking.
I literally can read your thoughts if I become entangled with you.
and such things happen. There are distant viewing experiments.
there are even experiments now that you are seeing light flashes and your brain potentials picks up the signature of those light flashes what is called "evoke potential..."
that can be measured in an E. E.G. machine connected to your brain.
and I am sitting over there. No light flashes.
I cannot see you.
and, still, my brain potential, because I am correlated with you in terms of intention
I intend to be directly communicated with your experiences.
that intention produces me- gives me the capability of simultaneously having a similar brain potential in my brain.
it was first done by Jacobo Grinberg at the University of Mexico and now repeated by Peter Fenwick in London.
the day should be the sunrise.
it should be the beginning of great thought.
I wake up in the morning and I consciously create my day the way I want it to happen.
now, sometimes, because my mind is examining all the things that I need to get done it takes me a little bit to settle down and get to the point.
but here's the thing. When I create my day and out of nowhere, little things happen that are so unexplainable...
I know that they are the process or the result of my creation.
and the more I do that the more I build a neuronet in my brain that I accept that that's possible gives me the power and the incentive to do it the next day
and we all create our own realities and we do that because we are the observer.
we are each the own observer of our own reality.
and each of our individual consciousnesses creates our own individual reality in the most amazing way.
my son, Evan, the physicist, says it's an additive thing.
if I'm holding one reality and someone else is holding another reality
I mean, it's the Super Bowl this afternoon.
and the reality that the Eagles are holding is a different reality than what the Patriots are holding.
and only one of those realities are gonna be the real reality.
so there's some additive, and there are interference patterns.
I think if we keep quantum physics and the understanding very simple for the layperson that our observation has a direct effect on our world.
I think if we keep it very simple, then people can get about the business of beginning to practice the skill of observation.
see, the subatomic world responds to our observation but the average person loses their attention span every 6 to 10 seconds per minute.
so, that doesn't leave a lot of room for our attention span.
so how can the very large respond to someone who doesn't have the ability to even focus and concentrate?
maybe we're just poor observers.
maybe we haven't mastered the skill of observation and maybe it is a skill.
and maybe we're so addicted to the external world and so addicted to the stimulus and response of the external world that the brain is beginning to work out of response instead of out of creation.
if we're given the proper knowledge and the proper understanding and given the proper instruction we should begin to see measurable feedback in our life.
if you make the effort to sit down and design a new life and you make it the most important thing and you spend time every day feeding it like a gardener feeds a seed you will produce fruit.
we are running the holodeck.
we are collectively. It's there.
it has such flexibility that anything you can imagine, it will create.
and you learn. I mean, your intention causes this thing to materialize once you're conscious enough.
Yes, so what is consciousness?
what is consciousness?
well, consciousness is a very difficult thing to define.
what is consciousness? Where does it come from?
people have been trying to explain consciousness and trying to figure out what exactly it is what it means for us as human beings, why we even have it.
a simple way of defining it is it has to do with awareness, and in particular, awareness of the self.
that's at least how we, as human beings, have self-consciousness so that when we look in a mirror, we recognize that it's ourselves that we're looking at and not some other person or animal.
and do you think science will understand that better than having to handle a hot potato called consciousness that has so much cultish religion backwater voodoo attached to it?
consciousness has been left out of the equations of physics in general, as well as quantum physics for a very simple reason
it's easier to do things that way.
I hate weddings!
a wedding?
come on, Frank!
this is a good assignment, if you'd see it that way.
what's to see?
I do.
they did.
Aw, God, Amanda. I mean, you live in your past.
everything with you is about what happened.
you hate churches you hate weddings, you hate guys.
consciousness. We have great trouble defining it.
to me, consciousness is a by-product of spirit entering dense matter.
but we have a long, long way to grow before we get to the stage where it is meaningful for us to ask the question: Will we know God?
most people think of God as that great figure in the sky with the white beard, who's scrutinizing the human race from above.
they see us here on Earth as in some form of neutral testing ground where we're placed by God for a period and God watches from above registering the scores on his laptop as to whether we perform according to his designs or whether we're "offending him," as it's put.
an absolutely outrageous idea.
how could we offend God the type of God that people believe in?
how could it matter so much to him?
how could it, above all, matter that he would find it so serious a situation that he could condemn us to an eternity of suffering?
these are bizarre ideas.
but, obviously, they have a great hold on the fears and the limitations and the insecurities of people which is why religion can play so effectively whether deliberately or otherwise on those insecurities. People fall into line very readily when they're threatened by these cosmic sentences of everlasting punishment.
how in the Ten Commandments could we have possibly created a mind that could transcend space and time?
no, we're too busy keeping our emotions in check to ever dream of infinite possibilities.
and maybe that is the ultimate conspiracy.
even though a given person may have long ago thrown off the trappings of religion they still live in the religious mold
and they don't even know it but their whole conception of how reality works is all something that has been molded by religion.
so, until you get that out of your system you can't ever make a go of an evolutionary perspective.
one of the problems with organized religions is that there is this sense of separateness that it's only good to be a Protestant or that people who are Catholics are the only people who know the way.
and I think now, our current understanding of quantum physics is this understanding of complete unity.
and so that we have to derive our spirituality from a sense of unity.
this is the basic journey of spirituality when we ask the question, "Why am I feeling separate all the time?
speaking of God always conjures up the idea of the old guy with the white beard in the cloud judging, observing, punishing, rewarding or giving commands.
once you're on that track you are totally off the path of spiritual evolution and development.
the great appeal of all to people who don't want to grow up but want the great parent in the skies looking after them is to ask Jesus to do it for me.
if only I place my trust in Jesus he will save me from my sins and look after me and all will be well.
well, Jesus cannot eat my lunch for me and Jesus cannot be born for me. And neither can Jesus save me.
because what we're talking about in this- in real terms is not being saved by anyone
God or otherwise.
we are talking about a personal evolution.
the only reason that there is an addiction to religion is some way out of a mistake.
does that diminish the greatness of God?
no. It actually opens the corral，and lets God be eternal absolute.
the law that is given to us is the same law as given to that of those people on Sirius.
given to us by the people in the Rose Universe or the "R" Universe.
you know, and your Hubble telescope has finally seen galaxies of immeasurable beauty that in our heart and in our mind we long to engage.
it's exciting to meet beings of greater mind or lesser mind.
and where does it end? It doesn't end.
it doesn't end.
we do not want to accept responsibility.
we do not want to accept our greatness.
so it's very easy for any system of thought religious or otherwise, that comes along
it's very easy to play on that, to play on our insecurities to assure us all is well, we'll all be taken care of.
we lap that up.
so don't blame religion.
blame our own insecurities which has allowed religion to flourish and which has allowed so many systems of thought that are disempowering to flourish throughout human history.
that's why we can't get out of it.
I now present to you
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Buck Filipowski.
experiencing something in the present day that is a trigger to something that is very emotionally charged for us.
so, now, we have become even more disconnected from the reality of what actually is.
the new dream like a thunderstorm in our brain and its electrical strikes through our synaptic skies...
to the earth of our being...
creates a chemical cascade in our body...
that prepares our body...
for conquest, achievement...
a relishing experience emotionally.
but we would have no conquest...
indeed, we would have no "relishment..."
if we had not first had that hologram...
and those chemicals that made us...
or rather, changed us...
from being fearful entities...
into fearless entities after a dream.
the frontal lobe is the crowning achievement of the human brain.
the frontal lobe.
this frontal lobe...
allows us a "distinguishness" to change our minds.
through the workings of the nervous system...
and the particular way that it implements quantum effects
very distinct, specific way...
not general, not fuzzy, not imprecise
that it absolutely does open the door for free will being a possibility that does not violate modern scientific tenets.
and that's consistent, uh, to a certain extent with people's subjective impression that we do have free will.
what separates us from all other species is the ratio of our frontal lobe to the rest of the brain.
the frontal lobe is an area of the brain that's responsible for firm intention for decision making, for regulating behavior, for inspiration.
it is the seat of what causes us to take information from our environment and process it and store it in our brain to make decisions or choices that are different than the decisions and choices that we've made in the past.
the brain is made up of tiny nerve cells called neurons.
these neurons have tiny branches that reach out and connect to other neurons to form a neuronet.
each place where they connect is integrated into a thought or a memory.
now, the brain builds up all its concepts by the law of associative memory.
for example, ideas, thoughts and feelings are all constructed and interconnected in this neuronet and all have a possible relationship with one another.
the concept and the feeling of love, for instance is stored in this vast neuronet.
but we build the concept of love from many other different ideas.
some people have love connected to disappointment.
when they think about love they experience the memory of pain， sorrow, anger, and even rage.
rage may be linked to hurt which may be linked to a specific person which then is connected back to love.
every observation can be looked upon as a quantum measurement.
this quantum measurement produces memory.
we always perceive something after reflection in the mirror of memory.
it is this reflection in the mirror of memory...
that gives us that sense of "I-ness" - who I am.
the brain does not know the difference between what it sees in its environment and what it remembers because the same specific neuronets are then firing.
we know physiologically that nerve cells that fire together wire together.
if you practice something over and over again...
those nerve cells have a long-term relationship.
if you get angry on a daily basis if you get frustrated on a daily basis if you suffer on a daily basis if you give reasons for the victimization in your life you're rewiring and reintegrating that neuronet on a daily basis and that neuronet now has a long-term relationship with all those other nerve cells called an identity.
we also know that nerve cells that don't fire together no longer wire together.
they lose their long-term relationship...
because every time we interrupt the thought process...
that produces a chemical response in the body, every time we interrupt it...
those nerve cells that are connected to each other...
start breaking the long-term relationship.
if we practice our mental rehearsal and our skill in being able to do it will show that certain brain circuits will grow as a result of our effort.
it'll get easier to do, in other words.
if we accept that idea then it will allow us to go back the next day and do it with more certainty and with more acceptance.
that in itself...
is no different than praying.
you see, there's no religious text that says thought doesn't matter.
there's no religious text that doesn't say your prayer and your intention shouldn't be answered by God.
but explaining how that happens...
is what quantum physics and the observer is all about.
but still when we can make thought more real than anything else
our brain is designed to do that.
the frontal lobe, with its enormous space...
is the altar in which we place a thought...
and it gives us the permission...
to hold a thought for an extended period of time...
and it lowers the volume to external stimuli.
we lose track of time and space.
that's the moment we're stepping into the quantum field.
that's the moment that now we're making thought more real than anything else.
we are physically, chemically emotional human beings.
that's not a bad thing.
it only becomes a limitation when we keep accessing...
those same emotions and those same attitudes on a daily basis...
and go nowhere in terms of our change or evolution in our life.
how can we say that we have lived fully every day by simply experiencing the same emotions that we're addicted to every day?
what we're actually saying is "I have to reconfirm who I am
and my personality is, "I have to do this. I have to go here. I have to be that.
a master is quite a different cat.
it is one that sees the day as an opportunity in time...
to create avenues of reality...
and emotions that are unborn of realities that are unborn...
that the day becomes a fertilization of infinite tomorrows.
there's a part of the brain called the hypothalamus...
and the hypothalamus is like a little mini factory.
and it is a place that assembles certain chemicals that matches certain emotions that we experience.
those particular chemicals are called peptides.
they're small chain amino acid sequences.
the body's basically a carbon unit that makes about 20 different amino acids all togather to formulate its physical structure.
in the hypothalamus, we take small chain proteins called peptides...
and we assemble them into certain neuropeptides or neurohormones...
that match the emotional states that we experience on a daily basis.
so there's chemicals for anger, and there's chemicals for sadness...
and there's chemicals for victimization.
there's chemicals for lust.
there's a chemical that matches every emotional state that we experience.
and the moment that we experience that emotional state.
in our body or in our brain...
that hypothalamus will immediately assemble the peptide.
it then releases it through the pituitary into the bloodstream.
the moment it makes it into the bloodstream...
it finds its way to different centers or different parts of the body.
every single cell in the body has these receptors on the outside.
one cell can have thousands of receptors...
studding its surface, kind of opening up to the outside world.
and when a peptide docks on a cell...
it literally- like a key going into a lock
sits on the receptor surface and attaches to it...
and kind of moves the receptor and...
kind of like a doorbell buzzing, sends a signal into the cell.
it's party time!
what happens in adulthood is that...
most of us who've had our glitches along the way...
are operating in a emotionally detached place...
or we're operating as if today were yesterday.
what is it?
mixed.
change in itself means, then...
that we have to abandon our old self.
it means that we have to leave behind our identity for a few moments...
and begin to speculate who we could be.
to change means modifying our behavior enough...
so that it's permanent.
our experiences is color what we know.
so there is no completely objective appraisal of anything.
because our appraisal of everything...
has to do with our previous experiences...
and our emotions.
everything has an emotional weighting to it.
we've gone from emotions being these spiritual immaterial things to things
they're not even things
to actual molecules with molecular weights...
and peptides with sequences and structures.
science knows now that the hypothalamus makes neuropeptides...
and those neuropeptides are strong chemicals.
well, here's the story of the peptide and the cell.
the peptides find the receptors...
and dock onto them and stay attached.
then they come off, and then they can come back on again.
and while they're there, they are changing the cell.
a receptor that has a peptide sitting in it...
sets off a whole cascade of biochemical events...
some of which changes nucleus of the cell.
each cell is definitely alive...
and, uh, each cell has a consciousness...
particularly if we define consciousness as the point of view of an observer.
there is always the perspective of the cell.
the cell knows where it is. The cell knows where it's going.
the cell knows what proteins it's making.
the cell knows whether it's about to divide or whether it's in a program to stop dividing.
in fact, the cell is the smallest unit of consciousness in the body.
I'm hungry!
the cells are yelling up to the brain, saying...
hungry! - "We haven't gotten our fix today."
and it's gonna start sending impressions to the brain. - [ Cell ] Hey!
I'm hungry. - And the brain is gonna start to formulate imagery.
it's gonna sound like voices in our head.
I'm hungry! - To think of a reason why we should be depressed.
Yes, I'm hungry! - Think of a reason why we should be confused.
think of a reason for our own suffering.
and the body's gonna be telling the brain...
that it's not getting its chemical need
chemical needs met.
and so the brain will then activate...
and start going to our past situations...
Yeah. - and flashing pictures to our frontal lobe.
Oh, yeah! We've commandeered an entire serving platter!
Yeah, keep it comin'! Keep it comin'!
delicious! - Oh, yeah!
well, my definition of an addiction is something really simple.
something that you can't stop.
we bring to ourselves situations that will fulfill...
the biochemical craving of the cells of our body...
by creating situations that meet our chemical needs.
it always happens to me!
every day! - Why me?
so my definition really means that...
if you can't control your emotional state, you must be addicted to it.
Oh, this ruins everything!
the people that we really love...
are people who are willing to share our emotional needs...
our feelings, whatever they are.
whether they're sexual. - [ Whooping ]
whether they are victimized- "Poor me. Poor you. " - Why me?
whether they are power. You need somebody to control you. - Fun, fun, fun.
so you feel like you're in control.
don't dip your half-eaten shrimp back into the cocktail sauce.
screw you and your health codes! I am the bride's sister!
I'll stick my ass in the cocktail sauce if I damn well please!
I want you to get out there and serve. Make sure everybody has a full plate. Fun, fun, fun.
if you won't do anything about it
me show you with you want!
what is reality?
what is reality? - What is reality?
how do we know that it's reality? - What is real reality?
they have taken laboratory animals...
and they've hooked up electrodes in certain parts of their brain that produce those neuropeptides.
and those neuropeptides are such strong chemicals...
that, given the fact that they train the laboratory animal...
to press a lever to get that chemical release
that neuropeptide release
it would choose the neuropeptide release...
more than hunger, more than sex...
more than thirst, more than sleep.
as a matter of fact, it went to the point of physical exhaustion...
and collapsed before it would take care of itself physically.
and that's really what stress does to our body.
we become so addicted to the stress in our lives...
that we can't quit our job, even though it doesn't serve us.
we can't leave our relationship because it doesn't serve us.
we can't make choices, because the stimulus and responses...
produce the chemistry that clouds our choices.
and we're no different than the dog who lacks its ability to make choices because of its smaller frontal lobe.
so how can anyone really say they're in love with a specific person, for example?
they're only in love with the anticipation of the emotions they're addicted to.
because the same person could fall out of favor the next week by not complying.
Oh, Josh!
Oh! - Amanda!
how can you not freakin' see?
no. No, no, no, no. You got the punch line wrong.
it's a- It's a photographer's joke.
go on about your, uh- Uh, music.
are you-Are you okay?
well, I
I saw that groom humping some girl.
uh, when?
just now!
I was with the, uh- the groom
Hey, I can read lips!
I'm sorry.
uh, I was with the groom just now.
he loves Paulette.
where?
Polacks-They all look the same in a tux.
everybody secretly is an adventurer.
everybody loves the adventure.
it's just taking that first step.
and once they have the moment of insight...
that moment of insight carries frequency.
it carries a message.
the cells of the body are enlivened by possibility.
they're enlivened by unknown potentials.
they're enlivened by a future history or future opportunity...
that may be down the rabbit hole a little further.
and if they allow themselves to experience the quandary...
and the mysticism and the possibility...
that when they emerge from the rabbit hole, they're a different person.
and now they go back into their world.
and because they've processed that information...
and left footprints in the mind and in the brain...
their perception of the world will never be the same.
how can we say that we have lived fully every day...
by simply experiencing the same emotions that we're addicted to every day?
a master is quite a different cat.
another drink?
it is one that sees the day as an opportunity in time...
to create avenues of reality...
and emotions that are unborn...
that the day become infinite tomorrows.
to the groom! - To the groom!
Whoo!
what's up, guys? - 'Sup, man?
hello. - What do we need?
some foxes. - Who put out!
Yeah, baby!
Yes, it's a psychosomatic network, and, yes, some of us
you know, particularly adolescent boys
are under the control of lower... centers.
more drinks. More drinks.
the eye isn't in control of the molecules of emotion.
it's more, um- I don't want to say at the mercy of it.
but these rapid eye movements that help us decide where to focus...
are mediated in the midbrain...
and you can map opiate receptors there...
and receptors for many of the other peptides.
so once again the relevant search command that's going on...
is related to finding a certain emotional state.
Oh. Oh, gosh. She wouldn't fall for me. No.
Oh, mama!
Whoo! What the hell are you waitin' for?
come on, you little pussies!
Geez! I can't believe you guys!
what are you- Ooh, come on. Come over here.
just get the hell outta the way.
hi there, honey. Come on, baby.
you know you want it.
Oh, don't give me that look.
what about people who are addicted to sex?
actually, sex itself is an invention to allow us to see into the future.
think about that for a while.
Whoa! Whoo!
hello there, big boy.
Oh, mama!
is that a rocket in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?
I wanna hear some polka music, okay? - I'm gonna play the polka music.
these people here want have some polka music.
you can't have a Polish wedding without polka music!
No! Would you leave it alone! Keep your- [ Bleep ] hands off!
how can you have a Polish wedding without any- [ Bleep ] Polish music?
keep your- [ Bleep ] hands off my equipment!
it ain't a Polish wedding without a polka!
our mind literally creates our body.
but it all starts in the cell.
and who gives the cells the order?
the orders come from the neuronet in our brain...
which are based on the experiences and information that we've logged in there.
e use a certain box of solutions to our life...
that causes chemistry to take place.
so in order for us to change the chemistry...
we would literally have to change the neuronet...
which means we'd have to change our identity...
which means we'd have to change our attitude...
or change the way in which we interact with our environment.
and every time we keep being the same person...
and keep experiencing the same attitudes...
all we're doing is reinforcing ourselves as our identity.
I once did a little gig in a women's prison.
they were all heroin addicts.
and by teaching them that they have receptors for the heroin...
and that the more heroin that they take...
their ability to make their own internal endorphins...
their own internal heroin basically starts to decline...
and the receptors start to become sub-sensitive...
or there's actually less of them.
so there's these actual changes.
then this new information about how less brain cells are being made...
so that people get kind of
in all addictions they get stuck in old patterns.
the person's mental life...
becomes dominated by pain...
such that everything that they perceive is colored by the pain.
and sometimes, every way that they react and everything that they do...
becomes all about their pain.
one of the things about receptors is, they change in their sensitivity.
if a given receptor for a given drug or internal juice...
is being bombarded for a long time at a high intensity...
it will literally shrink up.
there will be less of them, or it will be hooked up in such a way that it is desensitized or down-regulated.
so the same amount of drug or internal juice...
will elicit a much smaller response.
No! No!
if we're bombarding the cell with the same attitude...
and the same chemistry over and over again on a daily basis...
when that cell finally decides to divide...
when it produces a sister cell or a daughter cell...
that next cell will have more receptor sites...
for those particular emotional neuropeptides...
and less receptor sites for vitamins, minerals, nutrients, fluid exchange...
or even the release of waste products or toxins.
now, all aging is the result of improper protein production.
what happens when we age?
our skin gets - loses elasticity.
well, elastin is a protein.
what happens to our enzymes? We don't digest as well.
what happens to our synovial fluid?
those are proteins that become brittle and stiff.
what happens to our bones? They become thin.
so all aging is the result of improper protein production.
so the question arises- Does it really matter what we eat?
and does nutrition really have an effect...
if the cell doesn't even have the receptor sites...
after 20 years of emotional abuse...
to even receive or to let in the nutrients...
that are necessary for its health?
if we know the thoughts of a person...
we will best know them by their addiction...
their continuous, over 24 hours in a continuum...
of what emotions they display in their body...
we shall know their thoughts.
I hate you.
we never, ever reincarnate to the "I love you so much" people.
we always reincarnate...
to the situations of why we hate ourself.
I hate you!
you idiot!
you suck!
look at you! You're ugly!
you are worth nothing!
you're getting old!
I hate you!
it makes you wonder, doesn't it?
if thoughts can do that to water...
imagine what our thoughts can do to us.
no one has ever came along...
and ever given you sufficient, intelligent knowledge...
about your beautiful self
how you work from the inside out.
why do you have addictions? Because you have nothing better.
you have dreamt of nothing better...
because no one has ever taught you how to dream better.
there is data now that when people are addicted to...
whether it's cocaine, heroin...
nicotine, alcohol, um...
all of them seem to share a property of blocking the growth of new brain cells.
and yet it can completely come back when the drug-taking has stopped.
if you don't see the traps
you have to go through the crap until you see the traps.
because if you don't see it- It's your only teaching machine.
it's your only way for you to come to understand something new.
so...
the universe brings these things to your door...
and there is learning in them for you...
if you are willing to reflect upon them...
and think beyond the rigid mind-set.
can I
Wow.
uh, borrow some toothpaste?
Thanks!
when I talk about "we" disappearing...
I don't mean that we physically disappear.
what I mean is that we move out of the area of the brain that has to do with our personality...
that has to do with our association to people, our association of places...
our association to things and times and events.
we don't exist in the associative centers in our brain...
that reaffirms our identity and reaffirms our personality.
we now have science to back up what our thoughts do...
and how they make our bodies weak.
a lot of the scientists who are actually studying this with behavioral kinesiology and other ways...
showing that thoughts make your body weak.
and thoughts pretty much create your reality.
they create what you're going to think about yourself.
if you're fat but you think you're wonderful, you'll be wonderful.
but most women are-We're compared all the time with impossible images...
from Barbie to models...
and so we think that our whole currency is how we look...
and how other people are gonna perceive us.
we're always up against impossible standards.
what is relative to their own emotional addiction...
are movies and dramas and news and all the media...
that is so beautiful today...
in providing people with experiences without having to be there.
and yet
and yet...
that does not define human greatness.
they're so hypnotized by their environment...
through the media，through television...
through people living and creating ideals...
that everybody struggles to become that no one can actually become...
in terms of physical appearance...
and definitions of beauty and valor...
that are all illusions...
that most people surrender and live their life in "mediocracy.
and they may live that life and the soul may never really
their desire may never really rise to the surface.
so they may want to be something else.
but if it does rise to the surface and they ask themselves if there is something more...
or why am I here, what is the purpose of life...
where am I going, what happens when I die...
and they start to ask those questions...
they start to flirt and interact with the perception that they may be having a nervous breakdown.
in reality, what they're doing is...
their old concepts of how they viewed their life and the world start to fall apart.
that's why very few people make this journey
because it's deeply unsettling.
all of the molds that we have lived by have to be broken...
and we have to liberate ourselves in this way.
and sometimes there's an awkward period...
between the comfort that we knew before...
and the real state of comfort when we are the lord of our being...
which follows that interval of chaos.
most people, when they get into the chaos, give up hope...
and go back to the old, false securities.
they get to live a reasonable life...
and they get to die in some sort of peace...
but they haven't advanced spiritually at all in that experiment that we call the life.
we're in completely new territory in our brain...
and because we're in completely new territory...
we're rewiring the brain...
literally reconnecting to a new concept.
then, ultimately, it changes us from the inside out.
if I change my mind, will I change my choices?
if I change my choices, will my life change?
why can't I change? What am I addicted to?
what will I lose that I'm chemically attached to?
and what person, place, thing, time or event that I'm chemically attached to...
that I don't want to lose...
because I may have to experience the chemical withdrawal from that.
hence, the human drama.
this life is but a page in an enormous book...
in which we will always be who we are.
but always...
with the inherent...
needling...
of ambitious pursuit...
a pursuit that takes us...
from the boring tedium of self-reflection, of self-hate...
and to self-creation of new dreams.
and we are ambitious gods.
it's the only planet in the Milky Way that has habitation that is steeped in enomous subjugation of religion.
you know why that is?
it's because people have set up right and wrong.
I did say there is no right and wrong.
does that mean that it's a free-for-all?
absolutely not.
the problem that I have with right and wrong and those categories...
is not that I want a free-for-all...
but that right and wrong doesn't go nearly far enough.
they have never sinned.
they have never wrong - Wronged, yes.
immoral confrontations with society.
but that's their adversity. That's why they're here.
to wrong, to learn, to search.
and use the wisdom of that to create yet greater dreams.
there is nobody keeping records there and the recods are here and I'm going to have to deal with them.
that's far more painful than a record-keeping God up in the skies.
so, anyone who's setting out on the path of enlightenment...
will be absolutely impeccable in everything that they do.
is it because of fear of damnation? No.
or of the punishment of God?
or because I have sinned and haven't got forgiveness?
no, no, no. I mean, these are all excuses that keeps us away from the real problem.
the really enlightened person...
will see every action has a reaction with which I must deal.
and if I'm wise, I'm not going to do stuff that will cause me to have to face it and resolve it and balance it in my soul later,
that's the real criterion.
that God, or the fundamental level of reality, depending on what people describe...
really- I mean, theoretically, should be everywhere.
uh, it's something- Exactly how it would manifest...
or how God would manifest in the world...
uh, is a more complicated issue, but, uh...
I think that certainly from a more traditional religious perspective...
people have kind of gotten away from God the person.
there's been a great shift from God up there, or out there, or in there- wherever to the God within.
and that's an improvement...
but we don't want to get some idea that- that
that God can be within and still be separate...
which is what most people think.
they think the God within is like some of those Alien movies...
you know, where some being breaks out from my chest.
God's not within in that, uh, stupid sense.
what it means is, uh, that in God we live, move and have our being
that we ourselves, in fact, are divine.
what's the relationship between my god self and your god self?
there is no relationship because it's only one god self.
it's in both of us.
all people are divine people.
is it not ironic...
that all would say that this is the voice of the devil?
or that this is heresy?
if this is heresy...
then what is promised to everyone...
is an "imbuedment" with God that is inseparable.
knowledge allows the brain to begin to become wired.
and we will begin to see what has always existed.
but because we live in those routine, automatic programs...
we're unable to see, because we're processing mind from the familiar.
to learn knowledge means we're learning new things.
and to learn new things means we're gathering information...
and creating the circuitry now to begin to develop the sensitivity...
to begin to see things for the first time.
there's enormous potential to change the kind of behaviors and characteristic patterns that we've fallen into.
in fact, if you've listened...
and have remembered anything that I've said...
your physiology is different than it was before that.
that is something that Eric Kandel...
the recent winner of the Nobel Prize in medicine and science...
said very eloquently at a talk...
that basically memory has been encoded...
your genetic structure has changed.
and while we previously would talk about the nervous system as this very rigid thing that didn't have much capacity for change...
we now know that on many levels, that isn't true.
and actually, there's a tremendous amount of plasticity...
which basically means ability to change within the nervous system.
and if you look at the structure of the human brain in detail...
you see that it's actually specifically designed, it's carefully engineered...
to experience the unified field, to experience the unity of life.
we are all connected.
I mean, I think the most fundamental thing...
is we're all connected by an energy field.
we swim in a sea of light basically, which is the zero-point field.
and I say, first of all, you have to get
you get away from the whole idea of separateness.
because separateness is the biggest problem of the world now.
you take this notion of an entangled universe...
and you apply it to human experience...
because human experience is part of the universe as well.
and then you say, "Well, let's assume that experience is entangled.
then how would it manifest"?
and we can start going through ways in which it could manifest.
if there's a connection with another mind, we call it telepathy.
if there's a connection to some other object somewhere else, we'd call it clairvoyance.
if there's a connection that happens to transcend time, we'd call it precognition.
if there's a connection in which my intention is expressed out in the world some way...
we might call it psychokinesis, or distant healing or something of that sort.
so you can go through a list of perhaps 1 2 kinds of psychic experience...
that have gotten labels over the years, like telepathy.
but this is really just the tip of the iceberg.
people ask, "Why are you so interested in the Planck scale
the very ultimately tiny in terms of spirituality?
because obviously spirituality is out there. It's everywhere.
and the answer is that, yes, the Planck scale is the ultimately small...
but it's also everywhere.
wherever you go, there it is.
and because it's holographic, it repeats at different scales...
like fractals throughout the universe.
I would say that what quantum physics is to the 20th century...
whatever is going to be the new... bridging of science and spirituality...
that will be to the 21st century.
we are all creating the future.
we are all creating what is outside of us.
none of us are innocent in that regard.
if there's something out there we don't like...
we can't really turn our backs on it...
because we're co-creators somehow or other.
and we have to do the right things...
to try to get the future that is best for all of us.
we have talked so far about the freedom of our own personal life and quantum physics.
that we are freeing and freeing and freeing our reality to ultimate realities.
Yes, of course they exist.
but after we have accomplished them, what then? What next?
when do we make the shift from me to one?
when are we the subconscious mind?
when are we the knowledge of the one, transpersonal self
when you start to realize what your true nature is...
there is no question and there is no answer anymore.
and there's just sudden realization.
now you come back from the rabbit hole...
and you start to perform in this world of illusion and wonder and magic...
with that understanding that you're never gonna die, and you were never born.
choice by consciousness out of these possible events...
the actual event of experience comes in.
and so, for the first time, science encounters free will.
consciousness is free, because there is no mathematical description of the subject...
only objects can be described mathematically...
and only to the extent that they are possibilities.
the question still remains paramount: Who is the chooser?
are all realities existing simultaneously?
is there a possibility that all potentials exist side by side?
welcome to Flatland...
a world of only two dimensions.
only forwards and backwards, left and right.
in this world, there is no up and no down.
and I said to Ray, "Where's Dotty?
he said, "Well, she's out in Line." And I said, "Well"
Where's that from? What the bleep is that thing?
in this world, the two-dimensional beings that live here...
have no concept of three-dimensional objects.
these two-dimensional Flatlanders...
have no understanding of cubes spheres, tetrahedrons...
or yours truly.
from their 2-D perspective...
my 3-D finger looks something like this.
Oh, my gosh.
what in the flat earth is that? - Did you see that?
run!
Hello, little circle. - [ Screams ]
fear of the unknown...
or should I say, not yet known?
it's a puzzle.
if we see only what we know...
how does anyone ever see anything new, the unknown?
how do we ever get out of our box?
Hello, little circle.
don't be afraid.
who said that? Where are you?
this is always the tricky part to explain.
I'm in another dimension, another space.
I am above you. - [ Screams ]
no, never, never use that word.
what word? - The "A" word.
above?
it's forbidden.
well, what do you think it means?
I don't know, and I don't want to know.
you can be severely punished if you use that word.
are you a ghost?
I hope not.
I just have a different perspective than you do.
I can see things in a way you can't yet.
Oh, yeah? Like what?
well, okay.
you have a safe hidden in your pantry.
and inside it you have 1 2 coins, a will and a passport.
how did you know that? What are you?
are you a god?
well, no more than you.
you see, since I am above you... - [ Shrieks ]
in the third dimension...
I can see inside things in your world.
third dimension? You are a crazy ghost.
there's only two. Look.
so, if I were to touch the inside of your stomach...
how would I do that?
well, you'd have to cut through my skin.
otherwise, it's impossible.
stop, stop.
ready for more?
more what? - Dimensions.
Oh. - Directions.
uh, no, yes, but
but there aren't any...
more? [ Echoing ]
what will happen to me? What will I become?
you'd have to become it to know.
okay. - Excellent.
I never knew.
isn't it funny?
that which we are most afraid of is what thrills us the most.
great job, you guys.
has anyone seen Stacy?
Stacy? Stacy, where are you guys?
Oh, hey boss. Table four. Come meet us.
Hey, did you check out that cute guy by the Monet?
the one breathing on the Monet?
I called security.
I think it's best to steer clear of him, given my track record.
Ooh, is that for me?
no, no, that's my... - Thanks! I'm starving!
the show is going great. To Beth!
our fearless leader. - Job well done.
thank you, guys.
Oh, my God. Is that Brady Sacks?
Beth's ex? Where?
not a funny joke. And I'll tell you why.
because if Brady had the nerve to show up here,
I mean at my event, no less, after he...
dumped you like yesterday's trash? - Ripped your heart out and fed it to the Central Park pigeons?
come on, I'm not even over your breakup yet.
well, I am, Ok? In a big way. Brady Sacks?
who cares? That's what I say.
he's right behind me, isn't he?
Brady... - Oh, yeah...
great show. - Great show, guys.
I hate this.
uh, what are you doing here?
look, I know you're crazy busy, but there's something I need to say to you.
something I think'll make up for what I put you through.
uh... Ok.
I've got three words for you, Beth Martin.
I was wrong. - Did he just say he was wrong?
a year ago, when I broke up with you, I felt like you cared more about your work than you did about me.
Yeah, I remember, Brady, really clearly, when you broke up with me in the Applebee's.
I'm sorry about that, but I'm here to tell you that...
I get it. - Can you hear?
barely. I think he said he gets it.
Oh, he gets it!
I'm ready to jump in again, in a big way.
you want to jump in again?
Yeah.
wow, uh...
Yeah. I mean, maybe. If it's slow.
you made me realize that it doesn't matter how hard someone works, as long as you love them enough.
Yes. I can't believe that you're saying that.
I'm just a little overwhelmed.
I met someone who works just as hard as you do, only now I can accept her for that.
we're getting engaged! - Beth's getting engaged!
did I just hear that right?
our host and curator, Beth Martin, is getting engaged?
uh... Uh...
no, I'm not. I'm not getting engaged!
not tonight, not to him.
Oh, man.
but maybe. Maybe in the future sometime.
I don't know. With someone else.
got to see how it pans out. Ok?
well, at least it wasn't in the Applebee's.
worst day ever.
Joan? - Sis! Guess what?
I'm getting married!
Yay.
his name is Umberto. Umberto! How sexy is that?
we met on a flight to Italy two weeks ago, and now we're getting married. In Rome.
Wow. That... Joan. Wow.
he's the one, Beth. I know it. I can't wait until you meet him.
and when I do, I will have known him for almost as long as you have.
you know what? You're not exactly a role model when it comes to relationships.
OK, maybe not, but that is because I have a relationship with my job.
I love my job. And when I find a guy that I like more than my job, that's how I'll know he's the one.
OK, so basically what you need is a male version of yourself.
well, he doesn't have to be blonde.
you know that I mean this with all the love in the world, but two weeks, Joan?
that's not long enough.
that's not even enough time for a credit check.
when you know, you don't need proof. You just know.
be happy for me, B. - God, I am! I am.
I am.
she's doomed. I mean, come on, you meet some Italian guy in first class, you date him.
you don't marry him. - She's so lucky.
just imagine working in a place where they sort men into classes.
what? I'm just saying.
my baby sister is about to make the biggest mistake of her life, and there's nothing I can do about it.
she got swept away. It happens.
no, it doesn't.
instead of chasing a fairy tale, you could focus on work. That's what I do.
and you know what? I've never been happier.
well, you must be ecstatic.
and still single, I understand.
it appears we can begin. In nine days, we'll be hosting the single most important event of our year,
the Board of Trustees' Annual Circle of Gold Gala.
this year, the special installation for the event is the brainchild of our youngest and therefore least-experienced curator.
an exhibition centered on the theme of pain. Status report.
fourteen of our pieces are already on site, and three of the remaining four are on route.
and the remaining piece? - Is the Slater Bradley?
Yes, the centerpiece for the exhibition, where is it?
we're resolving some last-minute insurance issues.
Last-minute? I can't say I like the sound of that.
it'll be here. I'll make sure of it.
moving on...
Ah, there is one small little detail.
the day after tomorrow, my sister will be getting married.
in Rome. Italy.
well, that simply won't do.
well, it's my baby sister's wedding.
well, we all have sisters, Beth.
Mmm.
I will stay on top of this from Rome.
I'll be in and out in 48 hours, and you have my word, Celeste.
the Circle of Gold Gala will go off without a hitch.
it better. You may be talented, Beth, but you're not irreplaceable.
have a nice trip.
so...
how long you stay Rome, eh?
uh, 48 hours and counting.
is not so much time. But lucky for you, it only takes a moment to see true beauty.
the Eternal City is the most romantic city in the world.
you never lived until you loved in Rome.
not a lot of reception around here, huh?
put down your phone and look, signora. Welcome to Roma!
did I mention I'm late for my sister's wedding?
many times. So much beauty!
and, finally, the magnificent Fontana d'Amore.
a place where romantics from all over the world come to wish for love.
old people, young people, ugly people.
they get so lost in love. It's nice!
Yes, nice, thank you.
and good luck!
Joan, the Amsale dress looks gorgeous.
Hi! Hi. - Beth, darling!
wow, look at you. You look exhausted.
Thanks, Mom. - She looks fine.
you look beautiful. - Thank you.
what happened to "don't see the bride before the wedding"?
isn't this bad luck? - Girls, we don't have time.
your father's current tramp of the month is waiting inside with your dress.
I heard that. And she's not a tramp.
she's a pro beach volleyball player. Hello, sweetheart.
Hi, Daddy.
how are you? - Exhausted.
Beth, this is Umberto, my fiance.
so, you're my sister too, now.
Yeah. - Come on.
you have to meet his family. They're a scream.
see if he has a brother.
dad! - Cousin.
slippery little... Come on.
how does he get service?
you're late, Nick. - I'm sorry.
Where's your tie? - Oh!
there we go.
I know, but I can't get an Internet signal.
I need to know that you're on top of the Slater Bradley situation.
Hey!
you're breaking up. Just whistle if you can hear me.
Stacy? - Ah, there's my girl.
taking care of business.
always. - Having a good time?
Oh, yeah. You know me, I love small, intimate weddings.
if you're gonna be a bear, be a grizzly, right?
I don't know what that means.
so, what do you think of Tina? - She seems very fit, Dad.
that's all you can say?
tan and odds-on favorite to catch the bouquet.
you're a very lucky man.
I only wish for you the feeling I have when I'm with her.
come on, Beth. Get going here. I want to throw another wedding.
you will. You're due for another wife pretty soon.
I'm sorry, that was a low blow.
quite a pair, huh?
you refuse to fall in love, and I can't stop.
promise me one thing.
when it comes, you'll be open to it.
I will try, Daddy. - There you are!
it's vase-breaking time. - It's what?
it's a tradition. The maid of honor shatters a vase, and the number of pieces symbolizes the years of happiness she wishes for the bride and groom.
Wow! That's a lot of pressure.
right? So smash it hard.
OK. - Ok.
I'm so sorry.
I was not aiming for that, but, man, I really nailed it.
she wishes them a life - of great tragedy! - No, I don't. No, I don't.
I just... I'm trying to break it. I'm really trying.
I cracked it!
OK. We're almost there. Excuse me.
die! Oh, man!
let's just go ahead and let me handle this.
Wow. You are... you're...
you're quite the determined little thing, aren't you?
Yeah, well, I cracked it before you smashed it.
I know. Yeah, I know.
I'm Nick, by the way. - Beth.
nice to meet you. I would've introduced myself earlier, but I was running a little late.
Yeah, I noticed.
I was in the hills doing an interview, and on my way back I kinda got hit by a goat.
Oh, my God! You hit a goat? - No, the goat hit me.
it wasn't my fault, and the goat's fine.
what are they saying? - It means "speech."
I think you're up again. There you go.
hello again.
I'm Beth, sister of the bride.
umm...
Umberto, though I haven't known you for very long...
uh...
I'm sorry. I don't speak any Italian.
Umberto, although I haven't known you very long...
I'm a little rusty, so if you stay away from any obscure idioms, that would be great.
Yeah. Sure. I'll keep it simple. - Thank you.
when I look at you, Joan,
I remember a little girl who believed in magic.
as I look at you right now...
I see a grown woman who has seen all the magic in the world come true tonight.
Joan...
Joan likes magic...
this is harder than I thought.
maybe if we all clap loudly...
she'll wrap it up.
because you and Umberto are making magic here tonight.
well, it was worth a try...
and I know that, if you could, you'd share that feeling with me.
and I know that you'll share him with me.
Oh!
OK. It appears our best man has run out of Italian, so cheers.
I liked your toast.
thank you. Umberto's brother already hit on me, and most of his family thinks I'm a pervert, but thanks.
they do that for good luck.
so where did you learn to speak Italian so poorly?
Syracuse. Umberto and I were roommates.
he taught me how to talk to girls in Italian, and I taught him American football.
I wanted to ask you before...
who is your service provider? - Uh, why?
I saw you e-mailing earlier, and I kind of have signal envy.
give me your phone. I need to send one quick work e-mail.
if I don't... - No, you can't have my phone.
why not? - Because you're just gonna take my number.
I'm not gonna take your number. - You're gonna take my phone and call your phone with it so that you have my number, and I can't have you booty-calling me - at 2: 30 in the morning. - I'm not go...
wait! You know what? I do. I need it.
because I need to block it from my phone.
I can't give it to you, because Umberto made me turn it off.
so it's on vibrate? - No, it's off.
like "off" off? - Yeah.
Nicholas! - Ah, Father Dino!
Nicholas! - Father...
all right.
maybe some cards again tonight? Some Texas holding them?
I don't think so. You cleaned me out at Umberto's bachelor party.
no more cards for me, pal. - Wow.
I take my vows only six months ago.
they say it's a work in the progress.
sure. - Forgive me.
come on, Father. It's ok.
it's just a card game. It's ok.
it's ok. No more cards.
it's ok.
look at those two. - Tell me he's a good guy.
Ah, he's a saint. Her? - An angel.
Oh, a saint and an angel. I give it a year.
I would not even give it six months.
this marriage has the shelf life of a banana.
they've known each other two weeks.
that's not even enough time for a credit check.
what? - Nothing.
Hey!
no, wait! I don't want to... No, wait!
uh, it's my bad.
sorry about that.
go ahead.
what are you...
I'm sorry. - Oh, yeah. It's mine.
just put that back in there. Thank you.
Hey!
Hey.
what did he just yell at you? - Nothing.
what? - Nothing.
it means "the hit."
I played some football in college and...
I took kind of a big hit.
football. Goats. You get hit a lot.
it's kind of a famous hit.
it's not exactly what you want to be known for.
but it's football. Doesn't everyone get hit in football?
I got hit by lightning. Ok?
on the field. In a game.
Oh... - Yeah.
see, I get that look a lot.
it's Ok. It's Ok.
aside from a slight peripheral vision issue, I'm fine.
Oh! Yeah? - Mmm... hmm.
you smell like lavender.
you smell like livestock.
you're not so tough.
Beth! It's time to cut the cake.
Oh... all right.
he looks nice.
but so did your father.
you seen her? - No.
be open to it, Beth.
trust in love, Beth.
believe in magic, Beth.
Mmm... hmm.
what the hell.
come on. There you go.
OK...
of course.
what an idiot.
what are you looking at? Fountain of Love.
what a crock. I mean, we wait our whole lives for some perfect guy to come in and sweep us off our feet.
well, guess what. He's not coming.
each one of you is a desperate wish for love that is never gonna come true.
so I'm saving you.
and...
saving you.
you, I don't give a damn about.
but I am saving you.
magic.
and you... - So beautiful.
thank you.
and I'm saving you.
Hey, Father Dino. - Nicholas.
OOP, the love police.
hello. - Oh, hey. Hey, it's Nick.
Nick who?
Beamon. From the wedding. - What's taking him so long?
Joan gave me your number. - Of course she did.
uh, I wasn't really expecting to get you.
want me to hang up so you can talk to the machine?
no. This is good. - Yo, Nick! What's going on?
did you get lost? Grab some beers! Let's do this!
I'm looking for the bottle opener.
it's on the fridge. See it from here.
dude, you gave me the instruction card.
that's a helpful card. - Why is it wet?
I put it in a glass of water. - Why would you do that?
I don't know. - That's weird.
I was thinking maybe we could have dinner later?
uh, I'm already having dinner.
Oh. Maybe a drink? Some coffee?
Nope. - Which part no?
the drink or the coffee? - Nick!
umm, it's just sort of a blanket nope.
Nick, how long you gonna take?
we watched Roots while you were gone!
maybe I'm a little off base here, but I thought that we hit it off the other night, no?
Yeah, Nick, you're a little off base.
who would win in a fight? A whale or a silverback gorilla?
definitely a whale.
it also depends if they're in water or not.
what about, like, a couple silverback gorillas?
if they're in water, they'll lose.
don't think they swim good?
I think they swim well. I don't know if they swim good.
let's be an English major, why don't we?
dude, what took you so long?
I didn't have a beard when you left.
nice. What's this?
what's it look like? - A bottle opener.
use that to open beer bottles? That would've been nice, beers.
that would've been nice. That would've been great.
Whoa! You didn't call some chick - during our game, did you? - No!
you don't mind if I hit redial? That wouldn't bother you?
no, no, no, no. Give me that! - Hello? I love you.
so touchy all of a sudden. - I'm not touchy.
you're sensitive all of a sudden.
I'm not... I'm not sensitive.
that's what a sensitive person would say.
Yeah, whatever.
methinks some girl has put a spell on you.
No!
wait! I just need to see your feet!
OK, I chase. No problem.
this is a great view from behind.
wait!
now the game is on!
in Italia, when a woman run away, it means she love you!
you must love me so much! Bella, wait! Wait!
how can I prove my love to you, if you won't stop?!
mi amore, I just need one moment with your feet!
I'm coming!
uh... oh!
you out of your frigging mind, dude?
are you ok?
I don't know what you're saying. What's he saying?
I don't know. I don't speak idiot.
please, allow me...
to see your magnifico feet. - What? No! Ew!
Hey, this is you.
and this one, too. - Let me explain.
my name is Antonio Guiseppe Donatello.
I'm from the village of Nunzio in Italia.
I... Oh, my spleen. It's ok.
two days ago, I have a vision.
I see the face of love, your face.
then I see your neck, your torso, your...
Oh, got it. I get it.
but... I could not paint your feet.
you came all the way from Italy to paint my feet?
no, also to earn your love.
I think you have me confused with someone else.
put some ice on it and be careful.
OK! I will paint your face on every building in this city until you recognize my love!
Hi. I'm kind of in a hurry, so... Thanks.
no problem.
isn't this place the greatest?
you can get your work done, no one bothers you.
food's great. Low carb, high protein.
it's really the only way to go when your work requires you to be shredded and dieseled out.
Oh, yeah, here, don't crane your neck.
go ahead. Feast your eyes. Yes, I've seen that look before.
you're intimidated because I'm a model.
but I don't want you to be scared, ok? I'm a normal guy.
this is my portfolio. It's kind of my calling card.
these are mostly non-paying jobs, or spec work.
I think that's a Real Dog.
and here's the Crown Jewel. I am the Gasee guy. So...
Wow. - I'm Gale.
like a gale-force wind.
I took on that name because it's the most powerful force in the natural world.
for shaping and eroding the earth, it's...
you can feel it.
actually, I think that's water, eroding the earth.
don't think it's water. I think it's wind.
like the Grand Canyon. - I'm gonna look that up.
this is crazy. I don't know whether to look at my own reflection or at you, - that's how beautiful you are. - You know what? I have to go.
OK, you asked for it.
Yeah, she's back. Hi. - You can't just take your shirt off.
I don't hear any complaints from the peanut gallery, so...
put your shirt back on, creep. - Here you go.
I know this looks nuts, all right?
and maybe I am a little nuts because I've never tried to share my beauty with anyone before.
and I think it's because I'm in love with you. Big time.
great first date, Beth!
let's get another one on the books soon.
come on, man, put your shirt on.
honestly though, is there a doctor here, because there's some kind of weird swelling in this...
Yeah, that can't be normal, can it? Humans aren't...
jeez, Louise, dessert's served.
sit down, Gas guy.
Oh, sorry. - Excuse me, miss. Miss?
I believe you dropped this.
Oh, my... Yeah, thank you.
I don't know how that fell off. Thanks.
miss?
how did you?
time flies, but magic flies faster.
Oh, you're a street magician.
I really appreciate it, but I don't have the time right now.
you have all the time in the world.
damn it. All right, now it's getting kind of creepy because you must have just touched me, and I didn't feel anything.
pick a card, and I'll show you my heart.
come on, do it! - Do it!
if I pick a card, will you stop stealing my watch?
probably. - Ok.
take a good look. Don't show it to me.
wasn't gonna. - Place it back in the deck.
ready, everyone? - Wow.
that's not my card.
I know... Because the joker is me.
a fool for love. I told you I'd show you my heart.
EW!
Oh!
is this your card?
get over here. Little help here, please.
Hey, little girl, could you please give me my heart?
is it me, or is New York getting crazier?
your sister's on line two. - Take a message.
she says it's kind of important. - Fine. Patch her through.
Hi, Joan.
what were you doing in the Fontana d'Amore - during my wedding? - What makes you think that...
I'm looking at a picture of you.
it's front-page news over here, sis. What were you thinking?
I don't know. Little bit of jet lag, little bit of champagne, or a lot of champagne.
and the next thing I know, I'm sitting in the fountain picking up coins.
she took coins from the fontana? That's not so good.
why not so good? - There is a legend, if you take someone's coin from the fontana, they will fall in love with you.
Oh! Except that is ridiculous. - Ok. Then we hang up!
I totally believe in magic coins.
were you on that call? - Love is finally at your doorstep.
so have any men come on to you since the wedding?
well... - Oh, my God. They have been.
Yeah, a couple of weirdos approached me this morning...
but... - There are some magical forces at work here.
I don't believe in magic. Know what I do believe in?
art. Where's my Slater Bradley?
told you I was on top of it.
the insurance company totally wanted to jack up the rate, so in an effort to be more assertive, I told them to shove it.
you told Hillman and Craft to shove it?
Yeah. - That piece was coming from a collector in Australia.
even if we got it on a jet today, it would never clear customs in time for the gala.
that means I have no centerpiece for the Circle of Gold.
I'll get Hillman and Craft on the phone. I'll be quick.
I don't think I burned that bridge. - No, no. It's too late now. I...
I have to tell Celeste.
Hello?
Oh, hey. Did I mention Joan gave me your cell number, too?
little busy now. What do you want? - Same thing I wanted last night.
what is it going to take for me to convince you - that I'm not interested in you? - What is it going to take?
Ah, it's going to take you looking me in the eye to tell me that.
that'd require seeing you, and I don't have the time for that right...
Hi. - Oh, so you're stalking me now?
no, I'm just running into you in a premeditated manner.
Nick, I have a big problem on my hands right now.
I just lost the centerpiece to my show.
Beth? - Celeste.
this is Mr Al Russo, our newest patron.
he asked specifically to see you.
um, of course. Um, hi. Um...
I'm sorry. Have we met before? - In my dreams.
Beth has secured a rare Slater Bradley as the centerpiece for our Pain Exhibit.
actually, Celeste...
Nick Beamon? Are you Nick Beamon? - Yeah.
Oh, Nick the Hit! You want to talk about pain, this guy...
a million volts in the neck. - That's fascinating.
Beth, you do have the Slater Bradley, yes?
Celeste, it's... - My fault, and I was meaning to tell you...
actually, she has access to something even better.
this is really not the time, Nick. - An original Petrocelli.
the title of the photograph is Anguish.
and it too has never been viewed in public.
a Petrocelli that's never been viewed?
that's right. Damian Petrocelli himself agreed to give me the print - and burn the negative. - Why would he do that?
because I happen to be the subject of the photo.
and I'm willing to relive that humiliation in public because I know that as long as Beth is involved, it will be in good hands.
how about that private tour we're gonna have?
follow me.
including Cezanne, Degas, Manet, Picasso and Van Gogh...
they're just really nicely spaced.
you did such a great job.
let me... I have something for you. This is a gift for you.
Oh, my.
it's not from Tiffany.
sausage. That's your face. - Yeah, that's it.
I... This may sound a little odd to you, but encased meat is my life's work.
I am like a curator, just like you. A curator of sausage.
well, passion is passion. - That's exactly what I say.
I mean there is not an emotion on earth that can't be expressed through sausage.
and that bratwurst is saying, "hello, and thank you for showing me the museum."
who knew bratwurst could even say all that?
Beth. - Please tell me you're here because you have a deep appreciation for modern art.
I have a deep appreciation, but for you, Beth.
that's it. Tour's over.
I know it seems crazy. It's crazy to me too.
want to play cat and mouse? I can play cat and mouse.
you forgot your sausages!
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm so sorry. - Oh, it hurts.
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that was you. I didn't...
I'm really sorry.
it hurts so bad, but tastes so good.
what is that, mint? - It's breath spray.
you startled me, I didn't have anything else. I am so sorry.
can I see it? Take your hands away.
you're gonna make it worse. - I'm not gonna make it worse.
don't be such a baby. I really feel awful.
I did not know that it would hurt that bad.
it doesn't hurt that bad. I was just playing.
you think you're real charming, don't you?
little bit. - Yeah. Well, you are. Ok?
what? - Ok.
where are you going?
I know your type of guy, Nick.
and what type is that?
come on. The girl in the red dress kissing you at the fountain?
you saw that? - Yeah.
that's why you've been cold the last couple of days.
is that so hard to believe?
that was Umberto's crazy cousin, OK?
you know the blood runs a little hot in that family.
Yeah, you seemed so sick about it.
I was a little sick about it. Especially after I met you.
wait!
Oh, no. Let's go this way.
Hey, Beth! It's me, Al Russo! - Oh, let's cross.
Whoa! Wait one second.
one second! - I'm sorry, Nick! I gotta go!
just... - I'm sorry. I gotta go.
hold on! Beth! Beth, wait.
Ah!
Ah, I did not see that one coming!
OK, Lance, you can do this. Just have to believe.
I will do the Great Mummy Escape, and Beth will love me.
this worked for Houdini, it should work for me.
OK, here she comes.
well, I don't know, Joan. OK? I don't know what I believe anymore.
all I know is that this is crazy, and I need it to stop.
we told you this would happen.
OK, then what is it gonna take for me to end this little nightmare?
you have to return the coins to the Fontana d'Amore.
wait, that's it?
and spell broken, and these guys leave me alone?
I'm overnighting you the coins right now.
that's no good. She needs to return the coins herself.
I cannot just fly back to Italy to put some magic coins into a fountain.
there's got to be another way we can handle this.
try and enjoy the attention? - Joan...
Beth! It's me, Lance.
I'm setting a record for you.
I know this looks scary and dangerous, but if I can do this, get out of the straitjacket...
stop! Stop!
what are you doing in my apartment?
blowing your mind!
no one's ever done the Mummy Escape in under three minutes.
Juan, what's my time? - Three minutes and 53 seconds.
I don't know. That felt pretty tight.
are you sure you timed that right?
you know, you want to find the rabbit, you got to work the hat.
you're just not putting in the hours, bro.
not in front of my girlfriend. - Who the hell is that?
that's Juan, my assistant.
he's just been video chronicling all my illusions. Anyway...
both of you, out of my apartment, now.
no, wait. Now listen up.
Oh, my goodness. Your perfume is intoxicating, and your hair smells like cinnamon!
get out!
Hey, Nick... - Douche.
you get those old giant photos I asked you for?
I am a professional photographer.
I'm not your Girl Friday, ok?
I would appreciate some respect, but yes, here.
or, in lieu of respect, I'd appreciate you and me chatting up two ladies and leaving the one that knows more about Wookiees alone with this.
I'm not gonna be able to make that party.
what? No, Saturday night is the ESPN party.
that's a work and play event, dude. Oh, my God. It's the girl.
the museum girl, isn't it? I knew it. - You don't understand.
you should see this girl. I can barely keep up with her.
she's smart.
she's beautiful. She's funny.
Oh, my God, no. Stop it! Stop liking her!
do not go any further until I can do a little recon on this girl.
recon? What are you, Black Ops? No, absolutely not.
what do you really know about her?
I'm not going to let my boy go in there blind.
puck! No! - No?
No! - No?
no. - How about yes?
OK, go.
Hey! Look at you!
look at me, we look great!
I can't jog. I have a weak hamstring.
it's OK. I nearly die. But I...
robert Longo, Kiki Smith, Carl Riddle...
Mm-hm.
Wow! That looks great!
let's be beautiful together. Where you going? Beth!
it's gonna come back around in four minutes.
it's gonna be great!
I can explain.
there's a nude mural of you on 82nd Street. Should we start there?
I know. That is actually a funny...
could we start somewhere else? - Flowers everywhere!
a sudden, unexplained change in the program for the Circle of Gold gala.
I need to have confidence in my curators, Beth...
you wouldn't believe if...
you're right.
I'm sorry. - You promised me this program - would go off without a hitch. - It will.
let me be perfectly clear. If it doesn't, I'll see to it that the only artwork you're ever allowed near are the velvet Elvis paintings for sale in Times Square.
got it? - Yeah.
this is gonna be a serious blow to your self-esteem.
maybe you should sit down.
remember that girl? The one you wanted to settle down with?
the one you wanted to be little soccer dad with?
well, guess what. Mama's a bigger player than you, son!
shazam! Check it out.
foreign guys, old dudes, Houdini, a half-naked gentleman.
this girl sees more action in one afternoon than you saw in your whole senior season.
look, I'm sorry, man, but it's all there.
it's pretty clear what I have to do.
Yeah.
I got to pick up my game.
Ow!
I was just thinking about you. - I was just thinking of you.
I'm sorry I ran off the other day.
I've just been having one of those weeks.
Yeah, so it would seem. Is everything OK?
Yeah, there's a lot I would like to tell you.
unfortunately, I need to cut to the chase. Back her up a bit.
my fundraiser at the museum, it's tomorrow, - and I need to get my hands on that... - The Petrocelli.
I'm kind of wavering on that now.
but that's the centerpiece to my pain exhibit.
Yeah, but have you thought at all about my pain, my suffering?
what? - I would feel better about it if we could sit down, talk about it, maybe over dinner?
I know this place called Blackout on Bleecker.
I was thinking 8：00? - So you're blackmailing me now?
actually, it's extortion. - If I come to dinner, - can I have my Petrocelli? - I got to run. See you at 8: 00!
you have a date, huh? - It's not a date.
so, what are you gonna wear?
my navy blouse, a pencil skirt, and some open-toed slingbacks.
Hey. - Hey.
Wow. You look great.
Oh, I didn't really have time to get ready. Um...
so this is it?
Yeah. It's supposed to get a lot better in the back.
OK. - Look, we got off on the wrong foot.
actually, we got off on the right foot, and Umberto's cousin messed everything...
I don't even want to talk about that right now.
I just wanted to tell you ever since that night in Rome...
Hi! My name is Ilona, and I'll be your sensory guide this evening.
tonight you will enjoy a delicious gourmet meal without your primary sense of sight.
in this way your other senses will become heightened to bring you an exciting, new culinary experience.
is she serious?
Yeah. Our last great moment was the night the lights went out in Rome, so I figured we'd pick up where we left off.
that's beautiful. Please take my hand and I will lead you to your table.
let's make a train.
here we are. Now, just follow me. Stay close.
just let your eyes take a back seat while your senses do the driving.
it's furniture.
that's a chair. Very good. Very good.
you wouldn't have gotten to feel that chair if your eyes...
Oh, my. Oh, my!
I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. - What an adventure.
all right. That's a head. That's a man's head.
there are so many people! - I think I broke something.
just keep coming forward. That's a woman, sir.
sorry. - All right.
here's your table. Now follow my voice to the chair.
follow my voice to the chair. - Right here?
Where's my voice? Your butt should go about here.
I know you can't see this, but you've got a gentleman.
let me help you with your jacket.
it's a struggle because of your muscles. Jeez!
Yeah. - And here we are.
are you smelling me?
OK. So, in just a few minutes, your wine will be out.
if you need anything at all, just raise your hand, and one of our attendants will assist you.
remember, you can't see us, but we can see you.
this is... This is kind of...
kind of cool. - Creepy.
it's awesome! - I thought you had left.
your wine is being poured in front of you at two o'clock. Enjoy.
there you go.
I hope you didn't order anything expensive.
she could have switched it to a cheap bottle and we'd have no way of knowing.
still here. And I would never do that, ever.
you going to be there the whole meal, or...
no. I'm going to let the two of you get to know each other on a deeper level, and I'm going to go touch other people in the restaurant.
OK, then. Thank you. - Sure.
I think she's finally gone. It's really dark.
I'll tell you this. Even in the dark you're beautiful.
this is actually kind of nice.
this is the best I've felt since Rome.
Beth, it's me! Al Russo.
I've been looking all over for you. - Who's this?
your liverwurst nightmare, pal. - Oh, no.
Ah, the feet...
look who it is, principessa.
meatball! - Sausage king!
does anyone have... the time?
Oh, God. - Hey, my watch is missing.
try being gorgeous, and no one can see you.
who is that? - Waiter?
feel like I'm driving a Lamborghini around with a car cover on.
ordered an eight-pack? Please enjoy.
Nick, I had a great time, but I got to go!
"great time?" We just got here! Beth, wait. Beth...
Ow!
ma'am! - What the hell is going on?
people really drop a lot of food in this place.
are you dark dining and dashing?
I had her, and you blew it.
he make her disappear with magic.
bring her back, warlock!
Taxi!
Beth! - Please, just let me go.
do you mind telling me what the hell just happened there?
how many guys are you seeing? - I'm not see...
you don't... Those guys don't know me.
they're just under a... spell.
Beth! Beth, hi!
why don't you leave me alone! I don't know you!
Beth, it's me. Your dentist. Dr. Moscowitz.
Oh.
sorry, Dr. Moscowitz. Hi. - Everything OK?
Oh, God, yeah.
and I'm flossing twice a day. - Oh, good.
I don't want to talk about it. - Your dentist? Are you Ok?
I just want to get out of here.
OK.
where do you want to go? - I don't...
where would you feel safe?
I used to come here with my parents when I was a little girl.
I thought this place was magic.
and my father told me that the roof was made of glass so that God could see the paintings from up in heaven.
Wow.
I know.
her name was Marie-Therese Walter.
she was 17 when Picasso fell in love with her.
Picasso was already married, and 30 years her senior, so they kept their affair a secret.
but he documented his passion by hiding her initials in some of his paintings.
of course, Picasso wasn't completely ready to settle down, and he left Marie-Therese for Dora Maar just like he left his wife Olga for Marie-Therese.
but Marie-Therese never stopped loving Picasso.
and she hung herself after his death.
hey...
you OK?
she just loved him so much, and in the end, he didn't really love her back.
it's just sad.
you know, it doesn't always have to be that way.
every time I've ever put myself out there, I've gotten hurt.
every time.
it's like I meet a guy, and I think it's great.
and anyone else would just be thinking about how much greater it's going to get.
and I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.
you know, lightning does strike once in a while, Beth.
trust me. I know.
I wish I could believe that.
you can. No other shoes are going to drop, Beth.
this is real.
I'm real.
damn it! - It's OK.
it's OK. - One second.
six beers enter, no beers leave!
what are you doing? Come on.
is she here? What's her name? Betsy?
I hate you. You're ruining my life.
aha, you found it. - Oh, it's so beautiful.
and so sad. - Yeah, it's OK.
you know, every time I look at that, all I think about is...
everything football meant to me and my family and especially my old man.
all the dreams... gone in an instant.
that was the real hit.
Oh, no.
what? - I have to go.
what's wrong? We can slow down.
I just have to go. - Hold on, hold on.
hold on. Hey!
I don't get it. - I know you don't, Nick.
and you probably never will.
but it's not real. And it's never going to be real.
what about the photograph?
keep it.
I don't want to see you in pain.
is this all the programs? I don't want to forget any.
everything's gonna be Ok, Beth. I know it will.
no, it's not.
it's his chip. He's just under a spell. It's not real.
hello. - Listen, I have great news.
umberto talked to his nana.
she said there's another way to break the spell.
there is? - Yeah.
all you have to do is return the coins directly to the guys.
it doesn't have to be the fountain.
return the coin, return the love.
if I return the coins, I return the love?
Yeah.
that'll break the spell?
and that'll get me out of this whole mess?
Yeah! It'll be all over. Isn't that great?
Yeah. It's great. - I knew you'd be relieved.
this is for your own good, boss.
it's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah! Oh, I got to go. Good luck at the show tonight.
I'll call you later.
I love you, OK? Bye! - Ok.
Hey, boss, I'm gonna start setting up. I'll see you at the Gugg.
Wow.
come on in.
OK.
it's nice here. Very nice.
I like what you do. It's sort of modern.
very nice place. - Beautiful.
really nice. You look great. Are you excited for the show?
you OK? You seem sad.
this is going to be harder than I thought. Um...
I'm actually glad that you're all here.
just because I need to tell you something.
Oh.
come here.
the couch. You can sit on the couch.
you're gonna tell us on the couch? - Yeah.
I think she's gonna pick one of us.
like The Bachelor. I love this show, with the rose.
I like my odds. - It's you, it's you.
um...
I don't know any other way to say this, other than to just...
you don't love me.
trust me, I love you. - No, you don't.
they don't, but I do. - I love you so much.
well, I was drunk, but I took the coins. I took your coins.
I do love you. - It's not real. You don't love me.
as much as I can love someone. - No, you don't.
we're not in love with each other. I'm in love with someone else. I love Nick.
I love Nick.
I love Nick more than I love my job, which is big for me.
and it's not your fault, and I'm really sorry.
I love him even if he might not love me back.
you know?
I understand loving somebody and...
them not loving you back.
we all do.
it's a bummer. - This really suck.
I'm sorry, guys.
OK...
the whole point of love is to put someone else's needs above your own.
maybe that's why I'm here. Maybe that's why we're all here.
maybe for you.
he may be on to something. - No, it's true.
how can we help? - Thanks, guys.
and this will all be a little clearer when I give you something back.
Oh, no.
Stacy.
what the heck is? - What?
that was weird. - I swear, that wasn't me.
it was just...
freak electrical storm has caused rolling blackouts and gridlock throughout the city. Traffic lights are out throughout the metro area.
new York City is at a standstill.
we got to stay in. - I make food for everybody. We eat.
no, no, no. We're not staying here. You're not staying here.
I need to be at the Guggenheim. This has to end now.
after we eat.
hold it, hold it.
if we love her, we'll get her to the Guggenheim. That's all there is to it.
let's do this.
I'll do it. And I'm going to do it with more flair than all of you.
we take my car. I just bring her from Italia.
you have a car? - It's molto grande.
for one, two... No, it be fine.
come on! Move it!
comfortable up there? - Where's the keys?
I had the keys in your apartment.
have the key. - Give him the keys.
Ay-yay-yay!
I am what I am. - Annoying.
who makes this car, Fisher-Price?
in Italia this is a midsize car.
in America it's a clown car.
careful.
it's Stacy. Leave a message. - Stacy, please call me when you get this.
and don't do anything with those coins. I'm on my way.
I was expecting a little bit bigger. - Oh, tiny bit, huh?
hit the horn. Thread the needle. See if you can go around this guy.
just drive like you're in Rome. - No problem.
Hey, coming through!
I'm OK.
if you can't reach the dashboard, and you wanna hold onto the washboards, let me know.
there's a fat guy on a bike. A fat guy on a bike.
sorry about that.
I'll give you a thousand bucks to let me sit in front.
OK, that hurt. - Damn it!
come on up.
there's the Gugg!
coming through!
you can just let me out here. - No, it's not close enough.
I take you right upstairs.
no, Antonio. The doors! - I got this. You must all believe.
I don't believe! - I don't believe!
I believe!
open!
I did it!
could you push five?
Stacy.
Beth. There you are. You're a hit. They love the show.
the Petrocelli is... How?
Nick sent it over late this afternoon. People cried when they saw it.
and Celeste is... - Pleased.
we've already received a record number of financial pledges tonight, Beth.
I'm very proud of you. You're a wonderful curator.
anyone who would care to join me in the Thannhauser, please come this way.
Stacy... I need the coins.
but look at what's happened, Beth. Nick did all of this for you.
he loves you. - I know.
but if I take his love against his will, that's not love at all.
please, Stacy. The coins. I have to do this my way.
you are not going to the Guggenheim.
this isn't my scene.
what are you talking about? We're neck-deep in hot ladies.
lt is here. What up, son?
LT! - Man, what's your damn problem?
he knows his name. Where are you going?
Hey, how's it going? We're from the network.
good to see you. We're big fans. We read your column every week.
thank you.
somebody we wanted to introduce you to. Nick, Shaq.
how you doing? Read your article. - Oh. Yeah?
spelled my name wrong. - It's the proofreading department.
this guy right here? - Yeah, this guy.
no, not me.
excuse me, I've got to take this phone call.
you don't know how to spell? - I don't know anything.
Beth. Hey, how are you?
Nick, there's something I want to tell you.
even though it won't matter after tonight.
I want to thank you... for making me believe in love again.
even if it wasn't real for you, it was very real for me.
what does that mean?
Beth. Beth!
Hey!
I'm guessing this belongs to you?
does it?
check your purse.
OK, stop it. I need you to take this.
come on. Close your hand.
wait, I have another trick. - Nope.
now I remember.
I never had the guts to perform in public until I wanted to do it for you. I guess I just needed a muse.
what am I going to do without you?
you'll find your muse. Your true muse.
trust me, you won't be sorry.
are you a coin collector?
when I threw this coin in the fountain
I wasn't wishing that my wife would come back.
I knew that wouldn't happen.
I was just wishing to get a chance to feel the way I did when she was around.
and...
my wish came true. You gave me that.
thank you.
Hey!
Oh, come on!
is this your euro?
that's weird. - Antonio?
it's Anthony, actually. - From Nunzio?
no. Newark. New Jersey. - Are you really a tortured artist?
tortured. Been in retail shoe sales for the last nine years.
as far as being an artist, I guess I figured going to Italy'd make me one.
I think you're an artist.
I do. And I'm not just saying that because I'm trying to get rid of you.
it's my professional opinion. - Thank you.
I think I'll miss you least of all.
honestly, I don't think I really learned anything.
no? - But man, I had a blast helping you grow.
you're welcome.
Mmm.
good luck. It's all right.
what's going on here? - All the lights are out.
some kind of freak electrical storm.
I wouldn't cross there if I were you! That's suicide, pal!
crap, not again.
Oh, I didn't see that one coming.
that was both our faults, really. - What are you doing here?
come on, you didn't think I was going to let my boy do this alone, did you?
Oh, I feel safer. Thank you. - Does she have a sister?
she's married. - Dammit.
come on. Get in.
you know, you're buying me a new windshield, right?
don't kick my car. I'll hit you again! - Yeah, I'm Ok, by the way.
I'm fine. Don't worry about me. - Good. I don't care.
and I guess there's one more.
looking for something?
I need that.
Oopsie-daisy, where'd it go?
Oh, there they are.
now, there's two.
back to one. - Give it to me!
so, I guess it's over now, huh?
is that really what you want? - It doesn't matter what I want.
you've got your will back.
ever since I saw you in that fountain something...
something changed in me. I can't eat. I can't sleep.
I can't do anything without thinking about you.
I don't know what is going on with me, Beth but I want to know what is going on with you.
you seem to think that all these guys are under some kind of crazy spell or something, and that I'm one of them, but I'm not. This is real, OK?
and I ran all the way up Fifth Avenue in a lightning storm - because I wanted to tell you... - You love me?
I never said I loved you. - You didn't. No, you don't.
no, no, no, I just never said it.
you said it, and I wanted to say it, but...
OK, you go. You say it. Oh, well, say it if you want to say it.
look...
the only spell that I'm under...
is yours.
I'm in love with you, Beth.
Oh. Did she invite you, too? - Yeah. Tony.
gale. - Yeah.
nice to see you. - Yeah. You, too.
you look great. That's a nice cut.
you look terrific.
beautiful silhouette. I saw you out there.
you can hold a suit. Yeah.
you're an artist. - Yeah. Sort of.
I would love to do a nude with you.
I'd like that.
great.
I'd really like that.
I am really sorry about this, Beth. This is all my fault.
I found that in my bag of tricks.
it's not mine, so... - Oh, my God. It's Nick's.
I guess I accidentally gave you the wrong chip in the museum.
he's still under the spell.
OK, thank you. Time to go. - Are you her sister?
well, would you like to see an illusion? - Bye-bye.
don't you want to be dazzled?
Oh, my God, Beth. I'm so sorry. - What am I going to do?
showtime.
dad.
when you married Mom, did you ever think that you wouldn't make it?
Elizabeth Ann.
honey, you cannot learn from my mistakes.
you're gonna have to go out there and make your own.
now, you could get your heart broken or you could have the greatest love affair the world has ever known, but you're not gonna know unless you try.
but what if there was a guarantee that you'd never get hurt.
baby... The passion is in the risk.
it's like I always say, "if you're going to be a bear...
be a grizzly." - That's my girl.
a marriage is like all contracts that the two enter under the eyes of Our Father Almighty.
if there's anybody here who has reasons that Beth...
and Nicholas should not get married today, speak now or forever hold on to your peaces.
anybody?
anybody?
anybody?
it could be anybody. You don't have to know them to speak up.
OK, padre, it seems nobody's objecting, so let's move on with it.
do you, Nicholas, take Beth to be your awful wedded wife?
"Lawful." Yes. Yes, I do.
what is with him?
and do you, Beth, take Nicholas to be your awful wedded husband?
to love, amore, to honor until morte, death, do you part?
think, bella. It's a very big responsibility, no?
no.
I can't do this to you, Nick. I'm sorry.
you think you're pretty funny, don't you?
did you enjoy watching me go crazy?
did you have fun watching my life turn upside down because of love?
because I did.
Beth!
Beth!
I've got a question.
why do you keep giving me my poker chips?
because you deserve to have it back.
you threw it in the fountain and wished for love, and I don't want to keep it anymore.
no, I didn't. - You didn't?
no. - Then who did?
I have no idea.
then this is all real?
how's this for real?
free of temptation!
didn't you say at Umberto's bachelor party...
the padre cleaned me out at the poker table. Yeah.
great job, you guys.
has anyone seen Stacy?
Stacy? Stacy, where are you guys?
Oh, hey boss. Table four. Come meet us.
Hey, did you check out that cute guy by the Monet?
the one breathing on the Monet?
I called security.
I think it's best to steer clear of him, given my track record.
Ooh, is that for me?
no, no, that's my... - Thanks! I'm starving!
the show is going great. To Beth!
our fearless leader. - Job well done.
thank you, guys.
Oh, my God. Is that Brady Sacks?
Beth's ex? Where?
not a funny joke. And I'll tell you why.
because if Brady had the nerve to show up here,
I mean at my event, no less, after he...
dumped you like yesterday's trash? - Ripped your heart out and fed it to the Central Park pigeons?
come on, I'm not even over your breakup yet.
well, I am, Ok? In a big way. Brady Sacks?
who cares? That's what I say.
he's right behind me, isn't he?
Brady... - Oh, yeah...
great show. - Great show, guys.
I hate this.
uh, what are you doing here?
look, I know you're crazy busy, but there's something I need to say to you.
something I think'll make up for what I put you through.
uh... Ok.
I've got three words for you, Beth Martin.
I was wrong. - Did he just say he was wrong?
a year ago, when I broke up with you, I felt like you cared more about your work than you did about me.
Yeah, I remember, Brady, really clearly, when you broke up with me in the Applebee's.
I'm sorry about that, but I'm here to tell you that...
I get it. - Can you hear?
barely. I think he said he gets it.
Oh, he gets it!
I'm ready to jump in again, in a big way.
you want to jump in again?
Yeah.
wow, uh...
Yeah. I mean, maybe. If it's slow.
you made me realize that it doesn't matter how hard someone works, as long as you love them enough.
Yes. I can't believe that you're saying that.
I'm just a little overwhelmed.
I met someone who works just as hard as you do, only now I can accept her for that.
we're getting engaged! - Beth's getting engaged!
did I just hear that right?
our host and curator, Beth Martin, is getting engaged?
uh... Uh...
no, I'm not. I'm not getting engaged!
not tonight, not to him.
Oh, man.
but maybe. Maybe in the future sometime.
I don't know. With someone else.
got to see how it pans out. Ok?
well, at least it wasn't in the Applebee's.
worst day ever.
Joan? - Sis! Guess what?
I'm getting married!
Yay.
his name is Umberto. Umberto! How sexy is that?
we met on a flight to Italy two weeks ago, and now we're getting married. In Rome.
Wow. That... Joan. Wow.
he's the one, Beth. I know it. I can't wait until you meet him.
and when I do, I will have known him for almost as long as you have.
you know what? You're not exactly a role model when it comes to relationships.
OK, maybe not, but that is because I have a relationship with my job.
I love my job. And when I find a guy that I like more than my job, that's how I'll know he's the one.
OK, so basically what you need is a male version of yourself.
well, he doesn't have to be blonde.
you know that I mean this with all the love in the world, but two weeks, Joan?
that's not long enough.
that's not even enough time for a credit check.
when you know, you don't need proof. You just know.
be happy for me, B. - God, I am! I am.
I am.
she's doomed. I mean, come on, you meet some Italian guy in first class, you date him.
you don't marry him. - She's so lucky.
just imagine working in a place where they sort men into classes.
what? I'm just saying.
my baby sister is about to make the biggest mistake of her life, and there's nothing I can do about it.
she got swept away. It happens.
no, it doesn't.
instead of chasing a fairy tale, you could focus on work. That's what I do.
and you know what? I've never been happier.
well, you must be ecstatic.
and still single, I understand.
it appears we can begin. In nine days, we'll be hosting the single most important event of our year,
the Board of Trustees' Annual Circle of Gold Gala.
this year, the special installation for the event is the brainchild of our youngest and therefore least-experienced curator.
an exhibition centered on the theme of pain. Status report.
fourteen of our pieces are already on site, and three of the remaining four are on route.
and the remaining piece? - Is the Slater Bradley?
Yes, the centerpiece for the exhibition, where is it?
we're resolving some last-minute insurance issues.
Last-minute? I can't say I like the sound of that.
it'll be here. I'll make sure of it.
moving on...
Ah, there is one small little detail.
the day after tomorrow, my sister will be getting married.
in Rome. Italy.
well, that simply won't do.
well, it's my baby sister's wedding.
well, we all have sisters, Beth.
Mmm.
I will stay on top of this from Rome.
I'll be in and out in 48 hours, and you have my word, Celeste.
the Circle of Gold Gala will go off without a hitch.
it better. You may be talented, Beth, but you're not irreplaceable.
have a nice trip.
so...
how long you stay Rome, eh?
uh, 48 hours and counting.
is not so much time. But lucky for you, it only takes a moment to see true beauty.
the Eternal City is the most romantic city in the world.
you never lived until you loved in Rome.
not a lot of reception around here, huh?
put down your phone and look, signora. Welcome to Roma!
did I mention I'm late for my sister's wedding?
many times. So much beauty!
and, finally, the magnificent Fontana d'Amore.
a place where romantics from all over the world come to wish for love.
old people, young people, ugly people.
they get so lost in love. It's nice!
Yes, nice, thank you.
and good luck!
Joan, the Amsale dress looks gorgeous.
Hi! Hi. - Beth, darling!
wow, look at you. You look exhausted.
Thanks, Mom. - She looks fine.
you look beautiful. - Thank you.
what happened to "don't see the bride before the wedding"?
isn't this bad luck? - Girls, we don't have time.
your father's current tramp of the month is waiting inside with your dress.
I heard that. And she's not a tramp.
she's a pro beach volleyball player. Hello, sweetheart.
Hi, Daddy.
how are you? - Exhausted.
Beth, this is Umberto, my fiance.
so, you're my sister too, now.
Yeah. - Come on.
you have to meet his family. They're a scream.
see if he has a brother.
dad! - Cousin.
slippery little... Come on.
how does he get service?
you're late, Nick. - I'm sorry.
Where's your tie? - Oh!
there we go.
I know, but I can't get an Internet signal.
I need to know that you're on top of the Slater Bradley situation.
Hey!
you're breaking up. Just whistle if you can hear me.
Stacy? - Ah, there's my girl.
taking care of business.
always. - Having a good time?
Oh, yeah. You know me, I love small, intimate weddings.
if you're gonna be a bear, be a grizzly, right?
I don't know what that means.
so, what do you think of Tina? - She seems very fit, Dad.
that's all you can say?
tan and odds-on favorite to catch the bouquet.
you're a very lucky man.
I only wish for you the feeling I have when I'm with her.
come on, Beth. Get going here. I want to throw another wedding.
you will. You're due for another wife pretty soon.
I'm sorry, that was a low blow.
quite a pair, huh?
you refuse to fall in love, and I can't stop.
promise me one thing.
when it comes, you'll be open to it.
I will try, Daddy. - There you are!
it's vase-breaking time. - It's what?
it's a tradition. The maid of honor shatters a vase, and the number of pieces symbolizes the years of happiness she wishes for the bride and groom.
Wow! That's a lot of pressure.
right? So smash it hard.
OK. - Ok.
I'm so sorry.
I was not aiming for that, but, man, I really nailed it.
she wishes them a life - of great tragedy! - No, I don't. No, I don't.
I just... I'm trying to break it. I'm really trying.
I cracked it!
OK. We're almost there. Excuse me.
die! Oh, man!
let's just go ahead and let me handle this.
Wow. You are... you're...
you're quite the determined little thing, aren't you?
Yeah, well, I cracked it before you smashed it.
I know. Yeah, I know.
I'm Nick, by the way. - Beth.
nice to meet you. I would've introduced myself earlier, but I was running a little late.
Yeah, I noticed.
I was in the hills doing an interview, and on my way back I kinda got hit by a goat.
Oh, my God! You hit a goat? - No, the goat hit me.
it wasn't my fault, and the goat's fine.
what are they saying? - It means "speech."
I think you're up again. There you go.
hello again.
I'm Beth, sister of the bride.
umm...
Umberto, though I haven't known you for very long...
uh...
I'm sorry. I don't speak any Italian.
Umberto, although I haven't known you very long...
I'm a little rusty, so if you stay away from any obscure idioms, that would be great.
Yeah. Sure. I'll keep it simple. - Thank you.
when I look at you, Joan,
I remember a little girl who believed in magic.
as I look at you right now...
I see a grown woman who has seen all the magic in the world come true tonight.
Joan...
Joan likes magic...
this is harder than I thought.
maybe if we all clap loudly...
she'll wrap it up.
because you and Umberto are making magic here tonight.
well, it was worth a try...
and I know that, if you could, you'd share that feeling with me.
and I know that you'll share him with me.
Oh!
OK. It appears our best man has run out of Italian, so cheers.
I liked your toast.
thank you. Umberto's brother already hit on me, and most of his family thinks I'm a pervert, but thanks.
they do that for good luck.
so where did you learn to speak Italian so poorly?
Syracuse. Umberto and I were roommates.
he taught me how to talk to girls in Italian, and I taught him American football.
I wanted to ask you before...
who is your service provider? - Uh, why?
I saw you e-mailing earlier, and I kind of have signal envy.
give me your phone. I need to send one quick work e-mail.
if I don't... - No, you can't have my phone.
why not? - Because you're just gonna take my number.
I'm not gonna take your number. - You're gonna take my phone and call your phone with it so that you have my number, and I can't have you booty-calling me - at 2: 30 in the morning. - I'm not go...
wait! You know what? I do. I need it.
because I need to block it from my phone.
I can't give it to you, because Umberto made me turn it off.
so it's on vibrate? - No, it's off.
like "off" off? - Yeah.
Nicholas! - Ah, Father Dino!
Nicholas! - Father...
all right.
maybe some cards again tonight? Some Texas holding them?
I don't think so. You cleaned me out at Umberto's bachelor party.
no more cards for me, pal. - Wow.
I take my vows only six months ago.
they say it's a work in the progress.
sure. - Forgive me.
come on, Father. It's ok.
it's just a card game. It's ok.
it's ok. No more cards.
it's ok.
look at those two. - Tell me he's a good guy.
Ah, he's a saint. Her? - An angel.
Oh, a saint and an angel. I give it a year.
I would not even give it six months.
this marriage has the shelf life of a banana.
they've known each other two weeks.
that's not even enough time for a credit check.
what? - Nothing.
Hey!
no, wait! I don't want to... No, wait!
uh, it's my bad.
sorry about that.
go ahead.
what are you...
I'm sorry. - Oh, yeah. It's mine.
just put that back in there. Thank you.
Hey!
Hey.
what did he just yell at you? - Nothing.
what? - Nothing.
it means "the hit."
I played some football in college and...
I took kind of a big hit.
football. Goats. You get hit a lot.
it's kind of a famous hit.
it's not exactly what you want to be known for.
but it's football. Doesn't everyone get hit in football?
I got hit by lightning. Ok?
on the field. In a game.
Oh... - Yeah.
see, I get that look a lot.
it's Ok. It's Ok.
aside from a slight peripheral vision issue, I'm fine.
Oh! Yeah? - Mmm... hmm.
you smell like lavender.
you smell like livestock.
you're not so tough.
Beth! It's time to cut the cake.
Oh... all right.
he looks nice.
but so did your father.
you seen her? - No.
be open to it, Beth.
trust in love, Beth.
believe in magic, Beth.
Mmm... hmm.
what the hell.
come on. There you go.
OK...
of course.
what an idiot.
what are you looking at? Fountain of Love.
what a crock. I mean, we wait our whole lives for some perfect guy to come in and sweep us off our feet.
well, guess what. He's not coming.
each one of you is a desperate wish for love that is never gonna come true.
so I'm saving you.
and...
saving you.
you, I don't give a damn about.
but I am saving you.
magic.
and you... - So beautiful.
thank you.
and I'm saving you.
Hey, Father Dino. - Nicholas.
OOP, the love police.
hello. - Oh, hey. Hey, it's Nick.
Nick who?
Beamon. From the wedding. - What's taking him so long?
Joan gave me your number. - Of course she did.
uh, I wasn't really expecting to get you.
want me to hang up so you can talk to the machine?
no. This is good. - Yo, Nick! What's going on?
did you get lost? Grab some beers! Let's do this!
I'm looking for the bottle opener.
it's on the fridge. See it from here.
dude, you gave me the instruction card.
that's a helpful card. - Why is it wet?
I put it in a glass of water. - Why would you do that?
I don't know. - That's weird.
I was thinking maybe we could have dinner later?
uh, I'm already having dinner.
Oh. Maybe a drink? Some coffee?
Nope. - Which part no?
the drink or the coffee? - Nick!
umm, it's just sort of a blanket nope.
Nick, how long you gonna take?
we watched Roots while you were gone!
maybe I'm a little off base here, but I thought that we hit it off the other night, no?
Yeah, Nick, you're a little off base.
who would win in a fight? A whale or a silverback gorilla?
definitely a whale.
it also depends if they're in water or not.
what about, like, a couple silverback gorillas?
if they're in water, they'll lose.
don't think they swim good?
I think they swim well. I don't know if they swim good.
let's be an English major, why don't we?
dude, what took you so long?
I didn't have a beard when you left.
nice. What's this?
what's it look like? - A bottle opener.
use that to open beer bottles? That would've been nice, beers.
that would've been nice. That would've been great.
Whoa! You didn't call some chick - during our game, did you? - No!
you don't mind if I hit redial? That wouldn't bother you?
no, no, no, no. Give me that! - Hello? I love you.
so touchy all of a sudden. - I'm not touchy.
you're sensitive all of a sudden.
I'm not... I'm not sensitive.
that's what a sensitive person would say.
Yeah, whatever.
methinks some girl has put a spell on you.
No!
wait! I just need to see your feet!
OK, I chase. No problem.
this is a great view from behind.
wait!
now the game is on!
in Italia, when a woman run away, it means she love you!
you must love me so much! Bella, wait! Wait!
how can I prove my love to you, if you won't stop?!
mi amore, I just need one moment with your feet!
I'm coming!
uh... oh!
you out of your frigging mind, dude?
are you ok?
I don't know what you're saying. What's he saying?
I don't know. I don't speak idiot.
please, allow me...
to see your magnifico feet. - What? No! Ew!
Hey, this is you.
and this one, too. - Let me explain.
my name is Antonio Guiseppe Donatello.
I'm from the village of Nunzio in Italia.
I... Oh, my spleen. It's ok.
two days ago, I have a vision.
I see the face of love, your face.
then I see your neck, your torso, your...
Oh, got it. I get it.
but... I could not paint your feet.
you came all the way from Italy to paint my feet?
no, also to earn your love.
I think you have me confused with someone else.
put some ice on it and be careful.
OK! I will paint your face on every building in this city until you recognize my love!
Hi. I'm kind of in a hurry, so... Thanks.
no problem.
isn't this place the greatest?
you can get your work done, no one bothers you.
food's great. Low carb, high protein.
it's really the only way to go when your work requires you to be shredded and dieseled out.
Oh, yeah, here, don't crane your neck.
go ahead. Feast your eyes. Yes, I've seen that look before.
you're intimidated because I'm a model.
but I don't want you to be scared, ok? I'm a normal guy.
this is my portfolio. It's kind of my calling card.
these are mostly non-paying jobs, or spec work.
I think that's a Real Dog.
and here's the Crown Jewel. I am the Gasee guy. So...
Wow. - I'm Gale.
like a gale-force wind.
I took on that name because it's the most powerful force in the natural world.
for shaping and eroding the earth, it's...
you can feel it.
actually, I think that's water, eroding the earth.
don't think it's water. I think it's wind.
like the Grand Canyon. - I'm gonna look that up.
this is crazy. I don't know whether to look at my own reflection or at you, - that's how beautiful you are. - You know what? I have to go.
OK, you asked for it.
Yeah, she's back. Hi. - You can't just take your shirt off.
I don't hear any complaints from the peanut gallery, so...
put your shirt back on, creep. - Here you go.
I know this looks nuts, all right?
and maybe I am a little nuts because I've never tried to share my beauty with anyone before.
and I think it's because I'm in love with you. Big time.
great first date, Beth!
let's get another one on the books soon.
come on, man, put your shirt on.
honestly though, is there a doctor here, because there's some kind of weird swelling in this...
Yeah, that can't be normal, can it? Humans aren't...
jeez, Louise, dessert's served.
sit down, Gas guy.
Oh, sorry. - Excuse me, miss. Miss?
I believe you dropped this.
Oh, my... Yeah, thank you.
I don't know how that fell off. Thanks.
miss?
how did you?
time flies, but magic flies faster.
Oh, you're a street magician.
I really appreciate it, but I don't have the time right now.
you have all the time in the world.
damn it. All right, now it's getting kind of creepy because you must have just touched me, and I didn't feel anything.
pick a card, and I'll show you my heart.
come on, do it! - Do it!
if I pick a card, will you stop stealing my watch?
probably. - Ok.
take a good look. Don't show it to me.
wasn't gonna. - Place it back in the deck.
ready, everyone? - Wow.
that's not my card.
I know... Because the joker is me.
a fool for love. I told you I'd show you my heart.
EW!
Oh!
is this your card?
get over here. Little help here, please.
Hey, little girl, could you please give me my heart?
is it me, or is New York getting crazier?
your sister's on line two. - Take a message.
she says it's kind of important. - Fine. Patch her through.
Hi, Joan.
what were you doing in the Fontana d'Amore - during my wedding? - What makes you think that...
I'm looking at a picture of you.
it's front-page news over here, sis. What were you thinking?
I don't know. Little bit of jet lag, little bit of champagne, or a lot of champagne.
and the next thing I know, I'm sitting in the fountain picking up coins.
she took coins from the fontana? That's not so good.
why not so good? - There is a legend, if you take someone's coin from the fontana, they will fall in love with you.
Oh! Except that is ridiculous. - Ok. Then we hang up!
I totally believe in magic coins.
were you on that call? - Love is finally at your doorstep.
so have any men come on to you since the wedding?
well... - Oh, my God. They have been.
Yeah, a couple of weirdos approached me this morning...
but... - There are some magical forces at work here.
I don't believe in magic. Know what I do believe in?
art. Where's my Slater Bradley?
told you I was on top of it.
the insurance company totally wanted to jack up the rate, so in an effort to be more assertive, I told them to shove it.
you told Hillman and Craft to shove it?
Yeah. - That piece was coming from a collector in Australia.
even if we got it on a jet today, it would never clear customs in time for the gala.
that means I have no centerpiece for the Circle of Gold.
I'll get Hillman and Craft on the phone. I'll be quick.
I don't think I burned that bridge. - No, no. It's too late now. I...
I have to tell Celeste.
Hello?
Oh, hey. Did I mention Joan gave me your cell number, too?
little busy now. What do you want? - Same thing I wanted last night.
what is it going to take for me to convince you - that I'm not interested in you? - What is it going to take?
Ah, it's going to take you looking me in the eye to tell me that.
that'd require seeing you, and I don't have the time for that right...
Hi. - Oh, so you're stalking me now?
no, I'm just running into you in a premeditated manner.
Nick, I have a big problem on my hands right now.
I just lost the centerpiece to my show.
Beth? - Celeste.
this is Mr Al Russo, our newest patron.
he asked specifically to see you.
um, of course. Um, hi. Um...
I'm sorry. Have we met before? - In my dreams.
Beth has secured a rare Slater Bradley as the centerpiece for our Pain Exhibit.
actually, Celeste...
Nick Beamon? Are you Nick Beamon? - Yeah.
Oh, Nick the Hit! You want to talk about pain, this guy...
a million volts in the neck. - That's fascinating.
Beth, you do have the Slater Bradley, yes?
Celeste, it's... - My fault, and I was meaning to tell you...
actually, she has access to something even better.
this is really not the time, Nick. - An original Petrocelli.
the title of the photograph is Anguish.
and it too has never been viewed in public.
a Petrocelli that's never been viewed?
that's right. Damian Petrocelli himself agreed to give me the print - and burn the negative. - Why would he do that?
because I happen to be the subject of the photo.
and I'm willing to relive that humiliation in public because I know that as long as Beth is involved, it will be in good hands.
how about that private tour we're gonna have?
follow me.
including Cezanne, Degas, Manet, Picasso and Van Gogh...
they're just really nicely spaced.
you did such a great job.
let me... I have something for you. This is a gift for you.
Oh, my.
it's not from Tiffany.
sausage. That's your face. - Yeah, that's it.
I... This may sound a little odd to you, but encased meat is my life's work.
I am like a curator, just like you. A curator of sausage.
well, passion is passion. - That's exactly what I say.
I mean there is not an emotion on earth that can't be expressed through sausage.
and that bratwurst is saying, "hello, and thank you for showing me the museum."
who knew bratwurst could even say all that?
Beth. - Please tell me you're here because you have a deep appreciation for modern art.
I have a deep appreciation, but for you, Beth.
that's it. Tour's over.
I know it seems crazy. It's crazy to me too.
want to play cat and mouse? I can play cat and mouse.
you forgot your sausages!
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm so sorry. - Oh, it hurts.
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that was you. I didn't...
I'm really sorry.
it hurts so bad, but tastes so good.
what is that, mint? - It's breath spray.
you startled me, I didn't have anything else. I am so sorry.
can I see it? Take your hands away.
you're gonna make it worse. - I'm not gonna make it worse.
don't be such a baby. I really feel awful.
I did not know that it would hurt that bad.
it doesn't hurt that bad. I was just playing.
you think you're real charming, don't you?
little bit. - Yeah. Well, you are. Ok?
what? - Ok.
where are you going?
I know your type of guy, Nick.
and what type is that?
come on. The girl in the red dress kissing you at the fountain?
you saw that? - Yeah.
that's why you've been cold the last couple of days.
is that so hard to believe?
that was Umberto's crazy cousin, OK?
you know the blood runs a little hot in that family.
Yeah, you seemed so sick about it.
I was a little sick about it. Especially after I met you.
wait!
Oh, no. Let's go this way.
Hey, Beth! It's me, Al Russo! - Oh, let's cross.
Whoa! Wait one second.
one second! - I'm sorry, Nick! I gotta go!
just... - I'm sorry. I gotta go.
hold on! Beth! Beth, wait.
Ah!
Ah, I did not see that one coming!
OK, Lance, you can do this. Just have to believe.
I will do the Great Mummy Escape, and Beth will love me.
this worked for Houdini, it should work for me.
OK, here she comes.
well, I don't know, Joan. OK? I don't know what I believe anymore.
all I know is that this is crazy, and I need it to stop.
we told you this would happen.
OK, then what is it gonna take for me to end this little nightmare?
you have to return the coins to the Fontana d'Amore.
wait, that's it?
and spell broken, and these guys leave me alone?
I'm overnighting you the coins right now.
that's no good. She needs to return the coins herself.
I cannot just fly back to Italy to put some magic coins into a fountain.
there's got to be another way we can handle this.
try and enjoy the attention? - Joan...
Beth! It's me, Lance.
I'm setting a record for you.
I know this looks scary and dangerous, but if I can do this, get out of the straitjacket...
stop! Stop!
what are you doing in my apartment?
blowing your mind!
no one's ever done the Mummy Escape in under three minutes.
Juan, what's my time? - Three minutes and 53 seconds.
I don't know. That felt pretty tight.
are you sure you timed that right?
you know, you want to find the rabbit, you got to work the hat.
you're just not putting in the hours, bro.
not in front of my girlfriend. - Who the hell is that?
that's Juan, my assistant.
he's just been video chronicling all my illusions. Anyway...
both of you, out of my apartment, now.
no, wait. Now listen up.
Oh, my goodness. Your perfume is intoxicating, and your hair smells like cinnamon!
get out!
Hey, Nick... - Douche.
you get those old giant photos I asked you for?
I am a professional photographer.
I'm not your Girl Friday, ok?
I would appreciate some respect, but yes, here.
or, in lieu of respect, I'd appreciate you and me chatting up two ladies and leaving the one that knows more about Wookiees alone with this.
I'm not gonna be able to make that party.
what? No, Saturday night is the ESPN party.
that's a work and play event, dude. Oh, my God. It's the girl.
the museum girl, isn't it? I knew it. - You don't understand.
you should see this girl. I can barely keep up with her.
she's smart.
she's beautiful. She's funny.
Oh, my God, no. Stop it! Stop liking her!
do not go any further until I can do a little recon on this girl.
recon? What are you, Black Ops? No, absolutely not.
what do you really know about her?
I'm not going to let my boy go in there blind.
puck! No! - No?
No! - No?
no. - How about yes?
OK, go.
Hey! Look at you!
look at me, we look great!
I can't jog. I have a weak hamstring.
it's OK. I nearly die. But I...
robert Longo, Kiki Smith, Carl Riddle...
Mm-hm.
Wow! That looks great!
let's be beautiful together. Where you going? Beth!
it's gonna come back around in four minutes.
it's gonna be great!
I can explain.
there's a nude mural of you on 82nd Street. Should we start there?
I know. That is actually a funny...
could we start somewhere else? - Flowers everywhere!
a sudden, unexplained change in the program for the Circle of Gold gala.
I need to have confidence in my curators, Beth...
you wouldn't believe if...
you're right.
I'm sorry. - You promised me this program - would go off without a hitch. - It will.
let me be perfectly clear. If it doesn't, I'll see to it that the only artwork you're ever allowed near are the velvet Elvis paintings for sale in Times Square.
got it? - Yeah.
this is gonna be a serious blow to your self-esteem.
maybe you should sit down.
remember that girl? The one you wanted to settle down with?
the one you wanted to be little soccer dad with?
well, guess what. Mama's a bigger player than you, son!
shazam! Check it out.
foreign guys, old dudes, Houdini, a half-naked gentleman.
this girl sees more action in one afternoon than you saw in your whole senior season.
look, I'm sorry, man, but it's all there.
it's pretty clear what I have to do.
Yeah.
I got to pick up my game.
Ow!
I was just thinking about you. - I was just thinking of you.
I'm sorry I ran off the other day.
I've just been having one of those weeks.
Yeah, so it would seem. Is everything OK?
Yeah, there's a lot I would like to tell you.
unfortunately, I need to cut to the chase. Back her up a bit.
my fundraiser at the museum, it's tomorrow, - and I need to get my hands on that... - The Petrocelli.
I'm kind of wavering on that now.
but that's the centerpiece to my pain exhibit.
Yeah, but have you thought at all about my pain, my suffering?
what? - I would feel better about it if we could sit down, talk about it, maybe over dinner?
I know this place called Blackout on Bleecker.
I was thinking 8：00? - So you're blackmailing me now?
actually, it's extortion. - If I come to dinner, - can I have my Petrocelli? - I got to run. See you at 8: 00!
you have a date, huh? - It's not a date.
so, what are you gonna wear?
my navy blouse, a pencil skirt, and some open-toed slingbacks.
Hey. - Hey.
Wow. You look great.
Oh, I didn't really have time to get ready. Um...
so this is it?
Yeah. It's supposed to get a lot better in the back.
OK. - Look, we got off on the wrong foot.
actually, we got off on the right foot, and Umberto's cousin messed everything...
I don't even want to talk about that right now.
I just wanted to tell you ever since that night in Rome...
Hi! My name is Ilona, and I'll be your sensory guide this evening.
tonight you will enjoy a delicious gourmet meal without your primary sense of sight.
in this way your other senses will become heightened to bring you an exciting, new culinary experience.
is she serious?
Yeah. Our last great moment was the night the lights went out in Rome, so I figured we'd pick up where we left off.
that's beautiful. Please take my hand and I will lead you to your table.
let's make a train.
here we are. Now, just follow me. Stay close.
just let your eyes take a back seat while your senses do the driving.
it's furniture.
that's a chair. Very good. Very good.
you wouldn't have gotten to feel that chair if your eyes...
Oh, my. Oh, my!
I'm so sorry. I am so sorry. - What an adventure.
all right. That's a head. That's a man's head.
there are so many people! - I think I broke something.
just keep coming forward. That's a woman, sir.
sorry. - All right.
here's your table. Now follow my voice to the chair.
follow my voice to the chair. - Right here?
Where's my voice? Your butt should go about here.
I know you can't see this, but you've got a gentleman.
let me help you with your jacket.
it's a struggle because of your muscles. Jeez!
Yeah. - And here we are.
are you smelling me?
OK. So, in just a few minutes, your wine will be out.
if you need anything at all, just raise your hand, and one of our attendants will assist you.
remember, you can't see us, but we can see you.
this is... This is kind of...
kind of cool. - Creepy.
it's awesome! - I thought you had left.
your wine is being poured in front of you at two o'clock. Enjoy.
there you go.
I hope you didn't order anything expensive.
she could have switched it to a cheap bottle and we'd have no way of knowing.
still here. And I would never do that, ever.
you going to be there the whole meal, or...
no. I'm going to let the two of you get to know each other on a deeper level, and I'm going to go touch other people in the restaurant.
OK, then. Thank you. - Sure.
I think she's finally gone. It's really dark.
I'll tell you this. Even in the dark you're beautiful.
this is actually kind of nice.
this is the best I've felt since Rome.
Beth, it's me! Al Russo.
I've been looking all over for you. - Who's this?
your liverwurst nightmare, pal. - Oh, no.
Ah, the feet...
look who it is, principessa.
meatball! - Sausage king!
does anyone have... the time?
Oh, God. - Hey, my watch is missing.
try being gorgeous, and no one can see you.
who is that? - Waiter?
feel like I'm driving a Lamborghini around with a car cover on.
ordered an eight-pack? Please enjoy.
Nick, I had a great time, but I got to go!
"great time?" We just got here! Beth, wait. Beth...
Ow!
ma'am! - What the hell is going on?
people really drop a lot of food in this place.
are you dark dining and dashing?
I had her, and you blew it.
he make her disappear with magic.
bring her back, warlock!
Taxi!
Beth! - Please, just let me go.
do you mind telling me what the hell just happened there?
how many guys are you seeing? - I'm not see...
you don't... Those guys don't know me.
they're just under a... spell.
Beth! Beth, hi!
why don't you leave me alone! I don't know you!
Beth, it's me. Your dentist. Dr. Moscowitz.
Oh.
sorry, Dr. Moscowitz. Hi. - Everything OK?
Oh, God, yeah.
and I'm flossing twice a day. - Oh, good.
I don't want to talk about it. - Your dentist? Are you Ok?
I just want to get out of here.
OK.
where do you want to go? - I don't...
where would you feel safe?
I used to come here with my parents when I was a little girl.
I thought this place was magic.
and my father told me that the roof was made of glass so that God could see the paintings from up in heaven.
Wow.
I know.
her name was Marie-Therese Walter.
she was 17 when Picasso fell in love with her.
Picasso was already married, and 30 years her senior, so they kept their affair a secret.
but he documented his passion by hiding her initials in some of his paintings.
of course, Picasso wasn't completely ready to settle down, and he left Marie-Therese for Dora Maar just like he left his wife Olga for Marie-Therese.
but Marie-Therese never stopped loving Picasso.
and she hung herself after his death.
hey...
you OK?
she just loved him so much, and in the end, he didn't really love her back.
it's just sad.
you know, it doesn't always have to be that way.
every time I've ever put myself out there, I've gotten hurt.
every time.
it's like I meet a guy, and I think it's great.
and anyone else would just be thinking about how much greater it's going to get.
and I'm constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.
you know, lightning does strike once in a while, Beth.
trust me. I know.
I wish I could believe that.
you can. No other shoes are going to drop, Beth.
this is real.
I'm real.
damn it! - It's OK.
it's OK. - One second.
six beers enter, no beers leave!
what are you doing? Come on.
is she here? What's her name? Betsy?
I hate you. You're ruining my life.
aha, you found it. - Oh, it's so beautiful.
and so sad. - Yeah, it's OK.
you know, every time I look at that, all I think about is...
everything football meant to me and my family and especially my old man.
all the dreams... gone in an instant.
that was the real hit.
Oh, no.
what? - I have to go.
what's wrong? We can slow down.
I just have to go. - Hold on, hold on.
hold on. Hey!
I don't get it. - I know you don't, Nick.
and you probably never will.
but it's not real. And it's never going to be real.
what about the photograph?
keep it.
I don't want to see you in pain.
is this all the programs? I don't want to forget any.
everything's gonna be Ok, Beth. I know it will.
no, it's not.
it's his chip. He's just under a spell. It's not real.
hello. - Listen, I have great news.
umberto talked to his nana.
she said there's another way to break the spell.
there is? - Yeah.
all you have to do is return the coins directly to the guys.
it doesn't have to be the fountain.
return the coin, return the love.
if I return the coins, I return the love?
Yeah.
that'll break the spell?
and that'll get me out of this whole mess?
Yeah! It'll be all over. Isn't that great?
Yeah. It's great. - I knew you'd be relieved.
this is for your own good, boss.
it's exactly what I wanted.
Yeah! Oh, I got to go. Good luck at the show tonight.
I'll call you later.
I love you, OK? Bye! - Ok.
Hey, boss, I'm gonna start setting up. I'll see you at the Gugg.
Wow.
come on in.
OK.
it's nice here. Very nice.
I like what you do. It's sort of modern.
very nice place. - Beautiful.
really nice. You look great. Are you excited for the show?
you OK? You seem sad.
this is going to be harder than I thought. Um...
I'm actually glad that you're all here.
just because I need to tell you something.
Oh.
come here.
the couch. You can sit on the couch.
you're gonna tell us on the couch? - Yeah.
I think she's gonna pick one of us.
like The Bachelor. I love this show, with the rose.
I like my odds. - It's you, it's you.
um...
I don't know any other way to say this, other than to just...
you don't love me.
trust me, I love you. - No, you don't.
they don't, but I do. - I love you so much.
well, I was drunk, but I took the coins. I took your coins.
I do love you. - It's not real. You don't love me.
as much as I can love someone. - No, you don't.
we're not in love with each other. I'm in love with someone else. I love Nick.
I love Nick.
I love Nick more than I love my job, which is big for me.
and it's not your fault, and I'm really sorry.
I love him even if he might not love me back.
you know?
I understand loving somebody and...
them not loving you back.
we all do.
it's a bummer. - This really suck.
I'm sorry, guys.
OK...
the whole point of love is to put someone else's needs above your own.
maybe that's why I'm here. Maybe that's why we're all here.
maybe for you.
he may be on to something. - No, it's true.
how can we help? - Thanks, guys.
and this will all be a little clearer when I give you something back.
Oh, no.
Stacy.
what the heck is? - What?
that was weird. - I swear, that wasn't me.
it was just...
freak electrical storm has caused rolling blackouts and gridlock throughout the city. Traffic lights are out throughout the metro area.
new York City is at a standstill.
we got to stay in. - I make food for everybody. We eat.
no, no, no. We're not staying here. You're not staying here.
I need to be at the Guggenheim. This has to end now.
after we eat.
hold it, hold it.
if we love her, we'll get her to the Guggenheim. That's all there is to it.
let's do this.
I'll do it. And I'm going to do it with more flair than all of you.
we take my car. I just bring her from Italia.
you have a car? - It's molto grande.
for one, two... No, it be fine.
come on! Move it!
comfortable up there? - Where's the keys?
I had the keys in your apartment.
have the key. - Give him the keys.
Ay-yay-yay!
I am what I am. - Annoying.
who makes this car, Fisher-Price?
in Italia this is a midsize car.
in America it's a clown car.
careful.
it's Stacy. Leave a message. - Stacy, please call me when you get this.
and don't do anything with those coins. I'm on my way.
I was expecting a little bit bigger. - Oh, tiny bit, huh?
hit the horn. Thread the needle. See if you can go around this guy.
just drive like you're in Rome. - No problem.
Hey, coming through!
I'm OK.
if you can't reach the dashboard, and you wanna hold onto the washboards, let me know.
there's a fat guy on a bike. A fat guy on a bike.
sorry about that.
I'll give you a thousand bucks to let me sit in front.
OK, that hurt. - Damn it!
come on up.
there's the Gugg!
coming through!
you can just let me out here. - No, it's not close enough.
I take you right upstairs.
no, Antonio. The doors! - I got this. You must all believe.
I don't believe! - I don't believe!
I believe!
open!
I did it!
could you push five?
Stacy.
Beth. There you are. You're a hit. They love the show.
the Petrocelli is... How?
Nick sent it over late this afternoon. People cried when they saw it.
and Celeste is... - Pleased.
we've already received a record number of financial pledges tonight, Beth.
I'm very proud of you. You're a wonderful curator.
anyone who would care to join me in the Thannhauser, please come this way.
Stacy... I need the coins.
but look at what's happened, Beth. Nick did all of this for you.
he loves you. - I know.
but if I take his love against his will, that's not love at all.
please, Stacy. The coins. I have to do this my way.
you are not going to the Guggenheim.
this isn't my scene.
what are you talking about? We're neck-deep in hot ladies.
lt is here. What up, son?
LT! - Man, what's your damn problem?
he knows his name. Where are you going?
Hey, how's it going? We're from the network.
good to see you. We're big fans. We read your column every week.
thank you.
somebody we wanted to introduce you to. Nick, Shaq.
how you doing? Read your article. - Oh. Yeah?
spelled my name wrong. - It's the proofreading department.
this guy right here? - Yeah, this guy.
no, not me.
excuse me, I've got to take this phone call.
you don't know how to spell? - I don't know anything.
Beth. Hey, how are you?
Nick, there's something I want to tell you.
even though it won't matter after tonight.
I want to thank you... for making me believe in love again.
even if it wasn't real for you, it was very real for me.
what does that mean?
Beth. Beth!
Hey!
I'm guessing this belongs to you?
does it?
check your purse.
OK, stop it. I need you to take this.
come on. Close your hand.
wait, I have another trick. - Nope.
now I remember.
I never had the guts to perform in public until I wanted to do it for you. I guess I just needed a muse.
what am I going to do without you?
you'll find your muse. Your true muse.
trust me, you won't be sorry.
are you a coin collector?
when I threw this coin in the fountain
I wasn't wishing that my wife would come back.
I knew that wouldn't happen.
I was just wishing to get a chance to feel the way I did when she was around.
and...
my wish came true. You gave me that.
thank you.
Hey!
Oh, come on!
is this your euro?
that's weird. - Antonio?
it's Anthony, actually. - From Nunzio?
no. Newark. New Jersey. - Are you really a tortured artist?
tortured. Been in retail shoe sales for the last nine years.
as far as being an artist, I guess I figured going to Italy'd make me one.
I think you're an artist.
I do. And I'm not just saying that because I'm trying to get rid of you.
it's my professional opinion. - Thank you.
I think I'll miss you least of all.
honestly, I don't think I really learned anything.
no? - But man, I had a blast helping you grow.
you're welcome.
Mmm.
good luck. It's all right.
what's going on here? - All the lights are out.
some kind of freak electrical storm.
I wouldn't cross there if I were you! That's suicide, pal!
crap, not again.
Oh, I didn't see that one coming.
that was both our faults, really. - What are you doing here?
come on, you didn't think I was going to let my boy do this alone, did you?
Oh, I feel safer. Thank you. - Does she have a sister?
she's married. - Dammit.
come on. Get in.
you know, you're buying me a new windshield, right?
don't kick my car. I'll hit you again! - Yeah, I'm Ok, by the way.
I'm fine. Don't worry about me. - Good. I don't care.
and I guess there's one more.
looking for something?
I need that.
Oopsie-daisy, where'd it go?
Oh, there they are.
now, there's two.
back to one. - Give it to me!
so, I guess it's over now, huh?
is that really what you want? - It doesn't matter what I want.
you've got your will back.
ever since I saw you in that fountain something...
something changed in me. I can't eat. I can't sleep.
I can't do anything without thinking about you.
I don't know what is going on with me, Beth but I want to know what is going on with you.
you seem to think that all these guys are under some kind of crazy spell or something, and that I'm one of them, but I'm not. This is real, OK?
and I ran all the way up Fifth Avenue in a lightning storm - because I wanted to tell you... - You love me?
I never said I loved you. - You didn't. No, you don't.
no, no, no, I just never said it.
you said it, and I wanted to say it, but...
OK, you go. You say it. Oh, well, say it if you want to say it.
look...
the only spell that I'm under...
is yours.
I'm in love with you, Beth.
Oh. Did she invite you, too? - Yeah. Tony.
gale. - Yeah.
nice to see you. - Yeah. You, too.
you look great. That's a nice cut.
you look terrific.
beautiful silhouette. I saw you out there.
you can hold a suit. Yeah.
you're an artist. - Yeah. Sort of.
I would love to do a nude with you.
I'd like that.
great.
I'd really like that.
I am really sorry about this, Beth. This is all my fault.
I found that in my bag of tricks.
it's not mine, so... - Oh, my God. It's Nick's.
I guess I accidentally gave you the wrong chip in the museum.
he's still under the spell.
OK, thank you. Time to go. - Are you her sister?
well, would you like to see an illusion? - Bye-bye.
don't you want to be dazzled?
Oh, my God, Beth. I'm so sorry. - What am I going to do?
showtime.
dad.
when you married Mom, did you ever think that you wouldn't make it?
Elizabeth Ann.
honey, you cannot learn from my mistakes.
you're gonna have to go out there and make your own.
now, you could get your heart broken or you could have the greatest love affair the world has ever known, but you're not gonna know unless you try.
but what if there was a guarantee that you'd never get hurt.
baby... The passion is in the risk.
it's like I always say, "if you're going to be a bear...
be a grizzly." - That's my girl.
a marriage is like all contracts that the two enter under the eyes of Our Father Almighty.
if there's anybody here who has reasons that Beth...
and Nicholas should not get married today, speak now or forever hold on to your peaces.
anybody?
anybody?
anybody?
it could be anybody. You don't have to know them to speak up.
OK, padre, it seems nobody's objecting, so let's move on with it.
do you, Nicholas, take Beth to be your awful wedded wife?
"Lawful." Yes. Yes, I do.
what is with him?
and do you, Beth, take Nicholas to be your awful wedded husband?
to love, amore, to honor until morte, death, do you part?
think, bella. It's a very big responsibility, no?
no.
I can't do this to you, Nick. I'm sorry.
you think you're pretty funny, don't you?
did you enjoy watching me go crazy?
did you have fun watching my life turn upside down because of love?
because I did.
Beth!
Beth!
I've got a question.
why do you keep giving me my poker chips?
because you deserve to have it back.
you threw it in the fountain and wished for love, and I don't want to keep it anymore.
no, I didn't. - You didn't?
no. - Then who did?
I have no idea.
then this is all real?
how's this for real?
free of temptation!
didn't you say at Umberto's bachelor party...
the padre cleaned me out at the poker table. Yeah.
- I'm fine.
only 5 bucks, man.
I'll give you $3.
sir!
take good care of her. I'll be back in a month.
thank you, sir.
drop. Three.
drop. Two.
drop. Four. - All pins down.
preparing to open.
3-2-4. Wait!
you okay?
what happened?
I said wait. You didn't wait.
10, 000 man-hours to get his close to the dutchman, and you blow upmy evidence.
agent burke, how did you knowit was gonna do that?
look at your phones.
what's it spell?
FBI.- Yeah --FBI.
apparently, he knew we were coming.
you think so, copernicus?
somebody want to tell me what this is? Huh? Anybody?
nobody knows what it is? Great.
look at you.
how many of you went to harvard?
don't raise your hands. Don't.
Ah, diana. Look at this.
apparently, our boy has a sense of humor.
what?
Neal caffrey escaped.
what's this?
u. S. Marshalsare requesting your help.
my help? - Director thompsonasked for you personally.
me? Why would he want me?
probably because you're the onlyone who ever caught him.
agent burke.
I'm thompson, U.S. Marshals.
appreciate the help. You were the case agent. - Yes, I was.
so you'll agree that this is an unusual situation.
why would neal run with three months left on a four-year sentence?
that's what we're wondering.
this is warden haskley.
agent burke, FBI.
you're the guy who dropped the ball.
you, of all people, should know what neal caffrey's capable of.
I know I spent three years of my life chasing him and you let him walk out the front door.
gentlemen, might I remind you that caffrey has a four-hour head start?
Caffrey came out of the e-block staff bathroom dressed as a guard.
Where'd he get the uniform? - Uniform supply company on the internet.
he used a credit card?
he used my wife's american express.
we're tracing the number in case he uses it again.
he won'T.
Hey, pretty boy!
how did he get the key cards for the gate?
we think he restriped a utility card, using the record head on that.
you should have given him a CD player.
he walked out the front door, hot-wired a maintenance truck in the parking lot.
we found it abandoned near the airport.
we beefed up security just in case he tries to get out that way.
we're not gonna catch caffrey using roadblocks and wanted posters.
he shaved his beard just before he escaped.
Neal doesn't have a beard.
the inmates are photographed each morning as they exit their cells.
I hardly recognize him.
thompson: I think that's the point.
this morning? - Yes.
run the series back.
stop.
that's it -- when he stopped shaving.
I want to know everythingthat happened that day.
he had a visitor.
Kate moreau. Know her?
Yeah. I do.
no audio? - No.
she comes back every week like clockwork.
she's not thrilledabout this visit.
how soon can we geta lip-reader in here?
I'll save you the trouble.
Adios, neal. It's been real." Did she come back next week?
she never came back.
okay. Let's find kate.
I see kate moved out.
she leave you a messagein that?
the bottle is the message.
it's been a while.
Yeah.
a few years, give or take.
you carrying?
you knowI don't like guns.
they ask me, what makes a guy like you pull a boneheaded escape with four months to go?
I guessyou figured it out.
Kate says "adios" to youat prison, then gets busywith her disappearing act.
her trail ends here.
but you already know that.
I missed her by two days.
still... it only took you a monthand a half to escape a supermax.
damn impressive.
all clear. Subject identifiedand unarmed. - Roger that.
are we surrounded? How many?
including my agentsand the marshals?
all of them, I think.
what's the message?
goodbye.
women.
they're gonna give you another four years for this, you know.
I don't care.
that's the same suit you were wearing the last time you arrested me.
classics nevergo out of style.
you know what this is?
no idea.
I got it from a caseI was supposed to be working on before they yanked me offto find you.
you thinkyou'll catch him?
don't know.
he's good.
maybe as good as you.
what's it worthif I tell you what this is?
is it worth a meeting? - What are you talking about?
if I tell you what this isright now, will you agree to meet meback in prison in one week?
just a meeting. - Okay.
it's a security fiberfor the new canadian $100 bill.
put your handswhere I can see them.
let's go. - One week.
got him.
what's got the belt-and-suspender boys all riled up?
you. - Me? What'd I do?
Caffrey was right.
that stufffrom the bank vault -- security fibersfor the new canadian 100.
I'll be damned. - Apparently, the formulationis still classified.
the canadiansecret service is very curious to knowhow you figured it out.
this should be fun. - You may have startedan international incident.
how did you know? Come on, peter.
it's what I do.
how upsetwere the canadians?
Oh, very.
well, as upsetas canadians can get.
all right, so, I agreed to a meeting. We're meeting.
I know why you call him"the dutchman.
like the ghost ship, he disappears whenever you get close.
how do you know anythingabout him?
you know my life. You don't think I know yours?
did you getthe birthday cards? - Nice touch.
you've beenafter the dutchman almost as longas you were after me.
I'll help you catch him.
Really? Really? How -- how does that work?
you want to beprison pen pals?
you canget me out of here.
there's case law, precedent.
I can be released into your custody.
nice. This is --this is very nice.
but you're right -- I do know you.
and I know the second you're out, you'll take off after kate.
Peter...I am not gonna run.
GPS tracking anklet.
the new ones are tamper-proof, never been skipped on.
there's alwaysa first time.
think about it.
sorry, neal. Nice try.
lights out, bobby. Shut 'em down.
Neal, yo u got toturn that off.
Caffrey: Get one more minute, bobby?
okay, one more minute.
is it midnight yet?
Yeah, it's midnight.
shut up, bitch!
you coming to bed tonight?
Yeah.
what's wrong?
nothing.
Oh, don't tell meit's neal caffrey.
I've been competing with himfor three years.
he'd be out today.
you considering his offer?
of course you are, or you'd be in bed with me.
can he help youfind him?
Neal's smart.
you know how muchI like smart.
is he as smart as those ivy league co-edsthey throw at you?
he's almost as brilliantas the woman I married.
Ooh, good answer.
so, what's the problem?
this is not the wayit's supposed to go.
you get caught, you do your time.
there's more to this -- more to thisthan some lost love.
some side anglehe's playing.
so you're suggesting he escapesa maximum-security prison, knowing full wellthat you'd catch him, just so he could trick youinto letting him out again?
it's a working theory. - Yeah. Keep working.
is it so hardfor you to believe a man would do thatfor the woman he loves?
Neal just bought himselffour more years in prison. For what?
for what?
if you were neal, you wouldn't have run for me?
let me see it.
you understandhow this works?
Yeah, I'm being releasedinto the custody of the fbi under your supervision.
I let this thingchafe my leg. Anything I'm missing?
you're back herefor good.
you're gonna be temptedto look for kate. Don'T.
I told you --the bottle meant goodbye.
then leave it at that.
this isa temporary situation.
help me catch the dutchman, we can make it permanent.
where are we headed?
your new home.
this is neal caffrey. My office called earlier.
there you go...snake eyes.
thank you.
can I talk to youfor a second?
hang on. A little farther down.
do I have to stay here?
cowboy up, all right?
it cost $700 a monthto house you on the inside, so that'swhat it costs here.
for the money, this is as good as it gets.
you find something better, take it.
what about clothes? I'm wearing my entire wardrobe.
you like thrift stores.
there's oneat the end of the block.
no, don't start. No protests. This is what you wanted, isn't it? Huh?
look it. It's ni--oh, look at her.
you don't get that in prison, do you? No, not at all.
listen, your tracking ankletis set up so that you can go anywherewithin 2 miles of this place.
here's your homework.
remember -- 2 miles.
I'll see youat 7: 00 A. M.
I've come to donate these.
men's suits.
those are fantastic.
they belonged to my late husband -- byron.
he really did have great taste in clothes.
may I? Thank you.
this is a devore.
Yes. He won it from sy himself.
won it? - He beat him at a backdoor draw.
your husband played poker with sy devore?
he certainly did. And so did I.
no. - Yes.
the guys would even let me sitin once in a while on a hand.
and I was good.
I' m glad to seeyou appreciate these.
I was hopingsomeone would.
I've got a whole closetfull of them.
a whole closet?
well, actually, it's a guest room, but, uh, but I haven't used it for anything except storage for years.
Byron used to wear that one whenever we went dancing.
the neighborhoodwas... let's say it was much nicer then.
you live nearby?
not far.
I'm here for caffrey, room 11.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
snake eyes.
nice guy.
left you a note.
you've got to be kidding me.
good day.
thank you.
I think I havethe wrong address.
you must be peter.
I'm looking for neal caffrey.
he's upstairs.
you're early. - We're shagging a lead at the airport.
we got a hiton "snow white.
snow white.
the phrase you decoded from a suspected dutchman communiqu? to barcelona.
you moved.
Yeah. It's nicer than the other place, don't you think?
Yeah. I don't remember the other place having a view.
I went to the thrift store, like you suggested.
and june... - lady with the dog. We met.
...was donatingher late husband's clothes.
we hit it off. She had an extra guest room.
you said if I found a nicerplace for the same price, I should take it.
I did say that.
all this for $700?
Yep. But I help outaround the place.
Oh, sure. Feed the dog.
Yeah. Wash the jag.
watch her granddaughter from time to time.
she's got you babysitting?
how's it going?
morning, neal.
granddaughter? - She's an art student.
unbelievable.
go get dressed.
you mind?
Hey, grandma.
good morning, cindy.
it's perfect.
even the freakin' coffeeis perfect.
that's not jewelry on his ankle, you know.
he's a felon.
so was byron.
you look likea cartoon.
this is classic rat pack. This is a devore.
sorry, dino.
will you stop with the hat?
come on. Let's go.
you're upset.
sour grapes. - What was that?
look, you tell me which rule I broke, and I will thumb itback to prison myself.
for starters...mm-hmm?
I work hard. I do my job well.
and I don't havea $10 million view of manhattan that I share with a 22-year-old art student while we sip espres so.
why not?
why not?
because I'm not supposed to.
the amount of work I do equals certain thingsin the real world.
not cappuccinoin the clouds.
look, I will find out where june buys her coffee if it's that important to you.
it's not about the coffee. - I think it is.
no, it's not.
this is what gets you into trouble.
this is the start of those something-for-nothing schemes that lead to the frauds that got you locked up.
I think it's some sortof Italian roast.
get in the car.
okay. Who's that? - That's diana.
Diana is my probie.
probie? - Probationary agent.
she does everythingI don'T.
she's very goodat her job, and she can do way better than you.
you must beneal caffrey.
nice hat.
what have we got? - His name's tony field.
customs flagged him coming in from spain in response to our snow white bolo.
customs playing nice?
the usual chest-pounding --he's in their custody, not ours.
less paperwork for me. What's he carrying?
Oh, you're gonna love this.
snow white and her seven little men.
this is what triggered our alert?
what do we know about this guy?
says he'sa rare-book dealer.
anything wrong with his paperwork?
no. He brought in the same books in the same quantityon three previous trips.
he declared them each time.
all right, dino. Are we wasting our time?
they're not limited runsor special editions. Can't be worth much.
so why go to all the trouble of flying them in?
good question. - He sure is nervous for having all the right paperwork.
I want to talk to him. - I'll set it up.
Hey, boss, I'm grabbing some coffee. You want some?
Yeah. Anything but decaf.
Diana, I'll take mine straight.
Neal, the coffee shop's outside.
you are way out of your league.
Oh, harmless flirting. It's like a dance.
Ah, there is no dance.
you're not evenon her dance card.
no dancing for you.
um, she digs the hat.
um, she'd rather be wearing the hat.
Oh, they're really kicking it up a notch.
so, you're a book dealer.
Yes. Well, as I have told everyone here, repeatedly, my business is the importand sale of rare books.
how rare can they be? You've got 600 of them.
would you like me to goto the crime lab?
help you dust for fingerprints?
I get it.'Cause I'm telling you how to do your job.
So,"snow white" --in spanish?
snow white was not created by disney, detective.
there are a few storiesthat predate "steamboat willie.
I'm a federal agent.
and you mean folklore of the virginally pure queen?
like alexander pushkin's "tale of the white princess and the seven knights"?
is thatwhat you mean?
what are the books for?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk to my client.
constitution and all.
were you chasing the ambulance, or did they give you a ride?
huh? You must have thumbed it.
no dance, huh?
not for you.
I thought the FBI had a policy.
that's the military. We don't ask. We don't care.
Where'sthe customs inspector?
Neal was right. The books aren't worth much.
you could pick them upfor a few dollars on ebay.
Hey, why didn't you tell methe guy lawyered up?
the second he makes that call, I can't talk to him.
he didn't call anybody.
then how did his lawyerknow that
I need paramedics in here now!
nobody friskedthe lawyer?!
God!
we've got a dead book dealer, a killer lawyer, and a bunchof worthless books.
all right. Come on.
as a reformed professional counterfeiter, what is the dutchman's interest in these?
published 1944in madrid.
this iswhat he's after.
the top sheet?
more than that. This is a pieceof 1944 spanish press parchment.
that's what he wanted. - Good. This is good.
he's gonna counterfeit something that was originally printedon paper like that?
that's what i would do.
Tony made three prior shipments with these.
two blank pages per bookis 600 sheets.
too many for paintings, not enough for currency.
I bet our deadbook dealer knew.
Diana, where's that wallet?
it's right here.
this is where he went the day before he left for spain.
Yeah, I do remember him.
he came by several months ago and then again last week.
this is what he came to see.
the spanish victory bond.
he took several photographsof it.
said he was gonna write a book. It's a shame he's dead.
this bond does havea fascinating history.
it's a goya.
Yes. Beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, look at that.
a perfect fit.
you're starting to earn your $700 a month.
you said it had a fascinating history.
quite. It was is sued during the war.
1944. - Yes.
Yeah, the U. S. Issued it to support the spanish underground in their battle against the axis.
very few have ever been redeemed.
there's speculation that entire boxes were captured and many of them are still hidden away inthe caves of altamira.
whole boxes of these?
Yeah.
boy, that would be something, wouldn't it?
this is the only surviving copy.
except it's a forgery.
no. That's not possible.
what are you talking about?
it's the ink. This is iron-gal dyemixed to match period colors, but it hasn't dried yet.
you can still smell the gum arabic.
uh, no. This has been here since 1952.
it's been here less than a week.
okay. Tony makes two trips.
the first time, he takes a picture of the bond.
his second trip in, he steals the original and replaces it with this copy.
can we confirm that?
the time dink-identification test puts the age of the bondat approximately six days, which coincideswith tony's visit.
we're pulling surveillance video to back it up.
good. So the question is, why go to the trouble of making a really nice forgery, on the right kind of paper, just to stick it back in the archives?
Caffrey: Is the bond still negotiable?
it's a zero option, so it never expires.
what's it worth?$1, 000 face value.
drawing 9% interest.
compounded for 64 years.
248000
what he said.
quarter of a million. Not chump change.
and he's got 600 sheets of the stuff.
$150 million --give or take.
he'd be a rich manif he could pass them off.
but it still doesn't tell us why he would take out the real bond and put in a forgery.
I think it does.
what if he claimed he found boxes of the original bonds?
dragged them out of those cavesin spain.
Yeah. How would they be authenticated?
they'd be taken to the archivesand compared to the original.
which he's already switched out with one of his own copies.
so of course they're gonna match.
Oh, this is good. This is really good.
all right. Let's think about this.
it's elizabeth.
would you believe me if I said I was pulling up right in front of the house now?
you lost track of time. It happens.
I hopeyou didn't make dinner.
did you forget who you married?
I am smarter than that.
so, how's neal doing? Satchmo.
he met diana.
Oh, a woman who can resist his charms.
bet that's taking some getting used to. Is he helping?
we're onto something here, el.
so I won't wait up.
I'm leaving. 10 minutes --I promise.
20 at the most.
I know.
Bye.
chew your food.
you sound like your father.
big plans for the weekend?
uh, you know, I got tofix the sink, catch the game.
with elizabeth?
Yeah. Yeah, she's into it.
how cool is that?
she likes to watch the giants.
even on your anniversary?
I see this stuff comingfrom six months out, and then I take it right in the teeth every time.
relax, man. You still have a few days.
no. This is what happened last year.
I said I'd make up for it with something special, not just a corner boothat donatella'S...
...and a romp in the sheets.
skip the dinner. - We've been married a decade.
that doesn't cut it anymore.
okay, romeo, let's -- let's problem-solve.
what's she into?
sexually?
no. No. Existentially.
what makes her feel alive?
I'm drawing a blank.
how could you not know?
when you were chasing me, you knew my shoe size, what timeI woke up in the morning.
that's the job. Very different. - So, a relationship isn't work?
Oh, no, no. You don't get to lecture me on relationships.
my wife didn't change heridentity and flee the country to get away from me.
Yes, yes, yes.
that was harsh. I didn't -- I didn't mean that.
Yeah, you did. Did she really flee the country?
I don't know. - France? Did she go to france?
I don't know.
what am I gonna do? - No.
no more relationship advice from this side of the car.
call dr. Phil, okay?
I saw the best mind of my generation get run down by the drunken taxicab of absolute reality.
what the hell, mozzie?
sitting in the dark, misquoting ginsberg?
the light' show they find you, man.
Hey, you know, you can't just help yourself here.
how'd you get in? - I used this.
I knocked.
I introduced myself to june. She's great.
did you get a load of that granddaughter?
thanks for coming.- What was I gonna do --not come?
can I see?
can you pick it?
no way. No way.
you flew too close to the sun, my friend.
they burned your wings.
Where's kate, moz?
Where'd she go?
she's a ghost, man.
she did an outstanding job of melting away.
well, keep looking.
check france. - France?
I know, okay? It's probably nothing.
Just...look everywhere.
there's something else.
I need you to help me figure out who created...this.
it's superb.
you know the worst thing about art forgery?
you can't take creditf or your work.
honey?
what do you like?
what's special?
look at you. You haven't changed.
yeah? This is burke.
it's jones. Caffrey's anklet activated. Is he with you?
no. I'm coming.
el, I've got to go. - Neal's outside his radius agent burke, are you still there?
Caffrey is with me.
are you sure? - Yeah, yeah.
good morning, honey.
you're on my couch? - Yeah, I came to talk to you.
and, uh, frankly, peter, I have to say I'm surprised you have such an amazing wife.
Yeah, I like her. Get off my couch.
honey, we're just chatting. - Chatting?
how did you get here?
cab. - You activated your tracker.
you're in my house on my couch with my wife.
Oh, hey, satchmo.
now you're petting my dog.
did you really put elizabet hunder surveillance before you asked her out?
Peter, I underestimated you. - You told him?
he said he wanted to make sure that I wasn't seeing anybody else.
honey, I think it's cute.
I think it's adorable. - I'm putting you back in prison.
I know who the dutchman is.
enlighten me.
he's an art restorer -- one of the best in the world, but his own work never took off.
he's particularly good at goya restorations.
that's what this is, peter. The bond is him showing off.
interesting theory. How do you prove it? - He signed it.
I think we might have noticed a signature tucked in the corner.
show him.
look at the pantson the spanish peasant.
what do you see?
it's the initials"c" and "H."
I don't know. That's -- that's a stretch.
this bondis a masterpiece.
if I'd done something this good, I would have signed it.
the forgeries you caught me on, I signed them.
where?
look at the bank sealunder polarized light sometime.
Hagen is doing a church restoration on third street. We can stop by on our way in.
fine.
meet me in the car.
I'm gonna say goodbye to my wife now. - Yes.
it was nice to meet you.
nice to meet you after all these years.
this is it? - Yep.
you can't come in. We're closed for restoration.
sorry, father.
could we just -- could we just have a moment? Thank you.
father...
please, father. My best friend is having a crisis of the soul.
he's a married man.
and he has the most devastatingly beautiful assistant at work --a very provocative woman.
he's been tempted.
more than tempted. I have details.
it's very common with men his age.
unfortunately, very common.
and I-I want to confront him about this before he tears aparthis life.
he has a lot of faults.
I mean, don't get me started. He is a mess.
but he's very spiritual.
I knowthis is the place where my words will have the most effect.
this is the city of churches.
we're closed. Surely, there's another place.
this is where he was married.
five minutes. - Oh, thank you. Thank you, father.
sorry about that. We got five.
did you just lie to a priest?
do you think diana's attractive?
sure. - Then we're good.
extraordinary. - Real nice.
so, if this hagen...guy is as good as you say...
how come I've never heard of him?
you only know the guys who get caught.
you know the second-best criminals.
what's that say about you?
it says there's an exception to every rule.
look --"c" and "H."
where?
right here.
right there.
C. H. - Maybe.
what do you mean, maybe? That's a "c" and an "H."
can I help you, gentlemen?
your face --it's familiar.
maybe I've seen it on the news or perhaps on a "most wanted" webpage?
forgive me if I don't shake hands with an art thief.
I was never arrested for art theft.
not arrested, but, as I recall, you're known as quite the renaissance criminal.
so you can understand my concern at having you in my space.
and you are...?
just a friend.
well, friend...this church is closed.
did you see it? - Okay, you've got me curious.
we'll check him out.
listen to the spirit, son, not the flesh.
I'll do that.
What'S...that about?
shut the door.
I need your help with this.
is this the informationon hagen?
no. - Diana's on her way with that.
this is your wife's visa bill.
Yeah. I got it all. Her ebay bids, video rentals, library books.
thank you, patriot act.
so you're stalking your own wife?
want to compare notes?
touch?
you figure out what she likes?
Yep. It's all in the summary.
Pottery-making.
Nancy drew mysteries.
scented candles.
oleander.
old jazz.
anything Italian, except anchovies.
Yeah, I don't thinkyou're gonna find your answer tucked into a list of her ebay bids.
then help me out here, all right? You're the romantic.
I mean, what's the deal with the bottle?
it's an 82 bordeaux.
Yeah. Costs 800 bucks a pop.
it does when it's full. I got it empty.
empty?
look, when kate and I met, we had nothing.
I got that bottle, and I used to fill it up with whatever cheap wine we could afford.
and we'd sitin that crappy apartment and drink itover cold pizza and pretend we were living in the ce d'azur.
how'd that work out for you?
it didn'T.
cause that bottle was a promise of a better life.
what kate got was a guy locked away for half a decade.
you make elizabethany promises, peter?
or you think what she really wants is oleander candles?
Hey, diana. What do you got?
Hagen is leaving the country.
he booked a flight through a private charter companyi n barcelona for the 19th.
one week. Damn it, neal. Seeing you must have tipped him off.
he's going to spain. That's something.
is there any connection to our books and the bondsor the murder?
Hagen's impressive as hell.
a lot of international holdings, but he keeps himself out of the muck.
you get every available agent on this.
you know the good ones. Steal them if you have to.
I want to know every single thing about this guy, and I don't want any excuses.
anything gets in your way... - forge your signature.
always do. -That's what I want to hear.
if you're right about hagen, we have one week to connect him to the bond.
if we lose him on the 19th...
Neal, if we lose him, you're back in.
I can't save you.
you're late. - Hey, give me a break.
I'm a working man now.
so?
we were right about hagen.
of course we were right. - And I was stupid and impulsive, and he saw me.
I have one week to link him to the bonds.
one week or what?
I go back.
no, no, no, no.
Yeah.
did you find anythingabout kate?
apparently, if a tree falls in the forest, it does make a sound.
I may lose her again, moz.
lose her? I just found her.
so did he.
so did he.
remember when you told me not to look for kate?
Yeah.
Neal, you're putting me in a tough spot here.
these were taken four days ago at a san diego atm.
she's going under the name kate perdue.
you know what "perdue" means in french?
Yeah. It means lost.
Yeah. Makes you wonder, right?
is she lost to me or without me?
stop it. - I just need a couple days, okay?
a-after this dutchman thing is over. A couple days to go to san diego.
you could send an agent with me. You can come with me. - Stop. Stop. Stop it!
how many times are you gonna screw up yourlife for this girl?
I hate to break it to you, buddy, but she dumped you -- with prejudice.
exactly what is your planif you find her?
I know there's more to our story, okay? She disappears in the dust --no, that's not an ending.
come on, man.
we've all been there.
it gets easier.
not if she's the one.
I brought this to you. Doesn't that count for something?
no.
we made a deal.
I gave you something good here, and you're about to blow it.
God.
you're right. You're right, peter.
I'm a smart guy.
I should know when I've been dumped.
you figure outyour anniversary plans yet?
I'm getting close --very close.
so you got nothing?
nothing. But I'll find it.
Hey, um... I'm gonna go grab a smokereally quick.
didn't know you smoked.
Ah, it's a nasty prison habit. I've been trying to quit.
Jones, keep an eye on him.
Yeah.
bum one from you?
these things will kill you.
that's what I keep hearing, but I'm not dead yet.
but these filters --they're good.
not for me, you understand.
I tear 'em off.
jones: You need a light?
you should try the patch.
two years and counting, my friend.
I hate the tan lines.
you don't smoke.
what was I supposed to do --fire off a flare?
so, you tear offthe filter?
Yeah. But I'm hard-core.
I found my bottle.
I found hagen.
you first.
this is a warehousedown by the docks. Hagen runs it through a shell corporation out of guatemala.
we didn't know about this. How did you?
I don't think you rely on rumoras much as I do.
let's go.
do you hear that? You hear that?
hear what? - Kind of rhythmic ssh, ssh.
that's a press. Damn it, peter. That is a printing press.
he's printing the bonds in there right now. You can hear it.
how long till they're done?
a multicolor print job as complicated as the goya
test proofs, ink formulation, perfect registration
he'll be running it for days.
Diana. - Yeah, boss.
I need recording equipment down here immediately. - You got it.
come on. - I am on board.
Hagen is our guy.
but we still don't have enough for a warrant.
we know the bonds are there. Just open the door.
Yeah.
well, you should read this --warrant law.
all I've got is sound coming out of a warehouse and no wayto link him to the bond.
I've got to talk to your friend. - Friend?
come on, neal. The guy who gave you a cigarette.
I have no -- what -- you thinkjones is an idiot?
I have to know how he connected hagen to the warehouse.
come on, neal. And you got to trust me.
okay. Okay.
I'll bring you to him --first thing tomorrow.
good.
yeah?
damn.
what's going on?
he ran.
what is this?
Hi, there.
what are you doing? You can't be here.
Oh, I-I'm taking a photography class over at the annex, and pictures of rusty sheet metal are a surefire A.
take him in.
Jimmy! Go get hagen!
what exactly is going on here?!
why'd you bring himinside?!
he was taking pictures.
open the door! You're a dead man!
that sounds like inch-thick lexan.
keys are on their way.
nice.
you shouldn't have signed the bonds.
I'm no stranger to vanity myself, so I understand the impulse.
I'm gonna kill you.
I hope whatever they're giving you is worth it.
it is.
you are a particular kind of bastard!
gentlemen, we have a fugitive hiding in this building.
knock down those doors.
grab the bonds! Come on! Let's go! Everybody, come on!
quick! Let's go! Move it!
come on! Let's go!
get in there!
do not move!
get them up in the air!
this is what the law calls an exigent circumstance.
any of you harvard grads know what that is? Huh?
no hands? - Diana?
exigent circumstance allows us to pursue a suspect onto private property without obtaining a warrant.
and to seize any and all evidence that has been discovered in plain view, regardless of the connection to the original crime.
remember me, friend?
Oh, there's your lawyer.
you know, you're really bad at this escape thing.
what can I say?
cigar? - Cuban?
you should arrest me.
I'll let the cigar go, but you are a fleeing suspect.
is that the original victory bond?
why, yes.
Yes, it is.
you know, this makes me 3-0.
maybe I'm not trying hard enough.
all right, this is good. - Okay.
all right. All right. - Now, I want you to keep your eyes closed.
I promise.
all right.
okay. Open them.
honey, you know how every year, I'm always promising you that we're gonna go...
to the caribbean.
this sort of what you wanted?
well, I-I thinkif I keep my eyes closed, I can actually imagine us being there.
Ooh, and it's getting warmer. - It is.
come here. - Okay
screw top.
cheesy?
it's a little cheesy, but it's... but it's sweet.
maybe this will help.
Belize. - What?!
I found the time.
we have a week and two plane tickets and a seized villain sarteneja.
in -- in where?
Oh, in this really incredible beach front villa that the bureau seized from this narco-trafficker.
it's amazing --okay. It's -- enough.
Just...justtell me it's nice.
it's nice.
I love you.
I love you.
thank you.
thank you.
do you think we can pull that heater in a little closer?
Yeah. It's cold.
Yeah.
can't beat that view.
did elizabeth like it?
she loved it.
coffee?
Yeah. - Italian roast?
going on vacation.
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll be back in a week.
still wearing that suit.
Yeah. I love this suit.
did they makea decision?
figured if we didn't, you'd end up making one of these on your own.
I'm official. - You're a consultant, and I own you for four years.
you okay with that? - Yeah.
you'll be here when I get back?
where else am I gonna go?
Kate leaves you a bottle with a map on it, and this is where it leads us
grand Central Station?
it's something I'd recognize, Moz. Something significant.
s - significant?
grand central station!
something familiar.
she could have sent us anywhere, so she sends us to a place that leads everywhere?
you know, there's a great oyster bar in there.
Hey, I think there's something in here.
"X" marks the spot... again?
Kate likes the classics.
dear Neal, heard you're looking for me.
wish I could explain more, but time is not on our side, but you need to stop looking.
no one can deny what we have, but it's over.
please move on.
all this for "move on."
I'd rather have some oysters.
have a good weekend?
Ah, nothing too exciting. I went to the park.
Oh, great. Glad you're getting out.
coffee?
love to. No time. Got a stolen painting.
it's June's Italian roast.
it's... Haustenberg.
Haustenberg, well... Is it a museum heist?
no. Residential robbery.
I'd like to meet the person who keeps a Haustenberg over their mantel.
I love Haustenberg.
which one of his paintings was stolen?
this one is called "young girl with a locket."
no photograph?
no, but I bet you it's a painting of a young girl wearing a locket.
you don't get enough credit for your deductive skills.
it's worth $2 million and change.
that's nice. Haustenbergs are rare.
not many of his works made it out of Hungary after the war.
Yeah. Rare can make it valuable -- very valuable.
what are you looking at me for?
why do you think? - I didn't steal it.
I know you didn't steal it, but you like paintings.
I'm worried that if we find it, it may be too much temptation for you.
I can handle temptation.
do you want to keep your eyes on the road? - This is a taurus.
car can take care of itself. I'm keeping my eyes on you.
good, good. The road is important, too.
I see the road. - Sorry about that.
no. Don't apologize. That was - he stopped.
you know I didn't steal it. You checked my anklet?
I always check your anklet.
I pull a map up on you every day so I can see exactly where you've been.
what was so interesting about grand central station?
oyster bar -- It's the best in town.
I stayed within my two-mile radius.
I wonder if we've been a little too generous on that.
Oh, yeah.
what, are you gonna sulk now?
you don't trust me.
what did Reagan say? "Trust, but verify."
that was also the motto of the soviet secret police.
get used to it, comrade.
eyes! Road!
let's just recover the painting.
Yeah, and drive.
wow, so, the FBI-- You're really taking this seriously, huh?
we are.
are you the homeowner?
Yes.
Yeah. My parents are dead, I'm over 21, and I was robbed.
any other questions?
was the painting insured?
no.
it's worth $2. 6 million.
um... that's where it was.
Tuesdays I have classes.
uh, the instructor let us out early.
I came in here, and there was this...monster here, and he shoved me up against the wall.
he hurt you?
Yeah.
I hit him in the face, and he said if I did it again, he would kill me.
what did you do?
I hit him again.
do you have a photo of the painting?
your report only had a description.
um... Yeah. Yeah.
can I help you?
Oh, it's okay, Gary. It's the FBI.
they're here about the painting.
Oh, of course.
thank you for coming so quickly.
sure, sure. Were you there when it happened?
no. I was at work at the time.
wish I could be more help.
great.
we looking at an inside job?
thief knew her schedule. Nothing else was taken. I'd go with that.
I'd go with that, too. Help Julianna with that photo.
Gary, I have a few questions.
Gary's your, um...?
uncle. - Uncle.
will that do? - Oh, my goodness.
that's my grandmother.
that's the painting behind her.
could be your twin.
I'll take that as a compliment.
I was named after her. She raised me.
when she died, she left me the house... and the painting.
what did uncle Gary think of that?
you don't look like an FBI agent.
I'll take that as a compliment. What's an FBI agent look like?
um... Him.
you got the photo?
let's go.
I've never seen a guy lawyer up that fast.
I've got that he's a stock trader on Wall Street and that his attorney will answer any further questions I might have.
so, uncle Gary tips off the thief, splits the take.
more likely uncle Gary owes money to somebody, and he got tired of staring at 2 million bucks hanging on the wall.
now he shuts up, and we do this the hard way.
the hard way? A - all we need from Gary is the name of the guy he's working with, right?
right. - So, why don't I talk to him?
you?
Yeah. O - okay, let me rephrase that.
since I am a consultant and not technically an employee of the FBI
a consultant on a tenuous probation.
as I'm constantly reminded. Is there anything illegal about me talking to him?
you can't threaten him. - Don't plan to.
or lie to him. - All right. All right.
no lying. I'm just gonna ask him for the name.
tell me, Gary, does Julianna know you helped steal the painting?
you can't be here. My lawyer was very clear.
first of all, hiring a lawyer makes you look guilty.
he told me specifically not to talk to the FBI.
do I look like an FBI agent?
who are you?
think hard, Gary.
did he send you?
what do you think?
God, I knew this would happen.
what, that whole thing at the house was a setup?
how'd it go wrong?
Julianna wasn't supposed to be there. Now she's a witness.
it wasn't my fault. Her class got out early.
please don't hurt her.
it's not me you need to convince.
tell him -- Tell him I'll make sure she doesn't cause any trouble.
she's ready to sit with a sketch artist.
this is the kind of thing that makes it much harder for him to sell the painting.
how about -- here.
how about a good-faith payment? Here. Here's $300.
that's all I got.
300
all right, you're right. You're right.
um... I can write him a check.
that could work.
he wrote you a personal check to the guy he helped steal his mother's painting.
he was very insistent.
no threats.
no lies. I let him do all the talking.
I'm calling this a gray area.
you know him? - Yeah.
Yeah, he's a...bad guy.
so I figured.
Hey, what about Julianna?
he figures out she's talking to us -- Let's catch the bastard before that happens.
Yeah, we got him.
we've been sitting on him for two days.
they've gone to every high-end gallery in Manhattan offering the Haustenberg.
who's that? - The big guy? Joshua.
ex-military, the muscle who stole the painting.
Julianna wasn't kidding about the punch.
girl has an arm.
and the other guy is Dorsett, French expat.
what's he into, besides shaking down stockbrokers?
high-end loan-sharking, although calling him a loan shark is like calling Oedipus a ma's boy.
he makes questionable loans with big corporate money.
get behind on your payment, he'll firebomb your office.
Ouch.
but the good news is, you get to meet him tomorrow.
how'd you arrange that?
I set it up.
Neal, this is Taryn Vandersant.
she's a buyer at the lambert gallery and is nice enough to help us out on this one.
I convinced Dorsett I have a wealthy client who's very interested in the painting.
how much is he asking?
100000
we've arranged to have the exchange happen at the gallery, Neal.
Jones, let's get a prep.
this should be fun.
what?
have you ever met a woman who didn't
Brittni -- Brittni Nichole... In second grade.
I had a gap in my teeth.
Kate loves the classics.
that's a big load of laundry.
Yeah. It just sold for $120, 000.
What?!
what?
can't put a price on art.
no, you can't, which is why I think $2. 6 million is a little steep for the Haustenberg.
you're not a fan of Haustenberg?
uh, I don't know.
it's a little cartoony for my taste.
you're -- You're a philistine.
Yeah, yeah. I -- I'm the crazy one.
you all set?
all set.
well, let's get wired.
100 grand in cash -- That's a lot of money.
tempted?
why would you think that?
Peter warned me about you.
warned you?
sounds ominous.
does it? - Yeah.
is it true you just got out of prison?
do I look like I just got out of prison?
he said you'd do that.
what? - Redirect.
Yes, I just got out of prison, yes, peter is the guy who put me there, and, yes... I'm tempted.
is it true you escaped for a girl?
Oh... Some people think I'm a romantic.
did she?
I'll let you know.
we got Dorsett crossing 20th.
let's get a camera on that.
okay. They're approaching the gallery.
team one has the eye.
good to see you again. - Good to see you.
as I said on the phone, this is Mr. Devore.
call me George.
it's smaller than I expected.
have you seen the "Mona Lisa"?
it's tiny.
could I see the money, please?
I'd like to authenticate it.
so, you two have known each other for a long time?
we've been friends for, I don't know, how long's it been?
years.
beautiful people are never just friends.
george has a girlfriend.
again, monogamy is the great casualty of beauty.
not always. - Please.
we use the expression "butterfly" for a man who flits from flower to flower.
a man such as yourself could be quite a successful butterfly.
we consider butterflies weak, delicate creatures.
Yes, but flap their wings, and they can set off hurricanes.
that's beautiful. You should write a book.
can we just -- Close the doors, please.
I have a girlfriend myself.
is she faithful? She's French.
I try not to think about it.
brigitte arrived last night, and I shouldn't leave her alone in a new town for long.
perhaps we could hurry. - Of course. Lights, please.
I've got fluorescing cadmium green and azurite blue.
that puts the paint composition pre-1960.
perhaps you can explain why there are people signaling each other outside.
you want us to go? - Not yet.
we can't risk it.
who are they?
if you brought the FBI into this -- It was not me!
I told you to keep a low profile.
you were careless.
you've been flashing this painting all over town. They followed you here.
something is not right here.
damn right it's not.
for my time and inconvenience.
that's it.
move, move! Team one, team two, alpha bravo is exiting the rear of the building -- Move in.
go! Go! Go! - Follow jones!
you okay? - We're fine.
arrest them. Arrest them.
we have to keep their cover. Handcuff them. Read them their rights, everything.
you two are on the north end, opposite side of Jones! Go!
where are they?
they disappeared between the buildings.
anyone have eyes? - Negative.
all we got is this.
what? Ah, they switched clothes. Damn it!
are things always this interesting when you're around?
come on.
you're under arrest.
so, how upset were they that you lost the 100 grand?
"upset" is a bit of an understatement.
it started an administrative inquiry.
everything will be fine if I recover it - When I recover it.
well, the good news is Neal didn't take it.
Yeah.
this is progress.
do you think he actually had anything to do with it?
no, but the thing about Neal -- Nothing is ever what it seems.
the guy's a contradiction.
he's obsessed about Kate, but you should have seen him flirting with this girl at the takedown.
well, honey, that's who Neal is.
that's never gonna change. That's what I love about ou so much.
what, that I lost all ability to flirt when we got married?
honey, it was even questionable then.
who's the new girl? - Taryn Vndersant.
don't know her.
she's a buyer at the lambert gallery.
she's beautiful, seems nice.
well, if Neal's interested, you should encourage it.
encourage it? Oh, I need that like a hole in the head.
honey, if he would fall for the new girl, he might actually stop chasing Kate.
love you. - Love you.
you and Taryn were getting along pretty good yesterday. - She's not my type.
what? Not your -- Why isn't she your type?
she loves art.
she looks like Lara Croft in khakis.
Really? Does she bake cookies for orphans, too?
she does.
I get it. Meet a nice girl, maybe settle down.
simplify my life, probably save yours.
you're lying about the cookies.
prove it.
who's that? - Curator from the Channing museum.
what? Why -- why is he here?
the Haustenberg. - He says it belongs to them.
lose the stupid hat.
how come the Channing didn't report it missing?
we did report it, when it was stolen in 1967.
I have a question.
the painting was stolen in '67, but it's not listed on the art-loss registry.
the registry was established in 1990.
91, actually. You could have re-filed the claim.
I'm sorry. You are who?
he's one of our art consultants.
not familiar with that name.
it's probably for the best.
you're an expert on Haustenberg?
all the late European post-impressionists.
I authenticated "young girl with locket" myself when it first entered our collection.
you'll agree it's an excellent work, a bit sentimental for my taste, but the Matisse influence is apparent.
Oh, well, considering Matisse was a fauvist, I wouldn't agree with that at all.
unless you're talking about his early work, which I don't think you are, and if you are, you're just wrong.
we have reason to believe that this was taken in a residential robbery.
what happened to the painting when it was taken from my museum is not my concern.
now, someone elected to buy stolen property.
I believe that is a crime.
do you know how the Haustenberg came into your grandmother's possession?
she brought it with her from Hungary when she came to this country after the war.
Why?
agent burke, got a question for you.
Yeah. Excuse me.
play nice, kids.
what's going on?
you're not a very good liar.
your grandmother stole the painting.
why would you say that?
she never had it insured.
that was my first clue.
is this like a good-cop, bad-cop thing?
he takes a call. You wink at me.
if we get the painting, it's going back to the Channing, unless you give us a good reason to keep it away from them.
all right. Tell me a story.
how did she take it?
Just...hypothetically.
hypothetically?
a little black dress, a laced bottle of whiskey, and a horny Irish security guard.
why'd she do it?
that's the locket.
your grandmother's the little girl in the painting.
how's it going in there?
Oh, it's -- it's fine. Any luck on Dorsett?
no. Assuming you just walked with 100 grand in cash and the painting, what do you do?
go to ground till things cool off.
where do you go?
Dorsett said something about having a girlfriend.
Brigitte. - Yeah.
how many Brigittes came in from France last night?
accounting for middle names and spelling variations, a lot more than I thought.
well, we can discount connecting flights.
and women over 50.
tell me I'm wrong.
well, that leaves seven.
all right. So, let's pull in some teams, and everybody take a Brigitte.
we'll -- we'll take the girl staying at the Gansevoort.
that's where I'd stay.
you'd think they'd have a satellite for things like this.
the only thing a satellite is gonna tell us is that he's not on the roof.
this is old-school.
old-school.
will you relax? You meditate?
no. - Really?
you look like a guy who meditates.
sandwich?
what is that smell?
that's deviled ham. - No!
come on. - No!
no. Wait. Go back to the game.
no, I called it.
you were just touching the buttons. That's not calling it.
what are we, 12?
I guess we are.
when we're in your car, we can listen to your station.
I don't have a car.
poor life choice.
and we got the game.
what do you think you can afford in that place? - Spot me a $20.
why don't you use your new gold card to get it?
you know about that?
keep it. It makes it easier for me to know what you're buying.
all right, go, but no shenanigans.
you've got 10 minutes. And keep your phone on.
that's for you.
can I buy you a drink?
what?
what do you think?
hookers? - No. No.
that's Brigitte and her friend.
I convinced them to invite us up to their suite.
brigitte likes me. You can have Claire.
are you completely out of your mind?
the room is rented in her name.
we're not breaking any laws if she invites us in.
the 100 grand and the painting could be inside.
wouldn't you like to know if we're sitting in the right place?
which one's Claire?
Claire's cute.
Yeah. She's exactly what I need in my life right now.
all right. There are no men's socks lying around.
brigitte does not look like a girl who's worried about her boyfriend coming home.
Peter, you have to relax.
if we have the wrong Brigitte, we'll know soon enough.
beats sitting in the car, eating deviled ham.
all right, fine.
the second we find out if Dorsett is staying here, we leave, and we call in reinforcements.
done. - They're coming.
she doesn't want us in there.
Yeah, I saw her lock the door.
I bet there's a door in the bathroom that connects to the master suite. I can open it.
no, you can't. - I won't tell anyone.
no, no. You understand the rules here.
listen, I've heard the speech.
what's that?
they want to play strip poker.
Oh... I'm kidding.
but could you imagine?
they want music, all right? Come on. Relax.
all right. - It's over there. Come on.
Neal, I know what you're doing!
cut the French crap! Get out here!
keep them occupied. - I can't keep them occupied!
I don't...speak French!
you know what? I should get up right now.
I- I c-- I can't -- That's a good grape.
it's just -- It's just my phone. Just my phone.
no, I'm just getting my phone. I'm just getting it. That's all I'm doing.
just getting my -- see?
No! No! Please don't!
let's -- Let me have the phone. Give me the phone! Thank you.
Oh, god, it's el!
hello.
I didn't think I was gonna get you.
I was actually gonna leave a message.
Yeah. Well. Uh, saw that it was you. What's up?
nothing. I just got back from a client dinner.
I wanted to see how the stakeout was going.
having a blast.
where are you?
I'm at a -- I'm at a -- - Are you at a nightclub?
Yes, that's where I am.
we -- we -- We're at a nightclub.
we -- we followed him into a nightclub.
at the Gansevoort? Wow, honey. I'm impressed.
I can't believe you got in there.
it's a long story, el.
el, I've got to go. I've got a situation here, okay?
I love you, honey! I love you. It's crowded. It's crowded.
Hey, Neal. Caffrey!
to my dearest julianna, keep this forever.
let me talk to Elizabeth, all right? It's the least I can do.
no, the least you can do is nothing, which is exactly what you will do.
it's my fault. - No, I don't need you to lie to my wife.
you gonna do it yourself? - No.
the truth, peter. Bold choice. - Hypothetically
see, I would tell her that I wouldn't stop complaining about the car, so you let me go into the nightclub, and you witnessed the suspect enter after me and had no choice but to follow.
it's almost the truth.
it's better than alimony.
Yeah. - we lost Dorsett.
God... What about the painting and the cash?
all gone.
Dorsett escaped.
this is bad. - Yeah, this is bad.
you know, this one may be a real problem, EL.
so, if you don't find Dorsett, what happens to Neal?
he's done. He's back inside.
do you actually think he stole it?
Yeah. Yeah.
you gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'll be -- I'll be fine, yeah.
honey, listen. About last night at the hotel.
you mean the nightclub. - Yeah.
well... Neal was complaining about my sandwich, and then he started fidgeting with the radio, so I
there was no nightclub.
I know.
honey, you don't think after 10 years I know when you're... - Stretching the truth?
well, that's a nice way of putting it.
next time, just tell me.
that's what I told Neal.
then stick to it.
I will.
I know you're a good man.
was she cute?
well, now, that depends on your definition, 'cause I-I got to plead the fifth on this one.
Yeah, okay.
who is this? - I could ask you the same thing.
you seem to have many names, George.
Dorsett. How'd you get this number?
you bought my girlfriend a drink with your credit card.
I'm impressed with your resourcefulness.
now you will see mine. I want the painting.
if it is not returned, Joshua will pay a visit to your beautiful friend at the gallery.
you leave her out of this.
brigitte was out of bounds, yet you involved her.
you set the rules. Now you must play by them.
I need two days. - That's all you have.
you stole the painting?
I was going to give it back to Julianna.
you're like a child -- No sense of consequence.
okay. Will you look at the inscription?
the Channing curator said he authenticated the painting before it was stolen.
he saw that it belonged to Julianna and chose to ignore it.
and you're Robin Hood.
and did I forget to mention the part where you stole the painting?!
I didn't think Dorsett would get away.
this is because you don't like the guy from the Channing.
you did this for spite.
I've done things for less.
I can't let him go after Taryn.
so, what are you gonna do?
this better be good.
I took the painting.
damn it, Neal.
I wasn't gonna
I did it for
I can use it to catch Dorsett. He doesn't know I work for you.
we'll set it up tomorrow.
now get the hell out of my house.
okay. El. - Bye, Neal.
well, he, uh... Told you the truth about the painting.
because they threatened Taryn.
it's a start.
Yeah. It's a start.
you know you have absolutely no impulse control.
hand me the Naples yellow.
Haustenberg's brushwork is much more fluid. You're being choppy.
Nah. My brushwork's fine.
this could trick the occasional tourist, but this guy at the Channing will not be fooled.
I'm sure he won't.
this pigment needs to be aged.
I'll go preheat the oven. - It's 125.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know how to age a painting.
how tenuous is my probation?
it's pretty thin. We need this one.
it's simple, right?
Yeah, so don't make it complicated.
take Dorsett down quickly.
if I get him, you trust me again?
Yeah, comrade.
you still gonna verify?
Oh, yeah.
here we go.
surprised you had the guts to come yourself.
it's not bravery.
I simply don't trust Joshua with a million-dollar painting.
is it hard to live like that, not trusting the people closest to you?
I suppose, but I'll take the money.
you won.
Yes, but it was a good game.
FBI! You're under arrest!
Haustenberg was her father.
Yes.
she was his illegitimate daughter, but he had a family then in Hungary.
it was before the war.
how did the painting end up at the Channing?
he willed the painting to my grandmother, but when he died, the museum chose to ignore his will.
who cares about the illegitimate daughter of a famous artist?
it's not theft when rich men do it.
how do you know that the Channing won't try to take it back again?
because if they do, the curator will have to explain why the museum went against Haustenberg's wishes, and...i don't think he wants that.
Neal, what have you done?
problem? - No, no.
just, uh, overcome with the, uh...
I'm thrilled to have the original Haustenberg back where it belongs.
forbidden romantic meetings are kind of a personal thing, Moz.
Yeah, like I was gonna let you come alone.
what if the guy with the ring planted that note?
he didn't.
you'll be happy I came when a red laser dot suddenly appears on your forehead.
enough with the hero talk. Kate left the note.
okay. Maybe she wrote it three days ago or maybe three months ago.
she'll be here.
well, it is Friday, and It was noon, so where is she?
Kate, where are you?
I don't have a lot of time.
you're here.
Neal, are you still there? Neal.
stay there. I'm coming
no, Neal. Neal, he's close.
the man with the ring?
Yes. - I don't care.
listen, I need you to tell me where you hid everything.
what? - The money, the bonds, the art -- all of it.
Why?
he wants something -- something you took, something you hid.
I hid a lot of things.
well, then, give him everything.
if he gets what he wants, he'll let me come back to you.
who is he? - I can't tell you. It's too dangerous for you.
dangerous? Why? Kate, just tell me. I can protect you.
this is the only way you can help me.
you always told me I had to trust you. Well, now you have to trust me.
I want to come home.
please just tell me where you hid everything.
no.
I want to come home.
it's the only leverage I got.
just stay there, okay? I'm coming up.
Mozzie, tell Neal I love him.
tell him it's the only way.
please tell me this isn't gonna be another mortgage-fraud case.
what's wrong with mortgage-fraud cases?
they're boring.
you stare at paperwork all day.
you could stare at prison bars all day.
Oh, you still playing that card? - Makes me smile.
get out of the way.
why all the craziness? - I don't know. This can't be good.
Peter, uh, Hughes wants to see you right away.
all right.
so, is this what it looked like when i escaped?
I don't know. I was working important cases.
what's going on?
the bureau's missing an agent.
that isn't good.
Yeah, he's an undercover from the d. C. Office. We lost contact with him 12 hours ago.
what do you think happened?
I don't know. Could be in trouble, could be laying low. We're not sure.
listen. Listen to me. We need somebody who understands money.
excuse me. I have an important case to deal with.
this is agent mark costa.
he was posing as a drug trafficker looking to clean some dirty cash through this guy
lao Shen, money launderer out of china.
Costa was working him until last night.
according to his last contact, Lao was making a pit stop in New York for 72 hours and after that, he boards a flight to the homeland and we lose him.
so, why are you telling me this?
nicholas Halden. - Who?
cut the crap, Neal.
we know he's one of your aliases.
you created him to launder cash through that canary island scam you ran in '04.
multimillionaire with a penchant for gambling -- ringing any bells?
I may have heard of him.
are you willing to offer him full immunity?
done. I don't give a damn what you did five years ago.
I want to find my agent.
then what can nick do to help?
we want you to make contact with Lao using this identity.
what do you know about Pai Gow?
I know it sounds delicious.
it's a Chinese version of poker played with dominoes.
not really my game.
make it your game.
lao likes to contact new clients using certain hands or bets.
he'll be playing an underground table in Chinatown tomorrow night.
I'm not gonna lie to you -- this is a dangerous one, Caffrey.
high stakes.
I'm in.
I asked you to teach me the game. This movie is terrible.
wait.
let's take this to the next level.
you took it to the next level when you killed my family.
your wager, then.
100 grand?
how did he know about Nick Halden?
can't believe they knew about him.- Let's be honest -- nick was not your best work.
he's no Steve Tabernackle.
steve was a good man.
steve is a good man.
besides, you should be more concerned with what the guy with the ring wants.
I don't know.
I've stolen a lot of stuff in my lifetime.
maybe Poe's "Tamerlane" book?
no, no. Sold that a while back.
the Tamayo painting.
not worth all this.
washington's love letters.
seriously, I don't even know why you stole that in the first place.
Martha -- oh, oh!
it's my favorite part.
too rich for your blood, Lee-Kang?
I believe it is your blood that will make me rich... Farmer-boy.
okay, what are they doing right now?
Oh, they're drawing from the wood pile.
with these tiles, they make two hands.
uh -- oh, wait! Wait!
he just played the death tile.
death tile?
w-well, the movie takes a few liberties.
then why are we watching it?
it's a cult classic!
okay, fine. What do you have to do?
fold above the bank.
if I get a better hand than the dealer and then throw it away, Lao knows I'm a prospect.
okay.
well... I-ideally, you want something like this.
this is some of the best tiles you can get.
you trash a hand like this, and you're in.
it's like folding pocket aces.
all right. Then let's practice.
all you have to do is lose.
you want to practice losing?
no, I have to win first, then lose.
I thought perhaps you gentlemen might like something to eat.
Oh, thank you, June. - Thanks, June.
What're you watching?
tiles of fire." Ohhh!
part 1?
part 2's up next.
don't start without me.
there's a sequel? - Five.
good news -- we've put word out Nicholas Halden's in town and looking to do business.
Lao's people took the bait.
we're sending you in as an investor to his money-laundering scheme.
Lao's game takes place just off of Mott Street, which means we'll be setting up around the corner.
at MeiShilin restaurant?
been there. Good dumplings.
and an even better h. Q. For our purposes.
family that owns the place are trusted c. I.S for the bureau.
they've had dealings with Lao in the past.
we'll monitor the game from the second floor.
Look...there's an agent missing in all this.
so everyone stay sharp.
the FBI is truly grateful for your help, Mr. Tuan.
I just want Lao out of the neighborhood.
he's been taking from my business for years.
and with my own debt piling up, I can hardly afford to be in his.
I understand.
look... I, too, am grateful for your help. Come on.
those standard FBI issue?
they were a gift from Elizabeth.
one that keeps on giving.
we tried to make room.
it's perfect.
apologies.
my daughter, Bai.
Uh...hi, there.
I'm gonna need that back, okay?
there. Thank you.
who are you?
what do you mean? The kid just grabbed the -- do you have a business card?
do you have a business -- hey, hey.
it's okay. It's okay. Ready? Watch this.
ready? One...two...three!
Where'd it go? Where'd it go? Where'd it go?
is it right here? Is it right there?
how silly. Here you go.
xie xie.
you know, every time I see you do that, I check for my wallet.
all right.
let's get you suited up.
game starts in 10.
you reviewed the building layout?
camera surveillance, electronic passcode -- it's standard stuff.
any questions? - Just one.
where did Elizabeth buy those socks? 'Cause Christmas is coming up soon.
enough.
there is one small problem.
what?
that's a really nice fake.
it's more concerned with telling us where you are than telling time.
we deactivated your anklet 30 seconds ago.
Lauren, if you'll do the honors.
be gentle.
Yeah, never really been the gentle type.
all right. There's a GSM transmitter inside.
it's one-way, but we'll be able to hear everything that happens.
everything?
lao is dangerous, Neal.
we are pulling you the first sign of trouble.
I'll be fine. As long as I don't draw the death tile.
there's a death tile?
halden's golden.
he got through.
what happened here?
Lao.
he was in your home?
no -- his men. They came in one night to make sure I would pay.
with a gun.
they fired a bullet 2 inches from my baby's crib while Bai was still sleeping in it.
how you doing?
don't get 'em wet, don't feed 'em after midnight, right?
never mind.
yung sing.
it's a toast -- drink and win.
yung sing.
8 and 7. Nice hand.
I'm out.
you could have won.
I have more important things than winning.
you folded on a good hand, Mr...?
you know who I am.
and you know why I'm here.
for a man of your reputation, Mr. Halden, it took some time for you to find the hand you needed.
pai Gow isn't my game.
what is your game?
perhaps we should discuss that in private.
we have time for that.
another hand?
don't rush him, Neal.
I'm always in for one more game. - Good. Good.
Peter, we got a problem.
NYPD got a tip-off. They're about to raid the game.
who the hell tipped them off? - I have no clue.
they're gonna get Neal killed.
you get me captain Shattuck of NYPD before they crash this whole thing.
cops!
they're not with me.
I don't believe in coincidence.
maybe you should.
Lao, let's go.
everyone down!
down! Put your hands on the table!
everyone down! Down! Freeze! We will shoot.
come on, Neal. Just give yourself up.
tell them you're FBI.
fired. Shots fired.
we have a white male -- 6-foot, gray suit --heading out of the building.
I don't think he gave himself up.
maybe it's not him.
trying to save my cover here, guys.
it's him. All right.
if he's not with me in three minutes, you mobilize backup and tell NYPD to stay the hell out of our way!
and where are my damn shoes?!
I'm getting a little tired of being chased, peter. Call the cops off me.
where is he, jones?
he's moving north on Allen.
it's okay.
lao says to let me handle it.
have I thanked you for that drink?
no.
remind me to.
lao knows why you folded back there.
he respects it.
come with me, and you can complete your business.
is he gonna point any more guns at me?
you'll be fine. Trust me.
then lead the way.
you getting this, peter?
he's trying to save the operation.
looks like they're heading to a hotel off mulberry.
if Caffrey doesn't leave Chinatown, then neither do we.
Jones, I want two of our guys positioned in the front and rear of the place.
once that's settled, find out what the hell happened back there.
get the NYPD call log, for starters.
I'm not buying this coincidence at all.
who is this girl?
that's what you're gonna find out. - Where do you want me to start?
plenty of traffic cams in the area.
have NYPD pull a photo from one of those.
another all-nighter?
I married a perceptive woman.
and i married a predictable man.
all right. So no dinner tonight.
how about lunch tomorrow?
that sounds great.
what did Neal do now?
nothing... yet.
you know, I wouldn't worry too much about him.
he respects you, you know.
I think you're overselling our bond a little bit.
I don't.
good luck.
nice place.
when will Lao be joining us?
he won't be.
then what are we doing here?
he told me to stay the night with you.
there's only one bed.
I wasn't planning on sleeping. Were you?
let me get you a drink.
only Caffrey.
already seen this one on cinema.
I haven't.
lao says I should keep an eye on you until we can arrange another meeting.
so, what do we do until then?
relax?
have a drink?
I'm good for now.
it's not drugged or poisoned.
why don't you just relax?
what are you doing?
taking you off the clock.
what happened? - We just lost his transmitter.
should we go in?
no. We've got guys on the entrances.
we can track Caffrey if he leaves the room.
assuming he leaves the room.
Hey, that was an expensive -- fake?
I am really tired of guns being pointed at me tonight.
nicholas Halden isn't the kind of man who would wear a fake watch.
Neal Caffrey, on the other hand... Oh.
you know who i am?
you've been on our watch list for years.
could you be more specific? 'Cause I've been on so many, it's kind of hard to keep track.
Interpol.
you know my name, but i don't know yours.
my name is Meilin.
why is Interpol interfering in an FBI investigation?
it's the other way around.
you called the cops.
and you screwed everything up by impressing Lao with your fancy table tricks.
now I'm stuck with you.
well, am I such a bad guy to be stuck with?
if you take Lao, we'll never get to his boss. He's a much bigger fish.
Yeah, I get it. Turf war. So, why are we here?
you're gonna let Lao walk.
Yeah, I don't know if you heard, but the bureau and I are kind of pals lately.
I can't flip on them.
you can botch the deal.
besides, if you help me, I'll make sure you get the one thing you want most.
what, a new watch?
what do you know about Kate?
I know where she is.
so do I. I want the man who's got her.
I can help you with that.
I think I'll take that drink now.
Oh, damn.
Oh, I told you to wake me if I drifted off.
Oh, come on, boss. You needed a break.
anything happen?
Nope.
how long have I been out?
uh, about a half an hour.
okay.
get some rest. I'll take over.
okay.
what happened to my sock?
I don't know. I was watching the monitor, remember?
did you steal my sock?
you're a little klepto, aren't you?
you have no idea what I'm saying, do you?
no. Keep that up, you'll end up like Neal.
you don't want that. Trust me.
he's unreliable.
he never listens to you.
and he always gets himself into trouble.
I mean, it's not like I'm worried about him.
I just feel responsible.
anything happens to him, I'll have a lot of paperwork to fill out.
paperwork's a hassle.
Neal's a hassle.
but then again, that was a neat card trick, huh?
nice to know I'm appreciated.
I knew you were there.
yeah? - Yeah.
you also know she speaks perfect English?
you're weird.
I want my sock back.
you're a bad influence.
how'd you get here?
I, uh, caught a lift with one of the G-men you put in front of the hotel.
I told those guys to call me if they saw you.
no, I told them not to bother you.
you get a little cranky if you don't get your beauty sleep.
what happened to the watch?
I must have banged it up during the chase.
when did it cut out? - While you were in the hotel room.
Oh, that's too bad.
guess you missed all the good stuff.
so, can she make the meet happen?
she'll contact me with the time and place.
good. Jones, if you'll do the honors.
uh, NYPD traced their tip-off on the game to a cellphone registered to a Ms. Meilin Wan.
it's the same girl Caffrey had a sleepover with last night.
are you sure about that? - Yeah.
that's from a traffic cam about a block away at the exact same time the call was placed.
uh, carrier company lists a hostess bar on canal as her place of business.
I want to check it out.
I'm curious why Ms. Meilin wants to call the cops on Lao's game especially if she wants to keep your deal alive.
you got a problem with that?
let's go.
looks like our employees are on break right now.
any thoughts on how to approach this one? No?
isn't this the part where you say, "we should buy them a drink"?
I can't go in there. It'll blow my cover.
guess I'll have to show you how it's done.
hello.
agent burke, FBI.
I want to ask you a few questions about one of your co-workers -- Ms. Meilin Wan.
uh, one at -- one at -- one at a time, please.
could -- does anyone -- does anyone know where she is right now?
Oh, really? Do you know where she lives?
that's the same guy who caught me, right?
that's the guy who caught you twice.
does anyone speak English? Anyone?
no. O-okay. All right. All right, thank you. Thanks very much.
so that's how it's done?
Yeah, that's how it's done.
amazing what someone will say when they don't think that you can speak their language, isn't it?
have a translator meet us at the office.
let's see what they were saying behind the back of the bumbling FBI agent.
Where's the translator?
won't be here for another hour.
Oh, damn it.
all right, let her run. Maybe we can pick up a name, at the very least.
Meilin Wan. What? Meilin Wan. Oh, really? Did you...
catch anything? - Not so much.
someone called you a bad name.
there you are. Sorry about that.
we're, uh, taking victor's statement, and I guess she heard your voice.
all right, let's go.
hold on.
I got an idea.
these ladies are mean.
they think you're stupid.
leave that out.
something about Meilin working a night shift -- a place called red lantern.
where do i know that from?
well, it could be a club or a restaurant.
could be a sunburnt superhero. It's a waste, peter.
following Meilin's not getting us any closer to Lao or Costa.
found it. Red lantern exports.
it looks like costa suspected it was a shell company for lao.
that's what he was looking into before he disappeared.
so she had a part-time job at a warehouse.
that's an eclectic rum?
still wasting our time?
Jones, look up that address for me.
so, the results on Meilin's facial scan came back.
you got anything? - Nothing...
because it came back restricted.
restricted?
which means she's either a C. I. Or working for another organization.
run it through the interagency database.
already did.
she's Interpol.
wow, you think Neal knows?
well, he spent six hours alone with her in a room -- he knows.
maybe he was keeping his cover.
okay. He knows. - He's playing me.
well... There's really only one reason why he would keep something from you.
just one?
what are you gonna do?
pick that for me.
don't we need a warrant?
Oh, look at you -- a law-abiding citizen all of a sudden.
I got goose bumps.
agent costa already filed for one.
I don't have my tools. - Well, i got mine.
I think I just saw the ark of the covenant back there.
if my face melts, let me know.
sign of a struggle.
scuff marks.
looks like someone was dragged right down that way.
blood.
it's agent costa.
Lao's men.
I didn't see an alarm system.
they're not here for us.
then who? - Costa.
Oh, come on. No service.
no, no! What are you... - You got a better idea?
I let them walk right out the door!
Oh, would you rather be dead?
this isn't a game, Neal.
I think it's time you and i had a little heart-to-heart.
about what?
your friend at Interpol.
look, i never lied to Peter.
you did leave a few things out. - You don't understand.
I need to find Kate.
she's in danger.
look, my husband really wants to trust you, but you keep giving him reasons not to.
you're on your own on this one.
No! P-please stay! Don't go!
so, what now?
now I wouldn't take you off this case if i could.
I w-- I wasn't talking about the case.
what did Interpol promise you?
did Meilin promise you Kate?
look, what was i supposed to do?
she said she could find her.
in exchange for what?
they want Lao to walk.
do you know why?
they're after his boss. - Lao doesn't have a boss.
you know what this is really about?
it's about jurisdiction.
if they arrest him on Asian soil, they get additional funding from china's government.
additional funding? - Yeah.
half a million dollars -- that's the price of a dead FBI agent.
you really think you can believe everything she tells you?
we either take down Lao now, or our partnership comes to an end.
we're partners? - You tell me.
Hello, Neal, dear.
I was just having a charming conversation with your friend.
it has been wonderful to meet you. - Likewise, June.
now that I know you're such a wonderful host, don't be surprised if I stop by again soon.
I'd keep my eye on that one.
what happened to costa?
what, no small talk?
I saw a dead FBI agent today.
not really feeling like small talk.
I'm the reason you found that body.
you expect me to believe you left a bread-crumb trail on purpose?
your agent deserved a proper burial.
well, he didn't get one.
was his cover blown?
lao suspected he was working for a competitor, not a government.
you don't believe me.
I have pretty good reason not to.
you lied to me about why you want Lao. - And?
and you're letting a murderer go free to curry political favor.
if that sits right with you, then maybe I should rethink our arrangement.
I'm just doing my job.
and right now, my job is to make sure the FBI can't monitor any of Lao's accounts during your meeting tomorrow.
doesn't matter to me what happens after that.
the man who's got Kate... ...i know who it is.
anklet off.
and you'd better not break this one.
when they scan you for bugs, manually deactivate the transmitter.
press it again, it turns it back on -- and you damn well better turn it back on.
I will, peter.
once you give Lao our account number, we'll be able to scan the dirty money.
between that and the audio from the watch, we'll be able to put this guy away for good.
anything else? - Yeah.
good luck in there.
do you have the account number?
and you're ready for this?
ready.
he cut the signal.
what's important is when he turns it back on.
keep an eye on the bank account.
I'm gonna give you a new account number to use -- one the FBI can't trace.
got it? Repeat it to me.
I got it.
relax, Neal.
it's almost over.
I apologize for the scene the other night.
as you know, you can never be too careful.
Oh, I completely understand.
I think you'll find this to be the beginning of a very rewarding relationship for both of us.
I hope so.
Meilin speaks very highly of you, Mr. Halden.
the account number, if you please.
any movement on the account? - Nothing.
come on, Neal.
and just like that, we are partners.
we'll contact you in two weeks with your money, minus the 10% fee, of course.
of course.
all right, I did what you wanted. Now tell me who has Kate.
it's all in there.
Hey, Lao.
we never got to finish our game.
I'll make it worth your while -- an extra 10% if you win.
very well.
come.
lose your money.
what are you doing?
Oh, I already transferred the money from your account.
doesn't matter what happens now, right?
one more hand and I'll have all of your money.
are you certain you want to go again?
just to keep things interesting... ...my watch for yours.
come on, Lao.
what's life without a little risk?
why not?
the signal's back.
what is that?
that sounds like dominoes.
you look worried.
do I?
some days, the tiles don't fall the way we want.
some days they do.
at least I lost my watch to a worthy adversary.
it appears luck was not on your side today.
the strange thing
even though my profits are one hundredfold in business, a victory with the tilesis supremely more satisfying.
the american had no talent. - They rarely do.
the outstanding parcels have been delivered.
and the body?
disposed of, sir. - Good.
a dirty business. It will be a relief to be home.
anything good on the radio?
we got him.
he'll be gone for a long time.
lao may as well have confessed in front of a grand jury with the hours of transcript we have on him.
I just want to thank you and let you know that you are welcome here anytime.
neighborhood's better off without Lao.
you know, I think these are the best dumplings I've ever had.
I'll get you some more.
so, are you gonna tell me what was on that flash drive?
you were right.
it was empty.
Oh, no.
close your eyes.
Why?
would you just close them?
open.
david Copperfield she isn't.
Xie-xie ni.
what's next, partner?
don't call me that.
yeah?
Hello, Neal.
you calling to apologize about the empty flash drive?
that was a necessary precaution.
I had to be careful with something this sensitive.
so you know who has Kate?
I don't have a name, but i know this -- he's FBI.
how do you know?
how do you know that?
Kate says "adios" to you at prison and gets busy with her disappearing act.
missed her by two days. Where'd she go?
she's a ghost, man.
she did an outstanding job of melting away.
she's being held by someone. She's too scared to say who.
Interpol told me the man who has Kate is with the fbi.
you think it's Fowler.
I do now.
what's he want from you?
could be anything.
I'm not done with this investigation, Burke.
neither am I.
Neal, Neal, he's close.
the man with the ring? - Yes. He wants something.
who is he? - I can't tell you.
please just tell me where you hid everything.
Hello, Kate. - Hello, Peter.
we need to talk about Neal.
if only there were some way to compare this to your life.
I get it, Moz. I'm a pawn.
your analogy lacks creative thinking.
you're upset because it's accurate.
see, Kate has reign over the entire board while your movements are more...
restricted.
Fowler has to be lying about Peter.
there's no way he has Kate.
Neal, everyone has a price.
and Peter's been in the perfect position to control everything.
I hate to give the suit credit, but he's smart.
I know him.
there's no way he could do it.
if you're so sure, then prove it.
find the ring... ...you find the king.
that's ifhe has it.
I'm the bishop, if you were wondering. - I wasn't.
do you trust him?
look, he's the guy you want for this.
well, you didn't answer my question.
morning, Peter. - Morning.
agent Landry, meet Neal Caffrey.
the con man turned fbI consultant.
my reputation precedes me.
well, you're hard to miss.
you took a swan dive out of a judge's chamber into a bakery awning.
I really don't like that picture.
but they do have the greatest cake in town.
what's up?
agent Landry is here from the dallas field office.
he's following a boiler-room case.
actually, I'm just still catching Burke up on the details.
nice to meet you.
Oh, yeah.
you think Caffrey is the right man for this job?
Oh, yeah. - He's a criminal.
so are the guys in the boiler room.
look, I busted him for bond forgery.
I know the story. Then the guy breaks out of prison.
three months left on a four-year sentence.
then he's an idiot.
no. No. It was for a girl.
well, it looks like he could have his pick.
Yeah, well, there's something special about Kate.
point is, she's no longer an issue.
you got a tracking anklet on him? How's that work?
we can pull a map on his movements at any time.
when he's working or with me, we don't worry about it.
when he's off the clock, he's on a two-mile radius.
he goes outside that, we get an alert.
look, you need somebody who can sweet-talk their way into a high-pressure sales environment.
he's your guy. - Thanks.
got some rangers tickets -- box seats.
you guys interested?
okay. - Boop.
this is a boiler-room scam.
we've got an office full of junior Gordon gekkos, selling bad stock.
it's a classic pump and dump.
guy in charge buys half a million shares of dollar stocks, gets his boys to inflate the price by selling it over the phone, then dumps his stock when it peaks, leaving our buyers holding worthless shares.
people are losing their homes over this.
guy last month got taken for $50, 000.
he's got three kids and no roof to put over their heads now.
the average victim of this scam loses nearly 30 grand.
so we need to shut this room down.
room is mobile?
Landry: they've run this operation four times now.
every time they dump the stock, they pick up, move to another location.
who's the guy in charge?
that's what we're trying to figure out.
Landry has got somebody on the inside, a female informant.
female. How did she work her way into the boys' club?
she hasn't.
that's why we're sending in someone who can.
someone who can hustle with the best of 'em.
I guess we won't be drawing straws.
all right, you're gonna interview with a guy named Brad.
of course his name is Brad.
you think I can keep up with these guys? Peter, I'm flattered.
Oh, give me a break. You could sell light switches to the amish.
Madison cookler -- that's our girl on the inside.
Yeah. Exactly.
she won't know who you are.
what's her role in all this?
the guys transfer the calls, after they make a sale, to her.
she takes down all the buyer's information.
but thanks to her, we know exactly what kind of stocks these guys are looking to hawk.
we went fishing with several of our own front companies.
they took the bait on that one.
Rhymer pharmaceutical.
and you got a tap on every phone in the place.
Yep. We're recording every call.
but the sales are real.
we just want to know who's behind it all.
so do i. - What's that?
nothing.
for me? Peter, I didn't get you anything.
for me? Peter, I didn't get you anything.
we call it an eagle.
recorder, transmitter, gps.
keep it on you at all times.
love it.
we need to cut your anklet on this one.
love it even more.
no, you don't.
after your last escape, we need a home run.
a lot of people think i made a mistake.
well, let's prove them wrong.
Yeah. Or else you're headed back to maximum security.
glad some things never change.
of course, I want to make this money for you -- more than anybody.
Madison, give me some good news.
two closes, 3,200 shares.
Yes, that is what I like to hear.
Yeah, don't get your hopes up. I already got dibs on that one.
does she know that?
since when does that matter?
I'm Brad. You must be, uh...Nick halden?
guilty as charged.
Hey, uh, your u5 says you were terminated from lehman brothers.
Yeah, the market crashed.
haven't been feeling the love.
Oh, you couldn't find a job working anywhere else?
I wasn't interested. I want to make some real money.
listen, our turnover rate is huge.
high volume, high money.
you make sales, you get paid.
you know what? Don't waste time taking down client information.
just transfer it over to the girls over there.
they mop up.
it's women's work, anyway, right?
Yeah, okay.
let's do this.
hang on a second. I haven't hired you yet.
you, take a break.
let's start your interview.
okay. You gonna give me some numbers?
Yes. Take your pick.
this 216 area code feels lucky.
you got that? 216.
Cleveland. Getting ready to reroute the call now.
is there anybody in particular you want me to send it to?
come on, newbie. Mr. Charles Fairweather is waiting for the deal of a lifetime.
what am I selling him?
the dream, which today is Rhymer pharmaceutical.
Hello?
Mr. Fairweather.
speaking.
my name is Nick Halden, and I want to be your broker.
I've already got a broker.
Really? How's he doing for you?
he make any money last year?
nobody made any money last year.
that's not true.
if you were with me, you would have netted 3%.
and that's after the crash.
I don't believe you.
well, you got an e-mail address. I'll send you my earnings report right now.
biotech and alcohol were up.
peter: how did you get my number?
your old broker.
he's not smart enough to keep you to himself.
what do you do for a living, charlie?
I'm a history teacher, but I'm not interested
the only history that's worth a damn is the history we make today.
you know who said that?
I believe Henry Ford said that.
Yes. Yes, he did, and he was right.
have you heard of Rhymer pharmaceutical?
no. - Of course you haven't.
cause your job is to teach, and my job is to know about companies like Rhymer before everyone else.
you know when you don't buy a stock?
when your cab driver tells you about it.
now, if you'd known about ibm before the invention of the microchip, would you have bought in?
of course.
well, Rhymer is poised for a breakout on the same scale.
monday, the fda will approve them to begin clinical trials on a quantum confined nanotechnology that has the potential to transform cancer medicines.
and I can get you in on the ground floor.
that sounds like insider trading.
not at all. No, it's completely legit.
look, i pore over a thousand pages of scientific technical b. S.
so I can make you rich at 3 bucks a share.
let's start small, okay?
a thousand shares.
I double that for you next week, and then we get serious.
sounds nice, but I'd have to ask my wife.
your sale just died, rookie.
Mr. Fairweather, if you invest with me, the only question you'll have to ask your wife is what kind of hardwood floors does she want in her new house.
I don't know.
life comes down to a few moments, Mr. Fairweather.
this is one of them.
he's good.
I'm in. But let's make it 5, 000 shares.
thank you.
I'll transfer you over to one of our girls, and she'll take your information.
so, how did my interview go?
Yes! Yes! - Yes?! Yeah!
believe me, I wouldn't be giving you this information if I didn't feel confident enough to own a few thousand shares myself.
what do you mean you don't invest over the phone?
look, the Cuban missile crisis was solved with a phone call.
we have to move on this right now.
you don't get rich buying into a high market.
the market is down.
what do you need, an engraved invitation?
look, you want the good things in life? What are you gonna do? Are you gonna work harder?
no, you're gonna invest smarter.
Oh, Jones, turn that down.
the college tuition is gonna be covered.
see, now you're starting to talk like a smart investor.
look, this is a stepping-stone to your first million.
all right, I appreciate your business.
come on, crazy eight, let's go.
crazy eight?
no?
you land close to eight whales in one day, you can buy your own Nickname.
time to hit the bars!
Oh, no, we're not going with them.
why not?
he wants to meet you.
who?
the man behind the curtain.
if Caffrey goes out of range, we'll lose his audio.
that's okay. He's still recording.
that's him? - Avery Phillips.
Avery phillips is the youngest guy to have a seat on the new york exchange. The man with the plan.
he finds the stocks, fronts the cash, we do the legwork.
who's he talking to?
his business partner.
he looks upset.
usually they work together.
our room is all Avery, which is why they're not exactly simpatico right now.
keep that to yourself.
you must be my new rainmaker.
Yeah.
I see you're having problems with your associate.
bro.
I don't want to get pinched because you're having domestic troubles.
you've got balls.
I like that.
what my business partners and I discuss isn't of your concern.
so go relax. Have fun.
not cool.
it's a little early for you to be calling it a night, isn't it?
Yeah, well, I got the man behind the curtain.
his name is Avery Phillips.
all right, I want to get moving on this.
meet me in the office in an hour.
I'm in your neighborhood.
why don't we meet at your place?
my place?
Yeah, it's a little late for the bland bureau walls.
besides, you have better coffee - Yeah, I do.
coffee, my dear.
thank you, Mrs. Burke.
you're welcome. I was gonna be up in -- What?
six hour anyways.
Thanks, honey.
that's him? - Avery Phillips. The man with the plan.
he finds the stocks, fronts the cash...
that's a good start.
Jones? Hmm?
Lauren's pulling up intel on Phillips. Check your e-mail.
got it.
well, Avery's been very busy.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go rummage through your drawers and steal your most precious belongings.
I'm kidding. I need to go to the bathroom.
upstairs. First door on your left.
leave the seat down when you're done.
I'll be damned.
everything all right?
never been better.
okay.
first door on the left.
find anything?
uh, maybe.
Avery's credible on paper.
he runs a separate legit brokerage with this man, Daniel Reed.
I saw them arguing.
they're partners.
Yeah, but they don't trust each other.
sounds par for the course.
checked with finra.
their business is profitable, but something tells me that Avery's trying to push out Reed.
they've run the boiler-room scam together on the side in the past, maybe for startup capital.
but according to your new buddy Brad, this current shop is all Avery.
he's planning something on his own.
so, let me wrap my head around this for a second.
let's just say I'm Reed.
you're Avery. You're trying to screw me.
Why?
money. - It's that simple.
isn't it always?
so you manipulate your friends and the people around you.
Yeah.
all to get rid of you.
and I never saw it coming.
Moz: what's with you?
I found my ring.
it's Peter.
I'm so sorry, man. I truly am.
I don't understand why.
he's a suit.
this is what they do.
are you gonna play it out?
what choice do I have?
well... They've got you off your anklet for this one.
you could run.
I'd need some cash.
we can get cash.
so, what are you gonna do?
get the money.
we know who we're after.
now all we need is proof that Avery is getting a cut of the profits from the room.
well, can we get the boiler-room books?
we make that request, we tip our hands, and they close shop.
no, we need another way in.
Lauren: we already set up a company they're exploiting.
how about we set up a c. E.O. To exploit them?
where you going with this?
well, let's say that the owner of Rhymer pharmaceutical is onto the scam.
so he walks into Avery's office with a proposal.
earning reports and a share of the profits in exchange for silence.
we create the right backstory, give this c. E.O. A working history.
it could fly.
question is, who do we send?
how about you?
you look like a guy people can trust.
but I'd also believe you could be bought, for the right price.
if you played it right, I mean.
all right, that's all.
do we have a problem?
why would there be a problem?
no, I'm just excited to see you go undercover. It doesn't happen very often.
it happens more than you think.
I still have some active aliases.
you're a man of many faces.
I appreciate your business, ma'am.
I'm gonna transfer you over to my associate Madison.
will you hold on just a moment?
I'm about to close a sale.
that's cool. Just don't transfer the call to Madison.
why not?
just do what you're told. - What am I, an intern here?
look, I have no idea what's going on, all right?
Avery says freeze out Madison, that's what we do.
just go to Linda for now.
all right.
and, by the way, uh, Avery's having a party at his place on saturday.
clear your calendar.
you hear that?
Yeah, sounds like they're getting suspicious of our inside man.
woman. - Yeah."woman."
I need that ebid analysis Tuesday.
Jason. Tuesday.
Mr. Edison. Glad to meet you.
no, you're not.
direct. I like that.
I know what you're doing to my company.
Rhymer pharmaceutical isn't worth all that attention.
tell me why a guy like you is buying all those shares.
you have proof I bought any shares?
we both know how these games are played.
I may not work on wall street, but that doesn't mean I can't smell a shark in a suit.
you're making a move, some kind of a move, and you're setting yourself up big.
that's what guys like you do.
why are you here, Mr. Edison?
bottom line? - Yeah.
I want in
the money you stand to make from taking over my company means that you owe me board membership to your firm.
I'm not talking about controlling interest, just a taste of the profit.
or what?
or I talk to the feds.
or I talk to the shareholders.
do you know who I am?
Yeah, I'll give you until monday to give me your projected earnings.
you know what you stand to lose.
I want to know what I stand to make.
tell you what.
I'm having a little get-together this weekend.
I'm not here to be your friend.
if we're gonna do business off the books, we should discuss it off the clock.
fair enough. What do you have in mind?
pull!
Yeah. Yeah!
Hey, what's going on over there?
Avery's doing a little business.
maybe you should mind your own.
you know, you're a little psycho.
I'm just playing, dude.
come on, crazy eight, you're on deck, man.
no, no, I'm cool, man. You already loaded it. You take that shot.
pull!
nice place.
well, what can I say?
I'm a boy with my toys.
what's life like without a little fun, right?
how old are you, anyway?
25 this month.
but just because I'm ahead of the curve doesn't mean that I can't enjoy my success.
you want to see something really cool?
sure.
come with me.
comics.
my prize possessions.
I've been collecting since I was a kid.
you still are a kid.
guilty as charged.
I'm Peter pan in the flesh.
every kid needs inspiration.
these are mine.
this is nice.
I could trade that for your car.
you like superheroes.
those that go above and beyond what the ordinary human can do. Yeah.
that's you -- minus the cape.
you'll love this.
this vault is completely tricked out.
if there is a fire, the room clamps down, the air is sucked out in 10 seconds.
that's pretty cool.
damn right.
you steal from me, same thing.
the door shuts, you'd die with no air to hear yourself scream.
Yeah.
good shot.
Mr. Edison, these are the guys.
guys, this is Mr. Edison.
who's up?
Nick is.
no, I'm good, man. You go ahead.
dude's been passing on us all day.
not really a gun guy.
peter: let the grownups play with the big-boy toys.
do I know you?
no, I don't think you do.
Nick, back off, man.
it's all right.
is there a problem, Nick?
just take your shot.
Pull.
Pull.
just 'cause I don't like guns doesn't mean I can't use one.
damn. That was crazy.
why don't you boys keep this party going?
you can have a cocktail... Shoot something.
we've got some business to take care of.
Hey, man.
why is Madison here?
just shoot some birds, man.
they know she's a mole.
damn it.
this is gonna go bad fast.
back my play.
no.
Neal, what is wrong with you?
I saw your ring.
what? - I know you've got Kate!
a lot of us have those rings. Not now. Back my play.
this guy's been playing you!
you got yourself a spy!
what, are you selling me out now?
trust me. I'll explain it later.
I knew I recognized this son of a bitch!
what do you mean?
search him.
check everything.
what is that? Hmm?
what is this?
what is this?
who are you?
like he said... I'm a spy.
are you ready to rule?
Oh, I'm the one you can't trust? That's a good one.
who are you? S.E. C? Fbi?
you really think the fbI could afford a gadget like that?
no. - He's a corporate spy.
who do you work for?
your partner.
Reed? - You think he doesn't know what you've been planning?
he's been onto you for months.
take Madison home.
put her in a car, give her a bottle of wine, tell her she's employee of the month.
how do we keep this quiet?
we're gonna put him on that trap, and we're gonna launch him off the front lawn.
you really gonna play the whole bad-guy thing?
no. You buy him.
flip him on Reed.
what's Reed planning?
he knows you're gonna cut him out of his half.
he hired me to find out how so he can cut you out first.
how am I supposed to flip him if I can't even trust him?
pay me in stock.
I help you, I get rich.
I screw you, I get nothing.
I want 5%.
got coJones on this one.
I'll give you 2%.
3%. - Okay.
3%.
Neal, are you out of your mind?
Peter doesn't have Kate.
you sure about that?
Yes, I am.
how often is he gone, Elizabeth?
how many late nights when you don't know where he is?
okay, stop it. Peter is the best thing that ever happened to you, and you're smart enough to know that.
Yeah, well... He has the ring.
that's your evidence?
here's the ring.
it's a 10-year fbi pin.
put in 10 years, you get one.
most of us have them made into a ring.
well, I've never seen you wear it.
it's a fraternity thing.
come with us to the next bureau accommodation dinner.
you'll see hundreds of them.
will I get one? - No.
I'm sorry, Peter.
I promise you, we'll figure out who it is.
whoever it is is with the bureau.
Yep, that is a problem.
but I need you to help me get Avery first.
go in and play Reed against him.
make him think his partner's betraying him?
maybe he'll do something stupid.
thank you, guys. - It's all right.
you gonna tell him that you met with Kate?
I don't think he'd trust me enough for me to tell him what happened that night.
after the case.
then i'll decide.
now what?
I want you to tell Reed that we're gonna dump the stock next friday.
when's the real dump?
this Friday.
while we're celebrating, he'll get to watch his stock become completely worthless.
this is Brett's hot dogs, from, I guess, wherever they make them -- I'm not sure.
um...And that's all we do all weekend -- eat hot dogs.
excuse me.
could you give us a minute, please?
Yeah, go ahead.
thank you.
this better be good.
it is.
you know who I am?
Yeah, you're avery's new "rainmaker."
your partner's cutting you out.
what?
get lost, kid.
I want you to tell Reed that we're gonna dump the stock next friday.
when's the real dump?
this Friday.
while we're celebrating, he'll get to watch his stock become completely worthless.
that son of a bitch -- I'm gonna kill
no, you do something, you lose your chance to win the upper hand.
why are you telling me this?
I figured it might be worth something to you.
why do I need you?
because Avery trusts me.
I'm trying to make a profit.
we can take him down, make some money in the process.
and what do you need?
access.
I want his financial records, proof he's been running these rooms.
we can hold that information over his head.
the problem is, I couldn't find anything on his home or office computer.
Avery doesn't trust computers.
cause they're too easy to hack into.
but he has a ledger.
there's no paper trail because he literally keeps it on paper.
find this ledger, and we got him.
we need to figure out where he keeps it.
I know exactly where he keeps it.
this has got to be where Avery holds the book -- with his comics.
it's a perfect location.
Yeah, according to the company who installed it, we're dealing with a state-of-the-art fire-suppression system.
it's the same kind they use in the top museums.
when triggered, a polycarbonate glass wall seals the room, and then a hydraulic vacuum sucks out the oxygen.
fire dies, no damage to what's inside.
and if I'm in there, no air to breathe.
well, there is a kill switch.
but we don't know where it is.
wonderful. - Yeah.
tech lab has another cool gadget for you.
this minI breather. It will give you five minutes of air, just in case the system is triggered.
it'll fit perfectly in one of these.
cigar tube -- nice.
FBI's been watching "thunderball."
breaking out all the toys on this one, guys.
anything happens, Jones and Lauren will be stationed with a unit right outside the property.
five minutes' worth of air.
Yep.
what's your response time?
roughly five...minutes.
roughly.
I'll be at the house to back you up in case anything goes wrong.
how are you gonna pull that off?
they're dumping the shares on friday, so everyone's having a little party to celebrate.
we're both on the invite list.
so just -- just so I'm clear, um... If anything goes wrong, I suffocate.
then we'll make sure nothing goes wrong.
Yeah.
or I can practice holding my breath.
- I do.
twin turbo v8 with adjustable rear spoilers.
quite a piece of metal.
once this deal is done, you won't settle for the street model.
you'll be able to get the design of pre-release from Italy.
ever been to the factory in maranello?
no.
they've got their own wind tunnel. It's unreal.
what are you gonna do with your money?
put it in a secure 401 and mutual funds.
it's all about security, bro.
I'm just messing with you, man.
I'm gonna buy a cruise ship, hollow it out, and turn it into a floating mansion.
damn. - How about you?
I'm gonna buy an island. - An island?
Yeah, then i'll learn how to play the guitar and just chill.
you don't need an island for that.
don't kill the dream, broheim.
I got dibs on that one.
Oh, yeah, does she know that?
since when does that matter?
Hey, you're gonna be back in time for the celebration, though, right?
wouldn't want this to go to waste.
Yes!
no.
trip wire.
must be a pressure plate.
Hey, cruz. Move your team into position. Get ready on my mark.
we got a problem.
that's Avery's partner.
10 more minutes before we're rich.
we're already rich. - Billionaire rich, man.
buffett rich.
think i might want to go to space.
catch a ride on one of those russian rockets up at the space station.
you do that.
excuse me.
Yeah, heads up.
reed just came though the front door.
all right, hold your position, but be ready to move.
you got it.
all agents, hold your positions.
what's up?
you're a son of a bitch.
why don't you ease back on the hostility?
what are you celebrating? Huh?
we don't have anything to celebrate for another week!
uh, we're just relaxing. I figured the boys could use a little reward for all their hard work!
no. I couldn't let this go.
I know what you've been up to.
don't you come into my house, bringing all this chaos.
shut up!
I've been talking to your spy buddy.
my spy?
um, my spy?
you hired him. I'm just flipping him back on you.
what are you talking about?
now you're gonna play stupid with me?
you thought he worked for me?!
I never hired a spy!
where is he?
Brad, where's Nick?
crazy eight? He's getting busy with the -- ...waitress.
he knows about the ledger.
suit up.
this is about to get ugly.
suspect is in the house. All teams move in.
all right, we need to find the kill switch.
take this.
no. No.
we look together. We share the oxygen until Jones comes.
there's not enough time.
five minutes for one person. 2 1/2 minutes for two.
No! Neal! We're wasting time.
Peter, I trust you.
if Caffrey's in the vault, he's got five minutes of air.
the clock is ticking.
let's move.
we should go.
hold on.
I've never seen anyone die before.
drop your weapon! Drop your weapon!! Hands in the air!
all right. Come on, Neal. Come on.
that was a long five minutes.
Yeah.
what you did in there... - Ahh, I knew you'd take care of it.
you're crazier than I am.
you got my back, right?
Yeah.
there's something I need to tell you.
and I need you to listen to everything before you react.
I don't like the sound of that.
I know what he wants from you. - Who?
the guy in the picture with Kate. You call him... "the man with the ring"?
how could you know that?
Kate told me.
and now... I'm gonna tell you.
?
the night you confronted Fowler.
Yeah, he said he was investigating you.
he is.
this picture was on my desk the same day that you had it.
and you never said anything.
what was I gonna tell you?
I recognized the ring.
this guy with Kate is with the bureau.
I started poking around, trying to figure out who it is.
it's Fowler.
I think so.
of course. Yeah. You start digging around, that's when he bugged your phone.
Yep, the phone, the opr investigation, operation mentor -- all of it.
he wanted to know what I was onto.
and that was Kate.
I passed word to her saying I wanted to meet, talk about you.
what happened?
Hello, Kate.
Hello, Peter.
we need to talk about Neal.
I guess we do.
Kate, put the gun on the table.
you recognize this?
Yeah, i've got one, too.
just like Fowler.
who?
shoot me or put the gun on the table.
it's been a while.
five years.
first time I caught Neal.
what do you want?
leave Neal alone.
I can't do that.
why not? What does Neal have that you so desperately want?
I can get it for you.
why would you do that?
Why?
because he's good.
because he's the smartest guy i've ever met.
and I'm tired of watching you twist his heart around.
he's my friend.
let him go.
Neal stole a piece.
he's stolen a lot of things.
this one is special.
it's a music box.
that's my price.
did you ever love him?
tell Fowler I know, and I'm not backing off.
don't push him.
he's controlling her.
I don't think so.
she's not working for him, Peter.
Neal, when are you gonna face the facts here? She may not be on your side.
you're wrong! - Oh, damn it, Neal, come on!
I looked into her eyes!
I didn't see concern for you.
no. This is an angle.
she wants this music box.
do you know where it is?
I might.
come on, you're gonna cut me off now?
I know where it is.
good.
so what is it?
Catherine the great had a room in her palace in st. Petersburg made entirely out of amber.
you've heard of it?
Yeah, it was dubbed the eighth wonder of the world, but nazis looted it in world war ii.
Yeah, well, one of the things they took was an amber music box.
it's got to be worth a few bucks.
Yeah.
but not enough for all this.
there's something inside it.
it's holding some secret.
I want to see it.
I'm gonna need some time.
well...it's ready.
are you ready?
you folded.
you're back in chains.
Ah, I have to see this one through.
okay, so, Fowler wants the music box.
let's give it to him.
where is it?
I don't have it.
what? You told everyone you had it.
I never told anyone. Everyone assumed I took it, and I never corrected them.
it did make you appear... Superhuman.
image is everything.
now what?
now I find the music box.
and steal it?
welcome back.
thank you very much, Elizabeth...um, Liz.
thank you, Li. I had a nice night.
nice night?
Hello!
Hi.
where have you been?
uh...I go Chinatown.
Um...movie watch movie.
a kung-fu movie? Yes, Ben. I go bed now.
nice night.
Goodnight.
Good...night.
Oh, yes. Uh...good...night.
very good.
fantastic!
Miller THEATER, HOUSTON
alright, yeah, just a little more over the shoulder next time.
I want to take it from the lift.
just a little more sustained. Sure.
OK? Because I think you have time musically.
Oh, yeah. Alright.
so seven, two, three, eight, two, three...
and up with the accent, and hold a little longer.
Argh! Bobby!
what have you done? What's happened?
Oh, God.
Argh, sorry.
Oh, Christ. They'll bring you some ice.
what about one of the principals or soloists?
well, they're all away on vacation.
david Trembath's at Galveston.
well, he can make it here in time, surely.
li's better than he is. It's tonight, Ben.
and Li's just a student here. The union won't allow it.
Ben, this is the biggest night on the arts calendar.
how's he supposed to learn 'Don Quixote' in three hours?
he already knows the solo.
all he to learn is the pas de deux.
everybody who is anyone is gonna be here tonight, including the Vice President.
Yes, I know, but Li told me he once danced for the great Madame Mao. I think we're alright.
but he's Chinese.
what I mean is...
I mean, he can't play a Spaniard, can he?
well, unless I'm mistaken, Betty Lou,
I distinctly remember
Marlon Brando playing a Japanese villager.
Oh, I loved that movie!
Ben, what if he's not up to it?
he's up to it, Cynthia.
and keep the Spanish feel, keep that attitude.
just do it with as many pirouettes as you can.
and be sure to finish on the music.
that's...
it's not too late, Li. I mean, we can cancel.
um, no.
um, I can do this, Ben. No, you can do it.
I know you can do it. Go from the top of the pas de deux?
the beginning? Yes. From the beginning.
OK.
get close to her, ready for the one-arm lift.
OK.
OK.
when the show starts, if you can't see there, you can...
wooh, thanks.
I hate the opera.
but they have the ballet too.
I just hope it all works out.
ladies and gentlemen, take your seats.
tonight's performance of 'Die Fledermaus'
will commence in two minutes.
vice president Bush and his wife, Barbara.
are attending the opening of
houston Opera's summer season 'Die Fledermaus', by Johann Strauss.
starts of the Houston Ballet are also...
Oh, hi. Hello.
you better be right, Ben Stevenson.
consul Zhang, so glad you could make it.
die Fledermaus
Lori, um...woman dancer called, um...'ballerina'.
what you call man?
Danseur noble'.
not nice, not like 'ballerina'.
OK, well how about Big Ballerino?
Ballerino.
I like.
all set, Big Ballerino?
all set, Big Ballerina.
ladies und gentlemen,
I would like to present to you all two very special guests from sunny Spain.
Oh, come on.
not bad.
Oh, boy.
fantastic!
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!
how 'bout that, huh?
Bravo!
OK. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
there's a card.
OK.
the lucky carp wind chime.
legend has it that as the carp swims upstream, "it has to leap...
.over many obstacles, "and with the final leap, "it turns into the celestial dragon.
li, wait. Slow down one second.
I'm a virgin.
um...A virgin?
it means I've never done it before.
done what?
I've never had sex before.
you know what sex is?
Yeah.
one, two, three, four, five, sex!
no. No.
no? No, no.
it's how a man and a woman make a baby together.
you want to make a baby?
No! No.
no, no, no, no. No! That's not what I'm trying to say.
no. What I'm...what I'm...
never mind.
so the roster for the opening week of 'Swan Lake' will be posted today, but Li will be guesting Bobby's role.
you've got to be kidding, right?
no offence, Li, but I'm Bobby's understudy.
of course you are, David.
it's just an opportunity for Houstonians to see Li dance before he goes back, that's all.
alright?
in fact, i have applied to the Chinese Government for permission for us all to tour China next year.
that's right. I'll be in that.
Oh, yeah, me too. Hey, you just stay injured.
it'd be a first for an American company.
more kung-fu?
Yes. More kung-fu.
fantastic.
Goodnight.
Goodnight!
thank you for coming, Mr Stevenson.
no, not at all.
I received a telex from Beijing last night.
I'm sorry, but the request for Cunxin to have his stay extended has been refused.
but I thought...
is there anything we can do?
no, Mr Stevenson, there isn't.
li, don't worry. I'll...
you'll be able to come back. I'll make sure of it.
I'll do everything I can.
I promise.
Ben not understand.
he's too much in love with China.
in China, not so easy.
tell you what to do, where to go, what can say.
maybe I can't come back.
you know, I must dance political ballet in China, but I dance better here.
Yeah. Because feel more...free.
well, there are several options available for you to stay in the United States, if that's your wish.
seeking political asylum is one, but that's the last option I'd recommend because it means you'd have to defect.
no, no defect.
li's worried about his family.
he doesn't want to make thing difficult for them.
he also wants to be able to go back and see them.
OK, well from what I've read and heard about you,
I'm certain we'd be able to qualify you, based on your extraordinary skills as a performing artist.
what would be involved, Charles?
well, we'd have to get supporting statements and a petition signed by an employer, the Houston Ballet Company, no doubt.
alternatively, if you were in a relationship or planning to get married soon, and your spouse was a US citizen, well, there would be no issue whatsoever because the Chinese Government recognises international marriage laws.
are you in a relationship, Li?
uh, do you have a girlfriend?
no, he doesn't.
uh, yes, I have, um, American girlfriend.
you what? How about that! Who is she?
Really?
well, first of all,
I would strongly advise against a marriage of convenience, unless of course it was a serious relationship you're in.
if there's one thing worse than an immigration problem, it's a marriage problem.
is it a serious relationship, Li?
is it serious,
Li?
on behalf of the Houston Ballet Company and all of us who've had the privilege of seeing you dance, Li,
I'd like to say how exiting it's been having you here.
you came as a student, and leave here as a star.
Um...just...
thank you, Ben.
and...
.Thank the audience.
thank you, America.
mr Stevenson, we're ready for the photograph with Consul Zhang.
excuse me. Of course.
I don't know. Has anyone seen him?
I'll just ask you to step in together.
great.
thank you.
consul, Anita Jones.
Anita's the arts editor for the 'Houston Chronicle'.
I'm pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you too, sir.
mind if I get a few words from you about Li and what it means to China to have had him here?
of course.
excuse me. Sure.
I see it as another positive step in...
he's not at the theatre.
did you try my place? Sure. No answer.
sir, we're ready to serve.
do you mind if we just wait... just a little longer?
Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you.
they're starting to wonder. Well, I know.
maybe you should say something.
I don't know what I'm going to say.
mr Stevenson, it's for yOu.
what the hell is going on, Dilworth?
Where's Li?
li, you can't stay here. It's out of the question.
Ben, um...I'm married.
you're what? I'm married.
I not go back to China.
no, you can't be married. Don't be ridiculous.
I mean, who did you marry?
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth? Elizabeth who?
Oh, you conniving little bitch. Stop!
Ben, I love her.
you are going back, Li!
if you love China, you go back.
I...I stay.
you are not married! He's not married!
for God's sake, Ben, calm down!
Li...
li, Consul Zhang will think it's all my doing, just to keep you here.
please, don't do this to me.
I-I not go back.
you have to. You have to.
don't you understand, it's gonna ruin everything
everything I've worked for.
I can't believe you'd be so selfish.
li, no-one is making you do this.
mr Foster, I want no trouble for Ben.
I must tell Consul Zhang I make decision, not Ben.
that's all very well, but the consulate is Chinese territory for all intents and purposes.
I explained that to him already, Charles.
please have a seat.
well, well. Mmm!
right.
I don't know hoW you could be so foolish!
hi there, I'm Li's attorney. A lawyer?
ridiculous. And you should know better!
I had no idea Li was gonna bring a lawyer.
let's try to keep things positive, shall we?
I couldn't agree more.
thank you for coming. So many of you.
consul, how are you? I'm...
I know who you are, Mr Foster. Pleased to meet you.
my staff tell me you are a member of the US China Friendship Association.
Yes, I am.
I was in China 18 months ago, as a matter of fact.
vice Consul Lan is happy to discuss legal matters if you would be so kind as to go with him.
mr Stevenson, perhaps you could accompany them.
Yes, I'd be happy to. I'll be right back, Li.
now, if you'd please allow me to speak with Cunxin alone.
no, I'm gonna stay with Li.
well, don't you have balls!
well, it seems like I need them.
I'm staying too.
we have been asked to leave.
Dilworth, I speak to Consul Zhang.
it's OK.
what did he say?
it's OK. We'll wait.
OK.
I'm interested to know how and when, exactly, was it that Li Cunxin arrived at this decision?
with all due respect, sir, that is not what we're here to discuss.
I'm only too happy to discuss it.
think we should...
would you care for some refreshments?
no, thanks. If you'll excuse me,
I'll get back to my client.
please sit down, Mr Foster!
No!
what's going on?
help! Someone help! What's going on?
now, I'm not gonna put up with... Goddamn!
Li! Li!
help! Li! Li!
Li! Li!
open this doOr, goddamn it!
come back here! Li! Li!
No! Help! Li!
Li!
what do we do? For God's sake!
what's happened? Where's Li?
they took him! Upstairs!
there was at least five of them.
what have you done with Li?
please, I must ask all of you to leave now.
excuse me, Consul, but believe someone just dragged my client out of here.
mr Foster, you told us you're a supporter of US-Sino relations, and what is best for US-Sino relations is for Li Cunxin to return to China.
please, let me try and convince him...
well, that's all very well but for one thing, sir.
we may be on the territory of the People's Republic of China, sir, but in this country, what you're doing
wherever you're doing it
is called kidnapping, and it's against the law.
well, he's just walking... you just drove him away.
I think we should just leave. No!
how can you ever say that after what we just saw?
li is a Chinese national.
I think we should just go and let the Chinese deal with it.
weren't you even listening?
the course of Li's return to China has most likely already been mapped out.
all they need is for us to leave so they can go through with it.
go through with what, how? What are you talking aboUt?
remove Li in the early hours, heavily sedated I suspect, and putting him on the first plane back to China.
who the hell is calling me at this hour?
it's Charles Foster, Judge.
sorry to wake you.
this better be good, Charles.
Yes, well, the Consul General of China is holding a ballet dancer against his will.
I need to get a restraining order.
do I have the right to restrain the Consul General of China?
sir, I sincerely hope so.
there are members of the press outside.
Mm-hm. You're a lawyer.
will you make them go away, please?
consul, not even the President of the United States can make the press go away.
did you call them, Mr Foster?
no.
I suspect they want to know what's happened to Li.
my advice to you is they don't have to know.
what's happened can be our secret.
but if you continue to hold Li here, you're gonna put our secret on the front page of every newspaper in the world.
I'd like to use your phone again, please.
phone?
mark Gibson, China desk officer.
Yes, this is Charles Foster.
there's been an incident at the Chinese consulate in Houston.
please alert the ambassador in Peking immediately.
mr Foster, there's no need to make any more calls.
please hang up the phone. Where's Li? I want to see him.
may I have your attention, please?
I'm pleased to inform you that Li Cunxin has decided to return home to China.
you may all leave now.
if you don't mind, I'd like to hear that from Li.
Yeah, he's just saying that!
if you do not leave voluntarily, you will all be removed.
Oh, yeah? Just try.
we are not leaving until we see Li!
mr Stevenson, but you assured me you are not at fault.
I'm not. And I'm not saying I don't want Li to go back.
I'm just saying... well, let me see him.
just gonna have to wait. Oh!
houston Chronicle', Mr Foster.
is Li Cunxin being held inside the consulate?
I'm not making any statements at this time.
are you his attorney? Thank you.
you know, when I was little, my aunt had a cat named Chairman Miaow.
I could never figure out why.
Miaow.
chairman Miaow. Oh, for God's sake, Dilworth!
here, kitty-kitty!
a Chinese puzzle is taking place in Houston, involving an exchange student from Peking, an American girl, the government of the People's Republic of China and the Department of State.
his attomey is believed to have contacted the Vice President to put pressure on the Chinese Government in Peking in order to effect his release.
I hope you don't get me into trouble, Charles, or you're gonna be sorry now.
I hope so too, Judge.
I just need you to sign this restraining order.
let's say we worry about that later, hmm?
houston Chronicle: Hostages in Chinese Consulate
excuse me, please. Thank you.
yes?
I have an order I'm serving under authority of the US Marshal.
we open at nine o'clock.
would you please tell Consul Zhang that Charles Foster is here? Wait.
mr Foster? Not now!
sir, you should know the vice President has had discussions with Premier Deng Xiaoping.
we expect instructions will soon be issued from Peking, via the Chinese Embassy in Washington.
Li?
come to bed, please,
you can't keep doing this night after night.
they're watching.

Oh, no, Li. It... Oh!
it's not that easy, you know.
I mean, it takes time to get established.
and I know thIs isn't your home, but right now, it's next best thing.
you don't know a soul in America, outside of Houston.
of course, you're a brilliant dancer and you're very popular here, so I'd be lying if I said I was doing it entirely for you.
Elizabeth?
she's just...
she's not good enough to dance with the company, Li.
but, you know, the company is having open auditions.
we're required to do that once a year. They're coming up.
alright? Alright, I'll think about it.

No! You prima ballerina.

he got her back fRom the Australian Ballet.
you must have met her in China.
she's gonna be doing Swan Lake with you.
Lori, Ben do this to you because you help me.
no, Li, that's not true.
Yes, it is.
I cause many problems.
for you, for Ben, for Liz.
for my family.
have you tried contacting them?
I write letter. Nothing.
what about calling?
no.
making too much trouble, maybe danger for my family.
better not.
better they forget their sixth son.

it was just a dream.
just a dream. Shh.
Hi.

I want to dance, Li!
I have my dreams too.
at least you can go to sleep at night thinking about yours.
in night, I think of my family in China.
I worry, Liz. There's no sleep.
just nightmares and terrible feeling all the time.
well what about my feelings, huh? What about me?
you don't understand.
no, stop telling me I don't understand.
I want to dance, Li.
I've tried to be what you want me to be, and I can't do it!
I can't do this anymore.
I'm going to San Francisco to audition.
I need to get into a company. You understand, don't you, Li?
Yes, I understand.
when we got married...
.was it because you loved me or was it because you wanted to stay?
Bec...because...
.because I love you.
I love you too.
it's been five long years since Li Cunxin made his dramatic leap to freedom in Houston, Texas from communist China.
he's here in Washington and he'll be dancing at the Kennedy Center tonight, and we're thrilled to have him with us on the show today.
welcome to Washington, Li.
thank you. It's great to be here.
li, you've toured with the Houston Ballet Company and danced all over the world, but your freedom come at a price.
Yes, it did.
I haven't been allowed to go back to China since.
but your entire family is there.
Yes.
have you heard from them?
do you even know how they are?
no, I haven't heard from them.
how do you survive, not knowing?
I carry a picture of them wherever I go.
and when I dance, I dance for them.
I saw you dance together in New York.
I've never seen such exquisite partnering.
thank you very much.
you made it look so natural.
that's because he is.
well, it does help to have the right partner.
li, there's someone here who wants to see you.
Hello, Cunxin.
I'm working at the embassy in Washington now.
you have made us very proud tonight.
thank you. Thank you.
excuse me.
your mother and father are well.
I took the liberty of checking.
you don't know how much that means to me.
if I have a dream, it's to be able to go back one day.
I know.
is there any chance?
I'm afraid not enough time has passed, Cunxin.
but I will see what I can do.
thank you. I really appreciate that.
thank you.
WORTHAM THEATER, HOUSTON, 1986
ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sorry, there's going to be a slight delay.
we have some VIPs coming in from out of town, and when they arrive, which won't be long now,
I'm sure they'll be forgiven.
so thank you very much for your patience and understanding.

OK.
Thanks.

he and Mary McKendry married and now live in Australia with their three chidren.
Ben Stevenson left the Houston Ballet after 27 years as Artistic Director.

Charles C. Foster still practices law in Houston.
he is recognised internationally as an authority on Immigration law.
Elizabeth Mackey danced with the Oklahoma Ballet for some years.
she is now a speech therapist working mainly with children.
realists don't fear the results of their study.
then why don't you find me more favorable results, Dostoyevsky?
I hit everybody who would or could know About the damn music box.
nothing's coming up.
keep looking.
Ah. Your anonymous chess opponent again.
why aren't you more curious about who's sending them?
I like the mystery.
your girlfriend's missing.
you can't find the one thing that might free her.
one could say there's enough mystery in your life.
Where's the postmark from on this one?
there isn't one. - There isn't one?
as in, someone hand-delivered this card to your door?
this is odd.
the other cards are blank, but the new one has a picture Of the museum of natural history on it.
a good mystery makes life interesti.
you know the chinese curse,may you live in interesting times.
you know that's the first of two curses.
what's the other one?
may you find what you're looking for.
what's the move?
uh, knight to d7.
knight to d7.
you've done this move before, haven't you?
Moz, I know who I'm playing.
Keller, This was our last game.
looks like he's in New York.
who won?
I don't know. We never finished playing.
you're here early.
so are you.
what are you doing?
research.
heist of the American museum of natural history.
not your normal hotbed of crime and intrigue.
Yeah. It's probably nothing.
hold on.
interesting list of items stolen.
antique cork duck decoys from the storeroom.
they also took wax-sealed supply lists
and french soil samples that belonged to Dr. John Bartram.
the father of american botany.
just playing a hunch?
Oh, they already have a suspect. They caught a guy stuffing his backpack.
he's out on bail today.
maybe we should go talk to him.
we could do that.
I think it's great you've taken an interest In a small-time museum heist.
history is important.
Yes. Duck decoys and french soil samples.
you don't want me looking into this. Why?
I don't want to waste your time with a hunch.
cut the crap. What's going on here?
look, I'm being honest with you, peter. I don't know yet.
all right, clearly, there's something bigger going on.
I don't believe for a minute this campos is the mastermind, And neither do you.
who's pulling the strings, and why do I give a damn?
I have a theory.
look out! Look out.
that's campos. - Oh, my god, manuel!
you're gonna tell me what the hell is going on.
right.
manuel campos just died in I. C.U.
his wife's a mess, says she didn't see the driver.
NYPD's out of leads.
tell me who's responsible for this.
his name is matthew keller. He's the blue-collar version of me.
Keller? He's been on our radar before.
and he always slipped off.
Interpol has linked him to everything From arms smuggling to stolen antiquities.
Yeah, but they never had anything more than hearsay.
Keller has never been caught.
all right, who is he? Some kind of rival of yours?
more like an opponent.
we met at the grand casino, Cut our teeth in monaco working the world backgammon finals.
last I heard, he pulled the stockholm airport robbery.
drove right up to a flight unloading krugerrands.
left fake bombs on the runway so no one could follow him.
you met him playing backgammon?
it was simpler times.
if this is Keller,I'm guessing he posted campos's bail So he could get rid of him.
all right.
what's with the museum heist the cork and the wax?
it was a bet keller and I made a long time ago.
counterfeit a bottle of wine owned by ben franklin.
you and your wine. That's why people are dying on the street?
Marie antoinette gave Franklin a bottle of chteau du munn.
it's rumored to be in private hands, But it's never gone to auction.
the point is, the Franklin bottle can't be counterfeited.
it's a challenge --Figure out who can pull off the impossible.
may the best man win.
I don't care about your rivalry.
if he's my killer, I want him.
let's check around,See if there's any chatter on this bottle.
Mr. Cattigan.
sir roland cattigan.
sir cattigan.
you know about this franklin bottle?
Yes. A seller will be presenting it on Friday,And we will be adding it to weatherby's auction.
who is the seller?
may I ask why the FBI wants to know?
it's a forgery.
Oh, that's quite impossible. The franklin bottle
can't be faked,I've heard.
well, my seller wishes to remain anonymous.
then you're gonna have to disappoint him.
tell me, agent, do you fashion yourself a wine aficionado?
I like a good pinot now and then.
Pinot. You've seen "sideways."
your point?
my point is that my palate is insured by lloyd's of london For a million euros.
my point is that you don't understand The subtleties of my business.
I think I do.
word gets out a high-profile bottle like this is fake,You're done.
now, I don't want to shut your business down
with a warrant and search your premises.
but I will.
I don't know the seller.
but the broker for the bottle Is a woman named grace quinn.
satisfied?
I believe I am.
what's this? - My search warrant.
put me down for moo shu pork.
I'm a bad influence.
our broker's name is grace quinn.
says here that she runs an upscale wine cellar Called bin 903.
think we can link her to Keller?
let me talk to her. - What?
you can't go asking around with a badge.
you'll scare him off.
I'll tell her I'm representing a client
who's interested in the bottle,See what I can dig up.
you know where to find me. - Always do.
chteau latour, Mouton rothschild.
a case of ptrus, 1945.
that's a serious collection.
look, my client doesn't want his ex-wife or the I. R.S. - To know about his holdings.
that's not uncommon. We're very discreet here.
if you'd like to bring him by,
I'm hosting a private wine tasting
to celebrate weatherby's annual sale.
does that invite extend to me?
if you bring your client, it does.
we'll be opening some rare bottles.
all right, I'll see what I can do.
my client is a very cautious man.
it'll help if I can give him a firsthand account of the facilities.
any chance I can get a tour?
of course.
right this way.
as you'll see, our vault is state-of-the-art.
humidity is at a constant 62%,
temp at 50 degrees fahrenheit.
nice.
Ooh! Sorry about that.
it's okay. That's what it's here for.
we change the code every day.
good.
I notice you don't have surveillavce cameras.
we consider our clients' anonymity to be top priority.
I assume it's something
a cautious man like your client would appreciate.
well, you assume right, grace.
shall we?
chteau du munn, post-french revolution.
nice.
who's the collector?
I can't say.
wouldn't happen to be the same individual auctioning the Franklin bottle on Friday?
I can't comment on that bottle.
but, uh, no.
it's not the same individual.
seems more his speed.
that I can neither confirm nor deny.
let's be honest with each other.
I know you're brokering the sale.
you shouldn't.
if I didn't, I wouldn't be very good at my job, ms. Quinn.
your client must be well-connected.
that I can neither confirm nor deny.
I'd lo to meet the seller of the bottle sometime.
he's been here recently, hasn't he?
what makes you say that?
a man of his taste, I'm sure he has an appreciation for history.
as do I.
may I? - Be my guest.
king's crown
tavern once frequented by George Washington,Now long buried under water street
fascinating.
I get the message.
what's up, Peter?
how did your chat go with Ms. Quinn?
I didn't find anything on Keller.
you think he finished the forgery?
maybe. Look, I don't know.
did you find anything on your end?
I might know why he's running this scam,And it's got nothing to do with you.
am I supposed to feel relieved?
I would be, I contacted interpol.
their sources say he's got a big bull's-eye on his back.
yeah? - Yeah.
that stockholm heist he pulled?
it was bankrolled with russian mob money.
seems the comrades got a little upset When he skipped europe without giving them their cut.
if they catch him now, they'll kill him.
unless he promised the russians their money back and then some.
he's gonna pay off his debt with the money from the bottle.
I want you here first thing in the morning.
I want to find keller before they do.
me too.
see you got my postcards.
thanks for keeping in touch.
we never did get to finish our game.
aren't you curious to see who wins?
not anymore.
manuel Campos died today.
I'm sorry -- who?
your thief.
he had a wife.
still afraid to get dirty, huh, caffrey?
violence requires no imagination.
anyone can use a gun or a car.
that's why you'll always be second-rate
Yeah.
you're too weak to do what's necessary to get what you want.
including Kate, from what I heard.
nice try.
but you officially lost that one.
you were in prison for what, four years?
missed a lot of valentine's days.
I forgot how endearing it was when she talks in her sleep.
I should've warned you, but we're, uh...
at the edge of your leash here.
might want to taket easy.
imagine how I felt
when I discovered that you, of all people,
were working for the feds.
I step forward, and a dozen FBI agents Will be here in minutes.
that right? Be my guest.
only one they'd have sufficient cause to arrest is you.
Really? - Yeah.
trespassing? Ugh. Come on, neal.
you're clutching at straws here.
they got al capone on tax evasion.
you flatter me with the comparison.
what do you want?
I want to play the game.
the Franklin bottle?
Yeah. I want to know who's the best.
you already submitted yours for the auction.
guess you won.
you never could follow through, Caffrey.
that's why Kate went looking for something else.
I'll give you the first piece.
now let's play the game.
you got 10 days.
what is this?
a challenge.
okay, where'd you get it?
Keller. He wants a face-off.
gave me the first piece to forge my own franklin bottle.
awfully sporting of him.
well, not exactly.
gave himself a big head start.
why do I get the feeling this isn't about the bottle?
it's about kate.
it always was between you and Keller.
like he ever had a chance.
it doesn't matter what it was about. Keller killed a man.
Oh, sure, sure. Now you're the noble warrior.
okay, what's the plan?
I'm gonna beat him.
he gave me the bottle.
now we need to fill it, cork it, seal it, and label it.
you like scavenger hunts?
I've been known to uncover an easter egg or two in my time.
what's on the list?
you saw Keller. - I did.
I could've taken him down
on what, exactly?
he's completely clean. That's how he works.
doesn't take away the fact that you should've cleared it with me first.
you're right. I should've.
you should've.
weatherby's received Keller's bottle this morning.
Wow. It's good.
Yeah. It's also our only piece of evidence Linking keller to campos's murder.
and it's locked in a vault. Might as well be at the bottom of the atlantic ocean.
considering how circumstantial all of this is.
I'm assuming a takeout menu won't fly this time?
Nope.
unless we can convince them it's a fake.
that cattigan guy won't stop the auction Just because we claim it's a fake.
and we need proof that it is.
we can submit a Franklin bottle of our own.
there's only one bottle in existence, right?
if I turn in a fake that's just as good as Keller's, They'll have to test them both.
what kind of test?
standard stuff - carbon-date the cork,
run a molecular test on the wax,
spectroscopic refraction on the glass.
stuff they got from the museum heist. - Right.
his bottle will pass those, and so will mine.
that'll force the auction house to run a cesium test.
they don't like to run them because they're so expensive,
but it's a way to determine the age Of the wine inside the bottle without opening it.
cesium 137 doesn't exist in nature.
after they detonated the first atomic bomb, It spread around the world.
anything that was bottled before 1945
like the real Franklin bottle
right -- is cesium free.
if keller's bottle has it, it's a fake.
why can't I just get some 100-year-old wine and fill it up?
there's the rub. They'd know you just added it
because the oxygen content would be too high,
and that's why it can't be forged.
and you think you can beat this cesium test?
no. Nobody can. It's impossible.
and that's the beauty of it.
you force the test. You both fail.
it proves that keller's bottle's a counterfeit.
we got him on fraud.
it's not murder, but it's a start.
how you gonna put the bottle together?
already got a man on it.
how's it coming?
overreact much?
what are you gonna do with tweezers?
the shinobi ninja can fashion a weapon out of anything.
you're not a ninja. That's exactly what I want you to believe.
how's the bottle coming?
Oh, I,uh, paid off a guard at that maritime exhibit.
for french cork made before the industrial revolution.
we got our newspaper.
what is this -- a New York gazette from 1785?
they use it for insulation in the walls At the colonial alehouse.
that's perfect.
there's only one egg missing from our basket.
wax.
preferably 18th-century beeswax.
from the chteau Du Munn vineyard.
grace -- Keller's broker
has a few chteau dDu Munn in her vault.
how much wax do we need? - Not much.
I can make it work with just a few shavings.
how's the security there?
good.
keypad with a rotating code,
biometric scanner plate
with pulse monitor.
that makes it trickier.
so, how do you get in?
have her open the door.
for you?
no.
for my client -- Carlton Leed.
who's that?
no.
that's your favorite word, isn't it?
it's a classic -- "nope," "never," "forget about it."
what makes you think I would break into any place with you And steal anything?
no, we are not breaking in. You'll be shown around.
and we're not stealing anything of value.
all I need are some wax shavings.
it's like taking a lock of hair from the floor of a barbershop.
theft is theft.
I'm a informant ,I not an agent. I don't have the same restrictions.
we can call this one a gray area.
nada. - Come on.
you can get all dressed up, hobnob with pretty people,
drink a fine glass of port.
from everything you know about me,What makes you think I'd enjoy any of what you just said?
because this is about catching a killer.
a wax shaving for a murderer.
this won't affect the value of anything in Grace's collection?
Nope. No. Nada.
and for the record, I hate port. It's syrupy.
there will be other options.
I still say this tie is ridiculous.
it's Italian. And it looks good.
well, I feel like I should be flossing my teeth with it,
not wearing it around my neck.
all right, the sooner we can get Grace to show us the cellar,
the sooner you can get back to your favorite pair of sweatpants.
now, I know wine isn't your thing.
it's a tasting, Neal.
you nose a bottle, take a sip, and say something pretentious like,"rich,"" with nice body."
speaking of you made it. You must be Mr. Leed
please, call me carlton.
I hear you're a man of discriminating taste.
I hope we find something to your liking today.
love your tie.
she loves the tie. - Yeah.
we'll be starting with a 1985 chteau ptrus pomerol.
great year. You're not holding back.
what do you think?
I'd say it's, uh, woodsy,
with a medium body and a hint of.
the lady asked what I thought.
the use of wood is evident in its broadness of flavors.
great persistence in the mouth.
it opens up well in the glass.
I would agree.
I understand you have a more substantial private collection?
would you care to see the vault?
your friend's not coming?
uh, no, I don't need a babysitter.
please, allow me.
and you're a gentleman, too.
as you can see, our security system is state-of-the-art.
Really?
would you like to try something else?
I'd love some. Thank you.
there you are.
chteau Du Munn, post-French revolution.
ms. Quinn, I have a question about the chteau ptrus.
sorry to interrupt.
Mm. Please. Don't I know you?
I don't think so.
I guess you just have one of them faces, huh?
mind filling this up for me?
of course. - Thank you.
now I got it.
Yeah, I saw you earlier.
you, uh, came in with your friend.
Where'd he get off to, anyway?
I don't know. I'm not his keeper.
you're not, huh?
see, I think you are.
and now I'm wondering what would happen
if I ask the security guard to check the vault...
right now.
I mean, I'm wondering what that does to a lawman's career,
when his errand boy gets caught Breaking into somebody's private property?
and I'm having a hard time figuring out Why I don't book you for murder one...
right now.
is that right?
Yeah.
how about I get Grace to lock this vault down?
what are the cops gonna find when they look inside?
cellar full of dusty, overpriced wine.
you know what? I'm glad you brought in the fbi, caffrey.
makes it exciting, right?
be that much richer when I beat you.
Oh, I forgot to tell you - he's a big fan of himself.
I noticed that.
by the way, I heard that somebody mowed down a citizen
right in front of an fbi agent?
what a shame.
that's got to be embarrassing for the bureau, right?
good luck with that investigation.
I spent five minutes with the guy.
I want to punch him right in the face.
imagine how I feel.
you'll feel better when we take him down.
this can't be good.
why does everyone say that when I walk into their office?
so, you have good news? - No.
I contacted the auction house.
they're closed to new entries.
closed? We can't submit our bottle?
sorry, Peter.
now, quit the fool's errands and catch this guy.
you've outdone yourself, Moz.
flatterer. What's next?
I set up the vacuum pumps and transfer the wine.
expecting someone?
Keller, maybe?
no.
Peter. Hey. What are you doing here?
got some bad news.
the auction house is closed to new entries.
besides, while I appreciate your a-team run here, guys,
but I can't let you take your bottle to weatherby's.
it's Hughes. He pulled the plug.
if we don't, they won't run the cesium test.
Keller will get away with a half-million dollars And probably murder.
what if he wins? Or worse, what if you win?
this guy will stop at nothing.
that's why we have to stop him.
no offense, but your team...
hasn't.
you're right.
keep going. Let's take him down.
finish?
lactose.
see you in the morning.
I'll call Jones And figure out a way to get this bottle into the auction.
let's go, Hversham.
morning, Peter. - Morning.
I got nothing on the auction house.
weatherby's looks pretty damn legit.
damn.
we need some kind of leverage So Cattigan will let our bottle in.
Keller really got to you, huh?
Yeah, he's a piece of work.
he and neal may be rivals, but he's the anti-Caffrey, The bizarro Neal.
what, you got something?
Yeah.
Yeah, they had lousy weather in France this summer
couple of blazing-hot months.
the grape harvest came up short.
that's good?
Yeah.
1947 was not a good year.
40000
$45, 000. Thank you very much.
$50, 000. Thank you, sir.
$50, 000 with the gentleman on my right. $50, 000.
55000
$55, 000 with the lady in the bk.
55000
55000
$60, 000. Thank you, sir.
I see European nobles and a handful of hedge-fund managers,
but no sign of your buddy Keller.
it's hard to arrest him on fraud if he doesn't show up.
Keller wouldn't miss the chance To see my face when this goes down.
he must be watching.
so, he could be anywhere.
no, he'll be nearby, Just in case anything goes wrong.
doesn't help us much.
you think we can get this into the auction?
I have a move up my sleeve.
I'm sorry, I can't submit your bottle
since clearly it has to be counterfeit.
one of them has to be.
how do you know it's not yours?
we have reason to believe this is the real bottle.
where did you get it?
we're not at liberty to say.
I won't admit it to the auction.
you sure about that?
last year, you sold six magnums
of chteau lafleur, 1947, at about $50, 000 a bottle.
that's public record.
I talked to the vineyard.
they only produced five magnums that year.
you don't want people knowing you got scammed, do you?
bad for business.
I guess you'll have to test them both to find out.
I can't. It will take at least three hours. The auction can wait three hours.
my client welcomes the challenge.
figured he might.
Oh, while we wait, why don't you give me the I. P. Addresses
of everyone watching on your internet feed?
Thanks.
Hey, boss. How's it going?
they're running the test now.
Congrats. - Yeah, not celebrating yet.
how's it going in there?
we're tracing those I. P.
any hits?
three locations -- the Carlyle, the ppeninsula,And a parking garage.
who'd be watching from a parking garage?
somebody who wants to be on the move.
send units to the hotels,
but put the bulk of our guys on the parking garage.
they're about to announce the results of the test.
we're about to move on keller.
sounds like "checkmate" to me.
thank you again for your patience.
we apologize for the delay, but as some of you are aware,
we have had to conduct a cesium test
to verify the authenticity
of the two bottles we have been presented with.
the test shows that one of the bottles is a forgery.
one of the bottles?
the other, represented by miss Grace Quinn,
is authentic.
thank you for your patience.
the bidding will commence shortly.
you said it was impossible to fake.
it is impossible.
unless he had the real bottle all along.
if Keller had the real bottle,
why would he go through all this?
why pretend to have a fake?
he wanted to drive up the price. Damn! That's it.
surround the bottle with controversy.
now everyone in here is dying to get their hands on it.
it'll go for double, even triple the price now.
which gives him more than enough money
to pay off his debt to the Russians.
and he used me to do it.
this was his plan the whole time. He is good.
we have to arrest him now.
as soon as this auction ends, he's gone.
what am I gonna arrest him on?
I mean, we have nothing on him now.
trespassing. - What?
I can't believe I'm gonna ask you this,
but have you seen him trespass?
I have, actually, at a construction site.
it had a "no trespassing" sign and everything.
all right, we may not be able to hold him for long,
but finding keller's gonna take a bit.
all right, well, I'll stall until you can get him.
nothing -- illegal, I know.
yo.
Hey, moz, it's me.
is the auction over?
no. I just stepped outside.
so, how's it going? Not good.
Keller's bottle is real.
he has the real bottle?
you're kidding me. - Nope.
then why?
to drive the price up.
brilliant. And we took the bait.
did they test both bottles? - Yep.
how did our bottle do?
passed every test except the cesium.
you did great, moz. Now, focus. I need your help.
we can still nail this guy.
on what?
I'll tell you later. We got to find him first.
remember how I told you keller had a debt to the russians?
of course. I have perfect recall.
well, I'm trying to stall the bidding.
Keller's gonna want to pay these guys off as soon as possible.
which must mean that they're in town somewhere.
exactly.
I'll ask around. - Yeah, well, do it fast.
if you find anything, meet me at Weatherby's.
I'll leave a pass for you at the front.
anything? - Signal's coming from the northwest corner of the garage.
we've sealed off every entrance and exit.
all right, good.
we're doing a floor-by-floor search, people, starting now.
I want everyone prepared. This guy could be armed.
nobody gets out.
I must say, it appears this spot of intrigue
has whetted appetites.
so, without further ado,
we'll open the bidding at $100, 000.
what did you find out?
I did follow-up on your suit's intel.
turns out, the russians are indeed after keller.
they want their money now.
and Sergei himself is in town.
he wants personal assurance from Keller.
that he's gonna get paid the moment this auction is done.
I got an idea.
anything? - No, nothing yet.
clear. - Clear over here.
damn it. All right, next floor. Let's move.
$375, 000, ladies and gentlemen.
$375, 000 from the gentleman on my right.
$400, 000 on the phone.
do I hear $425, 000?
no one inside. - Look at this.
son of a bitch must have seen us coming.
he's not here.
security cameras have him fleeing the scene.
he hot-wired another car
two minutes before we cordoned off the building.
so, you have no idea where he is?
we're pulling surveillance on him now with traffic cams.
putting together a timeline. Couldn't have gotten far.
didn't have time to take any of his things with him.
his things?
Yeah, he had a laptop he'd been monitoring the auction from.
he's not watching the auction anymore?
probably not.
too concerned with getting the hell out of here.
all right, find out where he's headed.
the bidding is now $800, 000
to the gentleman on my right.
this is a lousy idea.
do it, Moz.
these people don't take I. O.U.
fair warning , I can sell for $800, 000.
do it!
$1 million!
thank you, sir.
$1 million...
and sold!
what did you get us into?
Peter, where are you?
still in the garage.
what happened?
I won the bid. What?!
don't worry. I got a plan.
you usually do.
what's the status on Keller?
headquarters is monitoring his movement in real time.
from traffic cams.
looks like he's headed south on Park.
south on Park. Thanks.
I know where Keller's going.
Bravo, Keller.
seriously.
Wow. So, you came by to see me off, huh, Caffrey?
who knew you were such a gracious loser?
I have to admit,Using the real ben franklin bottle.
did not see that coming.
stroke of genius, really.
Thanks. Actually means a lot coming from you.
only wish Kate was around to see it.
I mean, we both know, she always loved a winner, right?
who knows?
maybe I'll look her up, see if she still does.
so, I'm curious.
how'd you find me?
checked sergei's travel plans.
see he does it in style. Hmm.
I also hear he doesn't take it lightly
when someone owes him money.
owed.
as in past tense.
Hey, see, our little go-round with the bottle.
cleared my debts.
in fact, I just got a text from my broker
bottle went for seven figures.
Wow! Wow, congratulations.
thank you, thank you. - Yeah, yeah.
so, it was a two-birds, one-stone thing?
humiliate me, turn a hefty profit while you're at it?
See,Now you're catching on, Neal.
listen, I'd love to chat, buddy.
but unless you got anything else,
I should get going, all right?
be good.
I haven't made my offer yet.
this should be good.
I'd like to offer you the opportunity
to make a full confession for your crimes.
the robbery of the natural history museum,
the murder of manuel campos,
anything else you want to add in.
you know what? I was wrong.
this isn't good. This is sad, man.
this is a moment I'll cherish
seeing you at your most desperate.
the winner of the franklin bottle it wouldn't happen to be bidder number 57, would it?
Why?
now, this is just awkward,
but I don't have a million dollars.
luckily, the auction house said they'd give me a week
to put the money together.
a week, huh?
know what? A week's not that long.
I can buy that.
did you tell him I'm launching
a full-blown federal investigation on the bottle?
Oh, yeah. Yeah. There's that, too.
how long can a federal investigation go on for?
not sure. Years.
Oh, years. Wow.
you son of a bitch.
how patient are Sergei and your Russian friends?
you could take a helicopter ride and find out.
or you can come with us. Your choice.
well played.
good game, Keller.
game ain't over.
help this gentleman into the car.
looks that way to me.
yeah?
I mean, you were locked up, broke out.
maybe it's my turn to accept the challenge.
best two out of three.
I'll see you around, Caffrey.
I'm counting the days.
guess Sergei's going home empty-handed.
did I miss Keller?
damn. I wanted to see him do the perp walk.
sorry.
good news is he won't be bothering us for a while.
how long is "a while"?
maybe long enough to finish our chess game.
think they have a prison that can hold him?
I don't know.
okay, so, what's the bad news?
you won't be drinking a million-dollar bottle of wine tonight.
I'll live.
you were right.
I could use one less mystery in my life.
Oh, I rescind that comment.
there's suddenly been a lot of chatter about the music box.
you need to talk to Alex.
she won't tell me anything while I work for the FBI.
then make it worth her while.
how you doing today, sir?
well, thanks.
thank you.
I hope you're not admiring your own work.
I wish i was. But i got a pretty good alibi.
I was working with you yesterday.
I'll be sure to back you up when we talk to the Lamson gallery.
the curator is waiting for us upstairs.
I love a good art heist.
solving a good art heist.
that's what i said.
let me see that.
Lewis thayer's "untitled #2.
it's worth $4 million.
you'd think for that kind of money he'd have bothered to come up with a title.
it is one of his seminal pieces.
is it a fad or talent that drives up the price?
both. Neither. Don't try to understand the peculiarities of the pop-art market.
would you pay $4 million for that?
pay? - Yeah.
you're the wrong guy to ask.
miss Jeffries, I'm special agent Burke.
this is Neal Caffrey. - How you doing?
tell us what happened.
well, as you can see, the "untitled #2" was simply cut out of its frame.
how does someone pull a down-and-dirty slash and grab from a major gallery?
it's one of the few options left if you want to knock over a high-security
I was talking to her.
Mr. Caffrey's right.
we have sensors in the frame, but nothing attached to the canvas.
cutting it out of the frame circumvents the alarms.
got it.
security cameras?
the theft occurred during our daily security-tape swap.
so we're not dealing with complete amateurs.
no. Actually, it sounds like a pretty good plan.
what are the odds you'll be able to recover the painting?
well, it would have made my job a lot easier if you had kept it from the press.
we did.
somebody didn't.
anonymous tip.
do we think our thieves called it in?
good chance.
headlines attract black-market buyers.
which means they want to move the painting quickly.
I can ask around. - Good. Run your street contacts.
Diana, you've got Europe. Check with interpol.
Jones, you're on Asia.
check with the alat over there.
Yep.
what? - Do you mind?
I need to check my street contacts.
calling Mozzie?
he's good at this kind of thing. - You sure he didn't do it?
slash and grab.
frame's too high.
Yeah.
Hello?
Hey, moz, the Lamson is missing a thayer.
I didn't steal it.
I know. - Reward?
sizable.
all right. I'm on it.
what are you doing here? I said meet me in an hour.
and you found a source in less than an hour.
that's pretty quick, Moz.
I only deal with professionals.
and you asked about a reward, which you never ask about.
so i'm starting to think you're talking to somebody else and not telling me.
you're paranoid. - Who's your fence, Moz?
I'm friends with many people of unsavory character.
how long you been talking to her?
I know not of who you speak.
sorry. Meeting aborted. My sources spook easily.
they have to think i'm a vault.
meeting aborted!
sounds like the meeting's still on.
I can't believe i'm saying this.
I saw a mockingbird in the park.
what color was the mockingbird?
the bird died. Let's go.
what are you doing here, Alex?
I've never known you to go skulking around after reward money.
well, after the plane blew up, a lot of people were asking questions.
I'm trying to stay off the radar. Makes it hard to find work.
you came to Mozzie, not to me?
he's not tethered to the FBI.
two taps meant "abort," by the way.
or you could have just yelled "abort'.
I found the missing thayer painting. It was fenced in Dubai.
Thanks.
but you didn't come all this way just to say that. What are you really doing here, Alex?
I needed to talk to mozzie.
alone.
what did i do? - We'll talk.
we're not friends anymore?
what's up, Peter? - Got news about the painting.
meet me in the office.
on my way.
got to go back to the office. We'll talk later.
what are we talking about?
I've got a big problem.
Yeah.
great, great. Overnight it.
I found the painting.
how did you find it? I found it.
where? - It was fenced to a textile magnate in Dubai.
a hotel heiress in budapest just turned hers in.
good news. - You found the painting overseas.
scotland yard has it.
it's also in dubai and budapest. - What?
they're forgeries. - All of them? How do you know?
because customs clamps down when a theft occurs.
the risks of getting the original out are too high.
but if you make forgeries ahead of time and take them out of the country before the heist, you're in the clear.
steal the thayer, leak the theft to the press, then sell the forgeries.
and the original never leaves the country.
you've seen this scam before?
I know someone who -- allegedly pulled it off before.
we have a copycat on our hands.
who are they copycatting?
me.
- Yes. All of them.
I don't think our forger went off a photograph.
I think they stood in front of the original when they painted these.
how do you know that?
Thayer used the "ben-day dots" method to show shading.
he spread paint across a paper stencil and pushed it against the canvas with a brush.
the shadowing in these paintings is more deliberate.
it's minute, but these dots grow starker at the bottom.
the forger probably started these in afternoon light, when the color was slightly more red.
they also didn't realize they caught the painting when the light was pouring directly down on it, causing a deeper contrast at the bottom.
there's no lighting overhead.
was this painting ever hanging below that skylight?
Yes. In late April.
we had a pop-art show.
we wanted to display the thayer prominently.
then we should check the registration log for april.
probably looking for a student -- talented but still experimenting with technique.
someone like Justin Magary from east side university.
he stopped by on the 21st of april at 1: 45.
that would be afternoon light.
what's that on your face?
I haven't seen you this happy in a while.
you know, it's a beautiful day.
you're excited someone's copycatting you.
imitation, flattery -- you know what they say.
you ever been on a campus?
not as a student.
and yet you have three MBAs and two doctorates.
clearly something wrong with the system.
too bad you faked it.
they could have made copies of you and filled up a frat house.
Oh, are we bitter we weren't invited to the party?
Oh, it's just with my father's construction salary, i had to stick to the grindstone.
four years of advanced math on scholarship, then two years of accounting.
I still can't imagine you hunched over a desk with a little visor, doing my taxes.
you're lucky the FBI hires mathletes.
I was not a mathlete.
I was an athlete who was good at math.
Yeah. We fraternity guys call you "nerds."
so, why'd you forgo school and go to New York?
sorry, but we're here to interrogate someone else.
see what you missed out on?
I'm reconsidering my position on college.
focus.
Justin magary? - Yes?
we need to talk to you.
Why?
what do you know about lewis thayer's "untitled #2"?
Uh...nothing.
I mean, i know it, of course.
you ever painted one?
it's a good question.
I probably shouldn't say anything.
we've got you on a camera sketching it at the lamson gallery in april.
that's legal, right?
not when three of your copies are fenced as the real thing.
that turns them into forgeries,Which is illegal.
I can vouch for that.
it's looking pretty bad for you, kid.
if you talk to me, i can help you.
a while ago, i answered an ad on the school's list server for reproductions.
I get an e-mail back commissioning seven copies of "untitled #2.
seven? Did you wonder why somebody would want seven copies?
you know how hard it is to make money as an art student doing art?
who hired you?
I didn't meet them. They dropped the materials off in my mailbox.
and once i'd finished, they said to leave the paintings in the rec center and that the money would be left in my box again.
I thought it was weird that they didn't want to meet, - so i -- so you stayed and watched the pick-up?
Yeah.
I wanted to make sure it was legit. And she seemed normal, so i let it go.
all right, if you sat down with a sketch artist, do you think you could remember what she looked like?
may i? - Yeah.
this is her.
my fault?! It's your fault!
this would never have happened if you kept a lower profile!
that's why i work in code.
anything i can do? - I don't need your help.
she needs your help.
Alex? - Someone's looking for her.
who?
she thinks it has something to do with the music box. - Why?
well, she thinks -- Just let her talk.
I don't know who, but they've got a powerful reach, and they've turned over a lot of stones.
all right, what can i do?
Krugerrands?
I needed the money to disappear.
I hooked her up with someone who deals in krugerrands.
I've been fencing some in increments.
who's the guy?
old friend from Detroit.
some friend?russell found out someone's looking for me, and now he's gonna sell me out.
I need you to shut him up.
short of killing him, i'm open to ideas.
all right.
give me some time. I'll figure something out.
you know i won't let anything happen to you.
Thanks.
she comes to you and not to me?
far be it for me to act as therapist, but maybe Alex doesn't want to see you heartbroken over kate.
or maybe it's the tracking anklet.
sure, the anklet.
found our girl.
Justin's got talent.
if ever we're short a sketch artist, i know who to call.
who is she? - Veronica Naylon.
did she send the e-mail?- Can't be sure.
the account's defunct, and the address was generic.
both the ad and e-mail account were created at the school computer lab, so anyone could have done it.
here's her work-up.
junior, majoring in archaeology, mediocre grades, no priors.
how does an average 21-year-old student from the upper east side pull this off?
you think she has accomplices?
maybe this is where she met them.
she's an archaeology major, but she's currently acing a criminology class.
it's the one class she's pulling an "a."
how appropriate.
Oh, if you like that, you'll love this -- syllabus for the class.
he's gonna be impossible after this.
Where's Neal?
Oh, look at you.
you'd think being copycatted was like winning the crime oscar.
what? I'm not allowed to revel?
all right, take me through your version of this scam.
how many players are involved?
you'd need a forger, a thief, and a couple fences.
not the kind of thing you'd pull off by yourself?
not unless you can be in multiple places at once.
I mean, it's a sophisticated job. I doubt Justin or our mystery girl thought of it themselves.
no, but they might have figured it out by studying you.
our mystery girl, Veronica -- she's acing a criminology class.
here's the syllabus.
they spent a week on me?
apparently you're one of the interesting criminals of the 21st century.
a new breed of forger, technological virtuoso.
with a classical artistic foundation.they got it.
Yeah, yeah. I read it.
Oh, they covered the Antioch manuscripts. Did you see that?
Yeah, i know. Relax. They only covered you for a week.
by the end of the year, they probably won't remember your name.
well, obviously, a few of them will.
you think she formed a crew in this class?
people have been known to fall for a pretty face.
if Veronica had help, i don't want to scare them away by my talking to her just yet.
well, i can talk to her. - Now you're reading my mind.
anklet?
I'll pull it for this one. You ready to go back to school?
I think i can handle that.
good. - Cause i'm a technological virtuoso.
okay.
with a classical artistic foundation.
okay, okay. Read it to yourself. Quiet now.
did you guys see this syllabus?
Oh, we don't need to share. - I'm in it.
Yep. Go, team!
the Koechert diamond pearl was stolen by gerald Blanchard in 1998.
it took them a full two weeks to realize that the jewel was missing because Blanchard replaced it with a pretty darn good costume replica.
he circumvented the alarms at the viennese castle by parachuting onto the roof, if you can believe it or not.
some people have called this the perfect crime.
I wouldn't say he was perfect.
and Blanchard overshot his landing.
he, uh, slipped on the tiles but saved himself by grabbing a railing on the castle's roof.
so i'd say he loses marks for style.
excuse me,I believe we have a celebrity in our midst.
this is Mr. Neal Caffrey.
to what do we owe the honor, sir?
I understand you study the best criminals.
I share that interest.
you , you seem like a very capable teacher.
Oh, please.
you know, you would be a far bettert,Hey, why don't you
could you come up here and answer some ques
class, wouldn't you love to have Neal Caffrey up here, teaching?
come on.
we would love to have some of your expertise.
pleasure to have you. - Pleasure to be here.
please...
all right, well, we'll stick to the hypotheticals and anything covered by the statute of limitations.
who's first?
all right.
how about you?
there's not much written about your arrest.
how'd you get caught?
momentary lapse in concentration.
so the FBI had nothing to with it?
Oh, they'd like to take credit for it, but essentially, i turned myself in.
recently, you were suspected in the la joyau diamond heist , suspected and then cleared.
I served my four years, and i decided i didn't want to go back.
been living like all you ever since then.
or trying to.
okay. Let's thank mr. Neal Caffrey.
thank you.
remember, everybody, read chapters 12 through 15 of lovell for next week.
thank you so much, Mr. Caffrey.
fascinating. It's the least i could do.
you know, i thought i should participate in my own copyright infringement.
excuse me?
it's a little green to rip off someone's con unless you improve it.
you and your kids could use a little tutoring.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what you're talking about.
the Thayer theft.
Hey, don't get me wrong, man. I'm flattered.
but, uh... I'd like to be cut in.
you know, i did lay the groundwork.
well, i'm sorry to disappoint you, but i'm a professor who teaches crime.
I don't go out there and commit them.
okay.
Mr. Caffrey...
Yeah, you got some bright kids in here.
Yeah, there's a few of them.
we go to a bar called the globe, around the corner.
be thrilled if you would join us. - The Globe?
Yeah. - I'll think about that.
I think you might find it interesting.
have a great day. - Thank you.
and thanks again.
thank you.
so the FBI had nothing to with it?
Oh, they'd like to take credit for it, but essentially, i turned myself in.
think we've heard enough.
suddenly i don't feel bad about telling you this.
you're not the only person they've been copying.
what?
seems those who can also teach.
we cross-checked all of the crimes on professor oswald's syllabi since he started teaching 10 years ago.
we suspect he counterfeited a bank note last year, forged an emerson letter, and smuggled egyptian artifacts.
he copied Tokley-Perry?
well, felony by proxy -- you got to give him credit.
we also think that he might have stolen matisse's "view of Saint Tropez.
Matisse?
that's a serious payday.
unfortunately, this is all speculation.
Oswald is taking advantage of his students, and justin is going to go down for this unless we can prove it wasn't him.
well, we have one card left.
we know about the Thayer. Oswald's hiding it somewhere.
he's not gonna give it up soon.
Interpol found the fences who sold the forgeries abroad.
they know they're being watched. They're out of play.
so he'll need a local fence.
you have something in mind? - Maybe.
what's the FBI's policy for drinking on the job?
good. Okay, show us something else.
bet you another $20 i can drink this shot without touching that hat.
you're on.
done.
you didn't drink it. - Done.
that's not fair!
Oh, i didn't say it was fair.
I said i could drink it without touching the hat.
I'm only mildly impressed.
this is all small-time.
you guys, uh... You want something bigger?
Manny, i think i saw a $50 in your wallet. Can i have it?
Why?
you're paying with $100s, manny. I don't think you'll miss it.
just give him the $50.
Hey, where's my wallet?
how did you do that?
always make your lifts with two fingers.
that way your thumb doesn't bump up against the mark.
tell me something i don't know.
and never, never think you're the smartest guy in the room.
unless you're the smartest guy in the room.
Oh, uh, you want to keep your place in that deck?
keep the tip of your little finger in the brief.
I think i know what i'm doing.
want to pu on that?
sure.
who's the mark?
that's my $50.
how about her?
Hi, i'm eric.
Alex. Nice to meet you.
Alex, pick a card.
this looks like fun.
so, put it back on top and cut it for me, would you?
okay.
okay, now, the card i stop at is gonna be yours.
he doesn't think it will be.
he's wrong.
200 bucks says he's right.
no. I can't take your money.
why not?
you can't make bets with girls?
and that's your card.
and, no, it's not.
well, that was supposed to be your card.
now, i guess he was right.
sorry.
I believe this is her card, Eric.
she and caffrey played you.
she's his, uh,"inside man," if you will.
nice catch.
look, we weren't gonna take your money.
Yeah, right. - Check your pocket.
I guess the lesson here is never con a con man.
I think we all know what the lesson is for today, don't we, Eric?
Yeah. Yeah, i guess i'm not the smartest guy in the room.
Congratulations. You humbled him.
that's not easy to do.
I'm, uh, Professor George Oswald.
what do you do besides card tricks?
she's in the moving business.
well, nice to meet you.
if you want to join us for a drink, the next round is on eric.
nice to meet you. - Be right there.
thank you for backing me up in there.
Mozzie tells me to come to the bar because you have a plan and now i'm out 200 bucks and you're dropping my name.
do you trust me?
no.
okay, i assume we're doing more than baiting frat boys with bar tricks.
what's with the dead poets society in there?
you know, it's my current case and the solution to your problem.
Russell wants to meet on sunday to fence the rest of the krugerrands, but it's a setup.
he's gonna sell me out to whoever put the price on my head, and your plan is to bring the feds into it?
I tell the FBI that Oswald and his kids are gonna steal the krugerrands.
they'll pull Russell in and talk to him.
it will kill his reputation.
no one will be buying information off him if they think he's in bed with the bureau.
you're crazy. - It'll work.
you're crazy.
are you in or are you out?
I'm in.
the kids do the legwork.
Oswald fences the goods and kicks them back a share of the profit.
if the kids get caught Oswald can sell them out.
Yeah, he'll say he was teaching a class, and they took it too far.
he's more slippery than you are. - Thank you.
do you think you can get him to reveal the painting?
I don't know. They spent the night talking about the next best heist.
which way are they leaning?
everything from diamond heists to stealing boats.
but i think we can choose for them. - How so?
I happen to know a petty crook who's moving Krugerrands on sunday.
gold Krugerrands? Of course you do.
his name is russell smith.
bingo. Racketeering, extortion, robbery.
and i don't like him.
we intercept russell with the Krugerrands, send Jones down the street with the coins, and i get the kids to steal them from him instead.
we can watch them, follow the case back to Oswald.
tell me more about this guy. How do you know him?
he's a friend of a friend. - Mozzie?
you can convince Oswald and the kids to go after him?
I can still be slippery.
I'll get them to convince me.
if jewels are the target, what are the challenges of extraction and export?
how do we buy enough time to get the jewels out of the country?
it'd be cool to pull a blanchard
buy a replica the day before and replace it with the real thing.
we could tunnel.
I'm not really big on shovels, Manny.
would you excuse me?
everything is all set, okay?!
you can't back out now!
okay, look, keep your voice down, okay?
he saw me. It's over.
you can't walk away. I already have a buyer.
then get someone else to make the grab, or tell your buyer to back off.
so i'm out a ton of money - because you made a stupid mistake and got spotted?! - Yes.
you know, thanks for nothing, Caffrey! - What's she talking about?
I think she's talking about money.
that's good, that's good. Now walk away.
can i slap you?
I bet that hurt. - Sorry about that.
that's a little awkward.
lovers' quarrel?
we have a history. You know, we just...
we don't work well together.
sounded like a certain job went awry.
I'm reformed, remember?
Yes, of course. All right, listen, um...
I have a class to teach.
so, why don't you keep brainstorming, and, uh...
remember, in this theoretical discussion, there's no better teacher than this man here. All right?
see you all later.
you know, you can tell us.
what's your history? Former girlfriend?
something like that.
sounds like she has got a job for you, but you went and got spotted by the target.
Oh, you heard all that from over here?
well, she can be a little loud.
no, look, guys, it's just a melon drop, okay?
I'd tell you, but you'd say it was small-time.
well, what's the take? - Krugerrands.
gold.
