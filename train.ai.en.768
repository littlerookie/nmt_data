Warrick, why don't you and I take the perimeter and work our way in.
all right.
Greg, you're with us. I'll start the sketch.
how you doing, Nick? - Above ground, Wilcox.
would you like inside or out?
I'll take in.
we got two vics.
we think the girl is Selena March.
she owns the trailer.
what about the male?
nothing yet.
this is a piece of the roof right here
fiberglass and particle board.
these things weren't built to last.
they were built to burn.
this place is totaled.
my money's on meth lab. The bed's collapsed.
you know, Metcalf, just because somebody lives in a trailer park, doesn't mean they're a meth cook.
you guys are a real pain in the ass, you know that?
get used to it, pal.
I'm just having a little trouble understanding this because you...
...all live so close together. You mean none of you saw the explosion?
uh, I heard it. - Well, good.
when I came out about five minutes later, the whole place was burnin' up.
where do you live? - Right over there.
all right, let me get this straight
you heard a blast like thatcoming from your neighbor's and it took...
...you five minutes to poke your head out and see what was going on?
I was watching TV. - I'm sure he was drinking.
no, hang around, hang around. Hey, hang around.
did you find a man in Selena's trailer?
now why would you ask that? Was Selena a hooker?
I'm sure I don't know.
but one thing I do know, that's not Selena's car.
yeah?
Catherine, we have a 4-19 off Industrial.
do you mind handling it?
so you get the team back together only to break us apart again.
what kind of a perverse game are you playing here, Gil?
same one as usual. - Yeah, I'll cover it. I'm taking Warrick.
Oh, hey, guys. Good to see you.
Hey, would you tell Nick
I hope there's no hard feelings about that whole, you know, abduction thing. He hasn't returned my calls.
he's been busy.
squad car found her about a half hour ago-- no ID, but there's a lot of homeless in this area.
looks like somebody took something to her head.
didn't find a weapon, but my guys are still looking.
a shopping bag for a shirt, rubber boots and a G-string.
homeless stripper?
well, this is G-String Row, isn't it?
why is there a ring on your ring finger?
because I'm married.
what?
Congratulations.
how much did you pay her?
no, seriously, good luck with that, man. I didn't even know you had a girlfriend.
Oh, yeah, it's a girl I've been dating a couple months, Tina.
how long have you been married?
since yesterday.
did this, uh, drive-through wedding at Circus Circus Way, you know. Fun, fun time.
Hey. Sorry I'm late. Busy night.
we need a TOD, David.
Rigor's barely set, so not long. Under four hours.
about as long as Warrick's been married.
you're married?
Congratulations. - Thanks.
do you think she was dumped?
lividity is consistent with the position of the body.
so it's highly unlikely. - All right.
I'll check out the strip clubs. - I'll go with you.
well, there doesn't seem to be any drug-manufacturing supplies, but plenty of ignition sources: a hot plate, fondue pot, gas stove, candles.
one leaky pipe's all it takes.
which I haven't found yet.
Yeah, but even if you had, that would only explain the explosion in here, not the ruptured gas main outside.
think I can help you with that.
I found this gas meter over by the main.
trailer blows, this thing becomes a missile.
one explosion leads to another.
Yeah, but where did it all start?
brass ran the plates on that Acura near the trailer.
it's registered to a Robert Durgee.
you get his photo from the DMV?
confirmed as the vic-- Henderson address, mortgage broker.
wife's name was on the insurance card.
she coming in? - She wasn't home.
brass is tracking her down.
excuse me, Mr. Grissom...
an officer brought this in off a call from Flora Nevada Nursery.
they thought it might have something to do with the Walter Gordon case.
female's lungs were filled with soot.
cod is smoke inhalation.
okay, that means the natural gas didn't suffocate her.
explosion probably knocked her out before the fire even started.
Yeah, male didn't even last that long.
his lungs were clean, but he suffered fatal crushing injuries to his abdomen.
the pieces of debris that were on this guy's body were not heavy.
but the bed he was lying in collapsed. - Explosion could've done that.
let's photo-enhance these bruises.
Yeah, yeah, the UV light's definitely bringing out the bruises underneath the skin.
that looks like a tire mark.
maybe our gas explosion just turned into a hit-and-run.
well, Robert said that he was going to be working late.
so I ...went to midnight bingo.
alone?
excuse me?
alone?
I was...
with a friend.
what was your friend's name?
Why?
why not?
he's married.
looks like the only person in this thing who isn't married...
...is the dead girl in the trailer with your husband.
you didn't know he was having an affair?
no, I had no idea.
you have a '96 blue Ford Ranger.
we're going to need to take a look at it.
but my truck is in New Mexico.
my brother borrowed it this morning, he, uh...
a wild guess: you have no idea how to reach him.
not until he gets back.
why do you need to see my truck?
let me tell you a story.
once upon a time, you follow your husband to a trailer park.
you see him slumming with his little trailer bunny.
you waited for him to come out...
when she pulls the body back in, before she can call for help, you torch the place. Kaboom.
the end.
that is the craziest thing I've ever heard.
wouldn't even make my top ten.
so that's when the bereaved Mrs. Durgee lawyered up.
Broadcast's out on her truck, and the warrant's ready to go.
I don't care what he says.
put him in the tank and see if he wises up.
sure as hell can't get any dumber.
detective Curtis.
Grissom.
I thought you were supposed to be arresting people in Boulder City.
well, a spot opened up here and... I transferred in today.
surprise.
well, your mother would be proud.
my mother made Captain.
you know, I'd just qualified for my shield when the sheriff...
...pulled my papers and "volunteered" me to CSI.
I think my mom hated that more than I did.
you won't miss the lab, will you?
there's some things I'll miss.
I'll see you around.
so, Vartann and I struck out on G-String Row.
you poor guys.
Yeah, right.
you know what I mean. No one recognized the victim's picture.
listen, Cath, about this whole - marriage thing... - Yeah, that.
Yeah, that kind of threw me for a loop.
Tina, right?
Yeah.
she must be a very special woman. I look forward to meeting her.
Yes, she... - The vic's blood-alcohol level was . 16
and COD was blunt-force trauma.
smashed and then smashed, huh?
any luck on the, uh... victim's prints?
no work card, no record.
but the rubber boots were standard-issue Streets and Sanitation.
Yeah, there's three S&S workers with those initials.
and it looks like an Eddie Vonner was on duty last night.
why would you want to see my boots?
you tell us.
look, I know it's against the regs to pick...
up anything other than trash, but, I mean, come on.
she was barefoot; she was stepping on glass and crap, so, yeah, I gave her my boots. And she practically begged, so,
I gave her a lift.
so, you're just a good Samaritan.
Oh, come on, it was pretty obvious she didn't belong there.
where? - Jefferson and K?
you ever see the citizens that hang out in that neighborhood?
when I see them, they're usually dead.
well, there you go.
I mean, come on, she... I could tell, despite the...
well, the get-up, she was hot.
and, I mean, I'm not talking like garbage truck hot.
I mean, she was like... like limo hot.
listen, did she tell you her name, or, uh, how she ended up there, anything?
she looked kind of embarrassed, so I didn't push it.
so, I just... I dropped her off down at, uh,
WESTERN and Industrial. Never left my route.
why, did she, uh...? She say anything about me?
she died a few blocks from where you dropped her off.
if the wife torched the trailer and caused the explosion, you would expect to see small debris embedded all over the inside of these walls.
there's nothing here.
Hey, hey... Sara.
check this out.
this is a piece of the exterior wall facing the road.
with a tire mark on it? - Yeah.
there is blue paint on this gas main.
didn't mean anything at the time.
amber has a blue Ford Ranger, right?
what if Amber follows her husband to trailer, sees him go inside, totally freaks out.
why wait for him to come out?
Yeah. Yeah, just come straight through. Run him over in bed with another chick.
trailer collapses, fire breaks out, sweeps through, and destroys practically all evidence of a collision.
it's too bad we don't have her truck.
we could match this to her tires.
Well,'96 Ford Ranger, stock paint.
maybe I can match the transfer to this.
I'm starving.
there's a uni going out for sandwiches. Would you like me to get you something?
no, no, you go ahead. I'm gonna work on this.
according to the garbageman, she ran up from this direction.
yeah? - Must be where she got the bag.
victim wasn't carrying a cell phone.
she's in the wrong part of town in her underwear, scared out of her head.
she's gonna call her man, her family, someone.
and she didn't have a quarter, so she called 911.
I'll print the phones. - I'll dump the call records.
let's get the traffic cameras, too.
the, uh, tread mark on your trailer wall...
...is consistent with Michelin 195/70/R14s.
what about the blue paint scrapings we found on the gas main?
you got a real thing for blue paint. You know that?
but, uh, this isn't from a Ford Ranger, or any Ford for that matter.
it's a GMC paint.
amber Durgee was cheating on her husband, maybe even wanted him dead, but her truck didn't have anything to do with it.
right tires, wrong vehicle.
found something?
part of a headlamp, maybe.
well, I found some blue paint transfer on that chain-link fence.
as far as tracks go, this place is a parking lot, man. They're everywhere.
except between the gas main and the trailer.
so, the trailerwasn't rammed?
I think we're looking at the, uh, vehicular equivalent of a through-and-through.
car comes down the road.
gas main ...
flying car.
that's what we're gonna go with? - Okay.
the partial oem number on the headlamp piece - belongs to a'97 pontiac sunfire. - Boy, that was quick.
well, gmc paint-- tire model wasn't that tough.
I'll put out another broadcast. - All right.
your broadcast was for a blue Pontiac. Patrol figured this was worth a look.
how bad does a smell have to get before Parking Control calls Homicide?
no way this car was at the trailer park. Think we've got a new case.
first citation was issued five days ago.
car's probably been here at least six. - Six days in the summer heat.
and a trunk becomes a Crockpot.
looks like a male and a female.
that could be an entry wound in her skull.
well, if she was shot in there, there might be bullets and casing.
I say we process the car in place. Let's get rolling.
area is uncontrolled. Evidence can be contaminated or lost.
we need to get this back to the lab.
car condom.
Hi, CSI guy.
you're wondering why you're here?
because you followed the evidence. - Archie? Archie?
do you have anything on pay phone dump? - Oh. Yeah.
the 911 call about five minutes before your garbageman picked up the vic.
then I matched timecodes with the video from the traffic cam.
synched up the audio.
911. What is your emergency? - Whoa!
that's our girl.
will you tell me your location? No. I don't know where I am, okay?!
someone's getting territorial.
vic loses her shoes. Explains the boots. Let see where she came from.
rewind it a little bit,
Oh, Stop. Hold it.
that looks like an airport shuttle.
there's a logo on this side. - Yeah. I can enhance that.
that's a limo? - This is Vegas.
it's a strip bar on wheels.
I don't even pay attention to the talent.
I just drive down Industrial Boulevard, from strip club to strip club, picking 'em up.
it's like bus stops. Before you know it, we're full, the bus is on fire...
we call it the "Champagne Ride." It's nice.
so what do the girls get paid for this?
the girls, they make at least twice as much as they do in the clubs.
depending on what else they ride.
it's a pretty sweet deal for the guys.
hot chicks getting trashed with no security and nowhere to go.
and what happens when the girls want to get off?
usually, it's the guys that are getting off.
I found something in there besides body fluids.
belongs to the victim, Brooke Harris.
you dropped that girl off in a war zone, man.
when the guy paying the tab says he wants to stop, I just stop.
come on... - Stop it!
back off, jerk! - Stop the bus!
get her off the bus! - No, I don't want...
look, strippers are tough chicks, okay?
I figured she'd find a way home, one way or another.
Brooke Harris was getting calls from a gym?
well, the "Giselle" number went straight to voice mail.
the voice mail said to contact her here.
and what's the word on the husband?
the husband. - Yeah... no, according to his office, he's away in Laughlin on business. We're still trying to get in touch...
swing those legs up and around. Yeah, like a waterfall...
you got it. That's it!
so I called Brooke a few times.
so what? She was one of my students.
you actually teach this?
strippers have the best bodies in town.
if you want the body, this is how you get it.
trust me, I've been doing this since before I had my driver's license.
well, workout is one thing.
what is a housewife from Centennial Park doing on a stripper bus with pros?
she wanted it.
come on... - No, really. She loved the attention.
loved the fantasy. She wanted to try it for real.
see how she stacked up against some real talent.
and you let her - Do I look like her mother?
you were teaching her a lesson.
if I'd wanted to do that,
I would've sent her to Stripperama, fed her to the wolves.
and drunk CEOs aren't wolves?
they're worse. You know that.
that's why you kept calling her.
so you could hear all about it, right?
I was just calling to see how things went.
Oh, really?
it's starting to sound like I need a lawyer.
so I pulled all the ROs from all the '97 blue Sunfires in Nevada, one name and address just jumped out...
Randy Swansiger.
Las Vegas Police!
come on out, Randy.
walk out slowly Randy
michelin tires.
blue car.
broken headlamp.
Hey, how's it goin'?
I'm Detective Jim Brass. Remember me?
what are you guys doing?
you got a couple of DWIs on your record.
what have you got to say for yourself, Randy?
I was coming home...
been working late...
I guess I fell asleep at the wheel...
next thing I know...
crash-boom-bang!
the car still worked, so...
drain plug's probably under the carpet.
I think I found it.
technically, that makes you a cannibal.
Grissom would be proud.
Grissom would've tasted it on purpose.
it's working.
that makes 34 prints.
Jacqui's going to love me.
you got something?
I think so...
bullet fragment.
Copper-jacketed.
rules out a . 22.
see, it was worth it.
you better get ready for this because this is going to blow you away.
the rust-colored material you found on the victim's head wound... was rust.
case breaker?
no?
as they say, "garbage in, garbage out.
um... the Champagne Ride picks up strippers...
...near the clubs, but not actually at the clubs.
right. The owners don't like that bus coming anywhere near the clubs...
...because they don't make any money off them.
well, look,
Brooke Harris wasn't planning to die that night.
she had to have parked her car somewhere.
well, there's a secured parking lot not too far from where the garbageman dropped her off.
so, if she parked her car here...
why did she go here?
Hey, Catherine...
yes?
can we talk? About this?
sure.
you know, what happened to Nick...
it just got me thinking.
life is so short, you know?
it's almost...
it's almost shorter than we want to ever believe.
live for the day. - Exactly.
so, I,uh...
I've been heading to ask this young lady
I've been seeing, Tina, to marry me.
you know that I'm happy for you. - Yeah?
Yeah.
but it also feels like you're not so happy for me.
Warrick...
you know, the thing that makes a fantasy great is the possibility that it might come true.
and when you lose that possibility...
it just kind of sucks.
okay, Mr. Greg, your most likely match is a . 44 round recovered from a drug-related shoot-out in Mesquite five days ago. Case is still open.
that's roughly two days after the bodies ended upin the trunk.
maybe our vics were the beginning of a little crime spree.
Thanks.
I ran the Grand Am's VIN. Last RO was a tow yard over by Nellis.
vehicle's most likely an impound, sold under the table to some scammer who faked his tags.
you're not going to get far in that direction - I know.
what about prints? 13 different IDs.
some off work cards, some off felonies ranging from assault, B&E, cocaine trafficking.
well, even if I do manage to track them all down, there's no guarantee any of these were involved with the vics.
well, they didn't put themselves in the trunk, and unless they were shot right there at the curb, somebody drove the car there. You're the detective.
go detect.
fully developed skeletal structure consistent with an adult male.
the medial end of the clavicle's almost fused.
suggests he's about 25 years old.
lack of prognathism indicates he's Caucasian.
the female, however, is prognathic...
and that suggests Negroid.
unfused epiphysial ends make her a teenager.
white male, younger black female... racially motivated?
could be a Son of Sam thing.
summertime, couple on a date, making out in the car.
berkowitz used a . 44.
gunshot wounds are most likely COD for both.
female shows an entry wound at the rear of the skull.
exit wound took off most of her face.
male has no exit wound, but the entry wound...
is pretty obvious.
bullet never left the skull.
that would explain the bullet fragments.
what we need are IDs.
no missing persons filed for Caucasian males...
...between 20 and 30 in the last two weeks, but there are possibles for the girl.
two cases still open.
13 seems a little young.
could be a kidnapping.
the other one's 16.
this is one time it would be better to stay missing.
I also to brought, and her hairbrush.
this one's from her doctor.
other's from her dentist.
how long is it going to take you?
that's hard to say.
Mr. James, was Clara by any chance seeing an older man?
as far as I know, she wasn't seeing anybody but it wouldn't surprise me if she was.
Clara wasn't smart when it come to people, talking to any lowlife chump who'd give her the time of day.
the girl never did listen to a damn word I said.
the older man...
um... could've been someone she met at school?
did she have a part-time job?
Gooeybunz, over on El Dorado.
we found a number of half-eaten Gooeybunz in the car.
you know, Clara wasn't really that smart about her diet either, but she hated those things.
Smell'd get into her clothes.
by the time she got home, she practically ready to throw up.
you find out who did this...
you let me know. - Yeah.
according to Clara James' father,
Clara didn't eat Gooeybunz.
she didn't like them, which means it was either the killer or the male DB.
so we're looking for...
bite marks?
if we find a good impression, maybe we'll get an ID through dental records.
you got it.
and the student becomes a master.
I'm not seeing any bite marks.
me either.
it's not like they were bitten at all. More like torn apart.
check it out.
they might all be in pieces...
but they're all still here.
no one ever ate any of them.
which is kinda weird. I mean, why...
...buy all of 'em and not eat 'em?
I found this one under a passenger seat
intact, on the floor.
it escaped the carnage.
that's not frosting.
I always liked the middle part the best.
when she parks her car, she's a hot housewife.
a few hours later, she's just another freak.
it's my Mercedes, okay? I can prove it. Just give me the keys.
show me ten bucks or you ain't proving squat. - I don't have anywhere to go!
Brooke Harris probably spent ten bucks a day...
...on nonfat lattes. - Right.
she needed money to get her car back.
well, I don't see any ATMs around here.
this is a bad place to be broke.
Hey, you miss me?
rusty flakes.
Hey, Michaels, did you put this crime tape up?
Yes, sir.
Yeah, well, you missed something. There's blood on this rebar.
Where'd you find that?
I, uh... I just picked it up over there...
may I ask you a question?
do you recognize this woman?
she's a thief.
she took some money out of my hat.
Hey! Hey!
stealing's a crime.
Hey, Michaels.
think you might be able to take this man into custody?
tox confirmed that the packet in the Gooeybun contained cocaine, and one of the prints that I lifted off the Grand
am was a felony conviction for cocaine trafficking
Joey Zack, drug dealer.
seems he liked to use Gooeybunz to move his coke.
he's a nice regular customer at Gooeybunz.
he used to chat up cute Clara when he was there, sweet-talks her into a date, and they both end up dead in his bitchin' Grand Am.
well, whoever did it must've done it for the drugs.
GCMS on the melted gloves from your Grand Am.
a delicious confection of sugar, gelatin, starches, citric acid, mineral oil,
red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 1 and carnauba wax,
candy.
gummy candy.
I'm partial to Jujubes myself. Is it something I said?
probably. - Joey Zack's printwas found on the radio, which was tuned to 107 FM.
now, as far as I know, there is only one place in town where you can get gummies, a generic cheeseburger, and 107. 1 gets anything other than static.
sorry, I don't recognize him.
most of the time when people come here, it's dark.
how about this? You ever seen this car before?
no, all I remember from the last two weeks is what's playing 'cause I've seen it 8, 000 times.
killer Punch. A big draw for crap cars.
we're gonna need to talk to your employees.
Oh, come on, please. Is that really necessary?
it's a homicide investigation.
we could just call the health inspector and...
see how many code violations he has festering in that concession stand.
geez, fine, knock yourselves out.
Jerry's on tickets...
Maddox runs the projector, and Darryl's in concessions.
no. No, he quit last week. - Why?
he said he was gonna go live with his parents up in Mesquite.
guy's name is Darryl Blakeny.
small-time hood with priors for B&E and possession.
his prints were on the steering wheel of the Grand Am.
when he quit his job at the drive-in, he was in court-ordered rehab.
we figured Blakeny was one of Joey Zack's customers.
one night,
Blakeny sees his coke dealer's Grand Am at the drive-in, and the fiend snaps.
move, and you're dead! Shut up!
all right, all right, all right! - Give me the coke, Joey!
give me the coke!
do we know where he killed them?
we don't know where yet.
or why.
maybe the girl started freaking out;
maybe Blakeny's just a psycho.
anyway, uh, Blakeny tossed the bodies, and throws them in the trunk and drives home.
the street where the Grand Am was found is a block away from his last known residence.
he leaves it there collecting parking tickets, skips town, and uses the same gun two days later...
... in another drug-related crime in Mesquite.
the scumbag's still in the wind.
at least he's in the system with a double homicide.
that's not going to satisfy Clara James' father.
can she cook? Is she a good cook?
come on, Warrick. - Hey, Grissom.
we're taking Warrick to the Pepper Mill to celebrate his marriage and to condemn his elopement. You in?
did you invite your wife?
I don't think I'm ready to subject her to the crew just yet.
I got to beg off, you guys.
got to take Lindsay to school. - All right.
so? - I got one more thing to do.
all right. Don't.
so, breathe quick. Breathe slow.
put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger.
any way you like, you're going to die here.
okay? Perfect.
okay? Perfect.
how'd you know it was going to be there?
if that "okay" had been meant for Nick, it wouldn't have been in the form of a question.
I think maybe Walter Gordon had an accomplice.
perfect.
male or female?
it's, um...
hard to say. The tape was pretty mangled.
enhancement and noise cancellation increase intelligibility, but it alters timber and tone.
I don't know there's any more I can do here.
you know, Nick recorded a message on the flip side of the tape.
you think maybe we should... - No.
this is between you and me.
hotel landscaper found him.
almost hit him with his weed wacker.
he hasn't been here long, Frank.
I've got uniforms canvassing for other witnesses.
hello. Hi. Are you in charge here?
as a matter of fact, I am.
could the patrol cars park in the back?
I don't want to upset the guests.
Oh, yeah, we'll jump right on that.
who you are?
Craig Seabourn, manager of the hotel.
so, Seabourn, do you know this man?
Armando Diaz.
he's an employee here, takes care of the pool.
and someone "took care of" him.
not here.
I agree. I think he was killed somewhere else and dumped here.
told you. No way is my place involved in this.
we're a five-star hotel.
how do you explain this?
where did you find that?
I found it on his body.
it's the key to the penthouse suite.
or as we call it, the primary crime scene.
Mr. Seabourn, you are about to lose your five-star status.
welcome to Hotel Graciana.
Thanks.
can we have a quote? A comment?
could you move to your left?
no, no, camera left. Just one comment.
I'm going to ask you one more time, take that camera off my body.
the dead deserve better.
we're good to go.
then go.
you still seeing her?
no. It's... She's very pretty, so I...
could we just focus on the victim?
confirmation, he wasn't killed here.
head wounds are the second biggest bleeders next to arterial cuts, and I don't see any blood.
body's been moved. We're thinking Penthouse.
Yeah. I heard that on the news.
she didn't get it from me, okay?
Yeah, right.
the victim really looks like he's been through the ringer.
Yeah.
worst of it, looks like blunt force trauma to the head.
I'll know more at the post.
lot of white fibers in his hair.
maybe cotton?
I don't know.
I bagged some of it for you.
H said he's a pool boy.
maybe they're from towels.
question is, what's the pool boy doing in the penthouse suite?
Yeah, let's head up there.
I got paged at court, I'm out a kit.
all right the backup's in the Hummer.
Oh, great.
we'll meet you in the lobby.
Horatio?
Yeah.
dispatch says the Chief's looking for you.
did you say the Chief?
Yeah.
he mention why?
I have no idea, but he wants to talk to you, says he'll send a car for you.
huh. I'll drive myself, Frank.
a case you were working on a few years ago
the guy's up for parole. I need you to make a statement at his hearing.
and you took me off a crime scene for this, Chief?
there have been rumblings about your team.
rumblings? How do you mean?
I need an honest assessment of what these kids are up to.
okay. Our solve rate is second to none.
but one of your CSIs is an open leak to the media.
one's got money trouble, one quit her job that she was trained to do, and we're suffering for it.
so, it sounds like the brass is planning to make a surprise visit.
Yeah, I heard it at breakfast.
it could happen any time in the next eight weeks.
they're gonna be looking at character and case-handling.
chief, I am... I am not concerned about the character of my team.
given the, uh, character issues, you might want to do a dry test on a case.
like maybe the dead pool boy at the hotel.
let your team run this one on their own.
shore up their protocols.
somebody's really gunning for us, aren't they?
I don't know who.
all I know is that they got to get the kinks out before the brass sweeps in, does their own eval.
we'll be ready.
who borrowed the backup kit last?
I did.
there are no swabs, evidence bags, and the maglight's dead.
forgot to restock it. Sorry.
gonna borrow some of yours.
actually, I need those.
I know the feeling.
could you at least leave me an extra pair of gloves?
Yes. Yours don't fit me anyway.
we paid good money for the penthouse.
I'm sorry.
well, you can't keep us out of our own room.
actually, I can. It's a crime scene.
what?
any of you know, uh...
know this guy, worked at the pool?
that's Armando.
so, you know him?
he oiled me.
I beg your pardon?
tanning oil. The hotel has somebody who applies it at the pool.
he oiled all of us.
relax.
just relax, relax.
is that true?
Yeah.
this must be some kind of mistake.
there isn't. Armando's been murdered.
I was wondering if any of you ladies could tell me how he got a key to your room?
what?
no.
maybe he robbed us.
hmm. Maybe.
will you excuse us for a second, please?
I counted three wedding bands, but there don't seem to be any husbands.
they're calling it "Wives' Weekend." Sun, spa, but no sex.
hmm. We'll see about that.
Yeah, I knew that, Eric, cause, actually, I worked that case, too, so...
good. Got some blood.
looks like this is where our vic bought it.
or had a drink. That could be a Bloody Mary.
well, Phenolphthalein will confirm that.
even if it's blood, once it's dry, there's no way to tell how recent it is.
the blood could be six weeks old.
Yeah, or six hours.
it's blood. Something happened here.
well, confrontations usually start in the bedroom or the bathroom.
I'll take the bathroom.
I'll take one of the bedrooms.
I guess I'll start in here then.
need some help?
I think I've got it.
Thanks.
there's cast-off on the ceiling with no accompanying blood pool on the floor.
so, somebody cleaned the floor, and forgot the ceiling.
people only clean what's in their line of sight, eyes to knees.
let's see what the crime light's gonna show.
will you get the lights?
looks like a pint's worth of blood.
I wonder who cleaned it.
I know how they did it.
all the towels are gone.
how" is the first step to "who.
excuse me.
I'm with Miami-Dade P. D.
no Q-tips, no laundry bags.
that's all right. I just need to look in your cart.
Oh, si, si.
no, no.
dios mio.
esta bien, te creo.
blood and hair-- looks like I got a twofer.
redecorating your bathroom?
I'm trying to confirm one is a murder scene, and I'm betting that's my vic's blood on the end.
my ThermoCycler will let you know.
great.
and you know I'm good for the rest.
pleasure doing business with you.
Hey, have you got anything on the hair?
take a look.
looks like the shaft is split.
Yeah, and it's flat in diameter.
and it's curly at the root.
african hair.
Yup.
I think we have a suspect.
is this about that pool guy?
we found your hair on the towel bar that killed him.
Oh. Well, it probably got there when I hung up a towel.
I don't think so.
the way it was wound, it's unlikely that it got trapped there from casual transfer.
how do you know it's mine?
well, I could take your DNA.
unless there's something you want to tell me.
okay.
I went back to the room to take a shower.
I guess Armando followed me.
you left this in your cabana.
and then what happened?
I'd rather not get into it.
I understand this is incredibly difficult, but a man is dead.
he was so gorgeous.
showing up at my door.
things like that don't happen to me back in Pensacola.
so you broke the wives' weekend rule.
not exactly.
well, ma'am, either you did or you didn't.
okay, so... the pool boy's cabana wouldn't go up.
it's one thing when it happens with my husband, but come on, this guy was 24 years old, and he couldn't perform?
I was embarrassed.
he had to go take his little blue pills.
don't make that face.
it's not me. It's you.
go to hell.
I had to protect myself.
so you're saying that it was self-defense.
it was.
one hit is self-defense.
two more is murder.
this is called cast-off.
it proves that you took two additional, very bloody swings.
I guess I just lost it.
well...
that's what you write.
excuse me.
Hey.
Hey.
you got a pretty satisfied look on your face.
Beth Jacobson is writing her confession as we speak.
her confession?
Yeah. She killed Armando Diaz with a towel rod.
not according to my evidence.
I know the feeling.
could you at least leave me a pair of gloves?
Yes.
yours are too big for me anyway.
dude, are those rolling papers in there?
they're not mine.
someone must've borrowed my kit.
at least they restocked it.
Yeah, we really got to crack down on the pot smoking kit thieves around here.
I said, they're not mine.
relax, Delko.
I believe you.
I hate it when people jump to conclusions, don't you?
no, Officer, sorry.
I don't seem to recall anything like that.
maybe I can get your statements.
sure, we'll give you anything you need.
do you know when we'll be able to go inside?
thank you, Officer.
this must be some kind of mistake.
okay. I'll start in this room.
hang on.
need to clear a path.
path for what? There's no body.
path to the other rooms.
evidence gets stuck to shoes.
just happened in a case a couple weeks ago.
actually, I remember that, Eric, because, um, I worked that case, too.
good.
got some blood here.
looks like this is where our vic bought it.
or had a drink. Could be a spilled Bloody Mary.
it's blood.
all right, I'll take one of the bedrooms.
I guess I'll start in here then.
so somebody cleaned the floor, forgot the ceiling.
people only clean what's in their line of sight, eyes to knees.
excuse me. You mind if I take a few things from your cart?
okay, gracias.
I ran out of supplies.
great. Thank you.
it could be a trail.
maybe this will lead us to the crime scene.
gracias.
Frank, you got a flashlight?
Ah, yeah. Where's yours?
it's a long story.
looks like a, uh, Felicia Hardy was in this room.
you know, the redhead.
Yeah, nothing hinky about Mrs. Hardy yet.
consistent with her statement.
married, sleeping alone. Or not.
so much for their no sex rule.
is that a hotel laundry bag?
Yeah.
you're supposed to collect evidence with that?
procedures manual only requires a single-use container.
I forgot to restock my kit.
all right.
looks like Felicia went for a triple.
found two more condoms.
found the cause of the blunt force trauma.
doesn't make sense.
guy hits his head hard enough to be fatal...
Where's the blood?
Calleigh found blood in the bathroom.
somebody cleaned it up.
okay, we need to talk to Felicia Hardy. Where is she?
she's down in the lobby.
we finished questioning her, she said she had to go.
Yeah, I bet she did.
Hey, hang on a second.
put that down.
can I help you with something?
Yeah.
were these bags in your room?
Yeah. Why?
gonna have to collect them.
and you are?
I'm-I'm her husband.
thought they were supposed to stay home.
she called me to come pick her up.
why do they need to see your bags, Felicia?
the pool boy broke into our suite, so we're going to need to collect elimination samples as well.
for robbery?
no. For murder.
pool boy turned up dead.
what?
it's okay.
I'm sure they just need fingerprints.
Yeah, and DNA from you.
DNA? For what?
it's standard procedure.
and we also need to hang on to your luggage.
...and we'll let you know.
great.
and you know I'm good for the rest.
okay.
pleasure doing business with you.
it's unbelievable.
what?
Wolfe.
again?
you need to just go in a room and beat each other up.
Yeah, I just saw him hand a wad of cash to that reporter girlfriend of his.
for what?
for what? For more air time probably.
the guy gets off being on TV.
I haven't been here that long, but he seems like a good criminalist.
who cares if he likes the media?
the media can ruin a case.
Really?
I heard she helped you guys out on the Mala Noche thing.
elimination samples-- call me when the results are in, okay?
and don't forget to run it against...
the condoms. Yes, I know.
thank you.
you know, you got some trust issues.
you're right.
all right, that's it.
looks like it's going to be just you and me, Armando, baby.
apparently, CSIs have more important things to do.
great.
what?
well, I think I found sodium sulfonate and fluorescent dye on Felicia Hardy's suitcase.
blood's my thing, Eric. You gonna have to translate.
it's, uh, it's laundry detergent.
it's not a huge lead when you find it on a soccer mom's luggage.
where one door closes...
your victim's DNA was inside the condoms, but the really good part?
the vaginal contribution on the outside matches Felicia Hardy.
the brochures say the air's different in Miami.
I didn't know what they meant till I got here. Yeah, right.
the air.
makes you cheat on your husband.
I know. I can't believe I did it.
I... I mean, I just feel sick.
I love Steven.
that's why I called him to come get me.
I just wanted to pretend none of this ever happened.
well, what did happen?
pool boy seduce you?
not exactly. Kinda the other way around.
look, I didn't go looking for him.
he just appeared in your bed.
basically.
look, I came back from my massage, and he was in my hotel suite, holding some ice to his head.
he told me he had slipped by the pool.
what was he doing in your room?
returning a book to Beth. Said the maid let him in.
you notice if his head was bleeding?
that's not what I noticed.
I know when a man is attracted to me and he was very attracted.
my...
I found some blood and hair on the headboard. How'd it get there?
I think he must've hit his head. I...
you don't know?
I couldn't really see him. He was...
he was behind me.
you didn't notice that he hit his head?
we were together for almost two hours.
so I just thought he was, you know, exhausted.
Armando? You okay?
I definitely didn't think he was hurt.
God, I feel so guilty.
guilty about what, cheating on your husband, or leaving a man to die?
I'm sorry.
you got a pretty satisfied look on your face.
Beth Jacobson is writing her confession as we speak.
her confession?
Yeah. She killed her Armando Diaz with a towel rod.
not according to my evidence.
what do you mean?
I collected three condoms from Felicia Hardy's bedroom.
DNA on the inside said it's from our vic, Armando, and the DNA on the outside said it's from Felicia.
and you think that's what killed him-- excessive lovemaking?
excessive. Yeah.
what about the blunt force trauma?
he cracked his head on the headboard.
see I disagree. According to the spatter, Beth hit him three times, one free, two cast-off.
she killed him with a towel rod.
no, it was Felicia. The guy conked out right next to her, she failed to call 911 and then decided to skip town. It's negligent. homicide.
actually... you're both wrong.
I know who the killer is.
welcome to Hotel Graciana.
relax, Delko.
I believe you.
I hate it when people jump to conclusions, don't you?
beg your pardon?
tanning oil-- hotel has someone who applies it.
he oiled all of us.
that true?
well, maybe he robbed us.
maybe.
will you excuse us...
okay, I'll start with this room.
hang on.
got to clear a path first.
a path to what? There's no body.
found some blood.
looks like this is where our vic bought it.
I'll take one of the bedrooms.
I guess I'll start in here then.
sir? You need something?
no, I'm just expanding the crime scene.
all right, well, let me help you.
I'll put up some more tape.
great, thank you.
Oh, he's right.
there's some blood.
could be a trail.
maybe this will lead us to the crime scene.
Really?
Yeah.
it's definitely gravitational, you see that?
blood points in the direction of travel.
it's toward the stairwell.
looks like I found where the guy was killed.
went over the railing here, hit the stairs down there.
looks like our blunt force trauma.
I'll secure the area, sir.
uh, it's just Ryan, okay?
you are, Ryan Wolfe. I...
I thought I recognized you. From the Erica Sikes, TV.
Yeah, great.
could you just make sure nobody comes back here?
is that evidence?
what?
Yeah, that's a contact lens.
so what do you think?
accident? Homicide? Suicide?
based on the height of the rail I would see hand marks if he fell.
from bracing himself?
exactly. And he probably didn't jump, cause he was bleeding from the head, so chances are, he was probably too weak.
leaves one option.
Yeah, murder.
it looks like our killer left a calling card.
Ryan?
just the man I was looking for.
Erica, not now, I'm busy.
I need to ask you something.
if it's a question about the case, I can't give an answer.
okay, it isn't, but point made.
well, come on, what is it?
I need to get reimbursed for that DAT you busted.
you know, from the whole Mala Noche thing.
my producers have been hounding me, and...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, how much is it?
500 bucks.
500 bucks?
for a recorder?
are you kidding? What is it, dipped in gold?
Erica, I work for the county. I can't afford that.
I didn't break it, Ryan.
I'll give you more when I get my paycheck.
you know I'm good for the rest.
pleasure doing business with you.
get in line, Ryan, I'm completely buried.
Where's Markham?
took a personal day... again.
I got a bloody shoeprint from the hotel murder.
shoeprint? This is Firearms.
firearms does patterns and impressions.
Markham never told me that.
Yeah, I'm not surprised.
got a partial here.
Mm. Least I know what I'm doing with a computer.
I'll run it through image recovery.
we should get something.
looks like a... looks like a logo.
no, no, it's lettering, maybe?
all right, I'll run it against the font database.
that spells expensive.
I think I know somebody who can afford them.
I swear, I didn't kill anyone.
I got a call from the penthouse suite, asking me to move a body.
is that just one of your many services?
the woman said it was an accident, and I believed her.
what woman called you?
didn't ask her name.
the hotel caters to VIPs. I've learned to be discreet.
okay. So just walk me through this.
well, I went to the penthouse, the body wasn't there.
I thought it was a prank, but then I saw the blood.
if you were in the penthouse, why was your footprint in the stairwell?
when I left the suite, I heard something.
different place, same corpse the woman told me about.
I had to move the body.
okay, so you dumped the body in the front lawn of your hotel.
come on, Craig, that's not very "discreet."
no, I-I... put him in the trunk of my car, but as I was pulling out, he came to.
help! Someone!
Oh, and that's when you killed him.
No! I let him go.
I actually watched him walk away.
and if that's true, Craig, how did the dead body end up on the front lawn of the hotel?
I have no idea! I know it sounds insane, but it's true.
I mean, how could I make something like that up?
Craig, people lie to the cops all the time.
hang on, I got proof.
he tried to bribe me to let him go.
he gave me this.
it's worth about 50 grand at least.
please.
all right, get out of here.
I didn't accept it as a bribe.
I just took it because I knew it didn't belong to him.
Yvette?
I guess you know who called me.
I think she did more than that.
Dennis and Yvette, 1998.
where did you get it?
apparently, Armando Diaz had it.
the guy who died?
Yeah, the guy you pushed.
I don't know what you're talking about.
he must have stolen it when he was oiling me up.
see, I might believe you except I found this at the crime scene.
what's that?
it really must be hard to walk around with one contact in.
look, it was an accident.
Armando and I... hung out at his cabana earlier that day.
you mean you had sex with him.
correct.
the ring was in my purse, I figured he must have taken it, so I went to find him.
you're crazy! I don't have your ring.
I can see it there in your pocket!
Oh, my God.
if the ring's so important, why didn't you grab it when he was out cold?
well, I wanted to, but I couldn't.
someone was coming.
that was the manager that you called.
I didn't call anybody.
well, you better call your lawyer.
no, it was Felicia.
the guy conked out right next her, she failed to call 911, then decided to skip town.
it's negligent homicide.
actually, you're both wrong.
I know who the killer is.
Diaz was killed on the stairs.
Yvette pushed him over the railing.
which stairs?
utility stairs outside the penthouse suite.
I found a pool of the victim's blood.
the guy bled all over the hotel.
how does that prove anything?
okay, let's not do this in front of the suspects.
I don't understand. Beth confessed.
Felicia told me straight out that Armando hit his head while they were having sex.
okay, I have a weapon covered in Armando's blood with Beth's hair on it.
cause of death, please.
blunt force trauma.
which was Alexx's first impression while she waited for somebody to show up at post.
I thought you guys went.
we thought you did.
we never assume anything, do we?
Oh, that's Alexx's report.
what's the cause of death?
fracture of the cervical spine.
died of a broken neck.
caused by his header down the stairs.
but his jaw was intact, which it wouldn't have been if the fall broke his neck.
so someone broke it for him.
right.
but who?
okay, so we know that Armando was in three separate altercations.
none of which killed him.
well, the guy had stamina.
Yeah, tell me about it.
he was with Felicia Hardy for over two hours.
with pharmaceutical assistance.
Oh, yeah? He took Viagra?
Beth Johnson saw him take it.
which means that he was with Beth Johnson before Felicia.
that's why he could go on for two hours.
and then Yvette.
I don't have your ring.
I can see it right there in your pocket.
and then he ended up in the stairwell for the manager to finish him off?
Yeah, but the manager said he didn't do it.
do we have any evidence to prove that he was lying?
like trace from the victim's body?
well, I... I didn't tape lift him.
I thought you usually did that.
no, you were supposed to...
all right, look.
never assume.
the clothes are right here.
Armando was covered in lint.
didn't you see cotton fibers in his hair at the scene?
and my suspect had traces of laundry detergent on her luggage.
okay, we got lint, cotton fibers, detergent.
we've missed a crime scene.
can't imagine what their electricity bill's like here.
how many pounds of laundry you think they go through in this hotel?
try tons.
and they still can't get the blood out.
this is where our vic was killed.
the strength it would take to subdue Armando, let alone snap his neck...
and a woman doesn't have it, no matter how much she works out.
brings us back to the manager.
or whoever left the print.
there is one more man in the picture.
we are going to sue your entire department for this.
fine, maybe your lawyer can explain your husband's handprint in the victim's blood.
this was left by Armando's killer.
and this is a thumbprint left when your husband picked up your luggage.
it only takes one print to match to a person.
we compared the handprint to the print on your luggage.
my guess is it was just a happy coincidence you ran into Armando Diaz in the parking lot.
Armando had been through a lot already.
probably didn't have much fight in him.
this is ridiculous. I wasn't even here.
steven was in Miramar when I called him.
it's a 45-minute drive.
did you call him on his cell phone?
how do you know exactly where he was?
all right, you know, that's enough.
Felicia, don't say anything else until we talk to Jerry.
Umm-huh. Hold on.
take a last look at this other picture from when you were loading luggage in your car.
notice the windshield.
looks like you got caught in a little rainstorm.
even though it was 70 and sunny in Miramar all day.
we checked.
Miami had a sun shower between 11: 03 and 11: 14.
that's right.
your windshield was in Miami at 11: 00.
which means that you were, too.
you were here.
you were spying on me?
Felicia...
you've shown no interest in me in the last two years and you're spying on me?
that doesn't make sense.
I know, I know.
then what were you doing here?
which one?
I'm sorry, Felicia.
I really am.
Yeah, and Mr. Hardy doesn't like his mistress cheating on him.
you slept with this guy?
what? I don't see you leaving your wife anytime soon.
doesn't mean you can screw around on me.
you were my Maid of Honor.
so you slept with Steven and my Armando.
"my Armando"?
you know, I thought this was a wives weekend.
no sex.
look who's talking. Home wrecker.
I thought we were friends.
we don't even know each other.
we know each other, Felicia.
we just don't like each other.
here's to our first wives' weekend.
the first of many.
ever year for the rest of our lives.
here's to doing this till we are old and gray.
I read the hotel has this guy that oils you up.
morning, Mac.
victim' name's Stacie Avida.
she live here?
no, she worked here.
she was the doorman. Woman.
the, uh, super said everybody seemed to like her.
him more than most.
they dated for about a year and a half.
don't have water towers in Montana.
the water pressure in the city's a little dismal, so every building over 16 floors has one.
every tenant have access to the roof? Yeah.
it's like a, uh, extra rec room.
do you know there have been six suspicious deaths in this building in the past ten years?
people say it's cursed.
I took the graveline tour.
you visit places where unexplained deaths have occurred, or famous people have died.
this was stop number eight.
now it's death number seven.
SID: Despite the amount of blood you found at the scene, C. O.D. wasn't exsanguination.
I found a significant amount of water in her lungs. She drowned.
Whicmeans she was ive when she went inside the tower?
difficult to take a live woman up the side of a water tank, unlesshe's unconscious.
my thought exactly.
an injection mark.
there's an endless number osubstances that could just knock her right out.
I nt blood to Tox.
also found evidence of sexual activity.
the semen sample was diluted from the water, but still a chance you can pull something.
here's the smell of the blood still.
all the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
Macbeth.
radial and ulnar arteries were both severed.
superficial wounds to her knuckles and the tops of her hands.
I pulled more glass fragments from her wounds.
directionality of the incisions suggests movement in both distal and proximal directions
a sawing motion.
significant arterial spray with this type of wound.
crime scene must have been a mess.
no.
there was nothing to suggest her wrist was sliced inside the tank.
no blood trail outside of it.
not a drop.
how is that possible?
I'd say a quick jab, followed by a left hook and a straight right.
never knew you were a boxing fan.
I'm a fan of all sciences, especially the sweet one.
used to watch with my dad.
lividity's not fixed.
he's been here less than six hours.
killer used tremendous force.
probably collapsed the cricoid cartilage.
I'd say C. O.D. is strangulation.
wallet and phone are still here.
let's find out who this guy is.
Ben Hatfield.
23 years old.
got a business card.
works for NHT Media as a field consultant.
must have been casual dress Wednesday.
what's he doing in Washington Heights?
any witnesses?
no.
HAWKES: They're all suffering from the same thing
temporary blindness.
well, let's see what we can see.
fake tooth.
knocked out.
sand in the eyes.
I'd say this started out as a good old-fashioned playground fight.
I got blood.
they were fighting over here.
he was strangled no more than six hours ago, but the color of the bruises on his face and hands...
are eight to 12 hours old.
but this blood is still wet.
means our vic wasn't in one fight.
he was in two.
that's not a handprint, that's a glove pnt.
Hawkes says I missed some fun at the playground. No worries.
we brought some back just for you.
these photos were taken fr our vic's camera phone.
he was quite the photographer.
I like the subject matter.
these girls are fine.
girl, not girls.
look at the eyes in all the photos.
right, right, I see.
these are all the same girl.
different hairstyles, different clothes
she's quite the chameleon.
these all look like candid shots to me.
she didn't even know she was being photographed.
Yeah, maybe our vic,
Ben Hatfield, was a stalker.
Yeah.
and if this guy here was her boyfriend, maybe he wasn't too happy about that.
it looks like all these shots are taken on the same street.
let me see.
let me get that bus stop sign back there.
orge Washington Bridge.
washington Heights.
good job.
what are these?
I was hoping you could tell me. They're all of you.
okay, somebody's following me?
well, not anymore.
the person who took these pictures is dead.
his name is Ben Hatfield.
you know him? No.
and I don't like people I don't know taking pictures of me.
my guess is your boyfriend here doesn't either.
what's his name? I don't know.
just some guy who wanted to buy me a cup of coffee.
no need for names?
it was just coff.
this guy here, he could be a murderer.
so next time you see him, get a name, and then give me a call.
epithelial DNA from the swing's chain came back as... everybody's in the world.
the blood came back as our vic's.
imprint on the vic's shirt was left by tar and New York City di.
and whoever grabbed the shirt was wearing gloves at the time.
what about the blood we found in the sandbox?
belongs to an unknown male.
I'm ill waiting on news from Autopsy. How'd you do?
I've got nothing but what I think are lies from our vic's object of affection.
but I did find the next hot thing.
hmm?
remember NHT Media?
it was on Ben Hatfield's business card.
next Hot Thing.
he was a trend forecaster for Madison Avenue.
he wasn't stalking Jennifer Rodriguez.
he was working.
they call it "cool hunting.
I've read abouthat.
what's hot on the playground is worth millions on Madison Avenue.
that must be why he had all those pictures.
and why he was in Washington Heights.
but why is he dead?
monroe: Mac, this case is getting creepier by the minute.
all of the previous deaths in that building had "mysterious circumstances"?
sounds to me like you're starting to believe in that curse?
mac, I believe in the science.
me, too.
what do you have?
this is what I found in Stacie Avida's apartment.
blood on the door frame.
flowers from the roof and a used condom.
the semen from the condom was a match to what we found in the vic.
what about the blood on the frame of the door?
a male donor, but it's not a match to the semen.
but I found a substance on the flower consistent with mucus.
that is a match to the blood.
but not a match to the semen.
Therwere two male donors in their apartment.
her boyfriend, the super
didn't have a cold; he's allergic to flowers.
murder and romance-- it's always about the little things.
we'd talked about getting married, or at let living together.
we were doing great.
evidence from her apartment suggests you weren't the only man in her life.
that doesn't sound so great.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about you going to Stacie's with flowers from the roof garden.
a romantic gesture.
what's not so romantic is what you found in her trash.
this is a surprise.
you should've called first, Joe.
you seein' someone else, Stacie?
you gotta go, Joe...
is he here? No!
Stacie... Aah!
I'll put up with a lot, but not that.
was Stacie's daughter there at the time?
she doesn't have kids. That's not what the evidence is telling us.
you didn't know Stacie was cheating on you, you didn't know she had a daughter.
sounds like there's a lot you don't know.
Yeah, okay, I was played.
big deal.
it is a big deal.
betrayal's the oldest motive for murder in the book.
...boy meets girl.
boy impresses girl with his pimped-out ride...
right.
all right, we've talked to girl, where's boy?
I may be able to find him.
see the reflection in the window?
can you clear it up, Danny?
give me a sec.
let me enhance the resolution.
BONASERA: Look at you.
boom.
nice, Messer.
let's see where that car takes us.
tox came back.
Stie Avida was injected with ten times the therapeutic dose of prescription-grade morphine.
I'm looking at the shards of glass
cathedral Water Glass, to be exact.
85% of it is found in stained glass windows.
and when we canvassed the building for witnesses, there was stained glass on every floor.
look at this.
panel's darker.
that's the only color consistent with the glass we found on the vic.
looks like these windows are uble-paned.
this one's patched on the inside.
whose place is this?
Craig Zimmer, MD.
he would definitely have access tmorphine.
man: Escalade's my company car.
BONASERA: Who drives it?
elliott Stanton. Works for me.
my best employee.
trend spotting?
Yeah, so, uh, what's this all about, detectives?
it's about your competition-- The Next Hot Thing.
one of their employees was murdered and found in Washington Heights.
what does this have to do with my company?
I mean, Next Hot Thing is no threat to me.
I mean, I know what's hot long before they do.
I don't have to kill the competition.
I'm already doing it.
would this be the next hot thing?
guaranteed.
what makes you such an expert?
I'm just a poor Dominican boy made good.
I grew up five blocks from here.
you know, when people see Washington Heights, they thi urban decay.
see, I see the future.
and now all the big companies are coming to me.
Madison Avenue lov that I still have one foot in the neighborhood.
they know that I'm connected and that I operate at a street level.
what does Jenny Rodriguez get for all this?
the girl in your pictures.
I guess you just steal her fashion design
you don't need to know her name.
man: See, my clients pay me for information.
and before you know it, everybody walking down Times Square looksp to see what I discovered.
the rest of America jumps on board.
I run a multimillion-dollar corporation.
I'm not in public relations.
I suppose if the competition, say,
the Next Hot Thing-- took a few photos of Jenny, things would get complicated, huh?
I don't like what you're implying.
now... I'm a very busy man, detectives.
you know the way out.
I have one more question:
Where's Elliott Stanton?
man, for half the kids in this neighborhood, this is it.
they never leave, never go anywhere else...
not even Jersey.
this is their whole world.
well, they may never leave
but their culture and styles avel everywhere.
what do you know?
elliott Stanton's on Rico's payroll and he gets to drive the company car.
BONASERA: You know this guy, Elliot?
Nope.
imagine him alive.
never seen him. Looks like you were at the wrong end of a couple punches.
you landed a few, though, right?
looks like that hurts.
you two paramedics?
MESSER: All right, look, we get it, Elliott.
your boss told you we'd be swinging by, so stop playing coy boy, do this the easy way and answerur questions.
okay. I fell off my bike.
before or after you slammed your fist into Ben Hatfield's face?
Ben who?
MESSER: Ben "Hanging from a Swing in the Park" Hatfield.
what are you doing?
what do you think-- next new fad:
ligature marks instead of tattoos?
hear you're really good at your job.
we're even better at ours.
you think about that.
you get it? I got it.
good.
probably my kids; they're always breaking things.
my wife runs the apartment I just pay for it.
and where's your wife?
they're in the Hamptons.
look, now is not a good time for me.
I've been in surgery for 11 hours, been on my feet for 36.
doctor, you keep impeding my investigation,
I'd be more than happy to take you someplace where you can put your feet up for quite awhile.
well... looks ke our docr has a taste for painkillers.
soil's consistent with what's on the roof.
found blood on the glass from the window.
drugs, glass, shoes: Looks like it's all adding up.
except why he would kill a woman
look, there's the vic's tooth.
huh... He must've swallowed it in the fight.
second fight, to be exact.
it's still ihis stomach rather than his intestines.
I collected trace from the implant post that remained in his mouth.
And?
and, as soon as you analyze it, it could lead you somewhere.
Hey, I was elbow-deep in his stomach, and I walked it up here. Mm-hmm.
can't do everything.
Thanks, Sid. Mm-hmm.
reptile skin.
elliott Stanton is our prime suspect, and we don't have enough evidence to hold up in court.
hold up-- don't throw in the towel just yet.
exhibit A:
elliott with his arm around Jenny, gloved.
exhibit B: Our vic's shirt with grab marks
a pattern left by gloved hands.
we don't know that it was Elliott's gloves that made the impressions on the shirt.
Bruing and cuts from this picture I took of Elliott's hands, consistent with the wounds we fou on our vic.
, that just proves that Ben Hatfield and Elliott Stanton got in a fight, not necessarily with each other.
you don't need to be a pathologist to see that Elliott's hand's infected.
knocked out Ben's tooth; at's what opened the flesh.
what we see and what we can prove are two different things.
we need to connect Elliott Stanton with our victim, prove that it was his gloves that made the pattern on the shirt, and his fist that knocked our victim's tooth out.
and, ultimately, that it was Elliot Stanton's blood we found in e sandbox.
safe to say we're skipping lunch.
Yeah.
my next.
yo, why don't you and your little Blue Man Group here go find a playground on t Upper East Side, okay?
in fact, we're gonna stay here for a while.
this is a murder scene.
a kid was killed here just this morning.
you know, funny how nobody saw anything.
so these guys are going to stick around, all right?
we'll see what we can see.
as long as it takes.
unless you know something.
give me my ball back, man?
I'll tell you what. Why don't you play me?
you beat me, I'll get out of here,
I'll take these guys with me, not to mention y get to tell everybody you beat a cop.
and if you win?
you give me a little information.
you serve.
yo, check it out.
is the anything we can get you, Doc?
I'm sick.
Oh, yeah, I can see that.
for a guy who works in the medic field, you don't take very good care of yourself.
you recognize the symptoms, Detective Monroe, in the junkies we get through here every day.
that building you live in has quite a reputation.
superstition, it's stupid.
six deaths in the past ten years.
and, uh, your name is mentioned in three of the cases.
one of the murdered women was your nanny, who you were having an affair with
stupid superstition starts looking a lot like pattern, doesn't it?
I came down here voluntarily to, uh, answer a few questions.
I'm wondering what they might be.
she was a doorwoman in your building.
okay, and?
and your phone records say that you called her regularly for the past three months.
no, no, I never spoke to this woman in my life.
semen found inside her body matchethe DNA from your reference sample.
that's impossible.
I certainly wouldn't sleep with her. I didn't.
the smashed stain glass from the window in your apartment is an identical match to the glass we found embedded in her arms.
phone call, the semen, stained glass.
the way I'm seeing this, you did have a relationship with this woman.
she asked you to leave your wife, you said no.
there was a fight.
you pumped her full of the morphine you happened to have lyinaround the apartment, then dumped her in the water tank.
that's not true.
I do not know her. I don't.
I've been at the hospital for a day and a half.
I got 50, 100 people can back me up.
we'll look into that.
you all right to hang tight for a bit?
need anything?
a little chicken soup, maybe?
monroe: I wouldn't want to be in Dr. Zimmer's shoes.
something's off, Mac.
Zimmer's involved in this up to his neck, but his behavior doesn't make any sense.
why didn't he toss the shoes?
and when Flack leaned on him, he didn't call a lawyer?
Sophia Reza died in that building three years ago, raped, no semen found.
they never caught the guy who did it.
what does that have to do with this case?
she was Zimmer's nanny and they were having an affair. And look at this.
four years ago, choking victim on the roof.
Zimmer's there, tries to save her, but n't.
Meaning?
Meang he's everywhere something bad happens.
maybe he's cursed, not the building.
Lindsay, we can only deal with the science in front of us.
forget everything else.
but I was taught that instincts point you in a direction.
science confirms a theory.
Taylor.
okay.
we'll see what we can do.
we need some science that puts Zimmer on the roof.
otherwise, he's free to go.
the substance pulled from Ben Hatfield's mouth was reptile skin.
reptile skin? Yeah.
treated like leather.
means it came off a bag, boot, belt or anything else reptile skin may be used for.
what about you?
I got a match.
it was this type of glove, identical to the gloves
Elliot Stanton was wearing in the photo that made the imprint on his shirt.
and the tar and the dirt of the pattern are a match to the handball court.
okay.
but anybody who's playing handball in that court and wearing that type of glove could have pushed Ben.
it doesn't necessarily single out Elliot, right?
no, but my three victories at handball gives us something that does.
how so?
an eyewitness who saw Elot Stanton going at it with Ben Hatfield.
sounds like we got enough for a warrant.
you should have seen me whipping these kids' asses.
the material on the bottom of Dr. Zimmer's shoes is identical to the earth from the roof garden.
but it could have gotten there any time.
we need something we know connects him to Stacie Avida.
the hair on the picture frame in Zimmer's apartment is consistent with hers.
do you have the lift of this print?
over time, the amount of squalene
one of the oils found in fingerprints
deteriorates at a steady rate.
so we measure what's remaining...
...find out when Zimmer last handled this frame.
print on the picture frame's over 28 days old.
it wasn't used in Stacie's murder.
so how did her hair get on the frame?
who else has access to the doctor's apartment?
Joe Green.
he's the super. He'd have a master key.
maybe he's trying to frame Zimmer fothe murder.
I need you in Dr. Zimmer's shoes because the plaster casts
I got from the suspect's footprints are about a half an inch deeper in the heel than they were in the toe, which is odd.
I weigabout the same as the victim, you weigh out the same as Dr. Zimmer.
Thanks. Extra weight makes it exact.
look, you promised me drinks for this, but I think I'm gonna need some dinner, too.
I'm not going to give you anything if you don't get going.
make tracks, cowboy.
what do you have?
the initial tracks from the roof are an inch shallower than the ones Danny and I just made.
the curve of the track is lighter in the toe and heavier in the heel.
I know, but what does that mean?
you said earlier that you wouldn't want to be in Craig Zimmer's shoes.
he wasn't.
there's no question these shoes made the tracks on the roof.
worn by who?
the victim was wearing aqua-colored socks when we found her.
why would Stacie Avida be wearing ????
Eikenella corrodens.
it's also called "fight bite" because it proves that the cut on your hand came from someone's mouth.
someone's mouth.
as in one person in a city of eight million.
your gloves also match the pattern we found on Ben's shirt.
come on. Lots of gloves in the city like that one, Detective.
you're right, Counselor.
I wasn't clear.
they microscopically match.
you hit him, didn't you?
I didn't kill him. Don't say anything, Elliott, please.
that's all right. I can tell you what happened.
see, Ben was honing in on your turf
on Jenny.
the newest "it" girl.
and you decided to do something about it.
detective, my client agreed to come down here and answer some questions.
ask them, or we're done.
Ben was a little tougher than you thought, huh, Elliott?
after he beat you the first time, you went back there, only this time, you didn't play fair, strangling him with a swing chain.
he was alive when I left him.
enough-- from both of you.
come on, let's go.
Mr. Garlobo, I'm curious.
why won't you let your client talk?
it's obvious he has something to say.
Mr. Cerda retained me to protect his employee and I intend on doing that.
elliott does not know what's best for him.
that right, Elliott?
let me give you a little hint.
the truth is always best.
come on.
the answer is in here somewhere.
I grabbed all the case files from the previous deaths in the building
autopsies, everything.
I also got everything on Stacie Avida
former residencies, work history.
Zimmer's name is mentioned in three of the cases.
everything's connected, right?
through evidence, not intuition.
wait. Hear me out.
Gina Williamson is the girl who choked on the rooftop.
I had Hammerback pull Stacie's DNA for reference.
Gina shares one allele with Stacie at all 13 loci.
Gina was Stacie's daughter.
and she died four years ago on that roof.
Gina?! My daughter's choking! Someone call 911!
somebody help us!
Dr. Zimmer had two previous complaints filed against him for practicing under the influence, but nothing was ever proven.
TAYLOR: He was using drugs on the day he tried to save Gina, overcompensated, fracturing her rib which punctured her heart and that killed her.
Stacie Avida was a natural brunette.
and she worked in publishing until two months after her daughter's death...
when she left to become a doorwoman.
she wanted total access.
the building was haunted
by a woman who died the day her child did.
we're not gointo get anything out of Elliott now that his lawyer's got him gagged.
what we do know is that the gloves and bacteria put him at the beating.
we just need to tie him to the strangulation.
you know, I was thinking, since there was sand in the vic's eyes, the fight in the sandbox happened at the same time as the strgulation.
and since the only thing we found in the sand was blood...
if it's a match to Elliott's referen sample...
it means we're that much closer.
Yep.
no match.
no.
Hey, Hawkes, check this out.
the blood from the sand has a 15. 2 allele at D7.
that's a variant allele.
that falls outside of the range of common alleles.
it's indicative of a subpopulation.
gets passed around through a small genetic pool but never goes worldwide.
which would make it ethnically specific.
let's see if it's specific enough to catch a killer.
found it.
a variant 15. 2
at D7 locus.
common to 90% of the people from one particular island.
actually, half of the island.
Dominican Republic.
you know anyone from there who might like wearing reptile?
the very trendy Rico Cerda.
purple one is supposed to make you smarter.
that true?
or is it all in the packaging?
I know you didn't come all the way up here to discuss energy drinks.
so, what's on your mind, deteives?
couple of things
the Yankees pitching rotation, you murdering Ben Hatfield in the playground.
that's ridiculous.
I didn't have any...
let me tell you something about trends, Rico.
see, this is the part where you get indignant
start to deny everything, maybe you're going to start crying, try to convince us you didn't do it.
MESSER: Crocodile tears.
crocodile like the watch band you have on.
piece of that skin was found on an implant post in Ben Hatfield's mouth.
torn watch band. Doesn't prove anything.
t your blood at the crime scene does.
see, you sent a boy to do a man's job.
when Elliot couldn't close the deal, you went and finished it.
rico: I told you to stay out of my neighborhood.
MESSER: It's not like it used to be, Rico.
you don't like that.
couple of years ago, people were afraid to come up to Harlem.
now they're walking the streets, they're shopping, they're taking their kids to dinner.
your neighborhood, Washington Heights, is primeeal estate.
it's attracting a yuppie crowd.
the outside world is closing in on you.
the urban divide is disappearing, man, making guys like you obsolete.
this is my neighborhood.
my street.
my people!
I warned that kid.
I told him he didn't belong here
him and his big corporation raking in millions off the ingenuity and style of those poor kids?
he got what he deserved.
he was trying to take what belonged to me.
what belonged to you?
you and your $3, 000 suit.
BONASERA: You talk a really good game, Rico.
but the truth is, you sold out your neighborhood.
and your people.
she... planted the evidence?
everything we needed to build a case against Craig Zimmer.
best way inside the building was through you.
FLACK: And when the doorman job opened up, she asked her boyfriend, the super, to get it for her.
she wanted to do everything she could to keep her eye on you and your family.
once she had it, she had total access to your life using his master key.
she used your phone, she knew about your affairs, and over time, she learned your habits, your secrets.
she studied you.
TAYLOR: She knew when the doctor's wife would be out of town, when he would at the hospital.
yesterday, she put her plan into effect.
it must have taken weeks to set up her plan-- months, even.
she was patient.
she knew Zimmer was a drug addict and found the morphine.
she knew if the drugs were in her system, it would lead back to him, the only doctor in the building.
she did everything she could to set him up.
she couldn't live with the pain of mourning her daughter anymore.
she killed herself.
and she made it look like murder.
to frame you.
thank you for clearing me.
don't thank me too much.
I put in a call to the medical board about your obvious drug addiction.
time to clean up.
joe: It's ironic she killed herself where she did.
the newspapers say that building is cursed.
well, this time it wasn't the building's curse.
it was Stacie's.
you know what?
it doesn't matter that she used me.
I loved her.
guess that makes me a chump, right?
no.
watch your backs.
coming through.
move it, move it.
...1010, possible hijack of a medical helicopter, last seen departing hope morial hospital helipad.
delta two responding.
we got a guy down in here, dan.
Flack, he's alive.
let's get an ambulance out here.
looks like it's just this guy, though, and nothing eE.
it's not what i wanted to hear.
search the area, set up a perimeter, and call canine.
we're trying to locate the guy with the key to this scissor lift.
they hung the billboard yesterday.
left the equipment here overnight.
looks like he slammed into the billboard and bounced off the light fixture before he finally landed.
hole in the fabric of his scrubs.
Arearound it is saturated with blood.
guess the guy either works at a hospital or medical center, huh?
gunshot victim.
lividity.
head and arms is pinkish purple.
I'd say this guy's been here a couple of hours.
that'd put him here about 4: 00 o'clock in the morning.
so far tre's nothing to indicate that he was thrown out of one of the windows or off the top of the building.
he wasn'T.
air traffic control reported a hijacked medical aircraft, intern and pilot on board.
I think our vic was thrown from a helicopter.
Hey, mac, we found, the, uh, helicopter.
pilot's alive, but he's unconscious.
I heard a rumor that you found our intern, Ryan Elliot.
Yeah. He's on his way to autopsy now.
did you happen to find anything else?
well, you want to give me a hint exactly you're looking for, flack?
an igloo cooler with a human liver inside.
so, this wasn't about hijacking a helicopter.
it was about stealing a donor organ.
first business at hand.
prints.
that should help confirm the I. D.On the vic.
hmm.
he was shot only once.
it was a through and through.
very clean, very straight wound.
the bullet moved through the flesh quite easily.
it appears he was trying to turn away.
that slight movement resulted in the tearing of the right ventricle, leading to significant internal bleeding.
our cause of death.
exactly.
size of the permanent wound cavity suggests that the bullet didn't mushroom, so it was some kind of jacketed round.
find that bullet, and it might lead you to your shooter.
Mr. Cooper?
uh, new trench coat.
got it dirtylready.
hmm.
sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm Detective Bonasera.
this is Detective Monroe.
can we get you anything?
coffee, water?
no, I'm good, thank you.
Mr. Cooper, we'd like you to tell us everything you know about lillian stanwick.
and more importantly, all the details of your last conversation with her.
I tried to explain this to the officers that called me.
I don't know a lillian stanwick.
Really?
I checked my client list...
several times.
well, you are an architect.
I'm sure you meet lots of people.
it's hard to keep track.
it's hard to remember.
I never met her.
this is a photo from her driver's license.
I don't know this woman.
it's awfully noisy in here.
let's take this conversation someplace quiet.
detectives, I'm very sorry this woman is dead, but I can't help you.
it'll only take a minute.
keep moving!
Ah, man...!
right through here. Come on. -I didn't do nothing.
this is your business card, right?
looks like it.
we found it in lillian stanwick's purse.
dusted it for prints.
what you see here is actually the negative impression of the pattern of the friction ridge on your finger and hers.
see, the prints on the edge of the card belong to our victim.
we confirmed that by printing her corpse.
you handed this card to lillian stanwick.
you held it between your middle and index finger, like a clothes pin, and she grabbed it with her index finger and thumb.
you're assuming those prints are mine.
obviously, someone else gave her my business card.
maybe, but can you explain to us why the last phone call she made before she was murdered was to you?
what?
we ran her phone records.
you spoke to lillian stanwick for seven minutes last night.
doesn't sound like she dialed the wrong number.
three days ago, you spoke to her for 15.
the week before that, minutes on tuesday, and 22 minutes on friday.
still don't know who she is, Charles?
this is how I first saw her, and I can't forget her.
she's only 22 years old.
see how the spoke from the wheel pierced her neck, Charles?
I'm not answering any more of your questions.
I'm leaving.
wait a second.
a few minutes ago, you didn't know who she was, and suddenly you're in a hurry?
didn't you like our pictures, Charles?
I was told the helicopter was on the roof.
Mr. Rice had been wheeled into pre-op, and ten minutes later,
I was told we weren't getting the liver.
it had been hijacked.
it was shocking.
doctor, do you know this young man?
no, I don'T.
he signed for the liver at the donor hospital.
Ryan Elliot.
he must be an organ courier.
he works at the other hospital, where the organ was taken from the donor.
it's rare that I meet them.
I'm usually in surgery.
it's proper procedure for a courier to deliver the cooler?
well, it varies. More often than not,
I pick up the donor liver myself.
in other cases,
I've had the pilot of the helicopter walk it right into E. R.
last night, you didn't pick it up? Why not?
my first concern was mr. Rice's ability to undergo major surgery.
I needed to be here.
thank you.
other than your staff, the transplant staff at the donor hospital and air traffic control, who else would know that helicopter was carrying a liver?
well, ifou're considering suspects, detective, the list is endless.
if the donor was a victim of something like a c accident, anyone at that scene could assume or possibly know that his organs would be harvested.
our patients and their families wait for a very long time to be selected for a transplant.
their only hope is that someone will step up and volunteer or someone young and healthy who's agreed to donate their organs dies.
they're desperate.
desperate enough to kill for an organ that could be incompatible?
I wish I could point you in the right direction, detective, I really do...
because that liver is only viable for another 12 hours, and my patient may not live that long pilot radioed atc from here when he landed and again when he took off.
his destination was the 34th street helipad which is just across the river from where we found the helicopter.
so the flight path didn't appear off course on atc radar.
When'd they know the helicopter was hijacked?
15 minutes after it took off from here.
the pilot was able to enter into a different frequency, which alerted air traffic control that the aircraft had been hijacked.
get a chance to talk to the pilot?
Yeah, I did. He's still a bit rattled.
not too helpful with a description.
he said there were two guys.
one guy held a gun to his head.
looks like blood to me here, boss.
the pattern looks like it's consistent with the vic's gunshot wounds.
so he was shot here.
stop! Don't move!
put the case down now, now!
he turned for some reason.
bullet sliced through his flesh.
fell there.
Yeah. We gotlood.
Where's the bullet?
our bad guys pick it up?
couldn't have known the shot was a through-and-through.
the bullet bounced there...
and fell over the edge.
I see something shiny right there, mac, but I can't tell if it's a bullet, though.
let's find out.
how we going to get it out here?
the midtown fisherman.
A-ha! Gotcha.
that's quite t contraption.
Yeah, it's my own invention.
you got to use real bubble gum.
none of that sugarless stuff.
in the wintertime, I use peanut butter.
gum gets too cold, freezes up.
Hey, I was wondering...
ha! Hold on a sec. I'm working here.
it's got to be a dime.
you can't really tell till you get it up and out into the daylight.
you-you know, I actually pulled a diamond ring out of here two days ago.
Mr. Fisherman, we're in a hurry.
do me a favor: Let us borrow your gadget.
no. Get your own.
please?
you see that?
a little politeness goes a long way.
just... ju, um, take your time, relax.
that's it. That's it.
visualize.
become one with the gum.
okay, that's it.
on the average, how much you make a day, fisherman?
uh, on a good day,$30, maybe $40.
get out of here.
Hey, it's not like I don't work for it.
got it.
Hey, mac.
are we sure the name on the helicopter manifest was ryan elliot?
Yeah. Signature was also on the paperwork.
signed out at havenview hospital, picked up the cooler and boarded a helicopter headed for hope memorial.
well, I ran our vic's prints to confirm I. D.
Evy medical employee in the state of new york is printed and in a database.
the body we found dangling from that scissor lift was a pediatrics intern named Sean Hovac.
then where is Ryan Elliot?
why didn't you check in, ryan?
I never do.
if the hospital needs me, they call me.
I get two days off every nine days.
that time is mine.
you always go out of town?
no, I don'T.
you know they're selling organs in china on the internet?
I hear you can make quite a bit of money.
what's the going rate for a liver these days, Ryan?
I had nothing to do with what happened.
my friend was murdered.
a whole bunch of people on the donor recipients' list are running out of time.
if someone was really desperate, they'd pay just about anything for an organ, wouldn't they?
this is crazy.
it's totally crazy.
maybe you knew what the plan was all along and at the last minute got cold feet, huh?
tell us what you know, ryan.
if sean was really your friend, you'd want us to get these guys.
there's a man dying right now, and he needs that liver.
you've got one death on your hands.
don't make it two.
I am not involved.
look, I'm going to tell you my story one more time.
my roommate called.
he had knicks tickets on the floor.
I was done with my shift at the hospital and on my way out when the request for the organ courier came in.
there's nothing to it.
it's just a helicopter ride, sean.
I already signed all the paperwork.
just make this delivery.
nobody's going to ask any questions, and they certainly won't know you're not me.
what if I get caught?
doing what, saving a life?
they don't care who delivers this liver as long as it gets there.
you're cool, right?
Thanks, man. I owe you one.
if I hadn't gone to that game...
it would've been my bodyou found out there and not sean's.
simple as that.
captivating, isn't she?
something about her makes me feel so vulnerable.
she had a blood alcohol level just above legal.
I sent a sexual assault kit to DNA.
there was evidence of intercourse.
she was raped?
well, no defensive wounds or vaginal tears.
no signs of a struggle that just means she didn't fight back.
doesn't mean she consented.
there is a possibility she was unconscious.
cause of death was arterial subdural hemorrhage.
very rare.
all arachnoidal artery in the brain is sheared.
the result of a grazing blow to the head.
the bleeng is more rapid and therefore more lethal than the usual subdural hemorrhage.
she definitely passed out.
I dusted the bike wheel for prints.
there s no sign that she had been struck by it.
I ess it's a viable possibility that she fell on top of it.
this isn't adding up.
no struggle, no defensive wounds.
there were no sis at the scene that she had been dragged there or forced.
what was lillian stanwick doing in that tunnel?
look, this is the second time I've had to call.
he was supposed to finish painting today, but he didn't show up.
look, you know, I have tenants moving in next week.
No! Are you stening to me?!
I need the painting completed now!
no, last time I checked, it wasn't my job to hunt down your employees.
can't you do your job?!
for crying out loud!
very nice.
Ryan elliot swears he's not involved.
and you believe him?
Yeah, I do.
money's a powerful motive, hawkes.
I know, I know, but my gut tells me he's a victim in all this.
you don't spend all that time going to medical school, then mess it all up.
I had nothing to do with what happened.
my friend was murdered.
did danny get anything from the prints he found inside the helicopter?
no, not a thing.
what about sean hovac's clothing?
pe lifted. No foreign trace.
the guys that did this aren't rookies.
they had to know what they were doing, have access to not only the hospital but the roof.
and somebody on the inside had to let them know there waan organ about to be delivered.
well, they murdered sean hovac...
...but not jeb clayton, the pilot.
maybe the duct tape and head injury were all a ruse and he was in on it.
they needed someone to fly the helicopter, right?
Sean may have been an unexpected casualty.
killing someone wasn't part of the plan.
tracked down the match you got from the bullet.
came from a gun that was used to rob a dry cleaners on the upper east side about a week ago.
you have a suspect?
in custody-- angie watson.
but we never recovered the gun.
wasn't on her when she was arrested fleeing the scene.
sounds like we need to have a little talk with miss watson, see if she remembers where she lost it.
you have very beautiful eyes, you know that?
thank you.
now, why don't you tell me about the night you got collared.
you got a girlfriend?
who'd you give the gun to, angie?
I've been here before.
some cop or D. A. Gets me to tell them what they need to know, makes a lot of promises on how they're gonna get me out.
a week later, I'm stilhere in the same kind of ouble
I was in before I said anything.
we'll wo something out.
would these eyes lie?
I had just left the dry cleaners.
I took off down 64th and maybe halfway down the block,
I tossed the gun in the garbage can.
lot of garbage cans on 64th street.
row of brownstones, gold-plated doorbells, lots of flowers on planters around trees, two red bikes chained together, silver garbage can with a lid.
you had to be moving pretty fast.
and you managed to remember all those details.
or maybe you needed to remember exactly where you tossed it, so you could call your friends and tell them where to pick it up.
who has the gun?
are you kidding me?
I didn't waste my one phone call on those knuckleheads.
they're the reason why I'm here now.
if I was you,
I'd check with the guys at sanitation.
but that's just me.
was the can full or empty?
I remember the sound of the gun hitting the bottom.
no dna results yet.
vaginal samples from lillian stanwick's rape kit suggests two profiles other than her own.
so she had intercourse twice that night
possibly once with charles cooper and then somebody else.
she know all these people?
all these men.
not one of these cards belongs to a woman.
so maybe she's some kind of a high-end call girl.
I don't think so.
she didn't live her life like that, and I found a pay stub at her apartment.
she was working as a hostess at that trendy restaurant called majorca.
well, you can pick up a lot of business cards at a job like that.
Mm-hmm.
but then, why wouldn't charles cooper admit that he gave her the card at the restaurant.
what's the crime in that?
he didn't remember it.
Stella, lillian stanwick is hard to forget.
true.
so let's focus on our second guy.
I've narrowed our playing field a bit.
according to her phone records, she spoke to these eight men several times in the past six months.
eliminates all these.
see, what I don't understand is,
I checked her incoming calls, and none of these guys have ever placed a call to lillian, including charles cooper.
so she was stalking them?
I thought about that.
but why would you stay on the phone for 20 or 30 minutes with someone who's stalking you?
right.
so now we have nine suspects, including charles cooper.
no, actually, we have three.
see, these two were out of town at the time of the murder.
these three have alibis.
and this one, this guy died of natural causes.
he was 87 years old.
leaves us with charles cooper, architect, will graham, veterinarian, and dwayne gessner, attorney.
so all we have to do is put one of these three in that alley.
I know lillian stanwick, but I've never met her.
I'm not sure exactly how to explain it.
sounds complicated.
why don't you take a deep breath and give it a try.
three months ago, I got a telephone call.
it was a woman.
and she said... -your cat's in my garden.
I don't have a cat;
I told her that.
but she continued to suggest that I did.
why didn't you just hang up?
I don't know.
I don't remember exactly why the conversation continued past that point, but I think we talked ten minutes that first time.
then she called two days later, and she said it.
your cat's in my garden.
couldn't hang up the phone.
we talked 15, 20 minutes.
come on, will, all that time on the phone, more than one call.
she didn't tell you her name?
no.
I find that hard to believe, dwayne.
look, I asked several times.
all she ever said was... -what would you like my name to be?
after the first few calls,
I figured it was some unspoken rule.
I was afraid that...
if I pressed it, she'd stop calling.
every time I picked up the phone and said "hello,
I'd pray the voice on the other side would say...
your cat iin my garden.
what would you two talk about?
me.
I told her things I've never told anyone.
so you'd stay on the phone for 20 minutes at a time for, what, therapy?
okay, yeah, it got sexual.
it was phone sex.
and she was good at it.
she knewust what to say.
must have been really hot.
you must have wanted to meet her.
no.
I'm a married man.
I wouldn't cheat on my wife.
in fact, my sex life with my wife was pretty much nonexistent until she started calling.
did you tell anybody?
I was embarrassed.
I was obsessed with some mystery woman on the phone.
if more than three days went by,
I would panic, thinking she was never gonna call again.
do you know how she got your number, dwayne?
no.
she said... -you gave it to me.
don't you remember?
but I didn'T.
I'm pretty good at remembering things like that.
did you ever eat at majorca's?
all the time.
Why?
she work there?
the hostess.
I didn't notice her.
always just phone calls?
just phone calls.
and you were never in that tunnel?
can I look at your coat, charles?
there it is.
I've seen this before.
you were brushing off this section of your coat when I met you.
just as I thought.
huh.
see, leaves are like fingerprints.
no two are alike.
you were in that tunnel, charles cooper.
care to change your story?
okay. All right.
I got fed up with just the phone calls, I wanted more.
Mm-hmm.
I told her to meet me somewhere, anywhere.
ninth street spillway tunnel--how romantic.
she picked it.
close your eyes.
if you open them, I'll leave.
you didn't even look at her?
I stole glimpses.
I didn't want her to go.
I didn't want it to stop.
finally, it did, and I took off.
and I swear to you, she was alive when I left.
you know what?
maybe in all this passion, you just got carried away.
slammed her head against the concrete and left her there unconscious to die.
does that sound about right?
no. No, it doesn'T.
Charles, I think it's time for you to get an attorney. turn it in.
Adam?
okay, okay. Sorry.
I'll leave you alone.
uh!
very attractive.
the DNA sample from the sex kit of our vic, lillian stanwick,"it's a complex mixture of multiple donors.
well, I suggest that you just kick back and relax.
it's going to take adam quite a while to isolate the priles.
have you ever gotten an anonymous phone call from a woman?
sure. It's happened.
does it turn you on?
Whoa!
slow down there, montana.
What'd you have in mind?
our vic was having relationships with over 20 men.
all on the phone.
sounds like an addiction.
these guys were really hooked.
and she was just a voice.
they knew nothing about her, not even what she looked like.
s a fantasy.
uncomplicated means of sexual arousal.
you get a little somethin'-somethin'
you don't ha to pay for dinner.
how can anybody be satisfied with just that?
I find it hard to believe that one of these guys is not our killer-slash-rapist.
phone sex doesn't fit the profile of a rapist.
because rape is about control, not sex?
right. And your vic was the one initiating the phone calls, right?
okay, so she was in control, not these guys.
so it's a possibility that lillian stanwick was raped by a total stranger.
possible.
that's what I'm talking about.
all right, we got a hit.
that's from a xenon headlight.
it's covered with the same series of numbers.
tiny discs are sprayed onto the lens of the headlamps in the form of a liquid adhesive.
Datadot technology.
every disc is laser etched with an I. D. Number.
certain car dealerships started adding datadots to headlights because they were being stolen so often.
this isn't just any number.
it's the vehicle identification number of a mercedes benz.
our getaway car was a mercedes e-55 registered to dr. Jennifer goss, 525 64th street.
upper east side.
I'm catching this one.
row of brownstones.
two red bikes chained together.
silver garbage can with a lid.
gold-plated doorbells.
lots of flowers and planters around trees.
it's okay.
it'll be okay, I promise.
I love you.
this is our address.
get out of the way!
look out!
don't move.
don't even think about it.
you've got to let me go.
the men I hired.
they're holding the liver hostage.
they've asked for a ransom or they'll destroy it.
please. Please.
please help me.
my wife will die.
Dr. Beaumont, you have the right to remain silent.
use it.
whoa.
how you doing?
Stella?
what? What happened?
Adam finished the DNA profile.
one is a match to charles cooper.
so he's our guy?
no.
once he separated the profiles and analyzed the peak heights, he determined that charles cooper's semen was more degraded than the other sample.
which means charles wathe first to have intercourse with her, not the last.
we can't put our other two guys in the tunnel.
so, we still hav a second, unknown male.
we're back to where we started.
no.
there was a match in the database to the second profile.
D. J. Pratt.
I can't believe it.
son of a bitch is back.
we did everything right 18 months ago, and this guy was acquitted because she wouldn't testify.
and now regina moore is asking for a miracle based on paint thinner and gut instinct.
did he do it?
without a doubt.
D. J. Prattas painting this apartment.
he attacked lillian stanwick, and that's why he didn't show up for work.
I should have put it all together.
Stella, you couldn't have known.
no, it's pratt's M. O.
he pais apartments.
that's when he chooses his prey, and then he stalks them.
he watched lillian stanwick come and go.
and then he followed her.
and he watched her and charles cooper in that tunnel.
he waited for cooper to leave...
who's there?
...and then he raped her.
Oh, please god...
get off of me.
let go of me.
at the hospital, when you said there was a life you needed to save, you weren't talking about ed rice.
I'm a transplant surgeon, detective.
there should be no reason that I can't save my own wife.
you know what stands in the way?
a list.
my wife has to wait until her name is at the top of the list.
and you don't like that rule.
no, I don'T.
I've saved so many other lives,
I shouldn't have to wait.
you've got to find that liver, and you, uh, you got to get it to jennifer.
that was your plan.
you knew a liver that was compatible with mr. Rice's would be a match to your wife, so you hired those thugs to hijack the helicopter.
I thought of a thousand ways to do it diffently, detective.
but sometimes you get a sign.
you know, it's A...
an opportunity presents itself.
I know a lot of people, detective.
a lot of people owe me favors.
if I provide the gunand the vehicle and the cash, it would be taken care of.
Dr. Steiner to icu.
Dr. Steiner to icu.
this kid lost his life.
no one was supposed to get hurt.
but he did, and things got complicated, so they held the liver for more money.
and suddenly, whose life are you saving now?
what about ed rice?
top of the recipients' list
liver was a perfect match, and he's been waiting for over a year and a half.
he didn't deserve that organ.
he's an alcoholic.
he chose to destroy his body, disrespect something that is so precious.
and you decide who lives and who dies?
I just wanted to save jennifer.
I wanted my wife to live.
now you've left her to die alone.
you know you had something, dr. Beaumont, something that some of us who've suddenly lost a loved one never had time.
time to make the most of what was left.
that's what's precious.
Hey.
how'd it go?
DNA came through with a positive I. D. On a suspect.
well, that's good, right?
it's D. J. Pratt, aiden's rape suspect.
we lock him up?
no.
the only thing we could prove is that he had sexual intercourse with our vic.
that's not good enough, stella.
I promised aiden we'd get him.
just do me a favor, huh?
catch this guy for regina.
I will.
this folder...
will be right here on my desk till we get him.
I'm not breaking that promise.
we're taking D. J. Pratt down for murder.
I cannot believe they lost.
I can't believe you gave me six points.
so what you got for me today?
just, uh, these drums here.
all righty, sweet cheeks.
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, man, I'm going to be cleaning up this mess up for days.
what the hell is that?
navy NCIS Naval Criminal Investigation Service
no, the best thing is for you to do nothing, okay, agent Mcgee? Just secure the area and wait for us to get there.
okay.
case agent at Norfolk sounds pretty green.
you look like hell.
a woman loves to hear that, Tony.
if you're coming down with something, don't sit next to me in the truck.
there's an upside to having a cold.
you want to tell the doctor about it?
you guys ready to go?
uh, all set.
uh, yeah... and Ducky and Jackson are already on their way.
Oh... god.
Oh, god. I'm sorry.
I...
what do you put in your coffee?
Coffee.---Okay,
I'll just go down the hall, and get you another cup.
that's not coffee.
meet you in the truck.
I've never experienced Gibbs without his morning coffee.
we're in uncharted waters here, Kate.
Yeah, there are multiple purposes for hydrofluoric acid on a naval base.
its most commonly used to surface clean metal.
it's highly corrosive, readily penetrates human skin, destroying soft tissue and decalcifying bone.
from the look of this fellow, I'd say he wasn't in that drum very long.
I'd venture less than 24 hours.
worst case of acid indigestion I've ever seen.
Hey.
better get Michael Jackson out of here before he ralphs.
come on, Mcgee, help me take measurements for the sketches.
he wearing cracker jacks, doc? - Yeah, definitely enlisted.
we're not going to get fingerprints, but on the left forearm, a bit of skin attached and some discoloration.
a birthmark?--Possibly.
I'll be able to tell more when I get him home.
the armed forces DNA registry can get us a match.
they're backlogged. I wouldn't count on anything for at least 48 hours.
I've heard stories about special agent Gibbs.
only half of 'em are true.
the trick is figuring out which half.
with inspection procedures as tight as they are, probably murdered on base.
they didn't get him past us in the trunk of a car.
which means he had to be murdered by someone with clearance.
Yes, sir.
anyone reported missing?
we had a UA seaman last week, but he was picked up at his home.
whale huggers?
Yes, sir. They've been bugging us for weeks.
why don't you just shoot 'em?
I've been tempted.
save the whales!
we have to keep the crime scene under guard until it's released by Gibbs.
I'll let security know.
Gibbs wants NCIS to remain in control.
so...
I should stay here?
Mm-hmm.
we'll get you relieved as soon as we can.
okay.
why are you making him stay here?
because I can. That is a complete abuse of authority.
lighten up. He's new. He expects to be abused.
it goes with the territory. This isn't pledge week at sigma chi, Tony.
bet you were a lot of fun in college.
I was a lot of fun in college.
Really?
fortunately, your facial bone structure is intact.
with these photos, Abby will be able to build a computer model.
not a model you'd want on your mantelpiece, but she'll do the best she can.
Abby's getting Gibbs on the line.
Ah. Uh, would you?
sure.
good morning, guys.
Where's Ducky?
right here, Jethro.
got a name?
we're good, but we're not that good.
well, what do you got that's good, doc?
uh, death was from blunt force injury.
there's a fracture to the rear of the skull.
that's it? No.
remember that discoloration on the forearm we thought might be a birthmark?
well, it wasn't.
I digitally enhanced it. Watch.
looks like a rorschach test.
it's part of a tattoo that was blurred by the acid.
what is that?
that is the tail of a dolphin.
our victim was a submariner.
that would be a good guess.
you know, the history of tattooing is fascinating.
Egyptian... - how many subs in port?
uh, I'm...I'm copied on the daily movement report.
a woman of thebes, yes, whose tomb indicates that she was...
interesting filing system, Mcgee.
three Los angeles-class attack subs in port at the moment, another in dry dock.
there were five, but the philadelphia left at 0600.
get me copies of the ships' alpha rosters.
I'm on it.
now, this nonrepresentational geometric style of tattooing...
what if the body was put into acid, not only to dispose of it, but to...
but to make certain that it couldn't be identified?
maybe the murderer didn't want us to know the submariner was dead.
maybe. / Agent Gibbs!
the alpha rosters.
everyone on the sub crews is accounted for.
including the Philadelphia? - Yes, sir.
a submariner is dead, but none are missing.
and the dead man's identity was removed.
someone to his place on one of those subs.
an impostor?
let's pay a visit to the submarine squadron commander.
uh, you want to avoid captain Veitch.
what?
well, I met him once before.
he can be very... difficult.
and you don't think that I can be difficult?
um, I'm sure you can, sir.
you're telling me somebody killed one of my sub crew members to take his place?
I think there's a very real possibility.
not on my watch, agent Gibbs.
can you take that chance, captain?
it would have to be someone new.
humor me.
all right.
I'll beef up security around the boats in port.
have every new crew member's I. D. card checked against their service record.
what about the Philadelphia?
she's a day out.
I think you should call her back.
agent Gibbs, the philadelphia is en route to join a Nato exercise in the atlantic, and your theory is highly speculative, if not preposterous.
I'm not about to bring her back.
then send special agent Todd and me to rendezvous with her and interview the new crew members.
well, the presence of a woman aboard a submarine is a tremendous inconvenience.
you know that.
I do.
don't you have another agent that you can take with you?
I do.
Kate, step out.
glad you understand.
I don't.
excuse me?-- Don't tell me how to run an investigation.
Yeah, I've got other agents who could do the job, but none as well as special agent Todd.
formerly, she was attached to the president's secret service detail, trained as a profiler.
I don't care what she was trained for. She's a woman. And females cannot be deployed on a submarine.
chief Patterson, report to machine room.
chief Patterson, report to machine room.
what is this, Victorian England?
the men with their cigars and brandy, while the ladies sip tea in another room?
I'm more qualified for this investigation than Tony.
to replace me because I shave my legs and not my face is unconscionable and certainly not in the best interest of the case.
you claustrophobic?
No.---Good.
I'm going?
don't forget to wax.
I think I'm more excited to dive on a nuclear sub than I was flying air force one.
see if you're still as excited by the time we get there.
special agent Gibbs, special agent Todd, welcome to the enterprise.
sorry your stay's so short.
your helo's standing by.
how do we get from the frigate to the submarine, swim?
close.
I don't see a submarine.
you see it now?
the deck is clear. Hatch secured.
submerge the boat.
make depth two-five-zero feet.
submerge the boat. Make our depth two-five-zero feet.
chief of the watch on the one-m-C.
dive, dive.
dive, dive, dive.
two-five-zero feet and passing.
welcome aboard the Philadelphia.
I'm commander Peters.
this is my X. O. Lieutenant commander Akron.--Sir.
special agent Gibbs. Special agent Todd.
can I help you with that, ma'am?
no, I'm good.
why don't we go to the wardroom?
X. O. Take the con. - Aye, aye, skipper.
cob, I have the con.
I've quarantined the five men as requested. They said you'd fill me in.
fill me in, special agent Gibbs.
one of those men may not be who he says he is.
I find that hard to believe.
a body was found at Norfolk.
it was made unidentifiable, possibly on purpose.
we have good reason to believe that he was a submariner.
15 of your crew are new.
four have been eliminated by dental x-rays.
six can be ruled out because of ethnic origin or body type.
that's it?
your conclusions are based on supposition.
strong suppositions.
I interviewed every one of those men when they boarded and examined their personnel files before they ever set foot on this boat.
we would like that same opportunity, skipper.
you'll get your interviews, agent Gibbs, but you need to understand this boat's about to commence an ASW exercise.
anti-submarine warfare.
an enemy sub tries to infiltrate the carrier battle group.
we're tasked with intercepting and destroying it, theoretically, anyway.
one of our subs plays the enemy?
the Augusta.
her skipper and I have a bottle of stoli riding on who wins.
so you can see why I want those five men back at their duty stations asap.
well, we have a better reason for keeping one of those men out of their duty stations, skipper.
I'd like the cob, for security purposes, to keep the men from talking to each other.
that's affirmative.
chief of the boat.
thank you.
welcome.
Ah, it's coming along.
Yeah, looks like he's going to be kind of a hunk.
he's got a good, strong chin.
I agree. Sort of Cary grant-ish.
I was thinking more Hugh grant-ish.
any luck with the stomach contents?
well, there's good news and bad news.
I hate it when you play this game, Abby.
all right, let's get it over with.
his last meal was a big mac and fries.
well, probably half the base had that for lunch.
I was hoping you'd come up with something a little more exotic.
Tandoori, perhaps.
and the good news?
I know what's in the special sauce.
enter.
petty officer Drew?
Yes, sir.
have a seat.
Yes, sir.
would you give us your right thumbprint, please?
that would be your other right thumb, petty officer.
Oh.
sorry, sir.
I'm a little nervous.
says here you're here from Boston.
south boston, actually, sir.
there's a difference?
well, if you're from boston there is.
you just, uh...
joined this ship from the...
the Topeka, sir.
ssn 754. Out of san diego.
did you request sonar?
Yes, ma'am.
I talked to the recruiter about it.
I've always been into electronics.
I built my own guitar amp when I was a kid.
you enlisted when you were 19, petty officer Thompson?
right out of high school, sir.
19
that's old to graduate high school.
I got mono. Was home my junior year.
they put me back.
may I ask what this is about?
no.
I need your thumbprint, please.
What'd they ask you? - Stupid stuff.
about my high school... - Thompson.
you heard the man.
there is no discussing your interview.
aye, aye, cob.
petty officer Thompson was lying about graduating high school at 19.
he paused and looked to his left.
usually means the response is fabricated.
if he would've looked to his right, he be recalling a memory.--A memory.
you've had profile training.
what I've had is about a thousand interviews.
after a while you start picking up on things.
why would Thompson lie about his age?
I don't know. Why did seaman Riggs lie about being married?
why did petty officer Drew lie about a year in college?
well, maybe Riggs is secretly married and Drew never finished a full year.
everybody has something to lie about...
which means we have nothing.
sonar, still no sign of Augusta?
no joys, sir.
let's come about for another pass.
aye, aye, sir.
I understand you've completed your interviews.
for now. - I need them at their duty stations.
I'm concerned about the safety of your boat, skipper.
your concern will be noted.
X. O. Have the cob return the men to duty.
aye, aye, skipper.
how could someone harm this boat from the inside?
we're vulnerable to any number of things.
chlorine introduced to the re-circulated air could be fatal to the crew.
salt water in the battery compartment could cause an explosion.
the missiles and torpedoes are obvious dangers.
I could go on, but what's the point?
the point is one of those men may be an intruder.
I don't believe that to be the case. I trust every man on this crew.
I'll make arrangements to get you back to the carrier.
we'll leave, skipper...
when we're done, not before.
you were right, Abby. He's quite the handsome fellow.
Yeah, unfortunately he doesn't look like any of the guys that Gibbs suspects.
could our leader's golden gut be wrong this time?
I'm going to e-mail this dude to Tony, and see if anyone in Norfolk recognizes him.
do you see it yet?
Yeah, it's coming through.
so you getting lonely down there by yourself, hon?
Oh, I'm not alone.
I'm with special agent Mcgee.
say hello.
Hey, Mcgee. How's your sig hangin'?
uh...
got to go, Abbs.
what's she look like?
who? --Abby.
sounds cute.
not your type.
well, how do you know that?
have you ever had the slightest urge to tattoo your buttocks, Mcgee?
I don't think so.
then we need never speak of her again.
make copies. Circulate them around the base.
see if anyone recognizes the guy.
I've acquired a target, sir.
distance? --6, 100 yards.
bearing?
depth? / 450 feet.
helm, steer zero-nine-five. 15 degrees down bubble.
aye, sir. Helm zero-nine-five. 15 degrees down bubble.
the fingerprints we took match those in their service records.
if there's an impostor, it's not one of the five that we interviewed.
it has to be.
what if he's on another boat?
this is the one that makes sense.
the killer didn't just dump the body.
he removed identifying features in case it was found.
if it were found, he knew it would take between 24 and 48 hours - for AFDIL to make a DNA match. - Whatever he was planning to do, it was going to be in that time frame.
in that time frame, the Philadelphia was the only boat going out.
Where'd you get the records?
personnel office at Norfolk.
what if someone altered the service record before we or commander Peters got it?
meaning that the impostor worked in the personnel office.
or has an accomplice.
sonar signature looks like the Augusta.
6, 100 yards.
target bearing? - Still zero-three-five relative.
we're in his baffle, skipper. - Range?
6, 000 yards and closing, skipper. - I got you, Jimmy.
I need to contact NCIS headquarters now.
range to target. 5, 800 and closing.
no can do, agent Gibbs. I'm about to win a bottle of stoli.
Weps, get me a firing solution.
your bottle of vodka's going to have to wait, skipper.
I need to talk to headquarters now.
we'd have to break contact and go to periscope depth.
whatever it takes.
I'm not terminating this exercise so you can have a chat with the folks back home.
let me give this to you straight, skipper.
there's a threat on this boat.
it's a real threat.
it's not a game.
X. O. --Sir?
make your depth 1-5-0 feet.
sonar, see if you can hang on to him.
take us up to periscope depth.
aye, aye, sir.
make our depth one-five-zero feet.
slow to all ahead two-thirds. Stand by to go to periscope depth.
I'll give you two minutes, special agent Gibbs.
they're patching through to your man.
two minutes.
cob, why'd we stop the attack on the Augusta?
cops had to make a phoneall.
it's got something to do with them interrogating us, doesn't it?
no. Why would you think that, petty officer?
Hey, boss.
did you find the guy?
Nope. Could be any one of our five.
what's your famous gut say?
for you to find out who had access to the philadelphia's service records.
think they were altered? - Good guess.
wasn't a guess. - Then why'd you ask?
I didn't ask. It was a definitive statement.
I have good news and bad news, Abby.
I hate payback. - Which first?
bad.
no DNA matches on our victim. The AFDIL computers are still down.
okay. Good.
I know why Hugh Grant didn't match any of the photos.
okay, you got your payback. Tell me why.
Gibbs thinks one of the service records was altered.
so all this was a waste of time?
au contraire.
all we have to do is get photos of those five crew members from an independent source.
that'll take longer than a DNA match.
I have photographs of every cricket team I ever played on from second form all the way through up to the upper sixth.
you see, in our last year, we made the division finals.
grant you, I was only on the reserve.
I just know that there's a point here somewhere.
all ships have a crew photograph.
Yes.
Yes!
Yes!
I'll download crew photos from websites of the five suspects' previous deployments.
you should have seen me in my whites.
I was rather handsome even if I do say so myself.
when a sailor reports to Norfolk, we download their service file, update it if necessary, and make a hard copy for the sailor's command.
you update their photos?
only on re-enlistments and significant promotions.
most updates are performance evaluations, awards, marital status.
so your department can change anything in a service record?
Yes.--Fingerprints?
we could, but why would we? - Who handles submarine command?
everyone. We don't assign work basedon specific commands.
and how many people work here, lieutenant?
four officers, 12 enlisted and 47 civilians.
that's a lot of people.
they don't think so. We've been swamped since Iraq with all the transfers in and out of here.
so you wouldn't know who handled crew replacement for a specific ship?
no, but I could ask. They might remember.
they might remember, but I don't think they'd tell us.
why not?
I promise to tell you someday.
can I have a copy of your personnel roster?
as long as you keep your promise.
Jonesy, I need a copy of our personnel roster.
right away, lieutenant. - Uh, cute? - Yeah?
may I ask the lieutenant a question?
McGee, you don't need my permission to ask a question, as long as you're not asking her on a date.
no, sir. Not my type.
lieutenant, special agent Mcgee has a question.
uh, I was just wondering if anyone had quit in the last few days.
as matter of fact, Joshua fox quit two days ago.
how long did he work here?
a little over a year.
he transferred into personnel a month ago.
could you get us his address?
Thanks.
it's on the roster.
thank you.
you're learning, Mcgee.
thank you, sir.
anything?
no, sir.
I can't find him.
damn NCIS.
drink.
what's with all the water?
Oh, you got to hydrate on a submarine.
all you've had me doing is hydrating.
drink it.
so how's your bladder?
what?
the cob's at the end of the passageway, trying to keep an eye on us.
you got to distract him.
you're going to need help working the toilet. ---Gibbs...
trust me, Kate.
on a submarine, it's a very complicated mechanism.
is that why you've been shoving water down my throat for the past hour?
I want to check out petty officer Thompson.
you don't have to drown me. You could just ask.
come on.
Hydrating's good for you. Go on, un-hydrate.
never heard it called that before.
go on!
commander Peters said I could use the facilities in his quarters, cob.
Yes, ma'am. This way.
well, either no one's home or not answering.
what should we do?
get inside, look around.
we'll need a command search authorization.
this is civilian property, sir.
we'll have to go to a local judge to get a search warrant.
or play football.
huh?
go deep.
go deep!
Oh, look at him! He breaks free!
go, man, go!
he's looking for Mcgee!
it's a play-action pass. He's deep in the pocket.
he can't find Mcgee. He's covered!
he's in the open! He's broken clear.
he's still got it.
this is breaking and entering!--No.
that was breaking.
this is entering.
we going to need a torque wrench.
I'll get it.
you trouble me, Thompson.
how's that, sir?
I don't think you were completely honest with us.
Yes, I was.
I think you lied about high school.
why would you do that?
the truth, sir?
Oh, yeah. That's always the best.
I missed a year of high school 'cause I was in juvenile detention.
my record was expunged, but I was afraid if the navy found out,
I'd never see the inside of a sub.
agent Gibbs.
you were asked to stay in the wardroom.
you can go back to work, petty officer.
aye, aye, cob.
busted.
I didn't appreciate that little stunt. - Cut us a little slack.
no harm, no foul. - No, sir.
the skipper's cooperated with you every step of the way.
chief of the boat knows the crew better than the skipper.
you bothered by any of the men we questioned?
we've only been out one day, agent Gibbs.
I make it a practice not making snap judgments.
it could be something little, seemingly inconsequential.
you get a strange vibration about any of them?
no.
but if I do get any vibrations, they'll come to you through the skipper.
do people react that way because we're NCIS, or do you just have that effect on them?
I like to think it's me.
I downloaded crew photos from the ships our suspects served on, and I got nada.
no one looks like him in any of them.
I don't know what to do now.
absent a miracle, we'll just have to wait for the DNA report.
I don't think this guy's ever cooked in his kitchen.
no plates, no utensils, nothing. - It's all store-bought junk.
there's not one personal item here, not even a phone.
well, maybe he used his cell phone.
what's that?
it's a DSL line.
it's running from this jack to under the bookcase.
all right.
slide this towards you on three. One, two, three.
guess flying toasters would have been too much to ask for.
let's see what we have here.
you've taken computer classes.
master's in computer forensics, MIT.
I see.
he's definitely an eco-terrorist.
he's looking for retribution for the whales.
Oh, this isn't good.-- What?
isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate.
B. S. in biomedical engineering, Johns hopkins.
you?
ohio state, phys-ed.
I was a jock.
what is that in my language?
sarin gas.
he's planning on introducing it into a submarine's air conditioning system.
doesn't say how.
it wouldn't take a lot, would it?
must have been a prototype.
if it was filled with sarin gas, and distributed through the air system?
it could kill the entire crew.
skipper, we have an incoming emergency action message on the low frequency receiver, sir.
impostor on board. No id.
threat of sarin gas to air conditioning system.
take immediate action.
have engineering shut down the air conditioning system and tear it apart.
and get those agents up here now. - Aye, aye, sir.
surface! Surface! Surface! Emergency blow!
surface! Surface! Surface! Emergency blow!
emergency blow! Surface!
what's happening?
emergency blow.
skipper wants you.
but hang on a moment.
Yeah, that's what they all tell me.
I remembered that I was absent the day the science club took our picture.
and that made me think, what if one of the five missed his crew picture?
petty officer Drew.
he was absent the day the Topeka took their photo.
Where'd you get this picture?
I downloaded it off the sub's on-line newsletter.
drew is a sonar operator on the philadelphia.
no, he's not. He's in my cold storage.
someone else is sitting at his sonar station.
sir, request permission to make a head call.
emergency blow loosen you up, petty officer Drew?
all right,
Martin, relieve Drew.
open all hatches. Break out emergency breathing gear.
aye, aye, sir. Open all hatches. Break out emergency breathing gear.
aye, aye, sir. Open all hatches. Break out emergency breathing gear.
any idea who the hell he is? - We're working on it.
skipper, we've got another EAM coming in, sir.
where is petty officer Drew?
he had to visit the head, sir.
Hey, we matched the prints you faxed.
former petty officer second sean travis.
sonar operator?
that's right.
spent a couple of tours on attack subs before he was dishonorably discharged.
was he hooked up with the protesters outside the gates?
the FBI's checking that, but they think he and Joshua fox were part of some small three- or four-man cell of radical eco-whale freaks.
did you get fox and the rest of them?
not yet.
what's going on down there?
we're on the surface.
I guess Gibbs hung up.
good guess.
secure from emergency breathing.
engineer's gone through the air conditioning system.
looks like he never got his canister into it.
it's somewhere on this boat.
we'll search, but if it's as small as you say it is, it could be hidden just about anywhere.
if the canister remains sealed, it shouldn't be a problem.
we'll tear the boat apart if we have to when we get to Norfolk.
X. O. Prepare to dive. - Aye, aye, sir.
we're going back down?
we're 15 knots faster submerged than on the surface.
I'd leave the air conditioning system off-line as a precaution.
I fully intend to. It's going to get hot in here.
Aah... we're used to taking heat.
hi ya, Abby.
while the boss is away, huh?
I earned my paycheck today.
that's what I heard.
exhibit A.
any idea how it works?
so what's agent Mcgee like?
uh, like most newbies.
quiet, green, gullible.
bi.
I don't think so.--No,
Tony, the canister. It has a bi-metal trigger.
Yeah, so it's turned on by either...
either what? - Hot or cold.
this one digs cold.
when the temperature drops below five degrees centigrade, the trigger releases whatever's in the canister.
what is in the canister? - Sarin gas.
nasty.
so what's cold enough to trigger it on a sub?
fridge, freezer, air-conditioner.
is agent Mcgee cute?
can a guy be cute to you without body art?
sure.
I'm not a snob.
how can you drink coffee when it's 100 degrees?
helps me think.
what's bugging you?
Travis not releasing the sarin.
he never had a chance.
he was quarantined or on duty until the air conditioning system was shut down.
what was his back-up plan?
he would have had one.
what makes you so sure?
this whack job knew he was going to die as soon as he released the gas.
why commit suicide before he could do it?
he knew we were on to him.
I mean, like you said, he was a whacko.
Yeah, enter.
courtesy of the skipper, sir, ma'am.
there's rocky road, cookies and cream, chocolate butter pecan, and the captain's personal favorite, pumpkin.
pumpkin?
do you think we have enough, steward?
there're about 40 gallons more in the galley, ma'am.
might as well eat it before it melts.
I don't get it.
they had to make room in the freezer for the body.
Nice.--It's the only place to preserve it, ma'am.
s. O.P. On a sub.
what?
anyone who served on a sub knows that.
Travis didn't commit suicide to give up.
suicide was his back-up plan! Where's the freezer, cob?
loading door right here, sir.
right there.
the bastard booby-trapped himself.
once he knew he couldn't get it into the cooling system he went to his back-up plan before we could arrest him.
the sarin gas canister was designed to be triggered by cold.
Travis knew that if he died, you'd put him in the freezer.
you mean he swallowed the canister? / Yeah.
if his core temperature gets to the trigger temperature, the gas will be released.
it already has!
when it leaks out, people are going to die.
I'll get the skipper to do another emergency blow.
there's no time for that. Kate, go fill in the skipper.
come on, there's one way to get this guy off this boat in a hurry.
go! Move it! Gangway!
move!
make a hole! Make a hole!
move it! Move! Move!
help us. - Thompson, we need a tube.
we've got torpedoes in two, three and four, sir.
load this in one. Evans is in there doing maintenance.
get him out of there. Get him out, guys, come on.
torpedo room. Con.
con. Torpedo room. Cob.

aye, aye, sir.
secure the inner door! - Aye, aye.

open outer door! - Outer door open.
flood the tube! - Tube flooding!
fire number one.
cob, I don't have to tell you what the most important thing is now, do I?
getting the ice cream back in the freezer.
exactly.
welcome back.
Hey.
nice cap. They make you the boat mascot?
this is your way of telling me how much you missed me, isn't it?
no.
what are you doing here, special agent Mcgee?
I've brought my final report, sir.
you don't have to sir me, Mcgee.
didn't they teach you how to use e-mail at MIT?
you graduated from MIT?
and Johns hopkins.
I didn't tell him.
what are you doing here?
I've got a lunch date with Abby.
I got to see this. I'll take you to her.
Thanks.
thanks what?
sir.
I already warned you Abby's not your type.
I'd like to find out for myself.
Yeah, listen, kid, uh
I don't want to hurt your feelings, but...
you're not exactly Abby's type.
I've taken care of that.
remember that urge you were talking about?
I went with mom.
I wonder what he said to make Tony speechless.
he told him he got a tat on his ass.
you know, Monica's gonna freak if every box isn't labeled.
you're right. Yeah. Okay.
box of crap.
wow, it's wild. When Monica and Chandler come back they are gonna have a baby. A baby!
I know. Oh, wait, Ross doesn't know the baby's coming. Should we call him?
I don't know. Rachel's over there yelling at him. Poor guy.
I would not wanna be him right now.
wait. Wait. Should we be doing this? - I don't know.
it's probably not a really good idea. - Probably not.
well, that never stopped us before. - No, sir!

I can't believe we're gonna be parents.
I can't believe it's three weeks early. I love that our baby is prompt.
okay. All right, what room did the nurse say Erica was in?
702. - Okay.
come on, baby. - Come on, Michelle.
come on. You can do this, baby. - Get this damn thing out of me!
well, these are for you.
did you see the size of the thing that was coming out of that woman?
I couldn't tell who was giving birth to who.
Hi. - Hey. How's it going?
it's okay. The doctor says it will still be a while.
how do you feel? - Well, it hurts sometimes.
not too bad yet, though.
it's a little scary. - I know. But honey, you're gonna be fine.
tell that to the lady in 702 with the toddler coming out of her.
I think that kid was wearing a shirt.
you're gonna be fine, though.
Hey.
go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Oh, God. This was amazing.
it really was.
you've learned some new moves.
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me Sex for Dummies as a joke.
who's laughing now? - I am.
breathe. Breathe.
okay. Good.
next time, can I say "breathe"?
no. Last time, you said it like Dracula, and it scared her.
do you want some more ice chips?
no, I'm okay. - All right. I'll be right back.
where you going? - To use the bathroom.
you can't leave me alone with her. - What?
this is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with.
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
you'll be fine. You won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
okay.
so any plans for the summer?
I don't know. Maybe church camp.
may not want to mention this.
so you ever wonder which is worse?
you know, going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
what? - Oh, it's just interesting.
because no one will ever know because no one can experience both.
who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things.
like this.
come in. - Morning.
Hey. - What's that?
Oh, it's my housewarming present for Monica and Chandler.
that's a baby chick and duck.
and I named them Chick Jr. And Duck Jr.
I did not see that coming.
they'll love it at that new house. It has that big backyard.
when they're old, they'll go to that farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
Yes. - Yeah.
it's a shame people can't visit there. - That is the rule though.
guess what. You're almost an uncle. - What?
Erica went into labor. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now.
Oh, my God! - I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
have you seen him throw a ball?
is Rachel here? - I think she's still asleep.
how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
we worked things out.
what's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.
but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it.
Oh, my God. You and Rachel?
I know, it's pretty great. - So, what does that mean?
are you guys getting back together? - Oh, I don't know.
we didn't really get to talk. - But do you want to get back together?
I don't know.
it was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right.
when I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go.
know what? Yeah, I do. I want to be together.
so is she still going to Paris?
wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.
this is, like, the best day ever. Ever. You guys might get back together.
Monica and Chandler get their baby. There are chicks and ducks in the world again.
I feel like I'm in a musical.
morning. - Guess you'll never know how it ends.
Hey. - Hi.
Hi. How did you sleep? - Good. You?
good. - I'll bet you did.
would you guys mind giving us a minute?
sure. Just keep an eye on the chick and duck.
chick and the duck? Didn't they die...?
dive. Yeah, they dove. Headfirst into fun on the farm.
so...
morning. - You too.
last night was just wonderful. - Oh, it really was.
I woke up today with the biggest smile.
I know, me too. It was...
you know, it was one of those things you think is never going to happen.
and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
I know. It was just...
it's just the perfect way to say goodbye.
just a little bit more, honey. - Oh, man, this hurts!
is it really that bad?
I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse.
the baby's head is crowning.
Oh, my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen.
Chandler, you have to see this. - I'm okay.
you don't want to miss this. This is the birth of your child.
it's the miracle of life. - All right.
wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
start pushing. Here we go.
here come the shoulders.
it's a boy.
is he okay? - He's just fine.
you did it.
it's a baby.
a beautiful little baby. And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
would you like to cut the umbilical cord? - Okay.
well, that's spongy.
Hey, handsome.
I'll love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you.
we are so lucky. - I know.
he has your eyes.
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
we'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.
thank you so much. - I'm really happy for you guys.
how do you feel? - I'm tired.
you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
I'm sorry, who should be along in a what, now?
the next baby should be along in a minute.
we only ordered one.
you know it's twins, right? - Oh, yeah.
these are the faces of two people in the know.
I can't believe you didn't know its twins. This has never happened before.
well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
did you know it was twins?
it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic.
did anybody tell you? - I don't think so.
they did mention two heartbeats, but I thought it was just mine and the baby's.
they said, "Both heartbeats are strong."
and I thought, "Well, that's good, because I'm having a baby."
this is unbelievable. - Twins actually run in my family.
interesting.
can I see you for a second?
what do we do? - What do you mean, "What do we do?"
twins!
twins!
Chandler, you're panicking. - Join me, won't you?
what do you say we keep one and then just have an option on the other one?
we can't split them up. - Why not?
we could give each of them half a medallion.
and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
what if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Yeah. Because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies.
that doesn't matter. We have waited so long for this.
I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies.
I don't care if the entire cast of Eight Is Enough comes out of there.
we are taking them home because they are our children.
okay.
okay. - Okay!
okay.
it looks like we're about ready over here. Come on, Erica.
start pushing again now.
here she comes. - She? It's a girl?
Yeah.
well, now we have one of each.
and that's enough.
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Oh, my God. What did you say?
nothing. What do you say to that? - You've got to tell her how you feel.
no way. - Well, you can't just give up.
is that what a dinosaur would do?
what? - I'm just trying to speak your language.
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you even wanna get back together.
if she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
you really think so? - I'm telling you!
Oh, this is the part of the musical where there would be a good, convincing song.
Hi. - Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Hey. - Hi. I dropped Emma off at my mom's.
okay. - You're not taking her tonight?
we decided I'd set up, then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
eight-hour flight with a baby. Good luck, Mom.
you kidding? Eight hours with my mom talking about Atkins. Good luck, Emma.
all right. You know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
Ross. Wait, wait. - What? What?
could you get me a muffin?
Rachel? - Yeah?
I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you.
I love you.
now, I don't know if that changes your plans at all.
but I thought you should know.
Gunther.
I love you too. Probably not in the same way.
but I do. And when I'm in a cafe having coffee or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun.
I'll think of you.
Bye, you guys. - Bye.
Oh, my God!
unbelievable.
Hey, you know what might help? - I'm not getting you a muffin!
do you think they recognize each other from in there?
maybe. Unless they're like people who've lived in apartments next to each other for years, then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.
we're going to take Erica to Recovery now.
there's something that we wanted to tell you.
we decided to name the girl baby Erica.
Oh, my God, that's just like my name!
son of a gun, it is.
anyway, I'm gonna go get some rest.
I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents.
even Chandler.
okay, well, bye. - Bye.
we'll call you. - Okay.
have fun at church camp.
look at these little bunnies. - I know.
you ready to trade?
okay. - Okay.
okay. Let's see.
we could trade later. - Yeah, I'm good.
Hey, what are you working on? - A "welcome home" sign for the baby.
how sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
no, I sat in the paint.
Hey. - So did you talk to Rachel?
no. And I'm not going to. - What?
why not? - She's just gonna shoot me down.
you saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
how can you compare yourself to Gunther?
I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way.
you have a relationship with her. You slept together last night.
Yeah, and she still wants to go. It's pretty clear where she is.
I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
Joe. - Damn it!
if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now.
okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
no, you don't. She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody.
do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's a city of Gunthers.
Hey. - Hey.
what do you have there? - Oh, I made a little something.
if I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but...
Oh, my God, you did that yourself? - Honey, that's gorgeous.
you know, the baby can't read, Mike.
Hi. The car service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet!
I have to catch my stupid plane. I want to see the baby.
Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute.
apparently, there's some big surprise. - Yeah, did she sound happy about it?
because my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny-tiny beard.
welcome home. - Oh, my God.
Oh, my gosh. - Hey.
Hey.
Hey, so, what is the big surprise?
Oh, my God! - How did this...?
okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
Yes. It's twins. - Oh, my... They are so cute.
now, what kinds are they? - This is a boy. And that's a girl.
her name is Erica.
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Yeah, and we named the boy Jack, after Dad.
he's gonna be so happy. - Jack Bing. I love that.
it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy. You know, "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette."
I'm gonna blow this story wide open.
Oh, my gosh.
so beautiful. - I want one.
Oh, yeah? Well, tell me which one. I'll try to slip it in my coat.
seriously. I mean, you want to make one of those?
one? How about a whole bunch? - Really?
Yeah. We can teach them to sing, and we could be like The von Trapp Family.
only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kind of dull.
I can't believe this. If I don't leave now, I'm gonna miss my plane.
I'm so glad you got to see the babies. - Me too.
I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this.
all right. Oh, I can't say goodbye to you guys again.
I love you all so much. - Love you.
we love you. - Call us when you get there.
I will. Ross, come here.
I just want you to know...
...last night...
...I'll never forget it.
neither will I.
all right. Now I really have to go.
okay.
they're gonna really hate me over there.
so you just let her go?
Yeah.
Hey, maybe that's for the best. - Yeah?
Yeah. You know, you just... Look, you gotta...
you gotta think about last night the way she does.
okay? You know, maybe...
maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye.
they slept together? - I was with you.
now she'll never know how he feels. - Maybe that's okay, you know?
maybe it is better this way.
I mean, now... Now you can move on.
I mean, you've been trying to for so long.
maybe now that you're on different continents...
right?
maybe now you can actually do it, you know.
you can finally get over her.
Yeah, that's true.
except...
I don't want to get over her. - What?
I don't. I want to be with her. - Really?
Yeah. I'm going to go after her. - Yeah, you are!
wait! Wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
my coat. - This is so cool!
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
what do you think she's gonna say? - I don't know.
even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend my life wondering...
...what would have happened. Where is my coat?
you didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs. I'll drive you to the airport.
wish me luck. - Hurry!
good luck!
Oh, my God. Ross is going after Rachel, and you guys have babies.
this is, like, the best day ever.
why is there an ass-shaped paint stain on my couch?
she asked you a question, Mike.
you think we're gonna make it in time?
Hey, I didn't have my license taken away because I drive carefully.
there's no seat belts! - That's okay. If we hit anything the engine will explode, so it's better if you're thrown from the car.
all right, all right. Let's do this. - Okay!
Hey! - 80th and East End.
no. I don't take passengers. - The law makes you accept any fare.
you don't understand. This cab isn't real.
what's your medallion number?
my medallion number is, get out of the cab!
what? - Get out of the cab!
Hey, you guys, check this out.
No! - Okay.
Oh, hey, can I give you guys my housewarming gift now?
now, that you can do. - All right.
I have a question. Without looking into their diapers, can you tell them apart?
of course I can. I'm their mother. - Oh, yeah? Okay. Which one is that one?
that's Jack.
Jack's gonna have a tough time in high school with that vagina.
chick Jr? Duck Jr?
don't hide from Mama!
you can open your eyes now.
are we off the bridge? - Yes!
is the woman on the bicycle still alive? - Yeah, she jumped right back up.
Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down! - Do you want to get to Rachel in time?
Yes, but I don't want to die in your cab.
you should have thought of that before you got in!
tollbooth. - What?
tollbooth!
four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
Hurry!
okay.
damn, that window's clean.
God! Hey!
we were wondering what was taking so long,
...but now we understand. You were doing this.
okay. I wanted to surprise you, but...
for your housewarming gift, I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Oh, great. Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces!
but they must have jumped off the table. Now they're gone!
don't worry, we'll find them.
actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Oh, God! What did I just step on?
it's okay. It's just an egg roll.
you stepped on my egg roll?!
I'm sorry. I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
just put it on a plate and leave.
okay. Let's find these birds. - All right.
wait, wait. You hear that?
they're in the table! - Well, that can't be good.
we gotta get them out of there! - How?
maybe we can lure them out. You know any bird calls?
Oh, tons. I'm quite the woodsman.
well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Joey, wait! The ball!
so, what do we do?
maybe we can open this up somehow.
okay.
no. It's all glued together.
does that mean we have to bust it open?
I don't know. Maybe. - Oh, my God.
I know. It's... It's the football table.
all right, you know what? We don't have a choice.
it's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd have gotten the part.
"those are our men in there, and we have to get them out...
...even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life...
...my time machine."
did that movie ever get made? - It did not.
Ross, where are you going? - To talk to Rachel.
isn't that why we took a ride in the death cab?
you're walking up to her at the gate?
have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
not since my cop show got canceled.
you have to get a ticket to get past security.
what? We're never gonna make it. - Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!
okay, if you could all walk slower, that would be great.
Madame, your passport please. - Oh, my God.
I was afraid I wouldn't remember my high school French.
but I understood every word you just said.
your boarding pass, please. - Oh, sure.
shoot, I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Madame, if you don't have your... - I have it, I have it!
okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C...
...because that's my bra size.
you must have your boarding pass...
you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Hi. I need a ticket. - Just one?
I drive you here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
fine. Two tickets. I need two tickets. - We're on our honeymoon.
and the destination? - I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.
I'm so lucky I married you.
Oh, shoot. Damn it. Where is it?
I found it. I found it. I told you I would find it.
in your face. You're a different person.
sorry.
okay. Flight 421, Paris.
I don't see it. Do you see it? - No. Did we miss it?
no, no, it's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
maybe we have the flight number wrong.
God.
hello. - Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
what?
Hey. Hey, listen...
you wouldn't believe the cute noises the twins are making. Wait, listen.
but Monica...
Monica. Monica. Monica.
I'm sorry. They were doing it before.
that's all right. Listen, listen. - Oh, wait, wait. Here they go again.
Monica. Monica. Monica.
Monica? - Isn't that cute?
that is precious! Listen...
I need Rachel's flight information. - Oh, okay.
all right, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8: 40. - I have that. It's not on the board.
that's what it says here. Flight 421. Leaves at 8: 40. Newark Airport.
what? - Newark Airport.
Why? Where are you? - JFK.
don't worry, you guys! We're gonna get you out of there!
and we're also gonna buy you tiny bird hearing aids.
okay. Here goes.
what's the matter?
I need to say goodbye to the table first.
I understand.
okay.
table...
...you have given us so many great times.
and you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel...
all of you guys. What can I say?
you guys make us look good.
you want to say anything? - I don't know.
except that, for one last time...
good game. Good game. Good game.
good game.
okay. Here we go.
I can't do it.
well, I can't do it either.
Hey. Did you find them? - Yeah. They're stuck inside the table.
and we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it.
Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.
I'll do it. Give me.
Phoebe!
no, no, no!
wow, I've never gone this fast before.
Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is, like, an hour away.
there's no way we'll make it in time.
she's got her cell. You could call her. - I am not doing this over the phone.
you don't have any other choice.
Hello? - Rachel. Oh, good.
by the way, did you just get on the plane?
Yeah. - We would have caught her...
...if we were at the right airport.
Rachel, hang on. - No. No. No.
Phoebe, is everything okay?
actually, no. No. You have to get off the plane.
what? Why? - I have this feeling that...
...something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left phalange.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
what was that? - Oh, that was just my crazy friend.
she told me to get off the plane because she had a "feeling" that there was something wrong with the left phalange.
okay. That doesn't sound good. - Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
she comes up with this stuff, and she's almost never right.
but she is sometimes. - Well...
well, I can't take this plane now.
excuse me, sir. Where are you going? - I have to get off this plane.
her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left phalange.
could I get some peanuts?
what's wrong with the plane? - There's nothing wrong.
the left phalange. - There's no "phalange."
Oh, my God. This plane doesn't even have a phalange.
I'm not flying on it. - Please sit down.
what's going on? - We're getting off. There is no phalange!
this is ridiculous. I...
Yeah, okay.
all right. My job here is done.
that was impressive.
Yeah. You didn't even use the tools for most of it.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down.
all right. I gotta get back to the babies. See you girls later.
sorry about the table, man. - Yeah.
you gonna buy a new one?
probably not. No.
I don't know how much I'm gonna want to play after you go.
at least we got these little guys out. - Yeah.
we were worried about you.
I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
I'm gonna miss these little guys.
it was nice having birds around again.
Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
what? - Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.
and plus, here, they'd have their own room.
I could get a goose!
you know, I think you're set with the poultry.
Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?
you're gonna get to stay here. And it's good...
...you know, because...
because now you have a reason to come visit.
I think there may be another reason.
so...
awkward hug or lame cool-guy handshake?
Yeah, well, you know, lame cool-guy handshake.
Yes. The phalange's fixed.
in fact, we've put a whole lot of extra phalanges on board, just in case.
where is she? - I don't see her.
Rachel! Rachel Green! - There she is!
Rachel! Rachel!
whoa, do you have a boarding pass? - No. I just have to talk to someone.
I'm sorry. You need a boarding pass.
no, no. But you don't... - Rachel!
what? Oh, my God. What are you guys doing here?
okay. You're on.
what? What, Ross? Okay, you're scaring me. What's going on?
okay. Thing is... - Yeah.
don't go. - What?
please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please don't go.
Oh, my God. - I know. I know.
I shouldn't have waited till now to say it, but... That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry.
but I'm telling you now. I love you.
do not get on this plane. - Miss, are you boarding the plane?
Hey, hey.
I know you love me. I know you do.
miss. - I...
I... I have to get on the plane.
no, you don't. - Yes, I do.
no, you don't. - I do. They're waiting for me, Ross.
I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Rachel.
I'm so sorry.
I really thought she'd stay.
I know.
I'm sorry.
well, that's it.
everything's packed.
Yeah.
does this mean there's nothing to eat?
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
I love you.
Hey. - Hey. Did you guys make it in time?
Yeah, yeah. He talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
Where's Ross?
he went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
Ross. Hi, it's me.
I just got back on the plane, and I just feel awful.
that is so not how I wanted things to end with us.
it's just that I was expecting to see you.
and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things.
now I'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have said and I didn't.
I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too.
because of course I do. I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
what am I doing? I love you.
I've got to see you. I've got to get off this plane.
Oh, my God.
okay, excuse me. - Miss, please sit down.
no, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane.
I need to tell someone that I love them. - I can't let you off.
let her off the plane!
you have to take your seat.
Oh, please, miss. You don't understand.
try to understand!
come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off the...?
No! No!
Oh, my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
I got off the plane.
you got off the plane.
I do love you.
I love you too, and I am never letting you go again.
okay. Because this is where I want to be. No more messing around.
I don't want to mess this up again. - Me neither. We're done being stupid.
okay. It's you and me, all right? This is it.
this is it. Unless we're on a break.
don't make jokes now.
okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
thank you.
if that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
I know.
seems smaller somehow.
has it always been purple?
look around, you guys. This was your first home.
and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter.
but more important, because of rent control, it was a frigging steal.
Hey, do you realize that, at one time or another, we all lived in this apartment?
Oh, yeah. That's true.
I haven't.
what about that summer during college that you lived with Grandma...
...and you tried to make it as a dancer?
do you realize we almost made it 10 years without that coming up?
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Oh, okay.
so I guess this is it. - Yeah.
I guess so.
this is harder than I thought it would be.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
come on.
do you guys have to go to the new house now, or do you have some time?
we got some time.
okay. Should we get some coffee? - Sure.
where?
you know, Monica's gonna freak if every box isn't labeled.
you're right. Yeah. Okay.
box of crap.
wow, it's wild. When Monica and Chandler come back...
...they are gonna have a baby. A baby!
I know. Oh, wait, Ross doesn't know the baby's coming. Should we call him?
I don't know. Rachel's over there yelling at him. Poor guy.
I would not wanna be him right now.
wait. Wait. Should we be doing this? - I don't know.
it's probably not a really good idea. - Probably not.
well, that never stopped us before. - No, sir!

I can't believe we're gonna be parents.
I can't believe it's three weeks early. I love that our baby is prompt.
okay. All right, what room did the nurse say Erica was in?
702. - Okay.
come on, baby. - Come on, Michelle.
come on. You can do this, baby. - Get this damn thing out of me!
well, these are for you.
did you see the size of the thing that was coming out of that woman?
I couldn't tell who was giving birth to who.
Hi. - Hey. How's it going?
it's okay. The doctor says it will still be a while.
how do you feel? - Well, it hurts sometimes.
not too bad yet, though.
it's a little scary. - I know. But hon, you're gonna be fine.
tell that to the lady in 702 with the toddler coming out of her.
I think that kid was wearing a shirt.
you're gonna be fine, though.
Hey.
go back to sleep. I have to go home.
Oh, God. This was amazing.
it really was.
you've learned some new moves.
Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me Sex for Dummies as a joke.
who's laughing now? - I am.
breathe. Breathe.
okay. Good.
next time, can I say "breathe"?
no. Last time, you said it like Dracula, and it scared her.
do you want some more ice chips?
no, I'm okay. - All right. I'll be right back.
where you going? - To use the bathroom.
you can't leave me alone with her. - What?
this is exactly the kind of social situation...
...that I am not comfortable with.
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with?
it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.
you'll be fine. You won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.
okay.
so any plans for the summer?
I don't know. Maybe church camp.
may not want to mention this.
so you ever wonder which is worse?
you know, going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?
what? - Oh, it's just interesting.
because no one will ever know because no one can experience both.
one of life's great unanswerable questions.
who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things.
like this.
come in. - Morning.
Hey. - What's that?
Oh, it's my housewarming present for Monica and Chandler.
that's a baby chick and duck.
and I named them Chick Jr. And Duck Jr.
I did not see that coming.
they'll love it at that new house. It has that big backyard.
when they're old, they'll go to that farm...
...that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
Yes. - Yeah.
it's a shame people can't visit there. - That is the rule though.
guess what. You're almost an uncle. - What?
Erica went into labor. Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now.
Oh, my God! - I have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.
Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.
have you seen him throw a ball?
is Rachel here? - I think she's still asleep.
how did it go with you guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.
we worked things out.
what's that smile? Did something happen with you two?
Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell.
but I'm also not one to have sex and shut up. We totally did it.
Oh, my God. You and Rachel?
I know, it's pretty great. - So, what does that mean?
are you guys getting back together? - Oh, I don't know.
we didn't really get to talk. - But do you want to get back together?
I don't know.
it was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right.
when I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go.
know what? Yeah, I do. I want to be together.
so is she still going to Paris?
wow, I hadrt thought of that. I hope not.
this is, like, the best day ever. Ever. You guys might get back together.
Monica and Chandler get their baby. There are chicks and ducks...
...in the world again.
I feel like I'm in a musical.
morning. - Guess you'll never know how it ends.
Hey. - Hi.
Hi. How'd you sleep? - Good. You?
good. - I'll bet you did.
would you guys mind giving us a minute?
sure. Just keep an eye on the chick and duck.
chick and the duck? Didrt they die...?
dive. Yeah, they dove. Headfirst into fun on the farm.
so...
morning. - You too.
last night was just wonderful. - Oh, it really was.
I woke up today with the biggest smile.
I know, me too. It was...
you know, it was one of those things you think is never going to happen.
and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.
I know. It was just...
it's just the perfect way to say goodbye.
just a little bit more, honey. - Oh, man, this hurts!
is it really that bad?
I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse.
the baby's head is crowning.
Oh, my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen.
Chandler, you have to see this. - I'm okay.
you don't want to miss this. This is the birth of your child.
it's the miracle of life. - All right.
wow, that is one disgusting miracle.
start pushing. Here we go.
here come the shoulders.
it's a boy.
is he okay? - He's just fine.
you did it.
it's a baby.
a beautiful little baby. And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.
would you like to cut the umbilical cord? - Okay.
well, that's spongy.
Hey, handsome.
I'll love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you.
we are so lucky. - I know.
he has your eyes.
I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.
we'll just get him cleaned up a bit.
Oh, my God, he's beautiful.
thank you so much. - I'm really happy for you guys.
how do you feel? - I'm tired.
you don't have that much time to relax. The other one will be along in a minute.
I'm sorry, who should be along in a what, now?
the next baby should be along in a minute.
we only ordered one.
you know it's twins, right? - Oh, yeah.
these are the faces of two people in the know.
I can't believe you didn't know its twins. This has never happened before.
well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.
did you know it was twins?
it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic.
did anybody tell you? - I don't think so.
they did mention two heartbeats, but I thought it was just mine and the baby's.
they said, "Both heartbeats are strong.
and I thought, "Well, that's good, because I'm having a baby.
this is unbelievable. - Twins actually run in my family.
interesting.
can I see you for a second?
what do we do? - What do you mean, "What do we do?
twins!
twins!
Chandler, you're panicking. - Join me, won't you?
what do you say we keep one and then just have an option on the other one?
we can't split them up. - Why not?
we could give each of them half a medallion.
and then years later, they'll find each other...
...and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody.
what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?
what if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
Yeah. Because I hear the king is looking to adopt.
Monica, we are not ready to have two babies.
that doesn't matter. We have waited so long for this.
I don't care if it's two babies. I don't care if it's three babies.
I don't care if the entire cast of Eight Is Enough comes out of there.
we are taking them home because they are our children.
okay.
okay. - Okay!
okay.
it looks like we're about ready over here. Come on, Erica.
start pushing again now.
here she comes. - She? It's a girl?
Yeah.
well, now we have one of each.
and that's enough.
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.
Oh, my God. What did you say?
nothing. What do you say to that? - You've got to tell her how you feel.
no way. - Well, you can't just give up.
is that what a dinosaur would do?
what? - I'm just trying to speak your language.
Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you even wanna get back together.
if she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.
you really think so? - I'm telling you!
Oh, this is the part of the musical where there'd be a good, convincing song.
Hi. - Can't a girl finish a song around here?
Hey. - Hi. I dropped Emma off at my mom's.
okay. - You're not taking her tonight?
we decided I'd set up, then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.
eight-hour flight with a baby. Good luck, Mom.
you kidding? Eight hours with my mom talking about Atkins. Good luck, Emma.
all right. You know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.
Ross. Wait, wait. - What? What?
could you get me a muffin?
Rachel? - Yeah?
I know you're leaving tonight, but I just have to tell you.
I love you.
now, I don't know if that changes your plans at all.
but I thought you should know.
Gunther.
I love you too. Probably not in the same way.
but I do. And when I'm in a cafe having coffee...
...or I see a man with hair brighter than the sun...
...I'll think of you.
Bye, you guys. - Bye.
Oh, my God!
unbelievable.
Hey, you know what might help? - I'm not getting you a muffin!
do you think they recognize each other from in there?
maybe. Unless they're like people who've lived in apartments...
...next to each other for years, then one day they're pushed through a vagina...
...and they meet.
we're going to take Erica to Recovery now.
there's something that we wanted to tell you.
we decided to name the girl baby Erica.
Oh, my God, that's just like my name!
son of a gun, it is.
anyway, I'm gonna go get some rest.
I'm really glad I picked you guys. You're gonna make great parents.
even Chandler.
okay, well, bye. - Bye.
we'll call you. - Okay.
have fun at church camp.
look at these little bunnies. - I know.
you ready to trade?
okay. - Okay.
okay. Let's see.
we could trade later. - Yeah, I'm good.
Hey, what are you working on? - A "welcome home" sign for the baby.
how sweet! Oh, is that the baby?
no, I sat in the paint.
Hey. - So did you talk to Rachel?
no. And I'm not going to. - What?
why not? - She's just gonna shoot me down.
you saw what happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.
how can you compare yourself to Gunther?
I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way.
you have a relationship with her. You slept together last night.
Yeah, and she still wants to go. It's pretty clear where she is.
I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...
Joe. - Damn it!
if I were gonna tell her, I don't have to do it now.
okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.
no, you don't. She's going to Paris! She is going to meet somebody.
do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It's a city of Gunthers.
Hey. - Hey.
what do you have there? - Oh, I made a little something.
if I had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but...
Oh, my God, you did that yourself? - Honey, that's gorgeous.
you know, the baby can't read, Mike.
Hi. The car service just got here. I can't believe they're not home yet!
I have to catch my stupid plane. I want to see the baby.
Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here any minute.
apparently, there's some big surprise. - Yeah, did she sound happy about it?
because my friend Ethel's baby was born with a teeny-tiny beard.
welcome home. - Oh, my God.
Oh, my gosh. - Hey.
Hey.
Hey, so, what is the big surprise?
Oh, my God! - How did this...?
okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?
Yes. It's twins. - Oh, my... They are so cute.
now, what kinds are they? - This is a boy. And that's a girl.
her name is Erica.
Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.
Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
Yeah, and we named the boy Jack, after Dad.
he's gonna be so happy. - Jack Bing. I love that.
it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy. You know, "Jack Bing, Morning Gazette.
I'm gonna blow this story wide open.
Oh, my gosh.
so beautiful. - I want one.
Oh, yeah? Well, tell me which one. I'll try to slip it in my coat.
seriously. I mean, you want to make one of those?
one? How about a whole bunch? - Really?
Yeah. We can teach them to sing, and we could be like the von Trapp family.
only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kind of dull.
I can't believe this. If I don't leave now, I'm gonna miss my plane.
I'm so glad you got to see the babies. - Me too.
I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this.
all right. Oh, I can't say goodbye to you guys again.
I love you all so much. - Love you.
we love you. - Call us when you get there.
I will. Ross, come here.
I just want you to know...
...last night...
...I'll never forget it.
neither will I.
all right. Now I really have to go.
okay, au revoir.
they're gonna really hate me over there.
so you just let her go?
Yeah.
Hey, maybe that's for the best. - Yeah?
Yeah. You know, you just... Look, you gotta...
you gotta think about last night the way she does.
okay? You know, maybe...
maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye.
they slept together? - I was with you.
now she'll never know how he feels. - Maybe that's okay, you know?
maybe it is better this way.
I mean, now... Now you can move on.
I mean, you've been trying to for so long.
maybe now that you're on different continents...
right?
maybe now you can actually do it, you know.
you can finally get over her.
Yeah, that's true.
except...
I don't want to get over her. - What?
I don't. I want to be with her. - Really?
Yeah. I'm going to go after her. - Yeah, you are!
wait! Wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!
my coat. - This is so cool!
I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!
what do you think she's gonna say? - I don't know.
even if she shoots me down, at least I won't spend my life wondering...
...what would have happened. Where is my coat?
you didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs. I'll drive you to the airport.
wish me luck. - Hurry!
good luck!
Oh, my God. Ross is going after Rachel, and you guys have babies.
this is, like, the best day ever.
why is there an ass-shaped paint stain on my couch?
she asked you a question, Mike.
you think we're gonna make it in time?
Hey, I didn't have my license taken away because I drive carefully.
there's no seat belts! - That's okay. If we hit anything...
...the engine will explode, so it's better if you're thrown from the car.
all right, all right. Let's do this. - Okay!
Hey! - 80th and East End.
no. I don't take passengers. - The law makes you accept any fare.
you don't understand. This cab isn't real.
what's your medallion number?
my medallion number is, get out of the cab!
what? - Get out of the cab!
Hey, you guys, check this out.
No! - Okay.
Oh, hey, can I give you guys my housewarming gift now?
now, that you can do. - All right.
I have a question. Without looking into their diapers, can you tell them apart?
of course I can. I'm their mother. - Oh, yeah? Okay. Which one is that one?
that's Jack.
Jack's gonna have a tough time in high school with that vagina.
chick Jr? Duck Jr?
don't hide from Mama!
you can open your eyes now.
are we off the bridge? - Yes!
is the woman on the bicycle still alive? - Yeah, she jumped right back up.
Oh, my God. Phoebe, slow down! - Do you want to get to Rachel in time?
Yes, but I don't want to die in your cab.
you should have thought of that before you got in!
tollbooth. - What?
tollbooth!
four bucks. There are quarters in the glove compartment.
Hurry!
okay.
damn, that window's clean.
God! Hey!
we were wondering what was taking so long...
...but now we understand. You were doing this.
okay. I wanted to surprise you, but...
for your housewarming gift, I got you a baby chick and a baby duck.
Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
Oh, great. Just what you want for a new house with infants. Bird feces!
but they must've jumped off the table. Now they're gone!
don't worry, we'll find them.
actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
Oh, God! What did I just step on?
it's okay. It's just an egg roll.
you stepped on my egg roll?!
I'm sorry. I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.
just put it on a plate and leave.
okay. Let's find these birds. - All right.
wait, wait. You hear that?
they're in the table! - Well, that can't be good.
we gotta get them out of there! - How?
maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?
Oh, tons. I'm quite the woodsman.
well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.
Joey, wait! The ball!
so, what do we do?
maybe we can open this up somehow.
okay.
no. It's all glued together.
does that mean we have to bust it open?
I don't know. Maybe. - Oh, my God.
I know. It's... It's the foosball table.
all right, you know what? We don't have a choice.
it's like I would have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd have gotten the part.
those are our men in there, and we have to get them out...
...even if I have to sacrifice the most important thing in my life...
...my time machine.
did that movie ever get made? - It did not.
Ross, where are you going? - To talk to Rachel.
isn't that why we took a ride in the death cab?
you're walking up to her at the gate?
have you never chased anyone through the airport before?
not since my cop show got canceled.
you have to get a ticket to get past security.
what? We're never gonna make it. - Not with that attitude. Now, haul ass!
okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.
Madame, your passport please. - Oh, my God.
I was afraid I wouldn't remember my high school French.
but I understood every word you just said.
your boarding pass, please. - Oh, sure.
shoot, I had it. Oh, I can't believe this.
Madame, if you don't have your... - I have it, I have it!
okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C...
...because that's my bra size.
you must have your boarding pass...
you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.
Hi. I need a ticket. - Just one?
I drive you here, and I don't get to see how it works out?
fine. Two tickets. I need two tickets. - We're on our honeymoon.
and the destination? - I don't care. Whatever's the cheapest.
I'm so lucky I married you.
Oh, shoot. Damn it. Where is it?
I found it. I found it. I told you I would find it.
in your face. You're a different person.
sorry.
okay. Flight 421, Paris.
I don't see it. Do you see it? - No. Did we miss it?
no, no, it's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.
maybe we have the flight number wrong.
God.
hello. - Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.
what?
Hey. Hey, listen...
you wouldn't believe the cute noises the twins are making. Wait, listen.
but Monica...
Monica. Monica. Monica.
I'm sorry. They were doing it before.
that's all right. Listen, listen. - Oh, wait, wait. Here they go again.
Monica. Monica. Monica.
Monica? - Isn't that cute?
that is precious! Listen...
I need Rachel's flight information. - Oh, okay.
all right, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8: 40. - I have that. It's not on the board.
that's what it says here. Flight 421. Leaves at 8: 40. Newark Airport.
what? - Newark Airport.
Why? Where are you? - JFK.
don't worry, you guys! We're gonna get you out of there!
and we're also gonna buy you tiny bird hearing aids.
okay. Here goes.
what's the matter?
I need to say goodbye to the table first.
I understand.
okay.
table...
...you have given us so many great times.
and you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel...
all of you guys. What can I say?
you guys make us look good.
you want to say anything? - I don't know.
except that, for one last time...
good game. Good game. Good game.
good game.
okay. Here we go.
I can't do it.
well, I can't do it either.
Hey. Did you find them? - Yeah. They're stuck inside the table.
and we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it.
Oh, well, sure. It's got to be so hard.
I'll do it. Give me.
Phoebe!
no, no, no!
wow, I've never gone this fast before.
Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is, like, an hour away.
there's no way we'll make it in time.
she's got her cell. You could call her. - I am not doing this over the phone.
you don't have any other choice.
Hello? - Rachel. Oh, good.
by the way, did you just get on the plane?
Yeah. - We would have caught her...
...if we were at the right airport.
Rachel, hang on. - No. No. No.
Phoebe, is everything okay?
actually, no. No. You have to get off the plane.
what? Why? - I have this feeling that...
...something's wrong with it. Something is wrong with the left phalange.
Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.
look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.
what was that? - Oh, that was just my crazy friend.
she told me to get off the plane because she had a "feeling" that there...
...was something wrong with the left phalange.
okay. That doesn't sound good. - Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
she comes up with this stuff, and she's almost never right.
but she is sometimes. - Well...
well, I can't take this plane now.
excuse me, sir. Where are you going? - I have to get off this plane.
her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left phalange.
could I get some peanuts?
what's wrong with the plane? - There's nothing wrong.
the left phalange. - There's no "phalange.
Oh, my God. This plane doesn't even have a phalange.
I'm not flying on it. - Please sit down.
what's going on? - We're getting off. There is no phalange!
this is ridiculous. I...
Yeah, okay.
all right. My job here is done.
that was impressive.
Yeah. You didn't even use the tools for most of it.
Yeah, they were just slowing me down.
all right. I gotta get back to the babies. See you girls later.
sorry about the table, man. - Yeah.
you gonna buy a new one?
probably not. No.
I don't know how much I'm gonna want to play after you go.
at least we got these little guys out. - Yeah.
we were worried about you.
I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?
I'm gonna miss these little guys.
it was nice having birds around again.
Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.
what? - Yeah. We got a lot going on right now.
and plus, here, they'd have their own room.
I could get a goose!
you know, I think you're set with the poultry.
Thanks, man. You hear that, you guys?
you're gonna get to stay here. And it's good...
...you know, because...
because now you have a reason to come visit.
I think there may be another reason.
so...
awkward hug or lame cool-guy handshake?
Yeah, well, you know, lame cool-guy handshake.
Yes. The phalange's fixed.
in fact, we've put a whole lot of extra phalanges onboard, just in case.
where is she? - I don't see her.
Rachel! Rachel Green! - There she is!
Rachel! Rachel!
whoa, do you have a boarding pass? - No. I just have to talk to someone.
I'm sorry. You need a boarding pass.
no, no. But you don't... - Rachel!
what? Oh, my God. What are you guys doing here?
okay. You're on.
what? What, Ross? Okay, you're scaring me. What's going on?
okay. Thing is... - Yeah.
don't go. - What?
please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please don't go.
Oh, my God. - I know. I know.
I shouldn't have waited till now to say it, but... That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry.
but I'm telling you now. I love you.
do not get on this plane. - Miss, are you boarding the plane?
Hey, hey.
I know you love me. I know you do.
miss. - I...
I... I have to get on the plane.
no, you don't. - Yes, I do.
no, you don't. - I do. They're waiting for me, Ross.
I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Rachel.
I'm so sorry.
I really thought she'd stay.
I know.
I'm sorry.
well, that's it.
everything's packed.
Yeah.
does this mean there's nothing to eat?
I put three lasagnas in your freezer.
I love you.
Hey. - Hey. Did you guys make it in time?
Yeah, yeah. He talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.
Where's Ross?
he went home. He didn't want to see anybody.
Ross. Hi, it's me.
I just got back on the plane, and I just feel awful.
that is so not how I wanted things to end with us.
it's just that I wasrt expecting to see you.
and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things.
now I'm just sitting here and thinking...
...of all the stuff I should have said and I didn't.
I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too.
because of course I do. I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
what am I doing? I love you.
I've got to see you. I've got to get off this plane.
Oh, my God.
okay, excuse me. - Miss, please sit down.
no, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane.
I need to tell someone that I love them. - I can't let you off.
let her off the plane!
you have to take your seat.
Oh, please, miss. You don't understand.
try to understand!
come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off the...?
No! No!
Oh, my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off the plane?
I got off the plane.
you got off the plane.
I do love you.
I love you too, and I am never letting you go again.
okay. Because this is where I want to be. No more messing around.
I don't want to mess this up again. - Me neither. We're done being stupid.
okay. It's you and me, all right? This is it.
this is it. Unless we're on a break.
don't make jokes now.
okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.
thank you.
if that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.
I know.
seems smaller somehow.
has it always been purple?
look around, you guys. This was your first home.
and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter.
but more important, because of rent control, it was a frigging steal.
Hey, do you realize that, at one time or another, we all lived in this apartment?
Oh, yeah. That's true.
I haven't.
what about that summer during college that you lived with Grandma...
...and you tried to make it as a dancer?
do you realize we almost made it 10 years without that coming up?
Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.
Oh, okay.
so I guess this is it. - Yeah.
I guess so.
this is harder than I thought it would be.
Oh, it's gonna be okay.
come on.
do you guys have to go to the new house now, or do you have some time?
we got some time.
okay. Should we get some coffee? - Sure.
where?
Oh, mein Gott, what have you done, Agent Hellboy?
look at this! Now we have to leave.
red. This is Princess Nuala.
lady.
we should leave. Now. Now!
let's go.

no, up there!

to wage his war, my brother needs this, the final piece of the Crown of Bethmoora and this map to the location of the Golden Army chamber.
the Golden Army.
the harbingers of death.
the unstoppable tide.
howdy Doody.
your Highness, if you hand the crown piece over to us...
no. Where it goes, I go.
my father died to uphold the truce with your world.
you must honor his noble intention.
the lady's in dire danger.
I take it you're vouching for her, Agent Sapien?
most emphatically. Yes, I am.
even so.
I am sorry, but we simply cannot assume such responsibility on our own.
the lady just lost her father.
what more do you want?
you may not care, but there are procedures, rules and little handbooks...
she's coming with us.
you got that, Gas Bag?
what did you call me?
you.
you will pay for what happened to my friend down there.
Yeah, right. You take checks?

it's going for water. Hurry.
Oh, dear.
no. No, no, no, no. No.
what the hell is that? - Excuse me!
stay back - Hey, what's going on?
we've got target in sight.
it's an Elemental, a giver of life and a destroyer.

a Forest God.
a Forest God, eh?
I'm gonna get me Big Baby.
somebody help! My baby's...Help! Help!
how can I help you, ma'am?
my baby's inside!
come with us, dear lady, please.
there's nothing to worry about.
we've got everything under control.
please. My baby's still in there! Please!
Hey, little guy.

shoot the weapon!
first praise the tail, kid.
you must shoot it in the energy ganglion.
the what?
the energy ganglion.
Scheisse. The head! Shoot it in the head!
Oh, crap.
you gotta trust me, little buddy. Okay?
you woke up the baby.
agent Hellboy, take the shot!
right now! Take it!
that's an order! Take the shot.
that's an order, Agent Hellboy.
shoot it! Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!

what are you waiting for?
this is what you wanted, isn't it?
look at it. It's the last of its kind.
like you and I. You destroy it, the world will never see its like again.
shoot it!
you have more in common with us than with them.
it's breaking free.
you could be a king.
you will not disobey a direct order!
shoot it! It's getting loose!
if you cannot command...
it will destroy everything!
that's an order, Agent Hellboy!
...then you must obey.
shoot it now! - Damn.
shoot it!
move back. Step back, step back.
it's beautiful.
and this huge monster just came out of nowhere!
yo, give the baby back, man!
Oh, what have you done to my baby?
the baby's fine.
you freak!
Hellboy, what'd you do to that baby?
the baby's fine.
don't move. Hands in the air! Up!
he's got a weapon in his hand.
that is his hand.
miss, stay away from him for your own safety.
he was trying to help. Don't you see?
he was just trying to help.
that's all we do.
that's all we've done all these years.
she's touching his hand!
we've just tried to help you. You.
you're a goddamn freak.
we don't need you around!
what a freak.

I didn't touch you yet.
you did a good job out there.
then tell me, why don't I feel so good?
I mean, I killed that thing. And for what?
they don't even like me.
I mean, they're afraid of me.
what do we do with that?
red, I don't want you to freak out.
I'm gonna leave for a little bit.
I need time to think.
about what?
can't you do your thinking right here?
look, I'll be really, really quiet.
I'll get rid of the cats.
red, why are you with me?
do you need everyone to like you?
everybody? Or am I enough?

Oh, no. No, no. I borrowed this book.
I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, no. Please, this is your home now.
you are safe here.
my brother will find me. He always does.
how could he?
our location is a highly classified secret.
Yes, but I know of it now, which means that he does, too.
we're twins.
even as children, a link has bound us one to the other.
something I cannot explain.
no need.
you look different.
Oh, do I?
perhaps my hair?
no.
it's your eyes. I can see your eyes.
Yes. Just trying a new look.
is that a map?
Yes, it was in the cylinder.
there are no coordinates.
perhaps there's a watermark.
you were very brave vouching for me.
how do you know I'm not the enemy, bringing me here?
it's as you were saying just now.
from intuition maybe, a link.
normally I'm able to read others quite quickly, but I've never met anyone like you.
nor I, like you.

you will learn to obey me, follow protocol and stay fockused at all times.
Oh, that word "fockused.
Yeah, with your accent, I wouldn't use it that much.
I knew Professor Broom, young man.
you didn't know Professor Broom.
Yes, I did.
after my accident... - Shut up. Shut up.
...he designed this containment suit.
a wonderful man.
and even then he was worried about your future. He...
Hey, Gas Bag, stop it!
right now.
or what? Are you threatening me?
because I think I can take you.
excuse me?
you heard me.
I couldn't hear you from all the way over there.
I can take you because you have one fatal flaw.
Oh, I wanna hear it.
no, you don't. You can't take criticism.
try me.
can't take it.
what's my flaw?
your temper. It gets the best of you.
makes you weak. Makes you vulnerable.
Oh, crap.
Johann.
Johann? Johann?
Hey, Johann?
come on, pal. Hang in there, will you?
Johann? Johann?
damn.
there we are.
your temper, it makes you sloppy.
try to control it, Agent Hellboy.
before it controls you.

Hello, Red.
well, you're up late.
what are you listening to?
Vivaldi. Il cimento dell'armonia.
I particularly like the last...
Hey, hey. What's that?
just a remote.
this? Yes.
popular Love Songs.
Oh, Abe.
you fell for the Princess.
she's... She's like me.
a creature from another world.
you need to get out more.
she's alone in the world. I wanna help her.
I need to care for her.

Yep, I'm gonna need a beer, too.

I think I have no tear ducts.
I wish Father were here.
he'd know what to tell you. Us.
I can't smile without you
I can't laugh and I can't sing

it's the last one.
look at her. She's it, Abe.
she's it.
she's my whole wide...
you know?
Yeah. Yeah.
I would give my life for her.
but she also wants me to do the dishes.
I would die and do the dishes.
why is she mad at me?
it's not because the room is dirty.
something else.
well, ask her, then.
no.
listen, Abe.
Yeah.
when a woman's mad about something, but she's really mad about something else, you can't ask because then they get angry because you had to ask.
do you know what I mean?
never mind, don't answer that question.
you gotta just...
Yeah.
...find out.
very quick of you. The parchment.
it was of no importance.
the cylinder is very interesting.
we will find the Golden Army here.
as for the crown piece, I know it's here.
I can feel that much from you.

I know what's going on with Liz.

Abe.
I'm sorry. He has to know.
Abe!
know what?
Why?
stay back. I'll go first.
Abraham. No, don't... He'll kill you.

Abraham?
you talk to him like that?
No!
I will kill you, Abraham.
and anyone else if that is necessary.
well?
then why don't you just start with me, Your Royal Assness?
who put those there?
and your weapon of choice?
five-fingered Mary.
you move and I'll kill your Abraham first.
red, you mustn't harm the Prince.
what?
if you hurt him, you hurt the Princess.
you've gotta be kidding me.
will you give me the crown piece?
no.
the piece. No.
Abe?
red, I'm so sorry, but they're linked.
what's going on?
red. - Liz.
red, behind you.
you may have mused in the past, "Am I mortal?
you are now.
abraham, many people have died for this crown.
he will, too.
if you want to save him and see her again, you will find the missing piece and bring it to me.
Jesus, Abe, pull the damn thing out!
I cannot.
every time I touch it, every time I come close to it, it moves closer to his heart.
I don't know what else to do.
the wound will not heal until the spear is removed.
we're running out of time.
then we go after the Prince.
and we make him take it out.
Hey, Liz.
you were asking me.
don't talk.
no, no, let me tell you.
I know what's important.
it's you.
red.
I could turn my back on the world, all of it, as long as you stay with me.
I'll stay with you.

the cylinder yielded coordinates to County Antrim, Northern Ireland.
the Giant's Causeway. Right about here.
great. So we know where he is.
what are we waiting for?
we should get going.
the Prince will demand the crown piece, Agent Sherman.
so we give it to him.
Dr. Manning?
I'm afraid it's not as simple as that.
hold on here, what are you saying?
the Golden Army must not awaken.
so, what?
you're just gonna let him die, is that it?
I'm sorry.
we called Washington. We have our orders.
and what about you? He saved your life.
I know.
I know this is difficult for you, but...
well, I won't let him die.
agent Sherman, may I remind you that I am the leader of this team.
Oh, there's no doubt about that, sir.
that is what you are, Dr. Krauss.
and if ever you were human, that time is long gone.
what's wrong with her?
you want me to call her back, sir?
let her go.
I understand.
what about you?
you find anything?
no. Nothing yet.
well, keep looking.
absolutely, sir.
all of you.
but don't worry, sir, we know it's here, and we're gonna find it.
when Tom Manning gets on the case, things get done.
they get done. They get done!
100%. I guarantee that.
even without the piece, we have to get him out of here.
we'll go to Antrim, and we will find the Prince.
keep looking.
I ask you, everybody, keep looking.
Abe.
just the two of us.
Yes. Yes.
let's go.
we need to leave now, before they run our clearance upstairs.
Guten Abend, meine Freunde.
do you have authorization to take that plane?
you're not gonna stop us, Johann.
on the contrary, I've been giving it some thought, and we should be able to save Agent Hellboy.
you say I'm not human anymore, but you are wrong.
I understand your pain all too well.
a long time ago, I lost the woman I loved.
and that was, in fact, the source of my present misfortune.
I will tell you about it one day.
but for now, the tactical advantage is ours.
consider this, the Prince lacks the crown piece and without it, his army poses no threat.
so we have clearance, then?
agent Sherman, Liz, screw the clearance.
we will take that plane!
Antrim, Northern Ireland, 09: 00hrs
it should be here someplace.
the entrance should be here.
I don't understand.
perhaps there's a mistake on the map.
hello there!
I bid you welcome, strangers.
how can I be of assistance?
we seek safe passage to Bethmoora.
and what does a nice little girl like you want in the nightlands?
we are looking for Prince Nuada.
him, I know.
trade me something, and I'll take you to him.
here. I have a shiny belt.
but I have no pants.
look, a wonderful set of magic eyes.
I already have binoculars.
but I see something special, something shiny underneath the bandages.
I want that.
no, you can't take it out.
not without killing him.
maybe I know someone who can.
will you trade me then?
all right.
very well.
keep going. Keep going.
Oh, my God.
you should have seen this city when it was alive.
what happened to it?
curse.
as soon as the Golden Army was stored here, a plague of silence and death befell us.
and the world left us behind.
for a long time, I alone dwelled in the dust.
all right, little girl, the two of you come inside.
the rest of you, wait out here.
Hello, old friend.
I have brought you visitors.
and I have a favor to ask you.
I owe no favor to you, goblin. Leave.
but I have done so much for you.
I have brought you many souvenirs.
and he has something shiny.
red.
something mine.
red!
Anung un Rama.
you know that name?
and yours. Elizabeth Sherman.
at last.
I have been waiting for you both many a winter moon.
I am his death, and I will meet him at each crossroads.
good. But when can I have that which is mine?
can you save him?
it is for you to decide that.
it is all the same to me.
my heart is filled with dust and sand, but you should know it is his destiny to bring about the destruction of the Earth.
not now, not tomorrow, but soon enough.
knowing that, you still want him to live?
so, child, make the choice.
the world or him?
him.
the time will come and you, my dear, will suffer more than anyone.
I'll deal with it.
now save him.
it is done.
I have done what I can.
now, give him a reason to live.
Hey, friend, what about that which is mine?
don't forget about me. What about me?
friend?
shiny.
listen to me, you big ape.
you have to get up.
you have to get up.
cause you're gonna be a father.
I become father?
well, all this is very touching, but if you still want to meet Nuada, we have to leave now.
ready.
here we are.
and there they are.
seventy times 70 soldiers.
sometimes I wish I'd never created them.
Bim-bam went the hammers!
whoosh went the furnaces!
and one of those fires took my legs off, now.
this is as far as I can go.
I'm not very good with steps.
but if you're here to stop him, the Prince, I wish you luck then.
the Golden Army must not awaken.
undo what we did.
we will.
you're here.
so I assume you brought the remaining piece.
no. We didn't, but we should discuss...
I'm not addressing you, Tin Man.
Abraham.
Abraham?
my sister is well as I promised, so... - Abe?
don't do it.
what the hell are you doing?
you would do the exact same for Liz.
agent Sapien, no!
I am Prince Nuada, Silverlance, leader of the Golden Army.
is there anyone here who would dispute my right?
kill them.
but...
don't do it.
he lied to us.
abe, old buddy, if we ever get out of this, we gotta talk.
open wide!
Industrable, my ass.
Hey! Throw me a bone here!
Oh, crap.
well, I'm out of ideas.
I got one.
I challenge Prince Nuada for the right to command this army.
you challenge me?
who are you to challenge me?
you are nobody.
you are not royalty.
Yes. Yes! He is Anung un Rama, son of the Fallen One.
he has the right.
a challenge must be answered.
very well then.
red, please. Red, Think about it.
guys. Guys! - He will kill you.
don't do this, Red.
don't worry, babe.
I'm not gonna kill him, Abe.
but I am gonna kick his ass.
red.
nice ride, huh?
you jumpy, slippery bastard.
I got you now.
kill me. You must, for I will not stop.
I cannot. - Sorry, pal.
I win.
you live.
Nuala.
the humans, they will tire of you.
they have already turned against you.
leave them.
is it them or us?
which holocaust should be chosen?
I never had a chance to tell you how I felt.
give me your hand.
it's beautiful.
we die and the world will be poorer for it.
Nuala, my sister.
all that power.
don't even think about it.
no. No, it's nothing.
I told you, it's a dead end.
what are you doing? Go away.
check the belt locator.
check the belt locators, over there.
over there.
you, you took that plane without an authorization, young man.
Hey. Manning.
here to help as always.
what's going on? What's going on?
I quit.
what? Are you serious?
looks that way, doesn't it?
what's wrong with you? You can't all just quit.
watch us.
on second thought,
I think I'll keep this.
come on. Come on!
Johann, they can't do this. Stop them.
Dr. Manning, suck my ectoplasmic schwanzstucker.
so what you said before, about us living anywhere.
guys. Guys!
anywhere. You and me. - Come on back.
let's find a place in the country.
I said come on back.
clean air. Green hills.
a yard with lots of room to grow in.
it'll be great for the baby.

Johnny, Daddy's on the phone.
Hey, Dad.

yeah... - Buddy, you there?
help me.
help me.
J. Edgar Hoover Building WASHINGTON, D.C.
damn it.
what's it been-- three years?
a-at least.
I haven't seen you since Quantico.
well, what are you doing here?
you're looking at the new Special Agent in Charge of the WMD directorate.
I am now one of the movers and shakers in the world of nuclear non-proliferation.
sounds exciting.
so... where'd you end up?
finally land that spot you wanted at Counter Terrorism?
not exactly.
I landed at the Office of the Director.

actually, I'm, I'm more of a handler for someone at the top of the food chain, but our, our cases are unique.

Yeah.

sorry to interrupt.
Dr. Hood, you have an urgent call from the Pennsylvania State Health Department.
some guy named Rigdon.
pittsburgh EMTs responded to a demolition worker found in advanced respiratory distress with multiple organ failure and other anomalous complications.
anomalous complications?
ones that suggest he may well have been exposed to a highly toxic substance, one not commonly seen.
right now, authorities have it categorized as a possible public health concern.
how serious a concern?
it's hard to say till we get the specifics, but it's definitely something he ate or drank, something absorbed through the skin, something airborne.
best-case scenario, it's an isolated incident-- one victim, one quickly identifiable cause.
and the worst-case scenario?
suffice to say, really, really bad.
so tell me about your old buddy Calvert Rigdon.
Cal spent the last eight years heading up the Pennsylvania Health Department.
before that, he ran the National Center for Preparedness, Detection and Control of Infectious Diseases at the CDC, and before that, he was fighting typhus and yellow fever in Angola and Sierra Leone.
pretty impressive.
actually, his most impressive contribution was when he introduced me to my wife.
whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area.
don't shoot. We're the good guys.
I'm Dr. Hood, Special Science Advisor to the FBI.
afraid you're going to need these.
victim's name is Christopher Fisher.
a member of the demolition clean-up crew found him this morning at around 10: 00.
he was dead by 11: 00.
what is this place?
native Americans used to bury their dead here for centuries.
early settlers at Fort Pitt did the same.
when the city expanded in the 19th century, it was buried under new construction.
the demo team rediscovered it while clearing debris from the old foundation.
personnel log says Fisher was a licensed mortician?
Yeah, brought in to oversee the proper handling of all human remains.
how long has he been here?
48 hours tops.
so... whatever we're dealing with is aggressive and fast.
initial contact to full-blown disease followed by death in a matter of days.
that's the good news.
take a closer look.
Oh, that's incredible.
it's behaving like a hemorrhagic fever.
exactly.
that sounds really bad.
well, only if you categorize extensive bleeding into the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract, followed by heart failure, pulmonary edema, and an agonizingly painful death as bad.
definitely bad.
what are you thinking?
well, if we're knee deep in the Congo rain forest, I'd posit Shigellosis,
marburg virus, even Ebola, but Pittsburgh doesn't have the same exotic palette.
it has to be something else.
like maybe a cave full of ancient, disease-riddled corpses?
Rachel, you may just have something.
I was sort of kidding.
no, I didn't mean about the corpses.
no biological contagion could survive 200 years without subzero suspension, but the cave itself, now, that's a different story.
you're saying the cave is sick?
radiation poisoning.
here? How is that possible?
in 1984, a worker at the Limerick nuclear power plant right here in Pennsylvania tested positive for nuclear exposure, but the source wasn't the power plant.
it was his own basement, where he'd been exposed to very high levels of radon gas seeping from the natural rock foundation.
the real hazard comes when radon breaks down.
when inhaled, the particles get trapped in the lungs and flood the body with toxic alpha radiations.
well, any one of Fisher's coworkers could become symptomatic.
we need to initiate HazMat protocol, start looking for air and rock core samples now.
what's going on?
somebody tell us what's going on.
I'm going to go introduce myself to the officer in charge, get a list of all the quarantined workers.
top priority. - What's going on?
my people are calibrating the radon sensors right now.
if that cave is contaminated, we should have confirmation within the hour.
let's hope it is radiation.
at least we'll know what we're dealing with.
media. Just what we need.
Oh, great.
the only thing that spreads faster than a legitimate health crisis is the panic about one.
what is the plan for dealing with the media?
well, lie, of course.
I'm going to let them know about the emergency preparedness drill we've been running.
Dr. Hood, radiation levels look normal.
do you believe this?
can they even do this? Is this even legal?
I got to get home.
they can't just keep us here all day.
radon sniffers detected only minute traces of the gas in the burial cave but not nearly enough to explain rapid-onset radiation sickness.
jacob, did you hear what I said?
we're back to square one.
deeply embedded pustules-- sharply raised and round in shape.
extensive blistering, most notably on palms and soles of feet.
confluent rash on face and forearms.
individually, those symptomatic manifestations point to any number of culprits.
but collectively they only point to one.
smallpox.
Smallpox-- I thought that was wiped out.
the World Health Organization declared the disease eradicated in 1979, but there are still stocks of the virus stored at two laboratories: the CDC in Atlanta and the, uh...
state Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, Russia.
how'd it end up in Pittsburgh?
I don't know.
the demolition workers are going to have to be inoculated, along with any law enforcement and first responders who have had direct physical contact.
that includes the three of us.
is that enough to protect us?
well, unique strains have, uh, unpredictable resiliences.
the vaccine has been enhanced with intranasal boosts that should protect us from anything airborne, but direct contact with infected fluids must be avoided.
words to live by.
I'm going to notify the hospitals.
it's a waste of time.
there isn't a medical facility within a hundred miles equipped to deal with this level of biorisk.
hemorrhagic smallpox is the most deadly variation of the virus.
it's highly infectious and efficiently lethal.
so what do we do?
we improvise.
double the magnification.
my God...
the tests were conclusive.
we got ourselves a smallpox outbreak.
a full diagnostic panel's going to take time, but preliminary mapping indicates genetic materials from multiple genomes.
a hybrid.
two viruses mixed together?
well, the toxin that killed Fisher was a combination of two distinct viral strains.
we have to find the source.
well, the cave is clean.
wherever Fisher contracted the virus, it wasn't here.
with every minute that passes, the likelihood of it spreading...
have additional victims becoming infected multiplies exponentially.
it's imperative that we determine exactly where Fisher caught this virus before this thing spirals into a full-blown epidemic.
landlord confirmed our first victim has rented here for the last five years.
keep a lookout for calcified scabs and flakes of skin.
I always do.
he lived alone.
the only thing his co-workers knew was that he was divorced, and had a daughter in college.
believe in luck, Rachel?
I'm in Pittsburgh dodging smallpox for a living.
how much luckier can a girl get?
well... Good fortune is the result of careful planning.
it's more of a statement than a karmic prediction.
can you make this kind of cash clearing bodies at a demolition site?
I don't know. Maybe he was working two jobs.
he was a mortician.
if he was juggling two jobs, he might've put the number in speed dial.
try number four.
work, ex-wife, kid's cell, second job.
jackson and Sons Mortuary.
your mask.
Hello, Mr. Jackson?
yes?
I'm Jacob Hood.
I'm part of a team investigating a serious public health matter involving your embalmer, Christopher...
I'd like you to tell me the names of everyone he worked with, and every dead body he worked on.
today's my son's birthday. He's nine-years-old.
we're, you know, throwing him a party.
check this out.
look at that.
I am going to destroy you.
you think he'll like it?
sure, what kid wouldn't?
I'm not going to make it to his birthday, am I?
they said we can go home soon.
they're lying.
keep us under control.
the government's not going to help us.
even if they try, they'll screw it up.
we're on our own here.
come this way.
just leave all your personal belongings right there.
HazMat's doing a full sweep of the funeral home.
Rigdon's waiting to brief us on the status here.
what's up?
how many workers do you count?
according to the foreman's report, there should be 21.
I count 20.
it's after 3: 00. I've been calling your cell for hours.
they took it.
what do you mean? Who took it?
it doesn't matter. Cathy, just listen to me.
something happened.
you promised John you would be home for his party.
there isn't going to be a party.
cancel it and start packing.
we have to get the kids out of here.
what are you talking about?
Ned, you're scaring me.
please! Cathy, just do it!
what are you doing? What?
you... You can't keep me locked up.
I haven't done anything wrong.
no, but you're about to.
you've been exposed to a very dangerous, highly contagious virus.
I want to see my family.
I want to see my kids.
I know you want to keep your family safe.
you want to protect them from danger. Ned!
Ned, listen to me.
you are the danger.
where are you keeping my husband? Explain to me-- Ned! Ned!
daddy! - Hey, Johnny.
wait, wait! Ned!
Hey, buddy...
this way, please.
I got something for your birthday.
daddy.
you go with these people now, son.
I'll catch up with you later.
No! No!
it's okay.
come on, honey.
you'll see your dad later, okay?
they won't even remember me.
they will, Ned. I promise.
Ned Warner's rash hasn't progressed beyond the macule phase.
so it's still in the early stages?
when it's least contagious.
that makes it highly unlikely he infected anyone else on his way home.
records from the funeral parlor.
we'll find out which corpse infected Christopher Fisher.
I'll oversee the decontamination in Ned's apartment.
these are the people Christopher Fisher embalmed during the likely incubation period:
Susan Crane, retired civil servant, 72, cause of death, pneumonia.
Gary Firth, doctor, 45, stomach cancer.
Jack Ruddock, maintenance engineer, 56, industrial accident in a cold storage facility.
my money's on the doctor.
the man dealt with disease for a living.
you just lost your money.
domesticated species lack a certain glycoprotein the virus needs in order to replicate.
excuse me?
the doctor was a veterinarian.
you could've just said so.
even vets are familiar with medical safety protocol, so let's focus on the other two candidates.
we need a full background check, dietary history, family illness, any recent travel out of the country.
who goes first?
the woman who died of pneumonia, or the guy who died in the accident at the cold storage facility?
when in doubt, always use the scientific method.
heads or tails?
Yeah, we can provide pickup service.
give me your address.
Mr. Pulido?
can you hold on a sec? Yeah? I'm your man.
you looking for some cold storage?
we're here about your dead maintenance man.
I'm going to have to call you back.
30, 000 square feet kept at a constant 25 below.
we're the largest public refrigeration facility east of the Allegheny.
all the big companies and universities store their perishables here.
what exactly are they storing?
ice cream to rocket fuel.
you name it, we got it in popsicle form.
that's giant bluefin from the Gulf of Maine.
over there, we got CO2 pellets for industrial blast cleaning.
and those, ice cores from the South Pole.
from Penn's Antarctic survey.
you can't be back there!
is this where Jack Ruddock had his accident?
Yeah. He was fixing the refrigeration unit and he fell.
osha's already cleared us.
do you know if he'd been out of the country recently?
Nah, Jersey was a foreign country as far as he was concned.
look, I've got to take this.
just stop by my office, let me know when you're done.
why does it matter if the victims left the country?
fisher is patient zero in this country because of our reporting system, but some countries don't have one.
and some countries wouldn't even tell us if they did have a case.
any chance they were in Latin America?
I want to know the villages in Guatemala they came from and exactly how long they've been in the country.
how the hell should I know?
hood, here.
Pathology's back on Fisher.
tests were conclusive.
it's definitely a hybrid form of variola major.
smallpox mixed with another virus.
I told the CDC this would happen eventually.
that we had to be more aggressive with our research.
but what do they do? They restrict my work. They slashed my funding!
Cal, I know you're frustrated, but I need you to concentrate.
we have to establish this strain's origin.
it came from Central America, obviously.
something new. Something manmade.
what did the lab report say it was mixed with?
an adenovirus, serotype 14.
that's a respiratory virus. Is that combation even possible?
in virology, almost anything is possible.
sorry, I cannot help you translate. That's not Spanish they're speaking.
then what is it?
best guess? Garifuna.
it's one of at least 20 Mayan dialects spoken in Guatemala.
great.
does anybody understand what I'm saying?
Comprende?
your fly is down.
your coworker Jack had a bad infection when he died.
there's a good chance he picked it up working here.
we need to know how.
her brother arrived in the city last week.
he stayed inside because he was too sick to work.
says he had a fever and a rash.
what else?
her village back home.
there were sick people there, too.
how many?
everybody.
don't touch anything.
Rachel, don't touch him!
everyone, stay away from this man and woman.
folks, stay back, please. - What?
they may both be very sick.
Rachel?
well, hybrid strains are notoriously resilient.
and given so many unknown variables, timing, antibody count...
20%, give or take.
what about Xicalal, the Guatemalan village?
Oh, we contacted the Guatemalan Red Cross and the Pan American Health Organization.
the place is being quarantined, so, we squashed a bug, Jacob.
it's over.
Cal, as long as Rachel and those people are at risk, it is far from over.
Rachel's a hero, Jacob.
whatever happens next, we must never forget that.
I want everybody's name when this is over!
payback's a bitch!
you looking for something, Professor?
I'm sorry.
for what?
you did what you had to do.
is that Ned?
no. It's one of the other workers.
Ned's hanging on for now.
how many have died?
hood, how many?
six.
we think their viral loads overwhelmed the vaccine.
maybe if we got to them earlier.
do you have the number?
do you have it?
Yeah, I have it.
I want you to make the call.
tell the bureau that your handler's been compromised.
tell them to send a replacement immediately.
Rachel, I don't want a replacement.
I don't care what you want. You're my responsibility.
you get some rest. I got things I need to do.
hood! Make the call! Do you hear me?
hood, I am serious!
it doesn't add up, Calvert.
what?
that apartment can't be ground zero. The timing's all wrong.
the Guatemalan patients are only now presenting symptoms.
that's a full 12 hours after Christopher Fisher died.
well, not everyone suffers at the same rate.
viruses react with ethnospecific variabilities.
even if the illegals are not showing all the symptoms yet, they may all be dead by morning.
so, we should write them off?
the way you wrote off the demolition workers?
I was being realistic.
I want Rachel removed from general quarantine.
until we have confirmation of infection, protocol dictates she be in private isolation.
we simply don't have another level three facility available for that approach.
the rules apply to everyone, Jacob.
even the people we care about most.
it not fair. It's just the way it is.
until the blood work comes back on the Guatemalan carrier, Rachel stays where she is.
is that you? Cathy?
I'm right here.
I feel bad.
it's okay. We all do.
no. I don't mean that.
I feel bad 'cause I'm leaving it all on you.
I won't be here to help.
you know, with the kids.
Yes, you will... Ned.
you just have to hang in there.
Yeah.
everything's gonna be okay.
this is the dead Guatemalan's blood sample.
so what we're looking for is the variola virus.
shaped like a brick with a surface like a ball of wool.
you've seen it before?
only in books.
in 1979, when smallpox was eradicated, the WHO had most of the live lab cultures destroyed.
since then, scientists have had to rely on computer simulations only.
you said the smallpox virus was brick-shaped.
that looked spherical.
wait a minute.
Rachel? Get Agent Young out of there now!
what? What are you doing?
he was wrong. - Who?
Rigdon. The man you touched-- he didn't have smallpox. He had chickenpox.
chickenpox?
I had chickenpox when I was five years old.
that means you don't have it now.
somebody get me out of this damn thing now!
I wish I could cheer, but right now, we're 12 hours into an outbreak of the variola virus, and we're no closer to identifying the source.
excuse me.
variola means smallpox?
Yeah. Why?
customers rent the space by the pallet.
nobody asks any questions as long as the check clears.
ice cores from the south pole.
Yeah, but ice cores are only viable in their original virgin state.
these cores have been melted and refrozen.
so, this isn't virgin ice?
not even close.
there... 567 alpha.
frozen water doesn't lie, Manny.
how about you?
you have any idea what's at stake here?
Jack screwed up the repairs on the fan.
fried the motor.
he and Pulido, they stayed late one night to move the crates to another area so everything wouldn't spoil.
their jobs were on the line.
you're not gonna open that, are you?
don't worry. Anything viral would be benign at this temperature.
don't blame me if something leaps out and eats your face.
well, that would have been better than this.
the samples are gone.
Pulido's gone.
he's taken the variola samples with him.
police and Hazmat have the city locked down. They'll find him.
the question is, how many innocent people will he infect before they do?
what are you doing? - Getting directions.
pulido searched the 'Net for the quickest route from here to the intersection of Fourth and Grant street 15 minutes ago.
pull over, sir, so we can search your vehicle.
turn off your engine.
license and registration, please.
sorry to disappoint you, Professor.
you knew that immigrant boy wasn't our source, didn't you?
the virus couldn't have come from Central America, because it was from your laboratory, wasn't it?
I wasn't sure at first, Jacob.
you got to believe me.
but when it turned out to be Adeno 14...
I-I knew it had to be one of mine. It was an accident.
an accident waiting to happen.
how could you store a deadly hybrid smallpox virus in a commercial facility?
if it wasn't my strain that got out, it would've been someone else's.
are you listening to yourself, Calvert?
you've killed six people.
you put the lives of an entire city at risk.
how dare you try to rationalization that to me!
we live in dangerous times!
and mankind has got to come up with better vaccines, more powerful treatments.
that can't be accomplished using computer simulations and theoretical models alone, you know that!
who are you trying to convince? Me? Or you?
was it Pulido's idea to move the samples or yours?
when we rounded up his workers he realized what was in the cooler. Demanded $75, 000 for it.
I was going to pay him, and I was going to destroy everything.
I made a careless mistake, Jacob.
eventually you're going to make one, too.
it happens to everyone who carries our kind of weight.
you'll understand one day.
are you going to have her arrest me now?
not yet.
first you have a job to do.
I want you to call your emergency response team, get them down here right now, and you'll help clean this up, Calvert.
you'll help clean this up.
I'm sorry, Jacob.
can't let him get away. - I wasn't planning on it.
Pulido! Stay where you are!
FBI. Everyone, stay where you are.
Mr. Pulido, don't touch anyone.
you're infected with the virus.
right now, there's a microscopic army waging war inside of you.
it's gonna invade your blood stream, attack your central nervous system and destroy every healthy cell inside of you until there's nothing left.
no, I got the vaccine.
too late to be effective
you and Jack were infected the night you moved the boxes.
no, Jack wasn't sick.
he fell and broke his neck.
he was the lucky one.
on the floor. Now, Mr. Pulido, or I'll shoot.
Hey, you stay away from me.
you need medical assistance, Alan.
I need my money.
listen to yourself. You're not making sense.
it's the virus-- it's affecting your brain.
ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna ask you to gently, quietly leave the premises.
no, no, no, no!
nobody goes anywhere until I get my damn money!
listen to me.
I want my money!
listen to me, no amount of money in the world is gonna stop this disease that's raging inside of you, but you might be able to stop it hurting other people.
now, if you stay here, you are issuing a death sentence to every innocent person in this room.
do you understand that?
I don't care.
I will shoot.
don't open it.
there's one vial missing.
it's done, Jacob.
Oh, Cal.
I ran into an old colleague the other day.
he's doing really well.
it made me so jealous, I could taste it.
and then, last night, sitting in that damn plastic tent, helpless, thinking I was gonna die...
made me question this assignment...
what I do for a living...
everything.
and...
and...
you're a major pain in the ass.
but you also do a lot of good.
I'm gonna see this through, make everyone else jealous of me.
mom, Mom!
that robot was designed by a NASA engineer.
it's got artificial intelligence, seven servo motors.
it dances, it snores.
it even does little electric farts.
that was a really cool thing you just did.
not really.
I also got one for myself.
energy restored.
McKinley...
easy, boy.
watch out, kid. - Sorry.
are you okay?
Hey, little man, come on. Try and get... try and get his helmet off.
what happened? Oh, my God.
God, he's not breathing.
Freddy St. John is the third 11-year-old boy to drop dead of a heart attack in the last four weeks.
otherwise perfectly healthy?
Yep. All the local doctors are stumped.
this town is desperate for answers, Hood.
welcome to Pooler, Georgia.
Rachel, look around. What's missing?
kids.
there are no kids.
something's put the fear of God in this place.
it's nothing to do with God.
people fear what they don't understand, and right now what they don't understand is healthy 11-year-old boys dropping dead from heart attacks.
how y'all doing?
Dr. Jacob Hood, Special Science Advisor to the FBI.
this is Special Agent Young.
Hi, there.
listen, no disrespect, but a lot of other doctors have been here and none of 'em come up with any answers.
well, I'm not actually that kind of doctor, but I'll bear that in mind.
well, if you'd like to step this way, the hospital administrator is waiting for us.
any additional EKG tech to 3 West.
additional EKG tech to 3 West.
we've had to bring in extra doctors from Savannah and Garden City just to cope.
every parent with an 11-year-old boy wants an EKG, a stress test, and a CRT performed on their son, whether their insurance can cover it or not.
can't say I blame them.
of the three victims, none of them had any indication of a genetic disorder or a history of heart trouble.
blood tests reveal nothing.
autopsies came up negative for anything other than cardiac arrest.
Daniel Harker, first victim, 11 years old, suffered from asthma;
the second victim Peter LaTerriere, 11 years old, was...borderline obese;
and the third victim Freddy St. John was an athlete.
11-year-old kids don't just drop dead of heart attacks.
this is my son Stephen.
mom, can I go home now?
Hi, Steve.
go wait for me by the nurses' station.
nice to meet you.
some of us parents have decided to keep our children home until we know what's going on.
the school really isn't up to the standards it should be these days, though few of them are.
we'll start at the school.
we need to check in with the office upstairs.
where are you going?
just going to take a look at something.
what are we supposed to do?
walk through the doors like normal people.
and the bear said, "You didn't really come here to hunt, did you?"
no, thanks.
that bear.
I thought I told you to wait for me in the hallway.
I'm sorry. - Sorry isn't good enough. You should know better.
and you shouldn't be spending time with these kids.
you get back to my office.
go.
I tell you.
I sure hope you and your partner can get to the bottom of this.
Dr. Hood is not my partner. He's my responsibility.
well, you must be Dr. Hood. I'm, uh, Charlie Craig. I'm the principal here.
d - Do you mind telling me exactly what it was that, uh, you were doing up there?
you got a CO pocket in your ventilation shaft.
um, a what?
carbon monoxide.
there's a, a dip in the shaft where carbon monoxide likes to accumulate.
I found a dead rat in there.
it was poisoned by the CO.
and, and you can tell that by... - Blood.
blood.
carbon monoxide clings to the hemoglobin and it turns the blood kind of bright red.
you see how my blood from before is much darker than the blood exposed to the CO.
and that-- is this what's killing the kids?
carbon monoxide is potentially lethal, but I don't think your leak is big enough to cause heart attacks.
however, it is a hazard. You need to get it checked out.
Rachel, Deputy, let's check out the rest of this place.
mom, I want to go back to school.
you will when this is all over.
who were those people in here?
the government sent them to find out what happened to those boys.
did you finish your homework? - Yes.
I'm going to walk home, okay? - Alone?
you have to work for another two hours.
nothing's going to happen to me. Honest.
you have your key? - Yeah.
all right, you call me when you get home. Okay? Okay?
I will.
Hey, get your backpack. - Oh, thanks.
running your environmental inspection of the school was the easy part.
what do you mean?
from here on in, every site we hit comes with grieving parents.
what exactly are you looking for?
anything that will help us learn what brought on Daniel's heart attack, ma'am.
mind if I, uh...
are either of you two into, uh, computers?
no, that was our son's thing, not ours.
did you find something on there? - No.
Mrs. Harker?
you should come and take a look at this.
well, it looks to me like, um, like Daniel was making some kind of video journal.
see, from all these entries here, it looks like it goes back a long time, maybe, uh, half a year.
show you how it works.
Trisha Gordon smiled twice at me today, and I think she switched places in line with Cindy Mollo so she'd wind up on my softball team.
girls are sort of stupid...
but she's kind of cool. - God.
Hey, Stephen, Jesse got it.
Yeah, just like I said I would.
you coming? - I guess.
Yeah. - Yeah.
I don't want to do this, Jesse. - Me neither.
maybe we shouldn't, Jesse.
I think it's dangerous. - Me, too.
Oh, chicken. Chicken!
come on, man. Do it.
show these wimps how tough you are.
he's too scared.
ha, ha, looky what I got for you. - Ooh, look at that.
lick it. Lick it.
come on, Stephen. Lick it. You got to lick it.
do it, man. Come on, chicken.
come on. Lick it. - Crazy, dude.
that's it.
you see anything in there that might be responsible for these deaths?
unfortunately, I haven't seen anything in this town that could be responsible for that.
it's Neal St. John, Freddy's father.
you about to head on over to my place, see what I got at home might have killed my son?
take it easy, Neal, come on. - That's your brilliant plan, huh?
take it easy.
sir, we're just trying to find out what caused the heart attacks.
so what do you got so far? - That's none of your concern, Neal.
Oh, no? Well, you're wrong there, Bill.
no, Neal, I'm 100% right, and unless you want to commemorate your son's tragic death by getting thrown in jail, you'll back off.
who the hell are you?
Mr. St. John, all that's important is I'm here to find out exactly what or who killed your son.
all right. All right.
but I can't wait forever.
go home.
maybe we can call a parent meeting at the school.
you know, you bring everybody together and you talk to them at once.
maybe.
just sit down. Just calm... Going now.
all right, let me just get this rolling. Sit down. Come on, everybody.
let us get it going.
bill, this isn't good, boy.
uh, can I have you two come down?
can't you see that you're not... - All right, quiet.
quiet. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet, please. Please.
calm down, everybody. Just calm down.
we're gonna get to the bottom of this.
we're gonna get to the bottom of it.
now, I want to thank y'all for coming tonight.
we're not interested in thanks.
we want to know if our kids are safe!
should we be leaving town?
I mean how are you gonna protect our kids?
now let's not get hysterical, but, all now, listen to me.
everybody, just calm down please.
now, the government is trying to help.
they have sent us a scientist from the FBI.
he's gonna help us. I want to... I want to introduce him to you.
his name is Dr. Jacob Hood. Dr. Hood.
they're waiting for us back in the auditorium.
no drugs or viruses.
no poisons.
no visible signs of bruising, trauma, or stress.
common denominators: same age, same sex, same school.
so what am I missing?
we came here to talk to the parents. So, don't you think that we should head on...
are you okay?
who... who are you?
we're here to help you.
I'm Dr. Hood, Stephen.
we met at the hospital.
I... I have to find my mom.
Stephen. Come on. Breathe deeply.
he's hyperventilating.
chatham County.
McKinley Elementary School.
we need an ambulance. It could be cardiac arrest.
mom!
Stephen, you scared me.
I could have lost you.
I'm sorry.
what happened? You never went home. Where did you go?
hello again, Stephen.
Dr. Hood?
that's right. How are you feeling?
Stephen, tell me what happened.
Stephen, who are you protecting?
get it off! - No, Stephen, don't!
he's terrified of needles!
can we get a nurse? - Right here.
thank you very much.
the tox panel shows traces of bufotenin.
what the hell is bufotenin?
it's a hallucinogenic, and it's more than capable of causing a heart attack.
he was with a boy named Jesse Freeman out by the swamp.
they were getting high.
he wouldn't tell me with what.
thank you, Mrs. Brown. That's... that's helpful.
Mrs. LaTerriere mentioned him, too.
Where'd they get the bufotenin?
you can find it in mushrooms, but more commonly in the skin of a very special toad.
that's a black swamp snake, Rachel.
don't worry. He's perfectly harmless.
that right there is just a baby.
yum, yum. Pretty damn tasty.
there's one right there!
hood, what exactly are we looking for here?
bufo alvarius.
Colorado River toad.
in Georgia?
that's the species that carries the bufotenin.
these kids must have got it somewhere.
this swamp is the closest thing we got to a toad's natural habitat in this area.
hello.
I know you.
I got him. I got him.
Ribbit. See, this little guy-- say hello.
when he's agitated like that, he secretes this poison, which is a hallucinogen bufotenin.
what people normally do is they...
they burn off the poisonous element, and render it harmless; then they smoke it.
but if it's harmless, then why did Stephen have a seizure?
well, I think what our kids have been doing is, uh, a thing called "toad licking."
you, uh, get him agitated.
kind of like he is now.
soon as he starts to secrete the poison, you lick it, get very high.
that's sick.
but if toad-licking caused the cardiac arrests, then why didn't the other boys test positive for the bufotenin?
Rachel, that's a very good question.
well, I got another one for you.
how does a Colorado River toad end up in a Georgia swamp?
that's simple. Someone brought him. But who?
I think we should ask Jesse Freeman.
he seems to be our local toad pusher.
I'm gonna ask you one more time, Jesse.
Where'd you get the toads?
stephen Brown almost had a heart attack because of it.
you give it to any of the boys that died?
no way.
I never hang with any of those losers except for school when I got no choice.
Jesse, why don't you do your mom a favor and be straight with us?
if you cooperate, I'll get the deputy here to keep you out of this.
tell them, Jesse.
all right.
I took them from Lizzie Summers' place.
I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.
just wanted to have some fun.
okay. Thank you.
what's Stephen's mom doing here?
Lizzie Summers has been in town for about three years.
she set up shop out here as a homeopathic pharmacist.
miss Summers!
deputy, how can I help you?
miss Summers, these folks are from Washington, DC.
they're here to help us find out how those young boys died.
special Agent Rachel Young from the FBI.
Dr. Jacob Hood.
TheJacob Hood?
I suppose.
I read your paper on dark matter.
unknown, "intangible, immeasurable and yet without it, the heavens would fall.
I was rooting for you to win the Nobel Prize that year.
Oh, well, if you were, you're one of only three people in the western hemisphere, - but thanks nonetheless. - Yeah.
do you grow, uh, sceletium tortuosum?
Oh, yeah, and kanna.
I use it as an anti-anxiety remedy.
Yeah, but it's much more than that, isn't it?
kanna goes back to prehistoric times.
early hunter-gatherers used it as an appetite suppressant so they could hunt for days without going hungry.
but show us where you keep your Colorado River toads.
you have quite a variety of dangerous animals and insects here.
well, sometimes the most dangerous venoms and poisons serve as lifesavers.
what do you do with the toads?
Oh, homeopathic erectile dysfunction medication.
I sell it over the Internet, along with other remedies.
miss Summers, we found bufotenin in the blood of an 11-year-old boy who nearly had a heart attack.
Jesse Freeman said he got the toad that produced it here.
I keep this shed very secure.
now, these...these toads, they breed like rabbits, so it's very hard to keep a head count.
now, if someone wants to take a chance and come in and steal one,
I don't see what I can do to stop it.
but if I've got to string up razor wire,
I might as well move back to the city.
Yeah, well, maybe if you'd stayed in the city all three of these young boys might still be alive.
what's up, honey?
mommy, why is Jesse so cold?
No!
God knows she's suffered a lot because of him.
nothing to what she'll suffer now that he's dead.
what were you doing outside the Freeman house today, Mrs. Brown?
I went to give that boy a piece of my mind and to tell him to stay away from my son.
then I saw that you beat me to it.
do you mind if I take a look at your bathroom, your kitchen?
Why?
to satisfy my... scientific curiosity.
help yourself. - Thank you.
through here?
no TV?
we don't have a TV. It's an unnecessary distraction.
did you find what you were looking for, Dr. Hood?
not yet, Mrs. Brown.
thank you. Good night.
well, that was an interesting response to Jesse's death.
I'll say.
I didn't find any environmental toxins that could cause heart attacks in children.
could you get there right away?
word travels fast.
Freddy St. John's dad heard about the toad venom.
went out to Lizzie Summers' place and busted it up.
I'm gonna go pick him up.
miss Summers.
we heard what happened. Are you okay?
no. Not really.
I don't get someone taking their anger out on plants.
deputy Larsson is arresting Neal St. John at his home.
no, no, I'm not gonna press charges.
I just... I can't be angry at a man who just lost his son.
I could use a drink.
want to join me? - Sure.
do you always wear these gloves?
whenever I'm handling poisonous plants.
poison? You mean, like Digitalis purpurea?
I didn't see it in your garden.
well, I don't grow it here. There's no need.
it grows wild all over the fields.
how did you know?
purple petals.
can you show us where?
there they are.
digitalis purpurea.
foxglove.
incredibly toxic plant.
several medicinal properties.
primarily, uh, heart medication.
why is it called foxglove?
well, it's an old wife's tale from medieval days.
they believed that the foxes would put their paws in the flowers to cover the sound of them creeping up on the chickens.
quite deadly, though, you get the dosage wrong.
I know what you're thinking, but you're wasting your time.
after the first boy died, I contacted the hospital and suggestedDigitalis.
Oh, yeah?
it didn't show up in the blood test of any of the victims.
well, that's our mystery then, isn't it?
just to satisfy my curiosity, do you use foxglove to make heart medication?
that's right. - And for?
anyone in town?
there's one person-- Sam Tewsbury.
the school math teacher.
well, according to Larsson, Tewsbury is well-liked in the town, and the kids love him as a teacher, but that wasn't always the case.
explain.
well, back in the day, he was the first African-American teacher at the school.
the grandparents of at least one of the victims wanted him kicked out of town.
right.
he took a lot of abuse.
could be motive.
avenging the sins of the father.
why do it now, after all these years?
he's old and sick.
he's looking to settle the score before he dies.
people get a little crazy in their old age sometimes.
sometimes at a slightly younger age.
it's called dementia.
and I could go at any time.
sorry this is all I can offer you this time of evening.
homemade lemonade.
thank you. - Please.
you have an impressive collection of early math and philosophy editions, Mr. Tewsbury.
Avicenna. Descartes. Rules For the Direction Of the Mind.
rene Descartes.
Oh, he was an innovator.
accept nothing as true that is... - Not self-evident.
and always recheck the reasoning behind every problem.
you have congestive heart disease?
something tells me that you know that I do.
you also use a homeopathic medicine that Lizzie Summers makes from Digitalis purpurea.
thought we were here to talk about the children I teach, Dr. Hood.
Yup. The dead ones.
who all died from heart attacks.
several witnesses place you at the hospital after each of the students' deaths.
I was concerned about my students.
they've been having a hell of a time.
and now, I'm going to ask both of you to leave my house right now.
thank you for your time.
all right, I want you all to copy these down and turn them in tomorrow.
quit it!
you suck! I'm gonna kick your ass!
Hey, break it up! - Fight!
what's gotten into you boys?
that's it! Quiet!
now, what's gotten into you two?
he started it!
he was kicking the back of my chair.
no, I wasn't, you liar!
quiet!
you know, I'm really disappointed in both of you.
I wish you were dead like the others.
what are you saying?
you kids know something about these deaths?
if you do, tell me!
you two ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
come on. Get out of here. Get your stuff.
we've retested Jesse Freeman's blood twice for every variation onDigitalis.
negative all the way.
are you sure?
twice.
best teacher in school.
well, we'll check that out. Thank you.
that was Lizzie Summers.
Sam Tewsbury ordered more heart medication from her, but he didn't pick it up.
she's been calling him all day. No answer.
Mr. Tewsbury?
Mr. Tewsbury?
Mr. Tewsbury?
he's dead.
thus Speak...
don't touch it.
what is it?
foxglove.
somebody went to a lot of time, and a lot of patience into sticking these pages together with it.
how are sticky pages gonna kill somebody?
well, it depends how you read.
but if you lick your fingers to turn the pages, you'll probably end up ingesting the poison that way.
Catherine De Medici, 16th century France, she used this method to kill most of her enemies.
I need to see everything the victims were wearing or carrying at the time of their deaths.
I'm gonna call this in. I'll get right on it. - Thank you.
Nietzsche?
someone around here is...
killing off the weak.
clearing a path for the Ubermensch.
the Over-Man.
I'm going to need some buff-tailed bumblebees.
in the bathroom.
here you go.
why are we in the bathroom, Hood?
cause we want a clean environment with no pollen distractions.
if there's foxglove on any of the victims' possessions, it's gonna be the first thing our little friends are gonna be attracted to.
here we go.
I think I'll wait out on the porch if y'all don't mind.
Yeah, that's a lot of bees.
here's your gloves. - Oh, thank you.
put your helmet on.
there they go.
they're going right for the foxglove in the victims' belongings:
tote container, asthma inhaler, lunch box, and Freddy St. John's bicycle.
foxglove was on all the victims' belongings.
so now we know what caused their heart attacks.
digitalis purpureadidn't show in any of the autopsies.
Why?
I want to do DNA tests on all the victims and their parents.
but don't have the hospital lab do it.
get your boys at Quantico to take care of it.
okay, sweetie. - Bye.
DNA results. Get this.
according to the blood samples this hospital gave Quantico, none of the dead boys are related to their parents.
that's ridiculous.
I've known those families for a long time.
seen most of them get brought home from the hospital.
I'm with the sheriff.
somebody must've switched the blood samples.
no...
hold on.
hold on.
What'd you find?
according to these DNA markers, all the blood must come from one pubescent boy.
maybe the school is the source of our deaths.
not the environment.
a student.
most of the time.
all right, settle down. Settle down.
everybody pay attention. Up here. Settle down.
all right. All ready for you.
thank you.
I'm Jacob Hood.
I'm a scientist, and I work with the, uh, FBI.
now, uh...
I met your math teacher, Sam Tewsbury, before he died.
as you know, Sam, he gave his life to this school.
before he died, he asked me to come up with a math problem for you as a sort of challenge.
he said some of you were getting too smart for him.
even though he's not here, I'd like to...
give you a chance to solve my problem for him.
Oh, and the winner gets a genuine pair of FBI handcuffs.
pay attention. Good.
so the first stage "F" of a rocket burns 25 seconds longer than the second stage, which we'll call "S.
now, if the total burning time for both stages is 145 seconds, how long does each stage burn?
anybody?
anyone?
no?
okay. Tell you what I'll do.
I will leave this on the board till tomorrow.
we'll just have to wait and see what you can do.
thank you very much. Back to you.
it's purple, Stephen.
but it's not foxglove.
actually, it's a dye from a Japanese indigo.
just a little taste of your own medicine.
except this plant won't kill you.
we need to talk about why you killed your classmates, Stephen.
he didn't kill those little bastards. I did.
mom.
shut up, Stephen!
Mrs. Brown, please step back.
I killed them.
I had access to the toxicology lab at the hospital.
I used Stephen's blood. I switched the samples.
every one of those kids was nothing but trouble.
they had my son drinking beer, getting high.
your mom's trying to protect you, Stephen.
she obviously loves you very much.
but we know, though, she wouldn't be able to whip upDigitalis from foxglove plants.
you could've, though. Couldn't you?
incidentally, uh, the deputies, they found your, um, chemistry kit.
it was covered in foxglove.
no, it's not his. It's mine! - No! Stop!
Mrs. Brown, the serial numbers on the lab equipment are from the school.
for God's sake, he's only 11 years old! He's all I have left.
do you understand that?
stop it, Mom.
you shouldn't get in trouble for what I did.
I had to kill them.
they were holding me back.
they were holding the whole school back.
the whole school was suffering because of those stupid kids.
because of how bad our overall grades and test scores were.
even some of the teachers were leaving for other schools.
somebody had to do something.
why Sam Tewsbury?
I saw Mr. Tewsbury in the classroom.
I heard him question the kids.
I was certain he suspected a kid was behind all the deaths.
it was only a matter of time before he figured everything out.
he was a smart man.
almost as smart as me.
so you sent him Nietzsche's book?
my mom's copy, actually.
it's her code to live by.
what doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
you took quite a risk, licking the toad venom. Why?
to blend in with the others.
throw suspicion off myself.
you drew your own blood, switched the samples and you made your mom believe you were terrified of needles.
I made her believe a lot of things.
when was it going to end?
when someone was smart enough to stop me, I guess.
did you know that the comic book, Superman, was actually based on Nietzsche's philosophy?
up, up and away...
how'd you like to be the court-appointed psychiatrist whose full-time job is observing little Stephen Brown for a decade or two?
I can think of worse things to do for a day.
so, Hood...
what were you like as an 11-year-old boy?
I was kind of like Stephen, I guess.
I wanted to compete with the best.
but it's hard to know how good you are, if you kill off the competition.
well, I for one am relieved that you used that brain of yours for good.
thank you.
maybe I just never got caught.
Chicago, ILLINOIS
are you all right?
you need to get out of the street, honey.
you need to get out of the street. Watch out!
watch where you're going!
keep moving! Go on.
excuse me!
kennedy Center, WASHINGTON D. C.
champagne, please.
I'll have the same. - Yes, ma'am.
here you go. - Thank you.
you do know it's free.
nobody tell you this is a charity concert?
well, it can't be that charitable if they force you to sit through the damn thing.
cheers to that. - Cheers.
I'm Jacob. - Elizabeth.
pleasure to meet you.
so what do you do?
I'm special science advisor to the FBI.
how intriguing.
job description would be...
well, scientific advancements have greatly benefited humanity, but...
if those advancements are abused, could be very dangerous.
my job...
is to make sure that never happens.
and what kind of science crimes do you like to handle, Jacob?
kind of classified.
what about your phone number?
that classified, too?
we have some place to be.
let me give you my card.
duty calls.
I always wanted to say that.
sorry to interrupt.
the FBI is holding two seats on a flight that leaves in half an hour.
so what's this about, Rachel?
okay. Teresa Kimsey. She's 16. Went missing July 7.
suddenly showed up August 9.
unharmed?
physically.
benjamin Gonzales, 15. Disappeared August 11.
reappeared September 8.
and Reggie Leinhart, 17.
missing September 10, back October 15.
when the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children detected the pattern, they contacted the FBI.
well, the approximate age is the same.
duration of abduction is roughly a month...
that's not what they're focusing on.
or why they want you involved.
all of the children are severely autistic.
at least, they were when they were abducted.
were?
now they're exhibiting symptoms of savant syndrome.
from mentally challenged to mentally gifted in the space of a month?
that's extraordinary.
when they found Reggie Leinhart, he'd carved 657 squares in the side of an 18-wheeler with a screwdriver.
perfect quadrilaterals.
benjamin Gonzales's mother found her recently abducted son frantically building that.
which means these must be Teresa Kimsey's.
I find it hard to believe that these children were diagnosed with Heller's syndrome.
it's a relatively rare form of ASD.
autism spectrum disorder.
I have a cousin who's autistic.
but he has a mild form.
so, what were you saying about Heller's syndrome?
well, it's one of the most severe.
a child can be developing normally and then sometime between the ages of two and four, they start to regress.
they lose skills that they've already developed like, uh, language, motor skills.
some of them even stop communicating altogether.
Savantism is an even more uncommon condition where a developmental disability coexists with an extreme ability in other areas like mathematics or art.
Yeah, I never understood how that works.
well... Okay.
um, wait. Wait. That's mine. Look.
this is an ordinary person's brain.
by ordinary you mean incredibly charming and full of personality.
ordinary people organize.
they sort things. They make connections. It's called logic.
now, this...
um, what are you doing?
is the brain... - Hood!
of an autistic person.
you see, although types and degrees of autism vary widely across the spectrum, most of them have trouble with connections.
the ability to organize that I was talking about. Now...
this... is the brain of a savant.
it's the ability to focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else.
now, if you have nothing but toothpaste in your suitcase, what would happen?
you'd know a hell of a lot about toothpaste.
exactly. You know everything there is to know about toothpaste.
you'd be a toothpaste expert.
the question is:
how does a severely autistic otherwise ordinary person become a savant inside of a month?
what happened to these children? And why?
well, we'll start with Teresa Kimsey.
she's our first victim, with the thickest case file.
and next time, use your own luggage.
I didn't know the FBI had a science division.
they don't. They have a Science and Technology branch
deals with all manner of intelligence-gathering and criminal investigation.
and then there's me.
is this Teresa?
Yes. She was two when that picture was taken.
she was such a funny baby, always smiling.
about six months later, she just stopped.
no more smiling, no more hugs.
sometimes she'd look at me like she didn't know who I was.
before we go in, I should warn you.
usually Teresa doesn't like visitors.
she can get anxious and upset.
but then...
she hasn't exactly been herself lately.
wouldn't even go near a coloring book before she went missing.
Hi, Teresa.
now I can't get her to stop drawing.
and not that I want to.
Mrs. Kimsey, would you mind if we spoke to Teresa for a few minutes?
well, actually, you see, Teresa doesn't really talk.
Oh, it's okay. She doesn't need to.
there was a 13-year-old girl with autism at Syracuse a few years ago.
she never spoke.
certainly didn't think she could read or write, and when they gave her a computer keyboard she typed out the words "I love Mom.
so Teresa's preferred method...
would appear to be drawing.
Hiya.
this...
is me. Sort of.
I like science.
that's an atom.
this is... Rachel.
she likes to beat up bad people.
and this is you.
can you show me what happened to you when you went away?
you were sleeping? Were you sleeping?
you're being very helpful, Teresa. Thank you.
what is that? Some kind of tube.
is that a tunnel? Were you in a tunnel?
Where'd they take you, honey?
is that a...
was she in an MRI machine? Were you in a machine?
you see, these are, uh, these are surface coils.
they increase the magnetic sensitivity.
and... these...
Rachel, can I have the sidewalk picture, please?
these are DTIs-- Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
dti is a specific type of MRI that tracks the movement of water through the brain.
Teresa, you're drawing what's inside your head?
but... the last time she had an MRI was when she was but five years old.
where?
well, the Autism Institute of Chicago.
we're meeting with the chief administrator, Catherine Bonatelli.
autism Institute of Chicago
both kidnap victims Benjamin Gonzales and Reggie Leinhart had MRIs taken here.
they were also five years old at the time.
that's got to mean something, right?
means we're getting closer.
I don't understand.
why are these children being taken?
that's what we're trying to find out.
well, I want you to know that the Institute will do whatever we can to help.
thank you. Rachel. Do you have the picture of Benjamin's sculpture?
these were taken of Teresa over ten years ago.
I hope they still pertain to your investigation.
miss Bonatelli, we'll also need to see the scans for Benjamin Gonzales and Reggie Leinhart.
excuse me. Do you mind if I take over for a second?
Oh, sure.
these scans are almost exactly the same.
even if these patients have the same type of autism, it doesn't mean their scans would be this close.
brain patterns are as unique as fingerprints.
you have so many kids with the same distinct brain pattern.
I'm going to need to see all the DTIs you've taken here.
Oh, I'm sorry, but we've confidentiality issues.
without express permission from every patient involved...
or a court order.
our facility's been taking DTIs since '94.
we're talking thousands of patients.
and if any one of those matches the three we just found, they're in real danger of being abducted.
so the sooner we get started, the better.
hood... - Yep.
I think I've got one. Scott Butler.
he doesn't have Heller's syndrome like the other three victims.
but his scans were also taken when he was five.
he's 18 now.
and they're almost identical to the others.
Yeah, that's a match.
if these MRIs were taken over ten years ago, then it's not these MRIs that the kids are remembering, is it?
no, I don't think it is.
I'm going to try Scott's contact number. - Yeah.
voice mail full.
we'll need to go check on him.
hold on. I found another one.
cameron Stewart. Five years old when he had the scan done.
now he's 16.
let's give it a try.
Hello? - Hello. Is this... Mrs. Stewart?
Yes. Who's this?
I'm Jacob Hood. I'm-I'm with the FBI.
is your son home, please?
Hello?
did the police call you?
no. Is he all right?
then, how did you know?
cameron went missing from school this morning.
all right now. We have to be real quiet. Okay?
don't want to upset our new friend Cameron.
Hello, Cameron.
you're going to be very comfortable here.
I promise.
missing Persons Unit is at Cameron Stewart's residence, getting a full report.
Dr. Hood and I found four more potential victims. Are they accounted for?
Yeah, they're all accounted for.
placing undercover units at each one of their houses, 24-hour protection.
Mr. Butler?
Scott? Hood, look at all of his mail.
there's at least a month's worth.
he's already been taken, Rachel.
taken and returned.
clear. Looks like he lives alone.
well, that explains why no one reported you missing, Scott.
Scott... we're with the FBI.
do you mind if I, if I just make a recording of that?
Scott, would you mind stopping playing for a moment.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
Scott, are you all right?
he's bleeding.
get an ambulance!
code Eight. Ambulance needed at 1468 41st Street, east of Michigan, apartment 307.
you hear that? - What?
music.
the same notes.
same as what?
full sentences, Hood.
hear that?
now listen.
same notes.
Scott's phrase used the same notes as a common anesthesia machine.
you don't need one of those to get an MRI.
I don't think someone was taking pictures of his brain.
I think they opened it up.
I don't think he was the only one either.
look at the back wall.
it's a clean room filter.
you don't need one of those to get an MRI either.
you only need them for operations.
time of death is 3: 47 p. m.
cause of death: rapid blood loss due to a trauma to the carotid artery.
cause of trauma: yet to be determined.
perhaps I can help with that.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I'm Dr. Jacob Hood. If you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at the body.
what is this about?
what are you looking for?
a scar.
would you mind if I, uh...
what kind of scar?
can I borrow a nasal probe?
right here. - Thank you.
this should just take a second.
okay. I got it.
there's the scar.
have you taken X-rays yet?
the operation was done through an incision in the gum, and then you walk the bone up to the pituitary gland.
it's a new kind of brain surgery that doesn't leave any visible scars.
wait.
you're saying someone secretly performed brain surgery on this boy without consent?
that's exactly what I'm saying, Dr. Fisher.
someone tried to alter Scott's brain neurons by surgically implanting some kind of microfilament.
that sounds risky.
the brain is highly prone to infection.
or you can nip the carotid artery during the procedure and the clot wouldn't hold.
one sneeze would dislodge the clot, and you'd bleed to death.
which is exactly what happened to Scott.
hood, Teresa and the other two boys could be walking around with these wires inside their head.
cameron Stewart could be undergoing the same procedure as we speak.
we need to go.
can you check the wires for serial numbers when you do the autopsy, please?
no problem.
don't send me somewhere else, please.
this is the third place that I've been to in this hospital.
now where is he? Where's Scotty?
I want to see him. I just... I want to see my son.
you're Mr. Butler?
do you know something about what's happened to Scotty?
what's happened to my son?
it was a month.
a month.
the most he'd ever gone without calling me back was two weeks.
I should've flown out to check on him.
why didn't I fly out?
it's not your fault.
yeah... Yeah, it is.
I never should have let him move away.
he had no business living by himself.
how long was he on his own?
I lived with him the first six months to make the transition.
he was high-functioning in terms of his autism.
he had been on his own about a year now.
he only wanted to be normal.
what did I do?
I promise you, Mr. Butler, it was nothing you did.
whoever took Scott would have done it whether he was with you or not.
still no answer at Teresa's.
I hope she's all right.
what is up with this damn traffic?
you okay?
I'm fine.
I just...I just keep thinking about Cameron Stewart, out there somewhere.
who would do this, Hood?
put kids through this?
what would their motive be?
well, some people believe that autism, specifically savantism, is like some sort of clumsy step forward on the evolutionary path to the ultimate potential of the human mind.
and if someone could figure out how to recreate what gives them certain advanced abilities while preventing the disabilities...
then you can significantly advance human intelligence.
how does sticking wires in somebody's brain do that?
by forcing the neurons to find alternate paths to their destination.
those alternate paths could be better paths.
I'll try her cell.
miss Young.
Dr. Hood, hi.
Teresa, look who's here.
she spoke yesterday.
she said,"Thanks, Mom.
do we have any ice cream?
and "Where's Bob?
who's Bob?
our dog.
Mrs. Kimsey...
um, we'd like to take Teresa to the hospital.
Why?
what is it?
she needs an X-ray.
no.
no, she's not going anywhere.
Mrs. Kimsey.
Teresa might have been, um, subjected to an experimental neural implant.
her health could be at risk.
but Teresa's never been better.
look at her.
I mean, she's talking.
not a lot, but she is talking.
she called me Mom for the first time in 16 years.
do you know what that's like?
no, I don't.
and that horrible month.
no, uh-uh.
no, I don't want to lose her again.
of course you don't, Mrs. Kimsey, but this is happening to other teenagers, too, just like Teresa.
one died yesterday.
another was taken from his home.
kidnapped.
his name's Cameron, and he's 16 also.
you see, the more we know about what happened to Teresa...
the better chance we have to find him.
I'm sorry.
she's not going with you.
Yes, I am.
I want to help you find him.
cameron's gone.
he must be hiding.
I searched his room.
he's scared.
it's not unusual for them to find refuge in extremely confined spaces.
I looked everywhere.
he's gone.
you okay back there, Hood?
you're awfully quiet.
it's nice, but I'm starting to worry.
there's probably only 50 or 60 doctors in the Midwest capable of this kind of surgery
maybe we should just visit them all and see if Teresa recognizes anybody.
you can't just go around confronting upstanding members of the medical community without probable cause.
why not?
I have to go to the bathroom.
you okay?
come on, Teresa.
you're scaring me.
what's going on?
you okay?
you're drawing again?
I suppose it is still her dominant form of communication.
Teresa, what is this?
looks like a pattern.
it's definitely some kind of sequence.
I wonder...
what?
synesthesia.
or, actually, a specific kind of synesthesia called grapheme.
okay, back up and start with the first word I don't understand.
um, many people with savant syndrome experience something called synesthesia where one sensory experience triggers an overpowering response in another.
like, um, every time you hear a door slam, you get a taste of mint in your mouth or vice versa.
Okay...and grapheme?
well, it's the most common type, where letters or numbers are perceived as inherently, uh, colored or textured.
so, like, an A could be red?
that's right.
okay, so she could be writing a name.
Yeah, or a place.
Teresa, do you mind if I borrow one of these?
seven letters or...or numbers.
could be a phone number.
it's hard to see what you're doing with all the graffiti, Teresa.
graffiti. Graffiti.
no, that's it. She's not writing around the graffiti.
she's using it.
if she's intentionally incorporating it, we can use it as a key.
that's brilliant.
okay, okay, Teresa, so the first color in your sequence is...yellow
what's yellow?
I got a four here that's yellow.
there's yellow scribbling over a four over there, too.
okay.
red's next.
these two Os are red.
it's not a phone number.
it's a license plate.
I have to be honest with you.
the very idea that you're considering me some kind of suspect is...
well, incredibly insulting, not to mention absurd.
this is your license plate number, isn't it, Miss Bonatelli?
and you got it from a girl who has a severe case of Heller's syndrome.
it may be a simple coincidence, or she may actually remember it from her earlier visits to the facility.
when she was five?
do you have any idea how long we've been doing research on autism here?
do you?
over two decades, and we still don't know what causes it.
right now, one out of every 150 children has autism.
that means one and a half million in America alone, and it's growing.
which means we'll have four million in one decade.
the research has to continue.
what happened to Scott Butler isn't research.
it's murder.
if that's the case...
I certainly hope you capture whoever is responsible for all this.
I can't believe we just let her go.
we don't have any proof.
proof?
it's obvious.
law is like biology, Hood.
you can't just decide something's true.
you got to dig up some dirt, find a few nasty little microorganisms to prove your point.
good use of a scientific analogy, Rachel.
Hey, speaking of digging up dirt...
I just got a text.
my friend at the Bureau who's running a background check for me.
it seems Miss Bonatelli did some consulting work for a company that was a cover.
a cover for who?
the CIA.
you weren't easy to find, Mr. Whittier.
means I'm fairly good at my job, Agent Young.
means you are, too, I may say.
must have friends in high places.
what we have is a dead 19-year-old boy and a 16-year-old who is missing as we speak.
somebody's operating on autistic children without their consent.
Catherine Bonatelli did some consulting work for you in '05.
I'm assuming it involved her work at the Autism Institute of Chicago.
if this person in question did do some contract work for us, those records would be part of our HCS.
human Control System.
but HCS info is accessible on a need-to-know basis only.
well, unless the health and well-being of innocent teenagers means nothing to you, we need to know right now.
if the person in question, this Catherine Bonatelli, did contract work in '05, it would have involved an interest in a common trait of autism: superior memory.
we would have used her as an easy access route for information, statistics.
possible test subjects?
never got that far.
people realized that it would be decades before we got anywhere useful on this, not to mention the potential for a public relations disaster epic proportions.
so, if this...
theoretical pilot study ever did exist...
it was shut down.
so, basically, you're telling us nothing.
if someone is doing what you say to these children, I'd like to help.
the Agency would like to help.
so, prove it.
when it comes to passing sensitive information, the trick is to make sure that you didn't leave behind physical evidence of any kind:
notes on paper, phone records, voice recordings, that kind of thing.
the best way to leak...
is simply lean forward and whisper in another person's ear.
what? What did he say?
Catherine Bonatelli's coded cell phone number
we can use it to trace her movements.
stay here. I'm gonna go check this out.
are you okay?
I'm okay. I'm okay.
but Miss Bonatelli isn't.
building was rented in Miss Bonatelli's name.
do you think she's our mad scientist?
no. No, she didn't even go to med school.
brain surgery's not the kind of thing you learn on the internet, no matter what they say.
probably wasn't her idea to blow herself up, either.
it's pretty clear there was someone else.
Bonatelli provided the test subjects based on the DTIs from the Institute, but I don't think she knew the medical details of what was going on.
or how far they'd go to cover their tracks.
no.
we've gone over the whole site.
she's definitely the only casualty.
what did you find?
he's nearby.
they weren't just doing the surgeries in this building.
they were holding them in here, too.
so, where's Cameron?
if he's still alive, they've moved him somewhere.
Hey, Hood.
or maybe he escaped.
I need an immediate door-to-door search for a special needs 16-year-old named Cameron Stewart.
Yes, ma'am.
have you seen this boy?
in this place?
no.
you're welcome to look around if you want.
we won't be long.
take your time.
he was here.
are you sure?
we have no other choice.
are you really going to do this at the hospital?
there's nowhere else left.
I can't believe we did that at the lab to Catherine.
we have to stop.
it's too risky.
don't think about the risk.
think about the reward.
now what?
we've got one clue left.
it's not here.
what do you mean, it's not here?
how do you lose a brain?
well, the brain is here, but the wires-- they were in a specimen cup.
okay, who has access to this area?
hospital staff, cleaning crew.
I'm sorry.
somebody must have made a mistake.
it wasn't a mistake.
the wires are gone for the same reason they blew up the building.
whoever's behind this is getting rid of the evidence.
I need to find out what the wires were made of.
the compound could tell us where it was made, and right now, we have nothing.
no. No, we do have something.
or more specifically, someone.
you're doing great, Teresa.
just remain still.
and thank you for helping us.
you're very brave.
the composite of the wires in Teresa's brain is primarily platinum.
as in wedding bands?
as in nerve stimulators.
they're like small defibrillators that are surgically implanted in the chest to shock the vagus nerve and prevent epileptic seizures.
if somebody's dismantling them to make neuroconductors, they're gonna need more than a few.
we need to find out what local hospital is ordering an abundance of these things.
hold on.
those missing wires.
it's not easy to swipe something from a hospital morgue without clearance.
you're right.
our doctor must have privileges at this hospital.
schedule: craniotomy/removal of/cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma confirm
I have eight doctors who requisitioned nerve stimulators in the last year.
no. Hang on. Seven.
that's strange.
Why?
it's okay. It's just, the stimulators usually go through the thoracic department, but I've got 25 of them assigned to a surgeon in neurology.
what? Why would a brain surgeon be implanting nerve stimulators?
what's the surgeon's name?
Dr. Edward Fisher.
the doctor who tried to save Scott Butler?
I'll have Chicago PD pick him up.
do you have his address?
don't need one. He's upstairs.
scheduled for surgery about 15 minutes ago.
nobody move.
put that down slowly, Dr. Fisher, and step back from the table.
you don't understand.
you don't know what I'm doing.
then tell us.
what are you doing?
trying to save my son.
your son?
he's four.
diagnosed with Heller's syndrome a year ago.
he's autistic.
so you're trying to fix him?
find some kind of cure?
who are you to say he needs fixing?
just 'cause someone's mind works atypically doesn't mean they can't experience happiness?
or thrive on their own terms?
in fact, one of those atypical people helped us find you, Dr. Fisher.
you remember your patient Teresa Kimsey?
I'm so close to a breakthrough, I can't stop now.
you don't understand.
I understand you can't conduct deadly experiments on other peoples' kids to save your own.
Noah deserves...a normal life.
I have to finish now.
get any closer to that boy's head, and I'll put a bullet in yours.
why was Fisher working on teenagers when Noah's only four?
our brain stops maturing around 15 or 16.
if you operated any younger, there'd be no way of telling if the changes were due to the operation, or simple maturation of the brain.
poor kid.
let's hope he has more family.
if they're anything like Mom and Dad, maybe not.
any news on Noah?
I wonder if he has an aunt, an uncle.
actually, I've filed for a friend-of-the-court brief for adoption.
not for me.
I love kids.
I'm a big fan, but all that traveling we do, along with all the scientific crimes and crises.
then who?
Mr. Butler, Scott's dad.
he has the experience, and, uh, I don't know.
it seemed like a good idea.
what?
that's very thoughtful, Hood.
sensitive.
what, scientists can't be sensitive?
she hasn't spoken in a week now.
I understand why they had to remove the wires, but I miss her.
she's still in there.
we're going to start therapy at the Son Rise Institute in Massachusetts next week.
we wanted to thank you for your help.
now, we wouldn't have found the bad doctor if it hadn't been for you.
you're an amazing girl.
[ man ] We are not alone.
forget what you think you know.
forget what your mother told you when she tucked you in at night.
forget the lies of our oppressive cabalistic allied governments.
behind this curtain is the very secret they do not want you to see.
the most astounding scientific find in the history of humanity!
proof of alien life! That's right.
go ahead and laugh, sir, but what you see inside this room...
will change your life forever.
it will haunt your dreams and harrow, yes, your very soul!
Yep. It's a cow fetus. - I guess so.
it does seem to have an awful lot of limbs.
it's mutated. - But cow? How do you figure?
it's upside down.
Oh, yeah. Cow.
Yep. [ Exhales Deeply ]
and I'm out 12 bits. - [ Chuckles ]
I really know how to show a girl a...
disgusting time.
[ giggles ] Oh, it's sweet.
poor little thing never even saw the light of day. Now it's in show business.
you manage to find the bright side of every single thing.
also, we've...
got this booth to ourselves for five whole minutes.
we're not alone, remember? - He's not gonna squawk.
tell me more good stuff about me.
uh, well, you're, uh-- You're kind of a genius when it comes to machines.
you always say what you mean.
and your eyes are-- - Yeah? Eyes. Yeah?
[ sighs ] And, um
I don't know how to, um-- [ Nervous Chuckle ]
Oh. Plus, every other girl I know is either...
married, professional or closely related to me, so...
you're more or less--you're literally the only girl in the world.
hmm. That's a hell of a thing to say.
I was joking. - Oh, no, no. I get it. I do.
back on Osiris you probably had nurses...
and debutantes crawling all over you...
but down here at the bottom of the barrel, it's just me.
no. That's-- That's not even-- - Well, I'm glad I rated higher than dead bessie here.
[ Kaylee Speaking Chinese ]
[ wash ] Oh, my God! It's grotesque.
Oh, and there's something in a jar.
scare her away again, did you?
uh, this may come as a shock...
but I'm actually not very good at-- at talking to girls.
why, is there someone you are good at talking to?
[ wash ] Do not fear me.
ours is a peaceful race and we must live in harmony.
[ inara ] Struck out again? - It's like something out of a fable.
I got this priceless artifact-- the biggest score of my career, and no one will touch it.
the Lassiter is universally known.
fencing it is like fencing the Mona Lisa.
well, wh
the Mona who?
you're out of your league. You should consider my offer.
I'm done thinking about that, and you are to stay clear.
I know people in the highest ranks of-- - Jabber, jabber, jabber.
I ain't listening. Just 'cause you helped out on the job, don't make you a crook.
and I will not have you jeopardizing your career over this.
the career you abhor and look down on?
I just don't want you in the way of trouble.
just take it as you like. Amnon!
how you been? - Malcolm.
an old friend's face is a balm in this age.
I read your wave. You holdin' some post for me? - Yeah. Got quite a haul.
you can sign for everyone, right? - Sure.
any packages for me? - [ Mal ] Don't know yet.
my food is problematic.
girl's a mind-reading genius, can't even figure out how to eat ice planet.
did you get everything? - Yeah.
they didn't have rounds for the Buhnder, but we're ammo'd up pretty good.
got a good discount on account of my intimidating manner.
this one's addressed to you and Zoe, Mal.
I don't remember ordering any parts. - The little one's for Cobb.
I got post?
might we all wanna step a few paces back before he opens that?
ha ha. It's from my mother.
so, do aliens live among us?
Yeah. One of them's a doctor.
my dear boy, I hope you are well
[ clears throat ] and that you get this soon in your tra...vels. Travels.
did you order any equipment? - No, sir.
thank you for the credits you forwarded. They have helped...
as Mattie is still sick with the--[ Chinese ]
I made you the enclo--" Ooh! Enclosed.
...enclosed to keep you warm in your travels.
hope to hear from you soon...
love, your mother.
how's it sit? Pretty cunning, don't you think?
I think it's the sweetest hat ever.
a man walks down the street in that hat, people know he's not afraid of anything.
damn straight! - Well, let's hope...
we get some funny hats too.
[ grunts ] - Oh!
Thanks.
I didn't know you were out there.
sort of the point. Stealth. You may have heard of it.
I don't think they covered that in basic.
well, at least they covered dropping your weapon...
so you can eat beans and get yourself shot.
Yeah, I got a badge in that. Won't happen again.
it does, I'm just gonna watch.
see anything interesting out there-- if you don't mind my asking.
about 30 troops behind those buildings. Mortars. No rollers yet.
I expect they plan to peck at us for a spell before they charge.
they had two scouts sniffing, but I took 'em down.
Wow. I didn't hear a single thing.
first rule of battle, little one...
don't ever let them know where you are.
Whoo-hoo. I'm right here.
I'm right here. You want some of me? Yeah, you do.
come on! Come on! Aaah!
course, there are other schools of thought.
Whew. Ha. That was bracing.
they don't like it when you shoot at 'em.
I worked that out myself. - Did you find Vitelli?
Vitelli's out of it. That bumblebee laid down arms...
at the first sign of inevitable crushing defeat.
can you imagine such a cowardly creature?
southwest corridor is open, huh?
Tracey, ain't you dead yet? - Through no fault of my own.
I really wanted your beans. - They're gonna come right through here.
they got rollers? - Oh, they got every damn thing.
how's the lieutenant?
Oh, started screaming all of a sudden about his arms.
Where's his arms? We had to go back and find them.
[ Zoe ] What the hell happened? - He ain't even hurt.
he's got 10 pretty fingers on his hands, like the most of men.
but he's screaming like they're gone, crying.
he ain't said a word in two hours.
he's-- [ Indistinct ]
sir, do we hold?
I don't wanna die here. Forgive me saying, this rock ain't worth it.
not our lives. - Everybody dies, Tracey.
someone's carrying a bullet for you right now, doesn't even know it.
the trick is, die of old age before it finds you.
[ sighs ] We can still cut through to the 22nd at the school system...
make a decent stand there.
well, we can't do any good here.
[ sighs ] I sure as hell ain't gonna lay down arms.
[ breathing Heavily ] Zoe...
you heard the lieutenant give the order to join up with the 22nd.
I did. - Round 'em up then.
[ grunts ] And you heard the lieutenant too.
I ain't gonna rat you out. Don't worry. - Ain't me I'm worried on.
if the lieutenant gets his mind back, this shouldn't go on his record.
ain't his fault he couldn't take it. - That's more than he'd do
[ whirring ] - Seeker!
incoming!
is it bad? Is it bad? - It's glorious.
come on! We gotta move! - I can't.
[ grunts ] We gotta run! Zoe, get the lieutenant!
[ Tracey ] I can't. Really. Go. - You know the old saying.
well, it don't make any kind of sense.
Zoe? - I got nothing.
but it's definitely Tracey.
you know this guy? - Is this a warning of some kind?
listen, Mal, you gotta get this thing outta my station.
uh-- - No, no, no, no.
human transport on a postal route is very, very illegal.
if anyone even knows I took a corpse in, I'll lose my franchise.
well, who sent it? - I don't know. There's no return.
how long has it been here? - Near a week, that's why I waved you. It can't stay here.
[Jayne ] He don't smell. - I know. Been decently preserved.
give me a hand.
we're taking him on board? - We are.
don't know if I see the percentage in that.
then don't strain your brain trying. Might break something.
we got it.
[ woman Speaking Chinese On P. A.]
what's going on?
did we get something fun?
you are such a boob.
how do we know he ain't plague-ridden or some such? - We know.
we don't actually. I respect that you guys have a history, but what are you doing?
if you want me to do a proper autopsy-- - Cut him up?
not just yet. Thank you, Doctor.
robot.
[ mal ] What do you got?
[ click ] - [ Tracey, Recording ] Uh, okay.
um, recording.
Hi, I guess.
this is a message for Zoe and for Malcolm Reynolds...
and I really hope you all are the ones listening to it.
I'll spare you the boring details.
I've fallen in with untrustworthy folk.
making a bunch of bad calls.
all that matters is I expect to be shuffled off...
and you two are the only people I trust to get me where I'm going...
which is home.
I'd like my body to be with my folks on St. Albans.
we got the family plot there and my mom and dad...
well, they deserve to know I died.
[ sniffles ] You know, it's funny.
we went to the war never looking to come back...
but it's the real world I couldn't survive.
you two carried me through that war...
and now I need you to carry me just a little bit further... if you can.
tell my folks I wanted to do right by them...
and that I'm at peace and all.
when you can't run anymore, you crawl, and when you can't do that, well
Yeah, you know the rest. Thanks, both of you.
Oh, yeah, and, um, make sure my eyes is closed, will you?
wash?
St. Albans ain't but a two-day ride, if we burn hard enough.
that might make your schedule a little-- - It's all right.
that's right gentlemen. You have been told tales all your life.
but alien races exist among us!
the proof is right inside.
you'll be amazed and astounded.
[ woman Speaking Chinese On P. A.]
can I help you?
you are an ugly looking little quim, you know that?
look, if there's a problem-- - So you have to be asking yourself, ugly as you are...
how repulsive-looking...
the guy that's gonna make you his little woman is gonna be.
hmm? I mean prison is a lonely place.
you sure as a hundred moons ain't gonna be pitching.
so what kind of sorry-ass troll...
is gonna get blue enough to grapple with you?
shudder to think. - I've broken no law.
transportation of human cargo, especially dead cargo, through the Allied postal system...
is punishable by 5 to 10 years on a penal moon.
Plus, you don't know this yet, but you resisted arrest.
wha-- Wh-- - Where's my body?
I-- I-- I don't know. - The dead guy.
he got shipped here.
and shipped back out, I guess. Where?
I never saw a body.
[ sighs ] - But wait. There was a crate big enough for one.
I mean, I did hand that over just a little while ago.
lovely. Who got it?
um...
here.
Malcolm Reynolds. Where do you suppose he's off to?
he-- He captains a Firefly.
y-you should be able to catch him if you leave now.
are you telling me to leave? - Well, no, no. I didn't mean that.
relax. You've been great. And I was just bluffing with that stuff about arresting you.
I mean, who needs that kind of paperwork? Skunk, light him on fire.
no. I-- I-- I told you everything. I-- Really!
no. Come on! Come on! I-- I told you! I told you what I knew!
what-- What are you doing? I-- I
tell anyone we were here...
warn Captain Reynolds that we're coming...
and you'll wish that we'd burned you.
Dong ma?
good.
boys, let's go find us a corpse.
[ Tracey, Recording ] I really hope you all are the ones listening to it.
I'll spare you the boring details.
I've fallen in with untrustworthy folk.
making a bunch of bad calls.
all that matters is I expect to be shuffled off...
and you two are the only people I trust to get me where I'm going...
which is home.
I'd like my body to be with my folks on St. Albans.
we got the family plot there and my mom and dad...
well, they deserve to know I died.
you know, it's funny.
we went to the war never looking to come back...
but it's the real world I couldn't survive.
[ exhales Deeply ] Ho-- Oh, sorry, Preacher. Am I making too much noise?
no, no. I was just... saying a few words.
don't know the boy's denomination, but
Oh, no, it's good. The Lord should oughta look after the dead.
you wanna do a set? I'll spot you.
I'm not so terribly in the mood.
Yeah. Most people is pretty quiet about now.
me, I see a stiff-- one I didn't have to kill myself...
I just get the urge to, you know, do stuff...
like work out or run around.
maybe get some trim if there's a willin' woman about.
not that I get flush with corpses or anything.
I ain't crazy. - Makes sense.
lookin' to feel alive, I would venture.
now, for psychology, that don't sound half dumb.
my kinda life don't last long, Preacher...
so expect I'm invested in making good sport of it whilst I can.
you gonna read over me when I get taken down, Shepherd?
Oh, I suspect you'll be around long after we're all-- - What the hell is she doing?
what the hell are you doing? - Oh, River, that might not be the best place
I'm very comfortable.
I guess we do all have different reactions to death.
I thought I was gonna die. [ Laughs ]
how could he possibly-- - Oh, well, the colonel was dead drunk.
three hours pissin'on about the enlisted men.
uh, "They're scum." Uh, "They're not fighters.
and, uh-- And then he passed right out. Boom.
[ Chuckles ] We couldn't even move him...
so, uh, Tracey just snipped it right off his face.
and you never seen a man more proud of his moustache than Colonel Obrin.
I mean, in all my life, I will never love a woman...
the way this officer loved that lip ferret.
big walrusy thing-- all waxed up. - Yeah.
did he find out? - Oh, next morning, he wakes up.
it's gone, and he is furious.
but he can't just say, you know, "Someone stole my mustache!" - [ Laughter]
so, he, uh, calls together all the platoons.
we thought he was gonna shoot us.
Oh, he's eyeballin' all the men something fierce. Not a word.
and he comes up to Tracey, and Tracey's wearing the gorram thing on his face!
[ laughter] - He had glued it on.
he's staring the old man down wearing his own damn moustache.
well, the colonel must've said some-- - [ Explosion ]
are we hit? - That's too damn close.
[ beeping ] - They're behind us.
fired over the port bow.
warning shot? - They coulda hit us.
feds. -This is Lieutenant Womack of Allied Enforcement.
you are in possession of stolen goods and are ordered...
to cut thrust and prepare for docking.
the Lassiter. - That was quick.
do you think Saffron tipped them off?
this is Captain Reynolds. I think there's been a mistake.
there's been a lot of mistakes, Captain.
the latest of which is you taking that crate.
[ whispers ] Crate?
um, we took in a lot of inventory today.
if something got mixed in, we'll be sure and hand it back.
I don't think we're your men. Let me check through the cargo. Is it marked at all?
I'd think twice about playing games with me there, mister.
I will blow you to pieces.
Oh, you do that, your precious crate gonna be in bitty shards.
now, I got deliveries to make, Officer, so you just lock onto my trajectory...
and I'll take a look here, see if anything matches your description.
police procedure has changed since I was little.
he calls back, you keep him occupied.
what do I do, shadow puppets? - We'll take care of it.
I don't get this. They're after Tracey?
unless there's something else in that box.
anything?
not unless this crate's made of magical wish-granting planks.
check his pockets. - That ain't right.
neither's being blowed up.
there's nothing about this sits right with me.
empty. - They want this body for something...
and I'm guessin' it ain't a proper burial.
well, Doctor, guess you are doing an autopsy.
[ Zoe ] You really think there's something in there?
using corpses for smuggling is a time-honored repulsive custom.
maybe it's gold.
and maybe he was a friend of ours, and you need to show a little respect.
I got respect. I'm just saying-- gold.
he's been opened before. - How's that?
it's, uh, good work.
scar's nearly invisible, but
well, let's see what's in there.
[ yells ] - [ Mal ] Get ahold ofhim.
spry for a dead fella.
settle down! Settle! That's enough! - [ Groans ]
he was cutting on me, Sarge! - I know it! I told him to!
you told him to? What for?
cause you were dead! - Huh?
Oh. Right. [ Wheezes ]
I suppose I was.
Hey, there, Zoe. - Private.
you feelin' a mite calmer now? - Yes, Sarge.
um, Sarge-- - Yeah?
I think I'm nekkid.
Oh, um, sorry for jumping on you the way I did.
I was a little confounded.
emerging from that state can be disorienting.
was it Bifodan? - Hmm?
can you bring that pan, please?
the drug you took to make it appear as though you were dead.
remember what it was called? - Never did ask.
guy who sold it to me said I'd be under a week or so.
he told me I wouldn't dream, but I did. I dreamt of my family.
you can take that. - [ Mal ] All right.
you wanna explain to me exactly why you got yourself corpsified and mailed to me?
what are you running from? - Running to, not from.
I just wanted to get home, that's all.
it's all I ever wanted.
except there's them that take exception to that...
to me leaving...
while I was in possession of their property.
What'd you boost, Tracey? - Was it gold?
more importantly, who'd you boost it from?
well-- - Captain, I don't mean to
[ beeping ] - We may have a medical emergency here.
this man appears to be in cardiac arrest. - [ Snickers ]
what? Tracey, you having a heart attack?
it don't look like he's having a heart attack.
don't pay any attention to your machines, Doc. They'll fib to you.
[ Chuckles ] Heart's just fine-- better than fine.
just runs a little hotter than usual, that's all.
my God. It's not just the heart muscle. It's everything.
all the moving parts.
that's what I took, Mal.
that's what they want back.
Tracey, are you gonna tell me what in the-- [ Chinese ] you're talkin' about?
sure, Sarge.
sure.
thank you. - So your innards ain't your innards?
they got scooped out, replaced every bit.
What'd you wanna go and do that for?
for the money. They're paying me to transport what they stuck in.
you're smuggling human organs?
they're grown in a lab. The only way they can move 'em is in a person. Not sure why.
because the technology's not ready. Blastomeres are unapproved...
likely unstable.
you're not just a carrier. You're an incubator.
I was supposed to be at the drop spot two weeks ago-- a clinic in Ariel.
they were to open me up, take out the goods, and put my own organs back.
so what happened? - Better offer.
another buyer was willing to go three times the going rate.
it's enough so I could get my folks off that rock they've been forced to live on...
set them up someplace better, someplace warm.
that's real nice.
[ mal ] But your better offer went south?
Yeah. I got myself in a little bit of a pickle, Sarge.
the folks I was working for...
must've got wind of what I had planned.
I, uh, showed up. My new buyer was dead...
and there were some men waiting for me.
but you got away. - Only just.
I knew they'd never stop looking for me so long as I was alive.
thought my chances would be better if I weren't.
so you died, and figured they'd stop looking for you.
Yepper. - [ Explosion ]
I think maybe you figured wrong.
I think they're about done being stalled to-- Ah! Aaah!
Mal, your dead army buddy's on the bridge.
he ain't dead. - Oh.
how far are we to St. Albans? - Five minutes from atmo.
Oh. Bring up the terrain specs.
Kaylee, get him outta here and strap in.
[ beeps ] This is Captain Reynolds. - [ Womack ] Reynolds...
I'm a dangerous-minded man on a ship loaded with hurt.
now, why you got me chatting with your peons?
Tracey, you go on down below. We'll handle this.
uh, uh, well, we're just seeing to some technical difficulties, Officer.
not interested, Captain.
I stepped over a lot ofbodies to get to that one you got in your hold.
you play this right, and yours won't have to be among them.
Sarge-- - The captain ordered you off the bridge.
come on.
we'd love to let you dock, but that last bop you gave us...
knocked out our fore couples, so we're gonna have to park it if you want the tour.
[ Womack ] All right, Captain. We can do this on the ground just as easy.
Yeah. Easy. There.
think you can do it? - Watch me.
attention crew. This is the captain.
sit down and hang on to something.
Oh. Oh.
uh, you okay?
so I-- I can let go of you now? - Oh, you can.
Yeah. [ Chuckles ]
all this hard banking.
when the gravity drive and actual gravity start working against each other...
it tosses the lunch about a bit.
your pilot's pretty wild. - He can thread a needle with this bird. He's the best.
that's good to know.
so are you and he, um
sweeties? Oh, hell no! [ Chuckles ]
he's married to Zoe. - Zoe got married?
Yeah. - [ Laughs ]
Yeah, next you'll be telling me she smiles and has emotions.
she must have been such a stone-cold-- [ Chinese ] during the war.
I think the sarge was even a little bit afraid of her.
now she's married.
well, that's good-- people making a life for each other.
[ Womack ] Had enough of this goose run.
don't need no tour of this ice cube. Now let's park it.
[ wash ] Just looking for a good spot, Officer.
[ Zoe ] What is it? - It's a little strange.
there's a fed station right here...
but our friends haven't made a transmission since they broke atmo.
so what about you? - Oh, you know, mostly just m
stuff like this. Always finding myself in one scrape or another. Yeah.
sorry to drag y'all into this.
danger is pretty much our business.
still, if you got put in a bad spot at all, Kaylee, I
I'd be real unhappy.
get ready for hard burn!
they'd be crazy to follow us in here.
they're not behind us anymore!
I didn't think of that.
this kind of flying really wakes up a guy. - Awake helps.
[ engines Whirring Down ] - There.
I shut down the main power. They might not read our auxiliary under all this.
[ mal ] What if they come down, try to get a visual?
Mal, she's not a small ship.
we're not moving. Why aren't we moving?
probably part of some genius plan to give the feds the slip.
Yeah. Probably. - [ Distant Explosion ]
what was that?
[ distant Explosion ] - Sounds like full-yield mag drops.
I think they picked up a little triangulation in cop school.
river? - Shh. I'm counting between the lightning and the thunder...
to see if the storm's coming or going.
options?
well, we're only as good as long as the roof holds out.
direct hit above us, ship's electrics will be fried. We'll have to climb out.
Yeah, or get dug out. - [ Explosion ]
they're getting closer.
captain, there is another way.
uh, Captain said to stay put?
I just wanna see what's happening.
we're cornered, outgunned.
it's only a matter of time before they find us-- what's left of us.
let's not wait for that to happen. - [ Zoe ] What are you saying?
I'm saying we make good on what we said we were gonna do.
let's call them...
fly out of this canyon, let 'em board.
[Jayne ] Give ourselves up. - It's our only choice.
we let these men board, we're taking an awful chance.
these boys ain't playing, Preacher. - I'm aware of that.
[ wash Speaks Chinese ] That one was really close.
that tears it. I'm with the preacher. I ain't gettin' snowed in permanent...
on account of somejackass kid.
[ explosion ] - It's the only option, Captain.
wash, call the cops. Tell 'em we give up.
no, thank you.
Tracey, what are you doing?
I said, "No.
those bastards up there are wantin' to yank out this million-credit meat...
and leave me bleedin'.
now, turn off that radio. - [ Explosion ]
rotten twerp's gonna get us killed.
Oh, don't you move! Don't anybody move!
all right. We need to power up. We need to run. Now!
put that thing down, boy. You have no idea-- - Aw, shut it, Shepherd!
or I swear to your God, I will shoot you dead if you do not.
Sarge, Zoe, what are you doing with this Bible-thumper?
[ explosion ] - Wash, call the cops.
but-- - I'll kill him. I'll put a hole right through him.
you mailed your ugly business to Zoe and me, Tracey.
cash on delivery.
I'll go to hell before I watch you turn and bite us for the favor.
wash, call 'em up. Tell them we'll meet 'em topside.
no, thank you!
do it.
No! - [ Second Gunshot ]
y-you shot me. - Damn right.
[ mal ] That's enough shooting. - Wash!
Ow. - Everybody calm down.
Kaylee, get outta there!
Oh! - You're a rabbit, Mal!
Yep, yep, yep, yep. Hurry, hurry.
I probably scared you back there a little bit, didn't I?
did you see the look on his face? It was great.
you're really bleedin'.
Yep. They shot me. - W-Why?
[ explosion ] - Because they w-- They wanna sell me off.
you won't let them do that, will you, Kaylee, because, you know...
I think you and I really had a moment back there.
Tracey. - You know, Kaylee, I need you to fly me outta here.
can we take this shuttle and just go? - I ain't going anywhere with you.
nobody's going anywhere, Private.
Whoa! Captain, what is going on?
don't make me. - [ Explosion ]
far as I can see, no one's made you do anything.
you brought this on yourself.
got in over your head with those stone-cold gut-runners.
then you panicked, brought the whole mess down on all of us.
that ain't what happened. - Ah, yes, That's what happened.
starting to think that trail of bodies Womack was talking about
I'm thinking some of that trail was left by you.
and you ain't left a trail of bodies, work you do?
hmm? 'Cause your rep speaks elsewise.
weren't bodies of people helping me out.
and you're helping out lots, 'cause I needed a chest wound.
that can be seen to. - Do you think I'm stupid?
in every way possible. - [ Explosion ]
do you know why I picked you and Zoe? Because you're saps.
[ Chuckles ] You reppin' out as stone killers...
but I still remember the old sarge...
with his stories and his homilies of glory and honor.
maybe you should have listened. - Yeah? Well, what are you now?
what are we now, Mal?
see there? You hear that quiet?
means the call's already been made.
well, that call
that call means you just murdered me.
no, son.
[ groaning Continues ] - You murdered yourself.
I just carried the bullet a while.
well, now...
somebody left the dog off the leash.
I've been shot too many times to be scared by a gun, boy.
Womack, I think I broke your junk.
little problem during shipping.
don't think I have to tell you folk the kinda trouble you're in.
wetware smuggling...
resisting, fleeing an officer of the law.
I'm sure a search of this ship will come up with another few felonies.
you won't be searching the ship, Womack.
that so? - [ Book ] It is.
you won't be taking us in, nor the boy who's dying up there.
I'm authorized to kill as I like...
shepherds notwithstanding.
why is it you didn't call in for backup?
there's a fed station 80 miles from where you're standing.
you got your command stripes at the Silver Hold colonies.
puts you about eight sectors away from your jurisdiction.
since you're running this job on the side...
you took pains to keep your presence here a secret.
I don't imagine it would bother anyone...
if we laid your bodies to rest at the bottom of one of these canyons.
it's damaged goods anyhow.
that hat makes you look like an idiot.
[ coughs ] So, that was the plan?
that was, uh-- That was a good plan.
[ wheezes ] - I think so.
um, you
you weren't that far off about me being stupid and I
I never could get my life working right...
not once after the war.
Kaylee, um, I'm so sorry. I-- I didn't
Sarge. - Right here.
you-- that stupid message of mine...
and I was trying to play you guys.
and now-- [ Whimpers ]
you'll-- You'll do it? You'll-- You'll get me home?
Yeah. - [ Exhales Deeply ]
Yeah. You know the old saying.
when you can't run, you crawl...
and when you can't crawl, you
when you can't do that
you find someone to carry you.
[ Tracey ] You know, it's funny.
we went to the war never looking to come back.
but it's the real world I couldn't survive.
[ Tracey Continues ] You two carried me through that war...
and now I need you to carry me just a little bit further... if you can.
tell my folks I wanted to do right by them...
and that I'm at peace and all.
when you can't run anymore, you crawl, and when you can't do that, well
Yeah, you know the rest.
GRR! Arrgh!
shall I taKe it out?
no, that's not necessary.
some other time.
please wrap them as a birthday present.
thank you. That will be 10, 300 yen.
I've got it.

let's go now. This is embarrassing.
I have a 17 year old daughter. She's in high school.
my wife is an old hag.
I used to love her. But now I have other desires.
I put money aside for this.
hell! How old are you?
seventeen. No eighteen. I don't have the body of a fifteen year old anymore.
seventeen year olds don't have wrinKles, grandma!
I read that 38 year olds are playing this game.
I want a young girl, dammit!
I also have used panties and other treats. I can introduce my school friends, too.
you sound so sweet. How old are you? Me? I'm 38.
I'll maKe you happy.

I'm ruined. My age is starting to show now.
I can't survive as a call girl any more.

his wife?

they're almost the same. Both have a safety locK.
what's the effect?
it outputs a maximum of 200, 000 volts.
it'll KnocK 'em out but it won't Kill them.
sure about that?
it's not for Killing, it's just for protection.
you need something else to Kill 'em.
I'll taKe this one.
200 thousand volts, OK. That'll be 18, 800 yen.
thank you for coming. - Excuse me.
I can't get this off.
one moment, please.
certainly, Madam. This way, please.
got the money?
Yes.
get in.
the old man's brought the money.

Where's the contract? - I'll get it now.
they Killed my wife.

it wasn't my doing.
here's the contract.

I don't want it. Will you buy it?

which way? - Go right!
run!
where to? - This way!
damn good pussy!
can't we stop. I'm tired. - You're still young.
I'm not in your gang. I just want a share.
but I thought... - We're not.
you didn't start out with masKs...
but we all ended up wearing them!
aren't you scared?
let's split the loot.
not around here.
shouldn't we fence the jewels first?
there's none for you.
can I get a share?
sure. - But you grabbed it.
we all did.
I'll get a taxi.
she's got a car nearby.
how did you Know? - I saw you buying the stun gun.
where are we going?
how can we fence the jewels?
we'll get more if they're sold in bulK.
where can we sell them?
let's all thinK. - You go bacK.
this way.
I don't trust you. You'll tell the cops.
No! You saved my life.
where is she? It's been an hour!
she won't call. She's gone by now.
that's enough!
stop repeating it.
what's that?
it's your fault. She's your girl!
shut the fucK up!
stop fighting!
I'm dying! call an ambulance.
I'll remove the bullet.
fucking wait!
if the Boss hears about this, we're all dead!
that's her!
where are you now?
sorry, I was expecting someone else.
the Boss is dead. Get over here now!

I told you to do it.
sorry, Boss.
only two guns left. What's our excuse?
say we lost 'em doing a job for the Boss.
what's it to be?
them or us?
you're in charge. TaKe one man with you.
it's too big for just two of us.
you still don't get it.
you get the man who Killed your Boss, or you die.
don't taKe it lightly.
sorry, sir. ThanK you.
you motherfucKer! I'll Kill you.
cut up the bodies before you dump them at sea.
the gas maKes them float otherwise.
she wants to go.
Yeah, sure. ThanKs for calling us, Kid.

stop changing the subject.
over there.
I'll go get some medicine.
I'll taKe a piss.
what'll happen, huh?
it's raining.
rain! The Boss is weeping.
no lights. I bet it's closed.
what's wrong? - It's closed.
when did you get here? - just now.
maybe they're rebuilding?
this is too spooKy!
this ain't the time. Yoshida's dying.
then we get more loot.
I'm horny as hell.
stop fighting me.
it's closed.
so why are lights on?
ask the ghosts!
you go first. Which way?
that way.
what's wrong? - Where have you been?
peeing. I couldn't wait. - Nor me.
where is it? - Over there.
I've got to go, too.
is anybody here?
that's good. Let's share it out.
look at it all! How much is it worth?
a billion yen.
ten billion.
Really? So much?
I wouldn't buy it.
but since it's a present!
let's dance.
stop it! The security monitors are on.
God, I hate amateurs.
when the light's off, so's the camera, right?
well... Yes.

I'm SaKi.
I was raped once. Since then, I hate men.
you looK liKe a cop with that nightsticK.
I'm Shiho.
I used to be a housewife.
past tense?
next!
I'm Sayuri. I'm only 18 years old.
I'm on the loose. My man just ditched me.
I'm chihiro. You've all Kidnapped me.
what's in the bag?
Why?
I want to Know. - No way!
what's that?
the first time I sold my body, I bought this, my treasure.
she betrayed us.
she's not liKe that.
what is she liKe?
well, she's...
someone's there.
that's a long piss!
you scared me!
we're too busy to fucK your wife today.

don't come any closer!
No!
I'll shoot!
stay bacK!
go away!
help me! Somebody, help me! Where is Kaji.
is Kaji there?
who's this?
get over here! They're splitting with the jewels.
where are you now?
toilet again? Loose bladder?
I've got a stomach ache.
these are yours. Everyone agreed.
you're one of us now.
or else I get them!
is the music finished?
enough dancing. I'm tired.
it feels so cold.
long time since I've been this hot.
Yeah, it is really cool.
I did it for money, but I've decided not to sell.
me neither.
I'll Keep them forever.
you're all rich. I envy you.
I'll build a house with it. I'll live there forever. I'll be rich!
how about you?
pigeons.
listen, footsteps.
do you worK here?
sorry we broKe in.
sell me the cat's eye.
who are you?
there's a 4. 98 million yen cat's eye ring, right?
I want to buy it.
we don't have it.
they didn't have it.
who are "they"?
we don't have it. This is all we've got.
this one? It says 300 thousand yen.
that's not it.
so that's what you looK liKe.
you were very good!
off the table bitches. come over here!
you, too. - You'll die!
get over there.
there's a bag missing. - That's all.
the one you had.
I said that's all!
okay, that's it. Go join them.
Thanks. You're finished.
Where's the other bag?
where are you going?
I'm not liKe the rest of you.
I've worKed too hard.
I'm on probation. I have a criminal record.
if I get arrested, I'll go to prison for a long time.
so what? So fucKing what?
what's this?
there's half missing.
that's all.
let's go. - No, let's Kill them first.
No! -He Killed three of us.
no way he'll live.
stop. Do you plan to leave me here?
you get on my nerves.
that's enough.
you're all very lucKy.
don't move from here.
wait up, little boy.
leaving for the West coast without me?
you little pricK! You've sucKed my breasts liKe a little baby.
you Know what'll happen when the YaKuza get you?
they'll cut you up and dump you at sea or in the mountains.
don't you understand? Stupid bitch!
look out!
forgive me.
get away from here. They'll be bacK.
what about Sayuri?
they'll cut her up.
hide her somewhere and come bacK later. OKay?
let me help.
you're obliged to.
C'mon, hurry.
he betrayed me. No-one's cutting me up!
sorry, I couldn't find it.
I want you to have it.
I'll surely get it. Then I'll give it to you.
be patient.
I Knew you'd agree. ThanKs.
okay, let it down.
ready?
okay, down she goes.
rest in peace.
one more. It's a helluva job!
where did you go earlier?
sorry, I just went out.
you were told to bring a gun! - I'm sorry.
you been poKing some bimbo with it?
which one's Kaji?
I'm told you were on TV.
I'm sorry?
a billion yen robbery, huh?
your mug shot was all over the TV.
don't bother me with details. It sobers me up.
sorry.
find the jewels and then dispose them.
I put Yoichi on to that.
I told you to do it!
sorry, I will.
are you OK?
just wait.
C'mon, give us a hand.
have you got her?
take your shoes off. Put them in the box.
damn it hurts! just dump me at sea!
watch your mouth!
you're no doctor!
you said no ambulances.
I'd much rather be at the beach.
well, we've got a pool here.
show me your wound.
how is she?
I'm no doctor. I'll give her a pill and call an ambulance.
no, don't!
leave me alone!
she's as stubborn as a child!
stop!
cut it out!
stop right there.
you'll open the wound and start bleeding again.
do you want to die?
okay, that's enough.
sure, you're bound to be scared.
no one's going to get rid of me.
I've got a score to settle with Kaji, first.
thank you.
you Know, you remind me of myself.
drink this and then let's all get some sleep.
then what?
we can't stay here. I've just been fired.
sorry to drag you into this.
I'm sorry for Sayuri, but for a while, it was fun.
leave when you really want to.
maybe see you around.
can I have one?
to Sayuri.
the swordsman tooK Kaji's portable phone.
get the number and call him.
they rescued NaoKo. She'll want revenge on you.
when that gang splits, you won't Know where to looK.
no names, addresses, nothing!
so just leave them be.
don't play dumb! Be a man!
don't... don't blame it on Kaji...
bastard!
that was close! These vests really do worK.
just piss on the floor.
hold me.
now?
I want sex.
you sure do liKe it. Even now?
okay, but Keep it quiet. No noise.
Yes. A number, please.
Yes, Run's Fitness club...
here he comes.
okay. ThanK you.
C'mon bitch, move!
inside. You better tell everything you Know.
where are you?
Where's the bitch?
she's gone!
he's dead.
what's up? Did she confess?
she shot him and escaped.
what?
Where's the girl?
trying to shift the blame, are you?
you fucKer!
you can't do anything right. You're fucKing useless.
just Keep them here.
I'll see what the Don says.
stop right there, Bro!
what the hell...? They were going to Kill us anyway.
use your head!
what do we do with them?
forget the jewelry! They Killed him. That's what's happened here.
if you find the swordsman who Killed the Boss, you'll be boss.
but before we Kill them...
I Know how to find him.
untie us first.
shoot the bitch.
he's got Kaji's phone.
call and checK.
two birds with one stone. You babes are angels.
who's calling you now? Answer it!
it's your phone, right?
I don't have one.
what?
he's here.
you? You did all this?
you asshole!
quick!
there's a stairway over here.
hurry. Damn! There's no way out.
he's too heavy.
is this club an exclusive YaKuza hang-out?
the gangs tooK it over.
who is this guy who Keeps saving us?
he came to the jewelers.
his wife wanted that cat's eye. But he didn't have the money.
so he bought earrings for her birthday.
and...?
I Killed the YaKuza who raped my wife.
I tooK their money to buy the ring.
but...
maybe it fell out during the robbery.
here.
you bitch!
this is all your fault, you greedy bitch!
no way!
she forgave you when you betrayed us. Let her be!
we're even. You can die here, I won't!
there she is!
don't!
shoot when they surface.
go bacK and apologize.
no way! They'll only Kill me!
what the hell!
excuse us...
what's that smell?
is it a dummy?
no, human.
she's dead!
the earring!
what?
I Know her.
the cat's eye... It's his wife!
what's she doing here?
her necK...
too shocKed to speaK?
I have reaped what I've sown.
he said the gang raped her.
so she Killed herself.
he brought her along...
...while he gets revenge.
that's love.
listen, I bet it starts raining within the hour.
I was thinKing the same thing.
if we go bacK, we're dead.
there's always the sea to jump into.
I don't Know why but I just had to have it.
my taste changes with men.
I played golf and went hunting as he wanted.
I needed strength. To be what I really am.
you don't want to hear this.
are you in there?
your lucK is holding out.
but not when the Boss gets here!
time to say your prayers!
she must be a good wife.
I've always wanted a man liKe you.
listen. Don't worry about me.
get out and call the police.
but how?
stop! Are you fucKing blind?
this road's closed!
how does it worK?
press both at the same time.
one, two...
Hey, get down!
do as I fucKing tell you!
stay bacK!
mine's jammed! Shoot him!
call Run!
what's the number?
come to the roof!
he's coming.
why did you come bacK?
we found his wife's dead body. She hung herself.
he didn't come for the jewelry.
your wife. She was missing you.
but why...?
you must be crazy to come bacK.
your wife Knows why.
feel better? Then, let's get out of here!
run, now!
what should we do?
you two get out of here.
slx MONTHS LATER - Where's the car? - Over there.
watch it! -Sorry, darling.
here you are. -Thank you.
mind if I join you?
I'll have the same.
I should introduce myself. My name is Gandalf.
Gandalf the Grey.
I know who you are.
well, now, this is a fine chance.
what brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?
I receive words that my father have been seen wandering in the wilds near Dunland.
I went looking, found no sign of him.
Thorin, it's been a long time since anything but rumor was heard of Thrain.
he still lives, I am sure of it.
my father came to see you before he went missing.
what did you say to him?
I urged him to march upon Erebor.
to gather the seven armies of dwarves.
to destroy the dragon and take back the Lonely Mountain.
and I would say the same to you, take back your homeland.
this is no chance meeting, is it, Gandalf?
no.
it is not.
the Lonely Mountain troubles me, Thorin.
that dragon has sat there long enough.
sooner or later, darker minds will turn towards Erebor.
I ran into some unsavory characters whilst travelling along Greenway.
they mistook me for a vagabond.
I imagine they regretted that.
one of them was carrying a message.
it is Black Speech.
he promised as payment. -For what?
your head.
someone wants you dead.
Thorin, you could wait no longer, you are the heir to the throne of Durin.
unite the armies of the Dwarves.
together you have the might and power to retake Erebor.
summon a meeting of the seven Dwarf families, demand they stand by their oath.
the Seven Armies sworn an oath to the one who wields the King's Jewel, the Arkenstone.
it is the only thing that will unite them, and in case you have forgotten, that jewel was stolen by Smaug.
what if I were to help you reclaim it?
how? The Arkenstone lies half a world away, buried beneath the feet of a fire-breathing dragon.
Yes.
which is why we're going to need a burglar.
how close is the pack? -Too close.
couple of leagues, no more.
but that's not the worst of it.
they will smell us, pick our scent.
not yet but they will do.
we have another problem.
did they see you?
they saw you? -No. That's not it.
what did I tell you? Quiet as a mouse.
excellent burglar material.
would you listen? Will you just listen?
I'm trying to tell you there is something else out there.
what form did it take, like a bear?
Yes, but bigger, much bigger.
you knew about this beast?
I say we double back.
we will be run down by a pack of wolves.
there is a house, it's not far from here, where we might take refuge.
whose house?
a friend or foe? -Neither.
he will help us, or, he will kill us.
what choice do we have?
none.
this way, quickly!
move!
come on.
in the house!
run!
come on, get inside.
open the door!
quickly.
push!
come on!
what is that?
that is our host.
his name is Beorn.
and he's a skin-changer.
sometimes he's a huge black bear, sometimes he's a great strong man.
the bear is unpredictable, but the man can be reasoned with.
however, he's not over fond of Dwarves.
he's leaving. -Come away from there!
it's not natural, none of it!
it's obvious, he's under some dark spell.
don't be a fool. He's under no enchantment but his own.
all right, now. Get some sleep, all of you.
you'll be safe here tonight.
I hope.
ash nazg durbatuluk

Agh burzum-ishi krimpatul
so you are the one they call Oakenshield.
tell me, why is Azorg the Defiler hunting you?
you know of Azorg. How?
my people were the first to live in the mountains.
before the Orcs came down from the north.
the Defiler killed most of my family.
but some he enslaved.
not for work, you understand?
but for sport.
caging skin-changers and torturing them seemed to amuse him.
there are others like you?
once there were many.
and now?
now there's only one.
you need to reach the mountain before the last days of autumn.
before Durin's Day falls, yes.
you're running out of time.
which is why we must go through Mirkwood.
a darkness lies upon that forest.
foul things creep beneath those trees.
there is an alliance between the Orcs of Moria and the Necromancer in Dol Guldur.
I would not venture there, except in great need.
we will take the Elven road. That path is too safe.
safe?
the Wood-elves in Mirkwood are not like their kin.
they're less wise and more dangerous.
but it matters not.
what do you mean?
these lands are crawling with Orcs.
their numbers are growing.
and you're on foot, you will never reach the forest alive.
I don't like Dwarves.
they are greedy, and blind.
blind to the lives of those they deem lesser than their own.
but Orcs I hate more.
what do you need?
go now, while you have the light.
your hunters are not far behind.
the Elven Gate.
here lies our path through Mirkwood.
no sign of the Orcs. We have luck on our side.
set the ponies loose. Let them return to their master.
this forest feels...
sick.
as if there's a disease lies upon it.
is there no way around?
not unless we go to 200 miles north, or twice that distance...south.
something moves in the shadows unseen, hidden from our sight.
every day it grows in strength.
beware the Necromancer.
he's not what he seems.
if our enemy has returned, we must know.
go to the tombs in the mountains.
the High Fells.
so be it.
not my horse, I need it.
you're not leaving us?
I will not do this unless I had to.
you've changed. Bilbo Baggins.
and not the same Hobbit as the one who left Shire.
I was going to tell you...
I found something in the Goblin Tunnels.
found what?
what did you find?
my courage.
good. Well that's good.
you need it.
I'll be waiting for you at the overlook before the slopes of Erebor.
keep the map and key safe.
do not enter the Mountain without me.
this is not the Greenwood.
although the very air of the forest is heavy with illusion that'll see to enter your mind...
and lead you astray.
lead us astray?
what does that mean?
you must stay on the path, do not leave it.
if you do, you'll never find it again.
no matter what may come, stay on the path!
come on, we must reach the mountain before the sunset on Durin's Day.
Durin's Day?
let's go. -We have one chance to find the hidden door .
the path goes this way.
this way.
air. I need air.
my head, it's spinning. What's happening?
we're moving. -Nori.
why have we stopped?
the path, it's disappeared.
what's going on?
we've lost the path.
find it. All of you, look! Look for the path!
I don't remember this place, none of it is familiar.
where is it?
we do not know. We do not even know what it is.
look, a tobacco pouch.
there's Dwarves in these woods.
dwarves in the Blue Mountains no less.
this is exactly the same as mine.
because it is yours.
you understand? We are going round in circles, we are lost.
we're not lost, we keep heading east.
but which way is the east?
we've lost the sun.
the sun, we have to find the sun.
up there.
what's that?
enough! Quiet, all of you!
we're being watched.
I, I can see a lake.
and a river, and the Lonely Mountain.
we're almost there.
can you hear me?
I know which way to go.
Hello?
hello.
no, come on!
eat them now, none is running.
his hide is tough, this could be juicy inside.
finish it.
he's alive, you didn't kill him.
kill him now!
feast!
feast!
what is it?
fair terms, you see.
just a little taste.
where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
here.
it stings, stings!
sting?
it's a good name.
sting.
I'm all right. -Where's Bilbo?
Bilbo. -I'm up here.
haul!
where is it? Where is it? Where is it?
No!
Gloin! Kili!
kill them all!
Kili!
mine.
come on, keep up!
do not think I will not kill you, Dwarf.
it would be my pleasure.
No! -Kili!
throw me your dagger!
quick!
did you think I'm giving you a weapon, Dwarf?
you're mistaken!
search them.
Hey, give it back, that's private!
who is this? Your brother?
that is my wife!
and what is this horrid creature, a Goblin-mutant?
that's my wee lad, Gimli!
where did you get this?
it was given to me.
not just a thief but a liar as well.
Enwenno hain!
Thorin, where's Bilbo?
this is not the end of it!
aren't you going to search me?
I could have anything down my trousers.
or nothing.
leave it!
there is no way out, this is no Orc dungeon.
these are holes of the Woodland Realm.
no one leaves here but by the King's consent.
some imagine that a noble quest is at hand.
a quest to reclaim a homeland, and slay a dragon.
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.
attempted burglary or something of that ilk.
you have found a way in.
you seek that which would bestow upon you, the right to rule.
the King's Jewel.
the Arkenstone.
it is precious to you beyond measure.
I understand that.
the gems in the Mountain that I, too, desire...
white gems, a pure starlight.
I offer you my help.
I'm listening.
I would let you go, if you but return what is mine.
a favor for a favor.
have my word, one king to another.
I would not trust Thranduil, a great king to honor his words till the end of all days be upon us.
you lack all honor!
I've seen how you treat your friends.
we came to you once, starving, homeless , seeking your help.
but you turned your back.
you turned away from the suffering of my people.
the inferno that destroyed us.
Imrid amrad ursul!
do not talk to me of dragon fire.
I know its wrath and ruin.
I have faced the great serpents of the north.
I warned your grandfather of what his greed would summon.
but he would not listen.
you are just like him.
stay here if you will, and rot.
100 years is a mere blink in the life of an Elf.
I am patient. I can wait.
did he offer you a deal? -He did.
him and all his kin!
that's that, then.
the deal was our only hope.
not our only hope.
I know you're there.
why do you linger in the shadows?
I was coming to report to you.
I thought I ordered that nest to be destroyed not 2 moons past.
we cleared the forest as ordered, my lord.
but more spiders keep coming up from the south.
they are spawning in the ruins of Dol Guldur.
if we could kill them at their source...
the fortress lies beyond our borders.
keep our lands clear of those foul creatures.
that is your task.
and when we drive them off? What then?
will they not spread to other lands?
other lands are not my concern.
fortunes of the world will rise and fall.
but here in this kingdom, we will endure.
legolas said you fought well today.
he's grown very fond of you.
I assure you, my lord.
legolas thinks of me as no more than a captain of the guard.
perhaps he did once.
now I'm not so sure.
I do not think you would allow your son to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.
no, you're right. I would not.
still, he cares about you.
do not give him hope where there is none.
the stone in your hand, what is it?
it is a talisman.
a powerful spell lies upon it, if any but a Dwarf reads the runes on this stone...
they will be forever cursed.
or not.
depending on whether you believe.
this kind of thing is just a token.
a rune stone.
my mother gave it to me so I'd remember my promise.
what promise?
that I would come back to her.
she worries.
she thinks I'm reckless.
are you?
sounds like quite a party having out there.
it is mereth en gilith.
the feast of starlight.
all light is sacred to the Eldar.
but Wood Elves love best for light of the stars.
I always thought it is a cold light.
remote and far away.
it is memory.
precious and pure.
like your promise.
I have walked there sometimes.
beyond the forest and up into the night.
I have seen the world full away.
and the white light forever fill the air.
I saw fire moon once.
the roads of the path near Dunland.
huge, red and golden it was, filled the sky.
we were an escort for some merchants in Mindolluin, they were trading in silver work for furs.
we took the Greenway south.
keeping the mountain to our left.
at the end of the day, you see huge fire moon lighting our path.
we're running out of drink.
these empty barrels should be sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.
bargeman would be waiting for them.
say what you like, but the ill-tempered king has this excellent, tasty wine.
come on, Ross, try it. -I have the Dwarves in my charge.
they're locked up, where can they go?
I'll wager the sun is on the rise. Must be nearly dawn.
we never gonna reach the mountain, are we?
not stuck in here, you know?
Bilbo.
there are guards nearby.
what's this?
you first.
Ori. -Not that way. Down here, follow me!
this way.
come. -I don't believe we're in the cellars!
you're supposed to be leading us out now for the road!
I know what I'm doing.
this way.
everyone, climb into the barrels, quickly!
are you mad? They'll find us.
no, no, they won't. I promise you!
please, please, you must trust me!
do as he says.
what do we do now?
hold your breath.
hold my breath? What do you mean?
where is the keeper of the keys?
welcome, Master Baggins.
come on, let's go.
hold on!
Bilbo!
hang on.
no. Help!
No!
watch out!
get on to the bridge!
Kili?
Kili?
Kili?
nori!
come along!
Bombur!
Oh, it's you.
why am I here, Gandalf?
trust me, Radagast.
I would not have called you here without a good reason.
this is not a nice place to meet.
no. It is not.
these are dark spells, Gandalf.
old, and full of hate.
who's buried here?
if he had name, it's long since been lost.
he would have been known only as a servant of evil.
one of nine.
why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.
the Ring-wraiths is summoned to Dol Guldur.
but it can not be the Necromancer.
a human sorcerer could not summon such evil.
who said it was human?
the Nine only answer to one master.
we've been blind, Radagast.
and in our blindness the enemy has returned.
he's summoning his servants.
Azorg the Defiler is no ordinary hunter.
he's a commander, a commander of legions.
the enemy is preparing for war.
it will begin in the east. His mind is set upon that mountain.
where are you going?
to rejoin the others. -Gandalf.
I started this, I can not forsake them.
they are in grave danger.
if what you say is true...
the world is in grave danger.
the power in that fortress will only grow stronger.
you want me to cast my friends aside.
anything behind us? -Not that I can see.
I think we've outrun the Orcs.
not for long.
we've lost the current.
make for the shore. Come on, let's go.
come on.
I'm fine. It's nothing.
on your feet. -Kili's wounded, his leg needs binding.
there's an Orc pack on our tail. We keep moving.
to where? -To the mountain, we're so close.
a lake lies between us and that mountain.
we have no way to cross it.
so then we go around. -The Orcs'll run us down, as sure as daylight.
we have no weapon to defend ourselves.
bind his legs quickly. You have 2 minutes.
do it again...and you're dead.
excuse me, but, um...you're from Lake-town, if I'm not mistaken?
that barge over there, is it available for hire by any chance?
what makes you think I would help you?
those boots have seen better days.
as has that coat.
no doubt you have some hungry mouths to feed.
how many bearings?
a boy and two girls.
and your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.
aye, she was.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
come on, come on. Enough for the niceties!
what's your hurry?
what's it to you?
I would like to know who you are.
and what you are doing in these lands.
we are simple merchants from the Blue Mountains.
journeying to see our kin in the Iron Hills.
simple merchants you say.
we need food, supplies, weapons.
can you help us?
I know where these barrels came from.
what of it?
I don't know what business you had with the Elves.
but I don't think it ended well.
no one enters Lake-town but by lead of The Master.
all his wealth comes from trades with the Woodland Realm.
he would see you in irons before risking the wraith of king Thranduil.
I'll wager there are ways to enter that town unseen.
Aye.
but for that, you would need a smuggler.
for which we will pay, double.
such is the nature of evil.
out there in the vast ignorance of the world it festers and spreads.
a shadow that grows in the dark.
a sleepless malice as black as the oncoming wall of night.
so it ever was. So will it always be.
in time, all foul things come forth.
you were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.
Why?
not 13.
not any more.
the young one, the black-haired archer.
we stuck him of a Morgul shaft.
poison is in his blood, he'll be choking on it soon.
answer the question, filth.
I would not antagonize her.
you like killing things, Orc?
you like death?
then let me give it to you!
I do not care about one dead Dwarf. Answer the question.
you have nothing to fear.
tell us what you know and I will set you free.
you had orders to kill them, Why?
what is Thorin Oakenshield to you?
the Dwarf runt will never be king.
king? There's no King Under the Mountain.
nor will there ever be. None would they enter Erebor whilst the dragon lives.
you know nothing.
your world will burn.
what are you talking about?
speak!
our time has come again.
my master serves the One.
do you understand now, Elfling? Death is upon you.
the flames of war are upon you.
why did you do that?
you promised to set him free.
and I did.
I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.
there was more the Orc could tell us.
there was nothing more he could tell me.
what did he mean by the flames of war?
it means they intend to unleash a weapon so great it will destroy all before it.
I want the watch doubled at our borders, all roads, all rivers.
nothing moves that I hear of it.
no one enters this kingdom, and no one leaves it.
watch out!
what are you trying to do? Drown us?
I was born and bred on these waters , master Dwarf.
if I wanted to drown you, I would not do it here.
Oh, I've had enough of this slippy lake-man.
I say we throw him over the sail and then we dump him.
bard, his name is Bard.
how do you know?
um, I asked him.
I don't care what he calls himself, I don't like him.
we do not have to like him. We simply have to pay him.
come now lads, turn out your pockets.
how do we know he won't betray us?
we don't.
there's um, still a big problem.
we're 10 coins short.
Gloin, come on. Give us what you have.
don't look to me.
I've been bled dry by this venture.
what have I seen from my investment?
naught but misery and grief and...
bless my beard.
take it, take all of it.
the money, quick, give it to me.
we will pay you when we get our provisions, but not before.
if you value your freedom, you'll do as I say.
there are guards ahead.
what's he doing?
he's talking to someone.
he's pointing right at us.
now they're shaking hands.
what?
the villain!
he's selling us out.
quiet!
we're approaching the tollgate.
halt. Goods inspection. Papers, please.
Oh, it's you, Bard.
morning, Percy.
anything to declare?
nothing, that I am cold and tired, and ready for home.
you and me both.
here we are, all in order.
not so fast.
consignment of empty barrels from the Woodland Realm.
only, they are not empty, are they, Bard?
if I recall correctly. Your licensed as a bargeman.
not a fisherman.
that's none of your business!
wrong. It's the Master's business, which makes it my business.
Oh, come on, Alfred, Have a heart. People need to eat!
these fish are illegal.
empty the barrels over the side. -You heard him.
in the canal.
come on.
folks in this town are struggling.
times are hard, food is scarce.
that's not my problem.
and when the people hear their Master's dumping the fish in the lake, when the rioting starts,
will it be your problem, then?
stop!
ever the people's champion, aye, Bard? Protector of the common folk.
you might have their favor now, bargeman. But it won't last.
raise the gate.
the Master has his eye on you, you do well to remember.
we know where you live.
it's a small town, Alfred. Everyone knows where everyone lives.
all these talks of civil are unrest.
someone's been stirring the pot, Sire.
gout playing ox, Sire?
it's the damp, it's the only possible explanation. Get me a brandy.
the mood of the people, sire, is turning ugly.
they're commoners, Alfred. They've always been ugly.
it's not my fault that they live in a place that stinks of fish oil and tar.
jobs, shelter, food, that's all they ever plead about.
it is my belief, sire, that they've been led on by trouble makers.
then we must find these trouble makers, and arrest them.
my thoughts exactly, sire.
and all these talks of change must be suppressed.
what a fault to let the rebel banded together and start making noises.
the next thing you know, they'll start asking questions, forming commities...
launching inquiries.
out with the old, in with the new.
what?
that's what I've been saying, sire.
there's even talk of election.
election? It's absurd. I won't stand for it.
I don't think they'll ask you to stand, sire.
Sackers, ingrates, rebel-rousers.
who would have the nerve to question my authority!
who would dare? Who...
bard.
you mark my words, that trouble-making bargeman is behind all this.
get your hands off me.
you didn't see them. They were never here.
fish you can have for nothing.
follow me.
da, our house, it's being watched.
you can tell the Master I'm done for the day.
da.
where have you been?
father, there you are! I was worried.
Yes. Bain, get them in.
if you speak of this to anyone. I'll rip your arms off.
off.
out there.
da, why are the Dwarves climbing out from our toilet?
will they bring us luck?
they may not be the best fit, but they'll keep you warm.
thank you.
the Dwarvish Windlass.
you look like you've seen a ghost.
Yes. The last time we saw such a weapon, a city was on fire.
it was the day the dragon came.
the day that Smaug destroyed Dale.
Girion, the Lord of the city.
rallied his bowman to fire upon the beast.
but a dragon's hide is tough. Tougher than the strongest armor.
only a black arrow fired from a Windlass would pierce the dragon hide.
and few of those arrows were ever made.
the store was running low when Girion made his last stand.
had the aim of men been true that day...
much would've been different.
you speak as if you were there?
all Dwarves know the tale.
and you would know that Girion hit the dragon?
it loosened the scale on the left wing one more shot he would have killed the beast.
that's fairy story, lad. Nothing more.
you took all our money.
where are the weapons?
wait here.
tomorrow begins our last day of autumn.
Durin's day falls the morning after next.
we must reach the mountain before then.
and if we do not?
if we fail to find the hidden door before that time?
then this quest has been for nothing.
what is this?
pike hook.
made from an old harpoon.
and this?
a crowbill, we call it. Expansion from smittys hammer.
it's heavy in hand, I grant.
but in defense of your life, these will serve you better than none.
we paid you for weapons.
iron forged, swords of dark sheath.
it's a joke.
you won't find better outside the city armory.
all iron-forged weapons are held there and locked in key.
Thorin.
why not take his offer and go?
I've made do with less. So have you.
I say we leave now.
you're not going anywhere.
what did you see?
there are spies watching this house and probably every wolf and dog in town.
you must wait until nightfall.
Thorin.
da?
don't let them leave.
you can not hunt 30 orcs on your own.
but I'm not on my own.
you knew I would come?
the king is angry, Tauriel.
for 600 years, my father has protected you, favored you.
you defied his orders.
you betrayed his trust.
the king has never let Orcs fill from outlands.
but he would let this Orc pack cross our borders and kill our prisoners.
it is not our fight. -It is our fight.
it will not end here. With every victory this evil will grow.
if your father has his way, we would do nothing.
we will hide within our walls, live our lives away from light.
and let the darkness descend.
are we not a part of this world?
tell me melon, when did we let evil become stronger than us?
Hello, Bard. What you after?
there was a tapestry, an old one. Where has it gone?
what tapestry are you talking about?
this one.
they were Dwarves, I tell you. Appeared out of nowhere.
Full-beards, pierced eyes. I've never seen the like.
what are Dwarves doing in these parts?
it's the prophecy.
prophecy? -Prophecy of Durin's folk.
prophecy?
prophecy.
the old tales may come true.
vast hordes of treasure?
can it really be true?
has the Lord of the silver fountains returned?
the lord of the silver fountains. The king of carven stone.
the King Beneath the Mountain.
shall come into his own.
and the bell shall ring in gladness at the Mountain King's return.
but all shall fail in sadness, and the lake will shine and burn.
da, I tried to stopped them... -How long have they been gone?
as soon we have the weapons we make straight for the Mountain.
go, go, go.
you all right?
I can manage.
let's just get out of here.
run!
what is the meaning of this?
we caught them stealing weapon, sire.
enemies of the state, em?
a disgrace bunch of mercenaries, if ever there were, Sire.
hold your tongue!
you do not know to whom you speak.
this is no common criminal! This is Thorin, son of Thrain, son of Thror!
we are the Dwarves of Erebor.
we have come to reclaim our homeland.
I remember this town in the great days of old.
fleets of boats laid at the harbor, filled with silks and fine gems.
this was no forsaken town on a lake.
this was the center of all trade of the North.
I would see those days return,
I would relive the great forges of Dwarves, send wealth and riches flowing once more from the hordes of Erebor!
death, that is what you will bring upon us.
dragon fire and ruin.
if you awaken that beast, it will destroy us all.
you can listen to this nay-sayer, but I promise you this:
if we succeed, all will share in the wealth of the Mountain.
you will have enough gold, to rebuild Esgaroth 10 times over.
all of you, listen to me! You must listen!
have you forgotten what happened in Dale?
have you forgotten of those who died in firestorm?
and for what purpose?
the blind ambition of a Mountain King.
so riven by greed, he can not see beyond his own desire!
no, no. We must not, any of us, be too quick to lay blame.
let us not forget, that it was Girion,
lord of Dale, your ancestor, who failed to kill the beast.
it's true, sire. We all know the story.
arrow after arrow he shot, each one missing its mark.
you have no right, no right to enter that mountain.
I have the only right.
I speak to the Master of the men of the lake.
will you see the prophecy fulfilled?
will you...share in the great wealth of our people?
what say you?
I say unto you, welcome!
welcome and rise! Welcome, King under the mountain!
you do know we have one short?
Where's Bifur? -He's not here, we leave him behind.
you'll have to, if you were to find the door before nightfall.
we can risk no more delays.
not you.
we must travel with speed. You'll slow us down.
what are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
no.
uncle, I must be there when that door is open.
when we first look upon the halls of our fathers, Thorin...
Kili, stay here, rest, join us when you're healed.
I'll stay with the lad my duty lies with the wounded.
uncle.
we grew up with the tales of the Mountain, tales you told us.
you can't take that away from him.
Kili. - I will carry him if I must!
one day you will be king and you will understand.
I cannot risk the fate of this quest for the sake of one Dwarf.
not even my own kin.
Fili, don't be a fool. You belong with the company.
I belong with my brother.
by my beard, is that the time!
good fortune to all!
move.
no.
did you miss the boarders as well?
Kili, Kili!
no. I'm done with Dwarves, go away.
no, no, no. No one will help us.
Kili's sick.
he's very sick.
what is this place?
for once the city of Dale. Now it is a ruin.
the desolation of Smaug.
the sun will soon reach midday.
we must find the hidden door into the Mountain before it sets.
this way. -Wait.
is this the overlook?
Gandalf said to meet him here on no account of what you hear or...
do you see him? We have no time to wait upon a wizard.
we're on our own.
come.
dol Guldur, the hill of sorcerer.
it looks completely abandoned.
as it is meant to.
a spell of concealment lies over this place.
which means our enemies are not yet ready to reveal himself.
he has not regained his full strength.
Radagast, I need you to carry a message to the Lady Galadriel.
tell her, we must force his hand.
what do you mean?
I'm going in alone. On no account come after me.
do I have your word? -Yes, yes, yes.
wait, Gandalf.
what if it's a trap?
turn around and do not come back.
it's undoubtly a trap.
ce no ulco sis nurtaina...
I ettuluvas caninye!
anything? -Nothing!
if the map is true, the hidden door is hidden right above us.
up here!
you have keen eyes, Master Baggins.
this must be it.
the hidden door.
that all those who doubted us, rue this day!
aye, we have a key.
this means that somewhere, there is a keyhole.
the last light of Durin's Day...
will shine upon the keyhole.
we're losing the light, come on.
be quiet! We can't hear when you're thumping!
can't find it.
it's not here!
here!
wreck it down!
come on.
it has to break.
it's no good, the door is sealed.
can't be opened by force.
there is powerful magic on it.
no.
the last light of Durin's Day...
will shine upon the keyhole.
that what it says.
what did we miss?
what did we miss?
Balin. -We've lost the light.
there's no more to be done.
we have but one chance.
come over here, lads. It's over.
wait a minute, what...
where are they going?
you can't give up now.
fine.
you can't give up now.
last light, the grey stone.
when the thrush nods.
the setting sun.
and the last light of Durin's Day will shine...
the last light.
last light.
and the last light...
the keyhole! Come back!
come back! It's the moon! The last moon of autumn!
Where's the key, where's the key? Where's the...
it was...here. It was here.
it was just...
Erebor.
Thorin.
I know these walls.
these walls...
the stone...
you remember, Balin?
chambers filled with golden light.
I remember.
herein lies the seventh kingdom of Durin's folk.
may the Heart of the Mountain unite all Dwarves in defense of this home.
the throne of the king.
and what's that above it?
the Arkenstone.
Arkenstone.
and what's that? -That, master burglar...
is why you are here.
can you not do something? -I need herbs.
something to bring down this fever.
I have nightshade, fever fuel.
they're no use to me. Do you have any king's foil?
no, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.
pigs? Weed, right.
don't move.
do you want me to find the jewel?
a large white jewel, yes.
that's it? Only I imagine there's quite a few down there.
there is only one Arkenstone.
you'll know it when you see it.
right.
in truth, lad. I do not know what you'll find down there.
you needn't go if you don't want to.
there's no dishonor in turning back. -No, Balin.
I promised I would do this.
and I think I must try.
you never ceases to amaze me.
what's that? -The courage of Hobbits.
go now, with as much luck as you can muster.
Oh...Bilbo?
if there's in fact a, um...
a live dragon down here?
don't wake it.
ce no ulco sis nurtaina...
I ettuluvas caninye! Conin i so tanuvaxe!
where is your master?
where is he?
Sauron!
Hello?
you're not at home. Not at home.
what if...good, good, good.
what's that?
Arkenstone, Arkenstone.
a large white jewel.
very helpful.
well, thief.
I smell you.
I hear your breath.
I feel your air.
where are you?
where are you?
come now, don't be shy.
stand into the light.
there is something about you.
something you carry.
something made of gold.
but far more precious.
there you are, a thief in the shadows.
I did not come to steal from you.
o Smaug, the unassessably wealthy.
I merely want to get eyes upon your magnificence.
to see if you really were as great as the old tales say.
I did not believe them!
and do you now?
truly.
the tales and songs...
fall utterly short, of your enormity, O Smaug the stupendous!
do you think flattery will keep you alive?
no, no...
no indeed.
you seem familiar with my name.
but I don't remember smelling your kind before.
who are you? And where do you come from...
may I ask?
I...
I came from under the hill.
under hill?
and under hills and over hills, my path is lead.
and, and through the air. I am here that He walks unseen.
impressive, what else do you claim to be?
I am...Luck-wearer...
Riddle-maker. -Lovely titles, go on.
Barrel-rider. -Barrels.
now that is interesting.
and what about your little Dwarf friends?
where are they hiding?
D...dwarves? No...
no, no Dwarves here. You got that all wrong.
I don't think so.
Barrel-rider, they sent you in here to do their dirty work, while they skulk about outside.
truly. You are mistaken...
o Smaug, chiefest and greatest of all calamities.
you have nice manners for a thief and a liar.
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.
no one better.
it is the gold.
they are drawn to treasure like flies to dead flesh.
did you think I did not know this day would come?
that a pack of canting dogs will come crawling back to the Mountain.
was that an earthquake? -That, my lad...
was a dragon.
da? -It's come from the mountain.
you should leave us. Take your children, get out of here.
and go where? There is nowhere to go.
are we going to die, da? -No, darling.
the dragon is going to kill us.
not if I kill it first.
the King Under the Mountain is dead. I took his throne.
I ate his people like a wolf among sheep.
I kill where I wish, when I wish.
my armor is iron!
no blade can pierce me!
all right. -A black arrow. Why did you never tell me?
because you did not need to know.
listen to me carefully. I need you to distract the guards.
once I'm at the top of the tower, I will set the arrow to the bow.
there he is. -Guards, after him!
quickly, down there! Go!
stop him!
bain, Bain.
keep it safe, don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them. Now go! -I'm not leaving.
Ragar. -You're under arrest.
on what charge? -Any charge the Master chooses.
what about Bilbo? -Give him more time.
time to do what? To be killed?
you're afraid. -Yes, I'm afraid.
I fear for you, the sickness the lies upon that treasure, a sickness which drove your grandfather mad.
I'm not my grandfather.
you're not yourself.
the Thorin I know would not hesitate to go in there.
I will not risk this quest for the life of one burglar.
Bilbo, his name is Bilbo.
it's Oakenshield, that filthy Dwarvish usurper!
he sent you here for the Arkenstone, didn't he?
no, no, no...
I don't know what you're talking about.
don't bother denying it,
I guessed his foul purpose some time ago.
but it matters not.
Oakenshield's quest will fail.
a darkness is coming.
it was spread to every corner of the land.
you are being used, thief in the shadows.
you are only ever a means to an end.
the coward Oakenshield has weighed the value of your life, and found it worth nothing.
no.
no, you're lying.
what did he promise you, a share of the treasure?
as if it was his to give.
I will not part with a single coin!
not one piece of it.
my teeth are swords, my claws are spears.
my wings, are a hurricane.
so it is true.
the black arrow found its mark. -What did you say?
nothing. I was just saying your reputation proceeds you,
o Smaug the Tyrannical.
truly, you have no equal on this earth.
I'm almost tempted to let you take it.
if only to see Oakenshield suffer.
watch it destroy him.
watch it corrupt his arms, and drive him mad.
but I think not, I think our little game ends here.
so tell me, thief.
how do you choose to die?
da? Is that you, Da?
you killed them all.
there are others, Tauriel.
come.
we're losing him.
Tauriel.
Athelas.
Athelas.
what are you doing?
I'm going to save him.
you're alive. -Not for much longer.
did you find the Arkenstone? -The dragon's coming.
the Arkenstone.
did you find it?
we should get out.
Thorin.
Thorin.
you will burn!
come on! -Come on, Bilbo!
come on.
hold him down.
Tilda!
we have given him the slip.
no, he'll still come in for that.
so where to now? -Western guard room.
there may be a way out. -It's too high.
no chance that way. -It's our only chance.
we have to try it.
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.
Menno o nin na hon i eliad annen annin hon leitho o-ngurth.
I've heard tales of wonders of Elvish medicine.
that was a privilege to witness.
Tauriel.
lie still.
you cannot be her.
she's far away.
she is far, far away from me.
she walks in starlight in another world.
it was just a dream.
do you think she could have loved me?
stay close.
that's it, then. -There's no way out.
the last of our kin.
they must have come here, hoping beyond hope.
we can try to reach the mines.
my last few days.
no.
I will not die like this.
Cowering, clawing for breath.
we make for the forges. -He'll see us, sure as death.
not if we split up.
Thorin, we'll never make it.
some of us might, lead him to the forges.
we kill the dragon.
if this is to end in fire, then we will all burn together.
this way.
flee, flee, run for your lives.
there is nowhere to hide.
behind you!
come on!
run!
hey you! Here!
this way, it's this way!
come on! -Thorin!
follow Balin.
