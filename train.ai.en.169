spyker cars, the small dutch company which bought saab from general motors last year, announced on thursday the deal had been cancelled.
spyker is seeking fresh funding from a russian investor but, based on volvo's experience, many swedes would prefer to see a chinese white knight ride to the rescue.
spyker launched its first bid for the swedish brand last month after the collapse of talks between gm and a consortium led by sweden's koenigsegg automotive, another niche sports car maker.
spyker said it remained hopeful the rescue plan would eventually go through but, in the meantime, it was holding talks with potential chinese partners and other investors over additional funding.
spyker said on thursday production would resume once fresh financing had been secured.
spyker shopped saab widely to chinese buyers, but gm blocked a sale by announcing it would not continue its licenses to patents and technology.
spyker turned to chinese industrial investors for money.
spyker, controlled by the dutch entrepreneur victor muller, is pinning most of its hopes on a planned cash injection by vladimir antonov, a russian financier, who has agreed to buy saab's plant and other real estate and lease it back to the company.
spyker, the dutch boutique sports car maker, said the new offer would remove all the obstacles that caused its previous bid to collapse and gave gm until the end of today to consider it.
spyker, whose roots go back to 1875 as the former coach builder for the dutch royal family, is part-owned by the convers banking group, which is controlled by vladimir antonov, a russian tycoon.
