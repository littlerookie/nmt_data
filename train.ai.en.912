quiet for mommy.
the doctor's thinkinG.
dental fillings?
Yes.
she went to the dentist-- her first cavity.
dental anesthesia can react with hemoglobin in the blood.
I've never seen it before, but it happens.
but it isn't serious? She's gonna be okay?
a onetime thing like this, I'll give her an I. V.
treatment of methylene blue, she'll be nice and pink in no time.
he that should do the trick.
I gotta take a picture.
you totally do.
okay, cathleen, I'm gonna ask you some questions about your sex life, and the more you can tell me about previous partners, experiences
Oh, my god. I don't have any previous experiences.
I mean, uh, men, before geoffrey.
I'm a virgin, dr. Montgomery.
I know.
no one waits this long.
it's weird.
it's not weird.
it's just.
surprising.
I didn't want to give it up in high school to some band geek in the back of his dad's car, you know?
in college, I kept thinking, he's coming.
the one, and I wanted to wait for him.
and then I thought, I've waited this long, I should hold out.
I want it to mean something.
I wanted the fairytale.
I want it to be special and perfect.
I wanted- - the magic.
exactly.
some magic.
let's take a look. Okay?
all righty, this is gonna be a little cold.
I know it's a little uncomfortable.
just try to relax.
I am relaxed.
you've had exams before this?
Oh, god.
it's really broken.
it's broken, isn't it?
it's not the kind of thing that breaks.
okay.
we're gonna go really slow.
knocking at the door.
stopping in for a little visit, and I'm knocking.
knocking a little harder.
and I'm done knocking.
I'm gonna die a virgin.
we're gonna figure this out, cathleen.
we are going to get you your wedding night.
she's 35, and she's never- - nope.
and the gates are closed, locked, welded shut.
holding on to your virginity for that long?
I think it's sad.
it's not sad. It's sweet.
okay, not being able to have sex with your husband when you want to, that'sad.
but the waiting?
I mean, what's wrong with wanting a little magic?
I lost my virginity when I was 17.
it was not magic.
a lot of friction.
I got rug burns in bad places.
you know, I didn't get the magic until sam?
I didn't know it could be magic until sam.
I hardly rember the last time I had a little magic.
I hear that.
how can you eat that much sugar this early in the morning?
dell made it.
I'm just being polite.
you know, and what's all this magic talk anyway?
first L. A.Doesn't have it
I don't know.
the last time I was here, I just felt more.
magic-Y.
well, yeah.
you kissed pete.
I did not kiss pete.
Pete kissed me, which I did not ask for.
I don't even know if he's normal.
you know, one minute he's hot, the next minute he's arctic.
I don't need that kind of damage, no matter how fancy his lips are.
here he comes.
you're talking about sex, aren't you?
we were talking about a patient.
who can't have sex.
well, send 'em my way. I'll get 'em going.
you know, this is a very serious issue.
this is a woman who has needs, who has wants, who needs and wants magic in her life.
this is not a dirty little joke that you can make your dirty little jokes about, dirty man.
you don't know me at all.
you think you do, but you don'T.
so. don't call me names.
you should give him a pass this week.
Why?
you just.
should.
see what I mean?
a club.
a closed club.
I went back on my vow, and--and now she's bleeding?
my words did that.
no, you don't control anything except yourself.
our work together has not been about getting you to leave your wife.
it's been about getting you to say what you want.
remember the goalposts, doug.
the goalposts.
right.
so she lost some iron.
big deal.
I want a divorce.
Yes, you do.
Karen, I.
the bleeding got a lot worse.
I checked her C. B.C.
her hematocrit's less than 30.
less than 30?
are--are you sure?
you mean there's something really wrong with her?
Yes, there's something wrong with me.
you picked a great time to walk out, doug.
just great.
it's called vaginismus.
it's a condition that causes a constant involuntary muscle spasm.
so you have a way to fix it, right?
you--you can fix it?
not--not that I'm not fine the way things are.
I'm fine.
I love you, and I don't need to have sex to know that I love you.
you can fix it?
please tell me you can fix it.
well, I would like to prescribe a muscle relaxant for you, cathleen, and you'd take it about an hour before you
a pill. That's good. A-a pill.
I can do a pill.
and it'll work?
well, there have been case studies.
um, just, uh.
give it your best shot.
at--at home.
give it your best shot at home.
and she needs to do her homework and show it to you.
and she can talk on the phone, but do not let her get on the internet because you still don't have that thing that blocks the child predators.
good night, naomi.
shuffling maya back and forth, it's just not practical.
we're gonna be fine.
Maya's gonna be fine.
you and your head take the night off.
it's just that she's a girl.
mothers know more when it comes to girls.
uh, I'm--i'm shutting down for the night unless you need anything.
no, uh, but, uh, here.
uh, here's your cake carrier.
you ate the whole thing?
we.
I-I didn't.
eat a whole cake.
I mean, I c-- I wouldn't.
I-I couldn't.
it was really good.
well, I'm glad you liked it.
okay, thank you.
still raining.
Yeah.
I see that.
I made you another one last night.
I r-- I-I really shouldn't.
this time I baked chocolate chips inside.
I can't.
thank you.
you know what? Maybe someone else might want it.
so I'll just, uh.
right.
no sex.
not even a little sex.
Really?
Did--or-- really?
she took the pill. She
we tried.
Oh, sister, how we tried.
honey, it's okay.
it's not okay.
I need sex.
I need sex, geoffrey.
I have waited and waited and waited, and I want to do it.
I want to do it now.
look, I know, I'm just saying, you don't need to get upset.
we have other things to connect us.
you're a man, geoffrey, a big, strong, very hot man, which is.
I hit the jackpot with you.
and we want kids.
we want a family.
which is now not gonna happen because you're gonna leave me for someone else
I'm not gonna leave you.
I don't need sex.
we don't lie to one another.
we never have.
don't start now.
please, doctor.
nothing I've tried has worked.
I mean, she just can'T.
ju--she just can'T.
and she deserves-- he'S.
her guy, her one.
marriage without sex.
it happens all the time.
maybe it's psychological.
can you see her?
actually, pete should see her.
what? - What?
there are some very good studies about guided actualization, and that's his area.
that's my area.
want some cake?
sweet mother of chocolate.
I know.
you realize your replacing sex with food?
you want some?
they're getting happy over cake.
I mean, if I could get happy over cake.
well, I wouldn't be a man.
exactly.
secret to women.
Oh, like you know the secret to women.
you're a child.
you can barely grow facial hair.
you don't know anything about women yet.
figure out what they want and give it to them.
Yeah.
well, that's.
you baked that cake?
my grandmother baked that cake.
but naomi doesn't need to know that.
figure out what they want and give it to them.
it wasn't the fillings.
is erin okay? What happened?
I-I don't know. They just got worse.
get an exam room
you want just one?
your patient who can't have sex?
my patient. Mind your own business.
she's checking her history to see if she might be able to find anything that could be causing the vaginismus.
he asked.
he snooped.
you really don't want to try my thing?
your thing? What, to creatively visualize the parting of the red sea, a gentle opening of a flower?
you know, addison, the way we work around here is
Yeah, I know, you utilize each other. I got it.
but this is-- we take it slow.
and your solution is, what, put her in surgery?
this woman is not gonna die if she doesn't have sex.
Oh, please. If it was you going without, you'd be begging to go under the knife, my highly skilled knife.
I knew it was too much to hope for a double board certified surgeon not to be the most arrogant
arrogant? You've got a god and a buddha complex all rolled up into one big, arrogant-- I got this.
back off.
Oh, come on.
Naomi is this close to a diabetic coma thanks to your cake, so you're way worse than I am.
Dr. Turner?
stay out of my marriage.
I think you took careof that.
Doug canceled his therapy appointment this morning.
well, I want to make sure it stays that way.
and if he shows up again.
I pay the bills.
you won't see a dime.
I don't care about the dime, and even if I did.
w-why are you fighting for something that makes you both so miserable?
you have no idea how my marriage makes me feel.
you have no idea who I am.
you only have doug's side of the story.
I'm the bitch, and he's--he's.
I-I am not on anybody's
just stay away from
did you
we need some help!
pp I hear you got blue girls.
I ran labs. Nothing's turned up so far. It's driving me crazy.
I give them I. V.S, and they turn pink and seem fine and.
their mom insisted on taking them home.
you want me to take a look at 'em?
I ordered extensive blood chromatographs.
when those come back, yeah, maybe.
the mom checked the house for environmental toxins?
Yeah, I gave her the full list and she said she's gonna go over it top to bottom, which is gonna take a while and.
that's time we don't have.
you know, I'm going over there. I'm gonna give her a hand.
there's nothing here from my list of contaminants, and the girls were no place else today? No fend's houses? No
they've been here all day, with me.
this was my great plan.
I quit my job, fired the nanny because I could do it better.
you've childproofed, you buy organic, you have, uh, biodegradable dryer sheets.
I could eat them.
okay? This is not negligence.
Yeah, but.
if something happens to them, I--their dad travels all the time.
I can't call him up and say
for now we just need to find out what's doing this so that the exposure doesn't become even more dangerous.
but we've gone through the house top to bottom.
the yard, the garage
what did the girls say about it?
where were they before this happened?
they don't talk, not to me, not to anyone over 8.
mommy!
mommy, what's the matter with erin?
she's having a seizure.
she'll be okay. She'll be okay.
I got your test results.
you've got something called wegener's disease.
it's a disease of the blood vessels that affects the ears, nose, throat and kidneys.
does she.
does she die from this?
well, it takes years to progress to that stage.
with the proper treatment, we should be able to keep it at bay for a long time.
you were lucky.
some people bleed out internally before the disease is caught.
lucky.
I can't believe this.
you should change.
what would you have done if it were naomi?
if s had gotten sick right before the divorce?
I would've stayed.
vulvar vestibulitis.
what? I thought we were saying weird stuff.
my virgin.
she has vulvar vestibulitis.
I went through her entire medical history.
she has inflammation, probably caused by chronic yeast infections, which made her nerve endings extraordinarily sensitive to pain, which in turn made any attempt to have sex
Ouch.
that kind of pain is what caused her muscles to lock up.
so I'm gonna do trigger point injections of lidocaine and steroids in the sensitive areas.
and then you're gonna send her to pete?
no. I can fix this myself.
you can fix the vulvar vestibulitis, but pete can fix the vaginismus.
if you work together with him, the two of you will be able to give this woman a normal sex life.
why is everyone always pushing pete on me?
why are you pushing so hard against him?
wait, you want to belong here, you want to feel like you're a part of this place, you need to accept that pete is part of the solution.
wisdom coming from a cake fiend.
well, I just, um, I just take all these feelings
the, uh, rage, the exhaustion, the sexual frustration, , the desire to run sam down with my car, the fact that my child now thinks that her father is the good parent
I just take it all and I shove it down as far as it'll go, and then I just put some food on top of it.
maybe.
you should talk to sam instead of inhaling 4, 000 calories a day.
you know what?
you find your magic your way.
I'll find my magic mine.
violet said that I should cut pete some slack.
Yeah, you should.
mm, the "why" is what I'm missing.
it's the anniversary of his wife's death.
is this going to hurt?
I'm sorry. It is.
here we go.
h-how many more?
four more.
four more.
I can do four more.
I'm okay.
I can do this.
this is gonna work?
I mean, she's going through this. It's gonna work?
it will solve the cause of the vaginismus.
and then I'll get my wedding night?
dia little research, and I think my patient should try yr thing.
you want my thing?
my patient.
my patient needs your thing.
what, no comments about my dirty talk?
why are you being so nice to me?
I'm not. I.
can you help or not?
I have an opening at 3: 00.
she's toxic.
treatment's gonna have to be a lot more aggressive.
but.
she'll pull through?
it would help if we knew what we were dealing with, the contaminant.
girls.
thiis very, very serious.
did you eat anything, touch anything that you're not supped to?
mommy promises not to get mad.
it would really help erin if you tell.
you ordered these antibody studies for karen adams, room 1001?
I did.
as chief of staff, I can't sign off on this.
these studies are obviously unnecessary.
I had to confirm a diagnosis.
and since when has that been against hospital policy?
since your patient-- this karen adams
was diagnosed with wegener's disease at this hospital six months ago.
wait, how is that possible?
she just started exhibiting symptoms.
that's what she told you.
these records speak for themselves.
she knew.
and she never told her husband.
Hey, charlotte king just called.
unnecessary tests on karen adams?
I've got a patient who's lying to me about her medical condition.
it's not my fault.
if we could just tell doug that karen's been lying to him, he would leave her.
we can'T. We can't reveal her medical information to anyone, including her husband, without her approval.
doctor-patient confideiality.
she's a patient.
she's your patient.
and your patient is messing with my patient's happiness.
three years of kick-ass therapy down the drain with one swift diagnosis.
maybe they'll work it out.
I mean, people do make marriages work.
they won't make it work.
she'll end up hating him.
and he'll hate himself for staying.
after she's gone, that's all he'll have.
so I think if you can find a way to help your patient, you do it.
Hey, the hospital sent over these results on erin merring.
I still don't know how these girls are getting exposed.
I can't even get them to talk to me.
well, what are they into?
uh, fluffy.
pink pinkness?
okay, so go there, too. Commit.
give 'em what they want.
Oh, you and your cake.
they are women, cooper.
tiny blue women, but still women.
Yeah, no.
I didn't get into this deal because I'm a clown.
what, I'm supposed to play with my patients?
I put a sticker on my stethoscope.
that's as far as I go.
and erin's lying there getting sicker.
commit to the cake, man.
who wants to play?
come on in.
make yourselves comfortable.
I'll be right there.
flowers opening.
rivers parting.
I gotta go give out the ol' pete special.
okay, what?
it's just, naomi told me what this week is.
the anniversary.
it's nothing.
where exactly are we going?
a secret place.
Ooh, you have a secret place?
we have a magic castle.
but first we gotta get through the fortress.
the fence is the fortress.
come on.
sit down.
awesome castle.
Magicastle.
it makes you see stars.
see?
Oh, stars.
the stars make me dizzy.
me, too.
me three.
see?
see the stars, how they go all funny?
the stars make you dizzy.
Dr. Bennet.
I told you we don't need a therapist.
you are not my patient.
I am here for doug.
and I'm here for you, karen.
now I have your medical records here.
would you like for me to discuss them in front of doug?
or would you like doug to leave the room with violet?
it's up to you, because as your doctor,
I cannot discuss what's in here in front of him without your permission.
Why--why would i have to leave the room?
this isn't fair. You can't do this.
I am not discussing anything without your permission.
either doug can stay in here with you and sam, or he can come out in the hall and talk to me.
so I knew I was sick before.
so what?
I didn't think you could take it.
I thought you'd run away like the weakling you are, so.
I didn't tell you.
but you knew you were sick all--all this time?
I thought you were a weak, whiny pain in the ass.
but you surprised me.
you didn't run.
so it proves that you're not weak.
you're strong, and need you.
I need your strength.
I want you to stay.
what do you want, doug?
you've been coming to see mefor 36 months
36 months and thousands and thousands of dollars.
you came and you worked.
all so you could say what you want.
you've earned yourself a very expensive backbone.
use it.
what do you want?
you promised.
I'm talkinto doug.
what I want.
what I want.
I want to stay.
Doug, you- - I want to stay. All right?
end of discussion.
I'm staying with karen.
I'm staying with my wife.
good-bye. - Thanks.
good luck tonight. - Take care.
for what it's worth- - don't say anything nice to me.
I wasn't. - You were.
I don't need your pity.
I don't need your sympathy.
I was going to say, whatever you did in there for cathleen, I hope it works.
they deserve to have a perfect night.
I get a little.
I need.
I'm a little lost here.
my wife went to sleep beside me in bed on a tuesday night.
on wednesday morning, I woke up, and she was dead.
one bad night, but.
all our nights were bad.
and we never had a perfect night.
not even our wedding night.
nothing's perfect.
nothing's ever perfect.
that's the most he's ever told anybody about his wife.
the, uh, castle in your neighbor's yard is full of toxic fumes from open bags of fertilizer.
that's what made them sick?
Yeah, they were inhaling ammonium nitrate.
first it turned 'em blue, then it attacked their nervous systems.
they play in the yard.
I never thought they'd get beyond the fence.
well, you know, they kinda kick ass so.
mom.
can they sit in my bed?
be gentle. Okay?
I'm sorry.
I-I know how much.
you cared, how hard you worked.
U worked.
you did most of it.
I-I may not be in love with her, but.
I owe her.
no one should have to go through what she's going through alone.
she doesn't have to be- - I just wanted to say,
I-I still think we did something here.
I mean, before I met you, things just happened to me.
I made a choice today.
but you're still picking what's safe, what's familiar, pain that won't even make her better.
what about- - what I want.
is for you to be the therapist and me to be the patient.
it's my life.
at least now I know I've made my bed.
nobody else.
you're right.
it's your choice.
and you made it.
and that is something.
Thanks.
it's not raining.
Yeah.
yippee.
I'm starting to agree with you.
out the magic?
thank you.
That--that's-- thank you.
okay, so, um, just call me tonight, okay?
mom- - just--just call me, okay?
will you make sure she calls me?
okay.
quiet down in there.
double fudge with chocolate frosting.
you know what?
enough with the cake.
I don't want your cake.
I don't need your cake.
I-I didn't ask for your cake.
I'm all caked out.
you know whose cake I want?
I want sam's cake.
I want sam's cake, but sam's not baking a cake.
he's not baking a cake for me.
so could you just- - nai.
dell, she's, uh, she's goin' off sugar for a while.
I'm not gonna stop bringing you cake.
all right, dell, dell, no more cake.
you know what? It's just that maya likes sam better, you're mad at me for bringing you here, and this boy is baking cakes at me!
you know what? We're gonna get through this.
we are? - Yes.
Yes, we are all gonna get through is.
that's why you have us.
we're gonna get through this together.
Just--when is something good gonna happen?
when is--when is there gonna be a little
magic?
Yeah, that's the unending question.
you drank all the orange juice.
you hogged the covers.
you put our dog to sleep.
you never took my side.
you were mean to me.
you withheld sex.
you were cold.
you were a mean, cold bitch!
and I hate you!
I hate you so much!
I'm sorry I couldn't save you.
Hi, babe. It's me. I'm gonna be late.
you should pick up some chinese and we'll eat in bed, okay?
love you.
message deleted.
way to be a man.
thank you!
you're amazing. Thank you.
thank you so much.
uh, uh, pete helped.
Dr. Wilder- - thank you.
thank you.
I love you, man.
what did they do that was so great?
Yeah, what did they do?
they saved a marriage.
magic?
magic.
I'm going for sexy but. but, uh, not slutty.
smart but not boring.
it's a little.
P. T.A. Mom-bake sale.
is it really?
who. who is this guy?
do you like him? Is he cute?
he asked me out on a date.
I-I haven't been on a date since c-college.
he could be a homeless troll for all I care. I love him. I love him.
I love him because I'm going on a date.
Oh, he's here.
will you please just. just tell him I'll be down in a second?
all right.
coming.
Cooper and I are next door at sam's playing poker and having some drinks. I thought you'd want to join us.
you want to join us?
you're a little bit drunk.
and you, too, could be a little bit drunk.
you're drunk and you're flirty. Go away.
or.
I could come in, and we could actually get to know one another outside of work.
you're attracted to me. You admitted it.
Yeah.
well, I'm not attracted to you anymore.
good night, pete.
you're attracted to me right now.
What'd you do with my date?
that wasn't your date.
it was my date.
my unsuitable, flirty, drunk.
oh-so-attractive date.
you have a really packed day, so I had them add an extra shot.
Oh, bless yoU.
today's files. And, um, I think 7-down is "requited."
nice.
Thanks.
so.
how'd it go?
not so good. I am so out of practice.
all I could talk about was, was uteruses and, and sperm and eggs.
I think the guy thought I was trying tget a baby out of him.
he left skid marks, he drove away so fast.
it's not easy getting back out there.
I had a date last week.
it was a complete nightmare.
the guy spent the whole night asking advice.
you're dating?
everybody's dating.
except me.
good morning, addison.
okay, I've got angie padgett and her husband ray coming in for a follow-up.
she's ovulating, so the fertility issue may be with ray.
I see that marilyn sullivan's coming in?
it's actually her daughter tess. She fell down and hurt her arm.
she did, again?
uh, I'll drop by.
I've, uh, got some samples of this new M. S.
I can pitch in if anybody needs me today.
me, too. I'm booked, but, you know, just all routine stuff.
Hey, you, you want to help me get angie pregnant?
man, I wish that was as dirty ait sounded.
Yeah, being able to make a couple happy, that's the good stuff.
you will love the fertility game.
Yeah, I will.
okay, on the count of three. One, two.
I'm sorry. How'd this happen?
I missed the curb when I was walking home from the bus.
I'm a klutz.
she reads while she's walking.
one time, she nearly wandered into traffic.
you should talk. I mean, you read at the movies.
only the ones you drag me to.
okay. Well, reading is good.
reading while walking. not so much.
Dr. Sam, the famous writer.
no, you're the one.
you're the one. That thing in the "times magazine" last week was great.
I sit on my ass all day. I have a lot of time to think.
here.
is everything okay at home? -Yeah.
still just the two of you?
no, mom does a lot of dating 'cause guys dig M. S.
cause this bruise on your arm, it looks like someone grabbed you, hard.
you know, if something wasn't right at home or school, I might be able to help.
I suck at walking. That's the crisis.
don't freak out on me, Dr. Freedman.
all right.
good news, angie. Your tests came back. Everything is fine.
you are fertile. And you still have plenty of viable eggs left.
okay. That'S.
I was worried.
great. That's great, honey, but, um, does.
let's not race to any conclusions.
we're just gonna run some tests on you, ray, and then we'll go from there.
okay. Two doctors.
I'm sensing twins.
all right. Let's start with a sperm sample.
uh, Dr. Bennett in? Sam?
Yeah, but he's busy with a patient.
can you call him on the, uh, the.
intercom?
Yeah. Is it.
does it not look urgent?
I walked here. on foot.
okay.
I don't know if you can count insomnia as hospital business.
I've h three hours in three days.
place wouldn't run without me, not that you care about the.
there.
Yeah. -This is what I'm talking about.
aphasia.
Yeah, that comes with sleep deprivation.
obviously I cannot do my job if I can't m-m-make.
words? -Words.
all right. Any shortness of breath when you lie down, chest pains?
no. And no.
I've run all the tests. thyroid, everything.
it's. it's all fine.
yesterday I parked my car somewhere.
sorry. -It's not funny.
if this got out at st. Ambrose.
all right, now I can prescribe a sleep aid.
no pills. They don't work for me.
well, there are some new options.
no pills.
I had a little problem.
what kind of a problem? -The kind I'm not talking about anymore.
can you help me or not?
Yeah, okay.
uh, well, I guess we could go with the alternative route. I could speak to pete.
fine.
send me to the quack.
I don't want to date.
I mean, I do, but I want someone with purpose, someone real, someone who wants a future.
someone who wants kids?
is that desperate? -No.
no, it's not desperate. It'S.
focused. -Right?
my point is, you are out there looking.
I mean, even violet is out there looking. Maybe I should be out there looking for what I want.
Yeah, and what you want is a husband and kids.
Dr. Bennett, Dr. Montgomery.
Angie. Ray's up, uh, at the lab still, but good news.
his tests are viable. Everything's gonna be fine.
Yep, there should be no reason why the two of youcan't get pregnant.
Oh, no, no, no. I was hoping.
you all right?
when ray comes back, you have to tell him he's infertile.
I'm sorry?
you have to tell him it's his fault we can't get pregnant.
you've been lying to your husband about trying to have children?
not exactly. I just.
I just was on the pill for years. And then I got a cervical cap.
that's lying.
I have my reasons.
which are?
I just. I don't want to have kids.
look, ray. he comes from a big family.
he's good and kind, and he adores me so much.
how can you tell someone who loves you like that that you don't want to make a baby with them?
I'm sorry, but we can't lie to him about his test results.
then what am I gonna do?
talk to your husband.
it's more complicated than it sounds.
I think the lie that you've been telling is far worse than the truth.
no, it's not.
there you are. I'm all done.
what now?
now.
now we go home and keep trying.
okay. Good-B.
can I just say.
Whoa? -Right.
I always thought sleep was for the weak.
would you put that thing away?
now I just lie there. It's torture.
insomnia is not caused by how you sleep.
it's caused by how you live. And this isn't helping.
no e-mails.
close your eyes.
try to relax.
it's hard to relax when you're sticking quarters on my head.
I'm stimulating the sleep center of the brain with magnets.
so.
you went to medical school, suffered through residency like the rest of us.
you could be saving lives right now.
why did you ditch the good stuff for magnets and hoodoo?
what I do is the good stuff.
now shh.
move it, coop.
there's people who actually pay me to lie on that couch.
I'm reviewing tess sullivan's film from her last doctor.
she had a humerus fracture when she was younger from a fall. -Okay.
except as I suspected, she actually had a spiral fracture of her humerus.
you know how you get that? Someone grabs your arm and twists it so hard, it snaps.
so someone hurt her on purpose.
more fun facts.
these records from before tess and marilyn transferred here, she had multiple falls and accidents.
Cooper, if it's abuse, it's usually the adult in the house.
her daughter loves her. Everybody loves her. Sam loves her.
doesn't mean it's not happening.
and now I have to call child protective services to protect my patient from sam's patient.
you're afraid of killing people, aren't you?
excuse me?
that's why you waste your time with the new age stuff.
you're afraid of killing someone.
I'm lying here wide awake. The thought occurs. That's all.
okay, look.
it's almost 6: 00. I'm gonna send you home with a cd of music and meditation.
try it tonight and report back.
great. Next you'll be giving me "baby einstein.
no.
no. There's no way marilyn sullivan would. would hurt tess.
she's always coming in with scratches and bruises.
maybe it's. it's a kid at school.
I talked to the school. That's not it.
well, it's not marilyn. -Why?
because she's funny? Because she's a writer?
no, because she's decent. All right?
she's handling her disease, her kid.
the woman is two years away from a wheelchair. You can't just do this on a hunch.
what about the next time, sam?
what, I ignore this and the next time tess ends up in a hospital or wor?
unless you are absolutely sure, you have no business putting these people through this.
if you're not sure, you're meddling, not helping.
you're here early. -Yeah.
Yeah, thanks.
you have reached the los angeles county department of children and family services child protection hotline.
Hey, she's back.
who? -Angie.
Liar-liar-pants-on-fire angie.
well, what. what do we do?
we throw her ass out of our practice.
come on.
Hey. -Okay.
Thanks, dell. -Here you go.
I know I shouldn't have come back, but I looked up Dr. Montgomery on the interne you're a genetic specialist, right?
Yes.
well, I thought about what you said, that it's better to know the truth.
so you told ray that you don't want to have any kids?
no.
not that.
Angie, I don't think we can help you here.
you have to. You have to help me.
I need to know. I need to know the truth.
the truth about what?
I need you to tell me whether or not I'm dying.
Huntington's disease?
it's a genetic disorder that causes. -a degeneration of brain cells. We know.
so then you know how horrible it is.
you lose control of your body, your brain atrophies, you can't talk, you can't eat.
you just slowly die in this.
this shell.
my mom had it.
my grandmother had it.
and you think you might have it?
if her mother had it, she has a 50-50 chance of inheriting the gene.
and if I have the gene, I have a 100% chance of dying from the disease.
but you've never been tested?
I just wanted to live my life.
and then I met ray.
and he doesn't know that you could have huntington's?
I wasn't looking to get married.
it was just dating.
and then we were in love. And then.
I had waited too long to tell him.
and he loved me so much, I didn't want to scare him.
I didn't want to scare me.
but now. -he wants to have children.
I can't have a baby knowing I could pass this on.
I can't have a baby if I'm gonna die.
last night, ray and i were watching tv in bed.
and he was thinking up baby names.
and my heart started to hurt.
physically hurt.
I want to think up baby names.
I want to grow old with thiman and our kids and our grandkids.
and I thought.
maybe I don't have the gene.
maybe I won't get sick.
maybe. -maybe knowing the truth is better than hiding from it.
I want the test.
I want to know.
I want to live.
haven't you people heard of an expiration date?
no, no, no. Those are, those are.
noodles don't go bad.
Oh, she's back. What.
throwing away people's noodles.
I'm here because. surprise.
can you keep your hands off my food, please?
did you make the call? -Yeah.
Hey, violet, we have a patient we may need you to see. Angie?
she still lyingto her husband?
it's a little more complicated than that. She might have a terminal illness.
de's preparing an exam room, and I'm gonna draw her blood in a few minutes.
you need to eat. -I can'T.
can you imagine? She finds the perfect guy, she's got a great marriage, they want kids.
she was living the dream.
not everybody has that dream.
violet doesn't believe in children.
she acknowledges they exist because they scream in her restaurants, but that's about it.
I used to be like that before I had maya.
I was, and then I had her, and. I'm not saying it's a dream.
but it's. it's pretty darn close.
you really don't want childre look, not everybody is cut out for it.
and it is incredibly hard for a woman to admit that she doesn't want kids.
cause they're basically admitting they're men.
Oh, okay, no. Just because you've apparently moved in.
it's not a disease, you know?
a woman can be alone and be fulfilled, very.
try saying that like you mean it.
why isn't she sleeping?
Pete's working on it. Excuse me.
uh, angie's set up in exam room two.
uh, the sullivans, from yesterday, they're. they're back and they're very angry.
I asked you to wait.
he did the right thing, sam.
you don't know that!
excuse me.
there's a social worker in our home.
he called a social worker on me.
once I suspect, legally, I have to call the authorities.
but you're wrong.
what does he think, the handicapped woman beats her daughter with cane?
I-I think he was just worried a-about the nature of tess' injury.
I know you didn't fall off a curb.
I help my mom when she has a flare, all right?
she fell down, she grabbed my arm, and it got tweaked.
I fell.
I reached out and I grabbed tess' arm. It was an accident.
then why didn't you just say that?
because. people like Dr. Freedman get the wrong idea.
has that happened before, people getting the wrong idea? You've had a lot of injuries.
she has M. S. She falls.
but my mom would never hurt me on purpose. She wouldn't.
she's my whole world. I would never hurt her, not on purpose.
please believe me, sam.
she's my girl. If they take her away from me.
I believe you.
if they take me away from her, I won't forget you, forever.
I like the name margaret for a girl.
we could call her maggie or meg.
or henry for a boy.
Angie, if the tests come back positive, you'll need to tell ray.
do you have children?
no.
but you want them.
I do.
have you thought of baby names?
it works for a boy or a girl.
don't piss dell off.
he was weighing in on a case. I call that overstepping his bounds.
I need him here to keep this place running.
is that all you need him for?
what, you heard I went on a date, and now you're gonna take it out on dell?
no, but you guys got some kind of a thing going.
there's no "thing. " Do I like that a cute boy thinks I'm pretty?
Yes.
could I ever take it seriously? No.
he's a child, sam.
just.
leave it alone.
all right.
shouldn't you be in there, administering your heang touch?
shush. It might be asleep.
it?
you're enjoying this, aren't you, seeing me tortured?
mm, it is satisfying.
Hey, why did you come to my house the other night? Really?
I thought we could have fun.
I'm not looking for fun.
Sam told me that you're the marrying kind of woman.
I am.
I've been married.
I don't plan on ever going down that road again.
so if you want fun, I'm here.
if you want more. -I should.
look elsewhere. -Addison.
it's not working! I'm not sleeping!
and still satisfying.
go.
make it sleep.
obviously you'll be expected to testify, Dr. Freedman.
now tomorrow is the hearing.
that's fast.
we move fast. We have to.
now if the judge decides it's an unsafe home environment, the girl would be taken immediately into foster care.
what about the mother? -What about her?
well, if tess gets taken away, marilyn shouldn't be left alone. She has M. S.
that's not our department's concern. Our concern is the child.
I should say, um, tess is pretty insistent that there's no abuse.
well, that's not unusual. The child protects the parent, even rationalizes the behavior.
and what if tess is telling the truth?
that's why there's a judge.
but the medical testimony carries a lot of weight, and I'm sure Dr. Freedman did not make this call lightly.
Angie, this is, uh, Dr. Violet turner. She's our psychiatrist.
I thought you were just gonna tell me my test results.
Oh I have it.
I really have it.
but as of now, you have no symptoms. You could go years before you show any sign of illness.
illness?
you mean dementia, violent rages, wetting myself?
a lot of research they're doing with repression proteins is very promising.
hopefully, in time.
Oh, I don't have time, Dr. Bennett. Time is the one thing I don't have.
I've got a great life, an amazing husband, but no time.
damn it. I am so out of time.
I know this is a lot to process.
but you're not alone.
you have ray.
no.
no, I knew what I was getting into when I took that test.
that stupid, stupid test.
Angie. -why don't you stay?
we can talk.
I can't, but thank you, all of you, for trying to help.
well, what about ray?
what do you. -don't worry.
I know what I have to do.
I'm begging you. -Oh, no.
I have tried acupuncture, massage, pressure points, melatonin supplements, aromatherapy, sound therapy.
and I can tell it's not working because she's still bitching at me.
Charlotte needs a shrink.
Yeah, agreed, in more ways than one, but. -squeeze her in.
I.
this is co-op medicine, and I'm referring.
you need to co-op. Now.
90% of sleep issues are psychological.
fine. Shrink away.
when you sleep, do you toss and turn, thrash around a lot?
how would I know? I'm asleep.
Yeah, I realize that.
well, that. that's where a partner could be helpful.
uh, the last time you slept with someone else.
was years ago.
so you haven't had sex in.
I have sex.
they just don't sleep over. -Ever?
are you asking because you're interested in my well-being, or because you're secretly thrilled to find someone who's as alone as you are?
just because I don't want a child?
I'm fine.
I am better than fine, in fact. I.
let's just stay on you.
Dr. Montgomery.
Hey, ray. How are you?
how's angie? -Gone.
she's gone. Angie left me.
I came home, and I found her packing a suitcase, and.
she said that her appointment here was like some kind of wake-up call, and then she just left.
and that's all she said?
here, uh, ray, why. why don't you.
I don't understand. She spends two minutes with the two of you, and then throws in the towel on our marriage?
ray, please calm down. -No, I want to know.
what the hell did you say to my wife?
it smells like christmas in here.
it's an ayurvedic sleep remedy that might knock charlotte out.
what did you get? -Intimacy issues, severe.
she tries to alienate anybody who might get close, even people she asks for help.
sleep's triggered when you comfort yourself into a self-sedated state.
and people like charlotte.
chances are nobody ever really nurtured her, taught her how to self-soothe.
nurture her, pete. Be kind.
people have babies in this bed?
we change the sheets. Promise.
go ahead and close your eyes. Relax.
you're smiling like an idiot.
I'm staying positive.
Oh, brother.
people need connection to stay healthy, positive connection with another human.
look, I don't.
I don't need your pity positivity.
I don't know what violet told you, but I connect, okay?
Yeah, when?
none of your bus. -business, right.
you know what? Maybe.
I'm not the guy to help you. Maybe you need someone.
who I can't irritate.
find that man for me, and I'll marry him.
my family didn't believe in displays.
of affection?
my mother.
there was the occasional sloppy kind that followed cocktails.
and since then?
who has time for that kind of thing?
I'm sorry, charlotte.
do you want to try again?
why not?
my hair's already shot.
can you drop these at the lab for me?
Thanks.
um, ahem, marilyn sullivan called for you again.
I'm not allowed to speak to her until after the hearing.
don't start, man. There's nothing vague about the law.
I suspect and. -tess wrs long sleeves a lo
what?
well, even when it's, like, 95 degrees outside, down over her hands.
and does she ever look at you, I mean, like, really look you in the eye?
not really, no. -Right.
when she has appointments without her mom, she shows up early, she hangs out after, like she doesn't want to go home.
I've seen that.
how do you know all this?
uh, because I did the same thing when I was in her situation.
it's what you do.
all right, I'll get the lab right on this.
fascinating.
she's been here all night?
she snores?
God, asleep, she looks almost harmless.
mm, like a sleeping tiger.
don't wake the tiger.
I have to go, um, and put my tie on for tess' hearing.
he needs you.
he put her to sleep.
he actually did it. -yep.
Angie's here.
she finally responded to our phone messages.
well, we got her to come back. That's something.
any ideas on what we say to her? -No.
you said the baby making game would be fun I am not having fun.
Oh, god. Me neither.
not with this one.
mm, it's not. it's not fair.
good people should get to have what they want.
I was heading to the airport.
you said there was something with ray?
ray came by to see us yesterday.
he was worried sick about you, not to mention confused and hurt.
you didn't tell him, did you? You cannot tell him.
Angie, he is your husbD. He deserves to know the truth.
let him think I left him.
let him hate me.
then he can move on, find someone, be happy.
he's happy with you.
but. he's gonna.
I'm gonna get so sick.
I'm gonna die.
I don't want to die.
you have a disease.
and you will die. That's the truth.
hiding it from ray is not gonna change that.
but the bigger truth, the better truth.
is that you are alive now.
you're living, and you should get.
you should get everything that life has to offer.
you should get what you want.
you should get to have a child and a family and ray.
just because you're sick doesn't mean you don't get to live your life.
go home.
tell ray the truth, tell him what the future is, and let him decide.
a person.
should get to have a whole life.
didn't allan wear yellow tie. Did you bring me one of allan's old ties?
I bought this tie for you.
today you become a man.
Yeah.
what are you gonna say?
you shouldn't really be. -what are you gonna say?
I'll tell you if you roll up your sleeves.
so whatever.
she hits me a little.
but she's sorry.
afterward, I mean.
she's really sorry.
and it's not like I couldn't hit her back. I mean, look at her.
but I don't need to hit her.
she needs to hit someone. Her life sucks.
Tess, everyone has pain.
so why can't this just be mine?
what time is it?
tomorrow? -Today. Well, y-yes.
today is your tomorrow.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
this is. oh, god.
it'll wash out.
I mixed you a tonic to take home with you. It should help you fall asleep more easily tonight.
I don't need your potions.
Really? It kinda seemed like you did.
don't throw yourself a party.
you don't have me figured out.
I said some things when I was loopy. Probably just hit a wall.
I hit a wall and.
it happened to be here.
okay.
Dr. Freedman, would you please explain to the court the injuries you've noticed on tess over the last year?
sorry. That's all right.
sorry. Thanks.
in the last year, um, two lacerations, multiple contusions and abrasions.
plus the recent wrist fracture.
and in your opinion, is there any way that the injury could have occurred other than by the intentional twisting of the child's arm?
no, there's not.
thank you very much, Dr. Freedman.
wait, can I, can I just say one more thing?
sure. -Okay?
I've known tess for a little while now, and she is a great kid, so tough.
she doesn't let anybody see her cry. I don't even know if she does cry.
but it doesn't matter how strong she is.
some things, a kid should never have to take.
being hurt, being hit by someone who is supposed to love and protect you.
you don't have to take that, tess.
you can't take it.
because once you let yourself shut down like that, you're not a kid anymore.
uh, I'm okay, I'm done talking.
you can return to the gallery. Thank you, Dr. Freedman.
they're taking her away from me.
I can't. Not now, Marilyn.
it's not right. I'm her mother.
I'm her mother，sam.
right. You're her mother.
don't tell me you believe them.
I'm not evil. I made a mistake.
I love my daughter.
that kid.
all she wants is her mom.
I didn't want to see it.
and I should have.
I should've.
excuse me.
we know we don't have an appointment but, uh.
no, please.
come in.
so, um, the fertility tests, they came back fine for both of us. So we can make a baby?
we want to share what life I have left with a child.
and we were wondering if there was something you could do to make me pregnant sooner rather than later.
because angie doesn't have a lot of time.
I just want to make sure that you understand.
Oh, I. I understand.
Angie will die.
sooner than we want.
Angie will, uh.
but that's the future.
and I don't care what happens tomorrow or in a few years.
we have this now. We have us now.
there is still the risk that the child will have the gene.
we know.
we're willingto take that chance.
I mean, if everyone who had the gene was never born, I never.
I never would've met angie.
but I really.
Naomi, they want us to help them make a baby.
a person gets to have her whole life?
a person gets to have her whole life.
so you're a convert now?
just covering my bases.
well, I am sure pete appreciates your gratitude.
Pete doesn't need it.
he congratulates himself enough for all of us.
but damn.
he has good hands, doesn't he?
what would you be doing right now if you were angie?
you mean I-if I knew.
knew how limited your time was. If you knew.
pretty much what I'm doing right now.
check you out. all zen.
also known as margarita number two.
I'd be on a plane to somewhere spectacular with maya.
what about you?
I.
I don't know.
I'm going for more serenity.
baby girl.
thank you.
liar.
Where's your power tie?
Oh, I took it off. I didn't want to throw up on it.
plan on throwing up tonight.
Cooper. because of you.
Tess knows that an adult saw her and cared enough to protect her.
how many times have we met marilyn sullivan?
did you ever think that.
Yeah. That's why people who shouldn't have children shouldn't have children.
and you count yourself among those people. You're crazy.
you would never. -well, who knows?
I don't think anybody who had a child ever thought , oh, boy, now I have something I can hit.
violet, you are the most caring, generous person I know.
Yeah, and the most neurotic, the most self-involved.
look, you're telling me that if you met the right man and fell in love.
and he wanted to, you wouldn't even consider it?
you would.
you would.
um, sam told me about how you helped with tess.
if you ever want to talk or need some help.
I'm okay.
you do a lot for the practice.
you are the practice.
you keep it running. the way you deal with the patients, the way you care.
your dream is what started it in the first place.
and sam's. -And sam's.
but I do it for you.
Charlotte king says.
you have good hands.
what?
I-I.
okay.
it's okay. I was just.
no, no, no, no. -Just, um.
having some fun?
no.
I don't want fun, and a person should get what she wants.
what does that mean?
good night, pete.
what does that mean? You can't just kiss a person and.
good night, Pete
what do you say we just see how it goes.
tonight?
he stood me up.
you and me, friends with benefits, tonight.
what time should I come over?
you're not some random girl from the internet.
with you it doesn't mean nothing. It never will.
all right. Get out.
I am so sick and tired of being the only person in this practice who thinks!
is violet here?
uh, no, not yet, but, um. oh, okay.
Oh, morning. You've got a.
morning.
Hi. Good morning.
Naomi? -Uh, yeah. She's right.
is naomi.
what's up with everybody? Was there, like, a car accident on the way to work or something? What.
or something.
milk? -Oh, thanks.
they're behind closed doors.
who?
the women.
if they're gonna talk about us, we should talk about them.
Yeah.
let's talk.
let's talk smack.
I just need ten minutes with naomi.
I need ten minutes with naomi first.
she slept with cooper. She slept with pete.
cats out of the bag, all that.
she didn't sleep with pete. -She didn't sleep with cooper.
how did you know that? -How'd you know that?
there are no secrets around here. -I know!
Ooh, there are secrets.
I mean, I didn't know.
neither one of you? Really?
I didn't. I didn't know. That's all I'm saying.
Pete literally stood me up.
I don't get stood up. I'm addison.
uh, which means something.
in places where.
things mean things. I was humiliated.
were you completely naked?
did you stand in front of him like a peeled banana while he looked over your best parts?
because I have good parts, and cooper passed on them.
I have good parts.
damn right, you do. And so do I.
I like your breasts.
you have a good ass.
thank you. I like it.
the point is we should not be having sex in the office.
who's having sex in the office?
no one.
no one, that's the point.
it gets complicated.
you just. you. you don't know where you stand.
what do you think they're saying about us?
you know what?
who cares?
Yeah. Who cares?
the guys are still in the kitchen.
how am I gonna get my coffee? I need my coffee.
can we skip the morning meeting? What do we do in that meeting anyway?
there is no morning meeting today. -Thank you.
because charlotte king is coming by to walk us. all of us.
through the safe surrender program.
that's today. -Yeah.
I signed up with pete.
I am in control.
I work here.
I'm moving on.
but I'm getting my coffee from downstairs.
Oh, small nonfat chai latte. -Frappuccino, extra whipped.
blame the guy up front. -Sorry?
the guy at the front of the line, he just ordered a coffee with, like, seven descriptive words in front of it.
you should blame him if you're running late.
Oh, I work upstairs. I just have a meeting to get to.
not a big deal.
well, you can go in front of me.
you look important. I'm.
I'm guessing this meeting won't go on without you.
thank you.
I'm carl, by the way.
stop me now if you had amnesia or you were bleeding to death in an E. R.
Addison, I. -no? Good.
here's the deal.
I take full responsibility for last night.
I was warned repeatedly, by you, no less, and I should know by now that when someone tells you who they are, you should believe them.
I can work with you, but personally, you've been downgraded to acquaintance. I'm moving on.
fair enough.
we have coffee here. -Shut up.
what is wrong with everybody?
okay, safe surrender rundown. montgomery, you and pete are the go-to team.
am I wrong? That's what I have here.
no, that's right. We volunteered last week.
good times. Happier times.
so the cell phone, that's all they need?
well, for the next 48 hours, all calls placed to the safe surrender hotline will be rerouted to that phone.
don't stray far from here or from each other.
fine. That's fine.
these calls are from women who want to give up their babies?
most of 'em have given birth already, and they can't or don't want to keep their babies.
they call from school bathrooms, friend's places.
they're too scared to go to hospitals where they have to provide their names.
so we arrange for a place to meet them, they surrender the baby to us and then what?
you can bring the babies back here. Dr. Freedman can do the exaMs.
and if the babies are healthy?
then you call social services.
and most important, don't forget the bracelets.
one to the mom, one on the baby's wrist or ankle.
if the birth mother changes her mind, she has two weeks to reclaim the child.
the biggest victory for safe surrender is when that baby's placed with someone who wants 'em.
if it's the mom, all the better.
that's all I have time for.
any questions, call me.
nothing charlotte king likes better than bossing people around, huh?
practically glowing.
Cooper, safe surrender saves hundreds of babies a year.
it's really an amazing thing that she's doing.
how did you feel about the homework I gave you last week?
well, I didn't think ias an "imagine yourself on a warm beach" kinda guy.
But?
but every time I started to feel anxious,
I thought about the mediterranean, it worked.
well.
maybe you're ready for some more homework.
bring it on.
let's identify something that would've triggered you in the past, something you'd like to try again.
done. I, um.
I met a woman today, and we exchanged business cards.
I think I'm ready to try dating again.
we didn't forget how.
I tell ya that.
no, we did not.
I think we, uh.
Yeah, we didn't forget. -Nah.
so.
what do you think?
what do i think?
Yeah. I just. you know, you.
you laid it on me, so, uh, that gives you the right to speak first.
what, I laid it on you? -Ah, well.
what, because I jumped you, and you were helpless to stop me?
well, I didn't say that.
I just. was. was this a slipup, like.
like. like a onetime thing?
or, uh, w-would you.
want more here?
I don't know, sam.
I-I don't know. For once, I hadn't thought it through.
you know, the practice we barely got through it after the split.
I know.
and, uh, maya.
I mean, it's not.
not fair to maya.
we. we got divorced for a reason.
so, um.
I think it was just a slipup.
Yeah.
I, uh, I thought that, toO.
okay, good. Good.
okay. -Okay.
Hey, uh, there was a message on your voice mail.
your priest called?
you have a priest?
uh, had. Uh, we used to.
okay, yeah, well, he wants to see you, so.
me?
uh, both of you, together, as soon as possible. It sounded kind of serious.
What'd you do, commit a mortal sin?
God's trying to tell us something.
it's a coincidence.
no. We. we have sex, and then the day after, our priest summons us?
that's the fires of hell, sam. We had sex.
just don't mention we got a divorce.
I don't need a lecture.
play it cool. -yeah, everything's cool.
thank you so much for coming.
we had sex, and. and we're divorced.
Oh, naomi.
I'm sorry. He's. he's. he's our priest.
I can't lie to him.
I, uh, I-I.
I'm gonna let that go for now.
I'm also gonna overlook the fact that you two have been christmas and eastering it for the last ten years.
look, I called you about one of the nuns.
it's sister helen. She's sick.
well, don't know what it is.
she's 86. She hates hospitals.
I thought of you two.
Sam, this is your area.
Naomi, I thought having a woman would make her more comfortable.
H-has she been ill for a while?
uh, sister amy would know.
the sisters have been sequestered alone together for.
sequestered? -For three weeks.
St. Mary's is our mother house.
we spend most of the year on missions around the world.
so this is the one time of year we get to see each other.
this is the first time I've been outside these walls in the last three weeks.
all right. So, please.
father mark?
no, I'm not supposed to enter.
no one from outside the sisterhood, but they need you. You're good catholics, you're doctors.
well, doctors at least.
go on. I'll. I'll wait for you here.
Oh, it's all right, sister helen.
she's a doctor. It's all right.
when did she start feeling bad?
a week or so ago. She said she felt like she was getting the flu.
she's the only one of us who doesn't complain of aches and pains, so we noticed.
what's this?
it's definitely not the flu.
=www. ydy. com/bbs=- Proudly Presents
still don't want to talk, cooper.
but I want to talk.
well, there'a world wide web out there waiting for you.
I'm sure you can find someone who will listen.
I can just grab the peanut butter and.
men.
they're overrated.
dating is overrated.
sex is. -Don't.
don't say something you're gonna regret.
Hello, addison montgomery.
Carl. Hi.
Yes, I would love to have coffee.
but I am on call for work today, so.
you sure?
okay, then. Uh, yes, I will.
see you later.
B-bye.
I have a date tonight. -You don't.
you don't want to move too fast, addison, not with a guy you barely know.
Unhand me, woman.
I'm getting my date on.
it would help if we could precisely identify the rash.
Yeah. I don't have my derm atlas on me.
wait.
sister virginia, could you, um.
Oh, yes, of course. -Thank you.
sister. -Okay.
here we go.
I'm gonna send it to dell.
see if he can't find someone to identify it.
how is she feeling?
well, we may need to get sister helen to a hospital.
we'll do everything we can to keep her here.
but we can't treat her until we know what kind of an infection she has.
Yeah, and we're also gonna need to check the other sister to see if it's contagious.
you ever seen a rash like this?
can't say that I have.
I'm tracking down an infectious disease specialist to see if we can get an answer.
um, I'm done with my patients for the day, but I'll be back later.
uh, ring me if we get a safe surrender call.
I'll be just down the street. I've got a thing.
a thing?
Yes.
well, don't drink. Friends don't let friends drink and save babies.
I think addison has a dateonight.
well, good for her. She's getting back on the horse.
I'm about to have a date tonight. -Really?
what? I don't believe in dwelling. I believe in getting back on the horse.
well, I'll leave you to it.
he's a lucky guy.
who is? -Addison's horse.
you. you feel a little clammy.
I'm fine.
I spend most of the year ministering to people in uganda.
you ought to see what I'm exposed to there.
I'll weather sister helen's cold.
sister virginia, please.
so sister helen's temperature is 103, her resps 26.
Yeah, and now sister virginia's getting sick.
and dell still hasn't come up with anything on that rash.
all right, I think we should just get sister helen to a hospital.
I'll call the ambulance.
I already did. Uh, they're 20 minutes out.
okay.
we make a good team.
Yeah, we do.
and then I moved to L. A.
and lived happily ever after. -yes.
the life of addison montgomery in ten minutes or less.
well, you can have 11 minutes.
don't need it. Here goes.
uh, never been married.
never had kids.
want to get married.
want to have kids.
a man without baggage.
that is rare.
well, I.
have a little baggage to confess.
I'm, uh, a patient of Dr. Turner's.
I've been seeing her almost a year, and I can say, without a doubt, that she's made me a better man.
okay.
okay.
it's, um, it's refreshing to meet someone who's.
interested in being a better man.
Really? -Yes, really.
Oh, I have to take this.
Exse me.
hello.
her name is darcy.
she id to wait, she'd meet us.
it's a girl.
she's not.
she isn't crying.
I can take a look at her.
are you bleeding?
Darcy, why don't you let us take you back to the clinic?
no, you just have to take it and go. My mom's upstairs sleeping.
your mother was here in the house when you were.
I crawled on the top bunk and played my steo really loud to cover the contractions.
you cut the cord.
I clipped it.
see? With a barrette.
you made the right decision by calling.
Darcy, why don't you give me just five minutes, all right?
I'll do an exam very quickly, make sure theraren't any problems, and then you can go.
Darcy. It's a little late to have friends over.
sorry, mom.
you have to go, now.
take my card and a bracelet.
your daughter has a matching one.
I...just go.
in case you change your mind.
I won't.
Sam. -The ambulance is here.
Sam. May I show him, please?
I felt fine.
Yeah, I know. I see it. Th is not just sister helen and sister virginia.
Hey, no, no. Don't come in. Don't co in.
this building is a hot zone. We have to lock it down.
until we figure out what this is, nobody comes in, nobody goes out.
I am not leaving them.
okay, shut the door then. Shut the door.
Ambrose spoke to the C. D.C.
they said we were right to lock down until the hospitals can prep some isolation units for them.
or. us.
what do they think this is?
uh, probably a viral contagion.
considering where these nuns have been.
dell forwarded the pictures on to an infectious disease specialist, so we'll know as. as soon as he hears back.
how long until the iso unit's prepped?
six hours.
three more sisters have a fever. So that makes 8 of the 12, and.
I'm not feeling too good.
still don't think god's trying to tell us something?
you don't really think we're being punished for what we did last night?
what, just because we may have some rare, tropical probably deadly disease?
the morning after we have sex?
well, if we are sick.
I'm glad we got some.
how sentimental.
that was a joke. I was joking.
I mean, I gotta say, that kid did a pretty good job of giving birth in a bunk bed.
I did a primary check, and she's fine for now.
her lungs are good, heartbeat's strong.
we'll get cooper to do a well-baby check tomorrow.
or you can call him now.
Cooper's, uh.
out on a date.
Oh, god. He's doing his.
get back up on the horse thing.
Addison is, too, right?
you... you had your date?
how did it go?
it's okay, violet.
I know carl's your patient. He told me.
Oh, good.
good.
uh, baby blankets. We need baby blankets.
Oh, hey, you know, that. that might be the, uh, the guy, the nun rash.
so you're dating one of violet's patients? A psych patient?
Oh, please. This is L. A. You're weird if you're not seeing a shrink.
you all done, kiddo, huh?
okay.
good girl.
you sure you don't want me to call social services to come pick her up?
no, no, no. That's okay. Uh, I'll stay here tonight.
are you serious? -Yeah. You know, shshould get to feel wanted, at least for one night.
Yeah.
Oh, yes, little girl.
that's a little baby.
uh, 7 and 7.
more on the first 7, less on the second.
Charlotte king, as I live and breathe.
Oh, no, you don't. That's saved.
big date?
not a date.
far from it. I'm just meeting someone. Scoot.
I don't want him to see you and think you're here with me.
what timdid he say?
9: 00 P. M.
mm, I'm meeting someone at 9: 00, too a blonde, petite.
we met on the internet.
what?
no.
Oh, god.
Oh, my god.
no, no, no. We should laugh about the unfortunate coincidence.
laughing is the way to go.
let's be clear. This never happened.
or the opposite of laughing.
Yes, sir. I just got it.
okay.
I see, yeah.
I'll call 'em right now.
holy crap.
a patient of yours is dating addison?
I'm not allowed to discuss it. You know that.
Yes, you are.
our patients know we share files.
well, we don't if we don't have to.
okay, but on a scale from one to ten, how bad is his thing?
moving away. Not talking.
are we talking a three?
like I'm afraid of seagulls and I'm considering hypnotherapy?
I'm closing the door. I'm closing it in your face.
Oh, it's bad, huh?
we're, like, way beyond mommy issues here?
ethics, pete. Look it up.
she's tachycardic at 130. I can't get a blood pressure.
she's in septic shock.
we gotta get her to a hospital, I don't care if they're ready for us.
no, we gotta get everybody to a hospital right now. Dell just called.
what is it? -It's typhoid.
how is sister virginia?
well, she's still not responding, and her blood pressure is very unstable.
Typhoid? I didn't.
I-I thought that disappeared in, like, the early 1900s.
you know, it's.
it's a common disease in exactly the kind of third world places where the sisters work.
it's transmitted through skin-to-skin contact or food.
so you think one of the sisters caught it on a mission?
no, and that's what's troubling.
the incubation period is two weeks at the most.
and these sisters were sequestered for longer than that.
so how did they get exposed?
excuse me just one second.
I spoke with health services.
there have been no other outbreaks of typhus in this area.
and all the food in the convent tested clean.
so if it's not the food.
Sam, somebody had to have had contact with an outside carrier.
well, all the sisters are claiming that they've been completely isolated.
nobody in, nobody out.
Sam, what are we saying here?
that one of these nuns.
we're saying that somebody's lying.
you're not ready to date. Y-you're certainly not ready to quit therapy.
but I feel fine. I feel good.
this is you going off your program.
Hi.
okay, I'm. I'm just leaving some flowers for addison.
she's sleeping, so.
make sure she gets these, okay?
Thanks.
seizure?
Addison's date last night was with a patient of Violet's. Now Violet seems worried.
no way.
awesome. What's his deal?
well, if it was nothing, she would say.
you know you'd say.
just a hint.
you don't have to tell us the whole
he calls himself "trunk.
okay.
well, when I think "trunk," in relation to a guy, not necessarily a bad thing.
elephant's trunks, very large trunks.
Oh, is he freakishly large? Is he hideously.
I can't tell you!
trunk.
flowers.
how you holdin' up?
good. Little hungry.
a lot tired.
and I can, um, I can only find one shoe.
every time I tried to put her down, she started screeching like a bat.
okay, you realize I didn't actually give birth.
uh, from your psych patient.
he just dropped 'em off.
Oh, that's so sweet. Here, give me the card.
the thing is, I think carl might have some probleMs.
everybody has probleMs.
violet said his nickname is "trunk."
I don't know what that means.
I think it means.
he's not addison montgomery material. That's all.
no.
you don't know what my material is.
you've never even seen my material, remember?
so.
mind your own business.
she isn't getting any better, is she?
no, not yet.
her lungs are congested.
pressure's borderline.
I'm putting all the sisters on an aggresve course of antibiotics.
it's a dangerous disease, but the cure rate is very high for those with mild cases.
thank you, sam.
father, uh.
Naomi's gonna be asking the sisters some questions.
Oh, of course. Anything you need.
uh, is there anyone you think we should speak to?
uh, a sister that might have had contact with a typhoid carrier in the time they were sequestered?
from the outside?
maybe a sister was meeting with someone secretly?
no, no. I can't imagine someone would lie about that.
well, people keep secrets, father.
believe me.
I got a page from the E. R.
Dr. Violet turner.
Oh, hi.
um, yeah. You have a patient here.
uh, we were able to remove the foreign body nonsurgically.
he's on pain meds now.
seems to be resting comfortably.
is he gonna be okay?
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Yeah. He's, um.
he's lucky he didn't perforate his bowel.
just one question for you.
you got any idea whose shoe this is?
given the circumstances of her birth, this is a very, very healthy baby.
Yeah, did you hear that?
I heard we have something to celebrate.
you rescued a baby?
Yeah, um, what exactly happens, uh, once social services takes her?
it's out of our hands.
she'll be placed in foster care while they start the adoption process.
come here, batgirl. Yes.
Yes, it's time for a little stroll, huh?
little stroll around the office? Yeah.
batgirl?
here's a question. cotton balls at st. Ambrose.
do you.
uh, triple size.
hospital grade.
right. More cotton per ball.
good-bye, Dr. Freedman.
I didn't mean to take her shoe.
you took her shoe, carl.
and you did what you always do.
Yeah.
you need to come back to therapy.
because this is not a good way to live, is it?
no.
one more thing.
uh, can you tell addison I can't see her?
she's great. She's perfect.
but I don't trust myself around her shoes.
how do you give up your baby?
how do you give up your whole life?
I mean, falling in love, a family, all of it, just to go live in a convent.
that's why somebody's lying.
this girl. darcy.
she carried her for nine months. I've had her for one night.
one night.
and the thought of her being thrown into some foster home is killing me.
you can't have this baby, addison.
I know.
I named her.
batgirl.
okay. you just can't have kids.
Oh, nai, I wish you were here.
it's been such a weird day.
Oh, tell me about it.
I'm interrogating nuns.
I wish I were there, too.
damn it. I gotta go.
Bye.
come in.
I thought I heard you in here.
batgirl can only sleep in total darkness.
o-okay.
um, can I talk to you?
it's carl.
Carl likes you very much, but he wanted me to tell you that he.
he's not gonna be calling again.
I don't understand.
he has a medical issue that worsens under stress.
what te of issue?
it. it doesn't matter.
why do you call him "trunk"?
Oh, you know about that?
okay, uh, well, that was very.
unprofessional of me to say that.
uh, a trunk is a place where you might put all sorts of things, things you might have, uh, taken, or borrowed from another person.
in an anatomical sense.
Oh, god.
where is my shoe?
we... we can talk about this. It is nothing to be disturbed by.
it... it's an issue of control.
I am going to get up, and I'm gonna walk out of this room, and you and I are never, ever, going to speak of this again.
I would like that very much.
no change?
no. I'm sorry.
if it's all right with you, I'd like to give her the sacrament of the sick.
Oh, yeah, of course.
the graced peace of god our father and the lord jesus christ be with you.
help you "with the grace of the holy spirit.
may the lord.
the way he looks at her. -I know.
save you and raise you up.
don't be mad, but I called social services.
I meant to call. I just.
forgot. That's.
good.
I can help you pack up her stuff.
Thanks.
come on, baby.
how long till they get here?
there you go.
Oh, batgirl.
okay.
I'll be back as soon as i can, okay?
safe surrender hotline.
did she say where, exactly?
no, she just said marine park past the first parking lot.
the baby's not breathing.
there's no pulse.
Let'continue to bring up his temp with warmed oxygen and fluids.
more saline bags.
what's his core temp?
core temp is 95.
uh, let's do another round of epi.
come on, little guy.
come on, baby. Don't do this.
asystole.
Addison, you've been at this for almost an hour.
okay.
I'm gonna call it.
time of death. 10: 42 P. M.
we got there as soon as we could.
it's over.
we tried.
it's over, Pete.
Addison, we did everything we. -it's over. The baby's dead.
|W tough day.
Yeah.
I used to get off on 'em, the tough ones.
when I was a resident, I used to think, I got through this, I survived.
and the next one, I'll survive even better.
I don't.
it's days like these where I slip and make mistakes.
bad mistakes.
these long.
crappy days just.
I just need something, someone, and I end up.
falling off your wagon.
whoever your wagon may be.
we have to get back to the practice.
this is the last time I'm offering to talk.
Cooper, it's not that I don't want to talk to you.
I-I can'T.
of course you can. That's what we do.
I know.
But?
Allan obliterates my heart, and you tell me that he doesn't deserve me.
some girl named trixie uses and abuses you, and I listen to you and I tell you you're being stupid.
I-I will always be able to talk to you about someone else.
but I can't.
I can't talk to you about you.
I-I don't know how to talk about us.
not like that.
then talk to me about something else.
whatever's on your mind.
I went to the E. R.
shoved one of addison's shoes up his.
Yeah, okay, okay.
well, you know, you asked.
that's what was on my mind.
maybe carl will nd a girl who enjoys what he does.
so. so that. that's the answer?
my job has no point?
freaks should just be with other freaks?
are you talking about us?
about me?
no.
no.
uh, sister virginia's doing better.
she, uh.
her pressure has normalized since last time.
father, we'd like to test you for typhoid.
me? I feel fine.
carriers are asymptomatic.
you wouldn't know you had it until it spread.
well, I've done missionary work all over the world, but that was years ago.
that doesn't matter. This disease can stay dormant for years.
you think.
you think sister virginia got it from me?
I know you say you don't go in the convent, but.
if you had direct contact with her.
I would sneak in at night, and we.
no, you don't have to say.
I would sneak in, and we would.
cook.
cook?
I couldn't boil water before she arrived. Never had to.
but then I would see her, and she was just so graceful and smart.
when no one else was around, I would ask her for pointers.
it's been years now.
and we have never touched.
I know it was forbidden.
she'd be away on missions, and I'd just.
part of me was always waiting.
for the next time you could be together.
I missed my friend.
all this pain because of me, I just.
Oh, no, no. You. you couldn't have known.
we'll get you on a course of antibiotics, you'll be fine.
thank you.
we all make choices.
the two of you made a choice.
I know. I was there.
and so was he.
I just want you to know that as far as, uh, we're concerned.
you will always be married.
Darcy, are you okay?
you're the doctor who. you took the baby?
ma'am, we were offering your daughter a safe option.
it's called safe surrender.
she's actually protecting herself and the baby.
she made the right choice to call. It was the brave choice.
you think we'd ever let her give this baby away?
my god. This is my grandchild.
I didn't even notice.
I-is she okay?
she's a very healthy baby. Here you go.
got her? Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
her name is melanie.
my daughter's name is melanie.
that's a perfect name.
father mark said we're still married in the eyes of god, so technically, what we did the other night, not a sin.
Oh, really?
Yeah, that's what the father said.
which means if we were to do it again.
I'm going home, Dr. Freedman.
come have a drink with me.
what?
no.
come on.
I am not having sex with you just because I wrote some things on the internet.
no.
a drink. Not sex. Absolutely no sex.
I could get you that drink now.
not yet.
ask me again in two hours.
ahh, yes, ma'am.
you heading out?
I don't think I can be in this day.
any longer.
you shouldn't be alone tonight.
I won't be.
I'm sorry. I know it's past neighbor time.
come in. It's cold.
uh, can I get you anything? Some tea or wine?
wine.
I called naomi, but, uh.
no one answered.
you want to talk about it?
it was, um.
a night, you know?
just a night.
and, uh.
then I c-called naomi, and she wasn't home, and I-I just couldn't.
go home yet.
Hey.
you've been downgraded to acquaintance. I'm moving on.
|| I was wondering if you would be interested in having a drink with me.
what we did the other night? Not a sin.
you do a lot for the practice.
but I do it for you.
I am not having sex with you just because I wrote some things on the internet.
thank you so much.
uh, uh, pete helped.
they saved a marriage.
it's not erupting.
it'll erupt. Just wait.
it's not erupting.
just wait.
it's not erupting. -Told you.
why didn't your daughter do her own science project?
because when maya's happy, naomi's happy.
I thought the point of getting divorced is you stop being the keeper of your ex-Wife's happiness.
Yeah, right.
are you trying to get back in naomi's pants?
n-no. I am not.
her pants are her pants.
do not sleep with naomi.
I am. Why?
office drama. We don't need any more office drama.
just because you couldn't seal the deal with addison and you couldn't seal the deal with viot.
I seal the deal.
okay, i. Seal the deal.
not that i'm sealing anything with naomi,'cause i'm not sealing. With naomi.
casual sex with virtual strangers, that's the way to go.
Yeah, how's that working out for you?
actually, it's working out just fine. I gotta go.
w-wait. -Gotta go.

I'm gonna go talk to pete right now.
Where's the honey?
all we have is this artificial sweetener crap.
food should weigh more than this.
can we.
I've been thinking about things between us.
Yeah. They've been weird.
just because we were bad at the dating thing doesn't mean that We have to be uncomfortable around each other.
I think that we should be friends.
friends?
Yeah. I hear grown-Ups do it all the time.
done.
so.
Oh, no. We don't have to start right now.
good.
Hey, my officis freezing.
it's frozen in there.
I need my labs for my 10: 00.
all right. I'll go get them.
wait, something is off today. What is. What is off?
just because addison found out about us,
you didn't tell her, like, every little detail, did you?
and she didn't tell everybody else, right?
well, no. -Okay.
Why?
no, it's jus uh, cooper was acting like maybe he knew.
my office smells like a dead rat.
excuse me?
no one took out the trash.
what is going on today?
I'm here. I'm here.
is everything all right?
Yeah, it's fine. Uh, sort of.
is ipossible you could help me with something medical?
Yeah, sure. What is it?
um, it's my pa pa. Something's wrong.
your pa pa?
please tell me that that's not what you call your.
n-no, no. -Okay.
um, my. My grandfather.
um, and his friend nate.
I think they're being abused at their nursing home.
the vaginismus. Is it recurring?
no, not at all.
once you got us going, our sex has been.
unbelievable I mean, really.
we've been doing it like crazy for the last two months.
I've peed on i don't know how many sticks.
nothing.
something's just not right.
I just know it. I'm just a mess down there.
cathleen, two mont.
I mean, it tes couples time to conceive, sometimes up to a year.
I know. I just. We really want to have a baby.
and it's not like i'm a spring chicken. It took me a long time to find geoffrey.
I just want to know that we can.
okay. I'll, uh, check your F. S.H.
and get a sample from geoffrey if that'll make you feel better.
this grandson of mine worries too much. Ever since he was a boy.
worry, worry.
no, he's just concerned about you.
do. Do you see those?
every time i go to the nursing he, there's another one.
and look. Look, look, look.
those are liver spots, kid.
you have lollipops here?
they're just for the kids.
so, uh, where are these bruises coming from?
I don't know.
he says this every time i ask.
has anyone who works at the nursing home hurt you in any way?
they wouldn't have the nerve.
I spent ten years in thearine corps, fought in korea.
I'd beat them down.
what about dementia?
what about sleepwalking? You, uh, bumping into things?
what am i, an idiot?
you are kind of a klutz. -Watch it.
or what, you'll come over here and fall on me?
look, my memory is sharp as a swiss army knife.
ask me anything from 1945 on, and i'll tell you.
okay.
your grandfather claims he's not being abused.
I'm inclined to believe him.
well, i'm not.
look, he. He would never say if something like that was happening.
what am i supposed to do, just wait around and hope i'm wrong?
dell, i'm ready. Let's go.
so long. -So long.
Dr. Montgomery.
you're, uh.
yore dry.
last time i saw you, you were all wet from the birthing tub.
yet you still recognize me.
Yes. Well, my cop-Honed powers of deduction.
I'm waiting for Dr. Bennett. I'm having him do my physical.
Oh, you're a patient here?
Yeah, i heard he delived a baby next to a slurpee machine.
he did.
so he must be good.
you are in good hands.
officer nelson?
Dr. Bennett. -Yes.
I'm sorry. Uh, Dr. Montgomery was just distracting me.
well, she often has that affect on people.
come on. Let's do this.
here's the pitch.
you and me, 2-Day intensive parenting class for new fathers.
you do your holistic baby thing. I got a list odad's that are already on board.
all we gotta do is make the call.
did you come up with this yourself? -Yes, sir.
it's time we got more aggressive and competitive with other institutions, show them who's on top.
you know what? We're guys talking to guys.
we. We can handle this. -We can totally handle it.
Cooper and i are gonna teach a parenting class to expectant dads.
you never told me about a dad's class. I could.
Oh, no, no, no. We're gonna go twosies on it, do it our way.
wait a minute, wait a minute, the insurance on that, that could cost a lot of.
it's not a problem. It's gonna bring in $20, 000 in 2 days.
everybody needs to leave cooper alone.
that's a gat idea. Godspeed.
so, so, hey.
what. What were you up to last night?
I called you, but got no answer.
Ah, I crashed early.
Hey, pete. -Hey.
have fun at your class.
have fun at your class.
I am being a friend, okay? We are doing friendship.
Yeah, i'm your friend, and you have never been that nice to me, ever.
we're adjusting, all right. Just.
whenever we give each other a hard time or we start to fight, i mean, that's when.
Yeah, that's when the two of you get hot for each other.
Yes, i know. It's twisted. But.
okay, and see that's why i don't know what to do about my cop, you know?
I mean, i think maybe he's interested,
but then maybe i shouldn't inflict myself on a decent, unsuspecting officer of the peace.
well, maybe. Maybe that's what you need.
Oh, i don't know. My track record with men lately, he's probably a crazy.
|| We checked your l. H. Levels, and they're normal.
you're ovulating.
good. That's good, right?
well, we did find some fibroids, so we should monitor them just to.
I knew it. It's always me.
first my vagina was locked, and now.
you should get your money back. I am a dud.
the fertility issue doesn't lie with you.
Geoffrey, we checked your sperm count, and unfortunately, it was very low.
h-how low?
there are no viable sperm in your specimen.
I'm sorry, geoffrey. You're sterile.
I know this isn't what you want to hear, but there is hope.
when you're ready, there are other options.
there's sperm donation, adoption.
the main thing is, you can have a child, a family.
no adoption.
wait. I don't know if we should be ruling that out.
we're going with a sperm donor.
but, honey. -No.
you've always wanted to be pregnant. You've always wanted a baby oyour own.
do we have to decide now?
is there a reason to rush?
not to rush, but, uh, fertility does decline every year for a woman after the age of 35.
and the fibroids could eventually interfere.
all ght. We get it.
we've gotta go for it now.
look, they said you're ovulating.
doesn't that mean we're in the zone to try?
that's. That's right. Yes.
are you sure you're okay with this?
cathleen, i love you.
it's what you want, what i want.
I'm sure.
so what's wrong with dell's granddad?
Oh, it's just some minor bumps and bruises.
dell's concerned that there might be some abuse going on, but nate and wendell are adamant that that's not happening.
well, dell's grandfather is a war vet.
I think he'd be too proud to admit something like that. Where's the mom?
dell's always getting those postcards from india and china and all over the place?
Yeah, i asked him once. He said that she was a rolling stone.
Yeah, she ro
Wendell went into a home after his wife died.
you sure know a lot about dell.
seriously, if dell suspects something, then maybe you should.
I just read a paper about der abuse.
it's way underreported.
all right, i'll call the nursing home, see if i can get ahold of his medical records.
Hey, sam.
tell me what that was about earlier.
I just think th it would be nice if we kept this thing private.
well, somebody already found out, sam.
and honestly, i don't think it's that big of a deal.
what, are you afraid that this is gonna mean commitment?
what? Because if, you know, you're ashamed of having s with your ex-Wife.
um, naomi, i got these labs for your patient. -Just leave it on my desk.
excuse me.
all right. Sorry. Yeah.
jeez.
they're really going at it lately. One minute, they're grinning, then the next minute they're.
you think they're "going at it"?
sex? -Yeah.
no. No. You think so?
as much as they argue?
angry sex is hot.
so i called the nursing home, and they sent over wendell and nate's medical recor.
there are a bunch of injury reports in the past few months.
minor scrapes, bruises.
so i was right to be concerned.
well, it's not proof of anything, but, yeah, you were right to be concerned.
I'm gonna go over there and check this out.
I'll go with you. -No, i can handle this, okay?
no, you brought them to me, so technically, they're my patients,
which means legally, i'm as obligated to them as anyone else.
I told you, i-I don't. -Dell, i'm going.
all right, let's start by picking up our babies.
but with two hands.
my baby looks like chucky.
do you want to trade?
no way.
all right, no trading babies.
one of the things we're trying to teach you in ||is class is how to bond with your newborn.
I don't want to bond with chucky.
these babies are gonna come into your life,
and they're gonna seem so small and fragi|| that you're gonna be afraid to touch them.
don't be.
uh, they need toe held, and they're a lot tougher than they look.
Yeah, i heard a baby can eat, like, half a cup of sand and be fine.
that's not.
and what about that baby that fell 11 stories, crawled away without a scratch?
it's what you said, man. You can't break a baby.
Yeah, you. You can.
from 11 stories, totally breakable.
um, who. Who's your pediatrician?
you know what? Why don't we start with the basics?
changing a diaper.
who wants to give it a try?
I'd like to try.
Adam. Our first volunteer. Let's do this.
Dr. Pete?
okay, gentlemen, put your babies down.
support the head. Support.
next time, support the head.
he's probably with nate or arthur. They play bingo together.
where is everybody?
we're looking for wendell. He's in room 310.
Yeah. Do you know where he is?
uh, if he's not in his room, i don't.
no, we checked his room. He's not there, okay?
aren't you supposed to be watching them?
they give me $5 an hour not to.
if you can do better.
you think that guy was just messing with us?
I should. I should've given him a 20.
you hear that?
Yeah, i hear it.
pa pa!
stay outta this. This is a championship match.
and i don't want him making excuses when i kick s butt.
first time for everything.
except you growing a pair.
come on. Get up. Is that all you got?
his heart rate's down to 30.
I can barely feel his pulse. He's hurt.
sure he is.
come on. Get up, you old geezer. Get some m||e of this.
no, no, game over. He's really hurt.
we gotta get him an ambulance. I need to get him to a hospital now.
good first day, you guys.
check your babies at the door.
guys, uh, that was amazing.
um, i was just wondering if there's any homework.
no, homework.
you know, adam, your energy is great for this class, and it's okay to be nervous.
that's totally normal for a first-time dad.
Oh, thanks, but i'm actually not a dad.
I'm just here for jack.
Jack is your partner? -Oh, no, no.
well, he's a partner at the firm, of course, but i'm just his assistant.
that's why i'm here tang the class.
Jack is your boss? -Yeah.
he sent. He sent his assistant.
well, second assistant, actually, but, uh, not for long, thanks to this class.
you need to tell him to be here.
Oh, no. No, no, i couldn't tell him that.
he'll destroy me or have me destroyed. Look, please j.
Adam, the only requirement for this dad's class is you're actually gonna be a dad,
so if your boss wants to take the class, he has to attend himself.
Hey, you're still here?
cathleen went back for one more look at the sperm donor book.
she's hoping something will click.
I'm gonna give her this baby.
I believe you. You're determined.
but. Why so determined?
cathleen never asks for much.
I promised her a happy life.
sometimes you have to get over yourself in order to do tha well,
I wonder how cathleen would feel about that.
you disregarding your own feelings to give her what she wants.
she doesn't talk about it much, but cathleen was adopted.
I mean, she's got great parents, but.
I wanted to give her what i had, you know, my family.
they're crazy, but.
it's only fair that she gets to have one person in her life that looks like her.
but what about what you want, geoffrey?
I'll tell you what, why don't you.
go home, get some sleep, think about it, and then start over tomorrow?
h-how is he?
well, he, uh, he had a heart attack.
we're trying to reopen his blocked vessels.
I did that? I-I did that to him?
well, i'm sure it didn't help that you decked him, but, uh, we can't say right now.
I don't believe this.
we. We didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.
okay, then why did you hit each other?
we had to do something.
the days there.
you-ou can't tell one from another.
me, nate.
we were all going crazy.
Yeah, well, that part's obvious.
dell, maybe your granddad, he. He just needs a minute.
I got it.
I need you to swear, okay? No more of this.
you think i don't know it's over?
old man fight club?
Yeah.
Wendell was the ringleader, too.
knocked the hell out of his friend, who's actually not doing too well now.
well, it's amazing what some people will do to entertain themselves.
Yeah. Come here.
what?
what are you doing?
I'm just entertaining myself.
and you. Trying at least.
no. -Come here.
Sam, no, no.
what? -No.
I'm not gonna be your.
secret lover.
Oh, come on, naomi.
you're mad because i'm trying to spice things up now that we're.
whatever we are?
okay, everybody around here, they already went through our divorce.
do we really have to drag them through every little detail now?
this is not about them.
this is about things being different the second time around.
if there is a second time around.
I need to know you're not just gonna give up this time.
forget it. I.
I gotta go. I-I have to get.
wait, listen. -I have a patient.
your patient's he.
Yeah, i know yeah.
Oh, uh, dell, listen, i was looking over some of these medical reports from the nursing home.
what did you do to her?
excuse me?
you heard me. What did you do?
I don't think that's any of your business.
no. It is, okay?
no, it's not.
dell, i know that you're upset about wendell.
this has nothing to do with him, okay?
every time she walks away from you, she's miserable.
and i care about how she feels, okay?
I care. -Dell.
no, i know what you think, but this isn't just a crush, okay?
maybe after so many years, you just don't see it.
you know how many women think like and.
and look like that and laugh like that and care?
one. So far i've met one.
and yeah, she's. She's out of my league in every possible way, but i don't care.
she dazzles me.
and i'm not stupid enough to hope that one day i'll meet someone like her when the time is right,
because i won't. I love her. Okay?
and i guarantee you i wouldn't make her cry.
okay, uh.
dell, i know that you're under a lot of stress right now,
so i'm gonna pretend you didn't just say those things about my wife.
ex-wife.
uh, I just wanted to let you know, I'm gonna do my job, but I'm done with Dell.
what. Hey, what happened?
dell is a.
dell's a child.
|| Sam, will you cut him a break?
Oh, you have no idea.
I'm cutting him a break.
a big damn break.
we put a lock on the basement door.
they were taking bets.
the winner would walk around all puffed up. It's.
what a thing, huh?
Hey, pa pa.
uh, the same.
the doctors put a pacemaker in.
Yoshouldn't blame yourself.
he didn't have to fight you.
I should've known better.
still no click.
Where's geoffrey? -On his way.
it's not like we haven't gone over these guys a million times.
Hey, i think i've solved our problem. I have found the perfect donor.
you.
Drmontgomery, i'd like you to meet my brother.
your brother?
Hey, yeah. Let's make a kid.
so it's true.
I had to see it for myself.
you stole my dads.
you took my class roster. I just had to refund $27, 000.
you know how that looks for the chief of staff?
see how it feels to be someone's bitch?
I see.
this is a game to you.
Oh, and it's not for you? Come on.
you know what? We're off for tonight.
game over.
I know it's a little close, but cathleen said rself, she doesn't settle.
she has her idea of what she wants.
and i'm the next best thing to being there.
are you sure you're okay with this, mark?
I mean, you'd be making a child.
I'm not having the baby.
I'm just gonna be doing the uncle thing.
it. It sounds simple now, but sometimes donations from family members can.
it gets. Be. It gets complicated.
well, mark's not complicated.
I'm not complicated.
I mean, he won't think twice about this.
you won't? -Nope.
I probably have a few kids out there i don't know about already.
it's a joke.
it's probably a joke.
this. This is good, right?
I mean, maybe not us exactly, but, uh, you know, i'll be in the mix.
Yes. It's just a little.
I-I know, and. And we don't have to at all.
it's just.
no. I want to. You're right.
you'll be in them, and that's what matters.
have you seen, uh, Dr. Montgomery?
not lately. Did you ask at reception?
Yeah.
you're back.
Yeah.
and you met, uh, pete.
my friend.
Kevin nelson. -Hi.
I came to pick up my medical report. For work.
you know, theyan just e-mail that to you.
they can kind of. E-Mail you.
okay. Uh, i thought i might see you and.
I've gotta take this. Okay.
it was nice to see you again.
please. Look, i won't be a disturbance.
and if you can, uh, just talk into the mike.
Yeah, no. Sorry, dude.
what am i supposed to tell jack? He'll fire me.
look, and after all those prenatal classes with his wife and decorating the nursery, i just.
Hey, how about i tell him something? -No, don't.
your wife is about to have a baby, jack.
so put down the blackberry, stop sending adam to do your dirty work and get over here.
got that, jackass?
okay, using a speculum, i'm going to insert a catheter into your uterus, where the sperm will be released.
mark's stuff. It was really okay?
Oh, yeah, it was excellent.
millions and millions of little guys.
so with any luck, the "stuff" will swim right to your egg, and presto.
you should have an embryo.
all right. And here we go.
No! No!
I can't.
I can't have mark inside me, this brother sperm traveling to my uterus.
I know, i know.
honestly, i love our brother, but.
he's kind of a jerk. -He kind of a jerk.
why would you even suggest this?
I'm trying here, okay? I just.
listen, both of you, this isn't right for you, and that's okay.
I don't want anybody's baby but yours.
I'm sorry.
so what do we do?
just give up, not have a kid?
I just can't do this.
I can't.
there's gotta be another way.
please.
please.
help us make our baby.
I actually thought that the brother was our solution.
no, they were right. He's a jerk.
I momentarily attracted to him, so he must be.
the sweet brother can't make babies. What does that say about natural selection?
what were his levels again?
uh, f.S. H. And prolactin were within normal limits.
how about testosterone?
borderline. Borderline low.
Yeah, but not
screw natural selection.
gentlemen, prepare to have your lives transformed.
I present to you. Diap|| b. Gone.
I'm jack grossman.
which one of you jerks called me a jackass?
that'd be me.
um, your name's jack and.
you were acting like an ass.
you don't know anything about me my wife, my work, my life, nothing.
Mr. Grossman, he w just trying to help. He.
I know that you pawned off a class that could help save your baby's life on a guy that makes you lunch reservations.
Oh, you think you're clever, huh?
I know. You're a tough guy, okay?
but the tough-guy act is not gonna work with being a father.
it's just not.
I'm doing this my way.
my wife is gonna stay home with our kid, and i'm.
okay, but your wife is not there to do your job.
you didn't check out, jack. You gotta show up.
in fact, you have gotta screw things up before you even have the first clue ab.
how many of you guys have figured out what it means to be a father?
well, i-I don't know much, but i know morthan this guy.
this kid is coming, whether you're ready for it or not.
you think i don't know that?
you think it doesn't keep me up at night?
all i want for that kid is to be safe and to be happy,
and i'm doing everything that i know how to do.
I believe you. Now do more.
I mean, you came down here to yell at a pediatrician, so don't tell me you don't care enough.
I got this.
am i, uh. I'm not fired?
no.
but there's no way you're watching me do this.
well, come on. Let's show this guy how to rock this, right? Come on.
Yeah, all right. Show him how it's done.
so did officer manly make a move?
you rely want to hear about this?
this is what friends do. Right?
no sex talk. That's off-Limits.
uh, i don't usually talk about it. I'm more of a do-It guy.
Oh, yeah. Good to know.
and the officer did not get a chance to move.
my man choices lately.
have been me? -And trk.
say yes.
it's that simple?
it's not your fault there have been misfires.
dating is a numbers game.
you get out there as much as you can and see what works.
volume dating, that's your philosophy?
my point is, most of the time, you're not gonna find a right fit.
and sometimes, it's the last person you'd think who makes you happy.
and.
Yeah, i'm out there.
good. Good advice.
for us.
I gotta go. Etake care of cathleen and geoffrey.
so we think we found something.
it's a new procedure called testicular sperm extraction.
okay, what's that? -Sperm search and rescue.
we go inside the testicle to look for a few viable sperm,
which we then implant into cathleen's eggs to make a child.
you can do that? -Yes.
we use a surgical microscope to isolate sperm-Producing tissue.
if we find even one sperm, you have a shot.
Wow. This is so friggin' cool. It's like rambo time.
i-inside my testicles?
Yes. Yeah.
I know why, why you've been avoiding me. It.
what? What?
I.
owe you an apology.
you do? -Yes!
I was stupid to think we could have unemotional sex, or attempted sex.
we. We care about each other. We're friends.
friends with benefits never works.
I was wrong.
thank you.
so it was the sex? That's why u've been avoiding me?
it was the sex.
good.
so we're good? -We're good.
good.
okay, Geoffrey, once I get inside, you might feel a slight pulling, some discomfort.
if it gets too bad, we can stop.
and then if Dr. Montgomery locates any sperm, I'll extract cathleen's eggs.
you can do this, honey.
I love you, babe.
okay, on three.
one.
two.
three.
okay.
I'm going inside, taking a look around, trying to find that.
one swimmer.
what if she doesn't find anything?
what if there's nothing there?
I love you no matter what.
what's going on?
the hospital just called.
I've. I've gotta go get, uh, wendell.
Nate's not going to make it.
no, not.
wait. What's that?
I have one? You found it?
maybe. I just need to grab this.
come on, you bastard.
sorry.
got it.
you. You did?
hold on a minute. We're checking.
Yeah. There you go.
that's my kid. -That's your kid.
Nate's right about his heart. It was shot.
it wasn't me? -No, no.
he was living on borrowed time.
I'm sorry.
I know he was your friend.
Nate lost his wife, too.
and then. He was at the home.
you want to know why we fight? I'll tell you why.
on those days, you wake up thinking, today something happens besides this.
death march.
our lives.
they change.
fair enough, we're old.
but they don't have to be over.
damn. It felt good.
to fight?
I hate bingo.
so did nate.
your grandma.
she was what i lived for.
you'll see, when you're like me, you'll wish you'd fought more your whole life.
you'll miss caring that much about anything.
I think we just made a baby.
Hey. You want to grab a bite?
I can come to your house, get a pizza, movie?
I have plans, actually.
Oh, okay.
but we're good? -We're good.
we're good.
you have a girlfriend.
what?
no. You have no idea how.
no.
Cooper, if this is why you've been avoiding me, don't.
I'm happy for you. I am.
God.
one of us has to act like a grown-up.
I'm hardly.
I still want to hang out with you. It's not a big thing.
exactly.
so don't be a freak.
right.
you're right.
go.
don't stand her up.
just relax.
give that one guy a chance to settle in.
I'm gonna be a big old lump.
thanks for everything. -Yeah.
is it too soon to feel pregnant?
maybe just a little.
just. -Taking it easy.
Bye.
I heard you did a great job in there.
Yeah.
God, those two, they make you think that it's worth slugging it out, you know,
if you can find somebody that makes you feel half that good.
thank you. For your advice earlier.
you're welcome.
who kicked your dog?
I think i'm helping some other guy win over addison.
good job.
it'd be weird to punch him out now, right?
Yeah, a little bit.
you said you weren't coming over.
and then, uh.
that's "game over"?
sex is best when you feel like you want to kill the other person.
you stole my dads. -Yeah.
and that makes me a bad guy.
Yeah, a bad, dirty cop kind of guy.
little bit. -Yeah.
so are we dating?
if.
dirty sex on a regular basis is dating, then, yeah.
okay, good.
does that mean i get to be on top?
never.
Hi, dell.
what is.
thank you.
look, i-I don't have it all together, okay?
but i'm not a kid.
I'm a man.
who loves you, who's going to fight for you.
h-have you seen addison? I need to.
okay?
I don't care. Let everybody know.
what was that?
he's fighting for her.
she's worth it.
hello. -Hi.
I am here to see officer nelson. Kevin nelson.
I'm a friend.
I'll see if i can find him.
in and out.
you gotta breathe in, too, not just out.
in. In.
okay, not--not like a vacuum cleaner.
like a normal person.
relax.
that's easy for you to say.
you're not gonna have 8 pounds of flesh and bones coming out of your
okay, I don't-- no visual.
this is visual enough for me.
the point of me staying over wasn't to wake up next to a pillow.
you can always leave.
I know, but I agree to adult sleepovers in this carnival because I get my itches scratched when the sun comes up, usually.
Charlotte, I will be...
right there.
I'm going back to the room.
if you're not there by the time I'm naked...
come on.
she's bluffing.
keep breathing.
thank you.
no Phillip today?
he couldn't get off work.
on the upside, he promises me a bigetr budg for the baby's room.
but I don't mind.
it's not his thing.
Malcolm's better at it.
one of the perks of being a nurse-- I get to fill in for my brother.
sorry I'm late.
again.
we'll talk about this later.
Hey, Malcolm.
fellow nurse man.
she fires you, we'll take our business elsewhere.
how long have you been like this, short of breath?
a week maybe.
I walk up a flight of stairs, and I feel like I need to take a nap.
since Phillip has diabes, do you think this is related?
gestational diabetes or something?
no, there's no association.
your blood sugar's fine.
let me just have you sit up.
well, maybe it's the baby weight.
I mean, look at me. I'm as wide as a hhway.
Hey, you're beautiful.
I'm gonna listen to your lungs.
deep breath.
good. Again.
what?
what is it?
dell, get an ambulance for me.
Dr. Montgomery? -I don't want you to panic, but I hear a little bit of fluid in your lungs, which could indicate a problem with your heart.
Phillip-- is he here yet?
I called him. He's on his way.
perfect.
there are 40 heart surgeons in this hospital.
I didn't know this was your case.
I just responded to the page.
so did you get a chance to look at my patient's echo?
Yes, yes.
diffuse myocardial disfunction.
see, that wall's barely moving.
my god.
both mom and baby could die.
I'll do everything I can to save them.
doctors thinks H. M.O. S are about denying health care, about how little help you can give people who are sick.
while H. M. O. S make a mint.
you're right, most doctors do think that.
I think that.
thank you.
you know how few people would say that to my face?
you--you know, you're-- you're very charming, but I'm, um, I'm just, uh-- thank you.
I--I'm having a hard time figuring out what you think I can do for you.
I mean, my--my practice is never gonna be part of an H. M.O..Not ever.
good. Neither would I.
I got out.
took the money and ran.
you proud of that?
no.
most of my life I've been a rich ass.
then over the past year, I watched my best friend die-- A. L.S.
he suffered...
a lot.
medicine failed him.
I failed him, and it changed me.
I want to start a state-of-the-art medical practice, change the way medicine works, change the way doctors work.
I'm not at liberty to discuss details, but...
I want you to run it.
Mr. White, I'm--well, I'm very flattered, -but I -it's William, and--and just hear me out.
I've done my homework, Naomi.
you are the preeminent fertility specialist in the area, you helped fund one of the first whole wellness practices, and in the past year, you've had to deal with finances and internal power struggles.
it's not even really your practice anymore.
it's--it's still my practice.
maybe, but is it what you want?
what if you had access to cutting-edge technology, to the best scientists and researchers at your fingertips?
top doctors in every specialty under one roof?
I have the best doctors now.
think bigger, Naomi.
I'm talking about, say, the guy who created the first embryonic stem cell.
I'm talking about giving full wellness care to people who can't afford it.
you set the agenda, then hire whoever you want to make it sure so you can focus on what you do -
being a doctor, making life.
you know, my ex-husband and I built our practice from the ground up.
and, leaving it, is, it's something I would never entertain.
well, entertain it now.
I'm offering you the chance to do what you've always wanted to do with no money worries.
what's the downside?
Hey, Nai. You, you free for lunch today?
Maya hit me up this morning about taking her someplace cool for summer.
I'm thinking we could, figure out our summer schedules.
no, I can't.
how about tomorrow?
you having lunch with Duncan again?
no, no. I just-- I'm busy.
is everything okay?
Yeah. Everything's great.
thank you.
okay.
I know testing urine is a crappy job, but jeez, Sam, lighten up.
what is it, another U. T.I.?
well, yeah, you do have a urinary tract infection, but you also tested positive for chlamydia.
now the good news is that it's treatable, so I'm gonna give you a prescription for sulfa for the U. T. I.
and doxycycline for the chlamydia.
now do you have any idea how you might have contracted this?
bill.
he's been cheating for a while.
I'm sorry.
how did I let my marriage come to this?
well, this is not your fault.
now if you need help in dealing with this -no, no, no. No.
I'll figure it out.
that's what I do.
I figure things out.
I always tell my students, stay focused on the problem, the answer will be clear.
I need to get away...
it sounds so easy to say, doesn't it?
well, it's tough to know when you're ready for it to be over.
well, I better pull myself together Donna, if, uh...
no, no, just--just give me the prescription. I'm gonna be okay.
okay.
big ben has a big appetite.
I'm an eating machine. -Six slices. Up here.
thank you so much. That was yummy.
sorry, ma'am.
excuse him.
somebody calls me "ma'am," I just want to choke them.
that's okay.
I've been, I've been called worse.
Lisa, this is Violet.
violet, Lisa.
nice to meet you.
how many weeks are you?
35-ish?
well, you've got the glow.
being a parent, nothing compares.
so I've heard.
I'm really looking forward to it.
see you later?
nice.
she's,
I like her.
you need help with that box?
her heart's just not working anymore?
it's called cardiomyopathy.
the heart muscle becomes inflamed.
in this case, the added pressure on Janine's heart from the baby caused it to progress rapidly.
from all the tests, it looks like it's been going on for a while.
I'm afraid that the damage is irreversible.
you didn't see this?
you've been there.
honey -you're my brother.
you're blaming me for this? -Come on, stop.
it's nobody's fault. -Janine's right.
I think we need to focus on the solution.
so what do we do?
she is going to need a new heart.
my god.
I'm gonna die.
no, that's what you're telling me.
I'm pregnant and I'm going to die.
how fast can we get a heart?
we need to notify U. N. O. S. get her on a list. It could take time.
how long can her heart hold out?
it's impossible to tell, but not for long.
pregnancy is making your heart work harder, which is why, Janine, I think that you need to consider termination.
no.
no.
Janine, at 20 weeks, the baby can't survive, and we need to relieve some of the pressure on your heart until we find a new one.
she kicks.
she kicks me.
she's alive in there.
please.
we can't take that kind of risk.
Janine, I want this baby as much as you, but we need to buy you more time.
you're not listening, Phil.
she doesn't want to lose the baby.
no, I can't lose the baby.
you have to save us both.
I'm begging you.
Hey, Bobby.
Bobby, it's Oper Co. -My body's on fire.
okay, you'ing hav a severe allergic reaction.
so we need to figure out what you've been exposed to, so where have you been, what have you been eating?
I-I don't know.
Bobby, you're gonna have to try to do better than that.
look, if you took something you weren't supposed to, you're not gonna get in any trouble, but you need to tell me.
I...
look, you need to check him for pills, check his pockets, check everything he came in here with.
draw up 125 solu-medrol and 50 of diphenhydramine.
is he gonna be okay?
I'm Bobby's teacher.
I found him.
did you see anything when you found him?
has he been taking anything?
Mrs. Keating, thank you.
is Bobby okay?
okay, he's having a severe allergic reaction to something.
we're trying to figure out what. He's in here. You should go in.
what's--what's going on?
my student, he's in there.
the sulfa you gave me, and the doxycycline,
I gave him both, and he's reacting.
you have to tell the doctor what he took.
no. Donna -you can't tell them.
you can't tell them Bobby and I are...
that I'm sleeping with one of my students.
she's not a vulture. She's not a predator.
she--she was confused.
I have no sympathy, except for the boy.
how's Bobby?
he's, you know, he's stabilized.
he's alert.
the rash is not progressing.
Stevens-Johnson syndrome?
Yeah, he reacted to the sulfa.
he's lucky.
people can't just give other people their prescriptions.
she was trying to help him.
what did he end up telling his parents?
he said that a friend gave him some pills so he could stay awake, study.
now they're just happy that he's doing better.
Bobby is a minor.
this is statutory rape.
she should not have slept with her student, all right?
absolutely not.
but he's gonna be 18 in what, like, a month?
you spoke to him. It was consensual.
I mean, he said he made the first move, but...
that does not absolve her, and it doesn't absolve you of your legal duty to report this, to protect him.
but in a few weeks, it won't be a crime.
what good is it gonna do either of them if I report this?
she's gonna lose her job, her credentials.
he's gonna end up humiliated -he'll be a rock star.
Marykay letourneau--hot.
that boy was 13 years old.
so by comparison, Sam's patient's done nothing wrong.
What--what 17 year old hasn't wanted to sleep with one of his teachers?
Donna was in a position of power, and she abused that.
why assume a 17 year old isn't mature enough to know what he wants?
because he's being forced to grow up too quickly, to--to make decisions about his life that he's just not ready to make.
think about yourself at 17.
I was mature, all right?
Heather wasn't.
but thank you, Naomi, for the free therapy.
all right, if this were Maya, and a 35-year-old male gym teacher
well, I would kill him, but that's not the...
look, I know that there's a double standard here, but it's different when it's a girl.
it--it is. -It shouldn't be.
look, I hate abuse, but I don't think that's what we're dealing with here.
Donna is not a criminal.
now as long as she doesn't see him again, that's all we want, isn't it?
even if she gets the new heart, he won't look after her.
he's not gonna take care of her.
you're talking about Phillip?
he sends me in his place.
who does that?
even now, he's in the lobby on his blackberry.
this is his baby, his wife.
he should be here for her, you know?
there still isn't a heart, but Janine is at the top of the list.
I've also got a call in to the head of U. N. O. S.
Janine's blood type "O," so am I.
it's the most common.
it shouldn't be so hard.
that works in her favor, but organ donation is a difficult process.
supply can't meet the demand.
I want to do something.
if I could give her my heart...
we're gonna find you one.
how long do janine and the baby have to find a heart before they die?
48 hours.
isn't that someone else's job?
I can't stop.
nesting.
I see mess or clutter or things out of place...
so, she seems nice.
and her kid is cute.
Yeah, I like them.
what? What's wrong?
I just-- I hate it that you're maybe carrying my baby, and I didn't tellher.
do you think you should?
you think I shouldn't?
it's just...
you're happy.
and I'm all for full disclosure, but do you think you should tell her something beforehere's anything to tell?
sorry, Peter. Were-- were you two in the middle of a...
just finishing.
are those for me?
no, for me, from a patient.
she's in love with me.
her name is Anita.
I started treating her a few months ago.
she was painfully shy.
she wanted me to help her be more assertive with a coworker she had fallen in love with.
you know, she-- she didn't know how to talk to him.
and as she realized how easy it was to talk to you, she channeled her love to you.
classic transference.
clearly.
you--you don't have to say it like that.
like what?
like a woman couldn't fall in love with me unless it was a therapeutic mistake.
I didn't say that.
I can be very charming, you know.
I know.
I was just saying that--that it happens, that it's part of the process.
are you having your own feelings?
this is not about countertransference.
I mean, granted, my love life is...
at best, complicated right now, but I just wanted to talk to a colleague,
I guess, go on record if nothing else.
but also to see if you had any...
secrets.
I hate to fail.
I think...
you won't fail.
she's--she's lucky to have you, Sheldon.
and can you really blame her?
dell, I'm going out for lunch, so if my 2: 00 gets here before I do, will you just put her in a room for me?
what else would I do?
dell, later, we're-- we're gonna have a talk.
a-and I mean a come-to-jesus talk.
you're not my mother, Naomi.
you're not even my boss.
everybody's patience is wearing thin, dell.
what?
Naomi won't push this.
I will.
leave.
take the day.
get it together, Dell.
I'd just found out about Bill's affair...
from his e-mail.
there were lots of e-mails from different women and pictures.
they were all so young.
and I was feeling old...
and insecure.
and Bobby?
he just got transfer into my class.
the way he looked at me, it just...
it just made me feel better.
he'd find reasons to stay after, and I'd help him with his homework.
when we wanted a break, we'd just start talking...
for hours.
I tried to get him to focus on girls his own age.
he kept coming back to me.
I know, but you're the adult.
you should've stopped him.
I love him.
look, I know it's wrong, but when I thought something was gonna happen to him in the hospital -
this is a crime, and we should be reporting it.
Yeah, bottom line--you-- you can't see him anymore.
if you do-- yeah, don't.
okay.
I hate heart transplants.
you're basically waiting for someone to die to save the person who you want to live.
it's horrible.
to have to sit and wait and sit-- and not be in control.
you can only do so much.
and if, you've got a baby, a baby who could die, you're content to just chalk it all up to fate?
no.
then it's on me.
exactly.
we are the ultimate narcissists.
life and death is all up to us.
no wonder so many doors are insufferable.
am I?
I think you're one of the good ones.
when they brought him in, I recognized him and I paged you.
it's Phillip, Janine's husband.
he's comatose, no corneal reflexes.
type 2 diabetic. Tox screen was negative.
what happened?
glucose was initially less than 10. Looks like an insulin overdose.
E. E.G. Shows no evidenceof any brain activity.
he's brain dead. My god.
do you think...
what?
he's an organ donor.
can I help you?
I'm fine, thank you.
I like the atmosphere-- open, frndly, comfortable.
what are you doing here?
I-I told you I was not interested.
I figured I'd check out exactly what you're holding on to.
well, that's not a very good idea, so...
because of the other Dr. Bennett?
I read his book.
don't worry. As far as he knows, I'm a patient.
I doubt he thinks that I'm trying to get you pregnant, and, you should go.
lunch tomorrow?
you are pushing.
I'm a man who knows what he wants.
aren't you popular these days?
what?
the guy you were just talking to.
no. He's just, um, he's a patient, so...
good night, Sam.
good night.
I can't...
I can't breathe.
I can't think.
what am I gonna do without Phlip?
Janine, I know this is unthinkably hard, and none of us could possibly imagine.
it--it's awful.
but I need you to focus right now.
I need you to focus on the baby that you're carrying, the baby that you and Phillip created, because if you don't do this, you both could die.
my husband is dead.
and you want me to take his heart to save myself?
to save both of you.
I can't.
how could I?
Janine, listen to me, it's hard for anyone to fathom, but the heart is a machine.
a heart is tissue that provides a hugely important function.
it is not your husband.
you're not taking from him.
he is providing for you.
it's what he'd want.
you know it is.
Phillip's death is tragic, but it's giving you a chance.
now you need to get over your fear and do this, if not for you, for the baby.
and for you.
he's my brother.
and I haven't even digested that, because...
I know that there's something more important right now.
we can't save him.
we can save you.
once the heart's out, we've got four to six hours to get it in.
Montgomery Barnes, hold it.
don't you dare touch him.
you're not removing his heart.
how is she?
um, I don't know.
you know, we need to focus on you.
we're gonna get you better.
I keep texting her.
she won't answer.
you know, I get it, Bobby. People fall for their teachers.
it wasn't like that. I didn't have, like, a crush on her or anything.
we started talking, and it was real.
I mean, have you ever talked to a teenage girl, Dr. Freedman?
it's like deciphering code.
this was a real conversation.
even so, given the age difference-- why are people so hung up on age?
you're not supposed to be here. -I know. I just...
Donna-- hey, could you give us a minute?
no, I really can't.
please.
we had a deal.
I want you to go.
Mrs. Keating?
I just wanted to make sure bobby was feeling better.
Dr. Freedman, is there a problem?
no, there's no problem. She's here to see me.
I think you need to go, Donna, now.
I never meant to hurt him.
I don't understand.
I love her.
you're sleeping with our son? -leave, now.
I'm sorry. -Now.
what?
you know the woman you met this morning-- violet--the pregnant woman?
Yeah.
we're, we're not together, but...
there's a-- a chance that it's...
my baby.
look, I-I-I like you, and I want to start things off being open.
she doesn't know who the father is?
you know, it a long story.
what are you thinking?
do you know how hard it is for a single mom to find a man who's smart and funny and...
likes kids, someone who likes me and my son, who doesn't just think he's in the way?
I like you, Peter.
this feels good and right.
so it's not the end of the world.
but I have been, and I have to protect him.
so I guess what I really need to know is, what are you thinking?
Where's your head at, Montgomery?
woman needs a heart, can't find one.
suddenly her husband drops dead.
bam, you got one.
awfully convenient.
Yes, it's very coincidental, Charlotte, and perhaps we could ponder just how coincidental it is if we had time, but we don't.
his wife is deteriorating.
she needs that heart now.
if we wait, she'll die.
insulin overdose is a well-known cause of death in diabetics.
accidental overdos or on purpose?
because this hospital will not condone suicide to provide organs or be party to destroying evidence if it wasn't an accident.
I want someone here from the M. E. S. office to collect trace evidence from the body and find me a cause of death before you touch him.
if that man was murdered, and you destroy evidence-- we don't have time, Charlotte.
well, make time.
I'm not letting a murderer get away just so you can have your heart.
you've got to go home.
I know, but I can't.
he needs me.
I need him.
no, this has got to end.
now his parents are...
what were you thinking?
I screwed up, sam.
you ever do that?
you see the train wreck and you just keep going because it makes you forget...
everything?
we all do, but you've gotta turn back.
you gotta turn back now.
Donna Keating?
Yes.
you're under arrest for statutory rape.
you have the right to remain silent.
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
he's been in there for over an hour, Charlotte.
you gotta get him outta here.
you need to wait.
he's doing his job.
her pressure's dropping.
baby's showing signs of distress.
we gotta do this now.
do you have everything you need?
I'll be done shortly.
you've taken his blood, you've taken photos, you've scoured his entire body.
can't you get the rest of what you need after we take the heart?
I'll take that as a yes.
do it.
let's go.
I'm gonna scrub in.
have himeady for incision in three minutes.
love is a bitch.
for you or for Lolita's brother?
I know this is crazy, but, I think donna really loves him.
turning into a romantic?
I've always been a romantic.
now that-- that really hurts.
that really hurts me.
you can take it.
no. I'm talking to you.
it's--it's polite. What?
okay.
who was that guy by the elevator last night?
what are you talking about?
woman, look, I was married to you for 12 years, all right?
I know when you're hiding something from me.
I mean, if you want to blow off Duncan, I'm all for it.
just don't hide it from me.
duncan and I are fine.
I thought we were good...
telling each other everything.
we're good, Sam. -All right.
we are. -We're good.
his airways are clear and there's no indication of any residual damage from the asthma attacks.
awesome.
I can go to soccer today?
rest the engines, bud.
next week, okay?
I didn't mean to put pressure on you last night.
I just--I think you're a good guy.
and you told me the truth.
I really appreciate that.
I just want this to work.
okay.
I, just came to, check up on you...
but, She really loves you.
she has dreams about me.
sex dreams?
well, yes.
I thought I was making progress.
we went over it yesterday.
but then Anita says that we've been so close for so long, she can't stand not expressing what she feels anymore.
and that it may seem crazy to me, but she wants me bad-- so damn bad.
I'm quoting her.
that's excellent, Sheldon.
now you're mocking me.
no.
no, she's saying to you what she can't say to her coworker.
you know, you have to get her to talk to him.
if she has feelings, and she doesn't tell the other person, it's a missed opportunity.
you know what, Violet?
you're good.
clearly so are you.
I'm scared.
Dr. Barnes says the heart's taking.
you can do this, Janine.
you and the baby are gonna be fine.
it's not that.
it's Malcolm.
he's been there for me.
everything I've ever needed, every time I've needed anything.
he would do anything for me.
well, why does that scare you?
I think...
I know he loves me.
but he's in love with me.
he's never done anything or said anything, just...
Phillip is gone.
and I needed a heart, and then Phillip died.
look, I don't want to think it.
I don't even want to believe it, but...
do you think malcolm killed him for me?
what are you doing here?
I didn't feel like being at the office, and, younow, I heard about Phillip.
I wanted to see how Malcolm was, and Janine.
something happen?
thinks that phillip's death-- that...
she thinks that Malcolm may have killed him.
she says that malcolm's in love with her.
well, yeah, I mean, I could've told you that part.
what, you didn't see it? -I don't know. I ...
I mean, he's good to her, but -we, he's also a nurse, so he'd know how much insulin to use.
I mean, he'd know what they'd look for, what would look normal.
we're talking about Phillip's brother.
no, we're talking about watching someone slip away, someone that you love.
William, I...
I am flattered.
I really am.
but you're asking me to orphan my baby, and I can't.
Oceanside is not just a job.
these people are my family, so...
I saw that yesterday, and while I admire it,
I have to think of my own family.
I love them, which is why I live 3, 000 miles away from them...
so they don't interfere with my life.
well, Sam's not like that.
we are,
I can tell him anything.
does he know you're here?
there's no one else on my list, Dr. Bennett.
I'll be back in two weeks to make an official offer.
I...
is everything all right?
my husband posted bail.
his parting gift.
he's done with me.
I'm sorry.
come to my office.
what?
it's Bobby.
he says he wants us to go off together, that he doesn't care about his parents, school, anything.
all he cares about is us, me.
the thought of it right now...
to escape everything?
I wish I could.
well, you know that you can't.
I love him, Sam.
he's all I have.
what's wrong with me?
nothing's wrong...
you can't help love. I get that.
but if you love Bobby, you gotta let this go.
how do I do that?
Dr. Montgomery.
how's the baby?
I just, checked their chart, and, um, they're both doing fine.
it's hard watching her go through all this pain, losing phillip, maybe the baby.
that baby means everything to her.
well, at least she has you.
is there something bothering you?
Yes, the timing of this, Phillip dying in a way that kept his heart pumping.
you think he killed himself for her?
you think I killed him?
I think there's a fine line between miracle and convenience, and I think about this pregnancy anand how I got to know Janine and you and not Phillip.
he pushed me to be there.
and you let him.
here was this wonderful, sweet woman feeling alone in her marriage.
and there's Phillip, not deserving what he had, not appreciating what he had.
but he had it.
he had her.
so I wanted something I couldn't have.
don't tell me you've never felt that way.
I loved my brother.
but he wasn't good enoh for her.
but if he's dead...
at least she's alive.
Hey, you all right?
you know, Malcolm, might have killed his other for someone that he loves.
and me?
I can't even find her, Peter.
all I know is St. Louis.
you know, heather is working for a company in St. Louis.
but I don't know who Betsey's with or where she's living or what she thinks about me.
and...
I mean, as far as she knows, her father's gone.
that's horrible, Dell.
but Heather was in a good place when she left, and she loves Betsey.
but she's my child.
you'll know. When--when Violet's baby is born, you'll know, and you...
I-I'd bet you'd do anything.
I mean, what kind of a man am i that I just sit here and watch?
just because you haven't found her yet doesn't mean you won't.
what's going on?
I want to believe it won't be a problem, that I can be there for you and ben and the baby.
Yeah, the baby has to come first.
I get that.
I can make that work.
I need to be there for both of them...
for the baby and for Violet.
okay, well...
I guess it's better you know now before anyone gets hurts.
I'd like to keep treating ben.
I don't want this to affect him.
I don't know, Peter.
you are testing Phillip's blood?
Why? I mean, the M. E. S. doing that.
I think he did it.
I think he murdered his brother, and I need evidence. I need proof.
we just pulled off the unthinkable.
I mean, two lives were almost gone, and then a heart dropped in our laps, and now they're gonna live.
it's a miracle.
you and I did it. Can't we just focus on that?
I can't.
Phillip dead. And Malcolm might get to be with Janine.
Why's he got to be a bad guy?
I mean, maybe he's just a guy who didn't get along with his brother.
you told me he was a good guy.
good people don't murder their brothers and then get to sleep with their wives.
can't they just be two people in love?
I mean, why try and tear 'em apart?
okay, noah, there are lines and rules and things that you can't do.
they shouldn't be together.
it's wrong.
autopsy results came back.
M. E. ruled it an accidental insulin overdose.
guess it all worked out.
I still think he did it.
there isn't any proof.
you kissed me back.
you're angry at me.
you say that I'm at fault.
but it isn't just that I kissed you.
it's that you kissed me back.
that's why you're angry.
thank you for letting me talk to him.
what's going on?
Bobby, honey, listen to me-- as soon as they leave.
they can't, bobby.
don't let them tell you that.
don't let them make you feel this is wrong.
I'm twice your age.
age doesn't matter, Donna. I love you.
you're 17.
and I- I was in a really bad place, and I needed you, but...
I don't love you.
you're lying.
they're making you say this.
Bobby, you have your whole life ahead of you.
and no one is saying that this isn't real, what you feel-- we both feel.
you know it.
no, I'm sorry.
Bobby, I- I know that you love her.
but sometimes the best thing to do when you love someone and it's not right is to just let go and move on.
I had no idea you were in town.
just a bit of business.
I wanted to check in and see how my practice was doing.
there were some bumps, but I'm feeling good about where things are heading.
patient bookings are strong.
good, good.
I'm glad to hear it.
that's...
all you wanted?
I'll be back in a couple of weeks.
you can bring me up to speed on everything then.
you were right.
I wasn't being honest, and,
I think maybe I should be.
you know what I think?
I think that, what we're doing...
is too hard.
we're divorced, but I still care about you.
and hearing about everybody you're dating and what you're doing, it's just...
it's not good, for either of us.
you--you said you could handle it.
I mean, I- I thought we were friends.
I know, I did, and we are, but I...
when your dating pool is everybody that I know -
archer, Bryce, Duncan-- there's a limit, Nai.
and maybe I said I could handle it, but I can't and--and I shouldn't have to.
so what are you saying?
we can't be friends anymore.
I need some distance, to let go, to-- to move on.
you want distance.
I need it.
don't you?
Yeah.
all right.
Sheldon. What happened?
Anita thought I was gonna confess my love.
when I insisted her feelings were misplaced, she-- she beat me with the roses.
it was great. -It was great?
I forced her, I pushed her, to a breakthrough, Violet.
and--and when she saw what she did to me, she broke down.
she realized she spent so much money on gifts for the wrong person.
she called her coworker from the office, and th-they're having dinner.
you should feel so proud, Sheldon.
you know, you--you gotta put something on that.
but that's not the best part.
the best part is I-I had a breakthrough of my own.
and I realized that when someone has feelings and doesn't let the other person know, that's a-- that's a missed opportunity.
but It isn't that what I said before?
Yes, and I convinced Anita, but then I realized that it-- it applied to me.
I'm in love with you, Violet, from the first time we rode on that elevator.
I don't care whose child you're carrying.
I can talk to you about anything.
I want to talk to you about everything.
and--and--and when I'm not with you...
I'm empty.
will you marry me?
the last time I lived with a man?
uh, it was with Derek in a trailer in the woods, way... Deep in the woods, like...
like with woodland creatures.
okay?
the shower was about the size of a toilet, and I got poison ivy on my...
Yeah, I got poison ivy.
Yeah, it was a...
failed... Experiment in pushing my own boundaries.
I'm proud of that chapter.
I got poison ivy and...
you know, I lost.
but I really fought.
are you afraid now to lose again?
Wow. - Oh, that's good stuff.
Ah, jeez.
I like living together.
I like it, too.
all right. Come here.
no, sam. - What?
we have to go to work now.- Ugh. Come on.
I'm the boss now.
no, you ain't the boss of me.
you... - I am, too.
no, hey. - I'm the boss. Now.
wait. M... Okay. - Come on.
we have a business to run. - Wait. Where you going?
Sam. Ahh!
I got you. - I have to go to work.
Mm. - What are you doing?
you are not the boss in here.
Oh, okay.
I like...
I like not being the boss in here.
huh. Looks like Amelia's housewarming party's.
tell us why you'd like to work for oceanside wellness group.
I saw the posting, and to be frank, I'm a little surprised to see you guys are still open, you know, given all the bad press with the medical board.
well, those accusations have been somewhat exaggerated.
Somewhat?
either they're investigating you or they're not.
okay, well, would you consider yourself a team player?
team player?
I'm not a big fan of sports, if that's what you're asking.
can you tell us why you decided to become a doctor?
well, back then, we called it a career path.
uh, you had a choice... Lawyer, doctor, or dentist.
who wants to have their hands in someone's mouth?
your resume is a bit confusing.
what year did you graduate from medical school?
2006. Fast-tracked it in 3.
my endocrinology residency, did it in four.
this is really good coffee. Do you guys make this in-house or send out?
uh, that's in-house. - That's good.
that's a perk. I like perks.
what's the parking sitch? I hate dings.
anyone here golf?
we'll be in touch.
thanks for coming in.
we'll get back to you.
they can't all be that bad.
huh. You wouldn't think so.
one guys asked if he could bring his cat to work.
he sounds like a keeper.
I feel optimistic.
you know, we've got a lot more people to interview. We'll find someone.
good morning, beautiful people. - Uh-oh. Look who's here.
Hey. - Well, isn't this a nice surprise?
you're looking well. - And feeling well.
I'm ready to go back to work.
uh, no caffeine, Pete. Stick with the decaf.
I thought we agreed it was a little early.
Oh, well, what can I say? I am sick of daytime television.
quadruple bypass is no joke, Pete.
you sound just like Violet. She's right.
thank you.
well, maybe you give it another week.
I'll ease into it.
uh, okay. Well, as long as you stick to the agreed upon rehab protocol.
you know, that graft site is still healing.
you don't want to stress the suture line.
just don't overexert yourself. Got it?
got it. - Okay.
are... Are you already interviewing for Naomi's job?
Oh, well, empty office doesn't bring money in.
d - don't worry. We haven't found anybody yet.
no, no, it's not that. I just thought, maybe I could help with the hiring.
I'm... I'm... I know I am not seeing patients yet, but I don't know, if you need somebody to vet the resumes or do a psych breakdown or...
you know, Lucas is with the babysitter, and I'd kinda rather be here than at home.
I don't have a problem with it.
you've been suspended from seeing patients, but it doesn't mean you can't help out around here.
enjoy. - Thanks.
great. - Great.
you're late, Dr. Freedman.
you try sneaking a 32-inch television past the nurses' station.
popcorn is for later.
what are we watching?
no, wait. Let me guess. Uh... the little mermaid.
we watched that already.
cartoons was last month's theme.
this month, it's all about the musical.
right? So tonight's feature...
you can tell 'em.
Oliver! It's a musical with real live people.
and starving, begging orphans. It's very uplifting.
Dr. Freedman, here are the labs. - Thank you.
I am going to talk to your folks outside, okay?
do not eat my popcorn.
these are the results from Kerri's last blood smear.
it's not good, is it?
I knew it. There's no weight gain.
her face is still so pale. - Let him speak.
her leukemia's back.
but... You said my bone marrow was a good match.
it is. Um...
sometimes a good match just doesn't work.
okay.
so what are our options?
there's only one. It's a cord blood transfusion, and... Quickly.
when Kerri was born, we...
money was tight.
we weren't sure we'd ever need it.
that wouldn't help.
the genetic marker for leukemia is already in Kerri's blood, so we need the cord blood from another child who's a match.
where do we get it?
most hospitals, including st. Ambrose, have a cord blood donor bank.
we'll start looking.
you two certainly started your day off right.
and that's my cue to leave.
here. - Yeah, I got it.
see you.
he does know I'm a grown-up, right?
well, we're just not used to having neighbors with noises.
noisy neighbors who have parties at...
when did I become the nosy landlady?
scary.
but it is still your place, and that party last night was just a little housewarming.
not gonna be a weekly occurrence.
Mm-hmm, just be careful, you know, with all the partying.
I'm not drinking, if that is what you're asking.
not a drop. - Mm-hmm.
I was the happy, sober hostess last night.
Scout's honor.
I believe you. And what about that guy?
Javier? - Mm-hmm.
he's a painter.
Ooh, an artist. That's sexy.
he does houses, but you should see his six-pack.
computer won't go any faster with you hovering, Coop.
just making sure you have Kerri's information right.
I do, and if there's a cord blood match, we'll know in a second.
search again.
Cooper... - Somewhere in this country, there's gotta be a match for this little girl.
move over. Let me search.
I've checked the public donor banks. I'm sorry.
but there's no match.
check the private ones.
come on, Charlotte. You're chief of staff.
you have the authorization to do the search.
that cord blood isn't for the public.
the families are saving it in case they need it.
99% of cord blood never gets used. It just goes to waste.
and what about Kerri? She will die without this blood transfusion.
I know she's special to you.
but as chief of staff, there are a thousand Kerris out there who want me to break the rules.
I can't do that.
we have a cooperative practice.
nothing wrong with a little cooperation.
so that would work for you.
I can make anything work with the right people.
okay, then. Thank you... For coming in.
you have our number.
who's next?
Dr. Jake Reilly. - Jake Rreilly m. d.
you know what? I - I think I'm gonna, uh, sit this one out.
Why? This guy actually sounds pretty great. - Yeah.
Duke medical school, time at johns hopkins.
double board certified with a fellowship in reproductive endocrinology.
I have a lot of work to do. You guys can finish up, huh?
no, no, no. He's already here.
let's just get this over with. Sit down. Sit down. Yeah.
have we met before?
we absolutely have met before. Um...
I got it. Intramural basketball.
intramural hoops. Yes, exactly. - Basketball. Yeah.
Wow.
that's a long time. You two know each other?
Yeah, uh, undergrad at georgetown.
you guys used to kick our asses all the time.
we did. I'm sorry about that.
I played field hockey at emerson.
well, all right.
so, uh, it says here that you are double board certified in general surgery and ob-gyn.
they're fairly divergent disciplines.
what, you just couldn't choose?
not at all. Surgery is the hardest of the specialties in terms of pure skill.
I'm sure as a fellow surgeon, you would agree.
but obstetrics, it's all about caring for the patient.
and fertility in particular, it, uh...
it requires a hands-on approach in a different way.
I could do both so I did.
well, we're looking for team players, not superstars.
well, look no further, really.
I mean, I love the team approach.
in fact, I'm really happy to hear you say that you're not moving away from it.
what does that mean?
frankly, I know about your problems with the medical board.
everyone does.
I understand the instinct to hunker down and play defense, but...
you already gave them dr. Turner as a scapegoat.
you don't need to do any more.
well, unfortunately, the medical board doesn't agree.
well, that might be because they don't have every side of the story.
what do you mean?
if I were you guys, I would start to play a little offense.
okay, offense, defense.
you know, I... This is a very real threat that requires a real solution, dr. Reilly, not some sports cliches.
what I was going to say is be smart.
I mean, you're all under suspicion, right?
so take yourselves out of the process.
spend five minutes, find out...
find out who left the board most recently, because I guarantee you, they're back in the private sector and they're for hire.
so you bring them on as a consultant and you share with them all your success stories on how you guys work together, how you share patient information...
everything you're doing that's bringing the board on top of you right now.
you give them all the ammo you can find...
files, letters from patients, pictures of healthy children, anything you can find...
and then let them sell it back to their friends on the board.
everyone wins, right?
Oh, and the, uh, consultant's also going to tell you to change the name of your practice so...
you might start thinking about that now.
Oh!
I'm so sorry. You all right? - Yes.
you're Dr. Violet Turner, right?
Yes. Have we met?
uh, no, actually.
but I... I've read your book.
very impressive.
Yes, my book.
I always forget that my picture's on the cover.
well, you should be very proud of it.
I mean, it takes a lot of courage to put it all out there, and you did.
and there's no telling how many people you've helped.
thank you.
uh, Dr. Jake Reilly.
I just interviewed for a job here.
Yes. Yes, I just... I just read your resume.
equally impressive.
Oh, thanks.
maybe you can put in a good word for me.
Hey.
I know you guys are busy interviewing, but I-I just met one of the candidates out there.
Dr. Jake reilly. Wow. What a good guy.
deep thinker. It really feels like he'd be a good fit.
I'm just saying.
Hey, come on in. Have a seat.
Oh, hey, Addison. - Hmm?
come with me.
what's wrong?
I'm gone for a month, and you turn my office into a storage closet?
I've been going through this stuff all day. - I'm sorry.
half these boxes aren't even mine.
I mean, how do you expect me to see patients?
I know. I'm sorry, Pete.
violet said you weren't gonna be back for three weeks, so I...
did she also tell you that she put in shower bars because she's afraid I'll slip, or that she lays out my vitamins like I'm 10 years old, - or she checks that I'm breathing every 15 minutes? - No. W... Pete.
here, let me help you with that. - No, I can handle it.
Pete. Pete... - I can handle it.
respectfully...
I run this place now.
so if you pick these up and tear out your heart stitches and bleed all over the floor of my practice, it's gonna piss me off.
I mean, you want to come back to work early? Fine.
but don't be a complete idiot about it.
I will have these cleared out by the end of the day.
Charlotte's the chief of staff.
you can't expect her to break the rules - just because she's your wife. - Sure I can.
you know that if it was Pete asking, you would do it.
well, Pete would never ask because that would involve communicating with me.
you and Pete are not speaking?
Yes, We did at the beginning...
after the heart attack.
but no, for the last few weeks, he barely looks at me.
and then when he does, he's never smiling. - Mm.
I don't know, I'm beginning to think that his early return to work has less to do with work and more to do with getting away from me.
Yeah, probably.
Wow. - What?
I don't know. I guess I was just kind of hoping for...
don't be crazy, Violet. Your husband loves you.
of course he loves you, but he also hates you.
I mean, he's been laying on his ass for a month, totally dependent on you.
okay, so you're saying that he's emasculated by his condition and he's projecting that on me.
no, those are big shrinky words I wouldn't use.
what I'm saying is...
look... From what I hear, this morning, in front of all of his colleagues, you pulled a chair out for him, and you told him what kind of coffee he can drink.
I'm worried about him. -I know, but you gotta ease up on the florence nightingale routine, 'cause unless it comes with a naughty nurse's outfit, he's not gonna like it.
Hey. Did you find anyone good?
uh, yeah, a few, but, uh, front-runner is still Jake Reilly.
you don't like him.
no.
Yes. Jake is the fiji guy.
I mean... Almost-fiji guy.
Oh, you mean at the airport? - yes.
Wow. - Yeah, so if you can find anything on his resume that is sketchy, shady, or in any way questionable, please tell me, 'cause right now, I'm the only one in the office who doesn't like this guy...
and I'm starting to run out of excuses. - Okay.
well, uh...
he is not a member of the, uh, american society for reproductive medicine.
you're not serious. - I don't know.
Naomi used to talk about it. It's not on his resume.
it's his only shortcoming.
Really?
I'm sorry.
does Sam know?
no, and I have no intention of telling him.
we were broken up. All I did was go to the airport.
I kissed him once.
actually, more than once, but I...
did not go to fiji, and that's what counts.
you know, and Sam and I are great.
so why can't we hire him?
Dr. Freedman?
Hi, sleepyhead.
all right. You ready to watch this movie?
you okay?
I... I'm a little tired.
can we watch it tomorrow?
you sure?
okay.
I can't watch it tomorrow, but I can come Saturday.
okay. - Okay?
will I still be alive?
bingo.
I know it's a lot to digest, but Kerri does not have a lot of time.
this disease, it's like a cancer?
Yeah. It is cancer, but, um, of the blood.
Oh, she's so young.
with all due respect, dr. Freedman, what does this have to do with us?
well, when each of your boys was born, you decided to keep and store their cord blood.
and according to our database, your oldest son... Kip...
is a perfect match for Kerri.
um, the cord blood bank... It's supposed to be confidential.
who gave you permission to look at our records?
I'm gonna go shoot some hoops with Gary and Lee.
make sure you're home for dinner.
okay.
is that Kip?
that's Matt.
kip died in a car accident when he was 6.
but we've kept his cord blood in case Matt ever needs it.
Oh. I'm sorry for your loss.
um... But Matt is a teenager now.
so? - Well, at...
at his age, the odds that he would need cord blood are miniscule.
it's easy to talk about odds when you haven't lost a child.
and I can't imagine how painful that's been.
but you do have the opportunity to spare another family the grief that you've been through.
here's my chip. 30 days sober.
good for you.
so now there's no more excuses why my name keeps disappearing from the surgical rotation every week.
I'll think about it.
but you let me do Pete's surgery, and I saved his life.
I told you, it was a onetime exception.
thank you.
now it's time to get back to saving yourself.
I haven't had a drink in a month.
so you say.
what do you want me to do to prove that I'm sober, take a breathalyzer?
you want me to pee in a cup?
you cut into a patient's head after you'd been drinking.
and both that patient and Pete survived because of me.
what if the next one's not so lucky?
Wow. What's that for?
you're doing a great job.
you're not throwing around your authority.
you're not rubbing it in anyone's face.
you're just being you...
and I like it.
thank you. - Mm-hmm.
so are you just gonna stare at that coffee or you gonna pour it?
well, there's all these studies about caffeine and getting pregnant.
and I've already had two cups today, so...
I guess I'm just staring.
okay.
look, I'm gonna be...
I'm gonna be going off...
birth control, and, um, I mean, I know the odds of me getting pregnant by mistake are roughly a cajillion to 1, but I...
I'm gonna need you to start wearing condoms.
you're serious? - Yeah, look, I want to have a baby, you don't want to have a baby.
it means I can't use your sperm so, yeah.
I mean, come on, you get it, Sam.
condoms?
there's a debate happening inside my head.
you wanna hear both sides? Uh...
okay.
well, one side says that you're hiding in here because you're avoiding me personally.
and the other side says that you're hiding in here to avoid the entire world.
you know Charlotte still has me benched from surgery?
are you getting help?
are you clean and sober?
because Charlotte isn't generally unreasonable...
Charlshe's a bitch and she's a control freak and she's a turncoat.
a turncoat?
in a. a.the old-timers tell you to keep your mouth shut at work.
they tell you not to break your anonymity to anyone, especially if you are a doctor or a lawyer or a pilot or anything where anyone could use your admission of addiction against you.
they tell you to keep your mouth shut, even if you have been sober for 20 years, because people don't understand.
I didn't listen. I opened my mouth.
I opened my mouth because Charlotte needed me to open my mouth.
after her rape, she needed me.
look, one in ten people is an alcoholic or an addict.
and only one in ten of those people even tries to get help.
I have been sober for years, and I am sober again.
but do I get any credit from Charlotte? No.
because I made the mistake of helping her when she needed me and because I had a few drinks over a month ago,
I am benched... No credit, no gratitude.
so the answer to your debate, Sheldon, is everyone.
I am in here hiding from everyone.
so you're gonna feel a little bit of warmth as the medicine goes in.
that feels weird.
Yeah, it should go away in just a minute.
I'm going to get better now?
well, that is the idea.
I saw your name on the procedure list.
what are you doing?
giving Kerri a chance to live.
but where'd you get the cord blood?
Oh, a donor match came through the registry.
consent form's on your desk.
I'm glad it all worked out.
amazing, right?
there's a word for this, you know, you and I running into one another.
Yeah, the word you're looking for is "nerve."
the nerve of you coming into my practice wasting my time when clearly, you have ulterior motives.
whoa. H-hold on a second. You... You...
you think I came in for a job interview just to get you to go out with me?
it's very convenient.
actually, it is.
your practice is already affiliated with st. Ambrose, which is where I see most of my patients, not to mention, you're only a 15-minute walk from my house, so... You'll be helping me to reduce my carbon footprint.
that's rich.
look, I hate to burst your bubble over there, dr. Montgomery , but, uh, I'm a catch.
and so humble.
all I'm saying is that there are plenty of beautiful, intelligent women out there that I could be with if I wanted to be.
I mean, do you really think that I tracked you down, pretended to be interested in a job, put myself through the interview process just to get a date with you?
though I will say, having a friendly face around here is a selling point.
Oh, we are not friends.
I was talking about Sam.
Oh, it was intramural basketball.
it's not like you two climbed everest.
Hey. - Hey.
Hey. - How's it going with the hiring?
Oh, well, we found a guy we like...
amazing credentials, a great work history.
And?
and Addison doesn't like him.
well, since when does she make the final decisions?
I know there have been some changes around here, but we're still a cooperative practice, right?
officially, no.
officially, we all work for Addison and answer to Addison.
well, yeah, we agreed to that to keep the doors open.
we agreed to that for the medical board.
I mean, we had to make changes on paper. I get it.
but does that mean we don't make decisions together anymore?
because if that's what it means... - Wait. Pete, Pete, take it easy.
no, are you guys just gonna roll over and let her push us around?
it's just like with the boxes.
she doesn't respect any one of us.
someone didn't get enough sleep last night.
I don't think sleep is the issue.
well, he's had major heart surgery.
there's no way his body's 100%.
I wasn't talking about his physical health.
it's only been a month since his heart attack.
and not only is he dealing with mortality issues, but he's in emotional overload.
you know, fear, depression, guilt... They're all colliding.
well, no wonder he's so frustrated.
it's not just frustration. He's angry.
it's a typical response.
so what do we do?
cut the guy some slack, give him some space to work out his issues, and in time, he'll... He'll find his equilibrium.
Hey. - Hey. What's happening?
what's the, uh, inside scoop on the hiring situation?
still doing interviews, checking references. You know how this process works.
Yeah, don't sweat it. You'll know when you know, right?
listen...
I'm gonna go grab a beer later on with some of the doctors from the practice.
you want to join, meet a few of 'em?
sounds good. - Cool. I'll check you later.
how dare you people do this to us!
and you are? - Robert Weston.
you used my son's cord blood without my permission.
we have your signed consent.
that's not my signature.
well, there's been a misunderstanding.
I told Dr. Freedman that he couldn't use kip's cord blood.
but after he left our house,
I was concerned, so I called the hospital.
it turns out, you used it on a patient.
that is not your blood to take.
you need to believe me.
I'll deal with this and Dr. Freedman.
so will my lawyers.
Hey.
we let you into our home, listened to you plead your case, - and what did it get us? - I understand, you're upset.
and... And what I did, you have every right to think I'm a terrible person.
but if you knew Kerri, this beautiful little girl whose life you saved, you would understand why I did it.
you stole from us.
you stole the only thing that was left from our dead son.
and now you've given it away.
we can never get that back.
I was just about to call you. Look at this.
Kerri's blood count... There is no evidence of any abnormal white blood cells.
it's working. How great is that?
did you really think you'd get away with it?
Charlotte... - I checked my computer.
you used my password to access our private blood bank?
will you let me explain this...
do you realize what you've done?
I saved this little girl's life, - which is the right thing to do... - Don't you dare.
I was not gonna sit back and watch her die. - We've been through this, Cooper.
you don't get to make up the rules every time a patient needs your help.
we're all doctors. We all love our patients.
Charlotte, don't... - You broke the law and you broke my trust.
you're a doctor, and you're an adult, and you're my husband, and you didn't act like any of those things when you made this decision.
you have no self-control, and I am tired of it.
so you're a dad, huh?
good for you, Sam. - Yeah.
he's a granddad.
man, can you believe that?
what about you, any kids?
never had the time to make any.
me neither, but we love to try.
Wow. Someone's not pacing themselves.
self-control is overrated.
I'll drink to that.
I like you.
I like him.
why haven't we hired him yet?
you know why. We have to do our due diligence - to the other applicants. - Yeah, right.
you sound like a guy in the know, so what do I gotta do to get this guy on board?
well, I would start with this guy's girlfriend.
Mm. All right. That's it. You're cut off.
I have to take a leak.
Addison's your ticket.
Dr. Montgomery is your girlfriend? - Yeah.
Yeah, we don't have a nonfraternization policy at the office, so...
well, she seems great.
you're a lucky guy.
thank you. Thank you.
I've left messages for the Westons.
I'm hoping to talk to 'em before I need to bring this to the board.
Yeah, I'll keep you informed.
Oh, hey, you have a minute?
I have had it up to here with doctors playing fast and loose with the rules.
I got surgeons sticking scalpels in people's brains while drinking and doctors stealing cord blood, so unless whatever it is you have to say can change that, - now is not a good time. - I don't know anything about cord blood, but as far as one particular surgeon who drank on duty, I...
Amelia is an excellent surgeon.
her skill is not in question.
no, I know. Only her sobriety.
I'm not talking about this. - Okay, then just listen.
look, I know what Amelia did is wrong.
but you care about her, which means at some point, you're gonna have to stop punishing her and start forgiving her.
I'm the chief of staff. I can't make exceptions to the rules just because I care about someone.
I'm not saying you should, just... Do it by the book.
let her take the test, check to see if she's still drinking.
she's an addict, Sheldon.
maybe.
but if this were any other surgeon, would you be holding her to the same standard?
Hey. - Hey.
Mwah.
you're late. Boys night out must have been fun.
Yeah, I wanted to make sure Coop got home in one piece, so I had the cab drop him off first.
that drunk, huh?
uh, yeah. Yeah.
yeah? - But he had a good time, though.
I had a good time. Jake had a good time, too.
wait, Jake went?
Yeah, I invited him.
he's cool.
I think that you're wrong about him.
I know that you don't think he's a good fit for the practice, but he's a good doctor.
he's a skilled doctor.
and we all work long, hard hours, and to have someone around that everybody likes
I think is a good thing.
I know, I know that you miss Naomi.
I miss Naomi, too.
but I think that you're wrong about him.
okay. - Okay.
can we stop now, talking about Naomi and... - Sure.
Jake? - Mm-hmm.
Mm.
Mm. Did you... Did you buy some condoms?
you know I don't like to wear those.
I know, but this is not...
this is not about fashion, Sam.
okay, okay. I'll be careful.
I'll be careful. I'll be real careful.
no, no. Come on.
we're not in high school in the back of my parents' mercedes, Sam.
you know...
no glove, no love.
I'm serious.
Hey. Wow.
that's a lot of pills.
he's gonna have to take them every day for a year.
a year.
scary. The whole thing must be terrifying to both of you.
uh, it's not terrifying, Sheldon.
it's, um...
Life-altering, totally and completely.
this kind of thing changes everything.
will you talk to me about something else?
Really? Because the reason I came in here is to talk about Pete and the fact that I don't think he's ready to be back here.
you think you're saying anything that I don't know?
you think anything else occupies my mind right now except the fact that he should not be here?
okay. Something else.
U know that Sam and Addison moved in together?
and she still wants to have a baby?
well, she thinks she's gonna compartmentalize Sam and her pregnancy plans and...
okay, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Okay.
so...
so she wants to have a baby, but not with Sam, who happens to be the guy that she's living with and sleeping with, and he doesn't want to have a baby, so she's gonna have one with a sperm donor?
and she's gonna deal with i. v.f. And hormonal fluctuations, and then at the same time, she's taken over the practice, so she's gonna have to run this place and handle all of us and...
how did you let this happen?
me?
well, I was home with Pete. You couldn't have weighed in?
you couldn't have advised against this catastrophic decision that's ultimately going to affect everyone who works here?
no, this is a hazard of our trade, this thing where we always think six steps ahead.
I mean, our friends make decisions, and we're shrinks, so our brains automatically analyze those decisions and project psychologically based eventualities, most of which come true, and we... We can't control that.
but maybe we can control this or at least influence it.
the only thing we can control is whether or not we say what we're thinking to our friends.
and when we weigh in, you know what happens?
what happens is, they do what they're gonna do anyway because they're in love and because people are flawed and because human beings require pain in order to learn and grow... So you don't think there's anything that we could say to them to help them?
when you say every shrink thought that you ever had out loud, you become the "I told you so" friend.
doesn't help anybody.
excuse me.
Dr. Montgomery.
you don't want me to join the practice because Sam is your boyfriend, right?
how did you... Who told you?
it doesn't matter.
did...
did you say any...
no, I didn't say anything about fiji.
thank you.
and just so you know, when you invited me, Sam and I, we were... We were broken up.
just forget it, okay? That... That whole thing.
that whole thing? This is awkward for me.
you have to understand that.
I'm not using you as a fertility doctor despite the fact that you're the best in the city.
that should tell you something.
Addison, believe me when I say this...
I like your practice and the people in it, and that's all.
and if you hire me, I will never, ever hit on you.
I won't even look your way.
Oh, and, uh...
I joined the american society for reproductive medicine, so you're fresh out of excuses.
it's decaf.
great.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
it's time for your meds.
how are you? - Mm. Fine.
I mean, I can see that you're physically fine, but I was just wondering, how does it feel to be back at work?
because, uh, I was talking to Sheldon... - You wanna know how I feel?
you want to know how I honestly feel?
I feel like I can't get away from you.
I feel like you're smothering me.
isn't it enough that you're my wife and my nursemaid?
you want to be my shrink? Go home, Violet.
go home and be a mother to our son, because I don't want you here!
and you don't have patients.
you don't have a license.
you have no business here, Violet.
go home!
I know it must have been difficult coming in here.
you were certainly persistent.
well, I thought it might be helpful to explain the new protocols we've put into place to prevent something like this from happening in the future.
is that supposed to make us feel better, that you worked the kinks out of the system?
R - Robert, let's just hear her out. - No.
this was a mistake.
Dr. King?
Dr. King, I-I just wanted to say thank you for everything you've done for Kerri.
uh, do you have time to see her?
well, I was showing the Westons out.
as soon as I'm done......
you're the parents.
Oh, my god.
I can't thank you enough.
what you've done for... For my family, - uh, for Kerri... - How... How is she?
she's, uh... She's getting better.
I don't even remember the last time I said that.
you know, I... I'm sure she'd love to meet you.
please. Come on.
how did you...
had nothing to do with me.
I was just walking the Westons to the elevator.
they ran into each other.
you know, the elevator's actually...
you were wrong, Cooper.
breaking into my computer, stealing that cord blood...
regardless of the outcome, you were wrong.
you better pray Matt Weston never needs that blood, because you're not god.
it's not your job to play god.
Charlotte... - I made this go away because I love you.
but if you ever screw with me again, if you ever cross me like this, I'll report you to the cops and let 'em throw your sorry ass in jail.
the fast one.
which one is faster, truck or car?
the truck go... - Truck.
Yeah.
so, um...
I - I don't know what my job is anymore.
as a doctor, your wife... I...
I don't know what my job is, but, uh, but you're right that, um, that I can't be your therapist.
so... That means that, uh, you really need to get one.
cause you were mean.
you were really mean.
and I will be your wife and I will be your nursemaid, as much as neither of us likes it, but...
I'm not gonna be your punching bag.
so...
you need someone to talk to about whatever it is you're going through.
you need help.
okay, buddy.
it's bedtime.
want me to carry you?
Night-night, daddy.
Night-night. - Night-night.
Night-night.
what is that?
a breathalyzer. Blow into it.
what?
it was your idea.
you want to be on next week's surgical rotation, right?
you're back on the schedule.
Thanks.
you know, I was gonna go to a meeting on my way home.
headed to one myself.
there's one near ocean park. If we left now, we could......
Thanks, but I'd rather go solo.
Hey, sorry I'm late. - Mm.
I picked up some dinner on the way home.
Oh, good. I'm starving.
Hey. - Hi.
um, so I hired Jake.
Really?
Yeah. I thought about it, and, uh, it's the right thing to do.
hmm. Oh, uh...
I picked those up.
Mm-hmm.
Sam. - I thought about it, and it's the right thing to do.
Oh. Do you hear that?
I don't hear a thing.
I know.
no music. - Mnh-mnh.
no party, no hot guy stumbling home.
Amelia must have had a long day.
finally, some peace and quiet for us tonight.
Mm. Mm. - Mnh-mnh.
I cheated on Derek.
that's why he moved to the woods.
I slept with his best friend, he caught us, he physically removed me from our apartment in Manhattan...
and he moved to the woods.
but I didn't cheat on Sam.
no, I met Jake when Sam and I were broken up.
so there's nothing to confess. There's no reason to be scared.
I don't want to lose Sam, but...
no, I'm not scared.
I'm...
Wow.
okay, I may be delusional, but...
I swear to god...
for the first time in a long time...
I'm happy.
no.
there's a princess who falls in love with the guard, which is, you know, inappropriate.
so, when her father, the king, finds out, he throws the guard into some kind of arena...
okay.
behind one door is a tiger that will tear him to bits, and behind the other is his lady, with whom he'd be free to live the rest of his life.
the princess is forced to sit in the stands and choose his fate.
what does she choose?
the author never tells you.
what do you think she chose?
everything looks okay, Jodi.
I thought I should check when Zach mentioned you were having some cramping.
where is Zach?
he's down the hall, talking to Dr. Wallace.
who are you?
she lives in a loop.
some days, Jodi forgets the question while she's answering it.
but she does remember events and people prior to the car accident, though, right?
Yes.
but she can't form new memories.
most of the time, she bears no resemblance to the woman I married.
I am Dr. Montgomery, your OB-GYN, and I'm taking care of you and your baby.
I'm pregnant?
Zach and I, we've been trying for so long.
I wish we knew Jodi was pregnant before the accident so at least she could remember that.
what helps you get through it?
when I tell her the story of how we first met...
she-- She lights up.
and for a moment, it's like she's still in there.
wait. When did I get pregnant?
almost nine months ago, but you keep forgetting because you had a car accident eight months ago, and you got hurt.
you suffered a brain injury.
who are you?
some days I wish...
that Jodi had just died in the accident.
what does that make me?
human.
how do we have a kid? I-I don't even really...
remember you.
we were hammered, and it was nine years ago.
I mean, you're sure, he's - He's, uh--Positive.
Yeah, I-I mean, maybe it could've been...
you might want to rethink calling the mother of your child a whore.
no, that's not what I meant. Okay?
so why did you...come? I mean, now.
Mason asks about his dad...A lot.
and he's older now.
I can't just distract him and hope he forgets.
I just wish you had called me when you found out you were pregnant.
why, so you could tell me to take care of it?
no.
because I wish I had known sooner.
well, you know now.
Yeah.
so...
you're a pediatrician.
Yes.
want to start with a checkup and go from there?
I...Wait. What?
I'm saying, do you want to meet your son?
I don't need a babysitter.
and I am not here to babysit you.
Sheldon is taking over my patients, and I just need to update their charts, so
you can't do that from home?
why would I do that from home?
because you don't happen to work here at the moment.
Pete, I get that you're angry.
I understand that that's a necessary phase
do not tell me how I feel.
Dr. Turner. - Hey, Jodi.
how's the pregnancy? - What pregnancy?
it was just a checkup, but we now know she's gonna have a boy.
that's amazing.
Hi, Zach. How are you?
Dr. Turner, nice to see you.
how are Jodi and the baby?
everything's great.
they're both on track for the c-section next week.
honey, you're-- You're having a baby.
we are?
Oh, my God.
Jodi, look at me.
okay, do you remember the first time we met?
you came in with all your friends.
I was your waiter.
Yeah, that's the way you smile. Let's go home. Okay?
Zach, you'll call, and we'll finish our conversation about how she'll handle the baby and breast-feeding.
Dr. Turner, would you take Jodi to the lobby, please?
Absolutely.
we don't need to talk.
what do you mean?
after Jodi gives birth, I'm taking the baby.
I'm taking the baby, and we're leaving her.
Sheldon. Did you tell Zach to leave Jodi?
who are Zach and Jodi?
Jodi is eight and a half months pregnant, with the worst case of anterograde amnesia I've ever seen, and Zach is her ass of husband who is waiting for her to give birth so he can take the baby and leave.
what did you say to my patient?
wait. You asked Sheldon to cover your cases.
doesn't that make Zach his patient?
Zach made his own decision.
I'm helping him come to terms with it.
Jodi's very sweet, but it is kind of like living with a parrot.
what? It's true.
so she's supposed to just carry the baby, deliver it, and then he just gets to take the kid and go?
that does sound pretty harsh.
Jodi won't even remember it's her kid.
that's not gonna matter to the kid.
not for a while, anyway.
a child needs a mother to bond to.
Yeah, but they don't need to be traumatized.
what about what a wife needs?
I mean, Zach can't just abandon her.
people have left for less.
he's-- He's just angry. Just a phase.
she's all alone. He has an obligation. He married her.
I love you, Addie, but you're not really gonna preach about the sanctity of marriage, are you?
rude.
what if she had cancer? You think he'd walk out then?
this is different. Cancer is often a death sentence.
Zach is living life without parole.
and there's a third life to consider here.
Sheldon, in many, many months of talking to Zach, he never once said that he wanted to leave. But now suddenly, talking to you
I'm certain Zach contemplated leaving long before today.
and I imagine he actually would've told you if you hadn't confused your own convictions with a patient's needs.
maybe he's in an angry phase, too.
Hi, Mason. I'm Dr. Freedman.
okay. I realize I can't compete with Seadra.
you don't know Pokemon. You read it off the card.
okay. Well, cover it.
let's see. Seadra HP70...Attacks...
with smokescreen and razor wing?
Yeah, see? Stick out your tongue.
stick it out.
okay.
mom says it's not allowed.
it is when the doctor asks.
so if the doctor asks me to say "crap"
Mason. - I'm just saying.
when was his last exam?
a while ago.
it's expensive without insurance.
Yeah.
Mason, I'm just gonna take a little blood.
can you, um...show me Seadra again...real quick?
it's gone.
how'd you do that?
magic?
it didn't even hurt. - Good.
cool.
so where's my card?
you should check your pocket, man.
I need you to choose. - Okay.
Yeah, it's bedding. - Bedding?
Yeah. I mean, there's your bedding, and there's my bedding, but I thought it would be nice if-- If we had our bedding.
Really?
Yeah. Actually, no. Our sheets are ratty, and there was a sale.
but I-I tried to be romantic.
Yes, I-I... - But then you had to come in...
called you on it. - And call me on it.
and that was uncool, so just choose.
fine.
green.
can't you be a little bit more enthusiastic about it?
I'm sorry. I just-- Would you leave me the minute I have a baby if I had a brain injury?
what-- What-- What's wrong with your brain?
no, not my brain. My patient's brain. I'm fixated.
wait. Did you just ask me if I was gonna leave you when you have your baby?
no, Sam. I'm not talking about us. I was-- I am...
worried about my patient. Okay?
by the way, I'm not even pregnant, so...
well, was that a-a possibility, you being pregnant?
no. I haven't started yet. - Started...
fertility drugs. Whatever. - Right.
you know, I wasn't talking about us, so...
okay. Okay.
Addison...Are you Are you worried, that I'm gonna leave you...
no. Sam, come on. I chose. Green.
get out.
okay, I am gonna tell you something that has the potential to make you angry.
but it...It...It shouldn't.
I mean, I understand why it could, but it...
it could also be great, amazing.
and I realize it's gonna change things...
just say it already.
I have a son. Mason. He's 8.
there was this woman, and we were together nine years ago.
and it was...It was one night, and...And she got pregnant.
her name is Erica Warner.
you were only together one night, and you trust this Erica because...
the minute I saw him, I knew.
I mean...He's a mini Cooper.
did you take a paternity test?
a woman shows up, tells you you're the father of her 8-year-old child, and you just take her word for it?
Cooper...You're an idiot.
I married an idiot.
I was just coming to talk to you.
and somehow I anticipated that and decided to leave.
Sheldon, I resent the implication...The very public implication...
that I cannot be impartial with my patients.
I'm sorry. I am sorry. That was rude of me.
but since we're being reasonable, why don't we discuss the public implication that
I would assert to my patient what he should or shouldn't do with regard to his marriage?
fine. I am sorry. - Thank you.
just one more thing.
did you even entertain the idea that Zach could talk to you about leaving Jodi because it's easier for him to talk to a man?
violet, I don't want to discuss this with you.
but I knew Zach and Jodi before.
they... They came to me for infertility, which, as you know, can destroy a couple.
but they never blamed one another, the never gave up on one another.
they were really, truly in love.
and you never got to see that.
I read your notes, Violet, your very sparse notes.
so that's all I had to go on.
I'm updating my notes, Sheldon.
well, that's helpful. Late, but helpful. So thank you.
well, how the hell was I supposed to know you were gonna take over my patients?
you just gotta keep on walking, Sheldon.
excuse me?
I'm saying, she's like a dog with a bone.
she won't stop, so at some point, you just gotta keep on walking.
are you okay?
he's in anger. It's a, uh...
it's a necessary phase. He'll move through it.
it can't be easy, being the target, though.
Zach's feelings are...Are cyclical, Sheldon.
he does not want to leave. - Violet...
perhaps I wasn't clear. As long as your license is suspended, Zach is not your patient. He's mine.
so imagine this scenario...
a woman shows up out of nowhere and tells a guy that he's got an 8-year-old son.
when Jodi goes into labor, what risk does her brain injury pose?
fluid may build up during delivery, increasing the pressure in her brain.
if you're asking, I should be in there with you.
What...Cooper has a kid? - What? no.
how'd you find out? - Sam texted me.
mine's from sheldon.
Cooper and his big mouth. - Oh, my god. Did you hear?
Yeah.
Cooper's gonna be a great dad.
that is a stupid thing to say.
Mason is this kid's name, and, you know, she says that he wanted to meet his, uh...Me.
I'm supposed to believe he's the only one she slept with?
so how's that gonna work?
she probably just looked up the guy she screwed, saw that Cooper was a doctor, and bingo...Names him daddy.
Cooper's a sucker.
would it really kill you to be its other mommy?
might kill the kid.
everybody just slow the hell down.
we don't even really know if this is Cooper's child.
paternity test. - Okay?
I know, but, you guys, this kid...
he's got my hair, he's got my eyes, he's got my sense of humor. It's...
you really think she'd lie to him?
Yeah, she'd lie to him.
and the other thing is...
she never forgot my name.
we did it once, nine years ago, back of her car.
once, and she remembers me. That's gotta say something.
I'm just saying.
what?
everything okay?
it's great. Everything's great.
I know it's none of my business, but...
I get it.
there's this kid that you wish would disappear, and that makes you feel guilty, and worse, he could end up being a part of your life even though he's not yours and you didn't ask for him.
you do have a choice, you know?
I made my choice, Sam, months ago.
I chose Cooper. That means taking whatever comes together...
unfortunately.
so what is he like?
he's, like, nerdy but cool, and he's smart, cute, fresh-mouthed.
he's basically me.
you do not have to worry about me.
you seem so excited, and if you...
if you took the paternity test, then you would know.
so why don't you just take it?
I have no blood relatives. And...
for the first time in my life, I look at Mason, I see...
my hair, my eyes.
I look at Mason, I see my biological son.
I get it.
I know blood doesn't matter. I mean,
I have an amazing family.
but.
you need to think he's yours just a little while longer just in case he's not.
and I know it's only been three days...
almost three days...
but it's three days sober, which is a start, right?
right.
okay. What's going on? - What?
you're keeping a secret, aren't you?
we all download to you, but just once, you need to let it out, don't you?
I want to strangle Violet.
well, you better hurry before Pete does it.
sorry. Continue.
she can't stop micromanaging and...
and telling me how to treat zach and...
and prodding me for details of the case.
well, have you told her to back off? - Yes.
and did she back off? - Yeah.
so what's the problem?
she's violet. She's not done.
Really? - Shut up.
no, I mean, you're a surgeon? People let you cut them open?
fine.
you try it.
what's so funny?
let's see. Time of death...
all right. Go. Thank you.
don't look at me like that. We were just...
forget it.
so I'm about to overstep.
you think I'm crazy for trying to compartmentalize having a baby and a relationship with Sam.
no. I wanted to talk about Zach and Jodi.
so Zach is making a mistake, and I would tell him that if the law didn't prohibit me from speaking to him, and sheldon's not gonna tell him that he's doing anything wrong.
you want me...
to convince Zach to stay with Jodi?
I used to make fun of Jodi and her lists.
even before the accident, there was a pad in every room.
now the post-its are...Helpful.
and so are you.
being here for her, loving her...It helps.
Zach, is there...
is there any way you don't have to leave completely?
I didn't sign up for this.
Yeah, but isn't that the point?
we sign up, we never know what we're gonna get, but you...
you stay, you stick it out.
you want to know what staying looks like?
Jodi...Honey, you're pregnant.
what? That's amazing. - Yeah.
but I'm leaving you, and I'm taking the baby.
you can't. I - I can't live without you. And the baby, our...
this is what it's like, dr. Montgomery, every day, over and over.
Jodi. Honey, you're pregnant.
but I'm taking the baby and I'm leaving you.
all right, Zach, stop it. - This is my life.
and I hate myself. I I hate who I've become, because living like this has made me hate her.
my wife has become my child. Doesn't that change the rules?
a normal life, and how is that possible with Jodi...
I can't take care of them both. I just...
I can't. - Okay, look, somewhere...
inside of there is the woman that you love.
I mean, you have to stop. You're hurting her.
Why? She won't remember. - Zach, I...
I I don't know what's happening.
Jodi, you're okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
who are you? - I'm Dr. Montgomery, and you're having a baby.
what the hell is happening to me?
you're having a baby, Jodi.
you don't remember because you were in an accident.
pulse pressure's widening.
Where's zach? I need zach.
Dr. Turner, where is my husband?
Zach will be here very soon.
it hurts. Why does it hurt?
you are having...A baby.
who are you?
that's Dr. Montgomery. She's gonna deliver your baby.
what baby? Where's zach?
Jodi, I need you to push.
I can't. It... It hurts. No.
I'm... I'm scared.
her heart rate's dropping. - It's a cushion reflex.
it's a sign that there's a critical rise in her i. c.p.
I want Zach!
he came to the hospital. I haven't seen him since.
did you talk to him? - Yes, I tried.
but he's made up his mind.
this is Sheldon's fault.
I'm sure he was trying to do the right thing.
okay, you know what?
I am legally blocked from talking to Zach, but you can talk to him again.
and...and the great thing about you not being a therapist is, you can say whatever the hell you want.
you... You can yell at him, you can shame him, you...
you can...You can say e - every messed up thing that you ever wanted to say to any guy who abandoned you or didn't show up for you, but get him back in here, because his wife needs him, now.
I'll get it. Okay, Jodi.
so, um, he doesn't know who you are, and I'm not ready for him to know, so you take it slow?
I will.
you're just the doctor, right?
look who I found. - Dr. Freedman.
what are you doing here?
I get junk food 'cause I let you take my blood.
well, you didn't really let me, but okay.
so what are you doing here?
I love junk food.
see, mom, he eats it and he's a doctor.
Yeah, I'm sure he doesn't do it often.
no, no, your mom's right. It's not good for you.
and I-I don't come here all the time. Just to celebrate.
and, uh, don't tell my other patients, okay?
so what flavors did you get?
I got vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.
can I have the strawberry?
strawberry's my favorite, too.
you're never gonna believe this.
you have another kid.
you know how I dip my fries in my shake, and it drives you crazy?
Mason dipped his fry, same way, except here's the thing...
it wasn't just any shake.
I bought all three major flavors.
and do you know which one he picked? Do you?
strawberry.
what kid doesn't pick chocolate or vanilla?!
my kid. That's who.
I mean, he's so my kid.
I'm gonna go to the toy store later.
Erica said Mason doesn't have a lot of toys. I don't think...
they have a lot of money, really.
what do you think?
whatever you think, Coop.
what the hell are you doing out here?
Jodi's in labor. She's scared and confused.
you think you have to tell me that?
the baby is coming now, Zach.
and Jodi, the unlucky one who suffered the brain injury and has carried your child for the last nine months, is about to deliver.
and she's not gonna understand, Zach, why it feels like her insides are being torn apart.
she's gonna be even more petrified and confused and alone.
she's not alone. You'll be there, and Dr. Turner will be there.
no, don't, Zach. She is alone, okay?
the whole hospital could be there, and she'd still be alone, because there's only one person who can make her not feel alone.
there's only one person who can calm her down, and that is you.
so if you ever loved Jodi, for the next 12 hours, be the man you promised her to be.
be there for her.
all right, and then...Then you can go.
you asked me to come. What do you want to know?
well, you can start by explaining why you didn't tell Cooper about Mason.
I was young.
I liked to party.
I was tending bar, and we did it in my car.
I know that sounds bad, but...
you think Cooper was my first?
well, a month or so later, I realized I was pregnant.
and I thought about calling.
but I was scared.
well, somehow getting knocked up's always a woman's fault.
right.
and if I did call, and he wasn't that guy, then we would've been stuck in each other's lives, and...
so why show up now?
I'm here for my son, not for me.
how much? - What?
you're protecting your son.
I'm protecting my husband.
20 grand should go a long way.
you run out, let me know.
Otherwise...Stay the hell away from us.
hook shot.
that's nice.
I still got it!
good take, good take.
it's been 20 years, you still got that weak-ass.
talk all the trash you want. I'm still up.
loser buys. You feelin' flush?
Yes, I am. - You feelin' flush?
come on.
let me ask you something. What can you tell me about women on, - fertility drugs? - Seriously?
Yeah, seriously.
I'm up to my ass in ovaries all day long, and you're asking me about i. v.f. Here?
okay, just...Just humor me.
well, it depends on the woman, you know, but, uh, it can be pretty brutal on 'em.
"brutal"? Like what? What are we talking, p.m. s. Crazy or worse?
I. v.f. Can make a woman padded-room, hide-the-belts- And-shoelaces crazy.
and, you know, it's hard to watch the woman you love go through it.
especially if you're not the one who wants a child.
you know, usually I tell the dads that, it's worth it once the baby comes. But I'm guessing that's...
that's not gonna help here, huh you buy.
that was some greeting.
no. I just...Erica's bringing Mason by. I thought...
I figured.
maybe she changed her mind.
no. Lunch was great.
and not just with me and Mason, all of us.
she is 20 minutes late. Do you think I should call or is that...
the woman never told you she was pregnant, and then shows up after almost a decade.
what would make you think she's consistent or reliable?
why would you say that?
Charlotte? - 'cause I don't trust her.
and I don't want you to get hurt.
B. p. Is dangerously high.
Jodi, Jodi, I need you to stay calm, okay? For you and for the baby.
what baby? I-I need Zach.
I'm right here.
pl-please don't leave me. - I'm not going anywhere.
Zach, I need her to push now.
okay, you hear that, honey?
you're having a baby.
you need to push. You can do this.
I I can't. I can't. It hurts. It hurts, Zach. Please.
I remember walking over to the table and being annoyed that it wasn't even my section, but I came over, and the only face I saw was yours.
I can't, Zach. Please.
look into my eyes. Look at me.
and I was trying to write down all the orders, but my hands, they were shaking so much.
and I knew then at that exact moment that I was totally and completely in love with you.
but I was too scared to ask you out.
and so you came into the restaurant every week for two months and you sat in my section.
and on the busiest night of the year, 300 reservations...
you asked me out.
pressure's coming down.
her heart rate's normalizing.
Zach, I need her to push.
okay, Jodi, honey, we are having a baby. You trust me?
Yeah. - Okay. Then you gotta push.
ready?
good, Jodi. Good.
okay, one more big push.
Dr. Montgomery, we need to give her the baby right away, before she forgets.
Jodi. Big push now.
all right? We're having a baby.
in a few seconds, you're gonna hold our baby.
you can do this. Do it for me. Okay?
come on.
good, Jodi. Good.
we did it.
our baby.
you did it. I love you so much.
what a beautiful baby.
whose baby is this?
you know, the more I think about my relationship with Violet, the more I wonder if it was ever good.
well, as someone who competed with you for Violet's affections,
I can say with certainty that this is revisionist history.
right, but she can't stop shrinking me.
she can't stop patronizing me.
she can't stop telling me what phase I'm in.
well, those are just her defense mechanisms.
she has every reason to be a little defensive these days, you know?
what are you doing here? - Jodi went into labor.
she needed a familiar face around.
I held her hand. That's all.
you're on a very thin line, Violet.
Yes. Well, since you encouraged her husband to leave her, she needed me on that thin line.
but she's not your patient, Violet. So you really have no business...
no, you have no business, okay?
you're not in this argument right now.
you are not a therapist, so you don't get an opinion.
and if you did need to have one, then why don't you take my side?
violet, I'm just saying... - You are my husband, Pete.
for one damn minute, be my husband and take my side.
who's in the anger phase now?
I know this is hard.
it's not hard, Sheldon. It's impossible.
he's not just angry. It's like...
it's like he hates me. And I...
I don't feel like it's safe to breathe.
I can't...Breathe.
what are you saying to him?
I care about you, Violet. I'm trying to help you.
but I can't break confidence, so...
so... So stop asking me.
I think it was good that you held Jodi's hand.
I... It was good of you.
I was starting to think you bailed.
Yeah, I thought about it.
well, I understand that you're trying to protect Mason, but you came to me.
I think I deserve a chance.
Yeah, I thought you deserved a chance, too, until I met your wife.
do you know what I could do for Mason with that?
I could get a car, a better place.
but I'm not a whore.
no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Erica.
you can't buy me off, Cooper.
and the fact that you sent your wife to do your dirty work so that you could be the good guy...
stop. No. I had nothing to do with this.
you have to believe me.
and I promise you, I will never hurt Mason, ever.
you better not.
I thought you were leaving.
you want to know why I couldn't come in here when Jodi was in pain?
because I knew that as soon as labor started, it would end, and when it was over, I'd have to take the baby and go.
so now you're not leaving?
I just don't know.
I love her.
maybe you were right.
no.
now I'm beginning to think I wasn't...
and I just needed a happy ending.
I thought it'd be easier to leave after he came.
but...
we made him. Jodi and I, we made him.
now I get to introduce my son to his mom.
and I get to introduce Jodi to our boy.
of course, I'll have to keep doing it, over and over.
so what are you gonna do?
I'll stay until I can't anymore.
what the hell is wrong with you?
you wrote her a check?
one of us had to be an adult here, and you couldn't, so I had to be.
Erica is a gold digger.
she gave the check back!
because she knew you'd be ready to give her everything without taking the test.
is that it?
are you jealous that Erica gave me something that you won't?
is that why you're trying to ruin this for me?
Yeah, Charlotte, you married an idiot...
a man who's excited about the idea of being a father, a man who loves kids more than anything, but who loved you enough to wait, to put it off.
Yeah, you married an idiot. I married a miserable bitch.
I'm not your therapist, Pete. I'm your friend.
and since the lines have already been blurred, I'm about to cross them.
say whatever you want.
you're being an ass to Violet.
you say your problem is, she won't stop shrinking you, but when does she stop, when she finally breaks, you...
you still just walk away.
great. So now you're on her side.
no, it's not about sides. It's about you getting that you're going to burn down the one thing you say you care about.
you're burning down Lucas' happy home.
I don't know how to stop.
I feel like I hate her.
you have a lot of rage.
and she's right that this is a necessary phase.
but you have to find a new place to direct it.
pick a new place, Pete, because Violet is flawed...
for sure, but she's not your enemy and she's not your mother, and if you drive her away, if you...
if you break Lucas' home, you...
you're on a brink, Pete.
you're at a precipice, and if you go over, I don't know if you'd ever make it back.
and you need to get a therapist.
you don't want to hear from me anymore, huh?
I do want to hear from you, but I want to be able to talk back to you like this, like a friend, because you're gonna need one of those, too.
go home to your wife, Pete.
make yourself remember the things you love about her.
I want to ask you something as a friend...
a male friend. - Okay.
I have other friends that are men, but I just feel like, given what you do, you could give me a...
male perspective on it, but also understand the female part of it, too.
am I making any sense?
sort of.
do you want to just ask me the question?
Yes, I do. No, I-I do, but...
I want to say things to you that I haven't even said to Sam, and that feels a little weird because...
I don't know anything about you.
well, if it makes it any easier, you can...
you can ask me anything.
or I can just tell you.
I am the oldest of four, three sisters.
father left when I was 9. Mother died when I was 18.
college had to wait because I didn't want to split up my family.
so I worked three jobs...
bike courier, bellman, short-order cook.
at one point, I even sold my sperm.
probably not a genius move, given Cooper's current predicament, but I did what I had to do.
I had a free ride to college, put myself through med school.
there have been a lot of women.
but I've really only been in love once.
so now you know me.
okay.
is Sam gonna leave me if I go crazy on hormones?
look, I can tell you what it's like for a man on the other end of that,
I can also tell you what it's like for a woman.
but what you're asking me is, how is Sam going to take it?
here's what I know about Sam.
he's, uh, he's fast, got a pretty decent jump shot, not a great rebounder.
and he's always seemed like a stand-up guy to me.
okay.
what you're asking, your instinct is probably going to be a better guide than any guess I could make.
thank you.
I like your haircut.
Thanks.
it's easier to handle. - I'm sure.
I'm gonna go to bed.
good night.
I did the paternity test.
you took Mason's blood, so I took your toothbrush to my lab.
you were right.
he's your son, Coop.
you're a dad.
say it.
I'm worried you'll leave me if I have a baby.
I know.
I know you are.
well, when I was younger, when I read the story,
I thought the princess chose the tiger because who would want to watch the man you love spend the rest of his life with another woman?
I mean, honestly, I've been there, and it's, uh...
it's really...
well, it's...
it is too cruel.
and now?
what do you think now?
well, now, um...
I guess I'd like to think that...
the princess pointed to...
the lady, because I'm starting...
to think that love might mean...
wanting the other person to be happy, even if that means they can't stay with you.
hello. - Do not hang up on me this time.
what, Addison? - She still won't talk to me.
hello. - Hey, so listen, just hear me out, all right?
so? -Hates me, too.
am I boring you?
I'm sorry. I'm supposed to be at a meeting.
Violet's meeting. Violet's super secret meeting to overthrow the government.
you people are odd.
now that sam's running things, he's pushing us to book more and change things, and so-- and so I don't get properly laid.
Yes, you're the victim. You're the silent victim.
you know, it's not like you've given me permission to tell Violet why I can't come to her meeting.
do not tell Violet about us. - I know.
I have to go. I'll make it up to you. What are you doing for lunch?
we don't do public.
peppone. 1: 00.
it's a symptom of the disease- it's a board with dots on it.
this practice used to be about people working together.
this board is about people looking out for themselves.
it's profit-centric. It's not patient-centric.
it's about unilateral decision making and assembly-line medicine, like--like sam's "executive physicals" and the cheetah girl temp.
she's another symptom, hormone man. - She's a cute symptom.
Naomi? - I am not in charge anymore.
let sam try it sam's way.
Sam and addison pulled off a coup.
dell's gone. We--we have to do something.
looks like we missed the secret meeting. - We weren't invited.
we did the right thing, right?
Yes, we did the right thing. We did the only thing we could do.
this is just a small storm. It will blow over.
Oh, storm's coming.
can I have my messages? -Yes.
morning, Sam Addison. - Oh, I thought you weren't talking to us.
while I am not talking to you socially, I am talking to you professionally because this is a place of business.
so morning, Sam Addison.
Hey, you guys.
morning. -Nice board, Sam.
Oh, thanks. Yeah, Dell's gone, so I'm just trying to keep track of, uh, scheduling.
Oh, I-I.
I thought it was something different. - What?
I thought that you wanted to publicly humiliate everyone who wasn't booking enough so you put your big, showy board of shame in this fish bowl for everyone to see.
no, it's--that's not. it's not a board of.
a board of shame. - It's A.
board of accomplishment. yeah.
well, you would say that. - It's a board with dots on it.
what do you mean, I would say that? -Well, you're on sam's side.
no, no, Violet. I'm on the practice's side.
wait, hey, hey.
now this board is a-- it's a useful tool. All right?
now just give it a chance. The dots, they tell me who's busy.
now if we look over here, Pete is all empty here.
I can tell that he's available to help me with the executive physicals. That's a big group deal we cut.
cash influx.
I'm sorry, but I don't have time.
the--the board would indicate otherwise.
Oh, Pete--well, you can't just make up patients, pete. - I'm not.
I made a few calls, and I'm trying something new to drum up business.
what the hell is that? - It's a cutting-edge, noninvasive cellulite reduction system.
it's a defatalator? - Good thinking.
your column's weak, Coop. - I'm on it.
do you see what this board of shame is doing?
Cooper can't even look at it.
you've forced Pete to de-fat innocent people.
noninvasive cellulite re-- if this is where this practice is headed
we're headed toward bankruptcy.
I hope this is an acceptable detour.
I can't take it. I honestly cannot take it.
don't you care? Well, you didn't even show up for the meeting.
I was doing-- I was doing something. - What?
Cooper, I just want to say that, um, if there is something that you want to tell me, but you're afraid to tell me, you could tell me anyway. I won't get mad.
we're friends. I'm your friend.
so anything you would like to not keep secret, I'm open.
I'm sorry I wasn't at the meeting.
I just--I need to stay under the radar. I don't want to be the dead weight that gets traded out for the plastic surgeon.
Hey, coop, come on. That's an excuse.
tell me.
do we have to share every detail? Do we have to be joined at the hip?
we're not 12. -Oh, glad you could clear that up for me.
I was so sure we were 12.
I know we're young, but we've been married for five years, and we've been dreaming about kids for longer.
Yeah, since junior high. - Junior high?
that's where we met.
one day I was a complete loner, and then the next day, I had lisa.
it's like looking into a mirror-- same interests, same cds, same books, movies.
we even have the same allergies.
grass and peanuts. -And peanuts, yeah.
I found my best friend.
do you know how rare that is, to find a best friend?
Yeah.
we already decorated the nursery.
we just need the baby.
please.
okay.
so you're really not going to speak to me about anything other than work?
for instance, the cop, kevin, he hasn't called.
we had a date. I thought it was a good date, and then he didn't call, which is something you and I would normally talk about.
Really? You really want to do this?
I'll take Brian. You take lisa?
fine.
I gotta thank you. My day is filled with your company's employees.
Oh, well. If anyone else had tried to sell me on executive physicals,
I would've thought it was a crock sales pitch, but I've watched you with my son for so long.
well, kirk is amazing given all that he's been through.
well, and it turns out your good business is my good business.
morale is up, productivity this quarter is through the roof, so, well, I'm glad that your employees are happy.
they love seeing you.
I wish kirk did, too. I had to drag him here today, does he need another lecture on taking his meds?
17 years old, thinks he knows better than everyone.
I hate this disease. I didn't know it could damage his lung tissue so badly.
Yeah, bronchiolitis obliterans can be brutal.
he still getting dizzy from the meds?
his breathing's getting worse, and I stay on him.
if his mother was still alive, she would know how to talk to him.
see, the more I push, the more he pushes back
Kirk? Help me get him on the table.
I need some help in here!
I need an intubation kit now.
he's not breathing. - He's in respiratory arrest.
I got Brian and Lisa's genetic tests back.
you know why they can't get pregnant? - No, but I know why they shouldn't.
what am I looking for here?
there's no marker for down syndrome, tay-sachs.
they look healthy. - Individually they are, but as a couple,
almost a quarter of their genes are the same.
they're not just husband and wife.
they're brother and sister.
is that how the defatalator works?
you lose weight by pushing it up and down the hallway?
I need Dell or an extra set of hands.
is this a unitard? - It gets 'em in the door.
it says they wanna start living a healthier lifestyle.
by melting fat?
it doesn't melt fat, Violet, but it does break it down.
and with exercise and diet, herbs
Oh, it's a quick fix, Pete. This is not us.
patients come to see us because we take care of all of them-- body, mind, soul.
Sam is paving the road to hell.
it's just a machine. - It's hamburger.
we used to give them steak. - People like hamburger.
the scring from the virus has gotten much worse, and his lung function tests show a large decline.
but you can get him through this, right, get him back home?
well, being on a ventilator will help heal his lungs.
hopefully we can get him home, but he's gonna need a lot more attention
oxygen supplementation, I.V. Meds.
well, I'll scale back at work. I don't care.
the idea of losing him, too.
I don't want this.
I told you already, I can't do it again.
don't say that. Just put this back in, now. - No, it hurts.
this is the fourth time, dad.
I can't do it.
I can't talk. I can't do anything.
Kirk, the intubation is only temporary. - I'm getting worse.
dad, the tracheotomy is next. I can't do that.
I will throw everything I have at this.
we will find something. This gives us time.
do it.
don't! - All right.
no tube, not right now. Just.
just breathe.
there we go.
I don't want this life.
not this way. Let me die.
sperm donor. - Sperm donor.
the parents used the same sperm donor. What are the chances?
well, 25 years ago, there were only a couple of fertility clinics in this town.
so everybody who was having trouble getting pregnant went to the same doctor?
and the doctors used the same batch of donors over and over again.
Yeah, it makes you think twice about messing with mother nature, huh?
I don't mess with mother nature.
I use science-- no, I wasn't say-- I.
I was just saying that-- right.
so how do we tell them? How do we tell a couple that's meant to be together that they're not?
well, everything they know is gonna be tainted-- their childhood, their families.
we have to let them know that it's not their fault.
well, it isn't. I mean, they didn't know that they were brother and sister.
and no one else needs to know.
who they tell, what the say, that's their choice.
so not only do they have to split up, they have to lie to everyone they know.
well, incest is a loaded word.
the visceral response is revulsion, ostracism.
they look like. - any other young couple in love.
and we get to be the ones to break their hearts.
you coach two little league teams. You're telling me you don't know one sick kid?
not even a cold?
Oh, okay. Gotta go. Bye.
Oh, that's your plan to get new business, cold-calling?
no.
no.
it worked for Pete.
wanna get some lunch, take a break from the madness?
I can't. I'm already booked.
with? - A friend.
I know you're lying to me. You know you're lying to me.
we both know, and yet lying.
what is wrong with you?
it's crazy, but I feel lighter already.
well, that's only step one.
to really see results, you have to stick to the exercise and diet we discussed, and the herbs.
maybe I'll just come back every day.
that seems easier.
did you get Kirk stabilized?
uh, temporarily.
when he came to, he extubated himself.
he's letting himself die. - He is dying.
maybe it's time to start thinking about hospice instead of hospital.
no. Charlie won't do that.
come on, sam. How old is kirk?
he won't be 18 until next month.
who's not 18, that new receptionist? - No, my patient.
and because the poor kid crashes a few weeks shy of his 18th birthday, you're gonna force him to indulge his father's grief and lie in bed with an intubation tube jammed down his throat?
until what, the ulcers and the hemorrhaging get so bad, he needs a trach?
no 17-year-old kid should be making life and death decisions.
he's been fighting this since he was 12. - He's done.
look, Charlie's wife died two years ago.
now you want me to fault him for wanting to buy his son just.
a little more time? -Time for kirk to live.
or for Charlie to hold on?
we're brother and sister?
my parents never even told me my father wasn't my father.
well, I'm sure they didn't think it was anything that would ever be relevant.
and for all intents and purposes, it wasn't.
this is a nightmare.
look, this is a lot to absorb. Why don't we give you a few minutes?
did you see the look on her face?
see, normally this would be the part where I'd be asking you about Kevin again, if you think I should call him even though he hasn't called me.
normally that's what we'd be doing right now if you were talking to me, nai. - Don't.
Nai-- look, I'm being an adult about this, Addison. It does not mean that I forgive you.
than you for telling us.
if there's anything that we can do.
you can help us get pregnant.
but we just told you that-- we heard what you said, but we're soul mat.
we love each other.
we're staying together.
cousins get married all the time. They have kids. Why can't we?
because your children would have a 300 times greater chance of developing a genetic disorder, which could be fatal.
what about sperm donation?
for a couple who, by law, shouldn't be married? I can't.
then we'll adopt.
the first thing an adoption agency will look at is your medical history.
they'll see your relationship and they won't-- I-- I'm sorry.
so no kids.
we just forget about kids.
as long as we can be together-- without sex?
because no birth control is 100%.
then tie my tubes. - Lisa, you're 23 years old.
just tie them so I never have to think about this again.
you were supposed to remind me about the, uh, the health fair.
Oh! Sorry. Wait.
the company that rents your ultrasound machines did call.
and they're gonna send a truck to pick them up around 1: 00.
pick them up? Did they mention why?
you haven't paid in three months. - What?
are you okay?
can you cover at the health fair please? - Uh, no.
uh, I'm working through lunch.
check the board.
Cooper, my man. Health fair-- great way to get new patients.
I, uh, I have lunch plans.
lunch plans are more important than the practice? - Really?
what web site did you find her on?
Yeah, Cooper, which web site?
I have a limit to how far you can push, Violet.
all right, cooper, grab a stethoscope, go get some damn balloons and go charm some mothers who don't know any better.
I'm, uh, hiding medical equipment.
I've been reduced to hiding medical equipment.
well, I have been asked to tie the tubes of a perfectly healthy young woman so that she can sleep with her brother. Incest trumps equipment hiding.
incest? That's--that's nasty.
so what does Naomi say?
that is a very good question, sam.
what does naomi say?
as little as possible because she is professional and courteous, and she hates me.
and I can't even talk to her about the fact that she hates me or about the practice or Kevin
or-- or Kevin? - My cop. No, S.W.A.T. actually.
um, we had a date. It was a good date, you know?
and he hasn't called and.
you're a man. Why do you guys do that?
uh, well, did you-- did you try calling him?
no. Why should I? He knows I want to talk to him.
well, he would if you-- you called him.
you suck at being Naomi.
Yeah, got that right.
what kind of a defect do you have? - I'm sorry.
I get one hour for lunch. I was halfway across town.
I ordered wine, I found a quiet corner booth, which was good, because otherwise, I might have missed your text.
I should have called. - No.
you never should have invited me to a lunch you didn't plan on attending.
I'm not looking for a relationship or love or any of that garbage, but I won't be treated like I don't matter.
please tell me you didn't just piss off Charlotte King.
Oceanside Wellness Group. - Of course not.
what was she doing here?
I don't know, but I told her I couldn't talk 'cause we're busy.
Sam, you have a call. - Just take a message, please.
um, can I take a message?
which collection agency was it this time?
it was the hospital. -The hospital?
well, why didn't you-- I'm anding.
what was it? - Some guy-- Charlie Jensen?
he wanted you to meet him there.
you gotta put the tube back in. - Kirk's right.
he's not getting any better. - Kirk's tired of being sick.
you think I don't get that?
but he doesn't see this from every angle like I do.
I know how to approach a problem.
I don't care how much money or time we have to put into this.
we're gonna fight this.
he's a teenager, sam.
he's a teenager whose life isn't over yet.
he's a month away from being 18.
you're not the only doctor in town, sam. I could take my son and my business.
you chased me hard for those executive physicals. - Are you threatening me?
you have a lot of expenses, sam. You really wanna let a huge chunk of business walk out the door?
if there was someone you loved, wouldn't you do everything to save them?
his sats are dropping. They're dangerously low.
you gotta put the tube back in. - He's just gonna pull it back out again.
then restrain him.
all right, give him 20 milligrams of etomidate and 100 of sux.
Kirk, we're gonna give you a little something to relax you, and then we're gonna have to intubate you again.
I don't-- I don't want-- all right, relax.
Hey, easy. Give me those restraints.
I'm sorry, but I have to do this. - Do you?
all right, I'm gonna need an 8-0, an E. T. Tube and a mac blade, please.
Dr. Montgomery.
I wanted to talk to you alone, without Brian.
if you get your tubes tied, you wanted a child.
no, don't.
please just hear me out.
I know what you say we are, and I know that.
this is disgusting to you-- it's not-- he's all I have.
Brian-- he's all I've ever had.
I was shy before him. I was shy and brian sees me.
he sees me and he knows me and he loves me.
my whole life, I felt like there was this missing piece of me, like I didn't fit, and Brian.
he's my missing piece, so before you say no to the surgery, consider.
just consider what you're asking of me.
you're asking me to make myself less whole, to lose a part of me.
he's my missing piece.
my best friend is my missing piece.
Hey, sam.
you make a decision about kirk?
Yeah, I reintubated him. - Against his wishes.
against his expressed wi
I did what his father-- his legal guardian-- wanted.
now kirk's underage. I had no choice.
Yes, you did. You chose to ignore your patient's wishes to keep his father happy- because keeping Charlie Jensen happy is good for business. - Pete, you're not being fair.
how much are we taking in on these physicals, sam? Enough to put his kid through hell?
I made my decision. - You made the wrong one.
I'm in charge here. Okay? Me. I am in charge.
so why don't you go back to sucking the fat out of people and making us money, and let me do what I need do to save this place?
it's a cellulite reduction system.
Pete, Pete-- no, don't.
what's the most important question, sam, what's best for the practice or what's best for the patient?
I wish I had what they have.
you-- you want to sleep with your brother? - No, that kind of devotion.
they're a team, best friends, joined at the hip. They deserve to be happy.
they are a brother and sister who want to have sex with each other.
Oh, come on. It's not like they were raised as brother and sister.
you're actually considering this? -The client wants what they want.
and so you're gonna sterilize them so they can stay incestuous?
well, stepchildren who grow up together end up marrying.
I- I think that's worse.
they're raised as brother and sister.
Yeah, well, you're a shrink, and you believe that nurture is more important than nature, but, but biology says this is wrong.
is it really ours to decide?
I mean, these people are everything to each other. I've never seen a couple so close.
because they found love, or because they're genetically similar?
um, I just heard. How did Hansel and Gretel take the news?
gretel wants her tubes tied.
you guys are actually considering this?
Uh,"they" guys, not "me" guy.
you want to sponsor inbreeding? That is gross, and, you know, I know gross.
it's not inbreeding if we do a tubal ligation.
interesting point, but as the American medical association guideline points out.
stop it! They probably tell each other everything.
they don't lie to each other.
sounds nice.
Oh, do I get a dot for the consult? - Get out.
listen, you--you cannot consider this.
kids are the one thing that they both wanted.
that and each other.
I don't think this is how Hansel and Gretel is supposed to end.
no, no, no! Wrong way.
watch out for the doctor.
uh, scrub hard. I'll talk to you soon.
lice. - No, doesn't count.
Cooper, you had those kids since they were babies. We need new business.
don't say it. - Say what?
that, uh, what, I've been chasing cases, that I'm running this place like a factory, 'cause, all right, I've been doing the best I can.
and somebody had to do something.
I was going to fix this. I just needed time.
I needed a little faith in what, whoa, whoa.
what about a little faith in us, huh, and telling us the truth?
Addison and I-- you know, when-- when did this become about you and Addison?
when you started keeping things from us.
you know, Addison didn't start this practice with you from nothing.
she didn't work Saturdays to pay the bills while you wrote your book.
she didn't have to play traffic cop and den mother while all of you got to play idealistic doctor.
I'm just trying to save what we started.
well, if we keep doing things your way, Sam, is it worth saving?
come on, Charlotte. Call me back or leave me a message or send me an obnoxious text.
we'll, uh.
sorry, yeah. Uh, leave me a message.
actually, the treatment is performed on the whole body, adapted for the skin sensitivity of each individual, so-- this place is bad enough without you trying to sell your magic beans to everyone.
I mean, does she really look like she needs help?
does that body need anything?
I mean, does any body really need its fat pulverized into submission?
violet, Violet, you know what you are?
you are A.
a- a- a judger.
you're a judgy judger who has no right to judge until she tries it for herself.
she-- she can't be.
well, she is.
violet. You really think it's her?
Oh, it's her. You really think it works?
you okay? - Yeah.
here, switch.
why would she stoop to this? She hates that thing?
I don't know w--oh, and right there, please.
and again.
is Violet defatalating?
sorry?
she better be paying.
maybe I was too judgmental. - See?
maybe I'm wrong about everything.
you're bringing in new clients, Sam has his physicals, even Cooper got some new business at that stupid health fair.
and I.
I actually think I'm getting thinner.
you don't lose weight just by w-waving the wand.
everyone who comes through that door, they don't want to talk about a healthy life plan.
all they want is magic.
this isn't magic. This is A.
this is crap.
Hey, it doesn't matter.
you don't need to lose weight. Your.
your ass looks fantastic.
I know my ass looks fantastic. But thank you for saying it, not for thinking that I don't have enough self-esteem to love my own ass..
I love my ass.
it is round and firm and, like, like, ten years younger than the rest of me.
it's a fantastic ass.
men cannot keep their hands off my ass.
stop touching my ass!
damn it, the practice is going to hell, and Cooper is lying to me, and I am sitting here encouraging you to rub fat off my ass.
life is not ass fat, and if it is, it's not ass fat that can magically disappear with a wand.
what are we gonna do?
they're here.
you know what you're gonna tell 'em?
if I tell them no, they're just gonna go to someone else.
well, I guess you'll do what you feel is best.
okay, what do you want me to say to you, that I am sorry?
because I'm not. I was trying to savehe practice. I was trying to help you.
Oh, wow. Well, thanks for helping me.
you know what? This is my practice, too.
I gave up a hell of a lot to come down here.
and I came down here for you, for you and Sam.
you went behind my back and you hurt me, and it can't be undone.
some things just can't be undone.
well, will you tie my tubes?
because if so, we thought maybe you could do it today.
we can't-- we can't take another day of this, another night.
we didn't sleep.
we just want everything back the way it was.
so will you? -Will you?
you're brother and sister.
now how can you go back to the way things were when you know you're brother and sister?
knowing doesn't change anything.
it doesn't change how we feel about one another.
it changes everything, and it can't be undone.
because we know? You're wrong.
it doesn't matter.
you think if we'd known before we got married, wouldn't have? Well, we would.
I- I don't think so.
it didn't matter to me when I found out. I still married her.
you still married me?
I- I mean-- I'm just-- I'm just saying
you knew that she was your sister?
you knew? Yo?
knew we're both allergic to grass, we have the same toes, we have the same blood type.
we're the same.
I knew there was something, and I looked into it.
but I thought.
I thought that you were my soul mate. I thought that.
y-you knew and you never told me? - Because it doesn't matter.
we found each other. Out of all the people in the world, we found each other.
Oh, don't touch me. - Nothing's changed.
don't, don't, don't! - Nothing has to change!
don't touch me! Get away from me! You--this is disgusting.
you are my brother.
I had sex with you. You took my virginity.
Lisa-- Brian, it's over.
we're best friends. - It's over, Brian.
I, um.
need you.
deal with it, Coop.
you know, there's no one else I would let do this to me.
that supposed to make me feel special? - Yes.
because the only thing you need me for anymore is picking lice outta your hair?
in monkeys, it's a sign of affection.
this sucks, Cooper.
I used to like to come to work.
I used to like to talk to you, tell you everything, vice versa.
and now it just.
it all sucks.
all you do is lie.
I'm sleeping with Charlotte King.
and I didn't tell you because.
she said I couldn't, but also because-- more because-- I was scared of what you'd think.
I'm scared of what I think because I like her.
I really like her. I might almost kind of love her.
and she's mean and she won't let me tell you about her, and she's bossy and rude and all southern twangy.
and now I got lice, which I got because I don't have any patients, which Sam never fails to point out.
and do you think Charlotte would pick lice out of my head?
Charlotte would burn me alive if I came near her with lice.
and I want to dump her so hard. I want to dump her on her ass and walk away, but the idea of dumping her gives me this pain in my stomach that makes me feel like I want to vomit, so I can't dump her because of the maybe loving her.
and it is killing me not telling you.
so I'm telling you.
I'm sleeping with Charlotte King.
thank you.
I set Lisa up with an appointment to see Violet.
Brian's staying at a hotel.
I still don't think he understands what he did wrong.
Yeah, well, in his mind, they were best friends. That was more important.
Hey, officer, uh, S.W. A.T.
it's-- it's me, Addison. Addison Forbes Montgomery.
the doctor.
uh, anyway, I,Bum.
I noticed that there were a few missed calls on my cell, and, um,
I didn't know if-- if one of them might have been you. I mean, sometimes I do that.
you know, I get the voice mail, and then I debate whether or not I should leave a message.
you know, sometimes it's just better to call back later.
but, um, anyway, if you did call, uh, I'm sorry that I didn't pick up.
but then maybe you didn't call.
I think I just lost my best friend, and, um.
I needed somebody to talk to, and you just seem like such a good guy and such a good person to talk to, and I, uh.
and I.
I now am realizing that we've only gone out once, and so why would you be the person that I'm calling?
and so now I'm just this weird person leaving a message on your voice mail.
and you don't know me, so this seems really like.
I should hang up now.
nice knowing you.
what, you need the conference room for another one of your secret meetings?
Hey, Pete.
Oh, no, no, no.
you were my one bright spot.
I'm just not a-a-a defatalator.
I-- I'll-- I'll try something new, I'll even help you with the executive physicals, but the-- C-Cooper also has something that he'd like to say.
look, I'm-- I'm a pediatrician, Sam.
kids get sick, they come to me, I take care of 'em. I don't do health fairs.
I don't cold- call patients. I don't.
shill. I'm just. I'm a doctor.
this is not how we act.
it's not who we are.
we can do better. I know we can.
I know we need money, but at the end of the day, if we can't treat patients the way they should be treated, then what'the point?
I just need a little faith.
what do you want?
I did what you asked because I had convinced myself that it was the right thing to do for Kirk.
but the truth was, I was protecting the wrong person.
this isn't about protecting me. - No, I meant me.
I was protecting myself from your threat.
and that's not the kind of doctor I am.
that's not the kind of doctor that I want to be.
you asked me if it was somebody I loved, what I would do. And.
it would kill me, Charlie, but I wouldn't want to force someone to live a way that they couldn't live with, because that would be for me and not for them.
it's the only thing keeping him alive.
but that's not the life that he wants.
we haven't done everything we can here, Sam.
I understand wanting to throw everything at a problem, Charlie.
in business, maybe you do that, an-and maybe it works, but.
you end up losing a bit of yourself along the way.
and this isn't a business, Charlie.
this is your son.
uh, no, go ahead.
you're gonna forgive me eventually, nai.
it's okay.
I'm here. It's okay.
tonight's not a good night.
I told Violet about us. She was hounding me, and I told her.
I'm sorry.
I hate you. -Yeah, I hate you, too, but you do matter.
I wouldn't have told Violet if you didn't matter.
get your clothes off.
Yeah.
I know. I mean, wow.
I didn't know older guys could be so good.
older guys? -yeah.
you're, like, the oldest guy I've ever had sex with.
a patient died today. - I'm sorry.
and I am not helping the practice.
you're doing a good job.
you're just saying that.
I'm just saying that, but it's what Naomi would've said.
I have faith in you, Sam. Things will get better.
this is just a bump in the road. Before you know it, it'll be just like-- shh.
old times.
I'm furious. - I know.
I'm gonna be furious for a very long time. - I know.
this is hate sex. - I know.
you look good.
so I had this perp, and I am running my ass off chasing him, which is not what I do, but I'm doing it because this guy, he hurt a kid.
he's scum.
and he actually shoots at me.
he fires on me. I mean, I don't get hit, but now I'm pissed.
so I keep running him down totally against protocol, but there is no way this guy is getting away from me now.
so I catch him, I grab him, I throw him to the ground. He's eing gravel.
I so want to kick his ass, but I hold it in, cuff him, 'cause I'm the good guy.
I'm the white hat.
Oh, white hat--I like that.
wait. There's, uh, there's one more.
you have a second gun...
hidden on your body?
I have a second, hidden gun.
you have a second, hidden gun.
I love you.
okay, her.
no, no, no, no. Her.
what would I say?
you're a doctor. -You're a doctor.
no. She's not right. She's not right.
you're scared? -No, I'm not afraid.
it's just-- I'm just out of practice.
okay, when-- when did you and Naomi get together, college? - Yeah, college.
how'd you pick her up? - Uh, well, she asked me out.
you got no game.
he's got no game. You never had to have game.
Hey, I have game, all right? I have all types of game.
I'm-- I'm handsome. All right?
I just... I'd like to see one of you two try.
I have a woman, but if I didn't, I could do this in my sleep.
okay, her. Right there. That blonde.
come on. Too easy.
not easy. Disturbing.
I thought that she spent her nights with her coven.
Yeah, pick a different woman, one with blood running through her veins.
where are you going?
coop? Cooper? Cooper, where are you going?
leave with me right now.
don't you dare let me out.
leave with me right now, please.
I'll do the thing with my tongue... twice.
I've gotta go. I'll call you later.
are you serious?
this banging has to stop.
fourth-floor construction got you down you know, people actually don't like to have their therapy in the midst of incessant banging.
I thought you were gonna call the construction company.
I did, and they referred me to the leasing company, who in turn referred me to the attorney.
apparently they havea legal right to carry out construction during business hours.
who is they? -Violet...
we rented the floor, they are a corporation, they need to remodel.
morning.
no, I don't want to-- what? Go ahead.
I'm not gonnaif we're not...
we are. Yeah, we are. We are.
he's perfect. He's a good guy.
he's sweet and funny and very pretty and-- and the problem is what?
he said it.
Oh, god. He said it? So fast?
I'm freaKing out. Why am I freaked out?
well, because you have trust issues. -I don't have trust issues.
you cheated on Derek. Derek cheated on you.
how could you not have trust issues?
this is not about that.
it's about what Kevin said. He said...
what is wrong with him that he would say it so soon?
maybe he actually does-- no, no, no. don't y it.
trust issues.
we've got some news.
big news.
Cooper and I took Sam to a bar last night.
since when do you go to bars? -I go to bars...
if I want. -News...
Cooper went home with Charlotte King.
tiny blonde hurricane Charlotte King? - the one and only.
C-C-C-Cooper slept with Charlotte King.
Oh, Violet, come on. I know you're mad at meabout the construction, but come on--Cooper and Charlotte?
Oh, you--you know something.
you do. You know something.
violet turner, what is it?
what, did--did he call you and give youall the juicy details?
did it go badly? Did it not go badly?
did it go well?
are they--are they gonna do it again? Have they done it before?
how many times have they done it before?
Are--oh, my god. They're dating.
morning. -You're dating Charlotte King?
I didn't say a word.
so Pete's been helping you with your holistic birth plan?
Yeah, he's been great.
I want to do everything natural, but Daniel wants to know the sex.
I want a girl. Love boys, but I want a little Laura.
this may bea little bit cold.
sorry. I'll turn this off.
you can take it, honey.
he still working too hard?
Yeah, Daniel's always working.
and he travels a lot, but he's tried to cut down since the baby.
it's not easy. We just bought a house in the valley.
and babies are expensive. -Exactly.
but whenever he's away, he always sends flowers.
roses for meand daisies for the baby.
that's the baby's name--Daisy-- which is why it needs to be a girl.
a boy named Daisy?
Daniel, you're just in time.
here we go.
see, there's a little arm...
and a lile hand.
Oh, my god. that's our baby.
so is it a boyor a girl?
looks like... a little girl.
what's wrong?
there was a subtle abnormality on your baby's ultrasound that may indicatedigeorge syndrome.
it's a genetic disorderthat can...
cause heart defects.
so if our baby has it, one of us gave it to her?
technically, yes, but-- sometimes these things just happen.
we don't always know why.
Danny--now we haven't madea definitive diagnosis, so let's just take it a step at a time and not jump to any conclusions.
let's get you down to the lab.
Franny, please, please take the pills.
Henry, good to see you. It's beeway too long.
I'm sorry I keep canceling my appointments.
it--it gets harderand harder to get away.
that's okay. I understand. Frances...
you look lovely today.
she doesn't remember much anymore.
well, alzheimer's can be very unforgiving.
hello. -Oh, the other Dr. Bennett.
Hello, Frances.
Helen, is that you?
Helen was her sister. She passed away a few years ago.
I don't need those pills.
Helen, you tell him I don't need those.
of course you don't, Franny, but why don't you take them?
let's just humor him, okay?
she's got the magic touch, your wife.
okay, let's-- let's get you started.
come on, Franny.
want to stay with Helen.
that's okay, you go ahead.
uh, Franny and I have a--a lot to talk about.
how you doing today, Miss lady?
I'm okay. -Yeah? Well, you look beautiful.
it's loud.
it's loud in here, very loud.
louder in here, quieter in the exam rooms
it's good for business, better than the other way around.
so I put a rush on Danieland Laura's lab results.
you should have something by noon, and you have a new patient at 11: 00.
thank you. -I'd like to ask...
I'd like an office so I could meet with patients and finish my midwife hours.
well, give me some time. I'll see what I can come up with.
the thing is, I'd like it now.
dell, I wish we had the space, but--actually, um, I made space.
I'll get rid of the boxes.
we will get you an office, Dell, a proper one.
I need an office now, today.
all right, if you have clientsyou need to see today, you may use my office.
we will work this out, Dell.
I don't like this.
you lost weight, you're anemic, your blood pressure's way too high. This serious.
I took all of the pills you gave me.
they'll kick in soon enough.
you can't go on like this.
now I know that thingsare difficult with Frances--every day...
I lose a little bit more of her.
she hasn't been lucid in over a year.
you know, there are other ways you can look after Frances and take care of yourself.
Oh, no, Sam. I told you. I'm not gonna put her in a nursing home.
I promised her that I wouldn't years ago. We promised each other.
circumstances were different then.
you didn't know about the alzheimer's. - Sam, I promised her.
when she dies, she dies in my arms--not with strangers, in my arms.
she's the love of my life.
I will not put the love of my life... in a home.
no, Addison, wait. -Hi, there.
thank you for seeing us so last minute.
Daniel pulled me out of class. He said we had to have an ultrasound today.
I was trying to warn you.
I have an O. B. But Daniel said you were the best.
uh, I'm sorry. Uh, miss-- this is Amy, my wife.
you have two wives?
he has two wives. Did you know that? -No.
Daniel-- I didn't plan for this to happen.
I've been happily married to Amy for 12 years.
but then three years ago, I met Laura. Fell in love.
do they know about each other? -Please. You can't say anything.
it's a pretty dumb move...
bringing two wives to the same medical practice.
when you found the abnormality, I worried Amy's doctors had missed something.
Amy's due date's right around the corner.
I couldn't risk something going wrong with her delivery, with our baby.
I should throw you out of here.
I should, but I won't.
I'll go ahead and do the ultrasound because your wife--that wife--and her unborn child are the victims here.
I'm doing it for them, not you.
let me be clear about that.
so, Amy, you're a teacher?
third grade. I love kids. I always have.
we want a big family.
and it looks like you're well on your way.
everything's okay?
you see that flickering right there? That is your baby's heartbeat.
it's so fast. -that's normal.
your baby is perfectly healthy.
thank you, Dr. Montgomer thank you.
you're welcome.
you told them about Charlotte.
I didn't. I didn't. They guessed.
and what do you care? You're the one who walked out of the bar with Cruella.
my relationship with Charlotte is mine, not yours, to share or mock or...
call Cruella.
you're the one who outed your relationship. You don't have a right to be mad at me.
I'm sorry. I had a few too many drinks and I did a spontaneous thing, and now everybody knows about it, and that's...
it makes it real.
it's very, very... very real.
well, real is a good thing, right?
Yeah, I guess.
okay, look...
it's true that I don't like Cruella-- Charlotte
but that doesn't mean...
coop, you shouldn't be afraid to hope, to want it to work out.
hoping is healthy.
real is a good thing?
real's a good thing.
we are trying to workup here!
that'll help.
it's disrupting the workplace.
I want to know who's behind it. Addison can't figure it out.
I'm gonna do it myself. You want to help me?
I wish I could, nancy drew, but I have children to heal.
fine, fine. I'll gonna find out.
Hey, Sam. -Yeah.
I am thinking we should hit a bar tonight after work... Try again.
there are so many beautiful women in L. A.
Pete, Naomi and I, we just came out of a long-term relationship.
I don't know if I'm ready to...
Sam, Cooper is dating.
well, Cooper is dating the antichrist.
well, at least he's dating.
you gotta get back out there. I am promising it my mission to get you a date.
we were just--we have to go to the hospital.
Frances just had an accint.
I was helping her out of the tub, and she fell and hit her head, and I-I tried to catch her.
relax, relax.
all right, your blood pressure's high and your pulse is irregular.
how's Franny?
everything looks good, but, uh, we'll--we'll talk to the attending before we go.
Helen... please take me home.
I want to go home.
we're gonna get you home as soon as possible.
this situationis getting dangerous for the both of you.
Oh, don't start with meagain, Sam.
did they do a C. T. scan before diagnosing her with alzheimer's?
her doctor saidshe didn't need another test.
is there something wrong?
everything's fine, Henry. It's fine.
is the husband here?
Oh, the husband just left with the other wife.
Laura, Hi. I'm Dr. Freedman. -Hi.
the baby tested positivefor digeorge syndrome.
here is some informationyouunderstand the disorder, and we can go overall of it with you.
will she... will she survive?
she'll survive delivery, but life...
for a child with digeorge syndromeis...
difficult.
digeorge syndromeis a genetic disorder, and facial abnormalities.
she's gonna require surgery-- a number of surgeries.
and she'll need a lifetime of medical treatment with round-the-clock care.
what am I supposed to do, Dr. Wilder?
parents in your situation--about half of them decide to through with the pregnancy.
the other half de--oh, god. No.
end the pregnancy?
we tried for so longto get pregnant.
it took almost a year. I...
I just... I'm not ready--I'm not ready to hear this.
I need my husband here.
for all this drilling and banging?
I try to avoid manual labor, but I am leasing the space.
for what?
I'm openinga new medical practice.
you're opening a practice here?
what about Cooper?
this has nothing to do with him. -He's your riend.
this is business, and Cooper is personal.
it's not that simple. -Maybe not for you, but I am not a therapist.
I don't have to talk about my feelings until everyone else's earsbleed.
you need to tell him. -I don't need to do anything.
if you don't do it, then I will.
fine. I'll tell him.
it's disgusting.
it's disgusting and cruel.
I mean, he is using these two women. --We have to tell them.
what our patients do outside this practice is none of our business.
Oh, come on, Pete. It's illegal.
I'm not saying I like it.
I'm saying we don't have the right to say anything to either of these women.
but if Laura does decideto have this child, she's doing sounder the mistaken beliefthat she has a loyaland committed husbandto share the burdenwith her.
I don't condoneDaniel's bavior.
but the fact that he's married to two womend oesn't mean that he's not committed to staying loyal to both of them and the children.
he is a liar, and he shouldn't-- you know...
he doesn't deserve to raise those children.
that's an emotional response, not a medical one. He's their father.
so that gives him a free pass to do whatever he wants? -You can't say anything.
don't you even think about saying a wordto either of those women, or I will personally report you to the A. M.A.
are you threatening me? -don't say a word.
fine.
I won't say a word.
didn't we talk about this?
we did.
look, I can make it work. -Why is this so urgent, Dell?
okay, you don't want to talk about it. I still don't want you using this space.
I need you to get Laura Larsonand Amy Larsonback in here again todayat theame time.
okay.
listen, uh, about Peteand this dating thing
I think Francesmight not have alzheimer'S.
normal pressure hydrocephalus?
Yeah, her C. T. scan showed no evidence of acute trauma.
but there was marked dilatation in the ventricles.
now N. P.H. and alzheimer's have similar symptoms.
okay, but what difference does it make?
her body is too frail for her to be a candidate for a neurosurgical procedure.
Yeah, but there was a study that was done about ten years agoin which a spinal tap was performed to drain the excess fluid off of patients with N. P. H.
now if she has this, the tap could relieve the symptoms and give hera few brief periods of clarity.
well, that's a big if, Naomi. -It's worth a try.
the only blessing of this disease is that she's not recognition enough to understand her own situation.
do you want her to understand how bad things are?
I nt her to understandhow bad things are for Henry.
so then you'd put her through a spinal tap?
if--if this were me, if this were you and me
this is not you and me. -I know that.
well, this is a shot in the dark, Naomi.
the Frances I knew would not have wanted this for either of them, and she's the only one who can convince Henry to do what he needs to do.
Hey, uh, Laura Larsonand Amy Larson are here.
put Amy in exam room four.
which exam room do you want to put Laura in?
let me worry about Laura.
is theresomething else wrong?
no.
uh, no. No, no. I-I...
I just want to make sure that you have all the information that you need.
uh, the room's taken. I'm so sorry. Dell must havemade a mistake.
um, do the two of you mind hanging out in here for a moment while I clear this up?
that's fine.
two new moms. I'm sure you've got a lot to talk about.
what did you do? -Nothing.
what did you do? -I did not say a word.
just get away from me!
I've got to get out of here!
what did you do?
I didn't say a word.
you got around it by a legal technicality.
exactly, because they had the right to know.
whether they did or not, you had right to orchestrate that.
I did what I would wantsomeone to do for me, Pete.
you overstepped.
what is wrong with you today?
do you have any idea what you just did?
how long did you think you could keep up this charade?
what part of my life are you calling a charade?
take it easy.
I've been with Amy since I was 21.
she's the woman I've been happily married to for 12 years.
so happily that you went outlooking for other women?
I never stopped loving Amy, but when I met Laura, it was...
I--have you ever met someone and just known there was something between you you couldn't resist, even if you tried?
I could have been one of those guys with a wife at home and a girlfriend on the side, but I married them both because I wanted to do the right thing.
you're living a lie, Daniel.
you're cheating on two women, and cheating ruins lives.
I'm not the one who ruined lives here today.
um, as the kids would say, drama.
Addison's patients? I think it's so sad.
sad but weird.
sad but fodder for the best dinner party story ever.
Addison has--she's gone crazy and...
I love it!
why the cold shoulder?
I'm not--I'm not giving you the cold shoulder.
I'm just--I'm--I'm distracted.
I know what this is about.
you do?
it's Charlotte.
I should have told youbefore I outed us.
I'm sorry.
you can't walk out. It's your office.
he was never gonna say anything.
he had these women thinking that he's one thing, but he's not.
and the worse part is...
he only felt bad because he'd been exposed, not because of what he'd done.
you don't look surprised.
well, people lie. It's human nature.
and you're okay with that?
do you know how many guyon the force have something on the side?
I should know. I'm their alibi half the time.
and you cover for them while they're out having affairs?
these guys are like my brothers. -What about their wives back home, -just too bad for them? -I'm not encouraging it, Addison.
I'm just saying it happen.
Yeah, well, maybe it shouldn't happen.
you want to talk about last night?
what about last night?
I gotta go. It's a work thing.
we'll talk later, okay?
uh, I just talked to Henry, and he's agreed to dothe spinal tap.
Oh, all right.
well, at least you got what you wanted.
look, Sam, I know you don't agree with me on this one.
you're right. I don't. All right?
you're putting Frances at risk.
for Henry, for Frances.
I hope it is for them...
and not for you.
Hey, Addison. - I think I may have just gone too far.
with what?
I followed Kevin.
what do--what do you mean, you followed him?
at first it was just a routine surveillance.
you are not a cop.
I followed him to work, to the precinct, which is apparently where I should've stopped.
Oh, god. Where--where are you now, crazy woman?
I'm not insane. I went to the precinct.
five minutes later, he comes roaring out of the parking garage in another car, a van.
did it-- did it not occur to you that he might be working?
of course he could be working.
only maybe he's not working.
people lie, I.
they lie and they cheat and they ruin people's lives, and I am not gonna be one of those women who gets duped.
Addison--Addison, you need to be careful.
or maybe he's working.
Addison? -I gotta go.
get out of the car!
I'm sorry.
I- is there-- keep your handswhere I can see them and step out of the vehicle now!
no, no, no, no. I'm not part of any of this, though.
step out of the vehicle now.
open the door from the outside.
turn around.
what?
Wh--oh!
Oh, not handcuffs. You can't be serious.
who were you on the phone with?
Oh, no. I was talking to my friend.
were you calling someone inside that building?
no, no, no, no. I'm a doctor.
I'm--I'm a surgeon.
I can show-- -whoever you are, you're obstructing justice.
no, I can show you-- -Addison?
Hey, Kev.
you were spying on me?
not spying.
okay, yes, spying.
you want to tell me what's going on?
I just...
I spent all day dealing with a seemingly normal guy who's the liar of all liars, so...
I checked your Blackberry before you left.
you did what?
Yes, and I saw the missed calls from Leslie, and I wanted to see who she was.
well, you already have.
officer Leslie Davis.
and I wouldn't call him "she"to his face.
Oh.
why are you looking for reasons not to trust me?
fine.
Kev-- -get out.
just...just go.
Cooper the internet dateris in a healthy relationship, and my too-good-to-be-trueboyfriendthinks I'm a psychoticbunny boiler.
he'll come around.
I screwed up.
I mean, he said what he said and I...
lost my mind.
Addison, Amy and Lauraare here.
Why? - I called them.
why'd you bring us here?
I thought you should talk.
I don't want to talk about this.
I was up all night. I felt sick to my stomach.
I feel like this is my fault somehow.
I- I should've known.
neither of you did anything wrong.
you trusted the person you love.
th's the normal thing to do.
Pete's right.
Daniel is the only person here who's done anything wrong.
bastard.
look, you've both been burned, but maybe there's a way that you can help each other.
I don't want help from her.
Pete, we shouldn't-- -we should.
you share a common bond.
your children are going to be siblings.
each of you understands what the other one is feeling better than anyone else.
I feel lost.
Daniel was...
my one constant, the only thing I could always depend on.
we should've made this decision about our baby together.
I don't know if I can do this by myself.
no, no.
I-I don't know her, and I don't want to know her.
look, Amy, you're both hurting right now, but maybe there's a chance you can help each other work through this.
damn it!
I think...
I- I think my water broke.
how much longer?
just another minute.
I promise.
thank you, Helen.
how do you feel, Frances?
what?
are you...
Where's the music?
I thought there was supposed to be music.
she's gonna be fine.
the worst isver.
no, look at her. I never should've put her through this.
this may work, Henry, and it could give you...
at least something.
if only I can talk with her, even for a minute, look into her eyes and know that she sees me, really sees me.
okay, Amy...
you're about 8 centimeters dilated. How are you feeling?
Daniel was supposed to be here.
if you want me to, I'll call him.
I don't want to see him.
but I don't want to be alone.
you haven't told Cooper the truth yet.
you're not very good at letting things go, are you?
you know what I think?
I think you're scared.
of what?
I think this relationship is getting real, so you're just as scared as Cooper is.
so you're trying to sabotage it.
take a new job, rent the floor under him, keep it from him
you want this to blow up in your face.
you know what I think?
I think you're not half the shrink you think you are.
where are you going?
to tell Cooper the truth.
why isn't she responding?
we knew we could only try, Henry.
remember the last november, we were at home?
it was raining and cold.
you were reading in your chair.
I saw you shivering, and I asked you if you wanted me to turn the heat up.
and you smiled, and you said yes.
so I went downstairs and turned the thermostat up.
and when I came back up, I told you I- I had done it.
but you didn't know me.
that was the last time we spoke.
please don't let that be our last memory together.
we need a new memory.
this is too hard for him.
Frances, it's me...
your husband is here and he needs your help.
you--you need to do this for him.
I'm sorry, Henry.
I'm so sorry there wasn't more that we could do for her.
I understand.
where am I? -You're here now.
that's what's important.
you look so beautiful.
you look so tired.
I've missed you.
I've missed you every day.
Frances, Henry promised you that he would never put you in a nursing home.
I'm sick, aren't I?
Yeah.
you'll visit me every day.
you'll come see me every day and hold my hand.
you promise me that?
but, Franny-- -you promise me that, Henry.
and then...
you let me go.
promise me, my love.
I promise.
okay, Amy, on three, I'm gonna need you to push, all right?
ready? One, two, three.
push.
good. That's good. Good.
now take a breath.
I hate him!
concentrate on your baby.
I'm trying.
breathe. -It's--it's so hard.
no.
no.
take my hand.
no. -Just take my hand.
we'll do this together, okay?
you can trust me.
okay, when I say push again, you're gonna push, Amy, all right?
and ready? -You can do this.
no.
push.
we need to talk.
thank god.
What--what do you mean, thank god?
I mean something's been bothering you.
you haven't been yourself.
okay, I feel like you think that because I'm with Charlotteand things are going well that I'm not gonna be there for you, but I--I'm here for you, Violet.
and the fact that Charlotte and I are great doesn't change that.
okay?
let's talk.
Oh, okay.
I've...
just...
you know what? You just said it.
I- I think I was worried about you and Charlotte and what that meant, but...
I just want to see you happy, Coop.
it's a wonderful facility, Henry.
she'll have her own room with 24-hour care.
for the first time in almost 50 years, we won't be living together.
you gonna be okay?
I have to be.
I promised her.
what's wrong?
that man loves that woman more than anything in the world.
he stayed with her, for better, for worse, and, uh, now they're gonna be apart.
just because they're not gonna beliving together anymore, just because...
they won'tbe sleeping in the same bed or having the same conversations, it doesn't mean he's gonna stop loving her.
that man is going to love her always.
he's gonna love her until the day he dies, but...
he needs to move on.
I need to know everything there is to know about digeorge syndrome because I'm gonna keep my baby, and I need to be prepared.
I can't stay with somebodyI can't trust.
we are gonna be there for you, for whatever you need.
Amy, Laura, hear me out.
stay away from me.
you need to leave.
Hey, I'm talking to them, not you.
no, not anymore.
please. I need to see them.
they don't want to see you.
don't make this worse by-- -I love them.
I want to help.
Amy just gave birth.
Laura is dealing witha pregnancy that's taken a very difficult turn.
and they both just found out the man they love is a liar.
don't make this worse.
if you really love them, if you want to help...
leave.
you want me to walk away, to walk away from them?
right now, yes.
and they may never want to see you again.
that's something you're gonna have to live with.
but you married them, you made commitments, and you have children.
what I'm saying is that you are gonna spend the rest of your life making sure that Amy and Laura and these children are taken care of.
he still hasn't called?
no.
I'm sure it's not as bad as it seems.
Oh, no, it is.
I will never hear that sexy, S. W. A. T.- voice again.
this here is my desk, and this is my chair.
pretty cool, right? -I like it.
can I spin?
Yeah, you can spin.
meet Betsey.
Betsey, this is Addison and Naomi, and these are daddy's friends.
can you say hello, please?
Hi.
your daughter?
w- why didn't you tell us?
go make me a picture, okay?
I'll put you here.
well, I wanted to, um...
but...
it's a little compliced.
I was 17...
and her mom and I weren't together very long.
and now?
well, uh, her mother's an addict, and last month, she relapsed.
I just...
I just wanted her to be proud of me, um, you know, to see that one of her parents had it together.
that's why I brought her here.
Addison, I promise I'll have it all cleared out by tomorrow, okay?
Hey, Betsey.
how do you like your daddy's office?
I love it.
yeah?
I think I'm ready.
to leave?
to date.
okay. Yeah.
so what happens now?
this is gonna be harder than I thought.
so...
I told them...
you're my girlfriend, and if they didn't like that, they were gonna have to deal with me.
you did?
what about Violet?
I think she was worried about us coming out, but...
I took care of it.
that's it?
she's happy for me...
for us.
I guess I misjudged her.
did you bring your squad car?
I need an explanation, Addison.
I chted on my husband...
with his best friend.
and after that...
my ex-husband cheated on me, too.
so when you said, uh, you said...
"I love you,"it took everything to this whole other place, this dark place where the stakes were high.
I couldn't trust you--not because of you--because of me.
and I think I was scared because I do like you.
I like you...
a lot, Kevin, and I am...
not in a place where I can say what you said, but...
I think if you were to stick around a little while,
I might be able to get there, because you are honest and loyal and worthy of trust.
I messed up.
but I think...
I might get there.
talk about this? - No.
no talking.
my life has too much talk.
how does Kevin leave one sockehind?
I mean, don't you think he'd notice that one bare foot when he went to put his shoes on?
call him.
he walked out.
you miss him. Call him.
no. Do you want to go get a drink tonight?
I'll figure it out better when I'm drunk.
I... can't.
I- I have to work. - Work?
Wyatt work?
pacific wellcare work? Working for the enemy?
Oncofertility is new, and it's interesting.
you think Wyatt's interesting.
well...
he is.
he's arrogant.
Yeah, but he's smart and incredibly handsome.
you're not really...
Oh, okay, you know what? Never mind. I am...
none of my business. - Exactly.
if you want to sell your soul, I'll still be your friend.
when I used to go in for chemo, to help me get through it,
I'd concentrate on exactly what was going to happen.
the ovarian tissue, I tried to imagine the blood starting to flow and my ovaries starting to work again
Claudia, this is not your fault.
the tissue is very fragile, and your body has been through much more than any body should.
I just thought if I was positive, it would work.
I picked out the crib and I painted the nursery yellow.
we tried, Claudia.
there just wasn't enough blood supply in your abdomen for the ovarian tissue to survive.
and there's nothing else?
I'm not gonna be able to have a baby?
wait, well, we only implanted half of the ovarian tissue that you took out, right?
right, but we just saw, the procedure doesn't work.
no, my procedure doesn't work, but if we were to implant the ovarian tissue deeper, more proximate, to--to a more vigorous blood supply, then
next to the uterus? - Yeah.
well, what you're saying is theoretically possible, but the surgery is far too complicated.
I don't know anyone that can-- - I do.
and this person could help me?
I don't know.
I'll have to ask her.
Oh, sorry. Betsey.
pacific wellcare ruins another day...
and a shirt.
Heather was supposed to pick her up first thing.
that's okay. I got another shirt in the office.
honey, maybe not such a good idea to be throwing balls around in the office, okay?
it wasn't her fault. It was mine.
what wasn't your fault, champ?
Oh, Dr. Freedman. - Arlene.
Hi. Oh, my God.
is this Michael? Dude, you're a giant.
will, you remember me? Yeah!
Hi, Jeffrey.
that's a pretty cool plane.
Hey, let's go back. Come on.
so where you been? It's been, uh...
two years. - Yeah.
I moved the boys to Switzerland...
Oh. - For Jeffrey.
I found this great experimental program there for autistic children...
nontraditional therapy, megavitamins, diet modification...
along with art, music therapy.
and how's it been going? - Better, I think.
his temper's under control a lile more.
um, he's obsessed with airplanes.
sometimes he'll even talk to you...
as long as it's about planes.
planes are good.
talking about planes...
even better.
and how's his health otherwise?
Oh, Jeffrey's fine. No, I-it's Michael, actually.
he caught a cold on the plane.
it's probably just some bug, but, you know...
all right. - I wanted to be safe.
up for you.
so how'd you like switzerland, Michael?
they had a cable car, and there's this one place where you could take a chocolate tour, and my best friend has sheeps and cows at his house.
what? Sheeps and cows at his house?
I made butter.
you did? You made butter? Really? Wow.
hmm. 102.
does your throat hurt, Michael? - Nope.
okay. Open up for me, big and wide.
tilt your head back.
Dr. Freedman? What is it?
what's wrong?
I need to ask you something, and I know what you're gonna say, so I don't want you to say anything, at least, not until you hear me out.
it's about Wyatt.
I need a favor. - No. I'm not helping you get a date.
no. Not for him, - for my patient. - His patient.
who I'm trying to help.
but I can't, and you can.
we have to close the doors.
see, even Cooper realizes pacific wellcare is putting us out of business.
no, we have to close the doors.
my patient has the measles and was in reception for half an hour running around.
everyone that was out,
all our patients this morning have been exposed.
measles? My pregnant patients...
and the elderly. - All at risk.
we have to close the doors. - We have to close the doors.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but the virus stays airborne for up to four hours.
we need to make sure everyone who was exposed has been immunized.
excuse me?
Uh， can I get the shot now? I have a lunch at 12: 30.
Oh, I'm sorry. It contains a live virus.
it's not safe to take when you're pregnant.
but if your blood comes back and your antibodies are low, then we can treat it with immunoglobulin.
and if that doesn't work?
doesn't measles lead to birth defects?
let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?
uh, we need to notify L. A. County health.
they're gonna want to do a complete survey.
and they're always awful.
as if we didn't have enough to do this morning...
okay, I have a light day.
you have to deal with this. I'll speak to the health department.
m, uh, I'm in the mood for a fight.
will's fine.
so far, but he hasn't been vaccinated, and he's at risk to get this.
it's the measles.
I-I--when my parents were growing up, everyone got it.
and hundreds of people died from it every year.
the vaccine changed-- - don't even think of suggesting.
there's no proven link between vaccinations and autism.
it's not just me.
I have talked to dozens of parents...
you vaccinated Jeffrey, and it was like a light went out inside him, and he's living in some parallel world.
Arlene-- - you don't live with him.
so don't ask me to risk will, too.
Hey.
Hey, I haven't get ahold of Betsey's mom. I don't know if she's been immunized.
most kids have been.
you don't know her mother, okay? She forgot to pick her up.
you think she remembered doctor visits?
sh-should I just give her the shot to be sure?
I mean, she played with that kid for, like, a half-hour.
you have 24 hours to give the vaccine.
so wait for the mom and ask, spare her the needle if you can.
grab a chart. We're checking every patient who was in here this morning for immunization.
how many of these are we looking at, Coop?
how many what? - These little bombs
kids coming in without their vaccinations.
the vast majority of my practice is pro-vaccine.
whether or not to vaccinate should not even be open for debate.
well, it isn't, but I agree with the academy of american pediatrics that we shouldn't abandon patients who choose not to vaccinate.
Cooper's right.
you can't kick a kid out just because the parents believe in a conspiracy theory about vaccines.
the C. D. C. is clear
vaccines do not cause autism, they save lives.
that's the end of story.
Hey, I was just in the pediatric waiting area with Betsey.
uh, this is Michael's mom's, and she left it in the lobby.
so if she was down at pacific wellcare...
then her kids were, too. Someone's gotta tell Charlotte.
uh, hi. I need to speak to Dr. King. It's important.
you're Dr. Freedman, right? - Yeah.
I'm Sheldon. Sheldon Wallace.
Violet's friend. - Right, yeah.
well, I hope so. I...
I'd le that. She's, uh...
how is she... Violet?
exposed to the measles. - Expose to the measles?
a kid in our practice has the measles, which is why I'm here.
this concerns me how?
well, you have this wonderful coffee bar that you advertise so prominently, and a lot of our patients wander by on their way upstairs.
it is good coffee. - Yeah.
you've exposed my entire practice to the measles?
Claudia Jenkins needs a surgeon, a surgeon with a background in both gynecology and fertility, someone who can implant the ovarian tissue close enough to the uterine blood supply to aow her to produce her own eggs.
Naomi was right. You want a miracle.
no, I want you-- just as a surgeon.
you'd perforthe ocedure at St. Ambrose-- neutral territory.
you bill all you want. Naomi and I do the follow-up.
you just go in and cut and implant, and you're done.
Claudia gets a baby.
you're not tainted by working with me.
take a look.
tell me that this surgery wouldn't be amazing.
you don't get me at all.
you think all I want to do is cut?
if I do a surgery, I do the follow-up.
I make sure it takes, I see the pregnancy the whole way through.
now you may just look at procedures and outcomes.
but my patients get me for the whole process.
well, that would be even better.
read the file, Dr. Montgomery...
before you say no.
are you still having sex th the Same guy?
with the Same guy, huh?
finally gonna fess up and tell me with who?
I told you whom it was, and you didn't believe me.
who it was, and you told me Pete, which is obfuscation.
lying, reay. - It's Pete, Cooper.
I'm having sex with Pete.
you need me to prove it to you?
lift your shirt. - excuse me?
I need you to lift up your shirt.
trust me. I'm a doctor.
you're a pediatrician. That's like half a doctor.
lift.
this isn't one of your weird...
there's a tattoo.
you're sleeping with Violet?
do you have to sleep with everybody?
I don't sleep with everybody a
you sleep with people and then they leave the practice.
do you want Violet to leave the practice?
I'm not gonna leave.
you told him? It's just sex.
Oh, no. You're not capable of just having sex.
you are a relationship junkie.
and Pete is the anti-relationship.
Pete is the ruiner of relationships.
Pete is-- - Pete is right here.
and you know it's true.
isn't that, like, the proverbial pot calling the kettle
Cooper, Cooper, Cooper, I'm fine.
we're fine.
there's nothing to worry about.
Claudia Jenkins could have a baby.
thank you, Addison.
there's one condition. - Yes.
this is a one-time thing.
we help Claudia, and then you are done working with Wyatt.
you're... you're blackmailing me.
no, no, it's not blackmail. It's extortion.
I'm doing this for your own good, Nai.
what, so--so that I don't become corrupted and evil like him, so I don't extort promises from my friends?
do you want me to do the surgery?
I guess I have no choice.
okay, so that's it. Everybody's been immunized.
everybody that was here has been contacted.
you can rele all these immunization records.
Oh, no, he can't.
Sonya Nichols. County health department.
I'm gonna need those.
Oh, uh, Sam Bennett. I, uh, I called you.
uh, are--are those all the immunization records?
uh, yeah. Yeah, this is everything.
okay, I want the vaccination records of all the patients in your practice, and then after I interview all personnel and review their employment certificates,
I'll need to inspect your isolation facilities.
well, we don't have, uh, isolation facilities per se, uh, but
well, wait. We, uh, we provide for rooms. We just
are not up to current guidelines?
or are you aware of the recent changes in those standards?
uh, this isn't gonna be very much fun, is it?
you want to show me around?
Yeah. All right, this way.
S--his fever, it was 104 by the time I got home.
I- I couldn't get it down.
how you feeling, Michael?
I'm really cold, and my stomach hurts.
he vomited twice.
his lungs are congested.
Oh, okay. Okay. Okay, we got you.
it's okay.
we're gonna get you some fluids, and we'll bring that fever down, and you'll feel better.
I need a nasal cannula at 2 liters, chest x-rays and cultures times two.
I don't understand. Why is he so sick?
Arlene, measles is serious.
it can lead to pneumonia, encephalitis-- all sorts of other complications.
notify peds I. C. U. We need an isolation room.
Michael's resting now. Hifever's down.
but he's still having trouble breathing.
my husband is
is still in Switzerland. You don't think he...
needs to fly back?
if it was my son, I'd come.
Arlene, we need to talk about will.
I-I--no. I told you no.
no vaccinations.
I don't think you can risk putting will through what Michael's going through.
I can't risk putting will through what Jeffrey's gone through.
I lost one child to autism. I can't lose another.
Arlene, you won't.
don't you think seeing Michael in there like that...
I would do anything for my kids.
I can't.
look at him.
don't you remember when he was 2, that smile?
he'd light up the room.
and then you vaccinated him, and that kid vanished.
those vaccines took him away.
I don't care what you know.
I know what I know.
I know what I lost.
I can't risk it again.
I can't believe this health department lady is making us jump through all these hoops.
she's horrible. - How's Michael?
uh, not good, and Arlene still won't let me vaccinate will.
you should call family services.
you serious? - Yes, it's child abuse.
she's knowingly putting her son at risk for getting really sick.
it's irresponsible. - It's a parent's decision.
Yeah, well, if I find out that Heather didn't vaccinate Betsey, I'll report her.
can I see you a moment, Dr. Bennett?
perfect.
that can't be good. - Sam's right. I gotta call.
calling D. C. F. S. while her other child is still in the hospitalwould just be cruel.
cruel? Putting another child in danger is cruel.
exposing a city to measles is cruel.
Violet's right. You can't fault the mother just because she chose not to.
Oh, yeah, of course you're gonna agree with Violet. You're sleeping with her.
I agree with her because she's right, and I'm sleeping with her because it's part of the fun of being an adult.
we can do whatever we want with whomever we want however much we want.
so if everyone would just relax and let us be adults about this...
we need to go over protocol.
um, how did you dispose of the contaminated exam items used on the sick boy?
tongue depressors, gloves, thermometer cover?
uh, we use a, uh, a medical waste company.
Needlesticks--did you follow C. D. C. approved guidelines?
I- I- I assume so.
I- I can check, but
and at kind of ventilation system do you have?
cause you'd be amazed how many practices don't have a laminar flow room.
right. Es. Laminar flow is good.
you don't know what that is, do you?
Dr. Nichols, look, I've spent hours, uh, jumping through hoops for you.
you shouldn't have to jump through hoops.
it should all be standard.
it should all be covered in your procedures and policy manual, which it's required by law you have.
so I can see it?
you want to see our p- procedures and policy manual?
Yes.
okay.
look, we just rented out a floor and moved all oufiles.
so it may take a while.
okay, well, you have till tomorrow to find it.
violet has got to know that this is not good for her or the practice.
says the person who slept with my brother.
Oh, now that was-- - oh, different?
Oh, yeah, totally and completely different...
in every way. - What? Are you okay with it?
Yeah, she seems happy.
seems happy, you know, I...
Hi. - Hi.
can I help you?
Yeah, I'm looking for dell parker.
uh, you are? - I'm Heather. I'm Betsey's mom.
Oh. Uh, yeah.
his office is at the end of the hall. It's the last one.
thank you.
that's Heather? She's so...
she's not at all what I expected.
why did you do that?
I told you to tell you, not to tl everyone.
I have to go to the bathroom.
what's your issue? You-- you don't want me to be happy?
of course I want you to be happy.
I have to go to the bathroom are you jealous of Pete, is that it?
no. No.
okay, maybe a little.
look, you have what Charlotte and I had
the "just sex" part
before it got all messed up with emotions and feelings and betrayal, which is where the "just sex" train ultimately leads.
I don't want you to get hurt.
look, this is not "Romeo and Juliet," Coop.
there's not some tragedy looming.
we-- we had an itch and we scratched...
and scratched...
and scratched.
okay. That's all it is.
it's just that last time...
Allan-- - I know what I'm doing, Coop.
I do.
I'm sorry I told...
everyone.
can I pee now?
Yeah.
mommy!
I had a job interview, and they really liked me, so they made me take all these different tests.
it took forever. I'm sorry.
babe...
why don't you go finish that puzzle, okay?
mommy needs to talk to daddy.
you couldn't call?
you leave your daughter alone all day and you don't call?
I forgot my phone. - Are you using?
no.
no. Look, I know you're mad, but
I knew she was safe with you, okay?
I-I couldn't leave to make a call.
I did not want to blow this interview. - Well, she's not safe, okay?
she was exposed to the measles today, and I-I don't even know if s vaccinated because, you know, I'm not around enough, and you...
is she vaccinated?
you don't know, do you?
no.
I thought that was you.
not going home?
it's been a hell of a day.
Yeah, but a cup of non-fourth-floor coffee, the fresh air, the ocean-- it all goes away.
look at you, all calm and buddhist.
so you and Violet?
it's no big deal. It's not a relationship.
well...
if you're happy...
things not going well with you and Kevin?
Kevin and I are...
different, and I still haven't figured out if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
you want my advice?
please. - Ignore all advice.
Cooper is all over Violet about how I'm gonna destroy her life.
I just think people should be left to decide things for themselves.
and what do you think?
about you and Kevin? - About you and Violet.
Oh.
w- well, I...
the conversation is easy, the sex is...
good.
we laugh a lot.
I mean, it's no big deal.
we're just similar and we want the same thing, so it's working out.
what?
you've got all that, and it's not a big deal?
isn't that what a relationship is?
good morning.
Hello, Sheldon.
it's good to see you.
I've missed seeing you.
elevator rides are always more pleasant with you.
hold the elevator.
glad to see I'm not the only one.
so you look...
did you do something different? Y- you look great.
she did something different.
well, whatever it is, just keep doing it.
there's a little bleeder on the distal uterus. - Got it.
Hey, do you think I missed the boat with Pete?
Ugh. You didn't miss e Pete boat. You dodged hurricane Pete.
you really think it's gonna end that badly? - Are we talking aboutthe Same Pete?
sorry I'm late. Lots of patients to save.
well, why don't you go save some more and let us work?
work, or discuss dating colleagues?
which truthfully, I concur is a bad idea.
however, since this is our last case together, monty, it won't be a problem for us.
she's involved with a cop who has a gun.
Yeah, so you better watch out.
a cop? Are you really dating a cop?
I am not intimidated by a man with a gun.
are you? Intimidad? Hardly.
no, I was thinking of their propensity for depression and divorce and alcoholism.
Yeah, as opposed to doctors, who have a stable, stress-free life.
true, true, but I could see how a cop fulfills some kind of base fantasy for a woman like you.
Wow. Did you miss the sexual harassment seminar?
well, I meant it as a compliment. I mean, she's a rich, classy woman.
he's your versionof the pool boy. - Okay, enough.
you are here to watch.
you know what I got here? - I'm not in the mood, Charlotte.
public health notifications, isolation requirements, incident reports, C. D. C Surveys.
we all have jobs to do.
I have jobs I'm not able to do because I'm dealing with the mess you made.
and I have a mom who feels like she lost one son to autism and may be losing another one to the measles, and she's got another one sitting out here exposed, and maybe I'm just not persuasive enough, but he's vulnerable, and she's not gonna let me do anything about it.
so I'm really sorry if i piled on some paperwork for you, but I don't need crap from you right now.
he can't breathe.
full custody?
you want full custody? - I'm trying to keep Betsey safety.
now?
now that I've changed? Now that I'm finally getting it together?
you left her here all day. - But I got the job, Dell.
okay, but...
how long until you blow it off because, you know, you hate it or you're bored or you start using again?
I got the job, and then I got home and I got this letter.
and you know what I wanted to do, but I didn't, okay?
I freaked, but then I looked atetsey, and I didn't use.
I came here to talk to you about what's best for her.
I'm glad u didn't get high.
but it doesn't change things.
all you see is that girl from the valley that you used to get high with.
I stopped.
well, you might have been stronger than me then, but don't forget who got me started, okay?
because I wasn't always like this.
just don't make me spend every last dime that I have trying to fight you.
it's gonna push me back over the edge.
every bit of tissue around her ovaries is friable.
I can't place a stitch without her starting to bleed.
how much chemo did you give her? - I did what I had to toave her life.
no, there's too much blood. I've gotta clear the field.
damn it. - You need to implant the tissue now.
everything I touch bleeds. We can't do this.
you have time to control the bleeding and to complete the implant.
back off, Wyatt. I can't see the target through the blood... and her pressure's dropping.
if you don't get this done now, she loses any chance of ever having a baby.
if I don't stop the hemorrhaging, she dies, and we don have worry about a baby.
all right. We're done.
Wyatt, shut your mouth while I save her life.
it won't pass. His throat's too swollen.
get the ber-optic scope now.
we gotta ventilate him.
heart rate is dropping. Sats are bottoming out.
Where's the damn scope? - It's coming, Cooper.
open up a surgical instrument. I'm gonna crike him. Hold this.
what--what--what is that? What--what are you gonna do? - Just wait, Cooper. The scope's coming.
his heart's 40. I'm doing this. Betadine.
wait. Wait!
slowly.
easy does it.
almost there. Almost there.
I got it.
sounds good. - He's gonna be okay?
set the vent at an F 102 of 100, rate of 24.
I need a minute.
Hey, I'll watch 'em for a minute.
Hey. Come here.
come here for a second. Ahh.
one second.
get the hell away from my son. - Mommy!
you have to stop. - Your son is dying in there.
get the hell away from me. - Mrs. Perkins, please.
No! - good.
U okay?
the vaccine is safe.
you don't know. - It is.
look at him and tell me it is. - Vaccines are the standard of care.
Dr. Freedman did something that was medically necessary.
he assaulted my son.
and I am going to sue this hospital, so help me, if something happens to him.
I did what I felt I had to. - It wasn't yours to do.
it wasn't yos to do.
code blue, P. I. C. U.
code blue, P. I. C. U.
I went under thinking about the crib in the yellow room.
I wish we could've done more.
I know I should just be grateful for being alive.
we all wanted to help you.
and I'm not giving up, Claudia.
I'll be back later, okay?
nai, would you go over post-operate instructions for Claudia?
I'll be right back.
what was that about? - That was about my embarrassment for picking the wrong person for the job.
you're blaming this on me?
the chemo ravaged her entire body.
there weren't 2 square centimeters of healthy tissue that could've held a suture let alone an implant.
you talk like you searched exhaustively.
what are you talking about? - You didn't push.
I agreed to do a totally experimental procedure that, going in, we all knew was a longshot, and when I felt the risks to the patient's life outweighed the potential for success, I chose to save the patient.
you had time. You could've controlled the bleeding and implanted the tissue, but you hate me, so you didn't want to be told what to do, so you stopped.
you wanted to prove that you knew better.
I'm no surgeon, but I think there was time.
well, I'm sorry if what happened in there didn't produce the results that you wanted for some study, but I made the right call.
you really believe that?
Dr. Bennett. - I got it. I got it.
okay.
everything is in here. All right?
protocols for workspace contamination, follow-ups for patients with positive labs, blood draw procedures that include responses to needlesticks.
okay.
wait, that's it?
you... you're not gonna read it and ask me about our policies on work-related injuries or
I'm sure you did a very thorough job.
you knew that I wouldn't be able to find it, and you knew that I would kill myself trying to come up with it.
well, by law, your office needed to have that. Nor you do.
you enjoy this, don't you, the power?
coming in here, pushing me around...
Oh, I... that's not true at all.
I've been nothing but professional. - You've been a bully.
you just can't stand real doctors, can you?
do you...
know what it's like to have everyone hate you before they even meet you, to walk in the door and have everyone assume that you're awful?
I don't know what some evil public servant did to you in a past life, but I'm here to do a job, a job I think is important.
if there were a serious outbreak here, you'd want someone like me, because I am a real doctor who chose this job to help people.
all right, well, maybe I was wrong, but...
for the past two days, you haven't even looked me in the eye or even acknowledged that I'm a human being.
what is your problem?
for two days, I've been thinking your lips would taste like chocolate, and I couldn't look at them.
I'm-- I'm-- I'really sorry that I misjudged you.
do you believe that people can change? Ugh!
look, if one more person butts in and tries to tell me what Pete is and what we should be doing.
uh, I was talkingabout Heather.
Oh. Okay.
so you and Heather...
okay, well, Heather says that she's not the person she used to be, and...
that by taking custody of Betsey,
I'm punishing her for her past.
are you?
I just don't know if I can believe it, that she's different now.
well, you have to protect your daughter.
right. But if you're asking me if I think people can change, if I didn't believe that, I couldn't do what I do.
when you look at Betsey and Heather, and you take away what you want, what's best for your daughter?
what?
I don't think it's ridiculous...
the idea that you and me-- that...
we could be more than sex.
Pete-- don't think about what Cooper would say or Sam or Naomi or anybody.
just think about...
what you think.
why does it have to be a crazy idea?
asystole. I can't find a pulse.
resuming C. P. R. another round of EPI.
Cooper, we've done everything. It's been over half an hour.
Where's the atropine? Come on!
it's time to call it. - I'm running the code. I decide when we're done.
please... don't stop.
time of death--3: 37.
he just learned to tie his shoes.
he can't be gone.
not like this.
Oh, Michael.
Oh, Michael.
Oh, Michael. Michael.
I thought...
it was gonna be... like a cold.
I was trying to protect him.
you did everything you could.
what are you doing in here? - I was thinking about the two doctors that came before Addison...
about you...
and them leaving.
people can change, Violet.
isn't that what you told dell? - Yes you can change.
I-I don't know if I can change what I know about you...
how I look at you.
what about what you feel?
well, I can't separate that out. What I feel is aombination of all those things, and I can't help it.
look what happened between you and meg.
I screwed that up, but it was wrong before I screwed it up.
I like what we have, Pete.
I mean, I...
I love what we have.
but I don't... want it to be more.
wouldn't that be a good thing?
what we have, but...
more?
I don't know.
what are you doing here?
come to get evidence?
there's no needles, Dell, no booze.
Hey, beautiful. - Hi, daddy.
I came to apologize.
look...
you were right, okay?
I- I should've called, - and I should've been more responsible about the vaccines- - not about that.
for getting you started...
addicted.
I should have kept you away from my friends back then.
I'm sorry, Heather.
well, I'm doing better now.
you know, we're doing better. - I know.
I can see.
but I need more time with her, something more permanent.
Dell- - maybe we can...work it out, you and me, without court.
okay?
I just...
I need to know she's safe.
apparently, I'm a misogynistic, manipulative son of a bitch...
and ungrateful.
you agreed to do something you didn't want to do, and I should've been more gracious.
you protecting my honor? - I don't like bullies.
maybe he was right. Oh, I hate him.
I hate his arrogance and his pushing and...
if Claudia was my patient, maybe I'd have done the same thing.
pushed to ma it work? - Addison...
you saved her life.
look...
if you want to work with Wyatt again, work with Wyatt again.
don't not do it because of what I say. - You comfortable with that?
I'm not comfortable thinking that my advice colors what you say or, you know, what you do.
hate him for yourself.
or not.
I could use one.
no. I am going to take my own advice and decide something for myself.
come on in.
I wanted to finish the...
conversation from the elevator.
I, uh...
I meant what I said, Violet.
I like you. And I'd like for us to be friends.
and I'm not exactly sure how one goes about doing that, because I'd like to get to know you better.
not go out on a date, just go out, as friends and without all that pressure of sex and dating and...
I just...
I think we'd be good friends.
I think you're right.
Hey, Kevin.
it's me.
Yeah, I,um...
I miss you.
you should see her room.
she's got surf posters everywhere.
as soon as my heart is better,
I'm gonna have a birthday party on the beach, and I'm gonna learn how to surf.
I've been watching them from my window, and it's totally cool.
that sounds totally awesome.
so how's our patient doing?
Annie, this is Dr. Barnes.
Dr. Barnes is gonna remove the tumor from your heart.
what happened to the other guy?
this guy's much better than the other guy.
Dr. Barnes is the best heart guy in L. A.
this is gonna be your last surgery. That's how good he is.
and so I snagged him for you because I'm on your side.
right? right.
well, it is a 6-hour procedure, so we should probably get going.
right, Annie?
you'll be here when I come out?
I'lle here.
don't look so scared.
it's gonna be fine.
finishing or starting? - Finishing. You?
starting.
I've got myocardial resection on a kid.
I hate working on kids.
I feel like I'm holding my breath the entire time.
I know what you mean. I work on babies sometimes.
so you, uh, so you come here often?
was-- that actually sounded like a-- was that a pickup line?
no.
no?
that, uh, I apologize.
okay.
besides, I would, um... I would give a better pickup line than that.
hello. Hello.
hel-- I'm-- I'm not into this.
the bug needs stimulation. I'm the pediatrician.
this is my area.
Hello, little one.
hello. - Hey, guys.
I'm stimulating the bug. We've made a decision.
together?
paternity test, now.
one of us gets out of your hair, the other one has a right to know.
look, guys-- you know what, Cooper?
you moved in, you pushed us out, you've claimed your territory, but one thing is clear
this kid you're talking to is not your kid.
so stay out of it.
look, pete-- the answer is right there for us to know.
we know that you don't want to face it, but we do.
I've gotta go.
well... I have no defining exit line, so...
they told me it was a carjacking.
they told you?
you don't remember?
I remember leaving soccer practice.
I'd parked across campus in student parking.
I got to my car.
there were people around.
I pulled out my keys, and I heard a noise behind me, and...
And?
that's all I remember.
woke up in the ambulance.
I loved that car.
I love school.
this guy came into my world and... oh, I'm pissed.
I'd like you to see our psychiatrist Dr. Turner.
Really?
cause other than pissed, I'm okay.
just... do me the favor so you stay that way.
you know what'll make me okay?
when they catch this guy.
are you snooping?
uh, this is public space. I'm just standing here.
snooping.
do you want to know what's going on or not?
of course I do.
okay, possible baby daddies demanded paternity test.
said my name during sex with her.
No! Okay, wait a minute.
how do you know all this, just by watching? What, do you read lips now?
no, Sam told me the whole name thing.
what? We are friends.
he tells me stuff.
we're just friends.
and Violet was yelling so loud, it just oh, god. He called out your name.
don't-- I'm the only person that the man has had sex with in the last 15 years.
it was just habit.
that's all.
we're just friends.
I wish someone would call out another woman's name in bed with me.
hell, I'd even take not knowing who the father of my baby was.
either way, it would mean that I'd had a man on top of me in recent history.
you know what? That's really sad.
I know.
I thought somebody was trying to pick me up
and--and I felt my knees open just a little bit.
I don't want to spoil the fun, but I've got Betsey with me today, and "say my name" and "who's your daddy" are getting a little loud, and don't want to have to explain what a paternity test is to my 6 year old.
I'm not telling 'em to shut up.
Oh, no, no, me neither.
I will have a paternity test when I want to have a paternity test.
you can't do one for a few weeks anyway.
who do they think they are, telling me what to do?
it's my body. It's my uterus.
you can't do one for a few weeks anyway.
I mean, yes, yes, I was... a little bit irresponsible, having unprotected sex with two men, but does that give them the right to dictate
violet, you can't do a C. V. S. Paternity test for a few weeks.
the point is mute.
moot.
the point is moot.
is it "moot"? I'm pretty sure it's mute.
no, it's moot. The point is moot.
I can't have a paternity test for weeks.
I didn't come here to... I need you to see a patient.
is the point moot or is the point mute?
Annie's out of surgery.
Where's the patient?
you were in bed with me, and you called out another woman's name.
I know, and, uh, it was wrong, but I- I was not thinking about her.
I- I-- it just slipped out.
I-I promise.
Sonya, what-- please, what are you-- well, I have to go to work.
and you've explained yourself as best you could, I guess.
well, have a good day, Sonya.
see? There. Sonya. See? I see-- I know it.
it's a beautiful name. Sonya. Sonya.
son-- you're just in the doghouse, you know?
you're just gonna have to suffer, just for a little bit.
maybe I should make her dinner tonight, you know, go all out-- candlelight, flowers, the works.
no, no, no, no, no. You need to take her out.
take her out somewhere nice, somewhere romantic.
the blue sea in Malibu.
the blue sea, the place we used to go?
Yeah, the place with the great mimosas that you drank way too many of.
the blue sea. Yeah, that s-sounds perfect.
the memory loss is not unusual, and it's not necessarily a bad thing.
you're protecting yourself.
I don't want to protect myself.
I want to remember.
the memory may come out naturally, when you're ready to deal with it.
I'm ready to deal with it.
I want to help the police find this guy, and I can't unless I remember. I don't want to be a victim.
I want to find this guy and rip his throat out.
okay.
close your eyes.
okay.
so I want you to think about something you like.
Griffith park.
I like riding horses.
good.
so I want you to see it in your mind, like you're sitting in a movie theater watching it on a screen.
describe what you see.
the horse is chestnut with a white streak down the side of his neck.
we're riding off the trail, up a hill, then we cuthrough some trees, cantering.
good.
so you're relaxed, and you're feeling that, only the picture on the screen is going to change.
focus on the screen.
you see your car, you see yourself.
okay.
now don't bring everything into focus, and you can look away anytime you need to.
but do you see anything about the attacker?
his arm... his hand.
he was white. The guy was white.
I can remember this, can't I?
you can help me remember?
I'll try.
it always starts with the cramping.
my husband and i can't go through this again.
I- I didn't even tell him this time because I...
we just can't take losing another.
well, miscarrying once is hard enough.
but twice must be-- we're not even telling friends and family about the baby this time.
I think I know why you're cramping.
the placenta is implanting low the uterine wall, and that can cause bleeding as the pregnancy progresses.
is that dangerous?
well, it can be unless we can do something about it, and in this case, you can.
sure.
what? Anything.
no sex.
no sex is the treatment?
Really?
Yep.
okay.
so...no sex.
Oh, we'll just spend our evenings reading... and talking and not having sex.
well, if it makes you feel any better,
I'm not having any sex either.
Annie, your tumor was bigger than we expected.
we weren't able to remove all of it.
but Dr. Barnes thinks that more chemo will shrink this tumor, and in another month, he can take it out completely.
that's what you said last time... and the time before that.
thiswas supposed to help.
but none of it helps.
just more hospitals... more medication, staying inside all the time.
I don't want anymore.
don't talk like that.
it'll be okay.
you'll see.
no, it won't.
I don't want anymore surgery.
please.
you promised you were on my side.
tell them no more surgery.
finishing or starting?
finishing. You?
starting. - Our timing.
my pickup lines are usually just honesty.
I don't have any lines.
okay.
for instance?
honesty?
honesty.
you are breathtakingly beautiful.
that's what I'd say, you know, if I were trying to pick youp.
how was that?
th- that was good.
you missed the window.
for the C. V. S. Test.
the risks of puncturing the placenta-- - minimal.
Yes, but it's--it's there.
violet. - Oh, you, too?
she miss her window.
paternity, C. V. S.Window, it's-- it's-- it's gone.
so amnio?
you're far enough along for an amnio.
well, there are risks to...
uh, okay. I'll consider it.
and, uh, while you're at it, will you consider backing off with Jill?
she's in my office, and her body is a mess.
her muscle pain is unreal.
well, she's injured.
she-- she was injured before the attack. You were treating her.
for a rotator cuff tear.
she was getting better.
her treatment was nearly done.
since the attack-- her injuries are not muscular.
pulling up those memories, that's what's eating at her.
if I can walk her through the attack, then I can desensitize her to the memory.
but then you run the risk of retraumatizing her, which her body tells me is what's happening.
you should be careful.
with a trauma, if she's internalizing
I've seen people get really sick.
okay, so now you're ganging up on me about everything?
I'm doing what's best for Jill.
are there bumps along the way? Yes.
but in the end, it's best that she knows now.
she wants to get this guy who did this to her.
so if she remembers, she can put him away and have her life back.
Oh, that's interesting.
sometimes you think it's better to know.
and others... denial works for you.
Jill, what is it?
the man who attacked me, they think they found him.
they want me to come in foa lineup.
your face is all scowly.
Scowly?
well, you didn't light up as soon as you saw me.
this is me, lit.
Hey, Charlotte, what... what's wrong?
I mean, you've been kind of... we've been in a better place, right?
we started fresh?
Yes. I slept with archer, and you forgave me.
better place, fresh start.
But?
but nothing.
everything's fine.
we're in a good place, Coop, really.
you're looking...
don't tell me I look good, Dr. Freedman.
because I don't.
OK, thanks.
well, here's some good news.
I just looked over your labs, and the chemo is doing what it's supposed to.
it's getting you ready for the surgery.
the chemo is making me sick.
I've tried to tell my parents I don't want this surgery, but they won't listen to me.
I know this is hard, but you gotta try to hang in there.
hang in for what?
I know what Dr. Barnes wants to do for me.
the surgery stinks.
only 20% of the people who have it live for more than six months.
and that can be you.
I know I'm sick, and my heart is really bad, and if I do nothing, I'm gonna die.
but this surgery?
chances is not gonna work.
and if I was off this medication,
I could really feel good for a little bit.
I could play with my friends again.
if I had this out of mine... I could go in the ocean.
I could be normal for a little bit.
I'd rather have one good day than be sick for the rest of my life.
the bleeding staed this morning?
Yes, in the shower.
I've been doing everything you told me.
no sex, taking it easy.
I even cut back my hours at work.
this shouldn't be happening.
well, the placenta previa hasn't improved.
so I'm just gonna losing babies...
one after another after another?
Morgan, Morgan, look at me.
you are stressed.
and if you're stressed, then the baby's stressed.
you are not going to lose this baby.
it just means that we need to be more aggressive, okay?
I'm gonna put you on total bed rest for the remainder of your pregnancy, and then I'm gonna watch you very carefully.
I-I want an amnio.
if I'm gonna lay on my back for five months,
I- I need to know this baby's gonna be okay, you know, that there aren't any genetic defects.
an amnio is usually done at 17 weeks, Morgan.
we need to wait another month.
what if-- - no what- ifs.
we're gonna wait.
we're gonna do the amnio at the right time.
Hi, honey.
uh, yes, I'm at the doctor's office.
she's putting me on bed rest.
she's not letting me into the bed.
there's no sex.
and you need sex.
Yeah.
I mean, hey, I'm grown.
dinners are cool, restaurants are cool, but she has me sleeping on the floor.
Oh, god. Come on, Sam. Be smart.
you gotta change the scenery.
you gotta make her forget what happened.
you gotta... take her away to...
I don't know, take her to... the grand spain palm springs.
I remember we had a really good time there.
exactly.
that first weekend after Maya, just the two of us.
we certainly forgot about everything.
Yeah, that was great. That was fun.
I have Maya this weekend, though.
Oh, I will take Maya.
you go. Go have fun. Go whisk her away.
go.
whisk.
we don't know what to do.
she's miserable and sick, and she doesn't want this.
and she makes sense, but she's only 12.
she still loves stuffed animals.
she giggles when she has to talk to boys.
anytime there's thunder, she comes to sleep between us.
I don't want to lose her, but I can't stand forcing her to do something that she doesn't want to do.
you really think you can help her?
I know it's hard, watching her.
but I think if I operate, there's a chance she'll make it.
a chance.
you don't think she should have the surgery?
I don't wanna... this is your decision.
I'm asking you.
please.
I think even in the best-case scenario, it's months in a hospital, constant drug therapies and interventions, and this is not about a cure.
however, considering the alternative...
wait a minute. Go on, Dr. Cooper.
I want to know what you think.
um... I think Annie has considered the alternative.
and even though it terrifies us, for her, the alternative means having a life, a real life like other kids, even if it's just for a little while.
you know, playing outside and maybe going surfing and...
instead of spending her life... in that little roo we have down the hall.
it means celebrating her birthday somewhere other than here.
in the future, we will be able to treat people with Annie's condition much more effectively.
she doesn't have the perspective to understand that because she's still a kid.
you can't put a decision like this in her hands.
if the surgery works, what will her quality of life be?
well, it's hard to know.
she'll be limited in her activities.
you'll need to keep her home mostly.
but with medications, we can sustain her heart.
she'll be alive.
for how long?
I want to take her home.
wait.
you're the one from the scrub room.
I didn't realize 'cause of the hair.
I had this image of it in my head, you know, under the cap, and...
Oh, you didn't recognize me.
okay.
but red.
red is good.
red becomes you.
thank you.
look, I'm sorry.
I am-- I am having a day.
I- I got some bad news, and then I've got this patient...
another doctor has convinced her parents to let her die, which I think-- I know-- is the wrong decision.
anyway, it's a--whew-- a day.
you ever do that?
you ever worry over a patient?
Oh, absolutely. I'm worrying over this pregnant woman right now.
um, Charlotte king.
is that your name?
Oh, no, no. no, she's, um, the chief of staff here.
right. I knew that. I...
you should talk to her.
uh, if you believe your patient should live, then you should fight for it.
and Charlotte-- I mean, well, she's Charlotte, but she-- she'll help you fight.
thank you.
no problem.
well, I should, um, um, go...See Charlotte.
right, of course.
if you seehe man who assaulted you, please identify him by stating aloud his reference number.
take as much time as you need.
you've indicated suspect number 5.
are you sure that's the man who attacked you?
Yes, I'm sure. 5
all right, Miss Avery.
thank you for your Cooperation.
you did it, Jill.
the face... s-seeing it again, it's
it's okay. He can't hurt you anymore.
I thought it would be good.
I- I thought it would help me remember what he did to me.
but it... it's just... I'm scared.
I'm really scared.
I can't believe it's coming out.
I'm gonna get to go in the water for the first time ever, ever.
Dr. Freedman, can I see you for a sec?
what's going on?
just give us a sec.
catheter is not coming out today. -What?
Dr. Barnes approached me.
he feels he can save Annie's life and that you're letting a minor make a decision about refusing treatment.
the family and I concur on this. What are you doing?
he has a valid claim. He's going for a court order.
why are you talking to me like that?
like what? -Like I'm some stranger.
I could've let him sandbag you.
I didn't. Ds-up.
okay, still like a stranger, Charlotte, and you know me.
you know I wouldn't be doing this for her if I didn't think it was right. Come on.
I'm just doing my job.
that doesn't make it right.
there was definitely flirting. With the surgeon?
cute surgeon. Cute surgeon.
it felt good to feel like me again.
Hey, uh, can I steal some of those colored paper clips?
on your desk?
for an art project that Betsey's doing?
she's in a trance.
Oh, resort porn. -Yes.
look, you can-- you can watch whales breach, just right from your Palapa.
when are you going?
Oh, no, no, this isn't for me.
this is for Sam and, uh Sonya.
you're planning a trip for your ex-husband and his new girlfriend.
you realize how weird that sounds?
Yeah, of course I do.
it's ju--look at this place.
I mean, somebody should be enjoying it.
without the surgery, Annie dies.
without the surgery, Annie has a life, at least for a little while.
there are a number of precedents that deal with the denial of medical treatmen to cldren, but they primarily involve the religious convictions of the parents.
this isn't a religious thing, judge.
it's about giving our little girl what she really wants.
look, this is as painful a decision as anyone can face.
I understand why the bishops don't want to make it.
but by giving in to what their child wants...and she is a child.
they are abdicating their parental responsibilities.
do I get a say here?
I'm sorry, Annie, but you don't.
but it's my life.
Yes, but legally, your parents are responsible for making decisions about your medical care.
and you should know that state law prohibits you from acting in any way that endangers Annie's health.
you're going to force them to make Annie undergo the surgery?
that Catheter stays in, and the surgy is scheduled for the first available date.
that's not fair.
that's not fair!
Hey, stranger. -Hey.
I haven't seen you in a while.
Yeah, I lightened my surgical schedule.
I had some personal stuff.
finishing or starting?
starting? You. -Me, too.
I missed you.
I shouldn't say that.
but I did miss you.
why shouldn't you say that?
I just, um
I don't know.
um, I- I should go, uh, back in there before the baby comes out without me and I get sued.
okay. -Okay.
still nothing. Only his face.
I can't remember anything else.
how am I supposed to testify against him if I can't remember anything about what happened?
well, the trial is a month away, Jill. You have time.
you'll remember. -And then what?
I can see what he did to me again and again?
because right now, all see is his face, and I see it everywhere.
at the store, on the boy who packs my groceries, at the gym, every guy in the corridor.
every time I go anywhere, I see him.
and at night, in my dreams-- we can stop.
we can work on helping you cope with where you are today.
no.
I want to put him away.
I need this fear to go away.
okay, I'm gonna insert the needle now.
you might feel a slight pinch.
wait, wait, before you do it, I just need for you to talk to me about anything, just to get my mind off this.
okay, uh, let's see. We can talk about... you know, you said you weren't having sex.
why not?
you're beautiful, successful, yeah, well...I'm kind of in between guys right now.
anybody you got your eye on?
there is this one guy.
cute? -Very.
details.
I'm on bed rest and being denied sex. I need some details.
well he's a good guy.
I mean, I don't know him that well or anything, but you can just tell, you know?
he's a good guy, and I need a good guy.
any dates? -I don't know, I don't know.
I mean, he's feels like he wants to ask me out, but I don't know. It's like there's something holding him back or well, go after him.
get yours.
and then tell me all about it. -Okay.
if something happens, you will be the first to know.
I hear the waves are 2 to 4 feet, great shape.
one of the guys in the office surfs. Said it was great out there today.
maybe. I don't know.
can't see it from here.
I know. I'm sorry.
when I thought that one day, I could be out there doing it myself, it was fun to think about.
but now -come on, Annie.
we both know the truth.
I'm gonna die in this hospital.
you signed off on the injunction.
now you're telling me you just want me to let her die?
I was doing my job. I was following the law.
But? -Maybe Cooper's right.
keeping her alive isn't the Same as save her life.
look, I am sorry Annie can't go to school or go surfing, but is the chance to do that for a month or two, is that worth giving up the chance at living past 13?
she's got nothing left in her, Noah, not even the will to fight you.
so maybe you should ask yourself, who are you doing this for?
she still hasn't done the amnio.
maybe you should just do that charm thing you people do.
you're charming.
look, I'm thinking about it, okay?
in psychological circles, we call that a stall.
uh, hey, Jill had a very tough session today.
I was wondering if you could do something to help her relax.
Hey, Jill.
don't touch me!
Jill, it's me. It's pete.
focus on me. Look at me. It's pete.
okay.
okay? okay, take a deep breath.
you're here. You're okay.
she's resting. -Thanks.
violet, you have to stop.
she's traumatized. -By the attack.
She--she's afraid that if she doesn't finish what she started, then this thing will keep haunting her.
so I'm--I'm gonna support her in that.
Jill is a wreck. She's falling apart.
she was happy. She had a life.
he came in and--and ok a piece of it away
her contentment, her security.
and until she sees this guy locked up and paying for what he did, she's not gonna move past it.
I hope you're right.
you're here late.
Yeah, well you know, babies don't tell time.
besides, you're, uh, you're here, too.
do you think we push?
as, um, doctors, do you think we push too hard?
I don't know. I mean well, I have this patient now.
she's pregnant and just just trying to get her through it so she can have a healthy baby, I push, you know, for patients like her, because she needs me to.
what about when they don't need you to?
are you okay?
I think I've been pushing too hard. I don't know.
just just, um, just sit here with me?
okay.
do you realize that we don't even know each other's names?
you're right.
I'm Addison Montgomery.
I have to, uh, I have to go. I have a patient.
nice to meet you.
Hey, uh, Betsey's sick. Her school just called.
uh, do you mind if I duck out for, like, an hour? Heather can't get her.
uh, no, that's fine. Go ahead.
what are you doing?
doesn't this trip look perfect?
for who?
you do see what you're doing, right?
Yes, I am helping. -You're avoiding.
okay, archer broke your heart.
and now you're throwing yourself into Sam's life so you don't have to pick up and start yours.
don't take this the wrong way, but when was the last time you went on a date?
Oh, come on.
maybe if you spent all this time and effort you're spending on Sam and Sonya on yourself it might be more rewarding.
you here to force other procedure on her or...
I won't push the surgery anymore.
if she doesn't want it, I won't push.
what about the judge?
I told him I reevaluated my position.
I just wanted to help her.
so once it's out?
it's not easy to get back in.
if Annie were to have a problem?
we might not be able to get medication into her fast enough.
you do understand? This is it.
you sure, Annie? -I'm sure.
it's all right, mom.
I promise, it's all right. Everything's gna be okay.
you'll see.
I'm gonna see the ocean.
you're gonna see the ocean.
good news, Morgan. Amnio was normal.
there are no genetic abnormalities. The baby is perfectly healthy.
thank God! Yay!
I can't wait to tell my husband.
he should be here any minute.
Oh, there he is. Hi, honey.
Oh, uh, this is the wonderful doctor I've been telling you so much about
nice to meet you, Dr. Montgomery. -Nice to meet you.
you're gonna do fine.
I don't know if I can do this.
I know that you're scared, but I also know that this is something that you want to do.
what if I can't?
Jill look at him.
look at him.
tell me what he did to you.
I heard his voice telling me not to turn around and...
no, I- I can't.
keep breathing, just like we worked on.
he had a gun.
he grabbed me and the next thing I knew, I felt a blow across my ce.
and then he hit me with the gun over and over and over, until my head slammed into the pavement.
that's right. That's right. That's what he did to you.
now why are you here, Jill?
that man robbed me.
he didn't just steal my car and my money.
he stole my sense of security.
he stole my ability to sleep at night.
he stole my sense of self-control.
so I came here today to get them back.
I'd say you're ready.
you should've seen the smile on her face when she got on that board.
it's her birthday, and it just keeps creeping up on me...
that it'll be her last.
it's a good one.
it's what he wanted. She's living.
I should've trusted you to know what Jill could handle, to know that she'd remember when she was ready.
thank you.
you wanted to see me? -Yes, uh, both of you.
wait, wait.
did you？- No.
no. I- I- I didn't.
right now, in my mind, the baby is the bug.
and, uh, I've gotten used to the bug.
I'm actually liking the bug.
and I--I'm afraid if I start seeing it with a pete head or a sheldon head or
I know myself, and I know that I-I--I'm not ready to do this.
what about us?
if you want to know anything, ask.
if you want to be included, come--both of you. Or neither of you.
I understand if you want to walk away, and I'm sorry.
but I know that this is the best way to do it.
for you.
you're alone here.
you have Cooper and the baby.
but you're all alone.
and you don't have to be.
cat got your tongue?
I do not understand you.
what, Cooper? -Annie bishop.
you went to noah behind my back. I just bumped into him.
why didn't you tell me you helped him change his mind?
Charlotte, you did a good thing, a thing that makes me love you even more.
why-- I don't need you to love me even more!
I slept with archer, and you forgive me.
you are good.
you are the good one. You do good things.
you and... it makes me sick.
you lovin' me, it makes me literally sick to my stomach.
I slept with somebody else.
I screwed archer's brains out, and you forgive it?
who does that?
so, see, you're the good one, and I'm the bad one, and I don't want credit for saving a little girl's life.
I don't want it.
you need to forgive yourself. -Damn it, stop loving me.
you need to forgive yourself. -Just stop loving me!
no, no. I will not stop loving you.
no.
I'm sorry.
Hi.
look at this. Sonya and I got to make our own private label.
Oh, well, now that's what I call a vacation. -Thanks.
so what do you think I should do next with Sonya?
all right? What's the, uh, what's the plan?
uh you--you know, there is no plan.
Yeah, travel agency's closed. I'm finished.
what? You were helping me out. It was fun.
uh, yeah, that's the problem.
you shouldn't be having fun with me.
you should be having fun with her.
and, uh, I should be having some fun of my own.
Annie's 13.
good job.
the jury found him guilty.
very good job.
will you talk to the bug?
I thought you hated that.
just talk to the bug, Cooper.
Hello, bug.
hello. This is your uncle Cooper speaking.
and I look forward to seeing you in a couple of months.
Hey, ready to go? I got us a 7: 30 reservation, what's wrong?
you don't call out your ex-wife's name out of habit, not if it's working not if it's right.
well, do you do you want to be with her?
no.
no.
what she and I had a best friend and you and I...
we're never gonna get there. -I'm sorry.
Yeah. Me, too.
this is a mistake.- Just be here.
all right. But still, it is a mistake.
all right, I'll be over here.
I wasn't going to come. -But you did.
thank you.
what do you want, Noah?
Oh, I just, um, I just wanted to say...
I just wanted to tell you that the first time we talked,
I was just a flattered married guy.
then the second time, I was-- I was playing with fire.
and I got attached.
I got attached in a way I didn't expect.
I didn't mean to, I didn't plan
I have been where you are one step away rom doing something really stupid.
I've done really stupid.
don't take the step.
what if I want to take the step?
what if the step is a- all I can think about?
she's my patient.
you think I don't know that?
finishing or starting?
finishing.
Oh, no. Just, uh, breakfast.
we won't discuss it now, but I am looking forward to hearing where you are on my offer.
we're still having dinner tonight?
Oh, I'll be there.
good.
he's meeting with everyone-- Everyone except me.
you have a contract.
he can't push you out.
I'm trying to talk to you about what's going on.
Violet--Again.
grasshopper!
Cooper. - Grasshopper!
you grasshoppered me, right?
Yeah, it's the baby? It's the baby?
it's the bug? The bug--Okay.
okay, okay, so now we're gonna breathe?
okay, we're gonna breathe now.
Hey, I know, I know. This is your case.
I am not hovering. I just wanted to see how she's doing.
we're gonna find out.
this is it, Pete.
it's happening.
not happening today.
no cervical dilation.
you're not in labor, Violet.
what? I-I am a doctor I know labor when I feel labor.
you--you know psychosis.
but labor, not so much.
he's right. I gotta go.
I gotta go prep another patient.
no, no, no!
this chicken is cooked.
this bug is ready to be served.
this baby boy has got to get out of me. I am a week overdue.
violet. Violet, shh.
Hey. You just...You have to give him a little more time.
he'll be here.
the baby! Is it here?
it's a false alarm.
Just--Just...
I brought this. Kids love pigs.
that's really sweet, sheldon. I'm sure he's gonna love it.
well, you two are having fun.
Oh, we're just comparing notes--Same checkups, same implantations, same symptoms.
I'll tell you, why don't you come on back, and we'll go over your C. V.S. results?
and, zoe, you'll be next.
take your time. I'm waiting on my husband.
Bye.
God, that feels good, whatever that is.
good. Good. Do it more.
so you're feeling better?
what do you mean?
since your loss.
my loss?
the baby. The miscarriage.
Oh, that.
no, I'm fine. I'm doing great.
so uh, Dr. Turner's been helping you through your grief?
grief? What grief? There's no grief.
I mean, there was, but--But there isn't anymore.
I just changed my way of thinking.
it's a celebration, really.
I made life.
I mean, yes, the baby died, but that doesn't change the fact that life was made, which is the real miracle, making life.
I mean, labor's hard.
it--it hurts and--And-- And at least I don't have to go through that.
Katie, I'm really glad you're feeling better, but recovery is an ongoing process, and it's important for you to remember to follow the regimen that dr. Turner and I laid out for you.
that means taking your medications, because with your history of mental health issues, you don't want to backslide into delusions.
look at me, dr. Wilder. I am smiling again.
so he's fine?
I keep calling it a "he" because of Vic.
he really wanted a boy.
you know, someone to carry on the family name.
not that he wouldn't have loved a girl, too.
I like to think he's watching from heaven.
Oh, he is.
this was your dream, right?
this is what you and vic wanted.
he'd want you to have this baby.
uh, I'll--I'll be right back in one second, okay? Just give me a minute.
what's up?
okay, that's it. Cerclage is out.
hard part's over. You can deliver anytime now.
Oh, dizzy.
Oh, that's, uh, probably a mild stress reaction.
just stay here for a couple of hours and rest until it subsides.
I'm gonna go back to the hospital, check on some patients, and I'll pick you up in a few hours, okay?
thanks for, um, for everything.
I saw that.
I saw the way you looked at him, the way he looked at you.
Morgan, I-- - Are you sleeping with Noah?
morgan just asked me point-Blank if I was sleeping with Noah.
I mean, I told her no, I'm not, because I'm not.
I mean, I'm barely in the same room since
Addison. - What?
I-I was just in with Amelia Sawyer, and I started going over the C. V.S. results, and the baby tested positive for the beta thalassemia trait.
that's just a marker.
Yeah, I know, but amelia isn't a carrier.
and neither was her husband. We screened.
and--and so I-I checked the I. V.F. records to see who else I implanted that day.
I implanted Zoe salter that morning.
Zoe is a carrier for beta thalassemia.
Oh, my god.
how? - I don't know.
how? - I don't know how.
I don't know. But...
Amelia's embryo is inside of Zoe, and zoe's embryo is inside of Amelia.
they're carrying each other's baby.
you switched them?
this is a disaster.
wait a minute. Why assume it was my fault?
you're the one who delivers the syringes for the implantations.
you've been walking around here unfocused, not giving a damn.
there are steps to the process, okay?
multiple steps.
and in the end, Naomi injects them.
I-I'm not saying it was you.
I'm not saying it was you.
I'm just saying, we don't know.
Hey, he's right.
I am the doctor.
ultimately, this is my responsibility.
but listen, we should be focused on these women and--And not pointing fingers.
I ca--I cannot imagine what it feels like.
it's hard enough to carry your own baby.
imagine carrying somebody else's.
I suppose they could decide to terminate, start over.
no, this is Amelia's last embryo with her dead husband's sperm.
this--this is it. There are no do-overs.
this is a nightmare-- Lawsuits, our reputation.
I'm gonna call our lawyer, start trying to do damage control.
all right, I--I'll call Duncan.
Yeah, medical malpractice is his specialty, and--And he's someone we can trust.
he's someone you can trust.
I'll go ahead and call him.
I-I said I'd call him.
as head of the practice, I think the call should come from me.
I'll call him on the way to the hospital.
this isn't my baby?
how can this not be my baby?
I know this is difficult to digest, and I wish I didn't have to tell you this.
words cannot convey how sorry I am, and...
there's no explanation I can offer you that can excuse what's happened.
I can't believe this.
this isn't happening.
we've spent two years trying to get pregnant, and now
this isn't my baby?
you're telling me that this isn't...
this isn't my pregnancy?
I saw the Waddler walking into her office.
I assume the grasshopper was a false alarm.
I should've called you.
I got caught up with some patients, and, uh, we got some stuff going on here.
you'll make it up to me.
I need you to be my beard.
william left again without talking to me, but I found out where he's gonna be later.
I'll bump into him, start a conversation, impress him.
stalk him.
what do I ever ask from you, Coop?
a little slap, a little tickle, repeat as necessary.
I even let you live with another woman.
so you want to make an issue of this, or you want to help me?
what time should I be there?
it's you, isn't it? You're-- You're carrying my baby.
Amelia, maybe let's give Zoe some time
I know this is so awful, but at least it's you.
we can do it, right?
we can do this?
I'll respect your wishes about the baby, about everything.
and I'll trust you with mine.
Amelia, I c-- I can't.
we have other embryos stored.
we're gonna start over.
no, that's my baby. You can't...
I don't have any other eggs.
I'm carrying your baby.
I don't want that.
we want you to fix this mistake.
what? You want me to kill the baby?
I can't do that. You can't do that.
wait a minute.
why don't we all just go back into my office and discuss this?
no, I just want to go home.
well, I want a lot of things. Please, please.
I won't do this. I will not end this pregnancy.
and if you do anything to that baby, I'm gonna have this baby, and I'm gonna keep it!
I saw Katie this morning.
I'm worried she's off her meds.
Katie? Oh, no. She's been really compliant.
I mean, she's cheerful, which is a concern, but
not cheerful. She's euphoric.
she's talking about her miscriage with excitement.
well, we have a session this afternoon.
I'll talk to her about it then. Thanks.
she still hasn't given me an answer to my proposal.
this is awkward, between us.
I mean, I like you. I do, Pete.
are you gonna propose to me?
you-- You're funny.
I bet she likes that.
I guess...Whichever way this turns out, I'll know.
I'll know I tried.
we have done nothing wrong.
nothing biblical anyway.
well, there's coveting.
okay, coveting.
but that's not the bad sin.
there are no good sins.
are you even religious? - No, not
then why are we talking about sins?
you're the one who brought up the bible.
I did not.
it doesn't matter who brought it up, okay? Because we're both going to hell.
I feel guilty. I feel awful.
which is why I should tell her.
you know, this...
this will destroy her life.
but at least it'll be honest, and she deserves the truth.
we could be together.
think about that.
we could be together.
okay?
okay.
I covet you.
I...Covet you.
I'm not the kind of guy who fights.
I just--I just don't see the point to it.
and the times I've tried it, you hurt your knuckles, you don't really feel better, it doesn't solve anything.
and I guess I'm, at heart, just a pacifist, bcause I think fighting is stupid.
I think war is wrong, and taking up arms for some cause just lacks nobility in today's world.
so-- - Pete, Pete.
I'm not the kinda guy who fights, but I should've fought for you.
I should've fought for you, Violet.
and I don't really know how else to say it except I want your kid, whether it's mine or not.
and I want your body, whether it's pregnant or not.
and I-I want your heart, whether I haveo fight for it or not.
and I should've fought for it, but I was confused and angry and--And scared. So...
I am fighting now, because I love you.
and I think we can be something.
I think we can be a family.
I'm f-Fat and overdue and tireand cranky.
Violet-- - No, no.
no, Pete. I'm sorry.
this is not what I want.
a year ago, I was stalking a man who wanted nothing to do with me, and now I'm turning two good men down.
do I hate myself?
is it m-Me? Is it?
am I the problem?
do you think you're the problem?
Oh, that's very therapeutic, making the patient answer her own question.
and now I'm avoid it.
okay, do you think one of them--Pete or Sheldon.
do you think that could work?
you have to answer that one.
I don't know, Cooper!
Dr. Turner. Hi.
no one was up front. It's time for my appointment, right?
I think your focus needs to be on damage control.
first, you want to mitigate pain and suffering.
so approach each woman separately about a settlement.
offer to cover all medical expenses and make a large, lump-Sum payment in exchange for releasing all claims and signing a confidentiality agreement.
you need to show these women that someone has paid for the mistake.
you need to fire Dell.
no.
no, no, Dell-- Dell is like family, and--And we don't even know that this is his fault.
you want to defend him? Fine.
but I do not believe that this was you.
dell is family, but if saving the practice means cutting him loose, then...
are you firing me?
no, but for now, you're behind a desk, phones and mail only.
but I-I have patients.
I'm--I'm--I'm delivering Violet's baby.
it's just for now.
so I spoke with dr. Wilder, and, um, we have some concerns.
is it a boy or a girl, your baby?
Katie, your-Your medication is a very important part of managing your delusional disorder.
it's important that you keep taking it.
does she kick much?
I'm sorry.
you were voicing your concerns, and I wasn't answering.
Yes, yes, I am taking my meds.
I don't want things to go back to the way they were, dr. Turner.
it was crazy. I was crazy.
I'm taking my meds and I'm feeling great.
can I touch it?
uh, no, I-I don't think that's a good idea.
Oh, the baby's moving.
Oh, it's a smart baby. You can just tell.
is it a boy or a girl?
so you agree, she's of her meds?
Yeah, I think she's off her meds.
I-I think she's lying about it.
I-I don't have any proof. I'd like to 51-50 her.
I just--I-I-- I think she's on the edge.
I got a bad feeling about this.
well, you can't commit someone on a feeling.
but it really creeped me out, the way she was looking at me.
Pete's right. You can't commit someone on a feeling.
all right. What if the delusionsare amping up again?
what if she's just happy?
she's done grieving.
I-I know happiness when I see it.
what?
you know happiness?
when it's offered to you?
we are talking about Katie.
she may just be happy.
she wasn't happy.
I know happy.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
don't. No. Uh, you-- You didn't do anything.
I thought.
well, I thought I saw something.
but now I-I realize I was just jumping to conclusions. And, um, you reassured me, and I trust you.
I went by the birthing suite and...
can we talk a minute?
Noah-- - No, it's okay, Addison.
um, I...
I insulted her this morning after you left.
I was feeling insecure about you, and I insulted her.
I just hope she'll still deliver our baby.
you didn't do anything.
of course I'm still going to deliver your baby.
Addison-- - Family is the most important thing, and nothing should get in the way of that.
William, I am...
I am so flattered by the offer, but something happened today, a very serious medical error.-- And my practice is under fire.
so I'm...
I'm no longer a good candidate.
the measure of a pern is not the mistakes they make.
it's how they respond to them.
I want you.
I guess I'm just gonna have to sell you a little harder.
may I get you another drink while you wait?
Noah was gonna leave his wife for me.
and I stopped him.
and I hate that I stopped him. And I hate myself for feeling that way.
who would've thought that you'd turn out to be the nice guy?
not violet.
congratulations, mama, on popping out that baby.
you did pop out that baby, right?
cause that's the only possible reason I can fathom for uncle Coop to have left me sitting alone like a fool at a restaurant last night.
Oh, Charlotte, I'm...
I'm--I'm sorry. My fault I was a wreck.
clearly.
you and I need to talk.
uh, I...
I can't talk about this. I have a patient in crisis right now.
I can't have this conversation. I'm sorry.
what's going on? Is there a problem?
the problem, Sam, is that your ex-wife is trying to steal my job.
Amelia can't do it, not yet.
so I'm gonna have her talk to Violet instead.
nai, trust me. It would be much better if you would just.
Naomi, we went over this.
I am not gonna force her to talk to an attorney if she's not ready to do it.
well, I think you should bring in another attorney.
I-I--I'm not trying to put you in the middle, Duncan.
I-- I'll call you later.
I hate this.
I hate being on opposite sides.
Yeah, well, you may hate it, but your side always wins.
this isn't about winning, Naomi.
I've been offered Charlotte King's job at pacific wellcare center.
what? That's crazy.
I mean, you know that, right?
I thought so at first-- - Right?
I thought so at first, too. I did.
but, Addison, I'm floundering.
this whole year, just losing the practice and--And sam renting out the fourth floor, I mean, I'm trying to move forward. I am.
but I-I...
I haven't, not really.
and this offer, it's exciting.
nai, you are my best friend.
and with everything going on, Addison...
me leaving would show that you did something.
this is...Your practice.
not anymore.
Where's Betsey?
tell me she's okay.
Yeah, she's fine. She's, um...
she's a motel with a friend.
that's it? You took my daughter in the middle of the night.
you--you took her, and--And I had no idewhere you were, if she was okay, and you just...
you're high, aren't you?
St. Louis was really bad.
I need money.
you think I'm...
you think I'm gonna give you money for drugs?
I don't need a lecture, okay?
I need $10, 000.
you're insane.
I mean, even if I had that kind of money, after everything you've done, you think I'd give it to you?
if you give me the money, I'll give you Betsey.
maybe I'm not meant to be a mother.
maybe I'm not meant to be happy.
I-I-I don't--I don't believe that's true.
I think everybody's meant to be happy.
well, it's easy for you to say. You're about to have a baby.
this isn't what you want. I know that, Amelia.
but you could carry this child and give it up, and then become a mother another way.
Naomi's right.
there are other ways.
my happiness?
it's right here.
it's right in front of me.
I can't fathom letting it go.
maybe you and Sheldon are right.
maybe I don't know how to be happy. - Violet
for a long time, I've been at baseline-- Just alive, breathing, heart beating.
happy just seemed really far away.
and that was the best I could do.
but I'm having a baby, Pete.
I am making a person, which is a really optimistic thing to do.
I mean, that is really happy, which scares me a lot.
but the point is, the point-- - Violet
maybe I don't know how to be happy, but I want to learn.
I want to be happy, Pete.
and you...You so often make me happy.
so.
so I know that I said no, but if you were still willing to fight for me, then I am willing to be fought for.
except it really wouldn't be much of a fight, because you'd win
be quiet.
I have to give Sheldon an answer.
I don't want to have any secrets anymore.
and then I think I'm just gonna go home and sleep, bcause I have not been sleeping at a...
what did I say about being quiet?
I-I forgot to tell you that I love you.
I think it was my fault-- Zoe and Amelia.
I checked the calendar, and, uh, my lawyer called that day to tell me that he couldn't find Heather and Betsey.
and it was killing me, and, uh...
what?
Heather's back.
she showed up strung out.
she'll--she'll give me my daughter if I give her $10, 000.
you can't buy your daughter.
I-I can't let her run with my child.
so then you come running to Naomi after you blamed her for your mistake?
Sam, he apologized.
of course he apologized.
he wants your money.
it's not your problem.
I'm sorry I asked.
dell-- - No, it's-- I'm sorry I asked.
what is wrong with you?
no, what is wrong with you?
you do not buy children, you don't help drug addicts kill themselves, and you do not take the fall for Dell and then flee to
to work for the enemy!
how could you not tell me?
we were supposed to be partners here.
you're the one who wanted distance.
I said we couldn't be best friends.
I didn't tell you to leave.
you were right.
I mean, look-- Look at how you reacted to Duncan yesterday, Sam.
that's--that's not business.
that's you not liking the fact that I'm dating Duncan.
I don't like you dating him!
you know what? But you don't get a say.
why do you get a say?
we-- We're--We're not married, Sam.
why should it matter?
because I'm still in love with you!
Why? What?
what do you--What
what, is--Is that supposed to make me want to stay or is that supposed to make me want to go?
you okay?
I will be.
how did you get my address?
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you at home.
I know it crosses a boundary. It's just, uh, I don't want to lie to you.
you've helped me so much.
I needed to talk to you.
I needed to let you know that I know.
what? What is it?
you have my baby.
and I want it back.
Yes, dr. Turner?
what was in the syringe?
it doesn't matter what was in the syringe.
what matters is, you can't move from the neck down.
did you know you can order drugs from other countries and have them delivered right to your door?
the internet is amazing.
Katie, we need to talk about this.
you've done a very dangerous thing, so we should discuss your options.
I'm not listening to you anymore, dr. Turner.
I'm getting my baby out of your body and bringing him home where he I belongs.
what are you gonna do, cut him out of my body?
Oh, you're scared.
I can tell. But don't worry.
I read all about it on the internet.
the internet--It's amazing.
you can even order surgical supplies.
thank you for coming.
martin didn't want me to, but he doesn't know you.
I do.
and I wanted you to know that I'm not a monster.
I just...
this is my life, and I have dreams, and I have one chance to make them happen, and I can't. I-I...
I can't turn what I've always wanted into a nightmare.
for me, that baby inside you, I thought was my last chance.
only...
maybe it's not.
I want that baby.
but I can't make you carry him, so...
maybe...
maybe the reason this all happened is--Is that this is my new chance.
you want to carry your own child. I understand.
but this baby, I-I can't get rid of it.
I love him.
we all have dreams, and sometimes they get complicated.
and so sometimes we have to stop and let go of one dream so that we can move forward with another one.
I can't.
I can't let you keep my child.
I'm sorry.
I know you're meeting with other doctors.
and while Naomi Bennett is an amazing fertility specialist, her track record at running a practice...
this is not about dr. Bennett.
you're right.
it's about whether or not I can give you want you want.
if you want to make this the next Mayo, Cleveland, Palo Alto clinic, I can do that.
Really?
these are letters of intent from Wilson stafford, Ssanjay finamore and Joy hopkins, each one, the best in their field.
all it takes is your signature, and I can have them working for us tomorrow.
well, I'll give this some thought.
impressive speech.
don't try and get in my good graces.
I'm sorry about last night, and I know I haven't been giving you enough.
but listen to this-- Things are gonna change.
violet is moving in with Pete.
every time you had a choice, you chose her.
now she doesn't need you anymore.
well, you know what? Neither do I.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't. I...
I just...
she loves you. I-I couldn't...
I understand.
I can't be this person, you know, a person who does this horrible thing to another woman.
I know.
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm sorry.
Oh, we can't.
we can't.
I love you.
if you want me to walk away, I'll walk away.
if you want me to stay.
it's Morgan.
she's in labor.
Katie, I know you can remember what happened to your baby.
try.
try and think.
my baby died.
that's what you want me to say, right?
that's the correct answer?
what do you think the correct answer is?
my baby didn't die.
yours died, so you took mine.
you stole my baby.
but your baby was a girl.
mine is a boy.
there's a boy in here.
I know it sounds crazy. I do.
but I'm not crazy. I'm a normal person.
I believe it's true. This is my baby.
and if I don't follow my instincts and I let you take my baby...
Katie, Katie, look at me. Look at me.
I believe you that you think this is your baby.
but I think this is my baby, too.
it has grown in me for months, and I--And I love this baby.
and I know you love this baby, too.
so if you cut, then the baby might get hurt.
and we both love this baby too much to hurt it, right?
Yes.
okay, so let's not do this, not right now.
it kicked.
it's calling me.
my baby's calling me.
no, no.
no.
Katie, if you would just wait, maybe...
no, no.
I told you, I'm not crazy. I know I can't wait.
I've attacked you in your home. I've drugged you.
you think they'll give me my baby after that?
Katie-- -Shut up!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Katie, katie-- - I'm sorry.
Katie, please, please, please.
Oh, god. It'll be better once the baby's out.
once the baby's out, I'll be gone, and you won't have to worry about me anymore.
I'll work fast.
Katie, please, please.
please.
your family, whatever that means...
if you're single, if you're married, if--If you have kids, or if you want kids, your family should be the most important thing.
and your family is the most important thing to us...
Dr. Bennett.
I've been walking around thinking about Amelia and about the baby, and I-I can't let her keep my child.
just the thought of it, but maybe you're right about moving forward.
and so I'm thinking maybe I can carry Amelia's baby and she can carry mine.
I'm upset with you, Dell, for what you did and for the position that you put the practice in, for how you've been acting
Sam, just-- - Let me finish.
but I know that you've been hurting.
and I know that when you've lost somebody that you love...
I know that you need to do whatever it takes to get them back.
10000.0
get your daughter back.
our baby's coming.
he's really coming.
how are you feeling?
good. Everything's good, right, dr. Montgomery?
uh, everything looks fine, yeah.
let's just s how dilate you are.
this list...
impressive.
almost perfect.
but if you brought all these doctors here, how long do you suppose they'd last?
your staff doesn't like you, Charlotte.
you use 'em like pawns.
the best work is done by people who are inspired, who push themselves because they--They want to be a part of something larger.
and you think that Naomi Bennett, or anyone else, is gonna be able to do that for you?
the plans I have for this practice require someone with a heart, Charlotte.
daddy!
Where's the money, Dell?
you said you'd give me the money. I need the money.
you're not gonna see her again.
it's okay.
look, I have the money, but I'm not gonna give it to you, okay?
and she's not going anywhere.
you don't have custody. I do.
you're strung out, Heather.
so I can pick up the phone and I can call D. C.F. S.or I can pick up the phone and I can call the police, and we can have them come down here.
you tell me.
look, I am not giving you this money to let you kill yourself, because I may hate you right now, but I love her, and you're her mother, and I am not letting go of my daughter.
so come say good-bye to your daughter.
come say good-bye to Betsey.
come say good-bye.
Baby...You're gonna have to stay with daddy for a little while, okay?
I love you.
I'm gonna get her back.
mommy!
come here. Come here.
it's okay.
violet isn't answering the phone.
she came down. I was with a patient.
but she left me a note.
she said it was important, you know, and I-I got the sense that, uh...
have you heard anything from her?
no, not in the last few hours.
well, it sounded like she had an answer to my proposal.
I'm sure she'll call you back.
you know.
you know the answer.
you should talk to Violet.
take good care of her, of them.
okay, uh...
maybe I shouldn't have said what I said about how I feel.
that's my issue.
it's not yours, and--And I can deal with it.
but this...
this is our practice.
we built it.
I can be okay with--With--With you moving on, but not...
not with you leaving.
you are the heart of this place, Naomi.
I took the job, Sam.
that's a cop-out.
I do not accept it.
it's what I have to do.
Oh, that was a strong one.
you're doing great.
you okay? - Please don't.
just don't.
okay, I should've asked for drugs.
is it too late for drugs?
I'm sorry, uh, Morgan. It is.
Oh, here comes another one,Noah!
you're doing great. You're doing fine.
Oh, I can't believe we're finally getting to...
after the babies that died, we're actually gonna be a family.
um, Morgan Gellman is in the birthing suite.
I need you to go deliver her baby.
What--what about no patient can...
just deliver the baby.
I, uh...I can't.
and, uh, I'll be here if you need anything, but I need you to go do this.
okay, okay, okay, okay.
um, hey, Betsey, I've got some work to do, okay?
but Addison is right here.
hello. - I need you Cooper.
Yeah, I just got to Violet's, so Cooper, I need you. I got fired.
okay, I'll-- I'll be right there.
he's gone.
I'm gonna get started.
transverse incision...
what?
don't cut there. It's too high.
you know no matter where I cut, you won't survive, right?
I know.
it's for the baby.
if you cut there, you'll cut the baby.
I know. I'm a doctor.
I'm your doctor, Katie.
tell me what to do.
measure two fingers above my pelvic bone.
now what?
after...
after you get the baby out, you cut that cord right away.
you cut it right away.
you keep him warm, and you make sure to clear his mouth and his nose.
you promise me you'll do that?
I promise.
tell me.
make a clean slice on the horizontal.
you're gonna have to cut through the muscle to get to the baby.
I just want to say, I think under different circumstances, we could've been friends.
don't you think?
Yeah. Friends.
Oh, the--The range of movement is amazing.
you think that's good. Hey, Pete.
toss it to Colin.
come on. Don't be afraid to put a little heat on it. I'm pretty good.
nice catch.
I connected the arm directly to Colin's nervous system.
the brain thinks "catch the ball," and the hand does it. The guys in my unit would freak.
Oh, were-- were you in Iraq?
afghanistan.
feel free to use words like "genius" or "brilliant" at will.
I don't have to 'cause you just did.
it was really nice to meet you, and, uh, good luck with your arm.
you okay?
no, something-- Oh, it burns.
help him, or he's gonna pull out the neuron connectors.
you implanted a bolt in his arm?
osseous integration. It's the only way to carry the weight.
I know what it is. It's also illegal.
in this country. I sent him to Sweden.
okay, it's infected. He's burning up. We've gotta get him to the hospital.
okay, well, Maya's in your office. She wouldn't even look a in the car on the way over here, and now you got Sam and Naomi in the conference room. Do you want to tell me what's going on?
no, I can't, Dell. I wish I could, but I can't.
guys, um, very pregnant woman squatting up and down in the hallway?
not mine. - She's mine. Lynn McDonald.
she's committed to natural childbirth. She's been in labor for two days.
her water finally broke last night.
this isn't working. Do you have anything spicy in the fridge?
like maybe-- Maybe a chimichanga, huh?
that'll speed up the labor, right?
Yeah, I'll order you something.
okay, baby, come out.
and come out.
And...Come out.
well, let's go check out your progress.
and come out.
okay, Addison. What's this important case that, uh...
Hey, Maya girl. What's up?
wait. Did you have a half a day today?
no, no, no. - Was I supposed to
no, no, no. I always keep the half days in my calendar.
I keep 'em in my calendar, too.
it's not a half day.
Maya has something that she needs to tell you.
I...
I...
Maya's pregnant.
no, she's not.
how?
when did you start having sex
wait. No. No, okay.
this is--This isn't possible. We discussed this.
discussed birth control.
your-- Two doctors. Both your parents are doctors. How could you be pregnant?
how could this be happening?
what were-- What were you thinking?
Hey, where you going? Our daughter just told us that-- that-- that she is pregnant.
we need to talk about this.
I can't. - Mom
Naomi, we are her parents.
I can't.
Naomi walked away.
our daughter is pregnant, and Naomi walked away.
I know. She's in shock. She's dealing with it.
I'm supposed to just wait until she decides that she's ready?
we need to talk to our daughter now.
Sam, this isn't the first time I've delivered this kind of news.
people need time. Give...
give Naomi some time.
Colin, you have a severe infection.
how long has it been hurting?
a month.
I thought it was normal pain.
and I was afraid that if it was the bolt, then I couldn't keep the arm.
well, Dr. Wilder feels the bolt should come out.
no. Can't we do more antibiotics or something?
well, what do you say, Dr. Wilder? You specialize in infectious disease.
you know alternative treatments. What are his options?
there has to be something up your sleeve since you have two of them.
there are experimental protocols, but the F.D.A. hasn't completed safety studies, and there are reports of severe side effects. I'm sorry.
the bolt is the source of the infection, and the safest thing to do is remove it before the infection spreads.
before I deployed, I got engaged.
we wrote letters, we planned the whole thing, right down to the dance that we're going to do, which requires me to dip her to the floor.
now I'm living up to my part of this. I'm going to hold her in my arms
both arms-- And I'm going to dance with her the way I promised.
you came back alive. You're healthy and alive.
I know you planned for more, but I cannot treat you in a way that will jeopardize your health.
Dr. Wilder
Colin, this infection could kill you. I know that's not what your fiance wants.
why do they do this?
why does the hospital keep sending me samples?
it's like "gaslight, but with baby stuff.
Gaslight"?
famous movie?
never saw it.
Ingrid Bergman. Her husband tries to drive her crazy.
uh, when the Petermans get here, will you put them in exam room three?
I'm using exam room three.
Oh, actually room three is for pediatrics.
and I have a 7-year-old with a urinary tract infection.
it's-- It's about a marriage that ends badly.
Gaslight.
violet Turner.
uh, here's the situation-- I don't want any more baby stuff.
so no diaper cream samples.
I've-- I've called, I've e-mailed, I've mail-mailed for the past six months, but the hospital just keeps sending it.
most new mothers appreciate our little freebies.
well, I am not a new mother.
how old is your baby?
that's not what I meant. I am not a new or an old or any kind of mother.
I don't have a baby anymore.
Oh, my god. I'm so sorry for your loss.
they're god's littlest angels, the ones we lose.
could you just get the form?
of course.
I'm sorry, too, for your loss.
Oh, no, no. It's just-- I- I was just
no, no, no. You don't have to explain. I- I get it. I-- I lost my wife today.
Oh, my god.
a sentence you never think you're gonna have to say, you know, I lost-- I lost my wife.
and, uh, every time you say it, you think you're not gonna be able to breathe, and it's like-- It's like somebody shot you or something.
and then I-- and then I hear that you lost your child-- Your baby
and it's-- it, like, gives it perspective, you know?
it-- it's-- it's-- it helps me to know you lost your child.
and I know that's a horrible thing to say to you.
my wife's dead, and I've offended you, and I'm sorry...
for your loss.
no, no. I'm-- I'm sorry for your loss.
they gave me this bag with her...Belongings. It's...
it's funny. I thought there'd be more to take home.
do you need...
can I help you? Is there anything I can do?
uh, no. no, no. I- I'm just waiting. A friend's picking me up, so well...
it was nice to meet you.
I'm Nathan Pilsman.
violet Turner.
it's nice to meet you, Violet Turner.
well, not nice, but...
it's nice.
you can't walk.
you're black. What game are we playing?
the day that you found out...
when they told you that, uh, your legs-- that you would-- you would never walk again, that must have been the worst day of your life.
how did you deal with it?
why would you assume that that was my worst day?
losing my legs changed my life, but, uh, it certainly didn't ruin it.
there's a period of adjustment, but...
you deal with it.
you're full of crap.
Naomi, what-- what are you doing here?
mom, what are you doing?
what's going on?
Naomi, what is going on?
I need you to give Maya an abortion.
what? - Nay.
mom, no. I don't want an abortion.
I don't care what you want.
but, mom
give her an abortion.
I can't believe I slapped her.
I hit my child.
you were upset, clearly.
it's not an easy thing to deal with.
I know, I know, but I...
well, I can't-- I lost it.
but c- can you believe her?
can you believe her saying no to me?
what?
you ordered her to have an abortion.
so putting aside the fact that you are personally against it
you can't make someone have an abortion, nay.
no, no, no. This is-- this-- this is not up for discussion.
I think it needs to be.
well, you know what? If you're not gonna do it, that's fine. I will find another doctor who will.
okay, I don't even know who I'm talking to right now. This is not you.
it's the opposite of you.
you-- you give people babies, and whether or not I agree with your stand on this issue, this isn't you.
don't do something now that you will hate yourself for later.
do you hate yourself for your abortions?
either of you?
no, I don't hate myself. But I do think about it.
it stays with you even if you do it for the right reasons, and it is not a casual decision that you can make for Maya.
this--this is my family.
you do not judge my family!
we're not judging. You know that.
look, this has hit you hard, and that can make you change what you believe
stop it. Stop it. Stop acting like you understand, because you don't.
you don't. This is my child.
this is my child we are talking about, my child...
who I've done everything in my power to raise and protect.
and now she's gone and done something stupid-- stupid-- that'sonna ruin her life, and I'm not gonna let that happen.
I am her mother. I am her mother.
Naomi--- You have no right.
you have no moral high ground. You walked away from your child.
if you can live with that, i can live with this.
she's just upset. You
I know.
uh, I know this is a bad time, but my patient-- I- I could really use your help.
Yes.
please. Tell me she needs surgery. That I can do.
Oh, don't need your help opening a door.
you're not very good at taking help, are you?
Oh, actually, I am.
your idea about experimental protocols?
I contacted my friend at the F.D.A.got the info, went with it.
you're not taking out Colin's bolt?
you might be afraid to take a risk, but I'm not.
I assumed Naomi brought you in because you were just as cuttingedge as everyone else around here.
I didn't realize you were the safe alternative.
all right, you know what? You-- Hey.
you can't just say something like that and roll away.
can't hear you over the noise of my chair.
Hey, Pete.
Maya is pregnant. Sam needs to drink. You in?
uh, Lynn's in a lot of pain.
she shows no sign of fetal distress, but her labor isn't progressing.
I thought after my water broke...
well, I can give you oxytocin to speed up the labor and something for the pain.
my birth plan says no drugs.
Lynn has a birth plan.
Oh, many pages...And small font.
I want to experience my child's birth.
I did my homework, okay?
I understand that there are procedures that, you know, may become necessary, but except in a case of extreme emergency, you know, I want to be given the opportunity to accept or-- or refuse any procedure.
and as long as the baby's okay, all right, I want to have a natural childbirth.
so to get the labor going, I'm willing to try walking or castor oil or nipple stimulation
well, it's a little more involved.
if you fail to progress in your labor, you might want to consider a c-Section.
no. No.
Lynn, look, I know this can be disappointing
I've been in screaming pain for hours. I'm not--I'm not worried about being disappointed.
you know, I- I married a great guy.
you know, I wanted to have kids.
he wasn't ready...Ever.
and...
when the divorce was final, I decided to let loose.
you know, having a baby alone, being pregnant by some guy that I met at the tequila bar, is not every girl's dream, but this is what's happening, okay? And I am having this baby.
so is it too much to ask that one thing goes according to plan?
Naomi has lost her mind. I don't even know who she was today.
do you want Maya to have an abortion?
well, that's the point.
I'm a guy. It's-- it's-- it's not my choice.
well, right, but do you want her to
do I-- I want her to not be pregnant in the first place.
I want her to never have had sex.
I want her to live in a world where there are chastity belts and convents and little boys by the name of dink don't exist.
that-- that's what I want.
so don't ask me if I want...
my baby girl to have an abortion.
don't-- Don't ask me that.
because the answer is probably yes.
but it's not my choice.
you know, it's not Naomi's either.
look, just be glad you and charlotte don't have a kid.
once you have a child with someone, you are tied to them forever, even if they go nuts.
I'm--I'm sorry. I didn't...
I didn't mean that, man.
my daughter's pregnant.
Oh, I'm still here.
but then, so are you.
well, I left and I came back.
I thought about you and I was worried.
you don't have a friend coming, do you?
no. I'm not ready.
the thing is...I can't leave without my wife.
obviously, I- I can't leave with her.
so I can't leave.
can I sit with you for a while?
sure.
did you feel this way when you lost your child?
Well...Yeah, walking out that door was the hardest thing I ever did.
but...
Yeah, yeah, I did feel this way.
I have this tingling in-- in my stump, in my shoulder and my feet.
it's like they're asleep. I can't wake them up.
what is it? What's happening?
uh, a side effect of the antibiotics is neurotoxicity-- nerve damage.
is this what Dr. Wilder was afraid of?
no. I'm gonna lower the dosage on the antibiotic. That should lessen the effect.
we'll give it a shot.
Oh, god. Oh, god!
this is how today should've gone dn.
when we found out at our daughter was pregnant, we should've cried on each other's shoulders, we should've listened to what our daughter had to say, and then the two of us, together, should have discussed how to handle this.
that's not what happened.
talk to me.
deal with this.
I don't want to talk about it.
and I am dealing with it.
maybe not the way you want me to, but...
it's the only way I can.
I'll do it.
I'll have the abortion.
her.
that's grief. Definitely.
dead husband? Dead kid?
it's dead kid.
it's her face. She's got dead kid face...
like you.
I'm sorry. That didn't come out right.
no, it's okay. It's all right.
what do you mean about my face?
it's your eyes. You-- You've been someplace that most people have never been.
you've survived something that no one would have wanted to survive.
it's your eyes. It's...
they're, I don't know, empty.
well, I mean, that could be just doesn't have to be dead kid.
it could just be...
bad life.
no, it's dead kid or dead something.
what about me?
your face?
I mean, I know you don't know me, but do I look different?
you look like you're in shock, Nathan.
you look like something bad happened.
it's really nice of you to sit here, you know, but you don't-- you don't have to stay.
I'm sure that you have someplace to be.
no, actually. I don't.
sorry.
I thought you'd be at the gym. I just came to get the rest of my stuff.
Yeah, well, okay.
I bought the latex jumpsuit.
for me.
you bought it for me.
what, are you gonna have some other woman wear it?
well, so should i give it to you so you could wear it for some other guy?
Cooper, we can do this.
we liked each other once.
actually, we didn't.
we disliked each other, and then we had sex, and then we fell in love.
we never liked each other.
I guess you're right.
I think you should leave the practice.
what? - I'll take out a loan.
I'll sell my car.
I'll do whatever it takes to buy you out.
no.
no?
no. I'm building a business.
I don't care if you were there first. I belong there just as much as you do.
I'm not going anywhere.
useless, stupid love.
what? - Useless, stupid love!
wasted time. Just take your latex jumpsuit. Find another woman.
have a blast with it!
Oh, I can-- I will! I can't wait.
that's my towel you're wearing. I want it back.
Oh, god! Oh, god!
you're doing great, Lynn.
I feel great.
uh, we-- we could change the music.
we haven't listened to "chirping birds" yet.
I just wanted this to be beautiful, you know?
all my books said that the way a child comes into the world shapes them for life.
I just want to give him the best chance that he can have, you know?
I- I don't want to shape him to be some angry or-- or scared...
damn it.
I want him to have a good life.
okay, look...
no matter how today works out, even if you decide you can't take the pain, you're still gonna have plenty of opportunities to shape your child's life.
so can I give you something to help with the pain?
no.
just give me the chirping birds.
how many have you done?
more than I can count.
and they've all...
they've turned out...
well, "fine" isn't the word I'd use, but without complications.
my daughter's having an abortion tomorrow.
that in and of itself is a complication.
Sam, is it weird that it's me...doing it? - No.
would you prefer that I get a-- I'd understand if
no, you do it.
you do it the best you have ever done anything.
do it like your life depends on it.
it's Maya.
Colin, what happened?
something's wrong.
I- I told 'em to call you. I-- I know you wanted to take the bolt out.
you told me the antibiotics were too risky, but I w
this isn't even the right dosage.
Dr. Fife lowered it.
it was-- He said it was damaging my nerves and he said that his arm wouldn't work and
damn it. The infection is spreading. Get me a central line kit.
you have got to get that bolt out.
I'll take it under advisement.
You--It-- This is his life, and you are so concerned with your invention.
it's what Colin wanted.
it's what you sold him.
Naomi was right about you. You're full of crap.
you don't want to fix his arm. You want to fix your legs.
no. I already tried, and I can't.
okay, is that supposed to make me feel sorry for you?
I'm not doing this for me.
I've accepted what I lost and I'll accept it for Colin as well, but not yet.
you just don't want to see it.
maybe, and maybe there is something out there that we haven't thought of yet.
look, I'm not good at asking for help, but I'm asking.
my patient wants to pick up his life were it left off.
it may not be what you would choose, but it's what he chooses.
so do it for him.
you did not just see that.
isn't that what you were wearing yesterday?
Just...Helping out a friend.
want me to loan you something?
did you move all your stuff in here?
I sold my place.
I know.
it was a rookie mistake.
giving it all up for a guy, moving into Cooper's apartment, moving into the practice where he worked.
I changed my life to be with him.
I went all- in on forever.
does cooper know that?
no point now.
he wants me out.
he wants to pretend we didn't happen, that I don't exist.
well, he thinks that's gonna make him feel better.
but it won't.
it'll just make him feel...A- Alone.
I know the feeling.
me, too.
so...
do you want to wear slutty or professional?
Oh, Dell!
this is a big one!
still?
so we're here.
is everybody, uh, sure about this?
just...do it.
I couldn't stay stairs.
Charlotte? - She won't leave.
and then Sam and Naomi...
I feel like I should do something for them, like I should send food or something, but...
well, nobody's sick.
sending a tub of soup isn't gonna help.
I know. What am I supposed to do, Pete?
about charlotte?
accept it, move on. I mean, there's nothing you can do.
Sam and Naomi?
I don't know, man. I...
maybe that's why people send soup.
nothing you can do.
do you rember the day Maya lost her first tooth?
it fell out in the yard.
we spent about four hours looking for that thing because without proof, the tooth fairy wouldn't pay up.
and then there's today.
you know, we're gonna get through this.
once this whole thing is over and done, we're gonna get back there.
say something!
anything!
what do you want me to say?
you want me to say that I did the wrong thing?
okay. I did the wrong thing.
do I believe that I'm going to hell for forcing our daughter to have an abortion?
Absolutely.
do I regret doing what I had to do? No.
I would do anything, I would give my life to protect her, and if it means that I'm going to hell, then fine.
I'm going to hell.
Oh, Naomi--- I failed, Sam.
I failed...
first in our marriage, and now at being a mother.
no.
this is on both of us.
I thought I taught her right from wrong.
but she didn't listen.
it's like nothing I did made any difference.
I failed.
you're gonna experience some discomfort and some bleeding afterward for about a week.
the entire procedure won't take long.
I'm gonna use this instrument attached to suction to remove the pregnancy.
you'll have some cramping, just for a few seconds.
do you understand?
Maya, it's really-- it's important that you tell me whether or not you understand.
no. I don't understand.
ask me.
anything you want to know.
all my life, my mom told me that she would never...
never do this, that from the second they're conceived, a baby is a life
a gift from god-- And that abortion is wrong...
that it's murder.
Yes.
that's what your mother believes.
what about you?
what do you believe?
I believe that until a fetus can survive on its own outside the mother's body, that it is not a life.
I believe that life begins at birth.
so you think my mom was wrong before and that she's right now because she wants me to do this?
I think that your mother and I think differently.
that doesn't help me.
Maya, I can't help you with this decision.
I can and will give you an abortion or I can offer other options and see you through this pregnancy. But I can't help you decide.
I'm 15 years old.
which is why you shouldn't have been having sex in the first place.
and I say that as your aunt Addie, okay? But...
as your doctor, Maya, since you already have had sex and because you are pregnant...
Maya...I know this is hard.
I know that this is...
an unimaginably difficult, grown-up decision, and it's not fair that you have to make it. But you did a grown-up thing.
and now you are in a grown-up predicament.
so now it doesn't matter what I believe or what your mother believes.
what matters is what you believe.
it's up to you.
but my mom said I
until the 24th week of pregnancy, what a woman does with her own body is her business. It's law.
it's the law, Maya.
and of lot of fine women fought a long time to give you the right to do what you think is best.
your body, your choice.
Maya, you know what you want to do.
in your heart, in your gut, you know which way you want to go.
I've done this enough to know that.
you know what you want to do.
you just need to tell me.
I know you're tired, but on this next contraction, I'm really gonna need you to push.
I can't. - Yes, you can.
it hurts. - Come on, Lynn.
this is what you wanted, okay? You can do it.
I was wrong, okay? My birth plan is stupid. It's not working.
I've been awake for three days. I feel like i've been run over by a train.
okay, just turn off the hippie-ass flute sic and give me some drugs, now!
I-I can't give you drugs.
but I want drugs! Okay? You said I could change my mind!
I know it hurts, but we're almost there.
and that's why I can't give you any drugs.
please stop saying that.
okay, listen...you had a plan, and you've stuck to it, and not everyone can do that, but you did.
and I am here with you, and we are going to get through this.
I promise.
now push.
obviously the results weren't what we hoped.
I know it was just metal.
but...I swear, when I caught that tennis ball, I could feel it.
it was fuzzy, just a little bit of give.
we have to remove the bolt and a margin of tissue to make sure the infection is gone.
and we may need to remove the rest of your arm, possibly all the way up to your shoulder.
that's one option.
it would definitely save your life.
but...
but what?
there's been some success with biodegradable antibiotic implants.
it's risky. It requires surgery.
we'd have to implant the antibiotics directly next to the bolt site.
give you the life you want, let you dance at your wedding.
okay, you guys ready?
okay, slow down.
we never had kids.
my wife wanted kids.
I think we should leave.
look, you-- you have lost someone here who's very important to you.
and you're afraid that if you go home and walk into an empty room, that'll mean you're really alone.
I will be alone.
no. I'll...I'll go with you.
I didn't do it.
what?
I'm not having an abortion.
mom!
stop. What are you doing?
if you're coming in, you better be taking pictures.
is that what you want? - Addison, a little help.
I am not gonna let you ruin our life, little girl.
you think you know what you want? - All right, Lynn. Now come on. Push.
you have no idea. You have no idea what you want.
look at that. Look at that.
but look at that.
mom.
mom.
mommy!
I can't. I'm sorry. I- I can't.
this isn't the end of the world. You will get past this.
I need to get outta here.
don't do this. You don't want to turn your back on your child.
you just shut up! Just for once, just shut up!
for a minute, for now, shut up!
this is fun.
it's fine.
bet you'd be a great date.
if my wife hadn't just died, I'd ask you out.
that was funny.
let's try walking through the door.
we thought she had a cold.
a few years ago, we were supposed to go on a skiing trip, and we thought she had a cold.
but it never went away.
cancer.
and I- I knew it was coming. I knew it. So I slept there.
I slept in that hospital with her for months.
this house...
it was the last time we were happy together.
one step at a time.
I thought it would kill me.
stepping back into this house, I thought it would
I thought it would make her more gone.
But...She's here.
she loved it here.
and we were happy in this house.
thank you.
that dead kid face?
I'm turning turning into me it's not my son.
my son isn't dead.
it's me.
I walked away from my son.
I gave him away.
so...
I don't have a bag of his stuff or a last place where we were happy.
he never got to see me happy.
he's only 6 months old, and now I've let a total stranger believe he's dead.
I have a son...
and his name is Lucas.
is that what happened? You thought I was a nice guy, huh?
Dr. Bennett-- - Shut up. Shut the...
you shoulda been afraid of me.
you shoulda been terrified.
my face shoulda been in your head every single moment you were with Maya.
so look at me right now.
look long and hard and remember me saying, you will never hurt Maya again.
you got my daughter pregnant.
so help me god, if I could
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Maya's pregnant?
you didn't know.
Dr. Bennett...
I love her.
did you ever find your shoe?
no. Finish helping that friend?
Yeah, I did.
I want to punch him.
I didn't want a relationship, damn it.
I was fine being alone.
you know what I miss?
your martinis.
you sure do know how to change a subject.
no, I was just thinking that you have nowhere to go, and hotel rooms are...
cold and empty, and, um, I just-- I just don't know how to make a good martini.
you're inviting me to stay with you?
uh, well, you know, just until you get things sorted out.
you're not gonna get all talky about feelings or hair
I just want a martini.
evening.
what, you're not gonna make some warm-hearted comment about me being in a wheelchair?
I thought we were on a roll.
sorry.
you okay?
my 15-year-old daughter is pregnant.
and I tried to force her to have an abortion.
and I don't believe in abortion.
I've gone over the edge...And I don't know what to do.
this never happened.
damn right, it never happened.
I don't know if what happened today-- or what didn't happen today was...
the best thing or...
or a mistake.
I don't know.
how can you know?
I mean, you make a choice.
you do what you think is right at the time.
I mean, the plan is- meet a guy, fall in love, have a family.
but you have to be specific.
be older than 15, meet the right guy, stay in love.
stay in love.
I knew I forgot something.
why are we here today, dr. Turner?
I'm here for my son Lucas.
I want to share custody of him.
your son is almost a year old, yes?
in two weeks. In... In 2 weeks, he'll be 1.
so why now? After virtually no contact for almost a year, why are you now ready to be a mother to Lucas?
I'm here for the job interview.
Dr. Sicher is waiting for you.
right this way.
Dr. Turner is here.
Dr. Turner. Hi there.
I'm Dr. Ellen sicher.
come on in.
boy, your rum? Looks great.
you have no idea.
Oh, I have been looking and looking for someone who shares my philosophy to take over for me while I'm on maternity leave.
so can I ask what, uh, what brings you to new york?
e- excuse me?
can I ask why you're leaving l. A.?
and your current practice?
Oh, um, well, I was, um, on vacation in costa rica, and, um...
I'm sorry. I didn't...I didn't know you were...You're having a baby...Which is, um...
Yes. - Uh...
you're crying. - I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I will go.
no, no. Violet...
do you want to talk?
so what do you want me to say?
just do what the lawyer said.
be respectful and emphasize the fact that i've been the constant caregiver in Lucas' life.
so you want me to be nice?
be honest.
no, see, honest isn't nice.
I mean, this is a custody ttle. It's not nice.
you're just nervous.
no, I'm not, Pete. I mean, you're trying to keep Lucas out of Violet's hands, and I want to help, but, you know,
I work with violet. You know, I mean, she's a friend of mine...
sort of. So, you know, you gotta tell me what you want, Pete...
honest or nice?
be honest.
do you believe that Violet Turner is a fit mother?
please answer the queson.
no.
I do not believe Violet Lurner is a fit mother.
ms. Broome? - Mr. Parker, - you have an 8-year-old daughter? - Yes.
your wife died in a fire caused by her drug abuse.
a fire that your daughter almost died in, too, correct?
uh, I thought my wife was clean.
uh, I didn't... I didn't know.
Mr. Parker, I'm sorry, but isn't it true that you didn't allow your daughter to say good-bye to her dying mother?
Mr. Parker? - Y- uh...
Heather's...
my wife's face was badly burned, and I didn't want...
I wanted to spare my daughter seeing her that way.
is that the reason?
or did you feel your wife was unstable and undeserving of seeing your daughter?
no further questions, your honor.
she looks upset. I'm gonna go in now.
no, leave her alone.
she got beat up in court today
Hey, can I get you some food?
or a martini?
you don't give someone liquor who's clearly upset about.
liquor is exactly what you offer someone.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'll be fine. I just need to, um...
Hey, uh, this is the third message I'm leaving.
please come back.
I need, uh, I need someone who's on my side.
I'm on her side.
you sure about that?
so when Violet found out she was pregnant, you moved in with her?
Yes, I wanted to lend her my support.
you're a very good friend, Dr. Freedman.
it's easy to be a good friend to Violet. She's a good frien me.
Dr. Freedman, did you meet your girlfriend on an internet sex site?
I met my ex-girlfriend on a site where adults go to meet other adults.
do I... Do we...Is this...
ms. Broome, unless you can get there real fast...
different area, then.
you have a reputation as a pediatrician who'd go to any length to protect his patients, do you not?
I believe in keeping my patients safe.
in fact, didn't you recently spend some time in jail protecting a child you believed was being abused?
Yes. I'm proud of that.
are you really prepared to turn a baby over to a woman with obvious mental health issues?
objection. Argumentative. - Sustained.
if Lucas were your patient and not the child of your closest friend, would you think that shared custody would be in his best interest?
given everything she's been through, you really think Violet Turner is a fit mother?
I'm just saying that maybe the two of you should talk, Pete.
you know, there's a way to be decent about this.
do you have any e-mails from Violet where she mentions Lucas?
we work in the office next door to each other. We don't e-mail.
I'm just asking. - Well, I'm just telling you.
what do you want me to do, lose this thing?
do you want me to...
to hand over my kid to her for half of every week?
shared custody is not the worst thing... - No.
Pete... - No!
okay, shh, shh.
okay, shh.
it's okay. Here.
okay, here. It's okay.
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.
I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.
where is she?
she said she'll be here.
she'll be here.
your honor, our next witness is traveling from quite a distance just moments away.
I'm afraid if your witness is not here, then I call Dr. Naomi bennett as our next witness.
it's easy for everyone else just to talk about how Violet should just get on with her life and just move on, but when life throws you a curveball, it's not easy.
so you can empathize with violet's, uh, - inability to move on? - I do.
because of your relationship with your own daughter?
you are estranged, correct?
much the same way that Violet is estranged from her son.
we were for a brief time, but things are better now.
so you support your 15 year old's pregnancy and marriage?
no.
are you talking with her?
we just n-need a little space.
do you believe that your need for space from your own child allows you to accept Violet's behavior toward her child?
no, no, no, that is not it.
no, I was...
I was with Pete.
I was there when he found her, just minutes after the tack.
I mean, and her baby in a pool ojust gone. Blood.
there are no words to adequately convey the horror of what she went through and what I witnessed.
the image of her like that it still haunts my dreams, and, uh, and so does the guilt of being powerless to help her or help her find lucas.
if that still terrorizes me, I- I can't even imagine how it's affected Violet.
and, uh, I have compassion for her, for my friend.
so what happened when you opened the door and Katie was on the other side of it?
I already told you. I was attacked.
Yeah, but what happened?
what did Katie do? How did you react?
what were you feeling during the attack?
I can't talk about the attack anymore.
you've discussed it? With whom?
I have worked through the attack, and now I want to focus on getting back to my life.
we have talked about this. - I mean, i've told you that.
I...No. Just...
no. - Violet, you cannot shrink yourself.
I know that you want to have control over this situation, most likely because you didn't have control over the attack. I get it.
but it's not gonna help you get through this.
now you've been seeing me for some time now.
and I assume that you came to me because you want my help.
so let me help you.
okay?
okay. - So...
what happened when you opened the door?
Katie jabbed a needle into my arm.
and then?
sometimes p. T.S. D. causes flashbacks or intense fear, hypervigilance, numbness or avoidance.
have you treed violet turner for p. T.S. D? Counseled her?
well, I'm her friend, her ex-boyfriend, and it's a funny story, actually. I...I was almost lucas' father.
excuse me. How exactly is that possible?
well, Violet and I were dating when she srted sleeping with Pete.
uh, which is to say, uh, not that she's promiscuous. She's not.
it's just that she, um...
well, it was a confusing time for all of us, I think. And, um...My point was that none of us knew who the father was until a few weeks after lucas was born, so I naturally became very attached to him.
Dr. Turner didn't know dr. Wilder was the father when she turned the child over to him?
not definitively, no.
back to the question. Have you ever treated Violet Turner?
no. Given our history, being her therapist would be a breach of ethics.
so given her behavior, her inability to connect with her son after the attack, do you believe that violet turner suffers from p. T.S. D?
objection. Dr. Wallace is not called as an expert witness nor as Dr. Turner's psychiatrist.
you don't have to answer that.
I suspect violet suffers from p. T.S. D.
Hey.
thank you so much for coming.
Oh, god. I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
Oh, I'm just so sorry.
I'm so sorry that you have to go through all this.
and, uh, I hope this isn't my fault.
when you were gone and you couldn't be there for Lucas...
I...I encouraged Addison to be there.
thank you.
thank you.
we're gonna fight this.
we're gonna fight, and you're gonna get your son back.
okay. - Absolutely.
Alright?' - All right.
we call Dr. Amelia Shepherd to the stand.
P. T.S. D.Causes identifiable neural correlates.
uh, and we can see them clearly in an m. E.G. Scan.
here we see that violet has high abnormal activity in the temporal lobes as well as atrophy in the hippocampus. Both are consistent with p. T.S. D.
can you interpret these findings?
there is evidence that p. T.S. D.Is a physical disease.
which means? - It's treatable.
talk therapy, antianxiety drugs? - Both are traditional routes.
personally, I would treat it with beta-blockers.
P. T.S. D.Manifests with a host of physical symptoms, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath.
take away the physical response from the memories, and you've taken away the condition.
so what you're saying is, dr. Turner could be treated as easily as prescribing a heart medication?
that's what I'm saying.
this is a physical ailment.
war vets, victims of abuse, people who have been accidents...They all get it.
we're not trying to take their kids away from them.
give the woman back her child.
Pete... - Okay, you are not welcome here anymore.
whoa. First, screw you, and second, this is not your house.
this is Addison's house. - Amelia...
come on. - Look, look, we have to go pick up Lucas anyway.
let's just stay at your house tonight. - No. Pack and leave.
Pete, let's just...
I was called to testify, I got on the stand, I told the truth.
you've been out of medical school for five minutes.
you come to my custody hearing. - Who do you think a custody hearing for my son... - What?
I am a board certified neurosurgeon. - And you start spouting some psuedo-sentific crap.
you know what? I'll be at my house if you need me.
Addie, what are you doing?
I mean, you are letting him... - It's his child.
yeah? Well, the way he's acting, maybe he's the one with p. T.S. D.
when you say "abandonment..." - That's what it was.
violet abandoned our child.
that's a strong word, "abandonment."
another strong word is "hate."
have you ever hated anyone, dr. Wilder? - Not that I know of.
you were married, correct? - Yes.
what happened to your wife?
she died. - How did you feel about her death?
did you ever say that you hated your wife and you felt nothing about her death?
Yes.
I don't care who she's been to you in the past.
today Violet is your enemy, and we're fighting for Lucas' life.
now do you want to win this or not?
violet Turner's a great mother.
it doesn't give you pause that violet gave her baby away to Pete?
violet knew her limits and asked for help.
she did more for her child thant mothers do.
she coulda kept her child, hired a nanny, spent her days locked in her room with the vapors like my mother, but she didn't.
do you think... - I'm not finished.
she handed Lucas over to his father out of love for her child.
now she's spending all her time apologizing for taking care of herself.
as far as I'm concerned, she doesn't have to apologize to anyone for anything.
she's getting on with her life the best way she can.
she's ready to spend time with her son.
I don't see why we aren't all supporting her.
so Violet talks to you about wanting to be with Lucas, shows you photos of him, talks about milestones?
milestones? God, no.
violet and I are friends 'cause she isn't that kind of mother.
I hate babies. So does she.
I mean we don't like other people's babies.
but she likes Lucas.
she does. She loves him.
violet hates babies.
that's a nice one.
Really?
after what you said, you're coming to discuss my testimony?
she was counting on us. - At least I tried to be loyal.
I know I messed it up, but you didn't even try.
so don't you come and try to push your guilt on to me.
I'm not taking any of it.
why don't you stuff it where the sun don't shine?
do you think Addison Ntgomery is a good influence in Lucas' life?
I need a verbal answer, dr. Bennett. - I- I don't know.
have you seen her with Lucas? - Yes.
have you seen her feeding him and bathing him, playing with him?
Yes.
does she seem comfortable? - Enough.
Dr. Bennett, can you think of any reasons why Addison Montgomery might not be a good influence on Lucas...
or reasons why Violet Turner would be?
Dr. Bennett, she asks, you respond.
right.
you know what, your honor? We're done here.
Sam. Sam, what was that?
they asked me questions, and I answered.
that was it? That was all you had to give?
you know this was important to me. - I couldn't.
you should've gotten up there... - I- I wanted to...
well, why not? - And I-I couldn't.
B- because of me?
because you... - I'm in love with Addison, I love her, and at the same time, I hate her.
seeing her with Pete is killing me.
last night, I was out on my deck, and I could hear all three of them next door.
and Lucas was laughing, and if I had gotten up on the stand and said what I wanted to say, I want to tear them apart.
I want to take that baby away from them.
but it's for the wrong reasons.
so I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
but I-I need to be able to look myself in the mirror and know that I'm a good man.
I'm trying to be a good man.
so I said nothing, because if I had said what I wanted to say, I wouldn't have been testifying for you.
I would've been testifying for me.
Dr. Turner, if you win, if partial custody is granted to you, what do you look forward to with Lucas?
what are you looking forward to?
I...I can't wait to watch him sleep again.
after he was born, uh, before I gave him to Pete, I used to watch him sleep, and he just...He looked so peaceful.
and, uh...Well, now he's trying to walk and form words and, um...And I want to be a part of all that.
I don't wanna...I don't wanna miss anything else.
do you want to take a minute, get some water?
no, I'm okay.
so you're glad you had Lucas.
cause you did think about aborting him, didn't you?
just like you aborted a number of other babies, right?
me. That's me. Here.
me.
what if I lose?
we're not gonna lose.
we. What if I lose?
we. We. what if we lose?
what if we lose? - It's not losing anyway, all right?
not Like she's gonna hurt him.
it's not like I said she was gonna drown him in the bathtub.
you know what? It's past his bedtime.
he should've been asleep, like, a half-hour ago.
I'm gonna put him down, okay? - It's just...
we don't need her, this. We don't need this.
can you, uh, get the door, please?
Yeah.
ready? Say good night.
good night. - Say night-night.
Night-night, daddy.
I went to your house first, but you weren't there.
so I figured, I mean, Addison's, it...
I mean, I know it's late and my lawyer would be upset if she knew that I was here, but...
what?
how did we get here, Pete?
I mean, here, in court.
you sued me. - I know that, but isn't...Isn't there a more civil way of doing this?
your lawyer knows all these personal things about everyone.
so does yours. - Well, that's why i'm asking, how did we get here?
violet, you put Lucas in my arms and made me solely responsible for his well-being.
I have to do what I think is right for him.
Really?
because it feels like...The way...The way you look at me, it feels like punishment, like you are punishing me.
that's not my intention.
well, Sam say a thing.
he said that he loves Addison, but that he hates Addison.
so it makes it hard for him to...
look, clearly, you hate me.
but are... Are you doing all this because...
are you still in love with me?
violet. - Leave me alone.
Hey, hey, come on. Come here.
Hey, what the hell was that?
what? - Fellas, keep it together.
that's good advice. - No, screw that.
do you have any idea what you just did?
you don't understand. - That's crap, Cooper.
I have a daur, okay? That's crap.
where is she? - Inside.
Hey, maybe we should give her a minute?
you okay?
you want me to fire Cooper?
cause I can.
I'll fire Charlotte. I been looking for a reason to fire Charlotte.
say the word, and I will.
who knew?
who knew that everyone thought I wasuch a horrible person?
what'll happen if I lose?
I can't go through this again.
what would you tell a patient if she were going through this?
I don't know. Come on.
Yeah, you do. Yeah, you do.
I'm still in love with Pete.
don't tell anyone. Okay?
okay.
okay, let's go back. Let's go back.
at what point during the attack did your mind drift to Lucas?
why is this significant?
because we've recounted this numerous times, and at no point have you mentioned your baby, not once, and I want to talk about him.
okay, so let's go back. You're on the floor...
well, blood was pouring out of my body and I was ruining the rug. I don't know.
stick with me, Violet.
just stay with me.
do you know how much I begged her not to do it?
do what?
to cut him out of me.
Nal, do you mind if I sit?
what am I gonna say, no?
how did we get here?
how did we let it get this bad?
I don't know.
you like playing house with my son, Addison?
there are two people who knew about my abortions, and I am sure Naomi was not the one who told.
I... - You want to fight dirty?
let's fight dirty. But you started it.
remember that when you're on the stand.
do you believe that violet turner is a fit mother?
please answer the question.
no, I do not believe that violet turner is a fit mother.
she's made no contact with the baby.
I've tried to fill that void.
I know I'm not his mother.
I didn't, uh...It was not my intention to, but it just sort of happened, and, um...
I- I'm glad that it did. He's a very special little boy.
well, I commend you, dr. Montgomery.
not many women would take on the responsibility of raising another woman's child.
no further questions.
would you call yourself an honest person, dr. Montgomery?
Yes, I would. - You were married, right?
Yes, I was. I'm...I'm divorced now.
and why did your marriage dissolve? - Objection.
why is Dr. Montgomery's marriage relevant?
well? - It goes to her credibility, your honor.
answer, Dr. Montgomery.
I, uh...Had an affair, and my husband left me.
and who did you have an affair with?
he was my husband's best friend.
didn't you also have an affair with your patient's husband, uh, Dr. Noah barnes, I believe.
we never slept together.
broken your vows when it served you, haven't you?
which begs the question, how much trust can we put in your credibility here today?
objection. Seriously, this is abusive.
all right, moving on.
why don't you have children, dr. Montgomery?
I can't.
did you ever want to have children?
Yes, I tried, but I was not able to.
so would you lie on the stand to keep Lucas, to protect your one last chance at motherhood?
object - No, I want to answer.
you're right.
I'm a cheater and a husband stealer, and on top of all that, I'm barren so good times.
I...I never wanted any of this to happen.
I never wanted to hurt violet.
Yes, she's a mess. I'm a mess, too. I...I'm here for lucas.
he's a baby, so he can't speak for himself.
but I'm pretty sur, he'd say that he wanted to feel loved and safe and have cereal for dinner.
I just want Lucas to be happy. So if that means you tearing me apart and making me look like the most horrible person on earth, then please, go ahead and do it, because Lucas is worth it to me. So...
next question...
ms. Gibson?
are you still in love with me?
I'm sorry...Everything that's happening has hurt you.
but I can't let you hurt lucas the way you hurt me.
I have to protect him.
you... You didn't answer the question.
what do you expectm me?
I don't know. I, I mean, we made a baby together.
I mean, the least we could offer each other is honesty.
honest? Fine.
I'm done. I have moved on.
I'm over you.
I wish you well. Best of luck in all your future endeavors.
you've ripped my heart out and you walked away from our child.
I have moved on. I don't love you.
you want me to be honest?
honesty isn't nice.
you were fantastic on the stand today.
if that doesn't win it for us, I don't know...
is the baby asleep? - What?
is Lucas asleep? - Yeah, he went down fine.
how did your lawyers know about violet's abortions?
answer me.
I had to do something to help us win.
I don't even know what to say to you.
Wh... - Pete, I don't know.
Addison, why don't you start... - I don't know.
it's like you...You have done some horrible things during this trial, but I told myself it's because, you know, you're worried and you're scared.
but now...Now it's like you've shut down Pete and become this cold, hard, mean...
you know what? Mind your own business.
mind my own business? - Yeah, stay outta this.
this is my business. You made it my business when you put your son in my arms.
if I didn't love that kid, I'd sit back and I'd watch you and violet tear each other to shreds.
but I do love him, and that is who I am concerned about here.
and I'm not?
you better think about what you're gonna say to him when he asks you one day,"why did you do this to my mother?"
and what are you gonna say?
I hope you're gonna have something good to say, Pete, - or else otherwise, he's gonna... - What, what, he's gonna hate me?
no, he is gonna be ashamed of you, like I am right now.
why are we here?
I mean, all we ever wanted since Lucas was born was for Violet to be a part of his life.
how many times did she walk out of a room that he was in?
how many times did she walk around him or by him or pretend that Lucas didn't exist?
and every time, you and I, we'd run into a corner and have a hushed conversation, hoping and praying that she would just look at him.
exactly. That's... - Okay, but she did.
she looked at him.
you know, Violet did what we all asked of her, and instead of supporting her or breathing a sigh of relief, because, yeah, it's about time...
we're in court, you know, telling her,"no, violet, you can't be a mother to your son."
it's a little hypocritical, don't you think?
Cooper, she's not ready.
deep down, I think you know that.
do you believe that Violet Turner is a fit mother?
Dr. Freedman?
answer the question, dr. Freedman no, I...
violet, I should've...I should've told you how I was feeling.
I didn't because I wanted to be there for you.
I was going to be there for you, and I got up there and I realized that this is about Lucas.
but I shoulda talked to you first. I'm sorry.
all right, I'm gonna give you five minutes.
you've got five minutes to sulk about what everybody said about you in there.
you got five minutes to cry and scream and to call them every single bad name in the book.
then when those five minutes are up, you're gonna walk back into that courtroom and you're gonna fight for your son.
I can't. I can't. - I'm sorry, but the clock's ticking.
damn it, Naomi.
you know, maybe he's better off without me, okay?
maybe I am a terrible mother.
well, that does not mean that you quit.
Yes, there will be times when you let your child down.
there will be times when you do the wrong thing.
there will be times when you are a horrible mother.
but that does not mean that you quit.
it means that you fight harder.
I mean, that's... That's what I should done.
so go back in there and fight.
fight for the both of us.
stick with me, Violet.
do you know how much I begged her not to do it?
do what?
to cut him out of me.
I begged and I begged and I begged.
and when...When I knew she was gonna do it, I- I told my baby, I told lucas that mommy was very sorry for letting this happen.
and, um...And then I...And then I let her. - Let her what?
I told katie how to cut him out of me, where to cut, how deep the incision should be, how to see through the blood.
I helped her.
I helped her take my baby away from me.
listen to me.
what could've happened to Lucas had Katie made the incision incorrectly?
she... She could've cut him.
and what could've happened to Lucas if she cut too deep?
she could've cut him. - That's right.
and what could've happened to Lucas had you not helped katie see through the blood?
she could've cut him. - Yes.
you helped Katie to cut Lucas out because you were trying to protect him.
you brought Lucas into this world safe and unharmed.
you did that., even as you almost bled to death.
do you understand what that means?
I chose Lucas... - Yes.
over me. I chose Lucas.
Yes. And you chose him again when you gave him to Pete.
do you hear me?
you saved your little boy.
I saved him? - Yes.
please answer the question, dr. Turner.
how many abortions have you had?
two.
and you considered aborting Luc.
I- I hadn't planned on becoming a mother, so, yes, I considered it, but then I changed.
so did you have any doubts about being a mother before the attack?
every woman has dots about becoming a mother. - Answer the question.
Yes, I had normal amount of uncertainty about becoming a mother.
why didn't you do a paternity test?
until I understood what motherhood meant to me, I couldn't consider the feelings of a partner, so not knowing seemed to be the best option.
and aftehe was born? - Let's get this straight.
Lucas was noborn.
he was ripped from my body.
and afterwards, I was fighting for my life and my sanity, so I couldn't quite focus on who the father was.
we all understand the amount of stress that you were under, but in that situation, in any situation, don't you think putting your own needs first is the antithesis of being a good mother?
I've spent a lot of time thinking like that, Ms. Broome, a lot of time thinking that I was poison for my child.
but now I know that it's not true.
Voii have gone to therapy.
I kn I have done the work.
and I know with every fiber of my being that I am ready to be Lucas' mother.
and when I wasn't ready, I gave him to the one person I knew that would put Lucas' life before his own.
and that was Pete.
and my friends stepped in and helped.
and they are protective of Lucas. And as hard as it is to hear their concern for me, I'm glad that they're protective.
but I'm back.
and I am not gonna apologize or be made to feel bad for doing what was best for my child and for me.
I am here today, because I'm healed.
and I want to share custody of my son.
I am ready to share in the burden of parenting, and I deserve the chance, because I did the work, because I got better and because I am Lucas' mother.
I am Lucas' mother.
and no one else can say that.
last question, Dr. Wilder.
given everything that's been said, given your personal experience, would you say that Violet Turner is a fit mother?
Dr. Wilder?
I'd like to say something.
of course.
he's just like you, you know that?
he's stubborn already... And sensitive.
he observes people, laughs all the time, for no reason whatsoever. He's just like you.
and I want him to know you, Violet. I do.
it's just, he doesn't know pain yet.
and I know it's coming one day. It's inevitable...He'll get his heart broken.
but I want to hold that off as long as I possibly can.
and I think that if you're ready to be part of Lucas' life...
I know what you're like when you love someone.
I know what that feels like.
and it's the best feeling in the world.
and I want Lucas to know that love, because you're his mother.
and I think that if you can love him...
and I think you will be able to soon...
I think we have a chance to raise the happiest, most loved little boy in the world.
but please, Violet...Be ready.
that's all I ask.
Dr. Turner, you suffered a great tragedy, and I sympathize with everything you've beethrough.
I commend you for going to therapy and getting yourself ready to have a relationship with your child.
it's a testament to your strength.
over the couof this trial, many people who know you best and care for you most expressed that they don't believe you're ready to be a mother right now.
and as much as I appreciate how far you've come and the intensity of your desire to be with lucas, I cannot simply substitute my judgment for theirs.
therefore, I grant full custody to Dr. Wilder, with supervised visitation to Dr. Turner.
Dr. Turner is free to file a petition to revisit this arrangement in the future.
Hey. - Hey.
how's William?
he's really sick.
I'm sorry.
all right. Well, I should get going. It's good to see you.
Maya's eight months pregnant, and I've never even felt the baby kick.
I haven't helped with the nursery.
I haven't bought one stitch of baby clothing.
nothing.
well, she needs more baby clothes.
all I got was this... Tiny little baseball cap.
thing is in the nursery except a bassinette.
so you could go crazy in there.
and the baby kicks on cue when there's music playing, so if you wanted to spend time singing to Maya's belly.
you could do that.
it's too late
you're her mother.
it's never too late.
this is something, isn't it?
Yeah.
it's something.
that was you...Pete's testimony.
it's okay. It's okay. You don't have to...
it's just...
well, we've...We've been through a war this week, and, uh, and I lost.
so I'm trying to appreciate the small things.
so if you helped Pete, and if he hates me a little bit less because of you, then...Then that's something I can appreciate.
I'm sorry.
God, I didn't expect... I- I thought the judge...
no, don't. It's not the end of the world.
it's a step.
it's a small step, but it's a step.
I'm going to see Lucas, and I'm going to be happy.
are you?
I don't know.
Pete doesn't hate you.
Violet's not here.
look...I don't know where I'm headed. - Do I look like a gps to you?
could you just shut up and let me finish, let me talk?
figuratively speaking, I don't know where I'm headed.
I do know I haven't been myself lately, and even though i'm trying to get back there, I don't know how long that's gonna take.
where was I going with that? I, I had this memorized.
you were saying you don't know squat.
right. Okay...
what I do know...What I realized from this whole ordeal, is what's important, like, um...The people that you love.
and you are important to me, Charlotte.
you're important to me, too.
have dinner with me?
he talks to me about feelings, he's amazing in bed, he cooks for me-food.
Yeah, he's perfect.
I'm perfect with him. Addisam.
she's freaking out. Ignore her. - Addisam.
I can't just ignore... - Say something shrinky then.
uh, being a-a happy couple is a healthy thing.
what's wrong with him?
he has no flaws. - Well, he knows you.
you know him. There is love. You have a good foundation.
is that a metaphor, like, uh, floorboards and a basement?
no, like he knows how to commit, like pete knows how to commit. It's a good thing.
Really? Because in my
shut up, bitches.
I need to get laid.
I need to get laid really bad.
so bad, I am gonna run naked through the streets and grind a cop if something doesn't happen soon.
would one of you just lie on top of me and rub around for, like, ten minutes?
I thought you and Mark Sloan... - That was weeks ago, which in sex years is like a decade ago.
where are all the men in this city?
Sheldon is single.
do you hate me or something?
Sheldon is smart, thoughtful, charming... And great in bed.
Really? - Really?
Oh, morning, ladies.
what?
nothing, nothing, I was just coming to find you.
ready to go?
security at the prison can-can... be a-a bit of a pain.
all right, look, I know it's not sex, but come watch me deliver a baby.
miracle of life, always reaffirming, always puts me in a good mood.
Really?
it's always the quiet ones.
what do you think about starting a family?
now? - Not now, but... Soon.
we're engaged. These are the kinds of things that engaged people discuss.
how can you be thinking about babies when we're doing this?
you do know that this is how babies get made, right?
not the way I do it.
Oh, okay.
I'm serious.
we... We do want to have kids of our own, right?
can we talk about this later?
babies are a wonderful gift.
they're god's little creatures... We should totally discuss this later.
okay, so I'm seeing five inmates, you're seeing two.
and remember, you're just there to assess the inmates, give your recommendation to the parole board. Okay?
you're not there to make nice.
so no flirting with the inmates?
you're making light, but these are hard-core criminals, violet.
they're persuasive, and charming, and good at getting you to think that they're not criminals, okay?
so just stay on your side of the table, be professional.
right, don't accept anything from a prisoner...
don't offer to do anything for a prisoner.
Oors relax. I read the file. I got it.
I'm fine.
I'm a big girl.
love you, Tracy. You're doing a great job.
I love you, too.
how are we doing, Dr. Montgomery?
looking good.
baby's starting to crown.
I can see her head.
Oh, you hear that, honey?
you can see Kyla's head. She's gonna be beautiful, just like you.
honey, could you-could you not put the camera...
please don't film my...
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
okay, you guys are the nicest people I have ever seen in a delivery.
all right, we're almost there, Tracy. Just one more push. Ready?
push.
good. Almost there. - Here comes Kyla.
I'll get oxygen and an intubation tray.
I'll set up the ultrasound.
she's not crying. Why-why isn't she crying?
is-is something wrong?
she's just having some trouble breathing.
I just wanted to get her over here... And take a look.
tell me it's not as bad as I think.
how can someone this small have a tumor this big?
okay, Mr. Cartwright, you have completed 40 years of a 50-year sentence for murder and armed robbery.
well, I guess we both know what's in here, right?
why don't we just talk instead?
tell me about your rehabilitation.
what do you want to know?
do you feel changed for the better?
I'm definitely a different man.
and I think about what I did to you, feel sorry for every day.
so you feel ready for the outside, ready to rejoin society?
can I say something, ma'am?
Dr. Turner. Violet Turner.
Dr. Turner, I've been up for parole twice, and each time, a therapist just like you asked me the same list of questions, and I end up saying what I need to say to get the result I need to get.
but you seem like a nice lady.
I'm not gonna waste your time. I'm gonna be honest with you.
I'm a model prisoner.
I've never had a major write-up.
I've worked in the mail room 30 years.
I've co-led classes in anger management and taught young prisoners how to read.
I'm proud of that.
but I know none of that's gonna mean anything once I get outside these walls.
I've lived more of my life locked up than free.
I'm old.
and if released... I'll get swallowed up out there, and I know that.
but here in prison, I feel at home.
it's where my friends are, my life is.
so I'm asking you... To lie to the parole board, tell 'em that I'm dangerous, unremorseful, and get me denied.
do whatever you have to do, but please... Help me stay in prison.
it's remarkable... And so intricate.
in just ten weeks, it has partially compressed the lung and attached to the major vessels.
don't sound so gleeful.
well, I'm sorry.
it's just... It's a beautiful tumor.
Sam? - It's a pleuropulmonary blastoma.
it's putting pressure on the heart.
what are you guys gonna do?
it's a 12-hour surgery, and I need some help separating it from the cardiac vessels.
are you in? - Yeah, sure.
we should probably get Charlotte on the horn, start gathering the best team, an oncologist.
Daniel and Tracy were so excited. They're the perfect couple.
I just... Hate to shatter their world.
well, that's the thing about perfect.
it doesn't exist.
how was convict day? - Convict day?
talking to prisoners about their parole, you know, with sheldon.
the state gives us a bundle.
do you even listen to me when I talk to you in the morning?
I do.
I listen closely.
you never said anything about working with convicts.
Oh, well, I don't know. Maybe I forgot.
anyway, the point is that my prisoner wants me to lie to the parole board and have him denied.
he wants to stay in prison.
Why?
he's old. It's home.
good. Done. Case closed.
no, not-not done, not closed.
how can I just leave a man in prison, just let him stay in the system when he clearly doesn't belong there?
doesn't this strike you as so, so sad?
not really.
why is everyone here so callous?
everyone's not so... - We gave Betsey away.
dell's child, our dead friend's child - We put her in the system, too.
this isn't about Betsey.
I know.
so-so what is your problem?
your my wife, the mother of my child, you were brutally attacked by someone who is now in the system.
so forgive me if I feel a little... Callous.
forgive me for caring.
you should feel like crap.
Oh, shut up.
what do you think about me and Charlotte having kids?
is charlotte pregnant? - no.
uh, but you know, she will be one day, and we'd have cute kids, right?
so now you want a child?
this really isn't about Betsey.
okay, fine.
well, uh, does Charlotte feel like she's ready to be a mother?
we're, um... Still talking.
good. That's good.
Charlotte with kids.
I never thought, um... Well, it's good... That you're talking.
isn't she too young for surgery?
the surgery is risky.
every surgery is.
but we've got the best surgical team assembd, and I'm confident about their abilities.
uh, Dr. Rodriguez, meet Dr. Addison Montgomery...
how do you do? - And Daniel and Tracy Woods.
Dr. Rodriguez is the oncologist.
he'll be the a part of the team working to treat Kyla.
I know this is a rough time for you, but we're going to do everything in our power to save your baby.
you're actually right on time.
we were just discussing the surgery.
surgery?
have you discussed chemo as an alternative to surgery?
Yes, but I believe surgery will be more effective.
only if she survives.
wait. Chemo's better than surgery?
in my opinion, yes.
based on the C.T. Kyla has a type II P.P.B. Tumor.
chemo is the treatment of choice.
it's less invasive and risky.
I disagree. I've seen the c. t.too, and I believe that kyla has a classic type I tumor.
surgically removing the tumor will cure her.
I can tell you about the advantages of chemo.
excuse me... - Maybe we should step outside, doctors.
if you two want to gunsling, do it out here, not in front of the family.
chemo is the standard, proven method of treatment.
of course you'd say that. You're a cancer doc. Chemo is all you do.
of course you go against it.
you're a surgeon. Cutting is all you do.
I think the goal here is to figure out what makes sense, not argue.
in no way is it necessary to do the surgery now, when there's another viable, safer option.
okay, it's safer to put a baby through months and months of chemo and watch it suffer? That's safer?
if we can reduce the mass and shrink the cancer cells, it will make doing the surgery later easier.
Yeah, but there's no guarantee that the chemo is gonna remove the tumor.
and you can guarantee that with surgery?
Yes, I can, or I wouldn't be standing here.
Montgomery, we don't make guarantees.
one surgery cures this baby... And she never has to see a hospital again.
and you get to be the hero.
Yes, Dr. Rodriguez, that's usually how it goes.
you're the chief. It's your call.
the parents have obviously put their trust in Dr. Montgomery's judgment, and so have i.
we're doing the surgery.
help!
we need help in here. Something's wrong with Tracy.
she's hemorrhaging.
I need two large-bore I.V.S and an l.R. wide open.
I'll get them. - Pulse is racing. She's hypotensive.
type and cross two units, and I need an O.R. Now.
it was a postpartum hemorrhage.
it happens. I was able to control the bleeding.
she'll wake up soon. We just have to give her time.
you know, you date, you get married.
you never even think that something bad might happen.
we've never had any kind of problems, and now...
now my entire family's in danger, and they're depending on me.
what am I supposed to do?
you sit down and you wait for your wife to wake up, because she will, and then you let me take care of Kyla.
what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
violet, y...you can't... - I know.
it's just... Lewis has been locked up for four decades.
he doesn't have any family. He doesn't have any support system. He's got no one.
this isn't about Betsey.
I know.
why does everyone keep... I know.
do you?
H - how is he gonna make a new life for himself after being locked up for so long?
I mean, he went to prison in 1970.
Nixon was president.
there were no computers or cell phones or freakin' microwaves.
prisoners reenter society every day.
they don't all fail.
you know, he could make it.
but how are people gonna treat him?
you tell someone that you've done time in prison, and I don't care how liberal they are, they're walking the other way.
well, this is a man, a man who made a mistake, but he owes it to himself to get out there and make a life.
he deserves a chance to do that, even if he doesn't want to.
I have to get back to the prison.
I gotta talk to the parole board.
violet, I'm gonna say the same thing to you I said about Betsey.
don't lose all your objectivity.
don't get attached. Just...
do what you know is right.
is she awake yet?
not yet, but Daniel still wants to go ahead with Kyla's surgery, so we're gonna do it.
Oh, Daniel, I was just coming to talk to you.
uh, this is Dr. Sam Bennett.
he's gonna be assisting me with the surgery.
well, actually, that won't be necessary anymore.
see, I-I spoke with that oncologist again, and I'm going with the chemo.
Daniel, you have every right to change your mind, but I-I really think that this is a decision that you and Tracy need to make together.
my wife is unconscious, and my baby has a tumor, so I'm not into taking any risks right now.
so, no. I've made the decision for us both.
I think that Tracy......
Dr. Montgomery, I really won't be needing your opinion anymore.
Dr. King knows about this.
she's given me her full support, so you can just stay out of it for now.
thank you.
great.
no messages.
any of your patients need brain surgery?
Nope.
you used to date Sheldon.
date is a strong word.
I used to screw Sheldon.
and would you... recommend him?
and he knows what to do with it.
morning.
afternoon.
there's plenty of coffee in the kitchen.
you don't have to go downstairs.
we should work together.
I've heard about your skills. I bet you could teach me something.
you're talking about therapy?
and other things.
did you see that? - What?
she was checking me out like a piece of meat.
Amelia's young and hot.
and, uh, that's a lot of woman.
Yeah, well, I can get women, Cooper.
I- I-didn't- I've-I've had women, lots of women.
I'm just saying, I can handle it.
okay. Excuse me.
where the hell is the coffee?
just talk to Charlotte. Maybe she can explain what happened.
what's with all the noise?
so from complete faith in me to totally shutting me out?
what did you do? Did you lock the dad in the room with that jackass oncologist so he could convince him to do the chemo while Tracy's unconscious?
you done, Montgomery?
cause once you stop talking, I can.
who's winning, Venus or Serena?
shut up, Cooper.
first, I don't have to explain anything to you.
it's my hospital. I do what I want.
second, my responsibility is to the parents.
and the baby, the actual patient here... - I'm not done talking.
third, the man's been holding vigil by his wife's bedside while his baby lays in an incubator.
he didn't need much convincing, so although you want to believe big, bad bitch Charlotte shut everything down, I didn't.
one parent made a decision, and I am obligated to enforce it, which means the father has spoken, the surgery is off, and I am done with this.
Oh, you know what, Vharlotte? I am not done.
let her go.
breathe.
Lewis is 70, but his life is not over.
he is smart.
he is strong.
he can make it.
there is life outside of prison, and lewis should be a part of it.
I believe he's ready to be a part of it.
Lewis Cartwright is not a threat to society.
in fact, if released, I believe he'd be a model citizen.
what are you doing here?
I'm here to help.
you've done enough.
Thanks.
Lewis, please. Hear me out.
who is Addison to be questioning my motives anyway?
what is she, the motive police?
I don't have to explain anything to her.
I mean, last time I checked, my mama lived in Alabama.
what?
I'm just waiting for you to finish.
say what's on your mind, Cooper?
you don't right fair.
you don't listen to the other side, Charlotte.
you don't hear people out. You don't answer questions.
and when you want to get out of something, you-you know
what are you talking about?
well, with Addison, you just walk away, and with me, you use sex.
you have a problem with that?
Yes!
no.
Yes. We are engaged, and having a discussion about children is important.
and in my mind, I asked you a pretty simple question that you don't seem to want to answer.
I told you we'd discuss it later. What's the big damn deal?
Why? Why later?
see, this is what i'm talking about.
okay, I'm gonna finish this.
you can't just dig your heels in when you don't like the conversation and just say "later" or just walk away.
at least I finished.
what happened to just coffee?
everything's fancier now.
I haven't had to choose what to eat in 40 years.
you know, if it helps, I usually narrow it down to two choices, and then I just choose one from there.
I'll have eggs and bacon.
so do you have a place to live?
I got the name of my probation officer, who's gonna set me up at a halfway house.
the prison gave me two pair of pants and a shirt, and a couple hundred bucks.
I'm thinking it's not enough, but it's a start.
I - I made some calls, too, and I found a job for you.
at a car wash, until you get back on your feet.
what do I owe you?
nothing.
that's not the way it works where I come from.
somebody do you a favor, they expect a favor back.
well, that-that world is behind you now.
you're a free man.
I feel like I've been dropped into some foreign country, and I should speak the language, but I don't.
it's gonna take a while - to adjust, Lewis.
but you will.
come see me.
we can work together... To help you to transition.
okay? I can help you make it, lewis.
I'm here to do a repeat blood count.
we start chemo in the morning.
she's all yours.
I know this isn't your choice, but I really think it's going to work.
it doesn't matter what you think.
Daniel and Tracy came in thinking they were gonna have a healthy baby, and they didn't.
now everything's a mess.
Oh, I didn't peg you as a pessimist.
what?
last month, I had to tell three families about relapses and lost my favorite patient.
but then there was this one woman with lymphoma who walked out of those doors.
that's how it happens.
you focus on the good, on the one, not on the bad.
Tracy Woods-She's awake.
I have two highs - Cutting into people's brains and sex.
when I can't have one, I search for the other.
and right now, nobody's brain needs cutting into.
you're propositioning me for sex?
Yeah.
I'll think about it.
excuse me?
I'll think about it.
I want to see Kyla.
how is she?
she's doing as well as can be expected.
Tracy, I wanted to talk to you about the surgery.
did you already do it?
Daniel didn't tell you?
tell me what?
honey, I called the family, and... What are you doing here?
she's our doctor.
Daniel decided to go with the chemo.
chemo?
but Dr. Montgomery said she could remove the tumor.
maybe, honey.
maybe she can remove the whole tumor.
all right, that oncologist, he told me that Kyla too weak for surgery.
and you agree with this? - No, I don't.
you can't just make this decision without me.
you know what? I just don't want our baby to die.
and I do?! I'm her mother.
Yeah, and I'm her father, damn it.
okay, the time that you waste arguing is time that Kyla is not being treated.
you need to make a decision. What do you both want to do?
I told you. The chemo.
no.
okay, there's only two ways is for this to end.
either one of them goes to court and gets medical power of attorney or...
or... we get them on the same page.
okay. Well, I can try and talk to Daniel.
what?
nothing.
have I told you how beautiful you look in the morning?
okay. Okay, enough with the lips and the hands.
okay. You're freaking out, a...
if you touch me... I can't think.
you're too sexy. Just be ugly or something.
woman. - Okay. Look, I know...
all right, I just gonna say this, all right?
and I know that it's gonna make me sound like a crazy woman, but... but us, you, me, the Addisam, you know, it's just not...
all right. Usually... in a relationship, I can see ahead and see how things are gonna go wrong.
you know, I'm usually five moves ahead or 15 moves ahead, and I can see where it's gonna fall apart, or where the guy is gonna disappoint me, or where he's gonna break my heart, or... but you're perfect.
you have no flaws.
a... and... and I can't see ahead and it's making me crazy.
nothing is going to break us up.
see? Don't say that. That's perfect. You just said the perfect thing.
Daniel and Tracy thought that.
now they're ripping each other apart over their baby.
what do you want me to say?
I don't know. Just try not to be perfect.
okay.
how about this?
I'm not perfect.
I'm just perfect for you.
see?
now I'm gonna have to tear your clothes off and have my way with you, because that was the exact perfect thing.
okay.
Sheldon turned me down for sex.
I figured he would feel like he won the lotto.
and instead, he looks me straight in the face and says...
I'll think about it.
how did you know? - Wild guess.
Oh, it's probably not as good as I think it's gonna be anyway, so...
it is. It's better.
damn it.
the whole "let me think about it," that's pure Sheldon.
that's his game. And from looking at you, it's working like a charm.
what you looking for?
he hasn't called.
who?
the parolee.
I... I told him to come see me.
I'm worried. He's out there by himself.
well, I'm sure he has access to people, resources who can help.
o... okay, look, I...
I know you don't like the idea of me working with a prisoner because of Katie.
but I'm good I'm not afraid.
so worry about Lewis. Don't worry about me.
he's a murderer, Violet.
and that means? - He can't be rehabilitated.
how can you even say that?
my life's work is based on the belief that people can change.
I see it every day.
I say this out of concern for you... don't get involved.
the world's a better place without people like Lewis.
okay, honey, I know you're trying to take care of me, but this is pissing me off.
we care. That's our job. That's who we are.
and this... what you're saying right now, it... it doesn't even sound like you.
this will be Kyla one day, right?
happy, healthy?
Yeah, we hope.
my baby's lying in an incubator with a big tumor in her body, and we're out here fighting.
if Kyla doesn't make it...
Tracy's not gonna be able to live with that, and I cannot lose them both.
you don't have to. - That's easy for you to say.
actually, it's not.
I know why you want to make the safe choice.
no parent wants to see their child go behind those operating room doors and not come out alive.
the waiting feels like it's gonna kill you.
but there comes a time when you need to put your trust in each other and make a decision together, as parents... right or wrong.
you want that?
do the surgery.
if I stop, I'll get fired.
I... I hadn't heard from you, and I just wanted to make sure that you were okay.
I'm making it.
I gave you my card, and I was kind of hoping...
I tossed it. Hey, look, I'm working here.
Lewis, I'm sorry. I'm not here to harass you.
I just wanted to... - Help?
you said that.
look, I don't need a handout.
well, how about a hand up?
look, I... I've been through things myself, and I know how hard it can be, so I just...
I want you to know that I mean it.
and don't come back.
but... - You don't know me.
I could do things to you to make you regret you ever met me.
so for your own good, I would leave and stay as far away from me as possible.
why do you have my child?
I hijacked him from the nanny.
God, he's growing.
so... I think I might have messed up with, uh, Lewis.
who's that, the prison guy?
why do you say that? - He threatened me.
and that is just between you and me, okay?
Pete saying "I told you so" is not what I need right now.
okay, but you need to walk away. You've done enough.
let the guy make his own way.
I am. I'm done.
you think I want to save this guy 'cause I couldn't save Betsey?
do you?
he's like looking into the sun... so gorgeous, it hurts.
Charlotte is acting weird about the baby thing.
what if she never wants kids?
well, you can hijack Lucas whenever you want.
preferably Friday nights so I can have sex with my hot, cranky husband.
Yuck.
don't talk about sex in front of the kid, okay?
he'll end up impotent.
or I will.
motherhood is scary.
she'll come around.
the tumor is even larger and more intertwined than on the C.T.
maybe you should debulk as best you can and get out for now.
no.
I promised I could get it.
Metz.
tumor invaded the artery. It perfed.
Satinsky. I need to clamp the vessel.
I can't get it.
she's hypovolemic.
we lost her pulse.
we got the whole tumor.
it's gone? - Yes.
uh, her lung is fine, and so is her heart.
would you like to see Kyla now?
Yes, please.
that was my plan.
I was just gonna go in the store, hit the register, get some cash.
I never expected anything to go wrong.
but when she saw my gun, she started screaming and screaming.
I knew she'd remember my face, so I shot her, twice in the stomach.
I didn't even wait for her body to drop.
I just ran.
she was a college girl on her way home from school.
just stopped for gas.
Stephanie was her name.
and I wonder all the time...
what would she be doing with her life right now?
would she be married, have kids, a nice job?
and... because she died... you don't feel like you deserve to live your life.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I'm sorry I did that.
it's just that I don't deserve anyone's help.
everybody deserves help, Lewis.
I killed someone.
and you feel like you can't forgive yourself.
and I can never repay it either.
40 years in prison... that's enough.
is it?
it has to be.
if I enjoy a cup of coffee, I feel guilty now.
if I just sit on a park bench and watch the trees blow, I feel guilty about that, too.
and now that I'm free, if I lose myself in a good moment, I feel bad.
but think about all the good things that you've done, all these ways that you've tried to make amends, and you've done this, all the while knowing that you can never really pay for what you did.
you helped other prisoners.
you never caused trouble for anyone else.
you got an education.
you didn't just sit there and do time.
you made something of it.
it's okay to live, Lewis.
live.
Lewis was here.
we had therapy, and he had a breakthrough.
I believe he thinks he can make it now.
that's great, Violet. But be careful.
everybody doesn't respond to therapy.
great. First Pete, and now you. - Pete?
Oh, he has some issue with me working in the prison.
I can come back later.
what was that?
psychology and brain surgery are symbiotic disciplines, and we were thinking about working...
okay, I'm not a good liar.
Amelia propositioned me for sex, and I haven't been able to give her an answer.
what do you think's holding you back?
Amelia and I have said eight words to each other since she joined the practice.
why me?
nice, Violet. Real nice.
Oh, come on.
for most men, this would be like... like a badge of honor.
she made it.
she made it.
Congratulations.
thank you.
can I buy you dinner... and tell you how right you were over and over?
I can't.
but... but thank you.
you... y... you probably don't need to know this, but I have had a string of unsuccessful relationships, and now I have this amazing guy in my life who does amazing things for me, and... you... Well, l...
let's just say that I am focusing on the good, on the one.
I'm not the mommy type.
I don't like kids, and I don't want kids.
and I'm a pediatrician. I love kids. I've always wanted kids. I need to have kids.
they'll like you more than they'll like me.
I'm not... warm.
they will love you.
what if I end up like my mother, drunk at noon, hating the rug rats I'm supposed to love, screwing up our kids, damaging them?
see?
now you're gonna leave me.
this is why I didn't want to talk about this.
Charlotte, I'm... I'm not leaving you.
we're having the conversation, and you didn't walk out, and you didn't shut down, and you didn't try to confuse me with sex.
we're having the conversation.
and we can keep having it.
we don't have to decide right now?
we don't have to decide right now.
what now?
now you can confuse me with sex.
yeah? - Yes, please.
take your clothes off.
I know your game.
you perform like a triathlete in the bedroom to get women in elevators all gossiping about you, you play the insecure, shy, indecisive therapist bit, and in the end, you're the guy who ends up with all the girls that nobody ever saw coming.
you're horrible at taking rejection.
I am not. - Horrible.
you're the baby of the family, right?
that's a little easy. You know what? I take it back.
this whole offer, I... - Let me tell you how this would go.
uh... we'd sleep together.
and at first, it would be just for kicks, but enventually, I'd fall for you, hard.
and then you would do what women like you... the bad girls, the ones who like it dirty, and nasty, and a... a little bit kinky...
you know, the ones with serious daddy issues do, you'd run.
you'd avoid me. You'd be intentionally mean to me.
my savior complex would kick in, so I'd chase you, keep calling you, let you use me for sex on the nights when you were drunk or bored.
but you're too damaged to appreciate the fact that I'm a good guy and I could actually care.
and then one day, I'd show up at your apartment with flowers or something trying to woo you, only to find you on your couch screwing some guy ten years younger than me.
am I wrong?
I don't need it, Amelia.
I'm a grown man looking for a grown woman.
so when you grow up, come find me... because I am as good as they say.
Addisam, huh?
I will not hurt you.
the reason you're always trying to see five steps ahead is because you expect to get hurt.
those other men, they hurt you.
so you're always looking ahead... trying to protect yourself.
there's no protection.
there's no looking ahead.
you're gonna have to trust me.
I will not hurt you, okay?
I will not hurt you.
say it.
you will not... hurt me.
I will not hurt you.
so Lewis called me.
he got a job.
I mean, I went down there to see, and it's not washing cars.
it's good. It's a good job.
it's at a coffee shop. He's making coffee.
the owner said he trusted Lewis' smile, which is...
Yeah, he's gonna be a barista.
last week, he'd never heard of a latte, now he's a barista.
I mean, isn't that just... weird, and great, and somehow hopeful for the world?
like... like no babies in Africa are gonna starve or...
so instead of being home with your son, you're out at 9: 00 at night, hanging with your buddy, the murderer?
no, you di... did you j... you did not just say that, Pete.
okay, Pete, I'm gonna ask you what's going on, and you're gonna tell me.
nothing. There's nothing.
this is not about me being out late.
what's going on? - I don't want to talk about it.
well, you're, uh, married to a therapist, Pete.
I can wait here all night.
I've done the prison thing, okay?
my family... my mother's in jail, and my brother's...
well, I don't really know where he is, but he's probably in jail by now, too, so...
Oh, Pete. - No, I don't want to go there, Violet.
I'm not sharing. I don't want to talk about it. They don't matter.
they're your family. - No.
no.
you and Lucas are my family now.
welcome back, Dr. King. - Thank you.
you're staring at me again.
no, I'm not.
okay, I am.
you ready to talk about it now?
I can't.
you can tell me, whatever it is.
I can keep a secret.
stop staring at me. - You were staring at me first.
you want to play doctor?
I can be the doctor.
you can be the patient.
doctor-patient confidentiality.
Mm. No, no. no, I can't talk about it.
has anyone talked to Charlotte?
I left her a couple of messages, but she--she didn't call me back.
well, what do we say to her? - "get well soon" or "sorry this happened
both seem pretty ridiculous. - Is there a card that says "I'm sorry you got viciously beaten and robbed"?
you need to learn to filter before you speak.
you must have talked to her. - I sent her flowers.
Oh, flowers. Crap. I should've sent her flowers.
Hey! Oh, Charlotte went to the hospital first, but now she's parking downstairs, - so I need-- I need, uh- you need to go to the gym.
shut up. She's gonna be here... any second.
just don't act weird.
you're setting a great example. - Just tell her she looks great.
does she? - No, she looks like she got the crapped kicked out of her...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. - But if we just-- shh.
good morning. - morning.
take a good look then get over it.
if you're gonna be all nervous and annoying around me,
stay the hell outta my way.
What'd I say? I said "don't act weird,
and you all acted weird...Like weird people.
well, I thought it went about as well as could be expected.
I think it's too soon for her to be back.
well, look, I mean, she faced everybody,
clearly stated her needs, she told us off
therapeutically speaking, that's a good day's work.
Violet's right. Either you get swallowed up by that kind of trauma or you try to regain control of your life.
Charlotte's regaining control. Right?
I just got your page.
Elisa, it's gonna be okay.
all right, you're gonna feel a little pinch.
I'm in. Now I just have to drain the fluid.
thank you, Dr. Wilder. - No problem. You did great.
papi, I'm okay. Really.
she isn't, is she? Her cancer's back.
I'm sorry. I think the lymphoma tissue has seeded the pericardium.
we'll have to confirm with a C.T.
please don't worry, Papi.
her body can't take more chemo.
the last two times, she lost all her hair,
her mouth and tongue were covered in ulcers.
I can try something different to treat the side effects.
and, Diego, we've talked about this.
even after a relapse, Elisa's type of lymphoma is curable.
I believe that, but not with western medicine.
chemotherapy is the way to fight this.
there's another way.
I'm taking Elisa to a shaman.
I was thinking about getting a latte, and then, uh,
well, I thought of you, so I went to your office, but you weren't there, - And I thought I'd check downstairs... - You sound like a stalker.
I don't. Well...
okay, I kind of do. But, uh... coffee?
no, thanks.
tea then?
or, um, we could get one of those iced, uh, fruity-chino things.
we're not friends.
you need another pelvic exam to make sure you're healing properly,
not to mention follow-up labs, continued H. I.V. Drugs.
I'll take care of that myself. - Charlotte, you...
all right. We're not friends.
but we could be.
I could be your friend.
I'm the only one who knows what happened,
and I could, I don't know, be there for you or whatever.
I only need one thing from you.
anything. Name it.
keep your damn trap shut about what happened.
his daughter has been through chemo twice, and her cancer is back.
you can't blame Diego for wanting to try something else.
consulting a witch doctor instead of an oncologist borders on child abuse.
shamans have been healing people for thousands of years, Cooper.
so even if you don't believe in it, then - Elisa's mother didn't believe in it.
this would not be an issue if Alice were alive.
she would never let a medicine man try to clear the trauma in Elisa's soul
to restore the balance in her body because it's crap.
you know as well as I do that a person's faith plays a huge role in their recovery.
so if Elisa and Diego believe a shaman can help, then she can.
she is sick, Pete. She needs real help.
she does need help,
and if you want to be a part of it, open your mind.
with all my health problems,
I feel like I've robbed you of your youth.
Oh, my youth was spent just fine.
every week, we come in here, and all I can think about is, it's not fair.
I mean, first it was my diabetes.
you had that long before I met you. It doesn't count.
and then the breast cancer. - Which we beat together.
taking care of me is exhausting.
I see it in you.
and sometimes, I- I'm afraid you'll start to resent me.
Oh, that's crazy. - No, wait, nick, let's talk about that.
how do you relieve the stress that her illness puts on your marriage?
do you exercise? Do you drink?
not for years...
on either count.
you fight?
we fight. Sure. Every couple does.
that's true.
so why is it making you so uncomfortable?
she doesn't mean to, but - nick.
I'm sorry. My last patient was, uh...
I've got some more.
it's okay, honey. - I don't want to talk about it.
she doesn't mean to.
Rachel and Nick" Rachel?
she's been with him for 20 years.
I mean, people get upset in therapy.
no, this was not an emotional outburst, okay?
it was an adrenaline surge.
it... It was the kind of rage you see from an addict.
is she taking drugs? - Yes, but not the kind you think.
we're managing her diabetes and the kidney problems that causes.
but she's not a junkie.
in fact, she's the most resilient woman I know.
she never complains about her health, never stops trying.
no, no, she's incredible. - She's abusive.
Sheldon, come on. She was a ballerina,
and Nick looks like a lumberjack.
really, I mean, how badly can she really hurt him? - Abuse is abuse.
would we be having this conversation If Rachel were the one being hit instead of Nick?
Sheldon - I'm serious.
would you tell a woman to stay with an abusive spouse?
no, but this is-- okay, this feels different.
Rachel and Nick are not a cautionary tale.
they're a love story. - You ever heard of Judith and holofernes?
famous love story-- ends with Judith chopping off the head of her beloved.
you know, Florence-- great paintings by Rubens and Rembrandt?
you should see 'em.
what? - Nothing. You're just... A little odd and pretentious.
but I'm not wrong. Something's going on with Rachel.
what's wrong, Coop? - Shamans.
shamans.
and Charlotte. - Shamans and Charlotte?
no--No, no. Mostly Charlotte.
she's having nightmares. She wakes up screaming.
I try to get her to eat. She says she's not hungry.
I try to talk about the police investigation,
she just... Shuts me down.
well, she's trying to put herself back together in her own way, Coop.
I mean, there's no blueprint for any of this.- Yeah. No, I-I know that.
everyone handles trauma differently. It takes time to heal.
you gotta put one foot in front of the blah, blah, blah.
wow, I'm glad to see you hold the tools of my profession in such high regard.
well, none of that helps me, Violet. - Well, it's not about you, Cooper.
it's about Charlotte. - So you're saying...
back off. - Oh, you're a bad shrink.
can I hide out here for a while? - Yeah, as long as you want.
I have to report the abuse, Nick.
if you say anything,
I'll deny it.
she's hitting you. - Most of the time, she's fine.
and when she's not, I can handle her.
for now. But what I saw... She could hurt you.
are you married, Dr. Wallace?
no.
then with all due respect,
you can't understand.
I met her right out of journalism school.
I was a reporter for the "Tim" Times.
got tagged to cover a performance of "swan lake.
what the hell did I know about ballet, right?
but when I saw her dance,
I don't know, she was just... Mesmerizing.
she has this quality like, when you're with her,
nothing else matters.
I won't give up on her...
not ever.
who sent you to spy on me?
Cooper? Addison?
I came looking for you on my own. I figured your day was probably pretty weird,
and you might need some sugary, deep-fried batter.
so are you - If you ask me if I'm okay, I swear to god,
I'll take this cast and knock you upside the head.
I wasn't gonna ask you that.
when I first kicked drugs, I,uh, took up running.
I mean, an addict's gotta be addicted to something, right?
so I would get up when it was still dark,
and I would go for miles.
until the morning I got clipped by a minivan.
I didn't get anything like the injuries that you have,
but I started craving pills again.
so...I was thinking that maybe you were craving pills again.
I took your advice, and I'm back at meetings, - And if you wanna go - I grew up wrestling two brothers.
I have an incredibly high pain threshold.
anything else?
can-- can you hold that?
I got Nick to agree to bring Rachel in.
would you check her out? - Of course.
okay.
it's been a while since we discussed man troubles,
and... I- I was beginning to think that you found another therapist.
Oh. No, I-I... I want to talk about Charlotte.
do you think she's okay? Because I don't.
but she won't listen to me. - I didn't realize you two were close.
well, we're not exactly, but... I was there that night,
and... It was horrific.
and if it was Nai or Amelia, I'd know what to do.
but because it's Charlotte-- She's just not interested.
it's because you were there that night.
no, she wanted me there. - No, at the time, yes, but you saw her when she was in her most fragile state,
which means you're the living breathing reminder of what happened.
when she sees you, she's that victim again.
I just want to help.
well, then you'll need to find a more indirect way to do it.
thank you for allowing us to observe.
I brought something for Elisa.
the medicine men I've worked with say that quartz is a very powerful healer.
so you understand my beliefs?
I worked with a shaman in the Congo to treat an outbreak of measles.
and you think it was the shaman that cured those people, not the vaccinations?
maybe it was one thing, maybe it was both.
either way, people got better.
I know you think I'm crazy, Dr. Freedman.
but my only concern is that Elisa get well.
we tried western medicine. It failed. - It kept her alive.
it killed my wife. - Alice died of an aneurysm that ruptured.
nobody could've saved her. And Elisa-- she can still be saved.
papi, is she okay? - Elisa?
she needs help. She's getting help.
it's just the bad energy leaving her body. - I'm not getting a pulse.
leave her alone. - I'm calling an ambulance.
stop it! Let the shaman finish. - Elisa, stay with me now. Come on.
is Elisa okay? - Yes.
she was in hypotensive shock by the time the ambulance got here,
so she needed surgery to make a small incision
in the sac around the heart to drain the fluid.
she's in recovery now. - Can she come home?
she's gonna have to stay here for a few more days.
also, I'd like to keep her under observation while we start chemo.
you brought Elisa here against my wishes. I want her discharged.
no, she can't go anyplace until the surgical drain's removed.
do you understand what's happening?
she has a tube draining fluid out of her heart,
and she has a tumor that's getting larger every day, - And no shaman can stop that. - Elisa is my daughter,
and I will decide what medical treatment she
not if you're incapable of making responsible decisions.
alternative therapies work, Cooper. I've seen patients cured.
with the right combination of homeopathic remedies,
elisa can get the kind of treatment that Diego wants.
enough. I'm sorry. I don't care what Diego wants.
I'm getting a judge to order Elisa's chemo.- No, you-- you can't do that.
Yes, I can, and I will.
Sam, I have to tell you something. - Now?
do you wanna know my secret or do you want to have sex with me?
well, both would-- both would be good.
I did something the other night...
a rape kit.
okay, we really need to work on your pillow talk.
well, technically, it was just some washings,
but see the thing is, is that the victim didn't want it.
wait. What? - She was... upset,
and I... thought she might want the D.N.A. Later,
so I went ahead and did it anyway,
but then I didn't tell her. And then I labeled it "Jane doe
and I locked it in the hospital refrigerator,
but... But I didn't report it.
well, that's illegal. Why wouldn't you...
because Charlotte made you promise.
you're staring at me.
I'm sorry.
and yet, you're still staring at me.
it's what we do-- the Addison and Sam.
we, uh, we do that.
Oh, god. I'm starting to sound like her, aren't I?
Oh, brother.- O-okay.
okay, um...
I have a thing...
that I can't tell you or anyone.
so I'm not gonna tell you.
but I need for you to get what I'm saying.
whoa. Did I black out for a minute? Because y-you are not making any sense.
okay. Uh... Talk to charlotte.
she wants to be left alone.
well, since when has that ever stopped you?
I mean, let's face it, Violet, you're--you're kinda nosy.
I am not. I-- I am-- I'm interested.
okay, talk to Charlotte.
she needs help.
and you are a shrink,
so... Do what shrinks do.
I saw Elisa this morning.
she's hanging in there.
no thanks to her crazy ass father.
you really think taking him to court is the right thing to do?
I had to do something. He was threatening to take her home.
if Diego tells the judge He's refusing treatment on religious grounds, you'll lose.
not necessarily. California Supreme Court prosecuted a mother whose child died of meningitis.
she'd refused lifesaving medical treatment In favor of divine healing.
look, I get that you're worried about Elisa.
I am, too.
but you're not gonna help her by tearing her family apart.
if Diego won't look out for his daughter's best interests, I will.
I don't know what I would do if she was my kid.
but Elisa and Diego have a right to follow their beliefs.
they're not crazy, cooper. They're just different.
and if you take them to court to force chemo...
I'll testify on their behalf.
he never complains.
his only concern is that I'll get hurt.
I don't mean to get so angry.
I just can't control myself.
okay. Enough whining. What do you think's going on?
well, there's nothing on the head M.R.I. Or chest C.T.
but I did find a high level of testosterone in your blood,
which could be caused by a tumor of the adrenal glands or lungs, - but I ruled that out... - Oh, that's good news.
or by metastatic breast cancer.
But...I-I had a mastectomy ten years ago.
I know, but sometimes, breast cancer cells can get left behind and grow somewhere else.
that could be a tumor on your ovary,
and if it's secreting testosterone, that buildup could cause sudden rages.
are you sure?
the only way to know for sure would be to go in and take a look,
but surgery is a big gamble for someone in your health.
I don't care. I want to do it for Nick.
please, Dr. Montgomery.
I-I can't hurt my husband anymore.
you got a minute?
what for? - It's been a few days.
I should take a look at your injuries.
they're fine. - Then this will be fast.
we can do it here or we could go to an exam room.
let's just get this over with.
everything is healing up beautifully.
told ya.
okay. Let's take a look at your back.
Oh, here. I got it. I got it.
Oh. Cooper did a crap job changing this bandage.
he didn't do it. I did.
I got it.
when it needs to be changed again, let me know.
Hey. Sorry I had to run out so early this morning.
you want to have lunch?
what is it with you people and food?
I don't want coffee or tea or doughnuts.
can't you just leave me alone?
I was just trying to be thoughtful.
no, you came in here to check on me.
I want you to stop hovering. - I'm not hovering.
all I need is for you and everybody else to back off.
I'm in this with you. - You are not inside this, Cooper.
you have no idea.
and now the way you're looking at me... Just stop.
I can't take it. I can't breathe.
Charlotte.
Dr. Montgomery will remove Rachel's tumor, then stage it to determine the necessary post-operative treatment,
and if all goes well, Rachel's testosterone levels will decrease, - And she'll have more control over her anger. - Good. That's good.
but if the surgery isn't successful, - And Rachel's rages continue - We'll get through it.
the love you and Rachel have for each other, it's a gift.
and under normal circumstances,
I would work to keep this marriage healthy another 50 years.
but sometimes...
sometimes I have to counsel people to walk away.
no one stays together anymore.
they just... Have a fight, get a divorce,
pretend like it never happened.
when instead, they should be fighting for each other,
through whatever comes.
this is what love is supposed to be.
I'm never walking away.
Hey, Elisa. How you feeling?
much, much better. I'm ready to go home now.
you need to heal a bit more first.
papi told me Dr. Freedman is bringing in a judge.
please. I don't want chemo.
do you believe a shaman can heal you?
papi does. - No, no, forget your father and Dr. Freedman.
I want to know what you believe.
if you have faith in a shaman,
I will back you with the judge.
it's okay. You can tell me.
Elisa, what is it?
I don't want chemo.
how long you been out here? - I don't know.
I couldn't sleep.
Hey. It's gonna be okay.
not if Violet doesn't talk to Charlotte. - She will.
what if somebody decides to look in the lab fridge,
you know, and they wonder what the "Jane doe" bag is?
I don't know what I was thinking.
you were thinking that you wanted to help a friend.
I could lose my license, Sam.
I mean, what-- what am I supposed to do?
we wait.
violet will come through.
that fresh?
I just made it.
help yourself.
thank you, Sheldon.
for what?
leaving me alone.
I wish everybody else would just, uh...
do nothing.
I'd do nothing for you anytime.
you know that, right?
I do.
how's it going? - Just dandy, thanks.
you know, I,uh...
I know how hard it can be to reintegrate after you've been...
victimized, so if you ever want to talk...
you always been such a busybody
or is that just a professional hazard?
no, actually, Charlotte, I...
I truly believe in the therapeutic process.
and after Katie attacked me
you think because a crazy woman cut out your baby,
you got some kind of an insight into what makes me tick?
you don't.
all you got's a nasty scar and a horror story.
you're damaged goods, Violet. You...
not me.
you got no business telling anybody how to run their lives.
have you got any tips for getting a 14-yea-old to talk?
I really want to go to bat for Elisa,
but she's holding something back.
well, she's a kid, and even as adults we're...
reluctant to... say certain things out loud.
you know, it makes it real, and then, you know...
you have to deal with it. - I wouldn't know anything about that.
Pete Wilder-- open book.
I know. It's not fair.
I push you to tell me things, and then I have stuff myself.
there was...
well, it happened a long time ago,
in college, and I never told you.
violet, I know.
or at least I suspected.
we have been through...a lot.
and I've seen you react in so many ways.
why didn't you say anything?
I figured that when you were ready to talk about it, you would.
Oh, I'm probably wrong. - What?
well, you were the first one to see her that night.
is it possible?
was Charlotte raped?
if she told me, you know I couldn't
no, I know, I know, of course. But...
but what do you think?
I think you're right.
don't.
what can I do?
what do you need?
lay really close to me...
but don't touch me.
it's been a long time Since I wore a pair of these.
what are you doing here?
I came to wish you luck. - Thanks.
you know, Nick and Rachel, they're special.
a lot of couples stay together for the long haul, but not many stay in love.
your parents still married?
no, no, they split when I was a teenager.
you close to them? - I call my mother every week, but my father and I...
well, let's just say that when you wash out of your E.R. Rotation
and you're a surgeon's son, it doesn't help the relationship.
I guess it could make you a little odd and a little pretentious.
who's to say those are bad things?
I'll call you when it's over.
Alice believed in chemo, and I believed in Alice,
so that's what we did.
but she's gone now.
I've seen the shaman heal people.
I think she can do the same for my Elisa.
what do you want, Elisa?
what papi wants. - What about your mother?
Alice would've pushed for this chemo. She wouldn't want you to die.
don't say that. How dare you say that. She's not gonna die.
you honor, what Diego is asking for may seem unconventional, but I have seen it work.
as an M.D. and also a practitioner of alternative therapies, I urge you,
please, don't disregard what Diego is asking for.
the only guaranteed cure for lymphoma is chemotherapy.
I need to take the family's religious beliefs into account
okay, but what kind of father just stands by and doesn't save their child?
stop it. Please, Dr. Freedman.
if I have more chemo, my family won't make it.
we're living in a trailer park because of me.
my treatments bankrupted us,
and papi had to sell the house.
I hear you on the phone, begging to keep the power on.
I see you skipping meals so the rest of us can eat.
Carlos and Pilar... They deserve a life
that doesn't revolve around my hospital visits.
and so do you.
the shaman will save you. - No, she won't.
I'm sorry, papi. I don't believe what you believe.
I'm not afraid.
let the shaman take me to mama.
I think we all know what needs to be done.
do you think I don't know what's true anymore because I was attacked?
I think working through that experience has made you a better therapist.
Sam told me I should talk to Charlotte. - Well, that's not surprising.
you both survived a brutal trauma. - Yeah, yeah, but the way he said it,
it was like there was more to it than that.
and then I- I just started projecting my own stuff on her.
well, what sort of stuff?
I wish you had been there... that night,
then we could compare notes.
unfortunately I spent the night in an interrogation room
getting throttled by a rapist, so...
is that what...
do you think Charlotte was raped?
the judge ordered the chemo. You didn't have to arrange this.
I know.
I'm just saying-- I'm not completely unreasonable.
thank you for letting us bend the rules.
I made sure she wasn't gonna sacrifice a chicken or anything.
I know I should leave you alone.
but here's the thing-- I can't.
you're not ready.
Cooper - I know you.
it didn't go well, did it?
the tumor was worse than the imaging originally showed.
I couldn't resect it all. I removed what I could.
no. I can't accept that.
you have to stop the cancer.
h- how long do I have?
not as long as you'd want.
there are testosterone blocking agents we could try to manage your anger,
but... They're not very effective.
uh, so I'm just gonna keep on hurting Nick?
there's nothing I can do?
you can move into hospice for around-the-clock care
with people who know how to manage your anger and who'll keep you safe.
what the hell are you talking about?
don't listen to him, Rachel. We can manage at home.
you know that's not true, love.
I'm dying.
you don't know how long you have.
I want that time with you.
I don't care what you do to me.
but I do.
those people at hospice, they won't know how to take care of you.
I've learned that over the past 20 years. I'm good at it.
well, then you'll tell them how, every day,
when you come to visit.
you'll find a place where I can go?
Yes. I promise.
it's the right thing, Nick.
you know it is.
please...
let me take care of you for once.
Yeah.
you need something?
it was an Indian summer...
my junior year in college.
and I'd left the window open because it was the only way
to cool down enough to get to sleep.
so when I first felt his breath on me...
I thought, finally, a breeze.
and then I opened my eyes.
he wrapped one hand around my throat,
and with the other, ripped off my panties.
he whispered to me...
shh, shh, shh, shh,
like, um...
like you do to a child having a bad dream.
he told me not to make a sound.
and when he finished, he...slammed my head against the wall
till my hair was sticky with blood.
I thought...
that...
if I stayed quiet, then I'd be okay...
like it never happened.
because things that like, well...
they don't happen to people like me...
or to people like you.
so...
I just wanted you to know...
that I get it. I get it, Charlotte.
and I'm here for you.
Shelly, what are you doing here?
the guy I evaluated last week-- Lee Mchenry?
Yeah.
I think I know who he raped.
Yes, this is, uh, Dr. Addison Montgomery at St. Ambrose.
I have pelvic washings from a rape that need to be processed.
Charlotte. - What happened?
will you go to a meeting with me?
I'm right behind you.
hello. That guy is lookin' at you.
you wanna try talkin' to him?
sure. Should I lead with,"hey, one day I could be in a diaper. Want to go out"?
or maybe I should go with the crazy facial ticks, The tremors...
the dementia.
watching my mother die of huntington's, I can tell you...
no oants to be a part of it.
but you don't even know you have the gene. - And I prefer i don't know.
but you're living like you already have the disease.
just take the test. Know for sure.
good morning.
african flame lilies.
Gabriel. - They're the national flower of zimbabwe.
I had to go through six importers to get them here.
I-I know what they are. What are you doing here?
the newspaper said you were in the capital--harare
donating an m. R.I.courtesy of what's his face.
william white. You're doing a good job handing out his money.
I'm gonna ask you again. What are you doing here?
I gave you time to mourn. - How magnanimous of you.
Oh, come on, naomi. We were good together. I missed you.
last time I saw you, You yelled at me and you just rolled off.
rolled? Really, nai? - That's not what I meant.
he's gone, and I'm back, so let the wooing begin.
Hey, sam. Who's the new girl?
it's only been a few days, coop, but... - It seemed longer?
Yeah. I hit a wall with the captain and archer.
Oh, well, that makes sense. Ooh, I can see that.
I-I know it wasn't easy for you guys, either, But so you know, I,uh...
I appreciate it.
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want- ignore this. Ever since bizzy died,
this has just been happening. So I'm fine. Ignore me.
Hey, you are never gonna guess who...
Addison. - I'm fine.
I-I'm sorry. Are you okay? - No, it's, uh, transient tears.
who-- who showed up? Spill.
okay. Fife. - Hey. How's he doing?
he's exactly the same.
snarky, aggressive, self-involved?
pretty much. - Oh, he's not that bad.
Yeah, I didn't realize how much I missed him.
well, he certainly caught you in the right mood.
sorry. The bitchiness, it comes with the tears. I can't control it.
Addison, if you-- if you want to talk about archer, I
no, I want to talk about fife.
so did it stir up some old feelings for you?
I don't know. It's, you know, too early to tell. I don't know. You know, maybe.
Hey, lady. Welcome back. - Thank you.
I was just about to call you.
I have a patient who came to the hospital looking for you.
fancy. - They wanted you, too.
what's the issue?
Frank and isobelle's baby has Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
Dr. Montgomery, your in utero surgeries have been well-publicized.
well, unfortunately, due to the severity of this case, Your baby's heart isn't strong enough
to pump blood through her body, so no surgery-- In utero or otherwise-- will help.
and we understand, she'll die within a day of her birth.
we won't get to be parents to her, But there is a way that we can keep more than just her memory.
we've done IVF. Three times.
miscarried twice
she was our last embryo, And I have no more eggs left.
but our baby, she has hundreds already.
but eggs don't mature until adolescence.
actually, we've done quite a bit of research,
and, um, if an ovary is treated with hormones,
it can speed up the maturation process.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure what you're asking.
we're asking you to remove our baby's ovary
I want another chance at motherhood.
hot?
do you think they're too hot? - Oh, how could you be too hot?
my publisher said the jacket photo is really important.
people see the author, and it gives them a sense of what they're gonna get if they buy the book.
well, I'd buy pretty much anything from this woman.
I'm serious. - So am I.
Hey, tonight, um, maybe you could wear this dress?
and I could pretend that I was a fan at the book signing
and the bookstore was closing.
okay... First of all, that's not my dress.
what? - Second of all, it would take a stylist and an hour to get my hair to look that way again.
these don't even look like me.
they got you all worked up.
you know what? I think you like the fake, glammed-up me Better than the real thing.
Oh, come on, violet. Stop it.
you know what? These-- these are no good. And you're no good. Get out. Get out.
I'm-- I-- I-- you got-- No, I cannot possibly get in trouble for thinking that you
you know what? Get out. Get out. If you like them so much... take them with you.
okay. Thank you.
wait. What? - They want to use their baby as an egg farm.
severe hypoplastic left heart syndrome is a death sentence.
well, yes. We're all gonna die eventually, but I doubt
that means that you're prepared to donate an organ today.
stop. You're not seriously discussing this?
Charlotte, you can't let that happen at st. Ambrose. - Why not?
look, if it's publicity you're after and--and you think This is gonna translate into funds,
then I can have the foundation give the hospital money.
would it achieve notoriety for the hospital? Absolutely.
would we be effectively performing a miracle? Yes.
and most importantly, we could be altering Assisted reproductive technology forever.
that's why I want to do it. - But it is morally wrong.
not everyone shares your compass.
but you know that.
Addison, if there's something personal that you want
okay, could we just stay on topic for a second? You are going way off the rails here.
in utero surgery can rupture the mother's uterus, right? - It could.
which she would need if she wants to-- - Carry her baby's baby.
I was gonna say have another baby, but, you know, yuck.
what if we wait till the baby's born? - So that a baby that's gonna live maybe a day
can spend that day enduring painful abdominal surgery?
the cards are dealt.
I'm just suggesting We create something good out of a nasty situation.
we shouldn't do this. Addison, you shouldn't do this.
Hey, long night? - I was out with my friend michelle.
I finally convinced her To take the huntington's DNA. Test.
is she seeing violet or sheldon? - Neither.
I told her to come in, we'd just do the test, Find out one way or another.
there's a 50% chance she'll find out she's gonna die, ameli - She needs counseling before that test. - She's strong. She'll be fine.
this is why doctor's shouldn't treat their friends.
I'm doing this because I'm her friend.
I'm thinking I want to check out naples.
it's time for another stamp on my passport.
Ooh, Italian men. Spicy. When you gonna go?
if I'm negative, I'll go in the fall.
if I'm positive, it's all over, right?
no, if you're positive, You'll have 10 years, 20, maybe more.
I know how it works-- Early onset, late onset, every complication.
there's all sorts of ifs, but one thing is for sure.
from the day my mother was diagnosed, it was a nightmare
that got worse and worse until the day that she died.
and that was a relief. And I...
I don't want to wait for the horror show to start.
what does that mean?
if I'm positive, I'm gonna kill myself.
all right. I know that-- - I think that
you first.
things are a little tense... After, uh...
our night on the deck.
it was-- it was... Just felt comfortable...
and, uh, familiar, and we were just nostalgic.
and that's okay. I-- - Don't tronize me, naomi.
okay? I'm not chasing after you.
I just want to know if you think it was something more than nostalgia.
or are you still thinking about archer?
uh, no, sam. No.
so you mean to tell me that you didn't feel anything when we were out there all alone...
aren't you two supposed to be divorced?
goo-goo eyes, hushed tones...
it's good to see you, gabriel.
you don't mean that. - No, I don't.
did she tell you about the african lilies?
I thought they were impactful. Speaking of which
she's allergic. Okay. Well, I've got patients.
I'm sure you two have a lot of catching up to do.
have dinner with me tonight?- I-I can't.
lunch? - No, I-- there's no time.
I will sit here and continue to propose meals, Espresso, crudits,
whatever it takes-- until you say yes.
I'm very patient.
I already told you. I like that first set of pictures.
come on, cooper. Help me. Which one?
see, I know how this turns out. I say,"the blue one looks nice," And you say,"just nice not great"?
and then I say,"no. You look great in everything you wear."
and then you say, "you don't really sound like you mean that."
so I say,"no, it's not that. I just like the other one better." And then we get to the part where you say, "you think I look fat in this, don't you?" And then I'm sleeping on the couch.
you do realize that I'm not charlotte?
if you asked for help, I would at least take it seriously.
this is important to me. Please.
okay. The blue one. - Ooh, you think so?
Hey, sheldon. Do you have a minute?
don't pick the blue one.
I am busy. We just need a minute.
we? - please.
Dr. Montgomery, we are considered to be a family.
giving birth, uh, is not the only way.
have you two discussed adoption? - I need to be a mother to a child that came from inside of me, a child that is a part of us.
it may be irrational, but-- - I understand that you want to have a baby.
Frank and I have been togetr 20 years.
and at first, we were young. You know, we wanted to do things,
and then our careers-- you get off the fast track, You lose your place.
finally, we were ready, and after spending Every dime we had on IVF.
two miscarriages in the second trimester.
but when this baby finally made it to 24 weeks, We-- we thought...
we--we thought it would be okay. But it's not,
because our baby will be lucky to get a full day of life.
so either god really hates us,
or she made it this far for a reason.
you know, women think that they can have it all.
they can just wait and decide when the time is right, But we're wrong.
okay. - You'll do it?
I can't guarantee that it'll work. It's never been done before.
and I won't risk your life or risk perforating your uterus,
so I will do the surgery, but after your baby's born, Not before.
thank you.
you okay?
Michelle's test results.
I'm sorry. - I pushed her...
to find out, and now...
she's gonna kill herself, pete. - She's going to be devastated, but
no, she has already decided. - People say things. They
Michelle knows what is coming. She saw what it did to her mother.
I mean, she has seen the clumsiness,
then it gets hard to swallow, your muscles go rigid, The seizures and dementia
I mean, I don't blame her, But I have been through this before
losing somebody close to me way too soon. And maybe it is selfish
it's not selfish. You care about her.
but as good a friend as you are, it's not enough anymore.
you need to get her some help. Now.
no, I am serious. Where'd you go?
I got a giant grant from the only place That has more money than you now.
the government. - Impressive.
no, what's impressive is, I left my big, fancy office at the n. I.H.
with lots of cute little doctors fawning over me To come back and get you.
to get me? - Come on, naomi. We have great chemistry.
you can't argue with science.
I'm... Very fond of you ,But, uh...
this just isn't the right time.
please don't tell me I'm competing with a dead man.
with william? No. No, I just...
um... My life has certain complications right now.
Oh - Oh? What "oh"?
that's code for "sam." - No. No. No.
Naomi, you can talk to me, about anything, Even sam.
if you want to woo me, Discussing my ex-husband I is not a good way to do it.
okay?
you gonna do something? - I don't know.
well, I want a banana.
you know, it's customary For the boyfriend to offer comfort in this situation.
well, my comfort isn't always... Comforting.
well, sometimes you just have to plow through it.
and sometimes you just need to avoid.
thank you.
Oh, keep it. Really.
okay. - You know, I'm--I'm okay, you know.
I mean, it's not like we were close or anything.
well, sometimes that makes it harder than when the relationship was good
and there were no unresolved issues,
nothing left unsaid.
I am crying because we're out of sweetener.But it's not like anything's even setting this off.
I mean, it's-- it's like my tear ducts Are acting on their own.
I just... I just want it to be over.
grief has its own timeline.
wait, wait, wait. What does that mean?
you can't get off till the ride stops.
even in college, you had a killer poker face.
Michelle-- - You know, the day my mother was diagnosed was the worst day of my life, But today-- today could actually top it.
okay.
I'm ready.
you're negative. - What?
you don't have it. You're not gonna get huntington's disease.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god! Oh, my god.
you lied to her about the test results?
Pete, I told you. She said she would kill herself, and she was serious.
and I told you that when you have a suicidal patient, You refer them to a therapist.
you don't lie. - No, you do
when it is in the best interest of your patient.
you're letting your friendship get in the way Of your medical training.
you're just trying to justify this.
you were right. You are being selfish.
one day--maybe sooner, maybe later
but one day she is gonna die a shell of who she is.
but right now, michelle is healthy and happy,
and she can stay that way for ten years, even more.
so as her doctor and as her friend, I need to protect her from pain for as long as I can, Because neither of us wants to give up yet,
not while she can still go out dancing and travel
and tell jokes that are so many that they pull me out of the blackest places I go.
as long as there is no treatment for huntington's disease
the best medicine that I can offer her is to tell her that she won't get it at all.
what are you gonna tell michelle when she wakes up with symptoms?
I'm gonna ask... Did you enjoy the time you had?
and hope to got she says yes.
Hey. Oh, cookies.
Oh, my god. These are good. They're crunchy, but the chocolate's still soft.
I know. I'm keeping 'em over there 'cause I already had three.
better be from a grateful patient And not some secret boyfriend.
we're forever thankful for your help. Frank and isobelle.
no.
Addison's gonna wait until after the baby's born
that's worse, charlotte! It's a baby! With a life
a tragically short one, but that is a life.
how are we not on the same side here?
because you're ignoring the fact That this could help make another longer life.
I can't believe you'd be a part of this.
so my publisher needed these, like, yesterday.
any of these work? - Well, you look great.
Really? You kidding? - You look trustworthy, smart.
Yes, definitely. Trustworthy and smart.
Cooper? - Yeah, they're good. What's with the book?
it's a psychology textbook. - I can see that,
but how often do you sit at the edge of your desk With it in your hand like that?
well, the photographer thought this staging Would make me look more... Respectable.
what, you don't like it? - No.
it's just, you look like you're about Two seconds away from hurling it at a patient.
well, you do look a bit intense.
which is not necessarily a bad thing. Is it?
I'd buy a book written by this woman, In fact, I'd even pay hardcover price.
but if you're asking... This isn't you, violet.
you're not some uptight, stodgy therapist who looks like this.
you're open and welcoming.
you sit on your couch all curled up drinking tea, Making people feel like they know you.
I mean, that's who you are. It's a good thing. It's-- it's why your patients love you.
do you have a minute? - Oh, isobelle's water just broke.
I was just on my way to the hospital to check on her.
Addison, you're really gonna do this? You're gonna harvest that baby's eggs?
that baby's gonna die. At least this way, isobelle and frank
no, no, just forget about them. They are blinded by their desire to become parents
a desire which they clearly do not understand.
who does understand it?
it's some psycho-biogical impulse That's hardwired into us.
well, it's also a responsibility. - That they seem fully prepared to accept.
I mean, nai, where-- where is this coming from?
you've devoted your whole life to helping women Who can't conceive on their own conceive.
no, this is different. It's experimental. - No, this is nazi germany
and--and tuskegee all rolled into one. We are scientists trying to progress.
they want a baby. We might be able to give them one.
by allowing them to treat the baby that they have now
like it's already dead?
Addison, you can't do this. - I want to.
But--o-okay. For whom?
Addison... You're grieving your mother,
and you desperately want a baby, And if you can help them, maybe it means
that down the road, you might get one, too.
I know you're not questioning my judgment.
maybe I am. You've been questioning mine.
there are lines that we shouldn't cross.
unless our teenage daughter becomes pregnant.
when did I stop knowing you?
do you have a minute? - Do I have a choice?
I'm-- I'm not a romantic person. - Here it comes.
I'm --I'm a practical p erson. I'm the person who looks around
and sees what needs to be accomplished, And then gets it done.
when william was dying, I-I fed him, And I cleaned him, and I did what I had to do.
when my marriage to sam was over,
I was the one who took care of all the details So that we could both just move on.
you carry a lot of responsibility.
Anaddison-- you know, I...
I have loved her like a sister,
and I have forgiven her all her flaws Because I know that she is doing the best that she can.
again, a heavy burden. - And it feels heavy. God.
why is it then That when--when I was-- when I was traveling the world
and--and doing all of the foundation business And solving serious problems,
I-I... I felt so light?
because the problems you were solving Weren't your own.
Yeah.
fife says he's in love with me.
well, how do you feel about that?
well, you know, he makes me laugh, and that feels good.
recently, sam and I had a...
a moment, And, uh, I don't know.
no. You know what? No. I-I do not want to revisit the past. I just
so, uh, what do you want? - I don't know. I want simple.
I-I want to go And build hospitals in india.
I want to vaccinate african children.
is that all? So go build and vaccinate And--and--and just...
go.
it's ok isobelle. - It hurts. Is it supposed to hurt that much?
unfortunately, yes. keep breathing. Try to stay calm.
the baby's cord is prolapsed. The baby's in distress. We need to do a c-section.
Oh, help her! Please help our baby. - Okay, okay. You're okay. You're okay.
what?
as a recovering addict, You know...
honesty is always the best choice.
this from a man who tried to convince me
a patient could see when she was actually still blind?
so pete told me about your friend. I'm so sorry.
thank you.
but you shouldn't have lied to her.
she's living her life. I'm helping her.
you're deceiving her, And--and she's living someone else's life.
of course you would take his side. - No, I'm- I'm taking your friend's side.
she's--she's gonna need people that she can trust Down the line when she becomes symptomatic.
I hope she can still trust you.
if I tell her the truth, she will take her own life.
well... Show her a reason to live
and bring her in here Where she can get the therapy she really needs.
can I help you?
Naomi can't move forward while you're still holding on.
or she's just not that into you.
you had her and you let her go. That was your mistake.
now you need to do the right thing for her.
you mean for you - I mean for all of us.
you are an arrogant bastard. Why don't you go back to where you came from?
I intend to, with naomi.
is she okay? I mean, I know that she's...
but is she okay? - She is resting.
have you thought about a name? - When can you do the surgery?
W-wouldn't you like to meet her first? - Just remove her ovaries.
you said you would do it. We need you to do it now.
you can't tell, you know? She looks just like all the other preemies.
I wonder what she would've grown up to be. - Cooper, don't. Don't go there.
how can you not?
I have to take her now.
here we go. where are the parents?
they don't want to meet her.
Oh, they're cowards. They're wors - It's their right. - What about her rights? What about her life?
she won't last the day. - So what?
we're all gonna die. We have no idea when. And they just...
they say they want to be parents, But parenting is more than onesies and bassinets.
it's a lifelong commitment, No matter how long or short that life is.
they don't deserve her.
okay. All right.
Sheldon. - Hey.
just the man I've been looking for. - Oh, sorry. I'm busy.
it'll just take a sec. - I said no, charlotte.
I am sorry, But I am tired of being the sounding board For all the women around here.
I can't solve everyone's problems, nor do I want to. I have a life of my own.
listen, I'm a man and a therapist. I like to believe that that makes me sensitive.
but do I care what dress you wear?
I mean, I've become the guy who's not your boyfriend,Who gets treated like a boyfriend when it comes to
the annoying things that boyfriends don't want To deal with, but they have to because if they don't,
they don't get any sex, but still... I just
please just keep your problems to yourself, Or at least just away from me.
I am resigning as the not-boyfriend boyfriend.
well, I'm sorry to hear that.
pass it on. - I will.
fund-raiser for the pediatric oncology unit.
I-I guess I'll get your check another time.
you pledged $1, 000.
you need to step up with your women. - Mine's not complaining.
you both have amazing women in your lives,
you get all the perks, but you need to be there For the neuroses and the insecurities and the existential crises that plague them.
I-I don't want to pick out violet's photo shoot wardrobe.
and-- and addison is grieving and naomi is
Naomi's not one of ours.
what? - I - I can't be the not-boyfriend boyfriend.
Just--not anymore.
it sounds to me like you just need to be a boyfriend.
look, I live with violet's neuroses every day And evernight.
and sam gets more than his share
this is not about us. What he's trying to say is,
you need to find a woman of your own.
but since, according to you, I have two, I'm the expert,
and I say, join a monastery.
guess what I just did. new sundress for naples.
and-- new hat. Wanna come?
I lied.
about the test. You have the huntington's gene.
but y-you said... - I know. I'm sorry.
you lied to me? - I was just afraid.
you said you'd kill yourself, and...
don't, because if you hug me right now, You're doing it because you're sad for me,
but you can't be sad for me before I'm sad for me,
and I can't be sad for me, because...
I'm too scared to be sad.
I am so scared.
Michelle-- - I never want to see you again.
what are you doing? - This is your baby.
maybe not the one you hoped for, but... She's still yours.
no, please. Please don't-- don't do this.
you said you were desperate to be parents. Are you?
don't you get it? If--if we don't
we loved every baby that didn't come to be. We named the first two-- david and rebecca.
but now... we... - If-- if we meet her, we'll bond.
you want to be parents, right? - Not for a day.
here's your chance.
if we do this, we're gonna have to grieve.
you'll have to grieve anyway. There's nothing you can do about that.
at least this way you'll know that...
you did the one thing you could.
we're not doing the procedure, are we?
Oh, baby.
no. We're not doing this. - Just give me one minute.
one minute, and then you never have to see me Or hear from me again, I promise!
I didn't expect my father to die.
he was gonna live forever 'cause that's what are dads do.
and then one day he went to work and he got shot.
are you trying to make me feel better? Because you're not.
what I'm saying...
life is hard.
there's no way to predict what's gonna happen.
someone could back out of their driveway tomorrow And mow me down, and I will be dead before you.
I mean, right now is all anybody has. Right this minute.
and, yes, This diagnosis is unspeakably cruel...
and living with it will be a daily struggle,
but as long as the good days you gotta live those days.
I mean, why would you give up rocky road ice cream before you have to...
I mean, god, driving with the top down on a sunny day
I mean, that has gotta be worth living for.
it is. Right now, when you say it, it is. It is.
but when you're not here cheering me on...
how am I gonna make it through this?
well, first off, I am your friend,
and I will be here cheering you on
until you take your last breath.
but you can also...
you need to talk to someone who can help.
I work with amazing therapists. And then...
when the day comes that your life Really is not worth living anymore...
when it is worse than even rocky road can fix...
then I will kill you myself.
so this isn't crazy? - no, I think it's brave
and, you know, honest and real.
look, you didn't shy away from the tough parts of your story
because you knew it was the only way to help people Who don't have your strength, so...
make yourself vulnerable.
okay. Okay. Let's do it.
ready?
we have a child and a grandchild.
well, that's not it. Well-- or maybe it's all of it,
but we both know that it's more than just nostalgia.
Yeah, but, sam, we can't keep Just returning to the well that is us
when things go bad. It's... It's gotta change.
fife? He's the, uh, the change you're looking for?
because he basically just challenged me to a duel.
Yeah. Apparently, he's under the impression That I'm the only thing that's keeping you two apart,
which makes me think you're not being totally honest about us.
but there is no us, sam. Despite what happened, there's...
anything you guys want to tell me?
not everything's about you, addison.
did something happen between you two?
you know what? Your boyfriend was my husband for 17 years.
he married me, I had his child, So unless you ever hit those milestones,
my relationship with sam will always trump yours.
what's going on with you, naomi?
you know, here's what's going on
Maya and olivia, they are my life.
that's why I came back here, But...
here isn't good for me.
here is just fraught with manipulation and cheating and...
Sam, you basically offered to kill a man for charlotte,
and--and pete lied about a patient's blindness,
and, god, a pregnant junkie came to st. Ambrose,
and instead of helping her, we bought her baby.
I mean, what... That's not us, is it?
I mean, I'm not perfect. I'm not saying that I'm perfect. I'm not.
but since when do we do things like that?
just coming back here, I'm just not sure anymore...
how far is too far for everyone?
I'm sorry. I just...
nothing feels right here anymore.
I wish it did, but it just doesn't.
I can't... I just can't be here.
come with me, then.
I was over you.
over you, back at the n. I.H. Doing the kind of work I love,
and they were happy to have me back,
excited about the cutting-edge research I was doing for them.
they threw money at me-- research grants, post-docs,
unlimited lab resources. It was a dream job, and I had it all.
I had everything. Almost everything.
I quit my job. I walked out on them.
sold my place and everything I own, And I came out here to be with you.
you're my past, gabriel.
you're all my past.
I'm fine. - Cooper.
I said I'm fine.
I think what I think, coop.
but I never want to hurt you.
I know you told everybody not to mention the tears,
but really, I mean, it freaks me out.
well, now I'm...
I actually am crying because...
my mother killed herself.
well, that... Does not freak me out.
there were so many times...
that I had wished she'd just...
disappear.
and now I would give anything...
for one more conversation,
just one more chance to talk to her.
what would you say to her?
there's nothing trashy about twirling the baton.
what? - When I was 10.
the uniforms were cute and the batons were sparkly,
and what the hell did it matter anyway? But bizzy said no.
actually, she said,"over my dead body."
so... Should I get you a baton?
I'm not a morning person.
I beg to differ.
I shouldn't be this happy.
Why?
well, what you wrote about violet...
was accurate and right now, beside the point.
to do than talk about her, but if you can't...
Oh, no, no, no. Let's-let's start over.
good morning.
it's about to be.
Hey, you on call today?
Yeah. I got paged on an incoming arrhythmia.
how's addison doing?
well, she's fine, I guess.
in seattle, delivering a baby.
is everything okay?
she, uh, she wants her own baby.
and I'm not ready, but, uh...
76-year-old female, acute shortness of...
Adam, what are you doing here?
she's gotten worse. Didn't know what else to do.
bradycardic at 40 with a pressure of 90.
please, Pete. Respiratory rate?
24 and labored. Put her in bay one. Is that My mother.
well, under the circumstances, your anger is justifiable.
under the circumstances, homicide is justifiable.
Oh, if I have to hear "she's my b. f.f." one more time...
wait. I'm sorry. Do...
have you ever done one of those city college lecture things?
because you look really familiar. - No. No, that wasn't me.
so let's-let's, uh, let's stay on point here.
I... I think the important thing is to understand why your daughters made this decision and to figure out how we can move forward.
I've racked my brain, and I just don't know.
Lisa and I have always been so close. What did I do wrong?
well, this isn't necessarily about you.
I'm a single mother with three kids, Dr. Wallace.
when something goes wrong, it's always about me.
maybe the girls were trying to redefine their lives in a way that is more meaningful to them.
maybe compensating for low self-esteem or looking for what they perceive as unconditional love.
Oh, give me a break. What does Casey have to be upset about?
and that's what we need to explore.
which is also why we need to speak to your daughters.
we're not pathetic, knocked-up teenagers.
we made a choice. It's a pact.
explain that to us.
why did you decide to get pregnant... Together?
why should I worry about good grades and getting into college when all I want is to be a mom anyway?
Plus, instant status.
babies love you no matter what. That's awesome.
are you not feeling loved at home now, Lisa? - Well, yeah.
my mom's a trooper. It's just...
there's a lot going on around the house, so she can't give each one of us attention, you know?
I felt loved until my mother tried to make me have an abortion.
what you might think is a lack of love could be your mother trying to protect you.
she's trying to protect herself. She doesn't care about me.
that's why we need each other.
she has a. v. Dissociation.
Pete, is she... Atropine.
I can't breathe.
she's in third-degree heart block. What does that mean?
I need to float a temporary pacemaker, stabilize her rhythm.
what the hell is going on?
if you want to stay, you're gonna have to stop talking. I can handle this.
Where's the damn catheter? All right, heart rate's dropping.
Pete, please, look at me. Do something.
get out! If you want her to live, get the hell out!
so the Belarus competition,
I won... First American ever.
what? That's amazing. What did you play? - Rachmaninoff's third.
Really? That's like the hardest concerto there is.
not like, it is the hardest.
the technical aspects are impossible for most musicians to master.
child or adult. You must be very proud of your grandson.
no one plays it as well as patrick.
every bit of his hard work and discipline shows.
is the numbness constant or does it come and go?
it comes and goes.
grab my fingers and squeeze...
hard as you can.
okay. Now hands out, palms up.
close your eyes.
is something wrong? - Well, I think it would be worth getting an m. r.i. and our neurosurgeon should take a look.
do you know how many conversations we've had about protection?
I bought her condoms.
I put her on birth control pills.
I suppose I should've just taped her damn legs shut, but I didn't... Like that would've worked.
o - Okay, okay, let's calm down. Easy for you to say.
you're not the one who's going to be contending with three kids and a grandchild.
we're the ones who will sacrifice.
Jamie, what are you thinking?
she's probably glad her mom's not here to yell at her.
my mom said she had to pick up my brother and drop him off at home.
she said she'd be back. - Can I just say something?
we've been here all morning. If we're here all afternoon, we're gonna miss a lot more than school.
I don't care if we're here all day every day for the rest of the year.
we have to sort this out.
you wrote this book.
I knew I recognized you.
I bought this last week and I'm halfway through it, but... She's not the right therapist for our daughters.
you guys, she has this totally nasty scar down her stomach.
can we try to focus? - Ah, no laying out for you, eh?
there are things in this book that I promise you - you will not like. - Like what?
I don't want to embarrass her, but...
this is not the place for this discussion.
could we see the scar? - Jamie, let's go. We're done with this.
Patrick's parents died in a car accident when he was 5, and dennis has raised him on his own ever since.
he was apparently a renowned conductor until his son died.
then he took patrick in, taught him the piano, and now this kid's a prodigy.
Mm. Classical music puts me to sleep.
are you really that uncultured?
this coming from the guy who rushes home to watch outtakes of "American bake-off"?
okay.
damn it.
what? What is it?
it's called a pilocytic astrocytoma.
it's in the part of the brain that controls hand function.
am I gonna die? - You'll have to have surgery.
you'll have to cut into his brain?
it's the best course of action.
the safest and simplest route would be right through the center of the motor strip.
but if we go through that area, the likelihood is that we would destroy all function in his right hand.
I... I won't be able to play music anymore?
no.
are there any other options?
I can do an awake craniotomy.
awake? During brain surgery?
because you'd be conscious and able to talk to me,
I could monitor your hand function much more closely and try to avoid damaging any of the corresponding nerves.
would it hurt? - There are no pain sensors on the brain.
your scalp would be numb, so you would hear the drill, you would feel pressure from the vibration, but it wouldn't hurt, however, because I would be taking a longer and more indirect route, - there is a possibility of inflicting more damage. - What kind of damage?
Patrick might end up with some degree of paralysis in his right leg.
but... But I'll still be able to play.
uh, I don't know if this is the right...
please, grandpa. Let her do it.
I don't need legs, but I need the piano.
what do you think? The pacemaker will buy us time.
I can't figure out why her rhythms deteriorated. - How is she?
uh, she's stable for now. - What is she doing out of jail?
well, after you wouldn't sign her compassionate release, mom's health got worse.
she developed congestive heart failure.
and the prison doctors, they couldn't handle it, so... Last week, they, uh, they let her out.
anyway, this morning, she, uh, she was having a hard time catching her breath, so I called 9-1-1.
all right, did anything bring this on? Has she been smoking?
just a few a day.
how about drugs? Anything new?
answer the question.
look, I tried finding another doctor to sign that release.
but you were right, Pete.
her heart symptoms, they weren't bad enough.
she just wasn't sick enough. - So she told you to make her sick enough.
she said she didn't care how, that she'd do anything.
so I did some research, and I, uh...
I bribed a guard who, uh, slipped her these pills.
all right, what... What kind of pills?
what were you thinking? - She begged me. I had to get her out.
what kind of pills? - Digoxin.
what is it? What's the matter? - Don't you understand? You poisoned her.
I need 250 milligrams of digiverse. Now.
violet, I think it might be better if you step aside on this one.
Sheldon, some people who read my book will be patients.
I anticipated that. I can work with that.
it doesn't take away from the fact that I can help these girls.
I think it does.
as therapists, we have to be blank slates, sounding boards.
there's a reason we're judicious about sharing our personal lives with patients.
it distracts them.
they waste time focusing on us instead of dedicating their energy on their own problems.
you know that that session was tainted.
there was no taint there.
there-there was titillation, and that will fade.
those girls don't want to be here, which means getting through to them is an uphill battle.
and their mothers... I just...
there's a lot of work that needs to be done in repairing those relationships.
which I can do, because last time I checked, only one of us is actually a mother or a former 16-year-old girl.
with all due respect, having a vagina does not give you a degree in psychiatry, and whether you might believe it or not, your book is a problem.
I can handle it, sheldon.
you know, you might find this hard to believe, - but I was trying to help her. - She almost died.
I told him to do it.
I had no choice because you wouldn't help me.
you are not my responsibility.
Yes, she is. Parents take care of their children, then children step up for their parents.
I mean, isn't that what you're gonna do teach lucas?
you leave my son out of this.
boys, please. She did not take care of us.
I was the one who made sure we had something to eat every day.
I was the one who put us to bed on the nights when she was drinking, which was every night.
don't talk about me that way. I'm still your mother.
Yeah, you were there at the birth, I'll give you that, but that's it.
how did you get to be so cold, Pete? You made me that way.
you look like the cat who got the cream.
I am most definitely that cat.
who's the lucky girl?
the reviewer who trashed violet's book? You're kidding.
how'd that happen?
Oh, I met her at violet's book party, and then she called.
I knew I should've said no after what she did to violet...
only matters what she's doing to you, and from the looks of it, she is doing it well. I say go for it.
go for what? Marla Thompkins.
Seriously? - Was I speaking in tongues?
you'd really do that to violet? - Yes, I'm late for something.
who put a bug up your ass?
that'd be me.
I gave his patient an opinion he didn't like.
my patient is a piano virtuoso. He also has a brain tumor.
the safest way to remove the tumor may mean that he never plays the piano again.
if I take a more radical approach,
I'll compromise his leg but I'll spare his hand.
he could have a stroke.
you could knock out his hearing or his vision.
this is the surgery that patrick wants.
he's 14 years old. He's nowhere near old enough to understand the implications of a decision this big.
what's the right age to choose between an arm and a leg?
look, some things you just know.
I knew at age 6 I was gonna be a surgeon.
and when I was a little kid, I was obsessed with the piano - and thought maybe I wanted to be a musician. - I never knew you played.
bcause my interests changed.
what was important to me then is not important to me now.
and maybe someday, patrick's gonna want to walk down the aisle or chase after his kids.
look, this kid has a gift.
who are we to take it away from him?
believe it or not, my day got worse.
Yes, actually, I'm meeting someone ...
so Pete is all freaked out because they brought his mother into the e. r. and she's supposed to be in prison, but his brother...
his brother, adam-got her out. But not in any normal way.
no, no, not through a parole hearing or time off for good behavior. No, he poisons her.
he poisons her.
now granted that is a course of action I've been considering with my own mother for a number of years now, but I've managed to keep that particular genie in the bottle.
so Frances' heart is now damaged, - and adam is blaming Pete, and Pete is blaming adam ... - sorry I'm late.
Oh. We didn't the chance to meet the other night at your party.
Marla thompkins.
Yeah, I- I-I know who you are.
are you two dating?
well, you know... Labels can be so confining.
we're dating.
Patrick and I have discussed it. We will go with the safer surgery.
well, that's a good call.
we didn't discuss it. Grandpa just told me what he wanted.
what? It's the truth.
you are a child.
it's my brain.
Patrick, we can't go ahead with a craniotomy without your grandfather's consent.
but if Patrick does not want the other surgery, we can't force him to do that, either. I don't understand.
if it becomes a matter for the courts, they'll probably go with what you decide, but that could take weeks.
we don't have weeks. We need to do the surgery immediately.
or Patrick will die. We'll do the safer surgery.
but that's not what I want.
the decision's been made. No, it's not.
either you let me do the awake craniotomy, or you let me die.
Hey, Patrick.
you never get nervous when you're onstage?
once I start playing, I'm just in it.
I guess that's a good thing when you're performing.
but, you know, that focus on what's right in front of you, it can keep you from seeing everything else.
this surgery that you want, you could spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair.
I don't care. - You don't care now, but I don't think you really understand the decision you're making.
there's only a handful of people in the world who can do what I do.
when I play, every part of me
my hands, my brain, my soul
it all engages in this perfect synchronicity.
it's almost like I'm watching myself rather than actually doing it.
I can't really describe it, but...
being a musician, that feeling,
I know it's the most important thing to you now, but you're just a kid.
you can't close yourself off to the idea that other things could become equally if not more important.
I think if you talk to your grandfather about this...
he loves you, Patrick.
he loves the way I play.
I don't think music is as important to him as your relationship.
music is my relationship with my grandfather.
all these people showed up at the house the night my parents were killed.
I didn't know what they were doing there, but everyone kept asking me if I wanted ice cream or pizza or a movie.
I thought it was a party.
then I saw my grandfather, and he looked so sad.
I tried to hug him, and he didn't know what to do.
he never really looked at me after that until he taught me to play piano.
that's how we started to speak to each other.
you can learn other ways to communicate.
he can't.
I'm-I'm Violet Turner. I'm Pete's wife.
who'd have thought Pete's a doctor married to a doctor?
and a pretty one, too.
and your boy lucas, is he as smart as the two of you?
smarter. He has Pete's smile.
well, I never saw much of that smile.
Pete never talks about his father.
well, that's because he never knew him. - You two weren't together that long?
long enough to have a baby...
a few laughs.
well... Do you need anything?
can I get you anything?
can you get Pete to talk to me?
well, I think that's up to Pete.
I'm probably asking for too much.
I mean, he's been here.
he's just cold.
I can't erase what I did.
I'll be judged for that.
but I want Pete to forgive me.
I need that before I...
you don't owe me one damn thing.
but please, can you help me?
why didn't you tell me you played piano?
it didn't seem important.
sounds like you used to love it. - I used to love to eat paste, too.
why'd you give it up? - The piano or the paste?
did you get bored? - no.
were you just not any good? Actually, I was quite good.
my dad taught me. You know, my mom, she's not at all musical.
the woman can't even whistle. So it was something special that me and my dad shared, just the two of us.
then why'd you quit?
I told you about my brother.
the one who died before you were born-Andy.
so when I was, like, 15,
I found a picture tucked into some sheet music, um, of Andy.
and he couldn't have been more than 4 or 5, and he was sitting on my dad's lap, and my dad was holding his hands on the keys.
and so your dad taught Andy to play, too.
doesn't mean it wasn't special.
every time I practiced, I wondered if my dad was in the other room pretending it was Andy playing...
so I quit.
sorry, Coop.
don't be. It was a long time ago.
you wanted to know, and I told you.
you know, um...
every sunday when I was growing up, my parents would take me to this chinese restaurant, and, um... I-I hated it.
it was all the way across town, and we would drive in silence to get to this meal where nobody basically said a word.
so, um, the last time I was home, my parents wanted to go to that restaurant, and I thought, you know, I'm a grown-up.
I mean, how bad can it be?
well, two bites into this egg roll,
I was complaining about work, and my mother cut me off with a smile, and she said, "why didn't you become a lawyer like your cousin Trudy?"
and the way she said it,
Pete, I swear, I...
I couldn't even finish eating. I just walked out the door.
I thought trudy was a teacher. She is.
she practiced law for two years, and then she quit, which is a fact my mother is well-aware of.
okay, I get it Violet.
nobody pushes our buttons like family. And when they do, it evaporates every ounce of maturity we have, and we are left to be stubborn, angry 12 year olds.
are you telling me to grow up? No.
I'm... Saying that you could heal your 12 year old by forgiving Frances for all the terrible things that she did.
she knows she failed you. - She doesn't know anything of the kind.
I talked to her, Pete.
why would you do that?
because you're my husband.
because knowing even just a little bit about her and your past helps me to understand you better.
I know that this is hard. - if you want to make peace with some parents, why don't you start with your own?
I've never seen you make so much as a phone call.
Yes, yes, I-it's true. I am asking you to do some work that
I have not yet been able to do on my own, but just because that seems unfair doesn't mean that I am wrong.
if you are able to forgive Frances, she won't be able to control you anymore.
she is who she is, you are who you are, and the only thing that's important is how you move forward.
but that's up to you.
I talked to Patrick. - And?
he wants the awake craniotomy because he thinks his grandfather won't love him anymore if he can't play the piano.
the grandfather told him to get the safer surgery.
a smart kid can always feel the truth behind the words, and now he is making a life-or-death decision based on fear that...
lots of people do.
this is just wrong.
Cooper.Dennis has raised this kid by himself - for, what, like ten years? - Yeah, I know, but...
their relationship can't be that tenuous.
look, I know seeing me with Marla was a shock, and I know you two got off on the wrong foot, but if you give her a chance, I think you'll see - that she's really kind of an amazing person, you - she's a bitch.
okay, look, she didn't like your book. - She savaged me, Sheldon.
does the entire world need to be in love with you?
are you really that insecure?
you know, sheldon, my plate is kind of full right now with Pete and his mother and teenagers ruining their lives.
I don't have time for this crap. Hello.
sorry we're late.
okay, well, um, this is the nursery, obviously.
so after your babies are born, they'll be brought here to get cleaned up and get some tests done.
unless they're, you know, cut out of you.
we've all read it. And after about an hour, they'll be brought to your room so that you can nurse.
did it hurt when the crazy lady cut it out of you?
okay, again, this is not about Dr. Turner.
this is about you and how your lives are gonna change.
okay, that is not fair.
she's telling us we're total screwups, but in reality... - no one is saying that.
hello. Were you completely tuned out yesterday?
she smushed with, like, two guys and didn't even use protection.
she doesn't even know who the dad is. - She is right here.
whatever. You didn't even want your kid.
at least we want our babies.
Oh, getting pregnant for status or to get love, that is selfish and immature.
violet, that's enough. - No, no, Sheldon.
I want to help these girls, but I'm not gonna stand here and be abused.
okay, please, just leave.
Oh! Ohh! Ah! Ah! What's going on?
it feels like something's tearing inside me. Aah!
we need a gurney here! Lisa, call Casey's mom.
no, no, I don't need her. Just lisa.
Ah! What's happening? Okay, okay, you are bleeding inside, your baby is in danger, and it needs to come out right now. Ah! Ah!
Oh, my god. That's disgusting.
the delivery isn't the hard part.
the pain is fleeting.
it's the responsibility that's forever.
this isn't what I expected. I mean, just look at Casey.
this is too much. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.
I'm here for you, and we'll - We'll keep working.
no. I can't do this.
is that Lucas?
I used to think it was my fault.
if I was a better kid, that you wouldn't drink.
if I was a good son, that maybe one of the guys you brought home would hang around for more than a couple of days.
but... But then I had Lucas, and...
the love I feel for him, it just...
changed everything.
how could you not feel that for Adam and me?
I - I was drunk most of the time.
then there were drugs.
you know, after a while, the person you are... Is just gone.
Pete, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what to do to make it up to you.
maybe I can't.
but I love you.
is it too late to start over?
Lucas, this is Frances.
she's your grandmother.
Hi. You are a big boy.
he looks like you.
hello.
Yeah.
Pete, got a second?
so I looked at the echo, and the damage to her heart is pretty extensive.
there's nothing we can do, Pete. I'm sorry.
mama?
how long?
well, she's in borderline cardiogenic shock.
she's not responding - Sam, how long?
not long.
you wanted to see me?
I'd like to talk to you about Patrick.
I assumed.
he needs to have surgery.
either surgery, but he needs to have one.
so you two need to make a decision, because his tumor is gonna keep growing and...
do you love him?
you have to love him.
just because I don't say it doesn't mean I don't feel it - or that Patrick doesn't know it. - He doesn't know it.
I mean, can't you see that? He is terrified that his only connection to you is through music.
himself because he is afraid that without piano, you won't connect anymore.
you have to tell him that you love him.
you have to say the words, because if you don't and we are not able to do something, he is gonna die.
don't you dare lecture me about death.
someday you will reach a point where more of the people you love are dead than alive, and that, Dr. Shepherd, is terrifying.
to lose your wife... To a stroke and then your son in a car accident I understand death.
what I don't understand is why every feeling has to be communicated.
if the love is there, you know.
when I was a kid, my dad was shot in front of me, and what helped me keep going was my mother.
every night before bed, she said,"good night. I love you.
I will see you tomorrow," and there was no confusion.
there was no doubt that she loved me enough for both of them.
and that even in his absence, she would be there, always.
please just talk to him.
if Patrick wants the surgery, do it.
I thought... Why aren't you dressed?
I'm not going in today.
you gonna see your mother?
maybe. I don't know.
you don't want to do this.
spare me the missed opportunity speech.
that ship sailed a long time ago.
W - what, so you're gonna walk away now?
look, I didn't get the mother I wanted.
I didn't get the mother I deserved, and it made me so angry... I wanted her to die.
I wished for it.
but yesterday, for a few minutes, it was like...
her death would've been easier before, but now it's...
now it's gonna hurt because you had a glimpse of what could've been between the two of you if things were different.
I'm sorry, Pete. It's gonna hurt.
I mean, there's just no way around it.
you just gotta get through it.
but maybe this pain is good...
because it means that somewhere inside of you you still want to connect with Frances, and now she wants that, too.
I mean, has it come decades too late?
yeah... But...
but maybe those patients that you comforted while they died, maybe they were just practice for helping your mother...
right here, right now.
you think he's coming? - I don't know, Cooper.
but he might.
Hey. You ready?
my grandfather's not gonna show, Dr. Freedman.
I told you, he's only interested in me if I can play.
you know what? Why don't I gown up?
you don't have to go in there alone. I won't be.
I've got Dr. Shepherd. Okay.
I'm sorry I was so harsh on you at the hospital, but the book, it changes things, you know? It just does.
I didn't need you to bail me out back there. - Yes, you did.
look... I don't want this to be adversarial betw...
you should've thought of that before you starting smushing that venomous...
don't make this about Marla.
you know what? Let's keep this professional.
fine. My professional opinion is that you're not in a position to help those girls right now.
but I am the same therapist as I've always been.
I'm probably better, in fact, but...
what am I supposed to do?
you had something to say and you said it.
it's healthy for you. It's gonna help a lot of people.
but there's a price to be paid for that, and that's where you are right now.
and I'm sorry, but that's just the reality.
I need to stimulate a few more areas in your brain so I know where it's safe to cut.
just keep playing, okay, Patrick?
any requests?
I think the guy with his brain exposed gets to choose.
Wh-what's happening?
it's okay. Now I know that's an area I can't go near.
all right, Patrick. I'm gonna cut now. You ready?
Patrick, you all right?
I wish Dr. Freedman had been right.
I wish my grandfather would've come.
let's get started.
where is he? Where's Patrick?
uh, he's already in surgery.
I never should've agreed to this surgery.
I thought if I gave him what he wanted, he-he'd know how I felt.
if anything happens, and I missed my chance...
maybe it's not too late.
I love you.
what's happening? - Dr. Shepherd, I can't feel my hand.
Dr. Shepherd? I've got some bleeding in the brain.
well, do something! I can't lose him.
I need some suction here.
I did this.
stop.
no, no. It's because of what I gave her.
I mean, I was just trying - She's been sick for a while.
and now it's time.
don't be scared. I'm here.
we're both here.
thank you.
it's okay, mom.
you're gonna be okay.
no, no, no.
why did we have to leave?
Dr. Shepherd needed to focus.
I was too late. I was too late.
whatever happens, Patrick knows you love him.
he's in recovery. He had a brain hemorrhage.
I had to evacuate the hematoma, but I managed to get the bleeding under control and I got the whole tumor.
Whew. Thank you. Thank you so much.
uh, will he walk again?
we won't know until the swelling goes down.
if we're lucky, he may end up with only some mild weakness in his leg, but he will play again, so all things considered, this was a success.
uh, can I see him? - Of course.
how can you say it's a success if he might end up paralyzed?
that's the success.
how are you doing?
Lisa never came back.
jamie called.
she's giving her baby up for adoption.
so much for the pact.
and has your mom been by?
to criticize me and yell.
she's not gonna come around on this.
how am I supposed to do this by myself?
I'm totally alone.
did you decide on a name?
well, then you're not alone. You've got Ben.
I'm scared.
well, we can work on that.
I read your book, all of it.
And?
I can't believe how much you've been through.
it must have been really hard.
um, yeah. Well, you know, it was.
but, um...
you know, I got through it.
when I saw Casey...
that little person just kind of came out of her, and it just suddenly became real.
like...
I feel like I've really screwed up.
I look at my mom, and she tries to be nice, but she already has three kids.
she doesn't need another one.
well, this won't be her child. It'll be yours.
I know.
but I... But I need her.
I really need my mom.
and watching Casey, I just...
knew that I'm gonna need help, and I don't want to be any more of a burden.
my mom doesn't deserve that.
well, look...
family is... Hard.
it just is.
but your mother will understand, because she already knows what I've been trying to tell you.
that from this moment on, your primary focus has to be the well-being of your child.
that's...
that's why I left my son with his father, because I couldn't take care of him, and...
and he deserved better.
just like you said in the book.
just like I said in the book.
I don't know if I want to keep this baby anymore.
maybe I do. I'm just not sure.
but I don't know how to talk to my mom about this.
well, why don't we talk to her together?
here's the thing - I don't know your father, and maybe when you were a newborn, he did look at you and wish that you were Andy, 'because frankly, babies all look the same.
they're all bald, wailing poop machines.
but the minute you started to grow, you were Cooper, not some replacement child.
what did you do?
you can't give up on the things you love, not ever.
go.
all I'm saying is that Violet's got a lot going on.
she opened herself up for this book, and you wrote a - a tough review.
the book is already causing problems with patients.
and-and then she sees you with me...
so what? My interaction with Violet's professional.
my interaction with you is personal.
I don't see the conflict.
unless your relationship with Violet is personal.
well, we're colleagues.
look...
I like you, Sheldon, a lot.
but I don't want to have to fight for your loyalty or affection.
I'm not asking you to fight for me.
no, but apparently, I have to ask you to fight, and I don't like that feeling.
when being with me is more important to you than what Violet thinks about us, call me.
Oh, come on. - No.
she died.
I'm so sorry.
Adam took it pretty hard.
well... You know, he's...
had a lot more years of actually speaking to her than I have, so...
you-you can leave all this, sweetie.
the funeral home came and took the body away.
Pete - I don't even know if she wants to be buried or cremated.
maybe adam knows, but I... - Pete.
Cooper, get out.
Oh, you look incredible.
you're not supposed to see me yet.
I think...
I - I think it's a mistake for us to do this.
48 hours earlier
Hey. You okay? What's going on?
are you worried about something?
are you getting pre-wedding jitters?
you gonna jilt Cooper at the altar?
because I will drive the getaway vehicle, - no questions asked. - I am not jilting, Cooper.
it's just, weddings mean family, and our families...
look, my mama is a straight-up southern belle, which means she's charming, judgmental, and not afraid to self-medicate.
imagining her with the freedmans...
and if they're anything like their son, they'll want to hug her and kiss her and whine about how there aren't any good delis in los angeles.
sometimes when you have those "worlds collide" situations, they actually turn out okay.
and sometimes they end with a giant fireball that consumes everything around 'em.
well, how much time do they have to spend together before the wedding?
Cooper and I thought we could limit it to a dinner.
is there anything I can do to help? - Plan the dinner.
Oh. Okay. Uh, I was really just asking to be polite, but you really want me to do it?
I just figured, if you're gonna be my maid of honor...
wait. What? Really? Me?
we're junkies together. That makes us b. f.f. s in my book.
and Cooper has Violet as his best man.
he keeps saying I need someone to stand up with me, so I would very much like you to be my maid of honor.
just don't forget to bring your fire extinguisher.
can I help you? - I'm Dr. Violet Turner.
I was told you were the medical investigator on my case.
did we have an appointment for today?
no. No, I just... I thought we could take a few moments to talk about Katie Kent.
Dr. Turner - I mean, this whole thing has been blown out of proportion, and I-I wanted to tell my side of the story, and you'll see
I - I think we can avoid wasting everyone's time on any kind of formal investigation.
we have a protocol, and I'm obligated to follow it.
please hear me out.
as long as you understand that whatever you tell me will in no way limit the investigation we've already opened into your case and can also be used as the basis for further inquiries.
ready when you are.
Hey.
I didn't know you were back.
uh, how was Africa?
it was good. It was really good. - Yeah? You look amazing.
I'm-I'm-I'm late for a meeting.- Hi.
Hey. Welcome back, Na - yeah.
omi. - She hates me.
well, she's not too crazy about me, either.
so, uh...
are we still agreed?
you don't have to keep asking me that.
well, I just don't want things to be awkward for Charlotte and Cooper.
it's not gonna be, all right?
we're not gonna tell anybody we're broken up.
we're gonna go to the wedding together, and then afterwards, - we're gonna tell everybody that - we're still friends. Okay.
you're gonna get a call from the medical board investigating Violet.
I can't believe it's this serious. - Well, believe.
they're gonna interview you. - Me?
you and I are the only other doctors who treated Katie, and I just got my call, so...
you really think there's a chance she could lose her license? - Yes.
but if we can help explain what happened...
just be very careful when you answer their questions.
I know you're not asking me to lie. - I'm asking you to protect Violet.
I don't need to be protected.
all the therapy I did with katie, the-the attack, the trial, the book-I have nothing to hide, and neither do you.
miss me?
Gabriel, what are you - I heard your speech, but I am confident that eventually, you will see the error of your ways, and when you do, I'll be here, waiting.
where are you going? - I have a patient in assisted living.
I'm making a house call.
there are laws against stalking.
Oh, prison doesn't scare me.
Hi. Did I forget to tell you that I was coming?
Oh, I'm sure you didn't.
uh, this is Dr. Fife. He's a colleague of mine.
why don't we give Marion a - a minute?
I've never seen her in anything other than a dress with her hair and nails done, which means she's being polite.
wouldn't have mattered.
is this you? - Yes, and my husband Jerome.
how long were you married?
Jerome died just before our 51st anniversary.
well, bet you can still fit in that dress.
Marion, your glucose is really high.
have you been taking your insulin?
Oh, careful.
is there something wrong?
you're not yourself today, Marion. Did something happen?
if you want to talk, dr. Fife can leave and - Oh, it doesn't matter.
you know, marion, there is a therapist here on staff.
and I have two in my office.
you want me to talk to so-some stranger half my age, tell 'em I'm sad, and then listen to him try to put things in a perspective he doesn't have?
I- I-it's just, that if you're really sad, then
we can zap the sadness out.
there's a procedure called an anterior cingulotomy.
the neurosurgeon uses a gamma knife to destroy the parts of the brain that cause depression.
listen, thank you both for coming here.
I'll try to remember the insulin.
but I don't need shrinks and I don't need knives.
I just need to be left alone.
Hey, Cooper, uh, this is, this is my lawyer,
you went to speak with Neal Chaplin without me present?
what were you thinking? - I was thinking that if Katie has dropped the lawsuit, - there's no reason for the medical board to pursue it. - But they are pursuing it.
and now that they've opened an investigation, it doesn't matter what she does.
well, I... I- I-I didn't say anything.
as soon as he brought out the recorder, I left.
I'm gonna catch up to you later, okay?
look, I-I was just thinking that if I could...
I talked to Pete about it - Pete is now a witness in this investigation.
Are-are you saying I need to be cautious around my own husband?
you need to be cautious around everyone.
it's your license that's on the line.
the woman is probably just depressed, and Fife suggests destroying part of her brain.
well, if you invited him, you should've known.
I did not invite him. - It's part of my strategy.
I did an anterior cingulotomy back at Hopkins.
pre-op, the man would not even get out of bed.
post-op, he was cooking dinner for the entire neighborhood.
we gave him his life back. - So there.
but any surgery on someone marion's age is gonna be rife with potential complications, - including a stroke - well, you have to be brave enough to take that risk.
actually, you're asking the patient to take that risk, which I'm not sure makes you brave at all.
more importantly, Marion has already made it clear - that she does not want this surgery. - That's the depression talking.
it's clouding her judgment and making her incapable of an informed decision.
depression doesn't necessarily make someone incompetent.
unless it does, which makes this kind of a catch-22.
I mean, we can't treat her depression if her depression is preventing her from seeking treatment.
Marion shouldn't be included in this. - What?
the disease determines the cure, not the patient. - Listening to your patient, working with them, that's essential to good doctoring.
healing is essential to good doctoring.
Amelia uses the gamma knife, Marion will feel better.
it's a win-win. - No one is doing any kind of cutting until we determine just how bad off marion is.
will you please talk to her? - Sure.
what a lovely place to work.- And, uh, saving the best for last
this is the office of Dr. Charlotte King.
violet, you are funny as ever.
mom, what are you doing here?
Hi.
you told us to wait, but you know your mother.
we were too excited, so we came on over.
and then we saw Violet in the elevator...
who has this amazing figure, even after having a baby. - Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I was just coming to find you. - Uh, mom, dad, this is Charlotte, and this is her mother, Augusta King.
it's a pleasure.
hello. - Hello.
nice to meet you.
well, isn't this great, everybody finally meeting?
Hey, maybe I'll just show mama around the rest of the office.
Oh, great idea. Um, - why don't you guys come with us? - Go with-Actually, you know, your mother and I are kind of hungry.
Oh, well, it's - It's lunch time right about now.
why don't you all go to the promenade and have lunch first?
that's a great idea. And you'll be joining us, right?
Oh, well, I'm-i'm really kind of busy. - Of course she's coming with us.
Charlotte, I'd love to see your office. Now.
Oh, but let's, uh... Uh, lunch?
another time.
enjoy.
well, I'm thinking deli, but, uh,
I could be persuaded to try something a little more risque.
Hey.
I keep running into Fife in the halls.
is he, uh, working here again or
no, he just-he says he won't go away until I agree to date him.
I give him a 10 for perseverance.
so what do you rate him for style?
you know what? I have a bunch of research I have to do, so...
Oh. Okay. - Okay.
Hey, Sam and I broke up. I, uh...
I just thought you should know.
Why?
well, he wouldn't commit to having a child with me and I didn't want to wait
no, I meant why-why are you telling me this?
I mean, You and I, we're not exactly...
look, Nal, there's been this wall up between you and me since Sam and I got together, and I don't want it there anymore.I want my best friend back.
that's it? You're not gonna say anything?
I hope it was worth it.
I told you, you should've ordered the brisket.
I'm sorry. It's just, um, just kind of a bad day.
but you know what? I - I think I should go.
what, so soon? - Dad, enough. Let her go.
well, the three of you need time to catch up, - and, um, yeah, I'll see you back at the office. - Fine.
is everything okay with Violet?
I swear, she didn't smile once the whole meal.
she is... Going through a rough patch right now. She'll be okay.
well, I hope so. She is such a good girl.
is there anything that we can do to help?
how about worrying a little less about Violet and asking me about my future wife?
well, we introduced ourselves, and then she and her mother were gone.
are you really surprised? I mean, you completely shut down when I introduced you.
well, the mother was pleasant enough.
but I did find charlotte to be a bit... Cold.
Charlotte is not cold. It takes a while to get to know her.
we know enough.
Oh, yeah? What's that supposed to mean?
Cooper, for the last few years, your father and I have listened to you-Every phone call, every e-mail.
and do you know how many of those were you being upset about something charlotte did?
come on. Wait a minute. That is not fair.
no, she's right, coop. We went through all of that with you
the lying to the ex-husband, sleeping with that Arthur- Archer.
Oh, it doesn't matter. The point is, she's hurt you, more than once.
and we-we understand that you're going to marry her, but-But you can understand why we can't exactly open our arms to her and pretend that nothing happened.
you're-you're my parents. I was giving you one side of the story.
there's lots of good stuff about Charlotte that I didn't tell you.
well, I'm sure that's true, but we love you, Cooper, more than anything.
so anyone who hurts you...
the chuppah will be over here.
that's just a little gazebo. - I know what a chuppah is, darling.
it's the one concession Cooper asked for. It's important for his parents.
Oh, his parents.
you know, Charlotte, the Freedmans aren't those huggy, kissy, in-your-face kind of people you warned me about.
in fact, they're a little cold. - You're right. They were cold.
and the way they fawned over that other doctor
what's her name? - Violet.
you would think she was the one marrying Cooper.
Cooper and Violet are best friends. His parents have known her for a long time.
best friends?
I suggest you do as I do and try not to let that get under your skin.
you listen, baby girl, as your mother, I have to tell you how it is, and his parents do not like you.
they barely know me. - Honey, they're not looking to know you.
mama.
no, look...
I bet they're out there right now with Cooper - telling him that you are not his kind of girl. - I highly doubt that.
I'm not saying Cooper's gonna listen.
I'm just saying, you marry a boy, you marry his family.
just consider it a warning. - I can't talk about this anymore.
I have to get to my final dress fitting.
Oh, I can't wait to see it on you.
I'm not doing anything.
look, mama, you can come to the fitting, but the dress... It's not gonna make you happy.
did something happen to it in the mail?
no, it arrived just fine, but... I'm not wearing the family dress.
for a hundred years, the women in our family have worn that dress when they took their vows.
is this because of Cooper?
has he talked you out of wearing that dress?
Cooper doesn't know anything about the dress.
now listen to me, mama.
I wore the dress when I married Billy, and look where that got me.
that can't possibly be the dress' fault.
now I know you don't want to do this, but it's what big daddy would've wanted.
and I know you don't want to let him down.
Dr. Bennett should leave well enough alone.
well, Dr. Bennett doesn't feel you are well enough.
that's why she asked me to talk to you.
she's concerned that you might be depressed.
she said she offered you several treatment options, - but you didn't seem to have any interest. - Well, that's my right, isn't it?
Yes, but our goal is to make you feel better.
and it's possible that your illness is standing in the way of your ability to discern what's best for you.
Dr. Wallace, one day you'll be old.
you'll be old and then eventually you'll be sick.
and then you'll be sad... And lonely.
and sometimes, you won't want to get out of bed or be with people.
when that happens, I hope nobody treats you like a child, because it only makes you feel worse.
you know, if you want to avoid me, you should know better than to come in here when I'm having my pre-dinner breakfast.
Oh. I'm not trying to avoid you.
I'm not.
I just, uh...
it's just, the reentry gets harder every time.
you know, I miss Maya and Olivia so much when I'm gone.
but when I'm traveling for the foundation, I just-I-I have a purpose.
you know, the work we do, it's changing lives, and I see it. I see it every day.
then I come back here to all the... Petty drama.
we're pretty well-stocked in that.- Yeah. I'm sorry.
I - I didn't mean to downplay what happened with you and Addison.
she told you.
unbelievable.
what, was I not supposed to know?
well, we, uh, we had agreed not to tell anybody until after the wedding, but still, she goes running to you.
you know, that's just... That's who she is.
it's who she's always been.
well, how do you - How do you get past that?
I don't think you can.
so you treated ms. Kent for pain?
not just pain. She had nausea associated with her pregnancy.
did you prescribe her anything?
I took a holistic approach-Acupuncture, acupressure.
were you at all concerned about how she was responding?
specifically, do you feel like ms. Kent was getting better or worse?
after she miscarried, I needed to perform an emergency d&c.
did you perform it immediately?
no, not immediately.
why not?
answer the question, please.
violet, uh...
Dr. Turner felt it was important that katie fully comprehend the loss of her baby before the procedure.
and what happened as a result of the delay?
Katie went into septic shock.
but she came through just fine.
and you believe it was medically appropriate to have waited?
Yes, Katie was
I... Um, Violet calmed her down, and then I did the d&c.
and how did Dr. Turner calm her down?
she related the experiences of her own pregnancy.
it was a way of bonding, and it worked.
and how exactly do you know what was said during Katie's therapy session with Dr. Turner?
uh, I don't know specifics, but our practice is cooperative.
doctors often discuss their cases with each other.
including matters not relevant to their specific areas of responsibility to those patients?
is that really the ethic of your practice?
well, now you're making us sound like gossips.
then let me clarify my question.
does Dr. Turner ever share the personal details of her patients with you, even when you're not treating them?
only when it's therapeutically beneficial to the patient.
can you please list the names of all other patients with whom Dr. Turner shared such personal information?
so you got nowhere? - On the contrary.
an hour in the lobby was very informative.
it's like a college dorm for septuagenarians.
everyone into everyone else's business. - Not unlike this practice.
I asked around. Marion had a good friend named Walter.
he died of a heart attack a few weeks ago. - Well, so maybe that's it.
that's why she's been giving up and not taking care of herself.
she's just grieving. - She is. But when you get to her age, loss is a much more common occurrence.
and I think the best way to deal with it is therapy.
Mm. Most elderly patients are resistant to the standard treatment of meds and talk therapy.
and frankly, at Marion's age, she doesn't have the luxury of spending five years on your couch, especially when all her pain can be eradicated with one procedure.
well, congratulations on your psychiatric degree.
Where-where'd you get that? - Oh, snark away.
pretty soon, you'll be able to get one out of a cereal box.
with the advent of psychosurgeries and new psycopharmaceuticals, - your degree is becoming obsolete. - Why are you here?
you don't even work for the practice anymore. - Oh, I'm here for her.
okay, this is not productive. - No, it isn't, but you're being myopic.
the best thing for marion is the gamma knife surgery.
well, she doesn't agree, and neither do i.
it can't be that bad.
I'm not showing it to you. - Come on. You look amazing in everything.
it's awful.
it was awful the first time around. It's awful now.
how can she expect me to wear this thing again?
why don't you just tell her no?
cause in my family, we're not rude.
what's that supposed to mean?
you described your parents as these unbelievably warm, caring people.
it was all they could do to shake my hand.
well, yeah, they were a little, uh...
they're sensitive to our history.
our history? - Come on, Charlotte.
you hurt me a few times, and I-I-I talked to them
I see you huddlin' in the bedroom on the phone, and I know who you're talking to, but I just assumed you weren't sharing the intimate details of our relationship.
you're a grown-ass man.- I'm sorry
I don't have an emotionally stunted parent to take after.
just because we don't vomit our emotions all over each other every two seconds doesn't mean we're any less feeling.
no? Well, you know what it does mean?
let's stop this. - Too late.
you know what? You should wear that dress. It looks great on you.
screw you.
I talked to the medical investigator. It didn't go well.
I mean, I answered everything as well as I could, but I don't know. Maybe - Maybe I said too much.
well, that wouldn't be a first.
what does that mean?
you told Naomi about us.
the same day we decided to keep our split a secret, you went and told her.
she had a right to know, Sam. - No, this didn't involve her.
well, she's your ex-wife and my best friend, so it did involve her
please. You just wanted to be let off the hook.
what did you think, that if you told her first, - she'd forgive you for everything that happened? - That's not fair, Sam.
no, but it's true.
Maya, Naomi, and I adjusted our lives to accommodate this relationship, and you can't see that.
you can't acknowledge the toll that took.
it took a toll on me, too, Sam.
I mean, I sacrificed my best friend for a man I was sure I was gonna raise a family with.
you think I'm being selfish? Take a look at yourself.
you've wanted me since med school, okay?
so don't flatter yourself that any pain that this has caused is all my fault.
this relationship didn't just happen. You went after it.
you're right.
but you know what, Addison?
maybe we can't be friends.
Ding, ding. Wedding update.
you will be excited to know that in between arranging what is going to be a ridiculously delicious spread for your dinner, I have also purchased an amazing dress for the wedding.
but it's not white and it's not vera wang.
I promise, everyone will be focused on you.
I'm happy for you about the dress.
then why the look?
Cooper's parents don't like me.
they just met you. - He poisoned them.
what? Why?
I don't think he meant to, but apparently, he tells them everything, including every mistake I've ever made.
they can barely look at me.
well, have you confronted them about it?
what am I gonna say, "sorry I did all these terrible things to your son, but please accept me, love me"?
well, can't Cooper convince them?
I think Cooper's done enough damage.
so what are you gonna do?
hope we make it to the altar before they convince him otherwise.
no, you can't. - Ladies, please step aside.
you're not taking our files. - We're not taking them.
we're only copying them. - What's going on?
they're trying to take our patient files. - They're relevant to our investigation.
we have consent from the patients involved to review them, so - I'll call our lawyers.
it's not gonna matter. - I can deal with this.
unfortunately, this isn't just about you anymore.
we cannot let them walk all over Violet.
well, they're already standing on her neck, and they seem hell-bent on making the rest of us lay down, too.
that's why we need to mitigate the damages.
Mitigate? - Well, maybe if violet were to take a voluntary leave of absence until the investigation is complete...
that's your idea of doing something? - Well, he's right . sorry I'm late.
Where's Violet? - We asked her not to come.
is that fair? - Right now fair is not our biggest problem.
maybe if we show them that we are cooperating
no, it's not fair, and we are cooperating. - If Violet steps back, it makes itlook like she knows that she did something wrong.
or it makes it look like she's taking it seriously.
our primary concern right now has to be protecting the practice.
I mean, they're copying our files, they're dragging us down for interviews.
this investigation is only gonna get bigger. - Let them see whatever they want to see.
we're not an organized crime family. We're doctors.
no offense, but how long have you been here, like a week?
she's not supposed to take offense to that?
look - Listen, we all talk about our patients, - not just violet. - Exactly, which is why we don't want the medical board investigating anyone else, - so we - this doesn't feel right.
one of our own is being attacked. We need to stand by her.
isn't that what this place is supposed to be about?
the only people Violet tries to help more than her patients are all of us, and if we can't...
if this is all it takes for us to turn our back on her, then I...
why did you keep a file on Pete?
well, technically, he was my patient. - For two minutes.
Yeah, it was-it was a long time ago.
we had a few sessions, then he came to work for the practice.
and you slept together? - Why is this relevant?
well, now he's my husband. We have a child.
the fact that you're married helps, but I have to be honest, the situation looks bad.
privilege really doesn't seem to be a serious matter at o. w.g.
okay, look, we are not gonna apologize for the way we practice medicine.
we know how to help people, we're good at it.
I'm sure you are, but that doesn't give you the right to sit down over coffee and discuss specific details of patients you're treating with other doctors just because it's interesting.
well, it's not gonna change.
I'm-I'm sorry, but the idea that we are suddenly gonna act like a bunch of disconnected doc-in-the-boxes who simply share space-no
I don't care who sues me or what's at stake.
we can't do that.
Oh. I prefer you not be here.
there's something i'd like to know first.
I'm, uh...
having trouble understanding why you wouldn't want to improve your quality of life.
the other doctors at the practice seem to think your depression stems from grief over the loss of your friend Walter.
Oh, and you know better?
I have that way about me, do I?
Jerome had the same brash confidence.
when you lost him-I can't imagine spending half a century with someone and then having to go on, but you did, for years.
and according to Dr. Bennett, you thrived, which leads me to believe that if you can get over Jerome, you can get over Walter, too.
I noticed the words on the game haven't changed since the last time I was here.
who was it you were playing with before you stopped? - Walter.
he was my friend. Oh, we talked...
about our spouses, about our lives.
we both loved to play scrabble, almost every day.
that sounds nice.
it was more than nice. It was wonderful.
after all those years without Jerome, to have someone I connected with...
that's okay, Marion.
but I-I couldn't.
I couldn't do that to Jerome. I just couldn't.
you couldn't do what?
we were in the middle of the game, that game, and he turned to me and smiled and he...
he told me he loved me.
well, what did you do?
I was so embarrassed.
I... I told him to get out.
a week later, he...He was dead.
but you did love him.
Oh, how could I tell him?
it was like I was cheating on jerome.
and now Walter will never know.
he'll never know I loved him.
he sat across that board from you for a lot of hours.
right?
so he knows.
whether you said it or not, I'm sure he knows.
we are going to be so late to Cooper's dinner.
um... Why aren't you dressed?
maybe Sam and Naomi are right.
maybe I am putting the practice at risk.
no, they're not right. - Well, I could I could step away.
I mean, if that's what people want, which I don't know, 'cause I wasn't invited to the meeting, but if that's what it takes no, look, your book was all about exposing yourself to help other people.
you've stood up to everything that's been thrown at you, and you've come out the other side still standing.
I don't see how tomorrow's meeting with the board is gonna be any different.
Win/lose, right/wrong, you're gonna come through this stronger.
the only mistake I can see is not standing up at all.
come on. Go get dressed. - I can't.
violet, it's a dinner for Cooper.
he's your best friend. He's getting married tomorrow.
don't make me feel any worse than I already do.
I ju
the idea of facing those people, I...
I texted Cooper, and-and-and when you see him, just tell him I love him and I'm sorry.
the one maid of honor duty Charlotte gave me, and nobody is having a good time.
Yeah, well, the meeting this afternoon didn't exactly leave people in a festive mood.
I'm telling you, if the party wasn't at my house, I wouldn't be here.
Hey.
Where's Violet?
she didn't want to come. And I don't really blame her.
look, I get, of course, you didn't want to lie for Violet, - but the way you were talking in that meeting - Pete, it wasn't personal.
Yeah, exactly. It was so cold and emotionless.
but she wrote the book, okay, and whether you want to believe it or not, now we have a really serious situation on our hands, which isn't gonna go away.
so what, you just want to abandon Violet? - No, of course not, but...
look, if that's what you want to believe
look, if everybody in this damn practice wants to be mad at me, fine.
I am still gonna do what I think is right.
first off, this does not count as stalking.
Charlotte invited me. And about the Marion thing -What was that for?
you're a good man.
you just never know.
you know, you think you hit it off with someone, that maybe they're the one - I mean, you know, the one -and then there's...
there's just so many ways to screw it up.
but you-you know what? Better sooner than later.
right? Because if it's not meant to be then you're just setting up yourself and everyone around you for a whole lot of heartache.
am I making any sense?
actually, a lot.
you guys must be so excited about tomorrow. -Very.
should be a lovely day.
look, I can spend all night trying to back in to this conversation, but the truth is, you guys are wrong about Charlotte.
I - if you got to know her, if you just gave her a chance...
she deserves that, doesn't she?
this is fun. - Exactly the way I dreamed it when I was a little girl.
all right, this is ridiculous. Let's find my parents, get your mom.
the five of us will sit down, and we'll talk this out.
Cooper - No, don't argue with me.
I mean, we have to resolve this so that tomorrow, - everyone can be happy and relaxed. - Stop talking and turn around.
my father is nodding his head. - So's my mama.
well, hey.
good to see you finally talking.
Oh, look, we're all parents here. - Yes, and we do have things in common.
mama. - Well, we don't want our kids to be unhappy.
so... We agree.
you have different religions...
and you come from different cultures...
and your personalities...
and all of these differences don't make for a happy future.
I think what the mothers are trying to say is, you two shouldn't get married tomorrow.
well, the joke is that, uh, doctors make the worst patients.
uh, but-but for me, uh, after I started to heal, it wasn't like I saw an opportunity or anything.
I just, uh, I started writing, and what came out...
it wasn't just the story of me getting through.
I realized that I was writing, uh, how I got through
what really worked, what didn't and why.
it's-it's not a road map, but, um, this book is about making the link, not just between doctor and patient, but person to person.
and it's intended to be, um, uh, proof, I guess, that if you really commit to helping yourself, no matter what you've been through, then you can come out the other side, stronger and... Healthier.
does that make any sense? - I'm going to ask you the question again.
did you consider whether, given the news coverage of your attack, ms. Kent would be easily identifiable in your book?
honestly, no.
does the issue of doctor-patient confidentiality concern you generally?
come on, Neal. - Of course it does . an investigation is one thing, but to imply a complete lack of professionalism by Dr. Turner we're concerned about a lack of professionalism at oceanside wellness generally.
and it may extend beyond Dr. Turner.
but for the time being, we're concentrating on Dr. Turner, specifically the sharing of potentially privileged information
I never intended to do anything but help people with that book. - Both of you, please.
I think we have enough information to make a decision here.
the board will be in touch.
I think...
I - I think it's a mistake for us to do this.
everyone out there, they're miserable.
our parents don't think it's gonna work, the practice is falling apart, everyone is fighting, and I don't care what anybody thinks or how they feel, not today.
I don't understand. - All that matters is you and me.
and the rest of 'em?
they don't have to agree or like it or like each other, because this is not for them or about them.
I agree, only out there, it's not just you and me.
I know how to make this feel right.
wait. So what did the text say again?
gone to vegas. Enjoy the food. Don't wait up.
so they're gonna get married without us. - Do you blame them?
I need a drink. - We're coming with you.
uh, I may bow out as well.
I'm with you. - Wait, wait. Uh , before everybody leaves, I, um...
I just want to say, I'm sorry.
I- I-you have to know that I didn't mean to make this hard on any of you.
and I just-I had no idea.
so just so you know, I-I spoke to the medical board today and, uh, answered all their questions.
um, but I didn't apologize for what I wrote, because what I wrote reflects who we are and the kind of practice that we have.
we are friends and colleagues who rely on each other to help our patients, and I am proud of us.
so they said they'd, uh, get back to me with a decision, but they didn't say when, so... There you have it.
okay.
