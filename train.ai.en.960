he did? - Yeah.
he killed it. He cried a lot.
he was nine.
we had a fire. - You did?
Yeah.
how did it happen?
it was electrical.
the garage door opener went kaput. - Oh, yeah.
Yeah. - My dad wasn't upset, but my mom was.
Yeah.
we lost so many things, I mean, baby clothes, our photo albums.
my bike.
your bike, important papers, everything, just...
we lost a lot. and I remember, I...
I went to him and I said, you know, "how can you be so calm?"
and he said, "hey, you know, those are just things, Audrey.
those are just the stuff. That's just stuff.
we still have each other.
are you okay?
this is a list.
of all the things we lost in the fire.
he's gone.
he's gone.
Jerry! Why? Why?
it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
it's gonna be okay.
Audrey?
yeah? I'm back here in Dory's room.
harper told me you wanted to see me.
Hey, come on. Sit down.
so I spoke to Kelly.
and...
she said that this, you know...
this facility, or rehab place really worked for her.
so...
now, I was kind of thinking that maybe you should go and...
Audrey, you've already done enough for me.
right. Okay, but, look, if you're gonna make this about money,
then I'm gonna be pissed.
now, if you wanna make it about something else,
I mean, I don't know, whatever, I'm gonna hate it,
but, you know, I guess I can accept that.
you know, Brian used to say something to the kids all the time.
accept the good.
accept the good, Jerry.
do they glow in the dark?
Yeah. they're fluorescent.
okay.
I'll go, but under one condition.
when I come out, I'm gonna get a job,
and I'm gonna pay you back, down to the last penny, and you will take it.
promise?
Hey, Harp.
Hi, Jerry. Wanna play?
can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah.
okay, here it is.
I'm gonna be leaving soon. I'm gonna go to a sort of hospital.
for how long? - Well, I don't know.
but when I get out, I'm gonna have my own place and you can come visit.
you mean you're not staying here anymore?
no.
why the face?
that's how it was always gonna be.
No! You can't just come here and pretend to be my dad and leave!
Harper, I never pretended to be your daddy.
Where's your sister?
she locked herself in her room. She's mad.
Why? She's mad at you? - No. You.
she's mad at me, huh?
she doesn't wanna talk to anyone.
okay, watch your hand. Scram.
Jerry!
Jerry. man.
I thought I was gonna miss you.
I'm proud of you, man. - Thank you.
I'm going back to my wife.
I'm lonely as fuck in town, man.
okay.
Howard?
thank you.
Harper?
I want to say goodbye. Can you take a look at this note?
I love you.
are you gonna be my friend when you get better?
I'm gonna be your friend forever.
like you were with my dad?
you bet.
now give me a real kiss.
good. okay.
wait! wait!
wait!
wait! Jerry!
Hi, my name is Jerry and I'm an addict.
Hi, Jerry.
I've been clean for 89 days.
my mind is clearer,
and I think it's getting better every day, a little bit.
but I wanna talk about this dream I keep having.
it always starts with me stealing silverware.
then I go sell it to this guy
who I used to know who owned a catering service.
then with the money, I go to this place where I used to buy my drug of choice,
and he's not around.
so I go to other spots, right,
but for some reason, no one is around.
all of seattle is dry,
and then I get that feeling, the dread,
and I panic.
and I start running,
and it's raining, and it gets dark.
and then I'm in my old apartment, and I'm thrashing right through it,
looking for something I might have stashed away.
and I think I'm having a seizure.
and then I find a balloon hidden in my suitcase.
so there I am with a bag of junk in one hand,
and the money for my next fix in the other,
and I feel at total, utter peace.
and I wake up.
one day at a time.
one day at a time.
one day at a time.
one day at a time.
thank you.
is it bad tonight?
bad. That's one way to describe it.
insane seems a little more appropriate.
it feels Like he's breathing down my neck.
it is my professional opinion we should get the hell out of here. Now.
noted.
clean this place up, then Locate our guests.
I just need to take the edge off.
you know the routine. I need you clear-headed.
first things first.
now, where is he?
show me where he's hiding.
son of a bitch! You said he only killed nine people.
there are 40 victims here.
nine when he was alive. He's added a few since then.
now where is he, Dennis?
all teams go to alpha. Bring in the cube!
how did this guy get the name "The Breaker"? Is he a truck driver?
simple folklore. The Local are exorcising its demons.
maybe it's because he broke his victims into as many pieces as possible.
I hate being rushed.
this one isn't Like the others.
I'll give you a bonus. -You don't have that kind of money.
after tonight you'll be surprised. Now, get to work.
careful, Dennis.
don't get too curious.
son of a bitch!
how can you justify what you're doing, Cyrus? It's out and out slavery!
you are persistent, Damon. And what about you, Kalina?
still carrying around those ridiculous quicksilver flares?
you still have that quaint magical book?
these aren't animals you're capturing, they're human beings.
they are dead human beings.
maybe you should join Greenpeace. Throw blood on old women's furs.
who are you to play God?
playing is for children. -You'll never pull it off.
not without the right spells. That, and the thirteenth ghost.
the thirteenth ghost?
get them out of my sight! We've wasted too much time already.
why did he say thirteenth?
move the cube into position.
what's he talking about, 13 ghosts?
you contracted me for 12 ghosts! The Breaker is 12!
I'm done after tonight, Cyrus.
Yes. Twelve and then one more. I thought you were psychic!
that's not how it works, and you know it!
there's no time to argue.
release the bait!
what bait? We never needed bait before!
a truck full of blood? You've got to be shitting me.
Oh, boy.
now power up the cube.
start transmitting.
come. Come. Come!
help me! Help me!
Oh, shit!
put him down!
Cyrus, I hope you're happy. You've got your twelve now.
help me! He's dying!
hang on, Damon. Somebody help! Damn you, Cyrus!
somebody help me, please!
help me. Do something!
Oh, Cyrus.
Oh, God.
swing me! -Come on, Bobby.
faster, Kathy.
let me get your arms.
try to drag me.
you're the best little brother. I love you. Let's go!
I'm going to get you! I'm going to get you!
look at those two. She's got him on the run now, but pretty soon he's going to be picking her up and throwing her over his shoulder.
they're perfect.
watch them. Watch them.
they really love this place.
I love you.
surprise!
my heart! My heart!
happy birthday, Dad!
happy birthday, Arthur.
here's my present, Dad.
we love you. Make a wish. Blow out the candles.
what did you wish for?
I love you. -I love you, too.
what's that? Why is the smoke alarm on?
I'll get the kids. Call the fire department.
dad! Help, Mom!
get the kids. Get the kids!
mom! Dad! Help me!
Where's your mom? Where is she?
I don't know where Mom is.
Bobby, we have to get out. Oh, my God!
Jean! Jean!
mom's still in the house. We can't leave her there.
Bobby, go outside. Go wait outside.
you can't go back in there, sir.
I am sorry, sir. She didn't make it.
I should have gone back in.
we are gathered here today, to honor the memory and life's work of Jean？?Kriticos...
...a devoted mother and adorable wife...
...who was too quickly taken from this life.
Jean, you will be forever missed, but never forgotten.
I miss you, Mom.
why did you have to leave us?
I can't do this without you.
I don't want you to go.
mom, I love you so much.
please watch over us.
I'll love you always.
dad, It's almost 8: 30, shake a leg or you'll miss your first class.
today on Death in America: "Cancer rates are down but suicide is sky-high...
...
we have a special treat for you today.
a body was found this morning, decolopolated.
decapitated.
Bobby, find a healthier hobby.
leave me alone, you guys, I'm recording.
good morning, everybody.
something smells interesting.
dad, they found a guy without a head behind Dunkin' Donuts.
I love Dunkin' Donuts.
Kathy.
let Maggie make breakfast for once. That's why we hired her.
dad, have you tasted Maggie's cooking?
just that one time.
I heard that. Hell, I cook better than you.
we have to try to get along here.
dad, tell Kathy that keeping a record of death is healthy.
Kathy, "Keeping a record of death is healthy.
because she's being a real slut about it.
Bobby. Don't call your sister a slut.
thank you, Maggie.
I prefer the term "bitch.
sluts are girls with loose
Mr. Edgar Allan Poe, did you do your homework?
because Mr. Peterson
damn it! Bobby, that's the third time I've tripped on that stupid scooter!
sorry. -If we had a bigger place, we wouldn't
we don't have a big place anymore, do we?
it's the best I can do for now...
...so let's all try and keep our shit off the floor.
all right? Now, Bobby, put away the damn tape recorder.
can you do that for me? And get ready for school.
I'm sorry, Dad.
must be the lawyer. I forgot.
lawyer? I thought our credit was all cleaned up.
no, I don't think it's about that.
they won't make us move again, will they?
it's gonna be all right. Whatever it is, we'll deal with it.
Mr. Kriticos?
that's right. You are?
Ben Moss. How do you do?
please, come in.
is now a good time, or...?
as good a time as any. Please, just give me one minute.
sorry. I'm ready.
I represent the estate of your uncle Cyrus Kriticos.
we have an Uncle Cyrus?
had. I only met him a couple of times as a kid.
he wasn't too popular.
my dad said he squandered the family fortune.
we have a family fortune?
no. Cyrus squandered it.
Bobby, isn't that great? You have a late uncle.
what is he late for? -His next birthday.
you mean, he's dead?
now we get his attention. -Pipe down.
Cyrus recorded this message six weeks ago.
he asked that it be played for you in the event of his death.
Arthur...
...It's good to talk to you.
sadly, if you're watching this now, it means I am no longer among the living.
happily, that makes you and your family my sole beneficiaries.
I've instructed my lawyer, Mr. Moss...
...to deliver the essential elements in my last will and testament.
give it to them, Ben.
a key?
a key to what?
a key to your new house.
what?
this house is the fruit of my life's work.
bathrooms. Everyone gets their own bathroom.
is this for real?
it is a one-of-a-kind home. It's my home, actually.
my home.
I have no complaints. I've led an interesting life.
I have seen some amazing things.
but the only regret l have, is that I never got to know my nephew Arthur...
...nor appreciate the love of a family, like you have.
this house is my attempt to make up for that.
enjoy.
perhaps we'll meet again...
...in another life.
Wow! -When can we see it?
the house is yours whenever you Like. I'm heading up there after work.
if you want, you, your wife and kids
time-out. I am not the missus here.
my wife...
my wife is...
our mom got burned to death in a fire.
what? It's true.
that's enough, Robert.
Mr. Moss, exactly where is this place?
a couple hours drive from here, a town called Willow Grove...
...just up the parkway.
it's in a gorgeous area. But l warn you, your uncle liked his privacy.
there isn't a neighbor for miles.
come on. Hurry up.
S-U-F.
suffocate. I got it. I win.
so what? You think you're so slick.
come on, you guys. We're almost there.
excited? -Yeah. Mom would have freaked over this.
looks Like things are starting to get better, right?
Yeah.
that's strange.
dad, it's beautiful.
my God. I've never seen anything Like it.
cool!
so futuroic.
it's about time somebody showed up. Is this your place?
who are you? -I'm the power guy.
don't touch.
your house is knocking out the power of the whole tri-quad area.
I need to get inside and check the breakers.
could you come back tomorrow? Is that a possibility?
tomorrow? Let me see.
there are about 5, 570 houses right now without power.
my bosses kind of frown on that, so...
well, that's not really our problem, is it?
look, buddy, I've been doing this job for about three weeks.
is there any way you can give me a break here?
sure.
no problem.
thank you.
Mr...?
Kriticos. Arthur Kriticos.
it's quite a place you've got.
Yeah. We're moving in.
one step at a time.
that's odd. -Dad, you broke it.
Bobby, give it a rest.
hello.
Wow! You can see right through it.
you guys couldn't afford any walls?
how weird.
guess Uncle Cyrus wasn't too keen on privacy.
I hope the bathroom's in the basement.
it's Like a funhouse.
it's Latin.
everything's so beautiful.
family, just so we're all clear, Miss Maggie does not do windows.
Wow!
what an incredible wealth of knowledge.
a samurai sword.
in your dreams, pal.
dad, this stuff must be worth a fortune.
Yeah, that occurred to me, too.
Oh, Cyrus.
you crazy son of a bitch, what did you do?
goodness.
it's Like a cathedral.
all right, first rule: No throwing stones.
it's marvelous, though, isn't it?
a living work of art.
the sooner you show me where you hid the basement...
...the sooner I can get my ass out of here.
I believe it's down the hall. It's two doors on the right.
excuse me.
the construction is amazing.
I'm getting dizzy.
Bobby.
don't touch anything. Okay?
at least until we get property insurance.
Arthur, we've got some papers to sign in the library.
after that, I'd love to give you and your family a tour of the house.
great. I don't want you guys to move from this spot.
we'll be right back.
you're being paranoid and overprotective.
Yeah, of all this stuff.
I know you guys too well. Stay...
...right here. I mean it.
what the...?
Where'd you hide your money, old man?
shit!
what the hell was that?
Oh, no.
Oh, Cyrus.
now I know I'm dreaming.
was Cyrus a hunter?
you could say that.
your uncle was quite a collector of many things.
I've marked where you're supposed to sign, Arthur.
okay, look.
I didn't want to bring this up in front of the kids...
...but this place is beyond amazing.
I'm just a math teacher.
the taxes alone must be...
I have nothing set aside.
to be honest, a fire took away everything.
Arthur, you don't need to worry.
Cyrus was a genius when it came to finances.
basically, you and your family never have to worry about money again.
son of a bitch.
look here. Look, you all.
look, look!
sign.
Arthur?
Arthur, we've got to...We have to talk.
what is the deal with the breakers?
nothing. I'm not a power guy. My name is Dennis Rafkin.
you're Dennis Rafkin? -Who's Dennis Rafkin?
my office warned me about this guy.
I know this will sound completely whacked, but stay with me.
I used to hunt displaced spiritual energies with your uncle.
I'm sorry?
pk agents. Revenants. Wraiths.
do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
okay. I'll do this the easy way: ghosts.
Arthur, I used to...
I used to hunt ghosts with your Uncle Cyrus.
goats?
ghosts! Ghosts, goddamn it! Listen to me!
race you to the end of the hall.
no, Bobby, I don't think this is the place
come on, slowpoke! Is that the best you got?
my grandma scoots better than that.
ghosts. As in disgruntled spirits trapped on earth. Ghosts.
as in Halloween? Boo?
as in Demi Moore and Unchained Melody. Ghosts.
ghosts. Okay, I get it. I'm scared.
don't laugh at me. Don't laugh.
I'll explain everything...
...as soon as you get you and your children outside.
what's taking you so long? -Out of my way.
I don't think scooting is your game. -Come on.
I won. -You cheated. I didn't get a start.
got to be on your toes, man.
this has to be my room. There are toys everywhere.
I wonder what my room's Like. -This is the coolest room in the house.
I'll be in here.
this place is awesome!
Cyrus has containment cubes all over the basement.
I don't know why they're here...
...and I am not staying around to find out.
so, if I were you-- -Well, he isn't you.
this guy has been harassing my office since your uncle died.
I see this all the time.
some rich guy passes away and all the nuts come out!
next thing, he'll be claiming Cyrus owned him money or
he did owe me money. He owed me a shitload of money!
these are some funky-looking specs.
what do you think? Do I look cool? -Let me see.
not so fast. Cater to my ego first:
Maggie's the best babysitter you ever had.
come on! -All right.
I'm getting my ass out of the big glass house!
grab your children! Do the same.
are you all right?
Jean! Jean!
we'll go get you some help. Okay?
don't touch me.
Oh, my God!
we have struck gold.
easy. -Don't.
how's your head?
not good.
Where's the suit?
power guy. Idiot.
cool!
better have a pair of those in my room.
Bobby, where are you going?
what are you staring at?
Hey, kiddo.
he thinks I'm going to duck.
nice tits.
what's the matter, honey? Bad representation?
not bad for an hourly wage.
it's time to leave.
I'll take your word for it.
Kathy?
come on. This way.
shit! What the hell? Kathy!
Maggie? Bobby!
I was just kidding before.
a little lawyer humor.
Kathy?
Bobby!
I don't believe it.
believe what?
I told them not to leave this spot. -They're kids, what do you expect?
thank you, Dr. Phil. You check downstairs. I'll look up.
Bobby, come on! It's time to go!
Kathy? Where are you guys?
Bobby!
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
what are you doing up here? I told you to wait downstairs.
dad, come on. This bathroom is unbelievable.
great house. Beautiful bathroom. Now, where is your brother?
he's with Maggie.
was with Maggie. We were racing and we saw all the glass
you're supposed to watch him. That's what I pay you for.
Bobby.
down here.
Maggie?
come on down and play.
is that you?
Maggie?
stop playing games.
Bobby? I have something for you. We'll have lots of fun.
don't come down, Bobby.
stay upstairs.
don't follow her.
down here, Bobby.
Bobby, don't come down.
Bobby, Around the corner.
don't come down here!
that's it.
you guys, I'm gonna tell Dad!
Bobby!
I'll find Bobby. But I want you both out of here.
but, Dad-- -No "buts"!
I want you both to wait in the car. I'll be out as soon as I find the kid.
why are you freaking out? -Just this once, don't argue with me.
what happened to the door?
son of a bitch!
I cannot believe this.
I'm going to have to break it down. Back away!
it's quite dramatic...
...but you're wasting your time. It's all sealed up.
weren't you in an orange jumpsuit? -Don't go there.
what do you mean, "all sealed up"?
what part of that code are you having trouble cracking?
the entire house is sealed up.
there must be another way out. -I've looked.
we'll look again, right after I find my son. Now get up.
I don't know what is going on here, or who the hell you are.
and my son is missing.
so, until those questions are answered, you're not leaving my sight.
now, get up!
all right. Breathe.
did the lawyer split?
Bobby.
Bobby.
come on, guys! Stop hiding!
Bobby!
Bobby. -Come on out now, pal!
stop screwing around.
glass family Robinson, you're wasting your breath.
this is ectobar glass. He won't hear you.
this is shatterproof and soundproof.
what are these?
that's a little harder to explain. They're containment spells.
ghosts can't cross those.
ghosts? -Yes, ghosts.
the supernatural realm has its own laws. For ghosts, it's spells.
written or spoken, the ghosts have to obey whatever the spells say.
the entire basement is filled with ghosts.
in this basement?
of course, in this basement. If it was next door, I wouldn't give a shit!
dad!
I can prove it. -I gave a pair of those to Bobby.
spectral viewers. You can see ghosts with these.
Bobby, come on.
I don't see any ghosts. -Because they're locked downstairs.
dad!
there's more of this crazy spell shit on the floor.
let me see those.
Bobby! Come on out, pal!
hidden barrier spells. Why would he need more protection?
all right, that's enough. This is not helping.
do me a favor and stop with all the haunted house nonsense...
...at least until we find the kid and figure a way out of here.
Bobby, come on.
I don't know where he could be.
no, no!
wait!
what did I just say, that there was a petting zoo downstairs?
No!
there are ghosts downstairs, Arthur.
right, right. But you also said...
...that they're all locked up. Right?
no. No way. -Wait.
listen.
I'll make a deal with you.
I'll pay you whatever Cyrus owed you...
...if you just help me find my son.
unbelievable. Get out of my way.
Bobby.
get out of the basement. You need to go upstairs.
you need to put on those glasses.
leave me alone!
that's it. That's a good boy.
Bobby.
Bobby.
go upstairs and find your father.
mom?
go on.
go upstairs!
go find Kathy.
watch out.
watch out.
Bobby! Come on!
you don't have to scream, all right? Just chill.
this way. -Hold on. Listen to me.
this will take forever. This place is just too big.
Kathy and I will head up this way. You two check down there.
no, I don't think we should split up. -It's okay.
go in a straight line, turn around. We'll meet back here in five.
five. Back here.
don't touch anything.
I don't want to go with him! -Go ahead.
let's go back to the ghost thingy.
there are ghosts down here. If you don't believe me, look for yourself.
I told you, I can't see any ghosts.
what the hell? Give me those. Let me see. Why are these open?
I was down here before. They weren't open.
God! I hate it when they do that! -Do what?
they wait for you to put your face up to the glass, then give you...
...a big, fat "boo"!
don't do that!
God.
see it?
it's, it's... -A ghost.
just Like I've been saying all night! Finally, a believer!
ghosts are around us all the time. Most of them can't hurt us.
most don't want to. Ghosts here, ghosts there, no one cares.
but there are exceptions, like this bad-ass behind me.
those who die violently stay in a tortured realm, so that's all they know.
what is he doing?
I don't know. I can't see. I don't have the glasses.
I've had it with this. It's time to go.
now! Please! -Don't touch me.
will you come on?
come on, ghost boy! Move your ass! It's time to go.
dad, slow down. We're going to get lost.
dad!
dad.
listen to me.
he's going to be okay.
we're going to find him.
I am so ready to leave this place.
Oh, boy. -What?
that's the symbol of The Jackal. -What's The Jackal?
the Jackal is the Charlie Manson of ghosts. If he's out, screw the kid.
we've got to get out of this basement.
maybe Rafkin was right, and maybe there
Kathy!
think about what you're saying.
there is no such thing as ghosts.
Kathy.
Kathy!
what is it? I can't see it! Tell me where it is!
get off!
hold on! Stay with me!
come on, pull!
who are you? -Never mind, just pull.
shit! Don't speak. Don't move.
somehow we got behind enemy lines.
Hurry!
please, hurry!
Hey, little guy.
how. -Don't tease the ghosts.
will you shut up? -You shut up. You keep pissing them off.
go.
Maggie! -What?
where? I can't see without the glasses, idiot!
well, I can see. And I think you should go this way!
go, go!
it's all right. I've got you.
look at me.
daddy.
it's okay.
who the hell are you?
and what the hell was that?
my name is Kallna Oretzia. I'm in the spirit reclamation business.
what?
I free trapped souls. Cyrus
forget Cyrus, who traps souls, for a damn second.
what are you doing here?
looks to me like I'm saving your ass.
Oh, my God! It's over there! It's over there!
give him your glasses.
come on!
Oh, my God.
unbelievable.
another one of Cyrus's victims.
I hope to God the barrier spells hold.
victims?
Cyrus had a nasty habit of enslaving souls.
that's why I'm here. I intend to set them all free.
listen to me.
I need to know...
...how you got in here.
I slipped through an opening in the house when it shifted.
an opening where? -It's closed now. It won't happen again.
let me show you. This is the Arcanum.
many people died in the quest for this book.
it was written in the 15th century by an astrologer named Basileus.
in it, he describes the making of a certain machine.
one that can see into the future.
he wrote it while he was under demonic possession.
I can't believe Cyrus built it.
built what? What are you talking about?
Basileus's device.
we're in the middle of a machine, designed by the devil and powered by the dead.
listen to me.
I don't give a shit about any machine...
...or devil or Basileus or anything...
...except getting my family the hell out of this place.
I came here to set the souls in this house free.
you want help, you have to help me first.
Kathy, can you walk?
Kathy! Oh, no. This can't be happening!
we have to get out of here. -I'm not going anywhere without my kids.
try telling him that.
come on.
this way. Come on.
stairs. Let's go.
go. You go!
don't touch me!
wait! The glasses!
you'll need these! Catch!
good job. -Sorry.
perfect. Another dead end.
okay, genius, we found the stairs. How do we get to them?
get away. -What? What do we do now?
get away from the glass.
Why? -Just do it.
glasses.
duck!
move! Go left!
do something, for Christ's sake! We're running out of corridors!
duck! Go Ieft! Go right! Move!
get down!
here. We've got to get to the library. It has spell protection all around it.
where is that from here?
can I rely on you not to get me killed?
I guarantee nothing.
see anything?
anything? -No.
come on.
I think they're just downstairs.
nothing.
if we get out of this alive, I've got to get a pay raise.
that's a big "if.
give me the flare.
what's wrong? Don't start freaking out now. Come on.
what?
okay. What? -Shut up.
give me the book.
just back up.
go. Slow.
okay, I'm going slow. -Slow.
go! Go!
fast!
what the hell? -Who the hell?
what the hell are you doing here?
shit!
remember me?
thanks for taking your time.
go down the hall. Turn left, then right.
where are we going? -Trust me, okay?
Arthur? -Trust her.
okay, let's go!
what happened to Kathy?
I don't know, she disappeared.
how do you lose an entire family in a glass house?
Arthur!
Kallna, give me a flare!
get him! Go! Get up!
this is not the time to be a girl! Run!
stop dragging your ass, man! Go!
Oh, my God! Go! Run!
now is not the time to sit around, Arthur! Run!
get the door. Close the door!
Arthur, are you all right?
God, what's going on here? Fucking ghosts.
I hate this job.
they don't Like you, either. I wonder why.
you got something to say, say it.
all right. Let's start with: This is all your goddamn fault!
if you hadn't caught them, we wouldn't be running from them.
it was his uncle that built the house!
you helped him. How could you help him without knowing what he was doing?
I had my reasons. -Money, you parasite.
you stole people's souls for money! How depraved is that?
if you haven't noticed, I'm a bit of a freak!
I come within 10 feet of anything dead, I go into seizures.
I touch somebody, a whole life full of shit flashes in front of my eyes.
so, yeah, I'm depraved.
but Cyrus was my friend, and he accepted me.
he didn't accept you. You're so pathetic!
he used you. -Shut up, both of you.
cut him some slack. What difference does it make?
you didn't tell him, did you?
tell me what? What now?
about the fourth ghost.
don't do this. I didn't tell him.
he has a right to know.
what about the fourth ghost?
St. Luke's Hospital. Six months ago.
you're saying my wife's spirit......is trapped in this house?
I didn't know you.
I didn't know her. I didn't know she had a husband.
Why? In God's name, why? Tell me, why her?
I don't know. Cyrus handpicked them, including your wife.
I figured out who you were and I've been trying to help you.
you call this help? She's right! This is all your goddamn fault!
son of a bitch!
you can save her. And your kids, too.
just listen to me and believe me.
this house is not a house.
it is a machine.
a complete and faithful re-creation of Basileus's design.
according to this, there should be 12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.
see these? They represent the black zodiac.
they represent the ghosts that Cyrus needed to catch: The First-Born Son.
I don't want to play.
the Torso.
the Bound Woman.
the Withered Lover.
Jean.
Bobby. I love you.
the Torn Prince.
the Angry Princess.
I'm sorry.
the Pilgrimess.
the Great Child and the Dire Mother.
the Hammer.
and here, the sign of Hell's Winter: The Jackal.
and The Juggernaut.
according to Basileus, The machine required the energy...
...of these specific spirits in order to bring it to life.
once it engages, the spirits are released one by one.
the house then draws them to its center.
each one adds its energy to the machine, powering it up.
powering it up for what?
to open the Ocularis Infernum.
what's that?
it's Latin.
Ocularis Infernum. The Eye of Hell?
very good.
the Eye of Hell. I'm stuck in a glass house with crazy white people...
go on.
in hell, there is an eye that sees everything, the past, the future...heaven and earth, the blessed, the damned.
if knowledge is power, then the man who controls the Ocularis...would be the most powerful man on earth.
your uncle.
great.
so...
...how many ghosts have been set free?
eleven. And the house needs twelve.
no. Damon said something about thirteen.
that there are thirteen ghosts.
the thirteenth ghost is a fall-safe.
to stop the process, the house needs a sacrifice of life instead of death.
a willing, human sacrifice.
a sacrifice of the broken heart.
the only ghost to be created out of an act of pure love.
you're the thirteenth ghost.
the thirteenth spirit stands before the eye at the final configuration.
as the eye opens, the spirit uses the power of life......to short-circuit the system.
uses the power of Life how?
by leaping into the eye.
and Arthur's supposed to take this leap? No fucking way, lady.
that's suicide. I won't let you do it.
you need to come up with something else. That's not working.
love is the most powerful energy.
Meaning?
in order for you to save your children, you must trade your Life for theirs.
let me see this.
there's got to be a better way.
I don't read Latin.
well, we can try it the old-fashioned way, my personal favorite.
nobody will be here to brag about it afterwards.
we need to come up with a game plan soon. Time's running out.
are you going to blow the place up?
the last ghost is about to be released.
I know why you feel you have to do this. -Get away from me.
psychics call it a "linking." We linked earlier. I saw everything...
...about Jean, about you.
shut up. I'm not going to listen to this from you.
Kallna is talking about suicide.
anything to save my kids.
it doesn't add up. It doesn't make any sense.
there's got to be a better way.
doesn't add up? What does add up here, Dennis?
how much of this equation makes any sense at all?
goddamn it. Goddamn it.
all I can think about are my kids.
I don't even know if they're alive.
then let's go out there and find out.
one last time, while there's still time, you and me.
Kallna...
...no matter what I decide to do, or what happens to any of us...
...are you sure you can you stop that machine?
I've got enough explosives to blow us back to the 15th century.
okay.
how many flares do you have left? -One, why?
we're going out again.
no fucking way, Arthur. You're going to get yourself killed.
not if we take that.
we got about ten minutes until the ectoplasmic shit hits the fan.
go.
we'll go down and buy you some time.
after you, Captain America.
damn. I just got my nails done.
here. Put these on.
come on, let's go!
there's no place like home.
there's no place like home. There's no place like home.
there's no place like home.
knock it off, Dennis. Just keep your eyes open.
I sure hope I don't bleed to death.
that would suck.
rotate.
is that half the lawyer?
here, take this. Move it.
Oh, my God. He definitely looked better.
Oh, my God. Shit.
girl, hurry up!
ram him! -He's swinging for the fences!
Kallna, get over here! This flare shit ain't working! Hurry up!
where is it?
where is it?
Kallna?
why are you so mad at me? I did everything you asked me to do.
I killed Damon, I stole his spells.
I made sure your pathetic nephew didn't get himself killed!
Kallna!
where are the spells?
you're not mad at me, are you?
of course not.
what is it? -Oh, shit.
there's only room for one of us.
what are you doing?
don't worry, I've been looking for a reason to like myself for a long time.
Dennis, don't do this!
Hey, bro. You ain't nothing but a bitch!
Dennis, no!
Oh, my God.
what do we do now?
your nephew believes that sacrificing himself will save his kids.
but he won't do it unless his kids are in jeopardy.
well, put them in jeopardy. -What?
why not? -But they're kids.
greatness requires sacrifice.
now, I have a job to do.
and so have you.
do it. Do it!
Yes.
and now to finish this.
Oh, my God. Jean.
I loved you so much.
I miss you.
miss you.
I'm nothing without you.
don't go.
don't go.
fetch the book.
Cyrus! What are you doing?
you just can't teach some people.
I thought I told you, greatness requires sacrifice.
Kathy! -Bobby, don't look.
I don't want to look.
Kathy, I'm scared!
Kathy!
Kathy! Bobby!
daddy!
Bobby!
dad, help!
Oh, my...
make it stop, Dad! Make it stop!
this house is not a house. It's a machine...designed by the devil...and powered by the dead.
according to Basileus, there should be 12 earth-bound spirits trapped inside.
they represent the black zodiac.
they represent the ghosts that Cyrus needed to catch:
the First-Born Son. -One.
the Torso. -Two.
the Bound Woman. -Three.
the Withered Lover. -Four.
the Torn Prince.
the Angry Princess. The Pilgrimess.
the Great Child and the Dire Mother.
the Hammer. The Jackal. And The Juggernaut.
twelve.
you're the thirteenth ghost.
if I'm the thirteenth...
you son of a bitch!
release my kids, you bastard!
damn you! You're nothing, Arthur!
do you hear? You loser!
I've dedicated my entire life to this.
every waking moment, for years.
have you ever shown that kind of dedication? Have you?
the world has no time for little people like you.
it needs people who are willing to do anything!
anything for greatness.
you don't have a choice this time, Arthur.
you will make that leap.
the machine requires a ghost to be created out of an act of pure love。
that's why I chose you, nephew. You and your pathetic family.
make it stop, Dad!
congratulations, you get to become the thirteenth ghost.
get on your feet.
come on!
trust me, Arthur. It's not over yet.
you can finish this.
you still have the power in you.
it's just a matter of how you use it. Go to your kids. They need you.
dad! Help!
daddy, don't! Don't do it!
Oh, fuck!
dad!
don't move!
keep your heads down!
hold on!
everybody okay?
you okay?
how did you know we'd be safe here?
I didn't.
I just wasn't about to leave you guys.
I love you both so much.
mom?
I love you guys.
I love you.
this is it for me.
I am on the first plane back to Newark.
I am sorry, family, Kathy, Bobby, Uncle, ghosts...
...I am sick of this nanny shit.
I've had it. This was not in the job description. I quit!
this is awesome. - Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. This is crazy.
Oh, my God! So incredible.
do you want to know a secret? I took a Viagra.
what? - This is awesome!
why aren't I using this every day?
What'd you do? Wait. Stop, stop, stop.
stop. - What?
what's the matter?
what's the matter?
you just took a Viagra to have sex with me.
I thought it would make it better.
it was better. It takes some of the pressure off.
because you can't get hard without a Viagra?
is it because you don't think I'm sexy?
I thought you'd think it was fun for me to super-size it for once.
that is the worst birthday present you could ever give someone.
I was just trying to go turbo for your birthday.
my hard-ons are still in analog. This shit's digital.
I don't want a turbo penis.
I like your medium-soft one.
look, I can get it up. Just not that far up.
come on. You were liking it. - Forget it. Forget it.
Debbie, come on.
all right, you know what? I'll be honest with you.
lately, my penis hasn't been getting as hard as it used to, all right?
and it's kind of freaked me out.
I don't know whether or not it's because I'm getting older or I'm losing testosterone.
no, it's what I told you. Your artery to your heart is clogged because you eat so much junk food, and you have high cholesterol, and that is directly related to your penis vein.
my "penis vein"? Where'd you get my penis vein?
there was a whole Dr. Oz about it.
cholesterol is not clogging my penis vein.
maybe I can't get a hard-on fully because, you know, I keep my phone in my front pocket, and it's radiating my balls. I'll give you that. That makes sense.
Where'd you even get it from?
a very safe and reputable farmacia.
Mexico? Mexico.
look at this. You want that to go to waste?
looks like a plant trying to reach the sun.
okay, well...
I'll do it for 10 minutes, but you have to figure out what to do with the other four hours.
stop it. Dad, stop.
I love you.
time to get up.
your breath smells weird.
wake up.
I really need you to wake up.
wake up. Come on.
time to wake up. - Okay.
Whoo!
ready!
make a wish!
Hello, Sayid.
can I watch Lost?
you can't handle Lost.
it's too violent, and you won't understand.
if I don't understand it, why can't I handle it?
because you're eight.
I can handle it. I've seen a shark eat a guy on Shark Week.
shark Week is fake.
no, it's not.
all of it is reenactments.
I know, but they...
and that's scary. You shouldn't be allowed to watch that.
they show the reenactments, but they actually happened.
it's gonna give you nightmares.
I can handle a nightmare. You're a nightmare every day for me.
Hey.
don't eat that cupcake.
what?
the one you just put into the sink.
I saw you were hiding that.
this cupcake? You think I'm going to eat this cupcake?
Yeah. - I so don't want this cupcake. Look.
you're still going to eat it. - I'm going to eat that cupcake?
just put it in the trash.
what would you like to do? Your choice.
anything? - Yeah, anything.
just hang out with you guys.
don't you want to get a massage, or do something fun?
it's a big forty's huge.
I'm turning 38.
okay, 38. We will move on.
isn't it weird that our birthday is the same week, and then we're going to have a party, and it's just for me?
no, I don't think it's weird at all.
because you're turning 40 and I'm turning 38.
come on, do you really want to be one of those ladies who's just so insecure about their age?
and they lie, and then they gotta remember, and it gets all...
you don't get it. See, you don't understand how it works.
I don't want to shop at old ladies' stores.
I don't want to go to J. Jill and Chico's, and Ann Taylor Loft.
I'm not ready yet.
I need two more years.
that is so insane, it kind of makes sense.
What'd you get me for my birthday?
wait a minute, I thought you said that we shouldn't get each other gifts this year.
what do you mean?
you're supposed to get me a surprise gift.
this is a big birthday.
I'm turning 40.
mom!
mom, why can't I get new clothes?
what the fuck? Nothing fits me!
God damn it!
I'm going to go work out, I'll be back in about an hour.
Hey, did your father call to wish you a happy birthday?
no, but that's no surprise.
come on. - Coming.
you got to keep up with us, sweetheart. - Yeah, I'm in.
that's why your body looks like your body and her body looks like her body.
before, after. Before, after.
you guys just go on without me. I'm just gonna...
I think I gotta...
fuck.
thanks for letting me join this team.
it's not really a team.
it's just a bunch of guys that get together and ride.
I know, I know. - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hey! Bike lane, asshole!
it's always the guy in the fucking Infiniti.
good. See, you're getting tight here. Yeah.
this, we need to work on. Okay.
so, why on earth is Pete taking Viagra? What's going on?
I don't know.
I think maybe he isn't attracted to me anymore or something.
I don't know. - Well, that is ridiculous.
if you were my girlfriend, I would not need a Viagra.
I would need an anti-Viagra pill...
to try not to get a boner.
but everyone gives you a boner.
don't sell yourself short like that.
you give me a boner.
barb doesn't give me a boner.
maybe things are just getting stale.
that's why if maybe I work out really hard...
maybe he'll be able to get a boner again.
why do you need to have sex, Deb?
sex is the number one thing people fight about.
you stop having sex, there will be no more fights.
I am living proof.
I have no sex, and I am the happiest I have ever been.
I knew it. I knew you were not having sex.
I can see it on your face.
it's all...
puckered and pained.
I'm enjoying our non-sex period, that's all I'm saying.
don't you miss it?
I wouldn't know, because I don't have any feeling down there anymore.
I have nerve damage from my C-section, so everything's just kind of...
she's numb down there.
I could sit down hard on a fire hydrant, and I wouldn't even know that I was sitting.
I could get stung by a hornet down there, and I would not feel it.
you could put anything in there, and I would not know what the object was.
I used to pee in a nice stream, and now it just kind of goes like a shower head.
that is the saddest thing I've ever heard.
I think you need a family. Don't you want a family?
no, I think I want to Clooney it.
Clooney it? - Yup.
he doesn't seem happy.
Yeah, he is.
no, he's lonely.
no, he's not.
see, I think he has sad eyes.
you sweet little thing, no.
he's doing sad, lonely eyes to get the next lady.
look, I can do it, too. Watch.
I bet George Clooney is really lonely.
just him and his pig.
you'd fuck him. - I wouldn't.
so would you. - I would.
I wouldn't feel it, but I would.
you'd fuck him with your numb vagina. Yes, you would.
ocean's Thirteen Inches, that's what you'd find out.
do you think?
I mean, that was idiotic, though. You have to understand that.
that's the one thing you don't do, is tell her that you used Viagra.
I think that's even on the warning label.
we're in one of those phases where everything that the other person says just annoys the shit out of each other.
all the time. It's a blast. - Don't worry about it.
you just gotta ride that out.
this sounds terrible.
okay, I like it.
but...
do you ever wonder what it would be like if, say, you were separated by something bigger.
like death? Like her death?
I have given it a fair amount of thought.
not in a painful way, just quietly slid into death.
like a gas leak.
Absolutely. It's gotta be peaceful.
I mean, this is the mother of your children.
you want her to die...
no, I'd want it to be a peaceful...
gentle, you know.
Yeah, just like drift into a coma from which she never awakens.
and then you move on. Then you are a widower.
that's just it, people love widowers.
they love widowers. It's like the polar opposite of divorced guys.
it's the best.
it's like, "Oh, that poor widower.
if I could only make him happy.
somehow, ease his pain.
Cock-suck away his sadness.
do you know that this song, Pixies did this song, it's about a Salvador Dali short film called Un Chien Andalusia.
this music doesn't make people happy.
this song kicks off Doolittle, one of the best albums of the last 30 years.
look how angry you get while listening to it.
an important record.
it's my birthday. You don't control the radio on my birthday.
I do.
I control the radio on my birthday.
Sadie's watching Lost.
Sadie, how many times have you watched Lost this week?
I only watched 11. But I have eight more, and then I'm done, so...
how many are there? - 114.
are you kidding me?
you can't watch over 100 episodes of a show in five weeks.
it'll melt your brain.
it's not melting my brain, it's blowing my mind.
that's really bad, Sadie.
you're not allowed to do that.
my relationship with Lost is not your business.
it's extremely personal.
stop!
stop it. Be nice to your sister.
you guys are going to cherish each other one day.
stop it! Stop!
it's your birthday. You don't need to go to the store.
no, just five minutes. Desi and Jodi are fighting.
all right, five minutes, but then I'm pulling you out.
Hi.
Hi.
how's Jodi treating you?
Jodi?
Oh, Jodi's my new BFF.
she's like a little kitty-cat.
sometimes she comes and rubs up against my leg.
and you're a ball of shit.
she loves me.
huh.
can you do inventory so that we can do the sidewalk sale?
and you really need to pay attention to the numbers because we have $12, 000 unaccounted for.
I think it's probably Desi.
she's been having a really hard time using these simple computers.
it's because she's stupid.
I think she might be stealing.
she's not stealing.
she's our best employee. She made nine grand last month.
how much did I make?
you brought in $2, 200.
that's not bad.
well, it's not that good.
I mean, I'm not comparing you, but you're not as good.
all right. See you.
I don't think she's wearing underwear.
what? - It's all dark up there.
why are you looking?
I didn't mean to look.
I just said, "Hey, whoa." And there it was.
maybe she's wearing dark underwear.
Yeah, maybe she has underwear that has a picture of a vagina painted on it.
stop looking.
some deep oranges and browns, and maybe some dark greens.
that would really play up your features.
I'll just take out my AmEx and you pick what stuff you think's good.
Whoo!
good job!
Whoo!
Where's Daddy?
I think he went to poop.
Pete!
Q-A-T. Suck on that, bitch.
Hey. What are you doing?
going to the bathroom.
we're all downstairs, waiting for you.
you've been up here for a really long time now.
I'm almost done. I'll be down in a second.
Charlotte just did her first flip on the trampoline and she landed on her feet.
she was really proud of herself.
that's great! - And you missed it.
she'll do it again.
it's the fourth time you've gone to the bathroom today.
give me a break.
why is your instinct to escape?
it's not my instinct to escape from you.
it is my instinct to come into the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom.
you want me to hook up cable in here or something?
you need DirecTV?
well, it's probably too late for this dump, but if you could do that for the next one, I'd be psyched.
how come I don't smell anything?
it's because I shoved an Altoid up my ass before I came in here.
let me see, then.
what? - Let me see.
no, I'm not going to let you see.
you're not going to let me see, because you're not taking a poop.
I've been flushing as I go.
you're flushing as you go.
who takes a half-hour to go to the bathroom?
John Goodman.
don't press "Enter." I'm not sure I want to make that move!
thank you. Wow.
you know, when I first started this label, my dream was to work with musicians and bands whose music I just admired so much.
the person that I thought, "My God, wouldn't it be incredible to work with, was Graham Parker.
tonight, we have him, solo because we couldn't afford to fly in The Rumour.
Graham Parker.
it's just not my kind of music.
Really? What is your kind of music?
I like happy music that you can dance to.
Yeah, but when you listen to a song where somebody's singing about something depressing, don't you relate to it? - No.
it makes you feel the same as they...
it makes you feel you're a part of the human race.
I don't feel like that.
I like Lady Gaga.
Oh, God, of course you do.
what? - Shallow dance music.
it's not. It is fun.
and it's about release and sex and power.
you don't have to like it. It's really not for you, that's fine.
this is a job. This is not a hobby.
can't you love him, just as a hobby and sign a 15-year-old hot girl so we can eat?
Graham Parker & The Rumour had two albums in the Rolling Stone Top 500 Best Albums of All Time.
two of them.
if I can just sell 10, 000 records to his hardcore fanbase, we're golden.
the last of Graham Parker's fans just died.
I do know. Hardly. -That sort of music depresses people.
Hi, Charlotte.
Sadie. Sadie, what are you listening to?
okay. This is music that makes people happy.
and this is what people buy.
what?
right, girls?
come on, Sadie.
okay.
why did you take it off?
now, something that really rocks.
this is called good music.
from somebody's heart.
this is bumming me out. This isn't fun.
just listen to these words, okay? Just listen to the words.
I don't understand the words.
this is lyrics. This is poetry.
this is what is going to survive in a hundred years.
it just doesn't make people happy.
makes me happy. I can dance to it.
but you're the only one in the room who's happy.
sometimes I wish just one of you had a dick.
well, we don't want one.
is there something that you can do to be helping me right now?
Yeah, I'm ready to help. Just tell me what to do.
can you go get a lunch box or something?
for me or for them?
Charlotte! I've got a test!
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Charlotte, I'm going to kill you!
Hi, Debbie.
Hi. Any day now, huh?
not really. Three months, still.
Hi. - Hi.
Katie's dying for a play date. Let's hook these two up.
that would be great. Okay, I'll call you. Great.
okay, great.
no.
no, what? - No.
what? - No.
she's sweet.
she's evil.
hello. Hi. - Hi.
listen, Charlotte really needs to get here on time because she needs the extra time to just settle in.
Oh. We are on time.
being on time means being early.
okay.
it's nice to see you in class. We'd like to see more of you.
I come to...
Hi, Debbie.
grandma Molly.
how are you? I'm so happy about the science fair.
thank you for coming. - It's going very well, I heard.
Yeah. - I love you. You look so beautiful!
happy birthday. I just learned that you're 40.
are you 40?
Yeah.
I remember when I was 40, and then I blinked, and there I was, going to be 90.
my God, where did it go?
one day, you're going to blink and you're going to be 90.
and I won't be around to see it, and that makes me very sad.
I'm telling you. I'm warning you.
don't blink. Don't blink.
and then you missed the mortgage payment, and that's the second mortgage.
you gotta tighten your belt. You gotta go home, sit down, look at your expenses, come clean with Debbie.
Oh, God. I can't tell Debbie.
you've got to tell her, Pete.
I mean, she knows it's bad, but she has no idea just how bad.
if you sell the house, it'll really buy you some time.
no, Debbie's not really into selling the house.
as your business manager and your friend, I can't recommend that.
Hey, how funny would it be if I bought your house?
okay. - Bye.
hang in there.
from the retro label, Unfiltered, comes the first Graham Parker & The Rumour record in 30 years.
when we play together, the magic was just ridiculous.
and I think what we've got is just so great.
what are you doing?
I'm contextualizing him as one of the great figures in rock history.
you can't show him in his prime in '77, and then jump straight to him as he is now.
it's terrifying.
you have got to reverse it. You have got to show him as he is now, very briefly, and then show him in 1977.
you have got to Benjamin Button it.
I don't know what you're talking about. All rock stars are older now.
steven Tyler, David Bowie, Mick Jagger...
paul McCartney. - Okay. Stop it.
everybody that you are mentioning looks like an old woman now.
you're just mentioning a bunch of Jessica Tandys.
Keith Richards gets away with it.
but that's because Keith Richards looked 70 when he was 40.
and now that he's 70, he looks 69.
he's regenerating.
I like it, and I think Graham Parker's sexy.
well, would you fuck him?
Yes. - You'd...
you'd fuck him and you won't fuck me?
I mean, I kind of fuck you once - if you could have finished. - Oh. I finished.
okay, enough of who fucked who and who finished what.
I finished.
look, it's a retro label. That's our niche, that's our market.
it costs money to break new bands. I can't do that.
okay, and also, you're the guy who turned down Arcade Fire.
everybody turned down Arcade Fire.
it's crazy. There's so many of them.
we don't have the money to market a new band.
we just need to make Graham seem relevant.
who's he talking to?
the Jewish Journal.
the Jewish Journal?
apparently, old Jews are the only ones who still buy hard copy of records.
because they don't like to download music.
because they don't know what "downloading" means.
why is this album different from any other album?
it isn't.
what is he wearing?
it's a hat with the Oreo logo on it.
Why? - I don't think he's being ironic.
I think he just really likes Oreos.
look, Paul Westerberg record did okay.
Frank Black record did all right.
the Haircut One Hundred, not so much.
we have to break this record. Otherwise, we're not here next year.
he's coming, he's coming. Oreo Man is coming.
Hey, guys, how are you?
good, man.
aren't cookies the best? - Yeah.
jewish Journal guy loves the record.
great!
got a bit of a problem, though. A touch of gout.
Gout?
my whole family, they all had gout.
Jesus. - That's very unfortunate.
my auntie Queenie, she had a foot like this.
it's like a size of a small pig. I've got a photo of it.
I'd love to see that photo of that gout foot.
and a couple of bunions as well.
fuck.
I've got to go to the podiatrist, and I hope he can shoot me up with something.
Yeah, well, let's get you to the podiatrist.
Bye, Graham. - See you later, Graham.
good luck with your gout.
rock and roll, baby.
the happiest period in people's lives is from age 40 to 60.
so, this is it. We're in it right now.
it's true. - Says who?
says a lot of people. Most people say that. - Oh!
we have everything we need right now to be completely happy.
we're going to blink, and be 90. - What?
so, let's just choose to be happy.
Yeah. Yeah.
your eyes are kind of glazing over.
no, I'm processing it all.
some of these, I wrote for you.
so, we have to exercise every day. - Mmm.
spend more time alone together.
and we have to go to the therapist, every week.
it's a little pricey.
no stressing over tiny things.
Yeah, that's good. You should do that. Mm-hmm.
we have to get more involved in school.
Yeah. - Have more patience with the kids.
and we need to work on our anger.
Yeah, I think it would be good if you could take care of your anger.
no, I said both of us.
that's what I said. Our anger.
okay, and no more smoking.
Yeah, you gotta cut that out.
I don't want to make this about a fight. I want to just be positive.
Yeah. Sorry.
okay, and then no more holding onto resentments.
we have to just let that go.
so, you're saying that if we're arguing, and I apologize, you'll let it go?
and not throw it back in my face later?
well, I don't do that, but I will continue not to do that.
and what did you write?
all of that. That's plenty. That's a lot.
and you're going to eat better?
Oh, yeah. I've been doing a decent job.
but I don't think there's anything wrong with having some fries every now and again.
and then I'll smoke that day.
that's not the same thing. - It is the same thing.
I like fries.
and the other thing is your dad's stuff, the not letting him guilt-trip you all the time because that puts a lot of pressure on you, and stress, and then the whole family feels it.
and he is a grown man, and he's not our responsibility.
and you're not giving him money anymore, right?
no. No, I haven't been giving him money.
I haven't done that for years. I told you.
can you please put that down?
a lot of people are RSVP-ing to your birthday party.
you sure you don't want to just do a joint birthday party?
no.
we always used to. - No.
did Jodi tell you she thinks Desi's stealing?
are you serious?
how much? - $12, 000.
Oh, God.
and Desi's taking it?
well, I don't know.
that's what Jodi said.
we really need the store to work.
it is.
don't put that kind of pressure on me.
no, no. It's not what I mean. I'm just...
are you nervous about money?
are we okay?
Yeah. - All right.
maybe we just suck it up because she's clearly earning so much more than any other employee we have.
Oh, yeah, for sure. We can't fire her.
we're barely breaking even with her.
that's why we have to keep her.
look at this. She's making out with somebody.
is she screwing him?
that might be like a dry hump.
look at the position of her skirt.
that's too grainy to know for sure.
Oh, my God. This is in the middle of the day. Customers could be in there.
at least she's getting some.
what did you say? "At least she's getting some"?
Yes.
what are you talking about? We had sex the other night.
you gotta give me a little credit for that.
it's not about credit. It's about...
we need to have more passion.
like this.
that's not passionate.
it looks passionate to me.
what?
what is she doing? - Okay.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh.
don't do that. - What am I doing?
don't fart in the bed.
I'm not. It's the springs.
this is why we never have sex.
that's disgusting, you're gross.
I don't know what you're talking about.
you're so...
God!
Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie
Charlotte, I'm doing my homework.
okay, watch this. Watch this.
there's a haunted cow back here.
I'm pretty sure it does not have milk.
moo.
Moo!
see that? They took me away.
you're no fun. You never want to play.
Charlotte, how many times do I have to tell you?
Sadie, Sadie, Sadie
Sadie is boring.
you're so mean since your body got weird.
close the door.
you're no fun.
if you can just move just a little bit more.
Oh, shit.
Ah!
Ow. Ow.
no, my boob is in there!
did I tell you that my son's going to Stanford?
no, that's great. - Great for us, and great for him.
cough again. - Great school.
everything looks good.
your face is close to my face.
descending colon.
I'm about four feet in right now.
that's what he said.
just try to breathe through your nose.
that's your mouth. Breathe through your nose.
are you all right?
are you a grinder? Do you grind your teeth?
I grind all night.
Oh!
I think we need to turn the gas down.
turn it up!
no, we're going to turn it down.
turn it up!
Ooh!
do you have to breathe right on my neck?
sorry.
what are you all doing for Christmas?
um, I don't know.
you have a tree and everything? - Mm-hmm.
isn't that fun? In the spirit?
sorry, I just had one quick question.
on your form, you said you were born in 1974, but your paper, it said '72. So I just need to know which it is.
it's 1974.
Oh, wait. Because on your last form, you said that you were born in 1975.
didn't you tell me you were born in 1976?
no. That's funny.
so, you want to go with 1974?
I'm not gonna "go with" 1974. It is 1974.
okay.
just remember to write "1974" every time.
it's okay. It's 1976.
I lie about my age, okay?
okay. - Okay? Okay? Okay?
okay. - Okay.
you're tightening up.
Oh, my gosh.
I know how old you are by counting the rings.
a little gyno joke.
Oh, my God. Please.
what are you doing?
getting ready to go for my ride.
you want a blowjob?
Yeah. Why?
I really want a cigarette right now.
wow, happy to help.
Charlotte, where is my backpack?
Hello?
mom's busy!
why are you locking the door?
mom, what's going on in there?
mom, I can't be late for school. I have a test.
mommy can't talk right now!
this isn't funny, Mom. I need to go!
mom, let me in! Please!
that's not gonna help!
put on your shoes. We'll meet you in the car.
Ow. Sadie hurt me! - I didn't!
so, hit her back!
she's faking.
I'm not! - Go downstairs!
please! Sadie gave me a...
stop crying! - Stop crying!
stop it! - God damn it!
quit killing each other! - Mom, please come out.
shut up! - Stop it!
open the door! - Go away!
open it up! Please!
forget it.
no, don't forget it, don't forget it. Don't, don't...
Oh, God.
Hey, boychik!
Hey!
it's the 11: 00 from London.
drop something valuable, you shit!
how you doing? - How are you, bubeleh?
that's loud. - Every eight minutes, buddy.
you look pretty good. Your hair is different.
Yeah, I'm growing it out.
I'd get it cut.
daddy, you never play with me.
I do, but right now, look who I'm talking to.
Hi. - It's your brother!
Hi. - You don't look like my brother.
I told you, honey, that's because of the egg donor.
remember? - I came from a test tube!
how's business? - It's not good.
nobody wants curtains.
they think of it like a luxury. It's not a luxury.
you need shade. You need privacy.
who wants to have other people watch you fuck?
I know how you feel.
my business is going through some growing pains right now.
daddy! - Daddy!
don't jump on Daddy. Be careful, don't jump on Daddy!
remember, Daddy has high blood what?
high blood pressure.
that's right. My daddy's old.
can you go outside without me for a little bit?
Yeah. - Don't go near that little pool!
all right? - We're going to pee in the pool.
do The Three Stooges routine you were practicing.
I can't tell them apart.
I swear to God, I need tattoos.
look, I wanted to talk to you about scaling back a little bit.
you know, Deb and I are... We're thinking about selling the house.
I think that house is more than you need.
I think it was too big of a purchase when you made it.
Yeah. In the meantime, I'm going to have to make some changes.
I'm going to have to cut back.
I understand. What do you mean?
with you. - Oh.
I'm sorry. What?
I can't lend you any more money.
no, that's a bad idea. That's not the way to cut back.
I have three children here.
what about Claire? Can't she get a job?
Claire takes care of your brothers!
what do you want her to do?
if she goes to work, then I gotta hire somebody!
well, you've got to figure something out because I can't do it. I can't do it.
okay, fine. Why don't we kill them?
come on, we'll kill two of them.
I'll keep the best one.
really, it'll save us both a lot of trouble.
come on. Line up!
line up for murder! Come on!
who wants to be killed? - I do!
okay, we're eliminating one already. We're cheaper. You're gone.
murder me. - Okay. Boom. Dead!
I'm dead! - You're dead! You're dead!
kill me, kill me! - All right, the kids are murdered.
that will save us some money. - Daddy is the best!
why would you have three kids, anyway?
I mean, you're 60 years old. You have no money.
because Claire wanted a baby.
if we didn't at least try, she would have left me.
she was 45 years old. Nobody thought it would take.
the doctor, when we're doing in vitro, is winking at me like...
don't worry, don't worry.
we were very unlucky.
and now, we have these three beautiful children.
come on. I gotta tell you something.
what?
your mother wanted you aborted.
Oh. Jesus Christ.
no, no. It's the truth.
you know, it was the '70s. We were 22 years old.
that's what everybody did. You did some blow, had sex, had an abortion.
Really? - Yes.
we were on the way to the doctor's office.
I said, "Let's stop, have a pizza, talk about it.
if you still wanna do it after lunch, it's okay.
the pizza saved your life.
but don't give me money, because I'm not worth it.
so, how much do I owe you for saving my life?
I don't have a number. You just keep giving like you're giving.
Hey. Oh, hi, Pete.
Hey. - Hey.
why aren't you playing with the kids?
we were playing all day with them.
Pete is just talking to me about his 40th birthday party.
whatever I can do to help.
okay. Did you feed them?
I fed half of one.
half of...
let's go, we'll feed them. Mommy will feed them.
who wants tuna with a side of jet fuel?
Hi, I'm looking for my dad. I mean, an older man.
so, how's Sony treating Pete?
he's not with Sony anymore. He went out on his own.
now he's able to focus on the artists that he's really passionate about.
hmm.
how's Sadie doing?
the last time I saw her, she was throwing her Cheerios on the floor.
what a mess.
right.
she just got her period.
well, I guess she's not a little baby anymore.
it would be nice to see more of each other.
well, we can certainly arrange for that. I'd love to see the girls.
that would be nice. Mm-hmm. It would.
do you have a day that is better... a good day?
I would say the weekends, but our weekends are hell.
soccer competitions, kids' exams.
right, right. - I mean, we're both so busy.
I have young children, you have young children.
I don't think we should judge ourselves too harshly about that.
I know, I wasn't... I didn't say anything.
no, I'm glad we're here. I think this is a good start.
and then, we can spend more time together, it'd be nice.
it'd be nice.
do you want to see pictures of the kids?
Oh. Yeah.
this is Kel, my son.
he's handsome. He's 13? - Mm-hmm.
and that's Alexandra, my daughter. She's a real perfectionist.
a lot like you.
that's the whole gang at Cabo.
excuse me, dear, I gotta go to the restroom.
be right back. - Okay.
daddy and I are making some changes so that we can be happier and healthier.
and we're starting with this meal that I prepared.
I think it looks great. - Doesn't it look good?
what is that, grilled cheeses?
no, baked tofu. - Oh.
it's actually really tasty.
and the lettuce is so fresh and tasty that you forget how good lettuce tastes on its own, without dressing.
no, dressing always gets in the way of the natural taste of the lettuce.
and another thing we've decided is to cut back on all of the electronics we use.
basically, what we're going to do, is get rid of the Wi-Fi and only use the computer...
what? - From 8: 00 to 8: 30 at night.
how are we gonna go on the computer?
we're gonna have a hard line in the kitchen.
Yeah. We'll supervise that.
you can't do this. You can't take away the Wi-Fi.
no Wi-Fi! A-ha-ha.
you don't spend enough time with the family when you're constantly on your iPhone and your computer.
and, you know, you're only here for five more years.
so, you won't see me after five years?
no, but you won't be living with us.
and you should get to know your little sister.
you've got the perfect friend, right here.
I don't wanna be friends with her now.
I'll be friends with her when she's 20 and a normal person.
I don't wanna hang out with her when I'm in my 20s.
you're on the computer too much as it is.
you need to get outside more, do some playing outside.
Yeah, you could build things. You could build a fort outside.
what? - Yeah, build a fort.
play with your friends and have...
make a fort? Outside?
and do what?
do what in the fort?
when I was a kid, we used to build tree houses and play with sticks.
nobody plays with sticks.
you and Charlotte can have a lemonade stand.
play kick the can.
look for dead bodies.
it's fun. That's fun to do.
get a tire and then just take a stick and run down a street with it.
nobody does that crap. It's 2012.
you don't need technology.
no technology!
Charlotte, put that down.
I don't need to be monitored all the time on the computer.
I don't do anything bad.
nobody said you were bad.
I don't do things I'm not supposed to.
I don't illegally download music.
I don't look at porn like Wendy.
she is up to no good. She's not allowed to come over here anymore.
what's porn?
no, she said "corn.
this isn't turning out the way I wanted it to.
I'm not hungry.
no computer. - Listen to your mom.
I need to use it for my homework.
she's outplaying us.
I know. She's tough.
this is the best birthday present.
it's good to get away.
we haven't been to Laguna without the kids in years.
I know. - If we're happy, they're happy.
Yeah, I mean, I can't take it.
with the hormones, and the crying.
Jesus. - And "do my homework.
them's lil' bitches.
them's lil' bitches. Bugging us for shit all the time.
and they never appreciate anything.
No! God, no. They're selfish assholes.
Aw, I feel bad. I love them.
I know.
I miss them already. Should we go home?
Nah.
why do we fight?
I don't know, it makes no sense.
it makes no sense.
when we get in a fight, look at my eyes and let's remember this moment, right now, and know that we never have to fight.
but you're such a dick sometimes.
I know, I am a dick sometimes.
people think I'm so nice, but I'm such a dick.
thank you for admitting that.
and you get so mad at me, I feel like you want to kill me.
I do want to kill you.
how would you do it?
I don't know. I'd poison you.
I'd poison your cupcakes that you pretend not to eat every day.
and just put enough in to just slowly weaken you.
I love it.
I would enjoy our last few months together. -Me too.
because you'd be so weak and sweet.
and I could take care of you...
but while killing you.
see, you know what I love about us?
you can still surprise me.
I figured, for sure, you'd knock me out with one fell swoop of poison.
but you would extend it over a series of months.
have you ever thought about killing me?
Oh, yeah. - Really?
sure.
how would you do it? - Wood chipper.
a wood chipper? - Yeah.
a wood chipper.
Yeah.
Wow.
I know. Did you see "Fargo"?
Yeah.
Ugh.
that's a bad plan. The cupcakes is a way better plan.
it is. You're right.
you know what? I won't murder you.
Aw!
I love you.
I love you, too.
do you know what I brought? - What?
a medical marijuana cookie. Ben gave it to me last Christmas.
what?
Yeah. I brought it. - You did?
chocolate chip kooky.
should we do it?
let's eat the cookie and then we'll order a bunch of cheeseburgers.
let's order the entire room service menu.
just get all of it. You deserve it, you really do.
wouldn't you rather have me around for less years and I'm incredibly happy, than longer and miserable?
Yes, and I just realized that right now.
go get the cookie. - I'm getting the cookie.
go get the cookie.
Ow!
should we watch porn when we eat the cookie?
Yeah. Should we get a block of porn?
I don't think we need 24 hours of porn.
but you know, two porns costs just about as much as a 24-hour block.
I think that's too much porn.
we don't have to watch it all, but for the value, it makes sense.
how much are we supposed to eat?
I don't know. I think six or seven cookies, right?
Plus, it's old, it probably has lost some of its...
potency.
we should have sex more.
I mean, girls have it so easy.
you just show up with your sexual organs and you're good to go.
all the pressure is on the guy.
it's true.
and I look at guys... Like, I look at a guy like Prince, and you know that guy fucks.
Yeah.
I know I don't fuck like Prince.
prince can fuck. - Uh-huh.
I fuck like David Schwimmer.
you do.
you know, I fuck like Ross from "Friends."
Mmm.
looks good.
how does he do it?
the floating spoon.
check it out. It's my dick and balls.
Oh, my God. I don't eat my own dick.
I ate my dick!
Kelly, I think this room has rodents.
there! Just saw it.
have you seen my starfish?
where did I put my starfish?
my God.
I'm gonna deep throat this eclair.
I wanna make out with you so bad.
I felt like I was gonna choke!
that was nice.
that was nice.
mom, Charlotte's crying because she's got an ear infection again.
I didn't know what to do.
we're home.
are you okay?
what's the matter?
I wanna rip my ear off, it hurts so much.
I told you that pediatrician didn't know what he was talking about.
come on, you can't blame it on our doctor.
ear infections are common in little kids.
not in kids over six years old.
we're going to the Eastern doctor.
if she's in this much pain, then we should call a real doctor.
are you kidding right now?
I know. Okay. Yup.
what we should do is easy and simple.
no more dairy, no more wheat, no more sugar.
sugar, wheat and dairy. Okay. - Yeah.
what the fuck is left?
sorry.
isn't everything sugar, wheat, and dairy?
she can have vegetables and fruits.
Oh, but she can eat fruits.
fruits. Yeah.
any kind of fruit?
mangos, pineapple.
it isn't, there are safe fruits, and then there are unsafe fruits? - No, no.
what about French fries?
could we do something like that? - Are you okay?
would you like to come on the table? - I'm okay, I'm...
why don't you go on the table?
I don't wanna go on the table.
no. - It looks like you need to get on the table.
I don't wanna get on the table.
Pete!
God damn it.
what are you doing?
I need you to look at something. In my butt.
Why?
I think I got something in there, and I'm not limber enough to see.
I need you to look at it, all right?
I think I might have an anal fissure, or a hemorrhoid, or a worm or something.
what are you doing with your phone?
I'm trying to take pictures of it so I can compare it to something on Google.
can we just keep just a small shred of mystery in our relationship, please?
look, I saw you have two babies, okay?
seriously, I need you to get up all in that.
I do not want to investigate your anus.
payback time.
it's a hemorrhoid.
thank you.
now, erase that from your memory.
Where'd she get those clothes? Those are expensive clothes.
think. Where do you think?
I don't want this to sound harsh, but everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie.
everything that goes into it is a dick.
everything that goes in is dicks?
a dick.
don't say that.
I'm sorry. I'm just being protective of the store.
I'm going to go talk to her.
Hey, Desi.
Hi. - Hi.
is that your new Acura out front?
uh, yeah.
it's so nice.
do you love it?
I mean, it's not a fucking Porsche, but it'll do for now.
huh.
Hey, Desi, would you mind wearing some of the clothes that we have in the store?
Yes. Yeah, I'm sorry.
will that be okay? - Yeah.
perfect.
good?
you know, I actually made this one myself.
did you? - Yeah.
the tiger, I did it on a piece of paper separately, and then I actually transferred it to the T-shirt.
Wow.
so, you stenciled on the tiger?
I drew it on a piece of paper and then
I transferred the drawing to the T-shirt.
you have an amazing body.
Really?
Yes. Are those real?
my boobs? - Yeah.
Yeah. Do you wanna touch them?
Really?
touch them.
okay.
Wow.
huh.
Jesus.
I mean, they really are amazing. That's firm, for real.
they're like a memory mattress.
it's, wow, like Tempur-Pedic, you know?
they look amazing.
my kids just sucked the meat right out of mine.
no. - Yeah.
there's some meat in there.
my boobs are just gone. Since I had kids, my boobs are just gone.
they didn't even say goodbye, you know? They just left.
by the time I'm 40, these are gonna go National Geographic on me.
I feel bad about myself right now.
I think this is a really good offer on the house.
we expected more.
I know it's a bad market, but that's still way under what we were looking for.
I know, but based on what the market's like, it's like you're gaining money, because it's so much more than what you deserve.
but these people are from Iran and they don't really know that they're offering too much.
is there any chance that Debbie will go for it?
I doubt it. I mean, I don't know.
there's a lot of inventory out there.
I mean, what is her problem?
she has unrealistic expectations.
I'm faster than you!
we're Jewish!
Hey! Did you miss me, Travis?
it's Jack.
Hey, Jack.
my daddy doesn't know my name!
okay, come on, let's go.
can I go show them my crystals before they leave?
Yeah, really quick.
it's all right with me. Elevator down!
okay. Go play with your tiny uncles.
let's play murder! - Yeah. Let's go.
so, what are you doing? Spring cleaning?
I'm getting rid of everything in the house that has gluten or sugar.
Why? What's wrong with gluten?
Gluten's really bad for you.
I don't think so. It's wheat.
don't you watch Dr. Oz?
as in, "The Wizard of"?
Hey, Mom, we were wondering if we can use the computer to iChat?
remember the rules? 8: 00 to 8: 30.
Yeah, but I have a friend over.
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, I know.
why don't you guys go play? You could go build a fort!
Hey, remember the Alamo?
have you ever built a fort, Wendy?
like, on Facebook?
I will take this if you're gonna throw it away, because at our house, we're wheat-eaters.
but don't you want to live long enough to see your kids grow up?
that's up to God, honey.
no, but that's really not good for the kids.
eh, the kids eat grass, this is fine.
Wendy's mom lets her go on whenever she wants.
Yeah, my mom's pretty cool about it as long as I finish my homework.
Yeah.
well, I guess I'm not the cool one, but the rules are just different in our house.
well, I get better grades than Wendy.
she does. She's so smart.
let me just grab the candy worms.
see, your rules are ridiculous.
don't sass me.
I'm only sassing you because you're throwing out all the food in our house and I'm freaking starving.
you're being stupid.
Wendy, could you go stand in the other room, please?
Yeah. - Mom.
give me your iPhone, now.
the nougat things are good.
I have all my contacts in there.
okay, if you don't give me your phone right now, then I'm gonna have to take away your phone and your computer.
Jesus Christ, I need my computer to do homework.
that's it. No phone, no computer.
this is B. S.
this is a bunch of F-ing S. You're acting like a B.
kids! Time to go!
you go to your room, right now.
you are not allowed to use iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, iTunes, Netflix,
pandora, or Spotify.
she's a little pip, just like her mommy.
so, I might have a job tomorrow.
at least, I'm gonna go try to give an estimate.
do you mind taking the kids for a couple of hours?
um...
okay.
this is nice.
you and I don't spend enough time together, do we?
we spend enough time together.
we do?
it's quality time.
then we do.
I'll go with what you think.
what else did they say?
all right, some kid named Joseph...
I know Joseph. - You do?
he's making a "hot-or-not" list.
what?
Sadie said, "That's so lame and immature that you're doing that."
and then Joseph says, "Yo, girl, we're just having some fun.
so don't be a bitch, yo."
that is not nice.
so then Sadie said, "Don't call me a bitch."
and Joseph said, "I didn't call you a bitch.
I said don't act like a bitch.
and by the way, you're in the 'Not-Hot' column."
who made him the judge of "hot"?
do you realize what that could do to her self-esteem?
what a little fuckhead. I'll kill him.
then Sadie said, "You're in the jackass column.
I gotta go, I'm bored of you.
that is cool. That's taking the high road.
and then, for some reason, there's an emoticon of a panda doing push-ups.
I wonder what that means.
I don't think it means anything. I think it's just adorable.
Aww.
well, she's a good girl.
she was polite and she stood up for herself.
that's pretty cool.
what?
shit. - What?
I thought she was coming in.
Oh, my God, that scared me to death.
if she caught us, she would kill us.
she would. She would kill us.
huh.
I gotta make a call.
we sold how many?
612 album downloads.
wait a minute. There are no zeroes after that?
there are zeroes, but all of them are before 612.
there are none after.
how is that even possible?
well, out of 300 million Americans, 612 people chose to download the album.
you could personally call everyone who bought this record.
we're fucked, we're fucked.
here's the deal, I want you to meet me tomorrow morning at 8: 00.
I want a list of at least 30 ideas of what we can do to change this.
we have to change this.
I started a record label because I couldn't get a job, so I have no other options.
what financial problems?
well, I mean, for one thing, you were right.
you are missing about $10, 000 from the store.
and then, Pete's record not selling well.
Pete's record not selling...
I thought we weren't supposed to hear for three weeks.
we heard. - You heard?
and they're bad.
it's that and it's the money that he's been lending his father.
that's creating a strain.
how much have we lent him?
eighty thousand.
did you say 8, 000 or 80, 000?
80, 000, over the past couple of years.
and then you missed the mortgage payment.
on the house?
and you missed the rental on the office.
does Pete know that?
Yeah, we're on the phone all the time.
look, I know you're going through a hard time.
and I want you guys to know that we're here for you, okay?
anything you guys need, that's why we're here.
we're here for times like this.
what are you gonna do?
there's not much I can do.
what are you doing?
I'm drawing the album cover for Van Halen's DiverDown.
if you spent a little bit more time focusing on Graham Parker instead of drawing album covers,
I wouldn't be in this predicament.
I'm focused on Graham Parker.
you're supposed to help me with him.
you're supposed to call the companies.
you're supposed to get people to the show.
I've done everything I can, Pete.
you had me pushing around a corpse.
it was like being in fucking Weekend at Graham's.
what should we do? I'm out of ideas.
you fly in The Rumour.
I can't sell a reunion concert without the band, it's ridiculous.
with what? I can't afford it.
you put this on yourself. You wanted the responsibility.
take it on the fucking chin, and stop acting like a bitch.
what did you call me?
chin.
Pete. Wait, Pete!
Hey, I have an apartment.
I have health insurance, I have car payments.
I have responsibilities.
you have responsibilities? Don't talk to me about responsibilities.
I have a life. I have a family.
I can't afford to sit in my apartment getting high, jerking off, and then going to Tommy's Chili Burgers at 3: 00 in the morning.
that's not even the order that that happens in!
I have everything to lose, here. Everything.
Yes, because you spent thousands of dollars on shit we don't need.
you really need to spend $30, 000 on a fucking neon sign, dude?
which is inside, it's not even outside. We know where we work.
if you want to sign a band, you gotta look like you're the real deal.
princess Labia, how much is it to fucking fly The Rumour in?
it's 12, 000.
$12, 000!
all right, you know what? Fine.
fly in The Rumour. Put it on my AmEx.
no, you said it was impossible.
I don't think I said "impossible.
Yeah.
I usually don't say "impossible.
I like to leave some wiggle room.
you said that my fibroid was like a giant boulder, like the one from the Indiana Jones movies - blocking up my uterus. - Uterus.
and I need to stop using that reference of Indiana Jones.
I think that that's not appropriate when talking about the reproductive system.
it's okay.
anyway, somehow the Eastern medicine has worked, and the fibroid has dissipated.
that's great! - Yes.
Wow. - Yes.
your fibroid shrunk and somehow it allowed you to get pregnant.
what?
you're gonna have your third baby.
Congratulations.
no.
Yes.
would you like some water?
that's good news.
another baby.
at 40.
Debbie?
I am thrilled.
and Pete is gonna be so happy.
so, you're okay?
what a relief.
because I can finally relax now, you know?
it's been, like...
it's okay.
I'm so happy, though, you know?
I really am, because, I mean...
it's good.
great. Great.
Hey. - Hey.
why are you in a bathrobe? It's the middle of the afternoon.
I took a late shower. Why are you busting my balls?
I'm sorry about the record.
you're going through financial shit. This is what I live with.
this is a horrible time in human history. What is that?
it's something that might help both of our situations.
this is a drawing by John Lennon.
I got it 10 years ago for $5, 000.
I don't know how much it's worth now.
it could be five, it could be 20.
I don't want this.
I don't even like it. I'm not gonna hang it up.
it's not for you to hang up. It's for you to sell.
that way, I can give it to you and you make some money, and Debbie won't know that I'm giving you anything.
you're not giving me money. You're giving me a project.
I don't know how to sell this. I'm not an art dealer.
I don't know. Sell it online.
you know, do some research, make some calls.
or is that too hard to do with your high blood pressure?
all right. Don't get snippy.
just because you write a great song doesn't mean you can draw.
it's incredible. John Lennon drew it.
I think it's a Ringo.
don't beat me up if I get $300 for it.
don't take anything less than $6, 500 for that.
it's very valuable. It's important to me.
I want you to sell it so I can help you.
okay.
all right. I'll see you at my party.
what should I bring? You want wine or something?
no, don't buy wine with my money and give it to me at my party.
that's mean.
I love you. - All right.
how do I call eBay?
I mean, he called me a bitch. What am I supposed to say?
but I think maybe that might mean he likes me.
I don't know. It's making me really... It's really awkward.
I think he might like you.
she's so cute. She's so tall.
I know.
how did that happen?
do you ever wish we had a bigger family?
no. Never for a second.
never.
never? - Never.
I love what we have.
one? A breeze.
two? Brutal.
three? Put a bullet in my head.
Ugh.
you know, I think about that gray-haired pregnant lady from school, and I just feel bad for her.
and I feel bad for the kid.
can you imagine?
all the other little kids, "Where's your mommy?
Oh, she's the one sitting in that scooter, eating a soft cracker.
kids don't want to have old parents.
you know what? It would also be nice for us to spend some time apart.
kind of rediscover who we are, individually.
it'd be so great to not see you for a chunk of time, so that I could really just miss you.
remember when we used to miss each other?
Hey! Hey, you.
Yeah, what's up?
Hey, I'm Sadie's mom.
Sadie?
Sadie, the one you chat with on the Internet.
no, man. That ain't me.
well, it was you. I saw your picture.
did you make a hot list? And not put Sadie on the hot list?
she was not on my list, no.
you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna make my own hot list.
and you know what? You're on the not-hot list.
how does that feel?
it doesn't bother me. I'm comfortable with the way I am.
maybe you shouldn't be so comfortable with yourself.
you know why?
you look like a miniature Tom Petty.
how's that feel?
you think that haircut's cool? It's not.
it looks like you put your Justin Bieber wig on backwards.
are you still comfortable with yourself?
why are you wearing a tank top? Huh?
so you can show off your little bald pits, you little hairless wonder?
cool tank top, man. Huh?
so next time you think about writing something nasty on my daughter's Facebook page, just remember me.
remember me.
I will come down here, and I will fuck you up.
okay, I'm sorry.
wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey!
wait. You're not... Are you crying?
just let me go.
Oh, my...
I'm sorry. - Okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm not in my right head.
I understand. My mom's going through menopause, too.
it's a hard time.
What'd you say?
are you going through menopause?
I'm not going through menopause.
I'm not gonna go through menopause for like 20 years.
I'm pregnant, you little bitch.
God damn it!
God damn it!
I'm going out with Desi to find out if she's stealing from us.
I've got the Graham Parker concert. Who's gonna watch the kids?
I don't know. Figure it out.
I kind of just wanted to talk.
I thought maybe we could go to a coffeehouse or something.
you want coffee? This place has coffee.
they have all kinds of drinks.
um...
but someplace quiet, maybe.
this place can be quiet.
there's a spot in the back. It's pretty quiet.
what sport do you guys play?
we play hockey.
Oh, I like hockey.
who do you guys play for?
we play for the Philadelphia Flyers.
so, you guys are all from Philadelphia?
no.
actually, none of us are.
do you guys still have all of your teeth?
well, I got all my teeth except these ones.
do you want to try them on?
Yeah, I'll do it. - Go for it.
do I look sexy?
Yeah!
do you want to make out with me?
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
they definitely look way better on her than they do on you.
here we go.
thank you.
so, should we go to the quiet area?
no, no, no.
where are you going?
we kind of have to have a little business meeting tonight.
business meeting?
girls, you gotta celebrate because we won tonight. Let's go.
I want to party with these winners. Come on, Deb.
just come to the stage and dance with us.
Yeah. - Okay.
Yeah!
okay, let's fucking dance!
Yeah!
don't be shy, feel free to come down and fill up these empty seats.
thank you so much for coming. This is so exciting!
for the first time in over 30 years,
Graham Parker & The Rumour.
where are his fans? I mean, where are they?
it's hard to watch a band when you know all of them remember D-Day.
what was the press turnout like?
Oh. You're serious?
nobody came. Nobody.
nobody is here?
the guy from Green Day is here.
Yeah, Billie Joe, I emailed him. He's a fan.
you gotta get a photo of the two of them.
no, he says he doesn't want to do any press.
he's just watching the show.
Oh, how punk-rock of him. "I don't like photographs."
grow up, Green Day!
shut the fuck up, Tom Selleck!
it's so good you did this.
Pete, I wanted to let you know that I got offered a job at Sony Records, and I think I'm gonna take it.
I used to work for Sony.
no, I know. They love you there.
who did you interview with? - John Cleary.
I hired John Cleary. - He hired me.
what do you know?
he only had lovely things to say about you.
no, he's a dick, and he's gonna fuck you too.
not if I do a really good job.
Really? I signed Pearl Jam.
you don't have, like...
I wouldn't call them classically good dance moves, but you left it all out there.
you're a blast to dance with.
thank you.
we're having a little shindig at the hotel after this.
you should come by and hang out at the hotel.
you want me to come to the hotel?
Yes, I want you to come by the hotel with me.
well, what would we do there?
maybe we can find somewhere quiet and have fun and kind of see where it goes.
do it like adults do sometimes and...
like, sex?
I mean, if you want.
if that's on the docket, but I'm not trying to force that.
so, you would do sex with me?
"do sex"?
what are you, Borat?
are you hitting on me?
Yes, yes, I'm hitting on you.
you're hot and cool and nice and you have beautiful eyes.
I'm sorry.
I'm married, I have two kids and I'm pregnant.
that is what we call the hat-trick.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
I was just really enjoying you being so nice to me.
I hope this doesn't come off as super-cheesy, but I think you're a very rare find.
thank you.
and I would totally "do sex" with you.
that was spectacular, guys.
really well done. Amazing.
thank you. - Good, good.
Hey, Graham.
Pete. How are you, man?
well, the first numbers came in.
Yeah, right, yeah.
happy? How's it looking?
about half of your last record.
Ah. So, you were expecting it to sell?
they never sell anymore. They used to sell, but now they don't.
I'm not a sexy 16-year-old girl.
but I wanted to sell it. It's such a good record.
I feel like I let you down.
no, I'm gonna be fine, man. My overheads are so low.
I just got a song in Glee.
the guy in the wheelchair is gonna sing it to the Asian girl, I believe.
I don't know, I've never seen the show, but that's what I'm told.
the secret is, make sure you have a small nut.
that's the key to life.
graham, I don't have small nuts, all right?
I have big nuts and I need to provide for them.
Graham! Hey, what's up?
Billie!
graham, how are you doing, man?
great fucking show, man. Good to see you.
thank you. - Fuck.
Yeah, I'm inspired.
I want to write a fucking song right now.
inspired. - Yeah.
that inspires me.
let's go get a drink. - Let's get a drink.
all right. You coming?
no, no, I'm fine. You guys go.
congratulations on Glee.
Oh! Yes, thank you.
all right. See you, Pete.
all right. So long, guys.
Yeah, yeah.
you got a song on Glee? - Yeah.
that's killer, man. That's so much money.
it's great. It's good for all of us.
why did you put that guy's teeth in your mouth?
that's so gross.
I was drunk. - He was dirty.
no, he was wearing a tie.
that's true. - He wasn't dirty.
when I kissed him, I felt his little tiny teeth nubs with my tongue.
you did? - Yeah.
it was like kissing a baby.
French-kissing a baby.
can I ask you something stupid? - Uh-huh.
do you know why we're missing money at the store?
are you guys missing money?
Yeah. Like, $12, 000.
do you think that I took it?
no. I mean... Well, no.
I did and I don't now.
it's not me.
why do you live in such a nice apartment and have such a fancy car?
Yes, you're right. Um... Look...
I am an escort.
I get paid to go out on dates.
you...
Oh.
but only three to five times a year.
ten times, max.
but it's not technically prostitution, because I don't have to sleep with them.
Oh, well, that's good.
but I always do.
that's why I only do it four to eight times a year.
fifteen times, max.
huh.
one year, I did it 20.
well, as long as you think it's safe.
it's safe.
I only do it 10 to 30 times a year.
so, who do you think is stealing money?
it's fucking Jodi.
no. - Yeah.
she's a pilled-out whore.
huh.
since you told me, I want to tell you something.
you're pregnant.
how'd you know?
Wow.
maybe you should tell Pete.
you didn't tell Pete yet?
I haven't told Pete.
Why? - I don't know why.
I just want him to want me.
I don't want him to want me because I'm pregnant.
go home and fucking suck his dick and tell him then, and he will love it.
you think? - He'll be so excited.
or even better yet... better yet, you should tell him while you're sucking his dick, like...
I'm pregnant.
what are you doing?
um, returning some emails.
what time do you have to go to work?
like, 10 minutes ago.
do you wanna be late?
no, I can't be late, not today.
do you see me standing here in front of you, half-naked?
Yeah.
and does that make you feel anything, or...
come on. Are you trying to start a fight?
no, I'm not trying to start a fight with you.
I'm trying to fuck you.
Oh, God, you know what?
today, of all days, is the day you need to cut me a break, all right?
whatever.
Oh, God.
what?
I didn't realize it was intentional.
I didn't say anything because I didn't want you to be embarrassed.
I thought I was being gallant.
all right, fine. I'm an asshole.
God.
you know what your problem is?
you're never, ever in the moment.
you're never, ever present. You're never in your body.
that's not true. I am in the moment. You know how I know?
I want to get the fuck out of the moment.
I swear, I can't win with you. I just can't do it.
you can't just walk away.
Oh, God.
Hey! How's the record company going, Pete?
what? Not great.
I'm still waiting for numbers to come in.
what have you heard?
a couple numbers have trickled in.
it's lower than we expected.
then why are you giving Larry money?
what?
I know everything. I talked to the accountant.
you know what? I don't wanna get into some nasty fight so can we please talk to each other the way the therapist told us to talk to each other?
fine. Fine.
it makes me feel sad when you are dishonest.
I understand it makes you feel bad when I am dishonest with you.
it hurts my feelings when you treat me with contempt and corner me, and try and trick me into lying.
okay.
it makes me sad when it's so easy to trick you into lying, because you're such a lying shit-bag.
that's not... You can't do that, you can't do that.
the therapist said you're not allowed to judge me.
that's not a judgment, that's just a fact.
fair enough.
sometimes I withhold truth, that is true.
but it's only because I'm scared to death of your crazy-assed, illogical overreactions.
well...
it hurts me inside and triggers me when you're such a dishonest shit, that you're lending your father money without telling me while your record company's going bankrupt and we're on the verge of losing our fucking house!
what else are you lying about?
I've taken Viagra for two years.
I ate six muffins downstairs a while ago and my cholesterol level is 305.
my heart could explode at any second.
these might be my very last words.
Oh, and I gave Charlotte antibiotics when you weren't looking.
that's why her ear got better. So, go fuck your witch doctor.
what are we even doing? What are we doing?
this is not making me happy. You're not happy.
you don't like me. I can feel that.
I'm not blind.
Jesus.
we're like business associates.
we're like brother and sister.
there's no passion there.
we're not like brother and sister. You know what we're like?
we're like Simon and Garfunkel and, somehow, you turned me into Garfunkel.
I don't even know what that means.
art Garfunkel.
what's wrong with Art Garfunkel? He has a beautiful voice.
he's got an amazing voice! He could put a harmony to anything!
but what I'm saying is that you turned me into him.
what the hell are you talking about?
Simon controls him!
that's because Simon writes the fucking songs!
he's the better one!
you know what? I see the way you look at our kids.
you have so much love and compassion for them.
you never look at me like that. Ever.
would we even still be together if I didn't get pregnant 14 years ago?
you know what? I'm not gonna go down that road.
would we?
okay.
you know what? I don't want to have a party here.
you need to cancel it.
no, I'm not.
I already paid for the catering. I've put down deposits.
and I sure as fuck am not gonna call everybody back in two days when you change your mind.
your girlfriend is not ugly.
actually, Larry, she's not my girlfriend. She's just a...
it's cool, buddy. You don't have to explain your girlfriend to me.
can you please stop licking your fingers?
do you know how many germs are on your hands?
and you're putting them into your mouth.
that's gross. Stop.
stop it!
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey! Sadie, enough, all right?
she isn't hurting anyone.
you want to say something, just keep your mouth shut.
you have never been nice to her and now she's getting aggressive with you.
I told you this would happen.
I'm sick of everybody fighting.
what do you think you're gonna be like when you grow up?
I don't know. Um...
I don't know.
do you think you want kids?
Mm-hmm. Just one.
just one, why?
because if I have two, then the other will fight with the other one.
does it make you sad when you fight?
Mm-hmm. I don't want anyone to fight.
I love you.
why isn't anybody talking? Why is it so quiet?
it's the Sounds of Silence.
will you stop, Dad?
how many of those are you gonna eat?
as many as I want.
I'm gonna tell Mom on you.
try it. See what you get for Christmas.
nothing.
snitches wind up in ditches.
remember that.
Hey, Peter.
Hi. - Hiya.
all right. See you.
have a good one.
Peter.
Peter!
Hi.
Catherine.
I'm Joseph's mother.
Oh, right. No, I know. Hi, Catherine.
our kids have gone to school together for eight years.
sorry.
Hello, Joseph.
I hear our kids have been chatting online.
yeah? I heard that your wife has been screaming at my son.
and I don't appreciate it. - Excuse me?
she screamed at my son.
right? She threatened you. She screamed at you. She cursed at him.
he's 13 years old, for God's sake.
what the hell is the matter with her?
okay, you better check her meds and get'em right.
okay, you know what? Why don't you back the fuck off?
because that's my lovely, sweet wife you're talking about.
Oh, I need to back off? - Yeah, you need to back off.
because your kid is an animal. He's a fucking animal.
why don't you put him on a leash?
turn around, turn around, turn around!
if he insults my daughter again,
I'm gonna hit him with my fucking car.
got it?
in fact, if you insult my wife again, you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna show up at your house when you're sleeping and I'll take your iPad or your iPod or your iMac and I'll shove them up your fucking iCunt.
I got nothing to lose. Your kid is the problem.
turn around. - My kid is a fucking angel.
I don't have time for this shit.
so I'm keeping it together, but if I wasn't at school right now...
touch my... Touch me?
I didn't touch your... - You touched my upper breast.
I didn't. I didn't. I got right below your shoulder.
you got right here. You actually... He hit my nipple.
you what?
you're insane.
why would you do that? - Did you just touch my mom's nipple?
he just touched my nipple. Why would you do that to me?
I poked you on the shoulder.
I have very high nipples.
I touched your shirt.
what do you think is under my shirt?
your shoulder. Your shoulder. - He just touched my breast.
well, that's a funny place to put a shoulder, on my boob.
Hello? There are children around.
this isn't over. This is not over. You're gonna be sorry.
let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
and why the fuck would you believe Desi?
you just admitted it.
did I?
you stole $12, 000 from me, Jodi, and I need you to pay me back.
could you at least give me a referral?
you babysat my kids while you were on OxyContin.
oxycodone.
well, oxycodone.
Oxycotton.
oxycontin?
Oxykitten.
what's Oxykitten?
meow.
Jodi, you put me in danger. Me and my family.
it was a cry for help.
help. Help.
why don't you help me?
why don't you help me? Just help.
just help.
you didn't help me.
are you high right now?
help me.
is that about me? Is that the cops?
is this a set-up?
I need to go.
okay, see you later.
fuck you, Debbie.
fuck you.
could you see it in your heart to lend me some money?
I would love to lend you money, but... - Thank you.
I mean, there's no way I could. - Why?
I just wouldn't wanna jeopardize a relationship with somebody that I care about by giving them money.
I mean, look how far we've come that you could come to me for advice and be able to ask me to borrow money.
let me ask you a question. Who do you like better Simon or Garfunkel?
Garfunkel. - Really? Garfunkel?
Yeah, he's got the voice of an angel.
he's got a great voice, but what about Simon? He wrote the songs.
who cares? Everybody writes songs. How many singers are there?
Simon's a good singer, too. - Art Garfunkel is a choir all in one man.
have you ever hear Paul Simon sing Bridge Over Troubled Water in concert by himself? It's a nightmare. It's like nails on a chalkboard.
is there a chance I'm just wrong about everything?
definitely. Of course. Absolutely.
joseph was very upset when I spoke to him about this.
so I thought it was important that we join together and work this through.
Absolutely.
we're gonna work through it, but Debbie told my son that he looked like Tom Petty, in a negative way.
who's Tom Petty? - You know who Tom Petty is.
and she said that if she had to come back that she was going to...
F"up his pussy-ass, which is what she said.
Oh, my...
are you serious?
I didn't. I would never. To a child?
your son has been defiling my daughter's Facebook page now for months.
these people are liars.
he said that my son was an animal and that if I didn't keep him on a leash, that he would hit him with his car.
did you say that?
that's ridiculous.
who talks like that? - You do.
he didn't say that. - He said it to me.
no. What I said was that we need to keep an extra eye on our kids because with all the technological advances, they need to learn to use them responsibly.
no. What he said to me was... He called me an iCunt.
a what? Language, Catherine! Language.
I'm quoting!
how am I gonna relay what these two nutballs said to me, unless I say it?
can you please not talk like that, Catherine?
music Man is rehearsing next door.
sorry, fucking Music Man.
maybe if I looked more like this fake bullshit couple.
looks like they're in a bank commercial.
that's what you look like.
like you're a bullshit bank commercial couple.
none of this talk is productive.
I would like to rear up and jackknife my legs and kick you both in the fucking jaw with my foot bone.
you're just really scaring me.
this is what happens when you corner a rat.
you corner me, I will fucking chew through you.
I'll chew through you.
Catherine, you're better than this.
fuck you, Jill. You're a horrible fucking woman.
this is why everybody hates you, Jill.
this kind of shit. Ineffective. Fucking bullshit hair.
and I'm glad your husband died.
because you're a fucking asshole. He probably killed himself.
okay, Catherine, I think we know what's happening now.
now you know what we're dealing with.
I'm not gonna eat that chicken.
why not?
because I feel like I'm gonna be a vegetarian.
can you become a vegetarian tomorrow? - Uh-uh.
you guys have been reading my texts?
no, we haven't. - Yes, we have.
we're supposed to keep an eye on you.
how did you find out?
joseph told me that you flipped out on him and his mom.
and you guys are nuts, and I agree.
all right, you know what? Don't be disrespectful.
you're the ones who are disrespectful.
reading my texts is like reading my diary.
and you were really sweet on your iChats.
we were really proud of you.
Yeah, we were going to give you your computer and phone back.
fuck you!
okay, there's the first official "fuck you."
okay, that is not how we talk to each other in this house.
you guys talk to each other like that all the time.
and to Joseph and his mom. You made Joseph cry.
joseph has a crush on you. You like a boy who cries.
shut up, Charlotte.
you guys so desperately want me to be so perfect and to make no mistakes.
well, you two are fucking insane.
okay.
all you do is fight, or you don't fight, which is even worse because it looks like you hate each other for weeks.
you obsess over every little thing I do, and you don't trust in me or believe in me.
well, I'm fucking sick of it.
Yeah, I said "fuck." Fuck, fuck, fuck.
ground me forever, I don't care. I don't care about anything.
I hate everything.
everyone's going crazy. I don't care if I have no friends.
are you still upset about Lost?
of course I'm upset about Lost!
you guys took away my shit before I could watch the last two episodes.
and I don't know what the fuck happened!
she's becoming just like us.
I hope I never get my period if this is what happens.
where did you find this?
I stole it.
thank you.
no big deal.
our kids are fucking crazy.
and it's our fault.
do you think there's anything we can do to turn it around, or...
Sadie's 13. She might be a lost cause.
where did she learn that kind of language?
we don't talk like that.
I have no fucking idea.
do you think Sadie is this crazy because of us or is it hormones and Lost?
J. J.Abrams.
he's ruining our daughter. - Yeah.
that fucking geek.
I feel bad for us. I feel bad for us.
all of a sudden, we're like a magnet for negativity.
why do people keep attacking us?
what did we do? We're just doing our best.
should we talk about our fight?
I think we're under enough pressure.
let's just let it go, this time.
Yeah.
we can give each other a break.
all right, great. Thank you.
and I'm sorry about my dad. You're right.
I'm sorry that he's just an endless mooch.
the truth is that this isn't about us.
it's about our parents.
we're not even mad at each other. We're mad at them.
exactly. Exactly.
let's just take away our parents' power by loving them.
can we do that?
Yes.
thank God.
I kind of feel better already, do you?
do you? - I do.
I love you. - I love you, too.
it's not us, it's them.
totally.
what are you doing? We have to get ready for the party.
I just watched the last episode of Lost.
okay.
you know what? We don't have time for this right now.
we have a lot of people coming over.
they're all dead.
what?
Jack, Kate, Sawyer...
I don't care about the show right now. - Jin, Sun...
okay? I need you to just get in the shower, get dressed.
let's just put it on hold. - Walt, Juliet...
all those people.
don't think about Lost today.
tomorrow, Lost, all day. I can't wait to hear about it.
Jack? No way, really? Right now, shower.
I don't make fun of your stupid Mad Men.
first of all, I don't get worked up over Mad Men.
that's because Mad Men sucks.
what Don Draper has gone through beats whatever Jack is running from on some fucking island.
bunch of people smoking in an office. It's stupid.
it's about a lot more than that. And you don't have any kind of understanding about what it was like in the 60s.
you do cry during Mad Men.
I don't cry over it. I appreciate it. - Right.
you're getting me off topic.
just, please, get dressed.
hello. - Hi.
I'm glad you're here.
I need a buffer in case it gets weird.
Oh, well, I'm ready to buff.
grab these napkins. - Let's buff. Okay.
so, that's the girl who works for you.
Yeah. That's her. Works for Debbie.
she seems nice.
my wife would never let me have a hot employee like that.
yeah? - No.
every woman who works for us looks like they've been in some kind of horrible accident.
I'm taking control, and now you're my slave.
are you comfortable with that around your husband?
Oh. Pete wouldn't know what to do with that.
do you think our wives are looking at us right now?
Oh, definitely. - Yeah.
they look like pedophiles.
thank you. - The girls are so excited you're here.
they're all outside.
Hi. - Hi.
Hey, how are you? - How are you, man?
good to see you.
happy birthday, Pete.
how wonderful to see you.
thank you, Grandma Molly.
you're wonderful.
and look at my gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.
no, I get that. I'm just wondering why I should do it.
Pete, Jason's here.
Peter, hi.
Hey, how's it going, Jason?
you look well. - Thank you.
how do you like what I've been doing to your girl?
how do you like Debbie's "after" body?
it's nice. - Come on. Show him.
look at this. It's beautiful.
look at that "after" ass. Now, it starts here.
but it used to start here.
and I brought it up.
you're welcome.
so, are you a trainer?
Yes. - Oh.
but not just physical. Spiritual. I'm sort of a guide.
Mm-hmm. You guys should talk. I think you'll get along.
come here, honey. I gotta tell you something.
Yeah.
who's that in the pool? - Mine.
hello. - Hello, Debbie.
how are you? - Good.
remember my husband, Pete?
Oh, right. I didn't recognize you with the long hair.
Oh, yeah. I've been growing it.
happy birthday.
thank you so much.
very old Scotch.
Wow. You know...
I hope it hasn't expired.
no, Scotch doesn't expire.
it improves with age.
Yeah. No, I know. Thank you so...
that's nice. Come on in. - Sure.
sorry.
so, what do you do in Chino, Oliver?
I'm a surgeon.
Wow. What kind? - That's great.
mainly of the spine.
my specialty is scoliosis surgery.
my mom used to talk to me like I had scoliosis because I'm a little hunchy, but that's a different thing.
well, you definitely don't look right.
Hey! - Hey!
sorry we're late.
I was in the lab, cloning myself.
we're gonna have another seven tomorrow.
we cut their hair differently, so we can finally tell who they are.
you like the new haircut, Travis?
I'm Jack, damn it!
Oh. Of course.
Larry, this is my father.
Really? How are you?
Oliver. - Oliver?
can I have some more?
please, Oliver? I need a little more, sir.
I love that movie. You must get that all the time.
not really. - My nose itches right here.
I'm sorry, excuse me. I'm Claire and I'm Larry's wife.
very nice to see you, but I'm gonna go get the kids.
we won't see her now for the whole day.
I'd help, honey, but you know I got the blood pressure, and I don't want to.
can I get you a drink, Dad?
Yeah, a little white wine.
white wine? - Yeah.
heavy stuff. - Yeah.
so, who knew that Debbie had a dad?
where have you been for 15 years?
never seen you at Hanukah or Christmas or Ramadan, nothing.
how do you get out of all that stuff? Do you have a wife?
Yeah, my wife's at home.
why didn't she come?
uh, construction. They're sanding our deck.
you let the woman sand the deck?
she supervises it. Yes.
okay.
Hey, guys.
Hey! Look how big the kids are!
Sadie!
Hi, Larry. - Hi, Sadie.
mom. Who's Oliver?
what do you mean?
is he your dad?
is he my... He's my biological father.
what does that mean?
it means that my mom, Grandma...
he and my mom had a baby, and that was me.
Oh, so you're our grandpa?
well, why don't you ask your mother?
Yeah. I guess so.
then that would make him your grandfather then, yes.
do you want him to be?
Yes, then we get another grandpa.
come on.
well...
another grandpa. - Trampoline time.
that was deeply uncomfortable.
at least that pretty girl was here to divert our attention.
Oh, my gosh. Hi.
me, oh, my. I did not see you there.
Hi. - I saw you there.
did you guys come together? Are you a couple?
no, we didn't come together. - No, absolutely not.
I'm sorry, I thought... The moustache is a little...
Mmm. That's fair. - I just assumed.
this is a straight-man moustache.
what is the difference between a gay man's moustache and a straight man's moustache?
the smell.
uh, excuse me.
so, spinal surgery.
it just seems to me to be at the top of the surgery chain.
well, we're not cardio, we're not neuro, but I like to think we're an important part of the spectrum.
do you operate every single day? - Most days.
multiple times a day?
three, four times.
so, what's the price range? Like, if I wanted a...
I'd rather not say.
it's so big, you're embarrassed to say.
I wouldn't say "embarrassed.
are there hunchbacks today? - Of course.
I've never seen one.
well, that's because there are spinal surgeons.
that's because of you.
each time I don't see a hunchback, you're getting that much richer.
you like The Beatles, don't you?
who doesn't like The Beatles? - Nobody.
no, nobody.
so funny. You're so funny.
what is your sun sign?
Libra. - Oh, boy.
that's not good. - No, sir.
that's not good. Not for me, that's not good.
sexually, we're completely incompatible.
that's not true. - Right?
that's such a shame.
Yeah, it's as bad as it gets.
you don't know. - What is yours?
I'm a Cancer.
Really? - Is that good?
Wow. - What does it mean?
that's kind of strange. Well...
taurus and Cancers are, sort of, soul mates of the Zodiac.
we're, like, perfectly compatible.
and I balance what you lack and you make up for what I lack.
and a quiet Cancer almost always has a huge penis.
you're making me embarrassed. Thank you.
thank you.
no. Fantastic.
Oh, I wanted to make a toast.
thank you guys for coming. Thank you so much.
Pete's turning 40.
weird.
and we're ready to start this new phase of our lives with open hearts.
ready to just choose joy and forgive everybody.
so, thank you all for coming.
wait. Forgive who?
I think she just means in a general sense.
you know, just put the past behind us...
and live without resentment.
but, specifically, who are you forgiving?
I just like to know the details before I make a toast.
right. You and my dad and, you know, others.
I see.
well, I know you have some issues with me, but I'm curious, what's he in for?
before today, nobody even knew he existed.
well, my parents divorced when I was really young and we don't spend much time together and I'd like to work on that.
just like we would like to work on how you have financial issues.
she's talking about all the lending and the borrowing and...
I know what she meant.
you are a beautiful woman, but you are not totally maxed out.
I would say, honestly, you're a six.
Oh. A six-and-a-half.
I could make you an 11. - Really?
when I found Deb, she was a 7.
and now she's a 12.
I wanna be a 12.
you can't be lazy. - I don't wanna be lazy.
look at me. You cannot be lazy.
I won't be lazy.
do you know how she got her body? - How?
bodies by Jason. - Wow.
say it. - Bodies by Jason.
say it again. - Bodies by Jason.
and now just say, "Jason" - Jason.
again. - Jason.
that sounds right, doesn't it?
Yeah.
what the fuck is happening right now?
when was the last time you two saw each other? I'm curious.
actually, we had lunch together last week. - Uh-huh.
and before that?
it's been about seven years.
seven years? That's a joke, right?
that's like two Olympics.
but I'm the bad guy.
all right, Dad.
what Debbie doesn't understand is it's not bad to help out a parent.
and it's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child.
I'm sure Oliver would agree. - Well...
are you really doing this right now?
am I doing what? I didn't start the toast.
are you really about to hit up my dad for money?
what? He does four operations a day.
it's perfect. It helps everybody and it relieves his guilt from all the abandonment issues.
you can't buy forgiveness. Right, Pete?
I don't think anyone is looking for handouts. I mean, you know...
we'd pay him back.
if you two are in a bind, I'd be more than happy to help.
no. It's not good to borrow money from family members because it causes resentment. Remember?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
what do you want me to do? Okay. Admit that my life is shit?
is that what you want me to say? You happy?
aren't I allowed a little joy with these children I never wanted to have?
you have never once stopped asking us for money.
family helps family.
it's true. Family helps family.
look, I don't expect you to fully understand.
your dad left. You're broken inside.
it's not your fault you can't feel love.
there's something that you can't...
this is coming out wrong.
you know what? I would rather have my dad than your dad.
because he doesn't drive me crazy.
you know what's the best quality my father has?
is he asks for nothing.
I don't know what the fuck he's thinking right now.
look at that. Nothing. Nothing.
I don't even know him.
and I turned out perfectly fine without his input, okay?
I just figured out what your problem is.
you hate Jews.
which is so odd because your children are Jewish.
don't play the Jew card, Larry.
I'm not playing any Jew card. - Seriously, it's used up.
you can't use up a Jew card. That's the whole point of a Jew card.
that's right. You can't use it up, it goes forever.
you know what? I have to go.
Yeah, great. What a big surprise.
Bye, Oliver. See you later. See you in another seven years.
make sure and say goodbye to the grandkids who you met today.
you know, nothing I do is right because of you.
nothing. No matter how hard I try, I'm just the asshole here.
but you know what? You know what I realized?
it's you. You're the asshole.
good luck working that out.
happy birthday, and go fuck yourself.
Hey, see you when the Cubs win the pennant.
I'm gonna go light the candles. Just get it going, okay?
maybe we should try the toast again. - You know, can you be quiet?
you just threw me under the bus.
no, I don't... - You threw me under the...
you threw me under the bus.
we agreed to let go and forgive, but then you started ripping into my dad like a crazy person.
I'm not ripping into your dad.
I'm just saying to him what you say to me.
don't be such a ball-buster.
I am not a ball-buster. You make me one.
I am a fun girl. I am fun-loving.
I am a "Good-Time Sally." I dance hip-hop.
I cannot believe I have wasted my whole life busting the balls of people who have no balls.
I'm the only one here who has any balls!
God damn it.
mom?
mom? What are you doing?
what?
you're smoking, and in the front yard?
No! No, they're Barb's.
mom!
since when have you been a smoker?
I'm not a smoker.
I thought you said smokers die.
I'm not smoking. I wasn't smoking.
I saw you.
no, I wasn't.
mom, you're smoking?
Deb, you can't smoke, you're pregnant. You've been doing so well.
you're pregnant?
no effing way. I don't want another sister.
I don't want her as a sister.
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. It just slipped out.
are you pregnant? Since when are you pregnant?
since when do you care? You don't even want another baby.
you have no idea what I want.
I want an Asian baby.
we're not gonna have an Asian baby.
Yes, We are.
they're not Asian. - Sadie.
we'll buy one. - Shut up, Charlotte.
you shut up. - Shut up, Sadie!
shut up, Charlotte! - Shut up!
okay, Sadie, shut up. - Shut up, Charlotte!
shut up! - Okay, stop saying "shut up"!
you're pregnant? Since when are you pregnant?
when did you find out?
will you stop eating cupcakes, please?
stop eating cupcakes! Stop eating cupcakes!
Hey, we just heard. You're having a baby?
see, it can happen to anybody.
that is so wonderful.
let me give you a hug. Fantastic, congratulations.
it's wonderful. I'm so happy for you.
this is too adult for you. Let's go outside.
Congratulations.
well, I guess we're stuck together then forever then, right?
weren't we always?
you didn't even want a baby.
of course I do. I never said that.
I didn't want one if I could choose.
I should put that on a Hallmark card. That's beautiful.
Debbie...
good luck with the pregnancy, Debbie.
but please, take care of yourself.
it's a much riskier pregnancy after 40.
I'm not 40. - Of course you are.
you were born on December 5th, 1972.
I'm not 40. How do you know?
I was there. I'm the one who took your mother to the hospital.
well, that's not what she said.
your mother was in labor for only about 20 minutes.
you couldn't wait to meet me. Can you imagine that?
I don't even know you.
you can't just come into my house and reminisce.
look, maybe we're just not meant to be in each other's lives.
I'm not sure this was such a great idea.
wait a minute. Hey, wait a minute!
you did leave and you didn't come back.
my first life was ruined. I did my best with my second.
so, I ruined your life? I was eight.
people do better when I stay out of their lives!
that's what my son tells me.
you think my life is so perfect?
I've got a 13-year-old who's a pothead.
I've got a wife who's keeping Zoloft alive.
you never said that before.
you don't think I wanna talk to you about this, to share it with you?
it's just not our way. We don't talk to each other.
we don't know each other. And I thought that's the way you wanted it.
how do I get out of this?
how do I get you all to just help me down off the cross?
you sound just like Sadie.
who's Sadie?
no, your daughter. Your younger?
the big one.
your older. I know, I know that. A wonderful girl.
Hey, guys, some of us need to leave.
would this be a good moment to sneak out?
where is Dad going?
best birthday ever!
Oh, shit!
bike lane, asshole!
fuck you, you Twilight pimply-ass motherfuckers!
your dad's still here.
I know. It's kind of weird.
where the hell is Pete?
um...
is it okay if Joseph hangs out here for a while?
Mm-hmm.
Hi, Joseph.
Hi.
do you want a piece of cake?
Oh! Yeah, sure. Thank you.
all right, then.
they are so cute.
so cute.
he looks exactly like Tom Petty.
go around.
watch it, watch it!
Hey, Pete! Great party!
Yeah.
the best!
you shake it, and then a restaurant comes up.
dad, excuse me. I'm gonna go look for Pete right now.
would you mind staying with the girls for just a little bit?
well, if you want me to.
if you don't mind. You don't have to.
sure.
can I let Sadie show me the last episode of Lost?
she asked me if I'd seen it and I haven't.
Yeah, that would be nice.
thank you. - Thank you.
she said we could watch it. Come on.
I'm gonna let you watch Lost. Come on.
is it scary?
I'll cover your eyes if it gets too scary.
are you mad at me? Did I say something?
Shh. Larry, please.
are you fucking kidding me?
are you fucking kidding me?
you opened your door on me.
I didn't open my fucking door on you. I opened my door!
Aw, fuck. I was right there!
you're supposed to look before you open your door!
I was in a fucking bike path!
that's a blind spot. There's no fucking bike path.
it's a residential section. Get your head out of your ass.
pay attention!
open your goddamn eyes. What are you doing, sleepwalking?
you're supposed to look to see if a biker's coming through.
you're supposed to look!
it's not my job to look out for you. You look out for yourself.
I don't look out for you. I don't see you.
I don't know where the fuck you are or what you're doing.
no one is ever looking out for me!
I need your name and your number.
Why?
because you're gonna pay for my door.
fuck you!
why don't you pay for my bike and my face, you fucking prick?
don't disrespect me.
are you sure that's him?
I don't think that's him.
I gotta write down your license plate.
range Rover of Sunland.
what are you doing? - Ow.
I guess the party didn't turn out like you planned.
it wasn't a good party.
Hi. - Hi.
I'll bring you in as soon as his X-rays are finished.
okay. - Okay. Is he okay?
Yeah, he has a broken rib and he's been crying a little bit.
but he'll be fine.
you know, Pete was never a real fighter.
but that's why he married you. That's why he loves you.
because you're the fighter.
and you need that.
one person in a relationship has got to punch.
do you mean that in a good way?
Oh, it's a high compliment.
Thanks.
listen, I know what you're worried about.
you think he's gonna turn into me, but I don't think it's gonna happen.
he's smarter and probably a little cuter.
a little less Jew-y.
although after 50, that's all gonna change.
be prepared to wake up one day with a rabbi.
but the good news is, you know, he'll love you forever.
that's in our DNA.
we stick around.
he worries about you, you know.
it puts a lot of pressure on him.
I know, I just don't have anyone else to talk to about it.
why don't you talk to Claire?
if I open up to her, she'll leave me.
no, she won't.
Mmm. Larry, she loves you.
I know, but there's a certain point at which you just can't stay.
I guess it's hard to forgive somebody if they don't formally apologize to you.
are you apologizing?
I'm very close.
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm glad everybody's okay.
okay, thanks.
Oh, thank you.
all right, I'm off.
okay.
this is awkward.
what?
I need $40 for a cab.
that's funny.
no, I'm not kidding.
Oh, yeah.
you drove me, honey. I wasn't prepared.
I know. I only have a hundred.
it's okay.
I'll bring you the change.
all right. Give him a kiss for me.
I don't get it.
see, it's not sad.
it's happy, because they helped each other achieve their destiny.
great. I'm gonna have some freaky-ass nightmares.
Hi. - Hi.
I really liked our life so much better before we tried to change everything.
I'm sorry.
no, I'm sorry. I don't want to keep anything from you.
I love you, you're my wife.
I just didn't want to let you down.
are you mad that I'm pregnant?
no. I'm not mad, I'm thrilled.
you don't feel trapped?
I sometimes feel like I trapped you.
I don't feel trapped.
Really? - No.
you should, because I have trapped you.
you can't go anywhere.
I'm gonna get you pregnant every 10 years for the rest of your life.
you can never leave me. Ever.
I never feel trapped by you.
I'm so happy to be with you and I love you so much.
you're my favorite person in the whole world.
God damn it, why am I crying like this?
something is wrong with me.
you're pregnant.
Oh, yeah.
shit.
I was just outside telling your dad that I liked him.
what if he thinks I like him now?
no, he won't think that.
I don't want him to think I like him that much.
no, it will never happen.
can you believe it? This is the craziest thing ever.
what are we gonna do with a third baby?
I have no idea. How are we going to afford it?
we'll sell the house.
we don't have to.
we kind of do. - We kind of do.
we'll make new memories in a new house.
I love you.
is there anything you want to do for your birthday?
it's been the worst birthday ever.
there is one thing, but I don't think you'll like it.
what?
I wouldn't mind going to see some music. Would you want to do that?
Yeah.
Really? - Yeah.
I don't believe you, but you're sweet for saying that.
how do we break you out of here?
I can just leave on my own volition. It's not a mental institution.
can you? - Yes.
it's not like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
please don't put a pillow over my face.
let's get outta here, McMurphy.
you got it, Chief.
will you carry me?
you've been carrying me all this time.
Thanks.
I like this song.
Really?
Why?
why don't you sign him?
Ryan Adams? No, he wouldn't sign with me.
why not? You're the best.
he is in between labels.
let's go try and talk to him after the show.
thank you.
I'm sorry if I'm not all fancy pants and wealthy and showing it all off with my Vidal Sassoon haircuts.
sorry.
quit slow-blinking at me.
I'm sorry. Okay...
I would like to rear up and jackknife my legs and kick you both in the fucking jaw with my foot bone.
that's what I would fucking love.
I wish my fucking foot would go right through your skull.
this is what happens when you corner a rat.
I will fucking kill you.
you corner me, I will fucking chew through you.
I'll chew through you!
slow-blinking eyes. I will chew off your fucking eyelids.
you won't slow-blink at me, will you?
did you drink before you came here?
no, but I'm gonna start drinking.
I'm gonna slit somebody open like a fish and drink their blood.
that's what I'm gonna drink if we don't start getting to the fucking point here.
probably I'm gonna start with Karen Carpenter's head.
I'm gonna rip her head off and I'm gonna drink her blood.
and then I'm gonna come back and light you on fire.
I'm gonna light you all on fire.
but I'm gonna start with you, Jill.
I'm gonna fucking torch you.
you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go buy a fucking pickup truck.
and a cord of rope.
and I'm gonna string it around all three of your fucking necks and then drive around town, dragging you.
that's what I'm gonna fucking do.
that's completely uncalled for.
really, Jill? Do you think it is?
fuck off, Jill. God, everybody fucking hates you.
God!
that isn't even nice.
go suck a big fucking dick, Jill.
that's totally uncalled for, Catherine.
you're a fucking asshole. Everybody hates you.
they hate your fucking bob.
and I'm glad your husband died.
because you're a fucking asshole. He probably killed himself.
I would. Kill myself.
God, I'd kill myself, Jill.
cut!
CAFFREY: At this moment, there are people among you who are nolonge human.
their DNA has been infected by an alien intelligence.
they are stronger...
more rilient...

Mrs. Polchek is like a rail.

it could he been. And I told her that
I say going to call the ps, and then she grabbed her stupid little dog, and e went o to her limo and she ok off.
I want to press charges.
that's not my area.
this woman assaulted me!
I understand you're upset. Oh, I get it.
you Feds came down here because she's rich, right?
please excuse me.
Yeah, whatever.
our agents are tracking down Christe Polchek, but we m have another situation.

let's go.
okay.
we've got to send Fenway for the tation.
woman just threw a human head
three differtent women ssibly infected
all within a five-mile.
we have an outbreak.
damn.
tactical team already this area secured.
if this woman is an aen infected, we've got to protect them.
they're in mid-situation.

that's a tr.

should I
the second wife of billiaire l mogul Ken Polchek.
as in one of the president's closest fries.
and he's on the short list first Secretary of institution.
she's got millions of dollars at her disposal.
we've got to move fast.
infectees all want to spread e infection.
would they do that with money?
I don't want to find out.
what?
they've chosen a new national security staff
they didn't waste any time.
our new boss?
former senator from Concticut? Yeah.
I've presentation him this morning on Teshold, gave him security clearance.
come on.
Susan Medrano, 39
ligation attorney, single lived in Silver Spring.
imploded the corner of 19th and H in broad daylight.
mixed-media arti.
works out of her home in Georgetown.
about two hours ago, she removed her husband's head wither bare hands.
then have Christine Polchek, 32. Wow.
lives in Potom with h billionaire husband.
this morning, she punched through a bulletproof window at a bank in Adams Morgan, tacked a teller and sent a security guard to intensive care.
we need to find the common dominator among these threse emingly unrelated women.
our initial digging indicates that these three women haven't crossed paths recently...
Dr. Fenway,
I need you to examine Libby and her dead husband.
the one who explode on the street, test edositive aliemutation.
I could have old you that just by looking at her.
Susan and Libby homes, see if you can find a link.
and take Lucasith you.
hack into their computers. You got it.
I'm the software genius.
that's why I need you toel J. T. figure out ere Christine' moving her money.
did into her financials, see where it going.
good luck.
Hey, Molly, can I talk to you or a second?
sure. What's up?
I saw Christine Polchek a dream last nigh
what kind of dream?
the glass forest kind.
okay.
not much too it, really.
I'd just like to know, uh, why me?
you've been exposed to the signal, and infectees use the dreams to communicate.
she was reaching out to you.
Oh, she was reach out all right.
dare I ask what you two were doing?
dancing.
then she tried to strangle me.
did she say anything?
no.
let me know if you have any more.
RAMSEY: Christine Polchek and her husband are loaded.
$9, 000 wire traners every two day in the past two weeks.
where to?
to Cayman Brac Bank & Trust.
Oh, private bank on the Cayn Islands.
can you hack io e receiving account.
damn, they're using Impervious.
what's that?
its a state--the-start security software.
that's just become your number one priority.
she could be funding some kind of alien plot with those extra-terrestrial.
I know exactly what you'd do
on line gambling.
you've racked up a pretty heavy deb on Threshold's dime.
please, I'm not violating any of your holy protocols.
I gamble at different websitesing different screen names.
rationalization is an addict's best fend.
than, Montel.
consider it my therapy bill.
smart ll on the Hasidic bulance.
how's that?
her face was completely deformed.
cops might n have believed my cover story if they'd seen she was Chinese.
has she said anything since she woke up?
not to me.
I saw your studio.
I want to know about the forest you built.
she's about as cooperative as the other five infectees downstairs.
we'll have continue getting r information medically.
you okay?
No!
I miss NASA.
I've located Christine Polchek.
she's got a four-man security dail.
l right. Uh, stay close, but don't approach.
let's not attact attention.
Roger that.
Dr. Caffrey.
it's a please to finally meet you.
Mr. Whitaker,
I was going to arrange to co see you.
no, I wanted to come down here inspection.
congratulations on you appointment, ir.
Yeah,it's bittersweet f me.
I'm sorry you had to give the order to bring her plane down.
she was infected by t alien signal.
you did the right thing.
so, uh, at are you working on now?
uh, outbreak here in D. C.
the women one dead om a mutation gonerong.
one in custody.
we're tracking down the this.
you let me know if you need any help.
I haven't able to read through the entire plan yet.
once I do,
I'll cl you with any thoughts.
thoughts?
my background is strategi planning and development.
there was enough left in there token vial
she's fected.
buit's worse than hat.
how far along is Libby's pregnancy?
according her HCG levels, between five and seven wee.
maybe she didn't even know.
possibly.
found something else intersting.
Thautopsy report on Libby's husband.
was he infected?
no.
nor s he the father of her baby.
how can you know with running a DNA test on the fetus?
he was impossibility.
according to the autopsy report, he had morphologic evidence of asospermia.
in English.
no sperm.
most likely caused by mumps as a child.
so what? Maybe Libby waving an affair, her husband found out, and that's what started their argument this morning.
with my first wife, all it took was not putting the toilet seat down.
no change, even when I metion the baby.
Anthe's no way of know if the fetus is infected?
no, it's too soon.
Amnios can be done as early as 15 weeks and we're still two months out.
say it.
if the child is infected by an infected person, the study of the fetus can make us fully understand that this species can save the lives of those who may be killed in the future.
let's discuss this after you're able to get the amnion results.
make sure she's comfortable and has what she needs to stay healthy.
Absolutely.
stay away from my baby!
don't touch my baby!
will kill you all I swear!
is that safe?
Yeah, it's naloxone.
it's a category "B sedative.
no harm the fetus.
well, one thing's for sure, she knows she's pregnant
question is: With what?
is that the stuff from the exploded woman's apartment?
Yeah.
can you get it all back before her parents fly in?
Yeah, I've done is a couple of times.
a hell of a lot of medical bills.
you find anything her computer?
nothing ou of the ordinary.
she did some pro bono work for Greenpeace.
also, for e past nine months she subscribed to MateFde. org.
it's an online dating service.
but she canceled the subscription three weeks ago.
maybe e found a guy.
Yeah, an infected one.
I've arranged a meeting for us with Polchek.
if Christine is infected, we have to assume he could be, too.
which means he'd be able to see you've been exposed to the signal.
maybe I should go alone.
it could also work it favor.
well, is great see you
this is Dr. Molly Carey.
she is working with us on a couple of special projects.
it's nice to meet you, Dr. Caffrey.
you, too, sir.
so what can I do for you today?
this is a t delicate, n.
as you know, the IRS monitors suspicious financial transactions;
repetitive and consistent withdrawals that fly under the $10, 000 radar.
what's that got to do with me?
your account was flagged by a daily Suspicious Activity Report.
your wife has be wiring money to an offense account $9, 000 increments.
are we breaking any laws
no, but it doesn't look good.
this account is linked to a classified investigation we're following.
it's not seem to poke around in my personal business.
we know you froze the account.
if you like, we can bring Christine in and talk to her.
if you have a problem, call my lawyer
we're done ere.
I had one of our agents take his cigar tub out of h car downstairs.
great. DNA.
to think in th'50s, we were afraid of little green men.
CAFFREY: Okay.
Polchek's DNA came tack normal.
so why stonewall u
we walked into his office and told him we knew his wife is stealing his momey.
probably assumes Christins having an affair.
and what good is a trophy wife if she's cheating on you?
so he closes ranks to save .
any idea on how we apprehend her?
if the bank teller press charges, then even Polchek won't be able to keep Cristine from being booked.
he can't control what happens in a police station.
wean.
I've decided to let it go.
um, Mrs. Pchek is an important customer.
we just d disagreement that's all.
I think I y have been little rude to her.
she grabbed your arm and tried to pull you through a window.
look, my lawyer said this is my business.
I have to get to work.
Polcheks bought themselves out of that fast.
cheated the bank teller for his own benefit?
when Chrtine hit her, she hit the lottery.
what's next?
keep tabs on Christine until we find out how these three women are connected.
PEGG: Check this out.
three $9, 000 transfers o their past bk statement.
that's the same amount Christine Polchek moved.
Yeah, and wired to the same Cayman Iand account.
it's an invoice Froodley Park Medical Group.
Susan had it also from the same place.
Really? -hmm.
let's see if they have a website.
a brick wall.
please, I'm just getting started.
all right.
I've done this before.
here we go.
the web address for the clinic's accounting section.
Oh, nice.
I'm in.
what are you doing?
it should give us some clues to what they do there.
FSH, clomiphene, h.
what are those?
fertility drug
it looks like Woodley Park Medical Group a fertility clinic.
that makes sense.
Libby's pregnant.
right, and you said Susa was a patient there also.
we found our link between the two.
how can I help?
CAVENNAUGH: We need some information on your patient, Libby Drennan.
I just saw her last weeks she okay?
our test show her is originated from the sperm you used tonseminate her.
well, that's not possible.
our donation program follows strict federal guides.
we've never had a problem with a donation sperm.
until now.
you have our full cooperation.
here it is
used donor number 356-H4.
pu every sperm vial corresponding to this ID.
here we go.
Medro, Susan-- inseminated two days ago.
Yeah.
inseminated as well.
damn.
what?
Christine Polchek-- so inseminated two and a half weeksgo.
they all used the same sample.
we just found an her secondary means of infection.
sexual transmission.
I checked today's schedule.
we've got a client who's being inseminated by the same donor Libby used.
when's it scheduled?
no
they're in room three.
got it.
federal agents.
stop the procedure.
what t hell's going on?
the prelim blood test showed that both doctors
and the patient?
well, a little freaked out, but also negative.
we u a double-cod system to inset donor anonymity, and I have to backtrack through two databases.
here we go.
ID number 356-H4 belongs to...
who?
one of our missing crewmen.
how did Sanford become a don here?
he was recruited five years ago when he s a student at Georgetown.
he had a pristine medical history, a high motile sperm count, above average IQ, and an outstanding physical quality
he was very popular donor.
when did he rejoin the program?
about a nth ago.
all his genetic disorder tests came back negative, so I put him back to rotation.
there were takers right away.
excuse me.
so Sanfor donates his sperm, waits for takers.
Yeah.
I mean, we know the infectees use their human expertise to further the alien agenda.
but how does he know which women used his sample?
he could he tapped to their phone lines, hacked into their computer system.
okay, so once knows o they are he contacts them.
welcomes the into the fold, starts taking donations.
targeting women with the means to afford fertility treatments.
you got to admit, that's pretty smart.
why didn't the tested DN show up when the fertility clinic tested Sanford's sample?
sperm can be tested for millions of things, from Tay-Shs to gonorrhea, but you can't test for what you d' to know exists.
this mutation is a tricky beast.
the test I created is the on one that can measure it.
we need to figure out a way to alert the medical community.
without blowing our scare.
exactly.
what's up?
Christine Polchek's hosting a charity funding for veGlobal
promoting more advanced world community.
J. T. you want a date?
it's soda water...
any sign of Christine?
not yet.
sir.
well, this is the last place I'd expect to find you.
we don't officially know each other, sir.
maybe I could ask this beautiful stranger to dance, then, hmm?
hm My pleasure.
any luck rounding up that infectee?
we're doing it right now.
are you serious? The Vice President's here.
I'm aware of that.
so who is it?
our hostess, Chrtine Polchek.
you're telling me that the wife of one of the Preside's closest friends is an alien?
Yes.
so what are you going to do?
wait until she moves to a conned space, Mm-hmm.
stun her, say she slipped and hit her head.
there's an ambulance sitting by to take her to Thresld.
all right, but you cannot make scene.
your plan clear states that a these operations
I am trusting you, Dr. Caffrey.
thank you.
it great to see so many people giving to a worthy cause?
Mrs. Polch.
you look different in person.
let's dance.
ed, well, I hear congratulations are in order.
Oh, well congratulations or condoles.
why not dance with your husband?
listen, if you t a moment, there's something I'd like to discuss think your company could help this administration with.
anything help the President.
can you feel our connection, Sean?
we've both changed.
I haven't changed.
Yes, you have.
so have some on your friend.
you don' t know what you're doing, Mrs. Polchek.
we can help u.
We'rethe one who doesn't will know what you're doing.
until this happened, we are spent shopping and going to spas.
this is the first time in my life i had a purpose
and what's that?
saving humanity.
see you in your dreams.
I've got her.
Mr. Polchek's looking for you.
Christine: One more second.
my husband, so protective of me.
you sure these figures are right?
Robert: Based on the bank statements you gave me, yeah.
uh... just checking.
so you went to MIT, right?
go Beavers.
Hey, somebody have to go to the second-rate school.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, who kicked your ass in the in chess competition two out of the last three years?
Oh, soy, I can't help it if we spend all our time with our own nuclear rector doing real science instead of playing on the web.
want a coffee?
eh, what the hell.
make it half-caff.
you want a coffee?
leave me alone.
what's your problem?
he had the nerve to slap my hand about my online gambling.
like I don't give a pint of blood to this place every week.
maybe he does have a poi.
does lapping up everything your bosses hand you make it easier?
I don't know.
does being a pain in the ass make it any easier?
Yes.
look, this program you wrote to hack into the Cayn Islands account, it could still take months to crack through the security system.
no, I found a back door. Where?
I opened up an account there.
once I was in the system, executed a Trojan Horse program.
not bad.
hold on.
and we're in.
candy from a baby.
the me other receiving account is Alleneeks.
but that not your real name.
aka Crewman Sanford, I bet.
Ah, this use thumbprints for identation pops.
compare it with the missing crewmen.
Yep, a match.
sanford its.
RAMSEY: Cavennghent to the address that Sanford gave at the clinic and it was already cleaned out.
PEGG: Look, he's emptied out the Cayman account.
over half a million dollars.
what is Sanford dog with that money?
probably not online gambling.
are we back to that?
well...
Oh, my God.
BAYLOCK: She's not in the city, not in the Northeast.
there's Christine.
nice move on the dance floor.
this morning, she boarded her husband's G5.
the pilot filed a flight plan to Aspen.
Cavennaugh's tracking device proves he walking.
the Polcheks have a home in Tulum, Mexico.
looks like that's where she's going.
do we think she's pregnant?
no. The clinic's rector said that Christine was inseminated two and a half weeks ago.
another predict for next month.
which means she isn't.
CAFFY: But she was infected by Sanrd's sperm.
Fenwai said all it takes is a tissue tear somewhere and e sperm n contaminate the bloodstream.
and now she's fully mutated and on t loose.
we can't Bigfoot Mexican authoritie like we do here.
Yeah, but she is out of the limelight.
Tulum's remote.
we can capture her there without awing attention.
Hey, I came across something really unusual
according to the clinic's records
Libby was inseminated three weeks ago.
you said the gestational age is between five and seven weeks.
well, that didn't really bother me that much.
it's not a pinpoint test.
but I did an ultrasound pile she s out.
organ development's complete.
the fetus measures 12. 5 centimeters.
it's even sucking its tub.
developments like this occur at5 weeks.
Libby's have an acelerated pregnancy.
she could have his baby within the month.
this may be the first alien born on Earth.
what do you got?
ford had every withdrawal from his Cayman Islands bank account sent to a Mailboxe'N Me store.
we hacked to their fill...
I hacked into.
whatever
anyway, we saw that an hour after ever withdrawal,
sanford sent an overnight pouch to Mexico.
e ach always weighed e same
on pound, three ounces.
and that tells us what?
this is $9, 000 $20 bls.
it weighs exactly one pound, three ounces.
you are a genius, Lucas.
kiss ass.
let me guess-- they're being shipped to Tulum, Mexico.
um... let's see.
how'd you know that?
it here we tracked Christine.
wonder why he sends ca?
attracts less attention.
that's why I don't use checks at a poker table.
Yosa Sford always goes to the me place to send e money.

Oh, shit.
Hey, sir. I'm a cop, all right? I'm on the job.
look, I need that phone for a minute.
look what you did to my suit, man.
I told you you was gonna get me shot.
it's me. I need your help.
all this started because my friend Maurice came by my house.
two days ago, Maurice came by my house.
he all excited.
he got a shoebox.
he had a gun.
he talking about, "Hold this for me for a little while."
I'm like, "I'm on parole." He like, "Me too."
next day, somebody shot him.
thirty-two thousand dollars in that shoebox.
that's a sign, huh? - Yeah.
it's a very big sign.
easy, easy, easy.
you know how much it gonna take me to open the bakery?
thirty-one thousand dollars.
Jack, I got so nervous I ran out the house.
I went to Port Authority and I put the money in a locker.
I get back to my house...
...my parole officer's there...
...in my house.
he got Maurice's gun in his hand.
he looking at me like, "That's it, Eddie."
and he's talking about 15 years, man.
I got so sick.
then the DA came to my cell...
...and he showed me the picture of that cop.
then I met you.
Jack, they clean them lockers out every 24 hours.
I had a little schedule going, man.
court at 10: 00...
...Port Authority at 12.
Hey. Hey, look at me. Wake up.
you aren't gonna die on me, are you?
I don't know, I never died before.
it's not gonna happen today.
Hey. Thank you for coming.
what's going on? - Look. Shot here. I think it went in and out.
Yeah, let's get him in.
I know you.
come on. - I was at your house.
you were at my apartment? - Had to get my gun.
bigmouth.
it was very nice, very clean.
the police grilled me for an hour at the hospital.
What'd you say to them?
that you're a self-medicating, depressed individual.
and you don't care about anything or anyone.
Oh, she's honest, straightforward. That's sexy. I like that.
What'd you do this time, Jack?
he saved my life a couple times.
Hey, he's a good dude. You gotta give him another chance.
I don't know what he did, but you gotta give him another chance.
he gotta have somebody to talk to.
I'm not gonna be around.
Eddie, this is my sister, Diane. - What?
she's your sister?
Oh, man.
I just started having a little hope for you. Your family don't even like you.
I got a sister too.
but she live in Seattle.
I was supposed to go out there and start my bakery.
I was supposed to go out there today to see her.
see her on the bus.
I can stop the bleeding...
...but he's gotta get stitched up, get to a hospital.
we gotta be at the courthouse in less than 20.
you're gonna have to do it.
you're gonna be fine, Eddie. It's not as bad as it looks.
what happened to your hand?
I gotta ask you one more favor.
just a little favor.
Hey, is today really your birthday?
no.
no, I just said that because the little girl, she was so scared.
she was cute, man.
whers your birthday?
I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know?
no, for real, I don't know.
I'm not... I came up in foster care. Had a lot of birthdays.
but didn't you say...? You got a sister, right? That you're going to see?
Yeah, I just found out about her a couple months ago.
never met your sister? - No.
that's why I'm going out to Seattle to meet her.
I'm looking forward.
maybe she turns out to look like Angelina Jolie.
shit, if she do, I hope she ain't my sister.
Hey, man, what you want on your cake, man?
you never told me. I gotta send you one, man.
I don't want no cake, Eddie. - Damn it, Jack, come on, man...
I can't think of anything that has happened in my life...
...that I would want written on a cake. - Nothing?
I'm not a good guy, Eddie.
I'm not a good guy.
Yeah, me neither.
Diane. - Frank.
give me the keys.
stay in the car. - Little out of your sector, aren't you?
saving lives knows no bounds.
you should know that, Frank. - You look good.
you look a little desperate. Doesrt suit you.
open the door.
open the door. Open the door.
sorry, Jack, this is as close as I can get you.
like I said, you're looking good.
Thanks, kid.
all right, come on, let's go.
no, hey, hold on. Hold on a minute.
why is that? Hold on for what?
this is as far as you go too.
come on, man. I don't... - Listen to me, Eddie.
what? - Listen.
those guys you were gonna testify against...
...those cops? - Yeah?
I was one of them.
you were gonna testify against me too.
I did what they did.
we did some bad things.
I did another bad thing when I used you.
I was gonna let you do what I should have done.
what I should have had the courage to do six years ago.
I'm sorry.
you know, if you didn't come to get me today...
...l'd be dead right now.
right. - So...
I was supposed to meet you.
that was the sign.
you saved my life, kid.
take care of yourself, kid.
thank you.
make cakes, Eddie the baker.
Oh, yeah. You give the car keys to your best friend.
you let him take the old lady to the hospital.
you stay at the bus stop with the girl because she's the girl of your dreams, right?
so everything's gonna be okay.
right? - Yeah.
have fun in Seattle. Say hi to your sister.
Yeah.
Yeah.
get him to the Port Authority. Make sure he gets on that bus.
Carl, thanks. - No problem.
all right.
hell of a morning, huh?
Where's the wit?
you're looking at him.
I let the kid go, Frank.
you're not gonna get to him now. - Bullshit.
Wouldrt do that.
so...
...what do you think you're gonna tell them?
are you gonna tell them everything?
are you gonna tell them about you too?
you think that's gonna make you feel better?
nothing's gonna make me feel better.
then why?
look, Jack, you and me...
...we did our business in a certain way.
you never complained when we cleared the tough cases.
it didn't bother you doing any of that until...
listen to me, all right? You listen.
okay, Jack? Really listen.
whatever you think that you are gonna do up there...
...it is never gonna happen.
you are not gonna make it.
is that what you're thinking, Frank?
you're gonna shoot me down here? Nobody knows?
like the Ling family, huh?
like they never knew.
he was a stupid old man who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.
all right, so I stuck a gun in some guy's mouth.
he had a heart attack, he died. So what? - So what?
look, if it hadrt happened the way that it did, if he hadrt died...
...you would've been patting me on the back, saying, "Good job."
collateral damage, it is a fact of life in this business.
he took his last breaths while you were wiping the fingerprints off the room.
he was gonna take down our case. - He was an innocent man.
he was gonna take down our case. - He was somebody's husband.
he was gonna take down our case. - He was somebody's father.
he was gonna take down our case! What were we supposed to do?
he wanted to tell the truth. - Fuck the truth!
right.
I'm not gonna need this anymore.
Bobby? He's on his way up.
take him out.
mosley's in the building! Get the ADA. Freeze!
hands in the air! - Don't shoot.
don't move! Down on your knees. - I'm not armed.
down on your knees! Now! - Don't shoot, I'm not armed.
lower your weapon. Just call ADA MacDonald, please, on the radio.
hands up. - Get ADA MacDonald here right now!
don't shoot. Don't shoot me. - Get your hands up!
just get ADA MacDonald for me.
Jack, come on! - I won't argue with you. Get down.
Mosley! Mosley!
hands up!
Where's my witness? Where's Edward Bunker?
he didn't make it.
I'm gonna take his place.
please lower your weapons. - Hold your fire and stand down.
back off.
I have information...
...regarding your ongoing witness-tampering investigation.
dates, cases that include extortion...
...manslaughter and possible homicide...
...involving members of the 14th Precinct.
these charges include Captain Dan Gruber...
...detectives Jerry Shue...
...Edward Maldonado...
...Bob Torres...
...Jim Mulvey...
...myself...
...and Detective Frank Nugent.
what's this about, Mosley? What do you want?
I want Edward Bunker's record expunged.
done. What else? - Nothing else.
you can substantiate all this, Mosley?
Yeah.
gun!
hold your fire. I fired that shot.
you're gonna shoot me down here? Nobody knows?
like the Ling family, huh?
like they never knew.
he was a stupid old man who wouldn't keep his mouth shut.
all right, so I stuck a gun in some guy's mouth.
he had a heart attack, he died. So what? - So what?
so what? - So how about he was innocent?
innocent? - How about he didn't deserve to die?
look, if it hadrt happened the way that it did, if he hadrt died...
...you would've been patting me on the back, saying, "Good job."
collateral damage, it is a fact of life in this business.
he took his last breaths while you were wiping the fingerprints off the room.
he was gonna take down our case. - He was an innocent man.
he was gonna take down our case. - He was somebody's husband.
he was gonna take down our case. - He was somebody's father.
he was gonna take down our case! What were we supposed to do?
he wanted to tell the truth. - Fuck the truth!
let's get you to the jury.
thanks a lot. - Thanks.
okay.
Hey, happy birthday. - Happy birthday, Jack.
welcome back, Jack.
are you kidding me? - Two years in the pen is enough.
thanks for that memory. Thank you.
happy birthday, Jack. - Happy birthday.
happy birthday. Blow them out. - Welcome home.
I hate birthdays, you know that, right?
sorry, sorry. - Happy birthday.
this came with it.
dear Jack Mosley:
I hope you're doing well and everything worked out like it was supposed to.
I'm doing great.
Seattle is different, and I like it a lot.
I'm not sure I ever smelled fresh air before I got here. It's a trip.
sometimes I can't believe it. It's the best feeling I've had in my life.
I'm busting my ass, but I'm happy, though.
the bakery is now open. Three cheers.
I put my name first because I'm doing all the hard work.
these ovens are hot, man.
hope you like the cake. What did I tell you?
that's Eddie. - Lf you're ever in town, you got a friend.
thank you for doing the right thing, Jack Mosley. God bless you.
keep in touch. Peace.
that's great. - Go on, take one more. Look.
you know how this guy...? I was talking, take one more.
happy birthday, Jack.
Saigon.
shit.
I'm still only in Saigon.
every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back in thejungle.
when I was home after my first tour, it was worse.
I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.
I hardly said a word to my wife until I said yes to a divorce.
when I was here, I wanted to be there.
when I was there, all I could think of was getting backinto thejungle.
I'm here a weeknow.
waiting for a mission...
getting softer.
every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker.
and every minute Charlie squats in the bush, he gets stronger.
each time I looked around, the walls moved in a little tighter.
everyone gets everything he wants.
I wanted a mission...
and for my sins, they gave me one.
brought it up to me like room service.
captain Willard? Are you in there?
Yeah, I'm coming.
it was a real choice mission.
and when it was over,
I'd never want another.
what do you want?
are you all right, Captain?
what does it look like?
are you Willard, 505th Battalion? -AffiIrmative.
173rd Airborne? -Yeah.
assigned to SOG? -Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?
we have orders to escort you to the airfiIeld.
what are the charges?
What'd I do? -There's no charges, Captain.
you have orders to report to Com-Sec Intelligence at Nha Trang.
I see. -All right?
Nha Trang, for me? -That's right.
come on, Captain. You still have a few hours to get cleaned up.
I'm not feeling too good. -Captain?
Dave, come here and give me a hand. We got a dead one.
come on, Captain. Let's take a shower.
don't be an ass. -Get a hold of him good.
we're gonna take a shower, Captain. In we go.
stand underneath this, Captain.
I was going to the worst place in the world...
and I didn't even know it yet.
weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river...
that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable...
plugged straight into kurtz.
it was no accident that I got to be the caretaker...
of Colonel Walter E. kurtz's memory
any more than being back in Saigon was an accident.
there is no way to tell his story without telling my own.
if his story is really a confession
captain Willard reporting, sir.
then so is mine.
captain. Good. Come on in. -Thank you, sir.
stand at ease.
general.
you want a cigarette?
no, thank you, sir.
have you ever seen this man before?
no, sir. -Met the general or myself?
no, sir. Not personally.
you've worked a lot on your own?
Yes, sir, I have.
your report specifiIes intelligence...
counterintelligence with Com-Sec, " I " Corps.
I'm not presently disposed to discuss those operations, sir.
did you not work for the CIA in " I " Corps?
no, sir.
did you not assassinate a government tax collector...
quang Tri Province, June 1 8, 1 968?
captain?
sir, I am unaware of any such activity or operation
nor would I be disposed to discuss such an operation...
if it did, in fact, exist, sir.
I thought we'd have a bite of lunch while we talk.
I hope you brought a good appetite, Captain.
I notice that you have a bad hand there.
you wounded?
I had a little fiIshing accident on R and R, sir.
fishing on R and R? -Yes, sir.
but you're feeling fiIt? You're ready for duty?
Yes, General. Very much so, sir.
well, let's see what we have here, roast beef, and usually it's not bad.
try some, Jerry, and pass it around.
to save a little time, we might pass both ways.
captain, I don't know how you feel about this shrimp...
but if you'll eat it you'll never have to prove your courage in any other way.
I swear, why don't I just take a piece here?
captain, you've heard of Colonel Walter E. kurtz?
Yes, sir, I've heard the name.
Oh, Jesus!
operations offiIcer, Fifth Special Forces.
Luke, would you play that tape for the captain, please?
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. -Listen to this carefully, Captain.
october 6, 0430 hours, sector Peter, Victor, king.
these were monitored out of Cambodia.
this has been verifiIed as Col. kurtz's voice.
I watched a snail...
crawl along the edge of a straight razor.
that's my dream.
that's my nightmare.
crawling, slithering...
along the edge...
of a straight razor...
and surviving.
transmission 1 1, received '68, December 30, 0500 hours.
sector king, Zulu, king.
but we must kill them.
we must incinerate them.
pig after pig.
cow after cow.
village after village. Army after army.
and they call me an assassin.
what do you call it when the assassins accuse the assassin?
they lie.
they lie, and we have to be merciful...
for those who lie.
those nabobs.
I hate them.
I do hate them.
Walt kurtz was one of the most outstanding offiIcers...
this country's ever produced.
he was brilliant. He was outstanding in every way.
and he was a good man, too, a humanitarian man.
a man of wit and humor.
he joined the Special Forces.
and after that his...
ideas, methods...
became...
unsound.
unsound.
now he's crossed into Cambodia with this...
Montagnard army of his that worship the man like a god...
and follow every order, however ridiculous.
well, I have some other shocking news to tell you.
col. kurtz was about to be arrested for murder.
I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?
kurtz had ordered the execution of some Vietnamese intelligence agents
men he believed were double agents.
so he took matters into his own hands.
well, you see, Willard...
in this war, things get confused out there.
power, ideals, the old morality...
and practical military necessity.
but out there with these natives...
it must be a temptation to...
be God.
because there's a conflict in every human heart...
between the rational and the irrational...
between good and evil...
and good does not always triumph.
sometimes...
the dark side...
overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.
every man has got a breaking point.
you and I have them.
Walt kurtz has reached his.
and very obviously, he has gone insane.
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir. Obviously insane.
your mission is to proceed up the Nung River in a navy patrol boat
pick up Col. kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba...
follow it, learn what you can along the way.
when you fiInd the colonel, infiIltrate his team by
whatever means available and terminate the colonel's command.
terminate the colonel?
he's out there operating without any decent restraint...
totally beyond the pale of any acceptable...
human conduct...
and he is still on the fiIeld, commanding troops.
terminate with extreme prejudice.
you understand, Captain, that this mission...
does not exist nor will it ever exist.
how many people had I already killed?
there were those six that I knew about for sure
close enough to blow their last breath in my face.
but this time it was an American...
and an officer.
that wasn't supposed to make any difference to me...
but it did.
shit.
charging a man with murder in this place...
was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.
I took the mission.
what the hell else was I gonna do?
but I really didn't know what I'd do when I found him.
did you check the tank?
Yeah.
I was being ferried down the coast in a navy PBR...
a type of plastic patrol boat
a pretty common sight on the rivers.
they said it was a good way to pick up information and move...
without drawing a lot of attention, and that was okay.
I needed the air and the time.
only problem was I wouldn't be alone.
morning, Captain.
the crew were mostly just kids
rockand rollers with one foot in their graves.
how old are you? -Seventeen.
the machinist--the one they called Chef
was from New Orleans.
he was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.
probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans.
Lance, on the forward fifties...
was a famous surfer from the beaches south of L. A.
to look at him, you wouldn't believe he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.
Clean--Mr. Clean--was from some South Bronx shit-hole...
and I think the light and the space of Vietnam...
really put the zap on his head.
then there was Phillips, the chief.
it might have been my mission, but it sure as shit was the chief " s boat.
there's about two points where we can draw enough water...
to get into the Nung River.
they're both hot. Belong to Charlie.
don't worry about it.
don't smoke.
you know, I've pulled a few special ops in here.
about six months ago...
I took a man who was going up past the bridge at Do Lung.
he was regular army too.
heard he shot himself in the head.
at first I thought they handed me the wrong dossier.
I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead.
third-generation West Point, top of his class.
korea, Airborne, about a thousand decorations.
et cetera, et cetera.
I'd heard his voice on the tape, and it really put the hookin me...
but I couldn't connect up that voice with this man.
like they said, he had an impressive career.
maybe too impressive.
I mean, perfect.
he was being groomed for one of the top slots in the corporation
general, chief of staff, anything.
in 1 664, he returned from a tour with Advisory Command in Vietnam...
and things started to slip.
his report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.
seems they didn't dig what he had to tell them.
during the next few months, he made three requests for transfer...
to Airborne training, Fort Benning, Georgia, and was finally accepted.
airborne?
he was 38 years old.
why the fuck would he do that?
1966, joins Special Forces...
returns to Vietnam.
Hey, what's that?
arc light. -What's up?
b-52 strike. -Yeah?
what's that? -Arc light.
I hate that. Every time I hear that, something terrible happens.
Charlie don't never see them or hear them, man.
there they are.
concussion will suck the air out of your damn lungs.
something terrible is gonna happen.
smoke!
secondary burning.
hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.
let's have a look, Chief.
it was the Air-Cav. First of the Ninth
that's them.
our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River.
but they were supposed to be waiting for us another 30 kilometers ahead.
well, Air Mobile. Those boys just couldn't stay put.
Hey, kid, come on. Get down. Come on.
first of the Ninth was an old cavalry division...
that had cashed in its horses for choppers...
and gone tear-assing around 'Nam looking for the shit.
they'd given Charlie a few surprises in their time here.
what they were mopping up now hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.
just keeping running by. We're for television.
don't look at the camera. Just keep--Go on. keep going.
this is for television. Don't look at the camera.
just go by like you're fiIghting, like you're fiIghting.
don't look at the camera. It's for television. Just go through.
just go by. keep on going.
keep going. Don't look at the camera. Go on. keep going.
all right, come on. Go.
right here. Yes. Over here. Over here.
where can I fiInd the CO?
that's the colonel coming down!
the CO's on that chopper.
lieutenant, bomb that tree line back about 1 00 yards!
give me some room to breathe! -Yes, sir!
body cards!
bring my body cards! -Yes, sir!
I'm the Fourth Tank commander. I got fiIve tanks broken down.
we're all right with the tanks. It's all right, Captain.
captain Willard!
I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence, II Corps.
I understand Nha Trang has briefed you...
on the requirements of my mission.
what mission? I haven't heard from Nha Trang.
sir, your unit is supposed to escort us into the Nung!
we'll see what we can do. -Colonel!
but just stay out of my way until this is done, Captain.
all right, let's see what we have. Let's see what we have.
a two of spades, three of spades, four of diamonds...
six of clubs, eight of spades.
there isn't one worth a jack in the whole bunch.
four of diamonds.
Hey, Captain, what's that? -Death cards!
what? -Death cards!
death? -Lets Charlie know who did this.
cheer up, son. -We will not hurt or harm you.
fire in the hole! -Fire in the hole!
this is an area that is controlled by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.
Jim.
we are here to help you.
we extend a welcome hand...
come on. Everybody in? -to those who would like to return...
to the arms of the South Vietnamese government.
get in. Hurry up.
move it out. -This is an area that is controlled...
by the Vietcong and North Vietnamese.
Hey! What's this?
what is this?
this man's hurt pretty bad, sir.
about the only thing that's holding his guts in, sir, is that pot lid.
yeah? What do you have to say?
this soldier is dirty VC.
he wants water. He can drink paddy water.
get outta here! Give me that canteen.
he's VC! -Any man that's brave enough to
get outta here! I'll kick your fucking ass!
he killed a lot of our people!
any man brave enough to fiIght with his guts...
strapped on him can drink from my canteen.
Hey, Colonel, I think one of those sailors is Lance Johnson, the surfer.
where? Here? You sure?
yeah? Here.
down there.
repeat. We have a body count. We have
what's your name, sailor?
gunner's Mate Third Class Johnson.
gunner's Mate Third Class
lance Johnson, the surfer?
Yes, sir.
it's an honor to meet you.
I've admired your nose riding for years.
I like your cutback too.
I think you have the best cutback there is.
thank you, sir. -You can cut out the " sir " crap.
I'm Bill kilgore. I'm a goofy foot.
this guy with ya? -Yeah.
I want you to meet some guys.
this is Mike from San Diego. -Far out.
Johnny from Malibu.
John, hi. Far out. -Solid surfers.
none of us are anywhere near your class though.
no way.
we do a lot of surfiIng around here.
I like to fiInish operations early.
fly down to Yung Tau for the evening glass.
been riding since you got here?
no way. I haven't surfed since I been here.
through Christ, our Lord...
from Whom all good things come...
through Him in the unity of the Holy Spirit.
all glory and honor is Yours, Almighty Father.
let us bring our iniquities to the Father in the words our Savior gave us.
our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
thy kingdom come.
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread...
and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
kilgore had had a pretty good day for himself.
they choppered in the T-bones and the beer...
and turned the LZ into a beach party.
the more they tried to make it just like home...
the more they made everybody miss it.
make my meat rare--rare but not cold.
well, he wasn't a bad officer, I guess.
he loved his boys, and you felt safe with him.
he was one of those guys that had that weird light around him.
you just knew he wasn't gonna get so much as a scratch here.
what happened to your mission?
Nha Trang forget all about you?
airborne.
sir, two places we can get into the river.
Yeah. -Here and here.
it's a pretty wide delta, but these are the only two spots I'm sure of.
that village you're pointing at is kind of hairy.
what do you mean " hairy, " sir? -It's hairy.
got some pretty heavy ordnance.
I lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
what's the name of that goddamn village?
vin Drin Dop. Dop or Lop?
damn gook names all sound the same.
Mike, you know anything about this point at Vin Drin Dop?
that's a fantastic peak.
peak? -About six foot.
it's an outstanding peak. It's got both the long right and left slide...
with a bowl section that's unbelievable. It's just tube city.
why didn't you tell me that before? A good peak.
there aren't any good peaks in this whole shitty country.
it's all goddamn beach break. -It's really hairy in there.
that's where we lost McDonald.
they shot the hell out of us there. That's Charlie's point.
sir, we can go in there tomorrow at dawn.
there's always a good offshore breeze in the morning.
we may not be able to get the boat in.
the draft at the mouth of that river may be too shallow.
we'll pick your boat up and put it down like a baby where you want it.
this is the First of the Ninth, Air-Cav, son.
air mobile!
I can take that point and hold it as long as I like.
you can get anyplace up that river that suits you, young Captain.
hell, a six-foot peak.
take a gunship back to the division.
Lance, go with Mike and let him pick out a board for you.
bring me my Yater Spoon, the eight-six.
I don't know, sir -What is it, soldier?
it's hairy in there. It's Charlie's point.
Charlie don't surf!
Hey, Jesus, Clean, you ain't gonna believe this. Look.
Hey, man! They're picking up the boat!
how are you feeling, Jimmy?
like a mean motherfucker, sir!
all right, son, let 'er rip.
let's go!
I never have got used to a light board.
I can't get used to one.
I'm used to a heavy board. -I know, it's a real drag.
you prefer a heavy or light board? -Heavier.
Really? -Yeah!
I thought all the young guys like lighter boards.
you can't ride the nose on those.
big Duke Six. Duke Six to Eagle Thrust.
this is Eagle Thrust Seven. We've got it spotted.
put on heading two-seven-zero.
assume attack formation.
that's a roger, Big Duke.
we're going in.
Hey, Lance, we'll come in low out of the rising sun.
about a mile out, we'll put on the music.
music? -Yeah, I use Wagner.
scares the hell out of the slopes. My boys love it.
Hey, they're gonna play music!
how come all you guys sit on your helmet?
so we don't get our balls blown off.
big Duke Six to Eagle Thrust. Put on psy war op.
make it loud. This is a Romeo Fox Trot.
shall we dance?
Yes, sir!
come on! -All right. Fire.
we got a couple--at that tree line.
we're taking fire from the holes.
run, Charlie!
this should make everything burn.
we got a couple of people ahead here.
what's going down here?
we got an automatic! Shoot to kill!
shoot to kill in the open!
I spotted a large weapon down below.
we're gonna go down and check it out.
all right, this is Fox Trot. We're pulling in.
what a shot.
outstanding, Red Team. Outstanding.
get you a case of beer for that.
Six-four-one-zero, we're over the village right now.
I see a vehicle in the courtyard. I'm gonna check it out.
well done, Hawks.
want some twenty-Mike-Mike-Vulcan along those tree lines.
ripple the shit out of them.
got a vehicle on the bridge, 50 caliber on board.
he's moving across to resupply the weapon.
big Duke Six, clear the area. I'm coming down myself.
don't these people ever give up?
nice shot, Bill.
shit! -All right, all right!
it's just a flare! It's a flare!
gotta get outta here! -Un-ass that shit.
get it outta here!
get it out. It's just a flare. It's all right.
everybody all right? Lance?
I'm fiIne!
get down!
I'm not going! I'm not going!
I'm not going.
we just got a secondary down there in the plaza.
hold on to your position.
Duke Six, we've got wounded down there.
get a stretcher over here!
please, God! Help me!
give him some morphine. -My God! Oh!
Where's that duster?
I want my wounded out of there and in the hospital in 1 5 minutes.
I want my men out.
somebody stay in there tight with Big Duke.
this is Ten-Ten. We're gonna be in, throw them on and get out.
she's got a grenade!
she's got a grenade!
the whole thing blew up.
she blew the shit -Fucking savages.
get a medevac.
holy Christ, she's a SAP. I'm gonna get that dinkbitch.
get over there, Johnny. Roll that right skid right up her ass.
we gotta get some air in these trees.
it's goddamn eat-up with enemy down here.
I'm taking fire. I'm taking hits all over.
three o'clock! I'm drawing heavy fiIre!
I'm hit! Mayday! Mayday!
I'm going in. My tail rotor's out. I got control.
what do you think? -Wow! This is really exciting, man.
No! No! The waves!
the waves! -Oh, right.
look at that. Breaks both ways.
watch.
watch. Look! Good six-foot swells!
come here, Lance.
incoming!
this LZ is still pretty hot, sir.
maybe you ought to surf somewhere else.
what do you know about surfiIng, Major?
you're from goddamn New Jersey.
come here! Come here!
change! -You mean right now, sir?
I wanna see how rideable that stuff is. Go change.
it's still pretty hairy out there.
do you wanna surf, soldier? -Yes, sir.
that's good, son, 'cause you either surf or fiIght.
that clear?
get going.
I'll cover for them. And bring a board for Lance.
we can't do shit until the boat gets here.
Lance, I'll bet you can't wait to get out there.
what? -See how they break both ways?
one guy can break right, one left, simultaneous.
what do you think?
we ought to wait for the tide to come up.
come here. Look. -Incoming!
the tide doesn't come in for six hours!
you wanna wait here for six hours?
yo! Chief! Chief!
okay, fellas, quit hiding.
come on! Let's go!
goddamn it!
don't you think it's a little risky for R and R?
if I say it's safe to surf this beach, it's safe to surf this beach!
I'm not afraid to surf this place!
I'll surf this fucking place.
give me that R-T, soldier.
dove Four, this is Big Duke Six. Goddamn it!
I want that tree line bombed!
big Duke Six, roger. Dove One-Three, stand by.
blow them into the Stone Age, son!
out! -No, back, no!
let me take care of this.
get that out of here!
I'm sorry. -Come here now. All right.
no, ma'am. Sorry!
Jimmy!
hawk One-Two, Dove One-Three.
they need some napalm in the tree line.
can you put it down there?
right, One-Three. We're fixing to fuck with them.
what's the target?
we're trying to suppress some mortar fire off the tree line down there.
Roger. Here we come.
good. Give it all you got. Bring in all your ships.
put him in my chopper. Get him back to the hospital.
no, no, no, you got to go with him. -Come on! Go!
get it outta here! Tell my guys I want my board!
big Duke Six, this is Dove One-Three. The jets are inbound now.
you got about 30 seconds to bomb station.
get your people backand heads down.
this is gonna be a big one.
don't worry.
we'll have this place cleaned up in a jiffy, son. Don't you worry.
give me those shorts.
these are from the Air-Cav, a present from me and the boys.
I want to see you do your stuff in them out there.
you smell that?
do you smell that? -What?
napalm, son.
nothing else in the world smells like that.
come on. Move it! Move it! Move it!
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.
you know, one time we had a hill bombed for 1 2 hours.
when it was all over, I walked up.
we didn't fiInd one of them, not one stinking dink body.
but the smell--You know, that gasoline smell.
the whole hill smelled like...
victory.
someday this war's gonna end.
Lance! The wind!
the wind! -What?
it's blowing onshore!
it's gonna blow this place out.
it's gonna ruin it! -Not cool!
it's gonna blow out! -It's the goddamn napalm!
that's what's doing it! -I know.
I'm really sorry, Colonel. I'm afraid that does it.
the kid's got a reputation.
you can't expect him to surf those sloppy waves.
I understand. -I'm an artist, Bill.
I couldn't surf that stuff.
I apologize. It's not my fault.
the waves are getting blown out by the napalm.
don't get me wrong
it was the bombs causing a vortex with the wind.
I accept your apology.
but if you could hang around 20 minutes
some other time, Bill. -Just 20 minutes!
I'm an artist. -keep walking.
okay, give it a try, guys.
one goes left and one goes right.
look, Lance.
you through surfiIng? -Yeah!
wanna say good-bye to the colonel? -No.
you sure? -Yeah!
get the fuck outta here. -It's the napalm.
just wait 20 minutes!
Damn! Fuck!
they've been looking for you.
don't leave without me! -Where the fuck you going?
here!
that's the colonel's surfboard!
incoming! Hey, get the fuck off me! It's mine!
Lance. -Chef, light up, man.
come on. Let's get high.
wanna smoke? -Let's do it, man. Light up.
someday this war's gonna end.
that would bejust fine with the boys on the boat.
they weren't looking for anything more than a way home.
captain? -Trouble is, I'd been back there...
and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore.
buddha time. Here.
all right, that's great, you motherfuckers. Yeah.
if that's how kilgore fought the war...
I began to wonder what they really had against kurtz.
it wasn't just insanity and murder.
there was enough of that to go around for everyone.
I mean, he never was hurting for pussy.
I'm not here. I'm walking through the jungle gathering mangos.
I meet Raquel Welch.
I make a nice mango cream pudding.
you know, kind of spread it around on us.
she's into mangos too.
she's like one limb above me.
we're both in the jungle here nude. -Hey, Chief.
yeah? -Here comes that colonel guy again.
you know how hard it is to find a board you like.
I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.
just give me back the board, Lance.
it was a good board, and I like it.
you know how hard it is to find a board you like.
he's a determined motherfucker!
I will not hurt or harm you.
I will not hurt or harm you.
just give me back the board, Lance.
it was a good board, and I like it.
you know how hard it is to find a board you like.
I will not hurt or harm you. -Jesus Christ.
that guy's too fucking much, man.
do you think he would have shot us?
he wouldn't have shot us on the beach...
but he would have shot us if he saw me taking his board.
let's go surfingnow Everybody's learninghow -Let's get this board out of my turret. -Sucker.
how am I going to shoot him the next time he comes around?
Hey, Chef, make some room back there for the board.
sock it to me, Lance.
I wonder if that's the same chopper.
he's probably got them all over the river with that recording.
we'll have to hold up here till dark, Chief.
don't worry, Lance. He won't follow us too far.
what makes you say that?
you think that big Cav colonel wants everyone upriver...
to know we stole his board? －I didn't steal it!
captain?
just how far up this river we going?
it's classifiIed, Chief. I can't tell ya.
we're going up pretty far.
is it gonna be hairy?
I don't know, kid.
Yeah, probably.
you like it like that, Captain, when it's hot, hairy?
fuck.
maybe you'll get a chance to know what the fuck you are in some factory in Ohio.
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those mangos now, okay?
take somebody with ya. -Yeah, I'll take
I'll go with him.
chef?
Yes, sir? -How come they call you that?
call me what, sir? -Chef.
because you like mangos and stuff?
no, sir, I'm a real chef.
I'm a saucier. -Saucier?
Yes, sir. See,
I come from New Orleans.
I was raised to be a saucier, a great saucier.
what's a saucier? -You specialize in sauces.
gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.
then, I was supposed to go to Paris...
study at the EscoffiIer school.
but then I got orders for my physical.
hell, I joined the navy.
heard they had better food.
cook school--that did it.
Yeah, how's that? -You don't wanna hear about that.
they lined us up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib.
all of us, you know, lined up looking at it.
MagnifiIcent meat. Really! Beautifully marbled.
next thing, they're throwing the meat into these big cauldrons
all of it--boiling it!
I looked inside, man. It was turning gray.
I couldn't fucking believe that one.
that's when I applied for radioman school, but then they gave me
what is it?
Charlie?
it's a tiger! Son of a bitch!
it's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!
battle stations. Lance, up front.
get on your 60! -Got it.
holy shit! Chef, come on!
a fucking tiger!
captain, come on!
let's go!
you were right. Never get out of the boat.
bring that 60 forward!
I gotta remember! Never get out of the boat!
never get out of the boat!
what happen? How many is it?
a fucking tiger! -What? A tiger?
Yes! I've had it!
I've had the whole goddamn fucking shit, man!
you can kiss my ass on the county square...
because I'm fucking bugging out.
I don't fucking need it! I don't want it.
all I wanted to do was fucking cook!
I just wanted to learn to fucking cook, man!
you're all right.
you're all right. You're gonna be all right.
never get out of the fucking boat.
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Good-bye!
never get out of the boat.
absolutely, goddamn right...
unless you were going all the way.
kurtz got off the boat.
he split from the whole fucking program.
how did that happen?
what did he see here that first tour?
thirty-eight fucking years old.
if you joined the Green Berets...
there was no way you'd ever get above colonel.
kurtz knew what he was giving up.
the more I read and began to understand...
the more I admired him.
his family and friends couldn't understand it...
and they couldn't talk him out of it.
he had to apply three times, and he put up with a ton of shit.
but when he threatened to resign, they gave it to him.
the next youngest guy in his class was half his age.
they must have thought he was some far-out old man...
humping it over that course.
I did it when I was 1 6. It damn near wasted me.
a tough motherfucker.
he finished it.
he could have gone for general...
but he went for himself instead.
dear Eva...Today was really a new one.
almost got eaten alive by a fucking tiger.
really un-fucking believable, you know?
we're taking this guy, Captain Willard, up the river...
but he hasn't told us yet where we're taking him.
thought you might have heard by now from Elwood.
october 1 667.
on special assignment kontoom Province, II Corps.
kurtz staged Operation Archangel with combined local forces.
rated a major success.
he received no official clearance.
he just thought it up and did it.
what balls.
they were gonna nail his ass to the floorboards for that one.
but after the press got ahold of it...
they promoted him to full colonel instead.
Oh, man, the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam.
you needed wings to stay above it.
this sure enough is a bizarre sight in the middle of this shit.
expecting us this time?
damned if I know.
Jesus
it goes back up into the truck. -What?
we gotta get all that stuff up.
Hau Phat. You ever been up here before, Chef?
I bet you we can score up here.
check out the bikes, Lance.
yamaha, Suzuki. Yeah!
that's a good one. -Yeah, Sukiyaki.
Yeah, man. This is something.
please! -This must be the guy.
right over there.
sergeant.
three drums of diesel fuel, PBR fiIve
come on, man! Move! We don't have time.
one hour. That's all. What do you want?
can I get some Panama Red? -Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.
sergeant? -Destination?
I don't have no destination.
I can't do a goddamn thing without a destination.
Sarge? Sarge? -I need a destination!
I can't do a thing about it with a destination.
these guys are with me. Destination's classifiIed.
I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence.
okay, right, sir. Hey, listen, it's a real big night.
eight bucks for that -Hey!
all right. Damn.
just give him some fuel. -You got it.
dog starts barking. -Hey, listen, Captain.
I'm really sorry about tonight.
it's really bad around here.
just take this over to the man at the supply desk and you got it.
would you guys like some seats--some press box seats for the show?
the show out here.
bunnies, bunnies. -Playboy bunnies?
you got it. You gonna be here?
Hey, listen, Captain, on the house.
no hard feelings, huh?
how ya doing out there?
I said, how ya doing out there?
wanna say hello to you from all of us up here...
to all of you out there who work...
so goddamn hard in Operation Brute Force!
Hello, all you paratroopers out there!
and the marines! And the sailors!
we wanna let you know that we're proud of you!
we know how tough and how hard it's been.
to prove it we're gonna give you entertainment you're gonna like.
miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty.
miss May, Miss Terri Teray! Yeah!
and the playmate of the year,
miss Carrie Foster! Yeah!
come on! -What's the matter?
grease my gun!
I'm ready to powwow, baby!
you're cute. I like you.
I'm here, baby! I'm here!
Yeah!
you fucking bitch! -Take it off!
take it off!
Hey, lover! You want us to come over!
I sure do! -Sign my centerfold!
sign my centerfold!
come on, baby!
start her up. Hey!
get out of my way!
will you sign these? Come on!
let's go!
let's go! Hurry!
so long!
Charlie didn't get much USO.
he was dug in too deep or moving too fast.
his idea of great R and R was cold rice and a little rat meat.
he had only two ways home
death or victory.
no wonder kurtz put a weed up Command's ass.
the war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns...
who were gonna end up giving the whole circus away.
Hey, you know, man, that was far-fucking-out.
I collected every picture of her since she was Miss December, Chief.
Hey, Clean, look at that. She was here, man.
I even wrote to the cunt.
she didn't write me back.
you can really get hung up on these broads, man...
just like that cat in the delta.
Yeah, you better believe it. -What cat?
the one that went up for murder.
he was an army sergeant.
remember? This cat, man--He really dug his Playboy, man.
I mean like this guy
when the thing arrived, he was there to meet it, man.
look at these beautiful fucking jugs, man!
Yeah, so anyway, he was working ARVN patrols.
one of them cocky gook asshole lieutenants and shit
one day the gook took his magazine and wouldn't give it back.
he said, " Give me my magazine back. "
gook say, " You shut up.
I have you court-martialed. "
typical fucking ARVN. -Yeah!
then the gook starts to go too far.
chef. Take the wheel.
this dude started to stick pinholes in the lady's tits.
he started sticking pinholes and mutilating the centerfold.
the sergeant said, " You better not do that to her.
you leave your shitty little gook hands off of that girl.
don't do her like that. "
gook say " Fuck you " in Vietnamese. -Damn.
the sergeant couldn't handle it no more.
he just picked up his iron...
flipped it to rock and roll and
gave that little zero a long burst straight through the Playboy mag.
it blew his ass clean off of the dock.
there wasn't no more lieutenant that day.
that was it for his ass.
they burn him for it? -The sergeant? Yeah, man.
they stuck his ass in the LBJ.
it's too bad he didn't get no medals or nothing.
fucking ARVN, man.
they should have killed the fuck.
should have given the fucker a Silver Star.
bummer for the gook though, ain't it?
good morning, Vietnam.
I'm Army Specialist ZackJohnson on AMVN.
it's about 82 degrees in downtown Saigon right now, also very humid.
we have an important message for all GI's...
who are living off base from the mayor of Saigon.
he'd like you to hang your laundry up indoors instead of on the windowsills.
the mayor wants you to keep Saigon beautiful.
now here's another blast from the past going out to Big Sam who's all alone out there with the 1 st Battalion, 35th Infantry...
and dedicated by the fire team to their groovy CO.
the Rolling Stones, " Satisfaction. " -All right!
watch out, Clean!
get down, bubba!
hang on, Lance!
get down, bubba!
tell them you did it, Lance.
all right!
look out, Lance!
commitment and Counterinsurgency...
by cononel Walt E. kurtz
as long as our officers and troops perform...
tours of duty limited to one year...
they will remain dilettantes in war and tourists in Vietnam.
as long as cold beer, hot food, rockand roll...
and all the other amenities remain the expected norm...
our conduct of the war will gain only impotence.
we need fewer men, and better.
if they were committed, this war could be won...
with a fourth of our present force. "
shit. Chicken time.
you ain't shitting, bro. They're motherfucking.
who is that? －What's going on?
is that you, Lazzaro?
fire on the canopy!
I got it! Get outta there!
Yeah! I got it! I got it! I got it!
Lance, get down!
put that fucker out, man!
what the fuck they think they're doing?
late summer, autumn 1 668.
kurtz's patrols in the highlands coming under frequent ambush.
the camp started falling apart.
november.
kurtz orders assassination of three Vietnamese men and one woman.
two of the men were colonels in the South Vietnamese army.
enemy activity in his old sector dropped off to nothing.
guess he must have hit the right four people.
Hejoined the Special Forces.
after that his
the army tried one last time to bring him backinto the fold.
methods
if he'd pulled over it all would have been forgotten.
unsound.
but he kept going.
now he's crossed into Cambodia
he kept winning it his way.
with this Montagnard army of his
and they called me in.
man like a god and follow every order, however ridiculous.
they lost him.
he was gone.
nothing but rumors and random intelligence...
mostly from captured VC.
the VC knew his name by now, and they were scared of him.
he and his men were playing hit-and-run all the way into Cambodia.
I know what I'm doing.
I'm going to the White House to have dinner...
with the president of the United States.
that's where I'm going.
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.
clean.
how long has that kid been on this boat?
seven months.
he's really specializing in busting my balls.
very possible, Captain, he thinks the same of you.
Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?
I don't think.
my orders say I'm not supposed to know where I'm taking this boat so I don't!
but one look at you, and I know it's gonna be hot, wherever it is.
we're going upriver about 7 5 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge.
that's Cambodia, Captain.
that's classifiIed.
we're not supposed to be in Cambodia, but that's where I'm going.
you just get me close to my destination and I'll cut you and the crew loose.
all right, Captain.
'dear Son...
I'm afraid that both you and your mother will have been worried...
at not hearing from me during the past weeks...
but my situation here has become a difficult one.
I have been officially accused of murder by the army.
the alleged victims were four Vietnamese double agents.
we spent months uncovering them and accumulating evidence.
when absolute proof was completed, we acted
we acted like soldiers.
the charges are unjustified.
they are, in fact, and in the circumstances of this conflict...
quite completely insane.
in a war, there are many moments for compassion and tender action.
there are many moments for ruthless action
what is often called ruthless...
but may in many circumstances be only clarity
seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it-- "
medevac, come in. - " directly
quickly, awake.
alpha, Tango, Tango, -Echo, Tango, Alpha. -Looking at it.
request dust-off. Three, maybe four kIA 's. Over.
I trust you tell your mother what you choose about this letter.
as for the charges against me, I am unconcerned.
medevac, come in.
I am beyond their timid, lying morality, and so I am beyond caring.
medevac, do you read? Over.
you have all my faith.
your loving father.
Jesus.
no wonder I couldn't get them on the radio.
what a dump.
hi there! -How ya doing?
that's a nice little boat you got there.
never seen one up here before.
we called in a request for Medevac.
you receive it?
medevac? No.
we passed a downed Huey with some kIA's.
on your way here? -Yeah.
you going up this river? -Way up.
way upriver? Forget it.
Why?
we want to send some people downriver.
just forget it. -What the fuck was that?
we'll be back in a couple of days.
Yeah, right, you'll be back.
chief? -Yeah, Captain?
why don't you see what you can do with that engine?
I'm gonna look around. -All right.
Hey, don't leave without me.
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?
don't ask me, man.
give my clothes back, you asshole!
asshole!
Hey, guys, where's the CO?
he stepped on a land mine about two months ago.
he got blown to hell.
who's in charge here? -Charge?
I don't know, man. I'm just the night man.
just do what I'm told. Shit.
I'm just a working girl.
what about you, fella?
Hey, Lance, man, I'm telling you it's gonna jam.
you mark my words.
keep it in that condition -Get off my back!
no, man, I'm telling you -Lay off!
Hey! Hey! Come here!
is that your boat? Come on inside.
what do you want?
come on inside. I want to talk to you. Come on!
get out of the rain.
get off me!
come on. Cut this shit. Hey, Chef. Hey, come on.
Hey, how ya doing, Captain?
I want you to meet some people.
I got your ass. -Your ass is shit.
chef, your ass is shit!
you're a motherfucker, man.
goddamn, my ear, you motherfucker!
get him off me, Chef. -You smart-ass.
Hey, guys.
I got you! I got your ass!
you ain't shit, Chef. -Hey, fellas.
you pulled my fucking -Hey, guys.
I just made a deal with the people from Hau Phat.
I negotiated two barrels of fuel for a couple of hours with the bunnies.
Hey! Hey! You shitting me?
no, I'm not.
grab a couple of barrels and get up to that big tent.
come on!
captain.
you're giving away our fuel for a playmate of the month?
Nope, playmate of the year, Chief.
warm them up, baby!
warm them up!
captain, we get in a fiIre fiIght and run out of fuel...
I want you to tell me how she was.
I made a deal for all of us, Chief. How about you?
you got some mamas in there? -Some what?
forget it, Captain. I'll stay with the boat.
Hey, Captain! Give me a hand.
you know, I got a
I got every one of your pictures.
I got the centerfold, the playmate's review...
the playmate of the year runoff.
I even got the calendar.
Hey, oiseau. How come you got a bird?
I used to be the bird girl at Busch Gardens.
Busch Gardens? -I used to train birds there.
you are
you are Miss December, aren't you? -Miss May.
is it coming?
miss December has black hair. -It's over there.
he's not one of my regular birds.
come on. Come on, baby. Snack?
snatch a crack. Come here.
being playmate of the year...
is the loneliest experience I can imagine.
it's like--You try to express...
your feelings to someone and show them your heart
Yeah, I want to hear about your bird act.
I'd love to hear about your bird act.
but would you mind just putting this
would you just mind putting this black wig on for me, please?
and there's this glass wall between you
this invisible glass.
they can see your mouth moving.
I used to train birds for at least two years
that's beautiful. -at Busch Gardens.
this was cascading over your right shoulder.
this was open here.
but they can't hear what you're saying.
I used to train them to stand on their head and ride a bicycle
your right hand was-- -Hey, Chef!
get outta here, man! -Come on!
does he want to talk to you?
later. Give me 1 5 minutes.
you can never really make them hear what you're trying to say.
you okay with kind of bending? That's it.
your ass was sticking out just a little--Hey, man, fuck off!
fifteen minutes!
that's why I tried so desperately...
to show somebody that I had some talent.
little baby macaws.
have you ever seen a baby macaw? -That's kind of open there.
they're all blue-- -Take off, would you?
I got my rights, man!
they make you do things you don't wanna do
like, this picture here.
I started feeling repulsed with myself.
you were just kind of bending forward. Your ass kind of out a bit.
I love training birds.
that's it. That's very--That's it. Voila.
you're beautiful. I just want to
you know, I can't believe it.
me, J. Hicks. I can't believe
I'm really here.
maybe I'm unfiIt to have a relationship...
with a beautiful, innocent boy.
just think, if it hadn't been for the Vietnam War...
I never would have met you, Miss December.
miss May.
I wish--I wish I could fiInd...
just one person...
that could share my point of view.
Oh, you kiss like a bird!
Oh, God! kiss me! kiss me!
who is that?
you're driving me crazy! kiss me!
I love birds!
you fiInished yet?
Oh! Fuck!
like a bird! Take me like a bird!
fly, baby! Cock it to me!
fly! -I can fly like an eagle!
fly like an eagle! -It drives me crazy!
it drives me crazy!
Lance, that was somebody's son.
Lance, there were things that they made me do...
that I didn't want to do.
they said, " Pull the ribbons between your legs. "
I didn't want to do it.
but they said that was what was expected of me...
that that's what people wanted to see.
who are you? -Well, I'm next, ma'am.
ha, ha! Hell, I didn't know it was a cherry.
didn't know you never got no pussy. -Shove it, fuckup.
sorry about that. If I'd have known,
I'd take you to New Orleans.
man, fuck you. -Introduce you to
lay off, Chef. -Cherry boy, cherry boy.
you're a fucking dog!
come to New Orleans.
I'll get you fiIxed up, ya prick.
lay off, Chef.
you're the only fucking prick I see around here.
if I wanna play with a prick, I'll play with my own.
what are you gonna do with it, cherry boy?
chef, I said lay off!
chef, knock it off! Give him a break!
what do you think I said?
then give your jaws a rest!
this ain't the army. You are a sailor!
so get out of that frizzly army-looking shirt...
and stop smoking that dope! You hear me?
Lance, what's with all the green paint?
camouflage. -How's that?
so they can't see ya. They're everywhere, Chief.
I want you to stay awake up there, man. You got a job to do.
sampan off the port bow. Sampan off the port bow.
let's take a look, Lance.
bring them in. Clean, on the 60. Chef, get a 1 6.
clean, get on that 60!
what's up, Chief?
Ajunk boat, Captain. We're gonna take a routine check.
well, let's forget routine now and let them go.
these boats are running supplies in this delta, Captain.
I'm gonna take a look.
my mission's got priority.
you wouldn't even be in this part of the river if it wasn't for me.
until we reach your destination,
captain, you're just on for the ride.
stand by, Lance. -Come on. Throw the rope, asshole.
all right. Come on. Let's bring it over.
look in that forward hooch.
bring the people out of there.
come on! Hurry up, motherfucker!
I got you, Chief.
it's clear, Chief.
okay, that's them. That's them. They're okay.
board and search it. -It's just a fucking boat.
there ain't nothing on it. -Board it and search it.
just some baskets and some ducks, fucking bananas.
ain't nothing on it.
what's wrong? Search it. -There's the goat and some fiIsh.
chef! -Fucking vegetables
get on that boat! -There's nothing on it, man!
get on it! -All right!
move it, asshole! Goddamn it!
just some pigs! Look, mangoes!
what's in the rice bag? -Fucking rice!
look in there! -Some fucking fiIsh!
more coconuts. Rice. Here's rice.
what's in that vegetable basket? -Get out of here!
there ain't nothing in here! -What's in the boxes?

it's a fucking puppy.
it's a fucking puppy.

Chef-- -You want that? Fucking mango too!
she's moving behind you. She's alive. Check her out.

give him a hand.
just take it easy.
slow down and take it easy. -Chef, wait a minute.
bring her up. -Is she breathing?
she's hurt. She's bleeding.
bring her on board. We're taking her to an ARVN.
what are you talking about?
we're taking her to some friendlies.
she's wounded. She's not dead. -Get out of there.
the book says
fuck you. Fuck 'im.
I told you not to stop. Now let's go.
it was a way we had over here of living with ourselves.
we'd cut them in half with a machine gun and give them a Band-Aid.
it was a lie.
and the more I saw of them...
the more I hated lies.
those boys were never gonna look at me the same way again...
but I felt like I knew one or two things about kurtz that weren't in the dossier.
do Lung Bridge was the last army outpost on the Nung River.
beyond it, there was only kurtz.
what do you think? -It's beautiful.
what's the matter with you? You're acting kind of weird.
Hey, you know that last tab of acid I was saving?
Yeah, I know. -I dropped it.
you dropped acid? -Far out.
friendly! Friendly! Friendly!
take me home! -Goddamn it!
fucking shore police! Shit! -Man, you wanna die?
don't keep going!
you fucking police! -Don't leave me!
fuck you!
you'll get what you deserve!
is there a Captain Willard on board? -Yeah.
captain Willard? -Yeah. Who's that?
lieutenant Carlsen, sir. -Get that light off me!
I was sent here from Nha Trang with these three days ago, sir.
expected you here a little sooner. This is mail for the boat.
don't know how happy this makes me.
Why? -Now I can get out of here, if I can fiInd a way.
you're in the asshole of the world, Captain.
captain, where you going?
see if I can fiInd some fuel and get some information.
pick me up at the other side of the bridge.
somebody go with him. -Chef.
I'll go.
I wanna go.
man, listen to the music, man.
where can I fiInd the CO?
you came right to it, son of a bitch! －Lance.
get down here!
you still got a commanding offiIcer here?
Beverly Hills. -What?
straight up the road, there's a concrete fucking bunker called Beverly Hills!
where the fuck else do you think it would be?
goddamn it! You stepped in my face.
I thought you were dead.
well, you thought wrong, damn it!
I told you to stop fucking with me, didn't I?
you think you're so bad, huh, nigger?
what are you shooting at, soldier?
what the fuck ya think I'm shooting at?
I'm sorry, sir.
there are gooks out there by the wire.
but I think I killed them all.
you ain't shot shit. Listen.
Oh, shit. He's trying to call his friends.
send up a flare.
think you so bad, huh, nigger? You think you bad, huh?
they're all dead, stupid.
there's one still alive underneath them bodies.
who's the commanding offiIcer here?
ain't you?
you think you so bad?
I got something for your ass now, nigger!
I got something for you now!
he's underneath the bodies, man.
go get the Roach, nigger! -Go get the Roach for me.
roach. Roach.
roach.
got slopes on the wire, man. You hear them?
Lance. -Do you hear them?
we'll bust them!
hear him out there on the wire, man?
Yeah.
I kill you, GI!
you need a flare?
no.
he's close, man.
he's real close.
fuck you, GI! I kill you!
fuck you, GI!
motherfucker.
Hey, soldier.
do you know who's in command here?
Yeah.
holy shit.
Hey, Chief, man. Two guys just got blown off that bridge.
you hang on, man. You're gonna be okay.
what's that? -Mail, man. Mail.
later on the mail. Watch them trees.
there's no diesel fuel, but I picked up some ammo.
let's move out.
did you fiInd the CO, Captain?
there's no fucking CO here.
let's just get going.
which way, Captain?
you know which way, Chief.
you're on your own, Captain.
still wanna go on? It's like this bridge.
we build it every night, Charlie blows it right back up again...
just so the generals can say the road's open.
think about it.
who cares? -Just get us upriver!
chef, on the bow.
stand by, Clean. -Let's go!
whose package is that?
shit, you got another one, Clean. -No shit? Wait a minute.
you got one, Miller. Geez, I got some too.
that's it for you. Lance.
Mr. L. B.Johnson, there you go.
far out, man. All right. I've been waiting for this one.
I got another one.
I got a box from Eva.
'Lance. I'm fiIne. I'm fiIne.
sue and I went tripping in Disneyland.
sue skinned her knee. "
man, I wanna get back to Antoine's.
'I remember the time we went up to-- "
how could I fucking forget?
beautiful.
'there could never be a place like Disneyland, or could there?
let me know. "
Jim, it's here. It really is here.
'there has been a new development regarding your mission...
which we must now communicate to you.
months ago, a man was ordered on a mission which was identical to yours.
we have reason to believe that he is now operating with Col. kurtz.
Saigon was carrying him MIA for his family's sake...
but they assumed he was dead.
then they intercepted a letter he tried to send to his wife. "
captain Richard Colby.
he was with kurtz.
Disneyland.
fuck, man, this is better than Disneyland.
'Charles Miller Manson ordered the slaughter of all in the home...
anyway as a symbol of protest. "
that's really weird, ain't it?
purple haze. Look, man. -Hey, Lance, put away that smoke.
I got a tape from my mom.
rainbow reality, man.
Hey, Chief, get a good whiff.
Eva can't picture me in Vietnam.
she pictures me at home having a beer watching TV.
Hey, Lance, man. -Oh, hot potato, hot potato.
I'm so glad you decided to join the navy.
Eva's not sure she can have a relationship with me, you know.
here I am, 1 3, 000 fucking miles away...
trying to keep a relationship with my ass.
that's much more than I can say for some of your friends.
if this tape is any good...I will have Dad and the family -send you a tape of their own. -Hey, Lance.
there! Over there!
there. Over there!
chef, check out Clean!
captain, he's hit. Clean's hit.
Lance! -Where'd the dog go?
Lance! They got Clean.
Where's the dog? We gotta go back and get the dog.
Hey, Clean. Hey.
Bubba, you can't die, you fucker!
and so I'm hoping that--pretty soon
not too soon--but pretty soon
I'll have a lot of grandchildren to love and spoil.
and then when your wife get them back, she'll be mad with me.
even Aunt Jessie and Mama...
will come to celebrate your coming home.
granny and Dad are trying to get enough money to get you a car...
but don't tell them because that's our secret.
anyhow, do the right thing...
stay out of the way of the bullets...
and bring your heinie home all in one piece...
because we love you very much.
love, Mom.
clean.
hold on.
throw me the glasses.
Lance, take a 1 6 on the bow.
chef. Chef. On the 60.
fuck me.
Lance.
cover the captain.
cover the captain. Lance.
they're French. They're French.
pick up that weapon! Pick it up! Pick it up!
stand fast. Captain.
all right, you men. Put down your weapons.
we lost one of our men.
we French always pay respect to the dead of our allies.
you're all welcome.
my name is Hubert DeMarais.
this is my family's plantation.
it has been such for 70 years.
and it will be such until we are all dead.
captain, accept the flag of Tyrone Miller...
on behalf of a grateful nation.
this food is really wonderful, isn't it?
the wine, the sauces.
I can't believe it.
Hey, can I speak with the chef?
the chef speak only Vietnamese.
no kidding? He cooks like this and he can't even speak French?
Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.
Lance.
this is Baudelaire.
it's a very cruel poem for children.
but they need it, 'cause life sometimes is very cruel.
as you can see.
attack repels by the family.
just for this war.
Vietcong, 58.
north Vietnamese, 1 2.
south Vietnamese, 1 1 .
americans, six?
Yes. Well, there were perhaps mistakes.
may I present Captain Willard.
he is of a paratroop regiment.
Madame Sarrault. -Captain.
Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. It was just a little story...
about Paris and people starving during the war.
they are all around the table, and there was a silence and somebody say...
an angel is passing by. "
so somebody said, " Let's eat it. "
how long can you possibly stay here?
we stay forever.
no, no. I mean...
why don't you go back home to France?
back home?
I mean, this is our home, Captain.
sooner or later, you're-- －No.
you don't understand our mentality
the French offiIcer mentality!
at fiIrst, we lose in Second World War.
I don't say that you Americans win, but we lose.
Oh, Papa
in Dien Bien Phu, we lose. In Algeria, we lose.
in Indochina, we lose!
but here we don't lose!
this piece of earth, we keep it.
we will never lose it. Never!
you Americans.
in 1 945, yeah...
after the Japanese war, your President Roosevelt didn't want the French people to stay in Indochina.
So...you Americans implant the Vietminh.
what's he mean? -Yeah, that's true.
the Vietcong were invented by the Americans.
the Americans?
and now you take the French place...
and the Vietminh fiIght you.
and what can you do?
nothing.
absolutely nothing.
the Vietnamese are very intelligent.
you never know what they think.
the Russian ones who help them,
come and give us their money.
we are all Communists. Chinese, give us guns. We are all brothers. "
they hate the Chinese!
maybe they hate the American less than the Russian and the Chinese.
I mean, if tomorrow the Vietnamese are Communists...
they will be Vietnamese Communists.
and this is something that you never understood, you American.
I don't know.
maybe in the future we can make something with the Vietminh.
don't you understand?
the VC say, " Go away. Go away. "
that's fiInish for all the white people in Indochina.
if you're French, American, that's all the same.
'go. " They want to forget you.
look, Captain.
look, this is the truth.
an egg.
the white left...
but the yellow stays!
when I was in Saigon, I spoke to an American politician.
he explained it very well. He said, " Look.
yesterday, it was korea. Today, Vietnam.
tomorrow, Thailand, the Philippines...
then maybe Europe. "
come on. Why not Europe?
look what happened in Czechoslovakia recently.
even before Second World War
americans knew exactly what was going on.
they don't want that shit to take over! LeFevre!
all you white people are shit.
they are fiIghting--fiIghting for freedom.
freedom? Bullshit.
french bullshit. American bullshit.
Dien Bien Phu, that serious.
all soldiers know they are already dead.
you know anything about Dien Bien Phu?
Yeah, I know. -No, you don't.
not really.
Dien Bien Phu was an error. A military mistake.
a mistake? A voluntary mistake!
voluntary!
all the soldiers knew.
we knew we would be dead.
the generals and the colonels believe it's impossible for the Viets...
to get the cannon up there in the mountains.
but they do.
then they wait for the rain to come.
when it comes, no airplane can fly there.
and our paratroopers jump at 90 meters.
I mean, you know, 90 meters--70 meters.
I mean, that's crazy.
no army in the world can do that.
and they only do that to be dead with their friends.
the French Army was sacrifiIced.
SacrifiIced by the politicians safe at home.
they put the army in an impossible situation where they couldn't win.
the students are marching in Paris protesting, demonstrating.
they stab the soldiers in their back.
the soldier would open the grenade, it wouldn't work.
a piece of paper would fall
'union of French Women. " " We are for the Viets. "
traitors! Communist traitors at home.
Dien Bien Phu, okay.
the French is shit, huh?
no one care. No one want
why don't you Americans learn from us, from our mistakes?
mon Dieux, with your army, your strength your power, you could win if you want to!
you can win.
you know, I'm sure we can make something here.
I'm sure about it, you know?
I never do something wrong to the people here.
that's right, but the Communist at home have never been traitors.
capitaine, good night.
he was a Socialist, you know.
I know that we can stay.
I know that we can stay. We can.
you know, we always helped the people.
we work with the people.
so we can be friends, we are agreed.
see, Captain, when my grandfather...
and my uncle's father came here...
there was nothing--nothing.
the Vietnamese were nothing.
so we worked hard...
the rubber from Brazil, and then plant it here.
we took the Vietnamese, work with them...
make something--something out of nothing.
so when you ask me why we want to stay here, Captain...
we want to stay here because it's ours it belongs to us. It keeps our family together.
I mean, we fiIght for that.
while you Americans, you are fiIghting for...
the biggest nothing in history.
I'm sorry, Captain.
I will see if your men need any help to repair your boat...
so that you can go on with your war.
I apologize for my family, Captain.
we have all lost much here.
Hubert--his wife and two sons.
and I have lost a husband.
I understand.
you are tired of the war.
I can see it in your face.
twas the same in the eyes of the soldiers of our war.
we called them " Les Soldats Perdus-- "
the Lost Soldiers.
if you like, we can have some cognac.
no. I...
I have to--to see about my men and
the war will be still here tomorrow.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I noticed you had no wine at dinner.
no, I don't drink wine.
I do like cognac, but I don't want any now. Thank you.
well...
then I--I must drink alone.
will you go back after the war to America?
no.
then you're like us--your home is here.
do you know why you can never step into the same river twice?
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.
I used to prepare a pipe for my husband.
twas the morphine he took for the wounds he suffered in his heart.
he would rage and he would cry, my lost soldier.
and I said to him,
there are two of you. Don't you see?
one that kills and one that loves. "
and he said to me...
'I don't know whether I'm an animal or a god. "
but you are both.
you want more?
all that matters is that you're alive.
you are alive, Captain.
that's the truth.
there are two of you, don't you see?
one that kills...and one that loves.
can't see nothing. We stopping.
you're not authorized to stop this boat, Chief.
I said I can't see a thing,
captain. I'm stopping this boat.
I ain't risking no more lives.
I'm in command here, goddamn it.
you'll do what I say.
you see anything, Chef?
why don't they fucking attack, man?
watch it over here, Chief.
got a stump.
Lance, On the fiIfties.
he was close.
he was real close.
I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him...
as if the boat were being sucked upriver...
and the water was flowing backinto thejungle.
whatever was going to happen...
it wasn't going to be the way they called it backin Nha Trang.
arrows! -Fire!
chef, open up! Fire!
Lance, fiIre!
chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit fiIring.
they're just little toy arrows.
cut it out! Quiet!
chief, tell them to hold their fiIre!
they're just little sticks.
they're just trying to scare us.
quiet!
you got us into this mess, and now you can't get us out...
you got us into this mess, and now you can't get us out...
do ya?
you son of a bitch! You bastard!
Lance, get the wheel!
you savages! Come and get it! You son of a bitches!
a spear?
my mission is to make it up into Cambodia.
there's a Green Beret colonel up there who's gone insane...
and I'm supposed to kill him.
that's fucking typical! Shit!
fucking Vietnam mission!
I'm short and we gotta go up there so you can kill one of our own guys?
that's fucking great!
shit! That's fucking crazy.
I mean, I thought you were going in to blow up a bridge...
or some fucking railroad tracks or something.
that's all right. -No. No, wait. Wait.
we'll go together, on the boat. We'll go with you.
we'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?
part of me was afraid of what I would find...
and what I would do when I got there.
I knew the risks...
or imagined I knew.
but the thing I felt the most...much stronger than fear...
was the desire to confront him.
just keep moving.
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.
it's all right! It's all right! It's all been approved!
I ain't coming in there! Them bastards attacked us!
Hey, zap them with your siren, man. Zap them with your siren.
there's mines over there and mines over there too.
and watch out. Those goddamn monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.
Ah, that's a pretty one. Move it right in towards me.
I'm an American. Yeah. An American civilian.
Hi, Yanks.
Hi. American. American civilian. It's all right.
and you got the cigarettes. And that's what I've been dreaming about.
Chelf.
who are you?
who are you?
I'm a photojournalist.
I've covered the war since '64.
I've been in Laos, Cambodia and 'Nam.
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing. This boat is a mess, man.
who are all these people?
Yeah, well, they think you've come to
to take him away. And I hope that isn't true.
take who away?
him! Col. kurtz.
these are all his children, man, as far as you can see.
hell, man, out here we're all his children.
could we talk to Col. kurtz?
Hey, man. You don't talk to the colonel.
well, you listen to him.
the man's enlarged my mind.
he's a poet warrior in the classic sense.
I mean, sometimes he'll--Well, you say hello to him, right?
he'll just walk by you and he won't even notice you.
then suddenly he'll grab you and he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say...
'do you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'?
if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming you.
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you. "
I'm a little man. I'm a little man. He's a great man.
I should have been a pair of ragged claws...
scuttling across floors of silent seas. "
I mean-- -Stay with the boat.
don't go any--Don't go without me, okay?
I wanna get a picture.
he can be terrible and he can be mean...
and he can be right.
he's fiIghting the war.
he's a great man.
I mean
I wish I had words, you know. I wish I had words.
I could tell you something like, the other day he wanted to kill me.
something like that.
why'd he want to kill you?
because I took his picture.
he said, " If you take my picture again...
I'm gonna kill you. "
and he meant it.
see, just lay cool. Lay cool. Lay back. Dig it.
he gets friendly again. He really does.
but you don't--you don't--you don't judge the colonel.
you don't judge the colonel like an ordinary man.
okay, watch it now. These are Americans. Americans!
you can feel the vibe of this place.
let me take your picture.
Hey, could you hold--Hey, hello. Hello.
could you hold up a minute?
Colby.
the heads.
you're looking at the heads.
I, uh--Sometimes he goes too far.
he's the fiIrst one to admit it.
he's gone crazy. -Wrong, wrong!
if you could have heard the man just two days ago
if you could have heard him then, God
you were gonna call him crazy? -Fucking A!
I just wanna talk to him.
well, man, he's gone away.
he's gone away.
he disappeared out in the jungle with his people.
I'll wait for him.
he feels comfortable with his people.
he forgets himself with his people.
he forgets himself.
captain?
maybe we should wait back at the boat.
I think you should-- -Okay, Chef.
we'll go back to the boat for a while.
Yeah, stay with Lance.
this colonel guy, he's wacko, man.
he's worse than crazy. He's evil!
I mean, that's what the man's got set up here, man!
it's fucking pagan idolatry. Look around you!
shit, he's loco. -Then you'll help me?
fucking A, I'll help you.
I'll do anything to get out of this joint.
good boy.
we could blow all them assholes away.
they're so fucking spaced out, they wouldn't even know it.
I ain't afraid of fucking skulls and altars and shit.
I used to think if I died in an evil place...
then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to Heaven.
but now, fuck
I mean, I don't care where it goes, as long as it ain't here.
so what do you wanna do? I'll kill the fuck.
get out of here.
I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around, check the place out.
see if I can fiInd the colonel, okay?
well, what do you want me to do?
here. You take the radio...
and if I don't get back by 2200 hours...
you call in the air strike.
'air strike? "
the code is " Almighty " ...
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-four-seven-one-two.
it's all in there.
everything I saw told me that kurtz had gone insane.
the place was full of bodies
north Vietnamese, Vietcong, Cambodians.
if I was still alive, it was because he wanted me that way.
it smelled like slow death in there
Malaria...and nightmares.
this was the end of the river, all right.
where are you from, Willard?
I'm from Ohio, sir.
were you born there?
Yes, sir.
whereabouts?
toledo, sir.
how far are you from the river?
the Ohio River, sir?
about 200 miles.
I went down that river once when I was a kid.
there's a place in the river--I can't remember
must've been a gardenia plantation or a flower plantation at one time.
it's all wild and overgrown now. But for about
for about fiIve miles you'd think that...
heaven just fell on the earth...
in the form of gardenias.
have you ever considered...
any real freedoms?
freedoms from the opinion of others?
even the opinions of yourself?
did they say why, Willard?
why they wanted to terminate my command?
I was sent on a classifiIed mission, sir.
it's no longer classifiIed, is it?
what did they tell you?
they told me...that you had gone...
totally insane...
and that your methods were unsound.
are my methods unsound?
I don't see any method...
at all, sir.
I expected...someone like you.
what did you expect?
are you an assassin?
I'm a soldier.
you're neither.
you're an errand boy sent by grocery clerks...
to collect the bill.
why, huh?
why would a nice guy like you wanna kill a genius?
feeling pretty good, huh?
Why?
do you know
do you know that the man
the man really likes you?
he likes you. He really likes you.
but he's got something in mind for you.
aren't you curious about that?
I'm curious.
I'm very curious.
are you curious?
there's something happening out here, man.
you know something, man. I know something that you don't know.
that's right, Jack.
the man is clear in his mind...
but his soul is mad.
Oh, yeah.
he's dying, I think.
he hates all this. He hates it.
but the man's
he reads poetry out loud, all right?
and a voice
a voice
he likes you 'cause you're still alive.
he's got plans for you.
no, no, I'm not gonna help you. You're gonna help him, man.
you're gonna help him.
I mean, what are they gonna say, man, when he's gone, huh?
cause he dies when it dies, man. When it dies, he dies.
what are they gonna say about him? What are they gonna say?
he was a kind man?
he was a wise man? He had plans? He had wisdom?
bullshit, man!
am I gonna be the one that's gonna set them straight?
look at me. Wrong!
you.
almost eight hours.
I'm asleep.
I'm asleep and dreaming I'm on this shitty boat.
fuck.
has it been eight hours?
hello. Almighty. Almighty.
this is PBR Street Gang. Radio check. Over.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty standing by. Over.
Oh, Jesus!
Oh, Christ!

'the War on the Horizon.
the American people may fiInd it hard to believe...
that the US is winning the war in Vietnam.
Nevertheless...
one of the most exhaustive inquiries...
into the status of the conflict yet compiled...
offers considerable evidence that the weight of US power...
two-and-a-half years after the big buildup began...
is beginning to make itself felt.
white House offiIcials maintain the impact of that strength...
may bring the enemy to the point where he could...
simply be unable to continue fiIghting. "
is this familiar?
'because Lyndon Johnson fears that the US public...
is in no mood to accept its optimistic conclusions...
he may never permit the report to be released in full.
even so, he is suffiIciently impressed with the fiIndings...
and suffiIciently anxious to make their conclusions known...
to permit experts who have been working on it...
to talk about it in general terms. "
no date, Time magazine.
'Sir Robert Thompson...
who led the victory over Communist guerillas in Malaya...
is now a RAND corporation consultant...
recently returned to Vietnam to sound out the situation for President Nixon.
he told the president last week...
that things felt much better...
and smelled much better over there. "
how do they smell to you, soldier?
you'll be free. You'll be under guard.
read these at your leisure.
don't lose them.
don't try to escape. You'll be shot.
we can talk of these things later.

alas, our dried voices when we whisper together...
are quiet and meaningless as wind in dry grass...
or a rat's feet over broken glass in a dry cellar.
he's really out there.
he is really there.
shape without form...
shade without color...
paralyzed force...
gesture without motion. "
do you know what the man's saying?
do you?
this is dialectics.
it's very simple dialectics.
it's one through nine. No maybes, no supposes, no fractions.
you can't travel in space.
you can't go out into space, you know...
without like, you know, with fractions.
what are you gonna land on? One-quarter? Three-eighths?
what are you gonna do when you go from here to Venus?
that's dialectic physics, okay.
dialectic logic is, there's only love and hate.
you either love somebody or you hate them.
mutt!
you mutt.
this is the way the fucking world is.
look at this fucking shit we're in, man!
not with a bang. A whimper.
and with a whimper,
I'm fucking splitting, Jack.
on the river,
I thought that the minute I looked at him...
I'd know what to do.
but it didn't happen.
I was in there with him for days.
not under guard.
I was free.
but he knew I wasn't going anywhere.
he knew more about what I was going to do than I did.
if the generals backin Nha Trang could see what I saw...
would they still want me to kill him?
more than ever, probably.
and what would his people back home want if they ever learned...
just how far from them he'd really gone?
he broke from them...
and then he broke from himself.
I'd never seen a man so broken up and...
ripped apart.
I've seen the horrors
horrors that you've seen.
but you have no right to call me a murderer.
you have a right to kill me.
you have a right to do that.
but you have no right to judge me.
it's impossible for words...
to describe...
what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means.
horror.
horror has a face.
and you must make a friend of horror.
horror and moral terror...
are your friends.
if they are not...
then they are enemies to be feared.
they are truly enemies.
I remember when I was with Special Forces.
seems a thousand centuries ago.
we went into a camp to inoculate...
some children.
we'd left the camp...
after we had inoculated the children for polio.
and this old man came running after us, and he was crying.
he couldn't say.
we went back there...
and they had come and hacked off...
every inoculated arm.
there they were, in a pile
a pile of...
little arms.
and I remember...
I-I--I cried. I wept like...
some grandmother.
I wanted to tear my teeth out.
I didn't know what I wanted to do.
and I want to remember it. I never want to forget it.
I never want to forget.
and then I realized...
like I was shot
like I was shot with a diamond
a diamond bullet right through my forehead.
and I thought, " My God, the genius of that.
the genius. "
the will to do that.
perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.
and then I realized...
they were stronger than me because they could stand it.
these were not monsters. These were men
trained cadres.
these men who fought with their hearts...
who have families, who have children...
who are fiIlled with love...
that they had the strength
the strength...
to do that.
if I had ten divisions of those men...
then our troubles here would be over very quickly.
you have to have men...
who are moral...
and at the same time...
who are able to...
utilize their primordial instincts to kill...
without feeling, without passion...
without judgment--without judgment.
because it's judgment that defeats us.
I worry that my son...
might not understand what I've tried to be.
and if I were to be killed, Willard...
I would want someone to go to my home...
and tell my son everything.
everything I did. Everything you saw.
because there's nothing that I detest more than...
the stench of lies.
and if you understand me, Willard, you
you will do this for me.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty. Over.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty standing by. Over.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty standing by.
how do you copy?
they were gonna make me a major for this...
and I wasn't even in their fucking army anymore.
everybody wanted me to do it.
him most of all.
I felt like he was up there...
waiting for me to take the pain away.
he just wanted to go out like a soldier...
standing up.
not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade.
even the jungle wanted him dead.
and that's who he really took his orders from anyway.
we train young men to drop fiIre on people...
but their commanders...
won't allow them to write " fuck " ...
on their airplanes because...
it's obscene.
the horror.
the horror.
calling PBRStreet Gang.
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty.
do you read me? Over.
PBRStreet Gang?
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty
the horror.
the horror.
merry Christmas！ -Merry Christmas！
penguin sighting! Man or myth?
what is he? Today's edition-- another penguin sighting.
another penguin sighting! Check it out!
penguin man living in Gotham's sewers! Read all about the latest sighting!
may I have your attention, Gotham City?
it is time for tonight's lighting of the tree.
how about that?
part man, part penguin! All horrifying!
find out for only 50 cents! Come on!
read about the possible terror beneath our feet! Check it out!
read about it!
missing link between man and bird.
my dear boy sometimes it's a diversion to read such rubbish.
usually, it's a waste of time.
whatever. Today's issue! "The Penguin: Man or myth?"
the Globe! Right here! 25 cents!
well, here's hoping.
with luck, Gotham will have its first merry Christmas in years.
I feel almost vulgar at Yuletide mentioning the new power plant.
but if we're to break ground when we must, I'll need permits, variances, tax incentives. That sort of pesky nonsense.
power plant?
studies show we've enough power to get us into the middle of the next century.
your analysts foresee growth at 1% per annum. That's a mild swelling.
imagine a Gotham City of the future, lit up like a blanket of stars,
but blinking on and off, embarrassingly low on juice.
frankly, I cringe, Mr. Mayor.
sorry, any plans must go to the usual committees through the usual channels.
I have a suggestion.
well , actually, really, just more like a question.
I'm afraid we haven't properly housebroken Ms. Kyle.
in the plus column, though she makes great coffee.
dad.
Mr. Mayor. Time to go down and bring joy to the masses.
"actually, more of a question.'
you stupid corn dog.
corn dog, corn dog.
I have enough signatures from Shreck employees to warrant a recall.
that's not a threat, just simple numbers.
maybe. But you sure as hell don't have an issue or a candidate.
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
from those of us at City Hall to each and every one of you happy holidays.
we have with us a man who needs no introduction, he's given us so much.
please welcome Gotham's own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.
pick up those contracts for Personnel and pick up the dry cleaning and paper towels .
darn!
I forgot my speech.
remind me to take it out on what's-her-name.
Santa Claus?
afraid not.
I'm just a poor schmo. Got lucky.
sue me if I want to give some back.
I only wish I could hand out more than just expensive baubles.
I wish I could hand out world peace and unconditional love, wrapped in a big bow.
Oh, but you can.
Oh, but you will.
merry Christmas.
great idea.
not mine.
what are you waiting for? The signal!
we want the big guy! The guy who runs the show!
what do you want?
not you!
Shreck!
you'll have to go through me.
dad, go! Save yourself!
dad, go!
shut up!
take one step closer, Mr. Manbat, and I'll...
you missed.
the Batman.
or is it just '"Batman'"?
your choice, of course.
well, that was very brief.
just like all the men in my life.
what men?
well , then again, there's you. But you need therapy.
thanks for saving the day, Batman. The Circus Gang is back.
we'll see.
they almost made off with our mover and shaker, Max Shreck.
where is that insufferable son of a bitch?
I believe the word you're looking for is ...
actually, this is all just a bad dream.
you're at home in bed heavily sedated, resting comfortably dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed
in a lifetime of profiteering.
tragic irony or poetic justice?
you tell me.
my God, it's true.
penguin Man of the sewer.
odd as it may seem, Max, you and I have something in common:
we're both perceived as monsters.
but somehow you're a well-respected monster,
and I am, to date not!
frankly, I feel that's a bum rap. I'm a businessman.
tough, yes.
shrewd, okay. But that does not make me a monster.
don't embarrass yourself, Max!
I know all about you.
what you hide, I discover.
what you put in your toilet, I place on my mantle. Get the picture?
is that supposed to hypnotize me?
no, just give you a splitting headache.
it's not working.
Oh, you big baby!
just blanks.
would I go through all this trouble just to kill you?
no, Max.
I have an entirely other purpose.
I'm ready, Max.
I've been down here too long.
it's time for me to ascend to re-emergy with your help, your know-how, your savvy.
I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.
I come from Iike you.
and, like you, I want some respect! A recognition of my basic humanity.
but most of all I want to find out who I am by finding my parents, Iearning my human name
simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted!
and exactly why am I going to help you?
well, let's start.
let's see what we have in here.
a batch of toxic waste from your clean textile plant!
there's a whole lagoon of this crud in the back!
it could have come from anywhere.
what about the documents that prove you own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?
if there were such documents that's not an admission, they would've been shredded.
good idea.
a lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.
by the way how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?
Fred?
Fred's actually I believe he's on an extended vacation. He's good.
good.
Hiya, Max. Remember me? I'm Fred's hand!
want to greet any other body parts?
remember, Max you flush it, I flaunt it.
you know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?
I think, perhaps I could help orchestrate a '"Welcome Home'" scenario for you.
once we're both back home, perhaps we could help each other.
you won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
honey, I'm home!
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.
miss Kitty.
back from more sexual escapades you refuse to share?
not that I'd ever pry.
drink your dinner.
what?
how can anyone be so pathetic?
Yes, to you I seem pathetic, but I'm a working girl.
must pay the rent. Maybe if you chipped in instead of stepping out.
Selina, dear, it's your mother. Just calling to say hello.
Yeah, but I'm disappointed you're not coming home for Christmas.
I want to discuss why you insist on languishing in Gotham City as some lowly secretary.
lowly assistant.
Selina, about that Christmas getaway we planned
I'll be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need to be my own person, not an appendage.
some appendage!
the party never stops on Selina Kyle's answering machine.
I should've let him win that last racquetball game.
hello Selina Kyle.
we're calling to tell you about exciting, new Gotham Lady perfume.
it makes women feel like women and the men have no complaints either.
this is yourself reminding you to come all the way back to the office if you forgot the Bruce Wayne file.
you stupid corn dog!
working late?
I'm just boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.
I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment. I even opened the protected files.
how industrious!
how did you open the protected files?
may I ask?
I figured your password was '"Geraldo,'" your Chihuahua, and it was.
this is all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side about how the power plant is a power plant in name only.
since, in fact, it's going to be a big, giant capacitor.
and, instead of generating power, it'll be sucking power from Gotham City and storing it, stockpiling it.
which is a very novel approach, I'd say.
who'd you say this to?
nobody.
what did curiosity do to the cat?
I'm no cat.
I'm just an assistant, a secretary.
and a very good one.
too good?
listen it's our secret. Honest.
how can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
this power plant is my legacy. It's what I leave behind for Chip.
nothing must prevent that.
go ahead. Intimidate me. Bully me, if it makes you feel big.
it's not like you can kill me!
actually, it's a lot like that.
for a second, you really frightened me.
Really?
honey, I'm home!
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.
Selina, this is your mother. Call me.
Selina, this is your mother. Why haven't you called me back?
Hello, Selina Kyle.
we're just calling to make sure you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.
one whiff of this and your boss will ask you to stay after work for a candlelight staff meeting for two.
Gotham Lady perfume. Exclusively at Shreck's department store.
I don't know about you, Miss Kitty, but I feel so much yummier.
ladies and gentlemen:
I stand before you again to denounce the urban chaos we live with in our city.
it's got to stop.
it's going to stop! Our community is coming apart in a season when it should be coming together.
I don't care what the cynics may say. This is the Christmas season and should be a healing time.
I say that not only as an official
but as a husband and a father.
last night's violence won't happen again.
I'm not good at speeches, so I'll just say "Thanks."
it's the hideous Penguin Man.
take the baby. Just don't hurt me, please!
this was the remarkable scene only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.
the mysterious Penguin saving the life of the mayor's baby and announcing his presence.
all I want in return is a chance to find my mom and dad.
a chance to find out who they are and thusly who I am.
and then with my parents try to understand why they did what I guess they felt they had to do who was born a little different.
a child who spent his first Christmas and many since in a sewer.
Mr. Wayne? Something wrong?
his parents.
this scene, direct from Gotham Plaza.
I hope he finds them.
here he is, standing alongside Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck.
how about a statement? People want to know.
penguin's not to be disturbed! -It's a public place!
walk. Now. Move. -Freedom of the press!
wait a minute.
what about the freedom to rediscover your roots with dignity and privacy?
is the Penguin a personal friend?
he's a personal friend of the whole city, so have a heart.
give the Constitution a rest. It's Christmas.
red Triangle Circus put on a swell show with fierce lions.
circus returns for a two-week .
kids will love.
Thanks.
it's cold!
it's vichyssoise.
it's supposed to be cold.
circus is back with a freak show, may not be suitable for kids:
featuring a poodle lady,
the world's fattest man,
and Aquatic Bird Boy.
why are you determined to prove that this Penguin is not what he seems?
must you be the only lonely '"man-beast'" in town?
the circus folded its tents yesterday after reports of missing children in several towns.
police have closed down the Red Triangle fairgrounds.
however, at least one freak-show performer vanished before he could be questioned.
I suppose you feel better now.
no. Actually, I feel worse.
Why're you still out?
are you concerned about that strange, heroic Penguin person?
I think he knows who his parents are.
there's something else.
Mr. Penguin,
a penguin is a bird that cannot fly!
I am a man!
I have a name!
Oswald Cobblepot!
you'll never be able to settle with them?
true.
I was their "Number-One"" son,
and they treated me like number two.
but it's human nature to fear the unusual.
perhaps when I held my Tiffany baby rattle with a shiny flipper instead of five chubby digits, they freaked.
but I forgive them.
penguin forgives parents! I'm at peace with myself and the world!
don't need hands as long as you got heart.
my heart is filled with love. I feel five feet tall.
he's like a frog that became a prince. -No, he's more like a penguin.
now, now, pretty little thing.
nice and easy.
I love a big, strong man who's not afraid to show it with someone half his size.
be gentle, it's my first time.
tic-tac-toe.
you make it easy, don't you?
always waiting for some Batman to save you.
I am Catwoman hear me roar.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
good time. Everyone but the bandits'll be slacking off till after the New Year.
I'm not sure I like the inference.
I didn't realize I made one.
I'm pushing this power plant now because it'll cost more later.
a million saved is a million earned.
I commissioned this report. Take a look at it.
Gotham City has a power surplus. I'm sure you know that.
my question is:
what's your angle?
"power surplus?" Bruce, shame on you!
no such thing. One can never have too much power.
if my life has a meaning, that's the meaning.
I'll fight you. I've already spoken to the mayor and we agree.
mayors come and go.
blue bloods tire easily.
can you go 15 rounds with Muhammad Shreck?
I guess we'll find out.
of course, I don't have a crime boss like Cobblepot in my corner.
"crime boss?" Shows what you know
'mr. To-The-Manor-Born- With-A-Silver-Spoon，
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.
if his parents hadn't 86'ed him, you'd have been bunkies at prep school.
he controls the Red Triangle Gang. I can't prove it yet, but we both...
I'll not stand for mud-slinging here.
if my assistant was here, she'd have already escorted you out anywhere he wants.
preferably some nightspot grotto or secluded hideaway.
nice suit.
that's my name, don't wear it out or I'll make you buy me a new one.
this is Bruce.
Wayne.
we've met.
have we?
no, I'm sorry. I mistook me for somebody else.
you mean, "mistook me."
isn't that what I said?
I don't think so.
what happened?
did you hurt yourself on that ski slope?
is that why you cut short your vacation? Came back?
it's a blur.
not complete amnesia. I remember Sister Mary Margaret puking in church and Betsy saying it was morning sickness.
and the time I forgot to wear my underpants to school.
and the name of the boy who noticed was Ricky Friedburg.
he's dead now.
but last night complete blur.
couldn't you just die?
please show out Mr. Wayne.
with pleasure.
your coat, Mr. Wayne.
you don't seem like the type who does business with Shreck.
no. You don't seem like the type to take orders from him.
well, that's a Iong story.
I could free up some time.
I'm listed. I'm tempted.
I'm working.
I'm leaving.
you buy that blurry business?
women.
nothing surprises me
except your late mother.
who'd have thought Selina had a brain to damage?
bottom line?
she tries to blackmail me, I'll drop her out of a higher window.
meantime I've got badder fish to fry.
Oswald it's Max.
you're home?
How've you been?
your extended family?
good to have a family.
I'd rather not be disturbed now.
come on downstairs, Oswald. I have a surprise.
I don't like surprises.
come on.
don't peek.
you'll spoil it.
adulation is a cross to bear. God knows I know.
but someone's got to supplant our standing in the way of progress, Mayor.
and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic.
your charisma's bigger than both of us. Come on down.
mayor?
mayor.
elections happen in November. It's late December.
don't worry.
I want you to meet Jen and Josh, my image consultants.
here.
reclaim your birthright.
I'm Jen.
okay, let's see. What I'd like to do first is put these gloves on you.
our research tells us that voters like fingers.
so if we were to just lose this
we'll do it another time.
not a lot of reflective surfaces in the sewer, huh?
still, it could be worse.
my nose could be gushing blood.
what do you mean by that?
everybody, back to work!
let's make a mayor!
you're right, we missed the regular election
but elected officials can be recalled, impeached given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew.
then think of you Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.
I'd like to fill her void.
we'll need signatures to overturn the ballot. I can supply those.
teach her my French flipper trick. We need one more thing.
a platform?
stop global warming. Start global cooling. Make the world an icebox.
I like it. But to get the mayor recalled, we must have a catalyst.
you're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot.
your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot.
l need you, Oswald. I need you now!
that's the biggest parasol I've ever seen.
soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin, or the Reichstag fire .
you want my old friends up there to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy?
exactly. -Sounds fun.
but I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.
I have my own things to tend to.
"Sidetracked?'" This is your chance to fulfill your destiny
that your parents carelessly discarded.
reclaim my birthright, you mean?
imagine, as mayor, you have the ear of the media,
access to the captains of industry,
unlimited poontang.
you drive a hard bargain, Maxie.
all right, I'll be mayor.
burn, baby, burn!
who is she? -What is she?
I don't know whether to open fire or fall in love.
you poor guys.
always confusing your pistols with your privates.
don't hurt us. Our take-home's less than $300.
you're overpaid. Hit the road.
go ahead and hit me.
admiring your handiwork?
touring the riot scene.
gravely assessing the devastation.
"Upstanding-Mayor'" stuff.
you're not the mayor.
things change.
what do you want?
the direct approach.
I admire that in a man with a mask.
you don't really think you'll win, do you?
things change.
I saw her first. Got to fly.
how could you? I'm a woman!
I'm sorry.
as I was saying, I'm a woman and can't be taken for granted.
life's a bitch, now so am l.
who are you?
who's the man behind the bat?
maybe you can help me find the woman behind the cat.
no, that's not you.
there you are.
saved by Kitty Litter.
bastard!
alfred bring me some antiseptic ointment.
coming. Are you in pain, sir?
not really.
I may have saved the mayor's baby
but I refuse to save a mayor who stood by, helpless as a baby while Gotham was ravaged by a disease，
that turned Eagle Scouts into crazed clowns
and happy homemakers into catwomen.
thank you.
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast, made his bid to run Gotham.
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest role model a young person could have.
and you're the hottest young person a role model could have.
here.
wear a button.
let me just get it on here.
thank you.
this mayor stuff is not about power, it's about reaching out to people, touching people, groping people.
Penguin-- -My name is not Penguin!
it's Oswald Cobblepot.
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.
just the pussy I've been looking for.
it's chilly in here.
I'll warm you.
down, Oswald.
we need to talk.
you see you and I have something in common.
sounds familiar.
appetite for destruction?
contempt for the czars of fashion?
wait, don't tell me.
naked sexual charisma?
Batman.
the thorn in both our sides.
the fly in our ointment.
ointment?
I've got scented and unscented.
I'll come back later.
perchance, are you a registered voter? I'm a mayoral prospect.
I have but one pet cause today!
ban the Bat.
Oh, him again. No bother. He's already history. Check it out.
we'll disassemble his Batmobile and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.
he'd have even more power as a martyr.
to destroy Batman, we must first turn him into what he hates the most.
namely, us.
frame him?
not even in office yet and already an enemies list.
Earl's done good by us. Real good.
Earl was doing fine without you.
Carlito, you don't train your pet nigger before you let him out of the house?
why don't you go fuck your dead mother?
Artie.
fuck.
motherfucker!
[grunting]
Hey, tough guy Reggie, you're a big shot.
[People clamoring]
take it easy. Relax.
I'll kill you, you nigger. I'll fucking kill you.
please, everybody, just calm down. Please, relax. Calm down.
can I get somebody in here to help with this here?
relax. Just relax. Relax.
ladies, keep dancing. Smiles, ladies, smiles.
let me just clean this up. Can I have someone in here, please?
I'll help you. Just one minute. That's fine.
[Panting]
Hey, Jerry.
listen, do me a favor.
send a dozen bottles of the best champagne over to Artie's table.
let me have the whole check.
also, see if you can get ahold of Rocco...
tell him to get his ass over here. It's an emergency.
you got it, Carlito. Thank you.
[inaudible]
fuck me.
come here, baby. Reggie gonna show you something.
drop dead.
let's get the fuck out of here. Reggie.
being here is the only reason why you're not full of bullet holes.
we're gonna wait for Artie and his boys to split.
we're gonna make a move out the back.
that could take an hour, two hours, or three fucking days.
but we ain't moving from this spot till they gone.
you got to take a leak, do it in that fucking glass.
I got a piece right in my sock...
waste all them guinea motherfuckers.
Hey, Reggie, your brother, me, and Rocco...
we're in business with those guys. Deep.
you were way out of line.
motherfucker called me a nigger and I'm out of line?
you wouldn't shake the man's hand, Reggie.
he sends champagne, comes over to your table...
you treat him like a fucking hump.
for 30 years, man, we've been at war in Harlem...
blacks, Ricans and ltalians.
so here, me, Rocco, and Earl put something together...
and you want to mess it all up? That ain't right.
what do you think you doing?
putting up schools and nursing homes?
you motherfuckers are heroin dealers.
Reggie, time to make a move.
come on. All right, all right.
where are we going? Yo, go back and get that chick.
[Laughing]
Oh, lookie who's here!
Carlito, you buy us all those drinks.
you ain't got to leave out the back door.
Reggie fucked up, all right. I apologize.
you ain't got to answer to us. He does.
what are you doing? Get the fuck off.
what do we got here? Little black motherfucker.
we're gonna let you go, Carlito. But first you gonna watch this.
Artie, that's Earl's brother, Artie.
well, Earl's brother just said his last words.
cause I'm gonna cut his fucking tongue out. -You can't do that, Artie.
open his mouth.
[Groaning]
Artie! Fuck my mother?
huh?
you spit in my face?
who the fuck are you?
[Screaming]
Artie!
[Car tires screeching]
[Car door closing] Artie! Wait!
[Reggie panting]
let him go. All right, he's a piece of shit, but let us take care of him.
look, you know how much money we're gonna lose without Earl?
don't wreck our business over this.
you better fucking take care of this, Rocco. You understand me?
you better fucking take care of this.
let's go.
[men mumbling]
[Reggie coughing]
[Panting]
he just went at it with Artie. Over nothing.
[siren wailing]
they would've killed him.
who am I gonna leave my policy business to?
Clyde's your copilot.
Clyde ain't family. Yeah, who is?
you two family. Charlie doesn't want it.
you give it to me, Artie gets involved.
you'll never see another nickel.
Clyde's all right, man.
I want to propose a toast to my successor, Clyde.
I've been in business with this man for 1 2 years...
he took over, and now he fired my ass.
cause you come to work late every day.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
and I want to propose another toast...
to my brothers of other colors, from other mothers...
my two best friends in the whole world Rocco, Carlito。
I love you and I'm gonna miss you.
[People clapping] I'm gonna miss all of you guys.
we're gonna have the wedding right there on the beach.
you two are coming, right? -Like we have a choice.
fuck you, man. No, I want you to stay for a while.
it's a whole different vibe, man. I mean, slow, cool.
it's like, peaceful.
forget about it, Earl.
they're sending motherfuckers to the moon.
you don't think they can lock you two up?
Earl, we love you.
but we're not moving to the West lndies with you.
I'll see you on Christmas.
so, what time is your flight? -6: 30.
come on, man, one last drink.
me and the lady gonna stop for breakfast before we get on the flight.
breakfast? You just had dinner.
catch you at the beach, man.
Rocco.
get out of here, man.
[Car engine starting]
what do you think?
if you was me, would you throw in the towel and follow Earl down to paradise?
Yes. And I would take me with you.
I'd take you, too.
can't a man have a quiet drink in this motherfucker without you pushing a mop in his face?
fuck!
Charlie, if you don't mind, we'll drop Leticia off at home...
you can get Reggie out of here.
you got it.
now that Earl's gone, you make sure we never see him again.
you know, ain't got nobody to blame but yourself that Earl passed you up.
you could've had the whole policy bank,
but you just wouldn't straighten your ass out.
fuck Earl and fuck you!
y'all ain't nothing but Rocco's niggers.
know what, Reggie? Walk your ass home.
it's freezing out here, man.
hop the bus.
you hung around close to a year, you ain't learned shit,
you made no friends, no contacts.
all you do is go to black pride meetings, drink all night, and chase whores.
last time I checked, Malcolm X was a Muslim scholar.
no pork, no booze, no pussy.
prayed five times a day and wore a bow tie.
you don't know nothing about me.
a punk is a fucking punk, Reggie, black, white, Puerto Rican or Chinese.
the only reason why you're allowed to walk the streets is your brother.
he's gone now.
so you better go home, lock yourself in, and stay there.
I'm gonna tune you up one day, Carlito.
one day? Why wait, motherfucker?
if you're gonna make a move, make a move right now.
walk, Reggie.
cause next time I see you, it's gonna be bad.
[Car door opening]
[Car door closing]
[Car engine starting]
come on, Eddie. You can't shut down early on me.
it's 5: 30 in the morning, Carlito.
where you gotta go? Your wife can't stand your ass.
Yeah, yeah. Come on, have a drink with me. I'm buying.
why do you always do this to me, Carlito?
come on, Eddie. You know how much I love you.
when I die, I'm gonna leave you everything.
[gun firing]
[Groaning]
[gasping]
I warned you to stay away from my sister, Carlito.
all right? I warned you.
Oh, shit. Carlito!
somebody shot Carlito.
[respirator whistling]
[clanking]
we were successful in removing both bullets.
Mr. Brigante was lucky. No vital organs were damaged.
listen, Doc, if you need any more of my blood, I'm ready.
we're okay.
[Laughs]
can I talk to you for a second?
it's probably not a good idea for you to be here. All right?
I'll call you when Charlie wants to see you.
[sobbing]
private room. Not too shabby.
[whistling]
you must have 99 lives.
what can I do for you gentlemen?
tell you the truth we came by to see if there's anything we could do for you.
maybe let you flip through some mug shots.
I didn't even see the guy.
snuck up from behind me. Next thing I know, bang-bang.
must have been after my wallet.
we figured your goombah pals might have been getting sick
and treid of whacking up all those dividends.
[sighing]
we're gonna make a little deal with you, Carlito.
you give us Artie Bottolota, his son,
your little buddy Rocco, and the rest of the Pleasant Avenue crew...
and we won't start breaking your balls on a daily basis.
you got nothing to break my balls about.
I'm in the music business, fellas.
Carlito Brigante is a taxpaying citizen just like everybody else.
every jackass in East Harlem is stumbling around trying to suck his own dick.
on account of what you and your pals are putting on the street.
now, for old times' sake...
we gonna let you grab your little piggy bank and fly away somewhere.
but you are gonna hand us everybody.
otherwise, you're going down with them.
feel better？
Hey, Carlito, you mind if I bring these home for my wife?
it's our anniversary. Knock yourself out.
[Mrs. Diaz speaking Spanish]
Carlito, please!
I beg you. Nobody is gonna get hurt.
Carlito. It's all right.
you know, if you had a brain in your head,
you would've took off and gone back to Puerto Rico already.
some hotshot off the street gonna come in here...
think he doing me a favor and light this joint up.
everybody gotta split town.
buy the ticket. Catch that plane, and never come back.
otherwise your parents gonna be using that money for your funeral.
[siren wailing]
I'm staying here, Carlito. No.
you're going with them.
you got to take care of your pops. -No.
in a while we get back together. -No.
you have to go, all right?
it's not safe for you here.
every day, I want you to remember one thing:
you still alive 'cause of me.
you call and let me have your address when you get settled.
I'll come down and see you.
do you promise?
of course.
[sobbing] I love you, Carlito.
I love you, too.
[sighing]
no, Leticia.
no, Leticia, no!
[crying]
[Speaking Spanish]
[Screaming]
get in the trunk, you fat fuck.
Hey, I got a gun on you, motherfucker. -All right.
what the fuck！
[Groaning]
[All grunting]
Hey, Artie, take a look at this.
[Grunts]
[Panting]
Artie, you forgot to take out the goddamn garbage. Artie.
Hey, hey!
what the fuck are you doing? Get off him!
Hey! Artie. Artie! Artie!
[trunk slamming]
[Car engine starting]
[tires screeching]
[Doorbell ringing]
anything new?
how do we know it was Reggie?
Artie's wife said three black guys snatched him.
that don't mean nothing.
I listened in on the ransom call. It was him.
anybody besides you figure that out?
when Artie comes home they will.
[Scoffs]
maybe we get lucky, Reggie buries him in a fucking ditch.
[Clears throat]
how you doing, Artie?
we paid the money. $2 million cash over an hour ago.
I made the drop. No tail. No stakeout.
we did exactly what they said.
you think they'd kill my son?
no, no, Artie. Why would they do that?
[clock ticking]
[sighing]
[Phone ringing]
hello.
we finished counting all the cash.
good. I wanted you to have it with no problems.
it's $20 short.
huh?
so fuck you very much.
I'm killing this guinea cocksucker.
wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[gun firing]
[SCREAMS]
wait! What happened?
[Woman crying]
[Laughing]
[grunting]
[Panting]
april fools, motherfucker.
[sobbing]
I don't know if I can do this funeral without a body.
you need a body? I'll get you a body.
[banging on door]
[Woman sniffling]
Artie boy.
[exclaims]
[Laughing]
[All laughing]
you guys must have prayed hard for us.
I never thought I'd live to see old man Bottolota throw a hug around this Puerto Rican.
it was about two minutes before the other shoe came crashing down like a safe.
you motherfuckers was in on it.
Artie, Charlie wouldn't be here if that were true.
you shut your mouth, Rocco!
if we was in on it,
we would have had Reggie kill you, don't you think?
they left me there to suffocate in that fucking trunk!
if the cops didn't drive by, I'd still be in there turning fucking blue!
enough!
maybe you was in on it, maybe you wasn't.
but Rocco brought you around us,
and then the both of you brought those fucking niggers around.
so you're responsible.
I'm putting Nacho Reyes on you.
worked with me in Cuba. Did more hits than all my guys together.
I'm giving him contracts on you, Rocco, and Earl.
and the only way they're gonna be canceled is if I find three dead niggers on my doorstep.
and my $2 million back in my pocket.
[speaks Spanish]
[Music playing on radio]
[sighing]
how is the food in this joint?
this is a bar. They don't got food here.
I'm talking to you, pendejo?
I'm fucking talking to you?
[inhaling]
[snorting]
Carlito.
I got a contract to kill you.
pero...
I don't want to do that.
so we gonna go, we gonna find those three fucking cocolo, okay?
[Speaking Spanish]
nacho Reyes.
first-degree stone killer from them old Batistá days.
nacho got himself a bad blow habit.
he only worked two hours a day.
nacho, I don't want them in the car.
rest of the time it's all party and poontang.
man, you think I cover for that crazy fucking kid?
him come for me next.
Reggie was asked to leave our organization months ago.
he wanted to bomb police stations.
that's not what this movement's about.
we're about spreading progressive education for the uninformed,
not resorting to methods of violence. Why don't you come inside
come on, come on. Let's go have a fucking drink already.
at the rate we're going...
Reggie and his boys gonna die of old age.
and me and Rocco a lot sooner.
don't touch the car, please.
don't touch me. Don't be touching my shit.
Nicky, I'd never bother you with something like this,
but if we don't find them cats soon,
them crazy-ass ltalians are gonna come over,
and start shooting up the black side of Harlem.
[Laughs]
Carlito.
you don't find the motherfuckers that snatched Artie's kid,
you the one that's getting shot up.
Yeah, well that, too.
and far as them ltalians coming my way,
if one of them even set foot across Lenox Avenue,
next time you're gonna see a live guinea again is on the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
now I believe I've been very nice about this situation.
I let you and them set up across town from me.
I appreciate that.
because one day you and them wal-yos, you're gonna run out of dope.
and all them junkie motherfuckers you all done raised gonna come scurrying over to me,
Iike a bunch of starved cockroaches.
if we run out of dope, you run out of dope, too, Nicky.
I got me a safe house with over 3 tons of pure Persian.
that's enough to keep this city nodding for the next six months.
are a bunch of cracker-ass scumbags.
I'm gonna wear my best tux to those motherfuckers' funerals.
Nicky...
but I'm gonna do this for you, Carlito. And you gonna owe me.
I appreciate it.
you know, Nicky, l...
you have the most beautiful automobile I've seen in my life.
if I can just drive the car one time around the block...
papi, man, it would mean the world to me.
[snorting]
class-a Bolivian, man. Blow the fur right out that coat.
Carlito. How you doing?
there's two fuckup kids, never had a dime between them,
now they're throwing parties and driving new cars on 137th Street.
what's the address? Address?
you don't need an address.
I got them both in the trunk of my car.
[chattering in Spanish]
[Music playing]
[grunting]
Hey.
[Shad and Lee screaming]
come on, let's go.
[snorting]
guys telling me Reggie took off to Barbados to see his brother.
that's bullshit.
that kid ain't getting through customs with $2 million in cash.
no way, no how.
Mira, he got some girlfriend, lives in the Bronx.
21 Collins Avenue, Apartment 3A.
time to hit the Bronx.
time to drop off these guys to Artie first. Vamos.
you want to see something nice, Carlito?
here's your guy. Here's your guy, too. Carlito, take your guy.
here's some more of your guy.
come on.
[whooping]
[Nacho talking in Spanish]
did you see Artie's face when he opened the first bag, Carlito?
[Laughing]
Hey, Carlito, I ain't never gonna eat in that fucking joint again.
come on, let's go, Nacho. Nacho, come on.
here we go.
[guns cocking]
Earl, what the...
now you know I ain't had nothing to do with this bullshit.
Reggie called me talking about he want to come down to the island and hide out.
I took the first plane smoking. There's my ticket.
I landed this morning.
Carlito, don't listen to that fucking cocolo.
shut the fuck up.
Reggie, where's the money? Fuck you.
Puňeta, where's the money?
Reggie, tell them where the fucking money is.
just give it up and we'll let you walk.
nobody lettin' nobody walk.
[Nacho shouting in Spanish]
Reggie, there's six guys downstairs.
you kill us, you still ain't making it out this building.
tell me where the money is, we'll cook up a story for Artie and let you go.
Reggie, listen to him. This is your last out.
I'm supposed to believe that shit? -Listen to him!
I'm trying to help you out, Reggie. Fuck you, Carlito.
you said next time you see me gonna be bad.
you shouldn't have come looking then, because you dying first.
Reggie! Reggie!
[gun firing]
Earl.
just let me be, man, let me be.
come on, Carlito.
let's take this cocolo and put him on the meat hook.
he'll tell us where the money is.
he don't know where the money is, Nacho.
on the meat hook he will know.
he don't know nothing about no money, all right?
just tell Artie Earl never showed up.
you know I can't do that, Carlito.
walk away, Nacho! Just walk the fuck away!
Papito, don't forget, I got a contract for you, too.
kill me then. Kill us both.
if that's what I have to do, that's what I have to do.
well then, come on, motherfucker!
you want to go to hell? Let's all three go to fucking hell!
pull the fucking trigger!
[sighing]
Carlito, Carlito.
you listen to Nacho.
this loyalty that you have for your friends,
it's rare in this business.
but someday it's gonna get you killed.
Adios, Carlito.
Adios.
ain't nobody gonna find that money.
Reggie got it buried someplace.
you gotta get on the plane with me.
I do that, they kill Rocco-- They'll kill you and Rocco.
whether you give them the $2 million or not, you know that.
we all got to get on that fucking plane.
Rocco's got family here.
running gonna buy us some time...
but it ain't gonna buy us forever.
I do not give a shit if you knock over Fort Knox.
if I don't get my $2 million back before the week's out...
your testicles are gonna be jammed in your eye sockets.
you get that? In your fucking eye sockets!
how much you got stashed, Charlie? A little over $500, 000.
all right, I got $600, 000.
suppose we throw it together and make $1 million down payment to Artie...
tell him we'll get him the rest.
I wouldn't give Artie Bottolota a nickel for a fucking parking meter.
he should've kept his $2 mil, let Reggie whack Artie Jr.
like that there'd be one less scumbag hanging off the Bottolota family tree.
that's real insightful, Charlie. I'll let him know.
where you going? Someplace I can think.
make out my will.
now you figure, why not just whack Artie and his boys?
kill one of them wiseguys, gotta kill a hundred.
they just keep coming after you.
got to come up with that $2 mil, Jack.
$30 million? That's wholesale.
you start cutting the shit up, it's worth 10 times that. Maybe more.
you're gonna bring down Hollywood Nicky?
look, he's got 3 tons of pure uncut heroin stashed in his safe house.
Charlie, nobody knows where that is. I do.
Yeah, how's that? Earl told me a while back.
Earl?
you're trading tips from the nigger that probably ended up with my $2 million?
you know something, Carlito? Suck on this!
pops! Hold on!
listen. We clean out Hollywood Nicky...
that's the end of his business.
all them junkies come running over to you, Artie. You'll be the kingpin.
now you want to start a 10-year war between us and the blacks.
the ltalians ain't taking down Hollywood Nicky.
the Puerto Ricans are.
it's not a bad idea, Pop.
you don't like the idea, pull the trigger.
you ain't never gonna see your money again.
okay, now. The cut dope goes out in laundry trucks every day.
the new dope goes in the same way twice a week.
Tuesdays and Fridays. Noon sharp.
we gonna boost one of the delivery trucks like half a mile from here.
we're gonna whack the driver and make the delivery.
only instead of 50 keys of junk it's gonna be me Colorado and about 20 other guys.
there's just five armed guards that work inside that place. They're all relatives.
people Hollywood Nicky trusts.
all we gotta do is kill them all and take it all.
so, what do you think?
what do I think?
make the score.
should have been here two hours ago.
Yeah. That's 'cause Hollywood Nicky's throwing dirt over him by now.
now you can take care of the $2 million on your own.
[truck horn honking]
[gate opening]
that's some good shit.
Attaboy. You did great.
our cut should be half of what's there. Half?
you can have the whole thing. At wholesale.
$10, 000 a key.
[Laughing]
Artie, you got to be kidding me.
fuck you. Fuck you.
you two work for us.
get the spic squad in gear and start moving all that shit.
see you later, fellas.
[Laughing]
okay. To us. We're gonna be rich, Pop.
we're gonna be...
[crashing]
what the fuck is that? Motherfucker.
it's Hollywood Nicky!
[guns firing]
what the hell was that? -I don't know.
[police radio chattering]
[police siren wailing]
you want to go back? Are you crazy? Let's get out of here.
[sighing]
what's going on, fellas?
thought I had a flat.
it don't look flat.
heard on the radio they just found your boys up the road in that meatpacking house with about 10, 000 pounds of heroin.
they arrest wouldn't come everybody? -Peacefully.
now they're all getting measured for rubber bags.
mind if I check your trunk? -Be my guest.
what's this?
it's a whole lot of money.
$200, 000. $100, 000 in each bag.
[Grunts]
pleasure doing business with you, Carlito. Pleasure was all mine.
good luck, fellas.
you son of a bitch.
why, thank you, gentlemen.
no prisoners on this one, Jack. Just corpses.
[Chuckling]
you son of a bitch.
come on, Rocco, it's not like we turned into stools.
what? You ain't got a problem with us,
hiring a couple of cops to do a little killing on our behalf, do you?
$200, 000? That's a world record ever paid for a hit.
[All laughing]
let's get the fuck out of here.
big Jeff and Little Jeff wound up with a chest full of medals.
for taking out the whole Bottolota crew.
and the big war between Hollywood Nicky and the Puerto Ricans never got declared.
me and Earl went to Nicky at the get-go, told him my idea.
cause all we handed to over to Artie and his boys were 20 pounds of heroin,
sprinkled over the top of 5, 980 pounds of baby laxative.
but the guys who check the evidence aren't real big connoisseurs of dope.
they just clock what's on the scale.
I sure hope nobody tries getting high off that shit.
they'll have to cook up a whole kilo just to catch a buzz.
I dig that idea so much.
I ain't even gonna charge you for the 20 pounds of real dope.
out of sight, baby.
just call it my contribution to a planetary improvement.
we appreciate it.
you're not getting into my car with that fried fish.
I'm just gonna keep it for later.
you're not getting in the car with that stinking-ass fish.
come on, I got to go home and get changed.
move your fat ass.
Hey, guys. Y'all want to go to the fight tonight? Ringside.
maybe next time.
Hey, Nicky, thanks for everything.
anytime, baby.
you know I got low blood sugar, man.
I gotta eat a lot of meals. -Get your ass in the car.
we did it. -No, you did it.
being retired, I had a lot of time on my hands.
so Earl dragged me down to Barbados help him get ready for his wedding.
over here.
this is gonna be the ceremony right here. Come on, Earl.
you're gonna have me and Rocco stand on the beach all day in tuxedos?
what are you complaining about? Come here.
Earl's right. It's paradise down here.
only one thing missing.
maybe it's time for me to do like Earl. Shake loose.
no more walking on the wild side for me, Jack.
Carlito. I done changed.
reformed. Retired my ass to paradise.
Yeah, baby.
paradise.
only thing gonna drive me crazy is never knowing what happened with Artie's $2 million.
when you got them hanging on the meat hook they tell you everything.
[Music playing]
Hello? - So what do you think?
about what? - About tomorrow.
it's our first day of high school.
if we want to be popular, we just have to be proactive.
calm your proactive ass down.
saying you want to be popular guarantees it isn't gonna happen.
I'm gonna get a girlfriend. You think that's possible?
anything's possible, Wade.
just don't be needy.
you got to let it come to you. And one more thing.
from now on, I don't want you calling me Ryan.
call me T-Dog.
T-Dog? - Yep.
what does the "T" stand for? - I don't know.
but it sounds better than R-Dog. - Yeah.
you know, like, if a hot girl went up to you, and she goes, "Hey, have you met T-Dog?"" Man, did you see what T-Dog did today?"
"man, that T-Dog is crazy!"
that sounds like a guy every woman would want to know.
Hey, do I need a nickname? - You have one. Skeletor.
that was last year. I look good now. I'm filling out.
all right, name one part of your body that filled out, Wade.
name one part of your body that isn't filled out, huh?
I'm not trying to offend you.
I'm just saying you shot up too fast and you're freakishly skinny.
Oh, yeah? Well, you're too fat and that's equally unattractive.
you wanna go there? - I'm sorry.
it's just, I want things to go well, you know?
sorry I said you're freakishly skinny. - It's okay.
you just are.
Hey, go to sleep! It's 3: 00 in the morning!
what are you, crazy? - Sorry.
is that your stepdad? - No one.
give me that phone! Give it! - It's...
go to sleep.
how about some chicks on the walls in here?
it's like a nerd paradise.
time to make the donuts.
Hoo-rah!
Touchdown!
we won! We won the game! And Wade loses again!
get out of my room! - Dad said get up.
he's not my dad. He's your dad.
fine, the guy who does your mom says get up.
just leave! - Loser!
morning, sunshine. First day of school.
mom! - Oh, my God!
since when did you start sleeping naked?
I'm in high school now, don't you remember?
I don't like elastic squeezing on my ass when I sleep!
okay.
Hey! What are you doing in this shower?
dawn? Rachel, that's right. Nice to see you.
put your hands up. Put your hands up.
I'm the best white rapper you've ever seen.
a hair!
Oh, my God! - Look at that.
thank you, ladies!
what's up, winners? You stoked? Pedal to the metal?
Yeah. - Yeah.
all right. Who's a winner?
I am! - I am!
morning!
look at you, with your magic stick. - What do you think?
magic is stupid.
no, no, honey.
mom! - What?
you forgot the sausages!
I'll get the sausages. - Come on. I'm hungry.
all right, I'll get the sausages.
excuse me, listen, I'm really sorry to bother you.
my family and I, we just ran out of gas and we're trying to get to the kids to SeaWorld.
and, I, like an idiot forgot my wallet. If I can just...
your legs work okay? - Yeah, why?
you should walk somewhere and get a job.
Harold... - I'll take care of it.
that's what I have, a job.
we'll get to SeaWorld one way or the other.
we're on our way to church. Maybe that's where you ought to go.
thank you. Have a great day.
can you help out a veteran? - Not today.
get away from the car. - Honey, roll up the window.
get away!
what's your name? - Drillbit.
listen, Drillbit, I wasn't born yesterday.
I don't want you using this on any marijuana or rye whiskey, okay?
you got my word on it. - You know what?
I'm gonna write "not for pot" on there. - You don't have to write.
Yeah. "Not for pot."
you're gonna feel pretty silly if you try to buy weed with that, won't you?
remember, put your best foot forward.
people decide what they think about you in the first five seconds.
so, let me smell your breath.
minty.
you swipe on some deodorant? - Yeah.
you dust the nuts? - No, Jim. I did not dust my nuts.
I'll never get tired of that one, Dad.
you know, you should hit the weights with the boys and me.
I'll pass. - We'll get you in the gym.
we'll beef you up. Look at these guys. Show them. Give him a gun shot.
give him a crab.
worship the sun.
Yeah, look at these guys. - They're freaks.
not in my house!
have a great day. - Okay, I love you, Dad.
I love you, too. Have fun at school, Ryan. Bye.
so what'd your dad say? - He told me to have fun.
wow, great parenting.
I don't know how we're surviving without him.
sorry. - It's okay.
he's a piece of shit, anyway. - Thank you, honey.
Enchante. - Hello.
you got room for two in this little speedster?
I am in a rush now. But I hostess up at Moon Shadows on the one.
so if you get up there just, you know, ask for me. I'm Jessica.
Thanks, Jessica. - Yeah.
cause our chef, Louis, always makes too much chowder.
so he'll set you up with a nice plastic bowl of it out back.
you're late today. - Hey, get a job!
you get a job. - I already got one, giving money to you.
How're you doing, Mrs. Lampanelli? - All right.
you look beautiful today. - You're a liar. But it works for me.
go on, get out of here, you nut! - You earned it.
and don't spend it on food. Porn only!
first day of high school.
it's kind of scary. - Yeah, it sucks taking the bus.
sure, last year we were the oldest so we got to sit in the back of the bus, but now we'll probably have to sit in the front with the losers.
we'll be all right.
you have to have a proactive attitude if you wanna be popular in high school.
people decide what they think of you in the first five seconds.
I think you're a dork.
Oh, Wade.
Oh, no. - This is uncool.
we can't start high school like this.
you got to be shitting me. Come on.
please, am I dreaming here? - No.
we're never allowed to buy the same shirt again!
whoever sees it first gets to buy it.
you guys should wear red ribbons in your hair, too.
see? We both look like dorks. Go change.
No! I'm the one who was planning on wearing this.
Wade, I run the mile in 21 minutes!
how fast do you think I can go?
go! Hurry! - I'm going!
Wade, bus!
perfect! - Come on!
what a way to start high school, huh?
let me guess. Two-for-one sale at Hot Topic?
losers! - Dorks!
we're dead.
first day of our high school careers.
all right, let's light this fuse and see what happens.
let's go, man. - All right.
are you guys part of a bowling team?
last one.
Hey, at least it'll be easy to find each other.
Yeah. I'll just look for the kid with the same shirt.
come on! - No, you have to spin it a few times first to get it to work.
thank you.
no, wait! Wait!
what are you guys doing? Guys! - Now, shut it. Move!
no, thanks. - Guys!
get out of the way! - Man!
here we go. - But that... That's not for me.
that's for my books! - Okay, here we go.
in there. - I am not a book!
get in there! - This is bad.
this isn't my locker! Please! - No, this is good.
at least we know we're not the biggest dorks in school.
please, please, please! - Maybe we should say something.
it's survival of the fittest.
I've got to say something. I got to. I have to.
say something? It's hilarious. The kid fits in the locker. Come on.
that's not funny. - Somebody, help!
this is the dumbest thing I've ever done.
help! Please! - Stop!
I mean, you don't have to, but... - Harry Potter.
you need to keep your big mouth shut.
Yeah, that's what I've been trying to tell him.
Hey! - Run! Everybody run! It's not safe here!
Hey, check this out. Matching shirt geeks.
Oh, my God.
yo, Ron, these bitches really wanna wear the same shirt.
let's make them wear the same shirt, huh?
sounds good. Yeah.
the fat one here, the skinny one there, and just let go.
there.
you better keep that shit on, 'cause if I see you trying to take it off, you're dead.
and you know what happens if one of you dies? Both of you dies.
cause you're Siamese queers, bitches!
that's very cute.
you look like those Velcro monkeys who hug each other.
how was school, Wade?
we made so many friends, I can't even remember all their names.
great! You got to be in it to win it. - I am in it!
great.
Yeah!
Yeah. - So school went well, huh?
Oh, it was great. It couldn't have gone better.
it was the shirt, right? I'll have to get you more of those.
Hey! What are you doing? That's my stuff!
this is city property.
nobody's supposed to be camping out here.
your stuff's in the dumpster around the corner.
that's where I eat! You don't put a man's belongings where he eats!
my taxes pay for your salary. - You don't pay taxes.
you don't even have a job. - What else you wanna remind me of?
that I don't have good health care? That I don't belong to a good gym?
Where's the compassion? Protect and serve. That's what it says.
compassion? - Yeah, compassion.
you wanna know what I have compassion for?
the homeless who are mentally ill, the homeless who are drug-addicted.
buddy, you're just a jackass.
Oh, guy hits a little bit of bump in the road and he's a jackass?
maybe I should go smoke some crack and get your sympathy.
go back to the Village People! - Back up!
Damn!
all right, today is the first day of our high school careers.
Yes, it is.
there she is.
that's the girl who came up to me at my locker.
well, make your move. - What move? I don't have a move.
all right, thanks for signing up.
How're you doing?
is this your first time signing up for the Heritage Club?
Yeah, it is. Okay, bye. - Bye.
What'd you sign up for?
photography and Asian Heritage. - Asian Heritage, huh?
I like your commitment. - Yeah.
I like it a lot. - Hey, buddies! Remember me?
Hi. - Oh, Jesus H.
Oh, God.
guys, why aren't you wearing them?
why are you talking to us? - I just wanted to say thank you for helping me out yesterday and all.
you guys are definitely the type of people I'm gonna want to hang out with.
Yeah. - Hi, I'm Emmit Oosterhaus, by the way.
Hi. - Wade. That's T-Dog.
T-Dog? Dude, that's a really cool nickname.
Hey, can you guys give me a nickname?
we need to ditch this guy. He's like a stray cat.
once you feed him, he'll never go away, okay?
Hey, no secrets, T-Dog.
I'm off to U. S. History.
u. S. History. - Hey, look!
the Siamese queers had a baby.
I guess that makes them triplets, now doesn't it?
well, actually, we still wouldn't be triplets.
you see, they'd be my parents, and I'd be the baby.
don't get smart with me.
I said you're triplets and I think that you guys need to get into his shirt - and be triplets. - We can do that.
you know what? Emmit, shut up.
look, you really have to do this crap, guys?
come on, give us a break. It's the second day of school.
Hey, I like this kid. Yeah.
double Stuf's got an attitude.
Yeah. We have to do this shit because it's hilarious.
this school is boring.
watching you freak out amuses me.
and, yeah, it's just the second day of school. So guess what?
it's gonna keep coming and coming and coming!
party time!
stop peeing on me! - Wait! Wait! No!
he pissed himself. What a loser.
help.
help me!
is that Mario Lopez, dude? - Whoever he is, he's cute!
take his pants off! Pants off!
up, down, up... - Write your name!
No! Please, don't! No! Don't!
Bernie?
come on, give me one match, here. - That's funny.
all I need is one. - Yeah, I like it.
will you just give up? - Damn it! Look at that.
God, I can't even get one card! Not one thing!
state of California just robbed me, Don. You saw it.
you'd think... Where's my quarter? Did you see my...
you're always looking at me. - Is the pill bottle... I forget, - is that the castle or is that a rook? - Don, did you just take my quarter?
no, I didn't take your quarter, Drillbit.
not my fault you can't keep track of your finances.
I don't know why you're spending all your money on this dumb stuff, anyway.
you're unbelievable. I got to get out of here.
you know, I can't take this anymore, man.
rich people don't like us, and the tourists are scared of us.
when they see Bernie, they're terrified. - Terrified.
they're not scared of me, I'm sexy.
sanitizer? - Yeah.
Yeah. Thanks, man.
I just get... I'm like a bird. I just wanna fly north. I want to...
I'd like to go to Canada.
what was it last year? I think it was, - "I was gonna go to Iceland." - Reykjavik.
no, no. - Where's that?
Yeah, but the thing about Canada, if you go high enough north...
that's right. ...the government pays you - to take the land. - That's the truth.
Yeah. Lookit, man, the beer's twice as strong.
they don't lock the doors, that should appeal to a man like you.
and what about a British Columbian girl?
does that sound like a pretty potent mix?
Yeah, that's not too bad. I kind of like that.
okay, now, man, check this out.
one-way flight to Canada, $287.
you got to throw in 50 bucks for bribing, what're they called, - the Federales, the... - Mounties.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Mounties.
another... I want a good winter jacket, 80 bucks.
so we're talking $387 and it's a new life for your old hombre, Drillbit.
I dig it, man. Follow the dream. Chase that thing.
how you gonna come up with that kind of money, though?
get a job.
I was an Army Ranger. There are a lot of people dying for that.
watch this kid play Hendrix. He really jams. Look at him.
Oh, yeah, there he goes.
Yeah, I like how he looks a little bit like Hendrix.
Yeah! I'm gonna give him a buck.
I'll give him a couple bucks. - A buck? Give him a compliment, man!
give me a buck!
why is he in my house?
are we trying to attract after-school bullies?
I'm here because Wade invited me to be here.
because I'm your friend now.
this fantasy land you live in, Emmit, are there rides?
stop picking on him, all right? This is our guy.
I don't want him to be our guy.
well, the good news is, I think I found a solution to our problems.
kill Emmit? - No, bear with me.
this might sound stupid, but I was on the Internet last night and there's a bunch of sites where we can hire a professional bodyguard.
what do you mean by bodyguard? - Like he beats up kids that bother us.
a bodyguard? Wade, that's the dumbest idea I've ever heard.
we should just be men and fight these kids!
are you serious?
of course not. I've never been in a fight.
have you seen those high school fights on YouTube?
kids are brutal.
he gave us an earthquake when we were peeing in the urinal.
he shoved me in a locker.
and he put my head in his shirt and called us Siamese queers.
how's that funny?
it's not funny. It's just, it's rare that, you know, kids say things that surprise me.
Siamese queers. I'd never heard that one.
what would you like me to do? - We really just want it to stop.
so are they pretty much free to say whatever they want?
or am I allowed to defend myself?
Oh, no. Principal Doppler, I thought this was gonna be anonymous.
in this country, we give the accused the chance to face his accusers.
Terry, come over here for a second, will you?
now we've known each other for... Yeah, have a seat.
what's your take on this? - Hey, guys, hey. How's it going?
be polite! There you go.
Wade. - Hi.
Hey, T-Dog. Give me a pound.
Yeah. Principal Doppler, sir, I was really excited about starting this new school year. I'm not gonna lie.
who knows? I, maybe, was hazing them a little bit, but I'm sorry.
I really am.
you know, I appreciate you taking responsibility. It's refreshing.
he doesn't mean it! - We need to call his parents in.
now. - He doesn't have any parents.
well, not in this country, anyway. They live in Hong Kong.
he's an emancipated minor. - What does that mean?
it means he's legally an adult.
he answers to no one.
he's above the law.
what a nightmare, huh? - Yeah.
Oh, crap.
Oh, no.
run. - Go! Go!
run! Go, go! - Hurry.
wait for me!
go, go!
do you think he sees us? - No.
open the door! Open the door!
what do they want?
just keep driving, Mom. It's none of our business.
let's go, let's go!
have you guys lost your mind? Come on, let's go!
go, go, come on!
come on. - Oh, no!
run! Run! - Go!
get them, baby!
there! The garage!
you gonna rat on me, boys?
try to get my parents involved in this situation?
now I have to make it my mission to destroy you punks!
Hey! You kids get the hell off my property!
I'm gonna give you three seconds, then I'm getting my shotgun!
No! - You better get out of here right now!
please don't! - No! Please!
one! Two! Three!
go! Go! - And stay out, you gang bangers!
Charles, chai latte up.
Hey! Get off my computer! - Keep your shirt on.
come on.
if this doesn't work, I'm gonna kick your ass.
when it works, you're going to kiss my ass.
how are we gonna know which one's the bodyguard?
have you ever done this kind of thing before?
I worked for the hardest gangstas in the world.
kee Lo-Lo, Chenobee.
hell, I still work for Tupac, even though he dead.
I am Israeli Military Secret Service Antiterrorist Squad.
so when I kill this kid, do you want me to do it quickly, - or do you want him to suffer? - Suffer.
if you hire Tiger's Protection Services, not only do you get the Tiger, but you get the protection of his entire pride.
do you like hip-hop?
what the hell you implying I like hip-hop for?
cause I'm dressed this way? I like country. You like country?
that's the kind of music I like. Alabama. Gimme some of that.
some Brooks and Dunn. The Dixie Chicks, bitch.
kids hiring a bodyguard to take care of a bully?
stupidest thing I ever heard.
back in my day, if a kid was getting beat up, it was called childhood.
pick somebody, anybody. I'll go beat their ass right here, right now, and then you can ask them for a goddamned reference.
how about you, lady?
I'll kick your ass right now! Close. Closed.
Yeah! - This is very disturbing.
you want an ass kicking?
what do you do when you're not body guarding?
I work at Raging Waters.
I sense great hesitation. Wait one moment. Excuse me.
I'm going to borrow this.
please don't do that. - Oh, God damn!
$2, 100 a week. - $10, 000 a week.
$2, 100 a week. - $10, 000 a week.
we're hoping you'd say, like, around $100.
not interested. - I hate kids like you.
I can't help you. No one can help you!
Susan, your double espresso's up. - I'm Susan.
I'm Drillbit Taylor.
u. S. Army Ranger, black ops operative, decorated marksman, - improvised weapons expert. - Are you still in the military?
I was discharged. Unauthorized heroism.
Yeah. They call it an army of one in the ads, but they don't mean it.
unless they mean the whole army working together as one.
but they certainly don't want one man out there kicking ass like an army of one, which is the way I took it.
as a bodyguard I protected three Vice Presidents,
Bobby Brown, Sylvester Stallone... Not as tough as he looks.
so what's the story? Who do you guys need protection from?
it should be easy for you. Just a high school bully.
Yeah. Run into a few of those in my life.
What'd you do to provoke him? - Well, he's fat, and he's a dork, - and I'm awesome. - Shut up, Wade.
by "awesome" do you mean scared, skinny and lonely?
Yeah.
Yeah.
so how do we know you're legit? - Come here. Go on, come here.
I'm not gonna bite.
I want you to look at my eyes.
take a good look.
come here! What do you see? You looking?
what the hell have you seen? - You want some?
these eyes have seen unspeakable horror.
that's my evidence.
that's how you know if a guy's legit. You need some evidence, too?
I've seen things you wouldn't believe.
I've watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate.
isn't that Blade Runner?
look closely 'cause it's all in there.
Boo!
so, how much do you charge?
$387 a week.
one second. - I say yes.
I'm not even sure if I'm available.
he's good. - No! No! He's weird.
you know, we might be able to work up to that.
but right now, we've only got $83.
okay, well, give me that now and we'll figure out the rest later.
you know what this is?
it's a wing.
and you're under it. All three of you, right there.
okay, here's the mission plan.
using my expertise at stealthy and covert ops, I'll infiltrate the school where I will watch over you like the Lord almighty himself.
careful.
like the good Lord, I'm gonna use some mysterious ways, so you're not always gonna see me, but I'll be there.
especially when you don't see me.
but first, I'm gonna need some supplies.
I want to go in and get... - Like nunchucks?
maybe.
but a lot of stuff, I'll just get from just what's laying around the house.
you'd be surprised.
anything can be turned into a weapon of mayhem or destruction.
even a puppy? - Especially a puppy.
Germans used them in World War I. Da Hunden Stormen. Lightning Dog.
they'd attach dynamite to them. Rommel did it. Jerry bastard.
now, listen. One thing that... - This is my house.
Wow.
we can go in. Nobody's home. - Let's hit it. Deploy, soldiers.
soldiers? Cool. You hear that, T-Dog? - Beeline, front door! Single file!
officers first!
you, get me a bowl of cereal. Go on. Scram.
okay, this I'm gonna need. Right here. - What for?
you take that, my mom'll rip my head off!
at ease, Casper!
okay. Observe its momentary reflective blinding capabilities.
bang! You're defenseless.
silver alloy, one of the strongest ever constructed.
probably stop an armor-piercing bullet at point-blank range.
you don't really think it could come to that.
you tell me.
Filkins is a whack job. He almost ran over us with his car!
he's a menace. - Yeah, I was my dad's favorite, too.
he once cut a kid's arm off with a samurai sword.
bladed weaponry? - Yeah.
okay. I'm not gonna take any chances. You're now on orange alert.
okay, now this will be good for video surveillance.
this is good.
you take the guts out of this and use it for wiretapping.
I think we can use this as a... I don't know, as a timekeeping device.
I think I'll wear it on my wrist, possibly.
you think you might need this?
this piece of crap's not worth anything.
as a weapon. It's too obvious.
testing, one, two. Mister Taylor?
testing, one, two. - Can you come back now?
guys, you got to go far back! I can hear you!
testing, testing, one, two. Can you hear me now?
they work pretty good. - These are great.
Yeah. - These are invaluable.
they get a little staticky, though... - Yeah.
...I think, some places in the house.
why you need all this stuff for?
I thought we were gonna give Filkins a beat down.
I am gonna beat him down, but sometimes after that first beat down, then they get a little, you know... They want a little payback.
I'm home! Who wants grilled-cheese sandwiches?
go! Go! Mom! Mom! - Okay.
exit! Exit! - Go, out the back, out the back, go.
just 'cause you don't see me doesn't mean I'm not there.
shut the door. - Act natural. Hey, Mom.
Hey, Barbara, how you doing? - Hi, boys.
who's your new little friend? Hi. - Hi.
Hi. Emmit Oosterhaus. - Hi, Emmit Oosterhaus.
he's not our friend. - Yeah, he is.
he's like our hamster.
smell like something?
Ryan? You washing? - Yeah. You?
it's a funny smell. It's all right. Grilled-cheese sandwiches.
Hey, come on! Buzz us in!
you're gonna wanna see this!
big money coming in!
this ain't a bunch of aluminum cans here.
where do you want it? Priceless treasures.
go set them down there.
so you don't think those kids are gonna miss this stuff?
no. They got two of everything.
they got the iPod, the iPod Nano. And I don't care if they do, 'cause after this little transaction, well, the old Drillbit's taking his act to the Great White North.
what? - Yeah, I'm going to Canada.
well, that's stupid. You're gonna cut out now?
I'm going... - These kids are a cash cow, Drillbit.
you need to hang in there. You don't cut and run.
you got to get in there and milk this.
okay, come on back.
all right, I'll tell you what. I give you $125 for the whole lot.
what?
I just heard you say you took it from some kids.
so? Don't get all righteous on me.
half this store you guys got from crackheads and thieves.
Hey. Who the hell do you think you are, man?
let me tell you something. Those people are our customers!
we're not that harsh on them, so you shouldn't be!
how would you like it if we called you a crackhead?
you have called me one.
have we? Have we? - I think I might have.
Drillbit? Drillbit? Come in. - What is that?
I'm sorry, hold it just a second. D. B. One-four-niner-eight, come in.
just take this. - We just wanted you to know that Emmit was holding out on some bar mitzvah money.
Emmit, I don't care how many times you get bar mitzvahed, you're not a man.
I am a man. - No, you're not.
Drillbit! Milk it, milk it. - So we'll have another 50 bucks for you - on Monday. - Grab the udder and milk it.
Ten-four, good buddy. I will see you tomorrow.
commence radio silence in three, two.
today's the official start of our high school careers.
last week's history. Nothing good came out of last week.
we became best friends. - Nothing good came out of last week.
there's the sword. Man, we're so dead.
Where's Drillbit, Wade? - Hey. Calvary's here.
please, where have you been? - Yes. What's up, man?
Where's my money? Where's my money?
we got 40 bucks we promised, plus we got an extra 17.
I sold my Yu-Gi-Oh cards.
okay, this is gonna be sweet.
I can't wait to watch you kick Filkins' ass.
I can't wait to watch you kick Filkins' ass.
Yeah. What, is he here? - Yeah, over there on his car.
I want you to be the last face he ever sees.
what are you gonna do?
what am I gonna do? - Come on.
I want you to gnaw on his skull.
what's the plan? - Shut up.
guys, I'm gonna check this dude out.
Yes.
excuse me.
Yeah.
just got to kind of stand here for a second.
all right. Hey, take it easy, man.
he's thin, but sinewy and muscular.
he's got a low center of gravity which means he's fast like a jack rabbit.
he didn't take a shower today or yesterday. He's got bad breath.
he's got a couple of cavities which is not improving...
this is serious. I thought you were gonna go kick his ass.
Yeah.
look at Tommy Trigger Finger. You want the blood and the guts.
well, it doesn't work that way.
I can't just kick his ass.
physically, I can, but if you kick a bully's ass, then maybe you guys live till lunchtime.
and then what?
teach those victims how to kick the bully's ass and they live forever.
steven Seagal.
so you're gonna teach us how to beat him up?
like train us? - So we're gonna beat up Filkins?
what I'm about to show you are top-secret black ops fighting moves.
and it's all about technique.
I don't care if you're talking about karate, tai chi, kung fu, praying mantis, kung pao, Panda Express.
it's all about technique. I want you to watch my technique.
it's pretty flawless. Come on, Ryan, charge me.
I'm serious. Try to kill me.
come on. You ready? Go! Yeah. Come on.
I got you!
I got you! I got you!
damn it!
okay. Tripped right there. That was the bear hug.
okay. Wade. Come on!
here you go! Watch the elbows!
don't! Stop!
okay. Last but not least. Charge me.
everyone, up! Circle me!
come on. Let me see some fight from you.
okay, you guys ready for the blizzard?
go get him, boys! - Yeah. Go, get it, all three of you!
I call truce! Truce! Back up! Three's too many. Three's too many. Stop.
wow, one of you really charley-horsed me.
okay. Now it isn't all oriental martial arts.
sometimes you give a little Mexican judo as in "Ju don't know who you're messing with, homes.
come on, Ryan, one more. Last one! Show me your mettle. Come on! Ole!
Wow!
Ryan!
man down!
Ryan!
was that my fault?
Hey! Check this out.
dude! You fell like 60 feet.
jeez, that was crazy.
what is this?
this is a strategic outpost.
I got these posted all over the city.
don't even look at it, okay?
now let's get back up there and get to work.
what's this for? To wash your balls in the morning?
no. Look like a squeegee to you?
or does it look like a weapon with a straight edge and a little mop to clean up the blood?
T-Dog, Emmit, this way.
Where's Drillbit? - I don't know.
wait up. - Should be right up here.
man down!
take this.
take a swing at my head. - Oh, no.
Wade, come on. Just hit me.
but it'll hurt. - Wade hit me.
I'll do it. - Shut up.
I feel no pain, 'cause I have a trained mind.
go! - Come on.
let's beat it. - Come on, come on, come on, let's go.
Hey, Drillbit. We could make s'mores! - No.
how much does a Hug Me Bear cost? - No.
Where'd you get the kids, Drillbit? - I won them in a poker game.
order up!
how's this part of the training? - It's called bulking up.
I'm already fat. - Hey. You're not fat.
I don't want to hear you say you're fat.
words like lard ass, fat pig, butterball, landslide, mudslide.
I don't want to hear that. What are you tipping the scales at?
180
what?
whenever you're ready, boys.
okay, one of you guys got to pick this up, 'cause I'm still on the clock.
Filkins. Filkins.
avoidance technique! Avoidance technique!
come out here, Capone! You want to fight?
you want to fight, you and me, right here?
this is very important. See that?
what's the matter? Afraid to come out from behind your men?
he has a holdback guy. - Afraid to stand up for yourself?
now that allows people to think that you want to fight when really he doesn't want to fight.
you got nothing in court. You don't got the bookkeeper.
when I'm here I'm your holdback guy.
so now you can act crazy.
no, hey, hey, calm down.
I'm gonna kill you!
Hey, stop! Stop!
calm down.
get under the wing.
put all the bills facing the same direction.
Yeah, don't worry about it, Don.
I thought these kids were loaded.
it's like all you read about are how 14-year-olds rule the marketplace, and look at this.
hardly got anything. You think this is gonna get me to the Great White North?
allow me to make a point real quick.
Hello, delicious.
Drillbit? Do you know why we come here every day?
it's because these businessmen can't eat all their food.
they have more than they need.
these kids are a lot like these businessmen, okay?
they have way more than they need.
it's our job to go into their houses and take all their excess.
I get a kick out of these kids.
I told you that little fat one says some funny shit.
I like these kids, too, man.
I mean, from what I gather, they're some pretty cool dudes.
but if you like them, you should think about helping them.
if you care about them. - What do you mean?
steal their TV.
maybe they'll read a book.
steal their iPod. Heck, I don't know. Maybe they'll learn to play the piano.
they don't need all this crap.
you think Mozart had a Game Boy?
I didn't have it. Didn't hurt me. I was outside playing, climbing trees.
Yeah, man, me, too. I'm still outside hanging around in trees.
and the parents are never around. There's no one there in the daytime.
one big hit. It's all we need.
boobies.
penis!
all right. Open your eyes, let your body drift back into consciousness.
Namaste. Thank you for your practice. That concludes the meditation time.
okay. How do you feel? - I feel good.
doing all right? - Yeah. I think my biceps are coming in.
guns are coming in.
now, listen. We're about 10% done with the training.
next... - 10%?
are you high? We can't sit in the woods anymore.
we got to go back to school. - Yeah, and I can't forge any more notes.
how many diseases can a kid have?
you guys think you're ready?
you know, I am really scared to go back.
look. If you're not ready to fight, there is another alternative.
but I got to be honest with you, only the strongest of warriors can pull this one off.
it's so difficult that most men tremble at its mere thought.
what is it?
what the hell is it?
love him.
what? - Love him.
you know, I don't know what's going through your head, Drillbit, but I'm not gonna bang him.
when I'm talking about love, I mean compassion.
I'm not going to... - Shut up. And understanding.
find your commonality.
let him know you're more alike than different.
maybe that'll put out his fuse.
and remember, guys, just because you don't see me doesn't mean I'm not there.
I'll be there like a silent, deadly poltergeist.
Thanks. - Okay.
all right, see you later, Drillbit.
remember, you're under my wing.
Oh, no.
there he is. Should we hide?
no. We've been running and hiding all week.
this is what Drillbit's been talking about, finding commonalities.
he's rapping. You love to rap! You can do this!
no, I can't.
Yes, you can. It's just like in 8 Mile. He'll respect you.
no, man, I'm afraid of him. I can't!
you're crazy! Don't do it. - You can do it, Ryan.
I believe in you. - Don't.
all right. I can do it. I can do it.
Whassup, whassup? - Whassup?
I wanna rap with you. Hey, flip the script, Ronnie.
hit that beat.
yo, this cool, Fil? - Sure, whatever.
yo, call me whatever you want but you know I gets busy I'm so badass
I'm the king of Vice City Like the Buddha, I'm Zen Like Beckham, I bend, I tell suckers "Say hello to my little friend."
snap! This guy!
Hey, meatball, where's your spaghetti? Your rapping's like a nightmare.
but I don't see Freddy. You best not even try to spit rhymes, dude. 'Cause when you spit all I ever see is chewed-up food.
Yeah, that's how we roll! That's how we do!
hold on!
I know you didn't just go there.
I got more skills than you in my one and only nut hair.
nice, man, nice.
so you better step off before you insult me and mine 'cause if you decide to step on, see I'm like a land mine.
boom!
Oh, my God, look it's a punkass rapping.
he say one more word I'm gonna have to bitch-slap him.
so surprised you're moving. Ass is so damn fat.
you're lucky I don't hit you with my Wiffle Ball bat.
you can't hurt my head with a bat because I'm the Incredible Hulk.
I'm like Costco. I'm serving ass kickings in bulk.
you don't like my words Mister King of the School?
well, guess what? You can suck on my family's jewels.
bitch!
that was awesome.
what have I just done?
Hey, that was amazing. I mean, telling him to suck on your two family jewels was in questionable taste, but still...
I know, I got caught up in the moment, okay?
keep walking. I don't want to get shot like Tupac.
you know, most of those people were cheering for you.
Really? That could be good. Maybe Drillbit was right.
think you're so funny?
good. 'Cause you're not gonna laugh when you're dead.
you're gonna get it now, worse than ever.
all of you.
Ryan, holdback technique.
you don't like the fact that he's better than you, Filkins!
you better back the hell off before I...
thanks for holding him for me. - Holy crap, you guys are retarded!
how did he do so much damage with one punch?
it's like his fist is the size of your whole face.
I guess it's true.
rap really does promote violence.
Yeah, but the question is, where was Drillbit when we needed him?
maybe he got called to the black ops.
Wade, come on. You really believe that garbage?
there's my little soldiers.
there are my pooper troopers.
Hey, sorry I missed that walkie-talkie call. I had something come...
what the hell happened to you? - Filkins punched me.
Filkins did that to you? - Yeah.
where were you?
with one punch? - Where were you?
Oh, crap. I'm sorry. - Stop.
no, just let me get the blood off. - No. Stop.
man. Here, sit down for a second.
crap. It looks painful. - Yeah, it is.
here, let me put a little pressure on it. - No.
hold it, hold it, hold it.
Ryan had a rap off with Filkins.
you had a rap off? - You said to find common ground.
he said he was like Costco, serving up ass kickings in bulk.
that's what you said? That's not common ground.
even though it's funny.
that's not exactly what I meant when I said common ground.
why didn't you get punched? Why'd he slug you?
cause of your brilliant holdback technique.
the holdback technique? You really tried that?
Yeah. Bottom line is your advice backfired.
now we're more screwed than ever.
all because you wanted to protect the hobbit over here.
Hey, let's just stop for a second. - I am not a hobbit.
you're a damn hobbit, okay? - I am not!
hold it! Hey. Emmit's not a hobbit, I don't think.
problem isn't the holdback technique, although I don't think you guys had it perfected enough to try.
the problem is Randy starts rapping insults.
it's not Randy! Okay? It's Ryan!
and all this talk about you being there when you're not there, it's bull! Okay?
I'm tired of your nonsense! You're fired!
Hey! Sit down here. Sit down here for a second.
all of you, sit down. You take the bass out of your voice when you talk to me.
now, we just completed phase one.
see if this guy has any mettle. And guess what we found out?
Filkins does have some mettle. So now we move to phase two.
know what phase two is? Direct contact.
that's where I come in. Because I will not let this happen again, if I can help it.
so what's the plan?
the plan? - Yeah.
how early do you guys have to get up for school?
7: 00. - 7: 00.
Oh, God. Okay. Tomorrow, we all go in together.
Hey, Wade, what's up?
Where'd you get the shiner?
come in here, boy. Talk to me.
I was protecting this one kid in my school from a bunch of bullies and one of them punched me.
what? Why would you protect the kid from a bully?
so he doesn't get beat up.
then you're interfering with the natural order.
when I was a kid, I was kind of a bully.
but it's not a bad thing. There was this kid. I don't know what it was.
maybe it was his stupid face. But he'd just really get under my skin.
so I pushed him around a little bit, called him some hurtful names, and I honestly think, if I met him today, he'd thank me for it.
I prepared him for the harshness of the real world.
Thanks, Jim.
I'm a resource, Wade. You should use me more often.
is it locked?
you got lunch money? - Yep.
you got any tests today? - See you and the questions.
don't fresh-off to any of your teachers.
all right, come here, give mommy a kiss.
come on, punky-wunky. I love you.
okay. - Be good.
Bye. I love you. - Bye. I love you, Mommy!
I love you, Mommy.
black ops in the hizzouse.
this old soldier could use a kiss from mommy.
come on. I'm going in to the school today.
Drillbit is going in. Very visible. Let's do it.
you can't go in there looking like that. - Why?
you look like Crocodile Dundee or something.
screw you. What're you talking about?
I'm just saying we need to clean you up.
wrong. This soldier doesn't clean up. What you see is what you get.
Drillbit, you just don't look like a teacher.
I mean, we need you to blend in. The camouflage technique.
in my house. Come on. - Let's go.
camouflage technique"? I like that.
...if I remember how to do this. It really is strong enough for a man.
did your dad leave any socks behind?
how many tardies can you have before they give you a detention?
Emmit, you're drying my eyeballs.
all right, here's our class schedules and a detailed map of the school.
we have the first class together, so just meet us by the Life Skills room so you can walk us to our lockers.
okay, now, remember, I'm not just gonna walk in there and start kicking ass, okay? I got to protect you guys.
I'm home!
no 3rd period today so I came home
gotta take a piss!
Hey, you eat something?

I do.
I can't get sleepy.
who can't?
I can't.

don't talk to your customers like that!
customers? You won't even pay.
what happened to your store?

don't worry He's busy baking.
you got nowhere to go.
how about you?
Hey, what happened to your shop?

I'm irritated by that?
I think nothing of it.
how much is Anaron Gold at your store?

big mistake to ignore it.
hey monk, they have just about anything a person needs.

everything's under retail price.

Yes.
it's OK for a drugstore to sell bread?
no problem.

no idea Been here since I was a kid.
is that yours?
Oh, yes.
you got 50 yen?
I got it.
why give him 50 yen?
don't know. Just the way it is.
those gay pharmacists are nice people.
I was talking about my boyfriend.
he was cheating on me.
that wasn't good.
but they listened to me.
and it was an interview.
I know about medicine.
so I thought, why not?
but are you gonna commute every day?
that's a problem.
it's a long way 2 hours from Shinjuku.
how'd you get here?
Oh, just on a whim.
more practical training next year.
you'd better start studying.
never heard of a part-time job in 3rd year.
well.
what'll you do about your courses?
Hey!
whiskey and water?
I only take it on the rocks.
you all like a drugstore like that?
more like we need one.
Yeah, yeah.
unlike the one in front of the station!

I will!
I'm not asking you, idiot.

do you wanna fight?
get out.

how old you think you are?
excuse me!
it's service time now.
I should've said.
when I say "get out," get out!
be out after this!
what?
do the right thing!
speak normal language!
a riot!
first, as soon as it opens, sneak into the store, pretending you're regular customers.
spread out in all directions.
one by the entrance, one in the back of the store, one at the employee back entrance, and one at the back door.
first, smoke up the employees 'back entrance
then, send smoke in all directions.
surprised customers will rush out.
we've got the place occupied!
evacuate immediately!
when the customers and employees leave.
block the entrance and entrench.
how about it?
I blockaded my university for a week this way.
we have enough food to stay for a year.
we have a hostage in case the cops break in.
a hostage?
doesn't matter who.
like the one in the cigar store.
wait, Sayuri's in love with me!
Sayuri's no good.
What're you talking about?
he's a good enough hostage.
just joking How long you been here?
no tension among the young folk here.
that's why our generation needs to take a stand.
I'm against it Too risky.

not hiding anything.
what happened to your hair?
shut up! Don't treat me like a kid!
sorry, I'm doing all the talking.
how about you?

and now, all that's left to me.
is a pharmaceutical qualification.
come on, Mukai-san.
let's do our best.
from tomorrow, we fight together.
Yes.
a relief to listen.
to someone unhappier than I am.
huh?
hear something?
don't!
Why?
saitama lies beyond this bamboo bush.
Really?
masao was a town that used to do a good business with bamboo.
with furnaces for bamboo charcoal.
the bamboo bothers me.
it keeps growing back after I cut it.
Oh, a temple!
Obayashi-san is off.
Really?
looking for her? She's off
hello.
Nabe-yan?
long time no see.
why don't you come in?
I investigated that Keiko Obayashi over the past week.
you're a freak.
I'll show you something very nice.
come with me.
he says to come with him.
Where's the dirty old monk?
your son's university, right?
that's right.
is she dating Shin?
you're a real simpleton.
she slept with him? C'mon, tell me.
all of you, halt!
everyone, close your eyes!
turn right!
three steps forward!
open your eyes!
what is this?
don't know But they seem to enjoy it
they're like fairies.
where are you going?
wanna get closer.
let's cheer them on.
they'll find us, idiot.
break time. Five minutes.
strange old men looking at us.
it's OK. They're regulars where I work.
where the heck do you work?
wish I were 20 years younger.
still had hair then.
don't feel low. We just need a net and a ball.
impossible. You only run to bars.
it's easy I can start tomorrow.
what? You'll play?
actually, I won't
let's do it.
weren't we saying we'd do it?
not at all.
we can get up close to her.
playing net ball?
I don't know the name.
can I close the store? I'm tired.
no Keep it open till 9.
what an attitude.
so, what'll we do?
I already reserved the field.
you serious?
you serious?
you serious?
this is a fishing net.
and a ball for baseball.
doesn't matter what we use.
let's go!
explain the rules.
getting close to Obayashi is the point.
let's give it a try!
it's coming!
ready!
it's no good.
Nabe-yan, the handle is too long.
good shot!
come here!
having fun?
no.
just catch.
we should learn the rules?
let's ask Obayashi-san.
No!
so she can show us with care.
nursing care.
top secret until we get better.
I won't budge.
this is it!
much better!
shout it out!
don't tell anyone.
not supposed to touch customers.
C'mon, bring it on!
bring it on!
Hey, wait.
too many keepers.
never mind.
What're you doing?
OK. Thanks.
Ouch!
good evening.
can I help you?
did you join a club?
too slow, Yamada!
you traitor!
What're you doing?
she knew we were practicing net ball!
what? Did you tell her?
I didn't.
it's because you ask for dressing every day.
problem with that?
I can see what you're doing!
stop fighting.
we have to keep practicing net ball
it's not net ball!
it's lacrosse.
Sainen, what do you have there?
bought it in a shop.
Where's the shop?
what shop?
let me know where the shop is.
no, you didn't let me join Find it yourselves
you bastard!
damn you!
don't steal our thunder!
not me! You did it!
Nabe! Nabe-yan, you!
stop it! Let go!
I won't forgive you!
stop it!
why do I get beaten up?
Obayashi-san, come!
an emergency!
what happened?
not supposed to hit a monk.
break it up!
Why? What happened?
lacrosse?
sorry, we'll quit.
you meant a lacrosse club?
is that so
we're practicing but we don't know the rules.
Numata, stop it
if you could coach us.
stop it!
sorry to bother you.
you have nothing to do with us.
Hey, let's go.
could you show me some plays?
she looking?
do I look cool?
Hey, who's she looking at?
gotta be me.
that's enough.
come over here.
you're doing it all wrong.
we don't know the rules so this is how we...
more than that.
I'm going back to work now.
next time we practice at the college.
Yes.
what?
what did you say?
we practice at the college next time.
what should we say to the female students?
today we practice together.
knock it off, loser!
morning, Keiko.
good morning.
this way everyone.
Why? Why?
Mori-kun
Oh, Obayashi!
good morning
wait, Obayashi-san
we want to play lacrosse, not football.
it's lacrosse
I'm Mori, boys lacrosse captain.
boys?
boys lacrosse? '
yes
what happened, freshman?
broke his leg
be careful, now.
rules are different for boys and girls.
men can attack and bodycheck to get the ball
we have protectors to prevent injury.
and we're all insured, too
I heard about you. Let's play.
no way.
goddam boys lacrosse.
means we can never play lacrosse with the girls, no matter how much we try.
hey Nabe-yan, what're we gonna do?
it's service time!
Oh, ouch!
Ouch, ouch!
it hurts!
Ouch, ouch!
why was Obayashi-san so hard on us?
I don't know.
maybe she's trying to rouse us.
maybe she's sadistic?
is that true?
slant-eyed women are sadistic.
you serious?
women with glasses are nymphos.
stop it!
right, Nabe-yan?

Hey, Nabe-yan.
what do you say, Yamada?
we're over 50. Impossible to go out with such a young girl
then what if she proposes?
you say no?
you see.
this is our weak spot.
we say it's impossible, but we can't give up on the 0000001% possibility.
that's why we're irritated.
aging means the possibility gets close to 0?
playing sports together?
I can't get rid of my frustration!
we're not kids!
we're experienced grown-ups!
we should know what to do!
what's your point?
I don't know.

when you were about to open your store, we planned a boycott.
nobody cared, so we planned to destroy it.
seriously.
we didn't do it. Good thing too.
the store's great. It has everything.
staff are kind, too.
but the store really encouraged us.
made us think we should do something.
if it didn't open, we wouldn't have played.
Numata wouldn't have died.
what about that?
don't blame me for that.
hear me out till the end.
you say that selling drugs is not the only purpose of a drug store.

I haven't seen you around here before.

Isiaha Charles. I just moved here with my mom.

I just met him. He gave me a job.
Where'd you do time?
I've never done time.
you never did time? - No.
Oh, that is good shit.
you want some?
I'm good.
all right. This is how it's gonna work.
your buddy was smokin' crack and he got fuckin' crazy. . .
and he came at you with a knife.
now tell me what happened.
my buddy, he got fuckin' crazy. . .
and he came after me with a knife.
which is when Lazerov and I entered the domicile in response to a domestic disturbance. . .
and saw the defendant fire one round from a bulldog.
is this that bulldog You refer to? - Yes.
is this the knife You pried from the deceased's hand? - Yes - What was he doing with him? - Something to stab the defendant.
now after the deceased deceased did the defendant resist?
no. - Did he say anything?
he cried, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
cried? What do you mean he cried?
what do you mean he cried?
he cried. Jesus, Jesus.
that's enough.
Jesus. Oh my God. - That's enough, Officer Deed.
you may step down.
thank you.
that'll be a 10 minute recess. We'll reconvene at quarter past.
what the hell was that? - Testifying.
to the Second Coming? - Back off.
officer Deed?
officer Deed.
Yeah.
why'd he thank you? - Who are you?
Josh Pollack. Heights Herald.
the Jewish handout? - It's a community weekly.
the guy is Jewish? You're shittin' me.
I don't know he's Jewish.
and, what do you care?
you busted him in Ashtown, that's adjacent to the Heights.
tell our Jewish friends not to worry. They can still walk to worship.
so why'd he say thank you?
it's a manslaughter and possession beef.
it could've been murder. - So Why did FRAT catch this?
talk to public affairs.
officer Deed, can you tell me why FRAT is cruising the streets?
talk to public affairs.
guy thanked you?
jack-off. I hate that fuckin' guy.
who's that? - Wallace. Pussy.
Hey.
how'd court go, Frank?
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
something I should know? - No. Same old, Same old.
deed's first murder testimony.
Yep, weapons possession 18 months.
Rafe. Inspection Monday? Be sure you're there.
Pollack.
Pollack!
Pollack.
Yes, sir?
what are you doing?
article on the murder trial.
I told you to put the verdict on the police blotter.
that's a sentence, not a tome.
it's a legitimate story.
then find a legitimate paper to publish it.
all I want is the verdict, okay?
fraud.
sorry, did you say something?
no, sir. I didn't.
that's what I thought.
actually I said fraud.
did you now?
you know why The Times won't hire you Pollack?
you don't do the work.
a thousand words, not a single fact except for the verdict.
everything else is supposition.
frat wouldn't talk to me.
so the point of covert police work is not to talk about it.
this incident is public record, sir.
involving undercover police who like to keep a low profile, so they can sleep at night.
you can't imply nefarious activity because a felon whispered thank you to one of them.
I qualified it with a question.
you qualified. . .
watch my lips, son. You're not qualified to qualify.
nobody cares what you think.
only what you know and that's diddly 'cause you don't do the work!
unfortunate this is about as well written as you are uninformed.
you know what?
I think you should try novels. You're fired.
this isn't a real paper anyway.
perfect for you. Lazy little shit.
get out while you can.
shit.
Rafe. Don't make yourself crazy.
you're gonna give yourself a hernia.
come on. Let's go to bed.
you want the free range Chicken Kiev with potatoes or vegetables over risotto in a bell pepper sauce?
I'd like a meal prepared to order, not manufactured for distribution.
Ashford was right.
about what?
all this articulate conjecture wrapped around one fact.
Isiaha Charles, illegal weapons possession. - Right.
8 words if you count the preposition. - Another critic.
you asked me to read it. - It was mistake.
because I agree with him?
come on, sweetie.
you know I thought being fired was the highlight of my day.
you're great sex.
but imperious and penniless are serious social handicaps and you should stick with your strengths.
I was hoping for sympathy.
poor baby.
well, that woulda worked.
Yeah, that's bullshit.
Rafe.
talk to me, please.
is It your headaches again? - Leave It alone, please.
I said I'm okay.
what's wrong with you? I'm worried.
I'm okay. I'm all right.
I'm gonna take a ride.
Rafe please, you need to get help.
he couldn't'a done better, believe me.
Hey, Rafe, what's up?
you're almost a no-show for inspection.
Oh, no no. I had dinner at Maria's.
I thought you were ending that.
I am gonna process ending it.
you can get inspected every day of the week, Rafe, if you need it.
but there are no exceptions.
I need your commitment.
I made my commitment. That's for sure.
all right. Let's go have some fun.
say hello to Marilyn. - Hey, Marilyn.
Hey, hero. The girls'll be happy to see you.
he's making me a little bit nervous.
you stalking me now?
I'm not lazy. - You're stoned.
and you are a vision of temperance.
this Is Cambodia. - It was Kampuchea at the time.
Wow. I knew you used to be somebody but - You're burying the lead, kid. - Come on man, I'm a good writer.
so what?
that builds strong papers.
and this story Is impor. . . - Pollack.
I don't publish stories.
I publish coupons for merchants who don't kidnap competition, bomb busses or immolate themselves.
am I wrong about the story? - What do I know?
help me get It right. - Do the work.
I was in court, I took notes and tried to talk to FRAT.
talk to the defendant, huh?
he's in Longworth.
afraid to visit prison?
how am I talk to somebody who knows the defendant well.
how about visiting the scene of the crime, make an assessment.
okay.
you're right. - As if I need your affirmation.
I'm not telling you to do this. I'm telling you not to.
could be dangerous.
will you help me or not?
why the sudden urge to get this right?
my girlfriend read it.
agreed with you.
right. You're doin' this for pussy.
well I wouldn't put it that way. - For Pussy.
what happened to you?
don't talk to the system.
what the hell does that mean?
make up somethin' .
5: 52 a. m.
the call was for a D and D, domestic disturbance.
we knocked. Couldn't be heard over the shouting.
well the time, 5: 52 a. m.
there's no 5: 52.
no report that date and address.
filed by a Sergeant Francis Lazerov, or an Officer Raphael Deed.
frat files aren't public record. - Why?
we can't speak for FRAT. - Who can?
frat.
even if you were with a real paper I wouldn't talk to you. That's Policy.
it's public record, Captain Tilman.
it's trial and conviction. Not us, alright?
here we go.
if you're gonna turn every beef between two losers into headlines that's gonna seriously compromise our ability to social deviancy.
you know, we might as well pack it up and close shop.
screw John Q. Citizen. Is that what you want?
I don't think so.
have a good one.
bern ! - Sir.
it's Capt. Tilman, head of First Response Assault & Tactical Unit.
thanks a large part to this gentleman we're looking at an 82% reduction in homicides, 69 in felonies, 71 in sexual assault.
with those number we can have early intervention program.
in fact I see a day when we won't need courts at all.
Hi. - No, You stay away.
no. I'm just looking for somebody. Ms. Melba Charles?
she lives here, right?
she's over there.
Oh, Jesus.
Isiaha Charles? I'm Josh Pollack, I'm a writer.
I was at your trial. - Oh, Yeah.
here.
listen.
after Officer Deed testified, you said thank you.
Why?
I can't talk about the trial.
can we talk about you?
who you were before this?
by the way, I'm very sorry about your mother.
what about my mother?
her stroke.
stroke?
you don't know. - Whoa, when?
a few days ago, I guess. - How bad of a stroke?
is my mother a vegetable?
I'm sorry.
Oh, Mama.
motherfuckers!
a'ight, look. You gotta get me outta here.
you gotta get me to my mother.
I can't. - No, You can.
if you get me out of here, I'll tell you everything you want about the trial.
I don't know how. - The way they capped Rook.

I'll be home soon.
I promise.
you get this to her. You promise me.
fuck!
I'm sorry.
Mrs. Charles.
"ma, I love you. You hang on."
"I'll be home soon. I promise."
you call me now? I'm not your personal editor.
just read this.
this is a Pulitzer.
what's it for?
blowing the judging committee. What do you think?
you saw Isiaha's arrest report?
copies of the court transcript.
no mention of cash, coke or guns? - No.
the emergency dispatch? - The copy's there.
there's no record of a 911 that time, date, address.
you talked to the District Attorney, the Public Defender, Judge.
you told me not to talk to the system.
what do you think?
it could dismantle the department when it's done.
what's missing?
the other side of the story.
they're murderers.
if you believe Isiaha Charles.
you won't publish it as is?
I won't publish it at all.
but The Times will if you get the department's side.
the department? They're murderers.
right. You're doing this for pussy.
I'm doin' it for this.
fourth estate, Pollack.
it's the only job protected by the Constitution, and this is why.
this is tyranny.
when you see it you're obligated to yell.
a risk you're unwilling to take, and I don't blame you.
in your new enlightenment I'll take you back to the Herald, but don't call yourself a jeranalist.
the coupon king has spoken.
good night, Pollack.
Oh, here, take this with you.
go on, leave. Leave.
go.
get the door. - got it.
you move, you die! Spread 'em! Spread 'em!
here. - Against the wall.
hey Deed !
I got somethin' for ya!
come on, baseball.
watch your step!
fuck.
shut up, gimme your other hand.
shut up. All right, let's go.
Bern, I owe you. . . anything...
not now, not here. Girls, come out，everybody come out.
Laz. - Yeah.
take the girls out. I'm going downstairs.
party at my house. - Line up Here.
let's go. - Come on, sweetie.
come on. Come on.
here ya go, cupcake.
the fuck am I gonna do with this?
I thought you gave up muckraking, Moses.
it's Pollack's story.
you heard of anything like this, Levon?
sure all the time. From felons.
well, there it is.
D. A. 's office doesn't comment on unsubstantiated accusations.
why don't you come back when you have specifics?
we can't be more specific. - What are We talking about?
innuendo? Hearsay?
D. A. needs names. Otherwise the office can't respond.
Jack, when did you start referring to yourself as an inanimate object?
you run a community weekly Moses and I'll always have time for you but now that time is up.
Mr. Pollack.
Mr. Reigert. Mr. Wallace.
these aren't the good old days, Moses.
they never were, Jack.
why wouldn't you give him ...- Huh-uh.
if You were to just... - Not now.
Ashford doesn't come here easily.
he didn't have anything specific or actual either.
ignore it. I'm not insulting Tilman with this.
Yeah, it's Jack.
can you come on over?
why weren't you more specific? - You have a source to protect.
I was that vague, you fired me.
do you know...how pervasive this is?
are you think they're involved?
I don't know who's involved, and neither do you.
than why did we even come here?
Levon Wallace, city's best investigator.
if the story holds up he'll confirm it.
what do we do now?
I publish coupons. You should look for a job.
Mr. Ashford...- Look, kid.
you've got a story, access to the D. A. and his best investigator.
if you can't make a career of that you don't belong in this business.
Mr. Ashford.
stop the Mister. Okay? I'm outta this game.
and your late night visits irk me.
if Wallace confirms your story, then you have to put the question to Tilman, Lazerov, and Deed.
use a phone. And pray they don't take the call.
Moses!
look, kid. It's Friday.
go do what you're supposed to do. Go get laid, for christ sake.
outta the way. - I wasn't doin' a thing.
Yeah, whatever.
look out. - All right!
Hey. Just here to dance.
have a good time.
what?
Oh, my God. . . poppy.
Pollack.
who's that? - He's a reporter.
we have to go.
Why? - We have to go.
that's the guy from your story. - Shh.
he's kinda cute, right?
are you dating other people?
don't worry. Looks like he just got engaged.
I saw that. Tough break for you.
you never put a face on it，do you? Once published, it will ruin his life.
I'm not ruining his life.
I said your story. God, it is always about you, right?
I do think about that. Okay.
I think about ruining somebody's life.
you're not gonna get self-absorbed and mopey?
"don't get all soft and mopey..."
Hey, what are you doing?
what happened? - Come on. Move it!
get outta the way!
move! Move!
don't move, help's comin' .
Aw, fuck.
officer Deed, Edison P. D. I have 2 down outside the Plaza Nightclub.
I have a medical bracelet here.
it says serum prothrombin conversion, blood type O.
stay still, buddy. Help's comin' .
she needs help. - I know. Stay still.
you okay?
Yeah.
hell. Shit.
Wallace?
you ever answer your fucking phone?
you?
I've been up all night.
Pollack got the shit kicked up last night, so did Willow.
what? Who?
his girlfriend. They're in the hospital.
how bad?
she's in a coma.
she's got factor seven deficiency. It's a blood disorder.
they don't know how she's gonna survive.
and Pollack?
took a beating but he'll be all right.
mugged?
warned.
who are you?
deed. Edison P. D. Who are you?
you don't wanna be here. - Who are you?
moses Ashford, I own the paper he works for.
how bad Is he? - He's banged up.
sedated. Do you care?
tell him somethin'? - Tell him What?
tell him I have nothing to do with this.
with what? - You gonna Tell him or not?
officer Deed.
is there any hope for you, son?
no.
let go.
what are you doin'? - Go me.
it's not safe for him here.
move him somewhere safe.
come in.
make yourself as comfortable as you can.
the market will deliver. It's on Wallace's tab.
you have run of the house, but, no matches.
no fire at all near the barn. - You told me.
all that dry hay could catch fire.
this place has been in Wallace's family for years.
why do I have to stay here?
you don't have to stay here. Take a plane, go home to mommy.
I wanna be near Willow.
believe me, it's safer both of you if you're here.
when I publish.
you can't publish.
why not? - Look at what they did to me!
serious journalism doesn't look so good up close, huh?
it's a little hard to tell with this large thing hanging over my eye, thanks.
so who's a fraud now?
you know what? You don't even know what it's like.
life's a bitch, ain't it?
think you can swim, then it's oh shit, where are my water wings?
this isn't from swimming pool.
no, this is what you aspire to.
you want a prize? Here's your shot.
see when you asked Charles to tell you his story you committed.
now you have a moral duty. People depending on you.
doesn't get any better than that, kid.
Hey, why are you doin' this to me?
cause you did it to me. I'll call you later.
how can I help you, Frank?
why were you at that club?
yoga, exercises, aerobics. What do you think? I was dancin' .
Dancin'?
Yeah. It's a dance club, Frank.
I'm fuckin' James Brown. Watch me.
Ow! - Yeah, I feel good.
I got soul. - Neck bones, candy ass.
right, Right, right. right. - Oh.
after You clocked out. . . - Hm?
Tilman got a call. - right.
that Herald reporter was makin' noise at the Hall.
nothin' hardcore but he had to come to Jesus.
the girl need one, too?
I didn't know she had bad blood.
I figured She was a bonus. - right.
gave him a sermon, he's pissed chapter and verse the girlfriend.
he won't be gettin' dumb now. - Yeah.
this is from Tilman.
you gotta worry. - right.
Pollack. The kid's got nothin' .
his source.
who?
your Jesus buddy got shanked at Longworth.
drive safe.
fuck.
who the hell told you?
Lazerov said it came from you. I went to the hospital, went in there.
and I saw a some guy, I don't know who it was.
and I was Deed. Deed was talking to him I left.
Lazerov said? When did that start?
please, give me a break.
give you a break? - You know what Lazerov said...
can you over the hospital he's taking you and Wu to the hospital, nobody's calling me, nobody's saying anything.
I thought you knew. It's not up to me.
how do I know?
Oh, shit.
Well,thank you.
thanks for dropping by and laying this shit on me.
hospital security.
Lazerov? - You got that For me?
Yeah, Pollack was released to Wallace and Ashford.
What'd you get?
nothin' that can't be mitigated.
except maybe the photos, taken before help arrived.
and there's a bad news.
Charles Is dead. - What?
knifed at Longworth.
great. If Charles is dead, we got nothin' .
we got a bigger problem.
frat collars dealers with drugs, guns, flesh.
guilty verdicts.
whatever FRAT confiscates, FRAT keeps.
$ 12 million cash in the past 5 years.
six million dollars for ordnance. Four million for surveillance.
Tilman overpays by two, three, 400 percent.
but take a look at who he's buying from.
surveillance from midland.
pc's from high tower. Arms from Phoenix.
Oh, Digi-Vector they built FRAT's website.
they own sports teams.
car dealerships. Retail chains.
city's leadership.
and the founders of the Better Edison Foundation.
when did this pop up?
it hasn't yet. Official opening's next week.
Reigert.
it's a political action committee.
the overpayments end up right here.
money laundering.
Yeah，well, we're not gonna find any memos on that.
you showed me the bones of a covert fascist state.
methodist Hospital.
Hi, I'm checking on a patient, Willow Summerfield.
are you a relative?
I'm a friend. I was in the hospital with her.
Oh. One moment.
shit.
just spread it out here.
FRAT's basic profile.
Six-two, 200 plus pounds. Perfect rifle, pistol scores. . .
each one of 'em prior to joining FRAT had three physical. . .
fights in their jackets.
none are married, no kids.
the night Pollack was attacked, he was there.
why Is that a surprise. - He was with a girl.
she kept lookin' at an engagement ring like she just got it.
so two things.
you don't take your honey to a tune-up and FRAT don't marry.
come on.
I really like living alone，but I'm beginning to think. . .
what?
I think I need a woman in my life.
well, shit, don't look at me.
he's not answerin' .
you dialed the wrong number.
I know my number, I dialed it twice.
he's gone.
motherfucker!
damn it. Why don't I call the County Sheriff?
the County Sheriff is Tilman's duck hunting partner.
there. There.
Josh !
what the fuck are you doing?
Lazerov was at the farm! I blew up that bastard's car.
you blew up his car.
he was gonna kill me.
Jesus Christ.
Well,Tilman'll rein Lazerov in for goin' to my house but it doesn't mean you're safe. He's homicidal.
he's killed 6 in the line of duty.
six? And he's still wearing a badge?
that was 15 years ago when Edison was the murder capital of America.
when our biggest industry was the production of crystal meth and when drive-bys were a sport. That was before you came back.
did you see Deed give a girl an engagement ring?
Yeah. Why is that important?
no member of FRAT's ever been married.
so?
it may be the only hook we have to hang our hat on.
Isiaha Charles can...- Charles's dead.
what? - He was knifed in prison.
Jesus Christ.
your work ever ruin a life?
did it?
you do this job right you'll ruin lives, celebrate murderers.
they'll give you a Pulitzer Prize for it.
I need you to reach out to Deed.
look, you don't have to do this with your life.
but if you're going to, now is when you decide.
who Is this? - It's Pollak.
what the fuck do you want it?
meet me at Blunts.
damn, Francis, you are outta control.
you are outta control, Francis.
I thought you said you wanted fear of God put in this guy.
so you thought that extended to his girlfriend?
I just thought.
no, you didn't think. You acted on impulse.
I've had to preach to a spouse, but only after due consideration.
do consideration.
you enlisted Marilyn, Wu and you went to that hospital on impulse!
and now this!
the fuckin' punk was writin' a story about me.
there is no story, Francis!
it's a bunch of allegations made by a convicted felon who is dead.
and that's where it woulda stayed had you not dragged it to the front door of Lee Wallace's family farm.
instead of a kid makin' his first foray into the world of journalism.
I got a seasoned investigator up my ass probing FRAT business.
this is gonna require all my attention.
until it's resolved, you're desk-bound.
you're takin' Wallace's side?
no.
he's a fuckin' poser.
rodeo clown with Santa Fe string tie bullshit.
gimme a break. I've done everything you asked me to do.
Yes.
he pissed on the idea of FRAT since the beginning.
that's politics.
15 fuckin' years I'm on the streets.
gettin' rid of the cancer that was killin' this town !
fifteen years ago, Edison needed brute force to survive.
now, it needs finesse, hardly your strong suit!
I've done everything.
every fuckin' thing that you asked me to do.
Yes.
and now what?
you're gonna throw me in the fuckin' garbage?
I'm on your side. Let's just go get in the car.
it's not fuckin' right you takin' his side.
I'm on your side.
it's not right you takin' his side.
I'm not. . .
it's not fuckin' right you takin' his side!
it's not fuckin' right!
Francis.
you're my guy, you're number one with me.
since day one. What are you doin'?
you're my guy okay?
let's get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
straight up?
that's no bullshit.
let's just go get in the car, all right?
and cut the shit.
let's get in the car. - I'm sorry. I just need to sleep.
Yeah.
smooth operator.
I'm in the book.
your line may be tapped.
are you?
no.
I'm not wired.
you're shakin' .
Well,I'm scared shitless.
I didn't do that to you.
now where are they?
down the street.
and who are they?
you should teach.
what?
you said you needed a woman.
the only guys your age I know. . .
havin' sex regularly are college professors.
this is who I am.
when's it hit the paper?
an officer of the court wants to believe this story.
an aberration in a life that has a chance of having value.
man, my life is over.
come on. - What?
let's go on back.
sit down. Have a seat.
let's go.
what do you mean your life is over?
you have a beautiful fiance.
Yeah.
so you'd walk from that for prison?
I'm not seein' a lotta options.
the guys out there. . .
they think you got caught up in this before you knew what it was.
I knew.
they think you can get immunity.
they want you to tell your story to a superior court judge.
force Reigert and Tilman to resign.
Edison'll clean up its own mess.
you think the court's not involved?
Un-fucking-believable.
is anybody not corrupt in this town?
I don't know. . . you?
if it goes to justice. . .
be the guy to take it. - Why?
Well，I thought you were in love.
she can do better.
can you?
I was studyin' plumbin' when you called.
I mean. . . - Nice.
you know, I like to think about that comin' home to Maria huggin' my children.
just livin' a normal life.
Wha's up?
what happened to her.
she didn't deserve this. - You're right.
it was a righteous offer.
this is gonna get ugly.
no, no. Let him go.
just got a call from Hanson at FBI.
justice is setting up a task force.
sturm und drang.
if they had anything, they'd be arresting, not searching.
and will they find anything?
this isn't connected to you. - You're connected to me.
and you're under a microscope.
because of your. . . your reckless behavior.
the girl's picture will be everywhere tomorrow.
Wallace and Ashford already know somethin's up.
if that kid's article links me and Better Edison to
I am the reason that this city is what it is.
this? This doesn't get near to you.
Yeah，well. . . I wish I had your certainty.
FBI. This is a Federal warrant.
we're taking all FRAT evidence files.
in my office.
they have impounded your car. Or what's left of it.
anything that you need to tell me right now, Laz?
no, Captain.
sit on it then, till O-one hundred.
go.
goddamn phones everywhere.
fuckin' yid from the Herald.
you don't know that. - Bullshit. He was makin' noise.
and you with your Jesus, Jesus, Jesus beggin' to be looked at.
you say anything to Maria?
you flap your lips and she could come to Jesus, too.
get his keys.
and call nine-one-one.
Tilman shot Lazerov.
Lazerov's dead.
apparently Lazerov attempted to shoot Deed. Tilman intervened.
Well，Tilman just served up.
dammit.
come on. No, wait, Lee.
what's the point, Moe? - Wait a minute.
forget it, Moe! Forget the whole thing.
this isn't going anywhere.
bullshit.
Pollack! - This shit isn't over.
what are you doing?
Isiaha's dead. Willow's in a fucking coma?
I'll publish myself if I have to copy it at Kinko's and pass it out on the street corner.
it's a fucking disaster. A fucking disaster! !
we were on the short list for the Republican Convention.
the summer fucking Olympics! !
and now we're look at a Federal consent decree?
there's a dead body outside my fucking office! !
the fuck are we gonna do?
it kinda puts a little crimp in your Better Edison thing, doesn't it?
we gotta do something about him, Lee.
who, Tilman?
well. . . there it is. You know. Yeah.
what about you, Jack?
huh? Me?
Yeah，you.
what are we gonna do about you?
well. . . I'll be fine. Thanks for asking.

Rafe?
Rafe?
Yeah, I'm out here!

Hey, why are you doin' it?
death benefits.
what' this?
it's the rest of your story.

Rafe. Come in.
Hey, Rafe. - Wha's up, man?
Rafe. Sit down.
this is a police file photo Pollack's girlfriend at the Lazerov's come to Jesus talk.
and there it is. The enemy you can't beat a photograph.
Ashford's printing this as a tease to polics story on FRAT.
so we say Charles is a liar.
he'd say anything to go home and visit his dying mother, right?
whatever discrepancies there are between his testimony and what's actually in the police locker will be offset when the Feds find the drugs we planted in 's house.
you rammed the door to compromise its security.
keep the junkies from using the place as a shooting gallery.
Lazerov was unstable.
so the Feds' will buy that.
all that's left is Pollack.
Pollack?
he's a kid.
justice needs the case closed.
so we give 'em.
herald needs its advertisers, I can handle that.
but this kid pollack?
this kid polic is like a pup with a bone.
he doesn't wanna hear there's no meat on it, he just keeps gnawin' and gnawin' and gnawin' .
so. . .
polic has to see the man.
it's a partner's duty.
to Laz?
to Laz.
What?!
what? What?
you know what.
you know exactly what.
you're the only one that can put an end to this now.
I go to Justice, what I'm dealing with threatens the people I love.
what's the matter with you?
you're havin' an argument with yourself.
don't talk to me like I was - I said It was a righteous offer. . .
but I'm not takin' it.
you're not listening.
I'm not talkin' about my offer.
I didn't say go to justice.
I said you're the only one who can put an end to this. Didn't I?
Yes,you did
Yes,you did.
Hello, you've reached the answering machine for. . .
moses Ashford.
please leave a message at the tone.
Hey, it's Josh. You're not gonna believe this.
I just got a hold of the evidence we need on FRAT.
listen, I don't wanna talk over the phone, but...
moses, you're gonna wanna see this.
I'm layin' out the story now and then I'll email it to you.
Oh, and I'm also Fed-Ex'ing hardcopies to all the big papers.
I'll talk to you later.
you've got email.
right.
Yes, I know.
Yeah, I emailed it last night but I'll mail a hardcopy to be safe. . .
so let me get your address right now.

open fire!
go! Go! Go! - What?
go! Go!
go to the warehouse!
look out!
fuck! Fuck!
jeez.
hold your fire!
you hear me,Deed?
let's stop all this alright? We don't have to do this.
all I want is the kid.
you hear me? All I want is that kid.
tell him whatever it is, you won and we can come to an extremely agreeable solution here.
same deal you gave Lazerov?
motherfucker.
the fuck is wrong with you!
let's finish this thing.
you go. I'll light this up!
move! Move!
drop 'em.
get up. Get up.
he's down !
Hey，Rafe! Come on out now.
it's over! I got your boy here.
come on, Rafe. Get out where I can see you, Rafe.
I'll kill him now I don't see you!
get out a here!
we're finished. It's over we're done.
you're goddamn right it's over.
put It down. - FRAT's over.
everybody's dead.
everybody's dead because of you!
because you couldn't do what you were supposed to do.
put a bullet in this fucker and his story.
Well，you do it now, Rafe.
put a bullet in his fuckin' head. Do what I tell you.
we walk away, forget about this shit.
you kill him.
right now you do as you're told.
do it! You do it!
because if you don't, I will.
duck. - What?
keep your door locked, kid.
now not for another 15 minutes.
don't say anything. I'll be there in a minute.
where have you been?
laying out Polllack's story.
Yeah, well, the story changed.
and Deed wasn't here.
detective Wallace. D. A. Reigert's here.
Tilman?
why are they here?
they're reporters.
the press is on the other side.
and material witnesses to the dissension in FRAT.
right.
not much for the FBI to work with, is there?
No，they'll probably close up shop.
this kind of story. . .
not really in the Herald's wheelhouse, is it Moses?
no it's not.
no.
Tilman have any last words?
well, there it is. Good day, gentlemen.
he said there was agreement between the D. A. 's office. . .
and judges regarding FRAT related prosecutions.
that the cash evidence from criminal trials wound up in the
better Edison Foundation for your political campaign.
that laundering this money was systematic.
that principals from Midland, Hightower and other companies were involved.
he said all that?
and that was unmitigated slander.
I'm gonna go with it if you run for any elected or appointed office in this state.
broke as you are, you think that's a smart thing to do?
now, Jack, did I get broke doin' the smart thing?
in the night, when no reporters were around to cover it
Wallace removed all evidence of Better Edison.
will are recovered.
indeed, he got into another line of work.
it would have violated a sacred trust to turn him in to the law.
and the law already knew.
justice is a lot like journalism.
sometimes the most important questions are the ones you decide not to ask.
so even if Columbus got lost and wasn't the first to discover America he's still my hero
he was really brave to sail such a tiny ship over a really big ocean and because of him we get Columbus Day off of school
thank you, Heather
Ronnie, tell us about your hero
what's he writing?
hachiko was my Grandfather Wilson's dog
everyone called Hachi a mystery dog because they never really knew where he came from
maybe Hachi escaped from a dog pound
or maybe he jumped out of somebody's car, from someplace far away like Florida or New Jersey
but no matter how, Hachi was lost
Hey, it's a little puppy
but no matter how it happened
a long time ago in the town my grandfather lived in
Hachi appeared at the train station
and that's where their story began
no, no, I'll walk
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye
Hey, buddy. Are you lost?
come here
you got lost here, bud?
someone must be looking for you
this guy was wandering around
Really? Out on the platform?
on the platform, yeah
well, good for you for finding him
yeah
well, I'll tell you what
this crate was out there
it was broken. I don't know what's going on but anyhow, someone's gonna be here for him'
so if you'll just hold him here...
you just hold him till they come
no, I can't do that
I can't do that, professor
well, he was out there. No one's gonna leave this dog
no, I know that
I know no one's gonna leave it. They'll be back for it so you take him with you
and when anyone shows up. I'll tell them that you have him
someone's gonna be here
they're gonna come for him
no, you don't understand. I'm gonna have to put this in here for like the whole night if nobody comes
if they're not here...
I'll lock him in here and he'll be safe for the night but all I can do is take him to the pound in the morning
good thing it's Friday
we'll find out where you're headed and until then you can stay with me
all right
sit right here. Sit right here
okay, yeah. Okay
okay
stay, stay.
chew on those, it's okay.
stay.
Hello, handsome. Hi.
Hi. How'd it go?
it was great.
good.

not a bit. You?
no. Didn't think about you once.
I have a little surprise.
Yeah, well...I have a little surprise for you, too.
come on. We have some catching up to do.
Yeah.
catching up. I can't wait to catch up.
did you hear something?
that was a branch against the window.
I ran into this interesting situation at the station tonight.
why don't you tell me about it in the morning?
how does that sound?
it's okay, okay, okay, it's all right
Parker!
we had an agreement. I know, I know.
or did you forget?
no, I didn't forget.
no, it was-- He was at the train station just kind of lost
Carl was gonna send him to the pound tomorrow I thought...
you just thought you'd bring him home and talk me into keeping him?
right? I don't wanna keep him, I don't.
tomorrow morning I'm getting up and I'll find out exactly where he belongs, okay?
I promise you, I will do that.
all right. This was Luke's stuff.
okay, okay
okay, here you go. In there.
there you go.
now look...
...lots of Luke's stuff here.
that's warm. You got that
it's pretty cold.
you want this? Yeah? This was Luke's favorite
okay, here's your water.
some story you could tell, huh?
couldn't you?
Yeah.
okay, buddy.
that's better.
good night, buddy
you know, you're the one who should be in the doghouse.
I promise I won't bite your toe
puppy! Puppy!
Hey, puppy! Puppy! Puppy, come on!
that's good.
good puppy.
dad, I love him.
does he have a name yet?
Yes, he does. "Temporary Guest."
you have to keep him.
dad, the house feels so empty since Luke's been gone.
ask your mother.
mom?
yeah?
could you come here, please?
look, he even likes your music.
I can't believe it! This is a wonder dog!
I absolutely have to keep this dog.
no more dogs.
don't encourage him.
I won't.
you're so mean.
dad, he's gonna jump out of that. Here.
Oh, yeah, that's great.
try this. I love it.
does he fit?
you in there, bud?
Yeah!
Yeah, that's good. I like it.
great.
so you saw Michael last night?
Yeah. We drove over to the look-out' watched the comets.
it was beautiful.
very romantic.
it was.
are You the...
can I help you with something? Yeah, yeah.
I just found this little guy at the station last night.
can you board him until we find his owner?
board him? No, we can't board him.
this isn't a boarding service. It's a pound, pal.
look, I just found him. What am I gonna do with him?
let's see him.
he's cute. That'll help with adoption but...
we give it two weeks.
two weeks?
Yeah. We're packed.
excuse me.
I'll call you next week then. All right. Bye-bye
morning, Mary Anne
how you doing, Parker?
I'm doing great. I was wondering if I could ask you for a favor.
sure, anything.
look at this!
Hey, little one! Hello. Hello!
Oh, he's gorgeous! Where'd you come from?
he was wandering around the station last night
Hi, sweetheart.
I don't know, it's very strange.
Really? He's adorable.
I just want to put that up.
okay, fine, fine.
window?
Yeah, right over there.
any one of those.
Parker, this dog is just fabulous.
you wouldn't be interested, would you?
what, the puppy?
a fine young puppy like that.
what do you think, Antonia?
new roommate?
Oh, no! Antonia!
morning, Mr. Professor.
one sugar, two cream, coming up.
Hey, what have you got there?
I got a new friend here. You want a dog?
I prefer cash.
he'd be a great guard dog for you, wouldn't he?
guard dog to guard the hot dogs?
I don't think so.
I don't think so, either.
seriously, man, why you want a dog?
everyday you have to walk him, feed him.
clean him, pick up the poop
how many of these can I have for him?
on the house.
too much trouble.
Yeah, you're right.
thank you, Jess.
my pleasure.
Hey, any news?
no. Nobody came, nobody showed up, nobody called.
nobody?
strange. Really strange.
can you hold him a second?
Yeah.
you're cute.
I made up some flyers. Would you put that up for me?
come on.
all right, I'll put them up for you.
what a sweetheart you are.
I know, I know, I know.
come on.
he really likes being in the bag.
Thanks.
professor, no dogs on the train.
no dogs on the train.
thank you.
okay, hold on a second. Let me show you something.
you skip the repeat of the first section and go directly to the lyrical section.
okay. Let's try that.
but it means you gotta build up quicker' you know, up tempo.
and when we get to the lyrical section, just...
...big breaths, big breaths.
don't forget to breathe.
that's great.
do you want a puppy?
you want a puppy?
this was the only thing left on the crate.
yamanashi.
that's all I can read.
what's that?
it's a part of central Japan.
no ordinary dog, Parker.
no.
it's an Akita, or Akita, as you'd say./
it's a very special breed.
what is that?
Hachi.
what?
it's Japanese for "eight."
...number of good fortune.
Oh, good fortune.
very nice.
Hachi. Hachi.
that's a good name. I like that.
he might have been born eighth in a litter.
spiritual significance in number eight...
...reaches up to Heaven comes down to earth.
so what do you think? Do you want him?
me?
no.
I think he's made his choice.
meaning what?
well, meaning he's your problem not mine, brother.
you're not a problem, are you?
well...
...whether you found him or...
...he found you, who's to say?
it's meant to be.
he was also saying that the Shoguns bred these Akitas for combat and hunting.
so I guess in a way they're kinda dog royalty.
did Ken give you any ideas where you could find this royal dog a home?
I put up ten flyers already.
you know, someone's gonna claim Hachi.
who's Hachi?
this.
that's what was on his collar. That's the symbol
you named him? No, I didn't.
Parker, You want to keep him.
no, I do not. You do.
I don't want to keep him.
admit it. You do.
I wasn't even thinking about this -Yes.
Hachi?
Where'd you go?
Oh, no!
Oh, God!
Parker, that's months of hard work!
I'm sorry
I want him to stay out there all night, Parker. He's not coming back in do you hear me?
end of discussion.
I hear you. I hear You
I heard you before. I hear you right now
Hachi.
come on, buddy. Come on.
Yeah, you're coming inside.
let's go.
okay.
see if I can find you here.
Yeah, there you are.
your bloodline goes back at least 4'000 years...
maybe much more.
Yeah.
what else we got here?
Yeah.
you like that?
it says the first partnership between man and animals was you
did you know about that?
did you know that already?
you did, didn't you? Yeah, you did.
shut this down.
let's see if we can settle you down now?
Hey, this looks pretty good, huh?

Hello?
Oh, the puppy flyers, yes.

he's out back
the grill's ready?
it's getting there yeah. Nice to see you
you too
Yeah, that'd be great, hon
you know, I actually took guitar lessons for a little bit when I was a kid
did you? Yeah, like when I was 9 or 10 years old
I had to stop because my brother slammed my fingers in the car door
I mean, he always said it was an accident but after that, I just...
I don't know, I stopped practicing I wish I didn't, though...
because I really love music and you know'
I have so much respect for musicians and people who play instruments
Michael.
do you love my daughter?
Yes, sir. Yes, I do
well, that's good...
cause that's what you want to remember on the bad days
right
Hachi, this is Michael
Michael, Hachi
pleased to meet you
Hachi, hey, you wanna play a little catch?
yeah? Ready? Okay, go get the ball
go get it!
there it is! Get the ball
it's right there. Go!
Hachi, go get it
go! Go get the ball. Go get it
Michael, you want to get that ball back, you're gonna have to get it yourself
Hachi doesn't fetch
he doesn't do it
okay
are You All right? Are You okay? Totally good, totally good
honey, are you okay
keep playing
are you sure? Totally. I'm gonna get the ball
okay
I'm good
look at that
don't let me disrupt the game
okay
are you all right?
are You okay?
he was just distracting you there
if I threw the ball just one foot, go get it, okay?
Really? Even if I just toss it right here, he's not gonna get it?
you're not?
fetch?
fetch, right
I throw, he brings it back. He won't do it
not Akitas, Parker
what, do they have something against fetching?
no. You want a dog that fetches you get a Collie, you get a Springer Spaniel
Hachi's fine with me. I'm okay
well, good, because Akitas are not into people-pleasing
what are they into?
he comes to the train because he has a special connection with you "Here, buddy. Go get that ball."
why would he do that?
for fun?
for a cookie?
because it'd make me happy, basically
they can't be bought
they're Japanese, not American
well, if he's gonna fetch...
...it'll be for a very special reason
I'll find a reason
no, no, no, Hach, come on. You can't go
