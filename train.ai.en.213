exactly. Oh, boy.
exactly. Okay, great. Thanks. Bye.
exactly. Okay, they're just sitting at the table, betting the table min,
exactly. Okay. Bump me.
exactly. Once they go through here, they'll have a much better idea of where they're headed.
exactly. Or on the beach. Under a towel.
exactly. Our job is to find out which.

exactly. So I guess the question is,
exactly. So I guess the question is, what else causes birth defects?

exactly. So I'm thinking,
exactly. So either they're wrong or...
exactly. So here's what we're gonna do.
exactly. So how do we get it back?

exactly. So let me help.
exactly. So make it quick.
exactly. So our poetry has to echo the rhythm of the 20th century which is...
exactly. So simmer down and let me save it!

exactly. So there's three people down here shooting.
exactly. So these elephants
exactly. So these elephants
exactly. So we think alike.
exactly. So we think alike.
exactly. So we've gotta get this John Wang guy right out of the way.
exactly. So what's the op?
exactly. So why don't you walk us through it?
exactly. So why is she -
exactly. So why not for cycling, too?
exactly. So why play out someone else's fantasy?
exactly. So you can't speak about me.
exactly. So you can't speak about me.
exactly. So you'd be more wrapped up in beating her than taking the mark.
exactly. So, his car proceeds on down the line,
exactly. So, his car proceeds on down the line, and then inside the tunnel, someone, presumably our killer, stashes the knife, breaks the taillight.

exactly. So, no, I'm not gonna be your wingman
exactly. So, what's the plan? How do we get the money?
exactly. So...
exactly. Sorry, man.
exactly. Stay with your chief witness, inspector.
exactly. Tells me the shooting of the five noches by the pool was done by an outsider.
exactly. Ten years ago, justice, big name.

Excalibur Almaz's bulky space stations will need a lot more work to convert into lunar spacecraft. The first step will be to attach engines. The company plans to use ion thrusters, a high-tech propulsion system in which propellant is ejected using an electric field. Such motors are extremely efficient, and can be powered from a station's solar panels. But they generate little thrust, meaning that Excalibur Almaz's mission will take at least six months, compared with just six days for Space Adventures' chemical-powered craft. In fact, the low-energy trajectory planned by Excalibur Almaz will take its crew members farther from the than any other humans have been.
