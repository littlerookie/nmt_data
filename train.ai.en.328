mr wolfowitz's bid to crack down on corruption suffered a blow in september when big aid donor countries forced him to agree to consult the bank's executive board before taking any specific decision to cut lending to countries where corruption is endemic.
mr wolfowitz's crass favouritism was, at best, a case of extremely poor judgment.
mr wolfowitz's crusade at the world bank is based on the idea that corrupt countries fail to develop.

mr xi and china's other leaders all appear to be graduates of the strait-laced technocratic school of chinese politics.
mr xi comes at a crucial moment for china, when hardliners still deny the need for political change and insist that the state can put down dissent with force.
mr xi had previously served in high-level party and government positions in zhejiang and fujian provinces, and in the city of shanghai.
mr xi has largely clung to the centre ground in these debates, so far as public pronouncements reveal them.
mr xi is probably much more aware of these deficiencies than his western admirers: it is a tough inheritance.

mr xiao frets that short-term products are financing long-term projects, creating a maturity mismatch.

mr xu admitted, for example, that the retail-sales numbers include some purchases by companies and the government, which should not be counted as consumption.
mr xu also noted that he had assumed leadership of a weekly economic analysis meeting, normally chaired by a vice-mayor, in an effort to cut red tape, lower taxes and reduce administrative fees for companies operating in the city.
mr xu and his neighbours are part of a national reverse migration of workers from the factories of the developed south and east, to become e-commerce entrepreneurs back home.
mr xu concurs: "in 2000, the market was closed and government regulation was very strict. But once the market changed in 2003, we had no competitive advantage and it was too late to take a new direction."

mr xu yesterday made a strenuous effort to contain the impact of the spreading scandal, which has already hurt shanghai electric's share price, saying the executives had left for "personal reasons."
mr xu's case is unusual in that his successor, wang rong, and the top party official in guangdong, wang yang, each received a foreign media delegation less than a month later, giving journalists an opportunity to press for answers.
mr xu, a division head in the powerful ministry, has already been found guilty of accepting bribes totalling$ 264000 and was sentenced last year to life imprisonment.

mr yanukovich may muster sufficient votes to oust ms tymoshenko as prime minister.
mr yanukovich would prefer to see an old comrade, nikolai azarov, as prime minister.
mr yanukovich's legitimacy is now accepted by the world's leaders, and not just by russia's prime minister, vladimir putin, who rashly congratulated him on his rigged victory in 2004.

mr yau admits he was naive when he started wagamama, too focused on the creative side of the business and not enough on how to "make a product much more of a formula, to make it into a square box" to allow it to expand easily.
mr yau explains how he tried a couple of high street banks in london, but "I had no track record and the concept was alien to them."
mr yau's successes are very much a product of those times and of a businessman's good timing.
mr yeandle said the ratings reflect growing concerns about the business and tax environment in london, as well as rising enthusiasm for asia and a concerted effort by chinese authorities to reach out to foreigners and improve their standing, particularly on regulation issues.
mr yeh said he thought taiwan would now be invited every year.
mr yelburton will see you now.

mr yip said the dinner was intended to allow mr gates and mr buffett to get to know friends and exchange ideas about partners interested in charity, not to convince chinese tycoons to make donations.
mr yip said top-down analysis should take precedence in greater china.
mr yip says the government, whose approval rating has been sliding, wants to reduce discontent over its housing policy as property prices surge.
mr yosano added that such measures could include setting up a government body to buy shares in the market.
mr yosano may be a good model.
mr yosano said he was concerned that as japan emerged from a prolonged period of weakness a reaction against reform was occurring.

mr yu's 35-year-old daughter worked as a contract worker at the foreign ministry from 2006 to 2009.

mr yudhoyono also wants to improve the lot of soldiers, with higher salaries and benefits.

mr yudhoyono has not met his promise in 2004 of halving the number of people living below the government's poverty line.
mr yudhoyono must also take some personal credit for his position.
mr yudhoyono was recently feted in india, where he signed$ 15 billion-worth of trade deals.
mr yudhoyono's former diffidence makes his new posture all the more striking.
mr yudhoyono's government has also taken its own initiatives.
mr yudhoyono's government has been weak-kneed in confronting such groups, perhaps because he fears that voters would see a crackdown as unislamic.
mr yudhoyono's previous finance minister, sri mulyani indrawati, made a start on this.

mr yunus and grameen succeeded by seizing an idea, expanding quickly, proselytising and resisting the temptation to move beyond the poor.
mr yunus denies all the charges against him but has made powerful enemies among bangladesh's politicians.
mr yunus foresees social businesses bringing clean water, renewable energy and health insurance to the impoverished masses.
mr yunus has long had an uneasy relationship with bangladesh's prime minister, sheikh hasina, who is said to resent his nobel prize-especially since he briefly considered starting a rival political party during a period of military rule a few years ago.
mr yunus insisted the move was political and lodged an appeal.
mr yunus should be proud.
mr yunus was no doubt familiar with microfinance innovations in other countries: bri in indonesia had transformed itself from a wreck into a huge success by emphasising savings, not credit, and other institutions had started to abandon group lending.
mr yunus's aides say the members of the grameen family are all independent entities with no legal ties to each other.
mr yurgens likened the policy to the "beggar thy neighbour" protectionist policies of the 1930s.
mr yushchenko and ms tymoshenko are expected to contest a presidential election in the coming year, and both are playing politics while the sickly economy gets sicklier.
mr yushchenko certainly has ideology and vision.
mr yushchenko had earlier accused the prime minister, yulia tymoshenko, of treason for not criticising russia's attack on georgia.

mr zheng says he prefers to borrow from friends and relatives through the wenzhou shadow financing system at 1.5 per cent a month.
mr zheng says such resistance is common among patriarchs of chinese family businesses.

mr zhou had some advice for western governments.
mr zhou has come under attack on numerous fronts in recent years from opponents and has felt personally frustrated by the opposition to many of his policies.

mr zhou then became a hero.
mr zhou used the sulphuric acid to produce fertiliser, turning the enterprise into the biggest compound fertiliser manufacturer in the northeast.
mr zhou's currency push has faced stiff resistance within the bureaucracy, but his opponents have been partly disarmed by the policy's success.
mr zhou's plan could win support from other emerging economies with large reserves. However, it is unlikely to get off the ground in the near future.

mr zhu said its olympic plan would mean shougang would "basically be in a shut-down state" for three months.
mr zhu's contempt at "that government-in-exile of his" almost splutters off the page: "it's all just a separatist political clique that betrays the motherland, with no legitimacy at all and absolutely no status to engage in dialogue with the representatives of the central government."
mr zhu's reformist zeal in the economic realm helped to foster the impression of a country willing to take considerable political risks in order to create a more market-driven economy.
mr zhu: of course, I have! It-s all around us!

mr zittrain fears that the rise of tethered appliances will inevitably chip away at the freedom of the internet and personal computing, which many take for granted.
mr zlitni's instincts are unknown, although he is said to be a moderniser.
mr zoellick added that private equity could also play a worthwhile role in the region's developing nations, along similar lines to the equity and infrastructure investments made by the international finance corporation, the world bank's private-sector arm.
mr zoellick himself argued that a new monetary system needed to be co-operative.
mr zoellick said he was trying to persuade tokyo not to cut further.
mr zoellick said the world economy had "leftover fragilities, for instance in central and eastern europe."
mr zoellick wants the existing bretton woods institutions to administer these schemes.
mr zoellick will have to convince donors that the bank's best work is often its least showy, filling in the gaps left by other aid-givers keen to boast about their own generosity.
mr zoellick's frank mea culpa sounded impressive, and the project has been suspended.
mr zolade still owns 25 per cent of the company.
mr zong also noted that the proliferation of non-jvs stemmed in part from a clash of cultures, as he grew frustrated with his french partner's relatively cautious approach towards expansion.
mr zong countered, the tribunal added, that mr yau in fact "had access to... all the financial information pertinent to the operation of the jvs."
mr zong denied all of danone's claims.
mr zong fought for years with danone, his joint venture partner in china, over the right to exploit the wahaha trademark.
mr zong has not denied the existence of the parallel network, but says danone reneged on their agreement by acquiring rival businesses in china.
mr zong heads wahaha, china's leading soft drinks company, which recently emerged largely victorious from its protracted global legal battle with danone, its former joint venture partner.
mr zong reflected philosophically on that joint venture, telling the ft that the main lesson of the dispute for foreign companies investing in china is that such partnerships should be struck on the basis of "equality and mutual benefit": "chinese people are very tolerant, but we refuse to be bullied."
mr zong said the terms of the joint venture were increasingly "unfair" to wahaha and accused danone of trying to take control of parts of the chinese group not included in the joint venture.
mr zong said wahaha might also source sugar overseas.
mr zong told the financial times in an interview that he was looking at partnerships with overseas companies to step up product sourcing from overseas because "foreign companies need markets and we need good products."
mr zong's popular pollen oral solutions especially a product known as "wahaha children's nutritious liquid" were the cornerstone of the wahaha group's success in the early and mid-1990s.
mr zong, 62, blends many of the strengths and weaknesses of his generation of hard-driving entrepreneurs.
mr zong, 66, is known as the "drinks king" of china: but he wants to be much more.
mr zong, a hard-driving entrepreneur, had almost total management control of the business.
mr zong, who resigned from the joint venture, has launched lawsuits in china.
mr zorin says this kind of social engineering is the key to understanding today's problem.
mr zou and other traders agree that light-coloured cars are not good sellers.
mr zu guttenberg has created a "structural commission" to suggest solutions.
mr zu guttenberg is paying too little attention to the lessons of germany's experiences in afghanistan and elsewhere, which show that military action in failed states is worth little without civilian complements like police-training and school-building.
mr zu guttenberg wants it to be "more professional, faster and more flexible" and able to "deploy our soldiers anywhere in the world," he told der spiegel.
mr zu guttenberg's ideas for conscription will be part of a reform package he is expected to propose in september.
mr zu guttenberg's resignation could help the cdu's rivals, if only because he will not campaign.
mr zubkov would then step down, perhaps for health reasons, and mr putin would automatically return as president without breaking the letter of the constitution.
mr zucker is wary about claiming that this will guarantee success.
mr zuckerberg admits that twitter caught facebook unawares, though he plays down its significance.
mr zuckerberg had "found a soul-mate in the far corners of the world."
mr zuckerberg is not just portrayed as ambitious, a reasonable trait in the founder of a start-up, but also as vengeful, vicious, duplicitous and devoid of even the most basic social skills.
mr zuckerberg refused to be interviewed for the book, so the narrative is missing a crucial perspective.
mr zuckerberg scoffed at reports that facebook messages could be a gmail killer and said google had created a really good product.
mr zuckerberg will flounder, however, when he ventures into china in 2012.
mr zuckerberg's latest mea culpa is unlikely to be his last.
mr zuckerberg's latest mea culpa is unlikely to be his last.
mr zuckerman believes that goods and services still travel much farther than ideas, and that the internet allows us to be "imaginary cosmopolitans."
mr zuckerman believes that goods and services still travel much farther than ideas, and that the internet allows us to be "imaginary cosmopolitans."
mr zuckermann summoned his chief cashier.
mr zukin says: "when the first few are resolved, that is going to create some important guidelines."
mr zukorlic at least enjoys the support of mustafa ceric, the leader of bosnia's muslims.
mr zukorlic's strident calls for autonomy are causing concern about this serbian borderland.
mr zuma also plans to bring back the apartheid-era's hated schools inspectors, but in future they will be called "assessors" and required to support teachers as well as criticise them.
mr zuma arrived with a mixed reputation.
mr zuma could be further weakened as rival factions jostle for position ahead of the party's five-yearly congress in 2012.
mr zuma has not been immune to this.
mr zuma has repeatedly promised to reform the system, but has never quite got around to it.
mr zuma has since backtracked, saying that it was the impact of theconstitutional court's decisions that would be assessed rather than its powers.
mr zuma himself recently called for a review of the powers of theconstitutional court, after a series of judgments deeming his appointments or decisions unconstitutional.
mr zuma is paying his dues to it. But the economic consequences of doing so are also obvious.
mr zuma is right that a trade relationship based mainly on supplying china with unrefined raw materials is undesirable "in the long term."
mr zuma is the anc's presidential candidate in elections expected in april, and could thus appear in court as head of state.
mr zuma may at last really mean to get tough with his recalcitrant neighbour to the north.
mr zuma recently set out five priorities: land redistribution; education; health; the fight against crime; and finding decent work for all south africans.
mr zuma still hasn't explained his vision, but his actions since he came to power suggest that it consists in paying off his political allies while cracking down on his critics.
mr zuma takes power at a hard time.
mr zuma's chances rest on three things: a court case, support within the anc, and the alternatives.
mr zuma's deputy, kgalema motlanthe, is second in the delegate count and has confirmed that he will also stand, despite recently telling foreign journalists that he was "not a politician" but merely had a "political attitude."
mr zuma, a major figure in mk, however, was apparently never a communist.
mr zuo said yesterday it would win one-third of china's 3g market by 2010 at the earliest.
mr zussino blames sickness in the harbour's barramundi, a local fish, on stress from invasions by freshwater barramundi during the floods.
mr zussino goes further. He reckons gladstone is destined to be australia's "industrial powerhouse of the eastern seaboard," and the development is too important to slow or stop.
