Papa.

he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
I'm teIIing you, I haven't been with a boy!
you Iiar! You are so fuII of sin that you can't admit the truth.
not even when your wickedness is in front of you for the worId to see.

Oh, yeah? Where do you work? -At the car wash.

they're the rivaI gang, right? - They'd kiII you.
Wow. You reaIIy Iive in a whoIe other worId, don't you?
no. You do.
you know, we shouId wait for James.
she's fine.
it's no big deaI.
I couIdn't sIeep aII night. She's my onIy daughter.
but Ernesto. You know what he's Iike.
he's buII-headed, but he's a good man.
give him time and he'II come around.
and meanwhiIe don't worry. She's safe with me.
Hey, boys.

Hey. - Carlos.
I can make tea. WouId you Iike some?
no, I'm straight. What's up with you?

did you see the boys pIaying basketbaII today?
Yes, I did. - Oh, my gosh.
ManueI had his head shaved. Did you see?
what did it Iook Iike? - HorribIe.
it Iooks Iike he has Ieukemia.
I think short hair is sexy.
but his head is so weird. He Iooks Iike E. T.
I think that boy's too skinny. He needs to put some weight on.
Hey. - Hi.
Hi. - Hi.
you ready? - Yeah.
I'II see you girIs Iater.
Bye.
I Iike them baId. Shaved. - Some guys can puII it off.
Yeah, weII, that's what I Iike.
so you moved in with your uncIe? Why did you do that?
it's cIoser to schooI. It means I can waIk.
it's not cIoser. - It is.
did you get in a fight with your dad?
was it about the Hummer Iimo?
come here.
I'm gonna have a baby.
Yeah, right. - I am.
you can't be.
I did the test. I did it twice.
who's the father? - You.
that's not possibIe.
I know.
but we never...- I know that.
but the baby's there and I've never been with anybody eIse.
you don't beIieve me.
did you hear that Maria EIena is moving to SyImar?

see how much they're asking for?
the neighborhood is sure changing, isn't it?
so fast.
here you are.
Carlos, get your feet off the sofa.
it's my house. I can do what I want. -It's my house now too.
fuck you.
I have to sIeep there and your boots are dirty.
so?
I know why you're here.
and I'm sorry you wasted your time.
I just think you two shouId taIk.
when she's ready to confess her sin, I'II taIk. Not untiI then.
Magdalena is very strong-headed. You know what she's Iike.
I used to know her.
she's stiII the same.
the girI I knew read the BibIe at night and sang in my church.
she didn't run around with boys and fornicate.
she didn't Iie to her father.
I don't think she's a Iiar.
it's true, Ernesto. She doesn't Iie.
a girI who hasn't been with a man doesn't end up with a baby. Period.
you're a Ioser.
smoking pot in the afternoon, watching cartoons.
look who's taIking, 1 4 and pregnant.
face it. Your Iife is over.
no, it isn't.
I'm gonna have my baby, go to schooI, do everything I pIanned to do anyway.
good Iuck.
want a hit? - No.
nobody beIieves you, huh?
about what? - About what? Come on.
no.
nobody beIieved me about anything.
that's because you're a Iiar, and a thief, and a pothead, and a gay.
so?
I read some stuff on the Internet. Why don't you check it out?
what stuff?
Oh, you know. Sex advice.
I don't need no sex advice.
just trying to heIp.
'is there any way to get pregnant if the man's sperm...
...gets onto the outside of the vagina but not inside?
signed, "Pregnant Virgin. "
dear Pregnant Virgin.
sperm are very determined beings...
...whose soIe reason to exist is to get inside the faIIopian tubes.
whenever sperm is sprayed near the vaginaI opening...
...there is a chance that they couId swim inside. "
see? - Fuck.
you stiII think it's someone eIse's? - I never did.
I mean, it's just weird, that's aII.
what are the chances? - I don't know.
my sperm must be pretty strong swimmers, huh?
shut up.
I mean, I onIy came on your Ieg. - Herman, stop.
did you show this to your dad?
why not?
and Iet him know how far we did go? Yeah, he'd Iove that.
Hey. - What?
if he's a boy, we can caII him Jesus.
Yeah.
I'm sure he'II be a great kid. - Or she.
we can make him a papoose and take him traveIing with us.
come here.
what are you doing Iater?
nothing. Got the day off.
want some?
there's no smoking in the house. It's the ruIe. It's not my ruIe.

Yeah, Iike six years oIder than me. You ass.
I gotta go.
I shouIdn't be taIking about age difference with you.
I'm Iike nine years oIder or something?

I don't reaIIy think about it, though.

Hey, come back! It's Iit. -Come back, come back.
yo, I'II be right back.
let me show you something.
who do you think they are?
I don't know.
that's your mother and Aunt Silvia. - No way.
it was taken out here in the yard, when I just moved in.

Yeah, right.

this is not the same as before.
it is! Our ruIes were if we have 3- ways, we're both there.
otherwise, if I'm at work in my office, that's cheating.
let's not do this.
do what? You're the one who's, Iike, cheating aII the fucking time.
I'm not cheating aII the time. Why do you keep accusing me of that?
what, are you Iove with him? - No, I'm not in Iove with him.
aII right? He's just some kid. I'm in Iove with you.
when she wouIdn't get changed for basketbaII，didn't you notice how big she was getting.
I heard that Herman moved to San Diego.
imagine having to Ieave town because of her.
this couId've happened to any of us.
I know how cIose I've come with Paco.
but at Ieast some of us are smart enough to take precautions.
HeIIo? Birth controI.
how far have you gone with ManueI?
at Ieast I'm not cIaiming to be a virgin when I'm carrying a baby.
is that what she's saying? -Yes.
Haii Mary, fuII of grace...
Hey, Magdalena.
you don't want to do that. Not unIess you have to.
what age did you Ieave schooI?
when I was 1 2. - WeII...
that was the way it was. We have to work for a Iiving.
but I hate it right now, though. I hate schooI. I hate Herman.
I hate this baby.
don't Ieave schooI. You wiII end up as menso as me.
you got a Ietter.
did you remember the toiIet paper? - No.
I knew you wouIdn't. - Then why did you ask?
is it in EngIish, Tio?
it's from a Iawyer.
'Pursuant to your Iease of the rear unit at 1 023 WaterIoo Street...
...you are hereby given 30 days notice of eviction.
you wiII be expected to vacate the premises by June 30, 2005. "
what's the matter?
Tio, they want us to Ieave.
the motherfuckers!
they want us to Ieave? Why?
Hey, puto!
Hey, puto, come out here, man!
fucking evict me, bitch?
get the fuck out here, puto! What, are you fucking scared now?
Hey, puto! Get the fuck out here! Fucking punk!
I toId him you were from JaIisco and guess what?
there's someone on the same fIoor from there too.
you aII right with these steps?
it's good. - He's fine.
wasn't there anything on the ground fIoor?
you heard the IandIord.
the eIevator's gonna be working again tomorrow.
it's not a probIem. Right, Tio? - No probIem.
it's not bad. It's not bad at aII.
look, you have a nice big window.
I'II fix you curtains. Buttercup yeIIow, to make it more cheerfuI.
needs a new coat of paint.
weII, you can do that for him. It'II take you aII of a day.
Tio, we're gonna have to put some of your stuff in storage...
...but I think it wiII be good to go through some of your things.
I aIways teII my friends what a gentIe man he is, what a sweet man.
who knew he couId be so stubborn?
nothing we show him is good enough. Nothing.
and when you try to taIk about it, he just doesn't hear.
he wouIdn't even Iook at the one Ernesto found for him.
you see?
but think how hard it must be.
twenty-eight years.
I've never been more than five years in one home.
that's you. You aIways want something bigger.
I don't know how he's going to sort through everything.
and then there are the dogs.
and Carlos, and Magdalena.
Hey.
you coId?
no. - Then what?
none of my cIothes fit me anymore.
can't you get your foIks to give you some money?
no.
if you toId them what happened... - Why shouId that be so important?
so they couId hoId their heads up in church?
so I can be a good girI again? It's so stupid.
I've got a shirt.
I don't want your smeIIy shirts. - It's extra Iarge. It's brand new.
house FOR RENT 2 BEDROOMS-BACKHOUSE NICE!
we're did aII the ceiIings, got rid of the cottage cheese.
fIoors are refinished.
the appIiances are new. Cupboards are new.
and that's Travertine tiIe. My partner put it in herseIf.
it's beautifuI.
and you say it's just you and your uncIe.
no, there are three of us. - It might be cramped for three.
it's fine. Do you take pets?
if it's nice feIIas Iike those guys, no probIem.
great.
it's $ 1 600 a month.
Wow.
sorry, but we've put a Iot of money into it.
that's what I figured.
you're not gonna make champurrado? - Not today.
wait tiII Iater. I'II heIp you out.
no, don't worry.
okay. See you Iater.
Yeah, so he came, hit me, did a hit and run...
...damaged this part, dented this.
I have to repIace this and this. I don't know how I'm gonna do it.
don't even worry about it. I got a guy who'II take care of it.
Carlos, go do the Mustang. - It's gonna be hard to take care of.
let me show you what we got. - Okay.
it was just what we needed.
Yeah, we just Iaid around, went shopping a IittIe.
no, I Iove PaIm Springs too.
it's better now. Gary seems happier. He's starting a new job.
Yeah, he just... -- He had too much time on his hands.
what the fuck are you doing, Carlos?
get him.
Hey. What happened?
did you get into another fight? - Yeah.
I'II get some iodine.
here. Sit down. I'II put some ice on it.
you idiot.
I Iost my job. - Great.
I needed to get out of there, anyway. Shitty job.
I thought it was your chosen career. -Shut up.
I'm getting a reaI job in TV as a PA.
with your boyfriend?
fuck you. - HoId stiII.
I'm gonna have to make more money if we're gonna get a new pIace.
I've been thinking. Herman's not coming back.
someone's gotta take care of that kid and be a father to him.
might as weII be me.
I'm gonna get a reaI job.
one that's not a totaI fucking dead-end.
and you can stay in schooI, and Tio Tomas can babysit.
Yeah, right. - I'm serious.
Yes, I'm caIIing about the apartment.
Oh, that's too bad. Yes. AII right, thanks.
I know. I know. It's unbeIievabIe. HoId on. HoId on.
I caIIed about the apartment.
sorry, it's just been rented.
how oId are you? - AImost 1 5.
and how oId is your uncIe? -Eighty-five.
I don't think it's gonna work out, chica.
the front unit's aIready been taken, but there's a pIace in the back.
I can Iet you have it for 400.
look. I gotta think about the doIIars and cents here.
I have appIications from quaIified professionaIs who want to rent it.
the whoIe neighborhood is the same.
everyone who moves in is, weII, white.
does he work, your uncIe?
not reaIIy. He seIIs champurrado.
that IittIe guy with the cIown's horn? My God, is he stiII around?
Yeah, he's doing great.
he gave me free champurrado once. I don't beIieve this.
apart from a great sense of continuity with the past, what eIse is there?
you mean money? - Yeah.
the stuff that doesn't grow on trees, makes the worId go around.
weII, Carlos is unempIoyed right now...
...but he's angIing for a job in TV that pays reaIIy, reaIIy weII.
but Iook, if he does your gardening, that saves you a $ 1 00 a month.
I can cIean your house. That'II save you another $ 1 00 a month.
what's going on?
it's Tio Tomas. - What?
he passed. PeacefuIIy.
they took him away.
look. The tangerine tree.
remember how sweet the juice was?
I cried when they had to chop it down.
is that Aunt Lucia there?
Yeah. But who's that woman with her?
I don't know.
he had a Iong, happy Iife, and in the end he didn't suffer.
it's the way he wouId have wanted it.
he didn't want to move from here. -No, he didn't.
look at you. You're showing.
non-penetrative conception is a very unusuaI thing.
I've read about it, but never encountered it...
...and I've been on staff here for eight years.
but in her case, the evidence is there.
there's no reason why the birth shouIdn't be...
...as troubIe-free as a normaI conception.
it may be necessary to physicaIIy break the hymen cIoser to the actuaI deIivery date.
but that shouId be a painIess procedure.
you understand?
it's kind of neat what the guy did...
...but put a hot tub over here and Iandscaping and it'II Iook awesome.
what do we do with this?
this morning, a button came off my suit.
couId you sew it on for me before the funeraI?
are you Iistening to me?
what's wrong with you?
Magdalena was teIIing the truth.
you saw Magdalena?
today at Tomas'.
we went to the cIinic together. The doctor examined her and it's true.
she's never been with a boy.
what?
it's a miracIe.
Tomas AIvarez was a good man.
a man who embodied the Lord's commandments.
especiaIIy the commandment to Iove thy neighbor.
we can be sure that in this moment...
...Tomas has gone to a better pIace.
Amen.
before concIuding our service...
...Carlos, the nephew of Tomas, wouId Iike to say a few words.
Tomas AIvarez was born in JaIisco, Mexico in 1 92 1 .
the 1 3th kid out of 22.
when he was born, he was so smaII...
...the midwife said he wasn't worth washing.
he ended up outIiving aII of them.
in his Iife, he was an office boy.，a barber, and a farm worker.
then in America, he soId champurrado.
everybody knew him.
if you waIk down the street...
...he wouId stop every two minutes to taIk to someone.
they were aIways happy to see him.
he had a Iove inside him that was so strong.
it came from his heart and out through his eyes Iike a goIden Iight.
everybody couId see it...
...because he Ioved everyone and judged no one.
at the end of my Iife, I wiII count it as my greatest priviIege that I knew a saint.
because Tomas AIvarez was a saint.
and he wiII not Ieave us. His spirit is stiII strong.
he'II be with us tiII the end of our days.
your mother teIIs me this is some kind of a miracIe.
there's a scientific expIanation.
the Lord works in mysterious ways.
this wasn't his doing.
everything is his doing.
wiII you forgive me?
of course papa
I'II make it up to you.
I promise.
in memory of Thomas Paterson 1908-1997
and Berlin's pseudo-intellectual, pop culture idiots would watch that shit.
deep down inside, I was very unhappy.
then at this retrospective, they showed "Life Is All You Get" for the millionth time.
I was sitting in the theater and suddenly all I could do was cry.
I realized I was letting life pass me by.
and then I said to myself, Jurgen, "To hell with that cool dude and his tooth gap. You can be more than that! "
Jurgen, you spent the last 8 months in California.
a wonderful country, great people. The glass is always half full.
I took a few classes with a motivation trainer there.
he showed me you can make your dreams come true!
your appearance has changed a bit, too.
Yes. Even if it's hard to believe, I used to have an inferiority complex about my teeth and my looks. I covered it up by telling jokes.
they say you went under the knife of a famous plastic surgeon, any comment?
I had my teeth and my cheek bones done.
hair implants and some silicone work.
silicone?
where?
butt implants! All the stars do it. Check it out.
here, check it out! Here!
they all have them. J-Lo, everybody.
Jurgen, is this all because you'll be turning 40 soon?
I don't have a problem with getting older. I never looked better.
I understand now what life's about. - And that is?
it may sound superficial, but it's true.
for years I preached to my kids about inner values, but it's rubbish!
appearances count. Values catch up. - Last question.
Jurgen, last question.
you had surgery. It's amazing. You look great!
what would you say if your kids suddenly wanted plastic surgery, too?
I mean, you're a role model.
they might try to emulate you.
if it makes them feel better, why not?
it's walls in our heads. That's what I'm talking about.
free yourself from them and you can do anything.
don't let life pass you by. Take control yourself.
you're your own captain on your own big ship of life.
Yeah.
alright, guys. I gotta go!
he used to be so cool.
now he's pumped up with silicone. America really can corrupt you.
but everyone here has silicone boobs, too.
it's fine for boobs, but not Jurgen's ass!
there's good and bad plastic surgery? - Sure!
look out!
look out!
children, ear flaps on!
it's a crosswalk, you giant asshole!
I'd be a blind bat with those on my nose too!
four-eyes!
where were we?
Oh yeah.
boob reductions are pointless operations.
boob augmentations, liposuction, getting rid of cellulite, absolutely necessary.
what about penis extensions?
you have the ability to ruin every serious discussion we have.
pull over. The minister's lover. Right by a baby shop!
shopping with our taxes, Mandy? - I'm just taking a walk.
so that's not actually a pram there? Just an oversized purse on wheels?
it's not mine. I saw it sitting there.
when the baby's here, what then?
will you tell us it's your new, diaper-wearing, bald boyfriend?
Ludo, I've told you before, I'm not pregnant!
Oh, so I must be mistaken then.
maybe you've just gotten fat!
fat? - Sure, I'll just write 'fat.'
Ludo, you know what? You're a real bastard!
minister's LOVER PREGNANT
there you are.
you brought our sweet little Lollo.
he behaves so well in restaurants!
I told you, Lollo.
your uncle was looking forward to seeing you.
since he forgot your birthday. - Oh, shit!
shit! Shit!
shit! Shit!
sweet kid.
weren't you in India at the orphanage?
I was, and I brought back sweet little Shiva here.
is she your latest?
if his mouth is open, he's lying.
and he's useless in bed, too.
wasn't my impression. - All faked.
I'm sorry you slept with my brother.
but I want to order. - Let's get it over with.
Ludo?
how would you like a nice big dish of meat?
lots of different kinds?
just one gets so boring.
just water.
but not a hysterical, reproachful water that's never heard of one-night stands.
a calm, non-stressful one.
I'll have the meat platter.
sounded good.
still no news. If he hasn't called by tonight, I'll forget it.
what about that graphic artist you always call?
no way, It's over, For good, He's such a pervert!
what? Why? - Doesn't matter.
no, tell me. - No, it's yucky.
fine, then don't. - Alright, if you insist.
he said he wanted me to pee the next time we meet.
what? In front of him?
I couldn't do that. - Anna, on him!
you've got a knack for finding weirdoes.
I know.
but I have stories to tell, unlike you.
but I wouldn't constantly order anchovy pizza,
I know it tastes bad.
pizzas don't give you orgasms. - Guys do?
true. - When you eat it, the pizza's gone.
pizza won't say" it's too young for responsibility at 38."
you don't have to say," it was good." - It doesn't look at you saying, "Come! Come! Come!"
quiet up there!
enjoy.
jeez, Ludo.
you can't go on like this forever.
Why?
my job is fun. I've got great friends.
I date pretty women.
and what about love, affection and security?
the warmth of a family?
seeing your sleeping child and feeling your heart burst with joy.
you're missing the best things in life.
Lollo, come here now!
moritz? Okay, I'm coming. Gotta run.
klitschko is proposing to Yvonne Catterfeld.
that soccer player? - Precisely.
it never happened before and never will.
it's all cordoned off. We can forget it.
go cry with the other girls. I'm getting my shot!
you're so cruel.
being realistic doesn't make me a pansy.
Andreas.
you okay? - Ludo!
we need seats in the restaurant. - Not today.
what are you smiling at? Lucky I don't smack you one.
What're we going to do?
has your boss seen the photos of your party in the President Suite?
what party?
remember? The cute mustached guys.
in police uniforms. Were they real?
how about free passes to our wellness area?
the sundeck has a fantastic view of the city lights.
do we look like frustrated wives?
and of the gorgeous, see-through glass dome over our restaurant.
what will it be? A massage?
a Cleopatra bath? A facial?
we have 10 minutes. What's quick?
wellness means relaxation and not... - Fine. I'll take the massage.
excellent. Danielle?
Yes.
hello. - Hello.
may I take you to my room? You may undress there.
glad to.
would you give me the Cleopatra bath?
of course I will.
me and a few slutty maids looking for an extra buck.
it's our special service for perverts who think this is a cheap brothel.
okay, sorry. It doesn't hurt to ask.
so what's the quickest? - Thorsten!
one full body depilation!
Depilation? Doesn't that hurt?
it depends. - On what?
if you have hair or not.
what's that weird squeaking?
it's the sound of dolphins in the ocean.
it's very relaxing.
sure having fun, those dolphins.
dolphins are very social.
almost human. - Ludo, I'm coming!
I think one of them is called Ludo.
Ludo! Ludo!
dear friends, my dear Yvonne...
an old Russian proverb says:
even if women were made of glass, you couldn't see through them.
that way. Go.
and my personal opinion on that: Proverbs are often complete nonsense!
come on! - What is this shit?
when I first saw you at the Golden Camera, standing there...
Ouch! - Come on!
looking at me with those blue eyes. - I remember, my buttercup...
it's the perfect shot!
this wax is stuck to the railing. - Then rip it off.
the hell I will. Do you know how much that'll hurt?
at that moment I knew...
...that I had fallen in love with you, with your beauty.
come and take the damn picture!
your soul.
your heart.
Ludo, it's glass! It'll break!
your gracefulness. - "It'll break!"
panda bear, that's lovely, but "brevity is the soul of wit."
watch!
get to the point.
is that cracking?
we're hungry.
Yvonne, I love you. - It's bullet-proof.
and I want to ask you here and now...
did you invite him? - No, but since he dropped in...
little man...
I don't remember inviting you.
resume the Ludo Decker hearing.
let's move to the sentencing.
why is she giving me that evil look?
actually, she's looking at me. She's cross-eyed.
how do you know that?
she's my ex-wife.
your ex-wife? Shit! Then she's biased.
No! We separated on good terms.
Really? Look at her expression. - I know.
she looked like that at our wedding. Believe me, it doesn't mean a thing.
have the gentlemen finished? Then I may proceed.
the court regards the defendant's claim to have gotten lost on the hotel roof a feeble attempt at self-protection.
the court holds the defendant's behavior to be highly immature.
the court moves to forego the fine requested by the prosecutor.
bingo, I said so!
the defendant should be allowed to work on his poor social skills.
I sentence him to 8 months of jail.
I'm going to jail! - Wait!
Erika! Come on!
sit your ass down!
the sentence will be suspended.
terms will be 300 hours' community service.
in a city day-care center. - She can't!
she can!
if the defendant violates probation, the prison sentence will be enforced.
daily CHECKMATED Hot off the press this morning, for gentlemen with kind regards.
he screwed you two! When I say screwed, I mean it.
and that Jurgen Vogel screwed you two idiots good and proper.
he's laughing at us!
including me!
do you know what I can't stand? Do you know?
when someone makes fun of us. - You deserve a diploma!
things like that happen.
remember Hitler's diary?
so? And did we print it?
no. - Now here's something funny.
your naked ass on Klitschko's wedding ring. Hilarious, ain't it?
let's get it on YouTube, eBay!
and to change the subject, how did it go in court?
they hit me with 300 hours' community service.
300 hours for that nonsense? Was she mad?
what?
you'll have to cut back a little on your free-time.
cut back. Cut back on fuck-bunnies. Good one!
and now get out! Okay? But instead of Stefan and Lukas, you two get me pictures of those folk music morons! Got it? Go!
Michi Nussbaumer and Daniela Berg.
you have decided to tie the knot after 9 long years.
Michi, why did you wait so long?
well, I asked my sweet pea before, but she didn't want me.
when we were on Karl Moik's show,
Michi came to me and said "We'd make a super team" .
whaddya say?
why did you say no, Dani?
we were only 12.
it was our first TV performance.
Michi, there have been strange rumors of you wanting to separate.
and others about an affair. Any comment?
they're nonsense.
wouldn't you like to try the meat?
the world isn't always rosy in our business.
and yet our job is the best in the world!
we don't just sing 'Baby, yeah, yeah' all the time.
our music comes from the heart.
Andi had a problem with Dani and me. - What are you talking about?
tell 'em! - What?
well?
shall we take the photo in front of the wedding cabinet?
fine. - May we go to the toilet?
we need to go to the toilet. - I'm eating.
I'll keep an eye on that.
up the staircase and straight ahead.
you want me to hide in the cabinet?
just until something happens. Then snap and go.
shall I just stroll out, "Hi! Could I have another sausage?"
think of something. - Then you sit here!
are you nuts? I have to get to that day-care.
and what if they don't fight? Things looked very sweet just now.
I think the sausage has gone to your head. I'm relying on you. Okay?
I can say what I want, stupid cow! - So the tabloids can write - you're screwing that slut , Manuela can't even spell" slut."
because she's so stupid!
I hate this stupid Bavarian crap!
this saccharin bullshit!
then go back to your home town and your job at the meat counter.
pulling Andi into this was low! - He told everyone.
Andi Borg knows. Karl Moik knows. Florian Silbereisen knows.
if he knows, then Carmen does.
who's fault is it? Whose hormones are out of control?
at least I have some. - I hate you!
Hey!
Hey! Are you crazy?
grandpa's favorite bell. It's broken!
Michi, I didn't mean it like that.
Hello, I'm... - Ludo Decker. I don't believe it.
have we met? - Yes. I'm Anna Gotzlowski.
doesn't ring a bell. - No?
think hard.
isn't it sometimes nicer not to call and keep the memory of it?
what are you on about? - I was probably drunk.
are they from our garden?
did you rip them out? - No.
they're for you.
so what do you want? - I'm here for my community service.
that's you?
come in.
nice glasses. - Bootlicker.
could I use the toilet?
right here. - Thanks.
and aim for Snow White!
what are you doing here? - I have to pee.
with a phone?
no. 1 or No. 2?
who's asking? - I am.
that way.
and aim for Snow White!
come on, think hard. Anna Gotzlowski. Gotzlowski. With a 'G '
and she's butt-ugly? - Nerdy glasses and a cat jersey.
you'd never talk to someone like her. - I just don't know.
what about that children's benefit gala?
you left with the 'Leute' presenter. - The film prize?
the twin hostesses. - And the Aids gala?
the Asian weightlifter. I wanted her.
no private calls! Time for work! Got it? Hang up! Thanks.
remember the meeting with the boss. - No can do. I can't leave.
the hell I will! His blood pressure is already 580!
don't cry. I'll be there ASAP.
I have to brown nose for a while.
a brown horse? - Nose!
what do you mean 'hose'
good grief!
do you remember now?
I can give you a hint:
playing field.
soccer.
Hey, four-eyes!
here it comes.
very funny, Ludo.
laugh it up!
you were Susi's or Bine's friend? - Nope.
but we had a load of fun together.
or you had your fun with me.
you played that funny game with me.
3, 2, 1. - What was it called?
fire! - Magnet bingo?
Yeah! Magnet bingo! Now I remember.
small world! You're little Anna. You always tattled on me to my sister.
stupid idiot! I'm telling your sister!
and I thought we had had sex. - I was eight!
we're only good, old friends. Super!
we're not friends. - Come on. I used to give you Cokes.
your parents wouldn't let you drink that American crap.
Hey, four-eyes! Nice glasses.
Thanks.
want a tasty Coke? - Coke is very yummy.
catch!
Thanks.
you asshole! - That was funny!
you'll have your fun soon enough. Promise.
then he'll have to wait!
ask him about his stupid vacation home on Sylt. That'll calm him down again.
turn it off. - I'm working.
right. We need a new jungle gym. - I'm a journalist, not a handyman.
I'll put it together, you can help Cheyenne-Blue in the john.
she has trouble with Snow White. - I'll build it. Where is it?
you're sitting on it.
here are the instructions. It should be easy.
just follow the arrows.
unfortunately it's all in Dutch.
are you sure it's not for a jet engine?
listen up, jerk. If you refuse, one call to your probation officer and you land in jail.
thank you.
same to you, stupid cow.
you say pretty funny things.
Really? Then you're the only girl here who thinks so.
maybe we should've given him the German instructions.
you can't be serious! I told you everything he did to me.
but he is kinda sexy. Don't you think?
what's sexy about him? - His butt, for example. Pretty hot.
you're drooling. He's only a stupid underwear model.
Hello?
no way! I don't believe it!
Lena-Chantal, that's why you have to pick your things!
you clean up your crap!
you clean up after yourself!
no phone calls here!
give it to me now! - You're kidding.
give me your telephone! - No way!
okay, friend... - I thought we weren't friends.
don't you have a job?
something to do with a jungle gym? - I'm done.
no way. Where? - Where you wanted it.
I want to see it.
what the hell is this? - A pretty wild jungle gym set.
no, it's not. It's a disease. - I didn't have much time.
hold on, any half-witted chimp could put it together in 30 minutes.
if he knew Dutch, sure.
amazing how guys like you always have an excuse for your own incompetence.
women know everything but can't put together IKEA shelves.
I've put together thousands! - At the IKEA world championships?
stupid ass ass!
pecker!
now you've wrecked it.
you really try your hardest. I said no phone calls!
it's a text message. I'm allowed to read a message!
no text messaging either!
that didn't hurt.
nice of you to visit.
we actually wanted to ask you about day-care.
no way! He's a trouble maker!
only when I'm provoked. - Don't say that about him!
it's not his fault.
it's a bad idea. If something goes wrong, the ogre sends me to jail.
what could happen? - He's been thrown out of 10 day-cares!
8. - 12.
and he bit off his au-pair's ear. - She provoked me.
the doctor said in a few years her natural skin color will come back.
it'd be my death. So, nice seeing you.
What'd be your death?
Hello, Anna!
remember me? Lilli, Ludo's sister.
you always tattled to me.
I didn't tattle. - Yes, you did.
what's the problem here?
Ludo won't let Lollo join the day-care group.
Ludo has no say here.
welcome to our day-care center. - Really?
Thanks. I promise he won't cause trouble.
and if he does?
then it's your fault. Easy.
"was the happiness of the Bavarian beauty and the tawdry trumpeter just a big lie?"" Were things over years ago when Michi started flirting with the meat counter girl Manuela S?"
I'd love to know who cares.
I'd say about 12 million readers.
stop gabbing, Set up the chairs.
what's happening? - Did I say ask questions?
Bello Bear's Magic Show. - Bello, who?
you don't know?
an ex music teacher who writes great children's songs.
a grown-up who calls himself Bello Bear?
of course he thinks it's uncool. - The kids think he's cool.
kids think sticking a pea in your nose is cool.
at least some guys don't only think about their abs.
when you're done with the chairs, then you can set up Bello's stage.
I thought the jerk could do magic.
good morning. Let's be a bird. - Eagle!
a big bird with long wings.
an eagle. A golden eagle.
now let's be coral in the sea, swaying back and forth in the sea. - Alright!
next time aim for Snow White! That's why Anna painted it there.
what's so difficult about pooping straight down!
and you get these back when you act nice again.
you said they were a present.
do you want your uncle to get upset?
good morning, sun!
good morning, grass!
good morning, trees!
Hey, Madonna! Someone wants to join in here.
always making fun of everything. - They'll get in the Waldorf school.
good morning, globalization opponents! Good morning, world peace!
good morning, armpit hair!
good morning, Ludo!
good morning, Ludo!
that'll get 'em in the Rutli school. - Bello's assistant is sick.
who cares?
there are lots of kids here! Shall we all call for Mucky?
Yes!
mucky!
there's Mucky!
so, who are you?
what kind of a funny boy are you?
I'm Mucky from the Magic Forest. - I know, tell the kids!
I'm Mucky from the Magic Forest!
Yes, Mucky from the Me-My-Magic Forest.
can you say it louder and funnier?
I'm Mucky from the Magic Forest!
get on with it, jerk! - It's my show, buddy!
let's sing a magic bear song and everyone can dance along.
I'm Bi-Ba-Bello. I come from afar and all the key-kay-kids call me the magic bear.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. I'm the magic bear.
alright, my dear Mucky!
now it's time for some magic!
Abracadabra!
no good?
you are really spoiled.
then silly-billy Mucky will have to help me.
get your paws off me, jerk!
idiot! - Get lost, asshole!
do you know how to tie shoes?
of course. Come here.
have a seat.
fine.
these don't have laces.
but they sure are pretty shoes. New?
no, I've had them for 5 years. - 5 years! You were born with them?
you're funny.
say, what's your name?
Cheyenne-Blue.
Cheyenne-Blue? That's a unique name.
my mom's an actress.
actresses aren't allowed to give their kids normal names.
I see. And is your dad an actor?
no, he's an asshole!
and your mom's through with men?
my mom says she can never get enough men.
she's got lots of new ones now. Hundreds, even thousands.
and where from? - From the theater.
where she works. She chooses one and brings him home.
your mom sounds real nice.
but they don't get breakfast. Only I do.
that sounds good.
hello.
mommy!
Hey, there.
Hi, I'm Nina, Cheyenne-Blue's mom. - Hi, I'm Ludo.
I've heard a lot about you.
my daughter has a crush on you.
I can understand why.
how nice that mom and daughter agree.
and someone as cute as you can be crazy about kids?
I believe that society is only worth as much as the love and affection it shows to its smallest members.
you know, I don't usually do something like this, but I'd love to have you over when the little one's asleep.
glad to.
Where'd you dig up this little treasure?
easy. From his probation officer. Otherwise he'd have landed in jail.
Really? In jail?
what? - Bye.
Ouch! Are you crazy?
what was that? - This is not a pick-up joint!
I am working hard here! - We're a day-care, not a brothel!
lighten up, baby!
say that again and I'll tell on you. - Go ahead. Just like the old days.
I've had it. I'm calling your probation officer.
let's see how funny jail is.
go ahead. Say hi for me, too.
I am relaxed! If I want to, I can really let myself go!
I'm an animal in bed!
and another thing: You gave the kids darts. Great!
have you lost your mind? Do you know what could happen?
jeez, they're kids not complete idiots!
Anna.
if the police don't revoke your license, I will.
you can't lose what you don't have. - What?
watch out, four-eyes! - Four-eyes?
I don't even need them to watch TV.
great! It was new.
don't you have any other problems?
stop! Stop!
to the hospital. Fast!
shit! I'm out of cash.
what's he doing? Keep driving!
money doesn't grow on trees. - Hey, we've got an injured child.
do I look like a charity?
it's an emergency, you bastard! - Hey, calm down.
here's a 20.
now get driving, jerk! - Stay calm.
uncle Ludo.
I can't see anything.
it hurts so much.
nonsense. It's just a little mosquito bite.
just a mosquito bite.
what are you doing? Keep driving! - End of the road.
if you have another bill, I'll keep going.
asshole!
you always meet again. Wait and see. - Ludo, let's go.
fag!
we need a doctor!
and I need the health card and your son's name.
can't you see the dart in his head?
his name! - Who the hell cares!
not in that tone.
can you pay the processing fee?
get your fat ass moving and find a doctor!
or I'll sue you all after I smack you in the mouth!
the dart is lodged in the skull, but hasn't penetrated the bone.
the skull lining is intact.
now I'll pull out the dart.
it'll hurt a little, but Indians are brave.
it'll just sting a little.
just don't look at it.
look at me.
Lollo! Look me in the eye. Tell me, what's that bunny you like called?
Felix. - Felix, right.
and what does he have on his back? - A backpack.
exactly.
that was it.
we'll clean it up a bit, and then give you a tetanus shot.
what?
mom!
I didn't even cry. - Great!
a real champion.
that's real important when you have a rusty dart in your head.
why not leave them in the sandbox next time? Raises your chances.
if you keep your eye on the kids as you did today, you'll really help!
then lock me in the bathroom.
with your head down the toilet! - Asshole!
nice to meet you. - Stop it!
it's okay. We're here almost weekly.
we both messed up. - No, you did!
you mess everything up. You left them in the garden.
and so it's all your fault that your nephew nearly bled to death!
what are you gaping at? No forms to fill out?
get undressed. - Everything?
didn't you want to blow in the orchestra?
okay. - Alright then.
get undressed. - What instrument should I blow?
you'll see soon enough.
it will be a very big one.
pervert! - It's me.
Hi. I just wanted to say I didn't call your probation officer.
Yeah. - Because I want to stop tattling.
and because I might have been a little tough on you.
is this an apology? - In a manner of speaking.
a manner of speaking?
dear Ludo... - So it's not an apology?
I may have emotionally overreacted now and then.
I wasn't always fair... - Are you reading this?
nonsense.
you did great with Lollo today.
this shone a light on certain qualities you possess.
we should've paid better attention. - Hey, you are reading it!
furthermore I'm sorry for giving you the complicated Dutch instructions.
I shall submit the German ones to you immediately.
did you type it or write it by hand? - Don't keep interrupting.
does this make everything alright again?
is everything alright, you jerk?
whose baton is the biggest? - Yours!
who's shouting?
I'm watching a Jackie Chan film. - Oh.
there, it's over. - So what're you...
What're you doing tomorrow? - Nothing, why?
maybe we could have fish and chips. - Fish and chips?
I love fish.
you love fish?
Hello?
I opened his present. A trip to a 5-star wellness hotel on Mallorca.
I figure I'm with the best guy in the world.
he drives me to the airport. Kisses me. Separation anxiety.
how will I manage without you?
I jokingly say, "It was your idea, honey.
I'm at the airport. My flight gets cancelled.
I take a taxi home. Open the door and walk in.
he's screwing my best friend. On my blankie.
I couldn't believe it. - That's tough.
it gets worse. They had one of his pornos on!
I never understood how anyone can watch that stuff.
I put up with it because I loved him. But he fucks her on my blankie.
and then? - Then I threw him out.
we talked it over, nearly made up, I forgave him...
and then he went to her and the baby.
I did everything for him. I made a fool of myself.
and he was just a jerk.
no relationship can work if you're being made a fool of.
either the one on top dumps the fool, because he's bored and lost respect.
or the fool realizes that he's a fool, that he's selling himself short and has nothing left, and he goes.
look at it like this, you learnt something:
men are jerks and make you unhappy.
no man in the world can make you happy, if you weren't happy already.
you have to make yourself happy.
it's totally selfish to wait at home, frustrated, expecting someone else to make you happy all the time.
and anyway it's normal to be unhappy.
I don't run around every day saying, "Life is awesome"!
why does everyone expect to be happy all the time?
sounds nice, but what do you know about relationships?
you only want sex.
think I've never had a relationship? That's why I'm alone!
it's so difficult to find someone who's got it together and doesn't expect me to make them happy.
and blame me for it when they're not.
so when's your book coming out? - What book?
Ludo Decker, Pour Some Sunshine in Your Life,
together Alone.
is it in the library?
it's on eBay.
you can't accept responsibility. You only want sex.
why not? It's fun.
what about the girls you sleep with? Are they having fun, too?
I really think so.
they should be grateful they can sit at home and be love-sick?
you think they're in love with me? - Happens to women sometimes.
not mine. My women know what they're getting into.
the boundaries are discussed from the start.
Ludo, you can discuss all you want, but things change.
maybe I sleep with a guy and nothing happens. A one-night stand. Great!
if it was good, I keep going back...
at some point I think, maybe he's got more to him.
by the fifth time women are in love.
Really?
no matter what you've discussed, it's still no free ticket to act like an ass and shirk any responsibility.
responsibility? I only have it if I'm together with someone.
if I say from the start, " Let's have fun, but I don't want a relationship.
then I'm not an ass. If you don't get it, tough.
then no more sex for you. - Why not?
you don't get it! They're just acting. That's the joke.
listen. You say: I just want some fun.
she says: Let's just have some fun, but thinks: Those were duds before me.
he doesn't know I'm the best thing he's ever had. Wait till he finds out!
you stick to the original agreement, she's been going down another street and in the end you're the ass.
so either I have sex and I am an ass, or I'm not an ass and I don't have sex, right?
Yes.
then I'd rather be an ass.
I thought so.
let's be serious. That woman has no clue.
that's why she's working at a day-care center.
my dad's a renter. - Center.
no, a renter!
I'm proof she doesn't know what she's talking about.
I'm a woman.
right?
I'm telling you, some women only want sex.
maybe they're pretending. - The hell they are!
Ludo, relax. - Don't ruin things.
you're too tense.
I'm a woman and I only want sex.
dirty, quick, hard.
and the best thing is: No ties.
and on top of it:
I turn into a pizza afterward.
holy cow.
what's up?
Ken? How are you? This is Charlie Babbitt.
we're definitely locked in this box with no TV.
I just heard about this $10, 000 charge for every car.
they're definitely gonna start. - How can this be?

they start on the button. They definitely start on the button.
I've got a problem. I'll call you from my next stop.
we're not gonna make it to the program.

eight minutes to Wapner. - We got eight minutes to Wapner.

four minutes to Wapner. - Just shut up and stand there.
Yeah. Uh... - Don't rock and moan.
put your hands down.
good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald Clemons from the A. C. Nielsen Company.
you're familiar with our work? - You mean the TV ratings?
Yes, ma'am. You've been selected as a preliminary candidate to become our next Nielsen family in the tri-county area.

in return for which you'll receive a check in the amount of $286 each month.
who's he?
that would be my partner, Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample
that's it. - Oh, boy.
you'll miss your program.
it's finished. - One minute to Wapner.
one minute to Wapner.
I had you in there, Ray!
Defendants! Plaintiffs! You had it all!
they're in there making legal history, Ray.
legal history. - Oh, boy!
Oh, boy. - What is going on out here?
I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you. That man is my brother.
if he doesn't watch 'People's Court' in about 30 seconds...
he'll have a fit on your porch.
now, you can help me, or you can stand there and watch it happen.
we Like to watch cartoons. You think he'd settle for that?
...and she sees an identical twin.
true, he didn't have his shirt on，the other one did
but they sure look alike to me.
if it got on his chest, even if it didn't burn or got real cold
I put my hand on the dry ice. - Daddy's not here now.
I wanted to take it off quickly because it got very cold.
I also confess, I was afraid I might burn my hand.
if I put it up against a bare chest
Ken, work with me. I'll take care of you
you know that song? - My judgment is for the defendant.
we'll be back for the reaction to Judge Wapner's decision right after these messages.
my credit card's been rejected? - Yes, sir.
must be some accounting error. How much will this cost?
twenty dollars, sir.
thank you.
I'm never going back. It's gonna be a Long time.
definitely gonna be a Long journey. - Just a couple of more days.
you know the fella's name? Then who's playing first?
the fella playing first for St. Louie? - You gonna start with this again?
it's just another motel. You gotta do this every time?
that's the man's name. That's whose name.
what are you asking me for? I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
who is on first. I'm asking you, who's on first?
yo, Ray. - That's the man's name.
this is not a riddle. - Yeah. Know the fella's name?
Yeah. Then who's playing first base? -You'll never figure out who's on first.
who is on first. That's the joke. It's comedy.
sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.
whose wife? - It's comedy.
every dollar of it. Yeah.
you got a first baseman on first? Yeah.
it's a routine between Abbott and Costello.
when you do it, you're not funny. You're Abbott and Abbott.
Yeah. - You understand me?
sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.
whose wife? Yeah.
ray? - Yeah.
you are never gonna solve it. - Yeah.
you know why? It's not a riddle. And if you understood that...
if you understood that it's funny, you might get better.
all I'm trying to find out is what's the guy's name on first base.
what's the guy's name on first base? No, what's the guy's name on second base.
have you got a first baseman on first? Yeah.

one run is in. Here's Brenly going to third.
the throw by Davis not in time.
Brenly in safely at third base...
on Maldonado's single.
he held that ball too Long in center field, don't you think so?
we'll look at it again.
Treadwell playing way over towards the right side, shaded him to pull.
here's Davis.
Yeah, he seems to hold it there just a bit, Tom.
sort of double-pumped it. Watch the replay.
he loses all chance on a play on Brenly...
even though Brenly doesn't exactly run fast.
and the throw into third base finally is a little bit high.
will you give me a break with this?
ray, stop it.

Yeah, dancin'. - You wanna close your hand here.

I'm glad to see you.

it's not right, what you're doing to Raymond.
he's fine. - I know he's fine.
he's in Las Vegas in a suit in a big room. It makes me sad.
six minutes to my date.
six minutes to Iris.
he has a date?
Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't carry that television everywhere we go.
why do you have to bring a Watchman on your date?
a man's dancing.
but what does your date look Like, Raymond?
she's very sparkly. She looks Like a holiday.
I haven't heard that one before. - Mr. Babbitt?
Mr. Kelso would Like to see you. - I don't know Mr. Kelso.
he's director of security. Would you come with me, please?
sure. Susanna, you stay with Raymond.
right this way. - Certainly.
10: 01, she's not here.
she'll come. She will.
congratulations, Mr. Babbitt. Counting into a six-deck shoe is a feat.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
we make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt, and we analyze the tapes...
and we even share some of the information with the other casinos.
these tapes suggest that you should take your winnings and Leave the state.
someone has a good day at the tables...
and you accuse them of illegal activities?
is this how you treat all your guests?
all you have to do is close your mouth and go home.
those are the best odds you're gonna see for a while. I'd take 'em.
did you want to dance on your date? - Yeah.
there'll be other chances. Many pretty girls would love to dance with you.
Yeah. - It's gonna be okay.
I Like this music, Ray. - Elevator stopped.
it's okay. You think you could show me how you were going to dance with Iris?
Yeah. - Yes?
would you Like to dance with me? - Elevator's on hold.
give me this. - Yeah.
Yeah. - Show me how.
Charlie Babbitt taught me.
Charlie Babbitt? - Yeah.
dancing in the elevator.
it's nice.
you're very good.
iris missed a beautiful dance. - Yeah.
and a kiss. - Yeah, a kiss.
have you ever kissed a girl? - I don't know.
you don't know?
open your mouth. Open.
Yeah. - Like this.
like you were tasting something very good and very soft.
like this. Close your eyes.
it's okay, Ray. - Yeah.
how was that? - Wet.
then we did it right. - Elevator's definitely stuck.
no, it's not stuck.
here.
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.
like us. - Yeah, Like us.
What'd I tell you, Ray? I promised you could drive.
at Wallbrook, I drive on the driveway. - Charlie, this is okay?
I'm an excellent driver. - He's good on a driveway.
ray, why don't you get in the front seat?
so, I'll wait to hear from you after Raymond's meeting?
Yeah. - It's gonna be fine.
Yeah. I'm nervous. - I know.
listen, I'm glad, happy... I'm happy that you came to Vegas.
I know.
ray, thank you for the date in the elevator. It was really nice.
Yeah.
thank you for the what? - It's something between us.
between us? - Us.
us, Ray?
here we go, Ray. This is your bedroom up here.
of course, there's definitely no bed there.
no, this is a magic bed, Ray. You just watch and see.
we got the table over here. We got the television, Ray.
went to the video store. Got a surprise for you, Ray.
picked up a video for you.
don't start with that, Ray.
it's not just another place, Ray. This is my place.
I'm asking you who's on first. That's the man's name.
who? The first baseman. Who is on first.
you got a first baseman on first? Certainly. Then who's playing first?
the man's entitled to it. - Who is?
Yes.
so who gets it? - Why shouldn't he?
sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.
whose wife? - Yes.
after all, the man earns it. - Who does?
Absolutely.
all I'm tryin' to find out is what's the guy's name on first base?
no, What is on second base.
don't you think this is funny? - Yes, it's funny.
Where'd you see this first? - Dad gave me a book on baseball trivia.
dad, huh? - Yeah.
guess it didn't read as funny. - Definitely not.
Hello, this is Dr. Bruner. I'd Like you to call me.
Yeah, what is it?
I thought I got the machine.
I just got into town, and the psychological interview is tomorrow.
Yes, sir, I know that.
I thought we should get together and talk.
I think it might be in your best interests to meet me.
when?
I'm at the Bonaventure. How about tonight at 8: 30?
tomorrow you'll meet Dr. Marston, who's in charge of Raymond's evaluation.
Yeah, I know. - I gave him boxes of files on Raymond.
good luck. - This isn't a close call.
it's a formality. Your brother's a very disabled individual.
are you trying to tell me that Marston's gonna rule against me?
no, I'm telling you it's always been a lost cause.
then why did you call me? - Let me tell you something.
your father put me in charge of all the money.
it doesn't matter whether or not you win custody of Raymond.
I won't have to pay you a dime. It's at my discretion.
so you can't lose? - I can lose Raymond.
I care about your brother's Life and the treatment he receives.
I made a commitment to your father some 20 years ago...
and I'm not willing to gamble with that.
what is this?
it's a very big check.
250000
and no strings attached. Just walk away, Charlie.
this isn't about you and me.
it's not about winning or losing.
I asked you a week ago, why didn't anyone ever tell me I had a brother?
you didn't have an answer.
I don't know.
I just realized I'm not pissed off anymore...
my father cut me out of his will.
you probably knew he tried to contact me over the years.
I never called him back. I was a prick.
if he was my son and didn't return my calls, I'd have written him out.
but it's not about the money anymore.
you know, I just don't understand.
why didn't he tell me I had a brother?
why didn't anyone ever tell me that I had a brother?
because it'd have been nice to know him for more than just the past six days.
ray! Come on.
it stopped. It's all right.
Vern. Vern.
my main man, Vern.
Vern.
my main man, Vern.
V-E-R-N. Vern, my main man.
they got raspberry, blueberry...
whole wheat, peachy keen, beer nut, rocky road, buckwheat.
how about buckwheat? What kind of pancakes you want, Ray?
pancakes. - What kind?
pancakes. - Of course.
the maple syrup is supposed to be on the table before the pan
Charlie Babbitt made a joke.
I made a joke, Ray. - Yeah.
step back a little bit.
Hello?
why don't you go sit down over there?
Hello?
this is not a legal proceeding, so there's no judge present...
just the people who care about Raymond.
Raymond, have a seat over there. Mr. Babbitt, other side of the table.
Raymond, right here. How about this seat?
take this seat. - Put your knapsack on the floor.
this is a good opportunity to be honest with one another.
ray, the TV? On the floor. I'm sorry.
I don't know an easy way to say this, Mr. Babbitt
have I lost already?
no, you haven't lost. I'm not the judge and jury.
I'm just making a recommendation to a court.
I must tell you that Dr. Bruner is a very respected professional.
Raymond's case has been meticulously documented over the years...
and Wallbrook is one of the finest institutions in this country.
you've made up your mind. I'll see you in court.
my brother came further with me than he did with you in 20 years.
it's not necessary to...- You don't know anything about us.
it's not necessary to challenge him. - I'm sorry.
exactly what happened this past week, Raymond?
we got to know each other. - I was asking Raymond.
Raymond, what happened this past week?
what did you do? - Counted cards.
counted cards? - Counted cards in Las Vegas.
your brother took you to Las Vegas? - Lost $3, 000 on the wheel of fortune.
gave you $3, 000 to gamble with?
lost $3, 000 on pitiful 20.
and what else did you do? - Bet on number 20.
what else did you do? - Danced with Charlie Babbitt.
danced with your brother? - He wanted to learn.
danced in the elevator with Susanna. Kissed Susanna.
you kissed Susanna? - Yeah, in the elevator.
did you enjoy kissing a woman? - I don't know.
how did it feel? - It felt wet.
wet? - Yeah.
quite a trip, huh? - Yeah.
did you enjoy being on the road? - I'm an excellent driver.
you drove? - Yeah.
your brother let you drive the highway? -Slow on the driveway.
he didn't drive on the highway.
did he have any emotional outbursts? - What do you mean?
well, things they tend to do when... Inflict bodily harm on themselves.
Yeah, a couple of times. - A couple of times?
he had what you call an outburst at the airport because he didn't wanna fly.
so we didn't fly. - When was his last outburst?
this morning when... - This morning?
this is bullshit, because I could tell you anything or tell you nothing.
you'd never know the difference. This morning the smoke alarm went off.
he got nervous, but he's fine now.
don't feel as I'm placing any blame.
we went out for pancakes. He's fine.
you don't have to be defensive. - I'm just being honest with you.
you're missing the point. - I'm being truthful about this.
I'm not placing any blame
I had a father I hardly knew, a mother I didn't know at all.
I find out now that I have a brother, and I'm supposed to give him up?
no one is saying anything.
I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me, we're not hurting you.
why are you interfering? - I'm not interfering.
this is my family. - I understand that.
your brother is not capable of having a relationship with you.
that's your opinion. Did you spend 24 hours a day, seven days a week with him?
you cannot care for your brother without professional guidance.
that's your opinion. - Yes, it's my opinion.
there's some things I'd Like to go over.
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you stole Raymond out of the institution...
and were willing to trade him for $1. 5 million, correct?
my father died. I was upset.
that was wrong.
last week you were upset, and this week you've found a devotion to him and you want to take care of him.
Yes.
from the beginning it was Like a kidnapping.
kidnapping. That's very strong. I didn't kidnap my brother.
but in the course of a week, you came to have an understanding with him.
Yes.
look, that。 - Yes?
I understand that this sounds irrational to you.
when it started out
don't feel compelled to be defensive. - Can I talk?
Yes, you can. - Thank you.
there's no accusations. Go ahead.
no accusations?
see, you have to understand...
that when we started out together that he was only my brother...
in name.
and then...
this morning we had pancakes.
maple syrup. Maple syrup on the...
maple syrup on the table.
and Charlie Babbitt made a joke.
see, we
I made a connection.
I think it's admirable that you made a connection...
but the purpose of this meeting is to determine what is best for Raymond...
whether or not he's capable of functioning in the community...
and what, in fact, he wants, if that's possible to determine.
I'm all for that.
Raymond's unable to make decisions. - You're wrong.
he can't decide for himself.
he's capable of a lot more than you know.
why don't we ask Raymond?
Raymond, can I ask you a few questions?
the doctor's talking to you. - Can I ask you a few questions?
do you wanna stay with your brother?
Raymond, would you Like to stay with your brother in Los Angeles?
the doctor's asking you a question.
so you listen. - Yeah.
Raymond, do you wanna stay with your brother Charlie?
do you wanna stay with your brother? - Yeah.
you do? - Yeah.
you wanna stay with your brother?
Yeah. I wanna stay with my brother Charlie Babbitt.
that's what you want? - Yeah.
you wanna stay with your brother? - Yeah.
can I ask you something else? - Yeah.
you wanna go back to Wallbrook? - Yeah.
Raymond, can you make a distinction between your brother and Wallbrook?
Yeah.
do you wanna stay with your brother? - Yeah.
or do you wanna go to Wallbrook? - Yeah.
they're two separate things.
your brother or Wallbrook? It's not one thing, Raymond.
back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie. - Okay.
back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie. - Can you make that choice?
one or the other. - Go back to Wallbrook.
all right.
just hold on here.
all right.
all right. You made your point.
you don't have to humiliate him. Ray, it's okay.
it's over. - Yeah.
stay back at Wallbrook with Charlie Babbitt.
stay back at Wallbrook-- - It's over.
Raymond? - Yeah.
Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you?
excuse me.
you okay, Ray? - Yeah.
you don't want more questions, do you? - No.
I don't know.
you don't want more questions, do you? - No.
there won't be any more questions. - Yeah.
I'll make sure of that. - Yeah, main man.
what? - My main man.
listen.
ray, I don't know if I'm gonna have a chance to talk to you again.
because you see, these...
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot, and he's probably gonna take you back.
you know? - Yeah.
what I said about being on the road with you I meant.
connecting.
I Like having you for my brother. - I'm an excellent driver.
Yes, you are.
I Like having you for my big brother.
main man.
may I have your attention, please?
Amtrak train number 36, the Desert Wind, eastbound...
now boarding, track number three.
fullerton, San Bernardino, Barstow... - Ray.
Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Denver, Omaha, Chicago.
Hello, Charlie. - Dr. Bruner.
Hello, Raymond.
wouldn't you feel more relaxed in your favorite Kmart clothes?
tell him, Ray.
kmart sucks. - I see.
I have the tickets, and I'll be on this car right here to the right.
why don't you take a couple of minutes? See you, Charlie.
you made a joke, Ray.
I guess I'd better give this to you. You're gonna have to carry this now.
it's got your cheeseballs, your apple juice...
notebooks, pens and...
"who's On First?' video that you Like.
"who's On First？"is very funny. - I told you it's funny.
board!
better get goin'. - Very shiny train.
Yeah, it sure is.
now listen, Ray. Dr. Bruner only has custody of you.
that doesn't mean I can't visit.
I'm comin' to see you in two weeks.
how many days is that? - Fourteen days from today.
today's Wednesday. - And hours?
336 hours.
mortifying.
course, that's 20, 160 minutes.
1, 209, 600 seconds.
ray?
I'll see you soon.
Yeah. One for bad, two for good.
bet two for good.
three minutes to Wapner.
you'll make it.
Yeah.
fish and reptiles are born ready to survive on their own. Mice are ready in days.
granted, mice only live for a few months, so for mouse parents, a day probably seems like an eternity.
anyway, my point is, scientists say our childhoods are longer 'cause we need to learn more to survive.
I think it's 'cause we're the only animal that's aware of its own limitations, chiefly among those being, of course, death.
and in return, we get bonus innocence time.
when you're a child, you believe everything is possible because, in a sense, it is.
when you're 10, everybody actually has a shot at being bill gates.
well, not--not everybody.
when you're a kid, you believe you're an invincible, all-powerful being and the world that revolves around you has an absolute order, where good always triumphs over evil and everything makes sense.
unless your father was a cop killed in a shoot-out with a drug dealer.
my mom cries sometimes.
she goes in her room, but I can hear her.
Really? Well, she misses your dad.
I miss him too. Sometimes crying makes you feel better, you know?
you killed the guy that killed my dad, huh?
Yes, Jack, I did.
I wish I could've done it.
some kids grow old too fast.
some don't grow old at all.
he didn't go gently into that good night.
stab wounds on both sides of the heart
coroner's investigator estimates the time of death is midnight to 2 am.
no blood trail, so he was dead when he was brought here.
no money. College parking pass. There's also a photograph.
I was thinking maybe it's his girlfriend.
we better find her and give her the bad news. Unless he was her stalker. In which case, it's good news.
driver's license with a Victorville address.
I bet I would've had cute kids.
and one day, maybe grandkids who'd put their tiny, little hands in mine.
tell me all about their day.
that'd been nice.
how-- how'd you find me?
well, Jimmy had a little picture of you in his wallet.
and his graphic design professor identified you.
how'd you guys meet, by the way, you and Jimmy?
I was workin'on the coffee house at campus.
I just looked up, and there he was.
all he said was "hey" .
and this weird calm came over me, like I knew him all my life. What happened?
I'm trying to figure that out. You know, it could have been robbery, but, uh, I gotta check all, all possibilities.
such as? -Uh, such as, at school?
anybody, anybody give him a problem there, maybe?
no. We didn't socialize much. Anytime we weren't together, he was doing his class work. He had a lot.
Yeah, I didn't realize you could, uh, go to college for--for, uh, comic books.
he was taking psychology of perception. He was taking color theory, analysis of form.
so it was hard work, and he was really good.
well, his teachers said that he was--he was really--he was talented.
anybody else that you can think of who might have wanted to do him harm in any way?
from his past, maybe? Victorville?
he didn't like to talk about his past much. He was an orphan.
he never knew his mom. His dad died in desert storm when he was 5.
so he was raised by foster parents?
group homes mostly. Every once in a while...
I'd see a bad memory come on him. And then he'd just draw in his sketchbook, and he'd feel better.
uh, is there anybody else I can talk to about Jimmy?
Yeah, Wally. He was the closest thing to family that Jimmy had.
Wally? What's his last name,
he's the guy that owns that comic book shop, the geek farm.
he used to be this big-shot comic book writer.
Jimmy would write him letters since he was a kid.
Wally was the one who convinced Jimmy to come out here and go to college.
Jimmy was writing a comic book with him.
it was really cool. The hero was this guy called "Payback."His family was murdered by the mob.
what you drawing there?
my newest superhero.
captain Raines.
and I like what you've done here. You've captured my enormous--enormous quads.
me and Jerome Bettis. The bulge is a little modest, but you don't want to scare the children.
I understand that. -That's what I was thinkin'.
so I guess we both moved here to follow our dream.
well, I came here 'cause I thought I was gonna be the next Raymond Chandler.
I thought if you live here, you write like him."Dead men are heavier than broken hearts" .
the big sleep. Great book.
did you read that? -No, I doubt it.
So...you came to the city of angels to become a writer, and ended up a cop.
I came to become a comic book artist and I ended up dead.
nice try. It's a little hokey.
don't blame me, man. I only exist in your head.
Hey, pal.
Oh. No, no, no. Thank you. Not a--not a drunk. Just, uh...crazy. Thank you.
I had this as a kid. -How much is that worth now?
about half what it was worth before you touched it.
to be honest with you, I, I wasn't aware.
um, and this one--this is $1, 000?
and you can't even look on the inside of it?
people buy high-end comics as an investment, okay?
when you break that seal, you invalidate the grade that Wally puts on it.
somebody wanna see me?
uh, Wally? -Yeah?
I'm, uh, detective Raines. I'm here about the Jimmy Davis murder.
did he have any issues with, uh, co-workers or, or customers?
no.
might he have been involved in anything that, uh, could have gotten him killed?
kids are stupid. Maybe he put himself at the wrong place at the wrong time.
you're freakishly tall. Why don't you put that up there for me.
" freakishly tall."You're too kind.
um, was he workin' the night he died? - Yeah, yeah.
did he say where he was going after? -Nope.
Wally, this guy saw the Ravensclaw Death Saber on the website.
he wants to know if he comes in, can he get it cheaper?
tell him if he comes into the store, I have to charge him more because then I have to look at his big fat face.
see, everything here is on the website. I don't even need a shop anymore.
and one of these days, I'm just locking the door.
Hey, I was talking to his girlfriend, and, uh, she said that, uh, for Jimmy, you were like a--you were like a father figure.
these kids are so screwed up, so starved for attention, you pat 'em on the head, they wanna move in with ya.
okay, well, thanks so much for your time, Wally. Here's my card.
if you think of anything, please just give me a call. Oh, and, uh...if I may. Thanks.
I never figured you for a Betty and Veronica fan.
a man can dream.
welcome to my home.
cheese puff?
no, thanks.
check this out.
come on.
it's this guy who commits suicide after his family's killed by the mob.
but after he's buried, he's reanimated when hazardous waste leaches into his grave.
I know the story. I was there when Jolie told me.
Yeah, but, see, it's really cool. He's invulnerable because he's already dead.
and he stays that way by ingesting toxic waste.
Ooh, that lunch box is gonna be a big, uh, big seller.
the turtle's unarmed. Don't shoot.
what is that, a tortoise? -Heh.
that's amazing.
did...I get killed here?
well, there's no forced entry, no sign of struggle, no visible blood. What is this?
nice bong.
I'm as surprised as you are, man.
well sure, now the tortoise makes sense.
it's the only pet that you can catch when you're stoned.
weed loosens me up to sketch.
5-year-old calls 911 as father overdoses. Not a war hero, quite.
I...
couldn't save him.
I always blamed myself.
you know how that feels.
what is this? A locked cabinet. What's in here?
bro, if it's one of those rubber suits with a zipper for the mouth, let's keep it on the down-low.
that's a lot of marijuana.
I have a serious drug problem.
no, you're a dealer. And that will definitely get you killed.
shouldn't I be different now that you found out I was a drug dealer?
I don't know for sure you were dealing. There could be other reasons the drugs were in there.
like what? -I'm working.
you didn't answer my question.
quiet time.
michael Raines, lapd.
your move, sweetie.
Jimmy was such a nice boy.
he helped me get my medicine for my glaucoma.
Yeah, is it possible that for right now we could put your medicine out?
could you put it out?
your candy dish. Hey, did you know any of the people who came over to Jimmy's, customers or--or friends?
is that cat breathing?
Oh, I hope not. She died years ago. I had her stuffed.
stuffed. Oh, like Roy Rogers with trigger.
Norman Bates did that--taxidermy.
that's the highest form of flattery, isn't it?
impersonation.
impersonation. I think you're right.
did Jimmy have any problems with anybody lately?
well, last week, he...
last week...?
I'm not a mind-reader. What about last week?
is it old age or the weed?
old age put her on the bicycle, but the weed's doing the pedaling.
I don't peddle drugs. I'm a consumer.
now let's get back to the argument with Sergei.
Sergei? Jimmy had an argument with somebody named Sergei?
you are a lightweight, aren't you, dear?
Yes. Jimmy had an argument out in the hall with Sergei.
that's the guy who owns the smoke shop.
he's a nasty man, but, oh-ho, wonderful bongs.
Yeah, what was the argument about, do you know?
well, something about Jimmy owing Sergei some money and--do you think he killed jimmy?
I'm gonna make sure to ask him that.
um, Margo, you have been a world of help, really.
I thank you so, so much for your time.
I really appreciate it.
these are for you.
what are those, cookies? -No, no.
shoes.
they were my Anthony's.
he was a big man, like you.
he walked everywhere. He loved seeing the city. He was a good man.
well, I'll, I'll take good care of them.
here, I got you something. Look at that. I don't know if ya like the girls. Betty and Veronica.
it's great. -You hate it.
no. I'm just more into ghost rider right now.
ghost rider? Oh, okay. Ghost rider. I'll remember.
Hey, you want some ice cream from the truck?
if you want to. -Ooh, I'd love to. That's my favorite
favorite thing: Getting food where it comes to you.
it's, uh, what it must have been like to be a prehistoric hunter.
see, that's the giant ground sloth, and we're creeping up on it until, just the right moment, when we spring forward and rip our nourishment out of the belly of the beast.
of course, that's only after paying and getting our napkins.
my dad said you were funny.
Yeah, well, I'm more of a physical comedian.
I'm what you call,"on funny."Some people are regular funny.
I'm on funny. That's from a movie. What are you gonna get?
my eye has fallen upon Eskimo Munch. That sounds vaguely inappropriate.
here, I'm torn between choco-nut, which is festive, and purple tongues. I never heard of that.
very--That's intriguing.
but I'm literally torn. I'm ripped in half. We may need some, uh
Hey, you okay?
someone said my dad's in a better place now.
how come the best place wasn't with me and my mom?
remember? -It's pizza night.
I'm not hungry.
what? I'll eat that pizza. I like your famous pizza.
thank you so much for picking him up.
sit, please. -Oh, thank you.
Ah, how's jury duty?
Oh, I'm not supposed to talk about it.
he's guilty.
how you doin'?
I'm cursing god less.
well, don't stop completely, you know.
I'm sure it's a welcome change from all those people, uh, sucking up and asking for stuff, you know.
Jack got into another fight at school.
he is so angry at the world.
well, the world hasn't been too great to him, you know.
how are you?
still talking to the victims?
Charlie told me you did that.
Oh. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's, uh, different without charlie.
in what way?
uh, it's hard to put into words.
let's talk about your case.
you like this victim. -Like him?
you identify with him.
talking with Jimmy, the young artist, puts you in touch with your creative self.
you know, I feel bad for him.
he had to watch his own father O. D. Right in front of him.
hmm, that would be pretty devastating.
oof.
you know, he had nobody to look out for him.
of course his life turned to crap.
you seem angry.
well, did this idiot think for one second what it would do to his kid?
you know, what kind of selfish father does something that he knows that sooner or later is gonna kill him?
what?
he lived a life he knew might kill him, and now that he's gone, you feel responsible for Jack.
he's been getting into fights at school lately.
children of homicide victims have a lot of rage.
sometimes I wish I could just, uh, reach in and take that pain out of him.
even if you could, I don't think you'd have any room left.
can we leave me out of it, please?
okay. Well, this has been, uh, just the best time I've ever had in my whole life.
you know, Jack is showing signs of childhood traumatic grief.
he can't mourn the loss of his father because any thoughts of him, even the happy ones, remind him of the terrifying way in which he died.
if that's true, how do I handle it?
bring him in here.
in here? -Yeah. I might be able to help.
I've worked with kids before.
I don't know if he's gonna want to talk about it.
well, I've also worked with people who are here against their will.
What'd you get for lunch? -Shoes.
that smart-ass attitude is exactly why you'll never get to have a captain's ulcer.
no, a very sweet doper old lady gave these to me.
uh, they belonged to her dead husband.
she thought they'd fit me. You're an 11, aren't ya?
I'm good for shoes.
what I could really use, though, is some old dead guy pants.
Really? Is this cordovan or oxblood? They go with everything.
I'm a 12, but a 15 feels so good.
how'd it go with Samantha today?
uh, we had a breakthrough, as a matter of fact. My problem is you.
I ask because I care.
and I want a heads up when you snap so I have time to find a place to take a clean shot from.
you'll spare me, right?
you'll need someone to explain the insane logic behind the rampage.
I'm writing a note.
Hey, I hear you've been hangin' with Jack. How's that goin'?
is everything all right?
uh, I've been picking him up after school.
Lisa's on jury duty.
is he still having a tough time?
I'm gonna try to get him to see, uh, Samantha.
well, give him my love.
you know anybody? -No.
anything new on your doper murder?
I'm gonna grab Boyer. We're going over to a head shop and interviewing this guy.
does anybody still call them head shops?
I wouldn't know. I drink.
never seen him before.
I'm sorry. I probably should have started with the fact that we have a witness who puts you last week at his apartment arguing with him--Jimmy.
must be different belo-Russian. We all look alike.
uh, maybe you didn't mean to kill him. Maybe, uh, uh, maybe Jimmy didn't pay you for the smoke, he rushed at you, you moved aside, and then he fell on a knife that you were holding. Twice.
I have nothing to do with drugs. This is tobacco accessories shop. Now I have business.
good-bye. -Uh, okay.
boyer, I asked you to meet me at the shop.
Oh, there you are.
the dog can't walk?
it's not threatening if you're carrying it.
look, all the other working dogs were, well, uh, working.
this is Sadie. She's retired.
did you have the cookies?
you have no respect.
this is no time for you to get defensive.
all right, here we go.
okay, everybody, listen up.
let me introduce you to narcotics officer Boyer and his, uh, k-9 partner...
um, no reason for alarm.
unless you're carrying illegal substances.
what kind of crap is this?
go.
what's wrong with your dog?
you've gotta be kiddin'.
Oh, boy, look
look at that determination.
nothin's gonna-- nothin's gonna stop her.
it's illegal.
I don't have drugs here.
I'm not looking for drugs.
I'm destroying your shop.
that sounded expensive.
okay, okay, stop the dog.
Boyer. -Yeah?
Oh, come here.
come here, Sadie.
that's a good Sadie. Who's still got it, huh?
Sadie's still got it.
tell me.
Jimmy owed me money.
for what?
what do you think?
but he paid me back couple days ago.
you just asked him politely, and he just paid you back?
there was some yelling. I'm emotional.
but I'm not stupid enough to kill a gangbanger.
Jimmy was a drug dealer.
Jimmy was shotcaller for the four-twenty mafia.
you got a problem, bitch?
background and an address on the four-twenty mafia.
Uh-huh, why haven't I heard of these guys?
they just came down from Victorville. Things got tense with the Vagos.
these guys are a stoner gang, white, mostly into dealing weed, some extortion.
our friendly neighborhood gangs can't be too thrilled with this.
you think he was taken out by locals?
dope's all about market-share.
Glen Bassett, 25. Street name, Surfer. He's the shot-caller now.
he just did a bid in corcoran for aggravated assault.
aggravated assault?
what happened to the good old days when, uh, potheads used to just stay at home and eat cookie dough and watch the, watch the shag carpet?
michael Raines, lapd.
I'm Glenn. They call me Surfer.
Hey, I thought you told everybody that I was coming over.
I did. Um, Jerry's kind of self-winding.
okay, gentlemen, I'm investigating the murder of your friend Jimmy Davis.
Jimmy's dead?
I told you he died.
I know. I just said he was dead.
you said it like a question.
no, I didn't just say it like it was a question.
Yes, you did. You went up at the end, like,"Jimmy's dead" ?
okay, now that we've established that, let me ask ya:
any of you guys know anybody who might have wanted to harm Jimmy?
everybody liked Jimmy, man.
everybody?
shoreline boys?
Culver city bloods?
did they like Jimmy as much as the Vagos liked you in Victorville?
What--what's happening here?
you look like dizzy gillespie there.
don't hold that in on my account.
there you go. That's healthier.
uh, all right. Not with me. Not with me. Let me right to the chase.
I think Jimmy may have been killed 'cause you guys took over the local weed trade.
if this is a gang thing, they ain't gonna stop with Jimmy.
no, you don't get it, man.
Jimmy was like my brother, man.
this is not a gang.
it's a family. We take care of each other.
don't be stupid. There are what, five of you guys?
if this is a gang thing, you're gonna have, uh, 50 homeboys each to deal with.
give me a name.
throwing the competition in jail is gonna be good for business.
all right, Tre.
from the Rolling Fifties.
what about him?
him and Jimmy had got into a beef a little while ago.
you got a last name?
he shouldn't be too hard to spot.
he's got a real specific smile.
Hey, I bet I can, uh guess which one of you is Tre.
Hey, what do they call a, a cow with no legs?
ground beef.
here, watch this. I can wiggle one ear at a a time. Watch.
Hey, Tre. There you are.
hello. I gotcha.
you thought I didn't see ya now, did ya?
you're kinda out there for a cop.
you have no idea.
so, uh, I'm investigating the murder of Jimmy Davis.
Hey, me and Jimmy had a few issues, but I didn't kill nobody.
he was on your turf dealing weed.
maybe one of your crew did it to send a message?
why would I cap him?
Jimmy was the only one of those fools with half a brain.
the rest of them stay blazed.
what about Surfer? -What about Surfer?
surfer's the muscle. He ain't a man of respect.
so you just let four-twenty deal on your streets?
you didn't get those teeth being, uh, Mr. Charity.
you should get, like, a gold cap, with like a diamond bullet.
that'd be hot, man.
it's on my Hanukkah list.
so, uh, convince me you had nothing to do with Jimmy's death.
look, man, they started dealing on my block.
but I knew Jimmy was smarter than that.
so I told him what'd happen if he continued.
I used my words.
he just stopped.
I guess they was the right words.
then how did they pay off Sergei?
look, man, I don't know. If you don't believe me what I'm tellin' you, ask Jimmy's girl.
she was at the sit-down.
Jolie? -Yeah.
she knew that Jimmy was in a gang?
seemed like she knew everything.
look, man, are we done?
I got a t-ball game to catch. My girl's batting a 500.
you're not gonna call him on that?
it's a ball on a stand.
how do you miss half the time?
500? That's--that's really great.
Yeah, I know.
coward.
I didn't want to bring him down.
I gotta go pick up Jack.
track down Jolie right away.
call her house, call her work, call her mother if you have to, but get her down here. Thank you so much.
Oh, wait--wait! Here.
what is that? -Oh, thanks a bunch.
no, the only kind of candy I eat is, uh, saltwater taffy from Atlantic city.
it's for Jack.
Charlie used to always get them for him out of the machine.
you're a very nice lady.
eh, I've been told.
you can still win.
first get ultimate dragon and black warrior magician in face-up attack positions.
then you equip the incredible fireball to handel the iron knight.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I have no idea what that means.
but here's a one-handed--here's a one-handed shuffle.
what do you think of that?
okay, okay.
um...
if there was something that you could do to make yourself feel better about, um, your dad, would you do-- would you do that, ever?
I don't know. Maybe.
Really?
well, I've got this, friend, a very nice lady, who helps people by talking to them.
she's really smart, and she's, you know, made a lotta--lotta people feel better.
did she make you feel better?
Yes, sir.
you suck at lying.
well...I don't know what to say to get you to at least try this.
so I tell you what, what if I just buy you something?
could I have cash instead?
no, you can't have cash.
Hi, pal.
you have fun?
Raines' gonna buy me something.
he'll make a great dad someday.
give us a second, okay, sweetie? -Okay.
okay.
thank you again.
so, um...
you think this woman can really help Jack?
uh, yeah, I do.
I'm always on call.
Hello?
I have Jolie in interrogation.
Yeah, good. I'll be right there.
if we don't solve a case in the first 48 hours, the chances that we ever solve it go down by half.
how come you didn't tell me the truth?
I didn't want you to write Jimmy off as some gangbanger who had it coming.
I don't work that way.
I'm sorry.
how long had Jimmy been in a gang?
since he was 12.
he said they made him feel like he belonged somewhere.
how long had he been the shot-caller?
a couple of years.
he never wanted it.
it just sort of happened.
people just followed him.
he wanted out of that life, so he--he came here?
Yeah.
I mean, Wally gave him the confidence to believe that he had the talent to be somebody.
you know, he stopped getting high.
he put all of his effort into school.
but...the gang was lost without him.
and what? They followed him down here?
Jimmy told them not to.
he told them that he was done, but then surfer got the Russian guy to front them the dope.
Jimmy just held onto it because he knew that they were gonna smoke it.
and then Tre shut him down...before Jimmy could sell it.
so where did Jimmy get the money to pay back Sergei?
I don't know.
jolie, don't lie to me.
however he got that money might have gotten him killed.
he had some comics that were worth a lot of money, and he was gonna sell one of them.
where did he get the comics?
Oh, come on, you know.
you just don't want to admit it.
I ripped off Wally.
you said he was going to sell one of them?
what did he do with the rest of them?
he asked me to hold onto them for him.
so the forensic artist's secret, uh, secret lair.
one.
wow, you did these?
Yeah, why are you so surprised?
they're good.
two.
one what? Two what? -Two slams.
third strike, you're out. You want my help or not?
Yeah, Mr. Sensitive, I do.
I mean, I'm an artist. I'm not a big time collector.
you should have gone to somebody who grades comics.
like Wally Anderson?
Yeah.
stanley, who do you have out there?
nobody, ma. Go back to sleep.
here, let me see 'em.
how much?
normally 5k a piece.
normally?
these are worthless. They're fakes.
I don't like having strangers in the house.
just say hi to her.
Hello, Mrs. Rastow.
it's, uh, michael-- michael Raines.
how were they faked?
scanned from an original, dropped out the color, recolored with an eyedropper
that's a bitch and a half--calendared paper, a little matte finish spray to give it that re-glossing pop.
who?
Raines, the tall one from the P. B.A. Picnic with the shoulders you like.
your mother has the hots for me?
she's losing her mind.
thus these shoulders are much admired.
that doesn't make any sense.
I'll give you the telephone numbers of several women.
the comics don't make any sense.
Oh. I'm sorry. How so?
well, the covers are impressive, but the guts are a hack job.
anybody who'd throw thousands at a comic would take one look at the splash page and know it's tweaked.
what if they were graded and slabbed?
that'd work.
but graders are like freakin' priests.
there's no way they'd certify a fake.
the comics came in these.
Wally's selling knockoffs? That's impossible.
the guy's like a Jedi-level nerd.
he'd never go to the dark side.
unless somebody forced him to.
okay, Wally's website.
" lord of the rings, Harry Potter"-- No.
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."Fantasy weapons, daggers"--Ooh, wait a minute.
bring that one up right there."The dragon's fangs" .
I didn't see that one in Wally's store.
they make two wounds.
we thought Jimmy was stabbed twice. Maybe not.
maybe Wally hit me once with this.
I need a want and warrant on Wally Anderson.
murder.
no.
cause you fired him?
Yeah.
Why?
because of these.
you thought you could turn his screwed-up life around.
so you gave him a job, you encouraged him, you worked on a comic book together.
you treated him like a son, and he repaid you with those.
you don't understand
he knew that selling those could ruin your reputation, your business.
everything you worked your whole life to build, he was willing to destroy.
Jimmy was a good kid. -But it was too late to save him.
the damage was too deep.
that's not true!
he played you. He used you.
just stop it!
it was those other losers that made Jimmy copy these comics.
how did you find that out?
because...
they sold one to a collector in Van Nuys, who, of course, was able to tell that these were fakes, traced them back to me.
and you connected it to Jimmy?
Yeah, when I confronted Jimmy about it, he told me about the drug debt.
so I told him I would pay the money if he would destroy the rest of the comics.
what else happened that night?
what did you say to Jimmy?
I told him I never wanted to see him again.
and I never did.
can I look yet?
okay.
I wish I could draw.
Oh, that's really great. Wow, I like all the action.
thank you.
can you tell me all the stuff that's going on?
okay, this is an evil robot with eight arms, kind of like doc ock, but not human at all.
he's about to attack this kid who's sleeping.
well, it's gonna be kinda hard for the kid to fight back because the robot blends into the darkness here.
it's a trap, see? This kid is not a real kid.
it's a bomb in the shape of a kid.
that's cool.
could you make me one where the bomb-kid blows up the robot?
that wouldn't really happen.
I'm kind of tired right now.
okay.
well, we're, uh, a little bit early. Your mom's not home yet.
wanna come up here with me? Slide up here with me.
sit in the big boy's chair. There you go.
Yeah, put your big shoes all over my--there you go.
there you go.
so you're not gonna say anything?
about what?
you know about what.
you just saw Samantha. Tell me. How'd it go?
she said I didn't have to tell anyone.
Oh, that's right. Well, you don't. You're, you're, you're absolutely right.
you know, I remember the day you were born?
your dad put on the siren and the big lights and raced over to the station.
he wanted to show us pictures of you.
he thought you were the most beautiful thing that he'd ever seen in his whole life.
I saw those pictures.
I was all puffy with a pointy head.
that's what I said. Yes, you were.
he was so proud of you, your dad, you know.
you know what he said?
he said, uh, he was a good man, but that you were gonna grow up to be a great man.
that's why you won't let me change.
if you keep me nice jimmy, you don't have to deal with the thought that I went bad because I didn't have a father.
Hey, how about some, uh, music?
because Charlie's dead, you're afraid the same thing will happen to Jack if you don't step up and do something.
but you don't think you're up to it.
that's kinda loud!
don't you kids like the music loud? Come on.
that's really bad for your ears, man.
answer me one question, I'll shut up.
Where's Charlie?
he's in your head like I'm in your head, right?
you've been with Jack all week.
so don't you think Charlie--the Charlie in your head--don't you think if he was worried about you taking care of Jack, don't you think you'd be seeing him every second of the day?
Samantha said I didn't have to talk, that I could just draw.
I knew what she was doing, but it was okay because I know the truth comes out when you draw.
what are you doing?
I'm betting that whoever killed you is in here.
in here where?
in here.
there we go. There we go.
what's going on?
uh, look at this.
these are panels that Jimmy did before he died for that comic book that you guys were workin' on, Payback?
he was the artist.
you were the writer.
tell me the story of these panels.
I can't. These are new. We never discussed this.
well, give it a try.
just, just give it a try.
payback is being attacked by an evil force, some sort of dark sea creature.
but he refuses to submit.
the evil force threatens to destroy an elder.
now, you see the way the elder's drawn sympathetically.
this is someone that Payback cares about.
okay.
here...
payback is making himself stronger.
he armors himself.
he goes after the evil force.
he attacks it.
he attacks it. Attacks it...
all right, listen to this. I'm gonna do another version.
only this time, Payback is Jimmy.
a dark force is puttin'the squeeze on Jimmy because somebody wants those copies from Jimmy of the comics.
he threatened to come after the sympathetic elder.
which is you.
look at the beard.
look how scared.
in this one, he's ingesting the toxic waste.
for the first time in six months Jimmy got high.
he armors himself.
he comes in here and steals the knife.
and then he went after the dark force, which he drew as a sea creature, because he thought it would be too on the nose if he just drew...Surfer.
it had to be Surfer.
surfer was the muscle, the violent one, and he was a lot stronger than Jimmy.
and while Jimmy was the smart one, that night he was stoned out of his mind.
and so it ended, not the way it does in comics, but the way it often does in real life.
okay, okay, he was stoned.
but what I don't understand is, if he knows the guy is dangerous, why does he go after him?
to protect you.
you were the closest thing that he had to a dad, Wally.
Oh, no.
can you get this bastard?
Hey, guys. Um...do you guys have any idea why we brought you down?
I'm, I'm hungry, man.
uh, munchies later. Why are you here? Why are you here?
Where's Surfer?
that's a good question.
why am I here?
cause you're special.
I, uh--I know you guys have a code where you don't like to talk to cops and tell 'em anything, so here's what we're gonna do.
I'll tell you what I think, and if I'm right, you don't say anything.
Jimmy was counterfeiting comics, Surfer saw that there was big money in it, pushed him to do more, and when Jimmy refused, he was killed.
you don't even know what you're talkin' about, bro.
okay, uh, here.
do any of you guys, uh, ever wonder why Jimmy quit smokin' pot?
the best as we could figure, he had some kind of mental breakdown or something.
man, I don't know. -Breakdown-- No.
six months ago, we busted him for possession.
Jimmy was an informant.
Jimmy wasn't a narc.
what is this, man?
if I tell you, it'll spoil the ending.
...not that he was gonna flip on you,'cause he refused to do that.
your problem is that the night that he was killed, Jimmy was wearing a wire.
Aw, don't listen to him, man.
shut up!
they can't hear you. - But even if he was, we're not on that.
well, the voices are very hard to hear on there, but lucky for us, Surfer's gonna testify that all you guys killed him.
he's lying! Don't say anything, man!
shut up!
what was that?
that's, uh, our captain beating a confession out of somebody, probably.
we had nothin' to do with Jimmy dyin'.
see, there's something really interesting about this tape.
you can hear Jimmy just fighting, fighting for his life real hard.
I guess 'cause for the first time in his life, he'd found something to live for.
but then at the end, it gets real, real quiet, and I swear, you can hear Jimmy breathin' his last breath.
listen to this. - No!
we didn't kill Jimmy.
surfer, he--he did it on his own, man.
he's a putz, man. -We got him.
we didn't even know until after, when he came home with his arm all bleeding.
why was he bleeding?
Jimmy hit him once with a knife.
let's see what's on the arm.
that looks like it hurts, sweetie.
Hey, I can give you the murder weapon.
surfer told you to dump it.
it's a collectible, man.
why do you always hit me?
they're gonna like you where you're goin'.
you're kinda cute. Wear your hair up.
dark Horse says they might want to publish it.
they're trying to decide if it'll sell.
hmm, what do you think? Is it cool?
it's tight.
it'll sell.
Jimmy would have loved this.
Hey, have you seen the cover he was working on?
he never showed me a cover.
come here. Come here. Come here.
does the beautiful archangel remind you of anyone?
he never told me.
see, I told you he wasn't a bad guy.
jolie, I never, I never doubted it for a second.
can I have this one?
you certainly can. That's gonna be yours. And I'm gonna buy you the, uh, my favorite when I was a kid: Tiny Mighty Titan.
look at that. -That's okay.
I'll just get mine.
wait a minute. What's wrong with my superhero?
he's kind of lame.
okay, I'm buying it, and I'm making you read it out loud unless
here--you can come grab it from me.
you can't. Nope!
all the great California guys of the '40s and '50s.
I even tried writing a story once.
couldn't get past page one, too many decisions.
where do you find the body?
cause all these stories start with a body, right?
do you find it by a pool under a sunset the color of a blood orange?
or is it night, with the twinkling lights of the city?
and what about the victim?
a movie producer in a sharkskin suit who we think probably got what he deserved...
some beautiful starlet who fell in with the wrong crowd and never saw it coming...
but you know the real reason that I never wrote one of those stories?
I became a cop.
and I found out the images that I had in my head weren't like real life.
take the case that I got this morning.
the body wasn't found by a swimming pool high in the hills.
it turned up in a parking lot by the 101.
and the victim wasn't some movie weasel or starlet.
it was a poor young woman in cargo pants and sneakers with a bullet hole in her back, laying face down on the pavement.
we did a close sweep, the trash cans, bushes.
no purse, no wallet.
I got the registration.
sandy Boudreau, 121 Bendix Avenue, apartment 12.
let's go check it out. - Okay.
we're going to Bendix.
this is it, the apartment's up there somewhere.
that tower's the elevator.
apartment 12.
start knocking on doors.
I don't know if you'd like that.
who are you? - You first.
Raines, lapd.
are you her sister or something?
do you see one in the photographs?
I didn't have a sister, detective.
you didn't have a sister.
you being? - Sandy.
I think his name is Marco, but they broke up, uh, a few weeks ago.
detective!
Boudreau had a boyfriend.
keep knocking.
keep knocking.
sandy Boudreau, that's the victim's name.
that's right.
so it's happening again. - Happening again.
I can't do this, Charlie, can't handle it. - You handled it before.
if you call that handling it.
I'm losing my mind. - Are you?
Oh, I don't know, I just had a conversation with a girl who wasn't there. What'd you call it?
I wouldn't exactly call that a conversation.
the girl says her name and you run out the door.
not only is that bad police work, that's rude.
okay, I don't know why I bother talking to you.
maybe because I carried your ass for 13 years. - You carried me?
first case on your own, you already need my help.
no. The only help I need from you on this case is figuring out why this is happening to me. Why she's haunting me.
Oh, she's a ghost now. - Hallucination.
you know she's not a ghost. - Hallucination.
it's all in your head, right, exactly, Michael. It's all you.
look, you have two choices, right? You could run away and get yourself committed to some institution, - and get shot up with tranquilizers. - Tranquilizers.
that sounds good, tranquilizers. - Or you can do your job.
go back there, see what she wants. Just talk to her.
look, the victim has always been your thing, right?
know the victim, find the killer. Know the victim, find the killer.
that's right.
you used to talk to the victim while we were driving around.
well, but I didn't see-- I didn't see them!
you know, that was behind my eyes. Now, now it's, uh, you know, out there.
look, maybe this will make you a better detective.
Oh, shut up.
what do you want?
it's your imagination, detective. I'm just the figment.
what do you want?
I want you to find out who killed me.
then you'll go back to whatever dark, twisted, malfunctioning part of my brain that you come from?
Yeah.
what are you writing?
uh, a note instructing whoever finds my body after I blow my brains out to scatter the ashes over Disneyland 'cause it's the happiest place on earth.
you always this sarcastic?
who are you calling?
you're calling me.
Hi, y'all, this is sandy.
I'm not here right now, leave a message. Bye.
well, you got a Texas accent.
well, now isn't that an interesting development?
easy on the drawl there, Tex. You're not riding the back 40 at Crawford.
sounds like you came here when you were a kid.
whatever you say, detective. You're the boss.
fashion show.
sweet, vintage-Y.
kind of a sweater girl.
and a wet suit.
fantastic voyage.
cheerleader.
what's the story here?
maybe they're for Halloween?
I can see the jumping, the twirling.
that's good.
Hey, that check out there. Does that mean you were working for a catering company?
if you say so.
wanna tell me what this is all about?
I really wish I could help you, detective.
I only know what you know.
Raines. - Hey, it's Caroline.
Caroline, what's up? - We got the perp on your 187.
are you serious? - That's what the captain says.
I'll be right there.
you said if I caught whoever killed you, you'd go?
Yeah. - Then go.
we got your killer.
they found the suspect in one of the homeless camps in Griffith park he had Sandy Boudreau's purse with him, containing, among other things, $950 in mixed 20s and 50s.
he also had blood on him.
matches type with Boudreau.
his name is William Jones, known to the residents of the camp where he lives as skunk.
and they call him that because he's got a big white stripe down his back?
no.
Oh, my god.
Mr. Jones.
I didn't do it. - I'm glad.
I smell bad, don't I? - Whoo.
keeps the sickos away. - The sickos?
the ones that come up into the camps.
take our stuff, beat on us.
you got skunk on you?
I find their dens, poke 'em with a stick, and get 'em to spray me.
doesn't it bother you?
I got kicked in the head back in '86, ain't smelled a thing since.
didn't do it. - You sure about that?
uh, arresting officer says you couldn't remember anything about last night.
I didn't do it. - You know that you didn't do it?
or you know that that's not the kind of thing that you could ever do?
we've all got a dark side, Mr. Jones.
I know I do, stuffed way down deep inside that I don't even wanna think about.
cause I'm a good guy. Like you're a good guy.
but I know what'd happen if that dark stuff ever got out.
what I'd be capable of.
but I'm not gonna do it 'cause I'm a good guy.
just like you. When I'm in control.
and I'm always in control.
almost always.
you a drinking man, Mr. Jones? - You know I am.
were you drinking last night? - You know I was.
but I didn't do it. - Didn't do it or can't remember?
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
process him.
you call that a confession?
they found the victim's wallet on him, the victim's blood on him.
no gun, no powder residue on his hands.
maybe he found her already dead and robbed her.
or maybe he shot her, threw away the gun, and washed his hands.
well, that would be the first thing he's washed in a long time.
what about that shoebox full of cash?
what about it, Nancy Drew? That could be anything.
now, I suppose to a civilian employee like you, everything seems mysterious.
everything seems important. - Okay.
the truth is, is most things in most murder investigations don't mean a damn thing.
that's what we learn in detective school.
process him.
Oh, she's gone.
Oh, she wasn't at the station, she wasn't in my car.
gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone.
Oh, one question. - Shoot.
is she gone? - Gone.
Yeah, thank goodness!
Yes, good, well, who killed Sandy Boudreau?
some poor old wino.
a wino with a . 38?
Yeah.
not gone?
not gone.
she's right there right now? - Yes, roller skates and everything.
that is so cool. - No, Charlie, it's not cool.
she was supposed to go away. Sweetie, you were supposed to go away.
well, maybe you haven't solved the case yet.
the guy had her blood on him, her wallet.
Nah, maybe you haven't solved it to your satisfaction.
what's that mean? - Pretend we're still partners, right?
we're in the car, we're driving around, right? You've gone all silent because something is nagging you.
she had a bank account.
so what was she doing with $20, 000 in a shoebox?
tips from her catering job?
20, 000 in tips, that's some catering job.
and what about the cheerleading outfit, the school uniform, the wet suit?
she liked to play dress up.
she cute?
mm, she's cute.
LAPD, Caroline speaking. - Caroline, this is Raines.
do not, I repeat, do not say I told you so, but hold off on processing the wino.
I told you so.
thank you, Caroline.
Yeah, they cater all right. It's called " Romeo & Juliet" .
Romeo & Juliet.
Jackson, over in vice, says it's an escort service.
and what's the address?
it's on sunset, 700 block, down by Gower.
Thanks, Caroline.
tell me about the catering company that you work for.
seems to me you already know.
it was a front for the Romeo & Juliet escort service.
see? I was right.
you already knew.
why didn't you tell me you were a prostitute?
because it never occurred to you.
may I ask a question?
did you find any cigarettes?
why am I smoking?
maybe for the same reason I'm drinking, even though you didn't find any booze.
same reason my makeup's headed for circus clown, and my boobs have gained three cup sizes.
you found out I'm a whore.
and this is what a whore looks like, right?
thank you.
that catering job must've paid well.
the view is nice.
Ah, it's stupid to pay for a view.
your eyes are closed most of the time.
I wondered where that went to.
what?
that duck with four legs she made in the third grade.
Hey, would you take your little trip down memory lane some other time?
we gotta find it before the cops do, otherwise we'll never see it.
that's my mama.
Shh! They can't hear me, you know that.
sorry, lapd.
uh, detective Raines.
you're Sandy's parents?
Yeah.
what are you doing here?
my job.
uh, what are your names?
Vernon and Arlene.
I think he figured that much out, Arlene.
what you hoping to find here, Chester?
are you deaf?
I just said my name is Vernon.
Mm-hmm. There's money here.
Mm-hmm. Daughter was sending her little bits so I wouldn't know.
she said there was more for her.
Chester, anything we find in here is evidence.
evidence, my ass.
everything in here belongs to me.
and why the hell do you keep calling me Chester?
honest mistake.
see, I didn't even know that your daughter had a father.
your wife I recognized from the photos.
nice to meet you, ma'am.
but see, in the photos, you're missing, Chester.
not just missing, you're cut out.
all that's left of you is your arm.
why would Sandy do that?
I wonder.
so I was calling you Chester 'cause it rhymes with molester.
should've noticed that your father's arm in that photo was a heavily...
Heavily-muscled arm.
why'd you say that to him?
very few people get into your line of work because having sex with strangers for money was their favorite booth on career day.
nine times out of ten, they were molested.
you have no idea.
he'd come into my room every night-- Sandy.
he didn't molest you.
well, then why'd you say he did?
to check the reaction, not his, your mother's.
mothers always know what's going on, even though they say they don't.
your mother looked like I was talking martian.
now, Arlene!
don't stand there like a heifer!
get in there, come on!
is this what you want?
get my lawyer on the phone!
now, Arlene! Calm down!
let's go, go!
call my lawyer!
of course, just because you weren't molested doesn't mean you weren't abused.
he knocked you around, didn't he?
well, there's gotta be some reason I'm a hooker.
is that it?
I know that he beats your mom.
how in the hell do you know that?
he's quick with his fists, and she flinches when he talks.
you're just doing everything you can to make me sympathetic, aren't you, detective?
you wanted to solve the murder of a sweet, young college student.
but a white trash hooker?
no, it wouldn't matter to me if you were the queen of the rose parade.
I just want to solve your murder and say sayonara.
nothing personal, Sandy.
your ex-partner.
how'd he get the cane?
took a bullet three months back.
several bullets...we both did.
he got the worst of it.
what happened?
wrong place, wrong time.
uh, we were on Yucca, looking for a guy, and this idiot crank dealer named Laszlo saw us, thought we were rival drug dealers, came out and just opened up.
we fired back.
one of my bullets went in through Laszlo's eye and out the back of his head.
so he's dead.
Yeah. That'll pretty much kill you.
I know, I was kidding.
where we going, detective?
to see your pimp, Sandy.
detective Raines, lapd.
you know this girl? Sandy Boudreau.
sandy boo-what?
how long you gonna run that play?
we both know how it ends.
she in some kind of trouble?
not anymore, she's dead.
I need the names of her clients, start with her regulars.
she wasn't working much anymore.
she was going to school.
trying to get out of the life.
give me your customers this past month.
well, she only had one.
came in through the website on Monday.
I sent her to the townhouse motel on sunset.
look, there's no way I can tell you who was here on what day, and in what room.
uh, she could've been dressed like a cheerleader.
a cheerleader.
Yeah, that, uh, that rings a bell, actually.
a cheerleader.
she'd just twisted her ankle, uh, so she might've been using a cane.
a cane, yeah, actually, you're right.
now it's all coming back to me.
her face was made up like a mime?
it's funny you say that 'cause I remember thinking, "what's up with this mime makeup?
you know, she had this
Oh, okay, aah, all right.
that hurts.
I certainly hope so.
is that security camera outside real?
and don't lie.
you lying to me doesn't work so good.
you picked me to do this because you don't like me.
no, I picked her to do this because one day she's gonna be a lead detective.
you can go scratch your butt with a rake for all I care.
press play.
I'm gonna file a grievance.
of course you are.
press play.
we got Sandy Boudreau's cell phone records.
so while I'm out talking to them, you see if any of these people went to the motel.
Yeah, okay.
walk with me.
how you doing? You okay?
why, because I accused Boudreau of being a child molester?
Nah, it was nothing, everyone does that.
I do that five times a day.
Yeah, can I have a tall mocha, you child-molesting bastard?
you shouldn't say that.
you don't say that, do you?
grieving father-- the only thing on his mind upon entering his dead daughter's apartment was "where's the money" ?
where is the money?
I spent it on lottery tickets.
did you get me some?
do I look like an idiot? Of course I did.
Dan, the money's in evidence.
Mrs. Boudreau's begging us to drop charges against husband Vernon.
no surprise, classic abused spouse.
I don't think we're gonna get a conviction for him hitting you.
you know, grieving father, inflammatory words.
I know. - Good.
and you're okay?
Yeah, Dan.
Why?
boyer says he's seen you talk to yourself.
I was talking to myself.
well. If you ever want someone more interesting to talk to, my door is open.
it's good to have you back, Michael.
is this where I say, " it's good to be back" ?
Oh, no, no, no, this is where you say something clever to remind me how smart you are.
I'm rusty, give me a couple days.
no.
I'm sorry, I...honey, do you recognize her?
no.
uh, she made a call to a cell belonging to your husband two nights ago.
must've been a wrong number.
call lasted four minutes.
maybe the housekeeper borrowed one of the phones?
Oh, is she here now?
no, but she'll be back tomorrow.
have her call me, would you?
sure.
thanks so much.
okay.
you're welcome.
was he lying?
could be.
he wouldn't say anything with his wife standing there.
where now?
uh, the neighbor said that you had a boyfriend named Marco up until a few weeks ago.
he called you 12 times the day you died.
uh, your roommate said you'd be here.
I'm here about Sandy Boudreau.
where were you two nights ago?
I was here from 7: 00 till midnight.
you want me to prove it?
not yet.
you and Sandy, uh, met here?
she used to do leg lifts on that machine over there.
I used to watch her.
she was just so beautiful.
until one day she asked me to spot her on the bench.
what else do you wanna know, man?
well, why'd you and Sandy break up?
was it because of her job?
Marco, if you're trying to protect her, I already know what she did.
she dumped me.
I didn't care.
you didn't care that your girlfriend was a hooker?
all right, I did, but...
I thought she could stop.
and she said she couldn't because she needed money for her mother.
for her mother?
and I told her that I could give her whatever money she needed, and she said, "how is that any different than what I'm doing now?
and she didn't want to see me anymore.
so I was thinking, maybe if I was different...
you know, like it was my fault.
but now I'm thinking maybe I had nothing to do with it.
maybe something else was going on that I didn't know about.
maybe she wasn't into guys.
you thought she was gay?
Yeah, sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
some girl doesn't want to see you anymore, and she must be gay, right?
Yeah.
you think he did it? The boyfriend?
you know how I work, Charlie.
I think everybody did it, then I slowly whittle away the ones who couldn't.
it feels like, um, I'm...passing?
I'm talking to these people.
I'm asking my questions.
you're going through something extremely weird.
well, you're still working the case.
getting the job done.
there's nothing wrong with that.
Hey, it's Caroline.
I'll be right there.
give her my regards.
there we go."To the detective on the Sandy Boudreau case, Vista Heights investigations" .
that private eye creep down on Hollywood Boulevard?
the same.
what you got for me, Laird?
my, my...
the victim and Harry Tucker, the guy with the cell phone.
Wow.
why'd you lie?
because Wendy was right there.
Mm-hmm, you helped a nice young woman clean up spilled coffee.
why would you have to keep that from your wife?
she's been very suspicious of me.
she have reason to be?
I did something stupid on a business trip two years ago, and Wendy says that she's forgiven me, but sometimes I don't know.
I think Wendy is afraid that I'm going to leave her for a younger model, and I'm not.
how did Sandy Boudreau get your cell phone number?
I don't know.
maybe you left it on the table at the motel after you made sweet monkey love to her?
no, we never...I spoke to her.
what's his motive?
maybe she, uh, threatened to tell his wife.
maybe she saw him naked and laughed.
it always comes down to penis size, doesn't it?
pretty much.
we got a match from the motel security video.
him?
no.
okay, go in tighter and freeze it.
the ex-boyfriend.
do not move!
all units, suspect heading west down the alley.
a garbage truck.
Yes, sir.
your boy Marco's probably peddled his way to Mexico by now.
I got through to Mcsweeney. He's line three.
mcsweeney the private eye?
that guy's an ass-wipe.
who wants to know?
Oh, this is detective Raines.
I'm trying to reach Laird Mcsweeney.
Mike, you're talking to detective Smith, central.
I'm afraid you talking to Laird Mcsweeney's gonna be a bit of a problem.
tell the M. E. He can send his people up.
how long has he been dead?
couple hours, give or take.
you know him?
uh...yeah, our paths crossed.
he was a private eye.
mostly peeper work, divorce cases, custody battles, suspicious spouse...
but he also liked to cross the line.
take some pictures, then ask for money.
blackmail.
that's what they call it.
camera's gone.
seems so.
computer too.
maybe somebody didn't like the kind of pictures that he was taking.
huh, it seems that somebody didn't know that Laird had a backup hard drive.
so I guess there's the coffee spilling thing he mentioned.
then I guess, uh, they're gonna sit down together.
just them having coffee.
nothing of them making the beast with two backs?
no, but there is this last group.
he's taken off.
she's just leaving.
she's just walking across the street.
leaving by herself.
she knew the pictures were being taken.
say, can I have some privacy, guys?
I'm making a...I'm on a classified call here, sorry.
penthouse is nice.
what a nut, he's gonna do it.
Ugh. You knew the pictures were being taken.
first time you tried blackmail?
you tell me.
no, I wanna hear it from you.
mcsweeney and I decided to target a wealthy, middle-aged, married fella.
one who had never dreamed that a fox in socks like yours truly would want to jump his bones.
all I had to do was get him in bed.
mcsweeney would snap some candies, and we'd threaten to show 'em to the wife...
forget it.
it's not right.
it's like all of a sudden you turned into Kathleen Turner from " Body Heat" .
and what's with the cigarette?
you weren't blackmailing anybody, Sandy.
you're not that kind of person.
what kind of person am I?
the kind who saves money to send to her mother to escape her horrible husband.
whore with a heart of gold?
Yeah, something like that.
then why was I killed?
I don't know, I got a couple of suspects, no motive.
why do people usually kill people?
uh, greed, ambition, anger, fear.
what about love?
detective! Detective!
they located Marco.
we're waiting on you.
primary move.
last call for the San Francisco express.
last boarding call for the San Francisco express.
everybody move, take him down.
all units respond, yeah, yeah.
unit to the bus station.
I was hoping you'd put him in handcuffs, not in traction.
I was responding, he comes out of nowhere!
does he have a pulse? - yeah.
what the hell's wrong with you?
he came out of nowhere.
you are lucky, he is still breathing.
police emergency, out.
what? Now!
come on--no washing, no washing!
go, go, go, go, go, scoot! Scoot!
you said that the motive might be love, but Marco didn't kill you, did he?
if he didn't, then why was he running away?
we found steroids and speed in his apartment. Did he kill you?
why would he? He already knew I was a hooker.
maybe he wanted that shoebox money.
then why didn't he take it?
huh. Maybe he found out something else about you.
I like to bite the heads off of chickens?
he followed you to the motel.
what did he say?
she says she couldn't because she needed money for her mother.
and I told her that I could give her whatever money she needed, and she said,"how that any different than what I'm already doing" ?
she didn't want to see me anymore.
so, I thought what can I do different?
thought it was my fault.
then again, maybe it didn't have anything to do with me.
like, maybe she wasn't into guys.
why would he think you didn't like guys?
you liked guys, didn't you?
as far as I know.
what would make him think I didn't?
where you going?
to talk to Marco and look at the motel security video again.
Why?
I think I know who killed you.
I never found any evidence of Harry going to the townhouse motel and hiring Sandy.
because I didn't go there.
I know that you didn't, Harry.
believe me, I kept hoping that you'd show up, but you didn't.
but somebody else did, somebody that we weren't looking for at first.
I don't...I don't understand.
that doesn't mean anything.
what motive could Wendy possibly have?
love.
or at least the kind of love that's been deformed by a fear of abandonment.
Wendy was terrified of being your ex-wife.
I just want you to follow my husband around for a few days.
so she hired a private investigator to have you followed.
and when he didn't find anything, she couldn't let it go.
she set a honey trap.
she paid Sandy Boudreau to seduce you.
and Mrs. Tucker, before you say that you didn't, I've got a witness, her ex-boyfriend, who, when he gets out of the hospital, will testify that he saw you at a motel, handing Sandy money.
and we've got your thumbprint from a $50 bill that we found under Sandy's body.
so...
you all right? Hold on.
Harry meets Sandy.
you okay? - Peeper's taking pictures.
I-I'm harry, by the way. - Sandy.
delighted. - I do.
did you grow up here? - I did not.
look at that! Oh, look at that.
take good care, all right?
everything's going great. One small problem, Harry doesn't take the bait.
and that's where the story could've, should have ended.
but it didn't, did it?
when she called you, you met in that parking lot, she said she wanted to give back the money.
I'm not gonna take the money back. - He wants you, just accept that!
I want you to go back and try again!
you wouldn't take it.
you wanted her to keep trying.
you couldn't accept that your husband could be faithful.
she said something to you, and then she headed back for her car.
and whatever she said to you got you so angry or so scared, that you snapped.
what, honey? What did she say?
she said...
you know what? I'm gonna try it again.
I'm gonna give him the money back next time I see him.
I'm gonna tell him everything!
I didn't mean to kill her, detective.
I just wanted to stop her.
I know.
I bet your legal team will argue, successfully, that it was a crime of passion, or that the gun just went off.
and you might only get manslaughter for killing Sandy Boudreau.
but Mcsweeney, the private eye...
...that was premeditated.
you might just get the needle for that.
you're still here.
you know, I'm startin' to think you don't like me.
I like you fine, Sandy Boudreau.
I wish I'd known you.
but, uh, you said you'd go if I caught your killer.
yet here you are.
is there something else I can do for you, Sandy?
there is one thing.
tell me.
I don't need this crap in the house.
all right, Vernon.
I'm not keepin' --oh, god.
so sorry to startle you, Mrs. Boudreau.
um, I needed to talk to you alone.
what about?
I've got some bad news.
there was a screw up at the evidence locker, and Sandy's money has gone missing.
what?
Oh, Vernon will not be pleased.
what's this?
I'm sorry that the money's missing, Mrs. Boudreau, because I know that Sandy wanted you to have it.
she wanted a better life for you.
she would done just about anything to help you.
of course, even if somehow the money were to magically reappear, you still might just hand it over to Vernon, or, you might not.
either way, it'd be up to you.
see that CD?
may I have that?
uh, it's in the trash.
detective!
was Sandy mixed up in something?
no.
she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Oh. Okay.
Thanks.
for not telling my mama I was a prostitute.
no point in that, dear.
no point in that.
now, come on, Arlene, would you kick it into gear?
I wanna get the hell out of L. A. And back to Texas.
okay.
looks like your mother finally...
all right, all right.
it's probably rap.
is she gone?
so far.
I keep looking.
Hey, what if this happens with every case I get?
that would be cool.
no, Charlie, it would not be cool.
I don't like being crazy. - You're not crazy.
you just have an active imagination.
I mean, you're always going on about how you wanna be a writer.
that's what writers do, right?
they create characters. - Yeah, but do they actually see 'em?
no. And if they do, they're...cuckoo for cocoa puffs.
well, maybe it's just because you need someone to talk to.
without me in your car, you've got no one to bounce your ideas off of.
Yeah.
maybe I should get a new partner?
please.
who is gonna partner with you?
Why? 'Cause I'm crazy? - Because you're a jerk.
I'm rubber, you're glue. Whatever you say, bounces off me, sticks to you.
it's not so bad, is it?
you solved her murder, she went away.
Yeah.
but if more of them come along, you positive that they'll disappear every time?
Yep.
it didn't happen the first time, now did it?
and I caught that killer. In fact, I put a bullet in his eye.
and you're still here.
maybe because I'm here for a different reason, Michael.
like what?
I don't know.
guess you're gonna have to figure that out.
one thing that's been bugging me. Why do you have me walking around with this cane?
cause you got shot, it seemed right.
Yeah, if I got shot in the leg. I got capped in the noggin.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but I didn't feel like looking at you with a, you know, hole in your head.
lose the cane. Wanna lose the cane?
thank you.
Yeah, lose the cane.
Hey.
who were you talking to?
the dead.
they hunger for human brains. The feasting will begin at sundown.
jerk.
I know.
then again, the dangers we perceive aren't often the real ones.
take our local fireman, Tony Vera. The guy on the boardwalk.
last time he burned himself it was taking a chicken out of the oven.
but when he coats his mouth with that lighter fluid?
every slug that he ingests, every accidental nip eats away a little more of his liver.
or take my job.
jealous husbands with switchblades, crackheads with semi-automatics.
does that sound perilous?
in the entire lapd, we had one cop killed in the line of duty last year.
and only one the year before.
well, we did have 13 suicides, though.
shame they don't make kevlar for the things we see.
are you thinking about killing yourself?
detective?
Yeah.
I asked you a question.
you mentioned suicide, I've gotta ask.
are you thinking about killing yourself?
every time I walk in this office.
I'm not thinking of killing myself.
all right.
you also mentioned kevlar for the things you see.
were you referring to the vests?
well, I didn't mean the canoes.
these things you experience, that you see, you think that they're harmful?
maybe. I don't know.
why don't you tell me about the case?
I thought you knew about the case. You said you saw it on the news.
then why don't you tell me?
we found the body of a ten-year-old girl.
she'd been stuffed into a duffel bag.
KT? What do we got?
petechial hemorrhaging, for one.
strangulation?
no facial congestion, or neck contusions.
broken neck?
that's my guess.
she's missing two buttons.
and a third is unbuttoned.
you think her mother let her leave the house that way?
Boyer. - Yeah?
we need to throw up a tent.
you worried about the gulls?
no, we need to remove the victim's clothes, and run a rape kit.
she can't be more than ten years old.
I'm gonna need the keys to your patrol car.
Boyer? - Yeah?
the keys to your patrol car!
have you figured out who did it yet?
no, not yet.
how about now?
you're not very good with kids, are you?
Adam 9 just called in a missing person's report on a ten-year-old south of rose.
we're uploading it to the CWS database now.
give me the highlights.
Emily Strong, 4'2," red hair, light brown eyes.
what was she wearing?
pink ruffled top and denim capris.
Yeah, that's her. Uh, you got an address?
1892 Indiana court. It should be up on the CWS by now.
Thanks.
so I have a name.
your name is Emily.
Yeah, he's with him now.
I gotta call you back.
detective.
what do you know?
girl went to Westley, had an early dismissal today, mother had no idea.
she walk to school?
Westley let out at 1: 00, mom didn't realize she was missing till 3: 00.
I wanna know why you are not looking for my daughter.
we told you everything we know.
that's the father, he just came home.
you need backup in there?
you wanna tell him his daughter's dead, be my guest.
I... I have to... oh, my god.
I--I can't...
I can't believe...
Mr. Strong... Henry.
Why--why wouldn't she have told us she had a half day?
Henry, I know this is difficult, but we need to focus on finding out who did this, and on bringing that person to justice.
Any--anything you need. - Thank you.
I'm gonna need to ask you a few que
detective?
Yeah, just a few questions.
hasn't he been through enough?
it's standard procedure.
go ahead.
when was the last time you saw Emily?
this... this morning, before I went to work. - And you were at work all day?
Yes, until Judy called. - You didn't go out for lunch?
no, I ate at my-- - Why are you asking him these questions?
could Emily play the piano?
what?
the piano, can she play?
she was just starting to learn.
excuse me, were you just suggesting that I might have killed--?
a young victim in these circumstances, chances are she knew her attacker, which is why...
I'm sorry. Under what circumstances?
we think your that daughter might have been sexually assaulted before she was killed.
Henry - I told you, I was at work all day.
do you mind if I, ah, look around?
that wasn't very nice.
I had to gauge his reaction.
his reaction to the fact that I might have been assaulted before I was killed?
Hey, why don't you go play with your dolls?
want to do that?
I'm tired of my dolls.
what's assault?
none of your business.
fine.
you like Nancy Drew?
never read any.
Really? She's a schoolgirl detective.
I bet she could solve my murder.
I was just starting to learn that song.
my dad was gonna play it with me.
lucky him.
Hey, maybe you could play it with me.
Ugh, maybe not.
why are you so cranky?
why are you so annoying?
I don't know.
maybe it's easier if I'm annoying.
easier?
you know, to deal with the fact that I was murdered.
that I'm dead for no good reason.
okay, isn't there--?
there's got to be something in here to keep you busy.
I could play with my computer.
there you go.
I mean, there's so much to do, so many people to talk to.
I just love I'm, don't you?
who were you chatting with, Emily?
something wrong?
no.
don't you want to know who I'm iming?
wait a minute. You can't...
im without an e-mail account.
she had an e-mail account.
Henry was so protective.
he didn't want her to have it.
I tried to read everything.
she only e-mailed with a few other girls.
can you show me her account?
the Tobmans called. Grace, she told them...
she told them she and Emily lied about the early dismissal.
grace, that's one of Emily's school friends?
they snuck down to the beach.
Henry, where are you going?
you don't want to go outside.
I need to talk to her. - No, that's not such a good idea.
I have to do this! I have to do something.
no, please-- He's taking no questions.
don't answer any questions. No questions.
uh, Henry, listen to me, the best thing you can do right now is to sit down and start working on a list of adults who knew Emily.
you don't understand. - I do understand, Henry.
but you gotta let me do my job.
uh, could you give me the Tobmans' number? Please.
and if you could jot down Emily's, uh, e-mail address and password.
you don't think that--? - No, no, I'm just being thorough.
you don't want to tell her that 65% of sexual solicitations occur through im and chat?
what exactly is a sexual solicitation anyway?
Lance. - It's Raines.
Yeah, the media's all over this, so I'm gonna call the family of the little girl who last saw Emily, send her in.
make sure there's somebody there to roll out the welcome wagon.
Yeah, no problem.
great. While I've got you,
I'm gonna need a background check on Emily Strong's buddy list and e-mail address book.
you got a login and a password?
Estrong@friendpost. Net Password is lion tamer.
as in Siegfried?
uh, I'm guessing that's not who she had in mind, but yeah.
is that Raines?
boyer wants to talk to you.
Boyer? Really? What, is it my birthday?
Hey, detective.
listen, I'm making a list of suspects from the N. E.C. S. Database.
now, I figured I'd target sex offenders that live in the Strongs' neighborhood.
you're taking initiative? Really? Is this Remi Boyer?
should I be targeting them by crime?
I don't want you to strain anything.
rape? Sodomy?
Yeah, sure. Anything with a child victim.
and make sure to include guys convicted of se...
hold on, one second.
shouldn't you be in the back seat?
it's my car. And my head.
fine.
uh, yeah. Make sure to include guys convicted of...
...of, um, Sexual abuse or lewd and lascivious acts with a child.
what?
sexual abuse or lewd and lascivious acts with a child.
why were you whispering?
because it's easier if I think that you can't hear.
which I guess sounds pretty stupid, doesn't it?
no stupider than making me sit in the back seat.
that's correct.
if I'm so innocent, what was I doing sneaking down to the beach?
Mr. Tobman, this is Michael Raines.
he's the detective working the case.
is grace here? - In my office.
Mr. Tobman, please - uh, detective?
before we called the Strongs, we were pretty angry with Grace, there was a lot of yelling...
you haven't told Grace yet.
we didn't want, on the heels of all that - of course.
grace, this is detective Raines.
uh, Grace?
try a little less big and scary.
Yeah.
grace, um, just need to talk to you a little bit.
I need to know what happened.
yeah?
it's okay, baby.
we wanted to go to the ballet store.
ballet store?
Oh, the one next to the Paddle Tennis Courts?
and walk on the boardwalk.
she loves the boardwalk.
I like the boardwalk too.
um, so you were on the boardwalk with Emily?
we were watching one of the performers.
but then, Emily wasn't there and I thought she'd gone home so...
so I did too.
did something bad happen to Emily?
detective?
uh, Grace, what were you watching when, uh, Emily disappeared?
thank you, thank you. Thank you
Hey, don't forget, man, do not try this at home.
I used to be a white dude.
wow, $20, man, thanks.
so what can I do for you, detective?
uh, does she look familiar?
is that the little girl they found in the kids' playground?
Yeah, her friend said she was here at your show today.
might have been 2: 00, 2:30?
we think she might have been assaulted.
in my show?
you mean someone was messing with her at my show?
well, that sicko's been back again, you know?
Oh, that guy that you, uh, ided last year?
Yeah, that scrawny little bastard.
the one who was messing with kids at my show, feeling them up.
he's been hanging around again?
Yeah. I saw him last week.
I mean, I would've chased after him, but I was juggling four torches and a bowling ball, you know?
been there.
what was his name? Do you remember?
I don't know, but I'm pretty sure you guys got it down.
Yeah, I'll bet.
Tony, thank you, baby. - Well, thank you, man.
just try to go easy on the sauce.
Oh, I will. Thanks for the $20, detective. I'll pay you back, man.
you will not. - I'm serious, man. I'll pay you back, man.
I love you, Tony Vera. - I love you more.
I'll pay you back every dime. Every dime, man.
what's this?
it's the coroner's report, and the original Tony Vera complaint.
the cops couldn't substantiate Tony's claim at the time, but Charlie Newman, the guy he ided?
he had a prior for solicitation of a minor, so we're bringing him in.
we got a rap sheet on Mr. Newman? - Yeah.
you know, I can head over to the Strongs, finish up the interview, if you're stuck here.
really, what did you put on your wheaties this morning?
nothing. Just doing my job.
Yeah, that's what's so surprising.
this vaginal bruising pretty much confirms sexual assault.
and they think they may get a DNA sample off the pubic hair, but, I mean, she didn't have any, - so they figure the guy - listen, I can read.
sexual assault, that's like rape?
why would someone do that?
I'm ten years old.
why would god let someone do that?
we got the guy from the Vera complaint in interrogation.
you need a minute?
Yeah, thanks. Yeah.
detective? You didn't answer my question.
are we ever gonna talk about what happened to me?
sure.
no, we're not.
you're a ten-year-old figment of my imagination.
so it's difficult?
difficult, very difficult.
detective, I don't exist. You just said to yourself.
that's right.
so it's not me you're avoiding.
why can't you face this?
Because!
when you asked me two minutes ago why somebody would rape and murder a ten-year-old girl, that was me asking.
don't you get that?
and because I don't know why somebody would do that to you.
I don't know why god would let somebody do that to you.
and because...
because you don't know if you can do this anymore.
did you wonder about that when you had the other victims in your head?
absolutely, sure.
you know you didn't.
okay, little miss wisey pants, no, I didn't.
I didn't, 'cause they were older.
you know my partner, Charlie?
Yeah, it sad and it's tragic that he's dead, that his son Jack is gonna grow up without a father.
but at least he lived long enough to have a son.
and you? All you had was an American girl doll.
that's sad. - Well sure, sweetie, isn't it?
the other victims.
they helped you solve their cases.
detective, how can I help you?
unless you read a Nancy Drew mystery where she solves a child rape murder, I don't think you can.
here, here's how you can help me.
I'm about to go in and interrogate a possible suspect, a convicted pedophile.
what's a pedophile?
like that. Don't-- don't-- that's what I can't have you do.
when I go in there, I can't have you be asking questions and interfering with my interrogation.
I gotta focus.
so could you stay out here while I'm there?
that's how you can help.
it's your head, detective.
just stop thinking about me.
if you haven't noticed, I don't exactly have complete control over my delightful imagination.
you should talk to someone about that.
Yeah, thank you.
could you do that, please? I'm asking nicely.
okay.
thank you. - On one condition.
ultimatums?
when we're done with my case, we'll play the song I was learning.
you know how I feel about that song.
I'll teach you one note samba.
detective! - Yeah?
you ready? - Here I come.
well hello, Mr. Charlie Newman.
Mr. Charles Newman, I'm detective Raines.
thank you very, very much for coming in.
are you nervous about something?
no.
cause really, Charlie-- can I call you Charlie?
man, there's nothing to be nervous about.
everybody's got a thing, you know?
I can sympathize.
Hey, I like...
I like younger women.
maybe not quite as young as you, but, you know, 19, 18.
French.
you know, a one piece. Preferably a nice riviera tan.
and sure, there are people, Charlie, I don't know them personally, but I'm told there are people who think that...
I'm too old?
that it's disgusting.
can you imagine?
are you with me? But you know what I say?
I say screw 'em.
screw them and their, frankly, uh, bourgeois sensibility.
their protestant moral code.
that's what I say.
how about you, Charlie? What do you say?
I say I'm tired of getting hauled in here every time a little girl is molested.
did I mention that a little girl was molested?
no, but every time one is, you pull my name up on the database and you bring me in.
Charlie, that's what you get for molesting little girls.
she was standing on a street corner.
she looked like she was 22.
I make one mistake, and I'm marked for life.
and thanks to that damn Megan's law, it's out there for all the world to see.
do you know how many times I've had to move because of uptight landlords and crazy vigilantes?
welcome to Los Angeles.
over here.
thank you very much for staying out here.
I was just trying to help.
I lied before.
when I was your age, the hardy boys, I was really into it.
I read every single one, then one day I got kind of curious about the girl detective, so I read Nancy Drew.
and I liked it very much.
I know.
do you think he did it?
Charlie Newman?
well we're checking out his alibi, but no history of violence, no prior contact with you...
detective, we don't have any other leads.
no, we don't.
what if we don't find him?
what if we don't find the guy who did this to me?
Hey. - Hey.
how's the investigation?
Oh, the investigation is swell.
no witnesses, nothing from the scene, no prints on the duffel.
it was canvas?
Mm-hmm, and the Tobman lead, dead end.
how about the emails?
one of the addresses in her address book was bounced off another site, raised a red flag with the ISP.
which means? - I have no idea.
lance is tracking that down?
okay.
all right.
tomorrow morning, I want to go public with the fact that she was assaulted.
Oh.
hang on, we haven't canvassed the neighbors, talked to her teachers
Yeah, but you know what? I've have half the city breathing down my neck.
we're working off a database of what, 500 recent offenders?
if there's a nervous witness out there...
yay, collect calls from half the nuts in venice.
it's gonna be like our very own red carpet show for the megalomaniacally insane.
Michael. - Its gonna traumatize the family.
which is why you'll run it by them first.
I'd be happy to send Lance.
or Boyer.
ca Sex Offender Database how do you protect them?
how do you...?
God. I mean, we could have moved.
where?
she loved the beach. We all did.
I mean, what was I supposed to do?
you alarm the house.
check on her at night. You hold her hand.
and one day, she decides she's old enough to walk to school alone.
I mean, it's only five blocks, and so you think about it, you say no.
and then after six months of crying, and carrying on and drama, you say yes.
you say yes.
all the time, you have no idea that this is living all around you.
you've confirmed it, haven't you?
she was molested.
we think it would be best for the investigation if we told the public.
excuse me?
Yeah, often, um, if the public hears that a young child has been, uh,
...harmed in this way, they react strongly. Helpfully.
reluctant witnesses become less reluctant.
I haven't told Judy yet.
let me tell Judy.
we have to find him.
maybe you should take a break.
Why?
we could play the song.
Ugh, we haven't solved the case yet.
and, uh, I don't think my neighbors would appreciate being serenaded at this hour.
can I play?
they won't hear me. - I will.
these are cool.
thank you.
you have a lot of toys.
do you think it's because you didn't have any as a kid?
isn't it past your bedtime?
isn't it past your bedtime?
why don't you have any kids?
cause they irritate me.
cause I didn't have time.
cause I didn't wanna, uh, lose another argument with my ex-wife.
seeing me makes you regret not having kids, doesn't it?
there were 800, 000 kids kidnapped in the U. S.Last year.
sure, only 50 were killed, but that's still one a week.
and all those parents' lives, they're ruined and destroyed.
because the thing they love most in the world is gone forever.
or so I imagine.
you know, even my wonderful imagination has limits.
what your parents are going through now...
I-- I--I don't know.
I don't know.
it's a dark gray ocean whose depths I'm never gonna know.
don't really wanna know. So...
seeing you?
frankly, kinda--kinda makes me glad that I've never had kids.
okay then.
okay then.
LAPD homicide hotline, detective Boyer speaking.
no, she didn't have a nose ring. She's ten.
remember, service with a smile.
homicide hotline.
good morning. - Is it?
you know some people like to start the day with some breakfast, some coffee, sleep...
we've got two convicted sex offenders living a block away from the Strongs?
Yeah, one's back in jail, the other has an alibi, but you know, it's shaky, I'm looking into it.
what about the bounced email address?
belongs to Gary Marsh, Emily's teacher.
a 4th grade teacher emailing a student?
boyer said they were general assignments, apparently he cced the entire class.
I can go grab them...
of course, Mrs. Strong, but I wouldn't jump to any...
I'm sorry, could you hang on a second?
it's Judy Strong, she's been up all night poring over the Megan's law site.
there's a handyman who worked at their house a few months ago.
what's his name?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Strong, what's...
she says his name is Charlie Newman.
Mr. Newman? Charlie?
damn Megan's law.
there's nothing at the back exit.
you want me to cordon off the floor and set up a security log?
hi there, little girl.
I never did catch your name.
detective? You--you want...?
I just got a new puppy back at my house. You wanna go see him?
detective?
I'm scared.
it's right this way.
leave me alone! Leave me alone!
come on. It's right down the hall.
no. - Come on, sweetheart. Come on.
you sure I shouldn't - I want everyone out until S. I.D - leave me alone! - no, no, no.
come on, sweetheart. Come on, sweetheart.
come on. - Leave me alone.
detective? - Come on!
I don't want to.
it's a little puppy.
little yellow puppy.
detective? - You're gonna like him.
I'm not gonna hurt you!
listen to me. I need you and everybody else to get out of the buil
Thanks, detective.
detective?
wait for S. I.D.
you're just gonna let her do that to me.
Yeah.
well, I guess that figures.
you know, between the Megan's law website and the newsflash that poor,
...sweet Emily was molested, you might as well just stuck a bull's-eye on my back.
you're not talking to me? Well, fine. Fine.
you know what? Just another innocent man, condemned to die at the hands of an overzealous constabulary.
you know what, next time, why don't you just hand out pitchforks
and torches to every idiot with a batman complex and nice shot.
daddy never let me play with guns.
don't listen to Newman.
he so got what he deserved.
you know he did it.
what he knows is that recidivism rates for sex offenders is dramatically overstated,
...that only 13% repeat, and that all the evidence that he has is circumstantial.
not to mention the fact that you lived down the block from a convicted sex offender, who, from what I hear, has a rather shaky alibi.
they'll run a DNA test, prove it was you.
they'll run a DNA test, prove it was you.
where are we going?
come on now, you're a bright girl.
who do you think did this to me?
you have anything for me, detective?
sorry, Betty, you know I try not to feed the animals.
he didn't do it!
just because he was upset, doesn't mean that he...
please. Please.
where is he, Judy?
and she had no idea where he was?
no, sir.
all right.
let's put out a warrant and want on Mr. Strong. - okay.
Carolyn, keep it away from the press.
and see if you can get the deputy chief on the line.
are you okay?
dandy.
my daddy didn't do anything wrong!
Really? Because you don't look so hot.
why can't you leave him alone?
don't listen to her. She's just a child.
you want some aspirin?
think that'll do the trick?
Michael, you did your job, you found her killer.
well, still we don't know that.
no, we do know that.
we just got a DNA match off the hair at the crime scene.
like that proves anything.
I could have an identical brother. Or sister.
my point is, I can put somebody else on the case.
you don't have to finish this.
no, I do.
I have to. It's my job.
didn't my daddy do your job for you?
what...
Henry did was wrong.
sometimes justice, what we think of as justice, it has to take a back seat to law and order.
what's up?
Hey, we've got a 5150 matching Henry Strong's description.
he's at the Hollywood Zoo.
at the zoo? Why would he be at the zoo?
one of her teacher's online assignments.
her winter break essay?
my birthday was over break so...
my daddy and I did what we always do on my birthday...
we went to the zoo to visit the lions.
isn't it strange?
even though I'm almost all grown up, I still love the lions.
all right. Get over there.
we're gonna go lock him up and throw away the key.
please. Tell everyone to turn around.
sometimes justice has to take a back seat to law and order. Right, detective?
please. Just turn around.
don't worry, nobody's gonna hurt your dad.
Hey, hey, hey! Hands off.
Hey, she's the one that keeps shooting me. - Stay away from her.
if I have to stop this car - he deserves it!
Raines. - Detective Raines, this is Dr. Kohl.
Oh, no--not a good time.
see? You should turn around and go to therapy.
I'm a dealing with a double homicide here.
we had an appointment at noon.
he doesn't need therapy, he needs to arrest your father. - If you're going to miss an appointment you need to shut up! Shut
detective?
sorry, that was-- I'm working two phones here.
look, I've got to go arrest somebody for killing the guy who murdered his daughter.
I don't have time to be scheduling therapy appointments, doctor.
look, I've got some time this evening.
maybe you, uh...maybe you wanna stop by.
Uh...yeah-- yeah, I gotta go.
what's going on?
they made a positive id on the guy. It's Mr. Strong.
is he okay?
he's got a gun. He's threatening to kill himself.
stay back.
just wanna-- just wanna see you.
do you have a gun?
what am I gonna do, shoot you?
no.
Oh, Henry.
I wish you hadn't, uh, killed him.
you don't think he deserved to die?
Well...sure.
Hey, if I were you, I probably would've killed him myself.
but look where it's brought you.
she used to be afraid of them, you know.
when she was little.
she wouldn't go near the fence.
she'd make me stand a good ten feet away.
a jury is gonna have a lot of sympathy for your story.
I don't want sympathy, I want my daughter back.
are you thinking of killing yourself?
it's better that way.
it's easier. - Oh! For who?
Judy?
and how about Emily?
what about her?
can you see her?
what?
imagine.
right here. Right now. Right next to you.
you can even close your eyes.
do you see her?
I can.
she's such a beautiful girl.
so full of life.
you can kinda-- kinda see her, can't you?
that beautiful girl lives in you, Henry.
and if you're not here to talk about her, and remember her, and share her stories...
Henry, if you kill yourself, she'll die all over again.
take it easy, take it easy.
Yeah, Henry, I'll put it in your pocket.
I know everybody's wondering why I've been busting my ass.
you saw the girl in that duffel.
first thing, all I could think about was how much I hate this job.
and then I realized, no...
that's why you took the job.
Yeah, he's right, you know. Boyer.
a case like this one, it's the reason I hate being a cop.
it's also the reason I am one.
well, that's the hour.
I thought we just got started.
Yeah. How would next Thursday at 3: 30 be?
Oh. No, I'm serious. What do we have, eight more hours?
you know, I've got stuff to do tonight, but I'm just down the block, if you don't mind watching me exfoliate...
3: 30 next Thursday.
Yeah. Okay. Got me gabbing there.
detective? - Yeah.
when we talked earlier today, you said you couldn't get the little girl out of your head.
did you see her?
I'm sorry, what?
did you actually see her?
you said that you talk to the victims.
do you see them as well?
no. I don't.
okay.
bourbon on a Tuesday night?
better than Tuesday morning.
why are you still here?
I want you to play the song. - No.
please?
maybe you should have that drink.
look, I'm sorry about your dad.
it's okay. Really.
I know you had to do it.
that it was the right thing.
then why haven't you left yet?
it isn't just the song...
because I think you should talk to that doctor lady some more and tell her the truth.
you do, huh?
I could lose my job.
so?
it's all I've got, honey.
I think if you don't talk to her, you're gonna lose it anyway.
I think you should mind - I'm ten. I don't say beeswax anymore.
if I play it, will you go?
do you know him?
John!
John!
do you know where John is?
over there
John
John Rambo
I don't believe this
so where did you come from?
washington
good to see you again
Yeah, you too
you want to... uh... tell me about it?
about what?
how yesterday I see you stick fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok
you saw that?
yeah
today I find you working in a monastery
they let me live here and I help out fixing things
and the stick fighting?
I do that for a little extra money
Yeah. I saw you give it to the monks
you see a lot
Colonel
who are they?
they're partly the reason I'm here
Bob
this is Robert Griggs
he's a field officer with local embassy
John Rambo
pleasure
you're certainly not easy to find
why are you keeping track?
like the Colonel says
good men are hard to find
John
I'd like you to look at these photos
I don't know how much you know about Afghanistan
most people can't find it on a map
but over two million civilians, mostly peasant farmers and their families have been systematically slaughtered by invading Russian armies
every new weapon including chemical warfare has been used to eliminate these people
they've been very successful on many levels
I assume you're out of touch with the current status of the war
after nine year of fighting,
afghan forces are getting shipment of stinger missiles
they're beginning to hold their own against air strikes
except for one region 50 miles over the border
the Soviet commander there is exceptionally brutal
as those photos indicate
he's managed to strangle off all aid from the outside
so, we want to investigate the problem first hand
what does that has got to do with me?
they've asked me to go in
you're not doing it?
Yes. And I want you to come with me, John
I put in my time
what does that mean?
it means my war is over
I thought you said he was this great soldier
Colonel
looks like we got a long walk down those stairs
don't be down on him
he's just following orders
this mission's important, John
do you really think we'll make a difference?
if I didn't, I wouldn't be going
it didn't before
that was another time
come with me, John
I don't know what you think about this place
but I like it
I like being here
I like working here
I like belonging to something
you do belong to something
not this
when will you come full circle?
what are you talking about?
you said your war is over
maybe the one out there is
but not the one inside you
I know the reasons you're here, John
but it doesn't work that way
you may try, but you can't get away what you really are
what do you think that?
a full-blooded combat soldier
not anymore. I don't want it
that's too bad because you're stuck with it
let me tell you a story, John
a sculptor found a stone, a special stone
he dragged it home, worked on it for months, until he finally finished it
his friends said he'd created a great statue
the sculptor said he hadn't created anything
the statue was always there
he just cleared away the small pieces
we didn't' make you to this fighting machine
we just chipped away the rough edges
you're always be going to be tearing away at yourself until you come to terms with what you are
until you come full circle
I guess I'm not ready yet
well. I got to move
promise me. You'll look me up, when you get stateside, huh?
I promise
Colonel
I'm sorry
but it's got to the end for me some time
I understand
take cover!
drop your weapons!
and remain where you are
you cannot escape!
we will not attack if you do not run!
drop your weapons!
you have no chance to escape!
drop your weapons!
now!
Rambo
something went wrong
what happened?
Soviets intercepted the team just over the border
from what we get it,
trautman and the rest of his party have been taken to a regional command post
what are you doing about it?
we can't do anything about it
I'm sorry
I just thought you should know
what about me?
what about you?
can you get me in?
you're not serious？
Oh, yeah. I'm serious
it can't be done official
make it unofficially
if you give it done, I want you to know up front that if you're captured or if any of this leaks, we'll deny any participation or even knowledge of your existence
I'm used to it
I'll get back to you
peshawar, Pakistan near the Afghan Border
you want to buy?
many guns here
no
I'm looking for Mousa Gani
what's your name?
John Rambo
wait here
they sell many in Afghanistan
many land mines
land mines everywhere
I am Mousa Gani
what is it you want?
I was sent by Griggs
you do not look like men Griggs sent before
you do not look like you are with military
I'm not
who you are?
a mercenary?
no
you're not military or mercenary. Who are you?
lost tourist?
I'm no tourist
sorry
do you know where the American is?
yes
in Soviet fort
near the village of Khowst 30 miles over border
mr Griggs sent you supplies you asked for
you wish to see them now?
yeah
is this that you asked for?
yeah
I never see this before. What are these?
detonators
and this?
what is this for?
it's a blue light
what does it do?
turns blue
I see
can you tell me how many more men come with us?
there's no rescue team It's just me
just you?
come on, this is no good
I cannot take only one man to the fort
you needed more men to help
Griggs said you'd take me in
take me in
I need to take medical supplies
if I not take it, many people will die
do you understand?
Rambo, I do not know who you really are
but by the way you look,
I can see you have no experience in war, do you?
come on, do you?
I've fired a few shots
a few shots?
come on
maybe you should go back home
and think it all over again for a very long time
I did think it over
you did?
well. This is your choice
but let me tell you
you cannot get this American alone
if you fail, do not blame me
I will accept no responsibility
that sounds familiar
my name is Colonel Zaysen, the Regional Commander of this sector
do you realize, you're the first American captured in Afghanistan?
Congratulations!
I believe you are planning to supply enemy rebel forces with stinger missiles intended to destroy Soviet aircraft
if I'm going to be interrogated,
I want to be interrogated by your superiors
out here, I have no superiors
I am in full command
you are alone here
abandoned by your government
what do you want?
cooperation
this sector has been under total control for over five years
there is little more I can do here
it is as you say
without challenges
if you supply to me worthy information about more stinger missiles you are planning to deliver it could provide a way out of this for us both
after all, in the end, what everyone really wants is peace
the Kremlin's got a sense of humor
please explain
you talk peace and disarmament to the world
and here you are wiping out a race of people
we are wiping out no one
I think you are too intelligent to believe such absurd propaganda
now again, where are the missiles?
I don't know anything about any missiles
of course you do
but you don't seem to realize
I'm providing a way out for us both
you expect sympathy?
you started this damn war!
now you have to deal with it!
and we will
it's just a matter of time before we achieve a complete victory
there won't be a victory!
every day your war machines lose ground to poorly armed, poorly equipped freedom fighters
the fact is you underestimated your competition
if you studied the history, you will know these people have never given up to anyone
they'd rather die, than be slaves to an invading army
you can't defeat a people like that
we tried
we already had our Vietnam
now you're going to have yours
so, you wish to test me!
good
this is Afghanistan
alexander The Great tried to conquer this country
then Genghis Khan, then the British
now Russia
but Afghan people fight hard
they'll never be defeated
ancient enemy make prayer about these people
you wish to hear?
very good. It says:
may God deliver us from the venom of the cobra
teeth of the tiger
and the vengeance of the Afghan
you understand what this means?
that you guys don't take any shit?
Yes. Something like this
we go now
to the north, there are many caves
we will travel through them
it'll be safer
we go
these caves lead us to the valley of five lions
in ancient days, the Afghan king was asked to send 500 warriors into battle
he said: Only five
his greatest five and they won
he said: It's better to send five lions than 500 sheep
what do you think of this?
the king was lucky
lucky?
how much longer to the village?
about two hours
where in my sector are the missiles being delivered?
I don't know
you're a liar
where?
where?
all right. I tell you
I knew you were lying
now, where are the missiles located?
close
how close?
in your ass
you've tried my patience long enough
I tried to be civilized
the name of John Rambo
do you know it?
no
he says there are plans for a rescue attempt with the help of some rebels
he also says he knows where this man is going
we will welcome him
it's the last village in the valley
about 100 men here
they have a lot of kids here
Yes. And they are good fighters, too
I tell the leaders, we want to talk
they never see man look like you
these are Mujahedeen horsemen 10000 horsemen more are waiting at the border to get weapons
when they get it, they come back here to fight
let's go to the hospital
he's the only doctor for 500 kilometers
the first medicine they get in two months
more gifts from the Soviets
they look like toys, but they are mines
we teach children not to touch
some learn too late
who's that?
his name is Uri
he's Russian
deserter?
he call himself a defector
there are many like him
he's the one who can help the most
he knows the inside of the fort
I think we should go now
mine starts here
at 1 meter like this
then go 2 meters like this and like this
they have four towers
four guards
here, here, here and here
where do they keep the prisoners?
here
if we get in there, is there another way out?
underground, where is all bad water
I do not know words for this place
he means sewer
where is it?
here
outside, it goes there
guards patrol there
I do not think you go this way
we should go through the mine fields
they will not expect it
this cannot be done
there are many spetnaz commandos
we are only these
we have lost many men
we lose many more if we go there
I don't need many men
what is it that you want to do?
I need two men to get me into the mine field
and two to help me to escape
if this is done, Soviets will come here like before
and more people will die
I can't wait
you must wait for help, the way we wait
then I'll go alone
and you will die
then I die
wait!
please don't go!
my name is Masoud
you must not judge us, before you understand why we are not ready to help
most of the Afghan people are very strong
and we are determined not to be driven from our land
our children die of disease, mines and poison gas
and the women are raped and killed
last year, in the valley of Laghman, the next valley 6000 Afghans were killed
pregnant women were cut with bayonets and their babies thrown into the fires
this is done, so they will not have the next generation of Afghans
yet nobody sees anything or reads anything in the papers
what you see here are the Mujahedeens soldiers
holy warriors
to us, this war is a Holy war
and there's no true death for a Mujahedeen because we have taken our last rites
we consider ourselves dead already
to us, death for our land and God is an honor
so, my friend
what we must do is to stop this killing of our women and children
if getting this man free, so he can return to the free world and tell what happens here is necessary then of course, we will help
leave us now
so we may speak among ourselves and find the best way to free this man
thank you
we thank you
don't worry They will decide soon
got to get in tonight
what is your name?
this boy is very hard inside
his parents were killed last year
his brother died in the fort where the American is
he looks like a boy, but he fights like a man
what is your name?
Rambo

I need luck

look what a child, always like this
look there, it's a national sport
old insane game
maybe 3000 years old
they never stop playing it
war, not war, they don't mind
you like it?
I'll take football
football?
what's football? You play with your foot?
not really
come on. Come on. Let's go
Hey, American!
what are they saying?
they want you to try
it's a way to welcome you to go with them
if you want to try, go ahead. But I'm not responsible for it
I'll try
yes?
what are the rules?
well, you have to take the sheep once a round and throw it in the circle
Why?
because there is a circle there
that's it?
that's it. Very simple
like football
God must love crazy people
Why?
he makes so many of them
take cover! Take cover!
move! Move! Move!
now you see, how it is here
somewhere in war, there's supposed to be honor
where is the honor here? Where?
we are taking the survivors to the border
are you coming?
I'm going to the fort
have you not seen enough death?
go, go while you can
this is not your war
it is now
so be it
you are a good friend
I stay. I will show you the way
I will go, too
no. You go with them
I will not
they kill all my family. I want to fight
not with me
you go
come on
why must you do this?
because he'd do it for me
have you decided to talk?
no?
very well
soon you will be my guest down the hall
come on
go back!
No!
go back!
go on
stay here. Stay back
I know this place
you need me
I don't need you dead

Colonel? Colonel?
John, how the hell did you get in here?
can you move?
you're damn right, I can
let's go
John, behind you!

John! Get out! Get the hell out of here!
come on!
help me!
take him
come on!
give me the boy
Hurry!
come on!
OK
take the kid
get down!
give me the boy
who is the terrorist?
what makes you so valuable to him?
this bastard tried to destroy me tonight
but he failed!
at sunrise, I'll hunt him down and have his skin hang on the wall!
you don't have to hunt him
what?
he'll find you
are you insane?
one man against thirty commandos?
who do you think this man is? God?
no. God would have mercy. He won't
it's alright, nobody's here
all right. This will hold a while
what's the fastest way out of here?
northwest
there is trail between mountains about 2 kilometers from here
the trail is very difficult
you take the boy and go
I want to stay
you can't
you cannot go back there
we must all go to Pakistan
I've got to go back
I know he's your friend, but you cannot do this
you both will die, for what?
come with us
just do what I say
let me have your gun
alright, let's go
come on
can I see you again?
sure
Jesus!
come on, move!
come on!
can you fly that thing?
let's find out
let's go!
Hurry! Hurry!
get on board!
hold on!
over there!
there!
hold on!
get up!
take my hand!
we're going down!
hold on!
get out of here!
it's going to blow!
take what you can, John!
come on! Move it! Move it!
come on!
we've got to get to the border
we'll stay here
we know where to go
which direction, John?
northeast
hold it, John
I've got to rest a minute
you taught us to ignore pain, didn't you?
is it working?
not really
don't take it personally
thanks
you go on ahead and see if you can get a cover
OK!
John!
John!
that was close, John, how are you?
well-done
we don't want to make it easy for him
we better split up
I'm sorry I got you into this
no, you're not
are you listening?
who are you?
your worst nightmare
that's good timing
what are friends for?
you get back to the hole
I'll cover you and see if there's anyone left
John!
across the valley is the border
we did it, John
yeah
wait
what the hell is that?
the son of a bitch
do not try to retreat
you cannot escape
we won't attack if you do not run
we don't want to hurt you
somehow I don't believe him
I order you to come forward
you will receive a fair trial
drop you weapons
and remain where you are
you got any ideas?
drop your weapons
surrounding them
hell of a time for humor, John
drop the weapons. Now!
you have no chance to escape!
come forward
I wish to take you back alive
this is your last warning
the choice is yours
what do you say?
fuck them!
if we're going, I wish we'd taken that bastard with us
what is that?
it's the rebels
come on!
John, get out of there!
John!
you sure you don't want to stay?
you fight good for a tourist
maybe next time
you want this back?
no. You keep it
can you stay?
I've got to go
goodbye
hard to believe, John
what's that, sir?
I hate to admit it, but the truth is,
I think we're getting soft
maybe just a little, sir
just a little
this film is dedicated to the Gallant people of Afghanistan
but there's a gentleman here asking for you.
he says he's Mr. Charles. Charles.
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheldon. That's what he says.
the butler says he'll come straight down, sir.
step inside, sir.
take a seat, sir.
you'll excuse me taking precautions, sir, it being late and all.
it's quite all right.
is Miss Bridget at home, do you know?
Yes, sir. The whole family's at home.
Really? Everything's all right up at the house, I hope.
haven't you heard, sir? Old Mr. Rainier died Sunday.
the funeral was today, sir.
was he a relative of yours, sir?
he was my father.
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't feel much like eating, but still. I must say I think it most peculiar.
after three years of complete silence...
he suddenly comes back from the grave with this cock-and-bull story...
...and at the very moment when the will is to be read.
very convenient, if you ask me.
you talk as if my brother were a fraud. -Who's to say he isn't?
you seem to forget Sheldon's seen him. -Yes, in the dark...
and Sheldon was probably half-asleep.
isn't this argument rather a waste of time?
we shall see him for ourselves in a moment...
...and with all respect to Lydia...
I think we shall be able to recognize our own brother.
morning, everybody. -Good morning.
morning, Mother. -Morning, darling.
Where's Uncle Charles?
he's not down yet. Besides, we're not all deaf, dear.
I'm sorry. I'm just dying to see him. It's all so romantic...
like a thriller in the railway bookstore...
back From The Dead or The Disappearing Uncle.
Yes, or Three Years In Darkest Amnesia.
three years! Think of it.
where do you suppose he's been all that time?
that's just what I've been asking. In jail, for all we know.
did Truslove say positively that the will was written 10 years ago?
Yes, and I gather the estate is divided equally between all of us...
...with the exception of the two business interests...
which, naturally, fall to me. -Naturally.
and this house, which goes to Charles. -To Charles?
but why on earth should Charles get the house?
that gives him more than Chet, the eldest son.
morning, Uncle George. -Morning, Kitty. Morning, everybody.
morning. -I say, have you heard the news?
plenty for all and plenty more...
...when up-to-date methods are used in the handling of our various interests.
in fact, without being unduly optimistic, I think I may say...
sausages, by Jove!
but if the whole matter's gonna be treated as a joke
sit down, Chet. It's no joke to me.
that is, supposing it really is Charles who's suddenly turned up like a...
like a bad penny?
Hello, my dear fellow. How are you?
Hello, Chet. How are you? -Delighted to see you, Charles.
welcome home, darling. -Hello, darling.
Charles, this is jolly. -My dear.
Charles, dear, how nice to see you.
you haven't met Henry yet, have you?
a new brother-in-law? How do you do? Congratulations.
thank you very much. -You remember Lydia.
how are you? -How are you?
Hello, old chap. -I'm Kitty.
Jill had to take me when she took Daddy.
how do you do, Kitty? Please sit down, all of you.
I'm afraid I'm upsetting your breakfast. -Here's a chair. Next to mine.
what can I get you? -You go on with your breakfast...
and I'll forage for myself. -Go ahead, my dear chap.
we're all absolutely delighted to see you back.
have to kill the fatted calf, what?
I'll settle for a couple of George's sausages.
if he's left any. -Plenty. I'm on a diet.
by Jove, he's kidding. Amazing. -They sound absolutely deafening.
by the way, my dear fellow, Truslove's reading the will this morning.
it's 10 years old, so you won't be done out of your share...
...which includes the house, I understand. -Really?
I'm sure you're all waiting for some sort of explanation.
I really haven't got one. That's what loss of memory does for you.
Sheldon's told you all I know.
I was in Liverpool yesterday morning.
why or how, I've no idea.
I'd been knocked down by a taxi and came to in a chemist's shop.
before that, I can't remember a thing.
since a shell hole in France, and that was three years ago.
those three years are a complete blank to me.
I don't know what I've done, where I've been.
I found a little money in my pocket and this key.
the key to your house?
if I knew that, I'd know where I belong.
you belong here, Uncle Charles. -Yes?
Yes, of course. This house.
I hope you'll all still think of it as home and come whenever you like...
and stay as long as you care to, now or anytime.
Charles-- -I shall come. Often.
I'm terribly glad you're my uncle. -Thank you, Kitty.
goodbye. -Goodbye, sir.
sorry you're leaving. -Well, Charles.
take care, old chap, won't you? Excuse my left hand.
Hello, Uncle Charles! I've come to say goodbye!
Hello, Kitty. You off, Julian? -Yes.
I don't think I shall call you uncle. You're not really my uncle.
forward minx. Goodbye, Charles. Let's meet again sometime, somewhere.
we must.
goodbye, young woman. -Goodbye.
let's sit down, shall we? Come on.
mother will be hours yet. She's always late.
can I have a puff of that cigarette?
do you think you should?
all the girls at Kerwood smoke as soon as they're in sixth.
you don't mind, do you? -Why should l?
Charles, aren't you going to be...
..terribly lonely all by yourself in this big house?
perhaps. Why?
only when people are lonely...
...they're rather apt to marry the first woman who comes along.
it doesn't do, you know.
it doesn't? - Never.
not once, in all your years of experience?
I shall be 18 in three years.
I'll keep you in mind. -Will you?
I know you're laughing at me...
but please don't do anything rash in the meantime...
because I do like you awfully, from the very first moment.
is this a leap year, by any chance?
I don't know, and I don't care.
I've said it and I mean it. -I'll have to think it over.
anyway, don't you think that I might come here in the holidays...
...and sort of take care of you?
what would Mother say? -Jill? She wouldn't mind.
she loves to get rid of me. -Kitty!
you'll write to me, won't you?
Kitty! -Will you?
all right, if you want me to.
here I am, waiting.
goodbye, Charles. Goodbye, Sheldon.
I've simply got to fly. -Goodbye, my dear.
lovely to see you. Come along, Kitty! -Goodbye.
goodbye, Kitty. -Goodbye, Uncle Charles.
thanks for asking me to come and visit you in the holidays.
will you be dining at home, sir? -Yes, I suppose so.
alone, sir? -There's no one else, is there?
I thought perhaps you might like to ask the vicar or Dr. Hampstead.
I don't think so, Sheldon. Thank you.
I'm afraid you'll be very lonely in this great house.
may one ask, sir, have you any plans for the future?
no. I might go back to Cambridge.
I never got my degree.
I might take a fling at writing. I always wanted to, if you remember.
I wonder what he would have liked me to do.
I think he always wanted you to carry on at Rainier's where he left off, sir.
but Mr. Chetwynd is head of Rainier's now.
Yes, now, sir, but... We shall see.
in any case, I'm not a businessman.
have you ever tried, sir? -No.
I wonder what I was doing in Liverpool.
dear Uncle Charles...
or "Dear Charles" .
what do you think?
he's not really my uncle, you know, and I have intentions.
dear Charles, so you've left Cambridge and gone into the business.
what a shame. I know you hated to leave your books...
...and that quiet corner of the river where Rupert Brooke used to dream.
mother says you're simply a wizard at it. We're all going to be rich again.
write to me soon.
l keep all your letters.
sentimental little college girl.
dear Uncle Charles.
dear Charles, I've graduated with honors.
I'm sending you my photograph in cap and gown.
will you put me on the desk in your study?
and please, look at me sometimes.
dear Charles... My dear Charles...
just to remind you that I'm growing up.
l have lots of beaus.
l do hope you're jealous.
by the way, I saw your picture in the paper.
l was impressed.
industrial Prince of England...
Mr. Charles Rainier.'
Hello, nuisance.
my word.
do you like it?
my dear, you look adorable.
adore me. I can bear it.
haven't I seen that hat before? -It's not a bad hat, is it?
it's a lovely hat.
now it will be a lovely lunch.
my dear, I cannot possibly afford the time. Come on.
Yes, you can. Miss Hanson says so.
she says it will do you good to get out of this office...
for an hour or two.
or two?
miss Hanson. -Yes, Mr. Rainier.
owing to lamentable weakness of character...
I'm having lunch at the Savoy with your approval.
I thoroughly approve. -You do.
I do, Mr. Rainier.
will you get me a copy...
...of the Brown-Severing prospectus while I'm out?
Yes, I will. -Have I any appointments for 2: 00?
Yes. -Can you postpone them?
Yes, I can. -Thanks.
all right, young woman...
I can give you precisely one hour and a half from door to door.
no. Miss Hanson said two hours.
thank you.
cigarette? -Please.
you're being very charming today. You haven't looked at your watch once.
that reminds me. -No, please. Can't you relax for an hour?
an hour? It's just on 3: 00.
you used to say that you hated business. -Did l?
you know you did.
you were going to whip things into shape and get out quickly.
that was the original idea.
to save the family and then be off before they needed more saving.
in that slow and careful way of yours? - I began to look into things, yes.
I found that Rainier's kept other families going, too.
little families in little homes. Thousands of them, all over England.
I see. Uncle Atlas, eh?
don't you ever want to get out and have fun?
Kitty, the last time l...
it's that woman you sent me, Lady Maxton.
one of the most interesting cases I've had...
since I have been in private practice.
well, goodbye.
goodbye, Lola, and don't forget that you're dining with me on Thursday.
goodbye.
what is it?
pardon me. It was nothing. It was just for a moment, that voice
was familiar? -Not that, exactly...
but it seemed to remind me of something that I didn't have time to get a grip on.
that happens to me sometimes.
a sort of wisp of memory that can't be caught before it fades away.
from those lost years? -Perhaps.
now, what were you saying?
that you should take a holiday. You've got money enough, heaven knows.
money, yes, but not the time. -That's nonsense.
you could make the time. How old are you?
none of your business.
you're awfully nice-looking, Charles. -Thank you.
clever, interesting.
it's not fair.
Why?
because you've spoiled me for other men, that's why.
Kitty.
it's no secret, is it? I've always been mad about you...
even as a schoolgirl.
it might be fun if you loved me now.
we're a lot alike, you know.
we laugh at the same things.
we have marvelous times together.
I sometimes wonder why you don't.
in my slow and careful way...
I've wondered sometimes, too.
why don't you? Just to be curious.
I haven't said that I don't.
Oh, no.
would it be too incredible?
it would be fantastic. -Then it is fantastic.
but I don't believe it. I don't believe that you mean it.
that you'll go on meaning it.
I shall wake up and find it isn't real at all.
it's just a dream. -No.
you do want me? I'm not just a schoolgirl to you?
darling, you're very sweet and dear to me.
I'm building a great hope on you.
I don't believe any of it.
at the office tomorrow, you'll have forgotten all about it.
I'll have Miss Hanson remind me.
Charles, darling, it's too wonderful.
take me out of here.
take me somewhere and kiss me.
yes? -Mr. Rainier, may I bring in
Yes, Miss Hanson. I'm sorry. Bring it in, please.
I've scribbled a note here. Will you take care of it? And this.
is the Ray-Novaille prospectus ready yet?
they promised it for 4: 00. I'll send it in as soon as it arrives.
you saw this offer from Harwood and Williams?
Yes, Mr. Rainier.
you worked for Harwood and Williams once, I believe.
they're driving a hard bargain.
do you think they're bluffing? -I think not.
I used to know Mr. Williams pretty well.
I was his secretary. -Yes. I remember he was quite annoyed...
...when you came to me. He called me a pirate.
that was not fair. It was really all my doing.
indeed?
I'd heard Miss Lindy was leaving you, and I applied for the position.
may I ask why?
a few weeks before, I'd come across a picture of you in a magazine.
underneath, it said, "Industrial Prince of England" .
dear me. -I was impressed.
I decided then I must leave Harwood and Williams to better myself.
I'm sincerely glad you did. You make things much easier for me.
what's all this?
that's the report on that firm in the Midlands.
the Melbridge Cable Company.
Yes, my brother thinks this would be a very valuable subsidiary.
I have a large file. Photographs of the works.
would you care to see it? -Please, yes.
bring me the Melbridge Cable Company report.
Yes, Miss Hanson.
hello.
Yes, I did, Mr. Manders. Can you make it 4: 30 this afternoon?
that would be splendid. He's very busy. Thank you.
market reports?
in 10 minutes, and thanks for the flowers. They're lovely.
I thought you'd like them.
thank you, Sheila.
their equipment's up-to-date.
and they seem to have plenty of space.
it does seem worth investigating.
I'll get my brother to run down.
I'm taking a long holiday.
are you? At once? - In about a month or so.
why, I think that's a very good idea.
I may be gone a year. If things can be arranged.
a year?
if it's humanly possible.
I'm being married, Miss Hanson.
you're the first to hear my news.
I'm afraid it'll mean a lot of extra work for you...
putting things in order so I can get away.
it's Miss Chilcet, I suppose. -Yes, it's Kitty.
was it so obvious? -Not at all. She's a very charming girl.
Yes, I fully agree.
I hope you won't take it into your head to follow my example, Miss Hanson.
I don't know what I should do without you.
I have been married, Mr. Rainier.
remember, I told you when I took the position.
Yes, to be sure. It slipped my memory.
you had a child, I believe.
Yes. A little boy. He died.
Yes. I remember. I'm sorry.
you'll see that Mr. Chetwynd gets this, will you?
and I'll let him have the file later.
Hello?
Yes, he's here. Miss Chilcet.
hello.
definitely. You want me to confirm it in writing?
you absurd young person.
what's that? No, Kitty. Of course not.
Paula, don't. -John, let me tell him.
that you're his wife? -Yes.
you can risk it, if you wish.
I hope you won't.
but what do I risk now?
what do you want of him, Paula? His name? His protection?
I want him as he was.
I want his love.
Paula, two years ago, you walked into his office.
if the sight of you did nothing to restore his memory...
what can words do?
when you came to me at Melbridge shortly after he disappeared...
I told you I was sure he hadn't deserted you knowingly.
I told you a door in his mind had opened, but another had closed.
I warned you even that if you found him...
the chances were he wouldn't recognize you.
you gave me a hope.
there's always that hope, but the impetus must come from within.
it can't be forced on him from outside.
you can tell him the truth and claim your legal rights.
but what is going to be his attitude when a strange woman appears...
and suddenly claims to be his wife?
he'd resent me.
he'd accept me.
he'd pity me...
and he'd resent me.
I can only offer you that frail hope that someday the miracle will happen...
and he'll come back to you, not as Charles Rainier, but as...
what was it you used to call him?
smithy. -As Smithy...
with all his emotion for you as warm and intact as it was...
...on the day he left you.
that's not much help to me, John, is it?
I'm real, these tears are real, and my jealousy is real...
and my need of him.
Paula, I wish I could help you.
what will you do?
I don't know. I'll have to think it out.
you go to your dinner. -I'll call it off if you'll dine with me.
no, don't do that.
dear John. Always firm, but kind.
thank you for the hope.
that is rather nice of me, seeing that it robs me of mine.
good night, John.
the law is quite clear on that point, Mrs. Smith.
if it is proved that for a period of not less than seven years...
no news of a person has been received...
,,,by those who would naturally hear of him if he were alive...
then he may be legally presumed dead.
you wish me to take the necessary steps?
please.
now, to complete the particulars.
did you prosecute a search?
Yes, we investigated accidents that had occurred on that day.
without result? -Yes.
then I became seriously ill.
I was ill for many months. My baby died.
as soon as I could get about, I made some effort to return to the stage...
but without success.
I worked as a waitress, a saleswoman.
I studied stenography at night school.
spent every penny I could spare trying to trace my husband.
thought he might have been taken to a hospital...
or perhaps an asylum.
but years passed, and I found no trace of him.
are you employed at present?
for the last two years, I've worked as a private secretary.
to whom? -To Mr. Charles Rainier.
I've studied your petition, Mrs. Smith...
and the affidavits attached.
in regard to the evidence presented, I have entered the decree to the effect...
...that the man known as John Smith shall be presumed to be dead...
and your marriage to him consequently dissolved.
Hello, you two!
I wish you'd remember you're getting married on Wednesday.
that odd little Mr. Beddoes has been waiting in the chapel for ages.
Oh, dear! How dreadful of me. I forgot. He wants us to choose the hymns.
we'll go down. Back in a few minutes. What's for tea?
muffins, old boy! Terrific!
that's nice.
I forget the words.
Yes, I remember now.
then there's another lovely one. Nearly always used.
this, perhaps: O Perfect Love.
Yes, that's it.
I like that. Don't you, Charles?
what is it, Kitty?
I'm sorry, darling. I must have been dreaming.
it's all right, Charles.
I'm glad it happened.
it's better. -Better?
what has happened?
I've been uncertain.
almost from the beginning.
now I'm sure.
it's no use, is it?
I've always known it. Really.
I was grasping selfishly at my own happiness.
because you could make me perfectly happy.
if I were selfish enough not to care...
or stupid enough not to know.
to know what?
that I'm not the one.
let's be honest about it.
I was letting things drift.
but I never really believed in my own luck.
Charles, you looked at me just now as if I were a stranger.
an intrusive stranger.
trying to take the place of someone else.
someone else?
I know it sounds absurd, but let me say it.
sometimes...
especially when we've been closest...
I've had a curious feeling that I remind you of someone else.
someone you once knew.
don't leave me, Kitty. I need you.
I'm trying to make a life.
with someone you love as you'll never love me.
I am nearly the one, Charles.
so nearly that I shall always be proud of it.
but nearly isn't enough for a lifetime.
it would be too hard to...
I've left it rather late, haven't l? I'm sorry.
I think I'll travel.
mother's going to Luxor, I believe. I'll go with her.
Kitty... -It's all right, Charles.
I asked for it, and I'll get over it.
one does, you know.
I shan't go in any tragic mood...
but looking to see what fun I can find, and I usually can.
you'll probably hear that I've married some nice man.
I don't know what to say.
you don't have to say anything.
but because I am so nearly the one...
and because I love you more than anyone I shall ever marry...
will you kiss me goodbye?
well, we can't keep this up indefinitely.
where in the devil is he?
no normal man walks out of a big concern without saying a word to a solitary soul.
everything was arranged. Could he have gone abroad?
he would have let us know. Confound that girl!
what the deuce could have happened?
one minute they were picking hymns for the wedding
Mr. Chetwynd? -What now?
I'm sorry, sir. It seems to be important. Stourton of the Lytham Liberal League.
all right, I'll see him. You talk to Sheldon.
Sheldon, when did you say you last saw Mr. Rainier?
it was close to dinnertime, miss. About an hour after Miss Kitty left.
Mr. Charles asked me to put some things into a bag for him.
I don't know quite why, miss...
but I sort of think that he may have gone to Liverpool.
to Liverpool? -Yes, miss.
it was from Liverpool he came that night...
...that he came back from the dead, as you might say.
please try to tell me everything you can remember about that night in 1920.
what did he tell you about what had happened to him?
well, miss, it was a wet night. In November, it was.
he'd been knocked down by a taxi and carried into a chemist's shop in Liverpool.
come in.
miss Hanson.
please forgive me for coming. We were all so anxious.
you're not well.
I should have let you know where I was. I intended to. I'm sorry.
I hate to bother you, but something very important came up.
how did you know I was in Liverpool?
something Sheldon said. I made inquiries. -Sheldon, yes.
won't you sit down, Miss Hanson?
you say some important business induced you to follow me?
sir Edward Lake, Member of Parliament from West Lytham...
died on Monday morning. There will be a by-election.
this morning, a committee of the West Lytham Liberal Association...
...unanimously decided to support your candidacy...
should you consent to stand in the Liberal interest.
did Sheldon tell you of my experience here about 12 years ago?
Yes, Mr. Rainier.
I came back here at that time...
hoping to stumble on the trail of my past...
but I failed then...
and I've failed now.
nothing helped you? -Nothing.
why should I feel a sense of loss so acute that...
that it's spoiling your life?
no, I'm not being honest with myself.
my life's not complete, and I've hurt others.
I don't know why I bore you with my affairs.
you feel that perhaps you lived in Liverpool?
it seems possible. -But not certain.
you mean I might have been visiting the city?
well, Liverpool's a big port.
I might have come in on some ship. Strange. That hadn't occurred to me.
or by train.
you might have come in from a nearby town...
or from the country.
perhaps on business. -Perhaps.
in that case, maybe you stayed at some hotel.
I know Liverpool. I've been up here often.
you know the direction you were walking in when the accident happened?
Yes, I checked that.
I was walking down Mason Street toward the square. It was wet.
well, there are two hotels north of Mason Street.
there's the old Olympic and the Great Northern.
it's quite a distance from the Olympic.
so, if it was wet, the chances are, you were coming from the Great Northern.
presuming I stayed at a hotel at all, under what name was I registered?
there's just one chance to find out.
if you were at a hotel, you walked out leaving unclaimed luggage.
would they keep it so long?
it's worth investigating. -Yes.
I'm glad you came, Miss Hanson. You've given me fresh hope.
you must come with me. We'll start with the Great Northern.
please be kind enough to tell the manager this suitcase is of no interest to me...
and I'm sorry to have troubled him.
John Smith.
highly unimaginative incognito.
what could be more anonymous than these poor rags?
nothing seemed familiar to you? -No.
there's a finality about that most unrewarding find:
like a door slammed and bolted.
now I shall learn to accept myself for what I am:
a psychological defective. As Kitty saw me. As you must see me.
you must keep my secret, Miss Hanson.
will you send a telegram to the West Lytham Liberal Association...
...telling them I'll receive the Committee tomorrow?
Yes, Mr. Rainier.
there's an express to London at 8: 15. -I'll make reservations.
congratulations, Mr. Rainier. Famous victory.
the Prime Minister's delighted. Our new member from Lytham.
Yes. Congratulations. -Thank you.
it's good to have you with us, sir. -Thank you.
the party is honored, Mr. Rainier. -Thank you, sir.
Mr. Rainier, congratulations. -Thank you very much.
miss Hanson.
my compliments, Mr. Rainier. A great triumph.
thank you.
have I kept you waiting? I was delayed.
nice of you to come down for my debut.
was I satisfactory? -Very.
waiter, some tea, please.
what would you like? Cake? Sandwiches?
bring an assortment. -Thank you.
by the way, I haven't really thanked you for your help in the campaign.
I don't know what I should have done without you.
I thoroughly enjoyed it. Politics interest me.
do they? I'm glad of that.
you're staring at me, you know.
I'm sorry. It struck me your hair is bright red in the sunshine.
was that all? You were looking so intensely.
everyone has these feelings of having lived through certain moments before.
you mean, you have the feeling that you've known me before?
I had, for a moment.
as a matter of fact, I felt it quite strongly the first day you came into my office.
you didn't show it. -No?
ls that why you engaged me? -Perhaps.
it was also your air of quiet efficiency.
forgive me...
but is there any possibility that you might marry again?
not the slightest.
I'm asking you because I have a proposal to make.
I need your help in my parliamentary life.
social secretary? -Not exactly.
you know...
it seemed quite a reasonable idea when it came to me.
but now, I'm rather losing my nerve.
Why? Is it so startling?
it may sound outrageous to you, but it's not a sudden impulse.
I've thought it over very carefully.
you and I are in the same boat, Miss Hanson.
we're both ghost-ridden.
that sounds a bit romantic, but I think it expresses it.
we are prisoners of our past.
Yes.
what if we were to pool our loneliness...
and give each other what little we have: support, friendship?
I'm proposing marriage, Miss Hanson.
or should I call it a merger?
you know, I'm good at mergers.
a Member of Parliament should have a wife, Margaret.
so I'm told on all sides. "He needs a clever hostess.
you have exceptional gifts.
would it interest you to have a wider field for them?
you need have no fear that I would make any emotional demands upon you.
I have only sincere friendship to offer.
I won't ask any more from you.
please. Don't answer at once. Think it over.
it's completely a selfish proposal...
but I can't have you giving me notice, you know.
I'd be lost without you.
miss Hanson... Margaret...
have I hurt you? -I don't know.
this comes of boasting that I never cry.
you will think about it? I'll call you tomorrow.
no, I can't wait so long. Tonight, about 9: 00?
I hope the answer will be yes.
here's the tea.
it wasn't a very flattering proposal, really.
rather, a suggestion for a merger.
he used that very expression.
pretty cold-blooded, isn't it? -Well, it's honest.
I'm sorry. Sorry for myself.
I want you to be happy, Paula. - It may work out.
he might even fall in love with me.
would that be so very extraordinary?
it would be very extraordinary if he didn't.
but the situation is very extraordinary.
it seems rather hard, what I'm going to say...
but if you marry him, keep to his terms.
I suppose you're right.
and you love him?
Yes.
you're going to be hurt, Paula.
John, don't be against it.
Hello?
Yes, Mr. Rainier.
Charles. You're early.
it's yes, Charles.
isn't that Mrs. Rainier, who gives those political dinners?
lady Rainier. He was in the birthday honors.
they say he'll be in the Cabinet.
pity there's no son to inherit the title.
such a wonderful couple. I hear he's devoted to her.
well, it's really amazing. She's got him to dance.
she's got him to smile, too. That woman is a marvel.
good night, Sheldon, and thank you. You managed beautifully.
thank you, milady.
thank you, Sheldon. -Good night, Mr. Charles.
you certainly mellowed the old gentleman.
he was positively purring when I put him into the car.
Yes, I think he really enjoyed himself.
I know I did. -Nonsense.
good heavens! It's nearly 3: 00. You have two committees tomorrow.
today. -Yes, that's true. It's nearly morning.
the morning of May 25. Does that suggest something to you?
it's the anniversary of our wedding. Our third anniversary.
will you wait just a moment? You don't look the least bit tired.
all my gratitude goes with this, Margaret.
I owe you more than I can put into words.
it's too beautiful, really. You spoil me.
the emerald is said to have belonged to the Empress Marie Louise.
Really? That's thrilling.
will you put it on for me?
there. How do you like it?
do you know you're a very beautiful woman?
thank you. I rather hoped you thought that.
Margaret...
are you happy?
why do you ask? -A twinge of conscience.
if I hadn't interfered in your life-- -I should have never been Lady Rainier...
...entertained the Prime Minister, worn a queen's emerald.
is it enough?
perhaps not.
is there anyone else?
no.
Charles, why are you asking me? -Because if there were...
I've often wanted to say this, I wouldn't hold you to our bargain.
I haven't the right.
you're trying to get rid of me, Charles? -You know I'd be utterly lost without you.
I'm glad to hear that, because I like my job.
a woman told me tonight that she envied me more than anyone she knew.
she envied me my husband, Charles.
most women do.
now I really am tired.
good night, Charles, and thank you for the wonderful present.
good night, Margaret.
Smithy!
Margaret, I'm afraid I said something to hurt you.
no, Charles.
if I expressed myself clumsily...
it's nothing, really. It's just that... -I wish you would be frank with me.
do you?
were those a gift?
Yes.
I came across them quite by chance.
they're just cheap little beads.
but they have a value for you that this does not?
he said they were the color of my eyes.
they are, aren't they?
Oh, Margaret.
isn't there something morbid in burying one's heart with the dead?
that's a strange thing for you to say. -ls it?
you haven't even a memory.
no.
and the best of you...
your capacity for loving...
...your joy in living is buried in a little space of time you've forgotten.
it isn't quite the same thing. -Why not?
because in some vague way, I still have...
hope? -Yes, I suppose that's it.
have you, Charles?
do you feel that there really is someone?
that someday you may find her?
I'd rather not talk of it, Margaret.
it's nothing I could put into words.
but doesn't it frighten you sometimes...
that the years are passing...
that you may sometime find that you've lost your capacity for happiness?
you may have come so near her.
you may even have brushed by her in the street.
Yes, I've thought of that.
you might even have met her, Charles.
met her and not known her.
it might be someone you know.
Charles, it might even be me.
Oh, Margaret.
I know I'm talking wildly.
it's after 3: 00, and I'm tired. -Yes.
I've sometimes thought I'd like to travel. I feel I need a change and a rest.
to travel? -Yes. I've never been out of England.
I'd like to go to Buenos Aires or Rio or somewhere colorful and distracting.
perhaps when the House adjourns
I don't want to drag you away. I'll take a maid. Or a friend, perhaps.
Margaret, I believe you want to get away from me.
no.
it's just that it's been a strain.
I'm just a little nobody, you know. It's been harder than I thought...
...being the wife of Charles Rainier.
if you wish, of course.
you are a little overtired, I think.
shall we talk about it in the morning? - In the morning, yes.
good night, Margaret. - Good night, Charles.
smithy.
I think this is my compartment.
Yes, it is.
I hope Harrison has made everything smooth for you.
Thanks. Yes, he's been very helpful.
he should be here any moment with my letter of credit.
will you have only two days in the country?
Yes. My boat sails on Wednesday.
it's on your way, this place. -No. It's in Devon.
it's a quiet little country village...
...with a delightful old inn. I wanted to see it again.
I was once very happy there.
I'm glad I'm not late. Hello, sir.
I made you out an itinerary. I thought you'd like to study it on the ship.
how kind of you.
here's your letter of credit. -Thank you.
and some magazines. I'll put these in the compartment.
I think you'll find everything in order.
I hope you have a wonderful trip. -Thank you.
don't stay away too long.
if I do, blame your excellent arrangements.
goodbye. -Goodbye.
I'll wait for you, sir. I have a message from Mr. Chetwynd.
well, goodbye, Charles.
Margaret, I wish you weren't going.
I don't feel quite happy about it.
you'll let me hear from you? -Of course.
goodbye.
you're going to the house? -No, to the office. There's some trouble.
seems strange not to talk it over with you, Margaret.
this strike, sir, it's pretty serious.
strike?
at the Melbridge Cable Works. The men are out of hand.
Melbridge. Yes, of course.
it's all right, men. We've got our terms.
the strike is settled, and we've won!
thanks to one man:
sir Charles Rainier!
first back streets we came through.
here. Let's pop in here for a whiskey and soda.
thank you kindly, sir. We appreciate it.
what will you have, gents? -Two double McWhirters and soda, please.
two double Macs. Right-o, sir. Here we are, sir.
is that the proprietor?
Yes, sir. That's the Biffer. Was, I should say.
he ain't much like that now. That's him at the end.
he was a gentleman, the gunner was.
not like these softies what call theirselves heavyweights today.
why, he'd take two of them for breakfast!
he didn't wear no fancy dressing gown...
well, we mustn't lose our train. We better go.
thank you, sir.
the fog's getting thicker. -Yes. Beastly.
cigarette? -Sorry. I don't smoke.
of course not.
never mind. There's a little tobacconist just around the corner.
well?
packet of Barclay Blue Ribbons, please. -Yes, sir.
thank you, sir. -Thank you.
good night, sir. -Good night.
I thought you said you'd never been in Melbridge.
I haven't.
but you said, "There's a little tobacconist just around the corner.
you said, "There's a little tobacconist just around the corner" .
I said that?
that shop was off the main street.
you couldn't have seen it on your way from the station.
no.
then how did you know of it?
I don't know. -You went straight to it.
I did know, but I don't know how.
Melbridge. -What's the matter?
Melbridge.
are you ill, sir? Let me get a cab.
no, let me think. There's something.
that shop...
that woman.
there's a taxi. I'll get it.
here you are, sir.
where is the hospital?
you mean the old one or the new one, sir?
the old one, I think.
it's on a hill.
big gates...
a high wall all around it.
that don't sound much like either of them.
you wouldn't be meaning the asylum, would you, sir?
look here, sir.
you say you came out of these gates?
Yes. I'm sure of that.
there was some excitement and a great deal of noise.
then let's start from here.
try and retrace your steps.
now.
you must have gone into town.
Yes, I'd been to that shop.
perhaps as we go, you can piece the thing together.
Yes, that's right. That's a good idea.
I came along this path.
you remember that? -Yes, I think so.
there was a good deal of fog...
and people shouting, and the sound of...
like I was trying to get away from something...
...trying to escape.
there was some danger, and I was afraid.
I was...
there was a girl.
Yes, there was a girl!
the mist is lifting.
Yes. It looks as if it will be a nice day after all.
could you take the luggage to the station and wait for me?
I've lots of time. I think I'd like to walk.
right you are, ma'am. I'll wait for you by the newsstand.
you're leaving us now? I do hope you'll come and see us again.
not very soon, I'm afraid.
I'm sailing for South America at 2: 00. -You are? My, I envy you.
are you sure you'd prefer to walk to the station?
Yes. Such a pretty walk.
I used to live here, you know, years ago.
Mrs. Deventer's time. Did you know her?
no, not very well. She died three years ago.
so Albert was telling me.
she was quite a character, Mrs. Deventer. Lots of people ask after her.
there was a gentleman in here a few minutes ago...
asking after Mrs. Deventer and the old vicar.
Really? I should be going. I don't want to have to hurry.
goodbye, Miss Barnes. Thank you.
I'm sure you'll have a wonderful trip. -Thank you.
did you say a gentleman was asking for Mrs. Deventer?
Yes, miss, and the old vicar.
that's Mr. Durham, you know. He lives at Seven Oaks.
Mr. Pauly's our vicar now.
ls the gentleman staying here? -No.
he was looking for a cottage. Said he used to rent one here years ago.
he remembered it was near the church.
was he a friend of yours, miss?
excuse me.
Smithy?
Oh, Smithy!
darling!
Paula!
...to a remote and guarded building in the English Midlands:
Melbridge County Asylum.
grimly proud of its new military wing...
which barely suffices...
in this autumn of 1918...
to house the shattered minds...
of the war that was to end war.
now, Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd...
I should warn you that even if he is your son...
he may not recognize you.
his memory is affected, and he has trouble with his speech:
the result of shock.
he was picked up by the Germans...
in a shell hole near Arras in 1917...
...close to death and with no means of identification.
when he returned to consciousness in a German hospital...
he could remember nothing at all of his past life.
he had no name...
he had no family with whom he could correspond.
six months ago, he was exchanged through Switzerland and sent here.
I sincerely hope he proves to be your son.
I believe that he could be cured...
with patience and care in normal surroundings.
may we see him now?
certainly.
please, Mrs. Lloyd, don't hope too much. I've seen many disappointments.
good morning, boys. This is just an informal visit.
good morning, Clayton.
sleeping better? You just keep it up.
well, now, Trempitt, what's going on?
I thought you and I were friends. Last time we shook hands.
don't you remember?
well, don't bother today if you don't feel like it.
you can't discourage me.
there. You see, my boy? That's the spirit.
you and I will be going into town very soon for a glass of beer...
to Melbridge Arms.
would you like that?
fine. Won't be long now.
well, Smith...
you are looking better, really improved.
don't you think so, Doctor? -Very much.
we have some news for you. Interested?
there are some people here who are very anxious to see you.
Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd.
Lloyd?
the name mean anything to you?
their son was reported missing in 1917.
at Arras.
now don't pin your hopes on it.
you may be their son, you may not.
we'll soon know.
my parents.
there. You see, my boy? You speak well enough when you want to.
it's just a matter of confidence.
you've just got to get back your confidence.
my father.
doctor, dress him up a bit and take him to the reception room.
very well. Come along, Smith.
Lloyd.
sit down, old man.
if they are your parents...
they would take me out of here?
that's rather a big if, old man. Sit down.
Lloyd.
he is not your son, then? -No.
I'm sincerely sorry.
I told you, my boy, not to count on it.
out in this weather, Major? You are a one for a walk, ain't you?
proper old pea soup this is.
I'm all right, thank you.
coat's very warm.
I like to walk.
proper old pea soup.
the war's over! Peace!
there's an armistice!
what is it you want?
come on, I haven't got all night.
cigarette.
what sort?
why, you're from the asylum. You're...
it's all right, dear. You take your time.
have a nice look around, see. I'll be back in a jiffy.
you are from the asylum, aren't you?
Yes, but I'm all right, really.
if you have given them the slip, I wouldn't stay here.
she's gone straight to the phone. She's telling them to come for you.
can I help you?
I thought you weren't feeling too fit, so I followed you.
you don't mind, do you?
you look tired out.
been walking about for hours?
well, how about a brandy and soda...
just to pull you together? I'm gonna have one.
shall we go over to the home pub? It's just across the road.
it's not the Ritz, but it's where we all stay when our show's in town.
it's, you know, friendly.
come on.
excuse us, please.
that was Ella. She's our character woman, and he's our manager.
Hello, Sam. -Hello, Paula.
he's a dear, really.
Hello, Paula. -Hello, Brett.
have a drink, and the army, too.
there, you see? You're amongst friends. -Mind you, he was game, the gunner was.
halfway through the 10th, he run into my right hook...
and forgot his name and address.
you don't win fights with your hands and feet.
you win them with your brains.
that's what brought me to the top.
what's it to be, my dear? This is on the house.
thank you, Biffer.
mine's a Gin and French. Can I have a brandy for my friend here?
with pleasure, my dear. Looks as though he could do with it.
feeling bad?
no, l-- -He's just tired, that's all.
not the flu, is it? Got them in the back.
dying like flies at the hospital.
that's right, cheer him up. Know any more funny stories?
I was only passing a remark. It's a free country.
pass him the free drink. That'll do him more good.
well, here it is, and a drop of good stuff that is.
bring anybody back from the grave. -The grave?
aren't you a little ray of sunshine tonight?
Paula. Don't be late. -No, I won't, Sam.
I've got to get over to the theater. Goodbye, and thanks for the drinks.
shall we go? -Well, there goes a hero for you.
he's one of the men what done it. -Right.
I must get over to the theater. I've cut it pretty close.
it doesn't seem very friendly, does it, running away like this?
what are you going to do? Will you be all right?
what am I to do with you? -I'll be all right.
I'm not so sure.
listen, how'd you like to see the show?
you can sit in my dressing room, see the stage. No one will bother you.
then we'll have a chat, shall we?
just you and l, and settle what's to be done.
good? Good, come on.
sorry to keep you waiting all this time, but I'm so excited about peace.
I've got one eyebrow halfway up my forehead and the other behind my left ear.
just a second. I'll be with you.
well? How do you like me?
or don't you?
good.
now, talk to me. Tell me all about yourself.
why'd you give them the slip up at the hospital?
you don't like the place?
surely you ought not to be there.
come on. Answer me.
cat got your tongue?
make an effort.
I'm all right, really.
it's my speech. It's just nerves.
there, you see? You're doing splendidly.
Yes, I wasn't so bad then, was l?
I should say not.
you don't know what a job I have...
as a rule.
I can guess. I heard you up at that shop. That old witch would scare anybody.
there's another thing.
I've lost my memory.
I don't even know who I am.
you mean...
I know who you are. You're somebody awfully nice.
what did they call you at that place?
Smith.
it's not my real name.
what's yours? -Paula Ridgeway.
that's not my real name, either.
look here, Smithy. You don't mind if I call you Smithy, do you?
it can't be good for you up there among all those poor souls.
you can't be happy.
and how are you ever going to get better if you're unhappy?
perhaps I shouldn't be very happy...
...anywhere just now.
but, Smithy, the war's over. Doesn't that mean anything to you?
I'm just silly. Don't take any notice. It's the day.
it's so splendid for most of us and so sad for some.
why did it have to be foggy and wet?
it should have been all sunshine and golden day.
never mind, Smithy. We've met, anyway, haven't we?
have you no friends, no parents that you can trace?
have you tried?
some people came to see me at the hospital...
but I wasn't their son.
I'll bet they were disappointed, weren't they?
Yes, I think so.
I was, too.
I'd have liked to belong to them.
smithy, you're ruining my makeup.
but how you do chatter.
Yes, I seem to have talked rather a lot.
that's me. I always bring people out.
much too far, sometimes.
Ridgeway. -All right, thank you.
I've got to go and perform now.
smithy, look...
I'll put your chair outside. Come along.
you can see the front of the stage from here.
just sit there and nobody will bother you. I'll be back in a couple of shakes.
you'll be all right, will you? -I'm fine.
sure?
your head seems awfully hot.
Paula. You're on. -Coming.
I spoke to her father and asked, "Could I marry Daisy?
" certainly you can," he says.
certainly. On one condition.
" name it! " says l.
says he, "Get married in the house and after the ceremony...
...you leave by the back door.
leave by the back door? Why would we do that?
he say, "I'm telling you, you leave by the back door...
so that the hens can get the benefit of the rice" .
I love her for herself alone.
she's the bonniest wee lassie in all Scotland.
as Harry would say...
I knew the minute I seen him, he had the flu.
Biffer, there's something I ought to tell you.
he's from the county asylum. -No.
but he's all right, really.
he would have been discharged if he had a home to go to.
you don't think they'll come after him, do you?
any busybody comes snooping after him...
I'll give him what I give the gunner.
Biffer, you're a darling. -He's a gentlemen, he is.
liked him the minute I first clapped eyes on him.
I'm all right.
it's just my speech. I can't remember.
rest now, Smithy. You mustn't talk.
I'm not like the others.
I'm not like them. I'm all right.
Yes, Smithy, you're all right.
but I can't go back.
if I go back, I'll never come out. I'll be like the others.
you shan't go back, Smithy. I won't let you go back.
rest now.
rest, Smithy.
just go to sleep.
hurry down. Supper's on the table. The train leaves at 1: 00.
I'm all packed. I'll be back in a jiffy.
how did the show go?
splendidly. The last night.
glad to get rid of us, I expect.
how did you get on?
I talked to the chambermaid today.
had quite a chat with her. -You did?
wonderful. What about?
the weather.
you are coming on.
I see you're all packed. That's a good boy. So am l.
our train leaves at 1: 00.
Paula. -Yes, Smithy?
you're sure I can be useful?
your manager isn't just taking me on...
because you asked him?
good gracious, you don't know Sam. He's as hard as nails.
no, you can take my word for it. The whole thing was his idea.
I can't tell you what it means, Paula.
to be someone again, to be wanted.
it's all your doing.
how you do run on.
there's no stopping you once you've started.
you just eat your supper.
I'll go down and I'll be up again in time to fetch you for the train.
goodbye.
the usual? -Please, Biffer.
Sam, he's as pleased as punch. I wish you could have heard him.
you are an angel.
that's all right, old girl.
it's given him confidence just knowing that he's wanted.
that's all he needs to get well.
there you are. -Thank you, Biffer.
evening, Mr. W. What's it to be?
half and half, and rush it, will you? They've been watching me like hawks...
since I blotted me copybook Armistice Day.
Why?
one of our loonies slipped off in the fog...
while I was supposed to be watching the gate.
got clean away, uniform and all.
no. Really? But you got him back, didn't you?
not yet, but we shall.
what sort of a bloke? -It's getting late.
Tallish, dark hair, shuffles a bit.
can't get his words out. Always thinking something different.
he's not dangerous, I suppose?
there's no saying with loonies. Quiet as mice for weeks.
then all of a sudden, up and after you with an ax.
Sam, I'm going in to supper. You coming?
just a moment, Paula.
Ella, coming? -Coming.
it's time, isn't it? Nearly 12: 30.
smithy. -I'm all ready.
sit down a minute, will you?
there's nothing wrong, is there?
smithy, I've got to talk to you.
I won't beat about the bush. Sam won't take you.
won't take me?
there was a man from the asylum in the bar just now.
he told everybody about your escape.
Sam feels it's too risky taking you.
I think perhaps he's right.
I think perhaps you should go back to the asylum...
until you're all well again, and then...
go back?
it is best, Smithy.
you need care, and you need doctors that understand your case.
I feel dreadful about it, but it's for your sake.
Sam wants to help...
but he says I have no right to take you.
he says I'd be risking your sanity.
your life, perhaps. You do understand, don't you?
you're not angry with me? You don't think that I've gone back on you?
it's not that I'm afraid.
it's because I think it's right. They were all against me, all of them.
they couldn't have made me do it if I didn't think it was right.
you do know that, Smithy, don't you?
tell me you understand, that you're not angry with me.
but tell me. Let me hear you say it.
speak to me, Smithy.
you could always speak to me.
wait for me, Smithy.
come on, Smithy. Get your coat on.
I know I'm right. I know it.
I'm ashamed of myself, letting them talk me out of it.
here. Let me help you. We'll have to hurry.
don't you worry, Smithy. We can't go with the others...
but we'll find some quiet place where you can rest and get fit.
here's your hat. Take your parcels. Come on.
we'll go by the back door.
I've got to see the Biffer.
go that way. Don't let anyone see you. There's a door leading to the alley.
wait for me outside. I'll only be a minute.
Biffer, here's the money for my bill.
what? Off already?
they want to send Smithy back to the asylum.
no.
I'm not gonna let him go. I'm taking him into the country.
giving up your job?
I'll let you know when we get settled.
will you send my trunk on to me? -You bet, and good luck to you.
Thanks, Biffer. You're one in a million. Goodbye.
goodbye. Good luck.
smithy, what have you done?
he tried to stop you? -Yes.
Sam?
I pushed him and he fell.
if they get you now, you're done for.
I'm no good. Let me alone. -No. I won't.
we can't leave him. -We must.
we'll think later. Come.
but I'm no good. I'd better go back.
that was bad luck, the stationmaster recognizing me at Melbridge.
they may have wired ahead to Canford to stop us.
well, we won't go on to Canford.
we'll get out at Swinton Junction.
from Swinton, we can go into the west country to Devon or Cornwall.
we'll choose some little country place, quiet and lovely.
it's the end of the world.
lonely and lovely.
we'll be safe here, even if...
we'll phone first, and then we'll see.
all right, Mrs. Deventer, he can come for a couple of hours tomorrow...
and I'll look in on Friday.
thank you, Doctor. -Goodbye.
goodbye.
morning, ma'am. -Good morning.
sorry I wasn't down.
were you wanting rooms? -Well, that depends.
may I use your telephone? -Certainly. It's in there.
thank you.
smithy, come and sit down. You look worn out.
he does look poorly. The poor dear.
is this the phone?
Yes. You just picks it up, turns the handle
Yes. Thank you.
I want to make a trunk call, please.
Melbridge 4294.
what?
Clevedon 2707.
Hello?
Hello, Paula.
no, he's all right. Come to in a jiffy.
right as rain, barring a bump on his head.
big as an apple, it was.
that fellow of yours must have given him what I gave the gunner.
what? A bump.
Biffer, don't make me laugh. I'll go into hysterics. What?
he is an angel. So are you.
do you mind if I rush off now and tell Smithy? He'll be so happy.
a thousand thanks, darling, and goodbye.
smithy, it's all right.
isn't it wonderful? Sam's all right.
now you have nothing to worry about, nothing.
Sam's being awfully decent about it. He says it was just an accident.
an accident?
it's a friend of ours who had a bad fall.
we were terribly worried about him, but it's all right.
and we would like to stay...
that is, if you can have us.
well, I've got a nice double front. Sun comes in all day.
just the thing for your husband after the flu.
he's not my husband.
not yet, I mean. We're just sort of engaged.
I've got two nice rooms adjoining...
...with hot and cold and a view of the lake.
if you'd like to come up.
smithy, isn't it wonderful?
I'm so thankful. I was terribly worried.
all you have to do is to get well, and you will get well, won't you...
in this lovely place? Say it. Let me hear you say it.
I will. -That's the spirit.
I had to tell her we were engaged. You don't mind, do you?
I thought you was behind me.
don't you want to see the rooms?
I'm sorry. Yes, of course. We're just coming.
come on, Smithy.
if I were you, I'd open it.
smithy, you are a fraud. I'm simply dying of curiosity.
it's from Liverpool, from that newspaper.
I say. So it is.
liverpool Mercury. Managing Editor, Samuel C. Henson.
must be about that article you sent them.
Yes, I suppose it could be. -For pity's sake, Smithy, open it.
it's a check. -I don't believe it. Let me look.
it's a small check, but it's a check.
smithy, how wonderful.
aren't you terribly happy? -Yes, I am.
means an awful lot. -Smithy, I'm proud of you.
you didn't know you had an author on your hands, did you?
Yes, I did. I knew you were good. I'm really not a bit surprised.
you think I can sell another?
another and another and another. Lots of them.
smithy, I wonder if you were a writer before you...
before the war. -Yes, I've wondered that, too.
aren't you terribly curious? About the past, I mean?
well, I'd like to know, but the present's looking up.
supposing it all came back to you suddenly...
and it was awfully grand, with all sorts of wonderful people?
I wouldn't mind a bit.
you might even be married, Smithy. Who knows?
nonsense.
how can you be so sure? -Well, because...
Paula, I wonder if I could make a living at writing.
of course you could.
make a regular income, be independent.
why not?
and I'm getting quite good at typewriting.
it's a lot of nerve, but...
I've fallen in love with you.
no, you haven't. You're just being a gentleman.
no. I'm nothing of the sort.
I'm asking you to marry me...
on a check for two guineas.
smithy, don't ask me, please.
I might take you up on it. I'm just that shameless.
Paula.
I've run after you from the very beginning. You know I have.
I've never let you out of my sight since I first saw you in that little shop.
never do it, Paula. -What?
never leave me out of your sight. Never again.
smithy, you do mean it?
you do want it? Really?
more than anything else in the world.
my life began with you.
I can't imagine a future without you.
I better say yes quickly before you change your mind.
it's yes, darling.
now I can relax.
I'm hungry.
smithy. -What is it?
but, darling, you proposed to me...
and I've accepted you...
what's wrong?
smithy, do I always have to take the initiative?
you're supposed to kiss me, darling.
goodbye.
I'm so happy for you. -Goodbye. God bless you both.
Thanks, Vicar. Thanks, Doctor. Thanks again for all your kindness.
here. Take this. -Doctor, no.
that's all right. Keep it for the christening.
goodbye. -Goodbye.
I must oil that hinge.
wait.
I must cut that back. -No, darling. It's so pretty.
home.
home.
today, is it, sir? -I think so.
have you got the nurse in? -Three days ago.
pretty trying, this business. -I know how you feel, sir.
been through it myself.
did your wife suffer much? -No, nothing to speak of.
but me, crikey.
got neuralgia, have you?
I don't think so. -Lucky.
I had it something cruel with our second.
what they call synthetic pain. -Do they?
that's the scientific name for it.
I said I'd never face it again, but you know how it is.
here I am with four and more bad news on the way.
well, good luck to you, sir.
it's all right, Smith.
she's out of danger now. It's been a hard fight, but she's made it...
and you have a son.
come on. Pull yourself together. She's all right.
nothing in the world to worry you now. It's a boy. That's what you wanted.
and eight pounds of him, too.
don't you want to see her after all her trouble?
of course you do.
good morning. I've dropped in to register a new subject.
name of child? -We're calling him John, after me.
my wife thinks he's the image of me, but I don't see it.
Really? And the date?
he has her eyes, blue, and when he smiles...
he's just like my wife, except for the teeth.
Yes, well, you can't expect everything all at once.
what did you say the date was? -November 6.
don't you want his weight? -No, thank you.
eight pounds, three and a half ounces. He's gained an ounce a day since.
it's remarkable. -Father's profession?
writer. In a small way, of course.
writer and parent. Parent in a big way.
that will be all. Yes. Thank you.
but you can form only a very inadequate picture of him...
from what I've given you. -I'll have to struggle along.
I'll bring him in one of these days. -Do that.
then you can see for yourself. Do I get a receipt?
you do.
thank you very much. I'll bring him in. -Do that.
Hi, nurse!
here you are. I don't think I forgot a thing.
is he asleep? -If he was, he isn't now.
wait.
did I wake him? -No.
I brought him a present.
will he like it? Will he know it's a cat?
smithy. -Yes.
come here. -What?
no, here.
look, I'm Mrs. Smith. Do you remember me?
what's so wonderful about that fellow? He just eats and sleeps.
much of the time, he's not even friendly.
it would never occur to you to buy me a present, would it?
never.
smithy. -They're not very much.
I adore them, darling. -They're just the color of your eyes.
you're an awfully nice color scheme, darling...
and your hair is like a bright new penny.
Mr. and Mrs. Smith here? -Yes.
it must be the vicar.
Hello, Vicar! Come in. -Good morning.
is it all right for the vicar to come in? Good heavens!
how do you do, Mrs. Smith? How are you?
very well, thank you, Vicar.
and how is the heir? -Take a look.
Hello, young fellow. He's quite a size, isn't he?
bigger and stronger than babies twice his age.
I was at the post office just now.
I found Mrs. Goodbody in a lather of excitement.
there had been an extraordinary event. A telegram!
no. -How very thrilling. Who got it?
you did. -l?
probably someone congratulating you upon becoming a father.
aren't you ever going to tell me what's in it?
I can't believe it. It's fantastic.
darling, please, I can't stand it another second.
it's from Liverpool, from the editor of The Mercury.
read it out loud.
can you appear at Mercury office 1 0: 00 tomorrow morning...
november 14, regarding permanent position on paper?
samuel C. Henson, Editor.
Oh, darling.
smithy, how marvelous.
marvelous? It's incredible.
can you appear at Mercury office tomorrow morning...
goodness, you're a terrible packer.
let me see, shirts, socks, tie...
may I ask what you're going to sleep in?
great Scott! Have I forgotten the pajamas?
this cuff's a bit frayed, but I don't suppose Keats was very dressy.
that's better.
all these labels.
he'll think I'm a commercial traveler.
are you excited? -Wildly.
think what it means. A start in life, a career.
I'll be able to do things for you, things I've always dreamed of.
I wish I could come, too.
Yes. I've been thinking of that, but I daren't wait.
he might change his mind.
darling, you're not worrying about me, are you?
I'll be all right. I feel absolutely sure of myself.
I know. I shan't worry.
it's just...
our first parting.
when will you be back? -Tomorrow night.
I'll be in on the 8: 00 train.
where will you stay? -I hadn't thought.
the Great Northern isn't bad.
it's the best of the cheap hotels and it's near the station.
got your key? -Yes.
that must be the vicar. I must run.
goodbye, darling.
goodbye, young fellow.
take very good care of my little family. -Indeed, I will, sir.
goodbye, darling. See you tomorrow night.
tomorrow night. Good luck, Smithy.
can you tell me, where is the Mercury Office?
the Liverpool Mercury.
second on the left, sir, off George Street.
Thanks. -Taxi, sir? Looks like rain.
no, thanks. I'll take a chance.
paper! Get your paper! Paper, sir?
read The Liverpool Mercury!
election results! Paper, ma'am? Paper, sir?
read The Liverpool Mercury! Election results! Paper, sir?
liverpool Mercury-- -ls this George Street?
I'm looking for the Mercury office. -Right across the street, on the corner.
paper! Paper, sir?
look out!
call an ambulance.
he'll be all right. He's coming around now.
feeling better?
you've got an unholy bump there.
looks worse than it is, though.
you're lucky, I'd say.
do you feel any pain? -My head aches a bit.
it would be funny if it didn't. Quite a wallop.
my shoes.
a good blacking is all they need.
what on earth...
this is all wrong.
I've no business to be in civvies. -What should you be in?
in uniform, of course. I'm on active service.
where the devil am l, anyway? -You're in Liverpool.
Liverpool?
you've had a nasty shock.
you better go somewhere and rest for a while.
try not to think about anything.
ls this the party who had the accident? -Yes, Officer.
it's not my fault. He slipped in the mud right in front of me.
ls that the right of it? -It's the truth, Captain.
I think so. -What cabby says is correct, Officer.
I saw the accident from my window there.
can I have your name, please, sir? -Rainier, Charles Rainier.
Rainier. Profession, sir? -Captain of the Wessex Regiment.
address, please.
the trenches, Arras.
I beg your pardon, sir?
random Hall, North Random, Surrey. -Thank you, sir.
you don't wish to lodge a complaint, sir?
thank you, no. I'm sure whatever happened was my fault.
all right. Thanks, Mr. Rainier.
Thanks, guvnor.
sure you feel strong enough to walk?
a little dizzy still, but I'll manage it.
quite a bump.
apart from that, what do I owe you?
never mind that. -Thank you.
Thanks. -It's all right, sir.
here's your hat. -Yes.
sure you don't want me to call a cab? -No, thanks. The air will brace me up.
by the way, would you mind telling me...
what day is this?
this is Thursday.
thursday, yes, but the date?
november 14, 1920.
Thanks.
1920. Three years gone.
three years.
france, I remember distinctly.
an ensign was killed. Young Davis. But after that?
what after that?
Liverpool? What am I doing here?
where have I been?
better go home. Yes. May clear things up. Better go home.
Mr. Sheldon, I'm sorry to wake you...
but there's a gentleman here asking for you.
he says he's Mr. Charles. Charles.
I'm sorry, Mr. Sheldon. That's what he says.
the butler says he'll come straight down, sir.
step inside, sir.
take a seat, sir.
you'll excuse me taking precautions, sir, it being late and all.
it's quite all right.
is Miss Bridget at home, do you know?
Yes, sir. The whole family's at home.
Really? Everything's all right up at the house, I hope.
haven't you heard, sir? Old Mr. Rainier died Sunday.
the funeral was today, sir.
was he a relative of yours, sir?
he was my father.
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't feel much like eating, but still. I must say I think it most peculiar.
after three years of complete silence...
he suddenly comes back from the grave with this cock-and-bull story...
...and at the very moment when the will is to be read.
very convenient, if you ask me.
you talk as if my brother were a fraud. -Who's to say he isn't?
you seem to forget Sheldon's seen him. -Yes, in the dark...
and Sheldon was probably half-asleep.
isn't this argument rather a waste of time?
and with all respect to Lydia...
I think we shall be able to recognize our own brother.
morning, everybody. -Good morning.
morning, Mother. -Morning, darling.
Where's Uncle Charles?
he's not down yet. Besides, we're not all deaf, dear.
I'm sorry. I'm just dying to see him. It's all so romantic...
like a thriller in the railway bookstore...
back From The Dead or The Disappearing Uncle.
Yes, or Three Years In Darkest Amnesia.
three years! Think of it.
where do you suppose he's been all that time?
that's just what I've been asking. In jail, for all we know.
did Truslove say positively that the will was written 10 years ago?
Yes, and I gather the estate is divided equally between all of us...
...with the exception of the two business interests...
and this house, which goes to Charles. -To Charles?
but why on earth should Charles get the house?
that gives him more than Chet, the eldest son.
morning, Uncle George. -Morning, Kitty. Morning, everybody.
morning. -I say, have you heard the news?
plenty for all and plenty more...
...when up-to-date methods are used in the handling of our various interests.
in fact, without being unduly optimistic, I think I may say...
sausages, by Jove!
but if the whole matter's gonna be treated as a joke
sit down, Chet. It's no joke to me.
that is, supposing it really is Charles who's suddenly turned up like a...
like a bad penny?
Hello, my dear fellow. How are you?
Hello, Chet. How are you? -Delighted to see you, Charles.
welcome home, darling. -Hello, darling.
Charles, this is Jolly. -My dear.
Charles, dear, how nice to see you.
you haven't met Henry yet, have you?
a new brother-in-law? How do you do? Congratulations.
thank you very much. -You remember Lydia.
how are you? -How are you?
Hello, old chap. -I'm Kitty.
Jill had to take me when she took Daddy.
how do you do, Kitty? Please sit down, all of you.
I'm afraid I'm upsetting your breakfast. -Here's a chair. Next to mine.
what can I get you? -You go on with your breakfast...
and I'll forage for myself. -Go ahead, my dear chap.
we're all absolutely delighted to see you back.
have to kill the fatted calf, what?
I'll settle for a couple of George's sausages.
if he's left any. -Plenty. I'm on a diet.
by Jove, he's kidding. Amazing. -They sound absolutely deafening.
by the way, my dear fellow, Truslove's reading the will this morning.
it's 10 years old, so you won't be done out of your share...
...which includes the house, I understand. -Really?
I'm sure you're all waiting for some sort of explanation.
I really haven't got one. That's what loss of memory does for you.
Sheldon's told you all I know.
I was in Liverpool yesterday morning.
why or how, I've no idea.
I'd been knocked down by a taxi and came to in a chemist's shop.
before that, I can't remember a thing.
since a shell hole in France, and that was three years ago.
those three years are a complete blank to me.
I don't know what I've done, where I've been.
I found a little money in my pocket and this key.
the key to your house?
if I knew that, I'd know where I belong.
you belong here, Uncle Charles. -Yes?
Yes, of course. This house.
I hope you'll all still think of it as home and come whenever you like...
and stay as long as you care to, now or anytime.
Charles-- -I shall come. Often.
I'm terribly glad you're my uncle. -Thank you, Kitty.
goodbye. -Goodbye, sir.
sorry you're leaving. -Well, Charles.
take care, old chap, won't you? Excuse my left hand.
Hello, Uncle Charles! I've come to say goodbye!
Hello, Kitty. You off, Julian? -Yes.
I don't think I shall call you uncle. You're not really my uncle.
forward minx. Goodbye, Charles. Let's meet again sometime, somewhere.
we must.
goodbye, young woman. -Goodbye.
let's sit down, shall we? Come on.
mother will be hours yet. She's always late.
can I have a puff of that cigarette?
do you think you should?
all the girls at Kerwood smoke as soon as they're in sixth.
you don't mind, do you? -Why should l?
Charles, aren't you going to be...
..terribly lonely all by yourself in this big house?
perhaps. Why?
only when people are lonely...
...they're rather apt to marry the first woman who comes along.
it doesn't do, you know.
it doesn't? - Never.
not once, in all your years of experience?
I shall be 18 in three years.
I'll keep you in mind. -Will you?
I know you're laughing at me...
but please don't do anything rash in the meantime...
because I do like you awfully, from the very first moment.
is this a leap year, by any chance?
I don't know, and I don't care.
I've said it and I mean it. -I'll have to think it over.
anyway, don't you think that I might come here in the holidays...
...and sort of take care of you?
what would Mother say? -Jill? She wouldn't mind.
she loves to get rid of me. -Kitty!
you'll write to me, won't you?
Kitty! -Will you?
all right, if you want me to.
here I am, waiting.
goodbye, Charles. Goodbye, Sheldon.
I've simply got to fly. -Goodbye, my dear.
lovely to see you. Come along, Kitty! -Goodbye.
goodbye, Kitty. -Goodbye, Uncle Charles.
thanks for asking me to come and visit you in the holidays.
will you be dining at home, sir? -Yes, I suppose so.
alone, sir? -There's no one else, is there?
I thought perhaps you might like to ask the vicar or Dr. Hampstead.
I don't think so, Sheldon. Thank you.
I'm afraid you'll be very lonely in this great house.
may one ask, sir, have you any plans for the future?
no. I might go back to Cambridge.
I never got my degree.
I might take a fling at writing. I always wanted to, if you remember.
I wonder what he would have liked me to do.
I think he always wanted you to carry on at Rainier's where he left off, sir.
but Mr. Chetwynd is head of Rainier's now.
Yes, now, sir, but... We shall see.
in any case, I'm not a businessman.
have you ever tried, sir? -No.
I wonder what I was doing in Liverpool.
dear Uncle Charles...
or "Dear Charles" .
what do you think?
he's not really my uncle, you know, and I have intentions.
dear Charles, so you've left Cambridge and gone into the business.
what a shame. I know you hated to leave your books...
...and that quiet corner of the river where Rupert Brooke used to dream.
mother says you're simply a wizard at it. We're all going to be rich again.
write to me soon.
l keep all your letters.
sentimental little college girl.
dear Uncle Charles.
dear Charles, I've graduated with honors.
I'm sending you my photograph in cap and gown.
will you put me on the desk in your study?
and please, look at me sometimes.
dear Charles... My dear Charles...
just to remind you that I'm growing up.
l have lots of beaus.
l do hope you're jealous.
by the way, I saw your picture in the paper.
l was impressed.
industrial Prince of England...
Mr. Charles Rainier.'
Hello, nuisance.
my word.
do you like it?
my dear, you look adorable.
adore me. I can bear it.
haven't I seen that hat before? -It's not a bad hat, is it?
it's a lovely hat.
now it will be a lovely lunch.
my dear, I cannot possibly afford the time. Come on.
Yes, you can. Miss Hanson says so.
she says it will do you good to get out of this office...
for an hour or two.
or two?
miss Hanson. -Yes, Mr. Rainier.
owing to lamentable weakness of character...
I'm having lunch at the Savoy with your approval.
I thoroughly approve. -You do.
I do, Mr. Rainier.
will you get me a copy...
...of the Brown-Severing prospectus while I'm out?
Yes, I will. -Have I any appointments for 2: 00?
Yes. -Can you postpone them?
Yes, I can. -Thanks.
all right, young woman...
I can give you precisely one hour and a half from door to door.
no. Miss Hanson said two hours.
thank you.
cigarette? -Please.
you're being very charming today. You haven't looked at your watch once.
that reminds me. -No, please. Can't you relax for an hour?
an hour? It's just on 3: 00.
you used to say that you hated business. -Did l?
you know you did.
you were going to whip things into shape and get out quickly.
that was the original idea.
to save the family and then be off before they needed more saving.
in that slow and careful way of yours? - I began to look into things, yes.
I found that Rainier's kept other families going, too.
little families in little homes. Thousands of them, all over England.
I see. Uncle Atlas, eh?
don't you ever want to get out and have fun?
Kitty, the last time l...
it's that woman you sent me, Lady Maxton.
one of the most interesting cases I've had...
since I have been in private practice.
well, goodbye.
goodbye, Lola, and don't forget that you're dining with me on Thursday.
goodbye.
what is it?
pardon me. It was nothing. It was just for a moment, that voice
was familiar? -Not that, exactly...
but it seemed to remind me of something that I didn't have time to get a grip on.
that happens to me sometimes.
a sort of wisp of memory that can't be caught before it fades away.
from those lost years? -Perhaps.
now, what were you saying?
that you should take a holiday. You've got money enough, heaven knows.
money, yes, but not the time. -That's nonsense.
you could make the time. How old are you?
none of your business.
you're awfully nice-looking, Charles. -Thank you.
clever, interesting.
it's not fair.
Why?
because you've spoiled me for other men, that's why.
Kitty.
it's no secret, is it? I've always been mad about you...
even as a schoolgirl.
it might be fun if you loved me now.
we're a lot alike, you know.
we laugh at the same things.
we have marvelous times together.
I sometimes wonder why you don't.
in my slow and careful way...
I've wondered sometimes, too.
why don't you? Just to be curious.
I haven't said that I don't.
Oh, no.
would it be too incredible?
it would be fantastic. -Then it is fantastic.
but I don't believe it. I don't believe that you mean it.
that you'll go on meaning it.
I shall wake up and find it isn't real at all.
it's just a dream. -No.
you do want me? I'm not just a schoolgirl to you?
darling, you're very sweet and dear to me.
I'm building a great hope on you.
I don't believe any of it.
at the office tomorrow, you'll have forgotten all about it.
I'll have Miss Hanson remind me.
Charles, darling, it's too wonderful.
take me out of here.
take me somewhere and kiss me.
yes? -Mr. Rainier, may I bring in
Yes, Miss Hanson. I'm sorry. Bring it in, please.
I've scribbled a note here. Will you take care of it? And this.
is the Ray-Novaille prospectus ready yet?
they promised it for 4: 00. I'll send it in as soon as it arrives.
you saw this offer from Harwood and Williams?
Yes, Mr. Rainier.
you worked for Harwood and Williams once, I believe.
they're driving a hard bargain.
do you think they're bluffing? -I think not.
I used to know Mr. Williams pretty well.
I was his secretary. -Yes. I remember he was quite annoyed...
...when you came to me. He called me a pirate.
that was not fair. It was really all my doing.
indeed?
I'd heard Miss Lindy was leaving you, and I applied for the position.
may I ask why?
a few weeks before, I'd come across a picture of you in a magazine.
underneath, it said, "Industrial Prince of England" .
dear me. -I was impressed.
I decided then I must leave Harwood and Williams to better myself.
I'm sincerely glad you did. You make things much easier for me.
what's all this?
that's the report on that firm in the Midlands.
the Melbridge Cable Company.
Yes, my brother thinks this would be a very valuable subsidiary.
I have a large file. Photographs of the works.
would you care to see it? -Please, yes.
bring me the Melbridge Cable Company report.
Yes, Miss Hanson.
hello.
Yes, I did, Mr. Manders. Can you make it 4: 30 this afternoon?
that would be splendid. He's very busy. Thank you.
market reports?
in 10 minutes, and thanks for the flowers. They're lovely.
I thought you'd like them.
thank you, Sheila.
their equipment's up-to-date.
and they seem to have plenty of space.
it does seem worth investigating.
I'll get my brother to run down.
I'm taking a long holiday.
are you? At once? - In about a month or so.
why, I think that's a very good idea.
I may be gone a year. If things can be arranged.
a year?
if it's humanly possible.
I'm being married, Miss Hanson.
you're the first to hear my news.
I'm afraid it'll mean a lot of extra work for you...
putting things in order so I can get away.
it's Miss Chilcet, I suppose. -Yes, it's Kitty.
was it so obvious? -Not at all. She's a very charming girl.
Yes, I fully agree.
I hope you won't take it into your head to follow my example, Miss Hanson.
I don't know what I should do without you.
I have been married, Mr. Rainier.
remember, I told you when I took the position.
Yes, to be sure. It slipped my memory.
you had a child, I believe.
Yes. A little boy. He died.
Yes. I remember. I'm sorry.
you'll see that Mr. Chetwynd gets this, will you?
and I'll let him have the file later.
Hello?
Yes, he's here. Miss Chilcet.
hello.
definitely. You want me to confirm it in writing?
you absurd young person.
what's that? No, Kitty. Of course not.
Paula, don't. -John, let me tell him.
that you're his wife? -Yes.
you can risk it, if you wish.
I hope you won't.
but what do I risk now?
what do you want of him, Paula? His name? His protection?
I want him as he was.
I want his love.
Paula, two years ago, you walked into his office.
if the sight of you did nothing to restore his memory...
what can words do?
when you came to me at Melbridge shortly after he disappeared...
I told you I was sure he hadn't deserted you knowingly.
I told you a door in his mind had opened, but another had closed.
I warned you even that if you found him...
the chances were he wouldn't recognize you.
you gave me a hope.
there's always that hope, but the impetus must come from within.
it can't be forced on him from outside.
you can tell him the truth and claim your legal rights.
but what is going to be his attitude when a strange woman appears...
and suddenly claims to be his wife?
he'd resent me.
he'd accept me.
he'd pity me...
and he'd resent me.
I can only offer you that frail hope that someday the miracle will happen...
and he'll come back to you, not as Charles Rainier, but as...
what was it you used to call him?
smithy. -As Smithy...
with all his emotion for you as warm and intact as it was...
...on the day he left you.
that's not much help to me, John, is it?
I'm real, these tears are real, and my jealousy is real...
and my need of him.
Paula, I wish I could help you.
what will you do?
I don't know. I'll have to think it out.
you go to your dinner. -I'll call it off if you'll dine with me.
no, don't do that.
dear John. Always firm, but kind.
thank you for the hope.
that is rather nice of me, seeing that it robs me of mine.
good night, John.
the law is quite clear on that point, Mrs. Smith.
if it is proved that for a period of not less than seven years...
no news of a person has been received...
,,,by those who would naturally hear of him if he were alive...
then he may be legally presumed dead.
you wish me to take the necessary steps?
please.
now, to complete the particulars.
did you prosecute a search?
Yes, we investigated accidents that had occurred on that day.
without result? -Yes.
then I became seriously ill.
I was ill for many months. My baby died.
as soon as I could get about, I made some effort to return to the stage...
but without success.
I worked as a waitress, a saleswoman.
I studied stenography at night school.
spent every penny I could spare trying to trace my husband.
thought he might have been taken to a hospital...
or perhaps an asylum.
but years passed, and I found no trace of him.
are you employed at present?
for the last two years, I've worked as a private secretary.
to whom? -To Mr. Charles Rainier.
I've studied your petition, Mrs. Smith...
and the affidavits attached.
in regard to the evidence presented, I have entered the decree to the effect...
...that the man known as John Smith shall be presumed to be dead...
and your marriage to him consequently dissolved.
Hello, you two!
I wish you'd remember you're getting married on Wednesday.
that odd little Mr. Beddoes has been waiting in the chapel for ages.
Oh, dear! How dreadful of me. I forgot. He wants us to choose the hymns.
we'll go down. Back in a few minutes. What's for tea?
muffins, old boy! Terrific!
that's nice.
I forget the words.
Yes, I remember now.
then there's another lovely one. Nearly always used.
this, perhaps: O Perfect Love.
Yes, that's it.
I like that. Don't you, Charles?
what is it, Kitty?
I'm sorry, darling. I must have been dreaming.
it's all right, Charles.
I'm glad it happened.
it's better. -Better?
what has happened?
I've been uncertain.
almost from the beginning.
now I'm sure.
it's no use, is it?
I've always known it. Really.
I was grasping selfishly at my own happiness.
because you could make me perfectly happy.
if I were selfish enough not to care...
or stupid enough not to know.
to know what?
that I'm not the one.
let's be honest about it.
I was letting things drift.
but I never really believed in my own luck.
Charles, you looked at me just now as if I were a stranger.
an intrusive stranger.
trying to take the place of someone else.
someone else?
I know it sounds absurd, but let me say it.
sometimes...
especially when we've been closest...
I've had a curious feeling that I remind you of someone else.
someone you once knew.
don't leave me, Kitty. I need you.
I'm trying to make a life.
with someone you love as you'll never love me.
I am nearly the one, Charles.
so nearly that I shall always be proud of it.
but nearly isn't enough for a lifetime.
it would be too hard to...
I've left it rather late, haven't l? I'm sorry.
I think I'll travel.
mother's going to Luxor, I believe. I'll go with her.
Kitty... -It's all right, Charles.
I asked for it, and I'll get over it.
one does, you know.
I shan't go in any tragic mood...
but looking to see what fun I can find, and I usually can.
you'll probably hear that I've married some nice man.
I don't know what to say.
you don't have to say anything.
but because I am so nearly the one...
and because I love you more than anyone I shall ever marry...
will you kiss me goodbye?
well, we can't keep this up indefinitely.
where in the devil is he?
no normal man walks out of a big concern without saying a word to a solitary soul.
everything was arranged. Could he have gone abroad?
he would have let us know. Confound that girl!
what the deuce could have happened?
one minute they were picking hymns for the wedding
Mr. Chetwynd? -What now?
I'm sorry, sir. It seems to be important. Stourton of the Lytham Liberal League.
all right, I'll see him. You talk to Sheldon.
Sheldon, when did you say you last saw Mr. Rainier?
it was close to dinnertime, miss. About an hour after Miss Kitty left.
Mr. Charles asked me to put some things into a bag for him.
I don't know quite why, miss...
but I sort of think that he may have gone to Liverpool.
to Liverpool? -Yes, miss.
it was from Liverpool he came that night...
...that he came back from the dead, as you might say.
please try to tell me everything you can remember about that night in 1920.
what did he tell you about what had happened to him?
well, miss, it was a wet night. In November, it was.
he'd been knocked down by a taxi and carried into a chemist's shop in Liverpool.
come in.
miss Hanson.
please forgive me for coming. We were all so anxious.
you're not well.
I should have let you know where I was. I intended to. I'm sorry.
I hate to bother you, but something very important came up.
how did you know I was in Liverpool?
something Sheldon said. I made inquiries. -Sheldon, yes.
won't you sit down, Miss Hanson?
you say some important business induced you to follow me?
sir Edward Lake, Member of Parliament from West Lytham...
died on Monday morning. There will be a by-election.
this morning, a committee of the West Lytham Liberal Association...
...unanimously decided to support your candidacy...
should you consent to stand in the Liberal interest.
did Sheldon tell you of my experience here about 12 years ago?
Yes, Mr. Rainier.
I came back here at that time...
hoping to stumble on the trail of my past...
but I failed then...
and I've failed now.
nothing helped you? -Nothing.
why should I feel a sense of loss so acute that...
that it's spoiling your life?
no, I'm not being honest with myself.
my life's not complete, and I've hurt others.
I don't know why I bore you with my affairs.
you feel that perhaps you lived in Liverpool?
it seems possible. -But not certain.
you mean I might have been visiting the city?
well, Liverpool's a big port.
I might have come in on some ship. Strange. That hadn't occurred to me.
or by train.
you might have come in from a nearby town...
or from the country.
perhaps on business. -Perhaps.
in that case, maybe you stayed at some hotel.
I know Liverpool. I've been up here often.
you know the direction you were walking in when the accident happened?
Yes, I checked that.
I was walking down Mason Street toward the square. It was wet.
well, there are two hotels north of Mason Street.
there's the old Olympic and the Great Northern.
it's quite a distance from the Olympic.
so, if it was wet, the chances are, you were coming from the Great Northern.
presuming I stayed at a hotel at all, under what name was I registered?
there's just one chance to find out.
if you were at a hotel, you walked out leaving unclaimed luggage.
would they keep it so long?
it's worth investigating. -Yes.
I'm glad you came, Miss Hanson. You've given me fresh hope.
you must come with me. We'll start with the Great Northern.
please be kind enough to tell the manager this suitcase is of no interest to me...
and I'm sorry to have troubled him.
John Smith.
highly unimaginative incognito.
what could be more anonymous than these poor rags?
nothing seemed familiar to you? -No.
there's a finality about that most unrewarding find:
like a door slammed and bolted.
now I shall learn to accept myself for what I am:
a psychological defective. As Kitty saw me. As you must see me.
you must keep my secret, Miss Hanson.
will you send a telegram to the West Lytham Liberal Association...
...telling them I'll receive the Committee tomorrow?
Yes, Mr. Rainier.
there's an express to London at 8: 15. -I'll make reservations.
congratulations, Mr. Rainier. Famous victory.
the Prime Minister's delighted. Our new member from Lytham.
Yes. Congratulations. -Thank you.
the party is honored, Mr. Rainier. -Thank you, sir.
Mr. Rainier, congratulations. -Thank you very much.
miss Hanson.
my compliments, Mr. Rainier. A great triumph.
thank you.
have I kept you waiting? I was delayed.
nice of you to come down for my debut.
was I satisfactory? -Very.
waiter, some tea, please.
what would you like? Cake? Sandwiches?
bring an assortment. -Thank you.
by the way, I haven't really thanked you for your help in the campaign.
I don't know what I should have done without you.
I thoroughly enjoyed it. Politics interest me.
do they? I'm glad of that.
you're staring at me, you know.
I'm sorry. It struck me your hair is bright red in the sunshine.
was that all? You were looking so intensely.
everyone has these feelings of having lived through certain moments before.
you mean, you have the feeling that you've known me before?
I had, for a moment.
as a matter of fact, I felt it quite strongly the first day you came into my office.
you didn't show it. -No?
ls that why you engaged me? -Perhaps.
it was also your air of quiet efficiency.
forgive me...
but is there any possibility that you might marry again?
not the slightest.
I'm asking you because I have a proposal to make.
I need your help in my parliamentary life.
social secretary? -Not exactly.
you know...
it seemed quite a reasonable idea when it came to me.
but now, I'm rather losing my nerve.
Why? Is it so startling?
it may sound outrageous to you, but it's not a sudden impulse.
I've thought it over very carefully.
you and I are in the same boat, Miss Hanson.
we're both ghost-ridden.
that sounds a bit romantic, but I think it expresses it.
we are prisoners of our past.
Yes.
what if we were to pool our loneliness...
and give each other what little we have: support, friendship?
I'm proposing marriage, Miss Hanson.
or should I call it a merger?
you know, I'm good at mergers.
a Member of Parliament should have a wife, Margaret.
so I'm told on all sides. "He needs a clever hostess.
you have exceptional gifts.
would it interest you to have a wider field for them?
you need have no fear that I would make any emotional demands upon you.
I have only sincere friendship to offer.
I won't ask any more from you.
please. Don't answer at once. Think it over.
it's completely a selfish proposal...
but I can't have you giving me notice, you know.
I'd be lost without you.
miss Hanson... Margaret...
have I hurt you? -I don't know.
this comes of boasting that I never cry.
you will think about it? I'll call you tomorrow.
no, I can't wait so long. Tonight, about 9: 00?
I hope the answer will be yes.
here's the tea.
it wasn't a very flattering proposal, really.
rather, a suggestion for a merger.
he used that very expression.
pretty cold-blooded, isn't it? -Well, it's honest.
I'm sorry. Sorry for myself.
I want you to be happy, Paula. - It may work out.
he might even fall in love with me.
would that be so very extraordinary?
it would be very extraordinary if he didn't.
but the situation is very extraordinary.
it seems rather hard, what I'm going to say...
but if you marry him, keep to his terms.
I suppose you're right.
and you love him?
Yes.
you're going to be hurt, Paula.
John, don't be against it.
Hello?
Yes, Mr. Rainier.
Charles. You're early.
it's yes, Charles.
isn't that Mrs. Rainier, who gives those political dinners?
lady Rainier. He was in the birthday honors.
they say he'll be in the Cabinet.
pity there's no son to inherit the title.
well, it's really amazing. She's got him to dance.
she's got him to smile, too. That woman is a marvel.
good night, Sheldon, and thank you. You managed beautifully.
thank you, milady.
thank you, Sheldon. -Good night, Mr. Charles.
you certainly mellowed the old gentleman.
he was positively purring when I put him into the car.
Yes, I think he really enjoyed himself.
I know I did. -Nonsense.
good heavens! It's nearly 3: 00. You have two committees tomorrow.
today. -Yes, that's true. It's nearly morning.
the morning of May 25. Does that suggest something to you?
it's the anniversary of our wedding. Our third anniversary.
will you wait just a moment? You don't look the least bit tired.
all my gratitude goes with this, Margaret.
I owe you more than I can put into words.
it's too beautiful, really. You spoil me.
the emerald is said to have belonged to the Empress Marie Louise.
Really? That's thrilling.
will you put it on for me?
there. How do you like it?
do you know you're a very beautiful woman?
thank you. I rather hoped you thought that.
Margaret...
are you happy?
why do you ask? -A twinge of conscience.
if I hadn't interfered in your life-- -I should have never been Lady Rainier...
...entertained the Prime Minister, worn a queen's emerald.
is it enough?
perhaps not.
is there anyone else?
no.
Charles, why are you asking me? -Because if there were...
I've often wanted to say this, I wouldn't hold you to our bargain.
I haven't the right.
you're trying to get rid of me, Charles? -You know I'd be utterly lost without you.
I'm glad to hear that, because I like my job.
a woman told me tonight that she envied me more than anyone she knew.
she envied me my husband, Charles.
most women do.
now I really am tired.
good night, Charles, and thank you for the wonderful present.
good night, Margaret.
Smithy!
Margaret, I'm afraid I said something to hurt you.
no, Charles.
if I expressed myself clumsily...
it's nothing, really. It's just that... -I wish you would be frank with me.
do you?
were those a gift?
Yes.
I came across them quite by chance.
they're just cheap little beads.
but they have a value for you that this does not?
he said they were the color of my eyes.
they are, aren't they?
Oh, Margaret.
isn't there something morbid in burying one's heart with the dead?
that's a strange thing for you to say. -ls it?
you haven't even a memory.
no.
and the best of you...
your capacity for loving...
...your joy in living is buried in a little space of time you've forgotten.
it isn't quite the same thing. -Why not?
because in some vague way, I still have...
hope? -Yes, I suppose that's it.
have you, Charles?
do you feel that there really is someone?
that someday you may find her?
I'd rather not talk of it, Margaret.
it's nothing I could put into words.
but doesn't it frighten you sometimes...
that the years are passing...
that you may sometime find that you've lost your capacity for happiness?
you may have come so near her.
you may even have brushed by her in the street.
you might even have met her, Charles.
met her and not known her.
it might be someone you know.
Charles, it might even be me.
Oh, Margaret.
I know I'm talking wildly.
it's after 3: 00, and I'm tired. -Yes.
I've sometimes thought I'd like to travel. I feel I need a change and a rest.
to travel? -Yes. I've never been out of England.
I'd like to go to Buenos Aires or Rio or somewhere colorful and distracting.
perhaps when the House adjourns
I don't want to drag you away. I'll take a maid. Or a friend, perhaps.
Margaret, I believe you want to get away from me.
no.
it's just that it's been a strain.
I'm just a little nobody, you know. It's been harder than I thought...
...being the wife of Charles Rainier.
if you wish, of course.
you are a little overtired, I think.
shall we talk about it in the morning? - In the morning, yes.
good night, Margaret. - Good night, Charles.
smithy.
I think this is my compartment.
Yes, it is.
I hope Harrison has made everything smooth for you.
Thanks. Yes, he's been very helpful.
he should be here any moment with my letter of credit.
will you have only two days in the country?
Yes. My boat sails on Wednesday.
it's on your way, this place. -No. It's in Devon.
it's a quiet little country village...
...with a delightful old inn. I wanted to see it again.
I was once very happy there.
I'm glad I'm not late. Hello, sir.
I made you out an itinerary. I thought you'd like to study it on the ship.
how kind of you.
here's your letter of credit. -Thank you.
and some magazines. I'll put these in the compartment.
I think you'll find everything in order.
I hope you have a wonderful trip. -Thank you.
don't stay away too long.
if I do, blame your excellent arrangements.
goodbye. -Goodbye.
I'll wait for you, sir. I have a message from Mr. Chetwynd.
well, goodbye, Charles.
Margaret, I wish you weren't going.
I don't feel quite happy about it.
you'll let me hear from you? -Of course.
goodbye.
you're going to the house? -No, to the office. There's some trouble.
seems strange not to talk it over with you, Margaret.
this strike, sir, it's pretty serious.
strike?
at the Melbridge Cable Works. The men are out of hand.
Melbridge. Yes, of course.
it's all right, men. We've got our terms.
the strike is settled, and we've won!
thanks to one man:
sir Charles Rainier!
first back streets we came through.
here. Let's pop in here for a whiskey and soda.
thank you kindly, sir. We appreciate it.
what will you have, gents? -Two double McWhirters and soda, please.
two double Macs. Right-o, sir. Here we are, sir.
is that the proprietor?
Yes, sir. That's the Biffer. Was, I should say.
he ain't much like that now. That's him at the end.
he was a gentleman, the gunner was.
not like these softies what call theirselves heavyweights today.
why, he'd take two of them for breakfast!
he didn't wear no fancy dressing gown...
well, we mustn't lose our train. We better go.
thank you, sir.
the fog's getting thicker. -Yes. Beastly.
cigarette? -Sorry. I don't smoke.
of course not.
never mind. There's a little tobacconist just around the corner.
well?
packet of Barclay Blue Ribbons, please. -Yes, sir.
thank you, sir. -Thank you.
good night, sir. -Good night.
I thought you said you'd never been in Melbridge.
I haven't.
but you said, "There's a little tobacconist just around the corner.
you said, "There's a little tobacconist just around the corner" .
I said that?
that shop was off the main street.
you couldn't have seen it on your way from the station.
no.
then how did you know of it?
I don't know. -You went straight to it.
I did know, but I don't know how.
Melbridge. -What's the matter?
Melbridge.
are you ill, sir? Let me get a cab.
no, let me think. There's something.
that shop...
that woman.
there's a taxi. I'll get it.
here you are, sir.
where is the hospital?
you mean the old one or the new one, sir?
the old one, I think.
it's on a hill.
big gates...
a high wall all around it.
that don't sound much like either of them.
you wouldn't be meaning the asylum, would you, sir?
look here, sir.
you say you came out of these gates?
Yes. I'm sure of that.
there was some excitement and a great deal of noise.
then let's start from here.
try and retrace your steps.
now.
you must have gone into town.
Yes, I'd been to that shop.
perhaps as we go, you can piece the thing together.
Yes, that's right. That's a good idea.
I came along this path.
you remember that? -Yes, I think so.
there was a good deal of fog...
and people shouting, and the sound of...
like I was trying to get away from something...
...trying to escape.
there was some danger, and I was afraid.
I was...
there was a girl.
Yes, there was a girl!
the mist is lifting.
Yes. It looks as if it will be a nice day after all.
could you take the luggage to the station and wait for me?
I've lots of time. I think I'd like to walk.
right you are, ma'am. I'll wait for you by the newsstand.
you're leaving us now? I do hope you'll come and see us again.
not very soon, I'm afraid.
I'm sailing for South America at 2: 00. -You are? My, I envy you.
are you sure you'd prefer to walk to the station?
Yes. Such a pretty walk.
I used to live here, you know, years ago.
Mrs. Deventer's time. Did you know her?
so Albert was telling me.
she was quite a character, Mrs. Deventer. Lots of people ask after her.
there was a gentleman in here a few minutes ago...
asking after Mrs. Deventer and the old vicar.
Really? I should be going. I don't want to have to hurry.
goodbye, Miss Barnes. Thank you.
I'm sure you'll have a wonderful trip. -Thank you.
did you say a gentleman was asking for Mrs. Deventer?
Yes, miss, and the old vicar.
that's Mr. Durham, you know. He lives at Seven Oaks.
Mr. Pauly's our vicar now.
ls the gentleman staying here? -No.
he was looking for a cottage. Said he used to rent one here years ago.
he remembered it was near the church.
was he a friend of yours, miss?
excuse me.
Smithy?
Oh, Smithy!
darling!
Paula!
where are you, Charlie? More importantly, where is my money?
you're into me for 30 grand. - Jack, I'm going to pay you.
this ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.
you owe Jack money, too? Charlie, you pay me first!
bill. We're good, buddy. I got your money. It's right here in my hand.
why don't we meet up on the...?
your phone's going all screwy. Hello? - I'm losing you.
I can't hear what you're say...
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?
Yeah. - Can we see him?
you want to see him? - Yeah.
give me a minute.
this...
..is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.
what robot is he fighting? - Actually he's going to fight...
whoa, little lady. What are you doing?
can we get a picture with him?
sure. For five dollars.
you want five dollars? Seriously?
no, I want five dollars immediately.
come on, guys.
all right, I'm kidding. Three bucks. - Whatever.
how about $2. 50? - You suck!
it's going to be one of those towns, huh?
welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.
please take your seats. We're almost ready to get this thing started.
I was told my bot was fighting an 800-pound steer.
that is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time has not been good to you, my friend.
Ricky, we got a big problem here. - Slow down there, hoss.
last time I saw you, you were staring at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center with the taste of my right cross all over your face.
are we good to go here? - Yeah.
we agreed that my boxer would fight an 800-pound steer for three grand.
am I right? - Yes, sir. We did.
that bull is like 2, 000 pounds.
I'll tell you something.
your bot don't fight, you don't get paid! How about that?
get the hell out of here.
why don't we make this more interesting. My bot against your bull, straight up.
how much? - Twenty grand, winner takes all.
twenty grand. You got 20 grand? - In a safe in my truck.
all right, Charlie.
twenty grand it is, but if you lose and you welch,
I'll come after you and beat you to within an inch of your life.
you know that I can do that because I already done done it!
what's your problem? In life you get too close, in the ring you stand back like a girl. Just shake.
all right. Shake and pow! Just like that once again. You want to dance again?
cheer for this guy. Give him some luck. He needs some luck.
don't touch that bull.
ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask, do we have any fans of robot boxing here today?
now, listen, friends, I understand we can't all afford to go all the way over there to Dallas and pay $300 for one of those World Robot Boxing League fights.
so, I decided that I would bring a robot boxing match right here to our little fair here in San Leandro.
how about that?
ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you,
ambush!
let's do it!
all right, big fella.
he's a big fella, ain't he?
take a turn. Let them see how beautiful you are.
show them some power.
look at that. He's getting all kungfu on us.
Yeah, big fella.
Ambush's opponent today, he's last year's runner-up in the baddest of the bulls competition, ladies and gentlemen,
black Thunder!
let's get it on! - Let's get this thing started.
is that all you got?
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.
take him, take him.
ambush lays the smackdown on that prime beef.
I got more for you, big fella. We're just getting started.
OK. Jump, now!
ambush, decks Black Thunder, but when you mess with the bull, you're going to get the horns.
you like that. I can tell. You like that.
Jesus. Turn around!
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!
come on. We're still in this thing. Just hop. Hop.
that's it. Come on.
Ricky, enough! Enough!
I can't hear you over the sound of your robot being destroyed.
kill!
come on, get up.
get up! Come on!
No!
come on, no. No, no, no!
ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for our warriors out here today at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.
thank you for coming out, and we'll see you next time, because there will be one.
give me that leg.
sure. For five dollars.
boo-yah!
all right! That was ridiculous fun, now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?
I'm going to come by for my money, Charlie boy. You best have it.
everybody say "hey!" - Hey!
everybody say "ho!" - Ho!
how about that? How you doing there, little robot?
my keys, damn it.
one more step and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.
Charlie, relax.
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus fight. It cost me my last robot.
just listen to us. - Do you recall Caroline Fallon?
she's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen her in ten years. What does she want?
nothing. She died.
do you recall Max Kenton?
he's my son. He's got to be nine.
eleven. - Eleven. OK.
is he dead, too?
no, he's fine. That's why we're here.
this court is convened to address the custodial status of one Max Kenton, age 11.
mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased. Father, Charles Kenton.
Debra Fallon Barnes, you're the boy's aunt.
Yes. As I've already told you, my husband, Marvin, is wealthy, and we can more than provide for Max.
I appreciate that, but per Texas state law, without a written will next of kin retains custody.
Charles Kenton, who is aware of this custody hearing, and we are expecting him...
I need a new robot now.
I had a big fight for Ambush next Saturday.
I got to show up with something.
noisy Boy is for sale? In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.
how much? That's a good deal. What's wrong with him?
I can live with that.
I don't have it.
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights to custody right after the boy was born.
I can more than provide for Max.
please be Charles Kenton.
Charlie, yeah.
I'm here to sign some paper that releases my rights to the custody of my son.
that's why I'm here. Do I need to be here?
Charlie.
do you even remember me?
Debra, Caroline's sister. - Yeah, Debra. How are you?
Mr. Kenton. Please take a seat.
your Honor, may I please go and see my nephew now?
Yes, you may.
how about you, Mr. Kenton? - What?
you can spend some time with him, if you'd like.
with the kid? - Yeah, the kid.
Max. Your son? - All right.
you've been working with those robots for so long, you've become one.
honey, you wait right here. I'm going to be back.
you take all the time you need, sweetheart.
your Honor, I'd like to, at this juncture, step out and call my attorney, if that's all right.
please.
come on. Come on. There you are.
he'll be in a foster home.
no, they find good families. Young. Energetic. Yeah.
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.
Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband. - Right, yeah.
Debra really wants to adopt Max.
I'm up for it. But... - Seventy-five grand.
$75, 000? You're serious?
the thing is...
we're supposed to go to Italy this summer with my oldest friend and his wife.
two months in Tuscany and all over.
just the four of you. Sounds nice.
we'll be back in New York by the end of August.
in August. A hundred.
$100, 000? - You heard me.
you're crazy. - Not nearly as crazy as your wife if you tell her I just signed over that kid to the state of Texas.
there's a real way everyone gets what they want here.
so here's what you're going to do.
you're going to tell your wife I'll only sign over custody to her if I get to spend the summer with the kid first.
just tell her how guilty she made me feel for being such a terrible absentee dad, how I want to make good with junior, a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.
she'll buy it, you get to be the hero and everybody wins.
OK. But not a word about the money to Debra, you understand?
I understand.
I'll give you 50 grand tonight when we drop off Max and the other 50 when we get back in August and you deliver him to us in New York.
pleasure doing business with you.
your Honor, I'm happy we all took the time to make the best decision for everyone.
happy? - Yeah, it's me.
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.
take him to Tallet's Gym and I'll meet you there.
Hello?
Bailey?
some guy is here with the robot you're buying,
I gotta tell you Charlie, it smells like disaster to me.
nice to see you, too.
might I also say how cute you look. - Give it up.
God, I need a shower. You want to take a shower? Come on.
let me make something clear.
a creepy dude with a robot in a box has been sitting outside my gym for two hours.
putting aside the fact that you're doing what I'm guessing is a black market deal on my doorstep, how will you pay him when Ambush just got destroyed?
the money is on its way. Just distract him.
I have been. It's exhausting.
you're the best. - Yeah? Really?
is that why you're buying a $45, 000 robot when you owe me six grand in rent?
because I'm the best? - Three.
six. Listen, there is a guy with real money who wants to buy this place.
come on. Like you're really going to sell your dad's gym.
if you don't make rent, I can't make payments and I won't have a choice.
your father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass - if you sold this place. - My father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass.
Bailey?
don't. - Don't what?
don't do that.
don't what? - Don't do that thing.
no, you like that thing. - No.
Yeah. - No, I don't like that thing.
I used to. Once. Briefly. Now I like money more.
I don't believe you. - I don't care.
Marvin.
your money has arrived.
Marv.
fifty grand, as promised.
here are all our numbers and contact info over in Europe.
so that's everything there.
so Marvin tells me you want this time with Max.
Yeah. - You did the right thing, giving me custody.
Caroline would have wanted that.
now, have him back in New York on August 27th.
that's a deal.
OK, let's go get Max. OK? Let's get Max.
it's OK. You want to go around the other side here and I'll get Max?
Hey. Max. See you, pal.
Max, we'll see you at the end of the summer, honey.
I'm Charlie.
it's been a long time. You know, I'm your...
you screwed me. - Nice mouth.
do you know where they're going?
Italy? - Yeah, Italy.
so how did I get stuck here with you?
relax, kid. You got a whole life of fine living ahead of you.
Charlie!
dude's pissed. He's going to take off.
did Marvin give you that money? - Here, just close the deal.
I'll be right there, OK?
I'm Bailey. - Max.
Max Kenton.
so this is your... - Yeah, it's him.
don't worry about it, OK?
I'm looking at you two and...
just go and put Noisy in the shop, please? Thank you.
you're going to stay here with her while I'm on the road.
how much did he give you? - You're coming at this the wrong way.
no, tell me. I want to know.
fifty thousand, OK?
he gave me $50, 000 to sign you over to her.
will you shut up now?
you sold me?
sounds worse than it is.
really. - It's to take care of you.
give me half the money and you won't have to.
where are you going to go? - Give me the money. I'll be fine.
I told your aunt I'll get you to New York at the end of the summer.
now you're concerned for Aunt Debra?
you sold me for 50 grand. You owe me half!
I don't have it! I spent the money on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!
I'm through here.
what do we got?
noisy Boy has arrived.
that's a lot of airline stickers and customs tags.
he's been all over the world. - London, Japan, Brazil, San Paulo...
hasn't seen North American soil in over two years.
maybe that's why you got such a good price, genius.
decided to stay?
this is Bailey. She'll be looking after you for a few weeks.
by the way, I need you to look after the kid for a few weeks.
I want half that money. - Are we back to this again?
is there a real robot boxer in there?
noisy Boy's in there. You ever heard of him?
of course. He fought Rubicon for the WRB belt in 2016.
holy crap, he looks amazing.
his composite armor has been replaced. Let's see if the insides look as good.
I've watched that fight with Rubicon like 20 times.
he should have had him in the third round, but Rubicon got lucky with a huge right and ended it.
relax, kid, he's on our side.
not funny. - Kind of funny.
you know he has voice recognition, right?
no, he doesn't. - He didn't in the League.
when Noisy fought in Brazil, they must have put it in.
brazilians are crazy about that talk-to-your-robot crap.
right, left, uppercut!
doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!
I knew that price was too good to be true. We got screwed.
give me a second. Let me see if I can fix it. - Look how good he looks, too.
give me two seconds. Let me look at something!
why didn't you ask to look at it? - Relax!
was that Japanese?
let me see if I can reset him to English.
how do you know Japanese?
video games.
you play video games in Japanese?
japanese bootlegs are always better.
give me that.
he's reset to English, and I found his command matrix.
they have pre-loaded a bunch of combinations.
they should be listed here.
top salvo!
what did I tell you?
gravity One Downtown!
I was due for some good luck!
you're welcome. - Thank you.
Bailey, help me put him in the truck. I am going to go and get your money.
give me the keys. - I'm coming with you.
no, you're not. - Why not?
because I don't want you with me, OK?
I'm either coming with you, or you're fishing for your keys in the sewer.
your choice. What's it going to be, old man?
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?
don't do that again. - That's scaring you, isn't it?
don't do this again?
get in. Just get in. Give me the keys first.
wait till I get in the truck. Thanks, Big Pops.
sweet ride.
put on your seatbelt and don't talk.
I'm taking all bets!
keep up. Stay close.
Charlie Kenton is in the house!
all right, all right. - Come on, man!
is that Noisy Boy? - The one and only.
that's Noisy Boy!
Noisy's been in Japan. Softer bots over there.
sure you want to fight him tonight? - What do you got?
he can take any bot in this place. You know it.
you can have any undercard you want.
five thousand guaranteed.
a thousand every round your bot survives.
fight till the death!
no. Give me the main event.
come on. - This is Noisy Boy.
an original Tak Mashido bot.
he was a World Robot League boxer. Come on!
you want to fight Midas?
fifty thousand guaranteed, winner takes all.
fifty? Really, 50? Now you're talking.
listen, listen. No, look.
listen! - Give me a sec.
we should take an undercard fight, make a little cash and get out of here!
first, there is no "we.
second, he's going to crush Midas, and I'm going to make real cash!
we'll take Midas!
tonight, our main event features the gold-blooded killer!
this pimped-out punk is programmed for pain!
I give to you the mighty Midas!
against a bot who ran with the big boys in the WRB!
he's been on an exile tour overseas, but now he's back home, and he's ready to make some noise!
take your first look in a long time at Noisy Boy!
crash Palace, who's ready for some destruction?!
let's make some money! Come on!
we have Midas against Noisy Boy.
noisy Boy against Midas.
you've been waiting all night for this matchup, Crash Palace!
scimitar right!
did you see that?
easy money, easy money all night. All night long!
come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!
skull salvo! Firefight!
Yeah! Go, Noisy! - Undercard, huh?
Shockfist!
get in there. Shogun Trinity!
let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!
this son-of-a-bitch is crazy!
full Metal Feud! Bring it!
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!
I got something for you.
don't you run from me! You can't run from me!
get up!
that's illegal!
this is the underworld. There are no rules!
now we're seeing the Midas touch.
no. Hands up!
get back in that corner, bitch, and take this whooping like a man!
he's getting killed in there!
it's a headset! You talk into it and you tell him what to do!
panic Shield!
that's it. One-Two Overlord!
no, no. Shatter Punch!
five Recall! - Get some!
jab, jab!
right roundhouse!
did he just spit his juice in Midas's face?
no, you did not spit in Midas's face!
it's party time now, Crash Palace!
use your left!
Noisy's trying to do something with his one arm!
but Midas pins him, and Daddy goes to work!
no, no! Get up!
get some!
move! Get out of the corner!
Midas! Midas! Midas!
somebody's ready to serve up a decappuccino!
I got something for you! You ready?
good night! That's a home run for Midas.
and so long to Noisy Boy.
that sucked. You hungry?
I saved what's left of Noisy's voice recognition board.
other than that, he's trash. I got to get a new robot together.
I need to find a mainframe. What?
I hate hamburgers. - What kid hates burgers?
fine. More for me. Here, drink this.
you never should have taken that fight.
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.
do you even think about the stuff you do before you do it?
you had no idea how to fight that fight.
those combination codes, you didn't know what half of them even meant.
you threw them in there cocky and half-assed.
you never gave him a chance. - He wasn't that good.
noisy Boy was a great robot.
was. Was a great robot back in the League, back in the day.
but look around you. This place is where once great robots go to die.
so throw him away.
that's what you do, right? Anything you don't need you throw away.
Wow.
it's been a long night.
if you want to sleep indoors tonight, shut up and get in the truck.
don't look at me like that way. Get in the truck!
they gave me 400 for his head.
you stay put. I'm going to look for parts.
I'm coming with you. That drink has my heart pounding.
if I sit in this truck by myself, my head will explode.
whatever. Just keep up.
crap.
stay back.
all right, keep up.
these searchlights are automated, but you got to time them right, so stay close.
it's all right.
come on, come on.
we're going to get caught. - Come on.
easy, easy. Easy, easy.
quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!
robots are on the east side. We got to be quick in here.
once we're through here, there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!
here it is. - What are we looking for?
anything I could use to put a fighting bot together.
Hey, look. - What?
it's so small.
Yeah. That's before your time.
that's a Generation One, the very first fighting bot.
they wanted them to look like us. The more human, the better.
crazy how quick everything changed. Put that in the cart.
what changed? - A good question. Human boxing.
it just faded. - Why?
because the money moved on. People wanted more carnage, more show.
you had the whole Brazilian underground, the Gracies, the Machados, jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and a thousand styles in between.
full-on ground-and-pound.
look at this. - What's that?
I don't know.
not bad. Good spot.
you still had human fighters, human bodies, so you couldn't give the people what they really wanted:
true, no-holds-barred violence.
the next logical step, get the humans out of there and let the machines kill each other.
do you miss it?
boxing. Do you miss it? - Careful.
what? I want to know.
careful, you're on a cliff.
that's a long way down. If you fell, you'd definitely...
Charlie, help me!
Charlie!
Charlie! - Max! Max!
Max!
try not to move! - I'm on some sort of robot arm.
wait! Just easy, easy. Give me your hand. Nice and easy.
very slowly. Good. Don't look down. Look at me. Look at me.
that's it! I've got you! You don't have to be scared. I got you!
it's so far! - It's OK. I got you.
give me your other hand. Nice and slow.
just give me your other hand very slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!
look at me. We're going to do this together.
you and me. Just look at me. That's it.
one... two... three!
that's it. I got you! I got you. I got you. I got you.
you're safe. You're safe.
all right, I got you.
you all right? - Yeah.
come here. Easy. Easy.
you all right?
you all right? - Yeah.
I told you it was dangerous.
careful. We're still on the edge here.
Charlie, I think there's a whole robot in there.
so what? Let's go. Come on.
I'm taking him with me. He saved my life.
he did not save your life. I saved your life. Let's go.
just bring the cart to the edge. I'll use the winch to get him out.
you want that piece of junk? You get the cart yourself. I'm through here.
this is what's left of Noisy Boy?
that's it.
his head does make a nice addition to the front of the Crash Palace.
it's not funny. - Let's get a robot, you and me.
good idea. You're broke. I'm almost there myself.
you destroyed the best shot you had. - We'll put one together.
you're brilliant at this. There's good stuff here.
there's nothing here. - There is. Look.
all your junk is... it's junk.
you're not even in the game anymore.
it's all garbage. - I heard you. It's garbage.
don't get loud with me.
you're your problem. - What's that supposed to mean?
I have been here for you a long time.
in the ring, out of the ring, and the whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.
my father invested everything he had in your fight career. We loved...
he loved you like family. And this is his home.
I'm just trying not to let it die. That's my plan.
what's yours?
you're done, right?
you're finally done? Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.
I got nothing left.
all right.
maybe there's something here.
this robot the kid brought in last night. Would you look at it for me?
please?
I've never seen anything like it before. He's Generation Two, but barely.
I found a power cell that fits him, and I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.
you can move him around, but he's crap.
maybe I can get a sparring gig for him, make a few hundred bucks.
stop.
it's my robot!
it took me half the night dragging him out of there. He's mine.
he's yours? Yeah. But the parts we're putting in him are mine!
you idiots should see if he powers up before you fight over him.
what happened to you?
watch out. Stay back.
looks like he's got a shadow function. That's pretty rare.
he can mime your movements and store them in memory.
is there anything here we could use? - Not much.
there's a bucket...
there's a bucket I use to wash the truck.
use it and clean him up. He smells like crap.
wash yourself off, too, while you're at it. You stink.
I switched him to remote. It's pretty basic.
just use the toggles here to steer him and walk him.
you play video games, right? - Of course.
same idea, only this one's a thousand-pound robot.
cool.
atom.
his name is Atom. Can we get him a fight?
I don't think he was ever a boxing robot.
he's a G-2, built in early 2014. He was a sparring bot.
they must have built robots like this one that could mirror the fighting style of any other robot.
OK, so can we get him a fight?
are you not listening? He's a sparring bot.
built to take a lot of hits, but never dishing out any real punishment.
you could always sell him off for parts.
can't you get him a fight? - Why can't you get him a fight?
God, you don't quit, do you?
you want me to put him in some bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?
I saw how scared you were at Crash Palace.
the places that would let you fight this robot would make you pee your pants.
excellent. Get him a fight.
stubborn kid.
surprise, surprise.
let's take a walk.
can you understand me?
don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
you've known Charlie a long time.
too long. We both kind of grew up in this gym.
my dad, he trained him.
that's them. That's Charlie.
what was he like? - As a boxer?
as anything. - He was something.
he was lean, tough.
no quit, no fear.
come here. I want to show you something.
I have this newspaper article from Phoenix 2007
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy, the top contender.
you were at the Nico Tandy fight?
I was. Charlie was supposed to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.
Nico wasn't even supposed to break a sweat, but...
...nobody told Charlie that, so he just kept coming and coming at him.
check this out.
that's Charlie.
first, Nico couldn't believe the balls on this nobody.
but Charlie kept coming, and that's when Nico looked scared.
Really? - Really.
he was toying with Nico.
the top contender, number two in the world, and Charlie was dancing with him.
Charlie was floating inches off the canvas that night.
he was like a ghost. Nico couldn't even see him.
I could.
he was beautiful.
he was beautiful.
so what happened? Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?
no, Nico Tandy put me on my ass in the 12th round. Twice.
second time for good. Lights out.
you were ahead on the scorecards - going into the 12th round. - Nico Tandy rung my bell and went on to be the undefeated world champ for the next three years.
he knocked you out? - Yeah. So did a lot of guys.
you knocked a lot of guys out, too.
24 and 19. It's not exactly a career. - But every fight a knockout.
Yeah. - Win or lose, fight's not over - till someone's on the mat. - Till someone's on the mat.
your old man taught me that. - Damn straight he taught you that.
who else did you fight? - Go get your stuff together.
I don't need to. Did you fight for the title?
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.
Wow. Here.
keep it.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
I like that kid.
he likes you.
what I said yesterday was... - No, nothing more to say.
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight to see if I can get a partner or raise money to get a new bot.
that's what you wanted, right? Me gone?
Yeah, that's what I wanted.
OK.
look.
the champ is here. Zeus is here.
Yeah.
Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds with this monster. Two rounds!
the champ puts his Real Steel world championship belt on the line tonight.
he just may have a real fight on his hands.
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time. Ever. End of story. Good night!
so cool. It's so cool. - What?
come on.
listen up. I got to go find Finn.
I want you to stay in this area, OK? - OK.
out of the way. Champ coming through. Zeus coming through.
move, move. Champ coming through.
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind the father/daughter Zeus team.
they say your father's the money and you are the mind behind Zeus.
you're very kind, but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus belongs to the great Tak Mashido.
what did it take to lure the reclusive genius, former boy wonder and arguably the most important bot designer in the history of the sport out of retirement?
why don't you ask him yourself?
is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?
Zeus is autonomous and constantly evolving during a fight.
with his adaptive operating system, he recognizes patterns and rewrites his fight code instantaneously.
for myself and Joe Sixpack out there, are you saying that Zeus...
I'm saying that no matter what happens in that ring...
the result of any fight is inevitable.
what Zeus sees...
he kills.
sweet.
I'm never going into business with you.
I just need a break here, Finn, come on.
you got that old bot truck out there. You always got something in there.
I got an old G-2 sparring bot, ain't worth the paint left on it.
what am I supposed to do with that?
the Zoo. Take him to the Zoo. They fight there tomorrow.
even I wouldn't be caught dead at the Zoo.
Finn, I just need a little loan.
what?
you're serious, Charlie? - A loan.
couple hundred. Few hundred. Whatever you got.
you know I'm good for it.
I know you, man, and as much as I like you, dude...
you're a bad bet, brother.
right, yeah.
did you see that? That's what's left of Axelrod.
where you been? I told you to stay put.
you should have seen him. Zeus was, like, amazing!
amazing, huh? - Unbelievable, yeah.
he was just peppering Axelrod with punches, but so fast. It was incredible.
axelrod didn't even land a punch. He didn't even survive the first round.
is that what you think boxing is?
Zeus beating up some piece of steel that they feed him?
axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
and that is what boxing is now. Deal with it.
and I love it, and I'm in it now.
you're in it now, are you? You and your G-2 sparring bot?
he's more than that. If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.
you're in luck, kid. There's a lovely place called the Zoo.
tomorrow afternoon, you'll get your fight.
great. - And it will be the end.
I told you I hate hamburgers!
it's a burrito!
right uppercut.
left uppercut.
bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.
again. Bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.
you been up all night?
Yeah. I cleaned him up.
I'm using shadow mode to program some fight moves and sync them to the remote.
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch you were showing him.
that's lethal stuff.
let's do this.
let's do breakfast first.
you know you're bringing him home in pieces, right?
we'll see.
let me deal with this. - Charlie Kenton. This is Max.
kingpin. Call me Kingpin.
all right, Kingpin, so... - How much a round?
what's this, we on a field trip?
all right. He can fight my robot Metro.
I'll give you a hundred bucks for one two-minute round.
take it. - Three hundred.
one hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to give you $100 just to get in with Metro.
how about 500 for two rounds?
two rounds. Son, he ain't going to survive one round.
what if he does? - He ain't.
let's just say he does.
if he's still standing after one round...
I'll give you a thousand bucks.
shut it!
but if he dies in there, which he will, junior...
I get to keep what's left.
take the hundred.
deal.
we're on. We on!
let's go!
you should have taken the hundred. - I got us a thousand.
Yeah, if he wins.
you want me to drive?
he's my bot. I got this!
this ain't a video game. This is for real. Right here.
you said he's coming home in pieces. What difference does it make?
all right.
I got this.
let's get it on! Let's get it on!
let's get it on like Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!
give me a bell! Give me a bell!
don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent. Watch him.
watch out for that foot. He's looking to pin you.
I told you to watch for that foot plant. Come on.
here comes the sledgehammer.
did you see that?
come on! Get him! - Don't yell at him, control him.
slip right. Back step.
duck.
you're welcome. - Shut up! You're not helping!
actually, I think I am.
backhand. You got speed on this guy. Just keep moving. Bob.
slip out of that corner. Keep moving! Bob and weave!
that's it! Now you're listening to me.
he can take a hit. I'll give you this. Your bot can take a hit.
you better slip that headlock. This ain't gonna end well for you.
I'm trying!
thirty seconds!
thirty... Half a minute.
half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!
you've got 20 seconds!
that's a thousand bucks. Twenty seconds. Let me take over! - No.
move, then. Move!
come on.
get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.
count with me! Count with me! One!
get up! - He can't hear you... You know you're talking to a machine?
four! Five! Six!
get up, Atom!
all the way up! All the way up!
Yes! Yes!
I'm going to fix it!
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.
this thousand bucks... - Yeah, thousand.
double or nothing he can't make another round.
Yeah, thanks anyway. - Deal. Double or nothing.
baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!
are you crazy? You threw away a thousand bucks!
he can barely stand up in there.
look. I really need the money.
I know. Let's work.
Jesus.
watch that. Watch that. - I got that.
I got it. - That's a system failure!
I don't got it. - He's going down.
Yes! - No!
start the count!
start the count!
one! Two! Three!
four! Five! Six! Seven!
eight! Nine!
ten!
you did it! We did it! Wow!
OK. Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.
I know, I know! I know! I know!
kingpin, pay up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know.
we owned! - Let's go. Come on, come on.
yeah? - Hey I got a fight for you.
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand. Seven if he wins.
four grand? You're on. Let's go!
Hey, Bailey, it's me. He won.
can you believe that? The kid's robot actually won.
I know.
happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.
he's been bit. He's been bit real bad.
anyway...
I just wanted you to know.
jab, jab, hook.
jab, jab, hook.
I think you have to move your feet.
your feet. Feet.
nice moves, kid.
how long you been out here?
check it out.
I just spent the night doing something I think is amazing.
incredibly amazing. If it works, you know?
you know his remote was spotty? - Yeah.
I killed it. Got rid of it. We don't need it anymore.
how did you... ?
I had to start over.
but I was able to use the spin frame from Ambush and take the circuitry sleeve out of Noisy Boy, and it works.
he knows nothing, but it works. It really, really works.
what works?
I got to turn it on.
left jab, right uppercut!
Japan!
you put Noisy's voice recognition into Atom?
pretty smart, kid. - Smart?
it could be genius!
it could be the most incredible thing in the history of the entire world!
easy there, chief, easy. Did you drink all these sodas?
I might have had a few. I need you to teach him to box.
are you kidding me? He's nowhere near advanced enough to handle Noisy's voice command.
so he needs your moves. Your commands.
start over from the ground up. - Forget it.
you were a boxer.
yesterday at the Zoo, you could see things happen before they even happened.
I haven't boxed in a long time. I'm not starting now.
who's going to teach him to fight? - You're doing fine.
you don't need me. Sorry.
that was really cool, though, that dance.
you should do that on Saturday night.
don't make fun of me. - I'm serious.
before the fight, when you guys take the ring, you should do it.
there's no way I'm dancing with a robot in front of a boxing crowd.
a boxing crowd? Are you kidding me? This is just a show.
people want to see something they've never seen.
look. You think of all the greats.
think Ali, Sugar Ray, Prince Rakim, Gammer, they all had their nicknames.
they had their personas. They all had flair.
now you? You might not have much robot, but with that dance, you got flair.
Plus, you're a kid. People love that kid thing.
what are you? Like nine? Ten? - I'm 11.
are you sure you're 11?
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.
OK. Anyway, the point is people want to see that.
you're really not messing with me?
I am not messing with you. They're going to love it.
cool. - But...
what? - I won't do it unless you help me.
I can't dance. You're on your own there.
no. Boxing.
Oh, I see. - I program the robot.
you teach him to box. - And you dance.
and you dance.
Yeah. - Yeah?
deal.
deal.
it's going to be cool.
nice.
you're going to be punching guys bigger. You're going to have to punch up.
that's it.
nice.
you, too, old man?
come on. Let's get to work.
nice! Let's do that again.
nice. Three-punch combo.
combo.
again. Again.
faster. Faster. Nice.
you're not even out of breath. I like it.
let's see how you move.
that's good.
step around! Left hook! Left hook!
that's it. Every time.
upper cut!
great fight, fellas.
105. 5, WRUT, the satellite home of robot boxing.
caller two, what do you got for me?
have you heard about this little bot out there, his name is Atom?
Oh, yeah.
my buddies and I saw him the other night, and he dances.
did you say "dances"? - You heard me.
he dances pre-fight with this little kid, and the crowd went nuts for these two.
you put the gimmick aside for a second, and I'm holding here a list of the bots he's beaten.
chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack. No slouches on that list, right?
atom's fought them all, beat them all.
this bot is fast! He escapes shots from these bigger bots, it's insane!
no doubt. I'm telling you, listeners, remember this name:
atom. That's right, A-T-O-M. This bot is one to watch.
awesome fight, sir. - Thanks, thanks.
great fight.
you guys put on a good show. - Thanks.
we'd like to invite you to fight on our card,
virgin America Spectrum Detroit, Friday night.
right. That's a WRB... That's a League fight.
damn right it is. What do you say, fellas? You ready for the show?
heck, yeah.
it's the undercard, but it's still a League fight. So...
I just want you to be relaxed. I want you to be relaxed. Ok, Max?
no freaking out. Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.
you go freaky-deaky, this whole thing can go south.
whatever you do, have fun, have fun. You got to have fun, you understand me?
we've come too far to get out there and freak out and blow this whole thing.
we're going to have fun, and we're going to not freak out!
we're going to stay loose, and we're just going to bam him.
I've spent my whole life waiting to get here. We're going to...
because I tell you what. Trust me when I say no freaking out. You got it?
Yeah, I got it. - Good.
you have been invited to Lemkova Suite. Follow me, please.
what was that? One more time.
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.
sure. Yeah. Let's head up to the champ's suite. Sure.
Wow.
gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova. - Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...
and this, of course, is Tak Mashido.
holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.
I know you have a very important fight tonight, so I'll get right to it.
it's a little far from the action for my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.
very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.
look at that. You want an autograph? Would you mind?
I'd like to buy your robot.
he'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus. And for that I'm willing to pay.
200000
done. - He's not for sale.
of course he is. We can definitely... - He's not for sale.
you are 15 minutes away from getting in the ring with Twin Cities, a vicious League bot.
so, to be clear, my offer stands until the starting bell.
OK. And just to be clear, he's not for sale!
not now, not ever.
give me a minute to clear this up, OK?
Tak, how are you? Max!
be smart. I know you love him, but in 20 minutes there may be nothing left to love.
think about it. Take the offer. - You think about it.
why does she want Atom? Because he's different from other bots!
Yeah, he's different. He's smaller, weaker, - and he's going to get his ass kicked. - He's a boxer.
we taught him to box. You taught him to box!
that's worth something. - I think it is, too.
I think it's worth 200 grand. Two hundred grand.
we can go round and round this all night long.
look at me...
but it's not going to happen.
I got a fight to get to.
ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the march towards the Real Steel Championship makes its way through Detroit's
virgin America Spectrum!
kicking off the evening, in our first undercard, the two-headed tyrant,
twin Cities!
opposing Twin Cities, in his first professional fight, hailing from parts unknown,
Atom!
nice work, boss. - Thanks.
did you switch him to fight mode? - Of course.
all right. This bot is tough to put down. - Atom can do it.
look over there. You see those geeks with the joysticks and consoles?
they're controlling everything their bot does.
they're monitoring his systems, seeing what he sees, stadium feeds of the fights and everything.
this is not like the underground handheld remote bots we've been fighting. This is the League. Stand on that.
so what do we do?
we fight smart, we be patient. And pray.
seriously, pray.
ready!
ready! - Hands up.
fighters ready! Fight!
engage.
slip! Right! Lean back. Right, left! Cover up!
duck! Left roundhouse!
damn it.
lean left! Lean right! Cover up! Cover up!
what's going on in there, Charlie? - He's taking too many hits.
get your hands up!
get out of that corner! Move!
come on, Charlie. He's getting killed in there! Tell him what to do!
that guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
he's got to have a weakness. Find it!
wait, wait, wait.
right shoulder, right shoulder, right shoulder! He's got a tell!
he's got a hitch in his shoulder every time he throws that right bomb! - So?
so we got him! See? Here it comes again!
duck! Spin! Slide left! Roundhouse! One, two!
Backstep. Backstep. Backstep. Lean right.
come on, Charlie! Get in there!
got to get in close where he can't use that size and reach on us!
left to the body! Right to the body! Left to the body!
Yeah, it's working!
stay downstairs! Left, right, left!
these program modes aren't working. - Left! Right hook, slip!
right uppercut! Left uppercut! Duck left. Counter right!
get him, Atom! - Here comes the Charlie Special.
Three-punch combo to the body! Out! In! Counter!
Two-one-two! - Two-one-two.
stay on him! Lunging right!
don't let him go. Right to the body! Straight right to the head!
we got a systems crash!
get him, Atom!
this is not happening, man.
put him away, Charlie! - Spin left!
spin right!
finish him!
do it! - Right uppercut!
he's down!
one! Two! Three!
four! Five! Six!
we got him. Stay down!
he's out! He's out!
Yeah!
corner!
corner! Corner.
victory!
in a time of one minute, 47 seconds of the first round,
atom has defeat...
I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight!
our little bot from the junkyard got a shot at a League fight.
how about that?
and the last thing I want to say to a special girl who won't be named,
Farra Lemkova.
that instead of buying my robot, using your money to control this sport...
that's it! - I'm not done.
why not give the littlest guy the biggest shot?
because I bet if you give him a shot, he'll surprise you!
wouldn't you like to see a little guy get a shot at the Real Steel Championship?
I challenge Zeus to a fight.
any time, any place, anywhere!
you name it! We will be there!
I'm going to get us that fight!
atom, Atom, Atom...
that was a ballsy move, you challenging Zeus like that.
that's one thing to call it.
a lot of people would like to see that.
you're damn right they would. - You listening to this kid? Jeez!
good fight, fellas. - Thanks, man.
look at this. Let's celebrate. - Yeah.
all right, 70-30, right? - Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.
that's so right. - That's very funny.
I told you we shouldn't have sold him. - OK. No, no, no.
I remember now. Who's right? Say who's right. Say "Max is right" .
all right, all right. All right.
we're a good team. - No, no. Max is right.
that was unbelievable. Thank you, Twin Cities.
we set? - Yeah.
let's do it. - Charlie boy.
Ricky, I was just going to call you. - Oh, yeah.
I actually really was going to call you.
don't worry about that.
that was a heck of a fight.
congratulations to both of you. That was good.
it was an amazing fight. That was a great job, young man.
come on, man. - What?
you serious? - You thought I was joking when I said I'd beat you within an inch of your life?
he thought that was a joke. It wasn't a joke.
I got a kid here. And I have your money. We don't have a problem.
I'm sure you do, but I think we know it's about much more than money, don't we?
all right. What do you want? You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?
I got the money in cash here. - Yeah, right.
let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!
run! Come on. Keep up, keep up! - Get him now!
run! Come on!
get off him! Get off him!
come here!
Hey, Ricky.
that's his money! Leave him out of this!
stop!
stop!
take all his money. Take it all.
your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.
he's my father!
well. Looks like a little less than an inch of your life.
well, buddy, that will teach him.
just like old times, Charlie boy!
let's go, boys.
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.
what are we doing here? - Max, just...
is it Farra? She called you, didn't she? We're going to get the Zeus fight.
it's not the Zeus people. I've been thinking about all this, and...
Max!
it's so good to see you.
what is she doing here? - It's better if you go with her now.
we get beat up, so you call her to come and get me?
he's been beat up. I told you he couldn't take care of him!
Yeah. I called her. Look at us. We're a mess.
we're fine. She can leave!
atom's fighting good. We can make the money back.
Charlie, please.
just...
Charlie, we're doing so good.
Charlie, please, no.
don't. Don't. Don't.
please. Please.
trust me, kid. It's better this way, all right?
I know you think you know what's right, but you don't.
you're too young. You don't know.
look at me, trust me.
and legally she has custody, so what can I do?
what can I do?
I don't want your money, Marvin.
Max, we have our own swimming pool and we have a hot tub and a lot of super fun toys to play with.
do you want to play with them? It's going to be fun.
what's going on?
he won't even talk to me, so thanks for that, Charlie.
I'm going to wait in the car.
you don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.
what do you want me to say? I'm sorry?
you knew from day one what this was.
you decided to take the ride.
you thought me, you, and a little robot from the junk heap were going to ride off into the sunset?
no, you forgot who I was!
you deserve better...
...than me.
will you say something, please?
I tried. What do you want from me?
I want you to fight for me.
that's all I ever wanted.
don't ask.
so no Max.
it's better this way. Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.
did you not see the way he looked at you?
that's the way I looked at my dad.
even now I would give anything to have that back.
your dad was special. He was in your corner from day one.
me, come on. I blew it.
I blew it.
when Max was born I just...
freaked out.
but something would have been better than nothing.
I wouldn't know where to start.
Yeah, you do. - I don't.
you do. - No.
you do.
I got to go.
twelve hundred miles for a kiss.
worth it. Worth it.
go get him, Charlie.
you sound like your dad.
look, I know you think I abandoned you, and I guess I did originally.
then you sold me.
Charlie.
you have no business being here.
that's true. You've got full custody. He's yours.
and I know I've done all kinds of wrong by this kid, but if you'll let me...
I'd just like to do one thing right.
right.
where were we? - You sold me.
right, yeah, that happened.
wait, what? - Then we had our asses kicked.
and you slept on a shelf in a truck, and it was awful.
and dangerous. - Really dangerous.
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.
that's why you came? To say you're sorry?
no. I mean, yes. Yes.
but no. No, I came to tell you that I heard you.
I got it. I'm a little slow, but I got it.
I know you had a bum ride, and I wasn't there and I should have been.
I should have been.
your mom was...
she was cool, wasn't she?
she was.
she was the coolest.
Yeah, she was.
and I'm sorry about... what happened with her.
and I can't get those years back, Max, but I'm here right now...
and if you're up for it, I'm ready to fight.
we got the Zeus fight.
what?
no, no, we didn't.
you got the Zeus fight.
so what do you say, Debra?
can we do this one last thing?
one night. - It's all we need. Thank you.
we'll probably get our asses kicked, but at least we'll go down swinging.
yeah? What do you say?
welcome to New York's Bing Arena and the Real Steel Championship Bout.
Tim, it's the fight we never thought we'd see.
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion, against the underdog, rising star Atom.
the champ's handlers have agreed to fight outside the circle of well-known League bots, and have decided to give the people a true David versus Goliath spectacle.
now, Tim, help me out on this. Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?
the greatest robot boxer of all time gives a shot at the belt to a G-2 named Atom?
well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido, Team Zeus has lost their minds.
now, he may look cool as he enters the arena, but he has made no bones about his disdain for this matchup.
our cameras tried to catch up with him earlier this week.
look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't even stop to talk to the press, referring only to this fight as an insult to his creation.
now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer, did more than just challenge Zeus.
he did so publicly.
the challenge went viral and created a PR nightmare for the champ.
no argument there. And I think the Zeus camp knows exactly what they're doing.
that they do. Come on.
giving a shot at the belt to a nobody from nowhere.
this "junkyard dog," if you will. That's a marketing stunt.
and judging from this crowd, that stunt is working.
we can't win, can we?
we'll see.
as the challenger makes his way into the arena, you can hear the surge of excitement.
atom has arrived onto the WRB scene with a vengeance, using a style, some would call it human-like, that bot fighting has rarely seen.
atom and his pint-size trainer step into the ring and the look on Farra Lemkova's face says it all.
welcome to the bigs, junior!
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom don't make it out the first round.
who wants some?
I'll take some of that action.
Hey, there! I'll take some of that action.
how's it going... partner?
partner?
that's great. How about a hundred K? Is that funny?
hundred K says Atom doesn't see round two.
you carrying around that kind of scratch?
Yeah. - Hundred K?
tell you what. Remember section 101, row C, and you can bring me my money right to my seat.
101, row C? Hundred K?
you heard me, homey.
homey? - Right?
homeboy!
all right. Peace out, posse.
come on, sugar. Let's go.
never beaten. - It's showtime!
never threatened.
the king of the ring, the ruler of robots!
bow down to the mighty Zeus!
Oh, shit!
that was awesome.
come on, let's go.
ladies and gentlemen, in a bout scheduled for five rounds for the World Robot Boxing Championship, in the corner to my right, the challenger, Atom!
Showboat!
and in the corner to my left, the undeniable champion of this universe and any other universe known or unknown, the mighty Zeus!
and now, ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for Real Steel!
this is what it's all about!
there's the starting bell and we are underway.
the bots emerge from their corners.
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.
on your feet!
looks like we are in for another Zeus clinic.
referee Matt Geiger coming in the ring to start the count.
get up!
push up! Stand up!
but look at this. The little bot's back on his feet to get a second blistering attack from Zeus!
atom is down for the second time in less than ten seconds.
he's too strong! - That's my boy right there!
get up and get in the game!
come on! No, please Atom, get up! Please!
get up! Get up! Get up!
once again, the challenger finds his feet!
lean back!
atom's getting pummeled into the corner!
get out of there! - Move!
a demolishing inside shot.
get your hands up!
hands up!
crush that little can!
get out of the corner!
Kenton desperately trying to command his robot out of that suicide corner.
get your feet under you!
good night, sparring bot!
it might have taken Zeus a bit longer, but he's done it again!
atom is down for the third and possibly final time tonight.
stand up! - Two!
three!
atom, get up!
get up, Atom. - Get up, Atom.
six! Seven! - Get up!
eight! Nine!
I don't believe this! Against all odds, this little bot is on his feet again.
come on, Atom!
he can't survive this!
come on, Charlie! - Right uppercut!
atom has landed a punch!
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from an uppercut that he never saw coming!
advance!
fade back, counter right!
fade back, counter right!
right cross! Right cross! Right cross! Left hook!
let's go! Come on! - Take him down!
for the first time in his dominant run,
Zeus has met a bot who simply won't back down!
the crowd is going nuts! Zeus gives it everything he's got as we reach the last 15 seconds of round one!
Zeus corners Atom, going double duty with both fists!
downtown, uptown, as the clock winds down!
hands up, chin down. - Stay low, stay low!
only five seconds left, as here comes that monster piston-packed right of the champ!
there's the bell! I don't believe it. Somehow Atom has survived.
we will have a second round. And the crowd here is thrilled!
he made it! Yeah! Corner!
we got to get out of here. We got to get out of here now!
we got to go this way. Come on!
OK, you sit down.
let's go, homey. - All right.
I'll be back for you, baby.
get your hands off me!
both corners furiously working on their bots.
this crowd came here tonight expecting a massacre, but instead they're getting a war!
you got it? - Yeah.
all right. Here we go.
what is happening?
he is fully prepared for all possible contingencies. He will be fine.
what next?
round two.
round two kicks off, and incredibly the challenger, Atom, is giving the champ a run for his money.
Zeus tosses the smaller bot across the ring like a tin can!
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta of straight rights to the champ's dome!
toe-to-toe they stand, trading deafening blows!
whatever strategy either corner had cooked up has been destroyed!
metal bashing metal. Steel smashing steel.
this is a brawl!
the crowd is on their feet, watching two machines driven to kill each other!
something has to give, and it does!
atom goes down again!
lights out for the junkyard dog who put on a heck of a show here tonight!
and yet again, Atom rises up.
Kenton must have hardwired this bot with the will to go on!
midway through round four, and Zeus is looking to end this thing right now.
the champ is holding nothing back as he cracks open the hurt locker!
atom is stumbling around the ring, apparently disoriented and dazed!
hands up! - What's going on?
I think the voice recog is shot! He's not responding!
Zeus has found yet another gear of violence, drilling Atom's midsection.
No! Stop! Do something!
he can't hear me!
but the bell sounds, and once again this little robot has stunned the world!
we're done, Max! He can't hear me. This is murder. We've had enough.
I'm disabling the voice recognition. - He can't hear me!
Yes, but he can see you! - What?
I'm putting him in shadow mode. Show him what to do.
without the voice recognition, he'll move even faster!
no way. No way!
look at them. They are freaking out!
rich girl is ripping him a new one over there!
do you know why? Because they're scared.
because Atom can do things no other bot has ever done.
but I can't do it! - Yes, you can.
I can't. - Yes, you can.
show him what to do. You have to fight the last round.
don't ask me. Don't.
Charlie... please. I beg you.
are you kidding me with those eyes?
damn it!
Yes!
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I know you're in there! I'm not sure if you're getting this or what, but I know you're in there!
Kenton. In or out? - In. Give me a minute.
I know you can't hear me, but you can see me, so watch me!
watch... me.
you know you're talking to a robot. - I know. Shut up.
watch me.
an epic battle being waged here tonight, as the fifth and final round gets underway.
come on, Atom!
wait a second. Are you seeing this?
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing just outside the ring!
it looks like Atom has a shadow function.
so, basically, that means Charlie Kenton is fighting the last round of this fight against Zeus.
it doesn't seem to help, because Atom is backed up against the ropes again.
help him! Fight back!
not yet.
Tak Mashido supervising personally as Zeus hammers down, furiously trying to end this thing once and for all.
I got to tell you, folks, the champ looks tired.
this robot seems to be running on empty.
I don't believe it. Atom is taunting Zeus.
switch to turbo! - He's actually asking for more.
please do something!
not yet. - That's right, Charlie. Not yet.
nitrous pistons, now!
he's not going to last much longer!
fight back! - Not yet.
hang in there!
atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!
wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!
Zeus is slowing down!
the champ's power core is clearly depleted.
Charlie, please!
Hey, kid.
now. - Now!
get in there!
knock that little bitch! Bust him open!
Yeah! That's right!
do something!
move!
override. Switching to manual.
in a shocking move, Tak Mashido is manually operating his robot personally!
work the body! Get inside him! - Get him, Atom!
look at this! The champ is trying desperately to stay on his feet, but Kenton is relentless, landing blow after blow after blow to the body!
left! Right! Left! Right!
a huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!
this little bot has dug deep here tonight and shown something damn near heart!
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
he's good!
Zeus gets to his feet, but Kenton has Atom on him again, landing punch after punch!
Tak Mashido and his super bot have no answer.
Zeus pins Atom's left arm, but Kenton is undaunted!
it all comes down to this, folks!
drop him, Charlie! Now!
Kenton is about to drop the champ... - No! There's the bell!
Zeus is saved by the bell!
amazingly, we will go to the judges' cards!
ladies and gentlemen, after five rounds, we go to the judges' scorecards.
judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.
judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.
and Judge Number Three scores the fight 47-46, for the winner and still World Robot Boxing champion,
Zeus!
Farra Lemkova, you got way more than you bargained for tonight.
some would say that your bot won the decision but lost the fight.
she looks pissed.
it took a little longer than we thought, but the result is as expected.
we won. Zeus is still undefeated.
any comment on the absolutely humiliating near loss your bot suffered tonight?
nothing. - No comment.
Max. Where's Max?
there he is. Max.
they're already calling your bot "the people's champion" .
what do you say to that?
people's champion?
sounds pretty good to me.
dad? Dad!
dad!
I really want you to know...
no, I need you to know.
don't worry.
your secret's safe with me.
wait here. Wait here.
Yes!
where are you, Charlie? More importantly, where is my money?
you're into me for 30 grand. - Jack, I'm going to pay you.
this ain't Jack! It's Bill Panner.
you owe Jack money, too? Charlie, you pay me first!
bill. We're good, buddy. I got your money. It's right here in my hand.
why don't we meet up on the... ?
your phone's going all screwy. Hello? - I'm losing you.
I can't hear what you're say...
Hey, mister. Is that Ambush?
Yeah. - Can we see him?
you want to see him? - Yeah.
give me a minute.
this...
this is Ambush. Wakey, wakey.
what robot is he fighting? - Actually he's going to fight...
whoa, little lady. What are you doing?
can we get a picture with him?
sure. For five dollars.
you want five dollars? Seriously?
no, I want five dollars immediately.
come on, guys.
all right, I'm kidding. Three bucks. - Whatever.
how about $2. 50? - You suck!
it's going to be one of those towns, huh?
welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.
please take your seats. We're almost ready to get this thing started.
I was told my bot was fighting an 800-pound steer.
that is not 800 pounds, knucklehead.
Charlie "the Can Do Kid" Kenton. Time has not been good to you, my friend.
Ricky, we got a big problem here. - Slow down there, hoss.
last time I saw you, you were staring at the ceiling at the Sam Houston Center with the taste of my right cross all over your face.
are we good to go here? - Yeah.
we agreed that my boxer would fight an 800-pound steer for three grand.
am I right? - Yes, sir. We did.
that bull is like 2, 000 pounds.
I'll tell you something.
your bot don't fight, you don't get paid! How about that?
get the hell out of here.
why don't we make this more interesting. My bot against your bull, straight up.
how much? - Twenty grand, winner takes all.
twenty grand. You got 20 grand? - In a safe in my truck.
all right, Charlie.
twenty grand it is, but if you lose and you welch,
I'll come after you and beat you to within an inch of your life.
you know that I can do that because I already done it!
what's your problem? In life you get too close, in the ring you stand back like a girl. Just shake.
all right. Shake and pow! Just like that once again. You want to dance again?
cheer for this guy. Give him some luck. He needs some luck, y'all.
don't touch that bull.
ladies and gentlemen, I got to ask, do we have any fans of robot boxing here today?
now, listen, friends, I understand we can't all afford to go all the way over there to Dallas and pay $300 for one of those World Robot Boxing League fights.
so, I decided that I would bring a robot boxing match right here to our little fair here in San Leandro.
how about that?
ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you,
ambush!
let's do it!
all right, big fella.
he's a big fella, ain't he?
take a turn. Let them see how beautiful you are.
show them some power.
look at that. He's getting all kungfu on us.
Yeah, big fella.
Ambush's opponent today, he's last year's runner-up in the baddest of the bulls competition, ladies and gentlemen,
black Thunder!
let's get it on! - Let's get this thing started.
is that all you got?
Yeah, brother. Bring it on.
take him, take him.
ambush lays the smackdown on that prime beef.
I got more for you, big fella. We're just getting started.
OK. Jump, now!
ambush, decks Black Thunder, but when you mess with the bull, you're going to get the horns.
you like that. I can tell. You like that.
Jesus. Turn around!
Ricky! Ricky, stop this thing!
come on. We're still in this thing. Just hop. Hop.
that's it. Come on.
Ricky, enough! Enough!
I can't hear you over the sound of your robot being destroyed.
kill!
come on, get up.
get up! Come on!
No!
come on, no. No, no, no!
ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for our warriors out here today at the 2020 San Leandro County Fair.
thank you for coming out, and we'll see you next time, because there will be one.
give me that leg.
sure. For five dollars.
boo-yah!
all right! That was ridonculous fun, now wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?
I'm going to come by for my money, Charlie boy. You best have it.
everybody say "hey!" - Hey!
everybody say "ho!" - Ho!
how about that? How you doing there, little robot?
my keys, damn it.
one more step and I'll drop you like your girlfriend.
Charlie, relax.
I'm not paying you. That was a bogus fight. It cost me my last robot.
just listen to us. - Do you recall Caroline Fallon?
she's my ex-girlfriend. I haven't seen her in ten years. What does she want?
nothing. She died.
do you recall Max Kenton?
he's my son. He's got to be nine.
eleven. - Eleven. OK.
is he dead, too?
no, he's fine. That's why we're here.
this court is convened to address the custodial status of one Max Kenton, age 11.
mother, Caroline Fallon, deceased. Father, Charles Kenton.
Debra Fallon Barnes, you're the boy's aunt.
Yes. As I've already told you, my husband, Marvin, is wealthy, and we can more than provide for Max.
I appreciate that, but per Texas state law, without a written will next of kin retains custody.
Charles Kenton, who is aware of this custody hearing, and we are expecting him...
I need a new robot now.
I had a big fight for Ambush next Saturday.
I got to show up with something.
noisy Boy is for sale? In his day, Noisy Boy was a killer.
how much? That's a good deal. What's wrong with him?
I can live with that.
I don't have it.
Charles Kenton waived all of his rights to custody right after the boy was born.
I can more than provide for Max.
please be Charles Kenton.
Charlie, yeah.
I'm here to sign some paper that releases my rights to the custody of my son.
that's why I'm here. Do I need to be here?
Charlie.
do you even remember me?
Debra, Caroline's sister. - Yeah, Debra. How are you?
Mr. Kenton. Please take a seat.
your Honor, may I please go and see my nephew now?
Yes, you may.
how about you, Mr. Kenton? - What?
you can spend some time with him, if you'd like.
with the kid? - Yeah, the kid.
Max. Your son? - All right.
you've been working with those robots for so long, you've become one.
honey, you wait right here. I'm going to be back.
you take all the time you need, sweetheart.
your Honor, I'd like to, at this juncture, step out and call my attorney, if that's all right.
please.
come on. Come on. There you are.
he'll be in a foster home.
no, they find good families. Young. Energetic. Yeah.
Thanks, Michael. I will. OK.
Marvin Barnes. I'm Debra's husband. - Right, yeah.
Debra really wants to adopt Max.
I'm up for it. But... - Seventy-five grand.
$75, 000? You're serious?
the thing is...
we're supposed to go to Italy this summer with my oldest friend and his wife.
two months in Tuscany and all over.
just the four of you. Sounds nice.
we'll be back in New York by the end of August.
in August. A hundred.
$100, 000? - You heard me.
you're crazy. - Not nearly as crazy as your wife if you tell her I just signed over that kid to the state of Texas.
there's a real way everyone gets what they want here.
so here's what you're going to do.
you're going to tell your wife I'll only sign over custody to her if I get to spend the summer with the kid first.
just tell her how guilty she made me feel for being such a terrible absentee dad, how I want to make good with junior, a little fatherly bonding, whatnot.
she'll buy it, you get to be the hero and everybody wins.
OK. But not a word about the money to Debra, you understand?
I understand.
I'll give you 50 grand tonight when we drop off Max and the other 50 when we get back in August and you deliver him to us in New York.
pleasure doing business with you.
your Honor, I'm happy we all took the time to make the best decision for everyone.
happy? - Yeah, it's me.
I'm buying Noisy Boy. I got the money.
take him to Tallet's Gym and I'll meet you there.
Hello?
Bailey?
some guy is here with the robot you're buying,
I gotta tell you Charlie, it smells like disaster to me.
nice to see you, too.
might I also say how cute you look. - Give it up.
God, I need a shower. You want to take a shower? Come on.
let me make something clear.
a creepy dude with a robot in a box has been sitting outside my gym for two hours.
putting aside the fact that you're doing what I'm guessing is a black market deal on my doorstep, how will you pay him when Ambush just got destroyed?
the money is on its way. Just distract him.
I have been. It's exhausting.
you're the best. - Yeah? Really?
is that why you're buying a $45, 000 robot when you owe me six grand in rent?
because I'm the best? - Three.
six. Listen, there is a guy with real money who wants to buy this place.
come on. Like you're really going to sell your dad's gym.
if you don't make rent, I can't make payments and I won't have a choice.
your father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass - if you sold this place. - My father would climb out of his grave and kick your ass.
Bailey?
don't. - Don't what?
don't do that.
don't what? - Don't do that thing.
no, you like that thing. - No.
Yeah. - No, I don't like that thing.
I used to. Once. Briefly. Now I like money more.
I don't believe you. - I don't care.
Marvin.
your money has arrived.
Marv.
fifty grand, as promised.
here are all our numbers and contact info over in Europe.
so that's everything there.
so Marvin tells me you want this time with Max.
Yeah. - You did the right thing, giving me custody.
Caroline would have wanted that.
now, have him back in New York on August 27th.
that's a deal.
OK, let's go get Max. OK? Let's get Max.
it's OK. You want to go around the other side here and I'll get Max?
Hey. Max. See you, pal.
Max, we'll see you at the end of the summer, honey.
I'm Charlie.
it's been a long time. You know, I'm your...
you screwed me. - Nice mouth.
do you know where they're going?
Italy? - Yeah, Italy.
so how did I get stuck here with you?
relax, kid. You got a whole life of fine living ahead of you.
Charlie!
dude's pissed. He's going to take off.
did Marvin give you that money? - Here, just close the deal.
I'll be right there, OK?
I'm Bailey. - Max.
Max Kenton.
so this is your... - Yeah, it's him.
don't worry about it, OK?
I'm looking at you two and...
just go and put Noisy in the shop, please? Thank you.
you're going to stay here with her while I'm on the road.
how much did he give you? - You're coming at this the wrong way.
no, tell me. I want to know.
fifty thousand, OK?
he gave me $50, 000 to sign you over to her.
will you shut up now?
you sold me?
sounds worse than it is.
really. - It's to take care of you.
give me half the money and you won't have to.
where are you going to go? - Give me the money. I'll be fine.
I told your aunt I'll get you to New York at the end of the summer.
now you're concerned for aunt Debra?
you sold me for 50 grand. You owe me half!
I don't have it! I spent the money on a robot. It's gone! OK? Gone!
I'm through here.
what do we got?
noisy Boy has arrived.
that's a lot of airline stickers and customs tags.
he's been all over the world. - London, Japan, Brazil, San Paulo...
hasn't seen North American soil in over two years.
maybe that's why you got such a good price, genius.
decided to stay?
this is Bailey. She'll be looking after you for a few weeks.
by the way, I need you to look after the kid for a few weeks.
I want half that money. - Are we back to this again?
is there a real robot boxer in there?
noisy Boy's in there. You ever heard of him?
of course. He fought Rubicon for the WRB belt in 2016.
holy crap, he looks amazing.
his composite armor has been replaced. Let's see if the insides look as good.
I've watched that fight with Rubicon like 20 times.
he should have had him in the third round, but Rubicon got lucky with a huge right and ended it.
relax, kid, he's on our side.
not funny. - Kind of funny.
you know he has voice recognition, right?
no, he doesn't. - He didn't in the League.
when Noisy fought in Brazil, they must have put it in.
brazilians are crazy about that talk-to-your-robot crap.
right, left, uppercut!
doesn't work. Right, left, uppercut!
I knew that price was too good to be true. We got screwed.
give me a second. Let me see if I can fix it. - Look how good he looks, too.
give me two seconds. Let me look at something!
why didn't you ask to look at it? - Relax!
was that Japanese?
let me see if I can reset him to English.
how do you know Japanese?
video games.
you play video games in Japanese?
japanese bootlegs are always better.
give me that.
he's reset to English, and I found his command matrix.
they have pre-loaded a bunch of combinations.
they should be listed here.
top salvo!
what did I tell you?
gravity One Downtown!
I was due for some good luck!
you're welcome. - Thank you.
Bailey, help me put him in the truck. I am going to go and get your money.
give me the keys. - I'm coming with you.
no, you're not. - Why not?
because I don't want you with me, OK?
I'm either coming with you, or you're fishing for your keys in the sewer.
your choice. What's it going to be, old man?
Oh, my God. That was close, wasn't it?
don't do that again. - That's scaring you, isn't it?
don't do this again?
get in. Just get in. Give me the keys first.
wait till I get in the truck. Thanks, Big Pops.
sweet ride.
put on your seatbelt and don't talk.
I'm taking all bets!
keep up. Stay close.
Charlie Kenton is in the house!
all right, all right. - Come on, man!
is that Noisy Boy? - The one and only.
that's Noisy Boy!
Noisy's been in Japan. Softer bots over there.
sure you want to fight him tonight? - What do you got?
he can take any bot in this place. You know it.
you can have any undercard you want.
five thousand guaranteed.
a thousand every round your bot survives.
fight till the death!
no. Give me the main event.
come on. - This is Noisy Boy.
an original Tak Mashido bot.
he was a World Robot League boxer. Come on!
you want to fight Midas?
fifty thousand guaranteed, winner takes all.
fifty? Really, 50? Now you're talking.
listen, listen. No, look.
listen! - Give me a sec.
we should take an undercard fight, make a little cash and get out of here!
first, there is no "we."
second, he's going to crush Midas, and I'm going to make real cash!
we'll take Midas!
tonight, our main event features the gold-blooded killer!
this pimped-out punk is programmed for pain!
I give to you the mighty Midas!
against a bot who ran with the big boys in the WRB!
he's been on an exile tour overseas, but now he's back home, and he's ready to make some noise!
take your first look in a long time at Noisy Boy!
crash Palace, who's ready for some destruction?!
let's make some money! Come on!
we have Midas against Noisy Boy.
noisy Boy against Midas.
you've been waiting all night for this matchup, Crash Palace!
scimitar right!
did you see that?
easy money, easy money all night. All night long!
come on! It's not over yet. Let's go!
skull salvo! Firefight!
Yeah! Go, Noisy! - Undercard, huh?
Shockfist!
get in there. Shogun Trinity!
let's finish him. Gravity Slam, Uptown!
this son-of-a-bitch is crazy!
full Metal Feud! Bring it!
Southpaw! Pain Revolution!
I got something for you.
don't you run from me! You can't run from me!
get up!
that's illegal!
this is the underworld. There are no rules!
now we're seeing the Midas touch.
no. Hands up!
get back in that corner, bitch, and take this whooping like a man!
he's getting killed in there!
it's a headset! You talk into it and you tell him what to do!
panic Shield!
that's it. One -Two Overlord!
no, no. Shatter Punch!
five Recall! - Get some!
jab, jab!
right roundhouse!
did he just spit his juice in Midas's face?
no, you did not spit in Midas's face!
it's party time now, Crash Palace!
use your left!
Noisy's trying to do something with his one arm!
but Midas pins him, and Daddy goes to work!
no, no! Get up!
get some!
move! Get out of the corner!
Midas! Midas! Midas!
somebody's ready to serve up a decappuccino!
I got something for you! You ready?
good night! That's a home run for Midas.
and so long to Noisy Boy.
that sucked. You hungry?
I saved what's left of Noisy's voice recognition board.
other than that, he's trash. I got to get a new robot together.
I need to find a mainframe. What?
I hate hamburgers. - What kid hates burgers?
fine. More for me. Here, drink this.
you never should have taken that fight.
Really? Really? Thanks, genius.
do you even think about the stuff you do before you do it?
you had no idea how to fight that fight.
those combination codes, you didn't know what half of them even meant.
you threw them in there cocky and half-assed.
you never gave him a chance. - He wasn't that good.
noisy Boy was a great robot.
was. Was a great robot back in the League, back in the day.
but look around you. This place is where once great robots go to die.
so throw him away.
that's what you do, right? Anything you don't need you throw away.
Wow.
it's been a long night.
if you want to sleep indoors tonight, shut up and get in the truck.
don't look at me like that way. Get in the truck!
they gave me 400 for his head.
you stay put. I'm going to look for parts.
I'm coming with you. That drink has my heart pounding.
if I sit in this truck by myself, my head will explode.
whatever. Just keep up.
crap.
stay back.
all right, keep up.
these searchlights are automated, but you got to time them right, so stay close.
it's all right.
come on, come on.
we're going to get caught. - Come on.
easy, easy. Easy, easy.
quick, quick. Down in here! Go, go, go!
robots are on the east side. We got to be quick in here.
once we're through here, there's no more searchlights. Quick! Go!
here it is. - What are we looking for?
anything I could use to put a fighting bot together.
Hey, look. - What?
it's so small.
Yeah. That's before your time.
that's a Generation One, the very first fighting bot.
they wanted them to look like us. The more human, the better.
crazy how quick everything changed. Put that in the cart.
what changed? - A good question. Human boxing.
it just faded. - Why?
because the money moved on. People wanted more carnage, more show.
you had the whole Brazilian underground, the Gracies, the Machados, jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and a thousand styles in between.
full-on ground-and-pound.
look at this. - What's that?
I don't know.
not bad. Good spot.
you still had human fighters, human bodies, so you couldn't give the people what they really wanted:
true, no-holds-barred violence.
the next logical step, get the humans out of there and let the machines kill each other.
do you miss it?
boxing. Do you miss it? - Careful.
what? I want to know.
careful, you're on a cliff.
that's a long way down. If you fell, you'd definitely...
Charlie, help me!
Charlie!
Charlie! - Max! Max!
Max!
try not to move! - I'm on some sort of robot arm.
wait! Just easy, easy. Give me your hand. Nice and easy.
very slowly. Good. Don't look down. Look at me. Look at me.
that's it! I've got you! You don't have to be scared. I got you!
it's so far! - It's OK. I got you.
give me your other hand. Nice and slow.
just give me your other hand very slowly. Reach back. Come on. Reach!
look at me. We're going to do this together.
you and me. Just look at me. That's it.
one... two... three!
that's it. I got you! I got you. I got you. I got you.
you're safe. You're safe.
all right, I got you.
you all right? - Yeah.
come here. Easy. Easy.
you all right?
you all right? - Yeah.
I told you it was dangerous.
careful. We're still on the edge here.
Charlie, I think there's a whole robot in there.
so what? Let's go. Come on.
I'm taking him with me. He saved my life.
he did not save your life. I saved your life. Let's go.
just bring the cart to the edge. I'll use the winch to get him out.
you want that piece of junk? You get the cart yourself. I'm through here.
this is what's left of Noisy Boy?
that's it.
his head does make a nice addition to the front of the Crash Palace.
it's not funny. - Let's get a robot, you and me.
good idea. You're broke. I'm almost there myself.
you destroyed the best shot you had. - We'll put one together.
you're brilliant at this. There's good stuff here.
there's nothing here. - There is. Look.
all your junk is... it's junk.
you're not even in the game anymore.
it's all garbage. - I heard you. It's garbage.
don't get loud with me.
you're your problem. - What's that supposed to mean?
I have been here for you a long time.
in the ring, out of the ring, and the whole ugly spiral down, and I'm tired.
my father invested everything he had in your fight career. We loved...
he loved you like family. And this is his home.
I'm just trying not to let it die. That's my plan.
what's yours?
you're done, right?
you're finally done? Because I sure as hell am, Charlie.
I got nothing left.
all right.
maybe there's something here.
this robot the kid brought in last night. Would you look at it for me?
please?
I've never seen anything like it before. He's Generation Two, but barely.
I found a power cell that fits him, and I hooked him up to this old G-2 remote.
you can move him around, but he's crap.
maybe I can get a sparring gig for him, make a few hundred bucks.
stop.
it's my robot!
it took me half the night dragging him out of there. He's mine.
he's yours? Yeah. But the parts we're putting in him are mine!
you idiots should see if he powers up before you fight over him.
what happened to you?
watch out. Stay back.
looks like he's got a shadow function. That's pretty rare.
he can mime your movements and store them in memory.
is there anything here we could use? - Not much.
there's a bucket...
there's a bucket I use to wash the truck.
use it and clean him up. He smells like crap.
wash yourself off, too, while you're at it. You stink.
I switched him to remote. It's pretty basic.
just use the toggles here to steer him and walk him.
you play video games, right? - Of course.
same idea, only this one's a thousand-pound robot.
cool.
atom.
his name is Atom. Can we get him a fight?
I don't think he was ever a boxing robot.
he's a G-2, built in early 2014. He was a sparring bot.
they must have built robots like this one that could mirror the fighting style of any other robot.
OK, so can we get him a fight?
are you not listening? He's a sparring bot.
built to take a lot of hits, but never dishing out any real punishment.
you could always sell him off for parts.
can't you get him a fight? - "Why can't you get him a fight?"
God, you don't quit, do you?
you want me to put him in some bottom-rung scrap-fest to the death?
I saw how scared you were at Crash Palace.
the places that would let you fight this robot would make you pee your pants.
excellent. Get him a fight.
stubborn kid.
surprise, surprise.
let's take a walk.
can you understand me?
don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
you've known Charlie a long time.
too long. We both kind of grew up in this gym.
my dad, he trained him.
that's them. That's Charlie.
what was he like? - As a boxer?
as anything. - He was something.
he was lean, tough.
no quit, no fear.
come here. I want to show you something.
I have this newspaper article from Phoenix 2007
when Charlie fought Nico Tandy, the top contender.
you were at the Nico Tandy fight?
I was. Charlie was supposed to be a warm-up fight, an easy win.
Nico wasn't even supposed to break a sweat, but...
nobody told Charlie that, so he just kept coming and coming at him.
check this out.
that's Charlie.
first, Nico couldn't believe the balls on this nobody.
but Charlie kept coming, and that's when Nico looked scared.
Really? - Really.
he was toying with Nico.
the top contender, number two in the world, and Charlie was dancing with him.
Charlie was floating inches off the canvas that night.
he was like a ghost. Nico couldn't even see him.
I could.
he was beautiful.
he was beautiful.
so what happened? Did Charlie beat Nico Tandy?
no, Nico Tandy put me on my ass in the 12th round. Twice.
second time for good. Lights out.
you were ahead on the scorecards - going into the 12th round. - Nico Tandy rung my bell and went on to be the undefeated world champ for the next three years.
he knocked you out? - Yeah. So did a lot of guys.
you knocked a lot of guys out, too.
24 and 19. It's not exactly a career. - But every fight a knockout.
Yeah. - Win or lose, fight's not over - till someone's on the mat. - Till someone's on the mat.
your old man taught me that. - Damn straight he taught you that.
who else did you fight? - Go get your stuff together.
I don't need to. Did you fight for the title?
Yeah, you do. We leave in an hour. Go.
Wow. Here.
keep it.
Thanks. - You're welcome.
I like that kid.
he likes you.
what I said yesterday was... - No, nothing more to say.
I'm heading off to Atlanta tonight to see if I can get a partner or raise money to get a new bot.
that's what you wanted, right? Me gone?
Yeah, that's what I wanted.
OK.
look.
the champ is here. Zeus is here.
Yeah.
Zeus! No one has ever gone two rounds with this monster. Two rounds!
the champ puts his Real Steel world championship belt on the line tonight.
he just may have a real fight on his hands.
Zeus, greatest robot boxer of all time. Ever. End of story. Good night!
so cool. It's so cool. - What?
come on.
listen up. I got to go find Finn.
I want you to stay in this area, OK? - OK.
out of the way. Champ coming through. Zeus coming through.
move, move. Champ coming through.
Farra Lemkova, daughter behind the father/daughter Zeus team.
they say your father's the money and you are the mind behind Zeus.
you're very kind, but I assure you, the mind behind Zeus belongs to the great Tak Mashido.
what did it take to lure the reclusive genius, former boy wonder and arguably the most important bot designer in the history of the sport out of retirement?
why don't you ask him yourself?
is this Tak Mashido's greatest creation?
Zeus is autonomous and constantly evolving during a fight.
with his adaptive operating system, he recognizes patterns and rewrites his fight code instantaneously.
for myself and Joe Sixpack out there, are you saying that Zeus...
I'm saying that no matter what happens in that ring...
the result of any fight is inevitable.
what Zeus sees...
he kills.
sweet.
I'm never going into business with you.
I just need a break here, Finn, come on.
you got that old bot truck out there. You always got something in there.
I got an old G-2 sparring bot, ain't worth the paint left on it.
what am I supposed to do with that?
the Zoo. Take him to the Zoo. They fight there tomorrow.
even I wouldn't be caught dead at the Zoo.
Finn, I just need a little loan.
what?
you're serious, Charlie? - A loan.
couple hundred. Few hundred. Whatever you got.
you know I'm good for it.
I know you, man, and as much as I like you, dude...
you're a bad bet, brother.
right, yeah.
did you see that? That's what's left of Axelrod.
where you been? I told you to stay put.
you should have seen him. Zeus was, like, amazing!
amazing, huh? - Unbelievable, yeah.
he was just peppering Axelrod with punches, but so fast. It was incredible.
axelrod didn't even land a punch. He didn't even survive the first round.
is that what you think boxing is?
Zeus beating up some piece of steel that they feed him?
axelrod's not just some piece of steel.
and that is what boxing is now. Deal with it.
and I love it, and I'm in it now.
you're in it now, are you? You and your G-2 sparring bot?
he's more than that. If you'd get us a fight, you'd see.
you're in luck, kid. There's a lovely place called the Zoo.
tomorrow afternoon, you'll get your fight.
great. - And it will be the end.
I told you I hate hamburgers!
it's a burrito!
right uppercut.
left uppercut.
bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.
again. Bend your knees. Rise up with both hands.
you been up all night?
Yeah. I cleaned him up.
I'm using shadow mode to program some fight moves and sync them to the remote.
Yeah. I saw that double-up punch you were showing him.
that's lethal stuff.
let's do this.
let's do breakfast first.
you know you're bringing him home in pieces, right?
we'll see.
let me deal with this. - Charlie Kenton. This is Max.
kingpin. Call me Kingpin.
all right, Kingpin, so... - How much a round?
what's this, we on a field trip?
all right. He can fight my robot Metro.
I'll give you a hundred bucks for one two-minute round.
take it. - Three hundred.
one hundred. Baby boy, I'm going to give you $100 just to get in with Metro.
how about 500 for two rounds?
two rounds. Son, he ain't going to survive one round.
what if he does? - He ain't.
let's just say he does.
if he's still standing after one round...
I'll give you a thousand bucks.
shut it!
but if he dies in there, which he will, junior...
I get to keep what's left.
take the hundred.
deal.
we're on. We on!
let's go!
you should have taken the hundred. - I got us a thousand.
Yeah, if he wins.
you want me to drive?
he's my bot. I got this!
this ain't a video game. This is for real. Right here.
you said he's coming home in pieces. What difference does it make?
all right.
I got this.
let's get it on! Let's get it on!
let's get it on like Ping-Pong in Hong Kong!
give me a bell! Give me a bell!
don't watch Atom. Watch your opponent. Watch him.
watch out for that foot. He's looking to pin you.
I told you to watch for that foot plant. Come on.
here comes the sledgehammer.
did you see that?
come on! Get him! - Don't yell at him, control him.
slip right. Back step.
duck.
you're welcome. - Shut up! You're not helping!
actually, I think I am.
backhand. You got speed on this guy. Just keep moving. Bob.
slip out of that corner. Keep moving! Bob and weave!
that's it! Now you're listening to me.
he can take a hit. I'll give you this. Your bot can take a hit.
you better slip that headlock. This ain't gonna end well for you.
I'm trying!
thirty seconds!
thirty... Half a minute.
half a minute! Keep moving! Just move!
you've got 20 seconds!
that's a thousand bucks. Twenty seconds. Let me take over! - No.
move, then. Move!
come on.
get up, Atom. Get up, Atom.
count with me! Count with me! One!
get up! - He can't hear you... You know you're talking to a machine?
four! Five! Six!
get up, Atom!
all the way up! All the way up!
Yes! Yes!
I'm going to fix it!
I'm going to fix it! Come on, now.
this thousand bucks... - Yeah, thousand.
double or nothing he can't make another round.
Yeah, thanks anyway. - Deal. Double or nothing.
baby boy said it! We're back on! We on!
are you crazy? You threw away a thousand bucks!
he can barely stand up in there.
look. I really need the money.
I know. Let's work.
Jesus.
watch that. Watch that. - I got that.
I got it. - That's a system failure!
I don't got it. - He's going down.
Yes! - No!
start the count!
start the count!
one! Two! Three!
four! Five! Six! Seven!
eight! Nine!
ten!
you did it! We did it! Wow!
OK. Time to go. Come on. Grab your robot.
I know, I know! I know! I know!
kingpin, pay up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know, I know.
we owned! - Let's go. Come on, come on.
yeah? - Hey I got a fight for you.
Saturday night. Guaranteed four grand. Seven if he wins.
four grand? You're on. Let's go!
Hey, Bailey, it's me. He won.
can you believe that? The kid's robot actually won.
I know.
happy? Oh, my God. Yeah.
he's been bit. He's been bit real bad.
anyway...
I just wanted you to know.
jab, jab, hook.
jab, jab, hook.
I think you have to move your feet.
your feet. Feet.
nice moves, kid.
how long you been out here?
check it out.
I just spent the night doing something I think is amazing.
incredibly amazing. If it works, you know?
you know his remote was spotty? - Yeah.
I killed it. Got rid of it. We don't need it anymore.
how did you... ?
I had to start over.
but I was able to use the spin frame from Ambush and take the circuitry sleeve out of Noisy Boy, and it works.
he knows nothing, but it works. It really, really works.
what works?
I got to turn it on.
left jab, right uppercut!
Japan!
you put Noisy's voice recognition into Atom?
pretty smart, kid. - Smart?
it could be genius!
it could be the most incredible thing in the history of the entire world!
easy there, chief, easy. Did you drink all these sodas?
I might have had a few. I need you to teach him to box.
are you kidding me? He's nowhere near advanced enough to handle Noisy's voice command.
so he needs your moves. Your commands.
start over from the ground up. - Forget it.
you were a boxer.
yesterday at the Zoo, you could see things happen before they even happened.
I haven't boxed in a long time. I'm not starting now.
who's going to teach him to fight? - You're doing fine.
you don't need me. Sorry.
that was really cool, though, that dance.
you should do that on Saturday night.
don't make fun of me. - I'm serious.
before the fight, when you guys take the ring, you should do it.
there's no way I'm dancing with a robot in front of a boxing crowd.
a boxing crowd? Are you kidding me? This is just a show.
people want to see something they've never seen.
look. You think of all the greats.
think Ali, Sugar Ray, Prince Rakim, Gammer, they all had their nicknames.
they had their personas. They all had flair.
now you? You might not have much robot, but with that dance, you got flair.
Plus, you're a kid. People love that kid thing.
what are you? Like nine? Ten? - I'm 11.
are you sure you're 11?
Yes. I'm sure I'm 11.
OK. Anyway, the point is people want to see that.
you're really not messing with me?
I am not messing with you. They're going to love it.
cool. - But...
what? - I won't do it unless you help me.
I can't dance. You're on your own there.
no. Boxing.
Oh, I see. - I program the robot.
you teach him to box. - And you dance.
and you dance.
Yeah. - Yeah?
deal.
deal.
it's going to be cool.
nice.
you're going to be punching guys bigger. You're going to have to punch up.
that's it.
nice.
you, too, old man?
come on. Let's get to work.
nice! Let's do that again.
nice. Three-punch combo.
combo.
again. Again.
faster. Faster. Nice.
you're not even out of breath. I like it.
let's see how you move.
that's good.
step around! Left hook! Left hook!
that's it. Every time.
upper cut!
great fight, fellas.
105. 5, WRUT, the satellite home of robot boxing.
caller two, what do you got for me?
have you heard about this little bot out there, his name is Atom?
Oh, yeah.
my buddies and I saw him the other night, and he dances.
did you say "dances"? - You heard me.
he dances pre-fight with this little kid, and the crowd went nuts for these two.
you put the gimmick aside for a second, and I'm holding here a list of the bots he's beaten.
chaos. Wall Street. One-Eyed Jack. No slouches on that list, right?
atom's fought them all, beat them all.
this bot is fast! He escapes shots from these bigger bots, it's insane!
no doubt. I'm telling you, listeners, remember this name:
atom. That's right, A -T- O -M. This bot is one to watch.
awesome fight, sir. - Thanks, thanks.
great fight.
you guys put on a good show. - Thanks.
we'd like to invite you to fight on our card,
virgin America Spectrum Detroit, Friday night.
right. That's a WRB... That's a League fight.
damn right it is. What do you say, fellas? You ready for the show?
heck, yeah.
it's the undercard, but it's still a League fight. So...
I just want you to be relaxed. I want you to be relaxed. Ok, Max?
no freaking out. Don't get all freaky-deaky on me.
you go freaky-deaky, this whole thing can go south.
whatever you do, have fun, have fun. You got to have fun, you understand me?
we've come too far to get out there and freak out and blow this whole thing.
we're going to have fun, and we're going to not freak out!
we're going to stay loose, and we're just going to bam him.
I've spent my whole life waiting to get here. We're going to...
because I tell you what. Trust me when I say no freaking out. You got it?
Yeah, I got it. - Good.
you have been invited to Lemkova Suite. Follow me, please.
what was that? One more time.
Lemkova Suite. Zeus Suite.
sure. Yeah. Let's head up to the champ's suite. Sure.
Wow.
gentlemen, I'm Farra Lemkova. - Yeah. I'm Charlie Kenton, and...
and this, of course, is Tak Mashido.
holy shit. It's Tak Mashido.
I know you have a very important fight tonight, so I'll get right to it.
it's a little far from the action for my liking. It's nice. I like it, though.
very nicely... Wow. That's a great shot.
look at that. You want an autograph? Would you mind?
I'd like to buy your robot.
he'd be useful sparring bot for Zeus. And for that I'm willing to pay.
200000.0
done. - He's not for sale.
of course he is. We can definitely... - He's not for sale.
you are 15 minutes away from getting in the ring with Twin Cities, a vicious League bot.
so, to be clear, my offer stands until the starting bell.
OK. And just to be clear, he's not for sale!
not now, not ever.
give me a minute to clear this up, OK?
Tak, how are you? Max!
be smart. I know you love him, but in 20 minutes there may be nothing left to love.
think about it. Take the offer. - You think about it.
why does she want Atom? Because he's different from other bots!
Yeah, he's different. He's smaller, weaker, - and he's going to get his ass kicked. - He's a boxer.
we taught him to box. You taught him to box!
that's worth something. - I think it is, too.
I think it's worth 200 grand. Two hundred grand.
we can go round and round this all night long.
look at me...
but it's not going to happen.
I got a fight to get to.
ladies and gentlemen, tonight, the march towards the Real Steel Championship makes its way through Detroit's
virgin America Spectrum!
kicking off the evening, in our first undercard, the two-headed tyrant,
twin Cities!
opposing Twin Cities, in his first professional fight, hailing from parts unknown,
Atom!
nice work, boss. - Thanks.
did you switch him to fight mode? - Of course.
all right. This bot is tough to put down. - Atom can do it.
look over there. You see those geeks with the joysticks and consoles?
they're controlling everything their bot does.
they're monitoring his systems, seeing what he sees, stadium feeds of the fights and everything.
this is not like the underground handheld remote bots we've been fighting. This is the League. Stand on that.
so what do we do?
we fight smart, we be patient. And pray.
seriously, pray.
ready!
ready! - Hands up.
fighters ready! Fight!
engage.
slip! Right! Lean back. Right, left! Cover up!
duck! Left roundhouse!
damn it.
lean left! Lean right! Cover up! Cover up!
what's going on in there, Charlie? - He's taking too many hits.
get your hands up!
get out of that corner! Move!
come on, Charlie. He's getting killed in there! Tell him what to do!
that guy's got two heads, a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.
he's got to have a weakness. Find it!
wait, wait, wait.
right shoulder, right shoulder, right shoulder! He's got a tell!
he's got a hitch in his shoulder every time he throws that right bomb! - So?
so we got him! See? Here it comes again!
duck! Spin! Slide left! Roundhouse! One, two!
Backstep. Backstep. Backstep. Lean right.
come on, Charlie! Get in there!
got to get in close where he can't use that size and reach on us!
left to the body! Right to the body! Left to the body!
Yeah, it's working!
stay downstairs! Left, right, left!
these program modes aren't working. - Left! Right hook, slip!
right uppercut! Left uppercut! Duck left. Counter right!
get him, Atom! - Here comes the Charlie Special.
Three-punch combo to the body! Out! In! Counter!
Two-one-two! - Two-one-two.
stay on him! Lunging right!
don't let him go. Right to the body! Straight right to the head!
we got a systems crash!
get him, Atom!
this is not happening, man.
put him away, Charlie! - Spin left!
spin right!
finish him!
do it! - Right uppercut!
he's down!
one! Two! Three!
four! Five! Six!
we got him. Stay down!
he's out! He's out!
Yeah!
corner!
corner! Corner.
victory!
in a time of one minute, 47 seconds of the first round,
atom has defeat...
I want to thank everyone for coming out tonight!
our little bot from the junkyard got a shot at a League fight.
how about that?
and the last thing I want to say to a special girl who won't be named,
Farra Lemkova.
that instead of buying my robot, using your money to control this sport...
that's it! - I'm not done.
why not give the littlest guy the biggest shot?
because I bet if you give him a shot, he'll surprise you!
wouldn't you like to see a little guy get a shot at the Real Steel Championship?
I challenge Zeus to a fight.
any time, any place, anywhere!
you name it! We will be there!
I'm going to get us that fight!
atom, Atom, Atom...
that was a ballsy move, you challenging Zeus like that.
that's one thing to call it.
a lot of people would like to see that.
you're damn right they would. - You listening to this kid? Jeez!
good fight, fellas. - Thanks, man.
look at this. Let's celebrate. - Yeah.
all right, 70-30, right? - Yeah, 70 for me and 30 for you.
that's so right. - That's very funny.
I told you we shouldn't have sold him. - OK. No, no, no.
I remember now. Who's right? Say who's right. Say "Max is right."
all right, all right. All right.
we're a good team. - No, no. Max is right.
that was unbelievable. Thank you, Twin Cities.
we set? - Yeah.
let's do it. - Charlie boy.
Ricky, I was just going to call you. - Oh, yeah.
I actually really was going to call you.
don't worry about that.
that was a heck of a fight.
congratulations to both of you. That was good.
it was an amazing fight. That was a great job, young man.
come on, man. - What?
you serious? - You thought I was joking when I said I'd beat you within an inch of your life?
he thought that was a joke. It wasn't a joke.
I got a kid here. And I have your money. We don't have a problem.
I'm sure you do, but I think we know it's about much more than money, don't we?
all right. What do you want? You want 25, 30? You want 30 grand?
I got the money in cash here. - Yeah, right.
let's go! Max, go! Go, go! Run!
run! Come on. Keep up, keep up! - Get him now!
run! Come on!
get off him! Get off him!
come here!
Hey, Ricky.
that's his money! Leave him out of this!
stop!
stop!
take all his money. Take it all.
your friend's a real dirtbag, kid.
he's my father!
well. Looks like a little less than an inch of your life.
well, buddy, that will teach him.
just like old times, Charlie boy!
let's go, boys.
I'm sorry, Max. I'm sorry. Sorry.
what are we doing here? - Max, just...
is it Farra? She called you, didn't she? We're going to get the Zeus fight.
it's not the Zeus people. I've been thinking about all this, and...
Max!
it's so good to see you.
what is she doing here? - It's better if you go with her now.
we get beat up, so you call her to come and get me?
he's been beat up. I told you he couldn't take care of him!
Yeah. I called her. Look at us. We're a mess.
we're fine. She can leave!
atom's fighting good. We can make the money back.
Charlie, please.
just...
Charlie, we're doing so good.
Charlie, please, no.
don't. Don't. Don't.
please. Please.
trust me, kid. It's better this way, all right?
I know you think you know what's right, but you don't.
you're too young. You don't know.
look at me, trust me.
and legally she has custody, so what can I do?
what can I do?
I don't want your money, Marvin.
Max, we have our own swimming pool and we have a hot tub and a lot of super fun toys to play with.
do you want to play with them? It's going to be fun.
what's going on?
he won't even talk to me, so thanks for that, Charlie.
I'm going to wait in the car.
you don't want to talk, fine. I'll talk.
what do you want me to say? I'm sorry?
you knew from day one what this was.
you decided to take the ride.
you thought me, you, and a little robot from the junk heap were going to ride off into the sunset?
no, you forgot who I was!
you deserve better... than me.
will you say something, please?
I tried. What do you want from me?
I want you to fight for me.
that's all I ever wanted.
don't ask.
so no Max.
it's better this way. Marv and Debra have money. Max is set.
did you not see the way he looked at you?
that's the way I looked at my dad.
even now I would give anything to have that back.
your dad was special. He was in your corner from day one.
me, come on. I blew it.
I blew it.
when Max was born I just... freaked out.
but something would have been better than nothing.
I wouldn't know where to start.
Yeah, you do. - I don't.
you do. - No.
you do.
I got to go.
twelve hundred miles for a kiss.
worth it. Worth it.
go get him, Charlie.
you sound like your dad.
look, I know you think I abandoned you, and I guess I did originally.
then you sold me.
Charlie.
you have no business being here.
that's true. You've got full custody. He's yours.
and I know I've done all kinds of wrong by this kid, but if you'll let me...
I'd just like to do one thing right.
right.
where were we? - You sold me.
right, yeah, that happened.
wait, what? - Then we had our asses kicked.
and you slept on a shelf in a truck, and it was awful.
and dangerous. - Really dangerous.
I mean, I know. God. I'm sorry.
that's why you came? To say you're sorry?
no. I mean, yes. Yes.
but no. No, I came to tell you that I heard you.
I got it. I'm a little slow, but I got it.
I know you had a bum ride, and I wasn't there and I should have been.
I should have been.
your mom was...
she was cool, wasn't she?
she was.
she was the coolest.
Yeah, she was.
and I'm sorry about... what happened with her.
and I can't get those years back, Max, but I'm here right now...
and if you're up for it, I'm ready to fight.
we got the Zeus fight.
what?
no, no, we didn't.
you got the Zeus fight.
so what do you say, Debra?
can we do this one last thing?
one night. - It's all we need. Thank you.
we'll probably get our asses kicked, but at least we'll go down swinging.
yeah? What do you say?
welcome to New York's Bing Arena and the Real Steel Championship Bout.
Tim, it's the fight we never thought we'd see.
Zeus, the undefeated WRB champion, against the underdog, rising star Atom.
the champ's handlers have agreed to fight outside the circle of well-known League bots, and have decided to give the people a true David versus Goliath spectacle.
now, Tim, help me out on this. Has the Zeus camp lost their mind?
the greatest robot boxer of all time gives a shot at the belt to a G-2 named Atom?
well, Herb, if you ask Tak Mashido, Team Zeus has lost their minds.
now, he may look cool as he enters the arena, but he has made no bones about his disdain for this matchup.
our cameras tried to catch up with him earlier this week.
look at this clip. Mashido wouldn't even stop to talk to the press, referring only to this fight as an insult to his creation.
now, Max Kenton, Atom's trainer, did more than just challenge Zeus.
he did so publicly.
the challenge went viral and created a PR nightmare for the champ.
no argument there. And I think the Zeus camp knows exactly what they're doing.
that they do. Come on.
giving a shot at the belt to a nobody from nowhere.
this "junkyard dog," if you will. That's a marketing stunt.
and judging from this crowd, that stunt is working.
we can't win, can we?
we'll see.
as the challenger makes his way into the arena, you can hear the surge of excitement.
atom has arrived onto the WRB scene with a vengeance, using a style, some would call it human-like, that bot fighting has rarely seen.
atom and his pint-size trainer step into the ring and the look on Farra Lemkova's face says it all.
welcome to the bigs, junior!
I'm giving one-to-five odds that Atom don't make it out the first round.
who wants some?
I'll take some of that action.
Hey, there! I'll take some of that action.
how's it going... partner?
partner?
that's great. How about a hundred K? Is that funny?
hundred K says Atom doesn't see round two.
you carrying around that kind of scratch?
Yeah. - Hundred K?
tell you what. Remember section 101, row C, and you can bring me my money right to my seat.
101, row C? Hundred K?
you heard me, homey.
homey? - Right?
homeboy!
all right. Peace out, posse.
come on, sugar. Let's go.
never beaten. - It's showtime!
never threatened.
the king of the ring, the ruler of robots!
bow down to the mighty Zeus!
Oh, shit!
that was awesome.
come on, let's go.
ladies and gentlemen, in a bout scheduled for five rounds for the World Robot Boxing Championship, in the corner to my right, the challenger, Atom!
Showboat!
and in the corner to my left, the undeniable champion of this universe and any other universe known or unknown, the mighty Zeus!
and now, ladies and gentlemen, are you ready for Real Steel!
this is what it's all about!
there's the starting bell and we are underway.
the bots emerge from their corners.
Zeus decks Atom, and he is already down.
on your feet!
looks like we are in for another Zeus clinic.
referee Matt Geiger coming in the ring to start the count.
get up!
push up! Stand up!
but look at this. The little bot's back on his feet to get a second blistering attack from Zeus!
atom is down for the second time in less than ten seconds.
he's too strong! - That's my boy right there!
get up and get in the game!
come on! No, please Atom, get up! Please!
get up! Get up! Get up!
once again, the challenger finds his feet!
lean back!
atom's getting pummeled into the corner!
get out of there! - Move!
a demolishing inside shot.
get your hands up!
hands up!
crush that little can!
get out of the corner!
Kenton desperately trying to command his robot out of that suicide corner.
get your feet under you!
good night, sparring bot!
it might have taken Zeus a bit longer, but he's done it again!
atom is down for the third and possibly final time tonight.
stand up! - Two!
atom, get up!
get up, Atom. - Get up, Atom.
six! Seven! - Get up!
I don't believe this! Against all odds, this little bot is on his feet again.
come on, Atom!
he can't survive this!
come on, Charlie! - Right uppercut!
atom has landed a punch!
Zeus is stunned as he reels back from an uppercut that he never saw coming!
advance!
fade back, counter right!
fade back, counter right!
right cross! Right cross! Right cross! Left hook!
let's go! Come on! - Take him down!
for the first time in his dominant run,
Zeus has met a bot who simply won't back down!
the crowd is going nuts! Zeus gives it everything he's got as we reach the last 15 seconds of round one!
Zeus corners Atom, going double duty with both fists!
downtown, uptown, as the clock winds down!
hands up, chin down. - Stay low, stay low!
only five seconds left, as here comes that monster piston-packed right of the champ!
there's the bell! I don't believe it. Somehow Atom has survived.
we will have a second round. And the crowd here is thrilled!
he made it! Yeah! Corner!
we got to get out of here. We got to get out of here now!
we got to go this way. Come on!
OK, you sit down.
let's go, homey. - All right.
I'll be back for you, baby.
get your hands off me!
both corners furiously working on their bots.
this crowd came here tonight expecting a massacre, but instead they're getting a war!
you got it? - Yeah.
all right. Here we go.
what is happening?
he is fully prepared for all possible contingencies. He will be fine.
what next?
round two.
round two kicks off, and incredibly the challenger, Atom, is giving the champ a run for his money.
Zeus tosses the smaller bot across the ring like a tin can!
Kenton working his bot with a trifecta of straight rights to the champ's dome!
toe-to-toe they stand, trading deafening blows!
whatever strategy either corner had cooked up has been destroyed!
metal bashing metal. Steel smashing steel.
this is a brawl!
the crowd is on their feet, watching two machines driven to kill each other!
something has to give, and it does!
atom goes down again!
lights out for the junkyard dog who put on a heck of a show here tonight!
and yet again, Atom rises up.
Kenton must have hardwired this bot with the will to go on!
midway through round four, and Zeus is looking to end this thing right now.
the champ is holding nothing back as he cracks open the hurt locker!
atom is stumbling around the ring, apparently disoriented and dazed!
hands up! - What's going on?
I think the voice recog is shot! He's not responding!
Zeus has found yet another gear of violence, drilling Atom's midsection.
No! Stop! Do something!
he can't hear me!
but the bell sounds, and once again this little robot has stunned the world!
we're done, Max! He can't hear me. This is murder. We've had enough.
I'm disabling the voice recognition. - He can't hear me!
Yes, but he can see you! - What?
I'm putting him in shadow mode. Show him what to do.
without the voice recognition, he'll move even faster!
no way. No way!
look at them. They are freaking out!
rich girl is ripping him a new one over there!
do you know why? Because they're scared.
because Atom can do things no other bot has ever done.
but I can't do it! - Yes, you can.
I can't. - Yes, you can.
show him what to do. You have to fight the last round.
don't ask me. Don't.
Charlie... please. I beg you.
are you kidding me with those eyes?
damn it!
Yes!
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I know you're in there! I'm not sure if you're getting this or what, but I know you're in there!
Kenton. In or out? - In. Give me a minute.
I know you can't hear me, but you can see me, so watch me!
watch... me.
you know you're talking to a robot. - I know. Shut up.
watch me.
an epic battle being waged here tonight, as the fifth and final round gets underway.
come on, Atom!
wait a second. Are you seeing this?
Charlie Kenton is shadowboxing just outside the ring!
it looks like Atom has a shadow function.
so, basically, that means Charlie Kenton is fighting the last round of this fight against Zeus.
it doesn't seem to help, because Atom is backed up against the ropes again.
help him! Fight back!
not yet.
Tak Mashido supervising personally as Zeus hammers down, furiously trying to end this thing once and for all.
I got to tell you, folks, the champ looks tired.
this robot seems to be running on empty.
I don't believe it. Atom is taunting Zeus.
switch to turbo! - He's actually asking for more.
please do something!
not yet. - That's right, Charlie. Not yet.
nitrous pistons, now!
he's not going to last much longer!
fight back! - Not yet.
hang in there!
atom is riddled with the nitrous-fueled Gatling guns of Zeus's blows!
Atom! Atom! Atom! Atom!
wait him out, wait him out! Not yet!
Zeus is slowing down!
the champ's power core is clearly depleted.
Charlie, please!
Hey, kid.
now. - Now!
get in there!
knock that little bitch! Bust him open!
Yeah! That's right!
do something!
move!
override. Switching to manual.
in a shocking move, Tak Mashido is manually operating his robot personally!
work the body! Get inside him! - Get him, Atom!
look at this! The champ is trying desperately to stay on his feet, but Kenton is relentless, landing blow after blow after blow to the body!
left! Right! Left! Right!
a huge uppercut by Atom! Zeus is down!
this little bot has dug deep here tonight and shown something damn near heart!
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
he's good!
Zeus gets to his feet, but Kenton has Atom on him again, landing punch after punch!
Tak Mashido and his super bot have no answer.
Zeus pins Atom's left arm, but Kenton is undaunted!
it all comes down to this, folks!
drop him, Charlie! Now!
Kenton is about to drop the champ... - No! There's the bell!
Zeus is saved by the bell!
amazingly, we will go to the judges' cards!
ladies and gentlemen, after five rounds, we go to the judges' scorecards.
judge Number One scores the fight 47-48.
judge Number Two scores the fight 48-46.
and Judge Number Three scores the fight 47-46, for the winner and still World Robot Boxing champion,
Zeus!
Farra Lemkova, you got way more than you bargained for tonight.
some would say that your bot won the decision but lost the fight.
she looks pissed.
it took a little longer than we thought, but the result is as expected.
we won. Zeus is still undefeated.
any comment on the absolutely humiliating near loss your bot suffered tonight?
nothing. - No comment.
Max. Where's Max?
there he is. Max.
they're already calling your bot "the people's champion."
what do you say to that?
people's champion?
sounds pretty good to me.
dad? Dad!
dad!
I really want you to know...
no, I need you to know.
don't worry.
your secret's safe with me.
wait here. Wait here.
Yes!
before YOU WERE BORN, YOUR MOM AND I SOLD YOUR SOUL TO THE DEVIL.
I'm THE DEVIL!
you're JUST GOING TO BRING ESCAPED SOULS BACK TO HELL. YOU KNOW, LIKE A BNTY HUNTER.
you GONNA TELL ANDI? NO!
I'm NOT GONNA TELL ANDI! IF SHE KNOWS, SHE'LL THINK I'M A FREAK.
she'll NEVER GO OUT WITH ME.
you CAN MAKE HER GO OUT WITH YOU.
Sam, I LIKE YOU. I LOVE WORKING WITH YOU GUYS.
and HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CAPTURE THEM?
this WILL HELP. A VESSEL.
handcrafted IN THE BOWELS OF PERDITION
how DO YOU CAPTURE A SOUL WITH IT?
maybe YOU DRIVE IT INTO THE GUY, RIGHT?
you FINALLY FOUND THE ONE THING THAT YOU'RE GOOD AT,
and YOU KICKED ASS. YOUR DECODER WE KICKED ASS.
Oh!
I DID IT.
you're DEAD.
you're DEAD.
you're DEAD!
Ah, I'M DEAD.
give ME A BITE OF THAT.
no, NO, I NEED YOU TO FEED IT TO ME.
what? I'M STARVING, OK?
everything I PUT IN MY MOUTH ENDS UP COVERED IN BUGS.
Oh, NICE.
so BUGS, HUH?
you THINK THAT'S THE WORK OF, UH, EL DIABLO?
it MUST BE.
time TO COLLECT A SOUL THAT'S ESCAPED FROM HELL.
I JUST WISH THE DEVIL WOULD DO IT IN A LESS DISGUSTING WAY.
all RIGHT, COME ON. OPEN UP, BABY BIRD.
Mmm. TILT IT BACK.
get IT, GET IT REAL-- MORNING.
no, PLEASE CONTINUE.
very ROMANTIC, ACTUALLY.
this STAHA, YEAH, NO, IT'S - MY HANDS ARE DIRTY.
Sam, WHAT TIME ARE YOU OFF WORK TONIGHT?
seven. WHY?
there's A PRIMATE LECTURE ON CAMPUS TONIGHT.
they're BRINGING IN A LOWLANDS GORILLA EXPERT.
I COULD USE YOUR COMPANY.
Really?
I JUST FIGURED WE COULD GET A CUP OF COFFEE AFTERWARDS
with SOME PEOPLE IN CLASS.
so WHAT DO YOU SAY? YOU, ME AND THE MONKEYS?
um, YEAH, WELL, ACTUALLY,
uh - AHH. SOCK AND I MADE PLANS TO HANG OUT, SO...
Yep. YEAH.

Oh-ho. THAT'S RIGHT.
bone MARROW?
pardon ME, IDIOT, BUT I THINK ANDI JUST ASKED YOU OUT ON A DATE.
no, IT WASN'T A DATE, OK? IT WAS A LECTURE,
and I DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE EVENING FEELING STUPID IN FRONT OF HER COLLEGE FRIENDS.
whatever, MAN. SHE WAS ALL UP IN YOUR GRILL PIECE,
and YOU TOLD HER TO TAKE A HIKE. GOOD JOB.
it's JUST...
I'm SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE
you HAD SUCH A FULL CALENDA RIGHT NOW.
my LIFE IS COMPLICATED, OK?
if WE ACTUALLY WENT ON A DATE, IT WOULD BE A TOTAL DISASTER.
you KNOW WHAT? I'M SICK OF THAT OLD SONG AND DANCE, OK?
my NAME'S SAM, I GATHER SHOPPING CARTS FOR A LIVING,
I COLLECT SOULS FOR THE DEVIL.
boohoo. ZERO PITY.
you're GONNA HAVE TO DO BETTER THAN THAT.
well?
see, NOW I THINK THAT'S COOL.
you EVER FEEL LOST, SAM?
what? LOST.
aimless, LACKING PURPOSE.
believe ME, I CAN RELATE.
I WASN'T ALWAYS THE MANAGER.
I HAD TO EARN IT.
but I HAD TO SHAKE OFF SOME SERIOUS ADDICTION ISSUES
before I FOUND DIRECTION IN MY LIFE.
you WERE ADDICTED TO DRUGS?
gambling.
and SHOES.
lots OF SHOES.
point IS, SAM, IS THAT I TURNED MY LIFE AROUND.
and THERE'S STILL HOPE FOR YOU.
hope IN THE FORM OF TOILETS.
toilets?
for 2,000 YEARS,
people HAVE BEEN USING THESE PORCELAIN THRONES,
and THEY'RE GONNA BE USING THEM FOR ANOTHER 2,000.
um, YEAH, I JUST HAVE NO INTEREST IN SELLING TOILETS,
so...
I SEE A SPARK OF THE OLD ME IN YOU, YOU KNOW?
please DON'T TELL ME THAT, TED.
and THAT'S WHY I AM PREPARED...
to PROMOTE YOU
to ASSISTANT MANAGER OF THE PLUMBING DEPARTMENT.
what DO YOU THINK OF THEM APPLES?
I THINK I WANT TO STAB MYSELF.

Yeah, IT'S JUST...
my DESTINY DOES NOT INCLUDE SPENDING THE REST OF MY LIFE AT THE WORK BENCH.
you KNOW, I HAVE PLANS TO DO SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE.

I DON'T WANT TO BE MISERABLE MY WHOLE LIFE.

first I WOULD TEAR THIS BUILDING DOWN BRICK BY BRICK,
then I WOULD GO HOME, LOCK MYSELF IN THE BATHROOM,
and STARE AT MY BOOBS FOR AS LONG AS I WANTED.
Yeah. WHICH WOULD BE A LONG TIME.
and THEN TED WOULD HAVE NO POWER OVER YOU.
testify.
Oh, SAM.
what's THAT?
what?
I COULD GO FOR ONE OF THESE APPLES. YOU?
what THE HELL HAPPENED HERE?
AHH?
OH--OH, MY GOD.
we
we NEED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE.
no, SAM. IT'S OK.
there's NO POINT.
he's DEAD ALREADY.
you KNOW, ONE DAY YOU'RE COMING HOME, HAPPY AS A CLAM,
and THEN BOOM,
you're GONE.
that's THE WAY LIFE IS, SAM.
you've GOT TO EAT YOUR APPLES WHILE YOU CAN.
so, LET ME GUESS,
an ESCAPED SOUL FROM HELL DID THIS.
that's VERY GOOD.
you're START TO CATCH ON TO THIS.
but YOU KNOW WHAT THE FUNNY THING IS?
the CORONER'S GONNA BLAME THIS GUY'S DEATH ON THE CAR CRASH.
the TRUTH?
this FELLOW DIED WHILE THE CAR WAS STILL MOVING.
how?
who KNOWS?
it's LIKE...

OK, SO WHERE'S THE SOUL?
I'm NOT GOOGLE, SAM.

Ah.
well, HERE'S THE THING ABOUT THAT, SAMMY.
when YOUR PARENTS SIGNED THE CONTRACT FOR YOUR SOUL,
they DIDN'T THINK TO ASK ABOUT VACATION DAYS,
so YOU DON'T GET THEM.
so THAT'S IT? I WORK FOR YOU FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE?
no VACATION, NOTHING?
Yeah.
and I'M AFRAID I WON'T BUDGE ON THIS.
sets A BAD PRECEDENT.
God, YOU SOUND LIKE TED.

Ted IS A REAL DOUCHE BAG.
Yeah, WELL, THE TRUTH HURTS.
you PUSH ME AROUND, YOU KNOW.

No! I'M SORRY, OK?
I REFUSE TO ACCEPT YOUR POWER OVER ME, ALL RIGHT?
I'm NOT YOUR MACHINE.
I TRUST I'VE MADE MY POINT.
loud AND CLEAR.
what IS IN THAT THING?
whatever IT IS, IT WAS FORGED IN HELL.

the DEVIL MIGHT LET ME GO TO THE CONCERT WITH ANDI.
Yeah, 'CAUSE HE'S A REAL PEACH LIKE THAT.

it's MESSED UP.
I KNOW, RIGHT?
I MEAN YOU'D THINK THAT SEEING SCARFACE ALL THOSE TIMES???
why'd THE MAGICIAN KILL THAT GUY?
I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL LIKE HE HATES THE AUDIENCE.
like HE BLAMES THEM FOR HIS CRAPPY CAREER WHEN HE WAS ALIVE.
well, AT LEAST WE KNOW WHERE HE'S GONNA BE.
the NEXT PERFORMANCE IS TOMORROW AT NOON,
which MEANS WE NEED TO ASK TED FOR TIME OFF.
what ARE YOU DOING? - NOTHING.
let ME...
you NEED HELP.
I'm WORRIED ABOUT WINSTON.
he's INNOCENT IN ALL THIS.
what ABOUT ME, MAN? I'M AN INNOCENT.
you're NOT FEEDING ME PRETZELS AND NESTLING ME TO YOUR BREAST.
OK, THAT'S JUST GROSS.
because YOU SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH THE DEVIL, SAM.
no, I DID NOT.
you DIDN'T SIGN ANYTHING?
no. NO, MY PARENTS DID.
that's WEIRD.
says THE GUY WITH THE SHIRT FULL OF BIRD.
dude, YOU SHOULD REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT CONTRACT.
that's NOT COOL YOUR PARENTS SOLD YOUR SOUL TO THE DEVIL WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT.
isn't THAT RIGHT, LITTLE MAN?
Yeah, THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
see IF MY PARENTS HAVE A COPY OF THE CONTRACT SOMEWHERE.
Hey, GOOD MORNING. YOU'RE UP EARLY.
Yeah. HEY.

which CONTRACT IS THAT?
UH...IT'S...

what DO YOU WANT TO SEE THAT FOR?
well, I JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD SEE IT.
you KNOW WHAT?
you're RIGHT.
you DESERVE TO SEE IT.
OK, UH, LET ME THINK.
where DID WE PUT THAT?
well, WHAT'S IN THERE?
this IS YOUR MEMENTO BOX.
I HAVEN'T LOOKED IN HERE IN YEARS.
Heh HEH.
you PUT THE CONTRACT FOR MY SOUL WITH MY THIRD-GRADE REPORT CARDNT. AND ...
Mr. HUGGLES?
Yeah, YOU'RE RIGHT.
it's NOT GONNA BE IN HERE.
OK, MAYBE YOUR DAD KNOWS WHERE IT IS.
Oh. WELL, UH...

Yes. JOHN, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU CAN'T GET A HANDLE ON THE PAPERWORK.
we HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO FILING SYSTEM.

I... HOW ABOUT YOU--YOU OWN MY SOUL?
you WON'T LET ME TAKE ANY VACATIONS.
I MEAN, THE CONTRACT YOU GAVE MY PARENTS JUST TURNED TO DUST!
forget ABOUT THE CONTRACT.

but WHY?
because I WANT TO KNOW MY RIGHTS.
Oh, THAT'S EASY.
you DON'T HAVE ANY.
go AROUND!
go TO HELL, JERK!
I'll MEET YOU THERE, BRUCE!
you KNOW THAT LITTLE THING ON HIS NECK?
not A FRECKLE.
OK...

Yes, IT FEELS WEIRD.

Oh.
Yeah, RIGHT. I DID, DIDN'T I?

I FEEL CRAPPY. I FEEL AWFUL.

I WANT THE CONTRACT.
what DO YOU HAVE?
a DEATH WISH?

because...
you NEED ME.
I-- I NEED THAT CONTRACT.
see, WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOU, SAMMY?
all RIGHT, JUST CAN'T SAY NO.
all RIGHT. I'LL TALK TO THE GUYS DOWNSTAIRS
and SEE IF THEY CAN DIG UP A DRAFT, ALL RIGHT?
filing SYSTEM IN THE ABYSS IS ...
shabby, AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT, BUT UH...
OK? FAIR ENOUGH?
Yes. THANK YOU.
Yeah, WELL...
Ahem. WHAT THE HECK.
I'll HAVE WHAT HE'S HAVING.

exactly.
the LADY DOTH PROTEST TOO MUCH, METHINKS.
Thanks.
do YOU-- DO YOU REALLY THINK SO?
trust ME, BUDDY.
I DO KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT THE HUMAN ANIMAL.
it's that simple.
Hey! Hi. I'm coach Roy.
when I get hot under the collar...
I cool off with Cool Breeze.
[Man] See, Coach Roy is slippin; because right now...
his best statistic on the season-eight technical fouls in his last eight games.
that's hardly championship coaching. - [Audience Laughing]
[Man] You ate eight hamburgers at lunch.
look, the fact is this. Roy has lost touch with the fundamentals...
and he's also lost touch with his team.
y'all can take some pictures, but I'm not gonna be able to sign any autographs right now.
as you can see, I'm very busy.
Roy better get his stuff together, because otherwise, he'll be coaching at Devry.
and they don't even have a basketball team.
and that's the joke, see?
[Coach Roy] Okay, guys, real important game today.
I need you to be 100%.
unfortunately, I can't be there. I'm doin' a photo shoot for Details magazine.
it's gonna run late. I'll be there at halftime, and you'd better not lose...
because losing makes me look bad. - [Tape Clicks]
[Man] Coach Roy cannot be happy right now, Jack.
his team has a lot of work to do, and not much time to do it.
it is crunch time. This is where we're gonna find out...
what these two teams and their coaches are really made of.
[Whistle Blowing] - What are you callin'?
what are you callin', Earl? Earl, what is that? What is that?
keep it up, Roy. Just one more word.
Hey, coach, this is my nest! This is my nest!
you need to do an endorsement for Altoids. Your breath is humming!
Hey, clown.
you keep runnin' your mouth, I'm gonna come over there and rearrange your beak.
you talkin' smack? You talkin' smack, huh? You talkin' smack?
shut up.
no basket. - What?
why don't we play jacks? 'Cause we're not playin' basketball.
[Whistle Blowing] - Technical foul, coach Roy.
I - I was way over there!
that's two. You're out of here!
just because - did I do this? - Don't touch my whistle.
did I do that? Did I do that?
that's why you give me a tech! - [Referee] Hit the showers.
no, you hit the showers, Earl! You hit the showers!
I'm not hittin' no showers!
[Laughing] Yeah! Kick him out! Kick him out!
y'all didn't even ask me what went on. Y'all just snatched me.
you know what?
coach Roy killed Victor!
[Booing, Shouting] - You're crazy!
I feel bad. I feel real bad.
out there havin' temper tantrums and arguin' with the refs.
man, I should know better than that.
you represent everything that's wrong with college sports today.
you don't care about the players. You don't care about the game.
if things don't go your way, you explode like a spoiled child.
look, if you're gonna fine me, fine me, man.
how much? 'Cause I ain't got all day.
it's time for me to bounce. What's happenin'?
it is with such pleasure that I say...
that you, Roy McCormick...
that you're officially banned from coaching in the N.C.B.A. For the remainder of your life.
you bannin' me, huh? Yeah. Okay.
I been here longer than all y'all.
you forgot about the three championships I won, didn't you, Mr. Vice President? Huh?
and now you wanna ban me? No, I'm bannin' you. I'm bannin' you for life.
can he ban us? - Of course not! Stand up straight.
excuse me, gentlemen. "Prior to a lifetime ban... offending coach must be granted an opportunity to demonstrate compliance."
if offending coach completes the remainder of the season without any infractions
ejections, criminal malfeasance, etcetera
he must be readmitted on a probationary basis.
in short, you gotta give Roy one last chance to prove himself.
watch your temper, Roy. Good luck finding another team.
we should go.
and then, I'm gonna smash the guitar.
good, 'cause if you don't, I will.
dad call?
he comin' to this game?
[Sighs] Keep practicin', okay?
come on. We're late.
Hey, hold it. Hold it.
okay, look. I would love to tell you...
that everybody you meet in this life was gonna be great...
and you could always count on those people.
that'd be a lie. Your dad's not a part of our lives anymore, all right?
but I got your back, and I'm gonna keep havin' your back.
so before you go givin' up on this world...
you need to wait till you're about 18 like everybody else, all right?
mom, if you're so smart, how'd you end up with Dad in the first place?
okay, you know what? You're too smart for your own good.
I'll see you at the tip-off. - All right, Mom.
because if I hadn't, l - I wouldn't have had you.
I wouldn't have had you.
I always think of the good mom stuff after he's gone. Crazy.
it's game day here at Mount Vernon.
let's take a moment to review the Smelters' starting lineup.
first off, we have Keith Ellis.
now, everyone knows Keith Ellis is the best player on the team, including Keith.
[Girl #2] At power forward is One Love.
okay, now, the only thing One Love loves more than playing basketball... is his shoes, um...
his hair, his image, and his shoes again.
at point guard, we've got Ralph.
the kid has got four older brothers, okay?
all of them were all-star athletes.
I mean, the pressure to succeed is tremendous. - [Vomiting]
returning as small forward is the player with the best attitude...
and the worst vision.
last year, he held the record for the most balls to the face.
luckily, this year, he has a solution. - And a new nickname, Annie.
everyone's callin'the kid Goggles.
rounding out the starting five is Fuzzy.
now, we have high expectations for the kid.
I mean, word on the street is that he's been bulking up...
specifically for this season.
and, of course, the coach of our intrepid team and home ec teacher...
Mr. Newirth.
while he's never coached before or even played the game ofbasketball...
he proved to the administration he was exactly what they were looking for.
Oh, yeah? How?
he volunteered for the job. - Okay.
get a shoe contract yet, One Love?
not yet. - Bam!
your deal.
court's free. You little guys wanna warm up?
what for?
want a cookie?
you spit on this? - No.
all right. - [Girl] Game nine, and the pressure is on.
but you couldn't tell by looking at the calm, confident faces of the Smelters...
easily the best 0-8 team in the league...
hungry to avenge their nail-biting loss last week.
86 to zero.
in which the Smelters were subjected to several hundred bad calls.
[All] Break!
[One Love] One Love's cutting! One Love's open!
one Love is open!
one Love has the ball!
here! Pass it! Right here, Keith! Right here!
[Keith] Man, if we had Coach Roy, we'd never lose.
Touchdown! - Oh, here's the
[Audience Cheering] - All right, our next guest...
is looking to get back into the game he loves, and this time...
he promises not to ruffle any more feathers.
[Arnold] Aw! - Please welcome the former head coach at Ohio Polytech...
Hey! - How are ya?
Roy, you're a man of your word. You said you'd come on the show when you were available.
and, brother, you are really available now.
well, you know, I'm weighin' my options. I'm a free agent, baby.
[Applause] - My fans!
word on the street is you couldn't get a job right now fielding sheep.
look, I wanna go somewhere where- where the desire to win is just great, you know.
cause y'all know I'm a winner, and l - I kind of wanna go back to my roots.
[Coach Roy] That's right. - Come with me.
come on. I got a plan. Come on.
anything yet? - It's ringing.
there? - Mm-hmm.
I'll get it. Stay. - Whatever.
[Coach Roy] Man, this is a junior high.
I won three N.C.B.A. Championships. I mean, what do I gotta do?
Roy, don't you see it? It's perfect. It's your old school.
look, we accept their offer.
you work with these kids for a week. They get a huge thrill out of it.
duh! You look like a saint...
and we get free P.R. which, no offense, Roy, we desperately need.
in the meantime, it'll give me a chance to land us a solid job offer.
what offers do we have now? - Hmm?
Doreen, this is the supplemental budget.
could you get me the full budget, please?
hon, that is the full budget.
tim Fink, principal partner, the Fink Agency. Fink Fast!
principal, Mount Vernon Junior H
Whoo! Whoa! Wow! Okay, it's coach Roy.
coach Roy is in the house.
[Whispering] Coach Roy is here. It's my house.
all right. Well, then, gentlemen - Uh-oh!
community service? Did you get arrested for something?
we get more great sports guys that way.
we're here to accept your offer.
Yea! No idea what you're talking about.
your offer.
Mm-hmm. Oh, my.
Oh, my goodness.
just
s - Spelling error.
so you're telling me that Roy McCormick...
wants to coach here?
am I gettin' Punk'd?
Roy's gonna work with your team.
they're gonna be coached by the best of the best...
for absolutely - wait for it - no charge.
[Coach Roy] Yeah, I wanna give back to the community.
you know, here's where I found my first true love, which is basketball.
well, teamwork. So I guess that's two loves.
two loves. - Mm-hmm.
that was very inspiring, coach.
well, uh, gosh, gentlemen.
I guess
follow me.
[Principal Walsh] People. Apparently...
some of you have tried to circumvent school policy...
and hire a new head coach on your own.
well, I'm impressed.
without further ado, please welcome your new head coach.
they're really short.
Yeah, they're 13.
all right, well, good luck, kids.
and, uh, behave yourself.
[Keith] Oh, we will.
I was talking to him.
coach Roy, I'm a big fan. I've seen all your commercials.
a couple things I should warn you about.
Ralph here, for instance, when he gets nervous, he pukes.
you my assistant head coach? - Real honor working with you.
Yeah, I appreciate it. Well, uh, why don't you run and fetch me a patty melt?
maybe one with your arms around the kids having fun?
Yeah, sure thing.
huh? Got it? That's right.
y'all look basketball style.
we're never gonna lose again. - Yeah.
one Love's definitely on the way to getting a shoe contract now.
Yeah! - How you feeling, Ralph?
[Vomiting] - Oh!
Oh! Priceless.
y'all run some drills. All right?
I'm gonna try to get this guck off my shoe.
excuse me, Mr. Photographer.
we don't know any drills. - Or have any skills.
we'll just have to make some up then. Come on.
okay, great drill. Let's run our passing drill now.
come on.
let's step it up.
[Sighs] - Mary, is it really a good idea?
you know, Jeanie, you may find this hard to believe...
but I don't get a lot of gifts here at Mount Vernon.
I got no money. I got no resources. I got no nothin'.
excuse me. That's a double negative.
Bethanne, stick it where the sun don't not shine.
so, when one of the best coaches in basketball wants to coach my kids for free...
kids who, incidentally, are on their way to another no-win season...
I'm not gonna say no.
Oh, okay. Great, great. So that's the criteria?
if he's never hit a kid, then he can work at Mount Vernon.
Yeah, I know. But check it out.
if he steps out of line in any way...
all we have to do is call the N.C.B.A. and he's out of here.
so I think he's gonna be on his best behavior.
okay, how are you gonna run a school and monitor a madman?
well, Jeanie, I'm not.
Uh-uh! No, no, no, no, no! I'm not either.
uh, uh, uh- - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
you go to all the games anyway. You could be my eyes and ears.
Yeah. The minute you say he's out of line, he's gone.
come on. Girls, trust me.
coach Roy is going to do wonders for this school.
coach Roy has some issues- - Uh!
that he needs to work- - Uh!
a little bit...
out.
[Chattering] - Stop. Stop. Stop.
[Goggles] You really bleed a lot. High blood pressure.
too much stress. - What's that? CK-One?
how much do they pay you to put that on your hankie? - Let me smell it.
look, I don't care how many titles he's won.
I don't care anything about that. I know his reputation.
come on. Give him a chance. - For what?
he's got some problems, and if he touches my son
stay away from my son!
[Keith] Mom, he didn't hit anybody.
yet. He just got here. Give him a chance.
we hit him and barfed on him.
Plus, his Escalade got tagged.
[Groans] - But he doesn't know that yet.
look, I'm sorry.
my name is Jeanie, and it's just my son means a lot to me.
look, uh. - Excuse me. Miss Jeanie?
now, look, I know my reputation precedes me.
but it's just rep, you know? It's not true.
Roy McCormick. Very nice to meet you.
I know who you are. My son idolizes you.
well, your son, he's-he's a good kid.
I think he's gonna do big things in this game.
he's gonna be all right. - Well, that's good to know, because that's not my son.
that's my son.
he's gonna be good too, 'cause they-they run drills together, so they kind of know the same drills.
and, quite frankly, I don't like the way you treat your players.
my son doesn't need some hotshot egomaniac...
trying to tell him he's good, because he is good.
ma'am - Miss Jeanie, look, I swear...
the only reason I'm here is - is to help these kids.
I wouldn't do anything to hurt 'em. Now, that temper tantrum thing is long gone.
well, it was nice meeting you.
very nice meetin' you.
if you don't mind, maybe I can call you sometime or somethin'?
I don't think so.
dude, Roy's checking out your mom.
he ain't lyin'.
coach Roy, what's it like coming back to coach at your old school?
it's a'ight, you know, and, you know
I grew up in the mean streets - the suburbs.
okay? I had one dream, and that was to get out...
not end up here like these losers...
who, I guess, I would love to give back to.
for such a great coach, he really doesn't do much, does he?
no.
there's a game today? - That's why we're in uniform.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
you don't remember me, do you?
I applied to be your assistant coach seven times.
you said that I was too rigid.
turns out I wasn't so rigid, I couldn't lead the Vikings to nine state championships.
Wow. I didn't know middle schools had state championships.
well, they do, and I won them nine times.
nine times? Big kudos for ya.
F.Y.I. The only kid you need to look out for on my team is my son, Larry Jr.
all right, well, good luck, man.
you're in my house!
this is my world! You be in my world now!
no mercy. - [Whistle Blowing]
one, two, three. - [All] No mercy!
let's get some!
Oh! Way downtown! Yeah!
one Love is cutting! One Love is open!
one Love has the ball! One Love is shaking! One Love is baking!
Aah! My shoe!
aren't you supposed to be doing something?
Yeah, I'm thinking about what I'm gonna eat for lunch. You interested?
Keith, I'm open! - [One Love] One Love is wide open!
pass the ball! - Keith, One Love is open!
has your kid ever heard of passin'?
we had position, ref! Where's the call?
[Whistle Blowing] - Charge!
Oh! Thank you!
are you kiddin' me? That was 10 minutes ago.
Oh. [Chuckles]
that's our ref - "Late" Carl Freedburg.
he's a good guy. He's a little slow on the whistle, though.
Keith, pass. - [Coach Roy] Time out!
listen, I don't mind you embarrassin' yourselves...
cause you're used to it, okay?
but now, you're startin' to embarrass me.
what's your name? - My name's Keith.
Keith, do you think you can, uh, try not to turn the ball over?
guys, I need you to get out there and go to work, okay?
and try to keep it in single digits. Let's go, guys. Let's go!
[Scoffs] We wouldn't wanna humiliate him.
that's a winning attitude.
Keith, the ball! - Hey.
what is he doing?
[All] Two! Four! Six! Eight! Who do we appreciate?
Smelters!
what'll those Canadians think of next? Speaking of animal lovers...
in a follow-up to a recent story...
former N.C.B.A. Madman Coach Roy McCormick lost his first game today...
former N. C.B. A. Madman Coach Roy McCormick lost his first game today...
in the cutthroat middle school division!
[Laughter] - I swear to God.
109 to nothing. For real!
he has to teach the kids fundamentals, things like which basket is ours.
[Man] Yeah, like jump ball means that your team has gotta jump too.
look, Roy's gotta do a betterjob if he wants to coach again in the N.C.B.A.
it's that simple. - [Phone Ringing]
Oh, sh - Oh!
Yeah.
uh, what the heck are you doin'?
Hey, man, what's the big deal, okay? It's middle school. Who cares?
who cares? That's what I said. But, you know, Roy, it made all the national news.
and I had some solid job offers lined up, and now everyone's bailed on us.
look, nobody wants to hire... a loser.
look, you gotta win at least one game with these kids if you ever wanna work again.
Oh, hi. Are you Mr. McCormick?
I'm a big fan. Can I please have your autograph?
sure thing, young lady.
thank you. - [Car Engine Starting]
wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's my car. - That was your car.
it was part of your endorsement deal, and that's been terminated.
have a great day. I still think you're great.
I want my old life back.
huddle up!
now, I'm gonna be honest with you.
I can't afford to lose by triple digits again, or else I'm finished.
so I've decided to teach you how to play the game of basketball.
Yeah, the concept of dribbling, passing and scoring, okay?
so playtime is over. And if you don't like it, the door is right there.
get back here!
I'm gonna need some help.
unbelievable.
give me that! - [Both Shouting]
get off me, boy! You want some too? - [Funk]
unbelievable!
what? - She started it.
shut up! - Go on. You're comin' with me.
look who's in trouble again. - You got somethin' to say?
look, these ain't even allowed in school. Okay?
you a natural. What's your name?
you're comin' with me, all right? - Oh, no. I'm not - No.
I'm not goin' to detention.
it's more like a work release program.
all right? Trust me. Suit up.
come on. Come on, Big Mac. Suit up.
trust me.
whoa. Yao Ming, wait up.
what a dork. - Sorry.
Hey. - Excuse me.
can I help you? - I just wanted to talk to one of your players.
players"? These are my students.
and, no, while Wes is in my class, you can't speak to him.
I'll come back later, okay?
look. Wes is really shy, okay?
and he's not into sports, and he really doesn't need to be pushed around by your type.
my type? - Mm-hmm.
what's my type, since you know me? What's my type?
a bully.
a stubborn, spoiled, always-gets-his-way bully.
you're good.
thank you. - Mm-hmm.
I'll come back after class.
but I do gotta ask somethin'. Look, son, you like basketball?
um, I'm not very coordinated.
man, that's perfect.
nobody else on the team is coordinated.
so join us, please. It's perfect.
you - out! - Just give me one second.
thirty seconds, all right? All right?
son, do you know what everybody wants out of life?
no. - They wanna be loved.
I love you, because...
you are six feet, man...
with extremely long arms, you know?
now, I can't promise you if you join the team that you're gonna get the girls.
I can't- I can help you, you know, see where they at...
but I can't help you get the girls, you know.
and I can't even promise that you're gonna be a good player.
but what I can guarantee you is that, uh...
you won't be the butt of nobody's jokes, son.
how tall are you, son? - Six-two.
Six-two?
I'm deeper and deeper in love!
Wow! Six-two!
will you join us?
I, uh
I have to wear a T-shirt under my jersey...
cause my perspiration gives me dermatitis.
meet me at the gym at 3: 00, 'cause, uh, we practice hard.
I'll be there.
my man. All right.
careful. - Yeah. Thanks.
I'm watchin' you. - Thank you.
[Coach Roy] These here are the new recruits.
this is Wes. You mess with him, you're gonna have to answer to me.
this is Big Mac.
you mess with her, well, you're on your own.
[Man] Are the Smelters running a drill?
Hey, I think that's the girl that stole my wife's car.
don't stare.
just out of curiosity, how long you been shootin' hoops?
for a while in juvie.
well, you're our enforcer, okay?
don't mean you gotta fight. But you got five fouls.
don't be afraid to use 'em.
I don't mind fightin'. - I'm sure.
but you have good hands, and you have good footwork. Use 'em.
that's not what I'm talkin' about.
Yeah, Coach?
look, do yourself a favor. Don't warm up today, all right?
but l - I know. You never, ever played basketball.
but for the next 15 minutes, that's our little secret, okay?
all right. - [Door Opens]
my secret weapon.
no weapon form against thee... shall prosper.
how you doin', my brother?
you always come through for a brother. Hey!
God bless you!
Oh, brother! - Thank you.
you're shinin'. You're shinin' like the light.
look, I got about four or five other engagements I need to get to.
so if we can kind of put a little pep in the step, get this thing movin'.
not a problem. Smelters?
God bless you, basketball babies. How you doin'?
[Muttering Responses] - I'm Preacher Don.
and Coach Roy asked me to come down here and speak with you.
so if l- if I may, I would like to say a prayer with you and coach Roy...
if that's all right.
let's bow our heads, please.
God is good.
God is great.
thank you for this game we're about to receive...
cause we about to get up in them.
thank you for the food that we about to- No, that's the wrong prayer.
God, we ask that you give us the strength...
that everything will go our way out there on the court.
and if that cannot happen, God...
we ask that you injure some key players on the other team...
not so that they get seriously injured...
but that they're slowed up...
so that the Smelters will win this game.
Amen! Amen.
because we know you - God - loves a winner.
[sniffling] Can I get an "amen"?
[All] Amen.
I'm gonna need that cash real quick.
Oh, no problem. - [Buzzer Sounds]
[Blows Whistle] - Back off!
in her rookie debut, Margaret "Big Mac" Green...
won the Smelters' first tip-off since
when's the last time we won a tip? Quick. - Um- '89.
two years before we were born.
wait. Uh - Where do we write our points?
I don't know. We've never had to before.
technical foul, Mount Vernon!
what's wrong with you? - It's a technical foul. Delay of game.
I'm not talkin' to you. I'm talkin' to them.
look, you can't have a parade every time you score.
now, get back out there and get your heads in the game.
let's go!
big Mac, you really tryin' my patience.
substitution. Substitution, ref.
I'm bringin' in Sledgehammer. Sledge?
ref, let's get an I.D. Check here. This kid looks old enough to drink.
look, I'm whisperin', okay? I need you to nod your head...
and act like I'm sayin' somethin' important.
I need you to go out here, be cool...
and try not to trip.
can you do that?
I - I think so, Coach. - Thank you, son.
come on.
diamond and one. Diamond and one. Let's go.
set it up. - [Man] Okay, double-team the kid.
double-team the Sledgehammer.
Sledge? Hey? Give me
give me some shake and bake, baby. A double shake and bake.
you know? With a little bit of this, that. [Growling]
double it up. You know what I'm sayin'? All right?
bang with 'em. - What's that?
Hey, hold your ground, okay? Show 'em what it's like to be with the big boy.
bang with 'em. - You feel me?
sledgehammer, huh? Take it to the iron, boys! They're soft inside!
out. - [Whistle Blows]
Hey, you did good, son, all right?
you hung in there a lot longer than I thought you would.
have a seat. Ralph.
you're in.
[Groans] Thanks.
[Whistle Blowing] - [Coach Roy] Come on! Let's go!
Congratulations. You only lost by 45.
that's why you're doin' 45 suicides.
now, let's go. What? What are you doin'here?
what? - Coach, what happens if we win?
fuzzy, if you win- if you win
I'll do a suicide for every point you win by, okay?
now, dig it out! Get back to work.
see the way you're runnin'? That's why you're losin'.
you may wanna embarrass you, but you're not gonna embarrass me!
I pulled out every trick in the book today.
these aren't college kids, Roy. They're 13.
[Sighs] - I mean, you were 13 once, right?
only one thing motivates a 13-year-old boy...
and it ain't Smelter pride.
I just said something smart.
I'm gonna write that down. - [Chuckles]
ladies, free pizza here.
come by the gym, get a slice. All you want. All you want.
all right? [Sniffing]
cheese, yeah. Cheese. Excuse me.
is he serious? - Come on!
my mouth's waterin' already. I can't wait to get to this pizza, y'all.
Hey, did you get the Cinnabon? - Whoa.
cause they supposed to give us a free Cinnabon that goes with these pizzas.
pizza!
guys, layup lines.
but - Layup lines. Come on.
all right. - Is there always gonna be pizza here?
there will be from now on.
you're home ec, right? - Yeah.
how's your pizzas? - Delicious-y for shizzy.
all right. Okay, good, 'cause that's your new job.
you straight? - Yes.
Oh. I will not let you down. - All right.
okay. - All right.
there's chicken parm in the crust, ladies, so put your feed bags on.
Hey, green team out. Green team out.
so who are we playin'? - Me.
you the ball handler, huh? Yeah, that's right. I see you. You kinda tight with that rock.
you like to go to the basket. Ain't no "l" in team, huh?
it's about you. Do your thing, man.
check it.
Ooh! Did I anger you? - Just give me the ball.
Oh! What's the Shaq do? What's that move he do when he block people?
no, Mutombo. He do like this.
[Imitating Mutombo] "I don't think that you should bring it in there."
you should get it to one of your teammates.
let's see what you got, man. You gotta use your teammates sometime, man.
huh? Uh-oh. Look, he's mad now.
Ooh! See, when I get blocked, I start looking for my teammates.
you know what I mean? 'Cause they can help me out.
you know? Wow!
but if I get the ball to them late, watch what happens.
I didn't wanna do it. - I didn't wanna do it.
[Panting] I'm hungry.
what's wrong with you? Pass the ball!
dude, come on. Just pass it. We'll give it right back.
come on. Let's go.
[Chuckles] Wait a minute. Comin' at ya.
comin' at - [Laughs]
Comin'at ya. Look. All right.
[Groans] - All right.
you passed the ball, man. How does that feel...
for the ball to go from your hand to another hand?
again. Try it again. Let me show you how you do the one thing.
huh? All right. All right, all right.
all right. All right. All right.
all right. I'm gonna admit, I'm a little tired.
the point I'm tryin'to prove is that teamwork beats out talent any day.
now, one on one, neither one of y'all could beat me.
you know, that's just real. But all five of y'all together...
if y'all play as a team, you might could do something with me.
and I'm gonna keep it real with you like that. [Coughs]
but anyway, l
I gotta- I gotta go throw up.
green team, you're in!
let's go, guys.
one Love, hedge that ball screen.
right there. There you go. Right there. A'ight?
go to Mac. Mac. - Here.
all right. Who can tell me, again...
the highly complex way of beating the pick-and-roll?
somebody?
talking?
talking.
exactly. Talking.
guys, you gotta communicate out there. You're a team.
all right? Communication is the key.
it's like a-a healthy relationship at home.
you know?
you ever flirt around with your lady? You know, your lady say
you, like, "Come on. Come on." Your lady is, like...
no, no, not right now. Remember?
you said that you wanted to take some time to
huh? - You know what?
run the play again till you get it right.
run it! Come on, guys.
ladies, I'm not seeing none of those "R!" You know.
I ain't seein' none of that. Let's go.
come on, people. Guys, communicate out there.
in my opinion, he's more interested in endorsements than winning basketball games.
it's that simple.
Hey! Hi. I'm coach Roy.
when I get hot under the collar...
I cool off with Cool Breeze.
[Man] See, Coach Roy is slippin; because right now...
his best statistic on the season-eight technical fouls in his last eight games.
that's hardly championship coaching. - [Audience Laughing]
[Man] You ate eight hamburgers at lunch.
look, the fact is this. Roy has lost touch with the fundamentals...
and he's also lost touch with his team.
y'all can take some pictures, but I'm not gonna be able to sign any autographs right now.
as you can see, I'm very busy.
Roy better get his stuff together, because otherwise, he'll be coaching at Devry.
and they don't even have a basketball team.
and that's the joke, see?
[Coach Roy] Okay, guys, real important game today.
I need you to be 100%.
unfortunately, I can't be there. I'm doin' a photo shoot for Details magazine.
it's gonna run late. I'll be there at halftime, and you'd better not lose...
because losing makes me look bad. - [Tape Clicks]
[Man] Coach Roy cannot be happy right now, Jack.
his team has a lot of work to do, and not much time to do it.
it is crunch time. This is where we're gonna find out...
what these two teams and their coaches are really made of.
[Whistle Blowing] - What are you callin'?
what are you callin', Earl? Earl, what is that? What is that?
keep it up, Roy. Just one more word.
Hey, coach, this is my nest! This is my nest!
you need to do an endorsement for Altoids. Your breath is humming!
Hey, clown.
you keep runnin' your mouth, I'm gonna come over there and rearrange your beak.
you talkin' smack? You talkin' smack, huh? You talkin' smack?
shut up.
no basket. - What?
why don't we play jacks? 'Cause we're not playin' basketball.
[Whistle Blowing] - Technical foul, coach Roy.
I - I was way over there!
that's two. You're out of here!
just because - did I do this? - Don't touch my whistle.
did I do that? Did I do that?
that's why you give me a tech! - [Referee] Hit the showers.
no, you hit the showers, Earl! You hit the showers!
I'm not hittin' no showers!
[Laughing] Yeah! Kick him out! Kick him out!
y'all didn't even ask me what went on. Y'all just snatched me.
you know what?
coach Roy killed Victor!
[Booing, Shouting] - You're crazy!
I feel bad. I feel real bad.
out there havin' temper tantrums and arguin' with the refs.
man, I should know better than that.
you represent everything that's wrong with college sports today.
you don't care about the players. You don't care about the game.
if things don't go your way, you explode like a spoiled child.
look, if you're gonna fine me, fine me, man.
how much? 'Cause I ain't got all day.
it's time for me to bounce. What's happenin'?
it is with such pleasure that I say...
that you, Roy McCormick...
that you're officially banned from coaching in the N.C.B.A. For the remainder of your life.
you bannin' me, huh? Yeah. Okay.
I been here longer than all y'all.
you forgot about the three championships I won, didn't you, Mr. Vice President? Huh?
and now you wanna ban me? No, I'm bannin' you. I'm bannin' you for life.
can he ban us? - Of course not! Stand up straight.
excuse me, gentlemen. "Prior to a lifetime ban... offending coach must be granted an opportunity to demonstrate compliance."
if offending coach completes the remainder of the season without any infractions
ejections, criminal malfeasance, etcetera
he must be readmitted on a probationary basis.
in short, you gotta give Roy one last chance to prove himself.
watch your temper, Roy. Good luck finding another team.
we should go.
and then, I'm gonna smash the guitar.
good, 'cause if you don't, I will.
dad call?
he comin' to this game?
[Sighs] Keep practicin', okay?
come on. We're late.
Hey, hold it. Hold it.
okay, look. I would love to tell you...
that everybody you meet in this life was gonna be great...
and you could always count on those people.
that'd be a lie. Your dad's not a part of our lives anymore, all right?
but I got your back, and I'm gonna keep havin' your back.
so before you go givin' up on this world...
you need to wait till you're about 18 like everybody else, all right?
mom, if you're so smart, how'd you end up with Dad in the first place?
okay, you know what? You're too smart for your own good.
I'll see you at the tip-off. - All right, Mom.
because if I hadn't, l - I wouldn't have had you.
I wouldn't have had you.
I always think of the good mom stuff after he's gone. Crazy.
it's game day here at Mount Vernon.
let's take a moment to review the Smelters' starting lineup.
first off, we have Keith Ellis.
now, everyone knows Keith Ellis is the best player on the team, including Keith.
[Girl #2] At power forward is One Love.
okay, now, the only thing One Love loves more than playing basketball... is his shoes, um...
his hair, his image, and his shoes again.
at point guard, we've got Ralph.
the kid has got four older brothers, okay?
all of them were all-star athletes.
I mean, the pressure to succeed is tremendous. - [Vomiting]
returning as small forward is the player with the best attitude...
and the worst vision.
last year, he held the record for the most balls to the face.
luckily, this year, he has a solution. - And a new nickname, Annie.
everyone's callin'the kid Goggles.
rounding out the starting five is Fuzzy.
now, we have high expectations for the kid.
I mean, word on the street is that he's been bulking up...
specifically for this season.
and, of course, the coach of our intrepid team and home ec teacher...
Mr. Newirth.
while he's never coached before or even played the game ofbasketball...
he proved to the administration he was exactly what they were looking for.
Oh, yeah? How?
he volunteered for the job. - Okay.
get a shoe contract yet, One Love?
not yet. - Bam!
your deal.
court's free. You little guys wanna warm up?
what for?
want a cookie?
you spit on this? - No.
all right. - [Girl] Game nine, and the pressure is on.
but you couldn't tell by looking at the calm, confident faces of the Smelters...
easily the best 0-8 team in the league...
hungry to avenge their nail-biting loss last week.
86 to zero.
in which the Smelters were subjected to several hundred bad calls.
[All] Break!
[One Love] One Love's cutting! One Love's open!
one Love is open!
