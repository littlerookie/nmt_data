keynes and Hayek argued about whether government
keynes and Hayek saw that too, but Marx was the first
keynes and Russell had both been there.
keynes appreciated the classical model's elegance and consistency, virtues economists still crave.
keynes brought in the state to redress the failings of society not because he loved it, but because he saw it, in the last resort, as the saviour of capitalism from the temptations of collectivism or worse.
keynes deliberately misrepresented the views of his opponents.
keynes demonstrated that equilibrium was likely in another situation also.
keynes disliked the "fetish of liquidity" but accepted that it was necessary to persuade investors to take risks.
keynes foresaw the inevitability of such interference from the board clearly as he shaped those institutions at bretton woods in 1944.
keynes had not experienced quarterly benchmarking and never submitted his results to a performance measurement service.
keynes hayek: the clash that defined modern economics
keynes lost the argument then, but governments have been returning to it ever since.
keynes observed the interrelationships among income, savings, consumption, investment and interest rates; he believed that the amount of private investment taking place in an economy dictates whether or not the system stagnates or expands.
keynes opened the way to political economy; but economists opted for a regressive research programme, disguised by sophisticated mathematics, that set it apart.
keynes perceived a further paradox.
keynes saw that market efficiency, in a practitioner's sense, might be a force for economic instability.
keynes saw the problem long before anyone talked about a digital age.
keynes straddled the old world notion that the best a member of the working classes could do was to accept his station in life, and the new world order in which it was accepted that nations and people could make their own destinies.
keynes taught us that budget deficits are essential for countercyclical policies in times of deflation yet governments everywhere feel compelled to reduce them under pressure from the financial markets.
keynes think that country should count out active fiscal policy to conquer economic recession, and fiscal income and expenses also have tight relation with monetary supply and demand, so, this thesis open the deflation's investigation eyeshot up to fiscal policy.
keynes was posted to the india office, but the civil service proved deadly dull, and he soon left.
keynes would be horrified that the world has let the genie of free capital flows out of the bottle.
keynes would have interpreted this as an extreme outbreak of liquidity-preference, says paul davidson, whose biography of the master has just been republished with a new afterword.
keynes would trade from bed; schumpeter spent a decade paying off debts incurred in the collapse of central european financial institutions.
keynes wrote the "general theory of employment, interest and money," which was published in 1936, in an "unnecessarily controversial tone," according to some readers.
keynes's famous description of the gold standard as a "barbarous relic" does not quite capture his opinion of the metal, which he thought would be useful as a constitutional monarch but disastrous as a despot.
keynes's idea was squashed by the americans, who stood to lose from it.
keynes's liquidity trap represents a process whereby the public prefers cash to bonds.
keynes's middle way would avoid the unemployment and the panics and manias of capitalism.
keynes's popular achievement, schumpeter had observed, was to project "his own personal view" through "an apparently general analysis."
keynes, he observes, was a "consummate insider," who understood the theory he was demolishing precisely because he was once convinced by it.
keynes, he observes, was a "consummate insider," who understood the theory he was demolishing precisely because he was once convinced by it.
keynes, not coincidentally, had nothing to say about the proper components of fiscal stimulus.
keynes, representing britain, was obsessed with the dangers of asymmetric adjustment between surplus and deficit countries.

keynesian economics not only increased the amount of public debt over time, but also introduced a completely new rationale for running deficits that eroded the traditional disapproval of borrowing to finance pure consumption.
keynesian economics, Paleolithic migrations.
keynesian economics.
keynesian economist and nobel laureate paul krugman voiced his concern about this bill in the new york times with his emphasis that "there will be big spending cuts."
keynesian economists are also likely to counter the canadian example with that of ireland today, where a willingness to appease the bond markets with budget cuts has been accompanied by a fall in nominal gdp of almost a fifth.
keynesian economists blame the sluggish us growth and lack of job creation on the insufficiency of stimulus measures.
keynesian economists fail to realize that when price inflation breaks out, it becomes impossible to contain unless interest rates are immediately raised to a level that is higher than the real rate of price inflation.
keynesian economists have the mistaken belief that all recessions are bad and must be suppressed by government interference in the free market.
keynesian economists often dismiss these long-run concerns when the economy has short-run problems.
keynesian macroeconomics argues for deficit spending.
keynesian policy merely justified ever larger budget deficits and higher inflation, until policymakers understood that it led only to higher permanent unemployment.
keynesian theory suffers from a rather glaring logical fallacy.
keynesian theory suffers from a rather glaring logical fallacy.
Keynesian? Uh, the Greeks?
keynesianism may be about trying to maintain full employment, but keynes understood that full employment could mean everybody who wanted a job working up to three hours a day, at which frenetic pace we should still have twice the wealth of keynes's generation.
keynesianism, as a system of macroeconomic theory and economic policy, with state inteiference as its core and the solution of capitalist economic crisis and employment as its goal, was quite popular then among the ruling classes of all major capitalist countries and was adopted in their economic legislation.
keynesians can note the excess savings of the private sector.
keynesians suggested that "incomes policies" or wage and price controls, could fix the problem, while friedman's monetarists argued that only the fed could bring inflation to heel.
