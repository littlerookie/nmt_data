gunvor almost only offered and sold oil in the platts moc window. That is because it buys oil off the spot market under tender on long-term contracts with russian producers and thus has a lot of oil to sell.
gunvor denies that it has manipulated the market, and platts rejects the idea that our statistical analysis is a substitute for its own "rigorous market observation and analysis."
gunvor would not have to change the price of the oil it is trading by more than a few cents to make a decent return, because it trades such huge volumes.
gunvor's analysts might have had their own private forecasters who could spot objective factors that other traders did not.
Gunvor, or related parties, could trade in futures markets-though you might then expect its counterparties eventually to realize that the market was hard to make money in.
