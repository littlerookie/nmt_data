bp 'has gained stranglehold over iraq' after oilfield deal is rewritten
bp (which insists that rosneft wholly supports it) expects to be able to reach a settlement with mr fridman and his partners. But the divorce is likely to be costly.
bp accused halliburton, one of its main contractors in the stricken deepwater horizon project, of destroying test results from the cement that halliburton used on the rig before it exploded.
bp agreed to sell its carson oil refinery in california to tesoro for$ 2.5 billion.
bp agreed to sell oil and gas-fields worth$ 7 billion in america, canada and egypt to apache corporation, a texan company.
bp agreed to set aside twenty billion dollars to pay claims and damages to people working in the area's fishing and tourism industries.
bp also commissioned at least three background checks into tnk prior to forming the joint venture.
bp also fired the head of its exploration division and said it is undergoing a big reorganisation of its safety operations ahead of the arrival of robert dudley, its new boss, on october 1st.
bp also said the test 'was performed in accordance with procedures established by bp and approved' by federal regulators.
bp alternative energy was given its own headquarters in county hall opposite the houses of parliament two years ago and its managing director, vivienne cox, oversaw a small division of 80 staff concentrating on wind and solar power.
bp and a team of government officials and scientists are reviewing the data to decide whether they can keep the cap sealed until bp finishes drilling the relief wells that will be used to permanently plug the leak with mud and cement next month.

al-qaeda has been decapitated by american drones and marginalised by the arab uprisings.
al-qaeda has long advocated the creation of self-starting, independent terrorist cells.
al-qaeda has woven many strands of grievance into a simple single narrative: islam is under attack from all sides; america, the west, the jews (along with puppet arab leaders and treacherous shias) are to blame; it is the duty of every muslim to fight them; and muslims who object are apostates.
